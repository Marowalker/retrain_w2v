Super-resolution
microscopy, or nanoscopy, revolutionized the field
of cell biology, enabling researchers to visualize cellular structures
with nanometric resolution, single-molecule sensitivity, and in multiple
colors. However, the impact of these techniques goes beyond biology
as the fields of nanotechnology and nanomedicine can greatly benefit
from them, as well. Nanoscopy can visualize nanostructures in vitro and in cells and can contribute to the characterization
of their structures and nano–bio interactions. In this Perspective,
we discuss the potential of super-resolution imaging for nanomedicine
research, its technical challenges, and the future developments we
envision for this technology.

==== Body
In the past
few decades, the
advent of super-resolution optical microscopy, or nanoscopy, overcame
the diffraction limit of light and extended the realm of fluorescence
microscopy to the nanoscale.1 This advance
had significant impact on cell biology, enabling researchers to unveil
the structural details of subdiffraction cellular architectures. Although
the initial application of nanoscopy was imaging cellular structures,2 its potential goes beyond biology. In the past
5 years, the use of fluorescence nanoscopy has been extended to include
nanotechnology and material science, as well.3 In this Perspective, we reflect on the potential of super-resolution
microscopy to contribute to the field of nanomedicine with a focus
on its ability to shine new light on the properties and behavior of
nanomaterials in vitro and in cells. We discuss the
main technical challenges and abilities of the different methods (see Figure 1), providing a guide
to nanotechnologists approaching these new and exciting techniques.
Finally, we envision the role of nanoscopy in promoting a more rational
design of nanomaterials for medicine.

Figure 1 Super-resolution microscopy. Schematic
representation of super-resolution
methods and their performances. Three main families can be identified:
(i) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) methods and their point
scanning variations where the sample is irradiated with patterned
illumination and the resolution is enhanced through mathematical reconstruction;
(ii) stimulated emission depletion (STED) where a de-excitation doughnut
is scanned around the excitation beam, resulting in the confinement
of the excitation and subsequent enhancement of resolution; and (iii)
single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) where individual fluorophores
are sequentially localized and the image reconstructed in a pointillistic
fashion. Many SMLM variants are available, depending on the mechanisms
of single-molecule control: stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy
(STORM), photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), ground-state
depletion (GSD), and point accumulation for imaging nanotopography
(PAINT). Notably, it is important to compare the techniques’
performances with the properties of the material under study (top
left).

Why Super-resolution for Nanomedicine?
The field of
nanomedicine is currently in a critical moment. Despite numerous reports
in the past decade describing novel nanomaterials with therapeutic
potential, clinical translation is still unsatisfactory and only a
few drug and gene carriers are FDA- and EMA-approved.4 Several recent reviews have discussed what must be improved
upon in the current approach to design the next generation of effective
therapeutic nanomaterials.5−9 In this framework, there is consensus that one of the limiting factors
is our lack of basic knowledge on nanocarrier behavior in the biological
environment, that is, the nanomedicine black box (see Figure 2). Understanding key phenomena
such as protein corona formation, immune escape, extravasation, and
targeting is critical for the rational design of effective materials.
Novel spectroscopy and microscopy techniques that can reveal the behavior
of nanomaterials in complex cellular and tissue environments are of
outmost importance, and super-resolution imaging can play an important
role due to its appealing features.

Figure 2 Opening the nanomedicine black box. Pictorial
representation of
the journey of a nanoparticle from the injection site to the target
tissue (cancer). Several barriers have to be overcome in blood (protein
corona, immune system), tissues (extravasation, matrix diffusion),
and cells (membrane targeting, cell uptake, endosomal escape, and
cell trafficking). Super-resolution imaging can shed light on the
mechanisms of these phenomena, contributing to opening the black box
of nanomedicine.

First, super-resolution
microscopy enables nanometric resolution
whereby researchers can image nanostructured materials down to tens
of nanometers in vitro and in cells. This functionality
paves the way for determining nanoparticles’ sizes and morphologies
accurately, both before and after cell administration. Second, nanoscopy
retains a key feature of conventional fluorescence imaging, the multicolor
ability, which is of paramount importance for imaging interactions
between two or more molecular partners and is one of the reasons for
the success of nanoscopy in biology. Being able to label the materials
of interest in one or more colors and biomolecular partners in different
colors enables the study of key binding events such as protein corona
formation, immune recognition, and targeting. Finally, the molecular
specificity of nanoscopy labeling enables researchers not only to
track single nanoparticles but also to follow a specific molecular
species in space and time, including tracking payload molecules’
loading and release and identifying changes in the nanoparticles’
molecular structures and compositions.

This information, which
is typically inaccessible or accessible
only with indirect methods, is critical for the design of new nanoparticles
and elucidating their function, contributing to opening the “nanomedicine
black box” and providing a guide to understand the biological
barriers to the therapeutic target.

Nanomedicine in Multicolor
Researchers currently study
the structure of nanoparticles with a combination of ensemble techniques
(dynamic light scattering,10 DLS; small-angle
X-ray scattering11) and imaging (atomic
force microscopy,12 electron microscopy13). Super-resolution microscopy can complement
these methods, providing molecule-specific information at the single-nanoparticle
level. Due to fluorescence labeling, a precise molecular component
can be tracked. As a relevant example, a recent report demonstrated
the ability of stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)
to measure the loss of antibodies due to interactions with serum proteins.14 Moreover, multiple components can be visualized
at the same time, paving the way for the intraparticle mapping of
features and functionalities. Meijer and co-workers used this capability
to image multiple monomer types inside a supramolecular polymer, highlighting
their positions and their different dynamics inside the fibers.15 Notably, super-resolution microscopy routinely
enables two- or three-color imaging and can be expanded to a theoretically
unlimited number of channels in the case of DNA point accumulation
for imaging nanotopography (DNA-PAINT),16 enabling the full characterization of complex and multifunctional
drug and gene carriers.

Dynamic Information from Static Pictures
The multicolor
ability of nanoscopy can also be exploited for an unexpected use:
studying the dynamic behavior of self-assembled materials. Supramolecular
drug carriers are endowed with novel properties such as adaptivity
and responsivity to external stimuli because they continuously rearrange
their conformations through molecule exchange or diffusion. However,
most super-resolution methods have limited temporal resolution (see Figure 1) and appear unsuitable
for live imaging of materials. Labeling two batches of the same material
with two separate colors and mixing them after equilibration enables
researchers to follow the dynamic exchange of molecules between the
species. In this case, the temporal information is encrypted in the
color: It is possible to track a “red” molecule jumping
into a “green” structure and, thus, follow monomer exchange
in time and space. This strategy has been used to probe the dynamics
of supramolecular fibers17−19 and in polymer assemblies20in vitro at the single-particle
and molecular levels by two-color STORM. Tracking the exchange of
monomers between structures reveals the underlying kinetics and mechanisms.
The use of smart labeling strategies will enable researchers to probe
the dynamics of supramolecular drug carriers such as micelles, nanoparticles,
and liposomes while in biological fluids and cells.21

A Quantitative Look: Toward Molecular Counting
A typical
strategy for obtaining functional materials is to conjugate moieties
such as targeting ligands, contrast agents, and bioactive compounds
covalently or noncovalently on the particle surface. However, after
synthesis, it is not straightforward to get quantitative estimates
of the numbers and the activities of the active functionalities on
a single-particle basis. Estimates can be achieved using single-molecule-based
techniques such as STORM, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM),
and DNA-PAINT, as they are endowed with single-molecule sensitivity
and enable a reliable quantification.22−27 In a recent example, van Oijen and co-workers quantified the amount
of antibodies present on liposome surfaces and their stoichiometry
using single-molecule imaging.28 Moreover,
a smart labeling strategy can be used to quantify the fraction of
antibody that is correctly oriented for binding using
DNA-PAINT.29 The extension of these methods
to other types of materials and functionalizations is a logical next
step to understanding the behavior of targeted materials quantitatively.

More than Structure: Toward Functional Imaging
The
environmental sensitivity of fluorescent dyes opens new avenues in
the functional imaging of nanostructures, as properties such as hydrophobicity
and charge are important drivers of nanoparticles’ behavior
in cells and in vivo. For this purpose, sensing fluorophores
can be used in combination with single-molecule localization microscopy
(SMLM) imaging. With a small change in the optical setup, it is possible
to record both the position of an emitter and its spectrum; because
many dyes change their emission spectra depending on the environment,
this method can be used for functional imaging.30 The pioneering work of Lee and Xu demonstrated the use
of spectrally resolved PAINT (sPAINT) to image the hydrophobicity
of liposomes with different compositions31 and liquid nanodemixing at the interface, respectively.32 Moreover, the chemical reactivity of nanoparticles
can be measured using turn-on probes and SMLM. In these methods, such
as nanometer accuracy by stochastic catalytic reactions microscopy
(NASCA),33 individual chemical reactions
are probed in space and time, enabling researchers to map the surface
reactivity of catalytic materials. Altogether, these pioneering results
show that the combination of smart probes and super-resolution imaging
enables researchers to go beyond simple structure visualization, offering
wider functional characterization.

Imaging Materials’ Nano–Bio Interactions
A
critical step for the design of effective nanomedicines is understanding
and controlling the interactions of synthetic materials with biological
molecules and machinery. To date, fluorescence, due to its multicolor
ability, has been the primary technique for this purpose. Nanoscopy
will extend this potential to nanoscale spatial resolution, unveiling
nano–bio interactions at the molecular level. The colocalization
of nanoparticles’ fluorescent signal with the signal of a specific
cellular structure is the most used method to probe the localization
and interactions of synthetic objects with a specific cellular compartment,34 for example, with endosomal vesicles to understand
the pathway of internalization of nanoparticles. However, the limited
resolution of conventional microscopy often makes colocalization unclear
and ambiguously interpreted. Super-resolution colocalization assays
will offer dramatic improvements. The next generation of nanoscale
colocalization will change from correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson coefficient) to evaluations of the spatial proximity of
two objects as a parameter of interaction.35−37 Recent work
by Caruso, Cavalieri, and co-workers demonstrated the potential of
this approach, showing how nanoscale colocalization can provide new
information on endosome escape.38

Nanoscopy will also enable the direct visualization of molecular
interactions. A relevant case is represented by the study of protein
corona formation, where the binding between serum proteins and nanoparticles
can be investigated at the single-protein level. Two recent reports
demonstrated the possibility of using STORM to image corona formation
with nanometric resolution and protein specificity.14,39 Dynamic light scattering and proteomics are high-throughput methods
to study corona in vitro: super-resolution will enable
researchers to “zoom in” at the molecular level and
to follow the corona in real time inside cells. The extension of these
methods to other relevant biointeractions, both in vitro or in cells, will extend our knowledge of the nanoparticles’
interactions.

Not Only Where, But Also How
Thus far, we have described
the potential of super-resolution imaging to contribute to understanding
cellular localization (“where”) and interactions (“with
whom”) of nanoparticles. The nanometric resolution of super-resolution
microscopy opens the further possibility of understanding the state
of the nanostructure materials during their cellular journey (“how”).
After injection into the biological environment, interactions with
biomolecules and cellular structures can modify nanoparticles’
sizes, shapes, and compositions. As an example, structure illumination
microscopy (SIM) has been used to monitor particle deformation during
internalization.40 Interestingly, different
cell lines exert different mechanical forces, inducing a proportional
polymer capsule’s shrinkage. Moreover, the stability of supramolecular
aggregates in serum and in cells can be followed by STORM, revealing
in what state (assembled or disassembled) the carriers reach different
locations.27 This information is critical
because unstable carriers will disassemble too quickly and be unable
to perform their functions, whereas carriers that are too stable will
result in bioaccumulation, toxicity, and poor drug release.

Super-resolution
for Nanomedicine Roadmap: Faster, Deeper, and
Quantitative
Despite noteworthy accomplishments, super-resolution
imaging is still a young technique, and future technical improvements
are envisioned, several of which will be relevant for the field of
nanomedicine. In this development, the increase of temporal resolution
plays a pivotal role. The relatively slow nature of nanoscopy limits
the imaging of fast events and/or makes the technique low-throughput.
New, parallelized experimental setups,41 machine-learning analysis,42 and new
fluorophores with improved photophysics43,44 are increasing
speed, making fast-occurring phenomena accessible. Notably, minimal
emission fluxes (MINFLUX) broke new records in speed and resolution,
enabling researchers to track molecular movements with 2 nm spatial
and microsecond temporal resolution.45 Recent
improvements have overcome the limited permeation of nanoscopy into
thick samples such as tissues and organs. The combination of clearing
methods with light-sheet illumination schemes46,47 and adaptive optics48 holds great promise
to image nanoparticles in thick tissues, organs, and organisms. The
combination of these technologies will open the way for the use of
nanoscopy in ex vivo samples, such as sections and
whole organs of model animals treated with nanomedicine, and potentially
also in vivo. However, so far, there are few examples
of in vivo nanoscopy, including stimulated emission
depletion (STED) imaging in rodents’ brains49 and adaptive optics-aided lattice light-sheet imaging on
a transparent model organism.50 The use
of intravital nanoscopy for the imaging of nanocarriers and nanodevices
holds great promise for understanding the interactions of synthetic
materials in vivo. Lastly, the development of methods
for the correlative imaging of nanoparticles in vitro and in cells could represent a way to overcome the limitation of
the individual techniques. In correlative imaging, the sample is imaged
with two different modalities and the two images are overlaid to obtain
different information from both methods and get the “best of
both worlds”.51 However, this technique
comes at the cost of cumbersome and technically difficult methods,
and therefore, applications in nanomedicine remain limited.52,53 Combining the atomic resolution of electron microscopy, the structural
information on X-ray imaging and spectroscopy, and the specific labeling
and molecular imaging of nanoscopy could represent the ultimate tool
to characterize therapeutic nanoparticle structures and interactions,
solving open questions in nanomedicine that are currently under debate
due to the lack of suitable methods of investigation.
