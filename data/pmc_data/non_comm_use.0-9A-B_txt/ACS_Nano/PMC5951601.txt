Techniques to analyze
human telomeres are imperative in studying
the molecular mechanism of aging and related diseases. Two important
aspects of telomeres are their length in DNA base pairs (bps) and
their biophysical nanometer dimensions. However, there are currently
no techniques that can simultaneously measure these quantities in
individual cell nuclei. Here, we develop and evaluate a telomere “dual”
gold nanoparticle-fluorescent probe simultaneously compatible with
both X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and super resolution microscopy. We
used silver enhancement to independently visualize the spatial locations
of gold nanoparticles inside the nuclei, comparing to a standard QFISH
(quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization)
probe, and showed good specificity at ∼90%. For sensitivity,
we calculated telomere length based on a DNA/gold binding ratio using
XRF and compared to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
measurements. The sensitivity was low (∼10%), probably because
of steric interference prohibiting the relatively large 10 nm gold
nanoparticles access to DNA space. We then measured the biophysical
characteristics of individual telomeres using super resolution microscopy.
Telomeres that have an average length of ∼10 kbps, have diameters
ranging between ∼60–300 nm. Further, we treated cells
with a telomere-shortening drug and showed there was a small but significant
difference in telomere diameter in drug-treated vs control cells.
We discuss our results in relation to the current debate surrounding
telomere compaction.

==== Body
Telomeres
are repetitive sequences
located at the ends of chromosomes. They have a number of functions
including protecting the chromosomes from degradation and preventing
individual chromosomes from linking to each other. They are also associated
with the aging process and shorten with each cell replication cycle.1 It is accepted that at least 8–10 base
pairs (bps) are lost per cell division due to the “end replication
problem”,2,3 while many more bps are thought
to be eroded due to reactive oxygen species. Measuring these dynamics
is important but technically challenging.

Further, the packing
density of the DNA in telomeres is currently
a focus of research. Bandaria et al.4 recently
proposed that DNA damage response (DDR) complexes are unable to enter
into telomeric regions due to DNA compaction. However, Timashev et
al.5 and Vancevska et al.6 questioned this hypothesis as they found DDR complexes
could colocalize with telomeres, even when purported compaction proteins
were present. Thus, measuring biophysical dimensions of telomeres
is important, as volume and packing density could play a vital role
in biological function.

There are a number of ways to measure
telomere length (in base
pairs of DNA), while there are very few methods that can measure biophysical
characteristics, like volume. Methods such as southern hybridization
can measure average telomere length in bulk homogenate samples.7 Bulk methods mask the heterogeneity that could
occur at each telomere within a nucleus.8,9 For individual
telomeres, a method known as quantitative fluorescence in
situ hybridization (QFISH) uses a short fluorescence oligonucleotide
sequence (made of DNA, or more commonly, PNA) probe for the repeat
motif found in telomeres, visualized with standard fluorescence microscopy.10 Preparing the cells so that they are in the
metaphase allows telomeres to be seen directly on the ends of each
chromosome.11 The length of each telomere
is usually estimated based on fluorescence intensity in arbitrary
fluorescence units, or as a ratio to a centromeric probe of known
length.

However, conventional QFISH measurements do not directly
measure
the absolute length of the DNA nor do they measure the actual spatial
dimensions of the telomere due to the light diffraction limitations
of standard fluorescence imaging. Here we attempt to measure both
of these quantities using a probe that is compatible with both X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) and super resolution microscopy (here using dSTORM;
direct stochastic reconstruction optical microscopy12). We chose XRF as it has excellent sensitivity to gold
and can be absolutely quantitative in measuring numbers of atoms in
a sample as well as having micron resolution.

We conducted a
correlative approach where the two measurements
are obtained on identically prepared samples and found that our probe
could be used with both imaging modalities. We discuss the limitations
and potential improvements that could be made to the method. We also
compare our super resolution results to limited literature values
and discuss the sensitivity of the technique as a method of determining
telomere diameter (or volume).

Results
We constructed the probe
using a gold nanoparticle conjugation
kit (Creative-Diagnostics, NY) and a custom-made fluorescent peptide
nucleic acid (PNA) oligonucleotide (Panagene, Korea). The two components
were conjugated together using the manufacturers protocol (for details,
see Experimental Methods and the Supporting Information). We call our probe GNP-PNA-A647
to represent the important components (for schema, see Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of the
probe design, GNP-PNA-A647. A 10 nm gold nanoparticle
is covalently linked to a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe through
a PEG-linker molecule. The PNA probe has an Alexa-647 fluorescent
molecule at the N-terminus. At either end of the PNA probe there is
also a spacer molecule (for details see the Supporting Information); Lys-O-CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA-O-Lys(Alexa-647). (b)

of GNP-PNA-A647 conjugates. (c) Image is background subtracted (see
the Supporting Information) to enhance
the contrast of the organic shell. (d) Image is then automatically
segmented using an Otsu threshold and the shell properties (e.g.,
area) are measured. (e) Analysis of the shell coating between GNP-PEG
(N = 51) and GNP-PNA-A647 (N = 59)
shows a slight increase in the width, with medians significant (P = 0.001) using a Mann–Whitney-U test. The boxes
have lines at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile values.
The whiskers show the extent of the rest of the data, and the crosses
are outliers.

The gold nanoparticles
are ideal for detection through the characteristic
XRF signal for the Au L-shell, while Alexa-647 is an organic dye that
is widely used in super resolution microscopy. By quantifying the
GNP signal, it is possible to infer how many DNA bases there are in
a telomere, if we can obtain an estimate of the ratio of GNPs to DNA
bases. Quantifying the A647 signal using super resolution microscopy
provides a measure of the actual spatial dimension of the telomere,
rather than the much larger apparent area that is commonly obtained
using diffraction-limited modalities, such as confocal microscopy.

We characterized the GNP-PNA-A647 probe, primarily using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and automated image analysis (see Figure 1b–e, and Experimental Methods for image analysis techniques). Figure 1e shows the equivalent
diameters of the organic shell surrounding GNPs, comparing GNPs (direct
from the manufacturer) and GNP-PNA-A647. Note the GNPs from the manufacturer
are functionalized with a 5 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer, thus
we call them GNP-PEG. The median shell diameter was ∼6.5 nm
and ∼8.5 nm for GNP-PEG vs GNP-PNA-647, respectively, a statistically
significant difference using a Mann–Whitney-U-test.

Our
GNP-PEG measurement is largely in agreement with del Pino et
al.,13 who measured a ∼7–10
nm diameter shell on their GNP-PEG constructs, also using a 5 kDa
PEG molecule. In addition to TEM measurements, we used UV–vis
spectroscopy to measure the characteristic Alexa647 absorption peak
at ∼647 nm, which is present in our purified probe construct
but not present in GNP-PEG samples (see SI Figure 1).

Next, we hybridized our GNP-PNA-A647 probe to telomeres
on human
cells. We used a standard metaphase spread protocol using Human Embryonic
Kidney (HEK-293) cells (see Experimental Methods) to produce well spread out chromosomes on which to perform probe
hybridization. We used an in situ fluorescence hybridization
(FISH) kit (Dako, Denmark), replacing their probe with our own. It
should be noted our FISH protocol (and most FISH protocols in general)
uses proteases and ribonucleases to strip the cell of all components
other than the DNA contained in the nucleus. Thus, the images shown
are solely from DNA. As a control, we probed the cells with GNPs that
lack the PNA-A647.

HEK cells are known to tolerate colcemid
that blocks replication
at the metaphase, which facilitated reproducibly harvesting a large
number of interphase nuclei and, to a lesser extent, metaphase chromosomes.
These can be distinguished based on their appearance: interphase nuclei
are circular as all the individual chromosomes are clustered together
in a circular arrangement; by contrast, the chromosomes in metaphase
have condensed and separated so that that they can be seen individually.

There were technical reasons why we did not concentrate on metaphase
spreads with XRF: beam targeting and time constraints on the XRF system
required focusing on the more numerous interphase nuclei since metaphase
spreads are much less common than interphase nuclei in a sample preparation.

Probe
Sensitivity
The XRF imaging of the samples was
performed with the microprobe of the Microfocus Spectroscopy beamline
I18 at the Diamond Light Source.14 The
data collection time on each pixel was 10 s, which meant that each
region scan generally took about 4 h, depending on the size of the
scan. The beam spot size was 2.5 μm giving the pixel size in
the images in Figure 2. Figure 2a–c
shows an example of a region of six nuclei probed with GNPs-PNA-A647.
The spectrum (Figure 2a) shows a number of elements associated with cells (e.g., Zn, Fe,
Cu) while others are background from the sample stage (e.g., Ga, Ti)
or air (Ar).

(d) XRF spectrum from control cells. (e) Zn map from control cells.
Note the faint lines are chromosomes from a metaphase spread (f) Au
map from control cells. There is no Au signal distinguishable above
the background noise. The GNP-PNA-A647 probe measured telomere length
on average to ∼0.9 kbps (see Table 1 and Table SI 1). By comparing this length to the qPCR length measurement (see Figure 5), our probe has
a sensitivity of ∼10%.

Processing of the raw data was done with PyMCA software and
involves
peak fitting, background removal, and estimation of concentration
levels with the use of a reference material (AXO, Dresden GmbH). In
PyMCA, the reference material is modeled in terms of matrix composition,
density, and thickness and is used to determine the photon flux of
the experiment. The photon flux value is used in conjunction with
the matrix, density, and thickness of our probed samples to measure
the concentration of gold. The matrix and density assumed for our
samples was the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP)
standard soft tissue composition (CNHO, g/cm3). We measured
the thickness of the cell nuclei using two independent techniques.
We used ion beam analysis (IBA)15 and measured
an average nucleus thickness of ∼45 nm (for details please
see the Supporting Information). For comparison,
we used scanning transmission ion microscopy (STIM)16 and measured an average thickness of ∼65 nm (see
the Supporting Information for details)
per nucleus. The two estimates are in reasonable agreement given the
variability in sample preparation and the intrinsic sample heterogeneity.
For XRF data fitting, we performed two fits assuming either a 45 or
65 nm nucleus thickness. The values for the gold concentration shown
in Table 1 are the mean value of these two fits with standard
deviation.

a The mass of each cell nucleus is
derived from its measured perimeter (see green outlines in Figure 2), thickness (55
nm, measured by IBA and STIM) and density (1 g/cm3). The
standard deviation is calculated from the uncertainty of the cell
nucleus thickness (±10 nm). The mass of the Au in each nucleus
is calculated from the parts per million concentration measured by
XRF. The gold nanoparticles are 10 nm in diameter, so assuming that
each GNP binds to 18 bases of DNA and the each nucleus has 86 telomeres,
the average number of bases per telomere can be calculated (see text
for details)

Figure 2b,c shows
Zn and Au elemental concentration maps. The Au Lα peak at 9.7
keV is clearly present in the GNP-PNA-A647 probed cells. A similar
XRF spectrum can be seen for the control (Figure 2d), where cell nuclei were probed with GNPs
but without the PNA-A647 oligonucleotide. Here though, the Zn map
reveals the cell nuclei (Figure 2e) but the Au map (Figure 2f) shows no discernible features.

We
segmented the cells (areas shown in green) and extracted an
average Au mass fraction per nucleus (i.e., the average pixel intensity).
The mass fraction is multiplied by 106 to give the ppm
(parts-per-million by weight) concentration. The ppm concentration
of gold can only be converted into absolute values if one knows the
mass of the matrix, which in this case is the mass of the nucleus.
The mass of the nucleus is derived from the measured perimeter and
average nuclear thickness (55 nm), given the ICRP soft tissue composition
standard density (g/cm3).

Table 1 is a summary
of measurements that allows estimates of the number of gold nanoparticles
in each nucleus. This is calculated from the mass of gold in each
nucleus, divided by the mass of a single gold nanoparticle (which
is 1.01 × 10–17 g; the volume of a 10 nm sphere
is 5.24 × 10–19 cc and the density of gold
is 19.3 g/cm3).

To arrive at an approximate number
of gold nanoparticles per telomere
region, we assumed a binding ratio of 1:18 GNP/telomeric-DNA as determined
by the design of our probe (see Figure 1), and we measured an average 86 ± 23 telomeres
per nucleus by counting the number of Alexa-647 fluorescent dots in N = 20 interphase nuclei (see Figure 3a as an example: the variation in telomeres
is probably due to aneuploidy in HEK cells, thus no two cells are
likely to have exactly the same number of chromosomes and consequently
telomeres). Finally, to calculate the number of DNA base pairs per
telomere, the number of GNPs per nucleus is divided by 86 (to obtain
GNPs per telomere) and then multiplied by 18 (binding ratio). For
the 6 cells we measured shown in Figure 1, we obtain on average about 3500 GNPs per
cell that equates to 740 DNA bases per telomere (see Table 1). When we combine this with
data measured on other cells (see SI Figure 4), the average is ∼4400 GNPs per cell, corresponding to ∼900
bps.

Figure 3 Specificity of the probe. X-ray fluorescence does not have the
resolution for individual telomeres, so the specificity of the probe
was measured using silver enhancement of the gold, compared to a conventional
PNA probe (a) fluorescence signal from a conventional PNA probe, shown
in an interphase nucleus. Part b shows the automatic identification
of the telomeres from part a using an Otsu threshold. Part c shows
brightfield light microscopy of a different nucleus, silver enhanced
to show the locations of gold nanoparticles. The scale bar is 10 μm.
Part d shows the automatic identification of the enhanced gold nanoparticles
from part c. (e) The spatial distributions of the identified fluorescence
regions and silver enhanced gold nanoparticles regions were compared
with nearest neighbor analysis and are very similar, indicating good
specificity.

To measure the actual
length of the average telomere in the HEK
cells, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), an established
method for measuring telomere length.17 Briefly, a 84mer “telomere” PCR template (TGACCA)84 is used in a serial dilution to create a standard curve
of telomere template concentration (equivalent to telomere length)
against cycle time completion. Thus, unknown samples can be measured
against this standard. DNA was extracted from the HEK cells and had
on average 10.2 ± 0.12 kbps long telomeres (see Figure 4a). By comparing this length
to the XRF length measurement using our probe (which gave an average
telomere length of 0.9 kbps), our probe has a sensitivity of ∼10%.
Clearly, the GNPs are not fully covering the telomeric region, which
could potentially be because of their relatively large size (see Discussion).

telomeres from conventional vs super resolution microscopy (where
1 = perfect circle and 0 = ellipse).

Probe Specificity
The X-ray beam size was far too large
to directly visualize individual clusters of GNPs on individual telomeres.
To confirm that GNP-PNA-A647 was binding specifically to the telomere
regions rather than nonspecifically binding to random DNA, we used
silver enhancement. This is a commonly used technique, where silver
ions nucleate around GNPs and grow over time, eventually becoming
large enough to be seen with light microscopy. For specificity analysis,
we compared silver enhanced images (Figure 3c) to images hybridized with PNA-A647 (Figure 3a), a conventional
probe. To quantify the images, we automatically segmented and counted
the dots using a binary threshold (Figure 3b,d) and then took the ratio between the
standard and our probe, as a measure of specificity. From N > 500 dots, the specificity is 87.2% (average 86 dots
per PNA-A647 nucleus and an average of 75 dots per silver stained
nucleus). As an additional measure, we also compared the spatial distribution
of the dots between the standard and our probe, using nearest neighbor
analysis. Figure 3e
shows a histogram of the data. Here, the distributions are similar
and the means are not significantly different in a Mann–Whitney-U
test.

Super Resolution Analysis of Telomeres
As the next
part of our investigation, we used super resolution microscopy to
measure the biophysical dimensions of telomeres. Here, we utilized
the “blinking” characteristics18 of the Alexa-647 molecule on our probe, visualized with direct stochastic
reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). The samples were mounted in an
oxygen-scavenging buffer (for details see Experimental
Methods). Probed nuclei were first imaged using diffraction
limited fluorescence microscopy and then subsequently imaged using
dSTORM for comparison.

Figure 4a shows a representative image of a number of chromosomes
(blue), with the telomeres from light diffraction images (red) overlaid
with the corresponding super resolution images (white). Figure 4b shows the raw data from a
super resolution acquisition from a single telomere and illustrates
the >200 events from the region. This raw data is rendered into
a
super resolution image using a “jittered triangulation”
algorithm,18 illustrated in a magnified
view of a telomere in Figure 4c. An analysis of the spatial properties of telomeres was
then conducted, in both diffraction limited and super resolution images,
and the results are shown in Figure 4d,e. Figure 4d shows the equivalent diameters of the diffraction limited
telomeres ranging between ∼550 and 750 nm, while the super
resolution resolved telomeres range between 60 and 300 nm. Figure 3e shows that the
diffraction-limited telomeres are almost circular, while the super
resolution resolved telomeres are ellipsoidal (or irregular). This
comparison is important, as it shows how diffraction limited images
can lead to erroneous conclusions. Previously it was thought that
telomeres were spheroids,9 while our data
shows they are, in general, ovoid or irregular. Furthermore, by measuring
the actual dimensions of telomeres, as well as their length, the compaction
density of the DNA can be estimated (see Discussion). The circularity (determining surface area) and the DNA density
are both important when considering how enzymes enter into and interact
with the telomere.

Figure 5 shows a comparison between
HEK cells treated with
the drug azidothymidine (AZT) and untreated control HEK cells. AZT
is a putative telomerase inhibitor and has been shown to shorten telomere
lengths in human cells.19 Using qPCR we
measured the lengths of telomeres in the treated and untreated cells
(Figure 5a). The results
show that HEK cells have on average 10.2 ± 0.12 kbps long telomeres,
whereas the HEK-AZT treated cells have on average 9.2 ± 0.12
kbps long telomeres, which is significantly different in a t test at P = 0.005. Figure 5b shows the equivalent diameter of >1500
super resolution measured telomeres from treated and untreated cells.
Here, the median diameter of the untreated HEK and AZT treated cells
is 183 and 169 nm, respectively, which is significantly different
at P = 0.005 using a Mann–Whitney-U test.
Clearly the ranges overlap considerably with a spread of diameters
from ∼60–300 nm. Although the difference is small, it
is still just detectable and mirrors the results seen with the absolute
telomere values measured with qPCR.

(HEK-AZT) cells. (a) The absolute length of telomeres measured by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The error bars show
the standard deviation. The drug-treated cells have on average ∼1
kbp shorter telomeres. (b) The diameters of telomeres (N > 1500) in control vs drug-treated were measured using super
resolution
microscopy. The ranges were between ∼60 and 300 nm, but the
drug treated cells had a slightly lower median (169 nm) than the control
(183 nm), which was significant different in a Mann–Whitney-U
test at P = 0.005.

Discussion
We have developed a gold nanoparticle probe,
designed to measure
length and absolute dimensions of telomeres and have evaluated its
specificity and sensitivity. Over the past 20 years, considerable
efforts have been made to accurately measure the length, biophysical
volume, and density of telomeres, due to their importance in many
areas of aging and cell cycle regulation. Here, we will discuss the
sensitivity and specificity of our GNP probe and then consider the
implications for our super resolution results on the diameters of
telomeres.

We chose synchrotron X-ray fluorescence to measure
the length of
telomeres, as it has the potential to absolutely quantify gold with
micron resolution, and a beam energy which can be “tuned”
to optimize signal from an element of interest, giving it very high
sensitivity (ppm). To our knowledge, no attempt has been made to measure
telomeres with an XRF-compatible probe, although similar probes have
been made for Raman spectroscopy.19 Indeed,
our group has used ion beam analysis (a closely related XRF technique)
to absolutely quantify the numbers of gold nanoparticles and titania
nanoparticles in individual cells as well as other endogenous biological
trace elements such as Ca, P, Na, K, S.20−22

Analysis of our
XRF data indicate that there is on average ∼0.5
pg of gold in probed cell nuclei or about 4400 GNPs. This corresponds
to binding ∼920 bases of DNA if we assume that each GNP binds
to 18 bases and each nucleus has 86 telomeres. Using qPCR which is
a conventional method to measure telomere length, we showed that our
HEK cells had telomeres ∼10 kbps long. This means that the
sensitivity of our probe is ∼10%.

The reason for the
low sensitivity is probably due to steric interference
that the 10 nm GNPs experience with the chromosome structure. That
said, we initially chose 10 nm GNPs as previous reports from Zong
et al.19 had shown good Raman signals from
similarly designed 20 nm gold nanoparticle telomere probes. Zong et
al. did not do a sensitivity analysis of their probe, rather they
compared Raman signal to a centromeric silver probe and measured ratios
of gold to silver signal as a means to compare telomere length on
drug treated vs untreated cells. Our results indicate that is it very
unlikely that their 20 nm sized probe had full coverage of the telomere
length.

As a way to improve sensitivity, ultrasmall NPs (∼1.5
nm)
could be used instead of 10 nm NPs. The caveat here is that there
will be less gold atoms to detect per probe, perhaps beyond the sensitivity
of XRF. On the other hand, the coverage with ultrasmall gold nanoparticles
will likely be much greater, and so there may actually be similar
numbers of gold atoms than with larger, but fewer, gold nanoparticles.
Indeed, XRF does have the sensitivity to measure 2 nm gold nanoparticles
linked to antibodies in ppm concentrations.23

We then measured the specificity of our probe to be ∼90%,
comparable to a standard QFISH probe. In fact, it is not surprising
that the specificity of our probe is good, as the PNA part is identical
to a conventional QFISH probe, which has proven excellent specificity.10 However, there is always the possibility of
nonspecific interactions between DNA and gold nanoparticles. However,
we believe the stringent washes (65 °C in 0.2% detergent) we
performed after hybridization (see the FISH protocol) satisfactorily
removed almost all nonspecifically bound probe.

We then used
the Alexa647 part of the probe to measure telomeres
using super resolution microscopy, which unlike diffraction-limited
microscopy gives realistic dimensions. The following discussion describes
how even with very large differences in telomere lengths, super resolution
actually has relatively poor sensitivity in measuring these differences
as a volume or diameter. This means that caution should be used interpreting
results measuring compact vs decompact or long vs short telomere regions.

There are very few studies to date where super resolution techniques
have been applied to telomeres.4,5,24 However, currently there is particular interest in measuring telomere
biophysical properties, as there is controversy about whether DNA
compaction influences the molecular interaction between enzyme complexes
and telomeric DNA, and in particular, how to interpret the effect
of shelterin.

Bandaria et al.4 recently
measured the
volumes of telomeres by super resolution microscopy in compact vs
decompact telomeres, using various shelterin complex knockout cell
lines. They proposed that shelterin protects chromosome ends by compacting
the telomeric chromatin, thus preventing DNA damage response enzymes
from entering into the telomeric space. More recently, the opposite
effect was found by Timashev et al.5 and
Vancevska et al.6 who found that telomeric
DNA damage response occurs in the absence of DNA decompaction and
questioned whether shelterin really compacted DNA to any substantial
degree. An important issue in this debate is measuring the packing
density of the telomeres, which our results allow, as we have measured
both the realistic length (using qPCR) and the actual diameter (with
super resolution).

First, it is important to summarize telomere
diameter results from
the literature values and compare them to our values. We found that
HEK cells had an average telomere length of ∼10 kbps, while
they had an average diameter of ∼180 nm and a range between
60 and 300 nm. This in good agreement with literature values that
range between ∼60 and 400 nm, depending on the cell line and
conditions used. In particular, Vancevska et al. showed that HeLa
cells with “long” telomeres (average ∼30 kbps)
had an average diameter of ∼190 nm (range 100–300 nm)
while HeLa cells with “short” telomeres had an average
diameter of ∼130 nm (range 60–200 nm). Timashev et al.,
using the mouse MEF cell line, reported slightly larger values, ranging
from ∼80 to 400 nm with a mean diameter ∼200 nm. (Note:
both these papers report radius rather than diameter). Bandaria et
al. used HeLa cells and report volumes of telomeres, giving an average
diameter of ∼150 nm. Overall, there is very good agreement
with the reported values and our own.

From our telomere diameter
measurements, we can make an estimation
of the DNA spacing or compaction. If we consider DNA as a cylinder,
the volume is defined by the length and radius of a base pair (0.332
nm length, 1 nm radius), so that the volume of 10 kbps is theoretically
1.25 × 104 nm3. The average HEK telomere
volume is actually ∼140 times more than this (sphere with diameter
180 nm or 1.76 × 106 nm3). For a point
of reference, the “average” packing density or spacing
of genomic DNA is ∼120 times more than the theoretical limit
(genomic DNA = ∼3.2 billion base pairs or 3.33 × 109 nm3; volume of a spherical 5.5 μm radius
cell nucleus = 2.94 × 1011 nm3). So we
can estimate that the telomeric DNA is similarly spaced in comparison
with “average” genomic DNA. This is interesting as it
is often assumed that telomeres are much more compact than “average”
DNA, but as we see in the following discussion, even when proteins
are deleted that were thought to have a “compaction”
effect, there is hardly a change in the measured diameters of telomeres.

We also treated HEK cells with a purported telomerase inhibitor,
AZT. We did this to have a direct comparison between “long”
vs “short” telomeres. With qPCR, we measured a significantly
reduced average telomere length of drug treated HEK cells (about 1
kbps: ∼9 kbps drug-treated compared to ∼10 kbps in controls).
This difference could just be seen using super resolution microscopy,
where we measured diameters of individual telomeres with ∼170
nm drug-treated vs ∼180 nm control, although the ranges of
the two samples overlapped considerably.

Similarly, Vancevska
et al. compared the sensitivity of super resolution
microscopy in measuring the difference between “long”
vs “short” telomeres, against a conventional method
(Southern hybridization). Here, they used two different strains of
HeLa cells genetically modified for cells with long or short telomeres.
With southern hybridization there was a clear telomere length difference,
where an average “long” cell had telomeres that were
∼30 kbps, while the average “short” cell had
∼10 kbps. With super resolution, the “short”
cells had a mean telomere radius of ∼68 nm while the “long”
cells had a ∼90 nm, with large overlapping ranges between the
two. So, with a conventional technique there was a clear difference,
while with super resolution it was measurable, but much less pronounced.
Similarly we found that a clear difference in qPCR manifests as only
a very marginal difference with super resolution microscopy (see Figure 5).

The point
is that measuring compact vs decompact, or long vs short
telomere regions, with super resolution is challenging due to the
large range of telomere diameter values, and results should be interpreted
with caution.

The real strength of super resolution lies in
the ability of analyzing
individual telomeres particularly when colocalizing proteins and complexes
within the telomeric space, or visualizing the telomere DNA loop as
Doksani et al.24 achieved.

Conclusions
We have developed and evaluated a dual purpose probe for human
telomeres. We measured the gold signal arising from this probe located
on telomeres inside cell nuclei. We measured approximately 4400 GNPs
per nucleus. This gold content indicates a probe sensitivity of ∼10%,
based on comparisons with qPCR based telomere length measurements.
The low sensitivity is probably due to steric interference of a relatively
large GNP size not gaining full access to the telomeric space. We
then measured the probe specificity to be ∼90%, by comparing
silver enhanced samples (which directly indicate the locations of
gold nanoparticles) to a standard QFISH probe. We then used the fluorescent
part of our GNP-PNA-A647 probe to measure realistic diameters of human
telomeres. Here, we show that the average diameter is about 180 nm
and that the telomeres are rarely circular. This is important as it
relates to the packing density of the DNA and hence how accessible
telomeres are to various modifying enzymes. Further, by comparing
telomeres from drug treated cells that have on average 1 kbps less
DNA in the telomeres, we are able to discuss the sensitivity of super
resolution as a technique compared to conventional methods.

This work has laid the foundation for a probe design that will
be able to simultaneously measure the absolute length and biophysical
dimensions of individual telomeres in human cells. Moreover, the approach
could have wider uses in measuring other important biomolecules inside
cells and tissue. The absolute size of structures and the number of
molecules present are often important parameters for understanding
basic biological processes.

Experimental Methods
Gold Nanoparticle
Probe Construct
Briefly, the GNPs
are ∼10 nm in size, coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminated
with NH moieties (see the manufacturer’s Web site for physical
characteristics). The probe is an antisense 18-mer peptide nucleic
acid corresponding to the telomeric repeat on the chromosomes of (GGGTAA),
with a spacer molecule and lysine residue at both ends, and an Alexa-647
molecule at the NH terminus end (we call it PNA-A647). The GNPs are
mixed with the PNA-A647 in a molar ratio of 1:100, respectively, left
to react for 2 h, centrifuged at 17 000g and
washed three times to remove any unbound PNA-A647 (details can be
found in the Supporting Information). Absorbance
spectroscopy of the GNP-PNA-A647 conjugate shows two clear peaks at
∼520 nm and ∼655 nm associated with absorption from
the GNPs and the Alexa-647 dye, respectively, indicating the PNA-A674
has bound to the GNPs (see the Supporting Information).

Cell Culture
The HEK-293 cells were a gift from Dr.
Mark Russell (University of Exeter). The cells originated from ATCC
cell culture bank and were grown according to standard protocols.
They were incubated at 37 °C in EMEM media with 10% FBS and passaged
every 2–3 days. We avoided the use of antibiotics.

Metaphase Spread
Protocol
Cells were grown to ∼70%
confluence in T75 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.K.) flasks, yielding
∼1 × 107 cells. Next, the metaphase-blocking
drug KaryoMax colcemid solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.K.) was
added at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/mL and incubated with
the cells for 4 h. The cells were harvested by incubating with trypsin
and then centrifuged at 300g for 5 min to pellet
the cells. After aspirating the trypsin, 5 mL of 0.068 M KCl was added
in drops to resuspend the pellet, mixing gently with each drop. After
leaving the solution at room temperature for 15 min, 0.5 mL of ice-cold
fixative (three parts absolute methanol to one part glacial acetic
acid) was added. After a further centrifugation step and aspiration
of the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in 5 mL of the fixative
and stored at −20 °C.

We used two different substrates
to drop the cells onto; we used a silcon nitride (SiN) window (Silson
Ltd., U.K.) for cell nuclei intended to be analyzed by XRF, while
we used glass coverslip slides for those analyzed by dSTORM. Silicon
nitride is a good substrate for XRF as it contains no trace element
impurities. However, SiN windows are expensive and fragile so processing
cells on them with multiple washing and viewing is technically difficult
as they have a tendency to break.

To obtain good quality metaphase
spreads, cells were “dropped”
from a pipet (each drop contains about 20 μL) from a height
of about 2 cm, onto a substrate (SiN window or coverslip slide) placed
at a 45-degree angle. We did this over a water bath to maintain a
high humidity environment to prevent the chromosomes from drying too
quickly.

Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization Protocol
We processed the metaphase spreads we had prepared on either coverslip
slides or SiN windows using the DAKO (DAKO Ltd., Denmark) FISH telomere
kit (code K5236). This kit provides all key reagents needed for performing
fluorescence in situ hybridization for detection
of telomere sequences by fluorescence microscopy. The metaphase spreads
are first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 2 washes with Tris Buffered
Saline (TBS), pH 7.5, a pretreatment solution of proteolytic enzyme
(proteinase K) is left on the samples for 10 min to remove all the
proteins. After further washes in TBS and dehydration in ethanol,
10 μL of the GNP-PNA-A647 probe (stock solution diluted 1:100)
was added to the sample. The samples were then placed in an oven at
80 °C for 5 min under a coverslip, to denature the DNA in the
presence of the probe. Next the samples were placed in the dark at
room temperature (RT) for 30 min to allow hybridization to take place.

The hybridization was followed by a brief rinse with a Rinse Solution
(proprietary solution, DAKO kit), and a posthybridization wash with
a Wash Solution (0.1% triton-X in TBS) at 65 °C for 5 min. Following
this, the samples were dehydrated in ethanol and left to air-dry.

Assessment of Telomere Length by qPCR
DNA was extracted
from HEK-293 cells using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen/Thermo
Fisher, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA
quality and concentration was checked by Nanodrop spectrophotometry
(NanoDrop/Thermo Fisher, MA). Telomere length was determined using
a modified qPCR protocol.17 PCR reactions
contained 1 μL of EvaGreen (Solis Biodyne, Tartu, Estonia),
2 μM each primer, and 25 ng of DNA in a total volume of 5 μL.
The quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction telomere assay
was run on the StepOne Plus, cycling conditions were a single cycle
of 95 °C for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10
s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A standard curve
is established by dilution of known quantities of a synthesized 84
oligonucleotide containing only TTAGGG repeats. Using the standard
curve method, cycle threshold values were plotted on the standard
curve to estimate a concentration value for telomere DNA repeat sequences.
The average telomere length was calculated as the ratio of telomere
repeat copy number to a single gene (36B4) copy number.

X-ray Fluorescence
The Diamond Light source beamline
uses a pair of KirkPatrick-Baez focusing mirrors to deliver a tunable
size beam to the sample, in our case it was approximately 2.5 ×
2.5 μm2. A silicon drift detector was used at 45°
geometry to collect the characteristic photons from the elements in
the sample. The excitation energy was set at 12.5 keV.

Super Resolution
Microscope
The super resolution images
were taken using a custom-made microscope. The methodology used to
take images and process the data have been published previously.18 The coverslips were fixed to a custom-made chamber
such that the nuclei could be covered with an oxygen-scavenging solution
(0.03 M MEA [mercaptoethylamine]) in glycerol buffered with 1×
PBS (phosphate buffered saline), optimized for A647 photoswitching.
Images were acquired on a commercial Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope
with a Nikon 60×, 1.49 NA oil-immersion TIRF objective (Nikon),
and an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor Technology). Cell nuclei
were found using the DAPI signal from stained chromosomes using 405
nm illumination from an LED light source. The A647 dye bound to the
telomeres on the ends of the chromosomes was illuminated with a 645
nm LED, combined with a Cy5 filter cube (Semrock, 655/40). A region
of interest (ROI) was imaged first with LED illumination and then
in super resolution mode. For dSTORM, illumination was by a 642 nm
laser (Omicron, LuxX 642-140) providing approximately 100 W/m2 focal plane intensity with a spot size diameter of about
40 μm. Cells were illuminated at high intensity for ∼5
s to push a large proportion of the dye molecules into a dark state,
whereupon frames were recorded at 50 ms intervals with custom software
detecting single molecule events in real time. We collected approximately
20 000 events per ROI.

Images were reconstructed using
custom software, written in Python.18 Briefly,
each event was processed using a “jittered triangulation”
algorithm, which essentially produces a 64 bit matrix (and thus an
image), where the value of each event is weighted in comparison to
the closeness of its neighbor.

Image Analysis
Each super resolution
image was saved
as a TIF file and was further processed in MATLAB. The image analysis
code and example images can be found on github.com/charliejeynes. Briefly, each image is binarized using an Otsu threshold. Then
the binarized LED image is compared to the binarized super resolution
image, so that only dots that register in the same place in both images
(i.e., are truly telomeres and not background dots) are counted. Next,
each telomere region is then measured with a number of parameters
including area, perimeter, and equivalent diameter. Throughout the
paper we use equivalent diameter as it normalizes the often-irregular
shapes of the telomeres. The equivalent diameter is calculated as
the √(4 × area/π).

Merged LED and super resolution
images shown in Figure 3 were made from the DAPI (blue) channel for the chromosomes and the
A647 (red channel) for the telomeres. Image analysis of the gold nanoparticle
organic shells shown in Figure 1 followed a very similar image analysis pipeline to that described
above for the super resolution images.
