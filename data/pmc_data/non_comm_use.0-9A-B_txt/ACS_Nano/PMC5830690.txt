A binary ligand system
composed of aliphatic carboxylic acids and
primary amines of various chain lengths is commonly employed in diverse
synthesis methods for CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs). In this
work, we have carried out a systematic study examining how the concentration
of ligands (oleylamine and oleic acid) and the resulting acidity (or
basicity) affects the hot-injection synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs. We devise a general synthesis scheme for cesium lead bromide
NCs which allows control over size, size distribution, shape, and
phase (CsPbBr3 or Cs4PbBr6) by combining
key insights on the acid–base interactions that rule this ligand
system. Furthermore, our findings shed light upon the solubility of
PbBr2 in this binary ligand system, and plausible mechanisms
are suggested in order to understand the ligand-mediated phase control
and structural stability of CsPbBr3 NCs.

Lead halide
perovskites (LHPs),
with the formula APbX3 (A = CH3NH3, Cs etc; X = Cl, Br, I), have been extensively researched over the
past decade as active absorber materials for solar cells, with efficiencies
now exceeding 22.1%.1−3 Following the striking performances of thin-film
LHPs, CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by Protesescu et al.(4) These CsPbX3 NCs possess bright and easily tunable luminescence over the entire
visible range, which makes them excellent candidates for photonic
sources.4−6 With respect to the traditional semiconductors that
are typically used in these applications, LHPs offer potentially lower
manufacturing costs by relying on solution-based processes.7 However, still little is known about the underlying
mechanisms that rule their formation, even though they are the key
to improving quality standards and to the development of commercial
formulations.8−12

Generally, LHP thin films, powders, and NCs are fabricated
by precipitation
reactions in aprotic solvents. In particular, the synthesis of NCs
is conducted in a nonpolar solvent and often in the presence of a
binary ligand system composed of aliphatic carboxylic acids and primary
amines of various chain lengths.4,13 In the common hot-injection
synthesis of cube-shaped CsPbBr3 NCs,4 Cs-oleate is injected into a hot solution (190 °C)
of PbBr2, oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OlAm), and 1-octadecene
(ODE). Although this approach leads to strongly luminescent NCs, reports
have also indicated a fast defocusing of the size distribution within
a few seconds from the injection,14 making
it difficult to obtain samples with standard deviations below 15%,
which are highly desirable for both device fabrication and fundamental
studies. Moreover, size control was limited (8–12 nm) by the
narrow workable temperature range, which was bound by the precipitation
of PbBr2 at ca. 195 °C and by the coformation of nanoplatelets
(NPLs) below 150 °C.4,8,15 Furthermore, accurate shape and thickness control of NPLs is yet
to be achieved using the hot-injection method.8,15 In
this regard, a clearer understanding of the factors that regulate
the formation of NPLs is needed in order to improve their quality.
So far, their formation has not only been correlated to low temperatures15 but also to the presence of short alkylamines8 and high concentrations of alkylammonium ions,16,17 but there is no clear consensus on what the key driving factor is.

In this work, we demonstrate how the acid–base chemistry
of the OlAm/OA binary ligand system is central to the size, shape,
and phase control of cesium lead bromide NCs synthesized via the hot-injection method. We have found that increasing the concentration
of ligands promotes Ostwald ripening but also allows the precipitation
temperature of PbBr2 to rise above 195 °C and to enable
the synthesis of NCs in a temperature range (above 195 °C) that
has hardly been explored to date. Furthermore, we confirmed that mixtures
of oleic acid and oleylamine in a nonpolar medium lead to the protonation
of oleylamine by oleic acid. Oleylammonium-rich synthetic conditions
promoted anisotropic growth through a competition between oleylammonium
and Cs+ ions. The concentration of oleylammonium (RNH3+) could be increased not only by raising the concentration
of oleic acid but also by lowering the temperature. By combining these
key insights, we were able to prepare nanocubes from 4.0 nm (strongly
quantum confined) to 16.4 nm (a range which is significantly wider
than the 8–12 nm obtained by the standard approach4), with size distributions in the range of 8 to
15%. Larger sizes were also accessible, at the expense of a broader
size distribution. Similarly, we could synthesize NPLs with controlled
thicknesses, down to a single monolayer sheet with a (RNH3)2PbBr4 composition. The phase of the NCs could
be switched from CsPbBr3 to the so-called zero-dimensional
Cs4PbBr6, when working above a threshold concentration
of ligands. This is explained in terms of the high solubility of PbBr2 at high concentration of ligands, which shifts the 4CsPbBr3 ↔ Cs4PbBr6 + 3PbBr2 equilibrium to the right. Finally, many of these findings could
be successfully extended to the Cl and I systems.

Size, Shape,
and Phase Control of Cesium Lead Bromide NCs
In this section,
we will address the synthesis of NCs, specifically
the acid–base conditions which enable control over size, shape,
and phase. Mechanistic considerations will be discussed in the following
sections. The CsPbBr3 NCs reported in this work were all
synthesized based on the method reported by Protesescu et
al.,4 and the size and shape control
was obtained by only altering the reaction temperature and the concentrations
of OA, OlAm, and Cs+. In short, 72 mg of PbBr2 (0.20 mmol, 33 mM) were dissolved in a 6.0 mL mixture of various
concentrations of ligands (OlAm and OA) and solvent (ODE). After the
PbBr2 was dissolved at 100 °C under vacuum, the mixture
was heated under nitrogen to the target reaction temperature, at which
point 0.5 mL of a warm Cs-oleate solution was injected. This resulted
in an instantaneous nucleation burst. Thereafter, samples were immediately
cooled to room temperature with an ice bath and separated by centrifugation
(see the Methods for additional details).

It is important to note that PbBr2 is highly soluble
in the binary ligand mixture (OlAm + OA) but not in OA or OlAm alone
(as will be further discussed later). Under the conditions that are
proposed by Protesescu et al. ([OA] = [OlAm] = 0.25
M), PbBr2 precipitates when it is heated to a threshold
temperature of 195 °C (XRD pattern shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, SI).4 By increasing the amount of ligands, we found that this
precipitation temperature can be increased up to 290 °C, as shown
in Figure 1, which
allows for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs even at high temperatures.
Furthermore, we found that keeping the concentration of ligands close
to the minimum amount needed to solubilize the PbBr2 enabled
the synthesis of nanocubes with narrow size distributions (Figure 2a).

Examples of NCs that we could
synthesize with our general scheme
are reported in Figure 2: 4.0 to 7.6 nm cubes (σ = 8–13%) were prepared at 120–150
°C in the presence of 0.25 M OlAm and 25 mM OA. Larger cubes
were obtained by increasing the reaction temperature, which also required
increasing the concentration of ligands. For instance, 16.4 nm cubes
(σ = 15%) were obtained at 220 °C. Syntheses carried out
at 240 °C ([OlAm] = [OA] = 1.5 M) delivered even larger nanocubes
(beyond 100 nm), but they had a very broad size distribution (see
Table 1 and Figure S2 of the SI). All nanocubes
synthesized with our approach had crystal structures that matched
the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 phase (Figure 2d), narrow photoluminescence (PL) peaks (full-widths
at half-maximum of 70–100 meV for weakly confined samples,
140–170 meV for strongly confined samples, which is in agreement
with other reports),4,18 and high PL quantum yields (Table 1).

upon injection of 0.5 mL of Cs-oleate (0.15 M, in 1-ocatadecene) except
the >100 nm sample where 2 mL of Cs-precursor was used and the
growth
time was increased to 60 s.

Our strategy of synthesizing CsPbBr3 nanocubes by using
the minimum amount of ligands needed to solubilize PbBr2 also suppressed Ostwald ripening, which normally leads to the fast
defocusing of NC size within seconds after the injection of Cs+. The suppression of Ostwald ripening was clear, since nearly
monodisperse NCs could even be obtained when the reaction was allowed
to cool without an ice bath, i.e., solely by removing
the heating mantle, a procedure that normally requires at least 10
min for the flask to cool down (see Figure 2f). Furthermore, under such reduced concentrations
of ligands, the formation of nanoplatelets was never observed, regardless
of the reaction temperature. Rather, the amount of NPLs increased
when the concentration of oleic acid in the reaction mixture was increased
(see Figure S3). Following this observation,
pure, square-shaped (ca. 10 × 10 nm, 2.4 nm thick) CsPbBr3 NPLs were prepared at 140 °C by increasing the concentration
of oleic acid in the reaction mixture (from 25 mM to 0.5 M) as well
as in the injection solution (see Figure S4). The thickness of the NPLs could be reduced by decreasing the amount
of Cs+ injected (while keeping the amount of OA constant,
see Table S2), as is evidenced by the absorbance
and PL spectra of the samples (Figure 2b,c, bottom 3). Similar to the findings in previous
reports,17,19 the NPLs exhibited narrow PL peaks (Figure 2c) and their structural
anisotropy was evidenced by strong (hk0) reflections
in their XRD patterns (Figure 2d; see Figure S5 for a representative
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image).

Interestingly,
when Cs+ ions were not included in the
injection solution, a white precipitate formed upon cooling. This
precipitate consisted of micron-sized nanosheets whose crystal phase
could be assigned to that of a hybrid organic–inorganic two-dimensional
perovskite slab with the formula (RNH3)2PbBr4, in which RNH3 denotes the oleylammonium ion (the
corresponding XRD pattern is the first one from the bottom in Figure 2d). Its PL spectrum
(Figure 2c, bottom
row) is characterized by a peak at 3.09 eV, with a long tail to lower
energies, which is in agreement with previous reports for two-dimensional
perovskites.20,21

We have also observed that
by increasing the concentrations of
both oleic acid and oleylamine in the reaction mixture, we could synthesize
NCs in the lead-poor hexagonal Cs4PbBr6 phase
(Figure 3c–e),
which is a nonluminescent insulator characterized by a strong and
narrow absorption band resembling that of individual [PbBr6]4– clusters (Figure 3a,b).22,100 A similar result was
observed by treating CsPbBr3 NCs with an excess of these
same ligands (OA and OlAm), as their phase changed to Cs4PbBr6. In this case, 8 nm cube-shaped CsPbBr3 NCs could be transformed to ca. 20 nm hexagonal Cs4PbBr6 NCs. This increase in NC size is in agreement with the two-step
dissolution–recrystallization mechanism that is reported in
previous works.23,24 Interestingly, the rate of this
transformation was found to be dictated by the ratio between OA and
OlAm and will be discussed in the next section.

concentration of OlAm (0.4 M) and various concentrations of OA and
solvent (hexane). This transformation was followed by spectroscopy
analysis, and the transformation rate was found to be modulated by
the [OA]/[OlAm] ratio, as shown in the figure above. For the sake

Discussion
Acid–base
Equilibrium
This section discusses
the acid–base chemistry of OlAm and OA mixtures in nonpolar
solvents and how the size, shape, and phase control of cesium lead
bromide NCs are regulated. It is known that, in aprotic solvents,
partially substituted nitrogen bases and carboxylic acids can form
hydrogen bonded ionic salts.25 The first
hint of the formation of ammonium carboxylate salts can be observed
by simply mixing OlAm (base, B) and OA (AH) in a 1:1 molar ratio at
room temperature. This generates heat and leads to the formation of
a gel (Figure 4a),
indicating that the ions mainly associate in their salt form under
these conditions. 1  To confirm
the formation of this ammonium
carboxylate, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed
on OlAm and OA mixtures in toluene-d8 (Figure 4c). In the presence
of an excess of OA, the α-CH2 resonances of OlAm
(19) exhibit a downfield shift in the 1H NMR spectrum,
which occurs as a consequence of the nitrogen protonation, while the
α-CH2 resonances of OA (2) show a downfield shift
with the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid (Figure 4b). Opposite shifts are observed in the 13C NMR spectrum; i.e., upfield shifts occur
for the α-CH2 carbon of both the OlAm and the OA
as a result of the protonation of the adjacent functional group (Figure S7.2). In the SI, section S6, we report the complete assignment of the components
in a model mixture of 0.5 M OlAm and 1 M OA in toluene-d8. The α-CH2 resonances of OlAm (19)
and those of OA (2) were unambiguously identified by the 1H–13C-HMBC NMR spectrum (Figure S6.1d).

oleate salt. (b) Structure of oleylamine (OlAm) and oleic acid (OA).
(c) Selected regions of the 1H NMR spectra of OlAm and
OA solutions in toluene-d8. (d) 1H NMR spectra of a mixture of OlAm and OA in toluene-d8, recorded at different temperatures in the range of
27 to 80 °C (upfield shifts are observed for the α-CH21H NMR resonances 19 and 2, while all the other
signals, e.g., 8, 11, 26, and 29, remain unchanged).
All resonances identified are in agreement with previous works.31,32

As previously mentioned, the formation
of the ammonium carboxylate
is exothermic, which implies, on the basis of Le Chatelier’s
principle, that the equilibrium will shift toward the reactants when
the temperature is increased. This was also confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Notably, the α-CH21H NMR resonances of the protonated OlAm (19) and those of OA (2)
shifted upfield when the temperature was increased, which confirms
the deprotonation of the oleylammonium ions and the protonation of
the carboxylic acid (Figure 4d). These facts have important implications in the colloidal
synthesis and phase stability of CsPbBr3 NCs, as will be
outlined in the next section.

Role of Ligands in Size
and Shape Control
First, we
re-emphasize the fact that both ligands are necessary to solubilize
solid PbBr2, which highlights the active role of both the
ammonium and carboxylate species in this process. In this system,
PbBr2 exhibits an inverse solubility behavior (see Figure 1) that is related
to the decrease in the concentration of ammonium and carboxylate species
when the temperature is increased, as has been previously demonstrated.
In addition, we found that this binary ligand mixture can also dissolve
CsPbBr3 NCs (Figure 3f–h). This phenomenon is in agreement with the strong
Ostwald ripening effects that were observed during the NC growth.14 Accordingly, we found that Ostwald ripening
could be suppressed by reducing the concentration of ligands, as is
evidenced by the narrower size distributions of the NCs that were
obtained following our strategy (Figure 2).

Second, it is now well established
that aliphatic ammonium (RNH3+) ions can compete
with Cs+ ions for lattice sites and promote the formation
of hybrid layered structures with the general formula [RNH3]2[CsPbBr3]n−1PbBr4 (in which n denotes the number of PbBr6 octahedra along the thickness).26,27 Indeed, our
results in terms of shape control showed that NPLs could be obtained
by increasing the [RNH3+]/[Cs+] ratio.
Following this concept, and accounting the temperature dependence
of [RNH3+], pure NPL samples could be synthesized
even at high temperatures (190 °C) by simply adjusting the [Cs+] accordingly (see Table S2 and Figure S7). Moreover, such two-dimensional hybrid systems could also
be synthesized in the presence of other Brønsted acids. Notably,
when the acid strength increased (benzylsulfonic ≫ hexanoic
> oleic acid), lower amounts of acid were needed to begin forming
such structures (Figure S8).

Mechanistic
Insights
The solubility of PbBr2 in this system
can be interpreted on the basis of the dissociation
of the oleylammonium oleate salt followed by the solvation of PbBr2. In addition to thermal effects, the dissociation of acid
base salts in aprotic solvents can also occur via homoconjugation 2  a mechanism that typically
shows high equilibrium
constants for amine-based systems.25,28−30

The interpretation of the oleylammonium oleate salt as an
inactive species is supported by our results in terms of phase transformation
(Figure 3f–h).
In short, the transformation of CsPbBr3 into Cs4PbBr6 is driven by the ability of the ligand mixture to
solubilize PbBr2, which is the byproduct of this transformation.
Our results demonstrate that the kinetics of this reaction is modulated
by the relative amounts of acid and base (Figure 3f). The transformation does not proceed in
the absence of acid but is found to be completed in a few minutes
when the amount of acid is ca. 10% mol of that of the amine. However,
increasing the concentration of acid any further slows down the transformation
until it does not proceed again. Therefore, at room temperature, a
1:1 molar mixture of oleylamine and oleic acid, which mainly exist
in salt form, gelates in the absence of a solvent. However, when an
excess of base is present, it can dissociate into ionic species which,
in turn, can dissolve PbBr2 and drive the transformation.

Furthermore, we found that PbBr2 (1 equiv) can be dissolved
at mild temperatures (ca. 80–100 °C) in the presence of
a minimum amount of 0.5 equiv of stearic acid and an excess of amine
ligands (4–5 equiv) (here, octadecylamine and stearic acid
were used due to their high purity), which is likely a result of the
partial dissociation of PbBr2: 3  Note that the
solubility of PbBr2 in polar aprotic solvents increases
in the presence of methylammonium
bromide, and recent computational studies have related this phenomenon
to the formation of PbBr3–methyammonium species
with an increased stability.9

Our
results, in terms of phase control (Figure 3c-e), demonstrate that the NCs tend to crystallize
in the lead-poor Cs4PbBr6 phase when both ligands
are present in large excess. Under such conditions, a full dissociation
of the lead salt into lead oleate and oleylammonium bromide is likely
to occur: 4  

This system allows a greater degree of freedom than the one
described
by eq 2 with respect
to possible outcomes upon the injection of Cs+ ions. For
instance, the reaction of an alkylammonium bromide with Cs+ in the same ligand mixture results in the formation of CsBr NCs
(Figure S9). The two extreme situations
illustrated in eqs 3 and 4 can thus explain our results in terms of ligand-mediated
phase control. Again, given the temperature profile of the acid base-equilibrium,
a system described by eq 4 should shift to the one described by eq 3 when the temperature is increased. Indeed,
we could find a ligand concentration that yields Cs4PbBr6 NCs at low temperatures (165 °C), and CsPbBr3 NCs at high temperatures (220 °C, Figure 2c).

Extension to Other Halide Systems
Most of the findings
reported herein were also found to be valid for the Cl and I systems.
For instance, PbCl2 and PbI2 also exhibit inverse
solubility in this binary ligand system, and the reprecipitation temperatures
follow a similar trend to that found for PbBr2 (see Figure S11). Furthermore, CsPbX3 NCs,
Cs4PbX6 NCs, and (RNH3)2PbX4 nanosheets (X = Cl, I) could also be synthesized
following the same strategies presented here for the phase and shape
control of bromides (see Figures S12 and S13). Unfortunately, for the Cl and I cases, due to the poorer solubility
of PbCl2 and the lower reprecipitation temperature of PbI2 in this binary ligand system, we could not reproduce the
low ligand concentration conditions which had enabled us to synthesize
CsPbBr3 nanocubes with narrow size distributions.

Conclusion
In this work, we have shown how the acid–base interactions
within a ligand system that consists of aliphatic primary amines and
carboxylic acids affect the synthesis and transformation of cesium
lead bromide nanocrystals in nonpolar solvents. This allowed us not
only to achieve precise control over the size, shape, and phase of
the nanocrystals but also to understand the solubility behavior of
PbBr2 in this system. In addition, many of the findings
reported herein were also found to be valid for the Cl and I systems.
Furthermore, one should be able to extend these observations to nonprotic
polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, a commonly used solvent
in the synthesis of lead halide perovskites, which is known to self-decompose
into dimethylamine and formic acid12 and
is able to sustain the growth of perovskite single crystals via inverse solubility. Finally, the fact that this binary
ligand system is able to dissolve CsPbX3 nanocrystals and
cannot provide good surface passivation33 should prompt further studies into other ligand systems.

were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without
any further purification unless otherwise stated.

Preparation
of Cs-Oleate Precursors
Solution 1. Cs-Oleate in 1-Octadecene (Cs2CO3/OA = 26% wt)
Cs2CO3 was weighed
inside a 3-neck round-bottom flask along with oleic acid and 1-octadecene.
The mixture was degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for 2 h in order
to obtain a colorless Cs-oleate solution which was then transferred
into the glovebox. Typically, 407 mg Cs2Co3,
1.55 g OA and 11.7 g ODE were combined to obtain a 0.15 M Cs-oleate
solution.

Solution 2. Cs-Oleate in Oleic Acid
Cs2CO3 was weighed inside a three-neck round-bottom
flask along
with oleic acid (see Table S1 for concentrations).
The mixture was degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for 2 h in order
to obtain a colorless Cs-oleate solution which was then transferred
into the glovebox. Diluted solutions were prepared inside the glovebox
by dilution with degassed oleic acid.

Syntheses (General Considerations)
All synthetic procedures
were undertaken by employing standard Schlenk line techniques assisted
by a nitrogen-filled glovebox where lead(II) bromide and the Cs precursors
were stored. Syntheses were performed in 25 mL 3-neck round-bottom
flasks equipped with a thermocouple and a magnetic stirrer at 800
rpm.

Synthesis of Cube-Shaped CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals (NCs)
All NCs were synthesized in 6.0 mL solutions containing 72 mg of
PbBr2 (0.2 mmol, 33 mM) and various amounts of oleylamine,
oleic acid, and 1-octadecene (see Table 1). Mixtures were degassed for 15 min at 100
°C in order to obtain colorless solutions. Thereafter, the temperature
was ramped to the desired value under a dry nitrogen flow and 0.5
mL of a 0.15 M Cs-oleate solution in 1-octadecene (solution 1, which
had previously been heated for 10 min on a hot-plate set at 200 °C)
was swiftly injected. Unless otherwise stated, the solutions were
immediately cooled after injection with an ice bath and diluted with
5 mL of toluene. The dispersions were centrifuged at 2500 rpm (for
3 min) and the NCs were redispersed in 2.0 mL of hexane. 4.0 and 4.8
nm nanocubes could not be separated by centrifugation alone (even
at 14 krpm). In both these cases, 1 mL of oleic acid was added to
the dispersion (to assist the precipitation process) and the particles
were then precipitated by adding methyl acetate until the solution
became slightly turbid. The NCs were separated by the same centrifugation
and redispersion steps. NCs smaller than 4.0 nm could also be synthesized
(at temperatures under 120 °C), but they could not be isolated
from solution by centrifugation alone, and the addition of antisolvents
led to the formation of nanowires (see Figure S10).

Synthesis of Two-Dimensional [RNH3]2[CsPbBr3]n−1PbBr4 Nanocrystals
The general procedure consisted
in performing the nanocube synthesis
under a high concentration of oleylammonium species ([OlAm] = 0.25
M and [OA] = 0.50 M) and varying the concentration of Cs+ (the smaller the [Cs+], the thinner the crystals). Note
that in this case the injection solution consisted of 0.5 mL of a
solution of Cs-oleate in oleic acid (solution 2, 0 ≤ [Cs+] ≤ 300 mM) and that the growth times ranged from 1
to 5 min; a complete description of the reaction conditions is provided
in Table S1 of the SI. Also note that the
1.7 nm thick nanoplatelets (NPLs) tend to transform into 2.3 nm thick
NPLs upon dilution, which did not allow us to investigate their photoluminescence
quantum yields.

CsPbBr3 to Cs4PbBr6 Transformation
Reactions
100 μL of a nanocube dispersion ([Pb] = 13
mM, as measured by ICP) was injected into a stirring hexane solution
containing oleylamine (0.4 M) and oleic acid (of various concentrations)
with a total volume of 1.0 mL. Aliquots were collected over time in
hexane in order to follow their transformation spectroscopically.
The transformed NCs were separated by centrifugation and redispersed
in hexane or toluene for further analysis.

Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical
Emission Spectroscopy
(ICP–OES)
The concentration of NC dispersions in Pb
was determined by ICP-OES on a aiCAP 6000 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
The NC solutions were digested in aqua regia overnight prior to the
measurements.

X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Samples
were prepared by drop-casting
concentrated dispersions onto a zero diffraction silicon substrate.
XRD measurements were conducted on a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer
equipped with a 1.8 kW Cu Kα ceramic X-ray tube and PIXcel3D
2 × 2 area detector, operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. The diffraction
patterns were collected in air at room temperature using parallel-beam
(PB) geometry and symmetric reflection mode. Due to preferential orientation,
the diffraction pattern of the (RNH3)2PbBr4 nanosheets was collected using an in-plane geometry on a
Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW with the X-ray source operated at 40 kV and 150
mA.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Bright field
TEM images were acquired on a JEOL JEM-1011 microscope (W filament)
operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. For this purpose,
samples were prepared by drop-casting dispersions on carbon-coated
200 mesh copper grids. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and high-angle
annular dark field scanning (HAADF) images were acquired on a JEOL
JEM-2200FS microscope, operating at 200 kV. The microscope is equipped
with a CEOS objective corrector, allowing a resolution below 0.9 Å,
and an in-column filter (Ω-type), which was used to increase
the contrast in the images by filtering around the elastically transmitted
electrons. To obtain a top-view and side-view of the NCs, the samples
were drop-cast on ultrathin carbon on holey carbon coated 400 mesh
copper grids.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
All spectra
were acquired
on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a Broad
Band Inverse probe (BBI). Before each acquisition, automatic routines
optimized the matching, tuning, resolution and 90 deg pulse calculation
on 1H nucleus.

1H NMR: 16 transients were
accumulated, without steady state scans, at 300 K, over a spectral
width of 20.55 ppm (offset at 6.175 ppm), at a fixed receiver gain
(64), using 30 s of inter pulse delays.

1H NMR at
different temperatures (from 300 to 353 K):
16 transients were accumulated, with 4 steady state scans, over a
spectral width of 20.55 ppm (offset at 6.175 ppm), at a fixed receiver
gain (64), using 2.5 s of relaxation delay.

13C NMR:
10240 transients were accumulated after a 30
degree pulse and 4 steady state scans, at 300 K, over a spectral width
of 239 ppm (offset at 100 ppm), using 2.2 s of inter pulse delays.
The receiver was automatically optimized.

All NMR chemicals
shifts were referred to the not deuterated toluene
residue peak at 7.09 ppm and 129.24 ppm at 1H- and 13C-NMR, respectively.

Steady-State UV–vis
Extinction and Photoluminescence
Spectroscopy
Optical extinction and photoluminescence spectra
of hexane dispersions were recorded in quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm
path-length, employing a Varian Cary 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer
and a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively.

Photoluminescence Quantum Yields and Time-Correlated Single-Photon
Counting
The time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were
measured using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorometer.
The PL decay traces were recorded by exciting the samples at 405 nm
using a 50 ps laser diode. The data were collected at the PL peak
position with an emission bandwidth of 10 nm. The photoluminescence
quantum efficiencies were measured using the same instrument with
an integrating sphere, exciting the nanocrystal solution at 400 nm.
The optical density of the nanocrystal solution was 0.1 at 400 nm.
