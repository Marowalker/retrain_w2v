Multidrug resistance in pathogenic bacteria is an increasing
problem in patient care and public health. Molecular nanomachines
(MNMs) have the ability to open cell membranes using nanomechanical
action. We hypothesized that MNMs could be used as antibacterial agents
by drilling into bacterial cell walls and increasing susceptibility
of drug-resistant bacteria to recently ineffective antibiotics. We
exposed extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae to light-activated MNMs and found that MNMs increase the susceptibility
to Meropenem. MNMs with Meropenem can effectively kill K. pneumoniae that are considered Meropenem-resistant.
We examined the mechanisms of MNM action using permeability assays
and transmission electron microscopy, finding that MNMs disrupt the
cell wall of extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae, exposing the bacteria to Meropenem. These observations suggest
that MNMs could be used to make conventional antibiotics more efficacious
against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.

Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens
are an increasing problem worldwide. Annually, 700 000 deaths
are attributed to MDR and antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) strains of
common bacterial infections. This number, if current trends in the
use of antibiotics continue, is projected to increase beyond 10 million
annual deaths by 2050.1 MDR infections
create an increasingly large burden in healthcare and preventative
practices.2 In their 2013 antibiotic-resistant
threat report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
listed 18 MDR and AMR pathogens that require immediate attention.
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were identified as one
of three pathogens at the highest threat level, demanding urgent action.3 Recognizing the global impact of MDR and AMR
pathogens on patient care, the World Health Organization (WHO) put
forth a Global Action Plan (GAP) in 2015 to ensure continued success
in effective treatment and prevention of these infectious diseases.4 In 2017, the WHO also identified CRE as one of
three carbapenem-resistant pathogens in their highest priority category
(Priority 1: Critical) for research and development of new antibiotics,
again highlighting the urgent need for solutions to counter pathogens
resistant to last resort antibiotics.5

Klebsiella pneumoniae belongs to the
family of Enterobacteriaceae and is one of the most important causes
of nosocomial infections worldwide.6 This
Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen colonizes the human intestine
and is of great clinical importance, especially among very sick patients.7K. pneumoniae causes
various healthcare-associated infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream
infections, urinary tract infections, wound or surgical site infections,
and meningitis.8−10 Over the last few decades, MDR K.
pneumoniae infections have rapidly increased in hospital
settings, making first-line antibiotics vastly ineffective. The emergence
of carbapenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae as a major nosocomial infection has raised many concerns as antibiotic
treatment options available against this pathogen are very limited.11−13 With the rapid emergence of resistance to conventional antibiotics
that were once considered wonder drugs, there is an emergent need
for the development of new unconventional antibiotic agents that can
effectively counter MDR pathogens.

Molecular nanomachines (MNMs)
are synthetic organic nanomolecules that have a rotor component with
light-induced actuation (motorization) that rotates unidirectionally
relative to a stator (Figure 1a).14−16 These MNMs can disrupt synthetic lipid bilayers and
cell membranes with their rapid rotational movement. In the absence
of light, MNMs diffuse into bilayers and display little or no toxicity.16−18 The mechanism for light-induced unidirectional rotation of MNMs
can be explained as follows: (1) upon photoexcitation of the central
twisted double bond, it will move into an excited state, wherein the
rotor and stator are orthogonal to each other; (2) normally relaxation
could occur in either direction, but since there is a neighboring
stereogenic center at the methyl group, the two ways that it can rotate
are diastereomeric and therefore different in energy, so relaxation
occurs through the preferred lower energy twist direction that completes
a half turn; (3) the molecule finds itself in a sterically encumbered
twist state, and the rotor and stator will thermally slide past each
other to a lower energy state; (4) then a second photoexcitation followed
by (5) a thermally induced twist puts the molecule back in the original
state.16−18 Recently, ultraviolet-light-activated MNMs were shown
to use nanomechanical action to drill into cell membranes, creating
pores in targeted cancer cells and causing cell death.17 Light-activated fast motor, MNM 1 (Figure 1b), was
shown to cause cell necrosis in human prostate adenocarcinoma cells
(PC-3) and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3). MNMs have various
properties dependent on their steric structure and attached functional
groups. They can be modified to give them specific properties and
functions. Light-activated MNM 1 rotates ∼2–3
million revolutions per second and is considered a fast motor. Light-activated
MNM 2 is a slow motor, rotating only ∼1.8 revolutions
per hour and is a nanomechanical control for MNM 1. MNM 3 is similar to MNM 1 but with a triphenylphosphonium
(TPP) cation attached to its stator portion. TPP targets eukaryotic
mitochondria, causing MNM 3 to accumulate within the
mitochondria.19 MNMs can also have peptide
appendages for specific cell adhesion. Nanomechanical action of fast
motor MNMs makes them potential broad-spectrum antibacterials. We
hypothesized that MNM 1 can disrupt bacterial cell walls
and act as a potent nanomechanical antibacterial agent either alone
or facilitating the action of conventional antimicrobials.

serves as a control. (d) MNM 3 is a fast motor similar
to MNM 1 but with a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation

causing MNM 3 to accumulate within mitochondria. This
served as a control to demonstrate eukaryotic cell targeting of MNMs.

Among various AMR mechanisms used by MDR K. pneumoniae to resist carbapenems, the loss of
cell wall outer membrane porins and production of K.
pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) confer the highest
levels of carbapenem resistance.20−23 The cell wall outer membrane
(OM) lacking porins acts as a mechanical barrier that prevents carbapenem
to permeate the OM and reach its target site, penicillin-binding proteins
(PBP) in the periplasmic space.24 We explore
the use of light-activated MNM 1 nanomechanical properties
to drill pores and disrupt the cell wall in MDR K.
pneumoniae to allow carbapenem to traverse the cell
wall OM and cause bacterial cell death. One of the effective ways
to kill AMR and MDR bacteria is to increase the intracellular concentration
of antibiotics. Biological and chemical approaches have been shown
to modulate metabolic pathways to help increase the effective concentrations
of antibiotics within bacteria.25,26 In this study, we assay
the use of a nanomechnical approach to disrupt the K. pneumoniae cell wall and increase the effective
concentrations of antibiotics.

Here, we use an extensively drug-resistant
(ψkp6) and an antibiotic-sensitive (ψkp7) strain of K. pneumoniae to first show that light-activated
MNM 1 using its nanomechanical action can display antibacterial
properties irrespective of pathogen antibiotic susceptibility profiles.
Then we show that light-activated MNM 1 in combination
with Meropenem has the ability to make an extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae susceptible to Meropenem at subtherapeutic
concentrations. Our results indicate that light-activated MNM 1 uses its nanomechanical action to assist in bypassing the
cell wall OM-induced antibacterial resistance posed by K. pneumoniae. Thus, MNM 1, together
with antibiotics like Meropenem, is shown as a potent antibacterial
agent with the potential to effectively counter the increasing problem
of multidrug resistance not only in K. pneumoniae but also in many other MDR pathogens.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Optimum Conditions for MNM Light Activation
against K. pneumoniae
The
irradiance of the 365 nm light-emitting diode (LED) light source (Sunlite
Eagle 8WFP UV365 LED) used to activate the MNM was within a constant
energy output range of 10.5 to 12 mW/cm2 over 60 min of
exposure, measured at a constant distance (Figure 2a). It had a narrow wavelength spectrum of
360–376 nm, with a peak intensity at 368 nm (Figure 2b). Any bactericidal effects
caused by the heat generated from the light source was controlled
by the used of no MNM and slow MNM controls. Under these conditions,
we assayed the bactericidal effects of the light source on an extensively
drug-resistant K. pneumoniae (ψkp6)
and an antibiotic-sensitive K. pneumoniae (ψkp7). The ψkp6 and ψkp7 antibiotic susceptibilities
were characterized against several antibiotics using microdilution
assays (Table 1). With
5 min of light exposure, we observed a viability reduction of 3% in
ψkp6 and 6.5% in ψkp7. With 10 min of light exposure,
it was 4% in ψkp6 and 18% in ψkp7, and at 60 min, 40%
in ψkp6 and 55% in ψkp7 (Figure 2c). The overall bactericidal effects of 356
nm light on ψkp6 and ψkp7 were not significantly different
(p = 0.1802). Therefore, a 5 min light activation
time was chosen to minimize the effects of 365 nm light on K. pneumoniae. For viability assays, 120–240
μL volumes of bacterial cultures were exposed to light directly
placed above it at a distance of 1.3 cm (Figure 2d). For permeability and toxicity assays,
the light source was directly placed above the 96-well plate at a
distance of 0.65 cm from the culture or media (Figure 2e,f).

Light-Activated MNM 1 Causes Reduced Bacterial
Viability through Its Fast Rotational Movement in K.
pneumoniae
To characterize the antibacterial
properties of MNM 1, we exposed the extensively drug-resistant
(ψkp6) and the antibiotic-sensitive (ψkp7) K. pneumoniae strains to 10 μM of MNM 1 (fast motor), MNM 2 (slow motor) control, and
to the MNM solvent of 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control (no MNM),
with 5 min of 365 nm light activation (Figure 3a). DMSO solvent was used so that the MNMs
remain soluble in media, and DMSO at a concentrations of 0.1% has
no effects on cell viability.17 The only
significant reduction in colony-forming unit (CFU) counts was observed
in light-activated MNM 1 for both ψkp6 and ψkp7
(p = 0.0219 and 0.0078, respectively) (Figure 3b,c). The percent viability
reduction of ψkp6 exposed to light-activated MNM 1 was 21.3%, significantly higher than that of the no MNM (DMSO) control
(5.4%) and MNM 2 control (4.6%) (Figure 3b). Similarly, the percent viability reduction
of ψkp7 exposed to light-activated MNM 1 was 27.2%,
significantly higher than that of the no MNM control (12.9%) and MNM 2 control (12.7%) (Figure 3c). No toxicity or bactericidal effects were observed
when 10 μM of non-light-activated MNM 1 was exposed
to either ψkp6 or ψkp7. These results show that high-speed
rotation of light-activated MNM 1 caused nanomechanical
damage to K. pneumoniae irrespective
of their antibiotic susceptibility, causing a significant relative
reduction in viability (14–17%). In contrast, neither the light-activated
MNM 2 nor the nonactivated MNM 1 caused
a significant reduction in viability. Our results showed no significant
difference in the viability reduction observed in K.
pneumoniae irrespective of their antibiotic sensitivity
profiles. This suggests that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms
of this extensively drug-resistant strain have little or no effect
on the nanomechanical action of light-activated MNM 1.

Light-Activated MNM 1 Causes Cell Wall Inner and
Outer Membrane Disruptions in K. pneumoniae
To confirm that the viability reduction observed in K. pneumoniae is a result of cell wall disruptions
caused by the fast drilling action of light-activated MNM 1, we carried out three assays to characterize the cell wall inner
membrane permeability, outer membrane permeability, and cell membrane
integrity. Cell wall inner membrane permeability of K. pneumoniae exposed to no MNM (DMSO control), 10
μM of MNM 2, or 10 μM of MNM 1 was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, which is a substrate to cytoplasmic β-galactosidase
that would leak through the cell wall inner membrane when disrupted.
In both the extensively drug-resistant (ψkp6) and the antibiotic-sensitive
(ψkp7) K. pneumoniae, light-activated
MNM 1 showed a significant increase in the β-galactosidase
activity, which was represented by an increase in absorbance at a
410 nm wavelength (Figure 4a,b). This was in contrast to both the light-activated MNM 2 and the nonactivated MNM 1 that did not cause
a significant increase in absorbance at 410 nm. To further characterize
these differences, we calculated the differences in β-galactosidase
activity at 30 min postexposure in Miller units.27 In both ψkp6 and ψkp7, light-activated MNM 1 showed a significant increase in inner membrane permeability
compared to that in nonactivated MNM 1, MNM 2, and no MNM (DMSO) control (Figure 4c,d). These results indicate that, upon light activation,
MNM 1 causes nanomechanical damage to the K. pneumoniae cell wall inner membrane, allowing
the leakage of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase enzyme.

We then studied the ability of light-activated
MNM 1 to permeabilize the cell wall outer membrane using
an N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assay.28 In both ψkp6 and ψkp7, light-activated
MNM 1 showed a significant increase in NPN partitioning
to the cell wall outer membrane, which was represented by an increase
in emission at a 430 nm wavelength (Figure 5a,b). This was in contrast to both the light-activated
MNM 2 and the nonactivated MNM 1 that did
not cause a significant increase in emission at 430 nm. These results
indicate that light-activated MNM 1 causes disruptions
in the cell wall outer membrane, allowing the uptake of NPN.

absorbance at 260 nm. Comparison of absorbance at 260 nm of K. pneumoniae after MNM exposure, without (nonactivated)

(d) Antibiotic-sensitive strain of K. pneumoniae (ψkp7). Results presented are means and standard error from

from an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.

To further characterize the extent of the cell
wall damage caused by light-activated MNM 1, we assayed
the leakage of cytoplasmic constituents using absorbance at 260 nm
that detects DNA and RNA in the supernatant.29 Our studies showed that there was no significant difference in absorbance
at 260 nm or relative changes with light-activated MNM 1, MNM 2, or with no MNM control in both the K. pneumoniae strains ψkp6 and ψkp7 (Figure 5c,d). These results
indicate that cell membrane damage caused by light-activated MNM 1 was not large enough to allow the leakage of cytoplasmic
DNA or RNA.

Our K. pneumoniae permeability assays indicate that light-activated MNM 1 is able to damage both the inner and outer membrane of the cell
wall. This allowed smaller molecules such as enzymes and fluorescent
dyes to cross the cell wall but not larger molecules such as DNA or
RNA. The nanomechanical action of MNM 1 was not affected
by antibiotic-resistant mechanisms because it caused cell wall damage
to both K. pneumoniae strains alike.

Light-Activated MNM 1 Combined with Meropenem To
Make an Extensively Drug-Resistant K. pneumoniae More Sensitive to Meropenem
Carbapenems are last resort
antibiotics used in clinical settings against Gram-negative pathogens.
Carbapenem antibiotics cause bactericidal effects through PBPs with
the inhibition of cell wall synthesis.30 Loss of cell wall outer membrane porins is known to contribute to
carbapenem resistance in K. pneumoniae by acting as a physical barrier preventing carbapenem antibiotics
from reaching their target sites in the periplasmic space.31 As light-activated MNM 1 caused
cell wall damage to K. pneumoniae irrespective
of its antibiotic-resistant profile, we hypothesized that MNM 1 will synergize with currently ineffective carbapenem antibiotics
to make them more effective.

To test this hypothesis, we used
light-activated MNM 1 with Meropenem and tetracycline
(control) at subtherapeutic concentrations against the extensively
drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strain
(ψkp6). In contrast to carbapenems, tetracycline antibiotics
are protein synthesis inhibitors that prevent the initiation of translation
by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.32 We assayed Meropenem at concentrations of 0.5 and 4 μg/mL
and tetracycline at 16 and 128 μg/mL. These concentrations were
lower than the MIC and MBC99 against ψkp6 (Table 1). Light-activated
MNM 1 and Meropenem at concentrations of 0.5 and 4 μg/mL
showed significant reduction in ψkp6 viability compared to that
with nonactivated MNM 1 with the same concentrations
of Meropenem (p = 0.0455 and 0.0095, respectively)
(Figure 6a). Light-activated
MNM 1 and tetracycline at concentrations of 16 and 128
μg/mL did not show a significant reduction in ψkp6 viability.

pneumoniae with light-activated MNM 1 with 4 μg/mL Meropenem added 30 min before light activation,
5 min before light activation, or 30 min after light activation. Percent
viability reduction was calculated by comparing light-activated groups
with nonactivated groups. Results presented are means and standard
error from three replicates for each group. The p values are from an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test, compared to no abx group; *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01.

When we used various doses of Meropenem (0.5–64
μg/mL) in combination with 10 μM of light-activated MNM 1 to study the dose-dependent combined effects of the combined
therapy in reducing bacterial viability; as was expected, higher concentrations
of Meropenem alone showed increased reductions in viability, with
16 and 64 μg/mL of Meropenem showing 70 and 98%, respectively
(Figure 6b). Without
light activation, MNM 1 or 2 did not have
any additional viability reduction in K. pneumoniae (Figure 6b). However,
when MNM 1 was light-activated for 5 min in combination
with Meropenem, it caused a significant reduction in bacterial viability
(p < 0.05), shifting the survival curve to the
left (Figure 6b). At
subtherapeutic concentrations of Meropenem (4 μg/mL), light-activated
MNM 1 caused a 41.7% relative reduction in viability,
and at 64 μg/mL of Meropenem, the relative reduction in viability
was 72% (Figure 6c).
These results indicate that Meropenem when combined with light-activated
MNM 1 acts to reduce bacterial viability in an extensively
drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strain
that is otherwise resistant to Meropenem.

To further characterize
the mechanism of interactions between Meropenem and light-activated
MNM 1, we added Meropenem 30 min before, 5 min before,
and 30 min after light activation. Our results show that the presence
of Meropenem during light activation of MNM 1 showed
higher viability reduction in ψkp6 (30 min before, 51.7% and
5 min before, 46.0%), compared to that when added after light activation
(30 min after, 30.7%) (Figure 6d). This suggests that there is a temporal relationship between
Meropenem and light-activated MNM 1, and perhaps the
cell wall damage or perturbation caused by MNM 1 is a
transient effect. Although we characterized the temporal aspect of
the mechanistic relationship between Meropenem and MNM 1, it still needs more careful characterization. However, the MNMs
alone, disrupting cell walls, do result in bacterial death, albeit
slower than in the presence of antibiotics.

Ultrastructural Observations Show Light-Activated MNM 1 and Meropenem Destroy Extensively Drug-Resistant K. pneumoniae
To further confirm the combined
action between light-activated MNM 1 and 4 μg/mL
of Meropenem, we exposed ψkp6 to MNM 1 with and
without Meropenem and light activation and observed under transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 7). The ψkp6 exposed to Meropenem and nonactivated
MNM 1 showed minimal ultrastructural and morphological
changes (Figure 7a–d).
In contrast, ψkp6 exposed to Meropenem with light-activated
MNM 1 showed distinct ultrastructural and morphological
changes, many of which can possibly be attributed to changes with
Meropenem alone (Figure 7e–h).33,34 These observations included cell
wall disruptions (yellow arrowhead), areas of clear cytoplasm (purple
arrowhead), areas of cytoplasmic leakage (red arrowhead), and bacterial
elongation. These observations were quantified in 60–80 ψkp6
per group (Figure 7i,j). Compared to the control groups, ψkp6 exposed to light-activated
MNM 1 and Meropenem showed the presence of significantly
higher cell wall disruptions, cytoplasmic clearance, and cytoplasmic
leakage (p > 0.005) (Figure 7i). The extent of the ultrastructural damage
caused was further quantified as mild, moderate, and extensive. The
light-activated MNM 1 and Meropenem showed a significantly
higher, moderate, and extensive ultrastructural damage in ψkp6
compared to that of the control groups (Figure 7j). These TEM observations confirm our viability
reduction results, in which light-activated MNM 1 made
subtherapeutic concentrations of Meropenem effective against the extensively
drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strain
(ψkp6).

areas of cytoplasmic clearance (p = 0.0002), cytoplasmic
leakage (p < 0.0001), and bacterial elongation
(p = 0.0022). (j) Extent of damage observed in K. pneumoniae categorized as mild, moderate, or extensive

Results presented are the percentage of bacilli number in each exposure
group. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the differences in means
of each group; **p < 0.01.

We used TEM to confirm the combined action of light-activated
MNM 1 with Meropenem and showed that, upon light activation,
the extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae undergoes pathological and morphological changes such as cytoplasmic
clearance and bacterial elongation that are associated with the action
of Meropenem. The significance of this finding is that light-activated
MNM 1 was able to make a subtherapeutic concentration
effective again. To study the mechanism of action between Meropenem
and MNM 1, we examined the temporal effects of Meropenem
addition (Figure 7i).
We show that it is important that Meropenem be present during light
activation of MNM 1, as the cell wall disruptions could
be transient.

Light-Activated MNM 1 Does Not Cause Cytotoxicity
in J774A.1 Macrophage Cells
The use of a broad-spectrum nanomechanical
antibiotic carries with it the concern of nonspecific damage or associated
cytotoxicity to adjacent host cells. To characterize the cytotoxic
effects of light-activated MNM 1 (fast motor) on mammalian
cells, we used J774A.1 macrophages and exposed them to various concentrations
of MNM (0.5–100 μM) and observed them for up to 24 h
postexposure (Figure 8). We assayed 0.1% DMSO (solvent) in media and MNM 2 (slow motor) as negative controls and MNM 3 (fast motor
with TPP, targeting mitochondria) as a positive control for mammalian
cell toxicity to perform lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity
assays (Figure 8).
At 24 h postexposure, percent cytotoxicity observed was as follows:
1% DMSO without light exposure = 1.8% and with light exposure = 4.3%
(Figure 8a); 100 μM
of MNM 1 without light activation = 1.6% and with light
activation = 3.9% (Figure 8b); 100 μM of MNM 2 without light activation
= 3.1% and with light activation = 5.9% (Figure 8c); and 100 μM of MNM 3 without light activation = 76.5% and with light activation = 87.2%
(Figure 8d). There
was no statistical significance between nonactivated MNM 1 and MNM 2 or no MNM (DMSO) control. This shows that
even at a 10× concentration (100 μM) used against K. pneumoniae, MNM 1 does not display
any cytotoxicity in macrophages. However, when exposed to light, both
the no MNM (DMSO) control and MNM 1 showed an increase
in cytotoxicity (p < 0.005), showing the cytotoxic
effects of 365 nm light on mammalian cells.

Figure 8 Cytotoxicity of molecular
nanomachine treatment for J774A.1 macrophages. Percent cytotoxicity
of macrophage cells measured with an LDH assay at 0.5, 4, and 24 h
exposed to 100 μM MNM without or with light activation. Percent
cytotoxicity was calculated using a low control (natural cell death)
(0%) and a high control (Triton-x induced cell death) (100%) (a) without
MNM (1% DMSO) (p = 0.0282), (b) with 100 μM
of MNM 1 (fast motor) in 1% DMSO (p =
0.0428), (c) with 100 μM of MNM 2 (slow motor)
in 1% DMSO (p = 0.1971), (d) with 100 μM of
MNM 3 (fast motor with TPP, targeting mitochondria) in
1% DMSO (p = 0.8748). The DMSO concentration was
1% because 100 μM MNM was assayed. Results presented are mean
and standard error from four replicates; *p <
0.05.

Light-Activated MNM 1 Assists Meropenem in Killing
an Extensively Drug-Resistant K. pneumoniae
Meropenem-resistant K. pneumoniae uses different mechanisms to prevent Meropenem from reaching PBP
within peptidoglycan in the periplasmic space. One such resistant
mechanism is a cell wall outer membrane lacking porins that keep Meropenem
out of the bacteria.24 When MNM 1 is activated with 365 nm light, it rotates unidirectionally at 3
MHz to drill pores into the cell wall of K. pneumoniae through its nanomechanical action. These pores allow Meropenem to
travel across the cell wall outer membrane and reach PBP. This causes
the destruction of the peptidoglycan layer, destabilizing the bacterial
cell wall and leading to the death of K. pneumoniae. This synergistic mechanism between light-activated MNM 1 and Meropenem allows subtherapeutic concentrations of Meropenem
to kill Meropenem-resistant extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae. In the current study, we observed
an approximately 10-fold increase in efficacy using MNM, possibly
due to the extensive resistance mechanisms present in the strain.
Efficacy might be improved by further optimizing concentrations of
MNM and Meropenem used as well as combining this approach with strategies
to block resistance mechanisms, but current data show promise for
use of MNM to improve the utility of conventional antimicrobials.

There are a few limitations in this study. MNM 1 has
a nonspecific action, without any specific binding affinity to K. pneumoniae, and toxicity was examined solely in
a cell line rather than in a whole animal. When MNM 1 was previously used to target and permeabilize cancer cells, they
had short sequence peptides that allowed selective binding and high
cell specificity. Targeting specific bacterial receptors using ligands
can increase the specificity to the pathogen.35 Several ligands including asialo-GM1, asialo-GM2, and GM2 have been
shown to have specificity to K. pneumoniae and can be attached to the MNM stator to increase their specificity
and efficacy.36−38

Another concern of the nonspecific nature of
MNM 1 is the toxicity and possible damage it can cause
to surrounding host cells during light activation. In order to address
this issue, we looked at the cytotoxicity of MNM 1 in
macrophages (Figure 8). We only observed a 1.6% cytotoxicity with 100 μM (10×
more) MNM 1. However, with 365 nm light exposure, the
macrophage cytotoxicity increased to 3.9–5.9% (p < 0.05), highlighting the concerns with this use of 365 nm light.
Similarly, longer exposures display more bacterial toxicity due to
light alone, reducing the observation of the effects of the MNM. This
issue caused us to limit our MNM 1 activation time to
5 min because 365 nm light displayed higher bactericidal effects over
longer exposure times (Figure 2c). We are in the process of developing 405 nm light-activated
MNMs that will be safer and should allow longer activation times without
as much killing due to the light itself.

A wavelength of 365
nm has a relatively low penetration in host organs and tissue. This
currently limits the use of MNMs for the potential treatment of deep
tissue infections, as MNMs will not be activated effectively. We are
also exploring the synthesis of next generation MNMs that are activated
with longer wavelengths (>700 nm) in the near-infrared (NIR) region.
This will greatly increase the ability of MNM activation in much deeper
host targets and also allow the activation of MNM for longer times
to achieve a far superior antimicrobial efficacy, without any associated
harmful effects on the host. However, the energies at these wavelengths
are much lower. We have been exploring two-photon NIR, although the
potential depth may be somewhat limited, this approach would allow
very precise targeting within tissues.18

Our current study characterizes the use of light-activated
MNM 1 as an effective nanomechanical antibacterial agent
against extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae. In addition to its ability to counter antibacterial resistance,
light-activated MNM 1 has several potential therapeutic
applications. It can be used to treat skin infections and wound infections
by direct light activation at the site of infection, and its broad-spectrum
activities make it possible to treat urinary tract infections through
a catheter device for light delivery. Light-activated MNM 1 also has the potential to disrupt biofilms on indwelling prosthetic
devices by direct application of MNM 1 and light activation
at the site of infection. This strategy could allow antibiotic treatment
to be more efficacious against biofilm-forming pathogens.

Conclusions
In this study, we show that light-activated
MNM 1 displays antibacterial properties against K. pneumoniae that is not diminished even in an extensively
drug-resistant strain (Figure 3). This is because bacterial antimicrobial resistance mechanisms
are not developed against a nanomechanical agent that disrupts bacterial
cell walls. We have shown the ability of light-activated MNM 1 to disrupt cell walls by its nanomechanical action, using K. pneumoniae cell wall IM and OM permeability assays
(Figures 4 and 5). The ability to use nanomechanical force to disrupt
bacterial cell walls is a characteristic feature of MNMs with the
potential of many therapeutic applications and has not been characterized
before. With only 5 min of MNM 1 light activation, we
observed 14–17% in viability reduction of K.
pneumoniae. Next, we show that light-activated MNM 1 can combine with Meropenem at subtherapeutic concentrations
to be effective against an extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strain (Figure 6). The ability to help otherwise ineffective
antibiotics to be efficacious is another distinctive aspect of light-activated
MNM 1. The use of MNM 1 in combination with
other conventional antibiotics allows the potential to recycle many
currently available antibiotics against MDR pathogens. We plan to
evaluate MNM 1 in a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
MDR pathogens as well as other antimicrobials to better understand
how broad their utility will be.

Methods
Bacterial Strains
Two clinical strains of K. pneumoniae were used: an extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae, AR-0666 (ψkp6) obtained from
the CDC, and a KPC-negative antibiotic-sensitive strain, NIH-1 (ψkp7)
obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Synthesis of Molecular Machines
The molecular motors 1 and 2 were freshly prepared according to our
previous protocols.17,18 The molecular motor 3 is newly designed and synthesized as described in the Supporting Information.

Molecular Nanomachines
MNM 1 is a fast
motor with a rotor that rotates at (2–3) × 106 revolutions per second relative to its stator (Figure 1b). MNM 2 is a
slow motor that rotates about 1.8 revolutions per hour (Figure 1c). MNM 2 served
as a negative control. MNM 3 is MNM 1 attached
to the TPP cation at the stator (Figure 1d). TPP targets eukaryotic mitochondria and
was used to demonstrate eukaryotic cell targeting of MNMs.

Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal
Concentration (MBC99) of Antibiotics in K. pneumoniae
Log-phase K.
pneumoniae cultures [(4–5) × 105 CFU/mL] grown in Mueller–Hinton broth were exposed to antibiotics
for 16 h in 96-well plates in triplicate. Serial dilutions (1:2) of
each antibiotic were assayed in a microdilution assay against K. pneumoniae. A PerkinElmer EnVision microplate
reader was used to measure culture optical density at 600 nm. After
antibiotic exposure, bacterial cultures were plated for CFL/mL counts.
The MIC and MBC99 values were calculated relative to the
starting CFU/mL. MIC was defined as the minimal concentration of antibiotic
needed to inhibit the growth of the starting culture of bacteria (≤100%).
MBC99 was defined as the minimal concentration of the antibiotic
needed to kill 99% of the starting culture of bacteria (≤1%).

K. pneumoniae Viability Reduction
Assay
Log-phase K. pneumoniae cultures [(2–4) × 105 CFU/mL] grown in Lysogeny
broth were exposed to MNM in triplicate. The concentration of MNMs
used was 10 μM in 0.1% DMSO. K. pneumoniae cultures were incubated with MNMs for 30 min prior to 5 min of 365
nm light activation. The 365 nm light source was placed directly above
the cultures at a constant distance of 1.3 cm (Figure 1d). After light exposure, bacterial cultures
were plated for CFL/mL counts.

Inner Membrane Permeability Assay
K.
pneumoniae [(2–4) × 105 CFU/mL]
was washed once with 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and resuspended
in the same buffer containing 1.5 mM o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside.27 Cultures were incubated
with 10 μM MNMs in a black 96-well plate with clear bottoms
with 100 μL of K. pneumoniae in
four replicates. MNMs were light-activated for 5 min with the light
source placed directly above the 96-well plate (Figure 2e). The production of o-nitrophenol
was monitored at an absorbance of 410 nm every 3 min for 45 min postlight
exposure. Miller calculation was used to determine the inner membrane
permeability.

Outer Membrane Permeability Assay
K.
pneumoniae [(2–4) × 105 CFU/mL,
100 μL] was incubated with 10 μM MNM in a black 96-well
plate with clear bottoms for 30 min and then light-activated for 5
min in four replicates (Figure 2e). After light activation, 10 mM 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine
was mixed and incubated for 30 min. The fluorescence intensity due
to the partitioning of NPN into the OM was measured with a microplate
reader fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength
of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 430 nm.

Cell Membrane Integrity Assay
Similar to the OM permeability
assay, K. pneumoniae was exposed to
MNMs and light-activated for 5 min in four replicates. These cultures
were spun down at 10 000 rpm, and the supernatant was placed
in a 96-well plate. The release of cytoplasmic constituents of the
cell was monitored using the absorbance at 260 nm.29

MNM and Meropenem Combined Assay
Similar to viability
reduction assays, ψkp6 cultures [(2–4) × 105 CFU/mL] were incubated with 10 μM of MNM and Meropenem
for 30 min and activated with 365 nm light for 5 min in triplicate.
Different concentrations of Meropenem (0,5, 4, 16, and 64 μg/mL)
were used with 10 μM of MNM. Tetracycline (16 and 128 μg/mL)
was used as an antibiotic control with MNM. These cultures were then
plated for CFU/mL counts.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Log-phase ψkp6
(5 × 106 CFU/mL) was exposed to 10 μM of MNM 1 and 4 μg/mL of Meropenem with and without light activation
for TEM. The four exposure groups were (a) MNM 1 only,
without light activation; (b) MNM 1 only, with light
activation; (c) MNM 1 with Meropenem, without light activation;
and (d) MNM 1 with Meropenem, with light activation.
Postexposure, K. pneumoniae was incubated
with Meropenem for an additional 2 h. Then the mixture was fixed with
4% formaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 1% acrolein. After three
washes, the mixture was embedded in Epon 812 resin and stained with
5% uranyl acetate. The embedded samples were sectioned into grids
and imaged with a JEOL 1200 TEM. Cell wall disruptions, cytoplasmic
clearance, cytoplasmic leakage, and bacterial elongation were quantified
using 60–80 ψkp6 for each group.

Macrophage Cytotoxic Assay
A LDH cytotoxicity colorimetric
assay kit (Biovision, #K311) was used to measure the cytotoxicity
of MNMs at different concentrations (0.5, 1, 10, 50, and 100 μM)
in a J774A.1 macrophage cell line. J774A.1 cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were incubated with MNMs in a 96-well
plate (100 μL in each well) and exposed to 5 min of 365 nm light
(Figures 2f and 8d). Cytotoxicity of MNMs with and without light
activation was measured at 0.5, 4, and 24 h postexposure. DMSO and
MNM 2 were used as negative controls. MNM 3 was used as a cell-targeted positive control.

Statistical Analyses
All experiments were done with
at least three replicates (n ≥ 3). The number
of replicates used in each experiment is stated in the figure legend
of each experiment. Prism GraphPad was used to perform the two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t test statistical analyses
to compare the means of two exposure groups. For comparison among
three or more groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. A Mann–Whitney
U test was used to compare different survival plots. Means and standard
errors are presented in each of the graphs plotted in Microsoft Excel.
A value of p < 0.05 was defined as statistically
significant.
