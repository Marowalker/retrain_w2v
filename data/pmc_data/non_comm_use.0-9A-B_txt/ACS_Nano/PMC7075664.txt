Tumor
targeting using agents with slow pharmacokinetics represents
a major challenge in nuclear imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy
as they most often result in low imaging contrast and high radiation
dose to healthy tissue. To address this challenge, we developed a
polymer-based targeting agent that can be used for pretargeted imaging
and thus separates tumor accumulation from the imaging step in time.
The developed targeting agent is based on polypeptide-graft-polypeptoid polymers (PeptoBrushes) functionalized with trans-cyclooctene (TCO). The complementary 111In-labeled imaging agent is a 1,2,4,5-tetrazine derivative, which
can react with aforementioned TCO-modified PeptoBrushes in a rapid
bioorthogonal ligation. A high degree of TCO loading (up to 30%) was
achieved, without altering the physicochemical properties of the polymeric
nanoparticle. The highest degree of TCO loading resulted in significantly
increased reaction rates (77-fold enhancement) compared to those with
small molecule TCO moieties when using lipophilic tetrazines. Based
on computer simulations, we hypothesize that this increase is a result
of hydrophobic effects and significant rearrangements within the polymer
framework, in which hydrophobic patches of TCO moieties are formed.
These patches attract lipophilic tetrazines, leading to increased
reaction rates in the bioorthogonal ligation. The most reactive system
was evaluated as a targeting agent for pretargeted imaging in tumor-bearing
mice. After the setup was optimized, sufficient tumor-to-background
ratios were achieved as early as 2 h after administration of the tetrazine
imaging agent, which further improved at 22 h, enabling clear visualization
of CT-26 tumors. These findings show the potential of PeptoBrushes
to be used as a pretargeting agent when an optimized dose of polymer
is used.

The application of nanotechnology
for drug delivery, diagnosis, and targeted radionuclide therapy holds
the potential to improve current strategies in cancer treatment.1 Nanomedicines such as polymers, liposomes, micelles,
and inorganic nanoparticles facilitate accumulation and retention
at tumor sites, thereby toxicity to healthy tissue is reduced substantially.2 The passive accumulation of nanomedicines into
tumors is enabled by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)
effect. This widely discussed phenomenon, which has been shown in
a variety of tumor types, comes as a result of leaky tumor vasculature
and impaired lymphatic drainage.3 Recently,
the clinical relevance of this effect has been demonstrated; for example,
the treatment response of liposomal doxorubicin, a nanomedicine, has
shown a positive correlation with the extent of EPR-mediated tumor
uptake.4−9 Although the EPR effect provides an attractive route to deliver
nanomedicines to solid tumors, it is a highly complex process with
considerable variations among patients with tumors of the same type,
as well as within the same tumor.7,10,11 Factors arising from the physicochemical properties
of the specific nanomedicine (e.g., size, shape,
composition, and surface characteristics) and the tumor microenvironment
(e.g., vascularization and interstitial fluid pressure)
are known to influence the tumor accumulation.2,4−6 Hence, methods that can identify likely responders
to a given nanomedicine from larger patient cohorts are needed. Medical
imaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to assess
the biodistribution and tumor accumulation of a specific radiolabeled
nanomedicine in a patient.2,8,12,13

Current attempts to utilize
radiolabeled nanomedicines for imaging
in the clinic are often challenged by slow pharmacokinetics. As a
result, high target accumulation through the EPR effect and good image
contrast can only be achieved after several days.14 Therefore, to match the biological life of nanomedicines,
long-lived radionuclides are required. This inherently results in
high radiation doses to healthy tissues, which consequently limits
or even prohibits clinical application.15−17 A promising strategy
that can be applied to address these challenges is pretargeting. This
two-step procedure separates the targeting from the imaging step,
thereby facilitating the use of short-lived radionuclides in combination
with slowly accumulating nanomedicines. In pretargeting approaches,
the nanomedicine (primary targeting agent) is first administered intravenously
(i.v.) and allowed to accumulate at its target site over a sufficient
period of time. Second, a rapidly distributing and excreting radiolabeled
probe (secondary imaging agent) is administered and interacts or binds
to the preadministered nanomedicine in vivo (Figure 1).18−20

Figure 1 Illustration of conventional
nuclear imaging compared to pretargeted
nuclear imaging of a tumor targeting nanomedicine using the tetrazine
ligation. Here, the nanomedicine, which acts as the primary targeting
agent, is a polymer modified with trans-cyclooctene
(TCO), and the secondary imaging agent is a radiolabeled 1,2,4,5-tetrazine
(Tz). In conventional nuclear imaging, the nanomedicine is radiolabeled
(yellow box), administered, and allowed to circulate for days to achieve
tumor accumulation and sufficient systemic clearance for imaging (usually
a time frame of 22–72 h). In pretargeted nuclear imaging, the
TCO-modified primary targeting agent (blue box) is administered and
allowed to circulate until tumor accumulation and sufficient systemic
clearance has been achieved. Thereafter, the radiolabeled Tz (pink
box) is administered, imaging is performed within the first few hours
as the bioorthogonal reaction between TCO and Tz, and the excretion
of Tz proceeds rapidly.

Selective reaction between
the secondary imaging agent and the
primary targeting agent at the tumor site can be achieved by the use
of bioorthogonal chemistry.21 At present,
the fastest bioorthogonal reaction is the tetrazine ligation, wherein
a 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Tz) reacts with a dienophile, usually trans-cyclooctene (TCO) (Figure 1).22 This ligation
shows high selectivity and impressive reaction kinetics (rate constants
up to 106 M–1 s–1),
which makes it an exceptionally useful tool for pretargeting strategies.20,23−26

So far, almost all pretargeting studies based on the tetrazine
ligation have used TCO-functionalized monoclonal antibodies (mAb).27−32 As an alternative, biodegradable TCO-functionalized polymers with
dimensions relevant for EPR-mediated tumor accumulation could be used
as the primary targeting agent and may even provide the potential
to increase the TCO content, to better shield TCO moieties or enhance
stability in circulation.33−35 We have recently shown that the
biological half-life of TCO moieties could be prolonged to reasonable
time frames for pretargeted imaging (up to approximately 10 days)
when they are attached in close proximity to the mAb.36 This enhanced in vivo stability was suggested
to be a result of a shielding effect from the mAb toward Cu-containing
serum proteins, which cause isomerization of TCO to its less reactive cis-isomer. As a comparison, the half-life of TCO connected
to a mAb via a PEG10 chain was approximately
two times shorter.37 Designing TCO-functionalized
polymers with a hydrophilic shell and a hydrophobic core may provide
the same shielding effect when TCO moieties are located inside the
hydrophobic core, while still being accessible for tetrazines. For
this purpose, polypeptide-graft-polypeptoid copolymers
based on polyglutamic acid (pGlu)/polysarcosine (pSar) moieties (PeptoBrushes)
appear to be ideal candidates. They can be used to build up core–shell
structures that allow for high loading of lipophilic compounds, such
as TCO moieties, without the risk of aggregation and with the possibility
to shield these moieties against degradation.38−41 Moreover, these types of polymers
are reported to be highly biocompatible (nontoxic and nonimmunogenic)38−40,42 and have previously been used
for EPR-mediated tumor targeting.40,43,44

Herein, we describe the development and evaluation
of TCO-functionalized
PeptoBrushes based on a pGlu backbone and hydrophilic pSar side chains
forming a stealth-like shell around the unimolecular nanoparticle.
The PeptoBrushes were functionalized with different degrees of TCO
moieties in order to study the influence of various TCO loadings on
the performance of the tetrazine ligation. In contrast to micelles,
these graft architectures do not allow for a complete phase separation
between hydrophobic TCO moieties and hydrophilic pSar polymers. Instead,
they form individual hydrophobic patches. These patches may be the
right balance between accessibility and steric shielding to enhance
TCO stability toward enzymes but maintain TCO reactivity toward low
molecular weight Tz imaging agents. Ultimately, we aimed to evaluate
the potential of these PeptoBrushes to be used as primary targeting
agents for pretargeted SPECT imaging. Subsequent experiments were
planned to be carried out in a mouse tumor model CT26 (murine colorectal
cancer) showing a pronounced EPR effect.

Results and Discussion
Design,
Synthesis, and Characterization of TCO-Functionalized
Polypeptide-graft-Polypeptoid Copolymer Brushes (PeptoBrushes)
The applied PeptoBrushes consist of a pGlu backbone to which hydrophobic
TCO moieties and hydrophilic pSar chains are attached, forming a molecular
brush polymer. We hypothesized that this polymer architecture may
improve the reaction kinetics of the tetrazine ligation because the
ligation appears to be controlled by the reaction probability rather
than by diffusion. This was concluded by comparing typical Tz derivative
diffusion constants with typical tetrazine ligation rates in solution.
This observation implies that the rate constant should increase in
the presence of an attractive potential that keeps the reactants close
to each other. This situation is given within PeptoBrushes. The Smoluchowski
theory describes the coagulation/diffusion of small particles in solution
over time.45 It can be used to calculate
the reaction rate increase, which we hypothesize to exist within PeptoBrushes.
Indeed, calculations based on the Smoluchowski theory indicated that
the rate constant of the tetrazine ligation should increase by a factor
of approximately 3 when lipophilic Tz derivatives are reacted with
PeptoBrushes (see Supporting Information (SI)). These preliminary calculations convinced us to synthesize four
different PeptoBrushes with different degrees of TCO loading (0, 7.5,
15, and 30%) and, consequently, evaluate their reaction kinetics experimentally.

Polymers 1–3 were obtained via grafting of TCO moieties and pSar polymers onto a pGlu
acid backbone (Scheme 1).38 The hydrophobic pGlu(OBn) backbone
(6) was synthesized by nucleophilic ring-opening polymerization
of γ-benzyl-l-glutamic acid N-carboxyanhydride
(5), initiated by neopentylamine. After an acidic deprotection
of the benzyl groups of intermediate 6, the pGlu backbone 7 was obtained in a yield of 97%. The chain length of 7 consisted of 100 monomer units, which was determined by
proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR).
The pGlu backbone (7) was then functionalized with various
amounts of TCO moieties via amide coupling of (E)-cyclooct-4-en-1-yl(3-aminopropyl)carbamate (8) to the carboxylic acid groups of 7 for PeptoBrushes 1–3. Purification of the respective polymers
(9–11) was achieved by dialysis and
subsequent lyophilization. We aimed for an incorporation of 7.5, 15,
and 30% TCO moieties to be able to correlate the degree of TCO functionalization
with the reaction rates of the tetrazine ligation. The degree of functionalization
was determined by 1H NMR through quantification of the
alkene protons (5.4–5.8 ppm) against the initiator protons.
PeptoBrushes 1–3 showed a TCO functionalization
of 8, 13, and 30%. Finally, as outlined in Scheme 1, the pSar homopolymer (12)
was prepared using an analogous ring-opening polymerization strategy
as described for pGlu(OBn) (6) but starting from sarcosine N-carboxyanhydride (13).38 The pSar 12 was isolated in a yield of 98%,
and the degree of polymerization (DP) was determined to be 82 and
a dispersity value (Đ) of 1.10 was detected
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP).

TCO moieties are bound to a polymer and located within hydrophobic
TCO patches (yellow), which attract lipophilic Tz derivatives; n = 100, k = pSar grafting density, m = TCO loading (see Table 1).

Thereafter, 12 was grafted onto 7 to
obtain PeptoBrush 4 and onto the remaining carboxylic
acid groups of TCO-functionalized pGlu backbones 9–11 (Figure 2A and SI Figures S1–S3). We aimed
for a maximal incorporation of pSar side chains, which resulted in
an amount of 26% pSar units for PeptoBrush 4 and 24–28%
pSar units for PeptoBrushes 1–3 (Table 1). The resulting PeptoBrushes 1–4 were successfully purified by spin-filtration, lyophilized,
and analyzed via single-angle (zetasizer) and multiangle
dynamic light scattering (DLS), as well as cryogenic transmission
electron microscopy (cryoTEM) (Figure 2B,C and SI Figures S2–S4). Spherical shapes with diameters of 10–11 nm were observed
for all polymers, underlining the formation of single chain polymer
nanoparticles. However, the internal structure could not be visualized
by electron microscopy, likely due to the small size of polymer brushes
in solution. Table 1 displays the characteristics for the synthesized benzyl-protected
pGlu backbone (6), pSar (12), and PeptoBrushes 1–4.

Reaction Kinetics of PeptoBrushes
The reactivity of
the PeptoBrushes 1–3 in the tetrazine
ligation was studied by monitoring the reaction with fluorogenic “turn-on”
Tz derivatives HELIOS 347Me (14) and HELIOS 388Me (15)46 (Figure 3A) in a buffered aqueous environment. Reaction
of 14 and 15 with a dienophile leads to
a significantly increased fluorescence (“turn-on”, Figure 3B), enabling real-time
monitoring of the reaction progress. For comparison, the rate constants
of the reactions of 14 and 15 with the water-soluble
TCO derivative 16(47) were determined.
Kinetic investigations were performed by monitoring reactions in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) by stopped-flow spectrometry (with fluorescence detection).

of the reaction rate of PeptoBrush 1 with the lipophilicity
(C log D7.4 values) of Tz 14, 15, 18,
and 19. C log D7.4 values were calculated using the software
Chemicalize. For Tz 19, M = metal ion.

Measured second-order rate constants for the ligation of
the Tz
derivatives 14 and 15 with PeptoBrushes 1–3 were in the range of 13 000
to 750 000 M–1 s–1 (Figure 3C and SI Table S1). Calculation of the rate constants
per single TCO unit (i.e., TCO moiety) revealed that
the measured reaction rates (per TCO) far exceeded those of the used
TCO control compound 16 when reacting with 14 and 15. The highest rate of >25 000 M–1 s–1 per TCO unit was observed for
the reaction
of 15 with PeptoBrush 1, providing a 45-fold
increase compared to the rate constant of the reaction of 15 with 16 (Figure 3D). For the reactions of PeptoBrush 2 and PeptoBrush 3 with 15, the rate constants per TCO increased
by a factor of 7 and 3.5, respectively, compared to the reaction of 15 and 16 (SI Table S2). Interestingly, these results indicate that more lipophilic Tz
derivatives are more reactive toward PeptoBrushes 1–3. For example, the rate constant for 15 is more
than twice as high as that for the more hydrophilic Tz 14 when reacted with PeptoBrush 1. Such an increase was
not observed using the TCO control compound 16 (SI Table S2).

With PeptoBrush 1 exhibiting the highest reaction
rates, further experiments were conducted. To verify whether the TCO
loading of PeptoBrush 1 (as determined by 1H NMR) was consistent with the number of TCO units effectively participating
in the ligation, PeptoBrush 1 was reacted with 3,6-dimethyltetrazine
(17), and the characteristic absorption of Tz 17 was monitored by UV/vis spectroscopy. This titration revealed that
only 17.6 out of the 30 TCO units per PeptoBrush were accessible for
the ligation, which in turn implies higher reaction rates per TCO
unit and, thus, an even higher acceleration of up to 77-fold for the
reaction with 15 (Figure 3D, PeptoBrush 1 (corrected)). Next, we
investigated if the observed acceleration was in fact related to the
lipophilicity of the used tetrazines. In this respect, we also determined
the rate constants of the more hydrophilic Tz derivatives 18 and 19 (compared to 14 and 15) using UV/vis spectroscopy (Figure 3E and SI Table S1). A strong
dependency between the measured reaction rates in correlation to the
calculated logarithmic distribution coefficient at physiological pH
(C log D7.4) values for all investigated Tz derivatives was found. These results
further support the hypothesis that more lipophilic Tz derivatives
facilitate higher reaction rates.

Finally, the influence of
the biologic environment on the observed
acceleration effect was studied. In this respect, the reaction rate
between PeptoBrush 1 and Tz 15 was investigated
in full cell growth medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium, DMEM, including 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS) by stopped-flow
spectrometry. A lower but still significantly increased reaction rate
(17-fold) compared to the reaction of 15 with TCO 16 was observed in this medium (SI Table S1). Consequently, we hypothesized that the rate constant acceleration
effect of lipophilic Tz derivatives and TCO moieties within PeptoBrush 1 is also present in vivo, but the degree
of acceleration is dependent on the surrounding media.

Theoretical
Explanation of the Observed Rate Constant Acceleration
Effect
The Smoluchowski theory can explain a rate constant
increase of about 3 if a typical binding energy win between nonpolar
groups on the order of 0.7 kcal/mol is assumed per lipophilic Tz/TCO
interaction (see SI).48 Such rate constant increases are observed for PeptoBrushes 2 and 3. However, the enormous rate constant
increase (77-fold) between PeptoBrush 1 and 15 cannot solely be explained by the Smoluchowski theory. Significant
rearrangements of polymer chains are needed to increase the rate constant
to such levels. Thereby, proximal TCO units have to cooperatively
create binding sites with increased affinity to lipophilic Tz derivatives
on the order of 2 kcal/mol. This value corresponds to numbers usually
obtained by interaction of 2–3 hydrophobic binding sites. In
order to explore if a higher degree of TCO functionalization leads
to massive polymer chain rearrangement and an increased number of
affinity binding sites, coarse-grained simulations of the PeptoBrushes
were performed. Here, a functionalization of 0, 8, 15, and 30% TCO
units was used.

Simulations were carried out using a simple
spring-bead model in which the polymer units are described as beads
connected with massless virtual harmonic springs.49 TCO units were treated as polymer units connected to a
backbone string. The units exhibit, beside the harmonic potential
of the virtual springs, nonpolar interactions on the order of 0.7
kcal/mol per TCO/TCO interface. Subsequent simulations showed that
polymer chains significantly rearranged for high TCO loading, whereas
TCO remained isolated in PeptoBrushes with low TCO content (Figure 4A–D). In the
case of the highest load (30 units), TCO units within a single PeptoBrush
aggregated and formed internal hydrophobic patches (Figure 4D). Within these patches, lipophilic
Tz derivatives find nonpolar areas where they interact with more than
one TCO unit. The attractive interaction within these areas can easily
reach values above 2 kcal/mol. As such, an enormous rate constant
increase is expected when nonpolar patches are formed. Figure 4E illustrates that the number
of TCO/TCO contacts per unit sharply increases when the number of
TCO units exceeds 25. At this number, hydrophobic patches are formed
and a massive acceleration of the rate constant between these TCO
patches and lipophilic Tz derivatives is expected to occur. Interestingly,
the overall radius of gyration of the PeptoBrush remained almost constant
with increased numbers of TCO/TCO contacts, whereas the end-to-end
distance of the backbone chain decreased (Figure 4F). This is perfectly in line with the dynamic
light scattering data for PeptoBrushes 1–4.

Stability of PeptoBrush 1 in Human Plasma
As PeptoBrush 1 showed
the highest reactivity, this
polymer was selected for further evaluation studies in tumor-bearing
mice. However, before performing the in vivo evaluation,
the behavior of PeptoBrush 1 in human plasma was studied.
Even though polypeptide-graft-polypeptoid copolymers
have been shown to be biocompatible and not prone to aggregation in vivo,39 alteration of the graft copolymer microstructure and the incorporation of
hydrophobic TCO moieties within the pGlu backbone may alter this behavior
and result in aggregation with serum proteins. In light of this, the
behavior of PeptoBrush 1 in human serum was studied by
DLS.51 No aggregation was detected between
human serum proteins and PeptoBrush 1 at a concentration
of 50 mg/L (SI Figure S7). This concentration
is on the order of previously reported concentrations required for
pretargeting approaches in vivo, and as such, no
aggregation of these structures was expected to occur in vivo.27,35 The plasma half-life of TCO moieties in
PeptoBrush 1 was determined to be 1.9 days (see SI for experimental procedures), which is comparable
to observed half-lives of TCO moieties attached to mAbs. Compared
to free TCO moieties, the plasma half-life increased approximately
14-fold.37

Evaluation of PeptoBrush 1 as a Potential Primary
Targeting Agent
With no aggregation as well as with a reasonable
plasma half-life of TCO moieties in PeptoBrush 1, in vivo evaluation experiments were initiated. In order
to investigate if PeptoBrush 1 could be used for tumor
targeting, we first used conventional SPECT imaging to study the biodistribution
of the polymer over time. Thus, PeptoBrush 1 was radiolabeled
with the long-lived radionuclide indium-111 (111In, t1/2 = 2.8 days). Radiolabeling succeeded via ligation to a previously described 111In-labeled
Tz derivative ([111In]20) (Scheme 2).27 The reaction was conducted at room temperature in PBS, and full
consumption of [111In]20 was observed within
less than 10 min. The following evaluation in tumor-bearing mice was
carried out with the assumption that the in vivo behavior
between the radiolabeled version of PeptoBrush 1 ([111In]21) and PeptoBrush 1 only differs
negligibly.

n = 100, m = 30 – x, x =
unknown, k = 24 (see Table 1).

[111In]21 (50 MBq/150 μL of PBS with
an apparent specific activity (As) of
109 MBq/mg) was injected i.v. into mice (n = 4) bearing
subcutaneous CT26 tumors (mouse colorectal cancer). This tumor model
was chosen as it generally shows a pronounced EPR effect.52 Small animal SPECT/CT imaging was carried out
at 2, 22, and 72 h postinjection (p.i.). Visual inspection of the
images showed that radiolabeled PeptoBrush 1 ([111In]21) accumulated selectively in CT26 tumors. Uptake
kinetics were slow with an initial large fraction of radioactivity
in blood that decreased over time. Consequently, tumor uptake and
contrast improved gradually and significantly (Figure 5A). Quantification showed that the mean tumor
uptake (±standard error of mean (SEM)) increased approximately
2-fold from initially 2.3 ± 0.1%ID/g (at 2 h p.i.) to 5.1 ±
0.3%ID/g (at 22 h p.i.). No significant change in uptake was observed
between 22 and 72 h p.i. (Figure 5B). Considering the average tumor accumulation of polymer-based
nanomedicines, which is on the order of 0.7%ID/g, the observed accumulation
of 5–6% is very satisfactory.53 Tumor-to-background
ratios were determined using the hind leg muscle tissue and the heart
as surrogates for nontarget tissue and blood, respectively. Best ratios
were achieved at 72 h p.i. with a tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio of 11.6
and a tumor-to-blood (T/B) ratio of 2.8 (Figure 5E,F). Lower ratios were observed at earlier
time points (SI Table S4). Signal from
well perfused organs (e.g., liver and kidney) were
relatively high (5–6%ID/g) 2 h p.i. but decreased over time.

Next, we explored the capability of PeptoBrush 1 to
function as a primary targeting agent for pretargeted imaging. For
this purpose, the same 111In-labeled Tz ([111In]20), which was used for conventional imaging was
applied as a secondary imaging agent. Even though this Tz is too hydrophilic
to achieve the observed accelerating effect in reaction kinetics upon
ligation with PeptoBrush 1 (Figure 3E), it was selected because it has previously
been used successfully in pretargeting strategies using TCO-modified
mAbs.27,36,37 Thereby, using
[111In]20 would allow us to study the performance
of PeptoBrush 1 as a primary targeting agent without
questioning the in vivo efficacy of the applied Tz
imaging agent. We chose to use a lag time of 72 h between administration
of PeptoBrush 1 and [111In]20 because a good tumor-to-background contrast had been observed at
this time point using conventional imaging. First, PeptoBrush 1 (1 mg in 100 μL of PBS) was administered to CT26 tumor-bearing
mice and 72 h later [111In]20 (∼50
MBq, 100 μL, with a molar activity (Am) of 5.4 GBq/μmol) was injected. The molar amount of [111In]20 was adjusted to 11 nmol/mouse by adding
the precursor (Tz 19) of [111In]20 to the injection solution. The TCO/Tz ratio was 17 at the time of
injection. Animals were scanned using SPECT/CT 2 and 22 h p.i. and
gained images subsequently analyzed (Figure 5C,D). Mean tumor accumulation (±SEM)
increased significantly from 3.4 ± 0.3%ID/g (at 2 h p.i.) to
8.1 ± 0.8%ID/g (at 22 h p.i.). Notably, these tumor uptake values
are significantly higher, both after 2 and 22 h, than the uptake values
obtained using conventional imaging.

It is important to keep
in mind that the uptake values from pretargeted
imaging do not, like conventional imaging, give a measure for the
fraction of polymer that accumulates in tissue. Instead, it provides
a quantification of the administered Tz fraction that binds to the
polymer accumulated in the respective tissue. Thereby, different tumor
uptake values are expected for conventional imaging compared to pretargeted
imaging. Our observation that higher tumor uptake was reached in the
pretargeted study at later time points (22 h) is in contrast to the
vast majority of current literature that reports that a higher tumor
accumulation is achieved by conventional imaging within this time
frame. However, there is no theoretical limitation preventing pretargeting
in reaching higher accumulation values. To exclude that the observed
uptake is due to nonspecific tumor binding, we determined the biodistribution
of [111In]20. No significant tumor accumulation
of [111In]20 occurred when no primary targeting
agent was injected prior to administration of [111In]20 at all time points (SI Figure S14). Interestingly, the observed tumor accumulation, especially the
increase between the 2 and 20 h time point, cannot solely be explained
from ligation of [111In]20 to PeptoBrush 1 at the tumor site, given that the ligation between PeptoBrush 1 and [111In]20 is extremely fast,
and the biological half-life of [111In]20 is
only 9.8 min.21 We suggest that the detected
tumor increase is a result from both initial ligation between [111In]20 and PeptoBrush 1 at the
tumor site and by EPR-mediated uptake of in vivo labeled
PeptoBrush 1 that was formed in the blood pool within
the first minutes upon injection of [111In]20. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that high radioactivity
levels are observed in heart and aorta in SPECT images at 2 h p.i.
and that these activity levels decrease over time (Figure 5C,D). This accumulation profile
could also not be observed in mice that were not pretreated with PeptoBrush 1, but a similar accumulation profile was observed in conventional
imaging. In conclusion, the pretargeting study resulted in a higher
tumor uptake, but the image contrast was not improved compared to
the conventional imaging. An increased tumor accumulation is usually
beneficial for targeted radionuclide therapy. Therefore, the observed
higher radioactivity levels in tumor tissue indicates that pretargeted
radionuclide therapy with PeptoBrush 1 could potentially
improve not only healthy tissue dosimetry but also the absolute dose
delivered to the target. In order to reach the full potential of the
polymer for radiotherapy, accumulation in healthy tissue, especially
in blood, has to be substantially reduced. In other preclinical studies
of pretargeting, this has been achieved by using a clearing or masking
agent.54

Despite the high tumor uptake,
low T/M and T/B ratios, especially
at the early 2 h time point (Figure 5E,F), are not ideal for pretargeted imaging as this
process should optimally be performed within a few hours. From a clinical
perspective, a long waiting time for adequate imaging contrast complicates
logistics, increases expenses, and enhances the risk that a patient
will not appear for a scheduled scan. Moreover, the ability to image
at an early time point allows for radiolabeling of Tz derivatives
with short-lived radionuclides, which in turn lowers the radiation
dose for the patient.

Based on these considerations, we decided
to optimize the dose
as well as the timing of PeptoBrush 1 administration
with the aim to improve the tumor-to-background ratio at earlier time
points (2 h).

Optimization of the Pretargeting Strategy
with Respect to Dosing
and Timing
Experiments for dose optimization were performed
with the same pretargeting setup applied previously. Four different
doses of PeptoBrush 1 (50, 100, 250, or 500 μg
dissolved in 100 μL of PBS) were examined. Animals were euthanized
at 2 h p.i. for ex vivo biodistribution studies.
Tissues were resected and weighed, and the fraction of [111In]20 in each tissue was determined using a gamma counter.
Administration of low doses of PeptoBrush 1 (50 and 100
μg) resulted in relatively low tumor uptake of [111In]20. However, in animals receiving the higher doses
(250 and 500 μg), this also led to an increased tumor uptake
of 1.5- and 3-fold, respectively (Figure 6A and SI Table S5). In contrast, higher tumor-to-background ratios (approximately
3-fold) were observed for both lower doses (Figure 6B,C), and consequently, these doses are preferred
for imaging.

mice injected with 50, 100, 250, or 500 μg of PeptoBrush 1 72 h earlier (n = 4). Data are shown as
mean and standard error of mean (SEM) (D) Ex vivo biodistribution showing uptake values (%ID/g), (E) tumor-to-muscle

points for CT26 tumor-bearing mice injected with 100 μg of [111In]21 (n = 3 for each time
point). Data are shown as mean and standard error of mean (SEM).

In a next step, we aimed to identify the optimal
lag time between
injection of PeptoBrush 1 and [111In]20. The optimal timing for administration of [111In]20, the secondary imaging agent, is when the primary
targeting agent, PeptoBrush 1, has accumulated sufficiently
in the tumor and cleared as much as possible from background tissues. Ex vivo studies were carried out to investigate this using
the optimized dose of [111In]21 (10 MBq, 100
μL, 100 μg apparent As = 101
MBq/mg). Animals were euthanized at designated time points between
2 and 144 h p.i. (n = 3 for each time point), and
the biodistribution was determined (Figure 6D). As expected, based on the results from
conventional SPECT imaging with the 1 mg dose of [111In]21, the mean tumor uptake increased between 2 to 48 h p.i.
and started to linearly decrease afterward until the end of the study
(Figure 6D). The muscle
uptake was relatively stable over time; hence the T/M ratio followed
the same trend (Figure 6E). Uptake in blood, lung, and kidney decreased nearly exponentially
from 2 to 144 h p.i. Subsequently, T/B ratios increased almost linearly
over time (Figure 6F). Overall, the initial and continuous increase in tumor uptake
of [111In]21 from 2 to 48 h was expected as
it is EPR-mediated accumulation. However, the following decrease was
not expected. We believe that this decrease is partly due the biodegradability
of polypeptide-graft-polypeptoids, which should be
more pronounced after 48 h.38−40,42 Control experiments were carried out using a dose of 500 μg
[111In]21 (SI Figure S15). Although slightly higher tumor uptake was initially achieved at
48 h p.i. (approximately 20%), the same trend was observed compared
to the results obtained within the 100 μg dose study.

On the basis of these results, we decided to use a dose of 100
μg and a lag time of 72 h for a new set of pretargeting studies.
The reasons for using a lag time of 72 h were as follows: even though
the tumor uptake and T/M ratio peaked at 48 h p.i., the T/B ratio
continued to increase over time, and a large decrease in the blood
uptake was detected between 48 and 72 h p.i. A later time point than
72 h was not chosen, despite improved T/B ratio in the conventional
imaging study because we determined a plasma half-life of 1.9 days
of TCO moieties in PeptoBrush 1. Therefore, longer time
frames could lead to a lower probability of the tetrazine ligation
occurring.

Pretargeted Imaging with PeptoBrush 1 under Optimized
Conditions
A new set of pretargeted imaging experiments was
performed to investigate if a lower dose of PeptoBrush 1 would indeed lead to an improved tumor-to-background ratio. Pretargeted
imaging was performed as previously described with a 72 h lag time
between injection of PeptoBrush 1 (now with 100 μg
in 100 μL of PBS) and administration of [111In]20 (∼25 MBq, 100 μL, with an apparent Am of 0.9 GBq/μmol). The TCO/Tz ratio at
the time of injection was 1.70. Animals were imaged at 2 and 22 h
after administration of [111In]20. Visual
inspection of the SPECT/CT scans showed that the tumor contrast greatly
improved, and adequate image contrast was already obtained 2 h p.i.
This was in contrast to previous experiments using 1 mg of PeptoBrush 1 (Figure 7A versusFigure 5C). Image analysis showed that the mean tumor accumulation
was low at 2 h p.i. (0.47 ± 0.04%ID/g) (Figure 7B) and, interestingly, did not change significantly
during the course of the study with an observed uptake of 0.52 ±
0.05%ID/g at 22 h p.i. (Figure 7C). In general, low uptake values were detected in all examined
tissues, with the kidneys and the bladder showing the highest uptake
(Figure 7A,D). This
observation indicated that [111In]20 is not
any longer primarily reacting with PeptoBrush 1 still
circulating in the blood pool, as observed for the 1 mg dose. Instead,
ligation between [111In]20 and PeptoBrush 1 almost exclusively occurred at the tumor site, and unreacted
[111In]20 was rapidly renally excreted. In
contrast to the 1 mg dose, less radiolabeled PeptoBrush 1 is then available for EPR-mediated tumor accumulation, and thus,
no massive increase in tumor uptake can be observed over time. However,
despite the low tumor uptake, T/M and T/B ratios were improved compared
to the 1 mg study (Figure 7E,F and SI Table S6). For example,
the T/B ratio increased by a factor of 5 at the 2 h time point and
by a factor of 1.5 at the 22 h time point. Consequently, at early
time points, the pretargeting strategy resulted in higher imaging
contrast compared to conventional imaging (100 μg, [111In]21; SI Figure S16).

Binding Specificity of
[111In]20 toward
PeptoBrushes
To further strengthen that the ligation between
[111In]20 and TCO moieties of the polymer
indeed occurs at the tumor site and that [111In]20 is not interacting nonspecifically with the polymeric architecture
of the primary targeting agent, additional control experiments using
PeptoBrush 3 and PeptoBrush 4 were performed
using the same pretargeting strategy (100 μg dose of polymer
and lag time of 72 h). PeptoBrush 3 has a lower TCO loading
(8%) compared to that of PeptoBrush 1 (30%), whereas
PeptoBrush 4 is a polymer without TCO moieties. PeptoBrush 3 and PeptoBrush 4 did not result in significant
tumor uptake in comparison to PeptoBrush 1 (Figure 7A,D). This observation
indicates that the tetrazine ligation takes place in vivo at the tumor site and that the degree of TCO loading affects the
performance of the in vivo ligation.

Conclusion
In the present work, we have developed easily accessible and biodegradable
TCO-functionalized copolymers, so-called PeptoBrushes, which show
EPR-mediated tumor accumulation on the order of approximately 6% and
allow for bioorthogonal chemistry. The core–shell structure
adopted by the PeptoBrushes allowed for a high TCO loading, without
causing aggregation. Moreover, the high degree of TCO loading resulted
in extremely fast reaction kinetics, particularly with a lipophilic
Tz. We suggest that the fast second-order rate constants might arise
as a result of a combined hydrophobic effect and significant rearrangements
of the side chains within each polymer when approximately 25% of all
side chains are functionalized with TCO moieties. These rearrangements
create hydrophobic TCO patches consisting of 2–3 TCO moieties,
which in turn act as high-affinity binding sites for lipophilic Tz
frameworks.

These exciting reaction rate enhancements encouraged
us to evaluate
PeptoBrush 1, which had the highest TCO loading (30%)
of all developed PeptoBrushes, by both conventional and pretargeted
SPECT/CT imaging in tumor-bearing mice. Here, our pretargeting strategy
provided adequate image contrast of the tumor already 2 h after administration
of the radiolabeled Tz. In order to further improve the image contrast
in the pretargeting strategy, the amount of PeptoBrush 1 still circulating in the blood pool has to be reduced. This is a
challenge with respect to pretargeting strategies for both imaging
and radionuclide therapy. Future efforts are directed toward finding
an appropriate clearing or masking agent to increase the tumor-to-background
ratio so that the full potential of PeptoBrush 1 as a
primary targeting agent can be unravelled, especially for theranostic
approaches. For additional optimization of the pretargeting strategy,
we suggest developing a less hydrophilic Tz imaging agent, compared
to the one used in the present work. This would enable higher reaction
rates and potentially improve efficiency of the in vivo ligation at the tumor site and thus potentially also give a higher
tumor uptake. In summary, PeptoBrush 1 displays excellent
properties for a primary targeting agent. Future studies will be centered
on increasing the absolute radioactivity concentration in the tumor,
lowering background levels further with the aim of utilizing PeptoBrush 1 in pretargeted theranostic studies. However, current tumor-to-background
levels are sufficient for pretargeted imaging aiming to visualize
EPR-mediated tumor uptake of nanomedicines as early as 2 h after injection
of the secondary imaging agent.

Methods
1H NMR (400 MHz)
and diffusion-ordered
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 400 spectrometer at
room temperature. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million
and were referenced to the solvent residual signal. The analysis of
the 1H NMR spectra was performed using the software MestReNova
v12.0.0 (Mestrelab Research S.L.). Analytical hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP) SEC was carried out at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min at 40 °C
with 3 g/L potassium trifluoroacetate added to the eluent. The SEC
system was equipped with a UV detector (Jasco UV-2075 Plus) set at
a wavelength of 230 nm and an RI detector (Jasco RI-2031). Modified
silica gel columns (PFG columns, particle size: 7 μm, porosity:
100 and 1000 Å) were used. Molecular weights were determined
by using a calibration with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) standards
(Polymer Standards Service GmbH) and toluene as an internal standard.
Degree of polymerization of pSar was determined by calibration of
apparent Mn against a
series of pSar standards characterized by static light scattering
to obtain absolute molecular weights. Prior to measurement, the samples
were filtered through polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filters
with a pore size of 0.2 μm. The elution diagram was analyzed
with WinGPC software (Polymer Standards Service GmbH). Attenuated
total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy
was performed on a FT/IR-4100 (JASCO Corporation) with an ATR sampling
accessory (MIRacleTM, Pike Technologies). The IR spectra were analyzed
with the software Spectra Manager version 2.02.05 (JASCO Corporation).
For each measurement, 16 scans were performed. For multiangle dynamic
light scattering, cylindrical quartz cuvettes (Hellma) were cleaned
by dust-free distilled acetone and transferred to a dust-free flow
box. Solutions were filtered into the cuvettes through syringe filters.
DLS measurements were performed by an apparatus consisting of a Uniphase
He/Ne Laser (22.5 mW output power at λ = 632.8 nm), an ALV/SP125
goniometer with an ALV 5000/E/PCI correlator, and an ALV/High QEAPD
Avalanche photodiode detector. All samples were measured at 20 °C.
To investigate the aggregation behavior of the particles in human
serum, serum pooled from six probands was used. The serum was obtained
from the University Medical Center Mainz and filtered through a Millex
GS 0.22 μm filter (Merck Millipore). The particle solution was
filtered through a 0.02 μm pore size Anotop filter (Whatman),
and the buffer was filtered through a 0.2 μm pore size GHP filter
(Acrodisc). The following mixtures were prepared: serum/PBS 9:1 and
serum/particle solution 9:1 (Cpolymer =
0.05 g/L). The cuvettes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature
before measurement. The correlation functions of the particles were
fitted using a sum of two exponentials. The z-average
diffusion coefficient Dz was calculated
by extrapolating Dapp for q = 0. By formal application of Stokes law, the inverse z-average hydrodynamic radius is Rh =
⟨Rh – 1⟩z – 1. Single-angle DLS and ζ-potential measurements
were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire,
UK) equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne laser at a fixed scattering
angle of 173° at 25 °C. Three measurements were performed
per sample at 1 mg/mL in 10 mM NaCl solution as solvent, and size
distribution (intensity-weighted) histograms were calculated based
on the autocorrelation function of samples, with automated attenuator
adjustment and multiple scans (typically 10–15 scans). Disposable
polystyrene cuvettes (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for size
measurements and disposable folded capillary cells (Malvern Instruments
Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) for ζ-potential measurements. Malvern
Zetasizer Software version 7.12 was used to analyze the data. For
cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM), 5 μL of
the polymer solution (1 mg/mL, in 10 mM NaCl) was applied to freshly
glow-discharged carbon grids with a copper 200 mesh (Quantfoil Micro
Tools GmbH). Excess fluid was removed by direct blotting (2.5 s),
and the grids were individually plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Grids
were cryotransferred in liquid nitrogen using a Gatan cryoholder (model
626 DH) to a Technai T12 transmission electron microscope equipped
with a field emission electron source and operating at 120 kV accelerating
voltage. Images were recorded using a TemCam-F416 (TVIPS, Gauting,
Germany). Melting points were measured using a Mettler FP62 melting
point apparatus at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The C log D7.4 values used for
the correlation between lipophilicity and reaction kinetics were obtained
from Chemicalize software. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried
out using normal phase plates (silica gel 60 coated with fluorescent
indicator F254s) from Merck. The fraction of radioactivity on the
TLC plates was measured with an instant imager from Packard InstantImager
and analyzed by Optiquant software. Analytical high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Dionex system connected to
a P680A pump, a UVD 170U detector, and a radiodetector from Scansys
Laboratorieteknik. HPLC control and spectra processing were done with
Chromeleon 6.8 software.

Synthesis of Homopolymers
Poly(γ-benzyl-l-glutamic acid) (6)
The synthesis of 6 was carried out as previously
described.38N-Carboxyanhydride
(NCA) 5 (667 mg, 2.54 mmol) was transferred into a predried
Schlenk tube equipped with a stir bar under nitrogen counter flow
and dried under high vacuum for 1 h prior to solvation in absolute
DMF (6.5 mL). A solution of neopentylamine (4.45 μL, 0.04 mmol)
in dry DMF (1.5 mL) was flushed with argon, before 1 mL of this solution
was added to the solution of 5 for initiation of polymerization.
The mixture was stirred at 0 °C and kept at a constant pressure
of 1.25 bar of dry nitrogen. Completion of the reaction was confirmed
by FTIR spectroscopy (disappearance of the NCA peaks (1855 and 1788
cm–1)). Thereafter, trimethylamine (71 μL,
0.51 mmol) and acetic anhydride (24 μL, 0.25 mmol) were added,
and the mixture was stirred overnight in order to cap the amine end
group. The polymer was precipitated into diethyl ether and centrifuged
(4500 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min). After the liquid fraction was
discarded, additional diethyl ether was added, and the polymer was
resuspended in a sonication bath. The suspension was centrifuged again,
and the procedure was repeated. After DMF removal by the resuspension
steps, the polymer was dispersed in water and lyophilized to afford 6 (489 mg, 97%) as fine colorless polymer flakes: 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6/CDCl3) δ 8.80–7.90 (61H, br, −CH–NH–CO−), 7.35–7.10 (515H (5n), br, −CH2–C6H5), 5.15–4.80 (200H (2n), br, −O–CH2–C6H5), 4.25–3.65 (91H (1n), br, −CO–CH–NH−), 2.75–1.70 (302H (4n), m, −CH2–CH2−), 0.86 (9H, s, CH2–C(CH3)3). SEC in HFIP (vs PMMA standards): Mn = 21.1 kg/mol, Đ = 1.13.

Polyglutamic Acid (7)
Deprotection of 6 was carried out according to the literature.57 The pGlu(OBn)100 (233 mg) was dissolved
in TFA (2.5 mL) in a Schlenk tube equipped with a stir bar. The solution
was stirred for 10 min, and thereafter 48% v/v HBr (240 μL,
2 equiv per carboxyl group) was added dropwise and the mixture was
stirred at room temperature overnight. The next day, the solution
was precipitated into cold diethyl ether and centrifuged (4500 rpm
at 4 °C for 15 min). After the liquid fraction was discarded,
additional diethyl ether was added and the polymer was resuspended
in a sonication bath. The suspension was centrifuged again, and the
procedure was repeated. Remaining diethyl ether was removed under
a stream of nitrogen to afford 7 (134 mg, 97%) as a colorless
solid: 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O/NaOD) δ 4.15–4.00
(100H (n), m, −HN–CH–CO−),
2.10–1.95 (217H (2n), m, −CH2–COOH), 1.90–1.60 (221H (2n), m, CH–CH2–CH2−),
0.64 (9H, s, −C(CH3)3).

Polysarcosine (12)
pSar (12) was synthesized in a similar fashion
as previously described but
with minor adjustments due to the volatile nature of the initiator.38 Sar-NCA 13 (714 mg, 11.0 mmol)
was transferred into a predried Schlenk tube equipped with a stir
bar under nitrogen counter flow and dried under high vacuum for 1
h prior to reaction. NCA 13 was dissolved in absolute
DMF (10 mL), and 93.7 μL of a solution of isoproylamine (0.2
mL in 1.8 mL of DMF) was added for initiation with an Eppendorf pipet
against nitrogen counter flow. The solution was stirred overnight
at room temperature and kept at a constant pressure of 1.25 bar of
dry nitrogen via the Schlenk line. Completion of
the reaction was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (disappearance of
the NCA peaks (1853 and 1786 cm–1)). The polymer
was precipitated into diethyl ether and centrifuged (4500 rpm at 4
°C for 10 min). After the liquid fraction was discarded, additional
diethyl ether was added and the polymer was resuspended in a sonication
bath. The suspension was centrifuged again, and the procedure was
repeated. After DMF removal by the resuspension steps, the polymer
was dissolved in water and lyophilized to afford 12 (436
mg, 98%) as a fluffy colorless polymer: 1H NMR (400 MHz,
DMSO-d6) δ 4.70–3.70 (194H
(2n), br, −NCH3–CH2–CO−), 3.10–2.60 (317H (3n), br,
−NCH3), 1.10–1.00
(6H, m, −CH(CH3)2). SEC in HFIP (vs PMMA standards): Mn = 22.2 kg/mol, Đ = 1.10. Degree of polymerization was determined to be 82 by calibration
of apparent Mn against
a series of pSar standards characterized by static light scattering
to obtain absolute molecular weights.58

TCO Functionalization
4-(4,6-Dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl
Morpholinium Chloride
4-(4,6-Dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl
morpholinium chloride
(DMTMM Cl) was freshly prepared according to literature.59N-Methyl morpholine (1.73 g,
17.1 mmol) was added to a solution of 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine
(3.00 g, 17.1 mmol) in dry THF (100 mL). The mixture was stirred at
room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h. The precipitate
was collected by filtration under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 2 h
of constant nitrogen flow through the precipitate and 2 h under high
vacuum, DMTMM Cl (3.44 g, 73%) was afforded as colorless crystals,
which were aliquoted into 2 mL Eppendorf vials and stored at −20
°C: 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 4.60–4.50 (2H, d,br, −N+CH2−), 4.10–4.00 (8H, m, −OCH3 and CH3N+CH2), 3.65–3.90 (4H, m, −OCH2−),
3.45 (3H, s, −N+CH3). The procedure for
TCO functionalization toward PeptoBrush 9 is described
below. PeptoBrushes 10 and 11 were synthesized
according to the same procedure in 34 and 36% yields, respectively.

PeptoBrush 9
The deprotected and lyophilized
p(Glu100) (57.6 mg, 0.409 mmol COOH), ((E)-cyclooct-4-en-1-yl(3-aminopropyl)carbamate) (32.2 mg, 0.12 mmol,
0.3 equiv) and NaHCO3 (172 mg, 2.04 mmol, 5 equiv) were
dissolved in MP water (6 mL) and DMSO (1.2 mL). The mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 30 min before DMTMM Cl salt (113.0 mg, 0.409
mmol, 1 equiv) was added, and the solution was stirred at room temperature
under a nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h. After 24 h, additional DMTMM
Cl (113.0 mg, 0.409 mmol, 1 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred
for 24 h. The adduct was purified by dialysis against a 6–8
kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) regenerated cellulose membrane
for 1 week with daily change of water. After lyophilization, PeptoBrush 9 (56.5 mg, 74%) was obtained as a fluffy colorless powder: 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ 5.60–5.20 (60H
(2m), m, CH=CH), 4.40–3.80
(206H (m+n), −HN–CH–CO– and O–CH–(CH2)2), 3.20–2.70 (156H, d,br), 2.40–1.60
(1037H, br), 1.60–1.20 (187H br), 0.71–0.62 (9H, s,br
−C(CH3)3).

Polysarcosinylation
The procedure for pSar grafting
of PeptoBrush 9 to afford PeptoBrush 1 is
described below. PeptoBrushes 2 (25% yield), 3 (20% yield), and 4 (30% yield) were synthesized according
to the same procedure from PeptoBrushes 10 and 11 and the pGlu backbone 4, respectively.

PeptoBrush 1
To PeptoBrush 9 (5.70 mg, 0.03 mmol,
1 equiv Glu) were added 12 (91.0
mg, 0.02 mmol, 0.5 equiv (per Glu)) and NaHCO3 (26.0 mg,
0.31 mmol, 10 equiv). The reagents were dissolved in MP water (2 mL)
and DMSO (0.4 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. DMTMM
Cl (17.0 mg, 0.06 mmol, 2 equiv) was added, and the mixture was stirred
overnight. After 24 and 48 h, additional fresh DMTMM Cl (17 mg, 0.0613
mmol, 2 equiv) was added, and SEC analysis (sampling of reaction solutions
(5 μL) added to toluene (10 μL) in HFIP (1 mL), filtered
through a 450 nm PTFE filter as sample preparation) revealed increasing
brush size after the first but not the second successive step, which
indicated close to saturated functionalization. The solution was thereafter
transferred into Vivaspin 2 centrifugation filters with a molecular
weight cutoff of 20 kDa in two steps, diluted to a total volume of
2 mL with MP water, and spun 2 × 20 min. The filtrates were removed
after every centrifugation step. After concentration, the filters
were again diluted to a total volume of 2 mL with MP water and centrifuged
as previously described. The procedure was repeated six times until
SEC analysis revealed no significant amounts of remaining pSar homopolymers.
After lyophilization, the purified brush polymer (18 mg, 39% referred
to the brush species) was afforded: 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ 5.80–5.40 (18H (2m), m, CH=CH), 4.70–3.80 (3531H (1n+1m+164k), HN–CH2–CO + HN–CH–CO
+ O–CH–(CH2)2), 3.40–2.80
(5200H (246k), m, N–CH3), 2.70–1.80 (303H, br), 1.80–1.40 (45H, br), 1.20–1.10
(109H (6k), m, −CH(CH3)2), 0.85 (9H, s, −C(CH3)3).

Kinetic Studies
Reaction kinetics
of the TCO moieties
in PeptoBrushes 1–3 and TCO control
compound 16 with fluorogenic turn-on Tz derivatives 14 and 15 were determined by pseudo-first-order
measurements in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37.0 ± 0.1 °C following
the increase of fluorescence at >400 nm. Reaction kinetics of the
TCO moieties of PeptoBrushes 1 and 16 with
Tz derivatives 18 and 19 were determined
under the same conditions following the decrease of tetrazine absorbance
at 535 nm. Measurements were performed using a SX20 stopped-flow photometer
(Applied Photophysics, UK) equipped with either a 360 nm LED light
source and a photomultiplier-type R374 in combination with a 400 nm
long-pass filter for fluorescence measurements or a 535 nm LED light
source and a photomultiplier-type R928 for absorbance measurements.
Twenty millimolar stock solutions of 14 and 15 in DMSO-d6 were diluted in PBS (1:40000
or 1:200000), resulting in 500 and 100 nM solutions, respectively.
For fluorescence measurements, solutions of PeptoBrushes 1–3 and 16 were prepared to yield
TCO concentrations exceeding 10 μM to ensure pseudo-first-order
conditions. Tz and TCO solutions were mixed 1:1 (v/v) during measurements,
resulting in 250 or 50 nM solution of 14 or 15 and TCO concentrations of ≥5 μM. In the case of absorbance
measurements, solutions of Peptobrushes 1 and 16 were prepared to yield TCO concentrations exceeding 500 μM.
Tz solution concentrations were adjusted to 50 μM.

Reaction
kinetics under biological conditions were measured in Gibco Fluorobrite
DMEM including 10% fetal bovine serum at 37.0 ± 0.1 °C.
The used concentrations, observed rate constants, and calculated second-order
rate constants are shown in SI Tables S1 and S2.

Determination of the Number of Reactive TCO Units per Polymer
A solution of PeptoBrush 1 in DMSO (1 mL, 8 μM)
was mixed in a cuvette with an excess (1.5 equiv) of a solution of
3,6-dimethyltetrazine (17, 98.7 μM), and the absorption
at 535 nm was monitored using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop OneC UV–vis spectrophotometer until a constant value was
reached. Subsequently, another half equiv of Tz was added, and the
measurement was repeated. This procedure was carried out an additional
three times (five data points in total). The Tz concentration was
plotted against the measured absorption, and the linear regression
was extrapolated to intersect the x-axis, with the
intersection point equating to the effective TCO concentration (SI Table S3).

Coarse-Grained Computer
Simulations
The coarse-grained
computer simulations were based on a standard spring-bead model with
FENE bonds and nonbonded purely repulsive Lennard-Jones-type (i.e., WCA-type) interactions between beads. The brushes
have a regular architecture and consist of a backbone chain with 101
monomers (beads) and 25 side chains with 80 monomers each. TCO units
are distributed evenly on the backbone with the constraint that monomers
that serve as starting points for side chains cannot carry a TCO unit.
Monomers carrying a TCO unit have additional attractive interactions
with a potential depth of 1.5 thermal energy units. The detailed equations
for the potentials are given in the SI.
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed at constant temperature
using the Verlet algorithm with a time step of Δτ = 0.001τ
in Lennard-Jones time units τ. After an equilibration period
of at least 1 × 105τ (corresponding to 100 Mio
time steps), data were collected over another 5 × 105τ (500 Mio time steps).

Radiolabeling of Tetrazine
Tz ([111In]20) was prepared as previously
described with minor modifications.27 For
the radiolabeling, [111In]InCl3 (300–1000
μL, 306–647 MBq) was added
to a solution of 1 M NH4OAc pH 5.0 (150–500 μL)
and DOTA-Tz precursor 19 (0.1 mg, 78 nmol, 50 μL
from stock solution in metal-free water). Depending on the amount
of [111In]InCl3 used for the labeling, half
of the volume 1 M NH4OAc pH 5.0 was needed. The mixture
was heated at 60 °C for 5 min, before 13 mM gentisic acid in
saline (29.3 μL) and 10 mM DTPA in PBS (5 μL) were added.
The mixture was heated at 60 °C for 5 additional minutes. Analysis
was performed by radio-TLC with 200 mM EDTA in MQ water as eluent
and with radio-HPLC on a Yarra 3 μm SEC-2000 LC column (300
× 7.8 mm) using Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.0) with 0.01% NaN3 as eluent.
[111In]20 was afforded in a radiochemical
yield of 94 ± 5% (n = 7), which was determined
by radio-TLC. Radio-TLC and radio-HPLC chromatograms are shown in
the SI. Afterward, the concentration of
the solution was adjusted with additional DOTA-functionalized Tz 19 to get a concentration of 11 nmol/100 μL for the
injections.

Radiolabeling of PeptoBrush 1
[111In]20 was diluted with PBS
(300–100 μL;
the volume for dilution depended on the total volume of the isolated
[111In]20 to reach a pH of approximately 7,
which is used for the labeling of the polymer; at pH <4.5, the
polymer tends to decompose), and PeptoBrush 1 (2 mg)
dissolved in PBS (200–500 μL) was added. After 10 min
at room temperature, the reaction was analyzed by radio-HPLC on a
Yarra 3 μm SEC-2000 LC column (300 × 7.8 mm) using Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.0)
with 0.01% NaN3 as eluent. [111In]21 was afforded in a radiochemical purity (RCP) of 76–99%, as
determined by radio-HPLC. In contrast, radio-TLC measurements indicated
that a RCP of >99% was achieved. The observed difference was attributed
to the fact that in our HPLC method, 111In3+ tends to get released from the chelator (for both [111In]20 and [111In]21). Afterward,
the concentration of PeptoBrush 1 in the labeling solution
was adjusted to get the correct dose per 100 μL for injections.

Animal Model
All animal studies were approved by the
Danish Animal Welfare Council, Ministry of Justice. Five week old
female Balb/c mice (Charles River) were allowed to acclimatize for
1 week with access to water and chow ad libitum.
Mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26; obtained from ATCC) was cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were harvested by trypsinization at a confluence of 80–90%,
and subcutaneous tumors were established in the left flank of the
animals by inoculation of ∼3 × 105 CT26 cells
resuspended in growth media (100 μL) and allowed to grow for
2 weeks. Tumors were measured using a caliper, and the volume was
calculated using the formula, volume = 1/2(length × width2).

SPECT/CT Imaging
Animals were imaged
with a small animal
SPECT/CT scanner (nanoSPECT/CT, Mediso) with four detector heads.
CT scans were acquired following a semicircular multifield of view
method in Nucline Software: 720 projections, 35 kVp, 980 μA,
450 ms, 1:4 binning and reconstructed using small voxel size, thin
slice thickness, and cosine as filter type. SPECT images were acquired
using Nucline Software between 50.000 and 100.000; counts were achieved
for each projection; photopeaks were set to primary peak of 245.4
keV (20% full width) and secondary peak of 171.3 keV (20% full width).
After the last scan, all animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation.
The radioactivity, in two tubes containing different amounts of indium-111,
was measured in the dose calibrator, and the tubes were SPECT/CT scan
and used as external standards to validate quantification. SPECT images
were reconstructed using Tera-Tomo 3D SPECT reconstruction software.
The mean %ID/g in the tumor, muscle, heart, liver, and kidney was
extracted by manually drawing 2D regions of interest that was interpolated
to a 3D volume of interest using VivoQuant software.

Conventional
Imaging Studies
Groups of four tumor-bearing
animals (tumor volumes between 150 and 500 mm3) were administered
[111In]21 (100 μg, ∼10 MBq, apparent As of 114 MBq/mg; 500 μg, ∼40 MBq,
apparent As of 69 MBq/mg; 1000 μg,
∼50 MBq, apparent As of 109 MBq/mg) via the tail vein. The animals were anesthetized by breathing
sevoflurane and SPECT/CT scanned 2, 22, and 72 h p.i. of [111In]21.

Pretargeted Imaging Studies
Three
days before the study
started, tumor-bearing animals (n = 4) were injected
with either 100, 500, or 1000 μg of PeptoBrush 1 in 100 μL of PBS (0.1 M) in the tail vein. On the day of the
scan, the animals (tumor volumes between 150 and 500 mm3) were administered [111In]20 (100 μg,
∼25 MBq, 100 μL, with an apparent Am of 0.9 GBq/μmol; 500 μg, ∼15 MBq, 100
μL, with an apparent Am of 3.0 GBq/μmol;
1000 μg, ∼50 MBq, 95 μL, with an apparent Am of 5.4 GBq/μmol) via the tail vein. The animals were anesthetized by breathing sevoflurane
and SPECT/CT scanned 2 and 22 h p.i. of the 111In-labeled
Tz.

Ex Vivo Biodistribution
Dose Optimization
CT26 tumor-bearing mice were divided
into four groups based on their tumor volume (mean tumor volume of
= 130 ± 33 mm3, n = 4 in each group)
and were administered with either 50, 100, 250, or 500 μg of
PeptoBrush 1. After 72 h lag time, mice were administered
with [111In]20 (∼20 MBq, 100 μL,
apparent Am = 1.6 GBq/μmol) through
the tail vein. After 2 h, the animals were euthanized, tissue resected
and weighed, and the radioactivity measured on a gamma counter (Wizard2,
PerkinElmer). Data were corrected for decay, tissue weight, and injected
amount of radioactivity.

Optimization of Lag Time
CT26 tumor-bearing
animals
were divided into groups based on their tumor volume (mean tumor volume
of = 87 ± 39 mm3, n = 3 mice per
time point) and were administered with either 100 or 500 μg
of [111In]21 (100 μg, ∼10 MBq,
100 μL, apparent As = 101 MBq/mg;
500 μg, ∼8 MBq, 100 μL, apparent As = 13 MBq/mg) via the tail vein. At
the time points of 2, 22, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h, groups were
terminated by euthanizing the animals, and the tumor, blood, liver,
and kidney were resected, weighed, and the radioactivity measured
on a gamma counter. Data were corrected for decay, tissue weight,
and the injected amount of radioactivity.

Tissue Uptake of PeptoBrush 1, Peptobrush 3, and PeptoBrush 4
CT26 tumor-bearing
animals were divided into groups based on their tumor volume (mean
tumor volume of = 180 ± 72 mm3, n = 3 in each group) and were administered with either 100 or 500
μg of PeptoBrush 1, PeptoBrush 3,
or PeptoBrush 4. After 72 h, mice were administered with
[111In]20 (100 μg, ∼25 MBq, 100
μL, with an apparent Am of 0.9 GBq/μmol;
500 μg, ∼13 MBq, apparent Am = 3.0 GBq/μmol) through the tail vein. They were euthanized
22 h p.i. (or subsequently following the 22 h scan), tissue was resected
and weighed, and the radioactivity measured on a gamma counter. Data
were corrected for decay, tissue weight, and injected amount of radioactivity.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
in GraphPad Prism 8. The tumor uptake achieved using different PeproBrushes
as primary targeting agents were compared with one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s posthoc test. All statistical results
were considered significant when the p value was
<0.05.
