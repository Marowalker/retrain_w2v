We employ atomically
resolved and element-specific scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) to visualize in situ and
at the atomic scale the crystallization and restructuring processes
of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films.
To this end, we deposit a model heterostructure of thin amorphous
MoS2 films onto freestanding graphene membranes used as
high-resolution STEM supports. Notably, during STEM imaging the energy
input from the scanning electron beam leads to beam-induced crystallization
and restructuring of the amorphous MoS2 into crystalline
MoS2 domains, thereby emulating widely used elevated temperature
MoS2 synthesis and processing conditions. We thereby directly
observe nucleation, growth, crystallization, and restructuring events
in the evolving MoS2 films in situ and
at the atomic scale. Our observations suggest that during MoS2 processing, various MoS2 polymorphs co-evolve
in parallel and that these can dynamically transform into each other.
We further highlight transitions from in-plane to out-of-plane crystallization
of MoS2 layers, give indication of Mo and S diffusion species,
and suggest that, in our system and depending on conditions, MoS2 crystallization can be influenced by a weak MoS2/graphene support epitaxy. Our atomic-scale in situ approach thereby visualizes multiple fundamental processes that
underlie the varied MoS2 morphologies observed in previous ex situ growth and processing work. Our work introduces
a general approach to in situ visualize at the atomic
scale the growth and restructuring mechanisms of 2D transition-metal
dichalcogenides and other 2D materials.

==== Body
Atomically
resolved in situ observations of the growth and structural
evolution
of two-dimensional (2D) materials during realistic processing remain
a difficult challenge by (scanning) transmission electron microscopy
((S)TEM). Two factors contribute to this: First, many 2D materials
require a solid growth support with a thickness that impedes electron
transparency. This often restricts in situ (S)TEM
experimentation to cross-sectional sample arrangements1 and precludes potentially more informative plan view sample
geometries under the electron beam (e-beam). Second, growth of many
2D materials, via for instance, chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, requires temperatures
and gas pressures that can be challenging to achieve in (environmental)
(S)TEM.2−4

Addressing both points, we here provide an
approach to achieve
atomically resolved and element-specific in situ STEM
plan view imaging of the crystallization and restructuring processes
in 2D materials, shown here for the important 2D transition-metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). To this
end, we fabricate a model heterostructure system by depositing ultrathin
amorphous MoS2 (a-MoS2) films on graphene membranes,
which act as ideal STEM supports.5 When
these model samples are imaged in STEM we notably find that the energy
input6 from the scanning e-beam emulates
MoS2 processing at elevated temperature (such as occurring
in CVD, PVD, or general annealing treatments), leading to e-beam-induced
crystallization and restructuring of the MoS2. By this
approach of using the STEM e-beam to both probe and modify the material,
we directly follow how a-MoS2 films crystallize and restructure
to nanocrystalline MoS2 (nc-MoS2) domains and
thereby explore in situ and at the atomic scale the
richness of MoS2’s structural evolution via multiple polymorphs.

The importance of MoS2 stems from the current interest
to use this material as a device active layer in low-dimensional (opto-)electronics7 as well as a potent catalyst in (photo)electrochemical
energy applications, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).8−10 All of these application fields share the key prerequisite of scalable
synthesis of MoS2 with controlled properties. The desired
structural characteristics of MoS2 in electronic and catalytic
applications vary however drastically: For electronics, semiconducting
MoS2 with precisely controlled layer number, large crystals,
and a low defect density is desired in order to achieve, for example,
high current on/off ratios and high carrier mobilities in field effect
transistor (FET) MoS2 devices.7 In stark contrast, for (electro-)catalytic applications such as
HER typically finely nanostructured or even amorphous MoS2 with good electrical conductivity, a large specific surface area
and a large number of pronounced defects and edge sites are desired,
since these imperfections rather than a highly crystalline basal plane
are considered as electrocatalytically active sites.8,11

Important in this context, MoS2 occurs in multiple
polymorphs:
First on the monolayer level, the arrangement of the three covalently
bonded atomic sublayers (S–Mo–S) within a MoS2 monolayer can principally show trigonal prismatic (commonly termed
“2H monolayer”, also often referred to as “1H
monolayer”) or octahedral (termed “1T monolayer”)
symmetries.12−15 Importantly, the more commonly found 2H monolayers are semiconducting,
while the comparatively metastable 1T monolayers are metallic, implying
a key influence of MoS2 monolayer symmetry on the material’s
application profile. Second, when individual monolayers of a given
symmetry type are stacked upon each other by van der Waals interactions,
multiple stacking arrangements are possible, which in turn impact
on optoelectronic properties. For instance, for the 2H monolayer type,
several stacking arrangements are possible, where the most commonly
occurring equilibrium types are 2H (AA′ stacking) and 3R (ABC
stacking).16−20 Importantly beyond the equilibrium 2H and 3R stacking, also more
complex nonequilibrium stacking sequences including homonuclear stacking
(e.g., AA) have been reported.17 With increasing layer number, the possible complexity
of these layer arrangements generally increases, since different stacking
types can also co-exist within multilayers,17,19,21,22 let alone
given the further additionally complex possibility of different monolayer
types (2H/1T) stacking onto each other. This polymorphism of MoS2 in both monolayer type and multilayer stacking opens a complex
parameter space of possible layered MoS2 structures which
require control in any synthesis route.

The key methods to realize
MoS2 layers are CVD (including
solid metal/vapor sulfurization methods),23−28 PVD (e.g., sputter deposition
or evaporation),29−34 and wet chemical synthesis.10,35 Important in this context
is that, unlike other key 2D materials (such as graphene1 or hexagonal boron nitride36), MoS2 does not require a metallic process catalyst
to grow and crystallize. Also MoS2 growth can be achieved
already at comparatively low temperatures (∼400 °C). Based
on this comparatively facile crystallization of MoS2, CVD-type
synthesis is most promising for electronic-grade MoS2,
while PVD and wet chemical synthesis offer a high degree of control
over nanostructured electrocatalytically active MoS2. While
the various MoS2 synthesis techniques comprise completely
different formation environments, precursors, constituent species
fluxes, and significantly different growth kinetics, all techniques
nevertheless routinely employ elevated temperature treatments (∼400
°C) at some stage during growth or postprocessing in order to
stabilize a certain MoS2 structure. Therefore, in all synthesis
routes of MoS2 the structural mechanisms proceeding at
elevated temperatures such as nucleation, sustained growth, crystallization,
and restructuring are of fundamental importance. Yet, at present little
work has been done to elucidate these mechanisms.11,37−40 In particular, in situ observations of growth,
crystallization, and restructuring processes in MoS2 and
other TMDCs at the atomic scale are critically missing. This results
in a limited understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying
synthesis and processing, thereby hindering rational synthesis and
postgrowth process development for MoS2.

Our here
presented approach for atomically resolved in
situ STEM imaging of MoS2 crystallization and
restructuring therefore contributes to such much needed understanding
by directly identifying various mechanistic growth and restructuring
steps: In particular we observe, depending on the initial thickness
of a-MoS2 deposited, in-plane crystallization toward few-layer
nc-MoS2 with layers parallel to the support for thin a-MoS2 films, while comparatively thicker a-MoS2 films
evolve into a two-segment nc-MoS2 film morphology with
interfacial in-plane MoS2 layer crystallization parallel
to the support and with perpendicular MoS2 layering farther
away from the support. Our data reveal that during this crystallization
and restructuring various MoS2 polymorphs co-evolve in
parallel. Importantly, we find that these polymorphs dynamically transform
into each other during processing, driven via diffusion
of Mo and S species and, depending on conditions, influenced by a
weak MoS2/graphene heterostructure support epitaxy. Contextualizing
these in situ observations with recent ex
situ MoS2 growth and processing literature, our
work visualizes in situ and at the atomic scale the
multiple fundamental structural processes occurring in parallel under
widely used ex situ MoS2 processing conditions.
Notably, our insights are based on a model system and a STEM environment
that is readily extendable to in situ studies of
other TMDCs and 2D materials.

Results and Discussion
We fabricate
a-MoS2 samples for high-resolution STEM
by sputter deposition of ultrathin PVD MoS2 films directly
onto free-standing monolayer CVD graphene membranes. The graphene
membranes, which act as a ultrathin and light support for STEM,5 were suspended across the holes of a holey carbon
support foil of a TEM grid by a polymer-free transfer process which
ensures an as clean as possible MoS2-graphene interface.36,41−43 During PVD of MoS2 onto the graphene-covered
TEM grids, the samples were not intentionally heated leading to deposition
of a-MoS2.34 MoS2 film with nominal thicknesses ranging from ∼2 nm to ∼10
nm were deposited. For further details on experimental methods, see
the Methods section.

Figure 1a shows
a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM image series (60 kV electron
acceleration voltage) of a nominally ∼2 nm-thick MoS2 film on a graphene monolayer during its structural evolution as
a function of continuous e-beam scanning time (time stamps indicated
in Figure 1; sample
was not intentionally heated during STEM imaging). As apparent from
the initial image at 0 min, the ∼2 nm MoS2 in its
as-deposited state does not homogeneously cover the graphene support
but shows a morphology of interconnected islands (bright regions in Figure 1) with bare graphene
areas in between (dark regions in Figure 1). The STEM image at 0 min also gives the
visual impression of an amorphous structure in the MoS2 deposit. This is corroborated by the Fourier transform (FT) data
in Figure 1b for 0
min, which only shows a broad halo indicative of amorphicity. Upon
continued scanning of the e-beam over the field of view of Figure 1a, the appearance
of the MoS2 islands gradually changes: The visual impression
suggests gradual island restructuring resulting in (i) crystallization
of the amorphous MoS2 islands toward nc-MoS2 with the MoS2 layers parallel to the graphene support
as well as (ii) slight “dewetting” of the MoS2 from its support. Corroborating a-MoS2 crystallization,
after 8 min e-beam exposure not only the visual appearance in the
STEM data (Figure 1a) but also the FT data in Figure 1b suggest some e-beam-induced crystallization of the
MoS2 as a more pronounced ring in the FT pattern has emerged.
The emerging ring corresponds well to the 2H MoS2 (010)
reflection (∼0.26 nm), consistent with 2H MoS2 crystallization
with layers parallel to the support. After 17 min of continuous e-beam
scanning, the FT in Figure 1b has even developed signs of one discrete hexagonal spot
pattern (indicated by white arrows). This suggests an emerging dominant
crystalline 2H MoS2 layer orientation across the entire
field of view in Figure 1a (17 min). Interestingly, we find that the e-beam-induced crystallization
is a phenomenon highly localized to the e-beam in STEM with a sharp
boundary between exposed crystallized and nonexposed amorphous material
(Figure 2). We note
that such a good spatial definition of the beam-driven crystallization
implies that e-beam exposure could potentially be used to spatially
selectively transform a-MoS2 to nc-MoS2 in a
fabrication scenario.6 Given the lower
chemical stability of a-MoS2 compared to nc-MoS2,34 this may be useful for direct resist-free
patterning of crystalline MoS2 devices where nonexposed
a-MoS2 could be chemically etched away with the more stable
crystalline MoS2 remaining.

summarizing the observations deduced from (a).

Figure 2 HAADF STEM image of the ∼2 nm MoS2 on graphene
corresponding to Figure 1a. In the lower half of the image the MoS2 has been exposed
to 18+ min of continuous e-beam scanning, leading to crystallization
of the initial a-MoS2 to nc-MoS2 domains. In
contrast, in the upper half of the image the MoS2 has not
been previously e-beam exposed, therefore remaining in its as-deposited
a-MoS2 state. The sharp boundary between the a-MoS2 and the nc-MoS2 (dotted white line) indicates
that the e-beam-induced crystallization is a phenomenon highly localized
to the area exposed to the e-beam with nm-scale resolution.

To complement our STEM measurements,
additional time-resolved bright-field
(BF) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) measurements at electron acceleration voltages
from 60 kV to 200 kV are presented in Supporting Information Figures S1–S3. Figure S1 (80 kV) corroborates at a wider field of view in the TEM
(up to 900 nm) the e-beam-induced restructuring and crystallization
of our ∼2 nm a-MoS2 films to nc-MoS2 with
2H MoS2 layers parallel to the graphene support, consistent
with our STEM data. Figure S2 (60 kV, same
electron acceleration voltage as used in STEM) shows similar e-beam-induced
crystallization at 60 kV and reveals via time-dependent
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements that the S/Mo
ratio in the films during their e-beam-induced transition from a-MoS2 to nc-MoS2 only slightly drops from S/Mo0 min = 2.1 ± 0.03 to S/Mo20 min = 2.0 ± 0.03.
This suggests that the loss of S via e-beam-induced
sputtering processes in our MoS2-graphene heterostructures
in particular at 60 kV can remain limited, consistent with previous
literature.44,45Figure S3 (80 kV vs 200 kV) finally confirms that a-MoS2 crystallization is also observed for 200 kV electron acceleration,
whereby we find that the rate of a-MoS2 crystallization
for 80 kV and 200 kV appears roughly similar, while in contrast the
degradation rate of the graphene support is much more pronounced at
200 kV due to much increased electron knock-on damage to the graphene.46 Overall and most importantly, our TEM data in Figures S1–S3 confirm that the observed
e-beam-induced a-MoS2 crystallization is a generic processes
independent of our particular employed microscope type (i.e., STEM or TEM; note that one STEM and two different
TEM systems were found to give consistent results, see Methods section) and is working over a wide range of typical
(S)TEM electron acceleration voltages and imaging parameters, making
our model heterostructures an easily implemented in situ imaging platform.

Figure 1c schematically
illustrates our observations of this e-beam-induced crystallization
and restructuring of initial a-MoS2 clusters to nc-MoS2 of a few layers thickness with MoS2 planes parallel
to its graphene support. Atomic-scale in situ work
on MoS2 has to date primarily concentrated on the formation
of defects in and amorphization of initially fully crystalline MoS2 monolayers,44,47−50 that is, the reverse process
of the a-MoS2 crystallization observed here and on phase
transitions (e.g., 2H to 1T) in
fully crystalline MoS2.13 In
contrast, crystallization of a-MoS2, as followed here at
the atomic scale, has previously been studied only at comparatively
large fields of view, insufficient to discern details on the single
atom level, be it in or ex situ from
thermal activation11,37−40,51,52 or e-beam irradiation.39,52−54 In contrast to previous work, our high-resolution
STEM data now allow us to discuss atomic-scale details of the crystallization
and restructuring processes based on direct in situ information.

To quantify the HAADF STEM intensity data from Figure 1a, we show in Figure 3a the central region
from Figure 1a at higher
magnification
after 18 min e-beam exposure. Taking a HAADF intensity line profile
(Figure 3b) along the
yellow line indicated in Figure 3a allows to identify the nature of the atoms in the
image based on the element-specific intensity of HAADF data of ultrathin
films which has a dependence55 on atomic
number Z of Z∼1.64. We thereby identify the thinnest region in Figure 3a (across which the line profile is drawn)
to be a MoS2 monolayer of 2H monolayer structure12,13 (Figure 3b inset).
Consistently this region displays a 6-fold FT (inset of Figure 3a) with distances of ∼0.26
nm and ∼0.15 nm corresponding to the (010) and (110) reflections
of 2H MoS2, respectively. Based on this identification
of a 2H monolayer MoS2 region, we recalculate the HAADF
intensity counts in Figure 3a to a relative intensity with respect to the HAADF intensity
from a single S atom as shown in the false color coded image in Figure 3c, in which a single
S atom (ZS = 16) has relative intensity
1 and a single Mo atom (ZMo = 42) has
a relative intensity of ∼4.9. In doing so we establish a straightforward
way of identifying the structure of further MoS2 regions
in our in situ STEM data. For increasing layer numbers,
the spatial average intensity over a region scales approximately linearly
with number of layers. The atomic stacking type in such multilayers
can then in turn be discerned by further analyzing the spatially resolved
intensities as a function of atomic positions. For instance, the region
left of the monolayer patch in Figure 3c is thereby consistent with a 2H bilayer, as indicated
in the image. Furthermore, in Figure 3c several isolated Mo atoms can be identified on the
graphene support (see labeled examples) as well as one Mo adatom on
the 2H bilayer patch (correspondingly labeled).

line in (a) for which HAADF intensity has been normalized to the intensity

Following this method, we present in Figure 4 the recalculated data from the time series
in Figure 1 and identify via the spots (a) to (g) labeled in Figure 4 three salient structural evolution processes
that we find to occur in parallel in this image series. Additional
HAADF STEM time series data in Figure 5 for two other regions on a ∼2 nm MoS2 on graphene sample show a matching evolution. Importantly, for Figure 5a,b we also provide
the corresponding HAADF STEM in situ videos taken
during the continuous e-beam exposure (temporal resolution ∼2.7
s per frame) as Video S1 and Video S2, respectively.

evolutions discussed in the main text.

∼2.7 s per frame) for (a) and (b) are given in Video S1 and Video S2, respectively (time lapsed to 4 frames per second, time stamps indicated
for salient frames in the videos).

In Figure 4 spots
(a) and (b) we follow the structural evolution that we most commonly
observe upon e-beam-induced crystallization: An initially amorphous
region crystallizes into bilayer patches of 2H MoS2.16 In particular, for spot (a) we observe after
3 min nucleation of a 2H bilayer patch in the upper right. This region
has expanded after 8 min, whereupon at 14 min, two more nonconnected
2H bilayer regions appeared in the lower left and lower right of spot
(a). From 8 to 15 min, these regions restructure, including some intermittent
shrinking, and before 17 min, the 2H bilayer patches have expanded
into one connected single crystalline grain. This grain in spot (a)
at 17 min covers ∼5.7 nm2, which is the largest
connected single crystalline grain imaged in Figures 1 and 4. A similar
evolution is also found in Figure 5 and Video S1 and Video S2: In Figure 5a/Video S1, a
small 2H bilayer nucleus near the center of the image grows in lateral
size at the expense of surrounding amorphous MoS2 deposits
on the graphene. In Figure 5b/Video S2, a 2H monolayer is observed
in the center of the frame with an adjacent largely amorphous bilayer
region to the upper right. Upon continued e-beam exposure, this amorphous
bilayer region crystallizes into a larger 2H bilayer grain.

This generally observed preferential formation of the 2H phase
from a-MoS2 confirms previous formation energy calculations
of various MoS2 bulk polymorphs that predicted 2H to be
the energetically most favored structure.11,18 Since in our ultrathin MoS2-graphene heterostructures
thermodynamic bulk properties may be modified by effects from heterogeneous
interfaces and free surfaces etc.,56 we model in Figure S4 nonbulk
representations of heterostructures of a-MoS2 on graphene
in comparison to a crystalline 2H MoS2 bilayer patch on
graphene and calculate their formation energies using density functional
theory (DFT). From our calculations, we find the crystalline 2H bilayer
MoS2 patch on graphene to be between ∼0.26 eV/atom
and ∼0.34 eV/atom lower in formation energy than the corresponding
a-MoS2 on graphene. This suggests (in general agreement
with previous bulk calculations)11,18 also for our
ultrathin MoS2-graphene heterostructures that a thermodynamic
driving force is behind the experimentally observed crystallization
of a-MoS2 to 2H MoS2, whereby we hypothesize
that the energy input6 from the scanning
e-beam is helping to overcome kinetic barriers57 to crystallization.

In contrast to this theoretically
predicted evolution of our a-MoS2 toward 2H, we however
find in Figure 4 in
spot (c) in the lower right at 17 min
a crystalline MoS2 region to have evolved from initial
a-MoS2 that has a spatial average intensity consistent
with bilayer, but where the intensities as a function of atomic positions
indicate that this bilayer patch is not of the 2H
type. Instead the measured atomically resolved intensity profile of
spot (c) at 17 min is consistent with a bilayer that shows homonuclear
stacking (either 2H′ or 1H),17 where
Mo atoms of the second layer are placed directly above Mo atoms of
the first layer. This observation of homonuclear stacking next to
2H stacking suggests that, besides crystallization toward equilibrium
2H, initial a-MoS2 can also crystallize into other MoS2 polymorphs under fixed processing conditions, thereby resulting
in co-existence of several MoS2 polymorphs. While homonuclear
stacking is energetically not favored,18 it has been previously observed ex situ in annealed
liquid-phase exfoliated MoS2 layers,17 where similar to our observation here, equilibrium 2H bilayers
and nonequilibrium homonuclearly stacked bilayer regions co-existed.
We note that this resemblance between our in situ and previous ex situ data implies that our atomic-scale in situ observations are indeed capturing processes which
are relevant to ex situ MoS2 processing.

Besides predominant 2H stacking and homonuclear stacking, we find
after extended e-beam exposure (17 min) also a third salient stacking
type shown in Figure 4 at the spots labeled (d). Compared to the 2H and homonuclear bilayers,
this region exhibits no six-fold symmetry but a line appearance of
different symmetry. Measuring characteristic distances for spots (d)
in Figure 4, we find
this structure to exhibit a spacing of ∼0.23 nm which is comparably
shrunk from the typical ∼0.26 nm distance in 2H MoS2. This structure is thereby reminiscent of merging line defects in
MoS2 layers that result from loss of S under continued
e-beam illumination.50 Such a ∼0.23
nm fringe spacing is also approaching the spacings expected for metallic
Mo phases,58 and the observed line-like
symmetry is also evocative of previously reported S-deficient MoS2–x phases.59 For these reasons we tentatively assign the structure at spots (d)
in Figure 4 to locally
S-deficient MoS2–x, which is created
during our continued e-beam exposure in the STEM by S loss from the
initially present MoS2. This S loss leads to crystallization/restructuring
not toward a MoS2 polymorph but a S-deficient structure,
akin to recent results on e-beam-induced S-deficient phase formation
in SnS2.60 We note that controlled ex situ formation of such S-deficient MoS2–x has previously been suggested to be beneficial for
certain applications requiring 2D Mo–S compounds with increased
reactivity.61 We also note however that
our EDX measurements in the TEM in Figure S2, discussed above, as well as the observation in Figure 4 that globally the 2H MoS2 phase is the predominant phase suggests that on a larger
scale, the loss of S is limited at 60 kV for our in situ crystallization conditions.

Having established the three salient
Mo–S structures in
our data, we note that the observed MoS2 crystallization
and restructuring processes under the e-beam are found to be highly
dynamic: Notably, in spot (e) in Figure 4 (corresponding also to the region shown
in Figure 3), the small
bilayer-thick region toward the left in Figure 4/spot (e) evolves from an amorphous island
with approximate bilayer thickness (0 min) to a crystalline bilayer
with 2H stacking (14 min). This 2H bilayer then intermittently evolves
to homonuclear bilayer stacking (15 min) only to then return to 2H-type
stacking (17 min and 18 min in Figure 3). This time-dependent appearance/disappearance of
MoS2 polymorphs indicates that various polymorphs can not
only co-evolve but also dynamically transform into each other during
processing. Similarly, the in situ e-beam exposure
videos (Video S1 and Video S2, corresponding to Figure 5) indicate a highly dynamic local evolution
during the overall a-MoS2 to nc-MoS2 crystallization,
where in particular the emerging 2H bilayer grains are far from static
but exhibit alternating growth and shrinkage periods. A key question
behind such dynamics is the underlying mechanism of atomic movement.
In this context, currently little is known about the diffusing moieties
in MoS2 during crystallization and restructuring.62−64 This results from the difficulty of their direct observation due
to their presumably fast diffusion speeds.37 While even the best time resolution in our data during the continuous
e-beam exposure in situ videos (∼2.7 s per
frame, as shown in Video S1 and Video S2, corresponding to Figure 5) is insufficient to directly observe diffusing
species, close inspection of our STEM data can give hints of the diffusing
species in our e-beam-induced MoS2 restructuring. We note
that some of the adventitious carbon residues on the bare graphene
areas in Figure 1a, Figure 5, Video S1, and Video S2 can act
as intermediate traps for species diffusing over the graphene, thus
allowing to draw some preliminary conclusions about moieties diffusing
between MoS2 clusters on the graphene: Our element-specific
HAADF data identify isolated Mo atoms on the graphene support (some
examples labeled in Figure 3c and as spots (f) in Figure 4) that change their location and attach/detach from
larger MoS2 structures during the time series in Figures 3 and 4. Such suspected diffusion of Mo atoms between MoS2 clusters on graphene is also consistent with Figure 5a/Video S1 where
we also observe at better temporal resolution in the in situ video multiple instances of positional changes of Mo atoms during
e-beam exposure that lead to overall mass transport from one MoS2 cluster to another across the graphene. An example of this
is the evolution of a “neck” between two eventual MoS2 clusters visible left of the image center in Video S1 (location of forming neck indicated
in Figure 5a/180 s
by a white arrow). Another example is the appearance and diffusional
movement of several isolated Mo atoms in Video S1 below the 2H bilayer cluster (location indicated in Figure 5a/743 s by a white
arrow). As such our data indicate that some Mo mass transport is occurring
between MoS2 clusters across the graphene support during
a-MoS2 crystallization and restructuring. Given the lower
atomic number of S atoms, clear identification of isolated S on the
basal plane of the graphene support next to adventitious carbon adsorbates
is more challenging in our data. We have however labeled as spots
(g) in Figure 4 some
candidates that may be attributed to single S atoms on the graphene
basal plane, which would suggest that also isolated S atoms are diffusing
over the graphene during the restructuring. Besides longer range mass
transport between adjacent grains, a second type
of diffusion during the restructuring is short-range diffusion of
atoms within a given grain. An example of such diffusion
events within a grain is found in Figure 3c where a Mo adatom is intermittently located
on a MoS2 bilayer patch, consistent with a recently identified64 metastable adatom configuration on a MoS2 lattice. The in situ data in Video S2 further shows multiple instances of
diffusional steps and positional changes between adjacent atoms within
a given bilayer MoS2 grain during its crystallization from
a-MoS2 to 2H MoS2 (location indicated by white
arrow in Figure 5b/190
s). Thereby our data show that such short-range diffusion events within
a given grain are another major mechanism of crystallization and restructuring
of a-MoS2 to nc-MoS2.

After close inspection
of atomically resolved information, we quantitatively
analyze the data in Figures 1 and 4 with respect to the visual notion
of a-MoS2 dewetting from the graphene support during its
crystallization to nc-MoS2 on wider scale: The analysis
in Figure S5 shows that for the STEM data
in Figure 1a from 0
to 15 min, the bare graphene area notably increases, while, conversely,
MoS2 regions with monolayer and submonolayer MoS2 coverage reduce and MoS2 regions with bi- and trilayer
coverage slightly increase in area. This confirms the visual impression
that the low coverage a-MoS2 clusters dewet from the graphene
support and the thus released Mo and S attaches on average to thicker
MoS2 regions. Previous theoretical work has predicted (based
on considerations of edge energies and interlayer binding in nc-MoS2 clusters) an increasing equilibrium average layer number
for MoS2 crystallites with increasing lateral size.29 For our data, this would suggest that our MoS2 clusters possibly transform toward their equilibrium thickness/lateral
size ratio by the observed dewetting process via the
energy input from the e-beam.

Our atomic-scale in situ observations during crystallization
and restructuring of MoS2 have so far elucidated two key
points: First, various MoS2 polymorphs can co-exist and
evolve in parallel for fixed processing conditions. This links directly
with previous ex situ reports on in-layer polymorphism12−15 and co-existence of various stacking types17,18,21,22 in ex situ processed MoS2, including chemical synthesis
and CVD. As a second and equally important point, our in situ data now clarify that the structural evolution of the MoS2 leading to such polymorphism is not static but highly dynamic, where
phases appear/disappear and transform into each other over time. Observation
of such dynamics intrinsically requires an in situ approach as employed here.

While in our experiments the monolayer
graphene onto which the
a-MoS2 is deposited onto is primarily employed as substrate
for high-resolution STEM,5 the many emerging
applications of vertical MoS2/graphene heterostructures
in energy, (opto-)electronics, and catalysis10,65−67 make also the properties of this MoS2/graphene
heterostructure interesting as such. A key drawback toward their elucidation via the data presented in Figures 1–5 is however
that the lattice of the supporting graphene is not resolved in these
images due to nonoptimal imaging conditions for the lighter carbon
(ZC = 6) as well as static residual adventitious
carbon contamination which is typical5,36,68 for graphene samples from sample transport and storage
in air. This precludes the assessment of orientational relations between
the underlying graphene and the crystallizing MoS2 in Figures 1–4, despite the interesting observation that after
17 min electron beam exposure, the FT in Figure 1b shows signs of one discrete hexagonal spot
pattern across several nonconnected MoS2 crystallites.
Such a discrete six-fold FT pattern would suggest a dominant orientation
of the crystallized MoS2 that in turn opens the interesting
question whether this dominant orientation may be related to a possible
epitaxial relationship of the MoS2 to the underlying graphene
support. Previous literature suggested that the nonexistence22,69,70 or existence22,71,72 of MoS2/graphene epitaxy is highly
process parameter dependent, resulting from the rather weak van der
Waals interaction between MoS2 and graphene.69 When MoS2/graphene epitaxy was found
in previous work, rotational misalignment distributions peaked at
0° and 30°.22,71,72

To resolve a possible orientation relation between the graphene
support and the crystallizing nc-MoS2 domains under our
conditions, we present the e-beam crystallization sequence in Figure 6a. In this series
the graphene support in as-deposited state (0 min e-beam exposure)
shows both adventitious carbon covered but also atomically clean graphene
areas. In the image center of the latter, the six-fold lattice of
a single crystalline graphene region can be well resolved (inset)
and its orientation can be straightforwardly discerned from the corresponding
FT pattern below the inset. The MoS2 in Figure 6a is fully amorphous in its
as-deposited state, consistent with our findings above. During continuous
e-beam exposure, two processes happen, resulting in Figure 6b which shows the same region
after 35 min of e-beam exposure: (i) Same as in Figure 1, the e-beam exposure leads to crystallization
of the a-MoS2 to nc-MoS2 with MoS2 layers parallel to the graphene support; and (ii) concurrently,
adventitious carbon diffusion into the field of view (typical for
extended STEM imaging)5 obscures the initially
atomically clean graphene area in the center. Nevertheless, the FT
of the nc-MoS2 in Figure 6b now allows to assess the orientation of the crystallized
MoS2 layers. Assuming that the graphene lattice in Figure 6a extends across
the entire field of view (which is a reasonable assumption given the
typically μm-sized graphene domains in such polycrystalline
CVD graphene),73,74 we can therefore by comparison
of the FTs in Figure 6a,b (graphene and nc-MoS2, respectively) measure the misorientation
of the crystallized MoS2 domains and the underlying graphene
lattice. We find for the data in Figure 6 a misorientation of ∼30° which
is consistent with previously reported epitaxial misorientation
values for vertical MoS2/graphene heterostructures.71,72 Combined with the development of one discrete hexagonal spot pattern
over several nc-MoS2 islands across the entire field of
view in Figure 1, this
is indicative that an epitaxial interaction between the graphene support
and the crystallizing MoS2 can also prevail under our STEM
conditions. We note, however, that when considering e-beam-induced
crystallization in TEM at a larger field of view (up to 900 nm) in Figures S1–S3, we find that on the single
crystalline graphene grains rings which are typical of in-plane randomly
rotated polycrystalline nc-MoS2 are produced instead of
discrete MoS2 patterns. Such polycrystallinity over a large
field of view is inconsistent with a strong epitaxial interaction.
The combination of our STEM and TEM results therefore suggests that
the driving force toward MoS2/graphene epitaxy under our
conditions is comparably weak and epitaxy can prevail under certain
conditions (as in STEM) but is easily overridden (as in TEM) by other
factors, leading to epitaxial or nonepitaxial growth depending on
exact processing conditions and kinetics. This is in line with the
process-dependent results on MoS2/graphene heterostructure
epitaxy in previous ex situ reports.22,69−72

Figure 6 (a)
HAADF STEM image of ∼2 nm-thick MoS2 on graphene
before continuous e-beam exposure (0 min). The corresponding FT underneath
(a) is consistent with a-MoS2. The inset in the middle
shows a (medium angle annular dark field) close-up of an atomically
clean graphene area to resolve the supporting graphene lattice and
its orientation by the FT under the inset. (b) HAADF STEM image of
the same location as (a) after 35 min continuous e-beam exposure.
The FT underneath (b) reveals that the a-MoS2 has crystallized
under the e-beam to a single nc-MoS2 grain, which is misoriented
to the graphene lattice directions seen in (a) by a rotation of ∼30°.

Our data of the in-plane e-beam-induced
crystallization have so
far been limited to studying atomically thin a-MoS2 films
(∼2 nm nominal thickness). However, both for electronic and
catalytic applications thicker MoS2 films are also under
investigation.30,34,75Figure 7 therefore
presents time-resolved STEM measurements on comparatively thicker a-MoS2 films of ∼10 nm nominal
thickness. In particular, we are comparing in Figure 7 a region which was partly shadowed during
MoS2 deposition and is therefore of somewhat lower thickness
(darker HAADF signal in the central region of Figure 7a) with regions consisting of the full deposited
∼10 nm nominal thickness (bright HAADF signal at the left and
right edges of Figure 7a). In keeping with our data for the thinner MoS2 films
above, the thin region in the center of Figure 7a shows no in-plane order for the as-deposited
films (0 min e-beam illumination) and is consistent with a-MoS2. Similarly, the thicker regions toward the left and right
edges of Figure 7a
are largely amorphous in their visual appearance in the as-deposited
state (0 min). This is also corroborated by the corresponding FT in Figure 7b (0 min). We note,
however, that on the left side in the thicker region in Figure 7a (0 min), two pronounced lattice
fringes with a spacing of ∼0.6 nm are visible. Such ∼0.6
nm layer spacing is indicative of the (002) layer distance in MoS2, therefore suggesting an image interpretation of MoS2 planes being parallel to the e-beam and thereby being perpendicular to the graphene support.

graphene during continuous e-beam exposure (time stamps indicated).
In particular we show in the image center a region that was partly
shadowed during MoS2 deposition and is therefore of lower
thickness (darker HAADF signal) and compare it with regions corresponding
to the full ∼10 nm nominal thickness on the image’s
left and right edges (bright HAADF signal). (b) FTs of (a) with corresponding
time stamps indicated. (c,d) Close-ups of (a), as indicated by red
frames. (e) Schematic illustration summarizing the observations deduced
from (a).

Upon continued e-beam exposure
we find clear signs of crystallization
for the thicker a-MoS2. As above, the thinner regions of Figure 7a crystallize with
MoS2 layers parallel to the graphene support (22 and 34
min, as also shown at higher magnification in Figure 7c,d). Concurrently and unlike the thinner
films above, in the thicker MoS2 regions, multiple sets
of ∼0.6 nm lattice fringes appear upon e-beam exposure. These
sets of ∼0.6 nm fringes each consist of ∼3 to ∼9
fringes parallel to each other, while the individual sets are rotated
in plane with respect to each other. The appearance of such sets of
∼0.6 nm fringes is a clear sign of crystallization of the initial
a-MoS2 in the thicker regions to nc-MoS2 with
the MoS2 layers in the direction perpendicular to the graphene support. This is also well reflected in the FT data
in Figure 7b (34 min)
that shows the corresponding MoS2 (002) reflections (which
are naturally missing in the FTs of the thin MoS2 which
crystallized with the layers parallel to the support in Figure 1b). The emergence of MoS2 (002) reflections in the ∼10 nm MoS2 films
upon e-beam exposure is also corroborated by TEM measurements at a
larger field of view, shown in Figure S6. Importantly, further inspection of the STEM data in Figure 7a (34 min) and Figure 7d shows that under the ∼0.6
nm fringe sets, an in-plane ordered MoS2 lattice continues.
This leads to the interpretation of the data in Figure 7 that thicker MoS2 regions (∼10
nm nominal thickness) crystallize during e-beam exposure in a two-segment
morphology: The first few MoS2 layers near the support
interface crystallize parallel to the graphene support
(same as the thinner ∼2 nm MoS2 regions in Figure 1) but then farther
away from the graphene support the direction of the evolving MoS2 layer orientation changes for the thicker films, resulting
in further MoS2 to crystallize with its layers perpendicular to their support (i.e., perpendicular to the graphene support and the first
few MoS2 layers). We note that these layers with overall perpendicular orientation may also partly be curved
along their length.37Figure 7e schematically illustrates
the evolution of this suggested two-segment nc-MoS2 film
structure with in-plane crystallization near the support interface
and out-of-plane crystallization beyond for thicker a-MoS2 films. Previous literature has found both parallel and perpendicular
layer growth in thicker MoS2 films depending on exact synthesis
conditions.37,76 Importantly we note that the
observation of our two-segment morphology is in excellent agreement
with previous ex situ studies on annealed PVD MoS2 films,30,77 that is, films that were deposited
and processed under similar deposition condition as ours, in which
the same two-segment morphology was reported.

Conclusions
In
summary, our work provides in situ atomic-scale
observations of the crystallization and restructuring of the important
TMDC MoS2. Our data elucidate the complex evolution of
a material with such pronounced and, as we show, dynamic polymorphism.
Our observations thereby visualize multiple fundamental processes
that are underlying the varied MoS2 morphologies obtained
in previous ex situ MoS2 processing studies.
Our beam-driven in situ imaging and materials modification
approach can be expected to be extendable to several other TMDCs and
2D materials that crystallize equally easily as MoS2 (i.e., 2D materials that can grow without
the requirements for high processing temperatures2 and for a thick process catalyst1). We expect that our here presented in situ methodology
will contribute toward an improved fundamental atomic-scale understanding
of TMDC and 2D materials synthesis and integration processing.

Methods
Samples for high-resolution
STEM were prepared as follows: First
continuous monolayer graphene films were grown by CVD on Cu catalysts74 in a CH4/H2/Ar mixture
at 960 °C.73 The graphene films were
then suspended as membranes by transfer onto holey carbon-foil TEM
grids with regular hole arrays (Quantifoil) using a polymer-free transfer
process,41 which avoids the detrimental
residues36,42,43 typically
associated with polymer-based transfers and thus ensures an as clean
as possible MoS2/graphene interface from scalable processing.
Onto these graphene covered TEM grids, PVD MoS2 (nominal
thicknesses from ∼2 nm to ∼10 nm) was then sputter deposited
from a compound MoS2 target. During PVD, the samples were
left at nominal room temperature (i.e., without intentional substrate heating applied). These conditions
are known to lead to deposition of a-MoS2.34 Throughout and after fabrication, samples were stored and
transported in ambient air.

STEM was measured in an aberration
corrected Nion UltraSTEM 100
at an electron acceleration voltage of 60 kV, acquiring HAADF (80
to 200 mrad) data. The STEM data in Figures 1a, 2, 3a, 4, 5, 6, and 7c,d have been Gaussian
blurred (2 pixel radius) to improve visibility. Typical beam currents
during STEM imaging of ∼30 pA result for spot sizes of ∼1
Å2 in electron dose rates directly under the beam
of ∼5 × 108 e– Å–2 s–1, which in turn equate to average
dose rates of ∼5 × 104 e– Å–2 s–1 for continuous
scanning of a 10 nm × 10 nm area as in Figure 1. For the crystallization series in STEM,
continuous e-beam exposure was achieved via continuous
STEM scanning. We note that for imaging at a wider field of view/lower
dose rates in the STEM, the e-beam-induced crystallization correspondingly
proceeds less pronounced. In order to minimize reactions with residual
gas species during STEM imaging, the employed STEM column leaves the
sample in a vacuum of ∼10–9 mbar during imaging.
During STEM imaging samples were not intentionally heated. Note that
all samples were annealed at ∼140 °C in a vacuum of 10–5 mbar for ∼8 h prior to loading into the STEM
in order to desorb adventitious hydrocarbons and adsorbed water from
sample storage in ambient. We crosscheck by TEM and SAED without preheating
that this low-temperature vacuum bake did not result in any significant
a-MoS2 crystallization. BF-TEM and SAED at 80 kV and 200
kV electron acceleration voltage were measured in a Philips CM200
TEM with the sample in a vacuum of ∼10–6 mbar.
In the CM200 TEM, a wide e-beam was used for imaging and SAED at electron
dose rates (∼4 × 101 e–Å–2s–1) that did not induce
a-MoS2 crystallization. In order to induce a-MoS2 crystallization in the CM200 TEM, the e-beam was focused to achieve
electron dose rates of ∼3 × 103 e– Å–2 s–1.
SAED at 60 kV electron acceleration voltage was measured in a FEI
Tecnai F20 TEM with a vacuum of ∼10–6 mbar
and beam current densities of ∼2 × 101 e– Å–2 s–1 for
imaging/SAED and of ∼1 × 103 e– Å–2 s–1 to induce in situ crystallization. EDX was measured at 60 kV in the
F20 TEM with an EDAX Apollo XLTW SDD system. Elemental quantification
from thus obtained EDX data of the a-MoS2 films was crosschecked
by additional EDX measurements using an Oxford Instruments X-max system
installed in a Zeiss Supra 55VP scanning electron microscope (SEM)
operated at 20 kV that was calibrated against mechanically exfoliated
MoS2 reference crystals. Additional SEM-based EDX measurements
on blanket a-MoS2 films deposited at identical conditions
as the a-MoS2/graphene heterostructures confirmed lateral
homogeneity of stoichiometry of our a-MoS2 films. For details
