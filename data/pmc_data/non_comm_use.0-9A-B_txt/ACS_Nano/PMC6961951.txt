Graphene-based
materials are extensively studied as promising candidates
for supercapacitors (SCs) owing to the high surface area, electrical
conductivity, and mechanical flexibility of graphene. Reduced graphene
oxide (RGO), a close graphene-like material studied for SCs, offers
limited specific capacitances (100 F·g–1) as
the reduced graphene sheets partially restack through π–π
interactions. This paper presents pillared graphene materials designed
to minimize such graphitic restacking by cross-linking the graphene
sheets with a bifunctional pillar molecule. Solid-state NMR, X-ray
diffraction, and electrochemical analyses reveal that the synthesized
materials possess covalently cross-linked graphene galleries that
offer additional sites for ion sorption in SCs. Indeed, high specific
capacitances in SCs are observed for the graphene materials synthesized
with an optimized number of pillars. Specifically, the straightforward
synthesis of a graphene hydrogel containing pillared structures and
an interconnected porous network delivered a material with gravimetric
capacitances two times greater than that of RGO (200 F·g–1vs 107 F·g–1) and volumetric capacitances that are nearly four times larger (210
F·cm–3vs 54 F·cm–3). Additionally, despite the presence of pillars inside
the graphene galleries, the optimized materials show efficient ion
transport characteristics. This work therefore brings perspectives
for the next generation of high-performance SCs.

Electrochemical
double-layer
capacitors (EDLC), also known as supercapacitors (SCs), are devices
that store energy through charge separation from electrolytic ion
sorption on charged electrode surfaces.1 There is a huge interest in developing improved SCs owing to the
urgent need for efficient energy storage devices in mobile applications.2 Porous carbons such as activated carbons (ACs)
are traditionally used as electrode materials due to their high surface
areas and low costs.3,4 In the past decade, important
capacitance contributions from micropores in carbon materials were
discovered in ACs and carbide-derived carbons (CDCs).5−7 Ultramicropores (<1 nm) that were previously thought to be inaccessible
for electrolytic ions exhibit significant ion sorption capabilities.2,8 Extensive studies on materials with tailored pores sizes have revealed
that the electrolytic ions partially desolvate and access pores that
are otherwise too small to be accessible.9,10 Further
analyses using modeling11 and in
situ(12−15) and ex situ techniques16 have shown that the desolvation and confinement of electrolytic
ions in such pores restrict charge overscreening and result in efficient
charge storage. Researchers have consequently explored matching pores
sizes to electrolytic ions as an efficient strategy for improved energy
storage.17,18 However, difficulties in precisely tuning
the pores in traditional carbons along with reliably determining pore
sizes using gas sorption analyses have been major hindrances to swift
progress.2,8

In parallel to ACs, various graphene
derivatives have been proposed
as potential materials for SCs owing to their high electrical conductivities,
large surface areas, and mechanical flexibilities.19 Reduced graphene oxide (RGO), readily prepared from graphene
oxide (GO), is extensively studied as a model graphene-like material.20 RGO displays good power capability but suffers
from low capacitances, as the reduced graphene sheets partially restack
through π–π interactions.21 Various three-dimensional (3D) architectures based on graphene (aerogels,
films, and fibers) are being evaluated to mitigate such restacking
with a focus on tuning the material porosity.22 Exploring the layered structures of graphene derivatives for ion
sorption could be another complementary approach to tuning the material
porosity. The graphitic arrangement with 3.3 Å interlayer separation
in restacked graphene derivatives is too small for ion sorption but
could be tuned with an intercalant to exhibit an expanded layer structure.23−26 It can be speculated that such expanded layered structures could
offer additional ion sorption sites through ion desolvation and confinement
effects as earlier seen with ultramicropores in CDCs.11

Recently, we synthesized a class of reduced pillared
graphene materials
(RPs) with varied interlayer separation using alkyl diamines as pillars
and have investigated their use in SCs.25 This comprehensive study using ions with various sizes showed that
ions could access the interlayer graphene galleries as soon as the
naked ion sizes are smaller than the gallery height (defined by d-spacing). Although this preliminary study has demonstrated
ion-sieving in pillared graphene materials, the observed capacitances
remained only marginally better than RGO with appropriate electrolytic
ions.25 Further electrochemical impedance
analyses have also shown extremely limited ion transport in these
galleries.27 These poor performances probably
arose from excessive filling of the galleries with diamine pillars,
leading to impeded ion transport to active sites.28,29

Herein, we report a substantial and simultaneous improvement
of
both the power and energy densities in pillared materials following
a two-pronged strategy. First, the number of diamine pillars were
systematically lowered for improved ion transport in the interlayer
galleries of RPs. Second, a 3D macroporous graphene hydrogel was synthesized
with this low density of pillars and with a different bulk porosity.
Although pillared graphene materials with diamine cross-linkers were
proposed a decade ago, the nature of the cross-linking is still debated.23,24 Using one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, we confirm the covalent
attachment between diamines and graphene and notably demonstrate that
the cross-linking is similar for materials with different pillar densities
and as well as for the graphene hydrogels. Electrochemical analysis
using various electrolytic ions in SCs led to observation of ion-sieving30 in pillared graphene hydrogels. Ion sorption
in the interlayer galleries of the pillared materials with tuned diamine
pillar content enabled twice the capacitances (200 F·g–1) compared to RGO (107 F·g–1). Low densities
of the gels were overcome by using an ambient drying approach, which
led to high volumetric capacitance values of 210 F·cm–3. The definitive evidence of covalent attachment of diamine pillars
with control over pillar density combined with their stability during
long electrochemical tests (40,000 cycles) brings important perspectives
to research on pillared materials for high-performance SCs.

Results
and Discussion
GO has been extensively used as an ideal precursor
for the synthesis
of various graphene derivatives owing to its abundant oxygen functional
groups.31 The carboxylic groups at the
edges and the epoxy groups distributed on the sheets offer substantial
possibilities for functionalization with organic linkers.32,33 Among others, alkyl diamines are efficient bifunctional groups that
could react with these functionalities and cross-link two GO sheets
to form pillared graphene materials (Ps).17,23 We chose 1,6-diaminohexane (6-diamine) as the pillar molecule due
to the resulting d-spacing (7.8 Å) and the ion
sizes of tetraalkylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TAABF4)
salts (6.8–9.5 Å for the cations and 4.8 Å for the
anions).25 After the initial functionalization
of GO with 6-diamine, the resulting 6-Ps were chemically reduced with
hydrazine hydrate to give 6-RPs (Scheme 1a). Diamine functionalized graphene hydrogels
(6-GHs) were synthesized in a one-step hydrothermal process by reacting
GO with 6-diamine (Scheme 1b).

(a) 6-RPs are synthesized
in two-step process, cross-linking and reduction, and (1) dried in

a one-step process and either (2) freeze-dried or (3) ambient-dried
(25 °C) for 2 days. (c) The graphitic and cross-linked domains
in each of the materials are represented schematically. The selected
materials with chosen equivalents for the electrochemical analyses
are presented here in the digital picture with a ruler for scale (cm).

Despite being synthesized in a one-step process,
the 6-GHs are
sufficiently reduced during the hydrothermal process.34 One equiv. of diamine to GO was chosen as an excess condition
where the 2 Ns in diamine are available for 1 C in GO (see the Experimental Section for more details), and a series
of 6-RPs and 6-GHs were synthesized using X equivalents of diamines
with respect to GO and are named as 6-RP-X or 6-GH-X. “RGO”
has also been synthesized as a control material by direct reduction
of GO with hydrazine hydrate. The synthesized materials were characterized
physico-chemically using various spectroscopic techniques, and the
porosity characteristics were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and gas sorption studies. 1D and 2D magic angle spinning (MAS)
ssNMR spectroscopy was performed using naturally abundant 13C and 15N-labeled materials.

Pillared graphene materials
were proposed in the early 2000s as
interesting GO derivatives that could be readily prepared through
reaction of the surface epoxy groups with nucleophilic primary amines.26 Intercalation studies using diamines of various
alkyl chain lengths have later allowed the tuning of the interlayer
spacing of these graphene-based materials.23 However, the nature of the interaction (i.e. covalent
and/or noncovalent) between alkyl diamines and GO sheets is not clearly
understood. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis has mainly
been used to study the presence of diamine in the pillared materials
(Figure S1).26 Indirect strategies such as swelling through solvent insertion,24 sequential amine reactions,23 and charge–discharge under polarization have been
proposed to test the robustness of the pillared structures.25 Although each of the indirect analyses supports
the assumption of a covalent bond at each end of the diamine, a direct
analysis of the interactions is still lacking. Direct observation
and comparison of 6 RP with RGO through transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) showed ordered graphene stacks in RGO, whereas the stacks in
6 RP appear rugose and non-uniformly aligned, suggesting a chemical
functionalization of the graphene sheets (Figure S2). Further atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses showed
elevated height profile in 6 RP compared to RGO, confirming the growth
of particles in the z direction due to cross-linking
of graphene sheets by diamines (Figure S3). However, these microscopic observations along with the aforementioned
indirect analyses do not provide direct evidence of the nature of
interaction between diamines and graphene sheets. Hence, we obtained 13C ssNMR spectra to detect the amine functionalization of
GO, which was shown to occur via the epoxy groups,35 and investigated 13C and 15N ssNMR spectra to directly study the atomic environments of the
graphene sheets and the nature of interaction with pillar molecules.

13C ssNMR studies were conducted on GO and 6-Ps synthesized
with different equivalents of diamines (0.05, 0.20, and 1.00), as
shown in Figure 1.
These experiments were restricted to 6-Ps rather than 6-RPs as the
fully reduced samples display high electric conductivity, which prohibits
magic angle sample spinning (MAS) ssNMR studies due to resulting problems
in tuning the radio frequency circuit.36 Moreover, as the 6-P samples are already partially reduced due to
the mild reducing nature of the alkyl diamine, large degradation in
NMR spectral quality is already observed for increasing numbers of
equivalents. The 13C NMR spectrum of the GO starting material
shows the presence of C=O from carbonyls (δ(13C) ∼ 150–200 ppm), aromatic carbons (δ(13C) ∼ 120–140 ppm), C–OH from hydroxyls (δ(13C) ∼ 70 ppm), and C–O–C from epoxides
(δ(13C) ∼ 60 ppm) (Figure 1a).32,33,37 After reaction with 1,6-diaminohexane, the 13C spectra
of the 6-Ps are clearly different than that of GO. Additional 13C signals arising from the alkyl chains of the diamine (δ(13C) ∼ 10–50 ppm) and RGO (δ(13C) ∼ 120 ppm) appear. Carbons in the alkyl chains in α-position
to the Ns of the diamines are also seen as a discrete 13C peak (δ(13C) ∼ 40 ppm) in 6-P-0.05. In
6-Ps, signals from the C–O–C epoxides and C–OH
hydroxyls are drastically decreased relative to GO, and the signals
from C=O moieties shift to amide positions (δ(13C) ∼ 150–180 ppm). With a low number of diamine equivalents
(6-P-0.05 and 6-P-0.2), some C–OH and C–O–C (δ
(13C) ∼ 60–70 ppm) functions remain, but
the majority have been removed. These observations suggest covalent
attachment of the amine groups in pillar molecules with epoxide and
carboxylic groups on GO sheets. Still, it is noteworthy here that
a simple reduction step and direct adsorption of the pillar molecule
may also resemble the aforementioned spectral features.

frequency of 400 MHz) using a MAS frequency of 12 kHz. (a) {1H-}13C cross-polarization (CP) spectra (natural isotopic

chemical shift correlation spectrum of 6-P-0.05 synthesized with 15N-labeled 1,6-diaminohexane, recorded at 100 K. Since the
samples with varying numbers of equivalents were chemically reduced
to different extents, consequently requiring different NMR acquisition
times for a high signal-to-noise ratio, the spectra have therefore
been scaled arbitrarily, and no relative quantitative information
can be obtained.

The nature of the interaction
between the pillar molecules and
graphene was thus further investigated using 15N-labeled
diamine as the pillar. The 15N ssNMR spectra of 15N-6-P-0.05 and 15N-6-P-0.2 display three main peaks (Figure 1b): (i) δ(15N) ∼ 100–200 ppm, assigned to N from amides
(formed after reaction of diamine with carboxylic groups on GO sheets),
(ii) δ(15N) ∼ 83 ppm, which notably arises
from N in α-position relative to an aromatic carbon or a C–OH,
and (iii) δ(15N) ∼ 34 ppm, which is from unreacted
amines. The signals at higher nitrogen chemical shifts (δ(15N) > 50 ppm) confirm that the pillar molecule is covalently
grafted, while the peak from unreacted amine reveals that some remaining
pillar molecules are either adsorbed on the graphene surface or are
monografted. It is possible that the unreacted amine from monografted
pillar molecules is able to form hydrogen bonds with functions on
the opposite graphene layer, providing additional (noncovalent) interactions.

To gain further evidence on the location of the grafted pillar
molecules, a through-space (dipolar) 2D 15N–13C correlation spectrum was recorded on 15N-6-P-0.05.
The z-filtered transferred echo double resonance
(TEDOR) experiment38,39 was employed for this purpose,
with short mixing time (1.3 ms) so as to detect only directly bonded 15N–13C pairs.39 The 13C peak from the C–N carbons of the alkyl
chain (δ(13C) ∼ 40 ppm) correlates with the
unreacted amine nitrogen signals (δ(15N) ∼
34 ppm), as one would expect for physisorbed or monografted alkyl
diamines. Clear correlation peaks can be observed between amide nitrogen
(δ(15N) ∼ 110–170 ppm) and amide C=O
(δ(13C) ∼ 165–180 ppm) as well as between
these same Ns and pillar C–N carbons (δ(13C) ∼ 40 ppm) (Figure 1c). This proves that the diamines have reacted with the carboxyl
functions on the GO sheets. Finally, the C–N pillar Cs (δ(13C) ∼ 40 ppm) correlate with the −C–N–C–
Ns in α-position to aromatics or hydroxyls (δ(15N) ∼ 83 ppm), indicating that the diamine has been grafted
to the graphene surface through reactions with epoxides. Overall,
these 2D ssNMR experiments on the pillared graphene materials confirm
the covalent grafting of alkyl diamines to the basal planes and edges
of graphene sheets. Note that 6-GH-0.05 was also examined with ssNMR,
and it exhibits the same 13C and 15N spectral
features as 6-P-0.05 (Figure S4).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained to directly analyze
the layered structures in the synthesized materials (Figure 2a,d). Freeze-dried GO shows
a sharp peak at a 2θ of 13.5°, which relates to a d-spacing of 7.6 Å, indicating a high degree of oxidation
of the oxidized graphite precursor. Upon direct reduction of GO with
hydrazine hydrate, the resulting RGO displays a broad peak at 28°
corresponding to a graphite-like pattern (G), suggesting removal of
oxygen groups and partial restacking of the reduced graphene sheets.40 Diamine functionalization of GO in 6-RPs and
6-GHs results in two distinct diffraction peaks around 25–27°
and 11–13°. The peaks at higher angles correspond to G
stacking and indicate a reduction degree close to that of RGO. The
peaks below 20°, corresponding to diamine intercalation and cross-linking
(CL) of the graphene sheets, shift with respect to the number of equivalents
used.25 With increasing number of equivalents,
the CL peaks of both 6-RPs and 6-GHs systematically shift towards
lower angles (higher d-spacing values). The obtained d-spacing values for 6-RP (Figure 2b) and 6-GH (Figure 2e) initially increase and then saturate at
0.2 and 1 equiv. for 6-RP and 6-GH, respectively. The observed d-spacing values fit well into a chemisorption-type model
and suggest a grafting of the alkyl diamines on the graphene surfaces
instead of a simple physisorption (Figure S5), in line with the NMR data.

and (b) the corresponding d-spacing values of the
cross-linked arrangement (CL) (peaks under dotted line). (c) TGA of
various 6-RPs in the 30–800 °C temperature range at 5
°C·min–1 ramp rate. (d) XRD patterns,
(e) d-spacing values from CL peaks, and (f) TGA analyses
of 6-GHs synthesized with varied equivalents of diamine. The specific
6-RPs and 6-GH chosen for electrochemical studies are highlighted
with a dotted circle.

A closer look at the shape and position of the CL peak reveals
important information about the evolution of 6-RP and 6-GH structures
with different number of equivalents. 6-RP shows relatively sharper
peaks with 1 and 0.2 equiv., whereas increasingly broad and less intense
peaks are seen with lower equivalents. On the other hand, whatever
the number of equivalents, 6-GHs exhibit similar CL peak intensities
and width. Nevertheless, in both materials, lower equivalents of diamine
lead to a lower average d-spacing, probably due to
reduced availability of diamines to react with all epoxides (vide supra). 6-RP saturates at a lower d-spacing of ∼7.8 Å, whereas 6-GH saturates at 8.5 Å
(cf. Figure 2b,e). Moreover, 6-GH saturates faster, at 0.1–0.2 equiv.,
suggesting a relatively higher density of grafted diamines. This evolution
of shapes and the higher d-spacing values in 6-GH
could probably be related to the stronger reaction conditions used
to prepare GHs compared to RPs. A comparison of the 13C
ssNMR spectra of 6-P-0.05 and 6-GH-0.05 (Figure S4a) shows that 6-GH-0.05 consumes nearly all of the epoxides
from the GO precursor, whereas 6-P-0.05 still has a considerable number
of unreacted epoxides. Moreover, the 15N spectra show a
relatively narrow peak for unreacted amine in 6-P-0.05 and a relatively
less intense and broader corresponding peak in 6-GH-0.05 (Figure S4b), suggesting that more amines have
reacted in the 6-GHs and also that those that remain unreacted in
the 6-GHs are blocked in various environments, probably through hydrogen
bonds with the opposite graphene layer. The stronger reaction conditions
used to prepare 6-GHs thus lead to enhanced cross-linking with diamines
and result in higher d-spacing values for same number
of equivalents compared to 6-RPs. These reaction conditions enable
the vast majority of diamines anchored on one GO sheet to find a functional
group on another GO sheet, growing larger cross-linked particles,
which can explain the sharper CL peaks observed for 6-GHs.

The
thermal degradation responses of the materials under N2 are shown in Figure 2c,f. GO displays two distinct weight loss events corresponding
to the removal of adsorbed water below 100 °C and the decomposition
of surface oxygen functional groups around 200 °C. A steady drop
beyond 200 °C is generally attributed to gradual removal of stable
functionalities.41 RGO shows only a slight
weight loss throughout the temperature range, suggesting an effective
removal of oxygen groups in its synthesis. Both 6-RPs and 6-GHs show
a broad weight loss between 300 and 500 °C and a gradual weight
loss similar to RGO. This broad weight loss beyond the boiling point
of 6-diamine (204 °C) is attributed to the removal of nonlabile
6-diamine species.25 Moreover, the absence
of loss due to moisture or oxygen functionalities further confirms
the reduced nature of the functionalized materials. In addition, the
weight losses between different 6-RPs or 6-GHs are smaller for lower
equivalents, signaling a reduction in diamine grafting densities.
Taking RGO as the reference, 6-RP displays weight losses of 20 and
10% with 1 and 0.2 equiv., respectively, whereas 6-GH exhibits 25
and 12% (for the same number of equivalents).

In summary, GHs
and RPs are both cross-linked with alkyl diamines,
are reduced, and are chemically similar despite synthesis under different
reaction conditions. To study the impact of the number of diamine
pillars in the galleries and the bulk porosities on the overall ion
sorption in SCs, we chose 6-RP-1 as the sample with the highest number
of diamine pillars and 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 as samples with similar d-spacing to 6-RP-1 (∼7.8 Å) but with lower
diamine filling contents (Table S1). RGO,
with no CL galleries, acts as a control sample. The porosity and morphologies
of these chosen materials were analyzed by N2 gas sorption42 and SEM. The tested materials exhibit type II
adsorption–desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop, indicating
the presence of both micro- and mesopores (Figure S6a).43 RGO has the highest specific
surface area (SSA) of 330 m2·g–1, whereas 6-RP-1, 0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 display lower SSA values of 140,
200, and 200 m2·g–1, respectively
(Table S1). Previous reports on pillared
materials have suggested that the pillars inside the interlayer galleries
could sterically hinder gas sorption and render the galleries as closed
pores.29 This could be a plausible explanation
for the lower SSA values of the 6-RPs and 6-GH-0.05 compared to RGO.
Indeed, if the gas molecules were probing the galleries, one would
expect significant adsorption at low relative pressures. Additionally,
changing the pillar density from 1 to 0.05 equiv. would have also
shown changes in the adsorption at low relative pressures. These observations
provide a strong reason to believe that the gas sorption experiments
do not analyze the galleries. Nevertheless, despite such observation,
the applied potential on the electrode during electrochemical processes
has been reported to provide additional driving force for ion sorption
in such galleries.25 The calculated pore
size distributions show a major presence of micropores in RGO and
mesopores in 6-RPs and 6-GH-0.05, respectively (Figure S6b). The expected 3D macroporous network in 6-GH-0.05
might be too big to be probed through gas sorption analysis.22 The comparison of SEM images of 6-RP-0.2 (Figure S7c) and 6-GH-0.05 (Figure S7d) shows a 3D network of large macropores arising
from the hydrothermal treatment. Further, it was, thus, interesting
to investigate the electrochemical performances of these contrasting
pillared materials displaying similar d-spacing but
varying in diamine content and macroporosity; 6-RP-1 (high diamine
content), 6-RP-0.2 (low diamine content), and 6-GH-0.05 (low diamine
content and different macroporosity).

Electrochemical Analyses
Ion Sieving
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed in SC lab cells
to analyze 6-RP-1, 6-RP-0.2, 6-GH-0.05, and RGO. Although the synthesized
6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 have similar d-spacing to
6-RP-1 (∼ 7.8 Å), the two materials were first analyzed
in three-electrode configuration to probe their ion-sieving capabilities.
Various 1 M TAABF4 salts in acetonitrile (AN) with increasing
cation size and a constant anion size were used as electrolytes: ethyl
(TEA+) - 6.8 Å, propyl (TPA+) - 7.6 Å,
butyl (TBA+) - 8.2 Å, and hexyl (THA+)
- 9.5 Å, with BF4– - 4.8 Å.44,45 Earlier ion-sieving investigations under positive and negative polarization
from open circuit potentials (OCV) of ∼0.1 V vs Ag have enabled analyses of anion and cation sorption in SCs.46 6-RP-1 displays rectangular capacitive curves
with smaller ions but distorted curves and reduced currents under
negative polarization when the ion sizes are close to, or higher than,
the d-spacing (Figure S8b). Similar tests with 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 show quasi-ideal capacitive
behavior under positive polarization where the anion is smaller than
the d-spacing in the materials (Figure 3a and Figure S8c). Under negative polarization, both materials show gradual
reduction in currents as the cation sizes approach the d-spacing in the materials. Since 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 both show
a lack of ultramicro-interparticle pores, the observed sieving can
be attributed to the interlayer galleries. Overall, these results
affirm ion access to the interlayer galleries in 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05
and highlight them as suitable materials to study the ion transport
in between graphene layers.

Impedance Analyses
The ion transport dynamics in the
synthesized materials were studied using EIS measurements. OneM TEABF4/AN was chosen as the electrolyte due to its sufficiently
small ion sizes that could access the interlayer galleries of the
pillared materials. Impedance responses were recorded at 1 V and −1
V vs Ag to obtain the distinct anion and cation transport
characteristics, respectively, and the normalized complex plane Nyquist
plots are displayed in Figure 3b and Figure S9a. These plots can
be divided into three regions of high, medium, and low frequencies.47,48 At high frequencies, only the electrical conductivity of the electrode
together with bulk electrolyte ionic conductivity can be seen; thus,
SC electrodes behave like a resistor (Z′′
= 0). At low frequencies, a sharp increase of the imaginary part of
the impedance (−Z′′), related
to capacitive behavior, is seen. The intermediate 45° region
is associated with the electrolyte resistance arising from ion transport
in the porous network of the electrode. At 1 V vs Ag, the pillared materials and RGO display similar capacitive-like
Nyquist curves and indicate comparable anion transport behavior (Figure S9a). A closer look at the high-frequency
region (inset) shows a slightly longer 45° region for 6-RP-1
compared to others. The slight differences of ion transport are more
obvious under −1 V vs Ag when the larger TEA+ cations are involved. At −1 V vs Ag,
6-RP-1 exhibits a large 45° region in the medium frequency range
compared to the others (Figure 3b), signaling higher ion transport resistance. 6-RP-0.2 and
6-GH-0.05, which possess a low number of diamine pillars, show significantly
improved ion transport with a smaller 45° region than 6-RP-1.
This difference in ion transport highlights the merits of having fewer
pillars. Interestingly, 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 seem to show similar
curves despite their differences in material macroporosity.

The obtained Nyquist plots give an idea about the relative impedances
of the materials but are difficult to use to extract information about
frequencies. The Complex Capacitance model, reported by Taberna et al.49 and derived from Cole
and Cole,50 provides an easier way of studying
frequency responses of the materials. The real and imaginary parts
of the capacitance, defined as C′(w) and C′′(w) in eqs 1 and 2, respectively, represent the available stored energy
with respect to frequency and energy losses during the charge storage,
respectively. Z′(w) and Z′′(w) are the real and imaginary parts of impedance Z(w), where w is the frequency. 1   2  As C′′ represents
the irreversible losses in a SC, we studied C′′(w) with respect to Z′(w) (Figure 3c and Figure S6b). Such an analysis relates energy
losses to the impedance in various frequency regions and also enables
an easier determination of the distinct ionic resistances (Ri) in the materials.25,27 The C′′(w) vsZ′(w) plots
at 1 V vs Ag show clear differences between 6-RP-1
and the other materials (see Figure 3c and Figure S9b). 6-RP-1
displays a broader curve and a maximum imaginary capacitance that
occurs at higher resistances compared to RGO, 6-RP-0.2, and 6-GH-0.05.
With the larger TEA+ cation at −1 V vs Ag, the maximum imaginary capacitance of 6-RP-1 shifts to even higher
resistances (see Figure 3c). The Ri values at both potentials
were readily obtained from the C′′(w) vsZ′(w) curves and are shown in Figure 3d. Ri values
for 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 are between 6 and 12 mΩ·g under
1 V and −1 V, whereas 6-RP-1 displays higher Ri values of 15 and 20 mΩ·g, respectively. These
quantified ionic resistances highlight the impact of the number of
pillars on the ion transport inside the galleries. Importantly, Ri values obtained for the pillared materials
with lower numbers of equivalents (6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05) are closer
to that of RGO, which has no cross-linked galleries. This demonstrates
the significance in optimizing these pillared materials.

The
imaginary C′′(w) vsw curves have a maximum at
a frequency f0 that defines the transition
between purely resistive and capacitive behaviors of a SC (see Figure S10a,b). This frequency, known as the
knee frequency, defines the time constant (τ0) as
the minimum time required to extract half of the capacitance from
a SC.49 The τ0 values
of a SC depend on the combination of all the ionic, electrical, and
cell resistances. 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 exhibit τ0 values of 5 and 7 s, respectively, under both polarizations and
are close to that of RGO (5 s). 6-RP-1 shows high values of 13 and
17 s under negative and positive polarization, respectively (see Table S2). These low τ0 values
for 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 are highly linked to the improved ion transport
dynamics, thanks to the lower the number of pillars in the galleries,
and indicate better power capabilities in SCs. The real C′(w) vsw curves provide an estimation of the available energy stored in the
synthesized materials (Figure S10c,d).
The maximal C′(w) values
for 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 under both polarizations are nearly two
times larger than that of 6-RP-1. The low number of pillars probably
gives access to additional active sites inside the interlayer galleries
that were previously inaccessible, leading to higher capacitances.
Notably, the C′(w) values
of 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 are also twice that of RGO. Since RGO does
not have any cross-linked galleries, this difference could be attributed
to an increased number of adsorption sites inside the cross-linked
galleries of 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05.

This EIS analysis clearly
indicates the role of pillars in the
ion transport dynamics in these materials. Based on the understanding
provided above, Scheme 2 illustrates the improved ion transport and ion sorption capabilities
in the pillared materials with fewer pillars. The τ0 and Ri values of the optimized 6-RP-0.2
and 6-GH-0.05 account for the improved ion transport compared to 6-RP-1
and are similar to that of RGO. This highlights the importance of
fine-tuning the number of pillars in the material to efficiently control
the ion transport as well as to increase accessibility to adsorption
sites. Indeed, ion sorption in RGO occurs on the external graphene
surfaces, and not between the sheets (Scheme 2, left), whereas the pillared materials allow
for additional sorption sites inside the cross-linked galleries (Scheme 2, middle and right),
leading to the higher capacitances observed for the latter.

Scheme 2 Schematic
Representation of the Ion Transport in the Synthesized
Materials
Ion sorption in RGO occurs
on the graphene surfaces in micro/mesopores and the ion transport
is relatively easy. In pillared materials, in addition to the external
graphene surfaces, ion sorption occurs in the inter-layer galleries.
The diamine filling density in the galleries regulates the ion transport
in these materials.

Another interesting aspect
of ion transport that was expected to
be elucidated from the EIS studies was the role of additional macroporosity
in 6-GH-0.05 compared to 6-RP-0.2. Instead of an improved ion transport
that one could expect from the 3D percolating network in 6-GH-0.05,
slightly better τ0 and Ri values were actually observed for 6-RP-0.2. We believe that the
two different synthesis procedures for GHs and RPs are responsible
for this. As inferred from the thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA)
and XRD data (vide supra), these two synthesis protocols
lead to different relative pillar densities and also can account for
different electrical conductivities observed for 6-RP-0.2 (180 S/m)
compared to 6-GH-0.05 (100 S/m).

Power Capability and Volumetric
Performances
The observed
enhanced ion transport characteristics were further investigated through
a power capability study. Three-electrode CVs were performed in a
larger electrochemical window of −1.3 to 1.5 V vs Ag (a voltage window of 2.8 V) at scan rates of 0.01–1 V·s–1 (Figure 3e,f) in TEABF4/AN. RGO exhibits 145 F·g–1 at 0.01 V·s–1 and decreases
to 50 F·g–1 at 1 V·s–1, whereas 6-RP-1 exhibits slightly higher values of 170 F·g–1 at 0.01 V·s–1 but shows a
poorer performance of 20 F·g–1 at 1 V·s–1. The observed values for RGO and 6-RP-1 are slightly
higher than those reported earlier using a 2 V window.25 This increase is probably due to electrowetting
of the electrodes in the larger 2.8 V window.51 Upon reducing the number of pillars, 6-RP and 6-GH both show much
improved capacitances (205 F·g–1 for 6-RP-0.2
and 230 F·g–1 for 6-GH-0.05 at 0.01 V·s–1) and power capabilities (90 F·g–1 for 6-RP-0.2 and 107 F·g–1 for 6-GH-0.05
at 1 V·s–1). As previously discussed, this
increase in capacitance when lowering the pillar number is due to
the enhanced ion access and transport to the active sites inside the
interlayer galleries. Furthermore, fewer pillars also reduce the relative
weight of the electrochemically inactive diamine, aiding the overall
specific capacitances. Together, this increased accessibility to active
sites and reduced hindrance to ion motion result in materials (6-RP-0.2
and 6-GH-0.05) with twice the power capabilities of RGO. A comparison
of 6-RP-0.2 and 6-GH-0.05 shows different capacitances but similar
power capabilities. While the relative ion transport kinetics have
been evoked above, the higher capacitance of 6-GH-0.05 compared to
that of 6-RP-0.2 could be attributed to a higher accessibility brought
about by the 3D percolating network in 6-GH-0.05. Overall, the high
specific capacitances of all the pillared materials (with SSA <200
m2/g) compared to RGO (with SSA less than 330 m2/g) confirms that the surface area accessible to ion sorption and
gas sorption is different.

The synthesized pillar materials
offer increased gravimetric capacitances compared to RGO, but they
have low volumetric capacitances owing to their low material densities.
RGO, 6-RP-0.2, and 6-GH-0.05 exhibit 70, 110, and 4 F·cm–3 with their material densities of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.02
g.cm–3, respectively (see Figure 3f). However, the graphene hydrogel (6-GH-0.05)
provides an opportunity to enhance the material density through a
simple ambient drying technique (Scheme 1). A slow evaporation of the water in the
hydrogel is reported to shrink the large macro pores and densify the
hydrogel.52 Hence, we synthesized 6-GH-0.05-AD
(ambient-dried) as a high-density counterpart to 6-GH-0.05; the material
density increased from 0.02 to 1.1 g.cm–3. The XRD
pattern of 6-GH-0.05-AD still shows a CL peak corresponding to the
expected interlayer spacing of 7.8 Å (see Figure S11a), and the SEM images indicate clear shrinking
and densification upon ambient drying (see Figure S12).

Two-electrode symmetrical cells of 6-GH-0.05 and
6-GH-0.05-AD were
fabricated and studied in a 2.8 V window. The CVs obtained at 0.02
V·s–1 in TEABF4/AN show rectangular-shaped
curves with similar current densities for both 6-GH-0.05 and 6-GH-0.05-AD
(see Figure 4a). The
gravimetric power capabilities of the materials from 0.01 to 1 V·s–1 show identical profiles for both materials (see Figure 4b). The close performances
of the freeze-dried and ambient-dried pillared materials suggest that
the shrinking of the macroporous network in 6-GH-0.05-AD results in
negligible loss to the overall ion sorption and ion transport characteristics.
Further EIS analyses of both the samples under a negative polarization
of −1 V vs Ag have confirmed their similar
ion transport characteristics. Nyquist plots and additional analyses
(Ima C vs Real Z and Bode diagrams) from the frequency
responses of both the materials appear identical (Figure S13) and close τ0 values of 7.1 and
7.1 s and Ri values of 13 and 15 mΩ·g
for 6-GH-0.05 and 6-GH-0.05-AD, respectively, were noted. These observed
similarities in ion transport characteristics despite densification
could be attributed to the ambient drying process which shrinks large
macropores into mesopores that are large enough to support facile
ion transport.

Figure 4 (a) CVs of freeze-dried 6-GH-0.05 and ambient dried 6-GH-0.05-AD
at 0.02 V·s–1 scan rate in 1 M TEABF4/AN. (b) Gravimetric and (c) volumetric specific capacitances of
the materials obtained from two-electrode CVs in 1 M TEABF4/AN, performed at 0.01–1 V·s–1 scan
rates.

Upon ambient air-drying, the volumetric
capacitance of 6-GH-0.05-AD
has dramatically increased with respect to that of 6 GH-0.05: from
4 to 200 F·cm–3. Notably, this value is four
times higher than that of RGO, calculated to be around 50 F·cm–3 (see Figure 4c). Cycling of 6-GH-0.05-AD at a high scan rate of 1 V·s–1 for 40,000 cycles resulted in 93% capacitance retention
with nearly 100% columbic efficiency (Figure S14). Additionally, various spectroscopic (XPS, IR, NMR) and electrochemical
analyses performed on the cycled electrodes have confirmed the robustness
of the pillared structure during electrochemical cycling (Figures S15 and S16). The observed volumetric
values are among the best for carbon-based SCs with double-layer charge
storage (see Table S4 for a comparison).53 The straightforward single-step synthesis of
6-GH and the subsequent ambient drying process add further merit to
the current approach compared to others. Additionally, the proposed
pillared materials also provide avenues toward even higher performances.
Improving the type of pillar (e.g. electrochemically
active), the relative content of cross-linked particles compared to
graphitic-like arrangements, and/or trapping redox molecules in the
galleries could be a few such strategies. In addition to the field
of energy storage, the pillared graphene architectures offer great
scope for applications in other scientific fields such as gas storage,
water desalination, and membrane filtration.

Conclusions
Pillared graphene materials were synthesized to mitigate the graphitic
restacking in graphene-based materials by separating graphene sheets
with a pillar molecule, providing additional ion sorption sites for
SCs. The physicochemical characterization of the materials demonstrated
that the pillar molecule acts as a spacer, forming cross-linked graphene
galleries. In particular, ssNMR studies confirmed the covalent nature
of the interaction between the pillars and graphene sheets. Thus,
the synthesized graphene galleries are structurally robust for long
cycle life in SCs. The electrochemical performances of the synthesized
materials in SCs were compared to RGO, which has no pillared structures.
Pillared graphene materials synthesized with an optimized number of
pillars exhibit high specific capacitances of 185 F·g–1 (vs 107 F·g–1 for RGO),
confirming the enhanced electrochemically active surface area. The
number of pillars in the galleries was found to have a significant
influence on the SC performances; a dense filling of the galleries
led to lower capacitances and poor power capability, whereas sparse
filling improved both. These results show that the optimized number
of pillars preserves gallery structures, provides ion access to new
active sites, and offers efficient ion transport pathways. Finally,
pillared graphene hydrogels, synthesized to contain additional 3D
interconnected porous networks, delivered even higher capacitances
of 200 F·g–1 and, once air-dried, volumetric
capacitances of 210 F·cm–3. Overall, covalent
and sparsely pillared structures add encouraging perspectives toward
achieving high-performance graphene-based SCs.

Experimental
Section
Reduced Pillared Graphene Material (6-RPs)
An aqueous
solution of well-dispersed 5 mg·mL–1 GO was
prepared and used as a precursor for all syntheses (details in Supporting Information).54 6-RPs were synthesized in a two-step process of cross-linking with
1,6-diaminohexane and further chemical reduction with hydrazine hydrate.
One molar equivalents of diamine to GO was used as a sufficiently
excess condition providing 2 molar equivalents of N for 1 C in GO.
The formula weight of the synthesized GO was calculated as 13.01 g
from the elemental composition obtained by XPS. Materials with 1,
0.2, 0.1, 0.075, and 0.05 equiv of diamine were synthesized using
75 mL of GO (28 mmol) and 3.27, 0.651, 0.325, 0.243, and 0.162 g of
1,6-diaminohexane, respectively. 75 mL of GO and diamine dissolved
in 75 mL of ethanol was sonicated for 10 min and then heated under
reflux at 80 °C for 24 h while being continuously stirred. The
reaction mixtures were later cooled, filtered through P3 filter, and
washed with copious amounts of ethanol, water, and ethanol again,
sequentially. The obtained product was then dried in the vacuum oven
at 100 °C overnight. The obtained pillared materials were further
reduced by treating with excess hydrazine hydrate at 90 °C for
24 h while being continuously stirred. The obtained reduced pillared
materials were cleaned with an excess of water, dried under a vacuum
at 100 °C, and labeled as the respective 6-RPs.

Pillared Graphene
Hydrogels (6-GHs)
An aqueous solution
of well-dispersed 5 mg·mL–1 GO was prepared
and used as a precursor for all syntheses. 6-GHs were synthesized
in a one-step hydrothermal process using 1,6-diaminohexane as cross-linking
agent. Each synthesis was performed with 15 mL of GO (5.6 mmol) with
1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.035, and 0.025 equiv of diamine using 1.21, 0.242,
0.121, 0.060, 0.042, and 0.016 g of 1,6-diaminohexane, respectively.
Fifteen mL of GO and the required amount of diamine were sonicated
for 10 min and then reacted in a sealed 23 mL vessel at 180 °C
for 17 h. The resulting hydrogel was cleaned with excess ethanol and
water sequentially and freeze-dried using liquid N2 to
obtain 6-GH aerogels. Ambient-dried gels were obtained by drying the
hydrogels at room temperature for 2 days, and the remaining moisture
was removed by heating in vacuum at 80 °C overnight.
