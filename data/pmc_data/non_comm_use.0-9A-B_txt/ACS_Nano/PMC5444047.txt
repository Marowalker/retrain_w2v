The
development of engineered nanomaterials is growing exponentially,
despite concerns over their potential similarities to environmental
nanoparticles that are associated with significant cardiorespiratory
morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms through which inhalation of
nanoparticles could trigger acute cardiovascular events are emerging,
but a fundamental unanswered question remains: Do inhaled nanoparticles
translocate from the lung in man and directly contribute to the pathogenesis
of cardiovascular disease? In complementary clinical and experimental
studies, we used gold nanoparticles to evaluate particle translocation,
permitting detection by high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry
and Raman microscopy. Healthy volunteers were exposed to nanoparticles
by acute inhalation, followed by repeated sampling of blood and urine.
Gold was detected in the blood and urine within 15 min to 24 h after
exposure, and was still present 3 months after exposure. Levels were
greater following inhalation of 5 nm (primary diameter) particles
compared to 30 nm particles. Studies in mice demonstrated the accumulation
in the blood and liver following pulmonary exposure to a broader size
range of gold nanoparticles (2–200 nm primary diameter), with
translocation markedly greater for particles <10 nm diameter. Gold
nanoparticles preferentially accumulated in inflammation-rich vascular
lesions of fat-fed apolipoproteinE-deficient mice. Furthermore, following
inhalation, gold particles could be detected in surgical specimens
of carotid artery disease from patients at risk of stroke. Translocation
of inhaled nanoparticles into the systemic circulation and accumulation
at sites of vascular inflammation provides a direct mechanism that
can explain the link between environmental nanoparticles and cardiovascular
disease and has major implications for risk management in the use
of engineered nanomaterials.

==== Body
The manufacture
of nanomaterials
is growing exponentially and with this so is the potential for human
exposure. The fate of engineered nanoparticles and effect on health
following exposure are largely unknown.1,2 Since manufactured
nanoparticles of different types vary in their ability to cause inflammation
and toxicity in animal studies,3 we may
anticipate heterogeneity in their impact on humans at plausible exposure.
Given the prominent cardiovascular effects of nanosized particulate
matter in air pollution, our limited understanding of the potential
cardiovascular effects of engineered nanoparticles, in particular,
is a pressing concern.4

Air pollution
is a major public and environmental health issue
contributing to up to 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year.5,6 The adverse effects of particulate air pollution on cardiovascular
health have been established in a series of major epidemiological
studies,7,8 and even transient exposure to high levels
of air pollution may trigger an acute cardiovascular event.9 Nanosized particulate matter in air pollution,
such as that derived from vehicle exhaust, remains a major public
health concern.10,11 We have previously demonstrated
that acute exposure to diesel exhaust causes vascular dysfunction,
thrombosis, and myocardial ischemia in healthy individuals and in
patients with coronary heart disease.12,13 Chronic exposure
to particulate air pollution is associated with the development and
progression of the vascular disease atherosclerosis in animals and
man.14,15 While these observations are important,
a major area of uncertainty remains: How do inhaled particles influence
the pathogenesis of systemic cardiovascular disease? Are inhaled nanoparticles
able to translocate into the circulation and directly contribute to
cardiovascular disease?

Inhaled nanoparticles are able to deposit
deep in the lungs where
they induce oxidative stress and inflammation.16,17 It has been hypothesized that inflammatory mediators pass into the
systemic circulation18 and indirectly influence
the cardiovascular system. However, evidence of systemic inflammation
following exposure is inconsistent and rather modest. An alternative
hypothesis is that inhaled nanoparticles penetrate the alveolar epithelium
and translocate into the circulation and directly contribute to cardiovascular
disease.19,20 It has been speculated that these processes
may be accelerated by inflammation, through increased permeability
of the alveolar wall or through assisted translocation within macrophages.21−23 Evaluation of nanoparticle translocation following inhalation exposure
is challenging because of the small size of particles, the low deposited
mass, and the requirement for extremely sensitive and specific methods
of detection. Previous studies in man have been inconsistent due to
leaching of radiolabel from nanoparticles.24,25 While there is no evidence to date that translocation occurs in
man, animal studies have provided more compelling evidence that nanoparticles
are able to translocate.20,26,27 Oberdorster and Kreyling report translocation and accumulation of
particles in the liver.28,29 Whether this occurs
in man and whether those particles entering the circulation interact
with the cardiovascular system is unknown, especially in relation
to areas of the vasculature that are susceptible to disease where
their biological activity is of greatest risk.

Here we use complementary
clinical and experimental studies to
address whether inhaled nanoparticles translocate from the lung into
the circulation. Gold nanoparticles are used as model nanoparticles
that are, available in relevant size ranges, effectively inert for
controlled human exposure and to facilitate detection of low levels
in systemic tissues through specific high-sensitivity techniques.
We hypothesize that inhaled nanoparticles will gain access to the
bloodstream and accumulate at sites of vascular inflammation.

Results
and Discussion
Particle Translocation in Man
Fourteen
healthy male
volunteers were exposed to gold nanoparticles (median primary particle
size of 3.8 nm, present in loose agglomerates of 18.7 nm (geometric
standard deviation: 1.5; Figure 1A,B) by inhalation (116 ± 12 μg/m3; 5.8 ± 0.3 × 106 particles/cm3)
for 2 h during intermittent exercise (Supplementary Figure S1). Gold exposure was well tolerated and there were
no adverse effects on lung performance (data not shown).

24 h (12/14 subjects, 86%). (D) Quantification of gold concentrations

quantification (0.03 ng/g of blood; dotted line) at early time points.
Gray symbols represent values below the limit of quantification, but
above the limit of detection (0.01 ng/g of blood). Data expressed
as median ± interquartile range.

Blood and urine samples were obtained throughout the first
24 h
and at 3 months. No volunteer had gold detectable in the bloodstream
prior to exposure, but gold was detectable as early as 15 min after
exposure in some subjects and was present in the majority (12/14 subjects,
86%) at 24 h (Figure 1C). There was no evidence of a significant time-dependent increase
in gold concentration in the blood within the first 6 h of exposure
(Figure 1D). Gold was
still detectable in blood and urine at 3 months.

Particle Translocation
Is Dependent on Particle Size
To explore if the particle
size affected their ability to translocate,
we exposed healthy volunteers to gold particles with a primary particle
size of either ∼4 nm (4.1 ± 0.6 nm primary diameter) or
34 nm (34 ± 3 nm primary diameter) (n = 10 and
9 volunteers, respectively; Figure 2A,B). Particles agglomerated in the aerosol to a median
aerodynamic diameter of 18 and 52 nm, respectively (Figure 2B). Gold was detectable in
the blood at low levels following inhalation of either size of particle,
although levels of the smaller particle were far greater (Figure 2C). Gold was detectable
in the urine following exposure to 4 nm particles, but not in the
urine of volunteers exposed to the larger particulate (Figure 2D).

stated.

To address tissue accumulation
over a wider range of particle sizes,
we repeatedly instilled mice with 2, 5, 10, 30, or 200 nm gold nanoparticles
(primary particle size). Gold was detectable in the blood following
exposure to each size of particulate. However, the incidence of detectable
gold, and the concentration of gold, in the blood was far greater
following exposure to the smaller particles (Figure 2E). A threshold of particle accumulation
(based on the limit of detection using HR-ICPMS) was observed for
a primary diameter of 10–30 nm. Particle accumulation in the
liver also followed a similar trend (Figure 2F), but gold was only detectable in the urine
following exposure to particles ≤5 nm (Figure 2G).

Accumulation of Translocated Particles at
Sites of Vascular
Inflammation
Given the close association of nanoparticles
with phagocytic inflammatory cells, we wished to explore whether inhaled
nanoparticles accumulate at sites of vascular inflammation. Apolipoprotein
E knockout mice (ApoE–/–) were used as a
well-established model of atherosclerosis and fed a high-fat diet
to accelerate the development of vascular lesions. Intratracheal administration
of gold nanoparticles (diameter 5 nm; BBInternational, U.K.; Figure 3A) or vehicle was
conducted twice weekly for 5 weeks to deliver a total of 110 μg
of gold nanoparticles. Blood and liver samples were taken 24 h after
the last instillation, and the aortic arch and descending aorta were
harvested as areas exhibiting and free from atherosclerosis, respectively.

Instillation of gold nanoparticles was associated with a
mild pulmonary
inflammatory response (Figure 3B). At autopsy, gold nanoparticles were present in the alveoli
and largely contained within macrophages (Figure 4A,B). Gold was detected in the blood of gold-instilled
mice at concentrations of 9.4 ± 1.2 ng/mL, compared with 0.4
± 0.2 ng/mL in vehicle-instilled mice (P <
0.0001; Figure 3C).
Gold also accumulated in the liver (Figure 3C).

The aortic arch from
ApoE–/– mice developed
complex atherosclerotic plaques rich in lipids and macrophage-derived
foam cells. Gold concentrations in the aortic arch were 10-fold higher
in gold-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice (60 ± 24 vs 6 ± 1 ng/g of tissue; P = 0.023)
and exceeded concentrations in the descending thoracic aorta (12 ±
6 ng/g of tissue; Figure 3D). Isolated histological sections of atherosclerotic plaque
from gold-treated animals revealed the presence of clusters of red-purple
granules within foam cells (Figure 4C) similar in appearance to nanoparticles in suspension.
Particulate clusters were seen on transmission electron micrographs
of atherosclerotic plaque from gold-treated mice that were distinct
from commonly demonstrated electron-dense membranous structures (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S2). The presence of particulate
gold within atherosclerotic plaques was confirmed on silver-augmented
arterial sections of gold-treated, but not vehicle-treated, mice using
Raman spectroscopy (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3).

In patients with a recent cerebrovascular accident scheduled
to
undergo carotid endarterectomy, we evaluated particle translocation
and accumulation at sites of atherosclerosis (Figure 6A). Twelve patients were recruited, of which
three were exposed to gold nanoparticles (5 nm) for 4 h under resting
conditions 24 h prior to undergoing surgery. Gold was measurable at
concentrations above the limit of quantification in blood from a single
patient and urine from 2 patients following gold exposure (Supplementary Figure S4). Raman microscopy identified
the presence of gold in the excised carotid plaque of those patients
exposed to gold nanoparticles, but not in those without prior exposure
(Figure 6B,C).

Here we demonstrate that inhaled
nanoparticles translocate from
the lung into the circulation in man, where they accumulate at sites
of vascular inflammation. Particle translocation was size dependent,
with greater translocation and accumulation of smaller nanoparticles.
These observations suggest a direct role of particle size for inhaled
nanoparticles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and provide
a mechanism whereby exposure to combustion-derived nanoparticles and
manufactured nanoparticles may promote atherosclerosis and trigger
acute cardiovascular events.

Evaluation of nanoparticle translocation
following inhalation exposure
is challenging. Nemmar and colleagues previously demonstrated the
presence of 99m technetium (99mTc) in the bloodstream of healthy volunteers
as early as 1 min after inhalation of 99mTc-labeled carbon nanoparticles.24 However, subsequent studies could not replicate
this finding,30,25 suggesting that soluble pertechnate
salts, rather than nanoparticle translocation, accounted for the early
and rapid detection of radioactivity in the blood. We used insoluble
gold nanoparticles as they are a similar size to combustion-derived
nanoparticles, have low biological activity, and have been used safely
in man as a radio-contrast agent and for drug delivery.31 Endogenous levels of gold in biological samples
are negligible,32 permitting reliable identification
and quantification of translocated gold at nanogram levels using high-resolution
inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (HR-ICPMS) and Raman
microscopy.

Our findings suggest that translocation of nanoparticles
into the
circulation occurs rapidly, consistent with translocation via a passive transport mechanism, with a slow incremental
accumulation in systemic tissues. There was no evidence of a time-dependent
increase in gold concentration in the blood, suggesting that while
gold nanoparticles translocate into the circulation, this is balanced
by clearance. Indeed, gold was detected in the urine of almost all
subjects within 24 h at a mean concentration of 35 ± 24 ng/mL.
Based on the exposure characteristics of our first study (2 h exposure
of ∼116 μg/m3 under light exercise), we calculate
the total inhaled dose of particulate to be ∼690 μg.
If ∼80 ng of gold was cleared by the kidneys over 24 h (average
volume of urine collected: 2.4 L containing 35 ng/mL), and, therefore,
if this was the sole route of clearance, we estimate that at least
0.2% of inhaled gold nanoparticles translocated from the lung into
circulation. This estimate is consistent with those derived from pulmonary
instillation of particles in animal models,33,34 and those derived from in vitro–in silico modeling.35 The majority
of inhaled nanoparticles are retained in the alveolar region and are
slowly cleared over time.25 In the present
study, gold was still detectable in blood and urine at 3 months, consistent
with ongoing translocation of gold either through the alveolar membrane
or possibly via the gastrointestinal tract after
clearance by the mucociliary escalator. These findings are consistent
with those of Kreyling and colleagues36,37 who demonstrated
the persistence of radiolabeled iridium nanoparticles in the lung
6 months after a 1 h inhalation in rats, with detectable levels in
extra-pulmonary organs at this time.

The physicochemical properties
of the particle that permit translocation
will have important implications both for environmental particulates
and manufactured nanomaterials. Particle size is one of the most crucial
parameters affecting the biokinetics and subsequent actions of nanoparticles.38,39 Here we demonstrate in man that there is less translocation of gold
particles with a primary diameter of 34 nm in comparison to that of
4 nm particles (∼55 nm and ∼18 nm aerodynamic diameter
of agglomerates, respectively). Our studies in mice exploited the
availability of gold nanoparticles with narrow size distributions
to define more tightly whether a size threshold is present for extra-pulmonary
translocation. Significant translocation into the circulation occurred
only at primary particle sizes below 30 nm, with an inverse association
between size and blood levels below this. Others have shown a size-dependent
association for translocation of nanoparticles into the blood of healthy
rats40 that was balanced with clearance
by the kidneys.41 The current studies suggest
that clearance from the circulation via the kidney
may have a smaller size threshold (<6 nm),42,43 supporting the data of Balasubramanian et al.39 Thus, reliance on estimates of particle concentrations
in the blood alone represents only a “snapshot” of several
processes (alveolar deposition, epithelial and endothelial cell penetration,
particle translocation, clearance via the kidneys,
uptake into other tissues such as the liver, etc.),
each with their own conditions for particle passage or retention.
Particle surface charge41,35 and protein interactions44,45 will also be important to translocation and clearance processes.
Similarly, the ability of the inhaled particulate to induce pulmonary
inflammation could alter translocation rates via increases
in alveolar permeability46 or raised numbers
of alveolar leucocytes that theoretically represent nonpassive carriers
to assist translocation. These pathways are the subject of ongoing
investigations.

The fate of inhaled nanoparticles that translocate
into the circulation
remains to be fully established. Recently, uptake of 7 or 20 nm nanoparticles
in the aorta following prolonged inhalation (15 days) was reported
in healthy rats.39 The potential for engineered
nanoparticles (ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide,
∼30 nm particles) to accumulate at sites of inflammation, including
atherosclerotic plaques, has been considered, but only following intravenous
injection.47 In the present study, we administered
nanoparticles via the lung of a well-validated mouse
model of atherosclerosis. Gold was detected in high concentrations
in the liver, confirming the liver as a primary route of clearance
following translocation. Importantly, nanoparticles also accumulated
at sites of vascular inflammation, but not in nonatherosclerotic blood
vessels. The translocation and accumulation of gold nanoparticles
in atherosclerotic plaque were confirmed in man. While the small sample
size did not permit comparison of the extent of translocation between
patients and healthy controls, Raman microscopy was sufficiently sensitive
to detect particulate gold in carotid plaque. The cellular and kinetic
mechanisms, as well as the particle characteristics, that determine
the way circulating nanoparticles accumulate with atherosclerotic
plaques require further investigation, although rheological conditions
and inflammatory cells are likely to play a significant role in particle
accumulation at sites of disease.

If inhaled nanoparticles are
to alter the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
directly, then particles need to access susceptible sites and have
the necessary physiochemical properties to induce toxicity. Our current
studies required the use of an inert and identifiable nanoparticle,
thus we could not address the pathobiological consequences of translocated
nanoparticles taken up into atherosclerotic plaques. Indeed, repeated
instillation of gold nanoparticles did not increase the size of atherosclerotic
plaques in the carotid of ApoE–/– mice. However,
combustion-derived nanoparticles are known to induce oxidative stress
and promote inflammation, and as such, are likely to directly promote
atherosclerosis should they translocate and deposit in the vessel
wall.17 We cannot address whether the pro-atherosclerotic
effects of exposure to air pollution are due to accumulation of combustion-derived
nanoparticles at sites of vascular inflammation in the present study,
but our observations suggest this is both plausible and likely if
nanoparticles were to accumulate in sufficient numbers. Furthermore,
if nanoparticles accumulate in areas of inflammation elsewhere in
the body, this could have important implications for other diseases,48 the potential for particles to cross the placental
barrier during pregnancy,49,50 as well as the progression
of, and theranostics for, cancer.51

These findings have immediate relevance for the nanotechnology
industry where a diverse range of engineered nanomaterials is being
developed for an ever-increasing number of applications. The fate
of engineered nanoparticles and effect on health following exposure
are largely unknown,1,2 especially in relation to the
cardiovascular system.4 These studies use
gold nanoparticles, a commonly used nanoparticle, and one that is
being developed for clinical therapeutics. However, the biokinetics
we observe here for gold may also extend to other nanomaterials including
those with greater surface reactivity. Different classes of nanomaterials
vary greatly in their ability to cause inflammation and cytotoxicity,
thus it follows that there will be marked differences in their impact
on health in both occupational settings and in the wider community
exposed to nanomaterials. While data are still relatively sparse,
a number of studies suggest that pulmonary exposure to a range of
different inhaled nanoparticles may promote cardiovascular disease.4,52,53 A better understanding of how
nanomaterials cross physiological barriers, and their fate thereafter,
will be vital to allow for a safe-by-design approach for new nanomaterials.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that nanoparticles translocate
from the lung to
the circulation and selectively accumulate at sites of vascular inflammation
in both animal models of disease and in man. These observations suggest
that the fate of inhaled nanoparticles, as well as their size, is
crucial for their potential to affect cardiovascular disease adversely.
A greater understanding of how nanoparticles translocate and accumulate
at sites of disease is of paramount importance for the risk assessment
of both environmental and engineered nanoparticles.

are available in the Supporting Information.

Clinical Studies
All subjects gave their written informed
consent, and the studies were reviewed and approved by the local research
ethics committee according with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Healthy male nonsmoking volunteers aged 18–35 (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were exposed
to gold nanoparticles for 2 h via inhalation, during
intermittent exercise, in a specially built human-controlled exposure
chamber (Supplementary Figure S1A,B). Gold
nanoparticles (∼5 nm primary diameter) were freshly generated
from gold electrodes using a commercial spark generator (Palas CFG1000,
Palas GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). In subsequent experiments, larger
single spherical particles were generated by extending the residence
time in argon via a growth loop to agglomerate particles,
followed by thermal fusing of particles. Following exposure, volunteers
were taken to the adjacent clinical research facility where blood
samples were obtained before and after gold exposure and at predefined
intervals. A 24 h urine sample was also taken, beginning immediately
prior to exposure, from an empty bladder.

Patients presenting
to the Lothian Stroke services with a recent
acute cerebrovascular syndrome (transient ischemic attack, amaurosis
fugax, or stroke) and scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were also
recruited (Supplementary Table S3). Patients
were exposed to gold nanoparticles for two periods of 2 h the day
prior to their surgery, but were not requested to exercise. At surgery,
the plaque was excised intact as part of a standard carotid endarterectomy
and patch angioplasty. The specimen was then snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and transferred to a freezer for subsequent batch analysis.

Animal Studies
All experiments were performed according
to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (U.K. Home Office).

Male apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE–/–) mice were fed a high-fat (21% fat) “Western diet”
for 8 weeks.15 Gold nanoparticles in suspension
(citrate-coated, primary particle size 5 nm; BBInternational, U.K.;
50 μL of 2.3 mg/mL), or vehicle, were administered to the lungs
of mice by instillation twice weekly for the last 5 weeks of feeding
(Supplementary Figure S1C). In experiments
exploring particle size, 2, 5, 10, 30, or 200 nm particles (BBInternational)
were used as above, with the exception that stock solutions were diluted
in order that all sizes were of an equivalent mass concentration (0.8
mg/mL).

Animals were euthanized ∼18 h after the last
instillation.
Blood samples from the vena cava and liver biopsies were taken and
stored in soda lime digestion tubes at −80 °C. The lungs
were cannulated via a small incision in the trachea
and lavaged 3 times with 0.8 mL of sterile saline to collect bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid for measurement of lung inflammation. The aortic arch
area and descending thoracic aorta were cleaned of perivascular fat,
rinsed in saline, blotted dry, and frozen at −80 °C in
digestion tubes. The aortic arch region is used as an area of vasculature
with extensive atherosclerotic lesions of a mixed “complex”
plaque phenotype, whereas the descending aorta is largely free of
atherosclerotic plaques in mice at this end under this feeding regime.15

Quantification of Gold in Biological Samples
using HR-ICPMS
Biological samples were completely dissolved
in aqua regia (HNO3 and HCl; 120 °C) and diluted with
ultrapure water to
a final volume of 10 mL before analysis for gold content using HR-ICPMS
(Element XR, Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany).54,55 For quality control aspects on the relevant ultratrace level, two
reference samples “SEROnorm Trace levels in blood” (supplied
by C. N. Schmidt, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Supplementary Table S4) were analyzed, using two different
batch numbers. The methodological limit of quantification was 0.03
ng/g of blood, and the coefficient of variation was 5.5% for blood
samples run in triplicate.

Detection and Visualization of Gold Nanoparticles
in Biological
Tissues
Samples of the aortic arch for transmission electron
microscopy were fixed for 2 h in 3% glutaraldehyde and postfixed for
45 min in 1% osmium tetroxide. Ultrathin sections (60 nm thick) were
cut from selected areas, stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate,
then viewed in a Phillips CM120 transmission electron microscope.

Biological samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin before
histological processing and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (lung)
or United States Trichrome (arteries). Atherosclerotic burden was
comprehensively assessed, as previously described.15 The carotid artery bifurcation was used to quantify atherosclerotic
burden in gold-treated animals, as brachiocephalic arteries were used
for detection of gold by HR-ICMPS.

Raman spectroscopy was performed
using unstained histological sections
that had been deparaffinized in graded alcohol. Detection of gold
particulate was assisted by conjugation to silver using a LI-silver
enhancement kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.). Tissue
sections were incubated in 50 nM of glycine in phosphate-buffered
saline (pH 7.4; 5 min) to block aldehyde groups in the fixation reagent,
then thoroughly rinsed with dH2O to remove all traces of
phosphate ions from PBS. Silver staining reagents were added for 5
min before washing with water and leaving to air dry.

Detection
of gold within tissue samples was performed by Raman
spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia, Renishaw U.K.). Raman spectra from the
lung tissue sections were collected with exposure time of 60 s and
10% laser power, at 514 nm. Spectra were quantified by transforming
data to area under the curve (spectra) between a Raman shift of 950–1750
cm–1.

Data Analysis
For parametric data
(Gaussian distribution)
values reported are mean ± SEM with differences between groups
analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni posthoc tests
and Student’s t-tests, where appropriate (GraphPad
Prism v6.0a). For nonparametric (non-normally distributed) data, values
are reported as median ± interquartile range, with differences
between groups analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis followed by Dunn’s
posthoc tests and Mann–Whitney tests. ROUT’s outlier56 (Q = 1%, GraphPad Prism v6.0a)
was used to detect the presence of outliers in conditions where normalization
to very small tissue weights (aortic arch and descending aorta) skewed
data sets. P < 0.05 was taken as statistically
significant.
