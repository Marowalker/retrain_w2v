The
coordination-restricted ortho-site C–H
bond activation and dehydrogenative homocoupling of 4,4′-(1,3-phenylene)dipyridine
(1,3-BPyB) and 4,4′-(1,4-phenylene)dipyridine (1,4-BPyB)
on different metal surfaces were studied by a combination of scanning
tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and density
functional theory calculations. The coupling products on Cu(111) exhibited
certain configurations subject to the spatial restriction of robust
two-fold Cu–N coordination bonds. Compared to the V-shaped
1,3-BPyB, the straight backbone of 1,4-BPyB helped to further reduce
the variety of reactive products. By utilizing the three-fold coordination
of Fe atoms with 1,4-BPyB molecules on Au(111), a large-scale network
containing single products was constructed. Our results offer a promising
protocol for controllable on-surface synthesis with the aid of robust
coordination interactions.

==== Body
The C–C
coupling induced
by C–H bond activation is of vital importance in synthetic
chemistry,1−8 especially in aryl–aryl coupling because of the irreplaceable
basic role of aryl groups in various aromatic compounds.9−15 To trigger and accelerate the activation of originally inert C–H
bonds, various strategies have been adopted such as transition-metal
catalysis,16−18 harsh conditions,19 and
metal supports.20−23 Among them, chemical reactions on metal surfaces have drawn intensive
attention in which the metal surface can act as a support and a catalyst
simultaneously. The effectiveness of metal surfaces in chemocatalysis
has been validated in different kinds of reactions,24 for example, Ullmann coupling,25−29 carbene intermediates,30,31 arylalkyne
cyclization,32,33 and Glaser coupling.34,35

However, there are still great challenges such as accomplishing
high selectivity among multiple reaction sites36 and obtaining single-product configurations on the surface.
The most common way to tackle the multisite issue is introducing directing
groups and varying metal surfaces to achieve mono/diselective bond
activation.37 In contrast to regioselectivity,
research aimed at the selectivity of product configuration is rarely
reported. One feasible solution is to bring in an additional driving
force so as to restrict the orientations of precursor molecules before
new chemical bonds are formed. A self-assembly strategy driven by
hydrogen bonds has been proved to steer on-surface reactions selectively.38 The metal–organic coordination can display
particular advantages owing to its intrinsic stability and the accessibility
of metal atoms from either the substrate surface or codeposition.
The robust coordination interaction is expected to generate spatial
restriction on the coupling reaction.39,40 Thus, by designing
proper precursor molecules and coordination systems, it is possible
to achieve a highly ordered system made up by single products.

Herein, we report a coordination-restricted ortho-site C–H bond activation and dehydrogenative homocoupling
of V-shaped and straight bispyridine molecules on different metal
surfaces. Because of the significant spatial restriction effect of
the robust coordination bonds, the configuration of final products
can be selectively controlled and a single-product system can be realized
by utilizing proper coordination interaction and precursor molecules
of highly symmetrical backbone.

Results and Discussion
Pyridyl molecules can undergo dehydrogenative coupling with the
endmost pyridine groups as directing groups. The heat-induced C–H
bond activation and dehydrogenative coupling are liable to occur at
the ortho positions of pyridine groups. Owing to
planar restriction of the metal substrate, two types of positioning
modes (I and II) are anticipated, as shown in Figure 1a. Type-I is characterized by two homolateral
nitrogen atoms, which can coordinate to the same metal atom, while
for type-II, the two nitrogen atoms are at opposite sides of the newly
formed C–C covalent bond. With different molecular shapes,
various product configurations can be derived from the two positioning
types. Figure 1b gives
two examples of precursor molecules with a bent and a straight shape,
respectively. For the 1,3-BPyB molecule with 120° backbone, each
type of the positioning mode leads to three different kinds of product
configurations (A, B, C for type-I and E, F, G for type-II), regardless
of the mirror symmetrical ones here. For the straight 1,4-BPyB molecule,
there is only one kind of product for each mode (D for type-I and
H for type-II).

Figure 1 Scheme of selective C–H bond activation controlled
by metal–organic
coordination interaction. (a) C–H bond activation and dehydrogenative
homocoupling occurring on the ortho-sites of a pyridine
group. Two different types of products can be obtained considering
planar restriction. (b) Two types of product configuration generalized
from 1,3-BPyB and 1,4-BPyB. Products of type-I configurations can
be selectively synthesized by the coordination-restricted effect.

Thus, the classification shown in Figure 1 provides an idea to selectively control
the product configuration by elaborate predesign of the molecular
shape and the bonding type between reactant molecules. By utilizing
the robust coordination interaction throughout the whole reaction
process, products of type-I configurations can be tendentiously synthesized;
by selecting precursor molecules of highly symmetrical backbones,
the kinds of possible products can be further reduced.

On the
basis of above strategy, we investigated the selective C–H
bond activation reactions of 1,3-BPyB and 1,4-BPyB on Cu(111) by scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM). When deposited at room temperature (RT),
the V-shaped 1,3-BPyB molecules interact with Cu adatoms via two-fold
coordination interaction41−45 and form discrete closed rings on Cu(111) as reported previously.46 When the sample is heated to a slightly higher
temperature (320 K), a few distorted connected rings are observed
as indicated by the cyan circles in Figure 2a. Intact coordinated rings still dominate
the whole surface at this temperature. After further annealing the
sample at a temperature of 350 K, coordinated rings almost fully disappear
and branched, irregular structures emerge, as shown in Figure 2b.

The length of scale bar in panels c–f equals to 2 nm. All STM
images are acquired under constant-height mode and (a, b) Vb = 10 mV, It = 51 pA; (c–f) Vb = 5 mV, It = 60 pA.

Figure 2c
depicts
the fine structures of the partly reacted rings marked by the cyan
circle in Figure 2a.
The shape of these distorted rings gives a hint to a reaction process
in which the dehydrogenative homocoupling occurs under the restriction
of aboriginal coordination bonds. The formation of coupling products
can be affirmed by their smooth appearance. Besides, it is nearly
impossible for two pristine 1,3-BPyB molecules to stay so close to
each other due to the repulsive interaction between peripheral hydrogen
atoms. The coupled 1,3-BPyB molecules look brighter than those pristine
ones. Figure 2d shows
an example of a highly disordered structure containing three kinds
of products (A, B, and C) concurrently. Apart from aforementioned
products that emerge after thermal activation, there are some interesting
ribbon-like patterns as shown in Figures 2e and f. The chain in Figure 2e is formed entirely by the saddle-like products
A as portrayed by the white contours. Each product A connects to its
lateral neighbors via N–Cu–N coordination. Figure 2f shows a kind of
compound structure constructed by regularly arranged product A and
C. The contours of product C have been highlighted and discriminated
by different colors according to adsorption-induced chirality on surface.

Notably, the dehydrogenative coupling products of 1,3-BPyB on Cu(111)
exclusively possess type-I configuration, corroborating the important
role of coordination interaction throughout the C–H bond activation
and dehydrogenative coupling process. Because of the restriction effect
of the robust coordination bond, the two N atoms are always kept on
the same side and coordinating to the same Cu adatom in type-I configuration. Figure 2g concretes the dominating
impact of coordination interaction on final product configuration.

Although the products are restricted to coordination-inclined configurations,
there are still various product structures due to the bent molecular
shape of 1,3-BPyB. It remains difficult to separate different kinds
of coexisted products. Besides, it is impractical to increase the
reaction temperature or extend the duration of heating owing to the
significant desorption rate of molecules. To pursue the ultimate goal
of a single-product system, it is necessary to reduce the kinds of
products from the origin. For this purpose, 1,4-BPyB with straight
and symmetrical molecular skeleton is employed. Without thermal activation,
1,4-BPyB molecules assemble into one-dimensional coordinated chains
on Cu(111) through robust two-fold N–Cu–N coordination,
as displayed in Figure 3a. After the sample was heated to 350 K, the C–H bond activation
and covalent coupling were triggered, and as expected, only product
D was obtained because of the restriction effect of the coordination
bond. The distorted honeycomb-like network in Figure 3b is made up of pristine 1,4-BPyB and product
D with prevailed three-fold coordination. One unreacted 1,4-BPyB molecule
is stabilized by two products D in the form of three-fold coordination.
Products D interplay with each other by secondary dehydrogenative
coupling, forming a snake-like polymer. Structures fully composed
of such covalent polymers are occasionally observed as shown in Figure 3c; however, on a
much smaller scale compared to the combined network in Figure 3b due to the intrinsic irreversibility
and low diffusion ability of covalent bond.

conductance (dI/dV) spectra measured

The background spectrum (black) is measured on bare Cu(111) area.
The forked arrows in panels a–d indicate equivalent [11̅0]
direction. All the STM images were acquired under constant-height
mode and (a) Vb = 1 mV, It = 75 pA; (b) Vb = 1 mV, It = 90 pA; (c) Vb = 5 mV, It =
80 pA; (d) Vb = 0.01
mV, It = 156 pA.

To corroborate the involvement
of coordinated Cu adatoms, a molecule-functionalized
STM tip was utilized for imaging. The appearance of the coordinated
Cu adatoms can be clearly identified by the bright protrusions in Figure 3d, indicated with
white arrows. There is one coordinated Cu adatom connecting a pristine
1,4-BPyB and a product D in a three-fold coordination node, and two
adjacent Cu adatoms bridging two opposite products D of neighboring
polymers. Structural models of a coordination trimer and two opposite
products D with two interstitial Cu adatoms are presented in Figures 3e and f, respectively. Figure 3g illustrates the
reaction process of 1,4-BPyB from coordinated dimer to single-product
D, then to the final covalent polymer, which can act as the building
block for ordered covalent network like those shown in Figure 3b and c. Scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal molecular unoccupied states
for pristine and reacted 1,4-BPyB, respectively. As shown in Figure 3h, the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) for a pristine 1,4-BPyB is measured to be
about 1.7 eV (red curve), while after dehydrogenative coupling the
LUMO shifts to ∼1.9 eV (green and blue curves).

Series
of dI/dV maps were also
recorded under varied sample voltages to investigate the electronic
features of dehydrogenative coupling structures. As depicted in Figure 4, the topographs
(labeled by Topo.) and the dI/dV maps (labeled by dI/dV) acquired
on a part of the coupling honeycomb network are featureless at negative
sample voltages. As the voltage becomes more positive, the coordinated
nodes of the polymer (indicated by blue circles) appear much brighter
than the rest. By contrast, the pristine 1,4-BPyB molecule has much
dimmer contour in both STM images and dI/dV maps at 1 and 2 V. Identical tendency is observed in simulated
topographs and dI/dV maps of a polymer
fragment using bSKAN-VASP code.47,48 This corroborates the
models we put forward with in Figure 3g. To be noted, more details can be observed in our
simulated topographic and dI/dV maps
than in the experimental images. This is because that the tip is approximated
as an atom and only s orbital is considered. For a real tip, it usually
has complicated shape and its electric configuration may contain s,
d, p orbitals, which would lead to reduced resolution in the experimental
images.

Figure 4 Experimental and calculated topographs and dI/dV maps of coupling structures formed by 1,4-BPyB on Cu(111).
The calculated results (labeled by Cal.) agree well with experimental
observations (labeled by Exp.) that the coordinated nodes of a marked
polymer appear much brighter than the rest part at large positive
voltages. All the experimental and calculated topographs and dI/dV maps are acquired under constant-height
mode.

The formation of a covalent bond
between ortho-site carbons of neighboring molecules
after C–H bond activation
was verified by performing noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM)
measurements, as shown in Figure 5. CO molecules were codeposited onto the Cu(111) surface
to form a CO-modified tip, as shown in Figure 5a. After picking up a single CO molecule
onto the tip apex,49,50 the newly formed C–C bonds
were unambiguously observed from the nc-AFM frequency shift image
(Figures 5b and S3). The sharp homogeneous line in the nc-AFM
image that connects two pyridine groups (see white arrow Figure 5d) clearly indicates
a additional C–C bond between neighboring molecules, while
the Cu adatom in the coordination bond does not show a pronounced
contrast (see green and yellow arrow in Figure 5d). The distortions observed at the central
carbon rings of the molecule are caused by frustrated rotations of
the corresponding ring.51 Mechanical manipulation
was also employed to confirm the formation of a covalent C–C
bond as demonstrated in Figure S1. An initially
fixed product D in a two-fold coordinated chain could be peeled off
intactly by a STM tip and moved individually, indicating the formation
of robust covalent bond within product D.

14 pA; (b, d) The tip is 10 pm retracted relative to a STM set point

The surface-assisted C–H bond activation on the ortho-site of a pyridyl molecule was confirmed by density
functional theory (DFT) calculations with climbing image nudged-elastic
band (CI-NEB) method. As shown in Figure 6, a single pyridine ring with one fixed (marked
by a blue circle) and one free Cu adatom (marked by a yellow circle)
is set as the initial state (IS). During the C–H bond activation
process, the fixed Cu adatom always keeps coordinating to the N atom,
while the free Cu adatom gradually approaches the ortho-H atom and finally cuts it off from the ortho-site
(final state, FS). The variation of the molecular configuration and
the path of the additional free Cu adatom can be clearly identified
in Figure 6a. The reaction
barrier between neighboring immediate states is illustrated in Figure 6b. The IS transforms
into the first transition state 1 experiencing an energy barrier of
0.14 eV. The second transition state (state 3) is reached by overcoming
a barrier of 1.28 eV from the immediate state 2. Then the FS is achieved
by an energy relaxation of 1.16 eV from the transition state 3. Once
the barrier of C–H dissociation is overcome, the Cu–C
bond dissociation would occur with a much lower energy barrier of
0.76 eV (Figure S5) and a subsequent spontaneous
C–C coupling follows.

bond activation process of a single pyridine ring on Cu(111). (a)
Top and side view of molecular configuration and adatom position throughout
the C–H bond activation process. The pyridine ring keeps coordinating
to one Cu adatom, while the other free Cu adatom migrates to remove
the ortho-H atom. (b) Calculated reaction barrier
between different immediate sates in the dehydrogenation process.

To study the role of a coordinated
Cu adatom extensively, the reaction
path with only a free Cu adatom and no coordinated adatom was calculated
as a comparison, as given in Figure S2.
In this case, the barrier for dehydrogenation is about 1.27 eV, nearly
the same as when the coordinated Cu adatom is present. It points out
the fact that the coordinated Cu adatom has little influence on changing
the dehydrogenation barrier, and only the free Cu adatom plays the
role of catalyst. The exclusive effect of a coordinated Cu adatom
is to anchor the steric configuration of precursor molecules. When
considering the stray hydrogen atoms,52−54 the calculated barrier
reduces to 0.65 eV (Figure S7). The calculation
well explains why the C–H activation can happen at the rather
low temperature.

Utilizing the spatial restriction effect of
coordination bonds
and precursors of highly symmetrical structures, the kinds of product
configurations have been greatly reduced in the 1,4-BPyB/Cu(111) system.
However, inhomogeneities of the final product structure still exist
as the length of polymer is random and hard to control. Therefore,
it is not strictly a system of single-product. Besides, the stiffness
of the long covalent backbone of the polymer may hinder the formation
of large-sized ordered network.

To improve the overall orderliness
of the final product structure,
based on the above considerations, the secondary C–H bond activation
on the ends of product D should be suppressed and the occurrence of
polymers should be reduced. Therefore, the strong catalytic Cu(111)
surface was replaced with the relatively inert Au(111) surface, and
more robust three-fold N–Fe coordination was employed to counteract
the severe molecular desorption. Following the route designed above,
1,4-BPyB and Fe atoms were codeposited onto Au(111) and preheated
to 320 K to realize sufficient coordination before C–H bond
activation. A large-scale honeycomb network was constructed with Fe–N
coordination interaction55−57 and a coordinated trimer as the
basic unit is presented in Figures 7a and b. The molecular model of a coordinated trimer
is demonstrated in Figure 7c. After the coordinated network is annealed at 350 K, a distinct
phase appears, as shown in Figure 7d. From the close-up of Figure 7e, it is identified that such a network with
octagonal cavities consists of regularly mixed pristine 1,4-BPyB and
products D. In contrast to the coupling network in Figure 3b on Cu(111), the products
D here are completely intact individuals and no undesired polymer
is found. Pristine 1,4-BPyB and product D are all stabilized by three-fold
N–Fe coordination. Figure 7g and h display the reaction path calculated by CI-NEB
method, in which the pyridyl ring on Au(111) surface keeps coordinating
to a Fe atom (marked by a blue circle) with a free Au adatom (marked
by yellow circle) aside. The calculated dehydrogenation barrier is
about 0.88 eV. Different from the case of Cu(111), the dehydrogenation
process does not require help from the additional Au adatom and could
occur with only a coordinated Fe atom. The calculated barrier increases
to 1.59 eV without the Fe atom (Figure S6).

mode, Vb = 0.5 V, It = 30 pA; (b) constant-height
mode, Vb = 50 mV, It = 60 pA; (e) constant-height
mode, Vb = 10 mV, It = 70 pA.

From the DFT calculations in Figures 6a and 7g, it could
be recognized clearly that the targeted pyridyl C–H bond is
pulled down toward the metal adatom, leading to a reduced C–H
dissociation barrier. Similar “pulling effect” has been
reported in other C–H activation-related studies. For example,
in the ortho-site coupling of phenol derivatives,
the phenol group has to tilt away from the surface first to allow
the approaching of a metal adatom to ortho-site C–H
bond and then be pulled down toward surface due to the interaction
of the ortho-site carbon radical with the metal adatom.37 For the case where metal adatom is absent, the
targeted C–H bond is pulled down directly toward surface through
interactions of adjacent radical sites with surface atoms.58 Therefore, the approximation of molecules toward
catalyzing metal adatoms or surface atoms is critical to facilitate
aromatic C–H bond activation, despite the dependence of particular
approach on the initial precursor state and actual reaction environment.

The evolution of product configuration in the absence of spatial
restriction from coordination bond was studied as a contrast. The
selectivity induced by aforehand hydrogen-bonded self-assembly structures
has been observed in Ullmann Coupling process.38 The two molecules studied both self-assemble into close-packed
islands on Au(100) surface at RT. The basic unit is windmill-like
hydrogen-bonded tetramer, as shown in Figures 8a and f. The sizes of unit cells marked by
white dashed squares are measured to be 2.2 and 2.1 nm, respectively.
Identical hydrogen-bonded tetramer islands formed by 1,3-BPyB and
by 1,4-BPyB can be acquired on Au(111) as well. However, almost all
molecules desorb before the desired C–H bond activation could
occur. By contrast, a few coupling products are able to survive on
Au(100) owing to stronger molecule–substrate interaction than
that on Au(111). Representative results after annealing the sample
at 350 K are shown in Figure 8b and c, and g and h. As expected, products of type-II configuration
emerge for both 1,3-BPyB (Figure 8b,c) and 1,4-BPyB (Figure 8g,h) for the lack of sufficient spatial restricting
force like that offered by a coordination bond.

K. Most of the 1,4-BPyB molecules are unreacted and stabilized by
two-fold coordination with Au adatoms, fabricating one-dimensional
coordinated chains. A few coupling products H are found interspersed
in the coordinated chains as circled. (h) Close-up of products H with
opposite chirality. (i) Molecular model of product H. The white arrows
point to the [011] direction and stand for 2 nm. Scanning parameters:

mV, It = 80 pA; (f) Vb = 100 mV, It = 70 pA; (g) Vb = 10 mV, It = 90 pA; (h) Vb = 3 mV, It =
120 pA.

Moreover, these products with
type-II configuration are found to
show size matching with substrate lattice. Figure 8d, e, and i depict the corresponding
molecular models of product E, F and H, respectively. The size of
product E fits the distance between neighboring reconstructed ridges
of Au(100); the backbone of product F and H is aligned along the reconstructed
direction of Au(100). Except for the coupling products, great amounts
of pristine 1,3- and 1,4-BPyB are stabilized by two-fold N–Au
coordination due to the significant increase of Au adatoms after thermal
activation. Most of the one-dimensional coordinated chains align along
the [011] reconstructed direction of Au(100) surface. Notably, no
product G is found for 1,3-BPyB on Au surface. The highly asymmetrical
structure and the mismatch of size and orientation toward the surface
are assumed to be responsible. Further annealing causes complete molecular
desorption in our experiment. To highlight the effectivity of coordination
bond in terms of controlling product configuration, we compared the
yields of type-I and II products in both coordination and noncoordination
systems as shown in Figure S4. In a coordination
system, type-I products are overwhelming, while in a deficient coordination
system, the two types of products coexist and no selectivity is found.

Conclusions
In summary, we studied the influence of coordination interaction
and self-assembly on final product configuration in ortho-site C–H bond activation and dehydrogenative homocoupling
of pyridyl molecules on metal surfaces. Assisted STS measurements,
mechanical manipulation, nc-AFM, and DFT calculations were performed
to verify the formation of the coupling product. Because of the spatial
restriction effect of robust N–Cu–N coordination bonds
during the whole reaction process on Cu(111), only those configurations
that allow a coordinated Cu adatom to stay between two pyridine groups
can be formed. The varieties of product configuration could be further
reduced by using precursor molecules of highly symmetrical shape.
Moreover, by choosing coordination interaction of appropriate coordination
number and inert metal surface, a large-scale ordered compound network
containing only one kind of coupling product was constructed utilizing
1,4-BPyB of straight backbone and three-fold Fe–N coordination
on Au(111). Our findings unveil the vital influence of coordination
interaction on product configurations in terms of selective C–H
bond activation, which is promising for controllable on-surface synthesis.

Methods
STM Experiments
Sample preparation and measurements
were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum LT-STM system (Unisoku) equipped
with standard surface preparation facilities. The Cu(111), Au(111),
and Au(100) substrates were prepared by cycles of Ar+ sputtering
and annealing. The commercial 1,3-BPyB and 1,4-BPyB molecules were
deposited onto the metal substrates from homemade tantalum crucibles.
Fe atoms were sublimated from Knudsen crucible at about 1500 K. The
substrates were kept at room temperature during deposition of molecules
and Fe atoms. The duration of reaction was 10 min unless stated otherwise.
The vacuum was maintained in the order of 10–10 Torr
during molecular deposition and subsequent imaging. All STM images
were acquired at 4 K using a sharpened Pt/Ir tip.

AFM Experiments
The nc-AFM measurement was carried
out with a low-temperature STM/AFM (Scienta-Omicron GmbH) in combination
with the Nanonis control electronics (SPECS GmbH). The instrument
was housed in a two-chamber ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system equipped
with a separate preparation chamber (base pressure below 10–10 mbar). All AFM images were acquired in constant-height mode at 4.3
K. Commercial qPlus tuning fork sensors (Scienta-Omicron GmbH) with
a chemically etched tungsten tip were used (resonance frequency f0 ≈ 21.255 kHz, Q ≈
10 000, and Aosc = 80 pm). To achieve submolecular resolution, the tip apex was functionalized
with a single CO molecule. The tuning fork was grounded, and the applied
bias voltages refer to the sample. For AFM imaging, a small offset
gap voltage (<1 mV) was used to minimize the tunneling current.

DFT Calculations
DFT calculations were performed with
climbing image nudged-elastic band (CI-NEB) method by using the 5.3.5
version of the Vienna Ab initio Simulations Package
(VASP).59−61 The core electrons were described by the pseudopotentials
constructed according to the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.62 The exchange–correlation energy was calculated
with the opt-B88 functional63−65 to take into account the van
der Waals (vdW) dispersive correction. The Cu(111) and Au(111) surface
was modeled by a slab of 64 atoms composed by four atomic layers.
The supercell containing molecule-slab has a dimension of 10.27 Å
× 8.89 Å × 22.01 Å and 11.77 Å × 11.77
Å × 22.01 Å, respectively. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
grid was used for the Brillouin zone sampling. Simulations of STM
images and dI/dV maps were performed
on a periodic polymer fragment using bSKAN code47,48 based on VASP. A supercell containing an intact product D and two
coordinated Cu adatoms was built to construct the periodic polymer
according to experimental results.
