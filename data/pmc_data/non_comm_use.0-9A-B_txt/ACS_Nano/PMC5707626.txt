Strong
electric fields are known to influence the properties of
molecules as well as materials. Here we show that by changing the
orientation of an externally applied electric field, one can locally
control the mixing behavior of two molecules physisorbed on a solid
surface. Whether the starting two-component network evolves into an
ordered two-dimensional (2D) cocrystal, yields an amorphous network
where the two components phase separate, or shows preferential adsorption
of only one component depends on the solution stoichiometry. The experiments
are carried out by changing the orientation of the strong electric
field that exists between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope
and a solid substrate. The structure of the two-component network
typically changes from open porous at negative substrate bias to relatively
compact when the polarity of the applied bias is reversed. The electric-field-induced
mixing behavior is reversible, and the supramolecular system exhibits
excellent stability and good response efficiency. When molecular guests
are adsorbed in the porous networks, the field-induced switching behavior
was found to be completely different. Plausible reasons behind the
field-induced mixing behavior are discussed.

Electrostatic
forces define
most chemical and biological processes. Chemical reactions involve
rearrangement of charges and electric fields associated with those
charges. The stabilization of charged intermediates under given experimental
conditions often determines the reactivity of chemical processes.
In fact, reaction rates of a number of electrochemical processes are
controlled by an applied electrical potential gradient. Natural systems
also use electrostatic forces in a number of different ways. The high
catalytic efficiency of enzymes is ascribed to their ability to stabilize
charged transition states by using precisely positioned, preorganized
polar functional groups within the active site. The efficiency of
enzyme catalysis is intimately correlated with the magnitude of the
electrostatic field exerted by its active site. The influence of local
electric fields on the stabilization or destabilization of reaction
intermediates is also invoked for explaining chemical catalysis.1,2

Although intensively harnessed by natural systems, the use
of external
electric fields (EEFs) to control chemical processes is one of the
most underdeveloped strategies in synthetic chemistry. The idea that
EEFs could be used to influence the outcome of chemical reactions
is exciting because if one could use EEFs instead of ionic species
as catalysts, it would be possible to manipulate a broad range of
reactions. While the ability to control reaction rates using EEFs
is often associated with redox systems, recent theoretical studies
suggest that, if oriented precisely with respect to the reaction center,
EEFs can potentially alter the course of chemical reactions even for
nonredox processes.3 This is because many
covalent species have minor charge-separated contributors and EEFs
awaken these dormant ionic structures.4 EEFs are thus capable of manipulating the kinetics and/or thermodynamics
of chemical reactions. It has been argued recently that oriented EEFs
have the potential to be used as smart reagents for chemical reactions.1

For EEFs to be effective, the orientation
of the field with respect
to the chemical bonds is crucial.4 This
poses a major challenge for the evolution of the concept since orienting
the field in precise directions and/or fixing the molecules in specific
orientations is not straightforward. A scanning tunneling microscope
(STM), where an extremely strong electric field exists between a sharp
metallic tip and a flat conductive surface, provides a seamless experimental
setup to study the influence of EEFs on (supra)molecular systems.
Due to the atomically sharp nature of the STM tip and a few-angstrom-wide
gap between the tip and the substrate, a highly localized and directional
electric field can be applied to systems positioned in this tunnel
junction. Given the vanishingly small gap between the two electrodes,
an electric field strength as high as ∼109 V/m is
considered normal under typical experimental conditions.5

In a recent example, an STM setup was used
to study EEF-induced
catalysis of Diels–Alder reaction.6 The issue of specific orientation of the reagents with respect to
the EEF was resolved by attaching the diene to the STM tip and by
forming a chemisorbed self-assembled monolayer of the dienophile on
a gold surface. Application of a voltage difference between the tip
and the gold surface and moving the tip closer to the surface generated
a tunneling current, which indicated the formation of the product
in the tunnel junction. The frequency of product formation was studied
using the break-junction (B-J) technique,7 which provided a statistically relevant reaction rate. A 5-fold
increase in the frequency of Diels–Alder adduct formation was
observed in the presence of the oriented electric field, which ensures
electron flow from the dienophile to the diene. This study demonstrated
that carbon–carbon bond formation is accelerated in the presence
of an oriented EEF.6

EEFs exhibit
a range of different effects on molecular systems.
The most commonly known effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral
lines of atoms and molecules in the presence of EEFs, known as the
Stark effect.8 Electric-field-induced orientation
of liquid-crystalline materials is a widely studied phenomenon that
has already found a number of applications in day-to-day life.9 It has been predicted that if an in-plane homogeneous
electric field is applied across zigzag edges of graphene nanoribbons,
the electrical current can be completely spin polarized.10 Reversible trans–cis isomerization of single azobenzene derivatives was achieved using
the electric field applied between an STM tip and a Au(111) surface.11 The electric field in an STM setup was also
used to induce reversible transitions in physisorbed monolayers12−15 and for triggering formation of physisorbed bilayers.16,17 Precisely defined movement of single molecular motors across an
unmodified Cu surface was achieved using voltage pulses applied to
the STM tip.18 Recently, the tip of an
STM has been employed to carry out a deacetylation reaction in a spatially
controlled manner without significantly affecting the rest of the
self-assembled monolayer, thereby allowing writing and reading of
information at the nanoscale using molecular ink.19

In this contribution, we demonstrate yet another
application of
oriented EEFs. We show that by reversing the direction of the strong
electric field that exists between the STM tip and a conductive solid
substrate, one can locally control the mixing behavior of two molecules
physisorbed on the surface. The experiment is carried out at the interface
of an organic solution and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).
When a solution containing a mixture of the two molecules in appropriate
stoichiometry is deposited on HOPG, a crystalline, bicomponent supramolecular
network with open voids is obtained. Starting with such a porous crystalline
network at negative substrate bias, the constitution and topology
of the supramolecular surface can be interchanged in a reversible
fashion by simply flipping the substrate polarity. Whether the two
molecules mix to yield an ordered crystalline network, or phase separate
into an amorphous network, or show preferential adsorption of only
one component at opposite substrate polarity is determined by the
starting surface composition of the network, which in turn is dictated
by the stoichiometry of the two molecules in solution. The outcome
of the field-induced switching can be altered by incorporating guest
molecules in the porous bicomponent network formed initially, in which
case no switching is observed (Figure 1). We also discuss plausible mechanistic aspects of
this EEF-induced switching behavior. The present investigation enriches
the realm of EEF-induced chemical processes, which could potentially
alter the way making and breaking of bonds is considered.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the molecular structures of the building blocks used in this study.
Both 1,3,5-tri(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (BTB) and trimesic acid
(TMA) are archetypal building blocks that assemble via R22(8) hydrogen bonding between carboxylic
groups, and both yield a honeycomb porous network under typical experimental
conditions when adsorbed independently.20−23 Furthermore, when mixed in appropriate
stoichiometry in solution, the two molecules form mixed self-assembled
networks. Three different crystalline, open porous monolayer phases
are obtained at the heptanoic acid (HA)/HOPG interface.24 All three cocrystalline phases are stabilized
via R22(8) hydrogen bonding between carboxylic
groups of BTB and TMA. We used these perfectly crystalline arrangements
as a model system to study the mixing behavior of molecules under
varying electric field polarity. In the following paragraphs, we describe
how the fate of the three crystalline arrangements changes when the
substrate bias is reversed from negative to positive.

2D Cocrystal
→ 2D Cocrystal
Using relatively
dilute solutions of the two components in HA, a perfectly crystalline
mixed monolayer of BTB–TMA is obtained at negative substrate
bias. Figure 2a shows
a high-resolution STM image of the mixed monolayer formed at the HA/HOPG
interface at negative sample bias, hereafter called 2D cocrystal A. Figure 2c displays a molecular
model for cocrystal A built using the lattice parameters obtained
from calibrated STM images. The network consists of hydrogen bonded
homomeric dimers of BTB and TMA further connected to each other via heteromeric R22(8) hydrogen bonding.
This ring synthon Rxy(Z) describes the characteristic association
mode of aromatic carboxylic acids, where x and y are the number of H-bond donor and acceptor centers and Z is the total number of atoms in the ring. The unit cell
is rectangular and contains two molecules of BTB and TMA each. Changing
the orientation of the electric field by reversing the polarity of
the applied sample bias leads to a structural transition. A relatively
compact, crystalline two-component network is formed at positive substrate
bias (Figure 2b). The
unit cell of this phase, hereafter called 2D cocrystal B, is oblique
and also contains two molecules of BTB and TMA each. Figure 2d shows the corresponding molecular
model. In contrast to the model for cocrystal A, where the relative
arrangement of the two molecules can be easily understood based on
R22(8) hydrogen bonding, the relative positions
of BTB and TMA in cocrystal B do not clearly reveal how the molecules
interact with each other. In the model proposed in Figure 2d, the positions of the two
molecules are accurately reproduced; however their relative orientation
is somewhat tentative. At first glance the ordered compact network
obtained at positive substrate bias appears to be sustained by a combination
of heteromeric R22(8) hydrogen bonding between
BTB and TMA (vide infra) and relatively weak aromatic
−C–H---O= interactions between the BTB–BTB
and BTB–TMA molecules. Based on the molecular arrangement,
it appears that there is partial disruption of the original R22(8) hydrogen bonding at positive substrate bias.

The time-dependence
of all structural transitions discussed here
was evaluated by considering the outcome of the switching immediately
after reversing the bias and also after 10 min of scanning the surface
continuously at a given (reversed) polarity. Based on this consideration,
this 2D cocrystal to 2D cocrystal structural transition is relatively
sluggish because only a few isolated small domains of 2D cocrystal
B were observed immediately after reversing the polarity. The system
evolves into a long-range-ordered network only after further continuous
scanning of the same area at positive substrate bias for ∼10
min. Electric-field-induced structural transitions for the parent
BTB network (alone), however, were found to be almost instantaneous,
wherein the network changes from one scan line to the other upon reversing
the polarity.13,14 Despite its sluggishness in the
forward direction, the transition in the BTB–TMA network described
above is fully reversible and can be initiated by reversing the substrate
bias back to negative. Although the opposite transformation is almost
instantaneous, sometimes the network obtained immediately after the
polarity switch is that of cocrystal C, which transitions into the
cocrystal A in the subsequent scan. Large, well-ordered domains of
2D cocrystal A are obtained with virtually no defects after continuously
scanning the area for 10 min (for time-dependence of the transitions
see Figure S2 and Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information).

2D Cocrystal → BTB (Preferential Adsorption)
An increase in the concentration of the two components in solution
yields a bicomponent supramolecular network with hexagonal symmetry
at negative substrate bias, hereafter called 2D cocrystal C. Figure 3a shows an STM image
of the network, which consists of alternating hexagons made up of
only BTB molecules and four molecules of BTB and two molecules of
TMA, respectively. The unit cell is relatively large and contains
two molecules of TMA and six molecules of BTB. Figure 3c provides a molecular model corresponding
to the STM image. It reveals that, similar to cocrystal A, this network
is also sustained by homomeric and heteromeric R22(8) hydrogen bonding between BTB and BTB–TMA molecules, respectively.
Reversal of the substrate bias led to appearance of another phase,
which is entirely composed of BTB molecules (Figure 3b). The unit cell of this phase is oblique
and consists of two BTB molecules. The molecular model provided in Figure 3d reveals that dimeric
rows of BTB molecules are stabilized by a combination of regular R22(8) hydrogen bonding (vide infra), lateral hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxyl groups
of adjacent BTB molecules within the same dimer row, and possibly
also weak aromatic −C–H---O=C– hydrogen
bonding between molecules that belong to adjacent rows. This is clearly
a case of preferential adsorption of BTB over TMA at positive values
of substrate bias. The polarity switch expels the TMA molecules from
the HOPG surface. The reverse transition, however, reaccommodates
the TMA molecules back into the network, thereby furnishing back the
original 2D cocrystal C. Notably, the forward as well as the reverse
transitions in this case are virtually instantaneous with changes
in the network observed within a few scan lines after the reversal
in bias polarity (see Figure S5 in the
Supporting Information). Thus, in contrast to the previous case, the
outcome of this switching experiment is almost the same immediately
after the reversal of the substrate polarity and after continuous
scanning of the same area for 10 min.

respectively. Panels (c) and (d) show molecular models corresponding

C see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information.

2D Cocrystal → Amorphous
Network
Further increase
in the concentration of the two components in HA solution yielded
another bicomponent network with hexagonal symmetry. 2D cocrystal
D is formed at negative substrate bias and consists of alternating
hexagons made up of only TMA molecules and four TMA and two BTB molecules,
respectively (Figure 4a). The unit cell contains six molecules of TMA and two molecules
of BTB. Thus, this network features the exact opposite arrangement
of BTB and TMA molecules within the lattice in comparison to that
in cocrystal C. Similar to the two previous cocrystal networks observed
at negative polarities, this network is also stabilized by homomeric
and heteromeric R22(8) hydrogen bonds between
the two molecules (Figure 4c). Reversing the substrate bias lead to formation of an amorphous
network as shown in Figure 4b. This network features randomly distributed BTB as well
as TMA molecules. No structural order evolved even after scanning
the surface for 10 min. In fact, the amorphous structure persists
even after scanning the same area for much longer times (∼2
h). Similar to other monolayer phases described above, the opposite
transition occurs readily, furnishing ordered domains of cocrystal
D (for time-dependence, see Figure S7 in
the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Reversible transition between 2D cocrystal D
and an amorphous network
comprising both BTB and TMA achieved by reversing the polarity of
the substrate bias (CBTB = 2.5 ×
10–4 M and CTMA = 1.7
× 10–3 M). Panels (a) and (b) show STM images
of the 2D cocrystal D and the amorphous network formed at negative
and positive substrate polarity, respectively. Panel (c) shows a molecular
model corresponding to the STM image provided in (a). Imaging parameters:
(a) Iset = 90 pA, Vbias = −1.0 V; (b) Iset =
90 pA, Vbias = 1.0 V. Unit cell parameters
are provided in Table 1. For a large-scale STM image of cocrystal D see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information.

The experimental results described above clearly reveal that
open,
crystalline bicomponent phases are stabilized at negative substrate
bias, whereas relatively compact networks survive at positive substrate
bias. The precise outcome of the EEF-induced switching, i.e., whether the system forms another 2D cocrystal,
shows preferential adsorption of one component, or leads to formation
of an amorphous monolayer phase, depends on the starting surface composition.
It can be readily noticed that all the networks formed at negative
substrate bias are stabilized by head-to-head R22(8) hydrogen bonding, whereas the ones obtained by reversing the
substrate bias show partial or complete disruption of the R22(8) hydrogen bonds. BTB and TMA molecules appear to adsorb
in a planar conformation in the monolayer phases observed at positive
as well as negative substrate bias. This brings us to an important
question: What is the influence of the polarity switch at the level
of single molecule? In the following paragraphs we attempt to divulge
the different possibilities.

Mechanistic Aspects
Monolayer phases
of the parent
BTB system can be reversibly switched between different states by
using two types of external stimuli: thermal25,26 and EEF.13,14 Thermally induced structural
transitions in the BTB network have been studied both under UHV conditions25 and at the solution–solid interface.26 The porous honeycomb network of BTB formed under
UHV conditions on a Ag(111) surface undergoes two structural transitions
wherein the initial open porous network transforms into successively
more compact structures. The onset of a Shockley surface state monitored
from dI/dV spectroscopy for each
network indicated the presence of gradually increasing negative charge
on the surface consistent with deprotonated carboxyl groups. Thus,
thermally induced deprotonation of the carboxylic groups was proposed
to be the driving force behind the structural transitions in the BTB
network.25 It must be noted that the first
transition occurs at only 320 K, indicating a relatively facile deprotonation
process. Similar temperature-induced deprotonation behavior has been
reported for TMA adsorbed on a Ag(111) surface.27

A second hypothesis was proposed on the basis of
EEF-induced switching observed in a BTB network at the nonanoic acid/HOPG
interface.13 It was hypothesized that the
alignment of the molecular dipole with respect to the electric field
upon reversing the direction of applied bias is responsible for the
observed structural transitions. It must be noted that optimization
of the BTB molecular structure in this work13 was carried out under vacuum, which allows free rotation of the
carboxyphenyl rings. The molecule, however, adsorbs in a planar conformation
on the graphite surface, and the planar conformation does not have
any net dipole moment. The authors claimed that this mechanism is
also compatible with the formation of partially deprotonated BTB species
at positive values of substrate bias that can be assisted by water
traces. The typical organic solvents used for STM experiments are
often stored under ambient conditions and thus may contain several
parts per million of water. The water molecules can act as proton
acceptors and thus drive the transition to the compact structure at
positive values of substrate bias. This combined information indicates
that the electric field alignment of the molecular dipole may not
be sufficient to explain the EEF-induced structural transitions in
BTB monolayers, and the partial deprotonation of BTB at positive substrate
bias cannot be ruled out.

In order to evaluate which mechanism
is consonant with the present
system, we attempted to assess the fate of TMA upon reversal in the
substrate bias. Since TMA is a small rigid molecule, it is not expected
to exhibit any dipole moment arising due to free rotation of phenyl
rings as observed for BTB. Besides, it is well-known that the carboxyl
groups of TMA (as well as BTB) form in-plane hydrogen bonds upon adsorption
on the surface of HOPG, meaning that the hydrogen bonds and thus the
carboxyl group itself are coplanar with the rest of the aromatic framework.
Experimental results clearly reveal that the honeycomb network of
TMA obtained at negative substrate bias changes into a densely packed
network that consists of rows of TMA molecules when the substrate
bias is reversed (Supporting Information Figure S8). This network can be switched back to the original honeycomb
structure by reversing the polarity of the substrate bias. We note
that the structural transitions in the TMA network are sporadic, meaning
that there are instances when the network does not change immediately
upon changing the polarity of the substrate bias. While the exact
origin of this irregular switching process is not clear, it could
be related to the relatively smaller difference in the packing densities
of the two networks obtained at opposite substrate polarities.

Although the discussion provided above alludes to partial deprotonation
of the carboxylic acid groups as the reason underlying the observed
transitions, we agree that the arguments provided are fairly circumstantial.
It has been contended in the past that prediction of supramolecular
networks cannot exclusively be based on formation of ideal intermolecular
hydrogen bonds because certain aromatic carboxylic acids are known
to disfavor regular R22(8) hydrogen bonding
due to packing constraints.28,29 Notwithstanding these
aspects, theoretical studies provide ample indication that covalent
bond cleavage is possible under high electric fields (∼109 V/m) that exist at the tip–sample junction in an STM
setup.1,4 Many formally covalent bonds possess minor
charge-separated resonance contributors. It has been suggested that
an electric field is capable of electrostatically stabilizing such
ionic forms and thus may result in overall stabilization of an alternative
(supra)molecular structure.30 In such a
scenario, the presence of high EEF ensures that the ionic structure
energetically crosses over below the covalent structure, thus eventually
leading to bond cleavage.31 It must be
noted that a number of these calculations were carried out on homonuclear
diatomic molecules such as H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, etc. Compared to
these, the current system involves a relatively polar −O–H
bond with a readily dissociable proton. Thus, it is not unreasonable
to assume partial deprotonation of the molecules at positive substrate
bias. The behavior of the C–Cl bond, which is a relatively
polar bond, under EEFs is particularly interesting in this context
and is in line with the present experimental results. These bonds
show enhanced ionicity when the EEF is oriented in one direction,
and in the reverse EEF direction, the ionicity is quenched.1,4,30

Besides its polarity, the
magnitude of the substrate bias also
controls the composition of the monolayer phases. In the experiments
described so far, only the sign of the substrate bias was changed
from negative to positive and vice versa (typically
from −1 to +1 V). A threshold for the observed structural transitions
was discovered when the substrate bias was changed gradually in increments
of 200 mV from −1 to +1 V. Figure 5 shows voltage magnitude-dependent structural
transitions in the case of cocrystal A. 2D cocrystal A remains stable
in the voltage window of −1.0 to −0.2 V (Figure 5a). Further changes in the
substrate bias lead to formation of another cocrystal network, which
remains stable within the voltage range of 0.0 to 0.2 V (cocrystal
E, Figure 5b). Additional
increase in the field strength furnished the final structure in the
form of cocrystal B, which remains stable within the voltage window
of 0.4 to 1.0 V (Figure 5c). The anatomy of cocrystal E is consistent with disruption of hydrogen
bonding between two TMA molecules in the original structure. The magnitude
dependence of the transition can thus alternatively be understood
by considering gradual deprotonation of the TMA molecules as a function
of increase in the field strength on the positive side of the substrate
bias. These systematic measurements reveal that neither of the supramolecular
networks observed at positive (+1 V) or negative (−1 V) bias
are stable at or around 0 V when the field is weak or completely removed.
The observation of the distorted network indicating partial disruption
of regular hydrogen bonding between the two molecules indicates that
the partially deprotonated species may be present on the surface at
or around zero field.

transition

E (b). Panels (d)–(f) show corresponding molecular models.
Unit cell parameters for cocrystal (E) are a = 4.2
± 0.1 nm, b = 4.2 ± 0.2 nm, and α
= 74 ± 2°. Tunneling current (a–c) Iset = 60 pA.

At first sight it appears rather counterintuitive that the
networks
change from open porous at negative bias to compact at positive bias.
This is because, if one assumes partial deprotonation of the molecules,
then one expects repulsive interactions within the network formed
at positive bias. While this is true to a large extent, it must be
noted that all the open porous networks discussed here are sustained
by six hydrogen bonds per molecule. Despite their open nature, which
does not conform to the thermodynamic principle of close-packing,
the stability of such networks is governed by maximization of energy
per molecule, in which case each molecule forms six energetically
favorable hydrogen bonds with its neighbor. Disruption of such R22(8) hydrogen bonding is expected to significantly
reduce the stability of the open porous network. Under such circumstances,
not only the overall energy of the supramolecular surface is determined
by close packing wherein the energy per unit area dominates, but the
carboxylate ion formed after (partial) deprotonation may also engage
in hydrogen bonding with intact carboxyl groups. A hydrogen bond formed
between carboxylate ions and carboxyl groups is known to be extremely
strong and is categorized as a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB).32−34 Such bonds are typically shorter (2.3–2.5 Å, bond strength
∼37 kcal/mol)33 than regular hydrogen
bonds (>2.6 Å, bond strength ∼7.4 kcal/mol)35 formed between carboxyl groups. In the case
of an LBHB, the hydrogen atom occupies a position approximately equidistant
from the two oxygen atoms and is equally shared between the donor
and the acceptor. The role of such strong ionic hydrogen bonds in
stabilizing reaction intermediates within the active sites of enzymes
is an intensely debated topic.33,36 Carboxylates are discussed
prominently in this context because all negative charges on proteins
are carboxylates.32,37,38 Based on these aspects, it is not unreasonable to consider formation
of strong hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate anions and carboxyl
groups which may contribute to the overall stabilization of the networks
formed at positive substrate bias. This means that the apparent carboxyl–carboxyl
contacts present in the networks obtained at positive bias (vide supra) could as well be ascribed to carboxyl–carboxylate
hydrogen bonding instead of regular R22(8) carboxyl–carboxyl
hydrogen bonding. The chemical insensitivity of scanning tunneling
microscopy precludes the determination of the exact sites where the
plausible deprotonation has occurred. Nevertheless, the structures
formed at positive substrate bias can be interpreted by considering
the aforementioned carboxylate–carboxyl hydrogen bonding, and
hypothetical models based on such consideration can be found in the
Supporting Information (Figures S11 and S12).

Host–Guest System: Coronene@Cocrystal D
Finally,
we tested how the presence of guest molecules affects the EEF-induced
phase behavior in BTB–TMA monolayers. We have recently demonstrated
the potential use of a similar switching process for controlled release
and capture of molecular guests at the solution–solid interface.14 EEF-induced porous to compact transitions in
the BTB network were used to “squeeze” out guest molecules
adsorbed in its open cavities. The two polycyclic aromatic molecules,
namely, coronene and nanographene, adsorb in the host cavities of
the BTB network at negative substrate polarity and could be expelled
out of the network by reversing the polarity, which leads to formation
of the compact network. The presence of guest molecules did not impede
the process, and the EEF-induced structural transitions in the BTB
network were found to proceed as readily as that in the absence of
guest molecules. A recent study also found similar behavior where
the structural transitions in the BTB network were barely slowed down
by incorporation of a variety of different guest molecules.39

Cocrystal D was chosen to evaluate the
impact of guest molecules on the switching process, as it features
well-ordered TMA hexagons within the lattice that are known to be
ideal host cavities for COR.40 Addition
of a droplet of COR dissolved in HA to a preformed monolayer of cocrystal
D resulted in formation of a perfectly ordered, three-component host–guest
network where COR occupies the TMA hexagons. A similar result is obtained
upon premixing the three components in solution. The STM image provided
in Figure 6a clearly
shows the presence of COR as bright disc-shaped features inside the
TMA cavities. The adsorption of COR neither changes the lattice parameters
nor changes the way BTB and TMA interact with each other. Reversing
the polarity led to a somewhat unusual outcome wherein the host–guest
network consisting of TMA and COR remains on the surface with markedly
reduced surface coverage of BTB at positive polarity. TMA forms the
“flower” structure20 at positive
substrate bias with a few COR molecules incorporated in the hexagonal
cavities. It must be noted that in the absence of COR this system
evolves into an amorphous network at positive substrate bias (see Figure 4). What is even more
interesting is that further reversal of the substrate bias to negative
values does not furnish the initial three-component host–guest
system. Instead, a regular honeycomb network of TMA with COR guests
is obtained with virtually complete removal of BTB from the scanned
surface. Further scanning the same area at negative substrate polarity
does not change the surface composition. Thus, the reversibility of
the structural transition is completely altered in the presence of
COR molecules, which preferentially stabilize the TMA network due
to ideal host–guest interactions at both positive and negative
substrate bias. This is an interesting case where an otherwise (thermodynamically)
stable cocrystal is converted into a metastable state upon EEF-induced
switching (also see Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information). Similar behavior was observed in the case of porous
networks formed by TMA and 4,4′-bipyridine. When COR was introduced
into the system, 4,4′-bipyridine was removed from the surface
with exclusive formation of a TMA–COR network.41

Figure 6 Influence of guest molecules on EEF-induced structural transitions.
(a) STM image of the three-component system obtained by adding COR
to a preformed monolayer of cocrystal D. COR molecules selectively
occupy the small hexagonal cavities. (b) Molecular model corresponding
to the STM image provided in (a). (c) STM image of the network obtained
after reversing the polarity. This network resembles the flower structure
of the TMA with very low surface coverage of BTB molecules that form
an amorphous network in between the TMA–COR host–guest
structure. This network does not revert back to the original three-component
BTB–TMA–COR system upon reversing the substrate bias
to negative. Instead, it leads to formation of a TMA–COR host–guest
network (d, e) wherein TMA forms a regular honeycomb network. (For
a large-scale image of the three-component system and for the time-dependence
of the transition see Supporting Information Figure S9 and Figure S10, respectively.)

Conclusions and Outlook
Using a combination of supramolecular
chemistry, surface science,
and STM, we have described above how changing the orientation of a
strong, highly localized electric field affects the mixing behavior
of two molecules adsorbed at the solution–solid interface within
the tunneling junction. Two molecules that form cocrystalline physisorbed
monolayers based on hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxyl
groups respond in a reversible fashion to the change in the direction
of an EEF. The starting surface composition dictates the final outcome
upon reversing the field direction. We essentially show that by using
EEFs one can control, in a spatially controlled fashion, how two molecules
interact with each other. The approach presented here illustrates
yet another interesting manifestation of strong EEFs on (supra)molecular
systems.

While the highly resolved STM data clearly show drastic
changes
in the structure and composition of the supramolecular networks in
response to changes in the orientation of the EEF, pinpointing the
exact reason behind those changes is not straightforward due to the
extremely localized nature of the process. We have discussed two possibilities,
namely, changes in the surface dipole and partial deprotonation of
the molecules. We note that the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.
We hypothesize that EEF-induced partial deprotonation of the two molecules
could be the reason behind the field-controlled mixing behavior. This
hypothesis is supported by recent theoretical studies that indicate
that strong EEFs influence bond energy and are thus capable of causing
bond cleavage. Although STM is an excellent experimental tool to study
EEF-induced processes, we concede that it is limited by its lack of
chemical sensitivity. While a number of mechanistic details still
need to be verified experimentally, this work provides a compelling
example of electric-field-controlled mixing behavior of surface-adsorbed
supramolecular systems.

Experimental study of strong EEF-induced
processes at the single-molecule
level is still a fairly unchartered territory, and a number of aspects
remain unknown. The influence of the EEF in the present case is localized
within a few square nanometers underneath the STM tip. Alternative
strategies are needed in order to carry out EEF-induced chemical reactions
on a preparative scale, which will determine if EEF-induced processes
could be profitably employed in synthesis and/or separation technology.
For a fundamental understanding of chemical changes occurring in such
systems in response to EEFs, a combination of spectroscopy and microscopy
needs to be employed. Further attempts to find evidence of deprotonation
in the current system are underway using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

Experimental Section
Commercially
available BTB (Aldrich 98+%), TMA (98%), COR (Aldrich
97%), and heptanoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich ≥99%) were used as
received. Stock solutions of BTB (1.4 × 10–3 M), TMA (4.8 × 10–3 M), and COR (2.0 ×
10–3 M) were prepared by dissolving an appropriate
amount of solid in 1-heptanoic acid. The stock solutions were diluted
further to make concentration series. All STM experiments were performed
at room temperature (21–23 °C) using a PicoLE (Agilent)
machine operating in constant-current mode with the tip immersed in
the supernatant liquid. STM tips were prepared by mechanically cutting
a Pt/Ir wire (80%/20%, diameter 0.2 mm). Prior to imaging, a drop
of solution was placed onto a freshly cleaved surface of highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (grade ZYB, Advanced Ceramics Inc., Cleveland,
OH, USA). The experiments were repeated in two or three sessions using
different tips to check for reproducibility and to avoid experimental
artifacts, if any. For analysis purposes, recording of a monolayer
image was followed by imaging the graphite substrate underneath it
under the same experimental conditions, except for increasing the
current and lowering the bias. Raw STM images of the molecular monolayers
were calibrated by using the STM images of the HOPG lattice obtained
immediately after recording the monolayer image as a reference. This
exercise removes the distortions in the STM images that arise due
to thermal drift. The lattice parameters of bimolecular monolayer
were then obtained from these calibrated images. Scanning probe image
processor (SPIP) software (Image Metrology ApS) was used for image
calibration. The unit cell parameters were determined by examining
at least four images, and only the average values are reported. The
images are Gaussian filtered. The imaging parameters are indicated
in the figure caption: tunneling current (Iset) and sample bias (Vbias). After the
determination of the unit cell from drift-corrected STM images, a
molecular model of the observed monolayer was constructed using the
HyperChem Professional 7.5 program. First, a molecular model for each
single molecule was built, and then this model was geometry optimized
under vacuum using molecular mechanics optimization (Fletcher–Reeves
algorithm with an RMS gradient of 0.1 kcal/Å mol). Following
this, a 2D crystal based on unit cell parameters obtained from calibrated
STM images was built by duplicating, translating, and rotating the
molecules at the lattice sites. The orientation of adjacent molecules
with respect to each other was defined on the basis of supramolecular
intuition and prior knowledge on carboxylic acid self-assembly from
published literature.
