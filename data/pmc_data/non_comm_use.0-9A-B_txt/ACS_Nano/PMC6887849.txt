Single-molecule studies
have provided a wealth of insight into
the photophysics of conjugated polymers in the solid and desolvated
state. Desolvating conjugated chains, e.g., by their embedding in inert solid matrices, invariably leads to
chain collapse and the formation of intermolecular aggregates, which
have a pronounced effect on their properties. By contrast, the luminescent
properties of individual semiconducting polymers in their solvated
and thermodynamic state remain largely unexplored. In this paper,
we demonstrate a versatile gel trapping technique that enables the
chemistry-free immobilization and interrogation of individual conjugated
macromolecules, which retain a fully equilibrated conformation by
contrast to conventional solid-state immobilization methods. We show
how the technique can be used to record full luminescence spectra
of single chains, to evaluate their time-resolved fluorescence, and
to probe their photodynamics. Finally, we explore how the photophysics
of different conjugated polymers is strongly affected by desolvation
and chain collapse.

==== Body
Conjugated
polymers, macromolecules
with a semiconducting backbone, have been studied extensively in the
past decades. Until very recently, the main interest in this class
of luminescent macromolecules was in the creation of solid-state optoelectronic
materials and devices, such as photovoltaics,1−3 light-emitting
diodes,4−8 and memories.9−11 More recently, it has become clear that the delicate
coupling between chain conformation and photophysical properties of
these chains can be exploited in solution to create sensitive optical
molecular sensors,12−17 for example to accurately detect enzymatic proteolysis,18 reveal the presence of small quantities of nucleic
acid polymers,13,19,20 or illuminate the pathways of protein self-assembly.12,21 Very recently, our group has demonstrated that the coupling of emission
patterns to chain conformation can even be used to create ultrasensitive
molecular tension sensors, which can reveal sub-picoNewton forces
down to the scale of single macromolecular chains.22

Single-molecule luminescence spectroscopy has been
an extraordinarily
valuable tool to elucidate the complex photophysics of semiconducting
polymers.23−28 To interrogate a single semiconducting chain, it needs to be immobilized,
to prevent diffusion of the chain away from the interrogation window,
and separated from neighboring chains, to ensure that the optical
information that is obtained derives from an isolated and single chain
only. Conventionally, this is done by embedding the conjugated polymer
of interest at very low concentrations in a nonfluorescent and optically
transparent solid matrix, e.g.,
in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene, or Zeonex.26,27,29−31 Samples are
typically prepared by drop casting or spin coating, during which a
common solvent for matrix and semiconducting polymer evaporates and
traps the conjugated chains in the glassy matrix. Invariably, the
removal of the good solvent, desolvation of the chains, and increasing
interactions between the two macromolecular species lead to the formation
of a variety of nonequilibrium collapsed conformations, characterized
by a strongly heterogeneous population,23,27,32 the formation of π-stacked aggregates,33−35 complex intermolecular charge transfer processes, and intermittent
photodynamics.29,36 The nonequilibrium state of the
polymer chains in this approach is further evidenced by the fact that
the photophysics of the chains shows a strong sensitivity to the processing
and annealing conditions31,37,38 and choice of matrix.23,26,36,39

By contrast, in single-molecule
experiments on biomolecules, where
solvation is crucial for molecular function, immobilization is often
achieved by means of interfacial attachment using methods from surface
chemistry.40−42 Only very recently has this approach been applied
to probe the photodynamics of single conjugated polymer chains of
polythiophene.43 Yet, this approach is
experimentally taxing, as it requires chemical modification of the
macromolecular species of interest in a dedicated synthesis and passivization
of the surface, which is challenging for semiconducting polymers that
have strong interactions with solid surfaces.44 Moreover, the coupling of polymer chains to solid substrates is
known to affect their conformation and conformational dynamics.45−47 These limitations and the growing interest in solution-based diagnostics
using semiconducting polymers pose the need for approaches to evaluate
the full photophysics of semiconducting polymers in a solvated state.
This raises two distinct requirements: first, solvent exchange dynamics
must be rapid to mimic the pure solvent surroundings of diagnostic
experiments while, second, restricting the center-of-mass motion of
chains sufficiently, without the necessity for chemical modification
of the chains and free from the potential perturbations caused by
solid substrates.

In this paper, we present a simple and versatile
gel trapping method
that enables the study of single semiconducting polymers in their
native solvated state, without requiring chemical modification of
the chains and their anchoring to solid surfaces. We show how the
macromolecule center-of-mass motion is restricted, while allowing
rapid diffusion of small molecules, such as solvent, and how the method
can be readily applied to different conjugated polymers without requiring
chemical modification. We exemplify that it can be used to record
complete luminescence spectra of individual semiconducting chains
and measure their excited-state lifetime and photodynamics. We find
that desolvation has a drastic effect on both the mean photophysical
properties and the population heterogeneity, which is attributed to
the nonequilibrium conformations that emerge during chain collapse.
Finally, we employ this method to explore the origin of large-intensity
jumps often observed in the emission of a prototypical organic emitter,
poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV).
These intermittent photodynamics are sometimes attributed to emergent
quenching chromophores that form during chain aggregation.23,26 Our results show that there is no strong apparent correlation between
solvation quality and the extent of these intermittent intensity fluctuations.
Our approach offers a simple yet versatile platform for the immobilization
and optical interrogation of luminescent macromolecules in a thermodynamically
equilibrated state.

Results and Discussion
In our search
for a facile method to immobilize semiconducting
polymers while allowing continuous solvent exchange, we study two
different semiconducting polymers. The first is MEH-PPV, whose absorption
and emission spectra are shown in Figure 1a, a well-studied and prototypic organic
semiconductor.23,26,36 The second is an acceptor-doped polyfluorene, which we have previously
shown to be suited as a molecular tension sensor,22 which exhibits both donor emission in the blue and acceptor
emission in the red (Figure 1b). To immobilize these chains while allowing them to retain
a solvated state and rapid solvent exchange, we trap the semiconducting
polymers in a solvent-swollen gel made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).
These trapping gels are optically transparent, exhibit a pore size
that can be tuned by the cross-linking density, and can be prepared
and swollen in a variety of common solvents for both PDMS and semiconducting
polymers, such as toluene, chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran (THF).48

The liquid precursor of the PDMS gel and a minute amount of conjugated
polymer are dissolved together in a common solvent of choice; this
liquid is loaded into a glass sample chamber, which is hermetically
sealed to avoid solvent evaporation; within a few hours, the gel network
polymerizes around the semiconducting polymers, forming a porous solvogel
as the trapping matrix. These gels contain 50 wt % solvent and 50
wt % PDMS chains with an estimated network mesh size of ∼10
nm, based on the density of cross-links formed. To verify the suppression
of center-of-mass diffusion of the chains, we perform a fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment on a solvogel with
a large concentration of conjugated polymers; indeed, no recovery
of the luminescence occurs in the bleached zone, even after 30 min
(Figure 1c). This indicates
the effective suppression of macromolecular diffusion within the gel.
By contrast, the same experiment repeated with a low molecular weight
fluorophore, with dimensions of the order-of-magnitude of the solvent,
reveals a very rapid recovery of fluorescence within several seconds
(Figure 1d). Thus,
while the gel traps the larger macromolecular chains, small molecules,
such as solvent, can freely diffuse throughout the matrix (see SI for control measurements in a solid matrix).
This is in line with previous observation that solvent dynamics in
gels with sufficiently large pore sizes is virtually unhindered.49

Since each semiconducting macromolecule
contains multiple chromophores,
we use the established approach of a linear scaling between number
of spots and concentration to establish the concentration limit in
which the chains are well-dispersed and can be observed in isolation.22,29 We record diffraction-limited images (Figure 1e,f) of the two different conjugated polymers
embedded in the gel matrix on a home-built hyperspectral confocal
laser scanning microscope (see SI). We
find a linear relationship in the number of spots counted per frame
and the concentration when the conjugated polymer concentration in
the gel remains <50 pM; in our experiments we work well within
this regime at 10 pM (see Figure 1g).

We commence our exploration by studying the
effect of solvation
on the photophysics of the well-studied conjugated polymer MEH-PPV
(Figure 1a). It is
well-known that MEH-PPV emission is sensitive to the local environment.23,32,35 For single diffraction-limited
images of an individual MEH-PPV chain, we record a full luminescence
spectrum with a spectral resolution of ∼1 nm (see Experimental Details and SI). We find that the luminescence spectra of single chains trapped
in their gel matrix (example shown in Figure 2a, additional spectra shown in the SI) are very comparable to ensemble-averaged
emission spectra recorded in toluene solutions on a fluorescence spectrometer.
They exhibit peak emission at ∼540 nm and show distinct vibronic
transitions, which are also visible in the single-molecule spectra
as a shoulder at ∼600 nm. To exemplify the effects of desolvation
on MEH-PPV photophysics, we take these same samples and remove the
toluene from the solvogel to result in desolvated conjugated polymers
trapped in an inert matrix. This results in two distinct changes in
the single-molecule spectra (Figure 2b; for additional spectra see SI, including a comparison to MEH-PPV in solid-state PMMA). First,
we observe that the emission maximum is blue-shifted by approximately
30–40 nm; as the solvent is removed, the chains undergo intramolecular
collapse, which introduces additional curvature in the backbone and
reduces their conjugation length (blue shaded are in Figure 2c).32,35,50

state in the toluene/PDMS gel trapping matrix (a) in the same matrix
after removal of all solvent (b). (c) Comparison of emission spectra
in solvated and desolvated states, indicating two regions where desolvation
leads to changes in the photophysics: blue-shaded region indicates
a blue-shift in the emission maximum upon desolvation, whereas the
red-shaded region highlights the emergence of aggregate emission in
the red. (d, e) Probability distribution of emission maximum λpeak in the solvated (d) and desolvated state (e). (f, g) Probability
distribution of the integrated emission from the aggregate band (between
650 and 700 nm), normalized to the peak intensity, for solvated (f)
and desolvated (g) samples.

Second, we observe the appearance of a red emission band (red-shaded
area in Figure 2c).
This has been extensively described in the literature, in particular
at low temperatures, in both experiments and simulations.50−52 The appearance of this red emission band is ascribed to increased
ordering within the chain, which increases the conjugation length.
Köhler etal. describe these
phenomena as a second-order phase transition that occurs within MEH-PPV
chains.50 A threshold local segment density
of MEH-PPV is necessary to trigger this transition,50−52 which could
explain the emergence of the red emission in our experiments. Removal
of toluene from our solvogel while MEH-PPV remains trapped in the
PDMS mesh will lead to chain collapse and the growth of unfavorable
interactions with the PDMS matrix. Since this collapse leads to an
increase in the local segmental density within the coil, this could
trigger the formation of a more ordered state from the disordered
equilibrium conformation of the polymer in solution. We observe both
increased blue emission and increased red emission within single chains,
suggesting that both sharp turns within the polymer occur and longer,
ordered regions are formed due to collapse, all in an effort to minimize
the exposed polymer contact area.50

To quantify these changes, we record single-molecule spectra for
a large number of individual chains (N = 201 for
solvated and N = 138 for desolvated chains) and extract
the wavelength of maximum emission. Histograms of the emission maximum
show a clear shift of 40 nm in the emission maximum as a result of
solvent removal (Figure 2d,e). To quantify the emergent red emission, we measure the integrated
red emission between 650 and 700 nm, normalized to the overall emission
intensity. Also here, we see a substantial increase in emission as
a result of desolvation, comprising as much as 50% of the total emitted
intensity (Figure 2f,g). These results indicate not only that desolvation has a drastic
effect on the photophysics of the semiconducting chains but that intramolecular
ordering and collapse are effectively suppressed in our gel trapping
approach.

Since our gel trapping approach is suitable to any
semiconducting
polymer that has a common solvent with our PDMS solvogel and that
is large enough to become trapped in the network pores, we can readily
apply the same approach to different chemistries, without the need
for any chemical modifications of the polymers under study to enable
surface immobilization. The effect of solvation on chain conformation
becomes even more apparent in acceptor-doped semiconducting polymers,19,53 previously used as a molecular tension sensor.22 Our design consists of a donor backbone of dialkylfluorene,
doped with a minority fraction of the red-emitting acceptor dithienyl
benzothiadiazole (DTBT) (Figure 1b).

In a swollen and solvated state, these semiflexible
polymers adopt
a coiled conformation, in which the local segmental density is relatively
low (Figure 3a) and
should exhibit a Gaussian distribution. This should lead to a low
energy transfer efficiency between fluorene donors and DTBT acceptors
with a normal distribution. As the chain collapses, the local segmental
density increases and becomes more inhomogeneous, thereby increasing
the efficiency of energy transfer and population heterogeneity22 (Figure 3b,c). These molecular sensors probe changes in chain conformation
at the scale of the energy transfer radius R0. As such, these doped conjugated polymers are very sensitive
to not only mechanical strain but also the solvency of their local
environment. This should provide additional proof that our gel trapping
method allows us to interrogate single conjugated polymers in truly
solvated conditions.

a desolvated PDMS matrix, and (j–l) a solvated toluene/PDMS

(indicated in g), which corresponds to the Raman shift of the PDMS
chains.54 (m–o) Probability distributions

(m) solid polystyrene film, (n) desolvated PDMS, and (o) solvated
PDMS/toluene gel.

To probe the effects
of desolvation on the chain conformations,
we compare three different scenarios: (i) embedding in a polystyrene
matrix, spin-coated from toluene, (ii) embedding in a desolvated gel,
prepared by evaporating the toluene after preparation, and (iii) embedding
in the solvated PDMS–toluene gel. Example single-molecule spectra
for each of these matrices are shown in Figure 3d–i. We note that all spectra recorded
in a PDMS matrix, either solvated or free from toluene, contain a
sharp Raman scattering peak around 450 nm, corresponding to the Raman
shift of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) chains54 in response to the excitation laser. We interpolate our data across
this sharp Raman peak for further data analysis. As in our previous
work,22 we integrate the donor and acceptor
emission intensity, ID and IA, to obtain a ratiometric measure for the intrachain
energy transfer efficiency, expressed as E = IA/ID + IA. We extract these data from single-molecule spectra
for N ≈ 200 individual measurements for each
of the three matrices. Energy transfer histograms reveal exactly what
we speculated to occur above. Desolvation leads to a substantially
higher intrachain energy transfer efficiency, due to chain collapse
and the associated increase in local segmental density. Interestingly,
the nonthermodynamic state of the desolvated versus the thermodynamic conformations of the solvated chains becomes apparent
when considering the shape of the distributions. For solvated samples,
the segmental density should be Gaussian, reflected as a Gaussian
distribution of the energy transfer probability P(E) (Figure 3o). By contrast, chain collapse is a probabilistic phenomenon
characterized by the emergence of kinetically trapped aggregated states,
which lead to a wide distribution of segmental densities, and thus
a broad distribution in P(E) (Figure 3m,n). To further
study the effect of solvency on single-chain conformation, we compare
our data on PF8-DTBT solvated in a toluene/PDMS matrix, which represents
good solvent conditions, with measurements of this same polymer in
a cyclohexane/toluene/PDMS matrix, at a 1:4 ratio of poor (cyclohexane)
and good solvent (toluene) (see SI for
details). Changing the solvency of the swelling fluid for the conjugated
chains leads to a shift of E to much larger values,
as expected for chains that approach their theta-point and deswell
(see Figure S6) while retaining a narrow
distribution that signals an equilibrium state. Interestingly, we
note that this scenario is still distinctly different from truly collapsed
chains in a solid matrix, where the population heterogeneity is substantially
enlarged (as evidenced in Figure 3m,n).

These two experiments highlight that our
approach is capable of
immobilizing chains without affecting their thermodynamic state and
that this has a pronounced effect on the polymer photophysics as compared
to studies in solid matrices. To further substantiate this claim,
we also perform time-resolved fluorescence experiments on MEH-PPV
chains.

We measure the fluorescence lifetime of individual chains
using
fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM, see Experimental
Details for details) on MEH-PPV chains either spin-coated in
PMMA from toluene, as is conventionally done to prepare samples for
single-molecule spectroscopy, or fully solvated in our gel trapping
system. We chose to compare lifetimes of our solvated system to lifetimes
of MEH-PPV embedded in PMMA, as this allows for a more direct comparison
to literature values. In solution, ensemble-averaged measurements
of the excited-state lifetime of conjugated polymers tend to show
very short lifetimes (0.2–0.5 ns for MEH-PPV), while these
can be substantially larger in a desolvated state, embedded in a solid
and glassy matrix. Measured lifetimes in these solid matrices can
range from sub-nanosecond (0.5 ns on average51) to lifetimes of 1 ns and larger, both in ensemble-averaged and
single-molecule studies.36,55−57

With FLIM, we record lifetime images containing tens to hundreds
of diffraction-limited single-molecule spots (Figure 4e). We use object identification algorithms
to find the centroid of each single spot and extract its time-resolved
fluorescence trace. We observe strong differences between fluorescence
decay curves recorded in a desolvated PMMA matrix (Figure 4a,b) and those recorded for
single polymers in their solvated state (Figure 4c,d). We note that the differences in photon
counts between the desolvated and solvated matrices arise from the
strong decrease in quantum yield of MEH-PPV upon embedding in a solid
matrix. The quantum yield for MEH-PPV in PMMA is 0.1,26 while the quantum yield of MEH-PPV in solution is 0.55.58 With constant integration time and excitation
flux, such a reduction in quantum yield would result in substantially
lower photon count. For desolvated chains, we find a single-exponential
decay of a few nanoseconds, while for solvated chains the decay is
more rapid and has a more complex multiexponential shape. We find
that for solvated chains these curves are well described by a double-exponential
decay. By fitting the decay curves for thousands of measurements on
single molecules, we can reconstruct lifetime distribution histograms
with high statistical certainty. The solvated chains show two distinct
populations in their lifetime distribution P(⟨τ⟩),
which is well-described by a double Gaussian, with characteristic
decay times of ⟨τ⟩ = 0.3 ns and ⟨τ⟩
= 0.5 ns (N = 2025 chains). These values correspond
well to those reported for ensemble-averaged measurements on MEH-PPV
in solution.55,56,59 The bimodal lifetime distribution that we observe is unexpected
based on previous experiments in the solid state, but as these are
lifetimes for single solvated chains, there is no reference data to
benchmark these against. We note that both populations are below the
mean fluoresence lifetime of single chains in PMMA.60 This implies that the secondary peak in the lifetime distribution
for the solvated chains is most likely not due to single-chain aggregates
that have remained in solution (which is further confirmed by Figure 2). Thus, the bimodal
lifetime distribution we observe, of spots that all feature an MEH-PPV
characteristic emission spectrum, is most likely not aggregates. Rather,
we may speculate that it originates in the fact that single solvated
chains exhibit multiple decay pathways of the excited state; this
is also manifest in the shape of the single-molecule intensity decay
curves (Figure 4c,d),
which exhibits two exponential decays at the same characteristic lifetimes.
We believe these may be due to the much larger conformational and
vibrational freedom of chains in a solvated state, where not only
small-scale molecular fluctuations can occur but conformational relaxation
of the chains as a whole is also possible. These shape fluctuations
not only drastically reduce the mean lifetime but also give rise to
stronger effects of polydispersity since the conformation relaxation
of chains is strongly length-dependent. However, we cannot fully exclude
the effect of nanoaggregation of small and rodlike chains in the polydisperse
mixture, of which the secondary lifetime peak could be a result. Based
on work by Wang etal.61 it could be possible that no good solvent for
MEH-PPV exists, and that as such, nanoaggregation cannot be suppressed
even in highly dilute solutions. By contrast, we find a single broad
distribution of lifetimes for chains in a static PMMA matrix, with
⟨τ⟩ = 2.1 ns (N = 2371 chains).
While the average value we find is slightly higher than what is usually
reported in the literature,36,57 it is established that
low molecular weight MEH-PPV oligomers can have lifetimes of up to
5 ns62 as the result of nanoaggregration.
Our sample is highly polydisperse and thus contains a substantial
amount of low molecular weight oligomers. During spin coating and
film solidification, long and short chains of MEH-PPV exhibit vastly
different transport rates, and it is thus possible that even at the
very low concentrations we employ aggregation occurs for short chains
of MEH-PPV. The presence of nanoaggregrates of short chains would
explain the skew in our lifetime data for MEH-PPV in solid PMMA. To
further substantiate this hypothesis, we perform a correlation analysis
by plotting the excited-state lifetime as a function of intensity
for each diffraction-limited spot in our experiments. For the solid-state
sample, the resulting correlation plot, displayed as an intensity
map (Figure 4h), shows
a distinct correlation between lifetime and intensity, which is in
accord with the picture that larger oligomer nanoaggregates exhibit
larger fluorescence lifetimes.62 This correlation
is absent for the solvated sample (Figure 4i), which further confirms that these aggregates
are absent in this case.

Having established that
our gel trapping approach enables the optical
interrogation of single conjugated polymers in a solvent-swollen and
nonaggregated conformation, we now show the value of our approach
by addressing a long-standing issue in the photodynamics of MEH-PPV.
Upon continuous excitation, the emission intensity from single MEH-PPV
chains can show strongly intermittent behavior characterized by distinct
intensity jumps,23,36,43,63 while other chains within the same sample
show more “regular” temporal intensity traces, characterized
by smoother exponential decay of the intensity due to gradual photooxidation
of the multichromophore system within a single chain. The origin of
these erratic photodynamics has been a topic of detailed study.23,25,26,29,36,39,43,64 One hypothesis is that
this blinking results from the formation of quenching sites due to
chain aggregation resulting in transient dark states that can last
from milliseconds to many minutes.23,36,43 Aggregated regions within the chain, in which π–π
interactions are strong, promote fast exciton transport and through-space
quenching.23,36,65

As we have shown above, the chains embedded in toluene swollen
gels do not exhibit any of the features of intrachain aggregates and
can thus be assumed to be largely aggregate free. By contrast, the
same chains in a desolvated solid matrix show strong signs of aggregate
emission (Figure 2).
This thus enables us to compare the photodynamics in the limits of
no and strong aggregation. Interestingly, we find that in both cases
two types of emission intensity traces are observed (Figure 5a–h): those that exhibit
large intensity jumps and those in which photo-oxidation provides
an exponential decay of the luminescence intensity. To perform statistics
on these observations, we record these single-molecule intensity traces
for a large number of chains and categorize the traces into two categories
(see Experimental Details for details): (i)
intermittent and (ii) smooth exponential decay. We find that solvated
in toluene, or desolvated in a solid PMMA matrix spin-coated from
toluene, the relative occurrence of these intermittent traces is the
same, within experimental noise (Figure 5i).

gel. (i) Fraction of total traces that display intermittency (bottom
fractions) versus regular exponential photobleacing

intensity traces shown in a–h.

Our data show no apparent effect of solvation quality, and the
emergence of intermittent intensity jumps under continuous excitation.
This could be interpreted in one of two ways. Either, there is no
correlation between the aggregation state of the chains and these
unusual photophysics, as has been suggested in some cases previously,23,26,36,66 or aggregates remain present in all solvents, as work by Wang etal. has shown that there might be no
good solvent possible for MEH-PPV.61 This
is in line with the hypothesis above of the presence of small nanoaggregates
resulting in a two-population behavior in the lifetime distributions.
This would suggest that any differences we observe between toluene,
chloroform, and THF (see Figure 5i) could still be caused by aggregation effects, as
there is no nonaggregation state to benchmark against. On the basis
of the work by Wang etal. we would
expect MEH-PPV in chloroform or toluene to be in very similar conformations
(with hydrodynamic radius versus molecular weight
scaling exponents of 0.41 and 0.4, respectively, below Θ = 0.5
expected from Flory–Huggins theory for good solvents). For
THF we would expect even worse solvency,50 but such an effect does not present itself in our data (see Figure 5i). Clearly, the
link between conformation of MEH-PPV and solvent quality is one that
requires further study to clarify fully.

Conclusions
In
this paper we have presented a simple yet versatile approach
to enable the optical interrogation of single conjugated polymers
in their thermodynamic state. We have shown how chains trapped in
a gel matrix, which restricts center-of-mass motion of larger macromolecules
but leaves solvent transport unaffected, exhibit more homogeneous
photophysical populations and lack the signs of intramolecular aggregation,
which complicates a detailed analysis of such studies in the solid
state. The trapping method enables a wide variety of different single-molecule
methods to be employed, including emission spectroscopy, fluorescence
lifetime analysis, and single-chain photodynamics. Our method could
also be extended to study single-molecule behavior under the influence
of external fields, which could shed light on the effect of chain
morphology on charge transport and mobility.67 By embedding the entire sample in a sample chamber consisting of
at least one optically transparent electrode would in principle allow
the simultaneous read-out using methods detailed in our paper and
the application of electric fields. It is also possible to extend
our method of gel trapping to completely different matrix compositions.
For instance, for the entrapment of water-soluble fluorescent polymers
or proteins, a polyacrylamide matrix could be employed using the same
principles as described in this paper.

We have adopted our approach
to shed light on the debate regarding
the origins of intermittent intensity jumps in the emission of MEH-PPV.
While it was previously assumed that this intermittency must originate
from intrachain aggregates, we find no correlation between aggregation
state and the abundance of emitters that exhibit such large fluctuations.
Our results thus hint that the origins of this photophysical intermittency
must lie elsewhere. The study of single-molecule photophysics of MEH-PPV
in this study is performed on highly polydisperse samples obtained
commercially; while not uncommom,26,36 multiple studies
on MEH-PPV and other polymers have shown chain length dependent differences
when these conjugated polymers are further fractionated into more
monodisperse fractions using GPC or other fractionation methods.61,68−70 These results could indicate that chain length will
also influence this intermittency. For chain lengths greater than
200 kDa, no substantial length effects have been observed,69 but commercial samples also contain a large
fraction of much shorter oligomers that approach the conjugation length,
whose role is important but not fully clarified.36 It is also conceivable that intrinsic chemical defects
in the chains, thus being a property of their chemical architecture
and not only their conformation, play a role in these features.34 Only very recently has single-chain defect analysis
become experimentally tractable, which could potentially aid in resolving
this problem.71

Experimental
Details
A detailed description of data analysis routines,
including additional
data, can be found in the SI. Analysis
routines, implemented in Matlab, are available on request from the
authors.

Conjugated Polymers
MEH-PPV was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
with a molecular weight of 40–70 kDa (PDI ≈ 6).

Poly(fluorene-co-DTBT) was prepared by standard
Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura polycondensation.72 In short, 4224 mg (7.7 mmol) of 9,9-si-(2′-ethylhexyl)-2,7-dibromofluorene,
4915 mg (8.8 mmol) of 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid-bis(1,3-propanediol)ester,
and 504 mg (1.1 mmol) of 7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
were dissolved in 125 mL of toluene, to which was added 75 mL of 2
M K2CO3. Here we use an acceptor doping of 1:15.
A small amount of Aliquat 336 was added to the reaction as a phase
transfer catalyst. The solution was degassed by bubbling with nitrogen
under vigorous stirring followed by five vacuum/nitrogen cycles. A
250 mg amount of the catalyst Pd(dppf)Cl2 was added under
a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask was sealed and left under vacuum;
the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 days at 85 °C. The
polymer was end-capped using phenylboronic acid (300 mg, in degassed
toluene), and end-capping was allowed to proceed overnight. Finally
2 mL of degassed bromobenzene was added and reacted overnight to finalize
the end-capping procedure. The conjugated polymer was purified by
precipitation in 1:1:1 acetone/H2O/1 M HCl. The purple
solid was collected and dried. This product was further cleaned by
Soxhlet extraction against methanol for 2 days and against acetone
for 2 days. The product was extracted against chloroform and precipitated
in methanol. The final yield was 78% (4.22 g). Molecular weight and
polydispersity were determined by GPC.73 The molecular weight was determined at 46 kDa with a PDI of 3.1.

Gel Trapping Sample Preparation
As a trapping matrix,
we chose PDMS gels, as they are optically transparent, are readily
swollen by many organic solvents, and can be prepared without free
radical approaches that could damage the semiconducting polymers.
We prepare our gel-trapped conjugated polymers as follows: we dissolve
conjugated polymers in toluene at 100 pM. We take 0.5 g of this solution,
and add 2.3 g of divinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (Gelest, Mw = 62.7 kDa), 0.2 g of a multifunctional cross-linker,
consisting of PDMS chains, carrying ∼8% of silicone hydride
functional groups (Gelest, Mw = 5.8 kDa),
and another 2 g of spectroscopy-grade toluene. This yields a final
conjugated polymer concentration of 10 pM. We thoroughly mix this
solution before adding a platinum catalyst (5 μL, Gelest). We
load this liquid precursor mixture into a glass sample chamber, with
a #1 coverslip top surface. We seal the sample chamber with PTFE grease
to prevent any solvent evaporation. We allow the gel to cure for 3
h, while we store the sample at room temperature in the dark.

Single-Molecule
Experiments
We perform various single-molecule
experiments to characterize different aspects of these molecules in
their solvated state, here described in short; for full details see
the SI. We collect full spectral information
at the single-molecule level using a home-built confocal microscope
(ThorLabs, excitation at 405 nm) equipped with a spectrograph (Andor
Kymera 193i) and CCD camera (Andor iDus 416). Single-molecule spectra
were deconvolved using serial Gaussian fitting (custom MatLab code,
available upon request). The spectra are obtained at a spectral resolution
of ∼1 nm, and the baseline was subtracted by taking the average
signal between 290 and 380 nm.

Single-molecule lifetime measurements
are performed on a Leica SP8 confocal, equipped with a FLIM module,
consisting of a pulsed, white-light laser source (excitation at 488
nm, 40 MHz pulse rate), equipped with a TCSPC module. Emission was
collected between 500 and 750 nm. These data are analyzed by digital
analysis of the FLIM data sets, using home-coded software. The centroid
positions of the diffraction-limited spots in the intensity image
were identified using established particle tracking algorithms implemented
in MatLab.74 We then use these centroids
to reconstruct the intensity decay traces for each single molecule
and subsequently fitted these to a multiexponential fitting model.
Photodynamics are measured on a Nikon C1 confocal (488 nm CW excitation).
We record an image area of 24 × 12 μm, with a 60×
oil immersion objective, at an aquisition rate of 12 images/second,
giving a time resolution of ∼80 ms. Also here we use automated
object identification to find diffraction-limited spots. We plot the
intensity within these spots, corrected for the dark counts on the
background, to obtain the intensity traces. Categorization of these
data is inspired by Tenopala-Carmona.43 Each trace is assigned to fall in one of two categories, either
following an exponential decrease or exhibiting strong intensity jumps
and thus deviations from the exponential decay. We fit each trace
to an exponential decay function and determine if the fit is good,
thus allowing classification into the first category. We use a Gaussian
mixture model75 to determine what class
each trace falls in, utilizing various parameters related to the goodness
of fit and the number of detected peaks in the raw intensity data.
Our Gaussian mixture model determines to what category each trace
belongs in this 7D space. This algorithm is available on request from
the authors (see SI for details).
