Liposomes, self-assembled
vesicles with a lipid-bilayer boundary
similar to cell membranes, are extensively used in both fundamental
and applied sciences. Manipulation of their physical properties, such
as growth and division, may significantly expand their use as model
systems in cellular and synthetic biology. Several approaches have
been explored to controllably divide liposomes, such as shape transformation
through temperature cycling, incorporation of additional lipids, and
the encapsulation of protein division machinery. However, so far,
these methods lacked control, exhibited low efficiency, and yielded
asymmetric division in terms of volume or lipid composition. Here,
we present a microfluidics-based strategy to realize mechanical division
of cell-sized (∼6 μm) liposomes. We use octanol-assisted
liposome assembly (OLA) to produce liposomes on chip, which are subsequently
flowed against the sharp edge of a wedge-shaped splitter. Upon encountering
such a Y-shaped bifurcation, the liposomes are deformed and, remarkably,
are able to divide into two stable daughter liposomes in just a few
milliseconds. The probability of successful division is found to critically
depend on the surface area-to-volume ratio of the mother liposome,
which can be tuned through osmotic pressure, and to strongly correlate
to the mother liposome size for given microchannel dimensions. The
division process is highly symmetric (∼3% size variation between
the daughter liposomes) and is accompanied by a low leakage. This
mechanical division of liposomes may constitute a valuable step to
establish a growth-division cycle of synthetic cells.

Cell division
is one of the
fundamental characteristics of living cells, responsible for the propagation
of all life. Although there is wide variety of biological division
mechanisms,1−3 a universal feature of division is the production
of one or more daughter cells from a mother cell, accompanied by the
transfer of the genetic material to the daughter cell(s). While cell
biology studies have contributed greatly to identify the complex protein
machinery and signaling cascades that orchestrate this crucial biological
process, in vitro reconstitution experiments are
increasingly used to clarify cause–effect relationships therein.
Multiple efforts have been initiated toward building bottom-up reconstituted
systems that can induce vesicle fission.4 Such an endeavor may significantly impact multiple scientific fields:
(i) Cell biology, as such research will expand our current understanding
of the cell-division machinery of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.
(ii) Origin of life, as protocells on the primitive earth were not
yet equipped with an evolved biological machinery, yet divided, likely
using some simple physical mechanism.5 Exploring
minimal ways of division will help to evaluate plausible modes of
life under prebiotic conditions on the early earth. (iii) Synthetic
biology, where novel forms of biotechnology are likely to emerge from
the pursuit of the ultimate challenge in bottom-up synthetic biology, viz., the de novo construction of a cell-like
entity that will autonomously undergo a continuous cycle of growth,
division, and evolution. Establishing efficient ways of synthetic
division will be a key step in realizing these goals.

Liposomes
are artificial vesicles whose membrane is composed of
a phospholipid bilayer, insulating their inner aqueous lumen from
the external aqueous environment. They are used in a range of applications
and have proven to be an excellent model system for bottom-up synthetic
biology6 because they exhibit the universal
feature of a lipid bilayer as the cell boundary and allow the encapsulation
of a variety of biomolecules in the lumen or within the bilayer itself.
Shape manipulation of liposomes to induce their fission has received
considerable interest over the years and has been explored using a
broad variety of physical, chemical, and biological strategies.4 First evidence that it was possible to induce
fission of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs, diameter >1 μm)
came from increasing their surface area-to-volume ratio by elevating
the temperature above the phase transition temperature of the lipids.7 Along similar lines, heating–cooling cycles
across the phase transition temperature were shown to induce inward/outward
budding and subsequent fission.8,9 Another route involved
forming coexisting lipid domains of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered
phases, and minimizing the line tension at the boundary to bring about
vesicle fission.10,11 Division can also be induced
by incorporating lipids or fatty acids into the liposomal membrane,12−15 or by providing surplus membrane to liposomes.16 A more biological approach can be undertaken by encapsulating
the minimal bacterial divisome machinery inside a liposome. Upon encapsulating
key bacterial proteins such as FtsZ and its membrane anchor FtsA,
constriction was reported in small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs, diameter
<100 nm),17 while division was observed
at a very low efficiency (<1%) in GUVs.18 Apart from these strategies, mechanical shearing, by extrusion of
vesicles through a membrane of defined pore size, is extensively used
for the preparation of monodispersed SUVs.19

All these strategies suffer from two key problems: (i) Lack
of
control: the division process in these methods is generally not very
predictable and has a low efficiency. (ii) Asymmetry: The division
is asymmetric in terms of volume, as the volume of the mother liposome
gets divided unequally over two or more daughter liposomes. It can
also be asymmetric in terms of the lipid composition, leading to an
unequal lipid composition of the daughter cells. Although asymmetric
division mechanisms have evolved in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes,2,3 achieving symmetric division is advantageous from the point of view
of equal distribution of the inner contents and thus the prospect
of a simple continuous growth-division synthetic cell cycle. From
our overview of results reported so far, we conclude that a method
for controlled, efficient, and symmetric division of cell-sized liposomes
is lacking.

In this paper, we report a different strategy to
achieve liposome
division where we use microfluidics to apply mechanical force to cut
liposomes in half. We use our recently developed microfluidic liposome-production
method, octanol-assisted liposome assembly (OLA), to generate cell-sized,
monodisperse, unilamellar liposomes inside microfluidic channels.20 We then collide these OLA-generated liposomes
against the edge of a wedge-shaped splitter at high velocity (a few
mm/s) (Figure 1). This
leads to pronounced shape deformations of liposomes that surprisingly
allow them to divide into two equal daughter liposomes under specific
conditions. We show that such division is possible only when the liposome
is tuned to have an excess surface area to compensate for the change
in surface area-to-volume ratio associated with the formation of two
smaller daughters compared to the original large mother liposome.
Also, the size of the liposomes, with respect to the microchannel
dimensions, is found to strongly influence their fate: liposomes which
are too small simply pass through one of the splitter branches of
the Y-junction, while too big liposomes undergo an overly severe deformation
and burst open. Only medium-sized liposomes are well set up to face
the deformation at the splitter and successfully divide into two daughter
liposomes. The division process is found to be highly symmetric (only
3% variation in the diameter of the daughter liposomes) and accompanied
by low leakage (∼10%). Our microfluidic splitter technique
thus provides a simple way to achieve symmetric, efficient, quick,
and protein-free division of cell-sized liposomes. Such a liposome
manipulation technique provides an excellent tool in bottom-up synthetic
biology, and it also can be utilized to achieve rapid production of
smaller liposomes through amplification.

liposomes. (a) Top-view schematic (not to

division of liposomes. Double-emulsion droplets are formed at the
production junction, which within minutes, mature into liposomes.
By maintaining a hypertonic environment, the liposomes lose a specific
volume, which sets up an intended high surface area-to-volume ratio.
These “floppy” liposomes then pass through a narrow
presplitter channel at a high velocity before they encounter the Y-shaped
splitter, whereupon they can divide into two daughter liposomes. (b–e)

upon encountering the splitter. (b) Division: A liposome gets deformed
at the splitter and divides into two daughter liposomes. Note the
similar size of the daughter liposomes indicating highly symmetric
division. Also, there is no obvious increase in the background intensity
after the splitting, indicating leakage-free division. (c) Bursting:
Mother liposome dissociates due to the membrane rupture, spilling
the inner contents into the environment. (d) Semi-division: Rarely,
only one of the daughter cells survives the division process, while
the other burst opens and dissociates. (e) Snaking: if small enough,
the liposome passes through one of the Y-branches of the splitter,
without either dividing or bursting. (f) Moving-frame region-of-interest
showing an entire division event including the entry of the liposome
into the narrow presplitter channel. The images underwent appropriate
background subtraction, and further analyses were performed with similarly
processed images. The lipid composition of liposomes is DOPC and Rh-PE
(molar ratio of 99.9:0.1). Time difference Δt between successive frames is Δtdivision = 1.2 ms (panel b), Δtbursting = 1.2 ms (panel c), Δtsemi-division = 3 ms (panel d), Δtsnaking =
4 ms (panel e), Δtmoving-frame = 2 ms (panel f). Horizontal arrows indicate the flow direction.
Mother liposomes appear deformed in the presplitter channel due to
motion blurring.

Results
We produced
unilamellar liposomes (4–10 μm in diameter)
using OLA.20 In a process akin to bubble-blowing,
OLA involves the formation of double-emulsion droplets (water droplets
encapsulated within a shell of lipids dissolved in 1-octanol, suspended
in an aqueous environment) at the production junction (Figure 1a), whereupon, within minutes,
these double-emulsion droplets spontaneously separate into liposomes
and 1-octanol droplets. This mixture of liposomes and 1-octanol droplets
steadily flows in the post-junction microfluidic channel with a velocity
set by the pressure exerted at the production junction. Simultaneously,
we decreased the volume of the liposomes by creating an osmotic pressure
difference across the membrane in order to make the division possible;
see details mentioned later in the text. At a sufficient distance
from the production junction, where most of the double-emulsion droplets
have given rise to liposomes, we bifurcated the microfluidic channel
into two smaller channels (each 4 μm wide, at an angle θ
= 70° with respect to each other), forming a Y-shaped junction,
termed “splitter” from now on (Figure 1a). Just before the splitter, the width of
the channel was narrowed to 8 μm, while the height of the channels
was about 7.5 μm for the entire device. For visualization, we
used high-speed fluorescence microscopy (up to 1000 frames per second),
and doped the liposomal bilayer membrane with a small fraction of
fluorescent lipids. At the same time, we also encapsulated a fluorescent
dye inside the liposomes (see Methods).

As a liposome entered the narrow pre-splitter channel, it encountered
the splitter with a collision velocity of 5–10 mm/s. Due to
its deformability, the liposome did not stall at the splitter, but
changed its shape, as it flowed past the junction. We categorized
the events that followed the encounter between the liposomes and the
splitter into four different types, viz., division,
bursting, semi-successful division, and snaking, which are described
as follows.

Division
In these events, the liposomes got stretched
symmetrically across the two branches of the splitter and subsequently
divided into two intact daughter liposomes (Figure 1b; Supplementary Movie S1 and Supplementary Movie S2).
The division time, defined as the time between the first contact of
the liposome with the splitter and its separation into two stable,
unconnected daughter liposomes, was very brief, amounting to only
a few milliseconds. The formed daughter liposomes were not deformed
but spherical in appearance, and flowed downstream of the splitter.
The sharp front edge of the splitter thus simply acted as a mechanical
cutter to bring about liposome division. Figure 1b shows an example of such a division event
where the fluorescence emitted from the lumen of the liposome was
recorded. Additionally, Figure 1f shows a processed moving-frame image sequence where an initially
spherical liposome enters the narrow pre-splitter channel and gets
cut at the splitter into two daughter liposomes. Further analyses
were performed on such processed image sequences (see Methods for details).

Bursting
Here,
the initial deformation of the liposome
over the two branches of the splitter looked similar to the division
event. By contrast, however, the deformed mother liposome ruptured
before daughter liposomes were able to form (Figure 1c, Supplementary Movie S3). As the membrane was disrupted, presumably due to a critically
increased surface tension, the inner contents of the liposome leaked
out and diffused into the environment.

Semi-division
In rare cases, only one daughter liposome
survived the splitting process, while the other one burst, resulting
in a semi-successful division process (Figure 1d, Supplementary Movie S4).

Snaking
In these events, the mother
liposome was not
observed to split into progeny but instead slipped as one entity through
one of the two splitter branches (Figure 1e, Supplementary Movie S5). This usually happened for small liposomes with a diameter
that was similar to the size of the Y-branches, as one would intuitively
expect.

Finally, we note that 1-octanol droplets and not-yet-separated
double-emulsion droplets (i.e., liposomes still connected
to an octanol droplet) also successfully split at the splitter (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Movie S6). Droplet division, however, is a fundamentally
different process, and has been reported before.21

Dividing a spherical mother liposome into two spherical
daughter
liposomes is challenged by the fundamental problem that both a constant
surface area (set by the amount of lipids in the mother liposome)
and conserved volume (in the absence of any leakage) must be maintained.
Yet, the surface area-to-volume ratio is different for two small spheres
compared to one large one, and hence it intrinsically will be different
before and after the splitting of a spherical liposome. As a consequence,
division is not possible without either a loss of volume or a gain
in the surface area. Some gain in surface area can be realized by
stretching the membrane, but only a limited expansion (∼5%)
can be realized.22,23 Potentially, one can increase
the surface area by inducing vesicle fusion,24 or by incorporation of external lipid molecules into the existing
lipid bilayer of the mother liposome.13,14 These are,
however, very difficult routes to implement near the splitter on a
millisecond time scale. Hence, we sought a simpler solution: reducing
the volume of the mother liposome. The volume of a liposome can in
fact be precisely tuned by inducing an appropriate osmotic pressure
difference across its semipermeable membrane. Thus, by decreasing
the volume of the mother liposome by extracting an appropriate amount
of water from it, it should be possible to create enough excess surface
area to fit the division requirement.

Concretely, for the symmetric
division of a mother liposome with
volume V0, area A0, and radius R0 into two smaller
liposomes each having radius r, the constraint of
area conservation, A0 = 4πR02 = 2 ×
4πr2 dictates that r = (R0/√2), i.e., the daughters have a radius that is (1/√2) ≈ 0.71
times that of the mother. Hence, the target volume V0 of the mother liposome must be reduced beforehand by
a factor α, which is deduced from the volume conservation in
the division, i.e., α(4/3)πR03 = 2 ×
(4/3)πr3 → α = (1/√2)
≈ 0.71. This simple analysis shows that we needed to decrease
the volume of mother liposomes beforehand from its perfect spherical
volume by 29%, using osmotic control. We experimentally tuned α
by using a hypertonic environment, having a surplus of sucrose compared
to the liposomal lumen, right from the start of the liposome production
([sucroselumen]/[sucroseenvironment] ≈
0.7 → α ≈ 0.7) (Figure 1). Unintended rupture of some double-emulsion
droplets and liposomes reduced the external sucrose concentration
slightly, yielding an actual value of α that we estimated to
be around 0.76 (see Supplementary Note S1). Nonetheless, as previously discussed, liposomes can tolerate a
limited area expansion, providing enough margin for the division to
take place. Deliberately decreasing the value of α to 0.65,
in order to compensate for the experimental rise, did not lead to
a more efficient liposome production and thus was not pursued further.
On the basis of a previously developed permeability model,25 the time needed for the liposome to reach osmotic
equilibrium with its environment was estimated to be less than 20
s (Supplementary Note S2, Supplementary Figure S2). Since it took more than 2 min for
the liposome to reach the splitting geometry in the experiments, it
can be safely assumed that the liposomes reached osmotic equilibrium
before hitting the splitter, allowing the volume to be decreased appropriately.
As expected, when we instead bombarded the liposomes against the splitter
under isotonic conditions (without any osmotic pressure difference, i.e., no sucrose gradient across the membrane), liposome
division was never observed. Instead, bursting or snaking events were
obtained over the whole size range of mother liposomes (Supplementary Figure S3).

We quantitatively
analyzed the four distinct types of events, to
check the frequency of occurrence, the symmetry, and the leakage involved
in the splitting process. Figure 2a shows a plot of the mean diameter of daughter liposomes
against that of the corresponding mother liposomes (see Methods for diameter estimation). For division events, a strong
linear correlation was obtained between the two (R2 = 0.89), with the diameter of the daughter liposomes
being about 0.74 times that of their corresponding mother liposomes
(slope m = 0.74 ± 0.01; mean ± standard
deviation, s.d.). This value is close to what one would expect for
a symmetric division. In order to investigate the correlation between
liposome size and its fate at the splitter, we plotted the probability
of different events as a function of the mother liposome diameter
(Figure 2c–f).
The frequency histograms of the corresponding size distributions for
the different events is given in Supplementary Figure S4. As can be seen in Figure 2c, the probability of a successful division
(pdivision) follows a bell-shaped curve,
with a peak value at about 6 μm. For lower (<5 μm)
as well as higher diameters (>7 μm), pdivision rapidly decreases to zero. Snaking events are prominent
for the smallest liposomes, dmother =
4–6 μm (Figure 2f). On the other hand, the probability of bursting (pbursting) increases sharply with size, becoming
the majority event for dmother ≥
7 μm (Figure 2d). Semi-divisions, which are very rare events, occur exclusively
for dmother ≥ 7 μm (Figure 2e).

Figure 2 Liposome fate upon encountering
the splitter is determined by its
size. (a) Mean diameter of daughter liposomes against that of corresponding
mother liposomes. Red circles represent division events, while cyan
squares represent semi-divisions. The line shows a linear fit with
a slope m = 0.74 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.d., R2 = 0.89). For bursts (dark blue diamonds),
data points are displayed at the horizontal axis, since no daughter
liposomes were formed. Horizontal and vertical error bars indicate
corresponding standard deviations. Ndivision = 151, Nburst = 602, Nsemi-division = 46. (b) Top-view schematics explaining
how liposome size affects the splitting probability. A small enough
liposome is moderately stretched at the splitter but still has enough
excess surface area required for division. For a bigger liposome,
the decrease in excess surface area is more drastic, thus increasing
the probability of bursting. (c–f) The probability of different
events, viz., division (c), bursting (d), semi-division
(e), and snaking (f) as a function of liposome diameter, obtained
from the experimental data (Ndivision =
151, Nburst = 602, Nsemi-division = 46, Nsnake = 159). The value of each bar denotes the fraction of the specific
event occurring for that particular liposome diameter. Channel dimensions
were kept constant, and the impact velocity varied within a similar
range for all the events.

Such a distinct probability distribution for different events
clearly
demonstrates the role of liposome size relative to the dimensions
of the microchannels in which it is confined, in determining the liposome
fate as it collides with the splitter. If the value of liposome diameter
is similar to the width of the Y-branches, it can simply squeeze through
one of the branches without getting obstructed at the splitter. On
the other hand, a bigger liposome gets symmetrically stretched out
across both channels of the splitter (Figure 2b) and can potentially split into two daughter
liposomes. We expect the division to occur only if the liposome has
enough excess surface area to compensate for the surface area increase
due to the stretching at the splitter. Indeed, when a middle-sized
liposome (e.g., 6 μm in diameter) gets stretched
across the splitter, its surface area increases marginally (∼7%,
see Methods for details), and the liposome
is still able to divide since the stretching is much less that the
excess surface area (∼27%) induced by the osmotically regulated
volume reduction. In case of a larger liposome (e.g., 8 μm in diameter), however, the increase in the surface area
is more drastic (∼28%) as the liposomes is stretched across
the splitter. This makes the division less likely, as the membrane
ruptures and the liposome bursts (Figure 2b). Thus, the upper limit on the size of
the mother liposome for a successful division is a result of a compromise
between allowing for enough deformation of the mother liposome and
not putting it under too much mechanical stress. We also checked whether
different fates of liposomes correlated with the collision velocity,
but no such correlation was found within the narrow range of collision
velocities with which the liposomes hit the splitter (between 5 to
10 mm/s; Supplementary Figure S5). Lastly,
the splitter angle did not seem to be of much significance for the
mechanical division of liposomes, as a substantial change in its value
(θ = 30°) also led to liposome division and comparable
probability distributions for different events (Supplementary Figure S6).

Next, we quantified the symmetry
involved in the division process, i.e., how similar
the daughter liposomes are in terms of
their size and the encapsulated material. Figure 3a shows the diameters of the daughter liposomes
plotted against each other, for each daughter pair from the same mother
liposome. A slope of 0.99 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.d.; R2 = 0.88) indicates that the physical splitting of the
liposomes is highly symmetric, on average leading to two daughter
liposomes of the same size. In order to quantify the size variation
between daughter liposomes, we define a (conservatively chosen) symmetry
parameter as s = (dsmall/dbig), where dsmall is the diameter of the smaller daughter liposome and dbig is that of the bigger daughter liposome.
From our data, we calculated s = 0.97 ± 0.03
(mean ± s.d.), reflecting, on average, a mere 3% coefficient
of variation in the size of the two daughter liposomes. Figure 3b shows the correlation between
the total fluorescence counts from the two daughter liposomes. Again,
a slope of 0.97 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.d.; R2 = 0.86) indicates that the daughter liposomes have a nearly
identical concentration of dye molecules encapsulated within their
lumen.

Figure 3 Mechanical division of liposomes is highly symmetric. (a) Plot
showing the correlation between the diameters of the daughter liposomes,
resulting from the same mother liposome. The linear fit, shown by
the line, has a slope of 0.99 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.d., R2 = 0.88), emphasizing the highly symmetric
nature of the division process. (b) Plot showing the correlation obtained
between the total intensity of the two daughter liposomes obtained
from the same mother liposome. The solid line, which is a linear fit
to the data set, has a slope of m = 0.97 ± 0.01
(mean ± s.d., R2 = 0.86), indicating
an equal distribution of the encapsulated material during the division
process. Horizontal and vertical error bars indicate corresponding
standard deviations. In total, 152 (panel a) and 151 (panel b) pairs
of daughter liposomes were analyzed.

An important aspect of the splitting process is the leakage
involved, i.e., to what extent the encapsulated molecules
in the mother
vesicle are transferred to the two daughter liposomes. For both natural
and synthetic cells, it is important that division occurs in as leakage-free
manner as possible, to avoid the loss of vital cellular components.
A straightforward way to calculate the leakage is to compare the fluorescence
intensity of the mother to that of the two daughter liposomes combined,
where the difference indicates the leakage involved. Figure 4a shows the total fluorescence
intensity counts of both daughter liposomes combined, against the
total intensity of the corresponding mother liposomes. We obtained
a robust linear correlation (R2 = 0.94),
with a slope m = 0.87 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.d.),
suggesting a leakage of 13%. Note that this value remained unchanged
after using a correction factor, i.e., coincidentally
the correction factor equaled 1 (viz., effectively
no correction). The correction factor accounted for two opposing effects,
namely a background correction that amended for the dependence of
obtained fluorescence counts on channel geometry, and an optical correction
that amended for the dependence of obtained fluorescence counts on
object size (see Methods). Summing up, we
estimated a low leakage during the division process, on the order
of 10%.

Figure 4 Liposome division is associated with a low leakage. (a) Plot of
the total intensity of daughter liposomes against that of the corresponding
mother liposomes (N = 78). The intensities are strongly
correlated, with the solid line showing a linear fit with a slope
of m = 0.87 ± 0.01 (mean ± s.d., R2 = 0.94), suggesting a leakage of 13% during
the division process. Horizontal and vertical error bars indicate
corresponding standard deviations. (b) Top-view schematic showing
a dividing liposome at different time points. Summing up the fluorescence
intensity along the x- (or y) axis
for each region-of-interest generates a moving-frame x–t (or y–t) kymograph. (c) Average x–t kymographs for division (upper, N = 131)
and bursting (lower, N = 199) events. The x–t kymograph of dividing liposomes
gives a straight bright trace, while that of bursting liposomes results
in a rapidly fading trace. (d) Average intensity profile stays constant
in case of division (red solid line), while decays rapidly in case
of bursting (blue dashed line). The plots are obtained from the corresponding
average moving-frame x–t kymographs.
The shaded regions indicate the standard deviations. (e–f)
Average moving-frame y–t kymograph
of division events (e) which clearly shows a constant dark background
confirming a very low amount of leakage involved in the division process
(N = 131). In comparison, a similar kymograph for
bursting events (f) shows a considerable rise in the background as
the encapsulated dye diffuses away into the environment (N = 199). The vertical dashed lines in b, c, e and f indicate the
splitter position. Contrast has been enhanced for better visualization.

To further corroborate the low
leakage involved in the division
process, we quantified the increase in the background intensity in
the external environment, just after the division took place. First,
we built moving-frame movies of individual liposomes by cutting a
region-of-interest around the liposome for each time point (t1, t2, ...), as
indicated in Figure 4b. Using these movies, we built kymographs by summing up the fluorescence
intensity of each movie frame, along either the x- or the y-axis. By summing up the intensity along
the x-axis, i.e., parallel to the
pre-splitter channel, we obtained average x–t kymographs for division as well as bursting events (Figure 4c). Plotting the
intensity profile across the x–t kymograph for division events showed a nearly constant fluorescence
intensity for the liposomes (Figure 4d, solid red line), confirming low leakage. By contrast,
the bursting events show a rapid decay (Figure 4d, dashed blue line). By summing up the intensity
along the y-axis, i.e., perpendicular
to the pre-splitter channel, we obtained average y–t kymographs for division (Figure 4e) and bursting events (Figure 4f). A y–t kymograph of a dividing liposome generated
a horizontal line that bifurcated after the splitter, while the y–t kymograph of a bursting liposome
produced a straight line until the splitter position, after which
it fades due to the diffusion of the leaked fluorescent molecules.
As can be clearly observed, there is no appreciable change in the
background intensity for the division kymographs, while in case of
bursting kymographs, the dissociation of liposome is evident from
the diffusion of the fluorescent dye into the environment. In order
to check whether the divided liposomes were stable over long periods
of time, we obtained images of divided and snaked liposomes after
a substantial time interval (>1 h) after the division (see Supplementary Figure S7). These images clearly
show that encapsulated fluorescent molecules did not leak out from
the liposomes and no long-lasting pores were formed during or after
the division process. High-resolution images that visualize the liposome
membrane clearly showed the intact nature of the membrane. Overall,
we conclude that the mechanically induced division of liposomes is
accompanied by a low leakage.

Conclusions
In
this paper, we have described an efficient and simple method
to divide cell-sized (∼6 μm) liposomes in a highly symmetric
and a low-leakage manner. By flowing the liposomes onto a Y-shaped
junction at high flow velocity, we could efficiently divide them into
two daughter liposomes, with a low leakage (∼10% of the volume)
and excellent symmetry (∼3% variation in the diameter). This
division was facilitated by inducing an osmotic pressure difference
across the membrane of the mother liposome, in order to reduce its
volume by about 30% before the division, so as to account for the
different surface area-to-volume ratio of the daughter vesicles as
compared to the mother vesicle. In absence of such a controlled volume
reduction, we did not observe divisions but only bursting and snaking
of liposomes.

How does the division occur exactly? There are
two distinct possibilities
for the mechanism that underlies the mechanical liposome division
that is observed. Splitting may occur through a hemifission mechanism:
As the liposome gets strongly deformed at the Y-junction, it is pushed
sideways to both splitter channels, and the two bilayers at the front
and back end of the deformed liposome are forced to approach and perhaps
even touch each other at the tip of the splitter. This direct contact
may lead to a hemifission process, changing the topology of the connecting
bilayers. This would constitute a splitting process with a high chance
for a completely leakage-free fission. Notably, protein-free hemifusion
(which is the opposite of hemifission) has been experimentally verified
and shown to be dependent on sufficiently close interbilayer contact.26 Alternatively, however, division may occur through
a break-seal mechanism. In this scenario, the liposome flows against
the Y-junction, and gets strongly deformed. As it continues to get
stretched, the lipid bilayer breaks, most likely on the posterior
sides where the local stress is most pronounced, and two daughter
liposomes are formed that each have a transient open pore. These pores
subsequently reseal and give rise to intact daughter liposomes. It
has been experimentally observed that increasing the membrane tension
of a liposome can indeed result in a transient pore that reseals itself
if sufficient inner content leaks out to release the tension.27 Unfortunately, the imaging resolution does not
allow to rigorously distinguish by what mechanism the liposomes undergo
physical division. The small but finite leakage observed in our experiments
suggests that the break-seal division mode underlies the splitting
process.

Mechanical division of liposomes can be advantageous
for several
applications. Similar to the system developed for single- and double-emulsion
amplification through division,21 mechanical
liposome division could, in principle, be used to exponentially amplify
the number of liposomes. Since the volume of daughter liposomes halves
at every division, the methodology presented here suggests a way to
cover a broader size range, and potentially form submicrometer-sized
liposomes. This may open up the possibility of using OLA-based liposomes
as drug delivery systems, since optimal drug carriers are in the submicrometer
range.29 It could also be effective to
place the splitter right after the production junction, in order to
first divide the double-emulsion droplets (which is an efficient and
robust process as can be seen from Supplementary Movie S6) and then let the liposomes mature upon subsequent
separation of 1-octanol droplets. As with any technique, the mechanical
division approach also has its limitations. For example, this approach
might prove difficult to apply to multicomponent vesicles. Also, the
liposomes may contain trace amount of 1-octanol present in the membrane.

One of the foreseeable aims in synthetic biology is to establish
a primitive life cycle of vesicles that grow and divide in a recurring
manner. In order to obtain such a cycle, the symmetric nature of the
division (both in terms of volume and lipid composition) is advantageous.
Furthermore, the division should be as leakage-free as possible, since
loss of low-copy-number information-carrying molecules like ribonucleic
acids may render daughter cells unviable. The presented scheme for
mechanical division of liposomes makes highly symmetric liposomes
that are capable of potentially undergoing repeated division cycles,
when combined with a growth module. The presented strategy of using
a mechanical force to induce shape manipulations and achieve protein-free
division may also have implications in the origin-of-life research.
In absence of complex biological machinery, protocells on early earth
likely relied on physical shear forces, such as fluid currents and
migration through narrow solid confinements (e.g., in clay), in order to produce offspring. As has been shown before
for the case of fatty acid vesicles,30−32 we show here that a
purely mechanical division of lipid-based vesicles is also indeed
possible, providing support for such a mode of protocell division.

Future research may expand in many directions. For example, by
creating asymmetric splitting junctions, one can investigate how the
symmetry of division is affected by the symmetry of the splitter.
Simulations, along with ultrahigh-spatiotemporal-resolution images
of the division process, could shed further light on the details of
the division process, possibly distinguishing between the proposed
hemifission and the break-seal mechanisms. As lipid composition is
known to play a crucial role in membrane fusion and fission,26 it will be interesting to see the effect of
different membrane compositions on the splitting efficiency. So far,
it was not possible to significantly modulate the flow velocity, since
the splitter is directly connected to the production junction. Using
a recently developed density-based liposome separation technique which
decouples the production and further downstream experimentation,33 it will be possible to vary the collision velocity
of the liposomes, and investigate its effect on the splitting efficiency.
Finally, combining the physical division with a growth module to achieve
a growth-division cycle will be a significant step in the context
of synthetic biology.

Methods
Liposome Production
Using OLA
Please refer to our online
protocol for further details and troubleshooting of OLA.34

LO (Lipid-Containing 1-Octanol) Phase Preparation
Lipids,
dissolved in chloroform, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.
Chloroform was evaporated by passing a gentle stream of argon or nitrogen,
and the lipids were further dried by desiccating for at least 2 h.
A stock concentration (100 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving the lipids
in ethanol and stored at −20 °C under inert gas atmosphere.
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) was
used as the lipid source. A fluorescent lipid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine
rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Rh-PE) was added for visualization (DOPC:Rh-PE
= 99.9:0.1, molar ratio). During experiments, the stock solution was
dissolved in 1-octanol (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) to a final concentration
of 2 mg/mL.

Soft Lithography
Patterns were fabricated
in silicon,
using e-beam lithography and dry etching procedure, as described elsewhere.20 Additionally, after etching, the wafer was cleaned
in the inductive coupled plasma (ICP) reactive-ion etcher (Adixen
AMS 100 I-speeder) at a pressure of 0.04 mbar, ICP power set at 2500
W with a biased power of 60 W, a source-target distance of 200 mm,
temperature set at 10 °C, and using O2 gas at 200
sccm for 3–5 min. The height of the etched-structures was measured
using a stylus profiler, DektakXT (Bruker Corporation) and was 7.5
μm. Finally, the wafer was cleaned with acetone, rinsed in deionized
water and spin-dried. The wafer surface was then rendered antiadhesive
by exposing it to (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl) trichlorosilane
(abcr GmbH & Co.) in partial vacuum for at least 12 h.

Microfluidic
devices were made by pouring polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), mixed with
a curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning GmbH) at a mass ratio 10:1,
on the wafer and baking at 80 °C for at least 4 h. The PDMS block
was then peeled off from the wafer and holes were punched into it
using a biopsy punch (World Precision Instruments, inner diameter
0.77 mm). The PDMS block was then cleaned with isopropanol and dried
under a stream of nitrogen. Glass slides were also coated with a thin
PDMS layer as described previously.20 The
PDMS block and the PDMS-coated glass slide were then exposed to oxygen
plasma for ∼10 s (3–4 SCFH O2, 200 W) using
a Plasma-Preen system (Plasmatic Systems, Inc.). Immediately after
the plasma treatment, the glass slide was bonded to the PDMS block.
The device was further baked at 80 °C for ∼20 min. Microfluidic
flow control system (positive pressure: 0–1000 mbar, Fluigent
GmbH) along with the MAESFLO software (version 3.2.1) were used to
flow the solutions into the microfluidic device using appropriate
metal connectors (BD microlance needles, outer diameter 0.6 mm, cut
into ∼1 cm pieces) and tubing (Tygon Microbore Tubing, inner
diameter 0.51 mm).

Surface Treatment and Experimentation
Channels downstream
of the liposome-producing junction were rendered hydrophilic by adsorbing
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) polymers (Sigma-Aldrich) to the PDMS surface,
as described elsewhere.20

Image Acquisition
and Processing
An Olympus IX81 inverted
microscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination, appropriate
filter sets, a 20× (UPlanSApo, numerical aperture 0.75) objective
(Olympus), and a 60× (PlanApoN, numerical aperture 1.45, oil)
objective (Olympus) were used to perform the experiments. The images
were recorded using a Neo sCMOS camera or a Zyla 4.2 PLUS CMOS camera
(Andor Technology), and a micromanager software (version 1.4.14).35

In the recorded movies, liposomes appeared
as bright objects while 1-octanol droplets/pockets appeared as dark
objects. The background was faintly fluorescent, due to unintended
rupturing events upstream of the splitter and/or due to the low concentration
of fluorescent molecules present in the environment (Supplementary Movie S2). The background fluorescence helped
to rule out the false-positive division events, where a 1-octanol
pocket was still attached to the liposome as it encountered the splitter.
Image processing was performed with MATLAB, using self-written scripts
(see Supplementary Figure S8 for a typical
example). Briefly, high-speed movies capturing the fluorescence from
the encapsulated dye were used to track bright objects in the successive
movie frames, using a particle detection-and-tracing routine. The
resulting position-time traces were classified depending on the nature
of the events (division, burst, semi-division, snake), while the difference
between traces yielded local velocities. Screening was done to remove
erroneous traces (e.g., two different mother liposomes
detected within a single position-time trace). This was done by plotting
the ratio of the major and the minor axis of the daughter liposomes
(Amaj/Amin), against the intensity ratio of daughter and mother liposomes (Idaughter/Imother). This led to event-specific clusters; data points lying beyond
two standard deviations (±2σ) from the mean value of that
particular event (μ) were removed. Only the first frames, before
the liposome entered the narrow pre-splitter channel, were used for
the measurement of total fluorescence counts, area, major axis, and
minor axis. In this way, any effects of motion-blurring and physical
deformation at the junction were avoided. The contribution of the
background dye to the fluorescence of the liposome was minimized by
subtracting the movie median from each movie image. Further data processing
was performed on regions-of-interest (ROIs) around the object cut
from the movie frames. For each ROI, a second background subtraction
was performed using the lowest value detected inside the microfluidic
channel.

Each data point is plotted as an average, its value
obtained from
several consecutive ROIs. Fluorescent intensity of liposomes was obtained
by summing up all the counts above 10% of the peak value, to avoid
inclusion of random background fluctuations. For measurements of area,
major axis, and minor axis, a binary image of the fluorescent signal
was used, with the threshold set at the half-maximum value. Diameter,
either for free liposomes or when the liposome was squeezed into a
disc-like shape inside the microfluidic channel, was calculated from
the area as described elsewhere.20 To estimate
the increase in the surface area of the mother liposome as it got
stretched at the splitter, the liposome was approximated as an ellipsoid,
with one principal semi-axis, a = 2 μm (Y-branch
width/2) and the second semi-axis, b = 3.75 μm
(channel height/2). The third semi-axis c was calculated
as (3V/4πab), where V is the liposome volume that was calculated by considering
the liposome as a non-stretched sphere of the mentioned diameter.
The surface area was then approximated as 4π((ab1.6 + ac1.6 + bc1.6)/3)(1/1.6).

Estimation of the Correction
Factor for Comparing Mother and
Daughter Liposome Intensities
We found that, even after a
straightforward background subtraction, the resulting fluorescence
counts were still sensitive to the location where the object was analyzed,
whether it was in the pre-splitter part or the wider post-splitter
part of the channel. To compensate for this intensity difference due
to the channel geometry, a background correction factor (c1) was introduced using snaking events as a reference.
During snaking, liposomes simply flowed across the splitter through
one of the Y-branches, and thus were safely assumed to be leakage-free
events. Plotting the intensities of snaking liposomes before and after
the splitter gave the value of c1 = 0.90
(Supplementary Figure S7).

Furthermore,
in order to account for the influence of the object size on the obtained
fluorescence counts, an additional optical correction factor (c2) was introduced. To quantify this dependence
for a leakage-free system, we analyzed the division of 4–8
μm 1-octanol droplets (Supplementary Figure S10). These droplets, being single-emulsions, undergo a completely
leakage-free division at the splitter. A clear linear relationship
between the total fluorescence counts of the two daughter droplets
against the corresponding mother droplets was obtained, yielding c2 = 1.11 (Supplementary Figure S10b). The total correction factor was thus calculated
as c = c1c2 = 1.00.

Solution Compositions
All the solutions
were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, except Dextran-Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Weight
10 000) which was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
OLA requires the presence of Poloxamer 188 (P188), a nonionic triblock
copolymer surfactant, which weakly adsorbs on the membrane surface.36 Since P188 does not insert itself into the membrane,
it is highly unlikely that its presence is crucial for a successful
liposome division.

Inner aqueous phase consisted of 15% v/v
glycerol, 5% w/v P188, fluorescent molecules (either 98 μM Alexa
Fluor 350 or 16 μM Dextran-Alexa Fluor 647), and sucrose (58
mM or 70 mM), dissolved in pure water. Lipid-carrying organic phase
was 0.2% w/v lipids (99.9 mol % DOPC + 0.1 mol % Rh-PE) in 1-octanol.
Outer aqueous phase was made up of 15% v/v glycerol, 5% w/v P188,
optional fluorescent molecules (4 μM Dextran-Alexa Fluor 647),
and sucrose (82 mM or 100 mM), dissolved in pure water. Sucrose concentrations
in the two aqueous phases were chosen so that α = 0.7. In case
of negative control, no sucrose or 100 mM sucrose was present in both
the inner and the outer aqueous phase.
