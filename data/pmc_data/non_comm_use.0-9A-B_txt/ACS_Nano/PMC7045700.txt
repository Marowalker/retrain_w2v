We
describe a successful strategy to substantially enhance cell
nucleation efficiency in polymer foams by using designer nanoparticles
as nucleating agents. Bare and poly(dimethylsilane) (PDMS)-grafted
raspberry-like silica nanoparticles with diameters ranging from ∼80
nm to ∼200 nm were synthesized and utilized as highly efficient
cell nucleators in CO2-blown nanocellular polymethyl methacrylate
(PMMA) foams. The successful synthesis of core–shell nanoparticles
was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements, and transmission
electron microscopy. The cell size and cell density of the obtained
PMMA micro- and nanocellular foams were determined by scanning electron
microscopy. The results show that increased surface roughness enhances
the nucleation efficiency of the designer silica particles. This effect
is ascribed to a decreased nucleation free energy for foam cell nucleation
in the nanocavities at the melt–nucleator interface. For PDMS
grafted raspberry-like silica nanoparticles with diameters of 155
and 200 nm, multiple cell nucleation events were observed. These hybrid
particles had nucleation efficiencies of 3.7 and 6.2, respectively.
The surprising increase in nucleation efficiency to above unity is
ascribed to the significant increase in CO2 absorption
and capillary condensation in the corresponding PMMA during saturation.
This increase results in the presence of large amounts of the physical
blowing agent close to energetically favorable nucleation points.
Additionally, it is shown that as a consequence of cell coalescence,
the increased number of foam cells is rapidly reduced during the first
seconds of foaming. Hence, the design of highly efficient nucleating
particles, as well as careful selection of foam matrix materials,
seems to be of pivotal importance for obtaining polymer cellular materials
with cell dimensions at the nanoscale. These findings contribute to
the fabrication of polymer foams with high thermal insulation capacity
and have relevance in general to the area of cellular materials.

==== Body
Nanocellular
polymer foams are
receiving considerable attention from the scientific and industrial
communities.1−6 This interest is ascribed to the unexpected and sometimes exciting
foam properties when their cells have diameters on the order of a
few tens to hundreds of nanometers. For instance, the thermal conductivity
of nanocellular foams is significantly reduced as a result of the
Knudsen effect provided that the foam density is sufficiently low.2,7 In addition, compared to that of microcellular foams with similar
densities, the mechanical performance of these foams in terms of,
for example, the Young’s modulus, impact properties and Shore
hardness, is significantly improved.8−10 Thus, nanocellular polymer
foams with low thermal conductivity can offer great alternative options
when considering new classes of materials, for instance, to realize
reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in transportation
as well as to manage the thermal energy in buildings.

Nanocellular
polymer foam structures can be obtained by various
strategies, for example, selective extraction/decomposition,11,12 templating/imprinting,13−15 chemical/physical foaming,8,16−20etc. Among these methods, CO2-based
batch foaming is of particular interest, which is ascribed to good
control over the foaming conditions as well as to the low cost and
environmental friendliness of CO2 as a physical blowing
agent.9 In batch foaming, the polymer is
first saturated with CO2 at a few to several hundreds of
bars for a given time (on the order of hours to days). Subsequently,
foaming is induced by a quick depressurization step that is typically
followed by an increase in temperature. This results in an oversaturation
of the dissolved CO2 in the polymer gas mixture leading
to cell nucleation followed by rapid cell expansion.21 The disadvantage of batch foaming compared to other methods
is that it has a relatively small batch size (i.e., on the scale of liters), which limits the industrial
relevance of this process. On the other hand, nanocellular foam extrusion,
that is, a continuous process, remains challenging, which is ascribed
to the difficult control over key physical foaming parameters, for
example, CO2 solubility, CO2 diffusivity, and
foaming temperature.22−24

In addition to the production challenges, nanocellular
foams with
high porosities (>85%) and cell densities (>1014 cells
cm–3) have been rarely reported.4,25−27 This is ascribed to the fact that it is difficult
to nucleate such high cell densities in the early stages of foaming.
In addition, on the time scale of foaming, cell coalesce is hard to
avoid. Frequently used strategies to increase the nucleated cell density
rely on increasing the physical blowing agent saturation pressure
and/or increasing the pressure release rate.3,25,28

The introduction of nanostructured
heterogeneous phases to polymers
as heterogeneous nucleation sites prior to foaming has also been considered
a promising approach. Examples include the use of phase-separated
block copolymer domains29−32 and inorganic nanofillers.18,33−38

For instance, Rodríguez-Pérez and co-workers29 reported on CO2-assisted batch foaming
of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly(methyl methacrylate-block-butyl acrylate-block methyl methacrylate)
(MAM) blends. The authors demonstrated that foam cells produced from
these PMMA/MAM blends were nucleated in the nanostructured MAM micellar
phase, which is ascribed to the high CO2-philicity of the
poly(butyl acrylate) phase compared to the PMMA matrix. McClurg and
co-workers31 demonstrated that the incorporation
of A-B diblock copolymers containing poly(dimethylsiloxane) as the
core block into polystyrene prior to foaming increases the cell density
of microcellular polystyrene foams. The nanostructured poly(dimethylsilane)
(PDMS) domains were considered efficient nucleation sites because
of their high CO2-philicity as well as the low surface
energy of PDMS.

Compared to block copolymer micelles, silica
nanoparticles are
of particular interest for use as heterogeneous nucleation agents
in polymer foaming because of their low cost and easy preparation
and the simplicity of employing various surface decoration strategies.39,40 For instance, Zhai and co-workers37 demonstrated
that the incorporation of silica nanoparticles into polycarbonate
prior to foaming resulted in a higher cell density and more uniform
cell size distribution than those in the polycarbonate foams containing
no silica nanoparticles as nucleating agents. Yang and co-workers41 reported that the decoration of silica nanoparticles
with CO2-philic poly(ionic liquid) significantly enhances
cell nucleation in CO2-assisted polystyrene foaming compared
to polystyrene foams prepared with bare silica nanoparticles as nucleating
agents. Despite these promising results, we note that the nanoparticles
utilized so far for nucleation have suffered from poor nucleation
efficiencies; that is, the number of foam cells obtained per number
of nanoparticles per cm3 added to the polymer matrix prior
to foaming was small. The nucleation efficiencies for these inorganic
particle-based nanofillers are typically far below 0.01.18,41−43 This means that hundreds of added particles result
in the formation of only one foam cell during foaming. In these calculations,
it is assumed that homogeneous nucleation and cell coalescence can
be neglected.3 We have reported the successful
utilization of PDMS-grafted silica nanoparticles with a silica core
diameter of 80 nm with a nucleation efficiency of approximately 0.5
for the preparation of CO2-blown batch PMMA foams.33 The good efficiency of these particles is ascribed
to (i) the low surface energy of the PDMS shell, which reduces the
nucleation energy barrier and (ii) the higher local CO2 concentration in the PDMS shell (∼75 wt %)44 than in the PMMA matrix (∼18 wt %).45 Furthermore, we demonstrated that the contribution of line
tension significantly reduces the nucleation efficiency of PDMS-grafted
nanoparticles with a silica core diameter below 40 nm under the used
foaming conditions (i.e., CO2 saturation pressure of 55 bar and foaming at 40 °C).33 Thus, the use of smaller particles, for example,
particles 10 nm in diameter, is considered unfavorable, although it
would in principle allow for the addition of the required high number
of potential nucleation sites (>1015 cm–3) at relatively low weight percentages of particle loading. In fact,
increasing the weight percentage of particle loading for particles
with sufficiently large diameters (>60 nm) to incorporate the required
number of potential nucleation sites renders the resulting particle-filled
polymer matrix barely foamable. Thus, we conclude that enhanced particle
designs are needed to increase the nucleation efficiency to unity
and beyond.

The effect of surface roughness (e.g., nanocavities) on the free energy of heterogeneous
foam cell nucleation
has not been included in the particle design process until now. Yang
and co-workers reported46 a thermodynamic
model and an analytical solution for the free energy of cell nucleation
at the nanometer length scale in nanocavities. They showed that cells
nucleated from a concave surface have a lower nucleation free energy
than cells nucleated from flat convex surfaces (e.g., spherical particles).47,48 Inspired by these results, we considered surface roughness as an
important and ignored design parameter for hybrid nucleating particle
designs in enhanced nanocellular foaming. We chose a strategy to prepare
silica nanoparticles with a superimposed roughened surface morphology.
As the particles resemble a raspberry in appearance, we call them
raspberry-like silica nanoparticles.

Since the preparation of
raspberry-like silica nanoparticles is
fairly easy and well described in the literature,49−53 we considered these surface roughened nanoparticles
as ideal candidates to explore the effect of nanocavities on cell
nucleation of nanocellular foams. For example, He and co-workers51 reported on a method to produce raspberry-like
nanoparticles by a self-templated etching route. This method limits
the particle diameter to 60 nm or larger. In fact, for the purpose
of this work, this size is acceptable since it allowed us to study
the effect of particle surface roughness on foam cell nucleation without
considering other effects, such as particle curvature.43,54

Here, we show that raspberry-like silica nanoparticles are
efficient
foam cell nucleators with nucleation efficiencies that are comparable
to their PDMS grafted nearly spherical counterparts. Upon decorating
the raspberry-like silica nanoparticles with a few nanometer-thick
PDMS shell, multiple foam cell nucleation events were observed from
a single designer nanoparticle, and the highest nucleation efficiency
obtained was 6.2 for particles with an overall core diameter of ∼200
nm. This nucleation efficiency is nearly 40 times higher than that
of a pristine nearly spherical silica nanoparticle with a similar
diameter. We qualitatively show that the high nucleation efficiency
obtained for PDMS-grafted raspberry-like silica nanoparticles is ascribed
to a significantly increased absorption of CO2 during saturation.
This process results in an increased CO2 concentration
close to the PDMS-decorated, energetically favorable nanocavities
at the nucleating surface. The utilization of surface cavities combined
with optimized surface chemistry for efficient heterogeneous nucleation
at the macromolecular length scale is of interest for the production
of nanocellular foams with high cell densities and thus superior thermal
insulation power.

Results and Discussion
Core-Shell Raspberry-like
Nanoparticle Synthesis and Characterization
Raspberry-like
silica nanoparticles (SiO2-R) were synthesized
by the reaction of Stöber silica nanoparticles with NaBH4, followed by the surface grafting of PDMS to yield rough
silica core PDMS-shell hybrid nanoparticles (SiO2-RP).
The reaction scheme is depicted in Figure 1a. (Hereinafter we abbreviate “nanoparticle”
with NP.) During the reaction of nearly smooth Stöber SiO2 (SiO2-S) NPs with NaBH4, the high basicity
of the dissolved NaBH4 results in the dissociation of Si–O
bonds and subsequently in the formation of soluble mono- and polysilicate
species. Eventually the silicate species dissolved in the solution
become supersaturated which leads to the formation of small SiO2 domains on the surface of the remaining silica NPs (Figure 1a, step 1).51,55,56

In (b) and (c) SEM images of SiO2-S and SiO2-R NPs with a silica particle diameter of ∼155 nm are shown,
respectively. (d) Single reflection ATR-FTIR absorbance spectra of
155SiO2-S, 155SiO2-R, 155SiO2-R-NH2, 155SiO2-RP, and 155SiO2-SP NPs. The
black arrows in the FTIR spectra indicate characteristic FTIR absorbance
values of the (modified) silica NPs. (e) Non-isothermal TGA thermograms
of the 155SiO2-S-NH2, 155SiO2-R-NH2, 155SiO2-SP, and 155SiO2-RP NPs.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of SiO2-S
and SiO2-R NPs with a diameter of approximately 155 nm
are shown in Figure 1b,c, respectively. The diameter of the SiO2-R NPs is defined
as the diameter of a circle just large enough to enclose the SiO2-R NP outer surface. Particles with diameters between 80 and
200 nm were prepared (see Materials and Methods section). Hereinafter, the numbers preceding “SiO2” refer to the apparent particle diameter. For instance, 155SiO2-S refers to an NP with an average diameter of 155 nm.

From Figure 1c,
it is obvious that small silica domains (with diameters of ∼20–30
nm) are present at the surface of the NPs after treatment with NaBH4, which is in agreement with the deposition of silicate species
on the silica particle surface during the reaction.51 Following the successful synthesis of SiO2-R
NPs with diameters of ∼80 nm, ∼120 nm, ∼155 nm,
and ∼200 nm, a PDMS shell was grafted to the surface to yield
the corresponding hybrid (SiO2-RP) NPs (Figure 1a). In brief, SiO2-R was derivatized with (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES),
resulting in the formation of amine-functionalized NPs (SiO2-R-NH2) (step 2). Subsequently, PDMS-grafted core–shell
NPs were prepared by the “grafting to” approach with
monoglycidyl ether-terminated PDMS (step 3). We note here that prolonged
sonication or even melt blending did not destroy the surface roughness
of the (hybrid) raspberry-like NPs; that is, the NPs are stable enough
for utilization as nucleating particles in nanocellular foaming.

Figure 1d shows
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorbance spectra of SiO2, SiO2-R, SiO2-R-NH2, SiO2-RP, and nearly smooth PDMS-grafted NPs (SiO2-SP) with
a (silica core) diameter of ∼155 nm. The ethoxy groups remaining
after the Stöber reaction with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)
are clearly observed in the FTIR spectra of the 155SiO2-S particles; that is, the CH2/CH3 bending
absorbance band at 1452 cm–1 and the CH2/CH3 absorbance band at 2980 cm–1.57 After NaBH4 etching to yield surface-roughened
NPs, these absorbance bands disappear, which indicates quantitative
hydrolysis of the remaining ethoxy groups of the 155SiO2-R NPs.51 The bands at 2980 cm–1, 1450 cm–1, and 1380 cm–1 reappearing
in the FTIR spectrum of 155SiO2-R-NH2 are assigned
to the CH2 groups of the propyl spacer of surface tethered
APTES. The presence of absorption bands ascribed to CH3 stretching at 2967 cm–1 and to C–H bending
at 1263 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of 155SiO2-RP NPs confirms the successful grafting of PDMS.58 The same absorption bands are observed in the
FTIR spectrum of SiO2-SP NPs; their synthesis is described
in the Materials and Methods section.

To determine the amount of PDMS grafted to the silica NPs, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was employed. Figure 1e shows the weight loss versus temperature
curves for non-isothermal TGA measurements of nearly spherical and
raspberry-like, amino-functionalized and PDMS-grafted NPs with silica
(core) diameters of approximately 155 nm. The results clearly show
that the amount of PDMS covalently bound to the SiO2 NPs
with a rough surface is significantly higher, that is, ∼10.3
wt %, than the amount covalently bound to the spherical NPs, that
is, ∼3.0 wt %. This nearly 3.4-fold increase in grafted PDMS
weight is ascribed to the increased specific surface area of the raspberry-like
NPs compared to the spherical NPs, as shown in Figure S1. For the NPs with a diameter of 155 nm, the surface
area increased from 32.4 m2 g–1 for the
spherical NPs to 116.0 m2 g–1 for the
raspberry-like NPs (see Figure S1). The
nearly 3.6-fold increase in surface area is in good agreement with
the 3.4-fold increase in amount of grafted PDMS. For the raspberry-like
silica NPs with diameters of 200 and 120 nm, the increase in PDMS
grafting wt % was in good agreement with the corresponding increase
in surface area.

Based on the grafted PDMS mass obtained by
TGA measurements, the
molar mass of the grafted PDMS chains (i.e., 1000 g mol–1), and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the NPs, the PDMS grafting densities were calculated
to be ∼0.6 chains nm–2 for the 155SiO2-SP and 155-SiO2-RP NPs. This number is lower than
the earlier reported value of 0.9 for SiO2-SP NPs with
diameters from 12 to 120 nm.59 This difference
is ascribed to the known overestimation of the surface area of Stöber
silica NPs determined by BET measurements60−62 compared to
the NP surface area calculated by simple arithmetic estimation based
on the particle diameter. When using this simple arithmetic method
for the determination of the grafting density of the SiO2-SP NPs with a particle diameter from 80 to 200 nm, grafting density
values close to 0.9 chains nm–2 were obtained. This
result is in good agreement with values for SiO2-SP NPs
reported in our previous work.59 Based
on these results, we note that BET analysis is used here only to qualitatively
show the significant differences in the surface area of the particles
before and after roughening their surface.

Finally, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm
the core–shell structure of the PDMS-grafted NPs. Figure 2a–d shows
TEM images of 155 nm bare and PDMS-grafted spherical and raspberry-like
NPs. From these TEM images, it is clear that there is a thin PDMS
shell around the 155SiO2-SP (Figure 2b) and 155SiO2-RP (Figure 2d) NPs. The thickness of the
PDMS shell on the NPs was estimated to be approximately 6.0 ±
1.5 nm, which agrees well with previous results reported for SiO2-SP NPs with silica-core diameters from 12 to 120 nm.59

Following the successful synthesis and characterization
of the
NPs, we employed them as nucleating agents in CO2-assisted
batch foaming of PMMA as presented and discussed in the next sections.

Nanocomposite Foaming and Multinucleation
Prior to
foaming, the designer NPs were melt-blended in a PMMA matrix and pressed
into films with a thickness of approximately 200 μm. For comparison
of the nucleation efficiency, NPs with the same volume number density
(i.e., 1.07 × 1013 particles cm–3) were used for each nanocomposite
film. Thus, assuming that the particles are well dispersed in the
PMMA films and that each particle can nucleate the same number of
foam cells, all nanocomposite films had the same volume number density
of potential nucleation sites prior to foaming. The particles were
well dispersed in PMMA prior to foaming, as observed from SEM images
of cross-sectioned PMMA nanocomposite films (see Figure S3, Supporting Information).

The CO2 saturation pressure used for foaming was 55 bar, and following quick
depressurization (i.e., within 2
s), foams were prepared at a foaming temperature of 40 °C for
1 s. This relatively short foaming time was chosen since we were primarily
interested in the nucleation efficiency of the prepared particles
and not in the well-developed foam morphology at the end stages of
foaming (i.e., after several tens
of seconds to min). Figure 3a–d shows SEM images of cross-sectioned PMMA foams
nucleated by 155SiO2-S, 155SiO2-SP, 155SiO2-R, and 155SiO2-RP NPs. It is clear that for the
1 s foaming time, the PMMA foams have thick cell walls and struts.
Furthermore, the 155SiO2-S, 155SiO2-SP, and
155SiO2-R NPs are present at the polymer foam cell wall
surface. The 155SiO2-S NPs are more embedded in the PMMA
cell wall than the 155SiO2-SP NPs, which can be attributed
to the low surface energy and high CO2-philicity of the
decorated PDMS shell compared with the bare particles, resulting in
the different interfacial interactions between the nanoparticles and
the polymer gas mixture.63 This is in good
agreement with the reported results for the nucleation behavior of
pristine SiO2 and corresponding PDMS-grafted core–shell
NPs with (core) diameters up to 120 nm.33,59

Figure 3 SEM images
of cross-sectioned PMMA foams nucleated by (a) 155SiO2-S,
(b) 155SiO2SP, (c) 155SiO2-R, (d)
155SiO2-RP, (e) 80SiO2-RP, and (f) 200SiO2-RP NPs. The white arrows in (d) and (f) point toward the
particles showing multiple cell nucleation events per particle. The
insets show higher magnification images of nucleating NPs in cross-sectioned
PMMA foam cells. The saturation pressure, foaming temperature, and
foaming time were 55 bar, 40 °C, and 1 s, respectively.

Interestingly, when examining the 155SiO2-RP NPs embedded
in the PMMA foams, we observed that most of these particles are surrounded
by a few primary polymer foam cells (see Figure 3d). Of particular interest is that the cell
walls in between these primary foam cells are much thinner than the
non-nucleated/expanded PMMA matrix surrounding them and that the size
of the cells around the 155SiO2-RP particles is fairly
uniform. This observation points toward simultaneous multiple heterogeneous
nucleation events per added particle. In addition, the thin wall between
some foam cells appears to be ruptured or partly disappeared. This
result indicates that cell coalescence occurs during the initial stages
of nucleation. An explanation for this behavior is provided later.

The occurrence of multiple nucleation events per 155SiO2-RP particles is promising for developing nanocellular foams with
increased cell densities. To successfully exploit this possibility,
it is of pivotal importance to obtain a deeper understanding of cell
nucleation as a function of the surface roughening feature sizes.
Therefore, we prepared SiO2-R and SiO2-RP NPs
with diameters of ∼80 nm, ∼120 nm, and ∼200 nm
to explore this idea. Figure S2 shows SEM
images of 80SiO2-R, 120SiO2-R, and 200SiO2-R NPs. It is clear that the feature sizes of the roughened
surfaces are different among the particles with different diameters,
that is, 80SiO2-R has only a few small protrusions at its
surface, while 200SiO2-R reveals numerous larger protruding
features (Figure S2). It turned out that
for the etching method used the initial Stöber silica NP size
has an impact on the particle roughness.51

The SEM images of the cross-sectioned PMMA foams nucleated
by 80SiO2-RP (Figure 3e) and 200SiO2-RP (Figure 3f) reveal distinct differences in the foam
morphology
as well. For instance, the images of the foam nucleated by 200SiO2-RP NPs clearly show the presence of multiple cells around
single nucleating particles; however, no multiple cell nucleation
events are observed around single 80SiO2-RP NPs.

Below, we present how the nucleation efficiency of SiO2-RP NPs depends on the particle surface roughness for a PMMA foam
prepared with a foaming time of 1 s. Figure 4 shows the cell size (4a), cell density (4b),
and nucleation efficiency (4c) values for foams nucleated by SiO2-S, SiO2-SP, SiO2-R, and SiO2-RP NPs as a function of the silica particle diameter.

Figure 4 (a) Foam cell
size, (b) cell density, and (c) cell nucleation efficiency
for PMMA foams nucleated by SiO2-S, SiO2-SP,
SiO2-R, and SiO2-RP NPs with diameters of ∼80
nm, ∼120 nm, ∼155 nm, and ∼200 nm. The saturation
pressure, foaming temperature, and foaming time were 55 bar, 40 °C,
and 1 s, respectively. The insets in (c) show SEM images of cross-sectioned
PMMA foam cells showing the presence of multiple cells around single
155SiO2-RP and 200SiO2-RP NPs.

As can be clearly seen from Figure 4a, the average cell size nucleated with SiO2-RP NPs is smaller than that nucleated with SiO2-S, SiO2-SP and SiO2-R NPs with the same diameter.
In addition,
upon increasing the particle diameter from 80 to 200 nm, the average
cell size decreases, and the cell size distribution becomes narrower.
SEM images of cross-sectioned PMMA foams nucleated by 80SiO2-RP particles did not reveal any multiple cell nucleation events
per particle (see Figure 3e), while for 120SiO2-RP, this phenomenon was observed
for some particles (Figure S4). The decrease
in the number of multiple nucleation events is ascribed to the lower
surface roughness of the 80-SiO2-RP and 120SiO2-RP NPs, that is, resulting in a reduced number of effective nanocavities.
However, for the PMMA foams nucleated by 155SiO2-RP and
200SiO2-RP particles, multiple cell nucleation events were
observed, resulting in a higher CO2 consumption during
cell growth than that during the growth of the foams without multiple
cell nucleation events. This finding explains the reduction in cell
size to 160 ± 50 nm and 110 ± 60 nm for the foams nucleated
with 155SiO2-RP and 200SiO2-RP particles, respectively.

The occurrence of multiple cell nucleation events for SiO2-RP NPs with various roughnesses has, as expected, a significant
effect on the cell density and nucleation efficiency values (Figure 4b,c). Compared to
the other particle types, the 200SiO2-RP NPs cause, similar
to the 155SiO2-RP NPs, a significant increase in cell density
and cell nucleation efficiency. In fact, for the 200SiO2-RP NPs, the nucleation efficiency was ∼6.2, which is the
highest nucleation efficiency reported thus far.

In addition,
120SiO2-RP particles have a higher nucleation
efficiency than 120SiO2-S, 120SiO2-R, and 120SiO2-SP NPs, as well (see Figure 4c). This result is again qualitatively explained by
the presence of the nanocavities. However, 80SiO2-RP NPs
show a comparable nucleation efficiency with 80SiO2-SP
NPs, which is ascribed to the presence of mainly convex surface domains
at its particle surface. Compared to concave surface roughness, convex
structures have a higher cell nucleation free energy.47,48

From Figure 4, it
is obvious that for the particle sizes evaluated, the SiO2-R NPs have nucleation efficiencies comparable to those of the SiO2-SP NPs, while the SiO2-S particles are the least
effective nucleating agents. Overall, it is shown that NPs designed
with a concave surface roughness are more efficient for use as nucleation
agents than the nearly spherical NPs and that a combination of roughness
with a CO2-philic low surface energy PDMS shell has a very
large synergetic effect on PMMA foam cell nucleation.

Elucidation
of the Multiple Foam Cell Nucleation Mechanism
The synergetic
effect of a PDMS shell with the presence of cavities
on the nucleation efficiency of SiO2-RP NPs was much higher
than expected. In fact, we reasoned that for the higher number of
cells to grow, more CO2 as a blowing agent must be available.
Thus, the CO2 absorption of PMMA films containing SiO2-S, SiO2-SP, SiO2-R, and SiO2-RP particles with diameters of ∼80 nm, ∼120 nm, ∼155
nm, and ∼200 nm were determined to further elucidate the cell
nucleation efficiency as a function of the particle type and size.
The results are shown in Figure 5a. Clearly, PMMA films containing SiO2-S
and SiO2-SP NPs have no significant differences in CO2 absorption from PMMA films without NPs regardless of the
particle diameter. The same trend is observed for 80SiO2-R and 80SiO2-RP NPs. Hence, for these particles, the
overall CO2 concentration is not altered, while locally
in the PMMA films, the CO2 concentration may vary due to
the presence of the PDMS shell. Upon increasing the surface roughness
of the particles, for example, for the 120SiO2-R, 155SiO2-R, and 200SiO2-R NPs, the amount of CO2 absorbed is expected to significantly increase. The presence of
a PDMS shell increases the amount absorbed even more for these NPs.
For instance, for the 200SiO2-R and 200SiO2-RP
NPs, the increase in the amount of CO2 absorbed was ∼4.7
wt % and ∼8.8 wt %, respectively, compared to the PMMA film
containing no particles (∼18.2 wt %).

80 and 200 nm. The saturation
pressure and time were 55 bar and 4 h, respectively. The dashed line
shows the CO2 absorption by PMMA containing no NPs. (b)

5 s, (e) 1 s, and (f) 0.3 s. In the insets, the foam cell wall around
a single nanoparticle is shown. The saturation pressure and foaming
temperature were 55 bar and 40 °C, respectively.

This increase in CO2 absorption for the rough
particles
is ascribed to capillary condensation of CO2 in the nanocavities.64−66 The even larger increase in CO2 absorption for the rough
particles with a PDMS shell with diameters of ∼120 nm, ∼155
nm, and ∼200 nm compared to their bare counterparts is attributed
to the presence of CO2-philic molecules attached to the
nanocavity surfaces, which is known to potentially enhance the absorption
of CO2.67−69

The higher physical blowing agent concentration
close to the particle
surface is favorable for increasing the nucleation rate, and combined
with the presence of a low surface energy PDMS shell in the nanocavities,
this property leads to a significant enhancement in the foam cell
nucleation efficiency of these particles. Figure 5b shows a schematic representation of the
assumed mechanism leading to multiple cell nucleation events for raspberry-like
PDMS-grafted silica NPs. Upon saturation of PMMA films containing
SiO2-RP NPs, CO2 capillary condensation in the
cavities results in the presence of significantly increased amounts
of CO2 in close proximity to the nucleating particle surface.
The nanocavities are energetically favorable nucleating sites and,
together with the increased amount of available CO2, result
in more than one nucleating event per particle (step A) and subsequent
cell growth (step B) and cell coalescence (step C). This mechanism
is further experimentally confirmed by the development of the foam
cell morphology as a function of the foaming time for PMMA foams nucleated
by 155SiO2-RP NPs, as shown in Figure 5c–f. Upon increasing the foaming time,
the cell walls between these primary foam cells nucleated from the
same single 155SiO2-RP appear to be ruptured or partly
disappeared, leading to cell coalescence. In addition, the cell size
and cell nucleation efficiency for PMMA foams, nucleated with 155SiO2-S, 155SiO2-SP, 155SiO2-R, and 155SiO2-RP NPs, were also determined as a function of the foaming
time (see Figure S5).

Overall, we
experimentally demonstrated that multiple cell nucleation
events on a single NP can be obtained through the use of PDMS-decorated
core–shell raspberry-like NPs as nucleation agents. These designer
NPs exhibit significantly higher cell nucleation efficiency in PMMA
nanocellular foaming than their bare and nearly spherical counterparts.
We also utilized 155SiO2-RP NPs in the CO2-assisted
batch foaming of polystyrene, and the corresponding SEM images also
revealed the occurrence of multiple cell nucleation events (see Figure S6). Hence, these hybrid core–shell
NPs are very promising as highly efficient cell nucleation agents
in polymer nanocellular foaming in general.

To fully exploit
the high nucleation efficiency of SiO2-RP particles, it
is of pivotal importance to find foaming strategies
and foam matrixes that both allow the introduction of a high number
of cell nuclei and ensure early cell stabilization during the foaming
process to prevent cell coalescence. For instance, without optimization
of any of the foaming parameters or the composition of the PMMA nanocomposite
matrix, we obtained a high cell density of ∼6.6 × 1013 cells cm–3, which is already very close
to the order of magnitude of interest (i.e., 1014 cells cm–3). Future
work must be directed toward developing new strategies for sufficiently
increasing the surface roughness of NPs with a particle diameter <100
nm. This objective is essential since at the same weight percentage
of particle loading, a higher number of effective nucleation agents
is available when smaller particles are used.

Conclusion
In summary, bare and PDMS-decorated nearly spherical and raspberry-like
silica NPs were synthesized and utilized as efficient nucleation agents
in CO2-blown PMMA nanocellular foams. Raspberry-like nanoparticles
with a thin PDMS shell exhibit a higher nucleation efficiency than
their nearly spherical counterparts. Multiple nucleating events per
particle were observed for SiO2-RP NPs with core diameters
of 155 and 200 nm. The highest nucleation efficiency obtained was
6.2 for 200SiO2-RP NPs. The significantly higher nucleation
efficiency (well above unity) of the core–shell raspberry-like
nanoparticles is attributed to the synergistic effect between the
thin PDMS shell and the presence of cavities on the nanoparticles
surface as well as the higher CO2 absorption. This results
in an increased physical blowing agent concentration available for
nucleation close to the energetically favorable nanocavities serving
as nucleating sites. Hence, PDMS-decorated core–shell raspberry-like
nanoparticles are very promising for use as an interesting class of
highly efficient nucleation agents. To improve our understanding of
multiple cell nucleation events, future work should be directed toward
the quantification of the relationship between nucleation energy barrier
and surface cavity structure dimensions as well optimization of foaming
conditions to stabilize the multiple nucleated cells during the early
stages of foaming.

Stöber Silica Nanoparticle (SiO2) Synthesis
SiO2 particles with diameters
of ∼80 nm, ∼120
nm, ∼155 nm, ∼180 nm, ∼200 nm, and ∼310
nm were prepared by the Stöber method. To prepare NPs with
a diameter of ∼155 nm, 100 mL of ethanol was mixed with 8 mL
of Milli-Q water and 10 mL of TEOS in the presence of 5 mL of ammonium
hydroxide while stirring at 500 rpm at 50 °C. After 4.5 h, the
SiO2 dispersion obtained was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm
for 30 min. Subsequently, the collected SiO2 was redispersed
in ethanol and centrifuged again. This washing step was repeated 2
more times, followed by vacuum-drying the collected SiO2 nanoparticles at room temperature for 12 h. To prepare NPs with
a diameter of ∼80 nm, 168 mL of ethanol was mixed with 28 mL
of Milli-Q water and 30 mL of TEOS in the presence of 2 mL of ammonium
hydroxide while stirring for 1.5 h at 500 rpm at room temperature.
To synthesize the ∼120 nm particles, 100 mL of ethanol was
mixed with 8 mL of Milli-Q water and 5 mL of TEOS in a round-bottom
flask stirring at 500 rpm, and subsequently 5 mL of ammonium hydroxide
was added and reacted for 3 h at 50 °C. To synthesize the ∼180
nm particles, 100 mL of ethanol was mixed with 8 mL of Milli-Q water
and 10 mL of TEOS in the presence of 5.3 mL of ammonium hydroxide
in a 250 mL round-bottom flask while stirring at 500 rpm. The reaction
was conducted for 4.5 h at 50 °C. To synthesize the ∼200
nm particles, 100 mL of ethanol was mixed with 8 mL of Milli-Q water
and 10 mL of TEOS in the presence of 5.6 mL of ammonium hydroxide
in a 250 mL round-bottom flask while stirring at 500 rpm. The reaction
was conducted for 4.5 h at 50 °C. To synthesize the ∼310
nm particles, 100 mL of ethanol was mixed with 8 mL of Milli-Q water
and 10 mL of TEOS in a round-bottom flask stirring at 500 rpm, and
subsequently, 7.0 mL of ammonium hydroxide was added and reacted for
4.5 h at 50 °C. The collection, washing, and drying steps of
these nanoparticles were the same as those described for the ∼155
nm nanoparticles.

Nanoparticles Hydrolysis
To introduce
silanol groups
on the surface of the prepared SiO2 nanoparticles, the
particles were redispersed in Milli-Q water by sonication (BRANSON
2510, Canada) for 1 h. Subsequently, hydrochloric acid was added to
the dispersion while stirring at 500 rpm until the pH of the solution
reached a value of approximately 1. After 4 h, the dispersion was
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The collected nanoparticles
were redispersed in Milli-Q water and centrifuged again. This washing
step was repeated 2 more times, followed by drying the silanol-functionalized
nanoparticles (SiO2-OH) under vacuum at room temperature
for 12 h.

APTES Modification of Silica Nanoparticles
First, 1.5
g of SiO2-OH nanoparticles were redispersed in 50 mL of
ethanol, followed by the addition of 7.5 mL of APTES. The dispersion
was left stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature for 17 h. The APTES-functionalized
nanoparticles (SiO2-NH2) were collected by centrifugation
at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, redispersed in ethanol, and centrifuged
again. This washing step was repeated 2 more times, followed by drying
the collected SiO2-NH2 nanoparticles under vacuum
at room temperature for 12 h.

PDMS-G Grafting to Silica
Nanoparticles
First, 1.0
g of SiO2-NH2 NPs was redispersed in 20.5 mL
of THF and 15 g of PDMS-G while stirring at 500 rpm for 1 h, followed
by sonication for 1 h. Subsequently, THF was removed by rotary evaporation,
and the resulting silica nanoparticle dispersion in PDMS-G was immersed
in an oil bath thermostated at 80 °C for 17 h. After cooling
to room temperature, the reaction mixture was washed with THF and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. This washing step was repeated
2 more times, followed by vacuum-drying the PDMS-G-grafted silica
nanoparticles (SiO2-SP) at room temperature for 12 h.

Synthesis and Modification of Raspberry-like Nanoparticles
To synthesize NPs with enhanced surface roughness of ∼80
nm, 0.3 g of Stöber silica NPs of ∼80 nm and 0.25 g
of PVP were redispersed in 10 mL of Milli-Q water by sonication for
30 min. Subsequently, 0.6 g of NaBH4 was added to the dispersion
while stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature for another 30 min.
The resulting mixture was reacted at 50 °C for 1 h and 15 min.
Stöber silica nanoparticles with diameters of ∼155 nm,
∼180 nm, and ∼310 nm were used to synthesize surface-roughened
nanoparticles of ∼120 nm, ∼155 nm, and ∼200 nm,
respectively, and the reactions were conducted for 3 h and 20 min,
3.5 h, and 6 h, respectively. The other steps for the synthesis of
these surface-roughened NPs (with diameters from 120 to 200 nm) were
the same as described for the synthesis of rough surface NPs of ∼80
nm. Subsequently, the obtained NPs featuring rough surfaces were collected
by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, redispersed in Milli-Q
water, and centrifuged again. This washing step was repeated 2 more
times, followed by drying the collected nanoparticles under vacuum
at room temperature for 12 h. The processes of amino functionalization
of and PDMS-G grafting to the surface-roughened nanoparticles were
the same as those described for the Stöber silica nanoparticles.

Nanocomposite Preparation
Nanocomposites were prepared
by dispersing the same amount of (functionalized) silica nanoparticles
(1.07 × 1013 cm–3) in PMMA with
a mini-extruder (DSM Xplore, The Netherlands). In a typical procedure,
a dry blend of nanoparticles and PMMA was fed to the extruder followed
by internal mixing for 3 min. The barrel temperature was set to 155
°C, and the screw speed was 100 rpm. Subsequently, the PMMA nanocomposite
was collected and left to cool to room temperature.

Film Preparation
A hot press (Fontijne, The Netherlands)
was used to press ∼0.2 mm-thick nanocomposite films in a mold
(4 × 3 cm). The press temperature, applied load, and press time
were 180 °C, 250 kN, and 10 min, respectively.

Batch Foaming
of Nanocomposite Films
The nanocomposite
PMMA films were saturated with CO2 (55 bar) in an autoclave
for 4 h at room temperature followed by rapid depressurization. Subsequently,
the PMMA nanocomposite films were immersed in a water bath thermostated
at 40 °C for different foaming times (0.3 s, 1 s, 5 s, 10 s,
or 30 s), after which the samples were quenched in an ice bath for
30 min. The samples were left to dry in air for at least 12 h prior
to further analysis.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
were collected with a Bruker ALPHA single attenuated total reflection
(ATR) FTIR spectrometer equipped with a single reflection ATR crystal
(Bruker Optic GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). The spectra were collected
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 (spectral resolution
of 4 cm–1, 128 scans). Background spectra were recorded
against air.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The weight
loss of the (modified)
particles as a function of temperature was measured with a TGA400
(PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). A sample weighing ∼3–6
mg was loaded into a platinum pan, and the temperature was set to
50 °C to stabilize. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 900
°C at a heating rate of 20 °C min–1. The
applied air flow was 20 mL min–1.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM was performed
with an FEI/Philips CM300 system (Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Diluted
particle dispersions in THF were deposited on the carbon side of a
carbon/copper grid (HC200-Cu) (EMS, Germany) prior to imaging. Images
were obtained in the bright-field mode with a 300 kV acceleration
voltage.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
For SEM, a high-resolution
scanning electron microscope (JEOL Field Emission JSM-633OF, JEOL
Benelux, Nieuw-Vennep, The Netherlands) was employed at an acceleration
voltage of 5 keV. Prior to analysis, the nanocomposite foams were
freeze fractured following cooling in liquid nitrogen for 5 min.

Surface Area Measurement for Nanoparticles
The specific
surface area of the nanoparticles was measured from the nitrogen adsorption
isotherm obtained at 300 °C using an ASAP 2010 sorptometer (Micromeritics).
Approximately 100 mg of nanoparticle powder was used for each measurement.

CO2 Absorption Measurement
To measure the
absorption of CO2, PMMA nanocomposite films containing
the same amount of the respective nanoparticles were saturated in
CO2 at 55 bar for 4 h. The weights of the PMMA (nanocomposite)
films before and after CO2 saturation were measured.

Calculation of PDMS Grafting Density
The grafting density
(D) of the PDMS-decorated NP surface was determined
according to eq 1: 1  where K = 6.02 × 1023 mol–1, which is Avogadro’s number,
and m is the weight of PDMS grafted per gram of NPs
(determined from TGA), M = 1000 g·mol–1, which is the molar mass of the PDMS used, and S is the surface area per gram of NPs, which was determined by BET.

Calculation of Cell Density and Nucleation Efficiency
The
cell size and cell density were obtained by analyzing the obtained
cross-sectional SEM images. The cell density Nv of the foams was calculated according to
Kumar’s theoretical approximation.70 No direct measurements of cell dimensions over the micrograph are
required in this method; only the micrograph area (A) and the total number of cells (n) contained therein
are measured. Together with the magnification factor of the micrograph
(M), the values enabling Nv to be calculated according to eq 2: 2  By combining Nv with the volume expansion ratio (B) of nanocomposite films after foaming, the cell numbers
per cm3 of unfoamed materials (N) can
be calculated
according to eq 3: 3  The cell densities
mentioned in the main text
are all refer to N. In addition, the nucleation efficiency
(f) of nanoparticles during foaming can be calculated
as 4  where C is the number of
nanoparticles per cm3 (i.e., 1.07 × 1013) used for foaming.

Figure S7 shows how we calculated the number
of cells in the occasion of multiple cell nucleating events occurring
around a particle.
