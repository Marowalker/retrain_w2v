Colloidal
nanocrystals (NCs) of APbX3-type lead halide
perovskites [A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ (methylammonium or MA+) or CH(NH2)2+ (formamidinium or FA+); X = Cl–, Br–, I–] have
recently emerged as highly versatile photonic sources for applications
ranging from simple photoluminescence down-conversion (e.g., for display backlighting) to light-emitting diodes. From the perspective
of spectral coverage, a formidable challenge facing the use of these
materials is how to obtain stable emissions in the red and infrared
spectral regions covered by the iodide-based compositions. So far,
red-emissive CsPbI3 NCs have been shown to suffer from
a delayed phase transformation into a nonluminescent, wide-band-gap
1D polymorph, and MAPbI3 exhibits very limited chemical
durability. In this work, we report a facile colloidal synthesis method
for obtaining FAPbI3 and FA-doped CsPbI3 NCs
that are uniform in size (10–15 nm) and nearly cubic in shape
and exhibit drastically higher robustness than their MA- or Cs-only
cousins with similar sizes and morphologies. Detailed structural analysis
indicated that the FAPbI3 NCs had a cubic crystal structure,
while the FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs had
a 3D orthorhombic structure that was isostructural to the structure
of CsPbBr3 NCs. Bright photoluminescence (PL) with high
quantum yield (QY > 70%) spanning red (690 nm, FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs) and near-infrared (near-IR, ca. 780 nm, FAPbI3 NCs) regions was sustained
for several months or more in both the colloidal state and in films.
The peak PL wavelengths can be fine-tuned by using postsynthetic cation-
and anion-exchange reactions. Amplified spontaneous emissions with
low thresholds of 28 and 7.5 μJ cm–2 were
obtained from the films deposited from FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 and FAPbI3 NCs, respectively. Furthermore,
light-emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 2.3%
were obtained by using FAPbI3 NCs.

Lead halide
perovskites with
the generic formula of APbX3 [A = CH3NH3+ (methylammonium, MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (formamidinium, FA+), or Cs+; X = I–, Br–, Cl–, or mixtures thereof] have recently been added to
the pool of high-quality semiconductors (Si, GaAs, CdTe, etc.) after demonstrations of their highly efficient perovskite photovoltaics1−4 with extremely high power conversion efficiencies of more than 22%
(http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg). This
outstanding performance was initially surprising because an extensive
structural disorder occurs in such solution-deposited semiconductors,
as exemplified by a high density of vacancies (up to 1 at. %; Schottky-type),5 unusual ionic rotations, other structural dynamics,5 and high ionic mobilities.6,7 This
defectiveness is fortunately counterweighted by the unusual defect-tolerant
photophysics of these semiconductors, a rare situation wherein intrinsic
structural defects such as vacancies, surfaces, and grain boundaries
do not form or cause only a very small density of midgap states due
to the peculiarities of the chemical bonding.8−10 Many of the
following physical parameters of these materials convincingly point
to such a defect tolerance:10−17 low densities of carriers (109–1011 cm–3) and electronic traps (109–1010 cm–3, lower than in monocrystalline Si),
high carrier mobilities (2.5–1000 cm2 V–1 s–1), long charge carrier lifetimes (0.08–450
μs), long electron–hole diffusion lengths (2–175
μm), small carrier effective masses (0.069–0.25 m0), high optical absorption coefficients at the absorption
edge (1–4.5 × 104 cm–1),
and high photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies. These properties, which
are rare in a single family of materials, enable the materials’
use in a large plethora of applications beyond photovoltaics. In addition
to the unusual and intrinsic defect tolerance, other important factors
enable the use of these materials for a range of applications, including
the facile, inexpensive, low-temperature (25–200 °C) solution-phase
synthesis of these materials in all technologically relevant forms
[bulk single crystals, thin films, microcrystals, or nanocrystals
(NCs)]. Regarding light detection, broadband and narrowband photodetectors
operating in the ultraviolet and visible near-infrared regions,18−20 soft X-ray detectors,21,22 or even gamma-detectors have been demonstrated.23 As
versatile photonic sources with emission spanning from the blue to
near-infrared regions, perovskites are highly promising for use in
LCD television displays and related remote phosphor applications,24,25 light-emitting diodes,26−33 and lasers.34−36

In the context of light-emission and photonic
applications, colloidal
perovskite NCs have emerged as materials of choice owing to the benefits
of their colloidal state (solution processability, mixability with
other materials, etc.), access to quantum-size effects,
and the possibility of shape engineering, which have stimulated efforts
to synthesize supported and colloidal nanostructures of hybrid and
fully inorganic perovskites. For example, fully inorganic cesium lead
halide NCs (CsPbX3 NCs) synthesized by using simple ionic
co-precipitation in nonpolar solvents have recently been shown to
possess outstanding optical properties, such as broadly tunable PL
(410–700 nm), a small full-width at half-maximum (fwhm = 12–40
nm for blue-to-red), and high PL quantum yields (QYs = 50–90%),
providing a broad color gamut of bright emissions.37 Considerable attention has also been devoted to hybrid
perovskites (MAPbX3 and FAPbX3) in the form
of colloidal and noncolloidal nanomaterials,38−54 with bright PL in nearly all cases. In striking contrast with perovskites,
achieving bright PL with conventional semiconductor NCs, such as CdSe,
InAs, or InP, requires elaborate synthesis to ensure electronic passivation
with the epitaxial layers of wider-gap semiconductors (e.g., CdSe/CdS and CdSe/ZnS core–shell NCs).55−57 Currently,
colloidal CsPbX3 NCs are undergoing further chemical engineering
(up-scaling, shape control, further variations of the synthesis, postsynthetic
reactivity)48,58−74 and are being intensely investigated regarding their surface chemistry,75−80 crystal structure,81−83 single-dot emission,84−89 and lasing36,90 and for their use in down-conversion
for displays,91−94 active layers in light-emitting devices,13,95−98 and solar cells.99

Green-emissive
CsPbBr3 NCs have nearly exclusively been
used as an example in most of the studies mentioned above. A particularly
pressing challenge is to obtain bright and stable red and near-infrared
(near-IR) PL from colloidal perovskite NCs. Although CsPbI3 NCs allow band-gap energies of up to 710 nm (bulk band gap) in principle,
they eventually suffer from thermodynamic instability caused by the
small size of the Cs+ ion. Thus, the NCs undergo phase
transitions from perovskite [i.e., three-dimensional (3D) connection of PbX6 octahedra]
to a 1D wider-gap (yellow) phase with an orthorhombic lattice type.
Bulk CsPbI3 material is reported to form at room temperature
(RT) exclusively in this yellow phase and becomes a 3D polymorph only
above 315 °C.100−103 CsPbI3 NCs37 and thin films104,105 often initially form
in a 3D phase, which is a metastable state, and a retarded phase transition
still occurs within days to weeks, largely depending on the surface
treatment and storage conditions, such as humidity. Our experience
with CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs also shows how this transformation
occurs, although the transformation is much slower for higher Br contents.
An alternative, phase-stable hybrid perovskite with MA+ cations, i.e., colloidal MAPbI3 NCs with small sizes (10–20 nm), suffers from chemical
instability due to its unavoidable conversion into PbI2 and volatile methylamine and HI.106,107 This challenge
that is faced when attempting to obtain small and stable iodine-containing
perovskite NCs and stable emissions in the red and near-IR spectral
ranges is called the “perovskite red wall” in this study.

In this study, we focus on a third option for the A site cationic
modulation, the use of FA+ ions, to potentially overcome
the “perovskite red wall”. We have explored the two
most plausible possibilities: the synthesis of FAPbI3 NCs
and the partial substitution of Cs+ ions in CsPbI3 with FA+ ions. We found that both compositions resulted
in highly luminescent NCs. We specifically focused on small NCs (<15
nm) to prepare highly stable and concentrated colloids when exploring
the emergence and utility of quantum-size effects and directly compared
our observations with those of earlier studies of cubic and nearly
cubic shaped 7–15 nm CsPbX3 and MAPbI3 NCs.37,49 Furthermore, when such NCs are deposited
as thin, densely packed films, they may be used in optoelectronic
devices, such as solar cells. For example, CsPbI3 NC-based
devices exhibiting power conversion efficiencies of more than 10%83 and NCs in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have
recently been investigated.

We synthesized highly monodisperse,
nearly cubic FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs with mean
sizes of 10–15 nm. These NCs exhibit much higher structural
stability and chemical integrity than their MA-only or Cs-only based
counterparts of the same size and morphology. Detailed structural
analysis has indicated (locally disordered) a 3D cubic crystal structure
for FAPbI3 NCs and an orthorhombically distorted 3D perovskite
lattice for FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs. The
orthorhombically distorted 3D perovskite lattice is isostructural
to the commonly reported orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr3.82,83 High QYs (>70%) at both red (ca. 690 nm, FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs) and near-IR (ca. 780 nm, FAPbI3 NCs) wavelengths are sustained
for at least several months in a colloidal state. In addition, we
show that the peak PL wavelengths can be fine-tuned by considering
the postsynthetic cation- and anion-exchange reactions. When tested
as optical gain media under femtosecond-pulsed excitation, FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 and FAPbI3 NC
thin films exhibited low thresholds for obtaining amplified spontaneous
emissions (ASE) (28 and 7.5 μJ cm–2, respectively).
Owing to the satisfactory chemical durability of these FA-based NCs,
LEDs could be fabricated with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE)
of up to 2.3% at near-IR wavelengths of 800 nm when using FAPbI3 NCs.

Results and Discussion
Phase Stability of FA-Containing
Perovskite NCs
APbX3 perovskites that have 3D
interconnected PbX6 are
of interest for use as effective semiconductors because this configuration
maximizes the electronic delocalization. These octahedra could be
assembled into an ideal cubic lattice (Figure 1a, typical for bulk FAPbBr3 and
FAPbI3 at RT) or its distorted versions, such as 3D orthorhombic
(Figure 1b, typical
for CsPbBr3 at RT) or 3D tetragonal (typical for MAPbI3 at RT, not shown here) versions. More details regarding the
crystal chemistry of perovskites can be found in recent reviews.108 The stabilities of these 3D polymorphs and
the 3D polymorphs following their phase transformation into lower-dimensional
and hence wider-band-gap structures, such as the 1D structures shown
in Figure 1c,d, are
of paramount importance for the practical use of perovskites in any
solid-state device. In the case of iodide, severe challenges have
been encountered. Bulk CsPbI3 is found at RT exclusively
in the yellow, orthorhombic 1D phase, which can be converted to the
desired 3D polymorph (band gap at 710 nm) only above 315 °C.100−103 Similarly, the bulk cubic 3D polymorphs of FAPbI3 (so-called α-FAPbI3),12,16,102,109−111 with a band gap in the near-IR spectrum
at 840 nm, are typically found in as-grown single crystals (grown
above 100 °C) and exhibit thermodynamic instability toward their
conversion to a wider-band-gap (yellow) hexagonal 1D phase.12,110 The desired 3D polymorphs of FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 can be obtained as metastable phases in thin films, which still
undergo phase transformations over several hours to several weeks
and transform faster when exposed to the ambient atmosphere.73,105,112,113

Figure 1 Survey
of the reported formabilities of the 3D and 1D polymorphs
of nearly all known inorganic and hybrid ABX3 compounds,
where A is an alkali metal, organic cation (MA+ or FA+), or other single-charged metal ion (Ag+, Tl+, or Cu+); B = Pb, Sn, Mg, Ca, Sr Ba, Ti, V, Cd,
Hg, Mn, Cu, Co, Zn, Tm, Dy, or Yb; and X = F, Cl, Br, of I. The tolerance
and octahedral factors were mainly taken from the recent report of
Travis etal.114 (a) Ideal 3D cubic interconnection of PbX6 octahedra,
as observed in α-FAPbI3; (b) orthorhombically distorted
3D polymorph, which is commonly reported for CsPbBr3 and
was observed in FA-doped CsPbI3 NCs in this study; (c)
1D hexagonal lattice found in the yellow FAPbI3; and (d)
1D orthorhombic lattice found in the yellow CsPbI3.

The compositionally dependent
formability of perovskites can be
semiquantitatively rationalized by using geometric principles and
by assuming ionic bonding. The Goldsmith tolerance factor (t) concept, which was initially proposed for metal-oxide
perovskites115 and recently extended to
metal halides,114,116−119 predicts that the radii of the constituting ions cannot deviate
too far from the dense packing in an ideal cubic 3D perovskite. Correspondingly,
a tolerance factor (t) can be calculated as follows:  where rA, rB, and rX represent
the ionic radii of each lattice site constituent. Empirical knowledge
shows that stable cubic perovskites for highly ionic compounds, such
as oxides and fluorides, usually fall into the range t = 0.8–1. In addition, the formability of the BX6 octahedra is determined by the following so-called octahedral factor:  For μ < 0.41, a B-ion is too small
and its efficient coordination will require overlapping between the
X-anions; hence such a compound does not form.

Purely geometric
considerations for APbX3 remain highly
accurate for fluorides, which are highly ionic compounds, but progressively
inaccurate for heavier halides (Br, I). For the heavier halides, the
difference in the electronegativity between B and X is much lower
than the difference in the electronegativity between fluorides and
oxides, leading to much higher covalency of the bonding. On the Pauling
electronegativity scale, I is at 2.66, O is at 3.16, and F is at 3.98.
Recently, Travis etal. indicated
that the tolerance f actor calculated by using the Shannon ionic radii
(which is usually used for ionic fluorides and oxides) failed to accurately
predict the stability of three dozen known inorganic iodide perovskites
with ABI3 compositions.114 These
authors proposed a revised set of ionic radii for cations that is
anion dependent to account for bond shortening due to increased covalency.
For instance, the revised radius of Pb2+ was 0.98 Å
in bromides and 1.03 Å in iodides, which are significantly shorter
than the Shannon ion radius of 1.19 Å. For Cs+, Br–, and I–, Shannon radii of 1.88,
1.96, and 2.2 Å, respectively, were used to calculate t and μ. Overall, all known stable metal bromides
and iodide 3D perovskites have t>0.88 and μ
> 0.41. The data from Travis et al.114 for all known APbX3 compounds are
shown in Figure 1e,
which indicates
a clear-cutoff at t = 0.88 and μ = 0.41. The
revised t and μ values for CsPbBr3 (0.92 and 0.5) and CsPbI3 (0.89 and 0.47) explain why
CsPbBr3 is heavily orthorhombically distorted but still
3D at RT, whereas CsPbI3 is stable only at elevated temperatures.
The upper boundaries for both the t and μ values
are not well-defined, and stable perovskites with organic cations
are found up to t = 1.1 and μ = 0.89.

Regarding hybrid MAPbX3 and FAPbI3 perovskites,
the nonsphericity of the cation is an additional consideration. While
μ-values remain unchanged, the value of t will
largely depend on the estimate for the effective radius of the cation
A. Travis etal. estimated radii
of 2.16 Å for MA+ and 2.53 Å for FA+ by summing the distance from the center of mass of the molecule
to its furthest non-hydrogen atom and the Shannon ionic radius of
the nitride (N3–) anion (1.46 Å). No hybrid
perovskites based on larger ions such as ethylammonium (EA+, 2.73 Å) have been reported to date, indicating that t = 1.06 can be considered as the empirical limit (EAPbI3 and EASnI3 have tolerance factors of 1.07 and
1.10, respectively). The corresponding tolerance factors for known
MA- and FA-based Pb and Sn perovskites are (in parentheses; along
with the known stabilities of the cubic or distorted 3D lattice at
RT) MAPbI3 (0.95; stable),16,110 FAPbI3 (1.03, unstable),16,110 MASnI3 (0.97,
stable),120,121 FASnI3 (1.06, stable),122,123 MAPbBr3 (0.95, stable),110 FAPbBr3 (1.08, stable),94 MAPbCl3 (1.00, stable),15 and FAPbCl3 (1.09, stable).124,125 Other compounds (such
as FASnBr3 and FASnCl3) have not been reported
so far (see Table S1 for a complete survey
of all compounds and Table S2 for all ionic
radii considered). Clearly, no apparent explanation exists regarding
the formability of 3D phases at RT for some of the compounds, based
neither on t nor on μ. For instance, the 3D
polymorph of FAPbI3 exhibits instability despite having
lower t values than the stable 3D polymorphs of FASnI3 and FAPbBr3. Equally puzzling is the question
of why some of the other hybrid perovskites exhibit ideal cubic lattices
while others are distorted at RT. Possible answers lie in recent reports
highlighting the importance of vibrational entropy for stabilizing
the trigonal distortion in MAPbI3126 and the entropic destabilization of α-FAPbI3127 at RT, various N–H·I hydrogen-bonding
capabilities (with MA+ being more acidic, but FA+ having two bonding centers),128,129 the propensity of
the Pb2+ lone pair to express its stereochemistry,129 and the relevance of packing density for stability
(that can explain the higher stability of FAPbBr3versus FAPbI3).130−134

These considerations provide guidance
for creating experimental
strategies to improve the stability of non-MA (i.e., Cs and FA lead iodide NCs). An obvious approach, derived
from the high stability of the respective Br analogues, is to prepare
mixed halides with Br, such as CsPb(Br/I)3, which has already
been tested in several reports,135,136 or analogous
FAPb(Br/I)3.137,138 This strategy is not
used here because it increases the band-gap energies and results in
PL peaks below 650 nm, which are irrelevant to the perovskite “red
wall” problem. To retain emissions near 700 nm and beyond,
a different strategy is used, namely, partial Cs-to-FA substitution
in CsPbI3 NCs or partial FA-to-Cs substitution in FAPbI3 NCs, to ensure that a composition-averaged t value falls within the stability window. Such cation mixing at the
A site may not only optimize the structural tolerance but also cause
an additional stabilizing effect from the entropy of mixing (on the
order of 0.05 eV).139 Analogous strategies
have become ubiquitous in thin-film photovoltaic research. For instance,
all major recent advances in the simultaneous improvement of stability
and photovoltaic efficiencies have been shown with mixed-ionic compositions
either on the cation side, as in CsxFA1–xPbI3 (x ≤ 0.3) or MAxFA1–xPbI3 (x = 0.2–1),
or with simultaneous adjustment of the anionic side, such as in Cs0.17FA0.83(PbI1–xBrx)3 (x =
0–1) or (FAPbI3)1–x(MAPbBr3)x (x = 0–0.3) or even with a cation quadruple (Cs/MA/FA/Rb)
(PbI1–xBrx)3.4,139−144 As shown below in this work, Cs0.9FA0.1PbI3 NCs are much more stable than CsPbI3 NCs.

Downsizing has a profound effect on the phase stability of inorganic
NCs due to the interplay of kinetic trapping (low-T synthesis) and thermodynamics (i.e., surface energy).
A renowned example of this effect is the phase-pure synthesis of zinc-blende
or wurzite CdSe and other II–VI compound NCs, depending on
the synthesis temperature or capping ligand.145,146 Similarly, colloidal CsPbI3 NCs
synthesized at 120–180 °C form in a high-temperature 3D
phase. This structure remains metastable at RT and eventually converts
to the 1D orthorhombic phase, and its phase stability exhibits a pronounced
correlation with the processing conditions (isolation, purification,
and surface treatment).37

However,
less information is known about the phase stability of
small FAPbI3 NCs, which serves as one motivation for this
work. Small NCs are generally known to adjust their strain distribution
and lattice parameters, compared to their bulk counterparts. Detrimental
effects of the bulkiness of the organic cation in α-FAPbI3 NCs could be, in principle, mitigated to some extent by the
slight expansion of the lattice. Recently, FAPbI3 single-crystalline
wires several hundred nanometers to several micrometers in diameter
were reported to exhibit phase stability for up to several weeks.147 Encouraged by the expectation that lattice
adaptability will be drastically facilitated by small NCs, we synthesized
∼10 nm FAPbI3 NCs and observed their full stability
in a cubic α-FAPbI3 polymorph without any detectable
conversion upon extended storage for several months. As described
in the following sections of this article, this enhanced stability
may partially originate from the lattice expansion.

Synthesis and
Crystal Structure of FAPbI3 NCs
We developed two
synthesis methods for obtaining nearly cubic 10–15
nm FAPbI3 NCs (Figure 2) by using strategies from our earlier studies of CsPbX3 and FAPbBr3 NCs.37,148 In the method
1 (the two-precursor approach), lead halide is reacted with FA-oleate.
Briefly, PbI2 (0.086 g, 0.187 mmol) was dissolved at 80
°C in 1-octadecene (ODE, 5 mL) containing oleic acid (OA, 1 mL)
and oleylamine (0.5 mL, OLA), which resulted in a clear yellow solution.
This solution was kept at 80 °C and swiftly injected with a solution
of FA-oleate in ODE (0.25 M, 2 mL). Unlike the synthesis of CsPbI3 NCs,37 which required a high excess
of Pb (molar ratio Pb:Cs = 3.75) and high temperatures (120–200
°C), FAPbI3 NCs form exclusively under conditions
with excess FA (FA:Pb = 2.7) and at 80 °C (see further details
in the Methods section). In addition, excess
OA is necessary, presumably to maintain the protonation of FA. When
excess OLA is present, FAPbI3 NCs decompose rather quickly,
often before the solution can be cooled to RT and the NCs can be isolated.
The solvent used for this reaction (ODE) can also be replaced with
mesitylene without compromising the quality of the NCs. Attempts to
replace the traditional OA/OLA ligand couple with shorter-chain molecules,
such as octanoic acid and octylamine, were unsuccessful. The crude
solution was centrifuged to obtain the NCs. Next, the NCs were redispersed
in toluene and precipitated again using acetonitrile as a nonsolvent.
This purification step was repeated two more times.

range of 3–30°; λ = 0.565 483 Å) for
FAPbI3 NCs using the cubic lattice, yielding a refined
cell parameter of a = 6.3641 Å. The inset illustrates
the cubic perovskite structure of FAPbI3 and the off-axis
disorder of the I– anions. (b, c) High-resolution
TEM images of FAPbI3 NCs; (d) typical TEM image of FAPbI3 NCs; (f) aspect ratio histogram for FAPbI3 NCs.

The formation of FAPbI3 NCs was not observed at higher
injection temperatures (>80 °C) when using this method; however,
at temperatures below 50 °C, nanosheets with sizes between 0.2
and 0.5 μm were obtained (Figure 3). According to Weidman etal.,149 the observed emission
peak at approximately 580 nm corresponds to nanoplatelets with the
chemical formula (Oleyl-NH3)2[FAPbI3]PbI4 and with two layers of corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra terminated by OLA ligands.149 Similar PL peaks or absorption edge wavelengths were previously
observed for two-layer lead iodide perovskites obtained during the
thickness-controlled synthesis of colloidal and supported nanostructures42,46 and in Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid phases.150

(b and c) Corresponding TEM images showing 0.1–0.6 μm
nanosheets.

In method 2 (three-precursor
approach), molecular OLA was excluded.
Briefly, a mixture of FA-oleate and Pb-oleate was formed by reacting
FA-acetate (0.078 g, 0.75 mmol) and Pb(acetate)2 (0.076
g, 0.2 mmol) with OA (dried, 2 mL) in ODE as a solvent (8 mL). This
mixture was heated to 80 °C, and oleylammonium iodide (OLA:HI,
0.237 g, 0.6 mmol) dissolved in toluene (anhydrous, 2 mL) was injected
at 80 °C before quenching the reaction after 1 min (see the Materials and Methods section for further details).

Both methods yield highly monodisperse FAPbI3 NCs (Figure 2d) with nearly cubic
shapes (⟨Lshort⟩ = 10 nm,
⟨Llong⟩ = 12 nm, Figure 2e). The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show an interplanar
distance of 3.2 Å associated with the (200) reflection plane.

To accurately determine the crystal structure of the FAPbI3 NCs, we obtained synchrotron X-ray total scattering measurements
of the NCs in a toluene solution (Figure 2a) at the X04SA-MS4 Powder Diffraction Beamline
of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, CH).151 The XRD patterns suggested the occurrence of a cubic structure corresponding
to the α-phase of the bulk material.137 However, similar to previous observations of other lead halide perovskites
(single-crystalline CsPbCl3153 and FAPbBr3 NCs148), we modeled
the splitting off-axis of the I– ion position (considering the Pb–I–Pb axis). Notably,
all reported structural analyses of the bulk α-FaPbI3 indicate regular positioning of the I atoms along the Pb–I–Pb
axis.12,102,109,110,127,129,152 After disordering the I– anions into four equivalent positions, conventional
Rietveld refinement provided Pb–I–Pb bond angles of
166.8°, which was similar to the scenario observed in our previous
study of FAPbBr3 NCs.148 This
positional splitting also explains the anomalous thermal parameter
of I–, which is reported to be a severely anisotropic
(disk-like) ellipsoid.152

Next, we
modeled the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the NCs
using Debye function analysis (DFA) based on the Debye scattering
equation (DSE)154,155 by combining the disordered
crystal structure and the NC shape within a unifying atomistic model.
To account for the slightly anisotropic NC morphology suggested by
TEM analysis, a bottom-up approach was used to generate the bivariate
population of NCs grown according to two independent directions, one
along the c-axis and one parallel to the ab-plane (Figure S2). The small
lattice expansion observed herein (0.1% with respect to the bulk value)129 could be a manifestation of surface inflation,
possibly stabilizing the NCs. Because the observed lattice parameter
(6.3641 Å) is averaged over the inner (core) and outer (shell)
interatomic contacts of the entire NC population and less than a quarter
of atoms lie within 1 nm of the surface, the actual magnitude of the
surface-relaxation effect is likely underestimated.

Synthesis and
Crystal Structure of FAxCs1–xPbI3 NCs
(x ≤ 0.1)
First, PbI2 (0.086
g, 0.187 mmol) was dissolved at 120 °C under vacuum in ODE (5
mL) containing OA (1 mL) and OLA (0.5 mL) to form a clear yellow solution.
Next, the solution was heated to 165 °C (under N2)
and a mixture of FA-oleate (0.25 M in ODE, 0.27 mL) and Cs-oleate
(0.125 M in ODE, 0.27 mL) was injected, resulting in overall molar
ratios of A:Pb = 0.53:1 (A = FA+Cs) and FA:Cs = 2:1. Next, the NCs
were isolated using the same procedure described above for FAPbI3 NCs. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES) all indicated that the Cs:Pb atomic ratio was
0.9:1 (near the ideal ratio of 1:1 for FA-free synthesis). To accurately
identify the crystal structures of the NCs, synchrotron XRD patterns
were collected. A 3D perovskite orthorhombic lattice (space group: Pbnm) was found in both FA-doped and FA-free CsPbI3 NCs that was isostructural to the lattice commonly reported for
bulk and nanocrystalline CsPbBr3 (Figure 1b).14,82,83 Additional details regarding this rather surprising finding will
be published elsewhere. Herein we note that the insertion of approximately 10% FA+ cations into the CsPbI3 lattice
only marginally affects the cell parameters and does not change the
relative intensities of the diffraction peaks because the FA+ cations are light elements with much lower X-ray scattering power
(Figure 4a). Also for
these materials, the results from the DFA model show a nearly cubic
shape (Figure S3), which is in good agreement
with the TEM analysis (Figure 4b–e).

FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs using the γ-orthorhombic
phase of CsPbI3. The inset illustrates the γ-orthorhombic
phase of CsPbI3. (b, c) HRTEM and (d) TEM images for FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs, along with (e) a histogram
of the aspect ratio.

When the A:Pb ratio is varied from 0.53:1 to 2.7:1 and the
FA:Cs
ratio is varied from 0.5:1 to 6:1, the position of the PL peak for
FAxCs1–xPbI3 NCs is not affected considerably (<10 nm, this
small shift could be induced by the NC size variation, Figure S4). Furthermore, we have attempted to
use another method, namely, a reverse injection of PbI2 precursor into a Cs-oleate and FA-oleate mixture in ODE. However,
this method also lacks apparent tunability of the PL peak. These observations
suggest a preference for a single FA/Cs composition. Indeed, RBS,
EDX, and ICP-OES analyses all indicated a 10% deficit in Cs+ compared to CsPbI3 NCs. Finally, it is also plausible
that the FA+ cations only substitute for Cs+ in the outermost shell of the NCs.

Optical Properties of FAPbI3 NCs and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs
The FAPbI3 NCs exhibit PL emission peaks at approximately
770–780 nm
with typical QYs greater than 70% and a fwhm of 45 nm. For comparison,
the PL peaks at 810–840 nm are commonly reported for bulk and
thin-film α-FAPbI3.12,109,112 The insertion of FA+ into the CsPbI3 NCs structure increased the period of stability of the CsPbI3 NCs from several days to a few months. The emission peak
of FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs appears at
685 nm, and the obtained QYs exceeded 70% (Figure 5a). Both FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs retain their high QY in solution
(with less than 5% relative decrease) after several months of storage
at ambient conditions (Figure 5a). The PL time-resolved traces of FAPbI3 NCs exhibited
nearly monoexponential characteristics with average relaxation times
of 70 ns (Figure 5b),
which were similar to the relaxation times observed for FAPbI3 thin films.138 FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs have short radiative lifetimes
of approximately 51 ns. The decay of PL in the solutions did not noticeably
change with the number of washings for all of the studied samples.
In contrast with the solution measurements, the radiative times in
the films are faster, especially for NCs washed multiple times (down
to 5 ns; Figure S5). As expected, this
effect is accompanied by decreasing QYs (Figure
S6). The FAPbI3 NC films exhibited better QY retention
under identical testing/processing conditions (Figure S6). Particularly, when washed and annealed at 100
°C (1 h), the FAPbI3 NC films retained a QY of 20%.
Analogous tests with FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs resulted in QYs < 10%. Both FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 and FAPbI3 NCs exhibit much better chemical
durability than their CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 cousins
of similar size and shape (see comparison with our earlier work37,49 in Table S3).

colloidal solutions in toluene under daylight (upper image) and under
a UV lamp (λ = 365 nm; lower image). (b) PL decay traces for
colloidal FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs.

Cation/Anion Exchange
Although fast anion exchange
is well-documented and commonly used for fine-tuning the wavelengths
of PL peaks,64,65 cation exchange has been reported
only in thin films where FA+ is replaced by MA+ or vice versa and the underlying crystal structure
is retained.156−158 Herein, we show that Cs+ and
FA+ can be exchanged by using FA-oleate or Cs-oleate as
precursors (Figure 6a), despite the costs associated with the atomic rearrangement between
cubic FAPbI3 and γ-orthorhombic CsPbI3. Furthermore, FAPbI3 NCs can be subjected to anion exchange,
resulting in band gaps of 570 to 780 nm (Figure 6b). The halide sources for anion exchange
were oleylammonium halides (OAm+I– and
OAm+Br–; see the Materials
and Methods section for further details). After partial exchange
of I– with Br– within FAPbI3 NCs, QYs are maintained at high values and the fwhm are preserved
for PL peak maxima above 670 nm. Further incorporation of Br ions
decreases the QY, culminating in a low value of only a few percent
for (nearly) pure FAPbBr3 NCs.

and after cation exchange within FAPbI3 NCs (or CsPbI3 NCs) using Cs-oleate (or FA-oleate).
(b) PL spectra before and after anion exchange of FAPbI3 NCs using OAm+Br– (or OAm+I–) showing the possibility of tuning the band
gap from 570 to 780 nm.

Light-Emitting Diodes
High PL QYs and the thermodynamic
stability of colloidal FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs motivated us to investigate their potential
use in electroluminescent devices. As illustrated in Figure 7a (additional details are provided
in the Materials and Methods section), LEDs
were fabricated by sequentially spin coating a 35 nm hole-transporting
layer of PEDOT:PSS and an ∼30 nm emissive layer of colloidal
FAPbI3 (or FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3) NCs. Subsequently, a 35 nm layer of TPBi, an electron-transporting
layer (ETL), was thermally evaporated under vacuum (1 × 10–7 mbar). Finally, a 1 nm electron injection layer of
LiF and a 100 nm Al cathode layer were deposited using a patterned
shadow mask. All devices were tested under ambient conditions. As
shown in Figure 7b,
a near-IR electroluminescence (EL) emission peak was observed at 772
nm when using FAPbI3 NCs, which was consistent with the
PL emission peak. The current density versus voltage
(J–V) and radiance versus voltage characteristics are shown in Figure 7c. A radiance of 1.54 W sr–1 m–2 was realized at a driving voltage
of 5.5 V. A relatively low radiance resulted from the reduced carrier
transport in the electron/hole transport layers,159 which is a problem that could be mitigated in the future
by engineering the surfaces of the NCs. Suboptimal charge transport
was also reflected at the high turn-on voltages of the devices (≥4.0
V). An EQE of 2.3% at a current density of 0.67 mA cm–2 was determined for LEDs comprising FAPbI3 NCs (Figure 7d). Notably, such
an EQE represents the highest value among all perovskite NC-based
perovskite LEDs demonstrated in the near-IR range (>750 nm). The
highest
recently reported EQE values for perovskite NC-based devices in the
red region are 6.3% for CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs (650 nm)30 and 5.7% for CsPbI3 NCs (698 nm).97 When using FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs as an active layer, a similar device architecture yielded
an EL peak at 692 nm (Figure 7b). The photograph of the corresponding large-area (∼1.5
cm2) deep-red LED device is presented in the inset of Figure 7b. The resulting
device exhibited the highest EQE of 0.12% and a maximum luminance
of 4.3 cd/m2 (Figure S7). Although
these results are preliminary, we believe that further optimizations,
such as the introduction of metal-oxide carrier transporting layers27,160 in the device architecture, along with NC surface engineering would
eventually lead to higher EQE values.

Amplified Spontaneous Emissions
Lead halide perovskites
have been intensely investigated regarding their ability to act as
optical gain materials, particularly as thin films,34,162,163 NCs,36,49,164 and nanowires.35,147,165 Most reports point to rather
low lasing thresholds, particularly when comparing colloidal quantum
dots or organic emitters. Due to thermodynamic instability of CsPbI3, a particularly persistent challenge for small iodide-based
CsPbX3 NCs (X = Br/I, I) is how to obtain ASEs in the red
region,36 which is discussed in detail
in the introduction section. The ASE thresholds for CsPbBr3–xIx increase while the
ratio of I–/Br– (i.e., with red shift) increases under the same testing conditions used
in our laboratory, and no ASE could be obtained beyond 630 nm (at
RT). Having robust infrared NC emitters with low-threshold ASEs would
be highly advantageous because colloidal NCs could be uniformly coated
on nearly any substrate for engineering resonators and various lasing
modes. The increased stabilities of FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs allow us to observe ASEs at RT
in compact NC films (100 fs pulsed excitation) deposited on glass
substrates (Figure 8). ASEs appear as a narrow band (fwhm of 10–12 nm) red-shifted
with respect to the PL maxima (by 30 and 50 nm for FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 and FAPbI3, respectively).
Films of FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs dried
at 50 °C exhibited ASE thresholds at approximately 28 μJ
cm–2. For the drop-casted films, the ASE thresholds
decreased under the processing conditions that favored sintering of
the perovskite NCs (partial ligand desorption by repetitive washing
steps and/or annealing of the films at 90 °C). For instance,
when the FAPbI3 films were annealed at 100 °C, their
ASE thresholds decreased from 0.5 mJ cm–2 to 24
μJ cm–2. Even lower ASE thresholds were obtained
for 100 nm compact films with smooth mirror-like surfaces that were
obtained by repetitive dip-coating (with 90 °C annealing after
each dip). The resulting ASE threshold of 7.5 μJ cm–2 was among the lowest values of the red-to-near-IR emitting perovskites
(5–10 μJ cm–2).36,147,166−169

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs that exhibit
stable and highly efficient near-IR (780 nm) and red emissions (680
nm), respectively. Simple ligand-assisted synthesis procedures were
used that yielded stable colloids with consistent sizes (10–15
nm) and near-cubic shapes. Using synchrotron X-ray scattering, we
observed a locally disordered cubic lattice for FAPbI3 NCs
and a γ-orthorhombic structure for FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs. Satisfactory chemical durability of these NCs
was illustrated by the retention of high QYs (>70%) for months
by
the successful fabrication of LEDs, with EQEs reaching 2.3%, and by
the low-threshold lasing from the compact films of these NCs. Future
studies of these NCs should focus on their compositional engineering
(i.e., the formation of Cs1–xFAxPbBryI3–y) and the optimization
of LED devices. Applications in photovoltaics can be envisaged, wherein
such NC colloids can be employed as inks for deposition of absorbing
layers. In this context, and in contrast with conventional molecular
solutions used as inks, remarkable possibilities can be conceived
from facile compositional engineering, ligand removal combined with
low-temperature sintering for recrystallization, or other methods
of surface coating for maintaining quantum-size effects.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of the Formamidinium
Oleate (FA-Oleate) Precursor
Solution (∼0.25 M of FA+)
Formamidinium
acetate (FA-acetate, 0.521 g, 5 mmol, Aldrich, 99%), ODE (16 mL, Aldrich,
90%, vacuum-dried at 120 °C), and OA (11.3 mmol, 4 mL, Aldrich,
90%) were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was degassed
for 10 min at RT and then heated under nitrogen to 130 °C, which
yielded a clear solution. This solution was dried for 30 min at 50
°C under vacuum. FA-oleate needs to be heated to 100 °C
under nitrogen before use because it often precipitates when stored
at cold RT.

Synthesis of the Cesium-Oleate Precursor
(∼0.06 M of
Cs+)
Cs2CO3 (0.433 g, 1.33
mmol, Aldrich, 99%), ODE (20 mL), and OA (1.25 mL, 3.53 mmol) were
mixed in a 50 mL round-bottom flask, dried for 1 h at 120 °C,
and heated to 150 °C until the solution became clear. Cs-oleate
was heated to 100 °C before use because it often precipitates
when cooled to RT.

Preparation of Oleylammonium Halide (OAmX,
X = Br, I)
Ethanol (100 mL, Aldrich, absolute, > 99.8%)
and OLA (12.5 mL, Acros
Organics, 80–90%) were combined in a 250 mL two-neck flask
and vigorously stirred. The reaction mixture was cooled in an ice–water
bath before adding HBr (8.56 mL, 8% aqueous solution, Aldrich) or
HI (10 mL, 57% aqueous solution, Aldrich, without stabilizer) dropwise
to yield a final OLA:HX molar ratio of 1:2. The mixture was left to
react overnight under flowing N2. Next, the solution was
dried under vacuum, and the obtained product was recrystallized multiple
times from diethyl ether and then isolated as a white powder by vacuum-drying
at 80 °C.

Synthesis of FAPbI3 NCs via the
Two-Precursor Method (Method 1)
PbI2 (0.086 g,
0.187 mmol, Aldrich, 99%) and ODE (5 mL) were added to a 25 mL round-bottom
flask, dried for 1 h at 120 °C, and mixed with OA (1 mL, vacuum-dried
at 120 °C) and OLA (0.5 mL, vacuum-dried at 120 °C). When
the PbI2 was fully dissolved and the mixture was cooled
to 80 °C, the preheated FA-oleate precursor (2 mL, yielding a
molar ratio FA:Pb = 2.7) was injected. After 10–60 s of stirring,
the solution was cooled to RT in a water bath. The crude solution
was centrifuged for 5 min at 12 100 rpm, the supernatant solution
was discarded, and the precipitate was redispersed in toluene. Next,
NCs were subjected to two cycles of precipitation and redispersion
by adding acetonitrile (volume ratio of toluene:acetonitrile = 3:1)
to destabilize the colloids, followed by centrifuging and dispersing
the NCs in toluene again. In an alternative purification procedure,
the supernatant solution was discarded after centrifuging the crude
solution for 5 min at 12 100 rpm, and the precipitate was dispersed
in 400 μL of hexane and centrifuged again. The precipitate was
suspended in 6 mL of toluene and centrifuged at 4400 rpm for 3 min.
Next, the precipitate was discarded and the supernatant solution was
used for further experiments.

Synthesis of FAPbI3 NCs via the
Three-Precursor Method (Method 2)
Pb(acetate)2·3H2O (0.076 g, 0.2 mmol, Aldrich, 99.99%), FA-acetate
(0.078 g, 0.75 mmol), ODE (8 mL, dried), and OA (2 mL, dried) were
combined in a 25 mL three-neck flask and dried under vacuum for 30
min at 50 °C. The mixture was heated to 80 °C under N2, followed by the injection of OAmI (0.237 g, 0.6 mmol in
2 mL of toluene). After 10 s, the reaction mixture was cooled in the
water bath. The crude solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 12 100
rpm, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was redispersed
in toluene and washed two times with acetonitrile (3:1 toluene/acetonitrile).

Synthesis of FA-Doped CsPbI3 NCs
PbI2 (0.086 g, 0.187 mmol) and ODE (5 mL) were added to a 25 mL
round-bottom flask. The resulting suspension was dried for 1 h at
120 °C. Under nitrogen, OA (1 mL, dried) and 0.5 mL of predried
OLA were added. When the PbI2 dissolved, the mixture was
heated to 165 °C. A preheated precursor solution consisting of
FA-oleate (0.27 mL) and Cs-oleate (0.27 mL) was injected and then
cooled to RT in a water bath after 1 min of stirring. NCs were isolated
and purified as described for FAPbI3 NCs.

Anion Exchange
Anion-exchange reactions were performed
in 1 mL of toluene and OAmBr (concentrations from 1 to 10 mg/mL) by
adding 200 μL of the FAPbI3 NCs (10 mg/mL) and then
stirring the mixture for 10 min at RT. The NCs were isolated by adding
0.4 mL of acetonitrile followed by centrifugation and redispersion
in toluene.

Cation Exchange
The cation-exchange
reactions were
performed in 1 mL of toluene solution containing Cs-oleate or FA-oleate,
which were prepared by diluting 50–500 μL of the Cs-oleate
or FA-oleate precursors as described above with toluene. FAPbI3 NCs (10 mg/mL) or CsPbI3 NCs were added, and the
mixture was stirred for 10 min at RT. The NCs were isolated by adding
0.4 mL of acetonitrile followed by centrifugation and redispersion
in toluene.

Preparation of Films by Dip-Coating
Next, 200 μL
of acetonitrile was added to 1 mL of the as-synthesized FAPbI3 NCs dispersion and centrifuged for 3 min. Then, the precipitate
was dispersed in 1 mL of toluene. This purification process was repeated
three more times. The final dispersion solution was passed through
a 0.45 μm PTFE filter, and an additional 2 mL of toluene was
added to give an approximate NC concentration of 1 mg/mL. Thin films
were prepared on acetone-cleaned glass slides by withdrawing the slide
from the dispersed and washed FAPbI3 NCs at a rate of 10
mm min–1 and then baking the slide at 90 °C
for 10 min. Next, the slide was cooled to RT and immersed in pure
toluene before slowly withdrawing it again (10 mm min–1) and drying it at 90 °C for 1 min. This sequence was repeated
10 times to yield a film with a thickness of approximately 100 nm.
The thickness of the film was measured using a Dektak XT Bruker with
Bruker Vision 64, version 5.51 software.

Fabrication of LED Devices
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated
glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω/□ were
purchased from Lumtech Corp. The hole injection material poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) was purchased from Heraeus (Clevios P VPCH 8000). The
electron transport material 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl)tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) was supplied by e-Ray Optoelectronic.
The electron injection material lithium fluoride (LiF) was purchased
from Acros Organics, and aluminum (Al) pellets were purchased from
Kurt J. Lesker Co. Ltd. All the materials were used without any further
purification.

First, patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were
rinsed with a mixture of Extran MA02 neutral detergent and deionized
(DI) water (1:3). Subsequently, substrates were sonicated in DI water,
acetone, and 2-propanol for 10 min each. Then, the substrates were
treated in an oxygen plasma for 10 min. The aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS
was spin-coated on the precleaned ITO glass at a speed of 4000 rpm
for 20 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 30 min under ambient
conditions. All of the annealed substrates were transferred into a
nitrogen-filled glovebox for the deposition of subsequent layers.
The colloidal suspension of FAPbI3 NCs in toluene (10 mg/mL)
was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 20 s. Then, the ETL was deposited
by the thermal evaporation of TPBi in a vacuum chamber at ∼1
× 10–7 mbar. Finally, a 1 nm LiF electron injection
layer and a 100 nm Al cathode layer were deposited through the shadow
mask. Each substrate is patterned to realize four devices, each with
an active area of 15 mm2. Before measurements, all devices
were stored in the glovebox and tested under the ambient atmosphere
without encapsulation.

LED Performance Characterization
A Keithley 2400 source
meter was used to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The EL spectra
were recorded through an optical fiber by using a calibrated LR1 compact
spectrometer (ASEQ Instruments) with thermoelectric cooling and a
spectral range of 300 to 1000 nm. A spectroradiometer (Photoresearch
PR-655) was used to calibrate the LR1 spectrometer. The photon flux
was measured using an optical power meter (PM12 VA from Thorlabs)
with a calibrated silicon photodiode detector. The EQE was calculated
as the total number of emitted photons divided by the total number
of injected electrons by assuming a Lambertian emission profile.

UV–Vis Absorbance
Spectra were recorded with
a Jasco V670 spectrometer in transmission mode.

Steady-State
Photoluminescence
PL spectra were collected
using a Fluorolog iHR 320 Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrometer equipped
with a PMT detector. The PL QYs of the colloidal hexane solutions
were determined using standard procedures. The following dye molecules
were used as references: HITCI for FAPbI3 NCs and oxazine
1 for (FA/Cs)PbI3 NCs (Figure S8).170,171

Time-Resolved Photoluminescence
These measurements
were performed using a time-correlated single photon counting system
equipped with the SPC-130-EM counting module (Becker & Hickl GmbH)
and an IDQ-ID-100-20-ULN avalanche photodiode (Quantique) for recording
the decay traces. Emissions from the perovskite NCs were excited by
using a BDL-488-SMN laser (Becker & Hickl) with a pulse duration
of 50 ps, a wavelength of 488 nm, and a CW power equivalent of ∼0.5
mW and were externally triggered at a repetition rate of 1 MHz. PL
emissions from the samples were passed through a long-pass optical
filter with an edge at 500 nm to reject the excitation laser line.

Photoluminescence Quantum Yield (PL QY) Measurements of Films
The method used to measure the absolute value of the PL QY was
similar to the method used by Semonin etal.172 An integrating sphere
(IS200-4, Thorlabs) with a short-pass filter (FES450, Thorlabs) was
used, the absorbance was corrected to the reflectance, and the scattering
losses were estimated. A CW laser diode with a wavelength of 405 nm
and a power of 0.2 W modulated at 30 Hz was used as the excitation
source. The amounts of emitted light were measured using long-pass
filters (FEL450, Thorlabs). The light intensity was measured using
a broadband (0.1–20 μm) UM9B-BL-DA pyroelectric photodetector
(Gentec-EO). The modulated signal from the detector was recovered
by using a lock-in amplifier (SR 850, Stanford Research). The ratio
between the emitted and absorbed light gives the energy yield. The
PL QY was obtained from the value of an energy yield and corrected
to the ratio of the photon energies of the laser beam and PL bands.

Amplified Spontaneous Emission
ASE measurements were
performed using excitation from a femtosecond laser system consisting
of an oscillator (Vitesse 800) and an amplifier (Legend Elite), which
were both from Coherent Inc., and a frequency-doubling external BBO
crystal that yielded 100 fs pulses at 400 nm, a repetition rate of
1 kHz, and a pulse energy of up to 4 μJ. The laser beam profile
had a TEM00 mode with a fwhm of 1.5 mm. The laser power was measured
by using a LabMax-TOP laser energy meter (Coherent Inc.) with a nJ
measuring head. The optical emissions were recorded by using the LR1-T
CCD spectrometer of the ASEQ-instrument (1 nm spectral resolution).
The laser beam intensity profiles were determined by using a LabMax-TOP
camera from Coherent Inc.

Powder X-ray Diffraction Patterns
XRD was recorded
using a powder diffractometer (STOE STADI P) with Cu Kα1 radiation. The diffractometer was operated in transmission
mode and included a germanium monochromator and a silicon strip detector
(Dectris Mythen).

Synchrotron X-ray Total Scattering Measurements
Colloidal
suspensions of FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 were loaded into 0.8-mm-diameter certified borosilicate
glass capillaries. Synchrotron X-ray total scattering measurements
were conducted at the X04SA-MS4 Powder Diffraction Beamline of the
Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland).151 The operational beam energy was set at 22 keV
(λ = 0.565 483 Å) and was accurately determined
using a silicon powder standard (NIST 640d, a0 = 0.543123(8) nm at 22.5 °C). Data were collected from
0.5° to 130° 2θ using a single-photon counting silicon
microstrip detector (MYTHEN II).173 Using
a He/air background, the scattering patterns of the empty glass capillary
tubes and pure solvent were independently collected under the same
experimental conditions and then subtracted from the sample signals.
The transmission coefficients of the sample and solvent-loaded capillaries
were also measured and used for the angle-dependent absorption correction.
Instead of being subtracted, the inelastic Compton scattering was
added as an additional model component during the data analysis. For
the DFA, the 3–100° angular range was used.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM images were recorded
using a JEOL JEM-2200FS microscope operated at 200 kV.

Rutherford
Backscattering Spectrometry
RBS was conducted
at the ETH Laboratory for Ion Beam Physics by using a 2 MeV 4He beam and a silicon PIN diode detector at 168°. The resulting
data were evaluated by using the RUMP code.174

Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
EDX was performed
using a Zeiss Gemini 1530/Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope.
