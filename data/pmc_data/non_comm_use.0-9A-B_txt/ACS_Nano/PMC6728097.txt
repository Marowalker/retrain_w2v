Superparamagnetism
exists only in nanocrystals, and to endow micro/macro-materials with
superparamagnetism, superparamagnetic nanoparticles have to be assembled
into complex materials. Most techniques currently used to produce
such assemblies are inefficient in terms of time and material. Herein,
we used evaporation-guided assembly to produce superparamagnetic supraparticles
by drying ferrofluid droplets on a superamphiphobic substrate in the
presence of an external magnetic field. By tuning the concentration
of ferrofluid droplets and controlling the magnetic field, barrel-like,
cone-like, and two-tower-like supraparticles were obtained. These
assembled supraparticles preserved the superparamagnetism of the original
nanoparticles. Moreover, other colloids can easily be integrated into
the ferrofluid suspension to produce, by co-assembly, anisotropic
binary supraparticles with additional functions. Additionally, the
magnetic and anisotropic nature of the resulting supraparticles was
harnessed to prepare magnetically actuable microswimmers.

Superparamagnetic
materials display high magnetization only in the presence of a magnetic
field, and they do not retain any magnetization once the magnetic
field is removed.1,2 This reversible magnetization
allows the manipulation of the superparamagnetic materials by applying
magnetic fields, resulting in numerous attractive applications such
as microactuators,3−5 magnetic separation,6−8 and drug delivery.9−11 However, superparamagnetism is strongly size dependent and only
exists in nanocrystals. In the case of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs),
superparamagnetism is mostly observed in particles with a diameter
smaller than ca. 30 nm.12,13

To build micro/macro-size superparamagnetic materials for
further applications, superparamagnetic NPs have to be assembled into
more complex hierarchical structures.12,14 However, following
aggregation and clustering, the magnetization and the coercitivity
of the material could change,15−20 and new magnetic response could be observed.21,22 Therefore, the controlled assembly of superparamagnetic NPs is required.
Such structures have been prepared by the direct formation of 1D arrays23,24 or by the formation of controlled hybrid clustered beads.12,25,26 Those clustered-beads can themselves
undergo further assembly leading to the formation of more complex
structures, that is, necklace-like chains.18,27,28

In comparison to those simples structures,
three-dimensional (3D)-structured magneto-responsive materials, especially
materials with an anisotropic magnetic response, would display an
even larger array of potential applications such as flexible integrated
sensors29,30 or biomimetic soft-robots.31,32 In order to obtain 3D-structured magneto-responsive materials, techniques
such as self-assembly33−35 and lithography36−38 have been used. For
example, the self-assembly of magnetite nanocubes into helical superstructure
was realized by solvent evaporation at the liquid–air interface
in the presence of an external magnetic field.33 Similarly, lithography has been used to prepare complex
3D structures containing iron oxide NPs. For example, iron oxide NPs
embedded in a monomer solution were used to produce superparamagnetic
3D-structured microrobots with a helical shape. These helical microrobots
were able to mimic bacterial movements and swim under remote magnetic
guidance in flows with low Reynolds numbers, for example, in blood.39−41 Even though those processing methods have shown a range of potential
applications for 3D-structured magneto-responsive materials, they
still suffer from limited scalability and heavy use of non-ecofriendly
conditions.

Recently, evaporation-guided colloidal assembly
has been proposed as an efficient method for the preparation of 3D
mesoscopic NP assemblies.42,43 In this approach, droplets
of NP suspension were dried on liquid-repellent surfaces to form supraparticles.42−44 After evaporation-guided assembly, the fabricated supraparticles
can be easily collected without a further processing step which prevents
the use of toxic solvents.42 Moreover,
various sizes and shapes of supraparticles can be obtained. By tuning
the concentration of the suspension and the volume of the drops, the
size of the supraparticles can be varied from several microns to several
millimeters. Supraparticles with various shapes, such as hemispherical,45 doughnut-like,46 and
boat-like,47,48 have been fabricated with the
simple control of the wettability of the colloidal suspension on the
substrates. Additionally, the composition of supraparticles can be
varied by changing or mixing different types of colloids.43 For example, suspensions of iron-nickel alloy
particles were mixed into droplets of silica NPs and led to the formation
of patchy supraparticles.46

An alternative
method for the formation of large 3D superparamagnetic structures
is to make use of the natural properties of ferrofluids. Colloidal
suspensions of magnetic NPs, known as ferrofluid, can form a variety
of transient structures when placed in a magnetic field. Ferrofluids
produce reversible structures under the guidance of a magnetic field,
such as Rosensweig pattern49 or separated
cone-like microdroplets when placed on non-wetting solid surfaces.50 However, those patterns have never been used
to purposely template solid materials.

Here, a suspension of
hybrid Fe3O4/polystyrene nanoparticles (mgPS
NPs) (SI, Figure S2) stabilized with sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ([SDS] = 0.4 g/L, surface tension (γ)
= 49 ± 1 mN/m) was dried in the presence of a magnetic field
on a superamphiphobic surface (Figure 1a) to trap the transient shape of the suspension droplets
during evaporation. By controlling the magnetic strength, magnetic
orientation, and the initial concentration of NPs, supraparticles
with distinct anisotropic shapes were obtained.

Results and Discussion
The final shape of supraparticles
obtained by drying droplets of a magnetic colloidal suspension can
be influenced by two main factors: the magnetization of the superparamagnetic
NP dispersion and the surface and interfacial forces. The use of superamphiphobic
substrates, which minimized the wetting of the droplet, was crucial
to obtain 3D supraparticles. When, instead, only hydrophobic substrates
were used, film-like structures were observed due to the strong pinning
effect caused by the more important wetting of the substrate by the
colloidal suspension (SI, Figure S5).

To fully understand the effect of the presence of a magnetic field
on the supraparticles formation, the drying process of superparamagnetic
NPs suspensions with and without magnetic field was observed under
the same drying conditions (Figure 1b–d). Figure 1b shows that in the absence of a magnetic field, the
spherical droplet shrunk symmetrically as a consequence of water evaporation.
After 35 min, the shape of the droplet changed through a buckling
mechanism, that is, after reaching a critical composition, a sudden
deformation of the droplet occurred. The resulting anisotropic structure,
shaped like a deflating ball, subsequently shrunk further without
notable alteration in its shape during the final part of the drying
process. (Figure 1b
and Video S1, SI). This buckling behavior
was caused by the non-uniform distribution of mgPS NPs and surfactant
molecules within the droplet. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
was used to analyze the distribution of surfactant and mgPS NP across
the volume of the supraparticle (SI, Figure S6). The local concentrations of sulfur and iron were used as respective
indicators for the distribution of surfactant and mgPS NPs (SI, Table S1). The results show that the surface
of the supraparticles was enriched in surfactant in comparison to
the bulk which was richer in mgPS NPs. During the evaporation, the
concentration of NPs and surfactants at the air/water interface increased,
leading to the formation of a shell. As the amount of water in the
droplet kept decreasing, a mechanical stress built up in the shell.
To release this stress, the shell rapidly deformed, and the droplet
buckled. As a result, the contact line remained constant, while the
surface of the drop wrinkled (Figure 1c). This buckling behavior was similar to what has
been previously observed for suspension of silica or polystyrene NPs
dried on superhydrophobic surfaces,46,47 and reminiscent
of what has been observed during spray drying of microdroplets of
colloidal suspensions.51

In the presence
of a magnetic field of 16 kA/m, the initial contact line was larger
than that observed without magnetic field since the magnetic attractive
force is driving the NPs to partially segregate at the bottom of the
droplet. Initially, the volume of the droplet decreased symmetrically
by evaporation, preserving the original aspect ratio. However, after
30–40 min, the aspect ratio of the droplet started to change;
the droplet became narrower and more elongated (SI, Figure S13). Over the following 2–10 min, as the concentration
of mgPS NPs increased due to the evaporation of water, the height
of the droplet quickly increased, and the droplet formed a cone-like
structure. After this point, the shape and aspect ratio of the supraparticles
were preserved until evaporation of the remaining water. Ultimately,
the final shape of the supraparticle was reached and preserved after ca. 45 min (Figure 1d and Video S2, SI).

In ferrofluids
suspensions, Rosensweig instabilities are formed only when the magnetization
(M) of the suspension exceeds a critical magnetization
(Mc) defined by the surface tension (γ)
of the suspension as49 1  where μ and μ0 are the magnetic
permeability of the ferrofluid suspension and of the vacuum, respectively,
and g and ρ are the gravitational constant
and the density of the ferrofluid suspension. Initially, Figure 1b shows that there
are no differences in the shape of the droplets dried at 0 and 16
kA/m. However, as the system dried, the magnetization of the droplet
of mgPS suspension crossed the Mc threshold,
and the droplet deformed leading to the formation of a conical supraparticle.
The magnetization of the mgPS suspension was influenced by several
factors. The net magnetization of mgPS NPs changes with the applied
magnetic field (H) (SI, Figure S2c) and is described by49 2  where χ is the volume magnetic susceptibility
of the material. Furthermore, the magnetization (M) of the ferrofluid suspension depends on the NP concentration, as
it is proportional to the volume fraction of superparamagnetic material
in the suspension. According to the Rosensweig theory:49,52 3  where VFe3O4NPs is the volume
of iron oxide NPs and Vdroplet is the
volume of the droplet. Thus, the magnetization of the suspension depends
both on the initial concentration of mgPS in suspension and on the
amount of water that has evaporated. As the suspension dried, the
concentration increased, and at some point during the process, the
magnetization of the droplet surpassed Mc, and the droplet started to elongate as evidenced by the increase
in the aspect ratio of the droplet (SI, Figure S13).

The results obtained suggest that the shape adopted
by the ferrofluid droplets, and ultimately by the supraparticles,
was strongly influenced by the magnetization of the droplets. Consequently,
the initial concentration of NPs (cNP)
in the ferrofluid droplet and the applied magnetic field were varied
to investigate the relationship between the final shape of the supraparticle
and conditions under which drying was performed.

The initial cNP was varied from 0.3 wt % to 30 wt %, and
the droplets were dried in a magnetic field of 16 kA/m. The initial
contact angle decreased and the initial contact line increased with
increasing cNP, since at higher concentration,
a larger number of NPs were dragged to the interface between the droplet
and the substrate. This led to an increase in the apparent wetting
of the surface by the suspension, characterized by a lower contact
angle and higher contact line (Figure 2a).

The drying of suspensions with
different cNP resulted in the formation
of supraparticles with distinct shapes. In a magnetic field of 16
kA/m, two populations of supraparticles were observed: cone-like structures
at low cNP (≤6 wt %) and barrel-like
structures at high cNP (Figure 2b). The cones were partially
empty; a cavity was formed at the interface between the droplet and
the superamphiphobic surface (SI, Figure S7). The formation of this cavity can be attributed to a buckling effect
directed by the magnetic field and the presence of the superamphiphobic
surface. Particle jamming created by the combined effect of solvent
evaporation and magnetic field led to the formation of a stiff layer
of particles at the droplet/surface interface, when this layer was
unable to shrink further, buckling happened to create the cavity.

Conversely, suspensions with high cNP (≥12 wt %) resulted in supraparticles with barrel-like structures.
The inner part was completely empty and was opened from top-to-bottom;
the result of the combined effect of the buckling and dewetting (SI, Figure S8). Figure 2c shows that, initially, the ferrofluid droplet
was spherical and shrunk symmetrically during the water evaporation.
Then the aspect ratio of the droplet started to increase, which is
similar to what was observed for lower cNP leading to the formation of a conical droplet (SI, Figure S13). Afterward, the height of the conical ferrofluid
droplet increased until it reached a critical point where buckling
happened, resulting in the formation of a barrel-like structure within
minutes (Video S3, SI). This buckling effect
was also observable in the variation of the contact line over time
(Figure 2d). The buckling
happened where a strong discontinuity was monitored toward the end
of the drying process. For example, during the drying of a suspension
with cNP= 21 wt % in a magnetic field
of 16 kA/m, the contact line decreased during the first 25 min. Then,
the contact line and the width of the droplet remained constant for ca. 5 min, and only the height of the droplet decreased
until the droplet buckled. Following the buckling of the droplet,
a rapid decrease in the contact line was observed, and the final barrel-like
supraparticle was obtained. The barrel like-structure is the stretched
version of toroids formed with non-magnetic suspension drops.46

To investigate further the influence of
the strength of the magnetic field, we conducted a series of experiments
at 80 and 160 kA/m. The results observed at 80 kA/m (SI, Figure S11) were similar to those observed at
16 kA/m. However, the behavior of the suspension drying in a magnetic
field of 160kA/m showed marked differences due to the higher magnetization
of the suspension. Similar to the behavior observed in H = 16 kA/m, the contact line of the droplets increased with increasing cNP, but, in every case, the contact line at
160 kA/m was larger than at 16 kA/m. In a field of 160 kA/m, especially
at higher cNP, the effect of the strong
field led to an increase of the contact line of the droplets on the
surface (Figure 2e),
since the magnetic attraction forces acting on the NPs were stronger
and dragged the mgPS NPs to the substrate, increasing the apparent
wetting of the superamphiphobic surface.

In a magnetic field
of H = 160 kA/m, two different types of shapes, either
cone-like structures or two-tower-like structures (Figure 2f), were observed. Similar
to what was observed with H = 16 kA/m, lower cNP (≤12 wt %) led to the formation of
empty cone-like structures (SI, Figure S7). However, at higher cNP (≥21
wt %), the NPs formed two-tower-like structures instead of barrel-like
shapes. At high H and high cNP, the ferrofluid droplets did not buckle into a barrel-like
structure, but rather split into two cone-like shapes during evaporation
(Figure 2g and Video S4, SI). This splitting effect was observed
in the variation of the contact line over time (SI, Figure S9). For example, during the drying of a suspension
with cNP = 30 wt % in a magnetic field
of 160 kA/m, the contact line first decreased for ca. 25 min. Then the contact line remained constant, and during that
time, the top part of the droplet split into two separated fractions
(SI, Video S4).

This behavior was
similar to what has been observed for the splitting of ferrofluid
droplets on superhydrophobic substrates under variable magnetic fields.50 It is known that ferrofluid drops can spontaneously
split into several smaller droplets when the drop size (contact line
of the droplet) is larger than a critical wavelength (λc):50 4  where H is the total magnetic field intensity, M is the magnetization of the drop, and d/dz is the change in z-direction (normal
to the surface). In the present case, the splitting phenomenon was
more complex, because during evaporation, both γ and M are changing since those parameters are concentration
dependent. During the drying of the droplets, the change of γ
was moderate and similar for all samples with different cNP because the initial concentration of surfactant molecules
was the same in all samples. However, the change of magnetization
over time, M(t), was not the same
at every cNP. As the water evaporated, Vdroplet decreased over time resulting in an increase of
the magnetization during drying, which finally led to a decrease in
λc. Consequently, even if, initially, at high cNP the system was below the λc, droplet splitting could be observed during the drying process as
the concentration and, consequently, the magnetization increased.
The critical concentration where the magnetization was large enough
to induce a splitting of the droplet was reached after ca. 30 min at 21 wt % and after 26 min at 30 wt % (SI, Figure S9) when the concentration of mgPS NPs
in suspension reached ca. 50 wt %.

The relation
between the size of the contact line and the splitting of the droplet
was also corroborated by using droplets of different volume with cNP= 21 wt % (SI, Figure S10). During the drying kinetics, droplets of different volumes
have the same magnetization and surface tension, but the contact line
decreased with the initial volume of the droplet while λc stayed constant. Thus, smaller droplets, having smaller initial
contact lines, did not experience splitting because the contact line
remained constantly smaller than λc.

Figure 3a summarizes the
diversity of supraparticle shapes obtained by mapping the structures
obtained as a function of the initial NPs concentrations and applied
magnetic fields. Four different shapes were obtained for the resulting
supraparticles: deflated ball, cone, barrel, and two-tower. Other
factors such as the drying speed or the total volume of droplet also
influences the final shape of supraparticles. For example, by drying
the 21 wt % droplets with different volumes, cone and two-tower-like
shapes could be obtained (SI, Figure S10). The difference in the final structure adopted by the drying droplet
depended on the complex balance of forces present in the system, where
wetting, buckling, and magnetization influenced, through different
mechanisms, the final structure observed. Gravitational forces can
also have an effect, however, it is not expected to play an important
role here since the gravitational forces were significantly smaller
than magnetization.53 As shown in the structure
map, the overall shapes of supraparticles were mainly influenced by
the magnetization. Although the wetting of the surface by the droplet
was minimized by using superamphiphobic surfaces, wetting forces were
responsible for the buckling and the formation of hollow structures.
The shapes of the supraparticles can be adjusted by changing the direction
of the applied magnetic field during the drying process. When the
direction of the magnetic field was changed from 90° to 60°,
the resulting supraparticles showed similar structures but have different
orientation following the directions of the magnetic field (Figure 3b).

the supraparticles obtained with the variation of the magnetic strength
and initial concentration of ferrofluid. The regime in gray, red,
blue, and green indicates supraparticle with deflated ball, cone,
barrel, two-tower shape, respectively. These supraparticles were obtained
by drying of 5 μL NPs suspension. b) Two-tower shape supraparticles

both were under a magnetic field of 160 kA/m). (c) Microscopic images

weight fraction of mgPS NPs. (e) Binary supraparticles fabricated
by drying a cosuspension of mgPS NPs with titanium dioxide NPs (TiO2 /mgPS, upper panel) or polystyrene NPs (PS/mgPS, bottom panel).
The weight fraction of mgPS NPS was varied from 0%, 50%, 83% to 91%.
The total initial NPs concentration remained constant at 6 wt %, and
the magnetic field was 160 kA/m. Scale bars are 0.5 mm.

Similarly, a variety of supraparticles with various
structures can be obtained when using a suspension of ferromagnetic
NPs (Figure 3c and
SI, Figure S14) instead of a suspension
of superparamagnetic mgPS NPs. As shown in Figure 3c, the supraparticles with a cone-like structure
were obtained by drying the ferromagnetic suspension (from 1% to 20%)
in the presence of a magnetic field (160 kA/m).

Furthermore,
complex heterostructures can be prepared by drying a cosuspension
of mgPS NPs and other NPs.46,54 For example, cone-shape
supraparticles were prepared by drying a mixture of TiO2 NPs and mgPS NPs (Figure 3d–e). Similarly, anisotropic supraparticles were also
obtained when mgPS NPs were mixed with pure polystyrene NPs. In both
cases, the mgPS NPs drove the droplet to form anisotropic supraparticles
(aspect ratio >1) when the fraction of mgPS NPs in a cosuspension
was above a threshold (75%) to actively act as a templating agent.
Since the magnetization of the droplet is a function of the concentration
of magnetic iron oxide in the droplet, as the ratio of non-magnetic
particles increased, the shape selectivity was lost. When the concentration
of mgPS in the NP cosuspension decreased below 50 wt % of the solid
content, then the critical magnetization (Mc) needed to trigger the formation anisotropic structures cannot be
reached, and spherical supraparticles were obtained. When the loading
of mgPS was larger than this threshold composition, a magnetically
induced deformation of the supraparticle was observed. However, segregation
of the different NPs was observed in the final structures (SI, Figure S16). The mgPS NPs segregated in the regions
where the magnetic field was the strongest. The formation of supraparticles
by the evaporation of cosuspension droplets shows the flexibility
of magnetic templating to form complex supraparticles with different
architectures, chemical compositions, and functions.

The anisotropic
supraparticles obtained by drying mgPS NPs preserved the superparamagnetism
of the building blocks. The saturated magnetization of mgPS NPs and
supraparticles was 55 Am2/kg and 52 Am2/kg,
respectively (Figure 4a). Thus, their magneto-responsive behavior could be harnessed to
magnetically control the supraparticles. Figure 4b shows the behavior of a cone-like supraparticle
in a magnetic field acting as an active microswimmer. First, the movement
of the supraparticle in suspension in water was controlled by applying
selected magnetic fields. The trajectory of this supraparticle was
tailored by the on/off triggering the magnetic field at different
locations (Video S5, SI). The response
speed of the supraparticle was fast, immediately when the magnetic
field was turned on, the supraparticle moved and quickly stopped when
the magnetic field was removed (Figure 4c). In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the supraparticle
was propelled in the direction of increasing gradient of magnetic
field. The supraparticle not only followed the magnetic field but
also reoriented itself in response to the application of the magnetic
field (SI, Figure S17). The bottom part
of the cone-like supraparticle was always facing the magnet due to
the anisotropy of the supraparticle. Similar behavior was also observed
in a rotational magnetic field (Video S6, SI).

Conclusion
In
summary, we prepared superparamagnetic supraparticles by the evaporation-guided
assembly of ferrofluid droplets on a superamphiphobic surface in the
presence of a magnetic field. These magneto-responsive supraparticles
have well-defined structures such as deflated ball, cone, barrel,
and two-tower shapes. The final 3D architecture of the supraparticles
can be tuned by systematically varying the initial concentration of
superparamagnetic NPs and the applied magnetic field. Moreover, the
ferrofluid suspension can be used as the driving force to template
the assembly of superparamagnetic NPs cosuspension and other functional
NPs to fabricate functional anisotropic binary supraparticles. Thus,
this flexible fabrication process offers the possibility to create
anisotropic and magneto-responsive supraparticles with various materials.
Since these anisotropic supraparticles are magneto-responsive, their
orientation and motion can be spatially controlled by magnetic fields.

Methods
Superparamagnetic iron
oxide NPs (Fe3O4 NPs) with a diameter of 13
± 4 nm were synthesized by co-precipitation. The Fe3O4 NPs were then encapsulated in polystyrene by emulsion
polymerization to produce hybrid Fe3O4/polystyrene
nanoparticles (mgPS NPs) with a diameter of 110 ± 30 nm. The
mgPS NPs were washed and finally dispersed in water and stabilized
with sodium dodecyl sulfate ([SDS] = 0.4 g/L, surface tension of suspension
was 49 mN/m). The mgPS NPs were used as building blocks for the fabrication
of supraparticles. To fabricate the supraparticles, unless noted otherwise,
5 μL droplets of mgPS NPs suspension (with a concentration ranging
from 0.3 wt % to 30 wt %) were dried on a superamphiphobic surface
at a temperature of 23 °C and a humidity of 25%. The silica structured
superamphiphobic surfaces were fabricated by the soot deposition method.55 The magnetic field was generated by placing
a permanent magnet (NdFeB, 30 × 30 × 15 mm) under the superamphiphobic
surface. To obtain binary supraparticles, the titanium dioxide nanoparticles
(TiO2 NPs, 25 nm, Aldrich, Germany) and polystyrene nanoparticles
(PS NPs, 270 nm) were dispersed in distilled water and then mixed
with a concentrated suspension of mgPS NPs in order to obtain a total
NP concentration of 6 wt % with varying fraction of mgPS NPs.
