Contact
lenses are ubiquitous biomedical devices used for vision
correction and cosmetic purposes. Their application as quantitative
analytical devices is highly promising for point-of-care diagnostics.
However, it is a challenge to integrate nanoscale features into commercial
contact lenses for application in low-cost biosensors. A neodymium-doped
yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (1064 nm, 3 ns pulse, 240 mJ)
in holographic interference patterning mode was utilized to produce
optical nanostructures over the surface of a hydrogel contact lens.
One-dimensional (925 nm) and two-dimensional (925 nm × 925 nm)
nanostructures were produced on contact lenses and analyzed by spectroscopy
and angle-resolve measurements. The holographic properties of these
nanostructures were tested in ambient moisture, fully hydrated, and
artificial tear conditions. The measurements showed a rapid tuning
of optical diffraction from these nanostructures from 41 to 48°.
The nanostructures were patterned near the edges of the contact lens
to avoid any interference and obstruction to the human vision. The
formation of 2D nanostructures on lenses increased the diffraction
efficiency by more than 10%. The versatility of the holographic laser
ablation method was demonstrated by producing four different 2D nanopattern
geometries on contact lenses. Hydrophobicity of the contact lens was
characterized by contact angle measurements, which increased from
59.0° at pristine condition to 62.5° at post-nanofabrication.
The holographic nanostructures on the contact lens were used to sense
the concentration of Na+ ions. Artificial tear solution
was used to simulate the conditions in dry eye syndrome, and nanostructures
on the contact lenses were used to detect the electrolyte concentration
changes (±47 mmol L–1). Nanopatterns on a contact
lens may be used to sense other ocular diseases in early stages at
point-of-care settings.

==== Body
Ocular diseases
are associated
with increasing healthcare costs involving visual acuity tests, prescriptions
of eye drops, corrective lenses, and eye surgeries. For instance,
diabetic macular edema, which is the leading cause of blindness among
working age adults in the United Kingdom, degrades visual acuity because
of the inflammation on the central retinal thickness. This is a result
of increased intraocular pressure due to damaged blood vessels in
the retina, eventually causing vision impairment.1 Graves’ ophthalmopathy is another ocular condition
resulting in the overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism),
causing eyelid lag and retraction, leading to the deterioration of
eye muscles and cornea.2,3 Another major ocular disorder
is glaucoma, with over 60.5 million patients globally, and it is estimated
that this number will rise to 79.6 million by 2020.4 Glucoma is caused by the increase of intraocular pressure
due to the buildup of fluids, damaging the optic nerve and leading
to complete blindness in worse cases.5 Lastly,
inadequate amount of tear or oil production can cause dry eye syndrome.
It may be caused by Meibomian gland dysfunction (blockage of oil glands)
and/or lacrimal gland dysfunction (LGD, aqueous tear deficiency).
The dryness could lead to vision impairment, discomfort, and eventually
blindness. Tear electrolytes such as Na+ ion concentrations
can be used to diagnose the dry eye severity at early stages.6 Existing diagnoses of ocular vision diseases
involves testing of visual acuity and prescribing corrective lenses.7 However, there is a clear lack of quantitative
point-of-care diagnostics to aid ophthalmologists. It is highly desirable
to build a platform on existing commercial contact lenses to create
functionalities, such as sensing biomarkers and physical changes in
the eye.

Commercial silicon–hydrogel contact lenses are
widely used
to correct common vision problems. They are made from a variety of
hydrogel compounds with different compositions, but all of them have
high water content to interact with the tear film.8 Tears have substantial diagnostic information regarding
ocular diseases, and they can be used as a surrogate medium for analyzing
blood chemistry.6,10 Recently, an optical fiber sensor
attached on a contact lens was developed for the quantification of
tear electrolytes.11 Various nanostructures
have been fabricated within hydrogels that act as optical transducers.9 However, integrating nanoscale features into
hydrogel structures represents a fundamental challenge for producing
functional contact lenses. Nanofabrication approaches to form optical
structures in polymers are costly and time-consuming.12,13 Nanostructures can be fabricated on contact lenses by contact printing,14,15 nanoimprinting, microtransfer molding,16 pattern replication induced by an ion field, and ultrashort laser
pulse lithography. However, these fabrication approaches require multiple
steps, high-energy supplies, long fabrication times, complex setups,
and specialized equipment.12,13,17 In addition, they are not capable of producing accurate and reproducible
nanostructures on soft polymers.18,19 On the other
hand, most laser interference systems can produce nanostructures directly
on a variety of soft and hard materials. However, multiple laser beam
exposures can cause damage to soft materials, such as hydrogel-based
contact lenses.20

Here, a holographic
laser ablation method was developed to produce
optical nanostructures on commercial contact lenses. A black dye was
used on the contact lens to facilitate the interaction between the
interfering laser beams and the lens material. The dye thickness on
the contact lens was estimated through light transmission studies
(Supporting Information Figure S1).21 Low-cost optical nanostructures were rapidly
created by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) in holographic
Denisyuk reflection mode to create ablative interference fringes on
the contact lens surfaces.18,21,22 One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures were fabricated on the contact
lenses, and angle-resolved spectral measurements were performed to
characterize their optical properties. In addition, two-dimensional
(2D) nanostructures were fabricated to study the light diffraction
effects with monochromatic light and broadband white light. The surface
wettabilities of 2D nanostructures were determined through contact
angle analysis. Hydrophilic properties may aid in increasing the tear
distribution capability over the contact lens surfaces.23 The hydrophobicity was measured by sessile drop
technique as this method was fast and efficient to perform at static
and dynamic angles.24

Results and Discussion
Holographic
Fabrication of Nanostructures on Contact Lenses
Figure 1a shows
a schematic of the hologram recording setup in Denisyuk ablation mode.
The laser beam (λ = 1064 nm) initially directed by a mirror
traveled to the black dye (recording medium) deposited on the contact
lens and reflected off from a plane mirror, placed below, to ablate
the localized regions on the medium. The synthetic black dye on the
contact lens surface was selectively ablated to form a holographic
nanograting structure. This dye was chosen as it was able to increase
the laser absorption to facilitate the ablation process.30,31 The nanograting ablated on the contact lenses displayed diffraction
and hence a rainbow hologram effect (Figure 1b). The nanopatterns were formed near the
edge of the lens to prevent obstructing the vision through the center
of the lens. The 1D and 2D nanostructures (through multiple exposures)
were fabricated on the contact lenses (Figure 1c,d). The nanostructures fabricated were
imaged through optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques
(Figure 1e).

conditions (scale bar = 100 μm). (h) Contact lens thickness
variations in ambient humidity, fully hydrated condition (in DI water),
and hydrated condition (in artificial tear).

The contact lenses have different thicknesses and concave
geometry
for achieving comfort on the eye (Figure 1f). A dry contact lens was sliced to measure
the lens thickness variation (Figure 1g). The lens was sandwiched between glass slides for
testing purposes. The plain (unmodified) thickness was measured when
the lens was at ambient moisture. The thickest of the lens was ∼170
μm, which decreased to 65 μm in the central regions. On
the other hand, the thickness of the lens increased to 185 μm
at the edges and 85 μm in the center when it was fully hydrated
with DI water (Figure 1h). The artificial tear solution decreased the thickness of the contact
lens by ∼10 vol % as compared to that in DI water. This could
be attributed to the decrease in Donnan osmotic pressure caused by
the electrolytes in the artificial tear solution. The water content
in the contact lenses was considered at equilibrium to analyze swelling
degree, qw (eq 1), where mambient was the lens mass in ambient humidity and mhydrated was the lens mass in fully hydrated conditions.8 1  

Holographic DLIP ablates synthetic
black dyes on the contact lens
to form a grating. Nanoscale grooves were produced on the contact
lens surface due to the high energy of laser interference (SEM in Figure 1d). The main laser
ablation process on the lens was created by the laser interference
of two beams: YI the incident laser wave
(reference) and YR the reflected laser
wave (object) from a plane mirror. The higher power is produced when
two laser beams interact with each other, which can be described as 2   3   4  where A, v, t, and λ represent the axis plane,
velocity,
time, and wavelength, respectively. The grating spacing depends on
the exposure angle (θ) of the contact lens at ambient conditions.22,32 At an exposure angle of 35° (from the horizontal plane), a
grating spacing of 925 nm was produced. This spacing can be theoretically
calculated by using the grating equation: 5  where θ is the tilt angle of the sample
with the horizontal and Λ is the grating spacing. The difference
between the experimental results of grating spacing and the analytical
simulations was ∼3% (eq 5). Figure 2a–c shows the SEM images of the fabricated nanostructures
on the contact lenses and their optical transmission analyses in the
wavelength range of 400–850 nm. The transmission studies were
performed on plain contact lenses, lenses with thin black dye film,
and the lenses with nanopatterned gratings. The lenses were tested
in three phases: ambient humidity, fully hydrated with DI water, and
fully hydrated with artificial tear solution. The transmission spectra
for lenses changed in different humidity phases (Figure 2d). When the contact lens was
in ambient humid conditions, it had the highest transmission (∼95%).
However, the transmission decreased in fully hydrated DI water and
artificial tear conditions. The contact lens was a transparent material
in ambient humidity condition, but when in wet conditions, an additional
medium was absorbed by the lens’ matrix. This additional media
changed the effective lens thickness and the refractive index, which
altered the absorption and transmission through the lens based on
the refractive index of the solution (Figure 2d).

contact lenses. (a–c) SEM images of 1D nanostructures on the

Scale bar for (c) is 2 μm. The optical transmission spectra

dye coated lens, (f) and nanopatterned lens at different moisture

in (g) fully hydrated plain lens, (h) dyed lens in ambient humidity,
and (i) nanopatterned lens in ambient humidity.

However, the deposition of the black dye on the lens highly
decreased
the optical transmission by around 80% (Figure 2e).21 Increasing
optical absorption contributes toward improved ablation efficiency
with the Nd:YAG laser beam. However, if the absorption threshold reached
>90%, the laser beam could not ablate the sample, as a low-energy
laser beam passes through the sample and the returning beam from the
plane mirror becomes ineffective in producing interference. The formation
of the grating on the contact lens increased the transmission efficiency
by 35% (Figure 2f).
Optical polarization spectroscopy was also conducted on the plain
contact lens, dyed lens, and nanograting lens. Cross-polarized arrangement
was used, and the polarization of incident light was varied from 0
to 90° (Figure 2g–i). Neither the fully hydrated mode, the black dye on the
lens, nor the grating nanostructures seems to affect the polarization
properties of incident light.

Optical Characterization
of Nanogratings on Contact Lenses
Geometrical theory for
diffraction was used to simulate three monochromatic
light beams and their propagation through the nanogratings. The optical
diffraction produced by a 1D grating with 925 nm period and 800 nm
depth was modeled (details of the simulation method are in ref (17)) and compared to its experimental
results. The simulation was performed for lens indexes measured at
ambient humidity (1.50), fully hydrated state (1.40), and hydrated
with artificial tear state (1.33). Figure 3a1–c1 shows the simulated diffraction
from the 1D nanostructures on the contact lens. The matching experiments
were performed using three monochromatic light sources (450, 532,
and 635 nm), as shown in Figure 3a2–c2.

Figure 3 Simulation and experimental diffraction results

a periodicity of Λ = 925 nm on the contact lens surfaces in
ambient humidity, fully hydrated, and artificial tear conditions.
(a1) Simulated and (a2) experimental diffraction results for 450 nm
wavelength at different humidity conditions. (b1) Simulated and (b2)
experimental diffraction changes at 532 nm. (c1) Simulated and (c2)
experimental diffraction for 635 nm. Scale bar = 5 cm.

In response to a blue laser beam illumination (450
nm), the lens
nanopatterns resulted in a linear diffraction, with the first order
at an angle of ∼27° (eq 6). The diffraction angles matched the theoretical diffraction
equation: 6  where m represents the diffraction
order. When the contact lens was soaked in DI water for 20 min, the
thickness of the lens increased, elevating the first-order diffraction
to 29°. Then the contact lens was brought back to ambient humidity
and immersed in artificial tear solution for 30 min. It was soaked
for a longer time because the artificial tear had a viscosity (6.4
mm2 s–1) higher than that of water at
24° (laboratory temperature).33 The
optical analysis showed a slight increase in the first-order diffraction
spot (Figure 3a2).
The simulated diffraction values for the lens at ambient conditions
were identical to those of the fully hydrated lens. In response to
a green laser (532 nm), the lens nanopattern showed an increase in
diffraction angle for the first order, at around 34° for ambient
humidity conditions. The diffraction increased by 2° when the
lens was fully hydrated and an additional 2° when it was hydrated
with artificial tears (Figure 3b2).

A similar trend of angular change was obtained
with the red laser
beam illumination (635 nm), but the diffraction angle was higher than
that for blue and green lasers. There was an increment of 4°
between ambient moisture and fully hydrated conditions (Figure 3c2). The theoretical values
were estimated based on the effective refractive index of DI water
with contact lens (∼1.40) and artificial tears (1.336). Although
the refractive index of pure DI water is 1.33, when it is measured
within the contact lens, it becomes ∼1.40. The observations
showed that the experimental results matched with the theoretical
values. In the case of the artificial tears, the refractive index
was equivalent to that with the human tear.26,29,33,34Table 1 shows the experimental and
theoretical diffraction values for all the wavelengths.

The diffraction
angles were influenced by the laser wavelength.
Longer wavelengths of laser light diffracted through a larger angle
than the shorter wavelengths. In addition, the lens in ambient moisture
had the lowest diffraction angle as compared to the other two states
because the lens was the thinnest in this condition. Increasing the
lens thickness contributed to reducing the lens grating gap, which
increased the diffraction angles. In addition, lenses soaked in artificial
tear solution showed a diffraction angle higher than that of the fully
hydrated lens in DI water, even though it had proportionally smaller
effective thickness. This phenomenon can be attributed to the decrease
in Donnan osmotic pressure within the contact lens caused by the presence
of electrolytes in artificial tears. Therefore, the grating structure
in the lens could be used as a generic sensor to measure analyte concentrations
based on ionic changes from human eye tears via rapid
light diffraction changes.

The 2D periodic square nanostructures
were also fabricated with
holographic DLIP by multiple laser exposure. The sample was rotated
90° after the first exposure to produce the 2D square patterning,
with the same tilt angle used in both exposures (Figure 1a). The 2D grating structure
had a periodicity of 925 nm × 925 nm (Figure 4a). The 2D nanopatterning enhanced the transmission
by 10% in all humidity conditions as compared to that of the 1D nanostructures
(Figure 4b). This was
due to reduced dye-coated regions and overall more transparent lenses.
The diffraction measurements were performed with illuminations from
three laser beams on the 2D grating structure to measure the optical
properties of the lenses. The 450 nm illumination produced four diffraction
spots from the 2D patterning. The diffraction points were at 27°
on the x and y-axes (Figure 4c,d). Similarly, the diffraction
angles were 34° for 532 nm (Figure 4e,f) and 41° for the 635 nm laser wavelengths
(Figure 4g,h).

nm × 925 nm) fabricated by holographic DLIP on the contact lens.

in transmission mode upon illumination with three monochromatic beams:
(c,d) 450 nm, (e,f) 532 nm, and (g,h) 635 nm. Scale bar = 5 cm.

The 2D pattern was compared with
1D grating based on the diffraction
efficiency (eq 2). The
diffraction efficiencies (Ieff = I1/I0) of the nanopatterns
were measured by recording the intensities of the first-order I1 and the zero-order I0. Although the diffraction efficiencies in the three laser
illuminations were close for both 1D and 2D nanopatterns, the efficiency
of the 2D grating was higher. The zero-order diffraction of the 2D
grating was lower than that of the 1D grating, which indicated a higher
efficiency.

To evaluate the response of the nanopatterns to
broadband white
light, a goniometer setup was used to carry out angle-resolved diffraction
efficiency measurements. Diffraction spots from the nanostructures
of contact lens were analyzed in transmission mode. The spectroscopic
analysis of the rainbow diffraction was performed on a motorized rotating
stage with a broadband halogen light source illumination. The rainbow
distribution of grating diffraction was recorded by moving the motorized
stage with 0.5° step increments from −90 to +90°
(Figure 5a). The 1D
and 2D rainbow diffractions of the two contact lenses were measured.
The length measurements were based on placing a screen 16 cm away
from the diffraction samples. The angle-resolved diffraction from
the two lens gratings was measured at a maximum broadband light intensity
to quantify the highest value of diffracted wavelength distribution.
The maximization enabled the same bandwidth of grating diffraction
within the range of 400–850 nm to compare the x-axes of 1D and 2D nanostructured patterns. The rainbow diffraction
patterns of 1D and 2D lens gratings had same arcs (37–58°).
These patterns showed low visible wavelength intensity at 570 nm.
The diffraction efficiency of the nanopatterns at ambient humidity
condition was less than 10% (Figure 5b). The 2D nanostructures formed four rainbow diffraction
patterns based on the shape of the nanostructure. The x-axis of the 2D grating generated a trend and intensity similar to
that of the 1D rainbow diffraction patterns. The second rainbow diffraction
of the 2D grating on the y-axis had lower intensity. Figure 5c shows a holographic
contact lens attached to an artificial eye model, showing the location
of the nanostructure. The 2D rainbow image displayed diffraction on
the x- and y-axes (Figure 5d).

Fabricating nanostructures on the contact lens can change
the surface
contact angle as well as the optical properties. If the contact angle
increases due to the nanopatterning of the surface, then the contact
lens will become more hydrophobic. Therefore, its softness will decrease
and its suitability for human eye wear will become a challenge as
it can cause irritation.35 The hydrophobicity
of unmodified contact lens with sessile drop test (5 μL) was
∼59°,36 whereas the 1D nanopatterned
contact angle displayed 62.8° (Figure 1d). Four different nanopatterning structures
were produced for this experiment. The 1.28 μm × 1.28 μm
structure showed structural patterns similar to those of the earlier
2D nanostructure, but it had a relatively larger grating spacing (Figure 6a1). However, the
diffraction from the pattern showed two orders on each side of the x- and y-axes, with eight diffraction spots
in total (Figure 6b1).
The 2D square structure produced four identical rainbow diffraction
patterns but closer to the zero order (Figure 6c1). The square nanopatterning showed some
increase in the contact angle, reaching ∼71° (Figure 6d1). The second nanostructure
was a rectangular pattern and had a grating size of 1.68 μm
× 1.45 μm (Figure 6a2). It produced 12 diffraction spots, which were influenced
from the grating spacing and shape (Figure 6b2).22 In addition,
it created four visible rainbow diffraction patterns (Figure 6c2), and the contact angle
was lower than that in the first nanostructure (Figure 6d).

The next nanostructure was a rectangular pattern produced
by three
laser pulse exposures to obtain spacings of 0.85 μm × 2.4
μm (Figure 6a3).
The 2D nanostructure produced three horizontal sets of diffraction
spots (Figure 6b3).
Two orders of rainbow diffraction were produced in each axis (Figure 6c3). The contact
angle showed an increase of 11° as compared to the contact lens
in ambient humidity (Figure 6d3). The final structure was fabricated with three laser pulses
and had a smaller nanostructure geometry between large gaps (Figure 6a4). The contact
angle measured was ∼62.5°, closest to the 1D nanopatterned
lens and the unmodified contact lens (Figure 6b4).

The holographic DLIP system enabled
different types of nanopatterns
to be produced on the soft and fragile surfaces of the lens. The contact
lens material (silicon–hydrogel), which is not purely solid
at ambient humidity conditions, withstood up to three laser pulses
without significant damage to its relatively thin matrix. The four
different nanoscale shapes fabricated had an effect on the arrangement
of diffraction distributions, with grating spacing influencing the
location of the diffraction spots. Structures shown in Figure 6a1,a3 displayed an increase
in the contact angle, although the structure area on the lens was
relatively smaller (2 mm). The nanostructure geometries can be easily
optimized to tailor the wetting properties of contact lenses to suit
various eye conditions and comfort levels.

The nanopatterned
contact lenses were also used as generic refractive
index sensors. One of the 2D nanostructure patterns (925 nm ×
1555 nm) was used to sense analytes in the artificial tears. The x-axis diffraction pattern (responding to the 925 nm spacing)
was used to detect different concentrations of Na+ ions
in tears, as an increase or decrease in electrolytes can be an indication
of eye disorders.6 The normal concentration
of Na+ and Cl– ions in human tears is
142 and 135 mmol L–1, respectively.37 Different concentrations were prepared in DI water for
testing purposes. The contact lens was placed in a cuvette for continuous
optical measurements. The black dye and nanostructured contact lenses
were tested in transmission mode in the cuvette at different Na+ ion concentrations. The transmission of the black ink dye
on the contact lens showed no significant change for varying Na+ ions concentrations (0–230 mmol L–1) but decreased at higher concentrations (Figure 7a).

concentrations: (a) dye-coated lens and (b) nanograting on the contact
lens. (c) Diffraction measurements on the nanopatterned contact lens
at different Na+ ion concentrations. (d) Variation with
diffraction angles with Na+ ion concentrations (e–h)
Different designs (rings/patches) of holographic nanostructures fabricated
on contact lenses. Each image demonstrates the diffraction colors
observed at various angles (scale bar = 5 mm).

The transmission increased through the nanopatterned contact
lens,
and likewise, the diffraction intensity and angle changed with increasing
Na+ ions in the solution (Figure 7b). The nanogratings on the lens surface
had periodic grooves, and the refractive index of the groove medium
changed the gratings’ diffraction properties. Hence, the variation
in transmission was based on the change in the effective refractive
index due to the change of electrolyte concentrations (Figure 7c and Supporting Information Table S4). The diffraction measurements for the
contact lens nanostructures were carried out with a 635 nm laser illumination.
The readings were recorded every 10 min with different electrolyte
concentrations. This time frame was selected as a sufficient period
to achieve equal comparison between all concentrations. The results
showed an increase in diffraction angle with increasing concentration
of Na+ ions (Figure 7d). It is hypothesized that the increase in ion concentrations
caused the lens to expel water and shrink, leading to a decrease in
grating spacings and hence an increase in diffraction angles. The
lenses can be further functionalized by using engineered dyes/materials
which respond to specific analyses such as glucose, electrolytes,
or proteins in tears.

We also fabricated various holographic
patterns (nanostructures)
on contact lenses to show the flexibility and uniformity of the laser-based
fabrication method (Figure 7e1–h2). The holographic structures on contact lenses
displayed rainbow diffraction effects upon illumination with broadband
white light. These nanostructures can be designed in various shapes
(rings/patches) and can be used for sensing and also to enhance the
appearance of the contact lenses, for example, for cosmetic purposes.
Furthermore, the nanopatterns may change their visible colors in response
to changes in the curvature of the eyes, hence allowing the clinicians
to monitor ocular pressure in the diagnosis/monitoring of glaucoma.

With the low-cost and direct holographic DLIP method, optical nanostructures
were produced on commercial contact lenses. Depositing a synthetic
black dye on the contact lens allowed the formation of surface nanogratings
on the hydrogel matrix using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The contact lenses
fabricated in this work were tested over a year, showing no signal
drift or hysteresis, indicating long shelf life. These optical nanostructures
were fabricated at the edge of the contact lens to prevent any sight
obstruction or interference of human vision. The formation of 2D nanostructures
on the lens surface increased the diffraction intensity by more than
10% as compared to that of the 1D nanostructures. The versatility
of holographic laser ablation method was demonstrated by creating
four different 2D nanopatterns with different designs on the contact
lens surface without significantly changing the hydrophilicity properties.
Additionally, direct sensing of Na+ ions was conducted
by measuring the transmission and diffraction properties. Ocular conditions
such as edema, Graves’ eye disease, and glaucoma can be potentially
monitored from the change of eye curvature, which will have a direct
influence on the shape and spacing of nanostructures fabricated on
the lens surface. Other ocular diseases can also be predicted in early
stages when the contact lens matrix is functionalized and integrated
with the nanostructures to recognize concentration changes of analytes
and proteins in human tears.

Materials
and Methods
Preparation of the Recording Media on Contact Lenses
Commercial silicon–hydrogel contact lenses were used in this
work (Narafilcon A, Acuvue, Johnson & Johnson). All lenses had
a dioptric power of −0.5 with a base curve of 8.6 mm and a
total length of 14.2 mm.25 The oxygen permeability
of the contact lenses was 100 × 10–11. These
contact lenses were fabricated by the copolymerization of monofunctional
polydimethylsiloxane (MPMDSM), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), siloxane
macromer, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP), and they can accommodate 46 vol % of water (ESI Material, Table S2).26−29 To prepare a sample, the contact lens was dehydrated
and attached to a glass slide, and a synthetic black dye (thickness
∼915 nm) was directly deposited on it. The thickness of dye
on the contact lens was estimated based on the transmission of different
spin-coated thicknesses on glass substrates and compared with the
published work. This thickness was chosen because it optimized laser
interference in Denisyuk mode to provide a well-defined nanostructure
to interact with the laser beam (Supporting Information Figure S1).21 The
lens was hydrated with deionized (DI) water and artificial tear solution
(Hypromellose 0.3 wt % eye drop).27,28 In addition,
the contact lens was tested in a cuvette for continuous sensing measurements.

Fabrication of Diffraction Gratings on Contact Lenses
Holographic
direct laser interference patterning was used in Denisyuk
reflection mode. A nanosecond pulsed laser (λ = 1064 nm, 240
mJ, 3.5 ns) was used to ablate the black dye deposited over the contact
lens surface. The interference between the incident and reflected
laser beams ablated localized regions of the dye medium. The exposure
angle of all dye films was 35° from the surface plane of the
plane mirror, which was used to produce the object beam in the holography
setup.

Spectroscopic Measurements of the Ink Gratings
The
diffraction of light from 1D gratings was analyzed by normally illuminating
the periodic samples with blue (λ = 450 nm), green (λ
= 532 nm), and red (λ = 635 nm) laser beams and recording the
transmitted light on a flat screen placed perpendicularly 17 cm away
from the sample. The testing was performed on plain lenses, black
dyed lenses, and on lenses with patterned nanogratings, in three phase
conditions (dry lens, wet with DI water, and wet with artificial tear
solution).

Angle-Resolved Measurements of the Gratings
A halogen
light source (HL-2000, Ocean Optics) and a goniometer setup were used
to carry out angle-resolved measurements of diffraction efficiency
on the ink nanogratings. The sample was placed 17 cm away from the
optical probe to analyze the diffracted wavelengths. A motorized rotating
stage was used for the broadband spectroscopic analysis of the rainbow
diffraction produced by the nanostructure gratings. The rotation stage
had a precision of 0.5° step from −90 to +90°.
