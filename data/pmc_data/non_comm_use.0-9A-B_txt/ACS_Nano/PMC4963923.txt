The epitaxy of many organic films
on inorganic substrates can be
classified within the framework of rigid lattices which helps to understand
the origin of energy gain driving the epitaxy of the films. Yet, there
are adsorbate–substrate combinations with distinct mutual orientations
for which this classification fails and epitaxy cannot be explained
within a rigid lattice concept. It has been proposed that tiny shifts
in atomic positions away from ideal lattice points, so-called static
distortion waves (SDWs), are responsible for the observed orientational
epitaxy in such cases. Using low-energy electron diffraction and scanning
tunneling microscopy, we provide direct experimental evidence for
SDWs in organic adsorbate films, namely hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene on graphite. They manifest as wave-like sub-Ångström
molecular displacements away from an ideal adsorbate lattice which
is incommensurate with graphite. By means of a density-functional-theory
based model, we show that, due to the flexibility in the adsorbate
layer, molecule–substrate energy is gained by straining the
intermolecular bonds and that the resulting total energy is minimal
for the observed domain orientation, constituting the orientational
epitaxy. While structural relaxation at an interface is a common assumption,
the combination of the precise determination of the incommensurate
epitaxial relation, the direct observation of SDWs in real space,
and their identification as the sole source of epitaxial energy gain
constitutes a comprehensive proof of this effect.

materials
are nowadays the basis for many types of devices such as light emitting
diodes,1,2 solar cells,3 or field effect transistors.4−6 While applications typically feature
polycrystalline layers, from the scientific point of view highly ordered
molecular films are especially interesting as they allow for an undisturbed
insight into the physical properties of molecular layers and interfaces.
At the same time, electronic device efficiencies may profit from well-ordered
interfaces.6,7 With the use of epitaxial film growth, the
templating effect of a suitable crystalline substrate is exploited
to grow such highly ordered films, and interestingly, molecular arrangements
can form that do not naturally occur in the bulk material.8

The observed epitaxy of many, but not all,
organic films on inorganic
substrates can be classified by well-established rigid lattice concepts.9−12 Therein, the total energy of a film of an organic material, growing
under distinct orientations on top of a crystalline substrate, is
minimized if both lattices share common sets of lattice lines.12 In reciprocal space, this is tantamount to coincidences
of reciprocal adsorbate and substrate lattice points. One also speaks
of shared Fourier components or of lattices locking into registry.
For inorganic films, usually commensurate epitaxy is reported, where
the lattices match two-dimensionally leading to a finite number of
different adsorption sites of the atoms belonging to the basis. In
the case of soft organic films, more subtle modes of epitaxy exist
besides the commensurate one. In these so-called point-on-line (POL)
or line-on-line (LOL) epitaxy modes, the overlayer and the substrate
share only one set of lattice lines,9−11 which translates into
a uniaxial coincidence of lattice points in reciprocal space.10,11,13 The adsorption sites are all
different but restricted to a set of substrate lattice lines.

On the one hand, already the existence of such a uniaxial coincidence
of reciprocal lattice points can be shown to provide, in principle,
an energetic gain for a rigid molecular domain as compared to that
same domain rotated away to an arbitrary angle, i.e., an epitaxial energy gain.11−13 On the other hand, in a sufficiently
large rigid domain without any coincidences with
reciprocal substrate lattice points, the great number of different
adsorption sites leads to a total energy that is indifferent to rotation
or translation of the domain.11,12 Hence, no distinct
and reproducible azimuthal orientation should be expected in such
cases. Therefore, we strictly distinguish herein between structures with coincidences in reciprocal space and ones without
any. We exclusively refer to the latter as “incommensurate”
structures, thereby deviating from definitions of the term “incommensurate”
which encompassed POL and LOL structures14,15 and following more nuanced ones.10,11

However,
incommensurate adlayer–substrate combinations have
been reported which feature reproducible orientations of the adlayer.16−19 Novaco and McTague suggested that so-called static distortion
waves (SDWs) could be responsible for the observed epitaxial
growth of incommensurate overlayers.20−23 Improving existing approaches,24,25 the authors demonstrated theoretically that, if in an incommensurate
noble gas overlayer on graphite each atom is assumed to relax laterally
depending on the local interaction with the (rigid) substrate, these
displacements can minimize the total energy for a seemingly arbitrary
but in fact distinct orientation with respect to the substrate, without
any coincidences of reciprocal lattice vectors. Due to the incommensurability,
this growth mode consequently results in a deviation from strict translational
symmetry in favor of an incommensurately modulated overlayer.

The properties of such relaxations are usually discussed based
on the Frenkel–Kontorova model describing the intra–adlayer
interaction by harmonic springs and the adlayer–substrate interaction
by a sinusoidal function.24,26−30 Some authors argue that in the case of a sufficiently strong interaction
with the substrate, an incommensurate layer can relax into regions
with almost perfect coincidence, separated by relatively small soliton-like
domain walls with large misfit.27,29,30

Even though incommensurate epitaxial systems could be explained
reasonably well with the model of local relaxations, no direct experimental
confirmation of SDWs in their crucial role for the orientational epitaxy
of an incommensurate adlayer exists to date. Yet, in some studies,
local distortions of an adlayer have been reported30−34 and in a few cases could be directly linked to the
local interaction with the underlying substrate.32,34 In a recently published indirect visualization of SDWs for the case
of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride, a two-dimensional Young modulus
was imaged and a difference of the graphene lattice constant within
near-commensurate areas and soliton-like domain walls was reported.30 Another study claims to have observed the Novaco–McTague
mechanism in rotational modulations of rubrene on Bi(001).31 However, while all of these studies demonstrate
that the adlayer structure can in fact respond locally to the underlying
substrate, none of them rule out reciprocal lattice coincidences to
evidence true incommensurability. Hence, the local distortions may
arise due to varying adsorption sites but are not necessarily needed
to understand the adlayer orientation, in contrast to the incommensurate
case of Novaco and McTague where SDWs rule the epitaxy.

Here,
we present a direct proof of SDWs as the source of the orientational
epitaxy of incommensurate organic overlayers. The structure being
discussed is a physisorbed monolayer of the organic molecule hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) on graphite, a system which
was previously reported to be governed by simple commensurate epitaxy.8,35−37 We elucidate why, on the one hand, this adsorbate–substrate
combination is especially suited to detect SDWs, and why, on the other
hand, we believe that SDWs in organic adsorbate layers are rather
common yet difficult to be evidenced experimentally. The wave-like
sub-Ångström displacements from a rigid reference grid
are directly measured in both direction and size for more than 1,000
molecules using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). With the help
of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and a numerical model for
the adsorption energy of realistically large and flexible molecular
domains, we are able to exclude all rigid lattice concepts as sources
for an epitaxial energy gain. Our calculations, which contain no free
parameters, excellently reproduce all experimental results including
the optimal orientation of the HBC domain. In consequence, we unambiguously
identify the SDWs as the sole source of epitaxial energy gain, directly
confirming the Novaco–McTague mechanism for orientational epitaxy.
Moreover, our results prove that nanographene-type molecules and graphite
do not automatically form commensurate structures, despite their apparent
match in structure and symmetry.

Results and Discussion
LEED Measurements
Using LEED, STM, and numerical simulations,
we characterize SDWs in monolayers of HBC on both epitaxial graphene
(EG) on silicon carbide40 and natural graphite
(NG) substrates. There is no notable difference in the HBC growth
on both substrate materials, as evidenced by LEED measurements on
EG substrates discussed below, and on NG substrates (cf.Supporting Information). Hence, even
though EG features a surface reconstruction41 due to the underlying silicon carbide,41 the HBC molecules arrange just like on natural graphite, in agreement
with studies on another molecule adsorbed on the same substrates.42 While LEED measurements on EG exhibit a better
diffraction quality compared to the buckled natural graphite, the
surface reconstruction of EG makes STM measurements on adsorbed molecules
more difficult to analyze. Therefore, we discuss LEED measurements
on EG and STM measurements on NG.

Figure 1a shows a LEED image of a monolayer of HBC
on a tilted EG sample at room temperature that was corrected for imaging38 and tilt distortions.39 The beam energy was chosen such that both the specular beam near
the left screen edge and a first diffraction order of graphite near
the right edge are visible. Additional bright spots mainly in the
left part of the image can be attributed to the HBC lattice (turquoise
circles). However, the pattern displays features that are clearly
inconsistent with commensurate epitaxy. In particular, the reciprocal
HBC lattice does not coincide with the first order substrate spots.
This can be seen exemplarily for the (1̅,6) diffraction order
of HBC and one substrate spot in the dark blue zoom in Figure 1a, and is likewise true for
equivalent ones. Further, some spots (blue circles) cannot be explained
by the HBC lattice alone, but are consistent with multiple scattering43,44 between HBC and EG and would not be present if the HBC lattice were
commensurate. With LEEDLab, obtained from Scienta Omicron, we derive
high-precision lattice data by fitting it to all evaluable reflections.
The presence of the multiple scattering spots can be exploited to
obtain precise values for the epitaxial relation because their positions
depend sensitively on the relative scaling and shapes of both the
HBC and the graphite lattices. Moreover, by using the multiple scattering
description of the LEED pattern, we deliberately avoid the definition
of large supercells to explain these additional spots, since the lattices
are incommensurate, as will be evaluated later. The fit reveals for
this room temperature (RT) structure a hexagonal HBC lattice with
a lattice constant and a unit cell rotation θ between the first
HBC lattice vector a1 and [21̅1̅0]EG which slightly but significantly differ from the reported
commensurate values (cf.Table 1). The corresponding epitaxy matrix determined
here defines the relation between the HBC lattice vectors and the
graphite lattice vectors11 and deviates
from the matrix with strictly integer elements corresponding to the
previously reported commensurate structure35,36 (cf.Table 1 as well).

imply a rationality of the matrix elements.

STM Measurements
To determine the actual molecular
packing, we performed STM measurements on a monolayer of HBC on NG
at low temperatures (LT). At small scan ranges and negative sample
bias, the HBC molecules are imaged with submolecular contrast which
can be predominantly attributed to the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and resembles the corresponding Clar formula45,46 (Figure 1b). The
simultaneous observation of both possible mirror domains allows for
an accurate determination of the molecular rotation angle β
= (5.1 ± 0.5)° (cf.Figure 1c) with a precision atypical for STM measurements
(cf.Supporting Information). Judging from the STM data, the molecules lie flat or almost flat
on the surface. An apparent deviation from a perfect D6h symmetry is most likely tip-induced,
as can be inferred from varying contrasts in Supplementary Figure
2b in the Supporting Information.

Complementary, large-scale STM measurements (Figure 2a) reveal molecularly resolved domains that
are hundreds of nanometers wide, proving that the observed HBC growth
mode is not merely a finite-size effect. In such images, the molecular
centers appear dark at positive sample bias. Additionally, a two-dimensional
Moiré pattern becomes visible in contrast-enhanced STM images,
further confirming in real space that the HBC layer is indeed not
commensurate. Moreover, it allows for a precise Fourier-based determination
of the HBC lattice parameters (cf.Supporting Information) which are slightly altered to a smaller
lattice constant and a different unit cell rotation θ upon cooling
(LT structure, cf.Table 1). The Moiré pattern consists of hexagonally
arranged triangular regions which often show a slight chiral behavior,
best observable at their corners. The bright defects that are mainly
located near the corners of these triangular regions are too small
to be HBC molecules. We assume that, similar to a local surface reactivity,47 these positions are especially prone to adsorption
of rest gas molecules which might adsorb during the precooling of
the samples to 80 K before the introduction into the STM.

pattern in the molecule–substrate energy after relaxation.
(d) Molecular starting positions and calculated displacements, magnified
by a factor of 15 as well. Images b–d have the same lateral
scale.

While there is an obvious long-range
order in the HBC lattice that
is also evident from the sharp frequencies in Fast Fourier Transforms
(cf.Supporting Information), the bright-dark contrast of the Moiré pattern coincides
with barely noticeable local deviations from a rigid hexagonal HBC
lattice. These deviations follow a rather regular pattern which we
visualize by applying an algorithm to our STM images that was originally
developed to identify spot positions in LEED patterns with subpixel
resolution.38Figure 2b shows the numerically obtained rigid reference
lattice that fits best all molecular positions, as well as the magnified
local molecular displacement vectors from the reference lattice points
to the actual molecular positions. Even though the molecular positions
are somewhat disturbed by the bright point defects, the distribution
of the molecular displacements is clearly not random. Rather, it resembles
a smooth vector field as would be expected for static distortion waves:
the displacements approximately follow the Moiré triangle edges
and generally point away from the triangles’ corners. The average
displacement is only 0.52 Å, while the resulting distribution
of nearest-neighbor HBC bond lengths (cf.Supporting Information for the corresponding
histogram) has a standard deviation of 0.28 Å. This amounts to
only 3.7% and 2.0%, respectively, of the average nearest-neighbor
distance.

Importantly, neither the Moiré pattern nor
the pattern of
displacements implies the presence of a periodic supercell or an assembly
of many rigid commensurate patches separated by incommensurate domain
walls. Rather, they may be interpreted as a continuous domain of HBC
molecules whose positions are modulated with respect to an incommensurate
reference lattice.

Evaluation of the Epitaxy Type
While
the epitaxy between
HBC and graphite is clearly not commensurate, other epitaxy types
based on coincidences of reciprocal lattice vectors can as well be
excluded as an explanation for the distinct orientation of the HBC
lattice.9,11 POL and LOL epitaxy types can be ruled out
for symmetry reasons since both require a coincidence
of reciprocal adsorbate and substrate lattice points in only a single
direction. However, both the graphite and the HBC lattices exhibit
truly 6-fold symmetry in LEED. Hence, any coincidence of reciprocal
lattice points would have to repeat at multiples of 60°, therefore
leading to coincidences in different directions which is only possible
with either commensurate (ruled out already) or higher order commensurate
(HOC) growth (i.e., all epitaxy matrix elements are
rational numbers) producing a commensurate supercell.

While
the noninteger epitaxy matrix above was derived with a state-of-the-art
accuracy and produces no coincidences in reciprocal space within at
least seven substrate diffraction orders for the LT structure, it
inevitably contains a finite error margin that would allow one to
define a very high-order HOC structure. However, the search for any
arithmetically possible HOC structure is merely academic unless it
is shown to provide an epitaxial energy gain that would favor the
experimentally measured HBC domain orientation. As will be discussed
next by means of our numerical model, it makes no difference in terms
of adsorption energy whether the HBC layer exactly meets an HOC coincidence.
Therefore, we refrain from applying such an unnecessary restriction
of periodicity and aim to model a truly incommensurate HBC layer.

Modeling the Total Energy of an Incommensurate HBC Layer
To verify that the measured distortions indeed represent SDWs in
an incommensurate layer and that the SDWs decisively minimize the
system’s total energy, we developed a model to simulate the
spatial relaxation of each molecule away from exact lattice points.
The original Novaco–McTague theory requires calculated or experimental
data for both the adsorbate–substrate interaction energies
and the phonon dispersion in the adsorbate layer.20 However, the phonon dispersion relations are usually not
available for large aromatic molecules. Another inherent difficulty
arises from the strong anisotropy of the molecule–molecule
interaction and the dependence of the molecule–substrate interaction
on the molecular orientation.

We resolve these issues by employing
a simple energy gradient approach to optimize local molecular positions
according to the interplay of local adsorption energies and nearest-neighbor
interactions, relying on density functional theory (DFT) calculations
for realistic interaction energies and on well-determined experimental
parameters (cf.Methods and Supporting Information). In other words, the
particles in our model are able to lower the total energy of the system
by gaining more adlayer–substrate energy from adopting more
advantageous positions on the substrate than they lose due to the
straining of the intralayer bonds as a consequence of individual molecular
displacements.

We believe that our approach is more sophisticated
than pure symmetry
considerations,48 which cannot explain
the orientation we observe for HBC on graphite, or the Frenkel-Kontorova
model24,26,27 which oversimplifies
the intermolecular interaction of the HBC molecules as harmonic springs
and does not account for the molecular orientation dependence of the
molecule–substrate interaction. Our model does not impose restrictions
in terms of periodicity. No boundary conditions are applied, and a
realistically large domain with thousands of molecules can be simulated
without the presence of any periodic arrangement with respect to the
substrate. Moreover, we aim to not only calculate the energy gain
due to local distortions, as was the goal of other simpler approaches
including Novaco’s and McTague’s,20−23,25 but also to simulate amplitudes and shapes of the SDWs to compare
with our experiments. However, our algorithm resembles a quasi-static
relaxation and is thus less complex and computationally less expensive
than approaches which include dynamical processes.49−51 Nevertheless,
we will show that it adequately describes the local relaxation of
a globally incommensurate layer and, most importantly, accurately
predicts the optimal rotation angle of the HBC layer on graphite.

Resulting from such a calculation, Figure 2c,d shows cutouts of a structurally relaxed
HBC domain of 10,981 molecules, with the starting configuration chosen
to be the incommensurate reference lattice with the experimental LT
lattice constant of a = 13.95 Å and
rotation angles of θ = −8.66° and β = 5.1°.
The latter is kept fixed during the relaxation. Each dot in Figure 2c marks the relaxed
position of a molecule, while the corresponding molecule–substrate
interaction energy at that position is color-coded. In Figure 2d, the calculated molecular
displacements are depicted. The similarities between these calculated
patterns and their experimental counterparts are striking, especially
compared to the Moiré pattern without any relaxation which
does not resemble the STM images (cf.Supporting Information). Even the apparent chirality
of the triangular shapes in the Moiré patterns is reproduced.
Yet, more importantly, the calculated mean displacement of 0.44 Å
and the standard deviation of the nearest-neighbor distances of 0.29 Å
(see Supporting Information for the corresponding
histogram) are in excellent agreement with the experiment. As already
implied by the cutouts in panels c and d of Figure 2, each triangle of the HBC domain looks slightly
different from any other with respect to the color pattern or the
pattern of displacements within, due to the incommensurability of
the HBC reference lattice and the corresponding lack of strict periodicity.

The red curve in Figure 3a is obtained by repeating the relaxation with the same LT
lattice constant but with varying unit cell rotation θ as starting
points (step width 0.1°) while keeping the molecular orientation
within the unit cell (β) fixed. It confirms that the total energy
is indeed minimal for a unit cell rotation θ = −8.5 ±
0.2°, matching our experiments very well and differing significantly
from the commensurate value of −8.95°. We note that it
does not correspond to any “magic angle” due to a coincidence
of reciprocal lattice points but simply represents the orientation
at which the molecules are able to gain the most energy in the molecule–substrate
interaction before the intermolecular bonds counterbalance the relaxation.
In this angular range, the molecule–substrate interaction features
large gradients and the apparent Moiré period is especially
long, allowing for larger displacements before strained nearest-neighbor
bonds stop the relaxation. However, neither condition is fulfilled
to its maximum, and the optimal angle can only be found by realistically
describing the energy contributions and gradients. The fact that the
experimental value of the unit cell rotation, together with the directions
and the magnitudes of the molecular displacements constituting the
SDWs, are reproduced so strikingly well evidences that the interaction
energies are modeled realistically.

Figure 3 (a) Total adsorption energy per molecule
before (thin blue line)
and after (thick red line) relaxation of an HBC domain with 10,981
molecules (diameter approximately 170 nm), initially separated by
the experimental lattice constant of 13.95 Å, versus unit cell rotation θ of the starting configuration with respect
to graphite. The global minimum of the red curve at −8.5 ±
0.2° is in excellent agreement with the rotation angle of −8.66
± 0.02° determined experimentally (dotted vertical line).
(b) A similar calculation, but with a lattice constant of 13.9552
Å that exactly produces an HOC coincidence at θ = −8.57°
(dotted vertical line), being comparable but not identical to the
measured LT structure. Importantly, without relaxation (thin blue
line), the HOC structure does not produce any sizable
epitaxial energy gain, which demonstrates that the lattice coincidence
alone is not able to explain the experimentally found
alignment. Vice versa, after relaxation (thin black
line) no additional epitaxial energy gain at θ
= −8.57° compared to the relaxed incommensurate structure
from panel a (replotted here in red) is found for the HOC structure.

Compared to the total energy curve
of the unrelaxed domain, i.e., of
a rigid hexagonal
HBC lattice with the experimental lattice constant (blue curve in Figure 3a), it is obvious
that the SDWs alone provide a substantial average energy gain of 85 meV
per molecule for the optimal domain orientation, while there is no
discernible preferred orientation for the rigid domain
as is expected in the incommensurate case. This readily explains why
in all our experiments we observe a very reproducible domain orientation
which is, together with the lack of reciprocal space coincidences
in the simulated structure, a manifestation of orientational epitaxy
as proposed by Novaco and McTague. The resulting SDW energy gain is
also rather insensitive to different simulated domain sizes (cf.Supporting Information),
in agreement with the concept of an incommensurate layer that is merely
orientationally stabilized and in contrast to rigid lattice epitaxy
energy minima that characteristically depend on the domain size.11

While the blue curve in Figure 3a already demonstrates that
there cannot be a significant
epitaxial energy gain for any azimuthal orientation of a rigid HBC lattice with the experimental LT lattice constant, we emphasize
that our results and conclusions neither depend on the “right
choice” of the lattice constant nor on a deliberate avoidance
of any exact HOC configuration. On the contrary, for the presented
system, an HOC configuration both with and without SDWs is only a
special case that does not lower the energy further when compared
to the incommensurate case with and without SDWs. To show this, we
choose lattice constants to exactly reproduce the smallest reasonable
commensurate supercells close to either the experimental LT (cf.Figure 3b) or the RT structure (cf. Supplementary Figure
8b in the Supporting Information) at slightly
different angles θ. The first unit cell vector of the hexagonal
supercell close to the LT structure is a1,super = 8a1,HBC – 2a2,HBC, while the one close to the RT structure is a1,super = 6a1,HBC – 2a2,HBC.

First, in the rigid case (cf. respective blue curves in each figure), the HOC domains behave indeed
like rigid incommensurate domains when rotated over
the substrate: there is no meaningful energy minimum when the HOC
condition is met or at any other angle, even for these smallest supercells
discussed here. Since any larger supercell would only contain even
more molecules, thereby flattening the blue curves even more, this
supports our previous statement that rigid lattices cannot explain
the observed orientational epitaxy, even in the presence of an HOC
coincidence. Second, relaxing the molecular positions
of the respective HOC configurations, and for all other angles θ
(black curves in Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure 8b in the Supporting Information), results in curves being practically indistinguishable
from the ones of the relaxed incommensurate structures
(red curves). This demonstrates that the SDWs rule the energy curves
and that there is no additional epitaxial energy
gain when the HOC condition is met, as compared to the relaxed incommensurate
layer. Hence, both with and without SDWs the HBC layer has no reason
to prefer an HOC arrangement over an incommensurate one and the SDWs
are the only source of epitaxial energy gain in this system.

Conclusions
From the lack of strict periodicity in both the large-scale STM
images and the calculated Moiré pattern (cf.Figure 2c), together
with the domain energy being indifferent to the existence of an HOC
coincidence, we conclude that the HBC structure is indeed incommensurate
with graphite within experimentally meaningful limits.

Therefore,
in conclusion, we have shown that SDWs exist in an incommensurate
monolayer of HBC on graphite by directly measuring the local relaxation
with sub-Ångström resolution for every single molecule
in a large STM image. More importantly, via supporting
LEED measurements and theoretical modeling, we demonstrated that no
rigid lattice concept can explain the observed orientational epitaxy
and that the formation of the SDWs provides a substantial energy gain
over a rigid structure at the domain orientation observed experimentally.
Hence, we directly confirmed for a real system the stabilizing role
of SDWs which enables the growth of epitaxial organic films in the
absence of any coincidences, leading to an average epitaxial energy
gain of as large as 85 meV per molecule in the film.

The occurrence
of SDWs in the reported system is actually remarkable
because aromatic hydrocarbons with D6h symmetry such as HBC,36 coronene36 (both frequently dubbed nanographenes),
and benzene52 have all been reported previously
as commensurate on graphite. Owing to its symmetry and structure matching
with graphite, it has been suggested or implied that an HBC molecule
can be regarded simply as a small sheet of graphene,8,53 and the stated commensurate growth35−37 or the assumption that
the orientation of HBC molecules is determined exclusively by the
graphite lattice35 seemed natural. However,
due to our improved measurement techniques, it becomes clear that
HBC grows incommensurately, and that the orientation of the molecules
with respect to graphite are a result of balanced intralayer and interlayer
interactions, as already assumed earlier by others.36 Hence, the presence of the hydrogen atoms at the circumference
of the molecules cannot be neglected concerning structure formation.

The direct observation of SDWs leading to the above conclusions
was feasible by using the advantageous properties of the reported
system: (i) The disk-like shape of HBC in the STM images allowed for
using the aforementioned spot finding algorithm to assign a meaningful
position to each molecule in the STM images. (ii) The relatively soft
intermolecular bonds produced displacements large enough for direct
detection. And finally, (iii) the high symmetry of both substrate
and adsorbate allowed for the safe and unambiguous exclusion of point-on-line
and line-on-line epitaxy modes, reducing the complexity of the system.

Given the fact that high resolution data in combination with a
spot finding algorithm and lattice fitting in distortion-corrected
LEED patterns were all required to safely identify the incommensurability
of HBC on graphite and to determine the epitaxial relation with sufficient
accuracy for a numerical model, we suppose that incommensurate orientational
epitaxy driven by SDWs might be far more common than has been assumed
so far. Indeed, there are quite a few not fully understood epitaxial
but incommensurate organic adlayer systems17,19 which might be caused by similar local relaxations and may likewise
be explainable by our approach. The only requirement for the prediction
of the epitaxial orientation is a realistic model for the contributing
energies to calculate the corresponding gradients. This potentially
expands the range of molecule–substrate combinations for which
well-ordered molecular layers can be understood, predicted, and achieved.
Thereby, SDWs are also interesting from a technological point of view
since well-ordered interfaces and films can lead to higher efficiencies
of organic electronic devices.6,7 Moreover, since local
relaxation in the presence of matching lattice lines has been investigated
before,28,32 we anticipate that the respective roles
of lattice epitaxy and local relaxation for the resulting epitaxy
will be the focus of future research.

Methods
Materials
Epitaxial graphene (EG) is grown on a silicon
carbide single crystal (SiC-4H(0001)) following a procedure from ref (40), producing few-layer graphene
with thicknesses of two to three monolayers, estimated from X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The pristine SiC samples
were purchased from Sterling Semiconductor.

The natural graphite
(NG) crystals were purchased from Naturally Graphite, Michigan Technological
University, and range in diameter between 3 and 5 mm. They are glued
to molybdenum sample holders with PELCO High Temperature Carbon Paste
(purchased from Plano), cleaved in air, and degassed in ultrahigh
vacuum (UHV) at more than 800 K for several hours in order to evaporate
any volatile components of the adhesive. The same samples are then
recleaved in air and redegassed more gently at 600 K in UHV so as
to ensure a contamination-free surface prior to any experiment.

Sample Production and Analysis
The molecules are evaporated
in ultrahigh vacuum (5 × 10–10 mbar base pressure)
onto the room temperature samples at a rate of 0.1–0.2 monolayers/min,
while thickness control is ensured via differential
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).54 For the
samples discussed here, the deposition is stopped after an optical
monomer–dimer transition is observed in DRS, characterizing
the beginning of the growth of the second monolayer. From this, the
nominal thickness can be estimated to be 1.05 ± 0.05 monolayers.

Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is performed at room temperature
with a dual microchannel plate (MCP) LEED from OCI Vacuum Microengineering,
which has been distortion corrected and calibrated with LEEDCal, allowing
us to fit geometrical lattices to all evaluable diffraction spots
in any succeeding images with LEEDLab, both obtained from Scienta
Omicron. The real space structure of our samples is probed with a
low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) from SPECS Surface
Nano Analysis using KolibriSensors in the STM-only mode.

Algorithm To
Relax an Incommensurate Molecular Adlayer
If a molecular
adlayer is incommensurate with the crystalline substrate,
each molecule has a different adsorption site rp and experiences an individual
gradient in the molecule–substrate interaction energy ∇Emol-sub(rp). Since the intermolecular bonds in
the adlayer are of finite stiffness, it is natural to assume that
each molecule slightly moves into a more advantageous position by δp until the interaction
with its neighboring molecules (expressed by Emol-mol) stops that relaxation. The resulting directions
and magnitudes of these molecular displacements from the ideal lattice
points correspond to a balance between Emol-sub and Emol-mol.

On the basis
of these facts, we aim to model both energy contributions on the first-principles
level and then parametrize them in order to obtain local forces −∇Emol-sub and −∇Emol-mol on each molecule in a large domain consisting
of about 11,000 molecules. Since the intermolecular interaction Emol-mol is short-range, only the nearest-neighbor
contribution is considered in order to keep numerical costs manageable.
Additionally, the molecules are assumed to be flat-lying and retain
their orientational angles throughout the energy minimization. The
first assumption is consistent with our STM measurements, while the
latter assumption can be rationalized by the steric hindrance preventing
the molecules from significant rotations in densely packed domains.
The total energy is minimized iteratively by allowing each molecule
to take small steps along its (negative) individual total energy gradient
until the total energy of the domain converges. The displacement δp(s) of the pth molecule in iteration step s and those
of its nearest neighbors {δq(s)} are used to refine the displacements in step s + 1: δp(s+1) = δp(s) – τ{∇pEmol-sub(rp + δp(s)) + ∑q∇pEmol-mol(δp(s),δq(s))}. The factor τ only affects the
total number of iteration steps, if chosen small enough to reach convergence.
The third term represents the sum over all nearest-neighbor interactions
of molecule p. The algorithm outlined above was implemented
in MATLAB.

Thermodynamically, this constitutes a minimization
of the internal
energy of the system, not its free energy. However, for our STM experiments
at 1.2 K (cf.Figure 2a), entropy effects are expected to be negligible owing
to the low temperature. Further, remarkably, even at 300 K the HBC
epitaxy remains essentially unaltered (cf.Table 1). Therefore, we reason
that the entropic influence is very small due to the substantial energy
gain per molecule (cf.Figure 3) and the considerable domain sizes.

In the presented case of large aromatic molecules, the molecule–substrate
interaction Emol-sub(r,α) not only depends on the lateral position r of a molecule on the substrate but on its
orientation α with respect to the substrate (cf.Figure 1c) as well.
This complicates the model if different molecular orientations on
the substrates are of interest, and standard procedures such as an
expansion into a Fourier series55 based
on only a few values lose their advantages. Hence, we perform force-field
calculations with the Merck molecular force field (mmff94)56 using the grid technique57 and scale the results using DFT calculations to overcome
the known underestimation of the force-field energy corrugation of
graphite.58 The result is cross-checked
with exemplary, additional DFT calculations (cf.Supporting Information).

In the force-field
calculation, one HBC molecule (structurally
optimized semiempirically with the PM7 parametrization59) is translated and rotated over one unit cell
of graphite to map Emol-sub(r,α). The graphite has a thickness of
2 layers in bernal (AB) stacking to ensure a convergence of Emol-sub. The lateral mapping resolution
is 51 × 51 points; the angular resolution is 0.1°. For each
configuration, the adsorption height was optimized. Therefore, a lateral
displacement in the final relaxation algorithm automatically corresponds
to an effective three-dimensional adjustment of the molecular position.
Due to the relatively small adsorption height differences of less
than 15 pm, this minor effect is neglected in the intermolecular interaction.
The map Emol-sub(r,α = 0°) contains both the lowest and
the highest possible values of Emol-sub, since they essentially correspond to AB and AA stackings of the
HBC molecule on the top graphite layer, respectively. Hence, with
DFT (see below), we calculate both configurations in order to offset
and scale the map to match both extreme cases. The resulting scaling
factor is 14.6, in agreement with other studies.58 This rescaling is then applied to the maps for all angles
α (cf.Supporting Information).

Density Functional Theory Calculations
Calculations
of the ground-state electronic properties of the structures discussed
in this paper, in particular the interaction energies Emol-sub and Emol-mol, were performed within the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).60,61 The van-der-Waals (vdW) interaction is included based on a scheme
originally proposed by Dion et al.(62) However, following Klimeš et al.,63,64 we used the optB86b65 exchange-energy part of the total energy in the generalized-gradient
approximation (GGA).66 The local part of
the correlation energy is approximated within the local-density approximation
(LDA). Details of the implementation can be found elsewhere.63,64,67

Pseudopotentials for the
core electrons and all-electron-like wave functions have been generated
within the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method.68 A kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was used in the plane-wave
expansion of the wave functions of the valence electrons between the
atoms. The k-space integrations only require the
Γ point to obtain converged results.

A free HBC molecule
is modeled within a 25 × 25 × 15
Å3 hexagonal unit cell and relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman
forces acting on the atoms are reduced below 1 meV/Å. For a single
HBC molecule on the graphite surface, an 8 × 8 supercell of double-layer
graphene is used, where the atoms in the substrate are kept fixed.
The intermolecular interaction energies of a free-standing HBC layer
are calculated for two cases: longitudinal and shear deformation of
an intermolecular bond (see Supporting Information for details).

Additional Software
Gwyddion69 was used for STM postmeasurement processing.
The extraction of circular
height profiles from STM images was conducted with ImageJ70 and the Oval Profile Plot plugin.
