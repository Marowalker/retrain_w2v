The alloy Au–Ag system is
an important noble bimetallic
phase, both historically (as “Electrum”) and now especially
in nanotechnology, as it is applied in catalysis and nanomedicine.
To comprehend the structural characteristics and the thermodynamic
stability of this alloy, a knowledge of its phase diagram is required
that considers explicitly its size and shape (morphology) dependence.
However, as the experimental determination remains quite challenging
at the nanoscale, theoretical guidance can provide significant advantages.
Using a regular solution model within a nanothermodynamic approach
to evaluate the size effect on all the parameters (melting temperature,
melting enthalpy, and interaction parameters in both phases), the
nanophase diagram is predicted. Besides an overall shift downward,
there is a “tilting” effect on the solidus–liquidus
curves for some particular shapes exposing the (100) and (110) facets
(cube, rhombic dodecahedron, and cuboctahedron). The segregation calculation
reveals the preferential presence of silver at the surface for all
the polyhedral shapes considered, in excellent agreement with the
latest transmission electron microscopy observations and energy dispersive
spectroscopy analysis. By reviewing the nature of the surface segregated
element of different bimetallic nanoalloys, two surface segregation
rules, based on the melting temperatures and surface energies, are
deduced. Finally, the optical properties of Au–Ag nanoparticles,
calculated within the discrete dipole approximation, show the control
that can be achieved in the tuning of the local surface plasmon resonance,
depending of the alloy content, the chemical ordering, the morphology,
the size of the nanoparticle, and the nature of the surrounding environment.

==== Body
The term
“Electrum”
denotes the native gold–silver alloy that provided humanity
with some of its first experiences with metallurgy. Its surface abundance
in prominent locations of antiquity, mainly in the Upper Nile River
Valley, is reflected in archeological findings pertaining to the earliest
civilizations, beginning in the third millennium BC in ancient Egypt.1 In early Western Civilization, Electrum was mentioned
already in Homeric Poems (Iliad)2 describing
the Trojan war between Greeks and the defenders of the city of Troy
in Lydia (modern western part of Turkey). The Lydians were the first
people to mint coins fashioned from Electrum during the reign of Croesus.
Primary uses of Electrum were naturally jewelry as well as other adornments
for decorative arts3 and coinage for financial
transactions and storage of wealth.4,5 Its eminent
suitability for such applications derives from its availability at
the earth’s surface (minimal mining required), its facile workability
(minimal metallurgical treatment, no smelting required), and its high
nobility. Remarkably, its high silver content was then considered
important to its value, as the scarcity of accessible silver in Asia
Minor6 meant that one part of gold was
equal in value to two and one-half parts of silver.7

Nowadays, the interest in ancient bimetallic materials
such as Tumbaga(8) and Electrum
still remains
since those alloys have different physical and chemical properties
compared to their individual constitutive metallic elements. Beside
this composition dependence, we have three additional knobs of freedom
at the nanoscale, that is, size,9 morphology,10 and segregation/ordering,11 playing a major role in the properties of the nanoalloy.12,13 To fully understand the behavior of bimetallic nanomaterials, a
knowledge of the phase diagram is required.14 In fact, the phase diagram is a fundamental starting point when
performing materials research in such fields as nanotechnology because
it undergoes modifications compared to its bulk counterpart due essentially
to the importance of the surface in the nanoscale regime. Bulk phase
diagrams were previously determined by costly experimental procedure;
nevertheless, this method cannot be pursued for nanoalloys because
calorimetry is still challenging at the nanoscale.15,16 Consequently, a theoretical approach is required. Bulk alloys were
adequately described within the frame of classical thermodynamics
and statistical physics in which the number of atoms and the volume
are very large. However, the situation is different for nanoalloys
in which the number of atoms is small. In fact, changes in the volume
only affects extensive properties while intensive properties remain
unchanged, consequently small systems are no longer extensive due
to surface effects. Thus, we cannot use classical thermodynamics at
the nanoscale for which the extensive state functions are no longer
linearly proportional to the number of particles.17,18 Therefore, considering the size of the system as a variable is central
to applying thermodynamics at the nanoscale (named as “nano-thermodynamics”)
and this initiative was launched by Hill in the sixties.19,20 Nowadays, nanothermodynamics18 is recognized
as a fundamental approach to predict the phase diagrams of nanoalloys
over the entire composition range since other methods such as Density
Functional Theory (DFT),21,22 Molecular Dynamics,
(MD)23,24 and Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC)25 simulations are restricted to a limited number
of atoms.26 Therefore, nanothermodynamics
appears as a complementary approach to determine some fundamental
issues in the behavior of nanoalloys.8,18,27 Although, experimentally, the final properties of
nanoparticles synthesized chemically are mainly governed by kinetic
considerations; their binary phase diagram, obtained from the temperature
state function versus the alloy composition, describes an equilibrium
situation and therefore does not depend on the way to reach the equilibrium.
Kinetics will favor the growth of one shape over another but as soon
as the equilibrium shape is reached, its properties are described
by the corresponding binary phase diagram.

Among bimetallic
materials, noble metals play a major role.28,29 The noble metals consist of 4d (Ag, Pd, Rh, Ru) and 5d (Au, Pt,
Ir, Os) elements. The increasing filling of d orbitals going from
the left to the right in the periodic table and the increasing cohesive
energy value down a group of the periodic table determine silver and
gold as the noblest metals.30 At the nanoscale,
as the surface to volume ratio increases, a greater amount of the
material can come into contact with the surroundings, moreover more
atoms are present at the edges and corners of the structure, thus
presenting a lower coordination number and then a higher reactivity.9 Indeed, at this scale, the cohesive energy is
reduced and the electrons’ motion is confined, making then
gold and silver more sensible to interactions.9 Under the action of an electromagnetic field, the electron cloud
of these nanoparticles can undergo a coherent collective oscillation
movement called plasmon, particularly attractive for optical applications.31,32 The synergy between these two metals is also highly desirable to
enhance the functionality and potential applications of those metals
in catalysis and medicine.29 In fact, it
is used to catalyze the CO oxidation,33,34 as well as
to probe cancer cells.35

A first
paper considering the size effect on the Au–Ag phase
diagram of a spherical nanoparticle has already been published by
Park et al.36 by using the CALPHAD method.
The first goal of the present paper is to build on this work by considering
size, shape, and segregation effects on the phase diagrams of various
Au–Ag polyhedral nanoparticles, namely, the tetrahedron, cube,
octahedron, decahedron, dodecahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, truncated
octahedron, cuboctahedron, and icosahedron at different sizes (10
and 4 nm). The second goal is to present two new segregation rules
to determine the nature of the segregated element at the surface of
bimetallic nanoalloys. Finally, the third goal is to predict the optical
properties of the Au–Ag nanoalloy for various sizes, shapes,
compositions, chemical ordering, and surrounding environments.

Results
and Discussion
At the bulk scale, the Au–Ag system
forms a totally miscible
alloy in the solid phase according to the Hume–Rothery rules;37 that is, the atomic radius, crystal structure,
valence, and electronegativity of gold and silver are similar (Table 1). Consequently, this
system (called isomorphous) forms the simplest possible
binary phase diagram, exhibiting a lens-shape in the temperature–composition
plot. The diagram consists then of three regions. At high temperature,
there is a liquid solution while at low temperature, there is a solid
solution. Within the lens region, there is a mixture of solid and
liquid phases. The liquidus is defined as the curve above which the
system is fully liquid while the solidus is defined as the curve below
which the system is fully solid. The liquidus and solidus curves have
to meet each other at the two ends of the phase diagram, corresponding
to the two pure elements of the considered system, gold and silver.
Using a regular solution model to explicitly consider a nonzero enthalpy
of mixing, the solidus–liquidus curves are calculated by the
following set of equations:38,39 1  Here xsolidusA (xliquidusA) denote
the compositions of the solid (liquid) phases of silver (A) at given
temperature T; TmA and TmB denote the size-dependent
melting temperatures of silver (A) and gold (B); ΔHmA and ΔHmB denote their respective size-dependent melting enthalpies; Ωl and Ωs are the respective size-dependent
interactions parameters in the liquid and solid phases; and R is the characteristic ideal gas constant.

To calculate the phase diagram at the nanoscale, the size-dependent
parameters TmA, TmB, ΔHmA, ΔHmB, Ωl, and Ωs are calculated through eq 2(40) which considers the internal structure of the material, in this
case the face centered cubic (fcc) structure of both elements, gold
and silver, as well as the external structure (shape and surface properties)
of the particle. 2  Here X(hkl) denotes a set of factors
equal to {1/2, √2/4, √3/3} in the fcc case, for the {100,
110, 111} faces, respectively. γl and γs are the respective surface energies
in the liquid and solid state; a is the bulk lattice
parameter; and Nsurf/Ntot is the ratio of surface to total atoms.

The
bulk Au–Ag phase diagram is calculated from the set
of eqs 1 and presented
in Figure 1. It is
clear that the phase diagram is very well described at the bulk scale
by a regular solution model meaning that the parameters Ωl and Ωs describing the interactions inside
the liquid and solid states, respectively, are adequate.41 To the best of our knowledge, no more recent
Ωl and Ωs values describing the
interactions between silver and gold in both states have been published
in the literature since 1988. Both interaction parameters have negative
values, meaning that the formation of the alloy between both elements,
silver and gold, is favored. The topological changes on the phase
diagram due to different values of interaction parameters have been
discussed in detail by Tanaka et al.42 and
Lee et al.43

Figure 1 Bulk phase diagram of
the gold–silver alloy. Experimental
points are taken from ref (63). The liquidus–solidus curves are plotted using the
regular solution model (eq 1).

To plot the Au–Ag phase
diagram at the nanoscale for various
polyhedral shapes (Figure 2), the size and shape effects on the following set of parameters
{TmA, TmB, ΔHmA, ΔHmB, Ωl, Ωs} have to be evaluated through eq 2 and inserted into eq 1. From Figure 2, it is evident that the entire phase diagram
is shifted down with size for each investigated shape; that is, the
liquid phase region of the phase diagram is enlarged as the size of
the particle becomes smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence
of a “tilting” effect for some particular shapes , that
is, cube (Figure 2f),
rhombic dodecahedron (Figure 2i), and cuboctahedron (Figure 2h). The tilting effect observed on those shapes can
be understood by looking at the facets involved. In fact, the stronger
size effect observed for gold compared to silver is due to a higher
surface energy difference between the facets involved in the cube
(all (100) facets), the rhombic dodecahedron (all (110) facets) and
the cuboctahedron (mix of (111) and (100) facets) compared to the
liquid state (Table 1). However, the tilting effect is not apparent for the truncated
dodecahedron due to a higher proportion of (111) facets compared to
(100) facets. It is very interesting to note that the tilting behavior
has also been noticed by Chen et al.44 when
they investigated the melting behavior of a 55-atom Au–Ag cluster
by MD using a Gupta many-body potential. In fact, they revealed a
decreasing melting temperature with increasing Au content in the case
of an icosahedral morphology. It has also been noticed by Nanda et
al.45 that gold exhibits an anomalous behavior
compared to silver. In fact, they noticed that the temperature of
evaporation of gold nanoparticles was lower compared to the ones of
silver nanoparticles investigated under the same conditions. Melting
and evaporation being both a measurement of thermal stability, it
is now possible to link this observation to our investigation concluding
that the tilting effect observed on the phase diagram is responsible
for the observed behavior.

the bulk, 10 and 4 nm behavior of the alloy, respectively.

To consider the segregation at the surface of binary
nanoalloys,
the Williams–Nason’s model46 is used since it is based on the knowledge of the thermodynamic
properties of the bulk rather than on the surface. Actually, it is
constructed on a bond-breaking concept allowing the nonequivalence
of different sites at the surface and in the bulk. The solidus and
liquidus curves at the surface of the alloy are given by the following
equations: 3a   3b  Here xsoliduscore and xliquiduscore are the bulk solidus and liquidus composition given by the set of eqs 1; that is, when segregation
is not considered. ΔHvap = |ΔHv,A – ΔHv,B| is the absolute difference in the enthalpy of vaporization of the
two pure elements. ΔHsub = |ΔHs,A – ΔHs,B| is the absolute difference in the enthalpy of sublimation of the
two pure elements. z1v/zv is the fraction
of nearest neighbor atoms missing for atoms in the first layer (for
atoms belonging to a (111) face in a fcc structure, z1v/zv = 0.25).

It is clear from Figures 3 and 4 that silver
is preferentially
found at the surface for all the shapes investigated. Actually, at
a given temperature, the liquidus–solidus curves are shifted
toward compositions richer in silver when moving from the core (curves
without segregation) to the surface (curves with segregation). At
small scales, the surface segregation of silver is then in agreement
with the MMC simulations performed by Deng et al.47 on Au–Ag nanoparticles for which the size ranges
from 2.5 nm until 7.2 nm. This has also been confirmed on a 34-atom
and a 38-atom Au–Ag cluster by Rossi et al.48 using a semiempirical potential and by Curley et al.49 using a Gupta many-body potential coupled with
a genetic algorithm search technique, respectively. Another study,
using a genetic algorithm global optimization approach coupled with
DFT showed that the chemical ordering exhibiting an Aucore–Agshell structure is favored for sizes below 68
atoms.50 It seems that for smaller clusters,
gold can be promoted to the surface if a charge transfer occurs between
Ag and Au.51,52

and nonsegregated liquidus–solidus

(f) cube, (g) truncated octahedron, (h) cuboctahedron, and (i) rhombic

(b) octahedron, (c) decahedron, (d) dodecahedron, (e) icosahedron,
(f) cube, (g) truncated octahedron, (h) cuboctahedron, and (i) rhombic
dodecahedron.

Particularly, for the
following shapes, the cube (Figure 3f, Figure 4f), the rhombic dodecahedron (Figure 3i, Figure 4i) and the cuboctahedron (Figure 4h), the tilting effect undergone
by the liquidus-solidus curves does not affect the segregated element;
for those shapes, silver is still the element found at the surface.
For the cuboctahedron with a length size equal to 4 nm, we can see
that the tilting effect is not complete, nevertheless, silver is always
predicted to be the element segregated to the surface. Furthermore,
there is a zone in which there is no segregation, and in that composition
range the alloy behaves like a pure element, exhibiting a congruent
behavior, similar to the one found in the Au–Cu alloy.8 From Figures 3 and 4, it seems that thermodynamically,
gold will never diffuse at the surface. The surface composition is
determined by the dimensionless difference in the heat of sublimation
of gold and silver, ΔHsub/kT. So theoretically, we varied ΔHsub/kT which controls surface segregation
and plotted the corresponding segregated liquidus–solidus curves
into Figure 5. From
this graph, we can conclude that silver will always be at the surface
whatever the value of ΔHsub/kT is. This remains valid whatever the considered shape
is, among those investigated in this manuscript.

a cuboctahedron at 4 nm calculated with different
ΔHsub/kT values.
In all cases, silver is always predicted to be found preferentially
at the surface.

Therefore, the nature
of the segregated element is not modified
by the tilting effect; this conclusion is especially important for
the study of nanoalloys in general. Indeed, we may find other nanoalloys
exhibiting this tilting effect in their phase diagrams when the size
is reduced and for some specific shapes; but from our current study
we know that this behavior will not modify the nature of the segregated
element. To predict the nature of the segregated element, preferentially
found at the surface of the bimetallic nanoalloy, we have developed
two segregation rules based on the melting temperature and surface
energy. The first rule says that if the bulk melting temperature of
element A is larger than the one of element B, then element A will
segregate to the surface. If the bulk melting temperature of both
elements have more or less the same magnitude, then the segregated
element will be determined by the surface energy, this will be the
second rule. To be considered similar, the difference between the
two melting points should be less than ∼10% of the highest
melting temperature. The second rule says that if the solid surface
energy of element A is smaller than the one of element B then element
A will segregate to the surface. To be complete, before using those
two segregation rules, we have to determine the miscibility of the
alloy using the Hume–Rothery’s rules.37 In the case of total miscibility or partial miscibility,
then the first and second rules apply. In the case of total immiscibility,
only the second rule applies. Those rules have been summarized in Table 2 to explain the surface
segregation of different bimetallic nanoalloys (Supporting Information). It has been shown experimentally
that in the case of Au–Cu8 and Cu–Ni,27 the segregated element was Au and Ni, respectively,
in very good agreement with the proposed rules. In the case of Ag–Cu,
Ag–Ni, and Ag–Co, according the proposed rules, Ag always
goes to the surface, in very good agreement with ref (53). In the case of Pt–Au,
Pt–Ni, and Pt–Pd, the segregated element has been demonstrated
by Reyes-Nava et al.54 to be Au, Pt, and
Pd, respectively, again in very good agreement with the proposed rules.
In the case of Au–Ni, by applying our rules, we predict that
Au goes to the surface in agreement with ref (55). In this work, Au–Ag
nanoparticles have been synthesized by wet chemistry and characterized
by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), high
angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. As a result of the minor difference between
the lattice constants of the two constitutive metals, direct identification
through lattice parameter determination using HRTEM is not very useful.
However, identification using the chemical signature of silver and
gold through EDX line scan and EDX elemental mapping is decisive by
confirming the presence of silver at the surface as theoretically
predicted (Figures 6 and 7). Other EDX line scans are provided
electronically as Supporting Information. The element found at the surface (silver) is also the one predicted
by using the two segregation rules. Therefore, from all the bimetallic
nanoalloys investigated in this manuscript (Table 2), it seems that the driving force for surface
segregation is thermodynamics by minimizing the free energy of the
nanoparticle. However, kinetic factors and oxidation effects may also
play a role by promoting the more electropositive oxo-philic metal
to migrate to the surface.

The presence of silver at the surface
is particularly important
in terms of optical response as shown by Lopez–Lozano et al.56 on a 147-atom AuAg cluster. Therefore, the optical
properties of larger gold–silver nanoparticles were predicted
by using the discrete dipole approximation method (DDA) developed
by Purcell and Pennypacker.57 DDA has been
coded in a program called DDSCAT,58,59 which is used
for our calculations (Supporting Information). The absorption band observed in the UV–vis region is related
to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) of the two metals constituting
the alloy. Ag shows an intense SPR whereas Au exhibits a broad and
damped SPR. The reason for this behavior is due to the different electronic
configuration, specifically the position of the d orbitals in each metal. From Figures 8 and 9, it is clear that the
SPR is more intense for larger sizes and becomes broadened and less
intense with smaller sizes. At a given size, the truncated octahedron
and the dodecahedron exhibit the strongest SPR around 0.36 μm.
For each given shape, when the concentration of silver is increased
in the Au1–x–Agx alloy, the absorption maximum shifts from 0.52 to
0.36 μm which corresponds to the SPR of gold and silver, respectively.
Considering the surface segregation of silver, the SPR peak of Ag
undergoes a redshift (Figure 10a). The situation is similar at smaller scales for clusters
where the absorbance spectrum was not strongly affected by the chemical
ordering as already reported by Barcaro et al.60 The largest shift appears for the core–shell structure
which can be considered as the most extreme case of surface segregation.
As the silver surface segregation increases, the peak becomes also
broader. On Figure 10b, the effect of the solvent is investigated and a redshift of the
most intense peak is observed when the refractive index of the solvent
is increased. On Figure 10c, the optical properties of Au1–x–Agx nanoparticles immersed
in hexane is plotted for different concentrations. Finally, the UV–visible
spectrum is acquired experimentally for three different colloidal
solutions, namely Au25Ag75, Au50Ag50, and Au75Ag25, where a very good agreement
between the theory (Figure 10c) and the experiment (Figure 10d) was obtained.

Conclusions
The most important results
achieved within this thermodynamic approach
are the existence of a tilting effect found in the Au–Ag phase
diagram at small sizes (10 and 4 nm) for some particular shapes (cube,
rhombic dodecahedron and cuboctahedron) and the determination of the
preferential presence of silver at the surface for all the shapes
investigated. Two segregation rules based on melting temperatures
and surface energies have been identified to predict the surface segregation
in bimetallic nanoalloys. It has been shown that the surface segregation
of silver had a small effect on the optical properties compared to
the nature of the solvent. Of course, the composition of the alloy
plays a fundamental role in the peak intensity of the SPR of Au and
Ag. For a number of different alloys,8,27 nanothermodynamics
has been shown to have excellent predictive and explanatory capabilities;
however, a complete understanding of the behavior of nanoalloys is
not possible using only one technique alone but requires all the current
existing techniques, namely, nanothermodynamics, DFT, MD, and MMC
to be used in coordination to reach that goal.

Methods
Chemicals
Gold chloride (AuCl, 99.9%), silver nitrate
(AgNO3, 99.9999%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), and oleylamine
(OLA, 70%) were used without any special treatment.

Synthesis
The synthesis was carried out by simultaneous
reduction of gold and silver salts in the presence of oleic acid in
organic solvent. The total metal concentration in the solutions was
kept at 28 mM and the Au:Ag molar ratio was varied to obtain different
composition. In a typical synthesis, gold chloride, silver nitrate,
0.5 mL of OA and 4.5 mL of OLA were mixed at room temperature, and
then heated at 130 °C under magnetic stirring for 2 h. The solution
gradually changed to a dark color. Subsequently, the temperature was
increased to 300 °C (∼10 °C min–1) and kept for 30 min. Eventually, the colloidal solution was cooled
at room temperature and the particles were precipitated by adding
an excess of ethanol/acetone and centrifuging at 9000 rpm to remove
all the undesirable products. The supernatant was discarded, and the
precipitated was dispersed in hexane. This process was repeated two
times. The resulting particles were drop-casted onto 3 mm nickel grids
and dried in air for their subsequent characterization.

Electron Microscopy
For the electron microscopy analysis,
a drop of the Au–Ag colloidal solution was deposited onto a
commercial nickel TEM grid and dried in air. The Au–Ag nanoparticles
have been observed and characterized by high resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), high angle annular dark field (HAADF)
imaging and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on
a JEOL JEM-ARM200F (FEG-STEM/TEM) probe aberration corrected electron
microscope operating at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM images were obtained with
a convergence angle of 34 mrad and a collection semiangle varying
from 50 to 180 mrad. The EDX analysis was performed using EDAX instrumentation
attached to the JEOL ARM200F microscope. Line scans and chemical maps
were obtained using the EDAX Genesis software. EDX spectra were obtained
using a probe size of 0.13 nm with a probe current of 140 pA.

UV–Visible
Spectroscopy
The UV–visible
spectroscopy was carried out on a Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer
from Agilent Technologies. A baseline was acquired using hexane as
reference and then the absorbance of three different colloidal solutions
(Au25Ag75, Au50Ag50, and
Au75Ag25) was measured.
