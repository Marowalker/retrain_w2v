Single-entity electrochemistry aims
to expand the toolkit for probing matter at the nanometer scale. Originally
focused largely on electrochemically active systems, these methods
are increasingly turning into versatile probes complementary to optical,
electrical, or mechanical methods. Recent studies of the nucleation,
structure, and stability of gas nanobubbles, which exploit electrochemistry
at nanoelectrodes as generation and stabilization mechanisms, are
prototypical examples. These measurements illustrate the interplay
between advances in electrochemical methods and strategies for extracting
microscopic information from the results.

==== Body
In large
part driven by the development of increasingly sophisticated nanoscale
experimental tools, single-entity electrochemistry (SEE, reviewed
recently)1 is redefining the boundaries
of electroanalysis. Following in the footsteps of single-entity electrical,
optical, and mechanical meso- and nanoscale experimental methods,
SEE pursues two main aims. First, there is a need for direct observation
and understanding of the properties of individual electroactive nanoparticles
or macromolecules. Second, there is a desire to develop electrochemistry-based
tools for studying systems that are not themselves necessarily electroactive
in nature but can be interrogated via electrochemical
means.

Single-entity assays offer several widely recognized
benefits. Large numbers of measurements on single microscopic entities
or time-resolved events contain more information than the mere ensemble
average of these measurements, as is typically probed in macroscopic
experiments. For fundamental research, single-entity assays enable
researchers to probe variations within a population of analytes, detecting
rare events and resolving microscopic dynamics.2 For applications, they form the basis for “digital”
assays based on, for example, counting individual analytes instead
of measuring an average response, which can help overcome drift in
precision measurements.3 However, single-entity
measurements are inherently stochastic. This randomness can have a
static origin, for example, heterogeneities in a population, or can
result from physically unavoidable intrinsic thermal and quantum fluctuations.
Learning to identify, to measure, and to extract information from
stochastic signals is thus at the heart of SEE.

In this issue
of ACS Nano, Edwardset al. describe and analyze the electrochemically driven
nucleation of individual nanobubbles.4 This
work provides a fascinating snapshot of the state of the art for SEE
methods and illustrates both the inherent experimental challenges
as well as the more conceptual aspects of extracting meaningful microscopic
information from stochastic data.

A
Remarkable Experimental System
In electrochemical single-nanobubble
generation, an approach introduced in 2013,5 a reduction or oxidation reaction generates gas molecules at the
surface of a nanoelectrode. The dissolved gas near the surface of
the electrode becomes highly supersaturated as a result, in turn driving
the nucleation and rapid growth of a gas bubble. The bubble remains
pinned to the electrode, partially blocking its surface and thus slowing
down further gas generation. A dynamic equilibrium is eventually established
in which gas generation at the partially blocked electrode is compensated
for by diffusion away from the nanobubble, forming a stable nanometer-scale
bubble that covers a large fraction of the electrode. The presence
of the bubble is detectable as a decrease in the faradaic current
at the electrode (ironically, interference from bubbles is an unwelcome
phenomenon in most electrochemical experiments). This system is unique
in the field of surface nanobubbles6−8 in that the mechanism
for the formation of the bubble and its stability is fully understood
and consistent with classical gas–liquid equilibrium and that
bubbles can be created and annihilated at will and in real time via control of the electrode potential.

It is worth
reflecting on the ingenuity of this approach and the careful balance
of factors at play. Straightforwardly, the electrode must be sufficiently
hydrophobic for the bubble to remain pinned to its surface (ensured
by the choice of materials), and mass transport must be sufficiently
rapid to establish a dynamical steady state with the bulk (ensured
by the small electrode size). More subtly, stable bubbles can only
exist if the rate at which gas molecules are electrochemically generated
at the nanoelectrode is equal to the rate at which they diffuse into
the bulk solution. Such a balance can be reproducibly achieved only
because a negative feedback relation exists between the rate of mass
transport of the electroactive substrate molecules to the electrode
(which is proportional to the rate at which gas molecules are generated)
and the size of the nanobubble (which determines the outward flux
of gas molecules). This relationship is opposite to that in typical
electrochemical measurements, where the mass transport rates of substrate
and product either increase or decrease together upon changing the
geometry of the electrode. Finally, the system exhibits a bifurcation
between a metastable, nanobubble-free branch and a stable branch with
a nanobubble at the electrode, as illustrated in Figure 1. To be experimentally observable,
the transition from the metastable to the stable branch must occur
at such a rate that an observable amount of time is spent in the metastable
branch. Such fine-tuning is ensured because the bubble generation
rate is a sensitive function of the electrode potential. The rate
can thus be adjusted over several orders of magnitude until the experimentally
practical time scale is attained.

Figure 1 Bifurcation in the nanoelectrode–nanobubble system. Consider
nanobubbles generated by a reduction reaction, for example, H+ reduction. The relation between the reduction current, iF, and the electrode potential, E, exhibits three distinct regimes: (i) For E higher
than a critical bifurcation potential, Ebif (shown in blue), the formation of nanobubbles is thermodynamically
unfavorable. In this potential range, no nanobubble is formed at the
electrode, and the iF – E relation is single-valued (single branch, solid black
line). (ii) At potentials E < Ebif, the stable dynamical state exhibits a nanobubble
that blocks most of the electrode surface, thus limiting the magnitude
of the reduction current (stable branch, solid red line). If nucleation
of the nanobubble was instantaneous, the iF – E relation would transition smoothly between
branches (i) and (ii). (iii) Nucleation of the nanobubble takes place
at a finite rate. When the potential is switched or swept to E < Ebif, there is a time
interval in which no nanobubble is present at the electrode. The reduction
current is then larger than that in the stable branch at the same
potential since the entire electrode surface participates in the reduction
reaction (metastable branch, dashed black line). This results in a
higher degree of gas supersaturation near the electrode, which in
turns facilitates nucleation. Once nucleation occurs, the system switches
from the metastable to the stable branch (green arrows), where it
remains until the potential is increased to E > Ebif. In practice, the nanobubble nucleation
rate is immeasurably slow near E = Ebif but increases rapidly with increasing current, thus
permitting the experimental observation of nanobubbles.

A Stochastic Process
The feedback-generated
stability of the electrode–bubble system permits characterizing
individual, fully realized nanobubbles and yields detailed information
about their geometry and stability.5,9−12 However, this concept in itself does not elucidate the process by
which nanobubbles are created. The formation of a critical nucleus
which can then grow to form the bubble is a process that occurs on
time and length scales, yet smaller than the nanobubbles themselves;
its direct observation, therefore, represents an additional formidable
challenge. Interestingly, however, single-nanobubble measurements
provide a unique window into the energetics of this process.

In a single-nanobubble
assay, each observed nanobubble corresponds to a single random nucleation
event which can, in principle, occur at any time. A nucleation rate J, therefore, cannot be deduced from a single measurement;
for this, a statistically significant number of events must be averaged.
The resulting experimental distribution of nucleation times contains
additional information beyond the average rate, however.

In
classical nucleation theory, the rate at which a critical nucleus
is formed, J, takes the Arrhenius form: 1  where k is Boltzmann’s
constant, T is the absolute temperature, J0 is the so-called attempt rate (an unknown
constant), and ΔG⧧(c,θ) is the change in free energy to reach the transition
state (a protobubble of critical size that then expands to form the
nanobubble). For a given choice of materials, ΔG⧧ depends on the local concentration of gas molecules, c, and the geometry of the critical nucleus, here characterized
by the (a priori unknown) contact angle θ as
well as assorted materials parameters. In electrochemical generation
at a nanoelectrode, the concentration of gas molecules at the surface
of the electrode, c, is dictated by the rate at which
these molecules are generated by the faradaic process. It is thus
continuously tunable and experimentally measurable during an experiment,
being simply proportional to the faradaic current, iF (that is, c ∝ iF). This means that the barrier height ΔG⧧ is a known function of a single unknown
parameter, the contact angle θ. Rewriting this equation in a
simple form in terms of the parameters of interest yields 2  where A is a (known) single constant that incorporates
material parameters (surface tension, Henry’s constant, diffusion
coefficient of gas molecules) and geometry (electrode radius), while
Φ(θ) is a (known) function of the (unknown) contact angle
θ.

Eq 2 shows
why determining J in itself remains insufficient
to shed light on the underlying microscopic processes: The expression
for J contains two unknown parameters, the attempt
rate J0 and the contact angle θ.
Any assumed value of θ can be accommodated by a different choice
of J0 and neither can be determined from
a single measurement unless we make an assumption about the value
of one of them. But θ, which encodes the geometry and size of
the critical nucleus, represents the main information one can aim
to extract from this experiment, while the attempt rate J0 is notoriously difficult to estimate a priori.

Extracting Quantitative Information
In order to determine
the two independent parameters in eq 2, θ and J0, it is
necessary to measure under two (or more) different experimental conditions
so as obtain independent combinations of the parameters from which
their separate values can be extracted. Eq 2 suggests at least two routes in which this
can be achieved. First, the experiment could be repeated at two or
more temperatures. A complication with this approach is that other
properties, such as the diffusion coefficient of the gas molecules
or the contact angle θ, can also depend on temperature, complicating
the analysis. A far more practical option is to take advantage of
the capability to tune the electrode potential in an electrochemical
experiment and perform measurements at different values of the faradaic
current, iF. This approach was successfully
followed using controlled current (galvanostatic) experiments to measure
the nucleation rate J at several fixed values of iF.13 A drawback,
however, is that the measurement employs nonstandard experimental
biasing schemes and protocols.

A variant on the fixed-current
approach, explored by Edwards et al., is to vary
the electrode potential continuously and to observe the resulting
distribution of nucleation times.4 This
approach reflects a philosophy akin to that of conventional cyclic
voltammetry (CV), in which electron-transfer kinetics and mass transport
are woven into a complex transient current response: Although often
requiring substantial analysis to extract quantitative information,
CV is among the most powerful and versatile tools in the arsenal of
electrochemical methods. Here, the electrode potential is varied continuously
at a rate ν (in V/s), and the distribution of nanobubble nucleation
times is measured. Because the faradaic current changes continuously
over the course of the measurement, a different barrier height is
probed at each instant during the sweep (as sketched in Figure 2), and the resulting distribution
of nucleation times reflects this distribution of barrier heights.
How the events from multiple scans are distributed as a function of
the electrode potential (or, equivalently, the faradaic current or
the surface concentration), therefore, encodes information about how
the shape and height of the barrier varies with the electrode potential.
In fact, because in this particular case the transition-state energy
is simply proportional to Φ(θ), the situation is particularly
straightforward. The attempt rate can be directly extracted from the
relative width of the distribution of nucleation times, following
which the barrier and correspondingly value of θ can be deduced
from the absolute nucleation rate.

Figure 2 (a) The concentration of gas molecules
at the electrode is proportional to the faradaic current, which is
controlled by the electrode potential. (b) The height of the free
energy barrier for nanobubble nucleation, θG⧧, depends on gas concentration and can, therefore,
be tuned via the electrode potential (colors correspond
to arrows in (a)).

A disadvantage of this
approach is that theoretical analysis is required to translate the
distribution of events into a free energy landscape (and hence into
the parameters J0 and θ). This procedure
is not necessarily transparent upon first approach (nor is the shape
of a cyclic voltammogram!). It should, however, be appreciated that
the factors that enter the calculation (nucleation model, assumptions
about geometry, etc.) are identical to those that
enter the (conceptually more straightforward) constant current approach13 and that, given the final equations,4 applying them to the reduction of experimental
data is of comparable complexity in the two approaches. In return,
one reaps the significant benefits of being able to carry out nanoscale
nucleation experiments using the widely accessible workhorse of electrochemistry,
CV. For similar usability reasons, the approach of continuously sweeping
the driving force for extracting nucleation rates has already been
adopted in a variety of experimental systems ranging from superconducting
flux qubits14 to single-molecule biophysics,
where it is known as dynamic force spectroscopy.15,16

Structural Disorder
The stochasticity discussed above has
a fundamental origin, being driven by the thermodynamic energy fluctuations
of a nanoscale system in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir
(constant temperature). A related example is particle number fluctuations
in systems in diffusive equilibrium (constant chemical potential),
which can be observed in electrochemical nanodevices.17 In many SEE experiments, however, disorder often has a
somewhat more prosaic cause: Matter tends to be rough on the atomic
scale, and our ability to synthesize systems with atomic precision
remains limited. Hence, investigations into the properties of, for
example, textured electrodes or single catalytic nanoparticles inherently
deal with distributions of properties across a population. This circumstance
is nicely illustrated by recent results in so-called impact electrochemistry
of nanoparticles18,19 and scanning electrochemical
microscopy.20 It is also reflected in Edwards et al.:4 Although the overall
nanobubble nucleation and stabilization behavior is robust, fluctuations
in the microscopic parameters J0 and θ,
both gradual and abrupt, occur over the course of the measurements.
These changes reflect the evolution of quenched disorder in the structure
of the electrode. This behavior is reminiscent of studies of noise
caused by electrode corrosion,21 but here
on the smallest relevant microscopic scale.

Outlook
Electrochemically
driven nanobubble nucleation is a prototypical example of the possibilities
offered by electrochemistry for studying single-entity, nanoscale
experimental systems. The redox reaction acts as a driving force for
nanobubble generation, provides a feedback mechanism by which the
nanobubble is stabilized, and enables monitoring of the process with
subms time resolution. Statistical analysis of the time evolution
of individual events enables researchers to extract details of the
underlying microscopic dynamics in a way analogous to, for example,
single-molecule biophysical experiments based on optical or force-based
techniques.

A potentially interesting future direction for this
system concerns the dynamical equilibrium that exists after bubble
formation. Once steady state is achieved, a nanobubble covers the
bulk of the electrode, with only a ring with a width of order ca. 1 nm exposed to drive the residual electrochemical reaction
that sustains the bubble. In this regime, any growth or shrinking
of the bubble translates into a sizable change in the measured faradaic
current. This susceptibility could represent a sensitive probe of
the dynamics of the three-phase boundary between an electrode, an
electrolyte, and a gas.
