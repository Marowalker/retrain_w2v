Nanopores bear great
potential as single-molecule tools for bioanalytical
sensing and sequencing, due to their exceptional sensing capabilities,
high-throughput, and low cost. The detection principle relies on detecting
small differences in the ionic current as biomolecules traverse the
nanopore. A major bottleneck for the further progress of this technology
is the noise that is present in the ionic current recordings, because
it limits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thereby the effective
time resolution of the experiment. Here, we review the main types
of noise at low and high frequencies and discuss the underlying physics.
Moreover, we compare biological and solid-state nanopores in terms
of the SNR, the important figure of merit, by measuring translocations
of a short ssDNA through a selected set of nanopores under typical
experimental conditions. We find that SiNx solid-state nanopores provide the highest SNR, due to the large
currents at which they can be operated and the relatively low noise
at high frequencies. However, the real game-changer for many applications
is a controlled slowdown of the translocation speed, which for MspA
was shown to increase the SNR > 160-fold. Finally, we discuss practical
approaches for lowering the noise for optimal experimental performance
and further development of the nanopore technology.

==== Body
Nanopores are promising tools
for biosensing applications and sequencing of DNA and proteins, as
they can resolve single analyte molecules, resolve structural modifications
of molecules, and even discriminate between nucleotide sequences.1−10 The detection mechanism is simple: While passing through the pore,
a (part of a) molecule transiently blocks the ionic current, thereby
inducing a small dip in the current signal, which is detectable by
the electronics (Figure 1). The electrical read-out is carried out by an amplifier, which
senses and amplifies the current signal, followed by a digitizer that
performs the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) of the data. Digital
low-pass (LP) filtering is typically used to reduce the high-frequency
noise and thus improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Such a gain
in SNR comes, however, at the expense of a lower time resolution,
thereby imposing an inherent trade-off.

Figure 1 Fundamental principle
of nanopore sensing. (a) A nanopore separates
two aqueous compartments filled with electrolyte solution (e.g., potassium chloride), and small molecules
(e.g., DNA) are electrokinetically
pulled through the pore by an applied potential. (b) While passing
through the nanopore, the molecule temporarily induces a partial current
blockade which is detected by an amplifier. The signature of a single-molecule
translocation event is generally characterized by the amplitude of
the current blockade, which is proportional to the volume of the molecule
in the nanopore, and by the dwell time, which depends on the electrophoretic
driving force and transient interactions between the passing molecule
and the pore surface.

The detection of analytes
with nanopores thus is, on the one hand,
limited by the ionic current noise which requires LP filtering that
sets a finite operating bandwidth,11,12 but on the
other hand, by the fast speed (typically submilliseconds) at which
molecules translocate through the pore, which conversely requires
a high time resolution for accurate sampling. Various approaches have
been investigated in order to slow down the molecular translocation.
For biological nanopores, a DNA-translocating motor protein (such
as a helicase or polymerase) has been used to slowly feed a ssDNA
strand into a protein pore for DNA sequencing.13−15 For solid-state
nanopores fabricated in thin SiNx membranes16−18 or two-dimensional (2D) materials (graphene,19−21 boron nitride,22−24 molybdenum disulfide25−27), various efforts have been made to either increase
time resolution16,17,28−31 or slow down the translocation process32 by the use of ionic liquids,27 pore surface
engineering,33 mechanical manipulation
with a double pore system,34 optical trapping,35 and sequential DNA unzipping.36 Nevertheless, while fingerprinting approaches have been
developed to detect individual portions of a DNA sequence using dCas9,7,37 streptavidin,38 DNA hairpins,39 or DNA-origami as probes,40 the SNR has not yet allowed de novo DNA
sequencing with solid-state pores. An understanding of the noise sources
that affect nanopore systems and how these govern the SNR is key for
achieving signals wherein molecular structures can be resolved fast
and reliably. Noise characteristics of nanopores have been reported
in various isolated reports, but a systematic overview and comparison
between biological and solid-state nanopores is lacking.

In
this review, we first describe the typical noise sources that
affect the ionic current recordings of biological and solid-state
nanopores, both at low and high frequencies. Next, we compare their
respective performances of various nanopores using ssDNA poly(dT)
translocations as a test system. We assess the SNR under typical experimental
conditions for different protein pores Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (the M2 mutant with a neutral constriction and positively
charged vestibule, subsequently referred to as MspA),41Staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin
(α-HL),42,43Fragaceatoxin C (the mutant of FraC with a positively charged constriction, referred
to as ReFraC),44,45 and SiNx29 and MoS246 solid-state nanopores. We find that biological
pores generally exhibit lower noise (Figure 2a). Nevertheless, solid-state nanopores achieve
the best SNR, largely because of the higher voltages and bandwidths
that such devices can operate at, as compared to biological nanopores.
Finally, we discuss approaches for lowering the ionic current noise
and improving the SNR in biological and solid-state nanopores.

a 1.3 nm diameter solid-state SiNx nanopore
(red) and a 1.4 nm diameter biological α-HL pore (green), performed
at a constant applied bias of 100 mV in 1 M KCl buffer at pH 7 at
a bandwidth of 10 kHz (light) and 1 kHz (dark). α-HL pore was
measured using the typical Montal–Muller approach,47 with a bilayer diameter of ∼100 μm,
as described by Maglia et al.3 The solid-state pore was fabricated on a Si-supported 20 nm-thick
SiNx freestanding membrane using transmission
electron microscopy. Currents through both pores were amplified with
Axopatch 200B. (b) Schematic of the current PSD for a typical nanopore.
Common types of noise are highlighted in the various frequency ranges.

Noise Sources in Nanopores
Noise
refers to any statistical fluctuation of a signal. It can
be characterized by the standard deviation σ or root-mean-square
(rms) variation around the average value as measured over the full
bandwidth B of the signal and by its power spectral density (PSD).
Generally, noise is undesirable, as it can distort or even completely
mask the actual signal. Nanopores typically operate by measuring a
through-pore ionic current that is driven by a constant applied bias
voltage. For the open-pore current measurement, where no analyte molecules
are present, any deviation from the baseline current can be regarded
as noise (Figure 2a).

Understanding the origins of noise is fundamental for optimizing
signal detection. Nanopore systems exhibit a range of different noise
sources.48,49 In Figure 2b, we illustrate the major current noise sources that
affect nanopore systems at different frequencies. Generally, these
can be divided in (i) low-frequency (≲100 Hz) 1/f noise and protonation noise; (ii) shot noise and thermal current
noise (∼0.1–2 kHz), which are both white noise sources
(i.e., frequency-independent); (iii)
high-frequency dielectric (∼1–10 kHz); and (iv) capacitive
(>10 kHz) noise.

In the low-frequency range, 1/f noise (also referred
to as “flicker” or “pink” noise) typically
is the dominant source of noise. Its power decreases with frequency
f following a 1/fβ scaling, with
β ≈ 1. While this type of noise is found in many biological
and physical systems, a fundamental understanding of it is still missing.50 Based on phenomenological evidence, 1/f noise in nanopores has been associated with physical
processes such as slow fluctuations in the number and mobility of
the charge carriers,51−54 nanometer-sized bubbles in the pore channel,55 noise arising from the electrodes,56 mechanical fluctuations of the freestanding membrane (e.g., for 2D materials),23,57,58 and conformational changes in the case of
biological nanopores.59,60 Smeets et al.61 found that Hooge’s phenomenological
formula54 could effectively describe the
1/f noise in solid-state56,61−64 nanopores: 1  where Hooge’s
constant, αH, is an empirical parameter
that quantifies
the magnitude of 1/f noise fluctuations, I the ionic current, and Nc the
number of charge carriers in the pore volume, which was further validated
by follow-up studies.56,62−64 As discussed
below, solid-state nanopores typically feature a relatively pronounced
1/f noise, whose microscopic origin often remains
unresolved. For biological pores, the low-frequency noise is typically
dominated by protonation noise, which is generated by protonation/deprotonation
of ionizable sites within the protein channel.65−67 It can be described
by fluctuations between two different current levels with mean lifetimes
τ1 and τ2 for the protonated and
deprotonated states, respectively, yielding a Lorentzian-shaped component
in the frequency spectrum (for a complete derivation see Machlup et al.):68 2  where Δi is the difference in current between
the two levels, and τ
is the characteristic relaxation time that can be expressed as τ
= τ1τ2/(τ1 + τ2). For α-HL, for example,66 τ was found to be 3.1 × 10–5 s. A distribution
of multiple Lorentzian processes such as in eq 2 can lead to 1/f noise.51 Temporal conformational changes of the pore
channel can also generate conductance fluctuations resulting in 1/f noise. Such a phenomenon, also known as “channel
breathing”, was reported to affect protein pores such as bacterial
porin channels.59,60

In the midfrequency range
(typically ∼0.1–2 kHz),
a frequency-independent white noise is observed that derives from
thermal noise (also known as Johnson–Nyquist noise) and shot
noise. Thermal current noise is fundamental to any dissipative element69,70 and adds to the current noise as 3  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is temperature,
and R the equivalent resistance of the nanopore.
Shot noise, on the other hand, is due to the quantization of charge
and is generated when charge carriers flow across a potential barrier.71,72 Its current-dependent contribution to the noise can be expressed
as 4  where q is
the charge of a single carrier. In practice, shot noise and thermal
noise are comparable in magnitude for the conditions that are typically
used in nanopore experiments.

Another contribution to the nanopore
noise originates from the
loss conductance of the membrane and chip support.48,49 Such dissipation, resulting from dipolar relaxation and charge carrier
migration (details can be found in Chen et al.),73 generates thermal energy causing thermal noise,
also known as dielectric noise.74,75 As this loss conductance
scales linearly with frequency, this noise can be described by 5  where Cchip is the parasitic capacitance, and D a
dissipation factor of the dielectric materials constituting the membrane
and support chip. This source of noise typically dominates in the
2–10 kHz frequency range. To estimate Cchip, one can simply use the expression for a parallel plate
capacitor C = εA/d, where ε is the dielectric constant of the membrane material,
and A and d are the area and the
thickness of the membrane, respectively. For f >
10 kHz, the current noise is determined by the input-referred thermal
voltage noise vn across the total capacitance Ctot at the amplifier input:48,49 6  where vn is the input voltage noise (3 nV/Hz–1 for
the commonly used amplifier Axopatch 200B,76 Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA). Ctot is the total capacitance including the membrane and support chip
capacitance Cchip, the capacitance Camp at the input of the amplifier, and the capacitance Cw of the wiring between the electronics and
the pore. Notably, SI, capacitance has an even stronger, f2, frequency
dependence than SI, dielectric. The total current noise of a nanopore system over its full bandwidth
is the sum of all contributions (Figure 2b), i.e., the sum of eqs 1–6.

Noise in Biological Nanopores
Biological
nanopores are formed by the spontaneous insertion of
membrane proteins into a lipid bilayer, which creates nanopores with
typical diameters ranging from ∼1–4 nm,77 although larger pores with diameters up to ∼40 nm, e.g., the nuclear pore complex,78 are also found in nature. Figure 3a shows a schematic of a standard setup for
measuring the ionic current through such a protein pore. Briefly,
a thick (tens of micrometers) insulating film of amorphous polytetrafluoro-ethylene
(PTFE, or Teflon) separates two liquid compartments and contains a
∼50–100 μm-sized hole where the lipid bilayer
is assembled.3,79 Teflon is the preferred support
material due to the relatively low high-frequency noise and ease of
fabrication.80 Insertion of a protein pore
(Figure 3b) short-circuits
the insulating bilayer membrane and an ionic current between the two
reservoirs can be measured by a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes. The current
signal is amplified by a transimpedance amplifier (e.g., Axopatch 200B) and digitized by an analog-to-digital
converter (ADC, e.g., Axon Digidata,
same supplier). To shield from external radiative electric noise,
the flow-cell and the amplifier headstage are enclosed in a metallic
Faraday cage.3 For biological nanopores,
ionic conductances are typically on the order of 0.1–2 nS.

Characteristic examples of the current PSD for three biological
nanopores (α-HL,42 MspA, and ReFraC44) are shown in Figure 3c, as measured at 1 M KCl, pH 7.5, under
50 mV applied bias. Noticeably, both α-HL and MspA exhibit a
noise plateau at low frequencies (<1 kHz) which is due to protonation
noise, cf. eq 2 for f ≪ 1/τ. The associated PSD is ∼10–4 to 10–3 pA2/Hz, which
is higher than the corresponding white noise of ∼10–5 pA2/Hz, set by the sum of thermal and shot noise, eqs 3 and 4. In the context of single-molecule sensing, protonation noise in
biological nanopores was first investigated by Bezrukov and Kasianowicz
in the mid 1990s.66,67 Spectral analysis of the current
noise of α-HL pores revealed the presence of a Lorentzian-shaped
component at low-frequencies (0.2–2 kHz). Given the strong
dependence on pH (Figure 3d), this noise source was associated with the reversible protonation
of ionizable residues occurring in the α-HL constriction. This
notion was further established in a later work by Nestorovich et al.,65 where the bacterial
porin, OmpF, was shown to produce a similar pH-dependence of the protonation
noise.

ReFraC instead shows a pronounced 1/f noise with
a PSD of ∼10–1 pA2/Hz at 1 Hz,
which is almost three times more than for α-HL and MspA. 1/f noise in biological nanopores was first studied by Benz
and co-workers59,81 and described using Hooge’s
model, eq 1. The low-frequency
fluctuations observed in a family of bacterial porins were associated
with a number of possible phenomena, e.g., gating of the pore channel.59 In later
work by Bezrukov and Winterhalter,60 conformational
changes of the protein pore channel, termed “channel breathing”,82 were discussed as the main cause for the observed
1/f noise.

At higher frequencies (>1 kHz),
the noise in biological nanopores
is dominated by dielectric noise arising from the loss conductance
of the lipid membrane. In fact, since the dielectric loss and dielectric
constant of the Teflon are relatively low (D = (0.8–2)
× 10–4 and εr = 1.89–1.93, respectively), the major contribution to the
dielectric noise is set by the capacitance of the thin lipid bilayer
membrane. This can be attenuated by reducing the area of the Teflon
hole (Figure 3e).80,83 A noise characterization at even higher frequencies (MHz-GHz; above
the experimentally accessible frequency range) was performed using
molecular dynamics simulations based on a comprehensive model of MspA.84

Noise in Solid-State Nanopores
Solid-state
nanopores are generally fabricated in a freestanding
membrane of a solid-state material such as silicon nitride (SiNx),85 graphene,19 hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),86 or molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),46 with thicknesses ranging from ∼0.3 to 30 nm. In
common nanopore chips (Figure 3g), such a membrane is structurally supported by a ∼200–500
μm-thick substrate material, typically silicon(Si),85 glass (SiO2),16 or Pyrex.87,88 Nanopores can be drilled into
the membrane in a variety of ways, e.g., by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM),89,90 focused ion beam milling (FIB),91,92 reactive ion
etching (RIE),93 laser-etching,94,95 or by dielectric breakdown,96,97 resulting in pore diameters
from sub-1 nm to tens of nanometers. In a standard solid-state nanopore
experiment, the chip is sandwiched between two rubber O-rings that
seal two compartments containing the electrolyte solution (Figure 3f). Alternatively,
solid-state pores of ∼5–50 nm size can be made by mechanical
pulling of hollow glass (SiO2) pipettes,98−100 which are
immersed in electrolyte during the measurement. Current sensing, amplification,
and recording is the same as for biological nanopores.

Figure 3h displays
a typical current PSD measured for a 15 nm diameter SiNx solid-state nanopore61 in a 20 nm-thick membrane. Characteristic of solid-state nanopores
is the pronounced 1/f noise that dominates the low-frequency
part of the spectrum (<100 Hz). It can originate from a range of
physical processes, see eq 1 and associated discussion. Smeets et al.55 showed that poor wettability of the pore surface,
associated with the formation of nanobubbles, resulted in high 1/f noise in SiNx. Tabard-Cossa et al.101 discussed that high
1/f noise in SiNx pores
correlates with surface contamination: inhomogeneities of the pore
surface resulted in fluctuations of the number and mobility of charge
carriers due to trapping at the pore surface,63,101 analogous to 1/f noise found in semiconductors.102 As shown by Smeets et al.,61,62 such low-frequency noise in SiNx pores
obeys Hooge’s relation, eq 1, which describes an inverse proportionality between
the 1/f current noise power and the number of charge
carriers present within the nanopore volume (Figure 3i).54 For nanopores
made in 2D materials, the 1/f noise depends strongly
on the size of the freestanding area,22,57,58,103 indicating that mechanical
fluctuations of the ultrathin 2D membrane (thickness <1 nm) are
the main source. The high-frequency noise in solid-state nanopores
is dominated by dielectric (∼2–10 kHz) and capacitive
noise (>10 kHz),16,104 see Figure 3j. The PSD of these noise sources depends
mostly on the capacitance of the chip, cf. eq 5 and 6, which in turn
is set by the membrane and substrate size, thickness, and dielectric
constant. Additionally, parasitic capacitances from the amplifier
and the interconnects between nanopore and amplifier contribute to
the total capacitance at the amplifier input.

Comparing the Performance
of Biological and Solid-State Nanopores
So far, we provided
a general overview of the typical noise sources
in biological and solid-state nanopores. We now turn to a mutual comparison
between these two classes of nanopores. We compare their performances
in terms of the SNR, a more relevant figure of merit than the mere
magnitude of the current noise. We define the SNR as the ratio between
the signal modulation ΔI produced by the translocation
of a ssDNA molecule and the baseline current rms (Irms)
measured at the operating bandwidth (Figure 4a). Although other definitions of SNR are
found in the literature, e.g., as
the ratio between open pore current and baseline current noise Io/Irms105 or the capability to discern current levels
when sequencing DNA,13,41 we find this definition the most
appropriate for the diverse nanopore systems compared in our study.

permission from ref (18). Copyright 2013 American Chemical Society) all in a 1 M KCl solution
at transmembrane voltages of 180 mV, 180 mV, 180 mV, 300 mV, and 1
V and at bandwidths of 30 kHz, 10 kHz, 10 kHz, 10 kHz, and 500 kHz,
respectively. Experiments for biological pores were done using an
Axopatch 200B amplifier, a Teflon-supported lipid membrane (∼50–100
μm wide; DPhPC lipids), 10–30 kHz bandwidth, 1 M KCl,
pH 7.5, and a forward bias voltage of 180 mV, as in ref (106). The solid-state SiNx pore was built on a glass chip and measured
with the VC100 high-bandwidth, low-noise voltage-clamp amplifier (Chimera
Instruments, New York, NY, USA) which allowed for low-noise measurements
at high bandwidth. A broad bandwidth of 500 kHz was required in order
to fully resolve the fast translocations (∼22 μs)18 of poly(dT)30 through the solid-state
SiNx pore. Notably, the positively charged
constriction of ReFraC causes the negatively charged poly(dT)50 to translocate with much slower (491 ± 114 μs)
translocation times compared to MspA (17.7 ± 1.1 μs), which
permitted to filter out more high-frequency noise. (d) Comparison
of various figures of merit for different nanopore systems under typical
experimental conditions. Io indicates
the open pore ionic current at the applied bias V.

Given that the experimental conditions
reported in the literature
differ considerably, we carried out a dedicated comparative study
by complementing reported data with data that were, to the extent
possible, obtained in our lab under the same experimental conditions.
The bandwidth was chosen such as to fully resolve the current blockade
ΔI generated by the poly(dT) substrate (avoiding
a reduced ΔI due to a too narrow bandwidth).
The translocation time, in turn, is determined by a combination of
electrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and interactions between the passing
molecule and the pore surface, which will depend on each individual
nanopore system. The applied bias was chosen as to maximize the current
signal and is limited by experimental conditions, as will be discussed
below. We selected five popular nanopore systems, MspA, a-HL, ReFraC,
MoS2, and SiNx, that are commonly
used and that were shown to possess good spatiotemporal resolution,
allowing for accurate discrimination of short homopolymers.13,27,29,44,107 All pores considered had a similar diameter
of ∼1.3 nm. Figure 4b illustrates the relative sizes of the different pores.

Nanopore experiments probing the translocation of poly(dT)50 were carried out in-house using three biological pores,
MspA, α-HL, and ReFraC. We compared these data to experimental
results on two types of solid-state nanopores, SiNx29 and MoS2,27 that were measured at the same electrolyte conditions.
Translocation data of poly(dT)80 through a 1.4 nm MoS2 pore were kindly shared by the Radenovic lab,46 whereas poly(dT)30 data for a 1.4
nm SiNx pore with ∼5 nm length
were taken from the literature.29Figure 4c shows examples
of single-molecule poly(dT) translocations for the 5 pores. A range
of SNR values are observed, with, at face value, a better performance
for SiNx and ReFraC than for MoS2, α -HL, and MspA.

Figure 4d quantitatively
compares the data for the different nanopore systems. For the biological
nanopores, ReFraC gives the best SNR of 15, while MspA resulted in
a much lower SNR of 4. This is mainly due to the faster translocations
of poly(dT) through MspA, which required a higher bandwidth (30 kHz),
and hence larger noise, in order to resolve the translocation events.
Conversely, translocations through the positively charged constriction
of ReFraC were significantly slower, thus permitting to employ a lower
bandwidth (10 kHz). Among the solid-state nanopores, SiNx showed the best SNR: an impressive value of 37,
which was higher than the SNR of 5 obtained for MoS2, as
well as higher than the values for all biological nanopores. The greater
SNR for SiNx results from the very high
voltage applied (1000 mV vs 300 mV for MoS2), producing a particularly large current signal ΔI. The applied voltage for MoS2 pores was limited by the
degradation of the 2D membrane and pore growth under high bias voltages,
which typically limited the applied bias to <400 mV. In biological
nanopores, the range of bias voltages is limited by the membrane stability,
affected by electroporation and rupture around 200–300 mV.108,109 Note furthermore that the SiNx nanopore
system was operated at a much higher bandwidth (500 kHz vs 10 kHz for MoS2), the regime where dielectric and capacitive
noise dominate. This is advantageous for high-voltage sensing, since
these noise sources do not scale with voltage, cf. eqs 5 and 6. As
a result, the high bias voltage improves the signal (ΔI), while it does not affect the noise. Lastly, we note
that, while MoS2 has a lower SNR than SiNx, it features a better spatial resolution along the molecule,
given its 0.7 nm pore length, as compared to the ∼5 nm of SiNx.

Finally, it is important to point
out that the above comparison
was carried out for voltage-driven translocation of DNA through nanopores.
A controlled slowdown of the translocation speed can change these
numbers dramatically. Indeed, despite the fact that Figure 4d shows that the best SNR was
obtained for the solid-state SiNx nanopores,
with values exceeding those of biological nanopores, todays commercialized
nanopore-based DNA sequencers employ protein pores to read off DNA
bases with (sub)-nucleotide resolution over very long reads.15,110 Using a helicase to slow down ssDNA molecules through MspA, allowed
Laszlo et al.41 to use
a very low LP filter frequency of ∼200 Hz and fully resolve
the stepwise DNA translocation at half-base resolution. By comparing
the noise at a 200 Hz bandwidth with the signal obtained for voltage-driven
poly(dT) translocations in our experiments, we find an exquisite SNR
of ∼650 for MspA – 2 orders of magnitude higher than
the SNR = 4 noted above. Applying the same reasoning to α -HL
and ReFraC increases their SNR to ∼270 and ∼220, respectively, i.e., somewhat lower values, consistent
with their higher low-frequency noise compared to MspA (Figure 3c). Thus, in the context of
DNA sequencing, the real game-changer lies in the enzymatic control
over the translocation speed by use of an additional motor protein.13,15,41,107,111 For solid-state nanopores, despite
the progresses in slowing down the DNA translocation,27,32−36 time control has so far remained a challenge, and accordingly, DNA
sequencing has not yet been realized with such nanopores. Furthermore,
mechanical instability of solid-state nanopores over time, which particularly
affects smaller pores, should be minimized in order to achieve sufficiently
long observation times.

Approaches To Overcome Noise Limitations
Figure 5 shows important
approaches to lower the ionic current noise in nanopores. We first
describe efforts to reduce the low-frequency noise. As protonation
noise is the main source of low-frequency noise in biological nanopores,
it is advantageous to choose a pH value that is far away from the
pKa of the ionizable amino acids to attenuate
the noise. Another way to reduce it, is to remove charged amino acids
near the constriction site, which is expected to yield lower noise
levels. Furthermore, increasing the conformational stiffness of biological
pores can help to reduce conductance fluctuations associated with
channel breathing.

Figure 5 Approaches to reduce the noise in nanopore systems. For
biological
nanopores, low-frequency protonation noise can be minimized by adjusting
the pH far from pKa of the amino acids
in the pore constriction, as reported in ref. (66) or by mutating the ionizable
amino acids (Arg, Lys, Asp, Glu) to neutral ones (e.g., Asn), as was done for MspA. Reprinted with
permission from ref (106). Copyright 2008 National Academy of Sciences. Low-frequency 1/f noise instead can only be avoided by selecting a pore
that is mechanically stable under an applied bias, e.g. MspA or α-HL. High-frequency noise can
be minimized by reducing the size of the freestanding lipid membrane
by, e.g., employing a nanocapillary
as a support (reprinted with permission from ref (123). Copyright 2011 American
Chemical Society) and by reducing the capacitance of the interconnects
by smart CMOS integration (reprinted with permission from ref (105). Copyright 2013 American
Chemical Society). For solid-state nanopores, low-frequency 1/f noise can be reduced by coating the surface with a hydrophilic,
homogeneous material, e.g., Al2O3, as reported in ref (115). For 2D-materials, 1/f noise
can be suppressed by lowering the area of the freestanding 2D membrane.

noise can be minimized by employing dielectric chip substrate materials, e.g. glass or by tight integration of the

For solid-state nanopores, the
low-frequency 1/f noise can be efficiently suppressed
by surface functionalization
of the SiNx nanopore with a hydrophilic
surface layer, such as Al2O3 or SiO2.112−115 In principle, any surface treatment that reduces the amount of contaminants
and improves hydrophilicity of the pore surface will lower the 1/f noise. Indeed, Tabard-Cossa et al.101 showed that piranha treatment (30% H2O2/H2SO4, 1:3) substantially reduced
the 1/f noise by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Beamish et al.116 demonstrated that cyclic
application of high electric fields to the nanopore also suppressed
this noise source. Similar to protein pores, work from Wen et al.56 showed that the 1/f noise could be minimized by choosing a pH that is far
from the isoelectric point of the nanopore material (∼5 for
Si3N4).117,118 Nanopores built with
2D materials suffer from pronounced 1/f noise that
was found to correlate with the area and thickness of the freestanding
2D membrane.47,48 A decrease of the freestanding
area was shown to reduce the 1/f noise, while employing
multilayer membranes was also helpful for obtaining less noise, though
that approach is less desirable due to a loss of spatial resolution.23,57,58 Use of freestanding 2D membranes
that are directly grown on a SiNx-supporting
membrane was also shown to lower the 1/f noise for
both graphene119 and MoS2120 pores, as compared to transferred 2D membranes.19,57

The noise at higher frequencies, constituted by dielectric
and
capacitive noise, has a well-characterized physical origin, namely
the thermal voltage noise in conjunction with the loss conductance
of the membrane and substrate materials as well as the amplifier input
capacitance. Suppression of dielectric noise is generally achieved
by minimizing the capacitance Cchip and
dielectric loss D of the chip, cf. eq 5. To effectively decrease capacitive
noise, the total input capacitance Ctot needs to be reduced, see eq 6 and related discussion. In biological nanopores, the high-frequency
noise can be reduced by decreasing the area of the lipid bilayer.
Mayer et al.80 fabricated
Teflon holes of only ∼25 μm in diameter with soft lithography
using SU-8 resist as master mold, providing a Cchip of 10–28 pF. By using a U-shaped Teflon patch tube
as the support, Akeson and co-workers83,106 built horizontal
bilayers <20 μm in diameter. Lipid bilayers with a comparable
size were also created with the droplet-interface-bilayer (DIB) technique.121 Kitta et al.122 reported on the fabrication of yet smaller bilayers, with
sizes down to 2–3 μm in diameter, by using a heated tungsten
tip to create a microhole across the Teflon film.

Similarly
sized 1–3 μm bilayers can be obtained by
inserting protein pores into giant unilamellar vescicles (GUVs) and
using patch-clamp pipets to measure the conductance of the pores.124,125 More recently, Gornall et al.123 showed that borosilicate glass nanopipets with diameters
as low as 230 nm could be fabricated and used for current recordings
on an OmpF protein channel. Hartel et al.126 achieved high-bandwidth (>500 kHz) recordings
with biological pores with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS)-suspended membranes that were built directly over a ∼30
μm well on top of a CMOS-amplifier chip. This offered a reduction
of the total input capacitance Ctot to
<4 pF and provided a bandwidth as high as 1 MHz and a SNR >
8 at
500 kHz, for detecting the gating of a RyR1 pore (type 1 ryanodine
receptor).126 Combined with extended β
distribution data analysis127 (which exploits
the characteristics of the excess current noise to reconstruct the
true current signal), it was possible to achieve a time resolution
of 35 ns.126

For reducing the high-frequency
noise in SiNx solid-state nanopores, an
established method, first reported
by Tabard-Cossa et al.,101 is to lower Cchip by coating the area
of the chip around the pore with a dielectric, e.g. PDMS, thereby providing additional thickness to the chip
membrane surrounding the pore and thus a low series capacitance. Similarly,
a substantial reduction of Cchip was achieved
by employing a dielectric, e.g.,
amorphous glass16,17 or Pyrex23,88 as substrate material instead of the commonly used crystalline silicon
which is intrinsically conductive. In work by Balan et al.,17 glass chips were shown to reduce Cchip to <1 pF, compared to >300 pF for
standard
silicon chips.61 Similarly to biological
nanopores, the highest working bandwidths were so far achieved by
integrating a low Cchip nanopore device
with an on-chip CMOS-amplifier,28,30 which lowered the total
input capacitance to Ctot ≈ 4 pF.
In this way, ssDNA molecules were recorded using ultrathin (<4
nm) sub-2 nm pores yielding a SNR > 10 at 5 MHz.30 In 2D nanopores, the high-frequency noise can be addressed
in similar ways to SiNx pores. The use
of glass as substrate material, combined with a small ∼300
nm freestanding 2D-membrane of graphene or MoS2, resulted
in a Cchip < 2 pF.17

Conclusions
In this paper, we illustrated the main
sources of noise affecting
various nanopore systems, with a particular emphasis on comparing
biological and solid-state nanopores, and we discussed practical approaches
to lower the noise. We compared the SNR of poly(dT) translocations
through a representative set of biological and solid-state pores and
found that silicon nitride nanopores gave the highest SNR. This can
be attributed to the higher currents (i.e., larger signals) that solid-state systems offer and to the relatively
low high-frequency noise. Despite these good noise characteristics,
prominent applications such as DNA or protein sequencing have so far
remained out of reach for solid-state nanopores, because the fast
translocation speed provides only a short observation time per single
molecule. There are two ways to improve this: One can either shift
the sampling rate into even higher frequencies (≫MHz) or alternatively
slow down the translocation of the molecule. The latter strategy has
led to the successful commercialization of DNA sequencers based on
protein nanopores that are coupled with an enzymatic stepping motor.
In our comparison, we found that the SNR of MspA increased >160-fold
by such speed control, mainly due to the decoupling of the signal
from the high-frequency noise. Additionally, the motor protein provides
a ratcheting mechanism that translocates the substrate with a constant
discrete step size. Since the sensing region of the pore is typically
larger than the individual monomer size (nucleotide or amino acid),
such a mechanism is indispensable to reproducibly resolve and identify
the sequence. Future improvements of the solid-state nanopore system
could thus be directed toward either a further increase of the temporal
resolution, e.g., by reducing even
more the overall parasitic capacitances, or by creating an efficient
slowdown mechanism, similar to biological nanopores. In general, the
understanding of noise sources, associated time scales, and techniques
to lower the noise at both low and high frequencies are greatly beneficial
to maximize the sensitivity of nanopore detection and thereby extend
the range of its applications.
