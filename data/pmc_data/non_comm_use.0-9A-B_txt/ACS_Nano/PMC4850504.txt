Spin-dependent
photoluminescence (PL) quenching of CdSe nanoparticles
(NPs) has been explored in the hybrid system of CdSe NP purple membrane,
wild-type bacteriorhodopsin (bR) thin film on a ferromagnetic (Ni-alloy)
substrate. A significant change in the PL intensity from the CdSe
NPs has been observed when spin-specific charge transfer occurs between
the retinal and the magnetic substrate. This feature completely disappears
in a bR apo membrane (wild-type bacteriorhodopsin in which the retinal
protein covalent bond was cleaved), a bacteriorhodopsin mutant (D96N),
and a bacteriorhodopsin bearing a locked retinal chromophore (isomerization
of the crucial C13=C14 retinal double bond was prevented by
inserting a ring spanning this bond). The extent of spin-dependent
PL quenching of the CdSe NPs depends on the absorption of the retinal,
embedded in wild-type bacteriorhodopsin. Our result suggests that
spin-dependent charge transfer between the retinal and the substrate
controls the PL intensity from the NPs.

==== Body
In the last
few decades, the
combination of biosystems and nanostructures has been applied to produce
new photonic and electronic devices.1−3 Owing to the special
properties of the biosystems, like structure recognition, self-assembly
abilities, and complex responses to light, new hybrid biodevices may
be used to express novel functions, those that are not available in
the common solid-state photonic/electronic devices. Purple membrane,
which includes bacteriorhodopsin (bR), is perhaps one of the most
promising biosystems that has been explored for photo/electronic applications.4−6 The present work focuses on the optical and spintronic properties
of bR, an integral membrane protein in the purple membrane (PM) of Halobacterium salinarum, which is usually found as two-dimensional
crystalline patches. The retinal, imbedded inside bR, absorbs light
(at about 570 nm), which triggers a photocycle including several intermediates,
which leads to pumping of protons across the membrane from the internal
cytoplasm to the external medium. As a result, a proton gradient is
generated that is used for ATP synthesis in the cell.7,8 The proton transfer within PM is accomplished by charge separation
followed by de- and reprotonation of the retinal.9 Note that the retinal is located at the center of the PM, i.e., 2.5 nm from both sides of the PM
surfaces.1 Relevant to this work is the
realization that this distance is smaller than the typical Förster
radius (5 nm) in energy-transfer processes.10

Excitonic interactions in nanobiohybrid structures based on
semiconductors,
nanoparticles (NPs), and photochromic biomolecules including bR and
green fluorescent protein (GFp) were observed before.1,2 This phenomenon is associated either with fluorescence quenching,
fluorescence enhancement, or nonradiative energy transfer from NPs
(donor) to the retinal (acceptor) and is commonly related to the Förster
resonance energy-transfer (FRET) process.3 This process is sensitive to the distance between donor and acceptor
and can be modulated by the size of the NPs,11 irradiation intensity, structure, and morphology of the biosystem.12 Besides these extrinsic parameters, properties
inherent to the NP-Bio system such as dipole–dipole interactions13 and chirality14,15 play a significant
role in the overall photoluminescent (PL) behavior of such a hybrid
system. It is also known that pure sources of spin-polarized electrons
contribute to the spin-dependent PL in semiconductor16 and spin-dependent exciton formation in a π-conjugated
system.

Recently, spin-dependent electron transport through
wild-type (WT)
bacteriorhodopsin (WT bR) was reported.17 This phenomenon has been attributed to the chirality of the protein
and is another manifestation of the chirality-induced spin selectivity
effect.18,19 In a sequential work it was also demonstrated
that the degree of spin polarization can be controlled by light.20

In the present work, we investigated the
PL from CdSe NPs that
are adsorbed on a PM that contains bR.1 The hybrid system, NPs, and the PM are deposited on ferromagnetic
Ni-alloy (see the Supporting Information (SI)). We demonstrate that the PL intensity strongly depends on
the direction of magnetization of the ferromagnetic substrate. By
investigating the system with modified bR, we are able to conclude
that the alternation in the PL intensity is controlled by spin-specific
electron transfer from the substrate to the retinal, which consequently
affects the efficiency of energy transfer between the NPs and the
retinal.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 schematically
presents the experimental system in which a PM that includes bR is
adsorbed on a ferromagnetic substrate (Ni- alloy) and CdSe NPs are
adsorbed to bR on top of the membrane (see SI). The CdSe NPs’ absorption peak is at 630 nm. Circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy performed on the adsorbed membrane confirms that
the helical structure of the proteins in bR is retained when the membrane
is adsorbed on the Ni-alloy surface and that the CD spectra are identical
to those observed in our former studies.17 A well-defined absorption band centered at ∼570 nm confirms
that retinal is covalently attached to the WT bR and its mutant (D96N)
(see the SI, Figure S1). This observation
is consistent with the proteins not being significantly altered. Emission
spectra of the adsorbed bR were also measured and confirm the intact
structure. In order to adsorb the NPs to bR, CdSe NPs were dissolved
in toluene, and the samples containing bR were immersed in this solution
for 3.5 h. Afterward, the samples were sonicated for 20 s to remove
the excess and weakly bound NPs. To confirm that the structure was
not disturbed, we compared the emission spectra of bR on Ni-alloy
before and after it was suspended in toluene for 3.5 h (see SI Figure S5). In addition, the absorption band
at 570 nm indicates that immersing the bR multilayer in toluene does
not disturb the bR structure. The disappearance of the absorption
band at 570 nm for apo membrane bR indicates that the retinal–protein
covalent bond was cleaved, and therefore it can be used for the control
experiment (see SI Figure S1). In order
to confirm the surface coverage, atomic force microscopic measurements
were carried on drop-casted WT-bR and APO-bR. The results show that
the surface coverage is almost 100%, and the data confirm that these
drop-casted bR on the surface always form multilayer (see SI, Figure S2). The orientation of bR membrane
on the substrate was studied in our previous work, and it was found
that the membrane is deposited such that the more negative side is
facing the substrate.20

an experimental setup for measuring PL. A
hybrid structure containing semiconductor nanoparticles (CdSe) of
∼6–7 nm diameter, which are adsorbed to the bacteriorhodopsin
(either WT, APO, mutant, locked retinal, or reconstitute), imbedded
in a PM which is deposited on a Ni-alloy surface. Magnetic field (field
strength ∼0.5T) is applied normal to the surface of the sample
while measuring the PL spectra.

Figure 2 PL spectra of CdSe NPs on WT-bR with two different magnetic field
directions (H ∼ 0.5T). Inset shows the maximum
effect obtained for WT-bR.

To elucidate the effect of spin-dependent fluorescent, we
recorded
the PL spectra with the magnetic field applied normal to the Ni-alloy
surface in two opposite directions. Figure 2 shows the PL spectra from hybrid NPs-bR
(WT) recorded with the magnetic field applied up (↑H) and down (↓H). A clear change
was observed with an average peak-to-peak ratio of the PL spectra
for two directions of the magnetic field of 1.4(±0.1):1 (down:up).
The results represent the average over five different sets of samples,
when the maximum ratio observed was 2.5:1 (inset in Figure 2).

In principle, the
magnetic field-induced change in the PL intensity
may result either from variation in the rates of the energy transfer
or the charge transfer. In order to verify the contribution of the
charge transfer, we performed contact potential difference (CPD) measurements
that are sensitive to the work function (Φ) of the sample. When
the sample is illuminated and charge transfer occurs, a surface photovoltage
(SPV) is developed with a shift in the work function of the material.
Details of the measurements and instrumentation are given in ref (21).

Figure 3 SPV (ΔCPD) of WT
bR deposited on Ni-alloy surfaces with and
without CdSe nanoparticles illuminated in two different wavelengths
and the control for the bare Ni-alloy substrate.

Figure 3 presents
the SPV signal observed for a PM containing WT bR, with and without
NPs. The two columns on the left show the SPV signal (the change in
the CPD signal upon illumination) when the sample was illuminated
at 532 nm (green light). The amount of charge transferred as a result
of the illumination is almost constant with and without CdSe NPs, i.e., the amount of charge transfer from NPs is negligible,
and most of the charge transfer occurs between the WT-bR and the surface.
The positive sign of the signal indicates hole transfer from the retinal
to the substrate. In order to confirm this conclusion, SPV measurements
were performed with illumination at 630 nm (red light). The purpose
of using red light was to monitor the charge transfer with negligible
retinal excitation (630 nm should mostly excite the CdSe NPs). Indeed,
when the experiment is performed with red light, there is almost no
response to the light (i.e., when
the SPV signal is low, charge transfer between the NPs and the surface
is negligible, as shown in Figure 3). Therefore, this result suggests that the PL intensity
from the NPs is mainly affected by the energy-transfer rate, and variation
in the energy-transfer efficiency should account for the observed
magnetic field. Since the energy-transfer rate itself should not be
spin dependent and therefore cannot depend on the sign of the magnetic
field, we assume that there is a cooperative effect leading to the
magnetic field-dependent PL. Namely, there is a charge-transfer process
between the retinal and the magnetic substrate, which is magnetic
field dependent. The charge transfer affects the efficiency of energy
transfer between the NPs and the retinal; hence it affects the PL.
Therefore, the magnetization of the substrate “gates”
the energy transfer from NPs to the retinal by controlling the charge
transfer from the retinal to the substrate. The validity of the proposed
model will further be strengthened by the results described below.

To pinpoint the role of the retinal chromophore as the intermediate
in the process, we have modified the WT bR structure by site-directed
mutagenesis to form the D96N mutant. Details on the modifications
were published elsewhere.15 Experiments
similar to those that led to the results in Figure 2 were repeated for a CdSe NPs-bR (D96N) hybrid
structure and no effect of the magnetic field could be observed (Figure 4A). Moreover the
PL signal is stronger than in the case of WT bR, indicating that there
is no efficient energy transfer.

The lack of a magnetic field
effect, in the case of the mutant,
is accompanied by an inefficient charge-transfer process, as observed
in the SPV experiment (Figure 5). The SPV signal is about −50 mV vs about −30
mV obtained with the bare substrate. Here we observed negative values
which indicate electron transfer from the NPs and not positive values
(hole transfer), as was observed in the WT bR. Since in the mutant
the M photochemically induced intermediate is accumulated, the retinal
in the bR mutant dark state cannot be excited, and the lack of a magnetic
field effect suggests that retinal excitation is essential for quenching
the fluorescence of the NPs.

normal or antinormal
to the surface for various mutations of the retinal. (A) Mutant (D96N),
(B) APO bR, (C) locked retinal, (D) reconstituted bR.

As another control, magnetic field-dependent studies
were performed
on apo bR, which lacks the retinal–protein covalent bond, leading
to absorption at 360 nm instead of 570 nm in the WT bR. Hence, the
retinal should not be able to accept any energy transferred from the
NPs. Indeed, Figure 4B shows no change in PL intensity upon changing the direction of
the magnetic field. This observation proves that the excited retinal
plays an important role in the observed effect. In this context, SPV
data for an apo bR-modified surface with and without CdSe NPs (Figures 5) show an inefficient
charge transfer both between the CdSe NPs and the surface and between
the retinal and the surface (the low response that was observed may
come from a small portion of bR in which the retinal is still bonded
to the protein).

surfaces
illuminated at 533 nm.

For additional verification of the role of the retinal in
the magnetic
field-controlled PL, the external magnetic field-dependent PL process
was studied with two other modified bR forms. The first is an artificial
pigment derived from a synthetic “locked retinal” in
which the retinal has been modified such that isomerization around
the crucial C13=C14 double bond is prevented
(see Methods). The second is a reconstituted
bR to evaluate the effect of mere bleaching and retinal reconstitution
processes. In the first case, no change in the PL intensity was observed,
as a function of the direction of the magnetization of the substrate
(Figure 4C), whereas
for the reconstituted bR, a clear difference in PL intensity was found
(Figure 4D). However,
the intensity ratio (up:down = 1.2:1) is smaller than for WT bR, and
the sign of the magnetic field effect is reversed.

The existence
of the effect in the reconstituted bR indicates that
the absence of the effect in the locked artificial pigment is a property
of the pigment itself and does not originate from the reconstitution
process. The switch in the sign of the signal may result from some
structural changes in the reconstituted bR versus the WT. In recent
studies it was found that structural changes may affect the sign of
the spin preferred in the electron transfer.22 Finally, the effect of the direction of the magnetic field on the
PL was monitored on a sample containing only WT bR without NPs (see SI, Figure S3). No effect of the magnetic field
was found.

To probe the importance of simultaneously exciting
the NPs and
the retinal, we conducted the experiments on WT bR with NPs using
488 nm light. At this wavelength, the absorption of the NPs is higher
than at 514 nm; however, the retinal absorption is much weaker. A
significant change in the PL intensity was found (see SI, Figure S4); however, the intensity ratio
(down:up = 1.15:1) is smaller than in the case of illumination at
514 nm. This observation can be explained only if the effect involves
a cooperative mechanism and it cannot be explained by simple spin-dependent
charge transfer between the NPs and the surface.

Based on extensive
experimental work with several modified forms
of bR, we propose the following mechanism (see Scheme 1) for the observed magnetic field-controlled
PL. It assumes that after irradiation at 514 nm, both CdSe NPs and
the retinal are excited, and subsequently energy is transferred from
the excited CdSe NPs to the excited retinal. Furthermore, it is assumed
that energy transferred does not occur from the excited CdSe NPs to
the retinal ground state. If the excitation of the retinal is followed
by the photocycle, no energy transfer can occur from the NP to the
retinal all through the photocycle time. A competitive process involves
electron transfer from the magnetic substrate to the excited retinal.
This process prevents the retinal excited state to isomerize and to
initiate the regular bR photocycle. In our previous work, we found
that electron transmission through WT bR is spin specific.20

Figure 6 Difference in the fluorescence intensity for a magnetic
field of
the substrate pointing up versus down, as a function of the laser
intensity. The results are fitted to the intensity square with R = 0.95.

Since the electron transfer
between the substrate and the retinal
is spin selective, the direction of magnetization of the substrate
defines its rate. If the substrate is magnetized so that it has a
substantial density of populated states of the correct spin, namely,
the spin that can be transferred from the substrate to the excited
retinal through the chiral protein, then the electron transfer from
the surface to the retinal is efficient, and the retinal is quenched
to its ground state so that it can absorb a photon again and form
the excited state to which energy transfer can occur. On the other
hand, if the substrate is magnetized in the opposite direction, the
electron transfer from the substrate to the retinal is blocked, due
to the very low density of the populated states having the correct
spin, and the retinal excited state continues to its regular photocycle.
Consequently the time it takes for the retinal to return to its ground
state is longer, reducing the probability for multiple retinal excitation
and therefore reducing the probability for energy transfer from the
NPs to the retinal.

In short, the mechanism we propose assumes
that for observing efficient
energy transfer from the NP to the excited retinal, the excited retinal
has to be quenched fast so as to be ready for reabsorption of photon.
The return of the retinal to its ground state can be hindered by the
photocycle process or by the slow electron transfer from the substrate,
when it is magnetized in the “wrong” direction.

The proposed model is based on two photons that must be absorbed
by the system simultaneously. Figure 6 indeed indicates that this effect depends on the intensity
square.

Scheme 1 Process Leading to Magnetically Controlled PL from the CdSe
NPs
(A) The system consists of
a ferromagnetic substrate (gray on the right) on top of which a PM
that includes bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is deposited. CdSe NPs are adsorbed
to the bR. Commonly upon excitation of bR with green light, a photocycle
is initiated by isomerization of the retinal chromophore. (B) In the
system studied, the same light also excites the NPs. (C) If the ferromagnetic
substrate is magnetized so that spins can be injected from it into
the chiral bR, following photoexcitation of the bR, an electron will
be transferred to the hole in the excited bR, the retinal will be
quenched to its ground state so that it can absorb a photon again
and form the excited state to which energy transfer can occur, and
the PL signal will be reduced. (D) In the case that the magnetic substrate
is magnetized so that the spin transfer to the excited retinal is
slower, the retinal excited state will complete its lifetime, and
the regular photocycle will take place, reducing the probability for
multiple retinal excitation and therefore reducing the probability
for energy transfer from the NPs to the retinal.

The strong effect of the magnetic field observed can be rationalized
by the short lifetime of the excited retinal (about 0.5 ps) versus
that of the excited NPs (ns). Hence, the retinal can be excited many
times within the lifetime of the NP, and therefore the probability
for energy transfer from the NPs to the retinal is enhanced by up
to a factor of 2000.

The model presented above is confirmed
by studying the systems
that contain bR with various modifications. In the D96N mutant, the
M intermediate is accumulated, following photoexcitation, and therefore
there is no retinal in the excited state that can accept energy from
the NPs, and the retinal does not return to its ground state. The
same holds for the apo system. The lack of an effect in the “locked”
system also indicates that the effect is associated with the lifetime
of the retinal excited state. Since retinal isomerization is prevented
in the locked pigment, its excited lifetime is prolonged from 0.5
ps (WT) to 20 ps,23,24 and therefore the probability
of the retinal to return to its ground state increases, and it can
be excited multiple times so that efficient energy transfer from the
NPs to the retinal can occur at both directions of the magnetic field.

Conclusion
Our results indicate a system in which spintronic properties control
PL. In the hybrid NP-bR structure, the chirality of the protein induces
spin-dependent electron transfer from a magnetic substrate to the
retinal moiety, inside the bR. This electron transfer depends on the
direction of the substrate’s magnetization. The electron-transfer
process “gates” the energy transfer from the excited
NPs to the excited retinal.

Absorption Spectra
The absorbance
spectra were measured
on a HP 8453 UV–vis spectrometer, and the CD spectra of bR
films were measured on a Chirascan spectrometer, Applied Photo Physics,
England.

Surface Photovoltage (SPV) Measurements
SPV measurements
were used to quantify the amount of photo-induced charge transfer
in these assemblies. CPD measurements provide the work function (Φ)
of the sample by measuring the electric potential between the sample
and a reference plate. When the sample is illuminated and charge transfer
occurs, a SPV is created; i.e., a work function shift
occurs. Based on the SPV measurements, it is possible to determine
the direction and the extent of the electron transfer (for a given
illumination intensity) between the NPs and the substrate. If an electron
is transferred from the NP layer to the substrate, the surface’s
work function decreases, whereas the work function increases if electrons
are transferred in the opposite direction. Thus, the sign of the SPV
signal provides the direction of electron transfer, and its magnitude
is proportional to the change in the work function resulting from
the light-induced dipole moment that arises from charge transfer between
the NPs and the substrate.

Photoluminescence (PL) Measurement
The PL measurements
were carried out by using a LabRam HR800-PL spectrofluorimeter microscope
(Horiba Jobin-Yivon). Typically, 514 nm laser light (argon-ion CW
laser at ∼15 mW/cm2) has been used for excitation
of CdSe NPs. The incident light was impinged on the surface at an
angle 90° to the sample surface. Prior to collecting the PL spectra,
an area (typically, 20 au × 20 au) and number points (25 points)
within this area were defined in order to map the surface. Afterward,
the PL spectra were collected using a microscope (with a 5× high-working
distance lens). During the measurement, a confocal aperture (1100
μm) was fully opened, and the integration time was maintained
at 15 s. Finally, the spectra were presented after averaging out the
PL of individual points within the defined area at two different magnetic
orientations. The external magnetic field dependence on the PL of
the CdSe NP assembly, connected to the magnetic substrate via bR,
was investigated at room temperature.
