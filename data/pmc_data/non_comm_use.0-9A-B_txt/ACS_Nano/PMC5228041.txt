Self-motile
Janus colloids are important for enabling a wide variety
of microtechnology applications as well as for improving our understanding
of the mechanisms of motion of artificial micro- and nanoswimmers.
We present here micro/nanomotors which possess a reversed Janus structure
of an internal catalytic “chemical engine”. The catalytic
material (here platinum (Pt)) is embedded within the interior of the
mesoporous silica (mSiO2)-based hollow particles and triggers
the decomposition of H2O2 when suspended in
an aqueous peroxide (H2O2) solution. The pores/gaps
at the noncatalytic (Pt) hemisphere allow the exchange of chemical
species in solution between the exterior and the interior of the particle.
By varying the diameter of the particles, we observed size-dependent
motile behavior in the form of enhanced diffusion for 500 nm particles,
and self-phoretic motion, toward the nonmetallic part, for 1.5 and
3 μm ones. The direction of motion was rationalized by a theoretical
model based on self-phoresis. For the 3 μm particles, a change
in the morphology of the porous part is observed, which is accompanied
by a change in the mechanism of propulsion via bubble
nucleation and ejection as well as a change in the direction of motion.

==== Body
Named after
the ancient Roman
God Janus, micro- or nanosized particles with an architecture of different
physical and/or chemical properties over regions of the surface have
been widely explored in various areas of science and technology. Typical
Janus “motors” have two distinct faces, at least one
of which is “active”, i.e., catalyzes chemical reactions in the surrounding solution, which
leads to self-propulsion. Such motile particles are envisioned to
enable multiple, break-through applications. For instance, autonomous
Janus motors have been used as an active cargo delivery system to
transport microparticles1,2 and small molecules3−6 as well as active micro/nano platforms for environmental applications.7

While there are many methods to fabricate
Janus motors,8,9 the most common one is deposition,
by sputtering or electron-beam
(e-beam) evaporation, of a chemically active material, e.g., Pt, onto a monolayer of spherical particles
made of silica, polystyerene, etc.10 The reverse process of covering the surface of a chemically
active particle with an inert material11−13 or surface functionalization
of chemically active moieties onto one face of an inert Janus particle14,15 has also been employed as methods of fabrication for Janus motors.
In addition to the well-known catalytic combination of Pt/H2O2, many other inorganic chemical reactions, such as MnO2/H2O2,16 Al/H2,17 Mg/H2O,12 and Ir/N2H4,18,19 have been utilized in the design of Janus motors. Biocatalytic reactions
triggered by enzymes have been explored recently as a means of achieving
propulsion of Janus motors.3,6,20

Various mechanisms to convert chemical energy into motility
of
active colloids have been reported. Bubble propulsion, which can be
easily identified by visible gas bubbles detaching from the active
side of the motors,11,21−23 is one important
mechanism for larger motors, i.e., with characteristic size of tens of micrometers. As the motors’
size decreases to a few micrometers, bubble propulsion is seldom reported;
in this size range, most of the Janus motors exhibit some form—diffusio,
electro, electrochemical—of self-phoresis.10,24,25 Although this class of mechanisms was intensively
studied in the past decade, recent debates in the literature highlight
a number of interesting questions on the self-phoretic motion, which
are yet to be answered.24,26−28 If the size of the active particle is further decreased toward submicrometer
scale, any directionality of the motion is lost due to fast rotational
diffusion, and the particles exhibit enhanced diffusion.4,13,29

Here, we report on the
development of a mSiO2-based
hollow, spherical Janus motors with “reversed” Janus
structure, in that the catalytic layer (Pt) is placed inside the hollow particles, and thus the catalytic reaction takes place
only inside the cavity as well, in contrast to conventional Janus
motors (see Scheme 1). By using polystyrene (PS) particles of different sizes as starting
templates in the fabrication procedure, we successfully control the
size of the motors from 500 nm up to 3 μm. We observed size-dependent
motility behavior (see Scheme 1): enhanced diffusion for 500 nm particles; directional phoretic
motion toward the nonmetallic side for 1.5 and 3 μm particles,
which is rationalized via theoretical modeling; and
bubble propulsion toward the metallic side for 3 μm particles,
for which a change in the morphology of the porous structure of the
motor is also noticeable. These Janus motors with catalytic reactions
inside the motors’ body have the advantage that the whole external
surface is available for functionalization, compared to conventional
Janus motors where only half of the external surface is available.
Furthermore, being made out of mSiO2, the surface can be
easily functionalized with various moieties, and therefore they can
act as versatile active micro/nanoplatforms in applications such as
environmental remediation and active drug delivery. Via theoretical modeling and analysis, we have shown that the directional
motion of the reversed motors, in the absence of bubbles, is compatible
with a self-phoretic mechanism. These findings contribute to a better
understanding of self-phoresis and to the design and fabrication of
other new types of chemically powered micro/nanomotors.

Janus Motors and of the Various Motility Scenarios
Results and Discussion
We start
by succinctly describing the fabrication method. Layers
of Pt (10–15 nm) and SiO2 (2 nm) are sequentially
deposited on a monolayer of (template) PS, spherical particles, yielding
typical Janus particles, as depicted in Scheme 1. (SEM images of Janus PS particles of three
different sizes after Pt deposition (JPS-Pt) are presented in in Figure S1.) Subsequently, the whole surface is
encapsulated, using sol–gel chemistry, by a mesoporous silica
(mSiO2) shell; a typical outcome is shown in Figure 1a,b. Due to the different surface
properties, hydrophilic SiO2 and hydrophobic PS, the mSiO2 shows a different growth morphology on the two sides. The
mSiO2 shell coated on the Pt hemisphere (metallic side)
has a uniform and smooth surface with a thickness of about 50 nm (inset
of Figure 1b). However,
the mSiO2 coated on the PS hemisphere (nonmetallic side)
has a rough surface consisting of aggregated small mSiO2 particles. In the final step of the fabrication, the PS template
is removed by dissoving it in dimethylformamide (DMF). In this way
we successfully obtain mSiO2-based reversed Janus motors,
in which the Pt hemisphere (black color) is embedded inside the hollow
mSiO2 shell (Figure 1c) (Pt is black, on the left). We noticed relatively large
pores/gaps, with a diameter of up to 50 nm, at the nonmetallic side
(inset of Figure 1c),
which would allow relatively unhindered diffusion of molecular species,
such as H2O2 and O2, between the
solution inside and outside the shell. In contrast to conventional
Janus motors, where the Pt is on the outside of the surface, here
the H2O2 decomposition takes place inside the
hollow cavity, acting as internal “chemical engine”
for the motile Janus particles.

coefficient of the nanomotors at various concentration of H2O2. The results in (d and e) are calculated as an average
over 10 independent trajectories at each fuel concentration; the error
bars represent the standard error of the mean.

The self-propulsion of the nanosized motors (500 nm diameter)
was
characterized by optical microscopy observation (see Experimental
Section in the SI). Automatic tracking
and calculation of mean-square-displacement (MSD) at different time
intervals (Δt) was accomplished by a self-developed
code based on Python (Figure S2). For the
small particles, the rotational diffusion coefficient of the symmetry
axis of the particle Dr = τr–1 = kBT/(8πμR3), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, μ is the viscosity of the solution,
and R is the radius of the nanomotors, is large (note
the dependence on 1/R3); therefore, the
nanomotors have a small characteristic reorientation time τr = 0.092 s at 22 °C, the ambient temperature at which
the experiments have been carried out. Typical examples of the motion
of the nanomotors without (Video S1) and
with (Videos S2 and S3) fuel, respectively,
are provided in the Supporting Information (SI). Due to the rapid reorientation of the symmetry axis of the
motile colloid, the active nanomotors are expected to exhibit enhanced
diffusion, but very weak, if any, directional motion.4,13 This is indeed what our experiments show, in that the MSD depends
linearly on time, and its slope increases with increasing concentration
of fuel. The effective diffusion coefficient Deff is extracted from the slope of the linear dependence as
MSD = 4DeffΔt (assuming
the motion to be two-dimensional, corresponding to trajectories in
the focal plane under optical observation).10,30 The diffusion coefficient in the absence of fuel is 0.69 ±
0.02 μm2 s–1; this value is slightly
lower than the theoretical expectation of 0.86 μm2 s–1 following the Stokes–Einstein equation D = kBT/(6πμR). The dependence of Deff on
fuel concentration, summarized in Figure 1d, shows an increase from the Brownian diffusion
value (0.69 ± 0.02 μm2 s–1) in the absence of fuel to 1.10 ± 0.04 μm2 s–1 (at 3 wt % H2O2), 1.31
± 0.05 μm2 s–1 (at 5 wt %
H2O2), and 1.49 ± 0.05 μm2 s–1 (at 10 wt % H2O2), respectively.

We now turn to the case of the larger particles of about 1.5 μm
diameter. In spite of large pores and gaps at the nonmetallic side
(Figure 2b,c), the
micromotors maintain an overall spherical shape. Due to their size,
these micromotors have a rotational diffusion time of the symmetry
axis τr = 2.48 s, which is significantly larger than
the relaxation time of the chemical composition of the solution around
the colloid by diffusion. In this case, directional self-propulsion
of the micromotor (1.5 μm) is observed (Figure 2d), and the MSD curves now show the corresponding
parabolic shapes at short times (Figure 2e).10,29,30 The dependence of the velocity on the fuel concentration shown in Figure 2f) further argues
for a mechanism of motion involving the catalytic decomposition of
H2O2. The velocity V of the
micromotor was calculated directly from the ratio between the length L of the trajectory during a known time period t and the time t. Alternatively, the velocity V can be estimated by fitting the parabolic part of the
MSD with 4DΔt + V2Δt.10,30 The values
thus obtained are similar to the ones directly calculated as above.
Snapshots along a typical trajectory are presented in Figure 2d) (see also Video S4). As shown in the inset of the first panel, from
these optical observations we can identify the direction of the motion
to be toward the nonmetallic side. Since typical, compact core SiO2/Pt or PS/Pt Janus spherical micromotors (1–2 μm)
also move toward the noncatalytic part of the Janus structure, this
observation raises the possibility that the catalytic reaction actually
occurs at the external surface of the Pt hemisphere, via diffusion of the fuel and product species through the very narrow
nanochannels of the smooth mSiO2 shell covering the Pt
film (inset of Figure 1b). To test this possibility, we have used motors without removal
of the PS core, which thus do not have the “cavity”
available for reactions. When such motors are suspended in 5 wt %
H2O2 solution, we have not observed either indications
of H2O2 catalytic decomposition or motion of
the particles (Video S5). Therefore, we
rule out this possibility and conclude that the motion is due to chemical
reactions occurring inside the cavity of the particle. Further discussion
of this case, including a theoretical analysis that provides an explanation
for the motility and the direction of motion, is presented below.

Janus micromotors (1.5 μm). (a) Schematic illustration of the
motion, assumed to occur by some type of self-phoresis, of the micromotor.
(b) SEM of the micromotor and (c) TEM image of the nonmetallic side

% H2O2. Inset: the micromotor moves toward the
porous part. The red spot is a label automatically assigned by the
tracking software. (e) MSD (average) as a function of the time interval
(Δt) and (f) the corresponding average velocity
of the micromotor at different fuel concentration. The results in
(e and f) are calculated as average over 10 independent trajectories
at each fuel concentration; error bars show the standard error of
the mean.

By using larger PS particles (about
3 μm) as templates, micromotors
with a different morphology of the nonmetallic side are obtained:
Instead of a shell with quasi-uniform porosity, now the motor has
a shell with one large hole (Figure 3a,b). For this type of micromotor, we observe, at the
same fuel concentration (10 wt % H2O2), either
phoretic motion or bubble propulsion; snapshots from typical trajectories
are shown in Figures 3c,d) (Videos S6 and S7, respectively).
The red arrows indicate the location from where the bubbles are released.
The coexistence of two mechanisms of motion can be explained by the
fact that formation of bubbles depends not only on the O2 concentration reaching the nucleation threshold but also on the
surface morphology, the roughness of the pore orifice at the nonmetallic
side, and whether the rest of the shell is porous or not (which influences
the probability for nucleation due to significantly changing the interior
O2 concentration that is “funneled” toward
the “hole”). On the other hand, the phoretic mechanism
remains operational independently of these factors.

images of Janus micromotors (3 μm). (c, d) Schematic illustration
of the motion mechanism, and snapshots along a typical trajectory,
of micromotor (3 μm) undergoing (c) directional phoretic motion
at 10 wt % H2O2 (motion toward the nonmetallic
side) and (d) bubble propulsion at 10 wt % H2O2 (motion away from the nonmetallic side).

In line with previous reports on bubble propulsion, we have
observed
that under similar concentrations of fuel the velocity of micromotors
moving by bubble propulsion is significantly larger (by a factor of
10 in the current experiments) than in the case of phoretic motion.
Motion by bubble propulsion can be promoted by adding a surfactant, e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 0.5
wt %) to the solution. Upon addition of SDS, we observed very fast
velocities of micromotors driven by bubble propulsion (Figure S3 and Video S8), up to about 500 μm s–1; at the same time,
the phoretic motion was completely suppressed, an effect previously
reported31 but yet to be conclusively explained.
We note that for the smaller micromotors (1.5 μm), where the
porous structure of the shell is missing the “funneling”
large hole, addition of SDS did not lead to bubble propulsion.

We rationalize the directed motion exhibited in the absence of
bubble formation by using a simple model of a chemically active colloid
and of motion by self-phoresis. The model bears similarities with
several studies previously shown to capture qualitatively the phenomenology
exhibited by such systems.10,32

The particle
is modeled as a spherical shell of radius R (see Figure 4a) suspended in a
Newtonian liquid solution of viscosity μ.
Part of the shell, in the form of a spherical cap of opening angle
θ0 ≅ 90°, is porous (dotted gray line),
while the rest is compact and smooth (solid gray line). Due to the
porous structure, the solution fills the particle interior. We assume
that all molecular species in the solution can diffuse (with a reduced
diffusion constant) through the pores. On the inside of the compact
part there is a thin layer of (Pt) catalyst (solid black line). The
catalytic decomposition of peroxide at the Pt side is modeled as a
source of a solute molecule A (in this case O2), which releases A molecules with a uniform
rate Q per area of catalyst. The solute molecules
diffuse in solution with diffusion constant D. The
steady-state motion of the particle with velocity V = Vez (see Figure 4a) is force- and
torque-free (since there are no external fields acting on the particle
or on the fluid); furthermore, in the range of velocities that are
observed experimentally and in the absence of bubble formation, the
flow of the solution is in the low Reynolds number regime, and the
diffusion of the molecular solute is dominant over advection, i.e., the Péclet number of the solute
is small.

(scaled by C0) of solute molecules (color
coded) inside (left legend) and outside (right legend) the particle.
(c) Flow of the solution (streamlines) in the fixed (laboratory) system

(d) The velocity of the particle (scaled by V0) as a function of the ratio br of phoretic mobilities (see the main text) for various
values of the porosity para meter k and slip-lengths
(specifying the strength of the interior/exterior hydrodynamic coupling),
as given in the main text. (Also see the main text for the definitions
of C0 and V0.)

At steady state, and under the
assumption that the rotational diffusion
of the particle is slow compared to the relaxation of the distribution
of solute by molecular diffusion, the density c(r) of solute molecules (in the fixed system of coordinates,
shown in Figure 4a),
which is chosen such that it is centered at the instantaneous position
of the center of the particle) is the solution of the Laplace equation
∇2c(r) = 0 subject
to appropriate boundary conditions. These are (i) on the catalyst
covered region, the current of solute molecules along the normal (into
the particle) direction equals the production by the source: −D∂nc = Q; (ii) vanishing current along the direction
of the normal into the particle over the smooth silica part; (iii)
over the porous part, the outgoing (at the cavity side of the porous
shell) solute molecules current equals the one outgoing at the outside
of the porous shell; the magnitude of this current at the point rP on the porous region is assumed to be proportional
to the difference in density across the porous shell, i.e., J(rP) = K[ci(rP) – co(rP)], where ci,o denotes the
density of solute on the inside and the outside of the particle, respectively.
The phenomenological parameter K (units of velocity)
is a measure of the porosity of the shell: for small values of K, the density of solute on the outside of the shell is
much smaller than that on the inside, while for large values of K the two densities are comparable. Physically, K is bounded by the fact that transport of solute molecules
through the porous shell cannot be faster than transport through free
solution. For a thin shell with thickness δ, an upper bound
for K can be estimated as Kmax = D/δ. The diffusion problem outlined
above can be solved in the standard way via a series
representation of c(r) in spherical
coordinates (see SI). In Figure 4b we show an example of solute
density distribution c(r) in units of
the characteristic density C0 := Q R/D for k = 0.1, where
the dimensionless porosity parameter k := K R/D.

Due to the effective interaction
of the solute molecules with the
surface of the colloid, the gradients in solute density along the
surface of the particle give rise to stresses in the fluid and thus
to hydrodynamic flow.33 Over the nonporous
surfaces (the Pt covered one and the compact, smooth silica part),
these interactions are accounted for by a so-called “phoretic
slip” hydrodynamic boundary condition on the surface of the
particle; i.e., us = −b∇c at
the surface, with the phoretic mobility b < 0
(b > 0) for repulsive (attractive) interactions,
respectively.33 The parameter b can take different values over the surface, bPt and bSi; based on previous studies,32 we expect both of them to be negative and the
ratio br = bSi/bPt < 1.

The role played by
the porous part of the surface in the hydrodynamics
of the solution distinguishes two scenarios of motion. The first possibility
is that it effectively insulates the hydrodynamic flows inside and
outside of the shell. In this case, the model maps directly into self-diffusiophoresis
of the whole shell plus the solution contained inside. This is driven
by the distribution of solute on the outside of the shell, the phoretic
mobility bSi on the compact (smooth) silica
part, and the hydrodynamic boundary condition specifying the tangential
component of the flow velocity over the porous part. (The assumption
of a hydrodynamically insulated interior implies that the radial component
of the flow velocity vanishes at all points on the shell.) For simplicity,
we assume that over this porous part, an effective phoretic slip boundary
condition, characterized by a mobility bpor, holds; this parameter is expected to satisfy bpor < 0 and |bpor| <
|bSi|, since the porous matrix is silica.
Irrespective of the value of bpor within
those limits, we obtain V < 0. This is opposite
to the direction of motion observed in the experiments, which conclusively
argues against this mechanism as a potential explanation of the experimental
observation.

We therefore consider in detail a second possibility:
While the
porous shell prevents a significant radial flow between the inside
and the outside, it still allows for transmission of tangential stress
from the inside to the outside of the porous shell. This “spilling-into”
scenario has been extensively studied in the context of flow over
porous walls, and we model it here as an effective hydrodynamic slip
boundary condition34 for the hydrodynamic
flow v(r) over the porous part:33vt(i,o) = −(λ(i,o)/μ)σrθ(i). Here σrθ denotes the rθ component of the stress tensor σ of the
Newtonian liquid and the minus sign is due to the fact that the normal
to the inner surface of the shell is opposite to the unit vector of
the radial direction (see SI). Here the
slip-length parameters λ(i,o) have rather the meaning
of a “leakage depth” of the flow from inside to outside.
In the following, we set them to the values 100 nm (the inside) and
50 nm (outside), since for the mechanism to be operational, the inside
value is expected to be larger than the thickness (δ ∼
50 nm) of the porous shell, while the outside is expected to be smaller
than the inside by about δ. We note that these values are not
special, in that we have obtained the same phenomenology described
below for a range of values λ(i) ≥ 90 nm.
The (i) phoretic slip and the hydrodynamic slip boundary conditions,
together with (ii) the requirement of vanishing radial flow on the
surface of the shell, (iii) the rigid translation of the particle
with velocity V, (iv) vanishing flow far away from the
particle, (v) incompressibility of the flow, and (vi) force free motion
of the particle, completely specify the solution of the Stokes equations
(i.e., the flow) and the velocity V of the particle; the details of the calculation are provided in
the SI. In Figure 4c we show an example of hydrodynamic flow
inside and outside a porous particle which moves with a positive (i.e., toward the nonmetallic side) velocity V/V0 ≅ 0.06 (where V0:= |bPt|C0/(2R)), corresponding to the
slip-length values noted above and to br = 0.1.

Once the slip-length parameters are fixed, the velocity
depends
only on the values of k and 0 ≤ br ≤ 1. As shown in Figure 4d, while the dependence on k is rather weak (note, though: under the assumption that the solute
remains dissolved and no bubbles are formed), the magnitude and, most
importantly, the sign of the velocity depend on the value of br. Previous studies32 indicate that small (<0.3) values of this ratio are required
in order to capture the emergence of wall-bound steady states of motion
for compact (i.e., not porous) silica-Pt
particles. In that same range of br values,
our model predicts motion of the porous particle toward the nonmetallic
side, which is in agreement with the experimental observations. This
feature provides a welcomed self-consistency check of the model.

Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated, studied experimentally, and theoretically
modeled a spherical micro/nanomotor with reversed Janus structure.
This consists of a mesoporous silica spherical external shell and
a catalytic Pt hemisphere embedded inside the hollow cavity. The porous
structure at the nonmetallic side of the motors provides the means
for chemical species exchange with the surrounding solution such that
the catalytic decomposition of peroxide inside the particle can power
self-propulsion. Motors of different diameters (500 nm, 1.5 μm,
and 3 μm) exhibit distinct types of motion: enhanced diffusion,
phoretic motion, and either bubble propulsion or phoretic motion,
respectively. The motion by self-phoresis, as well as its direction,
has been rationalized by developing a theoretical model which accounts
for the chemical reactions taking place inside the cavity and coupling
of the hydrodynamic flows inside and outside the cavity.

In
addition to the flexibility in the type of motion, these micro/nanomotors
have the whole external surface made of mesoporous silica, and thus
they can be readily modified with versatile functional moieties. Such
features promote the Janus motors with reversed structure in the position
of promising candidates for active micro/nanoplatforms capable of
fulfilling on-demand tasks, such as environmental remediation or active
drug delivery, in liquid environments.

Materials
Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 99%), triethanolamine
(TEOA, 99%), cetyltrimethylammonoium bromide (CTAB, 99%), ethanol
(>99%), 2-propanol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (K-30, > 99.5%), 2,2′-azon-bis(isobutyronitrile)
(AIBN, 98%), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride
(V-50, 97%), styrene, and dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%) were purchased
commercially.

Instruments
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured by a Zeiss
ULTRATM 55 SEM machine at 5 kV and a Zeiss EM 912 TEM machine, respectively.
An electron beam evaporation (e-beam) system was used to deposit Pt
and SiO2 layer. Optical videos were taken by inverted Leica
optical microscopy with 63× air objective.

PS (450 nm)
Synthesis
First, polyvinylpyrrolidone (K-30,
> 99.5%) was dissolved in 395 mL water under vigorous stirring.
Then,
40 g styrene was added into the K-30 solution under stirring. The
mixture solution was stirred for 30 min under argon atmosphere before
slowing heating up to 70 °C. After the temperature was stabilized,
10 mL aqueous solution containing 0.6 g 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)
dihydrochloride (V-50) was added in to the mixture solution to initiate
the polymerization process. The formed PS particles were collected
by centrifugation and washed with deionized (DI) H2O and
ethanol. The particles were suspended in ethanol for further use.

PS (1.5 and 3 μm) Synthesis
Typically, we dissolved
K-30 (1 g) into a mixture solution of iso-propanol (89 mL) and DI
H2O (10 mL) under vigorous stirring. Then, 2,2′-azon-bis(isobutyronitrile)
(0.34 g) was dissolved in styrene (10.4 g) and added into the previous
solution. After stirring under argon atmosphere for 30 min, the solution
was heated up to 70 °C to initiate the polymerization process.
PS (3 μm) was prepared by tuning the amount of K-30 (1.5 g).
The formed PS particles were collected by centrifugation and washed
with DI H2O and ethanol. The particles were suspended in
ethanol for further use.

Janus PS Particles Preparation
The
ethanol suspension
containing PS particles were treated by sonication for 5 min. The
particles suspension (90 μL) was dropped onto a clean glass
slide (50 mm diameter) that was treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min
beforehand. The glass slide was air-dried, and a monolayer of PS particles
would form. A thin layer of Pt (10–15 nm) and SiO2 (2 nm) were sequentially deposited onto the monolayer of PS particles via e-beam evaporation. The Janus particles thus formed
were collected by sonication and suspended in DI H2O.

Reversed Janus Micro/Nanomotors Preparation
The Janus
PS particles collected were further suspended in a mixture solution
containing DI H2O (2 mL), CTAB (7.5 mg), and TEOA (4 mg).
The mixture was sonicated for 5 min and heated up to 80 °C under
stirring. Then, TEOS (10 μL) was added into the solution, and
the mixture solution was kept at 80 °C under stirring for 2 h.
The mesoporous silica-coated Janus PS particles thus formed were collected
by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and DI H2O. Then,
the PS core was removed by washing the particles with DMF. The PS
template was dissolved and removed by repeating the washing process.

Optical Microscopy Observation and MSD Analysis
The
movement of the micro/nano motors was observed by inverted optical
microscopy (Leica) with 63× air objective. Aqueous solution containing
the micro/nanomotors were placed on a clean glass slides containing
varied concentrations of H2O2. Each video (up
to 30 s long) was recorded with a CCD camera at a frame rate of 20
fps. Tracking of the micro/nanomotors were performed by using a home
developed code based on Python using the OpenCV library. After obtaining
the tracking trajectory of each nanomotors with corresponding coordinates
(x, y), the MSD was calculated as
MSD (Δt) = ⟨∑{i=x,y}[ri(t + Δt) – ri(t)]2⟩ (corresponding
to a two-dimensional motion). By varying the time interval Δt, one obtains the functions MSD (Δt) shown in the various figures in the main text and SI.
