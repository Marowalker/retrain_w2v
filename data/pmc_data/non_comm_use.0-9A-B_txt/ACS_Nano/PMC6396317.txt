Rapid, inexpensive,
and sensitive detection of bacterial pathogens
is an important goal for several aspects of human health and safety.
We present a simple strategy for detecting a variety of bacterial
species based on the interaction between bacterial cells and the viruses
that infect them (phages). We engineer phage M13 to display the receptor-binding
protein from a phage that naturally targets the desired bacteria.
Thiolation of the engineered phages allows the binding of gold nanoparticles,
which aggregate on the phages and act as a signal amplifier, resulting
in a visible color change due to alteration of surface plasmon resonance
properties. We demonstrate the detection of two strains of Escherichia coli, the human pathogens Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae, and two
strains of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris. The assay can detect ∼100 cells with no cross-reactivity
found among the Gram-negative bacterial species tested here. The assay
can be performed in less than an hour and is robust to different media,
including seawater and human serum. This strategy combines highly
evolved biological materials with the optical properties of gold nanoparticles
to achieve the simple, sensitive, and specific detection of bacterial
species.

==== Body
The rapid
detection of specific
bacterial species has many potential applications in medicine and
environmental and food safety.1,2 Conventional methods,
including culturing, ELISA, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods,
have important drawbacks, such as long processing times and the need
for specialized equipment.3,4 Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
are an ideal candidate for rapid biosensing based on the sensitivity
of the surface plasmon resonance to aggregation state, which produces
a visible color change. AuNPs also have other advantages, including
high surface area to volume ratio and facile surface modification.5,6 Indeed, antibody-conjugated AuNPs have been used to detect pathogenic
bacteria in multiple systems.7−11 However, the isolation and production of antibodies can be costly
and nontrivial, and optimization may be required to improve stability
and solubility in the relevant context. Therefore, AuNP-based technology
utilizing a different molecular mechanism for targeting is desirable.

The high-affinity, high-specificity interactions that characterize
antibodies are the result of intense evolutionary pressure on molecular
recognition between host and pathogen. A similar selective pressure
has driven the long-term evolution of tight interactions between receptor-binding
proteins (RBPs) of bacteriophages and receptors on bacterial host
cells. For example, the effective affinity of phage M13 for its bacterial
host (F+E. coli) is reported to be <2
pM.12 The breadth of host range depends
on the phage, but phages can be specific to a bacterial species or
strain.13 Phage RBPs are therefore an interesting
potential source of affinity reagents for bacterial detection.

Phages have been studied previously for pathogen detection because
they are less expensive to produce and more stable to storage and
assay conditions compared with antibodies.14 Phage-based assays include infection of the host cells causing expression
of a phage-encoded reporter gene15−17 and phages labeled with
fluorescent or enzymatic tags.18−22 Phage proteins conjugated to a gold surface have been used to capture
bacteria and detect the changes in surface plasmon resonance.23,24 However, compared to the AuNP-based approach described here, these
detection modalities require extended time and equipment, which may
not be available in certain settings (e.g., point-of-care
or field work).

Here, we combine the AuNP detection modality
with chimeric phages
that display the RBP of a phage that naturally targets the desired
bacterial species. In this approach, the capsids of chimeric phages
are thiolated, and the phages are incubated with the bacteria. The
attachment of phages to bacteria and subsequent aggregation of AuNPs
on the capsid leads to a colorimetric signal (Figure 1). M13 was used as the phage scaffold, on
which RBPs from other filamentous phages (genus Inovirus) were displayed. Use of a scaffold phage rather than native phage
is desirable because most phages are poorly characterized, posing
difficulties for propagation and protocol standardization. In contrast,
high titers of M13 derivatives can be readily produced in Escherichia coli and handled downstream. Members of Inovirus infect a variety of Gram-negative genera of medical
and agricultural interest, including Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Yersinia, and Neisseria.25 The RBP, or minor coat protein, pIII,
consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain of pIII (encoded by
g3p-N) attaches to the primary host receptor (e.g., the F pilus for the Ff phages, such as M13), while the C-terminal
domain interacts with a secondary host receptor and aids cell penetration.26 The replacement of g3p-N by a homologous domain
switches attachment specificity to the corresponding host in at least
two cases.27,28 We extend this strategy to additional Inovirus members and thiolate the resulting chimeric phages
for interaction with AuNPs. This strategy demonstrates rapid and specific
detection of two strains of E. coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and two strains
of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris with
a detection limit of ∼100 cells. We first describe validation
of this technique using thiolated M13 phage to aggregate AuNPs to
detect E. coli. We then describe the generalization
of this strategy to use RBPs from five other filamentous phages, allowing
the targeting of their respective host species or strain.

Figure 1 Scheme for
chimeric phage detection of bacterial species. (a) M13
phage (gray) is engineered to express a foreign receptor-binding protein
(blue circle) fused to the minor coat protein pIII, and the chimeric
phage is thiolated (yellow) through EDC chemistry. (b) Thiolated chimeric
phages are added to media containing bacteria (blue rectangle) and
may attach to the cells. Centrifugation separates cell-phage complexes
from free phage. The pellet is resuspended in solution with gold nanoparticles
(red), whose aggregation on the thiolated phage produces a color change
(purple).

Results and Discussion
The phages
are chemically modified by thiolation to generate an
interaction with AuNPs. Each major capsid protein (pVIII) of the M13
scaffold contains at least three solvent-accessible carboxylic amino
acids at the N-terminus (Glu2, Asp4, and Asp5), which can be potentially
modified by EDC chemistry under mild conditions. As a proof of concept,
the wild-type M13KE phages were thiolated with cysteamine to detect E. coli ER2738 bacteria. The concentration of chemically
incorporated thiol groups was quantified with Ellman’s assay,
while the concentration of phage particles was determined by real-time
PCR. Thus, we estimated that the chemical modification led to the
addition of ∼1800 thiol groups per virion (Table S1). This level is consistent with a substantial fraction
of the phage coat being modified (∼2700 copies of pVIII per
virion).29 Attenuated total reflection
Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis further confirmed the
presence of thiol groups on the phage after modification (Figure 2a). In addition,
the ζ potential of the phage is expected to increase upon thiolation
due to the masking of Glu and Asp residues. Indeed, the ζ of
unmodified M13KE phage in water was measured to be −44.3 mV,
while that of the thiolated M13KE phage was −10.31 mV. These
results support the successful functionalization of the phage.

(2550 cm–1) and C–S stretching (659 cm–1) signals. Shown are cysteamine (black), phage before
modification (red), and phage after modification (blue). Representative
TEM images of wild-type M13KE phage (b) before and (c) after thiolation
indicate little change in gross morphology. (d) TEM image of AuNPs
shows homogeneous particles of ∼4 nm diameter.

To check the gross morphology of thiolated M13KE
virions, we measured
their hydrodynamic behavior by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The
effective diameter of the wild type phage showed little change after
modification (Figure S1). Normal virion
morphology and lack of agglomeration30,31 was also verified
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2b,c). Another potential concern was that
thiolation of pIII might interfere with binding to the host cell because
there may be solvent-accessible carboxylic amino acids (e.g., Glu2 and Glu5) on pIII.32 The thiolated
M13KE phage was tested for attachment to host cells expressing a cyan-fluorescent
protein.33 The virions were labeled with
a fluorescent dye FITC through thiol–maleimide click chemistry
and purified. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min to allow
for attachment, the sample was visualized by confocal microscopy.
The fluorescence of the modified phages was found to be in close proximity
to the cell surfaces (Figure S2). Thus,
thiolated phages exhibit normal morphology and retain the ability
to bind host cells. Furthermore, the dissociation constants (Kd) of wild type M13KE and thiolated M13KE for E. coli (F+) were found to be similar (see Figure S3 and the Supporting Methods), indicating that thiolation
did not substantially perturb attachment to host cells.

Citrate-stabilized
AuNPs were synthesized and verified by TEM to
have a diameter of ∼4 nm (Figure 2d). DLS showed a relatively monodispersed
population centered at diameter ∼8 nm (Figure S4). The apparent size difference is reasonable considering
the difference in hydration state and the intensity-based weighting
of the DLS data. The ζ potential of the AuNPs in water was found
to be −45.1 mV, indicating a highly negatively charged surface,
intended to stabilize the colloidal particles in solution.34

To test the assay principle using thiolated
M13KE phage with AuNPs
for detection of E. coli, varying concentrations
of E. coli ER2738 were diluted into tap water and
incubated with the phage for 30 min. The cells (with attached phages)
were washed twice and then resuspended in a solution containing AuNPs.
In the absence of bacteria or in the presence of unmodified M13KE,
a red solution is obtained, consistent with the color of the un-aggregated
AuNPs in solution. The aggregation of AuNPs on thiolated phage, indicating
the presence of E. coli, was observed by a change
in the absorbance spectrum, resulting in a purple solution easily
observed by the naked eye (Figure 3). This assay can detect as few as 60 CFU cells (Figure S5). Therefore, the limit of detection
is on the order of ∼102 CFU, indicating the high
sensitivity of the present technique. Similar sensitivity is seen
when a more-concentrated solution of AuNPs is used (Figure S6). While this aggregation-based assay is not suitable
for creating a standard curve with a large dynamic range (Figure S7), a dilution series of a sample could
be used to obtain a rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the concentration
of a specific bacterial species. In particular, the dilution at which
the number of cells becomes less than ∼100 could be identified
and used to infer the concentration of the original sample. To characterize
the interaction, TEM images were obtained for the mixtures (Figure S8). Large aggregates containing AuNPs
and thiolated phages were observed in samples containing thiolated
phages and E. coli cells but were absent when unmodified
M13KE was used. Attachment of AuNPs to free bacteria was not observed
by TEM, consistent with electrostatic repulsion given the negative
zeta potential of AuNPs and E. coli (ζ = −8.88
mV, measured here). The phages are also negatively charged (ζ
= −10.31 mV, measured for thiolated M13KE), so AuNP association
with the phages is driven by the Au–S interaction despite electrostatic
repulsion. It should be noted that free filamentous phage do not pellet
at the centrifugation speeds used to pellet the cells and cell–phage
complexes. Overall, in this assay, unbound virions were removed and
the AuNPs aggregated on the thiolated phages attached to the host
bacteria, resulting in a visible color change.

AuNPs. (a, c) Digital photos and (b, d) UV–vis spectra are
shown. From left to right in panel a, samples contain AuNPs and: no
bacteria or phages (black line in panel b), unmodified M13KE with
106 CFU E. coli (red line in panel b),
and thiolated M13KE with E. coli at 102, 104, and 106 CFU (blue, magenta, and green
lines, respectively, in panel b). From left to right in panel c, samples
contain AuNPs and no bacteria or phages (black line in panel d), unmodified
M13KE phage and ∼1 or ∼10 CFU of E. coli (red or blue lines in panel d, respectively), and thiolated M13KE
phage and ∼1 or ∼10 CFU of E. coli (magenta
or green lines in panel d, respectively).

The robustness of a bacterial detection platform in different
media
is an important consideration for potential applications. To test
this, thiolated M13KE was incubated with E. coli in
seawater and human serum with the remaining steps carried out as described
above. Incubations in all media yield a detectable colorimetric response
to the presence of E. coli (Figures 4 and S9). E. coli can survive in seawater for several days, similar to survival in
freshwater.35−38 The change in absorption spectrum for samples incubated in human
serum was less pronounced than that for the different samples of water.
Given that human serum contains a complex mixture of proteins and
other macromolecules,39,40 it is possible that some of these
components might interfere with the interaction among bacteria, phage,
and AuNPs. Nevertheless, the color change of AuNPs on phages is still
visible even in this complex media.

or (c, d) human serum. (a, c) Digital photos and (b, d) UV–vis
spectra are shown. From left to right in panels a and c, samples contain

102, 104, and 106 CFU (blue, magenta,
and green lines, respectively, in panels b and d).

Having validated the technique to detect E. coli, we then engineered phages capable of recognizing
pathogenic bacterial
species. We cloned chimeric phages using a derivatized M13 genome
as a scaffold to display the RBP from five other filamentous phages:
CTXϕ, If1,41,42 ϕXv,28 ϕLf,28 and Pf143 (Table 1). In each case, the RBP gene of M13 (g3p-N) was replaced
by its known or putative homologue from the other phage. The RBP sequences
were adjusted for codon bias in E. coli but were
used without other optimization. Successful construction was verified
by restriction digestion and sequencing (see the Supporting Information). The resulting phages were produced
in E. coli cells after transformation. The chimeric
phages (M13-g3p(CTXϕ), M13-g3p(Pf1), M13-g3p(ϕLf), M13-g3p(ϕXv),
and M13-g3p(If1)) were thiolated (Table S1) and used to detect their respective host bacteria in tap water,
seawater, and human serum. The thiolated chimeric phages showed comparable
sensitivity to detect their host bacteria compared to M13KE with F+E. coli (Figures 5 and S10–S14). The limit of detection
in all cases was ∼102 CFU, demonstrating the adaptability
of this approach to targeting different bacterial species and strains.

The corresponding chimeric phage (Table 1) was used in each
case. Shown are digital photographs (left) and UV–vis spectra
(right). Left column: from left to right, samples contain AuNPs and
no bacteria or phages (black line in right column), unmodified phage
with 106 CFU host bacteria (red line in right column),
and thiolated phage with host bacteria at 102, 104, and 106 CFU (blue, magenta, and green lines, respectively,
in the right column).

Because the specificity of detection is important for identifying
bacteria, each of the six phages (M13KE and the five chimeric phages)
was tested for its ability to detect the hosts of the other phages.
No shift of SPR peaks in the UV–vis spectrum was observed in
any case (Figure 6),
indicating little cross-reactivity within the group of Gram-negative
organisms tested. This is likely a reflection of the specificity of
the source phages themselves. We also tested whether detection by
individual phages was affected in a heterogeneous mixture of bacteria
[E. coli (F+), V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa]. The red-shift of SPR peaks
only occurred when the bacterial mixture contained the host cells
targeted by the phage [M13KE, M13-g3p(CTXϕ), or M13-g3p(Pf1),
respectively; Figure S15], confirming the
expected specificity of the phages.

and (f) M13-g3p(ϕXv) when incubated with different bacterial
species and AuNPs. Bacterial species shown are E. coli (F+) (red), V. cholerae 0395 (blue), E. coli (I+) (magenta), P. aeruginosa (orange), X. campestris (pv campestris) (gray),
and X. campestris (pv vesicatoria) (green). The spectrum
of AuNPs alone (dotted black line) is also shown.

All of the chimeric phages that we attempted gave high sensitivity
and specificity in the AuNP-based assay without empirical optimization.
The generalizability of this strategy might be understood in terms
of the evolutionary “arms race” between bacteria and
phage: both host receptors and phage RBPs are characterized by rapid
evolution, and thus, it is likely that both the phage scaffold and
the RBPs have evolved high tolerance to changes in the RBP. Similarly,
the assay tolerated tap water and filtered seawater with negligible
change. Although human serum decreased the absorbance shift, the assay
was still readily interpretable in this media. The tolerance of the
assay to different conditions may also reflect the evolutionary history
of phages, which have been selected to attach to their hosts in natural,
sometimes harsh, environments. The primary cost associated with the
assay is cloning the chimeric phage. Given this, the assay itself
can be performed in less than an hour with a reagent cost of <$1.40
per assay (Table S2). It is possible to
decrease the reagent costs further by use of silver nanoparticles,
which give a yellow to orange color change upon aggregation and also
interact strongly with thiols.44 Indeed,
AgNPs can be used in analogous fashion in our assay (Figures S16 and S17). In addition, a potentially interesting
feature of AgNPs is their antimicrobial properties.45 An Eppendorf centrifuge is used to separate bacteria from
free phage here, although separations might also be achieved by less-expensive
means.15,46 Labor costs for the assay, as presented
here, are likely to exceed materials costs.

Conclusions
Here,
we have presented a platform for the rapid, inexpensive,
sensitive, and specific detection of microbial pathogens, based on
the phage-bacteria interactions that have evolved in nature.47−49 In this design, the RBP of a foreign phage was displayed on an M13
scaffold, creating chimeric phages to bind different host bacteria.
The phages were further chemically modified to interact with AuNPs,
bridging the target bacteria to the AuNPs, which act as a signal amplifier,
as aggregation of the AuNPs causes a visible shift in SPR absorbance.
The limit of detection (∼100 cells) in the present assay is
comparable with other high-sensitivity assays,50−53 and might be lowered by using
a lower resuspension volume or by addition of a culturing step. No
cross-reactivity was detected for the organisms tested here, although
specificity likely depends on the characteristics of the phage RBPs.
Some versatility has been demonstrated here, including detection of
two human pathogens as well as two strains of a plant pathogen, with
no experimental optimization required. This straightforward approach
may be useful for detection and identification of bacteria in situations
in which time and/or equipment resources are limited.

Bacterial Growth and Phage Production
E. coli ER2738 cells were grown in LB with tetracycline
(10 μg mL–1) at 37 °C overnight. A total
of 200 μL
of an overnight E. coli culture was used to inoculate
a 20 mL culture in a 250 mL Erlenmyer flask. To produce wild-type
M13, 1 μL of M13KE phage solution (1013 pfu/mL) was
added to the cell culture, and the flask was shaken at 37 °C
and 250 rpm for 4–5 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation
at 4500g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred
to a fresh tube for repeat centrifugation. The top 16 mL of supernatant
was then transferred to a new tube, and 4 mL of 2.5 M NaCl/20% PEG-8000
was added and the solution mixed. The solution was stored at 4 °C
overnight to precipitate the phages. The phage precipitates were collected
by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and
dissolved in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. The solution
was centrifuged briefly to pellet any cell debris. The supernatant
was transferred to a fresh tube, and 200 μL of 2.5 M NaCl/20%
PEG-8000 was added and the solution mixed. The sample was incubated
on ice for 1 h, and the phage was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm
for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the phage
pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of PBS buffer. The phage concentration
was determined by real-time PCR (see below).

Real-Time PCR Quantitation
of Phages
The concentration
of phage particles was determined by real-time PCR (forward primer:
5′-AAACTGGCAGATGCACGGTT-3′; reverse primer: 5′-AACCCGTCGGATTCTCCG-3′;
PCR conditions: 95 °C for 10 min and then 45 cycles of 95 °C
for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s) with SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green
Supermix and Biorad C1000 PCR machine. See Figure S11 for the standard curve.

Construction and Production
of Chimeric Phage
The RBP
of M13 (g3p) was engineered to replace its N-terminal domain (g3p-N)
with the homologous domain from a phage having specificity toward
the target bacterial species (Table 1). A plasmid containing the g3p-N homologue of the
source phage flanked by KpnI and NotI restriction
sites (see the Supporting Information)
was synthesized (IDT) and transformed into Mix and Go competent E. coli cells. The cells were grown in LB media with ampicillin
(10 μg mL–1), and the plasmid was isolated
using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. The M13-NotI-Kan phage vector,
in which a NotI restriction site was introduced between the N- and
C-terminal domains of M13, was prepared previously.12 The extracted plasmid and M13-NotI-Kan vector were digested
by KpnI-HF and NotI-HF. The desired products were
isolated by gel electrophoresis and purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction
Kit. The g3p-N homologue was ligated into the M13-NotI-Kan vector
using T4 DNA ligase. The recombinant plasmid was then transformed
into Mix and Go competent cells, which were plated on LB with kanamycin
(50 μg mL–1) and IPTG (0.1 M) and incubated
at 37 °C overnight. A single colony was selected and cultured
in LB media with kanamycin (50 μg mL–1) and
IPTG (0.1 M) in a shaking incubator at 37 °C overnight. The recombinant
plasmid was isolated using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. The inserted
gene in the phage vector was amplified by PCR (forward primer: 5′-
TTTGGAGCCTTTTTTTTGGAGATTTTCAAC-3′; reverse primer: 5′-
CACCACCAGAGCCTGC-3′; PCR conditions: 95 °C for 3 min,
then 11 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52.3 °C for 30 s and 72
°C for 60 s) and Sanger sequenced (UC Berkeley core facility)
to confirm the sequence of the chimeric phage genome. To produce chimeric
phages, a colony containing the chimeric phage genome was used to
inoculate a liquid culture and shaken overnight at 37 °C. The
phages were precipitated and purified by the double-polyethylene glycol
(PEG) precipitation method described above.

Thiolation of Chimeric
Phages
The phages were chemically
modified to incorporate thiol groups by coupling to cysteamine in
sterile PBS buffer at pH 7.9 according to a modified protocol.32 Oxygen in the phage solution and other reagents
was removed by purging with dry nitrogen for 30 min. A total of 1012 phages were reacted with 1 mM EDC, 1 mM NHS, and 1 mM cysteamine
in a volume of 2 mL with gentle stirring at room temperature. The
same amount of EDC was added 2 more times at time intervals of 30
min. The reaction ran overnight before extensive dialysis through
regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing (molecular weight cutoff of
3500 Da) against 250 mL of PBS buffer and 250 mL Milli-Q water followed
by two rounds of PEG/NaCl precipitation. The concentration of chemically
incorporated thiol groups was quantified with Ellman’s assay
using a cysteine as standard.54 The number
of thiol groups per phage was estimated by dividing the number of
thiol groups by the number of phage particles, quantified by real-time
PCR. See Figure S18 for standard curves.

Visualization of Attachment of Thiolated M13 Phage to E.
coli
A total of 1011 thiolated phages
produced from M13KE were incubated with 2 mg/mL fluorescein-5-maleimide
in 1 mL of PBS buffer (pH 7.0) with gentle stirring at room temperature
overnight. Free fluorescein-5-maleimide was removed with extensive
dialysis (MWCO 3500 Da) in 500 mL of PBS buffer (pH 7.0), and phages
were purified by two rounds of PEG/NaCl precipitation. Phages were
resuspended in 200 μL of PBS buffer. The fluorescein-conjugated
thiolated M13 phages (M13-FITC-SH) were incubated with 1 mL of Top
10F′ cells expressing cyan fluorescent protein at an optical
density ∼0.6 for 30 min at room temperature.12 Free phages were removed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm
and discarding of the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in 1
mL of PBS buffer for microscopy. The fluorescence images were obtained
on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany) with excitation
at 405 nm (NRI, UCSB).

Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles
The gold nanoparticles
were synthesized using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the
reducing agent and trisodium citrate as the capping agent through
a modified method by Oda et al.55 Typically,
0.23 mL of 0.1 M HAuCl4·3H2O aqueous solution
was added into 90 mL of deionized water, followed by the injection
of 2 mL of 38.8 mM trisodium citrate solution. Then 1 mL of 0.075
wt % freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (in 38.8 mM trisodium
citrate solution) was added after 5 min of stirring, and the reaction
mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. When desired, AuNPs
were concentrated by ultrafiltration to approximately half the original
volume with an Amicon Ultra-4 10 000 filter.

Detection of
Bacterial Cells Using Chimeric Phage and AuNPs
E.
coli ER2738 were grown in LB with tetracycline
(10 μg mL–1) at 37 °C to an optical density
(OD600) of ∼0.6–1. The relationship between
optical density and colony-forming units was determined by plating
dilutions of the culture and counting colonies. The propagation procedure
for other cells is given separately below. The cells were then diluted
to desired concentrations in different media: tap water (from laboratory
faucets at UCSB), seawater (from the Pacific Ocean collected at the
UCSB beach, filtered with 0.45 μm vacuum filter before use),
and human serum. The amount of cells is estimated based on the dilution
series, so the number of cells in a ∼1 or ∼10 CFU sample
will vary from the expectation value due to stochastic sampling and
these values should be taken as approximations. A total of 200 μL
of phage (1011 PFU/mL) was added to 1 mL of cell suspension
and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells (and attached
phages) were spun down by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at
4 °C. The 1.2 mL of supernatant was discarded by pipetting. The
pellet was washed with 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water twice before resuspension
in 100 μL of AuNPs solution. The color change was recorded with
a digital phone camera (iPhone 4s, Apple), and the absorbance of the
solutions was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy.

Specificity
of Bacterial Detection
The specificity
of detection was tested in the same assay as described above, using
a different bacterial species or strain from the known host of the
phage source of the g3p-N homologue (Table 1). Detection was also performed in a mixture
of host cells [E. coli ER2738, V. cholerae 0395, and P. aeruginosa (ATCC25102)] in an analogous
fashion.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM was performed
on a Tecnai FEI G2 Sphera microscope (MRL, UCSB). The samples were
prepared by applying a few drops of solution onto TEM grids coated
with a 20 nm thick carbon film. Phage samples (5 μL) pipetted
onto the TEM grids for 5 min, followed by rinsing with 10 μL
of Milli-Q water. The grids were then exposed to 8 μL of a 2%
uranyl acetate for 1 min as negative stain. Excess stain was removed,
and the grids were rinsed again with Milli-Q water before drying in
air.

Dynamic Light Scattering and ζ Potential Measurements
DLS and ζ potential were measured by using a Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZSP operating a 4 mW He–Ne laser at 633 nm. Each sample
was allowed to equilibrate for 2 min at constant temperature of 25
°C prior to analysis. All results are averages of a minimum of
three individual samples in which data from each sample are an average
of 5 measurements, each consisting of 10 runs. Sizes reported are
intensity-weighted diameter. Data was processed using Malvern Zetasizer
software v7.11. The raw data were extracted and plotted in OriginPro
2015.

Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared Spectra Measurement
ATR-FTIR spectra were measured with a Nicolet iS10 FTIR using a MCT
detector and a Harrick Scientific Corporation GATR accessory (MRL
at UCSB).

Ultraviolet–Visible Spectra Measurement
UV–vis
spectral and kinetic data were collected on a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV–vis
spectrophotometer with a quartz spectrasil UV–vis cuvette using
direct detection at a slit width of 2 nm (CNSI at UCSB).

Propagation
of Bacteria
V. cholerae Propagation
The propagation
of V. cholerae was carried out according to a reported
protocol.56 A single colony of V. cholerae was selected and grew in 5 mL of lysogeny broth
medium (pH 7) without antibiotics in a 50 mL Falcon tube at 37 °C
overnight. The bacterial concentration was determined by measuring
the optical density at 600 nm [y (CFU/mL) = 8 ×
108× (OD600); the conversion factor was
determined by colony formation titering assay in our lab].

P. aeruginosa ATCC 25102 (Schroeter) Migula
Propagation
The strain ATCC 25102(Schroeter) Migula was propagated
in ATCC Medium 3 nutrient broth. A single colony of P. aeruginosa was selected and grown in 5 mL of broth without antibiotics in a
50 mL Falcon tube at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacterial concentration
was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm [y (CFU/mL) = 2.0 × 108× (OD600) + 4.0 × 106 according to a previous report].57

X. campestris (pv campestris)
ATCC33913 Propagation
The strain ATCC33913 was propagated
in ATCC 73 YGC medium. A single
colony of X. campestris (pv campestris) was selected
and grown in 5 mL of broth without antibiotics in a 50 mL Falcon tube
at 26 °C for 48 h. The bacterial concentration was determined
by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 of 0.1
= 108 CFU/mL according to a previous report).58

X. campestris (pv vesicatoria)
ATCC35937 Propagation
The ATCC35937 was propagated in ATCC
1475 medium. A single colony
of X. campestris (pv vesicatoria) was selected and
grown in 5 mL of broth without antibiotics in a 50 mL Falcon tube
at 28 °C for 48 h. The bacteria concentration was determined
by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 of 0.2
= 108 CFU/mL according to a previous report).59

E. coli (I+)
ATCC27065 (Migula)
Castellani and Chalmers Propagation
The strain ATCC27065
was propagated in ATCC 265 medium. A single colony of E. coli (I+) was selected and grown in 5 mL of broth without
antibiotics in a 50 mL Falcon tube at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacterial
concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 600
nm [y (CFU/mL) = 4.0 × 108×
(OD600) + 2.18 × 107 determined by colony
formation titering assay in our lab].
