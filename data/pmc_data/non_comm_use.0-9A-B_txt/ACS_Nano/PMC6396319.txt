Peptide-mediated
routes to the synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles
have been drawing increasing attention for the development of chiroptically
active nanoscale architectures. However, designing a multifunctional
peptide able to drive the formation of structurally defined nanomaterials
endowed with specific functionalities is still challenging. In this
work, iodination has been devised as a strategy to strengthen Au-reduction
capability of the amyloidogenic peptide DFNKF and combine it with
its distinctive self-assembly features. Thanks to the Au-mediated
C—I activation on the phenylalanine iodobenzenes, the peptides
yield efficient Au-reduction ability promoting the synthesis of Au
nanoparticles, and simultaneously working as templates for their spontaneous
self-assembly into spherical superstructures endowed with chiroptical
activities. The reaction occurs in situ through a
one-pot process in aqueous media. The generality of this approach
has been demonstrated using an iodinated derivative of the peptide
KLVFF, which also showed reducing and templating abilities forming
chiroptically active helical superstructures decorated with Au nanoparticles.

Inspired by biomineralization
processes,1,2 peptide-mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles
(GNPs) exploits peptides’ ability to act as reducing and capping
agents,3,4 allowing in situ GNP nucleation
and growth in mild synthetic conditions.5,6 Additionally,
peptides are also endowed with peculiar self-assembly properties,
widely employed to fabricate nanostructures.7 The combination of biomineralization control, molecular recognition,
and self-assembly features render peptides an efficient tool to guide
the synthesis of GNPs and direct their assembly into custom architectures
with sequence-specific properties and functionalities.8,9 In this regard, peptides have been reported to confer chirality
to metal nanoparticles (NPs) when bound to their surface, leading
to chiroptically active nanostructures, which exhibit plasmon-induced
circular dichroism (CD) in the visible spectral region.10−12 Owing to their ability to control the rotation of light and give
a strong CD signal in a broader spectral range, when compared to chiral
molecules, chiroptically active peptide-GNP systems hold promise in
a wide range of high-end applications including catalysis, sensing,
enantioselective separation, and optical materials.13

The versatility and multifunctionality offered by
peptide-mediated
nanofabrication fueled significant research efforts aimed at investigating
the impact of peptide sequence on the GNPs synthesis and assembly
processes.14,15 Reduction capability, Au-binding
affinity, and peptide self-assembly have been recognized as essential
functionalities for the GNP synthesis outcome.16 It has been highlighted how challenging is combining good
Au-reduction and binding abilities in the same peptide sequence; in
fact, often sequences functioning as strong Au binders tend to have
low reduction capabilities.17 Therefore,
the design of multifunctional peptides able to successfully synthesize
GNPs and direct their assembly into hybrid nanostructures endowed
with specific functionalities is still an unmet need.

In the
repertoire of peptide sequences used to engineer innovative
nanomaterials, amyloidogenic peptides yielded a plethora of architectures,
often acting as templates for the self-assembly of inorganic nanostructures.18,19 Recent work from our group proved halogenation of phenylalanine
(Phe) residues to be an effective tool for exacerbating the self-assembly
and fibrillation behavior of amyloidogenic peptides.20 Specifically, iodination at the para position
of either one or two of the Phe residues of the human calcitonin-derived
DFNKF fragment (Figure 1a), resulted in iodinated amyloidogenic peptides with strong hydrogelation
properties not encountered in the wild-type (WT) sequence. In this
context, we reasoned that iodinated amyloidogenic peptides may bring
an entirely different paradigm in the field of peptide-mediated Au
reduction, thanks to the known ability of Au(I) species to activate
the C—I bond of iodobenzene,21 leading
to the formation of iodide ions, I–, which have
been reported to mediate efficient Au(III) reduction to Au(I).22 Our iodinated peptides may potentially combine,
in one unique sequence, optimal Au-binding ability of Phe residues23 with efficient Au-reduction thanks to the C—I
activation on the Phe iodobenzenes. Despite several studies on the
possible role of halide ions in GNP synthesis and growth having been
reported,24−26 to the best of our knowledge, rational peptide halogenation
as a strategy to strengthen reduction capability of peptides has never
been devised.

In this work, GNP synthesis and
assembly mediated by WT and iodinated
DFNKF were investigated. We combined the reducing ability of iodinated
Phe-rich peptides with their distinct amyloidal assembly to achieve
the simultaneous synthesis and self-assembly of GNPs for producing, in situ, chiroptically active Au–peptide superstructures.
The same approach was employed with the peptide sequence KLVFF, whose
bis-iodinated form produced ribbon-like helical superstructures decorated
with GNPs and showing chiroptical activity.27 Notably, the synthetic protocols were performed in environmentally
benign conditions, working in one-pot aqueous solutions without the
further addition of a reducing agent.

Results and Discussion
Iodinated
Peptide-Mediated Au-Reduction
First, WT-DFNKF
reducing capability was evaluated. A yellowish aqueous solution containing
HAuCl4 (0.5 mM) and DFNKF (0.5 mM) (peptide/Au ratio 1:1)
was heated up to 60 °C for 1 h under magnetic stirring, leading
to the formation of a colorless solution. After 48 h, the final sample
appeared slightly pinkish, suggesting a weak reducing ability of the
WT peptide to form GNPs. The UV–vis spectrum of this sample
after 48 h from its preparation did not show any surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) peak, while an absorbance peak given by HAuCl4 at
307 nm could still be observed, indicating the limited reduction of
AuCl4– (Figure 1b). To further investigate the reducing ability
of the WT peptide, the synthetic procedure was kinetically monitored
recording UV–vis absorption spectra of sample aliquots at regular
time intervals. No SPR signal could be observed in 72 h (Figure S1). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) imaging showed the presence of only a few GNPs (Figure S2), confirming the weak ability of the
WT-DFNKF to mediate GNP formation.

A stronger reduction capability
was instead observed for both DF(I)NKF and DF(I)NKF(I) peptides, which
yielded, using the same synthetic procedure of the WT peptide, a purple
solution, indicating the efficient reduction of Au(III) to Au(0) and
the formation of GNPs (Figure 1b). UV–vis spectra of the DF(I)NKF_Au and DF(I)NKF(I)_Au
dispersions were characterized by strong SPR peaks at 561 and 562
nm, respectively, confirming the formation of GNPs (Figure 1c).

The kinetics of the
reactions mediated by DF(I)NKF and DF(I)NKF(I)
were studied through UV–vis spectroscopy. For the DF(I)NKF_Au
sample, three reaction stages could be identified (Figures 1d and S3): GNP growth (0–60 min), reaction termination (60–180
min), and GNP aggregation (180–360 min). In particular, during
the GNP growth stage, a gradual increase of the SPR signal absorbance
(ABS) could be observed, indicating the formation of new GNPs in the
solution. During the reaction termination stage, SPR peak ABS values
and positions in the spectra remained almost constant, evidencing
that GNP nucleation and growth steps were completed. In the last stage
of the kinetic study (180–360 min), SPR peak ABS decreased
in value and the peak was red-shifted, highlighting aggregation.28 In comparison to the monoiodinated derivative,
DF(I)NKF(I) was proven to be a less efficient reductant, as shown
by the duration of the growth stage, which resulted to be twice as
long (Figure 1e and S3). This effect is most likely caused by the
higher tendency of the bis-iodinated derivative to fibrillate, in
comparison to the monoiodinated, which competes with the Au-binding
ability of the peptide.20,29 After 2 h, no further
significant variation in the ABS value could be observed, indicating
reaction termination. Given the obtained results, the duration of
the synthetic procedure was set to 1 h for DF(I)NKF_Au sample and
to 2 h for DF(I)NKF(I)_Au.

Au–Peptide Chiroptically Active Spherical
Superstructures
Together with leading to an efficient synthesis
of GNPs, DF(I)NKF
and DF(I)NKF(I) also functioned as templates for their simultaneous
self-assembly, yielding the formation of Au–peptide spherical
superstructures. In fact, TEM analysis of GNP dispersions obtained
by means of DF(I)NKF and DF(I)NKF(I) reducing action showed the presence
of Au–peptide spherical superstructures of 50–200 nm
size (Figure 2a–c).
The assembly of GNPs into functional superstructures is currently
a hot topic in the field of nanomaterials.30−35 However, only a few of these systems were obtained through a one-pot
approach, a strategy that requires fewer preparative steps, compared
to bottom-up approaches, and provides in situ direct
access to well-defined superstructures.19,36,37

DF(I)NKF 0.5 mM, DF(I)NKF_Au 1:4, 1:2, and 1:1 samples.

Various DF(I)NKF_Au and DF(I)NKF(I)_Au samples
were prepared by
changing the peptide/Au ratio, keeping constant the Au(III) concentration
in the starting solution. As shown by Figure 2a–c, the peptide/Au ratio plays a
key role in determining the quality and quantity of resulting DF(I)NKF_Au
superstructures. Indeed, increasing the peptide concentration, the
monodispersity of the assembled superstructures significantly improved,
suggesting the important role of the peptide supramolecular organization
in determining the morphology of the final DF(I)NKF_Au aggregates.
In particular, for the sample having the lowest peptide concentration
(DF(I)NKF/Au 1:4) the main population was composed of single GNPs
having a diameter in the range of 5–10 nm, with the presence
of a few spherical DF(I)NKF_Au superstructures of about 50 nm in size
(Figure 2a). Doubling
the peptide concentration (DF(I)NKF/Au 1:2), DF(I)NKF_Au superstructures
increased in number and size, while they became the dominant population
in the sample with the 1:1 peptide/Au ratio, for which TEM analysis
revealed the presence of highly monodispersed 200 nm-sized superstructures
(Figure 2c). Further,
the three-dimensional (3D) internal details about the structural organization
of the DF(I)NKF_Au superstructures were probed via electron tomography
(ET) reconstruction. As shown in Figure 2d–f and Video S1, the Au–peptide superstructure comprises of a monolayer
shell of GNPs of 5–10 nm in size and a peptide core. Furthermore,
EDS analysis confirmed the presence of both Au and N, attributable
to the peptide, in the superstructure (Figure S4). DF(I)NKF_Au superstructures were also imaged in cryogenic
conditions, to verify the presence of the spherical superstructures
in solution and their ability to retain their structural features
upon drying (Figure S5). The different
aggregation pattern obtained varying peptide/Au ratio was also confirmed
by UV–vis studies, which showed a redshift of the SPR peak
increasing the peptide concentration in the sample, as a consequence
of GNP arrangement on the superstructure (Figure 2g).

CD studies on DF(I)NKF_Au samples
highlighted a conformational
change in the peptide secondary structure upon binding the GNPs (Figure S6). In particular, when compared to the
free peptide in solution, the UV region of the CD spectra for the
DF(I)NKF_Au samples shows a redshift, which indicates a peptide conformational
change due to the onset of the Au–peptide interaction. Importantly,
DF(I)NKF also conferred a new functionality to the resulting superstructures
rendering them chiroptically active, as shown by the activation of
a CD signal in the visible spectral region (Figure 2h). Chiroptical activity in the DF(I)NKF_Au
superstructure arises from binding the chiral peptide to the GNPs
and their organization on the hybrid assembly.38 As previously reported, chiral molecules can impart optical
activity to achiral materials and produce a CD response in the visible
spectral region, via the occurrence of electronic interactions between
chiral peptide moieties and metal electrons.10,39 Thus, in our hybrid superstructures, the observed chiroptical activity
is conferred by peptide binding on the GNPs surface, which resulted
in the generation of a strong negative CD signal in the visible region
of the spectrum.

The ability to control the rotation of light
is a highly desirable
property in the fields of optical materials and sensing, and, currently,
the development of chiral GNPs is gaining considerable research attention.40 To the best of our knowledge, chiroptically
active spherical Au–peptide superstructures have not been reported
in the literature to date. In this framework, the approach developed
in this study offers direct access to chiroptically active Au–peptide
superstructures through an environmentally benign procedure.

The ability to simultaneously drive the synthesis and assembly
of GNPs into Au–peptide superstructures was also confirmed
for the bis-iodinated DFNKF derivative, DF(I)NKF(I) (Figure S7a). Notably, DF(I)NKF(I)_Au superstructures were
largely formed also at the lowest peptide concentration (DF(I)NKF(I)/Au
1:4), in which only a few free GNPs could be observed (Figure S7A). The increase of DF(I)NKF(I) concentration
mostly led to the formation of peptide fibers, which could be observed
together with DF(I)NKF(I)_Au superstructures in the sample DF(I)NKF(I)_Au
1:1 (Figure S7c). These results confirmed
the stronger self-assembly tendency of DF(I)NKF(I), in comparison
to the monoiodinated derivative,20 which
may explain its slower reducing action. In fact, the onset of the
Au–peptide interaction competes with the peptide self-assembly
process, which hinders the redox reaction. Interestingly, the tomography
3D reconstruction of the DF(I)NKF(I)_Au superstructures highlighted
a more ellipsoidal shape. Furthermore, also DF(I)NKF(I)_Au superstructures
were endowed with chiroptical activity, as shown by the CD results
in Figure S7h.

Insights on the Au–Peptide
Superstructure Formation Mechanism
To investigate the superstructure
formation mechanism, reaction
intermediates were collected after 10 min of sample incubation at
60 °C and analyzed via TEM, STEM, and EDS techniques. Collected
aliquots were directly placed on plasma-cleaned TEM grids, to induce
reaction termination, and analyze the Au–peptide structures
formed after a short incubation time. As shown by Figure 3a, TEM images of DF(I)NKF_Au
reaction intermediates revealed the formation of spherical aggregates,
whose contrast and structural features differ significantly from the
ones showed by the pure peptide, which resulted in being mostly featureless
structures (Figure S9). The STEM image
in Figure 3b shows
the presence of only two GNPs on the surface of the spherical aggregate
and the EDS results proved the presence of both Au and N in the aggregate.
This evidence indicates that the Au–peptide interaction strongly
perturbs the peptide self-assembly and promotes the formation of spherical
aggregates, as schematically represented in Figure 3d. Once the aggregate is assembled, Au(III)
is reduced in situ, leading to the growth of GNPs
directly on the surface of the spherical aggregate with the formation
of the final Au–peptide superstructures. The same formation
process was confirmed for the DF(I)NKF(I)_Au system, for which STEM
and EDS results are shown in Figure S10. Comparing the self-assembly pattern of DF(I)NKF(I) when pure in
solution and after interaction with Au, it can be seen that, as for
the monoiodinated derivative, the interaction with Au strongly impacts
the peptide self-assembly, leading to the prevalent formation of spheres
rather than fibers (Figure S10).

formation mechanism; (e) schematic representation of the iodine-promoted
Au reduction mechanism.

On the basis of these observations and additional control
experiments,
we reported in Figure 3e the hypothesized mechanism of GNP synthesis mediated by the halogenated
DFNKF derivatives. First, Au(III) reduction to Au(I), driven by the
−NH2 peptide residues, takes place.41

The formed Au(I) activates the −C—I
bond on the Phe-iodobenzene
groups of the halogenated DFNKF derivatives, leading to the formation
of iodide ions. The possible role of iodide ions in GNP synthesis
and their ability to reduce Au(III) to Au(I) have already been discussed
in the literature.21 Notably, the Au(I)
species produced by the reductive action of I– can
further favor the activation of the C—I bond in the iodinated
peptides, strongly promoting the Au reduction mechanism. In fact,
Au(I) both promotes −C—I bond activation and via disproportionation42 function as a source of Au(0), which leads to
the formation of GNPs and additional Au(III).

Importantly, NMR
spectra of the Au–peptide samples are characterized
by significant changes in the region of the aromatic Phe protons,
both in the DF(I)NKF_Au system (Figures S12 and S13) and in the DF(I)NKF(I)_Au one, proving the modification
of the iodobenzene system. Finally, the definitive confirmation of
the Au(I) role in the GNP formation was given by the addition to the
reaction of the ligand 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), known complex
agent of Au(I) in aqueous solutions.43 Indeed,
upon addition of bpy to the reaction mixture, Au(I) disproportionation
was inhibited and GNP formation did not occur, as suggested by the
colorless feature of the dispersion and further proved by the lack
of the SPR peak in the UV–vis spectrum (Figure S14).

A General Approach: Application to KLVFF
Peptides
To
verify whether iodination might be a general strategy to obtain peptide
sequences endowed with good reduction capability, the same approach
was employed with the β-amyloid derived sequence KLVFF. Previous
studies from our group reported the impact of halogenation on KLVFF
self-assembly, highlighting the ability of the KLVF(I)F(I) to yield
hydrogels characterized by ribbon-like fibers.33

The impact of iodination on the peptide reduction
ability was also confirmed for KLVFF using the same experimental protocol
of the DFNKF derivatives. Indeed, as shown by Figure 4a–c, while the KLVFF_Au sample appeared
almost colorless, indicating a limited formation of GNPs (Figure 4a), the KLVF(I)F(I)_Au
dispersion was characterized by a purple color, suggesting the formation
of GNPs. TEM analysis showed the presence of KLVF(I)F(I) ribbons decorated
with 5–10 nm sized GNPs all along their surface (Figure 4b,c). The obtained results
demonstrate the generality of the synthetic approach devised in this
study, proving iodination to be an innovative tool to turn a mildly
reducing peptide sequence into a strongly reducing one. Furthermore,
as for the DFNKF iodinated derivatives, also KLVF(I)F(I) simultaneously
drove the synthesis and the self-assembly of GNPs, yielding ribbon-like
Au–peptide superstructures.

1:1 samples; (e) CD spectra of KLVF(I)F(I) and KLVF(I)F(I)_Au 1:1
samples.

Importantly, UV–vis studies
on KLVFF_Au 1:1 and KLVF(I)F(I)_Au
1:1 samples confirmed the presence of an SPR peak at 545 nm only for
KLVF(I)F(I)_Au (Figure 4d). Notably, CD spectra acquired in the visible region also proved
the chiroptical activity of the KLVF(I)F(I)_Au sample, showing a negative
peak at 523 nm. CD signal intensity was comparable to the one obtained
for the DF(I)NKF(I)_Au 1:1 system, indicating that the Au–peptide
supramolecular organization does not significantly impact the chiroptical
activity, being its origin most likely due to the GNP attachment to
the chiral peptide.

Conclusions
Chiral and chiroptically
active assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles,
owing to their potential application in high-end fields, have gained
an increase in research attention in the past decade. Fabrication
methods based on the self-assembly of molecular scaffolds are a promising
route to guide the formation of chiroptically active plasmonic nanomaterials.
In this framework, peptides have been highlighted for their ability
to confer chiroptical activity to metal nanoparticles through simple
binding to the NP surface and/or arranging the NPs in a chiral supramolecular
configuration with a strong interparticle interaction.

In this
study, we designed and achieved an elegant one-pot synthetic
strategy mediated by iodinated peptides to obtain chiroptically active
superstructures. Au(III) strongly affects the self-assembly of iodinated
DFNKF peptides driving the formation of spherical nanoscale objects,
which are not observed in the pure starting solutions. Au(III) reduction
and growth of GNPs occur in situ on the surface of
these preformed spherical peptide aggregates by means of the complex
chemistry of Au(I), which is a key intermediate of the process working
simultaneously as a source of reductant agent, I–, and Au(0). In fact, removing Au(I) from the reaction by addition
of a scavenger switches completely off the synthesis of GNPs. Moreover,
the WT-peptide does not form GNPs in the same experimental conditions.

Importantly, the proposed approach is general, allowing one to
work with various peptide sequences, obtaining diverse superstructures,
from spheres to helical fibers. In particular, iodination may be considered
a multifunctional tool providing the peptide with both an enhanced
reducing ability and an exacerbated self-assembly attitude, which
lead to the formation of hybrid superstructures endowed with chiroptical
activity.

We envisage that this synthetic approach, based on
specific iodination
of an amino acid, may be applied to all classes of self-assembling
peptides. Thus, it provides a powerful pathway for the development
of chiroptically active plasmonic nanomaterials and may possibly have
an impact on the future progress of optical devices.

Circular Dicroism (CD) Analysis
All the CD experiments
were carried out in deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm) in a 0.1
cm quartz cuvette, using a JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer. Acquisitions
were performed in the ranges 190–300 nm and 300–650
nm using 0.5 nm data pitch, 1 nm bandwidth, 100 nm/min scanning speed,
and 1 s response time. All the spectra are an average of 10 scans
and were corrected from a reference solution, comprising deionized
water (18.2 MΩ·cm) alone. For the data acquired in the
190–300 nm range, raw data (θ, in millidegree) were subsequently
converted to mean residue ellipticity (θ in deg cm2 dmol–1) for the sake of comparison, in accordance
with the following formula  where θ is the observed ellipticity
