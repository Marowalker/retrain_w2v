Singular
beams have attracted great attention due to their optical
properties and broad applications from light manipulation to optical
communications. However, there has been a lack of practical schemes
with which to achieve switchable singular beams with sub-wavelength
resolution using ultrathin and flat optical devices. In this work,
we demonstrate the generation of switchable vector and vortex beams
utilizing dynamic metasurfaces at visible frequencies. The dynamic
functionality of the metasurface pixels is enabled by the utilization
of magnesium nanorods, which possess plasmonic reconfigurability upon
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. We show that switchable vector
beams of different polarization states and switchable vortex beams
of different topological charges can be implemented through simple
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the same metasurfaces. Furthermore,
we demonstrate a two-cascade metasurface scheme for holographic pattern
switching, taking inspiration from orbital angular momentum-shift
keying. Our work provides an additional degree of freedom to develop
high-security optical elements for anti-counterfeiting applications.

==== Body
Vector and
vortex beams are
the forms of singular beams based on spatial distributions of polarization
and phase, respectively. A vector beam possesses polarization singularity,
which is characterized by a space-variant polarization distribution
in the transverse plane. A vortex beam manifests phase singularity,
which is characterized by a helical phase-front, carrying an orbital
angular momentum (OAM). Singular beams empower a broad range of applications
in particle trapping and manipulation1 and
high-resolution imaging2 and lithography
as well as quantum science and optical communications.3−7 Optical fibers,8q-plates,9 and spatial light modulators10,11 have been adopted to generate singular beams. Nevertheless, the
optical elements involved in these approaches are usually bulky and
complex. Such fundamental and technological difficulties pose challenges
to the development of compact, efficient, multifunctional optical
devices for integrated optics.

Metasurfaces provide an elegant
solution to these difficulties.
A metasurface is an artificial nanostructured interface that manipulates
light by spatially arranged meta-atoms. These meta-atoms, usually
consisting of plasmonic or dielectric nanoantennas, can locally control
light properties such as phase, amplitude, and polarization.12,13 Metasurfaces have enabled a family of ultrathin and flat optical
elements, which lead to a plethora of optical functionalities including
light focusing and steering,14 holography,15,16 imaging,17−19 and vector and vortex beam generation,20−24 among others. However, research endeavors have been mainly devoted
to static metasurface devices, in which the properties of individual
pixels cannot be reconfigured in real time, especially at visible
frequencies. Although in previous studies, tunability has been demonstrated
by changing the propagation direction or polarization state of the
incident light, the metasurfaces themselves are intrinsically static
once the devices are fabricated.25−27 This leaves out many
opportunities that metasurfaces can offer.

In this work, we
demonstrate the generation of switchable singular
beams utilizing dynamic metasurfaces at visible frequencies. The dynamic
functionality of the metasurface pixels is enabled by the utilization
of magnesium (Mg) nanorods, which possess plasmonic reconfigurability
upon hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.28,29 Mg can undergo
a phase transition from metal to dielectric upon H2 loading,
forming magnesium hydride (MgH2). This transition is reversible
through dehydrogenation using O2. We show that switchable
vector beams of different polarization states and switchable vortex
beams of different topological charges can be accomplished through
simple hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the metasurfaces without
physically changing any optical element. We further demonstrate a
proof of concept experiment using dynamic metasurfaces for holographic
pattern switching through OAM multiplexing. This work features a paradigm
for realization of compact and multitasking dynamic optical elements.

Results
and Discussion
We start with the design of a plasmonic metasurface
that can generate
two anomalously reflected vortex beams with opposite topological charges
of l and −l, respectively, at normal incidence of circularly
polarized (CP) light as shown in Figure 1a. Upon incidence of right-handed circularly
polarized (RCP) light, the two reflected vortex beams (off-axis angle
of 25°) with the same polarization can be written as follows: 1   2  where θ is the azimuthal
angle. φ1 and φ2 are the initial
phases of the two
vortex beams, respectively.  is the Jones vector of
RCP light. Upon
incidence of left-handed circularly polarized (LCP) light, the phase
profiles flip in the spatial domain,15 forming
two vortex beams as follows: 3   4

dimension of each super unit cell is 600 nm × 600 nm. (d) Experimentally
recorded beam patterns upon switching between azimuthal and radial

column in each row shows a doughnut-shaped intensity profile. The
rest of the columns in each row show petal-shaped intensity patterns
after passing through a linear polarizer. The orientations of the
polarizer are indicated by the arrows above.

For linearly polarized (LP) light, which contains RCP and
LCP light
with equal intensity, the reflected light is a vector beam, resulting
from the superposition of two vortex beams of opposite topological
charges (see the Supporting Information).

The values of φ1 and φ2 control
the polarization distributions of the generated vector beam. For example,
if φ1 = φ2, the reflected light
on one side (eq 1 plus eq 3) can be written as , corresponding
to a radially polarized
vector beam. However, if φ1 = φ2 + π, the reflected light (eq 1 plus eq 3) can be written as , corresponding
to an azimuthally polarized
vector beam. As a result, vector beams of different polarization states
(radial or azimuthal polarization) can be generated by properly defining
the relationship between the two initial phases.

Next, we demonstrate
switching between azimuthal and radial polarizations
using a dynamic metasurface. As illustrated by the schematic in Figure 1b, azimuthally and
radially polarized vector beams of l = 1 are designed
as initial and final states, respectively. The switching between these
two states is enabled by reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation
of the metasurface. The working principle of the metasurface is presented
in Figure 1c. Each
super unit cell of the metasurface contains three pixels: one gold
(Au) nanorod and two Mg nanorods. All of the nanorods have the same
dimensions of 200 nm × 80 nm × 50 nm. The Au nanorod remains
orthogonal with respect to one of the Mg nanorods (i.e., Mg (I)). Before hydrogenation, these two pixels cancel each other
in reflectance in the far field due to destructive interference.30 The net metasurface functionality is governed
by the second Mg nanorod (i.e., Mg (II)), which is
geometrically engineered to obtain the acquired Pancharatnam–Berry
(PB) phase profiles for generating an azimuthally polarized vector
beam of l = 1 (see Figure 1b). After hydrogenation, the two Mg nanorods
are transformed into MgH2 nanorods. The net function of
the super unit cell is thus determined by the Au nanorod, which is
engineered to generate a radially polarized vector beam of l = 1 (see Figure 1b). As a result, switchable vector beams of different polarization
states can be readily achieved through hydrogenation/dehydrogenation
of the metasurface without changing any optical elements in the optical
path.

Figure 1c shows
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the metasurface sample.
The sample fabrication process can be found in the Supporting Information. For optical characterizations, the
metasurface placed in a gas cell is illuminated by LP light at 633
nm (see the optical setup in Figure S1).
The experimental results are presented in Figure 1d. Before hydrogenation (upper row), the
intensity profile (first column) shows a typical doughnut shape. When
a polarizer is placed in the optical path and rotates continuously,
the polarized intensities are petal-shaped, indicating the generation
of an azimuthally polarized vector beam of l = 1.
After hydrogenation, the petal-shaped intensity profiles are orthogonal
to the corresponding ones in the upper row following the same analyzing
polarizer. This confirms the generation of a radially polarized vector
beam of l = 1. The two polarization states can be
reversibly switched using H2 and O2, respectively.
It is worth mentioning that to shape the light wavefronts, 8 nanorods
oriented from 0° to 180° at an interval of 22.5° (i.e., eight phase levels) are utilized to generate the desired
phase profile on the metasurface. It results in changes of the light
intensity after the rotating analyzer at different polarization angles.
This can be improved by increasing the number of phase levels on the
metasurface. Videos that record the vector beam switching between
azimuthal and radial polarizations with l = 1, 2,
and 3 can be found in Movies S1–S3, respectively. The efficiency of the metasurface device reaches
23%, and the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation process takes 3 min
in total.

To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we
further show
switching between vector beams of different orders in Figure 2a. In this case, the Mg nanorod
(i.e., Mg (II)) and the Au nanorod are geometrically
engineered on the metasurface to generate radially polarized vector
beams of l = 2 and 1, respectively. Figure 2b presents the SEM image of
the metasurface sample. As shown in Figure 2c, the number of petals in the intensity
patterns can be switched between 4 and 2 through hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation. A video that records this reversible process can
be found in Movie S4.

(b) SEM image of the metasurface sample. (c) Experimentally recorded
beam patterns, upon switching between l = 2 and 1
through hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. The first column in each
row shows a doughnut-shaped intensity profile. The rest of the columns
in each row show petal-shaped intensity patterns after passing through
a linear polarizer. The orientations of the polarizer are indicated
by the arrows above.

The same working principal can also be adopted to achieve
switchable
vortex beams of different topological charges. CP light is chosen
as the incident light to generate vortex beams (see the optical setup
in Figure S2). Vortex beam switching between
topological charges of l = 1 and 2 as well as l = 1 and 3 upon H2 and O2 loading
are demonstrated in panels a and b of Figure 3, respectively. It is evident that the central
dark area of the light beam becomes larger when the topological charge
increases. Because the OAM states of different topological charges
are mutually orthogonal, they could be used as carriers of different
information channels for multiplexing and transmitting multiple data
streams, which potentially increase the capacity of free-space optical
communication systems.31−33 For instance, OAM shift keying (OAM-SK) is one of
the important schemes in OAM-based optical communications. In this
case, the OAM states of vortex beams are regarded as a modulation
format, which enables information encryption by the dynamic switching
of spatial light modulators.34

Schematic illustration and experimental results of the switchable
vortex beams between l = 1 and 2 upon H2 and O2 loading. (b) Schematic illustration and experimental
results of the switchable vortex beams between l =
1 and 3 upon H2 and O2 loading.

Next, we demonstrate a proof of concept experiment
using dynamic
metasurfaces for holographic pattern switching as illustrated in Figure 4a. We employ two
metasurfaces, M1 and M2, for encoding and decoding the information,
respectively. The first metasurface (M1) is designed to generate a
vortex beam at incidence of CP light. Upon H2 and O2 loading, the outgoing vortex beam can be dynamically switched
between two different OAM states with topological charges of l = +m and −m,
respectively, as shown in Figure 4a. The data carried by the vortex beam are then transmitted
in free space, and the beam is incident on the second metasurface
(M2). M2 is designed to reconstruct different information in response
to the vortex beam of different OAM states. The design details of
M2 can be found in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 Dynamic metasurface for holographic pattern switching through OAM
multiplexing. (a) Schematic illustration of the concept. The first
metasurface (M1) is designed to generate a vortex beam at incidence
of CP light. Upon H2 and O2 loading, the outgoing
vortex beam can be dynamically switched between two different OAM
states with topological charges of l = +m and −m, respectively. The second metasurface
(M2) is designed to reconstruct different information in response
to the vortex beam of different OAM states. (b) Optical setup of the
experiment. LP and QWP represent the linear polarizer and the quarter-wave
plate, respectively. An objective lens with ×20 magnification
is utilized to magnify the images. (c) Simulated and experimental
results. Upon H2 and O2 loading, the hologram
information, letters “Y” and “X” can be
decoded, respectively.

The experimental setup is depicted in Figure 4b. A dynamic vortex beam is generated by
M1 through hydrogenation/dehydrogenation as described above. Then,
the anomalously reflected vortex beam passes through M2, generating
different target images for the two different vortex beams. As an
example, we use M1 to generate a vortex beam, which can be switched
between topological charges of l = +3 and l = −3. M2 is designed to construct OAM multiplexing
hologram of letters “X” and “Y”, in response
to vortex beams of l = +3 and −3, respectively.
The simulated and experimental results are presented in Figure 4c. Initially, only “X”
is observed, because the output vortex beam from M1 has a topological
charge of l = +3. After H2 loading, “X”
gradually vanishes and “Y” becomes visible, as the topological
charge of the output vortex beam is changed to l =
−3. Upon O2 loading, “X” appears again.
A video that records this process can be found in Movie S5. The efficiency of the metasurface device for OAM
hologram generation is 5%. It can be largely improved using a reflective
metasurface16 or a dielectric metasurface.35 It is also noteworthy that the target information
in the two channels has been encoded within a single hologram design.
This results in information leakage due to the background noise, which
lowers the holographic image contrast. Improved algorithms can be
used to increase the accuracy of the complex amplitude reconstructions
for achieving a better image contrast. Meanwhile, the incomplete destructive
interference between the Au and Mg nanorods in the far field leads
to undesired intensity residuals, resulting in low contrast. Optimizations
of the Au and Mg nanorod dimensions for better signal cancellations
in the far field will largely improve the contrast.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have experimentally demonstrated switchable singular
beams with dynamic metasurfaces. Vector beams of different polarization
states or vortex beams of different topological charges can be dynamically
generated simply by hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of the metasurfaces.
In particular, we have shown holographic pattern switching using two
cascaded metasurfaces, taking inspiration from OAM-SK. For practical
applications, the efficiencies of the metasurface devices can be enhanced
through further design optimizations.16 Meanwhile, their stability and durability can be improved through
careful material engineering and optimizations using Mg alloys for
achieving robust switching36 as well as
using a polytetrafluoroethylene protective layer for avoiding water
staining. Our work provides an additional degree of freedom to develop
high-security optical elements for anti-counterfeiting applications.

Experimental Methods
Sample Fabrications
All the samples in this work were
fabricated using multistep electron-beam lithography (EBL). First,
a structural layer composed of Au nanorods and alignment markers were
defined in a PMMA resist (Allresist) using EBL (Raith e_line) on a
substrate. A 2 nm Cr adhesion layer and a 50 nm Au film were successively
deposited on the substrate through thermal evaporation followed by
metal lift-off. Next, the substrate was coated with a PMMA resist.
Computer-controlled alignment using the Au markers was carried out
to define a second structural layer. Subsequently, 3 nm Ti, 50 nm
Mg, 5 nm Ti, and 10 nm Pd films were deposited on the substrate through
electron-beam evaporation followed by metal lift-off. The samples
for vector and vortex beam generations were manufactured on SiO2 (100 nm)/Si substrates for reflection-based metasurfaces.
The sample for OAM multiplexing hologram generation was manufactured
on a SiO2 substrate for a transmission-based metasurface.

Optical Setups
The light beam was generated from a
laser diode source (633 nm). A linear polarizer was employed to obtain
LP light. A lens and an aperture were utilized to reshape the light
beam to a similar size as the sample area to avoid undesired reflected
light. The light beam was incident on the metasurface sample placed
in a homemade gas cell. The reflected vector beams were projected
onto the screens in the far field and captured by a camera, as shown
in Figure S1. It should be noticed that
the generated vector beam on one of the screens was the one with the
desired polarization. For the vortex beam generation, an additional
quarter-wave plate was employed to obtain the required incident CP
light. According to the metasurface design, only one screen was necessary
in this case (see Figure S2). All of the
experiments were carried out at 80 °C to facilitate the switching
upon H2 or O2 loading.
