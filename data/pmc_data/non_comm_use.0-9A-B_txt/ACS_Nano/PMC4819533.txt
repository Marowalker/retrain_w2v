An
increasing number of technologies require the fabrication of
conductive structures on a broad range of scales and over large areas.
Here, we introduce advanced yet simple electrohydrodynamic lithography
(EHL) for patterning conductive polymers directly on a substrate with
high fidelity. We illustrate the generality of this robust, low-cost
method by structuring thin polypyrrole films via electric-field-induced
instabilities, yielding well-defined conductive structures with feature
sizes ranging from tens of micrometers to hundreds of nanometers.
Exploitation of a conductive polymer induces free charge suppression
of the field in the polymer film, paving the way for accessing scale
sizes in the low submicron range. We show the feasibility of the polypyrrole-based
structures for field-effect transistor devices. Controlled EHL pattering
of conductive polymer structures at the micro and nano scale demonstrated
in this study combined with the possibility of effectively tuning
the dimensions of the tailor-made architectures might herald a route
toward various submicron device applications in supercapacitors, photovoltaics,
sensors, and electronic displays.

==== Body
Conductive polymers (CPs) combine
properties of polymers with the electrical, chemical, and optical
properties of metals. Straightforward processing, tunable optoelectronic
properties via molecular design, high surface area,
and the possibility of modifying conductivity by doping, are only
a few of the advantages attributed to CPs. Considerable research has
been directed toward studying CPs aiming for their potential implementation
into a variety of functional devices, including field effect transistors
(FETs),1,2 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), integrated
circuits, chemical and biological sensors,3 and electrochromic devices.4

In
order to take full advantage of the functions of π-conjugated
macromolecules and, in particular, for generation of flexible organic
electronics, patterning of CPs into structures ranging from 100 μm
to sub-100 nm is required. Moreover, generation of high-fidelity submicrometer
architectures with a good adhesion to the substrate in a controlled
manner is essential to realize the full potential of CPs patterning
for their future integration into applied devices.5 Conducting polymer micro- and nanostructures can, for instance,
be used for red, green, or blue (RGB) pixels in multicolour OLED displays
and interconnects in all-polymer integrated circuits.6

Routes for patterning CPs have been explored extensively,
and the
most prominent techniques are soft-lithography,7 electron beam lithography,8 photochemical
patterning by photolithography,9,10 and nanoimprinting.11 Hitherto, however, most of the existing approaches
to pattern CPs exhibit limitations in certain aspects including resolution,
position control, versatility, and reproducibility. Although some
conventional lithographic techniques approach their physical limits,
others are incompatible with CPs due to the poor adhesion between
the polymers and the substrate. In light of the complexity involved
in obtaining high resolution registration from soft-lithography, together
with an increasing need to develop low-cost and high-throughput methods
for patterning conductive polymer films, interest in alternative patterning
processes has grown.

In the present work, we introduce an elegant,
straightforward EHL
technique for direct patterning of conductive polymers. Theoretical
studies addressing pattern generation have predicted electrohydrodynamic
pattern formation in conducting liquids;12−14 yet, these
have not been demonstrated to date. Herein, a versatile organic semiconductor,
polypyrrole (PPy) film is patterned via the EHL technique
enabling highly ordered structures which can be easily assembled into
functional devices. This method provides a single-step and cost-effective
approach for direct patterning of conjugated polymers on solid substrates,
generating a variety of feature sizes ranging from tens of micrometers
to hundreds of nanometers.15−17 The EHL concept exploits an instability
induced by an applied electric field across the liquefied polymer–air
bilayer sandwiched between two-electrodes in a capacitor-like device.
In the case of dielectric polymers, the electric field causes the
energetically unfavorable buildup of displacement charges at the dielectric
interface, leading to the alignment of the dielectric interface parallel to the electric field lines, which lowers the
electrostatic energy. In a homogeneous electric field, this typically
results in pillar structures that span the two electrodes. Because
the total potential difference generated by the dipole layers at the
interface is suppressed across the conductive liquid layer, the driving
force of the pattern formation in the case of a leaky dielectric polymer subjected to the EHL patterning lies in the electric field
in the air gap, E1.14 A subambient
pressure within the film balances the electrostatic force due to the
field in the air gap on the polymer–air interface, placing
the film in tension, and therefore, generating the origin of the EHL
instability. The intrinsic length scale of instabilities in thin films
is on the order of microns. In order to exploit this natural structure
formation process, it is important, first, to control the resulting
pattern and, second, to decrease the length scale to technologically
interesting feature sizes. Both requirements are fulfilled by imposing
a laterally heterogeneous electric field with variations smaller than
the intrinsic wavelength. Such a lateral field variation is typically
achieved by using a topographically structured mask as one of the
electrodes, thus enabling the generation of a broad variety of structures
on different length scales. EHL can be used to fabricate patterns
in a wide variety of polymers and composites using both featureless
and topographically structured masks.18 Patterning of thin films using electrohydrodynamic instabilities
possesses many desired characteristics and has convincingly been used
as a simple method to structure and replicate patterns of nonconducting,
dielectric polymers (e.g., polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl
methacrylate), polycaprolactone, nanocomposite carbon nanotubes integrated
in PS18) on submicrometer length scales targeting various applications. However, the applicability
of this technique to a new range of materials, that is, conductive
polymers, has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, EHL is shown to provide
a low-cost, high-resolution patterning of functional π-conjugated
polymers without compromising their properties and, therefore, enables
a tunable method to fabricate and control the position and dimensions
of the generated morphologies (by varying a number of experimental
parameters, such as the initial film thickness, interelectrode spacing,
applied voltage, surface tension, and lateral periodicity of the master
electrode) at a low-cost, but this high-throughput technique also
opens up a new avenue for patterning CPs targeting various applications
including FETs, LEDs, solar-cells, advanced sensors and microelectronics.

Results and Discussion
Owing to its high electroconductivity,
good stability in ambient
conditions, and facile processability, the intrinsically conducting
PPy polymer has been a topic of extensive research concurrently focusing
on practical applications and on synthesis. PPy can be synthesized
by electrochemical or chemical polymerization methods. One of the
main limiting factors has been its nonsolubility in any solvent due
to the strong intermolecular interactions of the heterocyclic planar
structure of PPy. Although electropolymerization yields predominantly
rough films, which inhibits PPy electronic functions, whereas chemical
polymerization results in insoluble powder. Because EHL
lithography requires homogeneous films for the patterning process,
an optimized synthesis of PPy19 has been
carried out in this study to prepare electroconductive PPy, which
is soluble in organic solvents and can be spin-coated into uniform
thin films. This process (described in the Methods Section) yielded 7% of pure PPy soluble in DMF, THF, m-cresol, and chloroform. The conductivity of the films was measured
to be 1.7 ± 0.5 S/m (spin-cast from chloroform). The synthesized
PPy was readily spin-cast into homogeneous films both on Si wafer
substrates and on indium tin-oxide (ITO) glass, which serve as bottom
electrodes during the patterning process. These conductive polymer
films were then subjected to the EHL patterning process.

The
physical mechanism of the EHL pattern formation process in
the case of a perfect dielectric is well understood.20,21 For EHL patterning of conductive polymers, however, free charges
in the film (which substantially modify the electric field distribution
in the film–air double layer) have to be taken into consideration.
The following discussion is based on the formalism proposed by Pease
and Russell13,14 for charge-driven electrohydrodynamic
patterning of leaky dielectric films.

The pattern selection
of EHL instabilities is given in terms of
a linear stability analysis for an incompressible Newtonian fluid
assuming the nonslip boundary condition at the substrate (Figure 1A). The destabilizing
electrostatic pressure, p scales with the square
of an applied voltage, U 1  with the capacitor electrode spacing, d, the dielectric permittivity of free space, ε0,
and the dielectric constant of the gap fluid, εg (which
is an air gap in our case, i.e.,
εg = ε1). The conductivity of the
leaky dielectric suppresses the electric field in the film and the
field in the gap drives the EHL pattern formation. This yields the
dimensionless conductivity, Σ representing the ratio of a time
scale for free charge conduction to the process time scale 2  where, γ
is a surface tension, σ
is a conductivity, and η is the viscosity of the polymer. With
the limit of Σ ≫ 1, (in our study Ef is on the order of 108) the most dominant (characteristic)
wavelength 3  is given by a force balance between
the destabilizing
electrostatic pressure due to the field in the gap acting on the polymer–air
interface with respect to the interfacial height, h0 and the γ acting to minimize the surface area,
thus suppressing the height variations. The characteristic time constant
for the instability is given by 4  

Figure 1 Schematic
representation of electrically driven patterning setup.
(A) Thin liquefied confined film develops characteristic undulations
at z = h0 while a constant
voltage, U is applied to between the electrodes (or
across the capacitor gap). Contact potentials at each interface give
rise to the electric field, Ef that drives
the flow. The dielectric constants of the film, ε and the gap
εg mediate the electrical forces from the applied
voltage. The electrostatic force is balanced by surface tension, γ
yielding the characteristic spacing, λ of the instability with
viscosity η. (B) Heterogeneous force field directs the instability
toward the protruding line structures and generates columnar-bridges
between the two electrodes, followed by a coarsening of the pillars
yielding in a positive replica of the master pattern in (C). In unstructured
regions, the film remains stable on a much longer time scale.

The EHL patterning process of
various structures is illustrated
in Figure 1A–C.
A topographically structured electrode induces an inhomogeneous electric
field in the capacitor gap. Initial instabilities are coupled to the
lateral field variation and further focused in the direction of the
highest electrostatic force. They are thus driven toward the downward
protruding structures of the top mask. This results in a pattern of
pillars spanning the capacitor gap at the locations of the smallest
interelectrode distances (Figure 1B), which by coalescence eventually generates a replicated
pattern of the upper electrode (Figure 1C). The final height of the polymer structures is dictated
by d and h0. Despite
the shorter destabilization time and faster growing modes of fully
conducting material compared to a prefect dielectric (minutes vs hours15,22), smaller accessible scale-sizes
(in the range of 100 nm (Figure 2A and D) vs the typical micrometer
arrays15,22,23) and greater
aspect ratios (e.g., 0.83 in Figure 2), the pattern formation process of Figure 1 is reminiscent of
the well-studied case of generic polymers,20,21,24 thus confirming the same underlying physical
mechanism. To note, EHL patterning has successfully taken place when
using a heterogeneous electric field that is formed by using a structured
rather than planar top electrode. Although for homogeneous Ef, patterning of CP was somewhat limited, by
using topographically structured top electrode, it was possible to
successfully modulate the electric field, decrease the characteristic
wavelength and increase the aspect ratio of the structures without
causing the electrical breakdown of the capacitor patterning device
due to high external voltages. When a laterally varying electric field
is applied to the capacitor device, the instability is focused in
the direction of the highest electric field and because the electrostatic
pressure is inversely proportional to a square of the capacitor gap,
it is considerably stronger for smaller interelectrode distances.

Figure 2 shows optical
microscopy (top) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (inset, height;
bottom, three-dimensional) images of line and column patterns obtained
after the application of a voltage to the capacitor device. Optical
micrographs reveal large areas comprised of conductive PPy patterns
exhibiting a range of feature sizes (Figure 2A–C). The cross-sectional AFM image
in Figure 2B reveals
a line height of 2.0 μm and a width of 2.5 μm. The length
scale of the EHL formed patterns is dependent on the feature size
of the structured electrode. A reduction in the topographically induced
feature size and an increased electrical potential (75 V) results
in PPy lines as small as 100 nm height and 120 nm width (Figure 2A). An additional
pattern of ordered columns has been generated using EHL patterning
after the application of 55 V between the electrodes. This has resulted
in a columnar structure with a typical height of 700 nm, a diameter
of 1.2 μm and a periodicity of 2 μm (Figure 2C). Apart from isolated defects,
the patterns of the master electrodes were reproduced with high fidelity
over the entire electrode area (typically 200 × 200 μm2).

microlines (B) and (E).

Dimensions of a semiconducting channel are known to have
a direct
impact on the device performance.25,26 The final
pattern morphology and its dimensions can be tuned by the specific
set of sample parameters. The pattern formation rate, the height and
the lateral dimensions (i.e., structures width and
spacing, and therefore, the aspect ratio) of the EHL generated patterns
can be controlled via adjustment of the applied voltage
(increasing U causes higher driving forces), the
initial film thickness, the interelectrode gap, and the surface tension.
Moreover, the imposed modulation periodicity of the structured electrode,
for which the amplitude can be adapted, not only plays an important
role in obtaining a faithful replication but also opens up a route
toward decreasing the patterns length scale to the sub-100 nm range.
In the presence of the laterally varying confinement, the liquid morphologies
are organized according to the ratio of the plate spacing and the
initial amount of polymer in the capacitor gap. Though the pattern
selection during the early stage of the process is a sinusoidal surface
undulation, for all samples, the filling ratio establishes the late
stage of pattern formation. The final morphology of the replicated
pattern is determined by the partial coalescence of the initial pattern.

The shape of the generated pattern depends on the ratio of the
intrinsic film undulation wavelength and the lateral periodicity of
the master electrode. Thus, sub-100 nm patterns with structure-to-structure
spacing on the order of 100 nm can be achieved with a leaky dielectric
by both exploiting conducting polymer as a film material and gap materials
that combine a low interfacial tension with the film with a high electric
strength.

shown in a top-view optical image (inset B,i) and gate voltage performance
(inset B,ii) of the PPy-FET described in (A).

Vertical FETs hold the potential to combine good performance
with
high device density. The application of vertical transistors in memory
devices is especially sought after due to its potential in shrinking
individual devices and capability of multilevel memory structures
three-dimensionally. In order to evaluate the electrolyte-gated vertical
FET performance, EHL-generated structure arrays were fabricated with
gate length of 700 nm and a pitch of 500 nm as schematically shown
in Figure 3A, top and
3B,i (top view optical microscopy image). Liquid-ion gate FET geometry
was constructed using a potassium chloride (KCl) solution and tungsten
needle as contacting electrode (Figure 3A). The electrical drain current (IDS)–drain voltage (VDS) characteristics of the device as a function of different gate voltages
(VG) are shown in Figure 3B. Inset ii of Figure 3B, presents the transfer characteristics
(source-drain current versus gate voltage, IDS–VG) at
a constant drain-source voltage (a representative value of VDS = 4 V). The positive gate voltages decrease
the current and the values of IDS increase
upon raising the positive VG at a negative VDS indicating that the devices exhibit p-type FET behavior with the holes being the major charge
carriers. This current modulation due to the modulation of carrier
density in the PPy structures along with the onset of the saturation
of drain-source voltage at approximately 9 V is consistent with the
measurements previously performed on other PPy-based transistors27,28 The maximum value of ISD of the transistor
was 20 mA in the 0.01 M KCl solution at VG = 20 V.

Furthermore, structured conductive polymer based substrates
exhibit
an increased electrochemically accessible surface area along with
the high electrical conductivity. They may be used to generate well-defined
electrical contacts and may provide a route for incorporating chemical
functions by functionalization along their longtinudal axis. This
is potentially useful for the development of rapid-response biochemical
sensors, which are selective for targeted chemical and biological
molecules. Additional optimization, currently underway, of the EHL
generated electroconductive submicron structures will enable devices
that can be used directly as arrays of electrodes to fabricate all
plastic FETs and biochemical sensors. Along with promising electrical
transistor characteristics, the use of low-cost lithographic technology
and simple gate definition process steps could make such devices suitable
candidates for next generation technology nodes.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a conducting polymer EHL patterning process is directly
performed on silicon substrates yielding high fidelity structures
with a range of feature scale sizes. Though patterning of PPy is a proof-of-concept, the versatile EHL patterning method can
be applied to a variety of CPs. The feasibility of a PPy-EHL-based
device as a FET is successfully demonstrated. With properly chosen
experimental parameters, combined with a suitable master electrode,
it should be possible to generate patterns with sub-100 nm widths
over very large areas. Submicrometer structured conducting polymers
possess improved properties and performance compared with bulk material
devices. These structures have potential for applications in the development
of microelectronics, displays, and biotechnological assemblies, such
as flexible display devices or bio and chemical sensors. For example,
high density electrically conducting microstructures can be directly
used as miniaturized sensors. The EHL approach can be further extended
to lateral complex or hierarchical structures consisting of bilayers
or larger numbers of different materials with set mismatched conductivities.

This is the first time that a conductive polymer has been patterned
using EHL technique. This method provides a promising route for a
straightforward and cost-effective large area patterning of CPs, opening
up many opportunities for high resolution and high throughput structures
with applications in nano- and biotechnology related fields and devices.

Methods
All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification. PPy soluble in organic solvents has been synthesized
(with slight modifications) following the procedure described in ref (19): 0.14 g of dried pyrrole
monomer was added to a solution comprised of 0.0745 mol of dodecylbenzenesulfonic
acid (DBSA) dissolved in 300 mL of deionized water (DW) and dynamically
stirred for 30 min. Then, 0.35 M of aqueous ammonium persulfate solution
was added to this mixture and left to react for 18 h under continuous
stirring. Addition of methanol stopped the reaction and the final
solution was filtered to obtain black PPy powder. The PPy was washed
several times with methanol and excess of DW followed by filtering,
eventually yiding pure PPY. The molecular weight of PPy was 157 kg/mol
and the glass transition temperature was 98 °C.

Highly
polished p-doped silicon (Si) wafers, with
⟨100⟩ crystal orientation (Wafernet Gmbh, Eching, Germany)
covered by 100 or 300 nm thick oxide layer were used as substrates.
Patterned silicon wafers were obtained from X-lith eXtreme Lithography,
Ulm, Germany). Chloroform (Fischer Inc.) was used as a main solvent.

Thin films were generated by spin-coating onto a silicon wafer
substrate (dimensions of 1 × 1 cm2) from chloroform
solution with typical concentrations of 2–3% polymer by weight.
Prior to spin-coating, the substrates were cleaned in a Piranha solution
consisting of 3:1 H2SO4 (98%):H2O2 (30%), followed by thorough rinsing with deionized water
and drying under nitrogen. To ensure the integrity of the formed structures,
patterned electrodes were rendered hydrophobic by the deposition of
a 1,1,1,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled
monolayer to reduce the adhesion between the mask and the polymer.
Thereafter, substrates as well as electrodes covering the films were
subjected to snow-jet cleaning immediately before film deposition
and device assembply. Facing it, a topographically structured electrode
was mounted at a specific distance using silicon oxide colloids as
spacers, leaving a thin air gap, d (between the mask
and the film, Figure 1A).

The spin-cast films were liquefied either by annealing
above the
softening temperature of the polymer or by exposing them to controlled
chloroform vapor atmosphere to induce chain mobility and facilitate
equilibration. The solvent vapor pressure was adjusted using a homemade
apparatus. Mass-flow controllers (MKS Instruments Model 1179A with
a PR4000F readout) regulated the flux of the carrier gas, N2 through two lines. In one line, the N2 was bubbled through
a solvent-filled bottle resulting in a solvent-saturated gas stream.
Both streams were mixed and passed through the sample chamber. The
flow volumes per time were individually regulated to values between
1 and 20 cm3 min–1. The vapor pressure
in the mixing chamber can be estimated by the ratio of the saturated
(psat) to dry gas (p)
flow as determined by the flow-meter readout. All tubes and connectors
were made from solvent-resistant materials (glass and Teflon). The
chamber and a regulated water bath containing the solvent bottle and
the mixing chamber were held at the same temperature. Typical values
for the vapor pressures were p = psat = 0:5/0:7. The films were allowed to swell in the
controlled solvent vapor atmosphere until they reached their equilibrium
thickness after around 30 min. This condition was determined by experiments
using a sample chamber lid with a window, providing optical access
to the chamber. Using a light microscope in reflection mode the change
in film thickness as a function of time was qualitatively monitored.
A voltage of 45–80 V was then applied between the two electrodes.
Cooling sample to RT, or removal of the solvent by passing dry nitrogen
through the sample chamber, solidified the polymer before the voltage
was removed, terminating the patterning process. After quenching the
samples to room temperature, the electric field was disconnected and
the upper electrode was removed.

The sample topography was analyzed
by optical microscopy and atomic
force microscopy. Olympus Optical Microscope GX61 was employed in
our experiments. The reflection of white light from the sample enabled
us to resolve submicrometer features. The acquired data in our experiments
is complemented by the in situ monitoring of EHL
pattern formation and replication in thin films, using a digital camera
and imaging software (Carl Zeiss VisioCam). AFM measurements were
performed using a Nanoscope IV Dimension 3100 (Veeco Instruments Inc.)
microscope operated in the tapping mode. Image processing and analysis
was carried out with the instrument software version V612r2 and V530r2.
NSG 20 cantilevers with a resonance frequency of 260 kHz and a stiffness
of 28 N m–1 were used. AFM measurements yielded
experimental parameters including the initial film thickness, the
lateral distances between the generated structures, and the structures’
heights and diameters.

The conductivity of the patterned film
was measured by a micromanipulator
(Micromanipulator Co., Serial No. 820243) with a 1 mm delicate probe
and 487 PicoAmmeter/voltage source (Keithley). The electrical measurements
of electrolyte gated transistors based on PPy structures in buffered
aqueous media of KCl at room temperature under ambient condition were
conducted by using a Keithley 2400 semiconductor source-meter and
a Wonatech WBCS 3000 potentiostat.
