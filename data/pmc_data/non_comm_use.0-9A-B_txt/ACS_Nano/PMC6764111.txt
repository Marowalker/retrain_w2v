The ability to confine
and to study single molecules has enabled
important advances in natural and applied sciences. Recently, we have
shown that unlabeled proteins can be confined inside the biological
nanopore Cytolysin A (ClyA) and conformational changes monitored by
ionic current recordings. However, trapping small proteins remains
a challenge. Here, we describe a system where steric, electrostatic,
electrophoretic, and electro-osmotic forces are exploited to immobilize
a small protein, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), inside ClyA. Assisted
by electrostatic simulations, we show that the dwell time of DHFR
inside ClyA can be increased by orders of magnitude (from milliseconds
to seconds) by manipulation of the DHFR charge distribution. Further,
we describe a physical model that includes a double energy barrier
and the main electrophoretic components for trapping DHFR inside the
nanopore. Simultaneous fits to the voltage dependence of the dwell
times allowed direct estimates of the cis and trans translocation probabilities, the mean dwell time,
and the force exerted by the electro-osmotic flow on the protein (≅9
pN at −50 mV) to be retrieved. The observed binding of NADPH
to the trapped DHFR molecules suggested that the engineered proteins
remained folded and functional inside ClyA. Contact-free confinement
of single proteins inside nanopores can be employed for the manipulation
and localized delivery of individual proteins and will have further
applications in single-molecule analyte sensing and enzymology studies.

Sensors capable
of the label-free
interrogation of proteins at the single-molecule level have applications
in biosensing, biophysics, and enzymology.1−3 In particular,
the ability to observe the behavior of individual proteins allows
one to directly retrieve the rates of kinetic processes and provides
a wealth of mechanistic, energetic, and structural information, which
are not readily obtained from statistically averaged ensemble (bulk)
measurements.1 To achieve single-molecular
sensitivity at high signal-to-noise ratios, the observational volume
of the sensor should be similar in size to the object of interest
(i.e., zeptoliter range for a protein with a radius
of 2.5 nm). Moreover, many kinetic processes have relatively long
time scales (e.g., 10–3 to 1 s)
which, in turn, necessitate long observational times to obtain a statistically
relevant number of events. Hence, the protein must also remain inside
the observational volume for seconds or minutes, a feat that is only
possible if the protein is either physically immobilized or trapped
in a local energetic minimum that is significantly deeper than the
thermal energy.4,5

To counteract the random
thermal motion of nanoscale objects in
solution, several optical, microfluidic, and nanofluidic methodologies
have been developed over the years. The optical trapping of nanoscale
objects (<50 nm radius) requires the sub-diffraction-limited confinement
of light,6−8 which can be achieved with photonic9,10 or plasmonic11−18 nanostructures. Although optical techniques have been shown to be
capable of trapping proteins with a radius of ≈2.3 nm,15 the high optical intensities required and the
solid-state nature of the devices tend to not only trap the proteins
but also unfold them, limiting the scope of their applicability.13,18

Microfluidic techniques might offer softer alternatives for
the
immobilization of single molecules. The anti-Brownian electrokinetic
(ABEL) trap makes use of optical tracking to electrophoretically counteract
the Brownian motion of individual dielectric particles,19−22 enabling the trapping of proteins down to ≈2.9 nm radius22 and even single fluorophores.23 Because this technique uses fluorescence microscopy to
track the movement of their targets, the observational time window
is ultimately limited by the photobleaching of the dye.19,21

Nanopores, which are nanometer-sized apertures in a membrane
separating
two electrolyte reservoirs, have been used extensively to study single
molecules.3,24−26 In nanopore analyses,
an electric field is applied across the membrane and information about
a molecule passing through the pore is collected by monitoring the
modulations of the ionic charge current. As proteins typically transit
the pore at high velocities (≈10–3 to 10–2 m·s–1),27−30 the dwell time (i.e., the duration a molecule of interest spends inside the observable
volume) is on the order of 10–6 to 10–3 s. These time scales have proven sufficient for obtaining structural
information such as protein size, shape, charge, dipole moment, and
rigidity,27,30−33 but they are too brief to efficiently
study the enzymatic cycle of the majority of human enzymes (turnover
numbers between 10–3 and 103 s–1).

To increase the observation window of proteins by nanopores,
researchers
have made extensive use of noncovalent interactions. By coating solid-state
nanopores with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) receptors, the dwell time
of His-tagged proteins could be prolonged up to 6 orders of magnitude.34 In another account, the diffusion coefficient
of several proteins was reduced 10-fold via tethering
to a lipid-bilayer-coated nanopore.35,36 The decoration
of biological nanopores with thrombin-specific aptamers enabled the
investigation of the binding kinetics of thrombin to its aptamer37 and the selective detection in the presence
of a 100-fold excess of noncognate proteins.38 Electrophoretic translocation of protein–DNA complexes through
small nanopores (<3 nm diameter) typically results in the temporary
trapping of the entire complex, which has allowed for the study of
polymerase enzymes39,40 and DNA-binding proteins.41,42 Although promising, none of these approaches could efficiently control
the trapping of the protein inside the nanopore or allow observation
of enzyme kinetics or ligand-induced conformational changes.

The energetic landscape of a protein translocating through a nanopore
stems directly from the electrostatic, electrophoretic, electro-osmotic,
and steric forces exerted on it.43 Given
the relatively high motility of proteins, the creation of a long lasting
(10–100 s), contact-free trap within a spatial region of a
few nanometers mandates the presence of a deep potential energy well
within the nanopore.44 Such a potential
profile was achieved by Luchian and co-workers, who showed that the
dwell time of a polypeptide inside the α-hemolysin pore could
be significantly increased by manipulating the strength of the electro-osmotic
flow45,46 or by placement of oppositely charged amino
acids at the polypeptide’s termini.47 In a similar approach, a single barnase enzyme was trapped inside
α-hemolysin via the addition of a positively
charged N-terminal tag.48

Previous
work in the Maglia group on protein analysis with nanopores
was centered around the biological nanopore Cytolysin A (ClyA)—a
protein with a highly negatively charged interior whose shape can
best be described by a large (≈5.5 nm diameter, ≈10
nm height, cis lumen) and a small (≈3.3 nm
diameter, ≈4 nm height, trans constriction) cylinder stacked on top of each other (Figure 1a).38,49 Upon capture from the cis side of the pore, certain proteins exhibited exceptionally
long dwell times inside ClyA from seconds up to tens of minutes,38,49−53 enabling the monitoring of conformational changes53−55 and even of
the orientation54 of the proteins inside
the nanopore. A subset of the investigated proteins, such as lysozyme,
Dendra2_M159A, and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), resided inside
the nanopore lumen only for hundreds of microseconds and hence could
not be studied.38,50 It was observed that the size
of the nanopore plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of protein
trapping, as a mere <10% increase of ClyA’s diameter (i.e., by using ClyA nanopores with a higher oligomeric state)
is enough to reduce the dwell time of proteins by almost 3 orders
of magnitude.49 Next to pore size, the
charge distribution of proteins can significantly affect their dwell
time inside a nanopore. For example, the binding of the negatively
charged (−2 e) inhibitor methotrexate (MTX)
to a modified DHFR molecule with a positively charged fusion tag at
the C-terminus (DHFRtag) increased the dwell time of the
protein inside the ClyA nanopore from ≈3 ms to ≈3 s
at −90 mV.50

lipid bilayer. The structure was derived through homology modeling
from the wild-type crystal structure (PDB ID: 2WCD(56)) using the MODELLER,57 VMD,58 and NAMD59 software

(DHFR) molecule extended with a positively charged C-terminal polypeptide
tag (DHFR4S) inside a ClyA-AS nanopore. The secondary structure
of the tag (primarily α-helical) was predicted by the PEP-FOLD
server.64,65 At negative applied bias voltages relative
to trans, the electric field (E⃗) is expected to pull the negatively charged body of DHFR upward
(Fepbody) and the positively charged fusion tag downward (Feptag), while the electro-osmotic flow pushes the entire protein downward
(Feo). Lastly, as the body of DHFR is
larger than the diameter of the trans constriction,
the force required to overcome the steric hindrance (Fster) during full cis-to-trans translocation is expected to be significant. (c) Sequence of DHFR4S fusion tag with its positive and negative residues colored

charge to the body and one positive charge to the tag, respectively.

In this work, the immobilization of individual Escherichia
coli DHFR molecules (Figure 1b) inside the ClyA biological nanopore (specifically
type I ClyA-AS,49Figure 1a) is investigated in detail. Using nanoscale
protein electrostatic simulations as a guideline, our results show
that the dwell time of DHFR4S—a molecule identical
to the above-mentioned DHFRtag aside from the insertion
of a single alanine residue at its fusion tag (A174_A175insA, Figure 1c)—inside
ClyA can be increased several orders of magnitude by manipulating
the distribution of positive and negative charges on its surface.
To elucidate the physical origin of the trapping mechanism, a double
energy barrier model was developed which—by fitting the voltage
dependency of the dwell times for various DHFR mutants—yields
direct estimates of the cis and trans translocation rates and the magnitude of force exerted by the electro-osmotic
flow on DHFR. Our method provides an efficient means to increase the
dwell time of the DHFR protein inside the ClyA nanopore and suggests
a general mechanism to tune the dwell time of other proteins, which
we believe has significant value for single-molecule sensing and analysis
applications.

Results and Discussion
Phenomenology of DHFR Trapped
Inside ClyA
To effectively
study the enzymes at the single-molecular level, one must be able
to collect a statistically significant number (i.e., typically hundreds) of catalytic cycles from the same enzyme. In
the case of the E. coli DHFR, which
has a turnover number of ≈0.08 s,67 this means that the protein must remain trapped inside the pore
for tens of seconds. However, as detailed above, such long dwell times
were only achieved for DHFR by adding a positively charged polypeptide
tag to the C-terminus of DHFR, together with the binding of the negatively
charged inhibitor methotrexate (MTX).50 Although these long dwell times are encouraging, the requirement
for MTX excludes the study of the full enzymatic cycle. Hence, using
these previous findings as a starting point, we aim to find out how
to prolong the dwell time of a tagged DHFR molecule inside the ClyA-AS
nanopore without the use of MTX and to understand the fundamental
physical mechanisms that determine the escape of DHFR from the pore.

The structure of DHFR4S, the tagged DHFR molecule used
as a starting point in this work, can be roughly divided into a “body”,
which encompasses the enzyme itself and has a net negative charge, Nbody = −10 e, and a
“tag”, which comprises the C-terminal polypeptide extension
and bears a net positive charge, Ntag =
+4 e (Figure 1b,c). To capture a tagged DHFR molecule, an electric field
oriented from cis to trans (i.e., negative bias voltage) must be applied across the
nanopore, which gives rise to an electro-osmotic flow pushing the
protein into the pore (Feo). The electrophoretic
force on the body (Fepbody) strongly opposes this electro-osmotic
force but is significantly weakened by the electrophoretic force on
the tag (Feptag), allowing the protein to be captured.38,50,55 As the body and tag of the DHFR
molecules bear a significant amount of opposing charges, it is likely
that the molecule will align itself with the electric field, where
the tag is oriented toward the trans side. In this
configuration, the body sits in the ClyA lumen and the tag is located
in or near the narrow constriction. Because the body (≈4 nm)
is larger than the diameter of the constriction (3.3 nm), the steric
hindrance between the body and the pore is expected to strongly disfavor
full translocation to the trans reservoir, giving
rise to an apparent “steric hindrance” force (Fster). Finally, Poisson−Boltzman electrostatic
calculations calculations showed that the negatively charged interior
of ClyA-AS creates a negative electrostatic potential within both
the lumen (≈−0.3 kBT/e) and the constriction (≈−1 kBT/e) of the
pore,60 which will result in disfavorable
and favorable interactions with the body and the tag, respectively.

Energy Landscape of DHFR in ClyA
To increase the dwell
time of DHFR—and to generalize our findings for other proteins—it
is necessary to understand how the forces exerted on DHFR inside the
pore behave as a function of the experimental conditions (e.g., charge distribution and applied bias). In the absence
of specific high affinity interactions, DHFR’s trapping behavior
should be chiefly determined by its electrostatic interactions with
the pore, whereas the external electrophoretic and electro-osmotic
forces can be viewed as modifications thereof. Hence, we will start
by investigating the molecule’s electrostatic energy landscape
within ClyA in equilibrium where the externally applied electric field
vanishes.

To this end, we used the adaptive Poisson–Boltzmann
solver (APBS) to compute the electrostatic energy of a simplified
bead-like-tagged DHFR molecule model as it moves through the pore
(Figure 2a,b; see Supporting Information section 2 for details).61−63,68 The bead-like model was chosen
such that its body’s size is small enough to pass the constriction
without necessitating conformational changes as these cannot be modeled
using APBS. Hence, this also means that the magnitude of maxima of
the electrostatic energy landscape, which occur when the bead model’s
charges come close to the pore’s charges, should be viewed
as indicative and not absolute.

Figure 2 Energy landscape of DHFR4S
inside ClyA. (a) Coarse-grained
model of DHFR4S used in the electrostatic energy calculations
in APBS. The body of DHFR consists of seven negatively charged (−1.43 e) beads (1.6 nm diameter) in a spherical configuration
(0.8 nm spacing), whereas the tail is represented by a linear string
of beads (1 nm diameter, 0.6 nm spacing), each holding the net charge
of three amino acids. (b) Electrostatic energy (ΔEes) resulting from a series of APBS energy calculations
where the coarse-grained DHFR4S bead model is moved along
the central axis of the pore. The distances Δxcis and Δxtrans refer to the distances between the energy
minimum near the bottom of the lumen (z = 3 nm) and
the maximum at, respectively, cis (z = 5.7 nm) and trans (z = 0.6 nm).
(c) Although every additional negative charge to the body of DHFR
increases the trans electrostatic barrier by 1.46 kBT, it has virtually no effect
on the cis barrier, which increases only by 0.04 kBT per charge. (d) Addition
of a single positive charge to DHFR’s tag affects the height
of the trans and cis much more similarly,
with increases of 0.875 kBT and 0.621 kBT per charge,
respectively.

Nevertheless, the energy profile
of the DHFRtag clearly
shows that there is a significant electrostatic barrier, ΔEestrans, to overcome when the body of the DHFR moves
through the constriction of the pore (Figure 2b). Moreover, we observed a second smaller
electrostatic barrier, ΔEescis, toward the cis side so that an energetic minimum exists inside ClyA
in which the molecule can reside. The size difference between these
two barriers clearly suggests that in the absence of an external force
(i.e., at 0 mV bias) the molecule will exit toward cis with overwhelming probability.

To estimate how
the charges on DHFR impact its dwell time, we modified
the number of charges in the body from −10 to −13 e and recomputed the energy landscape using APBS (Figure 2c). We found that
the electrostatic energy barrier toward cis was largely
unaffected (0.04 kBT increase
per negative charge), whereas the barrier for trans exit increased significantly (1.46 kBT increase per negative charge). The latter is a
reflection of the highly negatively charged and narrow trans constriction of ClyA.

Contrary to the body of DHFR, the modification
of the charge in
the tag from +4 to +9 e influenced the heights of
both the cis and the trans barrier
similarly, with increases of 0.621 kBT and 0.875 kBT per positive elementary charge, respectively (Figure 2d). This behavior can be explained by the
fact that, at DHFR’s equilibrium position within the pore,
the positively charged tag resides in the highly negatively electrostatic
well present in the trans constriction of the nanopore
(Figure 2b). Moving
the molecule from this position into either direction requires this
Coulombic attraction to be overcome, which is directly proportional
to the number of charges on the tag, irrespective of whether the molecule
moves toward cis or toward trans.

Note that when an external electric field is applied, the
electrophoretic
and electro-osmotic forces must be taken into account. If their net
balance is positive (i.e., a net force toward cis) or negative (i.e., a net force toward trans), the electrostatic landscape will be tilted upward
and downward, respectively (see Figure S3c). The capture of highly negative charged (−11 e) wild-type DHFR molecules against the electric field50 strongly indicates that the electro-osmosis
outweighs electrophoresis, and the energy landscape will be shifted
downward at trans, resulting in higher and lower
barrier heights at cis and trans, respectively. This effectively deepens the energy minimum, which
should manifest as an increase of DHFR’s dwell time.

Dwell
Time Measurements
The entry of a single protein
into ClyA results in a temporary reduction of the ionic current from
the “open pore” (I0) to
a characteristic “blocked pore” (Ib) level. Previously, we revealed that the DHFR protein shows
a main current blockade with Ires% = Ib/I0 ≈ 70%
(see Figure S4). However, occasionally
deeper blocks are observed, which most likely represent the transient
visit of DHFR to multiple locations inside the nanopore. Here, we
assume that the dwell time (td) is simply
given by the time from the initial capture to the final release where
the current level returns to the open-pore current.

After gathering
sufficient statistics for the dwell time events, we computed the expectation
value of td by taking the arithmetic mean
of all dwell time events. This is because the chance for an escape
can be modeled as the probability of overcoming a potential barrier
whose distribution function is exponential (see Supporting Information section 1). Note that even if the molecule
transitions through multiple meta-states with individual rates connecting
each of them before it exits, the expectation value is still given
by the arithmetic mean (see Supporting Information eq S12).

We observed before that the dwell time of tagged
DHFR molecules
depends strongly on the applied bias,55 that is, exponentially rising with voltage until a certain bias—which
we will refer to as the threshold voltage—followed
by an exponential fall. This behavior has also been observed for charged
peptides in α-hemolysin44 and is
typical for a decay of a bound state into multiple final states, such
as an escape to either cis or trans (see Supporting Information section 1).
Therefore, the dwell time of the molecule, as a function of bias voltage, Vbias, can be expressed as the inverse of the
sum of two escape rates:44 1  where kcis/trans are the molecule’s
escape rates toward cis and trans, respectively. These can be further decomposed into attempted frequencies k0cis/trans and bias-dependent barriers
in the exponentials. Although this equation can help to qualitatively
describe the experimental data, the reduction of the entire protein–nanopore
system to four parameters does not allow for their physical interpretation.

Engineering DHFR’s Dwell Time by Manipulation of Its
Charge
The results from the APBS simulations, together with
the previous work with DHFRtag and MTX,50 suggest that the dwell time of DHFR in ClyA can be increased
by the manipulation of its charge distribution. To achieve the increase
in dwell time without the need for MTX, several nonconserved amino
acids on the surface of DHFR4S were identified and mutated
to negatively charged glutamate residues, resulting in the molecules
DHFR4I, DHFR4C, DHFR4O1, and DHFR4O2 (Table 1 and Figure 3a). These
mutations modify the number of charges in the body compared to DHFR4S, and their charges are also in different locations. For
convenience, this series of mutations will be referred to as the body charge variations from here on out.

average dwell time (td) inside ClyA-AS
for DHFR mutants in (a). The solid lines represent the voltage dependency
predicted by fitting the double barrier model given by eq 1 to the data (see Table S4). The dotted lines represent the dwell times due
the cis (low to high) and trans (high
to low) barriers. The threshold voltages at the maximum dwell time
were estimated by inserting the fitting parameters into eq S25. The error envelope represents the minimum
and maximum values obtained from repeats at the same condition. All
measurements were performed at ≈28 °C in aqueous buffer
at pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM Tris-HCl. Current traces
were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered using a low-pass Bessel filter
with a 2 kHz cutoff.

We performed ionic current
measurements for all body charge variations
for a wide range of bias voltages (−40 to −120 mV; see Figures S4 and S5) and extracted the dwell times
as shown in Figure 3b. All body charge variations showed the same increase of the dwell
time at low electric fields and decreased at high fields. However,
we observed differences in the threshold voltage and the magnitude
of the maximum dwell time. These differences cannot simply be explained
by the total number of charges as DHFR4I and DHFR4C have the same charge as DHFR4O1, but their dwell times
are 10-fold lower (Figure 3b). This result implies that the location of the body charge
on DHFR plays an important role.

Additional body mutations could
potentially compromise the catalytic
cycle of DHFR. Hence, we proceeded by systematically increasing the
number of positive charges to the fusion tag (Ntag) of DHFR4O2, the variant that exhibited the
longest dwell time, via lysine substitution from
4 e to 9 e (Table 1 and Figure 4). The resulting DHFRNtagO2 mutants will be referred to as the tag charge variations.

all DHFRNtagO2 mutants going

tag have been annotated and highlighted in blue. (b) Voltage dependencies
of the mean dwell time (td) for the mutant

voltages were computed by Supporting Information eq S26. Solid lines represent the double barrier dwell time,
and the dotted lines show the dwell times due the cis (low to high) and trans (high to low) barriers.
Fitting parameters can be found in Table 2. The error envelope represents the minimum
and maximum values obtained from repeats at the same condition. Experimental
conditions are the same as those in Figure 3.

Subsequent characterization of their the dwell times revealed that
the addition of positive charges to the tag significantly increased
DHFR’s dwell time (Figure 4b). We observed a similar increase for DHFR4O1 variants with +5 and +7 tag charge numbers (see Figure S7). This behavior is consistent with the tag being
trapped electrostatically inside the negatively charged trans constriction,44,46,47,60 and it suggests that the tag plays a crucial
role in the trapping of DHFR, which was already observed in previous
work.50

Binding of NADPH Reveals
That DHFR Remains Folded Inside the
Pore
To verify that our DHFR variants remained folded inside
the nanopore, we measured and analyzed the binding of NADPH to the
enzyme. The addition of the NADPH cofactor to the trans solution of nanopore-entrapped DHFR molecules induced reversible
ionic current enhancements that reflect the binding and unbinding
of the cofactor to the protein (Figure 5a and Supporting Information Figure S6 and Table S3).

binding to confined DHFR molecule is reflected by current enhancements
from the unbound L1 to the NADPH-bound L1NADPH current
levels and showed association (kon) and
dissociation (koff) rate constants of
2.03 ± 0.58 × 106 M–1·s–1 and 71.2 ± 20.4 s–1, respectively
(see Table S3). (b) Dependence of the Ires% on the applied potential for DHFR7O2 and DHFR7O2 bound to NADPH. All current traces were
collected in 250 mM NaCl and 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 23 °C,
by applying a Bessel low-pass filter with a 2 kHz cutoff and sampled
at 10 kHz.

Not all DHFR variants were found
to be suitable for NADPH-binding
analysis: DHFR5O2 did not dwell long enough inside ClyA-AS
at −60 mV (td = 0.32 ± 0.17
s) to allow a detailed characterization of NADPH binding, whereas
NADPH-binding events to DHFR8O2 were too noisy for a proper
determination of kon and koff. No NADPH-binding events to DHFR9O2 could
be observed. NADPH-binding events to the other DHFR variants (DHFR5O2, DHFR6O2, and DHFR7O2) showed similar
values for kon, koff, and event amplitude (Table S3), suggesting that the binding of NADPH to DHFR inside the ClyA-AS
nanopore is not affected by the number of positive charges in the
C-terminal fusion tag. Possibly, the inability of DHFR8O2 and DHFR9O2 to bind the substrate is due the lodging
of DHFR closer to the trans constriction.

Work
with solid-state nanopores also previously reported that electric
fields inside a nanopore may unfold proteins during translocation,69 suggesting that the high degree of charge separation
between the body and tag of DHFR might destabilize its structure.
To further investigate the effect of the applied potential on the
protein structure, we analyzed the dependency of the residual current
on the applied potential (Figure 5). We found that the residual current of both the apo-DHFR
and the ligand-bound enzyme increased by ≈2.5% from −60
to −100 mV. A voltage-dependent change in residual current
is compatible with a force-induced stretching of the enzyme. However,
single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments showed that NADPH binding
increases the force required to unfold the protein by more than 3-fold
from 27 to 98 pN.70 As the change of residual
current over the potential was identical for both apo- and ligand-bound
DHFR (Figure 5), a
likely explanation is that, rather than stretching DHFR, the applied
bias changes the position of DHFR within the nanopore. Hence, our
data suggest that, as previously reported for several other proteins,52,53 the protein remains folded at different applied bias.

Double Barrier
Model for the Trapping of DHFR
Inspired
by the strong dependence of the dwell time on the tag charge, we set
out to understand the underlying trapping mechanism by building a
quantitative model. To this end, we will focus on the data set of
the dwell time of DHFRNtagO2
shown in Figure 4b.

We propose a double barrier model that describes the trapping of
the molecule as a combination of escape rates toward cis and toward trans (see Supporting Information section 1.3). Similar to eq 1, the dwell time is defined in terms of the
rate k, which in turn is given by the sum of the
rate for cis exit and the rate for trans exit. However, now we define the rates in terms of energy barriers: 2  where k0 is the attempt rate and ΔEcis/trans are the energy
barriers
the molecule has to overcome in order to escape toward cis and trans, respectively. These can be readily decomposed
into steric, electrostatic, and external contributions: 3a   3b  The steric components ΔEst,0cis/trans are defined as those interactions
of the molecule with the nanopore that are not electrostatic in nature,
such as size- or conformation-related effects as DHFR translocates
through the narrow constriction toward trans.

Supported by the APBS simulations (Figure 2b) and the corresponding barrier height to
tag charge dependency analyses (Figure 2d), we infer that the electrostatic components ΔEescis/trans can be further decomposed
as 4a   4b  where
ΔVtagcis/trans are
the electrostatic potentials associated
with the tag charge Ntag for the cis and trans barriers (i.e., the change in barrier height per additional charge in Ntag) and ΔEes,0cis/trans are two constant terms that combine all electrostatic interactions
between the protein and the pore that do not depend on Ntag (e.g., body-charge-related interactions
with the electric fields in the nanopore).

The external forces
acting on a protein trapped inside ClyA under
applied bias voltages manifest in the barrier contribution ΔEexcis/trans. They comprise an electrophoretic component ΔEepcis/trans and an electro-osmotic component ΔEeocis/trans. The former results from the strong electric
field (≈3.5 × 106 V·m–1 at −50 mV) and the nonzero net charge on the molecule, whereas
the latter springs from the force exerted by ClyA’s electro-osmotic
flow, which is strong enough to allow the capture of negatively charged
proteins even in opposition to the electrophoretic force.38,49,50,55 If it is assumed that the bias potential changes linearly over the
length of the pore, the external energy barriers are given by (see Supporting Information section 1) 5a   5b  where Nnet = Nbody + Ntag is the total number
of charges on DHFR, L is the length of the nanopore
(14 nm), and Vbias is the negative applied
bias. The strength of the electro-osmotic
force is defined by the equivalent osmotic charge number Neo—the number of charges that must be added to
DHFR to create an equal electrophoretic force on the molecule. Defining
the electro-osmotic force in terms of an equivalent osmotic charge
number reveals its complete analogy to an electrophoretic force, which
has the benefit that the magnitudes of both forces can be readily
compared. Moreover, the equivalent osmotic charge number is an invariant
related solely to the size and shape of the molecule.

The quantities
Δxcis/trans are defined as the distances from the
electrostatic energy minimum to the cis and trans barriers, which depend on the energetic landscape
of ClyA and on the precise location of residence of DHFR within the
pore. To estimate these values, we can use the APBS simulations (Figure 2b) from which we
can read that Δxtrans ≈ 3.5 nm. The cis distance is more
difficult to define as the cis electrostatic barrier
is much shallower. Without external fields, it has a distance of about
≈2.7 nm, but as we can see in Figure S3c, when the energy landscape is tilted by an external force, the barrier
that needs to be overcome is actually located at the cis entrance of the pore. In practice, Δxcis will need to be adjusted to a value between these two possibilities
to give an adequate estimate and hence will be left as a fitting parameter.

Inserting eqs 3–5 into eq 2 yields the final dwell time model: 6  where the static terms are
absorbed into the prefactor to form the effective cis and trans barrier attempt rates keffcis/trans. The formulation of eq 6 offers a compact description of
the most salient features of the molecule–nanopore system,
and it enables us to describe the dwell time of DHFR inside ClyA quantitatively
as a function of the physical properties of the system. Fitting this
model to all DHFRNtagO2 data simultaneously—with both Vbias and Ntag as independent variables—leads
to the fitting values in Table 2 and the plots in Figure 4b, which show excellent accuracy
considering the simplicity of our model. This is a strong indication
that we captured the essence of the trapping mechanism within our
model.

Characteristics
of the Trapping
As the double barrier
model of eq 6 is derived
from the underlying physical interactions of the molecule with the
nanopore and with the externally applied field, the fitted parameters
of Table 2 are physically
relevant quantities that describe the characteristics of the system.

The sizes of the electrostatic barriers ΔVtagcis/trans that the tag charges experience are
in direct relation to the gradients of the barrier sizes computed
using the APBS model (Figure 2d). We find that the change of the trans barrier
with respect to tag charge, ΔVtagtrans = 0.860 kBT,
is in excellent agreement with the simulated gradient of 0.875 kBT/e. The
change observed for the cis barrier, ΔVtagcis = 0.218 kBT/e, is approximately 3-fold smaller compared
to its APBS value of 0.621 kBT/e. This deviation likely results from the shallowness
of the cis barrier, causing it to disappear when
the energy landscape is tilted under an applied bias voltage (see Figure S3b). This gives rise to a cis barrier that lies at a location further away from the electrostatic
minimum located inside the trans constriction, effectively
limiting the influence of the tag charge number on the barrier height.
This claim is further corroborated by the finding that the fitted
value of Δxcis ≈ 5.2 nm,
which is almost twice the distance predicted by the APBS simulations
and moves that cis barrier much closer to the cis entry.

One of the key insights we obtain from
our model is the ability
to directly extract information on the strength of the osmotic flow.
However, let us first observe that the equivalent electro-osmotic
charge number Neo ≈ 15.5 is much
bigger than the net charge of all tag charge variations, Ntag + Nbody = −9, ...,
−4, and also has the opposite sign. This is in agreement with
the earlier assumption that the electro-osmotic force is strong enough
to overcome the opposing electrophoretic force and is hence responsible
for the capture of the molecule.38,50 At a bias
of Vbias = −50 mV, the electro-osmotic
force exerted onto the DHFR molecule, as computed by eq S21, is 7  The magnitude of this force
is in line with those found experimentally for DNA71−73 and proteins74 in solid-state nanopores.

We found the
threshold voltages—obtained from the fitted
model—to be roughly linearly dependent on the number of tag
charges, with a decrease of ≈5 mV per additional positive charge
(Figure 6a). This effect
is caused by the increase of the net external force on the molecule
with increasing tag charge, resulting in a simultaneous lowering of
the trans barrier and raising the cis barrier.

Figure 6 Tag charge dependence of the threshold voltage and translocation
probability. (a) Every additional positive charge in the fusion tag
of the DHFRNtagO2 variants
increases the threshold voltage (see Supporting Information S26) by ≈5.21 mV. The solid line is a linear
fit to the data. (b) Translocation probability voltage VPtranslbias plotted against tag charge for Ptransl = 0.1, 5, 50, 95 and 99.9% shows that
variants with high tag charge require less bias voltage to fully translocate
the pore. Values were obtained through interpolation from eq 8, using the parameters
in Table 2.

Another important finding of our model is that the DHFR variations
are essentially trapped by the electrostatic forces of the pore on
the tag. This can be seen from the direct exponential dependence of
the electrostatics on the tag charge as shown in eq 4. If the molecule was trapped
as a whole between two barriers, we would rather see a dependence
on the net charge on the molecule. Indeed, we verified that such a
net charge dependence cannot be fitted to the data.
This suggests that the tag acts as an anchor which is located in the
electrostatic minimum created by the trans constriction
(Figure 2a).

We can also determine the probability of a full translocation of
DHFR using 8  where kcis and ktrans can be computed
using the individual components given by eq 6 and the parameters in Table 2. At zero bias and zero tag charge, we find
that only 0.002% of DHFR molecules would exit to the trans side, indicating that in the absence of an electrophoretic driving
force a cis exit is much more likely than a trans exit. This is in agreement with our expectations because
DHFR’s size leads to a significant steric hindrance when it
tries to translocate through the nanopore constriction.

Finally,
from eq 8, we can compute
the voltage VPtranslbias required to
obtain a given translocation probability (Figure 6). The number of tag charges
significantly lowers the voltage required to achieve full translocation,
for example, VPtranslbias for Ptransl = 99.9 decreases from −130 mV
to −85 mV going from Ntag = +4
to +9. This effect is mainly due to the lowering of the trans barrier height, as the cis escape probability voltage
(0.01% line in Figure 6) only changes from −40 mV to −35 mV going from +4
to +9 tag charges. Hence, the higher the tag charge number, the stronger
the net external force which pushes the molecule through the trans constriction of the pore.

Conclusions
We
showed previously that neutral or weakly charged proteins larger
than the trans constriction (>3.3 nm) of ClyA
can
be trapped inside the nanopore for a relatively long duration (seconds
to minutes) and that their behavior can be sampled by ionic current
recordings.38,49,50,54,55 In contrast,
small proteins rapidly translocate through the nanopore due to the
strong electro-osmotic flow, and highly negatively charged proteins
remain inside ClyA only briefly or they do not enter at all.38

In this work, we use DHFR as a model molecule
to enhance and investigate
the trapping of small and negatively charged proteins inside the ClyA
nanopore.55 DHFR (3.5–4 nm) is slightly
too large to pass through the trans constriction,
and its negatively charged body (Nbody = −13 e) only allowed trapping the protein
inside the nanopore for a few milliseconds. The introduction of a
positively charged C-terminal fusion tag partially counterbalanced
the electrophoretic force and introduced an electrostatic trap in
the trans constriction of ClyA that increased the
DHFR dwell time up to minutes.

The DHFR mutants showed a biphasic
voltage dependency which was
explained by using a physical model containing a double energy barrier
to account for the exit on either side of the nanopore. The model
contained steric, electrostatic, electrophoretic, and electro-osmotic
components, and it allowed us to describe the complex voltage-dependent
data for the different DHFR constructs. Furthermore, fitting to experimental
data of a series of DHFRNtagO2 constructs, in which the positive charge of the tag was systematically
increased, enabled us to deduce meaningful values for DHFR’s
intrinsic cis and trans translocation
probabilities as well as an estimate of the force exerted by the electro-osmotic
flow on the protein of 0.178 pN·mV–1 (e.g., 9 pN at −50 mV, Table 2). We also showed that the APBS simulation
results of a simple bead model for the molecule are directly related
to the independently fitted parameters of the double barrier model.
In conclusion, this means that it should be possible to predict the dwell times of similar experiments by obtaining parameters directly
from these types of APBS simulations.

The double barrier model
of eq 6 in its current
form does not adequately describe the
mutations that modify the body charge distribution of DHFR. This is
most likely because body charge variations close to the electrostatically
trapped tag will impact the height of the barriers more strongly than
modifications on the far end of the tag. Although a model accounting
for this effect could be made, it would also make the double barrier
model significantly more complex without providing any significant
advantages over a more comprehensive atomistic simulation. A more
detailed discussion can be found in the Supporting Information section 4.

Inside the lumen of ClyA, proteins
are able to bind to their specific
substrates at all applied potentials tested (up to −100 mV),
indicating that the electrostatic potential inside the nanopore and
the electrostatic potential originating from the inner surface of
the nanopore did not unfold the protein. Therefore, our results indicate
that ClyA nanopores can be used as nanoscale test tubes to investigate
enzyme function at the single-molecule level. Compared to the wide
variety of single-molecule techniques based on fluorescence, nanopore
recordings are label-free, which have the advantage of allowing long
observation times.

The electrophoretic trapping of proteins
inside nanopores is likely
to have practical applications. For example, arrays of biological
or solid-state nanopores will allow the precise alignment of proteins
on a surface. In addition, proteins immobilized inside glass nanopipettes
atop a scanning ion conductance microscope75,76 can be manipulated with nanometer-scale precision, which might be
used, for instance, for the localized delivery of proteins. Furthermore,
ionic current measurements through the nanopore can be used for the
detection of analyte binding to an immobilized protein, which has
applications in single-molecule protein studies and small analyte
sensing.

Materials and Methods
Electrostatic Energy Landscape
Computation
The electrostatic
energy landscape of a coarse-grained DHFR molecule translocating through
a full-atom ClyA model was computed using the adaptive Poisson–Boltzmann
solver (APBS).61 The full procedure is
described in the Supporting Information section 2. In summary, a full atom model of ClyA-AS60 was prepared via homology modeling with
the MODELLER software package57 from the
wild-type ClyA crystal structure (PDB ID: 2WCD(56)), and its
energy was further minimized using the VMD58 and NAMD programs.59 A coarse-grained
bead model of DHFR—consisting of a “body” of
seven negatively charged beads in a spherical configuration and a
“tail” of nine smaller beads in a linear configuration
with varying charge—was placed a various locations along the
central axis of the pore using custom Python code and the Biopython
package.77 Each atom in the resulting ClyA–DHFR
complexes was subsequently assigned a radius and partial charge (according
to the CHARMM36 force-field78) with the
PDB2PQR program,62,63 and the electrostatic energy
was computed with APBS. The net electrostatic energy cost or gain
of placing a DHFR molecule at a given location inside ClyA (ΔGpore+part) is then given by 9  with Gpore+part, Gpore, and Gpart being the total electrostatic energies
of the ClyA–DHFR
complex, the empty ClyA pore, and only the DHFR molecule, respectively.

Protein Mutagenesis, Overexpression, and Purification
All
DHFR variants were constructed, overexpressed, and purified using
standard molecular biology techniques,50,55 as described
in full detail in the Supporting Information section 5.2. Briefly, the DHFR4S DNA construct was built
from the pT7-SC1 plasmid containing the DHFR-tag construct50 by inserting an additional alanine residue at
position 175 (located in the fusion tag) with site-directed mutagenesis.
All other variants were derived—again using site-directed mutagenesis—either
directly from DHFR4S or from a variant thereof. The plasmids
of each DHFR variant were used to transform E. cloni EXPRESS BL21(DE3)
cells (Lucigen, Middleton, USA), and the DHFR proteins they encode
were overexpressed overnight at 25 °C in a liquid culture. After
the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, the overexpressed
proteins were released into solution through lysis—using a
combination of at least a single freeze–thaw cycle, incubation
with lysozyme, and probe–tip sonification. Finally, the DHFR
proteins were purified from the lysate with affinity chromotography
with Strep-Tactin Sepharose (IBA Lifesciences, Goettingen, Germany),
aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C until further use.

ClyA-AS
Overexpression, Purification, and Oligomerization
ClyA-AS
oligomers were prepared as described previously,49 and full details can be found in the Supporting Information section 5.2. Briefly,
the ClyA-AS monomers were overexpressed and purified in a manner similar
to that for DHFR, with the largest difference being the use of Ni-NTA-based
affinity chromotography. After purification, ClyA-AS monomers were
oligomerized in 0.5% β-dodecylmaltoside (GLYCON Biochemicals
GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany) at 37 °C for 30 min. The type I oligomer
(12-mer) was isolated by gel extraction from a blue native PAGE.

Electrical Recordings in Planar Lipid Bilayers
Electrical
recordings of individual ClyA-AS nanopores were carried out using
a typical planar lipid bilayer setup with an AxoPatch 200B (Axon Instruments,
San Jose, USA) patch-clamp amplifier.38,79 Briefly, a
black lipid membrane consisting of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, USA) was
formed inside a ≈100 μm diameter aperture in a thin polytetrafluoroethylene
film (Goodfellow Cambridge Limited, Huntingdon, England), separating
two electrolyte compartments. Single nanopores were then made to insert
into the cis side chamber (grounded) by addition
of 0.01–0.1 ng of preoligomerized ClyA-AS to the buffered electrolyte
(150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). All ionic currents were sampled
at 10 kHz and filtered with a 2 kHz low-pass Bessel filter. A more
detailed description can be found in the Supporting Information section 5.4.

Dwell Time Analysis and
Model Fitting
The dwell times
of the DHFR protein blocks were extracted from single-nanopore channel
recordings using the “single-channel search” algorithm
of the pCLAMP 10.5 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) software suite.
The process was monitored manually, and any events shorter than 1
ms were discarded. We processed the dwell time data and fitted the
double barrier model to it, using a custom Python code employing the
NumPy,80 pandas,81 and lmfit82 packages. More details can
be found in the Supporting Information sections
5.4 and 5.5.
