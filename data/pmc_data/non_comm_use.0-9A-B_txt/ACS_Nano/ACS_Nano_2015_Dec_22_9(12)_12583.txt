An inconsistent boundary condition in eq 2 was corrected. This change does not in any way alter the results or the conclusions of the paper.

Page 1549, column 1, line 11. The text reads as follows:

“In Laplace space, each transition is modeled with a Heaviside step function, Rp(s) = ΔRp/s, where ΔRp is the instantaneous change in pore resistance, per unit time. We can obtain an expression for the nanopore current response of a single transition by substituting eq 1 into I(s) = Va/Z(s) and simplifying 2  where α = (1/ΔRp + Cm)Va and τ = (Rcis + Rtrans)(1/ΔRp + Cm). The inverse Laplace transform of eq 2, yields an exponentially decaying time-domain current response 3  where i0 is the open channel current offset.”

It should be replaced with the following:

“The circuit response for each transition (with characteristic pore resistance Rp) is modeled with a voltage step, Va(s) = Va/s. From eq 1 and Ohm’s law, the ionic current is then I(s) = Va(s)/Z(s). Upon simplification 2  where a = Va/(Rcis + Rtrans), b = 1/(RpCm), and τ = RpCm(Rcis + Rtrans)/(Rp + Rcis + Rtrans). The inverse Laplace transform of eq 2 yields an exponentially decaying time-domain current response 3  where α = a(1 – bτ) and i0 = abτ is the open channel current offset.”
