Carbon
nanotubes hold vast potential for device innovations because
their optical and electronic properties can be synthetically tailored
at a length scale unattainable by lithographic techniques. However,
lithographic patterning of carbon nanotubes with electronic-type control
remains one of the major problems for the integration of these nanomaterials
for practical device applications. In this work, we propose a laser
lithography method for direct-write patterning of devices on thin
films of outer wall selectively functionalized double-walled carbon
nanotubes (Tube^2). This method is enabled by the reversible removal
of surface functional groups with a laser tuned into resonance with
the inner tube of Tube^2. We show that it is possible to directly
create patterned dot arrays and conductive pathways and circuits on
insulating Tube^2 thin films by tuning the resonance of the direct-writing
laser with the electronic type of the inner tube (i.e., metallic or semiconducting). The successful patterning was unambiguously
confirmed with in situ Raman spectral imaging and
electrical characterization. This work suggests the possibility of
developing a nanostructure-specific nanofabrication technology reminiscent
of thermal printing.

==== Body
Carbon nanomaterials,
such as
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene, possess remarkable
optical,1 electrical,2 and mechanical properties,3 which
hold vast potential for innovation in biotechnology,4 electronic,5,6 optoelectronic,7 and other applications.8 In
recent decades, photolithography has been commonly used to pattern
extremely small features, producing increasingly sophisticated integrated
circuits. However, in the case of CNTs, the critical issues of the
mixed populations of and limited control on CNT electronic structures9 (i.e., metallic or semiconducting)
prevent circuits from being turned off completely, creating the necessity
for a patterning technique with both high spatial precision as well
as structural and electronic-type selectivity.10,11 Powerful CNT sorting strategies have been developed for achieving
high semiconductor yields,12−15 but combination of these sorting techniques with
existing patterning technology is often lengthy and it is difficult
to integrate both semiconducting and metallic nanostructures within
the same device.16,17 Other innovative patterning techniques
that combine patterning of CNTs with electronic specificity, such
as directed assembly16 and guided growth,18 have also been proposed. Each of these methods
possesses distinct advantages but is still too sophisticated for practical
applications. For instance, while directed assembly is capable of
creating structure-specific patterns, it necessitates the substrate
to be prepatterned physically and chemically, requiring extensive
lithography and chemical synthesis steps.16 On the other hand, guided growth produces highly aligned arrays
of CNTs but often utilizes quartz substrates that are not suitable
for electronics fabrication, therefore requiring cumbersome transfer
processes.19 A simple, scalable, and rapid
technique for integrating CNTs into electronic devices remains an
unmet, challenging goal.

In this study, we demonstrate a CNT
lithography method that is
capable of patterning both semiconducting channels and electrically
conductive pathways directly on an insulating nanotube thin film.
This method is enabled by a tube-in-a-tube (Tube^2) structure, which
was created synthetically through outer tube selective functionalization
of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs).20,21 Nonfunctionalized DWCNT thin films (pristine) are normally conductive,
with a sheet conductance of 5–75 μS for metallic films20 and an electron mobility of 1.5 cm2 V–1 s–1 for semiconducting films,17 but functional groups that are covalently attached
to the outer tube of Tube^2 prevent electrical contact between the
individual nanostructures, making the nanotube thin film insulating.22 By optical excitation of the Tube^2 with a laser
tuned to the resonance of the electronic transitions of the inner
tube, the functional groups on the outer tube, where the excited inner
tube is nested, are selectively removed (Figure 1a). The removal of the surface functional
groups restores the DWCNT structure and reinstates π-conjugation,
thus a conductive pathway can be generated in the otherwise insulating
thin film. By this direct-write method, it is possible to directly
create functional electronic circuits in thin films, as unambiguously
confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and electrical characterization. By
using two different lasers that selectively excite metallic and semiconducting
inner tubes, we show that both metallic and semiconducting patterns
can be created, suggesting a possible path to overcome the critical
barrier toward the integration of CNTs for electronics applications.

Results and Discussion
Tube^2 was synthetically created
from DWCNTs by selectively functionalizing
the outer tube with 4-nitrobenzenediazonium salt, as we previously
reported,20 to the exclusion of the inner
tube. The sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant that had been used
to suspend the DWCNTs in aqueous solutions for the reaction was subsequently
removed by vacuum filtration to make a thin film of Tube^2. The visible–NIR
absorption spectra of the Tube^2 thin film confirmed that both the
E11 and E22 inner tube absorption features remain
after the diazonium reaction, while the outer tube E11 absorption
greatly diminished compared with the nonfunctionalized DWCNT control
(Figure 1b), suggesting
successful functionalization of the outer tube selectively.

Raman spectroscopy also corroborated this conclusion (Figure 1c). A DWCNT is composed
of one SWCNT nested within another; each tube gives rise to a set
of Raman spectral features, including the radial breathing modes (RBM,
100–350 cm–1), the tangential mode (G peak,
∼1590 cm–1), and the disorder mode (D peak,
∼1350 cm–1). The DWCNTs used in this study
have two sets of RBMs, which are assigned to the outer (RBMouter, 100–200 cm–1, diameter ∼1.61 nm)
and inner tubes (RBMinner, 240–350 cm–1, diameter ∼0.86 nm).23 Upon covalent
sidewall functionalization of a DWCNT that converts it to Tube^2,
both the RBMouter and G peak of the outer tube diminished
and the D peak intensity concomitantly increased due to the incorporation
of sp3 defects on the outer tube (Figure S1). Using a laser to optically remove functional groups produces
annealed DWCNT (a-DWCNT), we observed the successful
removal of the aryl groups from the outer tubes, as shown by the recovery
of the RBMouter and G peak, as well as by the concomitant
decrease of the D peak intensity (Figure 1c). Removal of aryl groups from Tube^2 was
also observed for −C6H4Br under the same
conditions (excitation wavelength, exposure time, and power density),
suggesting that this technique can be generally utilized to remove
different functional groups (Figure S2).

We found that selective defunctionalization of the outer tube of
Tube^2 required a threshold power density (Figure 2a), below which structural recovery to the
DWCNT does not occur despite extended exposure to the 532 nm laser
(Figure 2b). Below
this threshold power density, the RBMouter features were
not recovered. This threshold feature allows us to characterize the
annealed films with in situ Raman spectroscopy by
operating beneath the power threshold to ensure that defunctionalization
does not occur. The existence of a threshold power density can be
partially understood by the balance of laser-induced heating and heat
dissipation. The inner tube of a Tube^2 converts photons to heat efficiently,
while the substrate acts as a heat sink. The energy at the sharp transition
in Figure 2a resembles
the minimum power density required to locally defunctionalize Tube^2,
structurally recovering the structure of DWCNT, the Tube^2 precursor.
When the laser power density is higher than the threshold energy,
resonant excitation of the inner tube defunctionalizes the outer tube,
and the extent of defunctionalization increases linearly as a function
of irradiation time until 20 s, at which point ∼50% defunctionalization
efficiency is achieved, followed by a negative exponential decay function
with τ = 13 s. By 50 s, the defunctionalization approached ∼95%
completeness (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Defunctionalization of Tube^2 only occurs above a threshold of
laser power density. (a) RBM intensity of outer tube versus the laser power density illustrates the existence of a threshold
power density for defunctionalization of Tube^2 within a thin film.
The laser used here is a 532 nm Ar+ laser with an irradiation
time of 50 s. The inset shows the spectral evolution of the Raman
RBM mode of the outer tube as a function of the laser irradiation
time at both below (red circle, 35 mW/μm2) and at
the power density threshold (blue circle, 59 mW/μm2). (b) RBM intensity of the outer tube is plotted as a function of
the irradiation time for a laser power density that is below the threshold
(red, corresponding to the red point in (a)) or above the threshold
(blue, corresponding to the blue spot in (a)).

We further observed that this defunctionalization from Tube^2
is
specific to its structure. Raman scattering shows that irradiation
of Tube^2 by a 532 nm laser recovered its outer tube RBM peak, while
under the same irradiation power and duration, a similarly functionalized
SWCNT (f-SWCNT) thin film remained flat (Figure S3). We attribute this distinct difference to the presence
of nonfunctionalized inner tube in Tube^2, which can be optically
excited to defunctionalize the outer tube, while for f-SWCNT, functionalization
of the lone nanotube resulted in the loss of the optical transitions
that were needed to facilitate resonance-enhanced annealing. This
control experiment confirms that the nonfunctionalized inner tube
within Tube^2 is an enabling element for the observed laser-induced
selective defunctionalization.

The hypothesis that the nonfunctionalized
inner tube is essential
for laser-induced defunctionalization is corroborated by evidence
that only selected outer tube populations are annealed when a particular
inner tube chirality is excited (Figure 3). Each DWCNT has a pair of RBM peaks from
the outer and inner tubes, whose positions are inversely proportional
to tube diameter.24,25 When creating Tube^2 synthetically
from a pristine DWCNT precursor solution, the outer tube of the DWCNT
is selectively functionalized, resulting in the RBMouter peaks being greatly diminished. This process occurs to all of the
outer tube chiralities (both red and gray peaks) within a mixture.
However, when these Tube^2 structures were annealed with a 532 nm
laser, only the red-shaded RBMouter (160 cm–1) peak was restored whereas the gray-shaded RBM (147 cm–1) peak was not.

Figure 3 Raman spectral evidence of inner tube selectivity. The
RBMs of
pristine DWCNT, Tube^2, and a-DWCNT samples are shown for direct comparison.
The top panel displays a Kataura plot in the resonant window of the
532 nm excitation. The laser excitation energy is marked by the solid
green line, and the window of resonant excitation is defined by the
pair of dashed green lines. In the Raman spectra, the peak in the
RBMouter region was deconvoluted into two Lorentzian peak
shapes, which are shaded in red and gray for clarity. The possible
chiralities for each outer and inner tube peak are highlighted in
the Kataura plot.

The observed selective
defunctionalization of a particular outer
tube population can be understood based on resonant Raman excitation.
The single Raman peak within the inner tube region is located at the
269 cm–1 peak, and the possible chiralities are
(9,3) and (10,1) based on the Kataura plot. Since the (9,3) is located
at the very edge of the resonance window, the 269 cm–1 peak should be predominantly due to the (10,1) chirality, which
has a diameter of 0.825 nm. Given the van der Waals spacing in the
DWCNTs investigated here (∼0.36 nm),20,23 the outer tube diameter associated with the (10,1) inner tube should
be ∼1.55 nm, which translates to an RBMouter peak
at ∼160 cm–1. Based on this assignment, the
outer tube associated with the red-shaded peak at ∼160 cm–1 is part of DWCNT structures containing the (10,1)
inner tube. This is strong evidence that for defunctionalization to
occur in an outer tube, the inner tube nested within it must be optically
excited. This conclusion is corroborated by the lack of defunctionalization
for the gray-shaded population of outer tubes (d ∼
1.68 nm), whose inner tubes are not optically resonant with the 532
nm laser wavelength. Although the gray peak outer tube is also in
resonance with the 532 nm laser, the associated inner tube for this
outer tube is not in resonance. Therefore, the gray Raman peak disappears
upon functionalization and does not recover by the 532 nm laser annealing.

In contrast, selective annealing of the outer tube may occur even
more efficiently when both the inner tube and the recovering outer
tube can be resonantly excited by the same laser, as evidenced by
the synchronous increase of RBM intensity for both inner and outer
tubes of the defunctionalized structures (Figure S4). The increase in RBM intensity for the inner tubes is not
expected but may be due to functionalization-induced modification
of the strong intrastructural coupling between inner and outer tubes
of a nonfunctionalized DWCNT structure.26−28

We attribute the
observed defunctionalization of Tube^2 to thermal
annealing effects.29 Tour et al. have demonstrated with thermogravimetric analysis that the temperature
needed to thermally detach aryl groups from the CNT lattice is 400–500
°C.30 Although it is difficult to
determine the exact defunctionalization temperature for Tube^2, qualitative
evidence of thermal heating at increasing irradiation power densities
can be derived from in situ Raman downshifts in G
peak position (Figure S5). Right below
the threshold power density, a downshift by 6–8 cm–1 was observed, corresponding to a temperature of ∼400–500
°C for locally excited nanotubes based on previous temperature-dependent
Raman studies by Zhang et al. and Xie et
al.(31,32) Even upon defunctionalization,
which provides a second Gouter contribution
at high wavenumbers, the left shoulder peak corresponding to the Ginner shifts to lower wavenumbers in correlation
to higher laser power densities. Furthermore, it has been shown that
a high power density laser, such as that used here, is capable of
heating CNTs to 300–800 °C.33,34 Additionally,
the annealing exhibited a strong dependence on the Tube^2 film thickness.
We found that for a thicker film, a lower power density was required
to induce laser writing (Figure S6). For
thicker Tube^2 thin films, it is more difficult to selectively defunctionalize
the intended outer tube chiralities, while thinner Tube^2 films were
much easier to control. We hypothesize that this difference is a result
of heat transfer within the nanotube network. At a higher nanotube
density, more inner tubes are available to absorb and dissipate the
heat, and there is also a greater amount of tube–tube interactions
within the network, which results in a higher chance of thermal cross-talk
between the nanotubes to generate greater nonselective defunctionalization.
We also note that laser annealing of f-SWCNTs can occur at much higher
power densities for denser films. However, not being a resonant excitation,
defunctionalization of the relatively more transparent f-SWCNT structures
is much less efficient compared to inner tube resonant annealing in
Tube^2 thin films. We note that the high power density (∼50
mW/μm2) is less desirable for practical, large-scale
applications. However, significant reduction of the power density
is possible by using DWCNT precursors with tighter structure distribution
as separation techniques advance15 and
light sources that are in resonant with the larger inner tube populations
of interest. Since the annealing is an optically resonant process,
irradiation at a laser wavelength closer to resonant chiral nanostructure’s
maximum absorption cross section would result in a lower power density
threshold, as indicated also in previous works on thermal destruction
of CNTs.34

This resonant laser-induced
defunctionalization phenomenon provides
us with direct-write capability to pattern CNT structures. As a demonstration,
we used a 532 nm laser with a power density that exceeded the power
threshold (∼50 mW/μm2) to “write” a 2 × 2 array of 2.5 μm diameter
dots separated by 5 μm on a Tube^2 thin film (Figure 4). The pattern was subsequently
“read” in situ in
0.5 μm steps over a 10 μm × 10 μm area using
micro-Raman mapping with the same laser at a lower power density (0.5
mW/μm2) to avoid further defunctionalization as the
spectra were measured. Removal of the functional groups from the outer
tubes was unambiguously confirmed by the recovery of the RBMouter and G peaks as well as the diminished D peak. The sharp contrast
between the patterned dot array and the unpatterned areas on the Raman
maps demonstrates the strong localization effects of resonant laser-induced
defunctionalization of Tube^2 structures within a thin film.

Figure 4 In
situ Raman mapping confirmed the fabrication
of a 2 × 2 dot array on a thin film of Tube^2 by direct laser
patterning. The array was written using a 532 nm
laser at a power density of 50 mW/μm2. Next, the
Raman spectra were read using the same 532 nm laser
at 0.5 mW/μm2, which was lower than the threshold
power density required for annealing/writing. The Raman maps unambiguously
confirm the recovery of the DWCNT characteristics, as evidenced by
the recovery of the RBMouter and the diminishing D peaks
at the patterned dots.

We further explored this lithography technique using two
different
laser excitations: 532 and 633 nm. Using either the 532 or 633 nm
laser, we wrote dot arrays on the Tube^2 films and
then read both sets of patterns using 532 and 633
nm excitation lines at a lower power density (Figure 5). The result in Figure 5 demonstrates that only the Tube^2 structures
with inner tubes that were in resonance with the laser were selectively
defunctionalized (indicated by arrow pointing to recovered RBMouter), further corroborating that annealing occurs as a result
of optical excitation of the inner tube. Additionally, after writing the Tube^2 thin film using the 532 nm laser, recovery
of the outer tube RBM was confirmed by subsequently reading the pattern using the same 532 nm laser at a lower power density,
and consistently, the pattern could not be observed when read with the 633 nm laser, which is beyond the resonant window. Similarly,
when the 633 nm laser was used for writing the Tube^2
sample, the recovered outer tube RBM only emerged when read by the same laser line.

Figure 5 Optical patterning is specific to the electronic
structure of inner
tube. The Tube^2 thin film was written with one laser
and subsequently read at a lower power density using
Raman spectroscopy. Two laser lines, 532 and 633 nm, were used for
the writing (at a power density above the threshold)
and reading (at a power density below the threshold),
resulting in four spectral combinations. The Raman spectra, before
(dashed lines) and after (solid lines) laser annealing, are shown
for comparison. The RBMouter peaks that are restored upon
annealing are highlighted by red and blue arrows.

To demonstrate the potential application of this nanostructure
lithography technique, we optically patterned conductive channels
between Au electrodes with a channel length of 15 μm to create
circuit arrays by direct-writing on insulating Tube^2 thin films using
two lasers with wavelengths of 532 and 561 nm. This is made possible
through resonant excitation-induced defunctionalization and contact-protected
refunctionalization (Figure 6a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of these a-DWCNT circuits also revealed distinctly different conductance
between the written and nonwritten areas of the thin
film (Figure 6b,c).
Successful creation of the line patterns was also evidenced by concomitant
decrease in the D/G ratio and increase in the RBMouter peaks
of the patterned areas (Figure 6d), which was also observed from the dot arrays. Areas that
had been exposed to the laser (i.e., a-DWCNT) showed brighter contrast, indicative of higher conductivity
than the non-exposed regions (i.e., Tube^2), which
is consistent with the recovery of the extended π-conjugated
structure.

Transport characterization (VSD = −0.1
V) of a Tube^2 film (black) and a-Tube^2 circuits

We further demonstrate that this
lithography technique can be extended
to more sophisticated patterns and larger scale using a photomask
to pattern circuits of Tube^2 (Figure S7). The circuit arrays are 100 μm wide with a 50 μm pitch
perpendicular to the Au electrodes and created in a facile and rapid
fashion that mimics the resolution of photolithography patterned features
without the use of a photoresist. The nanotubes in the masked areas
of the Tube^2 film retain their functional groups and insulating properties,
while the exposed areas become defunctionalized and conductive as
evidenced by the contrast within SEM images between the interface
of covered and exposed areas.

Conductance measurements show
that the film was originally insulating
with a conductivity 0.4 μS (Figure 6e, black open circles), which was attributed
to the functional groups of the outer tube preventing the intertube
contact needed for a conductive percolating pathway. Upon laser exposure,
the Tube^2 structures within the patterned line were defunctionalized,
allowing intertube contact between neighboring nanostructures. In
this manner, we fabricated a 17 μm wide conductive pathway by
laser writing. These patterned channels possessed a conductance of
87 μS, which is over a 200-fold improvement in conductivity
(Figure 6e, red filled
circles). The conductance of the patterned channel increases linearly
with the channel width (Figure 6f). We note that the conductance restored is only 5% of the
starting, nonfunctionalized DWCNT film (Figure S8), further supporting optically selective defunctionalization.

To further demonstrate the inner tube selectivity of this resonance-enhanced
annealing and extend the applicability of this patterning technique
to semiconducting features, we refunctionalize the patterned Tube^2
thin film with the same outer wall selective chemistry. This refunctionalization
selectively functionalizes the outer tubes of the laser annealed DWCNT
structures to reproduce Tube^2 (labeled as “a-Tube^2” for the fact of the optical de-functionalization
step) but does not functionalize the junction areas where the neighboring
tubes are in strong van der Waals contact preventing functionalization
of the contact (Figure 6a). As a result, refunctionalization once again removes the optical
and electrical contributions of the outer tube but preserves the electrical
intertube contact that was established by laser annealing as shown
in our previous works.17,21,35 By removing the electronic contributions of the outer wall through
refunctionalization, the desired inner tube properties, which can
be selected by laser wavelength excitation, dominate the overall electrical
transport. Using a 532 nm laser, with the ability to selectively excite
metallic inner tubes and a 561 nm laser that is resonant with semiconducting
inner tube populations, we show that semiconducting and metallic lines
can be drawn, respectively (Figure 6g). ISD–Vg curves determined that predominantly metallic
inner tube features (ION/IOFF = 5) were created with the 532 nm laser, while p-type
semiconducting inner tube (ION/IOFF = 50) features were created upon annealing
with the 561 nm laser, which demonstrate that by proper selection
of laser excitation energies electronic-type specificity can be achieved.
While high ON/OFF ratios are needed for logic circuits, the ON/OFF
ratios obtained through the technique proposed here are sufficient
for many CNT-based semiconductor devices, such as thin film field-effect
transistor sensors, which have demonstrated picomolar sensitivity
of DNA sequences with ON/OFF ratios lower than those shown here.36 We anticipate based on the inner tube optical
transitions23 that the semiconducting selectivity
can be further improved by using a laser with greater resonance to
semiconducting populations, although such a laser was currently not
accessible to us. Furthermore, because the outer tube can be covalently
functionalized to such a high degree that a semiconducting inner tube
can be chemically gated solely by surface functional groups without
the need of a physical gating electrode,37 transistor sensors in previously unattainable device architectures
may be created in a straightforward fashion using this laser lithography
method.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that Tube^2, a synthetically
created tube-in-a-tube
nanostructure, can be used to scalably pattern electronic features
using a laser tuned to the resonance of the inner tube to selectively
remove surface functional groups from the associated outer tube. This
phenomenon is characteristic of Tube^2 structures and does not occur
for their SWCNT counterparts under the same irradiation conditions.
Power dependence experiments reveal a sharp power threshold, below
which defunctionalization does not occur. The selective defunctionalization
is attributed to laser-induced local heating of the inner tube, as
evidenced by resonant Raman spectroscopy. This inner tube selectivity
opens the opportunity to selectively defunctionalize the outer tube
of Tube^2 based on the optical properties of the inner tube. We demonstrate
that both semiconducting channels and electrically conductive pathways
can be directly patterned on an insulating thin film made of Tube^2
materials by laser writing.

Methods
Preparation
of DWCNT Solution
High-purity DWCNTs were
separated from a chemical vapor deposition grown sample (Unidym DW411UA)
using density gradient ultracentrifugation, as previously reported.23 The sorted DWCNTs have an average diameter of
0.86 and 1.61 nm for the inner and outer tubes, respectively. One
milliliter of the DWCNT solution was dialyzed (Spectra/Por Float-A-Lyzer
G2 100 kDaA) against 500 mL of 1 wt % SDS/water solution (freshly
changed at 2, 12, and 24 h) for a total of 48 h. The DWCNT solution
was then diluted with and suspended in 1 wt % SDS/water to a final
concentration at which the optical absorbance (o.d.) was 0.2 at 1000
nm.

Diazonium Salt Preparation and Synthesis of Tube^2 Solutions
4-Nitrobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate was synthesized and functionalized
to the exclusion of the inner tube, as we previously reported.20 The salts were stored at 4 °C and used
within a week after synthesis. Exposure to light was limited by covering
the vial with aluminum foil. Afterward, solutions were diluted to
a tube density of 1 mg/L.

Creation of Insulating Tube^2 Film
Thin films were
prepared using a vacuum filtration setup in which 1.5 mL of the diluted
Tube^2 solution was created using a 47 mm Whatman Anodisc aluminum
oxide membrane to filter out surfactants and unreacted reagents. Following
filtration, 500 mL of nanopure water was added to remove the residual
surfactant. We then carefully loaded the Tube^2 thin film/AAO membrane
in a Petri dish containing 40 mL of 3 M sodium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich)
solution. The thin film was left in the sodium hydroxide solution
for 15 min to dissolve the membrane, leaving the Tube^2 thin film
floating in solution. The film was delicately transferred to nanopure
water four times to rinse the surface and afterward picked up with
a clean substrate. The film was then dried on the substrate overnight
at room temperature in vacuum. The film thickness could be tuned by
controlling concentration and volume of the Tube^2 solution.

Device
Fabrication
A 10 nm chromium adhesion layer
and 50 nm gold were deposited through electron beam deposition on
a Tube^2 thin film transferred on an n-type silicon substrate with
a 300 nm silicon oxide dielectric layer (Silicon Quest International).
Photolithography was then used to pattern electrodes on the Tube^2
thin film, which was 100 μm long and 1500 μm wide, separated
by 15 μm to define the channel length.

Laser Writing on Tube^2
Films
Arrays of dots and lines
were directly written on Tube^2 films using a laser. The exposure
time for each dot was 50 s. To extend from discrete spots to lines,
the laser was drawn with a step resolution equal to half of the laser
spot size. The laser power was tuned by changing the percentage of
the power output using optical filters.

Larger scale arrays
of conductive pathways were patterned on Tube^2 thin films using a
4 in. chrome photomask on glass (Front Range Photo Mask LLC) and a
561 nm Cobalt Jive laser. The photomask was clamped to the substrate
after aligning it to circular alignment markers at the sides of the
electrodes. The conductive pathways, with a channel length of 15 μm,
were written across the electrode arrays to form circuits.

Characterization
Raman spectra and maps were collected
on an Aramis model LabRAM Raman microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using
the available excitation lines, 633 and 532 nm. The output of the
633 and 532 nm lasers were 10 and 100 mW, respectively. The conditions
for measuring (i.e., reading) the
Raman spectra included 1 s exposure time, 600 lines/mm grating, and
400 nm slit width. Absorption spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer
Lambda 1050 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer equipped with
a photomultiplier tube (σ = 2.03% over 48 h of continuous use)
and a broad-band InGaAs detector (σ = 1.56% over 48 h of continuous
use). The instrument was warmed up for 15 min prior to each use. Electrical
measurements were performed using a Keithley 4200-SCS analyzer. For
gated measurements, the devices were back-gated using the silicon
substrate.
