The
conventional strategy of synthetic colloidal chemistry for
bright and stable quantum dots has been the production of epitaxially
matched core/shell heterostructures to mitigate the presence of deep
trap states. This mindset has been shown to be incompatible with lead
halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) due to their dynamic surface
and low melting point. Nevertheless, enhancements to their chemical
stability are still in great demand for the deployment of LHP NCs
in light-emitting devices. Rather than contend with their attributes,
we propose a method in which we can utilize their dynamic, ionic lattice
and uniquely defect-tolerant band structure to prepare non-epitaxial
salt-shelled heterostructures that are able to stabilize these materials
against their environment, while maintaining their excellent optical
properties and increasing scattering to improve out-coupling efficiency.
To do so, anchored LHP NCs are first synthesized through the heterogeneous
nucleation of LHPs onto the surface of microcrystalline carriers,
such as alkali halides. This first step stabilizes the LHP NCs against
further merging, and this allows them to be coated with an additional
inorganic shell through the surface-mediated reaction of amphiphilic
Na and Br precursors in apolar media. These inorganically shelled
NC@carrier composites offer significantly improved chemical stability
toward polar organic solvents, such as γ-butyrolactone, acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, and trimethylamine, demonstrate high
thermal stability with photoluminescence intensity reversibly dropping
by no more than 40% at temperatures up to 120 °C, and improve
compatibility with various UV-curable resins. This mindset for LHP
NCs creates opportunities for their successful integration into next-generation
light-emitting devices.

Colloidal
lead halide perovskite
nanocrystals (LHP NCs) have recently emerged as a novel class of luminescent
materials with outstanding optical properties, such as high photoluminescence
quantum yields (PL QY = 50–90%),1−5 pure PL colors tunable across the entire visible range,1 PL lifetimes varying from a few to a few hundreds
of nanoseconds depending on composition and morphology,6 suppressed blinking,7 optical properties that are tolerant to intrinsic defects,8 superfluorescence from superlattices,9 and an unusual electronic fine structure as evidenced
from single-dot studies.10,11 Following the first
reports on ligand-capped colloidal formamidinum LHPs (FAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I)12−15 and the fully inorganic CsPbX3 NCs,1 considerable attention has been devoted to various aspects
of their chemistry: post-synthetic anion exchange,16−18 shape-engineering,6,19−23 self-assembly,9,24 synthesis exploration,6,25−28 and the search for alternative perovskite-like compositions.29−39

From a practical viewpoint, the most anticipated near-term
application
of LHP NCs is as green phosphors in backlit films for LCD displays.
In this regard, and somewhat contrary to general belief, LHP NCs are
RoHS-compliant, unlike CdSe-based QDs, because their strong optical
absorption allows the lead concentration in the emitting layer to
be kept well below 1000 ppm, which is the allowed concentration for
any separable part of lead-containing devices. This RoHS regulation
is independent of the encapsulation strategy and any potential leakage.40,41 At the same time, green-emitting LHP NCs offer superior optical
properties compared to the currently commercialized benchmark InP-based
QDs with PL QYs of about 85–90% (against 60% for InP) and narrow
emission line widths of 20 nm (compared to 40 nm for InP).41 Furthermore, some estimates indicate that the
superior absorption of blue light by LHP NCs over InP QDs may be sufficient
to replace color filters (which can absorb up to 2/3 of emitted light
in LCDs) with pixellated arrays of NCs.40,42−44 This can be a step forward toward more energy-efficient QD LCDs.45

In this perspective, strong efforts have
been dedicated toward
improving the stability of colloidal LHP NCs.46−73 Still, colloidal LHP NCs struggle from several stability issues
that hamper their deployment in applications such as LCD displays.47,74,75 First of all, ionic LHPs are
moderately to highly soluble in polar solvents, which limits the processing
after colloidal synthesis. Second, the highly dynamic binding of native
ligands allows access of any damaging species to the surface of NCs.28 Third, the relatively low melting point of LHPs
assists the sintering of NCs when they are in close proximity. All
of these instabilities promote NC ripening, the rapid and uncontrolled
evolution of morphology and size as well as coalescence and sintering,
which can be accelerated by oxygen, moisture, and light.74 This hampers the post-synthetic processing of
LHP NCs, especially in the presence of polar molecules and at elevated
temperatures. Most of these issues can be overcome by properly isolating
individual NCs from each other and from their environment. There are
several common ways to accomplish this: embedding colloidal LHP NCs
in a polymer film,50,52,53 in glasses,55,56,58 in lipid micelles,54 or in Pb-containing
salts,53,60,71,76,77 coprecipitation of
colloidal LHP NCs with salts,59,78 modifying their surface,65−70,79−81 or capping
the NCs with a shell.47,51,62−64,73 These approaches are
well-established for conventional and structurally more rigid semiconductor
NCs, typically made of II–VI, III–V, and IV–VI
compounds. However, most of these known protocols require the treatment
of NCs with polar solvents or molecules which, in the case of LHPs,
accelerate the ripening of NCs.12,51 Recently, we and several
other groups have proposed a synthetic approach which overcomes this
problem by isolating NCs from each other already during the nucleation
step.8,82−85 Specifically, LHP NCs were synthesized
inside a chemically robust mesoporous matrix that prevented NCs from
ripening and retarded the dissolution of LHPs in the presence of polar
moieties.

These previous works have revealed several specific
attributes
of LHP NCs that suggest re-evaluating their engineering. First, as
a result of their defect-tolerance, LHP NCs do not require passivation
for bright PL as they are rather insensitive to dangling bonds. In
addition to this, their highly dynamic lattice allows their surface
to rearrange to adhere to a variety of materials: SiO2,
Al2O3, TiO2, Cs4PbBr6, etc.8,76,83,85 Finally, LHP NCs are the only
currently known semiconductor material to exhibit bright emission
with PL QY approaching unity in the weak-confinement regime. This
allows them to be synthesized with high polydispersity and large sizes,
while still retaining exceptionally narrow emission line widths down
to 18 nm.72

Additionally, these findings
suggest that there is no need to stick
to the concept of thin, epitaxial shelling of individual QDs when
using LHP NCs. In contrast to conventional QDs, where the complete
and uniform epitaxial shelling of well-isolated colloidal particles
is required, LHP NCs can retain their excellent optical properties
even when directly embedded into non-epitaxial micrometer-scale composites
or templates.8,82−84 The use of
such micron-sized composites allows us to address a critical issue
in QD-based backlit films for LCDs – poor light out-coupling
efficiency.86 This issue is related to
the wave-guiding of light within the emissive layer, which has two
primary loss mechanisms. First, it reduces the fraction of light emitted
from the frontal plane of the device toward the liquid crystal layer.
Second, the wave-guiding increases the effective optical path and
thereby increases the likelihood of reabsorption by other QDs. These
losses can be particularly high in QD-based down-converting layers
as a result of their generally small Stokes shifts, leading to increased
overlaps between absorption and emission bands.87 A common strategy toward reducing these losses involves
the incorporation of highly scattering microparticles (e.g., SiO2, ZnO, BaSO4, ZrO2) into the down-converting layer to improve the light out-coupling
efficiency.88,89

Herein we propose a facile,
non-colloidal synthetic route that
accomplishes both aforementioned goals – creating bright LHP
emitters along with photonic engineering for light-outcoupling. Specifically,
luminescent APbX3 NCs (A = Cs or FA; X = Cl, Br, I) were
heterogeneously nucleated onto the surface of inorganic microcrystalline
carriers (nanocrystals on carriers; NCCs). We show that the anchoring
of LHP NCs significantly stabilizes them against merging and allows
them to be shelled with transparent and chemically robust NaBr salt
matrices. The final shelled NCC/NaBr exhibit improved stability against
a vast variety of solvents and can be used in processes that are otherwise
inaccessible or very harmful for colloidal LHP NCs, such as encapsulation
into industrially important acrylate-based polymers including silicone
urethane acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and poly(vinyl acetate).90,91 Furthermore, the presence of highly scattering, polydisperse microcrystals
with sizes in the range of 0.1–1 μm hinders wave-guiding
and improves the efficiency of light out-coupling, making these composite
materials well-suited for use in LCD displays.88,89

Results and Discussion
The synthesis begins with the concomitant
crystallization of an
inorganic salt, hereafter called a carrier, and LHP NCs from a single
solution in a polar solvent. Crystallization can be induced either
by evaporating the solvent or by the addition of a suitable antisolvent.
The concentrations and solvents are chosen in such a way that the
carrier microcrystals start to precipitate first and enable the heterogeneous
nucleation of LHP NCs, which is followed by their growth (Scheme 1). Through this process,
the LHP NCs are anchored to the surface of the carrier (NCC) and are
thereby stabilized against merging. This also allows for further processing
in the presence of polar molecules. In the next step, a shell of an
alkali halide or another inorganic salt can be grown onto these composite
materials, thus completing the encapsulation of the LHP NCs (Scheme 1). The proposed approach
has been tested for the encapsulation of Cs- and FA-based LHP NCs
into NaX, KX, RbX, Cs4PbX6, (CsxRb1–x)4PbX6, MgX2, CaX2, SrX2, BaX2, and ZnX2 matrices where X = Cl, Br,
I or their mixtures. We selected these carriers due to their transparency
to visible light and their suitable solubility in polar aprotic organic
solvents, which is typically a few times lower than the solubility
of LHPs. Some of these carriers (MgBr2, CaBr2, ZnBr2) were too hygroscopic and therefore led to LHP
NCs with poor stability. From all the other carriers, each carrier-LHP
pair required the molar ratio to be adjusted due to the difference
in carriers’ solubilities, as discussed below.

Scheme 1 Encapsulation
of LHP NCs into Inorganic Microcrystals
In the first step (Ia–c),
LHP NCs heterogeneously nucleate and grow on the surface of the microcrystalline
carriers (NaX, KX, RbX, Cs4PbX6, (CsxRb1–x)4PbX6, MgX2, CaX2, SrX2, BaX2, and ZnX2 where X = Cl, Br, I or their
mixtures.) In Ic, the crossed-arrows indicate that inter-NC merging
is strongly diminished. The obtained NCCs are then shelled with NaBr
in the second step of the synthesis through the direct reaction of
amphiphilic Na and Br precursors in an apolar solvent (IIa,b). The
entire process yields the final, shelled polycrystalline NCC/NaBr
particles.

To prepare these materials, solutions
of an alkali-halide (NaBr,
KBr, or RbBr), CsBr or FABr, and PbBr2 in dimethyl sulfoxide
with a small addition of N-methylformamide are correspondingly
mixed in a desired molar ratio (see SI and Table S1 for details). This mixture was then drop-cast onto a glass
substrate and typically dried at 70 °C with 25–50% relative
humidity (RH) for 3 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature.
The synthesis produces a homogeneous, microcrystalline powder with
morphologies and optical properties that are very different from either
of the precursors (Figures 1a and S1).

Confocal and optical microscopy shows roughly faceted
microcrystals
that often exhibit a tetrahedral habit, which is typical for alkali
halides (Figure 1b,c).
These microcrystals are only slightly colored but yield bright green
luminescence under UV-excitation. This combination of crystal faceting
and bright emission implies that the emission centers are mainly localized
on the surface of the microcrystals and that they are not, or at least
not always, embedded inside. Confocal microscopy confirms that LHP
NCs are primarily localized on the surface of microcrystals (Figure S2). The high polydispersity is favorable
for these microcrystals, as it can significantly improve the total
scattering within the system, resulting in improved out-coupling efficiencies
if introduced as down-converting layers in LCDs.

Scanning transmission
electron microscopy in secondary electron
(SE) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF-STEM) modes confirm
the presence of heavy-atom nanocrystalline inclusions on or near the
surface of the microcrystals (Figures 1d–f and S3). We note
that electron microscopy of the interior of microcrystals is not feasible
due to their large thickness. Furthermore, electron microscopy of
such composite materials is generally difficult due to the high volatility
of metal halides under an electron beam.92 However, STEM qualitatively shows the high concentration of LHP
NCs and their small size (ca. 5–10 nm), which
is in agreement with a PL peak position of 510 nm for this sample
(RbBr:CsPbBr3 10:1) and corresponds to that of colloidal
8–10 nm NCs.1,43 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
shows the presence of Cs, Rb, Pb, and Br, which together with the
HAADF-STEM images imply that the carrier consists of alkali bromide,
whereas bright NCs are Pb-based (Figure S3). Furthermore, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the presence
of a crystalline carrier (alkali halides or Cs4PbBr6) as the dominant phase (Figure S4). However, XRD measured on a conventional powder diffractometer
is not able to reveal the presence of CsPbBr3 NCs due to
the significant, size-related broadening of relevant reflections and
the small amount of LHP compared to the carrier. XRD measured at a
synchrotron light source (SLS XRD) reveals the broad modulation of
the background that coincides with CsPbBr3 (Figure S5, see SI for
details). This modulation indicates that CsPbBr3 is present
in the form of NCs with sizes roughly estimated to be below 10 nm,
similar to the NCs seen in the STEM images.

The variation of
the carrier:LHP ratio is the main tool for controlling
this synthetic process. An increasing ratio changes the area available
for the heterogeneous nucleation of LHP NCs and therefore the number
of nuclei. This allowed us to tune the average size of LHP NCs, which
can be roughly determined from the PL spectra for medium to small
LHP NCs by using a sizing curve reported earlier for colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs (Figures 2a and S6).43 At high LHP loading (KBr:CsPbBr3 ratios <20:1), the
PL maximum is located at around 520 nm, indicating the presence of
large LHP NCs (>20 nm). However, the number of available sites
for
heterogeneous nucleation is limited, and an additional impurity of
orange, non-luminescent microcrystals of CsPbBr3 can also
be observed (Figure S7). At slightly lower
LHP loading (KBr:CsPbBr3 molar ratio from 20:1 to 50:1),
this impurity disappears, yet the PL peak position remains nearly
unchanged in the range of 515–520 nm (corresponds to ∼14–20
nm large NCs). Even lower LHP loading (KBr:CsPbBr3 ratio
above 50:1) leads to an insufficient amount of precursors. In this
case, the diffusion-limited growth of CsPbBr3 NCs results
in a decrease of the average size and a blueshift of the PL maximum
to 495 nm, which corresponds roughly to 7 nm large NCs (Figures 2a and S6). For various carriers, the PL starts to blueshift at slightly
different LHP:carrier ratios (Figure S6). At very low LHP loading (KBr:CsPbBr3 ratios from 100:1
to 1000:1), the PL further shifts to 480 nm (∼5 nm NCs), and
a fraction of pure KBr microcrystals with perfect tetrahedral habits
and without PL can be observed (Figure S8).

correspond to different regimes: orange, coexistence of LHP NCs and

optimal range, where LHPs are mainly present in the form of large
NCs (weak confinement regime or without quantum confinement); and
blue, LHP NCs are small and exhibit medium or strong quantum confinement.

KBr:CsPbBr3 ratios; the pumping intensity 10 nJ/cm2. (d) A photograph depicting various NCCs dispersed in a variety
of containers such as plastic balls, glass dishes, and capillaries
to demonstrate the visual tunability of their emission color through
the size and composition of LHP NCs.

Despite the lack of ligands or other additives that traditionally
control the nucleation and growth of NCs, these NCs still exhibit
relatively narrow PL in the weak confinement regime (PL peak position
at >515 nm corresponding to NCs with sizes above 14 nm). A typical
PL full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) for green-emitting powders is
about 20–22 nm for CsPbBr3 and 25–27 nm for
FAPbBr3. This is comparable to the fwhm of colloidal1,12 and templated8 LHP NCs and much narrower
than that of state-of-the-art green Cd-free NC emitters.93,94 We note that such narrow emission is one of the key factors required
for color pure Rec.2020 standards for next-generation displays.95

As mentioned above, the dilution of CsPbBr3 NCs down
to a carrier:LHP molar ratio of 50:1 does not change the wavelength
of the PL maximum. However, this dilution significantly improves the
PL QY of unshelled NCCs (Figure 2b). In the case of a high LHP loading (KBr:CsPbBr3 ratio below 10:1), the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs
on KBr carriers competes with the growth of bulk CsPbBr3 in the form of microcrystals (Figure S7). These CsPbBr3 microcrystals are not luminescent, and
they absorb light from the excitation source and decrease the overall
PL QY of the material. Increasing the KBr:CsPbBr3 molar
ratio decreases the average size of CsPbBr3 NCs and minimizes
the amount of bulk CsPbBr3 microcrystals. At a KBr:CsPbBr3 molar ratio of 30:1, such microcrystals were no longer observed
in optical microscopy, and the measured PL QY was about 55 ±
15%. A further increase in the carrier:LHP ratio leads to the dilution
of CsPbBr3 NCs and further increased the PL QY of the unshelled
NCCs to 68 ± 24%. The optimal concentration, however, depends
on the LHP composition and its carrier. The optimal carriers for CsPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 were KBr and NaBr, respectively. Other
carriers produce LHP@carrier composites with ∼10 times lower
brightness. The brightest CsPbBr3@KBr NCCs were obtained
at a KBr:CsPbBr3 ratio of 40:1; whereas for the FAPbBr3@NaBr system, the optimal ratio was 20:1. The best samples
exhibit PL QY as high as 89% for CsPbBr3 and 83% for FAPbBr3.

Within the range where the PL QY varies slightly (40:1
to 100:1
carrier:LHP ratio), the PL shifts from 520 to 495 nm and the PL decay
becomes 3.5× faster. This trend is in agreement with the PL lifetime
dependence on NC size that has been reported earlier for colloidal
CsPbBr3 NCs: smaller NCs have faster radiative relaxation
rates at room temperature than larger ones.96 At the same time, we found the PL decay rate to be nearly independent
of the carrier if NCs of a similar size are compared (Figure S9).

Although all of the studied
alkali-halides behave similarly as
carriers, CsX cannot be easily compared to the others due to the presence
of intermediate compounds in the CsX-PbX2 system. Instead,
these intermediate compounds can themselves be used as carriers. This
extends the concept of concomitant iso-anionic crystallization of
LHP NCs and carriers to a fully iso-atomic system, where CsPbX3 NCs are grown on Cs4PbX6-based carriers.
The pseudobinary CsBr-PbBr2 system contains three compounds:
CsPbBr3, CsPb2Br5, and Cs4PbBr6.97 The last two melt
incongruently, indicating that the formation of CsPbBr3 and binary parent compounds is more energetically favorable (Figure S10). The formation of CsPbBr3 NCs on the surface of Cs4PbBr6 can, however,
be favored by the fact that these two phases have very similar atomic
positions and symmetry along several planes.76 The optical properties of the resulting CsPbX3@Cs4PbX6 powders are similar to those synthesized on
alkali halide carriers. By adjusting the anion composition in CsPbX3@Cs4PbX6 NCCs, the emission wavelength
can be tuned between 400 nm (corresponding to CsPbCl3)
and 700 nm (corresponding to CsPbI3), as shown in Figure S11. Only partial anion exchange was possible
as compositions with ∼15–50% of heavier anion show two
PL bands indicating phase separation, analogous to previous reports
for the bulk CsPbBr3-CsPbI3 system. For alkali-based
matrices, the range where solid solutions were unstable was generally
broader, and only ∼20% of the heavier halide could be exchanged
with a lighter one for both the Br/Cl and I/Br systems. Despite the
appealing optical properties of CsPbX3@Cs4PbX6 NCCs, we did not consider them for further investigation
because the Cs4PbX6 carrier significantly increases
the overall Pb content of the composite material. Instead, only NCCs
grown on Pb-free carriers have been shelled with salt matrixes.

While anchoring LHP NCs to the carrier surface minimizes the probability
of NC merging, it does not protect NCs from their environment. In
order to fully encapsulate NCs into salt matrices, we grew an additional
alkali halide shell on the NCC microcrystals. To do so, we developed
a polar-solvent-free shelling technique based on the reaction of amphiphilic
Na+ and Br– salts, namely sodium docusate
(AOT) and didodecylammonium bromide (DDAB) in toluene. Both salts
are highly soluble and slowly react in toluene, leading to the precipitation
of NaBr over the course of 12 h. The introduction of Na, K, or Rb-based
NCCs into this system results in the heterogeneous nucleation and
growth of NaBr around the NCC, resulting in the final NCC/NaBr (Scheme 1). These shelled
microcrystals can be obtained in the form of fairly stable dispersions
(Figure 3a) or powders
if all surfactants are washed away (Figure 3b). The shelled NCC/NaBr exhibit a random
non-uniform spatial distribution of emission centers inside the microcrystal
(Figure 3c). This is
in stark contrast to the unshelled NCCs, where LHP NCs are localized
primarily on the surface (Figure 1b,e,f). This fact, together with the clearly polycrystalline
nature of the shelled microcrystals, indicates that the NaBr grows
heterogeneously on the surface of NCCs but not separately.

Figure 3 Shelled CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr microcrystals: (a) suspension

(d) Comparison of PL spectrum of initial CsPbBr3@KBr NCC
(blue curve) and shelled NCC/NaBr (green curve). (e) Time-resolved
PL of CsPbBr3@KBr NCC and shelled CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr
in comparison with colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs.

The dissolution and merging of LHP NCs could have potentially
been
the main issues encountered upon treating NCs with polar DDAB and
AOT species, and this was indeed the case when colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs were subjected to an analogous shelling procedure. In
contrast, the anchored NCCs remain stable and similarly bright after
shelling. The PL peak position remains nearly unchanged (Figure 3d), and the PL fwhm
slightly narrows. This may be primarily due to the growth of any small
LHP NCs on the surface, which pushes them toward weaker quantum confinement
(Figure 3d). The overall
stability of the PL peak position and profile indicates that anchored
NCCs do not dissolve during shelling procedure. On average, the PL
QY remains unchanged or it even slightly increases (Figure 3d). Furthermore, the average
measured lifetime increases from about 25 ns for optimal CsPbBr3 NCCs to 45 ns for shelled CsPbBr3 NCC/NaBr (Figure 3e).

In order
to check if anchored LHP NCs can merge during the shelling
procedure, we investigated the PL temperature dependence of the final,
shelled NCC/NaBr samples (Figure 4). At room temperature, the PL of bulk CsPbBr3 is very weak and cannot be detected in the presence of bright NCs.
However, the PL of bulk CsPbBr3 impurities, if present,
can be well resolved at 4–15 K when it becomes much brighter
and narrower with a peak position at 539 nm (Figures S12). We have found that the PL of bulk impurities can be readily
differentiated from the PL of even very large NCs which emit at 525
nm at room temperature and are expected to be above 30 nm in size
(Figures S12 and S13).43 Our optimized CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr powder exhibits
PL at 520 nm at room temperature and therefore should contain smaller
LHP NCs. This allowed us to resolve any potential impurity of bulk
CsPbBr3 if it would have been present in the sample. Figure 4a indicates that
the PL spectrum collected at 15 K does not show a sharp line at a
wavelength of 539 nm (2.300 eV). This indicates that our anchored
LHP NCs do not merge (at least not to the point that they grow above
30 nm in size) during the shelling process.

Figure 4 (a) PL dependence on
temperature for shelled CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr. The dashed line
shows PL spectrum of bulk CsPbBr3 at 15 K. Inset shows
PL fwhm dependence on temperature for smaller
CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr (PL maximum at 520 nm at room temperature,
green symbols) and very large CsPbBr3@Cs4PbBr6 (PL maximum at 525 nm at room temperature, blue symbols).
(b) Time-resolved PL spectra of shelled CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr
microcrystals at various temperatures.

The overall PL dependence on temperature for the shelled LHPs NCs
is very similar to that of colloidal LHP NCs.7 The PL redshifts to 2.331 eV (532 nm) upon cooling to 15 K and narrows
down to 20–40 meV. This fwhm indicates that the size distribution
of CsPbBr3 NCs is roughly two times broader than the best
colloidal counterparts.96 The fast component
of the radiative decay rate accelerates from about 10 to 0.6 ns at
15 K. Those values are typical for large (15–20 nm) colloidal
LHP NCs.10,96

In addition to preserving or even
enhancing the optical properties
of LHP NCs, the fully shelled LHP NCCs/NaBr also demonstrate good
stability against many polar solvents. They withstand sonication in
pure acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, N-methylpyrrolidone,
γ-butyrolactone, tetramethylurea, and triethylamine (Figure 5). In contrast, colloidal
LHP NCs either completely dissolve or merge even in the presence of
minor quantities of polar molecules (9 vol % in toluene) and consequently
suffer a significant decrease in their PL QY. The shelled NCCs/NaBr
instead dissolve only slightly in some solvents and retain their high
PL QY. We attribute the enhanced stability to the fact that the aforementioned
solvents, while able to dissolve or degrade LHPs,98 are rather poor solvents for alkali halides. As a result,
only fully shelled LHP NCCs can survive treatments with such solvents,
whereas poorly shelled or unshelled ones dissolve. This aspect can
be used to wash out poorly shelled NCCs from the ones which are properly
shelled.

Figure 5 Stability of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs and shelled CsPbBr3@KBr/NaBr microcrystals against select polar solvents. The
decreased PL QY (a) is ascribed to the degree of merging of LHP NCs
in each case. The weight loss for materials treated with the corresponding
solvent is shown in (b). In all cases, the total amount of LHP was
kept constant at 0.1 mg. For colloidal NCs, only a small amount of
the polar solvent (9 vol %) was added to the toluene solution. For
NCC/NaBr, the powders were sonicated for 5 min in 200 μL of
the pure, polar solvent. A 100% weight loss in the case of colloidal
NCs indicates the complete dissolution of the LHP NCs treated with
NMP, GBL, TMU, and TEA.

Given that shelling protects
LHP NCCs from attack by many polar
molecules and stabilizes them against merging, one can now use these
powders in many post-synthetic processes that would otherwise diminish
the optical properties of colloidal LHP NCs. For example, one can
perform polymerization with numerous monomers or embed these microcrystals
into polymers without significant loss of PL QY (Figure 6a–c). As there are many
polymers with very low water and oxygen permeability and many of them
can be used as an encapsulant for such materials, we chose to investigate
those which could further enhance the stability of these shelled LHP
NCCs. Therefore, polystyrene, cyclic olefin copolymer TOPAS, and various
UV-curable monomers have been tested including methyl methacrylate,
lauryl methacrylate, silicon urethane acrylate (Miramer SIU2400),
bisphenol A glycerolate diacrylate, NOA 63 with or without additives
of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, vinyl
acetate, and isobornyl acrylate. In all of these cases, the PL QY
of NCC/NaBr did not drop after embedding them into a polymer encapsulant.
This is again in stark contrast to colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs
which are known to often lose their PL QY after being embedded into
polymers.12

Figure 6 Stability of NaBr-shelled
LHP NCCs. (a) Scheme of the samples used
for reliability tests: NaBr-shelled LHP NCCs are embedded into a polymer
encapsulant. The polymer encapsulant is prepared either by drying
the polymer solution (b) or by UV-curing a mixture of monomers (c).
PL intensity (d) and peak position (e) change during heating to 120
°C (closed symbols) followed by cooling to room temperature (opened
symbols) for shelled FAPbBr3 NCC/NaBr (green) and colloidal
FAPbBr3 NCs (red curve). (f) PL QY drops after 190 h in
three different tests of shelled CsPbBr3 NCC/NaBr in comparison
with colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs: (i) initial sample, (ii) NCs
embedded in acrylate film, (iii) reliability test at 95% RH and 50
°C, (iv) thermal stability test at 80 °C, and (v) thermal
stability test at 120 °C.

At elevated temperatures, all samples show decreased PL QY, which
is an intrinsic property of LHPs.99 Shelled
FAPbBr3 NCs exhibit the best thermal stability (Figure 6d,e). At 40–50
°C, which is a typical operating temperature for backlit displays,
their PL intensity only decreases by about 5%. At 120 °C, the
PL intensity decreases by 40%. However, we found that briefly heating
(∼20 min at temperatures above 100 °C) does not permanently
degrade the samples; the PL intensity fully recovers when samples
are cooled down to room temperature (Figure 6d). Similarly, the PL peak position blue
shifts by about 8 nm upon heating to 120 °C but returns to its
original position after cooling (Figure 6e). Additional heating/cooling cycles can
be repeated with complete reversibility. In contrast, colloidal NCs
embedded into polymer films do not exhibit this thermal stability
and instead quickly merge (Figures 6d,e).

In order to verify the long-term stability
of NCC/NaBr microcrystals,
we embedded them into polymer films and performed three reliability
tests: (i) at 80 °C, (ii) at 120 °C, and (iii) at high humidity
and elevated temperature (95% RH, 50 °C). These tests were performed
in notably harsher conditions than required for real display applications.
This allowed us to probe the material degradation in an accelerated
regime. After 190 h under such harsh conditions, the shelled CsPbBr3 NCC/NaBr samples showed notably higher stability compared
to colloidal NCs (Figure 6f): about 65% of the initial PL QY remained after 190 h at
80 °C, and the PL QY drop during the humidity test was negligible
(although the overall brightness dropped a bit, probably due to partial
diffusion of water inside the polymer.) To the best of our knowledge,
this is the best stability reported so far for LHP NCs, and it is
enabled by the combination of a robust inorganic matrix with a polymer
encapsulant.

Conclusions
In summary, we propose
a two-step approach to the synthesis of
LHP NCs embedded into robust Pb-free microcrystalline, inorganic salt
matrices. The key point of this approach is the initial concomitant
crystallization of LHP NCs and salt carriers. By anchoring LHP NCs
to the carrier, they are stabilized against merging and can be coated
with an optically transparent inorganic shell. For this second step,
we developed a method that involves the direct reaction of amphiphilic
Na and Br precursors in polar-solvent-free media, resulting in the
precipitation of NaBr on the surface of salt carriers and LHP NCs.
This results in NaBr-shelled-NCCs with optical properties on par with
the best colloidal LHP NCs, including high PL QY of ∼90%, pure
PL colors with line widths as narrow as 20 nm for green LHPs, and
PL tunability through both NC size and anion composition. At the same
time, the stability of these powders toward polar moieties, such as
ethanol, acetonitrile, γ-butyrolactone, or acrylates, is significantly
improved due to the complete isolation of LHP NCs from each other
and from the environment. This permits the use of shelled LHP NCs
in processes which otherwise degrade the optical properties of colloidal
LHP NCs. Finally, the introduction of non-absorbing inorganic shells
and matrices increases their overall scattering to facilitate improved
out-coupling efficiencies for down-converting films in LCDs.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of LHP NCs on
Alkali Halide Carriers
The
relevant solutions from Table S1 were mixed
in a desired ratio, homogenized by vortex mixing, drop-casted onto
a glass substrate, and heated to 70 °C for 5 h (for Cl- and Br-based
compositions) or to 200 °C for 10 min (for I-based compositions).
For FAPbX3 NCCs (X = Br, I), an excess of FAX in respect
to PbX2 was used.

Shelling of NCs-on-Carrier (NCC) with NaBr
NCC powders
were thoroughly ground or mildly ball-milled. The obtained fine powder
(10 mg) was dispersed in 2 mL of a DDAB solution in toluene (0.5 M)
and sonicated for 5 min. The resulting dispersion was stirred, while
0.5 mL of an AOT solution in toluene (2 M) was added dropwise over
the course of an hour. The reaction mixture was kept stirring for
the next 12 h. The final dispersion was washed with toluene and ethyl
acetate, dried in vacuum, and stored inside a glovebox.

Encapsulation
of NCC and NCC/NaBr into PS or TOPAS Polymers
The desired
amount of NCC/NaBr powder was dispersed in a polymer
solution in toluene (10 wt %) and cast onto a glass substrate and
dried at 50 °C for 1 h.

Example of the Encapsulation of NCC/NaBr
into UV-Cured Polymers
The desired amount of NCC/NaBr powder
was added to a distilled
LMA:EGDMA mixture (4:1) with 0.1% of Irgacure 819. The obtained mixture
was cast onto a glass substrate and cured for 15 min under 20 mW/cm2 flux (365 nm).
