Untethered
mobile microrobots have the potential to leverage minimally
invasive theranostic functions precisely and efficiently in hard-to-reach,
confined, and delicate inner body sites. However, such a complex task
requires an integrated design and engineering, where powering, control,
environmental sensing, medical functionality, and biodegradability
need to be considered altogether. The present study reports a hydrogel-based,
magnetically powered and controlled, enzymatically degradable microswimmer,
which is responsive to the pathological markers in its microenvironment
for theranostic cargo delivery and release tasks. We design a double-helical
architecture enabling volumetric cargo loading and swimming capabilities
under rotational magnetic fields and a 3D-printed optimized 3D microswimmer
(length = 20 μm and diameter = 6 μm) using two-photon
polymerization from a magnetic precursor suspension composed from
gelatin methacryloyl and biofunctionalized superparamagnetic iron
oxide nanoparticles. At normal physiological concentrations, we show
that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme could entirely degrade
the microswimmer in 118 h to solubilized nontoxic products. The microswimmer
rapidly responds to the pathological concentrations of MMP-2 by swelling
and thereby boosting the release of the embedded cargo molecules.
In addition to delivery of the drug type of therapeutic cargo molecules
completely to the given microenvironment after full degradation, microswimmers
can also release other functional cargos. As an example demonstration,
anti-ErbB 2 antibody-tagged magnetic nanoparticles are released from
the fully degraded microswimmers for targeted labeling of SKBR3 breast
cancer cells in vitro toward a potential future scenario
of medical imaging of remaining cancer tissue sites after a microswimmer-based
therapeutic delivery operation.

==== Body
Advancements in interventional
technologies have enabled minimally invasive strategies, such as endoscopy
or robot-assisted surgery, which have markedly reduced centimeter/decimeter-size
incisions of many open surgeries to millimeter-size holes, lowered
postoperative patient morbidity, and shortened recovery times.1,2 The advances and evolution of untethered mobile robots, whose size
go down to the level of a single cell, can further leverage minimally
invasive medicine by providing a direct access and precise control
in deep and delicate body sites, such as the central nervous system,
the circulatory system, the fetus, and the eye.3−8 Recent progress along this line has already resulted in a number
of synthetic and biohybrid microrobotic designs with intriguing functionalities
toward their use in various pathophysiological environments.9−14

Active navigation of highly concentrated therapeutic and diagnostic
agents to the site of action could represent a state-of-the-art application
of microrobots, considering the limited delivery and distribution
efficiencies offered by the systemic routes and local diffusion.15 By this means, it is possible to minimize the
effects of systemic toxicity and increase the overall efficacy of
single-dose administration.16 Autonomous
release of multiple types of payloads with programmable kinetics based
on the environmental sensing of local cues, such as disease markers,
in the living milieu could enable microrobotic therapy and diagnosis
in the form of an orderly executed, programmable operation.17 A conventional robot responds to the changes
in its environment by means of its on-board sensors and computational
capabilities; however, achieving such capabilities at the smaller
dimensions, where such computational capabilities do not exist, remains
a major research question.18 In nature,
micro-organisms, such as slime molds and bacteria, have evolved to
use physical intelligence as the main route of making decisions in
complex and evolving conditions.19 Accordingly,
programmed physical and chemical properties of materials can enable
a robust design route for making microrobotic systems with the capabilities
of motion, sensing, and functioning in dynamic interaction with their
local environment.20,21

Biodegradability, that
is, decomposition over time as a result
of the resident biological activity, is a critical aspect of microrobotic
design for their safe operation in the living environment. When the
prescribed task is accomplished, the safest option for removing the
microrobots from the body is to expect their degradation to nontoxic,
metabolized products. The use of nondegradable materials can result
in serious acute and chronic toxicities, which could require surgical
revision, and hence lower the overall desired benefit from the microrobot.22 As a result, materials that predictably degrade
and disappear in a safe manner have become increasingly important
for medical applications.23 Microrobotic
systems developed so far have not tackled the issue of biodegradability,
so it complicates their clinical use due to possible adverse effects
in the body.

In the present study, we report an integrated strategy
for the
design and fabrication of a hydrogel-based, biodegradable microrobotic
swimmer, which accomplishes its tasks of therapeutic and diagnostic
release in vitro based on the environmental sensing
of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) enzyme. In the physiological
environment, MMP-2 plays an important role in the tissue remodeling
process by degrading various types of collagen that constitute the
main fabric of the extracellular matrix. In many cancers, however,
tumor cells metastasizing to other tissues use this enzyme to escape
from the surrounding matrix, so the local concentration of MMP-2 is
elevated.24,25 The local pathological concentrations of
MMP-2 trigger the microswimmer to switch on a boosted drug release
pathway by rapidly swelling its hydrogel network. We accomplish the
fabrication of magnetically powered, environmentally responsive microswimmers
by 3D printing of a nanocomposite magnetic precursor. The precursor
comprises iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in gelatin methacryloyl,
a photo-cross-linkable semisynthetic polymer derived from collagen.26 Gelatin also contains target cleavage sites
for MMP-2, thereby appealing as a biodegradable structural material
for microrobots.27 We show that upon the
enzymatic breakdown of the microswimmer network, anti-ErbB 2 antibody-tagged
magnetic contrast agents are released into the local environment for
targeted cell labeling of ErbB 2 overexpressing SKBR3 cancer cells,
thereby promising follow-up evaluation strategy of the preceding therapeutic
intervention. Altogether, the findings of the present work represent
a leap toward in vivo mobile microrobots that are
capable of sensing, responding to the local microenvironment, and
performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic tasks using their smart
composite material architectures in physiologically complex environments.

Results
and Discussion
Design and 3D Printing of Microswimmer Hydrogels
As
the swimmer size goes to microscopic scales, the viscous forces begin
to dominate over the inertial forces. As a result, a microswimmer
needs to do continuous nonreciprocal motions to break spatial and
temporal symmetries to generate a forward thrust.28 To comply with the same challenge, micro-organisms in nature
have evolved elaborate locomotion strategies, such as helical rotation
of bacterial flagella, and the beating of paramecium cilia, which
have so far inspired many synthetic swimmer designs.29−34 Inspired by a similar mechanism, the design of our microrobotic
swimmer is illustrated in Figure 1. From an empirical point of view, the geometry of
the microswimmer comprises a cylindrical core wrapped by a double
helix, and the cylinder has cones at both ends. Due to the chirality
of the double helix, the rotational motion of the microswimmer is
coupled to its translational motion. The structure of the microswimmer
primarily involves increasing the volume-to-surface ratio, with the
goal of accommodating concentrated therapeutics in its bulk. Previous
designs were limited to a simple helix, and the materials used to
make them yielded nonporous architectures. As a result, such designs
were only for the applications of cargo transport on the swimmer surface,
which put significant limitations over the amount of the deliverable
cargo and hence the potential efficacy of the microrobotic operations.32,33,35

X-ray spectroscopy mapping of iron confirming the homogeneous embedding

The dimensions of the microswimmer
were determined by four parameters: L, λ, D, and R (Figure 1A). The length, L, was fixed
to 20.0 μm, and the diameter of the inner
cylinder, R, to 3.3 μm, to have a microswimmer
on the size order of an average mammalian cell. We then sought to
maximize the swimming speed by varying the wavenumber, L/λ, and D/R in a series of
computational fluid dynamics simulations and built the equation of
motion for the microswimmer (Supporting Information Figures S1–S3; also see supporting Text S1 for a detailed
discussion). Swimming motility simulations and experiments were conducted
in water at room temperature for a quantitative proof-of-concept study.
However, as future in vivo translation needs to be
conducted in biological fluids, which are non-Newtonian and heterogeneous,
application-oriented optimizations will be proposed in future follow-up
studies. In water, rotation–translation coupling was observed
to lie in an optimum region, yielding the maximum swimming velocity
within the confines of the studied design space (Figure 1B and Supporting Information Figure S4). The coupling decreased toward the long
and short wavelengths, as, in both cases, the structure geometry lost
its chirality and converged to a cylinder and hence lost its ability
to generate forward thrust. The coupling also decreased by decreasing
the cord radius, D, of the double helix because the
interaction surface of the double helix with the surrounding fluid
went smaller. Altogether, the dimensionless ratios of L/λ = 2.5 and D/R = 0.5 were
evaluated to give the highest swimming speed given the design considerations.
Concerning the trajectory stability along a single line, a single
helix is expected to swim with lower stability at noninteger wavenumbers,
here 2.5, due to the balancing of the hydrodynamic forces throughout
the helices.36 Nevertheless, the design
in the form of double helix compensates the trajectory stability.
The lateral drift was found to be an order of magnitude higher with
the single-helix configuration than that of the double-helix configuration
(Supporting Information Figure S5). The
wobbling velocity, that is, the lateral angular velocities of the
microswimmer with single-helix configuration, was also an order of
magnitude higher with the single helix (Supporting Information Figure S6). These simulations showed that the double
helix represents an advantageous design scheme in favor of hydrodynamic
efficiency and thus power requirements.

The use of magnetic
fields is a prominent way of remote powering
and control of medical microrobots.12,37 In contrast
to other untethered power transfer alternatives, such as light and
chemical fuels, magnetic fields provide a biocompatible source of
energy and are able to safely and uniformly penetrate biological tissues.12 Catalytic microswimmers usually rely on nonbiocompatible
fuel sources for propulsion, and those that are moving with biocompatible
fuels are unable to move inside biologically relevant ionic media.38 Powering with light is limited with the penetration
depth, safely deliverable light intensity, and the line-of-sight exposure,
so it is not applicable to confined and complex in vivo environments. Using acoustic fields is a promising method for off-board
propulsion and manipulation of microswimmers. However, the functional
design of such a microswimmer and its application in a biological
setting is currently insufficient and requires future developments.12 To rotate the double helix, rotating magnetic
fields are needed, which then create a torque on the microswimmer
through a magnetic axis defined perpendicular to the helical axis.
Assuming the external field is invariant, the magnetic force scales
with the volume of the magnetic material, that is, L3, whereas the equivalent force from the magnetic torque
scaling with L2. Thus, swimming by magnetic
torque-induced rotation is preferable at smaller scales, less than
100 μm, due to its higher efficiency of thrust generation.20 We sought to embed superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles in the form of a nanocomposite to impart magnetizability
to the microswimmer body. Embedding iron oxide nanoparticles has certain
advantages over magnetic surface coating, such as with cobalt or nickel.
Cobalt and nickel are considerably toxic to the living environment,
whereas iron oxide nanoparticles are mostly regarded as biofriendly.39 Coating the microswimmer surface would also
drastically reduce the availability of the microswimmer bulk for cargo
loading and release from the porous hydrogel network. Additionally,
biofunctionalization of magnetic nanoparticles provides an opportunity
as smart contrast agents for targeted cell labeling toward medical
imaging and therapy.40 In order to create
an effective magnetic torque for rotation, introduction of a magnetization
axis perpendicular to the helical axis was necessary, which was accomplished
by the alignment and entrapment of the magnetic nanoparticles under
uniform magnetic field during the fabrication process (Figure 1C,D).41

To realize such a design with highly demanding geometrical
and
compositional aspects, we employed 3D-printing based on two-photon
polymerization or direct laser writing (Figure 1D). This fabrication technique relies on
the simultaneous absorption of two half-energy photons by the photoinitiator
at the tight focal spot of a femtosecond-pulsed infrared laser light.
As the two-photon absorption occurs only in a fraction of the focal
volume, and the polymer precursor is transparent to the infrared laser
wavelength (i.e., 780 nm), spatiotemporal control
of the two-photon absorption enables highly complex 3D computer-aided
designs with submicron features. For the printing, we prepared a nanocomposite
hydrogel precursor containing 100 mg mL–1 gelatin
methacryloyl, 30 mg mL–1 photoinitiator, and 6 mg
mL–1 iron oxide nanoparticles, which we ensured
to be compatible with two-photon polymerization (Supporting Information Figures S7 and S8). The structural
fidelity of the resulting microswimmers was in agreement with the
design, and we did not observe undesired shrinkage or swelling in
the polymerization and development steps (Figure 1E). Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis proved
homogeneous distribution of the iron oxide nanoparticles inside the
microswimmer (Figure 1F and Figure S9).

The total amount
of magnetic nanoparticles loaded in the mesh network
of the microswimmer body is critical for the magnitude of magnetization
and hence the swimming speed. Decreasing the amount will result in
lower step-out frequencies, thereby reducing the achievable translational
thrust with the design. Therefore, we aimed to maximize the volume
fraction of the magnetic nanoparticles in the precursor suspension.
Nevertheless, increased concentrations of nanoparticles from 0.1 to
10 mg mL–1 narrowed down the effective laser energy
density range for both low and high laser intensities (Figure S10). At lower laser intensities, the
aggregates of nanoparticles at higher nanoparticle concentrations
physically blocked the propagation of the polymerization because there
are fewer chains generated to complete the assigned laser trajectories,
and insufficiently linked structures lowered the structural quality.
At higher laser intensities, nanoparticle aggregates strongly interacted
with the laser light, resulting in local heating, bubble generation,
and structural damage. This problem could be potentially circumvented
with iron oxide nanoparticles that have better colloidal stability,
and hence they have lesser tendency for aggregation at higher concentrations.
In the current nanoparticle design, microscopic aggregates were evident
during polymerization above 6 mg mL–1 iron oxide
nanoparticle concentration. In this regard, this threshold concentration
was used in the rest of the microswimmer preparations, as they were
homogeneously dispersed in the solution without any particle aggregation
or agglomeration (Figure S8). Additionally,
the two-photon lithography method does not reach temperatures that
would affect the magnetic properties of the iron oxide nanoparticles.

Mobility of Microswimmers
For magnetic mobilization,
we utilized a custom six-coil electromagnetic setup to create rotating
magnetic fields that exert a computer-controlled magnetic torque on
the microswimmer’s long axis (Figures S3 and S11). We determined the step-out frequency of the microswimmers
loaded with 6 mg mL–1 iron oxide nanoparticles by
increasing input frequency at every 10 s starting from 1 to 6 Hz with
1 Hz step size at 20 mT. The swimming velocity increased linearly
with increasing excitation frequency (Figure 2A and Supporting Video S1). The microswimmers exhibited predominantly wobbling behavior
in the frequency range of 1–3 Hz. The cork-screw motion was
observed in the range of 3–5 Hz. The step-out frequency of
the microswimmers was 6 Hz. We characterized the long-distance trajectory
of the microswimmers by actuating them at 5 Hz, just below their step-out
frequency, to determine their average swimming speed (3.36 ±
0.71 μm s–1) (Figure 2B and Supporting Video S2). Temporally constant rotating fields in the work space
allow navigation of microswimmers as small teams (Supporting Video S2). Magnetic steering control of the biodegradable
microswimmers was shown with a given the task of reaching checkpoints
from A to D (Figure 2C and Supporting Video S2).

velocity of the microswimmers was found to be 3.36 ± 0.71 μm
s–1. (C) Magnetic steering control of the microswimmer.

A to D.

Biodegradability with MMP-2
Matrix metalloproteinases
operate in the extracellular environment and play an important role
in tissue remodeling by degrading various extracellular matrix components.
These enzymes could, therefore, represent an appealing target for
the proteolytic degradation of our microswimmers once they have completed
their prescribed tasks. In a healthy individual, MMP-2 is reportedly
present at various concentrations, yet typically in the range of 140–200
ng mL–1, depending on the type of tissue that is
expressed.24,25 At an unrealistically high concentration
of MMP-2 (i.e., 100 μg mL–1), we observed that the microswimmers were entirely degraded within
an hour in vitro at 37 °C (Supporting Video S3). The complete degradation time was a
function of the initial MMP-2 concentration (Figure 3A,B). At more realistic concentrations, such
as 4 μg mL–1, it took around 5 h for complete
degradation, 67 h at 0.500 μg mL–1, and 118
h at 0.125 μg mL–1, that is, the physiological
level. The degradation kinetics of microswimmers should be more closely
investigated for a target application at a specific tissue, considering
all the tissue-specific proteases and other local conditions. Very
recently, salt-based erosion of inorganic microswimmers was shown
for the route of microswimmer degradation in the living environment.42 The present study presents a microrobotic swimmer
that is completely removed by a physiologically relevant enzymatic
process, which leaves no detectable toxic residues behind (Figure 3C,D). Although we
did not observe an acute toxicity with the SKBR3 cell line, even in
the presence of high iron oxide nanoparticle concentrations, given
the potential long-term toxicity risks raised by the use of nanoparticles
should be taken into account in the line of the current literature.39 We anticipate that the degradation time could
be further extended by introducing nondegradable methacryloyl polymers,
such as poly(ethylene glycol), in the microswimmer network, so that
the density of the enzyme recognition sites would be lowered.

the rapid swell of the microswimmers followed by the collapse of the
entire network. (B) Enzymatic degradation of the microswimmers. At
the physiological level, MMP-2 degrades the microswimmers within 118
h. Enzymatic susceptibility introduces a concept of operational lifetime,
defined as the time period that microswimmer preserves its original
morphology for proper navigation. The operational lifetime is a function
of the enzyme concentration in the microenvironment. Data are presented
as mean ± standard deviation. (C) Live (green) and dead (red)

the microswimmers. (D) Quantitative analysis of the acute toxicity
induced by the degradation products of the microswimmers in comparison

untreated cells. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

A one-way shape memory response
of the microswimmers to the enzyme
emerged in the degradation process. Following the introduction of
MMP-2, we observed concentration-dependent swelling of the microswimmer
body more than 3-fold its initial volume, followed by the collapse
of the entire hydrogel network (Figure 3B). The swelling of the microswimmers indicates that
MMP-2 enzymes could diffuse into the microswimmers and started the
hydrolysis of the polymer chains uniformly across the microswimmer
body. In the swelling phase, the enlarged pores were filled by the
water molecules that diffused into the polymer network at a rate faster
than the hydrolysis of the polymer chains near the microswimmer surface.
This relationship suggests that the observed phenomenon is homogeneous
or bulk erosion.23 In bulk degradation,
water continues to diffuse until it saturates the entire network.
As the rate of water diffusion exceeds the rate of the bond cleavage
reaction, uniform swelling is observed long before the collapse of
the network.43 At this phase, the concentration
of the hydrolyzable bonds is high. As the degradation continues, the
polymer segments start dissolving inside water, and the loss of mass
becomes observable throughout the material in a homogeneous manner.
This is observable in the microscopy images of the microswimmers shown
in Figure 3A. At 4
μg mL–1 MMP-2 concentration, the double helices
of the microswimmers remain visible over the first 205 min, until
which the microswimmers already swelled about 3.5-fold by volume.
At 272 min, surface erosion becomes clearly detectable, followed by
rapid and total degradation of the microswimmers. Taking into account
the morphological change of the microswimmers, a therapeutic time
window appears for the microrobotic tasks to be carried out in a controlled
way. The operational lifetime ends before the complete degradation,
when the microswimmers start swelling (a volumetric expansion above
2% was considered as the threshold value) because the microswimmers
would then lose their ability to navigate due to significant loss
of the structural chirality. The operational lifetime of the microswimmers
in the physiological environment is around 67 h, whereas the complete
degradation time is 118 h. As a result, the task of a biodegradable
microrobot concerning its navigation and localization should be accomplished
within the operational lifetime (Figure 3B).

Boosted Drug Release
A major compositional
fraction
of hydrogels is water, typically accounting for more than 90% by mass.
Highly porous hydrogel networks can thus very effectively sequester
high amounts of therapeutic and diagnostic cargo types, which can
then be released in response to various input signals with controllable
spatial and temporal schemes.44,45 As noted previously,
overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases is associated with almost
any cancer types because degradation of the matrix promotes tumor-cell
growth, migration, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.46 For example, the concentration of MMP-2 above
200 ng mL–1 in the serum was associated with colorectal
cancer patients, whereas the quantitative amounts are largely unknown
for other cancer types.25 MMP-2 could thus
represent a valuable biomarker for the disease state of the tissue
to be sensed and acted upon by the microswimmers. In this regard,
the rapid swelling of the microswimmers as an initial response at
the elevated concentrations of MMP-2 could serve as a switch for accelerated
drug release. As a hydrogel swells, the mesh size increases, and the
entrapped drug is released. Because the mesh size is correlated with
the extent of swelling, the initial MMP-2 concentration could regulate
the overall release kinetics. To this end, we first studied the relationship
between the swelling kinetics and the initial enzyme concentration
(Figure 4A). At 0.125
μg mL–1 MMP-2 concentration, around the physiological
level, swelling response was not evident in the first 30 min. At 0.250
μg mL–1, the swelling began to occur after
20 min following the introduction of the enzyme. At 0.5 and 1 μg
mL–1, the swelling started as soon as the enzyme
was introduced. A more detailed investigation of the MMP-2-mediated
swelling showed that the microswimmers exhibit high sensitivity to
the pathological MMP-2 concentrations, whereas they retain their original
size under physiological conditions, which underpins the stimuli-responsive
autonomous behavior of the microswimmers (Figure S12a). The ionic strength of the solution and the proteinaceous
content of the environment have also varying impact on the rate of
the MMP-2-mediated swelling of the microswimmers at 37 °C (Figure S12b). A typical limitation of swelling-controlled
drug delivery with bulk hydrogels is their slow responsiveness due
to the slow influx of water into the network. However, as our microswimmer
is small, and so is the diffusion length, and highly porous, the response
was fast and robust. As a result, the volume of the microswimmers
increased by ca. 60% within the first 30 min in the presence of 1
μg mL–1 MMP-2. This volumetric expansion considerably
accelerated (more than 20%) the model drug–analogue dye release
as an initial response to high enzyme concentration (Figure 4B and Figure S13). Control over the drug release kinetics from the microswimmers
in response to pathological cues in the microenvironment is particularly
valuable for effective and proportional engagement with the disease.
Biodegradation is highly valuable in order to be able to fully utilize
the drug cargo in the hydrogel network. Without degradation, almost
the half of the payload remains inside the network and hence is a
sign of poor bioavailability. On the other hand, network degradation
increases the bioavailability of the drug payload by releasing all
of its content from the microswimmers (Figure 4B,C).

Figure 4 Enzymatically controlled drug release
from the hydrogel microswimmers.
(A) Elevated concentrations of MMP-2 cause rapid swelling of the microswimmer
body, thereby acting as a switch for accelerated drug release. Data
are presented as mean ± standard deviation. (B) At 1 μg
mL–1 MMP-2 concentration, accelerated drug release
in the first few hours (the pale pink region) is attributed to swelling-mediated
mesh size increase. At the end of 2 days, almost all the payload is
released from the degraded microswimmers, whereas half of the content
is retained in the nondegraded one, which severely reduces the bioavailability
of a significant portion of the drug to be delivered (pale green region).
Data as presented with mean ± standard deviation. (C) Epifluorescence
images of microswimmers with loaded dextran-FITC cargo used as a model
macromolecular drug equivalent. Enhanced drug bioavailability is evidenced
by the enzymatic degradation of the network, which releases its entire
content.

Targeted Cell Labeling
The enzymatic collapse of the
hydrogel network further releases the magnetic nanoparticles that
are used to provide the magnetic torque for locomotion. We envision
that targeted labeling of tumor cells with these locally released
magnetic contrast agents could later enable follow-up evaluation of
the preceding therapeutic release. For this, we modified the nanoparticle
surface to display anti-ErbB 2 antibody for targeting ErbB 2 receptors,
which is overexpressed in the breast cancer cell line SKBR3. For the
ease of analysis in vitro, the nanoparticles were
also modified with fluorophores (Figure 5A). The antibody-tagged nanoparticles were
embedded inside the microswimmers similarly to their nonmodified counterparts
(Figure 5B). The modification
of the nanoparticles does not impair the overall swimming performance
of the microswimmers. We explored the cell labeling performance of
the magnetic nanoparticles released from the microswimmers via MMP-2-mediated degradation. Following the degradation
of the microswimmers, the functional nanoparticles released into the
environment labeled 39.3% of SKBR3 cells for the detection with fluorescence-activated
cell sorting method (Figure 5C and Figure S14). On the other
hand, only 9.5% of the cell population was labeled without the surface
modification of the nanoparticles, which shows a small degree of nonspecific
interaction existed between the cell and nanoparticles, as well (Figure 5D).

fail to target SKBR3 cells (D).

The combination of therapeutic and diagnostic release capabilities
in a soft biodegradable microswimmer could enable semiautonomous and
minimally invasive microrobotic operations, where the impact of the
therapeutic intervention could be monitored by locating the remaining
target cells with the magnetic contrast agents. In a potential theranostic
application, the microswimmers could be injected to the vicinity of
a tumor (Figure 6).
From there, they could be remotely controlled through microtracks
by the external magnetic fields for precise navigation, steering,
and localization to the tumor with minimum possible damage to the
surrounding sensitive tissues. Although the mobility of the microswimmers
is externally controlled, therapeutic intervention via controlled cargo release is achieved autonomously based on the pathological
signal input at the tumor microenvironment. The present work reports
the MMP-2 enzyme that triggers boosted cargo release at pathological
concentrations, whereas physiological enzyme concentration remains
below the detection limit. The MMP-2 concentration is also able to
modulate the swelling kinetics, which ensures that there might be
adequate drug dose delivered and sustained at extended time intervals
(Figure S12a). Spatially strategic localization
of multiple microswimmers can tune the locally delivered doses of
therapeutics based on the local intensities of the pathological signals.
The significant volumetric expansion of the hydrogel matrix could
also be turned into an advantage to blockade vessels for tumor chemoembolization.
For such and other scenarios, a large team of microswimmers would
be required, and control strategies to this end are being developed.47,48 Long-distance navigation of the microswimmers across distant body
sites, that is, on the order of tens of centimeters, remains a grand
challenge, as this would require multiple tissue barriers that need
to be passed and reliable steering in the bloodstream with overwhelmingly
high flow rates. Overcoming tissue barriers requires engineering of
the swimmers with higher functional capabilities acting in concert
with the environmental signals. Our group and others are in parallel
exploring strategies to enable a higher degree of freedom for the
operations of microrobotic swimmers in complex live environments.49,50 Additionally, during any in vivo medical operation,
the microswimmers need to be monitored with medical imaging techniques,
such as magnetic resonance imaging and fluoroscopy due to the presence
of iron oxide nanoparticles as contrast agents for magnetic fields
and X-rays, respectively.7,42

to the vicinity of a tumor site. Step 2: Active navigation and precise
localization of the microswimmers at the site of medical intervention
by means of remote magnetic powering and steering. Step 3: Therapeutic
intervention with controlled cargo release based on the pathological
signal input at the tumor microenvironment. The present work reports
the MMP-2 enzyme that triggers boosted cargo release at pathological
concentrations, whereas physiological enzyme concentration goes undetected.
The degradation of microswimmers further enables full therapeutic
cargo bioavailability. Step 4: Complete biodegradation enables both
the safe removal of the microswimmers and the release of diagnostic
contrast agents. Step 5: Antibody-modified magnetic contrast agents
diffuse around to label the untreated tissue sites. The labeled sites
could thus be monitored in a minimally invasive manner to assess the
therapeutic efficiency of the treatment, and to identify the intervention
sites in the next round.

Conclusion
As the clinical interest of robotic devices
is shifting to the
development of small, autonomous, or remotely controlled systems,
challenges remain regarding material biocompatibility, biodegradability,
and execution of functional tasks in a programmed way. An ideal material
solution should convey the idea of short-term inertness in the body,
whereas a microrobot should be degradable with the lowest possible
waste profile in the long term. Here, we designed, explored, and characterized in vitro a hydrogel-based biodegradable helical microswimmer
remotely controlled by rotating magnetic fields. Owing to their emergent
physical properties and capability to protect labile drugs from degradation,
hydrogels could be programmed for various physiochemical interactions
with the encapsulated drugs to control drug release. The use of a
biopolymer derivative, gelatin methacryloyl, to make microrobots can
enable making patient-specific microrobots using their own biomaterials.
Such a personalized strategy could largely circumvent potential concerns
of immunogenicity. Over the past decade, a variety of microswimmers
has been proposed; however, here we complementarily concentrated on
the sensing and response to changes in the pathological microenvironment,
such as a disease marker enzyme, MMP-2, which triggered the microswimmer
to accelerate the therapeutic cargo release at the tumor site. Active
and targeted delivery of multifunctional cargo types, such as drugs,
imaging agents, genes, and RNA, are the major objectives of microrobotic
operations in order to make a theranostic impact in the near future.
Although such capabilities could enable high impact applications in
targeted delivery, microsurgery, tissue engineering, and regenerative
medicine, in the longer term, they could also provide treatment strategies
for genetic diseases by single-cell-level proteins or nucleic acid
delivery and roaming the body for disease prediction and prevention.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of a 3D-Printable
Superparamagnetic Magnetic Precursor
Gelatin methacryloyl
(100 mg mL–1), lithium phenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)
phosphinate (30 mg mL–1), iron oxide nanoparticles
(6 mg mL–1), coated with poly(ethylene glycol) amine,
of 50 nm hydrodynamic size (Chemicell GmbH, Germany), were mixed in
ultrapure water with vortex mixing and ultrasound sonication. The
resulting suspension was dropped on a glass slide, on which the fabrication
was carried out. Commercially available direct laser writing system
(Photonic Professional, Nanoscribe GmbH, Germany) with a 63×
oil-immersion objective (NA 1.4) was used for 3D printing of the microrobots via two-photon polymerization. Laser power and galvanometric
mirror x- and y-scanning speeds
were optimized for printing as 23.5 mW and 3.0 × 105 μm s–1, respectively (Supporting Information Figure S10). The overall microprinting
rate was measured to be 10 s for a single microrobot. DIC images were
taken with Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were made with a Zeiss Gemini
500 scanning electron microscope equipped with Quantax EDS (Bruker).

Microswimmers printed on glass substrate, and kept at 4 °C
refrigerator overnight in water, were equilibrated to room temperature
prior to recombinant human MMP-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) addition at various
concentrations (Figure 3B and Figure 4A).
Time-lapse images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope
at 20× magnification in the DIC mode. The enzyme solutions incubated
with the microswimmers were replenished every 12 h in order to minimize
the impact of enzymatic deactivation at long time periods. For analysis,
the length of the microswimmers (21 microswimmers for each time frame)
was measured using Nikon NIS AR Element analysis software.

In
order to investigate the toxicity of the microswimmer degradation
products, the viability of ErbB 2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells (DSMZ,
Germany) was tested by live/dead cell imaging kit (Invitrogen) after
24 h of treatment with degradation products (from 2349 microswimmers
degraded in 2 μg mL–1 MMP-2) and bare nanoparticles,
according to manufacturer’s instructions. SKBR3 cells were
cultured in McCoy’s 5a modified medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, penicillin (50 UI mL–1), and streptomycin (50
μg mL–1). Cells were grown at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in a humidified environment and subcultured before
confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cells with no treatment were used as
a control. Live and dead cells were observed under fluorescent microscope
using FITC and TRITC filters.

Drug Release Assay
Microswimmers printed on glass substrate
were loaded with a drug-equivalent macromolecule, dextran-FITC (Mw 10 000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich), by immersing
the glass into 1 mM dextran-FITC-containing aqueous solution overnight
at 4 °C. The microswimmers were equilibrated to room temperate
and washed with copious amount of water for 10 min before the drug
release measurements. Drug release from microswimmers was analyzed
using a spinning disc (Yokogawa, Japan) confocal microscope (Nikon
Eclipse Ti-E). Before the experiment, a separate array of microswimmer
was exposed to the varying intensities of laser light and exposure
times in order to eliminate the bleaching effect (Figure S13). Confocal fluorescence images were then acquired
from the actual release samples every hour for a period of 12 h, then
every 6 h by the end of 48 h. MMP-2 was added only in the beginning,
and no enzyme replenishment was done afterward. Fluorescence intensities
over 21 microswimmers were measured using Nikon software. Background
fluorescence was subtracted from the measured values.

Cellular Viability
and Targeted Cell Labeling
For cell
labeling assay, SKBR3 cells at 1 × 105 cells/mL density
were incubated with microswimmer degradation products (from 2349 microswimmers
degraded in 2 μg mL–1 MMP-2) in HEPES buffered
saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Nanoparticles without anti-ErbB 2 antibody
served as the negative control. After incubation, cells were centrifuged,
washed, and resuspended in buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD
FACSMelody). Untreated SKBR3 cells were used to set the gates, and
a total of 5000 events was acquired for each analysis after gating
on singlets (Figure S14).

Statistical
Analysis
All experiments were independently
repeated at least four times. In each repeat, at least 21 individual
microswimmers were counted. The error bars represent ± standard
deviation. The statistical analyses were done with one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA). A P value higher than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The quantitative results represent
the overall average of independent and technical replicas.
