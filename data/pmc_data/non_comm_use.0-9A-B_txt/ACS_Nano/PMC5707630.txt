Revealing
whether dislocations accelerate oxygen ion transport
is important for providing abilities in tuning the ionic conductivity
of ceramic materials. In this study, we report how dislocations affect
oxygen ion diffusion in Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM), a model
perovskite oxide that serves in energy conversion technologies. LSM
epitaxial thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to more than
100 nm were prepared by pulsed laser deposition on single-crystal
LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 substrates. The lattice mismatch
between the film and substrates induces compressive or tensile in-plane
strain in the LSM layers. This lattice strain is partially reduced
by dislocations, especially in the LSM films on LaAlO3.
Oxygen isotope exchange measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry
revealed the existence of at least two very different diffusion coefficients
in the LSM films on LaAlO3. The diffusion profiles can
be quantitatively explained by the existence of fast oxygen ion diffusion
along threading dislocations that is faster by up to 3 orders of magnitude
compared to that in LSM bulk.

Dislocations
play a crucial
role in many semiconductor applications and are well investigated.
For example, edge or screw dislocations in semiconductors act as Coulomb
scattering centers and reduce charge carrier density, mobility, and
lifetime, leading to a reduced electronic conductivity1−3 and worsened optical properties.1 It
is also well-known that atom diffusion along dislocations of metals
is faster than that in the bulk due to open space and low coordination
environment.4−7 The role of dislocations on diffusion of ions is much less studied
and understood, and most of the existing studies are theoretical calculations.8−10 Measurement of ion transport properties of individual dislocations
is far from trivial. SrTiO3 (STO) is one of the few materials
where the role of dislocations in single crystals was investigated
in depth. It was theoretically8−10 demonstrated that dislocations
in STO do not accelerate oxygen diffusion, and it was concluded from
oxygen isotope experiments10 that ion diffusion
perpendicular to dislocations is even slower. The detrimental role
of space charge zones, which deplete oxygen vacancy concentrations
and reduce oxygen diffusion coefficients substantially around dislocations
in SrTiO3, was also demonstrated experimentally and computationally.11 On the contrary, for UO2, an oxide
that does not have fast ion conduction in the bulk due to lack of
oxygen vacancies, it was reported that dislocations may act as a fast
pathway for oxygen diffusion.12 It is often
assumed that due to a decrease of the vacancy formation energy in
the dislocation core, a higher vacancy concentration may result compared
to the bulk. In the specific study on UO2, it was suggested
that the region close to misfit dislocations exhibits lower formation
energies for O2– and U4+ interstitial
ions.12

There are a few more studies
showing fast ion transport along dislocations,
for example, of oxygen in sapphire.13 Electrical
measurements in mechanically stressed AgCl single crystals also revealed
enhanced silver ion conductivity, most probably along space charge
zones adjacent to dislocations.14 Most
of the studies on ion transport in dislocations were performed on
single crystals, and the impact of dislocations on oxygen ion diffusion
in thin films has not been reported. Dislocations may affect not only
ion diffusion but also exchange kinetics of oxygen at the surface.
Also this has been hardly investigated so far. One study on La1–xSrxMnO3 (LSM) thin films reported a dependence of the surface exchange
coefficient on the strain state of the films, with higher values in
relaxed LSM layers, and this outcome was attributed to dislocations.15 This is also similar to recent findings on faster
oxygen ion conductivity along the grain boundaries of nanocrystalline
LSM thin films.16−19 Studies to date fall short of drawing a systematic picture of whether
dislocations inhibit or promote oxide ion conductivity and oxygen
surface exchange in mixed ionic electronic conducting oxides. We believe
the effect of dislocations is two-fold: properties may change in the
core, which has under-coordinated atoms and excess space, and in the
zone surrounding the dislocation, which can exhibit segregation of
point defects either due to the dislocation strain field20 or due to space charge formation under the effect
of the core potential.9,11

In this contribution, we
quantify the role of dislocations for
oxygen ion transport in LSM epitaxial thin films. LSM is an important
model of mixed ionic electronic conducting oxides and is widely studied
due to its functionality as a cathode in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).
It has suitably high electronic conductivity but a rather low ionic
conductivity.21−23 LSM thin films were prepared on single-crystalline
substrates, SrTiO3 (STO) and LaAlO3 (LAO), providing
tensile and compressive strain in the films, respectively. The relaxation
of strain in thin films occurs through the formation of dislocation
half-loops, leading to misfit dislocations at the film/substrate interface
in the fully relaxed state, and the dislocation density of partially
relaxed films may depend on the layer thickness.24,25 Existence of dislocations was confirmed in other studies of LSM
epitaxial layers on LAO substrates.26−28 Very thin epitaxial
films still accommodate the substrate lattice parameter, whereas larger
thicknesses lead to large strain energies and formation of misfit
dislocations becomes more favorable.28,29 In our study,
ion transport properties in strained LSM layers were investigated
by oxygen isotope exchange experiments with subsequent secondary ion
mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements. The obtained isotope exchange
depth profiles were analyzed by a finite element model that represents
diffusion both in the bulk and along dislocations perpendicular to
the surface of the thin films. We found that oxygen ion diffusion
along the dislocations is about 2–3 orders of magnitude faster
than that through the LSM bulk. In this case, dislocations can provide
fast pathways for accelerating oxygen ion diffusion in nanoscale LSM
thin films where a high density of dislocations is achievable.

Results
and Discussion
Structure of the LSM (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) Films
The bulk lattice parameter
of STO (aSTO = cSTO = 3.91
Å) is larger than that of LSM with the composition of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (aLSM = cLSM = 3.898 Å)30 and has a misfit of 0.31%, and thus tensile
in-plane strain can be expected for LSM on STO due to the relative
difference of the a parameter. On the other hand,
the LAO lattice parameter, aLAO = cLAO = 3.82 Å, is smaller than that of LSM
with the misfit of −2.04%, and compressive in-plane strain
should result for LSM on LAO. The structure of the as-prepared LSM
thin films on STO and LAO substrates with thicknesses (d) between 10 and 140 nm was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
as shown in Figure 1a,d. (We denote the LSM films on STO as LSM/STO and the LSM films
on LAO as LSM/LAO.) These XRD measurements indicate that the LSM films
are (100) oriented. Both c lattice parameters differ
from the LSM bulk value with a positive out-of-plane deviation for
LSM/LAO (in accordance with compressive in-plane stress) and the opposite
for LSM/STO. With increasing layer thickness, the c lattice parameter of the films slightly relaxes toward the LSM bulk
lattice parameter. The same behavior was also found in the reciprocal
space maps (RSM) for the 40 and 92 nm thick LSM/STO (Figure 1b,c) and for LSM/LAO (Figure 1e,f). In RSM measurements
on the 40 nm thick LSM/LAO, the LSM(103) and STO(103) peaks are at
the same position, which means that in-plane the LSM layer adopts
the lattice parameter of STO substrate. The 92 nm thick LSM/STO has
two patterns which originate from the relaxation of the lattice parameter.
The quantitative analysis of the c parameter from
XRD patterns (Figure 1h) gives the out-of-plane strain Δ (defined as Δ = (cfilm – cbulk)/cbulk, where cbulk is the bulk lattice parameter of the film material) in
each film. In LSM/LAO (which is in-plane compressively strained),
Δ can be as high as 3.43%. LSM/STO is in-plane tensile strained,
and the out-of-plane compressive strain is up to Δ = −1.09%.
The increase of LSM thickness relaxes the LSM c lattice
parameter, as shown in Figure 1h. However, even the thickest LSM layer on the LAO studied
here remains strained.

Figure 1 (a,d) High-resolution XRD measurements on LSM/STO and
LSM/LAO indicate
a relaxation with increasing thickness, as marked by the peak position
of the most strained (dashed line) and relaxed (solid line) lattice
parameters. The reciprocal space mapping on LSM layers (b,c and e,f)
also indicate lattice parameter relaxation from 40 to 87 nm/92 nm
thickness. (h) Out-of-plane lattice parameter c,
calculated from XRD data, and strain for LSM/STO and LSM/LAO as a
function of film thickness.

The surface topography of the as-prepared LSM thin films
was analyzed
by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Features of 3D island growth are
found, as shown in Figure 2a,c, on LSM/STO and LSM/LAO (both 10 nm thick). AFM measurements
on thicker layers (shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S1) showed that the root-mean-square (rms)
surface roughness increases with layer thickness from 0.15 nm (LSM
thickness 10 nm) to 0.63 nm (LSM thickness 126 nm), with the most
pronounced rms increment found for LSM layers thicker than 20 nm.
Increasing film thickness relaxes elastic strain via dislocation formation, and the resulting inhomogeneous strain distribution
can increase the film roughness, shown for SrRuO3/LaAlO3.31

Figure 2 (a,c) AFM images of surface
topography on LSM thin films (thickness d = 10 nm)
on STO and LAO substrates. (b) Dark-field transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image on LSM/STO and (d) bright-field TEM
image on LSM/LAO indicate that thin films are free of grain boundaries;
interface dislocations exist in LSM/LAO (in d marked by red circles).
(e) In the bright-field TEM image of LSM (126 nm) on LAO, fringes
can be observed that are usually related to structural irregularities
like threading dislocations, which at a certain thickness (ca. 114 nm) switch to edge dislocations parallel to the
interface. Thus, the interfacial part (ca. 12 nm,
red region above the interface) is free of threading dislocations.
(f) Principal sketch of dislocation half-loops, consisting of two
surface-terminated threading dislocations (TD), which may switch to
misfit dislocations (MD) parallel to the thin film/substrate interface.

The microstructure of the as-prepared
thin films was investigated
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Figure 2b,d (both measured on the 40
nm LSM). As one can see from the dark-field (DF) and bright-field
(BF) TEM images, the LSM films are grain-boundary-free and grew epitaxially
on both substrates. This can be confirmed from high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) images provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). HRTEM images on both types of substrates
(Figure S2b,e) show that the LSM lattice
follows that of the substrate. The lattice parameter c tends to relax from the LSM/substrate interface toward the LSM surface,
as shown in a more detailed HRTEM analysis (Figure S2c). The relaxation of strain in thin films is a complex process
(see below) and usually involves generation of dislocations.32

It is also important to note that all
the LSM layers formed on
LAO substrates contain special microstructural features shown in the
TEM image (Figure 2e). LSM layers have vertical structures and dark spots at the interface
or close to the interface, as shown in Figure 2d,e (more TEM images are shown in the Supporting
Information Figure S3). The vertical structures
in TEM images are usually related to dislocations.33−36 Additional geometric phase analysis
on the observed vertical feature was performed (shown in the Supporting Information) and revealed that the
crystal structure in the proximity of the observed vertical feature
is identical on both sides (Figure S4),
which is an indication of a threading dislocation. The dark spots
marked by red circles (Figure 2d,e) represent another structural feature that is commonly
attributed to the cores of misfit dislocations in the interfacial
region.37 Findings from the TEM images
hence suggest the existence of dislocation half-loops which consist
of two types of dislocations: perpendicular threading dislocations
(TD in Figure 2f) and
misfit dislocations (MD in Figure 2f) in the interface region. A more detailed discussion
of the dislocations is given below.

In order to further characterize
lattice relaxation and to estimate
the in-plane dislocation density in LSM, the in-plane lattice parameter a was measured on LSM/LAO (Figure 3a). The in-plane lattice parameter is very
sensitive to the density of dislocations with Burgers vectors parallel
to the film–substrate interface. Reciprocal space maps on LSM/LAO
thin films were collected using a ω angle of 0.25° and
by collecting multiple ϕ scans while changing 2θχ
in steps of 0.05°. Lattice parameters of LAO and LSM coincide
in the case of the 10 nm thick film, and this confirms that the LSM
layer is fully strained. The in-plane RSM shows that the LSM lattice
parameter relaxes for thicker films (Figure 3a). The comparison of all LSM/LAO films is
shown by the rocking curve graphs in Figure 3b. All the peaks in the ϕ scans on
the (200) plane of LSM layers thicker than 10 nm are broadened due
to the strain relaxation. The calculated in-plane lattice parameters
(a) and the ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane lattice
parameters (c/a) as a function of
thickness are shown in Figure 3c. The strain relaxation suggested by this thickness dependence
has to involve generation of dislocation with in-plane Burgers vectors,
such as interfacial misfit dislocations or edge dislocations in other
planes of the thin films.

Figure 3 (a) In-plane reciprocal space mapping on LSM/LAO
films. (b) Broadening
of the rocking curves on LSM/LAO indicates relaxation of the in-plane
lattice parameter with increasing film thickness. (c) In-plane lattice
parameter and the ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane to parameters
(c/a). Layers thicker than 20 nm
indicate only slight lattice parameter variations with thickness.
(d) Calculated density of dislocations (δ*) according to eq 1, and the average distance
between adjacent dislocations (w) shows a significant
change from 10 to 20 nm LSM thin films.

The in-plane dislocation density, δ*, in LSM films
was estimated
from the measured full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the Φ
scans (rocking curves of (200) reflection) at the diffraction spot
of LSM and was calculated using the following equation.38−40 1  Here,
δ* is the dislocation density
in the units of cm–1, and b is
Burgers vector. In this case, b equals the lattice
parameter of LSM along the (100) direction (3.898 Å). In obtaining
the fwhm of rocking curves, the fwhm of the 10 nm thick LSM/LAO was
used to represent the diffractometer profile and, thus, was subtracted
from the profiles of the thicker LSM thin films. The resulting density
of dislocations, δ*, and the average separation distance between
dislocations, w, are shown in Figure 3d. δ* varies from 4.67 × 104 cm–1 for the 10 nm film (i.e., w of nominally about 214 nm, largely limited by
the instrument) to 2.29 × 105 cm–1 (i.e., w of about 44 nm) for the
126 nm film.

In summary, from XRD and TEM analysis, we can conclude
consistently
that the LSM thin films are strained on STO and LAO substrates, and
particularly on LAO, the strain release with increasing thickness
involves generation of dislocations. The in-plane dislocation density
is significantly increased above 10 nm thick LSM/LAO films.

These results can be well understood within the framework of a
more general model on strain relaxation in thin films by the formation
of dislocations. This model was also used to describe epitaxial thin
film growth and dislocation propagation in semiconductors24,25,33,34 and is in agreement with some papers dealing with dislocations in
LSM.32,41−43 It is based on the fact
that during epitaxial (unrelaxed) growth of a thin film with lattice
mismatch, a high strain energy develops. At a certain layer thickness,
the strain energy becomes too high and formation of dislocations becomes
energetically more favorable (other types of defects such as stacking
faults and low-angle grain boundaries may also take part in the relaxation
mechanism; however, these were not observed in our study). A critical
thickness of 2.5 nm was reported for the LSM/LAO case.32 The dislocation propagation mechanism for further
layer growth was described in several publications.44−47 It is generally assumed that
dislocations start to nucleate either at the thin film surface or
at the thin film/substrate interface (more favorable when the substrate
has already many initial defects).48,49 For a surface
dislocation propagation mechanism, dislocation half-loops start at
the surface and then expand in size, as shown in Figure 4a. These dislocation half-loops
consist of two across-plane threading dislocations and an edge dislocation,
which is largely parallel to the interface.

Figure 4 (a) Growth of dislocation
half-loops starts at the surface; they
become larger with increasing film thickness, and during interaction,
they also grow to reach the substrate/thin film interface, thus forming
misfit dislocations along the interface and threading dislocations
across the thin film. (b) On the thin film surface, threading dislocations
appear, and due to the different structure and chemical composition,
they may cause a modified oxygen uptake and diffusion. The misfit
dislocation array refers to the LSM/LAO interface.

A dislocation half-loop represents the border of
the additional
or the missing lattice plane introduced for strain relaxation. However,
this specific additional or missing plane does not have to cover in
the entire film cross section, rather its growth starts very locally.
During further film growth, it then becomes broader. This is also
indicated in Figure 4a. The four half-loops sketched there are not one and the same additional
or missing plane shown for different times, but projections of four
different half-loops (planes) that have started to grow for different
film thicknesses. This also means that not all dislocations nucleate
for the same film thickness, but some start growing for larger thicknesses.
Further film growth thus leads to an increasing size and density of
dislocation half-loops. Soon the number and size of half-loops becomes
so high that they interact with each other, and also (interfacial)
misfit dislocations begin to form. This further contributes to the
strain relaxation. Finally, a whole array of extended misfit dislocations
has developed, and the entire film becomes fully relaxed. This model
of lattice relaxation by dislocations was verified for different thin
film systems.24,25 Similarly, for LSM on LAO, a
recent study showed growth of misfit dislocation arrays.32

Since we observed lattice relaxation during
film growth, assumption
of the above-mentioned model of lattice relaxation by dislocation
loops is plausible also for our layers. Moreover, the rocking curves
of RSM measurements indicated a high density of in-plane dislocations,
especially for thicker layers. However, even the thickest LSM layers
used in this study are still not completely relaxed. This suggests
that we still have a mixture of interfacial misfit dislocation arrays
and dislocation half-loops, ending in some distance from the interface.
This is sketched in Figure 4b; indication for both kinds of dislocations is also found
in TEM (Figure 2).
Completely relaxed layers should consist of the misfit dislocation
array only, and a thickness of such relaxed layers can be rather large,
for example, ca. 200 nm for BaTiO3 on
SrTiO3 (lattice mismatch 2.2%).47

The observation of a substantial in-plane lattice parameter
change
between 10 and 20 nm layer thickness and the accompanying increase
of the in-plane dislocation density indicates that the density of
dislocation half-loops becomes particularly high in some distance
from the LSM/LAO interface (Figure 2e). Threading dislocations of these dislocation half-loops
are perpendicular to the interface and have their termination at the
surface. Thus, they can contribute to perpendicular oxygen transport,
and this effect was studied by tracer diffusion in this work. Existence
of such perpendicular dislocations is also in agreement with the TEM
measurements shown in Figure 2. Please note that the interfacial misfit dislocation array
of a fully relaxed layer does not have a perpendicular component of
the Burgers vector and cannot lead to fast across-plane diffusion.
However, misfit (or in-plane edge) dislocations may still enable fast
in-plane oxygen diffusion.

Ion Transport Properties of the LSM Films
Oxygen isotope 18O exchange experiments were performed
at 600 °C on all
LSM films, and details on the exchange parameters are given in the Methods section. Typical isotope depth profiles
in LSM/STO and LSM/LAO are shown in Figure 5a for d = 40 nm. The isotope
profiles on LAO and STO have a rapid decay close to the LSM surface.
This part of the profile is attributed to (slow) bulk diffusion in
LSM. Please note that these (bulk) profile widths are within the depth
resolution of the instrument (cf. similar depth profiles found in
ref (19)). For LSM
on STO, the 18O isotope fraction drops within the first
10 nm from 90% to values close to the natural abundance (0.205%).
However, in LSM on LAO, after the first decay, there is a pronounced
additional tail in the profile with a much slower decay toward the
LSM/substrate interface. Hence, more than one diffusion mechanism
has to play a role in these LSM/LAO films. The detailed analysis of
LSM/STO films revealed also some deviations from a profile with only
one diffusion process; cf. our first data on oxygen diffusion in epitaxial
layers in ref (19) and
profiles of LSM/STO shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5), but the effects are much less pronounced
compared to those of LSM/LAO.

Figure 5 (a) Typical 18O tracer profiles measured
on 40 nm LSM/LAO
(red triangles) and LSM/STO (blue circles) are significantly different.
For LSM/LAO, a pronounced tail in the profile is observed. Both near-surface
regions are governed by diffusion through the bulk of LSM films (Db), whereas the substantial difference between
the two profiles (marked by magenta shaded area) is due to diffusion
along dislocations (Dd). (b) Model with
three domains (bulk, dislocations, and interface region) used to simulate
the 18O tracer diffusion profiles on LSM/LAO. (c,d) Comparison
of 18O tracer profiles obtained for different thicknesses
(d = 10–126 nm/140 nm) of LSM films on LAO
(c) and on STO (d); they reveal some variation of Db in LSM/LAO due to strain relaxation. (e) Effect of strain
is also visible when plotting tracer profiles obtained in the thinnest
LSM layers (10 nm) on LAO and STO (Db LSM/STO
≥ Db LSM/LAO). (f) Comparison of
tracer profiles of the thickest layers (126 nm/140 nm) on different
substrates shows a large difference beyond the near surface zone.

The 18O tracer profiles
with two regimes were also observed
in columnar LSM layers,16,19 where fast diffusion
along grain boundaries leads to a long diffusion tail. However, in
our epitaxial layers without grain boundaries (see Figure 2b,d,e), such a grain boundary
diffusion path cannot explain the results. Therefore, other phenomena
have to be responsible for the complex diffusion profile shape. It
has already been shown in other studies that tensile or compressive
lattice (elastic) strain may significantly increase or reduce the
diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the bulk, for example, in (La,Sr)CoO3−δ (LSC)50 or in La2NiO4+δ.51 It was
discussed above that thin LSM films on LAO are compressively strained.
Moreover, dislocations are present in LSM on LAO. Hence, elastic strain
as well as dislocations (plastic strain) may influence the diffusion
profiles. In the following, we show that indeed both lattice strain
and dislocations do affect the measured diffusion profiles in LSM,
but the pronounced tail in Figure 5a is primarily due to fast diffusion along dislocations.
Accordingly, data analysis was performed by the model sketched in Figure 5b. This model is
in agreement with the general considerations on thin film relaxation
by dislocation growth (see above) and is discussed in more detail
below.

The tracer profiles in LSM thin films with different
thicknesses
on STO and LAO substrates are given in Figure 5c,d. The variation of the thickness systematically
changes the profiles in the LSM/LAO case. From the slope of the bulk
related near-surface profile part, we already see that the bulk diffusion
coefficient Db increases with layer thickness
(i.e., relaxation of in-plane elastic compressive
strain). The thinner LSM/LAO layers are more in-plane compressively
strained and exhibit a lower Db. For LSM/STO,
on the other hand, thickness plays a smaller role. This variation
of the bulk diffusion coefficient in LSM/LAO is in accordance with
previous findings on Sr-doped LaCoO3−δ (LSC),
where compressive lattice strain lowered the oxide ion conductivity.50 The effect of strain can also be seen when comparing
the tracer profiles of the thinnest LSM films (10 nm) on STO and LAO
(Figure 5e); the in-plane
compressively strained LSM/LAO shows a slightly steeper decay and
thus a smaller bulk diffusion coefficient compared to the in-plane
tensile strained LSM/STO (Db LSM/STO > Db LSM/LAO). This effect is largely gone
for
the thickest LSM films (126 nm/140 nm) on both substrates (Figure 5f, Db LSM/STO ≈ Db LSM/LAO)
in accordance with the conclusion that those films are partially relaxed.
However, in these partially relaxed 126 nm/140 nm thick films, the
second diffusion regime becomes very pronounced for LSM/LAO (Figure 5f). Hence, the effects
of lattice (elastic) strain can explain the near-surface parts of
the profiles (Db) but cannot be the main
reason for the second diffusion regime represented by the extended
tail. We have noted above (Figure 3) that LSM/LAO films develops dislocations upon relaxation
of elastic strain. Therefore, we suggest oxygen diffusion along dislocations
as the origin of the second feature.

The following first quantification
of tracer profiles in LSM/LAO
thin films with different thickness gives further evidence that dislocations
are highly relevant. The bulk related near-surface parts of the measured
profile in Figure 6a (red line) were quantified with a single diffusion process, that
is, by an error function, as shown by the violet line in Figure 6a. The entire experimental
profiles and the fitted bulk profiles were then integrated. The areas
beneath both curves represent the tracer amount incorporated by bulk
diffusion only and by both bulk and second (dislocation) diffusion
processes. The importance of the second diffusion part can then be
estimated from the ratios of the integrals (∫(18O)bulk/∫(18O)), and this ratio is plotted
as a function of layer thickness in Figure 6b. The ∫(18O)bulk/∫(18O) ratio decreases with increasing LSM thickness
(Figure 6b, blue line),
and hence, the contribution of the second diffusion part increases
with increasing LSM film thickness. From an extrapolation of this
curve, we find that for a thickness of 2.8 nm, ∫(18O)bulk/∫(18O) is equal to 1 (absence
of a second diffusion regime, only bulk diffusion prevails).

Figure 6 (a) Experimental 18O isotope exchange depth profiles
(red line) were fitted with a single bulk diffusion process (Db) (violet line). (b) Experimental and fitted
profiles were integrated (∫(18O), ∫(18O)bulk). The ratio of the integrals ∫(18O)bulk)/(∫(18O) strongly decreases with increasing
LSM film thickness; the thinnest LSM film has the lowest contribution
of dislocations. The extrapolation of ∫(18O)bulk)/(∫(18O) to 1 leads to a critical thickness of 2.8 nm, and LSM
films thinner than that are considered free of dislocations.

The number of dislocations in
epitaxial layers generally increases
with layer thickness, and dislocations begin to appear in layers above
a critical relaxation thickness, dc. For
LSM films on LAO single crystal, this critical thickness was experimentally
determined to be 2.5 nm,32 and according
to theoretical calculations, it is 1.7 nm.32 This is in rather good agreement with the critical thickness of
2.8 nm estimated from our integral analysis of the tracer profiles.
The increased importance of the second diffusion process with increasing
film thickness and the consistency of the critical thickness in LSM
films deduced from our tracer integral analysis with that deduced
from previous structural characterization of LSM films32 support our interpretation that the second part
of the diffusion profiles is caused by oxygen diffusion along dislocations.

Based on these observations and the general considerations of dislocation
growth in thin films (see above), we can construct a finite element
model for quantitatively analyzing the measured profiles (see Figure 5b). Diffusion along
dislocations is usually described by a pipe with different diffusion
properties.52 The across-plane threading
dislocations of the supposed dislocation half-loops (cf. Figure 4b) are therefore
represented by a pipe perpendicular to the surface. At a certain depth
(at latest at the LSM/LAO interface), this pipe is deflected to an
in-plane edge dislocation. Adding such in-plane pipes to the model
geometry would lead to an overparameterization of our fit procedure
as their effect on the entire profile might be rather small. Hence,
those are not included in the model. Still, the deflection of the
dislocation half-loop is in agreement with the existence of an interfacial
region without fast across-plane dislocation diffusion, which we have
to introduce into our model for an accurate data analysis; see below.

Hence, our model includes a bulk region with diffusion coefficient Db and oxygen exchange coefficient kb, as well as a pipe-like dislocation with different diffusion
and oxygen exchange coefficients, Dd and kd (Figure 5b). The density of dislocations, δ, determines
their separation distance, w = 1/δ. The dislocation
core radius, r, can be estimated according to f/(1 – ν),53,54 where f is the plane spacing perpendicular to the slip plane and
ν is Poisson’s ratio. In studies on dislocations,55,56f is considered to vary from b to 4b, where b is Burgers vector.
For the sake of simplicity, the dislocation core radius was fixed
to 1 nm in our analysis. The LAO substrate is assumed to be ion blocking.

interfacial zone are shown as an example for the profile measured
on 87 nm LSM/LAO (Figure 7). An isotope depth profile with only a single (bulk) diffusion
process in the LSM film can quantitatively describe the near-surface
part of the profile. The calculated Db and kb are similar to those found in
our previous study on nanocrystalline LSM films19 (see Figure S6). Finite element
calculations including the contribution of the dislocations are shown
in Figure 7 (blue line)
and reproduce a large part of the measured profile. Please note that
the high tracer fraction in the center part of the film requires fast
tracer diffusion in the dislocation but largely reflects the tracer
ions that have leaked from the dislocation into the bulk (cf. the
diffusion tail of fast grain boundary diffusion observed in the so-called
Harrison-type B case).57

Figure 7 Experimental 18O tracer profile of a 87 nm thick LSM/LAO
film (green circles) was fitted with a model including only bulk contribution
(orange line) and a model including bulk and dislocation contribution
(blue line). However, to completely describe the experimental profile,
an additional contribution arising from the in-plane compressively
strained interface region must be included (red line).

In these calculated profiles, the dislocation diffusion
coefficient
is mainly reflected by the slope of the second part of the profile
(see also Figure S7c). The dislocation
exchange coefficient (kd) and the dislocation
density (δ) primarily affect the absolute value of the tracer
fraction in the second part of the profile. However, since their effects
on the profile are similar (Figure S7b,c), they cannot be obtained independently from such a data analysis.
This is discussed in more details in the Supporting Information (Figure S7). Fortunately, the resulting value
of Dd is hardly affected by the exact
choice of kd and δ. The estimated
dislocation densities in Figure 3d refer to both the edge and misfit dislocation, whereas,
here, we have to take only the yet-unknown density of the out-of-plane
threading dislocations. Hence, for the sake of simplicity, a fixed kd value was chosen for quantifying all measured 18O tracer depth profiles, and then the dislocations density
and Dd were adjusted as fit parameters.

The strong tracer fraction decay close to the LSM/LAO interface
(but still within LSM) indicates the existence of a further region
with different diffusion properties, and the sharpness of the decay
suggests a locally lower diffusion coefficient. A similar effect was
found in ref (51) for
La2NiO4+δ epitaxial thin films. This additional
LSM interfacial region was observed for all films thicker than 10
nm, and it could be well described by a thin layer with a thickness
Δi of typically 10–25 nm (Table 1) and a homogeneous diffusion
coefficient, Di (i.e., without fast diffusion along dislocations, cf. Figure 5b). Even though other effects
may also contribute, this layer might simply be caused by the ending
of most dislocation loops in some depth (see Figure 4), in accordance with the experimental observation
that the interface zone has more in-plane compressive lattice strain
and less dislocations (Figure 2e).

Table 1 Parameters Obtained by Fitting the
Measured 18O Depth Profiles of LSM/LAO with Finite Element
Calculationsa
a Db and kb are the bulk diffusion
and surface
exchange coefficient in LSM bulk; Dd and kd are the diffusion and surface exchange coefficient
through dislocations; Di is the diffusion
in the interface zone; Δi is the interfacial layer
thickness, and δ is the dislocation density.

Altogether, the finite element model
thus has to consist of three
domains (bulk, dislocation, and interfacial part), and the finite
element calculations were performed with five free parameters: Db, kb, Dd, Di, and δ = 1/w (kd was fixed at 7.0 ×
10–11 m·s–1; see above).
All parameters resulting from this numerical approximation to the
measured data are summarized in Figure 8a and Table 1. Only for the 10 nm film, the dislocation-related profile
part was not sufficiently developed for quantification.

Figure 8 (a) Diffusion
coefficients in bulk and along dislocations, Db and Dd, obtained
by finite element modeling of the experimentally measured 18O depth profiles, as a function of LSM film thickness on LAO substrate.
(b) 18O tracer depth profiles obtained on the same sample
but for different measurement positions. Db is constant at each sampled position, whereas the dislocation related
part (Dd) varies among different positions.

Most importantly, the diffusion
of oxygen along the dislocations
turns out to be much faster than bulk diffusion. For thick layers,
diffusion along dislocations is more than 3 orders of magnitude faster
than bulk diffusion. The estimated Dd values
seem to depend on the film thickness (see Figure 8a), and reasons are not clear yet. Some lateral
variations may be present, as indicated by the three different positions
shown in Figure 8b
for a 40 nm LSM film. However, one also has to keep in mind that the
dislocation-related curve part is rather short for thin layers, and
its slope depends less than linear on Dd, similar to the square root dependence between inverse slope and
grain boundary diffusion coefficient in the case of fast grain boundary
diffusion. Hence, also the accuracy of the Dd values is lower for thin films. Moreover, we may have a depth-dependent
threading dislocation density, even for a given thickness (cf. Figure 4), which was not
considered in the model. (Please note, the short tracer profile in
LAO is most probably a SIMS artifact due to intermixing during sputtering;
the natural abundance level was quickly reached, in accordance with
the very low tracer diffusion coefficient in the ionically blocking
LAO.)

Bulk diffusion coefficients in LSM/LAO increase only by
about a
factor of 2 for thicker layers (strain effect, cf. qualitative discussion
of Figure 5c), and
the dislocation density δ required to reproduce the results
for the given kd varied between 1.4. ×
105 and 3.3 × 105 cm–1 for the films of 20–126 nm. Despite the uncertainty of the kd value, we believe that most probably oxygen
incorporation into the dislocations is also faster than that into
the bulk, in accordance with differences found for grain boundaries
in LSM.19

As already mentioned above,
in-plane edge dislocations of dislocation
half-loops as well as interfacial misfit dislocations are not included
in our fit model. However, possibly we see the effect of in-plane
dislocations of half-loops as the hump before the sharp tracer decrease
in the interfacial region (Figure 7). Probably a large number of in-plane edge dislocations
exist close to the interface due to onset of dislocation growth after
exceeding a certain critical length. Across-plane tracer diffusion
thus becomes deflected to the horizontal direction at this depth.
Hence, the perpendicular leakage of tracer ions from the fast dislocation
into the bulk increases the local tracer fraction in this plane, and
a tracer fraction hump may result.

In order to support our interpretation
of only partly relaxed LSM/LAO
films in their as-deposited conditions, with dislocation half-loops
largely ending in some depth before the interface, we performed the
following experiment. We annealed 40 nm thick LSM films at 1000 °C
for 3 h and again performed a tracer exchange experiment with subsequent
SIMS analysis. AFM images indicate pronounced smoothening of the surface
(Figure 9a–c),
probably due to further lattice relaxation. Figure 9d,e displays the diffusion profile on the
annealed LSM/STO and LSM/LAO and, for comparison, also the profile
obtained on the as-deposited LSM/LAO. Clearly, and interestingly,
the tail reflecting fast dislocation diffusion across the LSM/LAO
film is largely gone after this annealing step, but the interfacial
hump strongly increases. This is exactly what one would expect when
the layer further relaxes upon annealing: after annealing, the dislocation
half-loops grow and interact, leading to an extended in-plane misfit
dislocation array at the interface, but much less dislocation half-loops
remain. Then the fast across-plane diffusion process becomes less
pronounced, but fast in-plane diffusion in the numerous interfacial
misfit dislocations may cause a significant diffusion hump (see sketch
in Figure 9f).

Figure 9 Surface topography
probed by AFM on both LSM/LAO (b) and LSM/STO
(c) samples annealed at 1000 °C and on as-prepared LSM/LAO (a).
This shows that annealed layers became smoother with a pronounced
terrace-like surface. Isotope exchange depth profiles reveal a hump
at the interface that can be explained by the fast oxygen diffusion
along in-plane misfit dislocations (f).

In general, faster diffusion through dislocations can be
explained
either by a higher vacancy concentration or by a higher mobility of
oxygen vacancies in the dislocation region. In our case, we think
that a higher oxygen vacancy concentration is more feasible due to
the different chemical composition that may surround the dislocation,
for example, due to possible Sr segregation in the vicinity of a dislocation,
which would cause a higher vacancy concentration, as known from the
studies of Sr doping in LaMnO3.58 An elastic strain field coupling to solute concentration is known
to produce dislocation-driven impurity segregation.20,59−62 Two recent studies42,43 on dislocations in LSM thin films
on LAO substrates have experimentally shown by electron energy loss
spectroscopy that the dislocation core is terminated with Mn columns
and an extra atomic plane of La/Sr columns. It was found that Mn at
the dislocation core occupies the La site and thus forms antisite
defects.42 Also, a higher oxygen vacancy
concentration in the dislocation core region was observed,42,63 which is in a good agreement with our study.

Conclusions
In summary, we have assessed oxygen ion diffusion in epitaxial
thin LSM films on LAO and STO single-crystal substrates and particularly
the effect of dislocations on this diffusion. XRD and reciprocal space
mapping showed that both LSM/LAO and LSM/STO are strained and relax
with increased layer thickness from 10 nm to more than 100 nm. Particularly
for LSM/LAO, generation of dislocations accompany strain relaxation,
confirmed by in-plane RSM and TEM. Measured 18O tracer
depth profiles show a pronounced difference between LSM/LAO and LSM/STO.
First, the LSM bulk diffusion coefficient Db in LSM/LAO is slightly lower than that for LSM/STO (for layers thinner
than about 90 nm). This is because the in-plane compressive lattice
strain in LSM/LAO lowers oxygen migration compared to the in-plane
tensile strain in LSM/STO. Consistent with strain relaxation, Db in LSM/LAO slightly increases with increasing
thickness.

Second and more importantly, in LSM/LAO, an additional
second diffusion
process was found. This process becomes very pronounced for thicker
LSM films and leads to significantly increased amounts of 18O in LSM. It could be explained by a fast ion transport along the
threading dislocations as part of dislocation half-loops in the film.
Finite element calculations were performed with a pipe diffusion model
along dislocations and an additional variation of diffusion close
to the film/substrate interface. This model fits the experimental
data very well. It was found that the diffusion of oxygen ions along
dislocations is about 2–3 orders of magnitude faster than that
in the bulk. Close to the LSM/LAO interface, diffusion becomes again
much slower, possibly due to the absence of many threading dislocations
in this region. Annealing of the LSM/LAO film to relax it further
caused annihilation of threading dislocations and strongly reduced
the across-plane diffusion.

The faster oxygen diffusion along
dislocations in LSM is different
from the behavior in SrTiO38−11 and Gd-doped ceria,20 where dislocations did not provide fast diffusion
paths. The reason for this difference might be the significant reducibility
of LSM accompanied by ease of Sr segregation possibly causing Mn antisite
defects and by the absence of any significant space charge effects
in LSM. The promoting effect of dislocations on oxygen ion transport
and surface exchange kinetics revealed here could be important for
tuning the kinetic properties of a broad range of reducible ionic
and mixed conducting oxides which do not form detrimental space charge
zones.

Methods
LSM thin films were prepared
by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).
The PLD target was produced from La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) powder, which was isostatically pressed into
pellets and sintered for 12 h at 1200 °C in air. Thin LSM films
were prepared on SrTiO3 (STO) (100) (CrysTec GmbH, Germany)
and LaAlO3 (LAO) (100) (CrysTec GmbH, Germany)
single crystals with varied layer thickness. Deposition was performed
under 1.3 × 10–2 mbar oxygen pressure at 650
°C using a KrF excimer laser with a wavelength of 248 nm and
a pulse frequency of 10 Hz. The laser beam energy was set to 400 mJ
per pulse and a target–substrate distance of 7 cm with a cooling
rate of 5 °C/min.

The thickness of the LSM layers was controlled
by deposition time
and later determined by transmission electron microscopy (FEI TECNAI
F20) from cross-section images and SIMS depth profiles and resulted
in the following values (TEM values with errors): 10 ± 1, 20
nm, 40 ± 3, 87 ± 2, and 126 ± 3 nm for LSM on LAO and
10 ± 1, 20, 40 ± 3, 92, and 140 nm for LSM on STO. The surface
morphology was characterized by atomic force microscopy using Veeco/Digital
Instrument Nanoscope IV. The AFM images were processed using the Nanoscope
software version 5.31R1 (Digital Instruments).

X-ray diffraction
2θ–ω scans, RSM, and in-plane
RSM of epitaxial layers were performed with a high-resolution four-circle
Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer, which is equipped with a Göbel
mirror, four-bounce Ge(220) channel-cut monochromator, Eulerian cradle,
and a scintillation counter, using Cu Kα1 radiation. The thickness
of the thinnest epitaxial layers was also analyzed by X-ray reflectivity
(XRR) measurements performed on Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer equipped
with two-bounce Ge(220) channel-cut monochromator using Cu Kα1
radiation. From XRR measurements (not shown), the thickness of these
epitaxial layers was again found to be 10, 20, and 40 nm.

The
in-plane XRD on LSM thin films was performed using a Rigaku
SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. A 0.5° parallel slit collimator
was used at the incident beam side to limit the divergence during
the in-plane measurement. Reciprocal space maps on LSM thin films
were collected using a ω angle of 0.25° and by collecting
multiple Φ scans while changing 2θχ in 0.05°
steps. For the fwhm of rocking curves, the fwhm of 10 nm LSM/LAO was
used to represent the diffractometer profile and thus subtracted for
thicker LSM thin films.

The isotope exchange was performed in
a gastight exchange chamber
at 200 mbar 97.1% 18O oxygen isotope (Campro Scientific,
Germany) at 600 °C. The unavoidable evacuation step before filling
the sample chamber with tracer gas annihilates any chemical pre-equilibration.
Therefore, a contribution of chemical diffusion cannot be avoided,
but this contribution is expected to be negligible due to the small
concentration of oxygen vacancies in LSM. The isotope exchange lasted
for 240 min, and subsequently, samples were quickly quenched to room
temperature with a cooling rate of 100 °C/min. Some additional
exchange experiments were performed in a temperature ranging from
400 to 800 °C (the results are shown in the Supporting Information).

The resulting 18O depth profiles were subsequently investigated
by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) (ION-TOF
GmbH, Germany ToF-SIMS 5). SIMS measurements were performed in the
collimated burst alignment mode with Bi3++ primary
ions (25 keV), which allows accurate determination of 18O concentrations in a broad intensity range. Negative secondary ions
were analyzed in areas of 70 × 70 μm2, using
a raster of 512 × 512 measurement points. For the sputtering
of material, 2 keV Cs+ ions were applied with a sputter
crater of 350 × 350 μm2 and sputtering ion current
of 50 nA. The charging of surfaces was compensated by an electron
flood gun. The depth profiles of isotope fraction (f(18O)) were obtained by normalizing integrated intensities I of 18O and 16O according to 2
