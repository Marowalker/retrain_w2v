Robust luminophores
emitting light with broadly tunable colors
are desirable in many applications such as light-emitting diode (LED)-based
lighting, displays, integrated optoelectronics and biology. Nanocrystalline
quantum dots with multicolor emission, from core- and shell-localized
excitons, as well as solid layers of mixed quantum dots that emit
different colors have been proposed. Here, we report on colloidal
supraparticles that are composed of three types of Cd(Se,ZnS) core/(Cd,Zn)S
shell nanocrystals with emission in the red, green, and blue. The
emission of the supraparticles can be varied from pure to composite
colors over the entire visible region and fine-tuned into variable
shades of white light by mixing the nanocrystals in controlled proportions.
Our approach results in supraparticles with sizes spanning the colloidal
domain and beyond that combine versatility and processability with
a broad, stable, and tunable emission, promising applications in lighting
devices and biological research.

==== Body
Even after
more than two decades
of extensive research, the optical properties of colloidal semiconductor
nanocrystals, also known as quantum dots (QDs),1 continue to intrigue researchers in nanophotonics, materials
science and biology. Compared to solid-state QDs, colloidal QDs have
a smaller and more easily tunable size.2 This means that, due to strong exciton confinement, the light emission
is tunable over a wide wavelength range in the visible or near-IR.
Moreover, epitaxial engineering in core–shell systems has advanced
remarkably over the past decade. This resulted in photochemically
stable QDs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield close to unity.3,4 Furthermore, the control over epitaxial core–shell synthesis
enabled the community to explore new degrees of freedom brought by
engineering of the exciton wave functions,5 resulting in reduced Auger recombination,6−8 brighter multiexciton
emission, and lower lasing thresholds.9−11 There is no doubt that
following these recent advances, colloidal QDs will be used in a wide
variety of applications, ranging from biological research12−14 to luminescent light concentrators15−17 and displays.18

Nowadays, two of the most important applications
of colloidal QDs
are their use as spectral conversion phosphors in light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) and in (the backlight of) liquid crystal (LC) displays. In
LEDs aimed at general lighting applications, the main role of QDs
is to partially convert the primary blue light from the LEDs into
multicolored light, with a spectrum matching human needs. In LED technology,
where a high power efficiency is paramount, QDs have shown to be valuable
for two different reasons: (i) they have a high quantum yield, and
(ii) they are narrow band emitters. When QDs are used as a red phosphor
instead of traditional wide-band red emitters, the red emission of
an LED lamp is possible without losing photons in the near-IR, thereby
significantly boosting the power efficacy (lumen/watt) of the lamp.
Additionally, by using mixtures of differently colored QDs, it is
relatively easy to achieve a high color rendering index lamp (CRI
> 90), compared to traditional phosphors. Regarding display technology,
QDs have shown to be valuable for their size-dependent tunable, narrow-band
emission, which enables a strong matching of the backlight emission
with the color filters of the display, thereby enhancing brightness
and color saturation. In displays, QDs are already applied commercially.
In order to strengthen these properties and enhance the suitability
of QDs for industrial applications, especially for white light emission,
several approaches have been proposed: QDs doped with metal ions,19,20 ultrasmall CdSe QDs,21,22 or QDs that show a relatively
broad spectrum due to multiexciton emission23 or shell emission.24 All of these materials
show only partially tunable emission spectra. Moreover, the spectra
change with the intensity of the excitation, thus hampering several
applications. A simple approach would be to mix three types of colloidal
semiconductor QDs with emission in the red, green, and blue, respectively.
In this respect, attempts based on mixed thin films of QDs have been
reported.25

Here, we report an approach
that results in spherical supraparticles
(SPs) that are composed of QDs emitting in the red, green, and blue.
By controlling the ratios of QDs per SP, we can easily and rationally
tune the spectrum of the SPs, and the emission spectrum is independent
of the excitation intensity in a wide range. The SPs are charge- and
sterically stabilized colloids themselves and can be dispersed in
many industrially relevant polar solvents, including water. In addition,
their much larger size as compared to individual QDs also makes them
easier to process in an industrial setting. Our work presents a platform
for easily processable colloidal particles with a bright and stable
(non-blinking) emission of pure or composite color, tunable in the
entire visible range. Such a platform holds promise for displays as
well as optoelectronical and biological applications.

Results/Discussion
Synthesis
and Composition of the Tunable Emitting SPs
The first step
in the realization of SPs is to synthesize the constituent
QDs. For this, we adapted existing protocols for stable red, green, and blue emitting
Cd(Se,ZnS) core/(Cd,Zn)S shell QDs (Figure 1) (see SI for
further information).

green emitting QDs (diameter: 11.0 ± 1.1 nm), and (c) the blue
emitting QDs (diameter: 10.5 ± 1.3 nm). Insets are models of
the QDs. (d–f) Absorption (dashed lines) and emission (solid
lines) spectra of three different populations of QDs used for the
self-assembly.

Our general approach
for the self-assembly of the SPs is based
on the drying of an oil-in-water emulsion at elevated temperatures
(68 °C) as described previously26,27 (details given
in the SI). In Figure S1 the synthesis procedure is schematically presented. The
emulsification is performed through a methodology developed by the
Bibette group that uses high shear rates generated in a Couette shear
cell28 combined with the viscoelasticity
of a concentrated emulsion; this leads to fairly monodisperse breakup
of the droplets. In this manner, SPs with a precise size can be produced
in a size range between 100 nm and several micrometers (Figure.S2).

The three types of QDs that
are incorporated in the SP are of similar
size, and they have the same inorganic outer shell (ZnS) and organic
ligands (oleic acid). However, the sizes are different enough that
the effective polydispersity of the mixture is above 10%, which should
prevent crystallization of the QDs into a long-range ordered superstructure.
We therefore expect that the three types of QDs will be randomly packed
and homogeneously distributed in the SPs in proportion to their concentration
in the precursor suspension of mixed QDs.

Structural Characterization
of the SPs
The surface
structure of the as-prepared SPs can be studied by detection of secondary
electrons (SE) in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)
(Figures 2a and S3). To investigate the inner structure of the
SPs, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HAADF-STEM) is combined with electron tomography29,30 (Figure 2b–e).
Hereby, a tilt series of HAADF-STEM images (Figure 2b) is acquired along different viewing directions
and is combined into a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction (Figure 2c) using a mathematical
algorithm (see SI). In Figure 2d we present a slice through
the 3D reconstruction yielding the internal structure. This image
as well as the fast Fourier transform in Figure 2e clearly show that the QDs are not ordered
in the SPs, thus forming an amorphous glassy structure, as expected.
In order to investigate the type of packing in the assemblies in more
detail, the coordinates extracted from the tomography reconstruction
were used to calculate bond order parameters.31,32 The analysis excluded the presence of periodic arrangements of particles.
It was shown previously26 that if the composing
QDs have the same size and a regular spherical shape and their interactions
can be approximated well with that of a hard-sphere potential, then
the SPs form crystalline structures with an icosahedral or face-centered
cubic structure. In our case, the composing QDs mixtures are characterized
by a relatively high polydispersity and an irregular shape; this leads
to a random arrangement of the QDs inside the SPs with a high packing
fraction. This is confirmed by the radial distribution function (RDF)
(Figure S4), which is calculated through
the identification of the single QDs inside a SP (Figure S5). The RDF shows an average distance between nearest
neighbors of 10.9 nm, which is in agreement with the particle size
derived from TEM images.

SPs (scale bar 200 nm). The inset shows a magnification of one of
the particles (scale bar 20 nm). Individual QDs can be clearly distinguished.

nm). Individual QDs can be clearly recognized as well as their relative
position, showing the irregular inner structure. (e) Fast Fourier
transform of the slice of panel d (scale bar 0.1 nm–1).

The 3D analysis of the SPs by
electron tomography also enables
us to verify whether the QDs are homogeneously mixed in each of the
SPs. In Figure S6a–c, HAADF-STEM
images acquired from the individual red, green, and blue population
are presented. The shape of the red emitting QDs is more spherical
in comparison to the other types. The intensity in HAADF-STEM images
depends on the atomic number Z. Energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements on the individual QDs (Figures S7–S10) show that the red emitting
particles contain a higher amount of Cd in their structure compared
to the green and blue ones (Table S1).
In this manner, we conclude that the high intensity particles in the
orthoslices correspond to red emitting particles. Visual inspection
of the QDs in the orthoslices in Figure 2d shows that the different QDs are homogeneously
mixed in each SP. The homogeneous distribution of the QDs in the SPs
was further confirmed by EDS measurements (Figure S11). From Figure S11 it is clear
that all the elements, and in particular Se (which is not present
in the blue emitting QDs), were found to be homogeneously distributed
inside the SP, thus supporting our statements about the homogeneous
distribution of the QDs inside the SPs.

Optical Characterization
of Individual SPs and Ensembles
We use confocal microspectroscopy
to study the optical properties
of our SPs (Figure 3). Microscopy of individual micron-sized SPs, larger than the diffraction
limit, demonstrates that the emission of the red, blue, and green
light does not vary spatially within a SP (Figures 3a,b and S12).
This agrees with the homogeneous mixing of the QDs in each SP as derived
from electron tomography measurements (see above). Confocal microscopy
also confirms uniform emission spectra among all SPs in one batch.
Even SPs from one synthesis batch but with different sizes show similar
PL emission spectra (Figures 3c–e and S13).

image of different SPs (scale bar 1 μm). The blue-green emission
(450–550 nm) is shown in green, while the red emission (600–700
nm) is shown in red; the image is deconvolved through the modeling
of the point spread function of the microscope. The inset shows the
signal collected along the white line drawn in the figure coming from
the two detectors. (c–e) Emission spectra of some of the SPs
presented in panel a, indicated with the green, red, or blue frame.

Using (time-resolved) PL spectroscopy,
we study in more detail
how the ensemble-averaged optical properties of the SPs relate to
those of the separate constituent QDs (Figure 4). In Figure 4a the emission spectra are compared. The contributions
from the separate NC populations (colored lines) are clearly distinguished
in the composite emission spectrum of the SP (black). This is to be
expected because (i) the constituent QDs are too far apart to exhibit
quantum mechanical coupling that could otherwise change the energy
levels and (ii) the SPs are too polydisperse for whispering gallery
modes27 to appear in the ensemble emission
spectrum. Nevertheless, the peak position of the blue contribution
to the SP emission (black line) is slightly red-shifted from the peak
position of the dispersion of blue QDs (blue). This indicates energy
transfer among blue QDs in the SP and/or from blue QDs to the green
and red QDs. Most likely, both Förster-type energy transfer
(i.e., by dipole–dipole coupling)
and photon reabsorption contribute to this. We wish to remark that
the emission spectrum of the composed SPs is independent of the excitation
intensity in the broad range of single exciton excitation (up to 14
mW) (Figure S14). This is an important
asset compared to previous proposals in which a broad emission was
reached by simultaneous exciton and biexciton emission23 or shell emission.24

Figure 4 Optical
properties of SPs compared to suspensions of the constituent
QDs. (a) Emission spectrum of an ensemble of white light-emitting
SPs (black) and of the three separate dispersions of the constituent
QDs (colored; each scaled to match the maximum intensity of the corresponding
peak in the composite spectrum). (b) PL decay traces of red QDs freely
dispersed in toluene (red closed circles), assembled in water-dispersed
SPs of red QDs (red open circles), and assembled in a white light-emitting
SPs (gray open circles). The red line is a fit to the PL decay of
red SPs, and the black line to the decay of white-light emitting SPs
(see Supporting Information for an explanation
of the fitting procedure). Same for (c) green QDs and (d) blue QDs.

In Figure 4b–d
we show the PL decay dynamics of the three batches of QDs freely dispersed
in toluene (closed circles) compared to QDs assembled into a SP (open
circles). The suspension of the red emitting QDs shows the slowest
PL decay, followed by the green and the blue emitting QDs, qualitatively
in agreement with the frequency dependence of the optical transition
strengths.33 The decay dynamics of the
same batches of QDs assembled in water-dispersed SPs are consistently
faster. More precisely, the PL of SPs consisting purely of red QDs
(red open circles) decays 66% faster than that of freely dispersed
QDs in toluene (see Supporting Information for a description of our analysis procedure). The decay of the red
component in mixed white light-emitting SPs (black open circles) is
33% faster than the red NC dispersion. For the green emission, these
acceleration factors are 41% for the purely green SPs and 32% for
the mixed SPs; for the blue emission 29% and 211%.

Multiple
collective effects simultaneously affect the decay dynamics
in the SPs. For example, the local density of optical states (LDOS),
which determines the rate of radiative decay, is higher for QDs in
a SP than for those freely dispersed in toluene. We estimate the LDOS
in a SP using a simplified model, where the SP is assumed to be a
perfect sphere with a homogeneous refractive index, which can support
Mie resonances (Figure S15). This model
predicts that the LDOS, averaged over the volume of the SP and orientation
of the transition dipole moments, is approximately two times larger
in a SP than for free QDs (Figure S15).
Indeed, the PL decay in SPs is always faster than for dispersed QDs
(Figure 4b–d).
However, the acceleration is less pronounced than the simplified Mie
model predicts, which can in part be due to damping of the Mie resonances
by refractive index inhomogeneities and absorption in the SP. Moreover,
the PL decay dynamics observed can be affected by Förster energy
transfer among QDs and reabsorption of emitted light.

We can
get some insight into the occurrence of Förster energy
transfer in the SPs by comparing the PL decay dynamics in pure-color
SPs (colored open circles in Figure 4b–d) and mixed white light SPs (gray open circles).
In pure-color SPs energy transfer can occur only among QDs from the
same (inhomogeneously broadened) color population. Mixed SPs enable
additional transfer between populations from blue to green, blue to
red, and green to red. Indeed, the blue PL decay (Figure 4d) is faster in mixed SPs than
in pure SPs because of these additional decay channels. The red PL
(Figure 4b) is slower
in mixed SPs, because the red QDs are fed through energy transfer
from the blue and green populations. The green PL decay is approximately
equally fast in pure and mixed SPs, which indicates that the effects
of feeding from the blue population and transfer to the red compensate
each other. Detailed modeling of these energy-transfer processes and
their effect on the color output depends on many factors (e.g., the degree of inhomogeneous broadening
and the separations and relative orientations of the QDs in the SP).
This is beyond the scope of the current work. Nevertheless, these
effects must be taken into account in the composition of the SPs if
a certain desired shade of white light is targeted (see below), and
in our case this was done empirically.

Lighting applications require photochemically stable SPs,
while
many biolabeling applications require time-constant emission from
individual SPs, without blinking or dark periods. Our SPs show bright,
non-blinking, and non-bleaching emission on the single-SP level over
a time period of at least 3000 s (Figure S16). This stability is an important asset compared to conventional
optical labels, for example, silica particles filled with organic
dyes such as rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC).34 Concerning the non-blinking feature, we remark that this is due
to the concomitant emission of many QDs in each SP. We also remark
that the size of the SPs can be tuned up to 100 nm, that they can
be dispersed in water, if needed, coated by a thin silica layer, and
that the surface can be biofunctionalized at will. Thus, the NC SPs
presented here, emitting one color or a combination of two or three
fundamental colors, are suitable as biological labels.

For application
of the SPs as spectral conversion phosphors in
lighting, the precise tunability of the white light spectrum is of
great importance. To study this, we convert the pure spectra of the
constituent QDs and the composite spectra of the SPs to coordinates
of the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE)
chromaticity space (Figure 5). The vertices of the triangle are the coordinates of the
three QDs components. The better the color purity of the single NC
components, the larger the area of the triangle in the CIE space.
The area inside the triangle represents all the colors that can be
achieved by composing SPs from the three different QDs used here.
The color purity of the QDs, as used here, is another important advantage
of NC SPs over regular phosphors that usually have a broad emission
spectrum. The black dots within the triangle in Figure 5 represent color points that we obtained
by assembling our QDs into SPs. A given broad SP emission spectrum
can be achieved and fine-tuned if one knows the emissive strength
of the red, green, and blue emitting QDs and takes the lower effective
emission yield from the blue-emitting particles into account, in a
few experimental iterations (see Figure S17). We remark that a targeted composite emission spectrum will remain
independent of excitation intensity over a broad excitation regime
as long as the steady-state exciton population remains below unity.

Conclusions
We
have reported the synthesis and structural and optical characterization
of colloidal water-soluble SPs composed of three types of QDs. The
SPs can be fabricated to emit pure colors as well as a broad white
light spectrum (or anything in between) that can be fine-tuned via the NC composition of the SPs. The bright emission from
individual SPs is stable over time and does not blink. Such SPs hold
promise as phosphors in LEDs for lighting, opto-electrical integration
in semiconductor chips and as biological labels.

Methods
Synthesis
of QDs
Three different populations of Cd(Se,ZnS)
core/(Cd,Zn,S) shell QDs emitting in different regions of the visible
spectrum were synthesized according to a modified literature procedure.35−37 For further details about the synthesis and characterization procedure
see the Supporting Information. The QDs
were precipitated by centrifugation with the addition of a MeOH:BuOH
3:1 v/v solution and redispersed in cyclohexane to form stock solutions
with a concentration of 8–15 mg/mL.

Synthesis of SPs
For the SPs, the three different solutions
of core/shell QDs were mixed in the desired ratio to a total volume
of 1 mL and then mixed with 10 mL water containing sodium dodecyl
sulfate and dextran. The mixture was sheared at a shear rate of 7
× 103 s–1 in a shear cell with a
gap of 0.1 mm, and the resulting oil-in-water emulsion was heated
at 68 °C for 4 h. The resulting SPs were precipitated by centrifugation,
and the supernatant, containing surfactants and dextran in excess,
was discarded. SPs were redispersed in deionized water. For a detailed
description of the methods and equipment used, see the Supporting Information.

Electron Microscopy
HAADF-STEM images, SE-STEM images,
EDS maps, and electron tomography series of the SPs were acquired
using a FEI Osiris and a FEI Tecnai electron microscopes operated
at 200 kV. Electron tomography series were acquired by using a Fischione
model 2020 single tilt tomography holder. The series were acquired
within the tilt ranges from −64° to +74° and from
−76° to +64° and a tilt increment of 2°. For
the reconstruction of the series, the simultaneous iterative reconstruction
technique (SIRT) was used, implemented in the ASTRA toolbox.38−40

HAADF-STEM images and EDS maps of the QDs were acquired using
an aberration-corrected “cubed” FEI Titan 60–300
electron microscope operated at 120 kV, equipped with a ChemiSTEM41 system.
