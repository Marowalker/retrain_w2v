Supraparticles consisting of nano- or microparticles
have potential
applications as, for example, photonic crystals, drug carriers, or
heterogeneous catalysts. To avoid the use of solvent or processing
liquid, one can make supraparticles by evaporating droplets of aqueous
suspensions from super-liquid-repellent surfaces. Herein, a method
to adjust the porosity of supraparticles is described; a high porosity
is desired, for example, in catalysis. To prepare highly porous TiO2 supraparticles, polymer nanoparticles are co-dispersed in
the suspension. Supraparticles are formed through evaporation of aqueous
suspension droplets on superamphiphobic surfaces followed by calcination
of the sacrificial polymer particles. The increase of porosity of
up to 92% resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity while maintaining
sufficient mechanical stability.

==== Body
Supraparticles are agglomerates
of primary nano- or microparticles with a typical size from a few
10 μm to several 100 μm. For simplicity, we call the all
primary particles nanoparticles in the following. As agglomerates,
supraparticles assemble nanoparticles into larger entities, making
handling and recovery easier, while reducing the hazards associated
with the high mobility of the primary nanoparticles.1 As an entity, such a superstructure can combine functionalities
of the nanoparticles, e.g., high specific surface
area, intrinsic material property, catalytic activity. Moreover, supraparticles
may exhibit improved functions due to the synergism, coupling, and
colocalization, which exceed the performance of simple sum function
of primary building blocks.2 Therefore,
supraparticles have attracted considerable attention and shown specific
structure and potential applications,3,4 such as absorber
materials in chromatography, for heterogeneous catalysis,5 for making photonic crystals,6 drug carriers,7 or energy production
and storage materials.8,9

A variety of fabrication
methods has been developed. Most of the
supraparticles are prepared in solution,10e.g., by kinetics/thermodynamics-controlled
growth or template-based synthesis. For kinetics/thermodynamics-controlled
growth methods, the self-assembly of nanoparticles is triggered by
weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding, solvophobic interactions,
and dipole–dipole interactions.11−16 Instead, in template-based synthesis the assembly is controlled
by using a template such as emulsions, mini-emulsions, block copolymer
structures, or droplets prepared through microfluidics.17−20 While being suitable for large-scale production, these approaches
depend on chemicals, especially for size and composition engineering,
which need to be separated from the supraparticles and disposed of
afterward. These chemicals may harm the environment and their use
consumes energy. Therefore, developing simple strategies to reduce
or completely avoid the use of solvent, emulsifiers, templates, or
any other processing liquid is desirable.

Recently, evaporation-induced
self-assembly has been introduced
as a promising strategy for the fabrication of supraparticles. Supraparticles
are prepared by evaporation of sessile dispersion droplets on superhydrophobic
surfaces.21,22 On simple hydrophobic surfaces, a deposited
dispersion droplet will have the shape of a spherical cap. The contact
line will be mostly pinned during evaporation. Pinning leads to contact
angles below 90° and to a higher evaporation rate of water near
the contact line. As a result, liquid flows from the center of the
droplet toward the contact line. This flow pattern inside the droplet
leads to the formation of a ring- or doughnut-like structure of the
final deposit.23−25 On superhydrophobic surfaces, however, the apparent
contact angle of water droplets is above 150°, leading to an
almost spherical droplet shape with small contact area between the
droplet and substrate. As a consequence, the evaporation of water
is isotropic, ensuring that the droplet will maintain a spherical
morphology during the evaporation process, since water molecules can
also evaporate into the porous structure of the superhydrophobic substrate.
This symmetric evaporation leads to an almost spherical shape of the
supraparticle. In addition, it avoids temperature-induced Marangoni
flow in the evaporating droplet.26 As the
evaporation process could be easily controlled, Velev etal. were able to produce opalescent supraparticles
by forming colloidal crystals inside.21,27 Colloidal
crystals are formed when nanoparticles repel each other even at a
very high nanoparticle density in the later stage of drying. In contrast,
irregular porous packings are favored when particles are not as stably
dispersed and attract each other at some stage.22,28−33

A limitation of superhydrophobic surfaces is the restriction
to
use aqueous electrolyte solutions. Nonpolar liquids or surfactant
solutions cannot remain in the Cassie state and impale into the structures.
Furthermore, the supraparticles are sometimes not easy to release
from the substrate.

Superamphiphobic surfaces overcome these
limitations for supraparticle
fabrication, since they repel not only water but also nonpolar liquids,
surfactant, or protein solutions. Droplets on such surfaces have high
contact angle (CA > 150°) and roll off easily (tilting angle
<10°), while the interfacial area between liquid and solid
is extremely small (≪V2/3).34−36 In addition, the highly porous superamphiphobic surface leads to
an almost radially symmetric evaporation, like in levitated droplets.
Furthermore, the release of dried supraparticles from the substrate
is facilitated because their adhesion to superamphiphobic surfaces
is usually lower than to superhydrophobic surfaces.36

Preparation of supraparticles on superamphiphobic
surfaces not
only avoids the expensive purification from a continuous aqueous phase
and the migration and aging effects resulting from slow phase separation
between particles and stabilizers, but also facilitates producing
supraparticles with various sizes, compositions, and architectures
by simple alternations of particle concentrations without consuming
additional chemicals and energy. Porosity is a critical parameter
for supraparticles, which has a great influence on the performance
in practical applications, such as heterogeneous catalysis, absorber
materials, and drug carriers.5−7 For many applications, one needs
highly porous supraparticles to facilitate diffusion of analytes or
reactants. Porosity can be increased by allowing the dispersed particles
to aggregate partially. If the nanoparticles attract each other in
the later stage of the evaporation, they tend to form a more porous
structure rather than forming a dense packing. Porosity achieved in
this way is, however, limited: during the last stage of evaporation,
strong compressive capillary forces act on the nanoparticle aggregates,
leading to densification of loose agglomerates.

Herein, we propose
a method to increase the porosity of supraparticles
and circumvent the limit set by capillary compression. We prepared
TiO2 supraparticles with hierarchical porosity by first
constructing TiO2–polystyrene (PS) binary supraparticles
on superamphiphobic surfaces and then removing the PS phase by calcination.
By regulating the concentration and droplet volume of the mixed particle
dispersions, the size of the spherical TiO2 supraparticles
could be controlled. The porosity of superparticles is related to
the volumetric ratio of TiO2 to PS. We demonstrate that
the hierarchical porous structures of the TiO2 supraparticles
enhance photocatalytic performance in degrading rhodamine B (RhB).
Our approach for regulating the inner structure of supraparticles
will allow optimizing them for specific applications.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication of Porous Supraparticles
Highly porous
supraparticles were fabricated by first depositing a droplet of a
binary nanoparticle suspension on a superamphiphobic surface (Figure 1a). While water evaporates
and the volume of the droplet decreases, the confinement leads to
concentration of nanoparticles inside the droplet. The droplets we
use were nearly spherical at the beginning because their radius r ≈ 770 μm was lower than the capillary constant
of κ = 2.7 mm. During the evaporation, the scaled radius r/κ decreases further, leading to an even more precise
spherical shape. A solid binary supraparticle with spherical shape
is formed. Then a calcination process was applied to remove the polymer
components, forming supraparticles with highly porous structures.
The evaporation was conducted on nanofilament-based superamphiphobic
surfaces, which were prepared by hydrolysis of silane (Figure 1b).37,38 The obtained superamphiphobic surface exhibits good liquid repellent
properties with roll-off angles for water and hexadecane droplets
(V = 5 μL) of 4° and 8°, leading
to a highly spherical-shaped droplet (Figure 1c,d). Such liquid repellency ensures the
formation of nearly spherical droplets of nanoparticle suspension.

5 μL water and hexadecane droplets on the surface.

The change in droplet shape during the evaporation
process was
tracked with a side view camera (IDS uEye USB camera). After depositing
2 μL of TiO2–PS binary mixture (0.1 vol %
of nanoparticles, volume ratio of TiO2 to PS is 1:5) onto
the superamphiphobic surface, it takes about 24 min to evaporate the
water (22 °C at 40% relative humidity, Figure 2a). The suspension evaporated at a constant
contact angle without contact line pinning until the end of the process.
The droplet as well as the finally obtained supraparticle had a sphere-like
shape, in agreement with what has been observed before.36,39 Picknett and Bexon calculated the evaporation rate of water droplets
in still air, while assuming that diffusion of water molecules in
air is rate-limiting.40 They showed that
the volume V2/3 of a sessile droplet evaporating
at a constant contact angle decreases linearly with time as  Here, V0 is the
initial volume of the droplet and α is the evaporation speed.
In our experiment, a linear decrease of V2/3 was observed for both nanoparticle suspension and pure water droplets
(Figure S1). The evaporation speed in the
presence of nanoparticles in the droplet was similar (α = 972
± 10 μm2/s) to that of a pure water droplet
(α = 905 ± 8 μm2/s) evaporating under
the same conditions. This similar evaporation speed indicates that
no significant accumulating of nanoparticles at the interface occurs.

porous TiO2 supraparticles achieved after calcination.
Inset in (d) shows the whole porous supraparticle.

SEM images (Figure 2b inset) confirm the spherical morphology of the obtained
supraparticles.
Small TiO2 and large PS nanoparticles are randomly distributed
on the surface (Figures 2b and S2a). This is due to the size and
shape polydispersity of the TiO2 nanoparticles, which prevent
the formation of a crystalline-like structure. To further characterize
the distribution of building blocks in the microsphere, we cut the
binary supraparticles in half (with a WEDO leather knife) and imaged
the internal structure with SEM. Both colloids are homogeneously distributed
inside the supraparticle without a large degree of segregation (Figures 2c and S2b).

After removing the PS phase by calcination,
a highly porous superstructure
was formed (Figure 2d,e). The retained TiO2 supraparticles maintained the
spherical morphology and their size even after removing about 83%
(vol %) solid of the binary supraparticles (Figure 2d inset). Randomly distributed macropores
are formed on the surface of the supraparticle after removing PS (Figures 2d and S2c). By cutting the obtained TiO2 supraparticles in half the homogeneously distributed macropores
left by the PS particles are visible (Figures 2e and S2d). The
macropores inside supraparticles are mostly interconnected to each
other especially for the case of higher PS content (Figure S3). This interconnectivity is essential for applications
to allow reactants to diffuse into and out of the supraparticles.

Control of the Structure of Porous Supraparticles
The
final size of supraparticles can be precisely controlled by the initial
droplet volume and the concentration of the components in suspension.
First, we evaporated 2 μL of droplets with different volume
contents of nanoparticles (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, and 1%).
Second, we prepared supraparticles using the same volume ratio (0.1%)
but with different droplet volumes (0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 40, and
100 μL). The diameter of supraparticles prepared ranged from
70 to 900 μm (Figures S4 and S5).
Even larger particles can in principle be prepared. However, when
the diameter of the droplet approaches the capillary length (γ/gρ)1/2, the droplets are deformed to an
oblate shape by gravity (Figure S6). Here,
γ and ρ are the surface tension and density of the suspension
and g = 9.81 m/s2 is the standard acceleration
of free fall.

The porosity of supraparticles can be adjusted
in two ways: macro-pore size and volume ratio of the inorganic phase.
The macro-pore size is adjustable by controlling the diameter of PS
nanoparticles. As shown in Figure S7, interconnected
pores could be achieved by reducing the diameter of PS particles from
1.25 μm to 572 nm (Figure S7a–c) and 270 nm (Figure S7d–f) and
keeping the volume ratio of TiO2 to PS at 1:5. Macropores
are still formed on the surface and the inner part. The pore size
agreed with the PS nanoparticle size used in each case.

We also
modulated the porosity of porous supraparticles by regulating
the volume ratio of TiO2 to PS in nanoparticle suspension.
The volume ratio (R) was set to 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:7,
and 1:9. By SEM (Figure 3) we observed that the number and density of macropores correlate
with R. Likewise, the density of pores inside the
porous supraparticles also increased. The interlayer of TiO2 between macropores becomes thinner and thinner with increasing R. Without PS particles, mesopores are formed by the interstitial
space between the TiO2 nanoparticles. Since TiO2 nanoparticles tend to attract each other at short distance, they
do not form a crystalline close packing but a more porous packing.
When adding PS particles, macropores are formed. Interconnection of
macropores will occur if neighboring PS particles contact with each
other before the calcination process. Such contacts will become more
likely when the R of TiO2 to PS in the
nanoparticle suspension decreases. Table S1 shows the volume fraction of PS particles in the final supraparticles
as derived from supraparticle size and added amount of PS templates.
With R decreasing, PS particles in the binary supraparticles
reach but do not exceed a volume fraction of 49.4%. This volume fraction
corresponds to the minimum density of a jammed packing, indicating
that PS particles form such a jammed configuration during the drying
process. In such a minimal jammed packing configuration, each particle
should on average contact seven immediate neighbors, resulting in
a corresponding number of interconnections between macropores in the
final porous supraparticles.41,42 The lowest volume ratio
of TiO2 to PS we could reach was 1:9. This means even after
removing 90% of the solid phase in the binary supraparticles, the
remaining TiO2 still preserved the spherical morphology
of the supraparticles. The porosity of the final porous supraparticles
obtained in each case was calculated based on the initial TiO2 volume in the droplet and the size of the supraparticle.
Pure TiO2 (R = 1:0) supraparticles have
a porosity of 66%. With increasing of the PS volume ratio, the porosity
gradually increased to 74.8%, 83.4%, 89.5%, 91.6%, and 92.1%, respectively
(Figure S8). The porosity of the supraparticles
would be hard to measure directly, since typical experimental methods
such as gas sorption/desorption would fail for the combination of
micro- and macropores. However, since only the inorganic phase remains
after the calcination process, the porosity of supraparticles can
simply be calculated based on the TiO2 volume in the original
droplet and the diameter of the final TiO2 supraparticles.
These results demonstrate that the structural parameters of the porous
supraparticles, such as size, macropore size, and porosity, can be
easily determined by defining the evaporation conditions. Therefore,
preparation of highly porous supraparticles can be carried out in
a finely controllable manner.

Figure 3 SEM images for the surface of binary supraparticles
(1), the porous
surface (2) and inner structure (3) after calcination of supraparticles.
The volume ratios of TiO2 to PS equal 1:1 (a1, a2, a3),
1:3 (b1, b2, b3), 1:5 (c1, c2, c3), 1:7 (d1, d2, d3), and 1:9 (e1,
e2, e3), respectively; the diameter of PS particles was about 1.25
μm.

Binary superlattice thin films could be seen as
an alternative
approach to create highly porous materials with a comparable internal
microstructure. By using larger PS particles for the formation of
the lattice structure and filling of the voids with TiO2 nanoparticles, one could create inverse opals of TiO2 after calcination.43,44 In this case, the achievable
porosity would even be higher due to the closer packing of the PS
spheres. Tuning of the porosity in this case would be possible via variation of the size ratios of PS and TiO2 particles. Therefore, one would expect that the catalytic activity
of both systems should in principle be similar. The main advantages
of the supraparticles are (1) the simple way of fabrication (just
placing a droplet and letting it evaporate), (2) tuning of porosity
is more simple (no need for different PS particle sizes but just varying
concentration), and (3) the final product comes without supporting
substrate. This offers more flexibility in handling and application
scenarios. The supraparticles in dispersion are highly mobile and
can be easily transferred, concentrated, or diluted as required. The
size of the spherical supraparticles can range from a few tens of
micrometers to a few millimeters. Therefore, they can readily be adopted
in existing application systems (such as drug carriers and catalysts
in reaction vessels).

Mechanical Properties
To evaluate the potential benefit
of the highly porous supraparticles for practical applications, the
mechanical stability and photocatalytic activity were further investigated.
The fracture force of single supraparticles with different porosity
was measured with a home-built force-sensing system, which allowed
particle compression between two parallel glass plates equipped with
a force sensor and a stepper motor.45 For
the pure mesoporous TiO2 supraparticles without macropores,
the fracture force for a single particle was ∼175 mN (Figure S8). With the introduction of macropores,
the mechanical stability was significantly reduced. With increasing
porosity, the fracture force further decreased. For supraparticles
with a porosity higher than 85%, the fracture force decreased to about
4–5 mN. Even though these highly porous particles are more
fragile, even for the supraparticles with the largest porosity (92%),
the fracture force is still about 600 000 times larger than
the gravitational force (Figure S9). This
means that a densely packed bed of such particles could reach a height
of 76 m before the lowermost particles would start to break. Therefore,
even the supraparticles with the largest porosity prepared by our
method are stable enough for practical use.

Photocatalytic Efficiency
TiO2 is commonly
used as photocatalyst for degradation of organic dyes, splitting of
water, decontamination, photosynthesis, etc.46−49 Improvement in its photocatalytic activity without using chemical
modification is of great importance. The photodegradation performance
of the TiO2 supraparticles with different porosities was
investigated to evaluate the effect of macropores. Rhodamine B, a
typical organic dye, was chosen as a model compound for photocatalytic
degradation. The process was conducted by irradiation with UV-A light
(power: 0.3 ± 0.01 mW/cm2). As shown in Figure 4a, after 22 h of irradiation,
the organic dye in solution containing the largest porosity TiO2 supraparticles is nearly completely degraded (∼97%,
72% of the degradation was contributed by TiO2 supraparticles).
The photocatalytic activity of the porous supraparticles increased
with increasing porosity (Figure 4b,c). The photocatalytic activity of supraparticles
with the largest porosity reached about 2.7 times of that of mesoporous
supraparticles without macropores. We attribute the enhancement of
photocatalytic activity to the existence of macropores, making it
much easier for the organic dye to diffuse into supraparticles, increasing
the effectively available surface area for photocatalytic reaction.
For catalytic reactions, which do not depend on light, the effect
is probably even more pronounced. For photocatalysis, the inner part
of the supraparticles is not effective because light is absorbed in
the outer shell. These results show that the introduction of macropores
can improve the catalytic property of the supraparticles. Our method
is therefore a promising approach for the production of highly porous
supraparticles with enhanced properties in an environmentally friendly
manner.

As the approach presented here is mainly controlled
by the evaporation
of droplets on superamphiphobic surfaces, our method can easily be
adopted to fabricate highly porous supraparticles from other materials
in an environmental friendly manner. Figure 4d–f shows the highly porous binary
and ternary suprapaticles (TiO2–Au, ZnO–Au,
TiO2–ZnO-Au) fabricated by mixing two functional
materials or adding noble metal nanoparticles in the droplet. Again
we maintain spherical morphology and evenly distributed macropores
spanning a network from the surface to the inner core. Moreover, other
supraparticles, e.g., ZnO, SiO2, and TiO2–ZnO, can also be obtained by using the same method
(Figure S10). These results confirmed the
possibility of our approach for integrating multiple functions into
a single supraparticle for optimized applications.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricate highly porous
surpraparticles based
on evaporation of droplets of suspensions on superamphiphobic surfaces.
Taking advantage of the liquid repellency of the superamphiphobic
surface, we suppress contact line pinning during the evaporation,
leading to the formation of spherical multicomponent supraparticles
that can be easily released from the surface. To increase the porosity
of the supraparticles, we add sacrificial polymer nanoparticles. After
formation of supraparticles these polymer nanoparticles are burned
away to create interconnected pores. The structures of the obtained
porous supraparticles (particle size, pore size, porosity, and component
distribution) are finely adjustable by regulating droplet volume,
dispersion concentration, choice of primary particles, and sacrificial
particles. The flexibility of our approach has the potential to expand
applications of supraparticles in research areas such as absorber
materials in chromatography, heterogeneous catalysts, and drug carriers.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Methyltrichlorosilane (TCMS, 99%), TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, mixture of anatase and rutile), and hexadecane
(reagentPlus, 99%) were purchased from Aldrich. 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane
(PFDTS, 96%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar; n-hexane
(95%) from Fisher Chemical. Toluene, acetone, and ethanol absolute
were provided by VWR Chemicals. Ultrapure water with a resistivity
of 18.2 MΩ·cm was produced using a Sartorius Arium 611
VF water purification system. Glass slides of 26 × 76 mm2 in size were provided by Menzel-Gläser, Germany. Polystyrene
particles (negative charged, with a −COOH group on the surface)
with diameters of 270 nm, 572 nm, and 1.25 μm were prepared
using surfactant-free emulsion polymerization50 and purified by several cycles of centrifugation and redispersion
in ultrapure water.

Fabrication of a Silicone Nanofilaments Based Superamphiphobic
Surface
The superamphiphobic surfaces were prepared by the
grow-from method.37,38 Glass slides were first cleaned
with toluene, acetone, absolute ethanol under ultrasonication, and
dried by nitrogen flow. Then the substrates were treated with an oxygen
plasma (Diener Electronic Femto, 30 W for 2 min). Five activated glass
slides were immersed in 360 mL of toluene with 166 ppm water in a
reaction chamber. Subsequently, 250 μL of TCMS was added to
initiate the growth of silicone nanofilaments, and the chamber was
sealed. After 12 h of reaction, the silicone nanofilament-grafted
glass slides were rinsed with hexane and dried under a nitrogen flow.
To achieve superamphiphobicity, the substrate is modified with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane. For the modification of PFDTS, the
silicone nanofilaments were further activated with oxygen plasma (120
W for 2 min). Then the activated substrates were immersed in a mixture
of 180 μL of PFDTS and 120 mL of hexane for 30 min. After the
modification, the substrates were rinsed with hexane and dried under
nitrogen flow. The obtained nanofilament-coated glass was homogeneous
over a large area, and the micropores and overhangs formed by the
silicone fibers endowed the surface with its nonwettability. Water
droplets possess a static contact angle over 161° (Figure 1c) with a sliding angle of
about 4°, while hexadecane droplets have a contact angle around
156° (Figure 1d) with a sliding angle about 8° at a volume of 5 μL.

Preparation and Modulation of Hierarchical Porous TiO2 Supraparticles
Hierarchical porous TiO2 supraparticles
were prepared by calcination of TiO2/PS binary supraparticles
that were fabricated on a superamphiphobic surface. First, 2 μL
of binary mixture of TiO2 and PS particles with the concentration
equal to 0.1% (vol) were dropped onto a silicone nanofilament-based
superamphiphobic surface with the help of an Eppendorf Research Plus
pipet (equipped with epT.I.P.S. LoRetention Reloads tips). Then water
evaporated at 22 °C and relative humidity (RH) was equal to 40%.
The binary TiO2/PS supraparticles formed after evaporation
were released by slightly inclining and shaking. Supraparticles were
collected on a weighing paper and then transferred into a bottle vial.
The binary supraparticles are stable for collection and handling without
attrition. However, when immersing them in water, they tend to disintegrate,
since the particles are hydrophilic and there are no strong interactions
between TiO2 and PS. In some cases, trace amounts of the
nanofilaments were left behind at the supraparticle surface (Figure S11) since the nanofilaments may still
have a few hydrophilic points that can pin the contact line. The binary
TiO2/PS supraparticles were put into a muffle furnace and
calcinated at 500 °C for 3 h to remove the PS and form pure TiO2 supraparticles with hierarchical porosity. The final TiO2 supraparticles showed improved stability and did not disintegrate
when immersed in water. The final size of supraparticles could be
adjusted by the volume content of nanoparticles (range 0.1–1%)
and the initial volumes (0.3–100 μL). Meanwhile, the
porosity and the size of macropores can also be regulated with the
volume ratio of TiO2 to PS and the size of template PS.
It is worth noting that the transformation temperature of anatase
to rutile is around 500–800 °C. Choosing 500 °C for
calcination did not cause any detectable crystal transformation, while
complete removal of the organic component is ensured (Figure S12).

Photocatalytic Activity
To measure the photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 supraparticles, 2 mg of TiO2 SPs with different porosities were placed into 8 mL vials containing
a RhB solution (10 μg/mL, 5 mL) separately. The supraparticles
formed a monolayer on the bottom and did not shield each other. Then
the mixtures were radiated from the bottom side with a UV-A light
(UV source: LQ-400, Dr. Gröbel UV-Elektronik GmbH) for a certain
time at a power of 0.3 ± 0.01 mW/cm2. The photodegradation
process was conducted without stirring. As a control group, 5 mL of
RhB solution without TiO2 SPs and 5 mL of RhB solution
with 2 mg of pure TiO2 SPs without macroporous were irradiated
with the UV-A light under the same conditions.

Characterization
The morphology of the silicone nanofilaments
and supraparticles was imaged by scanning electron microscopy (low
voltage LEO 1530 Gemini, Germany). The samples were sputter-coated
with a 5 nm layer of Pt using a BalTec MED 020 modular high-vacuum
coating system prior to avoid charging. Static and sliding angles
of 5 μL water and hexadecane droplets on the nanofilament-based
superamphiphobic surface were measured with a goniometer, Dataphysics
OCA35 (Data Physics Instruments GmbH, Germany). UV–vis adsorption
spectra were taken from a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 UV–vis spectrometer
with Suprasil QS 1 mm cuvettes. The water concentration in toluene
was evaluated using a Karl Fischer coulometer (Mettler Toledo C20
Compact KF coulometer). Optical micrographs were taken by an optical
microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiotech Vario 100HD). TEM images of TiO2 nanoparticles with and without calcination were taken by
transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-1400). Powder XRD measurement
was performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE Twin X-ray diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation.
