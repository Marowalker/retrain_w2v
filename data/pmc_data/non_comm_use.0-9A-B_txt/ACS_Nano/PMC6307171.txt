Skin wound healing
is a major health care issue. While electric
stimulations have been known for decades to be effective for facilitating
skin wound recovery, practical applications are still largely limited
by the clumsy electrical systems. Here, we report an efficient electrical
bandage for accelerated skin wound healing. On the bandage, an alternating
discrete electric field is generated by a wearable nanogenerator by
converting mechanical displacement from skin movements into electricity.
Rat studies demonstrated rapid closure of a full-thickness rectangular
skin wound within 3 days as compared to 12 days of usual contraction-based
healing processes in rodents. From in vitro studies,
the accelerated skin wound healing was attributed to electric field-facilitated
fibroblast migration, proliferation, and transdifferentiation. This
self-powered electric-dressing modality could lead to a facile therapeutic
strategy for nonhealing skin wound treatment.

Nonhealing
skin wounds, such
as diabetic foot ulcers, venous-related ulcerations, and nonhealing
surgical wounds affect more than 6.5 million people in the United
States and result in enormous health care expenditures, with the total
cost estimated at more than $25 billion per year.1−4 In addition, slow- or nonhealing
skin wounds are morbid conditions that can result in long-term physical
and mental suffering due to the protracted treatment courses often
required by chronic wounds. The principal goal in skin wound management
is to achieve rapid wound closure. Treating skin wounds has been dated
to the very early stage of human civilization, e.g., by making plasters and bandaging the wounds.5 Owing to the large advancements of modern biomedicine and
medical technology, the last several decades have seen the evolution
of a number of more effective treatment strategies, including invasive
methods such as wound debridement6 and
noninvasive techniques such as compression bandaging,7 wound dressing,8,9 hyperbaric oxygen therapy,10 negative pressure therapy,11 ultrasound,12 and electrical
stimulation.13,14 Most of these methods are passive
treatments and rarely participate in controlling endogenous cell behaviors.
Currently, advanced growth factors-mediated therapy emerged as an
effective approach for regenerative skin wound healing, which still
faces the challenges of rapid degradation and loss of bioactivity.15,16 Electrical stimulation (ES) for wound healing is an attractive adjunct
to wound care. It imitates the natural wound-healing mechanism of
the endogenous electric field to facilitate skin growth. It has the
potential to treat many different types of acute and chronic skin
wounds with minimal adverse effects and good simplicity to apply.

The therapeutic effects of ES for wound healing were first observed
in the late 20th century.17,18 It is believed that
an electric field is essential for directing many cellular processes
that lead to orderly healing naturally.19,20 As summarized
in the literature,21 ES can decrease edema
around the electrode; lyse or liquify necrotic tissue; stimulate growth
of granulation tissue; increase blood flow; cause fibroblasts to proliferate
and make collagen; induce epidermal cell migration; attract neutrophils;
stimulate neurite growth directionally; promote epithelial growth
and organization; decrease mast cells in healing wounds; attract macrophages;
and stimulate receptor sites to accept certain growth factors. Although
the influence from an electric field can be significant, clinical
applications of electrical stimulation for wound healing typically
involves large-sized extracorporeal devices to provide appropriate
electrical fields and may require patient hospitalization.

The
recent innovation of nanogenerator (NG) technology opened a
route for generating periodic biphasic electric pulses by locally
converting mechanical displacements, such as body or muscle motions.22−27 This exceptional capability makes NG a candidate for producing electrical
stimulations that is self-sustainable and biologically responsive.
Besides, NGs could be made flexible with reasonably high output power
density and energy conversion efficiency. Their multiple energy conversion
mechanisms, including both piezoelectric and triboelectric effects,
allow a wide selection of materials and multiple designs principles.
Furthermore, typical NGs have been proved fairly stable against environmental
conditions like temperature28 and humidity29,30 within the range of normal biological systems. Therefore, NG may
bring opportunities for electrical stimulation-based medical treatments.
In this work, we report a significantly accelerated skin wound recovery
under the influence of small electrical pulses produced by a wearable
NG device. The wound-healing time on rat’s dorsal skin was
reduced from 12 days to less than 3 days by this treatment, which
was superior to most other reported wound recovery strategies. The
outstanding effectiveness of the self-activated electrotherapy was
attributed to electric field-facilitated fibroblast migration, proliferation,
and transdifferentiation.

Results and Discussion
The self-activated
electrotherapy bandage device consisted of two
parts: the biomechanical energy conversion part (i.e., NG) and the dressing electrodes. As shown in Figure 1a, the NG was made
by overlapping the Cu/PTFE (electronegative material) layer with another
Cu (electropositive material) layer on different sides of the polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) substrate. The PTFE layer can slide back and forth
relative to the Cu layer. Owing to the good flexibility of PTFE (Young’s
Modulus is 0.5 GPa), the multilayer device (PET–Cu foil–PTFE)
showed a much lower bending modulus compared to pure PET films (Figure 1b), demonstrating
good adaptability to soft skin surface. This NG design worked appropriately
under regular sliding conditions, and its voltage, current, and power
output under different load resistance are included in the Supporting
Information (Figure S2). The toxicity of
the bandage was evaluated by measuring the cell viability of 3T3 fibroblasts
cultured on PTFE and PET surfaces using the MTT assay.31 Results up to 72 h showed that both PET and
PTEF surfaces had negligible impacts on the cell viability (Figure 1c), meaning they
are safe to be applied to the wounds.

The overlapping area change would
drive charge flow toward or away
from the two dressing electrodes and, thus, induce an electric potential
in between them (schematically shown in Figure S1). Such a small sliding displacement could be achieved by
wrapping the device around the chest area of a Sprague–Dawley
(SD) rat (inset of Figure 1d). The voltage generated between the dressing electrodes
was monitored under different stages of the rat’s activity
(Figure 1e). Regular
discrete voltage spikes were recorded, confirming a feasible continuous
electrical stimulation driven by breath. When the rat was under deep
anesthesia, the peak-to-peak voltage amplitude (Vpp) was only ∼0.2 V at a rate of 30 per min, corresponding
to the slow and shallow breathing pattern. After the rat was recovering
from the influence of isoflurane, Vpp reached
∼1.3 V at a rate of 40 per min. This corresponds to a calm
and steady status of the rat. As the rat returned to its normal activity,
a stronger and more rapid breath was enabled. Accordingly, Vpp reached the highest level of ∼2.2
V at a rate of 110 per min. This initial test showed that the electric
potential between the dressing electrode was strongly correlated to
the breathing behavior. Since our recovery experiments were performed
over days, the electric field may vary according to different daily
activity of the rats.

The initial test included two linear wounds
(1 cm long) made on
the back of an anaesthetized rat (Figure 1f). The electrical stimulation device (left)
and a dummy device (right) were wrapped around the body with the dressing
electrodes facing the wounds. The accelerated wound recovery by the
self-activated electrotherapy was hypothesized based on the endogenous
electric field effect on wound site recovery. As schematically shown
in Figure 1g, at the
wounded area, the disruption of transepithelial potential (TEP) induces
the endogenous electric field that has been previously identified
as the signal for epithelial cells to initiate directional migration
into the dermal wound bed.32 This potential
is maintained until the skin regeneration process is completed. In
our design, the two dressing electrodes placed on each side of the
wound, serve to generate an electric field that could penetrate into
the dermis, and strengthen the endogenous electric field for enhanced
wound healing.

The influence of the discrete, weak electric
field in wound healing
was first tested on linear wounds with a pair of comb-shaped dressing
electrodes. As shown in Figure 2a, the dressing electrodes were placed on the proximal skin
wound (top of image) by aligning the linear wound with the middle
gap in between the electrode pair, where the electric field was perpendicular
to the wound direction. A direct comparison as a control using the
same set of dressing electrodes that were disconnected from the NG
electrodes was implemented on the distal wound (bottom of image).
Thus, no electric field was present in the control wound, but all
other conditions were comparable. Additional control experiments were
performed on the same type of wounds with just the gold electrodes
(Figure S3a) and with a blank PET material
(Figure S3c). Finite element analysis (FEA)
showed that a strong and localized electric field was created between
the electrode teeth (Figure 2b). For a normal Vpp of 1 V, the
electric field could reach 10 V/cm, indicating the feasibility of
realizing a broad range of electric field strength via proper electrode
designs. Furthermore, the electric field strength outside of the electrode
coverage dropped quickly to a negligible value as compared to the
high value in between, suggesting the electric field should have minimal
impacts to the surrounding tissue or organs. Cross-sectional image
of the electric field distribution showed that a reasonably large
electric field existed beneath the skin surface (Figure 2c).

field (EF). (a) Digital image of experimental group (with electrode

and NG) attached on the wound of rat. (b) Front and (c) lateral view

Enlarged images of the wound areas from (d).

After the rats wore the devices for 2 days under normal activity,
the wounds were examined and compared (Figure 2d). The electrode-covered region in the experimental
groups showed a nearly complete recovery (Figure 2e). Small dots with slightly darker color
could be observed from the wounded zone, corresponding to the electrode
teeth distribution. Along the same wound, the uncovered area was still
not fully healed. A similar unhealed wound surface was observed from
all of the control wounds (with disconnected Au electrodes and blank
control groups) in all rat models (Figure 2f and Figure S3b,d, three groups and n = 3 in each group). These observations
suggest that the electric fields generated by the NG could facilitate
the recovery of linear skin wounds on rats. Post experimental examination
also revealed that the dressing electrodes remained intact after 3
days of operation, confirming their excellent stability when attached
to the skin surface (Figure S4).

To further understand the influence of an electric field, interdigitated
dressing electrodes were implemented for wound healing (Figure S5). In this setup, the linear wound was
aligned perpendicular to the electrode pairs; therefore, the electric
field was parallel to the wound direction. While the strength of electric
field was comparable to the original test, no obvious difference was
observed in wound healing by comparing the experimental and control
groups, indicating that the electric field direction was an important
factor for wound healing.

Nevertheless, linear acute skin wounds
often heal fairly fast,
and their closure rate cannot be reliably quantified. Therefore, the
self-stimulated wound healing was further explored on full-thickness
rectangular skin wounds using a pair of parallel line electrodes.
First, the electric filed strength influences were investigated by
using a parallel set of electrode pairs with their electrode gaps
varied from 0.8 to 2.2 cm on full thickness square wounds (around
0.4 cm × 0.4 cm) (Figure S6). In general,
a higher healing rate was obtained from higher electric field strength.
To ensure a reasonable healing rate and moderate applied electric
field strength, ∼ 250 V/m electric field strength was used
in the following quantitative wound-healing studies.

As shown
in Figure 3a-i, the
proximal wound (top of image) was aligned in between the
two vertical line electrodes and the electric field was along the
horizontal direction. The distal wound (bottom of image) was covered
by the same electrode setup but without an electric field as a control.
After 3 days, the wound exposed to an electric field exhibited improved
wound closure (Figure 3a-ii). Conversely, the control wound was still open with nonorderly
wound healing consistent with contraction. This phenomenon further
confirmed that the small discrete electric field generated by NG was
able to direct and facilitate the wound recovery along the direction
of the electric field. Without the electric field, large-area wounds
show a radial healing direction due to contraction with a much slower
rate, which was driven by the endogenous electric field (Figure S7). To further analyze the microscopic
wound-healing characteristics of the electric field, after 2 days
of treatment, the tissues were harvested, sectioned, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (Figure 3b). The treated skin exhibited a completely healed wound with
normal appearing epithelialization, while the control skin exhibited
granulation tissue at the site of the wound, lacking epithelialization
over the wounded area.

example of H&E stained sections of the center of a wound after

(red curve) and without (black curve) electric field stimulation (n = 3).

Following the accelerated
wound healing observed on rat’s
skin, rectangular wounds were then used to quantify the wound closure
rate driven by the discrete NG electric field. The series of images
taken during the healing process (Figure 3c) clearly demonstrates that under a discrete
parallel electric field the experimental wound (upper wound in each
image) healed much faster than the control wound (lower wound in each
image). The wound was completely closed along the electric field direction
within 72 h; meanwhile, the control wound still had 46% wound area
remaining open. It took ∼10–12 days for the control
wounds and the untouched wounds (Figure S7) to recover to the same level, which was comparable to other reported
wound-healing behavior in loose-skinned animals, such as mouse, rat,
and rabbit.9 It should be noted that loose
skinned animals heal their wounds mostly by contraction in contrast
to humans whose wounds heal mostly by re-epithelialization.33 Recognizing this difference, future more clinical-relevant
studies will need to shift to swine and human skin models.

From
the series of images, the NG-facilitated wound recovery behavior
was quantified (i.e., change in normalized wound
area as a function of time). As shown in Figure 3d, in the presence of NG electric fields,
the wound area (red triangles) reduced rapidly and reached a nearly
complete closure (94% ± 4.3%, three groups and n = 3 in each group) within the first 48 h (the healing process is
shown in Figure S8). Without the electric
field, the wounds exhibited a normal wound contraction behavior, where
the wound area slowly reduced to 30% within the first 150 h (black
dots). The rate of healing declined as the wounds reached full closure.
The NG-accelerated wound-healing behavior was then compared to other
reported representative treatment strategies. Other representative
wound treatment strategies, such as stem cell therapy (Vehicle-M,
FB-M, and MSC-M),34,35 nanomaterial dressing therapy
(ZnO, CS, CS-ZnO-0.5, and CS-Ag/ZnO-0.5),36 and laser therapy (4 and 8 J/cm2),37 all exhibited a closure time of more than 7 days for similar
wounds on rat skins (a detailed comparison is included in Figure S9). It can be seen that our strategy
provided a very short wound closure time (3 days), supporting the
excellent wound-healing behavior enabled by the discrete NG electric
fields.

To understand the mechanism of the accelerated wound-healing
behavior,
fibroblast cell growth under the same electrical stimulation was studied in vitro. It is known that fibroblasts play a vital role
in the highly coordinated biological process of dermal wound healing.38,39 In the early stage of wound healing, fibroblasts migrate to the
wound area, proliferate, and interact with surrounding cells (keratinocytes,
fat cells and mast cells). Afterward, fibroblasts differentiate and
produce extracellular matrix (ECM), glycoproteins, adhesive molecules
and various cytokines. The generated collagen-based ECM then replaces
the provisional fibrin-based matrix and helps reapproximate wound
edges through their contractile properties.

First, the proliferation
of fibroblast cells was studied by comparing
the cell viability cultured with and without the NG electric filed.
As schematically shown in Figure 4a, fibroblast cells were in a 96-well plate. A NG electric
field (4 V/cm, Figure S10) was applied
to the seventh column via a pair of line electrodes
(as marked by the gold dashed lines). After 72 h of culture, cell
viability in different columns was measured by the MTT assay. The
first, second, and twelfth columns were used as controls since they
were the farthest from the electric field, and their viability was
considered as 100%. The viability of the third, fifth, seventh, ninth,
and eleventh column was measured and shown in the plot. Column 7 (the
electrical dressing group) showed the highest cell viability of 127%
± 14.37%, and columns 5 and 9 showed lower values of 112% ±
18.73% and 113% ± 16.43%, respectively (n =
8). The distributed >100% viability revealed a possible correlation
between the strength of electric field and the cell viability.

(e) ROS results of blank control (BC), AC (alternating electric field

Furthermore, the migration and assembly of fibroblast cells
was
investigated in a single culturing dish under the influence of the
NG electric field. As schematically shown in Figure 4b, a pair of Au electrodes (0.5 cm spaced)
were placed against the dish wall in parallel. After cells adhered
to the dish, electrodes of experimental group were connected to the
NG to produce a 2 V/cm electric field within the dish at a frequency
of 1 Hz. Microscopic photographs were taken every 2 h and are shown
in Figure 4c (the control
group and the experimental group). The fibroblasts in the control
group exhibited little noticeable change within the first 12 h (Figure 4c-i to 4c-iv). However,
the one with an NG electric field started to show linear alignment
within 2 h (Figure 4c-i′). After 4 h, fibroblasts exhibited a rapid proliferation
and aligned well into multiple parallel lines (Figure 4c-ii′). As the electric field stimulation
proceeded for more than 6 h, fibroblasts continued to proliferate
and differentiate along the lines of the electric field (Figure 4c-iii′ and
-iv′). This observation suggested that the electric field may
facilitate the fibroblasts differentiating into myofibroblasts, thus
providing a contraction force for wound closure.

Western blot
analysis was further used to investigate the potential
influences of the NG electric field to three typical growth factors
involved in wound healing, including transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β),40 epidermal growth factor
(EGF),41 and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF). As shown in Figure 4d, TGF-β, EGF, and VEGF all showed an enhanced
expression in NG-stimulated tissues as compared to the control groups.
In particular, the EGF expression exhibited a statistically significant
enhancement (P = 0.0085), which is related to increasing
proliferation and phenotypic expression of keratinocytes.41 This analysis suggested that the improved cell
proliferation could be a result of the raised level of growth factors
stimulated by NG electric field.

It is noteworthy to point out
that for electric fields, typically
high-amplitude and/or high frequency electrical pulses have been used
and studied as a wound recovery strategy, whereas the effect was not
ideal because intensive exposure to electric fields might induce certain
side effects.42−44 To distinguish the effect from the discrete NG electric
field from traditional alternating current (AC) electrical stimulation,
we tested the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount generated
with high glucose modified Eagle medium (DMEM) that was stimulated
by an NG (Figure S11a) or a function generator
(Figure S11b), along with a blank control.
The peak-to-peak voltage generated by NG (Figure S11c) and the function generator (Figure S11d) were nearly the same, which means the electric field
applied to the testing area was the same. As summarized in Figure 4e, the NG groups
exhibited a higher ROS level (by 65%) as compared to the blank control
groups (BC), whereas the function generator group (AC) showed a dramatically
increased ROS level that was 489 ± 29% and 424 ± 23% (n = 5) higher than that of BC and NG groups, respectively.
The significantly higher ROS level induced by normal AC signal would
be harmful to the biological system or even cause cell death.45 The advantageous results from the NG pulses
could be attributed to the natural mechanism of its voltage generation
mechanism, which is determined by the limited number of surface charges
rather than infinite amount of charge provided by the signal generator
to maintain design voltage profile.

Conclusion
In
summary, we demonstrated a highly efficient wound recovery strategy
based on a wearable NG device. The device can locally convert the
kinetic energy generated from a rat breathing into a discrete AC voltage
signal and apply the electric field directly on the wound to enhance
skin regeneration. Animal studies demonstrated a rapid closure of
full-thickness rectangular skin wound within 3 days as compared to
12 days of normal healing process. In vitro data
showed that the therapeutic effects were attributed to the electric
field which promotes fibroblast migration, proliferation, and transdifferentiation.
Moreover, the NG-based bandage produced a safe and very low-level
electricity over the wounds, which is favorable for lowering the level
of discomfort or pain. This self-stimulated electrotherapy for wound
healing could have an impact on other related diseases (e.g., Raynaud’s disease) and may resolve cosmetic concerns, such
as chickenpox scars, acne, keloid scarring, or rosacea. Better understanding
and optimization of this physical treatment strategy will impact multidisciplinary
research directions including surgical, biochemical, and translational
sciences and eventually bring an effective therapeutic strategy to
chronic disease treatment.

Experimental Section
Fabrication
and Characterization of NG-Based Self-Activated
Bandage
A PET (CS Hyde Co.) film (22 cm × 1.2 cm ×
75 μm) film was used as the substrate, and two pieces of Cu
foil (10 cm× 1.2 cm × 25 μm) were attached to both
sides of PET substrate as the NG electrodes. A PTEF (CS Hyde Co.)
film (10 cm × 1.2 cm× 25 μm) was attached to the top
of one Cu electrode as the triboelectric active layer. Working electrodes
(Au 50 nm and Cr 10 nm) for electrical stimulation were deposited
on the PET substrate by E-beam Evaporation (CHA-600). A dummy device
for control experiment was fabricated using the same design and procedure,
but only with the working electrodes disconnected from the NG electrodes.
For performance characterization, the PET film was tied around the
rat’s torso. The voltage outputs were recorded between the
two working electrodes using an Agilent DSO1012A oscilloscope (1 MΩ
internal resistance) when the rat was under anesthesia, calm, and
with normal activity. The bendability of PET film, PET film with Cu
foil, and bandage was tested with a dynamic mechanical analyzer RSA
III.

Wound Recovery Experiments
All animal experiments were
conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult Sprague–Dawley
(SD) rats (300g) were used for wound-healing experiments (all experiments
were repeated using three groups of SD rats, n =
3 in each group). Anesthesia was first induced by inhalation of 2–5%
isoflurane and maintained with 2% isoflurane. After anesthesia, rats
were fixed in a prone position, and the dorsum was shaved and cleaned
with alcohol. Two full thickness excisional linear (1 cm) or rectangular
wounds (0.8 cm × 0.8 cm) were created along the shaved back of
each rat. The self-activated bandage was wrapped around the rat, and
the wound areas were covered with working electrodes. The control
experiments were set on the adjacent area with the same type of wounds
covered by the dummy device or blank substrates. Bioglue (CryoLife,
Inc.) was used to adhere the bandages to the rats’ skin 0.5–1
cm away from the wound. A cotton net (3 M Health Care, St. Paul, MN)
was used to fix the device. Wound healing was quantified by measuring
remaining wound area using ImageJ. Wounds were considered completely
closed if moist granulation tissue was no longer apparent and the
wounded area was covered with epithelium.

After the final tracing,
rats were euthanized and the entire wound area, including ∼5
mm of the adjacent normal skin, was excised down to the fascia and
removed. The wound was divided in half and placed in Bouin’s
fixative overnight. The wounds were then bisected down the center
for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Representative
sections from treatment and control tissues were imaged using a Nikon
Ti–S inverted microscope and digital images were captured with
Nikon DS Ri2 cooled color camera, X-Cite 120LED BOOST System lamp
from Excelitas, and Nikon Imaging Software, NIS Elements (Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan). Bright field images of H&E were taken at 40× magnification.

MTT Assay
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (HUVECs, CAMBREX) were
cultured in a complete growth media that comprised high glucose modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) with l-glutamine, supplemented with 15%
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells
were seeded into 96-well culture plates, maintained at 37 °C
in a humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2, and
the culture medium was changed every day. The seventh column of the
96-well culture plate was applied a voltage generated by NG, and the
first, second, and twelfth columns were used as controls. After 72
h, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay (ThermoFisher Scientific) was
performed to examine cell viability. MTT solution (100 μL) was
added to each well. After 4 h of incubation, the medium was removed,
and DMSO (500 μL/well) was added to dissolve the precipitated
fomazan. The optical density (n = 3) of the solution
was evaluated using a microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength
of 490 nm.

Cell Morphology under Electric Field
NIH 3T3 cells
were cultured in 30 × 10 mm cell culture dishes (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) with activated (experimental) and inactivated (control)
Au electrodes (1 cm × 0.1 cm) placed against the dish wall. For
cell culture under electric stimulation from NG, the Au electrodes
were connected to contact-separate NG which was driven by a linear
motor controlled through computer at a frequency of 1 Hz. For cell
culture under electric stimulation from function generator, the Au
electrodes were connected to function generator which output voltage
with the same amplitude and frequency as NG. For control group, no
electric stimulation was applied for cell culture. Cell morphology
was observed periodically using an inverted optical microscope (Nikon
Eclipse Ti–U, Japan).

Reactive Oxygen Species Analysis
Three 30 × 10
mm cell culture dishes with Au electrodes (1 cm × 0.1 cm) placed
against the dish wall were utilized. A 2.5 mL portion of high glucose
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with l-glutamine with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was add to each dish.
For the ROS test under electric stimulation from NG, the Au electrodes
were connected to contact-separate NG which was driven by a linear
motor controlled through computer at a frequency of 1 Hz. For ROS
under electric stimulation from function generator, the Au electrodes
were connected to function generator which output voltage with same
amplitude and same frequency as NG. For the control group, no electric
stimulation was applied. ROS concentrations were measured using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes). A 0.2 mL portion of solution
was taken out from each dish every 30 min and was mixed with 2 μL
of H2DCFDA (5 mg/mL) DMSO solution. The mixture was incubated for
30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity (Excitation:504 nm/Emission:
529 nm) was measured in a microplate reader (ClarioStar Plate Reader).

Western Blot Analysis
Skin tissues were harvested from
the mice of nanogenerator-treated or control group at day 2. The tissue
samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts) added
with proteinase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) by using a Dounce homogenizer
on the ice for 10–15 min. Then the supernatants were obtained
by centrifugation at 20000g for 20 min and measured
by a nanodrop reader (Thermo Scientific). Western blot analysis was
performed by using 4–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel (Invitrogen) and iBlot 2 Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). The
PVDF membrane carrying the samples were probed by using the antibodies
against VEGF (Thermo Scientific), EGF, TGF-β (R&D), and
β-actin (Li-Cor) at 4 °C overnight and then detected by
fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) for 1 h at room
temperature. Finally, the blots were obtained via the Odyssey imaging
system.
