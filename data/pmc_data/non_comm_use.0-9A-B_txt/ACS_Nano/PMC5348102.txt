The
bacterial Shiga toxin interacts with its cellular receptor,
the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3 or CD77), as a first
step to entering target cells. Previous studies have shown that toxin
molecules cluster on the plasma membrane, despite the apparent lack
of direct interactions between them. The precise mechanism by which
this clustering occurs remains poorly defined. Here, we used vesicle
and cell systems and computer simulations to show that line tension
due to curvature, height, or compositional mismatch, and lipid or
solvent depletion cannot drive the clustering of Shiga toxin molecules.
By contrast, in coarse-grained computer simulations, a correlation
was found between clustering and toxin nanoparticle-driven suppression
of membrane fluctuations, and experimentally we observed that clustering
required the toxin molecules to be tightly bound to the membrane surface.
The most likely interpretation of these findings is that a membrane
fluctuation-induced force generates an effective attraction between
toxin molecules. Such force would be of similar strength to the electrostatic
force at separations around 1 nm, remain strong at distances up to
the size of toxin molecules (several nanometers), and persist even
beyond. This force is predicted to operate between manufactured nanoparticles
providing they are sufficiently rigid and tightly bound to the plasma
membrane, thereby suggesting a route for the targeting of nanoparticles
to cells for biomedical applications.

==== Body
The bacterial
Shiga-like toxins
from Escherichia coli are responsible for pathological
manifestations that can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, an endemic
threat to human health.1 These toxins are
composed of 2 subunits: a catalytic A-subunit, which modifies rRNA
once translocated to the cytosol of target cells, leading to protein
biosynthesis inhibition;2 and a homopentameric
B-subunit, which mediates the toxin’s interaction with glycosphingolipids
(GSLs) from the globoseries, which function as cellular toxin receptors.

The cell biology of the parental Shiga toxin from Shigella
dysenteriae has been particularly well-studied.2,3 Its B-subunit (STxB), a rigid protein of around 7 nm in diameter,
tightly binds up to 15 globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) GSL receptor molecules
as the first step leading to toxin entry into cells.2 Current understanding suggests that the Shiga toxin-driven
reorganization of membrane lipids endows the toxin–Gb3 complexes
with curvature active properties that after clustering of toxin molecules
enables the formation of endocytic membrane invaginations without
a strict requirement for the cytosolic clathrin machinery (for a review,
see Johannes et al.4). After endocytosis,
Shiga toxin is then transported from early endosomes to the Golgi
apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, from where the catalytic
A-subunit is translocated to the cytosol to modify rRNA and thereby
to inhibit protein biosynthesis.5

Shiga toxin forms clusters on cell and model membranes despite
the apparent absence of direct protein–protein interaction
between toxin molecules based on hydrophobic or electrostatic effects,
or mechanisms based on cholesterol-dependent phase separation.6 How this clustering occurs is still unknown.
Possible mechanisms for membrane-associated particle clustering are
based on acto-myosin-driven molecular focusing, which would operate
at length scales in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers,7,8 and membrane-mediated forces in which the particles perturb the
membrane in a way that drives their aggregation. Such membrane-mediated
forces include capillary (domain boundary) forces, which only arise
under specific conditions, or lipid depletion forces, which are effective
only in the subnanometric range.9,10 Membrane perturbations
may also arise from generic properties of the particles, such as their
size or shape, and have been studied by computer simulation. Transmembrane
proteins whose height is mismatched with the width of the surrounding
membrane have also been found to aggregate if they are sufficiently
large.11 Similarly, highly curved nanoparticles,
but not shallow ones,12 adsorbed to a membrane
also aggregate and, subsequently, cause it to invaginate.13

Here, we have used computer simulations
to explore the clustering
of STxB molecules and compared their predictions to fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) experiments on model membranes and live cells.
We find that conventional membrane-mediated forces cannot explain
the observed STxB clustering. Indeed, well-explored mechanisms such
as lipid-chain length mismatch and compositional mismatch between
the local membrane environment near the toxin particles and the bulk
membrane were not required for STxB clustering. Nor was the hydrophobic
core of the membrane affected by bound STxB. Furthermore, using atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations, we recently obtained evidence that
suggests that membrane-bound STxB creates a small increment of curvature,14 which would be expected to yield a repulsive
force between toxin molecules.12,15 However, our simulations
and experiments show that reducing the rigidity of the bound STxB
nanoparticles or displacing them from the membrane surface eliminates
the clustering process. Strikingly, this effect is paralleled by a
loss of STxB nanoparticle-mediated suppression of membrane fluctuations,
strongly suggesting that fluctuation-induced forces generate an effective
attraction between the STxB nanoparticles. This clustering mechanism
is generic and should operate between any sufficiently
rigid nanoparticles that are able to bind tightly to a fluid phase
lipid bilayer, pointing to a route for the therapeutic delivery of
nanoparticles into cells.

Results
FCS Setup To Measure STxB
Clustering
Membrane-bound
STxB was studied in a micropipette aspiration setup that provides
control over membrane tension in a model membrane system, giant unilamellar
vesicles (GUVs), while simultaneously allowing the analysis of clustering
of membrane constituents by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
(FCS) (Figure 1A).
GUVs (95 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC)) were prepared by electroformation16 with 5 mol % of a natural long chain Gb3 species, C22:1, which has
previously been shown to favor STxB-driven membrane bending.6 Stretching the membrane to high values of approximately
10–3 N/m provided us with two advantages in precisely
testing the extent of STxB clustering. First, STxB-induced formation
of tubular membrane invaginations was prevented, which allowed us
to compare the different lipid species used in our experiments, independent
of their ability to support tubulation. Second, stretching the membrane
suppressed high amplitude membrane fluctuations that would otherwise
have resulted in non-STxB diffusion related intensity fluctuations
in the FCS measurements. Thereby, the fluorescence intensity fluctuations
observed in our experiments were predominantly due to diffusion of
STxB-Alexa488 molecules in and out of the cross section of the membrane
within the focal FCS observation spot. Diffusion time distributions
were measured by fitting the autocorrelation curves using the maximum
entropy method-based fitting routine (MEMFCS).17 This allowed us to deduce the size distribution of the
diffusing STxB clusters independent of the dimensionality of the equation
used in the fitting process (Supporting Information, Figure SI15) and the photophysics of the dye (Supporting Information, Figure SI16). We found that the peak
of the distribution of the diffusion times shifts with time to higher
values and the distribution broadens (expressed as τD in Figure 1C,D).
These observations suggest that the peak size of the STxB clusters
as well as the size heterogeneity grew with time.

species.

Line Tension Is Not Required
for STxB Clustering
Next
we exploited the above experimental setup to test whether commonly
understood membrane-mediated forces can explain STxB clustering.

Lipid chain length mismatch can be very effective for driving lipid
phase segregation. By creating a locally distinct lipid phase environment,
STxB could aggregate through a capillary effect.9 This possibility was addressed in our setup by using C18:1
Gb3 species whose chain length matched that of the bulk membrane lipid
DOPC. Even under these conditions, STxB still clustered efficiently
(Figure 1D), demonstrating
that lipid chain length mismatch is not strictly required.

Compositional
mismatch is another mechanism for line-tension driven
clustering. We therefore tested GUVs with a bulk Gb3 concentration
of 30 mol %, mimicking the estimated Gb3 concentration bound under
STxB molecules14 (see Supporting Information for further details). STxB still formed
invaginations at 37 °C, above the phase transition temperature
for 30% Gb3 and 70% DOPC (Figure 1B), indicating that clustering is maintained and that
lipid compositional mismatch is not required. These results lead us
to conclude that conventional line tension-based mechanisms are not
an obligatory requirement for STxB clustering.

No Impact of STxB on the
Hydrophobic Bulk of the Bilayer
Since STxB, via its receptor,
Gb3, is connected to the hydrophobic
region of the bilayer, one might suspect that the bound proteins modify
the lipid chain entropy thereby driving their clustering. To address
this possibility, we reanalyzed trajectories from our previously published
work14,18 and observed no major differences in the
lipid chain order parameter (Supporting Information, Figure SI10) nor the rotational correlation function of DOPC lipids
under STxB (Supporting Information, Figure
SI11), when compared to DOPC lipids far from STxB. Also, when the
chain order parameter of Gb3 bound to STxB was compared to that of
unbound Gb3, no evidence for STxB-induced ordering could be observed
(see Supporting Information, Figure SI12).
Therefore, an entropic effect of STxB on the hydrophobic region of
the bilayer as a source of clustering appears highly unlikely.

Local
Curvature Induced by STxB Does Not Drive Clustering
Shiga
toxin induces negative local membrane curvature, since it
results in macroscopic membrane invagination on GUVs (see Römer
et al.6) and membrane bending in
silico.(14) The question thus arises
whether such a curvature imprint can generate an attractive force.
Indeed, for highly curved particles, an attractive curvature-induced
force has been described previously.13 Later,
the same authors performed a more precise evaluation of the range
of the curvature imprint for which the curvature-induced force is
attractive.12 Notably, it was found that
for contact angles up to 45°, the curvature-induced force is
described well by the linear approximation and is predicted to be
repulsive.12,15 STxB clearly falls into this
category with a low contact angle around 7°, resulting from a
spontaneous curvature radius that is 5-fold bigger than the protein’s
size.14 We can therefore exclude induced
membrane curvature as the driving force for STxB clustering.

Coarse-Grained
Simulations of Clustering
The experimental
results so far suggest that the clustering of STxB molecules is independent
of the precise molecular structure of the membrane, and cannot be
explained by known membrane-mediated clustering mechanisms. To proceed
further, we used a coarse-grained simulation technique, dissipative
particle dynamics (DPD), to study the clustering of nanoparticles
(NP) that mimic the physical properties (but not the molecular details)
of Shiga toxin on an amphiphilic bilayer.

Previous studies have
shown that DPD simulations of lipid bilayers faithfully reproduce
membrane physical properties, such as area per lipid and membrane
elasticity for single19 and multicomponent
bilayers.20,21 After confirming that our simulations replicated
these properties (not shown), we added nanoparticles to the simulation
whose shape (pentagonal), size (7 nm cross-sectional size), and material
properties (high stiffness) mimic those of STxB. The detailed procedure
is described in the Supporting Information, including how NP stiffness is quantified by a “rigidity
parameter” k. The STxB binding to Gb3 was
modeled as a nonspecific attraction between the lipid head groups
and the nanoparticles. The simulated STxB nanoparticles are large
enough that atomic features of their binding, including H-bonding,
need not be explicitly represented, which makes DPD a suitable simulation
technique. Our results are therefore robust against the details of
the force field used and depend only on generic properties of the
particles that are independent of their detailed molecular structure.
We eliminated the possibility that clusters arise from direct binding
between nanoparticles by giving them a short-range (smaller than the
particle radius) repulsive interfacial interaction.
Furthermore, height and compositional mismatch and curvature were
excluded by choosing conditions in which, respectively, all lipid
tails are of the same length, the NPs are flat, and the same molecular
lipid species are used throughout (Supporting Information, Figure SI8B,C).

The DPD simulations showed
(see Supporting Information, Movie 1) that two rigid toxin NPs initially placed
apart on the membrane approached each other whereupon they adhered
dependent on the stiffness and the size of the toxin NPs, as described
below. Repeated simulations confirmed that, once bound, NPs did not
separate for at least 9.6 μs (Figure 2A, r = 8r0 condition, blue trace/box where r0 is the unit of length in the DPD simulations and is defined
in the Supporting Information). For comparison,
the NPs diffuse a distance equal to their diameter in approximately
10 μs (Supporting Information, Figure
SI8-A) indicating that the toxin NPs have overcome the entropic separation
tendency and adhere. Strikingly, toxin NPs dampened the membrane’s
thermal fluctuations in our DPD simulations (Supporting Information, Figure SI7A, k = 64, blue dot;
Figure SI7B for lipid L-02; see Supporting Information for details on the method to calculate the suppression of membrane
fluctuations). This effect on fluctuations will be followed up throughout
all subsequent experiments and its relevance to the clustering process
addressed in the Discussion.

flexible linker lengths.

Why Do Not All Proteins Cluster?
The above clustering
mechanism might be thought to operate among all membrane-associated
proteins, which would contradict the experimental observation that
many membrane proteins do not cluster.22−24 The clustering mechanism
must therefore depend on properties that are not shared by all membrane
proteins but that are present when the NPs in the DPD simulations
bind to the membrane, for example, NP size, geometry, stiffness, and
coupling to the membrane.

In a first set of simulations, we
found that NPs with sizes similar to that of the NP from Supporting Information, Movie 1, but with different
geometries (square, hexagonal, and disk-like), aggregated on tense
or tensionless bilayers (not shown). These results demonstrate that
the membrane tension and NP shape do not remove the clustering although
the force may be altered. By contrast, we found that clustering disappeared
when the nanoparticle diameter was less than about 2.5 nm (Figure 2A, red trace; Supporting Information, Movies 2–4).

We next modified the internal stiffness of the NPs to explore the
effects of their rigidity and found that clustering vanished for values
of the rigidity parameter k = 16 or below (Figure 2B). This result is
in agreement with that found in Monte Carlo simulations of inclusions
on a fluctuating surface by Weikl.25 The
suppression of membrane fluctuations was no longer observed in conditions
under which a loss of rigidity led to a loss of clustering (Supporting Information, Figure SI7A). We also
note that solvent depletion forces are still present for highly flexible
NPs, demonstrating that these were not sufficient for clustering.

These results showed that clustering in DPD simulations is strongly
dependent on the NP size and internal rigidity. Unfortunately, neither
of these properties can be modified experimentally in the STxB system.
However, the mechanical coupling of a NP onto the bilayer is experimentally
accessible and was therefore addressed next.

STxB Clustering Requires
Tight Mechanical Coupling to the Membrane
To test the importance
of tight mechanical coupling
between NPs and membrane, we added flexible linker segments (gray
beads in the schematics of Figure 2C) of increasing length (L-12 or L-22 carry 1 or 2
linker beads, respectively) to the lipid head groups (red beads).
In this DPD simulation, distal regions (green beads) remained attractive
to the toxin NPs, which therefore adsorbed to the membrane in all
cases. When toxin NPs were forced to aggregate, they separated again
when linkers were longer than 1 nm (Figure 2C, L-12 and L-22 conditions; black and red
traces/boxes, respectively; Supporting Information, Movies 5 and 6), whereas they remained
bound for up to 4.8 μs in all simulations in the absence of
any flexible linker segments (Figure 2C, L-02 condition, blue trace/box). Importantly, the
loss of clustering with increasing linker length again correlated
with the loss of suppression of membrane fluctuations (Supporting Information, Figure SI7B), pointing
to the possibility of a causal link between fluctuations and clustering
(see Discussion).

We returned to the
GUV/FCS setup to test experimentally how soft linkers influence STxB
clustering. For this, we synthesized three artificial Gb3 species:
C22:1 Gb3_EGn, in which the globotriose
sugar headgroup was separated from the ceramide backbone by 1, 3,
or 7 ethylene glycol (EG) units (Figure 3A), corresponding to 1.0, 1.75, or 3.25 nm
of extended linker length. Details of the chemical synthesis can be
found in the Supporting Information. GUVs
were prepared with these artificial Gb3 species, as described above.
The binding of STxB was similar in all cases (Figure 3B). By contrast, there was a marked difference
in the ability to form inward tubules (Figure 3C, black circles, D, and E), and the extent
of tubulation (Figure 3F) was clearly reduced with increasing linker length (Figure 3C, red boxes).

which FCS measurements were taken. (C) The percentage of vesicles
displaying tubulation decreases with increasing linker length (black

E, 10 μm.

Using FCS on micropipette
aspirated GUVs for which tubulation was
suppressed by tensing the membranes allowed us to precisely compare
the extent of STxB clustering for all lipids. Compared to the natural
C22:1 Gb3 species, STxB clustering kinetics was already slightly reduced
on C22:1 Gb3_EG1 (Figure 4). For Gb3_EG3 and Gb3_EG7, no
significant aggregation was observed as τD did not
extend beyond 20 ms and the width of τD distribution
remained comparable with time (Figure 4). Whereas clusters formed from natural Gb3 have hydrodynamic
radii of 180 nm, estimated as described in Supporting Information, those formed from Gb3_EG3 and Gb3_EG7 have a hydrodynamic radius that remains below 10 nm, which
is comparable to the size of a single STxB particle. These results
closely mirror the ones made with soft linkers in DPD simulations
(Figure 2C) and suggest
a systematic decrease in the degree of clustering, related to the
ethylene glycol linker lengths between the head and tail groups of
the corresponding Gb3 species. Since the density of toxins at the
cell surface is similar in all conditions, our findings further support
the absence of direct protein–protein interactions between
STxB molecules. These experiments provide evidence that tight mechanical
coupling onto the membrane is essential for STxB clustering.

linkers. Distributions of lifetimes for 200 nM STxB-Alexa488 on tensed
GUVs obtained from MEMFCS fitting for different lipids as a function
of time. On GUVs with C22:1 Gb3, STxB shows increased clustering at
longer time scales. STxB clustering on C22:1 Gb3_EG3 and
C22:1 Gb3_EG7 linker containing GUVs was strongly reduced.

To examine if flexible EG linkers
also affected STxB clustering
on cellular membranes, we incorporated synthetic C18:1 Gb3 or C18:1
Gb3_EG7 species into GSL-deficient GM95 cells. We first
showed that the binding of the toxin on the cells incorporated with
these lipids was similar (Figure 5A,B). Consistent with the experiments on GUVs, we found
using FCS measurements that STxB clustering was strongly compromised
on cells with C18:1 Gb3_EG7 species (Figure 5C,D,E).

We finally exploited phosphine-based quenching to differentiate
internalized STxB from plasma membrane-accessible extracellular STxB.
Using this approach, we found that the endocytic uptake of STxB was
strongly reduced on cells that were reconstituted with C18:1 Gb3_EG7 species, when compared to cells that were reconstituted with
natural C18:1 Gb3 (Figure 6A,B). Both the number of STxB-positive endosomes per cell
and the breadth of STxB fluorescence intensity distribution were strongly
reduced in the C18:1 Gb3_EG7 condition.

Thus, the mechanical coupling of STxB to the plasma membrane
and
its capacity to cluster were of critical importance to its efficient
uptake into cells.

Discussion
Clustering of the bacterial
Shiga toxin on the cellular plasma
membrane is required for infection of the cell. Several mechanisms
exist that could drive aggregate formation. At large length scales
of 10–100 nm, the acto-myosin machinery7 can bring the constituents together, while at the opposite limit
below 1 nm, attractive interactions such as screened electrostatics,
hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces take over.26 In between, depletion and capillary forces27 could act between the toxin particles and drive their aggregation.

Our experiments show that while depletion forces may always be
present, they are insufficient to cause clustering. Conversely, clustering
is not prevented on removing the sources of conventional capillary
forces such as lipid chain length mismatch between the toxin’s
cognate Gb3 lipids and surrounding membrane lipids, compositional
mismatch between the membrane environment under the toxin particles
and surrounding regions, and a modified membrane hydrophobic region
underneath the toxin. Shiga toxin clustering thus seems to be driven
by a generic mechanism whose sole requirements are (1) a fluid bilayer,
(2) large particle size (>3 nm), and (3) tight mechanical coupling
of the toxin proteins to the membrane. What physical principle could
drive this generic clustering? Because of the link of our findings
to membrane fluctuations (described below), we believe that a membrane
fluctuation-induced force best explains our results.

Fluctuation-induced
forces were first recognized by Casimir who
described the force experienced by two parallel, uncharged conductors
in a vacuum that confine quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic
field.28 Subsequently, Casimir-like forces
were postulated to arise universally in structured fluids characterized
by long-range fluctuations29,30 They were originally
proposed in the context of critical mixtures31 and soon after suggested as a mechanism of attraction between membrane
proteins at critical compositions.32 A
recent review describes many examples of so-called thermal Casimir
forces that have fundamental and technological importance.33 Of particular interest here is the possibility
that fluctuation-induced forces arise between the membrane-adsorbed
STxB particles because they suppress the thermally driven interfacial
fluctuations, that is, protrusions and undulations,34,35 of the membrane (See Supporting Information).

Such an effect has largely been ignored in the experimental
biophysical
literature because the first predictions of its strength between point-like
membrane inclusions had suggested that it was small compared to other
interactions between membrane proteins.15,36 It was subsequently
calculated to scale more strongly at short distances,29,37,38 and we have performed further
calculations using the proximity force approximation of Derjaguin39 to estimate the force and its distance dependence
for closely apposed rigid particles. These results show that it is
comparable to unscreened electrostatic interactions for nanometer
size inclusions (see Thermal Casimir Force section in the Supporting Information). The effective range
of the thermal Casimir force is predicted to be several nanometers
(i.e., comparable to the size of the nanoparticle).

We estimate
from FCS experiments on highly tensed vesicles (for
which invaginations cannot form) that clusters can grow into domains
that are hundreds of nanometers in size (Supporting Information), indicating their phase separation into toxin-rich
domains embedded in the surrounding toxin-poor membrane. When this
phase separation occurs on membranes with low values of membrane tension,
the small increment of curvature induced by each toxin particle, which
has been predicted from atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations14 to be 0.035 nm–1, creates
a spontaneous curvature in the toxin-rich domains40 that subsequently drives their tubular invagination,41,42 as seen in Figure 1B.

The thermal Casimir force depends on the ability of membrane-adsorbed
particles to suppress the thermal membrane fluctuations beneath them
because this restricts the fluctuation spectrum of the free membrane
regions and gives rise to the attractive force between the particles.25,38,43 It was therefore of interest
to note that STxB nanoparticles dampened the membrane’s thermal
fluctuations in our DPD simulations. Importantly, this suppression
of membrane fluctuations was not observed under the same conditions
in which loss of rigidity or the presence of long flexible linkers
led to a loss of clustering. The thermal Casimir effect is also expected
to increase with nanoparticle size and rigidity,43,44 which agrees with our simulations.

One unintuitive aspect
of the Casimir force is that it is nonadditive
as pointed out in several previous studies.45−48 The total Casimir force between
any pair of particles in a many body system is still attractive and
can be larger than the sum of the individual pairwise forces. Although
the ratio of the many-body contribution to the sum of the pairwise
forces is calculated to be negligible at large separations, it reaches
a factor of 2 at small separations and therefore strengthens the attraction.46,47

Probing the thermal Casimir force in membranes experimentally
is
a challenging task. It is not possible to use the temperature or membrane
tension as control parameters because membranes undergo phase changes
or rupture events within a relatively small range of temperatures
or values of membrane tension. The relevant short-distance behavior
caused by the Casimir-like force is practically insensitive to changes
within this experimentally accessible regime of temperatures or membrane
tension values.29,30

For experimental testing,
we therefore exploited the fact that
the thermal Casimir force arises only when membrane inclusions locally
suppress membrane fluctuations,30,43 as validated in our
simulations. Using Gb3 species for which flexible linkers separate
the carbohydrate part from the ceramide backbone, thus removing the
suppression of the membrane fluctuations at the binding sites of the
B-subunit of Shiga toxin (STxB), we could experimentally show that
a tight mechanical coupling of STxB onto the membrane was required
for toxin clustering. Therefore, unlike the capillary forces mentioned
above, whose removal one by one did not prevent the clustering, when
the conditions for the thermal Casimir force are removed (by displacing
the toxin particles with the linker) the clustering is eliminated,
indicating that the thermal Casimir force is essential for clustering
to occur.

The thermal Casimir force hypothesis provides a fresh
view of clustering
processes that operate in concert on biological membranes. It is also
versatile compared to mechanisms such as capillary attraction because
the only constraint on the (fluid) membrane composition is the presence
of an appropriate binding partner (e.g., the GSL Gb3 for STxB). We
hypothesize that bacterial and viral evolution proceeding only by
modifying the protein sequence of the infectious disease particles
has harnessed a generic, fundamental force to initiate cellular entry
that solely requires conserved binding sites for GSLs. Many pathogens
and pathogenic factors bind to GSLs for their entry into cells,49 indicating that a Casimir-like force-driven
clustering mechanism may apply also to these. Furthermore, thermal
Casimir interactions should occur for manufactured rigid nanoparticles
that tightly adsorb onto the plasma membrane. The clustering mechanism
that we describe here is therefore expected to contribute to cellular,
pathogenic, and pharmaceutical drug delivery processes.

Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama, USA). GUVs were prepared by electroformation.16 One microliter of DOPC/X (X = C22:1, C22:1 Gb3_EG1, C22:1 Gb3_EG3, or C22:1 Gb3_EG7) at
95:5 ratio at 1 mg/mL in chloroform was spread on two indium tin oxide-coated
glass plate electrodes that were spaced 4 mm apart. The electrodes
with the lipid films were immersed in a chamber containing 320 mM
sucrose solution and were connected to a power generator. Electroformation
was performed at 2 V and 10 Hz for 1 h at 65 °C. The GUVs were
released from the electrodes by changing the frequency to 2 Hz for
30 min, and transferred into a chamber with equiosmolar PBS.

Micropipette
Aspiration
Glass micropipettes were prepared
using a Sutter P-2000 micropipette puller (Novato, USA). The glass
micropipettes were passivated with β-casein at 5 mg/mL. GUVs
were placed in a homemade chamber consisting of two coverslips separated
by 1 mm, aspirated with a glass micropipette, and membrane tension
was adjusted by changing the difference of hydrostatic pressure.50 For each GUV used for FCS measurements, the
membrane was stressed to approximately 10–3 N/m
to minimize intensity variations contributed by the fluctuations of
the membrane along the long axis of the focal spot.

Fluorescence
Correlation Spectroscopy
FCS was performed
using a Picoquant accessory FCS unit on a Nikon confocal scanning
microscope. STxB was labeled with Alexa488 (Life Technologies), according
to the manufacturers instructions. The 488 nm beam was focused on
the bottom pole of the membrane, and the emission was collected from
510 to 560 nm using a dichroic mirror and a filter in front of the
avalanche photodiodes. Data were collected using Symphotime64 software
and exported in ASCII format for independent data analysis. Every
6 min, data were collected in run lengths of 30 s for a total duration
of 30 min and then grouped. The autocorrelation curve for every recording
was averaged and used for MEMFCS analysis (Supporting Information, Figure SI13).

Data Analysis
The FCS data was analyzed according to
the maximum entropy method using17  MEMFCS minimizes χ2 as well
as maximizes the entropic quantity, defined by S =
∑ipi ln pi, which then detects a distribution of diffusion times, the amplitude
of which is related as  for each event. G(0) corresponds
to the sum of all amplitudes. By normalizing the amplitudes, the logarithmic
distribution of diffusion times represents the probability that a
specific noninteracting species has a particular diffusion time. Typically,
the distribution maximizes at the most probable diffusion time for
a single distribution. Fits were obtained by setting the number of
species to 150, with the diffusion times ranging from 1 × 10–3 to 1000 ms. The fits were deemed good by the residuals
for all the curves and the apparent diffusion times corresponding
to photophysical processes and diffusion were verified independently
by a membrane binding protein, MinD (53 kDa), labeled with Alexa488.
The fact that the time scales of the photophysical processes are below
0.01 ms as expected and diffusion times of MinD peak at a few milliseconds
verifies the MEMFCS fitting routine and confirms the diffusion time
of monomeric STxB (Supporting Information, Figure SI16).

Incorporation of Lipids into Cell Membranes
For incorporation
of lipids, GM95 cells were incubated for 48 h in serum free medium
with C18:1 Gb3 or C18:1 Gb3_EG7. To minimize the amount
of Gb3 nonspecifically attached to cells and the glass surface, cells
were washed 3 times with medium containing 10% FCS. Subsequently cells
were detached with accutase, collected by centrifugation, and replated
in fibronectin-coated glass bottom dishes for 60 min. Cells were incubated
with 0.5 μM STxB-Alexa488 for 20 min at 37 °C, washed to
remove unbound STxB, and imaged at RT. C18:1 Gb3_EG7 incorporated
into the plasma membrane less efficiently than C18:1 Gb3. To achieve
comparable STxB-Alexa488 intensities on the plasma membrane, lipid
and toxin concentration were adjusted: C18:1 Gb3 was incorporated
at 3.3 μM, and C18:1 Gb3_EG7 at 50 μM.

Endocytosis
Assay
STxB-Cy5 was allowed to bind on ice
to GM95 cells incorporated with C18:1 Gb3 or C18:1 Gb3_EG7 for 15 min in DMEM buffer supplemented with HEPES at 25 mM. Cells
were shifted for 10 min to 37 °C and fixed with 4% PFA in phosphate
buffer. To quench the fluorescence of membrane bound, noninternalized
STxB-Cy5, samples were imaged in a buffer containing 0.2 M Tris at
pH 9, 100 mM TCEP, 5% glucose, 1 mM ascorbic acid, and an oxygen scavenging
system consisting of 0.5 mg/mL glucose oxidase, 40 μg/mL catalase,
and 5% glucose.51 Exposing to 633 nm laser
quenched all extracellular STxB-Cy5 and allowed distinguished imaging
of endocytosed STxB-Cy5 (Supporting Information, Figure SI14). Quantification of endocytosis efficiency on cells
reconstituted with C18:1 Gb3 or C18:1 Gb3_EG7 was carried
out with a custom MATLAB software that identifies and measures the
intensity of individual endosomes.
