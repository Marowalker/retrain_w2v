Three-dimensional (3D) porous metal nanostructures have been a
long sought-after class of materials due to their collective properties
and widespread applications. In this study, we report on a facile
and versatile strategy for the formation of Au hydrogel networks involving
the dopamine-induced 3D assembly of Au nanoparticles. Following supercritical
drying, the resulting Au aerogels exhibit high surface areas and porosity.
They are all composed of porous nanowire networks reflecting in their
diameters those of the original particles (5–6 nm) via electron microscopy. Furthermore, electrocatalytic tests
were carried out in the oxidation of some small molecules with Au
aerogels tailored by different functional groups. The beta-cyclodextrin-modified
Au aerogel, with a host–guest effect, represents a unique class
of porous metal materials of considerable interest and promising applications
for electrocatalysis.

Assembling
of colloidal nanocrystals
into nanostructured materials with macroscopic dimensions has attracted
growing research interest in the last decades, since their collective
properties might be superior to those of the individual nanocrystals
as well as bulk samples.1−4 Considerable effort has been made in the self- or
directed-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) into one, two, and three
dimensions. This concept provides a tailored, bottom-up approach to
material design and enlarges the scope of potential applications.5−8 However, the merging of nanosized entities with their unique optical,
electronic, and/or magnetic properties into materials with macrodimensions
that can be easily manipulated and processed is still a challenge.
Recently, gels and aerogels fabricated from various metal and semiconductor
NPs available in colloidal solutions have been demonstrated to offer
such an avenue.9,10

Aerogels are highly porous
materials with ultralow density, high
surface area, and large open interconnected pores.11,12 Significant progress has been achieved among others by the Brock,
Leventis, and Kanatzidis groups as well as ours, which led to a variety
of aerogel components and opened up enormous opportunities for semiconductor
technologies, catalysis, optoelectronics, sorbents, and filters.13−16 In particular, the interest in noble metal aerogels has sparked
sustained research to develop synthetic methods and potential applications
because of their unique electronic, catalytic, and optical characteristics.
For example, our group reported on a series of mono/multi-noble metal
aerogels prepared from solutions of colloidal NPs via a controllable destabilization approach.17,18 Further research has shown that such noble metal aerogels exhibited
excellent performance in electrocatalysis, used as advanced electrocatlysts
or metal porous supports.19,20 An interesting step
has been made on metal nanoshell aerogels derived from the assembly
of hollow structures (Ag, Au/Ag, Pd/Ag, Pt/Ag) by Arachchige etal.21,22 As is well
known, Au nanostructures have been extensively studied, driven by
their fascinating properties and widespread applications in nanoelectronics,
biomedicine, sensing, catalysis, etc.23−25 Various monometallic Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd and bi- or trimetallic composite
aerogels were prepared via different approaches such
as oxidation-, salt-, and temperature-induced aggregation as well
as a spontaneous gelation, where the issues of gelation time and the
avoidance of preaggregation have been solved for Pd and Ag.16,21 The only example thus far referring to monometallic Au aerogels
involves strongly preaggregated original colloidal particles (larger
than 100 nm) and long gelation time (1 week), thus limiting further
applications.17 Considering Au NPs that
have often been restricted by their tendency to sinter to large-size
aggregates, to date, the fabrication of Au aerogels with nanosized
metal backbones by a direct sol–gel method and especially their
applications still remain largely unexplored and a great challenge.

In this contribution, we reported on a facile strategy for preparing
Au aerogels composed of three-dimensional (3D) nanowire-like networks
by dopamine-induced assembly of Au NPs. The primary structural units
of the resulting Au aerogels match the sizes of the original particles
(5–6 nm). Here, dopamine acts as an efficient destabilizing
agent for the controlled assembly of Au NPs into a branched network
with various capping ligands, namely, beta-cyclodexrin (β-CD),
citrate, and nonstabilizers (without organic surface ligands). Compared
to established methods, this synthetic procedure is distinguished
by a fast, simple, and versatile gelation without preaggregation of
the NPs. The as-prepared Au aerogels possess different functional
groups and exhibit large surface areas and high porosity. Taking glucose
and ethanol as examples, electrochemical results show that the catalytic
progress is greatly promoted by the Au aerogel functionalized with
β-CD.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 Photographs of Au colloids before and
after the addition of dopamine
with different concentrations: 7.5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μM,
respectively. Time = 5 days (up) and the as-prepared Au aerogels (bottom).

The building blocks for the β-CD-modified
Au hydrogel were
directly synthesized by reducing chloroauric acid with sodium borohydride
in the presence of natural β-CD at room temperature, which have
an average diameter of 5.0 ± 1.0 nm (β-CD–Au NPs;
see Figure S1, Supporting Information).
The β-CD is expected to adsorb on the surface of the Au NPs
and stabilize the particles due to steric effects and the surface
charge of −39.8 mV.26 It is reported
that dopamine can form a host–guest inclusion complex with
β-CD in aqueous solution,27 and it
might also adsorb and interact with the Au surface due to the strong
affinity between dopamine and the Au core.28,29 Thus, dopamine could be employed as a destabilizing agent to induce
the β-CD–Au NPs to assemble into a hydrogel. Prior to
the addition of the dopamine, the NP solution for each sample was
wine red and stable for at least three months. The gelation of the
Au hydrogels was initiated by the introduction of dopamine into this
solution. Fluffy black solids settled out of the solution within 6
h at high concentrations of dopamine (i.e., 100 μM), while at 10 μM dopamine, the gelation process
was extended to 2 days (details can be seen from Table 1 and Figure 1). It is found that the gelation kinetics
can be tuned by the concentration of the destabilizer. The Au hydrogel
induced by lower concentrations of dopamine (i.e., 7.5 μM) showed a light gray supernatant after
1 week, while 2.5 μM dopamine would not work for Au NP gelation
even after 3 months (Figure S2). Our presented
method enables a rapid gelation of the β-CD–Au NPs by
simple addition of the appropriate amount of dopamine. In addition
to no need for concentrating the initial sols, which is generally
required in the sol–gel transformation of NP colloids,17,18,20−22 the method
is easy to scale up.

After supercritically drying
with CO2, the four Au aerogel
samples (formed with the aid of 10, 20, 50, and 100 μM dopamine,
respectively) reveal almost the same morphologies as seen in scanning
and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), as shown in Figure 2 and Figure S3. The evolving structures are highly
porous and composed of interconnected networks of ultrathin wire-like
structures with many bifurcations. They exhibit a very broad pore
size distribution with open meso- and macropores. The average diameters
of the wires are 5.8 ± 1.0, 5.8 ± 1.0, 5.9 ± 1.0, and
5.7 ± 1.0 nm, respectively, which are of similar size to the
starting β-CD–Au NPs, thus suggesting direct fusion of
the original particles. The typical electron diffraction pattern presented
in Figure 2D shows
diffraction rings that prove the polycrystalline nature of the nanowires
shown in the corresponding TEM image. According to a rough estimate
based on volume and weight of several pieces of the black Au aerogels,
the average densities of the materials are calculated to be 0.041
± 0.002 g cm–3, corresponding to less than
1/500 of the bulk density of Au. This value fits into the typical
range of aerogel densities (0.004–0.500 g cm–3), being much smaller than those of other porous Au structures.30−32 From the physical properties and morphologies of the Au aerogels
produced by different concentrations of dopamine, we may deduce that
the concentration of the destabilizer affects only the speed of the
Au NP gelation, but not the final structures of the aerogels (cf. also ref (19)). Considering the ease of the Au aerogel preparation and the consumption
of the agents, a Au aerogel induced by 20 μM dopamine (noted
as Auβ-CD) was chosen as an example for further
investigations.

Figure 2 SEM (A), TEM (B, C), and electron diffraction (D) of the
Auβ-CD.

A representative powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of
a Auβ-CD aerogel sample in Figure 3A displays diffraction peaks
that can be
assigned to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (220) planes of a
face-centered-cubic (fcc) polycrystalline structure, which is in accordance
with the electron diffraction. The broad Bragg reflections are due
to the nanoparticulate nature of the as-prepared Au aerogel. The Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the Auβ-CD exhibits typical CD absorption features of the coupled C–O–C
stretching/O–H bending vibrations at 1156 cm–1, the coupled C–O/C–C stretching/O–H bending
vibrations at 1030 and 1080 cm–1, CH and CH2 stretching vibrations at 2800–3000 cm–1, and a broad hydroxyl band at 3300–3500 cm–1 (O–H stretching) and at 1643 cm–1 (OH groups
of the glucose moieties), respectively (Figure 3B). This suggests that the aerogel surface
was capped with β-CD molecules. The amount of the surface coverage
was investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An
about 18 wt % of β-CD was suggested in the aerogel sample, which
is in good agreement with the inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) results with a Au content of 81%.

(A) and FT-IR spectrum (B) of the Auβ-CD.

The data derived from the wide-scan
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectrum (Figure 4) display that the aerogel samples show as main elemental components
Au, C, and O, coincident with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) data (Figure S4A). High-resolution
XPS was performed to gain more insight into the structure of the as-prepared
Au aerogel sample. The C 1s spectrum was deconvoluted into four component
peaks, which are assigned to the saturated hydrocarbons (C–C,
285.0 eV), C–O–(C, H) (286.7 eV), and O–C–O
(288.6 eV) of the β-CD molecules and some small amount of oxidized
groups (C=O). Such observations depict the presence of a large
number of highly functionalized carbon-containing molecules and further
confirm the presence of β-CD in the Au aerogel.33 Additionally, the recorded Au 4f spectrum was composed
of the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 peaks with the binding energy at 84.2
and 87.9 eV, respectively, indicating mainly metallic gold of the
sample. A small, but not-negligible signal for N 1s was observed at
399.6 eV via high-resolution XPS, which can be ascribed
to the dopamine in the final aerogel product.

high-resolution C 1s (B), Au 4f (C), and
N 1s (D) spectra of the Auβ-CD.

The N2 physisorption isotherm for the
Auβ-CD provides information on the surface
area and porosity properties.
We observe a type II isotherm that is characteristic for macroporous
materials. The surface area mainly reflects the adsorption on the
walls of these macropores and is determined to be 50.1 m2 g–1 by fitting the data to a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation. This is considerably larger than those of other porous
Au materials.34 The pore size distribution
of the Auβ-CD (Figure 5B) shows the presence of a broad range of
pores from micro- to mesopores. The existence of micropores with a
maximum at 1.4 nm can be attributed to the high content of β-CD
in the Au aerogel.35 The hierarchically
porous structure of the Au aerogel with large surface area may offer
more reaction sites and enable faster diffusion for the substrates
in catalysis.

and cumulative pore volumes (Vcumulative, B) of the Auβ-CD aerogel.

To monitor the formation process of the Au hydrogel
induced by
dopamine, UV–vis spectroscopy and TEM were conducted, providing
evidence for a time-dependent growth (Figures 6, 7, and S5). Upon addition of 20 μM dopamine, the
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of the Au colloid is broadened
and decreases with a slight red shift, from 513 to 524 nm, together
with an obvious increase of the long-wavelength SPR band over time.
These generally indicate the formation of larger nanostructures compared
to nanopaticular Au.36 One may notice the
gradually decreases of the long-wavelength SPR with increasing time,
which is due to the settling of the big network structures. It is
clear from the corresponding TEM images that the fast growth of the
Au hydrogel can be observed starting with the well-dispersed β-CD–Au
NPs, via small assemblies composed of several NPs
to short nanowires, small branched networks, and finally to large-scale
interconnected nanowire networks within 2 h. About 2 days later, a
Au hydrogel composed of highly porous nanowire networks is formed
at the bottom of the bottle. Notably the dimensions of all the intermediates
as well as those of the final hydrogel and aerogel are in the same
size range as the original NPs (5–6 nm), and no preagglomerations
occur into any kind of secondary structures.

We anticipate that the host–guest interaction between
dopamine
and β-CD could be one of the driving forces for the Au hydrogel
formation from the β-CD–Au NPs. The XPS analysis of the
Auβ-CD shows, compared to β-CD–Au
NPs, a significantly reduced atom ratio of C to Au (from 3.03 to 1.83),
indicating a partial removal of β-CD from the Au surface during
the dopamine-induced assembly. It is likely that dopamine induces
the assembly of Au NPs into the fused nanowires starting from a partial
loss of the β-CD surfactants, which initially stabilizes the
particles against aggregation, as a consequence of the competition
between dopamine and Au NPs. Driven by this host–guest interaction-induced
assembly, a number of other guests for β-CD having similar complexion
constants are suitable for the NP gelation. However, as seen in Figure 8A–C with increased
concentration of these guests, instead of branched nanowire networks,
the treatments of the β-CD–Au NPs yield different structures
passing the state of fusion of several particles.

Figure 8 TEM images of Au assemblies
induced by pyrocatechol (A, 500 μM),
2-phenylethylamine hydrochloride (B, 100 μM), and ferrocenecarboxylic
acid (C, 100 μM) from β-CD–Au NPs. TEM images of
Au assemblies induced by 20 μM dopamine from NS–Au NPs
(D), Cit–Au NPs (E), and 5-HSTz–Au NPs (F).

Three kinds of Au NPs tailored by citrate, 5-mercaptomethyltetrazole
(5-HSTz), and nonstabilizers, which were designated as Cit–Au
NPs, 5-HSTz–Au NPs, and NS–Au NPs, were introduced to
the dopamine-induced assembly. With 20 μM dopamine, both Au
NPs with no or quite weak stabilizers (i.e., citrate) gelate and form a nanowire network (noted as
AuNS and AuCit, respectively). The average wire
diameters (6.2 ± 1.4 and 4.9 ± 1.0 nm) match well with the
sizes of the original NPs, similar to the results with the β-CD–Au
NPs. In contrast, Au NPs with the strong stabilizer 5-HSTz remain
unaltered nanoparticular Au sols (Figures 8 and S6). Dopamine
is strongly bound to the Au NPs’ surface and acts as a ligand
competing with the initial “stabilizers”, further interacting
with the Au core.28,37−39 Here the existence
of dopamine in the final aerogel samples is evidenced via XPS (Figure 4D).
Hence the Au NPs with rather weak protections are easily attacked
by dopamine for surface ligand exchange and subsequent interaction,
resulting in branched nanowire-like hydrogels. The Au–S bond
between 5-HSTz and the Au NPs is strong enough to protect the Au core
from particle fusion.40 Typically, the
destabilization of a Au NP sol leads to uncontrolled aggregation;
here the dopamine-induced route realized a simple, yet efficient way
for 3D assembly of several kinds of Au NPs. It not only provides a
novel strategy for producing high-quality Au aerogels with different
functional groups but also offers opportunities for further applications
in catalysis, sensing, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, etc.

Due to the high activity and selectivity for
catalytic reactions,
nanostructured Au materials have gained stained and growing interest
in catalysis and sensing.41,42 In addition, materials
with multimodal or hierarchical porosity facilitate mass transport
and exhibit both increased surface area and reaction sites.43−45 In this regard, the Au aerogels prepared in this work with high
surface area and broad open porosity are first tested as advanced
electrocatalysts for the oxidation of glucose, as it is of great importance
for sugar sensing in human blood and their potential use in fuel cells.46,47

As shown in Figure 9A, all Au aerogel modified glassy carbon electrodes (i.e., Auβ-CD/GCE,
Aucit/GCE, and AuNS/GCE) depict the electrochemical
characteristics for Au in alkaline solution, where the anodic oxidation
current starts at about 0.20 V due to the formation of Au oxide that
is subsequently reduced, as indicated by the appearance of a reduction
peak in the negative potential scan. The Auβ-CD/GCE shows the smallest peak-to-peak potential separation, implying
the fastest electron-transfer kinetics at the electrode surface.48,49 In addition, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the
Au aerogels were estimated using the reduction charge of Au oxide
obtained from the cyclic voltammograms (CVs), which are 18.2, 11.1,
and 16.0 m2 g–1 for Auβ-CD, Aucit, and AuNS, respectively. The larger
ECSA for Au aerogel functionalized with β-CD provide more active
sites for the further electrocatalytic reactions.

electrodes in the absence (A) and presence (B) of 4 mM glucose in
0.1 M NaOH at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. (C) Current
densities for 4 mM glucose oxidation on three Au aerogel modified
glassy carbon electrodes. (D) Plots of the electrocatalytic current
of glucose vs concentration (2–30 mM) of the
modified electrodes.

After the addition of different concentrations of glucose,
two
anodic peaks attributed to the oxidation of glucose are observed in
the positive potential scan with all Au aerogel modified glassy carbon
electrodes (GCEs). Again an anodic peak corresponding to the glucose
oxidation is found in the negative potential scan once the oxide layer
is reduced (Figure 9B and Figure S7). The calibration curves
corresponding to the amperometric response against the glucose concentration
are illustrated in Figure 9D. The Auβ-CD/GCE exhibits very high
activity toward glucose oxidation with a sensitivity of 332.9 ±
7.6 μA mM–1 cm–2 (n = 7) in the range of 0 to 20 mM, which is superior to
those reported in the literature (see Table S1). Meanwhile, the controlled experiments show that all of the three
Au aerogels have much higher catalytic activities than the corresponding
NPs when applied as electrocatalysts (Figure S8). This is mainly because the Au aerogels increase the conductance
and electron transfer for the electrocatalysis on one hand, and on
the other hand, the open porous structures of the Au aerogels not
only allow fast transport of glucose through the electrolyte/electrode
interface but also ensure contact with a larger reaction surface due
to the high surface area. It is noted that the Auβ-CD aerogel shows the highest catalytic activities regardless of the
mass or specific current density. Similar electrocatalytic results
(i.e., best performance on a Auβ-CD aerogel) are obtained when the three Au aerogels
with different capping ligands are applied for the oxidation of ethanol,
another important small molecule in fuel cell reactions (see Supporting Information, Figures S9 and S10).
Most probably this enhancement is because of the faster electron-transfer
kinetics and larger ECSA at the Auβ-CD/GCE
surface mentioned before and the intermolecular interaction between
substrates (glucose and ethanol) and β-CD.50 Additionally, the Auβ-CD aerogel
modified electrode shows little electrochemical response on 0.2 mM
ascorbic acid and uric acid, two common coexisting interferences51,52 (see Figure S11), indicating its good
selectivity for glucose. After 100 successive scans the Au aerogel
modified electrode shows more than 96% of the initial catalytic current
and almost no change after 4 weeks’ storage at room temperature
toward the oxidation of glucose. These results suggest that the Au
aerogel exhibits high sensitivity, broad linear range, and good stability,
demonstrating the promise of the Auβ-CD/GCE
as a nonenzymatic sensing electrode for analytical applications.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a new and facile
synthesis of Au aerogels via a dopamine-induced route,
where the Au aerogels are composed of 3D nanowire networks that exhibit
diameters of 5–6 nm as the original particles together with
very high surface area and large hierarchical porosity. Interestingly,
capping the NPs with different surface ligands yields Au aerogels
with the respective functional groups. Applied in electrocatalysis,
Au aerogel modified electrodes offer high activities toward the nonenzymatic
oxidation of glucose, which carries potential for high-performance
glucose sensors and fuel cells. Our approach not only provides a template-free
method for the 3D assembly of Au NPs into highly porous aerogels but
also holds promise for their superior sensing and catalysis applications.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Materials
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate
(HAuCl4·3H2O, 99.9%), sodium citrate, dopamine
hydrochloride, 2-phenylethylamine hydrochloride, pyrocatechol, 5 wt
% Nafion, and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were bought from
Sigma-Aldrich. β-d-(+)-Glucose was also purchased from
Sigma, and the stock solution was allowed to mutorotate at room temperature
overnight before use. β-CD was received from VWR. Commercial
Pd/C catalyst (Pd, 20% on activated carbon powder) was purchased from
Alfa Aesar. Ferrocenecarboxylic acid (Fc) was received from Fluka.
Acetone (⩾99.8%) and absolute ethanol were obtained from Merck.
A 0.1 or 1 M NaOH solution was used as supporting electrolyte for
the electrocatalytic experiments. Other chemicals were of analytical
grade, and Milli-Q water was used throughout.

Au Nanoparticle Synthesis
First, all glassware was
cleaned with freshly prepared aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 = 3:1) and rinsed thoroughly in water. The β-CD–Au
NPs was synthesized according to the reported method with modification.53 In a typical synthesis, 348 μL of 10%
HAuCl4 was added into 398 mL of 10 mM β-CD under
continuous stirring for 10 min, and then 2 mL of freshly prepared
180 mM NaBH4 was quickly added into the solution. The above
solution was kept stirring for about 2 h to get a wine red Au colloid.
The citrate-stabilized Au NPs (Cit–Au NPs) was prepared via a similar strategy to that above, where 10 mM β-CD
was replaced by a 0.3 wt % sodium citrate solution. For the Au NPs
without capping ligands (NS–Au NPs), it was synthesized by
reducing a gold precursor in the absence of any stabilizing ligands,
under otherwise identical experimental conditions. The 5-HSTz-modified
Au NPs were obtained according to our previous method, by first preparing
Cit–Au NPs and subsequent ligand exchange.54

Preparation of Au Hydrogels and Aerogels
Hydrogels
from β-CD–Au NPs were produced by adding 80 μL
of varied concentrations of dopamine solution (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and
0.5 M) to the above β-CD-modified Au colloids to give a final
concentration of 10, 20, 50, and 100 μM, respectively. After
slightly shaking for 5 min, 400 mL of the above solution was divided
into 100 mL and then settled at room temperature. Fluffy black solids
settled out of the solution down to the bottom of the flask from 6
h to within 3 days, depending on the concentration of dopamine. After
carefully washing with at least 15 times the amount of water and stepwise
replacing the supernatant by acetone (10 times, twice per day), the
resulting anhydrous, acetone-containing gels were transferred into
a critical point dryer for supercritical CO2 drying. The
Au hydrogels and aerogels both possess a black color. The other guests,
2-phenylethylamine hydrochloride, pyrocatechol, and Fc-induced β-CD–Au
NP assembly, and the Cit–Au NPs and NS−Au NPs induced
by 20 μM dopamine were obtained via a method
similar to that above.

Electrocatalytic Experiments
A GCE
(3 mm in diameter)
was polished with a 1.0 and 0.3 μm alumina slurry sequentially
and then washed ultrasonically in water and ethanol for a few minutes,
respectively. The cleaned GCE was dried with an air steam for the
next modification. Au aerogels (i.e., β-CD-, citrate-, and nonstabilizer-modified Au aerogels,
noted as Auβ-CD, Aucit, and AuNS, respectively) derived from different NPs were dispersed
in water to obtain black suspensions with a metal concentration of
1.0 mg mL–1 (evaluated by ICP-OES). 4 or 3 μL
of the as-prepared aerogel dispersions was deposited on the clean
GCEs, which were left to dry in the oven at about 40 °C followed
by coating 2 μL of 0.5% Nafion for further electrochemical experiments.

Apparatus and Measurements
CO2 supercritical
drying was conducted on critical point dryer model 13200J-AB obtained
from SPI Supplies. Since the drying process was carried out in baskets
close to spherical in shape, the resulting aerogel monoliths are shaped
like a sphere, and volumes were calculated accordingly. After weighing
them via a precise balance (0.0001 g), the mass density
of the as-prepared Au aerogel samples was roughly estimated by weight/volume
(n = 9). TEM was performed on a TECNAI T20 at an
accelerating voltage of 200 kV. SEM and EDS were performed on a Zeiss
DSM 982 Gemini instrument. XRD was carried out in reflection mode
on an X’Pert Pro multipurpose powder diffract meter operated
at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å). The data were collected in the 5–90°
(2θ) range with a step size of Δ2θ = 0.026°.
XPS studies were carried out by means of an Axis Ultra photoelectron
spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, England). UV–vis
spectroscopy was recorded on a Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
ICP-OES was carried out on a PerkinElmer Optima 7000DV optical emission
spectrometer. Nitrogen physisorption isotherms were measured at 77
K on a Quantachrome Autosorb 1 instrument. About 50 mg of Au aerogels
was transferred into the measuring cell and degassed overnight at
323 K under vacuum before measurement. The pore size distribution
of the Au aerogel was assessed using the quenched solid density functional
theory equilibrium model (N2 on carbon) based on a slit-shaped
pore geometry because of the surface coverage with β-CD. FT-IR
spectroscopy was performed on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 8700 FT-IR
spectrometer configured with a Smart iTR diamond accessory. TGA was
measured on a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC1 STRAe system under an argon
flow of about 30 mL min–1 in the temperature range
25–1000 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. Zeta-potential measurements were performed on a Delsa Nano C particle
analyzer (Beckman Coulter Corporation). All electrochemical measurements
were performed at an Autolab/PGSTAT 30 (Eco Chemie B. V. Utrecht,
The Netherlands) in an earthed Faraday cage. The modified GC electrode
was used as the working electrode. Platinum foil and Ag/AgCl (1 M
KCl) were employed as the counter electrode and the reference electrode,
respectively.
