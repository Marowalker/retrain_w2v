Two-dimensional
(2D) materials with strong in-plane anisotropy
are of interest for enabling orientation-dependent, frequency-tunable,
optomechanical devices. However, black phosphorus (bP), the 2D material
with the largest anisotropy to date, is unstable as it degrades in
air. In this work we show that As2S3 is an interesting
alternative, with a similar anisotropy to bP, while at the same time
having a much higher chemical stability. We probe the mechanical and
optical anisotropy in As2S3 by three distinct
angular-resolved experimental methods: Raman spectroscopy, atomic
force microscopy (AFM), and resonance frequency analysis. Using a
dedicated angle-resolved AFM force-deflection method, an in-plane
anisotropy factor of  is found in the Young’s
modulus
of As2S3 with Ea-axis = 79.1 ± 10.1 GPa and Ec-axis = 47.2 ± 7.9 GPa.
The high mechanical anisotropy is also shown to cause up to 65% difference
in the resonance frequency, depending on crystal orientation and aspect
ratio of membranes.

==== Body
After the
first exfoliation
and characterization of graphene in 2004,1 2D crystals have attracted much interest as suspended membranes
in mechanical systems due to their unprecedented high elastic moduli
and strength.2−5 Although resonators of many 2D materials, such as graphene and MoS2, have been widely studied,5−8 there are only a few 2D crystals known that
exhibit large in-plane anisotropy.9−14 Black phosphorus (bP) shows the largest known anisotropy in Young’s
modulus among 2D materials15,16 with a ratio of  along
the in-plane axes (b and a). However,
few-layer bP is stable in air
for only several minutes,17 which severely
affects its mechanical properties after oxidation18 and complicates its application and integration into complex
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).

Here, we discuss the exfoliation
of As2S3 including in its monolayer form and
the fabrication of suspended
membranes of this material. Although As2S3 has
been studied and applied in its bulk and amorphous form, it has not
received much attention in its ultrathin exfoliated form. The anisotropy
in the Raman spectrum of As2S3 is compared to
the mechanical anisotropy in its static deflection probed by atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and in its dynamic deflection probed by a change
in the resonance frequency of mechanical modes. We show that thin
layers of As2S3 have a mechanical anisotropy
comparable to that of black phosphorus, while their stability against
degradation in ambient air facilitates integration and study of few-layer
As2S3 resonators in complex mechanical devices.
In addition to that, the material has perspectives to become an important
member of the class of 2D materials due to a unique combination of
properties: As2S3 is known to transmit infrared
well,19 has an optical indirect band gap
of ∼2.6 eV,20,21 shows photoconductivity,22,23 and has a large acousto-optical figure of merit.24 This combination of properties makes it of interest for
fundamental studies of anisotropic phenomena in 2D materials, but
can also enable new types of applications such as acousto-optic modulators.25

Results and Discussion
Structure and Characterization
Arsenic trisulfide,
also known as orpiment,26 is a naturally
occurring layered crystal. The unit cell of the As2S3 lattice consists of two layers inverted through a symmetry
center located in a van der Waals gap (Figure 1b). From the crystallographical point of
view, a unit cell of arsenic trisulfide is defined by 20 atoms (10
atoms for a monolayer)21 compared to two
for graphene, three for MoS2, and eight for black phosphorus,
which makes it one of the most structurally complex 2D materials known.
Natural As2S3 crystals are of a high purity
(see Supporting Information (SI) 1), have
low interlayer binding energy,21,27 and have an exfoliation
energy comparable to graphite.20 These
properties enable the use of conventional methods for exfoliation
and transfer of flakes28,29 when additional safety precautions
are applied due to the toxicity of the material.30,31 Natural crystals of As2S3 can be well exfoliated,
as indicated by the tapping mode AFM measurements in Figure 1d, which show flakes as thin
as 0.83 nm with consecutive step heights ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 nm.
The monolayer thickness is expected to be a half of the unit cell
along the b-axis, tAs2S3 = 0.5 × 0.96 nm = 0.48 nm.26 Since the step height observed in AFM is less than twice
the layer thickness, we conclude that we have exfoliated a monolayer
of As2S3. A similar 40–60% difference
between the measured AFM step height and expected thickness of a single
layer has been also observed in AFM studies of other 2D materials
and might be related to intercalation effects.33 As shown in the AFM image in Figure 1e, the thickness of the As2S3 monolayer remains virtually unchanged after three months
in air under ambient light. The multilayer flakes of As2S3, which were exfoliated from the same crystal as the
monolayer, are stable for hours at low or ambient light conditions
(see SI 1), such that it is likely that
no degradation occurs in the absence of light. This stability is an
important advantage over other strongly anisotropic 2D materials such
as black phosphorus that decompose rapidly in air,17 as can be seen in AFM measurements.34 The stability in ambient conditions of As2S3 can be attributed to its low solubility in water32,35 and low oxidation rate in air in the absence of excessive exposure
to light.36,37

We fabricated
a number of samples with flake thicknesses, t, varying
from 0.8 to 129 nm. Flakes were transferred on
top of a prepatterned Si/SiO2 chip with 12 rectangular
cavities. Each subsequent rectangle is rotated by a 30° angle
with respect to the previous one and has a length of the longest side, b, considerably larger than its width, a. We estimate the orientation of the optical axes of each flake using
polarized light microscopy,10 thus taking
advantage of the transcendent in-plane birefringence of the crystal:
ΔnAs2S3 measures
∼0.35 around visible frequencies,38 which is ∼1.4× higher than of black phosphorus and ∼10×
that of ReS2.12 This allows
us to coarse-align the optical axes of the flakes to one of the cavities
(see SI 2). A flake transferred on top
of this prepatterned array of cavities forms a star-shaped mechanical
resonator, such that the stiffness of each membrane in the structure
is dominated by the mechanical properties along the shorter side of
the rectangle.

Polarization-Dependent Raman Spectroscopy
We have studied
the anisotropy of arsenic trisulfide in detail by polarization-dependent
Raman spectroscopy39 at λ = 488,
514, and 632 nm of a laser excitation (see SI 7). At λ = 632 nm the measured Raman spectrum shows at
least eight vibrational modes: seven symmetric (A1) and
one asymmetric (B2) (Figure 2a) with respect to rotations around the principal axis,
corresponding to a C2v7 point group symmetry
of a single As2S3 layer.40,41 These could be related to a C2h point group symmetry of the bulk crystal through a correlation
table.40−43 The intensity of Raman modes depends on the linear polarization
angle of incident light in a backscattering Raman setup. As shown
in Figure 2d–f,
A1 (154 and 202 cm–1), Raman modes have
the largest intensity when the light polarization is aligned along
the a-axis, while the A1 (309 cm–1) mode has the maximum intensity along the c-axis.40−43 We explain this behavior using group theory and Raman tensor calculations,
assuming Placzek approximation (see SI 3), which produces a good fit to the measured data (Figure 2d–f). The frequency
of Raman phonons did not depend on the measured flake thickness, although
the intensity of the signal decreased accordingly (Figure 2c). We used this polarization-dependent
Raman mode to determine the exact crystalline orientation for flakes
of thicknesses down to 8 nm. At a smaller number of layers (e.g., 2 nm of thickness) the signal of
the Si from the substrate starts to dominate the spectra. We have
also performed photodegradation tests by analyzing the Raman spectrum
of the 354–358 cm–1 modes under a set of
laser powers. Although As2S3 is known to transmit
infrared well,19 approaching the band gap
of the material (∼2.6 eV21,46) with excessive light
can convert the crystal to its amorphous state,47 thus locally destroying the crystallinity of the flake
(see SI 1). Taking this into account, we
further used flakes of thicknesses t > 8 nm and
a
corresponding low power of the incident laser light to minimize damage
to the suspended As2S3 membranes.

Anisotropy in the Static Mechanical Properties
The
strong asymmetry of the crystalline structure of As2S3 along the a- and c-axes
(Figure 1b,c) is also
expected to cause a large anisotropy in the Young’s modulus
of the material.48 We have studied the
mechanical anisotropy in the Young’s modulus as a function
of angle by AFM using the star-shaped configuration shown in Figure 3a. With an AFM tip
of calibrated stiffness we indent the As2S3 membranes
suspended over star-shaped trenches and record the force–deflection
curve at the center of each of the 12 membranes of the same flake.
The high aspect ratio of the rectangular membranes, b ≫ a is chosen such that the slope of the
force–deflection curve is dominated by the effective Young’s
modulus, Eeff, along the shortest side
of the rectangle. As shown in Figure 3b, a difference in deflection, δ, was achieved
for an equal force applied, F. Assuming a point force
deflection at the center of the cavity, we obtain the following equation
for the force–distance relation of the rectangular membrane
(see SI 4): 1  where α(a, b), C2(a, b), and c0(a, b) are geometry-dependent factors
and N0 is the intrinsic pretension. Using
Poisson’s
ratio ν2 = 0.094,49,50 we fit eq 1 to the data and extract
effective Young’s moduli along the set of angles to the crystalline
axes. We take into account measured thickness variations as determined
by AFM, which are found to be at most one to two single layers (as
seen in Figure 3a),
to extract correct values of Eeff. Figure 3c shows the characteristic
dumbbell shape of angle-resolved effective Young’s moduli,
which is a typical example of mechanical anisotropy in layered materials.16 We also measure Raman spectra along the hard
and soft axis of the crystal to connect the observed anisotropy in
mechanical properties to the crystalline orientation (Figure 3d). The dependence of Eeff on the rotation angle, θ, in a particular
direction is defined from Hooke’s law, taking into the account Ea, Ec, and an effective shear, Geff (see SI 5):16 2

Young’s modulus along a and c crystalline axes measured for the best five samples of various thickness
(from 9 to 25 nm).

From the fits of eq 2 to the data in Figure 3c,e we obtain Ea = 79.1
± 10.1 GPa, Ec =
47.2 ± 7.9 GPa, and Geff = 28.0 ±
2.5 GPa, so that the ratio of the mechanical anisotropy is  (Figure 3e). These
values are also consistent with additional
measurements done on synthetically grown As2S3 showing that effect of possible defects and stacking faults on mechanical
anisotropy in natural As2S3 crystals is insignificant
(see SI 6).

Dynamic Mechanical Properties
When As2S3 is suspended over a rectangular
hole made in a Si/SiO2 substrate, it forms a resonator.
We use the light intensity
modulation by the motion of the membrane to measure the resonance
frequencies in a laser interferometer. A schematic of the setup is
shown in Figure 4a.
Here, the modulated blue diode laser is used to optothermally drive
the As2S3 membrane and the red laser to read
out its motion.51 This allowed us to observe
a significant shift in the resonance frequency of the fundamental
mode, f0(θ), at θ = 90°
to the hard axis (a-axis) of the crystal (Figure 4b). We were also
able to resolve the natural mode frequency as a function of crystalline
orientation of a membrane and compare it to the effective Young’s
modulus extracted for the same flake with the force–deflection
AFM measurements. As shown in Figure 4c, the ratio of anisotropy measures  in the dynamic experiment, which is comparable
to  found from the static deflection
of the
same flake. This confirms the significant effect of anisotropy in
the Young’s modulus on the mechanical response of the membranes.

frequency response of rectangular resonators rotated by 90° with
respect to the a-axis. (c) Comparison of anisotropic
response observed in motion (laser interferometry, black) and statics
(AFM force-indention, red).

We further investigated the evolution of higher modes of thick
rectangular As2S3 resonators as a function of
the angle to the crystalline axis. We transferred a 129 ± 3 nm
thick flake, as measured by tapping mode AFM, over a set of rectangular
cavities with a b:a = 2:1 side ratio
(Figure 5b). This aspect
ratio results in mode crossings52 at certain
angles, θ, and a more complex frequency dependence on angle
for higher modes.53 In Figure 5a,c the solid lines show the
results of a finite element method (FEM) model obtained using the
COMSOL Multiphysics package of the first six modes of a clamped As2S3 plate resonator. The model matches experimental
data well (Figure 5a and c) for the first four modes. Note that no fitting parameters
were used, with only the thickness measured from AFM and elastic constants48 of As2S3 added as an input
to the FEM simulations. For higher modes we observe a discrepancy
between the measured position of the resonance peak and the model,
which could be due to a larger sensitivity of higher modes to perturbations
and imperfections of the system.51 We show
six modes obtained from FEM simulation together with five experimentally
detected modes in Figure 5c to emphasize that the highest measured mode could not be
precisely identified but is likely to be related to either the fifth
or sixth mode of the resonator. Interestingly, as can be seen in Figure 5a, an avoided crossing
is expected when the long side of the rectangular membrane with b/a = 2 aspect ratio makes an angle of
40° with respect to the c-axis of the crystal.
This unique feature could be potentially used in further studies of
strong intrinsic coupling and internal resonances between modes in
rectangular resonators of different ratio of sides.52

Conclusions
In conclusion, we combined optical and
mechanical characterization
techniques to obtain a comprehensive picture of the in-plane anisotropy
in arsenic trisulfide. Using polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy
and force–deflection AFM in a star-shaped geometry of rectangular
cavities, we systematically characterized the mechanical anisotropy
in a few layers of this van der Waals crystal and relate that to its
crystalline structure and orientation. We showed quantitatively that
the anisotropy in the Young’s modulus of As2S3 is close to that of black phosphorus, which is currently
known to have the largest in-plane  ratio among 2D crystals.15 We also demonstrated that this results in a
large orientation-specific
change in the resonance frequency of higher vibrational modes in As2S3 resonators. These mechanical properties make
As2S3 an interesting alternative to black phosphorus
for applications in flexible strain-dependent optoelectronical devices,20 while stability in air makes it a promising
material for further integration into optomechanical nanodevices as
well as for research of anisotropic nonlinear mechanics in the 2D
limit. We also believe that, due to its high flexibility48−50 and pronounced optoelectronic properties,38,46 As2S3 has perspectives to find applications
in atomically thin optical waveplates12 and to become an interesting candidate material for polarization-sensitive
flexible photoconductors22,23 and acousto-optic modulators.24

Methods
Sample Fabrication
A prepatterning on a Si/SiO2 (285 nm) chip was implemented
by reactive ion etching (RIE),
and edges were examined to be well-defined by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and AFM. Flakes of As2S3 were exfoliated
from a matrix crystal mined in Senduchen, Sakha Republic, Russia.
Thin flakes of As2S3 were transferred on a prepatterned
chip by an all-dry viscoelastic stamping method.28

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
studies were
performed on a Horiba Scientific LabRAM HR at an excitation of λred = 632 nm, λgreen = 514 nm, and λblue = 488 nm in a backscattering geometry in parallel-polarized
configuration, (ei ∥ es) with a 360° rotational sample stage. All measurements
were performed away from the suspended region.

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM scans and inspections were
performed in tapping mode on a Bruker Dimension FastScan AFM. Cantilevers
were chosen to have a tip radius of ∼7–10 nm, as confirmed
by SEM imaging. Using thermal and solid surface deflection calibration
we estimated the spring constant, k, for each cantilever.
We use cantilevers with spring constants of k = 30–40
N/m for thicker flakes (>12 nm) and k = 8–9
N/m for thinner ones (<12 nm). Each data point on the polar diagram
in Figure 3a is an
averaged value from fitting three to five force–deflection
curves obtained at the same position.

Laser Interferometry
The sample is mounted on a motorized xy nanopositioning
stage inside a vacuum chamber with optical
access. A modulated diode laser (λ = 405 nm) was used to excite
the membrane optothermally and drive it into motion. An interferometric
displacement detection is then obtained by focusing a He–Ne
laser beam (λ = 632 nm) on the suspended membrane while recording
the interfering reflections from the membrane and the Si substrate
underneath using a photodiode. Laser spot size is on the order of
∼1 μm. The photodiode signal is processed by a vector
network analyzer. The pressure inside the vacuum chamber is kept stable
at ∼1 × 10–6 mbar.
