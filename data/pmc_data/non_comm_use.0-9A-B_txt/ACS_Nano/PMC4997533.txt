In
this work, we study the reinforcement of polymers by mechanically
interlocked derivatives of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).
We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of polymers and
of composites with pristine SWNTs, mechanically interlocked derivatives
of SWNTs (MINTs), and the corresponding supramolecular models. Improvements
of both Young’s modulus and tensile strength of up to 200%
were observed for the polystyrene–MINT samples with an optimized
loading of just 0.01 wt %, while the supramolecular models with identical
chemical composition and loading showed negligible or even detrimental
influence. This behavior is found for three different types of SWNTs
and two types of macrocycles. Molecular dynamics simulations show
that the polymer adopts an elongated conformation parallel to the
SWNT when interacting with MINT fillers, irrespective of the macrocycle
chemical nature, whereas a more globular structure is taken upon facing
with either pristine SWNTs or supramolecular models. The MINT composite
architecture thus leads to a more efficient exploitation of the axial
properties of the SWNTs and of the polymer chain at the interface,
in agreement with experimental results. Our findings demonstrate that
the mechanical bond imparts distinctive advantageous properties to
SWNT derivatives as polymer fillers.

==== Body
Carbon nanotubes are extensively
used as reinforcing fillers in composites due to their extraordinary
mechanical and structural properties. Since the report in this field
by Ajayan et al.,1 several
materials where the mechanical and/or electrical properties of polymers
have been significantly improved through nanotubes fillers have been
demonstrated and used for different applications,2−16 including improved batteries, mechanically reinforced materials,17,18 and sensors.19,20

To fully exploit the properties
of single-wall carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) as fillers in polymer matrices, a lot of research has been
directed toward their chemical modification. In this framework, the
mechanical bond is very attractive due to its dynamic features,21,22 which have allowed for the construction of artificial molecular
machines.23−30 The mechanical bond is also very relevant for polymer science: polyrotaxanes,
polycatenanes, and supramolecular polymers including mechanically
interlocked molecules have all been investigated.31−39 The reinforcement effect of B/SiOx nanocomposites through the formation
of interlocked “necklaces” has also been described.40,41

The mechanical link was recently introduced by some of us
as a
tool for the chemical manipulation of SWNTs.42−45 We used a U-shaped precursor
featuring two units of a recognition element for SWNTs connected through
an aromatic spacer and further decorated with alkene-terminated alkyl
spacers of different lengths. Using pyrene and π-extended derivatives
of tetrathiafulvalene, both of which have high affinity for SWNTs,46−49 we could template the ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of the U-shaped
precursor around the nanotubes, forming mechanically interlocked derivatives
of SWNTs (MINTs, Figure 1a). Thanks to the extreme aspect ratio of the nanotubes, which prevents
dissociation of the macrocycles from the nanotubes once they are formed
around them, MINTs showed stability comparable to that of covalently
modified nanotubes while maintaining the native structure of the SWNTs.
Since rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes are both topologically identical,50,51 and the major difference between them is their kinetic stability,52 we believe our MINT derivatives can be considered
mechanically interlocked despite the lack of explicit stoppers.

run in air at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. All Raman spectra are the average of 10 different measurements
at λexc = 785 nm.

To effectively transfer the anisotropic properties of elongated
fillers such as SWNTs to composites, a parallel orientation in the
matrix and a strong interaction with the polymer are required. In
principle, the parallel orientation along the prevalent direction
of macromolecular chains can be favored by electrospinning, due to
the very high elongational strain rates applied,53−55 while the noncovalent
interactions between polymer and filler can be tuned chemically. Recently,
the groups led by Pisignano and Credi have described that various
dynamic properties of rotaxane-type molecules are conserved within
electrospun fibers.56

Here, we present
our results on the influence of the mechanical
bond on the mechanical properties of SWNT-based nanocomposites. We
incorporate MINTs in polystyrene fibers and study their tensile properties.
The merits of the MINT functionalization approach manifest as substantial
enhancements in Young’s modulus and tensile strength. In comparison,
noninterlocked model samples of identical chemical composition show
no positive effect.

Results and Discussion
We utilized
two types of macrocycles (Figure 1b) and three types of SWNTs of different
diameters, lengths, and electronic character. In particular, we used
pyrene- (1) and exTTF-based (2) macrocycles
and (6,5)-enriched nanotubes (0.7–0.9 nm in diameter, length
≥700 nm, mostly semiconducting, 95% purity) denoted as (6,5)-SWNTs,
plasma-purified SWNTs (pp-SWNTs 0.8–1.6 nm in diameter, length
3–30 μm, mostly metallic, 99% purity), and shorter COOH
functionalized SWNTs (o-SWNTs 0.8–1.6 nm in diameter, length
0.5–2.0 μm, mostly metallic, 99% purity). These various
types of samples allowed us to discriminate mechanical reinforcement
arising from differences in SWNT length or dispersion quality from
those directly due to the MINT functionalization.

The general
method for the synthesis of MINTs has been reported
elsewhere.42−45 Briefly, we use a clipping strategy in which a suspension of SWNTs
is treated with the adequate bis-alkene U-shape precursor and Grubbs’
second-generation catalyst. After supramolecular association of the
U-shape, it can be closed around the SWNT to form MINTs. Noninterlocked
macrocycles and U-shapes, oligomers, catalyst, and all other byproducts
are removed by extensive washes with dichloromethane. The interlocked
macrocycles stay in place without the need for “stoppers”
due to the extreme aspect ratio of the SWNTs. All samples used in
this study were adequately characterized by standard methods, including
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman, UV–vis–NIR,
and TEM. Figure 1 shows
representative examples of TGA curves, Raman spectra, and TEM micrographs.
TGA evidence indicated that, following MINT-forming reaction, the
SWNTs showed organic functionalization between 27 and 43%, remaining
stable even after reflux in tetrachloroethane for 30 min. No major
shifts and no increase in the ID/IG ratio upon functionalization were found in
the Raman spectra, confirming that the functionalization is noncovalent.
HRTEM allows visualization of individual macrocycles around the SWNTs
in the MINT samples (for comprehensive characterization, including
control experiments, see the Supporting Information and refs (42−45)).

We prepared suspensions
of the SWNT derivatives through ultrasonication.
To avoid the presence of aggregates that could affect the mechanical
properties, the suspensions were centrifuged and then polystyrene
was added. Electrospinning was carried out using a commercially available
system, operating with an applied interelectrode bias of 14 kV and
a flow rate of 1 mL h–1. The filler loading was
optimized to 0.01 wt % respect to polystyrene, since larger loadings
lead to defective fibers (Supporting Information). With this loading, fibers showed seamless and uniform surfaces,
without discernible beads or nanotube aggregates. Figure 2 displays typical scanning
electron (SEM) micrographs of fibers made of pristine polystyrene
and of those with o-SWNT-based fillers as representative examples
(other samples are shown in the Supporting Information).

Figure 2 SEM images of (a) polystyrene fibers; (b) o-SWNTs; (c) MINT(o)–1; (d) o-SWNTs·1.
Inset scale: 10 μm.

The diameter distribution of the fibers is within the same
range
of 1.3–1.8 μm for all samples (Figure S7). Pristine polystyrene fibers are slightly thicker (2.2
± 0.6 μm) as expected because of the lower solution conductivity.57 The (6,5)-SWNTs and pp-SWNTs samples are similar
to o-SWNTs in structure and size as shown in Figure S8. The mechanical properties of the fibers were then determined
using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA). Each nanocomposite (n = 3 specimens) was cut into 1 × 4 cm2 pieces
to define samples with thickness 0.15–0.18 mm. All samples
had comparable area density (ca. 2.5 mg cm–2), and
thus, the test specimens had similar linear densities too, ensuring
stable force to stress normalization in the measurements. Force–displacement
curves were recorded at 1 N min–1 (up to 18 N).

Figure 3 displays
stress/strain curves for reference polystyrene (gray) and the nanocomposites
explored: with pristine SWNTs (black), SWNTs + macrocycle supramolecular
complex (blue), and MINT (red) for all types of SWNTs. The MINT samples
present substantially higher modulus, yield, and tensile strengths
than all control samples. Interestingly, in the supramolecular systems,
the macrocycle reduces dramatically both modulus and strength, suggesting
that it acts as a plasticizer that weakens the SWNT/matrix interface.
The traditional composite has similar tensile properties to the pure
polystyrene matrix, including ductility. The implication is that at
this low volume fraction even pure SWNTs are well dispersed, for otherwise
in aggregated form they would most likely act as defects that would
reduce ductility. This supports the view that the improvement in mechanical
reinforcement obtained using the MINT strategy is due to a more efficient
stress transfer across the SWNT/polymer interface (vide infra). The Young’s moduli and tensile strengths of all samples
are displayed in Figure 4 and Table S1.

General trends are clearly evidenced. First, the mechanical
properties
of fibers are only slightly reinforced by pristine SWNTs fillers.
Second, the use of MINTs leads instead to a significant improvement
of both the Young’s modulus and the tensile strength in all
samples, irrespective of the type of nanotube or macrocycle. Lastly,
the supramolecular fillers have negligible or even detrimental effects
on the mechanical properties of the polystyrene fibers. For instance,
the samples in which pristine (6,5)-SWNTs were used as fillers showed
a Young’s modulus of 18 ± 1 MPa and a tensile strength
of 1.26 ± 0.06 MPa, whereas the pure polystyrene fibers showed
15 ± 1 and 1.09 ± 0.03 MPa, respectively. In contrast, the
MINT(6,5)–1 samples showed 32 ±
6 MPa and 2.0 ± 0.3 MPa, which is a remarkable improvement of
110% in the Young’s modulus and of 80% in the tensile strength.
Meanwhile, the supramolecular filler (6,5)-SWNTs·1 yielded 7 ± 1 MPa and 0.39 ± 0.03 MPa as Young’s
modulus and tensile strength, respectively, which implies a variation
of −53% in the Young’s modulus and of −64% in
the tensile strength with respect to the pristine polymer.

The
trends for macrocycle 2 are identical, although
with quantitatively smaller effects. In the case of pristine pp-SWNTs,
we observed no significant variation in the Young’s modulus
and a decrease of −50% in the tensile strength with respect
to polystyrene. Meanwhile, the MINT(pp)–1 and MINT(pp)–2 fillers showed an
increase of 130% and 230% in the Young’s modulus and 170% and
106% in the tensile strength, respectively. The supramolecular models
showed very small improvements in the case of macrocycle 1 and slightly detrimental effects for macrocycle 2.

Finally, for the pristine o-SWNT-filled samples, the variation
in Young’s modulus with respect to polystyrene is 53% and only
8% in tensile strength. Again, the mechanically interlocked samples
lead to a well-defined improvement, offering 130% and 290% variations
in Young’s modulus and 140% and 240% increase in tensile strength
for MINT(o)–1 and MINT(o)–2, respectively. Just like with the other types of nanotubes, the
supramolecular fillers offered no improvements in the mechanical properties
over pure polystyrene.

No significant changes were observed
in the strain-to-break among
samples with the same kind of nanotubes (Figure 4c).

Complex effects could be responsible
for the improvement observed
in the mechanical properties of the composites, including nanoscale
friction at the polymer–nanocarbon interface.58,59 In order to gain atomic understanding of our system, molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were performed using the AMBER force field,60 which accounts for dispersion interactions.
To mimic our experimental conditions as much as possible, MD calculations
were carried out using a (6,5)-SWNT of 400 atoms to ensure the same
SWNT/macrocycle ratio measured experimentally. The polystyrene fiber
consisted of 36 residues, which were introduced in a fully extended
conformation to emulate the electrospinning conditions. Initial configuration
of the composites and computational details are described in the Supporting Information. Figure 5 shows the equilibrated structures of polystyrene
and its composites with SWNTs, SWNT·1, SWNT·2, MINT–1 and MINT–2. Due to the flexible backbone, after 0.4 ns a highly twisted, globular
structure is adopted to maximize intramolecular interactions (Figure 5a). A similar picture
dominates the first frames of the simulations with the nanotube fillers,
until polymer–nanotube intermolecular interactions become relevant.
Upon stabilization (after approximately 2 ns of simulation time, see
the Supporting Information), we observe
very clear differences between the various fillers. The pristine nanotubes
allow polystyrene to adopt a globular structure, very similar to that
found for pure polystyrene (Figure 5b). In the supramolecular controls, the fiber tries
to maximize short contacts with both macrocycle and SWNT, which results
in a slightly more distorted structure (Figure 5c,d). Finally, in the MINT samples the positioning
of the macrocycles around the nanotubes results in less surface available
for interaction with the polystyrene fiber, which reacts by adopting
a significantly more extended conformation in order to maximize noncovalent
interactions with the SWNT (Figures 5e and 5f). As a quantitative
metric for these observations, we measured the dihedral angles of
the polystyrene backbone for each case for a total of 500 frames in
the last nanosecond of our simulation (Figure 5g). An average of around 130° is found
for the MINTs, compared to an average of 95° for the supramolecular
compounds and approximately 105° for the polymer-SWNT model.
The extended conformation of polystyrene according to MD simulations
is more pronounced in the case of MINT–1 when
compared to MINT–2, while the results for the
supramolecular models are fundamentally independent of the structure
of the macrocycle, in direct correlation with experimental results.
Polymer-chain extension and orientation are established prerequisites
to produce strong/stiff polymeric materials, for example, in the form
of high-performance fibers.61,62 The MINT-induced polymer
conformation extracted from MD simulations is in line with such arrangement
and agrees with the higher degree of reinforcement observed for MINT-containing
composites.

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that mechanical interlocking
is a strategy
to optimize the performance of SWNT fillers with regard to their mechanical
properties. Very low loading of 0.01% results in improvement of the
Young’s modulus and tensile strength of the fibers of over
200%. In comparison, fillers with identical chemical composition but
lacking the interlocked architectures showed negligible or even detrimental
effects. Moreover, by using up to three different kinds of nanotubes,
two macrocycles, and the corresponding supramolecular controls, we
have demonstrated that the positive effect is general to the MINT
samples, as the trends hold in all cases under study. MD simulations
show that this effect originates from a superior ability of the MINT
fillers to induce extended conformation in the polystyrene fibers,
which allows for an optimized transfer of stress between matrix and
SWNTs.

Experimental Methods
(6,5)-Enriched
nanotubes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (0.7–0.9
nm in diameter, length ≥700 nm, mostly semiconducting, 95%
purity), plasma-purified SWNTs (pp-SWNTs) were purchased from Cheap
Tubes, Inc. (0.8–1.6 nm in diameter, length 3–30 μm,
mostly metallic, 99% purity), and COOH-functionalized SWNTs (o-SWNTs)
were purchased from Cheap Tubes, Inc. (0.8–1.6 nm in diameter,
length 0.5–2.0 μm, mostly metallic, 99% purity). Electrospinning
was carried out using a commercially available Spraybase electrospinning
system. TGA was performed using a TA Instruments TGAQ500 with a ramp
of 10 °C/min under air from 100 to 1000 °C. SEM micrographs
were obtained in a Zeiss EVO HD15 operating at 5 kV. UV–vis
spectra were obtained in a Varian Cary 50 UV–vis. Mechanical
properties were determined using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA
Q800, TA Instruments). Each fiber sample (n = 3 specimens)
was cut in 1 cm × 4 cm rectangular shapes with thicknesses between
0.15 and 0.18 mm. Stress–strain curves were recorded at a rate
of 1 N min–1 (up to 18 N).

Linear receptors
and MINTs were synthesized as described in refs (42−45). The nanotubes (10 mg) were suspended in 10 mL of tetrachloroethane
through sonication (10 min) and mixed with linear precursors 1 and 2 (0.01 mmol) and Grubbs’ second-generation
catalyst at room temperature for 72 h. After this time, the suspension
was filtered through a PTFE membrane of 0.2 μm pore size and
the solid washed profusely with dichloromethane (DCM). The solid was
resuspended in 10 mL of DCM through sonication for 10 min and filtered
through a PTFE membrane of 0.2 μm pore size again. This washing
procedure was repeated three times.

Composites were prepared
by direct suspension of MINTs or pristine
nanotubes in dimethylformamide by sonication at 20 °C for 12
h, and the suspensions were centrifuged at 13150g for 15 min to obtain stable suspensions following the addition of
polystyrene (Mw average 350000) 30% (w/w)
and stirring for 12 h. In the case of supramolecular samples, pristine
nanotubes were suspended under the same conditions, preformed macrocycles
were added before polystyrene, and the mixture was stirred for 12
h. Concentrations of SWNTs, MINTs, and supramolecular models were
matched using UV–vis spectra at 450 nm of the suspension obtained.
The prepared solutions were added to a syringe and pumped at 1 mL
h–1 with a voltage of 14 kV and constant temperature
and humidity. All samples were electrospun over a 10 cm diameter round
collector to obtain randomly aligned fibers.
