Many theoretical
studies predict that DNA sequencing should be
feasible by monitoring the transverse current through a graphene nanoribbon
while a DNA molecule translocates through a nanopore in that ribbon.
Such a readout would benefit from the special transport properties
of graphene, provide ultimate spatial resolution because of the single-atom
layer thickness of graphene, and facilitate high-bandwidth measurements.
Previous experimental attempts to measure such transverse inplane
signals were however dominated by a trivial capacitive response. Here,
we explore the feasibility of the approach using a custom-made differential
current amplifier that discriminates between the capacitive current
signal and the resistive response in the graphene. We fabricate well-defined
short and narrow (30 nm × 30 nm) nanoribbons with a 5 nm nanopore
in graphene with a high-temperature scanning transmission electron
microscope to retain the crystallinity and sensitivity of the graphene.
We show that, indeed, resistive modulations can be observed in the
graphene current due to DNA translocation through the nanopore, thus
demonstrating that DNA sensing with inplane currents in graphene nanostructures
is possible. The approach is however exceedingly challenging due to
low yields in device fabrication connected to the complex multistep
device layout.

Nanopores
have proven to be
powerful biomolecular sensors as they allow detection and characterization
of even single molecules solely via an electronic
readout with no need for amplification or labels. In nanopore sensing,
the molecule of interest is pulled by an electric field through a
nanometer-sized hole in a thin membrane in a head-to-tail fashion
while structural features of the molecule can be consecutively read.1 The traversal of a DNA molecule leads to a blockade
in the ionic current through the nanopore that is monitored, that
is, what is commonly measured as the sensing signal. DNA sequencing
using biological nanopores within a lipid membrane has successfully
been shown2 and recently even commercialized.3,4

Solid-state nanopores5 present
some
advantages over biological pores, such as their robustness, thermal,
mechanical, and chemical versatility, and potential for device integration
in wafer-scale integrated circuits.6 Whereas
solid-state nanopores have enabled numerous interesting biophysics
studies of proteins and nucleic acids,7,8 calling individual
bases along a DNA molecule traversing through such a nanopore—a
prerequisite for sequencing—remains to be shown yet. Conventional
solid-state nanopores suffer from poor spatial resolution, as the
length of these nanopores is set by the thickness of the membranes
used, typically 10–30 nm, resulting in an ionic current blockade
that is constituted by ∼100 bases that collectively reside
in the pore. For that reason, the use of a two-dimensional membrane
material, such as graphene, is clearly appealing, as only one or a
few bases can occupy the pore volume at the same time. Various attempts
have been reported on the use of graphene and related layered materials
to probe DNA, with partial success.9−20 Individual DNA molecules could well be distinguished but challenges
remain. For example, detailed features were hard to resolve because
the ionic currents through these nanopores exhibited high levels of
1/f-noise.21 Furthermore, the fast translocation
speed of the DNA molecules (0.01–1 μs/base) sets a need
for >MHz sampling rates, at which the noise is too high to resolve
the blockade signals, let alone sequence information.

Since
graphene is a conducting material,22 an
interesting alternative to the ionic-current readout is the measurement
of the transverse (i.e., perpendicular
to the DNA molecule) current through a graphene nanoribbon with a
nanopore through that ribbon, see Figure 1a. Many theoretical and computational studies
on transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and graphene quantum point
contacts with a nanopore have shown that the presence of the DNA bases
inside the nanopore can lead to base-specific modulations in the electronic
current through the graphene nanostructure, thus in principle enabling
measurement of the DNA sequence as the molecule passes through the
nanopore.23−34 These studies show that non-electrostatic base-specific interactions
between the DNA bases and the graphene nanoribbon result in alterations
of the local density of states around the nanopore leading to resistive
changes of the nanoribbon that can be measured in the inplane current
running through the ribbon. An important advantage of this approach
is the relatively large current magnitude in these nanoribbons (μA)
and the flat frequency response to high megahertz frequencies,35,36 facilitating high-bandwidth measurements, that is, opening up
the possibility to sequence at the translocation speed that is typically
observed with solid-state nanopores.

Figure 1 Transverse current measurement for DNA
detection. (a) Concept of
the experiment: Both the inplane current through a graphene nanoribbon
and an ionic current through the nanopore are measured, while a DNA
molecule translocates through a nanopore in that ribbon. (b) Schematic
representation (not to scale) of the device (top) and measurement
setup (bottom). A silicon chip with a silicon nitride membrane and
platinum electrodes acts as substrate for the graphene nanoribbon,
which is covered by a top-layer of h-BN, with a nanopore drilled through
the BN/graphene stack. The graphene nanoribbon is exposed to the liquid
on the trans side (bottom). In the experiment, both the ionic current
through a nanopore and the graphene transverse electronic current
are measured. The ionic voltage probes that are used to drag the DNA
through the nanopore are concurrently used to gate the nanostructure.
(c) With the liquid gate, the potential of the graphene can be sweeped
such that the Dirac curve is obtained, revealing the ambipolar nature
of the charge carriers in graphene. The DC operating point of the
graphene device can be tuned to the left wing of the Dirac curve (star),
representing negative transconductance, and to the right wing (circle),
representing positive transconductance value. Three different types
of signals can be measured: (d) Capacitive signals, which will always
be of the same sign and will be independent of the Fermi level of
the graphene. (e) Electrostatic interactions either due to the negative
charge of the DNA backbone or due to a potential change at the nanopore
caused by DNA translocation. These will result in different signals
on both sides of the Dirac curve: A current increase when the current
is carried by holes (left wing), and a current decrease when electrons
are the dominant carriers (right wing). (f) Current fluctuations due
to non-electrostatic local interactions between the DNA bases and
the graphene nanopore, which can lead to current enhancements or decreases.
The question mark denotes that the sign of this signal is not a priori known, as different theories predict different
outcomes, depending on device parameters.

A simplified schematic of the proposed experiment is presented
in the Figure 1b. The
traversal of DNA through a nanopore in a graphene nanoribbon is monitored
by the inplane current measurement. The voltage that is applied to
the ionic current electrodes to drive DNA through the nanopore simultaneously acts
as an electrolytic gate that modulates the current through the graphene
nanoribbon. The graphene current dependence on the gate voltage, the
so-called Dirac curve (Figure 1c), yields the transconductance gm that indicates the sensitivity of the graphene conductance
to external voltage fluctuations. Similar approaches have been reported
before with wider graphene nanoribbons37,38 and silicon
nanowires39 for DNA detection. Importantly,
the current signals measured with these systems were shown to originate
in a capacitive coupling of the potential change at the nanopore that
occurs during DNA translocation to the local capacitance of the sensor
at the nanopore.39 These capacitive signals
were studied in detail and were shown to increase with smaller pore
diameters and thinner membranes and can be maximized through the introduction
of a buffer salt gradient.37−41 Importantly, while this capacitive signal reveals the local presence
of DNA in the nanopore, it does not represent the theoretically predicted
resistive modulation in the graphene current discussed above. In this
study, we aim to elucidate whether or not it is feasible to measure
a non-capacitive response of DNA translocations in the transverse
current through a graphene nanoribbon.

What signals can be expected
in the graphene transverse current
due to the presence of DNA in the nanopore? We distinguish between
three different types of signals, which are schematically shown in Figure 1d–f. First,
as mentioned above, we expect to measure a capacitive signal (Figure 1d), which is expected
to be similar irrespective of the choice of the DC operating point
on the Dirac curve (indicated by * and • in Figure 1c), and its magnitude should
be independent of the bias voltage applied to the graphene.38 This signal can be defined as , where ΔVl the local potential change at the nanopore
due to
DNA translocation, Δt the time scale over which
this change is realized, and Cg the capacitance of the graphene to the electrolyte at the
nanopore. Second, we expect that electrostatic interactions will modify
the Fermi level of the graphene nanostructure (Figure 1e). Current modulations will depend on the
type of carriers, where transport dominated by holes will lead to
negative transconductance gm (left wing of Dirac curve in Figure 1c), and transport dominated by electrons
will result in positive transconductance gm (right wing of Dirac curve in Figure 1c). This electrostatic signal can be defined
as Ie = gmΔVe, where ΔVe is a potential change that can have two possible origins.
The first originates in the negative charge of the DNA backbone , where Qeff is the
effective charge of the DNA.42 Second,
a contribution ΔVe,2 = ΔVl due to
a local potential change is evoked by a perturbation in the
electric field at the nanopore due to insertion of DNA into the nanopore,
as already mentioned above.39 Third, we
expect current signals due to non-electrostatic DNA base-graphene
interactions (Figure 1f). As calculated in a great number of theoretical reports,23−34 the presence of a DNA base can lead to substantial current modulations
that increase with the bias voltage applied to the graphene. However,
the magnitude and sign of the current change that is induced depend
on multiple factors, including the width of the structure, the position
and size of the nanopore, the edge structure of the ribbon (zigzag
or armchair), and the Fermi level of the graphene, and is therefore
not known a priori.

The particular size of
the graphene nanostructure that probes the
presence of the DNA in the nanopore is of great importance. While
previous theoretical work focused on sub-10 nm wide ribbons, early
experiments probed the transport only for 600–1000 nm long
and 50–200 nm wide ribbons.37,38 Here we measure
on short and narrow graphene nanoribbons (minimum width w) to maximize the sensitivity for effects near the nanopore. We also
argue that short ribbon lengths (L) are beneficial,
because long ribbons are more prone to edge damage. Previous studies
have shown that roughness and disorder along the edges may result
in transport that is characterized by a series of quantum dots rather
than by a single nanoribbon.43,44 In addition, shorter
nanoribbons feature a higher conductance. Therefore, we realized short
and narrow nanoribbons of 30 × 30 nm that were as small as experimentally
feasible while explicitly also striving for a minimal amount of defects,
which is non-trivial since most top-down patterning strategies (e.g., focused ion beams or etching/e-beam
lithography)43 lead to defect layers of
tens of nanometers near the edges.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication
Workflow and Device Characterization
We
first describe the extensive fabrication protocol of our devices.
The workflow is indicated in Figure 2a. Device fabrication is started with a wafer of silicon
chips, with 500 nm-thick SiN membranes containing embedded platinum
heaters. We spraycoated e-beam resist from the backside and employed
through-membrane e-beam lithography, to RIE etch 5 × 5 μm
windows of 100 nm thickness in the silicon nitride membranes.45 Platinum electrodes were deposited on top of
the membranes, in which we patterned 400 nm holes (panel i in Figure 2a) to suspend graphene,
which later enables sculpting of freestanding graphene. An exfoliated
graphene flake (typically 10 × 10 μm) is transferred on
top of the SiN membrane (panel ii). Subsequently, the graphene is
patterned using e-beam lithography and oxygen plasma etching into
a 200 × 200 nm square with four leads that each contact a platinum
electrode (panel iii). This layout ensures that currents run nowhere
else than through the graphene nanostructure. Then, a 30 × 30
nm graphene nanoribbon is sculpted using high-temperature STEM at
300–600 °C with high precision46 (panel iv). At such high temperatures, carbon adatoms knocked out
by the e-beam or originating from C-rich contaminations in the environment
diffuse at high rates and instantly reoccupy vacancies in the graphene
lattice, preventing carbon deposition and, importantly, preserving
the crystallinity of the graphene.47 The
bottom row in Figure 2a presents an example of the consecutive sculpting steps performed
in the STEM, where the graphene (gray) can be distinguished from vacuum
(black). An automated script is used to move the electron beam along
predefined paths to make cutting lines (see Methods section for details), visualized by the dark lines in the STEM images.
In between the sculpting, we switch to imaging for which we use a
fast scanning e-beam with short dwell times (μs) to be able
to correct for drift in the microscope. A thin flake (3–7 layers)
of h-BN is subsequently transferred on top of the nanoribbon as a
support and, more importantly, to represent the membrane for the nanopore
experiments, that is, to enforce the DNA to translocate through the
nanopore and not next to the sides of the graphene square. To prevent
parasitic electrochemical currents during the nanopore measurements,
a thick (1.5 μm) layer of polyimide is placed on top of the
stack to coat the electrodes (panel vi). A 5 × 5 μm area
is exposed using e-beam lithography, such that after development a
circular area with a diameter of approximately 10 μm at the
nanostructure uncovered. Finally, a 5 nm nanopore is drilled with
STEM at the center of the nanoribbon-BN stack (panel vii). Note that,
using STEM imaging, the graphene can still be distinguished from the
h-BN.

the sequential patterning steps. Bottom: STEM images of a single nanoribbon
device, where gray represents the graphene and black is vacuum. In
the second image, the cutting lines that are to be made with STEM
are marked with a red dotted line. When the cutting lines are subsequently
connected, the graphene is removed. After the BN transfer, some wrinkles
of the h-BN flake are visible. After the polyimide patterning, a 5
nm nanopore is drilled through the stack of graphene and h-BN. (b)
Example of a current–voltage measurement. (c) Ribbon resistances
as measured directly after sculpting at room temperature. We find
an average resistance of 194 ± 35 kΩ (±s.e.m.) (indicated
by the vertical red line), deduced from 51 ribbons. (d) Conductivity
of the graphene nanostructures, as calculated from  for 51 STEM ribbons. The average conductivity
measured in this study was 17 ± 2 μS (±s.e.m.) (indicated
by the vertical red line). For reference, the red dotted line indicates  ∼ 38 μS.

The resistances of the graphene
nanoribbons were measured in a
two-probe configuration immediately after STEM sculpting (Figure 2b). The structures
demonstrated linear current–voltage characteristics (Figure 2b) featuring an average
resistance of R = 194 ± 35 kΩ (mean ±
s.e.m.) (Figure 2c).
After high-temperature patterning in TEM, the contact resistances
between the platinum and graphene were found to be low (∼1
kΩ) and therefore not accounted for in the resistance determination.
The graphene conductivity σ can be deduced from the conductance G, using the relation  (see supplemental Figure S1 for the conductance versus conductivity
for our devices). The theoretical planar conductivity of graphene48 is , where e is the electron
charge and ℏ is Planck’s constant. However, experimental
studies on graphene nanoribbons so far revealed conductivities closer
to , with narrower
ribbons typically exposing
(much) lower conductivities,49,50 which likely can be
attributed to damage in the graphene induced during nanopatterning. Figure 2d shows the data
for our graphene nanoribbons (N = 51), with a highest
conductivity of 89 μS (2.3) and a median of 17
± 2 μS (±s.e.m.)
(0.44 ).

Decoupling
of Capacitive Signals Using a Differential Current
Amplifier
We developed a custom-made differential current
amplifier to be able to discriminate between signals in the graphene
current generated by capacitive coupling and signals due to electrostatic
gating or modulations in the density of states. As explained in Figure 3a, capacitive currents IC1,2 are created when temporal
potential fluctuations couple to capacitances between the electrolyte
and the conducting channel of the sensor, where the index 1,2 indicates
the coupling to the left and right electrode of the graphene device,
respectively. Here we distinguish between two relevant capacitance
terms: first, the capacitance between the electrolyte and the graphene
right at the nanopore (Cg) and, second, the capacitances that couple within the several micrometers
range distance from the nanopore. The latter are represented by the
capacitance between the electrolyte and the graphene that extends
from the nanoribbon connecting the electrodes and between the electrolyte
and the electrodes, which we combine in one term Clead (see Figure 3a). Any local change of the potential ΔVl at the nanopore couples to
the sensor’s capacitance Cg to constitute a current . Potential fluctuations that are not strongly
localized at the nanopore, ΔVnl, for instance due to a jump in the applied gate potential,
will couple non-locally to both Cg and Clead: . Capacitive currents
are inherent to all
nanopore sensors that are combined with a second electronic readout,
such as transverse or tunneling currents. Our differential amplifier
applies opposite potentials to the two electrodes connected to the
graphene nanoribbon, see Figure 3ab, (+) to electrode 1 on the left and (−)
to electrode 2 on the right, with respect to the ground potential
of the liquid. All capacitive currents are independent of the electrode
potential, and thus of equal sign at both electrodes, while, by contrast,
any resistance modulation leading to a current signal in the graphene
nanostructure (Ig in Figure 3a) will be of opposite
sign at each voltage electrode (Figure 3c). The differential current amplifier is designed
such that we detect only current contributions that are dissimilar
at the two measurement electrodes, while all induced signals that
are equal in sign will be subtracted (see Figure 3c).

Figure 3 Capacitive coupling and the differential current
amplifier. (a)
Potential fluctuations couple to the graphene signal through the capacitance Cg between the electrolyte and
the graphene nanosensor (gray), which is in parallel with the lead
capacitance Clead between
the electrolyte and the graphene leads contacting the electrodes (dark
blue) and to the electrodes themselves (yellow)). We distinguish local
potential fluctuations ΔVp that are induced by DNA translocations, from non-local potential
fluctuations ΔVnl due to modulations in the gate voltage. On the two electrodes (electrode
1 on the left and electrode 2 on the right), a voltage of opposite
sign but equal magnitude is applied (Vbias). Resistive current modulations in the graphene Ig = gmΔV are indicated in
blue. (b) Equivalent circuit diagram of the setup. Vion is the applied potential during DNA
measurements which simultaneously gates the graphene; Vlift is used as extra “knob”
to tune the gate voltage to a favorable point on the Dirac curve; Vbias sets the bias potential
at the electrodes; Iion represents the ionic current (Axopatch 200B); I1 and I2 are the lead graphene
currents that are used in the differential graphene current measurement;
and Vcom measures the
DC potential of the graphene. (c) Principle of the differential current
measurement. Due to the opposite potentials at the two electrodes,
resistive modulations in the graphene will yield currents I1 and I2 of opposite
polarity. The capacitive currents are, however, independent of the
electrode potentials and thus hold the same polarity. Subtraction
of the two current measurements I1 and I2 leads to the differential measurement, where
the capacitive-current contribution vanishes, whereas the graphene
resistance modulations are maintained. (d) Graphene current versus applied gate potential. The purple trace was obtained
by sweeping Vlift at Vion = 0 mV; the green trace
was acquired by sweeping Vion while Vlift =
0 mV. During the experiments, Vlift and Vion are
both used to gate the graphene, and the effective gate potential can
be expressed as Vgate = Vion – Vlift.

Through this differential measurement, we thus eliminate
all capacitive
contributions to the inplane current while retaining any contributions
due to resistive modulations of the graphene nanoribbon current. To
show the principle of the differential current measurement, we performed
SPICE simulations (Figure S2). DNA events
were simulated by 1 ms-duration voltage steps of 100 mV, and graphene
resistance modulations were simulated by 1 ms-duration resistance
increases. The current at each electrode was measured by a separate
op-amp, each obtaining a unique signal. After the subtraction of the
two current signals measured at the two electrodes, the differential
current signal solely represented the resistance modulation in the
graphene, while the addition of the two responses yielded the capacitive
signal (see Figure S2). In reality, the
amplifier eliminates the capacitive component from the inplane current
signals, while also measuring the common mode DC potentials of the
graphene conducting channel with respect to ground at the two electrodes.
From this common-mode potential measurement in Vcom we can deduce the capacitive currents,
which are related to all potential fluctuations, local and non-local,
where Clead is in parallel
with Cg.

As it
is exposed to the electrolyte solution, the graphene nanoribbon
is gated by the applied voltage Vion on the trans ionic reservoir. Since Vion thus has a dual role, viz., it is necessary for controlling DNA translocations as well as
changes the DC operating point of the graphene nanoribbon, we equipped
the amplifier with additional “knob” to adjust the gate
voltage, Vlift, which
lifts the DC operating potential of the graphene nanostructure with
respect to ground (Figure 3b). As both Vion and Vlift affect the
transconductance of the nanoribbon (Figure 3d), the effective gating potential at the
graphene nanostructure can be defined as Vgate = Vion – Vlift. This is advantageous, since this provides the ability to gate the
sensor through Vlift,
readjusting the operating point to optimize gm each time that the Vion potential changed. As Vlift acts opposite to Vion, the Dirac curves measured as a function
of Vlift or Vion are mirrored about the y-axis (Figure 3d).
The combination of the DC bias voltage Vbias, which sets the in-plane current in the graphene
nanoribbon, and Vion and Vlift can be chosen such that
we perform the DNA measurements at the highest transconductance. Finally,
we note that the Vcom readout can also be used to monitor any leakage of the transverse
current channel to the liquid, which could occur through unintentional
electrochemical processes at the electrodes or on the graphene surface.
In the ideal case, the measured common mode potential of the graphene
should equal the Vlift applied potential. An offset between the two indicates that there
is a leakage. Using this approach, we showed that electrochemical
leakage currents of tens of nanoamperes can arise if electrodes on
the device are only partly coated, while an intact polyimide layer
on the chip resulted in zero leakage currents (Figure S4).

Proof-of-Principle Experiments
We
benchmarked our amplifier
and graphene devices by first performing a series of control measurements.
We simulated DNA translocations by voltage pulses ΔVion (−20 mV, 1 ms) applied to
the ionic voltage channel (Vion = 300 mV) and detected the response in the graphene transverse
current ΔIg. Furthermore,
we probed the current signals in the graphene at three different values
of Vbias (25, 50, and
100 mV) and tuned the DC operating point to either side of the Dirac
curve such that the conductance was dominated by either p- or n-type
carriers (Vlift = 300
mV (n-type) versus +50 mV (p-type) (indicated by
the orange and blue lines that cross the solid lines measured at Vion = 300 mV in Figure 4a), leading to a gm of different sign. As shown in Figure 4a, we measured, as
expected, a near-linear Vbias dependence of the graphene current signals (see Figure S5).

Figure 4 Proof-of-principle. (a) Mapping of the
graphene current response
to a sweep in Vlift gate
potential, at different Vbias (25 mV, green, 50 mV, turquoise, and 100 mV, purple), and
for two values of Vion (0 mV, dotted line, and 300 mV, solid line). The orange and blue
lines indicate the Vlift gate potentials at which we measure the pulses displayed in panel
b (i.e., Vlift= −300 mV and +50 mV, respectively).
(b) Response from the differential current amplifier to −20
mV pulses of 1 ms in Vion. The positive probe (Vion= 300 mV) is located on the graphene side (i.e., trans side) of the membrane. The response in
the graphene current is, as expected, different on both sides of the
Dirac curve: We observe current dips (orange) for Vlift = −300 mV and current peaks
(blue) for Vlift = +50
mV. Measurements were done at three values for the bias voltage, 25,
50, and 100 mV. As expected, larger signals are measured in the graphene
current for higher bias voltages. The common mode channel presents
the capacitive signals, and as expected, these do not change sign
or magnitude, as these do not depend on the gate voltage nor the bias
voltage. A signal amplitude of 1 mV corresponds to a current of 200pA.

The most noteworthy result is
presented in the top panels of Figure 4b, where we measured
a different-sign response of the graphene current to the gate voltage,
depending on the choice of the operating point: downward spikes for Vlift = −300 mV and upward
spikes for Vlift = +50
mV (Figure 4c). The
values of transconductance derived from the Dirac curves (gm = −1.1 nA/mV and 0.7
nA/mV, respectively) were in good agreement with ones obtained from
graphene current responses to the Vion pulses (gm =
−1.1 nA/mV and 1 nA/mV, see Figure S5b). At the same time, the currents induced by capacitive couplings
are measured in the common-mode channel (bottom panels Figure 4b). As expected, these signals
(i) remain of the same sign at any Vlift and (ii) do not increase in magnitude with increasing Vbias. This clearly asserts
that our differential amplifier separates, as designed, the transverse
current response due to gating of the graphene sensor, recorded in
the differential channel, from signals caused by capacitive coupling
which are picked up in the common mode channel of the amplifier.

Probing DNA Translocations
Finally,
we performed DNA
translocation experiments with our graphene nanostructure devices,
where we simultaneously recorded the time traces of the ionic nanopore
current and the graphene transverse current, using the setup shown
in Figure 1a. It proved
to be extremely challenging to perform such experiments successfully,
because of constraints in the extensive fabrication protocol and additionally
because it was very difficult to wet the nanopores. The latter is
likely caused by the hydrophobic nature of the graphene. Note that
the samples cannot be treated with oxygen plasma or piranha solution
as this will remove the graphene. Attempts to wet the pores through
ethanol flushing often resulted in breaking of the nanostructure.
These effects rather unfortunately reduced our yield of successful
experiments dramatically. However, we managed to obtain consistent
data with one sample (out of 180 devices that we started fabricating)
with a good enough signal-to-noise ratio to study the signals in detail.

After addition of 20kb plasmid DNA, we detected current blockades
in the current trace of the ion flow through the graphene nanopore
as well as simultaneous current signals in the electronic current
running through the graphene nanostructure. An example trace of such
events is shown in Figure 5a (and more example events are presented in Figure S6). Clearly, the signals were fully synchronized in
time as for 99.9% of the events in the ionic current (N = 1429) we also observed a very clear signature in the graphene
current. Furthermore, an anticorrelation is observed in the sign of
both signals: a decrease of the ion current, which unambiguously signals
the translocation of DNA at these high-salt conditions, corresponds
to an increase in the current measured through the graphene nanoribbon.
In other words: The passage of the DNA leads to a temporarily lowered
resistance of the graphene nanoribbon.

Figure 5 DNA translocation through
a nanopore in a graphene nanostructure.
(a) Example traces (filtered at 2 kHz) that are simultaneously collected
in three channels: the ionic current (blue), graphene current (red),
and the common mode voltage channel (yellow). The right panel shows
a zoom of one DNA event in the three different channels. (b) Scatterplot
showing the ion current signals versus the graphene
current, for 20 mV (blue) and 30 mV bias voltage (red). The ionic
potential was held constant at 300 mV. All events were detected at Vlift = 0 mV. Larger current
blockades in the ionic current (i.e., more negative values) correspond to larger upward peaks in the
graphene current (more positive). Inset: Medians of graphene current
signals versus bias voltages. (c) Ionic conductance
blockades (blue) and graphene conductance signals (red) versus DNA translocation time. The median of the translocation time distribution
is 2.3 ± 8.9 ms (±s.d.). The ionic conductance blockade
observed is 0.46 ± 0.2 nS (median ± s.d.), and the graphene
conductance signal measured is 0.16 ± 0.08 μS (median ±
s.d.). (d) Graphene current measured versus Vion (at Vlift = 0 mV), recorded prior to the DNA
experiments. From the slope of the fit, we deduce a transconductance
of −0.25 nA/mV.

About 1400 of these events were measured, as presented in
the scatterplots
in Figure 5b,c. The
data in Figure 5b show
that the correlation also holds for the magnitude of the current deviations
in both channels, viz., a larger current dip in the
ionic current corresponds to a larger current increase in the graphene
current. The magnitude of the signal in graphene channel furthermore
scaled with the bias voltage (inset Figure 5b), while the ionic current signals remained
unchanged (Figure S7b). The signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in the graphene current is comparable to the SNR in the
ionic current (see Figure S7c) (SNR = 4.2–4.5
for the graphene current versus 3.8–5.4 for
the ionic current at 20–30 mV bias voltage). Figure 5c displays the ionic conductance
blockades (0.46 ± 0.19 nS (median ± s.d.)) and the graphene
conductance signals (0.16 ± 0.08 μS (median ± s.d.)) versus the observed translocations times. The distribution
of the observed translocation time (top of Figure 5c) has a median of 2.3 ± 8.9 ms (±s.d.).
The widespread of translocation times shows that a substantial amount
of events is much longer, which may be due to interactions between
the DNA molecule and the graphene. Interestingly, the subset of events
with longer translocations times (all >2.5 ms) showed a 16% larger
graphene current signal. The transconductance recorded prior to the
measurements was −0.25 nA/mV (see Figure 5d), at the potentials at which we performed
the measurements. For the large majority of the events, no signal
was detected in the common mode channel (see Figure 5a for a typical example). For a small minority
of the events (3.5%), we measured a correlated signature in common
mode channel of ∼100 μV magnitude, corresponding to transient
currents of approximately 10pA. Eventually, after about 30 min of
measurement time, the nanostructure broke, and the current was lost
in the graphene nanostructure. Although the nanopore current had significantly
increased to 16 nA, indicating a much increased pore size, events
could still be detected in the ionic current, but the signatures in
the graphene current were lost.

Data Interpretation
To interpret these signals, we
first consider that we measured on the left wing of the Dirac curve
with Vlift = 0 mV and Vion = 300 mV, that is, with
p-type conduction in graphene. Electrostatic interactions in this
case would yield, as observed, a current enhancement in the graphene
when the DNA molecule translocates through the nanostructure. Electrostatic
gating by the negative charge of the DNA backbone and gating due to
a change in the local potential at the nanopore during DNA translocation
will both induce a current enhancement through Ig = gmΔV. From the measured transconductance gm = −0.25 nA/mV (see Figure 5d) and the median
of the graphene current signals Ig = 3.8 nA measured at 20 mV Vbias (see inset Figure 5b), we deduce a ΔV ≅
−15 mV.

What underlies this induced voltage change? We
first discuss the potential change that the charge of the DNA backbone
can generate through . We consider
that the Debye screening length
at 1 M KCl is approximately 0.3 nm and that at any distance further
than that no charge is probed. The maximum charge of the DNA as seen
from the nanopore rim in 1 M KCl is approximated to be 2e or a fraction of that (as the DNA basepairs each carry an effective
charge of 0.5e51 and as
the effective graphene length is approximately 0.6 nm,10 see SI-9 for details).
To approximate a value for the relevant capacitance of the graphene,
we consider a ring of 1 nm extending from the nanopore rim, to find Cg ≅ 5 × 10–19 F (see SI-8), yielding
an estimate of ΔVQ ranging between −30 mV and −600 mV. It must be noted,
however, that the capacitance value extracted from the measured transconductance
is substantially smaller, which would correspond to much higher ΔVQ values. Second, we examine
the potential change at the nanopore that occurs due to the insertion
of DNA in the nanopore. With the use of an analytical relation,38,40,42 we approximate the potential
change at the nanopore to be about −50 mV, based on our nanopore
geometry and DNA plasmid analyte (see SI-9 and Figure S9), which can be an overestimation because surface
charges are not accounted for in this relation.38

From these estimates, we conclude that the measured
response signals
in the graphene current can be explained as due to the local potential
change and DNA charge. The approximations discussed above show that
both effects can induce a ΔV in the order of
tens of mV, which is close to what we measure here (−15 mV).
Furthermore, it is possible that the graphene current signals are
partly due to a non-electrostatic coupling between the nanopore and
the DNA bases,23−34 leading to a modulation in the density of states which causes a
change in the graphene nanoribbon conductance. Unfortunately, different
theories provide rather conflicting predictions regarding the signal
sign and magnitude, which hinders comparison to our data.

Finally,
we comment on those rare (3.5%) events where we measured
∼100 μV signals in the common mode channel, which correspond
to ∼20pA transient capacitive currents. The local capacitance
between the electrolyte and the graphene at the nanopore is simply
too small to induce such currents through  (see SI-9).
From this relation, it can be conceived that pA currents rather correspond
to capacitances in the order of pF. The capacitance of the area exposed
to liquid was measured to be ∼20 pF (see SI-9). Therefore, we attribute these events to non-local interactions
ΔVnl to the capacitances
of the leads Clead (i.e., to the graphene capacitance at a
distance from the nanopore). This is supported by Spice simulations
that show a 100 μV response in the common mode channel to 10
mV voltage steps when the capacitance at the nanopore is increased
to 20 pF, see SI-9 for details.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have shown that it is possible to fabricate freestanding
30 × 30 nm graphene nanoribbons with a 5 nm nanopore in its center,
which allow to measure resistive modulations in the inplane graphene
current due to DNA translocation through the nanopore. Due to our
high-temperature STEM sculpting approach, in combination with transfer
techniques to assembled stacked structures of 2D materials, we were
able to make graphene nanostructures that are significantly smaller
than what was studied before. With our custom-made differential current
amplifier, we presented a method that enables to discriminate between
resistive modulations in the graphene current and signals due to capacitive
coupling. Despite this success, we also have to note that, unfortunately,
the fabrication procedure and protocol for DNA measurements were overly
challenging, yielding an unacceptably low yield (as we successfully
obtained dual signals in only 1 out of 180 devices; see Methods for details). In future studies, a more scalable approach
could be explored, such as e-beam lithography with ion beam milling52 instead of TEM sculpting, leading to a higher
device yield. Furthermore, other 2D materials, such as MoS2 and WS218,19 that can be oxygen-plasma treated
to render the pore hydrophilic, could provide interesting alternatives
to graphene, using the same approach of inplane current detection
toward high-bandwidth DNA sequencing.

Methods
Fabrication
Procedure
Devices were built on top of
a silicon wafer, diced into silicon chips with 500 nm-thick silicon
nitride membranes with embedded platinum heater coils, which were
used to locally heat the graphene during STEM sculpting. Windows were
etched in the backside of the “heaterchips” using backside
spraycoating of e-beam resist, through membrane e-beam lithography,
followed by RIE etching to obtain windows to 100 nm thickness.45 Platinum electrodes were deposited on the topside
of the chips using e-beam lithography (200 nm CSAR 6200.09 resist)
and metal evaporation (10 nm Ti, 60 nm Pt). Next, 400 nm holes were
patterned using e-beam lithography (800 nm resist layer CSAR 6200.18)
and RIE etching (50W, 25:25 sccm Ar:CHF3, 80 μbar).
Monolayer graphene flakes were exfoliated onto silicon wafers with
90 nm SiO2 and transferred onto the chips with platinum
electrodes and holes in the membranes using the wedging transfer.53 To prevent leakage currents on the membrane,
and because sculpting with a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
is difficult and time-consuming on supported graphene, graphene structures
consisting of a 200 × 200 nm square with leads were prepatterned
using e-beam lithography (200 nm PMMA A4) and oxygen plasma etching
(40 s, 20 W, 20 sccm, 800 μbar), and the PMMA was removed through
soaking in room-temperature acetone overnight. To prevent polymer
residues after lithography, fresh stocks of PMMA were used. Subsequently,
a 30 × 30 nm graphene nanostructure was sculpted using high-temperature
STEM, as detailed below. After this high-temperature patterning in
the TEM, the contact resistances were low (∼1 kΩ). To
support the freestanding sculpted nanoribbon and to cover the cavities
next to the ribbon (in order to make the nanopore the only possible
way for the DNA to pass), we transferred thin (3–7 layer) flakes
of h-BN on top of the nanoribbon using wedging transfer. Relatively
free of dangling bonds, h-BN is a good insulator, has an atomically
smooth surface, and has a lattice that is very similar to that of
graphene, which makes it a good material to make stacked structures
with graphene.54 h-BN flakes were exfoliated
onto silicon wafers with 90 nm SiO2, and the flake thickness
was determined using optical microscopy. In order to do this transfer,
a glass mask was placed on top of the target device with the graphene
nanostructure during the oxygen plasma cleaning step. The deposition
of a very thick polyimide layer (1.5 μm) on top of the electrodes
proved to be the only strategy to overcome electrochemical leakage
during our nanopore measurements. Before patterning, samples were
prebaked at 100 °C, and an adhesion layer vm651/vm652 0.1% in
H2O was spin-coated (3000 rpm) on top and baked for 2 min
at 120 °C. Next, the layer of polyimide was spun on top (PI-2545)
at 5000 rpm to obtain a thickness of 1.5 μm. The polymer was
soft baked at 90 °C on a hot plate for 10 min. Finally, a 200
nm layer of PMMA (A4 4000 rpm) was spin-coated on top and baked at
90 °C on the hot plate for 5 min. A small area of 5 × 5
μm2 at the nanostructure was exposed to the e-beam.
After the development of the PMMA toplayer in MIBK (25% in IPA) and
solvation of the exposed PI in diluted tetramethylammonium hydroxide
(Mf321, 25% and 10%), a circular area with diameter ∼10 μm
was cleared, and the PMMA was subsequently removed in room temperature
acetone overnight. Finally, the nanopore was drilled in STEM mode,
while using Joule heating to overcome carbon contamination. Before
nanopore measurements were performed, the samples were baked at 180
°C for 5 min on a hot plate, to cure the polyimide.

STEM Sculpting
of Nanoribbons and Nanopores
Sculpting
of graphene nanoribbons and nanopores was performed using the focused
electron beam of a TEM, model FEI Titan 80-300, operated in scanning
mode (STEM). The fine probe of the electron beam (0.1 nm spot size,
0.15 nA beam current, 5 ms dwell time, doses ranging between 107–108 e/atom), combined with the 300 keV
electron energy, allowed us to knock off single carbon atoms from
the graphene lattice, so that we could “sculpt” graphene
according to our needs.46 Immediate feedback
on the sculpting process was easily obtained by switching the microscope
to imaging mode (5 μs dwell time and doses ranging between 104–105 e/atom). During sculpting, the electron
beam decomposed the hydrocarbons which were adsorbed on graphene surface
(originating from the TEM vacuum chamber and organic residues from
solvents used during sample preparation), causing carbon atoms to
“stick” near the illuminated area and grow into a thin
amorphous carbon layer. Such carbon deposition was minimized by (1)
the high temperatures (>300 °C), at which the surface diffusion
of carbon adatoms is enhanced preventing adatom accumulation in the
spot where the e-beam illuminates the sample, while graphene lattice
recrystallization or “self-repair” is induced at high
temperatures (∼500 °C),46,47,55 and (2) the high vacuum (∼10–8 mbar), as a lower total pressure implies a lower rate of impinging
carbon atoms on the surface. For Joule heating, the Pt electrodes
on the membrane were used to pass a high current densities (∼108 A/cm2) through the graphene ribbon, to locally
reach a very high temperature.55 After
polyimide deposition, the devices could not be heated above 300 °C,
as the polymer would turn conductive at such temperatures. We therefore
aimed for high vacuum to prevent carbon contamination and kept the
samples in the TEM vacuum chamber for 12–24 h, until the vacuum
reached ∼5 × 10–8 mbar.

Device Yield
The elegancy of our approach is that it
allows exquisite control of the graphene nanostructure properties,
but its downside is that the device fabrication is extremely challenging,
leading to a low device yield. In total, we started the fabrication
procedure on about 180 devices, of which 51 graphene nanostructures
were sculpted with STEM, 15 of which survived the h-BN transfer, polyimide
passivation, and nanopore drilling. It showed to be very difficult
to establish a decent nanopore current, likely due to the hydrophobic
nature of the graphene. Attempts to wet the nanopores by ethanol flushing
frequently resulted in breaking of the nanostructures. We managed
to perform DNA translocation measurements on a few devices, but with
only two devices we measured clear DNA signals in the ionic current
channel, of which in one device, we managed to measure clear resistive
modulations in the graphene current due to DNA, occurring simultaneously
with the ionic current events. Comparison of the transconductances,
noise levels, and ionic signals of the two samples are given in Table S1. In the sample where we did not resolve
graphene signals, the sensitivity was lower, and the noise levels
were higher.

Nanopore Experiments
The samples
were mounted in a
PEEK flowcell that fits a dedicated holder to insert Ag/AgCl probes
in the flow chambers and to connect the electrodes to the electrode
pads. The Vion gate potential
is set with the use of an Axopatch 200B patchclamp amplifier, connected
to two Ag/AgCl electrodes on each side of the membrane. The positive
electrode was located on the graphene side (trans) of the membrane.
The platinum electrode pads on the chip were contacted by PoGo pins
connected to the differential preamplifier, such that the amplifier
is in close proximity to the graphene nanostructure (minimizing input
capacitances). Nanopore measurements were performed with 1 M KCl,
10 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 8.1), and 3 ng/μL 20kb DNA
plasmids dissolved in the same buffer. We measured the transconductance
by sweeping Vion in the
range of the voltages that were used during the DNA measurements (in
our case 200–400 mV) at selected Vlift gate potentials. Typically, the measured sensitivities
ranged between 0.1 and 2 nA/mV (varying per device). Due to the presence
of the graphene nanostructure, we were not able to oxygen plasma or
piranha clean the samples, making it difficult to wet the nanopore
during DNA measurements. Attempts to wet the nanopores by flushing
ethanol and buffer often resulted in breaking of the nanoribbons.
The events were extracted from the ionic current traces using Tranzalyser,56 and the corresponding time traces in the differential
and common mode channels were analyzed with Matlab.
