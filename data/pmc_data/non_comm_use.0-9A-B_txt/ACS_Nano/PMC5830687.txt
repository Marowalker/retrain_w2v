A low-temperature
chemical vapor growth of Ge nanowires using Ga
as seed material is demonstrated. The structural and chemical analysis
reveals the homogeneous incorporation of ∼3.5 at. % Ga in the
Ge nanowires. The Ga-containing Ge nanowires behave like metallic
conductors with a resistivity of about ∼300 μΩcm
due to Ga hyperdoping with electronic contributions of one-third of
the incorporated Ga atoms. This is the highest conduction value observed
by in situ doping of group IV nanowires reported
to date. This work demonstrates that Ga is both an efficient seed
material at low temperatures for Ge nanowire growth and an effective
dopant changing the semiconductor into a metal-like conductor.

==== Body
Anisotropic
Ge nanostructures
have been used as active components for different applications including
field effect transistors,1 lithium ion
batteries,2 solar cells,3 and humidity sensors.4 Ge nanowires
(NWs) have been successfully prepared by different methods in bottom-up
and top-down approaches.5 The most popular
synthesis approach is the use of metal growth promoters in bottom-up
processes including vapor–liquid–solid (VLS),6 supercritical-fluid–liquid–solid
(SCFLS),7 and solution–liquid–solid
(SLS)8 mechanisms as well as the growth
by solid metal seeds.9 Many metallic growth
seeds have been described in the literature to result in highly crystalline
Ge NWs.9−11 For some of the above-mentioned applications doping
of the NWs is a prerequisite, which can be achieved either by external
sources during crystal growth12−14 or by the incorporation of atoms
from metal seeds15−18 used for the realization of anisotropic crystal constitution. The
incorporation of dopants in the Ge matrix has recently been the focus
of several studies, and rather effective doping with heavy group III
atoms has been observed in low-temperature growth of Ge NWs using
In as seeding material19 and also for Bi
in Ge nanoparticles.20 The electrical properties
of the In-containing Ge NWs have not been investigated, which might
be related to pronounced twinning of the NWs derived by that approach.
Therefore, the actual activity and effect of the nature of the incorporated
In atoms on the electronic properties are unknown. In contrast, Bi-containing
Ge nanoparticles exhibit an increased charge carrier density when
compared to undoped Ge crystals prepared by the same method.20

Even though Ga is known to be an excellent
p-dopant for Ge, to
the best of our knowledge, Ga has not been used for vapor-based growth
strategies of Ge nanostructures in the past. The electrodeposition
using Ga as nucleation sites for the growth of Ge microwires, the
so-called electrochemical liquid–liquid growth mode, is the
only exception where Ga was identified as an effective growth promoter.21,22 This type of growth using Ga as an electrode and seed leads to protuberances
along the microwires. The Ga-seeded microwires typically showed highly
pronounced tapering and incorporation of 8–10 at. % Ga in the
Ge matrix. This is accompanied by p-type behavior in the electronic
properties.21 However, the dopant activation
was poor and the carrier concentration was several orders of magnitude
lower than the actual Ga concentration.22

First indications for suitable conditions of Ga-mediated Ge
NW
growth can be deduced from the binary Ge–Ga phase diagram.
The Ga/Ge eutectic is very close to the melting point of Ga (29.8
°C) with only 0.006 at. % Ge (<1 at. % at 200 °C) in
the Ga melt (Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information; SI).23 According to the classification
of metal particles acting as catalysts for NW formation, Ga can be
considered to be a “type B” catalyst with a eutectic
containing less than 1 at. % of the semiconductor material and the
absence of germanide phases in the binary phase diagram.24

Our study illustrates that Ga can be an
efficient metal growth
seed for single-crystalline Ge NWs at temperatures slightly above
200 °C in vapor phase syntheses. During the synthesis ∼3.51
± 0.29 at. % Ga is incorporated in the growing Ge matrix, leading
to the formation of a material with dramatically altered electronic
properties. Such hyperdoped Ge NWs with ∼5 × 1020 cm–3 active p-dopant atoms will exhibit quasi-metallic
conductivity.

Results and Discussion
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) imaging reveals a high density
of Ge NWs achieved using a Ga-mediated low-temperature chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) synthesis approach as shown in Figure 1a. A very slight tapering is discernible
in these NWs, and the diameters average about 100 nm, while typical
lengths are several micrometers. A scanning transmission electron
microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) map for
Ga and Ge near the NW tip is shown in the inset of Figure 1a, nicely visualizing the Ga
particle at the tip of the Ge NWs. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was used to study microstructural properties of the Ge NWs.
For that purpose Ge NWs were deposited onto lacey carbon grids by
direct transfer using shear force. The single-crystalline nature of
the Ga-seeded Ge NWs is revealed by high-resolution TEM as illustrated
in Figure 1b. The fast
Fourier transformation (FFT) pattern shown in the inset depicts the
growth direction of the Ge NWs to be along the ⟨111⟩
axis, which is the typical orientation for group IV NWs of this diameter.25 Slight tapering can also be noticed in the TEM
image of the inset along a NW of several micrometers and is discussed vide infra.

for
6 h. The inset shows a STEM EDX mapping indicating the Ga particle
at the tip of the NWs. (b) High-resolution TEM image of a selected
Ga-seeded Ge NW revealing the single-crystalline nature of the material.
The growth along the ⟨111⟩-axis can be determined by
the fast Fourier transformation in the inset.

The local composition of the NWs has been determined by STEM-EDX.
The Ga particle terminating the NW contains ≤1 at. % Ge according
to EDX data, which is slightly higher than the expected value at room
temperature. According to the phase diagram, Ge is essentially immiscible
in Ga at room temperature (0.006 at. %), but the liquid phase at the
growth temperature of 210 °C contains up to 1 at. % Ge.23 Conversely, according to the phase diagram at
the growth temperatures applied here a maximum of ∼0.07 at.
% Ga should be expected in the Ge NWs.23 However, STEM-EDX mapping of a NW section reveals a much higher
homogeneously distributed concentration of Ga in the Ge matrix (Figure 2a). The average Ga
content determined by EDX in these NWs is 3.51 ± 0.29 at. % (1σ
standard deviation). For an overview of NWs in the diameter range
65–150 nm see Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information. The accuracy of all EDX values should be considered to
potentially deviate by ±0.5 at. % due to the limited sensitivity
of the method. Complementary bulk quantification of hyperdoped Ge
NW samples using laser-assisted inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(LA-ICP-MS) reveals high concentrations of Ga in the Ge NWs. The most
accurate comparison of the data obtained by EDX and LA-ICP-MS is based
on Ge nanorod samples after removal of all access Ga on the surface,
suggesting an overestimation of ∼0.5 at. % by EDX analysis.
These investigations will be published in detail elsewhere. An EDX
line scan across a typical NW shows the replication of the Ge signal
in the Ga channel, and no hints toward a potential core–shell
formation have been observed (Figure 2b). This is a representative result for different positions
along a NW. The diminishing NW diameter along its axis can be attributed
to the incorporation of the Ga growth promoter in the Ge NW body and
not caused by an additional vapor–solid growth of Ge on the
NW sidewalls.15

distribution of Ga in the Ge matrix and (b) the Ga signal across a
NW replicating the shape of the Ge signal very well. (c) Ga concentration
profiles along the NW axis for a distance of 2 μm (blue) and
a radial concentration profile (green). The shaded red area was included
to represent an uncertainty interval of ±0.5 at. % immanent to
EDX.

EDX line scans along the Ge NW
growth axis reveal a quite homogeneous
distribution of Ga with only a minor fluctuation around 3.91 ±
0.27 at. % (1σ) as illustrated in Figure 2c. A radial scan as illustrated in the inset
of Figure 2c shows
a similar distribution (3.86 ± 0.24 at. %; 1σ). In general,
EDX profiles display fluctuations around a mean value in the 3–4
at. % range and thus indicate a random incorporation of Ga in the
Ge NW matrix, as can be expected from a self-doping process involving
the catalyst particle. In contrast, doping profiles will differ along
the NW axis when impurities are preferentially incorporated via vapor–solid growth on the sidewalls, leading
to tapering of the NWs.12

The remarkably
high Ga concentration might be a consequence of
solute trapping at step edges during the Ge NW growth. This model
has been discussed for the incorporation of Al in Si NWs, where unusually
high Al concentrations in the Si NW body have been observed.17,26 According to the literature, the group IV NW growth can proceed
with successive addition of bilayers through a step flow process,27 and during this process catalyst atoms can be
trapped in the bilayer due to the high growth rate. However, the NW
growth presented here is quite slow when considering the growth time
of hours. Nevertheless, a step flow process to form the bilayer could
be assumed as being fast even though the overall growth rate is slow.
The actual bilayer growth via step flow requires
an initial nucleation event with a distinct energy barrier that has
to be overcome. A reason for the small overall growth rate can be
the slow decomposition of the Ge precursor and thus an extended time
span for the buildup of sufficient supersaturation in the Ga growth
seed to overcome the nucleation barrier. Once the new layer is growing,
the supersaturation drops dramatically and enrichment of the growing
materials has to take place before a new layer forms. The actual efficiency
of incorporation during this crystal growth process is most likely
due to the similar atomic radii of Ga and Ge and therefore an absence
of strain by the incorporation of Ga in the Ge lattice.28 Therefore, we propose the same model of solute
trapping as applied to Al incorporation in Si NWs.17 Within this scenario the observed high Ga content in the
Ge matrix becomes plausible. A direct experimental proof of the trapping
of the Ga growth promoter in the Ge matrix during the Ge NW growth
could most probably be achieved using a combined strategy of presented
methods for Al-seeded Si NWs, but would ideally require in
situ TEM imaging facilities.27,29 However, the
high Ga concentration trapped in the Ge matrix represents a metastable
material composition. At temperatures close to the growth temperature
no changes in the composition could be recorded for heating cycles
of 10 h at 250 °C due to limited and very slow diffusion processes
at these temperatures. Typical for metastable compositions, increased
annealing temperatures lead to diffusion processes and thus Ga segregation.
This effect can be illustrated best monitoring twin structures, which
are a minor fraction in the nanowire samples. Figure S3 shows a twin along the axis of a Ge0.97Ga0.03 NW grown at 230 °C without a sign of Ga enrichment
at the interface even after 10 h at 250 °C, while a similar twin
heated for 6 h at 400 °C shows not only strain effects in the
TEM but also Ga enrichment/segregation at the interface of both crystals
in the STEM-EDX. The twin structures are ideal to illustrate this
effect because the mobility of the segregated Ga at interfaces is
limited when compared to a surface diffusion. Similar phase separation
of a component in a metastable Ge-based alloy can be found in the
well-known GeSn system when the crystalline phase is heated above
a threshold temperature, which depends on the initial composition.30

The electronic properties of the hereafter
called Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs have been determined
after treatment in 2%
hydrofluoric acid to remove any Ga from the NWs surface. The NWs have
been deposited on Si substrates with a 100 nm thick, thermally grown
SiO2 layer by dry transfer and contacted by aluminum pads
fabricated by electron-beam lithography, sputter deposition, and lift-off
techniques. Two-terminal I–V measurements of Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs with different
diameters as well as an intrinsic Ge NW grown by Au-mediated CVD are
shown in Figure 2a.

The Ge0.97Ga0.03 NW devices integrated in
two-point measurement modules show ohmic behavior as expected for
a highly doped semiconductor in conjunction with very high current
levels. The thereof calculated resistance of the hyperdoped Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs is about 3 orders of magnitude lower
than for the intrinsic Ge NW and thus amply illustrates the strong
impact of the incorporation of the Ga seed material in the Ge crystal
(lower inset of Figure 3a). Due to the high conductivity values of the Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs, we neither expected nor could measure any noticeable
field effect response in the back-gated NW field effect transistor.
Also, in low-temperature resistance measurements in transverse magnetic
fields we found a negligibly small magnetoresistance effect. Spread
in the two-probe I–V characteristics
of different NWs (see Figure S4 of the
Supporting Information) could be traced back to variations in the
individual contact resistances by complementary four-probe measurements.
From four-point measurements exemplarily shown in Figure 3b, we determined resistivity
values quite typically to be as large as 300 μΩcm for
Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs, while intrinsic Ge NWs grown
by using Au as growth promoter reveal resistivity values of about
11 Ωcm30 as described in the literature.

Figure 3 (a) Two-probe I–V measurements
of Ge0.97Ga0.03 NW devices of different diameters
as well as a Au-seeded Ge NW for comparison. (b) The influence of
contact resistances can be illustrated in four-point geometry and
compared with a two-terminal measurement using the same NW.

From the resistivity values measured
in this study we deduce an
electronically active impurity concentration of ∼5 × 1020 cm–3 for p-dopants, such as Ga, in bulk
Ge samples using literature data.31 This
is far above the solubility limit of Ga in Ge at thermodynamic equilibrium,
which would lead to a maximum Ga concentration of 3.1 × 1019 cm–3 (∼0.07 at. %) according to
the phase diagram.23 Therefore, the value
determined here suggests that approximately one-third of the ∼3.5
at. % Ga atoms (1.5 × 1021 cm–3)
are electronically active and are expected to be at substitutional
sites in the Ge lattice. In addition, Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs can withstand remarkably high currents of more than 1 mA, corresponding
to about 12 MA/cm,2 before device failure
occurs (Figure S4 inset).

In contrast,
electrodeposition of Ge micro/nanowires using Ga as
electrode material also leads to the incorporation of Ga in the Ge
matrix but results in strongly tapered nano/microwires as well as
p-type semiconductor behavior.21,22 Even though these anisotropic
Ge structures contain twice or three times as much Ga (8–10
at. %) when compared to the material described herein, the effect
on the electronic properties is very low. The actual number of electronically
active Ga atoms is determined to be about 2.3 × 1015 cm–3, correlating to ∼10–7 at. % of electronically active Ga dopants. The differences could
be related to temperature effects during growth (40 °C for electrodeposition vs 210 °C in this study), the actual growth rate, crystal
quality, and Ga being incorporated at actual substitutional sites.
The extraordinarily large effect on the electronic properties can
be also manifested comparing the impact of ∼5 at. % Al incorporation
in Si NWs, where only a density of ∼1 × 1019 cm–3 electronically active impurities has been
observed. These values are more than ∼50 times lower than we
have observed in the hyperdoped Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs.

Temperature-dependent resistance measurements have been
recorded
for Ge0.97Ga0.03 NW devices in four-terminal
configurations and compared to Au-seeded Ge NWs. The Au-seeded and
thus nominally intrinsic Ge NW shows an increase in resistivity of
6 orders of magnitude under cooling from 300 to 4 K, while the Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs exhibit a weakly metallic-like temperature-dependent
resistivity decrease with a residual resistance ratio of about 1.2
(Figure 4). A similar
behavior is reported for other dopants, such as group VI elements
in Si, showing the same temperature dependence when unusually high
concentrations of dopants are incorporated in the semiconductor crystal.32 In these studies the notion “hyperdoping”
was coined and represents concentrations of the dopants exceeding
their thermodynamic solubility limit.33,34 These high-impurity
concentrations can form a new impurity band that leads to a transition
of the semiconductor to a metallic-like conductor (semiconductor–metal
transition) instead of an impurity state within the band gap of the
semiconductor for small and intermediate doping levels. Hence, following
this reasoning the Ge0.97Ga0.03 NWs are hyperdoped
with Ga due to their described electronic behavior and the high Ga
level representing ∼50 times the solubility limit at the growth
temperature and exceeding even 3–4 times the maximum solubility
observed at high temperatures.23

Figure 4 Evolution of
resistance during cooling in the temperature range
300–0.269 K. The upper inset shows a comparison of the resistivity
of a Au-seeded intrinsic Ge NW and a Ge0.97Ga0.03 NW measured in four-point configuration in the temperature range
4–300 K. The lower right inset shows a drop in resistance at
∼1.6 K that has been obtained in two-point geometry and is
displayed with a constant offset of 1020 Ω due to the influence
of contact resistance.

Upon further cooling, a small drop in resistance of ∼30
Ω at 1.6 K is observed (Figure 4 inset and Figure S5), which
is suppressed at the lowest temperature of 0.269 K by applying a weak
overcritical magnetic field of less than 250 mT (Figure S6). This resistance drop is associated with the Al
electrodes used in the two-probe measurement that have been fabricated
by sputtering and are expected to contain a small amount of oxygen
impurities, causing the critical temperature increase of Al (1.1 K
in the clean limit) to 1.6 K.35 The Ge0.97Ga0.03 NW measured down to 0.269 K did not show
a superconducting transition, but a possible onset of superconductivity
below this temperature cannot be ruled out by this study

Conclusion
We demonstrate the successful Ga-assisted growth of Ge NWs at low
temperatures of 210 °C. This process leads to hyperdoping of
the Ge NWs with Ga concentrations of ∼3.5 ± 0.29 at. %,
which is ∼50 times higher than the solubility limit at this
temperature. The high Ga incorporation efficiency is probably due
to solute trapping during the growth of Ge bilayers. Hyperdoping of
Ga in Ge leads to metal-like behavior conductivity of the NWs, and
the importance of contact resistances in devices prepared using Al
as contact material was identified.

Methods
All synthetic procedures and handling of the chemicals for the
nanostructure synthesis have been carried out using Schlenk techniques
or an argon-filled glovebox (MBraun). Solvents were dried over sodium
and stored in a glovebox. The (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)gallium(I)
precursor (Ga(C5Me5); GaCp*) was prepared using
sonochemical synthesis of GaI and subsequent salt elimination using
KCp* in dry benzene according to the literature.36tert-Butylgermane (TBG; (C4H9)GeH3) was purchased from Gelest.

Nanostructure
Synthesis
tert-Butylgermane
[76 mg (572 μmol)–152 mg (1144 μmol)] was loaded
in a 5 mL cell from HIP using a glovebox. The silicone substrates
were infiltrated by GaCp* and introduced in the cell before the vessel
was closed. Heating this vessel for 6–12 h at temperatures
of 210–230 °C results in the growth of dense nanowire
meshes on the silicone substrate. Data presented herein are limited
to the NWs grown at 210 °C.

Post growth annealing was performed
in a quartz tube at 250–400 °C for 6–10 h under
a 10% H2/90% N2 atmosphere to test the stability
of the material.

Nanostructure Characterization
The
Ge NWs were analyzed
using a FEI Inspect F50 scanning electron microscope. The Ge NWs were
deposited on lacey carbon copper grids by dry transfer using shear
force for TEM characterization (Plano). In this study, a FEI TECNAI
F20 operated at 200 kV and equipped with high angle annular dark field
(HAADF) STEM and EDX detectors was used. The limited accuracy of the
EDX analysis can lead to a potential deviation by ±0.5 at. %
of the values stated here. The elemental maps were recorded and quantified
using the AMETEK TEAM package. The images were recorded and treated
using Digital Micrograph software. LA-ICP-MS measurements were performed
using a commercially available laser ablation system (New Wave 213,
ESI, Fremont, CA, USA) with a frequency-quintupled 213 nm Nd:YAG laser
in combination with a quadrupole ICP-MS instrumentation (Thermo iCAP
Qc, ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For quantification, 69Ga was compared with the 76Ge signal while standards
of metal ratios between 1:99 and 5:95 Ga/Ge were prepared using the
metal halogenides dissolved in aqueous potassium hydroxide.

Electrical
Characterization
The vapor-grown Ge NWs
were deposited by dry transfer onto a highly p-doped Si substrate
with a 100 nm thick, thermally grown SiO2 layer and predefined
macroscopic Ti–Au bonding pads. Individual NWs were contacted
with 150 nm thick Al pads by electron beam lithography, Al sputter
deposition preceded by a HI dip (5 s using 14 % HI to remove any germanium
oxide), and lift-off techniques.

The electrical measurements
at room-temperature and ambient conditions were performed using a
combination of a semiconductor analyzer (HP 4156B) and a probe station.
To minimize the influence of ambient light as well as electromagnetic
fields, the probe station was placed in a dark box.

Low-temperature
measurements (4–300 K) were performed in
vacuum at a pressure of approximately 2.5 × 10–5 mbar using a 4He cryostat (Cryo Industries CRC-102) and
a semiconductor analyzer (Keysight B1500A). Temperature-dependent
resistance measurements in the range 0.269–4 K were performed
in a 3He cryostat employing a sourcemeter (Keithley, 2600)
in two-probe configuration at a fixed current of 1 μA. Magnetic
field dependent measurements were done using a NbTi superconducting
solenoid.
