The
catalytic performance and optical properties of bimetallic
nanoparticles critically depend on the atomic distribution of the
two metals in the nanoparticles. However, at elevated temperatures,
during light-induced heating, or during catalysis, atomic redistribution
can occur. Measuring such metal redistribution in situ is challenging, and a single experimental technique does not suffice.
Furthermore, the availability of a well-defined nanoparticle system
has been an obstacle for a systematic investigation of the key factors
governing the atomic redistribution. In this study, we follow metal
redistribution in precisely tunable, single-crystalline Au-core, Ag-shell
nanorods in situ, both at a single particle and an
ensemble-averaged level, by combining in situ transmission
electron spectroscopy with in situ extended X-ray
absorption fine structure validated by ex situ measurements.
We show that the kinetics of atomic redistribution in Au–Ag
nanoparticles depend on the metal composition and particle volume,
such that a higher Ag content or a larger particle size led to significantly
slower metal redistribution. We developed a simple theoretical model
based on Fick’s first law that can correctly predict the composition-
and size-dependent alloying behavior in Au–Ag nanoparticles,
as observed experimentally.

==== Body
By the combination
of two metals
in bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs), new and enhanced optical and catalytic
properties can arise that can lead to applications in, e.g., sensing, biomedicine, data storage, and catalysis.1−10 The physicochemical properties of these bimetallic particles can
be tuned not only by varying the metal composition but also by changing
the atomic distribution of the two metals within the nanoparticles
at a fixed composition (for example from core–shell to alloyed
NPs).8,10−15 The exact atomic distribution of the metals is particularly important
in catalysis, in which the atoms close to the surface play a dominant
role in the catalytic performance.7,16−19 Furthermore, when exposing bimetallic nanoparticles to various gas
atmospheres and heating them to elevated temperatures, atomic redistribution
can occur.11,17,18,20−26 This alters the optical8,13,26 and catalytic properties16−18,24,27 and can even lead to severe deactivation
of the catalyst. Therefore, understanding atomic restructuring is
crucial in the design of new catalytic and optical bimetallic materials.

Various techniques have been employed to follow metal redistribution in situ, each providing information on a different length
scale.20 Single-particle studies often
make use of in situ transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). With this technique, sub-nanometer or even atomic resolutions
can be obtained while heating the sample.17,21,22 This technique, however, is limited to samples
that are very stable under electron irradiation to avoid electron-beam-induced
artifacts.28−30 Therefore, to verify the influence of the electron
beam, it is important to also perform ex situ heating
measurements.30 Alternatively, X-ray-based
techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray
absorption fine structure (XAFS), also offer atomic information but
averaged over a much larger number of particles.18,25,31 XPS allows us to specifically study the
surface composition of the NPs, and it is thus particularly suitable
to measure surface segregation effects.17,23,24 However, XAFS measurements give insight in the degree
of mixing and oxidation state of the atoms within the nanoparticles
and can be carried out in different gas atmospheres.18,25,31 Thus, to follow the metal redistribution
in bimetallic nanoparticles at multiple length scales (on an atomic,
single-particle, and ensemble-averaged level), one technique does
not suffice, and a multi-technique approach is required.

In
addition, a systematic, quantitative, and reproducible study
of atomic restructuring requires a well-defined model system. The
use of rather heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts, obtained via standard
catalyst preparation methods, is especially problematic when using
techniques such as XAFS and XPS, in which the measured signal is an
ensemble average. Therefore, the influence of fundamental parameters
such as the metal composition and particle volume on the atomic redistribution
process in bimetallic nanoparticles are largely unexplored.

In this study, we investigated the thermally driven atomic redistribution
in single crystalline Au–Ag core–shell nanorods in situ both on a single particle and an ensemble-averaged
level. We employed colloidally synthesized Au-core, Ag-shell nanorods
of which the composition, size, and shape was tuned precisely.9 By the coating of the metal nanorods with a protective
mesoporous silica coating,32 preservation
of the particle shape during atomic redistribution was ensured.8 We specifically chose a Au–Ag-based system
because alloy formation is thermodynamically favorable at all compositions
and the lattice spacings of Au and Ag closely match.33 Because the nanorods are single-crystalline, this model
system is well-suited to specifically study the kinetics of metal
redistribution during alloying. To this end, we performed both in situ TEM and in situ EXAFS measurements,
yielding sub-nanometer, single-particle and atomic, ensemble-averaged
information, respectively. In addition, we validated the in
situ measurements with ex situ measurements
carried out in the absence of an electron or X-ray beam. In particular,
we addressed the influence of the metal composition (Au–Ag
ratio) on the alloying temperature of the Au-core, Ag-shell nanorods.
We unambiguously showed the influence of the metal composition on
the kinetics of the alloying process. Increasing Ag content led to
slower metal redistribution, a trend that is opposite to the dependence
of the melting temperature on the Au–Ag ratio. In addition,
indications for size-dependent alloying were found where a decrease
in particle volume led to lower alloying temperatures. We developed
a simple theoretical model that correctly predicts the temperatures
and time scales for metal redistribution as a function of particle
volume and composition. Our study not only demonstrates a general,
multiscale approach to monitoring metal redistribution in bimetallic
nanoparticles but also reveals the influence of fundamental parameters
governing metal redistribution, which is of importance in bimetallic
nanoparticle applications.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Core–Shell
Nanorods
Mesoporous
silica-coated Au-core, Ag-shell nanorods (Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs)
with similar volumes but with three different Au-to-Ag ratios were
colloidally synthesized. The colloidal synthesis was performed on
a relatively large (milligram) scale to obtain the required amount
of sample needed for the EXAFS measurements. To this end, the Ag-shell
growth as described by Deng et al., comprising the reduction of Ag+ ions on the Au nanorods by ascorbic acid, was performed in
an acidified, instead of neutral, aqueous solution.9 The presence of H+ ions slowed the Ag-shell
growth down considerably (from seconds to minutes), resulting in sufficiently
long mixing times for the reagents and homogeneous Ag-shell growth.
To limit the variation in particle volume when changing the Au-to-Ag
ratios of the particles, both the core and the shell size of the Au
core and Ag shell were varied. In this way, 3 batches of mesoporous
silica coated Au-core Ag-shell NRs with an average atomic Ag fraction XAg of 0.20, 0.46, and 0.70 and an average particle
volume V of 2.2, 4.1, and 5.6 × 104 nm3, respectively, were obtained. To also investigate
the influence of the particle volume on the atomic redistribution,
a batch of considerably smaller Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs with an
average of XAg = 0.46 and V = 0.7 × 104 nm3 was prepared.

In Table 1, we report a summary
of the sample details, and in Figure 1, we show the corresponding high annular dark-field
scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps. Due to the large Z contrast difference between Au and Ag atoms, the core–shell
structure of the nanorods is readily visible in the HAADF-STEM images.
The different Ag contents are most clearly seen in the EDX maps, in
which Au and Ag are depicted in red and green, respectively. The Si signal of the silica shell is
shown in Figure S1 together with the optical
spectra (Figure S2) and a high-resolution
TEM image showing the single crystalline structure of the nanorods
(Figure S3).

Direct Visualization of
Metal Redistribution in Individual Particles
with in Situ TEM
In situ TEM was used to visualize the atomic redistribution in individual
NRs with different Au-to-Ag ratios and volumes. To avoid variations
between in situ TEM measurements on different samples
due to, e.g., inequalities in the heating temperature
or differences in electron dose that are known to be important in in situ electron microscopy,28−30 we chose to compare
four different samples in one measurement under exactly the same conditions.
To achieve this, a mixture of the four samples with different Au-to-Ag
ratios and particle volumes was deposited on a single SiNx chip. The heating experiment was carried out in
a high vacuum with a ramp of 3 °C/min. EDX analysis was used
to map the Au and Ag metal distribution as a function of temperature.

Figure 2a shows
the EDX maps of the mixture of Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs at various
temperatures. The EDX maps of the orange, red, gray, and blue highlighted
NRs in Figure 2a are
enlarged in Figure 2b. We determined the Ag fractions and particle volumes of these individual
nanorods, which were slightly different from the average values in Table 1: XAg = 0.44 V = 0.45 × 104 nm3 (orange), XAg = 0.45 V = 5.0 × 104 nm3 (black), XAg = 0.24 V = 3.0 × 104 nm3 (red), and XAg = 0.68 V = 2.7 × 104 nm3 (blue). To precisely track the metal redistribution in these individual
nanorods during the heating process, we determined the core-to-shell
ratio from the core and shell diameter for each particle at each temperature
(see Figure S4 for details on the analysis
procedure). From the core-to-shell ratios we derived the degree of
alloying at the different heating temperatures, which increases from
0 to 1 when going from a core–shell to an alloyed nanorod.
In Figure 2c, we plot
the alloying curves of the black and orange highlighted single particles
as a function of temperature for the 2 particles with the same Au–Ag
ratio but have a differing particle volume by a factor of 10. The
plot in Figure 2d shows
the individual alloying curves of the particles in red, black, and
blue, which have a similar volume but different Au-to-Ag ratios. We
defined the alloying temperature Talloy as the temperature at which the degree of alloying reached 0.5,
which was 392, 394, 436, and 451 °C for the rods with XAg = 0.24, 0.44, 0.45, and 0.68, respectively.

data. The heating ramp was set to 3 °C/min.

These in situ TEM measurements clearly show
the
impact of the particle volume and the metal composition on the atomic
redistribution, where a decrease in particle volume and Ag content
led to significantly lower alloying temperatures. Lowering of the
particle volume by a factor 10 (from V = 5.0 ×
104 nm3 to 0.45 × 104 nm3) resulted in a decrease in alloying temperature of 42 °C,
whereas the influence of the particle volume for larger NRs with V = 1.3 to 3.0 × 104 nm3 was
negligible (Figure S5). The considerable
drop in the alloying temperature when decreasing the particle volume
to V = 0.45 × 104 nm3,
and the diameter of the nanorod below 20 nm indicates an increased
atom mobility at smaller particle dimensions. Such a size effect is
in line with the previously reported particle-size-dependent melting
of silica encapsulated AuNPs, in which the melting point decreased
drastically from ∼900 to 300 °C when decreasing the (spherical)
particle diameter from 20 to 1.5 nm.34

From EDX maps and corresponding alloying curves in Figure 2b,d, it is clear that the atomic
redistribution is also strongly influenced by the Au–Ag ratio:
the Au@Ag@SiO2 NR with the XAg = 0.68 alloyed at almost 50 °C higher than the one with XAg = 0.24. Despite the fact that the rod with XAg = 0.68 had a volume 2 times smaller than
that of the rod with XAg = 0.45, the increase
in Ag content led to a significantly higher alloying temperature.

Ensemble-Averaged Atomic Redistribution from in Situ EXAFS
To investigate the impact of the metal composition
on the atomic redistribution for a larger number of particles, we
moved from in situ TEM to in situ EXAFS and extended our study from a femtogram to a milligram scale
and from a single particle to 1019 particles. Additionally, in situ EXAFS measurements allowed the dosing of gases combined
with a reliable temperature control. The unconventionally fast switching
between the metal absorption edges (<1 min) at the ROCK beamline
of the SOLEIL synchrotron made it possible to follow the atomic redistribution
at the Au and Ag absorption edges in the same experiment. The alloying
experiments were carried out under inert conditions in a He flow because
the presence of oxygen is known to significantly change the alloying
process.8

The in situ EXAFS data of the atomic redistribution in the Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs with the lowest and highest Ag content, XAg = 0.20 and 0.70, are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a–d shows the normalized μ(E) spectra and χ(k) spectra acquired at the
Au L3 and Ag K absorption edges of the NRs with XAg = 0.70. The oxidation state of the Au and
Ag atoms in the core and in the shell of the NRs before heating was
determined from the XAFS spectra at room temperature (RT) and found
to be predominately metallic (Figure S6). The in situ EXAFS spectra show a clear change
when heating the NRs from 30 to 500 °C. To verify if metal redistribution
took place, we used the EXAFS spectra before and after thermal treatment
to calculate the coordination numbers between the Au and Ag atoms: NAu–Au, NAu–Ag, NAg–Ag, and NAg–Au. Table 2 lists the coordination numbers for both samples. Due
to the core–shell structure of the NRs, the coordination numbers
between unlike atoms are low before heating. As expected, NAg–Au is lowest for core–shell
particles with the highest XAg. After
heating of the core–shell NRs to 500 °C, NAg–Au and NAu–Ag increased by a factor of ≥6, indicating that mixing of the
two elements took place in both samples. A full overview of the EXAFS
fitting parameters is given in Tables S1–S4.

from 30 to 500 °C. The plots in panels e and f show the degree
of alloying and the derivative thereof as a function of temperature
and were obtained by performing linear combination fitting on the
normalized μ(E) spectra at the Ag K edge (XAg = 0.20, red) and Au L3 edge (XAg = 0.70, blue). The EXAFS spectra were acquired
during heating to 500 °C with 3 °C/min in a 25 mL/min He
flow.

a Based on the coordination numbers,
the corresponding J values were calculated.

To estimate if the NRs were fully
alloyed, meaning that the Au
and Ag atoms were randomly dispersed within the particles, the extent
of alloying (J) was calculated following the approach
developed by Hwang et al.:14 1  

The J values of the two components (Au and Ag)
give information on the internal distribution of the two components.14 To calculate Prandom, the Au-to-Ag ratios as determined by EDX were used. In Table 2, the J values for the two different NR samples before and after heating
to 500 °C are given. For both alloyed samples, the calculated JAu and JAg values
are close to 100, indicating that the NRs are likely to have a fully
alloyed structure when heating them to 500 °C.

To deduce
the evolution of the alloying process from all the spectra
acquired between 30 and 500 °C, we performed linear combination
fitting on the normalized μ(E) spectra. In
(E)XAFS analysis, linear combination fitting is typically used to
determine and follow changes in the oxidation state of metal nanoparticles
but is not common for following metal redistribution. Note that a
linear combination fitting based analysis is considerably faster than
calculation of the coordination numbers, which is especially important
when analyzing a large number of EXAFS spectra.

In our analysis,
each EXAFS spectrum at a given temperature was
compared to the spectrum of the initial core–shell and final
alloyed state for which the spectra at 30 and 500 °C were taken,
respectively. As shown in Figure 3e, the analysis was successfully applied to obtain
the degree of alloying as a function of temperature. Figure 3e specifically shows the linear
combination fitting results determined from the Ag K edge for the XAg = 0.20 sample and the Au L3 edge
for the XAg = 0.70 sample because the
change from core–shell to alloyed state is most apparent on
the edge of the least abundant metal. In addition, it is important
to note that the linear combination fitting analysis is also sensitive
to changes that are not due to metal redistribution, such as the damping
of the EXAFS spectra due to thermal disorder with increasing temperature.
This temperature contribution predominately plays a role when the
change upon alloying is small, as is the case for the absorption edge
of the metal that is in the majority (Figures S7 and S8).

From Figure 3e,
the alloying temperature determined at a degree of alloying of 0.5,
was 287 and 334 °C for the sample with XAg = 0.20 and 0.70, respectively. The EXAFS measurements thus
confirmed the increase in alloying temperature with increasing Ag
content, as observed in the in situ TEM but now for
a large ensemble of particles. However, it should be noted that there
is a discrepancy in alloying temperatures: from the in situ EXAFS, we obtained ∼100 °C lower alloying temperatures
compared with the in situ TEM data. This discrepancy
demonstrates the need for ex situ measurements to
establish the absolute temperature at which the metal redistribution
occurs in the absence of an electron or X-ray beam.

Validation
of the in Situ Data
Although
electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy enable the in situ observation of structural changes in metal nanoparticles,
it is crucial to validate these techniques with ex situ measurements. In particular, electron beam irradiation has been
reported to induce anomalous behavior in nanostructured materials
and significantly alter the deformation behavior, growth kinetics,
and the structure of the nanoparticles during in situ studies.28−30 To verify the dependence of the alloying temperature
on the Au-to-Ag ratio, as observed in in situ TEM
and in situ EXAFS, ex situ measurements
were carried out by heating the NRs in a furnace. Herein, we used
the same heating ramp of 3 °C/min to heat to 250, 300, 325, 350,
375, and 400 °C in N2, after which each sample was
analyzed with HAADF-STEM and EDX (Figure S9). In every sample and for each temperature, four representative
rods were analyzed with EDX to determine their core-to-shell ratios
and their compositions, which were close to the average sample compositions,
as given in Table 1. From the core-to-shell ratio, the degree of alloying was calculated
in the same way as described for the in situ TEM
measurements, and the degree of alloying is shown as a function of
the heating temperature in Figure 4a. It shows that the Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs with
average XAg values of 0.17, 0.46, and
0.72 alloy at 305, 345, and 375 °C, respectively. The EDX maps
in Figure S9 show that all Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs of the same composition simultaneously convert from a
core–shell to the alloyed state.

Each point is an average of four particles. The alloying temperatures
for the Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs with XAg = 0.17 (red), 0.46 (black), and 0.72 (blue) was 305, 345, and 375
°C, respectively. The samples were heated in a N2 flow
with a heating ramp of 3 °C/min. (b) A summary of the alloying
temperature as a function of Ag fraction determined with in
situ TEM (dark blue), ex situ TEM (orange),
and in situ EXAFS (green). Curves are best fit to
the experimental data.

In Figure 4b, an
overview of the alloying temperatures versus the Ag content for all
three techniques is shown. The ex situ data nicely
support the trends observed in the in situ TEM and in situ EXAFS measurements. In all three techniques, the
alloying temperature increases with increasing Ag content, and only
the absolute temperatures vary. The ex situ TEM measurements
match the EXAFS results, but the alloying temperatures determined
by in situ TEM are 75–90 °C too high.
The relatively high alloying temperatures from the in situ TEM measurements could be related to an altered heat conductivity
in the SiNX chip after depositing the
nanorods combined with possible carbon contamination, leading to inaccurate
temperatures in the heating chip. Alternatively, the strongly reducing
electron beam could have influenced the kinetics of the alloying process,
but we did not observe significant differences in the alloying process
between areas that were or were not illuminated with the electron
beam prior to the heating. Thus, although care should be taken in
deducing quantitative data from in situ TEM, it is
a powerful technique in providing a qualitative insight in the metal
redistribution for single nanoparticles and correctly shows the dependency
of the metal redistribution on the metal composition for different
nanoparticles.

For all Au–Ag compositions, the observed
alloying temperatures
are far below the bulk melting point of Au and Ag, which points at
a nanosize effect on the alloying process and enhanced atom mobilities
compared to the bulk. Size effects have been observed for the melting
temperatures of nanoparticles, where the melting point was significantly
lowered when decreasing the nanostructure size.34−36 Analogously,
the observed lowering of the alloying temperature can be explained
by a lowering in cohesive energy, which is the binding strength of
the atom with its neighbors, with increasing particle surface to volume
ratio.37,38 Because the cohesive energy is proportional
to the vacancy formation energy and activation energy of diffusion,
it is to be expected that the mobility of atoms and the rate of alloying
increases for smaller nanostructures, leading to lower alloying temperatures.
When decreasing the particle diameter below 5 nm, even spontaneous
alloying of bimetallic Au–Ag nanoparticles at room temperature
can occur.39

It should be noted that
the observed trend between the alloying
temperature and metal composition in the Au–Ag nanoparticles
varies oppositely to the composition dependency in the melting point
temperature, where Tmelting,Ag = 962 and Tmelting,Au = 1064 °C. A similar trend for
atomic diffusion was measured in bulk Au–Ag crystals.40 The activation energy of diffusion for both
Au and Ag atoms in Au–Ag alloys was reported to increase with
increasing Ag fraction going from 1.74 to 1.93 eV for Ag atoms in
pure Au and Ag and 1.81 to 2.09 eV for Au atoms in pure Au and Ag.40 From these activation energies, it follows that
Ag atoms are more mobile than Au atoms but that the diffusion of both
Au and Ag atoms is slower in high-Ag-content Au–Ag alloys.
A possible explanation for this phenomenon can be derived from the
energy of vacancy formation and atom migration, which are known to
be higher in Ag compared to Au: E(vacancy formation)Ag = 1.10 eV, E(vacancy formation)Au= 0.97 eV, E(atom migration)Ag(in)Ag =
0.83 eV, and E(atom migration)Ag(in)Au = 0.77 eV.40−42 Because atomic diffusion in Au–Ag crystals
is known to go via vacancy-hopping, a lower number of vacancies and
a higher energy cost for hopping into the vacancies with increasing
Ag content could explain the observed retardation of Au and Ag in
high-content Ag alloys. In addition to Au–Ag, similar trends
of self-diffusion dependency opposite to melting temperature have
been reported for, e.g., Ag–Mn,43 Ti−Cr,44,45 and Tl–Pb
bulk crystals.46 In this study, we show
experimental proof of this trend at the nanoscale.

Modeling Atomic
Redistribution
We devised a simple
model that can correctly describe the diffusion in Au–Ag nanoparticles
as a function of temperature and composition. We numerically calculate
the diffusion of Au atoms nAu and Ag atoms nAg passing through a static Au–Ag interface
per time step Δt according to Fick’s
first law: 2  where A is the interface
area, r the radius of the NP, D0Ag the frequency factor, QAg the activation energy, R the gas constant, T the temperature, CcoreAg the
silver concentration of the core, and CshellAg the silver
concentration of the shell (expressed in atoms per cubic meter). An
analogous formula holds for the Au atoms. The rate of diffusion was
calculated iteratively, where D0, Q, and the concentration difference Ccore – Cshell were updated
every time step. The frequency factor D0 and activation energy for diffusion Q depend on
the Au–Ag composition and have been measured experimentally
in bulk crystals.40 We corrected these
composition-dependent bulk D0 and Q values for the NP size according to the model of Guisbiers
et al.47,48 Herein, the activation energy of diffusion
in NPs QNP was derived from the activation
energy of diffusion in the bulk Qbulk by
using a so-called shape factor αshape, which, among
others, depends on the surface-to-volume ratio of the NPs. More details
on the calculation of the αshape factor can be found in the Experimental section.
For the Au–Ag NRs used in this study, the correction of Qbulk to QNP, resulted
in alloy temperatures of ∼50 °C lower compared with bulk
crystals of the same Au–Ag composition.

The resulting
theoretical predictions for the alloying curves of the in
situ EXAFS measurements are shown in Figure 5a. The theoretical predictions are in very
good agreement with the experimental in situ EXAFS
data, and the alloying temperatures as predicted by the model, 286
and 346 °C for the XAg = 0.20 and
0.70, respectively, match the experimental values of 287 and 334 °C
closely. In Figure 5b, we show the theoretical prediction for the alloying curves of
Au–Ag NRs with V = 4 × 104 nm3 and XAg = 0.2–0.8.
In the calculation of these curves a heating ramp of 3 °C/min
was considered, as in the experimental studies. The theoretical predictions
clearly demonstrate the importance of including the dependency of
the diffusion on the metal composition. We stress that it is remarkable
that the metal composition still plays such a crucial role in the
diffusion kinetics in nanoparticles, in which size and shape have
generally been considered to play the most-important role,12,33,47 and the influence of the particle
composition has therefore been neglected so far.

Conclusions
We have used a multitechnique approach
to precisely follow metal
redistribution, a process crucial in catalysis, in situ, and at different length scales. A combination of in situ TEM with in situ EXAFS validated with ex
situ measurements provided both a single particle and ensemble-averaged
characterization. Our well-defined model system, consisting of mesoporous
silica-coated, single-crystalline Au-core Ag-shell nanorods of tunable
size and composition, allowed a systematic study of the nanoparticle
composition on the atomic redistribution kinetics. We unambiguously
showed that the atomic diffusion in Au–Ag nanoparticles strongly
depends on the composition, a trend that has been observed in bulk
crystals but that has, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported
for nanomaterials. Additionally, we find indications for a nanoscale
effect on the alloying process, leading to lower alloying temperatures
when decreasing the nanoparticle size. Finally, we show that to correctly
model metal redistribution in metallic nanoparticles, not only the
nanoscale dimensions but also the metal composition should be taken
into account. Both our experimental approach and the theoretical model
are likely to apply to a wide range of bimetallic nanoparticle-based
materials.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All
chemicals were used as received without
further purification. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, >98.0%)
and sodium oleate (NaOL, >97.0%) were purchased from TCI America.
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (HAuCl4·3 H2O) and sodium hydroxide (98%) were purchased from Acros Organics. l-Ascorbic Acid (BioXtra, ≥ 99%), silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥ 99%), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99%),
hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt % in water), tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS, 98%), and ammonium hydroxide solution (≥25 wt % in water)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultrapure water (Millipore Milli-Q
grade) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ was used in all of the
experiments. All glassware for the AuNR synthesis was cleaned with
fresh aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 in a 3:1 volume ratio), rinsed
with large amounts of water and dried at 100 °C before usage.

Synthesis of the Au–Ag Nanorods
A total of three
batches of Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs with average Ag atomic fractions
of 0.20, 0.46, and 0.70 were prepared by changing both the Au-core
size and the Ag-shell thickness. The synthesis of the AuAg core–shell
rods consists of four steps: AuNR synthesis (1), mesoporous silica
coating (2), partial etching of AuNRs within their mesoporous silica
shells (3), and Ag-shell growth on the etched AuNRs (4).

In
the first step, monodisperse AuNRs were synthesized according to the
protocol of Ye et al.49 A pair of 500 mL
scale syntheses were carried out with growth solutions containing
7.0 g of CTAB, 1.24 g of NaOL, 25 mL of MQ H2O, and 250
mL of 1.0 mM HAuCl4; 7.2 mL of AgNO3; 2.1 mL
of concentrated HCl; 64 mM ascorbic acid; and 1.0 mL of seed solution. The seeds were prepared
from 10 mL of 0.10 M CTAB, 51 μL of HAuCl4 and 1.0
mL of NaBH4. The subsequent rod growth was performed under
static conditions in a 30 °C water bath overnight. The resulting
AuNR suspensions had an absorption maximum of 4.0 at λ(LSPR)
= 866 and 853 nm. The rods were centrifuged at 8000 rcf for 30 min
(Rotina 380R Hettich centrifuge), washed with H2O, and
redispersed in 5.0 mM CTAB H2O.

In the second step,
the CTAB stabilized AuNRs were coated with
a 18 nm mesoporous silica shell via the method of Gorelikov et al.32 The coating was performed in 350 mL of 1.5 mM
CTAB aqueous solution containing 1.0 mM NaOH and an AuNR concentration
corresponding to a absorption maximum of 10. During magnetic stirring
at 300 rpm in a 30 °C water bath, 3 times 1.05 mL of 20 vol %
TEOS in EtOH were added with a 30 min time interval. The Au@SiO2 NRs were centrifuged at 8000 rcf for 30 min and washed with
water and ethanol.

The third step, oxidative etching of the
Au@SiO2 NRs,
was performed by following the procedure described by Deng et al.9 but with H2O2 as an oxidant
instead of O2 from air. Different core sizes were obtained
by varying the etching time. For the rods with XAg = 0.20, 240 mL of AuNRs in MeOH (Abs = 6.0) were heated
to 60 °C in an oil bath while magnetically stirring at 400 rpm
with 4.8 mL of HCl (37%) and 4.8 mL of H2O2 (0.2
wt %). The LSPR peak position changed from 838 to 822 nm after etching
for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by putting the mixture in a
4 °C water bath and diluting it with 200 mL of ice-cold MeOH
before centrifugation at 10000 rcf for 20 min. The etched rods were
washed with and redispersed in EtOH. For batches with XAg = 0.46 and 0.70, 210 mL of AuNRs in MeOH, 4.8 mL of
HCl (37%), and 4.8 mL of H2O2 (0.2 wt %) were
added. After 13 and 26 min, 100 mL of reaction mixture was quenched
with 100 mL of ice-cold MeOH and was as described above. The LSPR
peak positions of the rods were 750 and 694 nm.

Finally, the
procedure by Deng et al. was modified to do the Ag
overgrowth in large reaction volumes (≫ 1 mL). HCl was added
to lower the Ag reduction rate by ascorbic acid and allows for a homogeneous
shell growth on all particles. The rods with XAg = 0.20 were prepared by adding 2.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl, 3.0
mL of 5.0 mM AgNO3, and 3.0 mL of 20 mM ascorbic acid were
added to 200 mL of aqueous AuNR suspension (Abs = 4.5, LSPR = 780
nm) while stirring vigorously. The rods with XAg = 0.70 were prepared in 2 steps. To 120 mL of rod suspension
was added 1.2 mL of 0.1 M HCl, 6.6 mL of 5.0 mM AgNO3,
and 6.6 mL of 20 mM ascorbic acid. After washing with MQ H2O, a second Ag-overgrowth step was performed to increase the Ag content.
To 100 mL of aqueous Au@Ag@SiO2 NR suspension (Abs = 1.2,
LSPR = 701 nm), 1.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl, 4.0 mL of 5.0 mM AgNO3, and 4.0 mL of 20 mM ascorbic acid were added. The XAg = 0.46 sample was prepared on a smaller scale because
it was only used for the ex situ and in situ TEM measurements. To 1.0 mL of aqueous Au@SiO2 NRs suspension
(Abs = 2.5, LSPR = 745 nm), 10 μL of 0.1 M HCl, 40 μL
of 5.0 mM AgNO3, and 40 μL of 20 mM ascorbic acid
were added.

All Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs were washed with MQ
H2O and ethanol, redispersed in ethanol, and stored at
4 °C to
prevent oxidation and dissolution of the Ag shell. The centrifugation
speed varied between 6000 and 8000 rcf depending on the volume of
the rods. The samples were dried at 60 °C in air. All samples
were characterized with visible–near-infrared spectroscopy
and TEM.

In Situ TEM
The in situ heating measurements were carried out on a FEI Talos F200X operated
at 200 kV using a heating holder from DENSsolutions. A mix of four
different batches of Au@Ag@SiO2 NRs was drop-cast on a
heating chip (Wildfire Nanochip) with silicon nitride windows. The
overall heating ramp was set to 3 °C/min. EDX maps were acquired
at 25, 250, 300, and 350 °C and from 400 to 650 °C with
a 25 °C temperature interval. The acquisition time per EDX map
was 5 min, and the probe current was 700 pA. In the intervals between
the EDX acquisitions, the beam was blanked to minimize the influence
of the electron beam on the alloying process. Different SiN windows
were checked during heating that were not illuminated prior to heating.
No significant differences in alloying kinetics were observed between
the illuminated and non-illuminated spots. The SiN chip was plasma
was cleaned for 10 s in a 20% O2 in an Ar atmosphere before
the TEM experiment.

In Situ EXAFS
The in situ EXAFS measurements were performed at the ROCK beamline
of the SOLEIL
synchrotron. At this beamline, continuous switching between the Au
L3 edge (11919 eV) and the Ag K edge (25514 eV) is possible
(time to switch ∼1 min) using two Quick-XAS monochromators
equipped with Si(111) and Si(220) channel-cut crystals, respectively.
The operation parameters of the monochromators were set to record
two EXAFS spectra per second. The powdered samples were loaded in
a stainless steel sample holder (with a depth of 1 mm) allowing temperature
control and gas flow. The XAg = 0.20 and
0.70 Au@Ag@SiO2 NR samples were diluted with boron nitride.
The heating was done in a He flow of 25 mL/min and with a heating
rate of 3 °C/min. Before and after heating, EXAFS spectra were
collected for 500 s at each edge at room temperature and averaged.
During the temperature ramps, alternate measurements at both edges
were performed continuously: spectra were collected and averaged for
35 s at the Au edge and 60 to 120 s at the Ag edge, depending on the
quality of the Ag signal. Measurements were done in transmission mode
using ionization chambers as detectors. Energy calibration was ensured
by the simultaneous measurement of the absorption spectra of metallic
Au and Ag foils.

Spectra analysis was conducted with the IFEFFIT
library using the GUI Athena and Artemis.50 All spectra were energy calibrated to the first inflection point
of the Ag or Au foil at 25 514 and 11 919 eV, respectively.
EXAFS signal was extracted in Athena with a R = 1.0
cutoff and a k weight of 2 and Fourier transformed
using a Hanning window in k = 3 and dk = 1. EXAFS analysis was conducted in Artemis with the normalized
spectra exported from Athena. The amplitude reduction factor (S02) of 0.83 for Ag and 0.79 for Au was obtained by fitting the EXAFS
data of the respective metal foils. The simulation of scattering paths
for the bi-metallic samples was performed with the ATOMS algorithm
with a custom input file created by substituting Au atoms by Ag in
the first shell to obtain the closest rational fraction of atoms.
A correction factor was introduced to S02 to obtain the
actual sample composition. Structural parameters were determined by
multiple k-weight least-squares fitting, and the
goodness of fit was determined by observing the reduced χ2 and R2 statistical parameters.
The linear combination fitting was carried out in Athena on the normalized
μ(E) spectra in the region between −20
to 120 eV from the absorption edge.

Ex situ Heating
The ex situ heating experiments
were performed in a tubular oven (Thermolyne
79300 tube furnace) under a constant N2 flow. The three
different samples were each drop-cast on a copper TEM grid (200 mesh
copper (100), Formvar/carbon film) and heated in a ceramic cup placed
in a quartz oven tube. The heating rate was always 3 °C/min,
and the particles were heated to 250, 300, 325, 350, 375, and 400
°C and cooled under N2 to room temperature before
taking them out of the oven. After heating, all samples were analyzed
with HAADF and EDX on a FEI Talos F200X, operated under the same conditions
as described above.

Diffusion Model
To predict the rate
of alloying in
Au–Ag nanoparticles, we numerically calculated Fick’s
first law. The number of Au, nAu, and
Ag atoms, nAg, diffusing through the static
Au–Ag interface per time step was calculated with eq 2. After each step, the Au-to-Ag
ratio of the core and the shell was updated, affecting D0, Q, Ccore, and Cshell in eq 2. The values for D0 and Q for silver and gold diffusing into various
Au–Ag compositions were taken from the work of Mallard et al.40 These bulk values of D0 and Q were corrected for NP size effects
according to the model of Guisbiers,47,48 in which the
change in activation energy for a NP compared to the activation energy
in the bulk can be described as: 3  where the shape factor αshape is
given by:47 4  Here, D is the diameter of
the NP; γs,l are the surface energies in the solid
and the liquid phases, respectively; S the surface
area of the NP; V the volume of the NP; and ΔHm,∞ the bulk
melting enthalpy.

Lastly, the temperature was updated every
time step according to the temperature ramp used in the experiments.
Usually, one time step was 1 s, which ensured small changes in the
Au–Ag content per time step for the temperatures used in this
work. Subsequent time steps were evaluated until the core and shell
consist of the same Au–Ag composition, when a full alloy composition
is reached. Only geometric input parameters determined from TEM such
as the core–shell volume, the interface and surface area and
the radius of the NP were needed for the calculations.
