Here
we show that the active portion of a graphitic nanoparticle
can be mimicked by a perylene diimide (PDI) to explain the otherwise
elusive biological and electrocatalytic activity of the nanoparticle
construct. Development of molecular analogues that mimic the antioxidant
properties of oxidized graphenes, in this case the poly(ethylene glycolated)
hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG–HCCs), will afford important
insights into the highly efficient activity of PEG–HCCs and
their graphitic analogues. PEGylated perylene diimides (PEGn–PDI) serve as well-defined molecular analogues
of PEG–HCCs and oxidized graphenes in general, and their antioxidant
and superoxide dismutase-like (SOD-like) properties were studied.
PEGn–PDIs have two reversible reduction
peaks, which are more positive than the oxidation peak of superoxide
(O2•–). This is similar to the
reduction peak of the HCCs. Thus, as with PEG–HCCs, PEGn–PDIs are also strong single-electron
oxidants of O2•–. Furthermore,
reduced PEGn–PDI, PEGn–PDI•–, in the presence
of protons, was shown to reduce O2•– to H2O2 to complete the catalytic cycle in
this SOD analogue. The kinetics of the conversion of O2•– to O2 and H2O2 by PEG8–PDI was measured using freeze-trap
EPR experiments to provide a turnover number of 133 s–1; the similarity in kinetics further supports that PEG8–PDI is a true SOD mimetic. Finally, PDIs can be used as catalysts
in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in water, which proceeds
by a two-electron process with the production of H2O2, mimicking graphene oxide nanoparticles that are otherwise
difficult to study spectroscopically.

==== Body
Superoxide
dismutase (SOD) is
a metalloenzyme that controls the fluxes of the partially reduced
products of molecular O2 or reactive oxygen species (ROS)
during the cycle of molecular O2 in biological systems.1−3 ROS are involved in the progression of aging as well as a variety
of acute and chronic diseases such as cancer and vascular diseases.4−6 Superoxide is a radical anion (O2•–) that is the primary ROS produced by direct single-electron reduction
of molecular O2.7 Subsequent
proton-coupled reduction of O2•– would lead to the other secondary members of ROS such as hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), organic peroxides (ROOH), hydroperoxyl
radical (HO2•) and hydroxyl radical (HO•).8−10 In aprotic solvents, O2•– is stable and exhibits reversible outer-sphere electron-transfer
(ET) behavior. However, in the presence of protons, O2•– proceeds quickly to form secondary ROS through
consecutive proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. SOD
possesses the combination of redox-active metal centers and ligand
environments that catalytically dismutate 2 O2•– into O2 and H2O2: 2 O2•– + 2 H+ → O2 + H2O2.3

There have been many efforts to synthesize molecular organometallic
complexes that can mimic the catalytic cycle of SOD.11−13 Over the past two decades, many high-valent metal complexes have
been studied to gain fundamental insights into the structural, functional
and mechanistic aspects of the enzymes and their counterparts.14−17 Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that ET occurs through either
inner-sphere or outer-sphere mechanisms and the M–O2•– species is an important reactive intermediate
formed via the inner-sphere mechanism.18 However, another class of effective inhibitors of ROS are antioxidants
that are purely organic molecules.19,20 Organic molecule
ET mechanisms are generally complex and in most cases they occur through
a continuum of mixed inner-sphere and outer-sphere mechanisms.21,22

Recently, we developed metal-free carbon nanomaterials, poly(ethylene
glycolated) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG–HCCs, Scheme 1), which show highly
efficient catalytic conversion of O2•– into O2 and H2O2 (eqs 1 and 2) that
rivals that of bovine Cu/Zn SOD, the most efficient native SOD enzyme.23

Scheme 1 Synthesis of PEG–HCCs from SWCNTs
as the Starting Material
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are oxidatively
disintegrated
and split open to form graphene domains that are 3 nm × 35 nm
with large amounts of oxidized functionalities that make the carbon
system extremely electron deficient.24 They
have been extensively characterized by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), dynamic light scattering, Raman spectroscopy (confirming the
loss of the tubular form through complete diminution of the radial
breathing modes), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and further
tested for in vitro and in vivo toxicity and biological activity as
antioxidants.25−32 The HCCs also bear, on average, one unpaired electron per nanoparticle
and the nanoparticle radical is air stable.23 As we have shown previously, HCCs can efficiently oxidize O2•– into O2, one of the
two half-reactions processes (eq 1) seen in SOD, and this might also be the rate-determining
step of the SOD catalytic cycle.24 This
is followed by reduction of O2•– in the presence of water to form H2O2 (eq 2). 1   2  In this work, we
report poly(ethylene glycolated)
perylene diimide (PEGn–PDI) as
an example of small molecular analogues of PEG–HCCs, and more
generally well-defined highly oxidized graphene analogues. In our
previous work using HCC as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR),24 we showed that proton
transfer steps are much faster than the electron-transfer steps, and
here we use the same technique to evaluate the involvement of proton
transfer steps during the dismutation of O2•– using the well-defined carbon core molecule PDI in PEGn–PDI. The understanding of graphene-based
catalysts can benefit from the study of molecular analogues, and we
propose that PDI serves as a simplified model of oxidized graphenes.

Results
and Discussion
PEGn-PDI and
Its Reactions with
Superoxide
PDI was identified as an electron deficient molecular
analogue of HCCs, and was further linked with two polyethylene glycol
(PEG) substituents for increased solubility in solvents such as water,
DMF and DMSO. Two different PEG units were used in this study, with
the shorter being three and the longer being eight ethylene glycol
units, PEG3–PDI and PEG8–PDI,
respectively (Figure 1). PEG3–PDI is less soluble in aqueous and organic
solvents; however, it is more suitable for crystallization and characterization
in the solid state, while PEG8–PDI has better solubility
therefore better suitability for characterization in the solution
state. Note that with PEG–HCCs, 5000 MW PEG was used in order
to make the nanoparticles soluble in phosphate buffered saline.33 Details of the synthetic procedure for preparation
of PEGn–PDIs and structural characterization
by NMR and X-ray crystallography can be found in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Structural formula of PEGn–PDI.

The electrochemical behavior of PDI is well-known and the
cyclic
voltammetry (CV) shows two reversible redox peaks in both neutral
organic and aqueous media.34 In DMSO, PEG8–PDI gave two redox values (E1 and E2) at −0.88 V and
−1.12 V versus Fc/Fc+ (Figure S1). Both redox potentials of PEG8–PDI are
more positive than the redox peak of O2•– (E = −1.25 V versus Fc/Fc+ in
DMSO)24 by 0.37 and 0.13 V, respectively.
This indicates that single-electron oxidation of O2•– to O2 by both PEG8–PDI
and PEG8–PDI•– are thermodynamically
favorable and exothermic processes, which is also the first half-reaction
of the SOD catalytic cycle. The HCC carbon core of the PEG–HCC
is the electron deficient redox center of the carbon nanoparticles,
and it has a broad reduction potential with the initial onset being
more positive by 0.60 V than the reduction peak of O2•– in aqueous media.24 This indicates that PEG8–PDI has comparable thermodynamic
ability to oxidize O2•– to the
oxidized graphene analogue PEG–HCC.

To further assess
the reactivity of PEG8–PDI
with O2•–, we monitored the optical
spectral changes upon the addition of O2•– to the solution of PEG8–PDI under inert atmosphere. Figure 2 (in red) shows the
optical spectrum of 0.04 mM PEG8–PDI (Figure S2) in DMSO with the major band at λ
= 525 nm (ε = 6.38 × 104 M–1 cm–1), typical for PDI derivatives in various
solvents.35 Upon addition of KO2 in small increments (0.0114 mM), the solution of PEG8–PDI shows a gradual change in color from red to greenish-blue,
which corresponds to the formation of an equimolar amount of the one-electron
reduced PEG8–PDI•–, with
the major band at λ = 710 nm (ε = 7.20 × 104 M–1 cm–1). Optical spectra of
PDI radical anions are known and well-documented.34,36 The gradual addition of another equivalent of KO2 results
in the further change in absorbance of PEG8–PDI•– to a purple color, with the major band at
λ = 568 nm (ε = 1.08 × 105 M–1 cm–1), which corresponds to the two-electron reduced
PEG8–PDI2– (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Spectral changes upon treatment of a 0.04 mM
DMSO solution of PEG8–PDI after the addition of
a DMSO solution of KO2 in small increments (0.0114 mM).
Red: PEG8–PDI,
greenish-blue: PEG8–PDI•–, purple: PEG8–PDI2–.

Interestingly, addition of extra amounts of KO2 to the
resultant dark-purple colored solution of PEG8–PDI2– does not result in any further changes. This is the
evidence that PEG8–PDI2– is persistent
in the presence of KO2 and does not exhibit additional
reduction steps. The two isosbestic points at λ = 559 nm and
then λ = 648 nm indicate the two successive single-step chemical
processes. Therefore, these optical observations provide evidence
that oxidation of O2•– to O2 in DMSO can be achieved by both PEG8–PDI
and PEG8–PDI•– through
the consecutive single electron-transfer mechanisms, according to
eq 3. 3a   3b  The other evidence for eq 3 is provided by electrochemical measurements. CV of PEG8–PDI exhibits two successive redox peaks (Figure 3), which corresponds
to two consecutive PEG8–PDI/PEG8–PDI•– and PEG8–PDI•–/PEG8–PDI2– couples.

Figure 3 CVs of 10 mM
of PEG8–PDI in DMSO under N2 after adding
incremental amounts of KO2 (20 μL
of KO2 in DMSO, 0.0114 mM stock) containing of 0.1 M [(n-Bu)4N]ClO4 as a supporting electrolyte
at 298 K with a glassy carbon working electrode and platinum wire
as quasi-reference electrode. Scan rate: 50 mV/s. The arrow indicates
the newly formed redox peak of the molecular O2. Color
code: KO2 concentration increased from black to red.

In addition to the color changes
of the solution, subsequent addition
of incremental amounts of KO2 to the solution of PEG8–PDI gives rise to the new CV curve centered at E = −1.23 V versus Fc/Fc+, as shown in Figure 3. The new peak at E = −1.23 V corresponds to the CV of dissolved molecular
O2, as supported by the disappearance of the peak upon
bubbling the solution with N2 for 5 min. Conversely, the
peak of dissolved KO2 in electrolyte without PEG8–PDI present is persistent for 6 h while bubbling with N2 (Figure S3).24 These electrochemical tests show that both PEG8–PDI and PEG8–PDI•– can oxidize O2•– to O2 through a single electron-transfer reaction (eq 3) and the product, molecular O2, can be observed
electrochemically. Furthermore, the reversible two consecutive 1e– redox peaks of PEG8–PDI upon addition
of KO2 nicely reveal the underlying mechanism of outer-sphere
ET from O2•– to PEG8–PDI and PEG8–PDI•–, where O2•– is a reductant.
Also, the symmetric size of the current on the reductive and oxidative
transition of PEG8–PDI in the presence of O2•– confirms the simple interpretation
of the outer-sphere ET mechanism.37

To examine the SOD-like activity of PEG8–PDI,
and to investigate whether the second-half reaction of SOD proceeds
analogous to eq 2, we
performed additional experiments to determine the reactivity of PEG8–PDI•– and PEG8–PDI2– with O2•– in the presence of protons (HClO4) in the aprotic environment
of DMSO. Both PEG8–PDI•– and PEG8–PDI2– served as reductants
of O2•– to H2O2 in the presence of 2 equiv of H+. But upon incremental
addition of substoichiometric amounts of HClO4 in DMSO,
the purple solution of PEG8–PDI2– in the presence of KO2 gradually changed color to red
(Figure 4). Through
analysis of UV/vis spectra taken immediately after the addition of
HClO4, the recovery of the initial PEG8–PDI
was achieved in 70% yield (Figure 4). The loss of the remaining 30% suggests that the
PEG8–PDI, PEG8–PDI•– or PEG8–PDI2– could be thermodynamically
unstable in the presence of H2O2, which is the
product of the second-half of the dismutase according to eqs 2, 4 and 5.

Figure 4 Absorption spectra of PEG8–PDI2– in DMSO (black curve) upon treatment with KO2 and HClO4 indicating the formation of H2O2 and
regeneration of original neutral PEG8–PDI (red curve)
proceeding via the PEG8–PDI•– (gray curve).

A separate experiment
where PEG8–PDI is treated
with H2O2 and HClO4 does not exhibit
any changes in the optical spectra (Figure S4), suggesting the persistent nature of PEG8–PDI
under these conditions, thus precluding reaction of PEG8–PDI with H2O2 as a reason for the depressed
yield. The fact that PEG8–PDI2– rapidly reacts according to eq 4 and immediately reforms stoichiometric amounts of PEG8–PDI•– as the product (Figure 4), also excludes
PEG8–PDI2– from being the source
for the decreased yields. However, PEG8–PDI•– reacts irreversibly with H2O2 and gradually forms a product with an optical spectrum uncharacteristic
of PEG8–PDI (Figure S5). This explains the loss of the 30% of the original PEG8–PDI during the second half of the SOD-mimetic step, where
PEG8–PDI•– reacts with
produced H2O2 via efficient PCET reaction mechanism
as shown in eq 6.38,39 4   5   6  Thus, these optical data provide
evidence
that PEG8–PDI mimics the catalytic cycle of SOD.

The kinetics of the reaction between O2•– and PEG8–PDI was measured using KO2 and a direct freeze-trap EPR steady-state kinetics assay rather
than the less efficient spin-trapping EPR which also loses kinetic
information. 18-Crown-6 was used to increase the solubility of KO2 in DMSO. In this case excess O2•– was used to estimate the intrinsic turnover number for O2•– conversion to O2 by PEG8–PDI. In order to slow down the self-dismutation of
superoxide in aqueous media to achieve reasonable initial concentrations
of O2•– in solution, we carried
out the kinetic experiments at pH 13 in 50 mM NaOH. PEG8–PDI is stable at pH 13 as there is no change of optical spectral
shape observed by 30 min preincubation. A control EPR sample was prepared
using this preincubated PEG8–PDI to react with 20
mM KO2 and freeze trapped. The amount of radical determined
is basically the same as that of fresh PEG8–PDI.

Figure 5a shows
that the total spin concentration of O2•– gradually increased with the amount of added KO2. As
expected, the concentration of O2•– decreased in the presence of PEG8–PDI. Therefore,
the consumption of O2•– by PEG8–PDI can be estimated from the difference between the
control, which does not contain any PEG8–PDI, and
subsequently recalculated as turnover numbers (defined as number of
moles of consumed O2•– per moles
of PEG8–PDI per second) with an average reaction
time of 10 s (Figure 5b). At the saturation behavior of [O2•–] the highest O2•– turnover rate
was estimated as 133 s–1, which is almost 1000×
lower than that of PEG–HCCs.23 This
is not surprising, as it is possible that the redox potential of the
two half reactions for PEG8–PDI are not as optimal
as PEG–HCCs24 or the electron transfer
kinetic barrier is higher than that of the PEG–HCCs. Overall,
the kinetics experiments indicate that PEG8–PDI
behaves similarly to SOD and PEG–HCCs as a “hit-and-run”
type reaction, where O2•– substrate
only momentarily stays in the active center, so the rate-limiting
step is not the binding but the oxidation/reduction of the O2•–.

O2•– total spin concentration

of obtained EPR spectra. For details, see Experimental
Methods. (b) The turnover number (TON) was calculated by subtracting
the amount of remaining O2•– from
the amount of O2•– in the control,
dividing by the amount of PEG8–PDI and then by 10
s for the reaction time (the average time required for manually freeze-trapping
each EPR sample). Two similar experiments performed using 1.5 μM
PEG8–PDI concentration yielded similar kinetic pattern.

Isolation and Characterization
of PEGn–PDI Radical Anions
PEG8–PDI•– as a reaction
intermediate was additionally
characterized by EPR spectroscopy. As with the optical measurements,
PEG8–PDI•– was generated
using stoichiometric (1:1) amounts of KO2 as a reductant
under inert atmosphere and it shows an EPR spectrum (g = 2.0019) with apparent 18 line hyperfine splitting caused by nitrogens
and protons (Figure 6). Simulation of the EPR spectrum reveals the delocalization of unpaired
spin over the entire π-conjugated unit of PDI with the following
hyperfine splitting: ring protons (n = 8): 1.2 G;
side chain protons (n = 4): 0.6 G; nitrogens (n = 2): 0.04 G, line width 0.23 G (Figures S6). The shape of the EPR spectra does not change substantially
with temperature, except slight broadening of the lines when the temperature
is lowered from 295 to 260 K. This is due to increased viscosity of
the solvent which could lead to changes in the electron spin distribution
and variation in coupling constants (Figure S7). However, further decrease in temperature of the sample results
in decrease of intensity and eventually loss of the EPR signal at
160 K as can be seen from Figure 6. π-Dimerization of the stable radical ions to
form weakly bonded dimeric species has been frequently considered
over the past decade.40−44

Figure 6 Variable-temperature
EPR spectra of PEG8–PDI•– obtained by reduction of PEG8–PDI
with equimolar amounts of KO2 in DMF.

Similarly, for PEG8–PDI•– the signal intensity decreases upon cooling the sample with the
gradual replacement of the paramagnetic monomer by the diamagnetic
π-dimer (Scheme 2). Intensity of signal (IEPR) and concentrations
were determined by double integration of the spectra. According to
the Curie law, IEPR = a × [M]/T, where a is a proportionality
factor, IEPR is proportional to the concentration
of the radical (PEG8–PDI•–) in the sample. Assuming that at room temperature the equilibrium
(Scheme 2) shifts to
the left and only monomeric radical anions exist in solution, and
using the proportionality ratio IEPR/IEPR298 = [M]/[M]298 =
α where α is a mole fraction of the monomeric radical
anion at a particular temperature, the equilibrium concentration of
the monomeric radical anion can be estimated at each temperature.
By using KA = (1 – α)/2[M]298α2 with an estimated α, it permits
calculation of the equilibrium constants for π-dimerization
at each temperature. Thermodynamic parameters for π-dimerization
of the monomeric radical anions were calculated by the least-squares
procedure from the linear relationship of ln(KA) and 1/T, resulting in the analysis pictured
in Figures S8.

Scheme 2 Reversible π-Dimerization
of PEGn–PDI•–
The thermodynamic parameters
ΔHD and ΔSD can be estimated as −7.7
kcal/mol and −17.1 e.u. respectively, which are close to the
values of thermodymanic parameters for π-dimerization in most
of the extended π-radicals.41 The
strong attraction of two unpaired electrons prevails over electrostatic
repulsion of two oppositely charged anions.

Interestingly, a
single crystal of the PEG3–PDI•– was obtained using cobaltocene as a reducing
agent. A green solution of the [PEG3–PDI•– CoCp+] in DMF was layered carefully with dry ethyl ether
and left in a freezer at −10 °C for 1 week and small dark-green-colored
crystalline needles were collected and subjected to X-ray crystallographic
analysis. Crystallographic analysis resulted in infinite π-stacked
PDI units of PEG3–PDI•– along the b-axis with close π–π
interactions of 3.36(2) Å as shown in Figure 7.

ORR Activity of PDIs
Knowing the properties of PDI
within PEGn–PDIs to be efficient
electron shuttle agents during the catalytic turnover of O2•–, and also that PDIs have redox potentials
close to that of molecular O2, we investigated the electocatalytic
properties of PDIs for their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.
Despite the fact that development of molecular catalysts for electrochemical
reduction of O2 has been an active research field, many
of the studied catalysts are high-valent organometallic complexes
while examples of pure organic molecules are scarce.45−47 A water-insoluble derivative of PDI, bis-2-ethylhexyl PDI (PDI-1, Figure S9) was immobilized on a glassy carbon
(GC) working electrode which served as an O2-electrode,
and it was tested in O2-saturated 0.1 M NaHPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer solution at pH 7. The comparison
spectra testing under both Ar and O2 reveal that under
Ar there is a very small reduction peak (Figure 8a). In contrast, PDI-1 under O2-saturated conditions results in a prominent cathodic ORR peak with
an onset potential of ∼0.40 V vs RHE (Figure 8a). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots
were obtained by using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) with varying
rotation rates to show the ORR electrocatalytic currents of PDI-1
(Figure 8b). Using
the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation, the kinetic current
density (Jk) was obtained and the electron-transfer
number (n, number of electrons exchanged per O2 molecule for the ORR) was estimated as shown in inset of Figure 8b.48 The n value was determined to be 1.9 at
a potential range from −0.20 to 0.20 V. This demonstrates that
the complete two-electron transfer reduction process of oxygen to
H2O2 proceeds according to eq 7. 7  The
ORR activity of PDI-1 is also evident
from the comparison in electrocatalytic reduction currents of the
GC substrate with the PDI-1 immobilized electrode (Figure S10). Higher ORR currents and larger differences in
the onset potential for the PDI-1-covered electrode than for the naked
GC electrode reveal that interference of the GC substrate in ORR performance
is negligible, in spite of the fact that O2 can be reduced
onto a GC electrode.49

collected at 100 mV s–1 using a GC working electrode

0.8 to −0.2 V while the ring electrode was held at 1.4 V. (d)
The number of electrons transferred and the H2O2 yield of PDI-1during ORR as calculated by ring currents.

These results show that there is a two-electron
ORR activity of
PDIs in aqueous media, as opposed to the single-electron transfer
process in organic solvents. However, the stability of PDI-1 shows
a small decline under ORR conditions (Figure S11), likely due to the production of aggressive radicals and H2O2 during ORR, which is likely to passivate the
electrode surface over extended cycling, similar to the H2O2-mediated decomposition of PEG8–PDI•– discussed above.

The accurate determination
of n, using the classic
Koutecky–Levich analysis shown above, depends on many factors,
including determination of the active surface area. Hence, we performed
additional electrochemical tests to support the ORR activity of PDI-1.
The yield of H2O2 and the potential range of
ORR operation were further measured by rotating disk electrode voltammetry
(RDEV) and rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry (RRDEV) as shown
in Figures 8c,d. Significant
increase in cathodic disk current was observed starting at 0.4 V,
while the disk potential was scanned from 0.8 to −0.2 V at
a constant ring electrode potential of 1.4 V. This is consistent with
the voltammograms in Figures 8a,b. Symmetric increase in ring current as in that of the
disk current (Figure 8c) indicates catalytic formation of H2O2 generated
at the disk.50 Using the differences in
the values between disk and ring currents, the value for n and the yield of H2O2 were estimated to be
3.0 and 40%, respectively (see Experimental Methods for the details of the calculations). The value for n and the yield of H2O2 during the electrocatalytic
ORR by PDI-1 indicates that there is nearly equal contribution of
2-electron and 4-electron reductions of O2 to H2O2 and H2O, respectively.

On the basis
of the experimental data shown above, the general
PDI-1-catalyzed two-electron-transfer oxygen reduction reaction can
be described as an electrochemical-chemical-electrochemical-chemical
(ECEC) type mechanism shown in Scheme 3.51 The initial electron
transfer step generates [PDI-1]•–, which
complexes with diffused O2 to form transient single-electron
reduced complex [PDI-1]/O2•–.
That is readily protonated to generate hydroperoxyl radical intermediate,
[PDI-1]/•OOH. •OOH is a stronger
oxidant, therefore formation of [PDI-1]/•OOH is
followed by the faster second ET-step to form [PDI-1]/–OOH, where the second proton transfer step leads to H2O2 as a final product with reformation of [PDI-1].

Scheme 3 Oxygen Reduction Reaction Mechanism by PDI-1 to form H2O2
As in most electrochemical
reactions, according to the mechanistic
pathway shown in Scheme 3 and the formation of H2O2 as a product during
the ORR process, proton transfer steps from reaction intermediate
[PDI-1]•–/O2 to [PDI-1]•–/•OOH are much faster than the heterogeneous electron
transfer steps.51 Furthermore, the two
single-electron transfer steps are the rate-determining steps of the
ORR process. Finally, in this work we were able to show that under
the electrochemical conditions, PDIs can serve as efficient electron
shuttles to reduce O2 to O2•– and H2O2.

Conclusion
In
summary, preparation and characterization of small well-defined
conjugated molecular analogues, PEG–PDIs, as a model to elucidate
the mechanisms operative in the SOD-mimetic activity of PEG–HCCs,
was accomplished. Water-soluble perylene diimide derivatives serve
as molecular analogues of PEG–HCCs that mimic the full catalytic
cycle of SOD. PEGn-PDI was able to oxidize
O2•–, and the PEGn-PDI•– intermediate of the
catalytic cycle is thoroughly characterized and shown to react with
O2•– in the presence of protons
to form H2O2. Having the redox potential of
PEGn-PDIs located between the two half
reactions, O2•– → O2 + e– and O2•– + 2 H+ + 2 e– → H2O2 (−0.16
and +0.94 V, respectively, relative to NHE in water), makes them good
molecular SOD-mimetics of PEG–HCCs. The freeze quench EPR study
substantiated its multiple turnover of O2•– in aqueous environment. We show that study of graphene-based catalysts
can benefit from the study precise molecular analogues,52,53 and PDI serves as a minimal model of HCCs and more generally oxidized
graphenes. Furthermore, on the basis of the results from the RDEV
and RRDEV, PDI was shown to be a metal-free molecular electrocatalyst
for the O2 reduction reaction with H2O2 being produced in 40% yield. Thus, the results indicate that similar
to carbon nanomaterials, PDI is an efficient electron shuttle for
reactions with O2 as well as ROS. These results have important
implications in the area of graphene-based materials used in electrocatalytic
processes and their potential application in nanoantioxidants.

Experimental Methods
Materials and Methods
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification unless otherwise
stated. Optical spectra were acquired on a Shimadzu 50 Scan UV/vis
spectrometer (200–1100 nm) and Cary5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (200–3000 nm), using capped quartz cuvettes.
NMR data were recorded on Bruker 400–600 MHz spectrometers.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Analysis
Crystal data,
details of data collection and structure refinement parameters for
the [PEG3–PDI•– CoCp+] are presented in Table S1 and Figure S12. Diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku SCX-Mini diffractometer
(Mercury2 CCD) using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). Integration was performed with CrystalClear-SM
Expert 2.0, and the data were corrected for absorption using empirical
methods. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined
by the full-matrix least-squares technique against F2 with the anisotropic temperature parameters for all
non-hydrogen atoms. All H atoms were geometrically placed and refined in a rigid model approximation.
Data reduction and structure refinement calculations were performed
using the SHELXTL54 program package. The
description of the disorder refinement of PEG4 groups in
the PEG3–PDI•– radical
anion is presented in the Supporting Information.

Electrochemistry
The CVs were obtained with a CHI1202
ElectroChemical Analyzer (CHIinstruments) for 10 mL electrolyte solutions
(0.1 M [(n-Bu)4N]ClO4 solution
in DMSO or PBS buffer, pH 7.4) using a 3-electrode cell. A GC electrode
served as working electrode, platinum wires served as a counter electrode
and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A platinum wire was used as
the pseudoreference electrode in DMSO and ferrocene (Fc) was used
as internal potential standard and all potentials are referred to
the Fc/Fc+ couple. CVs were recorded at a scan rate of
100 mV s–1.

RDE and RRDE experiments were
conducted in an electrochemical cell (AUTO LAB PGSTST 302) using a
Pine Instrument rotator (model: AFMSRCE) connected to a CH Instruments
electrochemical analyzer (model 600D), with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode
and a Pt wire counter electrode. A PDI-1 solution ink was prepared
by dispersing 4 mg of the PDI-1 into 1 mL of 4:1 DCM/EtOH solvent,
and 8 μL of the catalyst solution ink was loaded onto a GC electrode
(5 mm in diameter). A constant bubbling by a stream of O2 in the cell solution was maintained throughout the measurement to
ensure continuous O2 saturation. Measurements were carried
out at pH 7 (0.1 M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer). For RRDE experiments, the electrode rotation speed
was 1600 rpm (scan rate, 0.05 V/s; platinum data collected from anodic
sweeps), while the ring electrode potential was held at 1.1 V vs a
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

The O2 reduction
current increases with increasing rotation
rates following the K–L eq 8: 8  where JK is the
potential dependent kinetic current and JL is the Levich current. JL is expressed
as 0.62nF[O2](DO2)2/3ω1/2ν –1/6, where n is the number of electrons transferred
to the substrate, F is the Faraday constant, [O2] is the concentration of O2 in an air-saturated
buffer (0.22 mM in case of pH 7) at 25 °C, DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.8
× 10–5 cm2 s–1 at pH 7) at 25 °C, ω is the angular velocity of the disc
and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the solution (0.009 cm2 s–1) at 25 °C. Eq 8 can be restated as eq 9; solving for JL gives eq 10: 9   10  RRDE measurements were carried out to determine
the H2O2 yield (%) and n, which
were calculated by eqs 11 and 12: 11   12  where id and ir are the
disk and ring currents, respectively. N is the ring
current collection efficiency, which was determined to be 25% by the
reduction of 10 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in 0.1 M KNO3.

Detection of Radicals by EPR Spectroscopy
The EPR spectra
of PEG–PDI•– (0.05 mg/mL in DMSO)
in a sealed capillary tube at ambient temperature were recorded using
the following parameters: center field 3320 G, sweep width 50 G, microwave
frequency 9.3 GHz, microwave power 1 mW, modulation frequency 100
kHz, and modulation amplitude 1.0G. The same sample was remeasured
after adding a small amount of KO2 (1 mg in powder form).

Steady-State Consumption of Superoxide
PEG8–PDI
(5 μM) in 50 mM NaOH were mixed in ratio 1:5 with
increasing amounts of KO2 (dissolved in DMSO/18-crown-6)
for 10 s and then frozen in ethanol/dry Ice (−72 °C) to
stop the reaction. The samples were then transfer to LN2 to preserve the remaining O2•–. EPR spectra were then recorded. To account for background dismutation
of O2•–, a sample lacking PEG8–PDI was measured and its EPR spectra subtracted from
sample spectra to obtain the amount of KO2 decay catalyzed
by the PEG8–PDI.
