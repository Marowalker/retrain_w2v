In
nature, co-assembly of polypeptides, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides
is used to create functional supramolecular structures. Here, we show
that DNA nanostructures can be used to template interactions between
peptides and to enable the quantification of multivalent interactions
that would otherwise not be observable. Our functional building blocks
are peptide–oligonucleotide conjugates comprising de
novo designed dimeric coiled-coil peptides covalently linked
to oligonucleotide tags. These conjugates are incorporated in megadalton
DNA origami nanostructures and direct nanostructure association through
peptide–peptide interactions. Free and bound nanostructures
can be counted directly from electron micrographs, allowing estimation
of the dissociation constants of the peptides linking them. Results
for a single peptide–peptide interaction are consistent with
the measured solution-phase free energy; DNA nanostructures displaying
multiple peptides allow the effects of polyvalency to be probed. This
use of DNA nanostructures as identifiers allows the binding strengths
of homo- and heterodimeric peptide combinations to be measured in
a single experiment and gives access to dissociation constants that
are too low to be quantified by conventional techniques. The work
also demonstrates that hybrid biomolecules can be programmed to achieve
spatial organization of complex synthetic biomolecular assemblies.

==== Body
Natural biological
molecules—lipids,
nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides—fold,
assemble, and co-assemble to form a stunning variety of functional
three-dimensional structures and complexes. Understanding and harnessing
these processes underpins emerging applications in synthetic biology
and biotechnology.1−3 Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to the
manipulation of biomolecular assembly. Biomolecular engineering allows
the chemistries of natural biomolecules to be altered to produce variants
of wild-type parents whose interactions are tailored to specific applications.4−6 The alternative, de novo design, is completely
bottom-up: polypeptide or nucleic acid sequences are generated from
scratch by the designer to fold and assemble in prescribed ways.2,3,7,8 This
second route has the potential to access a much larger design space
but requires clear and reliable sequence-to-structure design rules:
this is particularly challenging in the case of polypeptides. To begin
to approach the complexity of natural systems and to harness fully
the potential of de novo biomolecular assembly, we
must learn to control and combine the assembly of different biomolecular
types to generate structured, functional co-assemblies.9,10

The specificity of Watson–Crick pairing between the
four
DNA bases has enabled the fabrication of a rapidly increasing range
of DNA nanostructures, especially DNA origami nanostructures, whose
assembled shapes can be specified with high precision and reliability
through design of the oligonucleotide components.11−18 This process is facilitated by rapid access to synthetic oligonucleotides
with ever-decreasing price,19 the application
of computer-aided design,20,21 and, most recently,
the scaling up of DNA production and assembly.22 However, although well adapted to programmed nanostructure
assembly, DNA has minimal intrinsic functionality. In contrast, the
chemical diversity of the natural amino acids underpins the folding
of a wide variety of protein structures with highly evolved functions
including architecture, signaling, active and passive transport, and
catalysis. However, the relationship between the amino acid sequence
of a polypeptide and its structure and function is complex, which
makes de novo protein design extremely challenging.3,7

For certain classes of protein structure, enough is understood
to allow rational and reliable de novo design. For
example, for α-helical coiled coils, which are bundles of two
or more α-helices,23,24 established sequence-to-structure
relationships have enabled the design of homomeric dimers, trimers
and tetramers and the assembly of obligate heterodimers and trimers.25−27 More complex and elaborate architectures—for instance, antiparallel
arrangements of helices and homomeric and heteromeric assemblies above
a tetramer—have proved more challenging to design and have
been discovered serendipitously or designed computationally.7,24,27,28 One way to access more complex structures is to make use of the
high spatial resolution and predictable architectures of DNA nanostructures
to template peptide assemblies and thus force otherwise unobtainable
configurations of α-helices. Others have described the assembly
of trimeric coiled-coil DNA conjugates,29,30 layered nanostructures
formed from collagen-mimetic peptides and oligonucleotides,31 and DNA-directed peptide pores;9,10 conversely, proteins have been used to direct the folding of DNA
scaffolds.32

Here, we describe the
formation of peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugates that can be used to control the assembly of larger DNA–peptide
structures and thereby to quantify multivalent peptide–peptide
interactions. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) “handles”,
extending from two distinct DNA origami nanostructures, hybridize
to complementary oligonucleotide “tags” which are covalently
linked to peptides. This places a prescribed number of peptides, each
of which is half of a heterodimeric peptide coiled coil, on one end
of each DNA origami. Dimerization of the composite nanostructures
is driven by association of the peptides to form coiled coils (Scheme 1). Markers on the
DNA origamis allow assembled species to be distinguished by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Counting the distributions of all kinds
of assembly in electron micrographs allows the dissociation constant
(Kd) for each to be estimated and the
effect of polyvalency on peptide–peptide interactions to be
investigated.

Scheme 1 Assembly of Megadalton DNA Origami Structures Is Driven
by Peptide–Oligonucleotide
Conjugates through Formation of Peptide Coiled-Coil Heterodimers and
Pairing of Oligonucleotide Tags with Complementary ssDNA Handles
Peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugates are formed via a Cu-free cycloaddition
between the highlighted azide side chains of the peptides and the
ring-strained dibenzylcyclooctyne groups of the oligonucleotide tags.

Results and Discussion
Peptides Compatible with
Both Oligonucleotide Conjugation and
Peptide Assembly Can Be Designed De Novo
Coiled-coil peptide sequences have heptad repeats, abcdefg, with
hydrophobic residues predominating at the “a” and “d”
sites.33,34 These form amphipathic α-helices whose
assembly is driven by the formation of an a/d hydrophobic seam. Judicious
placement of specific amino acids at these positions dictates an oligomeric
state, with a = isoleucine (Ile) and d = leucine (Leu) directing dimers.24,26 The “e” and “g” sites which flank the
hydrophobic core can be used to stabilize both homo- and heteromeric
assemblies.35−37 Complementary patterns of charged residues at these
sites have been used by many groups to create de novo heterodimers.35−40

The simplest previously reported coiled-coil heterodimers
have glutamic acid (Glu) at all “e” and “g”
sites in one peptide and lysine (Lys) at these sites in the complementary
peptide.35−37,41 However, we confirmed
that the basic peptide binds nonspecifically and tightly to DNA, consistent
with strong electrostatic interactions, making it unsuitable for use
in composite peptide–DNA nanostructures. We therefore designed
a series of parallel heterodimeric coiled coils in which each peptide
was, overall, close to or exactly charge-neutral at pH 7. Peptide
sequences are given in Supporting Information (SI), Table S1. These peptides had blocks of both Glu- and
Lys-based heptads, with Asn residues at some of the central “a”
sites to add stability and increase specificity.42 They varied in length, having 3, 3.5, or 4 heptad repeats
and, in the case of the 4-heptad pairs, either one or two asparagine
residues at “a” sites to destabilize off-target homomers.
The peptides were made by solid-phase peptide synthesis, purified
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and confirmed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry
(SI Figure S1). They were characterized
in solution, both alone and in combination with their designed partners,
using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation
(AUC) (Figure 1 and SI Figures S2 and S3, Tables S2 and S3).

the individual peptides is shown in black (no symbols). The spectrum

and 60 krpm. (red). (d) Peptide sequences and optimized model of CC-Di-EK:KE
with lysine-rich heptads shown in blue, glutamic acid-rich heptads
in red, and asparagine residues at positions “a” highlighted

On the basis of CD and AUC characterization,
the CC-Di-EK and CC-Di-KE
pair (Figure 1), comprising
four complete heptad repeats with asparagines at two “a”
sites, was identified as a suitable coiled coil to link peptide–DNA
nanostructures. CD spectra showed that unmixed CC-Di-EK and CC-Di-KE
were either largely or fully unfolded at 5 °C, neutral pH, and
50 μM concentration, but that a 1:1 mixture of the peptides
was fully α-helical43 and had a sigmoidal
thermal unfolding transition with a midpoint (TM) of 43 °C (Figure 1a,b), consistent with the formation of a stable coiled-coil
heterodimer. From the concentration dependence of the TM, the Kd for heterodimerization
was estimated to be 102 ± 26 nM (SI Figure S4). Fits of AUC data assuming a single ideal species returned
the mass of the CC-Di-EK:KE dimer (Figure 1c) and confirmed that the umixed peptides
were monomers (SI Figure S3 and Table S3). Molecular models built and optimized in ISAMBARD44 indicate that these peptides form a stable coiled-coil
dimer with a strong preference for the parallel helix orientation
(Figure 1d and SI Figure S5). To confirm the preferred helix
orientation, the peptides were synthesized with terminal Cys residues
and linked as obligate heterodimers via disulfide
bonds. With the peptides linked via the same ends—that
is, both C-termini, consistent with parallel helix formation—the
resulting conjugate was highly helical, thermally stable, and monomeric
(SI Figures S2 and S3, Tables S2 and S3). In contrast, when linked via opposite ends, the
behavior of the construct was more complex with larger oligomeric
complexes indicated by AUC. These experiments support the conclusion
that the unlinked CC-Di-EK and CC-Di-KE peptides form a stable, parallel,
helical heterodimer. CD spectra showed no interaction between either
CC-Di-EK or CC-Di-KE and the ssDNA tags (SI Figure S6a,b). This confirmed our design choice to use charge-neutral
or acidic peptides for conjugation to DNA tags.

Other peptide
pairs were not developed further. CD and AUC experiments
(SI Figures S2 and S3, Tables S2 and S3) showed that the 4-heptad peptides with only a single asparagine
displayed off-target homomeric interactions and that the 3-heptad
pair was not fully folded. The 3.5-heptad pair CC-Di-EN3.5 was rejected
because it had a +1 net charge.

Peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugates were synthesized as follows.
Azidonorleucine (Z) was added during peptide synthesis at the C-terminus
of CC-Di-EK and at the N-terminus of CC-Di-KE to give CC-Di-EK-Z and
Z-CC-Di-KE (SI Table S1). These were then
conjugated to dibenzylcyclooctyne-functionalized oligonucleotide tags,
α and β, respectively, by copper-free 1–3 Huisgen
cycloaddition (Scheme 1 and SI Figure S6).45 The resulting conjugates, CC-Di-EK-α and β-CC-Di-KE,
were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and confirmed by LC-MS (SI Figures S6 and S7). Flexible single-stranded
spacers (eight thymidines) were included in the oligonucleotide tags
to separate the peptide attachment site and the duplex formed between
tag and complementary handle (SI Figure S10 and Table S6). The CD spectra of the peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugates when mixed were consistent with the formation of a fully
folded α-helical species and had a thermal unfolding profile
(TM = 34 °C) similar to that of the
untagged peptides (SI Figure S8: the predicted TM for unconjugated peptides at this concentration
is 36 °C).

Two Distinct DNA Nanostructures Whose Identities
and Orientation
Can Be Determined by Electron Microscopy
Two readily distinguishable,
asymmetric DNA origami nanostructures, A and B, were designed with
the assistance of caDNAno software20,21,46 (Figure 2a,b47 and SI Figure S9). Each had a central six-helix bundle with either
one or two asymmetrically placed sleeves (bulges comprising a concentric
layer of DNA helices) wrapped around it. The nanostructures were assembled
by annealing a 2686 nucleotide single-stranded scaffold, derived from
pUC19 plasmid,48 with 69 and 67 synthetic
oligonucleotide staples, respectively (SI Table S6). The asymmetric positions of the sleeves allowed rapid
determination of the identity and orientation of individual origamis
in electron micrographs (Figure 2c,d). Each origami was functionalized at the end further
from the sleeves with three single-stranded 23 nucleotide handles
as extensions to selected staples (Figure 2a,b). Extensions were either complementary
to the oligonucleotide tags α and β, referred to as A
and B handles, respectively, or noncomplementary dummy sequences (SI Figure S10 and Table S6).

is a 6-helix bundle (each double helix is represented by a gray cylinder).
Staple extensions provide three single-stranded handle sequences at
one end of the six-helix bundle (top left insets). The valency can
be controlled by replacing one or more handles with a dummy sequence
unrelated to that of the peptide-functionalized oligonucleotide tags.

Peptide–Oligonucleotide Conjugates
Bring Together DNA
Nanostructures
Each DNA origami was decorated with one, two,
or three copies of the corresponding half of the heterodimeric coiled-coil
peptide pair, that is, A with CC-Di-EK-α and B with β-CC-Di-KE.
Preassembled origamis displaying the specified number of complementary
ssDNA handles were incubated at room temperature (approximately 20
°C) with a 3× stoichiometric excess of the corresponding
oligonucleotide-tagged peptide. The resulting peptide-decorated origamis,
named An and Bn, where n (n = 1, 2, 3) indicates
the number of peptides attached to each DNA origami, were purified
by gel electrophoresis (Figure 3a and SI Figure S11). Subsequent
mixing of purified An and Bn resulted in the formation of heterodimeric complexes
An:Bn, which,
when imaged by TEM, were seen to be joined almost exclusively via their peptide-labeled ends (Figure 3b–d and SI Figure S12), consistent with dimerization driven by the formation
of peptide coiled coils as designed.

peptide–oligonucleotide conjugates. (a) DNA origamis A3 and B3 decorated with three peptides. (b–e)
Representative TEM images of the assembly of peptide-decorated DNA
origamis. The distribution between species depends on the number of
peptides, n, displayed on each origami: (b) n = 3, (c) n = 2, (d) n = 1, and (e) n = 0. White numbers in (b) indicate
representative heterodimers (1 and 2) and monomers (3 and 4). The
initial concentrations of assemblies An and Bn were, respectively, 0.61 and
0.84 nM (b, n = 3), 0.84 and 1.09 nM (c, n = 2), 1.69 and 2.39 nM (d, n = 1), and
0.68 and 0.74 nM (e, n = 0). Scale bars: 50 nm. (f)
Dissociation constants of heterodimers of origamis functionalized
with different numbers of peptides were determined from linear fits
(solid lines) to plots of [An] ×
[Bn] as a function of [An:Bn] over a range of total monomer
concentrations from 0.25 to 2.4 nM. Data were weighted by estimated
uncertainties (SI Tables S4, S5 and supporting discussion).

The use of two DNA origami
structures that can be distinguished
in electron micrographs allowed us to identify manually and count
free assemblies An, Bn, and all complexes formed between them, that is, the intended
heterodimer An:Bn, homodimers (An:An and Bn:Bn), and any larger multimers (Figure 3b–e and SI Figure S12 and Table S4). If it is assumed that the distribution between
complexes on the TEM grid is representative of that present in solution,
then, given the initial total concentrations of the two peptide-decorated
DNA origamis, the equilibrium concentration of each species can be
inferred. In each experiment, approximately 1000 origamis of each
type were counted and classified as monomeric, homo- or heterodimeric,
or as part of a larger multimer. Uncertainties in inferring equilibrium
concentrations of these species from the observed distributions of
particles in electron micrographs are discussed in the SI supporting discussion and quantified in SI Table S5.

As anticipated, in the absence
of attached peptides (n = 0), very few complexes
were counted (Figure 3e and SI Figure S12-1 and Table S4-1). This background count is likely to be due
to chance observations of two origami structures in close proximity
rather than to any interaction between the origamis: the data are
consistent with a random distribution of origami nanostructures in
each micrograph with a minimum detectable separation between the ends
of adjacent origamis of 8 nm (SI supporting discussion). This minimum radius was used to calculate a background due to
random coincidences which was subtracted from the observed numbers
of dimers between nanostructures functionalized with one, two, or
three peptides (SI Tables S4-2, S4-3, and S4-4).

For mono- and bifunctionalized origamis (n = 1,
2), the numbers of dimers observed were small, typically <2 and
<4%, respectively, of the number of monomers counted, but for trifunctionalized
origamis, the population of heterodimers reached 40% of the total
number of particles. It was possible to obtain consistent estimates
of the dissociation constants for all heterodimers and for n = 3 homodimers. Kd values
were estimated from the fitted slopes of plots of [An] × [Bn] vs [An:Bn],
[An]2vs [An:An], and [Bn]2vs [Bn:Bn] for a range
of initial monomer concentrations (0.25–2.4 nM) (Figure 3f and SI Figure S13). Results are presented in Table 1.

a See SI supporting discussion of experimental errors: there is an additional systematic
error of approximately 20% in all Kd values
corresponding to uncertainty in determining DNA origami concentrations.

Our estimated Kd of 130 ± 20 nM
for the monofunctionalized heterodimer A1:B1 is close to the value of 102 ± 26 nM determined from the melting
temperatures of free peptides in solution (SI Figure S4). This is consistent with our design hypothesis that
interactions between peptide-functionalized origamis are dominated
by specific peptide–peptide interactions and suggests that
the preparation of samples for electron microscopy does not introduce
significant sampling bias (SI supporting discussion). Increasing the number of displayed peptides increases the interaction
strength, decreasing the dissociation constant by approximately 200×
for the trifunctionalized heterodimer. Association between trifunctionalized
homodimers A3:A3 and B3:B3 is clearly resolved and is 30× weaker than for the corresponding
heterodimer, consistent with the designed association bias of the
peptides.

Upon increasing the number of attached peptides from n = 1 to n = 2, the heterodimer Kd decreases only by a factor of approximately
5, which
is orders of magnitude less than the factor that would be expected
if two parallel peptide links could be formed independently.49,50 As shown in SI Figures S9 and S10, the
ends of the origamis are not flat (the ends of the six bundled DNA
helices are not aligned). Despite the presence of flexible T8 linkers between each peptide and the DNA duplex linking it to the
origami, this may hinder the simultaneous formation of multiple coiled-coil
links between pairs of origamis, providing a natural explanation for
the unexpectedly small increase in affinity observed. The observed
increase in affinity can be almost entirely attributed to the 4-fold
increase in the number of ways of making a single coiled coil from
two pairs of peptides, consistent with the hypothesis that a single
peptide–peptide link dominates interactions between doubly
functionalized origamis. If this combinatorial argument were extended
to the n = 3 system, we would predict Kd ≈ 10 nM, as there are nine ways to make a single
coiled-coil link between origamis displaying three peptides each.
However, we observed an order of magnitude greater enhancement. This
strongly suggests polyvalent binding:49,50 there is a
significant probability that at least two of the three possible coiled-coil
links are formed simultaneously.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have shown that DNA origami nanostructures can be
used to template and quantify the assembly of de novo designed peptides. To avoid nonspecific binding of the peptides
to DNA, it was necessary to design charge-neutral, heterodimeric coiled-coil
peptides which will prove useful in biomolecular construction and
synthetic biology more generally. The use of distinguishable DNA origami
conjugates allows the use of electron microscopy to estimate otherwise
undetectable concentrations of free and bound peptides. The direct
enumeration of interacting species provides an alternative way to
determine Kd, which can be applied at
concentrations much lower than would be practical for traditional
methods such as CD spectroscopy or isothermal calorimetry. It also
allows simultaneous measurement of dissociation constants for all
observed species in a reaction mixture, in this case, homomeric and
heteromeric complexes, something that would be impossible to deduce
by measurement of a single average quantity such as circular dichroism.
This semiquantitative technique also allows us to probe the effects
of polyvalent interactions: the enhanced binding of trifunctionalized
origami heterodimers indicates that the use of a DNA origami template
to preposition multiple peptides is an effective method to control
their interactions. This study shows the way to the development of
more sophisticated DNA templates to control of the spatial orientation
of peptide and protein assemblies and to the use of peptide–peptide
interactions to direct DNA assembly.

Experimental
Section
Peptide Synthesis
Peptides were synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis on a rink amide resin
(Novabiochem, 0.1 mmol scale) using a microwave-assisted CEM Liberty
Blue synthesizer (CEM Corporation) and standard deprotection and coupling
chemistries. Peptide-grade dimethylformamide (DMF) was used throughout.
Fmoc deprotections were performed with 20% morpholine in DMF (Merck-Millipore),
followed by Cl-HOBt (AGTC Bioproducts, 0.5 M in DMF) and DIC (AGTC
Bioproducts, 1 M in DMF) activated couplings of each amino acid (AGTC
Bioproducts). N-Terminal acetylations were performed with pyridine
(Fisher Scientific, 0.5 mL) and acetic anyhydride (BDH Laboratories,
0.25 mL) in DMF (15 min). Peptides were cleaved from the resin in
trifluoroacetic acid (Acros Organics) with a triisopropylsilane scavenger
(Sigma-Aldrich) and H2O at 90:5:5 vol % under agitation
for 2 h. The cleavage mixtures were then filtered to remove the resin,
and the volume was reduced to <5 mL by a flow of nitrogen before
precipitation of the crude peptides by addition of cold diethyl ether.
A solid peptide pellet was obtained by centrifugation followed by
removal of the supernatant. This was then lyophilized from 1:1 H2O/MeCN to yield crude peptides as white powders.

DNA Origami
Design
DNA origamis A and B were designed
using caDNAno.3 Nicks separating staple
strands were positioned manually, as shown in SI Figure S9. As shown in SI Figure S10, staple strands on helices 0, 2, and 4, at the end further from
the marker bulges of each origami, were extended with 23 nucleotide
handles to hybridize with corresponding peptide–oligonucleotide
tags α or β. Some or all of these handles were substituted
with dummy handles, 23 nucleotide extensions that are noncomplementary
to the peptide–oligonucleotide conjugates, when origamis functionalized
with 2, 1, or 0 peptides were produced.

A T8 spacer
was included at the 5′ ends of the DNA tags to separate the
peptides from the 23 nucleotide binding sequences complementary to
the handles. Polythymidine extensions (in most cases T4) were added to staple strands at the ends of each origami, except
at the handle positions, to minimize nonspecific helix-stacking interactions
between origamis.

Equilibrium Concentration Calculations
The numbers
(N) of monomers (An,
Bn) and of dimers (An:Bn, An:An, Bn:Bn) and higher multimers, in which the proximity
of the peptide-functionalized ends was consistent with the formation
of a peptide-bound complex, were counted. A background corresponding
to the random chance of observing two origami structures in close
proximity (i.e., when their peptide-functionalized
ends are within 8 nm of each other; see main text) was subtracted.
The equilibrium concentration of each species was assumed to be proportional
to the number counted and was estimated from counted numbers of each
assembled complex and the total monomer concentrations (summed over
all assemblies) (SI Table S4).

Kd Calculation and Fitting Model
Linear fits to
graphs of [An] ×
[Bn] vs [An:Bn], [An]2vs [An:An], and [Bn]2vs [Bn:Bn] for six different
initial concentrations [Bn]0 ≈ [An]0 from 0.25
to 2.4 nM were obtained using OriginPro (Figure 3f and SI Figure S13). Data were weighted by estimated uncertainties in both quantities
(SI supporting discussion and Table S5).
The dissociation constant was estimated as the gradient of a linear
fit to these data which was constrained to pass through the origin,
(0,0).
