The
epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a distinct
product of active DNA demethylation that is linked to gene regulation,
development, and disease. In particular, 5-hmC levels dramatically
decline in many cancers, potentially serving as an epigenetic biomarker.
The noise associated with next-generation 5-hmC sequencing hinders
reliable analysis of low 5-hmC containing tissues such as blood and
malignant tumors. Additionally, genome-wide 5-hmC profiles generated
by short-read sequencing are limited in providing long-range epigenetic
information relevant to highly variable genomic regions, such as the
3.7 Mbp disease-related Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region. We present
a long-read, highly sensitive single-molecule mapping technology that
generates hybrid genetic/epigenetic profiles of native chromosomal
DNA. The genome-wide distribution of 5-hmC in human peripheral blood
cells correlates well with 5-hmC DNA immunoprecipitation (hMeDIP)
sequencing. However, the long single-molecule read-length of 100 kbp
to 1 Mbp produces 5-hmC profiles across variable genomic regions that
failed to show up in the sequencing data. In addition, optical 5-hmC
mapping shows a strong correlation between the 5-hmC density in gene
bodies and the corresponding level of gene expression. The single-molecule
concept provides information on the distribution and coexistence of
5-hmC signals at multiple genomic loci on the same genomic DNA molecule,
revealing long-range correlations and cell-to-cell epigenetic variation.

==== Body
The characterization
and profiling
of new DNA epigenetic modifications has been the focus of many studies
in recent years. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), the first in a chain
of chemical oxidation products catalyzed by the Ten-11 translocation
(TET) family of dioxygenases during active DNA demethylation, has
garnered special attention since its discovery in mammalian cells
in 2009.1,2 5-hmC was first thought to be a transient
state; however, increasing evidence suggests that this modification
plays a role in the regulation of gene expression, affecting development
and cell differentiation.3−7 Although its mechanism of action is not fully resolved, it is considered
a key player in several processes, including binding of transcription
factors and regulators, altering chromatin structure, and modulating
alternative splicing, presumably by influencing the recruitment and
binding of associated proteins.8−12 Several studies have linked 5-hmC with neurological disorders, stress
response, and aging.13−16 Additionally, depletion in global 5-hmC levels has been observed
in various pathological conditions, including several types of cancer.17−24 Furthermore, recent reports showed characteristic 5-hmC profiles
in the cell-free circulating DNA of cancer patients.25−27 Such profiles may provide information regarding tumor type and stage,
making 5-hmC a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and response
to therapy. The increasing interest in 5-hmC has served as a catalyst
for the development of several techniques for profiling its distribution
on a genome-wide scale. Currently accepted methods include single-base
resolution methods such as oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq)28 and TET-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-seq),29 as well as lower resolution affinity-based enrichment
methods such as 5-hmC DNA immunoprecipitation (hMeDIP),4,30 5-hmC selective chemical labeling (hMe-Seal),31 and nano-hmC-Seal.32 The main
limitation of all of these techniques is their reliance on sequencing
by synthesis (SBS), also frequently termed next generation sequencing
(NGS), which requires pooling and fragmentation of genomic DNA. As
such, the epigenetic profile reported by these techniques is the average
distribution of an entire population of cells, where cell-to-cell
variation is lost, and with it the ability to detect small subpopulations.
Recently reported single-cell 5-hmC sequencing may potentially capture
5-hmC variation,33 but its low genomic
sampling rate and reliance on NGS lead to difficulties in the analysis
of long-range correlations at a reasonable cost.34 Third generation sequencing approaches, including single-molecule,
real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Pacific Biosciences), and nanopore sequencing
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies) have demonstrated the potential ability
to detect chemical modifications directly on single, long DNA molecules.35−39 However, extensive development of these applications is still necessary
before they are used for whole-genome epigenetic profiling. A significant
challenge arises when profiling tissues that exhibit ultralow levels
of 5-hmC, such as human blood (0.001–0.005%). In such experiments,
the real 5-hmC signal drops to the inherent noise level of the above-mentioned
techniques. For affinity approaches, a relatively constant rate of
false positives is dictated by nonspecific capture of DNA, and for
oxBS-seq and TAB-seq, nonideal chemical conversion results in false
readout. Specifically, gold-standard TAB-seq relies on enzymatic conversion
that at best reaches 99% efficiency. In the case of blood, the result
is an equivalent number of true and false 5-hmC signals, undermining
the ability to extract informative data.

Here we present optical
5-hmC mapping, a single-molecule mapping
approach for studying the genomic distribution of 5-hmC. We apply
our method to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), emphasizing
the high sensitivity of this single-molecule approach. Our method
integrates into genome mapping technology, commercialized by BioNano
Genomics Inc., which relies on extending fluorescently labeled DNA
molecules in nanochannel arrays.40,41 Fluorescence
microscopy allows simultaneous detection of genetic and epigenetic
information on the same molecule, by labeling each feature with a
different color. By using color as a contrast mechanism, this method
can be extended further to detect several epigenetic observables simultaneously,
allowing the study of modification coexistence.42,43 In this study, genetic and epigenetic marks on individual DNA molecules
are labeled simultaneously in two different colors. The genetic barcode
is generated by enzymatically labeling DNA in a specific sequence
motif, and an additional epigenetic information layer is produced
by labeling 5-hmC through a specific chemo-enzymatic reaction.44 By aligning the genetic labels to a reference,
the genomic positions of 5-hmC labels are mapped to obtain a genome-wide
profile of epigenetic modifications (Figure 1).

5, highlighting large structural variations such as the 7 kbp deletion
in the midright part of the molecule, denoted by the diagonal alignment
marks. 5-hmC labels (red) are mapped on the basis of genetic alignment.

We compare the 5-hmC patterns
detected by our optical mapping approach
in PBMCs to hMeDIP-seq results generated for the same sample. We show
that optical mapping displays higher sensitivity and lower background
noise and that global patterns correlate well with previously reported
results regarding the distribution of 5-hmC near regulatory elements
and its enrichment in highly expressed genes. Furthermore, we show
the correlation between 5-hmC density in gene bodies and their corresponding
expression levels over a large dynamic range. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential strength of long-read optical mapping in characterizing
epigenetic patterns in variable genomic regions, which currently pose
a challenge for NGS technology.

Results and Discussion
We developed optical 5-hmC mapping on high-molecular-weight DNA
extracted from fresh human PBMCs. A nick-translation reaction with
the nicking enzyme Nt.BspQI was performed in order to incorporate
a green fluorophore into the DNA, producing a sequence specific labeling
pattern for genome mapping. A second layer of information was obtained
by performing a chemo-enzymatic reaction to specifically label 5-hmC
with a red fluorophore. This simultaneous labeling scheme enables
the positioning of 5-hmC sites according to the genetic labels, yielding
single-molecule whole-genome 5-hmC maps.

Efficiency of 5-hmC Labeling
Efficient labeling of
5-hmC is critical for obtaining meaningful information from individual
molecules. In order to evaluate the efficiency of 5-hmC labeling,
we performed two separate nick-labeling reactions on purified lambda
phage DNA. The reactions contained either fluorescent nucleotides,
for assessment of nick-labeling efficiency, or 5-hmC nucleotides,
which were then fluorescently labeled according to our 5-hmC labeling
scheme and used for assessment of 5-hmC labeling efficiency. DNA from
both reactions was combined, driven into nanochannels, and imaged
together on an Irys instrument (Figure 2A). The lambda phage genome contains 10 expected Nt.BspQI
nicking sites, with two sites that cannot be separated due to the
optical resolution limit. Labeling efficiency was calculated by comparing
the number of detected spots to the number of expected nicking sites.

Figure 2 Assessment
of 5-hmC labeling efficiency. Lambda DNA was nicked
with Nt.BspQI (nine expected labeling spots) and labeled with either
5-hmC or fluorescent dUTP. 5-hmC was labeled according to our labeling
scheme, and the samples were mixed and imaged together in order to
evaluate the labeling efficiency. (A) Representative field of view
showing a mixed population of green (nicking) and red (5-hmC) labeled
molecules. (B) Histograms showing the number of labels per molecule
for 5-hmC labeling (top) and nicking (bottom).

Figure 2B
shows
the number of detected labels per molecule in the red channel (5-hmC
labeling) and in the green channel (nick-labeling). Nick-labeling
efficiency was calculated by dividing the average number of green
labels per molecule in each scan by the total number of expected labels.
5-hmC labeling efficiency was calculated by dividing the average number
of red labels per molecule by the average number of green labels per
molecule in each scan. A total of 20,520 scanned images were analyzed
to determine labeling efficiency. Accordingly, the nicking efficiency
was determined as 85 ± 2%, and the 5-hmC labeling efficiency
as 82 ± 3%.

Quantification of 5-hmC Sites per Detected
Label by Measuring
Photobleaching Steps
Due to the diffraction limit, multiple
5-hmC sites on the same 1 kb region will result in multiple close-by
fluorescent labels that generate a single fluorescent spot. The number
of fluorophores detected in each isolated 5-hmC spot has a crucial
role in determining the actual density of 5-hmC. It was therefore
important that we validate the characteristic amount of fluorophores,
and therefore the number of 5-hmC sites, per isolated fluorescent
spot. In order to assess the number of fluorophores, we monitored
the photobleaching process which fluorophores undergo when exposed
to intense laser excitation (see Methods).
Quantifying the amount of photobleaching steps enabled us to accurately
determine the number of 5-hmC sites per detected spot (Figures S1–S3). Approximately 1000 fluorescent
spots along the DNA were analyzed in order to construct the distribution
of 5-hmC clusters. The full distribution allowed us to correct for
this effect as part of the calibration procedure. Effectively, 1.45
fluorophores are present in each fluorescent spot and this correction
factor was taken into account for global quantification. Since over
90% of the analyzed 5-hmC spots contained  one to two 5-hmC
labels, our method can reliably quantify 5-hmC in genomic DNA from
blood, without considering the fluorescence intensity of the spots.
Using such global quantification, we have recently shown that our
labeling scheme can detect a decrease in the global level of 5-hmC
in blood and colon tumor cells vs normal cells.21

Generation of Genome-Wide 5-hmC Profiles
To recover
the genome-wide distribution of 5-hmC, we combined our labeling scheme
with conventional genome mapping by generating a sequence specific
fluorescent barcode in addition to the epigenetic marks. This dual-color
labeling provides information on the amount as well as the location
and distribution of 5-hmC sites along the genome.

Labeled DNA
was stretched and imaged on nanochannel array chips, and the positions
of genetic and epigenetic labels were automatically detected. Molecule
images and genome browser compatible molecule tracks were generated
with Irys Extract45 (Figure 1A,C). A total of 992,030 long molecules (>150
kb) were aligned to the reference (human hg19), and 587,583 that passed
our confidence criteria (see Methods) were
used for downstream analysis, generating a median genomic coverage
of 46X. In order to verify the 5-hmC density obtained from optical
mapping, we performed LC-MS/MS measurements on DNA extracted from
the same PBMCs sample (see Supporting Information, Figure S4). The percentage of 5-hmC in DNA extracted from PBMCs
was calculated as 0.0035%. This is in agreement with the mean 5-hmC
density measured for the optical mapping experiment (0.0029%).

In order to validate our optical mapping results, we also performed
two independent hMeDIP-seq experiments on the same sample. On the
basis of the correlation between the genomic 5-hmC profiles of these
two experiments (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.7), we were able
to merge the sequencing reads from both data sets, in order to enhance
the 5-hmC signal. The extremely low levels of 5-hmC in blood,46 together with nonspecific pulldown inherent
in this type of experiments,47,48 resulted in low signal-to-noise
ratio for the sequencing data. Thus, a minimal threshold for 5-hmC
reads was set for downstream analysis (Supporting Information, Figures S5 and S6). We note that it is likely
that using more sensitive enrichment techniques for sequencing may
have resulted in better sequencing signal and coverage, with overall
better correlation with our optical mapping results. However, at the
time of experiments, hMeDIP-Seq was a more established benchmark for
comparison.

Global Optical Mapping Patterns of 5-hmC
Correlate with Sequencing
Results
We first wanted to verify that the epigenetic patterns
we observe using our optical mapping approach correlate with the patterns
observed in the sequencing results. To this end, we examined the global
distribution of 5-hmC in both data sets near several regulatory elements
(Figure 3A–C).
Both methods display distinct patterns near transcription start sites
(TSS), enhancers marked by the histone modification H3K4me1, and active
enhancers marked by the histone modification H3K27Ac, as previously
reported for embryonic stem cells (ESCs), brain, and blood.49−51 In all cases, the patterns detected by both methods are highly correlated.
However, global examination of both data sets on a genome-wide scale
(Figure 3) establishes
the advantages of the optical mapping approach. While the sequencing
results show finer features due to the higher resolution of hMeDIP
(∼200 bp) compared to optical mapping (∼1500 bp), the
optical data displays superior signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us
to reliably detect low levels of 5-hmC. This high sensitivity is likely
due to the low false positive and false negative rates of our labeling
scheme (Figure 1).
Moreover, while antibody-based methods are biased toward heavily modified
regions,48 the high sensitivity of optical
detection, combined with the single-molecule aspect of this approach,
allows the detection of rare, isolated 5-hmC residues occurring only
in a small subset of cells. This is clearly seen in the additional
signals present in the optical mapping track in Figure 3D.

peaks. (C) Coverage as a function of distance from H3K27Ac histone
modification peaks. (D) Comparison of coverage produced by both methods
in a representative 500 kbp region from chromosome 1. hMeDIP-seq results
are presented in 1 kbp resolution.

5-hmC Levels in Gene Bodies Correlate with Gene Expression
Following reports regarding 5-hmC enrichment in the bodies of highly
expressed genes,49−51 we examined the correlation between gene expression
and 5-hmC levels for both optical mapping and hMeDIP-seq results (Figure 4). Although for both
methods higher levels of 5-hmC are observed in highly expressed genes,
optical 5-hmC mapping presents a much larger dynamic range. The high
sensitivity and specificity of the fluorescent labeling utilized in
optical 5-hmC mapping enable a clear distinction between the 5-hmC
levels in gene bodies of low expressed and unexpressed genes. These
two groups are almost indistinguishable in the hMeDIP-seq results.
These results suggest that 5-hmC levels may be used to infer gene
expression without directly quantifying RNA levels.

Optical Mapping “Long Reads” Allow the Characterization
of Highly Variable Regions
The relatively low resolution
of optical-based detection is undoubtedly the main drawback of this
approach. Nevertheless, one of the main advantages of genetic optical
mapping is the ability to use long-range information encoded in long
DNA molecules to characterize highly variable genomic regions.52,53 These “long reads” extend beyond the variable region
and may be anchored to the reference based on reliable alignment to
conserved flanking regions, maintaining contiguity along the variable
region itself.

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region, located
on chromosome arm 6p21.3, is one of the most polymorphic regions in
the human genome.54 This 3.6 Mb region
has been associated with more than 100 diseases, including diabetes,
psoriasis, and asthma, and several alleles of HLA genes have been
linked to hypersensitivity to specific drugs.55,56 Therefore, information regarding the epigenetic landscape of this
region may have clinical importance.

Examining the region around
the HLA-A gene, one of three major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I cell surface receptors, we
found that single molecules can indeed be aligned to the reference
with high confidence around this locus. This resulted in the detection
of high levels of 5-hmC in this region, information that was not detected
by hMeDIP-seq, as there were no sequencing reads aligned to this gene
(Figure 5A). The highly
variable nature of this locus is known to pose a challenge to NGS
sequencing technologies. In contrast, the alignment of long optical
reads to the reference is not hampered by the variable region, since
it occupies only a small portion of the detected molecule. Consequently,
using optical 5-hmC mapping, we are able to directly detect 5-hmC
modifications in the HLA region without the amplification or specific
targeting methods currently needed for short-read-based experiments.57,58

the histone gene cluster. (C) 5-hmC coverage of 103 kbp around TLR7
and TLR8-AS1. (D) 5-hmC coverage of 98 kbp containing the TLR cluster
located on chromosome 4.

Similarly, our optical mapping results could profile the
epigenetic
patterns of other variable regions that were not well represented
in the sequencing results. For example, we were able to detect the
5-hmC distribution in the histone gene cluster located on chromosome
arm 1q21, which harbors variant genes as well as duplicated regions
(Figure 5B).59−61 The sequencing signal was very low in this ∼100 kbp cluster,
with no detected signals in histone gene bodies. Correlation between
methylation in histone genes and disease has been previously reported,62,63 but a thorough investigation is required to establish the importance
of 5-hmC density in these genes. The advantages of optical mapping
in variable regions are further exemplified by the highly polymorphic
toll-like receptor (TLR) gene clusters located on chromosome arms
4p14 and Xp22.2.64 TLR genes presented
modest 5-hmC density in the optical map, presumably since only a small
subset of PBMCs express these genes. In the sequencing results, the
sparse 5-hmC content is practically undetected (Figure 5C and D).

In recent years, genetic
optical mapping has proven to be invaluable
for the characterization of variable and repetitive regions inaccessible
to NGS technologies, as well as for completing assemblies of various
species.65,66 In this work, we demonstrate the ability
to add a second, epigenetic layer of information to long individual
DNA molecules. The combination of existing optical genome mapping
technology with a 5-hmC-specific labeling reaction creates a genome-wide
profile of this epigenetic mark in human PBMCs.

We demonstrate
that optical 5-hmC mapping produces an epigenetic
map that correlates well with the epigenetic map produced by hMeDIP-seq,
which relies on gold-standard NGS technologies. Despite the resolution
limit of optical detection, optical 5-hmC mapping proves to be superior
to hMeDIP-seq in sensitivity and specificity, resulting in a high
signal-to-noise ratio and broad dynamic range. The recently presented
nano-hmC-Seal32 capture approach provides
highly sensitive genome wide profiling of 5-hmC using as low as ∼1000
cells. Although still limited by the short-read nature of NGS, this
approach holds promise for accurate 5-hmC profiling where very small
amounts of DNA are available. TAB-seq, another gold standard technique
for genome-wide 5-hmC profiling, can detect the epigenetic mark with
high resolution and high efficiency.29 Nevertheless,
it is limited to tissues expressing relatively high levels of 5-hmC.
This is due to the conversion rate of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-carboxycytosine
(5-CaC) by the TET enzyme. Even in the case of 99% conversion efficiency,
1% of nonconverted methylated C will be detected as 5-hmC. This false
positive rate of TAB-seq is on the same order as the real 5-hmC content
in tissues exhibiting extremely low levels of 5-hmC such as blood.
With an average signal-to-noise ratio of 1, TAB-seq is limited in
its ability to characterize the distribution of 5-hmC in PBMCs.

Our labeling and imaging technique highlights single 5-hmC sites
with no false positives and a minor false negative rate. These attributes
enable the detection of extremely low levels of epigenetic modifications.
This is especially important for cancer related studies, where 5-hmC
levels decline drastically with disease progression.17 Additionally, utilizing the long-range information encoded
in optical “long reads” enables the epigenetic characterization
of variable and repetitive regions known to pose a challenge to NGS
technologies.

Conclusions
We present a method
for whole-genome, single-molecule, epigenetic
mapping of 5-hmC. The method offers extremely long reads and high
sensitivity that allow the characterization of variable or complex
genomic regions. The presented concept is not limited to the measurement
of 5-hmC or to the measurement of a single epigenetic feature. This
fluorescence-based technique relies on color to distinguish different
genomic features. Only the number of specific labeling chemistries
and the spectral properties of the optical measurement system limit
the number of markers that can be detected simultaneously. Thus, further
development of this technique may enable the simultaneous measurement
of 5-hmC and 5-mC, giving a more comprehensive genomic profile of
the cell population as a whole and of cell-to-cell variability in
particular.

Measuring the
Labeling Efficiency of 5-hmC
For the
nicking reaction, 900 ng of lambda phage DNA (New England Biolabs)
was digested with 30 units of Nt.BspQI nicking enzyme (New England
Biolabs) for 2 h at 50 °C in the presence of 3 μL of 10×
buffer 3.1 (New England Biolabs) and ultrapure water to a total volume
of 30 μL. Next, nicked DNA was incubated for 1 h at 72 °C
with 15 units of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), supplemented
with 600 nM of dATP, dGTP, dCTP (Sigma) and atto-532-dUTP (Jena Bioscience),
or dATP, dGTP, dTTP (Sigma) and 5hmdCTP (Zymo Research), in the presence
of 4.5 μL of 10× thermopol buffer (New England Biolabs)
and ultrapure water to a total reaction volume of 45 μL. Following
labeling, DNA was repaired for 30 min at 45 °C with 12 units
of Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1.5 μL
of 10× thermopol buffer, 1 mM NAD+ (New England Biolabs), and
ultrapure water to a total reaction volume of 60 μL. DNA that
was labeled with 5hmdCTP nucleotides was further used for 5-hmC labeling.
A 300 ng portion of nicked DNA was incubated overnight at 37 °C
with 30 units of T4 β-glucosyltransferase (New England Biolabs),
in the presence of 4.5 μL of 10× buffer 4 (New England
Biolabs) and 200 mM homemade UDP-glucose-azide67 in a total reaction volume of 45 μL. Next, dibenzocyclooctyl
(DBCO)-Cy5 (Jena Bioscience) was added to a final concentration of
620 μM and the reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C.
For purification of 5-hmC-labeled DNA from an excess of fluorescent
dyes, plugs were generated by adding agarose to the DNA (see the “High-Molecular-Weight DNA Extraction” section)
to a final agarose concentration of 0.8% and were then washed extensively
with TE (pH 8) on a horizontal shaker. Plugs were melted and purified
by drop dialysis using a 0.1 μm dialysis membrane (Millipore)
floated on TE (pH 8). DNA from both labeling reactions was stained
with YOYO-1 staining solution (BioNano Genomics) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and gently mixed together with
wide bore tips until homogeneous. DNA concentration was measured by
a Qubit HS dsDNA assay. Labeled DNA was loaded in nanochannels and
imaged on an Irys system (BioNano Genomic Inc.).

Images were
processed by the IrysView software package (version 2.3, BioNano Genomics)
to detect individual molecules and positions of labels along each
molecule. In accordance with the length of the lambda phage genome
(48.5 kbp), only molecules that were 40–60 kbp in length were
used for downstream analysis. Additionally, only labels with SNR ≥
2.75 were considered. For each molecule, the number of 5-hmC labels
(red channel) or the number of fluorescent nucleotides (green channel)
were counted (in-house software). Molecules labeled in both colors
were considered noise and discarded from the data set.

High-Molecular-Weight
DNA Extraction
Human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood
of a healthy donor by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll
Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PBMCs were trapped in agarose plugs to protect DNA from
shearing during the labeling process.68 Samples were prepared according to the IrysPrep Plug Lysis Long
DNA Isolation Protocol (Bionano Genomics Inc.) with slight modifications.
Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS,
resuspended in cell suspension buffer (CHEF mammalian DNA extraction
kit, Bio-Rad), and incubated at 43 °C for 10 min. 2% low melting
agarose (CleanCut agarose, Bio-Rad) was melted at 70 °C followed
by incubation at 43 °C for 10 min. Melted agarose was added to
the resuspended cells at a final concentration of 0.7% and mixed gently.
The mixture was immediately cast into a plug mold, and plugs were
incubated at 4 °C until solidified. Plugs were incubated twice
(2 h of incubation followed by an overnight incubation) at 50 °C
with 167 μL of freshly prepared proteinase K (Qiagen) in 2.5
mL of lysis buffer (BioNano Genomics Inc.) with occasional shaking.
Next, plugs were incubated with 50 μL of RNase (Qiagen) in 2.5
mL of TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) for 1 h at 37 °C with
occasional shaking. Plugs were washed three times by adding 10 mL
of wash buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 50 mM EDTA), manually shaking for
10 s, and discarding the wash buffer before adding the next wash.
Plugs were then washed four times by adding 10 mL of wash buffer and
shaking for 15 min on a horizontal platform mixer at 180 rpm at room
temperature. Following washes, plugs were stored at 4 °C in wash
buffer or used for labeling. In order to extract high-molecular-weight
DNA, plugs were washed three times in TE (pH 8) and were melted
for 2 min at 70 °C, followed by 5 min of incubation at 43 °C.
Next, 0.4 units of Gelase (Epicenter) were added and the mixture was
incubated for 45 min. High-molecular-weight DNA was purified by drop
dialysis using a 0.1 μm dialysis membrane (Millipore) floated
on TE (pH 8). Viscous DNA was gently pipetted and incubated at room
temperature overnight in order to achieve homogeneity. DNA concentration
was determined using Qubit BR dsDNS assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Genetic/Epigenetic Labeling and Data Collection
Genetic
labeling was performed using either the commercial IrysPrep NLRS assay
(Bionano Genomics Inc.) or an in-house developed alternative protocol
(see “Measuring the Labeling Efficiency
of 5-hmC” section). A 900 ng portion of high-molecular-weight
DNA from PBMCs was subjected to a nick-translation reaction with Nt.BspQI
for nicking and atto-532-dUTP for labeling. For labeling of 5-hmC,44 nick-labeled DNA was incubated overnight at
37 °C with 90 units of T4 β-glucosyltransferase (New England
Biolabs), in the presence of 13.5 μL of 10× buffer 4 (New
England Biolabs), 200 mM UDP-glucose-azide,67 and ultrapure water (135 μL total reaction volume). Next,
dibenzocyclooctyl (DBCO)-Cy5 (Jena Bioscience) was added to a final
concentration of 620 μM and the reaction was incubated overnight
at 37 °C. For purification of labeled DNA from excess fluorescent
dye, plugs were prepared by adding agarose to the DNA as described
above to a final agarose concentration of 0.8%. Plugs were then washed
extensively with TE (pH 8) on a horizontal shaker. Plugs were melted
and purified by drop dialysis as described, and DNA was stained with
YOYO-1 staining solution (BioNano Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions with the addition of 25 mM Tris (pH 8) and 30 mM NaCl.
DNA concentration was measured by the Qubit HS dsDNA assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). For evaluation of photobleaching steps, labeled
DNA was stretched on glass coverslips and imaged. For optical mapping
experiments, labeled DNA was loaded into nanochannel-array Irys Chips
and imaged on an Irys system (BioNano Genomics Inc.).

Evaluation
of 5-hmC Sites per Detected Fluorescent Spot
Due to the diffraction-limited
resolution of optical mapping, a single
fluorescent spot may contain more than a single 5-hmC site. We used
single-molecule photobleaching to assess the distribution of sites
per spot in the studied DNA sample, in order to correct for any bias
caused by this potential underestimation. DNA molecules that were
labeled with Cy5 to indicate 5-hmC locations and their backbone stained
with YOYO-1 were stretched on modified coverslips prepared as previously
described44 with minor modifications. In
short, 22 × 22 mm2 glass coverslips were cleaned for
7 h to overnight by incubation in a freshly made 2:1 (v/v) mixture
of 70% nitric acid and 37% hydrochloric acid. After extensive washing
with ultrapure water (18 MΩ) and then with ethanol 96%, coverslips
were dried under a stream of nitrogen. Dry coverslips were immersed
in a premixed silane solution containing 750 μL of N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride and 200 μL of vinyltrimethoxysilane
in 300 mL of ultrapure water and incubated overnight at 65 °C.
After incubation, coverslips were thoroughly washed with ultrapure
water and ethanol and stored at 4 °C in ethanol. The silane solution
was freshly made and thoroughly mixed before the coverslips were introduced
into the mixture. Stored coverslips were normally used within 2 weeks.
Prelabeled and stained DNA was diluted to a final concentration of
0.25 ng/μL in TE (pH 8) and 0.2 M DTT. DNA molecules were stretched
on the silanized glass coverslips by placing 6 μL of diluted
DNA between a dry silanized coverslip and a nontreated microscope
slide.

The extended DNA molecules were imaged on an Olympus
IX81 microscope adapted for laser-fluorescence microscopy. A 637 nm
CW laser diode (Coherent, OBIS 637LX) and a 473 nm CW laser (OEM,
200 mW) were used as excitation sources for the 5-hmC Cy5 labels and
YOYO-1 intercalating backbone staining dye, respectively. Excitation
light was focused on the back aperture of a 100× oil immersion
objective (Olympus, UPlanSApo 100×/N.A 1.4) with an average excitation
power density of  in the sample plane. Sample fluorescence
was collected by the same objective and imaged through a polychroic
beamsplitter (Chroma, ZT473/532/637 rpc-xt890) and emission filter
(Semrock, 679/41 Brightline) onto an electron multiplying charge coupled
device (EMCCD) camera (Andor, iXon Ultra 897) with single-molecule
detection sensitivity. All measurements were carried out at room temperature
under ambient conditions. Upon excitation, 5-hmC sites were detected
as fluorescent diffraction limited spots in the field of view (80 ×
80 μm2). Time lapse movies (500 frames, 20 ms/frame)
were acquired for over 100 different fields of view, containing 1000
individual isolated observable 5-hmC marker sites. For each time lapse
movie, individual labels were automatically localized by 2D Gaussian
fitting and manually validated to be isolated fluorescent marks consisting
of a single Gaussian spot and colocalized with a DNA molecule. After
localization, time traces of fluorescence intensity were calculated
for each marker. The intensity was calculated by the average intensity
of a 3 × 3 pixel2 window around the center of each
fitted Gaussian. In order to account for the uneven excitation intensity,
a local background subtraction was performed for each marker by taking
the average intensity of a 7 × 7 pixel2 contour window
around the fitted Gaussian.

The number of photobleaching steps
was manually quantified according
to the number of intensity drops in each time trace. All data analysis
in this section was carried out by a custom-made MATLAB program.

Optical Mapping and Data Analysis
Two optical epigenome
mapping experiments of PBMCs were performed separately, and their
results were combined for downstream analysis.

Raw images were
processed by the IrysView software package (version 2.3, BioNano Genomics
Inc.) to detect individual molecules and positions of genetic and
epigenetic labels along each molecule. Only labels with SNR ≥
2.75 were considered. The positions of genetic labels were used to
align molecules longer than 150 kbp to an in silico generated map of expected Nt.BspQI nicking sites in the hg19 human
reference (IrysView), and only molecules with an alignment confidence
equal or higher than 12 (P ≤ 10–12) were used for downstream analysis. In order to minimize ambiguous
alignments of the overlaid 5-hmC pattern, we filtered out molecules
that were not aligned to the reference for over 60% of their total
length. Genomic positions of epigenetic labels were then extracted
by interpolation, on the basis of the genetic alignment results (in-house
script). 500 bp were added to either side of each label position,
in order to account for optical resolution, and genomic coverage of
both 5-hmC and aligned molecules was calculated using BEDTools (version
2.25.0)69 genomecov. Regions represented
by less than 19 molecules were discarded for downstream analysis,
and molecule coverage was normalized by dividing the coverage in each
genomic position by the maximum coverage. Normalized 5-hmC coverage
was then calculated by dividing the number of detected 5-hmC labels
in each genomic position by the normalized molecule coverage in the
same position.

hMeDIP-seq Library Preparation
DNA
extracted from PBMCs
was used to prepare two sequencing libraries by Epigentek Inc. Each
library included one hMeDIP sample and an input sample. hMeDIP experiments
were performed with 5-hmC monoclonal antibody, using 1.5–4
μg of DNA. Sample libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina
Inc.).

Sequencing Alignment and Data Analysis
Sequencing reads
were aligned to the hg19 human reference using Bowtie 2 (version 2.2.6)70 with default parameters. Following alignment,
reads with MAPQ less than 30 were filtered with SAMtools,71 and the remaining reads were de-duplicated with
Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) to eliminate PCR duplication bias. Reads from the pull-down data
set were extended in the 3′ direction to a total length of
200 bp, in order to account for insert size. Genomic coverage of 5-hmC
and input DNA was calculated using BEDTools genomecov. Due to a low
signal-to-noise ratio in the pull-down experiment, the signal extraction
scaling (SES)72 method was used to estimate
a minimal signal level. Briefly, the genome was divided into 1 kbp
nonoverlapping windows and the number of 5-hmC and input reads in
each window was counted. Windows were then sorted in increasing order
on the basis of 5-hmC counts, and the cumulative sum in each window
was calculated and normalized to the cumulative sum of the complete
data set. The absolute value of the difference between these normalized
sums was calculated for each window, and the minimal signal level
was defined as the 5-hmC counts value in the window where this difference
reached a maximum. On the basis of this calculation, all regions where
the 5-hmC signal was lower than 7 were set to zero. Additionally,
ENCODE-defined signal artifact regions in the hg19 human genome reference73 (https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists) were discarded.

For visual assessment of the correlation
between the hMeDIP-seq results and the optical mapping results, sequencing
coverage resolution was lowered to 1 kbp using a running average calculation.
This was accomplished by dividing the genome into overlapping 1 kbp
windows with a 1 bp shift and calculating the mean 5-hmC coverage
in each window. The calculated mean was then set as the 5-hmC value
in the midpoint genomic position of each window.

Analysis of
Global 5-hmC Distribution across Genomic Features
Transcription
start sites (TSS) were defined according to RefSeq
annotation for hg19 downloaded from the UCSC genome browser database.
H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq data for PBMCs was downloaded as alignment
results from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project (GEO accession numbers
GSM1127143 and GSM1127145, respectively) and converted into genomic
coverage using BEDTools. Enhancer regions were defined by examining
coverage percentiles (>99% percentile for H3K4me1 and >99.5%
for H3K27Ac),
and regions closer than 100 bp apart were merged. 5-hmC counts in
each region were calculated using BEDTools by dividing regions into
equally sized bins (90 bp for H3K4me1, 30 bp for H3K27Ac, and 20 bp
for TSS), computing the mean 5-hmC signal in each bin, and summing
the signal across all bins of equal distance from the region midpoint.
Normalization of values to a 0–1 range was performed separately
for each data set.

Analysis of 5-hmC Correlation to Gene Expression
Expression
data of protein-coding genes for PBMCs was downloaded from the Roadmap
Epigenomics Project as RPKM values (http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byDataType/rna/expression/). Genes were classified into three groups: high expression (5987
genes, log10(RPKM) ≥ 10), low expression
(5741 genes, 1 ≤ log10(RPKM) <
10), and no expression (8074 genes, log10(RPKM) < 1). Mean 5-hmC values along genes were calculated using deepTools74 computeMatrix in scale regions mode. Each gene
was scaled to 15 kbp and divided into 300 bp bins. The mean 5-hmC
score in each bin was calculated, and all scores in the same bin were
summed and normalized to the number of genes in the group.
