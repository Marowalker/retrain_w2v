Carborane-capped
gold nanoparticles (Au/carborane NPs, 2–3
nm) can act as artificial ion transporters across biological membranes.
The particles themselves are large hydrophobic anions that have the
ability to disperse in aqueous media and to partition over both sides
of a phospholipid bilayer membrane. Their presence therefore causes
a membrane potential that is determined by the relative concentrations
of particles on each side of the membrane according to the Nernst
equation. The particles tend to adsorb to both sides of the membrane
and can flip across if changes in membrane potential require their
repartitioning. Such changes can be made either with a potentiostat
in an electrochemical cell or by competition with another partitioning
ion, for example, potassium in the presence of its specific transporter
valinomycin. Carborane-capped gold nanoparticles have a ligand shell
full of voids, which stem from the packing of near spherical ligands
on a near spherical metal core. These voids are normally filled with
sodium or potassium ions, and the charge is overcompensated by excess
electrons in the metal core. The anionic particles are therefore able
to take up and release a certain payload of cations and to adjust
their net charge accordingly. It is demonstrated by potential-dependent
fluorescence spectroscopy that polarized phospholipid membranes of
vesicles can be depolarized by ion transport mediated by the particles.
It is also shown that the particles act as alkali-ion-specific transporters
across free-standing membranes under potentiostatic control. Magnesium
ions are not transported.

==== Body
Ion transport
across biological
membranes is a fundamental phenomenon ubiquitous in nature.1−6 Photosynthesis, the respiratory chain, ATP production, muscle contraction,
neuronal signaling, and many other key biological processes depend
on it.7,8 Numerous active and passive transport mechanisms
exist ranging from simple ion channels to highly complex and regulated
energy-converting nanomachineries. Naturally occurring ion transporters
are proteins, whereas artificial ones can be made in different ways,
usually from peptides,9 macrocyclic organic
compounds,10,11 or appropriately functionalized
polymers including DNA.12−15 Substances that affect ion transport or its regulation
play important roles in both basic research and drug development.
Carborane-capped gold nanoparticles16 in
the 1–4 nm size range are known for their ability to store
and release cationic charge that is counterbalanced by excess electrons
in the metal core.17 This is possible due
to the inevitable voids in the ligand shell, which are caused by the
near spherical shape of the carborane ligand. It may also be assisted
by the dipole moment of the ligand, which in this case is pointing
toward the gold surface. Carboranes have the interesting property
that the orientation of their dipole moment relative to a surface
can be controlled by the position of the two vicinal carbon atoms.18 Gold nanoparticles loaded up with cations readily
disperse in water as net polyanions but, if possible, tend to associate
with water/oil interfaces or with hydrophobic membranes. Unlike most
other nanoscopic forms of gold,19 the particles
are cytotoxic and can enter biological cells by direct membrane penetration
and finally lodge inside membranous structures including the mitochondria.
Here, we report that 2–3 nm gold nanoparticles protected by
mercaptocarborane ligands (a) readily penetrate phospholipid bilayer
membranes and establish a membrane potential as partitioning anions
and (b) effect the transport of alkali cations across the membrane
and hence represent a class of membrane transporters. Two complementary
experimental techniques have been used to study these phenomena: (i)
voltage-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy of dispersions of vesicles
and (ii) potentiometric and potential step experiments across a free-standing
bilayer membrane.

Results and Discussion
We have previously
reported the unexpected ability of the hydrophobic
carborane-capped gold nanoparticles (2–3 nm) to disperse readily
in aqueous media.17 This is due to the
storage of both electronic and ionic charge in the metallic core and
in the ligand shell, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 1. Phase transfer experiments
with cationic transfer agents have established the anionic character
of the nanoparticles, and ion exchange with lithium followed by Li
nuclear magnetic resonance (6Li NMR) spectroscopy has shown
that alkali cations close to the metal surface compensate most of
the excess electronic charge of the metal core. Removal of most charge
by acid treatment renders the particles completely hydrophobic. It
is useful to recall these findings when interpreting the results presented
here.

ligand shell.17

Before studying the ability of these nanoparticles to act
as ion
transporters across biological membranes, it is necessary to consider
their own propensity as large anions to partition across the membrane
and to establish a membrane potential. For this purpose, we used an
established experimental approach to monitor the membrane potential
of phospholipid vesicles by fluorescence spectroscopy using the potential
indicator dye safranin O that partitions between the membrane and
the outer aqueous phase depending on membrane potential.20,21 The fluorescence intensity significantly increases when the dye
molecules reside inside the membrane. Vesicles of 100–200 nm
diameter with a positive ζ-potential (Table S1) were prepared following the method reported by Stupp and
co-workers22 and characterized by dynamic
light scattering (DLS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)
(Figure S1). For calibration purposes,
their membrane potential was controlled by carefully adjusting the
concentrations of K+ ions inside and outside the vesicles
in the presence of the K+-specific transporter valinomycin.
The fluorescence intensity of safranin O was calibrated against the
membrane potential values calculated from the Nernst equation (Figure S2).20,23 If, instead
of valinomycin, the nanoparticles are added, a rapid polarization
of the membrane in the same direction (inside negative) is also observed,
but the final value does not depend on the potassium concentrations
on both sides of the membrane but only on the amount of nanoparticles
added.

This effect is most pronounced in the absence of any
added electrolyte
other than the particles themselves (Figure 2b,c). If electrolytes are present, the polarizing
effect of the Au/carborane NPs differs somewhat for different cations
(Figure S3). We attribute this polarization
to the anionic nanoparticles’ ability to transfer across the
membrane and, in the absence of cation transport, to determine the
membrane potential as the only partitioning ion. They are self-transporting
partitioning ions. To quantify this in terms of a Nernst equilibrium,
it is necessary to control the concentrations of nanoparticles on
both sides of the membrane, which is not possible with the vesicle
system but can be achieved using a droplet interface bilayer (DIB)
separating two independently accessible electrolyte solutions, as
elegantly demonstrated by Bayley et al. (Figure S4a).24−26 The results are presented
in Figure 2d. Although
these direct measurements of membrane potential in this system are
experimentally challenging and hence somewhat noisy, the results are
robust and fully commensurate with the predictions from the Nernst
equation. Also, the average charge per particle can now be inferred
as −6 in 1 mM sodium chloride and −3 in 100 mM sodium
chloride. At this stage, there is no evidence that the particles are
capable of transporting ions across the membrane other than themselves.

of membrane polarization after addition of anionic Au/carborane NPs
to the aqueous medium outside the vesicles. While the particles readily
transfer across the membrane, counterions remain on the outside of
the vesicle. (b) Fluorescence response to the addition of Au/carborane
NPs in a range of different concentrations in the absence of electrolyte.
Note that polyethylene glycol-coated gold nanoparticles (Au/PEG-OH
NPs) have no effect. (c) Membrane potential estimated from the data
presented in (b). (d) Plot derived from the Nernst equation for two
different NaCl concentrations. The membrane potentials were directly
measured using a DIB cell (Figure S4a).
Note the dependence of the charge of the Au/carborane NPs on the NaCl
concentration, −3 at 100 mM and −6 at 1 mM. This is
likely to be the case also for other alkali ions that can enter the
ligand shell.

A different scenario
presents itself when the membrane is first
polarized by the presence of a potassium gradient using the potassium-specific
transporter valinomycin (less than 2 molecules per vesicle). Figure 3a,b show how the
membrane potential is built up and reaches its saturation value. If
then the gold nanoparticles are added (1 to 2 particles per vesicle),
an initial fast but small decline in fluorescence intensity is always
observed. We interpret this as an artifact perhaps due to quenching
and/or reabsorption of light by the metallic particle.

Figure 3 Monitoring the fluorescence
of safranin O to probe the polarization
and depolarization of the vesicle membrane. (a) All three traces show
the initial polarization of the membrane after addition of valinomycin
(11 nM) in the presence of safranin O (180 nM) in the medium outside
the vesicles. The concentration of KCl was 100 mM inside and 0.1 mM
outside the vesicles, and that of NaCl was 1 mM inside and 100.9 mM
outside, which gives a positive polarity outside. Addition of Au/PEG-OH
(20 nM) particles (black trace) leads to a rapid small decrease in
fluorescence intensity but none attributable to change in membrane
potential. This indicates that no charge is transferred by these particles.
When instead Au/carborane NPs (20 nM) are added (red trace), besides
the familiar small change in signal, the fluorescence decreased exponentially
over 600 s. This is attributed to influx of sodium and efflux of potassium
ions mediated by Au/carborane NPs and valinomycin. (b) Same as the
red trace in (a) but with different potassium ions gradients, i.e., different saturation potentials. Depolarization of
the membrane to a final value by Au/carborane NPs occurs over a wide
range of potentials. (c) Red trace shows the same experiment as in
(a), but the NPs were added first followed by addition of valinomycin
(300 s). After the initial small polarization caused by NPs themselves,
the membrane is polarized further upon addition of valinomycin. Note
that after further polarization to an onset overpotential depolarization
occurs as in (a) and (b). (d) Overpotentials for the onset of depolarization
(black) and final potentials after depolarization (red) as a function
of saturation membrane potential given by the potassium ion gradient
(Figure S5).

Then, the fluorescence intensity decreases, gradually approaching
a constant final value that quite accurately corresponds to the membrane
potential the particles alone would have caused. The effective canceling
of the potential initially determined by the potassium gradient is
explained by the influx of Na+ and the efflux of K+ ions both from high to low concentration, indicating that
the gold nanoparticles added under these conditions do provide a mechanism
for Na+ transport across the membrane as well as for K+, in addition to valinomycin. As there are now transporters
for sodium and potassium present in the membrane, both ions can freely
flow in and out until their concentrations inside and outside the
vesicles are equal and they cause the membrane potential to drop to
zero (really to the small value determined by the partitioning of
the nanoparticles). For a discussion of transport rates see Supporting Information (Index 7). While the nanoparticles
were not found to transport ions that polarize the membrane, this
experiment shows unequivocally that they support ion transport to
depolarize the membrane in the presence of a competing polarizing
mechanism. For comparison, if instead, our standard Au/PEG–OH
nanoparticles of the same size are added, only the initial fast drop
in signal intensity is observed but no subsequent depolarization of
the membrane.27 An unexpected phenomenon
is revealed by an experiment identical to that shown in (Figure 3a,b) except that
the nanoparticles are now added before the addition
of valinomycin rather than afterward. The result is shown in Figure 3c. Upon addition
of the particles, as expected, a small membrane potential is generated
(30–40 mV inside negative) due to the partitioning of the anionic
particles. When then valinomycin is added, the membrane
is further polarized, making the inside more negative due to the increased
K+ selectivity of the membrane induced by valinomycin.
This initially confirms that the nanoparticles do not transport ions
under these conditions, until the membrane potential reaches a value
of 20–30 mV more negative inside than the potential caused
by the particles alone. At this point, the membrane suddenly begins
to depolarize gradually to the original value determined by the nanoparticles.
We suggest that this empirical overpotential for depolarization is
needed to activate the repartitioning of nanoparticles if they have
prepolarized the membrane by having been added to one side only. After
this initial polarization, the anionic particles will reside predominantly
on the inside of the vesicles and will first have to cross the membrane
before they can support the influx of sodium ions. The observed overpotential
is always between 20 and 30 mV negative of the equilibrium potential
caused by the particles alone. We believe that this would disappear
if we had an equal concentration of particles on both sides of the
membrane, which in the present system is experimentally not possible.
A further shortcoming of this experimental approach is that we can
only measure membrane potentials with an outside positive/inside negative
polarity as it was not possible to prepare the vesicles with the potential
sensitive dye incorporated inside, which would have been necessary
to measure membrane potentials of opposite polarity. Also, ionic currents
across the membranes are inferred but are not measured directly. To
overcome these limitations and to validate our findings independently
by an alternative method, we used planar bilayer membranes separated
by two compartments of a small 3D-printed electrochemical cell (Figure S4b).28,29 These are
conceptually similar to the DIB that have been used to measure the
membrane potential caused by the partitioning of the nanoparticles.
The current responses to alternating potential steps of up to −80/+80
mV applied across the membrane were recorded under various conditions.
The results are shown in Figure 4. While sodium and potassium are both transported readily
with a small preference for potassium, significant differences are
found when comparing sodium and magnesium (Figure 4c,d). The intercept of −40 mV in Figure 4d indicates a clear
preference for sodium over magnesium. This selectivity has also been
observed by electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) mass
spectrometry after ion exchange experiments (Figure S6).

Figure 4 Current–voltage responses in potential step experiments
on free-standing phospholipid bilayer membranes. (a) Current traces
in response to potential steps of −80/+80 mV. The electrochemical
cells are color coded underneath. Note that the largest currents are
obtained in the presence of steep gradients of potassium and sodium
concentrations across the membrane. (b) I–V curves corresponding to (a). Each point represents the
steady-state current of the potential step experiment. The graph has
been corrected to eliminate a small offset current (3–4 pA)
that is present even in the absence of NPs. The intercept of +8 mV
shows that K+ is preferentially transported over Na+. (c,d) Same as (a) and (b) but using sodium and magnesium
instead. The intercept at −40 mV shows that sodium is transported
preferentially to magnesium. This selectivity also indicates that
simple defect formation in the membrane can be excluded as a transport
mechanism.

The information provided by both
approaches is consistent. The
vesicle experiments have established that the nanoparticles act as
cation transporters when they depolarize the membrane. Importantly,
all attempts failed to polarize the membrane with partitioning ions
that use the nanoparticles as transporter. Only the nanoparticles
themselves can polarize the membrane regardless of the presence and
concentration differences of other ions in the system. The depolarization
of a prepolarized membrane is not possible if sodium is replaced by
magnesium (Figure 5a,b), confirming the very low affinity of the particles for magnesium
established by the electrochemical study. Further polarization of
a prepolarized membrane is also not possible (Figure 5c,d), further confirming that the particles
only transport ions if the resulting flow depolarizes the membrane.
In this sense, the particles behave differently from a transporter
such as valinomycin, which can be used to polarize the membrane with
a potassium gradient. The particles alone will not do this; instead
they always establish a membrane potential that is due to their own
partitioning as anions.

Figure 5 (a) Polarization with potassium gradient after
addition of valinomycin.
Addition of Au/carborane NPs does not lead to depolarization if magnesium
is chosen as the partitioning ion. (b) Same as (a) but the Au/carborane
NPs were added before addition of valinomycin at 300 s. Again no depolarization
occurs. (c) Polarization with potassium gradient after addition of
valinomycin and attempt to further polarize the membrane using Au/carborane
NPs as a transporter and sodium as partitioning ion. (d) Same as (c)
but the NPs were added before of addition of valinomycin. All electrolyte
concentrations are given in the insets.

The inability to polarize the membrane by the transport of
cations
in the presence of a concentration gradient strongly suggests that
the particles do not simply open channels through which ions can freely
flow across the membrane. A shuttle mechanism is more likely by which
the particles fill up with cations on the side of high concentration,
flip across the membrane, and release them on the side of low concentration,
probably becoming more negative upon cation release unless the empty
vacancies are immediately filled up with other cations. Only if the
cations are released on the negatively polarized side of the membrane
(depolarization) can the membrane potential push back the negatively
charged particle to the positive side, where it is replenished with
cations and the process repeats. Our current understanding of this
process is summarized in Figure 6. Release of cations on the positive side of the membrane
(polarization) would stop the process as the particle would remain
trapped on that side of the membrane. The vesicle experiments also
revealed that membrane depolarization requires an overpotential which
we attribute to having the particles only added to one side of the
membrane. Indeed, the electrochemical experiments do not show this
overpotential and further seem to suggest that the particles act as
transporters much like valinomycin (Figure S7). This is because by the very nature of these experiments, under
potentiostatic control, the membrane is always polarized in such a
way that cations cross the membrane from the positive to the negative
side. The unusual property of the particles not to support a polarizing
flow of cations would thus not have been noticed by the electrochemical
investigation alone.

Figure 6 Scheme of membrane depolarization by transport of sodium
and potassium
ions. (I) Particles are added to the sodium rich dispersion of vesicles
and adsorb to the vesicle membrane (Figure S8). Note, the membrane has been polarized (outside positive) by the
presence of a potassium ion concentration gradient and the potassium
specific carrier valinomycin (not shown). (II) As the particles penetrate
the membrane, sodium ions are released inside the vesicle (down their
concentration gradient). (III) As long as particles reside within
the membrane, they can shuttle sodium ions across by passive transport
down their concentration gradient. In parallel with the mechanism
provided by valinomycin, the particles could also contribute to the
export of potassium. The process stops when the concentrations of
sodium and potassium inside and outside the vesicles are equal. The
remaining potential of the depolarized membrane is then due to the
partitioning of the anionic nanoparticles.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated by two complementary
experimental
approaches that cation transport across phospholipid membranes can
be facilitated by ligand-capped gold nanoparticles, which by themselves
are large partitioning anions that form a Nernst equilibrium and result
in the buildup of a membrane potential. Electrochemical experiments
have established little selectivity within the alkali ions tested
but high selectivity of alkali over alkaline earth ions. A condition
for the particles’ activity as transporters is that the membrane
potential is kept away from the equilibrium potential determined by
the particles. This is done by either providing a chemical potential
difference and an ion selective pathway or by controlling the membrane
potential directly with a potentiostat. In the absence of both, the
particles do not act as transporters for any ions but themselves and
cannot be used, for example, like valinomycin, to polarize a membrane
with a suitable partitioning ion.

Our findings establish functionalized
nanoparticles as a class
of ion transporters with some interesting properties. The phenomena
observed suggest a simple model of a nanoscale electrostatically driven
shuttle. The presence of the metallic core should, in parallel, enable
electronic conduction which would create interesting opportunities
for the use of biological membranes. The design of nano- and microscale
systems with coupled electronic and ionic transport between compartments
separated by a membrane is the subject of ongoing research in our
laboratories.

Methods
Chemicals
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were supplied
by Aldrich. Both cationic liposome kit and asolectin
from soybean were purchased from Sigma. HS-C11-PEG4-OH was supplied by ProChimia. The cationic exchange resin,
strongly acidic PA with a total exchange capacity of 2.0 mequiv/mL,
and a water content of 46–52%, loaded with the desired cation
chloride was provided by Panreac. Mercaptocarborane, 1-SH-1,2-closo-C2B10H11, was synthesized
according to the literature.30,31 All salts were purchased
from Sigma. Synthetic grade methanol, ethanol, and Milli-Q-grade (MQ)
water were used in all preparations.

Unilamellar Vesicles
A 10 mM stock solution of phospholipids
was made by dilution of lyophilized powder from a liposome kit (cholesterol
9 μmol, l-α-phosphatidylcholine 63 μmol,
stearylamine 18 μmol) in chloroform.22,23 One milliliter aliquots of the stock solution were rotary evaporated
to dryness and for a further 2 h in order to remove all residues of
organic solvent. MQ water or KCl, Na2SO4, K2SO4 buffer solutions were used to hydrate the phospholipids
depending on the requirements of each experiment (agitate overnight).
In order to make the suspension of phospholipids more homogeneous,
it was heated to 60 °C followed by 6–9 freeze–thaw
cycles using liquid nitrogen. Next, the homogeneous phospholipid solution
was extruded 20 times through a mini-extruder (Avanti) with a 100
nm pore-size polycarbonate filter (Whatman) to form vesicles of about
100 nm diameters. Purification of such prepared vesicles and buffer
exchange were carried out by using dialysis tubing MWCO 12000–14000
(Serva).

Preparation of Ligand-Capped 2–3 nm Gold Nanoclusters
Both Au/PEG-OH and Au/carborane gold nanoclusters were synthesized
following a literature method.17 All the
reaction components were mixed in the following final concentrations:
capping agents [HS-C11-PEG4-OH] or [mercaptocarborane]
= 3 mM, [HAuCl4] = 3 mM, [NaBH4] = 9.5 mM. In
the case of mercaptocarborane-capped gold nanoclusters solvent was
rota evaporated followed by washing of excess capping agent molecules
with diethyl ether. In the final step, dark-brown residue was dissolved
in isopropyl alcohol and filtered to remove the remaining sodium borohydride
and other insoluble contaminants. PEGylated gold nanoclusters were
washed by using ultra-high-speed centrifuge at 163000 rcf for 1 h,
and the pellet was redispersed in a 9:1 mixture of water and ethanol.
In total, the purification process was repeated three times where
final product was redispersed in MQ water only. All particles were
additionally characterized by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy
(UV–vis), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Figures S9 and S10).

Membrane Potential Changes
Monitored by Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The suspension of
vesicles with a final concentration of phospholipids
of 1 mM was placed in a fluorimetric cuvette followed by addition
of the potential probe dye safranin O (180 nM final concentration).
Then the fluorescence intensity was allowed to equilibrate for 2 min.
The kinetic mode was used to detect continuous fluorescence intensity
changes at 589 nm with an excitation wavelength of 521 nm. In membrane
depolarization experiments, concentrations varying from 11 to 15 nM
valinomycin, and 20 nM Au/carborane NPs were used. The fluorescence
intensity was monitored over 2000 s. Experiments including NaCl, KCl,
and MgCl2 salts were performed at a pH range of 6.8–6.9.
Experiment including sulfates (Figure 5c,d) was carried out in similar pH values 6.8–6.9
using 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer.

Membrane Formation in the
Droplet Interface Bilayer Cell
The chamber of a 3D-printed
polyacrylamide cell (Figure S4a) was filled
with aqueous electrolyte (300 μL),
and then a lipid-containing decane solution (150 μL) was added
on the top, so that a lipid monolayer formed at the interface. A droplet
of electrolyte (∼3 μL) was pipetted onto an agarose-coated
Ag/AgCl electrode and maneuvered, using a micromanipulator, so that
the droplet was in the lipid–decane solution, where a monolayer
of lipids surrounded the droplet. It was then moved to be in contact
with the interface monolayer, where a bilayer membrane formed between
the two aqueous phases. The formation of the membranes was tracked
by using electrochemical methods. The average value of capacitance
of membranes created using this procedure was 16 ± 2 nF, and
resistance was in the range of 108–109 Ω. In each experiment, the membrane was formed with equal
electrolyte and Au/carborane NP concentration in both aqueous phases
called “in” and “out” (Figure S4a). Thereafter, gradual addition (via micropipette) of Au/carborane NPs to underlying planar aqueous medium
(out) built up the concentration gradient of NPs across the membrane.

Formation of the Supported Planar Bilayer Membranes
Two
Ag/AgCl electrodes were each fixed into one of two compartments
of a 3D-printed polyacrylamide cell, with an aperture of ∼270
μm diameter separating the two compartments (Figure S4b). Electrolyte solution (200 μL) was added
into each compartment to cover the electrodes, but not enough for
the aqueous phase to reach the aperture. Fifty microliters of phospholipid
solution made of asolectin from soybean mixture dissolved in decane
(25 mg/mL) was added on top of the aqueous phase and left for 20 min
for monolayers to form at the interface between the aqueous and organic
phases. The monolayers were brought into contact by raising the level
of the aqueous phase, via alternating micropipette
additions of electrolyte into each compartment, until the aperture
was fully submerged. The formation of the membrane was monitored by
cyclic voltammetry using a Metrohm μAutolab III potentiostat
and confirmed via capacitance and resistance measurements.
In a standard experiment, capacitance of the formed membrane was in
the range of 80–170 pF, yielding average specific capacitance
value of 0.248 ± 0.06 μF/cm2. Specific resistance
of such formed membranes was in the range of 107–108 Ω·cm2.32 In each experiment, either NPs or valinomycin were added to both
sides cis and trans of phospholipid
bilayer membrane, reaching their final concentration of 200 nM. All
experiments were carried out at a pH range of 7.1–7.2 using
20 mM MOPS buffer (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid).

ζ-Potential and DLS Measurements
The ζ-potential
measurements were performed on the earlier purified nanoparticles
and vesicle solutions. Three measurements, each including 10 runs,
were used to estimate average ζ-potential value. Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZS Zen3600 was used for both ζ-potential and DLS measurements.

Infrared
Colloidal suspensions of gold nanoparticles
were deposited on IR windows by using a drop-casting method. Aqueous
solutions of Au/PEG-OH were drop-casted on the ZnSe and Au/carborane
NPs suspended in ethanol on the CaF2 IR windows. Powder
of pure mercaptocarborane ligand was characterized by using attenuated
total reflection (ATR) mode.

HR-TEM
The Au NP samples were prepared
by drop-casting
3 μL of Au NP colloidal dispersion onto a holey carbon film,
300 mesh copper TEM grid (Agar Scientific), which was then dried in
air for an hour before insertion into the microscope. HR-TEM was performed
on a JEOL JEM 2100FCs equipped with a spherical aberration corrector
(CEOS GmbH), operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

Cryo-TEM
Holey carbon film, 300 mesh, or Quantifoil
R2/2, 200 mesh copper TEM grids (Agar Scientific), was glow-discharged
in a Quorum 150T S turbo-pumped glow-discharge system. The samples
were prepared by mixing the lipid vesicle solution with 50 nM colloidal
dispersion of Au NPs. Three microliters of the prepared solution was
drop-casted onto a glow-discharged TEM grid placed inside an FEI Vitrobot
Mk2 vitrification system that was set to 8 °C and relative humidity
of 98%. The samples were blotted 2 × 2 s before being plunged
into liquid ethane. Vitrified samples were transferred onto a Gatan
626 cryogenic sample holder and imaged on an FEI Tecnai Spirit G2
BioTWIN TEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV, using
an Olympus-SIS MegaView III digital camera. Cryo-TEM imaging was performed
in low-dose mode (electron beam current density of 6.3 e–/Å2 s, with the total electron
dose per imaged area of <50 e–/Å2) at a defocus ranging from −0.5 to −1.5
μm. During cryo-TEM, the sample holder temperature was maintained
below −179 °C.

The acquired electron microscopy
images were processed using ImageJ 1.46r software (NIH).

Ion Exchange
and MALDI-TOF MS
To replace the sodium
counterbalancing ions by Li+, approximately 100 mg of prepared
sodium-loaded Au/carborane NPs were dissolved in water. Then, the
solution was passed repeatedly through a lithium ion exchange column
and subsequently analyzed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy.17 Moreover, we interchanged the initial Na+ cation with K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, by passing a solution of water-soluble sodium reached Au/carborane
nanoparticles through the cation-exchange resin previously loaded
with the corresponding cation (K+, Mg2+, and
Ca2+). ESI-TOF mass spectra of the ethanol solutions of
the Au/carborane NPs after the ion exchange were measured in the positive-ion
mode using a home-built mass spectrometer.33 Results showed that Na+ can be interchanged only by other
alkali metals such as Li+ or K+. With alkali-earth
metals, such as Mg2+ and Ca2+, there is no cation
exchange even if the aqueous solution of the Au/carborane is passed
more than 7 times through the resin as represented in (Figure S6).
