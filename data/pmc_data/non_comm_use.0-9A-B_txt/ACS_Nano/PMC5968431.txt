The
possibility of investigating small amounts of molecules, moieties,
or nano-objects dispersed in solution constitutes a central step for
various application areas in which high sensitivity is necessary.
Here, we show that the rapid expansion of a water bubble can act as
a fast-moving net for molecules or nano-objects, collecting the floating
objects in the surrounding medium in a range up to 100 μm. Thanks
to an engineered 3D patterning of the substrate, the collapse of the
bubble could be guided toward a designed area of the surface with
micrometric precision. Thus, a locally confined high density of particles
is obtained, ready for evaluation by most optical/spectroscopic detection
schemes. One of the main relevant strengths of the long-range capture
and delivery method is the ability to increase, by a few orders of
magnitude, the local density of particles with no changes in their
physiological environment. The bubble is generated by an ultrafast
IR laser pulse train focused on a resonant plasmonic antenna; due
to the excitation process, the technique is trustworthy and applicable
to biological samples. We have tested the reliabilities of the process
by concentrating highly dispersed fluorescence molecules and fluorescent
beads. Lastly, as an ultimate test, we have applied the bubble clustering
method on nanosized exosome vesicles dispersed in water; due to the
clustering effect, we were able to effectively perform Raman spectroscopy
on specimens that were otherwise extremely difficult to measure.

==== Body
The possibility
of investigating
small amounts of molecules, moieties, or nano-objects dispersed in
solution constitutes a key point for several fields in which high
sensitivity is necessary, such as biodynamics, environmental and pollution
control, and early diagnostics in medicine. One of the most common
difficulties is related to the diffusion limit that affects nanostructured
sensors working in solution. Namely, when dealing with nanostructured
devices with small areas, the average time necessary to detect an
event increases exponentially as the solute concentration decreases.
In this regard, several techniques aiming at processing highly diluted
samples down to the single-molecule limit were developed. Despite
the wide range of available approaches,1−4 the investigation of biomolecules5 or nanosized objects in their physiological conditions
is still an open issue.

A clear example of the current limitations
is given by the difficulties
in managing and analyzing extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs).6 EVs captured the attention of biologists during
recent decades as key components of intercellular communication. Almost
all types of cells release a variety of vesicles in the extracellular
milieu or in the culture medium, characterized by different compositions,
sizes, and intracellular origins. Exosomes, a subset of EVs derived
from blood or other biological fluids, have been proposed as diagnostic
and/or prognostic tools for specific pathological conditions.6−11 The difficulties in processing these kinds of biological materials
are related to their very small size, which is below the current detection
limit of flow cytometry. Furthermore, they show rapid degradation
when physiological conditions are not maintained. Microfluidic systems
and lab-on-chip devices may provide significant advances in this direction,
and recently, different methods based on optofluidics and bubble generations12 were proposed to improve the detection of analyte
in solution. Additionally, a pioneering method for the long-range
and rapid transport of individual nano-objects based on electrothermoplasmonic
nanotweezers2 was recently described.

In this work, we show that bubbles generated in water by laser
excitation of three-dimensional plasmonic nanoantennas enable the
long-range capture of molecules dispersed in solution and their delivery
toward a predefined area of micrometric size. Therefore, it is possible
to overcome the diffusion limit without compromising the physiological
environment; the concept is sketched in Figure 1. A vertical plasmonic nanoantenna in a liquid
environment is illuminated with a short laser pulse to generate gas
bubbles, whose fast expansion promotes the capture of surrounding
molecules. Being detached from the sample surface, the generated bubble
is almost free to move. The presence of a vertical panel in proximity
to the antenna prevents the bubble from following random kinetic pathways,
thus pushing it into the basket on the other side with a success rate
very close to 100%. In the final step, the bubble collapses and deposits
the molecules into the target (Supporting Information Video SI). In the first part of the work, we
investigate the proposed method by using small fluorescent molecules
and nanobeads. In the second part, we show that EVs can be accumulated
in micrometric areas and then investigated without compromising the
physiological analysis environment (i.e., salt concentration,
pH, temperature). We used fluorescence microscopy and Raman scattering
as investigation methods; however, we note that the delivery and clustering
protocol can be easily integrated with most optical/spectroscopic
detection schemes.

Figure 1 Sketch shows the 3D nanostructured sample with the antennas,
deflecting
panels (boards) and target sites (baskets). The main steps of the
collapsing bubble dynamics are also schematically shown, from left
to right, by the first line of structures: (a) bubble generation by
the laser pulses, (b) asymmetry in the collapsing process, (c) final
collapse of the bubble, and (d) target site filled by nanoparticles
and analytes ready for the tests.

Results and Discussion
The generation of bubbles in liquid
is a complex topic that has
been widely investigated in the literature.13−15 Bubbles could
be generated by a large variety of methods, spanning from laser irradiation16−18 with pulsed sources19−21 to syringe inflation22 and others. Among them, laser irradiation of plasmonic structures
is a topic of great interest because it allows one to localize cavitation
phenomena on nanosized areas, thus not affecting the overall temperature
of the studied system.23−25 Usually, cavitation can be induced by local heating
following the resonant absorption of excitation wavelength by nanoparticles,26−29 but this approach often leads to melting and damage of the structures.30,31 Literature also reports examples of localized plasma generation
by the scattered near-field in off-resonance nanoparticles, which
was exploited to create vapor bubbles around particles.23−25,32 In this method, laser pulses
in the near-infrared region are focused, from the back side, on a
vertical plasmonic antenna (Figure 1) (gold, 4 μm high, 200 nm diameter), thus producing
a tightly confined and enhanced electromagnetic field at the antenna’s
tip. For fabrication details of the structures used in the experiments,
see our previous works.33,34 If the electromagnetic
field exceeds a given threshold, electrons are ejected from the antenna
to the surrounding medium, where they are accelerated by the plasmonic
field through a process called pondermotive acceleration.23 Electrons can gain further kinetic energy through
inverse bremsstrahlung and are involved in elastic and inelastic collisions
with water molecules, leading to energy transfer and ionization phenomena.
If the electron density overcomes the optical breakdown threshold,
this process results in plasma formation. Then, a strong energy transfer
from the plasma to the water occurs, resulting in the generation of
a pressure wave and eventually of a cavitation bubble. This process
does not affect the local temperature of the surrounding water as
the plasma is strongly confined on the tip of the antenna but also
does not impact the temperature of the gold lattice because the gold
substrate provides an efficient relaxation pathway even in resonant
absorption conditions.24 The control of
the parameters, such as laser power, pulse train duration, and size
of the irradiation spot, allowed us fine control of the bubble generation.
By using this approach, we were able to create bubbles that expanded
up to 100 μm in less than 100 ms. In the following experiments,
we excited the antennas at λ = 850 nm, with rather long pulse
trains (from 15 to 100 ms) made of 200 fs pulses, with a 78 MHz repetition
rate and an average power from 30 to 150 mW (pulse energy equal to
0.4–2 nJ). The laser was focused on the back side of the nanoantenna
through a 60× objective (Olympus LUCPLAN FLN 60×, NA = 0.7),
which produces a laser spot with a beam waist of approximately 700
nm hwhm, as estimated by a Gaussian fit of the intensity profile,
while imaging was operated by means of a 60× water immersion
objective (Olympus LMPLANFL, NA = 1.0). A sketch of the optical setup
can be found in the Supporting Information.

We note that, under the conditions used in our experiments,
the
proprieties of biomolecules suspended in solution are not affected
by the laser pulses or by the bubble generation. In fact, the irradiation
of the laser from the back side of the membrane avoids any direct
interaction with the solution. Moreover, the absorption of the NIR
laser (λ = 850 nm) for biological species can be considered
negligible. We would also emphasize that the mechanism exploited to
generate bubbles is not a thermal process; therefore, no significant
change in the temperature of the surrounding liquid is required.

Trapping
of Objects during the Rapid Expansion of the Bubble
It is
well-known that colloidal particles and bacterial strains
are inclined to be trapped at the air–water interface,35,36 and this interfacial accumulation of colloidal particles is the
result of surface tension effects. In fact, as long as two liquids
or fluids are immiscible, it is thermodynamically favorable for a
particle to adsorb to the interface, regardless whether the particle
is hydrophobic or hydrophilic (although hydrophobic interactions promote
the accumulation).35,36 Once a particle has been located
at an infinitely large interface, the energy gain is  where rp is the
radius of particle, γwa is the interfacial energy
of the water–air interface, and θ is the wetting angle
of the particle. Considering values rp ≈ 2 × 10–7 m, γwa = 73 × 10–3 N/m, and θ ≈ 85°
(as for polystyrene beads), the equation results in ΔE ≈ 9 × 10–15 J, which is
much larger than the room temperature energy.

The drag force, Fd = 6πηrpv (with η being dynamic viscosity and v being relative velocity between liquid and particle),
cannot contribute to the detachment of the particles, and it actually
contributes to the accumulation. In fact, in the case of a static
interface, the accumulation of particles is mainly a diffusion-limited
process, depending on the particle arrival rate at the interface.
In the presence of a moving interface, as in the case of a rapidly
expanding bubble investigated in this article, the particle arrival
rate is strongly increased (for more details, see the Supporting Information).

The effectiveness
in trapping particles increases with the bubble
expansion velocity vf and particle radius rp. In fact, considering an expanding bubble
with radius R(t) = vft and a particle (subject solely to
the drag force) at position r with respect to the
center of the bubble, the equation of motion for the particle can
be written as  

If r(0) is the particle position at t = 0, evaluation of the dynamics in the proximity of expanding
bubble
leads to the simple condition for particle trapping,  (see the Supporting Information for more details). Particles below rtrap are reached and trapped, whereas above rtrap, they are accelerated to vf.

Substrate Engineering
The design of the structure was
obtained according to 2D analytical simulations (see Supporting Information for the details) that helped with the
optimization of the mechanism of bubble formation and the control
of its trajectory during the collapse. We found that a combination
of three elements represents an optimal configuration for this purpose:
(i) an out-of-plane plasmonic antenna, which is essential for generating
a bubble detached from the sample surface and thus free to move, (ii)
a docking/deflecting panel, and (iii) a circular area (resembling
a basket) that creates a well-defined target zone where the analytes
are delivered and detected and may represent the active area of a
nanosensor. An SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image of the structure
is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 SEM images of the sample. (a) Overview of several units. (b) High-resolution
image shows the basic nanostructure unit made up of three elements:
(i) the circular target-testing zone (basket), (ii) plasmonic resonant
antenna, and (iii) deflecting panel (board).

One of the innovative features of our configuration is represented
by the presence of the vertical panel, which plays two important roles
in two different temporal steps. In the first step, when the bubble
is generated, the panel prevents the bubble from leaving the surface
by creating a docking point as bubbles have the tendency to stick
to the surfaces of solids due to the surface tension force, Fs. In the second step, when the bubble begins
to collapse, the panel acts as an obstacle that cannot be overcome
by the bubble. Therefore, it moves toward the basket where the available
area is larger (the larger the contact area, the larger the force)
and delivers the particles collected over the course of expansion.

Single- and Multishot Patterns
Extensive tests were
carried out with both fluorescent beads (Fluoresbrite YG carboxylate
microspheres, diameters = 500 and 200 nm) and molecules (green fluorescent
protein, GFP) in order to determine the size range of the effect.
In all cases, the dynamics of the bubbles clearly follows the behavior
previously described. An example is reported in Figure 3, in which a time-lapse sequence of a period
of 2 s is shown: the dynamic of the process (generation and collapse
of the bubble) is clearly visible in the top panel, whereas in the
bottom panel, the formation of the fluorescent spot is shown. The
Supporting Information Video S2 shows the
complete process.

Figure 3 Time-lapse sequence of the generation and collapse of
the bubble.
The time-lapse sequence covers the period of 2.4 s. Images have been
collected by a microscopy setup with a white light (a–d) and
fluorescence illumination (e–h). Picture (e) shows the laser
beam transmitted by the substrate during the laser shot. Imaging the
bubble at the exact maximum expansion is not possible with our equipment.
The dashed circle in the pictures shows the estimated maximum radius
of the bubble, on the order of 30 μm. All images have the same
scale.

The process can be tuned to obtain
bubbles with diameters of up
to 100 μm or more, thus introducing the possibility of collecting
particles from a large volume. On the other hand, the overall time
of the process depends on the bubble size because small bubbles (1–4
μm) collapse in a few seconds, whereas bubbles with diameters
up to 100 μm need time periods on the order of 1–2 min
to collapse.37

The technique is robust
and reliable, and the laser pulses can
be targeted on several structures with a high grade of reproducibility
in order to compute a desired pattern, as shown in Figure 4. The video of the whole process
(Video S3) is included in the Supporting
Information.

Efficiency of the method to perfectly address the final collapsing
site and reconstruct a desired pattern point-by-point.

It should be highlighted that one of the main critical
points of
our tests was the alignment of the laser spot on the antenna because
the overall process strongly depends on the energy transferred from
the laser source to the bubble gases. In our tests, a manual micromanipulator
was used to move the sample below the laser beam; therefore, we observed
some variation in bubble size due to the nonperfect alignment of the
laser with the antenna. To investigate this point, we checked the
reproducibility of the collecting effect by iterated laser pulse trains
without moving the sample. Remarkably, several consecutive pulse trains
can be applied to the same area without noticing any difference in
the effect (Supporting Information Video S2), confirming the solidity of the technique. We noticed that bubbles
could also be generated by using electrical pulses. The latter method
does not suffer the mentioned limitations and may be used as an alternative
to the more expensive laser apparatus.

We tested the proposed
approach on EV exosomes, which are specimens
that are difficult to manage38 and whose
study represents a hot topic in biology,39 as they are carriers of molecules from the parental cells and play
an important role in cancer diagnostics and prognosis. Therefore,
the development of methods for characterizing exosomes and exosome-based
assays is critical. Detection and molecular profiling of exosomes
are technically challenging and often require extensive sample purification
and labeling. We have applied the bubble clustering as a way to concentrate
samples in order to perform Raman spectroscopy on EVs. Raman spectroscopy
is a label-free, powerful technique with high sensitivity to the molecular
species. The main drawback of the Raman spectroscopy is the low cross
section of molecular vibration, resulting in an extremely low signal
from a diluted sample. The combination of the two techniques, bubble
clustering and Raman spectroscopy, thus offers a very powerful method
to overcome the drawbacks of the Raman spectroscopy technique.

EVs were collected from cell culture conditioned medium through
standard procedure based on ultracentrifugation and were dispersed
in phosphate-buffered saline. Raw 264.7 cells release an EV mean diameter
of 62 ± 28 nm (standard deviation), as shown by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) analysis (see Methods).

The substrate with plasmonic antennas was placed on a Petri dish
with a bottom glass window, and 100 μL of vesicle/PBS solution
was dropped over the substrate. Bubbles were generated by 150 ms long
femtosecond laser pulse trains at an average power of 150 mW. After
the delivery process, samples were investigated directly in liquid
using a Raman microspectrometer (Renishaw InVia) equipped with a 60×
Olympus WI objective (numerical aperture NA = 1.0) and a thermoelectrically
cooled CCD as detector (working temperature −60 °C). Spectra
were collected by exciting the system at λ = 632.8 nm with a
He/Ne laser; the laser power was varied between 10 and 20 mW with
integration times of 10 to 20 s.

Figure 5 compares
the results of the Raman measurements performed on the sample before
(black line in the figure) and after (red line in the figure) the
collapse of the bubble. No feature can be recognized in the first
case due to the low concentration of vesicles in solution, which is
one of the reasons for the difficulties in their identification and
detection in physiological media. We would like to note that it was
not possible to detect any Raman signal from the solution in these
conditions, even at increased laser power and integration time. On
the other hand, after the collapse of the bubble, the spectra collected
on the spot left from the aggregated vesicles clearly showed the presence
of several vibrational modes of the EVs, resembling in shape and position
the modes obtained from dried pellets of exosomes.25,40 The comparison with data from the literature has shown the presence
of signals of lipids and proteins, which are mainly related to the
external membrane of the vesicles. As no peaks attributed to the intravesicular
environment have been found, it is possible to suggest that exosomes
are still intact after the concentration treatment. For sake of clarity,
a complete attribution of the peaks is reported with the table in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Raman spectra of exosome
vesicles collected inside the basket before
the bubble generation (black line), after bubble collapse (red line),
and after bubble collapse with the addition of gold nanoparticles
in solution (blue line). In the inset, the laser power and the integration
time for each measure are reported. Below, the table reports the complete
attribution of the peaks, from refs (11) and (41).

A simple but efficient
and expedient method for further improving
the Raman signal amplitude is the addition of gold nanoparticles to
the solution. Indeed, single nanoparticles dispersed in solution do
not offer consistent field amplification useful for surface-enhanced
Raman scattering. However, when accumulated into the basket together
with the vesicles, they provide a strong enhancement of the plasmonic
field. With this aim, we added a small aliquot (20 μL) of a
dispersion of gold nanoparticles to the vesicle solution, and we repeated
the experiment. As shown in Figure 5 (blue line in the figure), the addition of nanoparticles
leads to an increase in the intensity of Raman signals of 8–10
times with respect to the one obtained from vesicles alone.

Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated a method for the controlled
capture and delivery of nanoscale objects by means of gas bubbles
in a liquid environment. The approach exploits a three-dimensional
nanostructured substrate with plasmonic and fluid-dynamic functionalities
able to ensure the formation of a laser-induced cavitation bubble
and its controlled collapse on a targeted site with a sub-10 μm
spatial precision. The use of an NIR femtosecond pulsed source minimizes
the presence of thermal effects, thus allowing the application of
the technique with biological samples where the physiological conditions
should be preserved during analysis. We successfully tested the method
on EVs that are well-known to be hard to handle.

Methods
Isolation
of Extracellular Vesicles from Raw 264.7 cells
Raw 264.7
cells were grown in a culture flask with a complete medium
(DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum + penicillin/streptomycin). At 70%
confluence, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and then incubated with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE), 100 nM in PBS9 at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After a 30 min incubation,
cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with serum-free
culture medium. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was collected and
centrifuged at 4 °C at 300g for 3 min to remove
dead cells and at 2000g for 20 min to remove cell
debris and then ultracentrifuged at 100 000g for 70 min. The EV pellet was resuspended in 100 μL of PBS
and stored at 4 °C until use.

Characterization of Raw
264.7 Derived EV
The size of
the Raw 264.7 derived EV was estimated through DLS and confirmed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For the DLS, EV samples were
resuspended in 300 μL of PBS and analyzed with the Zetasizer
software (Malvern) in the DLS instrument (Malvern). For the TEM analysis,
EVs in PBS were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde
final concentrations. Five microliter drops of fixed EV were adsorbed
at activated carbon-coated copper grids (EMS) for 10 min, stained
with 2% uranyl acetate, and dried by blotting the excess contrasting
solution on filter paper (Whatman). After 3 min of air drying, the
EVs were imaged using a JEOL JEM 1011 TEM equipped with CCD Gatan
Orius camera, at 100 kV. Raw 264.7 cells release EVs of 61.68 ±
27.90 nm, labeled as the mean diameter ± standard deviation (SD),
as shown by DLS analysis (Figure 6).
