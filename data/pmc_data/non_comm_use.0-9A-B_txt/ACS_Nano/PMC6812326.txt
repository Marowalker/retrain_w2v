We present a method for the computational image analysis of high
frequency guided sound waves based upon the measurement of optical
interference fringes, produced at the air interface of a thin film
of liquid. These acoustic actuations induce an affine deformation
of the liquid, creating a lensing effect that can be readily observed
using a simple imaging system. We exploit this effect to measure and
analyze the spatiotemporal behavior of the thin liquid film as the
acoustic wave interacts with it. We also show that, by investigating
the dynamics of the relaxation processes of these deformations when
actuation ceases, we are able to determine the liquid’s viscosity
using just a lens-free imaging system and a simple disposable biochip.
Contrary to all other acoustic-based techniques in rheology, our measurements
do not require monitoring of the wave parameters to obtain quantitative
values for fluid viscosities, for sample volumes as low as 200 pL.
We envisage that the proposed methods could enable high throughput,
chip-based, reagent-free rheological studies within very small samples.

==== Body
The visualization
and characterization
of acoustic waves as they propagate in media have previously been
used to elucidate material properties and gain a deeper understanding
of physical phenomena, including the Raman-Nath effect and Brillouin
scattering.1,2 For example, it has previously been shown
that wave propagation through solid media can reveal valuable information
about the mechanical properties of materials3 such as local stresses, densities, and elastic moduli.4 In the case of the study of the propagation of
acoustic waves in liquids, as they pass either through the bulk or
across boundary interfaces and discontinuities, it is possible to
measure local viscosities, thermal conductivities, and thermoelastic
relaxation processes.5 In this context,
it is already well established that monitoring liquids’ viscosities
(for Newtonian fluids) or viscoelasticities (for non-Newtonian fluids)
is of importance in industry, for example, in the formulation of paint
and processed food as well as in biomedical applications such as measuring
blood viscosity.6

Conventional bulk
rheology measurements are usually performed by
means of large benchtop viscometers and rheometers (often requiring
several milliliters of sample). Recently, microrheology7,8 techniques requiring only a few tens of microliters of sample have
emerged, although many of these protocols require complex sample processing,
including the addition of labels or tracer particles.9 Other methods have also been reported that use nanoliter
sample volumes, although these all require auxiliary equipment such
as benchtop optical lasers,10 microscopes11 (e.g., atomic force microscopy),12 nanoliter droplet dispensers,12 or complex microfluidic channel designs,11 making them cumbersome and unsuitable as portable instruments.

Guided acoustic waves have previously been used in rheological
applications13,14 by measuring their attenuation.
Such mechanical excitations, including those using surface acoustic
waves (SAWs) and Lamb-type waves, have also been used to drive liquid
actuation in microfluidic systems.15−18 In this work, we make use of
the capability of acoustic waves to deform a subnanoliter-scale liquid
volume and monitor the dynamics of its relaxation when the actuation
is turned off (i.e., in contrast with all previous rheological measurement
techniques there are no acoustic waves propagating in the liquid during
the measurement).

Different methods have previously been implemented
for gathering
a better understanding of wave propagation. For instance, Schlieren
imaging and interferometric systems such as laser Doppler vibrometers
(LDVs) have been used for studying acoustic wave propagation and visualization
of acousto-optic interactions,19 where
light is modulated by ultrasonic waves to generate Fraunhofer diffraction
patterns.3 However, optical aberrations
(e.g., in Schlieren visualization) can often result in reduced contrast
and poor fidelity,19 whereas in the case
of LDV strong acousto-optic interaction in condensed medium can result
in large measurement errors, especially when applied to liquids.20 Alternative methods using holography have also
been used to visualize ∼1 MHz waves but these require the addition
of reagents, acting as reporter particles to generate the holograms.21 Recently, a fast but low-resolution method for
visualizing acoustic beams was proposed,22 where an excited region within a thin liquid layer produced an optical
pattern because of the local deformation of the liquid film.

Here, we present a simple optical method for imaging small amplitude
guided waves of wavelength λ in plates coated by a thin fluid
layer of thickness 2a (with 2a ≪
λ) and demonstrate its application for measuring the viscosity
of liquid samples with subnanoliter volumes, without monitoring wave
parameters. Using computational imaging23,24 of these guided
waves at ultrasonic frequencies (∼10 MHz), we demonstrate their
visualization over a wide field-of-view (∼30 mm2) within a lens-free system. The method was validated by a direct
visualization of Lamb-type waves and is supported by analytical and
numerical models.

In our configuration, the liquid–air
interface was first
deformed using acoustic actuation and the relaxation dynamics of the
deformation was monitored, once the acoustic excitation was switched
off. As stated, contrary to all previous techniques, no acoustic wave
is propagating when the measurement is carried out. We corroborate
this by measuring the rheological properties of aqueous mixtures of
glycerol and polyethylene glycol, Mr =
400 (PEG400). We demonstrated the ability of the technique to investigate
nanoliter-scale volumes of liquids (where other approaches require
orders of magnitude larger sample volumes). Our approach does not
require the addition of reagents or labels and is contactless (these
being “ideal” requirements in biological studies). We
envisage that in the future the device can not only be integrated
with microfluidics and lab-on-chip platforms for high-throughput characterization
of bioliquids but could also be used for other applications such as
inspection of materials properties (e.g., industrial wafer stress-testing
or rapidly investigating wafer defects by exploring deformations in
a thin film of liquid).

Results and Discussion
Imaging System
The imaging system comprised a three-dimensional
(3D) printed housing to hold an array of green light-emitting diodes
(LED) that can be selectively illuminated and controlled using a microcontroller.
The imaging system also included an optical band-pass filter (532
nm), a 3D printed sample holder to align a disposable waveguide with
the piezoelectric interdigitated transducer (IDT) and a complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor with a pixel pitch of 1.67
μm, Figure 1.

printed, acoustic computational imaging system.
(a) The lens-free computational imaging system integrated with an
ultrasonic transducer. (b) The schematic of the device. The device
contains 20 LEDs (1) with a selectable switch using an onboard microcontroller.
The light from each LED was coupled into an optical fiber (2) that
passes through a narrow band filter (3). The sample, illuminated from
the bottom, was placed on the lens-free microscope using a detachable
tray containing the SAW IDT (4). The CMOS imager (5) was placed directly
on top of the sample (∼1 mm high) to record the transmitted
light from the sample.

The 20 fiber-coupled
LED array was used to illuminate the sample
from below,25 as shown in Figure 1. It was designed to generate
a set of subpixel shifted images, which were then used to digitally
synthesize images with subpixel resolution.26−28 The disposable
biochip was coupled to the IDT using a thin layer of polyethylene
glycol (PEG 400) which we found to be a stable coupling agent. The
transmitted light was recorded by the CMOS sensor, which was placed
at ∼1 mm distance from the sample, so that the sample field-of-view
was equal to the active area of the CMOS imager. A Rayleigh wave,
generated on the lithium niobate (LiNbO3) transducer, coupled
into the platelike glass biochip, with finite dimensions, creating
a standing Lamb-type wave, Figure 2.

Figure 2 A schematic of an IDT on a lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
wafer. The pitch of the IDT was the same as the wavelength (λSAW) of the Rayleigh wave. The Rayleigh wave couples into disposable
(glass) biochip as a Lamb-type wave. The IDT and the disposable biochip
are coupled using a thin layer of PEG400.

This standing wave induced an affine deformation of the thin liquid
layer on the substrate of thickness 2h (with 2a ≪ 2h), which was detected using
the CMOS image sensor to measure the bright and dark fringes generated
by the distortion of the optical wavefronts while passing though the
liquid–air interface, Figure 3.

Figure 3 Lamb-type wave imaging. (a) An image of the Lamb-type
wave in a
thin film of glycerol (60% w/w in water) on a glass superstrate actuated
by a 9.71 MHz SAW transducer. The SAW beam couples into the superstrate
as a Lamb wave and reflects back from the glass–air boundary
to create a standing wave in the liquid. The red-dotted box shows
the cartoon of the underlying principle. At the nodes of the standing
wave, the surface displacement was minimum, whereas at the antinodes
the surface displacement was maximum creating a lens-like profile
in the liquid. The incident light was defocused and focused respectively
and was collected at the CMOS sensor in the form of dark and bright
fringes allowing imaging of the wave. (b) Comparison between an SEM
image and a lens-free image of a UV curable polymer used to create
permanent wave patterns. Full frames of the images are available in Supporting Information Video S1.

We investigated how the liquid layer deformation, at its
maximum
at the standing wave antinodes and at its minimum at the standing
wave nodes, could be used to create nanolensing effects. The induced
deformation of the liquid’s surface generates an optical profile
that can be modeled to a first approximation as a sinusoidal function,
allowing an estimation of the deformation height using a ray-tracing
model (calculated as about 150 nm, Figure 4). As a result, the light passing through
the liquid–air interface can be both focused (bright fringes)
and defocused (dark fringes), Figure 4b,c.

Figure 4 Liquid deformations and optical elements. (a) Ray-tracing
model
geometry for the lens-free imaging system. The light rays from a partially
coherent light source pass through a liquid layer of thickness 2a under a sinusoidal corrugation of the liquid surface.
The light refracts as it passes through different media, that is,
the liquid (mineral oil), glass, and air before being detected by
the CMOS sensor. The corrugation height of the liquid increases with
the excitation amplitude. (b) Modeled liquid deformation for mineral
oil sample. The dark area represents the pressure nodes in the glass
plate where the liquid deformation was minimum, whereas the bright
regions represents the antinodes. (c) Corresponding image for experimental
measurement. The modeling shows that the corrugation height is 0.154
μm.

The corrugation height of the
deformations in the SAW actuation
of the liquid surface at the interface depends upon the frequency
and amplitude of the standing wave as well as on the liquid’s
physical properties.29−32 Our lens-free optical imaging configuration has unit-magnification.33 To quantitatively analyze the intensity of the
fringes’ patterns, we developed a graphic user interface that
allowed us to load a sequence of images (or a video) to analyze selected
regions of interest, frame by frame. The wavelength of the periodic
deformation of the liquid was calculated using a fast Fourier transform
(FFT) algorithm. The temporal response of the deformation was calculated
by implementing a dynamic spline fitting algorithm as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Graphical user interface
(GUI). (a) The GUI to measure the wavelength
and analyze the transient response. The GUI shows the frame-by-frame
preview of the video and allows the user to select the appropriate
frame range for further analysis. (b) Process flow of the image processing
algorithm. For measuring the phase velocity, a 1D FFT is applied to
the region of interest and the output is shown in the GUI. For transient
analysis, the region of interest (user drawn lines) is filtered to
remove background noise and the normalized pixel intensity is computed.
The maximum and minimum intensity values were calculated by fitting
a spline curve and the temporal response was plotted in the GUI. Upon
selecting a frame, reporting lines were added to analyze multiple
regions. The display outputs are (bottom left) the calculated wavelength,
(bottom center) the temporal behavior of the image brightness (i.e.,
relaxation of the antinode) as the SAW is switched off, and (bottom
right) the recovery of the dark regions (i.e., the nodes). The temporal
response was calculated by implementing a dynamic spline-fitting algorithm.

The results from the lens-free imaging system were
validated by
creating a steady-state standing acoustic sinusoidal wave pattern
by ultraviolet (UV) illumination of a photocurable polymer. This technique
enabled us to freeze the induced deformation of the polymer thin layer,
showing the spatial periodicity of the elastic waves. This induced
structure was visualized by both the lens-free imaging system and
a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Figure 3b. From these images, we estimated the steady-state
wavelength at an excitation of 9.71 MHz to be 375 μm in the
lens-free image validated by the SEM image, respectively. In the case
of liquid films, the effectiveness of the lens-free imaging system
was further corroborated using laser Doppler vibrometry. For example,
when measuring phase velocity there is no significant difference between
the vibrometer (2534.9 ± 1.8 m/s), the lens-free system (2503.7
± 21.6 m/s) and the analytical value (2525.9 m/s).

Theoretical
Analysis
We considered the analysis of
small amplitude ultrasonic guided waves (with a wavenumber k = 2πf/c, where f is the frequency, c is the guided wave
phase velocity) propagating in a nonviscous liquid–solid bilayer.
The viscosity of the liquid was disregarded because its effect on
the phase velocity of Lamb waves was negligible compared to that on
their attenuation.34 The liquid layer (thickness,
2a) was characterized using the ultrasonic wave phase
velocity in the liquid, cF, and the volumetric
mass density, ρF. The elastic solid layer (thickness,
2h) and volumetric mass density ρ enables propagation
of longitudinal and transversal ultrasonic waves with velocities cL and cT, respectively.
The guided waves in the liquid–solid bilayer were analyzed
using the following dispersion equation35 1  where 2   3  

Equations 2 and 3 represent the
dispersion relations for the antisymmetric and symmetric guided modes
(Lamb-type wave) in the free solid plate. The remaining coefficients
are given by 4   5   6   7  where ω = 4fh/cT and ξ = 4fh/c.

In absence of a liquid layer (i.e., when
its thickness is 0), eq 1 enabled us to calculate
the dispersion curves of the Lamb waves in the free solid plate, Figure 6 (model parameters
are listed in Table S1). A cutoff frequency
of the higher order Lamb wave mode A1 was at 11.7 MHz. Numerical results
showed that only the fundamental Lamb wave modes A0 and S0 can exist
in the free solid plate below such frequency. The antisymmetric excitation
source ensures that the antisymmetric mode A0 is dominant in the thin
glass plate. When the plate was coated by a thin liquid film, the
Lamb waves did not couple into the coating liquid (as the phase velocity
changes were negligible) but the waves were attenuated by the viscosity
of the liquid.34 We measured the thickness
of the liquid layer at about 7 μm with optical microscopy. Our
analysis showed that in the cases of thin layers (i.e., 2a < 15 μm), the wavelength of the guided wave of A0 decreases
from λ = 269.1 μm to λ = 264.3 μm. Given the
finite resolution of the CMOS sensor, we would not be able to detect
phase velocity changes of the guided wave for variations of the liquid
film thickness below 5 μm (Figure 6b). Finally, the theoretical framework introduced
above indicated that small volumes of liquid (subnanoliters), such
as those used in this work, do not influence the wave propagation,
confirming the analytical results.

Figure 6 (a) Lamb wave dispersion curves in a glass
(biochip) plate of 145
μm thickness, where the blue and red colors indicate antisymmetric
and symmetric Lamb wave modes, respectively. The green circle marks
the experimentally excited A0 Lamb wave mode at 9.71
MHz. (b) Dispersion of antisymmetric guided wave mode versus liquid
thickness 2a at 9.71 MHz, where blue color shows
the analytical result (eq 1). The CMOS sensor resolution rCMOS shows
that the liquid thickness variations 2Δa <
5 μm can be neglected in the measurement system.

We also show that guided waves with a longer wavelength than
the
liquid thickness (i.e., λ ≫ 2a) do not
couple into the liquid from the glass plate. Because the wave amplitude
is much smaller than the liquid thickness (2a), any
possible nonlinear effects such as acoustic streaming, cavitation,
jetting, and nebulization of the liquid are either negligible or not
possible.

Transient Response and Rheological Application
Investigations
of dynamics of standing waves at the liquid–air interface can
be dated to the pioneering studies of Faraday in 1831,36 where the formation of standing waves on the
free surface of a liquid, subjected to vertical sinusoidal oscillation,
was reported. Since then, several attempts have been made37−40 to provide a general solution by exploring increasingly complex
systems, including inviscid liquids (where the damping effects are
neglected),41 simple Newtonian liquids42 (with a time-invariant viscosity), and generic
viscoelastic liquids32 (with a frequency-dependent
viscosity). In the case of Newtonian liquids, the general analytical
approach is often based on solving a Mathieu equation, which describes
the forcing of a simple harmonic oscillator by periodic variation
of its proper frequency.43 The displacement x(t) of a harmonic oscillator can be described
by31 8   9  where μ is the damping
rate, ε is the amplitude of the force at frequency ω,
and t is the time. An analysis of the Mathieu equation
shows that the ε – ω parameter plane is divided
into regions where the displacement x(t) goes to zero at long times (assuming finite damping), and regions
(known as resonance tongues) where it grows exponentially without
bound.31

A thin liquid film was deposited
onto the biochip and wide area imaging of Lamb-type waves was performed.
The liquid, placed on such a solid substrate, could be assumed to
be subjected to an affine sinusoidal deformation, whose amplitude
(∼0.154 μm) was much smaller than the liquid thickness
(∼7 μm), with the liquid–air interface mirroring
the deformation induced by the guided wave at the solid–liquid
interface, as shown in Figure 4. Because the liquid thickness was much smaller than the guided
wave’s wavelength and as the acoustic wave did not couple into
the liquid, it follows that under continuous ultrasonic excitation
the deformation of the liquid’s surface reached a steady-state
amplitude.

Upon switching the ultrasonic actuation off, the
acoustic wave
energy at the solid–liquid boundary dissipated almost instantaneously
(that is, ∼μs), while the deformation of the liquid at
the liquid–air interface relaxed at a much slower rate (i.e.,
over a few seconds). As stated, the initial deformation (at the point
where the acoustic actuation is turned off) mirrored the Lamb-type
wave deformations of the surface, as a single-mode pattern. The relaxation
processes were analyzed as a relaxation phenomena of a single-mode
small instability perturbing an overdamped harmonic oscillator.43−45 For such a system, we note that the additional approximation, neglecting
the acceleration due to gravity, enables eq 8 to be solved to give a wave amplitude (Aκ(t))
that is expected to decrease exponentially 10  with decay rate: 11  where ν is the kinetic
viscosity of the liquid, σ is the liquid–air surface
tension, and κ is the wavelength of the initial instability.46

The transient relaxation responses of
different water–glycerol
mixtures (differing by less than 10% in surface tension, but orders
of magnitude in viscosity), as well as PEG400-water mixtures, were
investigated when the excitation of the elastic wave was removed, Figure 7. The results show
that the attenuation rate was faster and the overall relaxation time
was shorter for more viscous liquids (inset). The measurements agreed
with conventional bulk rheology values, Figure S2. When subjected to SAWs, highly viscous liquids (e.g., 100%
glycerol) undergo rapid heating. Figure S3 shows the changes in viscosity induced by the heat generated after
5 s SAW actuation, consistent with results reported by Zha et al.47 and Shilton et al.48Figure S4 also provides an example of
infrared images used to evaluate the temperature of the films. The
results demonstrate that SAW-induced heating only affects significantly
the highest viscosity used. When the viscosity of 100% glycerol was
adjusted to that of the measured temperature of 50 °C (triangle
in the inset), the measured relaxation time agreed well with the theoretical
prediction. Hence, there is an opportunity to use this lens-free imaging
system as a low-cost chip-based tool for measuring liquids viscosities.
The advantage of requiring only subnanoliters sample volume cannot
be underestimated for high value products, such as those used in biological
experimentation.

Figure 7 Viscosity measurements. The transient response upon cessation
of
acoustic actuation of the induced affine deformation of the liquid-air
interface of various glycerol−water (triangles) and PEG400−water
(circles) mixtures. Measurements were performed as described in Figure 5. The inset shows
the existence of an inverse proportionality between the measured time
of relaxation and the fluids’ viscosity.

Finally, we highlight that the deviation from this inverse proportionality
of the relaxation time for 100% glycerol (η = 612 cP) is due
to the elastic wave heating effects (Figure 7) that have been observed for highly viscous
liquids (i.e., pure glycerol).47,48 For low viscous liquids
(i.e., for η ≤ 109 cP) the proposed device does not require
temperature monitoring. Nonetheless, we anticipate that future versions
of the device will include temperature control capability.

Conclusions
We present a method to visualize and quantitatively measure the
wavelengths of guided acoustic waves using a wide field-of-view lens-free
imaging system. We extend this capability to characterize beam formation
and attenuation and subsequently to study the rheological properties
of thin (Newtonian) liquid layers. Glycerol–water and PEG–water
mixtures having different viscosities showed excellent agreement between
theoretical predictions and experimental results, enabling us to establish
a relationship between the transient response of the liquid–air
interface and the kinematic viscosity of such liquids.

The use
of ultrasmall liquid sample volumes on disposable biochips
makes this technique particularly attractive for applications where
rare or high value biological liquids are employed; for example, medical
diagnostics or in a quality control process of pharmaceuticals. This
approach could also be readily extended to non-Newtonian liquids,
demonstrating the applicability of this technique in rheology.

Experimental Section
SAW Device Fabrication
Interdigitated transducers (IDT)
with 40 electrode pairs (10 nm Ti, 100 nm Au) were patterned on a
128°Y-cut X-propagating LiNbO3 wafer of 1 mm thickness (Roditi, U.K.) using standard photolithography
techniques as described previously.49 Their
width and pitch were designed using the simple wavelength relationship: f = c/λ and λ = D, where f is the frequency, c is
the wave propagation velocity of LiNbO3 and D is the pitch.50 For 9.71 MHz, λ
was 410 μm. The sound propagation velocity in LiNbO3 was 3992 m/s and the IDT aperture was 20 mm. The IDTs also showed
further harmonics at 18.63 and 20.41 MHz, as measured using the S11-parameter from a network analyzer (E5701C ENA, Agilent Technologies).

Lens-Free Computational Imaging
The lens-free microscope
was developed and implemented using 3D printed components, as shown
in Figure 1, and consisted
of an illumination module, an optical band-pass filter, a sample holder
attached to the SAW device and a 10 mega pixel CMOS imager (UI-1492LE-M,
Imaging Development Systems). The illumination module consisted of
20 fiber coupled LEDs that were individually controlled using a microcontroller.51 Measurements were carried out using only one
LED (although the presence of multiple LEDs facilitates a pixel super-resolution
imaging capability27,28). Imaging with a resolution below
the pixel size in the future could enable studying acoustic waves
at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths).

A partially coherent
light source (a fiber coupled LED, with a center wavelength of ∼532
nm) was used to irradiate the sample. The interference between the
directly transmitted and the scattered light from the sample was recorded
at the CMOS imager as an inline hologram.52 The vertical distance between the sample and the CMOS detector plane
was ∼1 mm, such that the sample field-of-view was equal to
the active area of the CMOS imager. These inline holograms could be
used directly for analysis of the sample or, when spatial resolution
is of importance, they can be rapidly reconstructed by digitally back-propagating
the hologram to the object plane or by using iterative phase-recovery
methods.24,53 Image reconstruction and elimination of
twin-image related artifacts in the final holographic image were crucial
in identifying smaller objects (∼<5 μm), however it
was not necessary for the detection of larger spatial features of
interest as presented here. Further details of this on-chip lens-free
holographic imaging system can be found in the reported work.28

Samples were prepared by spin-coating
the liquid of interest on
the glass biochip (Fisher Finest Premium 12-548A, Fisher Scientific).
The disposable glass biochips were thoroughly cleaned in acetone (67-64-1,
Fisher) overnight and then washed with ethanol (10646134, Acros Organics)
and deionized water (7732-18-5, Sigma-Aldrich). After drying, the
biochips were plasma-treated (PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma) to remove any
organic residuals and the sample was spin coated at 12 000
rpm for 60 s (WS650HZB, Laurell). The biochips were then placed on
the sample holder and coupled to the SAW device using PEG400 (25322-68-3,
Sigma-Aldrich). The thin coupling film had a calculated volume of
about 300 nL. The technique could also be implemented directly on
the piezoelectric wafer used as a waveguide when cost and contamination
issues are not critical to the target application. Wide area imaging
of Lamb-type waves was performed, illuminated from below, with the
transmitted light recorded using a CMOS imager chip.

Upon switching
the ultrasonic actuation off, the acoustic wave
energy at the solid–liquid boundary dissipated almost instantaneously,
whereas the deformation of the liquid at the liquid–air interface
relaxes at a much slower rate (over a few seconds). Rheological characterization
required a volume whose geometry was defined by one acoustic wavelength
(∼162 μm, x), averaged over 10 pixels
on the CMOS sensor (∼16.7 μm, y), with
a thickness (z) of ∼7 μm (i.e., <200
pL). To ensure samples did not evaporate, measurements were performed
in a controlled humidified environment. Throughout all experiments,
sample temperature was externally monitored using a thermal imager
(C2, FLIR).

In all cases, the illumination module was controlled
using a LABVIEW
program. The image analysis was performed using a laptop (Lenovo Y480
with an Intel Core i7-3610QM microprocessor).

Physical Characterization
Physical characterization
experiments were performed as follows: The liquid sample thickness
was measured on biochips by adding 20 μM fluorescein dye, and
a z-stack was obtained on a confocal microscope (LSM
510 Meta, Zeiss). Ultrasonic characterization was performed either
on the LiNbO3 wafer as a Rayleigh wave, or on the glass
biochip as a Lamb-type wave using a LDV (UHF-120, Polytec GmbH). An
electrical network analyzer (E5701C ENA, Agilent Technologies) was
used for the ultrasonic frequency characterization of the LiNbO3 transducer. Ultrasonic waves “set” in cured
polymer as show in Figure 3 were measured using a scanning electron microscope (Nova
600 SEM/FIB System).
