We report the self-assembly
of a biodegradable platinum nanoparticle-loaded
stomatocyte nanomotor containing both PEG-b-PCL and
PEG-b-PS as a potential candidate for anticancer
drug delivery. Well-defined stomatocyte structures could be formed
even after incorporation of 50% PEG-b-PCL polymer.
Demixing of the two polymers was expected at high percentage of semicrystalline
poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), resulting in PCL domain formation
onto the membrane due to different properties of two polymers. The
biodegradable motor system was further shown to move directionally
with speeds up to 39 μm/s by converting chemical fuel, hydrogen
peroxide, into mechanical motion as well as rapidly delivering the
drug to the targeted cancer cell. Uptake by cancer cells and fast
doxorubicin drug release was demonstrated during the degradation of
the motor system. Such biodegradable nanomotors provide a convenient
and efficient platform for the delivery and controlled release of
therapeutic drugs.

Inspired
by fascinating molecular
motors and movable organisms, scientists have used both top-down and
bottom-up strategies to fabricate self-propelled micro- and nanomotors
over the past decade.1−9 Until now, many examples of different types of motors (micro- and
nanotubes,10−12 wires,13,14 helices,15,16 rods,17−19 Janus motors20−23 and self-assembled polymeric motors24−28) have been developed. These artificial motors are capable of converting
chemical or external energy into autonomous movement and possess various
potential applications such as environmental remediation, sensing,
and drug delivery.29−34 Compared to normal drug delivery systems (lacking self-driving force),
the most important advantage of a micro- and nanomotor system is independent
impetus, which is necessary for tissue penetration and cellular barriers.34,35 For drug delivery applications, micro- and nanomotor systems should
be both biocompatible and biodegradable.36,37 However, the design of current motor systems reported so far is
mostly based on heavy metal systems, which do not provide a suitable
soft interface for biological systems.14,38

While
several examples of biocompatible motors have already been
reported,21,39,40 only a few
that progress toward biodegradable motor systems have been reported
until now.41−45 For degradable zinc (Zn)/magnesium (Mg)-based micromotors, acid-powered
propulsion can be achieved only in the gastrointestinal tract. The
main degradation products were essential nutrients in human bodies.46,47 A protein-based biodegradable multilayer microtubular motor combined
with drug-loaded gelatin hydrogel has also been reported recently.42 However, the size of the Zn/Mg or protein-based
motor is micron sized, which is far away from potential clinical applications
that target an intravenous route. Furthermore, the clearance of these
micrometer motors will be quite fast due to the lack of poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) shells. In general, the introduction of PEG shells,
called PEGylation, onto the surface of micro- and nanocarriers can
prolong their circulation in vivo by avoiding phagocytosis
from macrophages.48 Hence, the development
of nanometer-scale biodegradable motors capable of stealth transport
and drug release remains challenging.

In our previous work,
a polymeric stomatocyte nanomotor made of
soft self-assembled block copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol)-b-polystyrene (PEG-b-PS) was demonstrated
not only to move in the presence of hydrogen peroxide49 and alternative fuels50,51 but also to
show chemotaxis behavior upon hydrogen peroxide gradients.24 Unlike the traditional motor systems, both water-soluble
and water-insoluble drugs can be loaded due to the presence of the
bilayer structure.52 However, as a major
component, glassy PS is unfortunately a non-biodegradable and non-biocompatible
polymer, which is not suitable for further biomedical applications.
This fully bottom-up nanomotor system would be more versatile if a
biodegradable polymer was used to build the structure of the stomatocyte.

Here, we demonstrate successful design and fabrication of a biodegradable
self-assembled nanomotor system for drug delivery based on a mixture
of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PEG-b-PCL) and well-documented vesicle former PEG-b-PS, as illustrated in Figure 1. Biodegradable polymer PCL is one of the
most commonly used candidates and was already approved by the FDA
for medical applications.53,54 Stomatocyte bowl-shape
morphology was obtained under osmotic folding of polymersomes and
was observed even when the percentage of PEG-b-PCL
was increased to 50% (w/w, 67% in mol ratio). The hydrophilic polymer
PEG in our system can prolong the circulation time in vivo. Furthermore, water-soluble anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was
loaded into the lumen of the structure, and platinum nanoparticles
(PtNPs, as model catalyst) were encapsulated in the cavity of stomatocyte
as the engine. The self-assembled nanomotors show autonomous motion
under low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Due to the different
structural properties of PCL, which is a semicrystalline polymer,
and PS, a glassy polymer, it was anticipated that upon mixing the
PCL would demix and form domains in the self-assembled bilayer when
a high percentage of PCL was blended into the membrane of stomatocytes.
Large pores would be formed onto the stomatocyte surface during the
degradation of PCL, which could lead to sustained drug release. After
uptake by tumor cells, the biodegradable stomatocyte nanomotor could
subsequently release the loaded cargo, in this case, Dox in tumor
cells (HeLa cells). According to the literature, tumor cells can produce
hydrogen peroxide at a rate of up to 0.5 nmol per 104 cells
per hour.55 Therefore, such a design enables
our drug-loaded nanomotor system to actively move toward tumor cells,
facilitate uptake, release the drug, and kill the tumor cells.

Results and Discussion
Self-Assembly of Hybrid Polymersome or Stomatocyte
A hybrid polymersome or stomatocyte was prepared by mixing the
biodegradable
polymer PEG-b-PCL with the template polymer PEG-b-PS (0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, 90/10, and 100/0, w/w)
by a solvent switch method and subsequent dialysis to induce osmotic
shock and folding of the membrane into it.56,57 Polymers with different ratios were dissolved in organic solvent
(THF/dioxane = 4:1, v/v), and Milli-Q water was then slowly added
into the polymer solution at a rate of 1 mL/h. After vigorous dialysis
to remove the organic solvent, hybrid polymeric vesicles with different
PCL percentages were obtained. No significant cloud point was observed
in the sample with 100% PCL. This indicates no vesicle formation,
which was also confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.
Thirty nanometer sized nanoparticles were formed instead. All self-assembled
structures showed narrow polydispersity (Supplementary Table 1) until the PCL percentage was increased up to 90%.
In the 90% PCL sample, a small population of 30 nm sized nanoparticles
was observed in DLS intensity data (Supplementary Figure 1), whereas the number size distribution DLS showed
a much larger percentage of 30 nm nanoparticles (Supplementary Figure 2). This suggested high demixing between
PEG-b-PS and PEG-b-PCL polymers
and the assembly of the PEG-b-PCL into micelles.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further used to visualize
the morphology of these samples (Figure 2a–f). Vesicles containing PEG-b-PCL in less than 75% can form well-defined stomatocyte
structures. Clear bilayer structure was observed with a thickness
around 25 nm. Due to the bilayer structure, the hydrophilic drug Dox
was loaded in the water lumen of vesicles during the self-assembly.
Fluorescent Dox was observed in the confocal image as red dot indicating
a successful drug encapsulation (Supplementary Figure 3).

Formation of PCL Domains
In order
to confirm the mixing
and the presence of PCL in the membrane structure, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to map certain elements on the vesicles.
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was coupled onto the PEG-b-PCL polymer to introduce S for visualization. Significant
S enrichment was observed for the FITC-labeled vesicles (mixed with
50% PEG-b-PCL-FITC) compared to normal vesicles without
FITC labeling (mixed with 50% PEG-b-PCL) (Figure 2g,h). Interestingly,
the signal of S showed domain formation on the structure of the hybrid
vesicle rather than homogeneous distribution over the whole membrane.
EDX line scans using STEM mode across the vesicles also revealed that
S was not evenly distributed on the membrane structure (Supplementary Figure 4). Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) was further used to confirm the demixing behavior
of hybrid stomatocytes. The
samples with different percentages of PCL blending (0, 25, 50, 75,
90, and 100% PCL) were prepared and freeze-dried for DSC measurements.
From the DSC spectrum (Supplementary Figure 6), two polymers mixed well in the sample of the hybrid stomatocyte
with 25% PCL blending due to a negligible signal from semicrystalline
PCL. When the PCL percentage increased to 50%, a significant signal
of PCL was observed, which suggests PCL demixing with PS, indicating
PCL domain formation.

Because the main component of the hybrid
stomatocytes (PEG-b-PCL polymer) is biodegradable,
our nanomotor systems can easily be degraded by either acid or lipases.
Stomatocytes with 50% PCL were used to investigate the acid-induced
degradation as well-defined stomatocyte structures were still formed
at this high percentage. Hybrid stomatocytes with 50% PCL were incubated
with citric acid/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 1), and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to image the morphology
changing before and after acidic treatment. From the SEM image and
TEM image (inset of Figure 3a) shown in Figure 3a, smooth bowl-shaped stomatocytes with narrow openings were
observed before treatment. However, after incubation with acidic buffer,
the PCL units from the stomatocyte started to degrade (Figure 3b). Large pores in the membrane
of the stomatocyte and even collapsed structures were formed. This
also indicates that a high percentage of PEG-b-PCL
polymer induces domain formation onto the membrane, which is responsible
for the observation of the large pores by SEM after acid treatment.
This would not be possible if PEG-b-PCL is homogeneously
mixed with PEG-b-PS in the membrane.58 When loaded with drug, the drug can be released in a controlled
manner once PCL starts to degrade at low pH. This feature makes these
motors attractive for practical drug delivery and release in the human
body.

acidic degradation (inset is a TEM image of a single stomatocyte with
small opening). (b) SEM images of stomatocytes with 50% PEG-b-PCL after acidic degradation. (c) Release of Dox from
a stomatocyte with different percentages of PCL at different pH. All
scale bars are 400 nm.

In order to investigate the release characteristics of our
self-assembled
system, release experiments in vitro from stomatocyte
nanomotors were performed at room temperature in two types of medium,
namely, acidic buffer (citric acid/Na2HPO4,
pH 5) and neutral buffer (citric acid/Na2HPO4, pH 7) (Figure 3c).
The release percentage of stomatocyte nanomotors with 50% PCL was
higher than that of samples without PCL or with only 25% PCL in both
acidic and neutral conditions. Moreover, for stomatocyte nanomotors
without PCL blending, there was almost no release of Dox in both buffers
at different pH. Hybrid nanomotors cumulatively release 20% Dox in
acidic buffer for 48 h, which was significantly higher than the 5%
release in buffer at pH 7 in the same time frame. Interestingly, the
release curve of stomatocytes with 25% PCL and 50% PCL seemed to be
quite linear, probably because of pore formation after acidic treatment.
From SEM images after acidic incubation (Figure 3a,b), pores on the structure of the hybrid
stomatocyte and collapsed structures were observed, which also explains
the linear release profiles of Dox.

Movement Analysis and Cell
Uptake
PEG-b-PS and PEG-b-PCL at different ratios were dissolved
in THF and dioxane (4:1, v/v), and Milli-Q water was added at a rate
of 1 mL/h followed by PtNP solution. After dialysis to remove the
organic solvent, hybrid stomatocyte nanomotors with different PCL
percentages were obtained (the structure of nanomotors can be seen
in Supplementary Figure 7). Nanosight NS500
was used to investigate the motion behavior of these hybrid stomatocyte
nanomotors in the presence of hydrogen peroxide solution. The movement
was recorded for 90 s, and each second contained 30 frames. Nanoparticle-tracking
analysis was used to track in real-time the movement of the stomatocyte
motors. A 4.98 mM hydrogen peroxide solution was used for the motion
analysis. An appropriate concentration of motor solution (finally
concentration is 108 particles/mL) was added, and the resulting
solution was measured at physiological temperature of 37 °C.
Calculated mean-square displacements (MSDs) of the hybrid nanomotors
in the presence of hydrogen peroxide showed directional movement compared
to that of the stomatocytes without fuel. Fitting of the MSDs allows
for calculation of the velocity of the nanomotors by using the self-diffusiophoretic
model proposed by Golestanian and co-workers.59 The velocity of hybrid stomatocyte nanomotors in the presence of
fuel (Figure 4a) at
37 °C showed no significant difference compared to that of normal
nanomotors without PCL blending, which was also comparable with our
previous study. The velocity of the stomatocyte nanomotor with 0,
25, and 50% PCL was around 39 μm/s. Brownian motion and a typical
linear MSD curve was observed when studying the movement of hybrid
nanomotors without hydrogen peroxide fuel. In addition, representative
tracking trajectories of the hybrid nanomotors with and without fuel
are presented in Figure 4b. As predicted, the trajectory of the hybrid nanomotors without
fuel followed the random walk typical of a Brownian motion and did
not show any directionality or increase in movement. For the mechanism
of motion, self-diffusiophoresis and bubble propulsion were possible
mechanisms in our system. In our previous studies,27 decreased speed and MSDs were observed in PBS compared
to Milli-Q water, indicating a self-diffusiophoresis mechanism. However,
speed and MSDs in PBS were still higher than those of motors without
hydrogen peroxide fuel (Brownian motion), which also indicated the
possible existence of a bubble propulsion mechanism. After degradation
of the PCL in acidic conditions, the motion behavior of a biodegradable
hybrid stomatocyte nanomotor was studied. Almost Brownian motion was
observed, indicating that the degradation of PCL affects the motion
behavior (Supplementary Figure 8). For
our nanomotor design, the narrow opening of the stomatocyte serves
as the outlet for the formed oxygen, and it is crucial for the propulsion
of the nanomotor. After PCL degradation, large pores or even collapsed
structures are formed on the membrane of the stomatocyte nanomotor.
This results in complete collapse of the structure or of the outlet
into multiple pores, leading to almost complete disruption of the
active motion toward Brownian motion.

of H2O2 (final concentration was 4.98 mM) at

NS500. Velocities were calculated. Directional motion was fitted using
the equation (4D)Δt + (v2)(Δt2). (b)
Representative tracking trajectories of the hybrid stomatocyte nanomotor.

HeLa cells were used to investigate
cell internalization and subsequent
release behavior of hybrid stomatocyte nanomotors. The cells were
incubated with Dox-loaded nanomotors together with hydrogen peroxide.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy images (Figure 5) clearly show that both a normal stomatocyte
nanomotor and a hybrid stomatocyte nanomotor were taken up by the
HeLa cells (red fluorescence comes from Dox). In the case of a biodegradable
hybrid stomatocyte nanomotor, the fluorescence of Dox diffused over
the cell, indicating the release of drugs from vesicles into the cell
due to degradation (see the cross section in Figure 5d). However, stomatocytes without PCL still
showed a dot-like fluorescent signal (see the cross section in Figure 5b), which meant no
drug release occurred. In addition, cell uptake experiments were also
performed without hydrogen peroxide. Similar results are shown in Supplementary Figure 9. To further test the biodegradability
of our nanomotor, stomatocytes loaded with near-infrared fluorescent
cyanine dye DiR were injected in vivo. The fluorescence
signal was no longer detectable at day 7 after injection, compared
to the strong signal at day 3, suggesting that the stomatocytes were
degraded in the mouse (Supplementary Figure 10).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated the design of a hybrid stomatocyte
nanomotor based on biodegradable PCL for drug delivery. The bilayer
membrane structure of motors allows for efficient loading of both
hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Due to a high percentage of PCL
blending, PCL domains were formed on the surface of the nanomotors.
The system is in effect able to locally sense the environment, in
this case pH. During the degradation, pores and collapse are formed,
leading to controlled release of the anticancer drug under acidic
conditions in vitro. In addition, our nanomotor can
also be taken up by HeLa cells and subsequently release its cargo
to kill them. Finally, in vivo data show the biodegradability
of the nanomotor system. Thus, we envision that our nanomotor system
has huge potential for drug delivery and controlled released in vivo.

Methods
Self-Assembly
of Stomatocytes or Hybrid Stomatocytes
Ten milligrams of
polymer with different ratios between PEG-b-PS and
PEG-b-PCL was fully dissolved
in a 1 mL mixture of THF/dioxane (4:1, v/v). One milliliter of Milli-Q
water was slowly added into the solution by a syringe pump at a rate
of 1 mL/h. After vigorous dialysis for at least 48 h, stomatocytes
and hybrid stomatocytes with different percentages of PCL were obtained.

Self-Assembly of PtNP-Loaded Stomatocyte or Hybrid PtNP-Loaded
Stomatocyte
Ten milligrams of polymer with different ratios
between PEG-b-PS and PEG-b-PCL was
fully dissolved in a 1 mL mixture of THF/dioxane (4:1, v/v). Next,
0.35 mL of Milli-Q water was slowly added by a syringe pump at a rate
of 1 mL/h, followed by addition of preformed PtNP solution (0.65 mL)
also at a rate of 1 mL/h. After dialysis for at least 48 h, PtNP-loaded
stomatocytes and hybrid PtNP-loaded stomatocytes with different percentages
of PCL were obtained.

DSC Measurement of Hybrid Stomatocytes with
Different Percentages
of PCL
Hybrid stomatocyte samples with different percentages
of PCL blending (0, 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100% PCL) were prepared by
the solvent switch method. The samples were freeze-dried for DSC measurement.
DSC thermograms were recorded using the Mettler DSC 822e (Mettler-Toledo
AG, Greifensee, Switzerland). Samples (10 mg) were crimped in aluminum
pans with pierced lids, equilibrated at 0 °C for 5 min, and finally
heated to 100 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. The measurement
cell was purged with dry nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 50 mL/min
during the measurements.

Movement Analysis
Nanosight NS500
was used for the
motion measurements of hybrid stomatocyte nanomotors. Hydrogen peroxide
solution (4.98 mM) was used for the motion analysis. Hybrid nanomotor
solution with a final concentration around 108 particles/mL
was added, and the resulting solution was measured at physiological
temperature of 37 °C. The motion of hybrid stomatocyte nanomotors
after acidic degradation was also measured. The fitting of the MSD
allows for calculation of the speed of the nanomotors by using the
self-diffusiophoretic model proposed by Golestanian and co-workers.59 While a purely diffusive system would show only
a linear component according to the equation (4D)Δt, from which an enhanced diffusion coefficient can be extracted,
our MSD curves are not linear and show a parabolic fit according to
the equation (4D)Δt + (v2)(Δt2), from
which we can extract the velocity of the particles.
