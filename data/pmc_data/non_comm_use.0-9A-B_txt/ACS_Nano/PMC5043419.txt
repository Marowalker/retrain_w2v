DNA
nanotechnology allows for the creation of three-dimensional
structures at nanometer scale. Here, we use DNA to build the largest
synthetic pore in a lipid membrane to date, approaching the dimensions
of the nuclear pore complex and increasing the pore-area and the conductance
10-fold compared to previous man-made channels. In our design, 19
cholesterol tags anchor a megadalton funnel-shaped DNA origami porin
in a lipid bilayer membrane. Confocal imaging and ionic current recordings
reveal spontaneous insertion of the DNA porin into the lipid membrane,
creating a transmembrane pore of tens of nanosiemens conductance.
All-atom molecular dynamics simulations characterize the conductance
mechanism at the atomic level and independently confirm the DNA porins’
large ionic conductance.

==== Body
Due to their
diverse architectures,
protein channels in natural lipid membranes are capable of fulfilling
a variety of functions in living cells, from the recognition of substrates
to the selective transport of ions or large biomolecules between cellular
compartments.1 Synthetic channels have
been proposed as components of drug-delivery systems, as antimicrobial
agents, biosensors, filters, photosystems, catalysts,2 or as tools for synthetic biology;3 all undoubtedly requiring tailored architectures with a high level
of customizability. Efforts to create synthetic channels started three
decades ago with the first account by Tabushi et al.4 and are still ongoing.5 The architectural variability of biological membrane proteins,
spanning 1 order of magnitude in channel diameter and 3 orders of
magnitude in molecular weight and conductance, remains however widely
unexplored and often inaccessible due to limitations of chemical synthesis
methods especially for large synthetic channels.2 DNA has previously been used as an alternative highly stable
and readily available chemical block for building transmembrane pores,6−11 but the pore’s architectures have so far been limited to
the following three pore types: a bundle of six DNA duplexes with
a nominal inner channel diameter of 2 nm,6−9,11 a
bundle of four duplexes with a 0.8 nm channel,10 and a single membrane-spanning duplex which induces DNA-lipid
channels at its circumference.12 Reported
conductances of these DNA channels range from 0.112 to 1.6 nS.9,11

Here we expand the design
space of synthetic lipid membrane pores
beyond these limits by creating a significantly larger funnel-shaped
porin from DNA origami.13 Made exclusively
using off-the-shelf components, our DNA origami porin overcomes limitations
of traditional chemical synthesis that finds creation of large channels
challenging.2 The nominal cross section
of the DNA porin is 6 nm, Figure 1B, which is wider than the cross section of large natural
porins14 and comparable to the electrical
diameter of the nuclear pore complex.15 Previously, funnel-shaped large-diameter DNA origami nanopores were
inserted into SiN apertures,16 however
insertion of large-diameter nanopores into lipid membranes has not
been described until now.

its double-layered middle section is collapsed.

Results and Discussion
Design and Characterization of the DNA Origami
Porin
The design of our DNA origami porin derives from that
of the very
first DNA nanopore,16 which has been modified
to accommodate 19 cholesterol anchors to facilitate insertion into
a lipid membrane. The 5 MDa DNA origami porin was assembled using
the 7249 base-long M13mp18 scaffold and 179 single-stranded DNA staples.
For the DNA origami layout, positions of cholesterol anchors, and
DNA sequences see Supporting Information, Figures S1–S4 and Tables S1–S6. Agarose gel electrophoresis
yields a sharp band and confirms the stability of the structure in
the measurement buffer (Supporting Information, Figure S5). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, Figure 1C, clearly resolve
the funnel shape of the DNA origami nanopore, including its three
segments with an average length of 20.8 ± 2.5, 23.6 ± 2.1,
and 11.0 ± 1.7 nm (n = 10) for the wide, the
middle, and the narrow sections of the porin structure, respectively,
resulting in a total measured length of 55.4 nm. These values are
in good agreement with the designed dimensions (20, 24, 10 nm; total
length: 54 nm). For a detailed description of the image analysis see Supporting Information, Note S1, Figures S6,
S7, and Tables S7, S8. Assuming geometrical packing and a 2 nm diameter
of the DNA helix,17 the designed square
segments have a width and height of 22 × 22, 18 × 18, and
10 × 10 nm2. The measured dimensions (46.7 ±
2.0 × 2.67, 35.8 ± 2.0 × 5.95, and 18.9 ± 2.0
× 2.67 nm2) show the collapse of the hollow funnel
when imaged in air. Consequently, the middle segment of the funnel
(which is made of two layers of DNA) is roughly twice as high as the
other segments (which are made from a single DNA layer).

Confocal Fluorescent
Imaging of Membrane Attachment
To probe effective attachment
of the DNA origami porin to lipid membranes,
we carried out confocal fluorescent imaging experiments. For this
purpose, three Cy3-labeled fluorescent DNA oligomers were incorporated
during assembly of the funnel-shaped DNA porin at its wider end. The
same construct was prepared without the cholesterol membrane anchors
as a negative control. After addition to giant unilamellar vesicles
(GUVs), bright rings appeared around the vesicles in the confocal
plane for the cholesterol-tagged sample, Figure 2A, whereas no membrane adhesion was observed
for the control sample, Figure 2B.

DphPC lipid vesicles after addition of the Cy3-labeled DNA origami
porin, c = 1 nM, with (A) 19 cholesterol tags and
(B) no hydrophobic tags (negative control).

Ionic Current Recordings
We subsequently carried out
ionic current recordings in solvent-containing membranes18 to prove the membrane-insertion capabilities
of the synthetic DNA porin and to determine its ionic conductance.
As shown in Figure 3A, multiple high-conductance insertion steps were observed. A stepwise
decrease in conductance, Figure 3B, could be caused by DNA porins escaping from the
membrane. Additional insertion and closure traces are presented in
the Supporting Information, Figures S8
and S9. The log-scale histogram obtained from such conductance steps, Figure 3C, is rather broad.
The mean stepwise current increase associated with a DNA porin insertion
lies at 30 nS in 1 M KCl, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES), pH 6.0. The widespread of conductance values is likely
to be caused by multiple factors. Previous MD simulations have suggested
that the conductance of DNA pores can be influenced by membrane pressure.19 Hence, a certain amount of variability is expected
among experiments which involve breaking and reforming the membrane.
Agarose gel electrophoresis (Supporting Information, Figure S5) indicates the presence of dimerized DNA origami porins
(∼15%), which could account for higher conductances if they
are capable of inserting jointly. Deviations from perpendicular insertion
orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer plane is likely to account
for further variability.

porin in 1 M KCl, 10
mM MES, pH 6.0. (A) Exemplary current traces showing two consecutive
insertions, recorded at 10 mV, and (B) a closure step, recorded at
20 mV. (C) Histogram of conductance steps with logarithmic binning
including stable insertions and closures as well as insertion attempts.
The dashed line at 30 nS represents the mean of the histogram. (D)
Current–voltage characteristics of stable insertions of the
DNA porin. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation of six
independent recordings. The dashed line represents a linear fit.

To determine the current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics of
the DNA porin, only insertions which
were stable across the voltage range of ±100 mV and for the duration
of the I–V recording were
taken into account. I–V characteristics, Figure 3D, were found to
be largely ohmic between −50 and +50 mV. The dashed line represents
a linear fit with a gradient of 20 nS for this subset of stable insertions.
A corresponding trace is shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S10. Deviations from the linear behavior
are often observed above ±50 mV: The DNA origami porins can switch
to lower conductance states or disappear entirely as the voltage is
increased, in line with previous observations for smaller DNA-based
membrane pores.9,10 Rarely, the conductance increases
at higher voltages while the current exhibits large fluctuations.
Although some insertions could be stable for tens of minutes (Supporting Information, Figures S8E, S10), transient
insertions or attempts prevail in ionic current recordings (Supporting Information, Figure S9D), contributing
to the width of the reported conductance histogram.

MD Simulations
To independently evaluate the ionic
conductance of our synthetic DNA-based porin, we built an all-atom
model including all components of the experimental system: the DNA
origami porin itself, the DphPC lipid bilayer, ions, and water molecules, Figure 4A, resulting in a
system of 7,963,516 atoms. In the first 48 ns of the equilibration
simulation, the DNA porin was restrained to its initial coordinates,
allowing the membrane and the solvent to adopt an equilibrium configuration.
The restraints were gradually removed over 14.4 ns. The system was
subsequently simulated in the absence of restraints for another 19.2
ns. The DNA porin structure after free equilibration simulation is
shown in the Supporting Information, Figure
S12. During equilibration simulations, lipid molecules rearranged
around the transmembrane part of the DNA porin, forming a water-filled
passage along the DNA porins’ outer surface, Figure 4B. The formation of such water-filled
passages has previously been reported for a transmembrane-spanning
porphyrin-tagged DNA duplex.12 The process
of lipid rearrangement is shown as a time series in the Supporting Information, Figure S11. Approximately
900 water molecules, or 50 per 180° segment of each DNA duplex,
surrounded the DNA porin within a 1 nm thick rectangular slab centered
at the middle plane of the membrane. The interior volume of the channel
was filled with solution as well. This gives rise to an effective
electrical diameter of approximately 11 nm for the DNA porin, making
it larger than the electrical diameter proposed for the nuclear pore
complex (6 nm).15 The equilibrium ion concentration
outside the DNA porin was close to the target bulk values (1.1 M KCl
and 20 mM MgCl2); the concentration of Mg2+ was
found to vary considerably within the system, increasing to 0.6 M
within the DNA porin’s walls, Supporting Information, Figure S12.

bilayer. (A) All-atom model of the DNA porin (blue and yellow) with

atoms. Electric field, E, in direction of positive
transmembrane bias is indicated. (B) Steady-state local densities

The maps were computed from a 19.2 ns long MD trajectory at a +100
mV bias sampled with a frequency of 240 ps, radially averaged about
the z-axis to improve the resolution. (C) Cumulative
charge transmitted across the lipid bilayer membrane at +100 mV (dark

integrating the respective instantaneous current curves versus simulation time. (D) All-point conductance histograms with logarithmic
binning. The conductance histograms were computed using block averaged
instantaneous currents at +100, +30, −30, and −100 mV
transmembrane biases; the block average size was 2.88 ns. The dashed
line indicates the mean conductance value (46.6 nS). (E) I–V characteristics.
The data are block averaged with a block size of 2.88 ns. Error bars
indicate the standard error of the mean, the dashed line represents
a linear fit.

To evaluate its ionic
conductance, the DNA porin was simulated
at +100, +30, −30, and −100 mV transmembrane biases,
reproducing the experimental voltage range. The duration of each MD
simulation was 19.2 ns at ±100 mV and 48 ns at ±30 mV, which
was sufficient to observe statistically significant displacement of
ions within the MD trajectories.19−21Supporting Information, Movie S1, described in Note S2, illustrates
the MD trajectory of the system. The cumulative charge transmitted
across the lipid bilayer over time is plotted in Figure 4C. Around 80% of ions flow
through the central pore, while ion flow along the outside of the
channel contributes 20% to the total conductance. Figure 4D shows the histogram of the
simulated conductance with a mean of 46.6 nS (dashed line, for additional
conductance histograms see Supporting Information, Figure S13).

Although the width of the simulated conductance
histogram is similar
to that obtained from our experiments, the time scale of our MD simulation
precludes us from making a definitive statement about the possible
origin of broad conductance histograms. At the time scale of 50 ns,
a considerable fraction of the ionic current noise is produced by
thermal fluctuations.22 Another factor
is the deformation of the funnel structure and fluctuations of the
toroidal lipid pore, which can be appreciated from the Supporting Information, Movie S1, and snapshots
of the equilibrated structure, Supporting Information, Figure S12A,B. 32% of the experimentally recorded insertion steps
fall outside the conductance range obtained from MD simulations. Assuming
that the simulated range is correct, this could represent the fraction
of pores that inserted in an orientation different from that considered
in MD simulations. In absolute numbers, 23 of the experimentally obtained
insertion steps had lower conductances, potentially due to angled
insertion, whereas 3 exhibited higher conductances, potentially due
to the insertion of dimers. The I–V curve obtained from simulations, Figure 4E, is ohmic and yields an average conductance
of 46.6 nS. The simulated conductance is thus in very good agreement
with the experimental data, taking into account the difference in
the access resistance conditions and systematic overestimation of
bulk electrolyte conductance in the simulation.19

Coarse-Grained Simulations
To determine
if the gain
in free energy produced by incorporation of cholesterol anchors into
a lipid bilayer membrane can indeed compensate the free energy penalty
associated with the formation of a lipid pore, we estimated the free
energy of pore formation using the MARTINI coarse-grained model,23 which is known to semiquantitatively reproduce
the mechanical properties of lipid bilayers.24,25 Starting from an equilibrated lipid bilayer system, a pore of radius Rp was created by applying a cylindrical half-harmonic
wall potential to lipid molecules,25Figure 5A. Figure 5B plots the average pressure
exerted by the lipid molecules on the potential wall as a function
of the pore radius Rp. The pressure increases
initially reaching 300 bar for Rp = 0.5
nm, then decreases monotonically as Rp increases, leveling off at ∼20 bar. The work required to
form a pore of radius Rp can be determined
by integrating the pressure–volume (pV) work,
see Methods section. Previous MD studies estimated
the insertion free energy of a single cholesterol molecule into a
lipid bilayer at ΔgCHL = −75
kJ/mol.26 For the DNA porin insertion to
be favorable, the sum of the pore formation work, Wp(Rp), and the insertion free
energy of N cholesterol anchors, ΔGCHL(N) = NΔgCHL, must be negative. Figure 5C plots the value of the sum as a function
of the pore radius and the number of cholesterol anchors. For the
DNA porin system reported in this work, N = 19 and Rp ∼ 5.5 nm (determined from the lipid
headgroup density, Supporting Information, Figure S11), so Wp(Rp) + ΔGCHL(N) is roughly −400 kJ/mol, a value favoring
insertion of the DNA porin into a lipid bilayer.

simulation. Cut-away view of a large (50 nm on edge) patch of a lipid
bilayer membrane containing a single cylindrical pore and submerged

coarse-grained beads representing lipid hydrocarbon, phosphate, and
choline are shown in gray, red, and blue, respectively. The orange
cylinder indicates the half-harmonic potential wall that stabilizes
the pore. (B) Pressure exerted on the half-harmonic potential wall
by the lipid molecules, pp, as a function
of the pore radius, Rp. The pressure was
computed by dividing the total force applied by the potential wall
to the lipid molecules by the surface area, 2πRpLp, where Lp = 4 nm is the lipid bilayer thickness. (C) Free energy
of DNA porin insertion as a function of the pore radius and the number
of cholesterol anchors. The free energy was computed as the sum of
the work required to create a pore of radius Rp, Wp(Rp), and the insertion free energy of N cholesterol
anchors, ΔGCHL(N). Wp(Rp) was computed by integrating the pore formation work (pressure
× volume): Wp(Rp) = ∫0Rppp(r) × 2πrLpdr. ΔGCHL(N) was computed as ΔgCHL × N, where the insertion free
energy of a single cholesterol (ΔgCHL = −75 kJ/mol) was taken from a previous atomistic MD study.26 The star indicates the DNA porin system described
in this work.

Conclusion
In
the present study, we have demonstrated a synthetic DNA membrane
porin with the largest conductance known to date. Electrophysiological
experiments and MD simulations have shown that the conductance of
our DNA origami porin is over an order of magnitude larger compared
to all previous DNA membrane pores. In nature, such high conductances
are rare and have only been measured for few toxins27,28 or suggested for the nuclear pore complex. Our work demonstrates
that cholesterol-based membrane anchoring is a viable method for creating
larger DNA pores with diameters of several nanometers. From a methodological
point of view, we introduce MD-guided design of synthetic pores by
demonstrating excellent agreement between simulation and experiment.

The choice of an appropriate nanopore architecture will ultimately
depend on the target application. Large scaffold-based DNA nanopores
like our DNA origami porin are ideally suited for functionalization
and can provide space for the passage of larger biomolecules. Such
DNA pores are prime candidates for single-molecule sensing or as a
research tool to study transport at molecular level if the occurrence
of stable insertions can be enhanced and match the longevity of protein
pores. In biological environments, our large synthetic DNA porins
could mimic the behavior of toxins or more complex systems like the
nuclear pore complex. With this combination of experiments and MD
simulations expanding the design space of synthetic membrane pores,
we envision custom-made pores to become a versatile toolbox for cross-disciplinary
applications; even if today, we may still be humble apprentices of
nature.

Methods
Design of the Cholesterol-Tagged
DNA Origami Porin
The funnel-shaped DNA origami was designed
on a square lattice adapted
from an earlier design16 using the open
source plug-in caDNAno.17 Custom DNA oligomers
(for sequences see Supporting Information, Tables S1–S6) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc.

Molecular Self-Assembly
Ten nM of the M13mp18 scaffold
(New England Biolabs) was mixed with 100 nM of the 179 staples and
annealed for 23 h in 40 mM Tris-HCl, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA,
14 mM MgCl2, pH 8.2 using a protocol described previously.29

Purification
Structures were purified
from excess staples via spin-filtration with 100
kDa MWCO filters (Amicon) in
40 mM Tris-HCl, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 8.2. The MgCl2 concentration was reduced to prevent
sticking to the filter membrane and readjusted to 14 mM after filtration.
This protocol yielded approximately 65 ng/μL assembled structures
as determined by UV–vis spectroscopy (NanoDrop 2000, Fisher
Scientific). The concentration was then adjusted to 10 nM.

Attachment
of Cholesterol Anchors
The cholesterol-modified
strands (3′ cholesterol-TEG from Integrated DNA Technologies,
5′ cholesterol-C6 from Biomers, for sequences see Supporting Information, Table S6, positions are
indicated in Figure S4) were heated to 50 °C for 10 min to dissolve
aggregates and incubated with the DNA origami for 10 min at room temperature
in 5× excess and 40 mM Tris-HCl, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA,
14 mM MgCl2 directly before each experiment.

Atomic Force
Microscopy
Five μL of the DNA origami
porin (10 nM) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0 was deposited on a freshly cleaved mica surface (Agar Scientific)
and incubated for 90 s. Subsequently, the surface was rinsed 3×
with 1 mL of Milli-Q water (Merck Millipore) to remove excess sample
and blow-dried with nitrogen. Imaging was carried out using a Cypher
S AFM (Oxford Instruments) in amplitude modulation in air and at room
temperature using AC240TS cantilevers (Olympus) with a nominal spring
constant of 2 N/m. The set-point to free amplitude ratio was generally
kept around 70% with a free oscillation amplitude of 20 nm. The frequency
of excitation was set close to the resonance of the first flexural
mode (around 70 kHz), and a repulsive mode was preferred. The scan
speed was set to either 1 or 2 Hz obtaining an image of 256 ×
256 pixels. The images were flattened and band-pass filtered using
Gwyddion (http://gwyddion.net/). Image analysis was performed
as described in the Supporting Information, Note S1, Figures S6, S7, and Tables S7, S8.

Lipid Vesicle Preparation
1,2-Diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DphPC; Avanti Polar Lipids), 10%
cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) GUVs were prepared via electroformation using the Vesicle Prep Pro unit (Nanion technologies,
Germany) and a protocol adapted from Angelova et al.30 as previously described.12

Confocal Fluorescent Imaging
For
confocal imaging,
three staples on the wider end of the DNA origami porin were replaced
by Cy3-tagged ones (Integrated DNA Technologies, see Supporting Information, Figures S2, S3). Vesicles were suspended
in 500 mM KCl, 10 mM MES, pH 6.0 in an incubation chamber (Grace Biolabs)
and imaged using a Confocal Leica TCS SP5 microscope with a 60×
oil immersion objective in bright field and fluorescence mode. While
imaging, the fluorescently labeled DNA origami porins were added at
a concentration of 1 nM, keeping the osmolarity balanced. The Cy3
tag was excited at 514 nm using an argon or a HeNe594 laser, and emission
was collected above 530 nm. Images were processed using ImageJ.

Ionic Current Recordings
Ionic current recordings were
carried out using solvent (n-decane, Alexis) containing
DphPC membranes31 (Avanti Polar Lipids)
following the detailed protocol by Gutsmann et al.18 Solvent containing membranes are known
to promote pore insertion and have previously been used for the discovery
of unknown protein pores18 or DNA channels.12 Current data were acquired at a sampling rate
of 1 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and analyzed in Matlab and
Clampfit. After a stable membrane was formed, the DNA porin (in 40
mM Tris-HCl, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, 14 mM MgCl2,
pH 8.2) was added to the cis-side at concentrations
between 0.5 and 1.0 nM in 1 M KCl, 10 mM MES, pH 6.0. Additional ionic
current recordings were carried out on the nanolipid bilayer setup32 under the same buffer conditions using a procedure
described before.10

General MD Methods
All MD simulations were performed
using the program NAMD2,33 periodic boundary
conditions, the CHARMM36 parameter set for water, ions, and nucleic
acids,34 CHARMM parameters for the DphPC
lipid bilayer,35 custom parametrization
of ion–DNA and ion–ion interactions.36 All simulations employed a 2–2–6 fs multiple
timestepping, SETTLE algorithm to keep water molecules rigid,37 RATTLE algorithm to keep all other covalent
bonds involving hydrogen atoms rigid,38 a 8–10–12 Å cutoff for van der Waals and short-range
electrostatic forces. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed
using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method39 over a 1.2 Å resolution grid.40

Assembly of the Simulation System
The caDNAno design
of the DNA origami porin was converted to idealized all-atom structures
using a previously described method.41 Reproducing
the experimental system, cholesterol groups were added to termini
of selected DNA strands; the cholesterol groups were initially placed
to orient normal to the plane of the lipid bilayer. Before inserting
into the lipid membrane, the DNA origami structure was simulated using
the all-atom MD method for 1 ns in vacuum under a network of elastic
restraints which allowed the structure to globally relax its conformation.42 The DphPC lipid membranes were prepared by replicating
a small patch of a pre-equilibrated lipid bilayer. After merging the
synthetic DNA porin with the DphPC lipid membrane, DphPC molecules
located either within 3 Å of the DNA porin or inside the channel
were removed. Mg2+-hexahydrates36 were randomly placed near the DNA origami porin in the amount required
to exactly compensate the electrical charge of the latter. Following
that, water and 1 M KCl were added using the Solvate and Autoionize
plugins of VMD.

Equilibration of the All-Atom Model
To equilibrate
the DNA origami porin, we first cut away a 11 nm slab of the initial
all-atom model containing the lipid membrane (5 nm thick) and the
adjacent 6 nm-thick cross-section of the solvated DNA origami. The
resulting system was energy-minimized for 1200 steps and equilibrated
for 48 ns, allowing the lipid bilayer and the solution to adopt equilibrium
conformation around the structure; the DNA atoms were restrained to
maintain their initial coordinates during this equilibration simulation
(with the spring constant kspring = 1
kcal/(mol Å2)). Following that, the equilibrated lipid
bilayer and the surrounding solvent were combined with the full-length
DNA origami porin. The resulting system was equilibrated under a network
of elastic restrains that maintained distances between atomic pairs
at their initial values; such elastic restraints excluded hydrogen
atoms, phosphate groups, atoms in the same nucleotide, and pairs separated
by more than 8 Å. The system was simulated under such elastic
restraints for 14.4 ns; the spring constants of the restraints were
decreased from 0.5 to 0.1 and then to 0.01 kcal/(mol Å2) every 4.8 ns. All equilibration simulations were performed under
the NPT condition, where the number of atoms (N),
pressure (P), and temperature (T) were kept constant. The pressure was set to 1 atm using the Nosé–Hoover
Langevin piston method.43,44 The temperature was
maintained at 295 K using a Langevin thermostat.45 The ratios of the system’s dimensions along the x and y axis were constrained, while the z axis was decoupled. Following that, the system was simulated
in the absence of any restraints for 19.2 ns. During all MD simulations,
the system’s coordinates were recorded every 48 ps.

MD Simulation
of Ionic Current
All simulations of the
ionic current were performed in the constant number of atom, volume,
and temperature ensemble. A voltage drop, V, across
the system was produced by applying an external electric field E such that V = −EL, where L was the length of the simulation system
in the direction of the applied field.46

Ionic Current Calculations
Prior to calculations of
the ionic current, frames of the MD trajectory were aligned46 using a two-step process. First, we shifted
the x and y coordinates of all atoms
in the simulation system by the same amount to maintain the center
of mass coordinate of the DNA origami porin constant within the plane
of the lipid bilayer. Next, the z-coordinates of
all atoms in the system were shifted by the same amount to maintain
the z-coordinate of the lipid bilayer center of mass
constant. To reduce thermal noise originating from stochastic displacements
of ions in the bulk solution, the ionic current calculations were
carried out within the −/2 ≤ z ≤ /2 region of
the system, where  = 30 Å.
The instantaneous current
was computed as 1  where 2  the
sum over i indicates
a sum over all ions, Δt is the time interval
between two consecutive frames of the MD trajectory, and qi is the charge of ion i.47 The average current of a trajectory
was computed by summing up all instantaneous currents and dividing
by the number of coordinate frames of the trajectory. To estimate
the error, the ionic current trace was first block averaged with a
block size of 2.88 ns. The reported standard errors of the mean were
calculated from the block-averaged current traces.

Calculations
of the Local Density and Local Ionic Current Flux
The local
density and the local ionic current flux were computed
as described previously.21 We divided the
simulation system into 5 × 5 × 5 Å grids and calculated
the average density of the selected atom groups and average flux of
each ion species in each grid using a sampling frequency of 240 ps.
The local current in each grid in a given direction (x, y, or z) was calculated by 3  where i is the ion species
(K+, Cl–, or Mg2+), qi is the charge of the ion,
and fi,j is the flux of the ion in the given direction. We averaged the three-dimensional
(3D) density and flux data in the cylindrical coordinate over the
azimuthal angle to obtain the mean density and mean flux on the r – z plane as described previously.19 Following that, the 2D density and flux were
made symmetric about the z axis by making a mirror
image (r → −r). Finally,
we used the contourf and streamplot function in the python matplotlib
package to generate the local density and flux plots, which were then
assembled into the final figures.

Coarse-Grained Simulation
of Lipid Pore Formation
The
MARTINI simulations were performed using the Gromacs 5.0.4 package
with a 20 fs time step and 12 Å cutoffs for nonbonded forces.48 The half-harmonic potential was implemented
using the MDRUN program of the Gromacs package.25 First, we equilibrated a lipid bilayer membrane containing
8192 dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid molecules and 96,000
water beads in a 50 × 50 × 9 nm3 simulation box
at zero surface tension under periodic boundary condition. We chose
to simulate DOPC lipids over DphPC because the current MARTINI force
field does not provide parametrization for DphPC. DOPC is analogous
to DphPC within the MARTINI’s coarse-graining framework that
maps four hydrocarbon atoms to one MARTINI bead. Following that, multiple
systems, each containing a single pore of prescribed radius, were
created by applying a half-harmonic cylindrical potential, Vp(r), to all DOPC beads: Vp(r) = 0.5k(r – Rp)2 for r < Rp and 0 otherwise, where Rp is the pore radius and r is the distance from the
pore axis. Each system was simulated for 300 ns; the average pressure
was computed using the last 200 ns of simulation. The error bars were
estimated as the standard error of 10 ns block averages.
