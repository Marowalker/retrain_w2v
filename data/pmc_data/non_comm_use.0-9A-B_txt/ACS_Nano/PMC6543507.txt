We
report on lasing at visible wavelengths in arrays of ferromagnetic
Ni nanodisks overlaid with an organic gain medium. We demonstrate
that by placing an organic gain material within the mode volume of
the plasmonic nanoparticles both the radiative and, in particular,
the high ohmic losses of Ni nanodisk resonances can be compensated.
Under increasing pump fluence, the systems exhibit a transition from
lattice-modified spontaneous emission to lasing, the latter being
characterized by highly directional and sub-nanometer line width emission.
By breaking the symmetry of the array, we observe tunable multimode
lasing at two wavelengths corresponding to the particle periodicity
along the two principal directions of the lattice. Our results are
relevant for loss-compensated magnetoplasmonic devices and topological
photonics.

==== Body
Plasmonic
resonators and cavities
provide small mode volumes and ultrafast light–matter interactions
at the nanoscale. Interactions between emitters and plasmonic modes
have been studied in both weak and strong coupling regimes.1,2 Theoretical and experimental investigations on lasing in plasmonic
systems have demonstrated the feasibility of compensating losses typical
for metallic nanostructures3−23 and providing ultrafast operation speeds.8,24 Lasing
as a loss-compensation mechanism would be particularly attractive
for magnetoplasmonics, which enables active light manipulation at
the nanoscale via field-controlled breaking of time-reversal
symmetry25 and versatile design of magneto-optical
responses.26 Potential applications of
magnetoplasmonic nanostructures include nonreciprocal optical devices,27 label-free biosensors,28,29 metrology,30 and ultrafast all-optical
magnetic switching.31 However, ohmic losses
in ferromagnetic metals are considerably larger than those in noble
metals, and the narrowing of intrinsically broad resonances via a transition to lasing has not been demonstrated yet.

Periodic arrays of metallic nanoparticles support collective surface
lattice resonances (SLRs) that originate from radiative coupling of
lossy single particle plasmon resonances with low-loss diffracted
orders (DOs) of the lattice.32−37 In optical transmission spectra, the DOs of an array appear as maxima
at λ ≈ np, where n is
the refractive index of the surrounding medium and p is the particle periodicity. Hybridized Fano-like SLR modes reduce
the signal, causing minimum transmission at a wavelength that deviates
from the DO.33−37 Despite the plasmonic component, SLRs in arrays of noble metal nanodisks
have particularly narrow line widths that can be utilized in lasing13−17,19,20,22 and Bose–Einstein condensation.38 Recently, it was demonstrated that collective
SLR modes can be excited also in arrays of higher-loss ferromagnetic
nanoparticles.39,40

Here, we report on lasing
in a lattice of ferromagnetic nanodisks
overlaid with optically pumped organic Rhodamine 6G (R6G) dye solution.
Reduced line widths provided by the SLRs together with a carefully
optimized lattice geometry and gain medium produce lasing at visible
wavelengths, despite the broad plasmonic resonances of the individual
nanodisks. Lasing is characterized by a highly directional and nonlinear
increase of sub-nanometer line width emission by more than 2 orders
of magnitude. Within the limits set by the gain profile of R6G, the
lasing wavelength can be tuned by varying the particle periodicity.
In rectangular arrays, we observe lasing at two wavelengths corresponding
to λ ≈ n × pi for different particle periodicities (px and py) along the two principle axes of the lattice.

Results
and Discussion
In our study, we used Ni as a ferromagnetic
plasmonic material.
We fabricated various arrays of Ni nanodisks on glass substrates using
electron-beam evaporation and lift-off in an electron-beam lithography
process. The nominal diameter and height of the nanodisks were 60
nm, and the size of the total array was 300 μm × 300 μm.
As a reference, we considered a square array with px = py = 380 nm. In rectangular arrays with broken symmetry, px was kept constant and py was varied from 370 to 390
nm in 5 nm steps. The gain medium consisting of 35 mM R6G in 1:2 dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)/benzyl alcohol (BA) was inserted between the substrate
with Ni nanodisk arrays and a cover glass.

A schematic of the
measurement setup including excitation and detection
lines is depicted in Figure 1a. The sample was excited by 100 fs laser pulses with a wavelength
of 500 nm at a 1 kHz repetition rate and from a 45° angle. The
diameter of the pump spot was approximately 100 μm. Emitted
light from the sample was collected with a 10× 0.3 NA objective
lens. The back focal plane of the objective lens was focused to the
entrance slit of a spectrometer. The long axis of the slit was aligned
along the y-axis of the sample. From 2D intensity
data collected by the CCD camera of the spectrometer, the wavelength
and in-plane ky vector
were calculated using ky = k0 sin (θ).19 Here k0 = 2π/λ
and θ is the angle with respect to the sample normal. We note
that we did not apply a magnetic field during the lasing experiments.
A scanning electron microscopy image of the square 380 nm × 380
nm reference array is shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of the measurement setup. Emission spectra
are measured
by focusing the back focal plane of the objective lens to the entrance
slit of the spectrometer. The gain medium is pumped by x-polarized 100 fs laser pulses with a wavelength of 500 nm and a
1 kHz repetition rate. The gain medium is inserted between the substrate
with Ni nanodisk arrays and a cover glass. (b) Scanning electron microscopy
image of the 380 nm × 380 nm array. In all experiments, the diameter
and height of the Ni nanodisks are 60 nm. The scale bar corresponds
to 500 nm. (c) Experimental transmission curves for the Ni nanodisk
array with px = 380 nm
and py = 370 nm. Data
for incident polarization along the x and y directions of the array are shown. (d,e) Finite-difference
time-domain simulations of near-field distributions in the same array.
The simulations are performed for x- and y-polarized plane-wave excitation at the SLR wavelength.

Figure 1c shows
experimental transmission curves of the Ni nanodisk array with px = 380 nm and py = 370 nm for incident polarization
along x and y (see Supporting Information, Figure S1 for measurements on other
arrays). The intensity maxima are close to the DOs of the lattice.
Because the DO wavelength depends on the particle periodicity perpendicular
to the polarization axis, the transmission curve for x-polarized light is blue-shifted with respect to the spectrum measured
with y-polarization. Coupling of a narrow DO to a
broad localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the Ni nanodisks
produces a collective SLR mode.39 The SLR
wavelength (minimum transmission in Figure 1c) corresponds to the wavelength where 1/α
– S is 0.34,35 Here, S is the so-called array factor and α is the polarizability
of a single Ni nanodisk. Damping of the SLR mode depends sensitively
on the imaginary part of 1/α. Consequently, noble metal nanodisks
with large polarizability produce narrow SLR modes with a line width
of <10 nm when ordered into periodic arrays.32−37 Because of larger ohmic losses in Ni (i.e., small
α), the SLRs in our plasmonic arrays are much broader (>100
nm; see Figure 1c).
Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the 380 nm ×
370 nm Ni nanodisk array at the SLR wavelengths (Figure 1d,e) show intense electric
near fields in the particle plane, confirming the plasmonic character
of this collective mode. Next, we demonstrate that despite the large
line width of SLR excitations, it is possible to realize lasing in
Ni nanostructures.

Figure 2a,b shows
the ky and wavelength-resolved
emission from the sample with a 380 nm × 380 nm Ni nanodisk array
for a pump fluence below and above the lasing threshold (Pth ≈ 3.3 mJ cm–2). Below the
threshold, the emission consists of two contributions. The first contribution
has no angular dependence and originates from the R6G molecules. Because
the molecules are spatially far away from the nanoparticles (and outside
the SLR mode volume), they do not emit to the SLR mode. Their emission
spectrum has a line width of ∼60 nm, which is the same as that
for the R6G dye solution in the absence of the nanodisk array. The
second emission contribution follows the ⟨+1,0⟩ and
⟨−1,0⟩ DOs of the array (crossed dashed lines)
and, thus, depicts spontaneous emission of the molecules to the SLR
modes. As expected from λ = n × pi and the transmission curves
of Figure 1c, the DOs
related to the periodicity py cross at λ = 578 nm if py = 380 nm and n = 1.52. At a higher
pump fluence of 1.3Pth, we observe an
intense single emission peak at λ ≈ 580 nm with a narrow
line width of <1 nm and a small beam divergence of 5.7°. The
lasing peak is slightly red-shifted from the DOs to a wavelength where
the R6G dye solution can emit to the SLR modes of the Ni nanodisk
array. The transition from spontaneous emission to lasing is manifested
as an abrupt change in the emission spectrum (Figure 2c). Figure 2d summarizes the variation of the emission intensity
and line width with increasing pump fluence. Most notably, we measure
a strongly nonlinear increase of the emission intensity from ∼2
× 102 to ∼105 if the pump fluence
is enhanced from 3.2 to 3.45 mJ cm–2. Simultaneously,
the line width of the emission peak decreases from ∼60 to <1
nm. We note that the lasing peak line width of our Ni system is similar
to those obtained with 2D arrays of Au, Ag, or Al nanoparticles (values
range from 0.1 to 1.5 nm in refs (13, 18, 19, 21, and 22)). Thus, despite much larger losses
in Ni nanodisk arrays (SLR line width >100 nm compared to 4–10
nm in noble metal lattices), intense and narrow line width lasing
is still attained if enough gain is provided. This finding demonstrates
that lasing can be used as a powerful tool to circumvent losses in
magnetoplasmonic systems.

Figure 2 Angle and wavelength resolved emission of a
symmetric 380 nm ×
380 nm Ni nanodisk array below (a) and above (b) the lasing threshold.
The dashed lines indicate the DOs of the array. Because the momentum
direction ky is monitored
here, the ⟨+1,0⟩ and ⟨−1,0⟩ DOs
related to the periodicity py appear as a cross feature, whereas the one related to px (at 578 nm) has a parabolic
shape. The former is sometimes called TE and the latter TM mode in
the literature.2 (c) Emission intensity
at ky = 0 as a function
of pump fluence. (d) Line width (squares) and intensity (circles)
of the emission peak showing an abrupt nonlinear change of these parameters
at a threshold pump fluence Pth ≈
3.3 mJ cm–2.

Next, we break the symmetry of the Ni nanodisk array by keeping px constant and increasing py from 370 to 390 nm in 5 nm
steps. Figure 3 shows
emission spectra of these samples for a pump fluence of 4.6 mJ cm–2. In (a), we observe two emission maxima, one at the
same wavelength, λ ≈ 580 nm, as that for the square array
(see Figure 3c) and
the other at λ ≈ 565 nm. Threshold behavior and line
width imply lasing action for both peaks. We note that the maximum
at 565 nm is 15 nm blue-shifted from the other lasing peak. We associate
this emission with the reduced particle periodicity along the y direction. The expected 15 nm blue-shift based on Δλ
= n × Δpy supports this argument, as well as the FDTD simulations
of Supporting Information, Figure S3. The
emission maximum at 580 nm is associated with the larger periodicity
of the rectangular Ni nanodisk array along the x direction.

having px = 380 nm and py ranging from 370 to 390 nm

label the crossing wavelength of the ⟨−1,0⟩ and
⟨+1,0⟩ diffracted orders related to the periodicity py of the array. (f–j)
Dispersions of respective ideal infinite arrays computed using the T-matrix method for E in-plane modes. Dispersion
bands of the array are characterized by singular values of the underlying
scattering problem (1) reaching near 0.

In agreement with the dependence of the two lasing peaks
on particle
periodicity, the lower-wavelength emission maximum red shifts when py increases to 375 nm, whereas
the other peak remains fixed at 580 nm (Figure 3b). A further increase of py to 380 nm results in a square nanodisk
lattice, and consequently, the two emissions merge into one intense
lasing peak (Figure 3c). For py > 380
nm,
one would expect a second lasing peak to appear at λ > 580
nm.
As can be seen from the emission data in Figure 3d,e, this is not the case. We explain the
absence of the anticipated second peak by a reduced overlap of the
SLR mode with the wavelength-dependent gain profile of the R6G dye
solution. At wavelengths corresponding to py > 380 nm, the R6G gain is insufficient to compensate
for the lossy SLR mode of the Ni nanodisk array, resulting in much
weaker spontaneous emission instead of lasing. For py < 380 nm, the spectrum of the R6G
gain medium overlaps more with the energy of the py-related SLR mode, and consequently,
multimode lasing is observed. Two-mode lasing has been observed previously
for noble metals.19,21 Moreover, for Al nanoparticles,
it has been shown that highly asymmetric 1D arrays do also lase.22

To understand the mode properties, we
employ a multiple-scattering T-matrix approach 1  where M(ω, k) is a matrix depending on scattering and
wave propagation properties of the array at a given frequency ω
and aν(ω, k) is a vector of coefficients describing
multipole nanoparticle excitations of a given mode. The problem (1)
has a nontrivial solution; that is, a mode exists if the matrix M(ω, k) has a 0 singular
value (SV). Therefore, to find modes supported by the array, we scan
ω, k space to search for SV minima
of M(ω, k). Due
to losses, SV minima are not exactly 0 for real ω, k, but near 0 SVs nevertheless provide valuable information
about the dispersion of the array. Figure 3f–j illustrates calculated modes with
the lowest SVs of M(ω, k), resembling the experimental data of Figure 3a–e. The Materials
and Methods section provides more details on the numerical
model.

Finally, we analyze the polarization properties of the
lasing modes
in our Ni nanodisk samples with a R6G gain medium. Experimentally,
this was done by placing a polarizer between the sample and spectrometer
to determine the emission intensity with polarization along the x and y directions of the arrays. Figure 4a–e presents
emission spectra for both polarization states at ky = 0 and a pump fluence of 4.6 mJ cm–2. In (a), the low wavelength emission related to py is x-polarized,
whereas the px-related
lasing peak at 580 nm exhibits both polarizations. We note that the x-polarization of this peak disappears at higher pump fluence
(see Supporting Information, Figures S4 and S5). We observe similar behavior in (b), with a red shift in the lower
wavelength lasing peak because of larger py. For the square array (c), we observe lasing at
a single wavelength due to mode degeneracy. In (d), lasing takes place
at the wavelength of the px-related SLR mode only. The lasing peak in this emission spectrum
exhibits both polarizations. Finally, in (e), single mode lasing with
reduced x-polarization is measured.

Figure 4 (a–e) Emission
spectra at ky = 0 for
samples having px = 380
nm and py ranging from
370 to 390 nm. The pump fluence is 4.6 mJ cm–2.
(f–j) Calculated singular values for arrays
with the same particle periodicities. The blue and orange colors correspond
to x- and y-polarized dipolar modes
(B1,2′), respectively, and the green color corresponds to
a quadrupolar mode (A2′).

The polarization properties are also studied by the T-matrix method, which can uncover both x- and y-polarized dipolar as well as quadrupolar
contributions
at each wavelength. Figure 4f–j summarizes the results for the different Ni nanodisk
arrays. In (f), SV minima are calculated for two dipolar modes corresponding
to the experimentally observed wavelengths in (a) and polarizations
at high pump fluence. The same applies for (g). In (h), the square
array exhibits degeneracy of the dipolar modes. This raises the question
whether the experimental observations in (c) are caused by lasing
action of two perpendicular dipolar modes or a quadrupolar mode. Finally,
in (i) and (j), we note that the model predicts a large quadrupolar
weight at the measured lasing wavelength in (d) and (e). In (d), the
experimental lasing peak exhibits both polarizations, and hence, the
mode is indeed quadrupolar. In contrast, lasing in (e) is almost purely y-polarized, suggesting dipolar mode lasing. To rationalize
this, we point out that a priori predictions of preferred
lasing modes are difficult because mode dynamics, mode competition
at available gain, and mode Q-factors all play a role. Furthermore,
we observe a dependence of lasing behavior on pump fluence (see Supporting Information, Figure S4 for a complete
set of emission spectra at different pump fluence). A more detailed
understanding of mode competition in Ni nanodisk arrays requires further
studies.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate lasing in a
high-loss ferromagnetic
plasmonic system. In rectangular Ni nanodisk arrays, we observe multimode
lasing and the coexistence of dipolar and quadrupolar modes. The results
of this paper can be used for incorporating gain into magnetoplasmonic
devices and realizing concepts for topological photonics. Notably,
topological lasing has been demonstrated recently.42−44 In topological
photonics,45−48 most lattice systems are based on nearest or next-nearest neighbor
coupling via overlapping optical near-fields. Our
Ni nanodisk arrays represent a radiatively coupled system where long-range
couplings produce collective SLR modes. The symmetry properties of
the array dictate the existence of energy degenerate modes at high-symmetry
points of the Brillouin zone,41 for which
the lifting of the degeneracy by a symmetry breaking mechanism can
lead to topological features. The magnetic moment of nanodisks in
a ferromagnetic array can be exploited for time-reversal symmetry
breaking in such lattices. The Ni nanodisk arrays discussed in this
paper show a magnetic circular dichroism effect of up to 0.5% in a
saturating magnetic field of 150 mT.49

Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation
We fabricated the samples on glass
substrates using electron-beam lithography. After a poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) layer was spin-coated and baked at 180 °C for 1 min, the
pattern was defined by exposing the resist layer to the electron beam.
We developed the PMMA in a 1:3 methyl isobutyl ketone/isopropyl alcohol
solution. Ni nanodisk arrays were fabricated by e-beam evaporation
of a 60 nm thick film, followed by lift-off. After being patterned,
the nanodisk arrays were covered by 2 nm Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition to protect Ni from degrading when
contacted by R6G molecules.

Sample Characterization
We measured
optical transmission
curves using a spectrometer with a broad-band supercontinuum laser.
For lasing measurements, the R6G gain medium was inserted between
the glass substrate with Ni nanodisk arrays and a cover glass. The
gain medium was pumped with a femtosecond laser (45° incident
angle, 500 nm center wavelength, 100 fs pulse width, 1 kHz repetition
rate, x-polarization). Emission spectra were recorded
as a function of wavelength and in-plane ky-vector by focusing the back focal plane of a 10×
0.3 NA objective onto the slit of a spectrometer (Figure 1a). The lasing peaks were measured
with three settings of the output polarization filter (x filter, y filter, no filter).

Simulations
The dispersion calculations in Figures 3f–j and 4f–j
were performed using a multiple-scattering T-matrix
approach. Here, we briefly introduce the model.
A more detailed description can be found in the Supporting Information
of ref (41).

The scattering properties of a single nanoparticle are first described
in terms of vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs), giving the T-matrix of the nanoparticle at a given frequency. In the
next step, electromagnetic interactions between nanoparticles are
calculated as translation operators Sn,n′, which describe how VSWFs
with one coordinate origin (located inside the nanoparticle n′) can be decomposed in a VSWF basis at another
origin (corresponding to the location of nanoparticle n). This yields a set of linear equations describing the scattering
properties of a system with many nanoparticles, which, in a per-particle
matrix form, can be written as 2  Here, the pext(n) column vectors contain the VSWF
expansion coefficients of the external electromagnetic radiation incident
onto the nth nanoparticle, and an is the vector of the unknown VSWF expansion
coefficients of the scattered field created by the nth nanoparticle.

For periodic systems, the field expansion
coefficients at different
nanoparticle sites attain the Bloch waveform of , where Ri are
the lattice vectors and k is the Bloch
wave vector. If there is only
one nanoparticle per unit cell and the T-matrices
are the same for all particles, eq 2 can be rewritten as  Labeling W = ∑i′ ≠ iSi, i′eik·(Ri′ – Ri) = ∑i′ ≠ 0S0, i′eik·Ri′, this gives 3  where the only challenge remains
in calculating the infinite lattice sums contained in the operator W, which in general diverge. One can work around this using
Ewald-type summation techniques.

Equation 3 with a
nonzero right-hand side describes the electromagnetic response of
a periodic array on external periodic driving. Putting the right-hand
side to 0 gives an equation for the electromagnetic modes supported
by the array. The electromagnetic bands are then given for points
(ω, k) in the frequency-quasimomentum
space where the matrix M(ω, k) ≡ I – T(ω)W(ω, k) is singular.
In other words, the dispersion of the array can be calculated by finding
a set of (ω, k) pairs for which M(ω, k) has a 0 singular
value. This usually does not exactly happen for real (ω, k) in lossy systems like our Ni nanodisk
arrays. However, the complex lossy bands are typically located near
the real (ω, k) points for which
some singular value of M(ω, k) reaches a small enough minimum.

Point-group symmetries
of nanoparticle arrays provide a lot of a priori information
about the modes and enable us to simplify
the calculations.50,51 All of the modes have to belong
to the irreducible representations of the respective symmetry group.
As a result, the M(ω, k = 0) matrix can be written in block-diagonal form, where
each block corresponds to one irreducible representation of the symmetry
group. Singular values can then be searched for in each block separately.
This is what we did to obtain the results of Figure 4f–j.

At the Γ point (where
the band edges responsible for lasing
typically appear), our system exhibits D2h symmetry (or even D4h for the square array). The transformation properties
of the irreducible representations under symmetry operations, encoded
in the character tables, also determine which multipole excitations
are allowed in each of the irreducible representations. In this way,
we can determine which irreducible representations contain x and y dipolar nanoparticle polarizations
or quadrupolar polarizations.

The T-matrix
can be obtained using various numerical
methods. For reliability reasons and due to the fact that the aspect
ratio of our nanodisks is close to 1, we used a spherical approximation
and calculated the T-matrix analytically using the
Lorenz–Mie solution, assuming a nanoparticle radius of 42 nm,
a homogeneous background medium with refractive index n = 1.52, and nanoparticles made of Ni with interpolated optical properties
from Johnson and Christy.52
