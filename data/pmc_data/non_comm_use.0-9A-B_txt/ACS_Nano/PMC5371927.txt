We report the exfoliation
of graphite in aqueous solutions under
high shear rate [∼ 108 s–1] turbulent
flow conditions, with a 100% exfoliation yield. The material is stabilized
without centrifugation at concentrations up to 100 g/L using carboxymethylcellulose
sodium salt to formulate conductive printable inks. The sheet resistance
of blade coated films is below ∼2Ω/□. This is
a simple and scalable production route for conductive inks for large-area
printing in flexible electronics.

==== Body
Printed electronics
combines
conducting, semiconducting, and insulating materials with printing
techniques, such as inkjet,1 flexography,2 gravure,3 and screen.4 Metal inks based on Ag,5 Cu,6 or Au7 are used due to their high conductivity σ ∼ 107 S/m,5,8,9 making
them the dominant technology in high-frequency electronics (e.g. for radio frequency identification, RFID).10,11 For flexible electronic devices, e.g., organic photovoltaics (OPVs), a sheet resistance, Rs [= 1/(σh), where h is the film thickness] < 10Ω/□ is required,12 while for printed RFID antennas, one needs a
few Ω/□.13 To minimize Rs and cover the underneath rough layers, such
as printed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),14 thick films (μm range) are deposited using
screen printing.1,14−16 This is a technique
in which the ink is forced mechanically by a squeegee through the
open areas of a stencil supported on a mesh of synthetic fabric.17 The ink must have high viscosity, μ (>500
mPas),18,19 because lower μ inks run through the
mesh rather than dispensing out of it.18 To achieve this μ, typical formulations contain a conductive
filler, such as Ag particles,20 and insulating
additives,17 at a total concentration higher
than C ∼ 100 g/L.17 Of this, >60 g/L consist of the conductive filler needed to achieve
high σ ∼ 107 S/m.20,21 In 2016, the average cost of Ag was ∼$550/kg,22 that of Au ∼$40,000/kg,22 while Cu was cheaper at ∼$4.7/kg.23 Although metal oxidation issues under ambient conditions
have been addressed as indicated in refs (6 and 24), metal electrodes can degrade the device performance, by chemically
reacting with photoactive layers (Cu25)
or by migrating into device layers (Cu,26 Ag27) . It was also reported that they
might cause water toxicity,28 cytotoxicity,29 genotoxicity,30 and
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage.31 The
average cost of graphite in 2016 was ∼$1/kg,32 however, carbon-based inks are not typically used to print
electrodes in OPVs or RFIDs, due to their low σ ∼ 2–4
× 103 S/m,33−35 which corresponds to a Rs ∼ 20 to 10Ω/□ for a 25
μm film. Thus, there is a need for cheap, stable, and nontoxic
conductive materials.

Graphene is a promising alternative conductive
filler.36 Graphite can be exfoliated via sonication using solvents37−42 or water/surfactant solutions.40,43 Dispersions
of single layer graphene (SLG) flakes can be produced at concentrations
∼0.01g/L37 with a yield by weight Yw ∼ 1%,37 where Yw is defined as the ratio between the weight
of dispersed material and that of the starting graphite flakes.44 Dispersions of few layer graphene (FLG) flakes
(<4 nm) can be achieved with C ∼ 0.1 g/L45 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)
and ∼0.2 g/L in water.40 The low Yw ∼ 1–2%40,45 for FLG prepared by bath sonication is due to the fact that a significant
amount of graphite remains unexfoliated, as the ultrasonic intensity
(i.e., the energy transmitted per
unit time and unit area46) is not uniformly
applied46,47 and depends on the design and location of
the ultrasonic transducers.47 In tip sonication,
the ultrasound intensity decays exponentially with distance from the
tip48 and is dissipated at distances as
low as ∼1 cm.48 Therefore, only
a small volume near the tip is processed.49 Refs (50 and 51) reported ∼2 nm thick flakes with
a lateral size ∼70 × 70 nm2 and C ∼ 0.2 g/L with Yw = 1% by tip
sonication. In order to formulate screen printing inks,51 the flakes C was increased
from 0.2 g/L to 80 g/L via repetitive centrifugation
(4 times) and redispersion (3 times) processes, resulting in an increased
preparation time. Ref (52) used a rotor-stator mixer to exfoliate graphite, reaching C < 0.1 g/L of FLGs with Yw < 2 × 10–3. Yw is low because in mixers, a high shear rate, γ̇, (i.e., the velocity gradient in a flowing
material)53 is localized in the rotor-stator
gap52,54 and is ∼2 × 104 to
1 × 105 s–1, dropping by a factor
∼100 outside it.54 Ref (55) reported the production
of FLGs with number of layers N < 5 and Yw > 70% through electrochemical expansion
of
graphite in lithium perchlorate/propylene carbonate. The process required
3 cycles of electrochemical charging followed by >10 h of sonication
and several washing steps (with hydrochloric acid/dimethylformamide,
ammonia, water, isopropanol, and tetrahydrofuran) to remove the salts.
A method with less processing steps and high Yw (ideally 100%) remains a challenge.

Microfluidization
is a homogenization technique whereby high pressure
(up to 207 MPa)56 is applied to a fluid,
forcing it to pass through a microchannel (diameter, d < 100 μm), as shown in Figure 1 and discussed in Methods. The key advantage over sonication and shear-mixing is that high
γ̇ > 106 s–1 is applied
to
the whole fluid volume,57,58 not just locally. Microfluidization
was used for the production of polymer nanosuspensions56 in pharmaceutical applications to produce liposome
nanoparticles to be used in eye drops59 and aspirin nanoemulsions60 as well as
in food applications for oil-in-water nanoemulsions.61 Microfluidization was also used for the deagglomeration
and dispersion of carbon nanotubes.62

Figure 1 Schematic
of the microfluidization process. Graphite flakes in
SDC/water are added in the inlet reservoir. An intensifier pump applies
high pressure (up to ∼207 MPa) and forces the suspension to
pass through the microchannel of the interaction chamber where intense
γ̇ ∼ 108s–1 is generated.
The processed material is cooled and collected from the outlet reservoir.
The process can be repeated several times.

Here, we report the production of FLG flakes with Yw ∼ 100% by microfluidization. The dispersion
is
stabilized at a C up to ∼100 g/L using carboxymethylcellulose
sodium salt (CMC) (C = 10g/L). 4% of the resulting
flakes are <4 nm, and 96% are in the 4 to 70 nm thickness range.
The stabilized dispersion is used for blade coating and screen printing. Rs of blade coated films after thermal annealing
(300 °C-40 min) reaches 2Ω/□ at 25 μm (σ
= 2 × 104S/m), suitable for electrodes in devices
such as OPVs,12,63 organic thin-film transistors
(OTFTs),64 or RFIDs.13 The inks are then deposited on glass and paper substrates
using blade coating and screen printing to demonstrate the viability
for these applications (OPVs, OTFTs, RFIDs).

Results
and Discussion
We use Timrex KS25 graphite flakes as a starting
material. They
are selected because their size is suitable for flow in microchannels
∼87 μm wide (90% are <27.2 μm).65 Larger flakes would cause blockages. The flakes are used
in conjunction with sodium deoxycholate (SDC) (Aldrich). SDC is first
mixed in deionized (DI) water (σ = 5.5 × 10–6 S/m), and the flakes are then added and treated with a microfluidic
processor with a Z-type geometry interaction chamber (M-110P, Microfluidics), Figure 1. Mixtures are processed
at the maximum pressure for this system (∼207 MPa), with varying
process cycles (1–100). The temperature, T [°C], increases from 20 to 55 °C after the liquid passes
through the interaction chamber. A cooling system then reduces it
to ∼20 °C. This is important, otherwise T will keep increasing and the solvent will boil. Graphite/SDC mixtures
with increasing graphite C (1–100 g/L) and
9 g/L SDC in DI water are processed over multiple cycles (1, 5, 10,
20, 30, 50, 70, 100). One cycle is defined as a complete pass through
the interaction chamber.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(Figure 2a) is used
to assess the lateral size of
the starting flakes and of exfoliated flakes after 5, 20, and 100
cycles. Dispersions are diluted (1000 times, from 50 g/L to 0.05 g/L)
to avoid aggregation after they are drop cast onto Si/SiO2. The samples are further washed with five drops of a mixture of
water and ethanol (50:50 in volume) to remove the surfactant. Three
different magnifications are used. For each, images are taken at 10
positions across each sample. A statistical analysis of over 80 particles
(Figure 2b) of the
starting graphite reveals a lateral size (defined as the longest dimension)
up to ∼32 μm. Following microfluidization, this reduces,
accompanied by a narrowing of the flake distribution. After 100 cycles
(Figure 2c), the mean
flake size is ∼1 μm.

(b) Histograms of lateral
flake size for the starting material and after 5, 20, and 100 cycles.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is performed after 20 and 100
cycles
to determine the h and aspect ratio (AR = lateral
size/h) using a Dimension Icon (Bruker). After 20
cycles, Figures 3a,b
show flakes with d ∼ 1.7 μm and h = 25 nm and d = 1.9 μm with h = 8.5 nm, while Figures 3c,d show ∼1 nm flakes, consistent with N up to 3. AFM statistics of h and AR are
also performed. Three samples, ∼60 μL, are collected
from each dispersion (20 and 100 cycles) and drop cast onto 1 cm ×
1 cm Si/SiO2 substrates. These are further washed with
five drops of a mixture of water and ethanol (50:50 in volume) to
remove the surfactant. AFM scans are performed at 5 different locations
on the substrate with each scan spanning an area of ∼20 μm
× 20 μm. For each processing condition, we measure 150
flakes. After 20 cycles, h shows a log-normal distribution66 peaked at ∼10 nm (Figure 4a), with a mean value of ∼19 nm. After
100 cycles (Figure 4a), the distribution is shifted towards a lower h, with a maximum at ∼7.4 nm, a mean h ∼
12 nm (4% of the flakes are <4 nm and 96% are between 4 and 70
nm). Figure 4b shows
that AR increases with processing cycles from ∼41 for 20 cycles
to ∼59 for 100.

cross section profiles. (c) Flakes with h = 1 nm
and (d) corresponding cross section.

The crystalline structure
of individual flakes is investigated
after 100 cycles (no significant difference is observed between samples
of different processing cycles) by performing scanning electron diffraction
(SED)67 using a Philips CM300 field emission
gun transmission electron microscope operated at 50 kV fitted with
a NanoMegas Digistar system.68 This enables
the simultaneous scan and acquisition of diffraction patterns with
an external optical charge-coupled device (CCD) camera imaging the
phosphor viewing screen of the microscope. Using SED, small angle
convergent beam electron diffraction patterns are acquired at every
position as the electron beam is scanned over 10 flakes with a step
size of 10.6 nm. Local crystallographic variations are visualized
by plotting the diffracted intensity in a selected subset of pixels
in each diffraction pattern as a function of probe position to form
so-called “virtual dark-field” images.67,69Figures 5a,c,e,g
show the virtual dark-field images and Figures 5b,d,f,h, the corresponding diffraction patterns
with integration windows marked. These show regions contributing to
the selected Bragg reflection and therefore indicate local variations
in the crystal structure and orientation. Consistent with selected
area electron diffraction (SAED), three broad classes of flakes are
observed, comprising: (a,b) single crystals, (c,d) polycrystals of
numerous (>5) small crystals, and (e−h) polycrystals of
few
(<5) larger crystals. This shows that there is heterogeneity between
individual flakes and that after 100 cycles a significant fraction
(∼70%) are polycrystalline.

images and (b,d,f,h) representative
diffraction patterns acquired from (a,b) a single crystal flake, (c,d)
a polycrystalline flake, and (e-h) a polycrystalline flake comprising
three crystals overlapping one another. The scale bar is 1 μm.
Red circles indicate the integration windows used to form the virtual
dark-field images.

It is important to assess
any chemical changes, such as oxidation
or other covalent functionalization, that might occur during processing,
since unwanted basal plane functionalization may lead to a deterioration
in electronic performance.70 Flakes produced
after 100 cycles are washed by filtration to remove SDC prior to thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For this
washing procedure, 10 mL isopropanol is added to a 5 mL dispersion
to precipitate the flakes. The resulting mixture is passed through
a 70 mm diameter filter and rinsed with 500 mL of DI water followed
by 500 mL of ethanol. The powder is dried under vacuum and scraped
from the filter paper. Inert atmosphere (nitrogen) TGA is performed
to identify adsorbed or covalently bonded functional groups using
a TA Q50 (TA Instruments). Samples are heated from 25 to 100 °C
at 10 °C/min and then held isothermally at 100 °C for 10
min to remove residual moisture. T is then ramped
up to 1000 °C at a typical heating rate of 10 °C/min.71 The starting graphite shows ∼2 wt % decomposition
above 700 °C. Flakes after washing reveal no surfactant, as confirmed
by no weight loss at ∼400 °C, where SDC suffers significant
decomposition, as shown in Figure 6a. However, thermal decomposition of the flakes occurs
at ∼600 °C, lower than the starting graphite, with a weight
loss of ∼6 wt %. Flakes with small lateral dimensions and thickness
have a lower thermal stability compared to large-area graphitic sheets.73,74

d) High-resolution C1s spectra of starting graphite and
after 100 cycles. Red curves represent the Shirley-type72 background, which accounts for the effect of
the inelastic scattering of electrons.

The starting graphite and the exfoliated flakes are then
fixed
onto an adhesive Cu tape for XPS (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo Scientific).75 The binding energies are adjusted to the sp2 C1s peak of graphite at 284.5 eV.76−78 Survey scan spectra (Figure 6b) of the starting graphite and the exfoliated flakes reveal
only C1s and O1s76 peaks. The slight increase in oxygen content for the exfoliated
flakes compared to the starting material (C1s/O1s 35.1 to 25.9) is likely due to the increased ratio of edge to basal
plane sites as the flake lateral size decreases. However, C1s/O1s remains an order of magnitude larger than the ∼3
typically observed in graphene oxide (GO).79−81 Even following
reductive treatments, the C1s/O1s ratio in reduced
graphene oxide does not exceed ∼15,79,80i.e., half that measured for our
flakes. High-energy resolution (50 eV pass energy) scans are then
performed in order to deconvolute the C1s lineshapes. Both
the starting graphite and exfoliated flakes can be fitted with 3 components
(Figure 6c,d): an asymmetric
sp2 C–C (284.5 eV),76,78 C–O
(∼285–286 eV),78 and π–π*
transitions at ∼290 eV.78 Only a
slight increase in the relative area of the C–O peak is seen
(from ∼2% to ∼5%). Therefore excessive oxidation or
additional unwanted chemical functionalizations do not occur during
microfluidization.

Raman spectroscopy is then used to assess
the structural quality
of the flakes. 60 μL of aqueous dispersion is drop cast onto
1 cm × 1 cm Si/SiO2 substrates, then heated at 80–100
°C for 20 min, to ensure water evaporation, and washed with a
mixture of water and ethanol (50:50 in volume) to remove SDC. Raman
spectra are acquired at 457, 514, and 633 nm using a Renishaw InVia
spectrometer equipped with a 50× objective. The power on the
sample is kept below 1 mW to avoid any possible damage. The spectral
resolution is ∼1 cm–1. A statistical analysis
is performed on the starting graphite and on samples processed for
20, 50, 70, and 100 cycles. The spectra are collected by using a motorized
stage as follows: The substrate is divided into 9 equally spaced regions
∼200 × 200 μm2. In each, 3 points are
acquired. This procedure is repeated for each sample and for the 3
wavelengths. The Raman spectrum of graphite has several characteristic
peaks. The G peak corresponds to the high-frequency E2g phonon at Γ.82 The D peak is due to the breathing modes of six-atom rings
and requires a defect for its activation.83 It comes from transverse optical (TO) phonons around the Brillouin
zone corner K.82,83 It is active by double resonance
(DR)84,85 and is strongly dispersive with excitation
energy86 due to a Kohn anomaly (KA) at
K.87 DR can also happen as an intravalley
process, i.e., connecting two points
belonging to the same cone around K (or K′). This gives the
so-called D′ peak. The 2D peak is the D peak overtone, and
the 2D′ peak is the D′ overtone. Because the 2D and
2D′ peaks originate from a process where momentum conservation
is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wave vectors, no defects
are required for their activation and are thus always present.88−90 The 2D peak is a single Lorentzian in SLG, whereas it splits in
several components as N increases, reflecting the
evolution of the electronic band structure.88 In bulk graphite, it consists of two components, ∼1/4 and
1/2 the height of the G peak.88 In disordered
carbons, the position of the G peak, Pos(G), increases with decreasing
of excitation wavelength (λL),91 resulting in a nonzero G peak dispersion, Disp(G), defined
as the rate of change of Pos(G) with excitation wavelength. Disp(G)
increases with disorder.91 Analogously
to Disp(G), the full width at half-maximum of the G peak, FWHM(G),
increases with disorder.92 The analysis
of the intensity ratio of the D to G peaks, I(D)/I(G), combined with that of FWHM(G) and Disp(G), allows
one to discriminate between disorder localized at the edges and in
the bulk. In the latter case, a higher I(D)/I(G) would correspond to higher FWHM(G) and Disp(G). Figure 7a plots representative
spectra of the starting graphite (black line) and of flakes after
20 (red line), 50 (blue line), 70 (green line), and 100 cycles (gray
line). The 2D band line shape for the starting graphite and the 20–70
cycle samples show two components (2D2, 2D1).
Their intensity ratio, I(2D2)/I(2D1), changes from ∼1.5 for starting
graphite to ∼1.2 for 50 and 70 cycles, until the 2D peak becomes
a single Lorentzian for 100 cycles, suggesting an evolution to electronically
decoupled layers.90,93 FWHM(2D) for 100 cycles is ∼70
cm–1, significantly larger than in pristine graphene.
This implies that, even if the flakes are multilayers, they are electronically
decoupled and, to a first approximation, behave as a collection of
single layers. Pos(G) (Figure 7b), FWHM(G) (Figure 7c), and I(D)/I(G) (Figure 7d) for 20–70
cycles do not show a significant difference with respect to the starting
graphite. However, for 100 cycles, Pos(G), FWHM(G), and I(D)/I(G) increase up to ∼1588 cm–1, 34 cm–1, and 3.2, suggesting a more disordered
material. For all the processed samples (20–100), the D peak
is present. For 20–70 cycles, it mostly arises from edges,
as supported by the absence of correlation between I(D)/I(G), Disp(G) (Figure 7e), and FWHM(G) (Figure 7f). The correlation between I(D)/I(G), Disp(G) (Figure 7e), and FWHM(G) (Figure 7f) for 100 cycles indicates that D peak arises
not only from edges but also from in-plane defects. Therefore, we
select 70 cycles to formulate conductive printable inks. We note that
here we use synthetic microcrystalline graphite flakes instead of
large natural or single crystal flakes sometimes used by other LPE-based
works.37,52,55,94,95 Our flakes produced
up to 70 cycles are of comparable quality, as shown by Raman spectroscopy.

Printable Inks Formulation
Following
microfluidization,
carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) (weight-average molecular
weight, MW = 700.000, Aldrich no. 419338),
a biopolymer96 which is a rheology modifier,97,98 is added to the dispersion to stabilize the flakes against sedimentation.
CMC is added at C = 10 g/L over a period of 3 h at
room temperature. This is necessary because if all of the CMC is added
at once, aggregation occurs, and these aggregates are very difficult
to dissolve. The mixture is continuously stirred until complete dissolution.
Different inks are prepared, keeping constant the SDC C = 9 g/L and CMC C = 10 g/L, while increasing the
flakes C to 1, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, and 100 g/L. Once
printed and dried, these formulations correspond to 5, 35, 51, 61,
73, 81, and 84 wt % of flakes in the total solids content, respectively.

The rheological properties are investigated using a Discovery HR-1
rheometer (TA Instruments) in a parallel-plate (40 mm diameter) configuration.99 We monitor the elastic modulus G′ [J/m3 = Pa], representing the energy density
stored by the material under shear,100 and
the loss modulus G″ [J/m3 = Pa],100 representing the energy density lost during
a shear process due to friction and internal motions.100 Flow curves are measured by increasing γ̇
from 1 to 1000 s–1 at a gap of 0.5 mm, because this
γ̇ range is applied during screen printing.101Figure 8a plots the steady-state μ of an ink containing 73 wt
% flakes (70 cycles) as a function of γ̇. CMC imparts
a drop in μ under shear, from 570 mPa·s at 100 s–1 to 140 mPa·s at 1000 s–1. This is a thixotropic
behavior,102 since the μ reduces
with γ̇. The higher γ̇, the lower μ.102 This behavior is shown by some non-Newtonian
fluids, such as polymer solutions103 and
biological fluids.104 It is caused by the
disentanglement of polymer coils or by the increased orientation of
polymer coils in the direction of the flow.102 On the other hand, in Newtonian liquids the viscosity does not change
with γ̇.104 Refs (105 and 106) reported that thixotropy in CMC solutions arises from the presence
of unsubstituted (free) OH groups. Thixotropy increases as the number
of OH groups increases.105,106

as a function of γ̇ for an ink

s–1 for different flakes wt %. (c, d) G′,G″, and tan δ as a function
of (c) wt % flakes and (d) processing cycles.

During printing, shear is applied to the ink, and its μ
decreases,
making the ink easier to print or coat. This shear thinning behavior
facilitates the use of the ink in techniques such as screen printing,
in which a maximum γ̇ ∼ 1000 s–1 is reached when the ink penetrates the screen mesh.101Figure 8b plots μ at 100 s–1 as a function
of wt % flakes (70 process cycles). The CMC polymer (10 g/L in water)
has μ ∼ 0.56 Pa·s at 100 s−1 and
drops to 0.43 Pa·s for C = 1 g/L, i.e. 5 wt % flakes in the solids content. The flakes wt % affects μ,
which reaches 0.6 Pa·s at 80 wt %.

More information on
the ink rheological behavior and microstructure
can be obtained by oscillatory rheology measurements.107 CMC gives a viscoelastic character to the ink.
This can also be evaluated in terms of the loss factor, defined as
tan δ = G″/G′.100 The lower tan δ, the more solid-like
(i.e., elastic) the material is
at a given strain or frequency.100Figure 8c plots G′, G″, and tan δ at 1% strain,
checked from dynamic amplitude sweeps in order to be within the linear
viscoelastic region (LVR). In LVR, G′ and G″ are not stress or strain dependent108 as a function of flake loading. The addition
of 5 wt % flakes in CMC decreases both G′
and G″, which start to increase for loadings
above 30 wt %. Tan δ decreases with flake loading, leading to
a more solid-like behavior. We estimate G′, G″, and tan δ also for inks containing flakes
processed at different cycles, while keeping the flakes loading at
∼73%, Figure 8d. Both G′ and G″
increase with processing cycles, while tan δ decreases, indicating
an increase of elastic behavior with processing.

For simplicity,
blade coating is used to compare ink formulations.
Inks are blade coated onto glass microscope slides (25 × 75 mm)
using a spacer to control h. The films are dried
at 100 °C for 10 min to remove water. The h depends
on the wet film thickness, the total solid content wt % of the ink,
and the number of processing cycles. We investigate the effects of
processing cycles, flake content, and postdeposition annealing on Rs. This is measured in four different locations
per sample using a four-point probe. A profilometer (DektakXT, Bruker)
is used to determine h for each point. In order to
test the effect of the processing cycles, films are prepared from
inks containing ∼73 wt % flakes processed for 0, 5, 10, 30,
50, 70, and 100 cycles keeping the wet h constant
(1 mm). Figure 9a shows
the effect of processing cycles on Rs and h. Without any processing, the films have Rs ∼ 77Ω/□ and h =
35.8 μm, corresponding to σ ∼ 3.6 × 102 S/m. Microfluidization causes a drop in Rs and h. Ten cycles are enough to reach
∼10Ω/□ and h ∼ 25.6 μm,
corresponding to σ ∼ 3.9 × 103S/m. Rs does not change significantly between 10 and
100 cycles, while h slightly decreases. We get σ
∼ 4.5 × 102 S/m above 30 cycles.

Figure 9 (a) Rs and h as a
function of processing cycles for a formulation with ∼73 wt
% flakes. (b) Rs as a function of h for different wt % (70 cycles). (c) σ as a function
of h for different wt %. (d) Bulk σ and critical
h as a function of wt % (70 cycles). All samples are dried for 10
min at 100 °C.

The effect of flake loading
for a fixed number of processing cycles
(70) is investigated as follows. Dispersions with different loadings
are prepared by increasing the flakes C between 1
and 100g/L, while keeping the SDC (9g/L) and CMC (10g/L) constant.
Films of different h are prepared by changing the
spacer height during blade coating, leading to different wet and dry h. Rs and σ as a function
of h are shown in Figures 9b,c. At ∼ 34.5 wt % the flakes already
form a percolative network within the CMC matrix, and σ ∼
15–20 S/m is achieved (σ of cellulose derivative films
is <10–8 S/m).109Figure 9c shows that, for
a given composition, there is a critical h below
which σ is thickness dependent. Above this, the bulk σ
is reached. As shown in Figure 9c, for ∼80 wt % we get σ ∼ 7.7 ×
103 S/m for h > 4.5 μm. Higher
loadings
(84 wt %) do not increase σ further. Figure 9d indicates that the critical h, where the bulk σ is reached, drops from ∼20 μm
for 51 wt % to ∼4.5 μm for 80 wt %. Coatings with h > 4.5 μm can be easily achieved using screen
printing
in a single printing pass. Figure 9c shows that σ is h dependent
up to a critical point. In order to understand the effect of h on σ, we adapt the percolation model of ref (110). The total area covered
by nonoverlapping flakes is Af (e.g., for elliptical flakes Af = mπab, where m is the number of flakes and a [m] and b [m] are their half axes lengths). The fractional area
covered by the (overlapping) flakes, with respect to the total area S[m2], can be evaluated as q = 1 – p, with p = e–Af/S,
where q is the fractional area covered by the flakes;110q coincides with Af/S only when the flakes do not overlap.
Denoting by Afhf, the total flakes volume and f the volume fraction
of flakes in the films we have 1  and σ follows a power
law behavior110: 2  around the percolation threshold qc,110 with n as the electrical conductivity critical
exponent above
percolation. Eqs 1 and 2 give 3  where σ∞=ke(−fnhc/hf) and hc is the critical
thickness corresponding to zero σ. As a function of h, σ is fitted
with eq 3 in Figure 10 for ∼73
wt %, i.e., f =
0.61, giving σ∞ ∼ 4.3 × 103 S/m, hc = 0.39 μm, hf ∼ 7.58 μm, and n = 0.39.

Figure 10 Fit of σ as a function of h according to eq 3 for 73 wt % of flakes
in the film.

Figure 11 shows
SEM images of the coatings comprising the starting graphite (Figure 11a) and after 1
(Figure 11b), 5 (Figure 11c), and 100 cycles
(Figure 11d). Flake
size reduction and platelet-like morphology are observed after the
first cycle, Figure 11b. The samples have fewer voids compared to the starting graphite,
providing higher interparticle contact area and higher packing density,
consistent with the h reduction (Figure 9a) and the increased σ.
While the packing density increase results in more pathways for conduction,
the smaller flake size increases the number of interparticle contacts.
Then, Rs remains constant.

taken from coatings comprising (a) starting graphite,
(b) after 1 cycle, (c) after 5 cycles, and (d) after 100 cycles. The
scale bar is 5 μm.

Postdeposition annealing is studied in blade-coated films
for ∼80
wt % flakes after 70 cycles. Figure 12a plots σ as a function of T. A three-step regime can be seen. In the first (100–180 °C),
σ is constant (∼7.7 × 103S/m), and above
180 °C, it increases, reaching 9 × 103 S/m at
260 °C, followed by a significant increase at 285 °C to
∼1.5 × 104 S/m. Figure 12b shows the effect of annealing time at
260, 285, or 300 °C. Either higher T or longer
annealing times are required to increase σ.

Figure 12 Plots of σ as
a function of (a) T and (b)
time. (c) TGA thermograms from coatings compared with the SDC (powder)
and the CMC (powder) components.

TGA is then used to investigate the thermal stability of
the films
(Figure 12c). The
thermogram of the CMC polymer reveals a 10% weight loss up to 200
°C, due to water loss.111Figure 12 also shows that
50% of the CMC is decomposed at 285 °C, while the SDC surfactant
remains intact. Annealing at 300 °C for 40 min leads to films
with Rs ∼ 2Ω/□ (25
μm), corresponding to σ ∼ 2 × 104 S/m. This σ is remarkable, given the absence of centrifugation,
usually performed to remove the nonexfoliated material, or washing
steps to remove the nonconductive polymer and surfactant materials.
The SDC additive stabilizes the flakes against restacking through
electrostatic repulsion, forming a large contact area per surfactant
molecule.40 CMC further stabilizes against
restacking through electrosteric repulsion.112 Thus, Rs of our patterns is <2Ω/□,
surpassing other reported printable graphene inks.94,113−115 Our inks also could be exploited to prepare
transparent conductive films, by using grids, e.g., a grid with line width ∼100 μm and a pitch
distance ∼2000 μm would give ∼90% transparency,
combined with low Rs ∼ 100Ω/□
at a thickness of 10 μm.

The printability of the ink with
∼80 wt % flakes after 70
cycles is tested using a semiautomatic flatbed screen printer (Kippax
kpx 2012) and a Natgraph screen printer (Figure13a), both equipped with screens with 120
mesh count per inch. Figure 13b shows a 29 × 29 cm2 print on paper with
a line resolution ∼100 μm (Figure 13c). The pattern (Figure 13b) can be used as a capacitive touch pad
in a sound platform that translates touch into audio.116 The electronic module has a series of 12 contact
pads (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) on its underside that are interfaced to
printed electronic pads on the paper surface. This maintains a set-point
charge on each of the printed capacitive touch pads. When a touch-pad
is touched, it undergoes an instantaneous discharge that is then identified
by the electronics, and a corresponding sound is played. We measured
the normalized resistance (resistance after bending/resistance prior
to bending) for up to 1400 cycles for a bending radius of 12.5 mm
and observed a change <1%.

Conclusion
We
report a simple and scalable route to exfoliate graphite. The
resulting material can be used without any additional steps (washing
or centrifugation) to formulate highly conductive inks with adjustable
viscosity for high-throughput printing. A conductivity of 2 ×
104 S/m was demonstrated. Our approach enables the mass
production of chemically unmodified flakes that can be used in inks,
coatings, and conductive composites for a wide range of applications.

Methods
Microfluidization Process
In order to compare the microfluidization
process with sonication or shear mixing, it is important to elucidate
its fluid dynamics. The mean velocity U [m/s] of
the fluid inside the microchannel is117 4  where Q [m3/s]
is the volumetric flow rate, defined as118 5  where cn is the number of cycles, V [m3] the volume of material (graphite and solvent)
passing a point per
unit time t [s], and A [m2] is the channel cross-sectional area, given by 6  where Dh = 4A/P is the hydraulic diameter of the microchannel,
with P the wetted perimeter (i.e., the part of the microchannel in contact with the flowing
fluid117). For a batch of 0.18 L, it takes
1.93 h to complete 70 cycles. Eq 5 gives Q = 1.8 × 10–6 m3/s. Eq 6 with Dh ∼ 87 μm58 gives A = 5940 × 10–12 m2. Then, from eq 4 we get U ∼ 304m/s.

The Reynolds number, Re, can be used to determine
the type of flow, and it is given by117 7  where ρ [kg/m3] is the liquid
density. We typically use 50 up to 100 g/L of graphite, which corresponds
to a total density (mixture of graphite and water) of 1026–1052
kg/m3; μ [Pa·s] is the (dynamic)
viscosity (μ = τ/γ̇, where τ [Pa] is
the shear stress). We measure μ with a rotational rheometer
in which a known γ̇ is applied to the sample, and the
resultant torque (or τ) is measured.99 We get μ ∼ 1 × 10–3 Pa·s
(20 °C), similar to water.117 Thus, eq 7 gives Re ∼ 2.7 × 104, which indicates that there is
a fully developed turbulent flow inside the microchannel (there is
a transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the 2000 > Re > 4000 range).119

The pressure losses inside the channel can be estimated by the
Darcy–Weisbach equation,117 which
relates the pressure drop, due to friction along a given length of
pipe, to the average velocity of the fluid flow for an incompressible
fluid:117 8  where Δp [Pa] is the
pressure drop, L [m] is the pipe length, and fD is the Darcy friction factor, a dimensionless
quantity used for the description of friction losses in pipe flow.117The energy dissipation rate per unit mass ε
[m2/s3] inside the channel can be written as120 9  where Vc is the
volume of the liquid inside the microchannel. From eqs 8 and 9, we
can rewrite ε as 10  For Re = 2.7 × 104, we get fD ∼ 0.052 from
the Moody chart,121 which links fD, Re, and the relative roughness
of the pipe (= absolute roughness/hydraulic diameter117). From eqs 4, 5, 6, and 10, we get ε ∼ 8.5 × 109 m2/s3, and γ̇ can then be estimated
as122 11  where ν [m2/s]
is the kinematic
viscosity,122 defined as ν = μ/ρ
∼ 1 × 10–6 m2/s. From eq 11, we get γ̇
∼ 108 s–1, which is 4 orders of
magnitude higher than that required to initiate graphite exfoliation.52 Then, the exfoliation in the microfluidizer
is primarily due to shear stress generated by the turbulent flow.
In comparison, in a rotor-stator shear mixer, lower γ̇
∼ 2 × 104 to 1 × 105 s–1 are achieved54,122,123 and only near the probe.54 Thus, exfoliation
does not take place in the entire batch uniformly.52 On the contrary, in a microfluidizer all the material is
uniformly exposed to high shear forces.62

Turbulent mixing is characterized by a near dissipationless
cascade
of energy,122i.e., the energy is transferred from large (on the order of
the size of the flow geometry considered) random, three-dimensional
eddy-type motions to smaller ones (on the order of the size of a fluid
particle).117 This takes place from the
inertial subrange (IS) of turbulence where inertial stresses dominate
over viscous stresses, down to the Kolmogorov length,124 η [m], i.e., the length-scale above which the system is in the IS and below
which it is in the viscous subrange (VS), where turbulence energy
is dissipated by heat,122,125 and η can be
calculated as124 12  From ν ∼ 1 × 10–6 m2/s and eq 9, we get
η ∼ 103 nm for microfluidization in water.
Since our starting graphitic particles are much larger (>μm)
than η, exfoliation occurs in the IS rather than VS. In comparison,
in a kitchen blender η = 6 μm,126 thus exfoliation occurs in the VS, i.e., the energy is dissipated through viscous losses, rather than through
particle disruption. During microfluidization, in the IS, the main
stress contributing to exfoliation is due to pressure fluctuations, i.e., the graphite is bombarded with turbulent
eddies. This stress, τIS [Pa], can be estimated as122 13  where dg is the diameter of a sphere
of equivalent volume to the flakes.
For dg = 0.1 to 27 μm,
τIS is in the ∼0.1–4 MPa range. The
dynamic pressure also breaks the flakes as well as exfoliating them.
For length scales <η, we are in the VS, and the stress applied
on the fakes, τVS, can be estimated as122 14  which gives τVS ∼
0.1 MPa. Thus, the stresses applied on the flakes in the IS are much
higher than in the VS, where energy is lost by heat. This can lead
to more defects in the basal plane. The Kolmogorov length can be tuned, eq 12, by either increasing
the kinematic viscosity of the dispersion or decreasing the energy
dissipation rate, thus extending the viscous subrange of turbulence
realizing a milder exfoliation.

In microfluidization, the energy
density, E/V [J/m3],
(where E [J] is the
energy) equates the pressure differential,61 due to very short residence times ∼10–4 s,61i.e., the time the liquid spends in the microchannel. Therefore, for
a processing pressure ∼207 MPa, E/V = 207 MPa = 2.07 × 108 J/m3. For this total energy input per unit volume, the flakes production
rate Pr = VC/t [g/h] for a typical batch of V = 0.18
L and t = 1.93h (for 70 cycles) is Pr ∼ 9.3 g/h, with starting graphite concentration
∼100 g/L using a lab-scale system. Scale-up can be achieved
by increasing Q, using a number of parallel microchannels,58 which decreases the time required to process
a given V and cn (eq 5). With shorter time, Pr increases. Large-scale microfluidizers can
achieve flow rates ∼12 L/min58 at
processing pressure ∼207 MPa, which correspond to Pr = CQ/cn ∼ 1 kg/h
(∼9 ton per year, ∼90,000 L of ink per year) in an industrial
system using 70 process cycles and C = 100 g/L.
