Nanovesicles (∼100 nm) are ubiquitous in cell biology and
an important vector for drug delivery. Mechanical properties of vesicles
are known to influence cellular uptake, but the mechanism by which
deformation dynamics affect internalization is poorly understood.
This is partly due to the fact that experimental studies of the mechanics
of such vesicles remain challenging, particularly at the nanometer
scale where appropriate theoretical models have also been lacking.
Here, we probe the mechanical properties of nanoscale liposomes using
atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation. The mechanical response
of the nanovesicles shows initial linear behavior and subsequent flattening
corresponding to inward tether formation. We derive a quantitative
model, including the competing effects of internal pressure and membrane
bending, that corresponds well to these experimental observations.
Our results are consistent with a bending modulus of the lipid bilayer
of ∼14kbT. Surprisingly,
we find that vesicle stiffness is pressure dominated for adherent
vesicles under physiological conditions. Our experimental method and
quantitative theory represents a robust approach to study the mechanics
of nanoscale vesicles, which are abundant in biology, as well as being
of interest for the rational design of liposomal vectors for drug
delivery.

==== Body
Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs:
∼0.1 μm) perform multiple vital roles in biology. Prime
examples of SUVs in cell biology include synaptic vesicles,1 viral envelopes,2 and
extracellular vesicles for cell-to-cell communication.3 In addition, synthetic liposomes of this size are currently
used as nanocarriers for drug delivery and developments for further
applications continue.4,5 Mechanical properties of natural
and synthetic vesicles and nanoparticles are reported to influence
their uptake by cells,6−11 a phenomenon that is also supported by theoretical models.12,13 Moreover, the mechanical stability of vesicles is a key limitation
of their application for drug delivery.4 Consequently, multiple approaches have been developed to stabilize
them.14,15 Therefore, understanding the underlying
mechanics of such vesicles is crucial for both understanding biological
function and developing effective drug delivery strategies.

Although SUVs are an important class of vesicles, measurement of
their mechanical properties is still challenging. The vast majority
of previous studies of the mechanical properties of vesicles have
been performed on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs: ∼10 μm).
The techniques used for studying GUVs, e.g., micropipette aspiration
and optical imaging of shape fluctuations,16,17 are developed for these large vesicles and are less suitable for
SUVs.16,17 Instead, for mechanical studies of small
vesicles, nanoscale indentations using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
have been employed.18−22 However, from these experiments no consistent picture has emerged
regarding the underlying mechanical properties. This is partly due
to the fact that these nanoindentation studies of SUVs, in contrast
to studies of GUVs,16,17 have generally been interpreted
using elasticity models with finite shear moduli, which are inappropriate
for fluid bilayers that lack a shear modulus. Moreover, the potential
influence of pressure has not been considered.

Here, we present an AFM-based approach to quantify the mechanical
properties of small fluid vesicles as well as a model that captures
their mechanical response. We performed imaging and nanoindentation
measurements on single SUVs of 30–100 nm radius. For accurate
measurements of vesicle size and shape we introduced corrections for
tip dilation and deformation caused by imaging forces. The mechanical
properties were investigated by performing nanoindentations with various
AFM tip sizes. In parallel, we developed a model to describe nanoindentation
of vesicles, which takes the fluidity of the membrane into account.
We then quantitatively compared various aspects of the model with
the experimental data, ultimately allowing us to estimate the contributions
of bending and pressure to the vesicle stiffness. With the combination
of AFM experiments and development of a theoretical model we both
deepen the understanding of the mechanics of SUVs and we lay out a
framework for more accurate measurements of mechanical properties
of SUVs.

Results
Size and Shape Measurement of Nanovesicles
First, we
imaged vesicles to determine their geometry (Figure 1a). Vesicles of complex lipid mixture, obtained
by extrusion through 200 nm filters, were attached to a 0.001% poly l-lysine coated surface in PBS. Upon adhesion, we observed spreading
of the initially spherical vesicles (Figure 1b). The expected resultant shape of an adherent
vesicle is a spherical cap,23 allowing
determination of the radius of curvature of vesicles (Rc) by subtracting the tip radius (Figure S1). However, soft samples, such as these vesicles,
can be affected by forces applied during AFM imaging. To determine
the extent of this effect we imaged many 100 nm extruded vesicles
at various force set points and noticed that their apparent height
and especially width were underestimated already at low imaging forces
(Figure 1c). To avoid
underestimation of the height of vesicles we can use the zero force
contact point from indentations (HFDC),
which shows that vesicles are 11 ± 1 nm (standard error of the
mean (s.e.m.), number of measurements, each of which obtained on a
separate vesicle (N) = 46) higher than the apparent
height obtained from images for 200 nm vesicles (Figure S1). We used a subsequent correction for the radius
of curvature, which is based on geometric arguments (Figure S1) and the experimental data in Figure 1c, to obtain the vesicle geometry and size.
This analysis showed that the adhered liposomes adopt approximately
hemispherical shapes (HFDC/Rc ≈ 1) (Figure 1d). Furthermore, these measurements allow calculation
of the original vesicle radius before adhesion (R0), assuming surface area conservation (Figure 1e). We repeated these measurements
for 100 nm extruded vesicles and sonicated vesicles, showing that
the obtained size distributions correspond well with size distributions
acquired with dynamic light scattering (DLS).

vesicles imaged at ∼100 pN. Dashed lines correspond to the
line profiles in b with the same colors. (b) Line profiles through

that vesicles form spherical caps. (c) Height, fwhm, and radius of
curvature determined from images of 100 nm extruded vesicles imaged

but are mostly smaller than the marker. For each imaging force >180
particles were analyzed. Linear fits with slope −0.020 (−0.003
to −0.036) (height), −0.056 (−0.069 to −0.045)
(fwhm), and −0.053 (−0.063 to −0.042) (Rc) show that apparent fwhm and Rc decrease faster than the height with increasing imaging
force (ranges mark 68% confidence intervals). (d) Shape of 200 nm
extruded vesicles as characterized by height/Rc (N = 46). Inset shows example shapes corresponding
to various ratios. (e) Spherical radius of the vesicles determined
by AFM (histogram and Gaussian fits). R0 = 87 ± 14 nm (standard deviation (st.d.), N = 46), R0 = 59 ± 16 nm (st.d., N = 87), and R0 = 31 ±
11 nm (st.d., N = 21) for extruded 200 nm, extruded
100 nm and sonicated vesicles, respectively. Square markers and error
bars correspond to vesicle radii obtained with DLS: R0 = 94 ± 20 nm (st.d.), R0 = 75 ± 25 nm (st.d.), and R0 =
39 ± 4 nm (st.d.).

Nanoindentations Reveal Strong Tip Size Dependent Behavior
Next, starting with 200 nm extruded vesicles, we performed nanoindentations
by moving the AFM tip to the center of a vesicle and indenting it
multiple times using a preset force, creating force distance curves
(FDCs).24 A typical FDC is shown in Figure 2a. Before such an
indentation we always checked that we were working with a clean tip
(Figure S2). As previously observed,18,19 vesicles can withstand large deformations without permanent damage.
This robustness is inferred from the lack of change in contact point
after multiple indentations (Figure 2a) and confirmed by imaging afterward (Figure S3). Typically, we first performed a small
indentation until 500 pN. The overlap between indentation and retraction
suggests that the initial behavior is fully elastic (Figure 2a). In subsequent indentations,
we deformed the vesicle until a sudden increase in stiffness (at ∼65
nm indentation in Figure 2a), after which we observed two discontinuities, likely corresponding
to the two lipid bilayers being pushed together and penetrated (Figure 2a). The occurrence
of only two bilayer penetrations suggests that the vesicles are unilamellar
(see Figure S4).

subsequent indentations. Upper right panel shows the FDC made with

condition. Error bars represent 68% confidence intervals of the estimated
mean determined by bootstrapping (1000 repetitions). (d) Same data
as c, but plotted on logarithmic scale. Force curves show an initial
linear regime and subsequent onset of superlinear behavior. Inset
shows individual FDCs made with the 43 nm tip.

Previously, both linear and strong superlinear force–distance
relationships were reported in vesicle indentation studies.18−20,22 We reasoned that the origin of
this difference could be caused by differences in AFM tip size. To
test this hypothesis, we used an approach based on AFM tip wear on
high roughness surfaces.25 Such wear leads
to increased tip size, while the tip maintains its spherical apex,
identical tip material and cantilever properties (Figure 2b, insets and Figure S5). The tip radius (Rt) was estimated using blind tip reconstruction. Next, tips with different
radii (Rt = 18, 29, and 43 nm) were used
to indent multiple vesicles (Figure 2a,b) and create average FDCs using a single FDC per
vesicle (Figure S6). When we used the larger
tips, we noticed a strong superlinear response (Figure 2b,c). The initial part of the average FDCs
made with the various tips overlaps, but larger tips result in an
early (0.05–0.1 Rc) stiffening.
The initial response for larger tips is approximately linear and the
stiffening leads to an exponent of ∼2, which is also observed
in individual FDCs (Figure 2d). Interestingly, previous observations of linear behavior
were made with smaller tips (Rt ≈
15 nm)19 than observations of superlinear
behavior (Rt ≈ 30 nm)18,20 and with our current results we have a clear explanation for these
differences.

High Vesicle Stiffness Is Inconsistent with Bending Alone
A single FDC per vesicle from the data gathered with sharp tips
was used to measure the effective stiffness K of
vesicles in the regime of linear response (0.02–0.1 Rc), resulting in a value of 0.015 ± 0.001
N/m (s.e.m., N = 46) for 200 nm extruded vesicles
(Figure S7). Measurements with extruded
100 nm vesicles (K = 0.021 ± 0.001 N/m (s.e.m., N = 84)) and sonicated vesicles (K = 0.032
± 0.002 N/m (s.e.m., N = 42)) had similar stiffness.
To gain insight in the factors contributing to the vesicle stiffness,
we proceeded to describe the mechanical behavior in terms of intrinsic
membrane properties, i.e., a bending modulus κ and stretch modulus
σ.16,17,26,27 Since the applied force is perpendicular to the bilayer
plane, the contribution of stretching is expected to be negligible.
In case of bending energy alone, the vesicle effective stiffness,
with units of energy per length squared, should be of order κ/R2, where κ is the membrane bending modulus
(typically 10–50 kbT for a fluid bilayer).28,29 For vesicles much larger
than the membrane thickness, the relevant length scale R should be the vesicle radius of curvature Rc. For the typical radii in our experiments (Rc ∼ 100 nm), the stiffness is expected to be of
order ∼10–5 N/m. This strongly suggests that
bilayer bending alone cannot account for the 3-orders of magnitude
higher stiffness observed experimentally. Therefore, the obtained
stiffness is likely dominated by an osmotic pressure difference over
the membrane (ΔΠ). Vesicles adhered to the surface are
deformed and the lipid bilayer is only able to stretch a few percent.30 Hence, the internal volume of vesicles shrinks
and the concentration of membrane impermeable solutes in the lumen
goes up, causing an osmotic pressure difference over the membrane.
This osmotic pressure in turn will make the vesicle resist indentation
and thus increase the stiffness.

Development of an Indentation Model for Fluid Lipid Bilayers
With clean data in place and knowing the potential role of pressure,
we set out to generate a quantitative model. Prior nanoindentation
experiments of vesicles have been interpreted using the thin elastic
shell model.18,19 Elastic shell theory, however,
does not account for membrane fluidity, as it assumes a finite in-plane
shear modulus. Therefore, we introduce a model based on the Canham–Helfrich
theory for fluid bilayer membranes.27,31,32 This theory has been widely used for description
and characterization of membranes in a variety of experimental studies,
mostly at the micrometer scale.16,17 In our model, we use
symmetric bilayers with a bending modulus κ. We model a nanoindentation
experiment as compression between two tips, which we do for two reasons.
On the one hand, one may expect that deformation occurs mostly near
the tip, in which case the deformation of one hemisphere in the symmetric
case can be used to approximate the deformation of a hemispherical
adherent vesicle. On the other hand, any attempt to model the adhesion
more directly, would require knowledge of the adhesion strength, which
we lack.

Following Seifert et al.,32 we characterize the (assumed axisymmetric) vesicle by a coordinate S, where 0 ≤ S ≤ S1, and angle ψ (S), as
well as Cartesian coordinates 1  and a similar expression for z (S) with cos ψ replaced by sin ψ. The
origin is chosen to be the “South Pole” (Figure 3a). We impose the following
conditions for a closed membrane: ψ (0) = 0, ψ (S1) = π, and x(0) = x(S1) = 0. In these terms, the
free energy associated with bending is 2  where c0 is the
spontaneous curvature. We use zero spontaneous curvature and note
that our results are insensitive to a spontaneous curvature on the
order of the vesicle radius (Figure S8).
Since the applied force is perpendicular to the bilayer plane, the
contribution of stretching is expected to be negligible, and we assume
the membrane to be laterally incompressible. We impose this constraint
by the condition of constant area: 3

theory. (a) Parametrization of the model. An undeformed (solid black
sphere) and deformed shape (dashed line) are shown. Z is the axis
of symmetry. S is the length of the arc, which is

(ΔΠRc3κ–1) 1800, for a parabolic tip with Rt = 0.1 Rc (solid line). In
regime I (blue background), the apex of the vesicle flattens and the
force response curve is slightly superlinear. In regime II (green)
the response softens and a tether is formed. In regime III the response
stiffens due to increased contact area between vesicle and tip. Dashed
and dotted line show indentation curves with Rt = 0.25 Rc respectively Rt = 0.5 Rc. At the
top shapes belonging to the 3 different regimes (indentations 0.2,
0.55, and 0.87 Rc from left to right)
are visualized (arrows indicate axes in x,y, and z-direction). Lower
right inset shows same curves on logarithmic scale (units same as

a typical force distance curve illustrating the experimental determination
of the inflection point for a 200 nm vesicle. FDC with ∼1000
points (in gray); smoothed FDC (in black); numerical derivative of
FDC (blue line). Peak of derivative corresponds to the inflection
point. Lower panel shows histogram with the localization of inflection
point for 200 nm vesicles. Twenty-six out of 34 FDCs (∼76%)
that do not show discontinuities before 0.3 Rc were used. Red arrow indicates predicted theoretical value.

Since this constraint reduces to a choice of S1 for a given geometric shape defined by ψ, we choose
to simply define ψ to be a function of σ = S/S1 ∈ [0,1] (Supporting Information). Using this approach, e.g., for symmetric
vesicle shapes, we define ψ (σ) as a sum over various
shape modes: 4  

We choose to use only the first six shape modes (n = 6) (Supporting Information, Figure S9).

To model an applied indentation force acting at the “North
Pole”, we add an additional term to the energy F of the form fz(S1). This approach corresponds to symmetric, point-like
tips indenting the vesicles from both poles if only even shape modes an are allowed to be nonzero. We implemented
symmetric parabolic tips of curvature Rt by the addition of a potential 5  to the energy, again, provided that only even
modes an are allowed. There, the strength U0 of the potential is simply chosen to be large
enough to enforce that z > – Rtx2/2, which can only affect
the lower hemisphere. However, due to the use of only even modes an, this condition is also imposed on the upper
hemisphere.

Finally, a pressure difference is included. It is necessary to
account for two distinct contributions, the luminal osmotic pressure
Πint and the external osmotic pressures Πext, where the former increases with decreasing volume 6  during indentation, while the latter is constant.
Given a net pressure difference ΔΠ = Πint – Πext, the change in free energy is given
by dF = −ΔΠdV. We assume a dilute solution (ideal gas) form for the
internal pressure 7  where (0) refers to prior to indentation.

To solve for the vesicle shape, we minimize the full energy, including
bending, pressure, and tip shape, for a given force f, subject to the various constraints, including the area constraint.
This yields the various shape amplitudes an, as well as the length S1. From these,
we obtain the height z(S1) and indentation, as functions of the applied force f. Solving the shape for various forces then allowed construction
of theoretical FDCs (Figure 3b). By working in reduced coordinates x̂ and ẑ, it becomes natural to express energies
in units of 2πκ, lengths in units of πRc, forces in units of 2κRc–1, stiffness
in units of 2κRc–2, and pressure in units of πκRc–3. In this model of a symmetric vesicle, the mechanical response depends
only on a single unknown, the bending modulus, along with ΔΠ
and the AFM tip radius, which can both be determined separately.

Experimental Observations Agree Well with the Model for Fluid
Lipid Bilayers
The indentation response (Figure 3b) based on our model exhibits
three regimes: (I) an approximately linear (exponent α ≈
1.05) increase of force with indentation that corresponds to the flattening
of the apex of the vesicle. The stiffness K for small
indentations (<0.1 Rc) is ∼28κRc–2 (typically ∼10–4 N/m) for an unpressurized vesicle, indeed much lower
than the experimentally observed stiffness in this regime (typically
∼10–2 N/m) (Figure S8). (II) A flattening of the FDC that is consistent with the onset
of formation of an inward membrane tether at 0.35–0.40 Rc. The onset of this appears
to be only weakly dependent on ΔΠ (Figure S8). For a point force or very sharp tip, tether formation
would result in a force plateau. Extended inward tether formation
has been recently observed with GUVs.33 Moreover, this is in agreement with recent MD-simulations showing
flattening of the FDC at similar indentations.9 (III) Finally, the finite size of the AFM tip prevents tether extension
and leads to a tip dominated stiffening (α ≈ 2) (Figure 3b). Corresponding
shapes to the three regimes are shown as insets in Figure 3b. A larger tip results in
an earlier onset of the stiffening (Figure 3b) and an extended deformation zone of the
vesicle (Figure S10). However, at low pressures
no tether forms and, instead, deformation occurs on longer length
scales, which results in the tip size dependence becoming apparent
only at deeper indentations (Figure S8).
Hence, the experimental observation of tip dependence for small indentations
(Figure 2d) suggests
that the vesicles are strongly pressurized. Furthermore, softening
of experimental FDCs occurs at similar indentation as in the model
at 0.31 ± 0.03 Rc (s.e.m., N = 26) (Figure 3c). Together, this shows that the model accurately describes
the experimental results and that vesicles in our experiments are
likely strongly pressurized.

Bending Modulus and Pressure Estimation
Finally, to
understand the mechanical response of our vesicles, we need to take
pressurization into account. Osmotic pressurization occurs when a
vesicle is deformed on the surface in our experiments. However, it
is probably a biologically relevant effect, since other interactions,
such as adherence of vesicles to a cell surface, likely result in
similar pressurization. Experimentally, we estimate the pressure from
outward membrane tethers formed during retraction of the AFM tip (Figure 4a, Figure S11). It is well-known that the tether force corresponds
to , where σ is the tension in the membrane.34,35 The tension is likely mostly due to the pressure difference over
the membrane and hence we can use the Young–LaPlace equation
(ΔΠ = 2σRc-1) to obtain a direct relationship
between tether force and osmotic pressure over the membrane, with
the bending modulus as the only unknown:ΔΠ = Ft2(4π2Rcκ)−1. Normalized pressure ΔΠRc3κ–1 can then be expressed as (RcFt)2 (2πκ)−2. Hence, we can now plot our experimental data using normalized units
with κ as the only unknown.

Figure 4 Bending modulus and pressure estimation. (a) Tether force measurements.
Left panel shows a typical tether formed during a FDC (approach in
gray, retrace in black). Blue lines indicate two fitted regimes; the
difference is the tether force. Right panel shows histogram of tether
forces measured in the retrace of 200 nm extruded vesicles (N = 46). (b) Dimensionless pressure versus dimensionless
stiffness. In red the theoretically predicted curve. Markers show
experimental data for 3 preparations of vesicles (200 nm, N = 42, 100 nm, N = 76; sonicated, N = 36). Bending modulus was used as single fitting parameter.
(c) Pressure ΔΠ = Ft2(4π2Rcκ)−1 estimated for the 3 combined
samples. Median lies at 0.15 ± 0.02 MPa (68% confidence interval
obtained by bootstrap).

Next, we obtained theoretical FDCs for various pressures (in units
of κRc–3) and determined their stiffness (in
units of κRc–2) numerically (Table S1). Interpolation then allowed us to derive a general
relationship, which is independent of κ, between the normalized
pressure ΔΠRc3κ–1 and normalized
stiffness KRc2κ–1 of a vesicle (Figure 4b). Two regimes are
visible in the resulting curve: the response is bending dominated
when ΔΠ < ∼ 10 κRc–3 and pressure
dominated for larger values of ΔΠ. The experimental data
of the sonicated, and 100 and 200 nm extruded vesicles, when plotted
in these units, collapse for any value of κ, demonstrating the
general nature of the model (Figure S12). Moreover, fitting the experimental data to the theoretical curve
yields a bending modulus of κ = 14 ± 1kbT (s.e.m. obtained by bootstrap) (Figure 4b). This is a typical
value of kappa for fluid lipid bilayers.28,29 Finally, having this estimate for κ allows the evaluation
of the pressure difference ΔΠ, which is remarkably high
at ∼0.15 MPa (Figure 4c, Figure S11).

Discussion
Most recent nanoindentation studies of SUVs using AFM have been
interpreted using shell elasticity models.18−20 Such models,
however, are for shells with finite shear moduli. It is well-known,
e.g., from studies with GUVs,16,17 that biological membranes
have finite bending and stretching moduli but they usually have a
vanishing shear modulus.27,31 Importantly, for a
spherical geometry, indentation is not possible without in-plane shear,
which would increase shell elastic energy. Thus, previously used shell
elasticity models with finite shear modulus are likely not suitable
for fluid vesicles such as those studied here. Indeed, multiple aspects
of the mechanical behavior observed in our experiments cannot be captured
by predictions from such shell elasticity models. For example, we
observed strong tip size dependence of the mechanical response, which
is not expected in shell theory.36 Also,
onset of flattening of the FDC using the appropriate dimensions for
a SUV in these theories is predicted to occur much earlier (∼0.05 Rc)19 than observed
in our experiments (∼0.3 Rc). The
theory presented here, which takes the fluidity of the lipid bilayer
into account, does describe these aspects accurately.

We used our model to understand the mechanical behavior and estimate
the bending modulus of 30–200 nm vesicles with membranes of
complex lipid mixture. The predicted mechanical behavior and bending
modulus estimates remain to be validated for different membrane compositions.
However, it is expected that our approach and model will be broadly
applicable for other artificial and natural vesicles in the same size
range, as long as the membrane is fluid. Moreover, the mechanical
behavior identified here, such as the inflection at 0.35–0.40 Rc and the strong tip size dependence, could
potentially be useful to test the fluidity of the membrane of nanovesicles,
since their occurrence is not expected for membranes with finite shear
moduli.19,36

In this study, we also showed that variation in tip size can have
a dramatic effect on observed mechanical behavior probed by nanoindentation.
To establish the role of tip size we applied a recently introduced
method for broadening tip size without compromising the spherical
apex of the tip.25 Additionally, this method
does not affect tip chemical properties or cantilever properties.
The difference in mechanical response we observed here can be explained
by the physical obstruction of lipid tether elongation by the tip
leading to a stiffening of the response, which occurs earlier for
broader tips. This difference might also explain the large variation
in previously reported results of SUV mechanics.18−22 Hence, the approach taken in this study might both
help in understanding the mechanical behavior and generating more
reproducible AFM results for all kinds of nanoparticles.

AFM has recently gained popularity for performing size measurements
on both natural and artificial vesicles.37−39 Here, we made
several steps in image data analysis that could help in making such
size measurements more accurate. First, we used a tip correction for
spherical cap shaped vesicles. Tip radius is rarely negligible compared
to the radius of SUVs and hence correcting for tip size is essential.
A benefit of this correction is that no upfront assumption of degree
of vesicle spreading is required. Second, to calculate the original
spherical radius of the vesicle from the deformed shape on the surface
one typically assumes that the vesicle volume is conserved.40 In our study we used the assumption that the
surface area is conserved, since the contents of the vesicle might
leak, but the membrane is barely able to stretch.30 Indeed, we show that vesicles have likely leaked part of
their contents (Figure S11). Finally, we
show that small normal imaging forces (∼100 pN) can already
strongly deform SUVs, even in absence of lateral forces. These forces
affect the obtained height, but affect the fwhm or radius measurements
to an even higher extent. Exerting high imaging forces will therefore
lead to underestimation of the vesicle size. We used a correction
based on combination of imaging and indentation. This approach makes
size measurements more time intensive, but these results show that
for vesicle size measurements normal forces should at least be minimized.
These analysis steps can be broadly applied for accurate measurements
of vesicle size and shape.

Finally, our results show that liposomes are strongly stiffened
by increased internal osmotic pressure due to deformation by surface
adhesion. This finding is important for experimental measurements
of vesicle mechanical properties because ignoring the effect of pressure
on vesicle stiffness might lead to overestimation of the bending modulus
of vesicles. This phenomenon is probably also important for vesicle
behavior, such as vesicle uptake by cells. During cellular uptake
similar vesicle deformations to those in our experiments are likely
to occur, in that case due to adhesion to the cell.12,41 Strong vesicle deformation is believed to impede full uptake.12,13 However, pressurization due to deformation would stiffen the vesicle
during spreading, which in turn would restrain further deformation
and could hence facilitate cellular uptake. Recently, it was suggested
that stiffness of nanoparticles can potentially be leveraged to establish
specific drug delivery functions, such as cellular uptake.11,12 For this purpose, it is critical to understand which factors determine
the particle stiffness. Therefore, our observation that pressure can
strongly affect the mechanical response of SUVs is of immediate interest
for the rational design of vesicles for drug delivery.

Conclusions
To summarize, we have presented a thorough AFM nanoindentation
based approach for quantification of the mechanics of fluid nanovesicles.
In parallel we developed a theoretical model for vesicle indentation,
which takes into account the fluidity of the membrane. The experimental
data and model agree well and are consistent with a bending modulus
of 14 kbT. Moreover,
we have shown the importance of pressure for the mechanics of deformed
vesicles under physiological conditions. Our approach will help in
the fundamental understanding of the mechanical response of fluid
nanovesicles as well as extracting more reliable parameters from experimental
data. Therefore, this is an important advance for future nanomechanical
studies of natural vesicles, as well as engineered nanocarriers used
for drug delivery.

Methods
Liposome Preparation
EggPC (P2772) and cholesterol
(C8667) were ordered from Sigma. Brain PS (840032C) was ordered from
Avanti Polar lipids. Egg PE and Egg SM were ordered from Lipoid. To
make unilamellar liposomes, a protocol was adapted from Li et al.18 In short: lipid powder was dissolved at 20 mg/mL
in a 9:1 chloroform to methanol solution in a round-bottom flask.
Molar ratio of mixed lipids was 15% Egg PC, 17% Egg PE, 8% Brain PS,
15% Egg SM, and 45% cholesterol. This complex lipid mixture is designed
to mimic the lipid concentrations in the red blood cell42 and similarly vesicles excreted by red blood
cells.43 For Figure 1c a slightly different composition was used
with 4% Brain PS and otherwise similar ratios. The solvent was dried
in a rotary evaporator (Buchi), first for 30 min at 400 mbar, and
subsequently at least another 30 min at 100 mbar. Dried lipids were
resuspended in PBS at 0.075 mg/mL final concentration. After vortexing
and sonicating (1 min each), liposomes were frozen at −80 °C
and thawed at 37 °C during 5 cycles. Finally, liposomes were
extruded 30 times back and forth through two layers of 100 or 200
nm filters. In the case of sonicated vesicles, liposomes were sonicated
for 15 min instead.

AFM Experiments
Vesicles were adhered to poly-l-lysine coated glass slides in PBS. Slides were first cleaned in
a 96% ethanol, 3% HCl solution for 10 min. Afterward they were coated
for 1 h in a 0.001% poly-l-lysine (Sigma) solution and dried
overnight at 37 °C. They were stored at 7 °C for maximum
1 month. A 50 μL drop of vesicle solution was incubated on the
glass slide. Vesicles were imaged in PeakForce Tapping mode on a Bruker
Bioscope catalyst setup. All AFM measurements were performed in fluid
(PBS). Force set point during imaging was 100 pN, unless stated otherwise.
Nanoindentations were performed by first recording an image of a single
particle, then indenting with forces of subsequently 0.5 nN, 2 nN,
and 5 nN at 250 nms–1 and typically making a final
image after indentation to check for movement of the vesicle. Importantly,
both before and after the vesicle indentation, the tip was checked
for adherent lipid bilayers by pushing on the glass surface until
a force of 5 nN (Figure S2), or 10 nN in
the case of blunt tips. Silicon nitride tips with a nominal tip radius
of 15 nm on a 0.1 N/m cantilever were used (Olympus; OMCL-RC800PSA).
Individual cantilevers were calibrated using thermal tuning.

AFM Image Analysis
Both images and force curves were
processed using home-built MATLAB software. Size and shape were analyzed
from line profiles through the maximum of the vesicle along the slow
scanning axis. Circular arcs were fit to the part of the vesicle above
half of the maximum height to obtain the radius of curvature. For
calculation of R0 a minimum radius of
the contact curvature of 5 nm was assumed, since a sharper contact
angle is nonphysical.23 For the data in Figure 1c vesicles with a
minimum height and width of respectively 20 and 40 nm were used.

AFM FDC Analysis
Cantilever response was measured on
the sample surface and fitted linearly. The resulting fit was subtracted
from the measured response when indenting vesicles to obtain FDCs.
Contact point was determined by using a change point algorithm,44 and occasionally manually adjusted. Before fitting,
FDCs were smoothed (moving average with window length of ∼10
points). All parameters (stiffness, inflection point, tether force)
were determined using a single FDC per vesicle. This was typically
the second FDC on each vesicle, since the first was made until a low
force and did always go to deep enough indentations to determine,
e.g., the inflection point. Overlap between first and second indentations
was very high (Figure 2a,b). Stiffness of the liposomes was found by fitting a straight
line in the interval between 0.02–0.1 Rc. This interval was chosen to have one consistent measure,
in which the vesicles (including sonicated vesicles) showed no onset
of superlinear behavior and no discontinuities. To find the inflection
point, FDCs were smoothed further (moving average with window length
of ∼40 points and Savitzky–Golay-filter with window
length ∼20 point). Then, the derivative was taken numerically
and the location of the maximum was obtained. For finding the tether
force a home-built step-fitting algorithm based on the change point
algorithm was used, which divides the curve into segments with slope
0. Only adhesion events extending beyond the contact point were included.
For the fit in Figure 4b, an interpolating function through 13 calculated theoretical value
pairs (Table S1) was created in Mathematica.
The sum of the squared log Euclidian distance between the resulting
curve and experimental values , where xj and yj are theoretical
values pairs for normalized pressure and normalized stiffness, was
then minimized by adjusting κ as single parameter. Error bars
were estimated by 500 bootstrapping repetitions, for which 154 experimental
value combinations were randomly drawn and fitted.

Blind Tip Estimation
Measurements were performed in
contact mode on UNCD Aqua 100 surfaces (Advanced Diamond Technologies,
Inc.). Blind tip estimation was performed with software from the AFM
manufacturer (NanoScope Analaysis). Images were flattened and low
pass filtered. Tip estimation was performed using spike rejection
(sigma mult 7) and discontinuity rejection (sigma mult 3), which exclude
points and lines, respectively, based on a maximum difference in height
compared to directly neighboring pixels. End radius (Rt) was estimated by fitting a spherical cap to the resultant
tip image from 15 nm below the apex.

Dynamic Light Scattering
DLS measurements were recorded
using the Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments Ltd.). Size measurements
are based on intensity.
