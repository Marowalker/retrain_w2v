Scalable
production of all-electronic DNA biosensors with high
sensitivity and selectivity is a critical enabling step for research
and applications associated with detection of DNA hybridization. We
have developed a scalable and very reproducible (>90% yield) fabrication
process for label-free DNA biosensors based upon graphene field effect
transistors (GFETs) functionalized with single-stranded probe DNA.
The shift of the GFET sensor Dirac point voltage varied systematically
with the concentration of target DNA. The biosensors demonstrated
a broad analytical range and limit of detection of 1 fM for 60-mer
DNA oligonucleotide. In control experiments with mismatched DNA oligomers,
the impact of the mismatch position on the DNA hybridization strength
was confirmed. This class of highly sensitive DNA biosensors offers
the prospect of detection of DNA hybridization and sequencing in a
rapid, inexpensive, and accurate way.

==== Body
All-electronic DNA biosensors
offer considerable promise for rapid genetic screening and nucleic
acid detection for gene-expression investigations, pharmacogenomics,
drug discovery, and molecular diagnostics.1 In order to enable these applications, the electronic DNA biosensors
need to be sensitive, selective, and based upon a scalable fabrication
process. Wafer-scale graphene, a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon with
remarkable electronic sensitivity, outstanding biocompatibility,2 and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio,3 can be prepared via chemical
vapor deposition.4,5 However, very few previous reports
on graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) for DNA sensing6−10 were based on scalable fabrication methods. To this point there
are no reports of more than 10 functional devices fabricated on a
single chip, and the sensitivity has been limited to 100 fM.7

Here we describe the development of scalable
DNA biosensors based
on back-gated GFETs functionalized with probe DNA (Figure 1a), yielding sensitivity as
low as 1 fM (∼6 × 105 DNA molecules in a 1
mL drop). We prepared graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
and fabricated GFETs with conventional photolithography. The GFETs
demonstrated high yield (>90%) and consistent transport properties.
The GFETs were functionalized using a well-controlled chemical treatment
that enabled high surface coverage with single-stranded probe DNA.
DNA biosensors created in this way exhibit a wide analytical range
(three decades in concentration) and excellent selectivity against
noncomplementary DNA oligomers. The sensitivity of the DNA biosensors
depends systematically on the length of the oligomer, and for 60-mer
DNA a 1 fM limit of detection was achieved. The response calibration
curves of the DNA biosensors were in excellent agreement with predictions
of the Sips model11 for DNA hybridization.
Our control experiments confirmed that sensor responses were determined
by hybridization between the probe and target DNA oligomers, and the
results were consistent with earlier reports of hybridization using
DNA microarrays. Our methodology has the potential to be developed
into a rapid and convenient point-of-care tool with clinically relevant
sensitivity.

A 2.5 × 2.5 cm graphene sample
was prepared via chemical vapor deposition on a copper
growth substrate and transferred
using an electrolysis bubbling method12 onto a 2 × 2.5 cm oxidized silicon substrate with prefabricated,
45 nm thick Cr/Au electrodes for an array of 52 GFETs. We find that
this transfer method effectively limits contamination, doping, and
damage associated with graphene transfer. The GFET channels were then
defined using photolithography and oxygen plasma etching (Figure 1b, inset). The sensor
array was cleaned by annealing in an argon/hydrogen atmosphere before
further characterization or chemical functionalization. (See Methods for additional details of the fabrication
process.) This method is compatible with scale up to thousands of
GFETs or more, as well as integration with prefabricated CMOS signal
processing circuitry.13

The graphene
in the GFET channels was single layer with low defect
density, as verified by the 2D/G ratio (∼2) and the minimal
D peak intensity in the Raman spectrum14 (Figure 1b). The
excellent quality of the graphene enables consistent GFET transport
properties and high fabrication yield (>90%), based on more than
30
arrays fabricated for this experiment. As shown in Figure 1c, the current–gate
voltage (I–Vg) characteristics
for all 52 GFETs in a single array are very similar. The Dirac point
of the GFETs, where the I–Vg characteristic
has a minimum, lies in a narrow range near zero back-gate voltage,
3.6 ± 4.0 V (Figure 1d), indicating low doping effects induced in our methodology.

After annealing, the GFET channels were functionalized by incubation
for 20 h in a solution of the bifunctional linker molecule 1-pyrenebutyric
acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE) in dimethylformamide
(DMF) (see Methods for details). The aromatic
pyrenyl group of PBASE binds to the basal plane of graphene through
the noncovalent π–π interaction.15,16 This process yields a uniform, ∼1 nm thick monolayer17 of self-assembled PBASE on the graphene (see
linescan (1) in Figure 2a), except at wrinkles (∼nm high) in the CVD graphene created
by the transfer process.18 The aminated
(5′) probe DNA (22-mer, 40-mer, or 60-mer) was then bound to
the PBASE linker by an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
cross-linking reaction (see Methods for details).
Due to the high coverage of the PBASE monolayer, the probe DNA molecules
were immobilized on the graphene channel at such high density that
individual DNA molecules could not be distinguished in the AFM images
(Figure 2a) acquired
using an Asylum MFP-3D AFM and an NCST AFM cantilever (Nano World).
The average height increase of the GFET due to attachment of the 22-mer
probe DNA is ∼1.2 nm, consistent with the molecular size. After
attachment of the probe DNA, GFET DNA biosensors were tested against
the complementary single-strand DNA “target” and various
controls.

Results and Discussion
The I–Vg characteristics
of the GFET devices were measured in the dry state5 after each step of functionalization chemistry and again
after exposure to the target. The value of the Dirac voltage for each I–Vg characteristic is
determined using a curve-fitting method19 through the equation  Here I is the current, μ
is the mobility, Vbg is the back-gate
voltage, VD is the Dirac voltage, α
= 7.2 × 1016 cm–2 V–2 is the constant relating gate voltage to carrier number density,
and Is is the saturation current due to
short-range scattering.20 Formation of
the PBASE monolayer leads to an increase in VD of ∼23 ± 3.3 V (Figure 2b). This is explained by considering chemical
gating effects associated with residual water on the device surface.
Here, we assume that NHS groups are hydrolyzed into carboxyl groups,
which deprotonate and acquire a negative charge. Attachment of 22-mer
probe DNA led to a further 40 V increase in the Dirac voltage, which
is explained quantitatively through the chemical-gating effect21 of probe-DNA molecules that become negatively
charged due to ionization of phosphate groups in residual water. This
Dirac voltage shift corresponds to an increase in the positive (hole)
carrier density in the graphene by ∼3.0 × 1012 cm–2. Assuming chemical gating of 22 negative
charges for each oligomer, the density of immobilized probe DNA is
∼1.3 × 103 μm–2, more
than an order of magnitude higher than the level of protein attachment
achieved using a very similar functionalization approach.5,21 This corresponds to a separation of ∼25 nm between DNA molecules,
consistent with the uniform DNA coverage observed by AFM (Figure 2a).

In response
experiments, all 52 GFET sensors on a single chip were
tested against a solution with a known concentration of target DNA
or a related control in deionized water. The Dirac voltage of the I–Vg characteristic showed
a reproducible shift to positive voltage, ΔVD, as seen in Figure 2c. To compare results across the three different DNA
targets, for each concentration tested we plot the Dirac voltage shift
relative to ΔVD0, the shift measured upon exposure to pure
deionized water, i.e., ΔVDREL = ΔVD – ΔVD0, with the results shown in Figure 3a. For all DNA oligomers
tested, the relative shift varied systematically with target concentration,
and it is ascribed to an increase in the positive carrier concentration
in the GFET channel induced by the negatively charged phosphate groups
of target DNA molecules that have hybridized with probe DNA on the
GFET surface.

for DNA targets of different lengths. Error bars (standard deviation
of the mean) are approximately equal to the size of the plotted point.
Solid curves are fits to the data based on the Sips model. (b) Variation
of the fit parameters A (red data) and KA (blue data) in eq 1 with DNA oligomer length. The red and blue lines are fits
to the data, as discussed in the main text.

The Sips model11,22 for describing DNA
hybridization
provides an excellent fit to the measured data for ΔVDREL as a function of target concentration: 1  where c is the concentration
of the target DNA solution, A the maximum response
with all binding sites occupied, and KA the equilibrium dissociation constant. The parameter a in the Sips model represents a Gaussian distribution of DNA-binding
energies, where a = 1 corresponds to single binding
energy level. The best fit to the data for the 22-mer target yields
fit parameter values A = 5.9 ± 0.4 V, KA = 2.9 ± 0.9 nM, and a = 0.56 ± 0.07. The analytic range of the fit (Figure 3a) covers 3 orders of magnitude,
from ∼100 pM to ∼100 nM, with a sensitivity of ∼1.4
V/decade. The data set presented in Figure 3a indicates that GFET-based DNA biosensors
can differentiate between DI water and a solution containing the 22-mer
target at a concentration of <100 pM. Although this is higher than
an earlier report7 with a detection limit
of 100 fM for 20-mer DNA, our approach offers the advantages of scalable
fabrication and device miniaturization (52 devices per array). The
best fit value of KA, 2.4 ± 0.8 nM,
agrees well with that expected for 20-mer DNA hybridization,23 1.7 nM. The best fit value of a = 0.56 ± 0.07 implies a heterogeneous adsorption isotherm with
a distribution of binding energies11,22 rather than
a single-value DNA–DNA binding energy, which would yield a = 1. This binding energy distribution is assumed to reflect
significant interactions between the probe and/or target DNA and the
graphene surface.24

We also tested
GFET DNA biosensors based on 40-mer probe DNA and
60-mer probe DNA. As shown in Figure 3a, the limit of detection (LOD) using 40-mer probe
DNA is ∼100 fM, and the 60-mer target DNA was reliably detected
at a concentration of 1 fM. The Sips model fit parameters for the
three probe DNA sequences are shown in Table 1. The distribution function index is roughly
the same for the different DNA targets, indicating a comparable degree
of binding energy heterogeneity. The fit values for A and KA demonstrate two advantages of
using longer DNA oligomers. First, the maximum signal level (A) increases nearly linearly with DNA length, at a rate
of 0.27 V/mer (see Figure 3b, red data points). This is assumed to reflect that the charge
carried by each DNA chain increases as the DNA length increases, enhancing
the chemical gating effect on the graphene and leading to a proportionately
larger Dirac voltage shift. Second, the dissociation constant decreases
exponentially for longer DNA. As seen in Figure 3b, the log(KA)–length relationship is approximately linear, with a slope
of −0.225 ± 0.024. This is in good agreement with the
slope of −0.138 ± 0.006 that was found using a quartz
crystal microbalance approach.23

Multiple control experiments were conducted with 22-mer DNA biosensors
to verify that the biosensor responses reflected specific binding
of the complementary target DNA. A variety of control samples were
used, with all control solutions having a concentration of 1 μM
in DI water. In Figure 4, we report the results as the Dirac voltage shift induced by the
target or control at a concentration of 1 μM, relative to the
shift induced by pure DI water. The target 22-mer DNA gives the largest
value for the relative Dirac voltage shift (ΔVDREL = 5.7
± 0.4 V), which is expected since it should have the highest
binding affinity for the probe DNA and therefore the largest associated
change in GFET carrier concentration. The single base-mismatch controls
are expected to interact more weakly with the probe DNA. It is intriguing
to note that the control with a single base mismatch at the 5′
end shows a slight response decrease (ca. +4.6 ±
0.7 V or 80 ± 12% of that for the target DNA), while the response
to control DNA with the mismatch at the center is strongly suppressed
(+0.7 ± 0.5 V), only ∼10% of that for the target DNA.
Experiments based on DNA oligonucleotide microarrays25,26 show similar effects in how the response and binding affinity depend
on the position of a single base mismatch. The reason that a mismatch
at the center of the strand has such a strong effect on hybridization
can be understood through a positional-dependent-nearest-neighbor
model.26,27 The control oligomer with two mismatches,
one at the center and one at the 5′ end, gave a sensor response
that was indistinguishable from the response to DI water, and the
same was true for the response to a 1 μM solution of a random
sequence DNA oligomer (32%, consistent with the target DNA).

Figure 4 Relative response
of GFET-based 22-mer DNA biosensors to the target
sequence and various controls, all at a concentration of 1 μM.
The base sequences of the oligomers tested are listed, with mismatches
shown in red. Starting from the bottom, the oligomers tested are target
DNA, single mismatch at the 5′ end, single mismatch at the
center, two mismatches at the 5′ end and the center, and random
sequence DNA. Error bars are standard deviation of the mean.

Conclusions
We have developed a
scalable fabrication approach for arrays of
graphene-based DNA biosensors with all-electronic readout, and we
measured their responses to the complementary DNA target and multiple
control oligomers. The fabrication process is based upon conventional
photolithographic processing and should be suitable for mass production.
The GFETs fabricated for the experiments were of very high quality,
as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electronic
measurements. The DNA biosensors have a wide analytical range and
a sensitivity that depends systematically on the length of the DNA.
For 60-mer DNA, we achieved a detection limit of 1 fM, where this
high sensitivity is enabled by the use of graphene as the transduction
material, functionalized with a high coverage of probe DNA with high
binding affinity for the target. Measured sensor responses over a
range of 6 orders of magnitude in concentration were well fit by the
Sips model. Control experiments verified that the sensor response
was derived from specific binding of the probe DNA to the target DNA
and also confirmed that the complementary DNA with a mismatch at the
center hybridizes much more weakly with the probe DNA than at the
5′ end.

Methods
CVD Growth
of Large-Area Graphene
Monolayer graphene
was grown via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition
on a copper foil substrate (99.8%, 25 μm thick, Alfa Aesar)
in a four-inch quartz tube furnace. The copper was annealed for 60
min at 1020 °C in ultra-high-purity hydrogen (99.999%; flow rate
80 sccm). Graphene was then synthesized using methane as a precursor
(temperature 1020 °C; hydrogen flow rate 80 sccm; methane flow
rate 10 sccm; pressure 850 mT; growth time 20 min). The tube was then
cooled to room temperature in 40 min.

Graphene Transfer
A sacrificial layer of 500 nm thick
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-coated on top of the graphene/copper
substrate. The sample was baked for 2 min at 100 °C, then connected
to the cathode of a power supply and immersed in a 50 mM sodium hydroxide
solution in deionized (DI) water. A constant voltage of 20 V was applied
between the cathode and a platinum anode also in the electrolyte solution.
Under these conditions, hydrogen bubbles were generated between graphene
and the copper foil, causing the PMMA/graphene film to detach from
the copper substrate. The PMMA/graphene film was then washed in a
series of DI water baths and transferred onto the surface of a 300
nm SiO2/Si substrate on which Cr/Au electrodes had previously
been fabricated. The sample was left to dry for 1 h, then baked at
150 °C for 2 min before the PMMA film was removed by washing
with acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The sample was then dried with
compressed nitrogen.

GFET Array Fabrication
A protective
layer of polymethylglutarimide
(PMGI, Microchem) was spin-coated on the graphene and baked on a hot
plate at 125 °C for 5 min. Next, a layer of S1813 (Microchem)
was spin-coated atop the PMGI, and the chip was baked on a hot plate
at 100 °C for 2 min. The channel regions of the GFETs were defined
using optical lithography, and the chip was developed in MF-319 (Microposit)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, cleaned with
DI water, and finally dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Graphene
outside of the defined FET channels was removed by oxygen plasma etching
for 30 s (power 80 W, O2 gas pressure 1.25 Torr). Photoresist
residue on the chip was removed by soaking in acetone (5 min), photoresist
remover 1165 (Microposit, 5 min), and acetone (30 min) followed by
a final rinse with isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The GFET array was then
annealed in tube furnace under flowing hydrogen (250 sccm) and argon
(1000 sccm) at 225 °C for 1 h.

PBASE Functionalization,
Probe-DNA Immobilization, and Testing
against Target or Control Solution
The GFET array was soaked
in a 1 mM PBASE (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMF (Fisher) solution for 20 h
and then washed thoroughly with DMF, IPA, and DI water, each for 3
min. The array was then incubated in a 1 μM aqueous solution
of 22-mer probe-DNA (5′-amine-CCCAACAACATGAAACTACCTA-3′),
40-mer probe-DNA (5′-amine-AATTACAAAAACAAATTACAAAAATTCAAAATTTTCGGGT-3′),
or 60-mer probe-DNA (5′-amine-AAACTAAAGAATTACAAAAACAAATTACAAAAATTCAAAATTTTCGGGTTTATTACAGGG-3′)
for 3 h and rinsed with DI water. Following probe attachment, an aqueous
solution of target or control DNA with known concentration was pipetted
onto the chip, and incubated in a warm, humid environment for 30 min
to suppress evaporation. The chip was rinsed with DI water and dried
with compressed nitrogen before performing electrical measurements.
