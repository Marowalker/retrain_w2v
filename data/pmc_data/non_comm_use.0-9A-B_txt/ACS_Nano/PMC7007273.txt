Understanding
the complexity of fragmentation processes is essential
for regulating intercellular communication in mechanistic biology
and developing bottom-up approaches in a large range of multiphase
flow processes. In this context, self-fragmentation proceeds without
any external mechanical energy input, allowing one to create efficiently
micro- and nanodroplets. Here we examine self-fragmentation in emulsion
nanodroplets stabilized by solid particles with different surface
features. Mesoscopic modeling and accelerated dynamics simulations
allow us to overcome the limitations of atomistic simulations and
offer detailed insight into the interplay between the evolution of
the droplet shape and the particle finite-size effects at the interface.
We show that finite-size nanoparticles play an active role in the necking breakup, behaving like nanoscale razors, and
affect strongly the thermodynamic properties of the system. The role
played by the particles during self-fragmentation might be of relevance
to multifunctional biomaterial design and tuning of signaling pathways
in mechanistic biology.

Emulsion
droplets are metastable
dispersions composed of two immiscible fluids such as water and oil.1,2 The associated surface tension forces them into a spherical shape
to minimize the free-energy. To decrease the latter and stabilize
the emulsion droplets, a surface-active agent can be added.3,4 In particular Pickering emulsions are stabilized by the incorporation
of particles.3,5 Emulsion droplets can serve as
ideal compartments for reactions catalyzed by nanoparticles (NPs)
attached at the oil–water interfaces6 and can be used as drug-delivery vehicles,7 sensors,8 and templates for the fabrication
of advanced functional materials.9−11 The characteristics
of Pickering emulsions pose a number of intriguing fundamental physical
questions, including a thorough understanding of the perennial lack
of detail about how particles arrange at the liquid/liquid interface.
Other not completely answered questions include particle effects on
interfacial tension,12 layering,13 buckling,14 and droplet
bridging.15 Interestingly, emulsion droplets
show some relevant characteristics and qualities of living systems
that could make them proxies for artificial life. They provide an
experimental framework for synthetic biology that is different from
other protocell model systems such as vesicles offering distinct advantages.17−19 For instance, the apparent similarity in surface properties between
inorganic NPs and globular proteins20 and
the fluid dynamical properties of droplets could be combined with
different chemistries to target applications and exploration of biological
scenarios not easily achievable with other supramolecular platforms,21 including the mechanical biology of enveloped
viruses such as the rapidly spreading Zika virus.22−24

In the
presence of colloidal particles, the stability of emulsions
against fragmentation under ultrasonication25−27 or shear stress28,29 has been a subject of strong interest either at the molecular or
mesoscopic level. However, despite the vast interest in particle-laden
interfaces, less is known about the self-fragmentation mechanism,
that is, fragmentation without any external mechanical energy input.
We refer to self-fragmentation as to any mechanism based on thermally
activated surface or local fluid current fluctuations. Such mechanisms
can be described as random fluctuations, which could result in a deformation
along a preferentially aligned direction. We describe below how such
a process could lead to droplet rupture. For instance, Tcholakova et al.30 studied a self-emulsification
process via cooling–heating cycles causing
a repeating breakup of droplets to higher-energy states. However,
such an approach relies on small changes in temperature affecting
the spontaneous curvature due to surfactant thermally activated modification.
We are here interested in self-fragmentation at constant temperature,
as it is observed in the proliferation of living cells.17−19,21

Due to their inherent limited
resolution, direct access to local
observables, such as the particles’ three-phase contact angle
distribution, the measure of decrease in interfacial tension with
the decrease in droplet size, as characterized by the Tolman length,31 or the presence of particles remain out of reach.
These pieces of information can be accessed by numerical simulations.
All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become a widely
employed computational technique. However, all-atom MD simulations
are computationally expensive. Moreover, most phenomena of interest
can take place on time scales that are orders of magnitude longer
than those accessible via all-atom MD. Mesoscopic
simulations, in which the structural unit is a coarse-grained representation
of a large number of molecules, and enhanced sampling techniques allow
us to overcome these limitations. Coarse-grained approaches offer
the possibility of answering fundamental questions responsible for
the collective behavior of particles anchored at an interface.32

We employ here dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) as a mesoscopic
simulation method33 along with accelerated
dynamics simulations34 to study accurately
the free-energy landscapes and the necking breakup mechanisms associated
with thermally assisted self-fragmentation of model water nanodroplets
coated with spherical NPs and immersed in an organic solvent. The
scaled temperature in the DPD framework is equivalent to 298.73 K.
The procedure and parametrization details are described in the Supporting Information (SI). The particles are
of two types: Janus (particles whose surface shows two distinct wetting
properties) and homogeneous (particles with one surface characteristic).
They are chosen so that the initial three-phase contact angles (≈90°)
result in maximum adsorption energy.35 To
study the thermodynamic properties of the self-fragmentation mechanism
and the role played by the finite-size particles, we combined several
enhanced sampling frameworks, including metadynamics (metaD),36 umbrella sampling (US),37 and adiabatic biased molecular dynamics (ABMD).38,39 To take into account the inherent fluid nature of the system, we
designed a dynamic collective variable (CV) allowing to bias unequivocally
the dynamics of the system based on dynamical labeling of the fluid
molecules composing the emulsion droplet as well as the mother and
the daughter droplets resulting from self-fragmentation (see Methods). We consider throughout this study the
same number of fluid molecules constituting the bare or armored emulsion
nanodroplets and the same NP density on the armored nanodroplets.

Results
and Discussion
In Figure 1 we show
representative snapshots obtained in the accelerated dynamics simulations
for the bare emulsion nanodroplet (panel a) and a system stabilized
with either Janus (panel b) or homogeneous (panel c) NPs. Starting
with the spherical bare droplet (configuration E1 in Figure 1a), the system fragments with the formation of a liquid bridge whose
shape approximately describes an evolving parabola (E2–E6). The curvature
of the liquid bridge increases continuously along the fragmentation
process until mother and daughter nanodroplets separate, resulting
in two distinct emulsion nanodroplets with radius of gyration RGYR(m) = 3.521 ± 0.004 nm and RGYR(d) = 2.188 ± 0.007 nm,
respectively (E7).

Figure 1 Sequence of simulation
snapshots representing the thermally assisted
self-fragmentation processes of water in oil nanodroplets in the bare
configuration (a) or armored with 24 spherical Janus (b) and homogeneous
(c) NPs. The bare and armored nanodroplets are constituted of the
same number of water beads, NW ≈
3500. The same NP surface coverage ϕ ≈ 0.9, as defined
in ref (16), is considered
on the armored nanodroplets. The NPs simulated have the same volume,
4/3πa03, where a0 ≈
1.5 nm. This yields the radius of gyration, RGYR = 3.764 ± 0.004 nm, and RGYR = 3.953 ± 0.008 nm for bare and armored nanodroplets, respectively.
Cyan and purple spheres represent polar and apolar beads. Pink spheres
represent water beads. The oil beads surrounding the droplets are
not shown for clarity. The number of contacts, NC (see Methods), decreases from left
to right, with E1 corresponding to the
original configuration and E7 to the final
configuration obtained within the accelerated dynamics framework.

The fragmentation process is fundamentally different
when the emulsion
droplet is stabilized with either Janus or homogeneous NPs (cf. Figure 1b,c). As the particles remain strongly adsorbed at the interface
during fragmentation, forming a close-packed monolayer, the emulsion
nanodroplet fragments forming first a liquid bridge similar to the
one observed in the bare droplet (configuration E2 in Figure 1).

Progressively, the particles located at the fragmentation
edge
actively control the process. For instance, they decrease the number
of contacts between mother and daughter droplets. As shown in Figure 2, these edging NPs
control the shape of the bridge between the 2 droplets, behaving like
nanoscale razors, and transform the liquid bridge in bridging filaments.
Finally, the bridging filaments vanish and mother and daughter emulsion
droplets separate.

self-fragmentation
process of the emulsion droplet armored with Janus NPs. (a) The edging
NPs separating mother and daughter droplets are colored in red. The
particles which are not involved in the fragmentation process are
colored in gray. (b) Illustration of the filament bridge formed in
the necking breakup mechanism when the particles in panel (a) are

shown for clarity.

When the armored nanodroplet
is coated with Janus NPs (Figure 1b), their hydrophobic
regions interact with the daughter droplet, pushing it further away
from the mother droplet. The final configuration is fundamentally
different when the water nanodroplet is stabilized with homogeneous
NPs (Figure 1c). Their
specific feature allows the edging homogeneous NPs to adsorb both
at the mother and daughter droplet interfaces once they are separated,
resulting in bridging.39 As the distance
between mother and daughter droplets is not sufficiently large, the
fragmented emulsion droplets can coalesce.

The breakup mechanism
just discussed is quantitatively investigated
in Figure 3 (left panels),
where we show the evolution of a representative set of minimal distances, dmin, measured between the edging NPs separating
mother and daughter nanodroplets as a function of the number of contacts, NC, between the water molecules in each droplets.
The initial distributions of the minimal distances can be described
with Gaussian distributions for both Janus (J) and homogeneous (H)
NPs. The values of the respective means, μJ and μH, and standard deviations, σJ and σH, differ due to the NP features. We obtain μJ = 3.96 nm and μH = 4.02 nm and σJ = 0.03 nm and σH = 0.02 nm. As the number of contacts NC between mother and daughter droplets coated
with Janus NPs decreases, the minimal distances between the edging
NPs show two distinct regimes separated with a transition at NC* ≈ 5. When NC > NC*, dmin decreases slowly as the liquid bridge forms,
similar to the one observed in the bare droplet. When NC ≈ NC*, dmin shows
a significant jump which is characteristic of the transition from
the liquid bridge to the bridging filaments shown in Figure 2. When NC < NC*, dmin decreases
continuously until the bridging filaments vanish at NC† ≈
1 and mother and daughter droplets separate. For NC < NC†, dmin increases
slightly until a plateau is reached, which is characteristic of the
local rearrangement of the edging NPs near the fragmentation area.
The evolution of the system is qualitatively similar when homogeneous
NPs are present, albeit some subtle differences emerge due to the
NP features. As shown in Figure 3, two distinct behaviors are observed. Unlike Janus
edging NPs, certain homogeneous NPs do not present a distance dmin showing a significant jump when NC = NC*, but follow a relatively small and continuous
decrease for NC† < NC. The rest of the evolution is similar to the one observed for Janus
NPs, with the continuous increase of dmin to the plateau characteristic of the local equilibrium rearrangement
of the edging NPs.

Figure 3 Evolution of the representative minimal distances dmin (left panels) measured between the edging
NPs and
the representative three-phase contact angles θC (right
panels) of Janus (JP) and homogeneous (HP) edging NPs as a function
of the number of contacts NC between mother
and daughter droplets (see Methods). The letters
P and A are used to differentiate the NPs which play a passive and
an active role in the breakup mechanism, respectively. The statistical
errors are estimated as 1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean as
obtained for equilibrated trajectories. The values dmin and θC of a representative NP far
from the fragmentation area are plotted in dashed line for reference.

This analysis can be completed by quantifying the
evolution of
the three-phase contact angles, θC, of the edging
NPs, as shown in Figure 3 (right panels). The initial distribution can be described with Gaussian
distributions for both Janus (J) and homogeneous (H) NPs, with respective
means and standard deviations μJ = 89.1° and
μH = 97.5° and σJ = 1.6°
and σH = 3.5°. As the number of contacts NC between mother and daughter droplets coated
either with Janus or homogeneous NPs decreases, two distinct behaviors
emerged, which could discriminate the active or passive role played
by the edging NPs in the self-fragmentation process. When NC > NC*, the three-phase contact angle
decreases
slowly as the liquid bridge forms. When NC† < NC < NC*, we observe two different evolutions
of the contact angle. Some NPs show a continuous and significant decrease
of θC, with a decrease of ≈20% (index A in Figure 3) and ≈50%
(index A* in Figure 3). This behavior is representative of the active role played by some
edging NPs which behave like nanoscale razors. Eventually, the bridging
filaments vanish when NC = NC† and
mother and daughter droplets separate for NC† < NC. This step is characterized by a significant
increase of the contact angle until it reaches a plateau associated
with the local rearrangement of the edging NPs resulting in higher
values of the contact angles near the fragmentation area. In contrast,
some edging NPs show an increase of their contact angle when NC < NC*, until it reaches the plateau,
characteristic of their passive role during the breakup mechanism
(index P in Figure 3).

Building on accelerated dynamics frameworks,34 we assessed the free-energy of self-fragmentation
for bare
and armored nanodroplets. Considering first the bare droplet, we obtained
ΔFB = 445 ± 3 kcal/mol. This
value can be compared with the expression of the Gibbs free-energy,40 ΔF = γΔA, where γ and ΔA are the liquid–liquid
interfacial tension and the change in interfacial area, respectively.
Taking into account the effect of the curvature of the emulsion nanodroplet,31,41 one must consider γ = γ0/(1 + 2δ/RS), where γ0, RS, and δ are the planar interfacial tension, the
radius of the surface under tension, and the Tolman length, respectively.
Given the interfacial tension for a planar decane/water interface,42 γ0 = 51.7 mN·m–1, we obtained ΔF0 = 467 ±
5 kcal/mol, which yields the value of the Tolman length δ ≈
10–8 cm, in agreement with the original paper of
Tolman.31 Noticeably, this latter result
was directly obtained from our simulations and not as a condition
imposed where a definition of surface density profiles is needed in
atomistic descriptions.

In Figure 4, we
compared this result with the free-energy of self-fragmentation for
the armored nanodroplets, ΔFJ and
ΔFH, respectively, also obtained
within the accelerated dynamics framework. As we could expect from
the quantitative analysis above, which highlighted the active role
played by the finite-size NPs in the breakup mechanism, we measured
ΔFJ = 316 ± 7 kcal/mol and
ΔFH = 227 ± 3 kcal/mol, significantly
lower than the free-energy of self-fragmentation measured for the
bare nanodroplet. Furthermore, particle adsorption at the two interfaces
when homogeneous NPs are present must be taken into account to estimate
the fragmentation free-energy. To do so, we measured the three-phase
contact angle of the edging NPs and defined the final fragmentation
stage as the one where the edging NPs remain adsorbed at a single
interface. In Figure 5, we show the evolution of the representative three-phase contact
angles of the edging NPs with respect to the daughter droplet as the
fragmentation process progresses from stage E4 to E7, as shown in Figure 1. As the edging particles HP1 and HP2 are fully desorbed when the number of
contacts NC ≈ 10–2, with a three-phase contact angle θC = 180°,
two particles, HP3 and HP4, have a contact angle
θC < 180° characteristic of particles partially
adsorbed at the daughter interface. In the Pieranski–Binks
approach,35,43 the change in energy accompanying the desorption
of a spherical particle from the interface to either bulk phase can
be approximated by ΔE = πr2γ0(1 ± cos θ)2, where r is the particle radius and the plus (minus)
sign refers to desorption into oil (water). Even if this expression
assumes that the oil–water interface remains planar, it yields
a rough approximation of the energy at play. Considering the contact
angles given in Figure 5, we obtain a correction factor ΔΔFH ≈ 5 kcal/mol.

Figure 4 Free-energy profiles associated with thermally
assisted self-fragmentation
of bare and armored droplets as a function of the number of contacts NC between mother and daughter droplets (see Methods). The Gibbs free-energy calculated without
the Tolman correction is shown as a dashed horizontal line. The positions
of the global minima of the bare and armored droplets along NC differ due to the presence of the particles.

Figure 5 Representative three-phase contact angles θC of
the homogeneous (HP) edging NPs with respect to the daughter droplet
as the fragmentation process progresses from stage E4 to E7 as a function
of the continuous number of contacts NC between mother and daughter droplets (see Methods). The statistical errors are estimated as 1 SD from the mean for
equilibrated trajectories.

Interestingly, the difference in chemistry of the spherical NPs
had some important impact in the reduction of the free-energy barrier.
Unlike Janus NPs, which present a preferred orientation at the liquid–liquid
interface resulting in restricted rotational mobility, homogeneous
NPs are characterized by larger rotational freedom. This provides
the homogeneous NPs with the capability to share the interfacial area
delimiting mother and daughter nanodroplets during the fragmentation
process. In contrast, when Janus NPs are present, the main energy
consumption comes from the daughter droplet trying to maintain the
orientation of the edging NPs, thus increasing the free-energy of
self-fragmentation.

Conclusions
The physical insights
discussed here provide a deeper understanding
of the organization of finite-size NPs at fluid interfaces and allow
us to decipher the active or passive role played by such particles
in the self-fragmentation process. This information could be useful
for a variety of applications including multifunctional biomaterial
design and tuning of signaling pathways in mechanistic biology, such
as membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles during apoptosis.44−46 Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is a highly regulated
and controlled biological process,47 which
can alter organelle structure and function.44 Its original role is to kill infected, abnormal, or otherwise undesired
cells. There is a long list of diseases associated with altered cell
survival. Increased apoptosis is characteristic of AIDS and neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Decreased
or inhibited apoptosis, on the other hand, is a feature of many malignancies,
autoimmune disorders, and some viral infections.48 For instance, increasing evidence suggests that cell-derived
extracellular vesicles (EV) produced during apoptosis have important
immune regulatory roles relevant across different disease settings.49 The formation of EVs during apoptosis could
be a key mechanism of immune modulation. With most cancer treatments
focusing on inducing apoptosis in tumor cells,50 it becomes important to understand selective ways to influence
cell differentiation and death. Nanoscale chemistry and topography
could act synergistically for better understanding hidden mechanisms
of nanomaterial-induced cell behaviors. From this perspective, emulsion
droplets can promote open thinking about how nonliving matter might
self-organize into evolving matter that adapts over time to a changing
environment. However, directly sampling experimentally the role played
by NPs remains challenging. Despite these difficulties, Pak et al.51 recently suggested it
is possible to quantify the active implication of NPs on emulsification
processes. This and other experimental setups could shed light on
the richness of the self-fragmentation process discussed here and
advance the study of much more complex phenomena associated with various
physicochemical conditions.

The extensive simulations discussed
above allowed us to unravel
thermally assisted self-fragmention of armored nanodroplet along with
the mechanisms at play in the necking breakup process. We showed that
finite-size NPs can play an active role, behaving like nanoscale razors,
during the evolution of the droplet shape and affect strongly the
stability of the system, resulting in significant reduction of the
fragmentation free-energy ranging between 150 and 250 kcal/mol, which
is equivalent to the energy released by 20–30 ATP molecules.52 The relatively small size of the mother droplet
considered in this work (≈ 10 nm in diameter) comes from computational
limitations due to dynamical labeling of the fluid molecules. Nevertheless,
the DPD framework, along with continuously increasing computational
power, would allow extending these results to a range of bioinspired
liquid–liquid systems where the adsorption of the particles
does not lead to a significant deformation of the interface. This
is a valid approximation for particles and emulsion droplets ranging
from nanometer to micrometer size.32 The
results presented here also suggest that the effect of particle adsorption
energy and particle density coverage affects particles’ ability
to fragment the emulsion droplet. For instance, increasing the initial
three-phase contact angles and/or the particles’ surface density
would affect the formation of filaments, eventually yielding the formation
of the liquid bridge observed in the fragmentation of the bare emulsion
droplet. These observations might be of relevance for the control
and/or tuning of the fragmentation of cell-derived extracellular vesicles,
which have important immune regulatory roles,46 and bacterial membrane vesicles that affect diverse biological processes,
including virulence, phage infection, and cell-to-cell communication.53 They might also enhance the design of nanoscale
platforms in synthetic biology to modify the molecular workings of
enveloped viruses such as the rapidly spreading Zika virus whose recent
outbreak has been linked to microcephaly and Guillain-Barré
syndrome.22−24

Methods
Dynamical Coordination
Number
To take into account
the inherent fluid nature of the system, that is, the absence of covalent
interactions between the molecules of the fluids, we designed a dynamic
collective variable (CV) which allowed us to bias unequivocally the
dynamics of the system based on dynamical labeling the fluid molecules
composing mother and daughter droplets resulting from the self-fragmentation
process. In this optic, we considered the MULTICOLVAR module of the
plugin for free-energy calculation, PLUMED, version 2.3.54We first
arbitrarily aligned the principal axis of deformation
of the system with the Z-Cartesian axis of the DPD
simulation box.

We settled the fragmentation
center as our reference
position in the Cartesian space using a virtual atom in a fixed position
with the FIXEDATOM function available in PLUMED.54

We used the function ZDISTANCES
to calculate the Z-components of the vectors connecting
the fluid molecules
constituting the droplet and the fragmentation center.

We filtered the distribution of distances obtained with
the ZDISTANCES function to dynamically discriminate the molecules
located on the right (left) side of the fragmentation center. To do
so, we used the function MFILTER_MORE (MFILTER_LESS) implemented in
PLUMED54 to create these two dynamic groups.

Thereafter, we fixed the number of molecules
constituting
mother and daughter droplets. To do so, we used the RESTRAINT function
implemented in PLUMED54 which can add harmonic
and/or linear restaints on specific CVs. We applied the RESTRAINT
function on two dynamic groups defined with the options LESS_THAN
and MORE_THAN implemented in the ZDISTANCES function.

We computed the number of contacts, NC, between the two dynamic groups previously defined with
MFILTER_MORE and MFILTER_LESS using the function COORDINATIONNUMBER
implemented in PLUMED.54 This variable
counts the number of contacts between two groups of atoms and is defined
as NC = ∑i∑jsij, where sij = 1 if the contact between atoms i and j is formed and sij = 0 otherwise. To make NC differentiable, sij is replaced with a switching
function. We considered the RATIONAL switching function , where n = 6 and m = 12. We choose D0 = 0.6375
nm, as obtained from the position of the first peak of the radial
distribution function calculated from the distances between the fluid
molecules, which corresponds to the first coordination shell of the
system.54 We then tuned the value of the
parameter R0 = 0.8625 nm to allow the
daughter droplet to separate completely from the mother droplet during
fragmentation.

Finally, we defined the
continuous number of contacts
as the mean value of the COORDINATIONNUMBER discussed above. To do
so, we used the MEAN option implemented in the MULTICOLVAR module
available in PLUMED.54
