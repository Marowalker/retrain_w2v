Globally
ordered colloidal crystal lattices have broad utility
in a wide range of optical and catalytic devices, for example, as
photonic band gap materials. However, the self-assembly of stereospecific
structures is often confounded by polymorphism. Small free-energy
differences often characterize ensembles of different structures,
making it difficult to produce a single morphology at will. Current
techniques to handle this problem adopt one of two approaches: that
of the “top-down” or “bottom-up” methodology,
whereby structures are engineered starting from the largest or smallest
relevant length scales, respectively. However, recently, a third approach
for directing high fidelity assembly of colloidal crystals has been
suggested which relies on the introduction of polymer cosolutes into
the crystal phase [Mahynski, N.; Panagiotopoulos, A. Z.; Meng, D.;
Kumar, S. K. Nat. Commun.2014, 5, 4472]. By tuning the polymer’s morphology to interact
uniquely with the void symmetry of a single desired crystal, the entropy
loss associated with polymer confinement has been shown to strongly
bias the formation of that phase. However, previously, this approach
has only been demonstrated in the limiting case of close-packed crystals.
Here, we show how this approach may be generalized and extended to
complex open crystals, illustrating the utility of this “structure-directing
agent” paradigm in engineering the nanoscale structure of ordered
colloidal materials. The high degree of transferability of this paradigm’s
basic principles between relatively simple crystals and more complex
ones suggests that this represents a valuable addition to presently
known self-assembly techniques.

The ability
to intelligently
direct the self-assembly of ordered materials at and below the micrometer
length scale is the cornerstone of numerous modern technologies. It
is a necessity in designing zeolite frameworks in the chemical industry,1−4 biomimetic scaffolding used to grow artificial organs with stem
cells,5 and crystal lattices for optical
applications.6,7 Crystallization of colloidal suspensions
often provides a direct route to some of these technologies; however,
precise control during this phase transformation is usually difficult
to achieve. The reason is that many crystals naturally form defects
and exhibit polymorphism, where very closely related structures are
separated by only a small free-energy difference. Two broad paradigms
currently exist concerning control over colloidal crystal habit and
polymorphism. In the “top-down” approach, a planar template
or some other external guiding force is used to bias the formation
of a specific crystal.4,8,9 In
such a case, the information about the final state of the system is
“programmed” into the morphology of the template. Unfortunately,
this is far from a panacea as this template must be made uniquely
commensurate with a face of the desired crystal present in only that
form and is therefore highly system-dependent.

Alternatively,
this information can be encoded in the colloids
themselves in the so-called “bottom-up” approach, where
anisotropy in the shape, symmetry, and surface interactions of the
colloids can be tuned to target a desired structure.10−12 While this approach is attractive, its kinetics are subject to the
smoothness of the free-energy landscape connecting competing forms
and can be sensitive to small changes in the surface anisotropy.10,13−17 Therefore, experimental realizations are subject to the fidelity
of the synthesis protocol used to manufacture the constituent colloids.

Following queues from biological systems, one can imagine another
alternative where this information is instead encoded into entirely
separate molecular “chaperones” that guide the assembly
process. Indeed, the utility of small cosolute molecules, or “structure-directing
agents” (SDA), for the directed synthesis of zeolites and other
microporous structures is already well-appreciated.2,3,18,19 For instance,
the introduction of organic polycations during the growth of siliceous
ZSM-5 catalysts has been shown to control the morphology of the resulting
crystallite.2 This is believed to be a
function of the way in which the nitrogen center on the amine positions
itself at junctures between pores, while the aliphatic arms reside
in the pores surrounding the juncture. By and large, the utility of
SDAs has been linked to the chemical (thermal) interaction between
the SDA and the porous material.2,20−22 To our knowledge, the assembly of colloidal crystals via SDAs has not been realized or even appreciated.

Recent simulations have revealed how polymers can be used as SDAs
to entropically bias the formation of specific hard-sphere polymorphs
during crystallization, such as the face-centered cubic (fcc) or hexagonal
close-packed (hcp) structures.23−25 This mechanism exploits the difference
in the interstitial void patterns between different crystals to amplify
the free-energy difference between them. By connecting an otherwise
pure colloid system to an athermal polymer reservoir at sufficiently
high osmotic pressure, the polymer both induces crystallization of
the colloids in a close-packed structure via depletion
effects26−28 and partitions itself into the resulting crystal
(cf. top row of Figure 1). Since the entropy cost of polymer confinement is strongly dependent
on how complementary the polymer morphology and internal void structure
of a crystal are, the polymer’s average shape offers a simple
design parameter which can be used to tune the relative stability
of one crystal over other competing forms. Thus, the efficacy of this
approach hinges on the ability of the polymer to invade the interstices
of the crystal phase without destabilizing it. In this approach to
colloidal crystal assembly, the polymer cosolute, whose architecture
and conformation can be finely controlled, effectively behaves as
a SDA. However, its control is entirely entropically driven rather
than enthalpically.

Figure 1 Schematic of the assembly paradigm in which a suspension
of otherwise
repulsive colloids is connected to a polymer reservoir where the polymer’s
morphology is selected such that, when partitioned into the colloidal
crystal at sufficient osmotic pressure, its morphology is commensurate
with the local void symmetry found exclusively in one polymorph or
another. (Top) This assembly route is purely based on the entropy
loss of the polymer when adsorbed in a given crystal and has been
previously shown to strongly bias the formation of one of the competing
cubic and hexagonal polymorphic forms of close-packed crystals. (Bottom)
By introducing thermal interactions between the colloids, it is plausible
that a combination of colloidal energy and polymer entropy in the
resulting crystal phase could be used to produce much more complex
crystal morphologies in an intelligent fashion. In this work, we consider
tetrastack crystals which are akin to close-packed ones in the sense
that they have an identical topological distribution of octahedral
voids (OV) and tetrahedral voids (TV) between different polymorphs.

This technique seems thermodynamically
versatile as it depends
only on the conformation of the polymer, and its kinetics are controlled
simply by the polymers’ bulk concentration (degree of partitioning
into the crystal phase), offering what would appear to be complete
control over the crystallization and annealing process. However, the
generality of this SDA approach hinges on its ability to be deployed
to bias the formation of complex, arbitrary crystal structures into
which there is no guarantee the polymer will partition without destabilizing
the structure. Previous work has only demonstrated control over the
relative stability of close-packed crystals.23,25 In this work, we show that this approach can, indeed, be employed
to stabilize non-close-packed structures, thereby suggesting that
this method could provide the foundations of a different paradigm
for the assembly of colloidal crystals. Due to the entropic nature
of polymer-induced depletion interactions in these mixtures, in previous
work, the polymer SDA was responsible for inducing both crystallization
(which exclusively results in close-packed morphologies) as well as
polymorph selection. Here, we decouple the driving forces for each
phenomenon, combining an entropic polymorphic selection mechanism
with an energetically driven crystallization one. The latter is in
the spirit of the second paradigm previously discussed but is often
incapable, on its own, of producing colloidal crystals with sufficient
long-range order to be technologically relevant. This hybrid approach
amounts to a linear combination of the two factors contributing to
the free energy of the state of the system, energy and entropy, where
their relative contributions can be modulated via temperature (cf. Figure 1). This work demonstrates the fruitfulness of this combined
approach in producing open colloidal crystals of a single polymorphic
form. We illustrate how observations from close-packed systems can
be easily extended to understand the assembly of more complex crystals,
opening alternative avenues for engineering assembly pathways and
experimental protocols to produce large-scale colloidal crystals relevant
for a variety of applications.

Results and Discussion
Open colloidal
crystals have lattice constants comparable to the
wavelength of light, making them good candidate materials for photonic
applications.29−31 In this work, we consider the crystallization of
triblock Janus colloids, that is, colloids decorated with two circular
polar patches. Experimental work has demonstrated that the synthesis
of these building blocks can be precise enough to make the self-assembly
of crystals possible.12 However, this system
is a prototypical instance of a crystallizing colloidal system whose
resulting morphology is difficult to control via patch
chemistry alone. Indeed, self-assembly is strongly affected by defects
arising from polymorphism between cubic and hexagonal forms and has
degenerate noncrystalline structures (clathrates).16 Romano and Sciortino16 have
shown that specific polymorphs can be stabilized by finely tuning
the shape of the polar patches, but patterning the surface of the
particles with the required degree of precision is currently beyond
experimental capabilities. Therefore, this system is an attractive
platform on which to rigorously test the merit of polymers as an experimentally
realizable SDA paradigm. In the pure colloidal system, each colloid
has two spherically symmetric patches placed on the poles. If the
size of the patches is chosen in such a way that each particle can
have a maximum of six bonded partners, at low temperature, these colloids
crystallize into tetrastacks, depicted in Figure 1. These crystals exhibit a cubic and hexagonal
polymorphism analogous to that of hard spheres that form close-packed
structures. The interstices in these close-packed crystals can be
described as being either octahedral voids (OV) or tetrahedral voids
(TV), which can be visualized by connecting the centers of mass of
neighboring colloids. The edge length of these platonic shapes is
the diameter of a single colloid. In the fcc crystal, all OVs are
entirely surrounded by TVs and vice versa, whereas
in the hcp, the OVs share faces and stack in columns (cf. Figure 1). In fact, the voids
of the tetrastack polymorphs have a topology identical to that of
their close-packed counterparts; however, the edge length of these
polyhedra is now twice as long. Because the OVs enclose roughly 6
times the volume as the TVs, in the hexagonal polymorph, an adsorbed
linear polymer of sufficient size will spread itself between pairs
of cavernous OVs. By contrast, in the cubic polymorph, the same polymer
will experience more confinement as it must spread between an octahedron
and a tetrahedron. In close-packed crystals, this confinement can
strongly bias the formation of the hexagonal phase by amplifying the
free energy difference between the two polymorphs by 3 orders of magnitude
over a system of pure colloids.23,32,33

Stability
Predicted from Monte Carlo Simulations
Polymer
SDAs bias the formation of a specific crystal polymorph by having
a lower specific free energy, or chemical potential, when confined
in that crystal over competing forms.23 Thus, we begin by considering the total difference in the free energy,
Δμ/kBT =
(μcub – μhex)/kBT, of a linear, fully flexible homopolymer
confined in each of the two tetrastack polymorphs that form spontaneously
at low temperature. The total difference in the free energy of a single
confined polymer between the two crystals plateaus to roughly 0.1 kBT, in favor of the hexagonal
polymorph, but decreases by up to an order of magnitude as the colloid
to monomer size ratio increases (cf. Supporting Information Figure S1). In close-packed crystals, this difference
is much larger, Δμ/kBT > 2.23 While it is plausible
that such a difference could yield a detectable shift in the relative
amount of the hexagonal polymorph produced in an experimental realization,
we would like to improve upon this. In order to amplify Δμ/kBT, the polymer must be able
to better detect differences between the local interstitial environments
in the crystals. We achieved this by making the polymer more compact,
that is, by converting the linear polymers into star polymers. Indeed, Figure 2 illustrates that
as we increase the functionality, or number of arms, on the polymer
from f = 2 (linear homopolymer) to f = 8, the difference in free energy of an adsorbed polymer between
the polymorphs is amplified by more than an order of magnitude. This
maximum difference is achieved near q = 2Rg/σc ≈ 1.3, where Rg is the star polymer’s radius of gyration
and σc is the colloid diameter. Thus, q quantifies the relative size of the polymer and the colloids. In
close-packed crystals with confined linear homopolymers, this maximum
has been found at q ≈ 0.71.23 Again, this difference is due to the distribution of the
polymer between neighboring voids, which in the hexagonal polymorph
corresponds to a pair of large neighboring OVs, while in the cubic
polymorph, it is always a set of one large OV and one small TV (cf. Supporting Information Figure S2). Compared to
close-packed crystals, tetrastacks have an identical topological distribution
of voids but the edge length of each void, and therefore distance
between the centers of each, is twice as large. Consequently, in tetrastacks
we a priori expect this maximum difference to occur
at q ≈ 2 × 0.71, which is indeed observed.

Figure 2 Relative
stability of tetrastack polymorphs in the presence of
star polymers as predicted by Monte Carlo simulation. (a) Depiction
of the cubic tetrastack crystal color-coded to illustrate the “ABC”
stacking pattern. Each layer comprises tetrahedral sets of colloids
packed in a hexagonal arrangement stacked out of the plane of the
image in an alternating fashion, which is successively repeated to
produce the macroscopic crystal. (b) Hexagonal polymorph is shown
color-coded to illustrate the “ABAB” stacking pattern
out of the plane. The visible gaps in the crystal correspond to octahedral
voids which are stacked out of the plane shown. (c) Difference in
the chemical potential of a given polymer confined in the two polymorphs,
where Δμ = μcub – μhex, thus a positive Δμ corresponds to a lower
free energy (higher stability) of the polymer when confined in the
hexagonal polymorph. These simulations were performed with full monomeric
resolution so that each point corresponds to a star, with a total
of f arms, where the length of each arm, Marm, is increased by one monomer. (d) Δμ/kBT for coarse-grained high
functionality star polymers as the overall size of the star, q, increases. Both the local maxima and minima in q are observed for all stars, as in the case of fully detailed
simulations of low functionality stars in close-packed polymorphs.25

Since computationally it is intractably expensive to accurately
sample all monomeric degrees of freedom of large star polymers when
confined in a crystal, we now turn to a coarse-grained model, which
treats the star polymers as a single soft sphere. Qualitatively identical
results are obtained with this model, but the magnitude of the effect
is relatively underestimated. Comparing the maximum in Δμ
for f = 8 from the detailed simulations with that
of f = 10 from the coarse-grained model, it is apparent
that the coarse-grained model underpredicts the difference by roughly
a factor of 2. This is not entirely unexpected. Even in close-packed
crystals, simulations with explicit monomer detail have shown that
a star’s corona deforms significantly and anisotropically under
such confinement due to simultaneous interaction with multiple colloids.25,34,35 The coarse-grained model struggles
to quantitatively capture this effect because it was derived in the
limit that the corona has a homogeneous angular monomer distribution.
This causes the maximum in Δμ to shift to slightly higher q, an effect which increases with f. Coarse-grained
stars do not fully account for volume conservation of the monomer
corona when invaded by overlapping colloids; thus, when confined in
a crystal, they must be made marginally larger to reach a size that
fully detailed monomer simulations already account for. This effect
is rather small, and the qualitative behavior of Δμ as
a function of q is well captured, displaying a prominent
local maximum where the hexagonal polymorph is strongly favored due
to neighboring OVs, followed by a curious minimum at q ≈ 3. In fact, this minimum has been observed for star polymers
confined in close-packed crystals, as well.25 Extrapolating the minimum in Δμ at q = 3 reveals that Δμ becomes negative at f ≈ 8 (cf. Supporting Information). This is consistent with the results found for low functionality
stars in close-packed crystals, where this change in the sign of Δμ
corresponds to a translocation of the star polymer’s core from
an OV to a TV.25 As a star grows, eventually
the entropic considerations of its corona outweigh that of its core,
causing the core to shift from a large OV into a smaller TV if confined
in the cubic polymorph. This is because all TVs in the cubic polymorph
are surrounded by large OVs, meaning the corona gains more free volume
when the core can position itself to access this pseudospherical symmetry
(cf. Figure 1). The
hexagonal form does not have such a fortuitous arrangement of OVs
and thus becomes less stable than the cubic form.

Thus, we find
that observations from close-packed systems in the
presence of linear homopolymer SDAs are reproduced in tetrastack systems
with star polymers. The qualitative maximum in the bias for the hexagonal
polymorph, Δμ, occurs when the SDA spreads between pairs
of neighboring voids, due to the increased accessible volume in the
hexagonal polymorph due to its arrangement of large OVs. This is followed
by a minimum, which can become negative at very low f, due to the competition between the core and corona entropy of the
star polymer. This competition is minimized by the way the cubic polymorph
surrounds each TV completely by large OVs. The magnitude of these
effects depends on the properties of the SDA; however, the location
of these effects is dependent only on the size and separation of the
voids, which scales linearly with the edge length of the void polyhedron.
This complete transferability demonstrates that this SDA paradigm
for polymorph selection is not a specific effect observed only in
simple close-packed crystals but can be fruitfully applied to more
general systems.

Molecular Dynamics Realizations
The Monte Carlo calculations
performed in the previous section are based on single-particle insertions
and hence do not take into account many-body effects that could play
a substantial role in determining the relative stability of bulk phases.
Going one step further, we studied the crystallization of triblock
Janus particles in pure systems as well as in mixtures with star polymers
using constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. We modeled
the colloid–colloid interaction with a continuous version of
the model employed by Romano and Sciortino16 (see Figure 3a),
the star–colloid interaction with the coarse-grained potentials
developed in ref (36), and the star–star interaction with the coarse-grained potentials
derived by Likos and co-workers.37 We analyzed
the resulting configurations by classifying colloids according to
their local symmetry, as determined by Steinhardt–Nelson bond
order parameters (cf. Methods).38 In what follows, we will focus on stabilizing
the hexagonal tetrastack polymorph which, as predicted by Monte Carlo
results, can be strongly favored by mixing colloids with large star
polymers.

Figure 3 Molecular dynamics simulation snapshots of triblock Janus particles.
(a) Triblock Janus colloid modeled as a particle with two spherical
polar patches (in blue). When two patches of different colloids are
close to each other, the two colloids feel a net attraction whose
magnitude depends on their relative distance and orientations (cf. Methods for the functional form of the potential).
(b–d) Simulation snapshots where only crystalline colloids
are shown (cf. Methods). Particles are color-coded
according to the local environment: green (red) particles are in a
cubic (hexagonal) local environment, while yellow particles are in
a mixed environment. Patches are depicted in blue. (b) Snapshot of
a pure colloidal system. The majority of the particles are in a crystallite
formed by randomly stacking hexagonal and cubic layers. (c,d) Snapshot
of simulations of a binary mixture of patchy particles and star polymers
with f = 30 and q = 1.5. In (c),
the relatively small star–star repulsion makes the system undergo
a demixing transition, which pushes the colloids close to each other,
forming a close-packed crystal. In (d), the same simulation was performed
with charged star polymers, which experience a higher mutual repulsion
that stabilizes open structures and biases the formation of the hexagonal
tetrastack polymorph. As a consequence, nearly all crystalline particles
are in a locally hexagonal environment.

Simulating the pure colloidal system at low temperatures
and moderate
densities always yielded a polymorphic crystal, that is, a crystal
with stacking faults, as shown in Figure 3b. The snapshot exhibits a clear lack of
long-range order. As suggested by Monte Carlo results, star polymers
could be used to select the hexagonal polymorph. However, the choice
of q and f is a delicate matter.
On one hand, Monte Carlo results clearly indicate that the higher
the f the better, whereas an optimal q value should lie in the range [1.4,1.8]. On the other hand, the
biasing provided by the star polymers relies on them being able to
explore the void distribution of the crystals, meaning that the colloid–star
binary mixture should not be prone to demixing. As noted in ref (36), the tendency to demix
can be estimated by performing a mapping of the system to an effective
nonadditive hard-sphere binary mixture. Under this assumption, the
stability of the star–colloid system against demixing is qualitatively
controlled by the nonadditivity parameter Δ, defined as 1  where σij is the effective hard-sphere diameter between particles of
species i and j, which we obtained
through the
Barker–Henderson approximation.39 Negative values of the nonadditivity parameter favor mixing between
different species, while positive values of Δ may indicate a
tendency to demix, provided that the densities of both species exceed
certain thresholds that are, in turn, Δ-dependent.40,41 We note that the results contained in ref (36) show that mixtures of
colloids and stars with q ≈ 1.5 and f ≳ 20 always have Δ ≳ 0, indicating
a possible instability with respect to demixing. However, this approach
is known to be quantitatively inaccurate especially for relatively
small f and cannot be relied upon to estimate the
parameters for which demixing occurs.35 A numerical check is thus required. We performed simulations of
a mixture of colloids and star polymers with f =
30 and q = 1.5, for which Monte Carlo results predict
a free-energy difference between the hexagonal and cubic tetrastacks,
Δμ/kBT ≈
3.5 per star polymer adsorbed. In principle, such a large value makes
it possible to clearly detect the predicted entropic effect in simulations.
Unfortunately, we observed that as soon as the density of the stars
becomes appreciable, the system demixes and the colloids assemble
into close-packed crystals, as shown in Figure 3c. The net effect of the star polymers is
thus to suppress the formation of low-density phases characteristic
of patchy particles. Increasing f only further increases
Δ, while increasing q provides only a marginal
reduction.36 In all cases, the energetically
degenerate clathrate structures were also suppressed in favor of one
or more crystals.

Therefore, to observe this SDA-driven polymorphic
biasing, one
must have a system in which Δμ/kBT is of the desired sign and the nonadditivity
parameter is sufficiently small to avoid demixing and subsequent collapse
of the low-density crystal phase. Since σsc and σcc are fixed, the former by the polymorph free-energy difference
one wants to enforce and the latter by the size ratio q, the only way to enhance the tendency to mix of stars and colloids
is to increase the star–star interaction (cf. eq 1). It is advantageous that the class
of soft colloids is very rich, and it includes a variety of polymer-based
colloids, offering flexibility in the control of their interactions.
In particular, by employing polymers with ionizable units and changing
the pH of the solution, one can control the charge on the polymer
chains, creating thereby polyelectrolyte stars.42 By charging the stars, while at the same time keeping the
colloids neutral, it is possible to enhance the star–star repulsion
without significantly affecting the other interactions. The interstar
repulsion in the presence of charge also exhibits a Yukawa tail at
non-overlapping distances, which is controlled by salinity and can
be thus tuned to yield a Yukawa decay length the same as that of the
neutral stars. The amplitude of the repulsion is controlled essentially
by the overall valency Z of the star.43 Accordingly, charging up the stars is equivalent
to multiplying their mutual repulsion by a factor of α, which
depends solely on the charge Z and the star polymer’s
diameter, and can be used to tune Δ. In the q = 1.5, f = 30 case, the nonadditivity parameter,
which is a monotonically decreasing function of α, takes the
value Δ ≈ 0.22 in the neutral case and quickly drops
to zero for α ≳ 7.8. As an example, we considered mixtures
with α = 6.5, for which Δ ≈ 0.016 and which can
be realized by employing stars that are polyelectrolytes containing
a few hundred elementary charges, depending on the diameter (cf. Supporting Information). Under such conditions,
we successfully observed the formation of hexagonal tetrastack crystals
as predicted by Monte Carlo calculations. A typical snapshot of the
final configuration of a crystallized sample is presented in Figure 3d, which shows a
crystallite that does not contain any randomly stacked layers, with
nearly all the particles in a locally hexagonal environment.

In order to prove that the hexagonal polymorph is indeed the most
stable one and not merely a metastable intermediate, we also performed
annealing simulations. These simulations were started from configurations
in which all the colloids were initially on a perfect cubic tetrastack
lattice and the star polymers were randomly placed throughout the
sample. The results, as well as representative snapshots, are shown
in Figure 4. During
the full course of the simulation, we observed complete annealing
of the cubic tetrastack into the hexagonal one. Indeed, ⟨q4⟩ decreases monotonically to the value
associated with the hexagonal polymorph, and its initial rapid descent
demonstrates that star polymers make the cubic tetrastack very unstable
with respect to the hexagonal one because no nucleation event is required
to start the annealing process. As shown in the snapshots, the hexagonal
polymorph grows directly on the surface of the cubic crystallite,
which slowly but steadily acquires a hexagonal morphology. The final
crystalline cluster, which has a long-range hexagonal symmetry, is
stable and does not undergo any further evolution with time. Similar
(partial or complete) annealing runs were obtained at different star
polymer densities and with stars containing a different number of
charges (shown in the Supporting Information), proving the robustness of this polymorph stabilization mechanism.
As an additional test, we also performed annealing simulations in
the presence of smaller stars (f = 30, q = 0.75) which, according to Monte Carlo results, should not affect
the stability of either polymorph. The resulting ⟨q4⟩ time series, plotted as the green and red curves
in Figure 4, are constant
throughout the simulation, confirming that the hexagonal and cubic
crystallites are not affected by the stars.

Figure 4 Evolution of patchy particle
crystals in molecular dynamics simulations.
The color coding is the same as that in Figure 3. Coarse-grained star polymers with f = 30, q = 1.5 and a star–star
repulsion increased by a factor of 6.5 due to electrostatic repulsion
can be employed to anneal a cubic tetrastack crystallite into a hexagonal
one. The snapshots (each of which refers to the point in the plot
indicated by the accompanying letter) demonstrate how the annealing
process takes place: the simulation starts from an initial configuration
where all colloids are arranged on a cubic tetrastack lattice and
the star polymers (which are shown only in the top-left picture) are
randomly distributed throughout the sample. As the simulation proceeds,
particles continuously detach from and reattach to the crystallite,
slowly annealing into a hexagonal crystal. The black line in the plot
shows the time dependence of the average bond order parameter ⟨q4⟩, which starts from the cubic tetrastack
value (green line, ⟨q4⟩c ≈ 0.513), decreases monotonically, and eventually
plateaus to a value very close to the hexagonal tetrastack one (red
line, ⟨q4⟩h ≈
0.172). The small difference between the two values is due to a few
(2–3) particles that are still in a mixed environment. The
red (green) curve was obtained by simulating a hexagonal (cubic) crystallite
with smaller stars (q = 0.75) which, as predicted
by Monte Carlo calculations, do not affect the stability of either
polymorph.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated the validity of an alternative approach for
the directed self-assembly of high-fidelity complex colloidal crystals
that exploits polymers as structure-directing agents to thermodynamically
assign the most stable crystal structure from a suite of potential
competitors. This can be achieved purely by engineering the polymer’s
interactions with each other and with the colloids. Monte Carlo simulations
revealed that correlations between different voids due to different
symmetries between crystal structures are sufficient to amplify weak
inherent free-energy differences between polymorphs by several orders
of magnitude if the polymer is chosen wisely. We revealed how qualitative
inferences from Monte Carlo simulations on simple, close-packed crystals
are transferable to more complex ones and suggest how to make such
choices. Molecular dynamics simulations fully support Monte Carlo
predictions, validating the use of polymers as SDAs to entropically
stabilize complex, open colloidal crystals on the basis of their internal
void structure. The only caveat is that one must take care to avoid
destabilizing open crystals with respect to their close-packed counterparts
because, as the polymer density is increased, depletion effects tend
to stabilize more compact structures. To this end, we illustrated
that the most stable crystal structure can be tuned by two factors:
the difference in polymer free energy between different crystal structure
environments, Δμ/kBT, and the nonadditivity parameter, Δ. The former
reflects the relative amount of free volume a polymer can access inside
each crystal, while the latter reflects the capacity of a polymer
to invade the interstices of the crystal phase in the first place.
For close-packed crystals, the latter could be effectively controlled
by polymer density (osmotic pressure); however, additional polymer–polymer
interaction tuning is necessary to stabilize low-density crystals
over their close-packed analogues. Both Δμ/kBT and Δ can effectively be tuned
by changing the polymer size and charge, for a given colloidal system,
neither of which affect the intrinsic colloid–colloid interaction.
This opens additional pathways to engineering colloidal crystals as
this SDA-based mechanism can be deployed, not only independently but
also in parallel to other paradigmatic approaches which rely on energetic
interactions between the colloids themselves or between colloids and
some external medium. Although this approach does not solve all colloidal
crystal design problems, it serves to illustrate an alternative with
which to supplement existing approaches in cases where other strategies
might produce unsatisfactory results. We emphasize that the success
of the design logic itself for this set of crystal polymorphs is as
important as the results themselves, and we expect the heuristics
outlined here will serve as a guide to experimental realizations of
this phenomena in the near future.

Methods
Monomer-Resolved
Monte Carlo Simulations
Our simulated
star polymers were composed of f linear chains of
equal-sized monomer beads which at one end were bonded to a common
central monomer. Each monomer bead had a diameter of σm = 1.0, and each arm contained Marm beads,
each of which was bonded in sequence by the finitely extensible nonlinear
elastic potential:44 2  

We
employed the well-known Kremer–Grest
model, wherein k = 30ϵ, r0 = 1.5 were used to minimize bond crossings. A linear homopolymer
is simply a star polymer with a functionality of f = 2. All beads also interacted with each other, and with colloids,
through a shifted Lennard-Jones potential, which is cut and shifted
at the minimum. For equal-sized beads this is known as the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen
potential (WCA):45 3  

This potential has been shifted by a factor, Δij = (σi + σj)/2 – σm, which accounts for the difference in diameters between dissimilar
species such that the slope of the potential remains identical for
all pairs as they begin to overlap regardless of their individual
size. For the detailed MC simulations, colloids had a diameter of
σc = 6.0σm and were treated as purely
repulsive spheres without any patches since these patches do not interact
with monomer beads.

For these simulations T* = kBT/ϵ = 1,
however, since the interactions
are purely and steeply repulsive, the difference in the polymer’s
chemical potential between the two polymorphs was found to be invariant
when normalized by kBT, hence we always express the difference as Δμ/kBT to be consistent with the
temperature used in the molecular dynamics portion of this work, where kBT is reduced to crystallize
the colloids when attractive patches are present. Colloids were held
fixed for the duration of these simulations and were initialized on
either the cubic or hexagonal tetrastack lattice. The former was generated
in a periodic box with dimensions (Lx,Ly,Lz) = , which represents one complete “ABC”
stacking pattern in the z direction containing 48
tetrastacks or 192 total colloids. The latter was generated in a periodic
box with dimensions (Lx,Ly,Lz) = , which represents a pair of “AB”
stacks in the z direction containing 64 tetrastacks
or 256 total colloids. The additional spacing of 0.12 ≈ 21/6 – 1 between nearest neighbors was added because
the colloids interacted via the repulsive WCA potential
rather than as perfectly hard spheres. This additional gap results
in crystals with zero internal energy and configurational pressure,
as in previous work.23−25

To measure the chemical potential, or free
energy, of a single
star polymer confined in a given crystal, we employed incremental-growth
Monte Carlo simulations46 described in
more detail elsewhere.25 We briefly summarize
the technique here. Polymers were grown incrementally by attempting
to insert an additional “ghost” monomer onto a fully
inserted portion of the star at the end of each arm, from arm 1 to f. The fully inserted portion was relaxed in the canonical
ensemble between insertion attempts, and relaxation moves included
local displacements of monomers, displacements of the entire polymer’s
center of mass, and regrowth of all or parts of a randomly chosen
individual arm via Rosenbluth sampling.47 These moves typically occurred with a 8:1:1
ratio. The ensemble-averaged Boltzmann factor to insert an additional
ghost monomer on the end of an arm was then used to calculate the
incremental excess chemical potential: 4  

Monomer insertions were generally
attempted after several thousand
relaxation moves. Between 1 × 103 and 3 × 107 relaxation moves were performed for each monomer fully inserted
in the system before the polymer was appended with an additional monomer.
All simulations were repeated between 10 and 40 times to obtain reliable
statistics. At the end of the relaxation period, an additional bead
was formally inserted on the end of the arm being grown, and the process
was repeated for the next monomer on the next arm. The star polymer’s
core was similarly added via a series of test insertions.
The total chemical potential of the star polymer is given by 5  where μcoreex and μi,jex are
the incremental chemical potentials of the core and of the ith monomer of the jth arm, respectively.

Coarse-Grained Monte Carlo Simulations
A Widom insertion
scheme is used to obtain the chemical potential of a single coarse-grained
star inside these polymorphs using previously validated colloid–polymer
potentials. A star is modeled as a single soft sphere where the form
of the interparticle potential is dependent on the relative size of
the colloids and polymers, q = 2Rg/σc.36,48 The size of
a star under dilute conditions is estimated from f and Marm using previously validated
scaling on a fine lattice.34 The effective
force between a star and a colloid is determined by considering the
osmotic pressure exerted by the star on the colloid’s surface
to obtain a mean force, F(r), at
discrete interparticle separations, r, which is accurately
splined and integrated from infinitely far away to r. Again, these are purely repulsive interactions. These MC simulations
were performed at kBT = 0.155, where crystallization of the patchy colloid counterparts
in the MD simulations was observed. This coarse-grained potential
allows us to consider stars at much larger q than
in the detailed monomer MC simulations but effectively capture identical
trends.

Molecular Dynamics
Triblock patchy particles were modeled
as nearly hard-sphere particles decorated with two polar patches shaped
as truncated spherical cones. The core–core repulsion was given
by49 6  The patch–patch attraction
was provided
by a continuous version of the Kern–Frenkel model.50 It is a square-well-like attractive potential
modulated by an orientation-dependent function. Namely, the interaction
between patch i on particle α, identified by
the versor α̂i, and patch j on particle β, identified by the versor β̂j, was given by 7  where r⃗ = r⃗α – r⃗β, r = |r⃗|, r̂ = r⃗/r, and Ω is
a steep modulating function that takes
into account the orientation of a patch with respect to the versor
connecting the particles centers. It has the form of a generalized
Gaussian function: 8  Star–star interactions were modeled
through the coarse-grained potentials developed in ref (37). Using the original potential
resulted in a collapse of the open crystal into a close-packed one.
In order to overcome this limitation, we enhanced the penetration
of the crystallite by the star polymers by rescaling the potential
by a factor α = 6.5. We note that this can be realized by employing
charged star polymers. Depending on the size of the star, this enhanced
repulsion requires a few hundred elementary charges per star or, equivalently,
tens of charges per arm (cf. Supporting Information). A possible realization of this system could be provided by triblock
patchy particles fabricated by glancing angle deposition, which can
be used to produce patchy particles with diameters of down to 10 nm.51 For example, σcc = 65 nm would
require star polymers with σss ≈ 100 nm and
roughly 10 elementary charges per arm. These numbers are perfectly
compatible with experimental realizations of star polymers. We used
the same star–colloid interactions as in the Monte Carlo simulations.

We ran constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs
with the simulation package oxDNA.52 All
simulations were performed at a reduced temperature T* = kBT/ϵ = 0.155,
enforced through a modified Andersen-like thermostat,49 for at least 109 time steps of length .

During the analysis, we classified crystalline colloidal
particles
according to their local environment by using the well-known Steinhardt–Nelson
bond order parameters.38 First, following
Romano and Sciortino,16 we labeled as crystalline
all those colloids having exactly six bonded neighbors (two particles
are considered bonded if their pair interaction energy is less than
−0.1 ϵ). Then we described the local structure around
each crystalline colloid i with the quantity 9  where Nn(i) is the number of i’s
neighbors, r̂ij is the versor connecting colloid i and its jth neighbor, and Ylm is the lth degree spherical harmonic of order m. Each colloid was then assigned a locally averaged bond
order parameter of order l given by 10  where 11  where N̅n(i) is the number of colloids in
the neighborhood of i, including itself. Both q̅4 and q̅6 were able to distinguish between hexagonal and cubic local environments,
yielding equivalent results. In order to follow the annealing to the
hexagonal polymorph, we used the globally averaged bond order parameter
⟨q4⟩, defined as 12  with Nc being
the total number of crystalline colloids.
