Area-selective
atomic layer deposition (ALD) is rapidly gaining
interest because of its potential application in self-aligned fabrication
schemes for next-generation nanoelectronics. Here, we introduce an
approach for area-selective ALD that relies on the use of chemoselective
inhibitor molecules in a three-step (ABC-type) ALD cycle. A process
for area-selective ALD of SiO2 was developed comprising
acetylacetone inhibitor (step A), bis(diethylamino)silane precursor
(step B), and O2 plasma reactant (step C) pulses. Our results
show that this process allows for selective deposition of SiO2 on GeO2, SiNx, SiO2, and WO3, in the presence of Al2O3, TiO2, and HfO2 surfaces. In
situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments
and density functional theory calculations underline that the selectivity
of the approach stems from the chemoselective adsorption of the inhibitor.
The selectivity between different oxide starting surfaces and the
compatibility with plasma-assisted or ozone-based ALD are distinct
features of this approach. Furthermore, the approach offers the opportunity
of tuning the substrate-selectivity by proper selection of inhibitor
molecules.

Directing
matter to create structures
with atomic-level control of physical and chemical properties is a
long sought-after goal in nanotechnology. The deposition of atoms
at specific locations on a surface can boost advances in catalysis,1−3 energy harvesting,4 and semiconductor
device fabrication.5 Today, the semiconductor
industry is one of the main driving forces that pushes for advancing
the field of area-selective deposition.6,7 As the state-of-the-art
technology is entering the sub-10-nm scale, the conventional patterning
of thin films is becoming extremely challenging in terms of atomic-scale
precision and reliable processing. Current semiconductor manufacturing
requires many lithography and etching steps to fabricate multilayered
3D devices with perfectly aligned features.8 Especially alignment issues leading to the so-called edge placement
errors (EPEs) have become the prime bottleneck for continued downscaling.9 Therefore, innovative bottom-up techniques are required to replace or complement top-down fabrication schemes.

One of the main emerging solutions is
to implement self-aligned
fabrication schemes, in which a material is deposited on a predetermined
area in a selective manner. Area-selective deposition will reduce
the number of photolithography and etching steps and thereby enable
cost-effective options to create these structures in a bottom-up approach.
Hence, a significant effort is underway in both industry and academia
to develop robust area-selective deposition techniques.10

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) enables
layer-by-layer growth with
atomic-level thickness control. The technique relies on the cyclewise
and alternate exposure of a substrate to various vapor-phase precursors
that undergo self-limiting surface reactions, thereby allowing for
uniform and 3D-conformal film deposition.11 However, ALD typically leads to deposition on the entire surface,
and therefore the process needs to be adapted to enable area-selective
deposition.7,12−15 To date, most of the efforts
in the field of area-selective ALD include substrate patterning steps
before the area-selective ALD.12,16,17 On the other hand, in self-aligned fabrication, a partially processed
device architecture is taken as the starting point, where patterning
has been performed in a previous processing step. Thus, the sample
surface consists of several different materials, and the challenge
is to selectively deposit on the surface of only one or a subset of
these materials. The area-selective ALD processes developed so far
often concern metal-on-metal or oxide-on-oxide deposition.18−21 However, self-aligned fabrication can also require other material
combinations to be deposited in an area-selective manner. For example,
some applications might demand area-selective ALD on a specific metal
oxide in the presence of other oxide surfaces.

In this work,
an approach for area-selective ALD is introduced.
It is based on a three-step (ABC-type) ALD cycle, where step A is
the exposure of the surface to inhibitor molecules, and B and C are
the steps of a regular ALD process. Earlier investigations in chemical
vapor deposition illustrate some of the advantages of using inhibitors
for achieving area-selective deposition.22 Our approach is inspired by the work of Yanguas-Gil etal., who used inhibitor molecules (e.g., ethanol, acetone, hexane) in ABC-type ALD cycles
to improve the doping efficiency in ALD-grown materials.23 Instead of reducing the growth per cycle by
partial blocking of the adsorption sites for the precursor molecule,23 we intend to completely block precursor adsorption
on specific starting materials.

Our approach for achieving area-selective
ALD is illustrated in Figure 1. In step A, we use
an inhibitor molecule that selectively adsorbs on certain materials
on which no deposition is desired (referred to as the non-growth area).
The inhibitor blocks the precursor adsorption during the subsequent
step B. The cycle is completed in step C by removing the precursor
ligands together with the inhibitor molecules and by activating the
surface for the next cycle. This approach should ideally allow for
area-selective ALD on surfaces where the inhibitor does not adsorb
(referred to as the growth area).

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of an ideal area-selective
ALD process using
ABC-type ALD cycles with inhibitor molecules. The starting point is
a patterned surface with two different materials: the growth area
on which selective deposition is desired, and the non-growth area
on which deposition should not occur. In step A, the inhibitor molecules
selectively adsorb on the non-growth area. These inhibitor molecules
block the precursor adsorption in step B, such that precursor molecules
adsorb only on the growth area. This results in area-selective deposition
on the growth area after removal of the precursor ligands and inhibitor
molecules in step C. By repeating the cycles, material can be deposited
by ALD area-selectively. It should be noted that in reality some inhibitor
adsorption could still be allowed on the growth area, provided the
growth rate and/or material properties of the deposited film are not
significantly affected.

A pronounced benefit of this approach is that the selectivity
no
longer relies solely on the chemoselective adsorption of an ALD precursor
on a specific surface. Chemoselective adsorption is decoupled from
the precursor by inserting an inhibitor step, and this will therefore
yield more freedom for developing area-selective ALD processes. Similar
to previous work on the application of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
for area-selective ALD, this approach relies on the blocking of surface
sites for precursor adsorption. However, the main difference is that
the inhibitor molecules are reapplied every single cycle, which can
potentially lead to a more robust approach that does not suffer from
a gradual degradation of the blocking layer.13 Another advantage of reapplying the inhibitor every cycle is that
it renders area-selective deposition compatible with (or accessible
to) more types of ALD processes, including plasma-assisted or ozone-based
ALD. This will therefore extend the set of materials that can be deposited
by ALD in an area-selective manner.

In this article, we demonstrate
a proof-of-concept for using ABC-type
ALD cycles to achieve area-selective ALD of SiO2, a low-κ
material that is ubiquitous in many devices. The process consists
of acetylacetone (abbreviated in the literature as Hacac) as the inhibitor,
bis(diethylamino)silane (BDEAS) as the Si precursor, and O2 plasma as the co-reactant. In contrast to previous area-selective
ALD studies in which typically only two surfaces were considered,
the nucleation behavior of this ABC-type ALD process is investigated
here on as many as 14 different starting surfaces. As a proof-of-concept,
the process was tested on patterned Al2O3/GeO2 samples, and the selectivity was probed using surface analysis
techniques. Theoretical calculations as well as in situ studies were performed to determine the mechanistic aspects of the
chemoselective inhibitor adsorption and the precursor blocking. The
basic understanding obtained this way can be used to further improve
the selectivity of the current approach. Finally, the opportunities
enabled by this area-selective ALD approach will be discussed.

Results
and Discussion
Impact of Hacac Adsorption on SiO2 Nucleation
Saturation curves for the ABC-type ALD cycle,
included in the Supporting Information (Figure
S1), demonstrate
that the saturation behavior and the growth per cycle are not influenced
by the addition of the Hacac step. ABC-type ALD cycles of SiO2 were carried out on various starting surfaces to identify
on which surfaces deposition of SiO2 is obtained and on
which ones it is blocked. Figure 2 depicts the nucleation curves as measured by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The graph shows
that SiO2 grows without any nucleation delay on GeO2, SiO2, WO3, and SiNx. On these substrates a growth per cycle of approximately 0.09
nm/cycle was obtained. This is comparable to the growth per cycle
of the regular two-step ALD process, consisting of BDEAS precursor
and O2 plasma pulses (referred to as the BC process).24Figure 2 also shows that growth delays for ABC-type ALD of SiO2 are observed on Al2O3 (15 cycles),
TiO2, and HfO2 (both 10 cycles). The growth
delay of 15 cycles that is obtained when using the ABC-type cycles
on Al2O3 means that a SiO2 film of
∼1 nm thickness can be selectively deposited on GeO2 in the presence of Al2O3. Nucleation curves
for the BC process are shown in Figure S2, demonstrating that there is no nucleation delay for the regular
ALD process on these starting materials. Additional data for ABC-type
ALD cycles of SiO2 on Pd, Pt, Ru, ZnO, FeOx, MoOx, and CoOx starting surfaces, presented in Figure S3a, show immediate deposition on Pd, short nucleation
delays (of ∼5 cycles) on Ru, ZnO, FeOx, and Pt, and longer delays (of ∼8–12 cycles)
on MoOx and CoOx. Figure S3b depicts that the deposition
temperature also plays a role in determining the extent of the nucleation
delay, and slightly better results were obtained at 200 °C.

Figure 2 Nucleation
curves for ABC-type ALD of SiO2 on different
starting surfaces. The graphs show the thickness as a function of
the number of ALD cycles as measured by in situ SE.
We note that due to the use of an O2 plasma as the co-reactant,
the topmost layer of the starting surfaces can be oxidized during
the first few ALD cycles, which was accounted for in the SE modeling
of SiNx.

To gain insights into the inhibited deposition on Al2O3 and the immediate deposition on SiO2, SE
measurements were conducted after every individual subcycle. Figure 3a,b show the results
for a sequence of AC, ABC, and BC cycles on Al2O3 and SiO2 starting surfaces. Similar data are presented
for other starting surfaces such as TiO2, GeO2, and HfO2 in Figure S4. The
data for the AC cycles on Al2O3 in Figure 3a show a thickness
increase after each A step and a decrease after every subsequent C
step. This suggests that Hacac adsorbs on Al2O3 and can be removed by an O2 plasma pulse. The thickness
increase does not correspond directly to the thickness of the Hacac
monolayer, because its dielectric function is unknown and not taken
into account in the SE modeling. However, the thickness increase can
be considered as a measure for the amount of adsorbed material and
is therefore represented as an apparent thickness.25 Pulse C removes the adsorbed Hacac
by combustion reactions and prepares the surface for the subsequent
cycle. The thickness does not decrease completely to zero during the
first O2 plasma step, which is attributed to a slight change
of the optical response of the underlying Al2O3 film affecting the ellipsometry modeling. The middle part of Figure 3a representing the
ABC cycles indicates that after exposing the Al2O3 surface to Hacac (A), no significant amount of BDEAS adsorption
takes place (B). Conversely, when exposing the Al2O3 surface to BDEAS (B) and O2 plasma (C), as shown
at the right-hand side in the graph, there is a net thickness increase
indicating deposition of SiO2 with a growth per cycle of
∼0.09 nm/cycle.

Figure 3 Apparent thickness as measured after every reactant dosing
pulse
on (a) Al2O3 and (b) SiO2. The left-hand
part of the figure represents 3 AC cycles with Hacac (A) and O2 plasma (C) pulses, the middle part 3 ABC cycles with Hacac
(A), BDEAS precursor (B), and O2 plasma (C) pulses, and
the right-hand part 3 BC cycles with BDEAS precursor (B) and O2 plasma (C) pulses. The apparent thickness is used to reflect
that the SE modeling did not take into account the dielectric function
of the surface groups such that the thickness after step A might not
correspond to the physical thickness.25 The starting surfaces were prepared by regular ALD.

Marked differences are observed when performing
AC and ABC cycles
on a SiO2 substrate (Figure 3b). There is virtually no change in apparent thickness
during AC cycles on SiO2, which indicates that Hacac adsorbs,
at most, in minute and ineffective amounts on a SiO2 surface.
Consequently, ABC-type cycles on SiO2 result in the same
growth per cycle (∼0.09 nm/cycle) as observed for regular ALD
using BC cycles. This demonstrates that the addition of Hacac does
not significantly influence the SiO2 deposition on SiO2 starting surfaces. To conclude, Figure 3 suggests that the selectivity of the ABC-type
process stems from the chemoselective adsorption of Hacac and that
Hacac—once adsorbed—effectively blocks the precursor
adsorption.

Proof-of-Concept of Area-Selective Deposition
ABC-type
ALD of SiO2 was performed on Al2O3 and GeO2 surfaces. GeO2 was selected as a
starting surface because it shows similar behavior to SiO2; that is, the addition of an Hacac pulse to the cycle does not significantly
affect the deposition of SiO2 on this surface. Moreover,
the GeO2 surface allows for quantification of the amount
of SiO2 deposited using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). Figure S5 shows the Si 2p signals for SiO2 after 12, 15, and 21 ABC-type ALD cycles of SiO2 on both GeO2 and Al2O3 starting
surfaces. After 15 ABC-type ALD cycles the ratio of the Si 2p integrated
peak areas on Al2O3 and GeO2 is ∼0.11.
Consistent with the SE data, the integrated peak areas for the Si
2p peak confirm the blocking effect of Hacac.

The selectivity
was further investigated on a patterned Al2O3/GeO2 sample. To this end, an ALD-prepared Al2O3 layer was patterned on a GeO2 surface using
a regular lift-off method. Figure 4a–c show the TOF-SIMS elemental mapping images
for the Ge+, Al+, and Si+ secondary
ions for the patterned sample after 15 ABC-type ALD cycles of SiO2. The mappings confirm that ALD of SiO2 occurred
predominantly on the GeO2 regions. The line scans, presented
in Figure 4d, show
a high Si+ signal in the regions not covered by Al2O3, indicating area-selective deposition of SiO2 on GeO2. Only a very small amount of Si is also
present on Al2O3, which was quantified to correspond
to a 0.01 nm thick SiO2 layer, as derived from calibration
measurements (see the Methods section). Also,
lateral broadening of ∼1 nm, the so-called mushrooming
effect, is expected to take place given the nature of the
ALD technique. This will mainly impact (and be observable for) nanoscale
patterns, and the effect will be investigated on such samples in future
work.

Surface Chemistry of the ABC SiO2 ALD Process
In order to investigate the Hacac and BDEAS
adsorption on SiO2 and Al2O3 starting
surfaces, in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy
experiments were
performed on pellet-pressed SiO2 powder using a Fourier
transformed spectrometer (FTIR). To this end, the SiO2 powder
was first coated using 30 ALD cycles of SiO2 or Al2O3, respectively. FTIR spectra were collected after
coating the powder and after the subsequent Hacac and the BDEAS dosing
steps. Figure 5a shows
the results on Al2O3 as difference spectra,
using the spectrum collected after Al2O3 coating
as the reference. The results confirm that Hacac adsorbs on Al2O3, as indicated by the absorption peaks in the
wavenumber range 1300–1650 cm–1.26,27 Subsequent dosing of BDEAS precursor causes only a minor change
in the spectrum, which confirms that the preadsorbed Hacac molecules
act as inhibitors and block the impinging BDEAS molecules from chemisorbing
onto the Al2O3 surface. It is estimated that
the minor change corresponds to a fraction of ∼8% of the amount
of BDEAS molecules adsorbed on bare Al2O3. This
indicates that Hacac is not fully effective in blocking the precursor
adsorption.

Figure 5 In situ infrared absorption spectra recorded after
Hacac dosing (step A) and BDEAS precursor dosing (step B) during ABC-type
ALD of SiO2 on (a) an Al2O3-coated
substrate and (b) a SiO2-coated substrate. The graph for
Al2O3 shows the adsorption of a large amount
of Hacac and the blocking of BDEAS precursor adsorption during the
subsequent pulse. The graph for SiO2 reveals that only
a small amount of Hacac adsorbs on SiO2, which does not
significantly affect the adsorption of the BDEAS precursor. The spectra
collected after steps A and B are both referenced to the starting
surface (i.e., Al2O3 and SiO2).

A similar experiment on the SiO2-coated sample,
using
identical Hacac and BDEAS dosing times, revealed a distinctly different
behavior, as shown in Figure 5b. Now, only 8% of Hacac adsorbs on SiO2 as compared
to the amount that adsorbs on the Al2O3-coated
surface. Consequently, the adsorption of BDEAS is not significantly
affected on this surface, as shown by the large (positive) absorption
peaks. BDEAS adsorption results in positive peaks in the wavenumber
ranges 2800–3000 cm–1 and 2130–2240
cm–1, originating from the C–H and Si–H
stretching vibrations of the adsorbed BDEAS molecules.28,29 Concurrently, there is a loss of absorbance around 3740 cm–1, characteristic for the O–H stretching vibrations of the
surface hydroxyl groups that are consumed during BDEAS precursor adsorption.28,30

In conclusion, the FTIR studies confirm that Hacac selectively
adsorbs on Al2O3 and subsequently inhibits the
BDEAS adsorption. Yet, the studies also provide insights for further
improvement of the process that will be discussed below.

Mechanism Underpinning
the Chemoselective Adsorption of the
Hacac Inhibitor
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were performed to better understand the mechanism of the chemoselective
Hacac adsorption at a molecular level. Hydroxylated surfaces of α-Al2O3 (0001) and α-SiO2 (0001) were
employed to represent the experimentally used Al2O3 and SiO2 surfaces. The calculations revealed that
Hacac prefers to bind in a chelate configuration on both surfaces,
with both of its oxygen atoms bonded to Al3+/Si4+ surface sites. Alternative binding configurations were also found,
as discussed below. Concertedly, H2O is predicted to form
as a byproduct on both surfaces through a proton transfer to a hydroxyl
surface group. The H2O byproduct is expected to stick to
the surface, where it plays an important role in stabilizing the chemisorbed
acac– product through H-bond interactions (see Supporting Information, Figure S7 and the accompanying
discussion).

The structures and associated relative energies
were calculated for the stationary points along the suitable reaction
pathways (i.e., minimum energy paths)
for the adsorption of the Hacac inhibitor on Al2O3 and SiO2 (Figure 6). For the first step in Hacac binding, i.e., physisorption, two distinctive binding orientations
were identified by the DFT calculations (horizontal and vertical;
see Figure S6 and detailed description
in the Supporting Information). As evident
from Figure 6a, the
dissociative binding of Hacac on Al2O3 is associated
with an overall exothermic reaction with an energy gain of 0.49 eV.
The chemisorption involves the formation of an intermediate complex
through a slightly exothermic (ΔE = −0.07 eV) process with near-zero barrier (Ea ≈ 0.01 eV). The intermediate complex comprises
Hacac that is bonded to the Al3+ site through one of its
oxygen atoms (Figure S7a). This intermediate
species is predicted to lose its hydroxyl proton through a kinetically
accessible process (Ea = 0.25 eV), producing
a monodentate adduct (type A, Figure S7b) alongside H2O. However, this adduct corresponds to a
transition-state species on the energetically downhill path that yields
the chelate end-product (type B, Figure S7c) through binding of acac– via its
second oxygen to the same surface Al3+ site. Considering
that the Hacac would have already gained sufficient kinetic energy
by physisorbing on the Al2O3 surface (i.e., ΔEp = −0.75 eV, physisorption energy), it would readily overcome
the overall barrier of 0.25 eV and be converted to the chelate (type
B) end-product. Therefore, none of the monodentate (type A) species
(intermediate or adduct) are expected to accumulate on the Al2O3 surface.

paths for the Hacac adsorption
on (a) Al2O3 and (b) SiO2 surfaces,
as described by the corresponding chemical equations. Minimum energy
structures of the important steps are also shown (yellow, green, and
blue dots and corresponding insets), where some oxygen and hydrogen
atoms are hidden for clarity. First points of the energy profiles
correspond to the Hacac species physisorbed on each surface and have
ΔEp = −0.75
and −0.37 eV with respect to the separated Hacac gas phase
and Al2O3/SiO2 surfaces. These are
taken as reference points (0 eV) to calculate the activation and final-state
energies. Color code for atoms: silicon, pink; aluminum, light gray;
hydrogen, white; oxygen, red; carbon, gray.

Similar to the Al2O3 case, a chelate
(type
B, Figure S7d) species is the end-product
of Hacac adsorption on SiO2, whereas the monodentate (type
A) complex is only a transition state (Figure 6b). More importantly, the overall chemisorption
reaction on SiO2 is calculated to be endothermic and to
require an energy of 0.98 eV, accompanied by an extremely high kinetic
barrier (Ea = 2.35 eV). In accordance
with the SE and FTIR results, these DFT findings suggest that Hacac
binds readily on hydroxylated Al2O3, while the
overall reaction on hydroxylated SiO2 is both thermodynamically
and kinetically hindered. This explains the selectivity of Hacac adsorption
on Al2O3 as opposed to SiO2 during
the ABC-type ALD of SiO2.

Role of Surface Acidity
on Hacac Adsorption
The chemoselective
adsorption of Hacac on various starting surfaces can also be interpreted
in terms of surface acidity.31 This allows
explaining the results obtained on the experimentally used starting
surfaces. Hacac has a pKa value of 9.0
in aqueous solution at 25 °C, and therefore it should behave
as a weak acid.32 A reaction with Hacac
is not likely to occur with the hydroxyl groups that possess an acidic
character (e.g., SiO2).33 Conversely, hydroxyl groups with
more basic character can react with Hacac. In this framework, an acid/base
surface reaction between Hacac and the surface hydroxyl groups of
a given oxide (e.g., Al2O3) can be written as 1  where M is a generic atom
of the oxide (either metal or nonmetal) and the asterisks represent
the surface species. A generalization can be made in order to explain
which surfaces allow for the chemoselective adsorption of the Hacac
inhibitor (and potential blocking of the precursor) and which surfaces
will lead to immediate deposition instead. The acidity of an oxide
can be predicted from the electronegativity of the cation element,
M.34 The relative acidity of several oxide
surfaces was calculated using Sanderson’s electronegativity
scale and the electronegativity equalization principle, in order to
explain the data of Figures 2 and S3, as presented in Figure S8. The agreement of the calculated values
with the experimental data underlines that the distinct acidic/basic
behavior of different oxide compounds governs the chemoselective adsorption
of Hacac. Therefore, this provides a framework for predicting the
area selectivity on different starting surfaces.

Merits and
Opportunities Provided by the Approach
The
approach introduced in this article shows similarities with recent
work by Engstrom and co-workers in which inhibitor molecules are co-injected
into the reactor together with the precursor.35 Also that approach relies on influencing the precursor adsorption
by an inhibitor molecule. The benefit of dividing the inhibitor and
precursor exposure over two different dosing steps is that the adsorption
of both molecules can reach saturation independently, without suffering
from competitive adsorption effects. Consequently, similar to regular
two-step ALD processes, an ABC-type ALD process should allow for the
deposition of conformal films on nanostructured surfaces.

A
more natural approach for achieving area-selective ALD would be to
design dedicated ALD precursors to enable chemoselective adsorption
on materials on which deposition should occur. However, in practice
this is extremely challenging because the precursor molecule has to
contain the atom to be deposited, while also satisfying other requirements
to behave as an effective ALD precursor (in terms of stability, volatility,
and self-limiting adsorption). By using two different molecules in
an ABC-type ALD cycle, the inhibitor provides the selectivity in step
A, without compromising the properties of the precursor dosed in step
B.

When the ABC-type ALD approach is compared to other area-selective
ALD approaches, several distinctive aspects can be identified. As
discussed in the introduction, reapplying the inhibitor molecules
every cycle can be beneficial from a reliability point-of-view, while
it also makes the approach compatible with plasma-assisted or ozone-based
ALD. Moreover, an important merit of this approach is that it distinguishes
between the growth on different oxide surfaces (e.g., GeO2/SiO2versus Al2O3/HfO2/TiO2).

The FTIR studies revealed that the selectivity of the Hacac adsorption
is not perfect, since some adsorption was also observed on SiO2. However, the amount of Hacac on SiO2 is sufficiently
small such that it does not influence the deposition on the growth
area, as we concluded from the in situ SE measurements
(Figures 2 and S1). Moreover, a small amount of BDEAS adsorption
was detectable on Al2O3 after dosing the Hacac
inhibitor. Ex situ XPS and TOF-SIMS also confirmed
that a minor amount of SiO2 was deposited on Al2O3 after 15 cycles, suggesting that the adsorbed Hacac
does not completely block the precursor adsorption. This incomplete
precursor blocking can occur most likely due to the presence of (i)
surface defects or impurities that can negatively influence the ideal
inhibitor adsorption behavior; (ii) surface reactive sites that remain
accessible to the precursor; and (iii) physisorbed water molecules
on the surface that can compete with the Hacac chemisorption, as discussed
in the DFT calculations in the Supporting Information, Figure S7. This implies that the selectivity
of the ABC-type ALD process can be further improved by exploring different
surface preparation procedures and by optimizing the deposition conditions.
In addition, alternative inhibitors, different inhibitor dosing strategies,
or co-dosing two or more inhibitor molecules can be considered for
improving the selectivity. All these parameters offer physicochemical
pathways to enhance the inhibitor surface coverage and, therefore,
maximize the blocking effect during the precursor dose step. For these
reasons, we foresee that it should be possible to significantly improve
the selectivity to the extent it meets the requirements of semiconductor
manufacturing.

The ABC approach provides the opportunity of
tailoring the substrate-selectivity
of an ALD process by selection of the chemoselective inhibitor molecule.
There is a wealth of information in surface science and catalysis
literature about the adsorption of organic molecules on inorganic
surfaces,36,37 which can serve as a good starting point
for selecting suitable inhibitor molecules.23 The ideal case would be to use an inhibitor molecule that adsorbs
on all surfaces, except for the particular surface on which deposition
is needed. Additional research is required to investigate whether
such selectivity is achievable and to further explore the toolbox
of using inhibitor molecules for area-selective ALD. We expect that
this approach can enable area-selective ALD for different materials
by using other precursors and for example H2 or NH3 plasma co-reactants. To this end, the interaction of the
inhibitor with the material to be deposited and with the plasma needs
to be studied. In view of the large set of possibilities, this will
be the subject of a follow-up study.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated the use of chemoselective inhibitors in ABC-type
ALD cycles as a route for area-selective ALD. Area-selective ALD of
SiO2 was achieved using a process consisting of alternated
Hacac inhibitor, BDEAS precursor, and O2 plasma pulses
on a GeO2 substrate with patterned Al2O3 features. SiO2 is an extremely relevant and widely
employed low-κ material, for which no area-selective ALD process
is available. In situ SE studies revealed that area-selective
(i.e., noninhibited) growth can
also be obtained on WOx, SiO2, SiNx, and Pd, while there are nucleation
delays of 10–15 cycles on TiO2, HfO2,
CoOx, and MoOx. The selectivity originates from the chemoselective adsorption of
the Hacac inhibitor molecule. This was corroborated in detail by in situ SE and FTIR experiments, as well as by DFT calculations,
and generalized by correlating the Hacac adsorption to the acidity
of the starting surface. SE and FTIR experiments confirmed that adsorbed
Hacac blocks the subsequent BDEAS precursor adsorption, thereby resulting
in area-selective deposition of SiO2 on those surfaces
on which Hacac does not adsorb.

The presented results establish
a proof-of-concept for the introduced
approach and provide insight into how the selectivity can be further
improved. The SiO2 ABC-type process offers an exceptional
substrate-selectivity, by distinguishing between different oxide starting
surfaces. We expect that the compatibility of the approach with ozone-based
or plasma-assisted ALD, as well as the ability to tune the substrate-selectivity
by selection of the inhibitor molecule, will extend the portfolio
of materials that can be deposited by ALD in an area-selective manner.

Methods
ALD Processes
The depositions were carried out in an
Oxford Instruments FlexAL reactor, which is described in detail in
ref (38). In short,
it is a vacuum vessel equipped with a remote inductively coupled plasma
(ICP) source, a 200 mm substrate table, a turbo-molecular pump, and
a loadlock. The SiO2 plasma-assisted ALD recipe with BDEAS
(H2Si[N(C2H5)2]2) precursor (also known as SAM.24) and O2 plasma pulses,
characterized by Dingemans etal.,24 was used as the starting point. The
recipe was changed to an ABC-type ALD process by adding a step of
Hacac dosing before the precursor step. The Hacac (≥99% ReagentPlus;
CAS 123-54-6) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and it was employed
without further purification. The Hacac has a vapor pressure of 6
Torr at 25 °C, and it exists in two tautomeric forms: keto and
enol. In gas phase, the tautomeric equilibrium is shifted toward the
enol form,39 which was the form considered
in the DFT calculations. The Hacac inhibitor was kept at room temperature
in a stainless steel container and vapor drawn into the chamber using
3 pulses of 5 s each. All experiments were carried out at a substrate
temperature of 150 °C.

Substrate Preparation Methods
A
set of 14 different
materials was investigated as starting surfaces in this study. Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, WOx, CoOx, MoOx, FeOx, ZnO, Pt, Pd,
Ru, and SiNx samples were prepared by
ALD in our lab using standard ALD recipes. In addition, crystalline
Si and Ge substrates were used. All these substrates were cleaned
by 5 min O2 plasma exposure (8 mTorr O2, 200
W) prior to the deposition, with the exception of SiNx. Because of this O2 plasma cleaning step,
the Si and Ge substrates are referred to as SiO2 and GeO2, respectively, in this article.

Analytical Methods
In situ SE was
performed using a J.A. Woollam M2000D ellipsometer as the main diagnostic
technique to characterize the process and to measure the nucleation
curves, using a Cauchy parametrization to model the data. In the case
of SiNx, O2 plasma oxidation
occurs during the SiO2 deposition, which was taken into
account in the modeling of the data of Figure 2. The nucleation delay was defined as the
number of cycles until the first data point that showed a measurable
increase in thickness. The dielectric function of a monolayer of adsorbed
Hacac molecules was not taken into account, and the same Cauchy parametrization
as used to describe the deposited SiO2 was employed to
model the subcycle SE data of Figures 3 and S4. In these results,
the thickness obtained from modeling the data after Hacac exposure
is therefore represented as an “apparent thickness”.

XPS measurements were performed using a K-Alpha system from Thermo
Scientific. TOF-SIMS analysis was performed at Philips Innovation
Laboratories using an Ion-Tof TOF-SIMS IV instrument, which was operated
in positive mode to measure Al+ (m/z = 27), Si+ (m/z = 28), and Ge+ (sum of m/z = 70, 72 representing the most abundant isotopes of Ge). In addition,
TOF-SIMS mapping was performed on patterned GeO2/Al2O3 samples by applying burst-alignment with long
pulses of 200 ns, resulting in high lateral resolution (∼0.3
μm), but low mass resolution (∼1 m/z). A series of 2, 5, and 10 regular ALD cycles for SiO2 deposition was performed on Ge substrates to calibrate the
TOF-SIMS signals for thickness quantification. These samples were
probed using the high-current bunched mode, which allows for measurement
with high mass resolution. Note that the thickness of the deposited
SiO2 on the GeO2 regions is already beyond the
linearity limit of TOF-SIMS, meaning that the ratio of the Si+ intensity of the GeO2 and Al2O3 regions in the line scans underestimates the selectivity.

In situ FTIR experiments were carried out in a
home-built ALD setup, which is very similar to the FlexAL reactor
in terms of the plasma source and pumping system. This home-built
setup is equipped with a Bruker Vector FTIR spectrometer with a mid-infrared
light source (Globar ∼10 000–50 cm–1) and a liquid N2 cooled mercury cadmium tellurium detector
with a spectral range of 12 000–550 cm–1, a translational and rotational sample manipulator, and KBr windows
that can be isolated from the chamber with gate valves. FTIR measurements
were performed on Aerosil OX50 SiO2 powder that was pellet-pressed
on a tungsten mesh. The powder was heated to 150 °C by passing
a current through the mesh. To account for the accessible surface
area of the powder, the spectra were normalized to the peak intensities
of regular saturated TMA or BDEAS adsorption on the same sample before
the Hacac dosing.

Computational Methods
All electronic
structure calculations
were performed using the projector-augmented wave function40,41 as implemented in Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package
(VASP v.5.3.5).42−44 First-principles calculations were carried out using
the generalized gradient approximation to the DFT.45,46 Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation
functionals47 were employed, and the van
der Waals interactions were also accounted for on an empirical basis
(PBE-D3).48 Hydroxylated α-Al2O3 and α-SiO2 clusters were used
as approximations of the amorphous hydroxylated Al2O3 and SiO2 used in the experiments. Additional computational
details including the model system preparation can be found in the Supporting Information and also elsewhere.17,49
