Force spectroscopy is enhancing our
understanding of single-biomolecule,
single-cell, and nanoscale mechanics. Force spectroscopy postulates
the proportionality between the interaction force and the instantaneous
probe deflection. By studying the probe dynamics, we demonstrate that
the total force acting on the probe has three different components:
the interaction, the hydrodynamic, and the inertial. The amplitudes
of those components depend on the ratio between the resonant frequency
and the frequency at which the data are measured. A force–distance
curve provides a faithful measurement of the interaction force between
two molecules when the inertial and hydrodynamic components are negligible.
Otherwise, force spectroscopy measurements will underestimate the
value of unbinding forces. Neglecting the above force components requires
the use of frequency ratios in the 50–500 range. These ratios
will limit the use of high-speed methods in force spectroscopy. The
theory is supported by numerical simulations.

Force spectroscopy
methods are
expanding our understanding of the mechanics of biomolecules, cells,
polymers, and hybrid materials as well as the interactions between
different biomolecules and/or materials. The measurement of a variety
of ligand–receptor interactions1−3 and protein unfolding
processes4 represented key landmarks in
the understanding of how single biomolecules respond to external forces.
The capability to map mechanical properties with nanoscale spatial
resolution of a large variety of surfaces that range from cells to
semiconductors represents another major achievement of force spectroscopy.5−7 Nanoscale force spectroscopy measurements are revealing the changes
at both the single cell and extra cellular matrix level that accompany
the evolution of several diseases.8−10

High-speed atomic
force microscopy (AFM) has been developed to
generate AFM images at video rate.11−13 An analogous high-speed
method has been developed to record force–distance curves.14 These approaches are based on the miniaturization
of the cantilever and the piezoelectric elements that produce the xyz displacements. The miniaturization enables increasing
the fundamental resonances of the different mechanical elements, which,
in turn, suppress the coupling between the above resonances and the
frequencies of the moving elements.12

Force spectroscopy is based on the acquisition of force–distance
curves (force curves) with an AFM setup (see Figure 1). The tip functionalization method, the
biomolecules, or the type of distance modulation used in the experimental
setup has led to different force spectroscopy approaches. The most
common are single-molecule force spectroscopy,3,15 single-cell
force spectroscopy,16 force volume,5 or peak force tapping.17 The first two approaches are applied to study biomolecular or cell
adhesion processes at the single-biomolecule level. The other two
methods are applied to study the nanomechanical response of cells,
polymers, and organic and inorganic interfaces. The latter approaches
will be called nanoscale force spectroscopy. From the dynamics of
the cantilever-tip system, the above approaches are equivalent because
they are described by the same equation of motion.

tip deflection for an interaction force model that considers that
adhesion forces are present only once the tip has reached mechanical
contact with the sample. Δt1 is
the time interval in the out-of-contact regions (approaching and retracting
from the sample). Δt2 (approaching)
and Δt4 (retraction) are the time
intervals suitable for Young’s modulus measurements. Δt3 is the time interval suitable for establishing
a feedback loop on the peak force. Δt5 is the time interval suitable for unbinding force measurements.
The inset shows a sinusoidal tip distance modulation in a force spectroscopy
experiment. (c) Force model used to generate the data of (b). The
hysteresis in the adhesion force produces the mismatch between the
force curve obtained during the approach and retracting sections of
the cycle.

We note that a complete theory
of single-molecule, single-cell,
or nanoscale force spectroscopies involves two independent theoretical
elements. First, there is the dynamics of the cantilever-tip system
that supports the relationship between the measured force–distance
curve and the interaction force between the molecules of interest.
The other element is the theory that enables transforming the features
measured in a force–distance curve into either unbinding forces
or energies (Bell–Evans model)18−20 or into Young’s
modulus maps of the sample (contact mechanics models).5,6 The second element has been the subject of intense scientific activity,
while the first element, to our best knowledge, has never been addressed.
The development of high-speed AFM methods12−14,21−23 motivates the relevance and interest
of the theory of the cantilever-tip dynamics in force spectroscopy.

Single-molecule (cell) and nanoscale force spectroscopies postulate
the existence of a linear relationship between the interaction force
and the cantilever deflection. Here we present the theory of the dynamics
of the cantilever-tip system in force spectroscopy. The theory shows
the cantilever deflection bears contributions from three different
sources: the tip–sample interaction, the hydrodynamic force,
and the inertial force. We show that the recorded force–distance
curve provides a faithful measurement of the interaction force acting
between the tip and the sample when the hydrodynamic and inertial
force components are negligible. The proportionality between the cantilever
deflection and the interaction force depends on the frequency ratio
between the resonant frequency of the cantilever and the frequency
at which the distance is modulated. We study the effect of the frequency
ratio on three different parameters: the peak-force value for feedback
purposes, the stiffness or Young’s modulus values, and unbinding
forces. The effect of the frequency ratio is more dramatic on the
unbinding force than on the other two parameters. A frequency ratio
in the 10–50 range is suitable to perform imaging with a feedback
loop in the peak force value. A ratio above 50 is needed to get reliable
values of the sample stiffness, while the measurement of unbinding
forces with a relative error below 5% requires a ϖ = 300. The
use of high ratios would make it hard to combine force spectroscopy
with current high-speed AFM operation. Numerical simulations confirm
the validity of the theory.

Results and Discussion
Theoretical Model
The theory and considerations reported
here apply to all quasistatic force spectroscopy methods such as single-molecule
force spectroscopy, single-cell force spectroscopy, force volume,
or peak force tapping. These methods are different in terms of the
tip functionalization chemistry, tip size, feedback loop, or the type
of tip–sample periodic displacement (triangular, trapezoidal
or sinusoidal). However, the above factors do not affect the overall
dynamics of the tip–sample system.

The theoretical model
is developed for a sinusoidal displacement. The use of sinusoidal
waves simplifies the mathematical treatment and the interpretation
of the measured material properties because they have a single Fourier
component. We have simulated the tip–sample displacement by
using both sinusoidal and triangular waves. The simulations show that
both types of displacements produce the same phenomenology (see below).
The conclusions derived in this section are general. They apply for
trapezoidal or triangular displacements. In fact, one the latest nanoscale
force spectroscopy methods uses sinusoidal displacements.17

In force spectroscopy, the instantaneous
tip–surface interaction
force Fts is postulated as 1  where k is the static
force
constant and z(t) is the instantaneous
cantilever-tip’s deflection. However, neither the above hypothesis
nor its applicability range has ever been demonstrated.

In a
force spectroscopy experiment the distance between the tip
and the sample surface is periodically modulated while the cantilever
deflection is measured. This distance modulation is different from
the situation in tapping mode AFM. There, the cantilever is directly
excited at or near its resonant frequency and the feedback modulates
the piezo z to keep the amplitude at a constant value.24

The main control elements of a force spectroscopy
experiment operated
with a feedback in the maximum value of the force exerted on the sample
(peak force) are depicted in Figure 2. The topography feedback processes the instantaneous
force and controls the mean cantilever–sample distance to reach
a maximum value of the force exerted on the sample. The tip–sample
surface separation is modulated by introducing a sinusoidal displacement
in the sample support base with respect to the cantilever base (Figure 1a) or vice
versa (Figure 1b).

Figure 2 Block diagrams and distances in a force spectroscopy experiment.
The tip–sample separation is modulated by a sinusoidal wave.
(a) The distance is modulated by moving the sample support with a
frequency fm. (b) The distance is modulated
by moving the cantilever base with a frequency fm. In both cases ωm = 2πfm. PID stands for proportional-integral-derivative controller;
FDC stands for force–distance curve.

Let us start by proposing the equation of motion when the
modulation
of the distance is applied to the sample support base. In this case,
the tip displacement is given by the projection of the Euler–Bernoulli
beam equation at x = L where L is
the cantilever length,25 2  where m is the effective
cantilever mass, Q the quality factor (fundamental
mode), and ω0 the natural angular resonant frequency
(fundamental mode). The instantaneous tip–surface distance D(t) is given by 3  where zc, Am, and ωm are respectively
the probe height, the amplitude, and the angular frequency at which
the distance is modulated. The sample surface is chosen as the origin
for the distance. The cantilever deflection z(t) is measured with respect to its rest (undeflected) position.

The key point expressed in eq 2 is that in a force spectroscopy experiment, the interaction
force Fts has three different force contributions:
cantilever restoring, inertia, and hydrodynamic. To emphasize the
frequency-dependent character of the z deflection,
we introduce a normalized time variable τ: 4  Then eq 2 becomes 5  with 6  Equation 5 expresses the tip motion
in terms of the frequency ratio
ϖ. If distances and forces are expressed in the MKS unit system,
we can estimate the relevance of the different terms in the second
right-hand side of eq 5. Force constant values of common AFM cantilevers are in the 0.01
to 100 N/m range; Q values are in the 1 (liquid)
to 500 (air) range. For k = 1 N/m, Q = 100, and ϖ = 100, the prefactors in eq 5 (N/m) for the inertial, hydrodynamic, and
restoring terms are respectively 10–4, 10–2, and 1. We deduce that for ϖ ≫ 1 the inertial and hydrodynamic
terms are negligible with respect to the restoring force of the cantilever;
then the instantaneous force is well approximated by the restoring
force 7  Let us now deduce the equation when the modulation
of the distance is applied to the cantilever base. In this case, the
inertial and hydrodynamic terms depend explicitly on the distance,
while the restoring force depends on the cantilever deflection: 8   9  By introducing the normalized
time τ
and expressing s in terms of z(t), eq 8 becomes 10  To obtain an asymptotic expression (ϖ
≫ 1) is less obvious than before because of the dependence
of the value Am could be a few hundreds
of nm. In general, for high-frequency ratios eq 10 leads to 11  

Comparison
between Theory and Numerical Simulations
To determine quantitatively
the validity of eq 1 to
recover the tip–sample interaction
force from force–distance curves, we have performed a numerical
simulation analysis. The use of numerical simulations is firmly established
in dynamic AFM.24,26−31 First, we introduce a tip–surface force model Fts; then we solve numerically the nonapproximated equation
of motion, respectively, eq 5 and eq 10,
to determine z(τ). Finally, the force is reconstructed
by using eq 1, and it
is compared with the interaction force provided by the model. We have
used different models for the tip–surface force such as Hertz
and Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov with the inclusion of a
van der Waals attraction force. These models and their parameters
are fully described in the dynamic AFM simulations code dForce.31 We have also simulated the presence of unbinding
forces of the ligand–receptor type (see below).

Figure 3 shows a comparison
between the interaction force (model) and the force reconstructed
by using eq 1 for ϖ
ratios of 5, 10, 20, and 100. Figure 3a corresponds to a cantilever with a Q = 100 (air), while Figure 3b describes a cantilever with Q = 1 (liquid).
In the simulations, we have used the following parameters: Eeff = 1 GPa, H = 0.5 eV (air)
and H = 0 eV (liquid), f0 = 150 kHz, k = 5 N/m, Am = 15 nm, zc = 10 nm. In all cases Etip = 170 GPa and tip radius R = 5 nm.

Figure 3 Dependence of the time-varying force reconstructed by using eq 1 on the frequency at which
the distance is modulated for air (Q = 100) and liquid
(Q = 1). (a) The sample support is displaced at ϖ
= 5, 10, 20 (Q = 100). (b) The sample support is
displaced at ϖ = 100 (Q = 100). The dashed
line shows the model force. (c) The sample support is displaced at
ϖ = 5, 10, 20 (Q = 1). (d) The sample support
is displaced at ϖ = 100 (Q = 1). The dashed
line shows the interaction force (model). The insets show the force
in the vicinity of the snap-off region. Simulation parameters: a0 = 0.2 nm Eeff =
1 GPa, H = 0.5 eV, f0 = 150 kHz, k = 5 N/m, Q = 100, R = 5 nm, Am = 15 nm, zc = 10 nm.

For ϖ = 5 the force reconstructed by using eq 1 oscillates at the actual
resonant
frequency. The oscillatory behavior comes from the hydrodynamic and
inertial terms components of the force. These components give rise
to a transient oscillatory behavior. The simulation shows that for
relatively small frequency ratios (1–10) the transient component
dominates the cantilever deflection. A noticeable ringing is observed
in the out-of-contact region. The amplitude of the ringing is about
50% of the peak force value (∼12 nN). The value of the transient
term is reduced by increasing the ratio. At ϖ = 20 the amplitude
of the ringing in the out-of-contact region amounts to about 25% of
the peak force value. The transient term has a dramatic effect in
the measurement of the adhesion force. At ϖ = 100, the measured
peak and the maximum of the force (model) coincide (Figure 3b). However, the inset shows
that the ringing introduces an error in the determination of the adhesion
force. We note that the accuracy gained by increasing the frequency
ratio comes at the expense of decreasing the imaging speed.

In liquid the ringing in the oscillation associated with the inertial
and hydrodynamic terms is attenuated by the low value of the quality
factor (Figure 3c and
d). In other words, after a few oscillations the cantilever reaches
the stationary state. For ϖ = 100 the interaction force (model)
shows a good agreement with the time-varying force reconstructed by
using eq 1.

A similar
trend is obtained when the distance modulation acts on
the cantilever base (see Figure S1 in the SI). The simulations show that a sample-based modulation provides a
slightly better configuration to achieve the proportionality between
cantilever deflection and interaction force in liquid. This is also
in agreement with a comparison between the asymptotic limits given
by eq 5 and eq 11. However, the numerical
differences are very minor. In practice both methods are equivalent
to perform a force spectroscopy experiment.

Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy:
Unbinding Force Measurements
It is well established that
the unbinding force in single-molecule
force spectroscopy depends on the speed at which the tip is retracted
from the surface.15,19,32 The loading rate dependence on the unbinding force incorporates
the influence of the thermal energy to overcome the energy barrier
of the bond. Here we demonstrate that the apparent value of the unbinding
force measured in force spectroscopy also depends on the cantilever
dynamics. The hydrodynamic and inertial terms also contribute to the
cantilever deflection (eq 5 or eq 11). These terms
depend on the frequency ratio between the resonant frequency of the
cantilever and the frequency at which the distance is modulated.

To simulate the force measured in a single-molecule force spectroscopy
experiment, we have used an interaction force model with the following
expression: 12  with Funb = 50
pN, β = 0.8 nm–1, D0 = 10 nm, a0 = 0.4 nm, and Eeff = 1 MPa. This model simulates a generic unbinding
force experiment with a rupture value of −50 pN. The ligand
is attached to the AFM tip by a flexible linker with a total length
of 10 nm. In the simulation, the tip parameters are k = 0.7 N/m, f0 = 150 kHz, Q = 1, R = 5 nm, and Etip = 170 GPa.

Figure 4a shows
the time-varying force in the presence of an unbinding event for different
modulation frequencies. The profiles indicate that the measured rupture
force, minimum in the time-varying force profiles, depends on the
modulation frequency. By reducing the modulation frequency (that is,
by increasing ϖ), the value of the measured unbinding force
increases toward the real value. This effect becomes more noticeable
by comparing directly the reconstructed force for two different frequency
ratios, ϖ = 5 and 300, with respect to the force model (Figure 4b). For ϖ =
5 the measured unbinding force is −20 pN, that is, 2.5 times
smaller in absolute value than the unbinding force of the model (−50
pN). On the other hand, when the modulation frequency is 300 times
smaller than the resonant frequency, the unbinding force is −48
pN, that is, 2 pN smaller than the unbinding force of the model.

force spectroscopy simulations. Time-varying
forces for different distance modulation frequencies in a liquid.
(b) Force curve reconstructed by using eq 1 for fm = 30 kHz
(ϖ = 5) and fm = 0.5 kHz (ϖ
= 300) and force curve of the model. (c) Dependence of the unbinding
and peak forces on the frequency ratio for f0 = 150 kHz. Parameters of the interaction force and cantilever
dynamics: Funb = 50 pN, β = 0.8
nm–1, D0 = 10 nm, a0 = 0.4 nm, Eeff = 1 MPa, k = 0.7 N/m, Q = 1, R = 5 nm, Am = 15 nm, zc = 10 nm.

Figure 4c
shows
the unbinding and peak forces as a function of the frequency ratio
from 1 to 600. The measured peak force rapidly converges to its value
of 37 pN. This happens for a frequency ratio of ϖ = 10. This
is in contrast with the behavior of the unbinding force. The unbinding
force (absolute value) increases rapidly in the 1 to 200 range. From
there it slowly converges to the value of the rupture force (model).
To perform the measurements with a relative error below 10% requires
a ϖ > 100. A measurement with a relative error below 5% requires
a ϖ = 300. These frequency ratios will greatly limit the capability
to incorporate high-speed methods into single-molecule force spectroscopy.
An estimation of the dependence of the relative error on the frequency
ratio could be deduced from the data shown in Figure 4c.

The data shown in Figure 4 have been obtained by using
a tip–sample periodic
displacement described by a sinusoidal wave. Similar results have
been obtained by using triangular waves (see Figure S2 in the SI).

Nanoscale Force Spectroscopy
Nanoscale
force spectroscopy,
sometimes referred to as multiparametric imaging,3 provides high-resolution images and quantitative mechanical
maps of a large variety of materials from cells,33 to proteins,34,35 to polymers.36−40 A distinctive feature of nanoscale force spectroscopy methods with
respect to other nanomechanical spectroscopies such as force modulation,41 pulsed force AFM,42 torsional harmonics,43,44 bimodal,45,46 and other multifrequency AFM methods47,48 is that in
nanoscale force spectroscopy the force is assumed to be proportional
to the cantilever deflection. This hypothesis greatly simplifies the
interpretation and processing of the experimental data. However, we
have shown for single-molecule force spectroscopy that fulfilling
the proportionality hypothesis imposes strong requirements in terms
of the frequency ratio.

We have performed several simulations
to illustrate the transformation of the force versus time curves into force–distance curves, as well as the capability
to reconstruct the force for a variety of materials. We simulate the
force curves of a very soft material of 1 kPa in liquid Q = 1 (simulations for imaging a living cell) and a very stiff material
of 100 GPa in air (Q = 100). In both cases we have
used a frequency ratio of ϖ = 100 and a distance modulation
applied on the sample support.

Figure 5a,b shows
the force curves for the very soft material (1 kPa). In this case
the peak force value is close to the sensitivity limit of the instrument
(25 pN). The agreement obtained between the interaction force (model)
and the force reconstructed by using eq 1 is very satisfactory. The relative numerical difference
is always below 1%. A similar agreement is obtained for a material
8 orders of magnitude stiffer (Figure 5c,d). The main difference is that the peak force in
this case is about 4 orders of magnitude higher. In the first case
(cells) the ringing is not observed because of the low value of the Q factor and the ratio used ϖ = 50. In the second
case, the ringing is not observed because the adhesion force is 1
nN, that is, about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the peak force
value.

The dashed line shows the model. Simulation parameters: H = 0.0 eV, η = 0.1 Pa s, f0 = 18
kHz, fm = 0.36 kHz, k = 0.06 N/m, Q = 1, R = 5 nm, Am = 500 nm, zc =
10 nm. (c) Time-varying force for a very stiff sample (Eeff = 100 GPa). (d) Force versus distance

Simulation parameters: H = 0.3 eV, a0 = 0.2 nm, f0 = 525 kHz, fm = 10.5 kHz, k = 40 N/m, Q = 100, R = 5 nm, Am = 15 nm, zc = 10 nm. (e) Model
and reconstructed Young’s modulus map spanning the whole range
of solid materials. We have used the specifications of the following
available commercial cantilevers (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA, USA):
C1: MLCT, C2: SCANASYST–LIQ, C3: SCANASYST–AIR, C4:
RTESPA–150, C5: RTESP 525. Simulation parameters specified
in parentheses (f0 (kHz), fm (kHz), k (N/m), Am (nm)).

Next we studied the capability
of nanoscale force spectroscopy
to reconstruct the Young’s modulus of a wide range of materials
from 1 kPa (living cells) to 100 GPa (steel). Figure 5e shows in a logarithmic scale the comparison
obtained between the model and the reconstructed Young’s modulus
values. The comparison has been performed by using the most suitable
cantilever for each Young’s modulus range. We have used force
constant and resonant frequency values from available commercial cantilevers.
The agreement is quite satisfactory. Optimum frequency ratios will
enable measuring the Young’s modulus over a 109 range,
which, in practice, includes all existing solid surfaces.

A
more detailed estimation of the theoretical uncertainty is given
by calculating the relative error (see Figure S3 in the SI).

Material Property and Frequency Ratio
The above results
show that the effect of inertial and hydrodynamic force components
on the cantilever deflection affects more the measurement of the unbinding
force than the determination of the peak force or the Young’s
modulus. This asymmetry arises from the temporal separation that exists
between the measurement of those observables, within the period of
the modulation signal, and the instant the snap-off of the cantilever
from the surface occurs. The hydrodynamic and inertial terms are excited
during the snap-off. From then, these terms decay as Q/f0. Figure 4b shows the measurement of the unbinding
force by using eq 1.
The temporal interval of the measurement Δt5 coincides with the snap-off process (Figure 1b). On the other hand, the
Young’s modulus is measured at either Δt2 or Δt4, and the peak
force is measured at Δt3. These
time intervals are far from the influence of the snap-off process.
On the basis of the above results, we propose the following rules
for quasistatic force microscopy methods. Topography imaging with
a feedback on a peak force value could be achieved with high accuracy
by using a frequency ratio of ϖ = 10. Young’s modulus
measurements require a ratio of ϖ = 50. Unbinding and adhesion
forces are very sensitive to the hydrodynamic and inertial terms.
Their determination with a relative error less than 5% requires the
use of a high frequency ratio, ϖ > 300. This asymmetry has
been
observed experimentally.49

Conclusion
We have developed the theory of the cantilever-tip dynamics as
it applies to single-molecule, single-cell, and nanoscale force spectroscopies.
These methods postulate that the time-varying tip–sample force
is proportional to the instantaneous deflection of the cantilever.
The theory shows the cantilever deflection bears contributions from
three different sources: the tip–sample, the hydrodynamic,
and the inertial forces. We show that a recorded force–distance
curve provides a faithful measurement of the interaction force acting
between the tip and the sample when the hydrodynamic and inertial
force components are negligible. To meet this condition requires the
use of data acquisition rates that are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude
smaller than the fundamental frequency of the cantilever. We also
demonstrate that the influence of these terms depends on the property
to be measured. The above asymmetry has its origin in the transient
character of the hydrodynamic and inertial terms and the time interval
of the modulation period where they are excited. In particular, the
hydrodynamic and the inertial forces tend to reduce the value of the
unbinding force. To measure unbinding or adhesion forces with a good
accuracy might require the use of frequency ratios above 300. For
the determination of nanomechanical properties such as the Young’s
modulus, the frequency ratio could be lowered to 50, while for controlling
the peak force with a 10% accuracy a frequency ratio of 10 could be
enough. High-frequency ratios imply limitations to acquire data at
high speed. For optimum frequency ratios, nanoscale force spectroscopy
can measure the Young’s modulus of any solid surface from 1
kPa to 100 GPa.

Methods
Numerical
solutions of eq 5 and eq 10 were
obtained using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm with
different tip–sample force models at a given distance zc. For nanomechanical spectroscopy we use a
model that takes into account a repulsive contact regime, a viscous
speed-dependent term, and a small adhesion term: 13  where D, Eeff, η, R, δ, H, and a0 are the tip–sample
distance,
the effective Young’s modulus, the viscosity, the tip radius,
the indentation, the van der Waals constant, and the intermolecular
distance, respectively. For stiff contact (η = 0) we set a0 = 0.2 nm and H = 0.5 eV in
air and H = 0 eV in liquid (only the first term remains).
For soft contact (η ≠ 0) we consider H = 0 eV and only the first and third terms remain. For unbinding
force simulations, we use a different adhesion term during the tip
withdrawal (see eq 12), and we set η = 0. We consider a spherical tip with R = 5 nm of negligible mass only for interaction purposes
in all cases.
