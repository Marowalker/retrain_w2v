We demonstrate a
versatile, catalyst free chemical vapor deposition
process on insulating substrates capable of producing in one single
stream one-dimensional (1D) WO3–x suboxides leading to a wide range of substrate-supported 2H-WS2 polymorphs: a tunable class of out-of-plane (of the substrate)
nanophases, with 1D nanotubes and a pure WS2, two-dimensional
(2D) nanomesh (defined as a network of webbed, micron-size, few-layer
2D sheets) at its extremes; and in-plane (parallel to the substrate)
mono- and few-layer 2D domains. This entails a two-stage approach
in which the 2WO3 + 7S → 2WS2 + 3SO2 reaction is intentionally decoupled. First, various morphologies
of nanowires or nanorods of high stoichiometry, WO2.92/WO2.9 suboxides (belonging to the class of Magnéli phases)
were formed, followed by their sulfurization to undergo reduction
to the aforementioned WS2 polymorphs. The continuous transition
of WS2 from nanotubes to the out-of-plane 2D nanomesh, via intermediary, mixed 1D-2D phases, delivers tunable functional
properties, for example, linear and nonlinear optical properties,
such as reflectivity (linked to optical excitations in the material),
and second harmonic generation (SHG) and onset of saturable absorption.
The SHG effect is very strong across the entire tunable class of WS2 nanomaterials, weakest in nanotubes, and strongest in the
2D nanomesh. Furthermore, a mechanism via suboxide
(WO3–x) intermediate as a possible
path to 2D domain growth is demonstrated. 2D, in-plane WS2 domains grow via “self-seeding and feeding”
where short WO2.92/WO2.9 nanorods provide both
the nucleation sites and the precursor feedstock. Understanding the
reaction path (here, in the W–O–S space) is an emerging
approach toward controlling the nucleation, growth, and morphology
of 2D domains and films of transition-metal dichalcogenides.

==== Body
Two-dimensional
(2D) transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), the inorganic analogues of graphene, have
attracted significant attention in recent years.1−5 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has emerged as one
of the most efficient and versatile methods for the large area synthesis
of a wide range of 2D TMDs.6−11 By varying deposition parameters and improving the CVD apparatus,
larger and larger domain TMD mono- and few-layer films have been recently
reported.12,13

Among the more than 40 varieties of
TMDs,14 WS2 and WSe2 have attracted significant attention
due to their giant spin–orbit splitting, a property of particular
interest for spintronics,15 as well as
optical materials.16,17 In the case of WS2, WO3 and S powders are the precursors most widely used
for growth by CVD.18 WO3 is
converted into WS2 by sulfurization with the proposed reaction
being 2WO3 + 7S → 2WS2 + 3SO2.19 However, this conversion process is
not trivial, as the W atom sites in the WO3 monoclinic
cell differ significantly from those in the WS2 hexagonal
unit cell, requiring the nearest W–W interatomic distances
along the a and c axes to change
significantly, that is, from 0.38 nm in WO3 to 0.315 nm
in WS2 along the a axis and from 0.38
nm in WO3 to 0.62 nm in WS2 along the c axis.20 An intermediate WO3–x suboxide stage, which would allow
for partial displacement of W atoms and facilitate the conversion,
was demonstrated in the growth of WS2 nanotubes,21,22 but has never been exploited so far for 2D growth. In general, in
conventional in-plane (parallel to substrate) 2D growth, where WO3 is rapidly reduced and sulfurized in an optimal S atmosphere,
a couple of studies have reported oxi-sulfides instead of suboxides
as the reaction intermediates, though no common growth mechanism has
emerged.9,23

In conventional 2D growth via CVD, the operational
window for optimal, monolayer growth is very narrow. In general, it
is necessary to avoid premature mixing of the WO3 with
S vapor as this interferes with WO3 sublimation, causing
a deficit of W precursor and, hence, precluding WS2 formation
on the growth substrate.24 If S is introduced
too late, however, an excess of WO3 precursor will arrive
at the substrate resulting in the growth of thick multilayer WS2 or W nanowires.24,25 The question is then:
How early (late) is too early (late)? Hu et al.25 reported that introducing S 6 min before the
WO3 precursor reaches the target temperature provides optimal
conditions for maximum size growth of WS2 (with ∼150
μm lateral size of domains). However, if S was introduced only
4 min before the WO3 precursor reaches the target temperature,
the WS2 domains became thicker and much smaller (20–30
μm in lateral size).25 In contrast,
in most of the reported works for CVD growth of WS2, S
was introduced simultaneously with WO3,26−34 corresponding to the case of “too late” in refs (24 and 25). It is clear that the conditions for optimal CVD growth of monolayer
WS2 are very sensitive to the specific CVD configuration.
It is thus of interest to explore if other 2D growth regimes exist
that rely less on the precise timing of S and WO3 introduction
into the gas phase.

Here, we intentionally created an initial
S-deficient environment,
in order to decouple the overall CVD reaction into a two-stage process.
We thus took the decoupling idea to the extreme and created a WO3–x phase with nanorod morphologies
as precursors, which we then sulfurized. This approach has similarities
with the concept underpinning the synthesis of WS2 nanotubes,
obtained by sulfurization of WO3–x nanowires.35,36 As a result of stage decoupling,
which does not occur in conventional CVD of 2D TMDs, we were able
to show that 2D growth of WS2 can occur via the WO2.92/WO2.9 suboxides and hence demonstrate
a viable suboxide path to 2D growth. This approach also allowed us
to demonstrate a facile, tunable CVD route capable of flexibly producing
in a single process stream a variety of WS2 phases, spanning
from one-dimensional (1D) to 2D, as well as grown in-plane or out-of-plane.
Through this process, a 2D nanomesh, described as an out-of-plane
network of webbed 2D sheets (of mainly one to three WS2 layers) with large, μm-range lateral domain size was created;
this is the ultimate stage in an evolutionary process started with
the WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowires, from which WS2 nanotubes with WO3–x cores
formed, which then gave rise to 2D sheets as the S-mediated reduction
process progressed. The tunability and functionality of this class
of WS2 materials are demonstrated through comparative investigations
of the optical properties of representative phases obtained at progressing
stages: the 1D, nanotube-based phase vs an intermediary
phase of mixed 1D/2D content and, finally, vs the
2D nanomesh. We thus measured (i) reflectivity and correlated it with
optical excitations, as well as (ii) nonlinear optical properties,
that is, second harmonic generation (SHG) and onset of saturable absorption,
in the three types of materials. All the WS2 materials
in the class showed strong nonlinear optical properties, with the
2D nanomesh being most SHG active. Finally, we showed that in this
decoupled, two-stage growth, in-plane 2D mono- and few-layer WS2 can be grown in a “self-seeding and feeding”
process, where the nucleation sites and the source of precursor material
are provided by the same phase; unlike in heterogeneous seeding processes
demonstrated so far, where organic molecular species were used as
seeds.6,8,37

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents
the flowchart for the catalyst-free CVD processes discussed in this
work, showing the inter-relation, and contrasting differences, between
the conventional growth of 2D domains38 and the processes and phases enabled by the decoupling of the overall
reaction into two distinct stages.

Figure 1 Flow-chart describing the decoupled, two-stage
strategy for synthesis
of crystalline WS2 nanophases starting from WO3 and sulfur powders as precursors, mapped onto a two-stage reaction.
Stage 1 (blue arrows), a low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) process, where partial
reduction of WO3 takes place in an S-deficient atmosphere,
leads to the formation of various WO3–x morphologies, that is, long out-of-plane nanowires, short
in-plane nanorods, and short nanorod bundles. From each of these morphologies,
distinct, pure WS2 nanophases result after sulfurization
in stage 2 (red arrows), such as an out-of-plane 2D nanomesh, as well
as 2D in-plane domains of various sizes; this is an atmospheric pressure
CVD (APCVD) process. Conventional in-plane 2D domain growth, obtained
by WO3 fast reduction in an optimal S atmosphere, is indicated
by the green arrow.

During 2D growth the
reaction ideally happens in the vapor phase:
WO3 is partially reduced by the sulfur vapor to form volatile
WO3–x suboxide species, which are
then further sulfurized to form large crystalline domains of mono-
and few-layer WS2 on substrates. However, the reaction
occurs too fast for any intermediary stages to be observed and confirmed.
In contrast, here we intentionally decouple the reaction into two
stages. In our decoupled reaction, we engineered a first reaction
stage (WO3 partial reduction performed below atmospheric
pressure, blue arrows on Figure 1) where the vapor phase is S-deficient, leading to
the initial growth of 1D WO3–x morphologies,
such as nanowires or short nanorods. Then, in a second stage (sulfurization
at atmospheric pressure, red arrows on Figure 1), the nanowires/nanorods are reacted in
an S-rich atmosphere for varying amounts of time, ultimately leading
to the formation of pure WS2 nanophases characterized by
the emergence of 2D domains and crystallites. It is apparent (see Figures 2–5) that the type of 1D suboxide morphology in the
first stage and the period of sulfurization in the second stage control
the resulting WS2 nanophases: (i) using long, out-of-plane
WO3–x nanowires as precursors yielded
WS2 nanotubes, a hybrid 1D/2D film, or an out-of-plane
2D nanomesh, while (ii) short nanorod precursors yielded in-plane
2D WS2 growth. By performing further structural analysis,
we were able to demonstrate that the two growth stages map onto the
two hypothesized reaction stages:39,40 (i) 2WO3 + xS → 2WO3–x + xSO2 and (ii) 2WO3–x + (7 – x)S → 2WS2 + (3 – x)SO2. We thus
confirm this two-stage reaction mechanism and the involvement of suboxides
as intermediary subspecies.

the formation of few-layer
multiwalled nanotubes with suboxide cores. (a, b) SEM of pure WO3–x nanowires before and after 10 min

WS2-rich phase (labeled “2”), interspersed
with a residual pure WO3–x phase
(labeled “1”). Their respective Raman spectra (excitation
wavelength of 532 nm) are shown in (c) and (d). (e, f) TEM images
of the sulfurized nanorods showing multiwalled nanotubes of large
diameter and relatively few layers. In (e), the highlighted FFT inset
vectors correspond to 0.27 nm, the distance between the (100) planes
of 2H-WS2 crystals, and to 0.62 nm, the van der Waals intertube
distance. In (f), the WO2.92 suboxide core nanowire is
still visible. The FFT inset highlights, in addition to the distances
identified in (e), 0.382 nm along the long axis of the suboxide core,
which corresponds to the distance between the (010) planes of monoclinic
WO2.92.

WO3–x nanowire/nanorod morphologies
were obtained in the first reaction stage (Figure 1), using a home-built low-pressure CVD (LPCVD)
reactor involving a horizontal furnace with a temperature gradient
(Methods and Supporting Information, Figure S1). The boat containing the WO3 precursor was placed in the center of the furnace, within its constant
temperature zone; temperature was ramped to 1030 °C, at a pressure
below 10–1 mbar, and then held constant for 20 min,
to ensure sufficient sublimation. Subsequently, the sulfur powder,
placed in a boat 40 cm upstream of the WO3 boat, was heated
to 200 °C over 10 min and then co-evaporated together with the
WO3 over 15 min. Another boat with four pockets, each 2
cm long, and containing SiO2/Si substrates, was placed
6 cm downstream of the WO3 boat, in a zone with a temperature
gradient. Only argon was used for transporting the WO3 and
sulfur vapor to the SiO2/Si substrates. According to the
temperature profile of the furnace, there is a temperature drop of
about 60 °C between each substrate-containing pocket. This enabled
a W precursor concentration gradient across the various substrate
locations,41,42 leading to a continuous variation
in the growth conditions. In contrast, the long separation distance
between the S and substrate boats ensured that the S vapor concentration
gradient across the Si/SiO2 substrates can be ignored,
unlike that of WO3.

Depending on the position and
temperature of the substrate relative
to the W precursor, different WO3–x morphologies were obtained (Figures 2 and 5, see also Supporting
Information, Figure S1). (i) In the pocket
furthest from the W precursor, the relatively low temperature of around
780 °C induces a low diffusion rate of the precursor, leading
to the precursor being trapped at many random sites on the substrate.
After the nucleation sites become saturated with precursor, further
trapping of precursor results in crystallization and growth. A high
carrier gas flow rate (∼150 sccm) promotes mass transfer, which
contributes to a fast crystal growth rate41 leading to the formation of long, out-of-plane nanowires (Figures 2 and 3), and Supporting Information, Figure S2). (ii) The pocket closer to the WO3 boat was
reached by a higher concentration of W precursor, while also being
held at the highest temperature, 1000 °C, of all the substrates.
In general, a high temperature induces a high diffusion rate of the
precursor, favoring film growth. On the other hand, too high a temperature
causes large thermal turbulence, resulting in an instability of as-grown
nucleation sites43 and hindering growth.
Hence, under these conditions of temperature and W precursor concentration
short nanorod bundles were formed (Figure 5d, and Supporting Information, Figure S2). (iii) In between these high and low
temperature regimes, in a pocket located in an intermediate position
at about 960 °C, the decrease in precursor concentration results
in a crystal growth rate slow-down: The positive influence of a high
flow rate balanced by a moderate diffusion rate of precursor at a
moderate temperature leads to stable, while slow, crystal growth under
thermodynamic control. Hence, short, in-plane nanorods could be grown
(Figure 5b).

Figure 3 Full sulfurization
of long, out-of-plane WO2.92 and
WO2.9 suboxide nanowires, shown in (a), leads to a pure
WS2 2D nanomesh, shown in (b). The sulfurization was typically
performed over a period Δt of 3 h. The emergence
and purity of the 2H-WS2 phase were verified by a combination
of (c) HRTEM (and associated FFT, example shown in inset) and (d)
XRD, where the identified crystallographic planes are also shown.
In (c), a typical WS2 crystallite with two layers is shown.

We now analyze the outcome of
stage 2—sulfurization—of
the decoupled reaction diagrammatically shown in Figure 1, where each of the three nanowire/nanorod
morphologies described above are reacted with sulfur.

WO3–x Long Nanowires as Precursors
Figure 2a shows
the WO3–x nanowires grown on the
SiO2/Si substrate (Methods): Their
diameters fall in a narrow range, 10–30 nm, and they can reach
several microns in length. A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD)
(Supporting Information, Figure S2) and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that
WO2.92 (W25O73) and WO2.9 (W20O58) are the phases encountered in the
nanowires (Supporting Information, Figure S2a–d). Indeed, fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the examples
given in Supporting Information, Figure S2c,d show periodicities along the long axis of the nanorods that correspond
to 3.82 and 3.78 Å, respectively, which are in good agreement
with the b lattice parameters of monoclinic WO2.9244 and WO2.9.45 Both of these suboxides belong to the substoichiometric
Magnéli phases, which have the series formula of WnO3n–2.46 Most importantly, both suboxides are nonvolatile
(see Methods) but can be reduced further into
volatile suboxides (see discussion below) at the temperatures used
in the subsequent sulfurization stage from Figure 1; this is consequential, as it strongly influences
the type of WS2 nanostructures that can be obtained by
sulfurization, as demonstrated in the following.

The as-grown
WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowires on SiO2/Si
were sulfurized as described in Methods, at
atmospheric pressure (an APCVD process), in the first instance over
∼10 min. Figure 2b shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the resulting
post-sulfurized nanowires: Two types of material, with different electronic
contrast, can be observed. The brighter areas have very broad Raman
peaks at 271, 326, 714, and 803 cm–1 (Figure 2d). Peaks centered at 714 and
803 cm–1 are attributed to W–O stretching
vibration modes, while the two lower peaks at 272 and 326 cm–1 are induced by O–W–O bending vibration modes,47 identifying these regions as nonconverted, pure
suboxide phases. Raman spectroscopy confirms that the regions that
appear dark in both optical and SEM images are 2H-WS2 (Figure 2c, and Supporting
Information, Figure S3): The 352.5 and
418 cm–1 peaks correspond to the E12g and A1g vibrational modes, respectively, of this
phase, while their spectral distance of ∼65.5 cm–1 shows that the phase is made up of few-layer WS2 nanotubes.48 HRTEM (Figure 2e,f) confirms that the sulfurized nanowire-shaped morphologies
are actually the suboxide nanowires transforming into multilayered
WS2 nanotubes. The HRTEM images and their associated FFTs
(inset panels) give a spacing between the layers of the nanotubes
of about 0.62 nm, consistent with the (002) d-spacing
within a multilayer 2H-WS2 crystal. The nanotubes are partially
filled with WO2.92 or WO2.9 suboxides cores,
as demonstrated by Figure 2f; the associated FFT identifies the core inside the nanotube
as WO2.92 based on its b lattice parameter.
However, despite the presence of W suboxide cores inside some of the
nanotubes, Raman spectroscopy does not detect any of their W–O
vibration modes; a similar behavior was previously reported for other
core–shell systems.48,49 The coexistence of
WS2 nanotubes and W suboxides is reminiscent, in this respect,
of the work from Tenne’s group on the synthesis of MoS2 and WS2 nanotubes.36,50 Therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that the WS2-rich areas from Figure 2b are actually a
proto-stage of the growth of WS2 nanotubes around the suboxide
nanowire cores.

In contrast to here, previous works on the synthesis
of WS2 nanotubes mainly used W oxide nanowires formed by
the hydrothermal
method, which primarily consisted of the nonvolatile, low-stoichiometry
WO2.72 (W18O49) phase; this is the
so-called reduction-resistance phase and will not undergo further
reduction.36,51 In their work based on vapor
phase reaction in a fluidized bed reactor, Tenne et al.35 have found that several intermediate,
higher stoichiometry suboxides could also be present during the formation
of their WO3–x nanowires; however,
the nonvolatile WO2.72 was identified as the resulting
stable phase in the nanowires, which then served as a template for
the subsequent sulfurization reaction yielding WS2 nanotubes.
The transformation of the suboxide nanowires into WS2 nanotubes
is then diffusion-controlled, and such conversion takes place slowly
and layer-by-layer relying on the sulfur diffusing to the core. In
our case, however, with further annealing in a S-rich environment,
the high stoichiometry WO2.92 or WO2.9 nanowire
cores, rather than being sulfurized layer-by-layer, are able to transform
to lower stoichiometry, volatile WO3–x phases; 3 – x could be 2.89 (i.e., WO2.89 (W19O55))52 or in the range 2.72–2.83
that contains volatile phases.36,51,52 Such phases can then escape through the open/defective ends of the
nanotubes. This results in a higher conversion rate to WS2, which can then nucleate and grow as 2D sheets outside the nanotubes
(see Figure 4 and related
discussion).

Figure 4 Evolution with sulfurization time, Δt, of
the suboxide cores into WS2 nanophases. (a) Several stages
(i–v) were identified, mapping onto representative TEM images
(c–e): WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowires (i) become
covered with few-layer nanotube sheaths (ii) in a layer-by-layer conversion
of suboxide into 2H-WS2; (iii) WO2.92/WO2.9 core suboxide reduces to a lower stoichiometry, volatile
suboxide which leaves the tubes and nucleates into 2H-WS2 sheets at the tube apex; (iv) WS2 2D domains grow by
epitaxy on the body of the nanotubes, which are then subjected to
gradual opening; (v) finally, nanotubes fully open and merge with
extended 2D 2H-WS2 sheets. (b) The emergence of the volatile
suboxide phase, with 1, 2, and 4 showing crystalline suboxide, while
3 and 5 show regions of reduced crystallinity (boundary between the
two regions shown with dashed line). (c) WS2 nanotubes
(2 and 3) have no suboxide filling and nucleated 2H-WS2 sheets at the apex of the tube, while (1) shows the breached end
of a nanotube through which filling material can escape. (d) Large
2D WS2 sheets nucleated all along the body of the nanotube,
which is still partially filled. The unfilled region shows gradual
nanotube opening, while the zoomed area highlighted in the inset figure
shows the nanotube layers fusing with the grown 2D sheets. (e) Extended,
micron-wide 2D sheets grown all along the nanotubes’ bodies.

Hence, sulfurization, in the first
stage, produces single- or few-wall
WS2 nanotubes, with partial cores of suboxide still present;
the layer-by-layer conversion does not continue long enough to involve
full transformation of the WO2.92/WO2.9 cores
into the nanotube phase as suboxide material leaves the nanotubes.
In contrast, from the nonvolatile WO2.72 phase, thick multilayered
nanotubes with empty cores are generated. For instance, as shown by
HRTEM in Figure 2e,f,
we could obtain trilayer WS2 nanotubes of diameter more
than 25 nm using the WO2.92/WO2.9 precursors,
while from the lower stoichiometry, reduction-resistant, WO2.72 precursor, nanotubes of around 20 nm in diameter have more than
10 layers.53

In order to determine
the ultimate effect of the sulfurization,
the long, out-of-plane nanowires were continuously sulfurized under
the same conditions for a large period, typically <3 h. A final
morphology was then achieved: Figure 3b shows a 2D nanomesh structure of webbed 2D crystallites,
extending out-of-plane for microns (up to ∼10 μm), and
with a very large specific surface area. Figure 3c presents the TEM image, and associated
FFT, of a typical crystallite, which has a hexagonal lattice structure
with 0.27 nm periodicity resulting from the (100) planes of 2H-WS2,54 and two layers are visible.
A representative nanomesh XRD spectrum is shown in Figure 3d. All the diffraction peaks
are indexed relative to the hexagonal P63/mmc space group, indicating that the structure of the WS2 phase is 2H-WS2, while there is almost no trace
of W suboxide peaks. The sharpness of the peaks demonstrates the good
crystallinity of the sample overall.

Between these two extremes,
the WS2 material can be
evolved in a continuous manner, with a variable proportion of nanotube
(1D) and 2D phases, as depicted by stages (i–v) in Figure 4a. Figure 4b–e shows TEM images
of the material at different stages of sulfurization. After the formation
of an initial nanotube sheath around the WO2.92/WO2.9 cores, volatile WO3–x suboxide (obtained by subsequent reduction of the nonvolatile WO2.92/WO2.9) forms and then leaves the nanotubes
through their open ends (or, alternatively, through wall defects that
sometimes develop) (Figure 4b) and nucleates 2D crystallites at the nanotubes’
ends (Figure 4c). The
nanotube exterior provides an ideal surface for subsequent epitaxial
growth of 2D domains, the evolution of which is often accompanied
by a gradual opening of the nanotubes, presumably catalyzed by stresses
on the nanotube bonds induced by the 2D growth (Figures 4d,e). “Un-zipping” of WS2 nanotubes was previously reported, though based on Li intercalation.55 Once opened, the 2D sheets and the nanotube
edge can also fuse, as shown in the inset of Figure 4d. Figure 4a shows diagrammatically the various stages of this
evolution, from WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowires, through
WS2 nanotubes (with partial suboxide cores), then hybrid
1D/2D materials, and finally into a pure WS2 2D nanomesh.

The formation of the pure WS2 2D nanomesh, with extensive
2D content (Figure 3b) is in contrast to other recently reported hybrid phases which
were a mixture of 2D WS2 crystallites and WO356 or had a mixed 1D-2D character, with
a main nanowire phase and a small 2D phase content.57 Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements on our
pure WS2 2D nanomesh (Supporting Information, Figure S5) demonstrate the semiconducting nature
of this phase, while an activation energy Ea ≈ 0.33 eV indicates thermally activated transport, via a defect band, around (and just below) room temperature.
Further optical properties of this nanomesh are presented in the last
section.

WO3–x Short Nanorods as Precursors
Figure 5a shows the results of atmospheric pressure sulfurization
in a region of lower density of suboxide nanowires. It is clear that
less dense nanowires yield relatively larger and more separated, out-of-plane
2D WS2 crystallites. This suggests that if the W suboxide
nanowires are well-separated and oriented in plane, they may be used
as seeds for the growth of in-plane 2D WS2 films.

Figure 5 Effect of sulfurization
of sparse WO2.92/WO2.9 nanorods revealing seeded
growth of in-plane 2D 2H-WS2 domains. (a) Sulfurization
of low-density, out-of-plane nanowires
leads to extended and more separated WS2 2D crystallites;
shown by SEM. (b, c) In-plane, individual, short nanorods lead to
seeded, root growth of polygonal domains of multilayered WS2; shown by SEM. (d, e) Bundles of short nanorods lead to seeded,
in-plane growth of larger single-layered 2D WS2 domains:
(e) is a bright field, optical image, while (d) and inset of (e) are
SEM images. (f) Raman spectroscopy (at 532 nm excitation) of single-layered
WS2 from (e), in top panel, and of multilayered WS2 from (c), in bottom panel. The spectral distance Δω
between the E12g (Γ) and A1g (Γ) vibrational modes of WS2 is used to identify
the number of layers within the 2D domains.

Hence, as-grown in-plane, single, short WO2.92/WO2.9 nanorods on SiO2/Si were similarly sulfurized
(Methods), and Figure 5b,c shows the result of such a scenario:
In-plane, triangular, few-layer 2D domains grow from the nanorods
at their basis. This root growth is enabled by the same transformation
stage sequence shown in Figure 4a, with the volatile suboxide emerging from the WS2 nanotubes and converting to WS2 domains that nucleate
directly onto the SiO2/Si substrate, thus keeping the material
localized around the original nanorod. Raman spectroscopy confirms
that the domains grown are WS2, albeit thicker than monolayers
(Figure 5f and Supporting
Information, Figure S5b). This result demonstrates
the feasibility of using W suboxide nanorods as seeds for the 2D in-plane
growth of WS2. Seeded growth of 2D WS2 domains
has been studied by using either large aromatic molecules (e.g., perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
acid tetra-potassium salt (PTAS))6,8,37 or patterned oxide precursor particles58 as externally introduced nucleation sites, over
which W- and S-carrying species were subsequently introduced. However,
in our case, the seed is provided by the suboxide nanorods without
introducing other external contamination. Moreover, the 2D domain
growth can be treated as a “self-seeding and feeding”
one, in which the suboxide nanorods provide both the nucleation sites
and the W precursor feedstock for the growth of layers.

In “self-seeding
and feeding”, the size of the in-plane
2D domains that can be grown is constrained by the amount of W precursor
available in the seeds. Hence, larger 2D domains could be grown by
increasing the amount of precursor delivered by the nanorod seeds.
Therefore, as shown in Figure 5d, we used clusters of short W suboxide nanorods as the precursors
in the sulfurization stage; these clusters have also been confirmed
by XRD to be a mixture of WO2.92 and WO2.9 phases
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). Optical/SEM
images (Figure 5e)
and Raman characterization (Figure 5f and Supporting Information, Figure S5a) show that their sulfurization resulted in the growth of
in-plane triangular domains of predominantly monolayer 2D WS2 domains. These domains are also substantially larger than the multilayer
domains shown in Figure 5c obtained from single nanorods as seeds. As the amount of precursor
and distance to the substrate increased compared to the case of single,
in-plane nanorods, the WS2 domains now grow via a mixture of reaction mechanisms: Root growth (as observed in Figure 5c) competes with
gas-phase transport and reaction. Indeed, by the reduction of WO2.92/WO2.9 to lower-stoichiometry, volatile WO3–x phases (as per the mechanism depicted in Figure 4a), the latter can readily transfer to vapor phase
as in situ precursor to supply the conversion reaction.
The W suboxide seed growth demonstrated above is distinct from a recently
shown process where WS2 nanotubes were sublimated in order
to induce WS2 monolayer growth by vapor phase transport
and surface diffusion.59,60

“Self-seeding and
feeding” from precursor nanowires
could potentially be harnessed by controlling nanowire growth via substrate engineering, thereby allowing for the positional
control of WS2 domain growth, while the limited feedstock
of material would limit the resulting domain size and facilitate patterning.
For example, when sapphire, a substrate frequently used in TMD growth,19,61−63 with unstable orientations is annealed at high temperature,
it spontaneously becomes periodically faceted.64 Specifically, the mis-cut C plane (0001) (2° toward
[11̅00]) facets into L-shaped nanosteps, while the M plane (101̅0)
facets into V-shaped nanogrooves. It has been demonstrated that various
types of nanowires (e.g., of ZnO,65 GaAs,66 or GaN,67etc.) could be grown with a
good degree of alignment on both these facets. Furthermore, tungsten
oxide nanorods have been reported to epitaxially grow on mica using
a simple vapor–solid growth process.68

Figure 6 shows,
as a corollary, the various pathways uncovered so far in previous
works for the 2D growth of TMDs from transition-metal trioxides.9,23,69,70 On paths 2 and 3, corresponding to conventional 2D growth, W or
Mo oxi-sulfide nanoparticles first formed and were adsorbed on substrates
as nucleation cores for further reduction. No common growth mechanism
has emerged from these studies, the various proposed scenarios being
inconsistent with each other and resulting in different and complex
reactions paths. In contrast, path 1 highlights the suboxide route
to 2D growth demonstrated in this work. A common mechanism can explain
both in-plane and out-of-plane 2D growth processes which rely on the
initial formation of WO2.92 and WO2.9 (blue
arrow on the W–O–S phase diagram). Our process of 2D
WS2 synthesis always starts with the formation of few-layer
WS2 nanotubes around the WO2.92/WO2.92 cores. Nanotube formation is controlled by the specific crystallographic
structure of the Magnéli suboxide phases which contain crystallographic
shear (CS) planes (Supporting Information, Figure S6) created as result of oxygen vacancies introduced by reduction.
At the atomic level, the shear process is equivalent to the diffusion
of an atom to a neighboring lattice vacancy; however, it was previously
proposed that the octahedra hop as a whole during the process leads
to the formation of edge sharing octahedral units, that is, the CS
planes (Supporting Information, Figure S6), as opposed to corner sharing ones.20,71 While the
reaction progresses, regions of such edge-sharing octahedral units
develop across the crystal. The edge-sharing octahedral units in WO2.92 and WO2.9 are now similar to the 1T-WS2 octahedral structure (Supporting Information, Figure S6). As the sulfurization proceeds, O
atoms are released from the lattices of the Magnéli phases
and replaced by S atoms, leading to the expansion of the unit cell
along the c axis, while the W–W bond length
in the edge-sharing octahedral units of WO2.92/WO2.9 is already very similar to that of 2H-WS2 (Supporting
Information, Figure S6). This process is
depicted by the dotted arrow on the W–O–S phase diagram
of path 1 on Figure 6. This WO2.92/WO2.9 route is supported by recent
findings that starting directly from WO2.9 as a precursor
(as opposed to WO3 and without controlling the intermediary
reaction) promotes 2D growth of larger and more uniform domains of
WSe2/WS2.27,72 Finally, in our scenario,
the 2D WS2 sheets always form after the formation of the
nanotubes, and the reaction path is depicted by the green-red path
on the W–O–S phase diagram; thus, the residual WO2.92/WO2.9 from inside the nanotubes converts into
lower stoichiometry, volatile Magnéli WO3–x phases, which can escape the nanotubes and nucleate
as WS2 outside them, and then evolve into extended 2D sheets
as described in Figure 4a.

Figure 6 W–O–S ternary phase diagrams showing reaction pathways
to 2D 2H-WS2 during CVD growth from WO3 and
sulfur precursors. Path 1 (left diagram) describes a reaction mechanism via the nonvolatile WO2.92/WO2.9 phases
and their subsequent reduction to lower stoichiometry, volatile WO3–x phases, as shown in this work.
2D growth corresponds to the blue-green-red path, while the black,
dotted path corresponds to 1D (nanotube) phase synthesis. Paths 2
(middle) and 3 (right), identified in conventional 2D growth of WS2, highlight reaction mechanisms where oxi-sulfides are the
intermediary compounds.

Finally, we investigated some of the opportunities afforded
by
the tunability of the relative 1D to 2D content of the material. Hence,
we measured and contrasted the linear optical properties (Methods) of out-of-plane, nanotube-rich and 2D nanomesh
samples, as well as an intermediary sample with mixed 1D/2D content,
and related them to the relevant optical excitations that can occur
in them. The nonlinear optical behavior of these three samples was
subsequently tested (Methods). Figure 7a, left, shows a photograph
of the 2D nanomesh sample, demonstrating its homogeneity over a large
area (>8 × 8 mm2), while at a magnification ×100,
randomly distributed structures appear well resolved in dark-field
illumination (Figure 7a, right). In order to obtain reflectance spectra, illumination was
switched to bright-field, and measurements were taken at normal incidence
with unpolarized light. Figure 7b shows characteristic optical reflection spectra from all
three samples: (i) nanotube-rich, (ii) with intermediary 1D/2D content,
and (iii) the 2D nanomesh, normalized to the reflectivity of the SiO2/Si substrate. Over the 400–650 nm range, all three
samples exhibit dips in reflectivity, marked with A, B, and C, corresponding
to increased extinction. These can be attributed to excitonic resonances
for A and B and optical absorption between density of states peaks
in the valence and conductions bands for C, in agreement with previous
reports.73,74 For the nanotube-rich sample, these spectral
features are located at 628, 521.7, and around 450 nm, respectively,
and red-shifted relative to the intermediary 1D/2D content sample
and the 2D nanomesh. The intermediary, mixed 1D/2D content sample
has spectral features close to the 2D nanomesh, owing to its large
2D content, though its nonlinear optical properties are distinctive
compared to the other two samples in the series (see Figure 8b). For the 2D nanomesh, A,
B, and C are located at 622.5, 515.8, and ∼443 nm, respectively,
in good agreement with spectra of mechanically exfoliated mono- and
bilayer WS2 sheets,73 indicating
the prevalence of mono- and bilayer WS2 sheets in our material;
in comparison, thicker 2D sheets have their spectral features red-shifted.73 The broadening of the A, B, and C features relative
to those measured on mechanically exfoliated WS2 2D layers
of well-defined thickness73 likely reflects
the (thickness) polydisperse nature of all three samples as well as
the presence of defects in these materials. Above 700 nm, in the nanotube-rich
sample, there is a very broad spectral feature centered around 760
nm, and a counterpart can be seen around 840 nm in both the 2D nanomesh
sample and the one with mixed 1D/2D content. Due to their broadness
and the large spectral difference (∼80 nm) between their location
for the three samples, as well as the lack of known possible excitations
in this spectral region in (perfect) laterally extended WS2 sheets (mono- or few-layer) or bulk crystals, it is more likely
that these spectral features are caused by geometrical/morphological
characteristics of the two samples. For nanotubes of diameters comparable
with the excitation light wavelength and with many layers (i.e., creating a material with high refractive
index), cavity mode resonances can be excited, for example, 760 nm
excitation can excite cavity modes in a 70 nm radius WS2 multilayer nanotube, while by decreasing the nanotube radius, the
wavelength of the light that can excite cavity modes decreases.74 Consequently, as the nanotube diameters in our
nanotube-rich sample are in the 10–30 nm range, no cavity resonances
can be excited in the spectral range investigated here, and such excitations
can thereby be ruled out. Most likely, the broad spectral features
are sample geometry or morphology related, for example, the result
of a collective behavior of the material. Tentatively, we propose
an explanation based on the nanotube-rich material and the 2D nanomesh
being approximated as homogeneous films with distinctive effective
refractive indices, neff, of about 4 for
the pure WS2 2D nanomesh,74 and
moving closer to 2 for the nanotube-rich sample where the cores of
the nanotubes are air or WO3–x.75 In this approximation, the broad spectral features
in the near-infrared region can be interpreted as antiresonances (manifested
as dips in reflectivity) resulting from interference of light reflected
from the top and bottom interfaces of the effective WS2 film, and the wavelength at which an antiresonance occurs increases
with neff. In addition, the morphology
of the film can affect how pronounced an antiresonance is, and it
is expected that the homogeneous film approximation works better for
the nanotube-rich sample than for the 2D nanomesh where the multiple
2D planes produce more scattering and higher overall reflectivity.
Hence the antiresonance effect would manifest at larger wavelength
and be weaker in the 2D nanomesh, which appears to agree with the
experimental findings. More investigations are needed to clarify the
origin of these broad spectral features.

and for the Si substrate used as a reference (right Y axis, indicated by black arrow). Error bars representative for the
experiment can be seen in the low signal data from Si; these are too
small to be visible on the WS2 data. The continuous lines
are fits to quadratic functions characteristic of SHG behavior (R2 = 0.91; 0.97; 0.98; and 0.998 for the 2D nanomesh,
mixed 1D/2D content, nanotube-rich (1D) samples, and Si substrate,
respectively); deviations of data from these lines demonstrate onset
of saturable absorption.

Figure 7d
presents
spectral maps of the reflection intensity of each of the nanotube-rich
and 2D nanomesh samples, as a function of the angle of incidence,
where the measurements were taken with polarized light using the setup
from Figure 7c (Methods). For both P-polarized lights (upper panels),
the spectral signatures appear to correlate well with those in Figure 7b, including the
A, B, and C features, and do not change significantly upon varying
the angle of incidence. Consequently, these spectral signatures are
specific to WS2 as a material. For S-polarized light, the
spectral maps are also modulated by the features shown in Figure 7b; however, there
is a stronger contribution from the broad spectral features located
above 700 nm. This suggests that the S-polarized light couples more
effectively with the sample as a whole, hence these maps reflect more
the geometric/morphologic characteristics of the two types of samples
rather than being specific to their common WS2 constituent
material.

Because of their large second-order nonlinear susceptibility,
2D
materials such as WS2 are of significant interest for nonlinear
optical devices.17,76−79 We measured the SHG for the same
three types of samples investigated in Figure 7b, in the reflection geometry, using the
setup from Figure 8a. SHG is a nonlinear optical technique whereby two photons at the
fundamental frequency are annihilated to create a third photon, at
double the frequency. Because this frequency-doubling process is exquisitely
symmetry sensitive, it is used to characterize symmetry-breaking effects,
such as externally applied electric80 and
magnetic81 fields, strain,82 chirality,83 localized surface
electric fields,84 and surface roughness,
down to the atomic monolayer.85

The
experiments were conducted using a fundamental (incident) light
of 800 nm wavelength and 100 fs laser pulses. Figure 8b shows the SHG intensity (at 400 nm) as
a function of incident power of the fundamental light (at 800 nm),
for the nanotube-based (1D-rich), intermediary with mixed 1D/2D content,
and the 2D nanomesh samples, respectively. As a reference, the SHG
signal generated by the Si substrate, which is a centrosymmetric material
with low SHG response,86,87 is also shown. All three types
of WS2 samples are extremely nonlinear, showing between
104 and 105 larger SHG intensity than Si at
a given power. It should be noted that our SHG setup is built for
sensitivity, with a detector upper limit set to about 105 counts/s, which imposes an experimental limit on the power incident
on the sample. Figure 8b also unambiguously shows the SHG response is influenced by the
type of WS2 phase making up the sample: It is lowest, though
still sizable, in the nanotube sample, increases for the sample with
intermediary 1D/2D mixed content, and is largest in the 2D nanomesh.
Indeed, the WS2 2D nanomesh has several symmetry-breaking
attributes that favor SHG: (i) It is made of mono- to three-layer
sheets, as confirmed by TEM images and location of excitonic features
in the reflectivity spectra, (ii) has considerable roughness arising
from the formation of 2D platelets spreading around the initial 1D
skeleton (as depicted in Figure 4a), and finally (iii) WS2, in particular,
benefits from the strong electric dipole established in the unit cell
and linked to strong spin–orbit interaction. It is known that
SHG is strongly enhanced in TMDs with an odd number of layers, where
the unit cell lacks inversion symmetry, and is strongest in the monolayer
limit,88 and for this reason, for nonlinear
optics applications, such materials are exfoliated by various methods
in order to then create stacks of isolated sheets.16,76 In the case of our WS2 2D nanomesh, the material grows
directly on the substrate as “exfoliated” sheets of
mono- or low number of layers, and large quantities within a high-density
film of several microns in thickness, hence favoring nonlinear optical
response.

Figure 8b also shows
that, while the Si reference response follows the expected quadratic
curve for the SHG power as a function of the fundamental excitation
power,89 this is not the case for the WS2 samples. All three WS2 samples (nanotubes, with
mixed 1D/2D content, and 2D nanomesh) deviate from the quadratic dependence,
and the deviation is strongest for the 2D nanomesh. This can be observed
visually, but is clearly reflected by the differing R2 values of the fit curves (see caption of Figure 8b). This power-dependent divergence
can be attributed to the onset of saturable absorption, which correlates
with an increasing presence of edge states90 induced by the finite lateral sizes/domains of 2D nanosheets that
form when the material progresses from a 1D form to full 2D content.

The very large values of SHG and promising saturable absorption
properties in these materials, in particular in the 2D nanomesh, together
with the ability to be grown on insulating, transparent substrates
(demonstrated here on SiO2) point toward promising nonlinear
optical applications, which will be the subject of future work.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the sequential
growth by CVD of
a wide range of nanostructured materials, ranging from 1D WO3–x suboxides to WS2 nanophases with tunable
1D to 2D content, by intentionally decoupling into two stages (first
stage, partial reduction; second stage, sulfurization) a reaction
from WO3 to WS2 in order to enhance and reveal
the role played by W suboxides in CVD growth of WS2. In
this process, we created WO2.92/WO2.92 morphologies,
such as nanowires and nanorods, grown in-plane (i.e., parallel to the substrate) or out-of-plane
of the substrate; the stoichiometry of these suboxides was found instrumental
in the subsequent creation of many WS2 polymorphs. We were,
thus, able to exploit a WO3–x–intermediate
route that is very versatile, in that it is able to create by relatively
simple tuning of the CVD growth process, and in a single process stream,
a rich variety of 2H-WS2 phases: a tunable class of materials,
ranging from nanotubes, to mixed 1D and 2D WS2 phases,
to an out-of-plane (of the substrate), pure WS2 2D nanomesh
with extended 2D few-layer crystallites; as well as in-plane (parallel
to the substrate), self-seeded 2D domains. Regarding the in-plane
2D WS2 films, our study showed that their growth can be
routed via WO3–x suboxides, a different route than via W oxi-sulfides
as previously demonstrated in conventional 2D growth. Moreover, their
growth proceeds via a “self-seeding and feeding”
mechanism from 1D WO2.92/WO2.92 nanorod precursors,
which may be able to take advantage of the positional and orientational
growth within the substrate that can be achieved in growth of such
1D precursors.

The CVD route enables the growth of microns-thick
WO3–x suboxide nanowire films and
WS2 phases
with tunable 1D/2D content directly on substrates, in an evolutionary
manner, and on areas of at least several cm2 (limited here
by the dimensions of our furnace). WO3–x suboxide nanowire films can find their own applications as
sensing materials. The morphological tunability of the WS2 phases can be exploited to tune their optoelectronic properties.
In the examples given here, the evolution from WS2 nanotubes
with WO3–x cores into a pure WS2 2D nanomesh phase results in changes in the optical absorption/reflection
spectra and can provide media with tunable effective refractive index.
All WS2 nanophases in the class have very strong nonlinear
optical properties, with the 2D nanomesh being extremely SHG active.
Films obtained by condensation of TMD suspensions or composites of
nanoscale TMD flakes with polymers have been suggested in other works
for nonlinear optical applications. The 2D nanomesh demonstrated here,
however, has a “ready-made” sheet-exfoliated morphology,
large overall effective thickness of the film, and ability to be grown
directly on optically compatible substrates (i.e., insulators and transparent, as opposed to metallic),
which are all important advantages in terms of ease of coupling with
optical systems and devices as well as improved material stability.

Methods
Synthesis of Nanophases
and Nanostructures
A home-built
setup involving a horizontal furnace with a temperature gradient (Supporting
Information, Figure S1) was used to first
produce a variety of W suboxide nanowires/nanorods (by partially reducing
WO3 to suboxides), stage 1, which were then sulfurized
for conversion to WS2 nanophases, stage 2.

Synthesis
of W Suboxide Nanowires and Nanorods (Stage 1)
This is a
low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) process. The geometrical configuration
of the furnace and position of boats with precursor materials are
shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1. Differences in process substrate position/temperature, discussed
in the main text, led to the formation of (i) long, out-of-plane nanowires,
(ii) clusters of short nanorods, and (iii) in-plane nanorods of suboxides,
as described below.

WO3–x nanowires/nanorods were synthesized on SiO2/Si (i.e., 300 nm thermal oxide), without any
catalysts. Typically, 60 mg tungsten(VI) oxide (99.998%, Alfa Aesar)
and 400 mg sulfur powder (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) were used as precursors.
The SiO2/Si substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone,
isopropanol (both HPLC grade), and deionized water, in sequence, prior
to loading them in the furnace. A rotary pump pumped the tube during
the whole process. Only argon (flow rate 150 sccm) was used for transporting
the WO3 and sulfur vapor to the Si/SiO2 substrates.
This LPCVD stage has two distinct periods: (i) An initial period where
just WO3 is sublimed (without S vapor being introduced
into the reactor), a set of typical conditions being 1030 °C,
at a pressure below 10–1 mbar, and for 20 min; followed
by (ii) a period where S is introduced and co-evaporated together
with the WO3 over 15 min, leading to partial reduction
of the WO3 vapor, and, then, its condensation on the substrate
as WO2.92 and WO2.9 nanostructures.

We
have verified in dedicated experiments that in the conditions
described in (i), WO3 is volatile during our LPCVD process.
After annealing (nonhydrated) WO3 powder for 45 min, its
weight decreased by two-thirds, while the remaining powder in the
furnace pocket was verified by XRD to still be entirely WO3 (i.e., did not undergo any unexpected
reduction) at the end of the annealing period. No nanowires were formed
on the SiO2/Si substrates after just this process.

Synthesis
of out-of-Plane WS2 Nanotubes, Mixed 1D
and 2D Phases, and 2D Nanomesh (Stage 2)
This is an atmospheric
pressure CVD (APCVD) process. Out-of-plane WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowires on SiO2/Si were heated in the 850–925
°C range, under atmospheric pressure in the furnace center, whereas
400 mg of sulfur powder (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) was heated upstream (about
40 cm) at 180 °C. Argon, at a flow rate of 100 sccm, was used
to transport the sulfur vapor to the nanowires on SiO2/Si
sample. The same furnace geometry as above was employed. For generating Figure 4, where the transition
between nanotube and 2D nanomesh phases was monitored, identical parts
of the same initial WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowire sample
were reacted at 850 °C in S environment (in the conditions described
above), each for an increasing amount of time (Δt) up to 3 h, to form the series described in the figure caption.

We have also verified (by a combination of SEM, TEM, and XRD) that
WO2.9 and WO2.92 are nonvolatile in the conditions
of our APCVD process by annealing the WO2.92/WO2.9 nanowires (supported by their SiO2/Si substrate) for
1 h just in an Ar atmosphere (i.e., without the presence of S) in APCVD conditions and over the same
temperature range at which the various WS2 phases were
obtained (as described above).

Synthesis of in-Plane,
2D WS2 Domains (Stage 2)
As-grown WO2.92/WO2.9 short nanorods on SiO2/Si were heated
in the 850–925 °C range in the
center of the furnace, under atmospheric pressure (i.e., in an APCVD process), while 400 mg of sulfur
powder (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) was heated upstream (about 40 cm) at 180
°C. Argon, at 100 sccm flow rate, was used to transport the sulfur
vapor to the nanorods on SiO2/Si sample. The same furnace
geometry as above was employed.

Structural Characterization
of Grown Nanophases and Nanostructures
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
WO3–x nanowires/nanorods and
WS2 nanomesh as grown on
their SiO2/Si substrates were characterized by XRD performed
on a BRUKER AXS D8 Advance instrument, equipped with a Vantec-1 detector,
and using CuKα radiation at λ = 1.5418 Å.

High-Resolution
Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and
Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED)
Complementary HRTEM
and SAED were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100Plus microscope operated
at 200 kV and using a bottom-mounted CCD camera. A drop of nanowires/nanotubes/nanomesh
suspension in ethanol was drop-cast onto a mesh TEM support grid.

Raman Spectroscopy
All nanostructures, as grown on
their SiO2/Si substrates—WO3–x nanowires/nanorods, WS2 nanomesh, and
in-plane, WS2 2D domains—were characterized by Raman
spectroscopy performed with a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope, using
532 nm excitation laser. Samples were illuminated through a 50×
objective lens (1.9 μm diameter spot size), at a laser power
of 0.7 mW, while spectra were acquired with an exposure time of 1
s and using 200 accumulations.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The nanostructured
samples, as grown on the SiO2/Si substrates, were observed
using a JEOL SEM6480LV microscope in secondary electrons (SE) mode
with acceleration voltages in the 5–15 kV range depending on
the penetration depth needed for the various morphologies.

Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties
Microscopy and Normal Incidence
Reflection Measurements
An Axioplan 2 microscope (ZEISS)
with a halogen lamp and a 100×
microscope objective was used, measurements being performed in bright-field
mode. Microscope color images were taken with an Axiocam 105 color
camera, while optical spectra were taken over the 400–950 nm
spectral range with an Ocean Optics QE Pro spectrometer, using an
integration time of 1 s and averaging over 10 scans. The spectra were
normalized with respect to the untreated silicon wafer.

Angle-Dependent
Linear Optical Characterization
A Fianium
SC400-2 2 W laser source with a 1064 nm output wavelength and 20 MHz
repetition rate and a 5 ps pulse spliced to an in-house fabricated
supercontinuum fiber91 capable of a 450–2400
nm spectral range was used. Two uncoated Glan-Laser polarizers were
used to control the power output and polarization of the incident
light. The reflected light from the sample was collected via a 200 μm diameter SMA fiber (0.22 NA) mounted on a fiber launch
stage and measured with an Ocean Optics QE Pro spectrometer over 450–950
nm, using an integration time of 300 ms and averaging over 10 scans.
An automated setup was used to determine the reflected light angle.
The spectra were normalized with respect to the untreated silicon
wafer.

Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) Measurements
A femtosecond
laser (MaiTai HP from Spectra Physics), tuned to a wavelength of 800
nm, provided the incident fundamental beam. The laser produced pulses
at a repetition rate of 80 MHz, which are approximately 100 fs long
in time with a bandwidth of 10 nm. Two crossed polarizers (Glan-Laser
calcite antireflection coated) controlled the laser power. An achromatic
half-waveplate ensured that the incident beam is P-polarized (horizontal
polarization). Two colored glass bandpass filters were used to reject
any spurious light at the second harmonic. An achromatic lens (focal
length 150 mm, antireflection coated) focused the beam onto the sample
at an incident angle of 45° relative to the sample. Another achromatic
lens (focal length 150 mm, antireflection coated) collimated the SHG
in reflection, while a colored bandpass filter rejected the fundamental
beam, leaving only the SHG. The signal beam was focused into a cooled
photomultiplier tube (PMT) using an antireflection-coated lens (focal
length 200 mm). The PMT produced current pulses, which were pre-amplified
and fed into a gated photon counter. The data point for each incident
power was the average of 20 measurements, where the counting duration
of each measurement was 5 s.
