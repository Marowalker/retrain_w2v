One
of the main hurdles in nanomedicine is the low stability of
drug–nanocarrier complexes as well as the drug delivery efficiency
in the region-of-interest. Here, we describe the use of the film-forming
protein hydrophobin HFBII to organize dodecanethiol-protected gold
nanoparticles (NPs) into well-defined supraparticles (SPs). The obtained
SPs are exceptionally stable in vivo and efficiently
encapsulate hydrophobic drug molecules. The HFBII film prevents massive
release of the encapsulated drug, which, instead, is activated by
selective SP disassembly triggered intracellularly by glutathione
reduction of the protein film. As a consequence, the therapeutic efficiency
of an encapsulated anticancer drug is highly enhanced (2 orders of
magnitude decrease in IC50). Biodistribution and pharmacokinetics
studies demonstrate the high stability of the loaded SPs in the bloodstream
and the selective release of the payloads once taken up in the tissues.
Overall, our results provide a rationale for the development of bioreducible
and multifunctional nanomedicines.

==== Body
In the last
decades the use
of nanosized objects has been extensively exploited for improving in vivo drug delivery.1 In fact,
encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs into nanocarriers has been proven
to increase their stability and circulating time in the blood as well
as reduce their unspecific toxicity and cell resistance.2 Toward reaching these goals, a myriad of nanotechnology-based
drug delivery systems has been deployed, comprising, among others,
liposomes, core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) of different nature,
and nanotubes.1,3,4 However,
nanocarrier-based delivery has not yet reached the hoped results in
clinics.5 One of the main hurdles is the
low stability of drug–nanocarrier complexes in the biological
environment, which often results in an undesired drug leakage in the
biological fluids, in particular in the bloodstream for intravenously
injected formulations. This often leads to two main side-effects:
on one side, the penetration of drugs in the brain, heart, or other
vital organs, and, on the other side, the rapid drug clearance from
the kidneys. In this context, the role of filter organs is extremely
important, such as the liver and the spleen, crucial to avoid systemic
toxicity through an efficient interaction of resident immunocompetent
cells.6

NPs can spontaneously assemble
in solution into well-defined larger
structures called supraparticles (SPs), which may serve as containers
for the transport and controlled release of therapeutic agents.7−9 SPs have recently gained particular interest for their use in medicine,
for example, to evaluate the onset, progression, and treatment of
various pathologies by enhancing both imaging and therapeutic performances
of drugs.10−14 In order to assemble NPs into SPs, various surface chemistries have
been exploited using surfactants, lipids, polymers, or proteins, which
drive the self-assembly in solution as a result of a subtle balance
of noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, Coulombic and
van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and solvophobic effect.9,15,16 However, programming hierarchical
structure into nanoscale components remains a formidable challenge
for nanoscientists.

Several SPs reported in the literature were
obtained through controlled
aggregation of water-soluble NPs with biomolecules.7,14,17 Formation of hybrid SPs composed of hydrophobic
NPs in aqueous solutions has also been obtained, exploiting the amphiphilic
nature of lipids,18−20 surfactants,21,22 and polymers.10,23,24 In this latter case, the assembly
is driven by the hydrophobic effect with formation of defined SPs
constituted of a core of assembled hydrophobic NPs coated by an amphiphilic
molecule. While lipid vesicles containing NP clusters generally need
purification procedures for obtaining homogeneous samples, polymers
and surfactants give uniform SPs through simple methodologies (high
yield and low cost),10,25,26 but often the constituents are poorly metabolized and promote immunological
responses.27 A promising alternative for
obtaining biocompatible SPs through simple preparation methods is
represented by the use of Janus proteins, that is, biomolecules endowed
with a confined highly hydrophobic patch. These biosurfactants may
act as template agents that spontaneously assemble hydrophobic NPs
in aqueous solutions forming well-defined SPs, which result to be
biocompatible and partially biodegradable.14

Hydrophobins are small fungal amphiphilic proteins with remarkable
surface activity.28 Hydrophobin HFBII,
obtained from Trichoderma reesei, forms rigid and
impermeable films at interfaces preventing the leakage of volatile
oils into water, even at high temperature.29 It has also been shown that HFBII films prevent immune recognition.30−32 Considering that HFBII may form a solid robust film on hydrophobic
NPs dispersed in water solution, we studied the self-assembly of dodecanethiol
(DT)-stabilized AuNPs into aqueous solutions in the presence of HFBII.
A class of SPs that showed low cytotoxicity and exceptional stability,
even in biological fluids, has been synthesized and characterized.
The obtained SPs not only efficiently encapsulated and protected hydrophobic
drug molecules by means of the HFBII film but also specifically released
their payload intracellularly by glutathione reduction of the protein
film. This selective mechanism of release has been demonstrated through
both in vitro and in vivo studies
indicating the suitability of the developed SPs s for future applications
in diagnosis and therapy.

Results
Supraparticle Self-Assembly
We have devised a strategy
to prepare water-dispersible and biocompatible SPs composed of a core
of hydrophobic DT-protected AuNPs (DT-AuNPs) confined by a HFBII shell
(see Figures 1 and S1). In fact, we exploited the surfactant properties
of HFBII33−35 to transfer and disperse DT-AuNPs from hydrophobic
solvents into aqueous solutions. Briefly, the optimized strategy consisted
of a one-pot procedure starting from a two-phase system, HFBII@water/DT-AuNP@chloroform,
which was first completely dried to form a hybrid film and subsequently
rehydrated with formation of the desired SPs (details in the methodology
section of the SI).

building blocks for SP self-assembly: yellow represents the AuNP and

schematic representation (right). Color code of the protein secondary
structure: red (β sheet) and green ribbon (α helix), while
the amino acids of the hydrophobic patch are depicted in blue. (c)
Self-assembly of DT-AuNPs into a SP is driven by the formation of
a HFBII film at the interface where the HFBII hydrophobin patch interacts
with the DT ligands on the AuNP surface.

Interfacial surface tension measurements confirmed the ability
of HFBII to decrease the energy both at the water/chloroform and water/DT-AuNP@chloroform
interfaces by formation of a protein film (Figure S2). Moreover, a kinetic study showed that, during the initial
two-phase step, formation of SPs in the aqueous solution was almost
immediate when the two phases came into contact and NP concentration
in the aqueous phase increased continuously (Figure S3). These findings suggest that SP formation is driven by
an emulsification process, and solvent droplets containing DT-AuNPs
are stabilized at the interface by the HFBII film. Successive removal
of the solvent did not alter the SP structure that kept the initial
arrangement upon rehydration (see preparation methodology below).

The structural characterization of the obtained SPs is reported
in Figure 2a–g.
TEM analysis showed the presence of spherical-like nanocontainers
with a mean diameter of around 30 nm filled with an assembly of DT-AuNPs
(Figure 2a,b). These
dispersions were studied by a multiangle dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis resulting in an averaged hydrodynamic diameter (⟨DH⟩) of 112 nm (Figure S4) and UV–vis spectroscopy showing a characteristic
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak centered at 520 nm
(Figure 2c,d). In Figure 2e the invariance
of DLS autocorrelation functions over two months indicates the high
colloidal stability of these dispersions. Colloidal stability (Figure 2f) was also evaluated
by DLS and zeta-potential (Z-pot) analyses as a function of the pH:
The formed SPs were dispersed in different buffer solutions at the
same ionic strength ranging from pH 4 to 8.

over a pH scan: Dependence of the Z-pot (top of the plot) and the
SP size (bottom of the plot) as a function of the pH of the buffer
used to disperse the SPs. Error bars represent the standard error
evaluated on six measurements.

The dispersions showed a decreased colloidal stability at
pH =
5 caused by a drop of the Z-pot close to 0 with a subsequent slight
agglomeration. This behavior is due to HFBII that at its pI (isoelectric
point), at pH = 5.2, is in its zwitterionic form with a net charge
close to 0.36 Overall, these data highlight
the high colloidal stability of the prepared SPs as well as their
good compatibility with physiologic pH, which is important for biomedical
purposes.

While TEM analysis did not highlight the presence
of the protein
coating due to the low contrast of the organic material, electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements enabled us to evaluate
the chemical composition of the hybrid system (Figure 3a). EELS pseudocolor images (Figures 3b–d) of the corresponding
TEM pictures revealed the distribution of nitrogen (red), carbon (green),
and gold elements on the SP surface (circled dark SPs in the N–C
overlaid picture). The good overlay of the EELS signals attributed
to the N and C elements emphasizes the protein shell around the self-assembled
DT-AuNPs. This was also confirmed by FTIR analysis that showed characteristic
peaks of the protein in the SP spectrum (Figure 3e). More information on the secondary structure
of HFBII in the layer surrounding the SPs was obtained by circular
dichroism (CD). CD spectra of the SP dispersions highlighted that
the formation of the HFBII film was accompanied by a change in the
secondary structure of the protein compared to pure HFBII, shown by
a decrease in intensity of the peak at 200 nm and appearance of an
absorption band at 225 nm (black curve in Figure 3f), as expected when the protein forms a
film at a hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface.37 Furthermore, the obtained SP dispersions could be lyophilized and
redispersed in water maintaining their initial morphology (Figure S5), thus offering the possibility to
be stored as powders rather than in solution. Storage of biomedical
formulations as powder is generally preferred, as in this form they
are better preserved and for longer time.38

Supraparticle as Nanocontainers: Behavior in Biological Fluids
The possibility of using these SPs as potential biomedical nanocontainers
depends on their colloidal stability and ability to encapsulate and
release hydrophobic molecules in physiological conditions as well
as in biological fluids. In order to prove SP colloidal stability
in biological fluids, we prepared SP dispersions in cell culture media
(DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and in plasma obtained
from healthy mice. These dispersions were stable at DLS analysis for
over 96 hours (h) at 37 °C (Figure S6). TEM analysis of the same samples indicated that the SP structure
was preserved also after incubation in the biological milieu (Figure S6).

Having obtained a stable single
nano-object that could simultaneously bear a high amount of Au (potential
diagnostic purpose) and an extended confined hydrophobic environment,
we next aimed at effectively encapsulating hydrophobic cargo molecules.
Thus, we initially encapsulated the hydrophobic fluorescent dye Nile
Red (NR) in the core of the SPs (SP@NR, scheme in Figure 4a). FTIR and UV–vis
analysis of SP@NR showed the successful encapsulation of the dye (Figure S7), while DLS indicated that the size
was similar to that of the unloaded SPs. It is known that proximity
of the dye with the AuNPs induces a fluorescence quenching on NR emission,39 thus this effect was used to monitor the release
of the dye as increase in fluorescence (Figures 4c–h and S8). Initially, we studied the release of NR from SP@NR through dialysis versus a 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution over
8 days.40 The presence of BSA should guarantee
a better solubility of the NR and mimic the biological environment.

to encapsulate and release hydrophobic cargo molecules.
(a) Chemical structures of DT chains and encapsulated fluorescent
molecule NR. Carbon atoms are represented in gray, nitrogen in blue,
oxygen in red, and sulfur in yellow. (b) Schematic sketch of the mechanism
to detect the release of the fluorescent cargo molecules from the
SP in biological fluids: Encapsulation of NR leads to quenching (SP@NRQ)
of its fluorescence. In the presence of biological fluids, the potential
partition of NR from the SP (SP@NRF) to the surrounding environment
leads to a restoration of NR fluorescence that can be monitored. (c) In vitro release experiments in sink conditions. NR-loaded
SPs were dialyzed versus 2% (w/V) BSA solution over
time. The release profile was obtained by measuring NR fluorescence
(λEx = 535 nm, λEm = 630 nm and
fit by a Peppas release model (red line). (d) Representative measurements
of NR release dynamics in FBS by fluorescence experiments. The normalized
(Norm) NR fluorescence represents the amount of NR still associated
with SPs after incubation in 10% FBS (red circles), 55% FBS (blue
circles), water (black circles), or ethanol (yellow circles), respectively.
Release kinetics data were fit by a two-compartment model (black and
red solid lines). (e) Temperature dependence of the NR release in
10% FBS. (f) Scheme showing the release of NR in response to SP incubation
with GSH and corresponding change of the fluorescence properties of
the SP dispersions. (g) Color evaluation of SP@NRQ dispersions upon
incubation with GSH (SP@NRF). The cuvette was illuminated under an
UV lamp (λEx = 340 nm). (h) The % increase of NR
fluorescence signal of a SP@NRQ dispersion incubated with GSH with
respect to the control SP@NRQ incubated in GSH free medium.

We observed a slow NR release
profile as shown in Figure 4c, which could be fit by a
Peppas model41 and resulted in a non-Fickian
diffusion mechanism (super case II transport) with a t1/2 = 194 h (details reported in Table S1). The most striking result was that after 8 days, about
50% of dye was still retained in the SPs. To strengthen these results
and demonstrate the efficiency of the developed system as carrier
of hydrophobic cargoes, a time-scan fluorescence measurement of the
SP@NR overnight was performed in different environments: water, 10%
FBS, and 55% FBS at both 25 and 37 °C (Figures 4d,e). While almost no loss of NR was observed
after 18 h in water, as expected, the presence of proteins in solution
promoted NR release.6 The curves were analyzed
with a two-compartment decay model6 resulting
in a remaining NR cargo of about 60% and 35% of the initial value
after 18 h in 10% and 55% FBS, respectively (details in Table S2 and in the SI). The temperature did not show major effects on the release. These
results indicated that loaded SPs have an exceptional efficiency in
retaining hydrophobic cargoes in biological milieus if compared to
other nanocarriers.6,42,43 It is likely that the HFBII impermeable and rigid film coating the
SPs is responsible for the delayed release of the encapsulated molecules.

Intrigued by the possibility to trigger the sudden release of the
drug cargo in vivo by disrupting the HFBII film,
we studied the stability of the SPs in reducing environment. In fact,
because the SP bionano interface mostly formed by HFBII film (only
a tiny protein corona formed in serum, data not shown), the reducing
intracellular environment could strongly affect its integrity. In
particular, glutathione (GSH)44,45 (intracellular concentration
5–10 mM) reduces the internal disulfide bridges of HFBII, thus
changing its secondary structure (Figure S9) and most probably affecting its film-forming ability.

Empty
SPs were incubated in a solution of BSA (10 mg/mL) with increasing
GSH concentrations in a range comparable to its intracellular values
and monitored by UV–vis over time. The GSH threshold activation
concentration at which SP disassembly starts is between 0.5 and 1.0
mM, as demonstrated by the sharp decrease of the plasmon intensity
and appearance of a precipitate in the SP aqueous dispersion. The
color of these dispersions significantly changed (Figure S10) from purple to light gray with formation of a
dark precipitate (uncoated DT-AuNPs). UV–vis and DLS analyses
of the SP aqueous dispersion incubated with GSH showed the disappearance
of the plasmon peak and formation of aggregates, respectively (Figure S9). These results are explained by a
progressive dismantling of the HFBII film with loss of stability of
the SPs and exposure of their hydrophobic content (DT-AuNPs) into
the aqueous solution, which led to aggregation and precipitation of
the so-formed AuNP aggregates (Figure S11). This mechanism, taking place also in a biological milieu, may
potentially occur in vivo, endowing these SPs with
an intrinsic and selective intracellular degradation pathway.

Moreover, an additional evidence was obtained incubating SP@NR
at 37 °C with 10 mg/mL of BSA in the presence of 5 mM GSH (above
the threshold) along a kinetic time course. Fluorescence emission
experiments showed that samples treated with GSH (also displaying
a different color with respect to the untreated samples) were characterized
by an increased fluorescence emission linked to an augmented release
of NR. This was also confirmed with stability studies by incubating
the SPs with 3 mM GSH at 37 °C for 24 h.

Pharmacological and Pharmacokinetic
Properties of the SPs in in Vitro and in
Vivo Conditions
The biocompatibility of the empty
SPs was evaluated by measuring
the possible toxicity in five different cell lines (human cervical
adenocarcinoma HeLa, human osteosarcoma MG-63, human glioblastoma
U-87 MG, triple negative human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231, and
triple negative murine breast adenocarcinoma 4T1) as a function of
the SP concentration. No relevant alteration of the viability was
observed in all cell lines (>80%) (Figures 5a and S12). Confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) experiments on HeLa cells treated
with the highest concentration used in the cytotoxicity experiments
revealed that SPs were internalized in the cell cytoplasm (Figure 5b,c). In particular,
the SP appeared localized within vesicular structures accumulating
in the perinuclear region consistently with their recruitment into
endolysosomal structures (Figure 5b,c).43 SP uptake in HeLa
cells was evaluated by ICP-AES as internalized Au content and 24 h
incubation resulted in 10% of the administered SP dose taken up by
the cells (inset in Figure 5c). Cellular uptake of loaded SPs with the hydrophobic fluorophore
Bodipy (SP@Bodipy, Figures S13–S14 for their characterization and release kinetics upon incubation
with GSH) was evaluated in HeLa cells as fluorescence emission of
the encapsulated dye as well (Figures S12–S13). In particular, HeLa cells incubated with SP@Bodipy for 24 h (Figure 5d,e) showed both
intracellular internalization of the dye in the perinuclear region
and a blurry cytosolic localization. While a dotted-like perinuclear
pattern is generally consistent, as seen above, with encapsulation
inside the endosomes, a cytosolic homogeneous fluorescence usually
appears when the dye is already released from the SPs.

Figure 5 In vitro biological behavior of the SP aqueous
dispersions. (a) MTT cell viability test performed incubating different
cell lines with increasing concentration of SPs over a time course
of 24 h. Untreated cells were used as control. Experiments were carried
out in DMEM with 10% FBS in triplicates. The SP concentration tested
in terms of mg of Au/L were: 10.82, 5.46, 2.73, 1.08, 0.11, and 0.01
mg/L. (b) Evaluation of SP uptake by HeLa: 450,000 HeLa cells have
been challenged with 3.8 × 1010 SPs for 24 h and imaged
by CLSM. Cells were stained for cell membrane (Cell Mask) and nucleus
(DAPI), while SP were imaged through their scattering properties (reflection).
Red arrows indicate the presence of SPs localized in a perinuclear
region inside the cell. (c) Orthogonal representation of SP uptake
by HeLa cells imaged as describe in (b). The inset reports the SP
uptake quantification by ICP-AES in terms of gold content associated
with the treated cells. The standard error is calculated on three
different replicates. Scale bars are 15 μm. (d) Evaluation of
Bodipy-loaded SP uptake in HeLa cells. Cells were stained and imaged
as described in (b), and Bodipy was imaged in the far-red channel.
Scale bars are 20 μm. (e) Single cell confocal microscopy and
orthogonal representation of a HeLa cell treated with Bodipy-loaded
SP. Scale bar is 20 μm.

To validate this hypothesis, we performed experiments by
administering
to the cells Bodipy solutions in DMSO. In this case, CLSM analysis
reported a different intracellular localization of the free fluorophore
that, upon crossing the cell membrane by passive diffusion, seemed
to be homogeneously localized in the cytosolic compartment (see Figure S15). To better elucidate the release
mechanism of the dye from SP@Bodipy, we used HEK293-GFP cell lines
stably expressing a cytosolic form of the green fluorescent protein
(GFP, Figure S16). These cells were incubated
with SP@Bodipy for 24 h and fluorescence microscopy analysis of the
sample highlighted a partial intracellular release of the dye as appearance
of yellow areas inside the cells due to colocalization of the GFP
with free Bodipy signals. However, red-dotted areas due to the presence
of SP@Bodipy were also present in the perinuclear region, indicating
a delayed and prolonged release of the fluorophore over time.

Having demonstrated the ability of the loaded SPs to intracellularly
deliver hydrophobic cargoes, we prepared and characterized SPs containing
a prototypic hydrophobic anticancer drug, paclitaxel (PTX) (SP@PTX)
(Figure S13). SP@PTX release kinetics in
BSA solutions, also in the presence of GSH, were measured and resembled
the behavior displayed by those containing the fluorescent cargoes
(Figure S13). The possible cytotoxic effects
of the SP@PTX were investigated with respect to the free drug on PTX-sensitive
(Hela, MDA-MD231) and PTX-resistant (4T1) cancer cells.46,47 Encapsulation of the PTX in the SPs resulted in 1 or 2 orders of
magnitude reduction of the drug IC50 with respect to the
free drug (Figures 6a–d and S10–14). Moreover,
due to the progressive drug release from the SP core, we observed
a clear time-dependent effect of the PTX only when loaded in SPs (Figure S18).

drug molecule PTX encapsulated
in the SPs. (a) Dose–response cytotoxic effect evaluated through
an MTT assay on MDA cells incubated with PTX-loaded SPs (SP@PTX) and

replicates. (b) SP@PTX and PTX IC50 as evaluated from experiments

experimental replicates. (d) SP@PTX and PTX IC50 as evaluated

The assessment of the interaction between tumor cells and
the developed
SPs is essential for their application as diagnostic or therapeutic
tools. However, in vitro efficacy is not sufficient
to prove the in vivo effectiveness of a nanocarrier,
as to exert its pharmacological activity, the nanocarrier has to be
stable in the in vivo biological environment before
reaching the pathological target.6

In the perspective of using these SPs for biomedical applications
either as diagnostic or therapeutic tools, longitudinal analyses of
both in vivo biodistribution (using SP@Bodipy) and
pharmacokinetics (using SP@PTX) were performed in healthy mice after
intravenous (iv) administration. First, the fate of SP@Bodipy, both
considering gold and loaded dye, was evaluated through in
vivo and ex vivo studies (Figures 7). Figure 7a shows serial scans of the same mouse treated
with SP@Bodipy at different time-points. Very interestingly, a progressive
increase of the signal was observed. This is apparently in contrast
with the largest part of the experiments of optical imaging performed
with fluorescent dyes, in which clearance and excretion lead to a
time-dependent reduction of the signal. Here, considering that gold
has a quenching effect on the emission of the dye (as demonstrated
in the previous in vitro experiments), the initial
increase in fluorescence (24 h) is interpreted as due to the disassembling
of the SP@Bodipy supraparticles once they have reached the organs
and penetrated into the cells. Moreover, dissociation between gold
(carrier) and Bodipy (cargo) is mainly associated with the abdominal
region until 24 h after the treatment, and at the 96 h, it spreads
in different regions, including lymph nodes and thoracic and pelvic
areas. The actual migration of the SP@Bodipy in filter organs is demonstrated
by comparing Figure 7b,c. In Figure 7b
representative images of liver sections stained with the nuclear markers
Hoechst 33258 (blue) are reported. The upper panel depicts a progressive
increase of Bodipy (red staining) in these sections until 24 h after
the treatment, followed by a decrease at the last time point. This
trend is in agreement with in vivo optical imaging
and furthermore confirms the hypothesis of a disassembling of the
adduct gold-dye inside the organ. Higher magnified pictures of the
liver parenchyma at 4 and 96 h after treatment, respectively, are
reported in the lower panel of Figure 7b. The presence of red staining around the nuclei was
observed at both time points, suggesting that an active internalization
inside the cells is required to detect Bodipy fluorescent signal.
The main difference is the anatomical localization of the dye; in
the liver of the mouse sacrificed 4 h after the treatment, it is almost
homogeneously diffused, whereas 96 h after the administration, it
is confined in ramified and polarized cells with smaller nuclei that
very likely belong to the Kupffer cells. The accumulation of gold
in the Kupffer cells, investigated through histological analysis by
autometallography (AMG) (Figure 7c, lower panel, right) strongly suggests that intact
SP@Bodipy enters in the cells and then disassembles, allowing the
release of the dye and consequently the detection of fluorescence. Figure 7c, upper panels,
shows the kinetics of gold accumulation in liver (black spots) in
full agreement with the fluorescent trend: The highest level of the
signal is after 24 h with a progressive reduction over time. Moreover,
gold accumulation was not homogeneously spread in the whole parenchyma,
but it seemed more localized in thin and ramified cells (most probably
macrophages and Kupffer cells). Overall, in vitro and in vivo results obtained using SP@Bodipy suggest
that (1) the cargo is efficiently retained into the carrier until
its cellular internalization and (2) the presence of a reducing environment
(GSH) intracellularly induces disassembly of the complex. Further
experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
of NP@PTX in comparison with the classical cremophor-based formulation
of PTX in terms of release and biodistribution.

Figure 7 (a) In vivo biodistribution of SP@Bodipy after
iv administration in the same mouse. The fluorescence signal intensity,
measured as normalized photon counts (NC), is shown as a pseudocolor
scale bar. The scale bar is consistent for all images. (b) Liver sections
from untreated and SP@Bodipy-treated mice sacrificed 4, 24, 96 h,
respectively. In blue, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258,
and in red, the signal is associated with Bodipy. (C) Liver sections
from untreated and SP@Bodipy-treated mice sacrificed 4, 24, 96 h,
respectively. Black spots are representative of the gold accumulation
revealed by silver lactate, and the parenchyma was revealed by Safranin
O staining.

Figure 8a shows
the pharmacokinetic profile of PTX in plasma of mice receiving 20
mg/kg either freely injected in cremophor or loaded into the SPs.
The levels of the drug in the bloodstream of the animals treated with
SP@PTX were markedly lower than the other group and rapidly decreased
disappearing 4 h after administration. This difference could be due
to a rapid distribution of the SP@PTX into the main filter organs.
In fact, the levels of PTX recovered in the liver were higher after
the administration of SP@PTX than cremophor-PTX (Figure 8d). The rapid and strong tropism
to the filter organs is furthermore demonstrated by the increase of
splenic and pulmonary levels of PTX in the group treated with SPs
(Figure S19). This result confirms that
the low amount of PTX and gold in the plasma is mainly due to a rapid
sequestration of the SPs. To assess that this sequestration was actually
related to an active penetration of the SPs in the liver parenchyma,
ICP-MS measurements were carried out in the same mice, and the trend
of PTX and gold SPs was comparable at different time-points (Figures 8e-f). Similarly
to what we found for the liver, the curves of the kinetics of gold
and drug in plasma showed a similar profile, strongly suggesting a
stable association between PTX and the gold carrier after administration
in the systemic circulation.

Figure 8 Levels of PTX in (a) plasma and (d) liver measured
by HPLC after
iv treatment with free PTX or SP@PTX in healthy mice. Levels of gold
in (b) plasma and (e) liver measured by ICP-MS after SP@PTX injection.
Each group has three mice as replicates. Data are expressed as mean
± SE. Two way-ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posthoc test was carried
out. Multiple comparisons (matching both treatments and time points)
show a significant difference in kinetics and biodistribution of the
two formulations. Trend of levels of both gold and PTX in (c) plasma
and (f) liver derived from mice treated with SP@PTX. The values were
normalized to 1 at the first time point (10 min).

Even if a single administration of 20 mg/kg of PTX alone
is normally
well tolerated, we could not exclude an additive effect played by
gold accumulation. To evaluate histopathological alterations, representative
H&E-stained sections from spleen, liver, and lungs of animals
sacrificed 96 h after treatment with PTX and SP@PTX were compared
to those of untreated mice (Figure S20).
Our data did neither reveal any macroscopic modification of parenchyma
nor features of inflammation and necrosis. As in the case of SP@Bodipy, in vivo studies suggest that SP@PTX supraparticles are stable in vivo, accumulate in filter organs, and are able to release
their cargo once penetrated into the cells.

Discussion
We have developed a facile and efficient methodology, which exploits
HFBII surfactant and film-forming properties, to assemble hydrophobic
AuNPs into water-stable and biocompatible SPs stable in the biological
environment. These water-dispersible SPs possess an extended inner
hydrophobic compartment that can be exploited for drug loading. This
highly hydrophobic core matches the physicochemical properties (such
as hydrophobicity and solvent miscibility) of most conventional chemotherapeutics
and is able to avoid the release of hydrophobic drugs in the systemic
circulation before reaching tissue parenchyma.6,48 In
fact, the importance of the cargo-carrier compatibility for reducing
undesired release of poorly soluble drugs has been recently demonstrated
for polymeric PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
NPs in vivo.6,42 Similarly, our release
experiments on the developed SPs demonstrated a high ability to retain
the cargoes inside the carrier in biological fluids, which represents
one of the main hurdles on the targeted delivery of nanodrugs. On
the other hand, a sudden release of the drug upon SP uptake by the
cells is triggered by the reducing action of the intracellular GSH,
which promotes breakage of the HFBII coating. As a consequence, an
encapsulated anticancer drug, SP@PTX, showed 2 orders of magnitude
decrease of its IC50 in in vitro experiments
on target cells. Through an elegant and original approach combining in vivo tracking of the SPs with either a fluorescent dye
or a drug, we were able to demonstrate the working hypotheses postulated
above. In particular, this study highlights the reliability of the
developed system for its intracellular delivery with minimal dispersion
of the payload. Although other steps, such as the functionalization
of the surface to pass through biological barriers and/or to reach
specific targets will have to be considered, we believe that the demonstration
of this general behavior may represent a robust starting point to
think about a next generation of nanocarriers. The obtained SP represents
a theranostic nanosystem able to simultaneously carry high content
of AuNPs and drugs,30 but also, by means
of the impermeable HFBII coating, prevents leakage of the drug.31,32 AuNPs were chosen for their easy preparation49 and bioinertness,49,50 along with the possibility
to use the high content of Au in the SP core as diagnostic and therapeutic
tool (in fact, gold provides nearly 3-fold greater X-ray attenuation
per unit weight than iodine) in computed tomography and radiation
therapy10,51,52 applications.
The applicability of the developed methodology is general and may
be applied to the obtainment of a broad variety of new SPs, for example,
fluorinated ones. Furthermore, the possibility to modify chemically
or genetically, that is, fusion proteins,53 the HFBII shell allows for further functionalization of the SP surface
for targeting specific tissues. Overall, these results are important
for guiding advances in the design of multistage and multimodal nanosystems
for diagnosis and therapy.

Methods
Procedure to
Prepare the HFBII-Stabilized SPs
900 μL
of DT-AuNP (stock concentration about 1–3 × 1015 NPs/mL) were precipitated using ethanol (≅10 mL) and centrifuged
at 8000 rpm for 30 min. The obtained pellet was dried using compressed
air, resuspended in 900 μL of chloroform and moved in a round
bottomed flask. HFBII was obtained as described in reference.54 A fresh solution of HFBII 0.1 mg/mL was prepared
by dissolving an accurately weighed amount of the protein in Milli-Q
water (mQw) under sonication for 15 min using a bath. NP dispersion
was then placed in a water bath at 50 °C and stirred magnetically
(>300 rpm). The freshly prepared HFBII solution was added dropwise
to the NP dispersion and subsequently the NP/HFB biphasic solution
was left under magnetic stirring at 50 °C for 1 h. During stirring
CHCl3 and aqueous phases were vigorously mixed and the
aqueous phase gradually turned pink, as a consequence of NP transfer
into the aqueous phase via SPs formation. The sample was subsequently
dried using rotavapor. Evaporation was gradually performed at room
temperature leading to the formation of a dried film. The dried film
was dissolved in mQw (10 mL) and subject of ultrasound bath for 15
min. The obtained SP dispersion was left overnight at RT and dialyzed
against mQw for 24 h.

Three 1 min-tip-sonication cycles were
performed on the dialyzed sample using a SONIC Vibracell (Newtown,
CT) operating at 20 V and set at 80% power. For dye and drug encapsulation,
the molecule to be encapsulated was dissolved in 200 μL of the
organic phase (CHCl3) and incubated overnight with 800
μL of the NP dispersion. After that the encapsulation of the
drug and the NPs to form SPs was accomplished following the same procedure
explained above to prepare empty SPs. The purification of the drug
loaded SPs was performed by centrifugation: first centrifugation run
(speed 1000 g for 20 min); second centrifugation run (5000 g for 40
min); third centrifugation run (5000 g for 40 min). At each purification
step the obtained supernatant was collected and analyzed by FTIR and
UV–vis to disclose the presence of free HFBII or drug molecule,
while the pellet was suspended in Milli-Q water and processed again.
In a typical purification process three runs are sufficient to remove
the excess free drug in solution. SP number was evaluated as it follows:
the volume of a SP with a radius 15 nm is VSP =  while the weight
of a SP is obtained approximately
multiplying its volume to the density of gold (19 g/cm3). The SP concentration was then obtained by dividing the gold content
of the SP preparation as measured by ICP-AES to the approximate weight
of a SP.

In vitro drug release characterization
To measure the release pattern of Nile Red from the SP@NR, 2.5 mL
of SP@NR were placed into a dialysis bag (MWCO: 3000 Da), which was
subsequently immersed in 25 mL of aqueous media containing 2% (w/v)
BSA at 25 °C under gently stirring. At predetermined time intervals,
1 mL of the equilibrated solution was recovered and the NR content
was determined by fluorescence measurement using an excitation of
535 nm and measuring the emission at 630 nm. The excitation and emission
width were fixed at 5 nm while the sensitivity of the Fluorimeter
(Jasco) was set on high. In order to maintain the sink conditions,
each mL of solution recovered was replenished with a fresh one. To
evaluate the amount of NR release a calibration curve was used. The
drug release data obtained were fitted to a Peppas model using SigmaPlot.

In vivo experiments
Mice were maintained
under specific pathogen-free condition in the Institute’s Animal
Care Facility and regularly checked by a certified veterinarian. Food
and water were available for ad libitum consumption. Artificial light
was provided in a 12h/12h cycle. Procedures involving
animals and their care were conducted in conformity with institutional
guidelines in compliance with national (Legislative Decree n. 26,
March 4, 2014; Authorization n.19/2008-A issued March 6, 2008, by
the Italian Ministry of Health) and international laws and policies
(EEC Council Directive 2010/63, August 6, 2013; Standards for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, U.S. National Research Council,
Statement of Compliance A5023–01, October 28, 2008).

Four-week-old female BALB/c mice (CDI envigo) were enrolled for biodistribution
and pharmacokinetics study. Regarding biodistribution, four animals
were intravenously treated with 200 μL of SP@Bodipy (1 ×
1012 SPs/mL). Optical imaging was conducted on animals
before and at 4, 24, and 96 h after SPs injection using the Explore
Optix System (ART, Advanced Research Technologies, Montreal, Canada),
as already described by our group.55 Selected
region of interest (ROI) scan (ventral area) was performed with a
step size of 2 mm. After in vivo imaging, mice were
sacrificed by decapitation, and the liver was collected and immediately
frozen for histological analysis to visualize both Bodipy and gold
accumulation.

As regards pharmacokinetics, animals were treated
with 20 mg/kg
of cremophor PTX (n = 15) or SP@PTX (n = 15). Blood was collected, in heparinized tubes, 10 min, 1, 4,
8, and 24 h after treatment and centrifuged to obtain plasma. After
mice sacrifice, liver, spleen, and lungs were collected and stored
at −20 °C until ICP-MS analysis (to detect the presence
of gold) and HPLC-UV (to measure the levels of PTX). Elemental analysis
of organs was carried out by ICP-MS as described before (methods in
the SI) to evaluate the Au content. To
measure its concentration, each organ was weighed before the analysis.
The total concentration of PTX in the different biological matrices
was determined by HPLC as previously described.56 For the determination of PTX in tissues and organs, they
were previously homogenized in 0.2 M CH3COONH4 pH 4.5.

Each study sample (0.3 mL for plasma and 0.5 mL for
homogenate
tissues) was assayed together with a five points of standard calibration
curve prepared in the corresponding control biological matrix obtained
from untreated mice at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 5 μg/sample.
The limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.16 μg/mL and 0.6 μg/g
for plasma and organs, respectively

Histological Studies
Histological analyses were performed
on sections derived from mice treated with SP@Bodipy. Fluorescent
analysis was performed incubating liver cryostatic sections (30 μm
of thickness) with the vital nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (2 μg/mL
in PBS) and then acquired by Olympus Fluoview microscope BX61 (Tokyo,
Japan) with confocal system FV500 equipped by specific lasers λexc = 405 nm for Hoechst 33258 and λexc =
635 nm to visualize the specific signal associated with Bodipy.

Liver micrometric sections (4 μm) were cut to analyze the metal
tissue distribution, and autometallography staining was carried out
by as recently described. At the end of the staining, sections were
visualized through a light microscope for the identification and localization
of gold aggregates, visible as black granular pigments.57
