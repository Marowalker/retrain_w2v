Carrier
multiplication is a process in which one absorbed photon
excites two or more electrons. This is of great promise to increase
the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Until now, the factors that
determine the onset energy of carrier multiplication have not been
convincingly explained. We show experimentally that the onset of carrier
multiplication in lead chalcogenide quantum confined and bulk crystals
is due to asymmetric optical transitions. In such transitions most
of the photon energy in excess of the band gap is given to either
the hole or the electron. The results are confirmed and explained
by theoretical tight-binding calculations of the competition between
impact ionization and carrier cooling. These results are a large step
forward in understanding carrier multiplication and allow for a screening
of materials with an onset of carrier multiplication close to twice
the band gap energy. Such materials are of great interest for development
of highly efficient photovoltaic devices.

==== Body
For solar
cells, semiconductor
quantum dots (QDs) are of interest due to inexpensive and facile synthesis
and processing procedures using wet chemistry as well as desirable
optical properties such as a size-tunable band gap, photostability,
and the occurrence of efficient carrier multiplication (CM).1−5 In the latter process, absorption of a single, high-energy photon
leads to the creation of two or more electron–hole pairs. The
onset of CM, which is the lowest photon energy for which CM occurs,
is the most important aspect for enhancement of the photovoltaic efficiency
in solar cells.6 Ideally, this onset is
at twice the band gap energy, limited only by energy conservation.
In practice, the onset of CM is higher and depends on the size, shape,
and composition of the material.7 Significant
research effort has been devoted to reducing the onset of CM by tuning
these parameters.8−12 The origin of the onset is however poorly understood, crippling
the search for materials and structures with a lower onset of CM.

CM in lead chalcogenide (PbX, X = S, Se, Te) crystals is usually
described in terms of a competition between impact ionization (II),
the process in which a hot electron excites a second electron over
the band gap, and other cooling channels.13−17 These other cooling channels include emission of
bulk-like PbX phonons, emission of surface related phonons, excitation
of surface ligand vibrations, and trapping to surface states.18−26 Typically only the highest valence and lowest conduction bands are
considered. In our earlier work we have however shown that additional
bands are important for absorption of high-energy photons and cooling
of hot charge carriers in PbS and PbSe QDs.27−29 At high photon
energy where CM occurs, one should therefore take the entire band
structure into account.

Here, we show that asymmetric optical
transitions involving higher
valence and conduction bands determine the onset of CM in PbX quantum
confined and bulk crystals. Using tight-binding calculations we show
that the asymmetric distribution of photon excess energy between the
electron and hole explains the onset of CM. The asymmetric distribution
is due to excitation of electronic states associated with the highest
valence band to the second lowest conduction band or from the second
highest valence band to the lowest conduction band. These processes
are different from excitations in which the photon energy is distributed
asymmetrically between charge carriers due to a large difference in
effective masses (such as in InAs)30 of
the highest valence band and lowest conduction band, since higher
bands are involved that can possibly lead to slower cooling or higher
II rates. With this insight, the search for a material suitable to
exploit CM can be directed at semiconductors with strong asymmetric
optical transitions involving higher bands at two times the band gap
energy.

Results and Discussion
We have synthesized colloidal
PbS and PbSe QDs of various sizes
following the procedures of Cademartiri et al.31 modified by Moreels et al.32 and Steckel et al.33 The size of the QDs was tuned by variation of
the reaction time after injection of sulfur or selenium. The CM yield
as a function of photon energy was measured using transient absorption
(TA) spectroscopy with pump and probe laser pulses of 180 fs duration,
as described previously.27−29 The QD samples were stirred to
prevent photocharging.34 In Figure 1a we show a typical hyperspectral
TA image for 4.8 nm PbSe QDs with a band gap of 0.82 eV (1520 nm),
photoexcited at 3.5 eV (350 nm). The image shows the change in absorption
resulting from photoexcitation as a function of pump–probe
delay time and probe wavelength. Initially hot charge carriers are
created by absorption of photons with energy larger than the band
gap. Subsequently they cool down through II or other cooling channels.
Time averaged spectra at various delay times are shown in Figure 1b, where we highlight
three spectral features paramount to this work.

Figure 1 (a) Hyperspectral TA
image for 4.8 nm PbSe QDs photoexcited at
3.5 eV (350 nm). (b) Time averaged spectra at 5–10 ps and 0.5–2
ns pump–probe delay, before and after Auger decay has taken
place. The spectral features labeled 1–3 are discussed in the
text.

At 5–10 ps pump–probe
delay the hot charge carriers
have cooled down to the band edge. Feature (1) in Figure 1b is the band edge bleach resulting
from reduced ground-state absorption and stimulated emission due to
the presence of band edge excitons. This bleach signal scales with
the number of band edge excitons and is used to determine the CM yield.35−37 The band edge bleach is reduced at 0.5–2 ns pump–probe
delay, since Auger decay of multiple excitons has taken place, leaving
at most a single cold exciton in each QD. Feature (2) in Figure 1b is a shift of the
Σ5–6 transition,27 while feature (3) in Figure 1b results from a bleach and shift of the high-energy L4–6 and L5–7 transitions.28 These transitions are important when considering
absorption of high-energy photons and cooling of hot charge carriers.
They should therefore be included in a discussion of CM. The Σ5–6, L4–6 and L5–7 transitions are indicated in the bulk band structure of PbSe and
PbS in Figure 2a and 2b, with the bands involved numbered 4–7.

band gap are numbered 4–7 and the Σ5–6, L4–6, and L5–7 transitions
are indicated.

Determination of the
CM characteristics in PbX QDs from transient
absorption spectra is well-established and described in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).35−37 The quantum yield (QY) is defined as the number of electron–hole
pairs generated per absorbed photon. The QY data for PbSe and PbS
QDs are shown in Figure 3a and 3b and in Figures S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information, as a function of photon
energy normalized by the band gap. For high photon energies, the QY
exceeds unity, due to the occurrence of CM. Within the error margin,
the results agree well with the measurements of Ellingson et al.36 and McGuire et al.34 Following previous studies,
we determine the CM threshold and CM efficiency from a linear fit
to the QY data exceeding unity.12,38,39 The energy at which this fit gives a QY equal to 1 is taken as the
threshold of CM, while the slope of the line is the CM efficiency.
Hence, the CM efficiency is the number of electron–hole pairs
produced per unit normalized photon energy above the threshold. Note
that the CM efficiency defined in this way is a simplification, since
the QY does not necessarily increase linearly with photon energy,
as we discuss below. We choose not to fit the model of Beard et al.15 to our data, since it
does not take into account any bands higher than those at the band
edge, while we show here that higher bands determine the CM threshold.
To study the relation between the Σ5–6, L4–6, and L5–7 transitions from Figure 2 and CM, their transition
energies and the CM threshold are plotted versus the
band gap energy, Ebg, in Figure 3 for PbSe (d) and PbS (d) quantum
confined and bulk crystals.

Figure 3 (a and b) QY as a function of photon energy
normalized by the band
gap energy for various sizes of PbSe and PbS QDs. (c and d) Normalized
Σ5–6, L4–6, and L5–7 transition energies and the CM threshold as a function of band gap
energy for PbSe and PbS quantum confined and bulk crystals. Bulk data
were taken from the work of Pijpers et al.40

From Figure 3a and 3b we observe that the dependence of
the QY on normalized
photon energy varies with the size of the QDs, showing an increase
in CM threshold and efficiency with increasing QD size. The results
are comparable for PbSe and PbS QDs. The latter is not surprising,
since the bulk electronic band structures of PbSe and PbS are qualitatively
similar, see Figure 2. From Figure 3c and 3d we observe that for all PbSe and PbS QDs, the
CM threshold coincides with the L4–6 and L5–7 transition energies and lies well above the Σ5–6 transition energy. Moreover, the threshold in bulk PbSe and PbS
crystals (taken from Pijpers et al.)40 also coincides with the transitions. Interestingly, when
we decrease the PbSe QD size to 1.3 nm such that the L4–6 and L5–7 transition energies are lower than twice
the band gap energy, we measure no CM up to our highest photon energy
of 4 eV, equal to 2.5 times the band gap energy for this PbSe QD size.
Hence, these asymmetric optical transitions determine the CM threshold
in both PbSe and PbS quantum confined and bulk crystals, while the
energies of the band gap and of these asymmetric transitions depend
on the size through quantum confinement.

We show the same data
of Figure 3 as a function
of absolute photon energy in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). We find that
on an absolute photon energy scale, the CM threshold is highest for
the smallest QDs and decreases with QD size. This is contrary to the
increase of the CM threshold with QD size on a normalized photon energy
scale. Interestingly, on both scales the CM threshold coincides with
the occurrence of the asymmetric L4–6 and L5–7 transitions, highlighting again that it is not only
the energy of the photon that matters but also the nature of the optical
transition.

The question remains why the CM threshold in PbSe
and PbS quantum
confined and bulk crystals coincides with the L4–6 and L5–7 transitions. For photon energies lower
than the L4–6, L5–7 and Σ5–6 transition energies, electrons are photoexcited
around the L-point from the highest valence band to the lowest conduction
band (bands 5 and 6 in Figure 2). These transitions distribute the excess photon energy almost
symmetrically between the electron and the hole, due to the similar
effective masses of electrons and holes at the valence and conduction
band edges.41 In this case, a photon energy
of at least three times the band gap energy would be required, so
that the electron and the hole have sufficient excess energy to undergo
CM.42 As we have observed from Figure 3 however, the CM
threshold can be at lower photon energy. For photon energies equal
to or higher than the L4–6 and L5–7 transition energies, some electrons are photoexcited from the second
highest valence band to the lowest conduction band (L4–6) or from the highest valence band to the second lowest conduction
band (L5–7). In this case most of the excess photon
energy can be transferred to either the hole (L4–6) or the electron (L5–7), allowing the CM threshold
to be reduced toward two times the band gap energy. These considerations
are discussed in terms of a bulk band structure. Care should be taken
when QDs are studied, since the wave function of spatially confined
electrons in QDs is a mixture of bulk electronic states.43,44 Our previous work however showed that despite quantum confinement,
there exist energy levels with large L4 and L7 character in PbSe QDs, allowing us to clearly identify L4–6 and L5–7 transitions in these systems.28

To get insight into the relation between
the nature of optical
transitions and the CM threshold in PbX quantum confined and bulk
crystals, we performed tight-binding calculations on PbSe QDs with
a diameter of 4 nm for which the calculated band gap is 1.0 eV (see Methods).44−48 We first focus on the distribution of the excess photon energy between
the electron and the hole at the lowest photon energy for which we
measured a QY exceeding unity. This photon energy was 2.75 eV. Figure 4a shows the optical
oscillator strength as a function of carrier energy for absorption
of a 2.75 eV photon. The top of the valence band (L5) is
set to 0 eV and consequently the bottom of the conduction band (L6) to 1 eV. We observe that most states are created with electron
and hole energies distributed around 2.1 eV and −0.7 eV (1.1
and 0.7 eV excess energy), respectively, corresponding to almost symmetric
transitions. Additionally, some electrons and holes are created with
2.6 eV and −1.6 eV of energy (1.6 eV excess energy in either
case), respectively, due to the asymmetric L4–6 and
L5–7 transitions. For significant CM to occur, a
charge carrier not only requires sufficient excess energy but also
its II rate must compete favorably with its cooling rate. We discuss
below that although the electron has sufficient excess energy in the
symmetric transitions, the asymmetric transitions are required to
meet both conditions. The optical oscillator strength in Figure 4a agrees with the
estimate in our previous work that the oscillator strength of the
L4–6 and L5–7 transitions in PbSe
QDs is approximately 1/8 of the oscillator strength at the band gap.28

Figure 4 (a) Calculated optical oscillator strength as a function
of carrier
energy for absorption of a 2.75 eV photon for 4 nm PbSe QDs. The bands
in which electrons and holes are created are indicated as well as
the energy ranges (shaded areas) in which significant CM is possible
considering the competition between II and cooling. (b) Calculated
II time in 4 nm PbSe QDs and measured cooling time in 3.9 nm PbSe
QDs, as a function of carrier excess energy. Below 1.4 eV carrier
excess energy, the II time is more than 10 times higher than the cooling
time and CM is negligible. Above 1.4 eV carrier excess energy, significant
CM becomes possible. (c) Schematic PbSe QD electronic structure with
CM thresholds indicated. The photon energy required to create electrons
or holes above the CM threshold is much higher for symmetric transitions
than for asymmetric transitions, as indicated by the arrows.

To study the competition between
II and cooling, we take the cooling
time in 3.9 nm PbSe QDs from our previously published data on electron
and hole cooling.29Figure 4b shows this cooling time together with the
II time (1/rate) calculated for 4 nm PbSe QDs as a function of carrier
excess energy.14 The cooling time presented
is essentially bulk-like, agreeing with literature on cooling of hot
charge carriers.29,49,50 The II time decreases much faster with carrier excess energy than
the cooling time. This is caused by the strong increase in density
of final states. We assume that for an II time more than 10 times
larger than the cooling time, CM is negligible. From Figure 4b we observe that within this
assumption, significant CM becomes possible for carrier excess energies
above 1.4 eV, as indicated in the shaded areas of Figure 4a and 4b. At 1.4 eV carrier excess energy, we find an II time of 3.5 ps
and corresponding II rate of 0.3 ps–1. Despite the
limits of correctly calculating energy differences with tight-binding
theory, this approach allows us to identify the energetic onset of
efficient CM.

Using Figure 4a
and 4b we now find that at the experimentally
determined CM threshold (at a photon energy of 2.75 eV), asymmetric
L4–6 and L5–7 transitions occur,
creating electrons and holes with sufficient excess energy to undergo
CM and with an II rate that competes favorably with the cooling rate.
Symmetric transitions will also contribute to II as soon as they create
charge carriers with approximately 1.4 eV or more excess energy. This
consideration is summarized in a schematic QD electronic structure
in Figure 4c, where
we show that the photon energy required to achieve sufficient carrier
excess energy for CM is much higher for symmetric transitions than
for asymmetric transitions.

Because of the steep decrease of
the II time with carrier excess
energy observed in Figure 4b, we can calculate an estimate of the QY by assuming that
every charge carrier with sufficient excess energy (>1.0 eV) and
an
II rate that competes favorably with the cooling rate (>0.3 ps–1, or an energy >1.4 eV) undergoes CM. For each
photon
energy, first the excess energy of electrons and holes for all possible
optical transitions is calculated, together with the II rate as in Figure 4b. Next, if the II
rate of both charge carriers is lower than 0.3 ps–1, we set the QY to unity. If the II rate of either charge carrier
for a specific transition is higher than 0.3 ps–1, we assume that CM occurs and increases the QY by one. The total
QY at a photon energy is then the average of the QYs for all possible
optical transitions. In the Supporting Information (Figure S5) we show that experimentally we can estimate a lower
limit to the II rate at the CM threshold of 0.3 ps–1, equal to the II rate used here.

The calculated QY for 4 nm
PbSe QDs is shown in Figure 5 as a function of photon energy
for II by electrons, holes, and both. The calculated total QY slightly
overestimates the experimental results for 3.9 nm PbSe QDs, but has
a similar shape. The larger theoretical result follows from our assumption
that every charge carrier with an excess energy above 1.4 eV undergoes
CM. In practice there is an energy range (∼0.4 eV from Figure 4b) where significant
competition between II and cooling occurs and not all charge carriers
undergo CM. The QY starts rising at a photon energy of 2.6 eV, due
to the occurrence of the L4–6 and L5–7 transitions. The calculated QY increases more rapidly with photon
energy above approximately 3.5 eV, where symmetric transitions start
contributing to II. Above the CM threshold, the calculated QY clearly
does not increase linearly with photon energy. However, a linear fit
is a reasonable approximation of the CM threshold and efficiency.
The calculated QY in Figure 5 rises steeper with photon energy for electrons than for holes.
Experimentally we are unable to make a distinction between the QY
of electrons and holes, but we note that in our earlier work we experimentally
determined that holes cool faster than electrons in PbSe QDs.28,29 This effect would favor cooling in its competition with CM and therefore
cause a more gentle increase of the QY with photon energy for holes.

Figure 5 Calculated
QY for 4 nm PbSe QDs when electrons and holes require
an II rate of at least 0.3 ps–1, compared to the
experimental QY for 3.9 nm PbSe QDs, both as a function of photon
energy.

We note that, besides the asymmetric
division of photon energy,
the nature of the states involved in the L4–6 and
L5–7 transitions could play an important role in
the CM process, due to the different character of the wave functions.
Possibly hole cooling from the fourth to the fifth band or electron
cooling from the seventh to the sixth band is slower than cooling
within a band. It was recently shown that charge cooling between bands
in silicon nanowires indeed is considerably slower than cooling within
a single band.51 Moreover, the matrix element
for II could be larger for a transition between different bands, since
this can occur by conservation of quasi-momentum (i.e., vertical in k-space).52 Both slower cooling and a larger matrix element
for II would favor II in the competition with cooling. Further study
of materials with small (e.g., PbTe)
or large differences in the electronic structure, especially of the
higher bands, compared to PbSe and PbS could provide more insight
in the involvement of these processes.

Conclusions and Outlook
We have shown experimentally that the CM threshold in PbX quantum
confined and bulk crystals coincides with the L4–6 and L5–7 optical transitions. This can be understood
in terms of an asymmetric distribution of photon energy between the
electron and hole. The experimental findings of the QY of charge carriers
produced by CM have been explained on the basis of theoretically calculated
II rates and cooling times extracted from modeling experimental cooling
data. A general understanding of CM based on considerations of the
band structure of the material has been obtained, without the need
to invoke special effects of quantum confinement. With these insights,
we predict that a material will exhibit efficient CM when its band
structure has the following properties. It requires a second conduction
(valence) band at two times the band gap energy which can be populated
due to a high oscillator strength and II should compete favorably
with cooling. Quantum confinement is not necessary for these conditions,
although it may be practical to achieve them. The discussed results
allow for efficient screening of material candidates and rational
engineering of CM efficient materials.

Methods
Tight-Binding
Calculations
The electronic structure
of PbSe QDs was calculated in tight binding using, for each Pb or
Se atom, a basis of sp3d5s* orbitals. The tight-binding
parameters are taken from ref (48). They provide a band structure for bulk PbSe in excellent
agreement with the GW calculations (many-body perturbation theory)
of ref (47) taken as
reference. Using these parameters, we predict band gaps of PbSe QDs versus size very close to those obtained using the tight-binding
parameters of ref (44) that we employed in our previous studies (difference <0.1 eV).
However, in the present work, we preferred to use the parameters of
ref (48) because they
put the minima of the second (L7) and third (L8) conduction bands in close agreement with the GW calculations, whereas
the tight-binding model of ref (44) gives L7 and L8 conduction bands
about 0.3 and 0.6 eV too low in energy, respectively.

The oscillator
strengths for the optical transitions are calculated using the tight-binding
electronic states following refs (45) and (46). In order to account for broadening effects in the optical
spectra, each transition line is replaced by a Lorentzian (full width
at half-maximum of 35 meV). The II rates and QY are calculated using
the methodology described in ref (14).
