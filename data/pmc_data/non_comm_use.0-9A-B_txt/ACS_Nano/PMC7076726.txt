DNA
nanotechnology provides a toolbox for creating custom and precise
nanostructures with nanometer-level accuracy. These nano-objects are
often static by nature and serve as versatile templates for assembling
various molecular components in a user-defined way. In addition to
the static structures, the intrinsic programmability of DNA nanostructures
allows the design of dynamic devices that can perform predefined tasks
when triggered with external stimuli, such as drug delivery vehicles
whose cargo display or release can be triggered with a specified physical
or chemical cue in the biological environment. Here, we present a
DNA origami nanocapsule that can be loaded with cargo and reversibly
opened and closed by changing the pH of the surrounding solution.
Moreover, the threshold pH value for opening/closing can be rationally
designed. We characterize the reversible switching and a rapid opening
of “pH-latch”-equipped nanocapsules using Förster
resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the full cycle
of capsule loading, encapsulation, and displaying the payload using
metal nanoparticles and functional enzymes as cargo mimics at physiologically
relevant ion concentrations.

==== Body
DNA nanotechnology1−3 provides an essential foundation for programmable and innovative
nanoscale structures, devices and advanced materials. DNA nanostructures
have been successfully used for example in creating static nanophotonic
devices,4−7 nanoscopic rulers8,9 and templates for material assembly.10,11 Nevertheless, it is extremely intriguing to explore the possibilities
to build dynamic devices12−14 using DNA as a construction material,
especially by applying the robust and versatile DNA origami technique.15 Examples of such dynamic DNA origami-based devices
include robotics,16−18 molecular-scale precision measurement and diagnostic
tools,19 plasmonic/nanophotonic systems,20 reconfigurable metamolecules,21,22 and information relay systems.23 Dynamic
DNA nanostructures can also find interesting uses in drug delivery24,25 since these nanoscale devices are readily modifiable for targeted
delivery and loading of the specified molecular cargo.26,27 Moreover, they can be programmed to perform user-defined tasks upon
external stimuli, for example, encapsulation and subsequent display
and release of cargo.28,29

So far, dynamics of signal-responsive
prototypes of DNA drug-delivery
vehicles have been realized by conformational changes due to a temperature
gradient,30 strand displacement reactions,31 DNA–protein interactions,24,25 or by taking advantage of photoactivated properties of the system.29,32 Regulation of the dynamic properties may become extremely challenging
in biologically relevant environments, especially with systems relying
on the introduction of additional regulating molecules, such as oligonucleotides
for strand displacement reactions. For this, pH change of the environment
presents an intriguing trigger for the cargo release of drug-delivery
vehicles functioning autonomously in biological environments. Various
compartments of the cell are characterized by a distinct pH, and deviations
from the normal pH can be linked to abnormal cell behavior. For instance,
while healthy cells maintain a lower intracellular pH (∼7.2)
compared to the extracellular pH (∼7.4), cancer cells are distinguished
by an inverted pH gradient with low extracellular pH (∼6.8–7.0)
and high intracellular pH (∼7.3–7.6) necessary for the
multiple altered characteristics of cancer cells.33,34 This raises an interest to demonstrate controlled cargo release
upon similar slight pH increases in physiological conditions. pH-driven
actuation also holds the advantage of being simple and easy to implement:
DNA motifs such as cytosine-rich i-motifs and Hoogsteen-type polypurine-polypyrimidine
triplexes are intrinsically pH responsive,35−37 and incorporating
them into larger DNA nanostructures can be used to control the dynamics
of the structures, avoiding the need for more laborious or costly
chemical modifications or conjugation of external molecules as stimuli-responsive
units. Indeed, both DNA origami structures22,38−41 and tile-based DNA polyhedra42−44 have been successfully functionalized
with pH-responsive DNA moieties for applications in various fields
of research.

In this article, we have designed and assembled
a reconfigurable,
compact, and cargo-shielding DNA origami nanocapsule (Figure 1A) whose reversible opening/closing
cycle can be controlled by a sharp pH change. In other words, the
capsule is equipped with multiple rationally designed “pH-latches”
that work cooperatively. Each of the latches is comprised of two parts:
a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Depending
on the pH of the environment, these counterparts can either form a
parallel triplex DNA via Hoogsteen bonding (closed
state of the capsule, low pH) or hang freely from the capsule (open
state, high pH). The open/close transition (acid dissociation constant,
pKa) of the system can be rationally designed
by selecting the base contents of the latch strands,22,45 thus adding another level of modularity to the system. We have analyzed
the dynamics and functionality of the capsule in detail by Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. Moreover, the capsule
has a functionalizable cavity for anchoring molecular payloads, and
by taking advantage of the reversible opening/closing cycle of the
capsule, we have demonstrated successive loading, encapsulation, and
display of molecular payloads. We have used gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
as cargo mimics for transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based verification
and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzymes for proving the functionality
of the encapsulated cargo by characterizing of enzyme activity.

nanocapsule design and function. (A) A hinged DNA origami
nanocapsule with a HRP payload can be reversibly opened and closed
with the help of eight programmable pH-responsive latches. At high
pH, the latches are open (a hairpin (orange) and a ssDNA (green) detached)
and the capsule halves can move freely, whereas at low pH, the latches
form a triplex DNA thus closing the capsule. (B) A schematic figure
series depicts the full cycle of capsule function. The open capsule
can be loaded with a cargo (yellow sphere with an attachment strand) via hybridization of the anchoring and attachment strands.
The loaded cargo can be encapsulated by lowering pH and further displayed
by increasing pH. The dynamics of the opening and closing can be followed
by FRET analysis when the capsule is equipped by a FRET pair (green
and red dyes). (C) TEM images reveal open nanocapsules with a variety
of opening angles from completely open to barely ajar structures.

Results and Discussion
Here, we
present the design of a dynamic DNA origami nanocapsule
and use FRET- and TEM-based analysis to show that the nanocapsule
can be opened and closed with solution pH and harnessed for loading
and display of cargo molecules. The DNA nanocapsule was folded as
a single structure from the 8064-nucleotide (nt) scaffold. The design
consists of two capsule halves linked together at one long edge by
four ssDNA hinges (Figure 1A), each consisting of 10 nucleotides of nonhybridized scaffold
DNA. The outer dimensions of the nanocapsule are ca. 31 nm × 28 nm × 33 nm (w × h × l), making it roughly spherical,
and it contains an inner cavity with dimensions of 11 nm × 12
nm × 13 nm. The walls of the nanocapsule consist of two layers
of DNA double helices to ensure the required rigidity and stability
for shielding the loaded cargo. In order to avoid multimerization
or aggregation of the nanocapsules through blunt-end stacking interactions,
the outward pointing ends of each DNA helix were passivated with 8-nt
long single-stranded poly-T overhangs.

For introducing a closing/opening
mechanism of choice, a total
of eight latch sites were included in the design at the interface
between the capsule halves. The staple strands at these sites can
be replaced by strands containing a desired latch functionality. Here,
we designed eight pairs of pH latch DNA sequences that were inserted
at these sites as staple strand extensions: One part of the latch
is a DNA duplex, consisting of complementary polypurine and pyrimidine
regions in a single 20 bp hairpin motif. The other part of the latch
in the adjacent half is a single-stranded, 20 nt polypyrimidine DNA
oligonucleotide that forms a parallel DNA triplex with the duplex.
Each latch is designed with a unique base sequence but identical 60%
T-A·T base triplex content to ensure that all latches will open
at the same pH,22,45 but the triplex formation will
only take place between the intended counterparts. The aforementioned
T-A·T base content was chosen to yield pKa ∼ 7.2 according to previously reported triplexes with
similar lengths.22 This targeted pKa value was selected to demonstrate the capsule
function in physiologically relevant conditions (blood pH ∼
7.4, healthy cells ∼7.2, and cancer cells typically ∼7.4–7.6).33,34,46

In addition to the pH latch
(pHL) nanocapsules, we designed and
assembled two types of controls: permanently open nanocapsules with
no locking mechanism (opC) and permanently closed nanocapsules (clC),
in which the pH latches were replaced with complementary ssDNA overhangs.
To first confirm the structural integrity and correct folding of all
types of nanocapsules, the assembled structures were analyzed with
TEM and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). The nanocapsules visualized
with TEM showed well-defined shapes, negligible aggregation (monomer
yield of capsules calculated from the gel electrophoresis was 79 ±
2% (s.d., n = 3)), and clearly distinguishable open
and closed conformations (Figure 1C,D). While nanocapsules in a closed state appear structurally
homogeneous under TEM, the structural flexibility of open nanocapsules
is reflected in a variety of different opening angles. On agarose
gels, all folded structures show a well-defined monomer band and low
amount of oligomerization, but surprisingly, the open and closed states
cannot be differentiated by electrophoretic mobility (Figure S2).

In order to demonstrate that
the opening and closing of the pHL
nanocapsules can be controlled with solution pH, we labeled the opposing
halves of the capsule with an Alexa Fluor 488 (donor)–Alexa
Fluor 594 (acceptor) FRET pair using oligonucleotides with fluorophore
end modifications. The emission profiles upon donor excitation at
460 nm were measured from samples prepared at various pH values between
6.0 and 8.0 in 1 × TAE (40 mM Tris, ∼20 mM acetic acid,
and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) with 15 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM NaCl. FRET efficiency at each pH was quantified
from the acceptor emission intensity increase at 616 nm.

In
acidic conditions (pH 6.4–6.8), a donor excitation results
in a clearly observable acceptor emission (Figure 2A, inset) and a high FRET efficiency, EFRET = 0.67 ± 0.03 (Figure 2A). This indicates that a significant amount
of donor excitation energy is transferred to the acceptor in a close
proximity and, subsequently, that a high portion of the capsules are
in a closed state. In contrast to the high-FRET state at acidic pH,
pHL samples prepared in basic conditions (pH 7.6–8.0) are in
a flexible, open state characterized by EFRET ≈ 0. Emission spectra of the open and closed states of the
pHL nanocapsule show a high correspondence to opC and clC control
samples. Furthermore, emission spectra of opC and clC are not affected
by pH (Figure S1), confirming that the
observed FRET efficiency differences in pHL nanocapsules result solely
from pH-driven conformational changes. Lowering the pH below 6.4 leads
to an increased amount of sample aggregation or possibly other forms
of loss of structural integrity, observed as a further increase in
FRET efficiency unrelated to the pH-dependent conformational change
of individual structures (Figure S3). The
aggregation was observed to be less significant in opC and clC control
samples, indicating that interactions between pH latches of separate
nanocapsules may play a role in the aggregation process. At higher
pH values, the level of aggregation in all samples is very low, including
negligible multimerization via blunt-end stacking
interactions due to an effective passivation of the outward-pointing
DNA double-helix ends with poly-T overhangs.

Figure 2 The pH-controlled opening
and closing of nanocapsules in solution
characterized by FRET. (A) Dependence of FRET efficiency on the solution
pH near the pKa = 7.27. Inset figure shows
emission spectra of the sample at pH 6.4 and pH 8.0 resulting from
the donor excitation at 460 nm. A Hill equation (solid line) has been
fitted to the data points to determine values of pKa and Hill coefficient n. FRET efficiency
values have been calculated based on average donor and acceptor emission
intensity values in three parallel samples. Error limits for each
data point have been calculated according to the propagation of error,
based on the standard deviation between the initial measurements.
(B) Closing and opening kinetics of nanocapsules in the presence of
15, 10, and 5 mM MgCl2. At t = 0, acetic
acid is added to the pH 7.7 solution to rapidly decrease the pH to
6.3. At t = 220 min, the NaCl concentration in the
samples is increased to a physiological concentration (150 mM). Sodium
hydroxide addition at t = 266 min leads to all samples
returning to fully open states. FRET efficiency values have been averaged
from three parallel (and independent) samples, error bars representing
the standard error of the mean. (C) Repeated opening/closing cycles
of the nanocapsules equipped with pH latches (pHL). In addition to
the pHL nanocapsules, the same pH cycling was performed for permanently
closed (clC) and open (opC) control samples. EFRET values in subfigures B and C have both been normalized
to the highest efficiency value observed at a 15 mM MgCl2 concentration (in subfigure B).

At pH 7.0–7.5 (within ca. 0.5 pH
units)
with a pKa of 7.27 ± 0.02, the pHL
nanocapsules undergo a steep transition between the closed and open
states. The transition is characterized by a high Hill coefficient,
3.9 ± 0.5, consistent with the idea of a two-state system working
in a cooperative manner. The pKa value
depends on the relative amount of T-A·T base triads in the pH
latches (here 60%) and has high agreement to the pKa = 7.2 reported by Kuzyk et al. for
plasmonic DNA origami devices actuated with one DNA triplex with identical
length (20 base triads) and T-A·T content.22 Due to the good agreement of the results, we propose that
the pKa of our system could be adjusted
in a similar fashion demonstrated by both Idili et al.45 and Kuzyk et al.22 to a lower pH by decreasing or to a higher pH
by increasing the percentage of T-A·T triplets in the pH latch
strands, enabling fine-tuning the opening threshold for the desired
biological target. Interestingly, we note that the pH sensitivity
does not appear to be affected by the number of pH latches, as the
shape and steepness of the pH response curves of the pHL nanocapsules
and the plasmonic metamolecules presented by Kuzyk et al.15 are also very similar.

In addition
to static measurements, we performed series of kinetic
measurements following the FRET efficiency in an individual sample
after changing the solution pH by addition of small volumes of either
acid or base (Figure 2B). We observed that the closed capsules in acidic conditions open
extremely rapidly after the addition of sodium hydroxide: Measured
FRET efficiency drops to the level of opC control even before the
first measurement at 30 s. In contrast, closing the nanocapsules takes
place gradually over a time course of several hours after lowering
the pH of the sample from 7.7 to 6.3.

When the closing process
was initiated in the presence of lowered
cation concentrations (10 mM or 5 mM MgCl2), we observed
significantly reduced rates of closing as well as a lower amount of
closed structures at the end of the incubation period (Figure 2B). Since the positive charge
of the divalent cations screens the repulsive electrostatic interactions
between the large, negatively charged nanocapsule halves, the result
indicates a heavy role of electrostatic effects in the dynamic properties
of the system. It is likely that a reduced amount of electrostatic
repulsion both increases the probability of formation of the closed
state by reducing the energetic penalty of bringing the two capsule
halves together as well as stabilizes the formed triplexes in the
closed state by decreasing the repulsion both between the large structural
units as well as the interacting latch strands. Thus, we found 15
mM MgCl2 to be the required concentration for successfully
preparing and closing the nanocapsules. At higher MgCl2 concentrations (e.g., 30 mM), further weakening
of the electrostatic repulsion between individual capsules starts
to lead to an increased level of aggregation (Figure S3).

The response time and dynamics of stimuli-responsive
nanosystems
can be heavily dependent on the type of triggering stimulus. In our
system, solution pH change and the associated protonation/deprotonation
of cytosine N3 atoms in the pH latch oligonucleotides can be expected
to take place in a millisecond time scale according to the diffusion
rate of ions. For instance, Idili et al.45 reported both folding (associated with intramolecular
triplex formation) and unfolding of small pH-responsive triplex nanoswitches
in solution taking place within milliseconds, and reconfiguration
times of several hundred milliseconds have also been achieved with
larger DNA origami devices actuated by ion concentrations.47 In contrast, systems relying on the strand displacement
reactions may yield slower reaction rates due to a number of limiting
factors: bifurcation in the branch migration (especially for long
strands), concentration of the strands in the reaction, and the low
diffusion constant of large oligonucleotides. Moreover, each full
strand displacement reaction cycle generates byproducts to the solution,
which may limit their use in specific applications. The closing kinetics
of our system are comparable to similar systems functioning with strand
displacement,48 indicating that the closing
process is affected more by how the overall design of the DNA origami
system promotes the formation of the compact closed state, rather
than the initial trigger. The advantage gained by the pH-sensitivity
is reflected in the opening phase of the nanocapsules, where the response
time is extremely fast and does not rely on the addition of further
triggering elements into the system.

After the capsules had
been closed at low pH and in the presence
of a sufficient level of MgCl2, we tested how their conformational
state responds to physiological salt conditions. In the experiment
presented in Figure 2B, we showed that closed nanocapsules can be introduced to a physiological
NaCl concentration (150 mM) without any change in the FRET efficiency.
To be able to carry out the measurements in a kinetic manner, the
Mg2+ concentration (5, 10, or 15 mM) was not changed during
the measurement. To study the possible effects of a low physiological
Mg2+ concentration (∼0.6 mM in blood),49 we also performed a separate experiment where
closed pHL capsules (with 15 mM MgCl2) were first diluted
to the MgCl2 concentration of 0.6 mM and after that introduced
to a 150 mM NaCl concentration (see Supporting Information). Emission spectra collected from these samples
showed no decrease of FRET efficiency from the MgCl2 depletion,
but in low-Mg2+ conditions, the FRET efficiency was slightly decreased (ca. 22%) after the addition of NaCl (Figure S4A). This observation is supported by the previous observation that
Mg2+ ions might be easily replaced by monovalent Na+ in the DNA origami structure at low-Mg2+ conditions
(<1 mM), thus causing slightly deformed DNA objects.50 In addition, we also characterized the FRET
efficiency of closed pHL nanocapsules in the presence of 1% and 10%
blood plasma (solution pH increases through addition of plasma, but
nevertheless, it stays below 7.2) (Figure S4B). These results together show that the closed state can be maintained
at physiologically relevant conditions, which can be considered an
essential property for potential in vivo drug-delivery
applications.

We also showed that the opening/closing cycle
presented in Figure 2B can be repeated
multiple times by the addition of small volumes of acetic acid or
sodium hydroxide (Figure 2C). Here, the shorter closing period (90 min vs 300 min in Figure 2B) is not enough
to reach the stabilization/plateau of the FRET efficiency in the closing
phase. Nevertheless, the shapes of the FRET efficiency curves in each
closing phase are very similar to each other, proving the reversibility
of the capsule function. This shows that the closing process is not
disturbed by repeated adjustment of the solution pH. When the same
pH cycling was performed for opC and clC nanocapsules, no effect was
observed in the FRET efficiency of opC, but the FRET efficiency of
the clC gradually decreased over each sodium hydroxide addition. TEM
images of clC samples before and after five rounds of pH cycling indicate
that this is linked to the accumulation of structural damage (Figure S5). Furthermore, we tested that the effect
is not related to Na+ concentration (increasing up to 65
mM due to increasing volumes of sodium hydroxide) with a control experiment
where equal concentration and volume of NaCl was added to the samples
(data not shown).

After showing that the nanocapsule opening
and closing can be reliably
triggered by changing the solution pH, we loaded the nanocapsules
in the open state with cargo molecules. We applied both AuNPs and
HRP enzymes as two distinct model types of cargo. To visually examine
the loading of cargos in the nanocapsule, AuNPs were used because
of their high contrast in TEM images, while HRP was chosen for studying
the effects of loading and encapsulation on cargo functionality. In
the chosen encapsulation strategy, the cargo molecule is first conjugated
to one or more DNA oligonucleotides. The conjugate is mixed with nanocapsules
that present a complementary, single-stranded oligonucleotide in their
inner cavity, so that hybridization of the complementary strands leads
to attachment of the cargo inside the cavity (Figure 1B). The AuNP-DNA conjugates were prepared
with a modified salting protocol,51 and
they were purified and mixed with a nanocapsule, followed by a thermal
annealing to increase the loading yield. Analogous HRP-DNA conjugates
were produced by covalently linking HRP via its surface
lysines to thiol-modified oligonucleotides with the sulfosuccinimidyl
4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC)
cross-linker.

TEM images of AuNP-loaded nanocapsules show that
the pHL nanocapsules
can be successfully loaded by anchoring the particles into the nanocapsule
cavity at high pH (Figure 3A). By counting the number of open nanocapsule structures
that display a AuNP at the expected attachment site, we estimated
that the loading yield of the particles is 40–55% (n = 110) (Figure S6). Decreasing
the pH leads to cargo encapsulation, and importantly, TEM images 
confirm that the loaded cargo does not prevent the capsules from closing
(Figure 3B). Likewise,
the FRET efficiencies of HRP-loaded pHL and opC nanocapsules at pH
6.4 are identical to the corresponding capsule samples without cargo
(Figure S7), so that the result obtained
from individual structures under TEM is also generalizable to bulk
solution.

(pH 8.2), displaying loaded AuNP cargo molecules. (B) AuNPs encapsulated

in subfigures A and B is 50 nm. (C) Catalytic activity of HRP-loaded
pHL and opC nanocapsules as well as free HRP at pH 7.8. Product formation
(oxidation of ABTS to ABTS•+ by HRP) in the presence
of 1 mM ABTS and 4 mM H2O2 is observed with
an increase of ABTS•+ absorption at 420 nm. Values
at each time point have been calculated as the mean of three parallel
samples, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
(D) Product formation at pH 6.4 (1 mM ABTS, 4 mM H2O2), including an opC control assembled without a cargo anchoring
strand (opC-anchor). Product formation curves for all measured ABTS
concentrations (0.125–4 mM) at both pH values are presented
in Figure S8. (E) Maximum reaction velocities
(Vmax) and Michaelis constants (Km) at pH 7.8 from the Michaelis–Menten
fit to the initial product formation rates between 0 and 300 s in
each sample type. Vmax values have been
normalized to the value of free HRP. Values for both Vmax and Km have been calculated
as the weighted mean of fit results for three parallel samples, weighted
by the fit error. Error bars show the error of the weighted mean.
(F) Vmax and Km values at pH 6.4. The values and error bars were calculated as in
subfigure E.

In addition to immobilizing
cargo molecules within the nanocapsules,
we characterized how the functionality of the cargo responds to the
loading and encapsulation process. Thus, we compared the enzymatic
activity of HRP in three different sample types at both pH 6.4 and
7.8: free HRP without DNA strand(s), HRP inside pHL nanocapsules,
and HRP inside opC nanocapsules. The measurements were performed by
detecting the rate of ABTS oxidation by HRP in the presence of H2O2. The oxidation of ABTS by HRP leads to the formation
of an ABTS•+ radical, which has an absorption maximum
at 420 nm, and therefore velocity of the process can be measured spectrometrically
by following the increase of A420 after
the substrate is mixed to HRP-containing samples.

We first ensured
that the cargo attachment within the nanocapsules
is specific to the cargo anchoring strand. Since HRP cannot be reliably
detected in TEM images, the specificity was assessed with enzyme activity
measurements. The opC capsules were assembled either with or without
a cargo anchoring strand (additional opC-anchor control), mixed with
HRP-DNA conjugates, and purified from unbound enzymes with PEG precipitation.52 After purification, clear HRP activity was detected
in the opC samples assembled with the cargo anchoring strand, while
the opC-anchor controls showed virtually no activity (Figure 3D). In addition to confirming
that HRP binding to the nanocapsules is specific to the anchoring
strand, this shows that PEG precipitation efficiently removes unbound
enzymes from the samples.

We observed that HRP remains fully
functional after loading and
encapsulation. Furthermore, the ABTS oxidation rates were higher in
the nanocapsule-HRP samples (both pHL and opC) than in the samples
containing free HRP at both measured pH values. This can be seen both
directly in the product formation curves (Figure 3C,D) as well as in the maximum reaction rates
(Vmax) determined for each sample type
by a Michaelis–Menten analysis of catalytic rates measured
at varying ABTS concentrations (Figure 3E,F) (product formation plots and Michaelis–Menten
curves for each sample are presented in Figure S8). All sample types displayed greater reaction rates at pH
6.4 than at pH 7.8, which is a predictable result based on the known
fact that the catalytic activity of HRP is pH dependent, increasing
with decreasing pH, and a pH optimum at pH 6.0–6.5.53 At pH 6.4, the Vmax of HRP inside both types of nanocapsules at 2 nM nanocapsule concentration
was approximately 2 times larger than of free HRP at a 2 nM enzyme
concentration (Figure 3F). At pH 7.8, the difference was similar but slightly less prominent
(1.5-fold in pH lock capsule sample, and 1.8-fold in the open control)
(Figure 3E). Since
the quantity Vmax depends on both enzyme
concentration and its catalytic activity (Vmax = kcat[E]total, where kcat is the turnover number of the enzyme, and
[E]total the enzyme concentration), differences in Vmax can likewise signify either enzyme concentration
or activity differences between the compared samples. While the exact
HRP concentration in the HRP-loaded nanocapsules is unknown, the DNA
origami concentration in the samples sets an effective 2 nM upper
limit to the HRP concentration, since this would correspond to a 100%
encapsulation yield. In this case, the results would indicate a 2-fold
increase in the kcat of HRP upon encapsulation.
As with the 40–55% encapsulation yield estimated for the AuNPs,
the real encapsulation yield of HRP is also likely smaller than 100%.
Thus, the kcat value can likewise be expected
to be further enhanced. The activity increase is well in line with
previous studies showing that the catalytic activity of enzymes conjugated
to DNA nanostructures can differ significantly from free enzymes.53−55 In the case of HRP, this has been observed as an activity increase;
Zhao et al.55 reported
as high as a 10-fold enhancement of kcat when HRP was confined inside DNA nanocages. While a comprehensive
understanding of the mechanisms of such activity effects has not yet
been reached,56 one explanation for the
higher catalytic rate of DNA origami-conjugated HRP has been suggested
to be a lower local pH near the origami surface.53 According to the activity profile reported by Zhang et al.,53 HRP activity is also
more sensitive to pH changes around pH 6.4 than pH 7.8, which could
in part explain why we also observe a slightly larger activity enhancement
at pH 6.4 than at pH 7.8.

Interestingly, at pH 6.4, the formation
of ABTS•+ both in pHL and opC nanocapsules is highly
similar (Figure 3D).
The Michaelis constant Km describes the
ability of the substrate to
interact with the enzyme, so that higher Km values can indicate either that the enzymes are less accessible
to the substrate or that their affinity toward the substrate at the
specific conditions is lower. Km values
of HRP inside an open or closed nanocapsule, or of free HRP, show
no significant differences between each other (Figure 3E,F) at either of the measured pHs. While
it could be assumed that at pH 6.4, the closed state of the pHL nanocapsules
blocks the diffusion of ABTS to the encapsulated HRP, the results
on the contrary suggest that HRP is equally accessible to the substrate
in all of the cases. This leads to a conclusion that the nanocapsules
are porous enough for the low molecular weight (548.68 g/mol) ABTS
to diffuse into the inner cavity. However, encapsulation still provides
shielding from larger molecules. The pHL nanocapsules mixed at a closed,
low pH state with AuNPs do not contain particles within the capsules
(Figure S6), demonstrating that the DNA
barrier effectively blocks these larger particles (5 nm gold core)
from entering the nanocapsule cavity.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have presented the design and characterization
of a dynamic DNA origami nanocapsule. We have shown that the nanocapsule
can be loaded with various types of molecular cargo, here AuNPs and
HRP, and that the cargo can be selectively displayed after exposing
the nanocapsule to the specified external cue. Our multilayer DNA
origami-based carrier has been designed for high stability and protection
of enclosed molecules and for functionalization with multiple stimuli-responsive
units for cooperative actuation.

We have shown that when the
nanocapsules were equipped with multiple
DNA residues that form Hoogsteen triplexes in low pH, reconfiguration
between open and closed conformational states could be induced with
solution pH changes in a predictable and repeatable manner under physiologically
relevant salt conditions. Application of Hoogsteen triplexes for pH-actuation
gives an important aspect of programmability for the system. The pKa can be chosen simply by selecting the base
content of the latch strands, and the measured pKa was seen to be in close agreement with the predicted
value for the latch sequences.22 As determined
from FRET analysis, the conformational state of the nanocapsules is
also highly sensitive to pH differences. An approximately 0.5 pH unit
increase is sufficient to switch the bulk sample from a closed state
to an open state with a very rapid response time.

In order to
reach full functionality as a drug delivery vehicle,
we envision that our system could still be further functionalized
with additional stimuli-responsive or targeting groups for specific
cell types. It could also be interesting to explore how various protein-
or polymer-coating strategies49,57 presented for static
objects could be applied for such dynamic systems to increase the in vivo stability and compatibility while preserving the
delicate functionality and dynamic properties of the system. All in
all, the presented compatibility with physiologically relevant medium,
programmability of the pKa value, high
pH sensitivity, and fast kinetics of the opening give our system multiple
intriguing properties in terms of the development of smart, targeted
DNA-based drug delivery systems that are capable of responding to
stimuli present in living organisms and that would function independently
of additional external triggers.

Methods
Nanocapsule
Design and Assembly
The DNA nanocapsule
was designed in a honeycomb lattice using caDNAno v 2.2.0,58 and the three-dimensional structure was predicted
with CanDo simulations.59,60 Self-assembly of the
structures was performed as a single batch reaction containing a 20
nM p8064 scaffold (Tilibit Nanosystems) and 7.5× excess of staple
strands (Integrated DNA Technologies) in 1× capsule folding buffer
(FOB) (1× capsule FOB: 1× TAE, 15 mM MgCl2, 5
mM NaCl). The reactions were heated in G-storm G1 Thermal Cycler to
65 °C and annealed by cooling to 59 °C with a rate of 1
°C/15 min and then to 12 °C with rate 0.25 °C/45 min.
The excess staple strands were removed from the solution using PEG
precipitation in the presence of 7.5% (w/v) PEG 8000.52 Folding yield was assessed by integration over the AGE
band intensities (Figure S2A).

Fluorescence
Measurements
FRET-labeled nanocapsule
samples were analyzed with a Biotek Cytation 3 plate reader using
black Costar flat bottom 96-well plates. The donor (Alexa Fluor 488)
was excited at 460 nm and the acceptor (Alexa Fluor 546) at 560 nm.
All FRET measurements were conducted at room temperature. FRET efficiency
was calculated from the increase of acceptor emission in the presence
of energy transfer:  where IAD is the
acceptor emission intensity following donor excitation, IAA is the acceptor emission intensity (at 616 nm) after
acceptor excitation, εAA is the acceptor extinction
coefficient at the acceptor excitation wavelength (30,817 M–1 cm–1), and εAD and εDD are the acceptor and donor extinction coefficients at the
donor excitation wavelength (1985 M–1cm–1 and 19,848 M–1cm–1). Extinction
coefficient values at the excitation wavelengths were calculated by
combining the measured absorption spectra of the fluorophore-modified
oligonucleotides with the fluorophore extinction coefficients at absorption
maxima provided by IDT. Calculating the FRET efficiency as described
enables using the value of IAA as an internal
reference for acceptor emission intensity (and implicitly, quantum
yield) in the absence of energy transfer. In addition, the equation
includes an assumption that donor and acceptor fluorophores are present
in the sample in a 1:1 molar ratio, which can be reasonably assumed
for a DNA origami system where both the number and location of the
fluorophores are highly controlled.

For the pH titration experiment,
nanocapsule samples folded in the normal FOB (pH 8.2) were resuspended
to pH-adjusted buffers (pH 6.0–8.0 in 0.2 pH unit intervals)
after PEG purification of excess staples. In order to determine the
values for the closed state, FRET efficiency EFRET (closed), pKa, and the Hill
coefficient n, FRET efficiencies measured at each
pH were fitted with the Hill equation:  

Kinetic Fluorescence Measurements
FRET efficiency measurements
for the kinetic response of the FRET efficiency after solution pH
changes were based on single-wavelength recordings of the sample emission
intensity at 517 nm (IDD) and 616 nm (IAD) after donor excitation at 460 nm. Changes
in capsule conformation were followed by calculating relative FRET
efficiency as  where pH of the sample was cycled between
6.1–6.3 and 7.7–8.0 by adding small volumes (2–4
μL) of 0.5 M acetic acid or 0.5 M sodium hydroxide.

TEM Imaging
Nanocapsule samples which were purified
with PEG precipitation were absorbed on plasma cleaned (20 s oxygen
plasma flash) Formvar carbon-coated copper grids (FCF400-Cu, Electron
Microscopy Science) for TEM imaging. A 3 μL droplet of DNA origami
solution was applied onto the carbon-coated side of the TEM grid,
and the excess sample solution was blotted away with filter paper
after an incubation of 2 min. The samples were stained using a 2%
aqueous uranyl formate solution with 25 mM NaOH. Excess stain solution
was blotted away with filter paper after 40 s. After these procedures,
the sample was left to dry under ambient conditions for at least 30
min before imaging. The TEM images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai
12 Bio-Twin instrument operated at an acceleration voltage of 120
kV.

AuNP-DNA Conjugate Preparation and AuNP Encapsulation
The steps of AuNP-DNA conjugation were all carried out at 40 °C
with constant shaking, if not stated otherwise. First, 20 μL
of AuNPs of 5 nm diameter (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with 0.4 μL
1% SDS water solution for 20 min. Then 2 μL of thiolated oligos
(100 μM, Integrated DNA Technologies) was added and incubated
for 30 min. In the salting process, first 0.2 μL of 2.5 M NaCl
was added at 2 min interval for 6 times, followed by additions of
0.4 μL and 0.8 μL of NaCl for 6 times each at the same
interval. After the salting, the AuNP-DNA conjugates were mixed with
30 μL of folding buffer (with 0.02% SDS) and incubated for 1
h. Finally, the conjugates were purified from the free oligos by spin-filtration
through a 100 kDa MWCO Amicon filter at RT and 14000 rcf for 10 min
and repeated for 4 times. In each filtration step, 480 μL of
folding buffer at either pH 6 or pH 8 was added in order to match
the nanocapsule sample pH. For the AuNP encapsulation, the AuNP-DNA
and nanocapsule with complementary cargo strands were mixed in a 10:1
AuNP:origami ratio and thermally annealed from 40 to 20 °C (−0.1
°C/min).

HRP-DNA Conjugation and HRP Encapsulation
HRP (Thermo
Scientific) was covalently conjugated to single-stranded 5′-thiol-modified
DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) by using the sulfosuccinimidyl
4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC)
cross-linker (Thermo Scientific). To form maleimide-activated HRP,
HRP and sulfo-SMCC were individually dissolved in 50 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.2), mixed in a 1:20 enzyme:cross-linker molar ratio,
and incubated at RT for 2 h. The thiol groups in the oligonucleotides
were deprotected by incubating the strands dissolved in water with
an 100-fold molar excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Aldrich
Chemistry) for 1–2 h at RT. The unreacted cross-linker in the
HRP-sulfo-SMCC mixture, as well as excess TCEP in the DNA-TCEP mixture,
was removed by spin-filtration with Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cutoff filters
(EMD Millipore). One mM EDTA was added in the oligo buffer during
spin-filtration. Maleimide-activated HRP was then mixed with the thiol-modified
oligos in a 1:2 DNA:enzyme ratio. HRP was used in excess in order
to minimize the amount of free oligonucleotides in the product. HRP
contains six surface lysines, out of which three have been shown to
be accessible to chemical modifications,61 so conjugation with thiol-modified oligonucleotides can be expected
to yield a mixture of conjugates with different HRP:DNA ratios. Since
this heterogeneity is not relevant for loading the nanocapsule, conjugate
composition was not further analyzed. Thus, the conjugates were used
without further purification and mixed in a 15–20-fold molar
excess with cargo-strand containing nanocapsules in 1× FOB (pH
8.2). To maximize the encapsulation yield, the HRP-nanocapsule mixture
was thermally annealed (from 40 to 20 °C, −0.1 °C/40
s). After annealing, the samples were incubated further for 12 h at
+4 °C, after which unbound enzymes were removed by PEG precipitation.
Enzyme-loaded, purified nanocapsules were resuspended in 1× FOB
at either pH 6.4 or 7.8, and the enzymatic activity in the samples
was measured after overnight incubation at +4 °C.

HRP Activity
Measurements
Enzymatic activity of HRP
was determined by measuring the rate of ABTS oxidation in the presence
of H2O2 at varying ABTS concentrations. Measurements
were performed in 1× FOB adjusted to pH 6.4 or pH 7.8 with acetic
acid, at either 2 nM HRP concentration (free HRP samples) or 2 nM
DNA origami concentration (HRP-loaded nanocapsule samples) with a
total 80 μL sample volume on a clear 96-well microwell plate
(Thermo Scientific) at +25 °C. The samples were first diluted
with a FOB containing H2O2, in a 4 mM final
H2O2 concentration. Immediately after this,
an ABTS solution was added to the sample in either 0.125 mM, 0.25
mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, or 4 mM final ABTS concentration. Formation
of the oxidized product ABTS•+ was monitored by
measuring the A420 of the samples in 20
s intervals over 20 min with a Cytation 3 cell imaging multimode reader
(BioTek). To determine Vmax and Km for each sample type, the initial oxidation
rates for each ABTS concentration were determined by fitting a linear
equation to the data points at the first 300 s after starting the
reaction, and a Michaelis–Menten equation,  was fitted to the data points. Curve fitting
was done with OriginPro version 2019 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,
MA, USA).
