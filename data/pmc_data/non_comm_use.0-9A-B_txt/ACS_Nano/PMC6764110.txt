The
DNA origami technique has proven to have tremendous potential
for therapeutic and diagnostic applications like drug delivery, but
the relatively low concentrations of cations in physiological fluids
cause destabilization and degradation of DNA origami constructs preventing in vivo applications. To reveal the mechanisms behind DNA
origami stabilization by cations, we performed atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations of a DNA origami rectangle in aqueous solvent
with varying concentrations of magnesium and sodium as well as polyamines
like oligolysine and spermine. We explored the binding of these ions
to DNA origami in detail and found that the mechanism of stabilization
differs between ion types considerably. While sodium binds weakly
and quickly exchanges with the solvent, magnesium and spermine bind
close to the origami with spermine also located in between helices,
stabilizing the crossovers characteristic for DNA origami and reducing
repulsion of parallel helices. In contrast, oligolysine of length
ten prevents helix repulsion by binding to adjacent helices with its
flexible side chains, spanning the gap between the helices. Shorter
oligolysine molecules with four subunits are weak stabilizers as they
lack both the ability to connect helices and to prevent helix repulsion.
This work thus shows how the binding modes of ions influence the stabilization
of DNA origami nanostructures on a molecular level.

==== Body
DNA origami
is a robust and
reliable method for designing and constructing uniquely addressable
DNA-based nanostructures. By exploiting the programmability of Watson–Crick
base pairing, circular single-stranded scaffold strands are folded
into preprogrammed 2D or 3D nanostructures using shorter complementary
staple strands.1−4 Controlled folding is obtained as each staple strand binds to multiple
regions of the scaffold strand, forming antiparallel double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) helices interconnected via Holliday junctions or crossovers.
Because of their biocompatibility, nontoxicity,5−8 and unique addressability, DNA
origami structures have been used as drug delivery vehicles,7,9,10 artificial lipid membrane channels,11,12 and as a molecular breadboard for enzymatic and chemical reactions.13,14 A recent demonstration of the possibilities of DNA origami is the
“inside-out virus”, a hollow DNA assembly containing
proteins that are released upon transfection into HeLa cells.15

Although the above examples show the potential
of DNA origami in
nanomedicine and synthetic biology, applicability is impaired by the
lack of structural integrity of DNA origami nanostructures in biologically
relevant environments. There are two main reasons for this instability
that hinder application of DNA origami nanostructures for biomedical
objectives. First, nucleases present in biological environments degrade
DNA nanostructures with, depending on the exact design, half-lives
in the order of hours to days.16−18 Second, DNA origami comprises
a high density of negatively charged phosphates on the DNA backbone.
Though the stability of DNA origami has been shown to be strongly
dependent on the exact design of the origami as well as on the identity
of the buffer,19 high concentrations of
multivalent cations are therefore required to overcome repulsive forces.
In in vitro experiments typically 5–20 mM
Mg2+ is used, which is an order of magnitude higher than
typical in vivo environments.2,20

Several solutions to these problems have been proposed including
encapsulation of the nanostructure in a lipid bilayer membrane,21 design of polyhedral nanostructures that remain
stable at lower cation concentrations,22,23 and coating
DNA-based nanostructures with cationic polyamines like poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate) (PDMAEMA).24 Recently, Ponnuswamy
et al. identified poly(l-lysine) (Kn) with n at least 10 as a particularly stabilizing
polyamine for DNA origami in low Mg2+ environments that
also provides protection against nucleases when conjugated to polyethylene
glycol (PEG). The authors also identified spermine (Spm4+) and spermidine as stabilizing polyamines, although these seem to
dissociate from the DNA origami over time.25 Oligolysine (Figure S1a) has been studied
in relation to DNA vectors as it has been proposed as a transfection
agent in gene therapy,26,27 while Spm4+ (Figure S1b) and spermidine are naturally occurring
molecules involved in DNA condensation and cell longevity.28,29 Such polyamines and other multivalent cations have been shown to
condense double-stranded DNA at certain concentration ranges.30−36 Although many studies have been performed on the interaction of
DNA with polyamines and Mg2+ and Na+,37−46 mechanistic insights into the stabilization of DNA origami and its
characteristic crossovers by these cations on a molecular level are
still lacking.

Here we present atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of
a 512 base pair DNA origami rectangle with varying concentrations
of Mg2+ and Na+, K10, and Spm4+ and analyze the stability of the DNA nanostructure in these
different environments at time scales up to 100 ns. First, we investigate
global structural fluctuations
of the origami, after which we focus on local fluctuations and base
pair integrity. Finally, we zoom in to analyze the binding of individual
ions to the DNA origami at atomistic detail, with a special focus
on the crossover-junctions that are characteristic for DNA origami.
The root-mean-square deviation and aspect ratio of the origami rectangle
reveal a large deviation from the initial structure in environments
with only Na+. In contrast, structural integrity of the
origami is observed in environments with Mg2+, Spm4+, or K10. Analyses of the hydrogen bonding and
internal angles reveal that crossovers and nicks are the main hotspots
where disruptions of the origami structure occur. We show that Mg2+ resides near the DNA origami for extended periods of time
compared to Na+. By aligning a crossover over multiple
timesteps, we demonstrate that Mg2+ ions occupy particular
locations near the DNA, while Na+ ions are more delocalized
and at larger distance from the DNA. Although both K10 and
Spm4+ effectively stabilize the DNA origami, the underlying
mechanisms for these two polyamines differ significantly. While K10 mainly overcomes repulsion between DNA helices by spanning
from one helix to another, Spm4+ efficiently screens the
charges on the DNA backbone by binding in the grooves of the helices
along the phosphate groups as well as in between helices. Compared
to K10, Spm4+ also results in higher amine concentrations
near the crossovers, preserving the “H”-conformation
of crossovers and planarity of the origami. To test whether the observed
mechanistic differences between Spm4+ and K10 depend on their difference in polyvalency, we finally set up one
additional simulation containing K4 as counterions. This
work thus reveals the differences in the binding modes of these ions
to DNA origami and offers insight into DNA origami stabilization on
a molecular level: an important prerequisite for biomedical applicability
of these versatile nanostructures.

Results and Discussion
Simulations
The DNA origami design in our simulations
is based on the original 8192 base pair Rothemund rectangle1 but comprises a reduced number of 512 base pairs
to maintain computational feasibility in the atomistic MD simulations
(Figure 1a). A schematic
representation of our model compared to the original Rothemund rectangle,
as well as the full DNA sequence, is shown in Figure S2. An atomistic model of the DNA origami was generated
and simulated in five aqueous solutions with distinct ionic content,
10 mM Mg2+, which is a typical concentration for in vitro experiments, a mix of 5 mM Mg2+ and
10 mM Na+, 20 mM Na+, K10, and Spm4+. These are denoted as Magnesium, Mixed, Sodium, PLL-10,
and Spermine simulation, respectively. The exact
content of each simulation is shown in Table S1. We first performed an equilibration protocol in which the positions
of DNA origami backbone atoms are held fixed and ions diffuse toward
the DNA origami. After the number of ions near the origami stabilized,
all constraints were released and 100 ns MD production runs were initiated.
Simulation details, as well as the methods used for solvation and
ionization, are described in the Methods Section.
Snapshots of the final configurations of the five systems are shown
in Figure 1b–f,
respectively.

Global Conformational Changes
We
first assessed how
the different ionic environments affect global deformations of the
origami construct. A conventional measure of the global deformations
of a structure is the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). Figure 1g shows the RMSD
of the DNA origami backbone atoms from their initial positions as
a function of time. For all simulations, the RMSD increases during
roughly the first half of the trajectory before reaching a plateau.
In the Magnesium, Sodium, and Mixed simulations, a trend of decreasing RMSD values with
increasing Mg2+ concentration is observed. The Spermine and PLL-10 simulations show similar
RMSD values that lie significantly lower than those in the simulations
containing Na+ and Mg2+. These reduced global
fluctuations are consistent with the experimental observation that
these multivalent ions are able to stabilize DNA origami structures.25 To verify if the simulations reach steady state,
we also calculated the RMSD of the backbone atoms from their positions
halfway through the simulation (Figure S3), which indicated that after 50 ns, the global conformations of
the structures remain largely the same, which made us confident that
the time scale of our simulations is sufficiently long.

Since
RMSD only shows the average magnitude of deviations from a reference
structure, we subsequently explored measures that describe the shape
of the origami. As the origami construct is rectangular, an evident
measure of the global structure is the aspect ratio, defined as the
ratio between the sizes of the origami in the direction of the DNA
double helices and in the direction in the origami plane perpendicular
to the double helices. In Figure 1h, the aspect ratios of the DNA origami constructs
in the five simulations are shown as a function of time. All initial
structures, with aspect ratio 1.4, are elongated in the direction
along the helices, and all simulations initially show a decreasing
aspect ratio in time. While the aspect ratio in the Magnesium simulation stabilizes at a value approaching that of a square origami,
the aspect ratio in the Sodium and Spermine simulations rises again after 25 ns. Visual inspection reveals an
expansion of the DNA helices perpendicular to the helices in the Sodium simulation as well as a global twist in the structure
of the origami. This causes the origami to deviate from an approximately
flat rectangle and to extend over the entire simulation box at the
end of the simulation, which renders the description of the structure
by the aspect ratio of a 2D rectangle rather invalid. In contrast,
the origami structure in the Spermine simulation
becomes more oblong over time. This increase in aspect ratio originates
from a closer packing of the helices, which can be attributed to ability
of Spm4+ to effectively screen the negative charges on
the backbone phosphates causing an attractive force between helices.
Attraction of parallel DNA helices has been observed in earlier experiments,31−34 and the mechanism has been debated for many years,47 with attempts to describe this effect using counterion
correlation theories like the Wigner crystal model,48−50 bridging model,51,52 or more recently, an overlapping shell model.53,54 It has been established that polyelectrolytes with a charge of at
least three are required to observe this behavior.32,55 However, whereas these theories are aimed at parallel DNA helices,
an essential feature of DNA origami is the connection of helices through
Holliday junction-like crossovers, which we will analyze in detail
further. The opposite behavior, that is, the observed expansion of
the origami perpendicular to the helical axes in the Magnesium, Mixed, Sodium, and to a smaller
extent the PLL-10 simulations can analogously be
rationalized by a lower efficiency of the ions in these simulations
to screen the electrostatic interactions on the DNA backbone compared
to Spm4+, leading to repulsion of neighboring helices and
an aspect ratio closer to 1. This is corroborated by a previous work,
where a linear relationship between Mg2+ concentration
and DNA origami area was established.56 Also, similar conclusions have been drawn from small-angle X-ray
scattering experiments by Qiu et al.32,57,58

To quantify the screening of the negative charges
on the DNA backbone
phosphates, we subsequently counted the number of ions condensing
on the origami. In Figure 1i, the fraction of DNA charge compensated by ions within 5
Å (the characteristic distance to find bound ions in, see Figure S4, and of the order of the Debye length
in physiological solution47) of DNA atoms
in the Sodium, Mixed, and Magnesium simulations is shown as a function of time. In all cases, this fraction
remains constant over time, with higher values in systems containing
more Mg2+. As the positive charges of K10 and
Spm4+ are centered on their nitrogen atoms, the fraction
of DNA charge compensated by these nitrogens within 5 Å of DNA
atoms for the PLL-10 and Spermine simulations is plotted in Figure 1i as well. Spm4+ and K10 both
show fractions higher than in the other simulations, which can be
attributed to the polyvalency effects of these charged molecules.
Bloomfield28 has shown that condensation
of DNA occurs when more than 90% of its charge is neutralized. The
observed increase in aspect ratio in the Spermine simulation is therefore explained by the high number of Spm4+ ions, approximately 90%, localized near the origami. The
fraction of K10 nitrogens near the origami rises slowly
compared to the other ions but steadily reaches a level close to the
fraction of Spm4+ ions. Together, the RMSD, aspect ratio,
and ion condensation analyses show that Na+ and Mg2+ cause larger global conformational changes than do Spm4+ and K10 and that the change of shape of the origami
itself is significantly different in the Spermine simulation. Na+ has a lower affinity for the DNA origami
than Mg2+, followed by K10 and Spm4+, which cause gradually less repulsion between parallel DNA helices.

Structure and Stability
Having established the effect
of the different ions on global conformational changes, we next examined
the fluctuations of the structures in more detail to obtain insight
in local deformations and DNA origami stability. To that end, we calculated
the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) for the center of mass for
each nucleotide. Figure 2a shows a representation of these RMSF values for the Magnesium simulation, containing the typical ionic environment in in vitro experiments, mapped onto the time-averaged structure.
The largest fluctuations in space occur at the edges of the origami,
while the center remains rather rigid. The increased fluctuations
at the edges of the DNA origami are caused by the lack of crossovers
in the edge regions, which comprise a relatively large part of the
origami design used in our simulations. The full-size origami typically
employed experimentally would have a relatively much larger interconnected
part constrained by crossovers. The fluctuations at the edges are
also difficult to compare with experiments, as typical DNA origami
experiments exclude the edge staples. This is because the ends of
the origami helices, where one strand terminates and its complementary
forms a U-turn, effectively form blunt ends, causing aggregation between
separate origamis.1 These effects could
be diminished by constructing an infinite DNA origami system that
binds to itself over the periodic boundaries,56 though imposing such strict constraints upon the origami could introduce
artifacts in its own. A qualitatively similar picture as observed
for Mg2+ is displayed for the other ion types (see Figure S5). However, the magnitude of fluctuations
clearly differs between simulations and shows a trend comparable to
the final RMSD values where the fluctuations in the Sodium simulation are highest and that in the PLL-10 simulation
lowest.

distributions of the angle θ for all five simulations. (h) Probability
distributions of the angle ϕ for all five simulations.

As destabilization of DNA is typically associated
with dehybridization
of base pairs, we also analyzed whether the base pairs in the initial
structure remain intact during the simulations. To this end, we quantified
the fractions of time base pairs are broken. A base pair is defined
to be intact, that is, not broken, if it has formed two or three hydrogen
bonds for A-T and G-C pairs, respectively, where we count a hydrogen
bond if the hydrogen-acceptor distance is within 2.9 Å and the
donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle is at least 120°. Analysis of the Magnesium simulation (Figure 2b) shows that primarily base pairs near crossover regions
and at the edges of the origami are broken. Base pairs in blunt ends
at the edges are susceptible to fraying, while bases near crossovers
in the center of the origami experience a larger stress from the structure
that forces it in a certain conformation, which is not optimal for
the formation of DNA base pairs. No clear difference between different
ion concentrations or ion types is observed (see Figure S6), which indicates that breaking of base pairs near
crossovers is not related to ion types but inherent to the DNA origami.
Further research with other DNA origami designs could explain whether
this is a design-specific effect or if this is inherent to all DNA
origami constructs.

While the RMSF and base pair analyses reveal
that the extent of
internal instabilities in the origami structures is similar across
simulations, small local deformations could still drive structural
deformations at the global level. To quantify these local deformations,
we studied bending of DNA helices, as well as the angles between two
helices in crossover regions for different ion types. First, the angle
between the two vectors connecting the centers of mass of three subsequent
base pairs is assessed (Figure 2c). In Figure 2d and e, this angle ψ averaged over time is shown as a function
of the base index (i) within the two middle helices
of the DNA origami for the Sodium simulation as well
as a snapshot of the corresponding helices. The angles at crossover
locations are clearly larger than those in regions without crossovers,
which corroborate recent coarse grained-simulations of a larger DNA
origami.59 Interestingly, in helix 5 (Figure 2e), an additional
peak is observed at base index 38, that is, eight bases away from
the nearest crossover. Inspection of the DNA sequence shows that at
this position one staple strand ends and another one starts, effectively
introducing a nick in the helix. That in helix 4 no clear kink is
observed at a similar nick present at base index 22, may be attributed
to the presence of a crossover only three bases away. These ψ-profiles
repeat across the DNA origami (see Figure S7), matching the inherent periodicity of the design. Since crossover
regions are the main difference between DNA origami nanostructures
and previous work on the condensation of parallel DNA bundles, we
aimed to characterize these regions in more detail. To this end, we
defined two more angles, θ and ϕ, described by the four
vectors between the centers of mass of base pairs adjacent to the
crossovers and those three base pairs away (Figure 2f). Here, θ is defined as the angle
between parallel vectors across helices, while ϕ is defined
as the angle between antiparallel vectors within a helix. Probability
density functions of the angles for all five simulations, averaged
over time and all crossovers, are shown in Figure 2g and h. For θ, a trend can be observed
in the Sodium, Mixed, and Magnesium simulations where a decreasing amount of Mg2+ results in wider angles. This is in line with the difference
in aspect ratios in Figure 1h, where we observe that lower Mg2+ concentrations
lead to stronger repulsion between DNA helices, forcing crossovers
in an “X”-conformation. The PLL-10 and,
even more strongly, the Spermine simulations display
the smallest θ angles, showing that the crossovers retain an
“H”-conformation. In contrast, no similar clear trend
with Mg2+ concentration can be distinguished in the probability
distributions of ϕ. Visual inspection reveals that the lack
of correlation between θ and ϕ stems from the crossovers
moving out of plane, especially in the Sodium and Mixed simulations. However, in the case of the Magnesium simulation, more ϕ angles close to 180° can be observed
than in the other simulations, showing that Mg2+ ions allow
the DNA helices to run relatively straight and that they are less
influenced by the presence of crossover junctions. Collectively, these
results show that different ions do not affect the structural integrity
of the double helices at the time scale of our simulations but influence
the global origami structure via the conformations of crossovers and
repulsion of parallel helices.

Binding of Ions
The above results revealed the effect
of the distinct ions on conformational changes in the DNA origami
structure. To explain the observed structural differences, we subsequently
studied the preferential binding mechanisms of the distinct ions by
zooming in onto the interactions of the ions with individual nucleotides
and atoms in the DNA origami. First, we quantified preferential binding
positions on the DNA origami rectangle by time-averaging the number
of ions within 5 Å of every nucleotide. The results for the Magnesium and the Sodium simulations are
shown in Figure 3a
and those of the other simulations in Figures S8 and S9. In all cases, nucleotides at the edge of the origami
are observed to bind fewer ions compared to nucleotides in the center
of the rectangle, which can be explained by the lower density of negatively
charged phosphates at the edges compared to the center, especially
at crossover regions. Comparison of the Magnesium and Sodium simulations reveals a more homogeneous
distribution of ions over the origami in the latter. This indicates
that Na+ either has a lower preference for particular locations
in the origami, or that Na+ ions regularly unbind and bind
at other positions, or even diffuse over the surface without forming
specific interactions. Spm4+ and Mg2+ show the
highest number of charges near crossovers compared to the other ion
types. The PLL-10 and Spermine simulations
show a slight increase of ions near crossovers, but overall the ions
are more randomly distributed over the structure compared to the Magnesium simulation.

and all thymine nucleotides. (d) Superposition of 100 frames of a
crossover region in the Mixed simulation showing

Apart from differences in distribution of ions across the
DNA origami
nanostructure, we also observed differences in the lengths of the
time intervals for which ions reside within 12 Å of the origami.
These residence times (Figure 3b) are observed to be much shorter for Na+ compared
to other ions. Only two Na+ ions remain within 12 Å
of the DNA backbone over a time interval of 60 ns and longer. In contrast,
43 Mg2+ ions show residence times of at least the duration
of the entire simulation. For K10 and Spm4+,
the majority of charge centers remain near the DNA for the duration
of the simulation, consistent with the earlier global ion analysis,
which showed that almost all ions are localized near the origami at
any given moment in the simulation.

Na+ and Mg2+ are known to bind sequence-dependently
to the major and minor groove with a preference of Mg2+ for guanine and adenine in both major and minor grooves.60 Na+ has also been shown to bind preferentially
to thymine in the minor groove but to guanine and adenine in the major
groove.61 Though the origami structure
in our simulations differs significantly from the dodecamers used
in these studies and does not contain long AT or CG domains, we next
averaged the amount of ions within 5 Å of a nucleotide over all
nucleotides of the same type to analyze if base type dependent binding
of ions plays an important role in this DNA origami. For each nucleotide
type, we determined the average amount of ions or nitrogens near a
nucleotide (Table S2). These data reveal
that in all simulations, adenine and guanine are more subject to ion
binding, which can be explained by the higher number of atoms in these
bases. However, no further significant preferences for specific nucleotide
types were observed.

To investigate possible base type dependent
binding of the distinct
ions in more detail, we also quantified the average amount of ions
near each nucleotide type at the atomistic level. The results for
thymine bases in Figure 3c show that Mg2+ is often localized near the carbonyl
oxygen in the minor groove-side of the nucleotide and near backbone
atoms, while it is found very infrequently near other atoms in the
thymine base ring. Also for other nucleotides (see Figure S10), Mg2+ often appears to bind near minor-groove
atoms, mainly in adenine and guanine, and near backbone phosphates.
Na+ is also found frequently near minor-groove atoms, while
little binding is observed near the backbone or the major groove for
all nucleotides. For K10, penetration of amines into the
grooves of the DNA is relatively uncommon and while some minor groove
binding is observed, K10 mainly binds to the DNA backbone.
This is in agreement with a recent study that showed that K6 does not bind strongly to the major and minor groove, especially
in AT-rich regions.62 In the Spermine simulation, Spm4+ shows only little binding to phosphate
groups in the DNA backbone, and mainly binds to major groove atoms
in guanine. This sequence-dependency of Spm4+ binding has
also been observed by Yoo et al., who showed that the methyl group
in thymine prevents Spm4+ binding to the major groove in
AT-rich regions, while it does bind in the major groove of GC-rich
regions.36 For thymine and adenine, we
observe that Spm4+ binds in the minor groove instead and
through visual inspection we observe them in the regions in between
helices as well. This has previously been shown to cause a stronger
attraction between helices and has been referred to as the “bridging”
of Spm4+ molecules between DNA duplexes.36,53,63

To visualize the difference between
Mg2+ and Na+ binding, we aligned one crossover
junction over 100 frames
in the Mixed simulation. In Figure 3d, the crossover and the surrounding ions
over all 100 frames are shown. We observe clusters of Mg2+ at specific locations near the crossover in line with our previous
analysis. These are mainly Mg2+-ions with long residence
times, while Na+-ions are primarily scattered at larger
distances from the origami.

We further quantified the preferential
binding positions of ions
by determining the radial distribution functions (rdf) between ions
and DNA atoms in the minor groove, and between ions and phosphorus
atoms in the DNA backbone. For the minor groove-ion-rdf we considered
the carboxyl oxygen on thymine and cytosine bases and the hydrogen
of the secondary amine in guanine and adenine bases (Figure 4a). The highest peak of Mg2+ is located at the same distance as the highest Spm4+ peak at 4 Å, while the peak of Na+ is at a larger
distance of 5 Å. In contrast, the rdf for K10 fluctuates
around a value of 2 with less defined peaks, indicating that K10 does not bind close to minor groove atoms, corroborating
the results in Figures 3c and S10. In the phosphorus-ion-rdf (Figure 4b), the main peak
for Spm4+ at 6.5 Å indicates binding to the grooves,
with a smaller one at 4 Å indicating limited direct binding to
phosphates. Na+ and K10 display a peak at a
similar distance of 6 Å, while Mg2+ is typically closer
to phosphorus at 5.5 Å, which can be an effect of both a higher
charge and a smaller ionic radius.

Zoomed in simulation snapshots illustrating typical binding of Mg2+, K10, and Spm4+, respectively, with
DNA origami shown in gray, Mg2+ in red, K10 in
yellow, Spm4+ in green, and nitrogen in blue.

As analysis of preferential binding regions on the origami
suggested
that some ions bind close to crossover regions more frequently than
others, we also determined the rdfs between ions and phosphorus atoms
of the four nucleotides forming the crossovers. The integrals of these
rdfs (Figure 4c) clearly
show that mainly Mg2+ binds close to crossover phosphates.
Also, for Spm4+ approximately 50% more charge is located
within 10 Å of the crossover phosphates compared to K10 and Na+. K10 and Na+ bind at similar
distances further away from the crossover phosphates. This enhanced
charge compensation of crossover phosphates compared to other ions
explains for the improved ability of Mg2+ and Spm4+ to stabilize crossovers and retain the parallel conformation of
adjacent helices.

Together, these results reveal that Mg2+ binds closely
to the DNA origami and is more likely to bind specific locations near
crossovers, which has been shown to rigidify crossovers,64,65 whereas Na+ binds at a larger distance from the origami
and rapidly exchanges with the bulk solvent. Spm4+ binds
closely to the DNA origami grooves, aligning with the backbone phosphates
and shows, together with Mg2+ ions, the highest charge
compensation near crossovers, while K10 is able to stabilize
DNA origami without binding deeply in the grooves. Snapshots illustrating
typical binding of Mg2+, K10, and Spm4+ are shown in Figures 4d, e, and f, respectively. In these snapshots, Mg2+ is
seen bound in the DNA minor groove, as well as directly near phosphate
groups around a crossover, and Spm4+ bound in, and aligned
with, the minor groove. Spm4+, as mentioned before, is
also seen in between neighboring DNA helices, suggesting a mechanism
similar to the “bridging” model of DNA helix attraction.36,53,54,63 K10 reveals a mechanism where part of the peptide binds
to one helix and another part to a neighboring helix, effectively
spanning over DNA origami helices. Not only does this mechanism explain
for the high capability of K10 to stabilize DNA origami
but also for the experimentally observed aggregation of DNA origamis
in the presence of polylysines with more than 10 units,25 namely by simultaneously binding to helices
in different origamis.

DNA Origami Stabilization by K4
The observation
that K10 stabilizes DNA origami by simultaneously binding
adjacent DNA helices, while tetravalent Spm4+ does so by
binding closely in the DNA grooves and in between helices, reducing
strain on crossovers, triggered us to perform an additional simulation
with shorter oligolysines as counterions. For this simulation, denoted
as the PLL-4 simulation, we chose Kn molecules with n = 4 to maintain the same
charge per molecule as Spm4+ while retaining the molecular
structure of oligolysine. Visual inspection of the final configuration
(Figure 5a) shows a
larger deviation from the initial structure compared to both the PLL-10 and Spermine simulations. The edges
of the origami move outward, indicating that K4 is less
able to reduce the repulsive forces between backbone phosphates. This
is confirmed by the RMSD values for the DNA backbone (Figure S11), which are higher than those for
the PLL-10 and Spermine simulations.
Observing the crossover angles θ and ϕ, we find that both
have an increased probability toward angles of 90 deg compared to
the Spermine and PLL-10 simulations
(Figure S12), indicating that K4 does not stabilize crossovers efficiently. Radial distribution functions
reveal that K4 side chains bind closely to both the N3
and N7 nitrogens in the minor and major grooves, respectively (Figure 5c). On the level
of individual atoms (as in Figure 3c), we observe similar preferential binding as for
K10, but with an enhanced preference for the major groove
of guanine (see Figure S10). This is explained
by the presence of a carbonyl group at the major groove side of guanine,
which attracts K4 side chains more strongly to the major
groove compared to adenine. The larger size of K10 as opposed
to K4 causes side chains to be more constrained, reducing
their ability to reach into the guanine major groove to form more
favorable interactions. Typical binding of K4 to DNA origami
is shown in Figure 5b and shows that the methyl group in the major groove side of thymine
prevents binding to AT-rich regions.36 Also,
K4 amine side chains reach toward the major groove side
of guanine.

between nitrogens in K4 and minor groove atoms, major groove

inset indicates the minor (N3) and major (N7) groove atoms used in
the case of guanine.

To confirm if the typical
bridging behavior observed for K10 occurs to a lesser degree
for K4, we finally
quantified the fractions of molecules that bind to more than one helix
at the same time, where binding is again defined as one of the N atoms
in the counterion being within 5 Å of any DNA atom in that helix.
Averaged over time, 62% of the K10 molecules bind to two
helices. In contrast, only 24% of the K4 molecules bind
to more than one helix at the time, while for Spm4+ this
percentage is 23%. Despite its identical structure to K10 and its equal valency to Spm4+, K4 can thus
neither stabilize the DNA origami by aligning in the DNA grooves like
Spm4+ nor by spanning over helices like K10.

Conclusions
We have used atomistic MD simulations to analyze
the effect of
various ion types on a 512 bp DNA origami rectangle and the structure
of its crossovers. The high spatial-temporal resolution of these simulations
provides a molecular picture of DNA origami stabilization that cannot
be directly observed experimentally. Na+ has been shown
to bind only weakly to the DNA origami and to rapidly exchange with
the solvent, resulting in a too weak screening of the negative charges
on the DNA backbone to prevent repulsion of parallel helices and destabilization
of crossovers. In contrast, Mg2+ does not only bind to
the DNA origami to a higher extent, it also binds more closely and
resides at specific locations for extended periods of time, also at
crossovers. As a result, it stabilizes the origami by screening the
negative charges on the backbone more efficiently and maintaining
crossovers in an “H” conformation. Spm4+ molecules
condense even stronger on the DNA and bind especially closely in the
minor groove near thymine and adenine, and in the major groove near
guanine with long residence times as well as in between helices. Being
able to retain the parallel orientation of DNA helices more than the
other counterions, Spm4+ has an increased capability to
stabilize crossovers in “H” conformation. This correlates
with the prevention of repulsion between DNA helices, resulting in
condensation of helices and therefore a higher aspect ratio of the
origami compared to the other simulations. K10 molecules
show the longest residence times near the origami and bind directly
to the backbone rather than penetrating the DNA grooves and keep helices
together by simultaneous binding of adjacent helices with its flexible
side chains, in this way spanning parallel helices. We thus reveal
two main mechanisms of DNA origami stabilization: (i) binding of high
charge density ions like Mg2+ and Spm4+ stabilizes
crossovers and reduces repulsion of parallel helices and (ii) binding
of long flexible ions like K10 that interconnect adjacent
helices by simultaneous binding of different parts of the ion. A simulation
with K4, that is, a counterion with the same valency as
Spm4+ and the same molecular structure as K10 but that is too short to span multiple DNA helices and does not
have the high charge density of Spm4+, showed that K4 is indeed a weaker stabilizer than both K10 and
Spm4+, though still stronger than Na+. Altogether,
this shows that ions can stabilize DNA origami via distinct mechanisms
and that for stabilization either a higher number of weakly binding
amines like in K10 or a smaller but stronger binding molecule
like Spm4+ or Mg2+ is required.

Combining
both strategies, that is, preventing helix repulsion
and simultaneously binding adjacent helices, by using mixtures of
ion types could lead to enhanced stabilization of DNA nanostructures.
For instance, while K10, Spm4+, and Mg2+ have been shown to be efficient stabilizers for the DNA origami
nanostructure used in our simulations, K10 may not be able
to stabilize larger three-dimensional designs as it is too large to
penetrate the structure and neutralize the inner regions of the nanostructure.
In this case, optimal stabilization might be obtained by a combination
of smaller ions, for example, Mg2+ or spermine with a K10 coating on the outside of the DNA nanostructure. Another
interesting avenue would be to consider another ion type that integrates
both stabilization mechanisms. A promising example in this respect
may be a second-generation polypropyleneimine dendrimer, a molecule
with structural similarity to Spm4+ that approaches the
length of K10 in its fully extended conformation. In addition,
given the apparent importance of high charge density of ions to stabilize
crossovers, a third interesting avenue would be the investigation
of other compact multivalent ions that have been studied in the context
of DNA, for example, cobalt hexammine.31,53 Though further
computational and experimental work is required to determine if such
mixtures of ions, dendrimers or other high charge density cations
are indeed able to more efficiently stabilize DNA origami, the simulations
presented here already shed light on the binding mechanisms of Mg2+, Na+, K10, Spm4+, and K4 to DNA origami at an atomistic level and showed their modes
of stabilization. Understanding of these mechanisms of stabilization
is an important prerequisite to open up the biomedical applicability
of these versatile nanostructures.

Methods
Simulation
Setup
The origami rectangle was designed
using caDNAno66 and subsequently converted
into an atomistic representation using a tool developed by Aksimentiev
et al.38,67 This atomistic representation of the DNA
origami rectangle was dissolved in aqueous solutions containing different
ions: Na+, a mix of Na+ and Mg2+,
Mg2+, K10, Spm4+, and K4, termed the Sodium, Mixed, Magnesium, PLL-10, Spermine, and PLL-4 simulation, respectively. For the Magnesium, Mixed, and Sodium simulations, the DNA origami structure was first solvated in TIP3P
water68 using VMD’s69 solvate tool in a simulation box with dimensions 250 ×
70 × 270 Å3. Subsequently, using the ionize tool
in VMD,69 random water molecules were replaced
with Mg2+ or Na+ to neutralize the system and
with additional ions to reach excess ion concentrations of 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM NaCl or 20 mM NaCl in the Magnesium, Mixed, or Sodium simulation, respectively. For the PLL-10, Spermine, and PLL-4 simulations, first
100 K10, 250 Spm4+, and 250 K4 molecules,
respectively, were added to the system using a custom Python script
to reach a nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P)-ratio of approximately 1:1. After
solvation with TIP3P water in a simulation box with dimensions 250
× 70 × 270 Å3, random water molecules were
replaced with Na+ and Cl– to reach the
same amount of added positive and negative charges in the system as
in the other simulations (see Table S1 for
details).

Simulation Protocol
The simulation protocol is largely
based on the protocol used by Yoo and Aksimentiev.38 All simulations were performed using NAMD70 with periodic boundary conditions, the CHARMM36 force field
optimized for DNA71 with improved parameters
for ions72 and polyamines,73 1–4 nonbonded exclusions, a 10–12 Å
switching scheme for nonbonded interactions, and electrostatic interactions
treated using a particle-mesh Ewald scheme with a grid spacing of
1 Å. In the molecular dynamics simulations, temperature was controlled
using a Langevin thermostat,70 and pressure
was controlled at one bar using a Nosé–Hoover barostat.74

First, we perform an equilibration protocol.
The first step of this protocol comprised 104 steps of
energy minimization while keeping the positions of all DNA origami
backbone atoms fixed. To ascertain that in the simulations containing
Mg2+, magnesium hexahydrates were formed, we restrained
the six water oxygen atoms closest to each Mg2+ ion using
harmonic restraints with an equilibrium distance of 1.94 Å and
a force constant of 1 kcal/mol/Å2, and performed an
additional short minimization to let the system adjust to these restraints.
The second step of the equilibration protocol comprised a short NVT
molecular dynamics run in which the temperature is increased in a
stepwise fashion from 0 to 295 K. To give the ions a more random orientation
with respect to the starting structure in the PLL-10, Spermine, and PLL-4 simulations,
an NPT run of 0.5–1.5 ns was performed where for each polyamine
one atom at its center was kept fixed. The next step of the equilibration
protocol comprised an NPT run of 3–4 ns where all ions could
freely diffuse toward the origami of which the backbone was still
restrained. In these runs a high piston period of 1000 fs was used
to prevent the simulation from crashing. Then, for all simulations
we released the DNA origami and the hexahydrate restraints and performed
another short minimization and NVT run. Finally, we started the 100
ns production run in an NPT ensemble at a temperature of 298 K and
a pressure of one bar with a piston period of 200 fs. Simulations
were performed partly on our local computing cluster, but mainly on
Cartesius, the Dutch national supercomputer.

Analysis
All analyses
were performed using in-house
developed Python scripts, which made use of the MDAnalysis module
to read in trajectory files and perform atom selections.75 Radial distribution functions were computed
using VMD’s built-in analysis tool.76
