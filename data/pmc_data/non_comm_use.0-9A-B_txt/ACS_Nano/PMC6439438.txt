Biomaterial
substrates can be engineered to present topographical
signals to cells which, through interactions between the material
and active components of the cell membrane, regulate key cellular
processes and guide cell fate decisions. However, targeting mechanoresponsive
elements that reside within the intracellular domain is a concept
that has only recently emerged. Here, we show that mesoporous silicon
nanoneedle arrays interact simultaneously with the cell membrane,
cytoskeleton, and nucleus of primary human cells, generating distinct
responses at each of these cellular compartments. Specifically, nanoneedles
inhibit focal adhesion maturation at the membrane, reduce tension
in the cytoskeleton, and lead to remodeling of the nuclear envelope
at sites of impingement. The combined changes in actin cytoskeleton
assembly, expression and segregation of the nuclear lamina, and localization
of Yes-associated protein (YAP) correlate differently from what is
canonically observed upon stimulation at the cell membrane, revealing
that biophysical cues directed to the intracellular space can generate
heretofore unobserved mechanosensory responses. These findings highlight
the ability of nanoneedles to study and direct the phenotype of large
cell populations simultaneously, through biophysical interactions
with multiple mechanoresponsive components.

Physical
cues from the extracellular
space are sensed at the cell membrane and initiate intracellular signaling
cascades that ultimately influence cell fate and function.1−5 The rational design of materials that are employed as culture substrates
enables investigation of how cells respond to physicochemical stimuli
from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Indeed, cues such as substrate
stiffness,3 micro/nanotopograhy,4 and spatial confinement6 can influence crucial cell functions, including regulation of gene
expression programs, proliferation, and lineage specification.7 Due to the physical connection of the cell membrane
to intracellular mechanoresponsive elements, forces generated at the
cell–material interface can alter organelle structure and function,
such as nuclear morphology, chromatin organization, and epigenetic
status.5−12 However, most engineered materials interface exclusively with the
cell membrane, and their effects on cell organelles—such as
the cytoskeleton or the nucleus—are the consequence of stimuli
originating from interactions at the membrane. Therefore, the influence
of materials on the intracellular space can be considered indirect
and is mediated by established mechanosensory signal transduction
cascades. One central theme of these canonical pathways is the spatial
regulation of the mechanoresponsive cofactors, Yes-associated protein
(YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ),
which is mediated, in part, via the actomyosin contractile
machinery.7 Several material systems have
investigated how YAP/TAZ and cytoskeletal tension are influenced by
changing physicochemical parameters,7,13−16 adding to literature that has provided exhaustive insight into how
intracellular elements are affected by outside-in, canonical mechanosensing.17−23 In contrast, techniques such as micropipette aspiration,24 optical/magnetic tweezers,25 and atomic force microscopy26 have been used to directly probe individual organelles without relying
upon material-derived cues, demonstrating that direct interaction
with mechanosensitive organelles can induce changes in cell behaviors.
However, their low throughput and complex setups limit their investigational
and translational potential in more advanced tissue and in
vivo models. The development of material systems to directly
probe organelles within multiple cells simultaneously can enable the
study of membrane-independent mechanosensing pathways within large
and complex biological systems such as organotypic cultures and tissues,
thus improving strategies for the modulation of cell behavior.

Arrays of high aspect ratio, vertically oriented nanostructures
have recently garnered tremendous attention for their interactions
with the intracellular component of cells in culture and tissues.
These materials can deliver membrane-impermeant cargo to the cytosol,27−34 sense enzymatic activity,35,36 and stimulate/record
electrical activity from within the cell.37,38 Importantly, interfacing these nanomaterials with cells does not
noticeably alter their viability or metabolic activity, although it
has a strong impact on mechanoresponsive elements within the cell.
For example, cells on nanowires exhibit fewer adhesive structures2,39−42 and reduced cytoskeletal tension,2,15,17 alongside alterations to cellular8,29,43−50 and nuclear morphology.8,51 Although these observations
have generated a wealth of understanding about the membrane-initiated
response to nanowires, there remains an unmet need to understand the
nature of the interactions between nanomaterials and the intracellular
space, as well as how these events influence mechanosensory pathways.

To this end, we investigated the molecular and functional consequences
of the interaction between porous silicon nanoneedles (nN) and specific
mechanosensitive organelles in primary human cells and report canonical
mechanosensing events alongside noncanonical responses of organelles
to nanomaterial cues. We first show that interfacing porous silicon
nN with cells prevents the formation and maturation of focal adhesions
(FAs) at the cell–material interface, which leads to decreased
cytoskeletal tension and reduced functional activity of mechanoresponsive
transcriptional regulators. However, nN also induce a separate physical
response in intracellular organelles: specifically, the actin cytoskeleton
forms dense rings at sites of nN engagement, and the nuclear envelope
undergoes type-specific remodeling of lamin A/C but not lamin B. Importantly,
these processes are not dependent on intact actomyosin contractile
machinery. Furthermore, nN induce a decoupling of YAP localization/activation
and cell area, as well as physical segregation of lamin A at inward
nuclear protrusions. The findings reported here reveal that porous
silicon nN are a powerful tool to target intracellular organelles
in multiple cells simultaneously and offer insight into the relationships
between various mechanoresponsive cellular elements.

Results
Quantitative
Morphometric Analysis
Human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)
cultured on nN arrays for 6 h displayed extensive morphological alterations,
as compared to the flat substrate controls (Figure 1A,B). Cells interacted directly with the
nN (Figure 1A), which
had a profound effect on the morphology of the entire cell population
(Figure 1B). Importantly,
most cells sunk into the sharp nN arrays and were not suspended on
top of the structures (Figure S1). Using
automated processing of immunofluorescence images, we performed quantitative
morphometric analysis to extract and quantify the cellular features
that were most heavily influenced by culture on nN substrates (Figures 1C and S2). Twenty-five features of cell morphology
and actin textures were subsequently compared by linear discriminant
analysis (LDA), which revealed that actin homogeneity, a measure of
fiber size, reduced greatly on nN whereas protrusions extended farther
radially from the nucleus (Figure 1D,E). Indeed, when compared to their respective flat
controls, both cell types demonstrated a significant reduction in
actin stress fiber density (Figure 1F), along with a greater number of high aspect ratio
protrusions (Figure 1G,H). HUVECs also displayed an increased ratio of cortical-to-central
actin on nN (Figure 1I), and the protrusions of hMSCs were aligned along the nN array,
indicating that nN can guide protrusion formation (Figure 1J). Despite these significant
morphological changes, culture on nN did not abolish cell proliferation,
compromise the integrity of the nuclear envelope, or stimulate an
apoptotic response, as indicated by positive staining for Ki67 (Figure S3), nuclear retention of heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP, Figure S4), and negative staining for caspase-3, respectively (Figure S5).

Reduced Focal Adhesion Formation and Actomyosin
Contractility
Such a significant morphological response to
biophysical cues suggests
a direct effect of nN on the mechanosensing cell machinery. Indeed,
whereas both cell types formed dense FAs on flat substrates, smaller,
more diffuse FAs appeared on nN (Figure 2A,B and Figure S6), and gene- and protein-level expression of vinculin was decreased
(Figure 2C,D). The
reduction in phosphorylated paxillin (pPax) on nN confirmed the limited
maturation of FAs (Figure 2A). Cells on flat substrates demonstrated dense paxillin staining,
as expected for a planar substrate upon which cells can readily form
FAs and spread; however, cells on nN exhibited unordered staining
patterns for both actin and paxillin (Figure S6A). Gene-level expression of multiple FA components, including focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin (PAX), vinculin (VCL), and zyxin (ZYX), was significantly downregulated on nN (Figure 2C), and the expression of various integrins
trended downward, with integrin β1 showing a significant reduction
for both cell types on nN (Figure S7).
Staining specific for phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC), which
indicates active actomyosin contractility, was also significantly
reduced for both cell types cultured on nN (Figure 2A,E), suggesting that hampered maturation
of FAs on nN leads to attenuated intracellular tension.

inhibit focal adhesion formation and generation of
intracellular tension. (A) Confocal maximum projection images 6 h
postseeding. On flat substrates, dense vinculin staining is observed
in stable focal adhesion (FA) complexes. Strong phosphorylated paxillin
(pPax) and phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) signal on flat
substrates indicate FA maturation and active actomyosin contractile
machinery, respectively. Cells on nN display diffuse vinculin staining
and severely reduced pPax and pMLC signal. Scale bars: vinculin =
25 μm; pPax and pMLC = 50 μm. (B) Significant reduction
in vinculin signal reveals reduced FA density on nN (box plots, minimum/maximum; N = 3). (C) qPCR indicates that culture on nN yields downregulation
in gene expression for multiple FA components (focal adhesion kinase

(VCL), and zyxin (ZYX); qPCR, N = 3, mean ± SD). (D) Western blot shows downregulation
of vinculin protein expression on nN (HUVEC: N =

of pMLC signal intensity via image analysis confirms
a significant reduction for both cell types cultured on nN, as compared
to their respective controls (box plots, minimum/maximum, N ≥ 4); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 between groups
as indicated by the lines.

Modulation of YAP Localization and Function
Biophysical
stimuli regulate the functionality of the transcription cofactors
YAP and TAZ.7 When cytoskeletal tension
can be generated, YAP and TAZ localize within the nucleus, activating
their transcriptional program. However, when tension is interrupted,
the cofactors are localized in the cytosol and their activity is reduced.7 The nuclear/cytosolic YAP ratio decreased on
nN for both cell types (Figure 3A,B), and expression of the YAP target genes ankyrin repeat
domain 1 (ANKRD1) and connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF) was significantly decreased (Figure 3C), indicating reduced functional
YAP activity in cells cultured on nN compared to those cultured on
flat surfaces. On flat substrates, cell area correlated highly with
YAP nuclear/cytosolic ratio (HUVEC: ρ = 0.592; hMSC: ρ
= 0.465), but on nN, this correlation was notably lower (HUVEC: ρ
= 0.184; hMSC: ρ = 0.263; Fisher’s R-to-Z transformation,
HUVEC: p < 0.001; hMSC: p = 0.0183; Figure 3D). Taken together,
these data demonstrate that nN induce cell spreading but uncouple
changes in cell geometry from YAP activation.

Figure 3 Nanoneedles reduce YAP
activity and lessen the correlation between
YAP activation and cell spreading. (A) Confocal microscopy shows nuclear
YAP protein localization on flat substrates and cytosolic localization
on nN (green: YAP). Scale bars = 50 μm. (B) Image analysis quantification
of YAP localization shows significant reduction in the nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio of YAP on nN (minimum/maximum; N = 4). (C) qPCR analysis indicates reduced expression of the YAP
target genes ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1) and
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (N = 4, mean ± SD). (D) Cell spread area and YAP nuclear localization
correlate tightly on flat substrates, but correlation is weakened
on nN (N = 3). (E) YAP localization following cell
treatment with either the actin depolymerizing agent, LatB, or a small
molecule to stimulate actin bundling, LPA. LatB treatment on flat
substrates reduces nuclear YAP localization to levels comparable to
untreated cells on nN. LatB treatment of cells on nN yields a small
reduction in nuclear localization. LPA treatment on flat substrates
did not affect YAP localization for HUVECs and marginally decreased
this metric for hMSCs. On nN substrates, LPA had little effect on
YAP localization. (minimum/maximum; N = 3); *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 between groups as indicated by the lines.

To determine if the loss of actin
polymerization and/or actomyosin
contractility underpinned decreased YAP nuclear translocation in cells
plated on nN, we inhibited actin polymerization using latrunculin
B (LatB) or upregulated actomyosin contractility by treating cells
with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA).17 LatB
treatment on nN further reduced the YAP ratio, although marginally
(Figure 3E), whereas
the YAP ratio of LatB-treated cells on flat control substrates was
significantly reduced to levels comparable to those of untreated cells
on nN. When cells were treated with LPA, the YAP ratio for cells on
nN was not recovered back to levels observed for untreated or LPA-treated
cells on flat control substrates, indicating that upregulation of
signaling (biochemical) pathways that promote contractility and YAP
activation on flat substrates is insufficient to promote YAP activity
on nN. These data suggest that manipulation of actin polymerization
and actomyosin contractility in cells on nN has only modest effects
on YAP activity. Taken together, our data suggest that FA formation
and/or turnover, and not changes in cell shape or actin organization,
appears to be a principal driver of YAP activation.

Interaction
with Mechanosensory Organelles
Interfacing
of cells with nN also stimulated a physical response by the cytoskeleton
and the nuclear envelope at sites of engagement (Figure 4). Analysis of morphometric
parameters from whole populations on nN indicated actin homogeneity
to be the most heavily influenced cell feature among those measured
(Figure 1E). Indeed,
dense actin rings formed at sites of nN interaction in both cell types
(Figure 4A) at various
heights along the nN, exhibiting a dynamic and short-lived nature
(Supplementary Video 1). Strikingly, cells
treated with LatB during the entire culture period still formed actin
rings (Figure 4B),
indicating that intact actomyosin contractility is not required for
cytoskeletal structures to respond to nN. These data further support
the idea that YAP nuclear translocation dynamics are not directly
coupled to changes in actin polymerization.

values of lamin A and lamin B at the middle and top of nN. At sites
of nuclear remodeling (i.e. lamin A/lamin B >
1)
the A/B ratio increases exponentially along the nN axis (R2 = 0.808, n = 69 nN sites, n = 14 cells, N = 3). (H) qPCR analysis of nuclear
lamina components shows increased LMNA but not LMNB expression on nN after 6 h in culture. (N = 4, mean ± SD). (I) Western blot and (J) analysis relative
to GAPDH control reveal a decrease in protein-level lamin A after
6 h in culture. (K) Quantification of signal intensity for lamin A
relative to lamin B images further confirm that a reduction in lamin
A occurs following culture on nN substrates (N =
3 experiments); ***p < 0.001 between groups as
indicated by the lines.

At the nucleus, nN physically displaced DNA at sites of engagement,
as evidenced by areas where DAPI signal was absent (Figure 4C). In order to understand
how the nN specifically interacted with the nuclear envelope, we analyzed
the expression and localization of A- and B-type lamins, the intermediate
filaments that provide structural integrity to the nuclear envelope.5 Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy
(3D SIM) showed intense lamin A signal at sites where nN impinged
on the nucleus (Figure S9 and Supplementary Video 2). Of note, lamin remodeling
was not observed at all nN sites (24% of hMSCs and 37% of HUVECs demonstrated
remodeled nuclei), but where remodeling was evident, lamin A accumulated
at the nN whereas lamin B remained equally distributed throughout
the nuclear membrane (Figure 4D). Fold changes in lamin A and B signal along nuclear envelope
as it wrapped around the nN were quantified using resliced x–z confocal images normalized to
the nuclear membrane signal measured at non-nN locations (Figure 4E–G). At sites
of remodeling, lamin A signal more than doubled on average and increased
up to 4-fold relative to non-nN sites, whereas lamin B signal was
mostly unchanged (Figure 4F), indicating that nN stimulate a dynamic response of lamin
A, but not lamin B, that results in a segregation of the two nuclear
envelope components. Furthermore, where remodeling occurred, the lamin
A/B ratio increased exponentially toward the nN tip (Figure 4G). We further stained for
the lamin A/C–C epitope, which is only accessible when the
protein is not under tension,8 and found
this to be located at the tips of the needles (Figure S10). This pattern of lamin A accumulation and relaxation
suggests a local force application at the tip that remodels the nuclear
membrane (Figure S11).

Increases
in lamin A protein, such as those that occur during culture
on matrices of high stiffness, can lead to upregulation of LMNA mRNA through the engagement of positive feedback loops.5 We thus set out to determine how displacement
of lamin A protein from the nuclear envelope affects LMNA expression. The relative gene-level expression of lamin A (LMNA) increased for both cell types on nN, as compared to
their respective flat control, whereas lamin B (LMNB) expression did not change (Figure 4H). Expression of the linker of nucleoskeleton and
cytoskeleton (LINC) complex members, Nesprin-2 (SYNE2) and SUN2 (SUN2), was also unchanged
(Figure S8). Western blot protein-level
expression analysis showed an overall lamin A decrease on nN (Figure 4I,J), which was confirmed
by quantitative image analysis of lamin A- and lamin B-stained cells
(Figure 4K). Thus,
displacement and destabilisation of lamin A by nN results in an upregulation
of LMNA mRNA.

Recovery upon Nanoneedle
Degradation
After 48 h in
culture, nN were mostly degraded (Figure 5A) and cells recovered the characteristics
observed on flat control substrates (Figure 5B). Specifically, actin stress fibers and
vinculin-dense FAs were present at 48 h, and the ratio of nuclear/cytosolic
YAP partially recovered (Figure 5C). The density of FAs on nN at 48 h, as indicated
by vinculin staining, was similar to what was measured on flat control
samples at 6 h (Figure 5D). Furthermore, 48 h post-nN interfacing, actin rings were not observed
and lamin A remodeling of the nucleus was absent at sites of nN engagement
(Figure 5B), indicating
that direct nN interaction with organelles had been lost. The mechanoresponsive
characteristics at 48 h therefore are similar to culture on a flat
substrate with mature FA, engaged actomyosin machinery and restored
nuclear envelope morphology (Figure 5E).

Figure 5 Nanoneedle degradation recovers mechanoresponsive cell
behaviors.

a partial return of YAP localization to the nucleus and (D) increased

Schematic representation of the cell−nN interaction. Cells
on flat substrates display firm focal adhesions, which allow for generation
of intracellular tension, yielding YAP nuclear localization and subsequent
transcriptional activity, and a uniform nuclear lamina composition.
nN interfacing limits focal adhesion formation and maturation, directly
stimulates actin ring formation, and results in segregation of lamin
A and B at the nucleus. Furthermore, lamin A is downregulated at the
protein level but upregulated at the gene level in response to interactions
with nN.

Discussion
In
the present study, we have demonstrated
that nN interfacing simultaneously stimulates different mechanoresponsive
organelles within primary human cells, inducing both canonical responses
that arise from interactions at the membrane–material interface,
as well as unreported mechanosensing events arising from interactions
with the intracellular space. The degree of response to nN stimuli
can differ across cell types, particularly at the cytoskeletal level
(Figure 1G–J).
Yet, the key features of this biophysical interaction, namely, the
regulation of YAP and lamin A localization, FA interruption and actin
accumulation, are preserved across cell types. Thus, despite the two
cell types being inherently different (i.e., mesenchymal vs endothelial), our data suggest that conserved pathways
drive the response to nN stimulation.

Uncoupling the mechanotransduction
of stimuli that regulate cell contractility (i.e., mechanical cues) from those that regulate cell shape and spreading
(i.e., geometric cues) using materials has historically
been challenging as many engineered substrates modulate both simultaneously.12 Here, we show that nN greatly weaken the frequently
observed correlation between cell area and YAP localization (Figure 3D), which has been
established largely in cells cultured on flat substrates or micropillars.6 This finding indicates that geometric cues which
increase cell spreading alone are insufficient to promote YAP activation
on nN, suggesting that YAP activity might primarily be regulated by
mechanical cues such as FA density on nN.

In addition to interactions
with the membrane and actin network,
nN also engaged with the nucleus and displaced the nuclear envelope,
stimulating a dynamic remodeling process of A-type, but not B-type,
lamin proteins (Figure 4). In structural models of the nuclear envelope, lamin A exhibits
a viscous response to resist deformation whereas lamin B is an elastic
component that preserves nuclear shape.5 Indeed, lamin A is required to prevent nuclear envelope rupture
in the presence of external forces both in isolated nuclei25 and intact cells,24 and lamin A expression scales with tissue stiffness5 in order to protect the sensitive nuclear components from
external pressures. In our system, lamin A, but not lamin B, responded
to the mechanical stimulus by accumulating at nN sites, particularly
showing a preferential accumulation at the nN tip, where the negative
membrane curvature is strongest (Figure 4F). This agrees with the established protective
role of A-type lamins in counteracting mechanical insults to the sensitive
intranuclear cargo. Yet, lamin A protein levels decreased on nN, whereas
gene expression increased (Figure 4). These data, together with the exposure of epitopes
associated with relaxed lamin A (Figure S10), suggest that the nuclear envelope is under reduced tension at
the sites of nN-nucleus engagement, leading to lamin A phosphorylation
and degradation.52 Further, in contrast
with previous reports showing that actomyosin contractility is necessary
for nuclear envelope remodeling on nanopillars,8 we observe that lamin A remodeling still occurs in LatB-treated
cells (Figure S12).

Lamin A and YAP
localization tend to correlate in vitro when matrix
rigidity is altered, until an overabundance of lamin
A for very stiff substrates can prevent further nuclear YAP translocation.5 Instead, nN induce cytosolic YAP concomitantly
with increased lamin A gene expression, providing insight into the
complex relationship between the two factors (Figure S13). Material systems that simultaneously promote
lamin A expression and cytosolic YAP localization have been absent
in the literature, namely, because soft substrates that prevent nuclear
accumulation of YAP also result in wrinkled nuclei with highly phosphorylated,
inactive lamin A.7,52 By providing a platform for modulating
multiple mechanoresponsive elements simultaneously, nN represent a
useful tool for helping to deconstruct the YAP–lamin relationship.
Adipogenic differentiation of stem cells on soft matrices is enhanced
by low levels of lamin A and cytosolic YAP, whereas osteogenic differentiation
on stiff matrices is heightened by high levels of lamin A and nuclear
YAP.5,7 Due to their noncanonical regulation of
lamin A and YAP, nN can expand the toolset to potentially direct cell
fate and to improve our understanding of the role of biophysical cues
in determining stem cell lineage.

The degradation of nN at 48
h in culture recovered the phenotype
that was observed on flat substrates (Figure 5), highlighting the role of the physical
nanofeatures in driving changes in mechanoresponsive organelles.

Conclusions
The data presented here highlight the ability
of high aspect ratio
nanostructures to mechanically stimulate remodeling of organelles
in a reversible manner without loss of cell integrity. Further engineering
of these nanostructures to modulate the cell’s response can
be leveraged to induce isolated mechanosensory responses at the organelle
level, to enable finer material-induced control over cell fate in
tissue engineering.

Methods
Fabrication
of Nanoneedles
Nanoneedles were fabricated
according to our established protocol28,35 on 100 mm
diameter p-type doped Si wafers with 0.01 Ω·cm resistivity.
A 1200 Å film of low stress silicon nitride was deposited by
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (Scottish Microelectronics
Centre, UK). With an MA6 mask aligner (Suss Microtech, Germany), a
pattern consisting of 0.6 μm dots with 2 μm pitch was
transferred into a layer of NR9-250P photoresist (Futurrex, USA) spin-coated
on the substrate. The pattern was transferred into the low stress
nitride film with a 2 min 30 s reactive ion etching in CF4 gas in an Oxford NGP80 (20 sccm, 200 W, 100 mTorr, Oxford Instruments,
UK). The native oxide layer was stripped by soaking for 2 min in 10%
v/v HF solution. The substrate was rapidly transferred in a 10% v/v
HF solution of 0.02 M AgNO3 and incubated for 2 min for
electroless deposition of Ag nanoparticles. The substrate was transferred
to a 10% v/v HF solution containing 0.12 M H2O2 to undergo metal-assisted chemical etching for 8 min 30 s, forming
porous pillar structures. The substrate was washed repeatedly in water
and dried under N2 stream. Reactive ion etching in SF6 gas for 2 min 30 s (20 sccm, 100 mTorr, 250 W, Oxford NGP80)
formed the final conical nN structures. The wafer was diced into 8
× 8 mm dies for subsequent use (DISCO Technologies, Japan). The
typical nN had 3–4 μm length, a base diameter of 600
nm, and an apical diameter below 100 nm.

Preparation of Substrates
Samples were prepared as
previously described. Substrate surfaces were activated using an oxygen
plasma cleaner (10 min, Plasma Prep 5, Gala Instrumente, Germany)
and then functionalized with 3-aminotriethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich,
A3648) by liquid-phase conjugation in an ethanoic solution of 2% v/v
APTES for 2 h. Following repeat washes in absolute ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich
32221), the nN arrays were dried under nitrogen. To generate fluorescent
substrates, 0.0005% w/v 5 carboxytetramethylrhodamine N-succinimidyl ester (TAMRA, Sigma-Aldrich 53048) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) or 0.05 mg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (Sigma-Aldrich
F7250) in PBS was conjugated to the APTES amine group with 2 h incubation
followed by repeated washes with PBS and water. Nonfluorescent samples
were sterilized under UV light for at least 20 min prior to cell experiments.

Cell Culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs, Lonza) were expanded and seeded in endothelial growth medium-2
(EGM-2, Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
hMSCs were used between passages 4 and 6, and HUVECs were used between
passages 5 and 10. For 6 h experiments, hMSCs were seeded at a density
of 20 000 viable cells/cm2 and HUVECs were seeded
at a density of 30 000 viable cells/cm2, as determined
by Trypan Blue exclusion. For 48 h experiments, hMSCs and HUVECs were
seeded at different densities on flat and nN substrates to avoid confluent
overgrowth. For hMSCs, cells were seeded at 2500 and 8375 cells/cm2 for flat and nN substrates, respectively. For HUVECs, cells
were seeded at 3000 and 12 500 cells/cm2 for flat
and nN substrates, respectively.

Human mesenchymal stem cells
(hMSCs, Lonza Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) were expanded in serum-free,
chemically defined medium (MSCGM-CD) with supplements (TheraPEAK,
Lonza), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. When ∼80%
confluent, hMSCs were detached with 0.05% v/v trypsin-EDTA, reseeded
at a density of 100–500 cell/cm2, and cultured for
7–14 days before reaching confluence. For interfacing with
nN or flat substrates, hMSCs were seeded in minimum essential medium
alpha (αMEM, Gibco ThermoFisher Scientific, Paisley, United
Kingdom) with 10% v/v MSC-qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco)
and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco).

Latrunculin
B, Lysophosphatidic Acid, and Staurosporine Treatment
For
treatment with Latrunculin B (LatB) or lysophosphaticid acid
(LPA), cells were cultured for 5 h on flat or nN substrates, and then
the medium was changed to include either dimethyl sulfoxide control
(DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:10000), LatB (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:10000 in DMSO,
100 nM final concentration), or LPA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500,
10 μm final concentration). Cells were then cultured for 1 h
in the treated condition before end point experiments.

For treatment
with staurosporine, cells were cultured for the entire 6 h time course
in either DMSO (1:10000) or staurosporine (Abcam 120056, in 1:10000
DMSO, final concentration 1 μM). After 6 h, cells were treated
with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-555, ThermoFisher W32464,
1:200) and CellEvent caspase-3/7 green detection reagent (ThermoFisher
C10423, 4 μM) in PBS with 5% v/v FBS for 30 min. Cells were
then fixed with 3.7% w/v PFA, washed twice with PBS, and fluorescent
images were captured to detect caspase activity.

Immunocytochemistry
and Imaging
Cells were fixed in
3.7% w/v paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 15 min at
room temperature, then washed twice with PBS. For treatment with the
cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (CSK, vinculin images), cells were
incubated with CSK (10 mM PIPES, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose, 0.5% v/v Triton-X 100) for 1 min at 4 °C prior
to fixation, following an established protocol.53 Cells were then permeabilized with 0.25% v/v Triton X (Sigma-Aldich)
for 10 min and blocked with 5% v/v donkey serum for 1–2 h.
Primary antibodies were diluted in fresh 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin
(BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and added to the cells overnight at 4
°C. Samples were then washed three times with PBS for 5 min before
being incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500) in 0.1% w/v BSA
for 60–90 min at room temperature; cells were then washed three
more times with PBS for 5 min. Where applicable, samples were incubated
with AlexaFluor-conjugated phalloidin (1:100–1:200 in 0.1%
w/v BSA) for 1 h. All samples were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000,
1 μg/mL final concentration) for 5 min and stored upside down
in Vectashield (H-1000 Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom)
in glass-bottom chamber slides for imaging (Nunc, ThermoFisher Scientific).
Antibody information is listed in Supplementary Table 1. Confocal imaging was performed on a Leica SP5 microscope
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzler, Germany), and z-stacks were collected
with a 63× 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective lens at 700 nm step
size and with a pixel size of 240 nm. Wide-field imaging was performed
with an Axio Observer automated microscope (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena,
Germany) with a 20× 0.8 NA dry objective and a pixel size of
240 nm imaged at 16 bits per pixel (Hamamatsu Flash4 sCMOS). 3D structured
illumination microscopy (3D SIM) imaging was performed at room temperature
with an Elyra PS.1 (Carl Zeiss). A 63× 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective
lens was used, with three orientation angles of the excitation grid
and five phases acquired for each image with a 110 nm z-step and a
pixel size of 32 nm imaged at 16 bits per pixel on an Andor Zyla.
SIM processing was performed with the SIM module of the Zen software
package (Carl Zeiss), then TIF stacks of processed SIM data were exported.
The SIM data sets were then turned into projection images using ImageJ
software.

Live Cell Imaging
HUVECs were seeded in 35 mm plates
for next day 70% confluency (100 k/cm2). A ratio of 3:1
FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, E2311)/DNA (Lifeact plasmid)
with 1 μg of DNA was made up in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium,
GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, 51985-026), and 100 μL was added
to the cells in EBM-2 basal medium (Lonza CC-3156) with 2% FBS. After
6 h, the medium was replaced with EGM. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were trypsinized and seeded on the nN in 24-well plates at a
seeding density determined by the transfection efficiency. Following
2 h of incubation, to allow adherence of cell to the nN, the nN were
inverted and placed down in an 8-well chamber slide containing EGM
media and imaged on a wide-field Ti-E Eclipse microscope (Nikon-Minato,
Japan) with a 20× 0.8 NA dry objective. The cells were imaged
every 15 min for 2 h and 45 min with z-stacks of 5 μm range
and 500 nm spacing.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
(qRT-PCR)
Cells on nN or flat substrates were incubated with
Trizol reagent
(Life Technologies), mixed with chloroform (5:1 Trizol/chloroform),
and separated by centrifugation (12 000g,
15 min, 4 °C). The RNA contained within the aqueous phase was
then isolated with RNeasy columns (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, product #4368814), and qRT-PCR
was performed with a SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies, product #1179401K) with 2–5 ng of cDNA and 250–500
nM each of forward and reverse primers, using either a StepOne Plus
or QuantStudio6 machine (Applied Biosystems). The qRT-PCR protocol
was slightly different for the two machines. For the StepOne Plus,
the protocol included the following: 95 °C for 20 s followed
by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 3 s and annealing at
a temperature between 55 and 60 °C for 30 s. For the QuantStudio6,
the protocol included the following: 95 °C for 20 s followed
by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s and annealing at
a temperature between 55 and 60 °C for 20 s. On both machines,
a melt curve was subsequently performed in all reactions to ensure
that a single amplicon was generated for each target gene. Cycles-to-threshold
(Ct) values were automatically obtained using the
ThermoFisher Scientific Cloud Software for qPCR file processing (https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/cloud.html). These values were subsequently exported to an Excel file and manually
processed to generate fold change expression values. The expression
of each gene of interest was normalized to the geometric mean54 of the expression of at least two housekeeping
genes (PPIA, RPL13A, and/or HPRT1), generating the ΔC(t) value, and expression of 2–ΔΔC(t) relative to the flat control
for each cell type, and N ≥ 3 experimental
replicates are reported. Statistical analysis information is listed
in the relevant section below. Custom primers were purchased from
Invitrogen and tested for specificity prior to use. Sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Extraction
of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting
Medium
from cells on nN or flat substrates was gently aspirated, and cells
were rinsed two times with ice cold PBS. Cell lysate from 8 chips
were extracted in 300 μL of cell lysate buffer (4 M urea, 150
mM NaCl, PhosSTOP (Roche), and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche)) by scraping on ice. Lysates were sonicated using
an immersion probe for 10 s pulse at 200 W. Insoluble protein was
removed by centrifuging at 15 000g for 10
min at 4 °C. Protein was quantified using Qubit protein assay
(Q33211, Thermo) and Qubit fluorometric quantification instrument
(Thermo). Protein samples were prepared with 4× sample buffer
containing β-mercaptoethanol in a ratio of 3:1 and heated at
80 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was conducted using
TGS running buffer (Bio-Rad) for 45 min at 100 V. Gel transfer was
conducted using Transblot-turbo (Biorad). Blots were probed with primary
mouse anti-human vinculin (Abcam ab18058, 1:1000) and secondary (Li-Cor
IR 680, 1:1000) antibodies in iBind fluorescent solution (SLF1019,
Thermo) using the respective iBind Flex western device. Blots were
analyzed for intensity of fluorescent band using a Li-Cor Odyssey
imaging system.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Cells
on nN or flat substrates
were fixed in 2.5% v/v glutaraldehyde solution (Sigma) for 1 h in
PBS at room temperature and then washed three times in PBS. PBS buffer
was substituted with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, USA), and cells were washed twice for 5 min. Cells were
postfixed in 1% v/v osmium tetroxide for 1 h in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate
buffer and subsequently washed with distilled water two times for
5 min. Samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol dilutions (20,
30, 50, 70, 80, 90% v/v ethanol in water), treated with 100% ethanol
four times for 5 min, after which they were treated with hexamethyldisilazane
for 5 min and air-dried. Samples were mounted and sputtered with 10
nm of chromium (Q150, Quorum) and imaged using Sigma300 (Zeiss) scanning
electron microscope with a working distance of 10 mm and an accelerating
voltage of 5 keV.

Quantifying Actin Stress Fibers
Actin stress fibers
were quantified from confocal images. To highlight stress fibers,
the actin channel was filtered by performing convolution with a 6
by 10 kernel with the central two columns containing a positive value
and outer four columns containing a negative value. Convolution was
performed with orientations of the kernel at 3° intervals between
0 and 180°, and the maximum value for each pixel over 60 orientations
was then selected. Other kernel shapes and orientation regimes were
tested; however, this choice emphasized stress fibers most effectively,
as judged by visual inspection (Figure S2).

Thresholding was then performed on these images, and the
subsequent binary mask appeared to match stress fibers well. Regions
below 100 pixels in size were removed as these were largely noise.

Quantifying Focal Adhesion Density
To determine the
focal adhesion density, the number of focal adhesion regions in the
image, divided by the image area covered by actin (determined by a
similar threshold operation to blurred actin image) was calculated.
Significance was determined by pairwise t test between
10 analyzed fields of view taken over two experimental repeats.

Quantitative Cell Morphology Analysis
Quantification
of cell and protrusions morphology was performed on tiled wide-field
microscopy images using the MATLAB image analysis toolbox. Background
correction was performed by negating the image with itself, following
very large Gaussian blur. Marker controlled watershed segmentation
was then performed on DAPI channel to identify nuclei. Nuclei touching
the border, or below a threshold intensity, were filtered. To identify
the cell cytoplasm, thresholding was performed on the actin channel
to identify the image region containing cells. Watershed on the actin
channel resulted in extensive mis-segmentation, thus utilizing nuclei
as markers, and the actin containing image region as the boundary,
marker-controlled watershed segmentation was performed on the YAP
channel. This resulted in effective detection of cell boundaries with
the substrate and with other cells. Cells with mean actin intensity
similar to background were filtered out, as were those touching the
border.

Feature Extraction
Features describing cell and protrusion
morphology were extracted from cell and nuclei segments. For intensity
and texture properties, the original images were used, without background
correction; however, images were log transformed, and subsequently
the 10th percentile intensity was deducted to align background intensity
to zero, thus reducing technical intensity variations between replicates.
Protrusion regions are defined by applying a large erosion and dilation
operation to the whole cell segment. This generated a highly rounded
core, region of cytoplasm not in this core are defined as protrusions.
A list of the features extracted for linear discriminant analysis
is given below.

Linear Discriminant Analysis
LDA between flat substrate
and nN was performed on cells pooled over 3 experimental repeats for
HUVEC and hMSC cells, with two technical repeats for two experiments,
and one technical replicate for one experiment. Each cell type was
analyzed independently, where cells were labeled as “Flat”
or “nN” and the features described above were extracted
for all cells. R2 values for HUVEC and
hMSC cells were 0.286 and 0.343, respectively; p <
0.001 in both cases. Also, LDA applied to data following random permutation
of class labels led to insignificant separation. These R2 values correspond to 75 and 78% correct substrate classification
of HUVEC and hMSC cells, respectively. The box plot in Figure 1 shows a random sample of 900
cells from each group. This analysis was conducted with the Scikit-Learn
module for Python.55

YAP Localization
Analysis
YAP intensities and localization
were calculated following cell and nuclei segmentation as described
above. Three features on YAP localization were recorded:Nuclear YAP intensity: taken as the
median of the nuclear
YAP intensities

Cytoplasmic YAP intensity:
the cytoplasmic segments
was eroded by a fixed width (10px), such that pixels bordering the
substrate and other cell were not included, subsequently the median
YAP intensity from this region was taken.

Log nuclear to cytoplasmic YAP ratio

YAP nuclear
to cytoplasmic localization changes both in wild-type
and following drug and DMSO treatment were recorded from a pooled
random sample of 180 cells taken over two experimental repeats, with
two technical repeats per experiment. Significance of differences
was calculated using a pair wise t test between single
cell populations.

Focal Adhesion Quantification
To
identify focal adhesions,
a similar approach to actin stress fiber identification was employed.
Confocal images of cells treated with CSK and then stained for vinculin
were used for image analysis. Vinculin channel images were filtered
by performing convolution with a 5 by 6 kernel with the central two
columns containing a positive value and outer two columns containing
a negative value. Convolution was performed with orientations of the
kernel at 10° intervals between 0 and 90°, the maximum value
for each pixel over the 9 orientations was then selected. Following
thresholding similar to actin bundle quantification (Figure S2), regions below 10 pixels in size were removed as
these were largely noise.

Again, to determine the focal adhesion
density, the number of focal adhesion regions in the image divided
by the image area covered by actin (determined by a similar threshold
operation) was calculated. Significance was determined by pairwise t test between 10 analyzed fields of view taken over two
experimental repeats.

Quantification of Lamin Signal
In Figure 4E–G, single
cells were
isolated from cropped confocal z-stack images for analysis using ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). A line
was drawn in the x–y plane
along a row of nN interacting with the nuclear envelope, and a reslice
image was created (reslice shown in Figure 4I). Reslice line width was 25 pixels for Figure 4F and 20 pixels for Figure 4G. From the reslice
images, one of two quantifications was performed. For data in Figure 4F, a line of 20 pixel
width was created in the reslice image and hand-drawn along the base
of the nuclear envelope and up the entire z-height of each individual
nN. Along this line, the signal for lamin A and lamin B channels were
recorded (test line). In another area of the nuclear envelope where
nN were not interacting (i.e., top nuclear envelope
or space between nN interfacing), an additional line of 20 pixel width
was drawn, and the lamin A and lamin B signal values over this line
were averaged as a normalization factor for that specific reslice
image (normalization line). Then, all values recorded from the test
line were normalized to the respective average calculated from the
normalization line, providing a fold change measurement for each lamin
channel within that particular reslice image.

To obtain the
data in Figure 4G,
reslice images were prepared in the same way, and two additional lines
were prepared for measurement of signal within the reslice image.
Two identical lines of 20 pixel width were drawn in the y-direction (that is, perpendicular to the nN height). One line was
placed in the middle of the nN z-height (middle line) and an identical
line was z-shifted to the top of the nN z-height (top line), and signals
for nN, lamin A, and lamin B channels were recorded. Similar to above,
a normalization line was also recorded from an area within the reslice
along a 20 pixel width line where nN were not interacting. The troughs
within the nN signal were detected from the inflection points around
local maxima of the nN signal from the middle line. Lamin A and/or
lamin B signals were then integrated from trough-to-trough distances
for the middle and top lines. This analysis was performed because
measurement of lamin A or B signal at specific points along the nN
width in the original reslice image did not reveal the accumulation
of the protein signal around the nN in the y-direction.
Integrated values were subsequently normalized to the respective average
values calculated from the normalization line, and the ratio of integrated
lamin A/B at the nN middle and top is reported. In Figure S11, the integrated values for lamin A or B at the
middle or top were normalized and reported.

Statistical Analysis
Statistics on biochemical data
were performed with GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA). When
comparing two groups, a Student’s unpaired t test was performed. When comparing more than two groups, a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by pairwise comparisons via Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. For the
comparison of lamin A/B ratios in Figure 4, a nonlinear exponential curve was fit to
the data set, and the best-fit values are reported. For image analysis,
MatLab (Mathworks, Cambridge, UK) was used to analyze data and prepare
charts.

For qPCR analysis, three to four experimental replicates
were performed, with at least two biological replicates within each
experiment. For each experimental replicate, the expression of the
gene of interest (GOI) was normalized to the geometric mean of at
least two housekeeping genes (HKGs) following previous methods,56 which generated the ΔCt value. For each cell type, the average was calculated for the normalized
GOI expression on flat samples, and expression of all groups was then
normalized to these values. This resulted in an expression value equal
to 1 for HUVEC or hMSC flat samples but carried a nonzero standard
deviation that reflected the intraexperimental heterogeneity of biological
replicates. In order to propagate this error, the relative standard
deviation (RSD) was calculated for all groups of interest, where  where N is the number of
experimental replicates (N = 3–4) and SD_expRep
represents the standard deviation of the normalized expression for
each group within each experimental replicate. This approach allowed
for the variability within each experiment to be propagated. Of note,
for lamin A and lamin B gene expression in Figure 4, the expression of all groups was normalized
to HUVEC flat so that cell type-specific differences in lamin signal
could be observed. For Figure S13A–D, ΔCt values for each GOI were compared as
a ratio and were not normalized to the expression of the flat control
cells (i.e., ANKRD1/LMNA describes
ΔCt_ANKRD1/ΔCt_LMNA).

For all box plots, the
25th and 75th quartiles are represented,
the line is the median, and the whiskers extend to the minimum and
maximum data points, unless the point is a statistical outlier (and
is therefore shown in red). For all experiments, p < 0.05 was considered significant.
