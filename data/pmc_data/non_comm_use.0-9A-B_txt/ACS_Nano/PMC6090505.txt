Nanoparticles
(NPs) are increasingly used in biomedical applications,
but the factors that influence their interactions with living cells
need to be elucidated. Here, we reveal the role of NP surface charge
in determining their neuronal interactions and electrical responses.
We discovered that negatively charged NPs administered at low concentration
(10 nM) interact with the neuronal membrane and at the synaptic cleft,
whereas positively and neutrally charged NPs never localize on neurons.
This effect is shape and material independent. The presence of negatively
charged NPs on neuronal cell membranes influences the excitability
of neurons by causing an increase in the amplitude and frequency of
spontaneous postsynaptic currents at the single cell level and an
increase of both the spiking activity and synchronous firing at neural
network level. The negatively charged NPs exclusively bind to excitable
neuronal cells, and never to nonexcitable glial cells. This specific
interaction was also confirmed by manipulating the electrophysiological
activity of neuronal cells. Indeed, the interaction of negatively
charged NPs with neurons is either promoted or hindered by pharmacological
suppression or enhancement of the neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin
or bicuculline, respectively. We further support our main experimental
conclusions by using numerical simulations. This study demonstrates
that negatively charged NPs modulate the excitability of neurons,
revealing the potential use of NPs for controlling neuron activity.

Inorganic
nanoparticles (NPs)
are original tools to treat brain diseases. Given their high surface
to volume ratio, NPs enable efficient loading of therapeutic molecules,
while their material-specific intrinsic properties offer alternative
therapeutic opportunities.1−3 For instance, for patients affected
by glioblastoma multiforme, cisplatin-tethered gold NPs act as drug
carriers and as radiosensitizers, emitting ionizing photoelectrons
and Auger electrons in radiotherapy.4 Similarly,
the heat generated by iron oxide NPs under an oscillating magnetic
field has been exploited (i) to perform hyperthermia treatment on
human glioblastoma,5 (ii) to temporally
damage the brain barrier thus facilitating NP crossing,6 and (iii) to promote NP uptake by opening heat-sensitive
ion channels.7,8 However, the use of NPs as drug
carriers or therapeutic materials requires a deeper understanding
of the principles governing their interaction and functional effects
in neuronal circuits. Given the increasing number of NPs available
and the increasing interest in studies pertaining to NP–cell
interactions,9−12 there has been a substantial effort to correlate the NP material
features (e.g., composition, size,
shape, coatings, etc.) to their neuronal toxicity
and activity.13−18 Since aberrant neuronal electrical activity is associated with most
neurological diseases19,20 and can be an early marker of
neurotoxicity,21 it is crucial to understand
how NPs can modulate brain electrical function.

Controlled NP-induced
bioelectric activity could be exploited to
design nanotools that can regulate the imbalanced excitation/inhibition
phenomena observed in many brain diseases. For instance, both single-22 and multiwall23 carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) boost electrical activity of neurons cultured on
CNT-coated substrates. Since functional changes were also observed
with “non-targeted” CNTs, the authors proposed that
the intrinsic electrical conductivity of CNTs might determine neuronal
electrophysiological effects. More recent studies performed with NPs
of various compositions appear to contradict the initial hypothesis
that only the electrical properties of the materials determine functional
effects on neuronal activity. For example, neurons cultured on multi-electrode
arrays (MEAs) exposed to carbon black (CB), hematite (Fe2O3), and titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs display
an acute, concentration-dependent alteration of spontaneous electrical
activity.15 An increased electrical excitability
also occurs in mouse hippocampal slices exposed to star-shaped Au
NPs,18 an observation confirmed at the
single neuron level by patch clamp recordings.24 Moreover, as shown in another study, quantum dots (QDs)
with a negative coating were preferentially internalized by neurons
with respect to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglia, suggesting
that the surface charge is critical for neuron-specific uptake.25 In this study, we have elucidated the mechanisms
through which NPs modulate bioelectric activity from single neuron
to neuronal networks.

We conducted our study on primary cultures
of neurons since this
experimental model facilitates access both to single-cell and large
neuronal networks,15,26,27 and it allows complementary measurements at the subcellular, cellular,
and network scale. We have tested the effects of NPs that differ in
shape (spherical and cylindrical), dimensions (inorganic core material
ranging from 5 to 75 nm), composition (cadmium- or iron-based), functionalization,
and charge. By combining confocal microscopy and transmission electronic
microscopy with single neuron and network-wide electrophysiology techniques
on primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, we found that soon after
administration of the NPs, the neuron–NP interactions are exclusively
determined by the surface charge of the NPs. We observed that negatively
charged particles were selectively localized on the neuronal membrane
and induced electrophysiological alterations at both single neuron
and network levels. Further, results obtained through the pharmacological
manipulation of the electrical neuronal activity suggest that the
neuron–NP interaction is mediated by neuronal activity.

Results
and Discussion
NP Interaction with Neurons Depends on NP
Surface Charge and
Is Shape-, Size-, and Material Independent
In a first series
of experiments, rod-shaped semiconductor NPs made of a core/shell
CdSe/CdS were added to the cell culture media of in vitro grown primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. These NPs, also known
as quantum rods (QRs), with different length and diameter sizes (see
Tables S1.1 and S1.2 and Figure S1.1 of the Supporting Information, SI) were initially chosen because of their bright
fluorescent signal, enabling a straightforward investigation of interactions
by confocal microscopy. The hydrophobic QRs, synthesized in nonpolar
solvent with organic ligands, were transferred in water using an established
amphiphilic polymer coating protocol; the binding of amino-modified
polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules provides increased stability to
these NPs in physiological media.28,29 In a typical
experiment, upon QR addition, neurons became fluorescent within 10
min (QRs at 1 nM, see Figure 1A and the time-lapse movie Movie M2.1). This suggests a fast localization of these NPs to the neuronal
cell membrane, through the somatic and the dendritic neuronal subregions.
A similar fluorescent signal was observed with different QR samples
of the same composition and of different longitudinal lengths or diameters
(see for instance Figure S2.1). However,
in some experiments, when testing QR batches with similar sizes and
surface coatings, QRs did not produce the same fluorescent signal
(Figure 1B). These
divergent results prompted us to carry out a systematic study on a
wide array of QRs samples, with the aim of disentangling their physicochemical
properties and their ability to interact with neurons.

Figure 1 The effect of NP surface
charge on the interaction with neurons:
Confocal microscope images (left panel; excitation wavelengths of
488, 560, and 647 nm) of primary hippocampal neural cells incubated
with 1 nM of negatively charged fluorescent QRs (sample no.7 in Table S1.2) after 10 min of incubation at RT.
Neurites and dendrites are covered by negatively charged QRs (A, green
signal). Yellow represents the combination of NPs (green signal) and
a neuronal marker (VGAT, red signal) and highlights the healthy condition
of the entire neural network and the colocalization between QRs and
synapses (MCC = 0.45 ± 0.06). (B) The same neuronal culture incubated
with QRs identical in shape and size (sample no. 9 in Table S1.2), but with a positive zeta potential;
note the absence of QR fluorescence. These results are independent
of QR size. Functionalization effect on the neuron–QRs interaction
(right panel; excitation wavelengths of 405 and 488 nm); the chemistry
used to tune NP surface charge was varied. In functionalization type
I (C), to the same polymer-coated (PC) QRs, amino-PEG derivatives
bearing carboxyl (COOH) or methoxy (OCH3) or amino (NH2) as the other ending moieties were bound to the QR surface.
In functionalization type II (D), to PC QRs, a fixed amount of amino-PEG-OCH3 (via EDC chemistry) was attached, and different
amounts of tertiary amine (N,N-dimethylethylenediamine)
were covalently linked to the polymer shell. Negatively charged QRs
always interacted with neurons independently of the functionalization
protocol (E and G, sample nos. 3 and 4, respectively, in Table S1.2), while positive QRs did not interact
(F and H, sample nos. 10 and 9, respectively, in Table S1.2). The blue signal in panels e–h indicates
the cell nuclear staining with DAPI. Scale bars: 100 μm.

We found that the NP surface charge,
which is measured as zeta
potential value, was crucial in determining their interaction with
neurons. QR samples with zeta potential more negative than −20
mV adhered on the neuronal membrane and gave rise to the fluorescent
signal, whereas QRs with a zeta potential value higher than −20
mV did not show this effect and resulted in no detectable neuronal
fluorescence signal. To confirm this dependency on zeta potential,
we designed an experiment that allowed tuning of the final zeta potential
(Figure 1C, functionalization
type I). An aliquot of the same pristine hydrophobic QRs was first
transferred in water by the polymer wrapping procedure and later,
the QR charge was tuned from positive to negative by attaching different
amino-PEG derivatives (amino-PEG-metoxy, amino-PEG-carboxyl, or diamino-PEG
molecules) to the polymer-coated QRs. Contrary to the negatively charged
QRs (−35 mV), which maintained their interaction with neurons,
neither the positively charged (zeta potential of +25 mV) nor the
neutral QRs interacted with neurons, as confirmed by confocal microscopy
(compare Figure 1E
and 1F). Almost neutral or slightly positive
QRs also failed to interact with neurons; QR fluorescence was either
visible on the substrate as
tiny aggregates or not detectable (Figure S2.2, even in absence of neurons, positive QDs interact with the substrate
resulting in tiny fluorescent spots; data not shown).

Interestingly,
while the charge was tuned by changing the type
of functionalization, we found that the final interaction of QRs with
neurons primarily depends on the QRs’ zeta potential. We used,
for instance, an alternative strategy to adjust the charge of the
QRs from −50 mV to +35 mV by fixing the amount of amino-PEG-OCH3 molecules and varying the amount of amino-alkyl-tertiary
amine molecules bound to the QRs (Figure 1D, functionalization type II). Even in this
case, the negative QRs still interacted with neurons, while the positively
charged QRs did not (compare Figure 1G,H).

In addition to rod-shaped NPs, we also
investigated spherical NPs
(QDs) of similar composition (CdSe/ZnS) and with similar fluorescent
properties to QRs, thus enabling confocal imaging. When comparing
the interaction with neurons of negative, neutral, and positive QDs,
the results are consistent with those obtained with QR (see Figure S2.3 and an example of a time-lapse recorded
with neutral QDs, Movie M2.2). This supports
the hypothesis that only negatively charged NPs interact with neurons,
independent of their size and shape. These findings are in agreement
with a previous study that reported the selective uptake of negatively
charged QDs in brain slices after an overnight incubation.30

To directly image the QRs on neurons at
higher magnification, we
performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission
(STEM). Negatively charged QRs localized close to the plasma membrane
of cell bodies (Figure 2A). They were also frequently located at synapses, inside the synaptic
clefts (Figure 2B,C),
and also along neurites (Figure S3.1A,B). In contrast, positive QRs were never found on neurites, neuronal
somata, or synapses (Figure S3.2A–C). Negative QRs were only occasionally observed in endocytic pits
or enclosed in endocytic vesicles in the cell cytoplasm (Figure 2A). In fact at a
short incubation time (10 min), endocytosis is not expected to yet
occur. EM tomography enabled us to reconstruct the 3D distribution
of QRs on neurons. QRs were mostly detected either contacting or in
the close vicinity of the neuronal membrane. EM tomography unambiguously
confirmed the presence of QRs at synapses, inside the synaptic cleft
(Figure 2C and Movie M3.1).

All of these experiments were performed with cadmium-based
NP material.
Therefore, we could not exclude that the material composition might
also affect the NP–neuron interaction. To eliminate this possibility
and demonstrate the same phenomenon with a second material, we tested
magnetic NPs made of iron oxide NPs, γ-Fe2O3, with either a spherical (12 nm in diameter) or rod (65 nm ×
6 nm) shape. Since the magnetic NPs do not fluoresce, the imaging
of NP interaction with neuronal cultures was performed exclusively
by TEM and STEM. Similar to the QRs, both spherical and rod-shaped
NPs with negative zeta potential interacted with neurons, independent
of their length and shape (Figures 2D,F and S3.1C,D). Electron
tomography further confirmed that negative Fe2O3 rods were randomly oriented on the neuron surface, lying parallel,
obliquely, or perpendicular with respect to the cell membrane (Figure 2D and Movie M3.2). They were arranged in a more parallel
fashion mainly in the synaptic cleft, likely due to steric hindrance
effects (Figures 2B,D
and S3.1C,D). Also in this case, positively
charged iron oxide NPs were never found on neurites or neuron cell
bodies (Figure S3.2D–F).

Interaction
of Negatively Charged NPs with Neurons Is Driven
by Neuronal Spiking Activity
Next, we studied the localization
of NPs in cultures expressing both neuronal and glial cell types,
the latter being nonexcitable cells that modulate neuronal activity.31 Ten minutes after the application of the negative
fluorescent QRs (L = 30 nm, d =
5 nm, Zp −25 mV), the fluorescence of negative QRs was selectively
detected on neuronal cells (Figure 3). This occurred even though the glial cells were closely
associated with neurons (identified in red by using glial fibrillary
acidic protein, GFAP).

Figure 3 Negative NPs interact exclusively with excitable neurons.
Neurons
labeled with NeuN (blue) and glial cells labeled with GFAP antibody
(red) were treated with 1 nM negatively charged QRs (green, −35
mV, sample no. 2 in Table S1.2). Note the
QRs attach exclusively to the membrane of neural cells. Scale bar:
50 μm; excitation wavelengths: 488, 560, and 647 nm.

An explanation for such selectivity of negative
NPs for neuronal
cell types could be related to the electrical activity of neuronal
cells, which might specifically attract NPs with a “charge-driven
effect”. To test this hypothesis, we pharmacologically manipulated
electrophysiological activity in neuronal networks, by increasing
or reducing spiking activity using Bicuculline (BICU) or Tetrodotoxin
(TTX), respectively, and characterized the NP–neural interaction
with confocal microscopy. These experiments confirmed that the level
of neuronal spiking activity modulates the attraction of negatively
charged QRs to the neural cell membranes (Figure S2.5). An increase in network activity with BICU resulted in
enhanced neuronal fluorescence, while suppression of the neuron network
activity by TTX impaired the association of negative QRs with neurons.
In contrast, positive QRs were never localized on neurons in the presence
of either BICU or TTX. Therefore, negative NPs interact with neuronal
membranes, and this interaction is mediated by neuronal spiking activity.

Negatively Charged NPs Affect Neuronal Bioelectric Activity
in Networks
We next investigated whether these NPs might
also interfere with electrical activity at the scale of single neurons
or neuronal networks. First, we characterized the effects of NPs on
network-wide electrical activity by exploiting high-density multi-electrode
arrays (HD-MEAs) and by computing mean activity parameters. These
devices (Figure 4A)
provide 4096 simultaneously extracellular recording electrodes (i.e., 42 μm pitch, array arranged
in a 64 × 64 layout) and allow computing with high statistical
significance mean activity parameters to characterize network activity.27 After culturing dissociated hippocampal cultures
on HD-MEA chips for 21 days in vitro (DIV), the typical
experimental protocol consisted of recording the spontaneous activity
for 10 min, followed by administration of 1 nM NPs, and then recording
the activity after treatment for additional 10 min. Representative
temporal traces of the detected spiking activity on single electrodes
as a function of time, before and after addition of NPs, are shown
in Figure 4B. Network
activity changed upon administration of negative NPs (Figure 4B), while there was no clear
variation for positive NPs. The effects on the network activity of
the different NPs were quantified by computing four mean activity
parameters: (i) the number of active channels (channels with >0.1
spike/s), (ii) the mean firing rate (MFR, the firing rate averaged
on all the active channels), (iii) the mean burst rate (MBR, the average
number of bursts per minute), and (iv) the interspike burst interval
(ISBI, the average firing rate of spikes during the burst events).
While the MBR and ISBI characterize the spiking synchronicity of the
network, the MFR and the number of active channels define the global
spiking activity of the network. Since in these measures, functional
effects were also exclusively dependent on the surface charge of the
NPs, the statistical analysis was performed by grouping all NPs belonging
to the same zeta potential (Zp, X-axis) interval
(i.e., Zp < −40 mV, −40
mV < Zp < −20 mV, −20 mV < Zp < 0 mV, Zp
> 0 mV) independent of their shape, material, or type of functionalization
(Figure 4c). Each data
point represents the normalized increase of the plotted parameters
after NP administration with respect to basal conditions averaged
from at least three independent measurements for each NP type. For
all the parameters, there is a significant increase with respect to
the basal network activity when Zp < −20 mV, thus demonstrating
a clear relationship between charge of the NPs and modulation of the
network activity. This indicates that negatively charged NPs not only
increase the global spiking activity of the network but also the spiking
synchronicity of the network, up to a plateau of about −20
mV. These effects disappear when Zp is close to 0 mV and when positive
NPs are administered.

0 mV, n = 25; one way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
post test; * p < 0.05; ** p <
0.01; *** p < 0.001).

Second, we investigated the effects of NPs on single-neuron
activity
with the patch clamp technique in the voltage clamp mode. In this
experimental configuration, it was possible to record postsynaptic
currents (i.e., electric signals
below the action potential threshold) from an individual neuron within
the neuronal network. This electrophysiological approach is complementary
to HD-MEA recordings and provides high-quality intracellular signals
from single neurons. Interestingly, these patch clamp experiments
revealed that negatively charged NPs induced a significant increase
in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents,
thus resulting in an enhanced charge transfer to the postsynaptic
element (Figure 4D–F).
In contrast, neutral or positive NPs did not significantly alter synaptic
parameters (Figure 4F). These results corroborate the HD-MEA data, indicating that negative
NPs are able to trigger an overall increase in neuronal and synaptic
activity.

Negatively Charged NPs Depolarize Neuronal Membrane: A Numerical
Simulation
In order to estimate the effect of negative NPs
on the membrane potential, numerical simulations were performed with
the finite element method (Comsol Multiphysics). Figure 5A,B shows the results for CdSe/CdS
QR and CdSe/ZnS QD, respectively. To build the model, zeta potential
and the hydrodynamic radius (RHy) of the
NPs were used as input parameters to determine the charge distribution
around each NP. Furthermore, the static permittivity for both CdSe/CdS
and for CdSe/ZnS was considered.32,33 We first considered
the simplest case of spherical QDs. Starting with the experimental
measurements of the zeta potential of −22 mV for the QD (−25
mV for QR) and knowing the hydrodynamic radius measured for QD samples
(23 nm), we assigned the same hydrodynamic radius (RHy of 23 nm) to the rod-shaped QR, which is less obvious
to extract from the DLS data. We assumed indeed that the polymer layer
(polymer coating + PEG molecules) occupies the same space around each
NP. For the QR, we considered a longitudinal arrangement of the rod
(with length of 30 nm and diameter of 6 nm) on the surface, since
from the TEM analysis, most of the rods were parallel to the membrane.
With these parameters and assuming a membrane resting potential of
−70 mV and a membrane thickness of 5 nm, we computed a depolarization
effect around 5 mV for both QDs and QRs when the NPs are in close
contact to the membrane. This simulation supports the depolarization
effect measured with MEA and patch clamp measurements.

Figure 5 Numerical finite element
method calculations resolving the effect
of a CdSe/ZnS QD (A) and CdSe/CdS QR (B) on the membrane potential.
For both types of particles, the hydrodynamic radius RHy is equal to 23 nm, as suggested by our experimental
estimation. For both the QD (A2, A3) and QR (B2, B3), two situations
are shown: zeta potential (Zp) equal to a negative or a neutral value
(0 V), respectively. In (A2), for QD with Zp = −22 mV, there
is a depolarization effect corresponding to ΔV = 65 mV. The
same result occurs in case (B2) for Qr with Zp = −25 mV. For
both structures (A3, B3), upon Zp = 0 V, there is no variation of
the membrane potential. The 2D electric potential distribution is
also shown for both structures. It is interesting to note that the
effect of the charges is noticeably stronger along the axis passing
through the center of QR/QD. Finally, the colored mapping images (under
A2, A3, B2, and B3) represent the charge distribution along the zeta
axis on the membrane once in contact with negatively charged QD or
QR.

Indeed, in the plots of Figure 5A (similarly for
B), three curves are shown: (i) the
blue curve associated with an isolated membrane with static resting
potential of −70 mV; (ii) a green curve describing the potential
along the axis of an isolated QR (or QD); and (iii) a red curve resulting
from the presence of a QR (or QD) on top of the cell membrane. For
all three cases, the electric potential is calculated along the Z-axis of the NPs, moving from the point of contact of the
NP at the membrane to Z positions that are further
from the membrane (corresponding to the white dotted lines in the
2D electric potential distributions below).

For both QR and
QD, we observed a clear shift of the membrane potential
from −70 mV to −65 mV. This suggests an increased neuronal
action potential firing once the membrane is in contact with negatively
charged NPs. Such a potential reduction is not uniform over the contact
area between the QR/QD and the membrane, as shown by the 2D distributions
of the electric potential. In particular, for the zeta potentials
of −22 mV (QD) and −25 mV (QR), the 2D plots describe
the depolarization effect with the brightest colors associated with
the strongest occurring depolarization. Conversely, when the zeta
potential is equal to zero, there is no reduction of the membrane
potential. Finally, the two images showing the charge distributions
around the membrane upon contact with negatively charged particles
explain why, experimentally, our negative QD and QR could easily adhere
to the cell membrane: A net attractive Coulomb interaction has pushed
the negative NPs to move toward the membrane. A positively charged
NP would not promote the attraction toward an outer positive membrane.

Discussion
The present study identifies the key determinants
of NP interactions
with neuronal functional activity at both synaptic and network levels.
The NP surface charge is crucial for the modulation of neuronal electrical
activity, while NP size, shape, and material play a negligible role
in the association and functional interaction with neurons. These
results are in agreement with the literature on single material studies.
For instance, similar NP–neuron interactions were observed
for negative carbon black, hematite iron oxide, titanium dioxide,15 and gold NPs.18,24 However, the
interactions in those studies, unlike those reported in this work,
were investigated over prolonged time exposure (from few hours to
days) and at different concentration ranges within them. In this work,
we have conducted a systematic study on different NP materials, of
different size, shape composition, and coating, and we have investigated
the immediate effects of NPs just after their administration, within
the first few minutes and at a rather low-concentration range. Our
experimental data demonstrate four main results: (i) only negative
NPs (zeta potential < −20 mV) adhere to neurons (bodies,
neurites and synaptic clefts); (ii) negative NPs selectively interact
with neuronal excitable membranes; (iii) negative NPs on neurons cause
a depolarization of neurons and measurable changes in neuron and neuronal
network electrical activity; (iv) the suppression of neuronal activity
by TTX hinders the interaction of negative NPs with neurons.

Our theoretical model explains how a Coulombic potential on the
outer neuron surface retains only negative NPs. Importantly, these
simulations predict membrane depolarization that supports the experimental
evidence of increased neuronal activity, as measured at the single
neuron and at the whole network levels. However, this simulation model
does not account for the selective interactions of NPs with neurons
and not with nonexcitable glial cells. Based on our data, three key
factors appear to determine the selective localization of negatively
charged NPs on neurons and the electrophysiological activity change.
First, neuronal spiking activity attracts NPs, as demonstrated by
experiments with TTX and by the lack of localization on glial cells.
Second, Coulombic attraction retains only negatively charged NPs at
the cell membrane, as observed in our simulations. Third, the presence
of negatively charged NPs on neurons induces a depolarization, as
measured in our electrophysiological experiments and also predicted
by our model, which in turn facilitates the crossing of the threshold
for firing an action potential.

To explain the attraction of
NPs, which appears to be induced by
neuronal spiking activity, we speculate that the strong depolarization
during the firing of an action potential (up to +40 mV) could transiently
remove the counterions surrounding the negatively charged NPs, thus
allowing a tight and stable electrostatic interaction between the
negatively charged NP surface and the positively charged outer side
of the neuronal membrane. This mechanism could explain the selective,
activity-dependent interaction of NPs with neurons, as we observed
with imaging, EM, and electrophysiology. Besides the Coulombic interactions
at the cellular membrane, the presence of NPs at the synaptic cleft
could also be due to the matching of NP size with the cleft space.
NPs at synapses are indeed expected to be strategically located to
operate a further “fine modulation” of neuronal excitability.

The selective NP–neuron interaction shown here paves the
way to innovative applications of NPs in neuroscience. The key role
of NP surface charge for neuronal interactions is a fundamental finding
for the future design of NPs for neuron targeting. The specific interaction
with neurons, but not with glial cells, could represent an excellent
opportunity to discriminate between these two cell types for selective
drug delivery. In addition, the higher sensitivity to neuronal activity
suggests that negatively charged NPs could be used as markers of active
neurons for long-term imaging, easily measured by NP fluorescence.
This approach could be exploited, for instance, to visualize aberrant
increased neuronal activity in neurological disorders. In the same
conceptual framework, negatively charged NPs could also reveal alterations
of excitability in different subregions of individual neurons (e.g., soma vs distal dendrites),
an important factor for the emergence of specific brain states, including
network oscillations and selection of cell assemblies.34 Along the same lines, the increased neuronal
activity could be exploited to increase the activity of inhibitory
neurons with reduced excitability that are responsible, for example,
for severe forms of epilepsy.35 More generally,
given an efficient neuronal subtype-specific targeting, in principle,
NPs could be exploited to finely modulate the balance between excitation
and inhibition in the brain, a major determinant for most neurological
diseases.

HD-MEA experiments have revealed that the increase
in the overall
spiking activity by NPs is accompanied by a change in the network
synchronicity. This could be induced by the uniform increase of the
neurons’ activity, reaching a high level of network stability.
Alternatively, NPs could differentially affect neurons in the network
by, for example, preferentially activating neurons with high connectivity
(hub neurons) that may be more likely to interact with NPs due to
longer dendritic/axonal length and more complex arborization. Such
activity-dependent behavior of negative NPs might allow the design
of nanomedicine tools for the control of neuronal activity or for
the selective delivery of drugs to firing neurons.

Conclusions
NPs with negatively charged surfaces rapidly localize on neuronal
membranes and induce electrophysiological alterations. In contrast,
the same type of NPs with positive or neutral zeta-potential shows
no or low nonspecific interaction with the cellular membrane and no
effects on bioelectric activity. These effects are material independent
because similar results occurred with magnetic NPs as well as Cd-based
semiconductors. Importantly, the interaction of negative NPs is not
only selective for excitable neuronal cells but also dependent on
neuronal activity. These observations suggest that electric activity
most likely plays a role in the specificity of the NP–neuron
interaction. Finally, numerical simulation supports the proposed mechanism
for the selectivity of negative NPs and the modulation of neural electric
activity.

NP Synthesis
All
QDs, QRs, and magnetic NPs used were
prepared by the seeded growth approach as already reported.36−39 The surfactant-coated colloidal NPs were transferred from organic
solvent into water by implementing a previously developed polymer-coating
procedure.29,40 To tune the surface charge of
the NPs, further surface coating with amino derivate PEG molecules
(henceforward referred as functionalization type I) was achieved by
means of EDC cross-linking chemistry.28,41 Three different
PEG molecules derivates were used: monoamino PEG, diamino PEG, and
bifunctional carboxy-amino PEG. As alternative functionalization,
the tertiary amine N,N-dimethylethylenediamine
was covalently attached to the polymer shell (hence referred as functionalization
type II). In both types of functionalization, proper variation of
the molar ratios of PEG/EDC or N,N-dimethylethylenediamine/EDC, respectively, allowed to adjust the
average surface charge of the NPs from negative to positive values
(see Table S1.1 for functionalization conditions
chosen). In all cases, the surface charge of the NPs was varied in
the range from −50 mV to +35 mV as measured after the functionalization
in aqueous media. In Table S1.2, a summary
of the type of functionalizatrion, zeta potential (Zp), NP size parameters
(length (L), rod diameter (d), dot
radius (R), and emission wavelength for fluorescent
NPs are reported. Table S1.2 shows also
which NPs were employed for confocal microscopy, TEM, and electrophysiological
investigations. In Figure S1.1, a collection
of TEM images of NPs used in this study is shown Figure S1.1.

Neuronal Cultures
Culturing media
and additional compounds
were acquired from Gibco-Invitrogen. Primary hippocampal neurons were
prepared from E18 rat as previously described.42 Briefly, hippocampi were manually isolated in Hanks’
balanced salt solutions (HBSS) and incubated for 15 min with 0.125%
trypsin at 37 °C. After trypsinization, tissues were mechanically
dissociated through a fire-polished Pasteur pipet.

The cells
were then plated onto coverslips (diameters of 18 and 25 mm) previously
coated with 0.1 mg/mL PDL to promote cell adhesion and sterilized
by UV light exposure for 30 min at a density of 120 and 160 cells/mm2 in 12 and 6 multiwell plates (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA).

Neurons were let to adhere 2 h in an incubator, and then 2 mL of
NB complete medium were added in each well and incubated at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. The culture medium was replaced every 7 days.
Neurons were cultured until 29 DIV.

NP–Neuron Interactions
Most of the experiments
were performed at 24−25 DIV, unless differently specified.
NPs were administered in the NB complete medium to reach a final concentration
of 1 nM and let to incubate for 10 min. For TEM experiment, a higher
NPs concentration (10 nM) was used.

NPs interaction with neural networks: Confocal Microscopy Characterization
Immunofluorescence
and Confocal Microscopy
Cells were
washed once in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, fixed
with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature (RT) for
30 min and washed three times in 1× PBS. Fixed samples were permeabilized
with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 15 min. Blocking solution
(PBS 1×, 1% BSA, 5% FBS) was added for 45 min at RT to block
nonspecific reactions. The following primary antibodies diluted in
blocking solution were used: mouse anti-VGAT (Synaptic System, Goettingen,
Germany, cat. no. 13101) or mouse anti-PSD95 Thermo Fisher Scientific,
mouse monoclonal MA1–045) for synapsis labeling, rabbit anti-GFAP
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) as glial cell marker, and mouse anti-NeuN
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for neuron nuclei. After incubation
for 3 h at RT, samples were washed and incubated with secondary Alexa647-labeled
goat antimouse or antirabbit (Invitrogen) for 45 min at RT. In the
case of nuclei staining, secondary Alexa488 goat antimouse (Invitrogen)
was used. Samples were mounted using DAKO antifade reagent, in some
cases containing DAPI (Invitrogen), and stored at 4 °C. Samples
were imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. Imaging was performed
using 405 nm excitation wavelength and emission bandpass filter 458/10
nm for DAPI; 488 nm excitation wavelength for cell autofluorescence,
with emission bandpass filter 525/40 nm; 488 nm wavelength to excite
NPs, with emission bandpass filter 595/50 nm; 638 nm wavelength to
excite Alexa-647-labeled VGAT and PSD95, with emission bandpass filter
700/40 nm. Manders’ correlation coefficient (MCC) was used
to quantify merging of two fluorescence channels. Quantification of
NP adsorption was computed as the mean pixel intensity of NP fluorescence
normalized over the number of cells detected in each image (to take
into account the variability of cell density).

The acquisition
of the videos was performed in liquid, by injecting NPs at a final
concentration 1 nM directly in the well containing the coverslips
in PBS buffer and imaging at an acquisition rate of 1 frame every
30 s.

Confocal Imaging of Neural Networks Activity Alteration
Neural network activity was chemically altered by using TTX and BICU.
Neurons at 21 DIV were incubated for 15 min with TTX and BICU dissolved
in NB serum complete solution at concentration 1 μM and 30 μM
respectively. After incubation time, the solution was removed and
replaced with NPs dispersed at 1 nM concentration in NB serum complete
solution containing either 1 μM TTX or 30 μM BICU at concentration.
Cells were then washed in PBS, fixed in PFA, mounted in coverslip
using Prolong Antifade reagent containing DAPI, and analyzed by confocal
microscopy as described in paragraph Immunofluorescence
and Confocal microscopy.

Electron Microscopy (EM)
Analysis
EM Methods
TEM and high-angular annular dark-field
(HAADF) STEM were performed on mouse primary hippocampal neurons doped
for 10 min with Fe2O3 nanorods and dots differing
exclusively in their overall surface charge in a range from −40
mV to +25 mV). Similar experiments have been conducted on a plethora
of nanorods differing in composition, overall surface charge and dimensions
(see Tables S1.1 and S1.2). The neurons
were plated on glass coverslips and fixed with 0.66 M cacodylate-buffered
1.25% glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive
rinsing in the same buffer, the samples were postfixed in a solution
of 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide and 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate
buffer, stained overnight in the dark in a 0.5% aqueous solution of
uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded
in EPON resin. Sections of 70 nm were cut with a diamond knife (Diatome)
on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome and stained with lead citrate and
uranyl acetate. EM tomography was performed in bright-field TEM and
HAADF STEM on thick sections (ranging in thickness from 100 to 250
nm). Computation weighted back-projection (WBP) of tomograms was done
with the IMOD software package.43,44 Segmentation and three-dimensional
visualization were performed using the Amira software package (FEI
Visualization Science Group, Bordeaux, France). EM projection images
and HAADF STEM tilted series were collected using a FEI Tecnai G2
F20 equipped with a Schottky field-emission gun and recorded with
a 2k × 2k Gatan BM UltraScan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.

Electrophysiological and Neural Network Activity Recording
Electrophysiological
Recordings
Inhibitory spontaneous
postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded in the whole-cell configuration
of the patch-clamp technique. External recording solution contained
(in mM): 145 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2,
10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes, pulled from borosilicate
glass capillaries (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany), had a 4–5
MΩ resistance when filled with intracellular recording solution
containig (in mM): 150 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 2 Na2ATP (300 mOsm and pH 7.2 with KOH).
Currents were acquired using Clampex 10.0 software (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). sIPSCs were recorded at room temperature from a holding
potential of −60 mV in the presence of CNQX (10 mM) to isolate
GABAergic events. Currents were sampled at 20 kHz and digitally filtered
at 3 kHz using the 700B Axopatch amplifier (Molecular Devices). sIPSCs
were detected by using the “scaled sliding template”
detection algorithm implemented in pClamp10, first described by Clements
and Bekkers45 and by setting the “detection
criterion value” to 5. QRs and QDs were bath applied in the
recording chamber following the recording of a baseline trace of at
least 5 min. The effects of QRs and QDs were examined 10 min after
application. The stability of the patch was checked by repetitively
monitoring the input and series resistance during the experiments.
Cells exhibiting 10–15% changes in the duration of the whole
experiment were excluded from the analysis.

Neural Network
Activity Recording with High-Density Multi-Electrode
Array (HD-MEA)
Extracellular electrophysiological in vitro experiments were carried out by means of a recently
developed HD-MEA. These devices, thoroughly reviewed in ref (46), provide a matrix of 4096
electrodes (sensing area 21 × 21 μm2, pitch
42 × 42 μm2) arranged in a 64 × 64 layout
and covering an area of 2.7 by 2.7 mm2. After seeding and
growing dissociated neuronal cultures on top of the active area, extracellular
recordings of the spontaneous network activity were performed simultaneously
from all the 4096 electrodes at 7 kHz sampling rate.

Before
seeding, HD-MEA chips were sterilized 20 min in 70% ethanol, rinsed
abundantly in double deionized sterile water (DDW), filled with neurobasal
complete medium (NB complete medium) and kept overnight in incubator
to increase hydrophilicity. Then the active area of the devices were
coated with promoting adhesion factors as poly-d-lysine (PDL)
0.1 mg/mL or Polyethylenimine (PEI) 1:500 for at least 12 h. Successively
a drop of 20–30 μL containing dissociated hippocampal
neurons (see Neuronal Cultures) at a nominal
concentration of 1000 cell/μL was seeded on the recording area
of the chips, and after 2 h about 1.6 mL of NB complete medium was
added to fill the reservoir. Chips were maintained in an incubator
at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and about 50% of the volume of the
culture medium was replaced every 7 days.

Experiments were performed
after 21 DIV once cultures already provide
strong spontaneous activity expressing both spikes as well as network
bursts (i.e., synchronous tonic
spiking events spreading on all the network). The experimental protocol
consisted of 10 min recording of the basal activity at room temperature
20 min after removing the chip from the incubator. Then NPs were administered
to the NB complete medium to a final concentration of 1 nM (i.e., 5 μL in a total volume of 0.5
mL). A few seconds after administration, the activity of the neural
network was recorded for 10–15 min. Control experiments administering
to the neural networks using the same volume of PBS buffer, without
NPs, were also carried out.

Four main parameters were analyzed
to evaluate the effect of NPs
on network activity: (i) the number of active channels (>0.1 spike/sec),
(ii) the MFR, the firing rate averaged on all the active channels,
(iii) the MBR, the average number of burst per minute, and (iv) the
ISBI, the average firing rate of spikes during the burst events. To
obtain them, spike events were detected by using the precise time
spike detection algorithm already presented in ref (47), while the identification
of the network bursts was performed following the algorithm described
in ref (48).

Numerical
Calculations
The FEM model was setup by using
COMSOL Multiphysics v5.2. The simulation included two electrostatic
calculations. The first calculation served as reference and solved
the Poisson equation by fixing a 0 V potential on the external surface
of the membrane and −70 mV on the internal one. No charge was
placed in the QD/QR shell at this stage. The second calculation solved
the Poisson equation by placing a charge density (in order to provide
a surface potential matching the measured zeta potential) within the
QD/QR shell. No membrane potential was set at this stage. The total
potential was then plot by adding potential values from the two calculations
at each point of the domain.

For both electrostatic calculations,
the designed elements were surrounded by a 200 nm × 200 nm ×
200 nm box terminated with 10 nm of infinite elements layer to truncate
the calculation and to mimic an effectively more extended simulation
domain. The outer surfaces of the box were set as ground for both
calculations.
