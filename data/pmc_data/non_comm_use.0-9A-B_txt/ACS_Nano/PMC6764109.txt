We
describe the triggered assembly of a bioinspired DNA origami
meshwork on a lipid membrane. DNA triskelia, three-armed DNA origami
nanostructures inspired by the membrane-modifying protein clathrin,
are bound to lipid mono- and bilayers using cholesterol anchors. Polymerization
of triskelia, triggered by the addition of DNA staples, links triskelion
arms to form a mesh. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observe
nanoscale local deformation of a lipid monolayer induced by triskelion
polymerization that is reminiscent of the formation of clathrin-coated
pits. We also show that the polymerization of triskelia bound to lipid
bilayers modifies interactions between them, inhibiting the formation
of a synapse between giant unilamellar vesicles and a supported lipid
bilayer.

==== Body
Much of our
understanding of
membrane biology arises from direct observation of active cellular
membrane processes, including the dynamic modulation of the size,
shape, and properties of the membrane by the action of membrane-associated
proteins.1 Proteins such as annexins and s-layer proteins assemble into dense networks to impart
structural rigidity and protection from the environment.2,3 Peripheral membrane proteins such as clathrin, dynamin, SNARE proteins,
and BAR-domain proteins are associated with site-specific membrane
curvature.4−6 Clathrin, which has a characteristic triskelion shape,
is a well-studied example.4 During endocytosis,
clathrin self-assembles to form a polyhedral lattice that gradually
coats the membrane. Upon polymerization of the protein, the lipid
bilayer invaginates and eventually detaches from the cell membrane
(assisted by the action of dynamin)6 to
diffuse into the cytoplasm.

DNA nanotechnology provides the
opportunity to construct simplified
biomimetic models for the study of biological systems.7−13 DNA can bind to a lipid membrane electrostatically and through hydrophobic
interactions of unpaired bases.14,15 Conjugation with lipophilic
moieties such as cholesterol improves the ability of DNA origami nanostructures
to associate with, and diffuse on, lipid bilayers,7,8,14,16−19 allowing the assembly of ordered arrays.7,8,11,14,20 Recently, Xu etal. demonstrated DNA structures used as a support for the organization
of SNARE proteins leading to membrane fusion.12 DNA origamis can also be designed to mimic the shapes and functions
of membrane-modifying proteins: Franquelim etal. demonstrated an origami structure for membrane binding
and sculpting,11 and Grome etal. explored a spiral DNA origami, inspired by
dynamin, that can polymerize to induce membrane tubulation.13

In this paper, we study the properties
and interactions of a DNA
origami triskelion, which models the structural properties of clathrin
and can be programmed to polymerize into flexible, extended, membrane-bound
assemblies. We observe nanoscale membrane deformations, which resemble
the effects of clathrin assembly, when DNA origami triskelia are polymerized
on a lipid monolayer coating an EM grid. We also show that polymerization
of the origami triskelia affects the interactions between lipid bilayers.

Results
and Discussion
We designed a three-arm DNA origami nanostructure
whose shape resembles
that of the clathrin triskelion (Figure 1, Supporting Figure S1).21 The DNA origami is approximately
20 times more massive than its natural counterpart.22 Each triskelion arm consists of 28 parallel DNA helices
organized on a honeycomb lattice to create a 13 nm diameter bundle
that is 30 nm long. The angles between the arms of the DNA triskelion
are constrained by rigid three-helix bundles that form bridges connecting
the midpoints of each arm (Figure 1A, Supporting Figure S1).
We sought to control the shape of the triskelia by using bridges of
different lengths: the flat triskelion has arms of 92 base pairs (bp)
(angle between arms approximately 120°, Figure 1A,B), and the curved triskelion has arms
of 84 bp (forming a triangular pyramid with a height of approximately
18 nm, Figure 1C,D).
Arms are linked to each other, where they meet near the center of
the structure by single-stranded DNA links, formed by routing the
scaffold strand between arms, and by the bridges between arms (through
which the scaffold also runs). Triskelia can be programmed to assemble
into extended arrays on addition of staples that link arms end-to-end.
An edge in this network is approximately 60 nm long, twice the dimension
of the natural clathrin lattice.23

structure is visible, covered by a partially ordered triskelion array
with hexagonal and pentagonal cells. (F) as in E but using curved
triskelion dimers. Magnified images in the right-hand panels of E
and F are of structures similar to those shown on the left. We attribute
the formation of discrete, triskelion-coated membrane structures (E
and F) to local deformation (budding) of the membrane induced by the
nanostructure.

We functionalized the triskelion
with three cholesterol groups
on the broader “bottom” surface of each arm to enable
direct attachment to lipid membranes. Six Alexa647 fluorophores are
attached to the narrower upper layers of DNA helices (Supporting Figure S1) for visualization by fluorescence microscopy.
In the right-hand electron micrograph in Figure 1C the honeycomb cross-section of the bundles
of helices in the origami arms is clearly resolved: the “top”
of each arm, a layer of four DNA helices, is at the center of the
3-fold structure, indicating that the triskelion has been forced into
a conformation in which the cholesterol anchors lie on the convex
side of the distorted structure, as shown in the diagram (Supporting Figure S2). Other images indicate that
triskelia also fold with the cholesterols on the inner side (Supporting Figure S3).

Clathrin self-assembles
into arrays as a result of weak attractive
interactions distributed along its arms.22,24 For design purposes it was easier to localize the linking sites
of our artificial triskelion at the extremities of its arms, doubling
the distance between two attached origami centers compared to that
of clathrin. Individual DNA triskelia can be linked through the addition
of DNA staples that bind to the origami scaffold at the ends of the
arms. Most of the experiments described used preformed triskelion
dimers, which we found to give better-formed arrays when bound to
a membrane and polymerized. Dimers are formed during origami assembly
using six dimerization staples, each of which binds to scaffold domains
at the ends of both of the arms 1 of the two component triskelia,
forming six parallel connections between them (Figure 1B,D and Supporting Figures
S4 and S5). Dimers can be linked into arrays by adding two
sets of six DNA polymerization staples (12 strands in total), each
of which hybridizes to the scaffold at the ends of one of the free
arms (arms 2 and 3), creating 10 overhanging 6-nucleotide “sticky
ends” at the end of each arm (Supporting
Figures S4 and S6). These sticky ends are designed such that
hybridization of the sticky ends displayed on arm 2 of one dimer to
those on arm 3 of another links the two arms together: this connectivity
is consistent both with a hexagonal array and with the formation of
pentagonal cells (Supporting Figure S4D),
allowing curvature. The pattern of connections between pairs of arms
is such that the two origamis are aligned with the membrane-binding
faces orientated in the same direction.

Triskelion networks
were observed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Networks formed by polymerization in solution, in the absence
of lipids, are generally extended and poorly ordered; occasional polygons
are observed (Supporting Figure S7). Triskelia
inserted into the membranes of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) formed
dense coatings around the vesicles (Supporting
Figure S8). However, distortion of the vesicles by the relatively
harsh staining and drying protocol required for TEM (Materials and Methods) precluded clear identification of the
effect of the DNA origami on membrane shape.7

Polymerization of triskelion dimers on supported lipid monolayers
was imaged by TEM using an apparatus adapted from that developed in
the group of McMahon (Supporting Figures S9, S10 and Materials and Methods).25,26 Addition of a small excess of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC, 10–20% more than monolayer coverage) to a pool of buffer
in a Teflon well leads to the formation of a lipid monolayer, which
can be transferred to a gold TEM grid, stained with uranyl acetate,
and observed by TEM (Supporting Figure S11). Flat triskelion dimers injected into the well attach readily to
the lipid surface that covers the grid and polymerize into an extended
network reminiscent of clathrin assembly (Figure 1E). Curved triskelia form denser, less regular,
networks (Figure 1F).
In both cases distinct, isolated, clusters, approximately circular
in projection, are observed after, but not before, triskelion polymerization
(Figure 1E and F, Supporting Figures S11–S13). These structures
are consistent with local deformation (budding) of the monolayers
induced by the formation of triskelion arrays and are similar to TEM
images of clathrin-coated pits on lipid monolayers.25−27 In the case
of flat triskelia, the circular clusters are frequently partly circumscribed
by high-contrast crescent-shaped regions, characteristic of the projection
image of a partially collapsed bleb.28 This
is particularly clear in Supporting Figure S11E, in which two such structures are superimposed. In the case of curved
triskelia, the clusters are more densely stained with little evidence
of collapse. Observation of on-edge triskelia at the edges of the
circular structures supports our interpretation that the membrane
is deformed (Supporting Figure S13).

The membrane blebs induced by the two triskelion variants are qualitatively
similar, despite that fact that one triskelion is designed without
intrinsic curvature and the surface of the other is much more curved
than the blebs themselves. In neither case can our triskelia be forcing
the membrane to conform to an intrinsic array curvature. This is consistent
with the observation that the clathrin protein can form planar as
well as curved arrays, yet clathrin alone (if bound to the membrane)
is sufficient to induce the formation of spherical buds.29 It has been suggested that natural membrane
bending, including the formation of clathrin-coated pits, is not directly
dependent on the details of protein structure but is driven by crowding
of membrane-anchored proteins:30 protein
crowding alone is even sufficient to drive membrane fission.31 We suggest that a similar mechanism drives the
membrane deformation that we observe: triskelion polymerization induces
locally dense membrane coverage and (in contrast to better-ordered
and more rigidly connected arrays of membrane-bound DNA nanostructures)8 the disordered triskelion lattice provides an
entropic drive for the membrane to curve away to relieve crowding.

The induction of membrane curvature through polymerization of DNA
triskelia is qualitatively different from the effects of membrane-bound
DNA nanostructures reported previously. Most published studies of
DNA nanostructure arrays on membranes are of planar arrays on planar
membranes. Indeed, tightly packed and well-ordered DNA arrays have
been shown to induce planar deformations of naturally curved GUV membranes.8 Where increases in membrane curvature have been
achieved by membrane-bound DNA nanostructures, it has been through
strong interactions that force the membrane to conform to the intrinsic
curvature of the nanostructure.9−11,13 It has been suggested that the natural role of the similarly shaped
proteins that inspired these nanostructures is to sense, rather than
to induce, membrane deformation.32−34

In order to study
of the dynamics of triskelion–membrane
interactions, we used fluorescence microscopy to observe triskelion
assembly on lipid bilayers, using both giant unilamellar vesicles
(GUVs) and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). These experiments do not
resolve the sub-micrometer membrane deformations described above but
do enable investigation of the effects of triskelia on membrane interactions.
The two triskelion types (flat and curved) behaved similarly in these
experiments.

GUVs, comprising DOPC with 0.1 mol % fluorescently
labeled 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(Atto488-DOPE), were prepared
by electroformation in 52 mM sucrose.16,17 Triskelion
dimers with Alexa647 labels (Supporting Figure
S1) were assembled in equiosmolar TE-MgCl2 buffer,
incubated for at least 10 min with the GUV suspension diluted 20-fold
in the same TE-MgCl2 buffer (Supporting
Figure S14), and observed using confocal microscopy. Dimers
were observed to bind to membranes homogeneously and diffuse freely
(Figure 2A,B and Supporting Movie M1). When polymerization of the
dimers was triggered by addition of polymerization staples, DNA triskelia
assembled into dense networks on the GUVs (Figure 2C,D, Supporting Movies
M1–M4), observable as discrete, diffusing aggregates.
We do not see evidence of planar deformations similar to those induced
by the densely packed nanostructure arrays reported by Czogalla etal.8 Membrane-bound
DNA triskelion dimers, before and after polymerization, are enriched
at GUV–GUV interfaces (Figure 3).

the addition of polymerization staples. Scale bar: 20 μm. (B)
Intensity profiles along the lines indicated in A show the accumulation
of both unpolymerized and polymerized triskelia at GUV–GUV
interfaces.

We performed similar experiments
to examine the assembly of fluorescently
labeled triskelia on SLBs using epifluorescence and total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In contrast to their behavior
on GUVs, dimer diffusion and triskelion polymerization on the SLB
were inhibited: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
confirmed the presence of mobile lipids but immobile triskelion dimers
(Figure 4A). GUV–SLB
interfaces were formed by sedimentation of sucrose-containing GUVs
on an SLB washed in less-dense TE-MgCl2 buffer. Triskelia
diffusing freely on the GUV were excluded from this interface and
accumulated at its edge (Figure 4B i; see also Supporting Figure
S15 i). Triskelion dimers added after GUV–SLB interface
formation also accumulated at the junction between the two bilayers
(Figure 4B iv and Supporting Figure S15 iv). In each of these experiments,
the initial contact between a GUV and an SLB expands to form a planar,
circular, interface within seconds. However, when the triskelia bound
to GUVs are polymerized by addition of polymerization staples before
the two bilayers were brought into contact, formation of the contact
interface is inhibited for at least several minutes (Figure 4B ii, Supporting
Figures S15 ii and S16), When triskelion dimers are initially
bound to the SLB rather than to the GUV, triskelia are partially excluded
from the interface (Figure 4B iii and Supporting Figure S15 iii). The difference in behavior between triskelia initially bound to
the GUV (unpolymerized triskelia escape the interface) and to the
SLB (slowly diffusing triskelia remain at the interface) confirms
that the interactions between triskelia and the lipid bilayers are
directional, consistent with stable insertion of cholesterol into
the first membrane encountered.

and at GUV–SLB
interfaces. (A) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
analysis of fluorescently labeled curved DNA triskelia (Alexa647,

mobile, whereas the DNA triskelia are immobile. (B) TIRF micrographs
of fluorescently labeled triskelia at GUV–SLB interfaces: (i)
triskelia added to GUV before synapse formation are excluded from
the interface; (ii) triskelia added to GUV and polymerized before

to SLB before synapse formation remain at the interface; (iv) triskelia
added after synapse formation are excluded from the interface. Triskelia
used (see Supporting Figure S15 for the
other type): curved (i, iii); flat (ii, (iv). Scale bars: 10 μm.

Accumulation of triskelia at the interfaces between
GUVs is consistent
with passive diffusion-mediated trapping. It implies that triskelia
mediate an attractive interaction between the membranes by binding
to both, an important mechanism in cell adhesion;35,36 it is consistent with the observation that DNA origamis can bind
to lipid membranes even in the absence of cholesterol anchors.37 In contrast, the exclusion of triskelia from
an SLB–GUV interface (where GUV-bound triskelia are able to
diffuse away from the interface) and the inhibition of interface formation
by polymerized triskelia (whose escape is hindered) suggest that there
is a repulsive interaction between GUV and SLB mediated
by triskelia. The marked asymmetry between triskelion-mediated GUV–GUV
and GUV–SLB interactions is intriguing. All membranes have
the same lipid composition: the most obvious difference between them
is that the SLB is planar and closely bound to a glass surface, whereas
the GUV bilayer is constrained only by its natural elasticity and
any residual difference in osmotic pressure across it. We hypothesize
that the stable incorporation of a triskelion array at a GUV–GUV
interface requires significant distortion of the membranes to conform
to the far-from-planar triskelia: the SLB is incapable of this distortion.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated the controlled formation of extended DNA origami
triskelion arrays on lipid bilayers by electron and optical microscopy.
We have observed that polymerized networks of triskelia can induce
sub-micrometer deformation of a lipid monolayer, which is reminiscent
of the formation of clathrin-coated pits. Triskelia also modulate
lipid interfaces: they mediate an attractive interaction between free
bilayers but can inhibit the formation of an interface when one bilayer
is bound to a rigid substrate. These results help demonstrate the
potential of biomimetic membrane-associated nanostructures as tools
to control the dynamic behavior of lipid membranes and their shapes
and interactions. We anticipate that the exploration of the design
of membrane-modifying nanostructures will lead both to a greater understanding
of natural processes and to biomimetic systems for signaling, synthesis,
and reproduction based on membrane-bound compartments.

Materials and Methods
1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine labeled with Atto488 (Atto488-DOPE)
was purchased from AttoTec (Germany). All chemicals and solvents were
of analytical grade, purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific or Sigma-Aldrich,
and used without further purification. All DNA strands, including
Alexa647- and CholTEC- conjugates, were provided by Integrated DNA
Technologies and used as received. Single-stranded DNA scaffold M13mp18
(p7249) was supplied by VWR International Ltd. (1 μg/μL,
in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA) and used as received.

Triskelion
Synthesis and Purification
The triskelia
and triskelion dimers were folded in TE-MgCl2 buffer by
thermal annealing ramp on a programmable, temperature-controlled Peltier
heat block (Eppendorf Mastercycler thermal cycler) with the following
schedule: 65 °C for 15 min; decrease to 58 °C at −1
°C every 5 min; decrease to 40 °C at −1 °C every
60 min; decrease to 20 °C at −1 °C every 5 min.

After a solution of the DNA scaffold and staples was annealed to
yield the desired origami, the sample was purified with a hand-packed
size-exclusion column. This type of size-exclusion method foregoes
centrifugation and relies on gravity to elute the buffer through the
resin. The resin used was Sephacryl S-300 (GE Healthcare Life Science)
resuspended in folding buffer (1× TE + 14 mM MgCl2). A bed volume of 8 mL is needed to separate the origami from excess
staples. Disposable columns (GE Healthcare Life Science, PD-10) were
hand-packed with a bottom frit circle followed by the resin stock
in appropriate buffer (typically 1× TE + 14 mM MgCl2). The column was rinsed with buffer of twice the bed volume to sediment
and equilibrate the column before placing an upper frit circle that
protects the resin from drying out. A sample from 50 to 800 μL
was then applied to the top of the frit. To reduce dilution, it is
important to wait until the sample has been totally absorbed in the
resin, and the first fraction was collected before adding more buffer
to the reservoir. Typically, 19 fractions of approximately 250 μL
are collected per sample and analyzed by AGE (see protocol below).
A typical 50 μL sample of 20 nM triskelia usually yields one
250 μL fraction clear of staples at a concentration of 2–3
nM. This method works for triskelion monomer and dimers, as their
migration in the resin is similar.

After collection of the fractions
from the size-exclusion column,
10 μL of each fraction was loaded with loading buffer (0.25%
w/v bromophenol blue (Sigma-Aldrich), 30% w/v glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich)
in a well of a 1.5% agarose gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mM Tris
base, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) plus 14 mM MgCl2. A
potential of 50–60 V was applied along the length of the gel.
For long electrophoresis runs, the buffer was replaced halfway in
order to maintain a current of approximately 12 mA. The agarose gels
were stained with SYBR gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for analysis
by fluorescence. Fractions found to contain triskelia (typically fractions
10 and 11) were combined and used for confocal experiments. For quality
control, the bands of interest localized in the gel were cut out with
a scalpel, finely chopped, and pressed between two Parafilm-protected
microscope slides to extract the solution. The recovered volume was
imaged by TEM.

When triskelia were prepared for experiments
that did not require
confocal imaging, the triskelia were purified by AGE, stained with
SYBR gold, and extracted by cutting the bands out of the gel as described
above.

Insertion of Triskelia into Lipid Layers and Polymerization
Unless otherwise stated, polymerization of triskelion dimers and
monomers was performed as follows.

Triskelia without Lipid
Purified triskelia (50–100
μL, 0.5–3 nM) in 0.5× TBE buffer plus 14 mM MgCl2 were mixed with 10 equiv of polymerization staples (initial
concentration of added solution 2500 nM in 1× TE plus 14 mM MgCl2) and left at room temperature overnight. The sample was then
stained with UAc for TEM imaging as described below.

Cholesterol-Bearing
Triskelia and SUVs
Purified cholesterol-bearing
triskelia (75 μL, 3 nM) in 0.5× TBE buffer plus 14 mM MgCl2 were mixed with 15 μL of extruded SUVs (ca. 0.8 mg mL–1) in 1× TE buffer plus 14 mM
MgCl2 and left at room temperature for a minimum of 10
min to allow the cholesterol to insert into the bilayers. Polymerization
staples (10× equivalent, 2500 nM initial concentration in 1×
TE plus 14 mM MgCl2) were then added, and the sample was
left to polymerize at room temperature overnight before TEM imaging.

Cholesterol-Bearing Triskelia and GUVs
Purified cholesterol-bearing
triskelia dimers in 1× TE buffer plus 14 mM MgCl2 (20
μL, 1.3 nM) were added to 5 μL of GUV suspension diluted
20-fold in the same TE-MgCl2 buffer (final lipid concentration
∼0.001 mg mL–1) in 52 mM sucrose and left
for a minimum of 10 min to allow the cholesterol to insert into the
bilayers. For polymerization experiments, polymerization staples (10×
equivalent, 2500 nM initial concentration in 1× TE plus 14 mM
MgCl2) were added and left to polymerize at room temperature
for a minimum of 20 min before imaging.

The protocol for insertion
and polymerization of the triskelia for the monolayer assay is described
below (see monolayer assay).

TEM Imaging
TEM
micrographs were acquired using a FEI
Tecnai 12 with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV (Dunn School of Pathology,
University of Oxford, UK). The procedure used for grid preparation
(Formvar film and carbon coating of copper and gold grids) is described
elsewhere.38 A general protocol for sample
preparation for imaging is as follows. A 5–10 μL droplet
of DNA sample (1–50 nM) was placed on a glow-discharged grid
for 3 min with the grid held in a pair of reverse-action tweezers.
Excess liquid was removed by carefully dabbing the edge of the grid
with a piece of filter paper. The sample was then quickly washed with
7 μL of stain solution (1–2% UAc) and then blotted once
more with filter paper. A second droplet of stain was then applied
to the adsorbed sample and left on the grid for 10 s before being
blotted away.

Lipid Monolayer Assay
A custom-made
Teflon block (see Supporting Figures S9 and S10) was placed in a
humid chamber (a small sealed box containing a water-soaked tissue
on which the Teflon block is placed), and the wells were filled with
40–50 μL of TE-MgCl2 buffer. To form the lipid
layer, 1 μL of lipid mixture (DOPC dissolved in hexane 0.025
mg/mL) was carefully placed on top of the buffer in a well. As a negative
control, we used 1 μL of pure hexane without lipid (see Supporting Figure S11 A). The block was incubated
in the humid chamber for 30 min to allow the hexane to evaporate,
leaving a monolayer of lipid on the surface of the buffer. A carbon-coated
gold EM grid was placed, carbon side down, onto the top of each buffer
droplet. Grids were not glow discharged before use, as a hydrophobic
carbon film is required to adhere to the hydrophobic lipid tails of
the monolayer. Cholesterol-bearing triskelia were injected into the
well through a side channel, under the EM grid (final concentration
of 0.1–5 nM), and left for 30 min. The wells were then washed
with fresh buffer to remove noninserted triskelia from the bulk solution.
If the triskelia were to be polymerized, we then injected the polymerization
staples and left the sample between 6 and 12 h in the humid chamber
before removing the grid. The grid was removed by injecting approximately
20 μL of buffer into the side injection port to raise the grid
up above the surface of the Teflon block. The grid was removed with
forceps and lifted vertically off the droplet. The gold grid was stained
as described above without delay to prevent uncontrolled drying of
the surface.

Fluorescence Microscopy
GUVs and
SLBs were imaged using
a combination of confocal, epi-fluorescence, and TIRF microscopies.
Epi-fluorescence and TIRF microscopy were performed with a 60×
TIRF oil-immersion objective on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse
Ti-E). Continuous-wave laser illumination at 474 nm (∼50 μW)
and 644 nm (∼120 μW) (Vortran Laser Technology Inc.,
CA, USA) was used to excite fluorescence for both TIRF and epi-fluorescence
modes. The resultant fluorescent signals were transmitted through
a ZT488/640rpc dichroic (Chroma Technology Corp) before being separated
by an Optosplit II module (Cairn Research) with an FF660-DiO2 dichroic
and band-pass filters (Semrock) (680/42 and LP-664 on the red channel
and 550/88 on the blue channel). Samples were imaged on an electron-multiplying
CCD camera (Andor iXon+ 860) at 50 Hz. For FRAP experiments 0.5 mol
% Atto488-DOPE was added to DOPC prior to SUV generation and SLB formation.

Confocal microscopy was carried out in the Nikon Imaging Centre,
King’s College London. Imaging was performed with 20×
and 40× objectives, and 488 and 642 nm diode lasers were used
to illuminate the samples (50 μW).

SUV Formation
SUVs (liposomes) were formed by rehydrating
a lipid film. A DOPC lipid stock solution (100 μL, 10 mg/mL
in chloroform) was added to a glass vial and dried under vacuum overnight
(or for a minimum of 2 h) to remove traces of solvent. The dried lipid
film was then rehydrated in 1 mL of buffer and left at room temperature
for 1 h without stirring. This facilitates the detachment of the film
from the bottom of the vial and forms a suspension of polydisperse
multilamellar vesicles. The glass vial was then vortexed to produce
a homogeneous turbid solution. The turbid lipid solution was either
sonicated with a diving tip or subjected to cycles of freeze–thaw
to break the large multilamellar vesicles into smaller liposomes.
If sonicated, the glass vial was placed in a beaker of cold water
and sonicated (0.5 s every second for 5 × 60 s, 80% power, probe
tip sonicator (Vibra Cell, 3 mm titanium probe). The sonication tip
was then washed by starting a 1 min cycle of sonication in a mixture
of 1:1 EtOH–isopropanol followed by a 1 min cycle in water.
If the vial was subjected to freeze–thaw cycles, the vial was
first frozen by plunging it into liquid nitrogen, followed by a hot
water bath (approximately 40 °C). The freeze–thaw cycle
was repeated five times or until the turbidity of the solution was
reduced. Lipid aggregates and larger vesicles were removed by extrusion
through a 0.2 μm polycarbonate membrane (Whatman) held within
a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) 21 times. Liposomes were stored
at 4 °C under an argon atmosphere and used within 1 week. When
mixed with triskelia and imaged by TEM, the SUV solution was diluted
10-fold. Electron micrographs were considered only if the large majority
of the grid had homogeneous staining and coverage, so that the images
taken are representative of the entire grid.

Lipid Bilayer Formation
SLBs were prepared on glass
coverslips by vesicle fusion.39 Lipid mixtures
in chloroform (40 μL of 25 mg mL–1 DOPC) were
dried under nitrogen and placed under vacuum overnight. The dried
lipids were hydrated in 2 mL of water and vortexed before tip sonication
(15 min). The resulting clear suspension of SUVs was centrifuged (3
min; 14000g) before the supernatant was separated
and retained.

Glass coverslips (VWR, Menzel Gläser #1)
were cleaned by sequential sonication in detergent (Decon-90) solution,
water, and then propan-2-ol before being stored in water until use.
Immediately before use, the coverslip was dried under nitrogen and
cleaned with oxygen plasma (Diener Electronic, Femto) for 3 min. A
well was created on each coverslip using vacuum grease (Dow Corning
high-vacuum grease). A 50 μL amount of SUV stock was diluted
1:1 in buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4) and added to
the chamber immediately. The vesicles were incubated for 60 min before
the membranes were washed with degassed Milli-Q, followed by PBS buffer
and finally replaced with 1× TE + 14 mM MgCl2 buffer.

GUV Formation
GUVs were prepared by electroformation.39,40 A 100 μL amount of lipid in chloroform (0.786 mg mL–1 DOPC and 0.1 mol % Atto488-DOPE) was applied to the conducting surfaces
of two clean ITO-coated slides (Delta Technologies, Loveland, CO,
and Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and dried under vacuum for >30
min.
The two slides were assembled as a capacitor, with a PDMS spacer of
1 mM thickness used to create a chamber of 1 mL volume between them.
This chamber was filled with ∼52 mM sucrose solution (equiosmolar
with 1× TE, 14 mM MgCl2 buffer), and the chamber (PDMS)
was fastened with binder clips. Electrodes were attached to the ITO
slides via adhesive copper tape, and an alternating
square wave potential of 1.4 V rms amplitude and 10 Hz frequency was
applied for 90 min. The resultant GUVs were transferred using a syringe
with large-bore, 21-gauge needle to avoid shearing.
