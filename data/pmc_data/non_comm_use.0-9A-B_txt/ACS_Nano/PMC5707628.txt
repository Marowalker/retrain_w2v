The observation of
micrometer size spin relaxation makes graphene
a promising material for applications in spintronics requiring long-distance
spin communication. However, spin dependent scatterings at the contact/graphene
interfaces affect the spin injection efficiencies and hence prevent
the material from achieving its full potential. While this major issue
could be eliminated by nondestructive direct optical spin injection
schemes, graphene’s intrinsically low spin–orbit coupling
strength and optical absorption place an obstacle in their realization.
We overcome this challenge by creating sharp artificial interfaces
between graphene and WSe2 monolayers. Application of circularly
polarized light activates the spin-polarized charge carriers in the
WSe2 layer due to its spin-coupled valley-selective absorption.
These carriers diffuse into the superjacent graphene layer, transport
over a 3.5 μm distance, and are finally detected electrically
using Co/h-BN contacts in a nonlocal geometry. Polarization-dependent
measurements confirm the spin origin of the nonlocal signal. We also
demonstrate that such signal is absent if graphene is contacted to
bilayer WSe2 where the inversion symmetry is restored.

Spintronics
has been proposed
for applications in logic devices as a complement or even an alternative
to devices based on the charge degree of freedom.1,2 Searching
for the ideal material that can transport spin-dependent currents
beyond micrometer size distances (e.g., spin interconnects) has been
one of the main focuses of spintronics research.2,3 In
this respect, graphene is promising due to its low spin–orbit
coupling,4 negligible hyperfine interaction,5 large Fermi velocity,6 and very high electronic mobility.7 Indeed,
it exhibits the longest spin relaxation length at room temperature
probed by magnetoresistance electrical measurements using ferromagnetic
electrodes.8,9 However, even these record values are still
orders of magnitude smaller than its intrinsic limit.6 The origin of this striking difference between theoretically
predicted and experimentally observed spin relaxation lengths could
still be spin-dependent scatterings at the graphene–ferromagnetic
electrode interfaces despite the recent advances in creating high
quality tunnel barriers.10−13 Nondestructive optical spin injection schemes could
be an appealing alternative. However, the absence of sufficient spin–orbit
coupling and weak optical absorption of graphene poses challenges
for their implementation.14 The absence
of optospintronics functionality in graphene is also a serious limitation
for the prospect of potential graphene spintronics applications.

In contrast, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit strong
light absorption even in their monolayers.15,16 Monolayer TMDCs also have spin-valley physics, which has captured
the interest of the solid state physics community.17−19 Due to the
broken spin degeneracy and the time-reversal symmetry, the spin and
valley degrees of freedom are coupled in such a way that excitation
by opposite handedness leads to preferential population of the K or
K′ valley with a defined spin orientation. Among TMDCs, tungsten
diselenide (WSe2) gets special attention due to the achievement
of valley polarization value close to unity and large external quantum
efficiency.20,21 More importantly, we choose WSe2 because it has the strongest spin–orbit induced splitting
among TMDCs (∼450 meV22) and its
use is expected to result in a more efficient spin injection than
in the case of MoS2.23 As proposed
by Gmitra and Fabian,14 the generation
of spin polarized charge carriers by using its spin coupled valley
selective absorption property24 could allow
inducing spin dependent currents in the superjacent graphene layer
through a tunneling process, without the need for a ferromagnetic
spin injector.

Toward this, we fabricated heterostructure devices
consisting of
monolayer WSe2, monolayer graphene, and h-BN on a conventional
SiO2 (∼270 nm)/Si wafer (Figure 1a). In order to ensure clean interfaces in
h-BN/WSe2/graphene heterostructure, we utilize the dry
transfer method described in ref (6) and anneal samples under high vacuum conditions.
Device fabrication is completed by forming the Ti/Co (10nm/35nm) electrodes. Figure 1b shows the optical
images for one of our typical heterostructure devices at different
fabrication steps. The final structure has an additional Co/h-BN/graphene
region, which is crucial for the electrical detection of the generated
spin signal. We note that such a stack could also host tunable magnetic
proximity effects and hence allow the possibility of additional control
of spin transport by gating.25 In order
to detect the nonlocal voltage signal, the lock-in technique is combined
with a photoelastic modulator (PEM), acting as a time-dependent variable
waveplate. The linear polarizer in front of PEM is used to control
the angle between incident light polarization and the optical axis
of the modulator (See Methods and Supporting Information). In this study, we characterized
five different devices. Here, we represent results obtained in two
different optospintronic devices, labeled as device A and device B.
Unless otherwise stated, the results shown are from device A. In order
to achieve the highest signal-to-noise ratio for a clearer signal,
we performed measurements at 4 K.

evaporation of the ferromagnetic Co electrodes.

Results and Discussion
Prior to any optical measurements,
we first characterized a graphene-based
spin valve device with trilayer h-BN used as a tunnel barrier. Figure 2a shows the device
conductivity as a function of back-gate voltage (VBG). Our device characteristically shows the typical ambipolar
field effect behavior. The charge neutrality point is observed at
negative VBG values, which indicates the
weak n-doped nature of graphene. Such doping is common for spin valve
devices.12 From the four-terminal measurement
configuration, we extract an electron mobility of ∼5500 cm2/(V·s) at ∼1 × 1012 cm–2 carrier concentration. At low bias range, we observe a nearly linear I–V relation (Figure 2b, inset). As the next step, we perform all-electrical
spin injection, transport, and detection measurement in a nonlocal
geometry (Figure 2a,
inset).26 For this, we apply a fixed current
of 5 μA between electrodes 1 and 2 and record the nonlocal voltage
between electrodes 3 and 4 while sweeping the in-plane magnetic field B∥. This changes the relative polarization
orientations of the injector (2) and detector (3) electrodes and induces
a nonlocal spin signal of ∼0.2 Ω (Figure 2b). In order to determine the spin polarization
(P) of electrodes (Co/3 layers of h-BN), which will
be later employed for detecting the optically generated spin signal,
we perform conventional Hanle precession measurements.26,27 Here, the nonlocal signal is recorded while the out-of-plane magnetic
field B⊥ is swept in the range of ±150
mT (Figure 2c). Since
the spin-dependent current precesses along the field, the signal decreases
(increases) for the parallel (antiparallel) configuration as the strength
of B⊥ is increased. The resulting signal
can be fitted with the solution of the Bloch equation,11  where L ≈ 4 μm
is the center-to-center separation between the injector and detector
electrodes and ΩL is the Larmor frequency. This gives
a spin relaxation time of τS ≈ 131 ±
1 ps, a spin diffusion constant of DS ≈
0.123 m2/s, and hence, a spin relaxation length of λS ≈ 4 μm at VBG =
0 V. These spin transport properties are comparable to those of typical
graphene spin valves11−13 but lower than for state-of-the-art graphene spin
valves.9 In our device structure, the h-BN
layer also acts as an encapsulation layer. This excludes polymer residues
as the source of spin scattering in our devices.28 The limiting factor could be the contact-induced spin scattering.
We believe that spin transport parameters in our device architecture
could be enhanced by carefully engineering the number of h-BN layers
to completely suppress the conductivity mismatch issue.10

(c) Hanle precession of the nonlocal signal as a function of the perpendicularly

Spin polarization value can be
calculated from29  where w and σ are the
width and conductivity of graphene, respectively. By inserting the
λS extracted from spin precession measurements, we
calculate P to be ∼0.6%. Next, we repeat spin
Hanle precession measurements as a function of VBG. The spin parameters extracted above strongly depend on
the VBG: both λS and
τS values are observed to be highest near the Dirac
point (Figure 2d).
The extracted P values have opposite VBG dependence: P value is smallest near
the Dirac point and enhances up to 2.85% at high VBG values. We consistently observe a very similar response
at all measured junctions within this device, which indicates the
large size uniformity of three-layer thick h-BN. Note that these spin
polarization values are an order of magnitude smaller than for the
best tunnel barriers ever created for graphene.30 However, they are comparable to the values obtained using
oxide based tunnel barriers28 and reliable
enough for detecting the optically injected spin currents.

Next,
we characterize our WSe2-graphene-h-BN heterostructure
device. Figure 3a shows
the VBG dependence of graphene conductivity
for device A which is similarly measured by using trilayer Co/h-BN
electrodes. We observe ambipolar characteristic with a weak n-type
doping. The corresponding I–V characteristic is also linear at low bias range. These results are
consistent with the device performance shown in Figure 2a. This suggests that our electrode could
serve as a spin detector. In order to determine how monolayer WSe2 affects electrical transport of the graphene channel when
the former is transferred on top of the latter, we have fabricated
another device, shown in Figure 3b inset. The design of this device allows us to perform
four-terminal measurements independently on the pristine graphene
as well as on the same graphene flake with monolayer WSe2 on top. Sheet resistance shown in Figure 3b reveals similar behavior of both regions
in a reasonable proximity to the Dirac point. We extract an electron
mobility of ∼5200 cm2/(V·s) and ∼5800
cm2/(V·s) at ∼1 × 1012 cm–2 carrier concentration for pristine graphene and WSe2/graphene heterostructure, respectively. This result indicates
the absence of any obvious effect of large band gap material WSe2 on graphene transport properties while the Fermi level is
kept in the band gap of the former material. Prior to optical spin
injection, we also optically characterize the WSe2 flake
in our device. In addition to the flake optical contrast, we confirm
the monolayer nature of WSe2 by photoluminescence measurements
using a 488 nm blue laser diode with low incident power of 40 μW.
As shown in Figure 3c, we observe a strong peak X0 near 1.66 eV corresponding
to the excitonic resonance in a monolayer flake. We can also distinguish
the lower energy X′ peak that could be associated with the
trion, localized exciton emission31 or
shortwave plasmons (See Supporting Information).32

measurements of monolayer WSe2.

Now we turn our attention to the optical spin injection aspect
of our study. The schematic of the device setup is shown in Figure 4a. We polarize the initially unpolarized light beam using
a linear polarizer oriented 45° to the optical axis of the photoelastic
modulator (PEM). This orientation of the incident light provides the
highest degree of modulated light circularity. PEM acts as a variable
birefringent plate providing time-dependent retardation along one
of the axes at a frequency of 50 kHz (1f). In the case of λ/4
modulation, applied retardation has maximal (minimal) value of λ/4
(−λ/4) with the PEM acting as a quarter wave plate at
these moments, thus generating the right (left) circularly polarized
light. Lock-in amplification of the nonlocal signal with the PEM (1f)
fundamental frequency (50 kHz, gray dashed line) results in a signal
that corresponds to the variation of the nonlocal signal caused by
the right- and left-handed light. Therefore, the resulting light modulation
is right-to-left (left-to-right) in the case of 45° (−45°)
incidence angle. This measurement configuration minimizes background-related
artificial signals. In order to ensure the full out-of-plane direction
magnetization of Co electrodes, we first apply B⊥ = 2 T33 and then set the
field to B = 0. By keeping B = 0 T, we exclude
any contribution from the valley-Zeeman effect.34 We note that the remaining out-of-plane magnetization of
Co is sufficient for contacts to be used as spin signal detectors.
Next, we focus the laser beam under quarter-wave modulation on the
device and detect the generated nonlocal signal electrically in a
nonlocal geometry. As shown in Figure 4b, we do not observe any significant nonlocal signal
while the light spot is parked on graphene. In contrast, once the
spot is placed on the WSe2/graphene heterostructure, we
observe a sudden increase in the nonlocal voltage reaching 1 μV,
even though the laser beam is much further away from the detector
electrodes compared to the initial case with the laser spot on graphene.
The signal returns back to its initial value of ∼0.1 μV
when the spot is placed back on top of the graphene region. This measurement
suggests that the measured signal is not due to spurious effects,
such as laser heating. The nonlocal origin of the signal is confirmed
by the length-dependent measurement. As shown in Figure 4c, the magnitude of the signal
decreases ∼25% from the initial value if the electrode 2 is
utilized as the detector, which is ∼3.7 μm far away from
the graphene/WSe2 interface. This is expected within the
spin transport theory as the spin dephases more while it travels a
longer distance and therefore the measured signal amplitude decreases.1 It is also worth mentioning that the measured
signal has a weak dependence on the location of the laser spot (See Supporting Information). This could be related
to the local interface homogeneity.

Nonlocal signal measured at junction 1 and 2. Junction 1(2) refers
to the nonlocal voltage measured between electrodes 1 (2) and 3. Inset
shows the optical image of the device. Scale bar is 3 μm.

In order to confirm that the origin
of the signal is the spin-coupled,
valley-selective absorption, we compare the nonlocal signals generated
at the monolayer WSe2/graphene and bilayer WSe2/graphene interfaces. Note that optical spin injection is not expected
in the latter interface case as the inversion symmetry is restored
in bilayer devices.18Figure 5a shows the spatial map of
the nonlocal voltage signal measured in device B at VBG = 0 V. For direct comparison, the optical image of
the device is shown in Figure 5a, inset. Similar to device A (Figure 4b), we detect the nonlocal voltage if only
the laser spot is parked on the monolayer WSe2. As we move
the spot on the bilayer WSe2 region, we observe a sudden
suppression of the nonlocal voltage. This unequivocally proves the
valley-selective origin of the signal.

WSe2 regions, respectively. The color scale bar is ∼1.2

(c) Laser power dependence of nonlocal signal generated under quarter
wave modulation. Inset: The dependence of nonlocal signal on the power
of incident light. (d) Modulation of spin signal as a function of
incident light polarization.

We also measure the nonlocal signal under quarter-wave (λ/4)
and half-wave (λ/2) modulations of incident light so as to demonstrate
the spin origin of this signal. Only the former modulation should
result in the spin-dependent signal as the activation of a specific
valley is only possible with the circularly polarized light, while
the half-wave modulation does not meet this requirement (See Supporting Information). If the origin of the
signal were not spin dependent, we would observe the same response
under both modulations. Figure 5b shows the time dependence of the nonlocal voltage measured
under λ/4, followed by λ/2 modulation. We observe a nonlocal
signal of ∼0.62 μV for the case of λ/4 modulation
and the signal drops significantly for the λ/2 modulation case.
Unlike in the λ/4 modulation case, the signal is nearly independent
of the incident laser power for the λ/2 modulation case as shown
in Figure 5c, inset.
We believe that this constant signal constitutes the background-related
portion of our nonlocal signal. Its origin could be the finite resistance
of graphene rather than any laser heating-related artifacts, as the
signal does not change with increasing laser power. Importantly, the
nonlocal signal under λ/4 modulation changes linearly with the
laser power (Figure 5c). We measure ∼9.5 μV nonlocal signal under 6.2 mW
laser power with slope close to ∼1.5 mV/W.

Importantly,
we further prove the spin-valley coupling origin of
the nonlocal signal by measuring its dependence on the ellipticity
of the modulated light by modifying the incident angle (θ) (Figure 5d). A value of θ
= +(−)45° indicates the modulation of polarization from
right to left, R-L (left to right, L-R). As shown in Figure 5d, the nonlocal signal shows
very strong dependence on θ, in a good agreement with the observation
in Figure 5b. We observe
a maximum signal of 0.6 μV under R-L modulation. The signal
decreases and changes its sign as θ is changed. We observe a
minimum signal of approximately −0.2 μV under L-R modulation.
The signal for the linear/linear case is ∼0.3 μV and
matches the value obtained for the λ/2 case, which was attributed
to the background signal. As shown in Figure 5d, such incident angle dependence is completely
absent for λ/2 modulation, which proves the optovalleytronic
origin of the spin injection process.

Finally, we compare the VBG dependence
of the nonlocal signal generated by electrical and optical injection
techniques. Figure 6a shows the VBG dependence of both charge
resistance and the amplitude of the nonlocal resistance obtained by
all-electrical measurements. We observe an inverse relation between
the local resistance and the nonlocal resistance. The nonlocal signal
is ∼0.12 Ω near the Dirac point, and as the VBG increases, the nonlocal signal increases 2-fold. Based
on 1D diffusion spin transport theory,29 such inverse scaling indicates that our contacts are not tunneling,
in a good agreement with the observation of linear I–V as shown in Figure 2a, inset. For the optical spin injection
case, the scaling between device resistance and the nonlocal signal
is completely different. The electrostatic doping decreases both the
channel resistance and the nonlocal signal. We observe the maximum
nonlocal signal at VBG = −20 V
that matches the Dirac point of graphene (Figure 6b). Such direct scaling has previously been
observed in graphene30 and black phosphorus35 spin valve devices and discussed to be the direct
signature of tunneling spin injection.29 Here, note that the nonlocal signal at the hole conduction region
decreases slightly faster than the electron conduction region, which
could be due to enhanced barrier height between graphene and TMDC
layers at lower VBG values.36−38

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated optical spin
injection into
graphene by benefiting from the spin-valley properties of monolayer
WSe2. We activate the spin polarized charge carriers in
the WSe2 layer by illuminating the crystal with circularly
polarized light. The generated spin current diffuses into the graphene
layer and transports over a distance of 3.5 μm before its electrical
detection through a three layer thick h-BN tunnel barrier. A recent
optical experiment in a graphene/TMDC based heterostructure suggests
that induced charge carriers are electrons.39 We exclude any spurious effects by prudently studying the separation,
power intensity and incident light polarization dependences on nonlocal
signal. We also compare the nonlocal signals generated at the monolayer
WSe2/graphene and bilayer WSe2/graphene interfaces
in order to prove its spin-coupled, valley-selective absorption origin.
Considering also the very recent Hanle precession measurements in
similar structures,23 these results form
the foundation of this emerging subfield of 2D heterostructures, which
will be the key for the optospintronics functionality in graphene
spintronics applications.

Methods
Device Fabrication
Our fabrication process starts with
the mechanical exfoliation of monolayer graphene on a conventional
SiO2 (∼270 nm)/Si wafer. Next, graphene is partially
covered with monolayer WSe2 by utilizing the dry transfer
method. Finally, a three-layer h-BN crystal is similarly transferred
by targeting the uncovered region of graphene. Optical images for
a heterostructure device at different fabrication steps are shown
in Figure 1b. Before
the metallization process, the heterostructure is annealed at 250
°C under high vacuum conditions (∼5 × 10–7 Torr) for 6 h. This process results in a cleaner interface between
two-dimensional (2D) materials by removing the transfer-related residues.
Electrode masks are prepared by utilizing a standard electron beam
lithography technique. Device fabrication is finalized by forming
the Co/Ti (35 nm/10 nm) electrodes. Deposition rate for both materials
is ∼0.5 Å/s, and the Ti layer serves as a capping layer
to prevent the oxidation of ferromagnetic Co electrodes.

Device Characterization
Techniques
All-electrical spin
transport measurements are performed with a standard AC lock-in technique
at low frequencies and at fixed current bias in the four-terminal
nonlocal spin valve geometry as a function of in-plane and out of
plane magnetic field (B∥ and B⊥). For optoelectrical measurements, the
monolayer WSe2 flake is resonantly excited at 720 nm (1.72
eV, black arrow in Figure 3b) using a supercontinuum laser with a maximal incident light
intensity of 190 μW at 4 K. In order to detect the nonlocal
voltage signal, the lock-in technique is combined with a photoelastic
modulator (PEM), acting as a variable waveplate. The linear polarizer
in front of PEM is used to control the angle between incident light
polarization and the optical axis of the modulator. This way, in the
case of quarter-wave modulation while using the fundamental frequency
of PEM as the lock-in reference signal (50 kHz), the maximal amplitude
of the signal should match the angle θ of +(−)45°,
which corresponds to the right-to-left (RL) (left-to-right (LR)) modulation.
During polarization dependent measurements, the ellipticity of the
light is modified by changing the polarization angle θ. This
decreases the signal amplitude, reaching the lock-in noise floor when
incident light polarization is parallel to the PEM optical axis. For
the experiment with linear light modulation, half-wave configuration
of PEM was used with double frequency (100 kHz) as a reference signal.
