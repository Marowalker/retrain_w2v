The intrinsic properties
of nanomaterials offer promise for technological
revolutions in many fields, including transportation, soft robotics,
and energy. Unfortunately, the exploitation of such properties in
polymer nanocomposites is extremely challenging due to the lack of
viable dispersion routes when the filler content is high. We usually
face a dichotomy between the degree of nanofiller loading and the
degree of dispersion (and, thus, performance) because dispersion quality
decreases with loading. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable
pressing-and-folding method (P & F), inspired by the art of croissant-making,
to efficiently disperse ultrahigh loadings of nanofillers in polymer
matrices. A desired nanofiller dispersion can be achieved simply by
selecting a sufficient number of P & F cycles. Because of the
fine microstructural control enabled by P & F, mechanical reinforcements
close to the theoretical maximum and independent of nanofiller loading
(up to 74 vol %) were obtained. We propose a universal model for the
P & F dispersion process that is parametrized on an experimentally
quantifiable “D factor”. The model
represents a general guideline for the optimization of nanocomposites
with enhanced functionalities including sensing, heat management,
and energy storage.

Facing technological
challenges
in fields such as transportation, soft robotics, biomedical, and wearable
electronics will require the availability of materials able to simultaneously
bear loads and integrate multiple functionalities such as sensing,
adaptation, responsiveness, energy harvesting, and communication.1 Polymer nanocomposites are promising candidates
for meeting these requests because they employ nanoparticles having
exceptional intrinsic properties. Graphene,2 for instance, has been proven to possess exceptional mechanical
properties,3 excellent gas-barrier properties,4 high charge-carrier mobility and high thermal
conductivity,5,6 and visual transparency.7 However, it has proven to be difficult to exploit
the intrinsic properties of the embedded nanoparticles: the performance
of nanocomposites are often disappointing and well below theoretical
predictions. For example, according to classical composite theories,8 we would expect graphene nanocomposites to exhibit
extraordinary mechanical performance. However, only a very limited
number of papers have reported nanocomposites standing up to these
expectations.9−12 Good performance and agreement with the theory is usually observed
for very low nanofiller contents only (below 1 vol %).8 However, this is the range in which the absolute performance
is low, questioning the use of nanoparticles in place of more-conventional
alternatives. The issue lies in the following dilemma: the smaller
the material’s size, the more appealing its intrinsic properties
but also the more difficult the control over the nanoparticle dispersion
quality during processing.13,14

However, nanocomposites
are readily found in nature, and their
intrinsic performance can surpass that of the best man-made composites.
For instance, nacre, often taken as the golden standard in structured
composites, combines CaCO3 “bricks” and protein
“mortar” in a layered microstructured composite ∼3000
times tougher than each of nacre’s components.15 The hierarchical structure of nacre is believed to be the
key to its properties. Hence, researchers have attempted to exploit
nanoparticle properties by developing methods to obtain better microstructural
control. The best resulting nanocomposites have demonstrated high
mechanical performances,9−12 unusual interaction with light,16,17 resistance to flammability,18−22 self-regulating heating,23,24 energy management,25−27 high electrical and thermal conductivity,28 and sensing and structural health monitoring.29−32

However, the control over
nanoparticle dispersion is usually compromised
for high filler loading,11,12,33−37 making it impossible to exploit the desired large nanofiller–polymer
interfacial area.38 As a consequence, nanocomposites
often contain nanoparticle agglomerates that dramatically reduce performance11,12,33,39 unless they were prepared by bottom-up, but hardly scalable, approaches.40−42

To overcome the dichotomy between nanofiller loading and dispersion
(and, hence, properties), herein we present an iterative materials
processing technique (P & F) that draws inspiration from the process
of preparation of puff pastry to make croissants (Figure 1a). This technique can create
nanocomposites with well-defined nanofiller dispersion levels without
the loss of dispersion efficiency, even at ultra-high nanofiller loadings.
This is not achievable by traditional solution-mixing or melt-blending
techniques. Moreover, we propose an analytical model that quantitatively
correlates nanocomposite properties with nanofiller dispersion level.
To prove the potential of the P & F technique, we produce nanocomposites
with exceptional combination of functionalities, including energy
management, self-heating, and strain sensing.

Results and Discussion
Micromechanical Considerations
and Modeling of the P & F
Dispersion Process
The P & F technique is based on the
addition of nanoparticles (i.e., graphite nanoplatelets,
GNP) in between two polymer films (i.e., linear-low
density polyethylene, LLDPE; Figure 1b, left), followed by the application of P & F
cycles (Figure 1b,
right) an arbitrary number of times. Each P & F cycle is composed
of a folding step in which an approximately circular GNP-containing
layer is folded twice to produce a quadrant slice and a pressing step
executed at a temperature slightly above the polymer melting point
(≅120◦C for LLDPE). The pressing step produces
a strong flow that simultaneously breaks down the agglomerates, aligns
the dispersed particles, and substantially increases the GNP–LLDPE
contact area, yielding a well-mixed dispersion after a number of cycles.
The P & F process implements Baker’s transformation43 (Figure 1a, right) at very high applied viscous stresses.

As
shown in Figure 1c,
after a few P & F cycles the color of the nanocomposites becomes
homogeneous to the naked eye (see also Figure S5). At small cycle numbers, the nanocomposites present large
GNP agglomerates (Figure 1d, left). The size of the agglomerates decreases with increasing
cycles (Figure 1e),
and many well-dispersed individual particles appear throughout the
samples, forming a layered structure (see further microstructural
observations in section S.7.1 of the Supporting Information). After 500 P & F cycles, the initial agglomerates
have mostly disappeared (Figure 1d, right), and the thickness of the dispersed particles
approaches that of individual GNP (∼30 nm, see section S.3 of the Supporting Information for
GNP characterizations).

The combined effect of dispersion and
orientation obtained by P
& F cannot be reached by conventional melt processing like twin-screw
melt-compounding or multilayer co-extrusion44 (which is also based on the Baker’s transformation). The
flow has a dominant extensional component that orients the particles
with their flat faces perpendicular to the pressing direction. The
squeeze flow in the thin gap between the plates produces large shear
rates. Such high shear rates may not be achievable by conventional
multilayer co-extrusion because the materials are processed at temperatures
much higher than the polymer melting point, otherwise they will hardly
flow through the extrusion line. By solving the velocity profile for
a power-law fluid using the lubrication approximation, we estimate
the volume-averaged shear rate magnitude during each P & F cycle
to be between γ̇ = 12 s–1 and
γ̇ = 1150 s–1 in the final
stages of compression, depending on whether the polymer is assumed
to slip freely from the wall or to adhere perfectly to it. Given the
high viscosity of the polymer (we are working just above the melting
temperature), the corresponding viscous stresses are large, between
3 kPa and 90 kPa (assuming 4.8 vol %; see section S.11.1 of the Supporting Information), and sufficient to break
down the initial aggregates (from the surface energy of graphene Γ≅70 mN/m
and the diameter of the platelets Dp, we
estimate the yield strength  of the initial aggregates to be
smaller
than 0.74 kPa; see section S.11.1 of the Supporting Information). The controlled flow in P & F has a further
crucial benefit. With conventional processing methods, characterized
by complex flow streamlines, the flow can promote re-agglomeration
rather than dispersion if converging streamlines are present that
force the particles to come into contact with each other. In contrast,
in the P & F approach, the dominant extensional flow increases
the particle separation at each cycle by “stretching”
the fluid containing the suspended platelets.

A key aspect of
the method is that after the pressing step has
ended, the shear rate goes practically to zero. As a consequence,
the sample viscosity increases dramatically, “freezing”
the microstructure (for samples at 120 °C containing 4.8 vol
% GNP, the viscosity increases from η ≅ 10 Pa·s
for γ̇ ≅ 10 s–1 to η
≅ 105 Pa·s for γ̇ ≅
10–3 s–1). Moreover, the
sample is cooled and folded at room temperature. Hence, once dispersed,
the platelets remain dispersed until the next pressing step. To quantify
the dispersion during the P & F process, we can define a dispersion
factor D as: 1  where A(n) and Ap are the nanofiller–matrix
contact area at cycle n and the total nanofiller
surface area, respectively. The D factor ranges from
0 for completely agglomerated GNPs to 1 for perfectly dispersed GNPs.
This parameter can either be measured indirectly [e.g., by analyzing scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively) images]39 or analytically derived a priori from
the preparation technique used (see section S.11.3 of the Supporting information for melt-blending and section S.11.4 of the Supporting Information for
solution mixing and casting).

By assuming that the variation
of D within a Δn interval
depends on a distribution rate I (a constant that
describes how fast the polymer melt erodes the
agglomerates and distributes the nanoparticles) and on a saturation
term Ap – A(n) (once all of the GNPs are in contact with LLDPE, D becomes 1 and cannot further increase; see section S.11.2 of the Supporting Information),
we can estimate that D changes with n according to: 2  where A0 is the
initial contact area. We calculate a pre-exponential factor (Ap – A0)/Ap of 0.999 by analyzing the optical pictures
of the samples at the first few cycles and a distribution rate I ≈ 3.3 × 10–3 using two different
methods (sections S.11.5 and S.11.6 of the Supporting Information): one based on the analysis of the optical pictures
of films prepared at low P & F cycles and the other one determined
by fitting the mechanical and electrical properties of the nanocomposites
presented later. We used eq 2 to convert the number of P & F cycles into a nanofiller
dispersion level on the top axis of Figures 1e and 2b,c. The knowledge of the dispersion
state allows the prediction of nanocomposite physical properties.

(bottom graph). (e) Representation of the nanocomposite microstructures
with the polymer-rich and GNP-rich zones.

Prediction of Nanocomposite Properties for Different Dispersion
Levels
Nanocomposite physical properties can be parametrized
on D assuming that the effective nanofiller loading Vpeff scales with the nominal nanofiller loading Vp in the same way as the area does: 3  

The effective volume fraction can be
used to replace Vp inside theoretical
models for composites (such as the Halpin–Tsai model45,46 for the elastic modulus or the Pukanszky model47 for the yield stress), provided that the nanofiller dispersion
level is known, or to back-calculate an unknown D factor. Any physical properties P that follows
the rule-of-mixture,48,49 such as the Young’s modulus
or the thermal conductivity, can be expressed (see section S.11.2 of the Supporting Information) as: 4  where P0 is the
value of P for D = 0, and Pth is the value of P when the
nanofiller is perfectly dispersed. In contrast, properties that are
very sensitive to percolation, such as the electrical conductivity
σ, are expected to follow an exponential relation (section S.11.2 of the Supporting Information): 5  where σth is the theoretical
conductivity at high dispersion levels, σM is the
maximum conductivity reached at a critical nanofiller dispersion level Dc, and a is a parameter that
describes how fast the conductivity changes with interparticle distance
(and thus with the dispersion level). In the next section, we will
explain this correlation between nanofiller dispersion and electrical
conductivity in more detail. Despite their simplicity, eqs 4–6 are very useful for
both interpreting nanocomposites physical properties and predictions
and materials design.

Effect of GNP Dispersion Level on Nanocomposite
Properties
Figure 2a shows
representative stress–strain curves corresponding to different
P & F cycles for samples containing 4.8 vol % GNP. The mechanical
reinforcement Ec/Em (ratio between elastic modulus Ec of the composite and elastic modulus of the matrix, with Em = 140 ± 5 MPa), the stress at yield Y, and the stress at break B are improved
by nanofiller dispersion (Figure 2b), as expected from previous studies.39,50 Because the yield stress depends also on the nanofiller specific
surface area,38 its increase compared to
neat LLDPE (7.85 ± 0.27 MPa) is likely explained by an increasing
nanofiller–matrix interfacial area with P & F cycles. However,
nanofiller dispersion may change also the crystallinity and the spherulitic
and lamellar features of the polymer, which, in turn, can further
affect the nanocomposite mechanical properties. In sections S.4 and S.5 of the Supporting Information, we show
that these changes are negligible for our samples, so any mechanical
improvement must be mainly caused by an increased nanofiller–polymer
interface. The stress at break overtakes the value of neat LLDPE (9.5
± 0.7 MPa) only after 150 P & F cycles; for this number of
cycles, the failure of initiation due to stress concentrations generated
by GNP agglomerates is overcome (see fracture surfaces in section S.7.2 of the Supporting Information).
For comparison, a reference sample containing 4.8 vol % GNP prepared
by melt-blending followed by compression-molding presents mechanical
properties as low as those of samples prepared between 100 and 150
P & F cycles (Figure 2b and section S.8 of the Supporting Information). This is believed to be mainly due to the reduced in-plane alignment
of the GNP nanoparticles.

The anisotropic microstructure observed
by SEM is reflected in the electrical properties (Figure 2c): the in-plane conductivity
is approximately 4 orders of magnitude higher than the out-of-plane
conductivity. The in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities of samples
prepared with less than 50 P & F cycles are not measurable, suggesting
well-isolated GNP agglomerates inside the matrix. Between 50 and 150
P & F cycles, the dispersion of the particles leads to an optimally
conductive network, and the conductivities reach a maximum (this rise
in conductivity with the nanofiller dispersion agrees with several
literature observations).39,52,53 The conductivities then decrease at higher P & F cycles, suggesting
a breakup of the percolating network. This other behavior agrees with
the results of Tkalya et al., who reported increased
percolation thresholds in nanocomposites with improved graphene dispersions.54 The reduction in electrical conductivity can
also be explained by a partial fragmentation of GNP. This effect,
however, should be less dominant than the nanofiller dispersion/distribution
effect because there is no evidence of a reduction of mechanical properties
with P & F cycles. Notably, a reference sample prepared by melt-blending
and compression molding (also containing 4.8 vol % GNP) is not electrically
conductive.

To better understand the reasons behind the trend
of the electrical
conductivities with the P & F cycles, we refer to the study of
Wang et al., who developed a conductivity model based
on the continuum theory that takes into account the effects of nanofiller
agglomeration, imperfect nanofiller–matrix interface, and electron
tunnelling.51 Because of the GNP agglomerates,
the volume of nanocomposites must be divided into two different zones:
a GNP-rich zone and a polymer-rich zone (Figure 2e). The size of the GNP-rich zones may not
be the same of those reported in Figure 1e for the GNP agglomerates: the GNP-rich
zones (represented by violet areas in Figure 2e as opposed to the blue contours used to
denote the agglomerates and individual GNP that can be measured by
SEM) can consists also of well-dispersed GNP that are just well close
to each other so that their local concentration is higher than Vp. Assuming that the polymer-rich zone does
not contain any GNP, the GNP concentration inside the GNP-rich zones
is VGNP = Vp/Vg,51 where Vg is the volume fraction of the GNP-rich zones
inside the nanocomposites. The value of Vg must increase from Vp at the first few
P & F cycles to one at very high cycles, where there is no more
distinction between GNP-rich and polymer-rich zones (Figure 2e). Unfortunately, there is
no direct way to measure the size of the GNP-rich zones. However,
considering that the P & F dispersion mechanism involves repetitive
extensional flows, it is reasonable to expect that the GNP-rich zones
increase their aspect-ratio ξg with the number of
P & F cycles. Based on the model of Wang et al.,51 when ξg is higher
than the aspect ratio ξGNP of the individual GNP,
the overall electrical percolation decreases and the conductivity
of the nanocomposites increases. Indeed, approximating their model,
the nanocomposite conductivity σ is controlled by the electrical
percolation between the GNP-rich zones: 6  where Vgc is the critical volume fraction
of the GNP-rich zones, and σg is
their conductivity, which is based in turn on the percolation of the
GNP within the GNP-rich zones: 7  where VGNPc is the critical
volume fraction of the GNP inside the GNP-rich zones. Some literature
studies55,56 suggest that the critical volume fractions
are inversely correlated to the filler aspect ratio: Vgc ∝
1/ξg and VGNPc ∝ 1/ξGNP and,
hence, the reason why ξg must be higher than ξGNP to enhance the conductivity of nanocomposites. Using eq 7 inside eq 6, we can simulate the trend of nanocomposite
conductivity with P & F cycles (Figure 2d, where we assumed a linear increment of Vg and ξg with P & F cycles).
This trend is quite similar to that of data in Figure 2c and to the model of eq 5. Therefore, the parameter Dc of eq 5 represents the situation in which there is the best compromise between
ξg and VGNP during the
P & F process that gives the maximum possible conductivity, σM: Dc ∝ VGNP/ξg and σM ∝
ξGNP/Dc.

In summary,
our nanocomposites can be divided in three categories
according to the nanofiller dispersion state: (1) nanocomposites with D < 15% containing inhomogeneous GNP distribution and
isolated GNP agglomerates that do not form an electrically conductive
network and for which the mechanical properties are comparable with
or worse than those of the neat LLDPE; (2) nanocomposites with 15%
< D < 50% containing well-dispersed and aligned
GNPs, showing high and anisotropic conductivities and good mechanical
reinforcement; and (3) nanocomposites with D >
50%
presenting highly dispersed and aligned GNP, having enhanced mechanical
properties but poor electrical conductivity. The combination of electrical
and mechanical properties is thus a strong function of the parameter D.

Toward Ultrahigh Nanofiller Loadings
Figure 3a compares
values found in
literature52,57−61 for the reinforcement of layered nanocomposites of
LLDPE and GNP/graphene with theoretical predictions using the Halpin–Tsai
model, which assumes “optimally dispersed” systems.
None of the literature data sets follow the linear trend expected
from the theory: the data sets show the typical reduction in reinforcing
efficiency with nanofiller loading, commonly attributed to decreasing
nanofiller dispersion quality as the concentration of nanoparticle
increases. Here, we examine the properties of nanocomposites prepared
at 200 P & F cycles (LLDPE and GNP are not affected by such high
cycles, as demonstrated in section S.9 in the Supporting Information) as a function of GNP loading.

Figure 3 Properties
of LLDPE nanocomposites for different GNP loadings but
similar dispersion level (48.2%). (a) Mechanical reinforcement of
GNP–LLDPE nanocomposites from literature, together with prediction
lines of the Halpin–Tsai model at different aspect ratios ξ
of monolayer graphene. The shadowed areas are a guide for the eye
to highlight the decrease of reinforcing efficiency with nanofiller
loading. For some cases, there are two data sets per reference corresponding
to nanocomposites prepared by different techniques or with different
matrix and nanofiller functionalization. (b) Mechanical reinforcement
and yield stress of GNP–LLDPE nanocomposites for n = 200 P & F cycles. The frame corresponding to low-volume fractions
indicates the region where literature data typically fall (see Figure 3a). Because of the
high GNP loading that increases nanocomposite brittleness, the sample
containing 35 vol % GNP does not show any yield before fracture. The
modified Halpin–Tsai and Pukanszky models modified by eq 3 fit the reinforcement
and yield data. In both fits, the D factor was kept
constant at 48.2% (value found for previous nanocomposites containing
4.8 vol % GNP prepared at n = 200). (c) Electrical
conductivity of GNP–LLDPE nanocomposites prepared with n = 200 (lines are guides for the eye) and thermal conductivity
enhancement with respect to the value obtained for LLDPE, km. (d) In-plane electrical conductivity of LLDPE–GNP
nanocomposites. Note the high in-plane conductivity of 0.3 S/cm for
the sample at 35 vol % obtained via P & F.

We find that the mechanical reinforcement vs volume
fraction data for P & F (representative stress–strain curves
can be found in Figure S10) can be well-fitted
by the Halpin–Tsai and Pukanszky models using Vpeff with a fixed value of D = 48.2% (Figure 3). The model parameters correspond to a nanofiller aspect-ratio of
43 (in agreement with the theoretical one, ξth =
38, from the fit in Figure 1e) and nanofiller–matrix interaction parameter BPuk of 14.4, similar to values reported for
clay nanocomposites.62 Considering that
no compatibiliser was used, the high value of the parameter BPuk suggests a fairly good GNP–LLDPE
interaction. These results demonstrate that the dispersion efficiency
of the P & F technique (and, hence, the resulting reinforcement)
does not decrease at high nanofiller loadings (i.e., D factor remains constant), contrary to what is
usually reported (Figure 3a).

The in-plane conductivity of our samples is 4 orders
of magnitude
higher than the out-of-plane conductivity (Figure 3c). This reflects the anisotropic layered
microstructure of the nanocomposite. Considering the aspect ratio
of our GNP (∼40), we should expect a percolation threshold
around 15 vol % if GNP were perfectly dispersed.55 The measured percolation threshold lies between 2.1 and
4.8 vol % (Figure 3c). This range is theoretically expected for perfectly dispersed
nanoplatelets with aspect ratios of 150–250. Therefore, the
nonhomogeneous, imperfect GNP dispersion (D ≈
50%) in our nanocomposites increases the electrical conductivity (as
depicted in Figure 2c), hence lowering the percolation threshold to values theoretically
expected for higher aspect-ratio fillers. This result corroborates
our conductivity model of eq 5.

The high electrical conductivities come with massive
in-plane thermal
conductivity enhancements: >10 W/m·K, more than 3000% higher
than LLDPE thermal conductivity. The out-of-plane conductivity increases
up to ∼1 W/m·K. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the highest combination of thermal conductivity enhancement and thermal
anisotropy ever reported. A comparison of the in-plane electrical
conductivity data with the values found in the literature53,59,63−66 for layered nanocomposites of
LLDPE with GNP/graphene (Figure 3d) shows how our samples are the most-conductive nanocomposites
reported. It is noted that the conductivity is predicted to be even
higher for a D-factor close to Dc ≈ 25%.

Material Multifunctional Design and General
Applicability of
the Approach
The P & F approach addresses the optimization
of nanocomposite microstructures to fulfill particular technological
applications. For example, a layered microstructure with perfectly
dispersed nanoparticles is needed for materials with enhanced mechanical,
gas-barrier, or thermal properties, e.g., films for
food packaging and flexible electronics67,68 and heat-dissipating
devices.28 We measured the thermal conductivity
of polymer nanocomposites with 4.8 vol % GNP after 400 P & F cycles.
Unexpectedly, thermal conductivities were ∼3 W/m·K in-plane
(∼900% higher than neat LLDPE thermal conductivity) and ∼0.3
W/m·K out-of-plane while being electrically insulating in all
directions (average interparticle distance longer than electron mean
free path).69 The combination of high thermal
conductivity and low electrical conductivity makes these nanocomposites
promising for anisotropic thermal interface management of modern electronic,
optoelectronic and photonic devices.69

High dispersion levels can be useful for energy-storage devices25,26 (Figure 4a), provided
that the electrical conductivity (σth) is small enough
to allow huge polarization effects inside the layered microstructure
without dielectric loss. A much-lower nanofiller dispersion (corresponding
to the critical level Dc) is sufficient
if high electrical conductivity is required, for example, in Joule-heating
materials (Figure 4b) for de-icing70 or safety self-limiting
power devices.23,24 An intermediate level of electrical
conductivity, close to that corresponding to the percolation threshold,
is normally required for resistive sensors (Figure 4c, for instance, shows the strain sensitivity
of the nanocomposite) that could find applications in smart textile
and structural health-monitoring applications.29,30

dispersion) for a variety of applications. (a) Imaginary (Z′′) vs real impedance (Z′) obtained from electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy of LLDPE containing 4.8 vol % GNP for different
dispersion levels. In accordance with value of σth expected from eq 5 the
sample with D = 80.6% is the only one showing a capacitive
effect, demonstrated by the Nyquist semicircle. (b) Self-heating originating
from the Joule effect of LLDPE composites at different GNP loadings
and dispersion levels. The sample with 4.8 vol % GNP shows a better
self-heating effect than the sample containing 7.4 vol % GNP because
its nanofiller dispersion level (D = 28) is closer
to the critical value Dc= 25% predicted
by eq 5. (c) Strain sensing
of LLDPE composites with different GNP loadings and dispersion levels.
High values of D give high resistance variations
(gauge factor of ∼30) because the nanocomposite conductivity
approaches the theoretical value σth more quickly
with the strain (see sample containing 4.8 vol % GNP with D = 48.2%). Dispersions closer to Dc provide better electrical signals. The resistance variation
becomes less evident for increasing amounts of GNP because the difference
between σM and σth is smaller (for
details, see section S.12.2 in the Supporting Information). (d) Optical picture (top left) of LLDPE containing
70 wt % MMT (∼10 cm wide and ∼400 μm thick), SEM
cross-sections (bottom), and comparison (top right) of mechanical
reinforcement with literature values for MMT nanocomposites grouped
by the processing method. We achieved the highest mechanical reinforcement
ever reported for melt processing. The QMUL logo is used with permission.

If a combination of properties
is simultaneously desired, a compromise
in nanofiller dispersion needs to be found. We found a good balance
between mechanical and electrical properties when our GNP is ∼50%
dispersed. At high nanofiller loadings, the theoretical conductivity
at high dispersion states (σth) should not be very
different from that at the critical dispersion level (σM). Therefore, one should find good electrical properties even
if the nanofiller dispersion is greater than Dc. This is the case for our nanocomposites prepared with more
than 20 vol % GNP, which appear to be simultaneously promising for
self-heating devices triggered by low voltages (Figure 4b), health monitoring (Figure 4c), and mechanical applications.

To
prove the general applicability of our technique to different
filler–matrix combinations, a number of different nanocomposites
were prepared by dispersing using P & F four types of nanoparticles
of different shapes and sizes (GNP with low specific surface area,
GNP with high specific surface area, montmorillonite MMT, and magnetite
nanoparticles) into five different polymeric matrices. Independent
from the specific filler–matrix system selected, nanofillers
could always be efficiently dispersed into a given polymer matrix
after a sufficient number of P & F cycles (section S.11.6 of the Supporting Information).
The performance of the resulting material is extremely promising.
Let us take a LLDPE containing MMT nanocomposite for example. Because
we found a distribution rate of ∼7 × 10–2 for MMT in LLDPE (much higher than ∼3 × 10–3 for GNP), we expected to reach a dispersion of ∼99% after
only ∼50 P & F cycles. Therefore, we prepared a sample
containing an ultrahigh MMT loading of ∼74 wt %, and it appeared
to be transparent indeed (Figure 4d) because of the good MMT dispersion and alignment.
The nanocomposite had a Young’s modulus of ∼1.8 GPa,
approximately 13 times higher than that of the pure polymer. This
is a surprisingly high value for a nanocomposite based on a commodity
or engineering plastic prepared by a top-down technique (Figure 4d and section S.12.4 of the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
The lack of control over nanofiller dispersion,
exacerbated at
high nanofiller loadings, has often prevented nanocomposites from
fulfilling multifunctional requirements. In this study, we have demonstrated
a top-down scalable polymer processing method, the P & F method,
that can enable the dispersion of ultrahigh concentrations of nanofiller
(at least up to 74 vol %) by selecting a sufficient number of P &
F cycles. With this method, we have been able to achieve mechanical
reinforcements close to the maximum theoretical prediction levels,
independent of nanofiller loading. Key aspects of the method are the
controlled mixing, the use of a strong flow with a dominant elongational
component, and the processing at temperatures just above the melting
temperature. As an example of the potential of the method to optimize
microstructures to achieve multifunctional properties, we have produced
nanocomposites by P & F simultaneously presenting enhanced mechanical
reinforcement, strain sensing, self-heating, and energy-management
properties.

Methods
Linear low-density polyethylene
(density of 0.921 g/cm3 and melting point of 116 °C),
Flexirene MS20A (Versalis S.p.A.,
Italy), and the GNP (an expanded graphite of bulk density of 0.04
g/cm3 and BET specific surface area of 25 m2/g) Timrex C-Therm 002 (Timcal Ltd., Switzerland), were used as polymer
matrix and nanofiller, respectively.

The P & F technique
used to prepare the nanocomposites can
be divided in three steps. First, two LLDPE films (∼100 μm
thick) were prepared by hot-pressing polymer pellets inside a hot
press (Collin P 300 E). Subsequently, GNP powder was deposited with
a spatula in the middle of the surface of one LLDPE film so that the
other film could be placed on top preventing the powder from spilling
out. This “sandwich” was then hot-pressed inside of
an aluminum frame (∼300 μm thick) at 40 bar and 120 °C
for 30 s to join the two materials. In the final processing step,
LLDPE and GNP were gradually dispersed by repetitive folding and hot-pressing
these films. In particular, at each P & F cycle, the sample was
manually folded twice in a symmetric manner and pressed at 40 bar
and 120 °C for 30 s inside the aluminum frame to maintain the
resulting thickness at ∼300 μm after the pressing. The
weight concentration of GNP inside each sample was calculated by measuring
the weight of the initial LLDPE films before and after adding GNP
(after the second step).

To study the properties of the nanocomposites
as a function of
P & F cycles
(corresponding to GNP dispersion and distribution throughout the matrix),
samples of LLDPE containing 10.7 wt % (4.8 vol %) of GNP were prepared
at different P & F cycles. To study the effect of possible degradation
of the polymer matrix with the P & F cycles, samples of neat LLDPE at 1, 50, 100,
and 150 P & F cycles were also prepared.

A reference sample
of LLDPE containing 10.7 wt % of GNP was prepared
by traditional melt-blending followed by a compression molding technique.
Here, LLDPE pellets and GNP were used without drying. The composite
was prepared by melt-blending at 120 °C under nitrogen atmosphere
using a DSM X’plore 15 cm3 micro compounder. Compounding
was performed for 9 min at a screw speed of 180 rpm. The resulting
compound was hot-pressed at 40 bar and 120 °C for 30 s inside
an aluminum frame ∼300 μm thick.

Finally, samples
of 0.5, 5, 10.7, 16, 43.6, and 56 wt % (corresponding
to 0.21, 2.1, 4.8, 7.4, 24, and 35 vol %) of GNP were prepared at
200 P & F cycles to validate the effectiveness of this technique
in dispersing different concentrations of nanofiller. It was chosen
to prepare all samples at 200 P & F cycles because we found that
this number of cycles gave optimal mechanical properties, which were
even higher than those of the reference sample prepared by melt-blending,
whereas electrical conductivity values were among the highest reported
in literature.

The methods used to characterize the nanofiller,
matrix, and nanocomposites
are described in the Supporting Information. Methods used to test the self-heating effect, strain-sensing, and
impedance and energy storage are also reported in the Supporting Information.
