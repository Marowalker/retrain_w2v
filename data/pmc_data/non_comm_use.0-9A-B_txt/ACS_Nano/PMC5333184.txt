Nanoscale materials
are promising for optoelectronic devices because
their physical dimensions are on the order of the wavelength of light.
This leads to a variety of complex optical phenomena that, for instance,
enhance absorption and emission. However, quantifying the performance
of these nanoscale devices frequently requires measuring absolute
absorption at the nanoscale, and remarkably, there is no general method
capable of doing so directly. Here, we present such a method based
on an integrating sphere but modified to achieve submicron spatial
resolution. We explore the limits of this technique by using it to
measure spatial and spectral absorptance profiles on a wide variety
of nanoscale systems, including different combinations of weakly and
strongly absorbing and scattering nanomaterials (Si and GaAs nanowires,
Au nanoparticles). This measurement technique provides quantitative
information about local optical properties that are crucial for improving
any optoelectronic device with nanoscale dimensions or nanoscale surface
texturing.

==== Body
A number
of techniques to measure
quantitative absorptance on single nanostructures exist,1−3 such as photothermal spectroscopy,4−7 extinction (modulation) spectroscopy,8−10 and scattered field interferometry.11 Although some of these techniques are extremely sensitive and can
even measure single molecules,5,12 they also rely on at
least one of the following assumptions: (i) all absorbed power turns
into heat; (ii) the nanoparticle does not scatter light; or (iii)
it interacts with light as a dipole. Hence, to date, there is no generally
applicable method available for quantitative absorption measurements
of nanostructures, even though, for instance, nanostructured semiconductor
and plasmonic hot-electron optoelectronic devices13,14 require such a technique to quantify their performance.

Here,
we show that by combining an integrating sphere with a microscope
objective with an ultralong working distance, we can achieve submicron
spatial resolution inside the integrating sphere. As a result, quantitative
local absorptance measurements can be obtained, even on single nanostructures.
We have recently used this method to measure strongly absorbing nanowires
either to verify core–shell nanowire antenna properties or
for internal quantum efficiency measurements.15,16 Now, we detail the working mechanism and explore the limits of the
technique using weakly absorbing but strongly scattering structures
(silicon nanowire and a large gold nanoparticle), a weakly absorbing
and weakly scattering structure (small gold nanoparticle), and a strongly
absorbing and strongly scattering structure (GaAs nanowire). Additionally,
we demonstrate the spatial resolution with absorption maps on a highly
tapered nanowire, where resonances can be seen moving along the length
as a function of wavelength.

Single nanoparticle spectroscopy
relies on illumination with a
focused beam to enhance the interaction with the nanoparticle. When
illuminating a nanoparticle, part of the power will be absorbed or
scattered by the nanoparticle (Pabs and Psca; see Figure 1a). Additionally, even for a focused beam, the majority
of the incident power will typically not interact with the nanoparticle
and be either transmitted or reflected (PT and PR). Just as with the standard integrating
sphere method,17,18 integrating sphere microscopy
relies on determining the scattered and transmitted light. Due to
the diffuse and highly reflective surface of an integrating sphere,
this transmitted and scattered light quickly randomizes and covers
the inside of the integrating sphere with equal intensity. This homogenized
intensity also reaches a photodetector attached to the integrating
sphere, which thus detects a power proportional to the total transmitted
and scattered power that is independent of the exact scattering pattern.
Through a reference measurement (which has no absorbing structure),
the absolute transmitted and scattered power can then be determined
(see Supporting Information for more details
on the setup). Note that no distinction can be made between transmitted
and scattered power inside the integrating sphere, and it is therefore
not possible to determine the extinction cross section simultaneously.

Figure 1 Schematic
of the integrating sphere setup. (a) When illuminating
a nanoparticle with a focused beam, the nanoparticle takes power from
the incident beam and absorbs (Pabs) or
scatters (Psca) it. Most of the power
is just reflected (PR) or transmitted
(PT). In an integrating sphere, the scattered
(Psca) and transmitted light (PT) are both detected, so that by combining that
signal with the reflected signal (PR)
the absorptance can be determined. (b) Schematic depiction of the
combination of microscope objective and integrating sphere. The objective
focuses light on the sample holder inside the integrating sphere,
and the photodetector is behind a baffle on the backside of the integrating
sphere. The sample extends outside of the integrating sphere through
a small port, where the sample is mounted on a piezoelectric stage
for sample movement. (c) Schematic diagram for the experimental setup,
including reflection photodetector (PD) and half-wave plate (λ/2)
to control the polarization. BS stands for beam splitter and BM for
beam monitor, which we use to account for fluctuations in laser power.
NA stands for the numerical aperture of the objective.

To combine integrating sphere measurements with
submicron spatial
resolution, we combined an integrating sphere with a microscope objective.15,16,19 This microscope objective focuses
the light on the sample inside the integrating sphere (see Figure 1b). The sample is
mounted on a 3D piezoelectric stage, which allows scanning of the
sample to obtain quantitative local information on the absorptance.
The ability to scan the sample or focused spot position is crucial:
without scanning, integrating sphere microscopy can only be used in
a wide field configuration, which does not allow for quantitative
spatial information.19

A detector
behind a baffle on the backside of the integrating sphere
measures most of the transmitted and scattered power; some light will
be reflected or backscattered into the microscope objective. This
fraction is imaged on a second photodetector by the microscope objective
and is therefore also collected (see Figure 1c). Hence, by measuring the scattered, reflected,
and transmitted light, the absorbed light can be inferred: Pabs = 1 – PR – PT – Psca. More specifically, for the absorptance, we then obtain 1  where R and Rref are the reflection signal and reference measurement
and IS and ISref are the integrating sphere signal and
reference measurement. Calibration of the technique is thus extremely
simple: it only requires two reference measurements, usually a mirror
for Rref and a small hole in the substrate
for ISref (meaning that the beam misses the sample, but
the sample is still in the integrating sphere). The experimental setup
is discussed in more detail in the Supporting Information. Note that some samples can be strongly backscattering,
and it is therefore important to record the reflected power (see Supporting Information for examples).

In eq 1, C is
an offset that arises from the reflection of the substrate–air
interface on the back of the substrate, which the objective collects,
but is so far beyond the focal plane that it is not imaged on the
photodetector. For glass substrates, it is ∼0.03 (see Supporting Information), but it depends slightly
on how much power is transmitted and scattered forward, and a small
error is therefore introduced by assuming that it is constant. The
accuracy of the technique additionally depends on the detection efficiency
of all nonabsorbed light; for example, if some light is scattered
but not detected by either photodetector, it will appear as absorption.
Based on measurements on nonabsorbing but strongly scattering silica
beads, we estimate that 95 ± 1.2% of the total scattered power
is collected.16 Finally, broadband characterization
is possible since we use a supercontinuum laser as a light source
(400–2000 nm), and the integrating sphere inner surface remains
Lambertian from 250 to 2500 nm.

Results and Discussion
We will now demonstrate this technique by showing local variation
in the absorptance of a tapered silicon nanowire. Semiconductor nanowires
are important building blocks for optoelectronics applications,20 including nanowire solar cells,21,22 light-emitting diodes,23−25 lasers,26 and quantum information technology.27 Silicon nanowires, in particular, provide a challenging test case
for nanoscale absorption measurements because the indirect band gap
leads to scattering that can be 2 orders of magnitude stronger than
the absorption. Figure 2a shows an scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a 10 μm
long silicon nanowire on a glass substrate. The nanowire is slightly
tapered, with a diameter that varies from 160 nm at the top of the
image to 95 nm at the bottom. Figure 2b displays the absorptance A (absorbed
fraction of the incident power, Pabs/Pin) at a wavelength of 450 nm, measured while
scanning over the area shown in the SEM image using the 3D piezoelectric
stage. In the center of the wire, a peak in absorptance is visible,
which corresponds to resonantly enhanced absorption via a Mie (geometrical) resonance. Mie resonances shift to longer wavelengths
as the radius of the wire is increased, as they occur for approximately
fixed values of the product nk0r, where n, k0, and r are the refractive index, free space wavenumber,
and radius, respectively.28,29 The absorption maps
in Figure 2c–f
show the peak moving from smaller to larger diameter along the tapered
nanowire as the illumination wavelength increases, providing a direct
visualization of these diameter-dependent resonance phenomena.

Figure 2 Absorptance

nanowire under consideration. Its diameter ranges from 95 (bottom)
to 160 nm (top). The scale bar is 2 μm. (b–f) Absorptance
maps over the same spatial range for different wavelengths. For all
maps, the laser polarization is aligned with the long axis of the
nanowire. The absorption peak shows how the TM12 and TM21 resonances shift position along the wire as the wavelength
increases, and the TM11 is seen to appear on the bottom
side of the wire. (g) Wavelength dispersion of the resonances of a
circular silicon nanowire in vacuum as a function of diameter, with
the absorptance spectra at different wavelengths superimposed. The
peaks in absorption along the length of the wire clearly correspond
to the presence of resonances.

Figure 2g
plots
absorption intensity line cuts along the tapered nanowire in Figure 2c–f, together
with calculated dispersion relations to identify the relevant Mie
resonances.30 These resonances can be specified
with the notation TMml, where TM indicates
the magnetic field is transverse to the long axis of the nanowire; m is the azimuthal mode number, corresponding to the number
of field maxima around the nanowire circumference; and l indicates the number of radial field maxima. From these calculations
shown in Figure 2g,
it is clear that we observe the TM21 and TM12 resonances. These resonances are nearly degenerate and hard to disentangle
spatially.

In addition to measuring nanoscale absorption maps
at a fixed wavelength,
we can also fix the laser position and measure local absorption spectra. Figure 3a shows an SEM image
of the same nanowire (but rotated) and indicates two positions where
spectra were measured. Figure 3b–e shows the wavelength-dependent absorption cross
sections of the nanowire at the two different positions, with the
laser polarized either along or orthogonal to the nanowire axis. A
geometric scaling factor is used to convert from absorptance to cross
section: , where A is
absorptance
and w0 is the beam radius. This factor
can be derived by assuming that the nanowire is infinitely thin and
then integrating the incident intensity along the nanowire.16 While the nanowire in reality is not infinitely
thin, agreement with full-wave simulations is good (see Figure 3b–e). However, because
the scattered power significantly exceeds the absorption by up to
a factor of 75, the disagreement between the measurement and full-wave
simulations is more likely due to the small fraction of scattered
light that is not detected.

silicon nanowire indicating the positions at which spectra were measured.
The scale bar is 1 μm. (b) Measured absorption cross section
of the silicon nanowire at position 1 with the electric field polarized
along the nanowire axis, compared to simulations of a nanowire on
glass with a diameter of 156 nm (blue line; see Methods). The inset shows the simulated absorption cross section (blue)
compared to the scattering cross section (red), indicating that the
wire scatters much more strongly than it absorbs. (c) Same as in panel
(b) but with the electric field polarized perpendicular to the axis.
(d,e) Same as panels (b) and (c) but measured at position 2 and with
112 nm diameter nanowire simulation. In (b–e), the error bars
are due to variance in the absorptance and uncertainty in the conversion
to cross section.

Due to the indirect band
gap of silicon, these nanowires scatter
very strongly, therefore providing a particularly challenging test
case. Agreement with theory is better for more strongly absorbing
materials such as GaAs, as we show in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows an SEM image of a GaAs nanowire with a radius
ranging from 110 nm at the top of the image to 84 nm at the bottom. Figure 4b–f shows
absorption maps for different wavelengths, just as for the silicon
nanowire. However, since this nanowire has a lower tapering angle,
the resonances do not appear localized along the nanowire length.
Additionally, the nanowire has a smaller diameter, which means that
a lower-order resonance is excited (the TM11 resonance),
which has a broader linewidth and, interestingly, therefore also a
larger spatial extent in a tapered nanowire than a resonance with
a narrower linewidth would have. Figure 4g,h shows the cross section versus wavelength, compared to full-wave simulations of the nanowire absorption
and scattering cross section for parallel and perpendicular incident
polarizations, measured at the top of the wire. Both spectra show
a resonance at 480 nm, which are the TM11 and TE01 resonances in the parallel and perpendicular polarization, respectively.
Since GaAs has a direct band gap, the scattering cross section is
reduced and the absorption cross section is increased, indeed improving
the agreement with numerical predictions.

GaAs nanowire. The scale bar is 1 μm. (b–f) Absorption
maps from 460 to 540 nm. Due to the smaller diameter of the nanowire
and the lower tapering angle, the resonances appear to be less confined
along the length of the nanowire. (g,h) Absorption spectra with the
electric field parallel (g) and perpendicular (h) to the nanowire
axis. The solid red and dashed blue lines show full-wave simulations
of the scattering and absorption cross sections for a GaAs nanowire
with the same diameter (110 nm).

Due to the linear extent of the nanowire, the intersection
with
the focused spot is significant and measurements above the noise floor
are therefore easily achieved. To probe the detection limits of our
setup, we also investigate small spherical gold nanospheres with a
plasmon resonance near 500 nm. While the absorptance of the nanowires
reaches >10% easily, the absorptance of a 60 nm diameter gold sphere
will lie below 1% due to the small absorption cross section. Since
the nanoparticle is localized in three dimensions, we now obtain for
the absorptance (assuming that the nanoparticle can be treated as
a point) A = σabsI(x,y), where I(x,y) is the intensity in the Gaussian
spot. If the nanoparticle lies exactly in the focus, we obtain σabs = A × πw02/2, where we used I(x = 0, y = 0) = 2Pin/πw02 and A = Pabs/Pin. This absorption
cross section is shown in Figure 5a for a 60 nm diameter gold sphere and in Figure 5b for a 200 nm diameter
gold sphere. Even though the absorptance peaks at 0.5% for the 60
nm diameter nanosphere, the noise floor is low enough for accurate
determination of the absorption cross section. In fact, the error
margin shown in Figure 5 arises largely due to the determination of the Gaussian beam radius w0.

Absorption spectrum
of a 60 nm Au nanoparticle compared to Mie theory predictions for
absorption (dashed blue line) and scattering (red line). (b) Absorption
spectrum of a 200 nm Au nanoparticle compared to Mie theory calculations
for absorption and scattering (dashed blue and red lines, respectively).
The insets in both figures show representative gold particles along
with a 100 nm scale bar.

Even for the gold sphere of 60 nm, the signal-to-noise ratio
is
∼30, implying that smaller absorption cross sections can be
measured. The noise floor depends on the laser characteristics, photodetectors,
and detected optical power. While not the case in this experiment,
the noise floor could ultimately be determined by photon shot noise.
This would enable detection of absorption cross sections only a few
square nanometers large, similar to extinction spectroscopy.12,31

Conclusions
To conclude, we have introduced a technique
to perform quantitative
and spatially resolved absorption spectroscopy on single scattering
nanoparticles. The technique uses an integrating sphere to measure
directly the transmitted, reflected, and scattered power, allowing
for determination of the absorbed power. Calibration of the absorption
measurement is very straightforward, and no assumptions on the nature
of the scattering particle are required. We demonstrated integrating
sphere microscopy by mapping the absorption cross section of tapered
silicon and GaAs nanowires. These are essential characteristics for
many optoelectronic devices, in particular, for light-emitting diodes
and solar cells, but cannot be measured on the nanoscale with photothermal
spectroscopy or any other known method. We therefore believe that
this extension of the standard integrating sphere measurement to nanoscale
systems can be of great utility in nanoscale optoelectronics, single
nanoparticle spectroscopy, and other fields where quantitative and
high spatial resolution measurements are desired.

Methods
Experimental Setup
The light source
in the experiment
was a supercontinuum laser (Fianium WL-SC-390-3), which was made monochromatic
using an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF, Crystal Technologies,
with roughly 4 nm bandwidth). Power in the focused laser beam is on
the order of several microwatts. The long working distance objective
is a 17 mm working distance Mitutoyo M Apo Plan NIR 50× with
NA = 0.42. The integrating sphere is a LabSphere GPS-020-SL, modified
so that it can accommodate our objective lens. The photodetectors
are Thorlabs amplified Si detectors (PDA100A), read out by Stanford
Research Systems SR830 lock-in amplifiers. For the Au nanoparticle
measurements the IS photodetector was replaced by a passive Newport
818-UV photodetector, which has a lower noise level than the Thorlabs
transimpedance amplifiers. The transmission of the AOTF was digitally
modulated at 20 kHz with a 50% duty cycle for the nanowire measurements
and at 700 Hz for the Au nanoparticle measurements. The sample holder
was mounted on a Piezojena Tritor400 3D piezoelectric stage for high-resolution
scanning of the sample, while for rough alignment, the piezoelectric
stage was mounted on a Newport mechanical stage.

Sample Preparation
The silicon nanowires are grown
epitaxially on a silicon substrate by the vapor–liquid–solid
growth mechanism using an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition
system. The 40 nm gold colloids were used as catalysts. The growth
was conducted at 800 °C for 5 min with silicon tetrachloride
(SiCl4) as the precursor. The carrier gas flows during
growth were Ar = 200 sccm and H2 = 50 sccm, while only
75 sccm Ar gas flows directly through the SiCl4 precursor
bubbler (held at 0 °C in a temperature-controlled bath). Self-catalyzed
GaAs nanowires were grown by solid-source III–V molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) directly on p-type Si(100) substrates by solid-source
III–V Veeco MBE GEN-930. The NWs were grown with a Ga beam
equivalent pressure, V/III flux ratio, substrate temperature, and
growth duration of 8.7 × 10–8 Torr, 50, ∼630
°C, and 1 h, respectively. The substrate temperature was measured
by a pyrometer. The gold nanoparticles (60 and 200 nm diameter) were
acquired from BBI solutions.

Simulations
The nanowire cross section
simulations
were performed with Lumerical FDTD. The nanowire had a hexagonal shape
and was assumed to be infinitely long (simulations were 2D). The refractive
index of silicon and GaAs was based on tabulated data from Palik.32 In both the calculations of the dispersion diagrams
and simulations, the parallel momentum was assumed to be zero, treating
the wire as if illuminated under normal incidence. Considering the
low effective NA in the experiment, this is an accurate assumption.
