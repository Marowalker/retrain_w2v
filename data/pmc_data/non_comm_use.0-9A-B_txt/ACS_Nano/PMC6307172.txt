The application of
light-emitting field-effect transistors (LEFET)
is an elegant way of combining electrical switching and light emission
in a single device architecture instead of two. This allows for a
higher degree of miniaturization and integration in future optoelectronic
applications. Here, we report on a LEFET based on lead sulfide quantum
dots processed from solution. Our device shows state-of-the-art electronic
behavior and emits near-infrared photons with a quantum yield exceeding
1% when cooled. We furthermore show how LEFETs can be used to simultaneously
characterize the optical and electrical material properties on the
same device and use this benefit to investigate the charge transport
through the quantum dot film.

==== Body
Colloidal
quantum dots (CQDs),
deposited as a thin film, are a modern semiconducting material with
attractive optical and electronic properties and have been used in
a variety of devices including solar cells, light-emitting diodes
(LEDs), photodiodes, field-effect transistors (FETs), and microelectronic
circuits.1−6 Among the large variety of semiconducting CQDs that have been synthesized
over the last years, especially lead chalcogenide, such as PbS and
PbSe, CQDs received large attention because of their easy synthesis,
high material quality, and consequent large success as an active layer
of different optoelectronic devices.7−9 In particular, Pb-based
compounds have been dominating the research activities in CQD solar
cells, given their large band gap tunability and good transport properties.10−15 Solar cell power conversion efficiencies above 11% were reported,
showing the success of a large number of research activities devoted
to the improvement of the CQDs’ surface passivation16 as well as the device structure.1 Besides the large interest in solar cells and photodetectors
based on CQDs, their broadly tunable optical properties and the good
transport properties allow for the fabrication of different types
of optoelectronic devices, where light emission in the NIR is required.17 NIR light sources, especially when they can
be made of nanometer size, can have applications in very different
fields, e.g., the biomedical
one or visible light communications (VLC).18,19

A less explored optoelectronic device is the so-called light-emitting
field-effect transistor (LEFET), which simultaneously allows for current
switching and electroluminescence generation, potentially capable
of taking the roles of both LEDs and FETs in microelectronic circuits.20,21 Typically, LEFETs are based on ambipolar FETs, where the source
and the drain electrodes are able to inject both electrons and holes,
into the transport energy levels of the semiconducting material. There
are numerous reports of LEFETs made from organic materials or carbon
nanotubes;22−26 however, only electrolyte-gated LEFETs made from CQDs (QDLEFET)
and an example of CQD-based hybrid LED/LEFETs have been reported recently
(for comparison of the performance metrics of CQD-containing LEFETs
see Supplementary Table S1).27−29

Despite showing great performance in various devices, CQD
solids
require additional studies addressing challenges associated with the
nature of the material. Due to their large surface to volume ratio,
charge transport in Pb-based CQD FETs is influenced by the CQDs synthesis
strategies, device fabrication conditions, the stoichiometry of the
surface, and the nature of the ligands.14,30−33 For example, electron transport through a CQDs film can be affected
by electron trapping from oxygen or water adsorbates, deposited during
or after film casting.30 The imbalanced
stoichiometry of the surface of individual CQDs can strongly affect
the carrier mobility.31,34 Additionally, the nature of the
ligands in the CQDs film can shift their energy levels, affect charge
carrier mobility, and introduce additional charge traps, deteriorating
the transport.4,35

Important information on
the trap states and transport mechanism,
in general, can be obtained with low-temperature studies.36−38 CQD films typically exhibit a phonon-assisted hopping transport,
which is expected to become band-like in highly coupled CQD solids.37,39−41 Furthermore, phonon-assisted dissociation of excitons
was reported to dominate the temperature-dependent photoluminescence
of coupled PbS CQD films.42 Trap states
have been also reported to influence the photoluminescence emission
of these materials in particular at low temperature due to their shallow
nature.43−46 Trap-state fingerprints have furthermore been identified in the
mid-infrared spectral region in a recent photoinduced absorption study.33 The fabrication of CQD-based LEFETs thus not
only serves as a demonstration of a very interesting optoelectronic
device but also provides a powerful platform to study the transport
and material properties of the active layer.

Here we show the
first solid-gated purely quantum dot-based LEFET
(QDLEFET), made from widely used tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI)-treated
PbS CQDs. Infrared electroluminescence with a quantum efficiency above
1% is obtained for temperatures below 100 K. This external quantum
efficiency is ca. 4 orders of magnitude higher than
the one at room temperature. A combination of low-temperature charge
transport and electroluminescence generation measurements allows us
to determine the presence of hole trap states on the CQDs. Furthermore,
we show that measurements of the QDLEFET conductivity are well fitted
by a 2D Mott variable range hopping transport for electrons and show
a more complex behavior of the hole conductivity, influenced by thermal
activation of the hole-trapping states.

Results and Discussion
The schematic structure of a QDLEFET is shown in Figure 1A. CQD films were deposited
on top of borosilicate glass substrates with prepatterned gold electrodes,
to fabricate FETs in bottom contact/top gate configuration. The CQD
films were deposited by spin-casting using a layer-by-layer technique
with subsequent ligand exchange from the native oleic acid (OA) to
TBAI, which is one of the most widely used ligands for fabrication
of PbS optoelectronic devices.1,5,14 A thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was subsequently
spin-coated on top of the CQD film, before growing by atomic layer
deposition (ALD) of an aluminum oxide layer. Both layers together
form the gate dielectric. The use of PMMA decreases the achievable
gate capacitance, but prevents interaction between the active layer
and the chemically active aluminum precursor during the ALD process.
To complete the device, a gold top gate electrode was evaporated through
a shadow mask. After fabrication, the devices were annealed to improve
the charge transport of the CQD films. The device design allowed for
measuring both photoluminescence and electroluminescence from the
same CQD film.

An overview of the spectral characteristics of
the employed CQDs
is given in Figure 1B. The absorption peak for OA-capped CQDs in hexane is found at 1.53
eV (809 nm), corresponding to a diameter of the QDs of approximately
2.75 nm.47 The photoluminescence is shifted
down to 1.26 eV (985 nm), thus showing the large Stokes shift typical
for such small CQDs of this material. The origin of this Stokes shift
still remains debated in the literature and is often attributed to
the aggregations of the CQDs.48 Cast as
a TBAI-treated film after annealing, the CQDs exhibit their maximum
PL at an even lower energy of 0.84 eV (1480 nm), as a consequence
of the decreased confinement of the carrier wave function.49 The EL, measured from the QDLEFET, almost overlaps
with the PL spectrum. The absorbance spectrum demonstrates the first
excitonic peak with a broad absorption shoulder in the infrared region,
presumably caused by trap states, distributed in the band gap.

In the following, we shall discuss the device characteristics at
room temperature (RT), after which we shall consider the behavior
upon temperature variation to elucidate the working mechanisms of
the fabricated QDLEFETs.

Figure 1C shows
two NIR optical micrographs of the electroluminescence between the
source and drain electrode of our devices for the cases of a gate
voltage (VGS) of −3 V (top) and
+4 V (bottom). In the former case, the maximum emission intensity
lies closer to the source, while in the latter case it lies closer
to the drain electrode. Changing the gate voltage thus shifts the
zone of electron–hole recombination between the electrodes
through the center of the channel. This demonstrates that in QDLEFETs
we can exploit the main advantages of LEFETs compared to LEDs, i.e., the spatial control of the recombination
zone and ability to move it away from the electrodes to increase the
EL efficiency.50 To map this behavior in
more detail, we plotted the position of the maximum EL (blue circles)
and its full width at half-maximum (red squares) as a function of
the gate voltage in Figure 1D (VDS = 16 V). The QDLEFET drain
current is shown in Figure 1E as a function of the gate voltage (transfer curve). When
biased in saturation mode (large VDS),
the QDLEFET shows asymmetric ambipolar characteristics, with the conductivity
of the electron channel exceeding the hole conductivity. The emitted
electroluminescence was detected with a calibrated photodiode and
is also included in Figure 1E. Due to the large difference in the conductivity for electrons
and holes, the maximum of the detected EL power is observed for positive
gate voltages of approximately 1 to 5 V (for VDS from 8 to 14 V) and increases with the VDS due to a higher (drain) current injection. These bias
values correspond to the case where the recombination zone is already
close to the drain electrode. At larger gate voltage, the photocurrent
decreases despite an increasing drain current. This effect is due
to both the increase of electrode-mediated nonradiative exciton recombination
and the extraction of electrons at the drain electrode. However, as
expected, the maximum value of the EL external quantum efficiency
(EQE), i.e., the number of emitted
photons per transported electron, is observed for the case where the
recombination zone lies in the center of the channel (Figure 1F and D). The absolute value
of the EQE (up to 1.3 × 10–5) increases with
the applied drain voltage, presumably due to the filling of trap states
in the channel.24,51

The shape of the EL spectrum
of the fabricated QDLEFETs varies
slightly from sample to sample and in most cases can be fitted with
a single Gaussian peak. The fitted peak photon energy reaches a minimum
of 837 meV for low or negative gate voltages (Figure 1F), but upon increasing VGS, the EL maximum shifts by 14 meV to 851 meV, while
being hardly affected by the VDS. This
trend nicely follows the behavior of the drain current, as shown in Figure 1E, and we therefore
ascribe it to state filling due to a higher carrier concentration
in the channel.

Besides the high electroluminescence quantum
efficiency, for being
a viable technology, QDLEFETs have to enable electrical switching
like conventional FETs. The switching properties of our devices are
characterized by the output and transfer curve reported in Figure 2A and B, respectively.
The dashed lines in the figure are the backward scans, which for negative
gate voltages are substantially different from the forward scan (continuous
line), indicating a large hysteresis, as often reported for QD FETs.4,36,52−54 The negligible
hysteresis for electron accumulation (right plot) opposite the marked
effect in the hole channel (left plot) indicates the presence of hole-trapping
states within the band gap of the CQDs, while electron-trapping states
are shallow and cannot be distinguished from the transport states.
It should be noted that this nonsymmetric hysteresis in QD FETs has
been reported previously by our group and other researchers.5,27,31,54 The commonly accepted explanation of the hysteresis is the presence
of charge traps, which can be induced by the fabrication process,
can be located at the dielectric/semiconductor interface, or can be
within the semiconducting active layer.30,55 In our case,
the samples are fabricated in inert atmosphere to avoid contact with
environmental molecules known to be effective electron traps (vide infra); also the dielectric layer, in this case composed
of PMMA and Al2O3, has a less harmful effect
(lower interfacial trap density) than oxides such as the most common
SiO2. Additionally, the top gate structure serves as an
encapsulating layer, ensuring high air stability of the devices. We
therefore assume that the traps here predominantly originate from
the active material. The nature of such trap states in CQDs was discussed
in several reports, and the suggestions include a nonideal surface
stoichiometry, uncoordinated dangling bonds, or adsorbates.34,33,56,57

Figure 2 Output
(A) and transfer (B) curves of a QDLEFET. The hysteresis
is reported for the curves with the forward and the backward scan
illustrated by continuous and dashed curves, respectively. The output
curves (A) for the hole channel are plotted in the left and for the
electron channel in the right plot. The transfer curves (B) are plotted
in exponential (left axis, blue curve) and linear (right axis, orange
curve) scale for hole channel (left plot) and electron channel (right
plot).

The extracted linear electron
mobility has a value of 0.06 cm2 V–1 s–1 and exhibits
a correlation with the gate voltage, in good agreement with the hopping
electron transport model through an exponential tail of the density
of states.38 The large hysteresis of the
transfer curves for the hole channel, on the other hand, obscures
the hole transport properties and prevents the extraction of meaningful
values of the hole mobility. In n-channel operation, the QDLEFET shows
an on–off ratio greater than 104, and the switching
properties of the transistor could be further improved by inserting
hole-blocking contacts, for example. However, it is important to underline
that the transport performance of these transistors are close to state-of-the-art
PbS CQDs devices, reported recently by one of our groups.5

To acquire deeper insights into the charge
transport and a better
understanding of the reasons for the relatively low EL EQE values,
we furthermore studied the device properties at low temperatures.

The temperature dependence of the transfer curves of the QDLEFET,
measured in saturation mode, and the corresponding EL EQE values are
shown in Figure 3A
and B, respectively. The electron current exhibits a monotonic increase
with temperature from 20 K up to RT, which is in good agreement with
phonon-assisted hopping charge transport models. The hole current,
instead, displays a more complex behavior. It increases analogously
to the electron current up to 80 K, reaches a peak at 140 K, and decreases
up to 220 K, after which the value remains almost constant up to RT.
This behavior can be explained by the competition between thermally
activated phonon-assisted hopping transport through the transport
states and the charge-trapping process into deeper energy levels,
which are also thermally activated. While the first of the processes
increases the hole mobility, the second, on contrary, impedes the
hole transport.37 Dissimilarly to the current,
the EL EQE values decrease monotonically with increasing temperature
(Figure 3B).

dependence of the drain current (A) and of the EL EQE
(B) versus the gate voltage. Measurements
were taken for VDS = 18 V. The overall
drain current decreases at lower temperatures, while the EL EQE increases
by 4 orders of magnitude.

To investigate the charge transport mechanism in QDLEFETs,
we performed
low-temperature conductivity measurements of the electron and hole
channel in the linear regime.37 The results
are depicted in Figure 4A. The conductivity of the electron channel can be fitted very well
using the 2D Mott-type variable range hopping model (2D Mott-VRH).58 According to the model, the conductivity σ
is defined by the formula  where σ0 is the conductivity
parameter and TMott is the characteristic
temperature. It is worth mentioning at this point that the general
form of Mott-VRH transport includes an exponent ν = 1/(1 + d),
with d being the dimensionality of the system (in
this case d = 2 and ν = 1/3).

Figure 4 (A) Temperature dependence
of electron and hole conductivity in
the linear regime (blue and orange lines) plotted versusT–1/3 according to the 2D Mott
variable range hopping model. The values, extracted from forward and
from reverse hysteresis branches, are shown in open squares and in
filled circles, respectively. (B) Electroluminescence quantum efficiency
and relative quantum yield for photoluminescence versus temperature. The PL curve is fitted using nearest-neighbor hopping
(NNH) at high temperatures and 3D Mott-type variable range hopping
(3D-Mott VRH) at low temperatures.

The straight line fitted to the electron conductivity in Figure 4A has a slope TMott1/3 = 116 K1/3, from which the differential temperature-dependent
activation energy can be estimated using .59 This
yields
εa = 148 meV at RT, 98 meV at an intermediate temperature
of 160 K, and 25 meV at a low temperature of 20 K. Hopping conductance
involves those energy levels located close to the Fermi level in the
material, and this range decreases with the temperature, resulting
in a decrease of the number of states available for hopping. This
is the reason behind temperature dependence of the activation energy,
what is not the case in nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH) transport.
In contrast to the reported data on ordered superlattices of CQDs,
we did not observe switching from nearest-neighbor to variable-range
hopping, which could be explained by a larger degree of energetic
disorder in our CQD films.38

The
hole conductivity, measured in the linear regime, is plotted
along with the electron conductivity in Figure 4A. The values were taken for both the forward
and reverse scanning direction and display a pronounced hysteresis.
The hysteresis increases for temperatures higher than 80 K, reaching
a maximum between 160 and 200 K, and decreases slightly up to RT.
As mentioned above, this effect hinders the determination of the true
conductivity and prevents fitting the data using transport theories.
We assume that the hole transport can be described by the competition
of carrier hopping through transport states and trapping into deeper
levels within the fundamental band gap. At low temperatures (below
80 K), these trap states are filled, and only a negligible hysteresis
is observed. At intermediate temperatures (between 80 and 160 K),
thermal detrapping of carriers sets in and the voltage sweep leads
to a filling/emptying of the trap states, thus the hysteresis. Furthermore,
at high temperatures (exceeding 160 K) the holes acquire enough thermal
energy to enter and leave the trap states in the band gap, and the
hole conductivity increases with temperature, as is predicted by the
hopping model.

Inversely to the conductivity, as shown in Figure 4B, the overall EL
EQE increases drastically—by
more than 4 orders of magnitude at low temperature—and exceeds
1% below 100 K. Below 220 K, the emission is strong enough to be detected
over the whole gate voltage range. At lower temperature (20 K), the
emission from the central part of the channel was not detectable anymore
due to the low current. As a side note, we have to state that the
device chosen for low-temperature measurements was annealed less (120
°C, 30 min) than the one presented in Figure 1. In this way, we could avoid an excessive
red-shift of the EL that, in this specific case, was peaked at 0.88
eV at RT. As a consequence, this sample had a reduced maximum RT EL
EQE (2.5 × 10–6) compared to 1.3 × 10–5 for the samples, which were annealed at higher temperature
and longer (130 °C, 1 h).

Figure 4B shows
the temperature dependence of the maximum EQE of the EL and the relative
PL quantum yield (the latter given by the ratio of collected photons
per incident photons). The EL EQE can be defined as  where γ is
the ratio of the exciton
formation events with respect to the number of charge carriers injected
into the channel, ηPL is the photoluminescence quantum
efficiency, χ is the spin multiplicity of the radiatively recombining
excitons, and σout is the light out-coupling efficiency
from the device into the open space.60

The temperature-dependent photoluminescence quantum efficiency
ηPL has previously been used to gain insight into
the charge carrier transport in CQD thin films. Gao etal. considered the probability of radiative recombination
to be in competition with nonradiative recombination and phonon-assisted
exciton dissociation; following their discussion, the PL EQE can be
defined as42  where η′PL is the
efficiency of exciton recombination at 0 K, when the exciton dissociation
process is frozen, kr is the radiative
decay rate, and kdiss(T) is the exciton dissociation rate constant of the general form  (consider Figure 5A for a scheme). Under the assumption that
both kr and knr are temperature independent, they found that no single value of
ν can adequately describe the data across the entire temperature
region and fitted the data with ν = 1 at high temperature (NNH),
with the transition to ν = 0.5 (Efros–Shklovskii variable
range hopping, ES VRH) at low temperature. It should be noted that
fitting temperature-dependent PL data, as shown in Figure 4B, does not allow for firmly
distinguishing between various values of ν and, accordingly,
to make a conclusion about the hopping mechanism. Similarly to Gao’s
work, we were unable to find a single value ν and we fitted
the PL EQE data using the NNH model with the transition to VRH at
low temperatures. NNH yields an activation energy εa = 31 meV with the crossover temperature Tc = 160 K. For the low-temperature part, we based our choice of ν
on the conductivity studies and used the Mott-VRH model (but in three
dimensions, since excitons in the PL studies are free to move in the
entire film), i.e., with ν
= 0.25. We find a fitting parameter . Similarly to
the conductivity, the differential
activation energy was estimated using the expression εa = (k/4)T01/4T3/4, giving
60 meV at the crossover temperature (160 K) and 9 meV at low temperature
(20 K). These values are considerably lower than the activation energy
for the electron transport in a 2D layer, extracted from the conductivity
measurements (148 meV for RT, 98 meV for 160 K, and 25 meV for 20
K).

of the device at high (180 K) and low temperature (80 K). (C) Electroluminescence
peak energy versus gate voltage for the two temperatures
as in panel B and (D) EL EQE of QDLEFET for the temperatures as in
panel B.

Based on the discussion above,
the temperature dependence of the
EL EQE is proportional to  

For temperatures higher than
100 K the highest measured EL EQE
drastically decreases from 1% down to 0.001%, showing a sharp temperature
dependence as well as the PL EQE. The EL EQE temperature dependence
is defined by the exciton dissociation, which are neutral species
and are not affected by the electric field; therefore, we expect it
to be governed as the PL by NNH and 3D VRH rather than 2D Mott-VRH,
as found for the conductivity. However, as mentioned for the PL EQE
and shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1), fitting our set of data does not allow making a firm conclusion
about the type of hopping based on the exponent. Additionally, these
hopping theories do not take the presence of hole trapping energy
levels into account, the presence of which was evident from the conductivity
studies.

Figure 5 illustrates
the mechanism of carrier conduction, exciton dissociation, and electroluminescence
generation in QDLEFETs. In the schematics in Figure 5A, the transport energy levels of the CQDs
film are represented by black lines, showing the energetic disorder
determined by the assembly of the individual dots, and hole-trapping
states are shown by violet lines. Excitons, which are indicated here
with the green ellipse, are formed after charge capture and can undergo
radiative/nonradiative recombination or dissociation (indicated with
arrows and letters).

It is important to note that in the spectral
range investigated
we do not observe optical transitions from/to trap states; the main
significant influence of the charge trapping is the decrease of the
hole mobility and the appearance of the hysteresis.

The influence
of the hole trapping on the transfer curves of the
QDLEFET at two characteristic temperatures is illustrated in Figure 5B. For low temperature
(80 K), the curve has a symmetrical “V”-shape, representing
similar charge transport through transport levels for electrons and
holes. As stated above, these traps are thus inactive (filled) at
low temperature. However, for higher temperatures (180 K) the detrapping
process is activated and the shape of the transfer curve becomes asymmetrical.

Figure 5C shows
the dependence of the energy of the electroluminescence peak versus the applied gate voltage. The gate voltage effectively
shifts the Fermi level in the QDLEFET, moving it deeper into charge
transport levels, therefore including more states for electron or
hole transport. This leads to a band filling and a blue shift of the
emission for larger applied voltages at low temperature (15 and 8
meV for electron and hole accumulation, respectively). However, for
high temperatures, the emission blue-shifts much more noticeably for
the electron channel than for the hole channel. In the former case,
the shift amounts to 38 meV, but does not exceed 2 meV in the latter.
Given the activation of the trap states at elevated temperatures,
we expect the Fermi level to be pinned to the hole trap level at a
negative bias, which effectively prevents shifting it deeper into
the hole transport states. Therefore, the emission does not further
blue-shift, but the energy is limited by the energetic position of
the trap states. We furthermore note that the peak energy of the minimum
emission energy is reduced by 19 meV at low temperature, which is
predominantly the result of the band gap decrease of PbS CQDs at low
temperature.44,61

As discussed above, the
phonon-assisted exciton dissociation leads
to the inverse dependence of the EL EQE on the temperature: it decreases
from 0.9% at 80 K to 0.026% at 180 K. However, the shape of the EL
EQE curve as a function of the gate voltage remains similar, with
a small shift of the peak toward larger gate bias for the low-temperature
case. The EL EQE decreases symmetrically for large positive/negative
gate voltage both at high and low temperature, indicating that when
the recombination zone is close to either of the electrodes, the influence
of the contacts is limiting the EL EQE rather than the charge-trapping
process.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we presented and characterized
the first fully solid
QDLEFET and showed how this device not only has interesting application
prospects modulating simultaneously optical and electrical signals
but can also be used to study the physical properties of CQD films.
The QDLEFET shows good switching properties as an n-type FET, with
hysteresis-free electron transport giving a mobility of 0.06 cm2 V–1 s–1. The hole transport
shows a lower mobility and a pronounced hysteresis, pointing to the
presence of hole traps in the CQDs. Measurements of the QDLEFET conductivity
are well fitted by a 2D Mott-VRH transport for electrons and show
a more complex behavior of the hole conductivity, influenced by thermal
activation of the hole-trapping energy states. By changing the gate
bias, the recombination zone can be shifted within the channel of
the transistor from source or drain electrode to the middle of the
channel, where the EL EQE is significantly increased. At RT, a maximal
EL EQE of 1.3 × 10–5 is obtained. The emission
peak energy depends on the gate voltage and can be shifted on the
order of 10 meV, an effect we ascribe to state filling of the transport
levels at higher carrier densities. The EL EQE increases drastically
at low temperatures, reaching 1% below 100 K. This behavior is explained
by phonon-assisted dissociation of excitons.

Materials
and Methods
PbS CQDs Synthesis
Lead(II) acetate trihydrate (≥99.99%,
Aldrich), bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (Aldrich), 1-octadecene (ODE,
90%, Aldrich), oleic acid (90%, Aldrich), ethanol (Fluka), hexane
(Aldrich), and tetrachloroethylene (99%, Aldrich) were used as received.
PbS CQDs capped with oleate ligands were synthesized as described
elsewhere with slight modifications.5 A
1.5 g amount of lead(II) acetate trihydrate was dissolved in a mixture
of 47.2 mL of ODE and 2.8 mL of oleic acid. This solution was dried
for 1 h under vacuum at 120 °C in a three-neck flask using a
Schlenk line. Further reaction was carried out under an argon atmosphere.
The lead precursor solution was cooled to 85 °C, the heating
mantle was removed, and a solution of 0.420 mL of bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide
in 10 mL of dried ODE was quickly injected. Two minutes later the
reaction was quenched using a cold water bath. CQDs were purified
three times by washing with a hexane/ethanol mixture. Finally, PbS
CQDs were redispersed in anhydrous hexane, filtered through a 450
μm PTFE filter, and stored under an inert atmosphere. Solution
concentrations were determined by the measurement of the absorption
of diluted solutions at 400 nm.

Device Fabrication
A borosilicate glass plate (0.7
mm thick) was chosen as the substrate. After cleaning, the source
and drain electrodes (Ti/Au, 5/40 nm) were patterned using standard
lift-off lithography technique. After resist removal, the substrate
was annealed at 120 °C in a N2-filled glovebox. The
deposition of a CQD film took place in the glovebox, shortly after
annealing. The film was completed by spin-coating OA-capped PbS CQDs
(2 mg/mL for the first layer and 20 mg/mL for the next three layers
in hexane)4 and subsequent treatment of
the layers using TBAI (11 mg/mL in methanol) for ca. 35 s. After ligand exchange, the layers were washed twice with
pure methanol. After the completion of the CQD film, the substrate
was dried on a hot plate for 1 min at 120 °C. Then, an approximately
10 nm thick PMMA interlayer was spin-coated (10 mg/mL in toluene).
The substrate was transferred to the ALD chamber, and 600 cycles of
aluminum oxide were grown at 100 °C. Lastly, a 100 nm thick gold
gate electrode was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask.

Device
Characterization
Electrical characterization
of the QDLEFET was done using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter
analyzer. Electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectra were collected
using a spectrometer and recorded by an Andor iDus 1.7 μm InGaAs
camera. The electroluminescence EQE was calculated using a calibrated
photodiode, put in contact with the back side of the substrate. Using
these data, the camera was calibrated to estimate the EQE of the electroluminescence
and photoluminescence at low temperature. For low-temperature measurements,
the substrate was placed in a He-cooled cryostat with spring-loaded
contact pins for reliable electrical connection. Channel imaging was
done by a cooled 2D InGaAs camera (640 × 512 pixels NIRvana 640ST,
Princeton Instruments), using a 50× objective.
