Solid-state nanopore sensing of ultralong genomic DNA
molecules
has remained challenging, as the DNA must be controllably delivered
by its leading end for efficient entry into the nanopore. Herein,
we introduce a nanopore sensor device designed for electro-optical
detection and sorting of ultralong (300+ kilobase pair) genomic DNA.
The fluidic device, fabricated in-silicon and anodically bonded to
glass, uses pressure-induced flow and an embedded pillar array for
controllable DNA stretching and delivery. Extremely low concentrations
(50 fM) and sample volumes (∼1 μL) of DNA can be processed.
The low height profile of the device permits high numerical aperture,
high magnification imaging of DNA molecules, which remain in focus
over extended distances. We demonstrate selective DNA sorting based
on sequence-specific nick translation labeling and imaging at high
camera frame rates. Nanopores are fabricated directly in the assembled
device by laser etching. We show that uncoiling and stretching of
the ultralong DNA molecules permits efficient nanopore capture and
threading, which is simultaneously and synchronously imaged and electrically
measured. Furthermore, our technique provides key insights into the
translocation behavior of ultralong DNA and promotes the development
of all-in-one micro/nanofluidic platforms for nanopore sensing of
biomolecules.

==== Body
Analysis of long genomic DNA
(gDNA), i.e., >100 kilobase pair (kbp), can facilitate
mapping of large-scale genomic alterations, including transpositions,
inversions, segmental duplications and copy number variations,1,2 which is currently a challenge for DNA sequencing methods, particularly
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).3 The
manipulation and sensing of long individual gDNA molecules require
sophisticated means to uncoil and stretch individual DNA polymers
without shearing them while permitting sensing of the relevant information.
Another outstanding challenge is how to target or enrich specific
DNA fragments from the whole genome; single-molecule analysis methods
are inherently limited in their throughput, hence lowering the probability
of probing the fragments of interest. To date, methods such as DNA
combing4,5 and nanochannels6−8 have been developed
for this purpose, providing useful biomedical information and in some
cases disease relevant data, which is difficult to obtain using NGS.
While these methods are efficient at mapping large-scale genomic motifs
and producing genome-specific DNA barcodes,9,10 they
are subject to optical resolution limits. Consequently, the development
of complementary sensing modalities that can sort and uncoil long
DNA may expand the range of possible gDNA-based applications.

Nanopores have recently emerged as a powerful single-molecule sensing
method and consequently have been adapted for a broad range of biosensing
applications including purely electrical DNA sequencing, genotyping
and methylation quantification.11−13 In particular, solid-state nanopores
(ssNPs), considered to have superior properties in terms of manufacturability
and electro-mechanical robustness over protein pores,11 have been shown to be efficient as genotyping tools as
well as for mapping the interactions of bound proteins such as transcription
factors or other proteins such as RecA to DNA.14,15 Nevertheless, to date ssNP sensing has involved substantial off-chip
biochemical preparations, and in some cases amplification of the target
DNA sequence. Furthermore, absent a motor enzyme,16 ssNP sensing of ultralong unamplified gDNA has remained
challenging, as the DNA must be controllably delivered and uncoiled
immediately before it is fed to the nanopore. Failing to bring the
DNA’s end to the proximity of the pore may result in loss of
the molecule, irreversible clogging, and an extremely low capture
rate probability.17−20

In addition to the need to develop sophisticated means for
manipulation
of ultralong DNA, the rise of point-of-care diagnostics has significantly
fueled the development of nanopore sensors with additional on-chip
functionality, specifically for whole genome processing. To that end,
nanopore sensors have been integrated with microchannels21,22 or microvalves for fluid handling,23 as
well as containment chambers for reactions and purification.24 Besides methods for bulk handling of DNA, researchers
have investigated the controlled delivery of single DNA molecules
to the nanopore. For example, Zhang et al. embedded
a nanopore within a nanochannel and captured a fluorescently labeled
λ DNA molecule, albeit, without any electrical sensing.25 More recently, a two-pore device was assembled
for trapping a single DNA molecule in a “tug of war”
between the pores.26,27 Nonetheless, most practical applications
of the sensor have treated DNA preparation and sensing as separate
steps, relying on purified and amplified DNA samples up to just a
few tens of kilobase pairs in length.

Nanopore biosensing requires
low-noise and high-bandwidth electrical
measurement of ion flow through a unitary pore having comparable dimensions
to the molecule’s cross-section. This has been achieved by
the fabrication of an ultrathin, freestanding, insulating membrane
such as Si-rich silicon nitride, in which typically sub-20 nm nanopores
are formed. However, the integration of such sensors with a virtually
planar fluidic device compatible with high magnification and high-resolution
single-molecule fluorescent imaging has remained cumbersome due to
the strict requirements imposed by high numerical aperture optics
(short working distance) and low capacitance noise (high bandwidth
electronics). Herein, we present a monolithic nanopore sensor device
that uses an interfaced pillar array and controllable pressure-induced
flow for single-molecule delivery. Our device can uncoil gDNA fragments
over 400 kbp in length, which are extracted from human cancer cells
and fluorescently labeled, feeding them one by one into the integrated
nanopore for analysis. Instead of relying on soft-lithography microfluidics
(i.e., polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS, casting), we implemented
a complete in-silicon design permanently fused to glass for high-resolution
feature formation, enabling high magnification (100x objective) multicolor
single-molecule fluorescence imaging. We show that DNA molecules can
be sorted prior to the stretching stage based on sequence-specific
fluorescent tags, permitting precise targeting of the desired DNA
for efficient sampling. Optical sorting prior to nanopore analysis
sharply decreases the effective target DNA concentration down to a
few tens of femtomolar (10–15 M). Furthermore, the
chip design enables high magnification imaging of single translocation
events synchronized to the electrical signal, providing insights on
nanopore translocation behavior.

Results and Discussion
Design and Fabrication
The design features a central
silicon nitride pillar array, as is commonly used for stretching ultralong
DNA molecules,28,29 and a narrow channel (∼2.5
μm wide and 200 nm deep) for funneling linearized molecules
to the nanopore. The entire device is sealed by thin (150 ± 8
μm) borosilicate glass to enable high resolution (100×,
NA = 1.45) observation of single molecules during sorting, stretching,
and in the proximity of the nanopore. The shallow depth of the narrow
channel also ensures that DNA molecules always fall within the nanopore
capture radius. Microchannels in an easy-to-flush U-shape are connected
by through-holes etched through the silicon substrate to four liquid
reservoirs made in a thick PDMS slab bonded to the silicon substrate
on the back side (Figure 1a). A single port on each side of the chip accepts plastic
tubing for applying negative pressure. The final port on the entry
side can be loaded with sample to be pulled into the microchannel
by pressure flow. The U-shaped microchannels are bridged by a narrower
channel containing the pillar array, leading to a finer passage that
is situated atop a free-standing silicon nitride (SiNx) membrane in which a single nanopore is fabricated
(Figure 1b–d).
A fifth reservoir connects to the trans side of the
membrane and accepts an AgCl electrode for applying positive bias
referenced to a cis electrode on the outlet side
of the pillars. While the microchannels on both sides are the same
depth (∼650 nm), the entry-side channel is half the size of
the outlet-side channel in order to restrict all passing molecules
to within the field of view of the camera. The outlet-side channel,
100 μm in width, is made larger to minimize the ohmic resistance
between the cis and trans electrodes
and thus maximize the nanopore signal.

Device Sealing by Anodic Bonding
While the literature
on glass bonding to silicon and silicon dioxide (SiO2)
is extensive, there are fewer examples of glass bonding to SiNx. Moreover, given the fragility of the thin
free-standing membrane, our initial attempts to bond glass to SiNx used thin spun-on coatings such as sodium
silicate30 and polysilsesquioxane,31 which would not expose the chip to high temperatures
or stresses for prolonged periods. However, these coatings rely on
condensation reactions between the silanol groups of the glass and
the substrate, and SiNx has a low density
of silanols. Hence, we failed to achieve uniform and reproducible
bonding over the surface of the chip. As an alternative, we tried
a low temperature anodic bonding method developed specifically for
SiNx,32 which
was shown to form strong bonds in as little as 15 min, significantly
faster than low temperature annealing on its own.33 For anodic bonding to work, it was necessary to form a
thin SiO2/SixOyNz layer on the SiNx surface by subjecting it to oxygen plasma.
Importantly, the plasma power was kept low (25 W) to minimize surface
roughening which can inhibit the bonding process, as described by
Weichel et al.(32) Anodic
bonding optimization was carried out between 400 and 1000 V on a 350–400
°C hot plate for 10–90 min with borosilicate glass (Borofloat
33), which has a matching thermal expansion coefficient to SiNx.

At these bonding conditions, it was
necessary to preserve the 500 nm thick SiO2 layer as structural
support for the SiNx membrane to prevent
membrane deflection and bonding to the glass. This behavior was also
observed with the oxide layer in place when the aspect ratio of the
channel exceeded roughly 15 (depth = 200 nm, width = 3 μm).
Membrane collapse was observable as a contrasted area in a white light
microscope or by imaging Alexa Fluor 488 in the channel, as shown
in Figure S2 for various designs. In accordance
with an expected V2tend likelihood of contact,34 where V is the applied voltage and tend is the total bond time, we found that bonding could be accelerated
by applying a high voltage (1000 V) for a short period of time (14
min). Minimizing the quotient V2tend was critical to prevent excessive membrane
strain and cracking, which showed up as a leakage through the membrane
after oxide removal.

Nanopore Fabrication by Laser-Etching
Given the high
temperature and stresses induced by anodic bonding, it was crucial
to find a nanopore fabrication method that could be done in
situ, after the device was sealed by glass. While dielectric
breakdown only requires electrolytic contact of the two surfaces of
the membrane and could thus be used to form a pore in a sealed device,35,36 nanopore formation is not easily localized.37,38 To control the nanopore position requires selective thinning of
the membrane by an upstream lithographic and RIE process, which is
challenging to align in a ∼2.5 μm channel. Hence, we
opted for a recently developed nanopore fabrication technique based
on laser-etching, which offers diffraction-limited (∼200 nm)
control of the nanopore position.39,40 These studies
showed that the laser-drilling process is highly sensitive to the
material Si content, buffer pH, and laser wavelength. Taking advantage
of these findings, we used a near-ultraviolet laser (375 nm, 10–15
mW) to form a nanopore precisely located at the center of the narrow
channel. Parts a and c of Figure 2 show the channel area and the SiNx free-standing membrane before and after laser irradiation,
respectively (reflected white light illumination), and during laser
drilling (Figure 2b).
A darker (thinner) spot is clearly observed following laser illumination. Figure 2d and Figure S4 present example current traces for
the etching process leading to nanopore formation, signaled by a rise
in current above the baseline value. Etching occurred in 1 M KCl pH
10, and nanopores were typically formed within 50 s based on over
40 trials (see Table S1 for a summary of
tested devices). Subsequently, the nanopore was allowed to stabilize
over a few minutes, and the I–V response was measured, as shown in Figure 2e. Based on the pore conductance obtained
from the slope, and taking into consideration the channel resistance
(6.0 ± 0.2 MΩ), we estimated this particular pore to be
4.5 ± 0.5 nm in diameter for an effective thickness range of
4–6 nm as predicted by Gilboa et al.39 Nanopores can be subsequently expanded by laser or by applying moderate
voltage pulses (1–5 V).

measurement in 1 M KCl following pore stabilization (conductivity,

Selective Uncoiling and Stretching of Long gDNA
To
date, DNA translocation measurements through solid-state nanopores
have been limited to short or medium length DNA, typically up to ∼48.5
or 97 kbp (i.e., λ phage genome monomer or
dimers).41,42 Moreover, most nanopore studies use either
synthetic DNA (i.e., PCR replica of the target DNA)
or plasmids amplified in host bacteria. Consequently, little is known
about the propensity of much longer DNA (i.e., >
100 kbp) to enter pores. In particular, the rate at which DNA (as
well as other charged molecules) are captured by the pore is governed
by the size of the capture radius around the pore in which molecules
are electrically attracted. In bulk solution, double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) forms Gaussian coils, which are well approximated by a wormlike
chain model for which the root mean-square end-to-end distance is , where P is the persistence
length (about 50 nm) and L0 is the contour
length. In the case of ultralong DNA, the coil size may exceed the
capture radius of the nanopore, hence raising a question about its
capture rate and capture probability.42 The problem is compounded by the potential for DNA clogging, which
may occur depending on the molecule’s initial configuration.
Uncoiling and stretching the dsDNA and physically bringing one of
the DNA ends to the pore vicinity may therefore be a prerequisite
to efficient DNA capture and avoiding irreversible clogging.

We first quantified the extent by which the device can stretch and
disentangle ultralong DNA. While short (i.e., tens
of kbp) strands are commonly isolated from cells with the aid of centrifugation,
extraction and preservation of ultralong gDNA fragment requires a
more delicate procedure: To prevent DNA fragmentation, human cancer
cells were encapsulated in agar plugs for controlled cell lysis and
DNA release (see the Supporting Information). The agar was subsequently enzymatically digested, and the DNA
molecules were stained for high-resolution imaging using the intercalator
dye YOYO-1 (see the Materials and Methods)
which is known to induce molecule extension of around 5% for our staining
ratio of 1:20 (bp:dye) and assuming a linear dependence on YOYO-1
concentration.43 The DNA molecules were
first loaded by applying a negative pressure of ∼990 mbar across
the ∼650 μm in depth microchannel, resulting in partial
elongation due to the constriction of the microchannel and the pressure-induced
flow. The molecules were subsequently imaged at high-speed (∼30
FPS) and high magnification (60× or 100× objectives) as
they were forced through the nanopillar array.

The transition
from the deep microchannels to the pillar region
(∼200 nm deep) presents an entropic barrier to DNA coil migration
and results in substantial elongation of the molecule, as observable
in Figure 3a (see also Supporting Movie S1). The DNA strands are further
disentangled and elongated at the pillar array, which acts as a molecular
sieve, due to the increased fluid velocity (due to lower area) and
hooking/unhooking to the pillars.44 Rather
than achieving complete DNA linearization, our goal was to sufficiently
uncoil the DNA in order to expose one of its ends to the pore proximity;
hence, the pillar design was loosely derived from literature examples6,29 as well as experimentation with designs of different pitch and pillar
diameter. Generally, we found that smaller pillars (e.g., 2 μm compared to 4 μm) and a smaller pitch (e.g., 2 μm compared to 3 μm) were more effective
at hooking DNA, resulting in uncoiling and semilinearization of strands
beyond the camera field of view (136 μm). Additional examples
of DNA stretching, particularly highlighting hooking/unhooking to
the pillars, are given in Figure S6.

Figure 3 Ultralong genomic
DNA uncoiling and stretching in a pillar array.
(a) YOYO-1 labeled DNA (20:1 bp:dye) in TE buffer is pulled by 8–10
mbar vacuum from the ∼650 nm deep microchannel through the
200 nm deep pillar array over 4.5 s. (b) End-to-end distance of the
DNA strand relative to its starting end-to-end distance in the microchannel
as a function of time. The end-to-end distance increases about 6-fold
for this molecule for a contour length of ∼140 μm or
at least 390 kbp (adjusted for YOYO-1 extension by 5%). (c) End-to-end
distance of the DNA strand increases linearly with the position in
the pillar array.

We estimated the end-to-end distance of a partially
stretched representative
DNA molecules as a function of time and position, before and after
entering the pillar array (Figure 3b,c). Upon entering the pillar array, the dsDNA sharply
stretches, which appears to be roughly linear with the extent to which
the DNA traverses the pillars and reaches at least 6-fold (Figure 3c) along a 120 μm
travel distance. Importantly. This stretching “exposes”
a DNA end, positioning it in the proximity of the nanopore’s
capture radius, which has been optimized to extend 15–30 μm
laterally toward the pillars, as discussed in a later section.

DNA Sorting
Genomic DNA samples as well as other biological
DNA samples from clinical sources contain a wide range of DNA fragment
lengths and types. In many practical cases, the target DNA will constitute
only a small fraction of the total DNA, hence presenting a challenge
for nanopore sensing and analysis. In particular, when processing
thousands of long DNA molecules, nanopores may clog before sufficient
sampling of the target DNA. Preselection strategies used to enrich
the desired DNA population may therefore be essential for successful
sensing. Unlike conventional nanopore sensors where samples are sensed
indiscriminately, our microfluidic platform enables selective sampling,
in addition to rapid buffer and sample exchange. As such, DNA molecules
that are entangled with one another or too short can be forced to
bypass the pore. Alternatively, multicolor and sequence-specific DNA
labeling can be used for more efficient sensing. To demonstrate this
principle, DNA was prepared by nick translation using site-specific
nicking enzyme Nt.BspQI and by Taq polymerase incorporation of Atto-647N,
followed by YOYO-1-labeling of the backbone. The Nt.BspQI enzyme was
chosen due to its proven efficiency and sequence selectivity, but
it should be noted that other labeling methods could be employed targeting
different recognition sequences (e.g., CRISPR-CAS9
nickase labeling45) or epigenetic modifications
(e.g., 5-hmC labeling8). Incorporation of the Atto dye occurs on average every 10–15
kbp, as determined by image analysis of DNA molecules stretched on
glass (Figure 4a and Figure S3).

Figure 4 DNA sorting based on sequence-specific
fluorescent tags. (a) DNA
stretched on glass that has been nick-translated with site-specific
Nt.BspQI for Atto647N labeling in red and subsequently labeled with
a YOYO-1 backbone in blue. (b) Principal and implementation of two-color
fluorescence sorting. Molecules labeled in both red and blue are vacuumed
past the pillar array, whereas the blue-only molecules are stopped
at the pillar array for subsequent stretching and delivery to the
nanopore for sensing. (c) Delivery rate of YOYO-1 labeled 10 kbp dsDNA
to the pillar as a function of DNA concentration (measured in a single
device).

For DNA sorting, we developed a labeling scheme
whereby molecules
are either one or two color labeled: DNA molecules that are labeled
by nick translation (the Atto647N dyes) constitute the majority of
the sample and are allowed to flow past the nanopillar array. In contrast,
molecules not labeled by nick translation trigger opening of the electrically
actuated pressure valve, stopping them at the pillar entrance for
subsequent stretching and nanopore sensing (done manually). The silicon
dioxide microchannels have low photoluminescence in the 400–750
nm range and, given their shallow depth (∼650 nm), passing
molecules are either in focus or slightly out of focus but still distinguishable
as either one or two color labeled. Hence, selection can be made upstream
of nanopore sensing in the faster moving microchannel (600–700
μm/s), which is useful when the molecule of interest is rare,
requiring sifting through hundreds or even thousands of molecules
during which the nanopore can irreversibly clog. In Figure 4b, we focus on two typical
DNA molecules out of thousands not shown. The molecules are imaged
using an EMCCD at high speed (∼30 FPS) for fast software-based
decision-making. This trigger mechanism is also employed (along with
manual control) for stopping DNA at the pillar exit, as shown in Supporting Movie S2.

To evaluate the sampling
efficiency, we quantified the molecule
delivery rate to the pillars as a function of concentration. For this
we used shorter YOYO-1-labeled DNA strands of a uniform length (10
kbp) that would not shear and hence whose concentration can be determined
accurately in bulk using a UV–vis spectrometer. As depicted
in Figure 4c, in the
range of nearly 3 decades in concentration from 50 fM to 10 pM, the
molecule delivery rate to the pillars varies from ∼0.65 to
120 s–1. In Figure 4c (inset) we show that the dependence of the capture
rate on concentration is linear, as expected, implying that the yield
remains constant across this concentration range. Notably, extremely
low concentrations of starting material can be used with high capture
rate to the nanopillar array region. Similarly, the sample loading
volume is comparatively small (∼1 μL fills the PDMS loading
port), making our device highly compatible with clinical DNA samples.

Nanopore Capture and Translocations
While the YOYO-1-labeling
strategy employed here served for a convenient proof of principle,
which could in theory be substituted by covalent labeling, it was
necessary to load the DNA at low salt (<100 mM) to prevent rapid
YOYO-1 unbinding.46 However, the cis electrode, placed at the pillar exit, could be filled
with higher salt concentrations. As the electrode is placed on the
opposite side of DNA movement, the electric field lines around the
pore are somewhat biased away from the DNA; however, by applying a
salt gradient across the nanopore, as implemented in a conventional
nanopore sensor,42 we were able to extend
the capture radius significantly. In particular, we used a 1:10 salt
gradient (0.1:1 M KCl cis/trans.
The effect is that the DNA is immediately pulled toward the pore after
being delivered within 20–30 μm and the vacuum is shut
off. Since the device depth at this stage is only ∼200 nm,
the molecule’s position with respect to the membrane surface
has negligible impact on capture. To ensure sufficient nanopore signal
strength, we used high voltages (500–1000 mV), and typically
nanopores up to 20 nm exhibited a detectable signal. The nanopore
noise was between 50 and 70 pA RMS at 10 kHz with the blue widefield
laser off and 100–200 pA with the laser on at ∼5 W/cm2 (see Figure S5 for the noise spectrum).

We first examined the translocation of ultralong DNA through larger
(i.e., 15+ nm) pores suitable for the detection of
transcription factors, DNA binding proteins, or other bound targets.
To accurately determine the point at which the DNA engages and exits
the nanopore, we performed these and other translocation experiments
at 100×. Figure 5 and Supporting Movie S3 present an example
translocation event in a 20 nm pore, in which a minimum 400 kbp strand
is translocated (i.e., the event is so long that
we have given a conservative estimate based on the 100× image
and translocation duration). At 24.07 s, the vacuum is turned off,
and the DNA is immediately electrophoretically pulled to the pore,
making contact at 27.22 s. The DNA is subsequently pulled through
over the next 2.96 s, and by frame 30.18, the DNA is still translocating.
A visible fluorescent spot remains over the next 2–3 s. As
the lagging strand will be pulled to the pore independent of whether
the leading strand has translocated, it appears the DNA accumulated
somewhat at the pore mouth, and by 32.56 s, has mainly disappeared
to the other side of the pore. For this particularly long event and
large nanopore, we could only discern a distinct electrical signal
at the DNA entry into the pore (∼300 pA drop).

Figure 5 Translocation of ultralong
DNA. YOYO-1-labeled DNA is delivered
to the nanopore by vacuum and subsequently electrophoretically driven
through a ∼20 nm nanopore at a 1 V applied bias. The first
image (21.82 s) shows the DNA traversing the pillar array, already
uncoiled. At 24.07 s, the vacuum is shut off, at which point the DNA
is pulled to the nanopore (indicated by a yellow circle), making contact
at 27.22 s. It then translocates for the next several seconds, and
by 30.18 s, the lagging strand of the DNA becomes visible. By 32.56
s, the DNA has mainly disappeared to the other side of the membrane,
and the nanopore is ready to accept a new molecule (37.49 s).

In Figure S7 we analyzed
the DNA molecule
speed before, during, and at the end of translocation. During the
capture phase, the DNA accelerates from rest to about 19 μm/s,
at which point it contacts the nanopore and accelerates. At around
28.9 s, the appearance of a distinct ∼4 μm (∼15
kbp) segment with low YOYO-1 labeling density provides us a means
of directly measuring the translocation speed, for which we obtain
∼130 μm/s, roughly constant over 8 frames. It is well-established
that partially denatured AT-rich regions present as dark patches in
YOYO-1 denaturation mapping assays, and hence, the observed dark segment
is likely an AT-rich region with a low melting point (at our given
salt concentration).47,48 Nearing the end of the translocation,
the DNA speed through the pore increases 3-fold (390 μm/s) and
reaches at least 800 μm/s for the remaining ∼26 μm
of threading. The optical translocation profile suggests that early
in the threading process, there is a large drag force on the ultralong
molecule causing it to thread slowly compared to when the bulk of
the molecule has passed through the pore.

We also electrically
recorded translocations of long DNA molecules
in smaller pores (<15 nm). Figure 6 depicts such a sequence in which the nanopore current
and EMCCD video are simultaneously and synchronously recorded (see
also Supporting Movie S4): In the first
snapshot, the DNA molecule has uncoiled and stretched and is within
close enough proximity to the nanopore such that terminating the vacuum
(second snapshot) results in an electrophoretic migration toward the
pore, as in the larger pore described above. Around 1915.9 s, the
DNA end engages the nanopore (third snapshot), resulting in a sharp
downward transition in nanopore conductance (green vertical line).
The amplitude of the conductance drop is proportional to the surface
area of an unfolded dsDNA molecule in the nanopore (d = 12 nm). Following this transition, we literally observe the translocation
of the DNA through the nanopore, as the YOYO-1 rapidly dissociates
from the DNA in the higher salt trans chamber leaving
only a weak fluorescence spot at the nanopore location (yellow circle).
Around 1920.1 s the nanopore conductance restores to its open level,
again in an abrupt transition (2nd green line), at which point the
nanopore is ready to accept another DNA molecule.

Figure 6 Electro-optical translocation
of ultralong DNA. Top shows the electrical
recording through a 12 nm nanopore at a 1 V applied bias (gray trace,
10 kHz; black trace, 1 kHz) during which a ∼60 μm in
contour length YOYO-1-labeled double-stranded DNA is translocated.
The electrical event is aligned to a series of images (1–8)
taken at 100× using an EMCCD at 25 ms exposure, showing the YOYO-1-labeled
DNA before and during translocation. At frame 1, the vacuum has been
shutoff, resulting in an electrophoretic migration to the pore. The
DNA subsequently translocates and exits the nanopore over the subsequent
frames (2–8). The conductance drop associated with DNA threading
is indicated by the two green vertical lines.

Based on the stretched image of the DNA, we approximate
its contour
length as about 60 μm (assuming our device can achieve about
80% stretching of the molecule, as described in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the 4.2 s translocation
time corresponds to a rate of about 23 μs/bp. Notably, this
amounts to >3 orders of magnitude slowing down compared with previous
DNA translocation studies using comparable nanopores at 1 V bias.
The translocation time is significantly longer for larger pores as
well (i.e., 20 nm), as presented earlier, in which
the 300+ kbp strand takes over 3 s to fully clear the pore. The last
two frames (60 ms) show a clearance of about 100 kbp or ∼0.5
μs/bp based on the migration of the DNA lagging strand to the
pore. At a YOYO-1 staining ratio of 1:20 (bp:dye), the molecule’s
effective negative charge only reduces to 90%. Therefore, the slow
translocation is likely attributable to the orientation of DNA entry
with respect to the electric field lines or a larger drag force imparted
on the ultralong molecule.

Conclusions
In this work, we presented the fabrication
and implementation of
a fluidic device for controlled single-molecule delivery and nanopore
sensing of ultralong genomic DNA. As an in-silicon design anodically
fused to glass, the device is compatible with high-magnification (100×
high NA objective) multicolor fluorescent imaging. For nanopore fabrication,
we utilized a recently developed laser-etching technique, showing
its advantages over conventional methods (e.g., TEM,
dielectric breakdown) for in situ localized nanopore
formation. By using fast-moving pressure-induced flow, DNA concentrations
as low as 50 fM, as may be expressed in rare samples, can be readily
delivered to the nanopore for sensing. Further gains in sampling efficiency
are made possible by multicolor fluorescent labeling of the DNA molecules,
as we presented preliminarily. Next, we demonstrated the translocation
of ultralong DNA (>300 kbp) through 10–20 nm nanopores,
suitable
for electrical detection of bound protein targets such as RecA or
other DNA binding proteins. While this work focused on YOYO-1 labeling,
alternative fluorescence labeling strategies may be applied, such
as BrdU/EdU, as is common for investigating DNA replication. In particular,
the use of covalently attached fluorophores may permit DNA resensing,
which in combination with the observed slow translocation time (∼20–25
μs/bp), presents a possible avenue for DNA sequencing and will
be the subject of further study. In addition to the practical applications
discussed here, direct visualization of DNA translocation behavior
(e.g., failed entries, Figure S8) may complement our existing understanding of DNA translocation
dynamics,49 hitherto dependent primarily
on electrical data and theoretical modeling.

Materials and Methods
Chip Fabrication
Fabrication began by depositing 200
nm of low stress SiNx onto a starting
SiNx/SiO2/Si wafer (50 nm/350
nm/350 μm) by PECVD (300 °C) in order to increase the workable
channel depth. Following cleaning in solvents (acetone, methanol,
2-propanol, water), the wafer was baked on a hot plate at 300 °C
for 10 min. AZ1518 resist was spin-coated at 4000 rpm to a thickness
of ∼1.8 μm and baked on a hot plate at 120 °C for
2 min. The pillar structures were exposed by UV light (MicroWriter
ML3), developed in Novo Developer (2.14% TMAH in water), and subsequently
etched by reactive ion etching (RIE) with 10 sccm CF4 and
10 sccm O2 (75 W, 0.15 mbar). Microchannels were then front
side aligned to the pillars and etched by RIE through the entire SiNx thickness. The ∼10 × 10 μm2 free-standing membrane and 0.5 mm through-ports were exposed
as individual squares backside-aligned to the microchannels. Along
with cutlines, the SiNx and underlying
SiO2 insulating layer were etched by RIE and BOE, respectively,
and then opened by anisotropic etching in 33% KOH for individual 10
× 10 mm2 chips. Figure S1 presents the full overview.

Anodic Bonding Preparation
To prepare the SiNx surface for anodic bonding, it was first cleaned
of organic contaminants in hot piranha (120 °C) for 5 min, rinsed
several times in deionized water, and blown dry by nitrogen. It then
underwent oxygen plasma for 5 min (0.4 mbar, ∼135 sccm, 25
W) to form a thin SiO2/SixOyNz layer. Glass
slides (12 × 12 mm2) were laser-cut from a 100 mm
150 ± 8 μm borosilicate glass wafer (Borofloat 33, Plan
Optik). The glass was dipped in BOE for 15 s, cleaned in hot piranha
(120 °C) for 5 min, rinsed several times in deionized water,
and blown dry by nitrogen. The SiNx surface
was then brought into contact with the glass piece within a cleanroom
environment and bonded using a custom-built apparatus (400 °C,
1000 V, 14 min).

PDMS Bonding
PDMS (SYLGARD 184) was mixed in a 10:1
(base:curing agent) ratio by weight, degassed, and baked on a hot
plate at 80 °C for at least 5 h. Subsequently, 20 × 20 mm2 slabs were cut and access ports were punctured through. The
PDMS and SiNx surfaces were plasma-activated
in air (11 W, 515 mTorr, 50 s), brought into contact, and baked on
a hot plate for 5–10 min.

Genomic DNA Labeling and Purification
Genomic DNA samples
from human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116) were prepared in agarose
plugs according to the IrysPrep Plug Lysis Long DNA Isolation Protocol
(Bionano Genomics Inc.) with some modifications as described in the Supporting Information. Purified DNA was subsequently
labeled by nick translation using nicking enzyme Nt.BspQI (NEB). Briefly,
a 900 ng portion of DNA was incubated with 30 units of Nt.BspQI in
10× buffer 3.1 for 2 h. Next, 600 nM of dATP, dGTP, dCTP (Sigma),
and dUTP-Atto (Jena Bioscience), 15 units of Taq polymerase, and 4.5
μL of 10x thermopol buffer was added to the nicked DNA to a
final volume of 45 μL and incubated at 75 °C for 1 h. To
repair the nicked DNA, 12 units of Taq ligase (NEB), 1.5 μL
of 10x thermopol buffer (NEB), and 1 mM NAD+ was added to a final
volume of 60 μL. Finally, the DNA was purified from excess fluorophores
twice by drop dialysis using a 0.1 μm dialysis membrane (Millipore)
floated on TE (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8). A 0.5 μL volume
of DNA was subsequently dyed at a base pair to YOYO-1 ratio of 20–25:1
in TE to a total volume of 15 μL.

Setup and Device Operation
For imaging and laser-etching,
we constructed a custom-designed dual widefield/confocal microscope.
In widefield mode, a 488 or 641 nm laser (iFlex-2000) was expanded
to yield a ∼82 × 82 μm2 illuminated area
through a NA 1.45 100× oil objective (Olympus PlanApo). Alternatively,
a ∼136 × 136 μm2 area was obtained through
a NA 1.45 60× oil objective (Olympus PlanApo). In confocal mode,
a 375 nm laser (Coherent OBIS) was focused on the objective. Images
were acquired on an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon 887) at 25 ms exposure
and 1 × 1 binning to yield a 160 nm pixel size at 100x. Transmembrane
voltages were applied using an Axopatch 200B and samples were taken
at 250 kHz and filtered externally (Krohn-Hite 3202) at 10 kHz. The
EMCCD camera was synchronized to the Axopatch analog acquisition via firepulses. DNA was pulled into the sensing region by
applying vacuum (∼8–10 mbar), which could be turned
on and off rapidly by electrically actuated valves (Warner). All instrumentation
was controlled by custom LabVIEW software.

Loading Buffers
DNA samples were diluted in 10 mM Tris
HCl pH 8 to a final concentration of 0.1–1 ng/μL. The
outlet-side channel and cis chamber were filled with
100 mM KCl and 1 M KCl, respectively, with 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 and
1 mM EDTA.
