Charge-carrier
transport in oriented COF thin films is an important
factor for realizing COF-based optoelectronic devices. We describe
how highly oriented electron-donating benzodithiophene BDT-COF thin
films serve as a model system for a directed charge-transport study.
Oriented BDT-COF films were deposited on different electrodes with
excellent control over film roughness and topology, allowing for high-quality electrode–COF
interfaces suitable for device fabrication. Hole-only devices were
constructed to study the columnar hole mobility of the BDT-COF films.
The transport measurements reveal a clear dependency of the measured
hole mobilities on the BDT-COF film thickness, where thinner films
showed about two orders of magnitude higher mobilities than thicker
ones. Transport measurements under illumination yielded an order of
magnitude higher mobility than in the dark. In-plane electrical conductivity
values of up to 5 × 10–7 S cm–1 were obtained for the oriented films. Impedance measurements of
the hole-only devices provided further electrical description of the
oriented BDT-COF films in terms of capacitance, recombination resistance,
and dielectric constant. An exceptionally low dielectric constant
value of approximately 1.7 was estimated for the BDT-COF films, a
further indication of their highly porous nature. DFT and molecular-dynamics
simulations were carried out to gain further insights into the relationships
between the COF layer interactions, electronic structure, and the
potential device performance.

Organic semiconducting
compounds
are increasingly being developed as advanced materials for optoelectronic
applications. Because versatile synthetic design strategies enable
tunable mechanical and electronic material properties, organic semiconductors
have been successfully integrated into a wide range of electronic
devices.1,2 Many factors govern the performance of the
organic layers in a device, where packing and long-range order are
among the key features influencing the charge-carrier transport properties
and therefore the final device performance.3,4 In
this context, specific molecular alignments in a crystalline film
and control over the film morphology can cause a significant improvement
of the fundamental transport properties in organic electronics.2,5,6 Developing new platforms to control
the structure-transport properties relationship is therefore of paramount
importance.7

Layered alternating
copolymers consisting of discrete subunits
that self-assemble through dispersive forces allow for the formation
of highly ordered, porous structures, so-called two-dimensional covalent
organic frameworks (2D COFs).8−11 The slightly reversible nature of the covalent bond
formation reactions connecting the COF subunits in combination with
the mode of COF layer assembly enable, in principle, the formation
of ordered molecular columns. Hence, the incorporation of electroactive
subunits into a 2D COF backbone permits precise molecular positioning
in a periodic columnar manner.12−15 Therefore, charge migration in the columns of 2D
COFs relies mainly on the interactions between adjacent COF layers.
A detailed description of their transport properties is highly desirable
in order to identify 2D COFs suitable for organic electronics.15−17 In this context, depositing 2D COFs on semiconducting surfaces is
a first step toward COF-based device fabrication.18,19 Control over the orientation of the COF layers relative to the surface
permits the investigation of the charge migration behavior in the
plane and in the molecular columns of the COF. For these studies,
thin COF films with a preferential layer orientation parallel to the
surface are highly desirable.

Recently, we and others15,17−19 reported in a family of boronate ester electron-donating
thiophene-containing
COFs.18,20−22 Light-induced charge
separation and collection in a photovoltaic device was first demonstrated
with a thienothiophene-based COF, TT-COF.20 Charge transfer from an electron-donating COF backbone to an acceptor
phase was studied for oriented thin films of a benzodithiophene-based
COF, BDT-COF. Dinca et al. reported the synthesis
of BDT-COF analogues with heavy chalcogens and studied their electrical
conductivity in the bulk.23

In this
work, oriented BDT-COF thin films integrated into a device
serve as model systems for studying directional charge-carrier transport
and additional electrical properties. The hole mobility of the BDT-COF
along the columnar stacks was studied in a diode configuration by
constructing hole-only devices (HODs). We tested our premise that
this model system is a photoactive material by measuring columnar
hole mobilities under illumination and in the dark. In-plane conductivity
measurements of the BDT-COF along the COF layers provided a complementary
electrical description of the system. Impedance measurements yielded
additional electrical characteristics such as capacitance, recombination
resistance and dielectric constant of the COF. Furthermore, theoretical
investigations provide a link between the BDT-COF layer interactions
and the charge transport along the BDT molecular stacks.

Results and Discussion
Charge-carrier transport along the stacked columnar COF layers
is a factor of key importance in the overall performance of devices
based on oriented COF films. To identify potential COF candidates
for optoelectronic applications, a detailed characterization of the
physical and optoelectronic properties is highly desirable. Charge-carrier
mobility of photoactive materials can be obtained from the electrical
characteristics of a diode in which the photoactive material is sandwiched
between two electrodes (Scheme 1). In the case of oriented thin COF films, this architecture
allows for charge-carrier mobility directed exclusively along the
stacked layers to be examined. We therefore initiated our study with
the synthesis of oriented thin BDT-COF films on different glass-coated
indium-doped tin oxide electrodes (ITO). We followed our previously
reported in situ film growth via the solvothermal
co-condensation of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyldiboronic acid, BDTBA, and the polyol 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene,
HHTP (Scheme 1).24 Briefly, stoichiometric amounts of BDTBA and
HHTP monomers were placed in a stainless steel autoclave with an appropriate
amount of mesitylene/dioxane 1:1 v/v solvent mixture, which serves
as the reaction medium. Later, a Teflon holder equipped with the desired
conducting substrates was introduced into the autoclave. The autoclave
was sealed and placed in a preheated oven at 100 °C for 12 h.
At the end of the solvothermal reaction, the substrates were recovered,
washed with anhydrous acetone, and left overnight at 150 °C under
vacuum. Along with the conductive substrates, a green powder was collected
by vacuum filtration. The obtained powder was washed with anhydrous
acetone to afford a highly crystalline COF powder, which is a first
indication for the deposition of a crystalline film (Figure 1a).

A high-quality interface between
the COF film and both electrodes
is required to construct an efficient hole-only device. Top-view scanning
electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the resulting electrodes reveals
a smooth and homogeneous coverage (Figure S1a). Cross-section SEM images show a uniform dense thin film with a
thickness of approximately 200 nm (Figure 1b). The surface morphology and roughness
of the deposited films were additionally examined using atomic force
microscopy (AFM). The AFM scan reveals a surface comprising intergrown
domains forming a continuous, almost flawless film topography (Figure 1d,e). The average
roughness (Ra), extracted from the film topography, was determined
to be about 6 nm, corresponding to a relatively smooth surface suitable
for constructing a hole-only device. A detector scan X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis indicates the preferential parallel orientation of
the COF layers with respect to the electrode surface (Figure S1b). Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray
scattering analysis (GI-SAXS) confirmed that indeed preferential orientation
of the COF layers was obtained, with the [001]-axis (c-axis) oriented orthogonal to the surface and rotational freedom
around this axis, which is in agreement with our previous report (Figure 1c).24

The UV–vis absorption spectra of the BDT-COF
films grown
on quartz substrates appear as a superposition of the absorption spectra
of the COF building blocks. This suggests limited in-plane electronic
coupling between the COF building blocks, which are connected by the
boronate ester linking groups. BDT-COF absorbs mainly in the UV region
(Figure S2), corresponding to a direct
optical band gap of 2.9 eV (evaluated from a Tauc plot, Figure S3). The HOMO level of the BDT-COF was
estimated from photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements
(Figure S4) yielding a value of −5.8
± 0.1 eV. The LUMO energy level can be evaluated by adding the
optical band gap value to the HOMO energy level, ELUMO = −5.8 + 2.9 = −2.9 eV.25,26

In our previous report, we observed charge transfer from an
oriented
BDT-COF thin film toward an electron-acceptor phase, resulting in
the formation of hole-polarons within the framework.24 Here, hole-only devices with the following architecture
were prepared to study the columnar charge-transport properties of
the BDT-COF: glass/ITO/MoOx/BDT-COF/MoOx/Au (Scheme 1).27 The high work function
of MoOx permits the selective collection
of holes from the devices.28,29 For this purpose, a
thin layer of MoOx (about 10 nm) was initially
evaporated onto a glass-coated ITO electrode. Subsequently, an oriented
BDT-COF thin film was grown as described above. To complete the device,
MoOx and gold were evaporated as top electrodes.
At higher voltages, assuming ohmic injecting contacts and trap-free
transport, the current measured is space-charge limited.30 The charge-carrier mobility can be estimated
using the Mott–Gurney equation 1  where J is the current density,
εr is the dielectric constant of the COF (we used
1.7 as derived from the impedance measurements), ε0 is the permittivity of free space, μ is the charge carrier
mobility, L is the thickness of the active layer
and V is the voltage drop across the device.

To study the dependence of the charge-carrier mobility on the COF
film thickness, HODs with BDT-COF film thickness ranging from 80 to
210 nm were fabricated (Figure S5).31 Thickness dependence measurements were performed
in the dark, showing hole mobilities in the range of 3 × 10–7 to 6 × 10–9 cm2 V–1 s–1, where the highest values
are obtained for the thinner COF films (Figure 2b and Tables S1–S3). This indicates that the charge transport is limited in the bulk
rather than by the COF/electrode interfaces. We attribute this thickness
dependence to intrinsic electronic defects in the stacks of the BDT-COF
layers. For a 90 nm thick film, 260 layers (calculated for 3.45 Å
interlayer distances obtained by the X-ray diffraction data) must
stack perfectly into a single COF domain to form a flawless stack
between the two electrodes. In the case of an electronic defect in
the stack, charges cannot efficiently evade the defect by traveling
along alternative paths through the ab-plane, due
to the electronic barriers imposed by the boronate ester linking groups.

under illumination and in the dark.

Electrical conductivity measurements were carried out to
evaluate
the charge transport in the plane of the BDT-COF. Laterally placed
interdigitated gold contacts were deposited on a glass substrate,
on which the BDT-COF film was grown. Linear J–V curves were obtained (Figure S7) in the
measured voltage range. The measured conductivity in the plane was
found to be in the range of 1–5 × 10–7 S cm–1, and no significant light dependence was
observed. In comparison, the electrical conductivity we report for
the oriented BDT-COF films is higher than the two-point probe electrical
conductivity value reported for randomly oriented BDT-COF crystallites
in a compressed pellet.23 Interestingly,
our values for the BDT-COF films are only slightly lower than those
reported for an oriented imine-based COF film.19 This could be considered surprising since the conjugated
imine bonds would be expected to significantly enhance charge transport
in the plane.32 Nevertheless, the electrical
conductivity is still relatively low compared to benchmark conductive
polymers like P3HT and is expected to result in a high resistance
for charge transport in the lateral direction.

Additionally,
we performed light-dependent hole-mobility measurements
using the hole-only devices comprising ∼200 nm BDT-COF films
described above. In contrast to the conductivity measurements, a 3-fold
increase in the average hole mobility (white light LED) was observed
under illumination: 3 × 10–8 cm2 V–1 s–1 (Table S4) under illumination compared to 5 × 10–9 cm2 V–1 s–1 in the
dark (Figure 2 and Table S3). This hints at the formation of photoinduced
charges in the COF, resulting in a charge density-dependent mobility
in the film.33 We hypothesize that the
increase in hole mobility under illumination results from the increased
charge density, which allows electronic trap states to be filled.
These electronic traps could originate from unreacted functional groups
or defects in the COF structure. In particular, the presence of defects
along the columnar stacks would be in good agreement with the above
thickness-dependent mobility results. Despite the relatively low charge-carrier
mobilities measured for the BDT-COF film compared to typical semiconducting
polymers such as P3HT, the considerable increase in mobility under
illumination indicates that the BDT-COF is indeed a photoactive material.

Impedance measurements performed with the BDT-COF-based HODs in
the dark and under illumination further demonstrate the photoactive
nature of the COF material (see Figure 3a). The values for the recombination resistance (Figure 3b) measured in the
dark are an order of magnitude larger than those under illumination
throughout the entire range of measurement conditions. The capacitance
of the BDT-COF-based HODs remained constant for both dark and illuminated
systems throughout the whole measurement. Furthermore, we estimated
the dielectric constant, εr, of the oriented BDT-COF
films from the capacitance values using the following relationship 2  where C is the capacitance, d is
the thickness of the BDT-COF layer, ε0 is the permittivity
of free space, and A is the
area. Similar to the capacitance, the dielectric constant of the BDT-COF
is independent of the applied potential and has an average value of
around 1.7. We attribute this low dielectric constant to the low density
and highly porous structure of the COF film.

illumination. (b) Recombination resistance and (c) capacitance of
the HOD in the dark and under illumination. (d) Dielectric constant
for BDT-COF extracted from the impedance measurements.

To gain further insights into the BDT-COF layer
interactions and
electronic structure, we turned to theoretical simulations. The experimental
structural investigation of the BDT-COF points to an eclipsed COF
layer geometry with open one-dimensional channels. However, we expect
that a direct spatial overlap of the polar B–O bonds will lead
to some degree of electrostatic repulsion. To quantify this effect,
we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations of different
BDT-COF geometries, in which two rigid layers were displaced laterally
relative to each other (see Figure 4a). The calculations were performed at the PBE+TS/DND
level (see the Supporting Information for
details). As expected, the potential energy hypersurface exhibits
a maximum at the completely eclipsed geometry due to the electrostatic
repulsion of partially charged atoms. A displacement of 1–2
Å in any direction leads to a significant stabilization, indicating
that the structure will likely fluctuate between these low energy
conformations at room temperature. These fluctuations were studied
with classical molecular dynamics (MD) using the Dreiding force field
(see the Supporting Information for details).
From the isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble MD simulations
at ambient pressure and 300 K, we obtain equilibrated lattice parameters
that differ from the experimental values by only around 0.45%. This
small deviation confirms that our approach provides a good description
of the system. As expected, the heteroatom-rich BDT-COF is strongly
polarized, with Qeq partial charges around
0.5 e for B and −0.55 e for O. The structural strain associated
with this electrostatic repulsion is relieved by horizontal movement
of the planes relative to each other, in combination with a slight
waving of the individual layers (Figure 4b and Figure S8).

layers (in eV). (b) Snapshot from a molecular dynamics simulation

BDT-COF ring in the gas phase (from −0.1 (blue) to 0.3 (red)
Ha e–1). (d) AM1 density of states at the valence
band edge of eclipsed and displaced BDT-COF structures.

The evaluation of the BDT-COF electronic structure
with respect
to structural features can additionally assist in understanding the
potential device performance. Primarily, we aimed at the localization
of charge carriers within a COF layer. In Figure 4c, we show the electrostatic potential of
a cation (hole) plotted on an electron-density isosurface (ρ
= 0.03 e Å–3) of an isolated COF ring in the
gas-phase. Clearly, the charge carrier is localized on a single benzodithiophene
unit. Hence, if a charge carrier cannot efficiently circumvent a defect
in the BDT stack, for instance, through the COF layer, a decrease
in charge-carrier collection at the respective electrode will occur.

Fully overlapped, eclipsed configuration oligothiophenes have been
reported to exhibit the highest electronic coupling.34,35 One measure for electronic coupling in the condensed phase is the
broadening of the valence band edge in the density of states (DOS),
where high coupling leads to a stronger broadening. In Figure 4d, we show the DOS at the valence
band edge for BDT-COF structures with different layer displacements.
Evidently, the valence band edge is significantly less broadened in
an ab-1 Å displaced geometry compared to the
fully overlapped geometry. Therefore, in this particular COF system,
the coupling is strongly reduced when the spatial overlap of the layers
is small. This effect is unfavorable for charge-carrier transport,
even in the absence of structural defects.

Conclusions
In
summary, thin BDT-COF films were synthesized in an oriented
fashion on different conductive substrates. Directional charge transport
along the COF molecular columns and in the COF planes was studied.
Columnar hole mobility was measured in a diode configuration by constructing
hole-only devices (HODs). We showed that hole mobility along the BDT-COF
stacks is feasible and that the charge transport depends on the COF
film thickness. This dependency can be attributed to transport barriers
within the BDT-COF stacks that cannot be easily overcome though alternative
transport paths. Indeed, in-plane electrical conductivity measurements
of oriented BDT-COF films indicated a relatively high resistivity
toward charge migration attributed to the COF boronate ester linking
groups. HODs measured under illumination show an enhanced hole mobility,
thus demonstrating BDT-COF to be a photoactive material. Impedance
measurements in the dark and under illumination further illustrate
the photoactive nature of the BDT-COF; the recombination resistance
decreases significantly under illumination. Moreover, we observed
an exceptionally low dielectric constant for the BDT-COF films, which
we attribute to the highly porous character of the COF. Simulations
elucidate the relationship between the BDT-COF layer dynamics and
the
electronic structure. A certain degree of layer-to-layer displacement
is expected for the BDT-COF due to the highly polarized B–O
bonds. This leads to a decrease of the layer-to-layer electronic coupling,
translating into a narrowed density of states at the valence band
edge. We therefore expect that thiophene COFs with maximized overlap
between adjacent layers will show enhanced transport properties. Furthermore,
providing alternative charge-migration paths within the COF planes
will help to evade stacking defects and improve charge collection.

Methods
General Methods
All materials (if not noted otherwise)
were purchased from Aldrich, Fluka, or Acros in the common purities
purum and puriss. 2,3,6,7,10,11-Hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) was
purchased from TCI Europe. All materials were used without further
purification. The building block benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyldiboronic acid (BDTBA) was
prepared according to our previously reported synthesis route. Analytical
data of intermediates were found to match literature data.20,36

BDT-COF Thin-Film Synthesis
A conventional stainless
steel autoclave equipped with a 20 mL Teflon liner was charged with
BDTBA (2) (16.2 mg, 0.058 mmol) and HHTP (12.5 mg, 0.038 mmol). The
reaction mixture was suspended in 5 mL of a 1:1 v/v solution of mesitylene/dioxane.
Two clean electrodes were placed horizontally on a homemade, ∏-shaped
Teflon holder equipped with three slide compartments. The Teflon holder
was placed into the starting material suspension in a way that the
conductive side of the electrode faced the bottom of the autoclave.
The autoclave was then heated for 12 h at 100 °C. The substrates
were then removed and washed with anhydrous acetone (100 μL)
and dried under a stream of N2. Thicker homogeneous COF
films were obtained on the electrodes located in the lower Teflon
holder compartment; thinner films were obtained on the electrode placed
in the upper compartment.

Fabrication of Hole-Only Devices
Hole-only devices
were prepared by adjusting published procedures.27,37−39 ITO substrates (1.5 × 2.0 cm, VisionTek, 12–15
Ω/sq) were etched using Zn powder and a 2 M HCl solution and
cleaned with HELLMANEX soap and ethanol and were blown dry using pressured
air. The substrates were plasma cleaned prior to the thermal deposition
of the MoOx layer (10 nm) under vacuum
(1 × 10–6 mbar). The substrates were exposed
to air and stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Next, the BDT-COF
layer was grown on the substrates as described above. A top electrode
of MoOx (10 nm) followed by a layer of
gold (100 nm) was deposited under vacuum (1 × 10–6 mbar). The active area was 16 mm2. Current–voltage
characteristics were recorded in air using a Metrohm potentiostat
(PGSTAT302N) at a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1. Measurements
under light were performed by illuminating the samples from the glass
side, using a Metrohm cool white light LED (LDCCW, 6500 K) with an
intensity of approximately 1000 W m–2. The layer
thickness was determined by using AFM measurements which were performed
in tapping mode using a NanoInk DPN Stage microscope or with an SEM
using a JEOL 6500F instrument.

In-Plane Conductivity Measurements
For conductivity
measurements, precleaned glass substrates were prepared by deposition
of Ti/Au (10/40 nm thick) interdigitating electrodes. The electrode
pattern was designed for two point-probe measurements with a channel
length of 250 μm, and a channel width of 0.2 m was used. BDT-COF
films with a thickness of approximately 200 nm were grown as described
above onto the interdigitated regions. J–V curves were recorded under ambient conditions with a Keithley
2400 source meter at a scan rate of 0.1 and 1 V s–1, respectively. Measurements under light were performed by illuminating
the samples from the glass side, using simulated AM 1.5G sunlight,
with an incident power of 1000 mW m–2.

X-ray
diffraction analysis was carried out in reflection mode using a Bruker
D8 Discover with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å)
and a position-sensitive detector (LynxEye). Small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) was carried out with a SAXSpace instrument system (Anton Paar)
equipped with a Princeton Instruments SCX CCD camera. The sample was
subjected to the X-ray beam at a grazing angle of 0.24° with
respect to the primary beam. The X-rays scattered perpendicular q(z) and parallel q(y) to the surface normal were detected by the CDD camera
covering wide angles, corresponding to 8.36° 2θ in the q(z) axis and 15.94° 2θ in the q(y) axis. The wavelength of the incident
beam was λ = 0.154 nm (Cu Kα); the sample–detector
distance was 168.15 mm.

Scanning electron microscope images
were recorded with JEOL 6500F
and Zeiss Ultra Plus field emission scanning electron microscopes.
Samples were carbon coated prior to the measurements. The AFM data
were collected with a nanoInk DPN-Stage atomic force microscope operated
in tapping mode.

UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Lambda
1050 spectrometer
(PerkinElmer) equipped with an integrating sphere. Thin films were
measured in transmission geometry and corrected for reflection losses.
The work function of the BDT-COF was measured using a Riken photoelectron
spectrometer in air (PESA) (model AC-2) at 20 nW.

Impedance
measurements were carried out using a potentiostat equipped
with a frequency response analyzer (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, Metrohm)
and LED driver. The measurements were carried out under cool white
LED (LDCCW, Metrohm) irradiation at different applied DC voltages
over the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.02 Hz.

Computational
Studies
The MD model system was based
on the experimentally reported unit cell of BDT-COF, which we expanded
to a hexagonal supercell approximately sized 74 × 74 × 75
Å and containing 9577 atoms. The simulations were performed using
the Dreiding force field as implemented in the Forcite Plus module
of Materials Studio. Charges for the periodic COF network were calculated
via the Qeq scheme.40 Electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were treated
via the Ewald summation method with a 6 Å cutoff on the repulsive
contribution to the van der Waals energy.

The Dreiding force
field has been shown to provide high quality descriptions of polythiophenes
in the condensed phase when combined with charges from ab initio calculations
or empirical schemes.41 We compared the
charges calculated with the Qeq model
to results from B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculations using the MK model.42−44 Both charges are in qualitative agreement, but the DFT calculations
are artificially polarized due to the capping of the COF fragments
used, while the Qeq model could be applied
directly to the periodic system.

Semiempirical molecular orbital
theory calculations were performed
with EMPIRE’13 using the AM1 Hamiltonian and periodic boundary
conditions.45−48 DFT calculations were performed at the PBE/DND level using the TS
dispersion correction and a 1 × 1 × 2 k point mesh as implemented
in DMol3.49−51
