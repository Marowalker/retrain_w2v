Peptide
self-assembly has attracted extensive interest in the field
of eco-friendly optoelectronics and bioimaging due to its inherent
biocompatibility, intrinsic fluorescence, and flexible modulation.
However, the practical application of such materials was hindered
by the relatively low quantum yield of such assemblies. Here, inspired
by the molecular structure of BFPms1, we explored the “self-assembly
locking strategy” to design and manipulate the assembly of
metal-stabilized cyclic(l-histidine-d-histidine)
into peptide material with the high-fluorescence efficiency. We used
this bioorganic material as an emissive layer in photo- and electroluminescent
prototypes, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing self-assembling
peptides to fabricate a biointegrated microchip that incorporates
eco-friendly and tailored optoelectronic properties. We further employed
a “self-encapsulation” strategy for constructing an
advanced nanocarrier with integrated in situ monitoring.
The strategy of the supramolecular capture of functional components
exemplifies the use of bioinspired organic chemistry to provide frontiers
of smart materials, potentially allowing a better interface between
sustainable optoelectronics and biomedical applications.

Bioorganic
molecules with intrinsic
fluorescence are highly desired in biomedicine and biotechnology as
they allow the tracking and monitoring of fundamental biological processes
without complicated and potentially toxic labeling.1−3 The search for
alternatives that offer higher performance and ease of tunability,
such as flexible, functional modulation and enhanced eco-friendliness,
is still ongoing.4−6 Peptides, as a natural ingredient of biological systems,
self-assembling through extensive and directed hydrogen bonding, and
aromatic interactions, are intriguing candidates for this purpose,
thus prompting extensive efforts to utilize these properties toward
developing next-generation functional biomaterials.7−19 The most prominent example is diphenylalanine, a dipeptide initially
identified as the smallest core recognition motif of β-amyloid,
the amyloidogenic polypeptide associated with Alzheimer’s disease,
which self-assembles into diverse nanostructures potentially useful
in the biomedical field for biosensing.20−22 However, the majority
of intrinsically fluorescent peptides have low quantum yields and
photostability, which severely hinders their practical applications
and specifically limits their potential as eco-friendly materials
for optoelectronic devices and efficient bioimaging probes.23

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been
extensively used as a
genetically encoded fluorescent marker in biology. Specifically, a
GFP mutant (BFPms1) that preferentially binds to Zn(II) has been developed.
Zn(II) binding rigidifies the chromophore imidazole, reduces fluorophore
mobility, and further limits the energy dissipation through thermal
relaxation pathways, resulting in the enhanced fluorescence (Figure 1a).24 Inspired by this molecular structure, we aimed to design
a metal-binding site on a short peptide to simulate metal coordination
and design an electrostatic interaction site to generate supramolecular
hosts of a β-fold barrel environment for self-locking, thereby
fabricating the minimalist version of this sophisticated biological
structure to provide a scalable technological solution (Figure 1b).14 Cyclic peptides derived from amino acid residues carrying complexing
side chain substituents, such as imidazole, carboxylate, or thioether
groups, can be used as models to mimic the coordination of metal ions
in enzymes.25−30 Also, cyclic dipeptide is highly tunable due to hydrogen bonding
capabilities of the skeleton and other noncovalent interactions that
can be used to engineer artificial multifunctional scaffolds.31,32

Here, we explored the assembly of cyclic(l-histidine-d-histidine) (CHH) and constructed highly fluorescent peptide
dots with a large quantum yield (>0.7) through “self-assembly
locking strategy”. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated CHH
self-assemblies to show bright fluorescence, allowing their use as
an emissive layer in the photo- and electroluminescent light-emitting
diodes (LEDs). Moreover, we utilized the “self-encapsulation”
strategy to construct a nanocarrier to effectively deliver an anticancer
drug into cancer cells with in situ monitoring. Our
studies show that, analogously to diphenylalanine, CHH is a type of
pioneering minimalistic self-assembling peptide, which shows that
bioinspired supramolecular functional components can be applied as
multifunctional nanomaterials with exceptional features for optoelectronic
or biological applications.

Results and Discussion
To allow
their coassembly, CHH and Zn(NO3)2 (CHH–Zn)
were mixed under controlled experimental conditions,
resulting in nanostructure formation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging confirmed the presence
of nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼30 nm (Figures 1c and S1) which is in agreement with dynamic light
scattering (DLS) data (Figure S2). Next,
we explored the optical properties of the CHH–Zn nanostructures. Figure 1d shows the normalized
UV–vis absorption and excitation–emission matrix contour
profiles of the CHH–Zn assemblies (Figures S3 and S4). In particular, by introducing Zn ions to the cyclic
dipeptide an absorption peak extending between 350 to 450 nm was observed,
indicating the formation of a Zn-related coordination structure.33 Upon excitation at 390 nm, the CHH–Zn
peptide nanocrystals exhibited bright fluorescence emission centered
at 500 nm (inset image in Figures 1e and S5). With the excitation
wavelength changes from 330 to 450 nm (Figure S6), visible photoluminescence showed a pronounced red shift
from cyan to green and variation of the central peak from 490 to 520
nm along with excellent linearity of the chromaticity coordinates.
Such red shift in the fluorescence emission spectra in response to
a change in the excitation wavelength is termed as red edge excitation
shift (REES).13,34 Notably, the maximum photoluminescence
efficiency of the CHH–Zn self-assembly was about 70.6% (Figures 1f and S7), among the highest values reported so far
for peptide-derived materials and even comparable to inorganic quantum
dots or GFP.35−38

We further combined spectroscopic methods and control experiments
to obtain specific chemical and structural information. We found that
all Zn(II) present in the assembled system displayed a strong and
stable fluorescence signal and similar absorption and emission spectra,
whereas the sodium nitrate-related self-assembly system and CHH showed
similar absorption spectra and weak fluorescence emission intensity
(Figures S4 and S8). Therefore, it can be inferred that the Zn(II)-peptide coordinated
structure is formed by supplying Zn(II) to the cyclic dipeptide system,
which in turn determines the optical properties. NMR was further used
to predict the possible coordination structure. As shown in Figure 1g and Figure S9, the imine protons of the side-chain
imidazole ring downshifted Δδ = 0.143 ppm (a position) after the addition of Zn(II), implying strong coordination
through imine–imidazole nitrogen.40 This coordination of the CHH imidazole ring with Zn(II) is also
consistent with previous studies of carbonic anhydrase and β-amyloid
peptide, where the histidine residue has a high affinity for the complexation
of Zn.33,41,42 The coordination
of Zn ion and imidazole ring was further verified by mass spectrometry
analysis of CHH with Zn(NO3)2, showing an m/z 611.2 band corresponding to the oligomer
of [2MCHH + Zn2+] (Figure S10). Moreover, a Job plot analysis determined the CHH/Zn(NO3)2 stoichiometric ratio as 2:1, which is in contrast
to the 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of CHH/Zn(II) (Figure 1h and Figure S11), thus indicating the presence of another assembled structure in
addition to the Zn–peptide coordination. We therefore propose
a specific self-assembly mechanism mediating CHH packing with nitrate.

To validate our hypothesis and further characterize the specific
self-assembly mechanism, we crystallized both CHH–Zn(II) and
CHH–NaNO3 and analyzed the resulting structures
via X-ray crystallography (Table S1). The
CHH–Zn(II) crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pbcn with one CHH molecule, one neutral [Zn(L)2I2] unit, and one isopropanol molecule per asymmetric
unit. A perspective view of the Zn(II) center of the CHH–Zn(II)
compound is illustrated in Figure 2a with a unit cell scheme. Each Zn(II) atom was coordinated
with two ligands and two N-donor atoms from the imidazole groups of
two different CHH molecules, occupying the apical coordination sites
to generate a Zn(II) centered geometric tetrahedron. In turn, two
adjacent cyclic dipeptides were connected through a β-bridgelike
hydrogen bonding on the opposite sides of the backbone. The X-ray
determined structure of CHH–NaNO3 revealed a packing
of the cyclic-dipeptides crystal in the monoclinic space group P21/c with two CHH and four
nitrates in the unit cell (Figure 2b). The components assembled to form a 1D chain with
a hydrogen bond (N—H···O=C) of 2.889
Å (donor···acceptor) via a parallel β-sheet
hydrogen bonding network. The adjacent chains formed the extended
structure through hydrogen bonds between the imidazole ring and nitrate
groups.

studies of the CHH–Zn(NO3)2 single crystal.
(f) Lifetime distribution histogram derived from the FLIM study, showing
two peaks centered at 1318 and 1890 ps. Scale bar is 50 μm.

We further examined CHH–Zn(NO3)2 single
crystals through crystallographic analysis. By employing a microfluids
technique (Figure 2c, Figures S12, S13, and Movie S1), it is possible to visually observe that the Zn(NO3)2 crystals are densely packed with a growth rate
of 0.01 μm s–1 along the a direction, ultimately forming a needle shape. The resulting powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern and unit cell parameters of the CHH–Zn
self-assemblies highly resembled those of the formed CHH–Zn(NO3)2 crystals, indicating a similar molecular organization
(Figure 2d and Figure S14). Surprisingly, the needle-shaped
CHH–Zn(NO3)2 and the plaque-shaped CHH–NaNO3 crystal are isomorphous despite different crystal morphologies.
Importantly, the Zn ion is not incorporated in the CHH–Zn(NO3)2 single crystal structure, suggesting that the
growth of the CHH–Zn(II) oligomer may be mostly restricted
by the CHH–nitrate self-assembly process. To validate our hypothesis
and elucidate the effect of the CHH–Zn(II) oligomer on the
CHH–Zn(NO3)2 crystal photodynamic properties,
we performed confocal fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) studies
of CHH–Zn(NO3)2 single crystals (Figure 2e). Figure 2f presents the lifetime distribution
histogram using a multiexponential fit of the decays. Interestingly,
a highly heterogeneous lifetime distribution could be observed for
the CHH–Zn(NO3)2 single crystal, and
the envelope of lifetime (τ) histogram could be divided into
two independent fluorescence decay processes with two clearly differentiated
Gaussian distributions centered at 1318 and 1890 ps. This data confirmed
that the two lifetime values originated from the fluorescence decay
of the two individual components, which could be assigned to the fluorescence
emission within the CHH–Zn(II) oligomer and CHH–nitrate.43 In addition, CHH–Zn(NO3)2 forms yellow needle crystals, whereas CHH–NaNO3 gives rise to colorless transparent plaque crystals and the
fluorescence emission intensity of CHH–Zn(NO3)2 is much higher than that of CHH–NaNO3 (Figures S15 and S16).

We computationally
investigated the self-assembly of the two systems,
independently comprising CHH–Zn(NO3)2 and CHH–ZnCl2, in isopropanol, using multiple
explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in CHARMM.44 In both systems, we observed the gradual formation
of dimer structures having two β-bridge-bonded CHH coordinating
with one Zn(II) ion (Figure S17), similar
to the X-ray crystallography data, and the gradual formation of aggregate
clusters formed by the constituent elements of each system. In line
with the experimental findings of the Job plot analysis (Figure 1h), mature clusters
in the CHH–Zn(NO3)2 simulations showed
a CHH/Zn(NO3)2 ratio of approximately 2:1, whereas
mature clusters in the CHH–Zn(II) simulations displayed a CHH/ZnCl2 ratio of approximately 1:1 (Table S2). Within both sets of simulations, CHH molecules were observed to
form antiparallel β-bridge conformations with the imidazole
rings of two histidine molecules of opposing CHH dipeptides coordinated
with the same Zn(II) ion, similar to the conformations observed in
the CHH–Zn(II) crystal structure of (Figures 2a and 3a and Table S3). In the simulations comprising CHH–Zn(II)
and NO3–, these antiparallel conformations
were predominantly observed within the interior CHH–Zn(II)
nucleus of the clusters (Figure 3d). We also observed that the radius of gyration of
Zn(II) within the clusters formed in the presence of NO3– was lower compared to those formed in the absence
of NO3–, showing that for clusters containing
the same number of CHH molecules Zn(II) ions were more densely packed
and concentrated in the clusters formed in the presence of NO3– (Figure 3b). Importantly, in the clusters formed by CHH–Zn(NO3)2 our computational analysis detected layers in
which the exterior surface layer was composed of primarily CHH and
NO3–, whereas the interior layer was
composed primarily of CHH and Zn(II) (Figure 3c).

surfaces, respectively. Interior and exterior CHH are shown with blue
and light blue transparent surfaces, respectively. (e) Schematic illustration
of the plausible self-assembly process of CHH–Zn assemblies.

We further aimed to provide insight into the formation
of the CHH–Zn(NO3)2 clusters by performing
free-energy analysis
of the different pathways which may lead to their formation. On the
basis of the free-energy analysis, CHH and Zn(II) coordinate first,
forming the interior of the clusters, followed by individual pieces
of the CHH and NO3– exterior wrapping
around the preformed interior (Figures 3d and S18a). This mechanism
was supported through structural analysis in which the composition
of the large CHH clusters was tracked as a function of time (Figure S19a). Thus, CHH–Zn(NO3)2 self-assembles through a “self-assembly locking
strategy” in which the fluorescent CHH–Zn(II) nucleus
is encased by the CHH–NO3– scaffold. Figure 3d and Movie S2 show the initial formation of the internal
CHH–Zn(II) nucleus, followed by the exterior CHH–NO3– wrapping around the preformed nucleus.
Our combined experimental and computational analysis suggests that
the CHH–Zn(II) oligomer is encapsulated into CHH–NO3– assemblies and that immobilization of
the peptide oligomers by a high-stiffness scaffold would limit energy
dissipation during thermal relaxation pathways for better quantum
yield and fluorescence intensity.45

On the basis of our experimental and computational analyses, a
plausible self-assembly mechanism of CHH and Zn(NO3)2 is depicted in Figure 3e. The self-assembly of the CHH and Zn(II) can be observed
at initial oligomerization step. Following the coordination of Zn(II)
with the two histidine side-chains and stabilization of the dimer,
the CHH monomers begin to form hydrogen bond interactions between
their backbone atoms, forming a one-dimensional chain via β-sheet
bridgelike interactions and subsequently generating an extended network
through the linkage of nitrates. As the CHH one-dimensional chain
grows, the chelation of CHH and Zn(II) is limited. Finally, the CHH–Zn(II)
oligomer clusters are encapsulated and incorporated into CHH–NO3– nanoassemblies.

Intrigued by the
optical properties of the characterized assemblies,
we sought to study their capability to serve as an emissive material
in photo- and electroluminescent prototypes. As shown in Figure 4a, we prepared peptide-based
phosphors by embedding CHH–Zn into polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
at the mass ratio of 1:70. The peptide-based phosphor converted LED
emitted bright green light with Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage
(CIE) color coordinates of (0.31, 0.45) and achieved high luminous
efficiency of 56.62 lm W–1 at 20 mA drive current
(Figure S21). We further sought to study
the utilization of CHH–Zn as a bio-organic light-emitting material
in optoelectronics. A simple natural peptide derived bio-organic-LED
(OLED) prototype was fabricated by using CHH–Zn-blended poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) as an emissive layer (Figures 4b and S22). As illustrated in Figure 4b, the operation photographs present a close-up
view of the bright, uniform, and defect-free surface green electroluminescence
emission from the peptide-based OLED. The typical luminance and current
density curves as a function of the applied voltage for the OLED are
demonstrated in Figure S23. The maximum
EQE is 0.25%, corresponding to a current efficiency of 0.58 cd A–1 (the corresponding Lmax is 1385 cd m–2) (Figure S24). Because of the stable fluorescence, the bio-OLED showed no temporal
degradation in the emission spectrum under the applied operating conditions,
indicating significant potential for practical applications.

Because self-assembled peptide nanoparticles are
composed of naturally
occurring amino acids with inherent biocompatibility, peptide self-assembly
with intrinsic fluorescence is suitable for bioimaging.46−48 High-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa
cells were collected following incubation with CHH–Zn and the
DRAQ5 red DNA stain. The CHH–Zn structures were found to penetrate
the cells and display bright green fluorescence under excitation of
405 nm (Figure S25). More notably, three-dimensional
(3D) imaging analysis indicated that CHH–Zn could effectively
transport through the nuclear pore complex of HeLa cells and accumulate
within the nucleolus region (Figures S26 and S27). Also, in vitro cytotoxicity analysis shown in Figure S28 demonstrated the excellent cytocompatibility
of CHH–Zn peptide nanoparticles toward HeLa cells. On the basis
of the membrane permeability feature of the developed intrinsically
fluorescent peptide structures, we further aimed to demonstrate their
potential applications for drug delivery.49

We experimentally confirmed the coassembly of CHH–Zn
and
Epirubicin, an anthracycline drug used for chemotherapy, through absorbance
spectra, showing a 15.67% loading capacity of Epirubicin within the
CHH–Zn nanoassemblies. We computationally investigated the
self-assembly properties of CHH, Zn(NO3)2 and
Epirubicin in water using multiple explicit solvent runs using CHARMM.44 In all simulations, we detected the gradual
formation of clusters comprising CHH, Zn(II), NO3–, and Epirubicin (Figure S19d) in which
Epirubicin and Zn(II) were primarily located in the interior nucleus
whereas CHH and NO3– were primarily at
the exterior surface (Figures 4d, S19c, and S20), thereby depicting
the self-encapsulation properties of the system. Free energy calculations
(Figure S18b–d) and structural analysis
(Figure S19c) show that individual or pairs
of CHHs pulled Zn(II) from the solvent environment into a more peptide-like
environment through an “environment-switching” mechanism.50 The Epirubicin molecules first aggregate and
form the inner nucleus of the clusters which further facilitates the
assembly of individual pieces of CHH and NO3– exteriorly wrapping around the preformed Epirubicin (Figure 4 panels d (ΔG1) and e, and Movie S3).

To examine the drug delivery potential of the nanoassemblies, HeLa
cells incubated with CHH–Zn+Epirubicin or Epirubicin alone
were examined by live-cell confocal microscopy. The fluorescence intensity
of intracellular Epirubicin in cells incubated with CHH–Zn+Epirubicin
was significantly higher than that of Epirubicin alone, indicating
efficient Epirubicin uptake and release into the nucleolus of HeLa
cells via the CHH–Zn carrier (Figure 4c). The Epirubicin release profiles (Figures S29 and S30) suggested that the release
of Epirubicin from the CHH–Zn can be efficiently triggered
and accelerated by an acidic stimulus, which is favored for the acidic
extracellular microenvironment of tumor tissues.51,52 In order to further monitor the Epirubicin release process and eliminate
autofluorescence from the biological system, we applied the two-photon
FLIM technique with phasor analysis.53,54 Pixels with
similar lifetimes are selected in the phasor diagram and the FLIM
image is separated and painted into four subcellular compartments:
cell membrane (∼3512 ps), cytoplasm (∼2286 ps), nucleus
membrane (∼1595 ps), and nucleus (∼1261 ps) (Figure S31). After internalizing of Epirubicin
into the cells, changes in its fluorescence lifetime can thus indicate
changes in the subcellular microenvironment, reflecting drug release
and transport. With elongation of incubation time (Figure 4f,g), more Epirubicin was released
and, consequently, the fluorescence intensity of Epirubicin gradually
increased, along with a decrease in the average lifetime. These results
indicated that the CHH–Zn+Epirubicin could accumulate around
and bind to the cell membrane as early as 35 min of incubation with
HeLa cells and then be released in the cytoplasm due to the acidic
environment and eventually accumulate in the nucleus. In addition,
the release behavior of CHH–Zn+Epirubicin could be monitored
by the variation of the fluorescent signal of CHH–Zn (Figure S32), showing that CHH–Zn not only
promoted the transport of Epirubicin into HeLa cells but also can
be acted as a real-time optical monitor for the drug release process.
Thus, the fluorescence of peptide nanostructures can be used to investigate
the drug release in spatiotemporal mode and metabolism kinetics of
cancer drugs in a certain organ or tissue.

Conclusion
Within
this study, inspired by the structure of BFPms1, we successfully
constructed a fluorescent short peptide core encapsulated by the peptide
scaffold building module to implement the concept of “self-assembly
locking strategy”. We report the demonstration of a bright
fluorescent peptide with quantum yields of up to 70% for green fluorescence,
exemplifying the potential of such structures to serve as bioinspired,
organic, supramolecular alternatives to complement the state-of-the-art
inorganic counterparts. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the
utilization of these bright fluorescence peptide self-assemblies for
eco-friendly optoelectronics and bioimaging. In particular, we show
their capability to serve as an emissive layer for a bioinspired OLED
prototype. Moreover, we employ the “self-encapsulation”
strategy for fabricating an advanced nanocarrier for traceable intracellular
drug delivery. These results allow us to envision CHH as a promising
platform for further therapeutic or diagnostic applications, particularly
in anticancer treatments. This efficient yet straightforward bottom-up
approach for the design of highly efficient fluorescent peptide nanostructures
may represent a strategy for developing peptide-based advanced nanomaterials.

In a typical protocol, CHH–Zn(NO3)2 crystalline powder was inserted into the device.
Then, a flow of fresh solutions was injected at a rate of 4 μL
h–1 using Cetoni GmbH neMESYS Syringe Pumps (Korbussen,
Germany) and glass HAMILTON syringes, 1,725 TLL of 250 μL. The
process was examined under an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon,
Japan), equipped with a Zyla 4.2+ sCMOS camera (Andor, U.K.), and

min. The mixtures were applied on the InGaN chips and, following curing
at 80 °C for 1 h, the LEDs peptide phosphors were obtained.

ITO-coated
glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in organic
solvents (acetone and isopropyl alcohol), rinsed in deionized water,
and then dried in an oven at 150 °C for 10 min. The substrates
were cleaned by a UV-ozone treatment to enrich the ITO surface with
oxygen, thereby increasing its work function. The approximately 30
nm thick PEDOT:PSS hole injection layer was spin-coated at 3000 rpm
for 30 s on the ITO, followed by annealing in an oven at 150 °C
for 15 min. Subsequently, the emissive layer of CHH–Zn blended
into PVK was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 35 s over the surface of
the PEDOT:PSS film from the solution of NMP, followed by baking on
a hot plate at 80 °C for 15 min to form the active region of
the peptide-derived bio-OLED. Finally, the substrates were transferred
to a vacuum chamber, and a 30 nm thick TPBI electron transport layer
was thermally deposited with base pressure of 3 × 10–4 Pa. Next, a 20 nm Ca and 100 nm thick Al cathode was deposited using
a shadow mask 2 mm in width. The active area of the devices was thus
4 mm2. The thermal deposition rates for TPBI and Ca/Al
were 1, 1, and 3 Å s–1, respectively. The thickness
of the films was measured using a Dektak XT (Bruker) surface profilometer
and a spectroscopic ellipsometer (Suntech). The luminance–current–voltage
(L–I–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley
236 SMU and Keithley 200 multimeter coupled with a calibrated Si photodiode.
Electroluminescence spectra were measured by an Ocean Optics 2000
spectrometer, which couples a linear charge-coupled device array detector
ranging from 350 to 800 nm.

Live Cells Imaging Using Confocal Microscopy
HeLa cells
were grown to 70–80% confluence in glass bottom cell culture
dishes. Then, the cells were cultured with media containing the CHH–Zn+EPI
at a concentration of 4 μg/mL for different durations. Next,
the cells were stained using a DRAQ5 dye diluted 1:1000 in PBS for
15 min at room temperature in the dark to allow staining of the nuclei.
The cells were then washed twice with PBS. Imaging was performed using
SP8 inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Excitation and emission ranges were the following: λex = 405 nm, λem = 420–500 nm; EPI, λex = 543 nm, λem = 550–750 nm; DRAQ5,
λex = 633 nm, λem = 750–780
nm.

FLIM Analysis of Cultured Cells
HeLa cells seeded in
dishes were treated with CHH–Zn+EPI at a concentration of 4
μg mL–1 for 30, 76, 125, 194, 270, and 420
min, followed by washing with PBS. The time-resolved fluorescence
signal was acquired using an LSM 7 MP two-photon microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Weimar, Germany) coupled to the Becker and Hickl (BH) simple-Tau-152
system. Images were acquired through a Zeiss 20×/1 NA water-immersion
objective. A Zeiss dichroic mirror (T690) was used to separate the
excitation and the emission light. An additional barrier filter was
used to block emission light above 690 nm. Emission light was separated
by a dichroic mirror (555 nm) and the two fluorescent lights were
filtered by two band-pass filters (500–550 and 590–650
nm). Pseudocolored lifetime images were generated by assigning a color
to the value of average fluorescence lifetime τm at
each pixel. Emission light was collected via a hybrid GaAsP detector
(HPM-100-40, BH, Berlin, Germany) with a Cherry bandpass filter.
