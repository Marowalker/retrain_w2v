Supramolecular
antenna-ring complexes are of great interest due
to their presence in natural light-harvesting complexes. While such
systems are known to provide benefits through robust and efficient
energy funneling, the relationship between molecular structure, strain
(governed by nuclear coordinates and motion), and energy dynamics
(arising from electronic behavior) is highly complex. We present a
synthetic antenna-nanoring system based on a series of conjugated
porphyrin chromophores ideally suited to explore such effects. By
systematically varying the size of the acceptor nanoring, we reveal
the interplay between antenna-nanoring binding, local strain, and
energy dynamics on the picosecond time scale. Binding of the antenna
unit creates a local strain in the nanoring, and this strain was measured
as a function of the size of the nanoring, by UV–vis-NIR titration,
providing information on the conformational flexibility of the system.
Strikingly, the energy-transfer rate is independent of nanoring size,
indicating the existence of strain-localized acceptor states, spread
over about six porphyrin units, arising from the noncovalent antenna-nanoring
association.

Supramolecular
complexes of
chromophores arranged in a cyclic structure are of interest for energy-harvesting
applications, due to their occurrence in natural light-harvesting
systems such as the LH2 complex of Rhodopseudomonas acidophilia.1 In natural complexes, chromophores
with a range of absorption wavelengths are present with the effect
of both broadening the spectral absorption of the complex and driving
energy migration toward a reaction center.2,3 A
cyclic arrangement of chromophores further modifies the energy levels
of the component chromophores, altering the interchromophore interaction.4 Much research has been motivated by the desire
to elucidate the range of physical processes that lead to robustness
and high efficiency of the energy-transfer mechanism, with the twin
goals of understanding any potential roles of molecular structure
and quantum mechanics in biological systems5−7 and designing
synthetic (biomimetic) light-harvesting systems.8−10 In particular,
the role of both static (structural) and dynamic (thermal) disorder
is of great interest due to the critical importance of symmetry and
delocalization in the cyclic systems.

Here, we report fundamental
insights into such effects, by unraveling
the mechanisms of energy transfer and binding strain in a series of
biomimetic antenna-nanoring complexes of varying diameter. While it
might be presumed that the size of the natural systems are optimized
for solar light harvesting in their specific environments, studies
of the relationship between the rate of energy transfer and the size
of the acceptor nanoring are extremely challenging. Previous investigations
on dendritic synthetic light-harvesting molecules have revealed a
decrease in transfer efficiency as molecule size increases,11,12 however until now, systematic study has typically been prohibited
by synthetic challenges.

Porphyrin nanorings generally show
large exciton delocalization
lengths for both singlet and triplet states;13,14 for nanoring acceptors of between 6 and 12 units, we would anticipate
that this delocalization would lead to a spatial extent of the acceptor
exciton wave function across the whole nanoring.13 The delocalization results in a redshift in absorption
with increasing nanoring size,13,15 along with a reduction
in radiative rate linked to a symmetry-forbidden ground state.16 In the antenna-nanoring complex, one would expect
this to cause a drop in energy-transfer rate within the Förster
framework, because of the increased “center-of-mass”
distance between the donor and acceptor states. However, we demonstrate
here that, surprisingly, the noncovalent binding of an antenna molecule
instead leads to strain-induced localization of the exciton state
on the nanoring. Strikingly, the emergence of a low-energy localized
state on the nanoring results in energy transfer from the dimer antenna
to the nanoring being independent of nanoring size. This reveals both
challenges and possibilities within supramolecular design, requiring
a detailed consideration of strain on energy states in noncovalent
complexes as well as showing that such strain can be used as an additional
method to tune the local energy landscape.

The sensitive relationship
between nuclear disorder and electronic
dynamics is both complex and important for light-harvesting molecules17,18 and synthetic nanorings.19,20 In particular, excited-state
delocalization and photophysics in cyclic molecules have been widely
studied in a number of systems, including cycloparaphenylenes,21 cyclic oligothiophenes,22 and cyclic porphyrin oligomers16,23 as well as
from a theoretical standpoint.15 Here,
findings can be broadly divided into two categories: those for which
static disorder arising from the chemical environment leads to a long-term
preferred exciton localization site,24,25 and those
for which thermal fluctuations dominate leading to a stochastic emission
site,26 often depending on nanoring size.27 While there is clear evidence that nanoring
molecules allow for dynamic localization of excited states,20 the impact of this upon antenna-nanoring energy-transfer
dynamics is as yet unstudied.

Here we investigate the energy
transfer from a porphyrin dimer
antenna (P2py2) to nanorings of different sizes (c-P6, c-P8, c-P10, c-P12, and c-P30, Scheme 1).12,28−31 These systems provide a highly controlled synthetic framework with
a well-defined supramolecular topology. Use of a dimer antenna provides
strong binding and allows for unambiguous control of the lowest-lying
dipole transition orientation with respect to that of the nanoring.
The binding constants for these complexes, determined by UV–vis-NIR
titration, provide a direct experimental measure of the mechanical
rigidity of the nanorings and of the strain imposed by binding the
antenna unit to each nanoring. By combining stoichiometry, photophysics,
binding constant, and strain calculations with modeling of energy-transfer
rates, we demonstrate the existence of strain-localized acceptor states
that remarkably cause the energy-transfer rate to be independent of
nanoring size.

Results and Discussion
Determination of Stoichiometry
Each free-base P2py2 antenna unit can bind to the
zinc-porphyrin nanorings via two Zn–N coordination
sites, so that a c-PN nanoring with N zinc centers
might be expected
to bind to N/2 antenna units to form a complex of
the type c-PN·(P2py2)N/2. We started this study by testing
whether complexes of this stoichiometry are formed, using the Job
plot method of continuous variation,32,33 by means of
UV–vis-NIR spectroscopy. In these titrations, the total concentration
of all the components was kept constant while varying the molar ratio
of host (c-PN) to guest (P2py2). The stoichiometry
of each complex was obtained from the abscissa of the maximum of the
Job plot, where the x- and y-axes
are given by  1   2  where [H] and [G] are the total concentrations
of host (c-PN) and guest (P2py2) at the initial
state, respectively; Aobs is the observed
absorbance at a specific wavelength; εH and εG are the molar absorption coefficients of the host and guest
at that wavelength, respectively. The x error bars
reflect uncertainty in [H] and [G] (originating from uncertainty in
εH and εG).

The resulting
Job plots and UV–vis-NIR spectra are shown in Figure 1a–e. The changes in
the absorption spectra on binding show that the dimers absorb at shorter
wavelengths than the nanorings and that complexation results in a
slight red-shift of the Q-bands, due to the effects of local planarization
on exciton delocalization.

nanoring from 0 (thick red) to 1 (black lines). (Right) Job plots
of the complex formations with red and black dots corresponding to
the absorbance difference as shown in the legend. Red and black dashed
lines are given as a guide to the eye.

The Job plot for c-P6 shows that a 1:2 complex is formed instead of the expected 1:3 complex.
This conclusion was confirmed by 1H NMR titration (see Supporting Information). The formation of a 1:2
complex, but not a 1:3 complex, can be explained by the increased
strain in the ring upon binding P2py2 to c-P6.

The three medium-sized nanorings c-P8, c-P10, and c-P12 give the expected
Job peaks at 0.20, 0.17, and 0.14 (c-P12), respectively, indicating that the stoichiometries
of their complexes are 1:4 (c-P8), 1:5 (c-P10), and 1:6
(c-P12). The largest nanoring
tested in this study, c-P30, gave a Job peak at 0.20 indicating formation of a 1:4 complex,
instead of the expected 1:15 complex. This surprising behavior may
be attributed to aggregation of the very large nanoring, either intermolecularly
or intramolecularly, to form a hairpin folded conformation.34

Time-Resolved Photoluminescence
Upon photoexcitation
of antennae in complexes of both natural3 and synthetic systems,35 energy transfer
occurs to the nanoring with almost 100% efficiency, suggesting ultrafast
quenching of the antenna emission resulting from energy transfer to
the nanoring acceptor.

We experimentally evaluate the energy-transfer
dynamics in complexes consisting of one porphyrin dimer (P2py2, fluorescence: E(Qx) = 1.68 eV) bound per porphyrin nanoring (c-PN, fluorescence: E(Qx) = 1.51–1.59 eV),
by monitoring the relative photoluminescence decay of the dimers,
as described in the Methods section. The complexes
were prepared at millimolar concentrations in toluene. The dimer was
also displaced from the complex by the addition of an excess of pyridine
(>1% v/v) to give a reference sample. Figure 2 shows the photoluminescence ratio of the
dimer between the assembled and disassembled states along with monoexponential
fits. The energy-transfer rate for each complex is given in Figure 2; strikingly, there
is no significant deviation from a (1.3 ps)−1 transfer
rate, as the nanoring size is varied between 6 and 30 porphyrin units.
A constant energy-transfer rate as a function of acceptor size is
unexpected in porphyrin nanoring systems, as the absorbing (initially
generated) lowest-lying excited state is thought to be highly delocalized
for most of the studied molecules.13 Such
delocalization introduces an increasing spatial separation between
the donor molecule and the “center-of-mass” of the exciton
generated on the acceptor nanoring, reducing the coupling in the Förster
resonance energy-transfer framework.

Figure 2 Ratio between the time-resolved dimer
photoluminescence in the
assembled and disassembled state isolating the dimer to nanoring energy-transfer
pathway is shown for the five nanoring sizes (circles; vertically
offset for clarity). A monoexponential fit (dashed line) is also shown,
with the time constant for each complex given. An excitation wavelength
of 627 nm was used.

The experimental result
suggests that there is a preferred acceptor
state that is essentially unchanging with nanoring size. Such constant
energy transfer could arise from coupling to a localized absorbing
state on the nanoring which would, however, have to be statically
correlated with the antenna position. Uncorrelated localization would
lead to a reduction in transfer rate with nanoring size, as a randomly
placed acceptor site would be further from the antenna (on average)
for larger rings. It is therefore proposed that the attachment of
an antenna dimer induces a localized acceptor state immediately below
the attachment point. The formation of this state is therefore most
likely directly related to the binding process itself.

Determination
of Binding Strain
We investigated the
thermodynamic stabilities of the c-PN·(P2py2)X complexes, as a function of ring-size,
to probe the flexibility of the nanorings and to study the role of
the noncovalent dimer-nanoring association on the acceptor state.
The binding constants of the complexes are too strong to determine
by direct formation titrations (Kf >
107 M–1). Thus, denaturation titrations
were
used to determine Kf indirectly, by quantifying
the ability of pyridine to break up the complexes, via the denaturation constant Kdn. At approximately
10–6 M in toluene at 25 °C, a large excess
of pyridine was titrated into the complexes of (c-PN)·(P2py2)N/2 (or (c-P6)·(P2py2)2 for N = 6) to displace the bidentate
ligand P2py2. The denaturation data were analyzed assuming
that each P2py2 binds independently to the nanoring,
with no allosteric cooperativity, using a 1:1 binding model, to give
the values of Kf listed in Table 1 (see Supporting Information for details).

Comparison of the binding constants
of the various nanorings with P2py2 reveals that Kf increases
as the nanoring becomes larger. The binding constant of c-P12 with P2py2 is close
to the affinity of the linear zinc porphyrin dimer P2 for P2py2 [(1.7 ± 0.3) × 108 M–1], implying that each segment of c-P12 behaves almost like a linear oligomer.
The strain energy, ΔGstrain, of
complex formation was estimated by comparing the stability of c-PN·P2py2 with that of the unstrained dimer complex P2·P2py2, using eq 3: 3  where ΔGbinding = −RT ln Kf. The results, plotted against ring size in Figure 3, show that ΔGstrain decreases with the size of the rings.

constants as a function of the number of the porphyrin units N. The blue line is a guide to the eye.

The strain in the nanorings, and the increase in strain caused
by binding P2py2, was analyzed using molecular mechanics
calculations. The geometries of all nanoring structures were calculated
using the MM+ force field in HyperChem (see Supporting Information). The decrease in curvature as the rings become
larger results in a change in distance between neighboring zinc centers;
the Zn–Zn distances are 12.1, 12.2, 12.4, and 12.5 Å for c-P6, c-P8, c-P10, and c-P12, respectively.
The structure of c-P12 is
the most flexible, and its calculated Zn–Zn distance is close
to that of the linear dimer P2 (12.8 Å). The finding
that only two P2py2 dimer antenna units bind to the zinc
porphyrin sites on c-P6 raises the question of whether the dimers sit close (1,3) or opposite
(1,4) to each other on the 6-ring. Models of these complexes from
molecular mechanics calculations (Figure 4) indicate that the geometry with the dimers
further apart (1,4) is lower in energy.

Modeling Energy Transfer
While the importance of structural
disorder on the energy-transfer dynamics in conjugated molecules is
well-known, the specific influence of a small change, such as introducing
an antenna molecule, is typically hard to assess. Here we present
a sensitive probe of how the exciton state on the nanoring is influenced
by associated structural changes that in turn impact on the energy
landscape. By combining ultrafast spectroscopy with associated modeling
we are able to link the observed energy dynamics with explicit models
representing fundamentally different acceptor states.

Any simulation
requires a description of both the spatial distribution and transition
energies and strengths of the donor and acceptor excitonic states.
While the donor emissive state is straightforward to characterize,
the acceptor state on the nanoring is more challenging to describe
for two key reasons. First, the far-field absorbing state of the smallest
nanorings is not expected to be the lowest-lying exciton state (known
as the k = 0 state) whose transition dipole is symmetry-forbidden.36 Therefore, electronic coupling is generally
assumed to occur through the far-field dipole allowed state (the k = 1 state) as measured using standard single-photon absorption.37 Second, the absorbing states of the free nanoring
may not necessarily be energetically identical to those of the bound
nanoring in the complex.15 We have previously
shown that complete delocalization of the lowest-lying excitonic state
can be observed for free nanoring molecules in solution, through both
conjugation effects (a redshift in absorption with increasing ring
size)13 and symmetry effects: a reduction
in radiative rate,16,38 thermally activated emission,27 and emission polarization anisotropy at early
times.13 For the complex studied, however,
two key observations suggest the existence of a localized absorbing
state on the region of the chain directly below the free-base dimer.
We have demonstrated that there is no significant change in energy-transfer
rate with nanoring size and that coupling to a donor dimer leads to
non-negligible strain on the nanoring, with a local planarization
and suppression of torsional motion.

To quantitatively assess
the influence of localization, strain,
and choice of absorbing states, we have calculated the energy-transfer
rates in this system as a function of ring size for the three different
models shown in Figure 5, as follows:(1) Model 1 takes the Förster point-dipole
approach, for which we assume an acceptor dipole to be situated at
the center of the nanoring and calculate the energy-transfer rate
using the traditional point-dipole model39

(2) Model 2 assumes a
fully delocalized
(k = 1) absorbing state on the nanoring, with the
energy transfer between dimer and nanoring evaluated using the line-dipole
model40

(3) Model 3 assumes an absorbing state
of extent Na porphyrin
units localized below the dimer. The energy-transfer rate is calculated
using the line-dipole approach.



Figure 5 (Top) Schematic of three
energy-transfer models for the dimer c-P8 system: (left) point-dipole
model, (center) line-dipole model with fully delocalized (k = 1) nanoring state, and (right) line-dipole model with
partially localized (Na = 6) acceptor state. Arrows indicate subdipole coupling elements.
(Lower) Modeled data for (top) coupling strength VDA, (center) spectral overlap IDA, and (bottom) energy-transfer rate kDA. The (1) point-dipole model is shown in blue, (2) line-dipole model
(to k = 1) in green, and (3) localized dimer model
in black. Experimental data are shown in red (bottom panel only).
The inset shows the dimer model and experimental data only. All lines
are guides to the eye.

For the line-dipole approach (Models 2 and 3), six subdipoles
per
porphyrin unit were used, chosen as providing coupling energies within
experimental error of the value obtained where the number of subdipoles
tends toward infinity.40,41 The models are described fully
in the Supporting Information, along with
details of input parameters, such as geometry and donor emission and
acceptor absorption characteristics.

For Model 3, the specific
nature of the localized absorbing state
requires particular consideration. The most localizing scenario of
a dimer-like absorbing state on the nanoring being formed below the
dimer does not appear to be representative of the distribution of
strain on the molecule (see Figure 4). In addition, such severe localization would lead
to the emergence of a clear dimer-like higher-energy transition in
the absorption or photoluminescence spectrum upon binding which is
not observed (see Supporting Information). Therefore, a weaker effect of partial localization of the absorbing
state over Na units of
the ring just below the donor dimer is considered. Here we use absorption
spectra for a range of complementary porphyrin oligomers on a suitable
template to compute energy-transfer rates that are then contrasted
with the experimental data (see Figures S23 and S24 of the Supporting Information). By use of the oligomer
as a model, we are thus able to simulate the effect of strain, torsional
restriction, and Zn-pyridyl coordination on the electronic state.42 We find that a description of the localized
distorted state extending over Na = 6 units offers best match between experimental data and
calculations for Model 3, suggesting that strain resulting from dimer
attachment weakens the effective conjugation of the absorption state
only to a certain extent.

The key outputs from our three models
are shown in Figure 5, namely the coupling strength VDA calculated
using Models 1–3, the spectral
overlap IDA for the full-nanoring (Models
1 and 2), and localized absorbing (Model 3) state, and the predicted
energy-transfer rate as a function of nanoring size. It can be seen
that Model 3 provides both a qualitative and quantitatively excellent
agreement with the experimental data, strongly supporting the emergence
of a localized state upon noncovalent binding of an antenna molecule.
In particular, Model 3 is the only approach that mirrors the observed
striking independence of energy-transfer rates on ring size.

The origin of the emergence of a localized state can be related
to two effects: first, the strain applied during binding, and second,
the local suppression of torsional motion. Deviation from circularity
is known to create localized states,16 while
backbone distortion in particular36 creates
low-energy sites. Torsional motion has often been implicated as a
key driver toward disorder and (de)localization in a number of conjugated
systems.43,44 These features are highly relevant, as in
the assembled dimer-nanoring complexes, the torsional angle between
the two bound porphyrins is locked, which often generates a higher
conjugation, lower-energy state,45 as experimentally
shown for cyclic oligothiophene molecules with planarizing linkers46 and porphyrin dimers.47,48 In addition to strain-induced localization effects, local coordination
with the pyridine groups of the dimer may lower the energetic landscape
of the porphyrin sites to which the dimer is coordinated.49 However, our energy-transfer model indicates
the existence of an absorbing state longer than two porphyrin units,
supporting a spatially extended cause such as strain.

It is
logical, therefore, that the noncovalent addition of an antenna
molecule onto a nanoring structure induces significant strain, resulting
in the distortion of the energetic environment and the emergence of
localized states. Such an indirect impact on the exciton states of
the nanoring originates from the flexibility of the nanoring systems
as well as the sensitivity of the molecule to environmental effects.
While environment-driven localization effects have been observed in
naturally occurring systems,25,50 the use of strain in
the synthetic nanoring systems described provides a tool to control
local exciton states in multichromophoric complexes.

Conclusion
In summary, we have revealed the fundamental mechanisms underlying
energy transfer in a family of synthetic porphyrin light-harvesting
complexes with analogies to the natural LH2 antenna systems. Our ability
to vary the ring size 5-fold between 6 and 30 porphyrin units has
enabled validity tests of energy-transfer models that are hard to
achieve for biological systems. We were able to explore the effect
of strain resulting from donor binding to the porphyrin nanorings via a study of binding affinities. Binding constants were
shown to increase significantly with the size of the ring, consistent
with host distortion and strain effects decreasing from the rigid
6-ring to the more flexible 12-ring. Our subsequent investigation
shows that such strain also has significant impact on the energy-transfer
rates in the assembled systems. Upon varying the size of the nanoring
from 6 to 30 porphyrin units, no change in energy-transfer rate between
the attached dimer and the nanoring was observed. These experimental
results indicate that the absorbing state is independent of nanoring
size, acting as a localized state centered below the antenna molecule.
Simulation of energy-transfer rates qualitatively and quantitatively
agrees with the existence of a localized acceptor state extending
over approximately six porphyrin units. Our findings therefore demonstrate
the critical role of both the mechanical and electronic effect of
strain in supramolecular systems exhibiting high degrees of exciton
delocalization. Our work also highlights an approach to exploit strain
in large conjugated materials, to create efficient, size-independent
synthetic energy funneling for light-harvesting applications.

Methods
Up-Conversion Spectroscopy
An ultrafast Ti:sapphire
laser operating at 820 nm provided 100 fs laser pulses at 80 MHz.
A fraction of this was used to pump an optical parametric oscillator
operating at 627 nm, to be used as an optical pump pulse. This wavelength
was chosen to preferentially excite the dimer in the complex with
respect to the nanoring absorption (see Supporting Information). Millimolar solutions with high absorbance were
studied to achieve optical excitation within a small volume of sample,
to minimize temporal smearing and maximize signal-to-noise ratio.
The power of pump pulse incident on the sample was set to be 10 mW
(∼0.25 μJ/cm2/pulse), with a vertical polarization,
which was focused onto the sample held inside a quartz cuvette. The
emitted photoluminescence was collected by a pair of off-axis parabolic
mirrors and focused onto a 1 mm thick nonlinear crystal (BBO) along
with the remainder of the (vertically polarized) laser pulse. The
up-converted signal was spatially and spectrally filtered to remove
the gate pulse and residual photoluminescence, before detection using
a spectrometer and liquid nitrogen cooled CCD. The system was set
to up-convert the photoluminescence signal from the dimer, centered
at 735 nm, and had a temporal resolution of approximately 270 fs as
measured by cross-correlation. By measuring the ratio of the photoluminescence
from the photoexcited dimer as a function of time after excitation
for the assembled and disassembled state of the complex (without and
with pyridine, respectively), a transfer rate can be determined. Complete
photoluminescence decay curves are shown in the Supporting Information.
