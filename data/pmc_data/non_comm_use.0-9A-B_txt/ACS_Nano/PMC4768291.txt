We
report the angular distribution of the G and 2D Raman scattering
from graphene on glass by detecting back focal plane patterns. The
G Raman emission can be described by a superposition of two incoherent
orthogonal point dipoles oriented in the graphene plane. Due to double
resonant Raman scattering, the 2D emission can be represented by the
sum of either three incoherent dipoles oriented 120° with respect
to each other, or two orthogonal incoherent ones with a 3:1 weight
ratio. Parameter-free calculations of the G and 2D intensities are
in excellent agreement with the experimental radiation patterns. We
show that the 2D polarization ratio and the 2D/G intensity ratio depend
on the numerical aperture of the microscope objective. This is due
to the depolarization of the emission and excitation light when graphene
is on a dielectric substrate, as well as to tight focusing. The polarization
contrast decreases substantially for increasing collection angle,
due to polarization mixing caused by the air-dielectric interface.
This also influences the intensity ratio I(2D)/I(G), a crucial quantity for estimating the doping in graphene.
Our results are thus important for the quantitative analysis of the
Raman intensities in confocal microscopy. In addition, they are relevant
for understanding the influence of signal enhancing plasmonic antenna
structures, which typically modify the sample’s radiation pattern.

==== Body
Graphene is a versatile building
block for a variety of applications, ranging from nanophotonics to
thin-film transistors and optoelectronics.1 Raman spectroscopy is one of the most used characterization techniques
in carbon science and technology.2 The
measurement of the Raman spectrum of graphene3 triggered a huge effort to understand phonons, electron–phonon,
magneto-phonon, and electron–electron interactions in graphene,
as well as the influence of the number and orientation of layers,
electric or magnetic fields, strain, doping, disorder, quality and
types of edges, and functional groups.4 The Raman spectrum of graphene and few layer graphene (FLG) consists
of two fundamentally different sets of peaks. Those, such as D, G,
2D, present also in single layer graphene (SLG), and due to in-plane
vibrations,2,5,6 and others,
such as the shear (C) modes7 and the layer
breathing modes (LBMs),8−11 due to relative motions of the planes themselves, either perpendicular
or parallel to their normal.

The G peak corresponds to the high
frequency E2g phonon
at Γ. The D peak is due
to the breathing modes of six-atom rings and requires a defect for
its activation.5,12−14 It comes from
TO phonons around the Brillouin Zone (BZ) edge K,5,12,13 is active by double resonance
(DR),14,15 and is strongly dispersive with excitation
energy due to a Kohn Anomaly (KA) at K.16 DR can also happen as intravalley process, that is, connecting
two points belonging to the same cone around K (or K′). This gives the so-called D′ peak. The 2D
peak is the D peak overtone. The 2D′ peak is the D′
overtone. Since 2D and 2D′ originate from a process where momentum
conservation is satisfied by two phonons with opposite wavevectors,
no defects are required for their activation, and are thus always
present.3,17 Note that, albeit being an in-plane mode,
the 2D peak is sensitive to the number of layers (N) since the resonant Raman mechanism that gives rise to it is closely
linked to the details of the band structure,3,4,6 the latter changing with N, and the layers relative orientation.18 On the other hand, the C and LBMs are a direct probe of N, since the vibrations themselves are out of plane, thus
directly sensitive to N.10,11

While most papers in literature deal with the spectrum of
Raman
scattered light, its angular distribution has not been considered
thus far, to the best of our knowledge. However, the angular distribution
of the emission carries important information on the nature of the
emissive state, such as its dipolar19 or
multipolar20 character, its polarization
state,21,22 its coupling to the environment,19,22 and its spatial coherence length.23 In
the case of antenna- or tip-enhanced near-field optical microscopy,24−26 the radiation pattern can be used to observe the antenna effect
and its directivity.24,27,28 From a practical perspective, the angular distribution of emission
determines the detection yield (ratio of detected to emitted light)
achieved in an optical measurement, thus being crucial for the quantitative
analysis of the observed emission intensities and polarization.

Here, we report the angular distribution of Raman scattering from
SLG on glass. This is detected in the back focal plane (BFP) of the
collecting microscope objective, giving rise to characteristic BFP
patterns. Comparison with analytical calculations shows that the G
emission can be represented by the sum of two incoherent orthogonal
point dipoles. The 2D band can be described by two mathematically
equivalent models. It can be represented as a sum of two incoherent
orthogonal point dipoles, with a 3:1 weighting ratio, as expected
from polarized Raman scattering.29,30 Alternatively,
it can be described as the sum of three incoherent dipoles rotated
in-plane by 120° with respect to each other, reflecting the threefold
symmetry of the DR around K and K′.29−31 The BFP data also show that the 2D polarization ratio depends on
the numerical aperture (NA) of the microscope objective, which also
influences the 2D/G intensity ratio for polarized detection. Our results
are thus important for the quantitative analysis of the Raman intensities
in confocal microscopy.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a
collection of experimental (Figure 1a, i–iv) and calculated (Figure 1a, v–viii) BFP images of the G peak,
with and without analyzer in the detection beam path. All patterns
are recorded for two orthogonal directions of the excitation polarization.
Due to the SLG symmetry properties, this should lead to the same results,
as discussed below, thus helping to exclude possible imaging artifacts.

Figure 1 (a) Experimental
and calculated G peak BFP images with and without
analyzer. The same scaling is used in each row for the experimental
and theoretical data. (b) Cross sections taken through the center
of the experimental and calculated BFP patterns in (a). The arrows
indicate the direction of polarization.

Without analyzer in the detection beam path, the pattern
features
a ring of uniform intensity (Figure 1a,i). As a test, the excitation polarization is rotated
by 90°, leading to an identical pattern (Figure 1a,ii). The strongest emission is seen for kx2/k02 + ky2/k02 ≥ 1, corresponding to angles exceeding the critical
angle of the glass-air interface θcrit = arcsin(nair/nglass), giving
NA = nglass sin θcrit = 1. This is expected due to the increased photon density of states
in this angular range and the connected enhancement of spontaneous
emission.32

For polarized detection,
two bright lobes in the direction orthogonal
to the detection polarization are seen (Figure 1a,iii). Rotating the analyzer by 90°
rotates the resulting pattern, retaining its intensity (Figure 1a,iv). Because the same intensity
is seen for parallel and perpendicular detection polarization, we
infer that the G band emission is isotropically polarized, consistent
with previous reports.29

The comparison
between the G peak experimental BFP patterns with
analyzer in Figure 1a,iii and iv with the calculated pattern of a point-dipole in Figure 6c indicates that
the G Raman scattering in SLG can be modeled by the superposition
of two incoherent and orthogonal in-plane point dipoles. This is confirmed
by the corresponding series of parameter-free calculated patterns
for the respective excitation and detection conditions, presented
in the lower row of Figure 1a,v–viii. The quantitative agreement between experimental
and theoretical emission distribution can also be seen from the comparison
of the corresponding cross sections in Figure 1b.

with and without
analyzer. The same scaling is used in each row for the experimental
and theoretical data. (b) Cross sections taken through the center
of the experimental and calculated BFP patterns in (a).

Figure 2a plots
the BFP patterns of the 2D band. Unlike those of the G band, they
do not exhibit radial symmetry, indicating polarized Raman scattering.
The patterns recorded for polarized detection (Figure 2a,iii and iv) also resemble a superposition
of two orthogonal dipoles, although with weaker intensity for the
cross-polarized case (Figure 2a,iv). The ratio of parallel to cross-polarized 2D intensities r2D = I(2D)∥/I(2D)⊥ was previously reported
to be ∼3.29,33 We thus calculate the BFP patterns
in Figure 2a,v–viii
as the incoherent sum of two orthogonal dipoles with r2D = 3. Both patterns and corresponding cross sections
(Figure 2b) are in
good agreement with experiments.

On the other hand, due to the
threefold symmetry of the DR Raman
process around K and K′, the 2D emission
can also be considered to result from three dipoles each rotated in-plane
by 120°, as discussed below. For linearly polarized light, the
excitation efficiency of the three dipoles scales with the angle δ
between the incident field E⃗ and the dipole
axis p⃗ as |p⃗·E⃗|2 ∼ cos2 (δ).
Without loss of generality, we consider one dipole to be parallel
to the laser polarization, and the other two rotated by 120°
and 240°, thus excited with a lower efficiency of cos2(120°) = cos2(240°) = 1/4. The BFP patterns calculated with three dipoles weighted 1:1/4:1/4 are in good agreement
with the experimental patterns as well as with results obtained by
the 2-dipole model.

Using group theory, the G Raman intensity
can be calculated as4,29,34,35 1  where R1 and R2 are the double degenerate E2g Raman polarizability tensors: 2  and êL and êS are the unit vectors of polarization
of incident and scattered light at the focus of the microscope objective.

Equation 1 can also
be understood as the sum of two orthogonal incoherent dipoles. The
dot products Ri·êS in eq 1 correspond to the oscillation direction of the two
orthogonal point dipoles, while the sum of the modulus square accounts
for an incoherent superposition. For NA > 1 and for samples on
an
air–dielectric interface, the polarization directions entering
in eq 1 do not correspond
to the polarization directions outside the focus, as noted above (see
also Figure 6c). Due
to its symmetry properties with |R1·êx| = |R2·êy|, the effect of polarization mixing cancels out in the case
of the G peak, but not for 2D. This polarization mixing, that becomes
visible for nglass sin θ
= NA > 1, thus influences the experimentally observed r2D as we will see in the following.

Figure 3 (a) Depolarization of
excitation pL and emission pS at the glass–air
interface as a function of the focusing angle θ expressed by
NA = n sin θ. (b) Experimental and calculated
2D intensity ratio for parallel and perpendicular polarized light r2D = I(2D)∥/I(2D)⊥. The curve is a plot of eq 6.

Depolarization occurs for both
excitation and emission light. For
excitation, it can be quantified by the ratio pL between the intensity component perpendicular to the polarization
of a strongly focused linearly polarized Gaussian laser beam I(L)⊥ and the parallel
one I(L)∥ as pL = I(L)⊥/ I(L)∥. This NA-dependent ratio can be calculated by integrating over the
electric fields at the glass–air interface in the focus of
the microscope objective up to the given NA.32,36 For emission, depolarization can be quantified by the ratio pS between the detected intensity for parallel I(S)∥ and perpendicular I(S)⊥ polarization with
respect to the emitting dipole (see also Figure 6c). These intensities can be calculated by
integrating the corresponding BFP patterns over an increasing angular
range.19 Both NA-dependent effects are
illustrated in Figure 3a, which shows that they become relevant for NA > 1. Depolarization
has a larger influence on the emission than on the excitation light.
With this information, eq 1 can be reformulated into a more general expression for both G and
2D: 3  with i = 1,2 and i = 1–3 in the case
of G and 2D, respectively, and j,k = ∥,⊥.

The depolarization matrices are developed
considering the depolarization
of the excitation and emission pL and pS (see Figure 3a): 4  with pS = I(S)⊥/I(S)∥ and pL = I(L)⊥/I(L)∥. For NA
< 1 the influence of the depolarization matrices can be neglected
and eq 3 simplifies to eq 1. We note that the Raman
polarization tensor of the totally symmetric 2D phonons does not result
in the polarization contrast ∼3 of refs.29,35 This derives
from the DR process14,15 and the interplay of photon–electron
and electron–phonon coupling.5,12−14 We need to consider intervalley scattering between K and K′ with six possible K–K′ and K′–K combinations.29 Due to symmetry, we can
limit the discussion to three K–K′ combinations.29 DR intervalley
scattering results in distinct electronic populations around the three
different K′ points neighboring the K point, each rotated by 120°.29 We
thus describe the 2D band as a sum of three incoherent dipoles corresponding
to the following three Raman tensors that directly reflect the symmetries
of the electronic populations caused by double resonant Raman scattering:   5  Tensors R2 and R3 are obtained
via rotation of R1 by 120° and 240°,
correcting the excitation
efficiency of the dipoles by the scaling ratio 1:= 1:. As a result, the 2D
intensity depends
on polarization, and is thus influenced by the depolarization of excitation
and emission, unlike the G peak. Because depolarization depends on
NA, r2D becomes NA-dependent as well.
Using eqs 3–5, we obtain 6  

Figure 3b compares
the ratio obtained from eq 6 with the experimental ones for increasing NA. Both experimental
and theoretical data show a substantial decrease of ∼30% towards
larger NA. Deviations of the experimental data from the predicted
curve are presumably due to the background correction for laser scattered
light for small collection angles and reduced objective transmittance
for large ones (see below Figure 5).22,37,38

Parallel polarized SLG Raman Spectra as a function of NA. All
spectra are normalized to I(G). (b) NA dependence

in the text.

The intensity ratio I(2D)/I(G)
is crucial to derive the doping of SLG.4,39−41 Doping also influences the defects determination via I(D)/I(G).42 Polarization
mixing caused by the air-glass interface with different effects on I(2D) and I(G) would thus change I(2D)/I(G). The NA dependence of I(2D)/I(G) is illustrated in Figure 4a. We can express I(2D)/I(G) using the NA-dependent r2D: 7   8   9   10   11  with ρ being
the unpolarized ratio and
ρp (ρcp) the polarized ratio for
parallel (perpendicular) polarization, where the analyzer is parallel
(perpendicular) to the excitation polarization. For ρp, the ratio is larger than for nonpolarized detection because the
G peak is isotropic and the 2D peak is partly polarized along the
polarization of the excitation laser. Whereas for ρcp the ratio is smaller than for nonpolarized detection (see also Figure 4b). The slightly
higher 2D signal for NA = 1.3 compared to that for NA = 1.2 in Figure 4a is consistent with
the ratio determined from the experimental BFP patterns r2D, that is seen to slowly increase for NA > 1.2 (Figure 3b).

Using the
representation of SLG Raman emission as the sum of two
incoherent dipoles we can now calculate the fraction of light detected
in an experiment, γ (see Figure 5). This depends
on the collection angle:24 12  where Ptotal is
the total emitted power distributed over the upper halfspace, Puhs, and the lower halfspace, Plhs. In our configuration, the upper halfspace is air
and the lower is the glass substrate. γ(NA), measured by collecting
the light through the glass using an index matched objective, can
be calculated by integrating the theoretical BFP patterns from 0 to
NA, followed by normalization of the patterns integrated over 4π
(Figure 5). Integration
of the experimental G and 2D BFP patterns results in very similar
NA dependencies up to NA = 1.2. In Figure 5, the experimental curves are normalized
to the theoretical value at NA = 1, accounting for the known lower
transmission of the marginal rays for larger NA.22,37,38

The radiation patterns presented above
together with the NA dependent
detection yield for SLG on glass shown in Figure 5, provide a complete quantitative description
of the polarized Raman signals detected in a microscope configuration.
In addition, this description will also be important for the discussion
of the signal enhancement provided by plasmonic nanostructures placed
in the vicinity of SLG. Because plasmonic nanostructures act as optical
antennas and are typically connected to an angular redistribution
of emission, quantification of the achieved Raman enhancement requires
the exact knowledge of the spatial distribution of emission and of
the NA dependent fraction of detected light.20,24−26

Figure 5 Experimental and calculated fraction of detected light
as a function
of NA. The experimental curves are normalized to the theoretical value
at NA = 1.

Because the excitation field is
coherent within the focal area,
the modulus square in eq 6 would need to include the spatial integral of the induced Raman
polarization in case of fully coherent scattering. In general, spatially
coherent Raman scattering could influence the observed far-field radiation
patterns if the coherence length is ∼λ/4, in which case
retardation effects start playing a role.34,35 Since all our experimentally recorded BFP patterns can be quantitatively
described using point dipoles located at the same position, the coherence
length is expected to be substantially smaller.34,35 Reference (35) reported
that spatially coherent Raman scattering influences the near-field
optical response with coherence length ∼30 nm. Since this length
is <λ/4, our treatment of SLG Raman scattering as spatially
incoherent is justified.

Finally, we address the expected effect
of depolarization on the
D peak. In case of pointlike defects, the D band Raman scattering
will behave similarly to the 2D one, because it has nearly the same
directional preference for electron–phonon interaction as that
of the intervalley resonant Raman process of the 2D band.49,50 We thus expect I(D)/I(G) to have
the same depolarization as I(2D)/I(G) for a given NA. For linearly extended defects that are localized
in one dimension of the momentum space, such as edges, polarized Raman
scattering can be observed.28,43,44 In this case, the D peak intervalley process can occur for armchair
edges only when the incident polarization is parallel to the edge.
As a result, polarized Raman scattering will occur with an expected
contrast of 100%, for perfect edges.44 Here,
both depolarization of excitation and emission would reduce the observed
contrast, in case of high NA. As an estimate we can use the sum of
the two effects shown in Figure 3, deriving a maximum polarization contrast of about
(100 – 13 – 2) % = 85% for NA = 1.4, for perfect edges.

Conclusions
We investigated the angular distribution of the G and 2D Raman
scattering from graphene on glass by detecting back focal plane patterns.
The G Raman emission can be described by a superposition of two incoherent
orthogonal point dipoles oriented in the graphene plane. Due to double
resonant Raman scattering, the 2D emission can be represented by the
sum of either three incoherent dipoles oriented 120° with respect
to each other, or two orthogonal incoherent ones with a 3:1 weight
ratio. While the G scattering is confirmed to be nonpolarized, we
observe polarized scattering in case of the 2D band. The polarization
contrast decreases substantially for increasing collection angle,
due to polarization mixing caused by the air-dielectric interface.
This also influences I(2D)/I(G),
a crucial quantity for estimating the doping in graphene. We expect
our treatment of the depolarization and the corresponding expression
derived for calculating the polarized Raman scattering intensities
in eq 4 to be applicable
to a wide range of samples including other layered materials, nanotubes,
or nanowires. Our results are thus important for the quantitative
analysis of the Raman intensities in confocal microscopy with high
numerical aperture.

Methods
Sample Preparation
Graphene layers are deposited by
micromechanical cleavage45 on Si wafers
covered with 300 nm of SiO2. SLGs are identified by a combination
of optical microscopy46 and Raman spectroscopy
[Renishaw inVia at 514, 633 nm].3,4 SLGs are transferred
onto glass by a polymer-based wet transfer process.47 PMMA (molecular weight 950 K) is spin coated onto the substrate
where graphite flakes are exfoliated, then the sample is immersed
in deionized water, resulting in the detachment of the polymer film
due to water intercalation at the PMMA–SiO2 interface.47,48 The flakes attach to the polymer and can be removed from the Si/SiO2 substrate. The polymer+graphene film is then placed onto
the glass substrate and, after complete drying of the water, PMMA
is removed by acetone. Success of the transfer is confirmed both optically
and by Raman spectroscopy. No significant D peak is detected after
transfer, showing that the process does not result in structural defects.

Microscope Setup
The experimental setup for real space
and back focal plane (BFP) imaging is shown in Figure 6a. Laser excitation
at 633 nm is provided by a linearly polarized HeNe laser. A 60×
oil immersion objective with NA = 1.4 is used to focus the laser beam
onto the sample and to collect the emitted light in backscattering
geometry. Narrow band-pass filters (10 nm spectral window) centered
at 700 and 760 nm are used to spectrally select the G and 2D signals,
respectively. The transmitted Raman signal is then detected by an
avalanche photodiode (APD). All polarized intensity data are also
corrected for the polarization sensitive transmission of the beam
splitter and the other optical elements in the beam path. A charged
coupled device (CCD) camera is positioned in the focus of the collimating
lens in the detection beam path. A flip mirror allows switching between
real space and BFP imaging.

an in-plane point dipole on an air–glass interface oriented
with Φ = 0° recorded for parallel (Φ = 0°, α
= 0° and Φ = 90°, α = 90°) and crossed
polarization (Φ = 0°, α = 90° and Φ =
90°, α = 0°), with α the orientation of the
analyzer transmission (detection polarization). The emission detected
for cross-polarization is due to polarization mixing caused by the
air–glass interface.

Back Focal Plane Imaging
BFP imaging is a Fourier technique
providing data in reciprocal space (Figure 6b). The BFP patterns are scaled by the normalized
wavevector components kx/k0 and ky/k0 where k0 = 2π/λ. The area of signal detection is
limited by NA as kx2/k02 + ky2/k02 ≤ NA2 = 1.42.

A confocal pinhole with 300 μm diameter is placed
on the focus of the tube lens (ft = 200
mm) in order to suppress background light generated out of focus originating
from inelastic scattering in the glass substrate, the immersion oil
and the microscope objective. Since such a pinhole restricts the detected
real space area, it is connected to a broadening in Fourier space.
Specifically, multiplication by a circular aperture function in real
space with radius raperture will translate
into convolution of the signal intensity by [sin(kraperture)/kraperture]2 in k-space, leading to a broadening of the
patterns and reduced resolution. As a compromise, a large pinhole
with 300 μm diameter is used, substantially exceeding the Airy
disk diameter =1.221λ/NA = 36.6 μm at the 700 nm Raman
emission wavelength (39.7 μm at 760 nm). All calculated BFP
patterns are convoluted with the corresponding function to consider
the effect of the confocal pinhole.

The intensity distributions I(kx/k0,ky/k0) in the back focal plane are calculated
using the p- and s-polarized components
of the electric fields
radiated by a point dipole p⃗ on the air-glass
interface, depending on its in-plane orientation Φ, the azimuthal
and polar emission angles θ and ϕ, and the distance from
the center r (see Figure 6b):19 13  The emission
pattern of a point-dipole oriented
in the sample plane has a distinct form (Figure 6c). On the borders of the circle, the pattern
has two half-moon shaped maxima on opposite sides.19 The line connecting the maxima is perpendicular to the
real space orientation of the radiating dipole p⃗. Therefore, the orientation of the dipole can be determined from
the orientation of the two maxima.19 The
emission detected for cross-polarization (analyzer transmission for
α = 90° with dipole orientation Φ = 0°) is due
to polarization mixing caused by the air-glass interface (Figure 6c).32

The corresponding depolarization effect occurs also
for the excitation
polarization. Tight focusing (θ > θcrit)
of
a linearly polarized laser beam at an air–dielectric interface
generates substantial intensity contributions in the two directions
perpendicular to the polarization of the unfocused laser light.32 Polarization mixing of both excitation and emission
light is considered in the calculations of the BFP pattern and of
the resulting polarization and intensity ratios.
