The
function of bioenergetic membranes is strongly influenced by
the spatial arrangement of their constituent membrane proteins. Atomic
force microscopy (AFM) can be used to probe protein organization at
high resolution, allowing individual proteins to be identified. However,
previous AFM studies of biological membranes have typically required
that curved membranes are ruptured and flattened during sample preparation,
with the possibility of disruption of the native protein arrangement
or loss of proteins. Imaging native, curved membranes requires minimal
tip–sample interaction in both lateral and vertical directions.
Here, long-range tip–sample interactions are reduced by optimizing
the imaging buffer. Tapping mode AFM with high-resonance-frequency
small and soft cantilevers, in combination with a high-speed AFM,
reduces the forces due to feedback error and enables application of
an average imaging force of tens of piconewtons. Using this approach,
we have imaged the membrane organization of intact vesicular bacterial
photosynthetic “organelles”, chromatophores. Despite
the highly curved nature of the chromatophore membrane and lack of
direct support, the resolution was sufficient to identify the photosystem
complexes and quantify their arrangement in the native state. Successive
imaging showed the proteins remain surprisingly static, with minimal
rotation or translation over several-minute time scales. High-order
assemblies of RC-LH1-PufX complexes are observed, and intact ATPases
are successfully imaged. The methods developed here are likely to
be applicable to a broad range of protein-rich vesicles or curved
membrane systems, which are an almost ubiquitous feature of native
organelles.

==== Body
Many biological
systems involve
multiple membrane proteins that interact with each other in ways that
are strongly influenced by the manner in which the proteins are organized
within the membrane. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can allow individual
proteins to be identified by their tertiary and quaternary structure,
so the arrangement of proteins can be studied.1 However, to date AFM has largely been applied to highly ordered
or model systems and always when the proteins are immobilized through
proximity to a supporting substrate, as otherwise the intrusion of
the AFM tip leads to motion of the protein or membrane and hence disruption
of the image. This has left the elucidation of the native architecture
of most membrane systems inaccessible to direct interrogation through
AFM imaging.

Here we focus on a relatively well studied membrane
protein system
but one that is particularly challenging with regard to membrane curvature.
Photosynthetically grown cells of the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides elaborate an extensive intracytoplasmic
membrane system comprising spherical vesicles (“chromatophores”)
that exist both singly and in budded structures,2,3 with
an average diameter around 50 nm. The number of chromatophore vesicles
per cell varies between ∼250 and 1500, with more membrane vesicles
required at low light intensities.4 In
each chromatophore, the light energy is absorbed by light-harvesting
2 (LH2) complexes and transferred to reaction center–light
harvesting 1–PufX (RC-LH1-PufX) complexes (core complexes).5 In the core complex, excitation energy is converted
to a charge separation and then to a quinol, which ferries electrons
and protons through the lipid bilayer to the dimeric cytochrome bc1 (cytbc1) complex.
This process requires proximity between the RC-LH1-PufX and cytbc1 complexes and a lipid- and quinone-enriched
environment, both of which were observed previously.6 Turnover at the cytbc1 complex
generates a proton motive force that drives the ATP synthase (ATPase)
to convert ADP to ATP.7

AFM has previously
been used to image the arrangement of LH2, RC-LH1-PufX,
and cytbc1 complexes. Detergents have
been used to open the vesicles to form flattened membranes, potentially
giving a non-native organization.4,6 Low force contact
mode imaging has been used to observe the native organization of the
part of the chromatophore adjacent to a solid support on which it
was immobilized.2 The information from
AFM images,6 together with the X-ray crystallographic
structures of the complexes8 and their
membrane stoichiometries determined by mass spectrometry,6 has enabled the construction of an atomic-level
model of an entire chromatophore vesicle.6,9 This
1.9 million-atom model, which comprises 67 LH2 complexes, 11 RC-LH1-PufX
dimers, 2 RC-LH1-PufX monomers, 4 cytbc1 dimers, and 2 ATP synthases, allows computation of energy, electron,
and proton transfers on time scales from femtoseconds to seconds6,10 and shows how the photosystem architecture of the chromatophore
is optimized for bacterial growth at low light intensities.

The vesicle model was compiled from AFM topographs of flattened
membrane patches, but it is known that some of the proteins in the
chromatophore provide an intrinsic curvature,8 so it is desirable to image these membrane vesicles directly in
their native, curved state. There remains a significant challenge
to overcome the large topography and lack of a supporting substrate
in close proximity to the membrane while maintaining sufficient resolution
to obtain information on protein organization. It is common for biological
membranes to exhibit curvature, so addressing this challenge will
have many potential applications.

In order to image the top
surface of a chromatophore, it is necessary
to reduce the forces applied between the tip and sample. Here, we
have utilized gentle tapping mode AFM with optimized imaging conditions
to study the membrane organization of chromatophores from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and have quantified the distribution
of the photosystem complexes within them. We also image ATPases in
their native chromatophores and see high-order assemblies of RC-LH1-PufX
complexes.

Results and Discussion
To image the surface of the
curved vesicular chromatophore with
high resolution, the tip–sample interaction must be minimized
in both lateral and normal directions. To this end, the microscope
was operated in tapping mode to minimize lateral forces due to the
scanning motion.11,12 Small cantilevers were used,
as these have been shown to give faster feedback response and lower
thermal noise in a given bandwidth13 (see Supporting Information Section 1, Supplementary Figure 1) and have previously been
utilized for high-resolution imaging14 and
force spectroscopy.15 The reduction of
thermal noise facilitates the use of relatively small tapping amplitudes
(approximately 1 nm) (see Supporting Information Section 2), giving low forces while maintaining signal-to-noise
ratio. We adjusted the salt concentration of the imaging buffer to
screen long-range electrostatic double-layer forces.16 This allows the tip to access short-range interactions
that carry high-resolution information while maintaining low net tip–sample
forces (tens of piconewtons) (Figure 1a,b).

Figure 1 Tapping mode (TM) force curves suggest reduction of long-range
interaction forces with increasing salt concentration. (a and b) Representative
TM force curves that plot amplitude (a) and TM deflection force (a
measure of the average tip–sample force) (b) vs distance, over a chromatophore surface in different salt concentration
imaging buffers and using the same tip. In (a) fitting the decline
of the amplitude with distance with an exponential gives decay lengths
of 1.82, 1.43, and 1.01 nm for 50, 150, and 300 mM KCl, respectively.
The shorter decay length at higher salt buffer suggests reduction
of long-range forces. (b) Under the conditions used (300 mM KCl, yellow
curve) and at the distance when amplitude reaches 90% of the free
amplitude, the TM deflection force is ∼20 pN (note that the
peak applied force will be significantly higher, as the average is
taken over multiple full oscillation cycles and assumes the feedback
is working perfectly). Using the relation in the Supporting Information Section 1,17,18 with k = 0.21 N/m, Q = 2.1, and
amplitude values from (a), the approximate tip–sample force
is 25 pN (note both that this relationship is approximate and that Q decreases closer to a surface, and this will increase
the calculated force).

Use of a small-cantilever high-speed AFM at relatively low
scan
speed minimized forces due to feedback error, crucial for imaging
the highly topographic vesicles (see Methods). Using this approach we were able to repeatedly image multiple
chromatophores with sufficient resolution to distinguish individual
proteins (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Example high-resolution AFM images of chromatophore vesicles in
their native state. (a–c) 3D representations of topographic
AFM images of the chromatophore vesicles; (d–f) corresponding
high-pass-filtered images (see Supporting Information Section 3). The larger ring (white arrow in (d)) is the LH1 complex
that surrounds the RC (the higher feature in the center), and together
they form the core RC-LH1-PufX complex. The smaller rings (black arrow
in (d)) are LH2 complexes, which surround the core complex and cover
most of the vesicle surface. The 3D images were low pass filtered
to remove the line noise and are displayed with an xy:z aspect ratio of 1. Black to white for (a), (b),
and (c) is 50, 45, and 50 nm, respectively. Scale bars are shown in
the high-pass-filtered image and represent 20 nm. The images were
taken in 300 mM KCl/20 mM MOPS, pH 7.4.

AFM imaging of chromatophores immobilized on mica shows that
the
majority of the membrane structures were vesicular, and of the 168
such vesicles imaged the most common values for height/width clustered
around 50/60 nm with a volume-conserving diameter of about 60 nm4 (Supplementary Figure 2; see also Supplementary Figure 3). The
slight deviation from a spherical shape might be an immobilization
effect. Budded vesicles, as imaged in tomographic sections of Rba. cells,3 or a connected reticulum,
as proposed by Scheuring etal.,2 were not seen. Cell disruption could be expected
to sever interconnections between vesicles, and surviving connections
could account for the fused, enlarged, and other shapes that were
sometimes observed (Supplementary Figure 4).

The uppermost surface of the chromatophore vesicle is supported
only by the fluid within the vesicle and by the mechanical properties
of the protein-rich membrane bilayer; yet there is sufficient stability
to maintain high resolution even in the center of the vesicle approximately
50 nm above the mica support (Supplementary Figure 2), at least for the 1–2 min required to obtain an image.
Indeed, successive imaging of the same chromatophore gave almost identical
images over time periods of multiple minutes (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 5), and defective protein complexes with missing subunits (arrowed, Figure 3c) remain in the
same place and with the same orientation, implying at most very limited
translational and rotational freedom. The high protein density in
this system might be the reason for this high positional and mechanical
stability, which has helped in imaging a statistically significant
number of chromatophores.

Figure 3 Photosystem complexes are translationally and
rotationally static.

image of the same vesicle as (a), taken 113 s later. (c) Composite
RGB image showing the overlay of (a) and (b), presented in different
color bands. In (c), the intensity of image (a) is scaled in green
(G), while the intensity of image (b) is scaled in magenta (red (R)
and blue (B) bands). In regions where the intensities/heights in both
images are the same, intensity values of R, G, and B bands are the
same and the pixels are gray, while regions where the intensities/heights
are higher in the first image or the second image are closer to green
or magenta, respectively (RGB value for green is [0 255 0], while
that for magenta is [255 0 255]). Most of the pixels on top of the
chromatophore are gray, suggesting the proteins are translationally
static with respect to each other. The white arrow points to a defect
that remains at the same position, suggesting lack of rotational motion.
The black arrow shows the position where a defect is created by the
removal of a subunit from an LH2 complex between successive scans
and hence appears green. Scale bar in (a) represents 20 nm.

Using the same approach as above,
reconstituted flat LH2 membranes
immobilized on a mica substrate were imaged. Figure 4c–e show one such membrane patch where
the nine individual subunits of LH2 can be discerned. It is typically
much more challenging to resolve the individual subunits of the LH2
complexes on the surface of the chromatophore; however, in rare cases
the subunits could be observed. The calculation of the arc length
per subunit for an LH2 ring where three of the subunits are faintly
visible (Figure 4a,b)
suggests that LH2 rings are nonameric in native chromatophores as
in reconstituted 2D crystals (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Number of subunits in LH2 rings in native chromatophores.
In the
case of chromatophores, it is difficult to resolve individual subunits
((a) and (b)), while in case of 2D crystals the nine subunits of the
LH2 complex are discernible ((c), (d), and (e)). An exception is seen
in (a), where the three subunits of an LH2 ring can be seen (indicated
by black arrows). To estimate the number of subunits, the arc length
(red dashed) of the three subunits and the circumference of the whole
LH2 ring (blue dashed) was calculated (shown in (b)). The arc length
represents twice the distance between consecutive subunits, so the
ratio of the circumference to the arc length when multiplied by 2
should give the number of subunits. In (b) this number was ∼8.6,
which is close to 9. So the number of subunits in native chromatophores
seems to be 9, as seen in flattened membranes. Similar calculations
on an LH2 complex from a 2D crystal, red arrows in (c), gave the number
of subunits to be ∼8.3 (see (d)). (b) and (d) show a zoomed-in
view of (a) and (c), respectively. (e) shows a high pixel density
scan of the 2D crystal in (c), and the nine subunits are discernible.
(a) and (c) have the same scale, and the scale bar in (a) represents
20 nm. (b), (d), and (e) have the same scale, and the scale bar in
(b) represents 5 nm. Black to white for (c) and (d) is 4 nm, while
that for (e) is 2.5 nm.

In a chromatophore vesicle, the core complex may be identified
as a higher protrusion (RC) surrounded by LH1 either in a closed ring
(isolated RCs) or in an “S” shape (RC dimers). The RC-LH1-PufX
complex, with a diameter of ∼12 nm, is larger than LH2 rings,
which have a diameter of ∼8 nm and are composed of nine subunits
(Figures 2, 4, 5a,b). The surfaces of
the chromatophores are mostly covered by the core complexes and LH2
rings. For efficient excitation transfer between them, LH2 rings should
form a closely connected network leading to the core complex and the
core complexes should be well dispersed.19 We use the distribution of the distances between the centers of
RC-LH1-PufX and LH2 to quantify their organization in native chromatophores
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 Spatial distribution
of protein complexes in chromatophore vesicles.
(a) Height image, which, when high-pass-filtered (see Supporting Information Section 3 for details),
gives (b). In (b) the centers of LH2s (green *) and RCs (red ×)
are manually annotated and the distances between the centers were
computed (see Supporting Information Section
3 for details). The inset in (a) and (b) shows a profile between the
RCs of the chromatophore along the line shown in blue, and the path
length of the fit along the curved membrane is used as a distance
between the end points. Similarly, distances between the centers of
LH2s and RCs were calculated from AFM images of ∼180 chromatophore
vesicles and combined to plot the distributions in (c), (d), and (e).
The distribution of distances between any two centers of LH2 rings
(LH2–LH2 distances) is shown in (c). The first three peaks
at 8.9 ± 1.0, 16.5 ± 1.3, and 23.5 ± 1.4 nm suggest
approximately hexagonal arrangements of the LH2 rings and an effective
diameter for LH2 of 8.9 nm. The distribution of distances between
any two centers of core complexes or RCs (RC–RC distances)
is shown in (d). The first peak at 10.6 ± 0.8 nm corresponds
to the distances between RCs in an S-shaped RC dimer, while the peak
around 14.4 ± 0.8 nm represents the effective diameter of the
core complex. The distribution of distances between centers of LH2
rings and RCs (LH2–RC distances) is shown in (e). The first
peak at 11.7 ± 1.2 nm shows the most probable distance for the
nearest LH2 ring from the RC and is equal to the sum of the radii
of LH2 rings (diameter ∼8.9 nm) and core complexes (diameter
∼14.4 nm) shown above. Scale bar in (a) represents 20 nm. Black
to white in (a) is 40 nm. A threshold method was used to select the
distances within a peak, and the mean of these values was taken as
the center, while the errors are respective standard deviations. For
(c) and (e) the values in the center bin of the peaks and the two
bins on either side were used. For (d) since the first two peaks were
close, the values in the center bin and one bin on either side were
used.

The distribution of distances
shows the closest distance between
LH2 ring centers is 8.9 ± 1.0 nm (Figure 5c), longer than that for reconstituted LH2
2D crystals (8.0 ± 0.7 nm, Supplementary Figure 6) due to significantly different packing in chromatophores.
The peaks at 8.9 ± 1.0, 16.5 ± 1.3, and 23.5 ± 1.4
nm suggest a close to hexagonal packing of the LH2s, which may be
clearly discerned by eye in LH2-dense regions (Figure 6a,b), assuring maximum coverage of the surface
with LH2 antenna proteins and hence maximizing light absorption. Figure 6b shows a region
with LH2 rings surrounded by areas of “empty” lipid
in addition to other LH2 rings. These “empty” membrane
regions are perhaps created due to mixing of rings of different radii,
such as LH2 rings and core complexes,20 and/or to accommodate the curvature induced by the vesicular shape
of the chromatophore.21 These lipid regions
might provide a lipid path between the core complexes and cytbc1 dimers,6,22 adjacent to the core
complexes,6 to facilitate rapid electron
transfer via quinone diffusion. The crystal structure
of the cytbc1 complex23 indicates that it barely protrudes above the lipid bilayer
on the external surface of the chromatophore, does not form any easily
distinguishable structure, and may be located in “empty”
membrane regions. In this study, the size and shape of cytbc1 might be the reason for the difficulty in
assigning any feature or low-lying “empty” membrane
region to cytbc1, and alternative methods
that do not rely on topography are required to confirm its location.

and core complexes. (a) Hexagonal packing of LH2 rings (green *).
Also in (a), there are three rows of LH2 rings between two core complexes
(red ×). (b) LH2-rich region where there are some “empty
lipid” regions (yellow dots). “Empty lipid” regions
1 and 2 are surrounded by five LH2 rings, while “empty lipid”
region 3 is surrounded by six LH2 rings. LH2 ring 1 is surrounded
by seven LH2 rings, LH2 rings 2, 3, and 4 are surrounded by five rings
and an “empty lipid” region, while LH2 ring 5 is surrounded
by four rings and two “empty lipid” regions. (c and
d) Two monomer core complexes (red dotted circle) surrounded by LH2
rings. In (c) the core is surrounded by seven LH2 rings and “empty
lipid” regions, while in (d) the core is surrounded by eight
LH2 rings. (e and f) Two core complex dimers. In (e) the dimer is
surrounded by LH2 rings and “empty lipid” regions, and
by symmetry it can be said that 10 LH2 rings and “empty lipid”
regions surround a core dimer. Also, (e) shows that each core of an
S-dimer can be in contact with up to six LH2 rings. In (f) the dimer
is surrounded by LH2 rings, “empty lipid” regions, and
another core dimer. (g) Linear arrangement of five core complexes,
and each core is in contact with at least four LH2 rings. (h) Alternate
rows of core dimers and LH2 rings. (i) Seven core complexes in two
rows next to each other with each core complex in contact with at
least two LH2 rings. Some core complexes have a lower protrusion in
the center, suggesting decapitation of parts of the RC complex, possibly
due to the imaging force.

The distance between the centers of the core complexes within
a
dimer is given by the first peak of the RC–RC distance distribution
at ∼10.6 ± 0.8 nm (Figure 5d), which corresponds to the distance between RC-H
subunits. This figure is in good agreement with the distance measured
from the 3D structure of the RC-LH1-PufX dimer8,24 but
larger than found in AFM studies (7.8–8.8 nm3).
This difference arises from flattening of the membrane on the mica
substrate in previous studies, which distorts the “V”
shape of the RC-LH1-PufX dimer and brings the RC-H subunits approximately
2 nm closer together, as discussed in Tucker etal.3 The present work shows that
the angle between the two halves of the dimer apparent in structural
studies of the purified complex does reflect the natural shape of
the complex in the intact chromatophore vesicle (Supplementary Figure 7). The second peak at 14.4 ± 1.0
nm gives the distance between the centers of two monomer core complexes
and is larger than the 12.1–12.4 nm RC–RC distance found
for adjacent monomeric RC-LH1 and RC-LH1-PufX complexes in topographs
of Rba. sphaeroides membranes.25,26 The 14.4 nm separation indicates that the RC-LH1-PufX monomers do
not always pack closely together. In addition to core-complex monomers
and dimers, higher order organization of the core complexes was observed
(Figure 6), and the
number of LH2 rings in direct contact with the core complex ranged
from eight to two complexes and might affect the light harvesting/charge
separation efficiency.27,28 This ordering of core complexes
varies, and in addition to the linear arrays of core complexes, seen
in Figure 6g and i,
we also see rows of core dimers separated by LH2 rings (Figure 6h), as observed previously.29 We also notice that the arrangement of the core
complexes in Rba. sphaeroides differs from that of Rhodospirillum photometricum.(22)

Quantitative mass spectrometry has shown that, on average,
chromatophore
vesicles have two ATPases, which is more than sufficient to efficiently
convert the light energy to ATP.6 Since
an ATPase requires only a proton gradient to perform its function,
its location is expected to be independent of the arrangement of other
proteins. An intact ATPase protrudes approximately 14 nm from the
chromatophore lipid surface,30 significantly
higher than any of the other proteins in the membrane. Due to its
large topography and fragile nature, it was not possible to consistently
image the ATPase, preventing its unambiguous localization relative
to other proteins in the chromatophore. However, from the few intact
or partly decapitated ATPases we were able to image (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 8), no clear preference for proximity to either the
core complex or the LH2 rings was observed. We find the height to
be about 12 nm relative to the protein-rich background. This height
is close to the expected height of 14 nm calculated above the lipid
bilayer. The heights measured above the membrane are likely to be
slightly underestimated, as they are measured from the LH2-rich protein
background where LH2s are approximately 2 nm above the lipid bilayer
(Supplementary Figure 9).

deviation of the residuals of the fit to the lipid background. Scale
bars in (b) and (c) represent 20 nm. Black to white in (c) is 37 nm.

Conclusion
In the work presented
here, we have applied small cantilever tapping
mode AFM with optimized scanning parameters and buffer conditions
to native chromatophore vesicles prepared from photosynthetically
grown cells of Rba. sphaeroides. The robust approach
developed gives sufficiently high resolution to allow proteins to
be identified by their tertiary and quaternary structure, enabling
the native organization of the proteins in a largely undeformed organelle
to be studied. We find that the proteins in the chromatophores are
both translationally and rotationally static. Nonameric LH2 complexes
are, on average, packed in a hexagonal lattice, while the core complexes
are present as monomers, dimers, and higher order structures. We also
image ATPases in the whole chromatophore and provide the most complete
image of the chromatophore vesicles of Rba. to date,
which complement the atomic-level modeling of chromatophore structure.6 We have used a commercially available AFM and
cantilevers, and the methods developed here are likely to be applicable
to a broad range of highly curved membrane systems. These are an almost
ubiquitous feature of native organelles, including protein-rich vesicles
and mitochondria,31 and of artificial proteoliposomes
used for nanobiotechnology applications.32 The procedure can also be used to obtain high-resolution images
of live bacterial cell surfaces33 and native
peptidoglycans.

Methods
Chromatophore
vesicles were purified as previously reported.6 A mutant with cytbc1 labeled with YFP
was introduced using the vector pK18mobsacB (ATCC
87097). Single colonies of Rba. sphaeroides strains
were inoculated into 10 mL of M22+ medium and grown for 48 h at 34
°C in the dark with shaking. Further subculturing was used for
growth under photosynthetic conditions in volumes up to 20 L. Cells
harvested from a 2.5 L culture were resuspended in 30 mL of membrane
buffer (600 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic
acid (MOPS) pH 7), a few grains of DNase I and lysozyme were added
to the suspension, and the cells were then disrupted in a French pressure
cell at 18 000 psi; two cycles of French pressing were used
to ensure that the majority of cells were disrupted. The lysate was
centrifuged at 32 000 g for 25 min, and the supernatant layered
onto a discontinuous 15/40% (w/w) sucrose density gradient and centrifuged
in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 27 000 rpm (53000g) for 10 h. The chromatophore band, present just above the 15/40%
interface, was collected with a micropipet, then stored at 4 °C
overnight or frozen at −20 °C until required. The chromatophores
were diluted 100 times in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, and 10 μL of this
diluted sample was added to 50 μL of immobilization buffer (25
mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, and 20 mM MOPS pH 7.4) followed by
deposition on freshly cleaved mica (Agar Scientific). The immobilization
buffer completely screened the electrostatic double-layer repulsive
forces and provides a net attractive force34 between the chromatophore and mica surfaces. An incubation of approximately
30 min at room temperature and washing five times with 100 μL
of imaging buffer gave a good surface coverage in tapping mode topographs
(Supplementary Figure 3) and was used for
all the experiments. Tapping mode imaging was performed using a Dimension
FastScan AFM (Bruker) as follows: FastScan-D (Bruker) cantilevers
(nominal stiffness 0.25 N/m, nominal resonant frequency 100 kHz in
liquid) were tuned to a frequency close to resonance and an amplitude
of approximately 1 nm. AFM scans were collected at a line rate of
4–8 Hz. The amplitude set point was adjusted to approximately
90% of the off-surface value. Feedback gains were optimized to ensure
proper surface tracking with minimal error signal. The tuning, amplitude
set point, and feedback gains were adjusted as required during scanning
to maintain image quality. The Z-range was reduced to minimize quantization
from the digital to analog converter outputting the Z-piezo signal
and reduce noise in the high voltage amplifier driving the Z-piezo.
Imaging buffer conditions were optimized by collecting approach curves
(amplitude and deflection) on chromatophore vesicles under varying
salt concentrations (Figure 1a,b). Higher salt concentrations gave a steeper reduction
in amplitude as a function of distance due to screening of repulsive
double-layer forces16 and indicating that
the tip makes a closer approach to the membrane under high salt conditions.
A buffer containing 300 mM KCl and 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, with and without
10 mM MgCl2, gave consistently good results. Cytbc1 was YFP labeled so that the approximately
4 nm YFP attached to cytbc1 might help
in locating the cytbc1 in the chromatophore.
YFP-labeled cytbc1 was not seen, and no
difference was observed between the AFM images of 50 wild-type and
more than 100 YFP-labeled cytbc1 chromatophores,
and the combined data were analyzed for improved statistics. It is
assumed that the YFP label was not imaged by the AFM tip, presumably
due to its mobility.
