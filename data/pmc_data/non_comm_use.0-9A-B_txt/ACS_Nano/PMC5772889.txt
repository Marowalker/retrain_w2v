Combining the ability
to localize electromagnetic fields at the
nanoscale with a directional response, plasmonic antennas offer an
effective strategy to shape the far-field pattern of coupled emitters.
Here, we introduce a family of directional multiresonant antennas
that allows for polarization-resolved spectral identification of fluorescent
emission. The geometry consists of a central aperture surrounded by
concentric polygonal corrugations. By varying the periodicity of each
axis of the polygon individually, this structure can support multiple
resonances that provide independent control over emission directionality
for multiple wavelengths. Moreover, since each resonant wavelength
is directly mapped to a specific polarization orientation, spectral
information can be encoded in the polarization state of the out-scattered
beam. To demonstrate the potential of such structures in enabling
simplified detection schemes and additional functionalities in sensing
and imaging applications, we use the central subwavelength aperture
as a built-in nanocuvette and manipulate the fluorescent response
of colloidal-quantum-dot emitters coupled to the multiresonant antenna.

Plasmonic
nanoantennas have
the capability to confine electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale
as well as shape scattered light into the far field.1,2 Careful design of these nanostructures allows controlled in- and
out-coupling of targeted wavelengths, propagation directions, and
polarization states of light.3 Such properties
can be used to engineer light–matter interactions in, for example,
light-harvesting4,5 and light-emitting technologies.6 In addition, plasmonic nanoantennas have been
extensively employed in spectroscopic and molecular sensing applications.7 Specifically, efficient near-field coupling between
molecules and plasmonic antennas can lead to dramatically improved
detection limits, enabling sensitivities down to the single-molecule
level.8−11 At the same time, the antenna design can be used to structure and
provide directionality to the far-field radiation pattern of the emission.12−15

A particularly successful example among directional plasmonic
nanoantennas
is the so-called bull’s-eye structure, which has the ability
to generate a tightly confined beam of light in the out-of-plane direction.16−18 These antenna structures consist of concentric circular corrugations
with a fixed periodicity. In a bull’s-eye with periodicity
Λ, the out-scattering angle θ of a propagating surface
plasmon is determined, for a specific wavelength λ, through
the momentum matching condition: 1  where k0 is the
momentum of the scattered light, m is an integer
indicating the diffracted order, ksp is
the momentum of the plasmon, kg is the
additional momentum provided by the corrugations, and nsp is the effective refractive index seen by the propagating
surface plasmon. From eq 1, it follows that light from the first diffraction order is scattered
out in the direction normal to the metal surface when λ = Λnsp, generating the distinct resonant19 beaming behavior that is characteristic of these
structures.20,21

Bull’s-eye antennas
have been successfully employed to shape
the far-field radiation profiles of dipole emitters, including colloidal
quantum dots,22−25 molecular fluorophores,26,27 and nitrogen-vacancy
centers in diamond.28 For example, the
placement of dyes of different colors inside the central nanoaperture
of a bull’s-eye results in efficient directional sorting and
improved detection efficiency of fluorescence.29 Thanks to the on-resonant unidirectional emission imposed
by the bull’s-eye antenna, single-molecule sensitivity can
be achieved in such a system, even when using low numerical-aperture
collection optics.30 An additional advantage
of using nanoaperture bull’s-eyes in fluorescent sensing is
the ability to provide selective excitation of small analyte volumes
present inside the aperture, thereby significantly reducing background
fluorescence.31

While providing excellent
control over directionality, conventional
bull’s-eyes are “single-resonant” structures,
designed to provide beaming for only one color.19,32 However, in many sensing applications it is required to simultaneously
probe multiple spectral features, for example, when distinguishing
between different fluorescent labels33,34 or for dual-resonant
enhancement of Raman signals.35−38 Such sensing applications would therefore benefit
from a platform that can support resonances for more than one color,
while providing directionality for each wavelength individually.

In this work, we present a family of compact multiresonant bull’s-eye
antennas for spectral sorting of fluorescence, in which independent
control over the directionality of the various resonant colors can
be obtained. Our structures consist of concentric polygons that surround
a central nanoaperture (see Figure 1). In contrast to the concentric circles of the traditional
bull’s-eye aperture, a concentric polygonal structure can accommodate
multiple resonances through variations in the periodicity along the
different axes. Importantly, this allows independent directional control
and parallel beaming of multiple wavelengths simultaneously. Moreover,
benefiting from the breaking of symmetry in the concentric geometry,
our multiresonant platform directly associates each resonance with
a unique linear polarization.39−42 Combined with the controlled directionality of emission,
it becomes possible to generate polarization-multiplexed parallel
beams of light, in which spectral information is efficiently encoded
in their polarization state. We will demonstrate that the subwavelength
central nanoaperture of our structures can be used as a nanocuvette
to probe the optical response of fluorescent emitters, such as colloidal
quantum dots.

Results
Our multiresonant aperture antennas are fabricated using focused-ion-beam
(FIB) milling of single-crystalline silver films grown on mica substrates
(see Methods for details). High-resolution
scanning electron micrographs of a concentric rectangle (Λ1 = 515 nm, Λ2 = 635 nm) and a concentric
hexagon (Λ1 = 515 nm, Λ2 = 575 nm,
Λ3 = 635 nm) are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. Around the circular central
aperture, which is 210 nm in diameter, a total of 20 grooves with
a depth of 60 nm were defined (see Figure 1e for the geometrical parameters of the structure
and section 3 of the Supporting Information for more details on the structure performance and full-width-at-half-maximum
of the resonances). The use of single-crystalline films has two main
advantages. First, the reduced surface roughness and the absence of
grain boundaries allow for increased plasmon propagation lengths.43,44 Second, it has been demonstrated that single-crystalline silver
provides more homogeneous etching rates during focused-ion-beam milling
and thus preserves the smooth surface after patterning, once more
providing longer plasmon propagation lengths.44 These two effects should reduce random scattering and consequently
lead to an improved control over the surface-plasmon out-scattering
in our system.

To investigate the influence of our multiresonant
concentric geometry
on the angular and spectral scattering of light, we use k-space transmission microscopy. While illuminating the structure
with quasi-monochromatic light (selected from a white light source
using band-pass filters of 10 nm bandwidth, see Methods section for details) from the unpatterned back side, transmitted
light is collected from the corrugated front side using a high-numerical-aperture
(NA = 0.8) objective (see Figure 2a for a schematic). k-space microscopy
images of the transmitted light are obtained by imaging the back focal
plane of the collection objective. The measurement yields angularly
resolved intensity maps across the ±53° collection cone
of the objective.

multiresonant antenna. (a) Schematic of k-space measurements
where transmitted quasi-monochromatic light is collected using a high-NA
objective (NA = 0.8). (b,c) Normalized k-space color

± 5 nm unpolarized excitation light. The diffraction patterns

for selected polarization orientations. (f) The Stokes parameter S1 obtained using k-space polarimetry
measurements for both 550 nm (top) and 650 nm (bottom) excitation
quantifies the ability of the antenna to convert an unpolarized input
into a polarized and directional beam. Dashed white lines indicate
the numerical aperture of the objective.

Figure 2b,c shows
the k-space maps for two different colors of quasi-monochromatic
light transmitted through the aperture of the concentric rectangle
shown in Figure 1a.
Orthogonally oriented arc-like patterns of high transmission intensity
are observed for each incident color. These arcs are characteristic
of the dispersion relation for the two orthogonally oriented linear
gratings where the scattering angle is dependent on the grating period
(see eq 1). The variation
in the periodicity of orthogonal corrugations results, for the rectangular
case, in distinct positions of the arcs in k-space
as further confirmed by numerical simulations (see the Supporting Information). For example, while green
light (λ1 = 550 ± 5 nm) shows resonant out-coupling, via the x-axis periodicity (Λ1 = 515 nm), leading to high scattering intensity in the normal
direction (kx/k0 and ky/k0 ≈ 0), light is scattered
out at larger angles from the y axis (Λ2 = 635 nm). Conversely, red light (λ2 = 650
± 5 nm) is off-resonant with the x axis, while
on-resonant with the y axis. This clearly demonstrates
the basic operation principle of the rectangular dual-resonant antenna
where the structure’s geometry along the two axes can be controlled
independently to satisfy the resonant condition for separate colors.
Moreover, the high degree of angular control obtained through our
structures is illustrated by the small width of the resonances at
the center of k-space, measuring full-width-at-half-maxima
(fwhm) of around ±2°.

A fundamental aspect of the
surface-plasmon scattering by our multiresonant
geometry is that the scattered-light polarization is acquired from
the parallel polarization component of the propagating surface plasmons.
It is therefore oriented along the respective axis of the polygon
and parallel to the grating vector.45,46 To decompose
the scattered patterns of Figure 2b,c into the different polarization components, we
introduce a linear polarizer after the collection objective of Figure 2a. The horizontal
and vertical polarization contributions are shown for green and red
light in Figure 2d,e,
respectively (for example, in the green case the 0° horizontal
contributions are generated due to scattering from the vertically
oriented periodicity of 515 nm and, correspondingly, the 90°
contributions come from the orthogonally oriented horizontal grating
periodicity which is not resonant with the green color). It is evident
from these maps that the resonant conditions for the two colors occur
at orthogonal polarization orientations and are separable using a
linear polarizer.

To quantify the polarizing properties of our
device, we perform k-space polarimetry using the
combination of a quarter-wave
plate followed by a linear polarizer as discussed in ref (47). By performing angle-resolved
polarimetry of the transmitted light, we can retrieve the Stokes parameters
to fully characterize the polarization state of the resulting optical
beam (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information
for a schematic of the measurement setup and for the full polarimetric
characterization of the rectangular multiresonant bull’s-eye).
For example, the Stokes parameter S1,
shown in Figure 2f,g
for the two resonant wavelengths, quantifies the amount of linearly
horizontal (LHP) and linearly vertical polarization (LVP) that our
structure imposes on the scattered light (S1 = LHP – LVP).48−50S1 describes the ability
of this multiresonant antenna to convert an unpolarized input into
a polarized and directional beam. At the center of k-space, for both wavelengths, we find maxima of |S1| that reach >0.75, demonstrating that each wavelength
has been efficiently mapped to a specific corresponding polarization.

Compared to the relatively simple orthogonal patterns generated
by a concentric rectangle, more complex k-space patterns
are obtained when using higher-order polygons. For example, using
green (λ1 = 550 ± 5 nm), orange (λ2 = 600 ± 5 nm), and red (λ3 = 650 ±
5 nm) illumination colors, k-space maps for the hexagonal
bull’s-eye of Figure 1b are shown in Figure 3. Resonant conditions can be observed every 60°, as imposed
by the hexagonal geometry of our antenna for the different resonant
colors (see Figure 3a–c). These resonant conditions become more apparent when
using a linear polarizer, providing selective transmission of the
three different beaming conditions (see Figure 3d–f). As for the rectangular case,
each polarization contribution is obtained mainly via scattering from the orthogonally oriented axis of the structure.
Similarly, polarization resolved k-space maps of
the transmission of four different colors through an octagonal structure
are presented in the Supporting Information, with resonant conditions in this case occurring with the expected
45° separations. Therefore, while the presence of additional
diffraction arcs increases the complexity of the k-space maps, introducing a linear polarization analyzer provides
an effective way to emphasize the individual resonances.

Figure 3 k-space measurements of hexagonal multiresonant
antenna. Normalized k-space color maps for light
scattered off the structure in Figure 1b. We use (a) 550 ± 5, (b) 600 ± 5, and (c)
650 ± 5 nm wavelength excitation. (d–f) From the patterns
in parts (a–c), the different polarization components, for
which a color-dependent beaming condition is satisfied, are separated.
Due to the geometry of the structure, this occurs every 60°.

The presented direct mapping of each resonant color
to a unique
linear polarization, combined with the directional control over the
out-scattering angle, provides us with the opportunity to generate
multiplexed beams of light in which spectral information is encoded
in the polarization state of the beam. To demultiplex and isolate
the directional scattering of the resonant condition in the out-of-plane
direction, we polarization-resolve the light collected with a low
numerical aperture (NA = 0.06) objective that is sensitive only to
a small cone of out-scattering angles (∼6.8°) (see schematic
in Figure 4a). This
angular selection is necessary to isolate a unique polarization for
each color, filtering out the nonresonant arcs that are scattered
out at larger angles from their corresponding nonresonant axes (see k-space maps in Figure 2 and Figure 3).

Figure 4 Polarization-resolved spectroscopy. (a) Schematic of the detection
scheme. A color filter is used to generate quasi-monochromatic light
from a white-light source. Transmittance is collected using a numerical
aperture of 0.06 and analyzed with a rotating linear polarizer. (b–d)
Normalized transmitted intensity is measured as a function of polarization
angle for different excitation wavelengths (red markers for λ
= 650 ± 5 nm, orange for λ = 600 ± 5 nm, green for
λ = 550 ± 5 nm, and blue for λ = 500 ± 5 nm)
sent through a (b) rectangular, (c) hexagonal, and (d) octagonal multiresonant
antenna.

The polarization-dependent response
of our multiresonant structures
to different excitation wavelengths is reported in polar coordinates
in Figure 4b–d.
In the case of the rectangular antenna, the highest transmitted intensity
for two different excitation wavelengths (red and green) is found
at orthogonal analyzer angles, as predicted by the k-space maps. In the case of a hexagonal structure, these maxima occur
for angles shifted by 60°. To extend the multiresonant concept
further, we also present the case of the octagonal configuration,
in which resonances occur approximately at the expected 45° separation.
Slight shifts in the estimated polarization angles can arise when
the number of periodicities is significantly increased due to cross-talk
of polarization components located at each individual axis. Generally,
the measured behavior closely follows the numerical predictions obtained
in simulations (see the Supporting Information for more details).

To demonstrate how our multiresonant antennas
can be used to structure
the emission of fluorescent labels, we place colloidal-quantum-dot
emitters inside the central aperture. Colloidal quantum dots (cQDs)
are commonly used in biological fluorescent labeling thanks to their
size-tunable spectral properties as well as bright and photostable
emission.51 Importantly, they exhibit narrow
emission line widths, making them particularly suited for color-selective
sensing. Here, we use a size series of CdSe/CdZnS core/shell QDs with
emission colors in the green (λem = 565 nm), orange
(λem = 600 nm), and red (λem = 635
nm), for which the emission spectra are shown in Figure 5a. Each antenna is coated with
a single emitter color by drop-casting the QDs from dispersion. We
excite the aperture from the unpatterned backside of our antenna using
a 488 nm continuous wave (CW) laser (see schematics in Figure S9a,b). The subwavelength nature of the
central nanoaperture and the presence of the optically thick Ag film
around it, allow for spatially selective excitation of the emitters
inside the aperture.22,33,52 The fluorescence is collected with a low-NA objective (NA = 0.06)
from the corrugated side of the structure. In Figure 5b we show the polarization-dependent fluorescent
intensity collected from a set of two rectangular structures, each
coated with one of the two resonant emission-color QDs, in this case
red and green. The expected orthogonal polarization for the two colors
is indeed obtained. Similarly, Figure 5c shows the same measurement for a set of three hexagonal
antennas, in this case coated with QDs of either green, orange, or
red emission.

multiresonant
bull’s-eye antennas. Colloidal CdSe/CdZnS quantum dots (cQDs)
are coupled to the aperture of the multiresonant antennas. (a) Normalized
emission spectra of cQDs with core sizes of 2.4, 2.8, and and 4.1
nm. (b,c) Fluorescence intensity recorded using a NA = 0.06 as a function

and (c) green, orange, and red cQDs on hexagonal bull’s-eyes.
(d–h) Complete fluorescence k-space maps where
(d,e) correspond to the measurements in part (b) and (f–h)
to the measurements in (c) collected using a NA = 0.8.

From the corresponding measured fluorescence k-space maps for hexagonal antennas that are shown in Figure 5d–h, we can notice that,
compared to the transmission measurements of Figure 4, the larger QD line width and smaller difference
in the periodicities of the design (Λ1 = 522 nm and
Λ2 = 602 nm due to the reduced spectral separation
of the QD emission) introduce a slight broadening and overlap of the
different sets of arcs increasing polarization cross-talk. This requires
the use of small NAs in order to select only the resonant set of arcs
of a color and reject the other polarizations. Nevertheless, in applications
where high sensitivity is required, like single QD detection, higher
numerical apertures can also be used to collect the structured light
at the cost of reduced selectivity (see section 5 of the Supporting Information for a more detailed discussion).

Despite the occurrence of increased cross-talk in the hexagonal
structure, causing a reduced on–off ratio in the polarization
dependence and a slight shift from the expected 60° separation,
the three colors obtain clearly distinct polarization angles (see Figure 5c). This demonstrates
the ability of our antenna platform to structure the fluorescence
of coupled emitters even in the hexagonal case. These characteristics
of the fluorescent beam allow to resolve spectral components using
linear polarization analysis and simplified detection schemes.

Conclusions
Combining multiresonant performance with controlled directionality
and straightforward design principles, we have introduced a multiresonant
plasmonic antenna that can efficiently tailor directionality and polarization
of fluorescent emission. Through its built-in nanocuvette aperture,
the presented antenna platform provides opportunities for next-generation
sensing technologies toward single-emitter resolution.53 Specifically, polarization multiplexing of spectral
information, as demonstrated through our polarization-resolved spectroscopy
scheme, enables new concepts in molecular sequencing analysis. Polarization-resolved
spectroscopy may benefit from high-speed signal modulation using,
for example, photoelastic modulators, a strategy that may enable faster
detection schemes in fluorescence-based sequencing techniques.52 Moreover, the high polarization dependence of
our structure can add new functionalities to existing sequencing methods
as well as be employed for dynamic color tuning54 or to generate multicolor or holographic on-chip sources.55

Methods
Fabrication
of Ag Antennas
Highest quality grade mica
disks with a diameter of 15 mm were freshly cleaved before deposition
to reveal clean and flat faces. Silver (Ag) films of 250 nm thickness
were epitaxially grown on the mica substrates via dc magnetron sputtering (Lesker PVD 75).44 Before deposition, a base pressure lower than 10–8 Torr was reached. Sputtering of Ag was performed at an argon pressure
of 6 mTorr and a dc power of 400 W while the substrate temperature
was maintained at 360 °C to yield single-crystalline films.

Focused-ion-beam milling (Helios 450, FEI) was used to pattern the
desired geometries into the Ag films with an acceleration voltage
of 30 kV and a beam current of 40 pA. Serial patterning of two different
etching depths was performed to mill the corrugations and the hole,
respectively.

Experimental Setups
Our transmission-angle-resolved
setup is based on a Ti–U inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped
with an optional Fourier transforming lens. Light from a white-light
LED (Thorlabs MWWHLP1K) is collimated, filtered with 10 nm full-width-at-half-maximum
(fwhm) bandpass filters (Thorlabs), and focused at the back of the
sample using an excitation objective (NA = 0.6). The scattered light
was measured using a collection objective with NA = 0.8. k-space polarimetry measurements were performed by introducing a quarter-wave
plate and a linear polarization analyzer at the back of the collection
objective. A pinhole was introduced at the microscope exit port focal
plane. k-space maps were recorded using a charged-coupled
device (PIXIS 256E, Princeton Instruments). To measure the polarization-dependent
beaming of the multiresonant antennas, we used a collection objective
with NA = 0.06 and a linear polarizer. Fluorescence images were recorded
using a fiber coupled CW excitation laser operating at 488 nm (OBIS,
Coherent).

Synthesis and Deposition of Core/Shell CdSe/CdZnS
Quantum Dots
The synthesis of CdSe/CdZnS quantum dots was
performed according
to the method reported by Boldt et al.(56) (see the Supporting Information for details). The synthesis resulted in CdSe/CdZnS core/shell nanocrystals
with an emission peak at 635 nm and fwhm of 29 nm for red-emitting
quantum dots, 600 nm with fwhm of 35 nm for orange-emitting dots,
and 565 nm with fwhm of 31 nm for green-emitting quantum dots.

The colloidal quantum dots were deposited on the patterned Ag films
using drop-casting from 9:1 hexane/octane solutions. A volume of 20
μL of the dispersions was deposited on the 15 mm diameter disks
to create a quantum dot film in the aperture of the antennas.

Numerical
Simulations
Three-dimensional finite element
modeling (FEM) of the structure was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics
5.2a. The simulated structure is composed of a 250 nm thick film with
5 periodic corrugations surrounding a central hole. The single-crystalline
Ag optical properties used for calculations were measured from the
fabricated films using spectroscopic ellipsometry (V-VASE, J. A. Woollam
Co.). The model was excited with monochromatic TE and TM polarized
fields and surrounded by cylindrical perfectly matched layers. For
hexagonal bull’s-eye structures, the full geometry was simulated,
whereas for the rectangular structure a quarter of the geometry with
appropriate boundary conditions for the two orthogonal polarizations
was sufficient. Far-field plots of a polarized input were obtained
and postprocessed using Matlab to generate response for unpolarized
or arbitrarily polarized inputs. Transmission versus polarization plots were obtained by selecting an NA = 0.06 from
the calculated far-field plots.
