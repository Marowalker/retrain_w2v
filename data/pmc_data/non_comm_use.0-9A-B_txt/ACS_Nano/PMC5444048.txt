We
demonstrate the growth of overlapping grain boundaries in continuous,
polycrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayer films via scalable catalytic chemical vapor deposition. Unlike
the commonly reported atomically stitched grain boundaries, these
overlapping grain boundaries do not consist of defect lines within
the monolayer films but are composed of self-sealing bilayer regions
of limited width. We characterize this overlapping h-BN grain boundary
structure in detail by complementary (scanning) transmission electron
microscopy techniques and propose a catalytic growth mechanism linked
to the subsurface/bulk of the process catalyst and its boron and nitrogen
solubilities. Our data suggest that the overlapping grain boundaries
are comparatively resilient against deleterious pinhole formation
associated with grain boundary defect lines and thus may reduce detrimental
breakdown effects when polycrystalline h-BN monolayer films are used
as ultrathin dielectrics, barrier layers, or separation membranes.

==== Body
Hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN)
is a two-dimensional (2D) insulator with a wide application profile,1 including its use as an ultimately thin dielectric
in electronics,2,3 a tunnel barrier in spintronics,4,5 an encapsulation and barrier layer in electronics and metallurgy,6 and a suspended separation membrane in nanofluidics.7,8 All these applications require scalable manufacturing of h-BN films,
whereby in particular pinhole-free continuous h-BN films of controlled
layer number are desired. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
has emerged as a promising technique to achieve growth of continuous
h-BN films, including exclusive monolayer growth.9−21 CVD h-BN films are typically polycrystalline, and control of their
microstructure, in particular grain boundary (GB) structure, is important
for many applications. Current literature reports the nature of the
as-grown GBs in h-BN as atomically stitched, composed of defect lines
within a h-BN monolayer (Figure 1a).22−34 Preferential pinhole formation is reported at such atomically stitched
GBs,30 and due to their structure, they
are intrinsically prone to electrical breakdown,35,36 chemical attack, or mechanical failure,26,34 all of which may render monolayer h-BN films ineffective in their
envisaged applications as an ultrathin dielectric, barrier layer,
or separation membrane. Recent reports on 2D materials other than
h-BN however suggest the possibility to form a different type of GB,
namely, overlapping GBs, where two merging 2D monolayer grains form
a bilayer region of limited width at the GB instead of a defect line
within the monolayer.37−40 Overlapping GBs remain unexplored for h-BN films thus far.

h-BN: (a) Atomically stitched GB formed by a chemically
bonded interface between two grains within the h-BN monolayer, mediated
by defect/dislocation lines (after ref (33)). (b) Overlapping GB that has
a van-der-Waals-type interface where two monolayer h-BN grains merge via a turbostratically stacked bilayer region of limited
width.

Here we show using complementary
(scanning) transmission electron
microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques41,42 that GBs in monolayer
h-BN films grown by scalable catalytic CVD not only can be atomically
stitched but can indeed also be overlapping in nature. We confirm
that in overlapping GBs in h-BN monolayer films two h-BN monolayer
grains merge via the self-sealing formation of a
turbostratic bilayer region of limited width and thereby without formation
of a defect line within the monolayer (Figure 1b). We characterize this overlapping GB structure
in detail, identify catalytic CVD conditions that result in such GB
structure, and propose possible underlying catalytic growth mechanisms.
Our data suggest that overlapping GBs are comparatively resilient
against detrimental pinhole formation, as evolving defects in one
layer are sealed by the second layer. Thus, overlapping GBs may be
technologically advantageous for the many h-BN applications for which
continuous pinhole-free h-BN monolayers are key. We aim at expanding
the understanding of GB formation and control in heteroelemental 2D
materials such as h-BN, which directly links to their properties and
various application profiles.

Results and Discussion
We adopt
a recently reported18 monolayer
h-BN film CVD protocol in which the employed polycrystalline Fe catalyst
foils are pretreated in ammonia gas (NH3, 4 mbar) before
h-BN growth (∼900 °C) by exposure to borazine (B3N3H6, ∼6 × 10–4 mbar) vapor. Figure 2a,b shows scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the resulting monolayer
h-BN films on the Fe catalyst in their nucleation stage (a) and after
closure into a continuous h-BN monolayer film (b). To elucidate the
GB structure of the closed h-BN films, we transfer43−45 the h-BN from
the Fe catalyst onto TEM grids and study the as-suspended h-BN films
using dark-field (DF) and bright-field (BF) TEM (80 kV, including
selected area electron diffraction (SAED))41 and aberration-corrected STEM (60 kV).42

h-BN monolayers are from electron beam induced damage during STEM
imaging.50,51Supporting Figure S2 plots raw, high angle annular dark field (HAADF) and Fourier transform
(FT) data of (f). Lattice distances, intensity ratios of N/B sites,42 and layer-by-layer sputtering confirm that in
(f) two monolayer h-BN grains merge in a bilayered overlapping GB
(Supporting Figure S3).

Figure 2c shows
a false color coded composite of DF-TEM images across a GB in the
closed h-BN film from Figure 2b, where the DF-TEM image from one h-BN monolayer grain (red,
taken via the red circled reflection in the SAED
pattern in Figure 2d) is overlaid onto the DF-TEM image of a second neighboring h-BN
monolayer grain (blue, blue circled reflection in Figure 2d). Notably, along the boundary
between the two merging grains a pink region of ∼5 nm width
(highlighted by white arrows) is visible in Figure 2c, in which the two h-BN grains apparently overlap. This impression of an overlapping region along
the GB is further corroborated by plotting the Boolean AND signal
of both DF-TEM images in Figure 2e. Our DF-TEM data thereby suggest that GBs in our
h-BN films are not of the commonly reported22−30 atomically stitched type but instead that grains merge in an overlapping
region of limited width i.e., via an overlapping GB. The two here depicted merging
grains have a relative misorientation of ∼26° as derived
from the SAED in Figure 2d, implying that the small width bilayer region is turbostratically
stacked.10,46−49

The existence of overlapping
GBs in our films is further confirmed
at atomic resolution by the STEM image in Figure 2f. Consistent with the DF-TEM, the STEM image
clearly shows that one monolayer h-BN grain (top, inset) merges with
the second monolayer grain (bottom, inset) in a bilayer h-BN region
of ∼10 nm width (middle, inset). Because of the in-plane misorientation
between the two merging h-BN grains, the overlapping bilayer region
exhibits a Moiré pattern, consistent with the SAED in Figure 2d. We find a range
of ∼5–15 nm for the overlap width for other imaged GB
regions for these CVD conditions.

Our data indicate that, unlike
in the normally reported atomically
stitched GBs,22−30 in our overlapping GBs no defect lines are formed within the h-BN
monolayers when two h-BN nuclei impinge upon each other during extended
growth. Instead, the h-BN layer terminations of each grain are placed
on top/under an intact second h-BN monolayer, which suggests that
the formation of GB-associated pinholes may be mitigated in the overlapping
GBs.

This relative resilience of the overlapping GBs against
pinhole
formation is indeed qualitatively corroborated by the STEM observation
of electron beam induced sputtering of an h-BN film in Figure 3, when taking the resilience
against electron beam induced hole formation as a proxy for pinhole
formation: In Figure 3 we observe layer-by-layer sputtering in an h-BN monolayer film,
comparing the monolayer basal plane (Figure 3a) and an overlapping GB (Figure 3b).50 Importantly, under continuous electron beam exposure several extended
pinholes to vacuum are readily formed in the monolayer h-BN region.
This is in stark contrast to the bilayer overlapping GB region, where
only point defects in one layer are formed but an intact second layer
remains; that is, damage to the film is comparatively reduced in the
overlapping GB region. This underscores that, in contrast to typically
reported atomically stitched GBs where sputtering occurs preferentially
on the weakly bonded defect lines rather than in the monolayer basal
planes,30 in our h-BN films it is easier
to open a pinhole to vacuum in the basal plane of the constituent
h-BN grains than in the self-sealing overlapping GB region. This indicates
that in our h-BN films the intrinsic properties of the h-BN monolayer
lattice rather than GB-associated defect lines determine resistance
against pinhole formation.

Figure 3 Double Gaussian filtered42 MAADF STEM
images of (a) a monolayer h-BN region and (b) a bilayer region in
an overlapping GB (∼21° misorientation angle, see FT in Supporting Figure S4) in a monolayer h-BN film.
The left images in (a) and (b) show the respective first image taken
at this magnification (0 s), after which the electron beam was scanned
continuously for 70 s over the shown area. The respective right images
in (a) and (b) were then acquired after these 70 s of continuous beam
exposure. The sputtering series clearly displays that at these imaging
conditions in the monolayer region several holes to vacuum are readily
opened (where typically even within the first acquisition frame a
first defect emerges that widens in the subsequent 70 s beam exposure,
as also seen here). In contrast, in the bilayer region in the overlapping
GB no hole to vacuum has been opened by the 70 s beam exposure, but
only indications for sputter-induced point defects in one layer are
observed, while the second layer remained intact. This shows that
the h-BN monolayer basal plane itself is more susceptible to electron
beam induced pinhole formation than the bilayer region in the overlapping
GB.

We find no clear preferential
orientation of the initial h-BN nuclei
with respect to the underlying polycrystalline Fe catalyst for our
growth conditions (Figure 2a).18 This implies that the misorientation
angles and distances between merging h-BN grains are not epitaxially
fixed by the Fe catalyst for these CVD conditions but are rather of
random nature. In line with this we find no clear rotational misalignment
dependence in our overlapping GBs. Within the examined DF-TEM data
set/samples overlapping GBs were the predominant type of GB, although
this does not exclude the possibility that to a lesser degree also
atomically stitched GBs may arise for these CVD conditions (although
such were not observed). Similar to normal atomically stitched GBs,41 also the overlapping GBs preferentially attract
contamination from adventitious hydrocarbon adsorption (Figure 2f), which is related to the
increased chemical reactivity/dangling bonds at the edges of the overlapping
regions. In contrast to atomically stitched GBs, in the overlapping
GBs these reactive sites are however placed on top of a second intact h-BN layer.

A key question arising from the
observation of the overlapping
GBs is which factors enable their growth. We have previously shown18 that with the here employed Fe catalyst foils
the pretreatment stage with NH3 is key to facilitate monolayer
h-BN growth instead of uncontrolled multilayer formation. This is
due to Fe having finite solubilities and diffusivities for B and N,
which leads to dissolution of both B and N into the Fe catalyst bulk
during borazine exposure when an N-free pretreatment gas, such as
H2, is used. For H2 pretreatment, this B/N dissolution
before h-BN nucleation results in multilayer h-BN pyramids without
film closure (Supporting Figure S5) from
a mixed growth mode of isothermal multilayer h-BN surface growth and
precipitation growth of additional h-BN layers upon cooling (driven
out of the catalyst bulk due to the strongly decreasing B/N solubilities
in Fe with cooling).18,52 Pretreating in a N-containing
gas53 such as NH3 was found
to prefill the catalyst bulk with N, thus hindering uptake of B (or
further N) into the catalyst bulk upon the subsequent borazine exposure
and thus forcing an isothermal surface growth mode of exclusive monolayer
h-BN growth (Figure 2a,b),18 as here employed. Our now here
presented observation of overlapping GBs with bilayer regions of limited
width in these monolayer h-BN films in turn suggests that this prefill
with N is not complete but leaves the possibility for a small remaining
contribution from the catalyst subsurface/bulk toward the growth of
the small bilayer region in the overlapping GB. We suggest that the
growth of this limited width bilayer occurs isothermally when two
monolayer h-BN grains extend toward each other, and then, upon impingement,
one layer grows for a limited width underneath the other layer fed via the only partly deactivated catalyst subsurface/bulk,
analogous to subsequent layer growth from below in graphene CVD.54 We, however, note that, alternatively, also
precipitation of B and N from the limited reservoir in the catalyst
subsurface/bulk upon cooling may add laterally to an existing h-BN
monolayer near the junction of two not yet merged monolayer grains,
resulting in growth of one layer under the other and thus an overlapping
GB bilayer region of limited width. While without in situ experimentation the exact growth kinetics remain unknown, both scenarios
imply that for controlling the formation of overlapping GBs the catalyst
subsurface/bulk contribution to growth is key.

To test this
hypothesis, we present in Figure 4 the effect of reducing the
NH3 pretreatment pressure. Such a reduced NH3 pretreatment pressure should result in even less complete catalyst
prefilling with N and thus an increased catalyst subsurface/bulk contribution
to growth, be it isothermal or from precipitation upon cooling. Figure 4a,b show a false
color composite DF-TEM image, and Figure 4c shows a thickness-sensitive STEM image
of a typical GB in a continuous h-BN monolayer film from NH3 pretreatment at a reduced NH3 pressure
of 3 mbar (instead of 4 mbar as in Figure 2). Consistent with our data above, both DF-TEM
and STEM data in Figure 4 clearly indicate the formation of an overlapping GB at the border
between the two neighboring h-BN grains (misorientation angle ∼25°).
Notably, however, the reduced NH3 pretreatment pressure
has resulted in a significant increase in the width
of the overlapping region in the GB to ∼100 nm in Figure 4 (with a range of
∼20–110 nm for other imaged GBs on this reduced NH3 pretreatment pressure sample, as compared to only ∼5–15
nm in Figure 2). This
increased width of the overlapping region is in line with our hypothesis
above that a reduced N prefilling results in an increased catalyst
subsurface/bulk contribution to h-BN growth, which in turn facilitates
the formation of the wider overlapping GBs. Additional characterization
of the h-BN films from NH3 pretreatment at reduced pressure
further corroborates this increased contribution of the catalyst subsurface/bulk
to growth, as besides the predominant monolayer regions in these samples
also isolated multilayer pyramids on/under the continuous monolayer
regions are observed (Figure 4d). In contrast, no such multilayer pyramids were found in
the exclusive monolayer films from the higher NH3 pretreatment
pressure in Figure 2. This suggests that by controlling the level of prefilling of the
catalyst subsurface/bulk the width of the overlapping GBs in the h-BN
films can be controlled. This control is however coupled to a transition
from exclusive monolayer film growth (high NH3 pretreatment
pressure, Figure 2)
to mixed monolayer/multilayer film (reduced NH3 pretreatment
pressure, Figure 4)
and finally to growth of only isolated multilayer h-BN pyramids (H2 pretreatment, i.e., no
N prefilling, Supporting Figure S5). We
emphasize that the suggested increased subsurface/bulk contribution
to h-BN from NH3 pretreatment at reduced pressure is also
consistent with our previous in situ X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy characterization of h-BN growth.18 The measured range of misorientation angles of grains with overlapping
GBs for the reduced NH3 pretreatment pressure conditions
is ∼5° to ∼25°. We find no obvious correlation
between overlapping region width (range of ∼20–110 nm)
and grain misorientation (range of 5–25°) angle of the
overlapping GBs for these conditions. This further reaffirms that
the NH3 pretreatment pressure is the determining factor
for the overlapping GB growth, while the h-BN grain misorientation
angle in the turbostratic bilayer overlap regions appears to be less
important under our conditions. This is also exemplified when considering
that in Figures 2 and 3 the high 4 mbar pressure NH3 pretreatment
yields only a few nanometer overlap (up to 15 nm) for misorientations
of ∼21° to ∼26°, while for a misorientation
angle in the same range (∼25°) the reduced 3 mbar NH3 pretreatment yields up to 110 nm overlap in Figure 4.

overlapping GB in a closed h-BN film from NH3 pretreatment
at reduced pressure (3 mbar). The sawtoothed shape
of the edge of the blue color-coded grain is typical for diffusion
effects during growth of high-quality monolayer h-BN grains.14,18,55 The formation of holes in the
h-BN film is ascribed to film transfer and/or TEM imaging, where notably
holes are predominantly located within the monolayer grains but not
within the overlapping GB region, consistent with Figure 3. (b) SAED pattern corresponding

colors. See Supporting Figure S6 for raw
data for (a) and (b). (c) STEM image of the GB in (a). (d) SEM micrograph

Despite h-BN’s wide application potential,
only few experimental
studies on GBs in monolayer h-BN are available to date,22−30 with particularly few at atomic resolution.23−25 Experimental
verification of proposed GB types in monolayer h-BN therefore remains
critically lacking.56 Among the experimental
studies only atomically stitched GBs22−30 were observed in monolayer h-BN, and also theoretical work has so
far only focused on atomically stitched GBs.31−34 In contrast, our work here highlights
that GBs in h-BN monolayer films can also be overlapping in nature,
demanding further consideration.

In the context of other 2D
materials, overlapping GBs have been
previously reported for CVD graphene37,38 and CVD MoS2.39,40 On a related note, overlapping heterostructure junction formation between h-BN and graphene has been previously
observed, where, in agreement with our data here, the type of heterojunction
was a function of CVD processing conditions.57 Similarly, overlapping heterostructure junctions have been recently
found between GaSe/MoSe2,58 highlighting
the generic but thus far often overlooked nature of the here reported
van-der-Waals-type overlapping GBs in 2D materials.

It is noteworthy
that among the few available reports22−30 on GBs in monolayer h-BN (where only atomically stitched GBs were
reported) mostly Cu has been investigated as a polycrystalline metallic
catalyst for scalable catalytic CVD conditions.24−28,30 Unlike Fe, which has
finite solubilities for both B and N, Cu has a finite solubility for
B but negligible solubility for N.11 This
intrinsically (i.e., without the
requirement for catalyst prefilling) limits h-BN growth on Cu to an
isothermal growth mode with an inherently restricted subsurface/bulk
contribution to growth.11 We note that,
in line with our suggested subsurface/bulk-mediated growth mechanism
for the overlapping GBs, this difference in B/N solubilities between
Cu and Fe and the resulting inherently smaller subsurface/bulk contribution
to growth on Cu may account for the absence24−28,30 of overlapping GBs
in the Cu-catalyzed h-BN monolayers.

While our data indicate
that the overlapping GBs may be beneficial
for avoiding pinhole formation in monolayer h-BN films, we note that
such van-der-Waals-type boundaries with turbostratic stacking in the
overlapping region may in turn reduce the tensile strength of a polycrystalline
2D material compared to atomically stitched GBs.34 Particularly for h-BN, also the doubled layer number along
the overlapping GBs has to be considered when the h-BN is desired
as a dielectric film where a constant dielectric thickness may be
key for device performance.36 Thus, whether
atomically stitched or overlapping GBs are preferable will partly
depend on the exact application requirements. Our introduction of
the overlapping GB type in h-BN monolayer films however critically
adds to the available toolbox for h-BN film microstructure control.

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that overlapping GBs can be introduced
into CVD h-BN monolayer films by controlling subsurface/bulk growth
contributions via rational catalyst and pretreatment
choice. In contrast to the commonly reported atomically stitched GBs
these overlapping GBs are not formed by a defect line within the monolayer
but comprise a self-sealing bilayer region of limited width. Our data
suggest that overlapping GBs are comparatively resilient against detrimental
pinhole formation. Thus, the overlapping GBs may mitigate failure
from GB-associated pinholes when polycrystalline h-BN monolayer films
are utilized as ultrathin dielectrics, barrier layers, or separation
membranes. Our results here aim at expanding the understanding of
GB formation in h-BN CVD and possible engineering to tailor h-BN film
morphology for application needs.

Methods
For growth of the monolayer h-BN films we adopt a recently reported
CVD protocol,18 using commercial Fe foils
(0.1 mm, Alfa Aesar, 99.99% purity) as catalyst and a customized Aixtron
BM3 as cold-wall reactor (base pressure 1 × 10–6 mbar). After pumping to base pressure, we pretreat the catalyst
in 3 (reduced pressure) or 4 (high pressure) mbar of NH3 (or, for reference, 4 mbar of H2) while ramping to a
temperature of ∼900 °C. After reaching ∼900 °C,
the pretreatment gas is removed and h-BN growth is initiated by dosing
borazine vapor (B3N3H6, 6 ×
10–4 mbar) into the reactor. For a closed film from
NH3 pretreatment the borazine exposure time was 480 s,
while shorter exposure times (45 s) arrested h-BN growth in the nucleation
stage. After exposure to borazine the reactor was pumped to base pressure
and the heater was switched off, leaving the samples to cool naturally
(initial cooling rate ∼300 °C/min) in a vacuum. For (S)TEM
characterization the h-BN films were transferred via the electrochemical bubbling method43 onto holey carbon TEM grids with regular hole arrays (Quantifoil,
∼1 μm hole diameters). BF- and DF-TEM41 and SAED of such transferred samples were measured in a
Philips CM200 TEM at 80 kV electron acceleration voltage. Atomically
resolved STEM was measured in an aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM
100 at an electron acceleration voltage of 60 kV while keeping the
sample in a vacuum of ∼10–9 mbar, simultaneously
acquiring HAADF (80 to 200 mrad) and MAADF (40 to 80 mrad) signals.
Typical beam currents of ∼30 pA equate for a spot size of ∼1
Å2 to typical electron dose rates directly under the
beam of ∼5 × 108 e– Å–2 s–1, which result in average dose
rates of ∼2 × 105 e– Å–2 s–1 for continuous scanning of
a 5 nm × 5 nm area (as in Figure 3). For further details on methods see the Supporting Information.
