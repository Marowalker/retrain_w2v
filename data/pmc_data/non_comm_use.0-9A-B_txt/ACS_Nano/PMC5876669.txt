The
stability of two neighboring surface nanobubbles on a chemically
heterogeneous surface is studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of binary mixtures consisting of Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles. A diffusion
equation-based stability analysis suggests that two nanobubbles sitting
next to each other remain stable, provided the contact line is pinned,
and that their radii of curvature are equal. However, many experimental
observations seem to suggest some long-term kind of ripening or shrinking
of the surface nanobubbles. In our MD simulations we find that the
growth/dissolution of the nanobubbles can occur due to the transfer
of gas particles from one nanobubble to another along the solid substrate. That is, if the interaction between the gas
and the solid is strong enough, the solid–liquid interface
can allow for the existence of a “tunnel” which connects
the liquid–gas interfaces of the two nanobubbles to destabilize
the system. The crucial role of the gas–solid interaction energy
is a nanoscopic element that hitherto has not been considered in any
macroscopic theory of surface nanobubbles and may help to explain
experimental observations of the long-term ripening.

Understanding
the stability
and the dynamics of surface nanobubbles,1−6 gaseous nanoscopic entities attached to hydrophobic surfaces, is
relevant from both a fundamental and an applicational point of view.
A single surface nanobubble will remain stable, provided a sufficient
gas oversaturation in the bulk liquid and pinning of the three phase
contact line.7−13 Lohse and Zhang7 showed that the equilibrium
contact angle is not dictated by Young’s law, but by the expression: 1  where L is the fixed (due
to pinning) diameter of the footprint (assumed to be spherical) and Lc = 4γ/P0 is the capillary length scale, γ is the surface
tension, and P0 is the ambient pressure.
Furthermore, in expression 1,  is the gas oversaturation, C∞ is gas concentration in the bulk liquid, and Cs is the saturation concentration
at pressure P0. The stability conditions
and expression 1 for the contact angle of a
single surface nanobubble at equilibrium were also confirmed by MD
simulations14 and experiments.15 In most practical scenarios, nanobubbles are
however not single, but exist in the neighborhood of other nanobubbles.1,16−20 A recent theoretical study21 shows that
two nanobubbles remain stable against Ostwald ripening (mathematically,
a linear instability), due to the pinning of the contact line. In
that calculation it was assumed that the distance between the two
nanobubbles was large compared to the lateral dimension of the nanobubbles.
However, as confirmed in recent numerical simulations based on the
advection-diffusion equation,22 nanobubbles
can also remain stable even when the distance between them is comparable
to the lateral length, provided that the radii of curvature of the
nanobubbles are equal. In that case, the stability is the consequence
of the absence of any concentration gradient of gas molecules in the
liquid. However, interestingly, while for pinning, oversaturation
ζ > 0, and equal radius of curvature Re = L/sin θe = Lc/ζ, the macroscopic theory predicts linear stability of the
two-nanobubble system, there have been many experimental observations
which show some sort of ripening/shrinking of surface nanobubble populations.11,18,23−25 This motivated
us to look into the problem at a microscopic scale using molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, which is perfectly suited for the length
scales and time scales involved in the problem.

In this paper,
we have studied the dynamics of two nanobubbles
sitting next to each other with their contact line pinned on a chemically
heterogeneous surface. Our simulations suggest a possible explanation
for the experimental observations of the ripening/shrinking of surface
nanobubbles, where we observe that under certain conditions the system
allows for transfer of gas particles from one nanobubble to a neighboring
one along the solid substrate. We find that the ripening of surface
nanobubbles strongly depends on the interaction energy between the
gas molecules and the solid substrate relative to the interaction
energy between the liquid molecules and the solid substrate.

Results
and Discussion
We performed MD simulations of two surface
nanobubbles sitting
next to each other on a chemically heterogeneous surface, so that
the contact line is pinned (see Figure 1). At time t = 0, both nanobubbles
have the same radius of curvature, lateral length, contact angle,
and number of gas particles inside the bubble. We performed the simulations
at constant pressure which means the solubility of gas particles is
fixed and can be manipulated by varying the system pressure. Figure 2a shows that the
number of gas particles in both nanobubbles remains constant with
time. We found that this is also true for the contact angle, the lateral
length, and the radii of both nanobubbles. In other words, the system
seems to be in steady state (also see Supplementary Movie S1). Note that the time for which we run the simulation
(∼550 ns) is longer than the diffusion time scale, τD ∼ Ly2/D = 400 ns, where Ly is the largest dimension
of the box, and D is the diffusivity of gas particles
in the bulk liquid.

Figure 1 A typical simulation box which consists of four kind of
particles.
Red particles (S) form the solid surface, yellow particles (SP) form pinning sites, blue particles (L), which are predominantly
in the liquid phase, and green particles (G), which are predominantly
in the gas phase. The nanobubbles shown in the figure are cylindrical
in shape where the length of the cylinder is in the x-direction. Periodic boundaries are employed in all three directions.

Figure 2 Variation of number of gas particles, θ, L, and R of two nanobubbles with time for
(a) ϵSG/ϵSL =
0.50 and (b) ϵSG/ϵSL = 1.11, and Cs = 17.3 × 10–5. Inset of top left plot
shows the number of gas particles inside two nanobubbles up to 560
ns which confirms the steady state. For ϵSG/ϵSL = 1.11 and at t = 175 ns, one can clearly notice the “stick-jump”
dissolution mode for the pinned case from the variation of θ, L, and R.

The stability of our system is consistent with the theoretical
arguments21 which suggest that the two-nanobubble
state should be stable due to the contact line pinning. However, many
experimental observations11,18,23−25 show the ripening of surface nanobubbles in which
one nanobubble grows at the expense of others. One can argue that
from the free-energy point of view, it is always favorable to form
one bubble instead of two because of the minimization of interface
area. Yet to reach the energetically favorable state, one first has
to overcome the contact line pinning barrier, which requires a (strong)
concentration gradient, which is absent in the case of identical radii
of curvature. Namely, according to Henry’s law, the concentration
of the gas at the interface of a bubble is directly proportional to
the pressure inside the bubble, which is a function of the radius
of the bubble as given by Laplace’s law. So from the macroscopic
point of view, no concentration gradient is present in the system
that can facilitate the transfer of particles from one nanobubble
to another.

Since there is no net flux of particles through
the bulk liquid,
the conclusion is that the only way gas molecules can get transferred
from one nanobubble to another is along the solid
substrate at the solid–liquid interface. Such a mechanism would
require a film layer of gas particles on the solid surface, which
can be achieved by increasing the interaction energy between gas and
solid particles, relative to the other interactions. To this end,
we have performed MD simulations in which we increased the ratio of
the solid–gas to solid–liquid interaction (ϵSG/ϵSL)
from 0.50 to 1.11 (for complete list of all the interactions, see Table 1). We simulated the
system for an increased ratio of ϵSG/ϵSL and observed that indeed after
a few nanoseconds, one nanobubble grows at the expense of another,
as can be seen in Figures 2b and 3 (also see Supplementary Movie S2). Figure 3 shows the number of gas particles as a function
of time in the two nanobubbles for various system pressures, or equivalently,
saturation concentrations Cs. Note that Cs is measured exactly in the same manner as in ref (14). The results shown in Figure 3 prove that the conclusion
that one bubble absorbs the gas content of the other is fairly robust
and occurs for a wide range of saturation concentrations.

Figure 3 Number of gas
particles inside the two nanobubbles as a function
of time when the contact lines of both bubbles are pinned for ϵSG/ϵSL =
1.11. Different lines indicate the simulation at various solubilities
which is indicated by the color bar. For all solubilities that we
studied, we find ripening of one bubble at the expense of the other.
Note that there is no systematic dependence of the time of the onset
of the instability on the solubility, and thus the color coding mainly
serves to identify the two bubbles (one growing and one shrinking)
which belong to one simulation.

In Figure 2b we
focus on a system with one particular solubility (Cs = 17.3 × 10–5). It can be clearly seen that even while the stability criteria
are met (the contact lines of both nanobubbles should remain pinned
and the radius of both nanobubbles should be equal),21 the system becomes unstable due to the gas leakage along
the surface, as we will demonstrate later. At t =
175 ns, a sudden jump is observed in the values of the contact angle,
the lateral length, and the radius of both nanobubbles. This sudden
jump in the values shows the “stick-jump” motion of
the contact line which was also observed during the dissolution of
a single surface nanobubble14 and the dissolution
of a microdrop in another liquid.26,27 The “stick-jump”
motion of the contact line is a clear indication of contact line pinning,
where the contact line prefers to stay on the chemical heterogeneities
and shifts from one pinning site to another during the dissolution
of a nanobubble.

As mentioned earlier, increasing the ratio
of ϵSG/ϵSL leads to
a formation of a gas layer near the solid surface. To show this more
clearly, we plotted the normalized concentration of gas particles
within a 5 particle diameter from the solid substrate, and indeed
the concentration of gas particles has increased by more than 10 times,
for an increased ratio ϵSG/ϵSL by a factor of around 2 times (see Figure 4). This gas layer
links the interface of the two nanobubbles like a tunnel that overcomes
the contact line pinning barrier and aids the system to reach the
energetically favorable state. We calculated the net movement of particles
between two nanobubbles for ϵSG/ϵSL = 1.11 and for 0.50. Figure 5a,b shows the net movement of particles in
the bulk liquid, along the surface and the total net movement of particles.
It is clear that almost all particles are transferred along the substrate
from one nanobubble to another when ϵSG/ϵSL = 1.11 (see Figure 5b). In contrast, Figure 5a shows that the
net flux is almost zero when ϵSG/ϵSL = 0.50. Inset of Figure 5b shows that during
the growth period, particles transferred at an exponential rate ∝ et/τ (where τ is
the time constant of the growth rate) from one nanobubble to other,
which demonstrates that the system is highly unstable. The exponential
dependence of rate on time shows the linear instability.

Figure 4 Variation of
normalized concentration of gas particles within 5
particle diameter of distance from the solid surface for Cs = 17.3 × 10–5. Here the concentration is normalized with the concentration of
gas particles in the bulk liquid far away from the solid surface.

Figure 5 Cumulative number of gas particles moving from
one nanobubble to
another as a function of time, when (a) ϵSG/ϵSL = 0.5 and (b) ϵSG/ϵSL =
1.11. Inset of (b) shows the cumulative transfer of gas particles
during the growth period on a semilog scale. It shows the exponential
growth of the nanobubble after destabilization with a time constant
τ = 28.9 ns. The red line indicates the number of particles
that are moving along the surface (that is, below a height of 5σLL), while the green line indicates the number
of particles moving in the bulk (that is, above a height of 5σLL, where σLL is the diameter of liquid particles).

In Figure 6 we show
the flux of the particles leaving the dissolving nanobubble near the
contact line as a function of the contact angle, where it is clearly
observed that the flux of the particles increases with decreasing
contact angle. This increase in the flux of the gas particles from
the dissolving nanobubble further demonstrates the instability of
the system.

Figure 6 Variation of flux of particles near the contact line of dissolving
nanobubble as a function of contact angle. Once the contact angle
of the pinned nanobubble becomes smaller, the flux along the surface
increases, signaling instability of the two bubble system.

Note that while we observe in Figure 3 that the onset of growth or
dissolution
differs for the various gas solubilities, this is mainly due to the
statistical fluctuations, that is, no specific trend with gas solubility
would be observed. For different realizations of the same numerical
experiment, but at different initial conditions, we also find that
the moment of the onset tstart of the instability is fluctuating (see Figure 7). While it would be interesting to measure
the distribution of tstart, and its dependence on the solubility, this is far beyond our computational
resources. In order to get statistically significant data one would
have to perform thousands of simulations at different initial conditions
for each solubility and then average, which would be extremely expensive
computationally.

nanobubbles
with time. Different line colors indicate the simulation at various
initial conditions at a saturation concentration Cs = 15.4 × 10–5 and ϵSG/ϵSL = 1.11.

Conclusions
To
summarize, we showed that a two-nanobubble system can remain
stable when the contact line is pinned, consistent with the theory,
as long as the gas–solid interaction (ϵSG) is low compared to the liquid–solid interaction (ϵSL). We find that upon increasing ϵSG relative to ϵSL, a film layer of gas particles at the surface forms a channel
which allows gas particles to transfer along the solid surface at
the solid–liquid interface and not via the bulk liquid. Our
simulations thus showed that the nanoscopic interaction with solid
surface can play a crucial role in the stability of two-nanobubble
systems, which hitherto has not been considered in the macroscopic
theories of surface nanobubbles. We showed that the system is unstable
for ϵSG/ϵSL = 1.1 and stable for ϵSG/ϵSL = 0.5. It will be interesting
to know the rough estimate of ϵSG/ϵSL at which the transition occurs. Figure 8a shows the number
of gas particles in both the nanobubbles as a function of time for
various values of ϵSG/ϵSL. It can be observed that the curves diverge
when ϵSG/ϵSL > 0.8, while the number of gas particles in each nanobubble
remains constant when ϵSG/ϵSL < 0.8, at least for the time that we
ran the simulation. We also plotted the concentration of gas particles
near the solid surface (see Figure 8b) which grows exponentially with the increase in ϵSG/ϵSL.
Although the gas layer near the solid surface enhances the transfer
of gas particles from one nanobubble to another, the onset of this
transfer varies quite a lot for different realizations (see Figures 3 and 7). This stochastic variability refrains us from claiming ϵSG/ϵSL =
0.8 as an exact boundary for the instability, as for some microscopic
conditions, the system may show stability or instability for the value
of ϵSG/ϵSL close to 0.8. Nevertheless ϵSG/ϵSL ≈ 0.8 can still
be considered as a rough estimate for the boundary of instability
based on our simulations. It would require an extensive number of
simulations performed at various initial conditions, if one wanted
to obtain better statistical estimates of the exact value of ϵSG/ϵSL beyond
which the system is unstable. This was not feasible for us, as these
MD simulations were computationally very expensive. In real systems,
surface heterogeneities along the “channel” between
the two bubbles will moreover modify the onset value.

Figure 8 (a) Number of gas particles
inside the two nanobubbles with time
for various values of ϵSG/ϵSL. (b) Normalized concentration of gas particles
within 5 particle diameter of distance from the solid surface as a
function of ϵSG/ϵSL. The inset shows the same data on a log linear
scale. It can be seen that the concentration of gas particles near
the surface increases exponentially with ϵSG/ϵSL. The value of ϵSG/ϵSL ∼
0.8 is estimated as a rough boundary between the region of a stable
and unstable two nanobubble system.

For the sake of connecting our simulations with real systems,
we
calculated the value of ϵSG/ϵSL for some real gas–solid–liquid
combinations with known interaction energy parameters and identified
the possible combinations where one can expect stable and unstable
two-nanobubble systems. For example, two nanobubbles of krypton gas
in water on a graphite surface will give the value of ϵSG/ϵSL as
0.98, which means this combination will give an unstable two-nanobubble
system. However, if we replace krypton with neon, then the value of
ϵSG/ϵSL becomes 0.46, which makes the two-nanobubble system stable,
according to our simulation results. The interaction energy parameters
used for the comparison are taken from refs (28 and 29).

Simulation
Methodology
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed
to simulate
the nanobubbles on a solid substrate for which we used the open source
code GROMACS.30 We used four types of particles
or molecules in our simulations: two types of solid particles (S and
SP), which remain fixed in a fcc lattice during the whole
simulation, and two types of moving particles, liquid (L) and gas
(G). The SP particles form the pinning sites and have different
interaction strengths toward the two types of moving particles. The
L particles form a bulk liquid phase (and hence we refer to these
as “liquid particles”) as the system temperature and
pressure are below the critical point of L particles, whereas the
G particles form a bulk gaseous phase (to which we refer as “gas
particles”) because the critical point for G particles is much
below the thermodynamic conditions at which we performed our simulations.

The interaction between the particles is described by a Lennard-Jones
potential: 2  where ϵij is the interaction strength between particles i and j, and σij is the characteristic size of the particles. The potential is truncated
at a relatively large cutoff radius (rc) of 5σLL. The
time step for updating the particle velocities and positions was set
at , where m is mass of the
liquid particles, and ϵLL is the
Lennard-Jones interaction parameter for the liquid particles. The
time step was chosen such that its value is sufficiently less than
the shortest time scale available in the system.31 Periodic boundary conditions were employed in all three
directions, which implies that the same solid substrate is also present
above the liquid layer.

The simulations were performed in an
NPT ensemble where the temperature
was fixed at 300 K, which is below the critical point for the Lennard-Jones
parameters (σLL, ϵLL) that we set for the liquid particles. Semi-isotropic
pressure coupling was used for maintaining constant pressure, which
means that the simulation box can expand or contract only in the z-direction to keep the pressure constant. This was done
to avoid the creation of gaps along the solid surface boundaries in
the x and y directions. The complete
set of Lennard-Jones parameters that we used in our simulations is
given in Table 1. The
typical system size was 5.6 × 60 × 22 nm3 in x, y, and z directions,
respectively, where the length of the z dimension
was changed during the simulation to maintain the pressure constant.

In the initial configuration, gas and liquid particles
were arranged
in an fcc lattice above the solid substrate. Initially, the liquid
near the surface was highly oversaturated with gas particles in order
to aid the bubble nucleation on the surface. This decreased the equilibration
time, which is around 108 time steps (around ∼18
ns). For simulations at different pressures, we used the final configuration
of the previous simulation as an initial configuration to save computation
time. In Figure 1 we
show a typical profile of two nanobubbles sitting next to each other
on a chemically heterogeneous surface.

The time-dependent average
density field of liquid particles was
then calculated, correcting for the center of mass motion in the lateral
direction. Quantities like the radius of curvature of the bubble and
the contact angle were obtained by fitting a circle to the isodensity
contour of 0.5 of the normalized density field, ρ*(r), defined as , where ρV and ρL are the bulk vapor and
liquid density, respectively. Since the liquid very near to the solid
substrate is subject to layering, we excluded the density field in
the range of 2σLL from the substrate
for the circular cap fitting.
