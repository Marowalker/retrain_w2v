Nanodomains
are intracellular foci which transduce signals between
major cellular compartments. One of the most ubiquitous signal transducers,
the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channel, is tightly clustered
within these nanodomains. Super-resolution microscopy has previously
been used to visualize RyR clusters near the cell surface. A majority
of nanodomains located deeper within cells have remained unresolved
due to limited imaging depths and axial resolution of these modalities.
A series of enhancements made to expansion microscopy allowed individual
RyRs to be resolved within planar nanodomains at the cell periphery
and the curved nanodomains located deeper within the interiors of
cardiomyocytes. With a resolution of ∼ 15 nm, we localized
both the position of RyRs and their individual phosphorylation for
the residue Ser2808. With a three-dimensional imaging protocol, we
observed disturbances to the RyR arrays in the nanometer scale which
accompanied right-heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension.
The disease coincided with a distinct gradient of RyR hyperphosphorylation
from the edge of the nanodomain toward the center, not seen in healthy
cells. This spatial profile appeared to contrast distinctly from that
sustained by the cells during acute, physiological hyperphosphorylation
when they were stimulated with a β-adrenergic agonist. Simulations
of RyR arrays based on the experimentally determined channel positions
and phosphorylation signatures showed how the nanoscale dispersal
of the RyRs during pathology diminishes its intrinsic likelihood to
ignite a calcium signal. It also revealed that the natural topography
of RyR phosphorylation could offset potential heterogeneity in nanodomain
excitability which may arise from such RyR reorganization.

Intracellular
calcium (Ca2+) nanodomains are the structural units of
fast intracellular
second messenger signaling mechanisms in eukaryotic cell types. Muscle,1−3 neuronal,4,5 and secretory cell types6 all rely on nanodomains, which allow coordinated release
of Ca2+ from intracellular compartments to evoke cellular
responses such as contraction, modulation of electrical excitability,
gene transcription, and secretion. Typical nanodomains can span up
to the order of 102 nanometers and can include the principal
Ca2+ release channels: the ryanodine receptors (RyR) and/or
inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R). These channels are often strategically
co-clustered to allow concerted opening and may be triggered both
by their neighbors (via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; CICR) or local signal transducers such as voltage-gated
L-type calcium channels (LCC) and phospholipase-c (PLC). Junctions
between the plasmalemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiac
muscle cells (also called cardiomyocytes) are among the most extensively
studied nanodomain types. Mounting evidence that the molecular constituents
of nanodomains may be reorganized7 or remodelled8,9 in life-threatening pathologies has emphasized the need for imaging
modalities which are capable of visualizing their molecular components.

The earliest measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) topology
of nanodomains were made using transmission and scanning electron
microscopy (EM).10,11 These data laid the foundation
for the current paradigm of signal transduction at the nanodomain
(see review on muscle).12 The large size
(∼2 MDa) and square shape of the RyR tetramer is distinctly
identifiable with newer EM techniques,13−15 albeit in larger nanodomains.
Fluorescence modalities, including super-resolution microscopy (e.g., techniques known by acronyms STED16 and dSTORM17) have
been instrumental in characterizing the clustering properties of RyRs.18,19 DNA-based point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography
(DNA-PAINT), implemented with total internal reflection fluorescence
(TIRF) microscopy, has resolved the positions of individual RyRs within
these clusters located near the cell surface.20 It has allowed molecular counts to be made of the regulatory protein
Junctophilin-2 which co-clusters with RyR.20 These visual insights now present new opportunities to build geometrically
realistic computational models of the local spatiotemporal patterns
of Ca2+ signaling.21

A
few key features in contemporary super-resolution techniques
limit their utility in characterizing nanodomains in primary cell
types. The majority of nanodomains (>80%) in cells such as cardiomyocytes
are found in deeper regions of the cell interiors, as deep as 5–15
μm from the cell surface (see Supplementary Figure S1 for a schematic illustration). Most single-molecule
imaging techniques suffer from poor localization accuracy at these
depths. An added complication is the complex curvatures of nanodomains
located deeper within the cell interiors (with diameters of 100–200
nm),9,15 as they wrap around tubular invaginations
of the plasmalemma (known as “t-tubules”; see Supplementary Figure S1). Techniques such as
STED8,19 and dSTORM have previously been used to
map these interior nanodomains. 3D dSTORM (with an axial resolution
of ∼65 nm) has shown the close relationship of these nanodomains
with the t-tubules;22 however, they have
only resolved the overall shapes of RyR clusters23,24 and not the intrinsic patterns of channel organization within these
clusters. The poorer axial resolutions of these modalities have prevented
the visualization of more intricate features and geometries of these
nanodomains. Quantification of RyRs and computational modeling of
RyR clusters have therefore relied upon assumptions that they form
continuous, crystalline arrays8,21−23 as seen in vitro. Recent DNA-PAINT and tomographic
EM data from near-surface nanodomains have shown that RyR self-assembly
may be amorphous, less continuous, and potentially dynamic depending
on the cell’s physiology.13,20 A modality
which offers both high in-plane and axial resolution is therefore
required. 3D implementations of techniques like dSTORM have been used
very effectively to resolve cellular features which are much finer
than these (e.g., 3D microtubule
networks,25,26 actin rings in neuronal axons,27 and centrioles26,28). However,
the anisotropic refractive index (RI; which varies around 1.38 and
1.414) in muscle,29 heavy intrinsic autofluorescence,
shallow imaging depth of these techniques, and suboptimal labeling
densities have limited their utility for 3D super-resolution mapping
of nanodomains.

Recent developments have presented a few potential
solutions. Combination
of adaptive optics,30 structured illumination
(SIM),31 or light-sheet techniques32 with 3D single marker localization approaches
have yielded sub-50 nm axial resolution while preserving in-plane
super-resolution. An alternative approach is the principle of expanding
the fluorescence marker topography of a labeled sample using a self-expanding
hydrogel, called expansion microscopy (ExM).33 This allows features which were smaller than the diffraction-limited
resolution of the microscopes to be resolved with no additional optical
modifications or marker localization protocols. The departure from
localization microscopy, compatibility with traditional far-field
imaging techniques (e.g., confocal
microscopy) and conventional marker probes (with protocols such as
protein-retention ExM)34 have allowed biologists
to consistently achieve a resolution-improvement by a factor of ∼4.34,35 Combining ExM with STED, SIM, or STORM has allowed this improvement
to be further enhanced.36−41 More recent reports have provided refined ExM protocols (called
X10 ExM42 and iterative-ExM43) which now allow >10-fold improvement in
resolution
by improving the volumetric expansion of the sample beyond the standard
expansion factor of 4. Over a short period of four years, ExM has
been applied in a wide range of studies, such as visualization of
the cytoskeletal and membrane structures of isolated and/or cultured
mammalian cells,35,44 RNA mapping with the use of expansion-fluorescence in situ hybridization,45 detection
of pathological biomarkers in human biopsy tissues,46 neural circuitry in whole brains,47 microbial systems,38,44 and model organisms.41,48−51 Such diversity in applications underscores a number of key improvements
that have been made to the hydrogel and probe chemistries and the
protocol of expansion,34 which makes the
principle of ExM adaptable for a range of cell and tissue types. The
more recent applications of ExM for making highly precise measurements
on true molecular-scale structures (e.g., 3D tubulin organization in centrioles,52 and subunit organization of the nuclear pore complex53) now present this technique as a validated tool
for making nanometer scale measurements.

We aimed to develop
an approach, based on ExM, to resolve not only
the positions of the individual RyRs but also their individual chemical
identities (site-specific phosphorylation) in cardiomyocytes. This
paper describes how we combined X10 microscopy with Airyscan (a protocol
which we call “enhanced expansion microscopy” or EExM)
to achieve a working resolution which we estimate to be ∼15
nm in-plane and ∼35 nm axially. We have exploited this 3D super-resolution
to map both the positions and the phosphorylation state of RyRs within
the three-dimensionally complex nanodomains, both at the surface and
interiors of cardiomyocytes at single-protein precision. This approach
has revealed nanometer-scale rearrangements of individual RyRs, deterioration
of nanodomain sizes, and the spatial patterns of phosphorylation of
RyR (at the residue Ser2808, which enhances RyR excitability and open
probability)54 in cardiomyocytes of a rodent
model with right ventricular failure. We detail how this level of
positional and biochemical information on individual RyRs can be exploited
for in silico inquiry of the structural basis of
nanodomain Ca2+ signaling at a spatial and temporal resolution
which has never been achieved experimentally.

Results
Evaluation
of EExM for Super-Resolution Imaging of Cell Interior
For
evaluating expansion microscopy as a method for imaging cell
interiors, we examined lattices of α-actinin called “z-discs”
(red-hot; Figure 1A)
and networks of microtubules (green) in the interior of cardiac muscle
cells. The highly uniform α-actinin lattices and their span
across the entire width of the cell (15–30 μm in thickness)
made the z-discs a useful intrinsic standard for comparing the resolution
of deconvolved confocal microscopy, two-dimensional (2D) dSTORM (under
HiLo oblique illumination),55 DNA-PAINT
(in TIRF), 4× EExM, and 10× EExM (Figure 1B, left to right). In longitudinal view of
the cells, each modality revealed a highly regular z-disc arrangement.
Magnified views showed a double-banded morphology within each z-disc
which was resolvable only with DNA-PAINT, 10× EExM, and, to a
lesser extent, with 4× EExM (Figure 1C). Line profiles of the α-actinin
distribution across the z-discs (as indicated in Figure 1C) in each type of data (Figure 1D) revealed three
key observations: The higher resolution techniques (e.g., dSTORM compared to confocal) generally reported
the α-actinin lattices to be narrower. Despite offering in-plane
resolution comparable to 4× EExM (∼40–50 nm), dSTORM
did not detect the double-banded morphology of α-actinin. Intensity
profiles of DNA-PAINT images were virtually identical to those acquired
in the cell interior with 10× EExM. The longitudinal separation
between the peaks (illustrated in red in the right panel of Figure 1D) was very similar
between DNA-PAINT and 10× EExM (Figure 1E; Means: 74.0 vs 70.1 nm).
This confirmed that the resolution achieved in these two modalities
is comparable (we estimate ∼15 nm in-plane). Based on a contemporary
model of the cardiac z-disc featuring up to six longitudinally arranged
parallel lattices of α-actinin56 (Figure 1F), we simulated
a likely antibody (Ab) labeling pattern in these cells (Supplementary Figure S2). A double-banded morphology
closely mimicking the experimental data was observed when DNA-PAINT
and EExM images of a gradient of Ab penetration at the z-disc lattice
were modeled. The simulation confirmed that the principal determinants
of the observed labeling pattern were the effective lateral and axial
resolution of ∼15 and 35 nm, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3).

25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles. (F) This double-layer morphology
was consistent with a model of the z-disc consisting of six parallel
layers of α-actinin (green) anchoring actin filaments (blue);
the two outermost layers are optimally labeled with Abs (orange; see Supplementary Figure S2). (G) Maximum intensity
projections of a 3D 10× EExM volume of α-actinin (gray)
and α-tubulin (colored for depth, indicated in μm) acquired
near the center of the cell (at a sample depth of ∼ 50 μm)
illustrate the capability of 10× EExM to image cellular regions
far from the surface. (H) Magnified region of the same data illustrates
the tessellation between microtubule bundles with the z-discs within
∼50 nm, illustrated with (I) overlaid intensity profiles of
a region (dotted line in inset). Scale bars: (A) 5 μm; (B and
H) 1 μm; (C) 400 nm; and (G) 2 μm (EExM scale bars adjusted
to expansion factor).

To demonstrate the enhancement that 10× EExM offers
in imaging
cell interiors, we illustrate the nanoscale 3D relationship between
the α-actinin lattices of the z-discs (gray) and the microtubule
network (color-coded 3D geometry traced by α-tubulin in Figure 1G; magnified view
in 1H) throughout a 5 μm-thick volume of the cell, at a depth
of ∼5 μm from the cell surface. A line profile illustrates
how two intertwined microtubule bundles (black line) are tessellated
at ∼50 nm of the two outer layers of the α-actinin lattices
of the z-disc. We used the regularity of the z-disc spacing (a feature
known as “sarcomeric length”; SL) along the length of
the cell to confirm isotropy of expansion in these hydrogels (Supplementary Figure S4A–C). The consistency
in the double-banded morphology in α-actinin labeling was used
as evidence that the spatial measurements were unaffected by gel-to-gel
variations in the expansion factor (Supplementary Figure S4D–F).

RyR Arrays within Intracellular Nanodomains
Resolved with 10×
EExM
The RyR organization within near-surface nanodomains
was examined with 10× EExM and compared with DNA-PAINT as the
current benchmark.20 A clustered labeling
pattern was observed across the surface regions visualized with both
techniques (Figure 2A-i). In magnified view, 10× EExM revealed punctate labeling
densities (Figure 2A-ii) with strong resemblance to the patterns seen in DNA-PAINT.
In dSTORM images at depths of ∼10 μm inside the cells,
the RyR labeling appeared more clearly banded (Figure 2B-i). Closer examination of both dSTORM and
10× EExM data revealed clusters which were curved and/or elongated
(Figure 2B-ii), however
dSTORM data did not reveal any substructure within the cluster regions
(left). The 10× EExM images reported a punctate labeling morphology
of RyRs (right), similar to that seen near the cell surface. With
a simulation, we established that the punctate appearance of clusters
was enabled by and consistent with the superior in-plane and axial
resolution offered by 10× EExM of ∼ 15 nm and 35–40
nm, respectively (Supplementary Figure S5). A maximum-intensity projection of RyR labeling, color-coded for
depth throughout a 1 μm-deep cell volume, illustrates the complexity
of the 3D topography of RyRs visualized now with 10× EExM (Figure 2C). Figure 2D-i illustrates the flat topology
of cell surface RyR arrays (left) with 3D isosurface visualization
(middle), color-coded for the axial (z) depth. This topology was consistent
with an RyR (orange in schematic, Figure 2D-i, right) alignment that is parallel to
the surface plasmalemma (cyan). The RyR clusters in the cell interior
regions (maximum-intensity projections in Figure 2D-ii and -iii, left) revealed nanodomains
which curved around local t-tubule membranes. Depending on whether
the cluster was imaged either end-on (Figure 2D-ii) or side-on (Figure 2D-iii), relative to the image planes, the
depth-encoded 3D visualization showed distinct gradation of the colors
of the isosurface (Figure 2D-ii and -iii, middle). The approximated orientations of the
RyR array (orange) and the tubular plasmalemma (cyan) are shown schematically
on the right.

nanodomains located in the cell interiors. (B-ii) Magnified views

orthogonal to the axis of curvature. Shown are the in-plane view of
the nanodomains (left), surface rendered 3D 10× EExM data, color

of the RyR cluster sizes in the cell interior nanodomains show a Mean
± SEM of 8.23 ± 0.51 RyRs/cluster; n =
11 cells, 1912 clusters. The distributions of the surface cluster
sizes, as estimated with both DNA-PAINT (Mean ± SEM of 7.87 ±
0.39 RyRs/cluster; n = 12 cells, 3209 clusters) and
the surface and interior clusters imaged 10× EExM, were similar
as illustrated by the dot-plots overlaid with the box and whiskers
plots (inset; p > 0.05 in Bonferroni-adjusted
Mann–Whitney
tests). (F) The distribution of NND in interior nanodomains with ≥5
RyRs (blue) showed a mean of 45.41 ± 0.75 nm. The distribution
of 3ND (red) for the same RyR nanodomains had a long rightward tail
(mean ± SD: 73.74 ± 14.28 nm). Overlaid with the 3ND histogram
of the cell interior (gray, inset) is the equivalent distribution
for subsurface RyR nanodomains (green), which was more left-shifted.
Scale bars: (A-i and B-i) 1 μm; (A-ii, B-ii, C, and D) 50 nm.
Error bars in plots: SD.

For further analysis of the positions of the punctate RyR
labeling
densities, we used an algorithm which determined the in situ 3D centroids of each RyR punctum. Supplementary Figure S5 visually illustrates the RyR puncta of a curved cluster
and their corresponding 3D centroids. The spatial organization of
these puncta (see 3D data in Supplementary Figure S6) were similar to the selection of 3D-rendered tomographic
EM data published previously from rat cardiomyocytes.14 In the interior clusters, an approximately exponential
distribution of RyR cluster size was observed (Figure 2E, main panel; mean of ∼8.23 RyRs/cluster).
Many of the puncta were observed either as solitary or small (<5
RyRs) clusters both in the cell interior and near-surface regions.
The cluster sizes in the cell interior strongly resembled the size
distribution in near-surface nanodomains (mean of ∼8.98 RyR/cluster; Figure 2E, inset). A dot-plot
analysis illustrated that the counts of RyR in each near-surface cluster
were very similar between the 10× EExM and DNA-PAINT data (mean
∼7.84 RyR/cluster; blue in Figure 2E inset). We further examined the RyR assembly
pattern in larger (≥4 RyRs) clusters with histograms of the
nearest-neighbor distance (NND; blue in Figure 2F) and the average distance between the 3
nearest neighbors for each RyR (3ND; red in Figure 2F). The NNDs, a measure of the co-clustering
between individual receptors, followed an approximately Gaussian distribution
with a mean of ∼45 nm which was consistent with previous measurements
of center-to-center spacings between RyRs made with tomographic EM.13 The 3NDs, reporting the average spacings between
RyRs in a given array, were more variable and produced a histogram
with a rightward tail and a mean of ∼73 nm. This contrasted
with the 3NDs histogram for near-surface nanodomains (gray barplot
overlaid with the interior 3ND histogram, shown in green, in the inset
of Figure 2F) which
showed less variability and a shorter tail (mean ∼64 nm). The
NND and the 3ND distributions for near-surface clusters provided an
additional point of comparison between the measurements between DNA-PAINT
and 10× EExM and showed that the shapes of the two distributions
were independent of the method (Supplementary Figure S7).

Adaptation of EExM for Visualizing RyR Rearrangement
in Pathology
RyR clusters are susceptible to remodelling,
particularly in pathologies
of the heart such as atrial fibrillation.8 Exploiting the enhanced resolution of 10× EExM, we examined
changes in the structure of RyR nanodomains in right ventricular (RV)
myocytes of rats displaying RV failure, following treatment with monocrotaline
(MCT). At the cell surface, the clustering pattern of RyR labeling
was broadly comparable between control (Figure 3A) and MCT-RV cells (Figure 3B), however, solitary puncta were more abundantly
observed in the latter (arrowheads). Compared to control cells (Figure 3C), RyR clusters
near the surface of MCT-RV cells (Figure 3D) visually appeared smaller; many regions
contained single puncta. Closer examination allowed us to characterize
changes within the nanodomains which accompany this
pathology. In the interiors of both MCT-RV and control cells, the
RyR clusters followed a more banded organization which reflected the
organization of the sarcomeres (Figure 3E,F). However, clusters in MCT-RV were smaller and
contained visibly fewer RyRs (Figure 3G,H).

rearrangement

ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from (A) control and (B) MCT-RV,
which featured noticeably more frequent solitary RyR puncta (arrowheads).
Magnified views of (C) control and (D) MCT-RV nanodomains at the cell
surface revealed a visibly sparse dispersed RyR arrangement within
the nanodomain areas. RyR nanodomains in the interior of (E) control
cells and (F) MCT-RV cells. Magnified view of (G) RyR nanodomains
in control cells featured closely clustered RyRs tracing out their
curved topography, which contrasted with (H) regions in MCT-RV cell
featuring smaller and less discernible nanodomains. (I) NND histogram
of interior nanodomains in MCT-RV cells (gray-shaded) featured a larger
mean ± SEM (51.65 ± 4.45 nm), a right-shifted primary maximum
at ∼45 nm, and a secondary maximum at ∼85 nm (black
arrows) compared to control (blue; mode in blue arrow; mean: 45.41
± 0.76 nm; p = 0.001, df = 19 cells; Bonferroni-adjusted
Mann–Whitney test). (J) Histograms showing a rightward shift

73.74 ± 14.27 nm; p = 0.0002, df = 19, Bonferroni-adjusted
Mann–Whitney test). (K) Dot-plots comparing the cluster size
distributions in near-surface and interior nanodomains show a diminished
mean and the range of RyR counts in individual clusters in both near-surface
(p < 0.0001; df = 20) and interior (p < 0.0001; df = 19) of MCT-RV cells compared to control. (L) Schematic
illustrating how cluster fragmentation in MCT-RV may coincide with
the increased NND and 3ND (green arrows) for some RyRs. Scale bars:
(A, B, E, and F) 1 μm and (C, D, G, and H) 50 nm. Error bars
in plots: SD.

To assess the nature
of the mutual reorganization of RyR channels,
we compared the NNDs and the 3NDs of RyRs in the larger clusters (≥4
RyRs) of control and MCT-RV cells. In contrast to the narrow unimodal
NND distribution for RyRs in interior nanodomains of control cells
(mode ∼ 40 nm; Figure 3I, blue), the MCT-RV NND distribution (gray, overlaid) featured
two peaks at ∼45 nm and ∼90 nm, respectively. A similar
trend was observed in RyRs in near-surface nanodomains of MCT-RV cells
(Supplementary Figure S8). This observation
suggested that at least a small subset of RyRs had dissociated from
their default clustering pattern. This hypothesis was further supported
by the longer rightward tails observed in the 3ND histograms (Figure 3J and Supplementary Figure S7), which related to RyR
clusters with looser arrangement of receptors.

Confirming the
visual observations of smaller RyR clusters, coupled
with higher abundance of solitary RyRs in MCT-RV, we observed an ∼40%
reduction in the mean number of RyRs in MCT-RV clusters compared to
control in both cell interior and near-surface nanodomains (Figure 3K). The smaller cluster
size is also compatible with the hypothesis of nanodomain fragmentation
during the disease (Figure 3L), leading to greater variability in the RyR-RyR distances.

Mapping Phosphorylation Status of RyRs
In addition
to spatial remodelling, RyR nanodomains are also known to undergo
types of biochemical remodelling both in healthy physiology and in
disease. These include the phosphorylation of RyR at Ser2808. With
two-color 10× EExM, we mapped the Ser2808 phosphorylation state
of RyR (with an anti-pSer2808 Ab; purple in Figure 4A) relative to the positions of individual
RyRs (gray) in near-surface and interior nanodomains of rat cardiac
muscle cells. Magnified views of both types of nanodomains showed
that punctate pSer2808 labeling densities either overlapped or closely
tessellated with RyRs consistently (Figure 4B). These data (inset, Figure 4C) were used to localize the centroids of
the RyR (gray circles) and pSer2808 puncta (purple). Individual RyRs
were recorded as “phosphorylated” if their centroid
consisted of any detectable pSer2808 labeling within a 30 nm 3D radius
(Figure 4C). Approximately
1–3% of the pSer2808 puncta were not detected in association
with RyRs (arrowhead).

near (i) the cell surface and (ii) cell interior visually illustrates
that punctate pS2808 (purple) labeling densities, observed in fewer
numbers, follow either close overlap or proximity with RyR puncta
(gray). (C) The centroids of the RyR (gray) and pS2808 puncta (purple)
were localized and paired with the nearest RyR within a 30 nm 3D distance
(dashed line) to identify RyRs which were phosphorylated at the Ser2808
site. Raw data of region illustrated in inset. An example of unpaired
pS2808 marker is shown with an arrowhead. Magnified views of the overlays
of subsurface nanodomains in cells from the right ventricles of (D)
control and (E) MCT rats show a minor fraction of RyRs which associate
pS2808 labeling. The same comparison in the cell interior regions
illustrates a similar fraction of RyRs with Ser2808 phosphorylation
in (F) control nanodomains, while a greater proportion of RyRs, despite
smaller cluster size, coincide with pS2808 labeling in (G) MCT-RV
nanodomains. (H) Percentage histograms of the mean fraction of RyRs
determined to be phosphorylated at Ser2808 (Pphos) in the subsurface nanodomains containing ≥4 RyRs
illustrate near-identical distributions (mean ± SD of Pphos of 0.31 ± 0.10 and 0.30 ± 0.12; p > 0.05; df = 20 cells; Bonferroni-corrected Mann–Whitney t test) for both control (purple) and MCT-RV (blue). (I)
Cell interior nanodomains in MCT-RV (blue; 0.45 ± 0.07) showed
a rightward shifted Pphos distribution
compared to control (purple; 0.27 ± 0.09 ; p = 0.022, df = 19). Pphos distributions
for both subsurface and interior nanodomains appeared to show a right-shift
in control cells stimulated with isoproterenol and simultaneous electrical
pacing at 1 Hz (insets). (J) Histograms of the 2D pS2808 localization
density as a function of the distance within the subsurface nanodomain
relative to its boundary in control (purple line), stimulated (black),
and MCT-RV (blue) cells. (K-i) In control cells, RyRs phosphorylated
at Ser2808 are located, on average, uniformly throughout the nanodomain.
(K-ii) Stimulation with isoproterenol and electrical pacing appeared
to approximately double the pS2808 density uniformly across the nanodomain.
(K-iii) In MCT-RV, a gradient of pS2808 density is seen from the edge
of the nanodomain inward, allowing a subdomain of potentiated RyRs
to be maintained at the center of the nanodomain (circle). Scale bars:
(A) 200 nm, (B–G) 50 nm.

We visually compared the localizations of RyRs which were
phosphorylated
at Ser2808 within near-surface nanodomains of control and MCT-RV cells
(Figure 4D,E, respectively)
to find that only a subset was phosphorylated. As a point of comparison,
we examined the pSer2808 labeling at the near surface nanodomains
in control cells which were stimulated with electrical pacing and
the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol, which is known to
evoke acute intrinsic hyperphosphorylation of the RyRs.57 The densities of pSer2808 labeling in these
RyR clusters were noticeably higher (Supplementary Figure S9). In cell interior nanodomains (Figure 4F,G), the density of pSer2808
labeling appeared visually comparable for control and MCT-RV cells.
Given that RyR clusters were smaller in MCT-RV, the visually identifiable
proportion of phosphorylated RyRs was higher in these cells. Histograms
of the proportion of phosphorylated RyRs in each cluster (containing
≥4 RyRs; Pphos) between control
(purple; Figure 4H)
and MCT-RV (blue) cells were comparable (mean ∼0.31 for control
and ∼0.30 for MCT-RV) and consisted of similar modes (∼0.24
and ∼0.28, respectively). Few clusters featured either no or
complete phosphorylation. A similar distribution was observed for
cell interior nanodomains of control cells (purple in Figure 4I; mean ∼0.27 and mode
∼0.16); however, the distribution for Pphos in MCT-RV cells was right-shifted (blue; mean ∼0.45
and mode ∼0.42). This shift in Pphos closely mimicked the shape of the equivalent histogram analyses
performed on near-surface and interior RyR clusters of control cells
(insets of Figure 4H,I) which were stimulated with isoproterenol and electrical pacing
(means ∼0.42 and ∼0.57, respectively).

To investigate
whether the likelihood of RyR phosphorylation was
dependent on the location within the nanodomain, we plotted the density
of pSer2808 puncta against the distance from the edge of the RyR cluster.
A near-uniform density was observed in regions ≥50 nm inside
of the cluster-boundary of control cells (purple; Figure 4J). In a simulation, we observed
that such a uniform density profile is consistent with a random uniform
probability of RyR phosphorylation throughout the cluster (Supplementary Figure S10). This density profile
appeared to be uniformly amplified by a factor of ∼2 when control
cells were stimulated as above (gray; Figure 4J). However, in MCT-RV cells, the pSer2808
puncta density showed a distinct gradient extending from the cluster
boundary to the center. This density-distance analysis suggested that
healthy cells, when under higher β-stimulation, allow a uniform
increase in RyR phosphorylation at Ser2808 throughout each nanodomain
(Figure 4K-i and -ii).
Despite nanodomains being smaller and/or fragmented, they typically
foster a higher density of phosphorylated RyR at the center of the
clusters in MCT-RV cells (Figure 4K-iii).

Simulation of Nanodomain Calcium Dynamics
Given the
positions of individual RyRs and their respective phosphorylation
state, we investigated the likely spatiotemporal patterns of Ca2+ release in these nanodomains determined purely from these
structural considerations. Two spatially discretized models based
on the RyR and pSer2808 data of flat, approximately median-sized near-surface
nanodomains were constructed: one from control (Figure 5A) and the other from MCT-RV (Figure 5B). The centroid positions
of each RyR (circles Figure 5C,D) and the phosphorylation identity (yellow for phosphorylated)
were marked in each example. Ten independent simulations of the temporal
pattern of the local cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in the nanodomain
cleft in Ca2+ signals (known as ‘Ca2+ sparks’) were performed for control (Figure 5E) and MCT-RV (Figure 5F) examples. The control cluster consistently
gave rise to sparks with amplitudes of 30–80 μM [Ca2+]. By comparison, the MCT-RV nanodomains featured Ca2+ release which lacked the temporal synchronization and development
into the full temporal profile of sparks (also see Supplementary Movie). The simulated image series of [Ca2+] in the control (Figure 5G) and MCT-RV (Figure 5H) nanodomains allowed visual examination of likely
spatiotemporal pattern of Ca2+ release at resolutions of
10 nm and 0.1 ms. In control nanodomains, we often observed Ca2+ release which was seeded by individual or subgroups of phosphorylated
RyRs in the earliest phases of the spark (i.e. at
∼10–20 ms; Figure 5G-ii). These events appeared to cumulatively recruit
their nearest neighbors (Figure 5G iii-vi) via CICR,
typifying the “triggered saltatory” mechanism of initiating
Ca2+ sparks hypothesized previously.18 A similar triggering was observed in MCT-RV clusters (Figure 5H-ii); however, the
recruitment of their neighboring RyRs was neither cumulative nor complete.
Dephosphorylation of the RyRs in the MCT-RV example, while maintaining
all other parameters, showed complete failure of the nanodomain to
release Ca2+ (Supplementary Movie). This suggested that RyR hyperphosphorylation at Ser2808 could
serve to offset the loss of the nanodomain’s excitability during
RyR rearrangement.

Figure 5 Simulating geometrically realistic spatiotemporal patterns
of Ca2+ release based on 10× EExM data. Shown are
examples
of RyR (gray) and pS2808 (purple) labeling in approximately median-sized
nanodomains of control (A) and MCT-RV cells (B). The centroids of
the receptors were localized (circles), and receptors identified as
phosphorylated were marked (yellow circles) for the control (C) and
MCT-RV (D) clusters. A series of local Ca2+ sparks, overplotted
as the time course of the local change in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (shown in μM), illustrates how the control (E)
geometry facilitates more consistent and pronounced Ca2+ release events compared to that in the MCT-RV cluster (F). Spatiotemporal
visualization of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ (color scale shown
in μM) at a spatial resolution of 10 nm in the early phases
of the Ca2+ sparks illustrates progressive recruitment
of RyRs, more readily among those phosphorylated at S2808, in the
control nanodomain (G) compared to MCT-RV. The latter shows recruitment
of RyR openings, however, often failed to achieve cluster-wide activation
in the first 20 ms of the spark. Scale bars: 50 nm. Time stamps in
(G and H) shown in ms.

Discussion
10× EExM has allowed us to map the
3D positions of dyadic
RyRs in nanodomains deep within the interiors of cardiomyocytes with
a resolution which matches that offered by DNA-PAINT for imaging 2D
nanodomains at the cell periphery.20 This
advancement is enabled by a superior in-plane and axial resolution
over existing benchmarks such as 3D dSTORM data published recently.22 With this, we have observed both acute and chronic
changes in the phosphorylation of the RyRs within the nanodomain and
molecular-scale repositioning of RyRs coinciding with the RV failure
pathology.

ExM as a Quantitative True-Molecular-Scale Imaging Technique
Our implementation of 10× EExM examined the components of
Ca2+ nanodomains, particularly in the cell interior. We
have demonstrated its superior resolution compared to established
imaging techniques such as dSTORM and 4× EExM (Figure 1B,C) by mapping 3D cytoskeletal
components in cardiomyocyte interiors. With near-surface imaging of
both α-actinin lattices and RyR clusters, we showed that the
resolution achieved by 10× EExM almost matches that of DNA-PAINT.20 A notable gain in combining the X10 microscopy
protocol of Truckenbrodt et al.42 with 3D Airyscan is a distinct improvement in the axial
resolution to ∼35 nm. Simulations of the 10× EExM imaging
process using two models of curved nanodomains—one of a large
RyR cluster and the other of a cluster with a narrower radius of curvature
(Supplementary Figure S5)—have confirmed
that the 10× EExM imaging protocol is particularly suited for
imaging RyRs (spaced ∼40 nm apart) within curved nanodomains.
They revealed that the detection accuracy of single RyRs was better
where the working resolution was ∼15 nm in-plane and ∼35
axially. Accuracy of aligning fine structures in the image with multichannel
10× EExM is further subject to chromatic alignment of the imaging
channels. With the Airyscan imaging system that we used, we found
that this alignment error was 10–13% of the effective resolution
achieved (see Estimation of the Point Spread
Function and Effective Resolution section for details).

As an imaging protocol, 10× EExM was difficult to master initially
due a drop in the RyR labeling intensity equivalent to the cube of
the expansion factor. However, four key features of our experimental
design permitted the single-RyR level of sensitivity to be achieved
during the imaging. First, the digestion and removal of the cell material
in ExM renders the RI of the sample homogeneous, as described before.37 While dSTORM experiments for mapping RyR23,24 used an 80% glycerol mounting medium to reduce the intracellular
RI inhomogeneities, no active clearing approach such as this was adopted.
Second, the clearing also led to a near-complete removal of the autofluorescence
arising from the intrinsic contractile proteins, mitochondrial NADPH,
and flavin co-enzymes, which occupy >40% of the cardiomyocytes’
cytoplasmic volume (discussed by Larcher et al.).58 For EExM, this enhanced the detection of low
marker densities substantially. This was a clear advantage over our
previous DNA-PAINT and dSTORM experiments18,20 where marker localization accuracy was limited considerably by cellular
autofluorescence.59 Third, our selection
of bleach-resistant fluorophores, Alexa488 and Janelia549 in particular,
also allowed greater consistency in retention and detection of RyRs
during the highly oxidative gelation step of ExM42 and Airyscan imaging, respectively. Finally, the choice
of the Airyscan method over confocal microscopy for imaging the sample
further enhanced the effective resolution improvement and greater
photon collection efficiency enabled by its sensitive array detector
and the absence of a physical pinhole.60

To validate 10× EExM as an accurate tool for measuring
intracellular
structures, we performed two key tests to confirm that (i) the expansion
of the cellular structures was isotropic and (ii) the effect of gel-to-gel
variations in expansion factor (∼ 7–10.5) on the standard
deviation of the measurements was minimal (Supplementary Figure S4). There are no ideal calibration standards (e.g., DNA origamis which would expand in
proportion to the structures of interest) for these tests currently;
however, we used the periodicity of the myocytes’ sarcomeres
and fixed-width of z-discs as intrinsic reporters of local gel expansion.
The standard deviation of <10% was well in the range of the biological
variations of these structures observed previously,61 providing us with assurance on the above requirements.
The similar measurements in the cluster size (Figure 2) NND and 3ND (Supplementary Figure S7) between DNA-PAINT and 10× EExM provided additional
confirmation that the spatial calibrations of the expansion factor
and the isotropy of expansion translate well to the scale of RyR clustering
(∼ 30–80 nm). As a super-resolution approach for examining
and quantifying structures with 3D complexity, therefore, 10×
EExM presents a useful and highly reproducible technique. A comparison
with respect to the ease of use of 10× EExM versus high-end localization microscopy methods does not allow a clear-cut
conclusion. The 5 day sample preparation protocol and an as yet unproven
suitability for examining tissue, particularly heart tissue containing
high densities of collagen,42 are still
limiting factors that can reduce the practicality of 10× EExM
for some experimental settings. On the other hand, the purely chemical
approach of EExM is likely more accessible to cell biologists who
often have limited expertise in instrumentation development and the
intricacies of fluorophore photochemistry, as argued previously.62

3D and Chemical Topography of Nanodomains
By applying
10× EExM to image RyR labeling in rat ventricular myocytes, we
observed puncta, whose identities as single RyRs have been confirmed
both visually (benchmarking against DNA-PAINT; Figure 2A)20 and quantitatively
(by cluster sizes and RyR NND and 3ND measurements; Supplementary Figure S7). The RyR arrays patterns observed
with both methods are irregular and, therefore, consistent with the
noncrystalline cluster self-assembly which we proposed previously
based on near-surface DNA-PAINT data (see Supplementary Figure S2B
of refs (20 and 63)). This direct approach
to RyR counting made the in situ analysis of RyR
clustering more straightforward than indirect protocols (based on
event density22,24 or frequency20 calibrations) used in dSTORM and DNA-PAINT experiments
previously. The superior 3D data have allowed clear visualization
of the nonplanar topology of interior nanodomains (Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S5). These data have allowed optical comparisons between
the fine structure of near-surface and interior nanodomains. Overcoming
the uncertainties in RyR counting with techniques like dSTORM,18,23 the 10× EExM data suggest that the two types of nanodomains
are similar in size and receptor organization pattern (confirmed by
measurements of NND).

An advantage of the multicolor capability
of ExM is the ability to map the phosphorylation state of the individual
RyRs in situ. The anti-pSer2808 is a well-established
antibody and has been used extensively to characterize physiological64,65 and pathological66 RyR phosphorylation.
In our analysis, we observed that ∼30% of the RyRs are phosphorylated
at Ser2808 at the basal (unstimulated) state. Direct comparisons of
the cluster-specific Pphos between near-surface
and interior nanodomains provided both visual and quantitative evidence
that basal level phosphorylation at Ser2808 is comparable between
the two cellular regions. It is well characterized that Ser2808 can
be modified primarily by protein kinase A (PKA) but also by calmodulin
kinase II (CAMKII),67 commonly under the
control of intracellular signaling cascades downstream of β-adrenergic
stimulation, to enhance the RyR open probability. The local densities
of pSer2808 measured throughout the near-surface nanodomains in control
myocytes (Figure 4J)
may therefore reflect a basal “tuning” to maintain near-uniform
local excitability of RyRs throughout the nanodomain. In an additional
iterative simulation which artificially inverted the RyR phosphorylation
pattern (supplementary Figure S11), we
observed a higher-than-normal likelihood of the nanodomain to ignite
full-blown Ca2+ sparks, originating from the locations
of pSer2808. This suggested that the nanodomain’s basal pSer2808
tuning may encourage a uniform profile of RyR excitability throughout
the nanodomain, potentially as a counter against geometrically determined
heterogeneity, proposed in previous models.21 We note that the excitability of individual RyRs is functionally
regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites on each of the four RyR
subunits, physical interactions with regulators such as FK506 binding
protein 12.668 and junctophilin-269 on their cytoplasmic domains. Mapping all of
these regulators simultaneously may not be achievable given the bulky
size (and potential steric competition) of current probes; however,
this would enable a more comprehensive simulation of the intrananodomain
heterogeneities in RyR excitability.

We recognize that the in situPphos values estimated
for larger nanodomains through our
imaging data (Figure 4H,I; ∼30% for control myocytes) are lower than that reported
by Western Blot analysis of denatured cardiac homogenates using the
same antibody (∼69%).70 The differences
in the measurements are not clear, but likely to be methodological,
either relating to potentially incomplete labeling of pSer2808 in situ or an unaccounted selectivity to phosphorylated
RyRs in the membrane fractionation methods used in in vitro studies.70 We note that the proportional
increase in Pphos (by ∼50%) that
we see under β-adrenergic stimulation (with electrical pacing
in the presence of isoproterenol) closely reproduces the in
vitro measurements on pSer2808 made by Huke and Bers.65

Modification and Redistribution of Ryanodine
Receptors in Physiology
and Pathology
Ser2808 is only one of a handful of PKA and
CAMKII targets on the RyR,67 and it is
possible that there is little/no relationship between RyR self-assembly
pattern and pSer2808. In our experiments, control cells undergoing
stimulation showed uniform phosphorylation of RyR throughout the nanodomain,
and there was no detectable difference in phosphorylation pattern
between near-surface and interior nanodomains. RyR phosphorylation
patterns appear different in MCT-RV cells. Interior nanodomains preferentially
show hyperphosphorylation at the basal state. The higher systemic β-adrenergic
stimulation experienced by these animals71 and the chronic (over a few weeks) upregulation of PKA expression
in MCT-RV cells72 could well explain this
observation. The exclusivity of this phenotype to interior nanodomains
however contrasts clearly with the acute effects of β-adrenergic
stimulation observed in control cells. This may simply reflect the
broad changes in β-adrenergic intracellular signaling mechanisms
which accompany the disease.72 Despite
the preservation of Pphos in peripheral
nanodomains, a redistribution of pSer2808 is seen (Figure 4J,K). This may be the likely
result of an unravelling nanodomain membrane structure which can allow
(i) a spatial redistribution of the AKAP scaffold proteins which harbor
PKA within the nanodomain,73 (ii) increased
access of phosphatases to the peripheral regions of the nanodomain,
(iii) or both.

In pathology, we observe a remodelling of the
nanodomains which feature a less closely packed RyR-RyR pattern with
increased inter-receptor distances, both near the cell surface and
in interior regions. This change appeared to be most prominent in
the cardiomyocytes of the RV. NND and 3ND measurements in the LV (column
4 of Supplementary Figure S7), by comparison,
more closely resembled the distributions in the control cells. The
curvatures and the extended shapes of the RyR cluster in the cell
interior were less apparent. The superior resolution of 10× EExM
has provided a molecular-scale view of the RyR cluster fragmentation,
first reported very recently74 using STED
and dSTORM at resolutions of 40–80 nm. The 10× EExM data
presented in Figure 3 therefore report the smallest spatial scale at which pathological
remodelling of heart has been observed to date.

Simulation
of Nanoscale Signaling Based on Super-Resolution
Data
The simulation (Figure 5) developed from 10× EExM utilizes experimentally
determined positions and biochemical states of individual RyRs to
interpret intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In Figure 5E,F, we demonstrate its utility,
particularly in examining one of the nanodomains’ fundamental
features–the ability to produce fast and reproducible Ca2+ sparks. Direct comparisons of the control RyR arrangement
with the disease phenotype relative to the Ca2+ revealed
the diminishing coupling between adjacent RyRs as they are dispersed.
This manifested in both failed Ca2+ sparks as well as unsynchronized
opening of individual RyRs within the nanodomain (Figure 5H). While the diminished amplitude
of the sparks may be explained by the smaller number of receptors
in the diseased nanodomains, the higher variability in the likelihood
of evoking a full Ca2+ spark is striking (Figure 5F). Failed Ca2+ sparks
in this spatial scale are unlikely to be detectable with the current
state-of-the-art Ca2+ imaging techniques which have to
contend with a number of limitations which associate contemporary
Ca2+ imaging methods. These limitations include high resting
cytoplasmic [Ca2+], diffusion of Ca2+ indicator
dye, as well as Ca2+, poor photon efficiency particularly
when using a pinhole-based detector and the diffraction limited resolution
of the imaging system.75 Spatially accurate
models such as this are therefore a useful approach to studying the
functional phenotype of nanodomain signaling in disease.

Limitations
Our application of 10× EExM has come
with a few noteworthy limitations. While we characterized the isotropy
of expansion and reliability of the expansion factors estimated in
the scales >70 nm, we were limited by the lack of a known calibrant
in the range of 10–30 nm. Cross-validation of RyR NND measurements
against DNA-PAINT was a useful workaround; however, a DNA origami
(which, at present, has been proposed in a preprint manuscript)76 or similar spatial calibration standard which
reports the gel expansion in this spatial scale is needed. For now,
we find assurance in our approach which is similar to the analyses
performed by others using features of intrinsic ultrastructures (e.g., the circularity of the cross-section
of centrioles).52 The single RyR positions
detected from the 3D 10× EExM data were likely to be limited
by two factors. The poorer axial resolution which, as we demonstrate
in the 3D simulation, could lead to errors or loss of detection in
∼5% of the receptors, particularly in regions where RyRs are
aligned orthogonal to the image-plane (Supplementary Figure S5). Achieving ∼10× expansion is an important
determinant because we show in the same simulation that approximately
halving of this effective resolution leads to ∼30% drop in
the detection accuracy. Second, the binding efficiency of the antibody
probes is likely to be limiting. While RyR counts within clusters
were comparable to those achieved with DNA-PAINT (and two different
Abs) previously,20 there may be steric
limitations in the Abs’ access to the targets. The RyR and/or
pSer2808 positions may be subject to offsets due to the size of the
Ab markers relative to the effective resolution of the data, hence
we required a distance-based likelihood criterion for determining
the identity of the RyRs carrying the detected phosphorylation. Probes
that are more compact but compatible with the pro-ExM chemistry should
be examined in the future as a solution to this.

We have used
flat, near-surface nanodomains in our simulations to exploit the certainty
of the 2D geometry of cytoplasmic Ca2+ diffusion. One of
the main limitations in the 10× EExM images of RyR and pSer2808
is the lack of an independent marker of the curvature of the t-tubular
membranes62 which determines the 3D diffusion
of Ca2+ both within and beyond the nanodomain. This is
a limitation particularly in MCT-RV cells where the t-tubular system
broadly undergoes remodelling,77 and there
is visual evidence in the 10× EExM data of diminishing curvature
of the nanodomain. Future investigations therefore would benefit from
establishing reliable plasmalemmal and SR markers compatible with
ExM. Furthermore, the simulations utilized a general description of
RyR dynamics and phenomenological implementation of phosphorylation.
Future detailed modeling studies would benefit from biophysically
detailed species- and disease-specific formulations of these model
components; results presented occurred within parameter ranges which
illustrated the differences between control and MCT, but do not necessarily
translate to those which may manifest physiological behavior. These
simulation results should therefore be considered as a demonstration
of the potential for the structural data attained to be used in future
mechanistic studies rather than rigorous analysis of the effect of
MCT remodelling on cardiac CICR. Nevertheless, these data indicate
an important role for nanodomain structure in regulating EC coupling,
illustrating that the number of RyRs, their spatial distribution,
and both the proportion and distribution of phosphorylation sites
can all have an impact on local Ca2+ dynamics and inducibility
of CICR; all these factors are observed to be remodelled in MCT and
potentially other disease models.

Conclusions
The
enhancement to the ExM approach has allowed us to map nanoscale
features located deeper within cells at a resolution of ∼15
nm. Exploiting this capability, we have resolved individual RyRs forming
3D complex clusters within nanodomains in the cell interior. Detection
of nanometer-scale changes in position and likelihood of site-specific
phosphorylation has allowed us to simulate geometrically realistic
spatiotemporal profiles of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals which
are encoded by these nanodomains.

Methods
Cell Preparation
and Animal Models
Live myocytes were
isolated from hearts freshly dissected from Wistar rats, euthanized
according to a protocol approved by the UK Home Office. Pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH) was induced in 5-week old adult rats with
a single intraperitoneal injection of monocrotaline (MCT; Sigma-Aldrich),
as detailed previously.78 RV-failure was
typically observed between days 21 and 28, when the animals were euthanized
(references to these cell samples are notated as “MCT-RV”
in the text). Isolated right ventricular cells were adhered to coverslips
as described before20 and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde
(Sigma) for immunocytochemistry. For examining the effects of stimulating
RyR phosphorylation, living cells were simultaneously stimulated with
electrical field stimuli at 1 Hz and 100 nM Isoproterenol (Sigma)
dissolved in Tyrode’s solution prior to fixation. See Supporting Information experimental procedures
for more a detailed protocol. Data presented in this manuscript included
cells isolated from four control animals and five MCT-treated animals.
Sample numbers stated in the text refer to cell numbers considered
in each analysis.

EExM
ExM was performed on fixed
and stained cell samples
either according to the proExM protocol for 4× expansion34 or X10 microscopy protocol.42 Immunofluorescent labeling protocol is detailed in the Supporting Information. pSer2808 was labeled
with anti-RyR2-pSer2808 IgG (A010-30AP, Badrilla Ltd., UK). Among
the secondary Abs that we tested, we chose goat antimouse and goat
antirabbit conjugates of AlexaFluor488 and JaneliaFluor549 for their
strongest photostability during the ExM protocol and shorter wavelength
of emission, conducive for superior imaging resolution. The labeling
patterns seen with these Abs were also visually confirmed by ExM samples
labeled with longer-wavelength secondary Ab (conjugates of Atto 647-N).
Samples were subjected to confocal or Airyscan imaging on an inverted
LSM880 with Airyscan (Carl Zeiss, Jena) used with a Plan-Apochromat
63× 1.4 NA objective with a working distance of 0.19 mm. Image
sampling was set to <40 nm/px in x–y plane and 100 nm in z. The true spatial
scale of the images was calculated by multiplying the voxel sampling
by the linear expansion factor of the given gel (estimated as detailed
in Supplementary Figure S3E). All distances
reported in the Results and Discussion sections from ExM data are
based on these rescaled distances.

DNA-PAINT and dSTORM of immuno-labeled
cells were performed as detailed in previous reports,20,24 on a custom-built Nikon TE2000 TIRF microscope equipped with a 60×
1.49 NA TIRF objective and a 671 nm diode laser (Viasho, China). For
dSTORM, the beam angle was inclined to achieve HiLo illumination,55 focused deeper into the sample. Primary DNA-PAINT
and dSTORM data were recorded with an Andor Zyla-5.5 sCMOS camera
(Andor, Belfast) using the freely available Python Microscopy Environment
(PyME) software (www.python-microscopy.org). PYME was used for localizing the fluorophore positions and rendering
the point data of dSTORM and DNA-PAINT experiments onto 5 and 1 nm
pixel grids for further spatial analyses.

See Supporting Information experimental
procedures for more details on imaging protocols.

Spatial Analysis
of EExM and DNA-PAINT Data
Segmentation
Local ensembles of
punctate RyR densities
were segmented into cluster regions on a binary mask using a protocol
used previously for segmenting DNA-PAINT images.20,24 These masks were used for the distance-based analysis (Figure 4J) of labeling density
using a Euclidean distance transform of the cluster area as detailed
before.79

Detection
Punctate
labeling densities which were typical
for RyR and pSer2808 Ab labeling in EExM and DNA-PAINT data were analyzed
by their spatial distribution. A detection algorithm, similar to that
used previously,20 was implemented in Python
to record the 3D coordinates of the centroid of each punctum; each
punctum was approximated as a single RyR, as before.20 For cell surface (2D) DNA-PAINT and 10× EExM data,
the detection was 2D. A 3D implementation of this was used for mapping
RyR and pSer2808 puncta in the cell interiors. Please see Supporting Information experimental procedures
for a detailed protocol. To measure the longitudinal separation between
the double peaks of α-actinin, the subpixel centroids of each
intensity peak were calculated using a Gaussian line profile fitting
procedure detailed previously.61,80 The average distance
between the two centroids was calculated for each line (as plotted
in Figure 1D).

Estimation
of the Point Spread Function and Effective Resolution
The
PSF for the confocal deconvolution was estimated by acquiring
and averaging between 3D confocal z-stacks of 100 nm yellow-green
or red-orange Fluospheres (ThermoFisher) immobilized inside a 2% agarose
gel at a depth of ∼20 μm from the coverslip. To estimate
the effective PSF of Airyscan postprocessing 3D image data, 20 nm
yellow-green Fluosphere beads were imaged within a 2% agarose gel
and subjected to the same analysis. The effective PSF in EExM experiments
was estimated by scaling the Airyscan PSF by the expansion factor
of the specific sample. Line intensity profiles both in-plane and
axial dimensions of the EExM PSF volumes (e.g., Supplementary Figure S4B)
were fitted with a 1D Gaussian function, and the full-width at half-maximum
(fwhm) was taken as a close approximation of the resolution. Variations
in this fwhm were observed by taking line profiles from beads embedded
within the agarose gel at depths of 5, 30, and 47 μm (overlaid
in Supplementary Figure S4B). These reported
in-plane fwhm’s of 13.3, 14.8, and 17.3 nm and axial fwhm’s
of 33.4, 39, and 46 nm at these depths, respectively.

The estimated
PSF is subject to two principal uncertainties. These include the error
in localizing the centroids of the bead images prior to averaging
(with bead alignment based on a least-squares approach, we estimate
that this associates a broadening of the estimated PSF < 1.5%).
Further, potential shift variances in the PSF when sampling beads
in different locations of the sample would have led to a broader PSF.
In the bead data acquired, we did not observe major differences in
the bead images from different regions (laterally) within the imaging
field which could not be explained by noise or subpixel-scale drift
of the beads.

The chromatic alignment of the AlexaFluor488 (green)
and JaneliaFluor549
(red) emission channels was important for accurately localizing the
pSer2808 signatures of RyRs. We assessed this alignment by acquiring
the Airyscan images of Hydro-gel embedded 100 nm TetraSpeck microspheres
(Thermo) in the emission channels under the sample imaging parameters
(see Supplementary Figure S12). Based on
this analysis, the spatial error between the channels was estimated
to be ∼10%, subject to the errors in localizing the beads which
apply to PSF estimation.

Simulation of Confocal, dSTORM, DNA-PAINT,
and EExM Images
3D models of the z-disc (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3) and the curved nanodomains (supplementary Figure S5) were convolved with a PSF that approximated
the resolution achieved by each technique. Confocal and Airyscan PSFs
were estimated by imaging 100 nm microspheres in the same imaging
conditions as the samples. For 4× and 10× EExM, the Airyscan
PSF was upscaled as detailed above. dSTORM and DNA-PAINT simulations
used the image simulator of PyME detailed previously.20

pSer2808 Reassignment
The 3D coordinates
of the RyR
and pSer2808 labeling puncta were detected independently (in their
separate channels of the two-color data). The RyR puncta which contained
a pSer2808 punctum was marked as phosphorylated. Only one RyR was
assigned to one pSer2808 punctum.

See Supporting Information experimental procedures for more details on analysis
protocols.

Simulation of the Spatiotemporal Ca2+ Dynamics
To simulate Ca2+ dynamics, selected
nanodomains were
discretized at a resolution of 10 nm and embedded in a 2D grid. Ca2+ dynamics within this grid are described by the regular 2D
reaction-diffusion equation. L-type Ca2+ channel flux was
represented by an idealized triangular waveform, and RyR dynamics,
controlling intracellular calcium release, were described through
a simple 2-state stochastic model. The original in vitro study examining the effects of RyR gating kinetics following nonspecific
phosphorylation of RyRs by Protein Kinase A reported an increase in
the RyR open probability by up to a factor of 3.5.54 To capture an approximate effect of Ser2808-specific phosphorylation
in our simulation, the phosphorylated state of the RyR channel was
modeled as an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the RyRs
(by a factor 1.5–3); phosphorylation sites were given either
by the imaging data or assigned randomly according the spatial distributions.
Simulations were performed over a range of parameters, 10 simulations
per condition, with the behavior of the different geometries and with/without
phosphorylation compared under consistent parameter conditions. Equations
and parameters are presented in the Supporting Information.
