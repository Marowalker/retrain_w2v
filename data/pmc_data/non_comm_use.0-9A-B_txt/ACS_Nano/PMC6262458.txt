The
processes that govern radiative recombination in ternary CuInS2 (CIS) nanocrystals (NCs) have been heavily debated, but recently,
several research groups have come to the same conclusion that a photoexcited
electron recombines with a localized hole on a Cu-related trap state.
Furthermore, it has been observed that single CIS NCs display narrower
photoluminescence (PL) line widths than the ensemble, which led to
the conclusion that within the ensemble there is a distribution of
Cu-related trap states responsible for PL. In this work, we probe
this trap-state distribution with in situ photoluminescence
spectroelectrochemistry. We find that Cu2+ states result
in individual “dark” nanocrystals, whereas Cu+ states result in “bright” NCs. Furthermore, we show
that we can tune the PL position, intensity, and line width in a cyclic
fashion by injecting or removing electrons from the trap-state distribution,
thereby converting a subset of “dark” Cu2+ containing NCs into “bright” Cu+ containing
NCs and vice versa. The electrochemical injection
of electrons results in brightening, broadening, and a red shift of
the PL, in line with the activation of a broad distribution of “dark”
NCs (Cu2+ states) into “bright” NCs (Cu+ states) and a rise of the Fermi level within the ensemble
trap-state distribution. The opposite trend is observed for electrochemical
oxidation of Cu+ states into Cu2+. Our work
shows that there is a direct correlation between the line width of
the ensemble Cu+/Cu2+ trap-state distribution
and the characteristic broad-band PL feature of CIS NCs and between
Cu2+ cations in the photoexcited state (bright) and in
the electrochemically oxidized ground state (dark).

Interest
in ternary CuInS2 (CIS) nanocrystals (NCs) as less-toxic
alternatives for cadmium-containing
NCs has increased considerably over the past few years.1−5 Based on the synthetic methodology, i.e., direct
synthesis6,7 or cation exchange in template Cu2-xS nanocrystals,8,9 quasi-spherical NCs with the chalcopyrite
crystal structure, or anisotropic morphologies with the wurtzite crystal
structure,10,11 can be easily obtained. Regardless
of the crystal structure or the morphology, ternary CIS nanocrystals
are characterized by a large global Stokes shift, long carrier lifetimes
and a broad photoluminescence (PL) band.3,12−14 Several mechanisms for the radiative recombination in ternary CIS
NCs have been proposed over the years, but recently, a number of research
groups have come to the same conclusion that radiative recombination
is dominated by a hole on a localized in-gap state and a delocalized
conduction band (CB) electron.12−15 Furthermore, single NC spectroscopy experiments by
the Klimov group14 and the Gamelin group12 indicate that the PL line width of individual
CIS NCs is narrower than the ensemble PL (Figure 1a), although their interpretation of the
reason behind the narrower single NC PL differs. The Klimov group
proposed that individual CIS NCs contain luminescent Cu-related defects
within the band gap with a slightly different position with respect
to the band edges, giving rise to narrow single NC PL but broad ensemble
PL. In contrast, the Gamelin group states that the single NC PL is
narrower than the ensemble but still significantly broadened compared
to typical excitonic PL as a result of the formation of a self-trapped
exciton and corresponding strong electron–phonon coupling.12,14 Recently, de Mello-Donegá and co-workers have shown with
transient absorption spectroscopy that the process of light emission
proceeds via quick localization of the photogenerated
hole on the luminescent defect,13 as was
also suggested by others.16 These examples
show that the peculiar photophysics of CIS NCs are still heavily debated
despite the consensus about the existence of midgap states that quickly
localize the photogenerated holes and result in radiative recombination
with the delocalized conduction band electron.

Figure 1 Schematics showing the
models for radiative recombination in ternary
CuInS2 nanocrystals, where (a) individual nanocrystals
have narrower PL line widths than the ensemble, which is characterized
by a broad PL line width. (b) This broad PL line width is hypothesized
to correspond to a distribution of Cu-related trap states. The hole
and electron traps within the band gap compete with the radiative
recombination on the Cu-related defect states and, hence, result in
the quenching of the PL. (c) Our model for radiative recombination
in ternary CIS NCs involves radiative Cu+ defects (below
the Fermi level, EF) and non-radiative
Cu2+ defect states (above EF). Nanocrystals that contain a single Cu2+ state are “dark”.
Surface electron traps within the band gap have a detrimental effect
on the PLQY of ternary NCs as well. The distribution of single “bright”
Cu+ (below EF) and “dark”
Cu2+ (above EF) centers within
the ensemble can be tuned by an electrochemical potential.

Figure 1 schematically
shows a combination of the current models for radiative recombination
in ternary CIS NCs in which each individual CIS NC displays a narrower
PL band than the ensemble at a slightly different wavelength. This
is either due to a transition involving a Cu-related defect with a
different position with respect to the band edges or due to a self-trapped
exciton in combination with varying degrees of electron–phonon
coupling, as discussed above (Figure 1a,b).16−18 This results in a trap-state distribution for the
ensemble PL, whereas individual NCs have narrower PL line widths with
slightly different PL wavelengths (Figure 1a,b).12,14 After photoexcitation,
the photexcited electron radiatively recombines with a rapidly trapped
hole, which is localized on the Cu-related state within the trap-state
distribution (Figure 1b). However, the exact nature, and especially the oxidation state,
of this Cu-related state is heavily debated. It has been proposed
that both Cu2+ and Cu+ trap states are present
in CIS NCs and result in photoluminescence, albeit via different recombination pathways.12,14−19 We will first assume that indeed both Cu+ and Cu2+ are present (Figure 1b) and intend to validate this hypothesis by in situ spectroelectrochemistry.

Recently, two research groups presented
changes of the PL in ternary
CIS NCs as a function of an applied electrochemical potential.17,20 They both observed brightening and darkening of the PL band, which
was attributed to a competition between the radiative transition of
the delocalized electron in the CB to the localized hole on the Cu
defect, with hole and electron trapping in band-gap states near the
CB and valence band (VB) edges (Figure 1b).17,20 These band-gap states are inferred
to originate from surface defects21 because
the overgrowth of a wide band-gap shell results in reduced dependence
of the PL intensity on the applied potential and an increase in the
steady-state PL intensity.17,20 While surface defects
have a detrimental influence on the PLQY of ternary nanomaterials,
they are not the only source of non-radiative recombination that needs
to be considered because unity PLQY values are not reached upon epitaxial
shell overgrowth.6,7 Klimov and co-workers also discussed
the differences between radiative recombination on Cu+ centers,
which they conclude is dominant in stoichiometric CIS NCs and is largely
influenced by both electron and hole trapping, and on Cu2+ centers, which they believe to dominate in Cu deficient samples.20 A complication in their discussion is that it
requires the assumption that Cu2+ and Cu+ ions
are not in electrochemical equilibrium and their ratio is not affected
by changing the Fermi level electrochemically. Although hole/electron
trapping at surface defects clearly affects the PL intensity, which
can be tuned by raising the Fermi level,17,20 the oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ can also explain
the spectroelectrochemical brightening and darkening trends, as we
will discuss below.

Here, we probe the nature of the trap-state
distribution with in situ photoluminescence spectroelectrochemistry
and in situ X-ray absorption measurements and correlate
it to
the characteristic optical features of ternary nanomaterials (i.e., broad-band and low-intensity PL). Specifically, we
observe a shift and PL line width broadening and narrowing upon raising
and lowering the Fermi level, which cannot be explained by reduced
electron and hole trapping only. We find that we can activate the
individual luminescent centers by injecting electrons into the trap-state
distribution (i.e., reducing some of the NCs), thereby
converting single NCs containing “dark” Cu2+ centers into “bright” Cu+ centers, which
effectively switches some NCs within the ensemble in the “on”
state. Vice versa, oxidizing some of the NCs results
in deactivation of the bright Cu+ centers, which switches
some NCs into the “off” state. Activation of the luminescent
Cu+ centers results in photobrightening of the ensemble
PL (by ∼15%) but also in a shift to lower energies and a broadening
of the PL band. Deactivation results in the opposite: quenching of
the PL (by ∼55%), a shift to higher energies of the PL maximum,
and narrowing of the ensemble PL. Interestingly, the shift and changes
in the PL line width have not been observed before and are in perfect
agreement with a shift of the Fermi level (EF) within an
ensemble distribution of individual “bright” Cu+ (below EF) and “dark”
Cu2+ (above EF) centers (Figure 1c). These results
show that the broad PL line width in ternary CIS NCs indeed correlates
with the ensemble distribution of trap states within
the band gap. In the excited state, photogenerated holes oxidize Cu+ centers to Cu2+, followed by efficient luminescence.
However, the electrochemical oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ results in “dark” NCs. This apparent discrepancy
is explained by the presence of the photogenerated hole in the valence
band (VB) in the case of electrochemically oxidized Cu2+ centers. This photogenerated hole provides a pathway for fast nonradiative
Auger trapping on the Cu2+ defect, effectively quenching
the luminescence. Our results indicate that there is a direct correlation
between the presence of Cu2+ and the characteristic optical
properties of ternary CIS NCs, like relatively low PL quantum yield,
large global Stokes shift, and broad-band photoluminescence, which
can be tuned by electrochemical injection and extraction of electrons.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of CuInS2 Nanocrystals
The CuInS2 (CIS) nanocrystals
were characterized with
optical spectroscopy (Figure S1), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, Figure S2) and
X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Figure S3).
These measurements indicate that CIS NCs of 2.9, 3.4, 3.7, and 5.5
nm with the chalcopyrite crystal structure were successfully synthesized.
Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements revealed a PLQY
value of 0.7% for 3.4 nm CIS NCs, both in a colloidal dispersion and
in a NC film (Figure S4). Low PLQY values
around 1% are typical for ternary nanocrystals.1−4 The size of the NCs was established
from the PL peak position because the low TEM contrast does not allow
for a reliable size determination (Figure S2), and a detailed size versus PL maximum relation
for CIS NCs was presented by Li et al.(6) These CIS NCs were used in the spectroelectrochemistry
measurements discussed in the rest of this work.

In
Situ Spectroelectrochemistry
Spectroelectrochemistry
is a powerful tool to study charge injection into semiconductor nanomaterials
because it allows the probing of the optical properties while electrons
are injected into and extracted from the NC film.22−24 Spectroelectrochemical
absorption measurements give valuable information on the position
of the band edges with respect to vacuum25 and allow the determination of the number of electrons injected
and extracted in and from the band edges, respectively.26,27 Therefore, we performed in situ absorption spectroscopy
during electrochemical charging of CIS NC films in a wide potential
window, ranging from −2.5 to +2.0 V versus Ag PRE (Figure 2).
A clear reduction feature is observed around −1.8 V as well
as an oxidation peak around +0.6 V. Typically, these features are
assigned to the band edges of the CIS NC2,28−31 because the measured electrochemical band gap (2.4 V) is of the
same order as the optical band gap (550 nm, 2.3 eV). However, the
combination of cyclic voltammetry with in situ absorption
measurements used here (Figure 2b) reveals no changes in absorption at these reduction and
oxidation peaks, suggesting that these features cannot be assigned
to the CB and VB edges because state filling of the band edges would
result in a decrease in absorption.32,33 Furthermore,
the NCs deteriorate irreversibly at positive potentials, indicated
by an overall, irreversible decrease in absorption (Figure 2b). In contrast, we find that
for a smaller potential window (between −0.4 and +0.4 V) the
CVs are fully reversible, and no deterioration of the NCs occurs (inset
of Figure 2a). Therefore,
we focus on this smaller potential window for the remainder of this
paper.

Figure 2 Cyclic voltammetry and differential absorbance. (a) Cyclic voltammogram
between −2.5 to +2.0 V for 2.9 nm CIS NCs, showing irreversible
reduction and oxidation features. Reversible features were only observed
in a narrow potential window of ∼−0.4 to ∼+0.4
V vs Ag PRE (inset). (b) Differential absorbance
plots as a function of applied potential. No changes in absorbance
are observed at negative applied potentials despite a small induced
absorbance at −2.5 V, originating from charging of the ITO
substrate. At positive potentials exceeding +0.5 V, irreversible absorption
changes are observed due to deterioration of the NC film. For comparison,
the steady-state absorption is plotted on top of the differential
absorbance plot (black line, right axis).

In addition to in situ absorption spectroscopy,
we also performed in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy34,35 during the electrochemical charging of 5.5 nm CuInS2 nanocrystals
(Figure 3). The same
measurements were performed on the three other sizes of CIS NCs (Figures S5–7). The cyclic voltammogram
(CV, Figure 3a) shows
a positive current at an applied potential of ∼0.3 V versus Ag PRE, indicative of electron extraction from the
working electrode. Again, the differential absorption spectra are
devoid of any features in this potential window (Figure S8), indicating that no electrons are injected into
and extracted from the band edges at these applied potentials.25,36 Possibly, in the potential window studied here (Figure 3a, −0.5 to +0.5 V versus Ag PRE) electrons are only injected and extracted
into and from in-gap trap states, respectively,22 or other side reactions, like the oxidation and reduction
of surface ligands, might occur.

Temporal evolution plots of (c) the PL intensity, (d) the PL maximum,
and (e) PL bandwidth. (f) The derivative of the PL change as a function
of the applied potential (dPL/dV, blue line) shows
that there is an offset between the maximum current density (+0.4
V vs Ag PRE, black line) and the maximum change in
PL (+0.3 V vs Ag PRE). The variation in PL intensity
as a function of applied potential is plotted for comparison (red
line).

Because the radiative recombination
in ternary CIS NCs involves
midgap trap states (Figure 1), in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy
will give valuable insights into the influence of additional charges
on the radiative recombination in this material. We find that at the
maximum negative applied potential (−0.5 V), the PL band is
slightly shifted to longer wavelengths (i.e., lower
energies) and has increased in intensity (Figure 3b, red line at −0.02 V, open circuit
potential, Voc, and brown line at −0.5
V versus Ag PRE). The opposite is observed for the
maximum positive applied potential: the PL peak maximum has shifted
considerably to shorter wavelengths (i.e., higher
energy) and has decreased in intensity (Figure 3b, red line at Voc and blue line at +0.5 V versus Ag PRE).

We
follow the evolution of the three main characteristics of the
PL band as a function of the applied potential: the intensity (Figure 3c), position of the
maximum (Figure 3d),
and the PL bandwidth (Figure 3e). These plots show a clear correlation between the characteristic
PL features and the applied potential. At negative applied potentials
(electron injection), the PL maximum red shifts slightly by ∼6
nm (Figure 3d), whereas
the intensity increases by ∼15% (Figure 3c). Furthermore, the PL band broadens by
∼10% (Figure 3e). This implies that the absolute PLQY increases from 0.7% to 0.8%.
At positive applied potentials (electron extraction), the optical
changes are more pronounced: the PL maximum blue shifts by ∼25
nm, the intensity drops by over 50% and the PL band narrows by ∼15%,
resulting in a PLQY decrease from 0.7% at Voc to 0.4% at +0.5 V versus Ag PRE. We observe the
same trends for the other sizes of CIS NCs (Figure S5–7). The small, steady decline of the PL intensity
after a full CV cycle (Figure 3c) is attributed to laser damage due to the focused laser
spot (Figure S9).

It is tempting
to associate the observed changes in the PL characteristics
to the oxidation and reduction waves seen in the CV (Figure 3a). However, we find that the
maximum change in PL intensity (analyzed by taking the derivative
of the PL intensity as a function of the applied potential, dPL/dV; Figure 3f) does not correspond to the highest current density for all CIS
NCs studied here. As shown in Figure S10, for all investigated sizes, the maximum change in PL occurs at
significantly more negative potentials than the maximum current
observed in the CVs. Therefore, we infer that the observed oxidation
and reduction waves in the CVs actually originate from other species
in the system than the radiative recombination centers, such as bound
surface thiolate ligands.37−39 In fact, the potential of the
observed oxidation wave with respect to vacuum (+0.45 V versus Ag PRE corresponds to −5.2 V versus vacuum)
is close to the potential of the oxidation of surface thiolate ligands
on colloidal CdTe NCs (−5.15 V versus vacuum).39 Furthermore, it is likely that the ratio between
surface thiolate ligands and internal Cu+/Cu2+ states is large, which makes the current corresponding to the oxidation
of bound thiolates dominant in the CV scans.

Interestingly,
we find a good agreement between the line width
of the PL (between 220 and 250 meV) and the width of the variation
in PL intensity as a function of applied potential (∼250 meV;
see Figure S10). This suggests that the
observed PL line width is indeed due to a relatively broad distribution
of Cu+/Cu2+ states, as was inferred above (Figure 1c). Our results thus
show that the combination of cyclic voltammetry with optical measurements
is crucial to assign the observed electrochemical features to specific
characteristics of the NCs under study.

Mechanism and Model for
Radiative Recombination in Ternary CuInS2 Nanocrystals
In a detailed spectroscopic study by
Berends et al., it was suggested that in “bright”
NCs holes trap very rapidly (less than a picosecond) and recombine
radiatively with conduction band electrons, while in “dark”
NCs, both charge carriers are trapped and recombine non-radiatively.13 Recently, Brovelli and co-workers reported on
reduced electron trapping by raising the Fermi level, which resulted
in brighter CIS NCs.17 Indeed, the filling
of trap states, which reduces the electron trapping probability, is
a possible explanation for the increase in PL efficiency upon raising
the Fermi level, as was observed previously by our group in films
of CdTe NCs.22,40 However, filling of electron
traps is incompatible with the other trends observed in our current
experiments, i.e., the red shift of the PL and the
broadening of the PL band upon electron injection. Because the radiative
recombination in ternary CIS NCs is established to be from the conduction
band edge toward a localized hole state within the band gap, reduced
electron trapping due to a rise of the Fermi level will only affect
the PL intensity and not the PL energy and bandwidth, as observed
here. Our results therefore show that the trap level that is filled
and emptied electrochemically is directly involved in the radiative
recombination process.

Our in situ PL spectroelectrochemistry
experiments can be very well explained by oxidation of Cu+ into Cu2+, which results in “dark” NCs,
as was suggested in Figure 1c. To verify that electrochemical oxidation of CIS NCs indeed
results in an increase in Cu2+ cations, we measured the
Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra
upon application of a reducing and oxidizing potential by in situ X-ray absorption measurements41−44 and analyzed the observed features
in the XANES pattern by simulating the spectra with standard FEFF
and FDMES programs (Figures 4 and S11–13). From this, we attempt to correlate
the observed quenching/brightening of the characteristic PL feature
of CIS NCs under oxidizing and reducing conditions to the presence
of Cu2+ cations (“dark”) and Cu+ cations (“bright”). Our simulations show that the
so-called “white line”, which is the main peak observed
in the Cu K-edge XANES spectrum, decreases when a small cluster is
simulated compared to the bulk CIS spectrum (Figure 4a), in line with a decrease of the ratio
between internal and surface Cu atoms.44 Interestingly, when additional positive charge is added to the simulated
cluster, the “white line” increases more drastically
(Figure 4a). In general,
a more-intense “white line” is associated with an increase
of positive charge on the absorber atom45,46 and thus infers
an increase in the average oxidation state of the absorber atoms.
When an electrochemical potential is applied, no evident variations
in the pre-edge region, typically assigned to Cu2+, are
observed (Figure 4b).
Small, but more evident, changes can be observed at the main
peak (Figure 4b). This
suggests that either the ratio between internal and surface Cu atoms
increases44 or that the average oxidation
state of the Cu atoms >1 upon the application of an electrochemical
potential (Figure 4b),45,46 effectively increasing the net positive
charge at oxidizing potentials and decreasing the net positive charge
at reducing potentials. In fact, given the low number of luminescent
Cu sites that change oxidation state, as suggested by the in situ electrochemistry results discussed above, it will
be very challenging to gain conclusive information on these Cu2+ sites from Cu K-edge XANES measurements to distinguish between
these two possibilities. To improve this analysis, the same measurements
could be performed in fluorescence mode at the Cu L3-edge
because this edge is more sensitive to d-type electrons that are likely
involved here (electron configuration Cu2+: [Ar]3d9).

Figure 4 Simulated and experimental Cu K-edge XANES spectra. (a) Simulated
XANES spectra for bulk CuInS2 (CIS, red line), a small
CIS cluster without additional charge (orange line), a small cluster
with net positive charge of +1.02 (light blue line), and +1.1 (dark
blue line), compared to the experimental CIS NC XANES spectrum (black
line). An increase in the “white line”, which is the
main peak at the edge, is observed when more internal Cu atoms are
present with respect to surface Cu atoms and when the net positive
charge increases. (b) In situ XANES spectra at open
circuit potential (Voc, red line), at
−0.5 V vs Ag PRE (brown line), and at +0.5
V vs Ag PRE (light blue line), showing a small increase
in the intensity of the “white line” upon the application
of an oxidizing potential. The inset shows a zoomed-in view of the
white line.

While the in
situ XANES measurements on their
own are not conclusive evidence of the presence of Cu2+ and the variation of the Cu+-to-Cu2+ ratio
with changing electrochemical potential, the results are in line with
the spectroelectrochemical findings presented above. Based on these
combined results, we propose that we can activate “dark”
NCs into “bright” NCs by injecting electrons into the
CIS NCs, thereby increasing the PL intensity because more Cu+ states are involved in the radiative recombination process. As shown
in Figure 5, we propose
that this occurs via the reduction of a “dark”
Cu2+ defect containing CIS NC to a “bright”
Cu+ containing NC by injection of an electron, which affects
not only the PL intensity but also the PL bandwidth and maximum of
the ensemble due to the rise of the Fermi level within the ensemble
distribution of trap states (Figure 5b). The “activated” Cu+ can
subsequently trap a photogenerated hole and, hence, contribute to
radiative recombination (Figure 5c).13 As a consequence,
the distribution of active trap states in the ensemble is broadened
upon raising the Fermi level, resulting in broader PL line widths
(Figure 5c). Furthermore,
this shifts the PL peak position to the red side of the PL band because
the separation between the conduction band edge and the maximum of
the distribution of activated defect states (Fermi level, EF) has decreased. The opposite is observed for
oxidizing potentials (Figure 5d).

Figure 5 Recombination mechanism upon reducing and oxidizing potentials.
(a) Schematic representation of radiative recombination in an ensemble
of ternary CuInS2 nanocrystals, which involves a distribution
of trap states, corresponding to single Cu+ (below the
Fermi level, EF) and Cu2+ (above EF) defect states for each individual NC. Active
defect states (Cu+) within the band gap are indicated by
the colored area in the trap-state distribution. (b) The distribution
of trap states determines the width, position, and intensity of the
PL band, depending on the ratio between NCs containing Cu2+ (positive potentials) and Cu+ (negative potentials) trap
states within the ensemble. The distribution of trap states can be
tuned by (c) applying positive potentials vs Ag pseudoreference
electrode (PRE) and (d) negative potentials vs Ag
PRE. This results in (c) a shift to lower energy, broadening of the
PL line width and an increase in intensity when negative potentials
are applied, and (d) a shift to higher energy, narrowing of the PL
line width and a decrease in intensity when positive potentials are
applied by (c) activating single Cu+ trap states and (d)
deactivating single Cu+ trap states, which is responsible
for radiative recombination in ternary CuInS2 nanocrystals.
(e) Efficient Auger recombination of the electron with the excess
hole (in a single electrochemically oxidized Cu2+ cation
within a CIS NCs), and the photogenerated hole in the VB edge results
in additional non-radiative recombination and, hence, quenching of
the PL. (f) In the absence of a Cu2+ center, the single
CIS NC is bright after quick localization of the photogenerated hole
on the Cu+ center and radiative recombination with the
delocalized CB electron.

Our observations are in contrast to the observations of Klimov
and co-workers, who recently reported on the presence of both active
Cu2+ and Cu+ luminescent centers in the ground
state, depending on the Cu-to-In ratio in the CIS NCs.19,20 They state that Cu2+ defects also display photoluminescence
but that a separate hole-trapping state is necessary for the Cu2+ state to be active.20 Furthermore,
they suggest that if the photogenerated hole is not trapped, band-edge
recombination will out-compete the radiative recombination transition
to the Cu2+ cation.20 We note
that band edge recombination is not observed in our experiments. In
fact, when an oxidizing potential is applied, the suggested hole traps
that render Cu2+ centers emissive20 will be depleted of electrons and, hence, can no longer trap photogenerated
holes. One could expect that this results in enhancement of the band
edge recombination,20 which is not what
we observe when oxidizing potentials are applied. We suggest that
in the case of empty hole trap states, an Auger-assisted trapping
process of the conduction band electron to the in-gap Cu2+ center, which excites the valence band hole to a deeper energy level,
will open up. This then results in nonradiative recombination and
the absence of both band-edge and trap-state emission. However, as
we discuss in more detail below, we believe that this non-radiative
trap-assisted Auger recombination pathway is also present in the ground
state. In this scenario, the Cu+/Cu2+ emissive
state is the only state required to explain the PL dependence on the
applied potential.

We suggest that the presence of Cu2+ cations renders
the NC “dark”, due to efficient trap-assisted Auger
recombination. As shown in Figure 5e, this process involves a conduction band electron
that is trapped nonradiatively on the Cu2+ defect, while
the energy is transferred to the photogenerated valence band hole.
We note that this is similar to our earlier observation that electrons
trap rapidly to deep defect states near the VB edge in CdTe NCs via Auger excitation of photogenerated holes22 and also similar to trap-assisted Auger recombination
of excess CB electrons in Cu+-doped CdSe/CdS NCs.47

If each NC contains a large number of
luminescent Cu+ trap states, then oxidizing a fraction
of those trap states would
leave many active Cu+ states in the band gap on which the
photogenerated hole can localize and avoid Auger recombination, given
that hole localization is much faster than Auger recombination. This
would suggest that the NCs remain luminescent. However, we have no
indication of the rate of Auger recombination. For our model to be
consistent, we thus need to assume that each NC contains only a few
photoactive Cu-based traps. This is supported by the observation that
the observed electrochemical peaks do not result in the variations
in the PL characteristics, which suggests that small concentrations
of Cu+/Cu2+ states are oxidized and reduced
(Figure 3f). For CdTe
NCs, we have observed a similar trap-assisted Auger recombination
process as inferred here, which takes place within a picosecond,22 on a similar time scale as has been reported
for hole trapping in CIS NCs.13 Thus, there
could be an effective competition between hole trapping and Auger
recombination that changes depending on the relative number of available
Cu+ levels for hole trapping, which is responsible for
the change of the PLQY with electrochemical potential. Once all luminescent
Cu traps in a NC are oxidized to Cu2+, the NC turns dark
completely. This suggests that we are switching some NCs into the
“off” state by oxidizing the “active”
Cu+ states into “inactive” Cu2+ states. We specifically note that it thus takes only one, or at
most a few, electrochemically oxidized Cu2+ cations to
turn the NC dark.

These results indicate that the distribution
of active hole-trap
states (Cu+ defects) within the ensemble correlates directly
to the bandwidth of the PL, and that this distribution can be reversibly
tuned by electrochemical methods. The hypothesis from these in situ photoluminescence spectroelectrochemistry measurements
is therefore that dark states correspond to Cu2+ defects
and bright states to Cu+ defects. However, direct evidence
that Cu defects are involved in the photoluminescence and that it
is their oxidation state that changes in the electrochemical scans
is still lacking. Previously, it has only been inferred from the position
of the oxidation and reduction waves observed in the CVs2,20 because the potentials are close to what has been measured in water
for the Cu+/Cu2+ couple.48 We note that the Cu+/Cu2+ reduction
and oxidation in CIS NCs is likely different from that of dissolved
ions in water.48 Furthermore, as was discussed
above, there is an offset between the maximum current density and
the maximum change in PL of ∼0.1 eV (Figure S10), which leads to the conclusion that the observed oxidation/reduction
waves do not correspond to the luminescent Cu+/Cu2+ redox couple but possibly to surface thiolate ligands.37−39 In addition, we wish to note that the concentration of Cu2+ cations in the ensemble is likely very low. If 1 out of 100 Cu cations
in a CIS NC is a Cu2+, and not all CIS NCs contain a Cu2+, the ensemble Cu2+ concentration will be much
lower than 1%. Therefore, elemental analysis techniques, such as in situ XANES (as attempted here), will possibly have insufficient
sensitivity for Cu2+ to deconvolute the Cu2+ and Cu+ signals. However, by combining in situ electrochemistry with photoluminescence measurements we are able
to probe even small variations in the oxidation state because the
redox couple is directly involved in the radiative recombination process.

One open question is exactly where these Cu2+/Cu+ defect states are located. The electrochemical potential
of these Cu2+/Cu+ defect states is likely different
from the other lattice Cu+ cations within a CIS NC. Due
to the highly localized nature of these states, their energy is easily
perturbed by the presence of surface defects or lattice charges, as
predicted in a recent density functional theory (DFT) study,49 leading to a variable energy of the localized
state within the band gap, which causes the ensemble broadening. The
fact that heteroepitaxial shell overgrowth with a wider band gap semiconductor
results in an increase in PLQY and similar broad-band PL features
as bare CIS NCs indicates that these defect states are not located
at the surface of the NCs, meaning they should be internal defects.6,7,50 As suggested by the same DFT
study, the emissive Cu+ centers could be located at CuIn anti-sites or interstitial positions or on lattice sites
adjacent to an impurity dopant, such as an ion vacancy, or the NC
surface.49 Our results provide a model
that correlates the oxidation state of the Cu cations involved in
the radiative transition to the optical properties in ternary nanocrystals
and also offer additional tools to tune the characteristic features
of this interesting class of materials.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we probe and tune the distribution of Cu+ and
Cu2+ trap states in ternary CuInS2 nanocrystals
by in situ photoluminescence spectroelectrochemistry.
We establish that the width of the “bright” Cu+ trap-state distribution in the ensemble correlates with the PL line
width, which we can tune by electron injection or extraction. Electron
injection and extraction also affect the PL peak position, shifting
it to lower energy in the case of electron injection and higher energy
when electrons are extracted. Finally, the PL increases in intensity
and broadens when electrons are injected, whereas it decreases in
intensity and becomes narrower when electrons are extracted. Based
on these findings, we propose that efficient hole trapping on Cu+ defects is crucial for “bright” CIS NCs. Efficient
hole trapping can be activated by injecting electrons into the “dark”
defect states (Cu2+), thereby also broadening the distribution
of active trap states (Cu+) within the ensemble of CIS
NCs. Furthermore, we find that electrochemical oxidation of a Cu+-related trap state into Cu2+, reduces the PL intensity
due to an efficient Auger recombination pathway of the photogenerated
valence band hole. Our model shows a direct correlation between trap-state
distribution and PL line width, peak maximum and intensity, and the
oxidation state of the Cu-related defects, which contributes to understanding
the characteristic features of ternary NCs (i.e.,
low quantum yield, large global Stokes shift, and broad PL line width)
and provides a toolkit to control and manipulate these characteristics
for the envisioned application.

Methods
Materials
Copper(I) iodide (CuI, 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich),
indium acetate (InAc3, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-dodecanethiol
(DDT, >98%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanedithiol (EDT, >98%, Sigma-Aldrich),
indium-doped tin oxide substrates (ITO, ∼ 25 nm film thickness, Rsq ≤ 120 Ω/cm,2 PGO Germany), thin Indium-doped tin oxide substrates (ITO,
∼25 nm film thickness, total substrate thickness of ∼100
μm, Rsq ≤ 120 Ω/cm,2 PGO Germany), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and ferrocene (Fc, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich)
were used. Anhydrous solvents (methanol, 99.8%; butanol, 99.8%; and
toluene, 99.8%) and acetonitrile (99.99%) were all purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile was dried before use in an Innovative
Technology PureSolv Micro column. All other chemicals were used as
received.

Synthesis of CuInS2 Nanocrystals
The CuInS2 (CIS) nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized according to a
protocol from literature.6 In a typical
synthesis, 1 mmol indium acetate (0.292 g) and 1 mmol copper(I) iodide
(0.190 g) were mixed in a three-necked flask with 10 mL 1-dodecanethiol
(DDT). The mixture was degassed and purged with nitrogen (N2) three times under stirring. The flask was heated to 100 °C
until a clear solution had formed and subsequently heated further
to 230 °C. The NCs were grown for varying growth times to obtain
colloidal dispersions with different sizes of CIS NCs (growth times
of 5, 12, 15, and 30 min). The flask was cooled with an air gun to
below 100 °C and quenched by the addition of 5 mL of anhydrous
toluene. The NCs were precipitated in a 1:1:1 mixture of crude solution/methanol/butanol
upon centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Afterward, the supernatant
was discarded and the NCs were redispersed in toluene. These washing
steps were repeated three times.

CuInS2 NC film
Preparation
The CuInS2 (CIS) NC films were prepared
in a N2-purged glovebox
using a dip coater from Nima Technology. Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)
covered glass plates were consecutively dipped for 30 s in a concentrated
colloidal dispersion of CIS NCs, a 14 v% solution of ethanedithiol
(EDT) ligands in methanol to cross-link the NCs, and a methanol solution
to remove the excess, unbound ligands. The above-mentioned procedure
was repeated 10 times to obtain sufficiently thick NC films. Afterward,
the plates were dried for an hour inside the glovebox. The CIS NC
films on ITO were used as working electrode (WE) in the spectroelectrochemical
measurements described below.

(Spectro)electrochemistry
The (spectro)electrochemical
experiments were performed in a three electrode electrochemical cell,
consisting of a Ag wire pseudoreference electrode (PRE), a platinum
(Pt) plate counter electrode (CE), and the above-mentioned CIS–ITO
WE. All experiments were performed inside a N2-purged glovebox.
The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) in acetonitrile solution. A PGSTAT128N Autolab potentiostat
was used to regulate the potential and measure the current. Cyclic
voltammograms were recorded with a scan speed of 0.05 V/s. The Ag-wire
PRE was calibrated with a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple between
applied potentials of −1.0 and +1.5 V at a scan rate of 0.05
V/s (Ag PRE versus vacuum: −4.71 V).26,51 During the electrochemical charging, differential absorbance spectra
were recorded on a USB2000+ spectrometer (Ocean Optics, range 200
to 1025 nm) and detected with optical fibers. The white light source
was a DH-2000 deuterium halogen UV–vis–NIR Lightsource
from Ocean Optics. A background correction was made with a blank ITO
plate prior to measurements. A photograph and a schematic of the setup
can be found in Figure S14.

In
Situ Photoluminescence Spectroelectrochemistry
The
same electrochemical cell and detector as described above were
used for the in situ photoluminescence experiments.
The sample was excited with a 405 nm Thorlabs laser under a 45°
angle with respect to the sample and focused onto the sample with
a lens. The PL was detected perpendicular to the sample. Furthermore,
the PL was focused onto the detection fiber by two lenses. A photograph
and schematic of the setup can be found in Figure S15.

Ex Situ Optical Spectroscopy
Ex situ optical measurements were performed on
diluted colloidal
dispersions in toluene. Samples were prepared by diluting the stock
solution of washed NCs with anhydrous toluene under nitrogen. Samples
were stored in closed quartz cuvettes. Absorption spectra were measured
on a double-beam PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV–vis spectrometer.
Photoluminescence spectra and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY)
measurements were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrofluorimeter
equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp as excitation source and double grating
monochromators.

X-ray Diffractometry
XRD measurements
were performed
with a Bruker D8 DISCOVER, equipped with a Cu K-α X-ray source
(λ = 1.5418 Å), under grazing incidence conditions (angle
of incidence of 1°), to minimize the contribution from the ITO
substrate. The CIS–ITO electrode described above was used for
the XRD measurements.

X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy and
Extended X-ray Absorption
Fine Structure
Cu K-edge (8.979 keV) XANES and EXAFS spectra
of the solid and liquid samples containing CuInS2 nanocrystals
were collected at the Dutch-Belgian Beamline (DUBBLE) at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).52 The energy of the X-ray beam was tuned by a double-crystal monochromator
operating in fixed-exit mode using a Si(111) crystal pair. The samples
were measured at 25 °C in 1 mm quartz capillaries (for solutions),
and the CIS–ITO WE described above was used as solid sample.
EXAFS spectra were collected in transmission mode using Ar/He-filled
ionization chambers at ambient temperature and pressure. The XANES
spectra were collected in an electrochemical cell designed for in situ X-ray absorption measurements in transmission mode
(Figure S12). The optical path length through
the electrolyte solution was kept minimal (∼3 mm) to ensure
high intensity. Thin ITO–quartz plates were used to avoid X-ray
absorption by the quartz.

Simulations of XANES Spectra
The
results of the simulations
of copper atoms are based on the theoretical approach implemented
in the relativistic, self-consistent FEFF8 code. The cluster size
of the multiple scattering calculations is specified by the FMS card
and that for the self-consistent field calculations by the SCF card
in the input file. Default values of other input options were used.
The only nonstandard input to FEFF8 were the EXCHANGE card (EXCHANGE
0 0 0.2), indicating that the calculations are carried out using the
Hedin-Lundqvist/Dirac-Hara plasmon pole self-energy, without shifts
and with some additional broadening (0.20 eV), and the INTERSTITIAL
card (0 2.83) due to the interstitial potential useful for open systems.
These parameters usually agree better with experimental results.53
