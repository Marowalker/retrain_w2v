Light-induced stimulation of neurons via photoactive surfaces offers rich opportunities for the
development of therapeutic methods and high-resolution retinal prosthetic
devices. Quantum dots serve as an attractive building block for such
surfaces, as they can be easily functionalized to match the biocompatibility
and charge transport requirements of cell stimulation. Although indium-based
colloidal quantum dots with type-I band alignment have attracted significant
attention as a nontoxic alternative to cadmium-based ones, little
attention has been paid to their photovoltaic potential as type-II
heterostructures. Herein, we demonstrate type-II indium phosphide/zinc
oxide core/shell quantum dots that are incorporated into a photoelectrode
structure for neural photostimulation. This induces a hyperpolarizing
bioelectrical current that triggers the firing of a single neural
cell at 4 μW mm–2, 26-fold lower than the
ocular safety limit for continuous exposure to visible light. These
findings show that nanomaterials can induce a biocompatible and effective
biological junction and can introduce a route in the use of quantum
dots in photoelectrode architectures for artificial retinal prostheses.

==== Body
Stimulation of the neural tissue
and cells can treat a wide range of common and severe health problems,
including hearing loss, chronic pain, incontinence, obesity, diabetes,
and retinal degeneration.1 Light offers
an effective way of communication with such biological systems, and
light-induced cell stimulation offers many opportunities from cell
culture and neural network analysis in vitro to sensing
and regulation in vivo.(2−5) Light-induced stimulation can be achieved
either by genetic modification of the cellular membrane or by extracellular
excitation via prosthetic devices and photoactive
surfaces.6−8 These photoactive layers have the advantages of high
spatial resolution and simple fabrication combined with strong electrical
stimulation of neurons, and nanomaterials offer adjustable compositional
and electronic properties that can meet the needs of the biocompatibility
and charge transport requirements of the neural interfaces.

Discovery of the quantum confinement effect in semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs)9−11 and introduction of chemical synthesis methods for
them12−15 have extended their application area in LEDs,16−21 transistors,22 detectors,23 biological labeling,24,25 bioassays26,27 and in vivo imaging;28 in addition, QDs also have significant potential
in neural photostimulation due to their exceptional spectral sensitivity
and stability.29 Even though cadmium- and
mercury-based QDs have been reported for neural interfaces,30,31 indium phosphide (InP)-based quantum dots are accepted as a promising
alternative due to their reduced toxicity32−34 and tunable
photoluminescence (PL) covering the blue to near-infrared.35,36 Various materials were grown on the InP core as an outer shell (see
the list in Table S1 in the Supporting Information) to suppress nonradiative losses in surface trap states and confine
both electrons and holes in the core to obtain narrower PL line widths
and increased fluorescence quantum yield.37−40

Quantum dots with type-II
band alignments, in which the charge carriers start to be delocalized
from each other, provide benefits for optical gain,41 photocurrent generation,42 and
emission wavelength tunability.43 However,
the reported type-II heterostructures generally include highly toxic
cadmium content (see Table S2). Zinc oxide
(ZnO) has the potential to form a type-II band alignment by incorporation
onto an InP core as we reported previously (see Figure 1a).44 ZnO is a
wide band gap semiconductor (3.37 eV45),
which has been used for gas sensors, varistors, generators of surface
acoustic waves, and solar cells due to its optical, acoustic, and
electric properties.46−48 Advantageously, it has high radiation, chemical,
and thermal resistance;46 in addition,
it shows higher biocompatibility compared to nonoxide materials and
has been used for various biological applications.49,50 Moreover, it can provide an oxidation-resistant protective and electron-transporting
layer on the InP core. Previously, we demonstrated efficient luminescent
solar concentrators (LSCs) based on these type-II QDs.44 But, to the best of our knowledge, there is
no previous report in the literature of biocompatible indium-based
type-II QDs for neural interfaces.

In this study, we propose
and demonstrate biocompatible indium-based QDs with type-II band alignment
for neural interfaces. We describe the synthesis and characterization
of the QDs, consisting of an InP core surrounded by a crystalline
ZnO shell. Due to the photovoltaic and photoconduction potential of
type-II heterostructures, the quantum dots are integrated into a photoelectrode
structure, and the biocompatible material content of the electrode
allowed the growth and differentiation of cells on it. Upon illumination,
the photoelectrode generates an extracellular current that successfully
hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and stimulates an action potential.

Results
and Discussion
Strategy for the Synthesis of InP/ZnO Core/Shell
QDs
To grow thick and defect-free shells, a lower lattice
mismatch across a heterojunction is desirable. Even though the lattice
mismatch between InP and ZnO is 11%, which is higher than the well-known
InP/ZnS lattice mismatch (∼8%),51 a type-II heterostructure of CdTe/ZnSe with a higher lattice mismatch
of up to 14% has already been reported that exhibits excellent optical
and electronic properties.52 Therefore,
the lattice mismatch between InP and ZnO is at a level that can facilitate
crystal growth. Moreover, the surface chemistry plays a critical role
in the synthesis of QD heterostructures. Various reaction additives
were reported in the literature to improve the quantum yield and broad
size distribution of InP QDs, by addressing the affinity of InP for
covalent binding and the oxidation sensitivity of the reactant precursors.53 Among these methods, Nann provided a simple
method to obtain highly luminescent InP cores using zinc carboxylates
for surface passivation.38 The addition
of zinc carboxylates, such as zinc undecylenate, passivates surface
dangling bonds and improves solubility of the InP core QDs. Hence,
we selected the use of Nann’s method for the initial growth
of the InP core.

For growing the ZnO shell, we used the thermal
decomposition of zinc acetylacetonate as we reported previously.44 Thermal decomposition of zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2) and zinc acetylacetonate (Zn(acac)2) has been
reported in the literature for the synthesis of ZnO QDs.44,54−58 To obtain smaller and more monodisperse ZnO QDs with weaker trap
emission, Zn(acac)2 was chosen as a zinc precursor.58 Moreover, oleylamine (OAM) as stabilizing agent
prevents ZnO grains from aggregating.56 Briefly, InP cores were first synthesized by hot injection of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine
(P(TMS)3) on indium chloride (InCl3) in the
presence of OAM and oleic acid (OA) ligands with 1-octadecene (ODE) as the solvent.
After the core formation, the shell precursor, consisting of Zn(acac)2, OAM, OA, and ODE, was added to the InP core solution. Thermal
decomposition of Zn(acac)2 occurred by heating the solution,
which allowed the formation of a ZnO shell on the InP core (Figure 1b) (see the Methods section for the detailed synthesis procedure).

Structural Analysis
The final InP/ZnO heterostructure has cubic InP and hexagonal ZnO
crystal structures according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
(Figure 2a). The major
peaks correspond to the (111), (200), (220), and (222) crystalline
planes of the cubic phase of InP (PDF 00-013-02-32). The three diffraction
peaks of the hexagonal ZnO crystal structure (PDF 00-036-1451) are
shown in the (100), (101), and (102) planes. The shoulders beside
the (111) and (220) planes of InP, which are marked by a star, may
be due to the impurities.38,44 The narrow peaks reflect
a high degree of crystallinity. All major peaks of the InP/ZnO heterostructure
experience a shift toward higher angles, indicating a decreased average
lattice parameter. It comes from the fact that the ZnO lattice constant
(5.20 Å) is smaller than that of cubic InP (5.86 Å).

Bright-field high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM)
images confirmed the size of the InP core (Figure 2b) and InP/ZnO (Figures 2c, S1) QDs to
be 2.6 ± 0.34 and 3.58 ± 0.39 nm, respectively. To prove
the existence of InP and ZnO crystal structures, we identified the
spatial frequencies corresponding to crystalline planes contributing
to the quantum dot images by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis
performed on the HRTEM image (Figure 2a, inset). The spots of high spatial frequency in the
FFT pattern were identified to be consistent with the (111) of InP
(PDF 00-013-02-32) and the low-index planes of ZnO (PDF 00-036-1451)
(Figure 1a, inset).

Quantum Mechanical Calculations and Optical Analysis
We
analyzed the electronic properties of a single InP core and InP/ZnO
core/shell QD structures by solving the Schrödinger and Poisson
equations under the effective mass approximation and the BenDaniel–Duke
boundary condition (details are provided in the Supporting Information). The band offsets in conduction and
valence bands of InP/ZnO QD are determined as 0.100 and 2.12 eV, respectively,
by means of the experimental affinity values. All material parameters
used in the calculations are listed in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. The details of the calculations
can be found elsewhere.59 The initial InP
core quantum dot shows a type-I alignment due to the high finite confinement
potential model for the ligand and the solution environment. In this
structure, both excited charges, the electron and hole, are confined
in the same spatial region, which enables an attractive Coulomb potential
between the electron and hole of 146 meV. In addition, the electron
shows higher confinement energy (0.900 eV) in comparison with the
hole (0.246 eV) due to the lower electron mass (Figure 3a). These features lead to an effective band
gap energy between 1S electron and hole energy states corresponding
to 470 nm, which is close to the kink of the experimentally measured
absorption spectrum due to the lowest-energy 1S states (Figure 3c). After a ZnO shell layer
is grown on top of the InP core, the structure starts to transition
toward a type-II alignment. While the hole is confined in the InP
core, the electron wave function is repelled toward the ZnO shell
due to its lower conduction band ground state energy. Therefore, as
the band alignment shifts to a type-II structure, the electron delocalizes
across the entire quantum dot and the hole is strongly confined in
the core, leading to a quasi-type-II behavior (Figure 3b). Thus, the electron confinement energy
and the exciton binding energy significantly decrease to 0.472 eV
and 115 meV, respectively, while the hole confinement energy increases
to 0.286 eV. This is because the attractive Coulomb potential decreases
with increasing the size of the structure. Thus, a total 75 ±
8 nm red-shift becomes apparent in the absorption and luminescence
spectra (Figure 3c),
while the heterostructure transforms from an InP core to an InP/ZnO
core/shell structure. Moreover, the overlap of the wave functions
becomes lower (0.68) in comparison with the type-I InP core quantum
dot structure (0.96). Since the radiative lifetime is inversely affected
by the wave function overlap integral, the measured average lifetime
increases (Figure 3d). PL decays were fit by a two-exponential decay, and the average
lifetime was calculated from an intensity-weighted mean.60 Therefore, the transition from a type-I to a
quasi-type-II wave function confinement is responsible for the red-shift
and lifetime increase in the observed shift in the spectral and temporal
luminescence characteristics. Moreover, ZnO shell growth passivates
the InP core surface and enhances the quantum yield from 9.27 ±
1.7% (for the InP core) to 29.1 ± 2.8% (for InP/ZnO). The effect
of the ZnO shell thickness on the QY was discussed in our previous
study in detail.44

Photocurrent Measurement
Heterostructures with type-II band alignment are appropriate for
charge disassociation and photocurrent generation. For such purposes,
we prepared photoelectrodes by attaching the InP/ZnO QDs onto indium
tin oxide (ITO) substrates with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA)-modified
titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (Figure 4a). 3-MPA is a bifunctional
linker molecule, which has both carboxylate and thiol functional groups.
It can facilitate binding between InP/ZnO QDs and a TiO2 film,61−63 and it can help monolayer coverage of the InP/ZnO
film on the TiO2 network.64 Initially
absorption generates electron–hole pairs in the InP/ZnO QDs.
Since the linker is a short chain molecule (≈6 Å65), it positions the InP/ZnO and TiO2 nanomaterials in close proximity and enables strong interparticle
interaction. Because the difference between the two conduction band
energy levels of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE66) and InP/ZnO (−0.8 V versus NHE67) leads to the coupling
of an excited electron to an available state in TiO2, the
electron is expected to be transferred from InP/ZnO to TiO2 and from TiO2 to ITO (see Figure 4b). This result implies that the main contribution
to the current originates from the photoinduced electron transfer.

steps. (b) Band diagram of the InP/ZnO QD, TiO2,67 and ITO68 (InP/ZnO
QD energy levels were derived from the quantum mechanical calculations).

The excited-state interaction
of InP/ZnO QD, TiO2, and oxygen in the environment leads
to a speeding up of the time-resolved PL decay. The average lifetime
of the InP/ZnO QD decreased after anchoring onto TiO2 particles,
validating the charge transfer to TiO2 (Figure 5a).64 We can estimate the charge-transfer rate constant using eq 1, which is around 4.01
× 107 s–1. Moreover, holes scavenged
by the redox couple are also responsible for photocurrent generation. 1

measured for the bare TiO2, InP core based photoelectrode,
and InP/ZnO-based photoelectrode. The photocurrent of three different
samples and three different points was measured to report average
and error bar values.

The photocurrent
produced by the photoelectrode was measured with the electrophysiology
system amplifier operated in voltage clamp mode. The photocurrent
direction is from the photoelectrode toward the Ag/Cl wire of the
pipet, indicative of a reduction process or electron uptake from the
electrolyte by the photoanode.67 A typical
photocurrent response showed an ionic current of 3.40 ± 0.48
nA for InP/ZnO-based photoelectrode, generated with 4 μW/mm2 input and 450 nm LED light power (Figure 5b). Under the same irradiation level, TiO2 nanoparticles alone on the ITO substrate showed a photocurrent
of 128 ± 30 pA, being approximately 1 order of magnitude lower
than that of the photoelectrode. The InP core based photoelectrode
shows a lower photocurrent response (476 ± 47 pA) compared with
InP/ZnO (Figures 5c
and S3). The slow photocurrent rise in Figure 5b is possibly due
to slow hole scavenging. To show the lack of internal reactions/degradation
in QDs during illumination, we illuminated the photoelectrodes (450
nm, 4 μW/mm2) for 60 min, and the photoelectrode
did not show any degradation.

Cell Viability and Cytotoxicity Assessment
To evaluate the
feasibility of the InP/ZnO photoelectrode for neural interfacing,
we first investigated the toxicity of the photoelectrode on Neuro2A
cells. As shown in Figure 6a, the photoelectrode did not exhibit any toxic effect on
the cells by measuring the mitochondrial activity with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) under either dark or blue light conditions. We, then,
investigated the effect of the photoelectrode on membrane integrity
of the cells by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The membrane
integrity of the cells grown on a photoelectrode and ITO control had
a comparable amount of LDH activity in media at different time points,
which suggested that the photoelectrode statistically did not have
any effect on the membrane integrity (Figure 6b). Finally, the morphology of the cells
grown on the photoelectrode and ITO control was examined by fluorescence
microscopy. As can be seen in Figure 6c, the morphologies of the cells grown on the both
the photoelectrode and ITO control were identical as assessed by DAPI
and actin staining.

differences are presented as “ns”. (c) Effect of the
photoelectrode on the cell morphology visualized by fluorescence microscopy

Neural Photostimulation
Anode break stimulation has been reported for heart and nerve cells,
which originates from hyperpolarization-activated cation currents.69−72 Injection of a long anodic pulse into the cell can cause this phenomenon.
The hyperpolarization as a result of the anode current initiates an
action potential by decreasing the potassium conductance, which leads
to removing inactivation.69,70Equation 2 describes the time-dependent membrane,72 in which V, VK, VNa, VL,CM, gK, gNa, and gL are membrane potential, potassium resting potential, sodium
resting potential, leakage resting potential, membrane capacitance,
potassium conductance, sodium conductance, and leakage conductance,
respectively. All material parameters used in the calculations are
listed in Table S4 of the Supporting Information. 2  

The probability functions of m, n, and h depend on the membrane
potential and can be calculated from the activation and inactivation
rate constants.



To explain the anode break excitation, we
simulated the H–H model for a giant squid axon. Figure S4 shows the generated action potential
as a result of anodic current. When the membrane potential is changed
from a negative value toward zero, the activation function of n increases and the inactivation gate of h drastically drops (Figure S4a–d). The increase of the n parameter leads to both
higher potassium current (Figure S4f) and
a decrease of inactivation function of h, which subsequently
causes an opening of sodium channels (and an increase of the sodium
current in Figure S4e) and firing of an
action potential.

We use the photoelectrode for neural photostimulation via the transduction of energy from photons to electrons. Figure 7a shows the setup
used to measure the photostimulation of neurons: the electrophysiology
system for cell membrane potential recording, the photoelectrode (InP/ZnO–TiO2–ITO substrate) for photostimulation of the cells,
and an LED light source for light illumination. PC12 cells were grown
on the photoanode and differentiated via nerve growth
factor (NGF) treatment, which has been reported before for differentiated
PC12 cells on regular sterile plates.73Figure 7b and c show
a single whole cell recording for measuring both excitability of cells
and photostimulation investigation and action potential generation
under the current clamp technique, respectively. The input current
level of 350 pA was observed to be the threshold for firing an action
potential, after sweeping different levels of injection currents.
In a current clamp mode configuration, we studied the photostimulation
effect on the membrane voltage. As introduced in the photocurrent
discussion, the photocurrent is anodic, which needs to generate a
negative potential on the membrane. Thus, a light pulse with an intensity
of 4 μW/mm2 enabled hyperpolarization of the membrane
and fired a single neural cell. We repeated the hyperpolarization-induced
photostimulation for N = 4, and the membrane hyperpolarization
was found to be −45 ± 10 mV at 4 μW/mm2. For example, a similar neural stimulation mechanism based on hyperpolarization
has been already proposed and measured for retinal neural cells.74,75 Since the hyperpolarization strength is directly proportional to
the photocurrent level, the spectral regions that have lower absorption
will generate lower photocurrent, and hence they require higher intensity
levels to stimulate a neuron. Therefore, we measured the photocurrent
response of the photoelectrode at different excitation colors. The
maximum photocurrent can be observed under blue light in comparison
with green and red excitation colors due to stronger absorption at
shorter wavelengths. From this measurement, we expect that at 550
nm 3.5-fold and at 650 nm 30.5-fold higher light intensity are required
(Figure S7).

and recording setup. (b) Photograph of a patch-clamped PC12 cell.

mode in the dark. (d) Photostimulation of a PC12 cell on the photoelectrode

4 μW/mm2; blue bar: the time period in the dark.)

Advantageously the light intensity
of the photoanode that induces stimulation by a blue excitation is
26-fold lower than the ocular safety limit for continuous exposure
to visible light (106.93 μW/mm2), and it is also
in the range of the daylight retinal irradiance (0.1–10 μW/mm2).76,77 The intensity level that generates
an action potential is also significantly lower than the previous
report, which uses quantum dots for neural photostimulation.78 For example, HgTe (and CdTe) nanocrystal layers
have been used to stimulate the neurons.30,31 However, the cell stimulation by those films was observed from 2
to 8 mW/mm2, which is approximately 18–75 times
higher than the ocular safety limit for continuous exposure to visible
light.76 Herein, the light sensitivity
for neurostimulation is enhanced due to the energy gradient between
type-II quantum dots and the photoelectrode and due to improved photovoltaic
property (electron–hole separation) of type-II quantum dots.
In addition, the highly toxic cadmium and tellerium content of quantum
dots in the previous reports may be adversely affecting the electronic
coupling between the quantum dot layer and the cell. Moreover, no
interfacial layer (e.g., polylysine,
poly(acrylic acid)/polylysine) is used to enhance the biocompatibility
and promote cell attachment.30 Hence, the
biocompatibility of type-II InP/ZnO quantum dots in a photoelectrode
structure facilitated a reliable and effective bionanojunction.

Conclusions
In conclusion, type-II InP/ZnO core/shell QDs
were synthesized and used in a photoelectrode architecture for neural
interfaces. The quantum dot structure of an InP core and ZnO shell
was proved by crystallographic, structural, and optical analyses,
supported by quantum mechanical simulations. We incorporated these
QDs into a photoanode structure to build a photoactive surface, and
neural cells were successfully grown and differentiated on the photoelectrode,
with preservation of its optoelectronic functionality. The photoelectrode
effectively hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and stimulates an action
potential at an irradiance level lower than the ocular safety limit.
Therefore, this study introduces biocompatible quantum dot based neural
interfaces.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of the InP/ZnO
QDs
Chemicals
Zinc undecylenate (99%), oleic acid (OA) (99%),
oleylamine (OAM) (99%), 1-octadecene (ODE) (90%), indium chloride
(InCl3) (99%), Tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine (P(TMS)3) (95%), and zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (Zn(acac)2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ODE was purified at 100 °C
by evacuation and refilling with nitrogen for 1 h. All the procedures
were performed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox with an O2 level below 1 ppm using anhydrous solvents.

InP Core
First, 86 mg of zinc undecylenate, 44 mg of InCl3, 64
μL of OA, and 133 μL of OAM were mixed with 6 mL of ODE
(5 < pH < 6) and heated to 100 °C. The flask was evacuated
and refilled with nitrogen to provide an oxygen- and water-free reaction
atmosphere. Then, it was heated to 220 °C (10 °C/min), and
1 mL of phosphine stock solution (P(TMS)3-ODE 0.2 mmol
mL–1) was swiftly injected to the solution. The
solution was kept at 190 °C for 20 min and then cooled to room
temperature.

InP/ZnO Core/Shell
For the preparation
of a ZnO stock solution, 17 mg of Zn(acac)2, 22 μL
of OA, and 660 μL of OAM were mixed in 4 mL of ODE at 60 °C.
Then, 800 μL of ZnO stock solution was added to the above InP
solution at 60 °C. The solution was heated to 290 °C and
stirred for 20 min. Finally, it was cooled to room temperature.

Purification and Storage
After adding 1:1 ethanol/acetone
to the final QD solution, it was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 15 min
two times. The precipitated QDs were dispersed in hexane and kept
at 5 °C.

Photoelectrode Preparation
Chemicals
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) (99%), 2-propanol (IPA), and hydrochloric
acid fuming (HCl) (37%) were purchased from Merck, and 3-mercaptopropionic
(≥99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

TiO2 Films
A sol–gel dip-coating method was used to prepare
TiO2 films as reported previously.79 The preparation of TiO2 sol is as follows: TTIP was dissolved
in IPA and HCl with a molar ratio of IPA:TTIP:HCl equal to 20:1:0.1
under magnetic stirring at 25 °C. The resulting sol was mixed
and vigorously stirred for 6 h. The synthesized TiO2 particles
show a fully anatase crystal structure (Figure S2). A KSV NIMA dip-coater was used to coat TiO2 on ITO slides (20 mm × 20 mm × 1.2 mm). The dipping and
withdrawal speed were fixed at 150 mm min–1. Finally,
films were dried at 70 °C for 1 h and heat treated at 450 °C
for 2 h.

InP/ZnO Attachment on the TiO2
The TiO2 films were immersed in a 1 M 3-MPA
acetonitrile solution for 1 day, then rinsed thoroughly with acetonitrile
and toluene before being transferred to the QD solution. Finally,
they were left in the QD solution for 3 days to ensure saturated adsorption
of the QD onto the TiO2.

Biological Experiments
Cell
Growth
PC12 Adh and Neuro2A cell lines were used in electrophysiology
and biocompatibility experiments, respectively. Neuro2A cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
Gibco 21969-035) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco 10500), 1% l-glutamine (Gibco, 25030–081),
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco 15240-062). Cultures
were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 85% humidified
incubator. Every 2–3 days, cells were subcultured and supplied
with fresh medium. PC12 Adh cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAN
Biotech, P04-16500) medium supplemented with 10% donor horse serum
(PAN Biotech, P30-0701HI), 5% FBS, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
Cells were plated in 100 mm polystyrene dishes and maintained at 37
°C in a 5% CO2 incubator with 85% humidity. Cultures
were passaged every 2–3 days with a subculture ratio of 1:3.

Cytotoxicity
Photoelectrodes were cut into square pieces
with a size of 0.40 × 0.40 cm and then sterilized as follows
before adding cells onto them: Substrates were first treated with
70% ethanol and then air-dried. Next, they were exposed to a UV-lamp
for 30 min for surface sterilization. Sterilized substrates were placed
in a sterile 96-well plate. Neuro2A cells were seeded into a 96-well
plate (1 × 104 cells per well) and cultured in DMEM
containing 10% FBS (100 μL) and incubated for 24 h (37 °C,
5% CO2). These experiments were performed under total darkness
and blue-light (450 nm blue LED, 500 μW/cm2) conditions.
To allow cell adherence, samples were incubated at 37 °C in a
5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Then the growth medium was replaced
with DMEM containing 1 mg/mL MTT solution to each well and further
incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the MTT media was removed
and EtOH/DMSO (200 μL) was added to each well. The optical density
(OD) was measured at 600 nm with a microplate reader (BioTek). The
relative cell viability was calculated as follows: viability = (ODsample/ODcontrol) × 100. The ODsample was obtained from the cells grown on a photoelectrode, and the ODcontrol was obtained from the cells grown on the ITO substrate.

LDH Leakage Assay
To assess the membrane integrity of the
Neuro2A cells in the presence and absence of the photoelectrode, an
LDH leakage assay (CytoSelect LDH cytotoxicity assay kit, CBA-241,
Cell Biolabs) was performed. Photoelectrodes were sterilized as described
in the cytotoxicity method. ITO substrates with dH2O and
with 1% Triton X-100 were used as positive and negative controls throughout
all experiments, respectively. After sterilization of the substrates,
they were placed in 96-well plates, and 1.6 × 104 cells
were seeded to each well. An LDH leakage assay was carried out as
described in the product manual. Briefly, plates were incubated at
37 °C in a time-dependent manner (for 24, 48, and 96 h). After
adding 1% Triton X-100 into negative control wells, 90 μL of
all samples was transferred into a new plate. Next, 10 μL of
LDH cytotoxicity assay reagent was added to each well. Plates were
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. The presence
of the LDH in media was measured at 450 nm by a Synergy H1 microplate
reader (BioTek). All experiments were repeated as at least three biological
replicates, and each biological replicate was carried out with three
technical triplicates.

Immunolabeling and Fluorescence Microscopy
Neuro2A cells were grown on photoelectrodes and ITO control substrates.
After 48 h, samples were fixed with methanol and washed three times
with PBS. Cells were blocked in PBS solution containing 3% bovine
serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated with mouse
anti-actin primary antibody and washed three times with PBS. Finally,
to visualize the nucleus and actin cytoskeleton of Neuro2A cells,
DAPI and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody
was added respectively and washed with PBS before mounting. Substrates
were mounted by Mowiol and imaged on a flouresence microscope (Zeiss-ObserverZ1)
using Zen 2 blue edition software (Zeiss).

Instrumentation
XRD
Multiple layers of QD solution were drop-cast on a glass substrate,
left to dry, and analyzed in a Bruker D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å).

TEM
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed using
a JEOL JEM-ARM200CFEG UHR microscope with a spherical aberration-corrected
probe and equipped with a Gatan Orius SC200D CCD camera. Bright-field
images were collected using an accelerating voltage of 200 keV. Specimens
for TEM analysis were prepared by first placing a 10 μL droplet
of aqueous suspension of single-layer graphene oxide (CheapTubes.com)
onto a holey carbon film on a copper support grid, followed by deposition
of a 10 μL droplet of ∼1 mM solution of nanocrystals
in hexane.

Absorbance and PL
Absorbance spectra
of the QDs were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer at 2 nm in the range of 400–700 nm. The steady-state
PL analysis was done with a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin
Yvon Horiba) with a 2 nm slit in the same range of absorbance at 375
nm excitation wavelength.

Time-Resolved PL
Fluorescence decay
was taken with a PicoQuant MicroTime 100 time-resolved confocal fluorescence
microscope. The excitation beam was provided by 8 mW picosecond diode
laser heads operating at 375 nm pulsed at a 20 MHz repetition rate.

Photocurrent Measurement
The photocurrent produced by the
photoanode was measured with an electrophysiology system amplifier
operated in voltage clamp mode with a patch pipet positioned closer
than 1 μm to the electrode surface, a blue LED (450 nm, 4 μW/mm2) served as a pulsed illumination source (LED’s spectrum
in Figure S5), and artificial cerebrospinal
fluid was used as electrolytic solution, which has around 80% transmittance
in the visible range (Figure S6). The photocurrent
of three different samples and three different points was measured
to report average and error bar values.

Electrophysiology Test
An EPC800 system made by HEKA was used for electrophysiology experiments.
Whole patch clamp recordings were used for the PC12 cell membrane
voltage and currents under GΩ seal condition with capillary
pipets (8–10 MΩ) at room temperature. Capillary pulled
glass electrodes contained a standard internal solution of 140 mM
NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA,
and 0.5 mM ATP, with pH adjusted using KOH to 7.2. The standard external
solution contained 128 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and
2.5 mM CaCl2, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH.
The same blue LED (450 nm, 4 μW/mm2) was used as
pulsed illumination source (LED’s spectrum in Figure S5).
