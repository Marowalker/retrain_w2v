Colloidal photonic
crystals display peculiar optical properties
that make them particularly suitable for application in different
fields. However, the low packing fraction of the targeted structures
usually poses a real challenge in the fabrication stage. Here, we
propose a route to colloidal photonic crystals via a binary mixture of hard tetramers and hard spheres. By combining
theory and computer simulations, we calculate the phase diagram as
well as the stacking diagram of the mixture and show that a colloidal
analogue of the MgCu2 Laves phase—which can serve
as a precursor of a photonic band-gap structure—is a thermodynamically
stable phase in a large region of the phase diagram. Our findings
show a relatively large coexistence region between the fluid and the
Laves phase, which is potentially accessible by experiments. Furthermore,
we determine the sedimentation behavior of the suggested mixture,
by identifying several stacking sequences in the sediment. Our work
uncovers a self-assembly path toward a photonic structure with a band
gap in the visible region.

==== Body
It is known
that colloidal particles
can spontaneously form ordered, periodic phases that are the analogue
of crystals in atomic systems. The most prominent example of such
a transition, first discovered by computer simulations1 and later confirmed by experimental work,2 is the formation of a face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystal
from a fluid of colloidal particles that behave as hard spheres.

The study of crystalline phases on colloidal length and time scales
is important not only at a fundamental level, where it allows for
insights into, for example, phase transitions and crystallization
kinetics,3,4 but also for potential applications. In
particular, it is possible to fabricate from colloidal particles photonic
crystals, which are structures with a periodically varying dielectric
constant that display a complete photonic band gap. Due to the intrinsic
size of the employed building blocks, colloidal photonic crystals
display a band gap in the visible range of frequencies. These structures
act for photons in the same way as semiconductors do for electrons,
hence opening up a way to control light propagation. The applicability
of such materials is quite broad, ranging from optical fibers, displays
and switches to (bio)sensing and biomedical engineering, and finally
to energy storage and security.5−8 Therefore, a significant amount of research in the
colloid science community deals with the design and fabrication of
such photonic crystals.

Since the early work on photonic crystals,9,10 different
particle arrangements were explored as candidates,11,12 and some of them—most notably the so-called “inverse
opals”—were also fabricated in the lab.13,14 To date, the most suitable candidates to make photonic crystals
remain the diamond crystal and the pyrochlore structure, in which
the colloids are located on the lattice positions of the respective
crystal structures.15,16 However, despite the efforts,
the fabrication of such open (non-close-packed) structures at the
colloidal scales has not been achieved yet, and it is a long-standing
research focus in the nanomaterials and colloid science community.

Nevertheless, new perspectives on the subject arise because the
recent advances in colloid synthesis allow for more and more exotic
building blocks to be used in the colloidal self-assembly arena. Clusters
of spheres with well-defined shapes, such as dimers, trimers, and
tetramers, have become available, together with the intriguing possibility
of employing them to self-assemble into photonic crystals.17−20 These colloidal clusters can be produced in several ways. One method
takes advantage of the drying forces in an evaporating emulsion droplet
to drive the confined colloidal particles to a specific geometry.17,18 A different class of fabrication procedures relies instead on microfluidics
setups, with or without the use of lithographically patterned surfaces.19

In addition, on the theoretical side,
two new ideas were put forward
to facilitate the fabrication of photonic crystals, and we shall briefly
discuss them in the following. One study showed that a structure composed
of tetrahedral clusters of spheres (“tetrastack”) displays
a photonic band gap in the optical region.21 However, while they employ a complex building block, it is not clear
how the suggested structure can be realized experimentally. Another
study suggested that, by using a binary mixture of colloidal particles
with different sizes, it is possible to assemble a MgCu2 Laves phase. This is appealing because the MgCu2 consists
of a diamond crystal of large spheres and a pyrochlore lattice of
small spheres, and both substructures display a photonic band gap.22 In this case, the authors addressed the problem
posed by the open structure by using a binary mixture of spheres.
Nevertheless, issues arise when one considers that three phases can
actually be assembled from a binary hard-sphere mixture, namely, the
MgCu2, the MgNi2, and the MgZn2.
It is also important to note that the latter is the thermodynamically
stable phase and unfortunately not the aimed-for MgCu2 phase.23 Furthermore, the three aforementioned Laves
phases are nearly degenerate, as they have very similar free energies;
hence the self-assembly of the mixture results in glassy states, unless
the assembly is directed, for example, by using templated walls.22

In this work, we combine Monte Carlo (MC)
computer simulations
and theoretical calculations to study the phase behavior of a binary
mixture of large hard spheres and rigid, hard tetrahedral clusters
of small hard spheres (hereafter denoted as tetramers) with a fixed
size ratio. For this mixture, we compute both the bulk phase diagram
and the sedimentation behavior. In particular, using free-energy calculations,
we address the stability of the MgCu2 Laves phase that
can result from the self-assembly of the mixture. In this way, we
retain the best of both approaches previously introduced, while also
circumventing some of the other problems. For instance, employing
a binary mixture mitigates the problem of the low-coordinated open
target structures of the diamond and pyrochlore phase, whereas using
tetramers as one of the building blocks alleviates the lattice degeneracy
problem, as the MgNi2 phase cannot be self-assembled from
tetramers and spheres. Moreover, using tetramers allows one to remove
the metastability problem since in this case the MgCu2 phase
becomes more stable than the MgZn2, as we shall show. Finally,
by using the bulk phase diagram and the local density approximation,
we theoretically calculate the stacking diagram of the mixture, which
predicts the stacking sequences of different phases that could be
observed in sedimentation experiments on the same mixture.

We
stress that such a model mixture is well within experimental
reach, even though no studies on it have been performed yet, to the
best of our knowledge. This is somewhat surprising, as hard-core systems
are usually much easier to control than systems with attractive interactions,
which often requires substantial fine-tuning of the range, strength,
and directionality of the interactions. However, it is important to
mention here that very recently the MgCu2 Laves phase was
found experimentally by using colloidal spheres and preassembled tetrahedral
clusters of spheres coated by DNA in order to induce short-range attractive
interactions between the unlike species.24

Results and Discussion
System and Model
Monte Carlo Simulations
We consider a binary mixture
of Ns hard spheres and Nt hard tetramers with composition x = Ns/N, where N = Ns + Nt. The spheres have diameter σL. Each tetramer consists
of four touching spherical beads of diameter σB arranged
in a tetrahedral fashion. We assume that the tetramers behave like
a rigid body; i.e., fluctuations in the geometrical
arrangement of the spheres are neglected. The size ratio between a
bead in a tetramer and a sphere is labeled as q =
σB/σL. Since the MgCu2 Laves phase of an ordinary binary hard-sphere mixture achieves its
highest packing fraction for ,22,23,25,26 we employ this value in our work.
All interactions are assumed to be hard-sphere-like, meaning that
the objects do not interpenetrate each other. Thus, spheres cannot
approach each other closer than σL, beads belonging
to different tetramers cannot approach each other closer than σB, spheres and tetramer beads cannot approach closer than σLB = (σL + σB)/2. The pressure P is measured in reduced units as βPσL3 where β = 1/kBT, kB is Boltzmann’s constant,
and T is the (irrelevant) system temperature. The
packing fraction is defined as η = γρ, where ρ
= N/V is the number density, V is the volume of the simulation box, and γ = πσL3[x + 4q3(1 – x)]/6.
The Gibbs free energy per particle is defined as g = βG/N = f + γβP/η, where f = βF/N is the dimensionless
Helmholtz free energy. More details on the simulations and the free-energy
calculations can be found in the SI. A
model of the different building blocks employed in this work is shown
in Figure 1.

spheres with diameter σL. (Center) Hard tetrahedral
clusters of spherical beads with size σB. Note that
the beads are tangential to one another. The size ratio q = σB/σL is fixed to 0.82. (Right)

Crystalline Structures
For a binary hard-sphere mixture,
previous studies have shown that, at the chosen size ratio q = σB/σL = 0.82, the
stable crystal structures are the pure FCC crystals of large and of
small spheres and the MgNi2, MgCu2, and MgZn2 Laves phases,22,23 where the MgZn2 phase
has a slightly lower free energy than the other two. In the case of
a mixture of tetramers and spheres, we employ the same packing arrangements
as those in ref (23), but we replace four small spheres by a tetramer. This procedure
yields structures that are made from the investigated building blocks
(spheres and tetramers), but are arranged similarly to the respective
literature cases. In particular, the FCC of small spheres at x = 0 becomes a simple cubic crystal lattice of tetramers.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the third kind of Laves
phase—the MgNi2 crystal—cannot be reproduced
by a combination of tetramers and spheres; hence it falls already
out of the picture when considering candidate crystal structures.
Summing up, for different compositions of large spheres x we haveSC, a
simple cubic lattice of tetramers
with specified orientation at composition x = 0;

LP1, a mixed structure of tetramers
and
spheres, which packs the same way as an ordinary MgCu2 lattice,
at composition x = 2/3;

LP2, the analogue of the MgZn2 crystal, but
made out of tetramers and spheres, also at composition x = 2/3. Note that this structure has a noncubic unit cell;

FCC, the thermodynamic stable
structure
for hard spheres, at composition x = 1.



Figure 2 Crystal structures considered in this work. (Top left) The simple
cubic crystal phase of hard tetramers (SC) at composition x = 0. (Top right) The binary MgCu2 Laves phase
(LP1) at composition x = 2/3. (Bottom left) The binary
MgZn2 Laves phase (LP2) at composition x = 2/3. (Bottom right) The face centered cubic crystals of large
spheres (FCC) at composition x = 1. The color code
identifies different tetramers and separates tetramers from spheres.

In the SC, LP1, and LP2 phases,
respectively, all the tetramers initially have the same orientation,
which is calculated by a rigid transformation of the bead positions
in the reference frame of the tetramers to the bead positions in the
crystal at hand. The SC phase can also be formed by stacking different
layers of tetramers on top of each other, in which the tetramers are
either shifted or rotated, nevertheless the positions of the beads
of the tetramers must always be compatible with an FCC packing. The
different crystal structures of the SC phase, which have been considered
in detail elsewhere,27 have very similar
free energies and do not affect the main results presented here concerning
the Laves phases nor the general topology of the phase diagram and
were therefore neglected. We also note here that
we exclude the possibility of an aperiodic crystal, in which the tetramers
are randomly oriented.

Stacking Sequences and Stacking Diagram
Once the bulk
equilibrium phase diagram is ascertained, we also study the sedimentation
behavior of the system. To this end, we theoretically construct a
stacking diagram that gives all possible stacking sequences of phases
in a sedimentation–diffusion equilibrium, following the method
recently presented in ref (28). The theory behind the construction of a stacking diagram
is based on chemical potentials, hence the bulk phase diagram in the P–x representation must first be
converted to the plane of chemical potential of the spheres (L) and
tetramers (T), respectively. In the following, we assume that such
a conversion has been done, and we discuss the method to determine
the stacking diagram only in terms of chemical potentials of the two
species.

Once gravity is switched on, an inhomogeneous sedimentation–diffusion
equilibrium profile is obtained in the direction of gravity z. Employing the local density approximation (LDA), we define
a local chemical potential μi(z) of species i = L, T, which depends linearly
on the height z in the sedimentation–diffuion
equilibrium: 1  where μi0 is the total chemical
potential of species i in the absence of gravity
in the system and mi is
the buoyant mass of species i. Rearranging eq 1 and eliminating the z-dependence, we obtain a linear relation between the chemical
potential of the spheres μL(z) and
the chemical potential of the tetramers μT(z) 2  where the slope s = mL/mT is the gravitational
variable, i.e., the buoyant mass
ratio of spheres and tetramers, and a = μL0 – sμT0 is the composition variable. For a given a and s, i.e.,
fixed overall composition and buoyant masses of the two species, eq 2 represents a straight
line in the phase diagram in the μT–μL representation. This straight line is called a “sedimentation
path”. The point at which a sedimentation path crosses a bulk
binodal represents an interface between two phases in the sedimentation
column. Therefore, each sedimentation path in the μT–μL phase diagram corresponds to a specific
stacking sequence of phases in the sedimentation column. Thus, the
stacking sequence is determined by the slope s, i.e., the ratio of the buoyant masses of
the two species, the direction of the sedimentation path denoted by
the sign of s, the overall composition and concentration
given by a, and the height of the sample. All possible
stacking sequences are summarized in a so-called stacking diagram.

Equations of State
The equations of state (EOS) of
both the fluid phase at different compositions x and
of the crystalline structures considered are a key ingredient of the
calculation of the phase diagram. For the fluid phase, we calculated
the EOSs at composition intervals of 0.1, whereas for the crystal
phases the compositions are fixed. In Figure 3 we show the EOSs of the different crystal
structures investigated, as well as the EOSs of the fluid mixture
at different compositions x. We fit the simulation
results to 3  for the fluid phase, and 4  for the crystal phases. The typical value
of n is 12, while m = 3 for all
cases. The fitting procedure allows us to easily perform the thermodynamic
integration as described in the SI.

(EOS) for a mixture of large hard spheres and hard tetramers at different
sphere compositions x = NS/N. The branches at high η correspond to the
studied solid structures, namely, SC at x = 0, LP1–MgCu2 and LP2–MgZn2 at x = 2/3,
and FCC at x = 1. Note that the EOSs of LP1 and LP2
coincide for high pressures, but differ at lower pressures. For visualization
purposes, the curves have been shifted with respect to each other
in the y direction by an amount Δy = 14.

Stability of LP1–MgCu2 and Phase Diagrams
Previous work on binary hard-sphere
mixtures has shown that the
MgZn2 Laves phase is more stable than the MgCu2 Laves phase.22,23 Unfortunately, the MgCu2 structure is the only Laves phase whose sublattices display a complete
photonic band gap.15,16 Hence, the first issue for us
to investigate is the thermodynamic stability of LP1–MgCu2 compared to LP2–MgZn2. We addressed this
by performing free-energy calculations at a fixed packing fraction
of η = 0.60 for different total number of particles N. By plotting the excess free energy per particle including
finite-size corrections versus 1/N for both structures, we can extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ by looking at the intercept of the two
lines. This is displayed in Figure 4, where it becomes clear that the LP1–MgCu2 structure of hard tetramers and hard spheres is more stable
than the LP2–MgZn2 structure in the thermodynamic
limit. The LP1 structure has a bulk excess free energy per particle
of 10.01(1)kBT, while
the LP2 crystal has an excess free energy per particle of 10.07(1)kBT, the difference being 6
× 10–2kBT. Incidentally, we note that this free-energy difference
is not at all small, being tens of times larger than the free-energy
difference between a face-centered-cubic and an hexagonal close-packing
of hard spheres. Thus, by employing a mixture of hard tetramers and
large hard spheres, the MgCu2 structure—the precursor
of colloidal photonic crystals—is stabilized in the bulk. In
view of this result, we will refer to LP1 more generically as the
“Laves phase” in the following.

Figure 4 Finite-size scaling of
the excess Helmholtz free energy fex +
ln(N)/Nvs 1/N at diameter ratio q = 0.82 and packing
fraction η = 0.6 for the LP1–MgCu2 and LP2–MgZn2 Laves structures of hard
tetramers and hard spheres. The lines are linear fits to the data
points. The LP1 crystal is always significantly more stable than the
LP2 structure, the free energy difference in the thermodynamic limit
being 6 × 10–2kBT per particle.

To draw the phase diagram in the pressure βPσL3–composition x representation, we
apply common tangent constructions
to the Gibbs free-energy curves g(P, x) at different pressures, in order to determine
the composition and densities of the coexisting phases. The results
are summarized in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Phase diagram of a binary mixture of hard spheres and hard tetramers
in the pressure βPσL3–composition x representation. The composition x = NS/N refers to the spheres. Two triple
points (Fluid+SC+Laves, Fluid+Laves+FCC) are found, together with
a relatively large phase coexistence region between the fluid and
the Laves phase.

For pressures βPσL3 ≤ 11.5, we find that the
fluid is the only stable phase. Increasing the pressure results in
different coexistence regions, between the fluid and the three crystal
structures investigated, and between the different crystal structures
at even higher pressures.

For 11.5 ≤ βPσL3 ≤
13.9
and compositions x > 0.81 we find phase coexistence
between the FCC crystal of large spheres and the fluid phase, while
for 17.0 ≤ βPσL3 ≤ 17.6 and compositions x < 0.17 we find a coexistence between the simple cubic
crystal of tetramers and the fluid phase.

Interestingly, at
intermediate pressures and compositions we observe
two distinct phase coexistence regions between the Laves phase and
the fluid phase with either a composition smaller or larger than that
of the Laves phase, i.e., x ≤ 2/3 and x ≥ 2/3. Moving
toward high pressures we find solid–solid coexistence between
the simple cubic phase of pure tetramers and the Laves phase and between
the Laves phase and the pure FCC phase of large spheres, the former
starting at somewhat higher pressures than the latter (βPσL3 > 17.6 vs βPσL3 > 13.9).

For very high pressures, we expect, due to packing considerations,
only a single coexistence region between the simple cubic phase of
tetramers and the FCC crystals of large spheres; i.e., we expect to find another triple point where the SC, Laves, and
FCC phases are in coexistence with each other. However, we were unable
to detect the crossover, even by simulating at pressures as high as
βPσL3 = 70.0. Thus, we can only set a lower limit
on this specific crystal–crystal phase coexistence region.

The relatively large two-phase coexistence region between the fluid
phase and the Laves phase is the most remarkable feature of the presented
phase diagram, signaling an extended and easily accessible parameter
range to obtain the targeted MgCu2 Laves phase in simulations
as well as in experiments. We checked the mechanical stability of
the phase coexistence between the fluid and the Laves phase by performing
direct coexistence simulations at overall compositions x = 0.5 and x = 0.6 and pressure βPσL3 =
15.0. In Figure 6 we
present snapshots of the final configurations as obtained from the
simulations, which confirm the coexistence between the fluid phase
and the Laves phase of tetramers and spheres.

configuration from direct coexistence simulations

Same as top panel, but with color coding to highlight the different
tetramers.

Despite the progress in the fabrication
of colloidal building blocks,
we are unaware, to the best of our knowledge, of experimental realizations
of the proposed binary mixture. In order to facilitate the comparison
with experimental results, we additionally convert the phase diagram
to the packing fraction of tetramers ηT–packing
fraction of spheres ηS representation, the result
being shown in Figure 7. The triple points we found in Figure 5—Fluid + SC + Laves, Fluid + Laves
+ FCC—transform to triangular areas in this representation.
In between the triple points we find the coexistence region between
fluid phase and Laves structure, which could be probed experimentally.
Finally, we also calculate the phase diagram in the chemical potential
of the spheres μL–chemical potential of the
tetramers μT representation. While this diagram is
not suitable for comparison with experiments, it is instead crucial
in order to theoretically address the role of gravity on the presented
bulk results, as accomplished in the next section.

investigated binary mixture in the packing
fraction of tetramers ηT–packing fraction
of large spheres ηL representation.

Sedimentation Behavior and Stacking Diagram
We now
study the system subject to a gravitational field. The phase diagram
in the chemical potential of the spheres μL–chemical
potential of the tetramers μT representation is shown
in Figure 8, where
full black lines represent bulk binodals. At each point on a binodal
two phases are in equilibrium with each other.

Figure 8 Phase diagram of a binary
mixture of hard tetramers and hard spheres
in the chemical potential of large hard spheres μL–chemical potential of hard tetramers μT representation.
The solid lines represent the bulk binodals and delimit single-phase
regions. The phase transitions of the pure system of spheres and the
pure system of tetramers are shown by the horizontal and vertical
asymptotic extensions of the respective binodals. The colored dashed
lines represent some of the possible phase-stacking sequences in the
sediment. The color code is the same as the one used for the stacking
diagram. The arrows on the dashed lines indicate the direction from
the bottom to the top of the sediment.

The bulk phase diagram in the μT–μL plane is used as an input for our theory in order to calculate
the stacking diagram in the a–s representation. Exemplarily, we show various sedimentation paths
in Figure 8, which
are straight lines in the μT–μL phase diagram. The different sedimentation paths correspond to different
stacking sequences, and the stacking diagram in the a–s representation summarizes the possible
phase sequences. The boundaries between the different regions in the
stacking diagram, each of which represents a different stacking sequence,
are determined by the following boundary curves.

Sedimentation
Binodal
This is the locus of all sedimentation
paths tangential to the bulk binodal(s) in the μT–μL phase diagram. We have five bulk binodals
in the μT–μL phase diagram
indicating the various coexistences as shown in Figure 8, thus giving five corresponding sedimentation
binodals in the stacking diagram.

Terminal Lines
This is the set of all sedimentation
paths through an end point of a bulk binodal in the μT–μL phase diagram, i.e., a triple point or a critical point. This end point corresponds
to a line in the stacking diagram. To see how this happens, let us
label such a point by its coordinates p = (μTterm, μLterm). Plugging
this into eq 2 and inverting
the resulting relation yields an equation for a as
a function of s, i.e., a = a(s). This equation represents
a so-called “terminal line” on the stacking diagram,
and it originates from the terminal point p. In the
bulk phase diagram of Figure 8 we have three terminal points:1. the triple point, visible in Figure 8, where the Laves,
fluid, and FCC phases coexist;

2. the triple point, visible in Figure 8, where the Laves,
fluid, and SC phases coexist;

3. the triple point, not visible in Figure 8, where the Laves,
FCC, and SC phases coexist. In order to locate this point in the plane
of the chemical potentials, we obtain the FCC–Laves and SC–Laves
binodals from simulations up to pressures βPσL3 =
70, and we extrapolate the last simulated points until the two binodals
meet.



Asymptotic Terminal Lines
This is the set of sedimentation
paths with the asymptotic slope of a bulk binodal in the μT–μL phase diagram that does not terminate
at a finite value of one of the chemical potentials. For example,
in our system the fluid–FCC binodal terminates in a horizontal
asymptote in the μT–μL phase
diagram as the chemical potential of the absent species (tetramers)
approaches −∞. Here, we remind the reader that the parameter s is the slope of the tangent to the bulk binodal, and in
the above-mentioned case s → 0. Thus, all
the possible sedimentation paths parallel to the horizontal asymptotic
bulk binodal of large hard spheres result in a vertical line on the
stacking diagram located at s = 0. Similarly, the
fluid–SC binodal terminates as a vertical asymptote in the
μT–μL phase diagram as the
chemical potential of the large hard spheres approaches −∞,
and hence this line corresponding to a line at s =
−∞ does not appear in the stacking diagram as presented
in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Stacking diagram
depicting the sedimentation–diffusion equilibrium
for the binary mixture of large hard sphere–hard tetramer.
The colored regions represent the different phase-stacking sequences
of phases observed in the sedimentation column. The labels list the
different phases in the sediment from bottom to top. Note that the
colors of the regions correspond to the colors of the sedimentation
paths drawn on the phase diagram in the μT–μL representation in Figure 8. For visualization purposes we have restricted the
axes to the region that contains the largest amount of stacking sequences.
Moreover, the a axis was linearly scaled with respect
to s by a constant c = −40,
such that a = aactual – cs.

By assembling these features together, we obtain the corresponding
stacking diagram of a system of large hard spheres and hard tetramers
undergoing sedimentation, shown in Figure 9. The differently colored regions in Figure 9 represent the different
stacking sequences for this binary mixture. The labels list the different
phases in the sediment from bottom to top. We remind the reader that s = mL/mT also equals the ratio of the buoyant masses of the spheres
to the tetramers, see eq 2. A negative s means that one species settles while
the other floats up. In the present work, we assume that the tetramers
always settle, which means that the buoyant mass of the tetramers
is always positive, i.e., mT > 0. Alternatively, if the identity of the settling species
is switched, the stacking sequences for the negative s region will simply be reversed. Keeping this in mind, the following
observations can be made about the resulting stacking diagram.1. For negative s, the
single-species crystal phase formed at the bottom is always the SC
phase of tetramers, as is expected. At the top of the sediment, we
find a single-species FCC phase, which can be explained by the values
for a corresponding to the overall concentrations
and compositions of the system as considered in the present stacking
diagram.

2. For s > 0, we find
always a fluid phase at the top of the sediment for the values of a considered here.

3. For s > 1, the FCC
crystal phase of large spheres is formed at the bottom, as the spheres
have a higher buoyant mass than the tetramers.

4. The regime 0.45 ≲ s = mL/mT ≲
1 is interesting because, although the tetramers are heavier, the
FCC crystal phase of large spheres is predicted to form at the base
of the column, which may seem counterintuitive. We explain this result
in terms of the total chemical potential difference between the large
spheres μL0 and the tetramers μT0, which favors the FCC crystal at the bottom
of the sediment.

5. We
found some counterintuitive stacking
sequences with up to six different phases in a sediment, such as SC–Fluid–Laves–Fluid–FCC–Fluid,
as well as floating phases with crystalline phases sandwiched between
two fluid phases,29 such as SC–Fluid–Laves–Fluid
or SC–Fluid–FCC–Fluid phase sequences.



Conclusions
We
investigated the phase behavior of a binary mixture of hard
spheres and hard tetramers consisting of beads arranged in a tetrahedral
fashion. By using MC simulations in the isobaric–isothermal
ensemble combined with free-energy calculations and the thermodynamic
integration method, we mapped out the bulk phase diagram of the mixture
in the pressure βPσL3–composition x representation.

We found phase coexistence regions between
the fluid phase and
various crystal structures, as well as two triple points, namely,
the Fluid+SC+Laves and the Fluid+Laves+FCC triple points. Surprisingly,
we find a relatively large coexistence region between the fluid and
the Laves phase, the structural analogue of the MgCu2 phase,
which may be experimentally accessible. In order to facilitate comparison
with experimental parameters, we also converted the phase diagram
from the pressure βPσL3–composition x representation to the packing fraction of tetramers ηT–packing fraction of spheres ηL plane.

Assuming the validity of the local density approximation under
relevant experimental conditions for our binary system, we also investigated
the sedimentation behavior by calculating the stacking diagram of
this mixture. Some of the stacking sequences are highly nontrivial,
displaying, for example, floating crystal phases.

Our results
demonstrate a self-assembly route toward a photonic
material where the diamond and the pyrochlore structures can be assembled
in one crystal—the MgCu2 Laves structure—from
a binary mixture of hard spheres and hard tetramers. By selectively
burning or dissolving one of the species, either the tetramers or
the spheres, the Laves phase can be converted into a diamond lattice
or a pyrochlore structure to obtain a photonic crystal with a band
gap in the visible range. We thus showed that the MgCu2 Laves phase is thermodynamically stable in the phase diagram of
a binary mixture of hard tetramers and hard spheres.

However,
it is important to remark here that besides the thermodynamic
stability of the Laves phase as investigated here, kinetics also plays
an important role in the self-assembly of the Laves phase. For instance,
the self-assembly of the Laves phase can be hampered by kinetic limitations
such as vitrification, kinetic trapping in metastable states, or slow
dynamics. In addition, the kinetic pathways for crystallization may
be influenced by hydrodynamics or changes in the interaction potentials.
For instance, it has been recently shown that DNA coating facilitates
the crystallization of the Laves phases.24 The crystallization kinetics and the different pathways for nucleation
will be left for future studies. With an outlook on the experimental
feasibility, we also surmise that the polydispersity in the tetramer
beads and in the tetramer overall aspect ratio would play a role in
the self-assembly process. Additionally, while the chosen size ratio
maximizes the volume fraction of the Laves phase at close-packing,
other size ratios could be investigated that lower the nucleation
barrier of the Laves phase. Studying the effect of colloidal epitaxy
on this system would be another interesting research direction.

Methods
In order to map out the
phase diagram of the system, we combine
Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric–isothermal ensemble
and free-energy calculations. Hence, the relevant thermodynamic quantities
are Ns, Nt, P, and T. The pressure P is measured in reduced units as βPσL3 where
β = 1/kBT, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the system temperature. The packing fraction is defined
as η = γρ, where ρ = N/V is the number density, V is the volume
of the simulation box, and γ = πσL3[x + 4q3(1 – x)]/6. To evolve
the system, we use displacement moves for spheres and tetramers, rotational
moves for tetramers, and volume moves. For each move, we set an acceptance
rate of 30%. An MC step (MCS) is defined as N attempted
translations or rotations and one volume move of the simulation box.
The length of the simulations in the isobaric–isothermal ensemble
is at least 5 × 106 MCS, while the free-energy calculations
run for at least 2 × 106 MCS. For the case of noncubic
crystal structures, we also employ NPT simulations where the box lattice
vectors are free to fluctuate, in order to remove any additional stress
from the crystal phase.30,31 For each composition
of large spheres x, the equation of state is computed
by means of compression and expansion runs. For the compression runs,
the starting configuration is a disordered fluid of Ns = xN spheres and Nt = (1 – x)N tetramers.
For the expansion runs, crystalline structures of selected composition
provide the initial configuration as explained in the main text. The
details on the free-energy calculations can be found in the SI.
