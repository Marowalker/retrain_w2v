Embedding
a magnetic electroactive molecule in a three-terminal
junction allows for the fast and local electric field control of magnetic
properties desirable in spintronic devices and quantum gates. Here,
we provide an example of this control through the reversible and stable
charging of a single all-organic neutral diradical molecule. By means
of inelastic electron tunnel spectroscopy we show that the added electron
occupies a molecular orbital distinct from those containing the two
radical electrons, forming a spin system with three antiferromagnetically
coupled spins. Changing the redox state of the molecule therefore
switches on and off a parallel exchange path between the two radical
spins through the added electron. This electrically controlled gating
of the intramolecular magnetic interactions constitutes an essential
ingredient of a single-molecule  quantum
gate.

==== Body
Fast, reversible,
and local
control of magnetic properties of molecular systems is sought after
as a potential path for molecule-based spintronic devices1−3 and quantum information processing.4−6 The control of the intramolecular
exchange coupling could allow, for instance, for the realization of
a single-molecule quantum gate.7−10 One way to achieve such control at the single-molecule
level is to embed a magnetic electroactive molecule in a solid-state
junction and use the gate electrode to change its magnetic properties
through a form of spin-electric coupling.7,11−17 Traditional candidates are single-molecule magnets (SMMs), the magnetic
parameters of which can be modulated with the addition of a charge18−20 or through magnetoelectric effects.21

A promising alternative to SMMs is offered by all-organic
radical
molecules,7 where the magnetism arises
from the unpaired spins of carbon atoms.22,23 The simplicity of their spin structure and the absence of metal
centers have proven to yield robust molecular junctions24−26 and potentially allow overcoming the limitations inherent to SMMs
owing to low spin–orbit coupling and hyperfine interaction.
However, the existing experimental examples have shown either a relatively
small electric control over the exchange coupling26 or a reduction of the molecule to a closed-shell system
with no unpaired spins.27

Here, we
report the reversible and stable reduction of a neutral
diradical molecule in a three-terminal device, by means of a gate
electrode. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) in the
two stable redox states shows that the added electron magnetically
couples to the two radical spins, preserving their open-shell character,
while changing the magnetic state of the molecule from a singlet to
a doublet state with three unpaired electrons. This ability to reversibly
switch on the exchange couplings between the added electron and the
two radical spins could form the base for a  quantum gate.7,28,29

Results and Discussion
The molecule we use is a neutral
2,4,6-hexakis(pentachlorophenyl)mesitylene
diradical molecule,30 hereafter PTM-based
diradical, schematically shown in Figure 1. It is made of three methyl carbon atoms
connected via a central benzene ring. Two of these
C atoms are methyl radicals with unpaired electrons, while the third
binds a H that closes the electronic shell. The resulting molecule
is a two-spin magnetic system. Two chlorinated phenyl rings attach
and surround each methyl carbon in a propeller-like configuration,
as seen in Figure 1. The single-molecule junction is formed when a single PTM-based
diradical bridges the source and drain electrodes as illustrated in Figure 1a. The electric field
produced by applying a gate voltage (Vg) to the third electrode is used to change the redox state of the
molecule (Figure 1b).
In transitioning between the two states, a high-conductance peak is
traversed. On the right (left) of the peak, i.e., at Vg,on (Vg,off), the redox center has a stable spin s = 1/2 (s = 0). Additional details on the fabrication
and molecule deposition can be found elsewhere31,32 and in the Methods.

the neutral diradical and reduced form of the diradical. The red dots
and the dashed lines mark the radical spins and the exchange interactions,
respectively. A gate voltage allows reversibly adding a spin (blue
dot) onto the redox center and, with that, switching on and off the
magnetic couplings between the added electron and the two radical
spins. For each state inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS)
is performed (yellow electron). (c) Differential conductance (red)
and corresponding redox center spin value s (blue)
as a function of Vg. Sweeping from Vg, off to Vg, on, the site is progressively filled and s increases
from 0 to 1/2. The value Vg, off (Vg, on) marks the gate voltage at which
the added spin stably resides off (on) the molecule.

We probe the excitation spectrum of an individual
diradical molecule
by measuring the dc current I through the junction
as a function of bias voltage V and extracting the
differential conductance dI/dV.
Each step in the dI/dV spectrum
signals the opening of an inelastic electron current channel via the excited state of the molecule with energy eV. Following the steps’ energy as a function of
magnetic field allows reading out the molecule’s energy spectrum,
providing a single-molecule analogue of electron-spin resonance spectroscopy. Figure 2a shows the dI/dV spectra of a diradical junction at
different magnetic fields B at fixed gate voltage Vg = −2.3 V. The spectrum taken at 0 T
shows symmetric steps at ±4.65 mV, which can be associated with
transitions to excited spin states. The confirmation of the magnetic
nature of the transitions is given by the evolution of the excitation
energies as a function of the applied magnetic field B (see Figure 2b, where
the second derivative, d2I/dV2, is shown for clarity). The excitation step splits into
three substeps as B is increased. As shown in the
level scheme of Figure 2d, this spectrum is consistent with the antiferromagnetically coupled
two-spin system depicted in Figure 2c with an open-shell singlet (S =
0) ground state |S⟩ and a triplet (S = 1) excited state |T⟩.

We compare the experimental spectra with numerical simulations
based on the tunneling model of ref (33) commonly used in scanning tunneling spectroscopy.
The dashed black lines in Figure 2a show the results of these simulations. Within the
framework of the model, we describe the diradical molecule by a model
Hamiltonian with two spin-1/2 centers interacting through a Heisenberg
exchange coupling J12. For all magnetic
field values, the data can be well fitted to this model with J12 = 4.65 meV. The preference for the singlet
ground state is ascribed to the distortion of the molecule in the
solid-state device in analogy with previous studies on PTM-based neutral
triradicals.26 We have verified the plausibility
of this scenario by DFT calculations (see Supporting Information Section 2.2 for details).

A similar measurement
is conducted at fixed Vg = 3 V. Figure 3a shows the resulting
dI/dV spectra
for two different magnetic fields. At B = 0 T, excitation
steps appear at V = −22, −19, +20,
and +25 mV, together with a zero-bias peak ascribable to the Kondo
effect.34,35 The asymmetry in bias-voltage positions
with respect to V = 0 and the different step heights
can be respectively explained by a bias-dependent tuning of the exchange
coupling and contributions from resonant transport with asymmetrically
coupled electrodes. For increasing B, the zero-bias
peak evolves into a dip and the excitation steps split into two (Figure 3a, inset) and three
for the low- and high-energy value, respectively. The d2I/dV2 color map of Figure 3b shows this magnetic
field evolution. From this set of excitations we deduce that the magnetic
spectrum consists of a doublet ground-state multiplet |D–⟩, giving rise to the observed Kondo peak,
a doublet excited multiplet |D+⟩,
and a quartet excited multiplet |Q⟩, as shown
in Figure 3d (see Supporting Information Section 1 for more details).
The excitations at +20 and +25 mV correspond therefore to the transitions
|D–⟩ → |D+⟩ and |D–⟩
→ |Q⟩, respectively.

The added electron, highlighted in blue, introduces two new exchange
couplings, J13 and J23, with the intrinsic radical spins. (d) Spin spectra and
allowed transitions for a three-spin system with antiferromagnetic J12.

The spectrum we obtain at this gate voltage can be hosted
only
by a system like the one depicted in Figure 3c, where the electrostatically added electron
occupies an empty orbital rather than either of the half-filled radical
orbitals and couples to the two unpaired spins via the exchange interactions J13 and J23. This type of charging, observed also in
two other molecular junctions of the 13 measured (see Methods for details on statistics), is in contrast to previously
reported experiments on PTM monoradicals27 and other neutral diradical molecules.36 One of the possible explanations, explored by DFT calculations (see Supporting Information Section 2.3), is that
the structural distortions determining the preference for the singlet
ground state lead also to a concomitant reduction of the HOMO–LUMO
gap.

Differently from the neutral state, the excitation spectrum
of
the reduced state does not provide a unique solution for J12, J13, and J23, but rather a subset of solutions in the space of the
three exchange couplings (see Supporting Information Section 1). One scenario, obtained assuming that the coupling between
the radical centers remains unchanged upon charging, yields for J13 and J23 the values
2 and 23 meV. In this scenario, the asymmetry between J13 and J23 suggests that the
added spin resides in the proximity of one of the radical centers.
Gas-phase DFT calculations indicate that the added electron may be
delocalized over the central phenyl ring (see Section 2.4 in the Supporting Information).

The transport
characteristics of Figure 2 and Figure 3 are connected, as can be seen when varying the gate
voltage Vg in a continuous way. Figure 4a shows a dI/dV map as a function of V and Vg. The high-conductance slanted
edges crossing into a zero-bias peak at Vg ≈ 0 V define a resonant electron transport region separating
two areas of low conductance. These features signal the presence of
a single molecule in the junction whose stable charge states, labeled
by Q = 0 and Q = −1, differ
by one electron. The two lines in Q = 0, marked by
vertical arrows, correspond to the singlet-to-triplet excitation steps
of Figure 2, while
the arrows on the right-hand side indicate the excitations discussed
in Figure 3.

Figure 4 Exchange-coupling
gating mechanism. (a) Differential conductance
(dI/dV) as a function of V and Vg at B = 0 T. Slanted high-conductance edges indicate resonant transport
and separate two distinct, low-conductance regions where the charge
state of the molecule is stable: a neutral charge state (Q = 0, left) and a reduced charge state (Q = −1,
right). Excitations lines at ±4.65 mV (vertical arrows) are present
in the Q = 0 state. In the Q = −1
state excitation lines appear at −19, −22, +20, and
+25 mV (horizontal arrows), along with a zero-bias line of enhanced
dI/dV.

The gate electrode thus provides a path to reversibly switch
between
the neutral and the reduced state of the diradical molecule. Along
a horizontal path around zero bias, the high-conductance peak of width
Γ ≈ 5 meV is traversed. In the proximity of the peak,
the molecule is in a fully mixed-valence state: electrons from the
electrodes are hopping on and off the redox center on a time scale
τ = ℏ/Γ ≈ 0.1 ps. Upon application of a
gate voltage Vg = +3 V (Vg = −3 V), within a time τ the redox center
acquires a discrete occupation number and a stable spin s = 1/2 (s = 0). The presence of the spin on the
redox center turns on two of the three magnetic couplings, J13 and J23, which,
in turn, influence the time evolution of the two-spin system. This
fast, electrically controlled switching of the intramolecular magnetic
interactions constitutes the essential ingredient of the quantum  gate
detailed in refs (9), (10), and (28), where two alternative
read-out mechanisms are also proposed.

Conclusions
In
summary, we show that incorporating an organic neutral diradical
molecule in a three-terminal device allows for reversible and stable
charging from the neutral state to its reduced state by means of a
gate voltage. By performing IETS on both redox states, we find that
the electron added onto the redox center magnetically couples to the
radical spins, thereby driving the two-spin singlet into a three-spin
doublet ground state (with three exchange couplings). In this way,
by controlling the occupation of the redox center, the exchange interactions
between the two radical spins and the added electron are switched
on and off. Due to the large coupling to the leads, this switching
takes place within subpicosecond time scales.

Methods
Details
on the Molecule
The studied molecule is a neutral
2,4,6-trichloro-α,α,α′,α′,α″,α″-hexakis(pentachlorophenyl)mesitylene
diradical prepared as previously reported.30 Electron spin resonance spectroscopy in frozen solutions containing
the molecules shows an S = 1 high-spin ground state,
indicative of ferromagnetic exchange interactions between the two
radical carbons in the molecule.

Junction Preparation
The molecular solution is prepared
in a water-free glovebox environment. A small amount of molecular
powder is dissolved in nitrogen-saturated dichlorobenzene to a concentration
of approximately 0.5 mM.

The molecular solution is deposited
by drop-casting onto a Si/SiO2 chip containing several
Au bridges 100 nm wide, 400 nm long, and 12 nm thick on top of a AuPd/Al2O3 gate. The nanometer-spaced source–drain
electrodes are produced by feedback-controlled electromigration of
these bridges.31 The electromigration process
is stopped when the bridge conductance reaches 3–4 G0. The wire is thereafter allowed to self-break
at room temperature.

A total of 160 junctions were measured,
13 of which showed signatures
characteristic of spin-dependent molecular transport. Eleven of these
13 showed clear singlet–triplet excitations with antiferromagnetic
coupling ranging from 0.1 to about 11 meV; one showed a triplet–singlet
characteristic with a ferromagnetic coupling of 2 meV. Four out of
the 11 exhibited a degeneracy point and thus charging within the available
gate voltage window. In three of the four, the added charge modulates
the magnetic properties.

Experimental Conditions
All the
measurements reported
here are performed in a high-vacuum chamber (P <
5 × 104 mbar) of a dilution refrigerator (∼70
mK). A built-in superconducting magnet can be used to apply magnetic
fields up to 9 T.

Electrical current I measurements
are performed applying a dc bias voltage V to the
source and drain gold electrodes and/or a dc gate voltage Vg while recording I. The differential
conductance dI/dV is obtained by
taking the numerical derivative of I.
