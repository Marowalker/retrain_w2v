We highlight the
importance of carrier–phonon coupling in
inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals. The low-temperature
photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of CsPbBr3 has been investigated
under a nonresonant and a nonstandard, quasi-resonant excitation scheme,
and phonon replicas of the main PL band have been identified as due
to the Fröhlich interaction. The energy of longitudinal optical
(LO) phonons has been determined from the separation of the zero phonon
band and phonon replicas. We reason that the observed LO phonon coupling
can only be related to an orthorhombically distorted crystal structure
of the perovskite nanocrystals. Additionally, the strength of carrier–phonon
coupling has been characterized using the ratio between the intensities
of the first phonon replica and the zero-phonon band. PL emission
from localized versus delocalized carriers has been
identified as the source of the observed discrepancies between the
LO phonon energy and phonon coupling strength under quasi-resonant
and nonresonant excitation conditions, respectively.

Carrier–phonon
scattering
is a topic of great importance for understanding the transport properties
of semiconductors, due to its impact on carrier mobilities. High mobilities
are desirable in applications that rely on the efficient separation
of electrons and holes, such as photovoltaics. Increased carrier mobilities
in solar cell devices are linked to the efficient diffusion of carriers
within the material.1−3 Similarly, light emitters benefit from increased
carrier mobilities, which ensure efficient carrier injection and transport,
and consequently high internal quantum efficiency for the devices.2 Additionally, the spectral width of light-emitting
semiconductor devices is strongly linked to carrier–phonon
interaction. As such, the importance of investigating the strength
of carrier–phonon interaction in a given material becomes immediately
clear.

In recent years, the scientific community has shown great
interest
in inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals,
for use in optoelectronic devices, due to their highly efficient light
emission and their highly tunable photoluminescence (PL) spectrum,
which can be varied across the entire visible range.4 Interest in the photovoltaic applications of lead halide
perovskites has led to extensive research on their transport properties,
albeit mostly for organic–inorganic hybrid materials. While
studies have proposed a number of mechanisms that could potentially
limit carrier mobilities,5−7 longitudinal optical (LO) phonon
scattering induces an intrinsic limit for room-temperature mobility
in polar materials.8 LO phonon coupling via the Fröhlich interaction has been inferred from
the temperature-dependent spectral broadening behavior of several
commonly studied hybrid lead halide perovskite materials.9 In 2D Ruddlesen–Popper perovskite thin
films, direct evidence of carrier–phonon coupling has recently
been observed in the form of anti-Stokes lines, through low-temperature
absorption and PL measurements.10 2D Ruddlesen–Popper
perovskites represent a rather distinct class of perovskite materials,
wherein the presence of long organic cations induces a crystal structure
similar to quantum well superlattices. Consequently, exciton binding
energies are significantly enhanced and effects such as carrier–phonon
interaction become increasingly significant. As such, enhanced carrier–phonon
interaction has been observed, involving different vibrational modes,
which have been attributed to both the inorganic lead halide cage
motion and rotations and bending of organic cations. Direct evidence
of non-Fröhlich carrier coupling to low-energy transverse optical
phonons has also been observed in the inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3.11,12

In this work we investigate the PL
spectra of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, under nonresonant and
quasi-resonant excitation. Quasi-resonant
conditions correspond to an excitation within the PL band of the nanocrystals,
toward the higher-energy side of the nonresonant PL profile. Similar
studies have been conducted for CdTe and CdSe colloidal nanocrystals,
in the form of resonant photoluminescence excitation experiments,
where LO phonon-assisted absorption led to size-selective excitation
within the inhomogeneously broadened samples.13,14 In this study we observed three evenly spaced luminescence bands
(see Figure 1), which
we attribute to carrier–phonon coupling via the Fröhlich interaction. The luminescence spectrum is fitted
as a sum of Voigt profiles. We provide a measure for the strength
of the Fröhlich interaction, by calculating the ratio between
the intensity of the first phonon band and that of the main emission
band.

(a) under nonresonant (405 nm) and (b) under quasi-resonant (520 nm)
excitation conditions. A narrowing of the PL band is observed at the
lower excitation energy. The laser line situated at the high-energy
end of the spectrum in (b) was blocked by the intermediate slit of
the spectrometer, such that the data points shown here do not span
the entire emission spectrum.

Results and Discussion
In polar semiconductors, an important
scattering mechanism is the
Fröhlich interaction, which represents the coupling to LO phonons via the Coulomb interaction between a carrier and the lattice.
While the Fröhlich interaction is typically more important
at higher temperatures, where kBT ≥ ℏωLO, such that the LO
phonon occupation number is high15 (ℏωLO represents the LO phonon energy), at low temperature (i.e., reduced phonon occupation numbers),
LO phonon coupling results in a specific PL line shape, consisting
of multiple, evenly spaced luminescence bands of varying intensity.
Low-temperature PL measurements allow us to quantify the Fröhlich
interaction within a material, which at higher temperatures would
be inaccessible, due to thermal contributions and acoustic line broadening.
The separation between the observed PL bands corresponds to the LO
phonon energy, such that the bands represent recombination events
with zero, one, two, or more participating phonons. Phonon coupling via the Fröhlich interaction at low temperatures
is due to the release of the polarization energy induced by the electrostatic
interaction between the polar lattice and the charge carrier. Upon
radiative recombination, the excess energy is released as polar lattice
vibrations (i.e., LO phonons), and
phonon side bands become visible in the PL spectrum of the material.
Evidently, neutral excitons must possess a built-in dipole moment
in order to interact significantly with the lattice, such that phonon
emission can occur. By investigating the PL spectrum of a given material,
we can visualize and measure the strength of carrier–phonon
interactions. This also has implications for general transport behavior
within the material, with consequences for both low- and room-temperature
conditions.

Colloidal nanocrystals of CsPbBr3 were
synthesized (as
described in the Methods section), yielding
average sizes ranging between 10 and 20 nm. For the measurements described
here, nanocrystal sizes were around 10 nm (Supporting
Information, Figure 1), whereas the reported exciton Bohr radius for CsPbBr3 is 7 nm.4 The processing of the
acquired PL spectra consisted of applying a median filter (see Supporting Information), in order to reduce noise
and remove artifacts such as cosmic rays, followed by a fitting procedure.
The fit function consisted of a sum of three evenly spaced Voigt profiles,
corresponding to the zero-phonon band and two phonon satellites, as
shown in Figure 1.
Phonon satellites were observed in the PL spectra taken under both
405 and 520 nm excitation. A reduction in the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the PL bands is observed under quasi-resonant excitation.
This is indicative of strong carrier localization, which leads to
inhomogeneous spectral broadening, due to local variations in localization
energy, related to the electronic environment of each individual carrier.
With increasing excitation energy, carriers can become delocalized,
occupying so-called “extended” states, which cover a
wide range of energies.16 Excitation closer
to the band edge results in the occupation of only a subset of states
(mostly localized), thus reducing the spectral width of the PL bands
(hereafter referred to as “PL bandwidth”). The point
in energy which separates the localized and delocalized states is
called the mobility edge. As such, the quasi-resonant line narrowing
is due to the positioning of the laser line within the nonresonant
PL spectrum, which results in reduced extended state luminescence.
Consequently, we also observe a red-shift of the main PL band under
quasi-resonant conditions, as compared to nonresonant excitation.
Similarly, Stoumpos etal. reported
bound state emission from bulk single crystals of CsPbBr3.17 Additionally, experimental and theoretical
reports have proposed different mechanisms for charge carrier binding
in lead halide perovskite materials, including bound excitons16 or self-trapping of electrons18 or holes19 through the formation
of small polarons. The dependence of PL energy on the chosen excitation
scheme is highlighted via the difference in PL band
maximum between the quasi-resonant and nonresonant spectra shown in Figure 1. The red-shift under
quasi-resonant conditions is on the order of 5 meV, which is within
the fwhm of the main PL band, suggesting that lower-energy states,
below the mobility edge, are predominantly excited. This occurs via transfer from extended states to localized states. The
positions of the satellites also exhibit a shift as the zero-phonon
band is shifted in accordance with the excitation conditions. This
enforces the idea of carrier–phonon coupling, as phonon replicas
in the luminescence spectrum of a material are always shifted by an
integer number of LO phonon energies with respect to the zero-phonon
band. Moreover, a temperature-dependent study of the PL bandwidth
is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure 2), as further
proof of LO phonon coupling.

(blue) and quasi-resonant
(green) excitation: (a, b) position of the highest-energy PL band;
(c) LO phonon energy; (d) coupling parameter S, obtained
from the ratio of the intensities of the second and first phonon replicas.
The data are normalized by probability, to account for the different
number of measurements in the quasi-resonant and nonresonant case.

The histograms in Figure 2 show the distribution of zero-phonon
band position, LO phonon
energy, and S parameter across a large number of
measurements. From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis
and the room-temperature PL spectrum (Supporting
Information, Figure 1) we conclude that the average nanocrystal size is close to
10 nm. This is confirmed by the currently available literature on
size-dependent PL energy.4,20 Each separate measurement
was taken at a different position on the sample, such that variations
in acquired values reflect the local nanocrystal dispersity. Additionally,
nanocrystals in close proximity to each other have been shown to exhibit
a modified band structure compared to isolated nanocrystals,20 and as such, fluctuations in the local nanocrystal
density can also lead to fluctuations in the PL energy. Alternatively,
shifts in emission energy may also arise from fluorescence blinking21 and from the crystal orientation of optically
active dipoles with respect to the detection axis.22Figure 2a and b show the position of the highest-energy PL band, while Figure 2c corresponds to
the LO phonon energies, and Figure 2d to the values of the S parameter.
Within the data set shown here, consisting of 100 measurements, 75
spectra were obtained under quasi-resonant conditions, and 25 under
nonresonant conditions, as quasi-resonant conditions produce a smaller
line width and improved signal. To account for this difference in
number of measurements, the data have been normalized according to
the occurrence probability of each value.

Under quasi-resonant
conditions, we determined a mean energy of
the main PL band of 2.365 eV, with a standard deviation of 1.7 meV,
whereas nonresonant excitation resulted in a mean energy of 2.366
meV, with a standard deviation of 2.6 meV. A detailed analysis of
the Lorentzian and Gaussian components of the Voigt profiles, which
reveals the different broadening mechanisms under the two excitation
conditions, is given in the Supporting Information. The average LO phonon energy under quasi-resonant excitation is
20.5 ± 0.6 meV, which is in line with previous reports.17,23 Under nonresonant excitation, we found a lower average LO phonon
energy of 17.9 ± 0.4 meV. Stoumpos etal. reported on the presence of a broad phonon mode in the
low-energy Raman spectrum of CsPbBr3 single crystals.17 The mode is situated at 165 cm–1 (20.4 meV), with an fwhm on the order of 75 cm–1 (9.3 meV), which is considerably larger than the difference between
the phonon energies corresponding to nonresonant and quasi-resonant
excitation schemes in our measurements. We identify the 165 cm–1 mode as an LO phonon mode, in accordance with the
value of the dielectric function and sample reflectivity at the corresponding
frequency. Similarly, a broad band was reported in the Raman spectrum
of the hybrid halide perovskite MAPbBr3 at 150 cm–1 (18.6 meV),24 along with a similar feature
for MAPbI3. We infer that the modes in question all represent
the same PbX6 octahedral mode, which is part of the lower-energy
range of the lead halide perovskite Raman spectrum.25−27 The emission
of different-energy phonons within the same broad mode can result
from recombination of carriers in localized and extended states. This
stems from the fact that the mean number of emitted phonons (i.e., the S parameter)
is dependent on the ratio between the qth Fourier
component of the charge density, ρq*, and the absolute value
of q:28,29 1  where . Consequently, the phonon emission probability
with wave vector q also depends on the localization
potential, and as such, any variation in the latter changes the q value for the emitted phonon, resulting in a different
energy. Additionally, the confinement of the carriers within the nanocrystals
leads to an extended range of inaccessible ρq* values around
the zone center, such that the high-q Fourier component
values and their spread become determining factors for the fq values for a given transition.
Evidently, the value of S also depends on the localizing
potential, and this can be seen in relation to the spread in Figure 2d. We observe a similar
mean value of the coupling parameter in both excitation conditions,
with S = 0.37 ± 0.11 under quasi-resonant excitation
and S = 0.38 ± 0.05 under nonresonant conditions.
The significantly smaller spread of the nonresonant S values reflects the prevalence of extended-state emission under
the respective excitation conditions, as opposed to bound-state emission
in the quasi-resonant case.

In order to highlight the occurrence
of carrier binding within
the nanocrystals and establish the corresponding mechanism, we refer
to the model introduced by Schmidt etal.,30 which describes the near-band-edge
emission from direct-band-gap semiconductors in terms of a power law
dependence between the PL intensity (I) and the excitation
power (Pexc): 2  In accordance with this
model, it is possible
to determine the dominant recombination mechanism within our system.
Thus, for above-band-gap excitation, a value of 1 < k < 2 corresponds to a predominantly free-exciton transition, while k < 1 values correspond to a situation where donor–acceptor
pair or free-to-bound carrier recombination dominates. If neither
free nor bound carrier recombination is dominant, the logarithmic
power dependence of PL intensity becomes curved, being impossible
to interpret in a straightforward manner. Under the quasi-resonant
scheme we excite mostly the lower-energy side of the PL spectrum,
which would correspond to excitation of mostly localized states. As
such, a value of k < 1 is expected. Conversely,
under nonresonant excitation, the resulting power dependence is influenced
by the ratio of localized-versus-delocalized luminescent
states, which contribute to PL, thus complicating the interpretation
of results. Our quasi-resonant excitation-power-dependent study of
the PL intensity of the perovskite nanocrystals, shown in Figure 3, revealed a saturation
of the PL intensity at higher powers, whereas in the low power range, k is indeed lower than 1. This is indicative of free-to-bound
carrier recombination, supporting our assumption that localized-state
luminescence occurs. The case of free-to-bound carrier recombination
would agree very well with the findings of both Neukirch etal.18 and Santomauro etal.,19 which
report on the self-trapping of one type of charge carrier due to polaronic
effects. Moreover, a recent report has revealed an electron Landé
factor, g ≃ 2, corresponding to free electrons,
while the value for holes was found to be much lower,12 corroborating the findings of Santomauro etal. It therefore seems plausible that the carrier
localization mechanism involves the reported small polarons formed
by holes.

Investigations regarding the change
in LO phonon energy under nonresonant
excitation, as compared to the quasi-resonant case, have raised an
interesting point of discussion, related to the crystal structure
of perovskite nanocrystals at low temperature. It is as of yet unclear
whether lead halide perovskite nanocrystals possess a stable cubic
crystal phase, and different views on the subject have been expressed.4,31,32 Nuclear site analysis of the
perovskite ABX3 structure has shown that zone-center LO
phonon modes can only exist in rotationally distorted perovskite polymorphs.33 In the ideal cubic structure, no such modes
are present within the first-order Raman spectrum, and as such, the
mere occurrence of the Fröhlich interaction strongly suggests
that the structure of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is not cubic,
but possesses a lower symmetry, as illustrated in Figure 4. Our results also agree with
the Raman spectrum presented by Stoumpos etal.,17 containing the previously
mentioned broad phonon mode. The crystal structure of the bulk single-crystal
samples used in their work is orthorhombic, such that we can assume
that the nanocrystals investigated here are of the same type. Furthermore,
it has been recently shown that the orthorhombic distortion of the
cubic perovskite lattice also plays an important role at room temperature,
resulting in the high PL quantum yields which are typically observed.22

Figure 4 (a) Ideal cubic unit cell of the CsPbBr3 perovskite
crystal lattice; (b) orthorhombic crystal structure of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, representing an octahedral distortion of the
ideal lattice, which consists of a twist of the relatively rigid PbBr6 cage; (c) rocking and (d) breathing phonon mode, of the orthorhombic
crystal phase, consisting of vibrations of the PbBr6 octahedra.

It is interesting to mention that
even in single nanocrystals secondary
PL bands have previously been observed. They have been attributed
to charging effects34 or biexciton emission,35 whereas our interpretation of the results corresponding
to nanocrystal ensembles can provide an alternative explanation. For
example, in the single-nanocrystal spectra shown by Rainò etal.,34 an
additional PL line is reported, appearing under higher-power excitation
and red-shifted by 10–20 meV with respect to the main line.
The splitting energy agrees very well with our findings, such that
carrier–phonon coupling is a plausible alternative for explaining
the additional luminescence band. Additionally, room-temperature broadening
in hybrid perovskite thin films has been explained via the Fröhlich mechanism in the work of Wright etal.9 However, phonon
side bands were not observed at cryogenic temperatures, as is the
case in our experiments. The justification for the apparent difference
in behavior stems in part from the different material structure (thin
films, in the case of Wright etal.), as well as a significant difference in phonon energy, combined
with a spectral broadening contribution. The latter two factors are
especially important, as the shape of the PL spectrum is strongly
dependent on the spectral width of the (phonon-assisted) transitions.36 Consequently, phonon replicas within the perovskite
PL spectrum can only be resolved if the LO phonon energy is sufficiently
large, such that the separation between the zero-phonon band and its
satellites can compensate for the bandwidth. It is thus immediately
clear that the study conducted here was made possible by the reduced
PL bandwidth, characteristic of perovskite nanocrystals.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have provided unambiguous evidence of carrier–phonon
coupling in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals via the
Fröhlich interaction. By fitting the nanocrystal PL spectrum,
we were able to determine the energy of the involved LO phonons. We
determine the ratio of one-phonon transitions to no-phonon transitions,
which provides a measure for the strength of carrier–phonon
interaction. It should be stressed that the occurrence of phonon coupling
described here for CsPbBr3 has implications for inorganic
as well as hybrid lead halide perovskites, due to the participation
of low-energy, octahedral phonon modes, which do not depend on the
nature of the cation.

The practical implications of this work
are considerable, in relation
to the main areas where lead halide perovskites have shown great potential,
specifically solar cell applications and light-emitting devices. In
relation to solar cell operation, a high rate of carrier–phonon
coupling typically leads to increased carrier scattering during transport.
Consequently, carrier mobilities are reduced, which could result in
an increased loss of carriers through nonradiative recombination.
We remark, however, that in metal halide perovskites carrier mobilities
up to the same order as silicon have been reported,17,37 which correlates very well with their outstanding performance as
solar cell materials. In regards to light-emitting applications, lead
halide perovskite nanocrystals have become increasingly popular, due
to high quantum efficiencies even at room temperature and their highly
tunable emission wavelength. For light-emitting diodes, reduced mobilities
due to strong coupling of carriers to optical phonons imply low device
efficiencies, as a consequence of reduced carrier injection and transport
efficiencies. Additionally, spectral broadening due to phonon coupling
has implications regarding the color purity of light emitters. At
low temperature, we have detected broad PL spectra of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which can be attributed to two main broadening
mechanisms. First, the bound nature of one of the carriers contributes
to inhomogeneous broadening of each luminescence band due to variations
in the local environment of each bound state. Second, the phonon-assisted
emission, consisting of several overlapping bands, further increases
the overall spectral width, in accordance with the number of phonon
replicas and the LO phonon energy. Altogether, the results presented
in this work provide a fundamental understanding of the properties
of CsPbBr3 as a material with potential commercial applications.

Methods
CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal
Synthesis and Materials Used
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, Sigma-Aldrich,
99.9%), 1-octadecene (ODE, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%), oleic acid (OA, Sigma-Aldrich,
90%), lead bromide (PbBr2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%), oleylamine
(OLAM, Sigma-Aldrich, 70%), anhydrous toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%),
anhydrous hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, 95%) were used. OLAM and OA were
degassed under reduced pressure at 120 °C for 1 h prior to use.
All other chemicals were used as received.

The CsPbBr3 NCs were prepared according to the method described by Protesescu etal.4 First,
a Cs-oleate precursor stock solution was prepared. Cs2CO3 (0.814 g), 2.5 mL of OA, and 40 mL of ODE were loaded into
a 100 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was dried under vacuum for
approximately 1 h at 120 °C and then heated under N2 to 150 °C until all Cs2CO3 had reacted
with OA. ODE (5 mL) and PbBr2 (0.069 g) were loaded into
a separate 25 mL flask and dried under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C.
OLAM (0.5 mL) and OA (0.5 mL) were injected at 120 °C under a
N2 atmosphere. After PbBr2 had dissolved, the
temperature was raised to 180 °C and 0.4 mL of the Cs-oleate
stock solution was quickly injected. We note that the Cs-oleate stock
solution had to be preheated to 100 °C before injection. After
five to ten seconds the reaction mixture was cooled by an ice–water
bath in order to quench the reaction.

Purification of the Nanocrystals
(NCs)
The CsPbBr3 NCs were purified following
the method described by De Roo etal.38 (for
a synthesis based on 69 mg of PbBr2). The crude synthesis
solution was centrifuged for 3 min at 10000 rpm, and the colored supernatant
was discarded. Then, 300 μL of hexane was added and the NCs
were dispersed using a vortex mixer. Subsequently, the suspension
was again centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 rpm, after which
the precipitate, containing larger NCs and agglomerates, was discarded.
Another 300 μL of hexane was added to the supernatant, resulting
in a colloidal dispersion of CsPbBr3 NCs.

Low-Temperature
PL Measurements
Samples for low-temperature
measurements were drop-cast on quartz substrates. The samples were
cooled to cryogenic temperatures (8 K). Acquisition of the PL spectra
was carried out using a diffraction-limited confocal microscope, coupled
into a single-mode optical fiber. For signal analysis a spectrometer
in triple-subtractive configuration, equipped with a silicon CCD detector,
was used. The samples were nonresonantly excited using a 405 nm diode
laser, while quasi-resonant excitation was achieved using a 520 nm
diode laser.
