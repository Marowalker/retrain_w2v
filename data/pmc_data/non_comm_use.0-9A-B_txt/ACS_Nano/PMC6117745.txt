The
knowledge of the quantum dot (QD) concentration in a colloidal
suspension and the quantitative understanding of the size-dependence
of the band gap of QDs are of crucial importance from both applied
and fundamental viewpoints. In this work, we investigate the size-dependence
of the optical properties of nearly spherical wurtzite (wz) CuInS2 (CIS) QDs in the 2.7 to 6.1 nm diameter range (polydispersity
≤10%). The QDs are synthesized by partial Cu+ for
In3+ cation exchange in template Cu2–xS nanocrystals, which yields CIS QDs with very small
composition variations (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11), regardless of their
sizes. These well-defined QDs are used to investigate the size-dependence
of the band gap of wz CIS QDs. A sizing curve is also constructed
for chalcopyrite CIS QDs by collecting and reanalyzing literature
data. We observe that both sizing curves follow primarily a 1/d dependence. Moreover, the molar absorption coefficients
and the absorption cross-section per CIS formula unit, both at 3.1
eV and at the band gap, are analyzed. The results demonstrate that
the molar absorption coefficients of CIS QDs follow a power law at
the first exciton transition energy (εE1 = 5208d2.45) and scale
with the QD volume at 3.1 eV. This latter observation implies that
the absorption cross-section per unit cell at 3.1 eV is size-independent
and therefore can be estimated from bulk optical constants. These
results also demonstrate that the molar absorption coefficients at
3.1 eV are more reliable for analytical purposes, since they are less
sensitive to size and shape dispersion.

Colloidal
semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) exhibit size-dependent optoelectronic properties, making
them promising materials for many applications, such as solution-processed
solar cells,1−3 luminescent solar concentrators,1 photodetectors,4 light-emitting
devices,1,5 optoelectronic devices,1,6 and
biomedical imaging.7−9 The successful development of these applications
requires a precise control over both the size and the concentration
of the QDs. Additionally, an accurate knowledge of the QD concentration
is also crucial for the synthesis of heteronanocrystals (e.g., core/shell QDs),10−12 preparation of QD superlattices,13−15 and fundamental
studies of the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles.16 This has made the determination of the molar
absorption coefficients ε of QDs an important endeavor, since
optical absorption spectroscopy offers a very fast and convenient
way to establish the concentration of colloidal suspensions of QDs.
Moreover, the absorption cross-section of QDs is a relevant parameter
for applications requiring the precise knowledge of the relationship
between excitation fluence and exciton density per QD (e.g., lasers). The quantitative understanding of the size-dependence
of the optical properties of QDs also allows the construction of empirical
sizing curves correlating the lowest energy absorption peak with the
QD size, which can in turn be used to verify the validity of theoretical
models describing quantum confinement effects and the nature of the
radiative recombination in semiconductor nanocrystals. Nevertheless,
the quantitative study of the size-dependence of the optical properties
of QDs has been to date primarily focused on binary compositions (Cd-,
Pb-, and Ag-chalcogenides,17−35 InP,36 and InAs37,38).

Ternary CuInS2 (CIS) QDs have attracted increasing
attention
due to their nontoxicity, large absorption coefficients across a broad
spectral range, and wide photoluminescence (PL) tunability through
the visible to the NIR spectral window.39−41 These QDs have been
applied in light-emitting devices,42−44 luminescent solar concentrators,45−48 and biolabels.49,50 However, despite the importance
of these nanomaterials, there are at present only two reports on the
size-dependence of the molar absorption coefficients of CIS QDs.51,52 Intriguingly, the size dependence of the ε values at the first
exciton transition energy (E1) reported
in these works is dramatically different: Qin etal.51 reported a power law with
an exponent of 2.1, while Booth etal.52 found a power law with an exponent
of 3.7. The latter work also reports that the ε values at higher
energy (3.1 eV) scale with the diameter to the power of 3.8,52 which is far stronger than the cubic size dependence
that is theoretically expected, and has been experimentally observed
in several binary chalcogenides.23,25,28,34,38 Although the reasons for these discrepancies are as yet unclear,
they may be attributed to the inherent difficulties associated with
the determination of sizes, absorption peak positions, and concentrations
of colloidal QDs. These experimental intricacies have in the past
been responsible for large inconsistencies between results reported
by different groups for the size-dependencies of the molar absorption
coefficients and band gap of binary QDs, such as the prototypical
CdSe.24,25,27,29,31−33 From this viewpoint, CIS QDs are even more challenging, since the
synthesis of ternary nanocrystals (NCs) with well-controlled size,
shape, and composition requires a strict balance between the reactivities
of three different precursors, to prevent the formation of binary
byproducts (e.g., Cu2S and In2S3, rather than CIS) or hetero-NCs
(e.g., Cu2S–CIS).40 Moreover, CIS QDs produced by direct synthesis
are typically trigonal-pyramidal in shape,52−55 further complicating the determination
of their sizes and introducing ambiguities, since “diameter”
becomes an ill-defined quantity, leading different authors to use
different metrics for the QD size (e.g., average
edge length,55 average diagonal length,52 Scherrer’s diameter determined from powder
X-ray diffraction51,56).

In this work, we circumvent
these difficulties by using topotactic
partial Cu+ for In3+ cation exchange to convert
template Cu2–xS NCs into nearly
spherical and stoichiometric (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11) wurtzite (wz)
CIS QDs ranging from 2.7 to 6.8 nm in diameter (size dispersion ≤10%),
which are ideally suited to investigate the size-dependence of the
band gap and of the molar absorption coefficients at both the first
exciton transition energy and far above the band gap (3.1 eV). We
also address the size-dependence of the band gap of chalcopyrite (cp)
CIS QDs by reanalyzing experimental data published by several groups.51,52,54−57 Our results demonstrate that
the molar absorption coefficients of wz CIS QDs follow a power law
with an exponent of 2.45 at first exciton transition energy and scale
with the QD volume at 3.1 eV.

Results and Discussion
Size-Controlled CIS QDs via Partial Cation
Exchange
Nearly spherical colloidal CIS QDs with small size
dispersion (≤10%) were synthesized by partial, self-limited
Cu+ for In3+ cation exchange (CE) in template
high-chalcocite Cu2–xS NCs, following
previously reported procedures (Figure 1a).58 The product CIS QDs
inherit the shape, size, and polydispersity of the template Cu2–xS NCs (Figure 1b,c). High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) (Figure 1c) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) [Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1] show that the product CIS QDs
have the wurtzite crystal structure, demonstrating that the hexagonal
sulfide sublattice of the template Cu2-xS NCs is preserved in the product NCs, in agreement with previous
reports.58,59 This protocol is highly versatile and can
be applied to obtain CIS QDs in the 2.7–6.8 nm diameter range
by using suitable template Cu2–xS NCs (SI, Table S1, Figure S2). The product
CIS QDs have a nearly spherical shape and exhibit good TEM contrast,
allowing the unambiguous determination of the QD diameters with good
accuracy (SI, Figure S2).

over 200 NCs and are fitted to a Gaussian distribution function.

Composition and Concentration
of the CIS QDs
The composition
of the product CIS QDs was determined by inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis and found to be nearly
stoichiometric (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11) in the 2.7–6.8 nm
size range (Figure 2a). For simplicity, these nearly stoichiometric Cu1.1In0.9S2 QDs will be hereafter referred to as “CIS”,
without explicit reference to their exact composition, unless the
composition is relevant to the point under discussion. To simplify
the calculation of the QD concentration, we approximate the In/Cu
molar ratio to 1 (see crystallographic model of a single wz CIS QD
in Figure 2b). Given
that Cu+ is taken as the reference, the CIS QD concentration
can be expressed as follows (see SI, method
1 for details): 1  nCu+ denotes the molar concentration of Cu+ measured by ICP-OES
analysis. VQD is the volume of a single
CIS QD, while Vuc represents the volume
of the wz CIS unit cell (Vuc = 84.99 Å3),60 and NCu+/uc is the number of Cu+ ions per unit cell (NCu+/uc = 1).60

molar ratios of wz CIS QDs obtained from 5.5 nm template Cu2–xS NCs. Ten parallel batches of cation exchange reactions
were performed by using different reaction times (20–200 min)
and In/Cu feeding ratios (1–5), while keeping all other parameters
constant (see SI, Table S2 for details).
(d) The first excitonic transition energies of the wz CIS QDs extracted

To test the reproducibility and robustness of the
synthesis protocol
used in our work, 10 different CE reactions were performed using the
same batch of 5.5 nm Cu2–xS NCs
as templates. The In/Cu feeding ratio was varied from 1 to 5, and
the reaction time increased from 20 to 200 min, while keeping all
other parameters constant (see SI, Table
S2 for details). Interestingly, the In/Cu ratios of the product CIS
QDs fluctuated only slightly (average 0.90 ± 0.09) (Figure 2c), regardless of
the In/Cu feeding ratio and reaction times. This shows that the Cu+ for In3+ CE in Cu2–xS NCs is self-limited under mild reaction conditions (≤130
°C), in agreement with the model proposed in ref (59), which attributes the
self-limitation to the high activation energies required to reorganize
the anionic sublattice from hexagonal close-packed in high-chalcocite
Cu2–xS and wz CIS to face-centered
cubic in In2S3.59 The partial and self-limited character of the Cu+ for
In3+ CE in Cu2–xS NCs
thus makes the synthesis method developed in our work quite robust
and reproducible.

The peak position of the lowest energy absorption
transition (E1) of these 10 CIS QD samples
was extracted
from the second derivative of their absorption spectra (Figure 2d and SI, Figure S3a) and found to be essentially the same (1.722 ±
0.003 eV), despite the slight composition fluctuations (In/Cu = 0.90
± 0.09). In contrast, the PL peak positions randomly fluctuate
from batch to batch (SI, Figures S3b and
S4), probably due to the low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs
≈ 1%) of the samples (SI, Figure
S5). This observation implies that the PL peak positions are unreliable
quantities to investigate the size dependence of the band gap of CIS
QDs. It should be noted that the PL spectra of CIS QD samples with
low PLQYs may not necessarily reflect the size, shape, and composition
polydispersity of the ensemble, as will be discussed in detail below.
The low PL QYs of the wz CIS QD samples investigated here are due
to the extensive washing required to ensure that the product QDs were
free of unreacted precursors, which resulted in a decrease of the
PLQYs of the as-prepared QDs by 1 order of magnitude, likely due to
defects induced by the excessive removal of surface ligands.

Size-Dependence
of the Optical Transitions of CIS QDs
The absorption and
PL spectra of the nearly stoichiometric wz CIS
QDs prepared in this work shift to lower energies with increasing
NC sizes (Figure 3 and SI, Figure S6), in agreement with previous reports
on both cp and wz CIS QDs.40,41,51,52,55−58,61 However, it is as yet unclear
whether the wide tunability of the optical properties of CIS NCs (and
other ternary copper chalcogenides) can be attributed solely to quantum
confinement effects, in striking contrast with the II–VI, IV–VI,
and III–V binary analogues.40 The
foremost difference between ternary copper (and silver) chalcogenides
(I–III–VI2) and binary II–VI and IV–VI
compounds is that the former can easily tolerate large deviations
from stoichiometry, both in the I/III ratio and VI/(I + III) ratio,
resulting in a rich defect chemistry.62−65 This has a dramatic impact on
the optical properties of ternary copper chalcogenides, because the
upper valence band in these materials is composed primarily of Cu
3d orbitals hybridized with the p orbitals of the chalcogen, while
the conduction band consists of Cu 4s orbitals with some mixing of
p character from the group VI element, which makes their band gap
composition-dependent.66 For example, band-gap
reductions of up to 190 meV have been reported for bulk CIS upon decreasing
the In/Cu ratio from 1.1 to 0.5, accompanied by the development of
a low-energy tail extending up to 200 meV below the band gap.62,63 The potential complications arising from a composition-dependent
band gap become particularly relevant at the nanoscale, since CIS
NCs are even more tolerant to off-stoichiometry than their bulk counterpart,
being readily made with In/Cu ratios ranging from 0.34 to 3.33,67 and also changing composition during the growth
process (e.g., In/Cu ratio from 0.58 to 1.09 in the
3.6 to 7.6 nm size range55). From this
perspective, the small composition and size distributions of the nearly
stoichiometric CIS QDs prepared in the present work (viz., In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11 and ≤10%, respectively) make them
ideally suited to investigate the size-dependence of the optical properties
of CIS QDs, without the confounding contribution of significant composition
fluctuations. It should also be noted that the size-dependent trends
observed in our work are likely also representative of fully stoichiometric
wz CuInS2 NCs, given that the deviation from stoichiometry
of the investigated CIS QDs is small. The nearly stoichiometric character
of the wz CIS QDs studied in the present work is also evidenced by
the absence of localized surface plasmon resonance bands, which are
typically associated with Cu-rich CIS NCs.40

However, as shown above, PL peak positions are
less reliable metrics
for the size dependence of the band gap of CIS QDs, since they vary
significantly even under roughly constant QD size and composition
(SI, Figure S4). Moreover, the PL quantum
yields of bare CIS QDs are generally low (≤10%),40,41,54,57,58,61 and therefore
the observed PL spectra may not necessarily reflect the size, shape,
and composition polydispersity of the ensemble. The inadequacy of
the PL peak positions for quantitative studies of the size-dependence
of the band gap is further aggravated by the fact that the PL in CIS
NCs (and other ternary Cu chalcogenides) is characterized by broad
bandwidths [full width at half-maximum (fwhm), ∼200–400
meV] and large global Stokes shifts (ΔST ≈
300–500 meV).40,41,68 For these reasons, the size-dependence of the band gap of CIS QDs
will be investigated here using only the peak position of the lowest
energy absorption transition, which is more accurate because the absorption
spectra are determined by the whole QD ensemble. This is however challenging,
as the absorption spectra of CIS NCs are essentially featureless and
do not show a sharp first absorption transition, even for QD ensembles
with small size dispersion (≤10%), such as those prepared in
the present work (Figure 3, SI, Figures S2 and S6). Nevertheless,
the first absorption transition energy (E1) can be reliably determined by locating the minimum of the second
derivative of the absorption spectrum (Figure 3). It should be noted that the absorption
spectra of colloidal QDs might be distorted by the presence of absorbing
impurities. Therefore, the evaluation of the CIS QD purity prior to
acquisition of the absorption spectra is essential (see Methods for details). As observed in Figure 3, the E1 values
are clearly size-dependent. This size-dependence will be quantitatively
addressed below, after we have discussed the spectral characteristics
of CIS QDs in more detail.

As mentioned above, the optical spectra
of CIS NCs are characterized
by broad features, in both absorption and PL.40,41,52,54,58,68 However, only the PL
fwhm’s have been quantitatively discussed in the literature,
probably because they can be readily obtained from the PL spectra.
In contrast, the fwhm of the lowest energy absorption transition can
only be extracted from the absorption spectra by fitting a Gaussian
distribution function centered at the peak position determined from
the second derivative of the spectra (SI, Figure S7). We performed this analysis for the wz CIS QDs prepared
in our work and found that the fwhm of the lowest energy absorption
transition varies from 180 to 320 meV, while that of the PL peak ranges
from ∼300 to 420 meV (SI, Figure
S8). For comparison, we also analyzed wz CIS QDs that had been investigated
in our previous work.58 These samples have
similar compositions to those investigated in the present work (viz., In/Cu = 0.7 ± 0.1), but present higher PLQYs
(22% to 3.4% in the 5.4 to 7.2 nm size range)58 and therefore yield more reliable PL fwhm values. It can be seen
that the fwhm values of these samples are comparable to those of the
wz CIS QDs prepared in the present work, except for the PL fwhm of
the QD samples with d ≥ 5 nm, which are significantly
larger for the presently investigated samples (viz., 420–380 and 320–300 meV, respectively, SI, Figure S8). This difference can be attributed
to the lower PLQYs of the samples investigated in the present work,
which result in PL spectra with higher signal-to-noise ratios and
therefore less reliable PL fwhm. Taken together, the data obtained
from both groups of samples suggest that the PL fwhm is essentially
size-independent (∼300–320 meV in the 2.7 to 7.2 nm
diameter range, neglecting the values obtained for the QDs prepared
in the present work with d ≥ 5 nm), while
that of the lowest energy absorption peak decreases with size from
∼300 to ∼200 meV in the 2.7 to 7.2 nm diameter range.
We have also determined the global Stokes shifts (ΔST) of the wz CIS QDs investigated in the present work and in our previous
work58 and established that they are size-independent
(viz., 455 ± 27 meV in the 2.7 to 7.2 nm size
range, SI, Figure S8). This is in contrast
with the weakly size-dependent ΔST values (viz., 470 to 350 meV in the 2.5 to 5.1 nm size range) previously
reported for cp CIS QDs.52 The discrepancy
is unlikely to be due to the different crystal structures (wz and
cp), since very similar ΔST values have been reported
for similarly sized cp CIS QDs (viz., 460 meV for
2.2 nm NCs,57 436 meV for 2.5 nm NCs54). The fwhm’s observed here for the PL
peaks are also comparable to those previously reported for cp CIS
NCs.40,41,52,54,68

The characteristics
of the PL of CIS NCs (viz.,
broad fwhm: 200–400 meV, large ΔST: ∼300–500
meV, and long radiative lifetimes τ: ∼200–400
ns)40,41,68 are strikingly
different from those of the 1Sh–1Se band-edge
PL of the prototypical II–VI NCs (e.g., fwhm:
150 to 80 meV,69,70 ΔST: ∼21
± 4 meV,69 and τ: 18–40
ns,25 for ensembles of CdSe QDs in the
2.6 to 8 nm size range with ≤10% size dispersion), indicating
that the radiative recombination mechanisms in these two classes of
materials are fundamentally dissimilar in nature. The origin of the
PL of CIS (and other ternary Cu and Ag chalcogenides) NCs has been
under intense debate40 and likely involves
the radiative recombination of a delocalized conduction band electron
with a localized hole.54,58,71−73 The hole localization after photoexcitation occurs
on subpicosecond time scales, probably on a Cu+ ion.54,73 We note that the larger variability of the PL peak positions of
CIS NCs with respect to the absorption transitions (see discussion
above and SI, Figure S4) is consistent
with this radiative recombination model and can be accounted for by
the inherently stochastic nature of the hole localization process.

However, the radiative recombination model presented above cannot
account for the broad bandwidths observed for the lowest energy absorption
transition of CIS QDs (∼200–300 meV, which is twice
as large as those observed for CdSe QDs69,70 and ∼4
times larger than those reported for PbSe QDs74), since the line widths of absorption transitions in semiconductor
QDs cannot be affected by the localization of the photogenerated hole.
A possible explanation can be found in a recent theoretical paper
by Efros and co-workers,75 which proposes
that the PL of spherical cp CIS NCs originates from the 1Sh–1Se exciton transition, similarly to the cases
of the binary II–VI, IV–VI, and III–V QDs. The
exciton radiative recombination in this model thus precludes the involvement
of localized carriers. The characteristics of the PL of CIS QDs are
attributed to the nature of the 1Sh–1Se exciton fine-structure states, of which the lowest emitting state
is nominally a dark exciton that hardly contributes to the absorption
and is separated by a large size-dependent energy gap from three upper
bright fine-structure states, which account for most of the absorption
oscillator strength.75 This model thus
explains both the large ΔST values and long radiative
lifetimes associated with the PL of CIS QDs and can also explain the
broad (and size-dependent) line widths of the lowest energy absorption
transition, as the energy separation between the highest and the lowest
energy bright states varies from 100 to 30 meV in the 2 to 3.6 nm
diameter range.75 Nevertheless, this model
also predicts a strongly size-dependent Stokes shift (viz., 300 to 100 meV in the 2 to 3.6 nm diameter range), in contrast
to the size-independent Stokes shift (viz., 455 ±
27 meV in the 2.7 to 7.2 nm size range) observed in the present work.
This model is also unable to explain the broad and (essentially) size-independent
PL fwhm displayed by CIS QDs, which suggests that the emitting state
is subject to a strong exciton–phonon coupling. We note that
a strong exciton–phonon coupling could also explain the broad
bandwidths of the lowest energy absorption transition of CIS QDs,
but this explanation lacks as yet experimental and theoretical support.
It is thus clear that the full understanding of the exciton transitions
in both cp and wz CIS QDs requires further experimental and theoretical
work.

Sizing Curves for wz and cp CIS QDs
To shed light on
the size-dependence of the band gap of CIS QDs, we constructed empirical
sizing curves for both wz and cp CIS QDs (Figure 4). The peak positions of the lowest energy
absorption transition (E1) of wz CIS QDs
were extracted from the second derivative of the absorption spectra
of the nearly stoichiometric (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11) CIS QDs prepared
in our work (Figure 3), while the QD diameters were determined from TEM images (SI, Figure S2). The data points for cp CIS QDs
were collected from previous reports51,52,54−57 and were mostly obtained from nearly stoichiometric
QDs, with In/Cu ratios of 1.0 ± 0.1 (see Supporting Information, Table S3, for the reported composition
of all the cp CIS QDs included in Figure 4b). The composition of the cp CIS QDs studied
by Zhong etal. were reported to
be size-dependent, changing from In/Cu = 0.42 to 0.88 in the 3.6 to
7.6 nm size range.55 A modest size-dependence
of the composition was also observed by Li etal. (In/Cu = 1.04 to 0.93 in the 2.2 to 3.3 nm size range).57 It should be noted that the sizes and E1 values for cp CIS QDs were not all determined
in the same way. For instance, the effective QD diameter was taken
to be the edge length of the pyramidal NCs by Zhong etal.,55 while Booth etal.52 took
their height (i.e., the diagonal length of the 2D
TEM projections), and Qin etal.51 and Akdas etal.56 used the Scherrer’s diameter
determined from powder X-ray diffraction. The E1 values were also determined by using different methods (e.g., extrapolation of Tauc plots in ref (55), double-tangent method
in ref (51)). Nevertheless,
as we will show below the uncertainties and systematic errors associated
with individual reports, as well as the compositional variations between
CIS QD samples investigated in different studies, are averaged out
when the combined data set is analyzed as a whole.

The solid line is a fit based on a theoretical expression (eq 2) and is described by eq 3. (b) Sizing curve of colloidal
cp CIS QDs. The symbols represent experimental data collected from
previous reports.51,52,54−57 The In/Cu ratio of most samples is 1.0 ± 0.1 (see Supporting Information, Table S3, for the reported
composition of all samples). The composition of the CIS QDs studied
by Zhong etal.55 and Li etal.57 were reported to be size-dependent (In/Cu =
0.42 to 0.88 in the 3.6 to 7.6 nm size range55 and 1.04 to 0.93 in the 2.2 to 3.3 nm size range,57 respectively). The purple dashed line represents a calculation
based on a finite depth-well effective mass approximation model.55 The orange solid line is a fit based on a theoretical
expression (eq 2) and
is described by eq 4.
The green data points circled by the dashed ellipsoidal line are derived
from an empirical polynomial function reported by Booth etal. using their data52 and was not included in the fit (see text for further details).
For convenience, sizing curves correlating the QD diameter with the
wavelength of the first absorption peak are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S9).

To fit the empirical size-dependent trends shown
in Figure 4, we used
an expression previously
proposed by Allan and Delerue based on tight binding calculations:76 2  where Eg(d) and Eg(∞) are the
band gap (in eV) for a QD of diameter d (in nm) and
for bulk, respectively, and a, b, and c are constants. Equation 2 has been successfully used to fit the empirical
trends observed for PbSe,28,76 PbS,23 CdSe,25 and CdTe25 QDs. Fitting the experimental data for wz CIS
QDs (Figure 4a) to eq 2 yields (χ2 ≈ 0.9999): 3  

Interestingly, the Eg(∞) value
obtained from the fit (1.327) is very close to the bulk band gap of
wz CIS calculated by Tomić and co-workers using hybrid density
functional theory (DFT) (viz., 1.3 eV).77 Bulk wz CIS is metastable at room temperature,
and therefore experimental data on its band gap have only recently
become available, owing to the development of synthesis methods yielding
ensembles of large wz CIS nanoparticles.60,78 The reported band-gap values, however, still carry a significant
uncertainty and are spread over a wide range (viz., 1.10–1.23 eV in ref (60) and 1.42 eV for 20 nm NCs in ref (78)). Nevertheless, it is
clear that the band gap of wz CIS is smaller than that of cp CIS,
which explains why wz CIS QDs typically show PL at lower energies
than similarly sized cp CIS QDs.58,68 This is also
consistent with the expression obtained by fitting the experimental
data for cp CIS QDs (Figure 4b) to eq 2 (χ2 ≈ 0.9997): 4  which
yields a Eg(∞) value that agrees
very well with the band gap reported
for bulk cp CIS (viz., 1.535 eV at 300 K).79 We note that some data points (indicated by
the dashed ellipsoid in Figure 4b) were not included in the fit because they clearly deviated
from the general trend evidenced by the other data points. The excluded
data points were obtained from an empirical sizing curve reported
by Booth and co-workers,52 which was constructed
using PL peak positions. To make these E1 values comparable to the values extracted from absorption data,
we corrected them by using the size-dependent Stokes shifts reported
in the same work.52 The evident discrepancy
between this group of data points and the E1 values extracted directly from absorption spectra (including the
spectra reported by Booth and co-workers in ref (52)) clearly demonstrates
the inadequacy of PL peak positions as metrics for the band gap, as
discussed in detail above. A systematic error can also be identified
in the data reported by Qin etal.51 for cp CIS QDs with diameters equal
to or larger than 4 nm, probably due to the large uncertainties associated
with the determination of E1 by the double-tangent
method in absorption spectra with broad and indistinct peaks.

The fitting results (eqs 3 and 4) show that the increase in band
gap with the reduction of the CIS QD size is mainly determined by
the 1/d term, for both wz and cp QDs. The contribution
of the 1/d2 term only becomes relevant
for sufficiently small QDs. This is in striking contrast with the
size-dependence of the band gap reported for CdSe and CdTe QDs, which
is almost completely due to the 1/d2 term,25 but is analogous to that observed for PbSe and
PbS QDs, which also varies mainly with 1/d.23,28,76 The 1/d2 term is typically associated with the quantum confinement
contribution, since this is the dependence predicted based on the
effective mass approximation (EMA), while the 1/d dependence reflects the Coulomb interaction contribution.80 However, the contribution of the Coulomb interaction
decreases with increasing dielectric constant ε80 and should thus not be significant for CIS QDs (ε
= 10).81 Therefore, the dominance of the
1/d term can be interpreted as evidence that, similarly
to the Pb-chalcogenides, the energy dispersion is mostly linear around
the band gap, being parabolic only in a very small region near the
extrema (i.e., top of valence band and bottom of
conduction band).76 This implies that the
hole and electron effective masses should not be relevant quantities
to determine the extent of quantum confinement effects in CIS QDs.
However, it is clear that the size-dependence of the band gap of cp
CIS QDs is much stronger than that of wz CIS QDs (see Figure 4a and b and eqs 3 and 4).
A possible explanation for this difference can be found in the electron
and hole effective masses of the two materials, which are smaller
for cp CIS (viz., me =
0.153 m0, mh = 0.958 m0)77 than for wz CIS (viz., me = 0.173 m0, mh = 2.181 m0).77 Since the experimental effective masses for wz CIS are not yet known,
we compared theoretical values calculated by hybrid DFT for both wz
and cp CIS.77 However, it should be pointed
out that the calculated values for cp CIS are slightly different from
the experimental ones (viz., me = 0.16 m0, mh = 1.3 m0).55

We note that a model based on the EMA (viz., the
finite depth-well EMA)82 has been successfully
used by Zhong and co-workers55 to describe
the empirical size-dependence observed in their work for cp CIS QDs
(3.6 to 7.3 nm; see dashed line in Figure 4b, parameters used: me= 0.16 m0, mh = 1.3 m0; Eg(bulk) = 1.53 eV; Eg(cap) = 7
eV). This modified EMA model takes into account the fact that the
confinement potential V0 is finite and
estimates it as being the difference between the HOMO–LUMO
energy gap of the capping ligands and the band gap of the semiconductor
(V0 = [Eg(cap) – Eg(bulk)]/2).82 However, Figure 4 clearly shows that the fit based on eq 2 (i.e., eq 4 above) is more accurate over the whole QD
size range analyzed than the calculations based on the modified EMA
(dashed line). The sizing curves reported in the present work (Figure 4 and eqs 3 and 4) thus
offer a convenient and accurate way of determining the sizes of both
wz and cp CIS QDs directly from absorption spectroscopy measurements.
For convenience, sizing curves directly correlating the QD diameter
with the wavelength of the first absorption peak are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S9).

Molar Absorption
Coefficient of wz CIS QDs at the First Exciton
Transition Energy
The molar absorption coefficients ε
of CIS QDs can be obtained using the Beer–Lambert law: 5  where A is the measured absorbance
at the lowest energy absorption transition E1 (i.e., the first exciton transition 1Sh–1Se), c denotes the molar
concentration of CIS QDs, and l is the optical path
length. The concentration of CIS QDs is obtained as discussed above
(see also SI, method 1, for details). The
peak positions E1 were extracted from
the second derivative of the absorption spectra as described above.
The size-dependent molar absorption coefficients at the first exciton
transition energy (εE1 in 105 M–1·cm–1) of CIS QDs can thus be readily obtained (Figure 5a). We observed that CIS QDs larger than
6.1 nm tend to lose their colloidal stability after extensive purification,
which results in the formation of aggregates that introduce light-scattering
contributions to the measured absorption spectra. This issue affects
the accuracy of the determination of absorption coefficients; thus
data concerning CIS QDs larger than 6.1 nm are not included in Figure 5.

Figure 5 (a) Size-dependent molar
absorption coefficients εE1 at the first exciton transition energy

a power law function (eq 6). Purple and green dashed lines denote the size-dependent trends

(c) Size-dependent molar absorption coefficients ε3.1 eV at 3.1 eV of wz CIS QDs (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11). The orange solid

the size-dependent trend reported in the literature for pyramidal
cp CIS QDs (In/Cu = 0.91) by Booth etal.52 (d) Size-dependent absorption cross-section
per formula unit at 3.1 eV (μ3.1 eV) of wz CIS
QDs (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11).

Similarly to previous work on binary InAs,37,38 Cd-chalcogenide,25,29,31−33 and Pb- chalcogenide QDs,23,26,28,30 the data in Figure 5a can be fitted to
a power law as follows (χ2 = 0.999): 6  

It is
evident that the size-dependence observed in our work is
significantly different from those reported by both Qin and co-workers
(viz., 11430d2.147)51 and Booth and co-workers (viz., (830 ± 660)d3.7±0.6).52 Moreover, the absolute εE1 values in both reports are overestimated with
respect to those presented here (in the case of Booth etal. only for d <4.5 nm). As
discussed above, these discrepancies likely originate from the inherent
experimental difficulties associated with the accurate determination
of the effective diameter of trigonal-pyramidal NCs (which may or
may not be truncated depending on the size), peak positions from broad
and indistinct absorption spectra, and concentrations of ternary QDs
that may have significant compositional polydispersity. The combined
effect of these uncertainties may be very large, especially considering
that the QD concentrations are affected by the uncertainties in both
their size and composition. Moreover, colloidal stability issues may
introduce additional errors due to light-scattering contributions,
which may go unnoticed given the typically featureless aspect of the
absorption spectra of CIS NCs.

The molar absorption coefficient
ε is related to the absorption
cross-section per QD σ by25,30,33,38 7  where NA is Avogadro’s
constant. The absorption cross-section per formula unit μ is
given by25 8  where Nunit/QD denotes the number of unit cells per QD. The number
of formula units
per unit cell (Z = 1) can be obtained from the crystal
lattice parameters of wz CIS QDs.60 As
shown in Figure 5b,
the absorption cross-section per formula unit at the first exciton
transition energy (μE1) of wz CIS QDs is size-dependent and can be described as (χ2 = 0.998): 9  

This
size-dependence strongly deviates from the theoretically expected
one, since a nearly size-independent oscillator strength per QD is
predicted for the first exciton transition 1Sh–1Se by several theoretical models (viz., k·p
EMA,80,83 tight-binding,84 and effective bond-orbital model85),
which implies that μE1 should follow a 1/d3 dependence. Nevertheless,
discrepancies between this theoretical prediction and empirical trends
are commonly observed. For example, a 1/d2 dependence has been reported for a number of colloidal QD systems
(CdSe QDs with d = 1.5–8 nm,25,33 CdTe QDs with d = 3.5–9 nm,25 PbSe QDs with d = 3–8 nm,28 and CdS QDs with d = 2.4–5.6
nm35). To date, a 1/d3 dependence has only been reported for CdTe QDs with d = 2–4 nm25,86 and CdS QDs with d = 1.3–2.4 nm.35 The
reasons for the divergence between the theoretical prediction and
the experimental observations remain as yet unclear. Furthermore,
it is important to note that the strong size-dependence of the absorption
coefficient of the lowest energy absorption transition of colloidal
QDs makes it less suitable as a tool to determine QD concentrations,
since its accuracy may be strongly compromised by the size and shape
polydispersity of the sample under consideration.

Molar Absorption
Coefficient of CIS QDs at Energies Far above
the Band-Edge
The molar absorption coefficient at higher
energy (3.1 eV) of the wz CIS QDs prepared in this work can be obtained
by 10  where A3.1 eV and AE1 are
the absorbances at 3.1 eV and at the first exciton transition energy,
respectively. The obtained data were plotted with respect to the CIS
QD diameter (d) (Figure 5c) and fitted to a power function yielding
(χ2 = 0.998) 11  

It is interesting to note that the
ε3.1 eV values scale with the volume of QDs,
showing that the spectral density of states is no longer significantly
affected by quantum confinement effects. This has been experimentally
observed for a number of colloidal QD systems (CdSe,24,25,33,87 CdTe,25 PbSe,28 InAs38) and is consistent with theoretical
predictions based on the EMA model.87 In
contrast, the size-dependence of ε3.1 eV reported
by Booth and co-workers for cp CIS QDs (viz., (2123
± 1090)d3.8±0.3)52 is far stronger than the theoretical expectation
and the previous experimental observations. The reasons for the inconsistency
between the present results and those previously reported in ref (52) are probably the same
as already discussed above for the size-dependence of the εE1 values. The absorption cross-section
per formula unit at 3.1 eV (μ3.1 eV) can be
determined by applying eq 8 above and is observed to be size-independent over the whole size
range investigated in our work (Figure 5d). These results confirm that ε3.1 eV scales with the volume of the CIS QDs and imply that ε3.1 eV is a more reliable parameter to accurately determine
the concentrations of colloidal suspensions of CIS QDs.

The
fact that the absorption cross-sections per unit cell at sufficiently
high energies above the band gap are size-independent implies that
they can be estimated from bulk optical constants. This is indeed
the case, as has been demonstrated for a number of materials (e.g., CdSe,25,87 InAs38). The absolute absorption cross-section per formula unit of both
wz and cp CIS QDs at 3.1 eV can then be calculated based on the Bruggeman
effective media theory,25,33,88 which can be written as 12  where ns and n are respectively the refractive
indices of the solvent
(1.5 for toluene) and the semiconductor at 3.1 eV (2.636 for wz CIS89 and 2.795 for cp CIS79). α3.1 eV is the absorption coefficient of
bulk CIS QDs at 3.1 eV (1.9 × 105 cm–1 for wz CIS and 2.55 × 105 cm–1 for cp CIS), which is calculated by90 13  where λ is the wavelength of light in
the vacuum. k denotes the extinction coefficient
of bulk CIS at 3.1 eV (0.605 for wz CIS89 and 0.813 for cp CIS79).

The term fLF in eq 12 is the local field correction factor, which
is given by25,33,88 14  m1 (m1 = n – ik) and m2 are the complex refractive indices of the
semiconductor and solvent, respectively. Since the absorption of toluene
at 3.1 eV is negligible, m2 can be replaced
by ns (viz., 1.5). The
absolute absorption cross-section per formula unit of wz and cp CIS
at 3.1 eV is thus calculated to be 9.7 × 10–18 and 1.18 × 10–17 cm2, respectively.
It should be noted that the bulk optical constants (n and k) used for wz CIS are theoretical values obtained
by DFT calculations,89 since experimental
data are available only for bulk cp CIS. Nevertheless, the calculated
μ3.1 eV value of wz CIS is very close to that
of cp CIS QDs, and they are both in good agreement with the value
experimentally determined in our work for wz CIS QDs [μ3.1 eV = (6.3 ± 0.4) × 10–18 cm2]. This demonstrates that the absorption cross-section
of CIS QDs at high energies can be indeed deduced from the bulk optical
constants.

Conclusions
We have reported here
a detailed study of the size-dependence of
the optical properties of colloidal wz CIS QDs in the 2.7 to 6.1 nm
diameter range, with emphasis on the energy of the first absorption
transition (1Se–1Sh) and its absorption
coefficient εE1 and on
the absorption coefficient at higher energy (3.1 eV). Nearly spherical
wz CIS QDs with small size dispersion (≤10%) are synthesized
by self-limited topotactic partial Cu+ for In3+ cation exchange in template Cu2–xS NCs. This synthesis protocol is robust and highly reproducible,
yielding nearly stoichiometric CIS QDs with very small composition
variations (In/Cu = 0.91 ± 0.11), regardless of their sizes.
The well-defined nearly spherical size and small composition and size
distributions of the CIS QDs prepared in the present work make them
ideally suited to this study. Our results show that the band gap of
wz CIS QDs increases with decreasing QD size, following a trend that
depends primarily on 1/d. A sizing curve is also
constructed for cp CIS QDs by collecting and reanalyzing data published
by several different groups.51,52,54−57 The size-dependence of the band gap of cp CIS QDs is observed to
be slightly stronger than that of wz CIS QDs, but also follows primarily
a 1/d dependence. These sizing curves provide a convenient
and accurate way of determining the sizes of both wz and cp CIS QDs
directly from absorption spectroscopy measurements. Moreover, we find
that the experimental size dependence of the molar absorption coefficient
εE1 of wz CIS QDs at
the first exciton transition energy can be accurately fit by the expression
εE1 = 5208d2.45. Interestingly, we observe that the absorption coefficients
of the wz CIS QDs at energies far above the band gap (i.e., 3.1 eV) scale directly with the QD volume, which implies that
the absorption cross-sections per unit cell are size-independent and
therefore can be estimated from bulk optical constants. Indeed, the
absolute absorption cross-sections per formula unit calculated from
the bulk optical constants of wz and cp CIS at 3.1 eV (viz., 9.7 × 10–18 and 1.18 × 10–17 cm2, respectively) are in good agreement with the value
experimentally determined in our work for wz CIS QDs [(6.3 ±
0.4) × 10–18 cm2]. These results
demonstrate that the absorption coefficients at 3.1 eV are better
suited to determine the concentrations of colloidal suspensions of
CIS QDs, since they are less sensitive to size and shape dispersion.

Methods
Materials
Copper(I)
acetate (CuAc, 97%), indium acetate
(In(Ac)3, 99.99%), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, ≥98%),
trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%),
1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), nitric acid (HNO3, 69.5%), anhydrous
toluene, methanol, and butanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Multi-Element calibration standard 3 and Multi-Element calibration
standard 5 (10 μg/mL of each element) were purchased from PerkinElmer.
TOPO and ODE were degassed at 120 °C under vacuum overnight prior
to synthesis. Other reagents were used as received. The chemicals
were weighed and handled inside a glovebox.

Synthesis of Cu2–xS NCs
Template Cu2–xS NCs were synthesized
in a standard Schlenk line according to previously reported procedures.58 CuAc (1 mmol, 0.126 g) and TOPO (4.65 mmol,
1.834 g) were mixed with 10 mL of predegassed ODE in a 100 mL three-neck
flask. The mixture was degassed at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, the
flask was purged by N2 and further heated to 210 °C.
At 160 °C, 2.5 mL of DDT were swiftly injected accompanied by
a sharp decrease of temperature to 147 °C. A change in solution
color from dark green to brown indicates the nucleation and growth
of Cu2–xS NCs. These NCs were allowed
to grow at 210 °C for 5–70 min, followed by naturally
cooling to room temperature. The crude reaction products were washed
using isometric butanol and methanol, followed by centrifugation at
3000 rpm for 10 min. The washing step was repeated twice to remove
residual precursors. Finally, the purified Cu2–xS NCs were dispersed into 5 mL of anhydrous toluene
and stored in a glovebox for further use.

Synthesis of CIS QDs
The wz CIS QDs were prepared following
previously published procedures.58 A 1
mL amount of purified Cu2–xS NCs
was degassed to remove toluene and was then redispersed into a solution
of DDT (0.5 mL) and ODE (1.5 mL). In the meantime, In(Ac)3 (0.2 mmol, 0.0584 g), TOP (0.2 mmol, 100 μL), and 2 mL of
ODE were mixed and degassed at 125 °C for 1 h. Subsequently,
the reaction flask containing the In–TOP complex (In/TOP =
1) solution was refilled with N2 and maintained at 125
°C. After that, the aforementioned Cu2–xS NCs solution was swiftly injected into the In–TOP
complex solution under N2. The mixture was kept at 125
°C for a variable amount of time depending on the size of template
Cu2–xS NCs (see SI, Table S1 for details). The mixture was vigorously stirred,
then naturally cooled to room temperature. The crude reaction mixture
was directly centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 1 min to isolate unreacted
precursors. The supernatant was collected and the product CIS QDs
were isolated and extensively washed (at least three times), using
the same purification procedure described above. Occasionally, the
solution became a gel after cooling or during the washing, requiring
the addition of a few drops of octylamine to redisperse the QDs and
proceed with the washing cycles. Finally, the CIS QDs were dispersed
into 4 mL of anhydrous toluene, well-sealed, and stored in a glovebox
for further use.

Assessment of the Sample Purity
Prior to the ICP-OES
analysis and absorption spectroscopy measurement, the purity of the
CIS QDs was assessed by XRD after different steps of purification.
Since the indium source in the CE reaction is In(Ac)3,
which is insoluble in nonpolar solvents, residual In(Ac)3 may still be present after the reaction. To remove In(Ac)3, the crude samples were directly centrifuged without adding any
antisolvents, followed by collecting suspended QDs in supernatant.
This step essentially removes unreacted In(Ac)3, as evidenced
by XRD measurements (SI, Figure S10). The
suspended QDs in the supernatant were subsequently washed, using the
same purification procedure described above, for at least three times
to ensure complete removal of In(Ac)3 and other byproducts.
After this purification step, the CIS QDs were dispersed into anhydrous
toluene and were stored in a glovebox.

Optical Spectroscopy
Prior to optical measurements,
the quartz cuvettes were immersed in 69.5% nitric acid for 5 min,
then thoroughly rinsed with Milli-Q water and absolute ethanol for
a final rinse, and dried by compressed air flow. This step is crucial
for reducing experimental error caused by contaminations from the
cuvettes. Samples for optical measurements were prepared by dispersing
CIS QDs into 3 mL of anhydrous toluene in precleaned sealable quartz
cuvettes under N2. To reduce inner filter effects, the
optical density at the lowest energy transition was below 0.1. Absorption
spectra were recorded on a double-beam PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/vis/NIR
spectrometer (175–3300 nm). PL spectra were acquired using
an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorometer equipped with a
450 W Xe lamp as excitation source and double-grating monochromators
for both the excitation and the emission. A Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier
tube (250–800 nm) and a liquid N2 cooled Hamamatsu
R5509-72 photomultiplier tube (750–1600 nm) were used as detectors
for obtaining PL spectra.

Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
The PLQYs were measured
using indocyanine green (ICG, PLQY = 12%) in DMSO as a standard.58,91 To avoid inner filter effects, the absorbances of the QD and ICG
solutions at and above the excitation wavelength (678 nm) were below
0.1.

X-ray Diffraction
XRD results were recorded on a Bruker
D2 Phaser, equipped with a Co Kα X-ray source (1.790 26
Å). Samples were washed at least three times, dried under vacuum
overnight, and uniformly dispersed on a silicon wafer prior to XRD
measurements.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Conventional
TEM images were acquired using a FEI Tecnai-20 microscope operating
at 200 kV. HRTEM was performed on a FEI Talos F200X microscope operating
at 200 kV. The lattice spacings of NCs were obtained by Fourier transform
from the area of interest in HRTEM images. Samples for TEM imaging
were prepared by drop-casting a toluene solution of purified NCs onto
a carbon-coated 200 mesh copper TEM grid.

Inductively Coupled Plasma
Optical Emission Spectroscopy
ICP measurements were performed
on a PerkinElmer Optima 8300 ICP-OES
spectrometer equipped with a high-performance segmented-array charge-coupled-device
detector. Samples were carefully dried under vacuum overnight and
then thoroughly dissolved in HNO3 (69.5%), yielding clean
yellow solutions. This solution was further diluted by 1000 times
to reach the ppm ranges required for the measurement. In the meantime,
Cu+ and In3+ calibration curves were prepared
using Multi-Element calibration standard 3 (10 μg/mL of each
element in 5% HNO3) with trace concentrations ranging from
0 to 1 ppm. S2– calibration curves were prepared
using Multi-Element calibration standard 5 (10 μg/mL of each
element in H2O with a trace of HF) with trace concentrations
ranging from 0 to 1 ppm. All the calibration curves were fitted to
lines with R-values larger than 0.999. The relative
standard deviation of Cu+ (324.752 nm) or In3+ (325.609 nm) concentration was less than 3%.
