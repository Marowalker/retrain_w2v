Copper–hydrides
are known catalysts for several technologically important reactions
such as hydrogenation of CO, hydroamination of alkenes and alkynes,
and chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones to unsaturated
alcohols. Stabilizing copper-based particles by ligand chemistry to
nanometer scale is an appealing route to make active catalysts with
optimized material economy; however, it has been long believed that
the ligand–metal interface, particularly if sulfur-containing
thiols are used as stabilizing agent, may poison the catalyst. We
report here a discovery of an ambient-stable thiolate-protected copper–hydride
nanocluster [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3– that readily catalyzes hydrogenation
of ketones to alcohols in mild conditions. A full experimental and
theoretical characterization of its atomic and electronic structure
shows that the 10 hydrides are instrumental for the stability of the
nanocluster and are in an active role being continuously consumed
and replenished in the hydrogenation reaction. Density functional
theory computations suggest, backed up by the experimental evidence,
that the hydrogenation takes place only around a single site of the
10 hydride locations, rendering the [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3– one of the
first nanocatalysts whose structure and catalytic functions are characterized
fully to atomic precision. Understanding of a working catalyst at
the atomistic level helps to optimize its properties and provides
fundamental insights into the controversial issue of how a stable,
ligand-passivated, metal-containing nanocluster can be at the same
time an active catalyst.

==== Body
Copper–hydride
complexes have been identified to be good catalysts for several diverse
organic reactions such as hydrogenation of CO, hydroamination of alkenes
and alkynes, and chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones
to unsaturated alcohols;1−3 an example of a fully characterized
copper–hydride complex is [CuH(PPh3)]6, which is commercially available as Stryker’s reagent.4,5 In recent times, however, there has been tremendous interest in
the use of metal nanoparticles as catalysts due to the unique electronic
and catalytic properties they possess in contrast to their bulk counterparts.6−8 In order to precisely control the stability, nuclearity, and uniform
composition of these catalysts, it is desired to synthesize them as
monolayer-protected clusters.9−12

In previous years, the composition, structure,
and electronic properties of several ligand-stabilized clusters have
been accurately and thoroughly investigated. In contrast to the increasing
number of gold and silver nanoclusters reported in the literature,12−21 studies on copper clusters remain relatively few.22−24 Reported Cu
nanoclusters include alkynyl-protected Cu53H18 and Cu20,25,26 dithiocarbamate-protected Cu28H15 and Cu13,27,28 dithiophosphate-protected Cu32H20 and Cu20H11,29,30 and phosphine-protected
Cu25H22 and Cu6H6.31,32 Protected clusters with 25 noble metal atoms and 18 thiolate ligands,
viz. [Au25(SR)18]− and [Ag25(SR)18]−, have been precisely
identified and studied in the past.21,33,34 In this paper, we report the synthesis, crystallographic
structure, and characterization of a thiolated copper nanocluster
comprising 25 Cu atoms with 18 thiolate ligands, however, embedded
with 10 hydride ions. In contrast to the Au25 and Ag25 clusters, which exist as monoanions,21,33,34 the Cu25 cluster exists as a
trianion, viz. [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3–, labeled as 1.

Although
sulfur (in thiolate ligands) has long been considered a poison for
catalysis, there have been many studies reporting the catalytic activity
of thiolate-stabilized clusters.29,35 A complete
atomistic picture for understanding the interaction between reactant
molecules and the highly stable, supposedly chemically passivated
clusters, however, has been lacking. Previous authors have suggested
the activation of ligand-stabilized Au clusters by the partial removal
of the protective thiolate layer, which can be achieved by suitable
thermal treatment,36 or, in the case of
supported clusters, the migration of ligands from the cluster to the
support.37 In this study, we demonstrate,
using a combination of experiments and first-principles calculations,
that cluster 1 performs as a catalyst for the hydrogenation
of ketones to corresponding alcohols at room temperature, even with
all ligands perfectly intact and gain an atomistic understanding of
the catalytic mechanism by a fully protected cluster.

Density
functional theory (DFT) calculations predict a single-site mechanism
and propose two possible energetically competing routes for the studied
reaction; most interestingly, subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) experiments
successfully confirm the single-site mechanism and the occurrence
of one of the proposed catalytic routes. We find that the H atoms
in the cluster exist as hydride ions and play a crucial role, not
only in stabilizing the geometry but also in the catalytic performance
of the cluster by active participation in the reaction mechanism.

A catalyst with a single reaction site is an ideal system for investigative
studies as it facilitates the opportunity to determine the catalytic
mechanism by means of experiments and calculations. This allows one
to gain important understanding on how ligand-stabilized clusters
perform as catalysts and can potentially help to offer a rational
strategic principle for the design of improved catalysts.

Results and Discussion
In contrast to previously reported discoveries of copper clusters,
where the syntheses were carried out under deoxygenated conditions,28,31,38,39 we carry out the synthesis of cluster 1 in air. In
brief, a yellow mixture of Cu(CH3COO)2, HSPhCl2, and PPh4BPh4 in CH2Cl2 is reduced by aqueous NaBH4 to form the Cu nanoclusters.
These clusters are then purified (by washing with a methanol solution)
and crystallized from a CH2Cl2/hexane mixture
at 4 °C, which leads to the growth of bright red crystals in
the solution after about 1 week (see detailed synthesis procedure
in the Methods section). The purified product
is used in all experiments to investigate the various properties of
the cluster. We have divided our results here into three subsections
to discuss the (i) structural properties, (ii) electronic and optical
properties of cluster 1, and (iii) the catalytic hydrogenation
of ketones to alcohols.

Structural Properties of [Cu25H10(SR)18]3–
To
examine the structure of cluster 1, we perform a single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis at 100 K (see Table S1 in Supporting Information for crystallographic data). This revealed
that each cluster consists of 25 Cu atoms and 18 thiolates and carries
a charge of −3, which is balanced by three PPh4+ counterions (see Figure 1a). In Figure 1b–d, we show the different atomic shells of the cluster
as obtained from a detailed analysis of the crystallographic data. Figure 1b shows the Cu@Cu12 core that exists as a centered twinned cuboctahedron (ctco).
Note the hexagonal close-packed configuration of Cu atoms in the ctco
core, which is different from the cuboctahedral building block in
the face-centered cubic structure of bulk Cu metal.28,30,40 We determine the average bond distance between
Cu atoms in the ctco core from both crystallographic data and the
optimized geometry obtained from our subsequent DFT calculations,
to be d(Cu–Cu) = 2.60 Å. We note that
this value is slightly larger than that found in bulk Cu (2.56 Å)
but is smaller than those reported for dithiocarbamate-protected Cu13 (2.64 Å) and phosphine-protected Cu25H22 (2.64 Å) clusters.28,31Figure 1c shows the next layer of metal
atoms that forms a truncated v3 tetrahedral (t3t) shell
in such a way that each distorted hexagonal face of the shell aligns
with a trigonal face of the ctco core. The Cu–Cu bond distances
within the shell and between atoms in the shell and core range from
2.46 to 3.11 Å. Figure 1d shows, in addition to the Cu atoms, the positions of the
S atoms of the thiolate ligands. The 18 edges of the t3t shell are
bridged by 18 thiolates; the shorter Cu–Cu edges (2.87 Å
< d(Cu–Cu) < 3.11 Å) are bridged
by two-coordinated (μ2) S atoms, whereas the longer
edges are bridged by three-coordinated (μ3) S atoms
that form a third bond with a Cu atom of the inner ctco core.40 It is interesting to note that the structure
of cluster 1 is very different from that of [Au25(SR)18]−1 and [Ag25(SR)18 ]−1, which have an icosahedral inner core
and M2(SR)3 motifs (M = Au, Ag).21,33,34

μ2 and μ3 S atoms. Color code: dark-red
and light-brown, Cu; gray, C; yellow, S; bright green, Cl; purple,
P. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity.

We also find that cluster 1 is intrinsically
chiral in nature; however, it crystallizes as a racemic pair in the
centrosymmetric space group P1̅ (see Figure S1). The molecule conforms to C3 point-group symmetry. The lowering of the
molecular symmetry from the idealized C3v to C3 is a result of
the twisting dispositions (either clockwise or counterclockwise) of
the thiolates about the idealized three-fold axis (see Figures S2 and S3). These twisting distortions
may be due to steric hindrance and van der Waals interactions between
the thiolate ligands (see Figure S4).

To investigate the presence of the 10 hydrogen atoms in the core
of the cluster, we synthesized a deuteride analogue of the cluster,
[Cu25D10(SPhCl2)18]3–, labeled as 1D, using sodium borodeuteride (NaBD4) as the reducing agent.
In Figure 2a, we show
the 2H NMR spectra of cluster 1 and deuterated
analogue 1D, in CD2Cl2, measured using an 850 MHz spectrometer. This allows
us to obtain signals only from D atoms in the sample. For cluster 1, we see only one peak that corresponds to the deuterated
solvent CD2Cl2, as the cluster itself contains
no D atoms. However, for deuterated cluster 1D, in addition to the signal from CD2Cl2, we see the appearance of four distinct peaks with intensity
ratios of 3:3:1:3. This strongly suggests the presence of 10 D atoms
in the cluster, in four different environments, that are disposed
in a three-fold symmetric arrangement, at least on the NMR time scale.

Figure 2 (a) 2H NMR of cluster 1 and deuterated cluster 1D in CD2Cl2; note the four distinct peaks in the latter (intensity ratios of
3:3:1:3), confirming the presence of 10 D (or H) atoms in four different
environments in the cluster. (b) Optimized geometry of the cluster
obtained from DFT (ligands not shown); simulated 1H NMR
results listed in the table help to assign the four peaks of NMR to
the four different D (or H) atoms, viz., Da, Db, Dc, and Dd shown in dark pink, pale pink,
green, and pale green, respectively. Cu atoms are shown in brown.

To further ascertain the presence
of the 10 hydrogen atoms in the cluster, we compare the 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 1D in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information. In both spectra, we obtain signals from H atoms in CH2Cl2, n-hexane, water, as well as H atoms
in the ligand layer; however, in the spectra of 1, we
see additional peaks that are completely missing in that of 1D. These peaks are due to the 10
H atoms in cluster 1 that are replaced by D atoms in 1D. Additional details and analysis
of the several peaks observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 1 are shown in Figures S6 and S7. The experimentally determined distances between Cu–H and
H–H are shown in Tables S2 and S3.

Based on a detailed analysis of the crystal structure of 1, the Cu–Cu bond distances in the ctco core (see Figure S8) and information from previously reported
structures of hydride-containing copper clusters,30,32,40,41 we propose
the positions of the 10 H (or D) atoms. These positions are validated
against the peaks obtained in the difference electron density map
of the crystallographic data followed by successful least-squares
refinements.23,42 Using the resolved crystal structure
data from X-ray diffraction and the proposed positions for H as a
starting point, we also carry out DFT calculations to further investigate
the structure and stability of the cluster. Upon geometric optimization,
we obtain a stable structure which is highly consistent with the experimentally
proposed structure, as shown in Figure 2b. We find that the Cu–Cu bond distances in
the optimized structure are in excellent agreement with those determined
experimentally (see Table S4).

We
also simulate 1H NMR shifts for the optimized structure
as listed in the table in Figure 2 (see details of the experiment in the Methods section). A clear difference can be seen in the calculated
shifts of μ3- and μ6-H atoms; μ3 peaks are observed in the upfield region (low ppm), whereas
μ6 peaks are observed in the low-field region (high
ppm) because of the differences in the shielding/deshielding conditions.
We find our simulated NMR shifts to be in qualitative agreement with
the spectra in Figure 2a, although the calculations overestimate the overall range of the
shifts (0.85–13.63 ppm compared to the experimentally observed
range of 0.85–7.39 ppm). This may be due to the missing effects
of solvent and dynamics, accuracy of determining the atomic charges,
and/or accuracy of describing the shielding/deshielding of nearby
Cu atoms in NMR calculations. Interestingly, in agreement with the
experimental NMR shifts, the calculations produce the same sequence
of intensity ratios of 3:3:1:3 correlated to the symmetrically unique
positions of the hydrides in the copper cage. Despite the overestimation
of the observed parts per million range, the calculated shifts prove
to be crucial for structural assignment; the observed NMR peaks are
assigned to H positions from downfield to upfield in the following
order: Ha (or Da), Hb (or Db), Hc (or Dc), and Hd (or Dd), as shown in Figure 2b.

The positions of the 10 hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms
in the cluster are shown in Figure 2b. Six hydrogen atoms, viz. three Ha (or
Da shown by dark pink spheres in the bottom half of the
cluster) and three Hb (or Db shown by pale pink
spheres in the top half of the cluster), are in six-fold-coordinated
μ6 geometries encapsulated in trigonal prismatic
(tp) cages formed by the squares of the ctco core and an edge of the
t3t shell. The remaining four hydrogen atoms have three-fold coordination
forming a triple bridge (or a cap) over a triangle of Cu atoms; one
Hc (or Dc shown by the green sphere) caps the
downward-facing Cu triangle in the ctco core, and three Hd (or Dd shown by pale green spheres) cap the three Cu
triangles on the top half of the ctco core. The 10 hydrogen atoms
together can also be described as a trigonal prism formed by six H
(Ha and Hb), with three H (Hd) capping
the three square faces of the prism while the last H (Hc) caps the bottom trigonal face. Based on the structure and positions
of the H atoms, it can be stipulated that the μ6-Hs
(Ha and Hb) are more interstitial in nature
and may be less accessible to any reactant molecules in the environment
than μ3-Hs (Hc and Hd). We
also note that Hc is in a symmetrically unique position
and lies along the C3 rotation axis of
the cluster.

To understand the importance of the H to the structure
of cluster 1, we perform calculations considering a H-free
species. We consider cluster 1, [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3–, and
another system with the H atoms removed, [Cu25(SPhCl2)18]3–. We heat cluster 1 and the H-free species within Langevin-type molecular dynamics
(MD) to a temperature of 300 K for 3.4 and 1.7 ps, respectively, by
calculating the interatomic forces from DFT. In the first case, for
cluster 1, the ctco symmetry and sites of the H in the
cluster are preserved during the entire simulation time, simply showing
thermal vibrations. However, we find that this treatment leads to
a complete collapse of the experimentally proposed cluster geometry
for the second case with the H-free species: (i) the symmetry of the
metal core transforms from a ctco to an icosahedral one and (ii) the
Cu–Cu bond lengths obtained after subsequent geometry optimization
deviate significantly from those determined from the crystallographic
data (see Table S4). This reveals the important
role that the hydrogen atoms play in stabilizing the structure of 1. Figure 3a,b gives a visual representation of the optimized geometries of 1 and the hydrogen-free species, respectively.

Figure 3 DFT-optimized structures
omitting ligands for (a) cluster 1 and (b) H-free species.
Structure in (a) was optimized directly from the experimental crystal
structure, and the one in (b) was optimized after a short MD simulation.
The Cu and S atoms are shown in brown and yellow, respectively, whereas
H atoms are shown in dark pink, pale pink, green, and pale green.
Note the loss of ctco symmetry brought about in (b) due to the removal
of H atoms from cluster 1, thereby indicating the role
of H in stabilizing the geometry of the cluster.

Electronic and Optical Properties of [Cu25H10(SR)18]3–
ESI-MS suggests that
cluster 1 is a trianionic species. We show in Figure 4a that we obtain
a distinct peak in the negative ionization mode at m/z 1601.17 that can be attributed to [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3– and that matches perfectly with the simulation for the molecular
formula (see Figure S10 for the spectra
at a larger scale). In addition, we see a peak in the positive ionization
mode corresponding to the countercation [PPh4]+. This confirms that cluster 1 has a negative charge
of −3 and is balanced by three countercations, [PPh4]+. It is interesting to note that this is again in contrast
to [Au25(SR)18]− and [Ag25(SR)18]−, both of which exist
as monoanions.21,33,34

Figure 4 (a)
ESI-MS measurements confirm the presence of 10 H atoms in the cluster
and that it has a negative charge of −3. It matches perfectly
with the simulation using the molecular formula [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3–. (b)
Comparison of the experimental UV–visible spectra and the simulated
optical spectra from DFT for cluster 1 with and without
H atoms.

In Figure S11, we show our results for ESI-MS measurements on deuterated
cluster 1D, where we obtain a
clear peak that corresponds to [Cu25D10(SPhCl2)18]3–, once again confirming
the presence of 10 D atoms in the cluster and the fact that the cluster
exists as a trianion.

Using DFT, we calculate the energy required
to take away an electron from cluster 1 to form the dianionic
cluster, [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]2–, to be 0.90 eV. This reinstates the finding
that the cluster is stable and prefers energetically to be in a charge
state of −3. By analyzing the topology of the charge density
distribution in the cluster obtained from our DFT calculations, we
extract charges on the different atoms using the Bader prescription,43 as listed in Table 1. We find that the Cu atoms are positively
charged; the charge on Cu increases going outward from the core to
the outer shell of Cu atoms (+0.13 to +0.28 to +0.42). All H atoms
are clearly negatively charged and can be described to exist as hydride
ions. Here again, we see that the Hc atom behaves slightly
different and is slightly more negatively charged than the rest of
the H atoms. Comparing the charges on the Cu atoms in the cluster,
with and without H atoms, we see that the Cu atoms are more positively
charged in the presence of H atoms.

In Figure S12, we show the density of
electronic states of cluster 1, as obtained from DFT,
which clearly shows that the cluster is nonmetallic in nature with
a large energy gap of 1.64 eV. A Ylm analysis of the states
further reveals the absence of any “superatom-like”
states of the delocalized metal electrons. 3D contour plots of the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) states are shown in Figure S13; these illustrate that the electrons bound to these states are mainly
confined in the metal core but are not centrosymmetric in nature.
It is interesting to note that for the H-free species [Cu25(SPhCl2)18]3–, the HOMO–LUMO
gap is found to be negligible; that is, the presence of the H– ions renders the cluster nonmetallic with a large
HOMO–LUMO gap stabilizing the electronic structure. We also
show in Figure S14 the cyclic voltammogram
and differential pulse voltammogram data for cluster 1 in CH2Cl2. This shows the presence of a large
electrochemical gap (about 2 eV), in accordance with the large HOMO–LUMO
gap calculated from DFT.

The experimental UV–visible
spectrum of cluster 1 in CH2Cl2, shown in Figure 4b, displays three distinguishable absorption bands at wavelengths
of 315, 430 and 520 nm. This is compared to the simulated optical
absorption spectra of cluster 1 (with 10 H) and the H-free
species [Cu25(SPhCl2)18]3–. As can be seen in Figure 4b, the computed spectrum of cluster 1 agrees
very well with the experimental spectrum showing three bands at wavelengths
of 350, 430, and 540 nm. However, the computed spectrum of the H-free
species shows only one major feature around the wavelength of 675
nm, which is clearly missing in the experimental data but is interestingly
similar in nature to the spectra observed for [Au25(SR)18]− and [Ag25(SR)18]−.21,33,34

Catalytic Hydrogenation of Ketones
One could naively believe
that, upon protection of the cluster with ligands, the cluster should
become highly stable and unreactive to any molecule in the vicinity.
However, contrary to this belief, we report that cluster 1, in the presence of the hydrides and all surface thiolate ligands,
behaves as an active catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones to
alcohols. It has been well-documented that copper-based hydrogenation
generally requires specific reagents such as alkalines and hydride
reductants or harsh reaction conditions such as high temperatures.44−48 Here, in contrast, we show that without introducing any reagents,
cluster 1 readily catalyzes at room temperature the hydrogenation
of 2-hexanone and 3-hexanone into their corresponding alcohols (see Figure 5). Note that the
cluster appears to be highly stable to be able to give a constant
reaction rate during the whole catalytic process (up to about 500
turnovers were tested in case of 3-hexanone).

Figure 5 Hydrogenation of 2-hexanone
and 3-hexanone catalyzed by cluster 1, with a turnover
frequency of 7.5 and 4.5 h–1, respectively. In 2-hexanone,
R1 and R2 are CH3(CH2)3– and CH3–, whereas in 3-hexanone,
R1 and R2 are CH3(CH2)2– and CH3CH2–. Reaction
conditions: 1 (1.0 μmol), hexanone (500 equiv)
in solvent (15 mL) under 40 bar H2 (see the Methods section for details).

To understand why cluster 1 behaves as a catalyst
even when fully protected by thiolate ligands and to investigate the
catalytic mechanism for the reaction, we resort to a combination of
DFT and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations.49 In order to reduce the computational cost, we chose to
study the catalytic hydrogenation of a model molecule, formaldehyde
(HCHO), which is the smallest molecule with a C=O carbonyl
bond. The thiolate ligand is also simplified from the experimental
−SPhCl2 to the model −SCHCl2.
We make the choice for the model ligand based on a few simple test
calculations on clusters with different ligands: −SPh, −SCHCl2, and −SCH3. We compare properties such
as HOMO–LUMO gap, charges on the different atoms, and energy
cost for removing an electron from the trianionic cluster to form
a dianion (see Figure S15). Although the
HOMO–LUMO gap and the charges on the Cu or H atoms do not change
significantly upon changing the ligand, we find that the presence
of the Cl atoms in the ligand is critical to stabilize the high −3
negative charge on the cluster. For the −SPh and −SCH3 ligands, we find that the dianionic cluster is more energetically
stable than the trianionic cluster. Therefore, for all further calculations
to study the reactivity of the cluster, we consider the cluster with
the model ligand SCHCl2, viz. [Cu25H10(SCHCl2)18]3–.

To begin,
we study the adsorption of the reactant molecules, H2 and
HCHO, on different possible sites of the cluster. We find that the
binding of molecular H2 to the cluster is highly unfavorable;
we obtain a few geometries with H2 adsorbed on different
Cu atoms; however, the binding energies of H2 suggest that
the process is highly endothermic and leads to a significant distortion
in the cluster geometry. We also find that HCHO does not adsorb on
the surface of the cluster as a molecule; however, it reacts with
the cluster by picking up a μ3-H atom and forms an
intermediate with an alkoxy group (−OCH3), viz.
[Cu25H9–OCH3(SR)18]3–. The C atom, which is sp2-hybridized
in the molecule HCHO, upon picking up the H from the cluster, now
becomes sp3-hybridized in the −OCH3 group.
Additionally, the O atom takes the place of the picked up μ3-H and binds to three Cu atoms on the cluster. We note that
because the μ6-H atoms are more interstitial in nature
than the μ3-H, they do not interact directly with
the incoming HCHO molecules. The four μ3-Hs (i.e., the Hc and three Hd) are more
accessible to the molecule to be picked up to form the species with
−OCH3, as shown in Figure 6a–d.

Figure 6 HCHO reacts with the [Cu25H10(SCHCl2)18]3– cluster
by picking up a μ3-H and forms an intermediate with
an alkoxy (−OCH3) group. In (a), HCHO interacts
with the Hc atom (green sphere) at the bottom of the cluster,
and in (b–d), HCHO interacts with the Hd atoms (pale
green spheres) in the top half of the cluster. The frame of the Cu
cluster is drawn in brown, and the hydrogen atoms Ha and
Hb are shown as dark pink and pale pink spheres, respectively.
The H, C, and O in HCHO are shown as light gray, dark gray, and red
spheres, respectively.

We define EbHCHO, the binding energy of HCHO to the cluster
as  where the three terms on
the right-hand side of the equation are, respectively, the energies
obtained from DFT of the intermediate with the alkoxy group, the gas
phase HCHO molecule, and the cluster [Cu25H10(SCHCl2)18]3–. The values
of EbHCHO obtained for the different μ3-H sites
are −0.77 eV for the reaction site with Hc shown
in Figure 6a and −0.34,
−0.43, and −0.25 eV for the reaction sites with Hd shown in Figure 6b–d, respectively. Based on these energetics, we suggest
that the reaction may proceed via a single-site mechanism
because the Hc reaction site is significantly most preferred
over the other sites. We determine the activation barrier, using NEB
calculations, for the formation of the intermediate at the Hc site to be 0.72 eV. The formation and stability of the intermediate
species with the alkoxy group also reveal that the hydride ions in
the cluster play an important role in the catalytic process by directly
interacting with the reactant molecule.

We propose that, once
the intermediate [Cu25H9–OCH3(SR)18]3– is formed, the reaction can
proceed via two possible routes: Route 1 and Route
2, as shown in Figure 7. In Route 1, we suggest that a molecular H2 dissociates
heterolytically into H+ and H–, close
to the Cu–O bond: H+ binds to O, forming the reaction
product, the alcohol, whereas the H– binds to the
three Cu atoms and takes the position at the Hc site in
the cluster. The barrier for this step is calculated to be 0.82 eV.
The heterolytic dissociation is evidenced by the Bader charges on
the H atoms of the activated H2 molecule [d(H–H) = 0.9 Å] in the transition state of the reaction
step: one H has a charge of +0.26e, whereas the other
has a charge of −0.30e. The alcohol formed
is weakly bound to the cluster via dipole–dipole
interactions between the −OH group in the alcohol and the ligands
in the cluster, with a binding strength of −0.22 eV with respect
to the isolated cluster and gas-phase alcohol molecule. Note that,
in Route 1, only one H (Hc) from the cluster participates
in the reaction and is finally replaced by the H from molecular H2, or as can be seen in the first panel of Figure 7, the green Hc atom
is replaced by a blue H atom from molecular H2 at the end
of the reaction.

Figure 7 Energy profiles of Route 1 and Route 2 for the catalytic
hydrogenation of HCHO by [Cu25H10(SCHCl2)18]3–. Though not explicitly
mentioned, note that all of the systems studied have 25 Cu atoms and
18 thiolate ligands. The color scheme for the atoms is the same as
that in Figure 6, and
H atoms in H2 are colored blue. The numbers in black are
the energies of the different states along the catalytic pathways,
relative to the sum of the total energies of the isolated cluster,
HCHO and H2 in gas phase, whereas the numbers in red are
the barrier heights for the forward reaction for individual steps.
The gas-phase species in every elementary step are shown in the green
and blue boxes for Routes 1 and 2, respectively.

In Route 2, we suggest that a second H from the cluster,
a neighboring μ6-H such as Ha (shown in
dark pink), may diffuse close to the O atom to form the reaction product
(the alcohol), leaving behind a cluster with two H vacancies, [Cu25H8(SR)18]3–. The
barrier for this process is determined to be 0.85 eV. The energy cost
to create the cluster with two H vacancies from the original cluster
can be calculated as E{[Cu25H8(SR)18]3–} + E{H2} – E{[Cu25H10(SR)18]3–} = +0.60 eV. The two vacancy
sites are then replenished by the dissociation of molecular H2 to complete the catalytic cycle; this step has a barrier
of 0.43 eV. Note that, in Route 2, two H atoms (Hc and
Ha) from the cluster participate in the reaction and are
finally replaced by two H atoms from molecular H2, or as
can be seen in the second panel of Figure 7, the green Hc atom and one dark
pink Ha atom are replaced by two blue H atoms from molecular
H2 at the end of the reaction.

Based on our DFT results,
we suggest that the Hc site on the cluster is the energetically
most preferred reaction site for the binding of molecules with a carbonyl
(C=O) group. The C in the C=O group picks up the Hc atom, whereas the O binds to the three Cu atoms and takes
the position of the missing Hc. Based on DFT and NEB results,
we propose two catalytic pathways that are thermodynamically possible.
The kinetics for the two pathways (i.e., the barrier
heights for the different steps along the pathways) seem to be comparable
and do not favor one over the other.

Further experiments were
carried out to explore the catalytic mechanism for the studied reaction
and, most importantly, to validate the predictions made by our DFT
calculations. In Figure 8, we show the 2H NMR spectra of deuterated cluster 1D in the presence of the reactant
molecule, 3-hexanone in CD2Cl2. Recall that
in Figure 2a the 2H NMR spectra of cluster 1D in CD2Cl2 showed, in addition to the
peak for CD2Cl2, four distinct peaks that correspond
to the four kinds of D atoms in the cluster, viz., Da,
Db, Dc, and Dd. In Figure 8, due to the presence of the
3-hexanone molecule, we see a clear split in the chemical shift in
the peak that corresponds to the hydride Dc. We believe
that this clearly suggests an interaction between the reactant molecule
and the Dc (or Hc) atom in the cluster; this
may be an indication toward a single-site mechanism with Dc (or Hc) as the most reactive site.

Figure 8 2H NMR of 1D with 3-hexanone in CH2Cl2. The interaction of the reactant molecule 3-hexanone
with the 1D cluster may be causing
a chemical shift in the NMR peak for Dc. This seems to
support our suggestion of a single-site mechanism for the catalytic
reaction.

To investigate and test the predicted
catalytic routes, we have carried out the hydrogenation reaction in
two modes: (i) 1D + hexanone
+ H2 and (ii) 1 + hexanone + D2. In the first case, deuterated cluster 1D behaves as the catalyst for the reaction between hexanone
and molecular H2. The ESI-MS spectrum of 1D after the catalytic reaction with H2 is shown in Figure 9a. The peak obtained at m/z 2575.63 in the negative ionization mode is found to match well with
the simulation for the molecular formula [Cu25D8H2(SPhCl2)18(PPh4)]2–. This tells us that (at least) two D atoms from 1D have been replaced by two H atoms;
that is, the result seems to promote catalytic Route 2. We also note
the slight asymmetry of the mass peak in Figure 9a; this may indicate that 2–4 D atoms
have been replaced by H as the clusters have undergone several reaction
cycles. In Figure 9b, we show the 2H NMR spectra of 1D after the catalytic reaction with H2. This
should be compared to Figure 9c (the 2H NMR spectra of 1D before catalysis), where we see, in addition to the
peak for CD2Cl2, four peaks in the ratio of
3:3:1:3. We see that, after the catalytic reaction, the peak corresponding
to Dc has completely disappeared, which suggests that (at
least) the Dc atom has definitely been replaced by a H
atom. This clearly validates our prediction for the single-site mechanism
with Dc being the most reactive site. Whether or not a
second D atom (Da) is missing in the cluster is difficult
to infer from this 2H NMR spectra.

Figure 9 Reaction of 1D with ketone and H2. (a) ESI-MS
spectrum of re-collected 1D after
the catalysis under H2 shows that two to four D atoms from
the cluster have been replaced by two H atoms {simulation is for [Cu25D8H2(SPhCl2)18(PPh4)]2–}, which suggests the occurrence
of Route 2 mechanism. (b) 2H NMR spectra of 1D after catalysis with H2 can
be compared with (c) spectra of 1D before catalysis to highlight the disappearance of the Dc peak in (b); this clearly confirms our suggestion for a single-site
mechanism. The Dc atom has definitely been replaced by
a hydrogen atom during the catalytic process.

We also carry out an experiment using cluster 1 as the catalyst for hydrogenation of hexanone with molecular D2. Note that the 2H NMR of cluster 1 in CD2Cl2 before catalysis (see Figure 2a) shows only one peak that
corresponds to CD2Cl2, as the cluster itself
contains no D atoms. However, the 2H NMR of the cluster
after catalysis with D2 in Figure 10a shows the appearance of two new peaks,
in addition to the expected two peaks from CD2Cl2 and molecular D2. These two new peaks may be due to the
replacement of two H atoms (in positions Hc and Ha) by D atoms in the cluster, although they do seem to be slightly
shifted to upfield with respect to the Da and Dc peaks in Figure 9c. The 2H NMR of the alcohol formed is shown in Figure 10b; it shows that
the product is deuterated with two D atoms. These results suggest
that the Route 2 catalytic mechanism may be the preferred pathway
for the reaction, as clearly two hydrogen atoms from the cluster are
replaced. The fact that the product is deuterated may be due to multiple
catalytic cycles performed by the same cluster; in the first cycle,
two H atoms are replaced by two D atoms, and in subsequent cycles,
the same two D atoms interact with the hexanone molecules to give
deuterated products, to be replenished again by D atoms from D2.

Figure 10 Reaction of 1 with ketone and D2. (a) 2H NMR of 1 after catalysis with D2 shows the appearance of two peaks that may be slightly right-shifted
but correspond to Dc and Da atoms in the cluster.
This confirms that two H atoms in the cluster have been replaced by
two D atoms from molecular D2, supporting the Route 2 catalytic
mechanism. (b) 2H NMR show that the alcohol product is
deuterated.

It seems to be clear
now, from our DFT calculations as well as experimental data, that
(i) the cluster [Cu25H10(SR)18]3– behaves as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of ketones
(or aldehydes) via a single-site mechanism with the
Hc site on the cluster being the most reactive site, and
(ii) the catalytic pathway proceeds via the mechanism
“Route 2” rather than “Route 1”. To understand
these findings, we analyze the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)
or free space around the 10 H atoms (or 10 pockets) in the cluster
[Cu25H10(SCHCl2)18]3–, using the Visual Molecular Dynamics software.50 By this method, one can measure the accessibility
or the ease with which an incoming reactant molecule can approach
and pick up a H from the cluster. In Figure 11a, we plot our results for the SASA values
around the 10 different H sites in the cluster as a function of the
radius of the probe spheres. At the onset, it is clear that, as expected,
the μ6-H (Ha and Hb) are barely
accessible, or the μ3-H (Hc and Hd) are more accessible than μ6-H. Interestingly,
we find that the Hc site is most accessible among the four
μ3-H. The Hc atom is accessible to molecules
with a maximum radius of 1.3 Å; however, the Hd atoms
are accessible only to molecules with a maximum radius of 0.6 Å;
this may be due to the unique position that the Hc atom
holds in the cluster geometry. This may explain why the catalytic
reaction proceeds via a single-site mechanism.

Figure 11 (a) SASA
analysis of the different H sites on the cluster [Cu25H10(SCHCl2)18]3– shows
that clearly μ3-H sites (Hc and Hd) are more accessible than μ6-H sites (Ha and Hb), and the Hc site is most accessible
among the μ3-H sites. This explains why the catalysis
proceeds via a single-site mechanism. (b) SASA analysis
of the Hc site after the formation of the intermediate
with the alkoxy group (−OCH3) suggests that the
site is no longer very accessible even for an incoming H2 molecule to allow the Route 1 mechanism. This explains why Route
2 may be the preferred catalytic mechanism.

In Figure 11b, we show the SASA values for the Hc pocket in the cluster
after the formation of the intermediate with the alkoxy (OCH3) group, as a function of the probe sphere radius. We now see that
the Hc pocket is no longer accessible for molecules with
a radius greater than 0.6 Å. Note that this analysis was carried
out using the cluster with model ligands and model reactant molecule
HCHO. In the real scenario, the presence of the experimental ligands
and the hexanoxy group may reduce the accessibility of the pocket
even further; that is, the site may no longer be accessible for a
H2 molecule to dissociate close to the Cu–O interface
to allow the Route 1 mechanism. This may be the reason why Route 2
is the preferred catalytic mechanism for the reaction.

Conclusions
In this work, we have synthesized and fully characterized an ambient-stable,
atomically precise, thiolated Cu25H10 nanocluster
by experimental and computational methods and showed that this cluster
is an active catalyst for hydrogenation of ketones to corresponding
alcohols in mild conditions. The 10 hydrogens found inside the copper
core are in hydride form and play a crucial role in stabilizing the
structure and acting as a hydrogen source in the catalytic reaction.
Density functional theory computations predict a single-site mechanism
that is confirmed by experimental data. Although the activity of the
Cu25H10 cluster is below that of a typical industrial
catalyst, this system offers important insight into understanding
catalytic reactions at the atomistic level and at the same time sheds
light on the controversial issue of how a ligand-protected metal cluster
can have a catalytic function.

Methods
Reagents
Copper(II) acetate monohydrate [Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, purity 99%], sodium borohydride (NaBH4, purity 98%), sodium borodeuteride (NaBD4, purity 99%),
dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, A.R.), and methanol
(CH3OH, A.R.) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Tetraphenylphosphonium tetraphenylborate
(TPPTPB, purity 99%), 2,4-dichlorobenzenethiol (HSPhCl2, purity 99%), 2-hexanone (purity 99%), and 3-hexanone (purity 99%)
were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Tianjin,
China). The water used in all experiments was ultrapure. All reagents
were used as received without further purification.

Synthesis of
[Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18][PPh4]3 (1)
In a typical synthesis,
100 mg of Cu(OAc)2·H2O and 32 mg of TPPTPB
were dissolved in a mixed solvent of 2 mL of methanol and 4 mL of
CH2Cl2, followed by the addition of 30 μL
of HSPhCl2 under vigorous stirring. After 20 min, 3 mL
of an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (30 mg/mL) was added dropwise
to the reaction mixture. After being aged for 3 h at 25 °C, the
aqueous phase and precipitate were removed, whereas the organic phase
was concentrated and washed with MeOH/H2O (4:1 by volume)
several times and then dissolved in CH2Cl2 for
further analysis. By diffusion with hexane at 4 °C for 1 week,
bright-red single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction study were
obtained with 18% yield based on copper. With the same procedures,
instead of NaBH4, NaBD4 was used to synthesize
the deuterium analogue (1D).

Single-Crystal Analysis
The diffraction data of all compounds
were collected on an Agilent Technologies SuperNova system and an
X-ray single-crystal diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54184 Å) at 100 K. The data were processed using CrysAlisPro.51 All structures were solved
and refined using full-matrix least-squares based on F2 with ShelXT and ShelXLwithin Olex2 programs.52−54

Hydrogenation of Ketone
A total of 0.1 μmol of 1 and 50 μmol of 2-hexanone or 3-hexanone was dissolved
in CH2Cl2 within a well-stirred autoclave. Once
sealed, the autoclave was purged three times with hydrogen and then
pressurized to 40 bar. The reaction was then allowed to proceed, and
samples were withdrawn at regular intervals, filtered, and analyzed
to monitor product distribution by gas chromatography. The analysis
was performed with a FuLi 9790II gas chromatograph, equipped with
a split/splitless injector, a capillary column (KB-5, 30 m ×
0.32 mm × 0.33 μm), and a flame ionization detector. Clusters 1 and 1D were re-collected
from the solution for further study.

Measurements of Optical
Properties
Pure crystals were dissolved in Spectro-grade
CH2Cl2 for spectrum measurements. UV/vis absorption
spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer using
a quartz cuvette of 1 mm path length. The signal of the blank solvent
was subtracted. For each spectrum, eight scans at a scanning speed
100 nm/min with a data pitch of 0.1 nm were averaged. The spectra
were recorded at room temperature.

Measurements of H NMR
1H NMR and 2H NMR spectra were recorded on
an AVANCE III 850 MHz spectrometer in dichloromethane-d2 and dichloromethane, respectively. Chemical shifts are
reported in parts per million with the internal TMS signal at 0.0
ppm as a standard.

Electrochemical Test
All of the
electrochemical measurements were operated at room temperature in
a three-electrode system on a potentiostat (CHI760E) under N2. A glass carbon electrode (π × (0.2)2 cm2) was selected as the working electrode, and the Pt electrode
(1 × 1 cm2) and saturated calomel electrode served
as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.

Computational
Details
The density functional theory was implemented as
in the GPAW package.55 All of the calculations
were done in a real space grid with a grid spacing of 0.20 Å.
The exchange and correlation effects were modeled using the PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof)
functional.56 The initial structure for
relaxation was obtained directly from the crystallographic data. The
cluster was set in a computational cell with 6 Å of vacuum around
the cluster. As the counterions were removed from the DFT calculations,
the total charge of the system was set to 3–. The structures
were optimized by using a maximum residual force criterion of 0.05
eV/Å. The Bader charge analysis43 was
run on the total DFT electron density. The superatomic nature of the
clusters was studied with Ylm analysis by projecting the
electron states to spherical harmonics centered to the center of mass.57

The optical response of the clusters was
simulated in the linear-response time-dependent DFT scheme with local
density approximation, as implemented in GPAW.58 The transitions were considered up to 4.4 eV.

The
molecular dynamics simulations were run using Langevin dynamics with
a target temperature of 300 K, a friction parameter of 0.01 fs–1, and a time step of 2 fs. The masses of all hydrogen
atoms were increased to the mass of deuterium to allow for the longer
time step.

NMR shifts were calculated using the gauge-including
projector-augmented wave formalism as implemented in pseudopotential
and planewave-based DFT code package Quantum ESPRESSO.59 We used ultrasoft pseudopotentials (http://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudopotentials), kinetic energy cutoff of 680 eV for wave functions, and energy
cutoff of 6800 eV for the charge density. The shifts were calculated
for the structure optimized with a PBE functional using total charge
of 3–. Total chemical shifts of atoms were defined as σ
= σ(ref) – σ(calc), where σ(ref) was fixed
to 28.00 ppm. With the chosen reference, the most upfield 1H NMR signal of the hydrides inside the metal core will be reproduced
in calculations (0.85 ppm; see table in Figure 2).

The activation barriers for the
elementary steps in the catalytic routes considered were calculated
using the climbing image/nudged elastic band method.49 The obtained transition states were confirmed after analyzing
their vibrational frequencies.
