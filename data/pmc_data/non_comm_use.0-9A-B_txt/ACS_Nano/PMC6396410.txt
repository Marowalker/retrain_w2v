Understanding the
self-organization and structural transformations
of molecular ensembles is important to explore the complexity of biological
systems. Here, we illustrate the crucial role of cosolvents and solvation
effects in thermodynamic and kinetic control over peptide association
into ultrathin Janus nanosheets, elongated nanobelts, and amyloid-like
fibrils. We gained further insight into the solvation-directed self-assembly
(SDSA) by investigating residue-specific peptide solvation using molecular
dynamics modeling. We proposed the preferential solvation of the aromatic
and alkyl domains on the peptide backbone and protofibril surface,
which results in volume exclusion effects and restricts the peptide
association between hydrophobic walls. We explored the SDSA phenomenon
in a library of cosolvents (protic and aprotic), where less polar
cosolvents were found to exert a stronger influence on the energetic
balance at play during peptide propagation. By tailoring cosolvent
polarity, we were able to achieve precise control of the peptide nanostructures
with 1D/2D shape selection. We also illustrated the complexity of
the SDSA system with pathway-dependent peptide aggregation, where
two self-assembly states (i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium
state and kinetically trapped state) from different sample preparation
methods were obtained.

==== Body
The study
of biologically relevant
self-assembly is essential for dissecting the molecular basis of biological
events such as protein misfolding and amyloid fibrillation and also
for guiding the design of biomimetic materials.1 Among these, the sequence-defined oligopeptides have attracted
intense interest owing to the high versatility of self-assembled structures
(1D, 2D, and 3D) and the chemical functionality that originates from
the structural complexity of combinations of the 20 natural amino
acids.2−6 Thermodynamically, the free energy landscape of bioensembles can
be perturbed by applying biological and chemical stimuli that alter
the system enthalpy (e.g., chemical
bonding) and entropy (e.g., solvation
effects).7−13 Through altering the molecular structures and thereby the intermolecular
forces, sequence-coding peptide aggregation and hydrogelation can
be rationally modulated by external stimuli including pH, light, metal
ions, and enzymes.14−18 For instance, alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed dephosphorylation of
phosphorylated tyrosine residues was demonstrated to efficiently promote
the hydrogelation of short peptides, enhance the supramolecular ordering
at nanoscale, and regulate cancer cell fate.18−20 Biological
self-assembly can be also regulated via entropic
control. One example is the protein denaturation induced by urea,
which interacts favorably with the peptide backbone via hydrogen bonding. This acts to shift the conformational equilibrium
toward the unfolded ensemble by allowing greater solvation of hydrophobic
side chains.21

The complexity of
molecular self-assembly in biological systems
also lies in their thermodynamic nonequilibrium features (e.g., metastable and kinetically trapped
states). One example is the fibrillation of amyloid proteins, a process
that is not only guided by the thermodynamic energy landscape but
also modulated by the kinetics of self-assembly and multiple competing
fibrillation pathways, leading to amyloid polymorphism.22 In supramolecular systems, complex pathways
can play an important role in determining the outcome of self-assembly.23−37 Pathway-driven complex self-assembly originates from a combination
of different noncovalent intermolecular forces that govern molecular
interactions and spontaneous aggregation, where nonequilibrium states
can emerge under specific conditions. Such pathway-dependent self-assembly
has become an attractive strategy to construct dynamic materials with
a multitude of diverse structures.23−37

Biologically, the influence of the solvation effect on biomolecules
has a strong impact on the energetics and kinetics of chemical processes
in solution including protein folding, micellization, enzyme–substrate
recognition, and the formation/stability of lipid membranes.38,39 In particular, the interaction of protein molecules with water and
the involvement of water molecules in protein conformational change
and enzymatic reaction have been extensively explored. The changes
in excluded volume and contact interaction with the surface of a protein
have been suggested as the mechanisms responsible for the changes
in cosolvent-induced protein stability. Moreover, solvation has been
reported to play a decisive role in guiding the self-assembly of polymers
and amphiphilic peptides.40−44 For example, trace amounts of solvents were reported to modulate
dipeptide (Phe–Phe) self-assembly in dichloromethane, in which
solvent-bridged hydrogen bonding is demonstrated as a crucial force
in directing fiber formation.43

In
this work, we report the phenomenon of solvation-directed self-assembly
(SDSA) and its ability to precisely control peptide propagation with
1D/2D selectivity and systematically examine the solvation effect
with a library of cosolvents (protic and aprotic) both experimentally
and computationally. We applied molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate
the interactions beween cosolvents and key amino acid segments of
the peptide and hydrophobic protofibril surfaces, through which we
highlight the essential roles of the cosolvent polarity in mediating
peptide solvation and self-assembly. We further observed pathway-dependent
peptide self-assembly in the SDSA system, where distinct supramolecular
products with 1D/2D structure selection were obtained from different
sample preparation methods. We believe that the study of solvation
effects in this work can provide a better understanding of biomolecule–solvent
interactions and a strategy to thermodynamically and kinetically control
the self-assembly of biological molecules of varied structure and
function.

Results and Discussion
We synthesized an asymmetric
peptide amphiphile (F6C11) containing
a hexaphenylalanine (Phe6), a hydrocarbon tail (C11), and
glutamic acids (Glu), which self-assembles into Janus single-layer
nanosheets with ∼5 nm thickness (Figure 1) as we recently reported.45 The design was such that the aromatic stacking in the y-axial and H-bonding in the x-axial direction
directed peptide association in both directions. The crucial role
of aromaticity of phenylalanine was highlighted by the self-assembly
of a mutated peptide where phenylalanine was replaced by 3-cyclohexyl-l-alanine. As shown in Figure S1,
the mutated peptide aggregates into nanobelts with smaller diameters.
The presence of hydrophobic interactions between C11 alkyl chains
also contributes to peptide propagation in both directions.46,47 Collectively, a thermodynamic energy balance defined by contributions
from H-bonding, π–π stacking, and the hydrophobic
effect resulted in the formation of Janus nanosheets. Such energetic
balance can be perturbed by adjusting molecular interactions via modification of the peptide sequences. For example,
helical nanofibrils became energetically favored when the strength
of π–π stacking in the y-axial
direction was weakened by reducing the number of phenylalanine residues
(i.e., Phe5, Phe4, and Val6).45 Here, we hypothesized that
the intermolecular forces, especially the aromatic stacking (Figure 1b), could also be
modulated by introducing a cosolvent to adjust the peptide–solvent
interactions without having to change the chemistry of peptide structures.

Figure 1 (a) Asymmetric
peptide (F6C11) containing one glutamic acid (Glu)
at the C-terminus, two glutamic acids (Glu2) at the N-terminus,
six phenylalanine residues (Phe6), and a hydrocarbon chain
(C11). (b) Schematic of solvation-directed self-assembly with 1D and
2D shape selectivity: formation of 2D nanosheets in aqueous solution
is proposed to be guided by hydrogen bonding in the x-axial direction, π–π stacking in the y-axial direction, and hydrophobic effect in both directions.
Amyloid-like fibrils are the thermodynamically favored products in
the presence of cosolvents (i.e., n-propanol), where the strong solvation effect of aromatic and alkyl
groups by n-propanol are supposed to weaken the π–π
stacking and hydrophobic effect.

To test our hypothesis, we added methanol as a cosolvent
to the
growth solution of F6C11 and studied the morphological changes of
peptide nanostructures. As shown in Figure 2a,b, the length (L) of the
nanosheets increased from 1.41 ± 0.14 to 2.37 ± 0.28 μm
with methanol concentration increasing from 0 to 5%. The elongation
of the 2D nanosheets continued upon increasing the methanol concentration
to 10%, generating nanobelts of 6.74 ± 1.30 μm in length
(Figure 2c). Interestingly,
when the methanol content reached 15%, amyloid-like nanofibrils with
a diameter (D) of ∼11 nm became the dominant
products (Figure 2d).
We propose that peptide molecules can propagate in two dimensions
driven by the intermolecular forces in the x- and y-axial directions (Figure 1). As the methanol content increases, peptide assembly
in the y-axial direction is less favored (discussed
later), and as a result, more peptide monomers will propagate in the x-axial direction, which increases the length of peptide
nanostructures. The morphological changes were also seen in the length/diameter
ratio (L/D) of peptide nanostructures
(Figure 2e–h),
which increased from 2.6, 4.8, 14, to 31 as methanol concentration
increased from 0, 5, 10, to 15%. Such changes were confirmed by structure
illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging stained with a hydrophobic dye
(Nile red, Figure S2). Meanwhile, the decrease
in optical density (OD) of the peptide solution (Figure 2j) confirms the nanosheet-to-nanofibril
transition with the addition of methanol. We also employed Thioflavin
T (ThT, Figure 2k)
assay to probe the strength of peptide–peptide stacking. We
noted that ThT fluorescence decreased as the methanol concentration
is greater than 12.5%, suggesting that the rigid peptide stacking
becomes less ordered, in agreement with the 2D-to-1D morphological
transition. Circular dichroism (CD, Figure 2i) spectra of the nanosheets are indicative
of the existence of β-sheets with a positive peak at 201 nm
and a negative peak at 225 nm, both of which were red-shifted from
typical β-sheet peaks of 196 and 218 nm, respectively. This
is known to be due to the aromatic interactions between phenylalanine
groups that act to distort the β-sheets.48−50 Increasing
the methanol content resulted in the gradual decrease in CD signals,
showing again that the ordered peptide stacking was weakened. Notably,
the preformed nanofibrils can transform into nanosheets when the methanol
was removed from the system via solvent exchange
(Figure S3).

We further investigated the effect
of other alcohols on SDSA with
ethylene glycol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, which have the relative polarity (ETN) of 0.79, 0.654, 0.617, and 0.586, respectively.51 Unlike methanol, the presence of 5% ethanol
in the peptide growth solution led to the formation of elongated nanobelts
(Figure 3a), whereas
nanofibrils formed with high concentrations of ethanol (10–15%, Figure S2). For the less polar n-propanol and n-butanol, amyloid-like fibrils become
the preferred morphologies when 5% cosolvents are present (Figure 3b,c). In the case
of polar ethylene glycol, nanosheets were the favored morphology in
the presence of 5% cosolvent (Figure 3d). These results indicate that SDSA is also dependent
on the cosolvent polarity, where less polar cosolvents (e.g., n-propanol and n-butanol) can induce the nanosheet-to-nanofibril transition more
efficiently than polar cosolvents do (e.g., ethylene glycol, methanol, and ethanol). We further examined
the CD spectra of the peptide solution to compare the effect of cosolvent
polarity on the peptide arrangements (Figures S5 and S6). In comparison with methanol, the presence of ethanol
and n-propanol weakened the strength of F6C11 β-sheet
structures in a more efficient manner, as can be seen from the decreased
CD intensity at 201 and 225 nm. Interestingly, further addition of
cosolvents above a threshold concentration (7.5% of ethanol or 5%
of n-propanol) caused a CD spectral distortion away
from the β-sheet. The interpretation of the CD spectra at high
cosolvent contents is still unclear at this stage. However, from the
combined results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CD,
we have come to the conclusion that cosolvents with a lower polarity
(e.g., n-butanol
and n-propanol) are more efficient in causing 2D-to-1D
structural transformation of peptide self-assembly. Moreover, the
cosolvent-induced peptide fibrils remain single-layer structures (2–3
nm), as indicated from the atomic force microscopy (AFM, Figure S7). This thickness is less than that
of peptide nanosheets, which is probably because the peptide solvation
induced by cosolvents unfavored the extended peptide conformation.

(0.25 mM) in the presence of different alcohols (5%): (a) ethanol,
(b) n-propanol, (c) n-butanol, (d)
ethylene glycol. Peptide nanofibrils were the thermodynamically favored
morphology in the presence of less polar cosolvents like n-butanol and n-propanol, whereas nanosheets were
the dominant morphology when the cosolvent is more polar (e.g., ethylene glycol). A cosolvent with
intermediate polarity (e.g., ethanol)
drives F6C11 self-assembly into elongated nanobelts. Scale bar: (a,d)
1 μm; (b,c) 200 nm.

We further explored the alcohol–peptide interactions
by
molecular dynamics (Figure S8) simulation
to reveal the role of the cosolvents (i.e., methanol,
ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol)
in determining peptide self-assembly. Figures S9 and S10 present the behavior of individual F6C11 molecules
in the solvent mixture (5% cosolvent), showing the radial distribution
function (RDF) between the alcohol (oxygen and terminal carbon) and
peptide molecules. All alcohol molecules showed affinities toward
the alkyl tail (C11) and hexaphenylalanine group (Phe6)
higher than those of the terminal glutamic acid (Figures S9 and S10). It can also be seen from the higher and
broader RDF peaks that the association of the less polar solvents
(e.g., n-propanol
and n-butanol) with the hydrophobic groups (C11 alkyl
and Phe6) relative to bulk concentration was stronger than
polar cosolvents (e.g., methanol
and ethanol). We assessed the distributions of the fraction of solvent-accessible
surface area (SASA) of the six phenylalanine (Phe6) residues
covered by methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and n-butanol (Figure 4a–d), where the average available SASA of the Phe6 region was ∼1000 Å2. The simulations
suggest that, on average, 131, 151, 208, and 379 Å2 of the Phe6 surface is covered by methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, respectively.
Similarly, the SASA of the C11 alkyl tail in F6C11 peptide covered
by methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol was calculated to be 148, 187, 271, and 554 Å2, respectively (Figures 4e and S11). The surface coverage
was found to increase with decreasing solvent polarity (e.g., n-propanol and n-butanol). It was also noted that the surface-bound solvent molecules
on charged amino acids (i.e., Glu2 and
Glu) were less than those around hydrophobic Phe6 and an
alkyl tail (Figures S12 and S13).

F6C11 molecules covered by (a) methanol, (b) ethanol, (c) n-propanol, and (d) n-butanol. The average
SASA of the Phe6 region is ∼1000 Å2, and on average, 131, 151, 208, 379 Å2 of the Phe6 surface is covered by methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, respectively. (e) Average

group; Glu: glutamic acid at the C-terminus. Note: numbers in (e)
are slightly different by ±0.2% from those in (a–d) due
to rounding in figures (a–d).

The aggregation of F6C11 into a protofibril resulted in the
formation
of a hydrophobic wall along the sides of the protofibril due to the
presence of hydrophobic phenylalanine side chains (Figures 5a and S14). This hydrophobicity did not translate to the ends of
the protofibril where the backbone of the F6C11 molecules was exposed.
The hydrophobic wall appeared to act as a small surface prone to association
with nonpolar components of the cosolvent. Figure 5b,c shows example snapshots of the F6C1110 protofibril along with the methanol and propanol present
within 4 Å of the protofibril. Distributions for the fraction
of the Phe6 region covered by the alcohols are shown in Figure 5d–g. There
was a dramatic increase in coverage from 18.9 and 29.4% for methanol
and ethanol, respectively, to 46.9 and 64.2% for n-propanol and n-butanol, respectively. Identical
trends were observed for the coverage of the C11 alkyl chain region
(Figures 5h and S15), where 18.5, 28.7, 48.3, and 67.7% coverage
was found for methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol, respectively. In contrast, the SASA coverage
translates to the ends of the protofibril where the backbone of hydrophilic
Glu2 (N-terminus) and Glu (C-terminus) ends of F6C11 was
substantially less impacted by solvent polarity (Figure 5h and Figures S16 and S17).

solvents. Glu2: two glutamic acid at the N-terminus; Phe6: phenylalanine; C11: alkyl group; Glu: glutamic acid at the

We propose that the association
of peptide monomers or protofibrils
into nanosheets is limited due to the volume exclusion effects associated
with the interaction between less polar solvents and the hydrophobic
wall of the peptides and the associated protofibrils, preventing the
β-sheet stacking in the y-axial direction (Figure 1). We observed nanosheet
formation in the presence of more polar cosolvents as the aforementioned
volume exclusion effects were more limited and the association of
these hydrophobic walls was subsequently possible. The large entropy
cost associated with the 1D-to-2D structural transition was likely
compensated by the dewetting of the hydrophobic walls of the protofibrils,
a driving force that was not present in more nonpolar cosolvents.
This agrees with our previous finding that nanofibrils were the dominant
product when the aromatic interaction and hydrophobic effect were
weakened by removing phenylalanine and alkyl chains.

We further
tested the effect of other protic cosolvents (Table 1), where less polar
cosolvents (e.g., isobutyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol) favor the formation
of nanofibrils at a 5% cosolvent concentration (Figure S18). In contrast, protic cosolvents with two or more
hydroxyl groups (e.g., ethylene
glycol and propane-1,3-diol) do not induce peptide fibrillation when
the cosolvent concentration is below 15% (Figure S19a–d). Due to the high polarity (ETN = 0.812),
glycerol did not affect the 2D morphology of F6C11 self-assembly (Figure S19e,f). This agrees with the previous
finding that glycerol stabilized amyloid oligomerization and retarded
fibrillar aggregation via enhanced hydration.39

Furthermore, we screened
a library of aprotic cosolvents and investigated
their effects on solvation-induced self-assembly (Table 1). Interestingly, precise control
over 1D/2D peptide self-assembly was achieved by subtle changes in
molecular structures of cosolvents. For example, formamide and N-methyl formamide, which are relatively polar with an ETN of 0.775 and 0.722, respectively, favored the formation of nanosheets
and elongated nanobelts at a concentration of 5% cosolvent (Figure 6a,b). In contrast,
the less polar N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF, ETN = 0.386) that has two additional −CH3 groups on the nitrogen (N) atom led to the formation of nanofibrils
(Figure 6c). This was
the same for N,N-dimethylacetamide
(ETN = 0.377), which has two −CH3 groups on
the nitrogen atom and one −CH3 on carbonyl group
(Figure 6d).

self-assembly in the presence of aprotic solvents (5 v/v%): (a) formamide,
(b) N-methyl formamide, (c) N,N-dimethylformamide, (d) N,N-dimethylacetamide. Noteworthy, the decrease of polarity from formamide
(ETN = 0.775), N-methyl formamide (ETN = 0.722), N,N-dimethylformamide
(ETN = 0.386), and N,N-dimethylacetamide
(ETN = 0.377) leads to a structural transition from nanosheets
to elongated nanobelts and nanofibrils. Scale bar: (a–c) 500
nm, (d) 250 nm.

Moreover, we have observed
that only those cosolvents with ETN lower than 0.62 can thermodynamically
promote peptide fibrillation
(Figure S20), including acetonitrile (ETN = 0.460), dimethyl sulfoxide (ETN = 0.444), acetone (ETN = 0.355), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (ETN = 0.355),
2-butanone (ETN = 0.327), tetrahydrofuran (ETN = 0.207),
and 1,4-dioxane (ETN = 0.164). Here, the cosolvents were
grouped into two categories: the strong inducing solvent with ETN of ∼0.164–0.654 and the weak inducing solvent with
high polarity ETN of ∼0.713–1. As suggested by MD simulations,
less polar solvents had a larger surface coverage on the Phe6 segment and the C11 hydrocarbon chains, competing with the peptide
solvation effect in water and weakening the peptide propagation in
the direction perpendicular to H-bonding, which energetically favored
1D peptide self-assembly.

We noticed that the solvent-induced
self-assembly can be also explained
by dielectric constant (ε). For example, the solvents with a
high dielectric constant such as N-methyl formamide
(ε = 170), propane-1,3-diol (ε = 35), methanol (ε
= 32.6), formamide (ε = 109), ethylene glycol (ε = 37),
and glycerol (ε = 42.5) were not able to induce peptide fibrillation,
whereas cosolvents with lower dielectric constants favored the formation
of peptide fibrils. There are exceptions such as N,N-dimethylacetamide (ε = 37.8), N,N-dimethylformamide (ε = 36.7), acetonitrile
(ε = 37.5), and dimethyl sulfoxide (ε = 46.7), which are
more polar than methanol (ε = 32.6) or propane-1,3-diol (ε
= 35) but still trigger peptide fibrillation. In this sense, compared
to the dielectric constant, the relative polarity (ETN) is believed
to better correlate with the SDSA because ETN is a parameter directly
determined by the solvatochromic effect or solvent–solute interaction.
On the other hand, solvation of charged headgroups (Glu2 and Glu) by organic cosolvents is less profound (Figure 5) as water plays a dominating
role in solvating the ionic amino acids.

Recent work has shown
that the degree of complexity in supramolecular
systems is dependent on the specific self-assembly pathway.23,24,26,29,32−36,53 For example, a peptide
amphiphile can self-assemble into different supramolecular morphologies
depending on the sample preparation pathway, either into long filaments
containing β-sheets or smaller aggregates containing peptide
segments in random coil conformations.24 In the system of F6C11, the self-assembly of SDSA is pathway-dependent,
where the method of sample preparation affected the supramolecular
products. As shown in Figure 7a, we used two sample preparation methods to guide peptide
self-assembly in the presence of cosolvents. Following Pathway I,
we directly added the peptide F6C11 to the buffered growth solution
containing the desired amount of cosolvents and observed a thermodynamic
equilibrium state (#1) of the amyloid-like fibrils (Figure 7) as shown in the section above.
The formation of thermodynamically stable 1D peptide fibrils is ascribed
to the selective solvation of alkyl and aromatic groups by cosolvents,
which prevents the β-strand stacking in the direction perpendicular
to the β-sheet. Following Pathway II, we added the same amount
of cosolvents to the preformed F6C11 nanosheets, generating a kinetically
trapped state (#2). In the nonequilibrilium state, nanosheets were
the dominant morphology (Figure 7g–j). The nanosheets prepared following Pathway
II did not disassemble or transform into nanofibrils over an observable
time frame (>2 months). Even though the peptide systems in states
1 and 2 contained the same amount of F6C11 and cosolvent content,
we observed significant differences in the morphologies of the self-assembled
structures. Moreover, these two self-assembly pathways also caused
significant differences in peptide–peptide association at molecular
level, where strong β-sheet structures were retained in state
2, as shown from ThT fluorescence (Figure 7k–n). We propose that once the F6C11
are well-packed into nanosheets through the synergistic forces of
H-bonding, hydrophobic effect and aromatic stacking, the access of
cosolvents to the hydrophobic face of peptide backbones is restricted
and therefore the 2D structures will be in a nonequilibrium but kinetically
trapped state (#2). Following Pathway I, however, a strong solvation
effect or solvent–peptide contact results in the formation
of thermodynamically stable fibrils.

self-assembly, where Pathway I led to a thermodynamic equilibrium
state corresponding to the formation of fibrils (state 1), and Pathway
II resulted in a kinetically trapped state corresponding to nanosheets
(state 2). Pathway I: aggregation of F6C11 monomers was completed
in aqueous solution containing cosolvents. Pathway II: cosolvents
were added to preformed F6C11 nanosheets. (c–h) TEM images

Conclusions
To
conclude, we explored the potential of solvation effects to
ellicit delicate control of peptide self-assembly into 1D and 2D nanostructures
by using a library of cosolvents. Cosolvents with lower polarity (lower ETN) selectively interacted with alkyl and Phe6 segments
of peptide amphiphiles. This resulted in volume exclusion effects
and a weakening of the peptide association between hydrophobic walls,
which then prevented β-sheet stacking. For the polar solvents,
the aforementioned volume exclusion effects were more limited and
the association of these hydrophobic walls was subsequently possible.
We highlighted the complexity of the solvation effect in peptide self-assembly
by demonstrated the existence of a kinetically trapped state. We anticipate
this work can shed light on the design of peptide-based biomaterials
and the modulation of protein structure and function (e.g., amyloid fibrillation, enzyme–substrate
recognition, and protein–protein interaction).

Experimental Section
Reagents and Materials
All Fmoc-protected
amino acids,
Rink Amide resin, and 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate were purchased from Anaspec, Inc. The peptide
F6C11 was prepared according to our previous paper.45 All the other reagents were used as received.

Preparation
of Peptide Nanostructures
A stock solution
of 10 mM F6C11 was prepared in hexafluoro-2-propanol to completely
break the hydrogen bonding between peptide molecules. Following Pathway
I, 10 μL of peptide stock solution was injected quickly into
a 390 μL solution containing phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7)
and desired amount of cosolvents. The mixture was sonicated for 20
s and stored at room temperature overnight. Following Pathway II,
the preformed peptide nanosheets in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7)
were mixed with desired amount of cosolvents. The mixture was sealed
and stored at room temperature.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM was performed
on a JEM 2100F with an acceleration voltage of 200 keV, and the images
were recorded with an Orius camera. TEM samples were prepared using
the negative-staining method. Briefly, a drop of solution was deposited
onto a carbon-coated 200 mesh copper grid for 5 min. Excess solution
was wiped away using a filter paper. Subsequently, the grid was stained
with a drop of uranyl acetate (1.0 wt %) solution for 3 min. Excess
staining agent was removed using a filter paper and the sample was
dried in air. The calculation of L/D of peptide nanosheets, nanobelts, and nanofibrils was performed
using ImageJ.

Fluorescence Measurements
The ThT
assay was performed
in a 384-well plate with a total volume of 80 μL. The peptide
solutions were incubated with 10 μM ThT overnight before measurement.
Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SpectraMax M5 plate
reader with an excitation of 440 nm.

Circular Dichroism
CD spectra were recorded using a
Jasco-715 circular dichroism spectrophotometer at 20 °C. The
samples were loaded into a rectangular quartz cell with the light
path length of 1 mm. The peptide concentration was 0.25 mM dissolved
in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0).

Structured Illumination
Microscopy
Self-assembled peptide
nanostructures were stained with Nile red (5 μM) and diluted
in phosphate buffer. The solution was absorbed on a positively charged
microscope slide (SUPERFROST PLUS, Thermo Scientific) and mounted
with 22 mm high-precision coverslips (Thermo Scientific) and sealed
with clear nail varnish. SIM imaging was conducted on a Zeiss Elyra
PS1 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany).

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM was performed on an AFM
5500 microscope (Keysight technologies, previously Agilent). The measurements
were performed in ambient atmosphere. A HQ:NSC15/Al BS tip (μmasch)
was used (tip radius <8 nm, force constant of 40 N/m, resonance
frequency of 325 kHz in tapping mode (measured resonance frequency
= 274.432 kHz). AFM images were analyzed using Gwyddion 2.49.1.54 Prior to fiber measurements, data were processed
by a level mean plate subtraction and rows were aligned using the
median.

Model Construction
The initial model of the F6C11 molecule
was constructed with all amino acid residues in the β-sheet
arrangement and the connecting alkyl chain in an extended conformation.
The F6C1110 fibrillar aggregate fragment was built by aligning
10 molecules with a space of 0.4 nm between adjacent molecules. The
F6C11 and F6C1110 structures were solvated with approximately
6000 water molecules and counterions and then equilibrated by MD simulation
for 20 ns in the NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and
temperature) ensemble.

Water–alcohol mixtures were generated
based on mass fractions equivalent to 5% v/v and subsequently equilibrated
in the NPT ensemble. The mixtures contained between 176 and 399 alcohol
molecules, depending on size, immersed in a 3D periodic box containing
approximately 17000 water molecules. The pre-equilibrated single F6C11
or F6C1110 fibril was then inserted into each of the equilibrated
solvent mixtures. To remove unfavorable contacts, water or alcohol
molecules overlaying the F6C11 molecules in systems were shifted,
and the systems were equilibrated for 1 ns with the F6C11 atoms fixed.
An all-atom representation of the F6C11 molecule and primary alcohol
molecules was used with the intra- and intermolecular interactions
being modeled by a combination of the CHARMM362,3 and
CGenFF36 potentials. Water molecules were treated explicitly using
the TIP3P water model.4

Simulation
Setup
Molecular dynamics simulation as implemented
in NAMD (version 2.10)5 software was used
for all the work reported here. In all simulations, a cutoff distance
of 12 Å was applied for nonbonded interatomic interactions with
switching applied between 10 and 12 Å. Long-range electrostatic
interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method.6 A time step size of 2 fs was used in all simulations,
with O–H bond lengths constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.7 NPT simulations were undertaken using a Langevin
thermostat8 and Langevin piston Nose-Hoover
method9,10 to control the temperature and pressure
at 298 K and 1 atm, respectively. Equilibration runs for the F6C11
molecule and fibrillar systems were performed for 220 and 120 ns,
respectively, with an output frequency of 10 ps. Analysis was performed
on the final 100 ns for each system using VMD.11

SASA Calculations
All SASA calculations
were performed
using the method developed by Connolly12 as implemented in VMD with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. For each
frame the SASA of each region of the F6C11 molecule(s) was calculated
by restricting the calculation to that region of the F6C11 molecule(s)
to give a SASAAll for each region. A second calculation
was performed with the selection including both the F6C11 molecule(s)
and organic solvent molecules within 5 Å of the F6C11 and applying
the same restriction to give SASA(R_OS). The difference
between SASAAll and SASA(R_OS) gives the total
area of the region of the F6C11 molecule(s) covered by organic solvent,
SASACOV. Dividing SASACOV by SASAAll gives the fraction of the region of the F6C11 molecule(s) covered
by organic solvent. Distributions for SASACOV are shown
in Figures 4 and 5 and Figures S11–S13 and S15–S17.
