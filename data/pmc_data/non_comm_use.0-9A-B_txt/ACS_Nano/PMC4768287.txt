Surface
reactive nanostructures were fabricated using stimulated
emission depletion (STED) lithography. The functionalization of the
nanostructures was realized by copolymerization of a bifunctional
metal oxo cluster in the presence of a triacrylate monomer. Ligands
of the cluster surface cross-link to the monomer during the lithographic
process, whereas unreacted mercapto functionalized ligands are transferred
to the polymer and remain reactive after polymer formation of the
surface of the nanostructure. The depletion efficiency in dependence
of the cluster loading was investigated and full depletion of the
STED effect was observed with a cluster loading exceeding 4 wt %.
A feature size by λ/11 was achieved by using a donut-shaped
depletion beam. The reactivity of the mercapto groups on the surface
of the nanostructure was tested by incubation with mercapto-reactive
fluorophores.

==== Body
In the midnineties,
Hell and
Wichmann proposed stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy1 as new concept of scanning fluorescence microscopy
which allows to break the diffraction limit in optical imaging.2,3 Meanwhile, STED is a state of the art method with even sub-10 nm
resolution.4 As proposed in the early work
on STED microscopy,2,3 the STED concept was expected
to be also apt to increase resolution in optical lithography. In three-dimensional
optical lithography, cross-linked polymers are formed via multiphoton-induced
polymerization by focusing an ultrashort pulsed laser into an acrylate
monomer mixed with a photoinitiator.5 In
STED-enhanced multiphoton lithography, a second laser locally inhibits
the ability of the photoinitiator to start the polymerization in the
outer rim of the point spread function (PSF).6 The polymerization volume is thus confined, which allows for structuring
of nanometer-sized features. Recently realized STED- and STED-inspired
lithography are the only methods allowing diffraction-unlimited structuring
with visible light in three dimensions. STED lithography facilitates
writing features with lateral structure sizes of 55 nm and a resolution
of 120 nm.7 Some other STED-inspired techniques8−11 were proven to write features even with sub-50 nm resolution.12 Applications of STED lithography range from
nanostructured photonic materials, 3D data storage, to life-science.13−18

STED lithography is currently limited to only one class of
materials,
which is radically polymerized (meth)acrylates. In fact, STED lithography
has been realized with only a few different types of (meth)acrylate
monomers, and true STED lithography has only been shown with a single
photoinitiator, namely 7-diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin (DETC) (Figure 1c).6,19−21 Alternative STED-related techniques use other photoinitiators
but still rely on (meth)acrylates as the photoresist. This severely
restricts a covalent and targeted attachment of molecules (such as
proteins) or metallization of the structures unless a further chemical
modification of the polymer is performed.22−24 Lately, research
on reactive photoresists, which enable facile subsequent covalent
modification, was carried out. Functionalized polymers25 have been found to be particularly useful in
fabrication of reactive hydrogels26,27 or thiol-ene-reactive
structures,28 capable of binding proteins
or metals.

Thus, there is a need in the development of new functional
monomers
which can be applied in STED lithography. STED lithography, however,
sets the following restrictions on the resin formulation: (I) The
monomer must be strongly cross-linking to ensure the formation of
polymer nanostructures with high mechanical strength. This is important
to prevent breakdown of the structure during the development process.
(II) To reduce aberrations of the point spread functions, the refractive
indices of the monomer and the glass should match. (III) The resin
must not show absorption in the wavelength regions of the excitation
and depletion lasers.

In the last few years, copolymerization
of organic monomers and
transition metal oxo clusters with polymerizable ligands by a variety
of polymerization techniques yielded cluster-cross-linked polymers
with improved thermal and mechanical properties.29 Thereby, the clusters can be incorporated in the organic
matrix without loss of their structural integrity. Exchanging part
of the polymerizable methacrylate ligands of the clusters by ligands
with a different organic functionality results in bifunctional clusters.
By incorporation of transition metal oxo clusters in organic matrices,
the intrinsic properties of the cluster (e.g., magnetical, optical,
electronical properties) are transferred to the polymer.30,31 Furthermore, the great number of polymerizable ligands on the cluster
surface leads to strong cross-linking and enhanced mechanical properties.
Additionally, the facile preparation of bifunctional clusters makes
this class of compounds interesting for the preparation of functional
structures. Clusters are typically obtained in a one-step reaction
as crystalline products with high yield and purity, and easy-to-perform
protocols for ligand exchange reactions exist.32 On the contrary, purely organic based monomers which are
bifunctional and strongly cross-linking are typically prepared by
multi step synthesis protocols and show low yields over all synthesis
steps.

Herein, we report structuring of multiphoton and STED
lithographically
fabricated structures employing a metal oxo cluster based resin with
thiol functionality. We use the methacrylate-substituted zirconium
oxo cluster Zr4O2(OMc)12 (Zr4, Figure 1a),33 whose methacrylate ligands
(OMc) were partially exchanged against 3-mercaptopropionate ligands
to introduce a mercapto-group as second functionality. The methacrylate
ligands participate in the polymerization reaction and link the cluster
covalently to the acrylate network. The mercapto-substituted ligands
serve as anchor points for further functionalization after polymer
formation. To the best of our knowledge, resins containing bifunctionalized
clusters have not been applied in STED lithography before.

We
are aware that parts of the mercapto functionalized ligands
participate in thiol–ene polymerization and the underlying
chemistry was described before.34−36 However, unreacted mercapto functionalized
ligands remain reactive on the surface of the structure for further
reactions, as will be outlined below.

Results
Specifically,
13% and 24% of the methacrylate ligands were exchanged
against 3-mercaptopropionate ligands by treatment of the cluster Zr4 with 1.5 or 3 equiv of 3-mercaptopropionic
acid. The NMR spectra of all clusters of this work are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1 and Figure
S2). It was shown before that exchange of carboxylate ligands of Zr4 proceeds with retention of the cluster core
structure.32 Determining the proportion
of exchanged ligands, however, is not possible by NMR spectroscopy.
The ligands on the cluster surface undergo fast dynamic exchange,37 which results in a broadening of the NMR signals
and makes an integration of the signals ambiguous. However, exact
determination of the number of ligands is possible when the cluster
core is destroyed by treatment with a strong acid after the exchange
reaction (see Methods section) and the NMR
signals of the corresponding acids are integrated (see Figure S2). The composition of the bifunctional
clusters was thus determined as Zr4O2(OMc)10.4(OPrSH)1.6 (ZrSH1,
OPrSH = 3-mercapto propionate, 13% of the ligands exchanged) and Zr4O2(OMc)9.1(OPrSH)2.9 (ZrSH2, 24% of the ligands exchanged).

A
scheme of the STED lithography setup is presented in Figure 1b and explained in
detail in ref (7).
Woodpile photonic crystals and lines were fabricated to demonstrate
the applicability of the new resin for multiphoton and STED lithography.
Cluster-based resins were obtained by mixing dichloromethane (DCM)
solutions of metal oxo clusters with the monomer pentaerythritol triacrylate
(PETA) and subsequent evaporation of the solvent, as described in
the Methods section. 0.25 wt % 7-diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin
(DETC) was used as photoinitiator in all experiments (chemical structures
are shown in Figure 1c). The resin PETA with 0.25 wt % DETC showed good performance in
STED lithography before.6,7 In order to test the
functionality of the mercapto groups after polymerization, two- and
three-dimensional structures with 1 wt % of ZrSH1 were covalently functionalized with Alexa647-maleimide as
sketched in Figure 2a. Control structures with cluster-free resin and with 1 wt % Zr4 doped resin (without mercapto groups) were
also fabricated. All structures were incubated for 20 min in an aqueous
Alexa647-maleimide solution and subsequently washed as described in
the Methods section. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy (LSM) images of all structures were recorded before and
after incubation. Figure 2b shows a three-dimensional reconstructed image of a woodpile
structure. The DETC fluorescence is represented in blue (Figure 2b, central panel)
and the specifically bound Alexa647-maleimide is shown in red (Figure 2b, right panel).
The main panel in Figure 2c depicts an LSM fluorescence image of a mercapto functionalized
slice of a woodpile structure after incubation as top view, evidencing
the attachment of the Alexa647-maleimide. The control structures written
with pure PETA/DETC, that is, without any clusters, or with resist
containing Zr4 clusters, which carry only
methacrylate but no thiol groups, (Figure 2c, small panels) both did not show a significant
fluorescence signal in the red channel after incubation. Statistics
of the intensity of the fluorescence signal for the mercapto-functionalized
structure and both negative controls are shown in Figure 2d. The gray bars represent
the emission of DETC (green channel, excitation at 488 nm), which
is present in the same concentration in all photoresists. The fluorescence
signals are therefore the same for all three analyzed structures.

structure of pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA, monomer), 7-diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin
(DETC, photoinitiator) and the emission and absorption spectrum of

Excitation at 647 nm
(red channel of the LSM) shows that the fluorescence
of the Alexa647 marker is increased 30-fold in the case of the mercapto
functionalized structure containing 1 wt % ZrSH2 compared to the unreactive structures. The low residual signal
of the unfunctionalized structures originates from unspecific binding
of Alexa647-maleimide and is similar for all three samples.

Structures called “depletion patterns” were written
to characterize the STED performance of the PETA/oxo cluster resists.
Lines are written using varying excitation (at 780 nm) and depletion
(at 532 nm) powers, whereas both the excitation and the STED PSFs
were ordinarily shaped as shown in the top image of Figure 3a. The lines in one column
of the depletion pattern are created with a constant excitation power
while each line is written with different STED powers, which results
in different line heights. In the case of the second column of the
SEM image, the AFM profile is shown to the right of the SEM image.
Within each column (constant excitation power), the depletion power
was increased from 0–27 mW in 42 similar steps (bottom to top
in Figure 3a). For
left to right columns, the excitation power was increased, starting
from 3.8 mW and increasing in 0.1 mW steps until an excitation power
of 4.2 mW was reached (from left to right in Figure 3a). Depletion patterns were written for resins
with concentrations of ZrSH1 or ZrSH2 ranging from 1–4 wt %. Figure 3b shows the results for the
resists containing 1 wt % ZrSH1 as an example.
Results for other compositions are shown in the Supporting Information. For all experiments, the first (bottom)
and the last line (top) of the depletion curves were written without
applying the depletion beam. Figure 3b shows line height profiles of depletion patterns
determined from AFM scans. For instance, the orange stars in Figure 3b show the height
of the lines as a function of ascending STED power. Up to 2 mW (taken
in front of the objective lens), the line height is rapidly decreasing
with increasing STED power. Lines are totally suppressed for STED
intensities from 3 mW to 12 mW.

From 13 mW onward, lines reappear,
however, they are now written
due to either Anti-Stokes or two-photon absorption of 532 nm light
from the STED beam.21,38 This region of STED intensity
needs to be avoided. The depletion curves for the resin containing
3 wt % ZrSH2 are shown in Figure S3a and b shows a comparison of resins containing 1
wt % ZrSH1 and 1 wt % of ZrSH2.

From the depletion experiments, we determine a doping
of the photoresist
with 4 wt % of clusters (Zr4 and ZrSH1) as the maximum concentration which allows for
complete structure suppression in the observed power range from 3.8
to 4.2 mW. The data indicate that higher cluster proportions increase
residual absorption of the STED laser, which counteracts depletion.
Similar trends were determined using clusters differing in the proportion
of mercaptopropionate ligands (ZrSH1 and ZrSH2, Figure S3).
The data show that depletion by STED depends on the amount of clusters
in the polymers and also on the number of mercapto groups per cluster.
The resin containing 1 wt % of ZrSH1 showed
a lower parasitic polymerization due to large STED powers than the
resin containing ZrSH2. Representative depletion
curves for resins with 3 wt % ZrSH2 are
shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

Next, experiments for characterizing the lateral restriction
of
the polymer structure were carried out. Lines were written in a resin
containing 2.5 wt % ZrSH2 with an excitation
power of 3.2 mW.

The green depletion laser with a power of 7.8
mW was switched on
for a short sequence (see Figure 3c). The writing volume was thereby restricted by the
donut-shaped PSF of the depletion laser. By switching on the depletion
laser, the line diameter decreased from 100 to 72 nm, which corresponds
to a restriction of 28%.

Three different photoresists were used: pure PETA with 0.25 wt % DETC

large confocal image shows the signal from the Alexa647-maleimide
attached to the mercapto groups in the polymer. The upper small image
shows unspecific binding of Alexa647-maleimid to a woodpile structure
without any Zr cluster, the lower small image shows unspecific binding
to acrylates containing 1 wt % Zr4 (LSM
images were scaled identically). (d) Bar diagram showing the background
corrected fluorescence signal in the green channel (DETC fluorescence)
and the red channel (Alexa647).

AFM images of lines written using a photoresist with 1 wt % of ZrSH1. While structuring, the donut-shaped
depletion beam has been partially blocked. In the case where the STED
beam was on, the lines became thinner. The inset shows the fluorescence
of the STED lithographically written lines after covalent attachment
of Alexa647-maleimide proving that the thiol functionalization is
active also in the STED lithographically written structures.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a successful fabrication of nanostructures by combining
STED lithography with functional polymers has been demonstrated. Using
metal oxo clusters, mercapto-functionalized structures with feature
sizes of 72 nm were realized. The reactivity of the thiol groups of
the clusters in the polymerized structures has been demonstrated by
incubation with Alexa647-maleimide. The combination of STED lithography
with resists containing a second functional group offers a promising
possibility for numerous applications, for example a covalent attachment
of proteins, DNA or antigenes for cell behavior studies or the precise
tuning of the physical and chemical surface properties of 2D and 3D
structures.

Lithography
Setup
The two-photon polymerization starters
were excited with 780 nm ultrashort laser pulses (FemtoRay780, 50
MHz repetition rate, 100 fs pulse duration, Menlo Systems GmbH, Germany)
and were locally depleted in the outer rim of the point spread function
with a depletion beam (532 nm, continuous wave, Verdi-V5, Coherent,
U.S.A.). The 532 nm depletion beam was shaped into a donut form using
a 2π spiral phase mask (RPC Photonics, U.S.A.) and a λ/4
plate converting the depletion beam into a circularly polarized beam.
Both beams were focused through an oil immersion objective lens (Zeiss
α-plan Apochromat, 100×, numerical aperture NA = 1.46).
Power adjustment of the excitation beam was provided by an acousto-optic
modulator (Q1133, Isomet, U.S.A.). An avalanche photo diode (APD-SPCM-AQRH,
PerkinElmer Optoelectronic Inc., U.S.A.) was used for aligning the
foci. A three axes piezo stage (P-562.3CD, Physik Instrumente PI,
Germany) with a bidirectional positioning accuracy of 2/2/4 nm and
a travel range of 200 × 200 × 200 μm, is used for
sample motion. The high-precision stage was mounted on top of a coarse x–y motor stage (M-686.D64, Physik
Instrumente PI, Germany) with a travel range of 25 × 25 mm. The
stages were driven in closed loop with two controllers (E710.3CD and
C-867.260, both from Physik Instrumente PI, Germany). For sample positioning,
recording of images and controlling the writing process, a LabView
(LabView 2011, National Instruments Corporation, U.S.A.) program was
used.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
Specific binding
between Alexa647-maleimide and a woodpile structure was quantified
by a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany).
Images were taken using a 63×, NA = 1.4 oil DIC Plan-Apochromat.
Generally, image sizes were 101.6 × 101.6 μm (line rate
of 0.03 ms) by 3.6 μm (22 z-stacks). Samples
were illuminated using 488 and 647 nm (Laser modules LSM 700) and
after spectral filtering, the fluorescence was imaged on photomultiplier
tubes (using the green or red channel of the LSM 700, respectively).
The Zen data processing software (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) was used
for image visualization; additionally, images were analyzed using
MATLAB (The MathWorks GmbH, Germany). For the analysis, the images
were background corrected and fluorescence signals were averaged.

Combined Fluorescence Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy
The sample was sealed by a home-built camber and rinsed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). AFM measurements were performed using a NanoWizard 3
(JPK Instruments AG, Germany) system mounted on an Axiovert 200 inverted
microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). The microscope is equipped with
a 100× NA = 1.46 oil-immersion Plan-Apochromat TIRFM objective
(Olympus, Japan) and a 20× NA = 0.8 Plan-Apochromat objective
(Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). Samples were illuminated in epifluorescence
configuration via the epiport using 488 nm (250 mW) and 647 nm (250
mW) light from diode lasers (Toptica Photonics, Germany), or 532 nm
light from a solid state laser (Millennia X, Spectra Physics, U.S.A.),
with intensities of 3–10 kW/cm2. After appropriate
filtering, emitted signals were imaged on a back-illuminated, TE-cooled
CCD-camera (Andor iXon Du-897, UK). Acousto-optical modulators (1205C,
Isomet, U.S.A.) were used for the precise control of the illumination
timing. Timing protocols were generated by an in-house program package
implemented in LabView (LabView, National Instruments Corporation,
U.S.A.). Illumination times were adjusted to values between 1 and
5 ms. The sample surface was first imaged with the fluorescence microscope
to determine an appropriate site for the AFM measurements. Topographical
images were recorded in Quantitative Imaging mode at room temperature
in liquid (PBS) at a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels. The maximum
force determined by the vertical deflection of the cantilever was
set to 300 pN. Force distance cycles (scan rates) were controlled
by the z length (250 nm), extension time (10 ms)
and retraction time (50 ms). We used uncoated silicon cantilevers
(MSNL-10, Bruker Corporation, U.S.A.) with a nominal spring constant
in the range of 0.01–0.03 N/m. The spring constant for each
cantilever was calibrated using the thermal noise method. JPK data
processing (JPK Instrument, Germany) software was used for image analysis.39−42 The height, adhesion and slope of the force curve were collected
simultaneously in both trace and retrace directions. Height images
were line-fitted as required. Isolated scan lines were occasionally
removed.

NMR Spectroscopy
Solution NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE 250 (250.13 MHz {1H}, 62.86 MHz {13C}). Gas-tight Young tubes were used for all experiments.
CD2Cl2 was purchased from Euriso-Top and degassed
by freeze–pump–thaw cycles.

IR Spectroscopy
Solid state ATR-IR spectra were recorded
on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 400 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a KBr
window for MIR and a polyethylene window for FIR. A total of 128 scans
were averaged for MIR and 256 scans were averaged for FIR measurements.

Photoresist
The used monomer was pentaerythritol triacrylate
(PETA) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., U.S.A.) including 300–400 ppm monomethyl
ether hydroquinone and 0.25 wt % 7-diethylamino-3-thenoylcoumarin
(DETC) (Acros Organics, Belgium) as initiator. Zr-clusters were mixed
into the resist as described below.

Preparation of the Clusters
All operations involving
the preparation of the clusters and the ligand exchange reactions
were performed in nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques.
Hexane and toluene were dried over Na/benzophenone prior to use. DCM
was distilled over CaH2. Methacrylic acid (99%, Sigma-Aldrich
Co., U.S.A.) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co,
U.S.A.) were freshly distilled over P2O5 prior
to use. Zr(OPr)4 (70 wt % in propanol) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Zr4O2(OMc)12 (Zr4) was prepared as previously
reported.33

Ligand Exchange Reactions
Ligand exchange reactions
were performed according to the procedure reported in ref (32). 3-Mercaptopropionic acid,
18.4 μL (0.22 mmol, 1.5 eq. in the case of ZrSH1) or 36.9 μL (0.44 mmol, 3 eq. in
the case of ZrSH2), was added
dropwise to a solution of 200 mg (0.14 mmol, 1 equiv) of Zr4 in 5 mL of CH2Cl2 and stirred
for 30 min. After removing the solvent, the residue was washed multiple
times with toluene, redissolved in 0.5 mL of CH2Cl2 (DCM) and precipitated with 50 mL of hexane. The white precipitate
was separated, washed again three times with toluene, and dried under
vacuum.

Determination
of the Number of Exchanged Ligands
A
total of 50 mg of ZrSH1 or ZrSH2 was suspended in D2O and 10 μL of DCl was added. The solution was sonicated for
60 min before recording 1H NMR spectra. The ratio of methacrylic acid
and 3-mercaptopropionic acid was determined according to the ratio
of the integrals of the methyl group of methacrylic acid (1.77 ppm,
3H) and the —CH2CH2SH signal of mercaptopropionic
acid (2.60 ppm, 4H) and was found to be 1:0.2 for ZrSH1 and 1:0.42 for ZrSH2. Thus, 13% of the methacrylate ligands were exchanged
against mercapto propionate ligands in ZrSH1 and 24% in ZrSH2. The composition of ZrSH1 was therefore Zr4O2(OMc)10.4(OPrSH)1.6 and that of ZrSH2 Zr4O2(OMc)9.1(OPrSH)2.9.

Doping of
the Photoresist with Clusters
Different proportions
of Zr4, ZrSH1 or ZrSH2 dissolved in CH2Cl2 (100 μL of the solvent per 5 mg Zr-cluster) were used. The
maximum amount of clusters, which can be dissolved in the photoresist
was 5 wt %. However, complete depletion of the formation of structures
by STED can be achieved only up to a 4 wt % proportion of clusters
in the resin.

For structuring, 10 μL of the resist were
pipetted onto untreated microscope coverslips (Menzel Gläser,
Germany) with a thickness of ca. 0.17 mm. The solvent was removed
under vacuum at room temperature for about 20 min. In the development
process, DCM was used as solvent.

Maleimide Functionalization
The specific binding efficiency
was assessed by using Alexa647-maleimide. The stock solution was dissolved
with distilled water to obtain a final 10 mM concentration. The maleimide
side of the linker binds covalently to accessible mercapto groups
in the polymer structure (Figure 2a). The samples were incubated for 20 min and subsequently
washed three times.
