Thermoresponsive materials are generating
significant interest
on account of the sharp and tunable temperature deswelling transition
of the polymer chain. Such materials have shown promise in drug delivery
devices, sensing systems, and self-assembly. Incorporation of nanoparticles
(NPs), typically through covalent attachment of the polymer chains
to the NP surface, can add additional functionality and tunability
to such hybrid materials. The versatility of these thermoresponsive
polymer/nanoparticle materials has been shown previously; however,
significant and important differences exist in the published literature
between virtually identical materials. Here we use poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)-AuNPs as a model system to understand
the aggregation behavior of thermoresponsive polymer-coated nanoparticles
in pure water, made by either grafting-to or grafting-from methods.
We show that, contrary to popular belief, the aggregation of PNIPAm-coated
AuNPs, and likely other such materials, relies on the size and concentration
of unbound “free” PNIPAm in solution. It is this unbound
polymer that also leads to an increase in solution turbidity, a characteristic
that is typically used to prove nanoparticle aggregation. The size
of PNIPAm used to coat the AuNPs, as well as the concentration of
the resultant polymer–AuNP composites, is shown to have little
effect on aggregation. Without free PNIPAm, contraction of the polymer
corona in response to increasing temperature is observed, instead
of nanoparticle aggregation, and is accompanied by no change in solution
turbidity or color. We develop an alternative method for removing
all traces of excess free polymer and develop an approach for analyzing
the aggregation behavior of such materials, which truly allows for
heat-triggered aggregation to be studied.

Stimuli-responsive
polymers
exhibit changes in properties upon exposure to small variations in
environmental conditions, e.g.,
light, ionic strength, pH, or temperature.1−4 This characteristic can be utilized
in the formation of stimuli-responsive drug delivery materials, such
as hydrogels,5−7 micelles,8−10 vesicles,11,12 and polymer–nanoparticle (NP) composites.13−15 Thermoresponsive
polymers are commonly used in such systems on account of their biocompatibility
and sharp yet tunable temperature-responsive phase transitions.16 A number of synthetic and natural polymers exhibit
thermoresponsive behavior, such as poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate]
(POEGMA),17 poly(N-diethylacrylamide)
(PDEAm),18 and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAm),16 each with its own lower critical
solution temperature (LCST) behavior and tunable temperature range.

PNIPAm, which is one of the most widely studied thermoresponsive
polymers, undergoes a phase transition in pure water from hydrophilic,
fully hydrated polymer chains to hydrophobic-collapsed chains at temperatures
around 30–34 °C. Upon heating, PNIPAm becomes insoluble
and precipitates from solution; the temperature at which this occurs
is referred to as a lower critical solution temperature. This effect
is independent of the concentration or molecular weight of the PNIPAm
chains.19 The LCST of PNIPAm is also readily
tunable by controlling the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the
polymer, often achieved by copolymerization with a second monomer
such as N-hydroxyethylacrylamide (HEAm) or N,N′-dimethylacrylamide (DMAm).20 Such polymers can readily be attached to other
materials such as gold surfaces and NPs, leading to thermoresponsive
materials with enhanced properties over the individual components.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are of particular interest
to researchers
due to their unique optical and electronic properties, and coating
with PNIPAm produces a core–shell system whereby the AuNPs
are encapsulated in a thermoresponsive polymer shell. Such composites
have been shown to have interesting applications in drug delivery,21,22 catalysis,23 photodynamic therapy,24 triggered release mechanisms,25 and other biologically relevant applications.22,26 Much work has focused on the synthesis of PNIPAm-AuNP core–shell
systems using techniques such as in situ reduction
of gold salts in the presence of thiol-terminated PNIPAm,27 direct polymerization from the AuNP surface,28−30 referred to as “grafting-from”, and the “grafting-to”
approach, where preformed polymers are used to coat AuNPs by ligand
exchange.31,32 Methods utilizing the direct polymerization
from the AuNP surface (grafting-from) can lead to poorly controlled
and difficult to define polymer sizes. However, a grafting-from approach
should not allow for any “free” polymers to form in
solution, a fact that we show is important in the aggregation behavior
of PNIPAm-AuNPs (vide infra). A grafting-to approach
offers the most accurate and reproducible method for controlling both
the size and dispersity of the AuNPs, as well as the size and PDI
of the attached PNIPAm polymers, but leads to excess unbound polymer.33

Whether made by a grafting-to or grafting-from
approach, the resultant
PNIPAm-AuNPs are often very similar in size and structure and yet
are regularly shown to have differing properties in response to temperature.
This has led to a significant contradiction in the published literature
of similar PNIPAm-AuNP core–shell structures, synthesized using
different approaches. Choi etal. have shown that PNIPAm-AuNPs formed via a grafting-from
approach exhibit a size decrease upon heating above the LCST,28 whereas Chakraborty etal. and Raula etal.,
who also made PNIPAm-AuNPs via a grafting-from approach,
show aggregation in response to an increase in temperature.29,30 Typically, PNIPAm-AuNPs formed via a grafting-to
approach are shown to aggregate upon heating, which is usually reported
by observing a change in solution turbidity above the LCST.31 However, such grafting-to systems have also
been reported that exhibit shell collapse.32 Studies have also investigated the effects of salt concentration
on the aggregation behavior of grafting-to PNIPAm-AuNPs, with increased
salt concentrations leading to greater degrees of aggregation.34,35 These apparent contradictions were highlighted in a recent review,
with factors such as nanoparticle size and grafting density being
suggested to play an important role in aggregation.36

Herein, we use PNIPAm-coated AuNPs to fully investigate
the factors
that control aggregation of thermoresponsive-nanoparticle materials.
We report an alternative approach for the efficient removal of all
unbound “free” PNIPAm present after synthesis, by manipulating
the LCST of PNIPAm through solvent addition, which is confirmed by
thermogravimetric analysis. We then proceed to show, for the first
time, that PNIPAm-coated AuNPs can show both a decrease in size or
aggregate upon heating, solely by controlling the presence of unbound
“free” PNIPAm in solution. When no free PNIPAm remained
in solution, no change in turbidity upon heating above the LCST was
observed, highlighting that this method of characterization is less
than optimal. On account of this, we have developed a new UV/vis-based
method for characterizing thermoresponsive nanoparticle materials
that allows for the degree of aggregation to be accurately monitored
and absolute values calculated. UV/vis analysis was conducted alongside
dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis to confirm that shell collapse
or aggregation can be readily controlled. It is shown that complete
aggregation occurs only above a critical concentration of free PNIPAm
and that this concentration is dependent on the molecular weight (MW)
of the free PNIPAm in solution. Conversely, the concentration of PNIPAm-AuNPs
and length of the PNIPAm coating of the AuNPs have little effect on
the aggregation. This work explains the contradiction in the literature
regarding PNIPAm-AuNP systems and offers procedures for effectively
removing excess PNIPAm as well as for characterizing the aggregation
behavior, which will lead to greater reproducibility in such thermally
responsive materials.

Results and Discussion
In order
to fully investigate the aggregation behavior of PNIPAm-coated
AuNPs, it was necessary to synthesize nanoparticles of different sizes,
to investigate the effect of surface curvature, by using both the
grafting-from and grafting-to approaches. Grafting-from PNIPAm-AuNPs
were synthesized using a one-phase approach and bis[2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)undecyl]
disulfide as the initiator on the AuNP surface, giving AuNPs of ∼4
nm in size. Atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was then used
to grow polymer chains from the surface of the AuNPs in an approach
similar to that used on flat gold surfaces. A grafting-from approach
will typically lead to a system in which polymer chains do not exist
in solution, on account of initiators being present only on the nanoparticle
surface. Nevertheless, these grafting-from PNIPAm-AuNPs were washed
to remove any PNIPAm chains that may be present in solution on account
of insufficient removal of all free initiator from solution.

Grafting-to PNIPAm-AuNPs were prepared by first synthesizing thiol-terminated
polymers and AuNPs separately, followed by mixing. PNIPAm was synthesized
with three MWs, small (15 000), medium (30 000), and
large (60 000), using RAFT polymerization (Figure S1a). Cleaving the chain transfer agent (CTA) of the
PNIPAm in the presence of hydrazine yielded thiol-terminated polymers
(HS-PNIPAm) with controllable MWs (Figure S1b). Cleavage of the CTA using azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) and
1-ethylpiperidine hypophosphite (EPHP) afforded a hydrogen-terminated
polymer (H-PNIPAm) (Figure S1C) for control
systems and for use as free polymer in solution. The LCST of these
polymers was found to be ∼32 °C in all cases, both before
and after cleavage.

The majority of AuNPs used in this synthesis
were synthesized using
the Turkevich method,37 to give 14 nm AuNPs.
A seed-mediated approach38 that yields
AuNPs sub-10 nm in size was also used as a comparison to those synthesized via the grafting-from approach. Smaller AuNPs have much
higher degrees of curvature and greater surface-area-to-volume ratios
and have different amounts of PNIPAm per AuNP compared to those produced via the Turkevich route, a factor that has been suggested
to affect the aggregation behavior of the PNIPAm-AuNPs.36 Mixing and incubation of the as-synthesized
AuNPs with the HS-PNIPAm for 48 h yields PNIPAm-AuNPs. In comparison
to a grafting-from approach, a grafting-to approach allows for control
over both the AuNP (core) size and PNIPAm (shell) length/size but
can lead to excess polymer in solution.

Initially, the as-prepared
grafting-to polymer-coated nanoparticles
were washed using 3× centrifugation washes with water. It was
noted that before purification complete precipitation of the PNIPAm-AuNPs
from solution was observed upon heating. During the purification procedure
heating led to an increase in turbidity but no aggregation, and after
complete purification (approximately >20 washes) there was no visible
change in solution color or turbidity. A cooled centrifuge aids in
the purification process by reducing the number of washes required;
however more than three washes were still required to reach a point
where no visible change in solution color or turbidity is observed
upon heating. This observation led us to investigate the washing procedure
in more detail and develop an improved, more versatile method. It
was noted that when performing the standard literature washes, in
an uncooled centrifuge, excess PNIPAm would aggregate and precipitate
on account of an increase in temperature of the solution. In order
to overcome this issue, methanol (∼2 equiv) was introduced
into the solution before washing. By introducing methanol the LCST
behavior of PNIPAm is arrested, and so when the solution was heated,
no aggregation was observed. By using four centrifugation–wash
cycles at 12100g, with methanol, with >95% supernatant
removal, pure PNIPAm-AuNPs were readily obtained and their purity
was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S3).

Figure 2 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data showing the change
in hydrodynamic
radius (Rh) as the temperature is increased
for (a) graft-from PNIPAm AuNPs and (b) graft-to PNIPAm-AuNPs before
(blue circles) and after (red squares) the addition of 40 μmol
(2.4 mg) of free 60k H-PNIPAm.

When pure PNIPAm-AuNPs (i.e., no free PNIPAm) synthesized using either approach
were
analyzed by DLS, using a temperature sweep from 25 to 40 °C,
a decrease in Rh was observed, due to
deswelling and collapse of the PNIPAm chains. Figure 2a shows the (as expected) decrease in shell
size of pure graft-from PNIPAm-AuNPs upon heating (blue circles) and
also that aggregation can be induced upon the addition of 40 μmol
of “free” H-PNIPAm (red squares). Figure 2b shows the effect of heating on graft-to
AuNPs coated with a 60k PNIPAm, both before and after the addition
of free H-PNIPAm chains to the solution. For the PNIPAm-AuNPs formed via a grafting-to approach, aggregation above the LCST of
the PNIPAm was expected, but was not observed even if the increased
temperature was maintained for more than 18 h. Additionally, there
was no visible change in the solution color, which is characteristic
of AuNP aggregation, on account of the coupling of the AuNPs’
surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We observed that these PNIPAm-AuNPs
were capable of aggregation before washing, and thus, we investigated
the effect of adding free PNIPAm back into the previously cleaned samples.

A portion of the 60k PNIPAm that
had originally been reacted to
yield a thiol terminus was cleaved to remove all trace of thiol and
leave a H-terminus (H-PNIPAm). When the H-PNIPAm was added to pure
PNIPAm-AuNPs, aggregation above the LCST began to occur. As the amount
of free H-PNIPAm was increased, the degree of aggregation increased
until complete aggregation from solution was observed. Figure 2 (red squares) shows the effect
of heating on the same 14 nm AuNPs coated with 60k PNIPAm in the presence
of 2.4 mg/mL (4 × 10–5 mol mL–1) free 60k H-PNIPAm. It can clearly be seen that above the LCST aggregation
occurs and the Rh increases drastically,
leading to complete precipitation of the AuNPs from solution, suggesting
cooperativity between free polymer chains and polymer chains on the
surface of the NPs leading to aggregation.16 This aggregation was accompanied by the solution becoming turbid
upon heating. The same trend was observed for small AuNPs made via either a grafting-to or grafting-from approach (Figures 2 and S2), highlighting again that nanoparticle size
has no effect on the aggregation behavior.

From analysis of
the literature it is expected that the larger
PNIPAm-AuNPs, synthesized using a grafting-to approach, would aggregate
upon heating31 and PNIPAm-AuNPs synthesized
using a grafting-from approach would show shell collapse.28 However, in both cases, PNIPAm-AuNPs that had
been washed fully showed no signs of aggregation (Figure 2). The addition of free PNIPAm
was necessary to cause aggregation in all of the synthesized (and
completely purified) PNIPAm-AuNPs. As this observation was contrary
to the published literature, a more detailed investigation was needed
to fully understand and explain these results. For this, due to their
more controlled synthesis and reproducibility, PNIPAm-AuNPs synthesized via a grafting-to approach were selected as our model system,
a decision supported by the observation that, once pure, each type
of PNIPAm-AuNP system behaves the same as the other.

Using larger
(14 nm) PNIPAm-AuNPs coated with 60k PNIPAm formed
by a grafting-to approach, it was possible to investigate how much
free H-PNIPAm is required to completely aggregate the AuNPs. Larger
particles also allow for the investigation into the reversibility
of the system. Figure 3a shows the purified 14 nm PNIPAm-AuNPs (1 mg/mL), above and below
the LCST of PNIPAm (red and blue, respectively), before the addition
of free H-PNIPAm. It can clearly be seen that no aggregation occurs
above the LCST. Figure 3b shows the same sample, above and below the LCST, after the addition
of 1.6 mg of H-PNIPAm. When this sample is heated above the LCST it
is clear that a small degree of aggregation takes place, on account
of the slight change in solution color and turbidity and the formation
of visible aggregates. Figure 3c shows the same sample after the addition of a further 1.8
mg of H-PNIPAm. It can clearly be seen that the degree of aggregation
of the AuNPs is much greater as the amount of free H-PNIPAm is increased.
If the aggregation is caused by free H-PNIPAm only, then its removal
should yield a sample that exhibits the same polymer chain collapse
and decrease in size as the initially purified PNIPAm-AuNPs.

nm 60k-PNIPAm-coated AuNPs (1 mg/mL) taken above and
below the LCST, red and blue, respectively. (a) Pure PNIPAm-AuNPs,
(b) PNIPAm-AuNPs after the addition of 1.6 mg of H-PNIPAm, and (c)
PNIPAm-AuNPs after the addition of a further 1.8 mg of H-PNIPAm.

The sample of PNIPAm-AuNPs that
now contains 3.4 mg of free H-PNIPAm
and exhibits a reversible aggregation of the AuNPs upon heating was
subjected to an alternative wash procedure. After washing with methanol
four times the AuNPs were dried and redispersed in H2O.
This material now exhibited none of the aggregation behavior observed
in the presence of free H-PNIPAm, instead exhibiting a decrease in Rh upon heating. This experiment demonstrates
that the reversible aggregation of PNIPAm-AuNPs is caused by excess
PNIPAm in solution and that the amount of free polymer can determine
the degree of aggregation, especially considering that removal of
the free PNIPAm halts the aggregation behavior.

In order to
quantify the amount of free polymer required to fully
aggregate the PNIPAm-AuNPs, a UV/vis study was developed. This method
involved the addition of small portions of H-PNIPAm to 14 nm AuNPs
coated with 60k PNIPAm. After addition, the samples were heated to
45 °C and centrifuged at 1200g for 6 min. Centrifugation
removes all large aggregates but is not able to remove unaggregated
PNIPAm-AuNPs. After centrifugation the supernatant is collected, cooled,
and then analyzed using UV/vis spectroscopy. As the concentration
of AuNPs in solution is closely linked to the absorbance of the solution,
it was possible to determine if any AuNPs had been removed. The absorbance
intensity at 400 nm was used to monitor AuNP aggregation, as this
wavelength corresponds mainly to the absorbance for gold atoms, due
to interband transitions, and is not red-shifted by any aggregation
of the AuNPs, as would be the case for the plasmon absorbance at 525
nm.39,40 As the concentration of 60k H-PNIPAm was
increased, a clear and sharp decrease in the absorbance of the solution
was observed (Figure 4a). This indicates that the PNIPAm-AuNPs had aggregated and been
removed from the solution upon reaching a critical concentration of
H-PNIPAm. We believed that the concentration of H-PNIPAm required
to cause aggregation would be linked to the MW of the free H-PNIPAm.
In order to investigate this, 60k PNIPAm-coated AuNPs were mixed with
H-PNIPAm with MWs of 60k, 30k, and 15k. It was observed that as the
MW of the free H-PNIPAm decreased, the concentration required to cause
aggregation increased (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 Absorbance of 14 nm AuNPs coated with 60k PNIPAm, (a) 14 nm AuNPs
coated with 15k, 30k, and 60k PNIPAm, mixed with aliquots of 60k H-PNIPAm
and (b) mixed with aliquots of 15k, 30k, and 60k H-PNIPAm, after heating
above the LCST, and large aggregates have been removed via heated centrifugation at low g.

It was also possible to investigate the effect
of PNIPAm MW when
bound to the AuNPs. A range of PNIPAm-AuNPs coated with 15k, 30k,
and 60k polymers were prepared and washed as before. Each PNIPAm-AuNP
solution was mixed with aliquots of 60k H-PNIPAm and analyzed using
the UV/vis method. The results show that the MW of the surface-bound
PNIPAm has little, if any, effect on the concentration of free H-PNIPAm
required to aggregate the AuNPs (Figure 4b).

In order to confirm that the aggregation
of PNIPAm-AuNPs is indeed
due to the presence of free polymer in solution, a second PNIPAm with
a higher LCST was synthesized. By incorporating 10% of the hydrophilic
monomer N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide into the PNIPAm
chain (P[NIPAM-co-HEAm]) it is possible to increase
the LCST to 38 °C. When P[NIPAM-co-HEAm] is
added to AuNPs coated with 60k PNIPAm, the same trend is observed;
that is, an excess (3.4 mg) of H-P[NIPAM-co-HEAm]
must be added to cause complete aggregation of the PNIPAm-AuNPs (Figure S5). As the LCST of the PNIPAm bound to
the AuNPs is 32 °C and that of the free polymer has now been
increased to 38 °C, it is possible to confirm which polymer is
responsible for the aggregation. By heating the solution of PNIPAm-AuNPs
with free P[NIPAM-co-HEAm] to 35 °C, the free
polymer in solution will not collapse, whereas the nanoparticle-bound
polymer will. It can be seen in Figure 5 that when this sample is heated to 35 °C, no
aggregation occurs, as the H-P[NIPAM-co-HEAm] is
not above its LCST. This observation further confirms that the aggregation
behavior is dependent on the free polymer chains in solution.

Conclusions
For the first time,
we have studied in detail the factors that
affect the aggregation behavior in water of PNIPAm-AuNPs as a model
system for thermoresponsive polymer–nanoparticle materials.
Contradictions in the published literature on virtually identical
materials are common, with packing density due to the synthetic route
being suggested to be the cause. We show that the aggregation is likely
due to excess polymer chains still present after inadequate washing.
By synthesizing PNIPAm-AuNPs of different sizes and via different grafting techniques we have fully investigated the factors
that affect thermoresponsive polymer–nanoparticle composites.
Clearly, the current literature procedure of washing using centrifugation
for the purification of PNIPAm-AuNPs is inadequate. The alternative,
more versatile, washing procedure allowing for the complete removal
of excess polymer yields pure PNIPAm-AuNPs. Pure
PNIPAm-AuNPs made via either a grafting-from or grafting-to
approach exhibit the same property of shell collapse upon heating
above the polymer LCST. The aggregation behavior has been shown to
be dependent on the presence of free PNIPAm chains in solution, with
the degree of aggregation being dependent on free PNIPAm concentration
and MW. This was investigated using a UV/vis-based study that allows
the amount of free PNIPAm required to cause aggregation to be easily
determined. By synthesizing a P[NIPAM-co-HEAm] random
copolymer, with a higher LCST, it was further confirmed that such
aggregation is due purely to the presence and concentration of free
polymer. This new-found understanding of PNIPAm-AuNP systems, in addition
to the washing and aggregation determination procedures detailed herein,
should assist in the further development of these and other similar
dynamic materials, toward a variety of applications.

Methods
Materials and General Methods
All
starting materials
were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich and used as received
unless stated otherwise. 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were
recorded using a Bruker Avance QNP 400. Chemical shifts are recorded
in ppm (δ) in D2O with the internal reference set
to δ 4.67 ppm. Spectroscopy studies were performed on a Varian
Cary 100 Bio UV–vis spectrophotometer. The GPC system for determination
of molecular weight distributions comprised a Jordi Gel DVB, a Shimadzu
SPD-M20A Prominence diode array, and a Wyatt Optilab DSP interferometric
refractometer. THF was used as the eluent at 35 °C and a flow
rate of 1 mL/min–1. The GPC system was calibrated
using narrow polystyrene standards. Samples were filtered through
0.45 μm PTFE filters before injection. DMF GPC was performed
on two Jordi 5 μm DVB-Glucose columns connected in series with
an SPD-M20A Prominence diode array detector and refractive index detector
(both Shimadzu) calibrated in relation to poly(methyl methacrylate)
standards. Samples were filtered through 0.45 μm nylon filters
before injection using a 0.75 mL/min flow rate. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) characterization was carried out by a JEOL 2000FX
TEM under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Samples were prepared
by applying one drop of the as-synthesized gold nanoparticles onto
a holey carbon coated copper TEM grid (400 mesh). High-g centrifuge experiments were conducted using an Eppendorf Minispin
centrifuge at 12100g for 30 min at room temperature.
Low-g heated centrifugation was conducted using a
Thermo Electron Corporation SPD131DDA SpeedVac concentrator at 60
°C. All aqueous solutions were made in deionized water treated
with a Milli-Q reagent system ensuring a resistivity of >15 MΩ
cm–1.

Synthesis of Alcohol-Terminated Chain Transfer
Agent (CTA-OH)
CTA-OH was synthesized following a previously
reported method.41 Briefly, ethanthiol
(2 g, 32.2 mmol) was added
to a stirred suspension of tribasic potassium phosphate (7.2 g, 33.9
mmol) in acetone (50 mL), and the mixture stirred at room temperature
for 45 min. Carbon disulfide (7.35 g, 96.5 mmol) was added, and the
mixture stirred for a further 45 min. 4-(Chloromethyl)benzyl alcohol
(5.04 g, 32.2 mmol) was then added, and the reaction mixture left
to stir overnight at room temperature. Once the reaction was complete,
the mixture was filtered and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure.
The solid residue was then dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed with
water and brine, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The ethyl acetate
was removed under reduced pressure, and the yellow oil product purified
by column chromatography in ethyl acetate to give a yellow powder
of CTA-OH (5.013 g, 19.4 mmol, 60%). 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz): 1.30 (3H, t, J = 7 Hz), 1.58 (1H, t, J = 6 Hz), 3.31 (2H, q, J = 7 Hz), 4.55
(2H, s), 4.60 (2H, d, J = 6 Hz), 7.26 (4H, m, phenyl).

General Synthesis of SSS-PNIPAm-OH
PNIPAm polymers
were synthesized with a range of Mn’s
(5k–60k g/mol). A general procedure for their synthesis was
as follows. Quantities of each starting material used are given in Table S1, and yields and molecular weights in Table S2. N-Isopropylacrylamide,
CTA-OH, and ACPA were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane in a Schlenk tube.
The solution was degassed by bubbling nitrogen through it for 40 min.
The tube was then sealed and heated in a 70 °C oil bath overnight.
When completed, the polymerization mixture was quenched in liquid
nitrogen and the product isolated as a yellow powder by precipitation
from cold diethyl ether. 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz):
1.07 (6n H, br s), 1.50 (2n H, br
t), 1.94 (1n H, br t), 3.82 (1n H,
br s), 7.25 (4H, dd), where n is the number of repeat
units in the polymer.

General Synthesis of HS-PNIPAm-OH
Cleavage of the trithiocarbonyl
end group to a thiol was performed on all of the SSS-PNIPAm-OH polymers
synthesized. A general method is as follows. SSS-PNIPAm-OH was dissolved
in DMF, and hydrazine monohydrate added. The mixture was stirred for
2–3 h at room temperature. The resulting polymer was precipitated
in cold, acidified diethyl ether to form a white powder. 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz): 1.07 (6n H, br
s), 1.50 (2n H, br t), 1.94 (1n H,
br t), 3.82 (1n H, br s), 7.25 (4H, dd), where n is the number of repeat units in the polymer.

General Synthesis
of H-PNIPAm-OH
Cleavage of the trithiocarbonyl
end group to a hydrogen was performed on SSS-PNIPAm-OH polymers. A
general method is as follows. SSS-PNIPAm-OH and azobis(isobutyronitrile)
were dissolved in DMF. 1-Ethylpiperidine hypophosphite was added to
this solution, and the mixture degassed under nitrogen for 40 min.
The solution was then heated at 100 °C for 3 h. Once the reaction
was complete, the mixture was cooled in ice, precipitated in hexane,
dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight, redissolved in water, and
then freeze-dried to obtain a white powder. 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz): 1.07 (6n H, br s), 1.50 (2n H, br t), 1.94 (1n H, br t), 3.82 (1n H, br s), 7.25 (4H, dd), n being the
number of repeat units in the polymer.

Synthesis of 14 nm Citrate
Gold Nanoparticles
A HAuCl4 stock solution (30
mM, 1.9 mL, 0.057 mol) was diluted in
148 mL of Milli-Q water in a round-bottom flask (RBF), forming a pale
yellow solution. The RBF was fitted with a condenser, and the solution
heated to boiling under vigorous stirring. A stock solution of sodium
citrate was made (MW = 294.1 g/mol, 0.3035 g, 1.03 mmol) in 6.78 mL
of water (making a 152 mM solution). The required amount of sodium
citrate stock solution was injected into the boiling gold salt solution
quickly, with an injection time under one second. The diameter of
nanoparticles synthesized depended on the ratio of sodium citrate
to HAuCl4. For 14 nm AuNPs, 2 mL of sodium citrate was
injected (1:5.33 Au:citrate). The solution changed to a red color
within 10 min and was then left to cool. DLS, TEM, and UV–vis
measurements were used to analyze the synthesized AuNPs.

Functionalization
of 14 nm AuNPs with HS-PNIPAm-OH
A 20 mL amount of 14 nm
AuNPs was concentrated to 1.75 mL and mixed
with HS-PNIPAm (at least 100 mg). The solution was incubated for 48
h to yield PNIPAm-AuNPs.

Purification of 14 nm PNIPAm-AuNPs
The as-prepared
PNIPAm-AuNPs (1.75 mL) were added to MeOH (∼3.5 mL). Centrifugation
at 12100g for 30 min at room temperature allowed
for more than 95% supernatant removal. PNIPAm-AuNPs were redispersed
in MeOH, and the above process was repeated a further three times.
The resultant pure PNIPAm-AuNPs were then dried and redissolved in
1.75 mL of H2O.

Synthesis of 5 nm AuNPs
AuNPs were
synthesized via a seeded-growth method according
to a modified literature
procedure.38,42 A DDAB stock solution was first
prepared by dissolving didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) (925
mg, 2.28 mmol) in toluene (20 mL). HAuCl4 (50 mg, 0.13
mmol) and dodecylamine (DDA) (450 mg, 2.42 mmol) were added to 12.5
mL of the stock solution and sonicated until dissolved. The gold salt
was then reduced by dropwise addition of tetrabutylammonium borohydride
(TBAB) (125 mg, 0.49 mmol) in 5 mL of DDAB stock solution under vigorous
stirring, producing the (4 nm) seed solution, which was aged for 24
h. A growth solution was then prepared by adding 7 mL of the aged
seed to a previously prepared solution containing toluene (50 mL)
with HAuCl4 (200 mg, 0.51 mmol), DDAB (1 g, 2.46 mmol),
and DDA (1.85 g, 7.19 mmol). Finally, hydrazine (131 μL, 4.22
mmol) in 20 mL of the DDAB stock solution was added dropwise under
vigorous stirring, thus preparing a deep red solution of AuNPs (5
nm).

Functionalization of 5 nm Gold Nanoparticles with HS-PNIPAm-60k-OH
In order to successfully functionalize the synthesized AuNPs, it
was necessary to remove excess capping ligands via a washing procedure. MeOH was added to the toluene AuNP solution
in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. After 2 h, precipitation of NPs allows for the
removal of supernatant. The precipitate was redissolved in 1 volume
of MeOH and allowed to stand until all NPs reprecipitated, the supernatant
was removed, and the process was repeated once more. The resulting
precipitate was easily dispersed in toluene/THF (1:1) to give a deep
red solution of AuNPs. PNIPAm-60k-OH (100 mg, 1.7 μmol) was
dissolved in toluene (5 mL) and THF (5 mL) and added to the cleaned
5 nm AuNPs. The solution was incubated for 48 h.

Purification
of 5 nm PNIPAm-AuNPs
Diethyl ether (0.645
mL) was added to the functionalized AuNPs (1 mL) to precipitate the
nanoparticles. The supernatant was removed and the AuNPs were redissolved
in THF (0.5 mL). This process was repeated twice using fresh ether
(0.8 mL), followed by drying. These were redissolved in Milli-Q water
depending on the intended concentration. DLS measurements gave a diameter
for these functionalized AuNPs of 156.0 nm.

Synthesis of Initiator-coated
AuNPs
The initiator bis[2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)undecyl]
disulfide was synthesized following a standard literature procedure.43 The as-synthesized initiator (30 mg, 0.04 mmol)
was mixed with HAuCl4 (35.4 mg, 0.09 mmol) in ethanol (20
mL) and stirred vigorously at room temperature. NaBH4 (200
mg, 5.29 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL), filtered, and then
added dropwise to the gold salt solution. Once all of the NaBH4 solution had been added, the solution was stirred for a further
hour at room temperature. The formed nanoparticles were precipitated
with an excess of hexane and collected by centrifugation. These nanoparticles
were washed extensively (over six times) by dissolving in the minimum
amount of ethanol and precipitating with an excess of hexane.

Synthesis
of Graft-from PNIPAm-AuNPs
A 5 mg amount
of initiator–AuNPs was mixed with N-isopropylacrylamide
(267 mg, 2.36 mmol) in 1 mL of ethanol/water (1:1) and degassed by
bubbling with nitrogen for 30 min. Separately, CuCl (1.77 mg, 0.08
mmol) and tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine (4.109 mg, 0.018
mmol) were dissolved in ethanol/water (1:1) and degassed by bubbling
with nitrogen for 30 min. Once degassed, the copper solution was added
to the nanoparticle/monomer solution. After 1 h the PNIPAm-AuNPs were
washed several times using diethyl ether to precipitate the nanoparticles
and centrifugation to collect them. Pure PNIPAm-AuNPs were then dried
and dissolved in water.

UV–Vis Studies
A UV–vis
spectroscopy
method was developed for the analysis of PNIPAm-induced aggregation
of AuNPs. In this method the PNIPAm-AuNPs are subjected to heating
above the LCST (typically 45 °C) and are then centrifuged at
60 °C at low g using a Thermo Electron Corporation
SPD131DDA SpeedVac concentrator. The supernant, after heated centrifugation,
is then collected and analyzed. To study incremental increases in
free PNIPAm concentrations, small amounts of PNIPAm were added to
the supernant after analysis, and the solution was recombined with
any precipitates generated via heated centrifugation.
This mixture was then cooled on ice to fully dissolve all aggregates
before another cycle of heated centrifugation and analysis was performed.
As the method does not rely on the turbidity of the solution, as is
typically used for such analysis, the actual degree of aggregation
can be determined as opposed to the precipitation of free PNIPAm in
solution and/or aggregation of AuNPs.
