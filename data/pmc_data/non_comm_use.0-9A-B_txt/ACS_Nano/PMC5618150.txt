Determining
the structural origins of amyloid fibrillation is essential
for understanding both the pathology of amyloidosis and the rational
design of inhibitors to prevent or reverse amyloid formation. In this
work, the decisive roles of peptide structures on amyloid self-assembly
and morphological diversity were investigated by the design of eight
amyloidogenic peptides derived from islet amyloid polypeptide. Among
the segments, two distinct morphologies were highlighted in the form
of twisted and planar (untwisted) ribbons with varied diameters, thicknesses,
and lengths. In particular, transformation of amyloid fibrils from
twisted ribbons into untwisted structures was triggered by substitution
of the C-terminal serine with threonine, where the side chain methyl
group was responsible for the distinct morphological change. This
effect was confirmed following serine substitution with alanine and
valine and was ascribed to the restriction of intersheet torsional
strain through the increased hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen
bonding. We also studied the variation of fibril morphology (i.e., association and helicity) and peptide aggregation
propensity by increasing the hydrophobicity of the peptide side group,
capping the N-terminus, and extending sequence length. We anticipate
that our insights into sequence-dependent fibrillation and morphological
diversity will shed light on the structural interpretation of amyloidogenesis
and development of structure-specific imaging agents and aggregation
inhibitors.

amyloid fibrillation
is associated with serious pathogeneses of neurodegenerative disorders
(e.g., Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s
diseases, prion encephalopathies) and progressive diseases (e.g., type II diabetes, light chain amyloidosis, and cystic
fibrosis).1,2 Amyloid fibrillation arises from a misfolding
process in which proteins undergo a 3D structural conversion from
their native form (often soluble) into insoluble fibrillar aggregates.3 Although amyloid fibrils share a common structural
feature based on the continuous stacking of β-sheets, known
as the cross-β structure,4,5 diverse fibril structures
(i.e., polymorphs) can be formed via different energy transduction pathways during supramolecular organization.6,7 Depending on the species, amyloid peptides/proteins display structural
diversity under certain physicochemical conditions, which is related
to a variety of disease strains and phenotypes. For example, distinct
“daughter” fibril morphologies and neuronal toxicities
of amyloid β (Aβ) associated with Alzheimer’s disease
have been observed through seeding with selective “parent”
seeds, which may have implications for different strains or pathological
manifestations.8 Understanding amyloid
pathways and their possible conformations that could lead to pathogenesis
and degeneration is a vital area of research.

Similar to naturally
occurring proteins, short amyloid fragments
can also exhibit polymorphic β-sheet structures when subtle
structural modifications are applied.9−11 This includes variation
of environmental conditions and changing of amino acid sequences (e.g., single atom replacement of hydrogen to halogen, incorporation
of β-amino acids or aromatic residues, rearrangement of the
hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues).12−21 This is due to the multiple noncovalent interactions involved in
determining a cross-β structure such as hydrogen bonds (H-bonds),
hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic attractions, van der Waals
forces, and π–π interactions.4,5,12,13,22−26 For example, Castelletto et al. showed that the
formation of helical ribbon nanostructures by substitution of the
α-alanine residues with β-alanine in the extended Aβ
variant sequence (AAKLVFF), which was different to the cylindrical
fibrils (KLVFF) or twisted tapes (AAKLVFF) reported in other works.17 Hu et al. reported the important
role of electrostatic repulsions between terminal charges in mediating
the transformation from twisted ribbons into laminated nanobelts.12 Coassembly of oppositely charged amyloid-inspired
peptides into cylindrical nanostructures based on electrostatic attraction
was reported by Cinar and colleagues.25 Liang et al. reported a morphological transition
of Aβ (16–22), Ac-KLVFFAE-NH2, from hollow
nanotubes into fibers following the changes in β-strand registry
at different pH conditions.20 Because amyloid
fragments share similar self-assembly mechanisms with natural proteins,
an investigation of their structural diversities will contribute to
the understanding into amyloid-related biological processes.

In this work, we sought to determine the effect of amino acid sequences
on the self-assembly behavior and fibril morphology of amyloidogenic
peptides derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a 37 amino
acid peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin to regulate the glucose
levels.27,28 The susceptibility to IAPP fibrillation
due to the presence of a hydrophobic core has been implicated in type
II diabetes through the deposition of amyloid plaques.29 Herein, a series of amyloidogenic segments derived
from the 21–29 residues of IAPP (Ac-NNFGAILSS) was designed,
and the structures of amyloid fibrils were systematically characterized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force
microscopy (AFM), Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, and circular
dichroism (CD). By tailoring the amino acid residues at the C-terminal
domain (Ser28, Ser29), which have been shown to determine the fibrillation
of the hydrophobic core sequence (IAPP 20–29 residues),30 we demonstrated the importance of H-bonds and
side chain interactions in regulating peptide fibrillation and stabilizing
distinct amyloid structures. In particular, we presented the formation
of periodically twisted nanoribbons by Ac-NNFGAILSS, where different
sizes of nanoribbons corresponding to the numbers of associated fibrils
were observed. By tailoring the amino acid substitutions and sequence
lengths, polymorphic fibrils were observed in a series of IAPP-derived
fragments, where a correlation between molecular interactions and
fibril helicity was hypothesized to emphasize the role of conformational
constraints. The effects of N-terminal acetylation and sequence elongation
on β-sheet strength, peptide hydrogelation, and fibril morphology
were also studied. We anticipate our findings can help to understand
the sequential determinants toward peptide self-assembly and amyloid
polymorphism.

Results and Discussion
Atomic structures
obtained from the microcrystals of IAPP 21–27
residues (NNFGAIL) revealed a tight main chain interaction between
β-sheet layers.31 This observation
inspired us to investigate the morphological variability of peptides
derived from the amyloidogenic core. We designed eight peptide sequences
by tailoring the terminal residues (i.e., substitution,
elongation, N-terminal capping/uncapping) derived from Ac-NNFGAILSS
(Figure 1a), including
Ac-NNFGAILTT, Ac-NNFGAILAA, Ac-NNFGAILVV, Ac-SSNNFGAIL, Ac-SSNNFGAILSS,
Ac-TTNNFGAILTT, and H-SSNNFGAILSS, and studied the structural polymorphs
of amyloid fibrillation (Figure 1b). Two major morphologies, the twisted and planar
ribbons, were presented by tailoring the amino acid sequences. Polymorphic
structures depending on the number of associated fibrils and β-sheet
stacking that resulted in thin or thick ribbons were also investigated.

Figure 1 (a) Sequence

amyloidogenic core (21–29 residues, Ac-NNFGAILSS). (b) Negative
stained TEM images of the polymorphic amyloid structures including
twisted and planar ribbons of different sizes (left to right: Ac-NNFGAILSS,
Ac-NNFGAILTT, Ac-SSNNFGAILSS, H-SSNNFGAILSS). Scale bar: 50 nm.

As shown in Figure 2a, amyloid fibrils obtained from Ac-NNFGAILSS
exhibited twisted ribbon-like
structures with distinct axial periodicities (pitch: 85–100
nm). The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM image recorded
a high-contrast image of the amyloid fibrils (Figures 2b and S1), where
the strong scattering from the residual salts of the sodium phosphate
buffer “stained” the ribbons and confirmed the diameters
of uranyl acetate-stained fibrils obtained from TEM imaging. AFM topographic
imaging (Figure 2c–e)
revealed that the ribbon thickness was 11.4 nm and the height at the
crossover was 6.4 nm. This agreed with the diameter measured from
TEM imaging, in which the average size of individual fibrils was approximately
5–6 nm (Figure S2). The length of
the Ac-NNFGAILSS peptide was estimated to be approximately 3.4 nm
using PyMOL software. Based on these findings, it was concluded that
an individual fibril consisted of two adjacent β-sheets, with
the hydrophobic inner surfaces packed tightly against each other.

Scale bar: 50 nm.

Ribbon-like structures
in Ac-NNFGAILSS exhibited different sizes
based on the number of associated fibrils (Figure 2f). The smallest peptide ribbon had two fibrils
(n = 2) aligned side-by-side or in a twisted orientation,
with diameters of 10.2 and 11.7 nm, respectively. Most twisted nanoribbons
had a diameter of 14–16 nm, which corresponded to the association
of three fibrils (n = 3). As shown in Figure S3, the nanoribbons exhibited a periodical
spacing of 93.4 nm, which was consistent with the AFM result (Figure 2e). Such large spacing
has frequently been seen when fibrils are loosely coiled, implicating
the flexibility of intersheet interactions.32 Larger ribbons with diameters of 24.4 and 30.2 nm and periodical
spacing of 97.6 and 88.2 nm corresponded to the association of n = 4 and n = 5 fibrils, respectively.

The periodical spacing of these larger ribbons remained at 85–100
nm, which was similar to those of the smaller Ac-NNFGAILSS ribbons
composed primarily of three fibrils. In fact, bundle formation of
β-sheet-forming peptides with finite fibril width and helicity
has been reported to stem from a competition between free energy gain
from attraction between ribbons and penalty due to elastic distortion
from the further growth of intrinsically twisted ribbons.33−35 These suggested that the larger ribbons were formed by bundling
two or more smaller ribbons during the aging process (Figure 3a). In addition, right-handed
helical structures were found in higher-order twisted structures (Figures 2d and 3b); for example, a tilt angle (γ) of n = 5 ribbons was estimated to be 17.7° (Figure 2d). Formation of superhelical structures
resembled the quadruple helix reported by Muraoka et al., in which the helix was composed of two smaller helices, each of
which was composed of two individual fibrils.36 Given that fibril association is a time-dependent and self-propagating
process that forms the final energy-favorable structures,32,37 the growth of Ac-NNFGAILSS fibril was further examined at different
time points. As shown in Figure S4, no
noticeable twisted ribbons were observed within 6 h, whereas elongated
twisted fibrils formed with the increasing aging time. The majority
of twisted ribbons were seen to favor an association of n = 3 fibrils over time, suggesting that this was the most thermodynamically
stable structure for the Ac-NNFGAILSS assembly.

aggregation of twisted Ac-NNFGAILSS ribbons

interwound helices composed by three individual fibrils. (b) Superhelix
consisting of n = 14 fibrils (diameter: 83.0 nm)
with a tilt angle (γ) of 13.7°.

The kinetics of β-sheet formation by Ac-NNFGAILSS was
analyzed
by ThT fluorescence assay, where the sigmoidal-shaped profile was
noted in the process of peptide fibrillation (Figure S5). The role of β-sheets was highlighted through
the addition of high concentration of urea (4 M) to break the H-bonding
networks and weaken the β-sheet structures; this not only reduced
the number of mature Ac-NNFGAILSS ribbons, but they were also less
twisted (Figure S6). The microcrystal structure
of Ac-NNFGAILSS β-sheet structure was obtained by XRD using
a dried aligned stalk that was mounted in parallel with the X-ray
beam. The 2D diffraction pattern showed a strong meridional reflection
at 4.7 Å, which corresponded to the spacing between H-bonded
β-strands within a β-sheet (Figure 4a). The equatorial rings at ∼10 Å
(with two concentric rings at 11.1 and 9.0 Å) and 18.2 Å
corresponded to the short- and long-range intersheet distances, respectively.
Multiple concentric rings (i.e., 9.0 and 11.1 Å)
have been seen in thick amyloid fibers consisting of either two or
more concentric cylindrical β-sheets or two or more single cylindrical
fibers wound around each other.38 This
was in agreement with the varied sizes of Ac-NNFGAILSS nanoribbons
observed by TEM imaging (Figure 2f). The outer and inner diffused rings also supported
the heterogeneity in the fibrillar structure.

and intersheet spacing of 4.7 and 11.1 Å, respectively. (b) CD

CD and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra were used to demonstrate
the molecular details of interstrand and intersheet interactions of
the ribbons. As shown in Figure 4b, the negative and positive maximums at 225 and 206
nm, respectively, suggested a β-sheet structure. The negative
peak was slightly red-shifted from the typical β-sheet absorbance
at 218 nm, which was due to the aromatic interactions during peptide
aggregation.39−42 The FTIR spectrum obtained from freeze-dried peptide fibrils exhibited
strong absorbance at 3285, 2955, and 2875 cm–1,
which corresponded to the N–H stretching, −CH3 antisymmetric, and symmetric stretching, respectively. Characteristic
bands known as the amide I and II regions are located between 1700
and 1500 cm–1, which are mainly due to the C=O
and C–N stretching and N–H bending modes from amide
groups of the peptide structure (Figure S7). The vibrational bands in the range of 1400 to 1300 cm–1 could likely be assigned to the C–N or C–O stretching
and N–H bending modes of the peptide structure.43 In particular, the strongest absorbance at 1628
cm–1 and the absence of 1690 cm–1 in the amide I region (Figure 4c) suggested a parallel β-sheet structure of
the peptide fibrils.44 Other pronounced
vibrational bands displayed in the amide I (1667 and 1600 cm–1) and amide II (1522 and 1516 cm–1) regions confirmed
a distinct β-sheet structure.45 Based
on these results, the 3D structure of the Ac-NNFGAILSS fibril was
depicted using PyMol software (Figure 4d) and was consistent with the parallel, face-to-face
β-sheets of NNFGAIL (21–27 residues)31 and NFGAILS (22–28 residues) or FGAILSS (23–29
residues).46

Interestingly, untwisted
structures (i.e., planar
ribbons) were observed for Ac-NNFGAILTT, where the C-terminal serine
residues (Ser28, Ser29) of the Ac-NNFGAILSS segment were substituted
by threonine. Analyses of TEM (Figure 5a,b) and AFM images (Figures 5c and S8) showed
that the individual Ac-NNFGAILTT ribbon had a diameter of 8–10
nm and thickness of 9.4 nm. To confirm the morphology of Ac-NNFGAILTT
ribbons, the peptide sample was imaged at a perpendicular orientation
to the elongation axis of the ribbons before tilting between ±44°.
As shown in Figure 5d,e, the ribbon thickness was reduced at higher angles, which indicated
the planar ribbons instead of cylindrical structures. Compared to
Ac-NNFGAILSS ribbons (Figure S4), long
and untwisted ribbons of Ac-NNFGAILTT were observed immediately during
the cooling process, showing a pronounced tendency for higher numbers
of associated fibrils (Figure S9). As shown
in Figure 5f, the XRD
pattern showed a similar cross-β structure with the perpendicularly
arranged meridional reflection at 4.7 Å and equatorial rings
at 17.6, 10.8, and 9.1 Å. It was intriguing to find that the
intersheet spacing of Ac-NNFGAILTT ribbons was smaller than the spacing
obtained from Ac-NNFGAILSS (18.2 and 11.1 Å) and suggested the
tighter intersheet contact. Additional rings in the equatorial region
were reflections from higher-order periodicities, indicating that
the Ac-NNFGAILTT ribbons possessed a highly crystallized structure.
These reflection bands were difficult to assign, which was in part
due to overlap with the diffused equatorial reflection from sample
heterogeneity. The FTIR spectrum showed a similar interstrand peptide
stacking as Ac-NNFGAILSS (Figure S10),
in which the strongest absorbance at 1628 cm–1 and
the absence of 1690 cm–1 suggested the parallel
β-sheet structure of the ribbons. CD spectrum showed the β-sheet
structure of Ac-NNFGAILTT ribbons, which exhibited both negative and
positive peaks at 228 and 212 nm, respectively (Figure 5g). The larger red shift (Figure S11a) in the negative absorbance of the CD peak was
observed in Ac-NNFGAILTT compared to Ac-NNFGAILSS (225 nm, Figure 4b), which confirmed
a stronger intersheet aromatic interaction facilitated by the phenylalanine
(Phe23) residue. The stronger β-sheet registry of Ac-NNFGAILTT
was also confirmed by the ThT assay (Figure S11b), which showed an increased fluorescence intensity compared to that
of Ac-NNFGAILSS.

analysis showing the diffraction pattern of the aligned peptide ribbons,

structure. (g) CD spectrum showing the existence of β-sheet
structure in the solution of Ac-NNFGAILTT.

The different morphologies of Ac-NNFGAILTT and Ac-NNFGAILSS
fibrils
were unexpected, given the high structure similarity of serine and
threonine. We speculated that the presence of the methyl group in
threonine of Ac-NNFGAILTT likely caused a restricted conformational
freedom and stronger hydrophobic interactions that balanced the charge
effect at the C-terminus. This was supported by XRD (Figures 4a and 5f) and CD data (Figures 4b and 5g), which suggested a reduced
intersheet spacing and stronger main chain interactions by threonine
substitution. AFM analyses (Figures 2d and S8b) showed an increased
peptide stacking of Ac-NNFGAILTT over Ac-NNFGAILSS in the vertical
direction, with the stronger lamination likely explaining the difficulty
to introduce or maintain twisted structures. It was therefore proposed
that the tighter β-sheet packing favored lateral associations
into planar nanoribbons. The effect of serine and threonine side chains
resulting in different biological products and conformations has been
reported.47−50 For example, studies by Martínez-Sáez and Corzana et al. showed striking differences in the ψs torsion angle depending on the glycosidic linkages with serine or
threonine in the O-linked glycoproteins.47,50 The former gave an alternate conformation (ψs =
−97 or −180°), whereas the latter exhibited a rigid,
eclipsed conformation at ψs = 63 or 120°, which
was explained by the steric repulsion at the methyl group side chain
of threonine.

We then further examined the side chain effects
of the terminal
residues on fibril formation. Peptide sequences with serine substitution
by valine and alanine were synthesized separately, and fibril growth
was performed under the same experimental conditions. ThT assay (Figure 6a) showed the varied
aggregation propensity in the order: Ac-NNFGAILVV > Ac-NNFGAILTT
>
Ac-NNFGAILSS ≥ Ac-NNFGAILAA, which correlated with the twisted/untwisted
morphologies. As proposed above and depicted in Figure 6b, stronger β-sheet registry led to
untwisted ribbons of Ac-NNFGAILVV (Figure 6c) and Ac-NNFGAILTT (Figure 5a), whereas twisted fibrils were formed in
Ac-NNFGAILSS (Figure 2a) and Ac-NNFGAILAA (Figure 6d). In particular, the aggregation propensity as determined
by the ThT assay (Figure 6a) could correlate with the residue hydrophobicity, in which
valine possessed the highest hydrophobicity while serine and alanine
were more hydrophilic.51−53 On the other hand, increased fibril thicknesses were
noted in Ac-NNFGAILTT and Ac-NNFGAILVV, which was due to the enhanced
side group interaction that increased the peptide stacking in the
vertical direction. Compared to Ac-NNFGAILTT, the Ac-NNFGAILVV fibrils
exhibited an enhanced heterogeneity in fibril diameter. This could
be due to the rapid aggregation of Ac-NNFGAILVV upon dissolving in
the buffer and likely pre-existing oligomer seeds during peptide purification
that accelerated the assembly process. The importance of C-terminal
residues was also manifested by Ac-NNFGAIL where the two serine residues
were removed from Ac-NNFGAILSS, and weak β-sheet formation was
observed in this truncated sequence by ThT assay (Figure S12).

and

in the solution of Ac-NNFGAILSS, Ac-NNFGAILTT, Ac-NNFGAILVV, and Ac-NNFGAILAA.
The peptide solutions (1.5 mM) were prepared in the phosphate buffer
(20 mM, pH 7.5) containing 10 μM of ThT. The fluorescence measurements
were performed at ex. 440 nm and em. 485 nm. (b) Schematic view showing
fibril morphologies in relation to the hydrophobicity of amino acids.
TEM images showed the highly aggregated, planar structures in the
solution of Ac-NNFGAILVV (c) and nanoribbons in the solution of Ac-NNFGAILAA
(d), in which twisted structures are indicated by the inset figure
(scale bar: 100 nm).

Extended peptide sequences with additional serine or threonine
residues at the N-terminal region (i.e., Ac-SSNNFGAILSS
and Ac-TTNNFGAILTT) were next synthesized to study the intersheet
molecular interactions and the resulting fibril structure. AFM height
profiles (Figure 7a–d)
showed the thickness of individual fibril was 4.5 and 4.8 nm for Ac-SSNNFGAILSS
and Ac-TTNNFGAILTT, respectively. As confirmed by the ThT assay, the
extended peptides exhibited stronger aggregation propensity and triggered
water gelation due to the strengthened β-sheets (Figure 7d,e). To analyze the hydrogel
properties, rheological studies were performed to determine the storage
modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G′′) at varying frequencies of applied oscillatory stress,
which correspond to the elastic and viscous responses of the peptide
hydrogels, respectively. As shown in Figure S13, G′ was higher than G′′
in Ac-TTNNFGAILTT, indicating the elastic hydrogel formation. In line
with the findings from Figures S4, S6, and 6a, substitution of serine with threonine enhanced
the aggregation propensity of amyloid peptides (Figure S13c,d), leading to a higher value of G′ for Ac-TTNNFGAILTT than Ac-SSNNFGAILSS (Figure S13d).

hydrogelation was noted in the systems of extended peptide sequences
(i.e., Ac-SSNNFGAILSS and Ac-TTNNFGAILTT). The peptide
solutions (5 mM) were aged in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) for
2 days before gel inversion test.

The Ac-TTNNFGAILTT fibrils were untwisted and had a diameter
of
9.8 nm, which was likely a lateral association of two fibrils (Figure S14). Most Ac-SSNNFGAILSS fibrils also
favored an untwisted structure (diameter: 8.5 nm), although some twisted
fibrils were presented (Figure 8a,b). An uncapped peptide (H-SSNNFGAILSS) was prepared to
examine the effect of charge interactions on peptide assembly, in
which the opposite charges eliminated the electrostatic repulsions
at the termini (Figure 8c). FTIR spectra show the parallel β-sheet structure for H-SSNNFGAILSS
and Ac-SSNNFGAILSS (Figure 8d,e). The more defined FTIR peaks at 1540 cm–1 (amide II) and 1632 cm–1 (amide I) with the decreased
absorbance at 1667 cm–1 (amide I) suggested the
stronger order of the uncapped peptide fibrils. As shown by the TEM
images in Figure 8c,
the uncapped peptide boasted a marked difference from the capped sequence
(Figure 8a) by exhibiting
untwisted structures with strong lateral associations (i.e., 4–10 or more associated fibrils). ThT assay showed an enhanced
β-sheet formation of H-SSNNFGAILSS compared to the capped sequence
(Figure 8f), which
is due to the electrostatic attraction between −NH2 and −COOH that promoted peptide self-assembly into large
nanostructures. The role of electrostatic interactions was also confirmed
by adding salt to the Ac-SSNNFGAILSS solution to shield the terminal
charge, in which an enhanced β-sheet formation was observed
in the presence of higher concentrations (50 and 150 mM) of sodium
chloride (NaCl) (Figure S15).

assay showing the different strengths of peptide β-sheet. The
peptide solutions (2 mM) were prepared in the phosphate buffer (20
mM, pH 7.5) containing 10 μM of ThT. The fluorescence measurements
were performed at ex. 440 nm and em. 485 nm.

Finally, the serine residues of Ac-NNFGAILSS were shifted
to the
N-terminal region (Ac-SSNNFGAIL) to examine the effect of terminal
serine residues. As shown in Figure S16, Ac-SSNNFGAIL exhibited a reduced aggregation propensity compared
to Ac-NNFGAILSS, which indicated weaker interactions at Ser19 and
Ser20 compared to the C-terminal serine. This observation was consistent
with previous findings showing the important role of Ser28 to the
fibrillation of IAPP (20–29, SNNFGAILSS) sequence.30

Conclusions
In summary, the fibrillation
behaviors of eight IAPP-derived amyloidogenic
peptides were systematically investigated, where the fibril structures/morphologies
could be rationally tailored by varying the peptide sequences (Table 1). The IAPP 21–29
fragment (Ac-NNFGAILSS) aggregated into twisted ribbon-like structures,
with the resultant diameter correlating with the number of associated
fibrils. The spontaneous association of individual fibrils into larger
twisted ribbons and superhelices was also observed. Increasing the
β-sheet strength or intersheet contacts through additional H-bonds
and/or hydrophobic interactions led to a reduction of torsional strain
in the β-sheet and formation of untwisted planar ribbons. The
ThT assay indicated a correlation between fibril morphology and β-sheet
strength, in which untwisted planar structures displayed a stronger
propensity to form β-sheets. This hypothesis was supported by
amino acid substitution (i.e., serine substitution
by threonine, valine, and alanine), sequence elongation (i.e., additional N-terminal serine and threonine), and terminal capping.
The role of electrostatic interaction toward peptide assembly and
the peptide sequence toward hydrogelation were also addressed. Since
polymorphism is a common feature due to the variable amyloid fibril
assembly pathways, and the fact that a correlation has been drawn
between the fibril assembly/morphology and cellular toxicity,54,55 we believe that our work will provide understanding of the amyloid-derived
peptide self-assembly and the structural basis of amyloid polymorphism.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Fmoc-protected amino acids for peptide synthesis
were purchased from AGTC Bioproducts Ltd. Wang resins were used for
peptide synthesis. Sodium phosphate monobasic (NaH2PO4), sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HPO4), and Thioflavin T were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (UK). Carbon
grid (200 mesh copper) and uranyl acetate solution were purchased
from Electron Microscopy Sciences. Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ.cm)
was used for all the experiments.

Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis
Peptides were synthesized
by standard Fmoc chemistry using Wang resins. Protected amino acids
were added to the growing peptide chain with the activating reagent
2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). Following addition of the N-terminal amino
acid, the Fmoc group was removed under 20% piperidine in DMF deprotection
conditions. The peptides were cleaved by trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/deionized
water (95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v). The crude peptide was precipitated by cold
ether several times, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC, Shimadzu) was applied to obtain the target peptides. The Phenomenex
C18 Gemini NX column was 150 × 21.2 mm and had a 5 μm pore
size and 100 Å particle size.

Matrix-Assisted Desorption/Ionized
Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS)
The purified and lyophilized peptide powders
were dissolved in deionized water/acetonitrile (1:1, 2 mg/mL) and
mixed 1:1 v/v with α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) (8
mg/mL). The mixture was left to dry on the MS holder prior to MS analysis.
MALDI-TOF (Micromass) was performed at reflection mode between 500
and 1800 m/z.

Preparation
of Peptide Fibrils
Peptide powders were
dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) at desired concentrations.
The solutions were heated to 70 °C for 10 min to fully dissolve
the powders before being cooled at room temperature.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy Imaging of Negative Stained
Amyloid Fibrils
For TEM sample preparation, 10 μL of
the aged fibril solution was dropped on a carbon film grid for 5 min,
and the residual liquid was removed with a piece of filter paper.
After that, the TEM grid was stained with 5 μL of 1 wt % uranyl
acetate for 5 min. The excess staining agents were removed with filter
papers. TEM imaging was performed on JEOL 2100F TEM with an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV, and the images were recorded with an Orius camera.
The fibril diameters, twist spacing, and twist angles were estimated
from at least four measurements using ImageJ, depending on the fibril
morphologies.

High-Resolution TEM/STEM Imaging of Unstained
Amyloid Fibrils
TEM samples were prepared by dropping 10
μL of the aged fibril
solution on an ultrathin carbon holey grid (400 mesh copper, Electron
Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min, and the excess liquid was removed
with filter paper. Electron microscopy characterizations of the unstained
amyloid fibrils were performed on a Philips CM300 TEM at 300 kV and
a Cs-corrected TEAM 0.5 TEM/STEM at 50 kV using a HAADF detector,
which resulted in Z-contrast images.

X-ray Diffraction
Peptide solutions (25 mM) were prepared
in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) and aged for at least 2 days prior
to XRD sample preparation. The aged solution (10 μL) was dropped
and suspended between two waxed stalks spaced around 2 cm. The droplet
was left to dry at room temperature for at least 24 h. The diffraction
pattern was collected at the Advanced Light Source Beamline 8.3.1
(λ = 1.12709 Å) with a Pilatus 6 M detector. Exposure times
were 1.00 s with a 1.00° rotation at specimen-to detector distances
of 350 mm. The 2D diffraction images were radially integrated into
a 1D pattern by Nika 2D SAS software package for Igor Pro.56

Atomic Force Microscopy Imaging
For AFM sample preparation,
5–10 μL of the aged fibril solution was dropped on an
oxygen plasma-treated silicon wafer (about 1 cm × 1 cm) for 5
min. The residual liquid was removed. AFM imaging was performed on
a 5500 Microscope (Keysight Technologies, previously Agilent) in tapping
mode in air. A HQ:NSC15/Al BS tip (μmasch) was applied for the
topography imaging (tip radius of 8 nm, resonance frequency of 325
kHz, force constant of 40 N m–1).

Circular Dichroism
Peptide solutions were prepared
in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) and aged for at least 2 days prior
to CD analyses. The samples were loaded in a 0.01 cm quartz cell,
and CD measurement was performed with a Jasco-715 spectrometer, with
the scanning speed of 100 nm/min, resolution of 2 nm, data pitch of
0.1 nm, accumulation time of 2, and response time of 4 s. The data
unit was converted from machine units (millidegree, θ) into
molar ellipticity [θ] using the equation  where P is the path length
in centimeters and conc. is the molar concentration
of the peptide samples.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The IR spectra
of the fibril powders were obtained on FTIR spectrometry (Shimadzu)
in attenuated total reflection mode, with the wavenumber scanned between
4000 and 650 cm–1, response time of 8 s, and step
of 1 cm–1.

Thioflavin T Assay
To determine the critical aggregation
concentration, different concentrations of peptide solutions were
incubated with 10 μM of ThT in 384-well plates. The plate was
left for at least 12 h at room temperature in the dark before fluorescence
measurement. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer Enspire
plate reader and SpectraMax M5 multimode microplate reader (Molecular
Devices Ltd.) for Figure 7, with an excitation wavelength at 440 nm and emission between
455 and 700 nm. For measuring the kinetics of ThT fluorescence, peptide
solutions (2 mM) were prepared in the phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH
7.5) containing 10 μM of ThT in 384-well plates prior to fluorescence
measurement (ex. 440 nm, em. 485 nm).

Rheology
Peptide
solutions (10 mM) were aged in phosphate
buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) for at least 2 days prior to the rheological
measurement. Rheological properties were assessed using an Advanced
Rheometer AR2000ex with AR Instrument Software (TA Instruments) fitted
with a Peltier temperature control system. Oscillatory parallel plate
rheological measurements were made at 25 °C using a 10 mm diameter
steel plate with a 500 μm gap distance in the initial setup.
The dynamic moduli of the peptide gels were obtained by measuring
the G′ and G″ as a
function of controlled angular frequency in the range from 0.1 to
50 rad/s, with a constant strain value of 0.1%.
