Biofunctionalized
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) enable innovative
translational research and development in biomedicine. Biomolecules
such as peptides, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates can be assembled
onto AuNPs to yield nanomaterials with unique properties for applications
in imaging, photothermal therapy, vaccination strategies, and drug
delivery. The characterization of functionalized AuNPs still remains
an analytical challenge that normally requires the combination of
multiple techniques. Laser desorption/ionization (LDI) and matrix-assisted
LDI (MALDI) have been applied successfully in combination with time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for the analysis of the surface chemistry
of AuNPs functionalized with synthetic ligands, however only for ligands
with a molecular mass limited to 1000 Da. TOF-MS-based approaches
in addition exhibit limited performance in terms of mass resolution
and MS/MS possibilities. To overcome these limitations, we designed
an approach for the analysis of AuNPs based on ultrahigh resolution
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS and a combination
of LDI and MALDI. To illustrate the performance of the method, we
present a comprehensive characterization of the surface chemistry
of AuNPs conjugated via a thiol-ending linker to
either the ovalbumin peptide (OVA 323-339), the Lewis X antigen (Galβ1-4[Fucα1-3]GlcNAcβ1)
trisaccharide, the tetramannoside Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-3Manα1,
or a mixture of both carbohydrates. Collision-induced dissociation
(CID) was used to characterize the structure of pseudomolecular ions
generated by LDI/MALDI in-depth. These included [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+, and importantly also [M + Au]+ and [M + 2Au–H]+ ions. This first observation
of gold-containing pseudomolecular ions provides direct evidence for
the Au-conjugation of ligands. In addition, we show the applicability
of the method to monitor proteolytic cleavage of peptides that are
conjugated to the AuNP surface. The presented LDI/MALDI–FTICR–MS
and MS/MS approach will be applicable to the characterization of a
wide range of functionalized AuNPs.

Gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) are
versatile nanomaterials with a vast field of applications.1,2 The possibility to tailor specific biological, physical, and chemical
properties through particle size and via surface
modification makes AuNPs one of the most promising and studied tools
in nanotechnology-enabled biomedicine. AuNPs display a high adsorption
capacity due to a large surface-to-volume ratio, they are relatively
nontoxic, can be functionalized with a variety of biomolecules, and
they strongly interact with light by a physical phenomenon called
surface plasmon resonance. These characteristics have stimulated the
exploration of AuNPs in medical applications including imaging, photothermal
therapy, vaccination, and drug delivery.3−6 Development of functional nanoparticles
that carry multiple (bio)molecules will further extend the field of
(biomedical) applications.2

AuNPs
in the 2–100 nm size range are typically synthesized
in solution by redox reactions and can be functionalized by introducing
molecules containing a thiol group to form a strong nanoparticle–sulfur
bond.7,8 Structure characterization of the surface
of nanomaterials with regard to conjugation chemistry, ligand definition,
and overall quality control is a key-factor in the development of
functionalized AuNPs. A suitable method for the characterization of
AuNPs must provide reliable information on the composition
of the AuNP surface with respect to ligand structure, density, and
stoichiometry. Analytical techniques should also allow the detection
of possible modifications induced by the exposure to enzymes and other
reactants in a biological environment such as the bloodstream or target
organs. Clearly, characterization of biofunctional AuNPs is challenging,
and may require a multimethod approach, including complementary analytical
techniques such as UV–vis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry
(MS).9

MS has proved to be a powerful
tool for the characterization of
functionalized AuNPs by providing information with regard to the mass
of the ligands.10 While ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS
have been used for the characterization of gold nanoclusters,11,12 laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS has been successfully applied
in the mass analysis of various AuNPs ligands;10,13−16 however, only small synthetic ligands (i.e., <1000 Da) could
be analyzed.17 This limitation is caused
by a low desorption/ionization efficiency of specific ligands in commercial
matrix assisted LDI-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) platforms and a decreased
sensitivity of TOF mass analyzers at higher m/z. The combination of LDI–MS with MALDI allowed an
enhancement of the detection of the ligands of AuNPs in biological
samples.18 LDI/MALDI methods rely on the
fact that AuNPs absorb laser irradiation resulting in the release
and ionization of ligands that are subsequently detected by MS. For
many applications, mass measurements by LDI/MALDI–MS and tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) may be required for full structural identification
of complex ligands such as lipids, peptides, and carbohydrates which
are of interest for biomedical applications and often have a mass
higher than 1000 Da. Unfortunately, LDI/MALDI–MS analyses on
AuNPs have hitherto been performed on time-of-flight (TOF) MS instruments
with limited MS/MS possibilities.

To overcome the limitations
of LDI-TOF–MS instruments with
respect to mass range, mass resolution, accuracy, and MS/MS possibilities
for the comprehensive analysis of biomolecular functionalization of
AuNPs, we here apply ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance (FTICR) MS and a combination of LDI and MALDI. FTICR MS
provides the highest resolving power, mass accuracy, and precision
among the different mass analyzers and provides a higher dynamic range
than TOF-MS.19,20 To illustrate the applicability
of the FTICR MS method, we characterize ∼2 nm AuNPs conjugated via a thiol-ending linker to either the ovalbumin peptide
(OVA 323-339), the Lewis X antigen (Galβ1-4[Fucα1-3]GlcNAcβ1)
trisaccharide, the tetramannoside Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-3Manα1,
or both carbohydrates. In addition, LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS using
1,5-diaminonaphthalene (1,5-DAN) as a matrix and collision-induced
dissociation (CID) fragmentation studies on pseudomolecular ions,
such as [M + H]+, [M + Au]+, and [M + 2Au–H]+, allowed unequivocal proof of attachment and composition
of ligands to the AuNP surface.

Results and Discussion
OVA 323-339
peptide, Lewis X, and Tetramannoside AuNPs
Peptide- and carbohydrate-functionalized
AuNPs find increased application
in various biomedical research areas.21 For the current study, we synthesized AuNPs conjugated to the immunogenic
OVA 323-339 peptide, and two different carbohydrate-coupled AuNPs.
The OVA peptide was previously explored in the context of AuNPs as
a T-cell epitope-containing carrier for immunization with S. pneumonia antigens.22 Carbohydrate
AuNPs were constructed of a tetramannoside, recently also used to
mimic HIV gp120 oligomannose clusters,23,24 and of the
immunomodulatory Lewis X antigen.25 In
each case a relatively long bifunctional thiol-ending linker (i.e.,
SCN-TEG-C11-SH) was used to couple the functional carbohydrate ligand
through a thiourea bond as previously described.26 A glucose thiol-ending short derivative (i.e., -C5-SH)
was used to modulate the density of the functional carbohydrate ligands
on the AuNPs while still allowing them to protrude from the AuNP surface.
A schematic of the AuNPs used in this study is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Gold nanoparticles characterized
in this study. AuNPs were all
functionalized with glucose-based ligands (indicated with solid blue
circles) and in addition with various ligands (one-pot procedure described
in Methods). Four different types of AuNPs
were obtained: (A) AuNP functionalized with an ovalbumin (OVA 323-339)
peptide-based ligand; (B) AuNP functionalized with a Lewis X ligand;
(C) AuNP functionalized with a tetramannoside ligand; (D) AuNP functionalized
with both Lewis X and tetramannoside ligands.

Analysis of OVA 323-339 peptide AuNPs by LDI-, LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS and MS/MS
In this study, we aimed to analyze AuNPs functionalized
with biomolecules with a mass larger than 1000 Da. First, AuNPs of
∼2 nm conjugated to a modified OVA 323-339 peptide (monoisotopic
mass = 1917.912 Da) were analyzed by both LDI- and LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS. As depicted in Figure 2A, LDI results in a pseudomolecular ion of the OVA peptide
ligand ([M + Na]+), implying a release from the surface
of the AuNPs upon ionization. In combination with the 1,5-DAN matrix
(Figure 2B) the spectrum
changes dramatically: the OVA peptide ligand is now observed as a
protonated pseudomolecular ion at m/z 1918.933 at a peak intensity about 80 times higher compared to LDI.
The 1,5-DAN MALDI matrix exhibits a high hydrogen donor capacity which
in general enhances the signal compared to LDI-measurements (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). LDI-TOF MS
did not yield any ions of the OVA peptide ligand, whereas LDI/MALDI-TOF
MS resulted in a low quality spectrum compared to LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS. Thus, we conclude that the mass limitation of 1000 Da reported
earlier by Vachet and co-workers17 can
be overcome by LDI/MALDI-TOF MS, however for confident characterizations
LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS which offers superior mass resolution and
fragmentation capacity is required.

Figure 2 Relevant parts of the FTICR mass spectra
of AuNPs with OVA 323-339
peptide-based ligand obtained from LDI only (A) and LDI/MALDI (B).
The use of 1,5-DAN as a MALDI matrix resulted in the detection of
pseudomolecular ions [M + H]+, [M + Au]+, and
[M + 2Au–H]+, highlighted with three different colors.
Additional pseudomolecular ions observed were (a) [M–S–H
+ 1,5-DAN]+ at m/z 2043.030,
(b) [M–H + 1,5-DAN]+ at m/z 2074.998, and (c) pseudomolecular ion of coupled glucose-based
and OVA-based ligands at m/z 2199.038
(as explained in the Results and Discussion section). Further structure characterization of [M + Au]+, [M + H]+, and [M + 2Au–H]+ was performed
by collision-induced dissociation (CID) and as an example the tandem
mass spectrum of the first species is shown in C (the other two can
be found in Figure S2). The obtained high
sequence coverages (D) allowed to determine the preferred coordination
site(s) of Au+ by evaluating all gold-containing fragment
ions (indicated with yellow circles).

Interestingly, LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS allowed the detection
of the OVA peptide ligand as [M + Au]+ and [M + 2Au–H]+ at m/z 2114.892 and m/z 2310.859, respectively (Figure 2B). To our knowledge, although
Au+ ions have been detected in LDI spectra of AuNPs,18,27 the generation of gold-cluster ions linked to the ligands of functionalized
AuNPs by LDI-MS has never been reported. Upon using AuCl3 in combination with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, gold ion-angiotensin
peptide complexes (i.e., [M + Au(I)]+ and [M + 2Au(I)–H]+) have been observed in MALDI-spectra, with preferred coordination
sites for gold being Cys, His, and Arg as determined from tandem-MS
analysis.28 In our study, no single Au+ ions or Au+ clusters were detected and both the
synthesis protocol (i.e., using 21 equiv of reducing agent) and the
purification procedures (i.e., extensive dialysis) rule out the presence
of free Au+ in solution. Thus, we rationalize that the
observed [M + Au]+ and [M + 2Au–H]+ species
result from a detachment of ligands together with Au+ ions
from the nanoparticle surface.

An advantage of LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS, essential to the analysis
of AuNPs with complex ligands, is the possibility of combining accurate
ion mass determination with tandem mass spectrometry, using, for example,
CID. The MS/MS spectra with assignments of the [M + Au]+, and [M + H]+and [M + 2Au–H]+ species
of the OVA peptide-based ligand are depicted in Figure 2C and Figure S2, respectively. The CID of [M + H]+ resulted in fragments
representing nearly all peptide bond cleavages (sequence coverage
94%, Figure S2B), fully confirming the
OVA 323-339 amino acid sequence. In general, for this species, b-type
fragmentation was favorable compared to y-type (a scheme of b- and
y-type fragmentation is reported in Figure S3), although the most abundant fragment ion was a y-type ion detected
at m/z 659.347 generated from the
cleavage between Glu11 and Ile12. Full sequence coverage was obtained
for [M + Au]+ (Figure 2D) and, as for [M + H]+, the most abundant
CID fragment was the protonated y-type ion detected at m/z 659.347 (cleavage at Glu11-Ile12) suggesting
that Au+ is not localized on the C-terminal part of the
peptide. The detection of both protonated (more abundant) and gold-linked
(less abundant) fragment ions for the same fragmentation site did
not allow an unambiguous localization of Au+. However,
the data indicate that both the terminal sulfur and His9 are preferred
coordination sites of Au+. The MS/MS analysis of [M + 2Au–H]+ (Figure S2C,D) showed that the
fragmentation between Glu11 and Ile12 was not predominant and while
y-type ions carried one Au+ (main species), b-type ions
carried two gold atoms. This suggests that both His6 and the terminal
sulfur atom are involved in the coordination of Au+. Internal
fragmentation (see inset Supporting Information, Figure S2C) resulted in low-intensity fragment ions containing
His6 and gold. These data obtained for [M + Au]+ and [M
+ 2Au–H]+ species are indicative of the affinity
of His6 and His9 for Au+ in the gas phase only, since the
structure of b- and y-type fragments is an important factor for the
coordination of cations. In contrast, on the surface of AuNPs a gold–histidine
bond is energetically unfavorable compared to the strong gold–sulfur
bond. In fact, Aldeek et al. have shown that proteins
expressing an N-terminus polyhistidine tag self-assembled onto AuNPs
only when NPs were partially capped with thiol-terminated ligands
or were stabilized with a weakly binding cap such as citrate groups.29

As previously reported, LDI of AuNPs functionalized
through an
Au–S bond can lead to loss of SH2 from the ligand
resulting in the formation of a double bond between adjacent carbons.13,18 As depicted in the inset in Figure 2B, this loss was observed at m/z 1884.945. In addition, due to the high hydrogen-donor
capacity of the 1,5-DAN matrix, the reduced form [M–S + H]+ of [M–SH2 + H]+ was detected
at m/z 1886.960. The structural
characterization of these species by CID allowed confirmation of the
presence/absence of a double bond in the structure of the linker (Supporting Information, Figure S4).

The
OVA peptide AuNPs were synthesized using the glucose ligand
and the OVA peptide ligand at a concentration ratio of about 9:1.
The glucose ligand (theoretical m/z 282.1137) was hardly detected by both LDI- and LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS. Interestingly, the coupled glucose- and OVA peptide-ligand attached
to each other via an S–S bond was detected
at m/z 2199.038 (Figure 2B). Earlier, Yan et
al. reported the formation of S–S bonds between ligands
from monolayer-protected AuNPs induced by LDI.13 The CID spectrum of the glucose-OVA peptide species is
reported in Figure S5. The most abundant
fragment ions were b-type ions generated after the loss of the glucose
molecule (i.e., fragment ion at m/z 2037.000), which is in line with the well-known lability of glycosidic
bonds in CID of protonated glycoconjugates.30 In-source decay of the OVA peptide ligand was observed in both LDI-
and LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS analyses. Preliminary data suggest that
the use of sinapinic acid as the MALDI matrix instead of 1,5-DAN can
drastically reduce in-source decay (Figure S6).

The detection of different forms of the OVA peptide ligand
shows
the potential of our strategy for the analysis of ligands with molecular
weight higher than 1000 Da. In our previous study, we have shown that
MALDI–FTICR MS allows the measurements at isotopic resolution
of proteins up to about m/z 17 000.31 From this, we rationalize that the analysis
of proteins linked to AuNPs is limited to similar sizes.

It
is known from surface plasmon resonance studies that AuNPs with
different particle sizes have different light absorption properties
(e.g., from a laser). The here reported strategies apply to AuNPs
with a diameter of approximately 2 nm. An additional and independent
evaluation would be needed in case larger particles were of interest,
or other metal or metal oxide were considered.

Enzymatic Digestion of
OVA Peptide AuNPs and LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS
In situ activation of AuNPs, for example
by the proteolytic cleavage of bioactive peptides or enzymatic release
of fluorescent molecules for visualization allows innovative applications
of AuNPs in biomedicine.32,33 Therefore, it is essential
to develop MS-methods for the characterization of biofunctionalized
AuNPs after modification or activation, providing information about
the changes of surface chemistry and composition. Here, we studied
the surface chemistry of the OVA peptide AuNPs after enzymatic digestion.
To this end, the OVA peptide AuNPs were partially digested using endoproteinase
Glu-C and then characterized by LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS and MS/MS.
The undigested intact OVA peptide ligand was observed at m/z 1918.949 as major species in the spectrum (Figure 3B). The OVA peptide
contains two theoretical cleavage sites at Glu11 and Glu14 (Figure 3A). The shorter OVA
peptide ligand generated from the cleavage at Glu11 ([M1 + H]+ in Figure 3B) was detected at m/z 1278.607
while the ligand generated from the cleavage at Glu14 and missed cleavage
at Glu11 ([M2 + H]+ in Figure 3B) was detected at m/z 1634.786 at lower peak intensity. As for the intact OVA
peptide ligand, also the shorter M1 peptide was detected
bound to one or two Au+, the glucose ligand and the 1,5
DAN matrix. The species generated from the loss of either SH2 or S were also detected. The MS/MS spectra and sequence coverage
generated from the analysis of [M1 + H]+, [M1 + Au]+, and [M1 + 2Au–H]+ are reported in Supporting Information Figure S7, and Figure 3. While b-type fragmentation was preferred for [M1 + H]+, y-type fragments were more abundant for the gold-complexed
species. The characterization of [M1 + Au]+ suggests
that Au+ is coordinated at His6 while the second Au+ of [M1 + 2Au–H]+ is localized
on the terminal sulfur of the linker. CID analysis also confirmed
the structure of the M1 ligand linked to the glucose ligand via an S–S bond detected at m/z 1558.715 (Supporting Information Figure S7).

MS spectrum after Glu-C digestion. The most abundant product is derived
from the cleavage at Glu11 and was detected as [M1 + H]+ at m/z 1278.607, [M1 + Au]+ at m/z 1474.571 and [M1 + 2Au–H]+ at m/z 1670.536. A second product is derived
from the cleavage at Glu14 (with a missed cleavage at Glu11) and was
detected as [M2 + H]+ at m/z 1634.786. Other assignments are (a)[M1–S–H + 1,5-DAN]+ at m/z 1402.703. (b)[M–S–H + 1,5-DAN]+ at m/z 2043.052. (c)[M1–H + glucose ligand]+ at m/z 1558.715. (d)[M–H
+ glucose ligand]+ at m/z 2199.038. (C) Sequence coverage obtained from CID analysis of [M1 + Au]+ (mass spectra of [M1 + H]+, [M1 + Au]+, and [M1 + 2Au–H]+ are shown in Figure S7). The data
suggests that the preferred coordination sites of Au+ are
Histidine 6 and the terminal sulfur. Yellow circles = [fragment +
Au]+. Double yellow circles = [fragment + 2Au–H]+.

Together these data confirm the
successful proteolysis by Glu-C
of the OVA peptide at the surface of the AuNPs and show the potential
of this method for monitoring of in vitro or in vivo ligand modifications. Our strategy allowed to detect
enzymatic modifications of the AuNPs on the particles themselves in
contrast to the detection of cleavage products, released from the
particles.

Analysis of Lewis X and Tetramannoside AuNPs
by LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS and MS/MS
AuNPs functionalized with two different carbohydrate
ligands were analyzed by LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS, namely the Lewis
X ligand (monoisotopic mass = 993.4749 Da) and the tetramannoside
ligand (monoisotopic mass = 1130.4961 Da). The LDI/MALDI–FTICR
spectrum of Lewis X AuNPs is reported in Figure 4. Here, the most abundant species detected
at m/z 982.484 was identified as
[M–SH2 + Na]+. MS/MS analysis (Supporting Information, Figure S8) confirmed
the loss of SH2 generated from the terminal thiol group
of the linker (Figure 4B). Interestingly, a double loss of SH2 was observed at m/z 948.495. This double loss generated
from both the terminal thiol group and the thiourea group of the linker.
These losses were not observed in the MALDI–FTICR–MS
analysis of the purified Lewis X ligand (i.e., not linked to AuNPs; Supporting Information, Figure S9) which indicates
that the sulfur at the thiourea group may also form a bond with gold.
Contrary to what was observed for the OVA peptide, the [M–S
+ Na]+ was not detected. In-source decay of [M–SH2 + Na]+ led to the loss of fucose from the carbohydrate
moiety (i.e., species detected at m/z 836.424).

Figure 4 (A) LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS spectrum of AuNP functionalized with
Lewis X-based ligand. The use of NaCl in the spotting procedure led
to the detection of the intact Lewis X ligand at low intensity as
[M + H]+, [M + Na]+, and [M + Au]+, and the detection of fragmented species at higher intensity such
as [M–SH2 + Na]+ and [M–SH2–Fuc + Na]+. (B) From structural characterization
performed by CID a double bond resulting from the loss of SH2 was confirmed. Furthermore, MS/MS data of three different pseudomolecular
ions provided structure confirmation of the Lewis X-based ligand.
The analysis of the [M + Au]+ suggests the terminal sulfur
as the preferred coordination site of Au+. Yellow circles
indicate gold-linked fragment ions.

Fragmentation of carbohydrates by CID provides detailed structural
information from glycosidic linkage cleavages as well as cross-ring
cleavages.34 The CID spectra from Lewis
X and tetramannoside ligands were evaluated based on the identification
of glycosidic cleavages. The characterization of [M + Na]+, [M + H]+ [M + Au]+ by CID resulted in different
fragmentation patterns (Supporting Information Figure S8 and Figure 4) and provided complementary information on the structure of the
ligand. In fact, the larger ion generated from the fragmentation of
the Gal(β1-4)-GlcNAc bond was only detected in the MS/MS spectrum
of [M + Au]+ at m/z 882
and not in the MS/MS spectra of [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+. Other examples of fragment ions providing complementary
information are those detected in the CID spectrum of [M + H]+ at m/z 465 and 512 and
those in the spectrum of [M + Na]+ at m/z 595 and 637. The presence of gold-clustered fragments
indicated that Au+ was not localized on the carbohydrate
part but rather in the proximity of the terminal sulfur of the linker.
Further evidence for this localization was provided by the detection
of the gold-clustered fragment at m/z 576. The species detected at m/z 1000.494 was identified as a Lewis X ligand with urea instead of
a thiourea in the structure of the linker.

The LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS analysis of the tetramannoside AuNPs
led to the detection of ion species similar to those detected for
the Lewis X AuNPs (see Figures 4 and 5). Also in this case, the most
abundant peak in the spectrum was identified as [M–SH2 + Na]+. The fragmentation patterns of [M + Na]+ and [M + Au]+ were clearly different with [M + Na]+ providing more information on the structure of the linker
(i.e., fragments at m/z 444, 774,
and 732) while [M + Au]+ provided more information on the
structure on the carbohydrate part (i.e., fragments at m/z 841, 1003, 1165) (Figure 5B). The detection of gold-clustered fragments
indicates that the Au+ is localized on the terminal sulfur
of the linker (Supporting Information Figure
S10 and Figure 5B).
As for the Lewis X AuNPs, the detection of the fragment at m/z 576 in the MS/MS spectrum of [M + Au]+ provided additional evidence for this localization. Interestingly,
when NaCl was not used in combination with the 1,5-DAN matrix, the
tetramannoside ligand was detected at high intensity as [M + H]+, [M + Au]+, and [M + 2Au–H]+ (Supporting Information Figure S11).

Figure 5 (A) LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS spectrum of AuNP functionalized with
tetramannoside-based ligand. The tetramannoside-based ligand was detected
as [M + H]+, and [M + Au]+ at low intensity,
and detected as [M + Na]+, [M–SH2 + Na]+ and [M–S + O + Na]+ at higher intensities.
(B) Structure characterization performed by CID confirmed the identity
of these species. Fragmentation of [M + Au]+ allowed characterization
of the carbohydrate moiety of the ligand, whereas CID analysis of
[M + Na]+ provided more information on the structure of
the linker. Yellow circles indicate gold-linked fragment ions.

To explore the applicability of
LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS for the
analysis of AuNPs with mixed functional ligands, we analyzed AuNPs
carrying both Lewis X and tetramannoside. The ligand ratio anticipated
on the basis of reaction stoichiometry and measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy was approximately 1:2, and the ratio between these
ligands as detected by LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS and determined as
([M1–SH2 + Na]+ + [M1–S + O + Na]+ + [M1 + Na]+)/ ([M2–SH2 + Na]+ + [M2-S + O + Na]+ + [M2 + Na]+) was ∼3.0 (see Figure 6 and Figures S13–S15). Although
it is clear that these results may be biased due to different ionization
efficiencies for the different ligand species, it shows the potential
of this approach to determine ligand ratios after synthesis of multicomponent
AuNPs or for example after dynamic covalent exchange, as previously
reported using LDI-MS-based methods.13,14

Conclusions
We
performed detailed structural characterization of peptide and
carbohydrate functionalized AuNPs of ∼2 nm using a combination
of LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS and CID. The here described strategy
allows the structural analysis of AuNPs with ligands larger than 1000
Da by generating spectra of a much higher quality than spectra obtained
with previously described LDI-TOF MS methods, including fragmentation
spectra. All analyzed AuNPs were functionalized with either the OVA
323-339 peptide, the Lewis X antigen, or the tetramannoside, or a
combination of the latter two ligands. The MS analysis of these AuNPs
allowed for the detection of the ligands as pseudomolecular species,
such as [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + Au]+, and [M + 2Au–H]+ and the detection of modified
ligands, such as [M–SH2 + Na]+, which
were formed during ionization. We showed that LDI/MALDI-CID-FTICR
MS allows for the in-depth structural characterization of these species
providing comprehensive information on the surface chemistry of biofunctionalized
AuNPs. In fact, MS/MS analysis allowed identification of the ligands
present on the surface of AuNPs and an understanding of how these
ligands can be linked to or interact with gold atoms. The identification
and characterization of different [M + nAu]+ species could be used, in general, to confirm AuNP surface attachment
of thiol coupled ligands. To our knowledge, the generation of these
gold-containing ions directly from AuNPs has never been reported.

In addition, using the endoproteinase Glu-C, we showed that the
OVA peptide AuNPs can be enzymatically modified and that surface modifications
can be monitored by LDI/MALDI–FTICR MS, further indicating
the potential of the approach in the field of AuNP research and development.

Methods
Conjugation of AuNPs with
OVA Peptide, Lewis X Antigen and Tetramannoside
Four different
types of AuNPs functionalized with thiol-ending
derivatives of OVA 323-339 peptide, Lewis X, and tetramannoside were
prepared as previously described (Figure 1).22,26 For each AuNP a thiol-ending
derivative of glucose (i.e., 5-(mercapto)pentyl β-d-glucopyranoside) was used as the inner component to allow the incorporation
of defined proportions of ligands, controlling their loading on the
AuNPs (i.e., 10% of total surface load). To this
end, a 9:1 mixture of inner component-ligand was used for the synthesis.
Thus, AuNPs were functionalized with a thiol-ending conjugate of either
a tetramannoside (Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-3Manα)
or a Galβ1-4[Fucα1-3]GlcNAcβ1 (Lewis X antigen)
or a 1:2 mixture of the two carbohydrates (i.e., ligands), as previously
described.22,26,35 The OVA 323-339 peptide with an additional glycine and mercapto-propionic
acid linker at the N-terminus HS(CH2)2C(O)GISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR was obtained from GenScript
Corp (Piscataway, NJ, USA,); AuNPs carrying 10% of OVA 323-339 peptide
and 90% of inner component were prepared as previously described.22 Briefly, a water solution of tetrachloroauric
acid (HAuCl4, Strem Chemicals, 0.025 M, 1 equiv) was added
to a 0.012 M (3 equiv) MeOH solution of the mixture of 10% thiol-ending
conjugates and 90% of glucose-conjugate. A solution of NaBH4 1 M (21 equiv) was then added, and the black suspension was shaken
for 2 h at room temperature. Thus, obtained AuNPs were washed with
EtOH and MeOH, dissolved in a minimal volume of nanopure water and
purified by dialysis (3500 Da MWCO), 5 times with 5 L during 72 h.
Transmission electron microscopy showed a mean gold core diameter
of approximately 2 nm for all the prepared AuNPs. Detailed experimental
conditions for the synthesis of each NP and supporting structural
information are reported in Supporting Information pages S13–S15. For the analysis of the ligand ratio on the
AuNPs, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was used
as previously described.22,36 Before MALDI–FTICR–MS
analysis AuNPs were washed with nanopure water (3 times with 500 μL)
on 30 kDa centrifugal filters and AuNPs were suspended in nanopure
water to a final concentration of 1–2 mg/mL.

Enzymatic Digestion
of OVA Peptide AuNPs
Endoproteinase
Glu-C with enzymatic activity ≥ 15 units/mg protein was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. This solution was diluted 1 to 1000 in water,
and 1 μL was mixed with 10 μL of 1 mg/mL solution of OVA
323-339 AuNPs. This mixture was then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C.
Digested OVA 323-339 AuNPs were analyzed by MS without any further
purification.

LDI and MALDI Spotting
For LDI analysis,
each solution
of functionalized AuNPs was spotted (1 μL) onto a ground-steel
MALDI-target plate either undiluted or after a 1:10 dilution with
solution A (50% ACN, 49.95% water, and 0.05% formic acid). For LDI/MALDI
analysis, 1 μL of the same solutions was spotted onto a ground-steel
MALDI-target together with a saturated solution of either 1,5 diaminonaphthalene
(1,5-DAN) or sinapinic acid (SA), both prepared in solution A. One
microliter of a NaCl solution at 1 mg/mL was mixed on the MALDI-target
plate with each AuNPs solution and MALDI matrixes.

LDI- and LDI/MALDI–FTICR
MS and MS/MS
All LDI-
and LDI/MALDI-ESI-FTICR MS experiments were performed on a 15T solariX
XR FTICR mass spectrometer controlled by ftmsControl software and
equipped with a CombiSource and a ParaCell (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany). A Bruker Smartbeam-II Laser System was used for irradiation
at a frequency of 500 Hz using the “medium” predefined
shot pattern. The instrumental parameters were tuned for optimal sensitivity
in the m/z-ranges between 92 and
5000 and 966.1–5000. The number of laser shots, laser power,
and number of acquired scans were optimized for each type of functionalized
AuNP. MALDI–FTICR spectra were generated with 1 M data points.
Precursor ions were isolated through a quadrupole (Q), accumulated
in the hexapole collision cell, and fragmented by collision-induced
dissociation (CID). Accumulation times and collision energies were
optimized for each precursor ion. DataAnalysis Software 4.2 (Bruker
Daltonics) was used for the visualization and data analysis of both
LDI- and LDI/MALDI-(CID)-FTICR spectra.
