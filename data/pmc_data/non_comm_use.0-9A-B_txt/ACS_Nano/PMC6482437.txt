Aberration-corrected
transmission electron microscopy of the atomic
structure of diamond–graphite interface after Ni-induced catalytic
transformation reveals graphitic planes bound covalently to the diamond
in the upright orientation. The covalent attachment, together with
a significant volume expansion of graphite transformed from diamond,
gives rise to uniaxial stress that is released through plastic deformation.
We propose a comprehensive model explaining the Ni-mediated transformation
of diamond to graphite and covalent bonding at the interface as well
as the mechanism of relaxation of uniaxial stress. We also explain
the mechanism of electrical transport through the graphitized surface
of diamond. The result may thus provide a foundation for the catalytically
driven formation of graphene–diamond nanodevices.

==== Body
The magic
of carbon as an element
lies in its ability to hybridize the electronic orbitals in diverse
configurations. Thereby, carbon can form covalent structures in one
dimension (carbyne), two dimensions (graphene), and three dimensions
(diamond).1 Importantly, the diamond and
graphene crystals differ in their electronic structure: the electronic
energy band gap of ∼ 5.5 eV for diamond versus the 0 eV band
gap of graphene raises interest for various applications. Placing
graphene on a diamond surface can result in electronic devices exhibiting
superior performance due to nonexisting electronic contamination in
the all-carbon environment.2 However, the
production of such devices remains a challenge.

It has been
reported that a direct graphitization of the single-crystal
(111) diamond surface at temperatures >1373 K yields several layers
of graphene formed parallel to the diamond surface.3 To reduce the high temperatures of graphitization, the
use of metal catalysts has been explored. Ni has been conventionally
used as a catalyst in mainstream methods of chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) synthesis of graphene and carbon nanotubes.4−9 Although the growth mechanism of nanotubes from carbon supplied
through gaseous precursors has been described thoroughly,10−12 a clear understanding of the catalytic growth mechanism of graphene
or graphite from solid carbon sources has not yet been provided. The
use of Ni on single-crystal and polycrystalline diamonds often results
in a formation of uncontrolled number of graphitic layers at the Ni–diamond
interface or on top of the catalyst, impeding the formation of high-quality
graphene-on-diamond.13−16 On ultrananocrystalline diamond the catalytic reaction leads to
a Ni-carbon layer exchange yielding single-layer graphene, however,
without preserving the initial diamond.17

In this paper, we study the atomic structure of diamond–graphite
interfaces formed by a Ni-mediated transformation. Using aberration-corrected
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) applied to specimens in cross-sectional
geometry, our atom-by-atom observation provides important insight
into the interaction between two carbon lattices with extremely different
electronic properties; it explains the process of a nanocrystalline
diamond (NCD) to graphite transformation mediated by Ni while drilling
channels along grain boundaries. The hemispherical morphology of the
protruding Ni nanoparticles as well as the crystal orientation and
lattice defects of the graphite are explained in terms of a high uniaxial
stress that builds up in the channels due to the volume expansion
caused by the allotropic transformation. As a highlight, the experimental
results provide strong evidence for covalent bonding of graphite to
diamond. Electrical transport through the graphitized surface of diamond
is interpreted by a modified fluctuation-assisted tunneling mechanism,
showing a possible way for graphene–diamond devices.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the as-grown NCD film
prior to Ni deposition. Faceted crystals (average size of ∼250
nm) that are frequently twinned are clearly resolved. Charging under
the scanning electron beam causes their contrast to be brighter in
the upper left than the lower right. After the deposition of 20 nm
Ni layer, the topographic contrast of the diamond grains appears more
homogeneous due to an even charge distribution on the conductive surface
(Figure 1b). The secondary
electron (SE) image of the sample annealed at 1073 K for 10 min (Figure 1c) shows a granular
and corrugated surface topography. A high number density of round
Ni nanoparticles (∼ 45 particles per square micrometer, average
size of ∼110 nm) is observed at the surface. In Z-contrast
images collected with a backscattered electron (BSE) detector (Figure 1d), carbon appears
dark, whereas Ni particles shine bright. Further image contrast arises
from Ni nanoparticles (average size of ∼60 nm) embedded in
the carbon matrix below the specimen surface. Raman spectra (Figure S1) indicate that besides NCD and Ni particles,
there is graphite present in the sample as well.

Figure 2a,b shows
the bright-field (BF) and corresponding high-angle annular dark-field
(HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, respectively,
of the morphology of the NCD, graphite, and Ni nanoparticles. Because
graphite has a lower density than diamond (2.27 and 3.52 gcm–3 for graphite and diamond, respectively),18 the graphitic phase appears darker gray in the HAADF-STEM image
than diamond, whereas Ni appears bright due to the high atomic number.
The dominant features in Figure 2 are two channels filled with graphite that are drilled
into diamond along the grain boundaries by hemispherical Ni nanoparticles.

There are four scientific questions
that are addressed in the following:What is the atomic structure and interfacial interaction
between diamond and graphite at the walls of the channel?

What is the mechanism of the catalytic transformation
of diamond to graphite resulting in the formation of the channels?

How can graphite fit to the insufficient
channel volume?

What is the cause for
the hemispherical shape of the
Ni nanoparticles drilling the channel?



To investigate the interfacial structure and bonding of graphite
to diamond at the walls of the channel, we analyze the interface at
atomic resolution using aberration-corrected high-resolution TEM (HRTEM).
Due to the curvature along the channel circumference, however, it
was rather challenging to find a suitable crystallographic edge-on
orientation of the interface. A typical HRTEM image (as presented
in Figure S2) is often obscured by moiré
contrast effects arising from the different phases overlapping in
the TEM projection. Nevertheless, we managed to obtain an excellent
edge-on geometry of the diamond-graphite interface as shown in Figure 3a. It corresponds
to a configuration in which the interface is made up by a single segment
of given crystalline orientation that can be put into edge-on projection
suitable for atom-by-atom analysis.

Figure 3 Diamond–graphite interface. (a)
HRTEM image of the diamond–graphite
interface (BD = [110] = [112̅0]). (b) Fourier-filtered
image of the area marked by a yellow rectangle in (a). The filtered
image is superimposed by a structural model of the interface where
graphitic (0001) planes in an AA-stacking sequence are attached to
the (1̅11̅) surface of diamond. In the structural model
directly at the interface, terminating atoms show a tendency to relax
to minimize bond length. In particular, the second (0001) graphite
plane from the right has two possibilities for relaxation (either
relaxing to the left, see the bright atoms, or right).

Figure 3a shows
an HRTEM image of the diamond-graphite interface with the (0001) basal
planes of graphite aligned almost perpendicular to the interface.
In the case of diamond and graphite, crystallographic planes and directions
were denoted by the three-component Miller and the four-component
Miller-Bravais indices, respectively. Because the stacking sequence
of graphite is frequently observed to deviate from the AB low-energy
modification, a primitive unit cell with the lattice parameter c giving
the distance of adjacent basal planes is used throughout the paper.
A detailed analysis of the atomic columns resolved in the graphite
lattice near the interface shows that the interface is running parallel
to (11̅00) and, thus, the beam direction (BD) is
[112̅0]. With respect to diamond, the interface runs along (1̅11̅)
so BD = [110]. Therefore, an epitaxic crystallographic
orientation relationship holds between the two lattices. The large
diamond surface segment parallel to {111} is only a particular case
of all possible diamond surface orientations. Nevertheless, it can
be considered as a model diamond–graphite interface, as similar
interface structures (interface segments parallel to low-index planes
of diamond and perpendicular to graphite basal planes) are frequently
present at the channel walls (see Figure 5 and panel 5 in Figure S2). The {111} termination plane in diamond imaged in Figure 3a is the most stable
orientation and forms an atomically sharp interface with graphite.
The (11̅1̅) diamond planes have an inclination of ∼
25.5° with respect to the (0001) graphite planes. Because the
image is calibrated by adjusting the interplanar spacing of the {111}
diamond planes to 0.206 nm (see ref (18)), an average interplanar distance of the (0001)
graphite planes of 0.359 nm is obtained. This is higher than the interplanar
distance of 0.334 nm (see ref (19)) for AB- and ABC-stacked graphite but only slightly differs
from the distance of 0.355 nm (see ref (20)) reported for the AA-stacking. The stacking
sequence is confirmed by analyzing the projected atomic columns of
graphite in the Fourier-filtered image (see Figure 3b, taken from the area marked by the dashed
rectangle in Figure 3a using a slightly different defocus). Considering the angle between
these layers and the interface (∼84° and 70.5°, respectively),
the projected distance at the interface yields a ratio of 1.65, which
deviates quite considerably from a proposed coherent lattice match
(ratio of 1.5), where at an {112} interface of diamond, 3 {111} planes
merge to two (0001) graphite planes.21

The Fourier-filtered image of the area marked with the white dashed
rectangle from Figure 3a was further analyzed in Figure 4a,b, where we plotted the intensity profiles of the
first four atomic planes parallel to the interface for diamond along
the [121] direction and for graphite along ∼ [0001] direction.
With increasing distance from the interface, the planes are labeled
with i = 1, 2, 3,··· in diamond and i = −1, −2, −3,··· in
graphite. There is no regular match of the projected atomic columns
between the planes 1 and −1 at the interface. In addition,
coherency dislocations are absent. To create coherent diamond–graphite
interfaces, a number of solutions were proposed in literature, but
none of them can be applied to our results. Stacking faults in the
diamond proposed to create a coherent interface were not observed;21 neither the three {111} to two (0001) planes
(3 to 2)21 nor a 2-to-1 conversion of these
planes were observed.20 Our experimental
result identifies an incoherent interface between diamond and graphite.
To evaluate the type of bonding at the incoherent interface, we measure
the distances of the adjacent (1̅11̅) planes i and i + 1, and (11̅00) planes i and i – 1 running parallel to the interface
and plot in the Figure 4c. While the interplanar distances in diamond are in good agreement
with the literature value 0.206 nm (see ref (18)), the distances in graphite
are slightly lower than those calculated from the reported value 0.213
nm (see ref (20)) (horizontal
dashed lines in Figure 4c). The interface width between the diamond plane 1 and graphite
plane −1 (labeled as 0) is 0.223 nm, which is only slightly
larger than the values for the covalently bonded planes (1̅11̅)
of diamond and (11̅00) of graphite (∼ 8% and 5%, respectively).
This indicates a similar covalent nature of bonding between the terminating
diamond and graphite atoms at the interface. This raises the question
of whether or not covalent bonds across an incoherent interface are
possible. Based on the results of first principal calculations outlined
in refs (22)–24), covalent bonds were
found across incoherent interfaces. However, this is very depending
on the local relaxed atomic configuration. In particular, the formation
of covalent bonds is favored when the terminating atoms on both sides
of the interface are located atop of each other (i.e., with a minimal distance). In our experimental result, the HRTEM
contrast distant from the interface is well-matched by rigid structural
models of diamond and graphite (in Figure 3b, the structural model is superimposed on
the bright dots, assuming that they correspond to the position of
the projected atomic columns). Directly at the interface, the terminating
atoms of graphite were allowed to deviate from the rigid structural
model to match the HRTEM contrast best. Interestingly, the relaxed
positions all show a tendency of adopting short-distance on-top configurations
with the terminating atoms of diamond. This is exactly what is predicted
theoretically for the formation of covalent bonds (see refs (22)–24). In Figure 3b, even strong evidence of splitting of atomic positions
of graphite is obtained when the termination is approximately in the
middle of two terminating diamond positions (see the second atomic
column of graphite from the right). To achieve on-top positions, part
of the graphite atoms in the projected atomic column seem to move
to the left and part to the right.

profiles were drawn in the direction parallel to the diamond and graphite
interface. (c) Distances of adjacent (1̅11̅) diamond and

distance between the first diamond and graphite plane. The horizontal
dashed lines represent the (1̅11̅) and (11̅00) interplanar
distances (0.206 and 0.213 nm, respectively) reported in the literature.
The error bar corresponds to an experimental error, i.e., the measurement accuracy of the distances between two planes. It
is given by the width of 1 pixel and corresponds to a value of ∼
15 pm. (d) SD of the distances between the projected atomic columns
of the (1̅11̅) and (11̅00) planes.

The covalent bonding restricts the terminating
atoms of graphite
to a close distance from the terminating (1̅11̅) plane
of diamond, which, in turn, imposes the AA-stacking sequence of the
(0001) graphite planes to form near the interface. However, the HRTEM
images projecting atomic columns of the (0001) graphite provide evidence
that, in the center of graphitic channel, the atomic configuration
adopts the AB-stacking sequence, i.e., its low-energy
structural modification; Figure S5 presents
one of the regions with AB-stacked layers. Using the intensity profiles
of Figure 4b, the distances
of adjacent atomic columns along the interface were measured. Figure 4d shows the standard
deviation (SD) of these interatomic distances in the diamond (1̅11̅)
and graphite (11̅00) planes. Starting from the interface, the
SD decreases rapidly on both sides of the interface (more rapidly
for diamond than for graphite) and saturates below a value ∼15
pm after four layers. However, a significant increase of SD by a factor
of ∼3 for the interfacial layers indicates local rearrangements
of atoms to optimize covalent bonding across the interface.

There is further indication of a strong covalent bond at the interface. Figure 5 shows a channel filled with graphite, where the (0001) planes
are clearly resolved. We observe a dependence of the orientation of
these lattice planes on the position along the channel. Starting from
the dashed line where the graphite planes are flat, they increasingly
bend with increasing distance along the z-axis of
the channel (Figure 5).

Figure 5 TEM image of a graphite-filled channel between two diamond grains.
Panels 1–3 show the FFT of the graphite lattice structure inside
the corresponding areas adjacent to the lower right channel wall.

The panels 1–3 in Figure 5 show fast Fourier
transform (FFT) representations
(displayed as the power spectra) of the graphitic structures inside
the squares 1–3 at the lower right wall of the channel in NCD
displayed in the TEM image. Overall, the orientation of graphitic
planes in the channel can be well described with circular segments
(Figure 5 and the sketch
in Figure 6a). The
curvature (inverse of the radius) of the circular segments as a function
of the distance from the Ni particle is shown in Figure 6b (negative and positive values
correspond to a concave and convex curvature, respectively). While
the basal planes attached to the Ni particle exactly follow the slightly
concave curvature of the particle backside, the value of the curvature
increases with increasing distance along the channel; at a distance
of about 30 nm, the curvature is almost zero and then becomes convex.
Due to the curvature, the local orientation of graphite at the channel
walls also systematically changes with position. The orientation at
three different positions along the channel wall (squares 1–3)
are analyzed through the FFT (panels 1–3 in Figure 5) as follows: arc-like intensity
maxima originate from the (0001) planes of the graphite. With the
increasing distance from the Ni surface (i.e., from
panel 1–3), the averaged rotational orientation of intensity
maxima (full straight lines) turns clockwise, accompanied by widening
of these segments (dashed lines). Thus, the (0001) planes that are
running almost normal to the diamond–graphite interface in
position 1 gradually rotate toward the interface with increasing distance
from the Ni particle. The widening of the arc-like intensities with
increasing distance is related, first, to the increase of the curvature
of the (0001) lattice planes and also to the local structural disorder
(rotational misorientation of small segments of the (0001) planes),
which gradually increases toward the top of the channel.

The (0001) planes are marked by green dashed lines. Red dislocations
symbols indicate terminating (0001) lattice planes. A kink-band is
indicated by the dashed blue line. The concave backplane of the Ni
particle is shown by a solid red line. (b) Experimental data of the
curvature of the graphitic planes obtained from the TEM image in Figure 5 plotted as a function
of the distance from zero curvature. The red line represents a fit
of the data assuming h = (α – 1)x.

Quantitatively, the experimental
data points are rather well fitted
by a simplified model with a single parameter α that reflects
the ratio of the number of lattice planes Nc formed in the center to those formed directly at
the walls, Nw. Therefore, (Nc = αNw), which also
implies that (h + x) = αx or h = (α – 1)x,
where h(x) is the height of the
circular segment depending on x, the distance from
the flat plane assigned to position 0 in Figure 6a. Then the fit to the experimental data
of the curvature C of the graphitic planes (Figure 5) is plotted as a
function of the distance x (Figure 6b). Fitting yields a factor of α ≈
1.3, meaning that about 30% more lattice planes are present in the
center than adjacent to the walls of the graphite channel.

However,
the geometrical model in Figure 6 does not offer understanding of the mechanism
of formation of the graphite-filled channel in NCD drilled by the
Ni particle. We propose an explanation of the processes that lead
to the formation of the channels along the grain boundaries in NCDs,
covalent attachments of graphitic planes to diamond, the curvature
of the (0001) basal planes in the channel and the shape the hemispherical
Ni particles at the bottom of the channels. Three aspects play a crucial
role in these processes: (i) the catalytic reaction of Ni with diamond,
(ii) opening dangling bonds on the diamond surface as the Ni particle
moves deeper into diamond, and (iii) the volume expansion when diamond
transforms to graphite.

In contact with diamond, the Ni particle
catalytically releases
interfacial carbon atoms. Although the bulk diffusion of C atoms through
the Ni particle at temperatures of 1073 K cannot be excluded, studies
have shown that the energetically favorable mechanism for the movement
of C atoms across a Ni particle is surface diffusion.9−12 Therefore, we assume that the carbon atoms released from diamond
in front of the propagating Ni particle migrate along the diamond–Ni
interface toward the trailing end of the Ni particle; the removal
of carbon atoms at the front side of the Ni particle opens space for
the Ni particle to penetrate one atomic layer deeper into diamond,
leaving behind one atomic layer with dangling bonds at the diamond
surface open. The released carbon atoms are available to saturate
the dangling bonds of diamond and then to continue to grow a graphene
layer along the backside of Ni (Figure S3). This explains the covalent attachment of graphite layers to diamond
along the channel walls shown in the TEM image in Figure 3a. Once the first graphene
layer has formed, the next layer nucleates due to the constant supply
of carbon atoms from diamond at the front of the Ni particle. The
length of graphite channels formed during annealing is in the range
of 100–150 nm (Figure 2). This is less than that observed in the case of forming
free pores by Ni-etching of NCD diamond in a hydrogen atmosphere converting
the carbon released from diamond to methane gas25 rather than to graphite filling the drilled channels as
in the present case. A growth rate of graphite in the range of 0.17–0.25
nms–1 is obtained (assuming that during annealing
at 1073 K for 10 min the Ni particle moved at a constant speed). As
shown above, the number of newly formed graphite layers progressively
increases from the channel wall toward the center (Figure 5). The physical reason for
this is a significant increase in the molar volume V of the forming graphite with respect to that of the removed diamond
because, at 1073 K, for graphite,26Vg = 5.54 cm3/mol, and for diamond,27Vd = 3.44 cm3/mol, the ratio Vg/Vd = 1.61 leads to a uniaxial transformation strain of
0.61 along the z-axis of the channel. In a confined
situation, where the channel is blocked by surrounding diamond crystals,
by the Ni particle at the bottom, and by the newly formed graphite
at the top, the uniaxial strain is supposed to yield a compressive
stress in graphite parallel to the z-axis of the
channel. To release this stress, material has to be pushed out of
the channel. The covalent bonding of graphite to the channel walls
prevents both the upward movement of the graphite column in the channel
as a compact block and the migration of material along the channel
walls. Considering the crystallographic orientation of graphite with
its c-axis aligned parallel to the z-axis of the channel, a simple estimate based on linear elasticity
yields the stress σc = c33εc = 17 GPa, where c33 =
28 GPa (ref (28)) is
the elastic constant of graphite at 1073 K, and εc is the strain in the direction of the c-axis. Certainly, linear elasticity does not apply for
such a large transformation strain. Material must be pushed out of
the channel by mechanisms of plasticity, releasing tensile strain
to a certain value that can be accommodated elastically. Plastic flow
might occur by the glide of prismatic dislocations (with a Burgers
vector [0001] and a glide plane of (112̅0) or (11̅00)).
A large number of isolated dislocations or dislocation dipoles that
have a component Burgers vector normal to the basal planes of graphite
that equals [0001] are observed in graphite filling the channel (see Figure S4). In addition, the elastic compressive
stress exerted on the graphite channel might also activate other mechanisms
of plasticity such as the formation of kink bands, rupture of basal
planes, and delamination,29 which may cause
the graphitic layers to pop out of the channel. Due to the high strain
of εc = 0.61, the
work W = σc0εc done by the plastic deformation of graphite, which is necessary
to pop material out of the channel, is quite significant (σc0 is the critical stress needed to activate mechanisms of plastic
deformation of the graphite). In the literature, an experimental value
at room temperature of σc in the range of 0.3–0.4 GPa (ref (29)) for plasticity of graphite
induced by stress acting along the c-axis (like in
the present case) was reported. Using these values yields W in the range of 1.0–1.4 kJ/mol. This work is provided
by the chemical driving force Δg of the transformation
(i.e., the difference gg – gd of the Gibbs free enthalpy of diamond and graphite; at the
temperature 1073 K, Δg = −6.3 kJ/mol;
see ref (30)). Therefore, W amounts to a fraction of about 20% of the chemical driving
force. In addition, the residual elastic stress in graphite increases
its Gibbs free enthalpy with respect to that of diamond. However,
as compared to the total difference of their Gibbs free energies,
this increase in elastic energy (given by (σc0)2/2c33) is rather moderate (about 0.015
kJ/mol for σc0 = 0.4 GPa). In other words, the curvature
observed in the graphite structure filling the channels edged in NCD
is a consequence of a significant uniaxial transformation strain;
the corresponding stresses acting along the c-axis
of the graphite exceed the critical yield stress to activate mechanisms
of plasticity pushing material out of the channel. The work of plastic
deformation is provided by the chemical driving force.

As for
the shape of the Ni particles, the same reason causing plasticity
in graphite above the Ni particle explains their flat backside morphology:
the remaining elastic tensile strain in the channel would in turn
exert a corresponding compressive stress on the backside surface of
the Ni particle. While the surface of the Ni particle in contact with
the NCD is rather spherical to minimize the surface area, the backside
Ni surface facing graphite is reshaped by the remaining compressive
stress and becomes flat or even concave.

Our structural investigations
on the atomic scale suggest that
the overall structure consists of graphitic domains that might be
interconnected into a percolating network. To probe percolation between
the domains, characterization on the macroscopic-scale is done by
measuring electronic transport along the entire sample surface. The
electrical conductance as a function of temperature G(T) between 4.2 and 300 K measured in the 4-probe
configuration is presented in Figure 7a (orange line).

Figure 7 Temperature-dependent electrical conductance
of the graphitized
surface of diamond. (a) Experimental data (orange line) is fitted
by the eq 1 (blue dashed
line overlapping the experimental data). Individual terms contributing
to eq 1 are also plotted
separately (blue dashed lines). (b) Schematic illustration of the
conductance terms in eq 1.

In the case of conductive (graphitic)
domains forming a percolating
network, the mechanism of electronic transport known as fluctuation-assisted
tunneling (FAT)31−33 can be used to describe our system. The FAT model
applied to the temperature-dependent conductance curve in Figure 7a fits to our experimental
data with an excellent agreement but only when we add a term that
is linearly dependent on temperature: 1  where G0 is a constant (in units of SK–1) and G1 is a prefactor of the residual conductance
at T = 0 K, Tb characterizes
the tunneling energy barrier between conductive regions, and Ts determines tunneling efficiency at T = 0 K. We propose an interpretation of two conductance
contributions, where the FAT term with a very small tunneling barrier
(Tb < 2 K) is assigned to a transport
mechanism between graphene flakes within disordered graphitic domains,
whereas the linear term corresponds to an “activation”
of conduction paths across the boundaries between graphitic domains
with irregular distances (see blue and orange arrows in the illustration
in Figure 7b). The
full fitting function, as well as each of the terms, are plotted in Figure 7a (as blue dashed
lines) and the values of the fitted parameters are G0 = 2.145 × 10–6 SK–1, G1 = 0.00246 S, Tb = 1.97 K, and Ts = 9.48 K. The
small value of the tunneling energy barrier of 0.17 meV obtained from
the fit corresponds to the charge transport between the graphene flakes
in the graphitic domains.

To summarize, we propose a schematic
model that illustrates the
mechanism of catalytic transformation of the polycrystalline diamond
structure into graphite (Figure 8).At the contact
of Ni particles with diamond, C atoms
are catalytically etched preferably at grain boundaries. C atoms diffuse
under the Ni surface, propagate along the Ni–diamond interface
and are released at the Ni particle back side forming a layer of graphene
(Figure 8a). This opens
space for the Ni particle to move deeper into diamond. Due to a continuous
supply of etched carbon, a second layer of graphene nucleates underneath
the first, starting to form a dome of graphite surrounding the particle
(Figure 8b,c).

As the Ni particle moves downward along
the diamond
grain boundary, a channel is formed, leaving unsaturated dangling
bonds at the diamond surface above the Ni particle (Figure 8b,c).

Free C atoms covalently attach to the dangling bonds
of diamond, and graphite grows from the walls toward the center of
the channel.

Significant volume expansion
during graphite formation
from diamond results in uniaxial stress, released by the mechanism
of plasticity that allows graphite to be pushed out of the channel.

The backside of the Ni particle is flattened
by the
uniaxial stress of the graphitic planes constrained by the insufficient
volume of the channel (Figure 8d).

different stages during the diamond-to-graphite transformation. Green
arrows point to the release of C at the Ni-diamond interface, its

Red arrows indicate the movement direction of the Ni particle drilling
a channel into the diamond. Compressive stresses (blue arrows) caused
by volume expansion during diamond-to-graphite transformation act
on the backside of the Ni particle, activate mechanisms of plasticity,
and material push-out along the channel.

Conclusions
Our study of the catalytic transformation of
diamond to graphite
and the obtained results under well-defined experimental conditions
enabled us to propose the comprehensive model that explains the mechanism
of the transformation process:We found channels along the boundaries of diamond grains
filled with graphite and with a hemispherical Ni particle at the front
of the graphite channels (BF and HAADF STEM).

We found graphite basal planes in perpendicular orientation
with respect to the surface of the diamond (HRTEM).

We found and explained covalent bonding at the diamond–graphitic
interface (HRTEM analysis).

We found
and interpreted significant bending of the
graphite planes as a consequence of the uniaxial stress that builds
up in graphite due to the limited channel volume. The stress is reduced
by plastic deformation.

We explained
the hemispherical shape of Ni particles
at the channel front by uniaxial stress in the channel.

We proposed a consistent model that explains the process
of the diamond-to-graphite transformation mediated by Ni drilling
channels along the NCD grain boundaries.

We also measured electronic transport along the graphitized
surface of NCD and proposed a mechanism of modified fluctuation-assisted
tunneling with an additional term linearly dependent on temperature.



Methods
Using
focused microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(MWPECVD equipped with an ellipsoidal cavity resonator Aixtron P6),
nominally undoped NCD films were grown on p-type Si(100) wafer substrates
with a 1.5 μm thick SiO2 layer. Onto the NCD, 20
nm Ni films were deposited using a DC magnetron sputtering system.
Next, the samples were annealed in a Carbolite tube furnace under
low pressure of 10–6 mbar at the temperature of
1073 K for 10 min.

Raman spectroscopy was carried out at room
temperature by using
a WITec alpha300 RA confocal microscope with 488 nm excitation wavelength.
Raman spectra with a 60 s exposure time and 4 mW laser power were
acquired. A pair of objective lenses, 100x/0.9 and
50x/0.55, and a 1200 g/mm grating were used in the
measurements.

SEM investigations were performed using a Zeiss
Supra 55 VP operated
at 10 kV employing the SE InLens detector and back-scattered BSE detector.
In the case of the nonconductive as-grown diamond film the strong
charging effects in the electron beam (limiting resolution, causing
image distortions, and changing the overall contrast obtained by SE)
were minimized by adjusting the focus and astigmatism slightly off
the actual area of interest and keeping the exposure time as short
as possible.

The specimens for (S)TEM-investigations were prepared
in cross-sectional
geometry by focused ion beam (FIB) sputtering using an FEI Quanta
3D FEG instrument. Before, protective 100 nm Au and 1 μm Pt
layers were deposited onto the specimen surface to prevent beam damage
during the preparation. Gallium FIB settings during foil preparation
were at 30 kV using successively lower ion probe currents ranging
from 30 nA to 10 pA. The foil was thinned to a thickness of 40–50
nm and subsequently cleaned at FIB settings of 5 kV/48 pA and 2 kV/27pA.

HRTEM and STEM was carried out at 200 kV using a JEOL JEM ARM200-F
(S)TEM (equipped with Cs correctors for both the objective lens and
the condenser system) and an FEI Titan 80–300 (S)TEM (Cs corrector
for the objective lens). In BF STEM, the contrast strongly depends
on the crystalline orientation of the different phases (diamond, Ni,
graphite), while the HAADF STEM can be used to distinguish the different
chemical species and densities of these phases. (S)TEM images were
analyzed by using the Gatan DigitalMicrograph software. Fourier-filtered
images were obtained by a fast Fourier transformation (FFT), in which
only the spatial frequencies of the diamond and graphite lattice were
allowed to contribute to the filtered image.

Electrical transport
measurement was performed in 4-probe configuration
controlled by a source-meter Keithley 2635B supplying a constant current
100 nA. The temperature was changed from 300 to 4.2 K by moving a
tubular sample chamber filled with He gas inside the LHe container.
A Si diode was calibrated to measure the temperature, supplying a
constant 10 μA current and measuring the voltage with a Keithley
2000 voltometer.
