Optical antennas made of metallic
nanostructures dramatically enhance
single-molecule fluorescence to boost the detection sensitivity. Moreover,
emission properties detected at the optical far field are dictated
by the antenna. Here we study the emission from molecule–antenna
hybrids by means of super-resolution localization and defocused imaging.
Whereas gold nanorods make single-crystal violet molecules in the
tip’s vicinity visible in fluorescence, super-resolution localization
on the enhanced molecular fluorescence reveals geometrical centers
of the nanorod antenna instead. Furthermore, emission angular distributions
of dyes linked to the nanorod surface resemble that of nanorods in
defocused imaging. The experimental observations are consistent with
numerical calculations using the finite-difference time-domain method.

==== Body
Optical antennas,
the counterparts
of traditional radio and microwave antennas, are devices designed
to efficiently convert freely propagating optical radiation into localized
energy, and vice versa.1,2 To operate
at optical frequencies, optical antennas must possess characteristic
dimensions on the same order as that of the light wavelength (hundreds
of nanometers). Supporting localized surface plasmon metallic nanostructures
made of gold or silver are excellent examples of optical antennas.
On one hand, the highly concentrated electromagnetic fields generated
in the antenna’s near field can enhance excitation and facilitate
photochemical reactions,3 charge separation,4 optical trapping,5 catalysis,6 and nonlinear optical phenomena.7 Not only is the local light intensity increased
dramatically compared to the incident light intensity, the local density
of optical states (LDOS) around the antenna is altered, leading to
altered radiative and nonradiative rates of emitters.8,9 In this way, the emission properties, including intensity, quantum
yield, and lifetime, can be modified.9−11 On the other hand, radiation
from emitters close to the antenna will be emitted to the far field via the antenna through efficient coupling. The antenna
therefore dominates the emission of an efficiently coupled system.
Hence, the emission properties in the far field, such as light directionality,12 polarization, and spectra,13,14 can be engineered using dedicated optical antennas. Many potential
applications of optical antennas in photonics,2,12,14,15 chemistry,16−19 physics,10,18,20−23 and biological science24,25 have yet to be fully
explored.

Although the fundamental concept of optical antennas
is simple,
experimental work, particularly with single molecules, is hindered
by difficulties in manipulating and positioning individual molecules
with respect to the antenna with molecular precision. Often relying
on near-field manipulators,8,15,18,26,27 statistics,9,14,28 or chemical binding,29−31 experimental observations on individual emitters
interacting with optical antennas have yielded many essential insights.
Attaching a spherical or rod gold antenna onto a pointed probe, the
groups of Novotny and Sandoghdar have revealed the strong spatial
dependency of the interactions between single emitters and optical
antennas.8,18,27 Randomly doping
dye molecules with a low fluorescence quantum yield in a thin polymer
matrix around an array of gold bowtie antennas, Kinkhabwala etal. showed enormous fluorescence enhancements
up to 1340-fold on single molecules and quantified changes over radiative
and nonradiative rates of single emitters in the vicinity of gold
bowtie antennas.9 However, the above-mentioned
methods can be applied only to immobile molecules. Employing specific
molecular bindings to position single fluorophores at the tips of
gold nanorods, Fu etal. demonstrated
a strong enhancement of 40-fold on single-molecule fluorescence.29 Nevertheless, DNA linkers placed between the
fluorophores and antennas limit the accessible volume of the fluorophores.
Recently, allowing dyes to diffuse in a viscous liquid medium, a 1000-fold
enhancement was reported on single-molecule fluorescence using single-nanorod
antennas.10,16,32

Because
of its short range of some tens of nanometers, the interaction
of an individual emitter with an optical antenna is difficult to characterize
spatially using diffraction-limited far-field techniques. Super-resolution
localization microscopy,33 operating via the optical far field, however, can provide resolutions
beyond the diffraction limit. It utilizes the stochastic nature of
emissions from single quantum emitters to pinpoint individual emission
events and thus to reconstruct structures34,35 or interaction sites36,37 with accuracies of tens of nanometers.
Several super-resolution studies on molecule–metal–nanostructure
hybrids37−43 have revealed that the emission localization can be strongly influenced
by interactions between molecules and the nanostructures. Weber etal. reported that super-resolution localization
on molecule–nanostructure hybrids using surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) signals or fluorescence signals can result in
noticeable differences in emission positions.40 Recently, Su etal. found that
the metallic nanostructures with which the emitters are interacting
can induce significant “distortions” of the point spread
functions (PSFs), depending on nanostructure dimensions.44 Blythe etal. demonstrated significant mismatches between nanorod dimensions
revealed in super-resolution imaging and those revealed in AFM images
of the same rods, regardless of the employed fitting models.45 However, the understanding of the reported distortions
and dimension mismatches remains elusive due to the lack of information
about the antenna effect and the coupling between the emitter and
the nanostructure, as indicated in a very recent report by Biteen’s
group.46 Therefore, additional measures
besides super-resolution localization have to be employed for a better
understanding of the reported complex behavior of single emitters
interacting with metallic nanostructures.

Relying on the anisotropic
angular distribution of dipolar emission
near the boundary of media with distinct refractive indices, defocused
imaging allows one to visualize real-time changes in angular distributions
of dipolar emission.47−51 In a conventional imaging system, the dipole radiation pattern is
projected into the detection plane and is focused to an Airy disk,
which conceals the angular distribution of emission from an emitter.
Deliberately introducing an aberration by slightly offsetting the
dipole emitter away from the focal plane,47,48 however, results in defocused patterns that reflect the emission
angular distribution. Being sensitive to emission angular distributions,
subtle changes in emission properties of molecule–antenna hybrids
can be detected in a dynamic manner. Therefore, defocused imaging
can potentially reveal how positions or orientations of individual
molecular emitters influence the emission properties of the hybrid
system in situ, where mobility of molecules is allowed.
Resembling dipolar antennas, single-crystalline gold nanorods are
simple and highly efficient optical antennas. The plasmon-related
photoluminescence emission from nanorods,52 particularly the emission that corresponds to the longitudinal plasmon
resonance, resembles dipolar emission.53 Therefore, a nanorod’s emission can be simulated and mapped
using the dipolar model in defocused imaging.48,54 Moreover, plasmonic and antenna properties of gold nanorods can
be easily controlled by tuning their dimensions10,55via low-cost wet-chemical synthesis56 or oxidative etching.57

Here, we apply super-resolution localization and defocused
microscopy
to investigate the coupling between single-molecule emitters and an
individual gold nanorod optical antenna and to study the emission
properties of the hybrid system in a dynamic fashion. Allowing weakly
fluorescent molecules to diffuse in a viscous solvent, as reported
in the literature,10,16,32 we first apply super-resolution localization using conventional
2D Gaussian fitting on strongly coupled molecule–antenna hybrids.
Moreover, we correlate the located emission events with the nanoantenna
structure visualized in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Combining
with defocused imaging studies on fluorophores attached onto nanorods,
we investigate the emission distribution dependence on molecule–antenna
interactions. Furthermore, numerical calculations were carried out
using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to understand
the experimental findings.

Results and Discussions
Super-resolution Localization
Imaging on Gold Nanorod Antennas
Surrounded with Crystal Violet (CV) in Glycerol
Gold nanorods
synthesized using the seed-mediated method58 show an average length of 69 ± 7 nm and an average diameter
of 32 ± 5 nm in SEM micrographs (Figure 1a). Their extinction spectrum in aqueous
solution shows two distinct peaks (Figure 1b, the blue curve). The peak around 520 nm
corresponds to the transverse plasmon resonance. The other peak around
638 nm corresponds to the longitudinal plasmon resonance, which overlaps
with the excitation laser wavelength (644 nm), the absorption (the
black curve), and the emission spectra of CV (the red curve), as shown
in Figure 1b. The overlapping
spectra favor enhancement of the emission signal and ensure an efficient
coupling of the emitter and the antenna.10Figure 1c shows the
near-field optical intensity enhancement map around a gold nanorod.

Double-ended arrows represent CV molecules in glycerol.

CV was used here because of its low intrinsic fluorescence
quantum
yield and the large previously observed fluorescence enhancements
of up to a thousand times.32 Therefore,
the fluorescence emission from molecules in the vicinity of nanorod
tips can be easily distinguished from the constant background from
unenhanced molecules in the focal volume and from nanorod photoluminescence.
Moreover, the near-field volume, where the molecule’s fluorescence
is enhanced, is a few thousand times smaller than the focal volume,
as shown in Figure 1c. Hence, the enhanced fluorescence emission from single molecules
can be distinguished, even at high concentrations of nonenhanced molecules
up to several micromolar.16

Here,
we employed the same experimental configuration as reported
in the literature,10,32 as shown in Figure 1d. Gold nanorods were deposited
on a glass cover slide and were then covered by a drop of 500 nM CV
glycerol solution. A typical wide-field fluorescence image is shown
in Figure 2a. Due to
their constant photoluminescence, gold nanorods and fluorescent beads
can be easily distinguished from the fluorescence background from
CV molecules. Figure 2b shows a fluorescence time trace of a gold nanorod, a time trace
of a fluorescent bead, and a time trace of the background. In contrast
to constant fluorescence background from CV in glycerol (in black
color) and the almost constant bright fluorescence signal from the
fluorescent bead (in red color), intense fluorescence bursts can be
observed in the nanorod fluorescence time trace (in blue color). These
fluorescence bursts are attributed to molecules whose emission is
greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the single nanorod.32 Serving as drift correction and correlation
markers, fluorescent beads that show steady fluorescence can be easily
distinguished from nanorods, which show intense fluorescence fluctuations
in the presence of CV. Subtracting the constant background from nanorod
photoluminescence and unenhanced CV molecules, the spatial photon
distribution of each fluorescent burst was fitted using a 2D Gaussian
function to locate the centroid of this emission.

fluorescence image of a 5 μm ×
5 μm area. The red square highlights a fluorescent bead. The
white square highlights a gold nanorod. The black square highlights
nonenhanced CV molecules in the background. The color bar represents
the fluorescence intensity (counts per second). (b) Fluorescence time
traces of the background (black), of the fluorescent bead (red), and
of a gold nanorod (blue).

After optical measurements, the sample was subjected to SEM
measurements
to correlate the fluorescence super-resolution images with their structures.
The correlation was done using 100 nm fluorescent beads as alignment
markers to project emission localizations on physical geometries of
nanorods. Figure 3a
shows a SEM image of a fluorescent bead, whose shape is outlined with
a green circle. The corresponding localization image after drift correction
is given in Figure 3b. The localization events over ten thousand frames showed a full-width
at half-maximum (FWHM) of 13 nm, shown in Figure 3c. Figure 3d and g show SEM images on two closely positioned rods
with different orientations. Their reconstructed localization images
are given in Figure 3e and h, respectively. Both nanorods showed almost isotropic emission
event distributions, but with different FWHMs of 13 and 27 nm. These
values are comparable to the diameters of the nanorods and are smaller
than the lengths of the rods. The different FWHMs are due to the different
plasmon resonances of the nanorods, which lead to different enhanced
burst intensities of CV molecules.10 The
localization precision of each localization event is determined by
the fluorescence intensity of the burst event.33 Therefore, bursts of lower fluorescence intensities have
larger uncertainties of localization, thus showing broader distributions
of localization events. The correlation between FWHMs of localization
event distributions and the maximum enhanced fluorescence events on
each nanorod is demonstrated in Figure S1.

outline of the nanorods. The red solid lines are fitted Gaussian profiles.

To minimize the influence from
distortions in the optical and SEM
images, we overlaid localization images and SEM images only on a 8
μm × 8 μm area, in which at least two beads were
present. We noticed that reconstructed centroids of the enhanced fluorescence
from CV molecules were overlaid with the centers of gold nanorods,
as shown in Figure 3e and h. The localization result is about 30 nm away from both tips
of the nanorod, where the strong fluorescence enhancement occurs to
result in discernible single-molecule fluorescence. Despite the crude
estimation of the PSF we applied here, the observed far-field emission
from centers of nanorods indicates that the emission from molecular
emitters strongly couples into the antenna, while the fluorescence
from emitters is largely enhanced.

FDTD on Super-resolution
Localization of Enhanced CV Emission
in the Vicinity of a Gold Nanorod
FDTD calculations were
carried out on emission from molecule–antenna hybrids to understand
the results in our experiments. The emission of the hybrid comes in
two ways. On one hand, photoluminescence from a nanorod, a constant
and reproducible background, can be easily eliminated by subtraction
in each image frame. On the other hand, the molecular emission is
altered by the nanorod antenna, which is the major contributing factor
for the experimental observations in this work. In the following,
we examine the influences of the nanorod antenna on the single-molecule
emission by numerical calculations.

A dimensionless emissive
dipole was used to model a dye molecule. The emitted light from the
molecule was then monitored at an observation volume mimicking the
detection configurations at the far field. To mimic the strong coupling,
the dipole orientation was set to be parallel to the longitudinal
axis of the nanorod. The distance between the dipole and the gold
surface was chosen to be 5 nm in order to simulate the circumstances
of strong fluorescence enhancements.8,10 Three position
configurations, shown in Figure 4, were examined, respectively, a dipole at the tip
(position 1), at the corner (position 2), and at the side (position
3) of a nanorod. The calculated PSFs of single molecules under the
three circumstances show little differences that can hardly be noticed
in Figure 4a–c.
The interaction of the molecule’s emission with the nanorod
is better visualized in the optical near field. Figure 4d–f illustrate the near field around
the molecule–nanorod hybrids of the three configurations, showing
the disturbed molecular emission near-field distribution by the nanorod.

to the nanorod, illustrated in the drawings on top of each plot. (d–f)
Near-field distributions of molecular emission around the nanorod

using a 2D Gaussian PSF approximation on the three circumstances shown
in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. Red diamonds, black crosses, and
cyan dots are used to represent the actual position of the fluorophore,
the localized events using 2D Gaussian, and the center position of
the nanorod, respectively. (j–l) Emission angular distributions
in the xz and yz plane from the
molecule–antenna hybrids with different configurations in (a)–(c),
respectively. The red arrows highlight the asymmetric distribution
that leads to the off-center localization.

Localization inaccuracies inherent to conventional 2D Gaussian
fitting were then evaluated by applying 2D Gaussian fitting on the
calculated PSFs. The localization results are compared with the actual
positions of emitters in Figure 4g–i, where red diamonds represent the actual
positions of emitters, black crosses represent the localization events
based on 2D Gaussian approximation, and blue dots pinpoint the centers
of nanorods. At position 1, the localization position on the molecular
fluorescence shows an approximately 8 nm offset from the center of
the nanorod along the longitudinal direction, as illustrated in Figure 4g. The molecular
emission at position 2 was localized at a position 5 nm from the nanorod
center along the transverse direction. For the molecule at position
3, the localization was within 3 nm from the center of the nanorod.
Deviations on the localization positions from the center position
of the nanorod are less than 10 nm for other circumstances with different
in-plane dipole orientations. Moreover, the localization results show
different offset directions from centers of nanorods. Figure 4g shows an offset opposite
the side where the emitter locates, whereas the localization positions
in Figure 4h and i
show offsets toward the emitters.

The localization errors revealed
in the above are consequences
of the asymmetric emission angular distributions toward the far field
from the hybrids. The angular distribution of emitted light eventually
determines the pixelated intensity profile imaged at the fixed detection
plane and thus strongly influences the localization result.59Figure 4j–l illustrate the emission angular distributions that
correspond to the three position configurations. The emitter at position
1 shows an emission angular distribution that is asymmetric in the xz plane but symmetric in the yz plane,
as shown in Figure 4j. The lopsided emission along the longitudinal axis of the nanorod
results in the localization offset from the nanorod center toward
the direction opposite the emitter side. The emitters at position
2 and position 3, however, show significant asymmetry in the yz plane but little asymmetry in the xz plane, as demonstrated in Figure 4k and l, respectively. As a result, the localization
positions on emitters at position 2 and position 3 shift correspondingly
along the transverse direction toward the side where the emitters
locate.

Therefore, we summarize the above FDTD results in two
ways. (i)
The emission collected at the far field reflects the position of the
antenna instead of position of the emitter, demonstrating antenna
coupling. (ii) 2D Gaussian approximation on the PSF results in localization
errors up to 10 nm. Thus, the localization events will span over an
area within 20 nm. The estimated localization inaccuracy, which agrees
with the localization event distributions (FWHMs ranging from 13 to
30 nm) revealed in our experiment, is comparable to the nanorod diameter
but is less than the nanorod length.

Defocused Imaging of Gold
Nanorod Antennas Labeled with Alexa647
in Aqueous Buffer Solution
We further verified the role of
antenna coupling in emission to the far field by defocused fluorescence
imaging. Although CV molecules in glycerol can yield largely enhanced
fluorescence signals, the total number of photons in each fluorescence
burst is not sufficient to produce clear defocused patterns as the
emitted photons are divided onto many pixels in defocused imaging.
Moreover, the dwell time of a CV molecule in the near-field volume
is short.16 Furthermore, photobleaching
of CV molecules takes place in several hundred milliseconds,16 contributing to a limited number of photons
in each burst. In order to overcome the aforementioned experimental
limitations for defocused imaging, Alexa647 molecules were tethered
onto the surfaces of gold nanorods using thiolated biotine and dye–avidine
conjugates as illustrated in Figure 5a. Low concentrations of chemicals and rods were employed
to avoid rod–rod linkage due to the multiple binding pockets
of avidin. The distance between fluorophore and the gold surface is
estimated to be 5–7 nm. Alexa647 was employed for the following
reasons: (i) Its emission spectrum overlaps with the longitudinal
plasmon resonances of gold nanorods (Figure 6b); (ii) Alexa647 is known to blink under
certain buffer conditions, resulting in its wide application in single-molecule
super-resolution microscopy;44,60 (iii) Alexa647 has
a higher fluorescence quantum yield (0.33) and is more photostable
than CV. Upon labeling, the extinction spectrum of labeled nanorods
showed a 5 nm red-shift in the longitudinal peak (Figure 5b), indicating an increased
local refractive index around the nanorods.61

Figure 5 (a)

Extinction spectra of gold nanorods before and after label attachment
(red and blue, respectively) and the absorption spectrum (black) and
the emission spectrum (green) of Alexa647. (c) Snapshots of two defocused
patterns at different times. The two nanorods show random blinking
events. (d) Fluorescence intensity time traces of the nanorods highlighted
with white squares in (c). The stochastic blinking of each fluorophore
on the nanorods leads to discrete intensity levels in the fluorescence
time trajectories, from which we can estimate the number of fluorophores
on each nanorod. The red dashed lines are a guide to the eye to indicate
the aforementioned intensity levels.

Figure 6 (a) Fluorescence intensity time trace of a single nanorod labeled
with Alexa647 in the switching buffer. The red arrows and the associated
numbers indicate the frame numbers of selected images. (b) Set of
defocused patterns obtained from fluorescence bursts and from background
in the frames highlighted in (a). Patterns in the right column are
obtained by subtracting the patterns in the middle column (nanorod
photoluminescence patterns) from the patterns in the left column (patterns
of total intensities). The corresponding frame numbers are given on
top of each defocused pattern. The color bars represent fluorescence
intensities.

The labeling yield and
the labeling density were low, which is
evident from the fact that many nanorods showed steady photoluminescence
intensity without fluorescence blinking. In addition, the blinking
nanorods showed limited numbers of blinking events before bleaching
of Alexa647. Moreover, the surfactant’s low binding affinity
at nanorod tips due to gold surface atomic alignments and surface
curvatures makes the nanorod tips more likely to be exposed for binding
of thiolated biotin molecules at low cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) concentrations.57,61 Therefore, we can safely assume
that the majority of fluorophores are attached close to the tips of
nanorods in our experiment.

On moving the focal plane ∼1
μm away from the sample,
defocused fluorescence imaging video streams were recorded over laser-illuminated
sample areas. Figure 5c shows three sequential frames on the same sample area, in which
two defocused patterns can be clearly identified. Their different
relative intensities in these frames indicate that the fluorophores
on each nanorod were blinking stochastically. Each bright pattern
in Figure 5c represents
a nanorod. The defocused patterns orient along different directions,
indicating the orientations of the nanorods.54 We found that approximately 70% of the nanorods showed fluorescence
blinking within our measurement time, indicating the presence of Alexa647
dyes in their vicinity. Figure 5d shows fluorescence intensity time traces of two Alexa647–nanorod
hybrids highlighted with squares in Figure 5c. After several digital blinking events,
the fluorescence signals from Alexa647 vanished without recovery,
leaving a strong and steady background of nanorod photoluminescence.
These digital and stochastic blinking events of Alexa647 in the switching
buffer indicated that at most one fluorophore emitted most of the
time. Moreover, the same Alexa647–nanorod hybrid showed large
variations in blinking intensities. This is most likely due to different
labeling positions of Alexa647 with respect to the nanorod. Fluorophores
at different positions experienced different excitation and emission
environments, which led to their different emission intensities. We
estimated the number of fluorophores on the labeled nanorods to be
less than 8 from the discrete intensity levels observed in the fluorescence
time traces. The discrete intensity levels are marked with red dashed
lines (guide to eye) in Figure 5d.

We now compare the defocused pattern due to molecular
emission
and that of nanorod photoluminescence. Thanks to the fluorescence
blinking of Alexa647, photoluminescence and molecular fluorescence
can be distinguished in defocused imaging time sequences. A typical
fluorescence intensity time trace of an Alexa647–nanorod hybrid
is given in Figure 6a. The time trace showed active blinking of signal intensities between
8 × 106 and 107 counts per second. The
blinking amplitude, about 2 × 106 counts per second,
is attributed to Alexa647 molecules on the nanorod. The steady background
of about 8 × 106 counts per second originates from
nanorod photoluminescence. Figure 6b shows the defocused patterns at different time points
highlighted with arrows in Figure 6a. The frame numbers of each snapshot were denoted
next to the red arrows in Figure 6a. Defocused patterns while the molecular emission
was on (frames 45, 144, 240, and 351) are given in the left column
of Figure 6b. The middle
column shows defocused patterns of the nanorod photoluminescence (frames
55, 154, 248, and 363). Subtracting nanorod photoluminescence from
the total signal, the right column in Figure 6b shows the defocused patterns corresponding
to fluorescence emission from Alexa647. We point out that defocused
patterns of molecular emission closely resemble that of nanorod photoluminescence.

Next, we discuss possible reasons that the sequenced images show
almost identical emission patterns in our defocused measurements.
First of all, we exclude the case in which the fluorophores’
transition dipole moments were aligned parallel with the longitudinal
axis of the nanorod. Although tethered onto nanorods, the fluorophores
are able to orientate because of the flexible nature of the conjugations
used as linkers. Therefore, orientations of fluorophores on nanorods
are most likely random instead of being fixed to align with the nanorods.
Second, a few fluorophores are attached onto each nanorod at different
positions, as indicated by blinking events of multiple intensity levels
in Figure 5d and e.
As a result, defocused pattern sequences collect contributions from
fluorophores at different positions. Although the enhanced fluorescence
intensities are strongly biased by the molecule’s relative
orientation and position with respect to the nanorod, all defocused
patterns showed negligible changes along with fluctuations of fluorescence
intensities, indicating that emission patterns observed at far field
were insensitive to the positions and orientations of the emissive
fluorophore. Hence, the identical emission patterns of molecular fluorescence
and nanorods’ photoluminescence observed in our experiment
are most likely due to the antenna coupling of the molecule’s
emission with the nanorod antenna. By efficient and resonant coupling,
the optical antenna dictates the emission patterns from molecular
emitters in its close vicinity.

FDTD on Defocused Patterns
of Dye-Labeled Gold Nanorods
We then apply FDTD numerical
calculations on far-field defocused
patterns of the coupled molecule–antenna hybrid to reveal how
the molecule’s relative positions and orientations influence
the observed defocused patterns. We calculated the defocused patterns
from molecule–antenna hybrids under realistic conditions in
our experiment. We simulated a few representative relative positions
and orientations of the molecule–antenna hybrid system as illustrated
in Figure 7. A point-like
electric dipole, represented using a double-ended arrow in Figure 7, was used to simulate
an emissive molecule. The directions of the arrow represent the dipole
orientation. The electric dipole was placed 5 nm away from the surface
of a gold nanorod at three different locations, the center of the
tip region (position 1), the side of the tip region (position 2),
and the middle of the nanorod’s cylindrical wall (position
3). At each dipole location, five dipole orientations were examined,
0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° in-plane and 90° out-of-plane
with respect to the nanorod. The numerical calculation results are
given right beneath each schematic view of the configurations in Figure 7. It is worth noting
that different color scales are applied in each plot to enhance the
visualization of the defocused patterns. When the molecular dipole
is at the center of the tip and is parallel to the nanorod, the gap
of the defocused fluorescence pattern is aligned along the nanorod’s
longitudinal axis, which resembles the defocused pattern of the nanorod
photoluminescence. However, when changing the orientation of the molecular
dipole, the fluorescence emission pattern alters and the fluorescence
intensity decreases. We notice that the defocused fluorescence pattern
is the most sensitive to the dipole orientation when the molecule
is positioned along the axis close to the tip (position 1 in Figure 7). As shown in the
left column of Figure 7a, a 0° to 90° in-plane reorientation can lead to a 90°
rotation of the defocused pattern and to an intensity decrease by
a factor of more than 600. When the molecule is positioned sideways
close to the nanorod tip (position 2 in Figure 7), a 0° to 90° in-plane reorientation
rotates the defocused pattern by 20° and shows about a 10-fold
difference in intensities. In another circumstance where the molecule
is positioned close to the middle of the cylindrical wall of a nanorod
(position 3 in Figure 7), a 0° to 90° in-plane reorientation results in a 90°
difference in the defocused pattern, but the intensity is reduced
by a factor of 50. It is also worth noting that when the dipole is
90° out-of-plane with respect to the rod, the defocused patterns
possess no feature of the rod, indicating little coupling of the emitter
to the antenna. These simulation results confirm that defocused patterns
strongly depend on emitters’ positions and orientations related
to the nanorod antenna. Moreover, the sensitivity of defocused patterns
on the emitter’s orientation differs at different locations.
When the emitter is located at the center of a nanorod’s tip,
the defocused pattern is most sensitive on the emitter’s different
orientations.

The color scales are normalized to the maximum intensities in each
plot. The arrow represents the location and orientation of the emitter.
The yellow rounded shape indicates the gold nanorod.

Besides the numerical simulations of the emission
process, it is
necessary to take the excitation process into account. This is because
the excitation intensities experienced by molecules in the vicinity
of a nanorod strongly depend on their positions relative to the nanorod.
At the plasmon resonance, a nanorod can create several hundred times
intensity enhancement at the tips along the longitudinal direction.
Therefore, a molecule at the tip region with an orientation parallel
to the nanorod’s longitudinal direction can experience up to
100 times stronger excitation compared to molecules located at the
middle of the cylindrical wall.

The defocused patterns depend
on the molecule’s position
and orientation in two distinct ways. The first one is through the
emission process, where the antenna coupling strongly depends on the
relative positions and orientations of the molecule and the nanorod.
The second one is through the excitation process, which involves the
near-field intensity distributions. In particular, the strongest coupling
configuration, in which a molecule is positioned on the axis and close
to the tip of a nanorod, also gives rise to the strongest excitation
intensity. As a result, such a strongly coupled system produces the
strongest fluorescence signal in defocused imaging, which is several
orders of magnitude stronger than that from other positions and orientations.
In addition, the strong photoluminescence background in our experiment
was almost as strong as fluorescence from the probe molecule. Therefore,
defocused patterns from cases other than the strongly coupled one
are difficult to distinguish even with efficient emitting fluorophores.
Hence, the observed fluorescence is mostly from the emitter that couples
to the nanorod antenna efficiently, which gives a radiation pattern
dominated by the antenna.

Conclusions
In
this work, we demonstrated a novel approach, combining super-resolution
localization, correlative SEM, and defocused imaging, to study molecule–antenna
hybrids at the single-molecule, single-antenna level. Allowing weakly
fluorescent dye molecules to freely diffuse in a viscous medium, sufficient
statistics can be built up to determine the image centroids of in-plane-aligned
molecular–antenna hybrids with a 30 nm resolution using a 2D-Gaussian-approximated
PSF. Correlating super-resolution localization events and SEM micrographs,
we found the individual isotropic centroids located at the geometrical
centers of individual nanorods, while the dyes are supposed to be
excited in the vicinity of the nanorod tips. Moreover, defocused microscopy
on chemically labeled molecule–antenna hybrids unraveled the
dominating role of the nanorod antenna in the coupled molecular emission
to the optical far field. Such observations emphasize the nanorod’s
dual roles to enhance fluorescence signals and to dominate the fluorescence
emission at the far field via efficient coupling.
Our results emphasize the role of plasmonic nanostructures as optical
antennas in the plasmon-enhanced microscopy on a resonantly coupled
optical system. The antenna effects have to be considered in optical
and spectroscopic studies of interactions between molecules and metallic
nanostructures, particularly in super-resolution studies.

Materials and Methods
Gold Nanorod Synthesis
All chemicals
were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. The synthesis was carried
out in Milli-Q water. Seeds: 6.4 mg of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was dissolved in 10 mL of ice-cold water right before use.
A 25 μL amount of 100 mM HAuCl4 was added into 10
mL of 0.1 M CTAB solution. While vigorously stirring the mixture,
we injected 0.6 mL of ice-cold NaBH4 solution, while the
color of the mixture changed from golden to brownish-yellow. After
vigorous stirring for 60 s, the solution was left at room temperature
for 2 h. The nanoparticles of this solution were later used as seeds
to initiate the growth process.

Growth
A 25 μL amount of 100 mM HAuCl4 was mixed with
5 mL of 0.1 M CTAB solution. After addition of various
amounts of 20 mM AgNO3, 27.5 μL of 100 mM ascorbic
acid was added to the growth solution, leading to a color change from
golden yellow to colorless. The final step was to add various amount
of the seed solution into the growth solution. Leaving the solution
at 28 °C, the color of these solutions gradually changed within
60 min.

Sample Preparation for Super-resolution Localization
Microscopy
A 50 μL gold nanorod suspension in 100 μM
CTAB was
spin-coated on a glass coverslide and washed three times to remove
the CTAB. A 30 min UV/ozone treatment followed to further remove the
residues. After the sample was mounted onto the microscope, the nanorods
were immersed into a 500 nM crystal violet solution in glycerol.

Labeling Nanorods with Alexa647
The gold nanorods were
centrifuged and redispersed in a Milli-Q water solution of biotin-terminated
poly(ethylene glycol) (2.5 mM, Nanoscience Instruments). During this
process, the CTAB concentration was kept around 200 μL to prevent
aggregation of gold nanorods. After shaking overnight, Alexa647-conjugated
streptavidin (Life Technologies) was added. The mixture was then kept
for at least 2 h. Afterward, the excess fluorophore in solution was
removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm.

Sample Preparation for
Defocused Imaging on Alexa647-Labeled
Nanorods
The solution was then spin-cast onto a coverslip.
After that, the sample was kept in a sealed chamber filled with switching
buffer, phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), containing oxygen scavenger
(0.5 mg/mL glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 mg/mL catalase (Roche
Applied Science), 10% w/v glucose) and 50 mM 2-mercaptoethylamine.

Single-Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy
Wide-field
fluorescence microscopy was carried out on an inverted optical microscope
(Ti-U, Nikon) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective (NA
= 1.49, CFI Plan, Nikon) and a cooled electron multiplying charge-coupled
device (EM-CCD) camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu). Collimated 644 nm circularly
polarized light from a solid-state laser (Cobolt) was focused at the
back focal plane of the objective as the excitation source. Emission
was collected with the same objective and imaged with the EM-CCD camera
after passing through a dichroic mirror (z633rdc, Chroma) and a long-pass
filter (HQ655LP, Chroma). The image was further magnified 2.5 times
with a camera lens before the EM-CCD camera, resulting in a maximum
field of view of 32.8 μm × 32.8 μm (64 nm ×
64 nm per pixel). The acquisition time was 50 ms.

Data Analysis
Super-resolution localization was done
with a homemade Matlab code. Sample drifts were corrected using the
positions of fluorescent beads in each image frame. For drift correction
of the setup, fluorescent beads that emit constantly in all frames
are used. Because of their strong emission, their positions can be
determined with high accuracy. Applying 2D Gaussian fitting fluorescence
signals, the coordinates of the beads were traced as a function of
time. These trajectories reflect mechanical drifts of the sample during
data acquisition. The sample drift in each frame can thus be deduced
from the mean trajectory of beads, and in this way the coordinates
of fluorescence burst events in each frame can be corrected. The coordinates
after drift corrections were used to reconstruct the single-molecule
super-resolution images. To achieve an accurate drift correction,
the density of fluorescent beads was controlled to guarantee there
are at least several beads in an area of 10 × 10 μm2.

SEM
The sample was coated with a thin gold film using
a JEOL auto fine film coater prior to SEM measurements. SEM micrographs
were recorded using a FEI FEG-250 scanning electron microscope.

FDTD Calculation
The finite-difference time-domain
method was used to numerically calculate the angular distribution
of the far-field scattering of molecular fluorescence in the vicinity
of the gold nanorods (Lumerical Solution Inc., Vancouver, Canada).
The tabled values of Johnson and Christy were used for the dielectric
function of gold.62 The rod was placed
on a dielectric slab with a refractive index of 1.5 (simulating a
glass coverslip). The surroundings were set to a refractive index
of 1.33 to simulate the buffer or a refractive index of 1.47 to simulate
glycerol. A single fluorescence molecule was modeled as an oscillating
electric dipole at 5 nm away from the nanorod surface. To mimic the
image acquisition, a monitor volume was set at the high refractive
index side. The monitor volume was chosen to fully cover the region
from which our objective (NA = 1.49) collects light. In this way,
the Poynting vector (the energy flow) calculated at this monitor volume
simulates the experimentally acquired image. The point spread function
was calculated by conducting a Fourier transform of the Poynting vector
collected on the monitor volume.
