Nanocarbons
show great promise for establishing the next generation of Joule heating
systems, but suffer from the limited maximum temperature due to precociously
convective heat dissipation from electrothermal system to surrounding
environment. Here we introduce a strategy to eliminate such convective
heat transfer by inserting highly stable and conductive microcapsules
into the electrothermal structures. The microcapsule is composed of
encapsulated long-chain alkanes and graphene oxide/carbon nanotube
hybrids as core and shell material, respectively. Multiform carbon
nanotubes in the microspheres stabilize the capsule shell to resist
volume-change-induced rupture during repeated heating/cooling process,
and meanwhile enhance the thermal conductance of encapsulated alkanes
which facilitates an expeditious heat exchange. The resulting microcapsules
can be homogeneously incorporated in the nanocarbon-based electrothermal
structures. At a dopant of 5%, the working temperature can be enhanced
by 30% even at a low voltage and moderate temperature, which indicates
a great value in daily household applications. Therefore, the stable
and conductive microcapsule may serve as a versatile and valuable
dopant for varieties of heat generation systems.

Joule heating,
generated when
an electric current passes through a conductor, has been widely used
in daily applications. As an emerging alternative to conventional
metal-based Joule heater, nanocarbons exhibit distinguished advantages
in robust electrical/thermal conductivity,1−4 high flexibility5,6 and mechanical strength,7 transparency8 and low weight.9 Currently,
there has been a burgeoning interest in employing them, for example,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs),10,11 reduced graphene oxide
(RGO)12 and graphene,13,14 as two-dimensional (2D) flexible heating devices for mild temperature
(less than 100 °C) applications. However, increasing the maximum
temperature at a given voltage or input power remains challenging
due to the excessively and inevitably convective heat dissipation
from the electrothermal system to surrounding environment (Figure 1a). The saturated
temperature was even reported to be depended on the input power and
convective heat-transfer coefficient.14 As such, decreasing the precociously convective heat transfer without
the expense of conductivity, structural integrity and reliability
of the electrothermal system would be the most promising way to solve
the aforementioned problem. Complementation of this seemingly self-contradictory
requirement is heralded as a novel and versatile platform for improving
electrothermal, photothermal, magnothermal and chemothermal conversion
efficiency (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 The role and formation process of C22@GO–CNT microcapsules.
(a) The maximum temperature of Joule heater is always limited by the
inevitably convective heat transfer between electrothermal system
and surrounding environment. (b) C22@GO–CNT microcapsules fill
the space and voids between electrothermal sheets without altering
the degree of sheet orientation and alignment, and thus conserve the
conductance of Joule heating system. The heat released by capsules
can effectively prevent convective heat dissipation, and thus increase
the maximum temperature of the Joule heater. (c) Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of GO sheets, GO–CNT hybrids and as-prepared
C22@GO–CNT microcapsules demonstrate a facile procedure for
the stable and conductive microcapsules. Scale bar: 1 μm.

Due to the relatively high volumetric
heat capacity (>2 J cm–3 K–1)15 and fusion heat (>200 kJ kg–1), the encapsulated long-chain alkanes (CnH2n+2, n ≥ 16)16 have been intensively
studied for fostering rapid, sustainable and reversible heat exchange
between the alkanes and environment. The design of filling up the
space of air with encapsulated alkanes facilitated the realization
of energy-saving buildings and temperature-regulating textiles.17 Yet such a concept has rarely been adopted in
electrothermal systems, because several intrinsic weaknesses of capsulated
alkanes limited their role: (1) large volume change during melting/solidifying
process may cause the shells to rupture, resulting in unstable performance
responsive to the leaked alkanes;18 (2)
inherently low thermal conductivity of alkanes and traditional polymer
shell decreases the heat storage and transfer efficiency;19 and (3) low electrically conductive shells may
impede electron transport through the conductive networks of electrothermal
systems.

A satisfactory answer on the above questions is still
pending, but the microencapsulation of alkanes (e.g., Docosane, C22H46) with graphene oxide/carbon
nanotubes hybrids (denoted as C22@GO–CNT) may offer a solution.
In this design, amphiphilic GO nanosheets, the building blocks of
Joule heating system, act as main candidates of the potentially conductive
microcapsule shell.20Via strong π–π interactions between basal planes,
CNTs effectively reinforce the relatively flexible GO shell and thus
stabilize the capsulated docosane,21,22 as will be
demonstrated below. Additional thermal transport paths within the
microconfined organic matrix are constituted by embedded CNTs in docosane,
which maintains an efficient energy transfer across the CNT/alkane
interface.19 Therefore, the alkanes would
continuously absorb heat from conductive nanocarbon structures23 and release to warm up the surrounding air.
Doping such conductive and stable capsules as a built-in thermal protector
can prevent precocious convective heat dissipation and maintain minimum
conductance degradation of electrothermal structures. We believe this
work will provide a reliable encapsulation technique and ease of operation
for thermal energy utilization.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
of Microcapsules and CNTs Configurations
Figure 1c is a schematic of the formation
steps involved in obtaining our stable and conductive microcapsules.
In brief, the GO–CNT hybrids along with CNT clots (as shown
later in Figure 2j)
were formed under pulsed tip-sonication and then directly applied
in the following ultrasound-induced emulsification with melted C22,
which resulted in C22@GO–CNT microcapsules. At the emulsification
step, the CNT-hybridized GO sheets assemble at the oil/water interface
to stabilize the encapsulated docosane;20 simultaneously the CNT clots are embedded in the oil phase. The
C22/GO/CNT weight ratio can be tailored by changing the concentration
of GO aqueous dispersion and amount of CNTs during the GO–CNT
hybridization. The alkanes can also be extended to other candidates
(n = 16, 18, and 20, Figure S1). We show the narrowly size-distributed C22@GO–CNT microcapsules
prepared with the C22/GO/CNT weight ratio of 500/10/0.2 in Figure S2. They exhibit a smaller size (1.3 ±
0.3 μm) as compared with the ones of emulsions stabilized only
by GO or acidified CNT: C22@GO and C22@CNT (500/10/0, 6.9 ± 1.9
μm; 500/0/10, 2.6 ± 0.6 μm). In contrast to other
GO-based leakage-preventing capsules which were formed via similar emulsion process,24−26 the C22@GO–CNT microcapsules
are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller. It is mainly q result from
the synergistic effect between GO and CNT that accounts for compensating
the large pressure induced from such small and highly curved droplets.27 Raman spectrum of C22@GO–CNT changes
little at GO characteristic peaks at D (∼1350 cm–1), G-bands (∼1600 cm–1),28 C–H stretching mode29 (from alkane) and D/G intensity ratio (1.4), as compared with C22@GO
(Figure S3). However, the 2D-band intensifies
to >2.5 times and is broadened toward that of pristine CNTs (2700
cm–1), which confirms the presence of CNTs within
the capsules.

microcapsules. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ultrathin
sections from ultramicrotomy showing (a) the CNTs are completely adhered
on GO layers, (b) partially adhered and partially inward extended,
and (c) even led to clots embedded in C22, respectively. (d–f)
Schematic models of the three configurations of CNTs within C22@GO–CNT
microcapsules. The gray lamellar and yellow wires represent the GO
sheet and CNTs, respectively. TEM images of GO–CNT hybrids
in bright field imaging mode (g) and high-angle annular dark-field
imaging mode (h) are shown. Individual CNT covered by GO sheets is
demonstrated, with some uncovered parts (white dashed circle) and
wrinkled structures (white arrows) detected. Molecular dynamics simulation
of the “GO–CNT” assembly show side view (i, top)
and tilted top view (i, bottom) of a snapshot during the relaxation
process. The wire-like nanotube and silk-like GO can be distinguished.
Additionally, a CNT clot (j) is adhered by GO sheets. Scale bar: (a–c)
500 nm; (g and h) 50 nm; (i) 5 nm; (j) 200 nm.

Detailed observations at the sections of ultramicrotomed
C22@GO–CNT unclosed the multiform CNTs in microcapsules: completely
horizontal adherence on GO layers (Figure 2a,d), partial adherence and partial inward
extension (Figure 2b,e), and clot attached to the inner wall of capsules (Figure 2c,f). The heterogeneous configurations
of CNTs within the microcapsules will be discussed later in this paper.
Upon removal of encapsulated C22 and the topside of some capsules,
such randomly distributed configurations could be further confirmed
in Figure S4 where the multiform CNTs were
located mainly in void spaces of original encapsulated alkanes. On
the basis of the experiment result, the length of CNTs ranges from
to tens of nanometers to a few micrometers, but a preferable configuration
of them inside microcapsules was not available, as we have adjusted
GO/CNT weight ratio at 10/0.01, 10/0.1, 10/0.2, and 10/1 (not shown
here). Comparison of the energy required for completely horizontal
adherence on GO (ECNT–GO) and perfect
embedment within C22 (ECNT–C22)
supports the observation, yet also reveals the short CNT is more likely
completely adhered by GO via π–π
interaction,21,22 whereas the long one prefers
interaction with C22 (Supporting Information Note 1).

Evidence is shown that the multiform CNTs in microcapsules
originate from the ultrasound-assisted hybridization of nanocarbons.
The ultrasonic treatment of GO and CNT mixture leads to the adherence
of CNTs on GO sheets and random-oriented wrinkled structure which
can be discovered in magnified images (Figure 1c and Figure S5). The adherence process was detected by tracking the blue shift
of GO C=C stretching vibration absorption (from 1642 cm–1) with time (Figure S6).
The shift suggests an enhanced electron delocalization, in other words,
a more compact π–π stacking structure formed between
GO and CNT.30 After 15 min, the ultrasound-assisted
assembly was believed to reach a saturated state because the peak
was fixed at 1623 cm–1. Figure 2g shows that the aromatic conjugation helps
in the formation of “GO–CNT” assemblies by covering
the surface of an individual CNT by one side of GO layers,31,32 which contributes to the horizontal adherence of CNTs on GO layers.
On the basis of the image, the width of wrinkles can also be estimated
to be 3–5 nm. In comparison, the sonicated GO sheets without
CNTs only possess wrinkles wider than 200 nm (Figure S7). As such, the adherent CNTs are likely to induce
the buckling effect on the basal plane of GO. If the CNTs are shorter
than the persistence length (about 200 nm),33 they behave as a rod and completely adhere on GO layer (Figure 2d). It is difficult
to bend them because the bending energy is large enough to prohibit
their peeling off from the GO layer. From the view of GO layers, the
bending stiffness can be expressed as34 1  where B is the bending stiffness of the GO layer, E is
the Young’s modulus of the GO layer, and ν is the Poisson’s
ratio. For monolayer GO that interacts with CNTs, the Young’s
modulus E is around 200 GPa, and the thickness t is 0.7 nm.35 The exact value
of Poisson’s ratio is not known, but can be supposed to be
0.165 as the value for graphite in the basal plane.36 Thus, the adhesion strength of CNT on wrinkled GO layers
can be calculated as37 2  where L is
the width of wrinkle (5 nm, Figure 2g). Using these values, one can estimate F is in the order of 10–9 N. If the layer has been
compressed a few nanometers, the work W done by this
force is in the order of 10–18 J, which is in agreement
with the reported effective adhesion energy between CNT and GO (−500
kJ/mol).38 As such, the CNT-hybridized
GO shells are reinforced at a planar direction,39 resulting in highly stable encapsulated alkanes in the
following repeated melting/solidifying process.

Meanwhile, the
uncovered CNT can be detected adjacent to the covered ones (Figure 2h). It holds a great
possibility for this part to form the second configuration of CNTs
during the emulsification. In addition, we conducted molecular dynamics
simulation of the “GO–CNT” assembly to probe
the forming mechanism of the heterogeneous configuration of CNTs on
GO sheets (Figure 2i). Indeed, the relaxation process reveals that the aromatic conjugation
can only allow CNTs to be partially adhered on wrinkled GO basal planes,
which is in good agreement with the experimental observation. The
partial coverage is common among the CNTs longer than the persistence
length; they are modeled as semiflexible chain with configuration
of partially adhering on GO layer and partially penetrating into the
interior (Figure 2e).40 In this case, it is difficult to fix them totally
on GO because they tend to occupy more space to obtain larger configurational
entropy. In addition, CNT clots with averaged diameter as large as
600 nm were also found, even at a lower (10/0.01) or higher (10/1)
weight ratio (Figure S8). GO layers only
catch them by adhering on a limited numbers of peripheral CNTs (Figure 2j). CNT clot, a self-aggregated
assembly, is highly undesirable and causes difficulties in solution
processing41,42 but, if handled properly, would
be beneficial in enhancing heat transfer efficiency within the microcapsules.

Stability and Heat Transfer of C22@GO–CNT
By introducing
GO–CNT hybrids in emulsification, the C22@GO–CNT microcapsules
show a distinguished stability. As depicted in Figure 3a and Figure S9, the original shape of C22@GO–CNT solid powder was retained
at the temperature higher above the melting point of docosane, whereas
the unprotected docosane deformed into liquid quickly, and there was
also obvious leakage from C22@GO and C22@CNT capsules. More details
about the thermal stability of microencapsulated alkanes were examined
with thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative TG (DTG) analyses. Figure 3b presents that docosane
mass percentage of C22@GO–CNT is maintained at around 80%,
which is slightly lower than that of the other two kinds of microcapsules.
However, DTG curves (inset Figure 3b) demonstrate that the thermal stability of alkanes
can be improved by microencapsulating in the hybridized shell because
C22@GO–CNT exhibits the highest temperature (260 °C) of
maximum weight loss rate. Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was employed to confirm that there is little change in C22@GO–CNT
thermal properties after 100 thermal cycles (Figure 3c). The average latent heats of docosane
have remained around 240.8 J/g, leading to an encapsulation ratio
of alkane as high as 96.7% by comparing with the enthalpy of bulk
state.43 As far as we know, it is the highest
value comparing with other reported microencapsulated alkanes,26 indicating a timely and sufficient structural
change of C22 in response to temperature change. Figure 3d also confirms this by unveiling
no notable subcooling circle of C22@GO–CNT even at a high cooling
rate (10 °C/min). Subcooling is common among the low thermal
conductive materials where solidification occurs below its melting
temperature.44 The effect of confinement
can be ruled out because the sizes of the examined capsules are all
at range of 1–10 μm. Although the interfacial thermal
conductance45 between alkane and CNT is
relatively low due to the large mismatch in phonon spectra,46 the embedment of individual and clot-shaped
CNTs can enhance the heat transfer within the microcapsules and provides
nucleation sites for crystallization by molecular interaction.19

Figure 3 Thermal stability measurement of microcapsules. (a) At
duration of 30 min, the shape changes of C22@GO and C22@GO–CNT
at around 50 °C are shown. No detectable leakage was observed
for C22@GO–CNT capsules. TG (b) and DTG (inset) curves of bulk
C22, C22@GO, C22@CNT, and C22@GO–CNT are demonstrated. The
TG curve of C22@GO–CNT in decreasing process exhibits two-step
weight loss that, respectively, corresponds to decomposition of alkanes
(200–300 °C) and degradation of carbon shells (400–500
°C). A postponed decomposition was obvious by comparing with
other samples. DSC curves (c) of C22@GO–CNT at 10th, 50th,
and 100th thermal cycle were obtained at the rate of 5 °C/min.
During the measurement, the melting and crystallizing points varied
slightly. DSC curves (d) of bulk C22, C22@GO, C22@CNT, and C22@GO–CNT
at the rate of 10 °C/min are displayed. The subcooling circle,
delayed structural change, happens at C22@GO, C22@CNT, and bulk C22
in between 37 and 40 °C.49,50

Fabrication of Planar C22@GO–CNT/GO Composites
The
high ζ-potential of C22@GO–CNT microcapsules at around
−46 mV ensures a homogeneous distribution in constructing C22@GO–CNT-doped
composites. Aside from this dispersibility, C22@GO–CNT can
resist a high pH value even at 7 and maintain the stability of emulsion
shape (Figure S10), which is easily understood
as reinforcing role of CNTs on GO shell to neutralize the pH-induced
increase of hydrophilicity.20,26,47 Next, vacuum filtration of colloidal dispersions of GO and C22@GO–CNT
microcapsules yielded free-standing planar C22@GO–CNT/GO composites
with tailored thickness and composition, denoted as x-C22@GO–CNT/GO where x represents percentage
volume concentration of the microcapsules in colloidal dispersions
(Figure 4a and Figure S11). A top-view of 25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
reveals the wrinkled but closely packed GO layers fully cover the
capsules (Figure 4b).
Meanwhile, some stripped-off layers of 25-C22@GO–CNT/GO unveil
that the capsules are embedded at basal plane of GO sheets (Figure 4c). The GO simultaneously
as shell materials of capsule and building blocks of electrothermal
system enables C22@GO–CNT to homogeneously dope, resulting
in the “built-in” structure. After reduction, an LED
can be illumined at 1.8 V when connected with the reduced planar composites
(Figure 4d). Moreover,
the evenly doped structure renders the reduced 25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
(r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO) composite an almost intact flexibility
as compared with the undoped one (Figure 4e), which cannot be obtained by the conventional
composites of solid alkanes and nanocarbons.48

Figure 4 Planar
C22@GO–CNT/GO composites. (a) SEM image of cross sections of
free-standing planar composites is shown. The composite was made up
by vacuum filtrating aqueous mixture containing 25% of C22@GO–CNT
microcapsules and 75% GO in concentration. The top-view of the composite
(b) shows the microcapsules fully covered by GO sheets. Several layers
were stripped off the planar 25-C22@GO–CNT/GO. (c) High-resolution
SEM shows the capsules are embedded at basal plane of GO sheets, resulting
in a “built-in” structure. (d) An LED lamp was illumined
when r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO was connected between clips. And so
were the other composite containing 0–100% C22@GO–CNT
microcapsules. (e) A rC22@GO–CNT/GO composite remains flexible
when the C22@GO–CNT concentration is below 50%. Scale bar:
(a) 10 μm; (b and c) 1 μm.

Joule Heating Performance of Reduced C22@GO–CNT/GO Composites
The completely encapsulated alkanes have little effect on the overall
conductance of the Joule heating system in the repeated melting/solidifying
process. As shown in Figure 5a, the electrical resistivity of the rx-C22@GO–CNT/GO
composites with dopant below 25% remains 2.0 × 10–2 Ω·m at 25 °C. This indicates a threshold doping
value for incorporating our microcapsules without disturbance of conductive
pathway of GO sheets (Figure 1b). As a function of temperature, the electrical resistivity
of all reduced composites demonstrated the steadily decrease (by less
than 2 times) as the temperature was increased to 80 °C, and
recovered when the composites were cooled down (Figure S12). Notably, there are only weak peaks observed during
the phase transition of docosane (42–46 °C). Beyond the
phase transition region, the conductive structure of the composites
was stabilized, and thus, less change in electrical resistivity was
detected. In comparison, a graphite/hexadecane mixture without encapsulation
was reported to have a 2 orders of magnitude change of conductivity
due to the internal stress generated during the phase change.18 Furthermore, r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO demonstrates
similar temperature-dependent electrical resistivity curves at the
first and 100th thermal cycle (Figure 5b), suggesting an excellent thermal stability within
the range of expected working temperatures.

and electrothermal performance of rC22@GO–CNT/GO composites.
(a) The resistivity of rC22@GO–CNT/GO composite varies with
the volume concentration of C22@GO–CNT. (b) As a function of
temperature, the resistivity curves of the 1st and 100th thermal cycles
change slightly, indicating the conductive structure is stable. (c)
Temperature evolution curves of r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO under constant
voltages of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 V. (d) As a function of voltage, the
balanced surface temperatures obtained at 20 min heating are demonstrated.
The samples of r5-C22@GO–CNT/GO, r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO,
50-C22@GO–CNT/GO, and neat rGO heater were studied. (e) A collection
of temperature evolution curves of r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO composite
and neat rGO heater under 6 V repeated for 100 cycles.

Being exposed to air (22 °C) and subjected
to convective heat dissipation, rx-C22@GO–CNT/GO
composites were examined for surface temperature evolution under voltage
of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 V (Figure 5c). In comparison with neat rGO, r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
composite exhibits the enhanced maximum temperature of 30.4, 39.7,
56.2, 70, and 82.8 °C with increased voltage (Figure S13). The maximum temperature can be further improved
by generally 30% through decreasing the dopant to 5% in our recent
system (Figure 5d and Figure S14).). This means the microcapsules quickly
balance the temperature discrepancy with heating source and release
heat to environment, even at moderate temperature. It has a great
value in mild-temperature applications, for example, incubation, planting
and brewing. Finally, the heating and cooling processes of r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
composite under high voltage value can be repeated for 100 cycles
without notable degradation (Figure 5e and Figure S15). The composite
maintains an around 10% enhancement in maximum temperature. Regarding
the encapsulated alkanes, evidence is shown with r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
composite (Figure 5c) where phase change regions of docosane can be clearly distinguished
when the temperature is heated up above the melting range. We prepared
a control sample by removing docosane from r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
composite (Figure S16). Now, the sample
possesses a comparable supporting framework and electrical conductivity
(1.9 × 10–2 Ω·m) as r25-C22@GO–CNT/GO
but only slightly enhances the maximum temperature as compared with
neat rGO (Figure 5d).
At the confined space within the hybridized capsule shell, alkanes
act as heat reservoir with capacity 3 orders of magnitude higher than
air (1.2 × 10–3 J cm–3 K–1). As such, more heat can be simultaneously accumulated
and released to eliminate the convective heat dissipation.

Conclusions
A novel strategy for the elimination of precociously convective
heat dissipation from electrothermal system using highly stable and
conductive encapsulated long-chain alkanes was demonstrated. The traditional
well-encapsulated long-chain alkanes always required the formation
of thick polymer shell26 which would mitigate
the energy transfer efficiency by a retarded thermal/electrical conductance.
In our design, the multiform CNTs within the GO–CNT hybridized
microcapsules can maintain the integrity of encapsulation during the
repeated heating/cooling process, and meanwhile facilitate the quick
heat exchange between the microconfined alkanes and environment. As
such, a combination of multiple advantages is realized in one single
capsule which sets our work apart from previous microcapsules for
heat utilization. The work is virtually applicable to a wide variety
of organic molecules that can be encapsulated in our hybridized nanocarbon
shell, opening new avenues for approaching the targeted performance
by selecting materials with different heat capacity and thermal conductance.
With the application of our microcapsules, exciting opportunities
may arise from enhancing solar-heat transfer efficiency at regions
lacking sunlight, for example, northwest England. In addition, given
the unique existence of multiform CNTs, the underlying principle and
more derived complex structures hold great promise for smart heater
and signal transmitter spanning multiple length scales.

Methods
GO–CNT Hybridization and Ultrasound-Induced
Emulsification for C22@GO–CNT Microcapsules
For C22@GO–CNT
microcapsules (C22/GO/CNT = 500/10/0.2), 5 mL of GO aqueous solution
(2 mg/mL) was tuned by chloride acid to pH = 2, followed by adding
0.2 mg of MWCNTs. The sonicator probe end was placed just below the
surface of the liquid (about 0.5 cm into solution), and the mixture
was pulse-sonicated (Model Q700, 20 kHz; Qsonica) for 10 min (amplitude:
30%, 5 s on, 5 s off) in open environment with a 1.8 cm diameter titanium
probe (model BS 2d18F). Upon completion of sonication, the temperature
of reaction mixture may reach around 60–70 °C. Then, 500
mg of docosane was added directly onto the as-prepared GO–CNT
hybrids dispersion. The temperature was maintained at around 45 °C
until the docosane was completely melted. Then, the sonicator probe
end was placed at the interface of docosane and water, and the mixture
was continuously sonicated for 3 min (amplitude: 30%, ∼1000
J). During the sonication process, the reaction temperature was maintained
at around 45 °C by circulated water. Upon completion of sonication,
the reaction product was cooled by ice–water mixture and stored
in room temperature for following applications. The as-prepared emulsions
remained stable for more than 2 months without any evidence of leakage
(Figure S1).

Characterization
SEM analysis was conducted using a JSM-7001F Scanning Electron Microscope
from JEOL. GO–CNT hybrids were investigated using a JEOL 2100FCs
with a Schottky Field Emission Gun TEM (200 kV accelerating voltage).
For ultramicrotomy, samples were embedded in LR White Acrylic Resin
(TAAB L012/L010) and cold cured in either an embedding mold or gelatin
capsules. Ultrathin section (70–80 nm) were cut on a Leica
UC6 and viewed at 120 kV in a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit. Raman spectra
were measured by the Renishaw InVia Raman microscope with a 532 nm
laser, a 50× objective lens and 1 mW (0.5%) as incident laser.
TG and DTG use a microbalance model STA PT1000 from Linseis where
the samples were heated at 5 °C/min from 25 to 800 °C in
a stream of N2. DSC was conducted using a calorimeter model
Q20 from TA Instruments. Normally, samples were heated and cooled
at 5 °C/min from 0 to 80 °C in a sealed nitrogen atmosphere.
For fast thermal scan, the heat and cool rate could be up to 10 °C/min.
The resistivities of the planar composites were investigated using
a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent B1500). A four-point (Van
Der Pauw) configuration was used to determine the resistivity of the
film from 25 to 80 °C. To characterize electrothermal performance,
a thermal sensor (VR105864, Vernier) was adhered on the surface of
a Joule heater to measure the temperature change. Temperature variation
of the sample was recorded by a data acquisition system (LabQuest2)
through the connected thermal resistor and transmitted to personal
computer. The composites were connected to two copper sheets along
the flat direction using conductive silver glue to ensure good contact
between the composites and copper electrodes. The samples typically
had areas of 5 × 5 mm2. A workstation (Keithley 2400
Soucemeter) was linked to the samples through copper electrodes. The
samples were directly exposed to environment. A variety of potentials
generated from the workstation were applied to the sample for about
20 min to enable temperature increase. Electro-to-heat testing cycles
were performed by applying and removing the voltage (2, 3, 4, 5, and
6 V) repeatedly at about 30 min for each cycle.
