Ag29 nanoclusters capped
with lipoic acid (LA) can be doped with Au. The doped clusters show
enhanced stability and increased luminescence efficiency. We attribute
the higher quantum yield to an increase in the rate of radiative decay.
With mass spectrometry, the Au-doped clusters were found to consist
predominantly of Au1Ag28(LA)123–. The clusters were characterized using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy at the Au L3-edge. Both the extended absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) and the near edge structure (XANES) in combination
with electronic structure calculations confirm that the Au dopant
is preferentially located in the center of the cluster. A useful XANES
spectrum can be recorded for lower concentrations, or in shorter time,
than the more commonly used EXAFS. This makes XANES a valuable tool
for structural characterization.

nanoclusters are a class of materials with properties such as discrete
energy levels, strong luminescence, and potentially atomic monodispersity.1,2 This is due to their small size, of several hundred atoms or less.
The properties of clusters depend on their exact composition and may
be affected by changing one atom for an atom of another metal. Bimetallic
clusters offer ways to explore fundamental properties of clusters,
in addition to a vastly greater range of parameters that can be tuned
to obtain clusters with desired properties. The addition of a second
metal can drastically enhance the quantum yield,3 which is of great importance for many potential applications
such as sensing4 and bioimaging.5 With two metals it is also possible to tune the
composition and structure of the cluster surface which may be beneficial
for catalysis.6 The small size and high
monodispersity of clusters allows one to understand the changes in
optical and electronic properties at the single-atom level.7 Bimetallic clusters with Au and Ag can be prepared
by doping the well-known Au clusters Au25, Au38, and Au144 with Ag8−10 or by introducing Au in Ag clusters
such as Ag25 and Ag44.11,12

We have previously studied Ag clusters with composition Ag29(LA)123–, where LA is the ligand
lipoic acid.13 These clusters are water-soluble,
stable for many months, and show bright red luminescence. Recently,
Mishra et al. showed that doping of these clusters
with Au is possible, yielding preferentially Au1Ag28 clusters with enhanced quantum yield.14 In this work we further study the changes in Ag29(LA)123– cluster properties upon doping
with Au. In agreement with previous work, we find that high concentrations
of Au destabilize the cluster, but with a few % Au, a stable bimetallic
species is formed, identified as Au1Ag28(LA)123– with mass spectrometry. Small amounts
of Ag29 are still observed, but the contribution of clusters
with a higher number of Au atoms is negligible. We further find that
the bimetallic cluster has a higher quantum yield than the monometallic
cluster, with blueshifts in both emission and absorption spectra.
Studies of the luminescence lifetime indicate that doping with Au
causes an increase in the rate of radiative decay, which explains
the higher luminescence efficiency for a constant nonradiative decay
rate.

An important question is the location of the Au atom.
Dopants may occupy different sites in clusters, and knowing the location
of dopant atoms is necessary to rationalize changes in cluster properties,
such as stability.15 However, determining
which sites are preferentially occupied can be challenging. A number
of cluster structures have been determined with X-ray crystallography,
and this technique can also be used for bimetallic clusters. An example
is the determination of the location of Au atoms in Au12Ag32, the bimetallic counterpart of the well-known cluster
Ag44.12 However, growing crystals
may be challenging for instance due to the structure and flexibility
of the ligand.16 Even if crystals are obtained,
there is no guarantee that all species in the sample crystallize,
and for this reason it is possible that only a subpopulation of the
sample is probed.17 An alternative technique
is X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XAS does not require crystalline
samples but can be done using disordered solids or solutions. Furthermore,
it is element-selective, meaning it can be used to study only the
dopant, and purification to remove excess salts or ligands is not
necessary. XAS can give information about the electronic structure
and local geometry of the absorber, including the nature of ligands,
their coordination number, and bond lengths.18−20 An X-ray absorption
spectrum is divided into two regions; the extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES).
EXAFS analysis and interpretation is well-established and can be used
to determine bond lengths and the nature of neighboring atoms with
high accuracy. It has been successfully used in the study of bimetallic
clusters, for example, to determine the preferential position of dopants
in Au25(SR)18 clusters, where SR indicates the
thiolate ligand.8,21 XANES is less straightforward
to interpret and may require comparison to reference spectra of compounds
with known structure, together with calculations of spectra for expected
structures.22,23

In this study, we present
XAS at the Au L3-edge of Au-doped Ag29 clusters
in solution, using high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD).
Only a narrow band of the emission peak is integrated using a spectrometer
with Bragg optics. The integrated bandwidth is narrower than the core-hole
lifetime which results in a sharpening of the spectral features compared
to XAS recorded in transmission mode or using standard fluorescence
detection.24 Sharper features make it easier
to distinguish similar samples. From EXAFS, we find Au–Ag and
Au–S coordination numbers that are in good agreement with the
Au atom preferentially occupying the central position of the Ag cluster.
The low Au concentration of the bimetallic clusters (∼30 μM)
and requirement for spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio can make
EXAFS time-consuming, with a detrimental effect on radiation-sensitive
samples. We therefore also recorded XANES. We show that XANES can
also be used to identify the dopant location, by combining the experiments
with first-principles calculations of Au in different sites. The results
confirmed the central position of the Au dopant in the Ag29 clusters. A reasonable XANES spectrum could be recorded in 1/50
of the time it took to record EXAFS. Thus, while XANES is less quantitative
than EXAFS, it can provide the required information while minimizing
exposure of the sample to X-rays.

Results and Discussion

Properties of Au-Doped Ag Clusters
The bimetallic clusters
are made according to the same protocol as Ag29 clusters,
by replacing some of the AgNO3 solution with HAuCl4 solution. UV–vis absorption spectra of samples with
low Au concentrations show blueshifts of all absorption features compared
to pure Ag29. A marked increase in luminescence intensity
is also observed, along with a slight blueshift of emission wavelength
and a decrease in near-infrared (NIR) emission. The reproducibility
of the synthesis is not as high as for pure Ag29 clusters;
therefore, to ensure the accuracy of the observed trend, multiple
samples were prepared and emission spectra of all were recorded. Optical
properties of bimetallic clusters are summarized in Figure 1, and additional spectra can
be found in Figure S1. The percentage of
gold is given in mol %. Optical properties are in good agreement with
what was recently reported by Mishra et al.(14) for the same clusters, though no change in shape
or position of emission peak was reported in that case.

Figure 1 Optical properties
of Ag29 clusters doped with Au. (a) UV–vis absorption
spectra for samples with 0, 2.9, 14% Au. (b) Emission intensity as
a function of Au concentration, relative to a pure Ag29 sample. Different plot markers represent samples prepared on different
days. The yellow line is the average value for all samples. (c) Normalized
emission spectra (excited at 400) and (d) photograph of clusters with
0, 2.9% Au under UV light.

The quantum yield of clusters with 2.9% Au was determined
to be 7.9%, when excited at 485 nm. This is more than 3 times higher
than that of pure Ag clusters. Upon excitation at 550 nm, a significantly
lower quantum yield of 1.7% is measured. This may be explained by
the presence of nonluminescent species which give rise to a background
absorption that is more prominent at 550 nm. Additionally, the sample
may contain a fraction of pure Ag29 clusters, which are
predominantly excited at 550 nm due to the blueshift in absorption
wavelength upon doping with Au.

There appears to be an optimal
Au concentration of around 3–5%, above which the emission intensity
decreases again. We attribute the initial increase in intensity and
blueshifts in absorption and emission to the incorporation of Au into
the Ag29 cluster, giving a general cluster formula AuyAg29–y. The decrease in emission can then be explained if no stable
clusters with high y are formed. This is also apparent
from the absorption spectra. For 0–7.1% Au, there is a smooth
blueshift and decrease in absorbance. At around 14% Au, absorption
features are less pronounced, and they disappear entirely at even
higher Au concentrations, instead showing only a single broad absorption
feature, typical for larger nanoparticles.

The optimal Au concentration
lies slightly below that reported by Mishra et al. (8%14) and far below that found for the
organosoluble cluster Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)43– (BDT, 1,3-benzenedithiol; TPP,
triphenylphosphine)17 where up to 40% Au
was used in the synthesis, resulting in a 26-fold enhancement in quantum
yield. Au-doped Ag29 with BDT also showed a blueshift in
absorption, but the emission spectrum was red-shifted. For Ag25(SR)18–, the incorporation of
a single Au atom resulted in a blueshift both in absorption and in
emission.11

Luminescence Lifetime
The room temperature luminescence lifetime of the clusters was
found to decrease with increasing Au doping, from around 4 μs
for pure Ag clusters to 2.6 μs for clusters with 14% Au, see Figure S3. As the pure Ag and Au-doped clusters
absorb and emit at different wavelengths, we expect to see some variation
in the luminescence decay with wavelength as this probes different
species. This effect is especially noticeable at 4 K. At low temperatures,
the nonradiative decay rate decreases resulting in longer lifetimes
and higher luminescence intensity. Blueshifts in absorption and excitation
wavelength are also more easily observed as the spectral broadening
decreases upon cooling.

A series of emission spectra at different
excitation wavelengths was recorded at 4 K and is presented in Figure 2 as a 2D map. For
3.6% Au, the sample shows four features; two at emission wavelength
660 nm and the others at 675 nm. The latter two have excitation wavelengths
that are in good agreement with room temperature excitation and absorption
spectra of pure Ag clusters. Indeed, a similar 2D map recorded of
pure Ag clusters show that these features originate from Ag29 (see Figure S4). The two additional features
present in the 3.6% Au sample, with excitation wavelengths 400 and
460 nm and emission wavelength 660 nm, thus originate from AuyAg29–y clusters. As both have the same emission wavelength, it is likely
that the sample contains only one other species in addition to Ag29.

Figure 2 (a) 2D emission and excitation map of clusters with 3.6% Au, recorded
at 4 K. The two emission peaks at 675 nm are from Ag29,
see Figure S4. (b) Luminescence decay curves
at 4 K of clusters with 0 and 3.6% Au. Emission and excitation wavelengths
are, respectively, 490 and 680 nm (blue and gray, A) and 460 and 640
nm (yellow, B). A and B thus correspond to mostly Ag29 and
mostly AuyAg29–y, respectively. Solid lines are triexponential fits
to the data. Luminescence lifetimes at other wavelengths can be found
in Figure S5.

Luminescence decay curves of clusters with 3.6% Au at 4 K
are shown in Figure 2, for two different emission and excitation wavelengths, together
with a measurement of pure Ag clusters. The decay curve of pure Ag29 is similar to that of a 3.6% Au sample emitting at 680 nm
and excited at 490 nm. These wavelengths correspond to the emission
feature assigned to Ag29. When excitation and emission
wavelengths of 460 and 640 nm are used, corresponding to the AuyAg29–y cluster, the decay is significantly faster. The luminescence
decay shows multiexponential behavior for bimetallic clusters but
also for pure Ag29 clusters. This does not necessarily
mean there are multiple emitting species. Different environments or
conformations of the emitter can influence the rates of decay, leading
to an ensemble of emitters with different luminescence lifetimes.25 There may, for example, be small differences
in ligand coordination. While the data may be fitted with multiple
exponentials, interpretation of the fit may not be straightforward.
Pre-exponential factors and lifetimes are correlated, meaning there
may be many possible solutions, which can be hard to distinguish from
each other especially if the signal-to-noise ratio is low.26 Furthermore, the small, finite number of luminescence
lifetimes obtained from such a fit may not accurately reflect the
shape of the entire distribution actually present in the sample.

The luminescence decay curves at 4 K were fitted with two or three
exponentials, with the latter yielding slightly better fits. The triexponential
fits are shown in Figure 2, and fit parameters are given in Table S1. The 3.6% Au sample at AuyAg29–y excitation
and emission wavelengths (460 and 640 nm) shows shorter lifetimes
and different pre-exponential factors suggesting an overall distribution
of faster decay. For further analysis, we calculated the average lifetimes
according to .25 This equation removes the need for
fitting. Pure Ag clusters have an average lifetime of 100 μs.
With 3.6% Au, the lifetime at these excitation and emission wavelengths
(490 and 680 nm) is 78 μs, while it decreases further to 45
μs at 460 and 640 nm. Average lifetimes at other wavelengths
are given in Figure S5. Shorter average
lifetimes coincide with wavelengths preferentially probing the AuyAg29–y clusters. However, even at wavelengths where we expect mostly
Ag29, the average lifetime is shorter than for pure Ag
clusters, meaning there is probably still some AuyAg29–y absorbing and emitting due to the overlap of broad emission and
excitation peaks. The luminescence spectra of the two types of clusters
cannot be separated, and it is therefore not possible to conclusively
determine the average lifetime of pure AuyAg29–y.

Overall,
the luminescence of noble metal clusters remains rather poorly understood,
and the changes in luminescence behavior upon doping even more so.
Ligand-to-metal charge transfer has been proposed as a mechanism for
the luminescence of Au25(SR)18–, which showed increased quantum yield with strongly electron-donating
ligands.27 Such a charge transfer mechanism
was also suggested for Au clusters with glutathione28 and monodoped M1Ag24(SR)18 clusters, where the dopant was located in the center of the cluster.29 The dopants (Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au) were found
to give different quantum yields which could be related to electron
affinity of the dopant and bond lengths from the capping units to
the icosahedral core of the clusters. Both factors could influence
the ligand-to-metal charge transfer. In contrast, theoretical studies
of the luminescence of Au25, Ag25, and Au1Ag24 found that luminescence involves only superatomic
orbitals of the cluster and charge-transfer states are not involved.30,31

Nevertheless, we can qualitatively explain some of the differences
in luminescence behavior between our Ag29 and AuyAg29–y clusters. Upon doping with Au, the quantum yield increases
and the luminescence lifetime decreases. This is in contrast to Au1Ag24(SR)18– and Au-doped
Ag29 clusters capped by BDT.11,17 In both these
cases, a higher quantum yield and a longer lifetime were observed
upon incorporation of Au. This suggests different mechanisms may be
responsible for the increase in quantum yield upon doping Ag clusters
with Au and may depend, for example, on the exact nature of the ligands
or structure of the cluster.

The lifetime is the inverse sum
of all rates of decay from the excited state, which we group into
one overall radiative rate kr and one
overall nonradiative rate knr. The quantum
yield of a system is defined as the ratio between emitted and absorbed
photons or, alternatively, the ratio between kr and kr + knr. For Au1Ag24 and Au-doped Ag29 with BDT, a decrease in nonradiative decay rate is consistent with
experimental observations. A decrease in nonradiative decay rate means
that a larger fraction will decay via the radiative
pathway. A recent study of rod-shaped Au25 clusters showed
that, when they were doped with Ag to give Ag13Au12, the quantum yield increased significantly which was attributed
to stabilization of the LUMO and enhanced rigidity of the cluster.32 With increased rigidity, vibrational and rotational
motion can be suppressed which decreases the nonradiative decay. This
phenomenon is known from organic molecules as aggregation-induced
emission33 and has also been demonstrated
for clusters.34 In contrast, the changes
in luminescent behavior we observe upon doping our Ag29 clusters with Au are consistent with an increase in radiative decay
rate. This results in shorter luminescence lifetimes and an increase
in quantum yield. Both our Ag29 and AuyAg29–y clusters have long
microsecond luminescence lifetimes which are characteristic for spin-forbidden
transitions.35 This selection rule can
be relaxed through spin–orbit coupling,36 which is stronger for heavier elements such as Au.37

Composition of Bimetallic Clusters
Optical spectroscopy points to one dominant Au-doped cluster species.
Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to determine
the size of the Au-doped clusters and confirm the successful incorporation
of Au. From our previous experiments, it is known that the pure Ag
clusters are Ag29(LA)123– with
near atomic monodispersity.13 The overall
charge state of the cluster can be different from 3– due to
deprotonation of the ligands, each of which has a carboxylic acid
group. Species in the overall 3–, 4–, and 5–
charge states are observed. They are deconvoluted in Figure S7. Regardless of the overall charge state, similar
spectra are observed. For further analysis, we consider only the species
in the overall 5– charge state, as these ion signals are the
most intense. This species has two deprotonated ligands. The other
10 ligand carboxylate groups can have either H+ or Na+ counterions. This H+/Na+ exchange results
in multiple species in the same charge state with a mass difference
of 22 Da. The full composition of Au-doped Ag29 clusters
in the overall z = 5– charge state can therefore
be written as [AuyAg29–y(LA)123– – (2 + x)H+ + x Na+]5–, where y is
between 0 and 29 and x can have values between 0
and 10. The individual isotope signals for each species with different x are not observed but overlap to form a broad peak. The
spacing between two adjacent broad peaks is Δm/z 4.4, which corresponds to 22 Da in the z = 5– overall charge state. The mass difference
upon Ag/Au exchange is 89 Da, which is nearly identical to that of
4 H+/Na+ exchanges. This means we expect significant
overlap between spectra of Ag29 and AuyAg29–y.

Figure 3 shows
mass spectra of clusters with 0, 2.9, and 7.1% Au as well as theoretical
spectra of Ag29, Au1Ag28, and Au2Ag27 with all possible H+/Na+ exchanges (different values of x). Spectra of a
larger range of samples are shown in Figure S6. It is clear from the spectra that the sample with 2.9% Au contains
mostly Au1Ag28. There is a small amount of Ag29 visible (first four ion signals, m/z 1120–1143) and no contribution from Au2Ag27 (as seen by the lack of intense ion signals in the
region m/z 1187–1200). For
samples with 7.1% Au (on average 2.1 Au atoms per cluster), we again
observe mostly Au1Ag28 with minor contributions
of Ag29 and Au2Ag27. Even with 14.3%
Au, the cluster Au1Ag28 dominates the spectrum,
despite the average composition being Au4Ag25 (see Figure S6). There appears to be
a preference for monodoped clusters, as previously observed by Mishra et al.(14)

Figure 3 Mass spectra, in the z = 5 overall charge state, of samples with 0, 2.9, and
7.1% Au, which corresponds to average compositions of Ag29, Au0.8Ag28.2, and Au2.1Ag26.9, respectively. Theoretical spectra of Ag29, Au1Ag28 and Au2Ag27 are shown in lighter
colors for comparison. Note that the most intense ion signals of the
7.1% Au sample are not explained by the average composition Au2Ag27. Theoretical spectra are calculated for the
compositions [AuyAg29–y(LA)123– – (2 + x) H+ + xNa+]5–, where x is
between 0 and 10. The spacing between peaks corresponds to H+/Na+ exchange, and individual isotope signals are not
resolved. See also Figure S6.

To estimate concentrations of each cluster in a
sample is challenging due to the overlapping ion signals. Experimental
spectra are therefore fitted to a weighted sum of theoretical spectra,
for each combination of x and y with
the assumption that each cluster has the same distribution of Na+ adduct peaks. Full details of the fitting model can be found
in the Supporting Information and the results
are summarized in Figure S8. We find that
all samples show a higher concentration of Au1Ag28 relative to Ag29 and Au2Ag27 than
would be expected if Au was distributed randomly across all clusters.
Note that a preference for monodoped clusters during synthesis may
be further enhanced by high stability of Au1Ag28 compared to Ag29 and Au2Ag27 during
purification prior to mass spectrometry measurements or during cluster
ionization. The less stable clusters suffer more degradation, and
the resulting species may remain undetected, much like degraded Ag29.13

Postsynthesis Modification
The standard synthesis protocol involves addition of metal salts
to a solution of LA (made soluble by reduction), followed by reduction
to form clusters. Both the pure Ag and the bimetallic clusters appear
to follow the same synthesis pathway: after reduction, the solution
turns black, then slowly lightens during the next hours until it is
a reddish orange color. A second way to prepare the bimetallic clusters
is by postsynthesis modification of pure Ag clusters. This is done
by addition of HAuCl4 to a previously prepared Ag29 sample, followed by reduction with NaBH4. The sample
then darkens and turns brown, but after several hours of stirring
the orange color returns. UV–vis absorption spectra show that
the final sample has similar absorption features as Au-doped Ag clusters
prepared according to the standard procedure (Figure S9). When only HAuCl4 (or only NaBH4) is added, there is only a slight change in absorbance but
no shift in absorption wavelength, proving that both reagents are
needed for successful conversion.

Based on the redox potentials
of AuCl4–/Au and Ag+/Ag, one
would expect a redox reaction to occur and Au to be incorporated into
the cluster in a galvanic exchange reaction when only Au3+ is added. This was observed in the synthesis of thiolate-protected
Ag7Au6 clusters, which were made from Ag7 and Ag8 by adding AuCl4–.38 However, the small size of the clusters
and the presence of ligands can influence such reactions. An anti-
galvanic exchange reaction was observed for Au25(SC2H4Ph)18, which reacted with Ag+ to form bimetallic species such as Ag2Au23 and Ag3Au22,39 although
the reaction did not occur when glutathione was used as a ligand.40 Interestingly, Bootharaju et al. found that the only way to prepare monodisperse Au1Ag24(SR)18– clusters was by galvanic
exchange, using Ag25(SR)18– and Au3+.11 A direct synthesis
from Ag and Au salts gave instead a range of alloy clusters AuyAg25–y(SR)18–, as also demonstrated
in a number of other studies.41,42

Au-doped Ag29 clusters prepared via postsynthesis modification
also show a preference for monodoped clusters. Due to the two reduction
steps with NaBH4, the Na+ concentration is higher
than usual in this sample giving intense Na+ adduct signals
(see Figure S10). The preference for monodoping
with gold, both via a direct synthesis and postsynthesis
modification, appears to be specific for Ag29 with LA.
For BDT-capped Ag29, direct synthesis with Au yielded a
distribution of different compositions with 1–7 Au atoms, although
one that shows a preference for clusters with a low number of dopants.17 Doping with Pt yielded only a small fraction
of Pt1Ag28 when direct synthesis was done.43 For Au-doped Ag25, direct synthesis
also resulted in a mixture of clusters with different number of Au
atoms, while the monodoped cluster was only obtained via postsynthesis modification.11

Stability
of Bimetallic Clusters
We further find that doping with gold
increases the stability of the Ag29 clusters. This was
demonstrated by exposing samples with 0, 2.9, and 7.1% Au to UV-light,
as shown in Figure S11. Over time, the
characteristic absorption features disappear for all samples, but
bleaching is fastest for the pure Ag clusters. The pure Ag sample
showed only a slight blueshift of the absorption features (3 nm).
With 2.9 and 7.1% Au, the blueshifts were 13 and 6 nm, respectively.
The large blueshift observed for the 2.9% Au sample can be explained
by the different stabilities of the species present in this sample;
Ag29 and Au1Ag28. The pure Ag clusters
are bleached more rapidly than Au1Ag28. Thus,
over time, the relative concentration of Au1Ag28 increases and its blueshifted absorption features dominate the spectrum.
The difference in stability between pure Ag and Au-doped clusters
was also observed when 0 and 7.1% Au clusters were exposed to heat
by placing samples on a hot plate for several hours.

An increase
in stability was also found for BDT-capped Ag29 upon doping
with Au or Pt.17,43 Similarly, Pt1Au24,44 Pd1Au24,45 and Au1Ag2411 were found to be more stable than their monometallic
counterparts. Alloying Au25 with Cu, on the other hand,
reduced the stability of the clusters.46 This is attributed to the small size of Cu (atomic radius 1.28 Å)
compared to Au (1.44 Å), which leads to distortions of the structure.
It has also been observed that Au–Ag alloy clusters are less
stable than pure Au clusters.9 This can
be explained by bond strengths, which in bulk are found to be Au–Au
> Au–Ag > Ag–Ag.47 Conversely,
doping a Ag cluster with a small amount of Au will introduce a number
of strong Ag– Au bonds.

Location of the Au Atom
The bimetallic clusters were further studied with X-ray absorption
spectroscopy to determine the position of the Au atom in the bimetallic
cluster. EXAFS of a 2.9% Au sample was recorded without any additional
purification or concentration. Mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy
do not exclude the presence of small Au–LA complexes or clusters
in the samples after synthesis, and the lack of purification ensures
all Au species are taken into account. Due to the low Au concentration
in the samples (30 μM), multiple EXAFS spectra were recorded
over a total time period of 4 h. The cluster solution was placed in
a liquid jet setup so that the same fraction of sample was not continuously
exposed to X-rays. Despite the use of this setup, radiation damage
was observed, resulting in a color change of the sample from orange
to brown and a disappearance of prominent UV–vis absorption
features (see Figure S13). The radiation
damage, and its effect on XAS, will be discussed in more detail later.

For a first analysis, the radiation damage was ignored and all
EXAFS scans were averaged. The averaged spectrum was fitted to two
scattering paths, one Au–S and one Au–Ag. The spectrum
is shown together with the fit in Figure 4. The results of the fit are given in Table 1. The Au–Ag
coordination number, 7.8, is significantly higher than the average
Ag–Ag coordination number in pure Ag29, which is
around 3.48 Clearly, the Au atom does not
occupy a random position in the doped cluster. We assume that the
clusters have a similar structure as Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)43–, which is a reasonable assumption
as cluster composition and optical properties are similar.48 The structure of this cluster is shown in Figure S12. There are four different sites the
Au atom may occupy; in the center of the icosahedron (center), on the outer icosahedral positions (ico), in
the capping units, bound to LA (shell), and on the
external positions bound only to phosphines (ext).
Note that the LA-capped clusters do not have the phosphines, so these
sites may not exist with the same coordination geometry. The lack
of phosphines may also distort the rest of the surface, giving slightly
different coordination numbers for shell sites. Expected
coordination numbers can be found in Table 2.

was done using scattering paths Au–S and Au–Ag of Au1Ag28 using the structure of Ag29 with

the outer positions of the icosahedron (ico). The
contributions of each path are also shown in part b. The results of
the fit are given in Table 1. For this figure, all EXAFS scans are averaged together (even
though we observe some radiation damage).

a CN is the coordination

Debye–Waller factor, and E0 the
energy shift. The fit is shown in Figure 4. For this fit, the R-factor
= 0.024 and reduced χ2 = 48. The amplitude reduction
factor is not taken into account (i.e, S02 = 1) for the
values in the table. From fitting of the Au reference, it was estimated
to be between 0.95 and 1.0.

a Only Au–Ag bonds shorter than 3 Å are considered, except
where explicitly noted.

b These bonds are slightly longer, around 3.1.

The Au–Ag coordination number of 7.8 can only
be explained if a significant fraction of Au occupies a center or ico position. Furthermore, we observe an Au–S
bond length of 2.29 Å, which is shorter than the 2.46 Å
Ag–S bond present in pure Ag29 clusters.48 It is, however, consistent with typical bond
lengths of Au–S bonds in Au clusters49,50 and gold thiolates.51 Thus, Au in shell or ext sites would cause a significant
surface distortion. The observed Au–S bonds may be present
in Au clusters or Au-thiolate complexes, rather than in Au1Ag28.

From color changes, and by comparing UV–vis
absorption spectra before and after EXAFS, it is clear that there
is radiation damage. Radiation damage is ubiquitous and may seriously
affect the recorded spectrum and thus the interpretation of the experimental
data.52 It is of great importance to determine
the effect of radiation damage on the X-ray spectrum and at which
time scale this occurs, as this determines how long a sample may be
measured before changes in the electronic structure of the absorber
occur. The X-ray beam may induce chemical changes of the sample at
sites that are far from the X-ray absorber.53 If these changes do not measurably modify the electronic structure
around the absorber, the sample is considered intact with respect
to the X-ray spectroscopy measurements. Therefore, the best probe
to study radiation damage in XAS is XAS itself. To monitor the radiation
damage, XANES was recorded every 25 min between EXAFS scans. There
are minor changes in XANES over time, most notably a decrease in whiteline
intensity (see Figure S13). The change
is observed already within 1 h and stabilizes after 2 h. The first
half of the scans, 0–2 h, represents a relatively undamaged
sample, while the effect of radiation damage is more severe in the
2–4 h range.

It is possible to get a better understanding
of the damage process and thus by extension the undamaged sample,
by comparing the first and second half of the EXAFS scans (Figure S14). Due to the lower signal-to-noise
ratio when only half the scans were considered, fitting was more challenging
and in some cases required the use of constraints for parameters of
the Au–S scattering path. The first half of the scans could
also be successfully fitted using only the Au–Ag scattering
path. In the first half of the EXAFS scans, the Au–Ag coordination
number is around 10, while in the second half it decreases to around
7. In contrast, the Au–S coordination number shows a slight
increase to around 1.5 in the second half. Radiation damage thus either
causes the Au to migrate to the surface of the cluster or results
in cluster degradation yielding gold thiolate species. The high Au–Ag
coordination number before extensive radiation damage shows a strong
preference for Au in the center site, in the middle
of the cluster.

EXAFS requires high-quality spectra with high
signal-to-noise ratio, which may take a long time to record. XANES
presents an intriguing addition to EXAFS for the analysis of bimetallic
clusters to determine dopant location. It has lower detection limits
than EXAFS which allows for the study of dilute samples. It is less
critical for the spectra to have high signal-to-noise ratio, making
it beneficial for the study of radiation-sensitive compounds. XANES
is sensitive to the number and identity of ligands as well as that
of next-nearest neighbors. A downside is that the analysis is less
straightforward than for EXAFS.

Au L3-edge HERFD-XANES
was recorded between EXAFS scans to monitor radiation damage, but
we can also use these XANES scans for further analysis. It took only
5 min to record a spectrum with good signal-to-noise ratio, as shown
in Figure 5. The spectrum
shows a strong whiteline and a number of well-resolved postedge features.
The spectrum was compared to first-principles calculations of Au in
possible sites of Ag29 (see Figure S12 for the used structure). Mass spectrometry identified Au1Ag28 as the major species in the sample with 2.9%
Au, so this composition was used for the calculations. The agreement
with the calculated spectrum of Au1Ag28 is excellent
when Au occupies the center position. Both EXAFS
and XANES lead to the same conclusion. However, radiation damage is
significantly less severe for XANES. As discussed previously, radiation
damage causes a decrease in whiteline intensity, as shown in Figure S13. The 5 min HERFD-XANES spectrum presented
in Figure 5 was recorded
well within the time scale for the damage, which becomes noticeable
after 30–50 min. During the 5 min it took to record XANES,
no changes are observed in the spectral features. Thus, XANES measurements
in combination with calculations identify the location of Au in the
cluster with considerable less required measurement time than EXAFS.
This allows to mitigate the problem of radiation damage considerably.

Figure 5 Experimental
Au L3-edge HERFD-XANES of Au-doped Ag29 clusters
(2.9% Au), together with results of FDMNES calculations for an Au
atom in each of the four possible locations in Ag29.

The spectrum in Figure 5 was recorded using the same
resolution as for EXAFS (1.8 eV). The resolution could be improved
further to 0.5 eV, but this also reduced the intensity of the signal.
No novel features were observed with the improved resolution (Figure S15).

As a further demonstration
of the usefulness of XANES, we also calculated spectra of Au doped
in another silver nanocluster, Ag25(SR)18, which
has an icosahedral core surrounded by six Ag2(SR)3 units.54 Spectra of Au occupying different
positions in this cluster (Figure S17)
are markedly different. Furthermore, spectra of Au in the center of
Ag25 and Ag29 are comparable, probably due to
the similarity in structure of the inner icosahedral core in both
clusters. It may therefore be unnecessary to know the exact structure
of the cluster and arrangement of ligands on the surface to gain useful
knowledge about the location of dopants. Samples containing a mixture
of doped clusters could be analyzed using linear combination analysis,
principal component analysis, or more advanced fitting procedures,
using experimental or calculated spectra of each species.23

A preference for monodoping in the center
of clusters is also observed for Pd15 and
Pt21 in Au25. The monodoped
Au1Ag24 cluster, prepared via postsynthesis modification, also has the Au atom in the center of
the cluster.11 Monodoping can be rationalized
when a cluster doped in the center position exhibits
a significantly higher stability than a cluster with dopants in other
locations, or an undoped or multidoped cluster. The Au–Ag bond
is stronger than the Ag–Ag bond.47 When an Au atom occupies the center position in
Ag29, the number of Au–Ag bonds is maximized, which
explains the preference for center doping. In Au
clusters, alloying with Ag results in Ag at ico sites
in Au258,42 and similar sites in Au144.55,56 Doping Ag44 clusters with Au
has been shown to result in clusters with composition Au12Ag32. This cluster consists of a hollow icosahedral core
(12 Au atoms) surrounded by a dodecahedral shell (20 Ag atoms) and
six Ag2(SR)5 capping units.12 The Au atoms do not occupy the capping units nor the metal
shell immediately below, just as for our Au1Ag28 clusters. Clearly, ico sites are more favorably
occupied by Ag than Au. We further propose that Au atoms cannot go
into the capping layer of Ag29 (shell and ext sites) as this would result in significant structural
distortions and thus a lower stability due to the change in bond length
from Ag–S to Au–S. Indeed, changes in capping unit metal
are rare in AgAu alloy clusters.57 In BDT-capped
Ag29, it was found that also the ext sites
could be replaced with Au,17 but the presence
of phosphines may help stabilize these doped clusters due to the strong
Au–P bond.58,59

Conclusions
The
introduction of dopants is a promising method for tuning nanocluster
properties. In this article, the effects of introducing Au into Ag29(LA)123– clusters were investigated.
Au atoms could be incorporated both via direct synthesis
or by postsynthesis modification, with both methods yielding clusters
with similar properties. Doping with Au resulted in enhanced stability
to heat and UV-light. The optical properties of the cluster were also
affected, with blueshifts in both absorption and emission spectra.
We further observed an increase in quantum yield by a factor of 3–4
and a decrease in luminescence lifetime from 4 to 2.6 μs. Together,
these observations indicate an increase in radiative decay rate for
the doped cluster which is explained by lifting the spin-selection
rule by enhanced spin–orbit coupling upon doping with the heavier
Au. The optical properties suggest the presence of a single type of
Au-doped Ag29 species. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
measurements confirmed that doped samples contain predominantly Au1Ag28(LA)123–. X-ray
absorption spectroscopy was used to determine that the Au atom occupies
the central position in the cluster. We show that XANES may be used
in addition to EXAFS for the identification of dopant locations. We
propose that clusters with Au atoms located on surface sites would
cause structural distortions and therefore be less stable. This may
explain the strong preference for monodoped species.

Methods
Chemicals
AgNO3 (laboratory
reagent grade) was obtained from Fisher Scientific. NaBH4 (99%), (±)-α-lipoic acid (≥99%), methanol (≥99.9%),
and HAuCl4·3H2O (≥99.9%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Butanol (99.5%) was obtained from Acros. Water
was of Milli-Q quality, purified using a Millipore Direct-Q 3 water
purification system. 4-(Dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran
(DCM dye) was obtained from Exciton.

Synthesis
The
synthesis of the Ag clusters is based on a protocol by Adhikari et al.(60) and the same as our
previously reported protocol for the synthesis of Ag29 clusters.13 Bimetallic clusters are prepared using the same
general protocol. In total, 19 mg of lipoic acid (92 μmol) and
7 mg of NaBH4 (185 μmol) were placed in a 40 or 20
mL glass vial with 14 mL of water. This was stirred (using a magnetic
stirring bar) until all LA had dissolved. Next, 25 mM AgNO3 and HAuCl4·3H2O solutions were added,
with a combined volume of 700 μL (corresponding to 17.5 μmol
in total). For many of the experiments, 20 μL of HAuCl4 solution was used, corresponding to 2.9% Au. The AgNO3 solution was always added first, and the addition of HAuCl4·3H2O was followed by 10 mg of NaBH4 (264
μmol) in 2 mL of water. The vial was wrapped in aluminum foil
to minimize the exposure of the clusters to light, and stirring was
continued overnight. The synthesis was performed at room temperature.

Postsynthesis modification was done by preparing Ag29 according to the standard procedure. After a day, 25 mM HAuCl4·3H2O solution was added to a total Au concentration
of 2.9 or 7.1%, followed by the addition of 10 mg of NaBH4 in solid form. The solution was then stirred overnight. All samples
were stored in the dark at room temperature

Optical Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda
950, a PerkinElmer Lambda 40, or a Varian Cary 50 spectrometer. Room
temperature emission spectra were recorded with a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer
or a 450 W xenon lamp and a Spex 1680 (0.22 m) spectrofluorometer
for excitation and an Acton Research SpectraPro 300i monochromator
with a liquid N2 cooled Princeton Instruments CCD camera
for detection of emission spectra. The CCD camera was equipped with
a 150 lines/mm grating blazed at 800 nm. Emission spectra were corrected
for the spectral response of the equipment. Emission and excitation
spectra at 4 K were recorded using an Edinburgh Instrument FLS920
spectrofluorometer, with a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier as detector
and a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The setup was equipped
with an Oxford Instruments cryostat for liquid helium. Room temperature
luminescence lifetimes were recorded using a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier
with a time-correlated single photon counting card (TimeHarp 260 PC,
PicoQuant), and Nd:YAG laser (third harmonic at 355 nm) pumped Optical
Parametric Oscillator (OPO, Opolette HE 355-II, Opotec Inc.) operating
at 500 nm giving ∼10 ns pulses or a 441 nm pulsed diode laser
(Edinburgh Instruments EPL-445, 65 ps pulses) as the excitation source.
At low temperature, luminescence lifetimes were recorded with a slightly
modified version of this setup. A Hamamatsu H7422 photomultiplier
was used as detector, and the OPO laser operating at 420, 460, or
490 nm was used as the excitation source. For optical spectroscopy
measurements, the clusters solution was diluted 4–10×
with water; the dilution was the same when comparing different samples
for the same experiment.

Quantum Yield Determination
The
quantum yield of pure Ag and Au-doped Ag clusters was determined using
DCM dye in ethanol as reference. A Varian Cary 50 spectrometer was
used to record UV–vis absorption spectra. Emission spectra
were recorded on a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer. The excitation
wavelengths used were 485 and 550 nm. Clusters and DCM dye were diluted
with water or ethanol to prepare five samples with absorbance ≤0.1
at 485 nm. The integrated emission intensity of each spectrum scales
linearly with the absorbance at 485 nm (see Figure S2); the slopes of the lines are proportional to the quantum
yield. The quantum yield of DCM dye in ethanol is 43.5%.61 The quantum yield of the clusters can be calculated
according to eq 1, 1  where m is the slope from Figure S2, n is the solvent refractive index, and
Φ is the quantum yield. In each case, the subscript R refers
to the reference dye. Values for the solvent refractive index are n = 1.33336 and nR = 1.3611
for water and ethanol, respectively.62

Stability Tests
The stability of clusters solution to UV-light
was tested by placing samples by a UVP UVGL-58 hand-held UV-lamp (365
nm excitation wavelength, 6 W) while minimizing the influence of other
light sources. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded at regular
intervals. To test the stability against heat, pure Ag clusters and
Au-doped Ag clusters were placed together on a hot plate at 80 °C
for 6 h.

Mass Spectrometry
MS measurements were performed in
negative ion mode using an electrospray ionization-time-of-flight
(ESI-TOF) instrument (LC-T; Micromass, Manchester, U.K.) equipped
with a Z-spray nanoelectrospray ionization source. A nano ESI quadrupole
TOF instrument (Micromass, Manchester, U.K.) was used for tandem mass
spectrometric analysis. Needles were made from borosilicate glass
capillaries (Kwik-Fil, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL)
on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA), coated with a thin
gold layer by using an Edwards Scancoat (Edwards Laboratories, Milpitas,
CA) six Pirani 501 sputter coater. After purification, the sample
was sprayed into the mass spectrometer. The applied voltage on the
needle was between 1200 and 1100 V, and the sample cone voltage was
varied between −7 and 0 V. All spectra were mass calibrated
in negative ion mode, using an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid
(0.1% v/v). All samples were purified using 1-butanol to extract water,
containing excess ligands and other possible contaminants, in several
steps until the clusters sediment, after which they are washed with
a small amount of methanol and redispersed in water. Details are given
in the Supporting Information. Theoretical
spectra were calculated using ChemCalc63 for the compositions [AuyAg29–y(LA)123– – (2 + x) H+ + xNa+]5–, where x is
between 0 and 10.

X-ray Spectroscopy
Au L3-edge XAS (11.92 keV) was recorded at beamline ID26 at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The incident beam was selected using
the (111) reflection from a double Si crystal monochromator. The spectrometer
was equipped with a set of five Ge(555) analyzer crystals (R = 1000 mm, r = 50 mm) to record high-energy
resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS. The 2p3d fluorescence
channel was monitored (Lα1, 9.71 keV) for all experiments.
The overall energy bandwidth was ∼1.8 eV, which is well below
the core-hole lifetime broadening of 5.54 eV.64 A further improvement of the energy resolution to 0.5 eV was obtained
by using the (311) reflection of the monochromator, removing one of
the analyzer crystals (as this particular crystal had a slightly lower
quality than the others) and by placing a mask with radius 25 mm in
front of each of the four remaining analyzer crystals. Only XANES
was recorded with these settings, as the higher resolution also results
in a lower intensity (these XANES spectra are shown in the Supporting Information). A liquid jet setup was
used to minimize radiation damage. The sample (2.9% Au, prepared at
5× the standard scale) was placed in a vial from which liquid
was pumped through a capillary to form a free-standing liquid jet
which was placed in the focus of the beam. Below the jet, the liquid
was collected and returned to the vial.

EXAFS Analysis
EXAFS analysis was done using VIPER65 and
the Athena and Artemis software packages.66 Scattering phases and amplitudes were calculated using FEFF for
Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4,48 with TPP (triphenylphosphine) ligands removed and BDT (1,3-benzenedithiol)
replaced by LA. A geometry optimization of this structure was done
in Avogadro,67 keeping Ag and S atoms frozen,
to ensure reasonable C–C and C–H bond lengths and angles.
One of the Ag atoms in the icosahedral shell was replaced by Au to
model an average environment with both Au–Ag and Au–S
paths that were used in the fit. Typical fit parameters were k = 3.0–12.0 Å–1, R = 1.15–3.3 Å, using a Hanning
window (dk = 1 Å–1) for the
Fourier transformation. Fitting was done using k =
3 weighting in VIPER and k = 1, 2, 3 weighting in
Artemis. The amplitude reduction factor S2 was not explicitly taken into account during fitting (i.e., S2 = 1 was used). However, from fitting
a reference Au sample, it may be estimated to be between 0.95 and
1.0.

XANES Analysis
The experimental spectrum was compared
to calculations using FDMNES.68 The structure
of the cluster was taken from that of Ag29 protected with
BDT,48 modified in the same way as described
above for EXAFS analysis. The FDMNES calculations were done for an
Au atom in each inequivalent site in Au1Ag28(LA)12. A radius of 6 Å was used for each calculation.
This corresponds to the distance from the central atom to the outer
Ag atoms. Atomic potentials, Fermi level, and charge transfer were
calculated self-consistently, and the finite difference method was
used to calculate potentials.69,70 Spin–orbit interactions
were included in the calculation for core and valence state with the
keyword relativism. The spectra were convoluted to
apply an energy-dependent broadening, using default parameters (an
arctangent function). The width of the core-hole was decreased to
0.50 eV and further broadened with a 1.0 eV Gaussian, to better match
the experimental data. Additional calculations were done of an Au
atom in different sites of Ag25(SR)18–, using the experimentally determined structure without any modifications.54
