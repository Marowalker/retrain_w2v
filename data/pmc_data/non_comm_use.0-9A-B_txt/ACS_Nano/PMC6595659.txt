Recent
approaches in the treatment of cancer focus on involving
the immune system to control the tumor growth. The administration
of immunotherapies, like checkpoint inhibitors, has shown impressive
results in the long term survival of patients. Cancer vaccines are
being investigated as further tools to prime tumor-specific immunity.
Biomaterials show potential as adjuvants in the formulation of vaccines,
and biomimetic elements derived from the membrane of tumor cells may
widen the range of antigens contained in the vaccine. Here, we show
how mice presenting an aggressive melanoma tumor model treated twice
with the complete nanovaccine formulation showed control on the tumor
progression, while in a less aggressive model, the animals showed
remission and control on the tumor progression, with a modification
in the immunological profile of the tumor microenvironment. We also
prove that co-administration of the nanovaccine together with a checkpoint
inhibitor increases the efficacy of the treatment (87.5% of the animals
responding, with 2 remissions) compared to the checkpoint inhibitor
alone in the B16.OVA model. Our platform thereby shows potential applications
as a cancer nanovaccine in combination with the standard clinical
care treatment for melanoma cancers.

==== Body
The recent
reports about the
increase in the overall survival of cancer patients treated with immunotherapeutics,
in particular checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell transfer, and chimeric
antigen receptor T cells, rekindled the interest in the development
of prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccines.1−3 Biomaterials
are currently being investigated for the formulation of micro- and
nanoparticulate vaccines that enable the co-delivery of antigens and
adjuvants.4,5 Alternatively, biomaterials have been exploited
in drug delivery systems for immune checkpoint inhibitors, including
microneedles, scaffolds, micro- and nanoparticles, and platelets.6−10 Furthermore,
the materials themselves may present immunogenic properties leading
to the stimulation of toll-like receptors and danger associated molecular
pathways, and consequently to the activation of antigen presenting
cells (APCs).11 Among the biomaterials
assessed, porous silicon (PSi) micro- and nanoparticles promote the
maturation of immature dendritic cells (DCs) to a mature phenotype,
with a shift in the cytokine profile toward a Th-1 biased profile,
enabling the priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.12−14 The semi-synthetic
modification of the biocompatible polymer dextran with acetal groups
yields a pH-sensitive polymer characterized by immunostimulatory properties.15,16 Thermally oxidized PSi (TOPSi) nanoparticles and acetalated dextran
(AcDEX) formulated into a nanocarrier by nanoprecipitation in glass
capillary microfluidics induced the activation of peripheral blood
monocytes in vitro, showing a potential application
as a biomaterial-based platform for cancer vaccines.12

One of the reasons behind the failure of many vaccines
in clinical
trials is the choice of the antigenic component: Tumor associated
antigens (TAAs) or cancer-testis antigens are expressed also by other
healthy tissues, thus the likelihood of depletion of highly reactive
T cells by central tolerance to avoid autoimmunity is high.2,17,18 On the contrary, tumor-specific
antigens, or neoantigens, are derived from point mutations and are
expressed only in cancer cells.19,20 The possibility of
eliciting a stronger immune response is thereby higher upon stimulation
with neoantigens compared to TAAs.21 Recently,
vesicles derived from the membranes of cancer cells were proposed
as an alternative source of antigens and neoantigens for the formulation
of cancer vaccines.22 The advantage of
using this antigenic source resides in the multiplicity and complexity
of the antigens delivered to the APCs.23 We have previously investigated the feasibility of this antigenic
source in vitro, in a multistage delivery system
composed of a core made of adjuvant biomaterials, which was further
coated with a layer of cell membranes (cancer cell membranes, CCM)
by extrusion through a polymeric membrane.12

The immunosuppressive environment of the tumor microenvironment
may reduce the potency of the immune response evoked by a therapeutic
vaccination.24 To tackle this problem,
we hyphothesized that a biohybrid vaccination platform (Scheme 1) should synergize with checkpoint
inhibitors, such as CTLA-4 blocking antibodies. For this reason, we
focused on the improvement of the immune infiltration and antigen-experience
of T cells through an enhanced activation of APCs in the tumor surroundings.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that a combinatorial therapy between our
nanovaccine and an anti-CTLA4 antibody can enhance the efficacy of
the vaccination due to the mechanism of action of the checkpoint inhibitor
on the central regulation of the T cell activation. In this study, we assess the nanovaccine and the combination of anti-CTLA4
antibody administered concurrently with the vaccination on the efficacy
of the treatment and on the priming of the immune response in vivo. We first evaluated the efficacy of the vaccination
alone on the growth of an aggressive melanoma murine model, investigating
also the changes in the immune profile at the tumor site. Subsequently,
we assessed the synergistic potential of the combinatorial therapy
with the immune checkpoint inhibitor on the growth of established
tumors and on the infiltration of activated immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Multistage Nanovaccine Platform
A PSi core (porous brown core)
was encapsulated within a layer of AcDEX (light blue) using glass
capillary microfluidics. Then, the nanoparticles were enveloped by
a layer of cancer cell membrane (CCM; autologous with the tumor model
evaluated, B16.F10 or B16.OVA; white layer).

Results
Tumor
Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles: Cytocompatibility and Immunostimulatory
Properties
We first evaluated the cytocompatibility of the
system, tumor-membrane-coated (TOPSi@AcDEX@B16.OVA) nanoparticles
(NanoCCM), onto an immortalized murine immune cell line, JAWS II,
as such or in the presence of two different concentrations (1 and
10 μg/mL) of the murine anti-CTLA4 antibody. The formulation
was assessed in a range of concentrations from 25 to 500 μg/mL
for 24 h. As shown in Figure 1A, after 24 h, NanoCCM particles are highly cytocompatible
over the whole range of concentrations assessed, inducing a slight
cell proliferative effect, as reported also in previous works.5,12 The incubation of the nanovaccine together with the checkpoint inhibitor
at the concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/mL did not alter the safety
profile of the formulation. Thereby, we selected the concentration
of 1 μg/mL of anti CTLA-4 antibody for further in vitro studies. After 48 h, the particles induce a dose-dependent decrease
in the cellular viability for the highest concentrations assessed
(250 and 500 μg/mL).

are cytocompatible
and induce the maturation of murine APCs in vitro. (A) Cell viability (%) of JAWS II cells incubated with the tumor-membrane-coated
TOPSi@AcDEX nanovaccine (NanoCCM) for 24 h (left) and 48 h (right),
as such or in the presence of two different concentrations of a murine
anti-CTLA4 antibody. Cells incubated in 10% medium and in Triton X-100
1% represent the negative and positive controls. (B) Percentage of
CD80, CD86, and double positive JAWS II cells after 48 h (top) and
72 h (bottom). JAWS II cells were incubated with APC antimouse CD80+ antibody or PerCP-Cy 5.5 antimouse CD86+ antibodies,
and the expression of the receptors was evaluated by flow cytometry.
The cells were incubated with NanoCCM at the concentration of 100
μg/mL for 48 and 72 h. Cells incubated with medium and cells
incubated with LPS represent the negative and positive controls, respectively.
The results are expressed as mean ± SD (n >
3) and were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test.
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and
***p < 0.001.

In the following assay, we assessed the immunostimulatory
properties
of the nanovaccine by incubating the nanoformulation, at the concentration
of 100 μg/mL, with JAWS II and, subsequently, analyzing the
activation profile of the cells from the expression of co-stimulatory
signals (CD80 and CD86). As shown in Figure 1B, the nanovaccine, after 48 h of incubation,
stimulated the expression of CD86 to levels comparable to those of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), proving the ability of the formulation to
induce the maturation of APCs. The inclusion of the checkpoint inhibitor
does not change the level of CD86 presented by the cells. The peak
of the immunostimulatory effect of the formulation is reached at 48
h, and at 72 h, there is a decrease in the expression of the receptor,
when compared to LPS, while still being significantly higher than
the control in medium. As for the expression of CD80, at 48 h, there
is no difference among all the samples, while for 72 h, the nanosystems
present levels of expression even lower than the negative control.
However, at 48 h, the incubation of the cells with NanoCCM resulted
in a significant increase in the number of double positive cells,
when compared to LPS. When the checkpoint inhibitor was added, the
percentage of double positive cells decreased. After 72 h, the immunostimulating
effect of the NanoCCM formulation fades, when compared to LPS. Interestingly,
in the presence of the ICI, the cells displayed a higher percentage
of double positive cells compared to the nanosystem alone. Moreover,
we evaluated the mechanism of activation of APCs by determining the
effect of the particles on the secretion of TNF-α by human peripheral
blood monocytes; the effect of the cytokine was studied by co-culturing
the medium of peripheral blood monocytes with Ramos Blue. As presented
in Figure S1, only TOPSi NPs induce the
secretion of TNF-α, while when the particles were encapsulated
within the polymeric layer and then enveloped within the CCM, there
was no secretion of TNF-α. These results are in agreement with
what was previously reported elsewhere.12,13

Moreover,
we evaluated the ability of the nanovaccine to mediate
the cross-presentation of antigens to MHC-I. As presented in Figure S2, the incubation of JAWS-II cells with
NanoCCM (wrapped with membrane derived from B16.OVA cells and spiked
with SIINFEKL-cell penetrating peptide, CPP) induced the presentation
of SIINFEKL on MHC-I. The cell membrane vesicles alone induced the
cross-presentation, while the JAWS-II cells incubated with the polymer
alone did not present any SIINFEKL peptide. Next, we investigated
the possibility that the presence of the cell membrane wrapped around
the particles could induce a partial cross-dressing with the APCs.
For this, we prepared CCM and NanoCCM samples wrapped with the membrane
of a BALB/c cell line (4T1). JAWS-II cells (C57BL/6 lineage) were
pulsed with these formulations, and we assessed the percentage of
the MHC-I H-2Kd molecule presented on the cells. As shown in Figure S3, the incubation with both CCM and NanoCCM
results in a partial cross-dressing of the membranes. Finally, to
clarify the vaccination mechanism of the biohybrid nanovaccine, splenocytes
derived from OT-I mice were incubated with JAWS-II cells pulsed with
the formulation (B16.OVA membrane spiked with SIINFEKL-CPP). The supernatant
was collected and analyzed for the content in IFN-γ. As presented
in Figure S4, APCs pulsed with the formulations
presenting OVA and SIINFEKL (namely CCM and NanoCCM) activated OT-I
cells with the secretion of IFN-γ. The nanosystem induced a
statistically higher activation compared to CCM alone, despite the
higher level of cross-presentation achieved with CCM.

Overall,
we proved the cytocompatibility of the system and its
ability to induce the maturation of APCs, with an increase in the
expression of the co-stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86 to levels comparable
to those of the positive control (cells activated by LPS). Moreover,
the nanovaccine promotes the cross-presentation of antigens in APCs
and the subsequent activation of T cells. Our system, thereby, has
properties as adjuvant in a complete nanovaccine formulation.

Biohybrid
Nanoparticles Increase the Response Against B16F10
Melanoma by Modulating the Infiltration of Dendritic Cells and Cytotoxic
T-Lymphocytes
In these experiments, we tested our biohybrid
platform by engrafting C57 mice with the highly immune suppressive
B16F10 tumors. Hence, we treated the mice with TOPSi@AcDEX nanoparticles
extruded with a homologous membrane (B16F10 cells) to promote an anti-tumor
immune response. The percentage of mice responding to the therapy,
defined as mice showing a tumor volume lower than 300 mm3, was 12.5, 28.6, and 33.3% in the mock, CCM, and AcDEX groups respectively
(Figure 2A). Although
modest, we registered an increase in the number of responding mice
in the group treated with NanoCCM (44.4%). In a comparison between
the tumor volume in different groups (Figure S2), no significant difference was found between the three treatment
groups. We hypothesize that the intrinsic aggressiveness of the B16F10
tumor model prevents the possibility to fully evaluate the priming
of a tumor-specific immune response. However, the efficacy of the
treatment was limited to less than half of the cohort of animals,
providing indications for future improvements of the formulation.
Next, we investigated by flow cytometry whether or not the treatment
with NanoCCM could affect the immune infiltration of cells into the
tumor. Mice receiving NanoCCM showed a trend toward an increased infiltration
of DCs (defined as CD11c+ cells; Figure 2B) with a large portion of those being activated
and mature (CD80 and CD86 double positive cells; Figure 2C). In addition, we analyzed
the infiltration by T-cells to understand if the effect of NanoCCM
treatment on DCs would result also in an increased presence of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that
tumors of mice receiving the biohybrid nanoparticles were highly infiltrated
by cytotoxic T-cells (defined as CD3+CD8+ cells; Figure 2D). Remarkably, only
the treatment with NanoCCM was able to increase the presence of antigen-experienced
TILs when compared to a mock (p < 0.05), as proven
by the higher presence of PD-1+ T-cells (Figure 2E). However, the analysis of
the PD-1+ T-cells provides only information on the level
of the antigen experience of the T-cells, but not on the specific
antigen the cells have been primed for.25−27

Figure 2 Biohybrid nanovaccines

established tumors and induce immunological changes into the tumor
microenvironment. Female C57BL6/J mice (n = 7/8)
were engrafted with 1.0 × 105 B16F10 melanoma cells
on the right flank. After 6 days, the mice were randomized into 4
groups and treated subcutaneously with 5.4% isotonic glucose solution
(mock group), bare TOPSi@AcDEX nanoparticles (AcDEX group), processed
tumor-membrane vesicles (CCM group), or tumor-membrane-coated TOPSi@AcDEX
nanovaccines (NanoCCM group). A second treatment injection was performed
in the peri-tumoral region at day 13. (A) Single curves of each tumor
for each group. In this tumor model, responders (green curves) are
defined as mice that show an absolute tumor volume lower than 300
mm3. (B) Tumors were collected and stained for the presence
of DCs (CD11c+). (C) The activation state of the DCs was
characterized by using CD80 and CD86 surface markers. The presence
of TILs was also assessed. (D) Flow cytometry was used to detect intratumoral
cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+CD8+). (E) The activation
state of the TILs was investigated by analyzing the presence of the
PD-1 marker. All graphs represent mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis
was performed with unpaired Student’s t-test
or one-way ANOVA; the levels of significance were set at *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. The flow
cytometry data for every mouse are normalized against the tumor volume
of that mouse.

In line with our aim
to increase the response to immunotherapy,
we explored the correlation between immune infiltration of tumors
and tumor size among all groups. Our analysis revealed that mice with
smaller tumors showed significantly higher levels of TILs within the
tumors (Figure 3A);
in addition, PD-1+ TILs were enriched into the tumors of
the mice with a low tumor burden (Figure 3B). The presence of DCs and their activation
state also clearly distinguished nonresponders from responders (Figure 3C,D). Interestingly,
the data from two responders scored higher than the responders in Figure 3A–C, leading
us to hypothesize a trend with different levels of activation of the
immune system within the responders court. However, the study was
not powered enough to show statistical significance. Finally, we studied
the correlation between tumor volume and immune infiltration, and
we found that an exponential model would better describe the relationship
between those two parameters. In fact, for all of the tested correlations,
we achieved statistical significance (p < 0.05)
and a relatively good fitting to an exponential model, suggesting
that the correlation is unlikely to be linear, but it rather follows
an exponential model since anti-tumor responses are likely the result
of several co-operating factors (Figure 3E).

Figure 3 Correlation
between response to immune therapy and changes in the
tumor microenvironment of melanoma tumors. The flow cytometry data
presented in Figure 2 were used to perform an explorative analysis to correlate infiltration
of immune cells to tumor size. Responding (red data points) and nonresponding
(black data points) mice were grouped from all treatment groups and
analyzed for the intratumoral presence of (A) cytotoxic T-cells, (B)
antigen-experienced cytotoxic T-cells, (C) DCs, and (D) activated
and mature DCs. The statistical analysis was performed with unpaired
Student’s t-test, and the levels of significance
were set at *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. The flow cytometry data for every mouse are normalized
against the tumor volume of that mouse. (E) To evaluate the correlation
between immunological features and tumor response, data from all mice
were pooled, and the correlation was tested with Pearson’s
correlation test (the p-value is indicated in each
graph). The one phase exponential nonlinear models were used to fit
the data and retrieve the R2 for each
data set.

Biohybrid Nanoparticles
Prime Tumor-Specific Immune Responses
with Rejection of Established Melanomas
In this set of experiments,
we investigated the in vivo efficacy of our cancer
nanovaccine platform in a less aggressive setting. To this end, we
engrafted C57BL6 immunocompetent mice with the B16.OVA tumor cells.
Mice received treatments at 6 and 13 days after tumor engraftment.
As shown in Figure 4A, treatment with only immunogenic TOPSi@AcDEX (i.e., AcDEX) nanoparticles or tumor membrane (i.e.,
CCM) resulted in modest responses in 50% and 66% of the treated mice,
respectively. However, mice treated with the TOPSi@AcDEX particles
coated with the tumor membrane (hereafter named NanoCCM) responded
in 71% of the cases. Interestingly, this was the only group where
we registered complete responses in 28.5% (2 out of 7) of the mice
(Figure 4B). The average
volume curves for all of the groups are presented in Figure S3, highlighting the synergistic effect of the core
and CCM-layer over the single components. These results are consistent
with our previous experiments and highlight the potential of our nanoplatform
as a therapeutic cancer vaccine, since only two therapeutic injections
of NanoCCM were necessary to achieve significantly better results
compared to the mice in the control groups.

Figure 4 Biohybrid nanoparticles
increase the anti-tumor response and rejection
rate against established B16.OVA tumors. Female C57BL6/J mice were
engrafted with 2.5 × 105 B16.OVA cells on the right
flank. After 6 days, mice were randomized into 4 groups and treated
subcutaneously with 5.4% isotonic glucose solution (Mock group), bare
TOPSi@AcDEX nanoparticles (AcDEX group), processed tumor-membrane
(CCM group), or tumor-membrane-coated TOPSi@AcDEX nanoparticles (NanoCCM
group). A second treatment injection was performed in the peri-tumoral
region at day 13. (A) The single curves of each tumor for each group.
Responders (green curves) are defined as mice that show an absolute
tumor volume lower than 400 mm3. (B) The percentage of
complete responses (i.e., cured mice) observed in
each group.

Next, we investigated
if NanoCCM could modulate the activation
of DCs in this melanoma model. Consistent with the in vitro studies on APCs and with the results from the study in the more
aggressive tumor model, the tumor tissues of mice receiving any of
the immunotherapy treatment featured an increased number of tumor
infiltrating DCs (tDCs defined as CD11c+ CD11b+; Figure 5C). However,
we found substantial differences in the quality and activation state
of DCs (Figure 5D).
The AcDEX nanovaccine formulation proved to be the best in inducing
the expression of the activation markers on the surface of DCs.

vivo immunological effects of TOPSi@AcDEX-based
cancer vaccines. Individual tumor samples were collected at the end
point for each mouse, and the tumor-infiltrating cells were analyzed.
(A) The ratio of CD8+ to CD4+ TILs is reported
for every group. (B) The percentage of OVA-specific CD8+ TILs was measured by pentamer staining of tumor samples. The percentages
were normalized by the tumor volume of each mouse. Then, each data
set was normalized against a mock to measure the fold-increase over
the mock group. By definition, the mock group is 1. (C) DCs were defined
as CD11c+ and CD11b+ double positive cells within
the tumor microenvironment. Data were normalized to the tumor volume
of every mouse to take into account the different sizes of tumor masses
at the moment of tissue collection. (D) Total percentages of activated
and mature DCs, defined as either CD86+ (gray) or CD80+ (black) single positive or CD86+ CD80+ double positive cells (red). (E) Relative distribution and polarization
of the DCs subsets for each group. All graphs represent the mean ±
SEM. Statistical analysis done with unpaired Student’s t test; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.

Flow cytometry analysis
revealed an increase in the percentage
of the total activated DCs (either CD80+, CD86+, or double positive CD80+CD86+ cells), thereby
proving AcDEX to be an excellent adjuvant. Nevertheless, when we studied
the distribution of the activated population into the whole DCs population,
the tumors of mice treated with NanoCCM presented the highest percentage
of double positive CD80+CD86+DCs (39.36%), which
represent the most efficient maturation status of an APC. We conclude
that while all of the treatments induced a degree of maturation of
DCs, only NanoCCM treatment was able to reshape the distribution between
different maturation statuses, resulting in a lower percentage of
early activated DCs (6.38% of CD86+ cells) and a higher
percentage of fully activated DCs (39.36% of CD80+CD86+ cells) compared to the other groups (Figure 5E). It is noteworthy to stress that there
was only a limited amount of tissue recovered in the animals cured
after treatment with NanoCCM.

Biohybrid Nanoparticles
Increase the Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint
Blockade against Established Melanomas
In line with the efforts
to convert “cold tumors” into “hot tumors”,
we hypothesized that the biohybrid nanovaccine platform developed
here would increase the response rate to checkpoint inhibition, especially
increasing the number of the overall responders. To this end, we investigated
how the co-administration of anti-CTLA4 antibody, known to potentiate
the priming of T-cells, would increase the efficacy of our cancer
nanovaccine platform.

Established murine melanoma tumors (B16.OVA)
were treated at multiple time points (Figure 6A, black arrows) to prime and boost an antigen-specific
response. The NanoCCM treatment was combined with intraperitoneal
administration of aCTLA4 antibody (Nano-CCM + aCTLA4 group) and compared
with aCTLA4 monotherapy. The aCTLA antibody was selected for the evaluation
of the combinatorial therapy due to its mechanism of action that stimulated
the priming of T cells at a systemic level, different for aPD-L1 antibodies.28 We hypothesize that our nanovaccine is priming
an immune response against neoantigens, thereby a combo therapy with
an aCTLA4 antibody is most likely to result in a synergistic effect.
As expected, blocking the aCTLA4 inhibitory pathway slowed the growth
of tumors compared to treatment with a 5.4% glucose isotonic solution
(mock group). Mice receiving the combination treatment registered
a significant reduction in tumor volumes compared to both mock and
aCTLA monotherapies, as shown by the growth curves (Figure 6A) and their area under the
curve (Figure 6B).
One mouse using the aCTLA4 monotherapy experienced a complete response,
however the combo therapy NanoCCM + aCTLA4 was able to induce complete
responses in 25% of treated mice (Figure 6C). Consistent with the clinical data, while
checkpoint inhibition slowed the growth of tumors, the overall benefit
was inconsistent with few significant responses (Figure 6D, central panel). On the contrary,
we recorded an increase in the number of responders among mice receiving
the combination of aCTLA4 and NanoCCM cancer vaccines (87.5% of mice
responded to the therapy).

Figure 6 The efficacy of the anti-tumor effect of the
vaccination with biohybrid
nanoparticles is increased by co-administration of CTLA-4 checkpoint
inhibitor. Female C57BL6/J mice were engrafted with 2.5 × 105 B16.OVA cells on the right flank. After 6 days, mice were
randomized into 3 groups and treated subcutaneously with 5.4% isotonic
glucose solution (mock group), intraperitoneally with 100 μg
of anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, or with tumor-membrane coated
TOPSi@AcDEX nanoparticles (NanoCCM) + anti-CTLA4 antibody. Two more
rounds of treatment were performed at days 13 and 15 post-tumor engraftment.
(A) Tumor volumes at each time point were normalized against the initial
tumor volume. Then tumor growth curves were built by plotting the
mean ± SEM of tumor volumes for each group. (B) The area under
the curve (AUC) of the growth curve of each mouse is plotted in the
box and whiskers graphs (Tukey’s representation). (C) The number
of complete responses (i.e., cured mice) for each
group is reported. (D) Single growth curves are reported for each
group. Responders (green curves) are defined as mice which show an
absolute tumor volume lower than 400 mm3. The percentage
of responders in the group is reported next to each graph. Statistical
analysis of tumor growth was done by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s
multiple comparison correction. The AUCs were analyzed by unpaired
Student’s t test; *p <
0.05; **p < 0.01; ****p <
0.0001.

Immunological analysis showed
that aCTLA4 monotherapy was not able
to induce infiltration and expansion of CD8+ T cells into
tumors of mice. However, the combination of cancer nanovaccine and
the checkpoint inhibition induced a considerable increase in the number
of tumor infiltrating cells (Figure 7A), supported by an increase in myeloid APCs (Figure 7B,C) into the tumors.
When compared to a mock, both immunotherapies were able to increase
the activation of DCs (Figure 7D). As shown in Figure 7E, the combination of aCTLA4 and NanoCCM reduced the fraction
of early activated DCs (35.80%) compared to a mock (62.98%) and aCTLA
monotherapy (47.68%). The combination group also increased the percentage
of CD80+CD86+ double positive DCs (red portion
of cake graphs in Figure 7E).

Figure 7 Biohybrid nanoparticles favor the efficacy of the anti-CTLA-4 therapy
by reshaping the tumor microenvironment. Individual tumor samples
were collected at the end point for each mouse, and the tumor-infiltrating
cells were analyzed. (A) The percentage of CD8+ TILs was
normalized against the tumor volumes of each mouse to account for
the size of tumor masses. (B) Infiltration of myeloid cells (defined

Discussion
Tumor
growth results in a continuous apoptosis/necrosis of tumor
cells followed by their replacement during the invasion process.29 For this reason, the immune system is exposed
to tumor antigens constantly.18,30 However, this process
lacks a proper co-stimulation and pro-inflammatory signals, as the
tumor microenvironment is heavily immunosuppressive.31,32 Therefore, antigen presentation is usually ineffective, and it rarely
results in spontaneous and beneficial anti-tumor immunity.33 Therefore, it is crucial to provide the immune
system with adjuvants capable of optimizing the maturation of APCs,
which are at the center of every cancer vaccine approach.34 For this reason, cancer nanovaccines represent
an attractive choice to stimulate anti-tumor responses in a specific
and efficient manner.35 In this work, we
describe the anti-tumor efficacy and immunological effects of our
cancer nanovaccine platform based on biohybrid (TOPSi@AcDEX) nanoparticles
coated with membranes derived from tumors cells. The nanovaccine promotes
the activation of APCs (JAWS II cells) due to the biomaterials employed
in the formulation of the system. TOPSi nanoparticles promote the
maturation of immature monocyte-derived DCs due to their fast biodegradation
in physiological fluids, with the release of silicic acid.13 AcDEX increases the expression of major histocompatibility
complexes due to its rapid degradation in acidic conditions.15 The combination of the two biomaterials into
one nanovaccine formulation primed a Th-1 biased immune response in vitro over human peripheral blood monocytes.12 The biohybrid nanovaccine, as result of the
adjuvant properties of the biomaterials, can promote cross-presentation
of the antigens presented on the cell membrane.36 The antigens and maturation cues provided to the APCs result
in a complete immune response, with the activation of CD8 T cells
and the secretion of IFN-γ.

Moreover, an alternative mechanism
of antigen presentation to memory
T cells takes place through the cross-dressing of membranes.37,38 The pulsing of APCs with the nanovaccine results in the cross-dressing
of the membrane used to wrap the particles with the membrane of the
APCs.

One of the main advantages of our nanoplatform is the
possibility
to induce immune responses against multiple tumor antigens, without
the need to select specific peptides. Hence, tumor-membrane-coated
nanoparticles share some similarities with whole tumor vaccines. Whole
tumor vaccines have been studied in preclinical and clinical settings,39,40 and the main advantage of this approach is the ability to induce
responses against a wide variety of antigens, thus overcoming the
difficult selection of specific peptides.41,42 These classes of nanovaccines can be combined with cytokines to
support the priming of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).43 For instance, interleukin (IL) 2 has been used
in co-administration with tumor cells to sustain the proliferation
of CTLs, resulting in responses in 72% of treated patients.44

We were able to induce a higher number
of responses in a poorly
immunogenic tumor model, observing a change in the infiltration of
both DCs and T-cells (Figure 2). The modulation of the tumor microenvironment is a key aspect
for the success of immunotherapy, and immune profiling is gaining
momentum since it is often able to define patients who would respond
to the therapy. While some studies point to the mutational load of
tumors, which would help immune cells to recognize malignant ones,45 other studies point toward what has been defined
as “immune-contexture”.46 The infiltration of tumor tissues by tumor cells and the presence
of adaptive immunity (pre-existing or newly induced) are important
prognostic factors when considering combination therapies.47 Our biohybrid nanoparticle (Figure 2) was able to increase the
presence of TILs with an activated state (PD-1+), and this
can potentially improve the response to the CTLA-4 blockade, as consistently
described in a recent study elsewhere.48

We demonstrated that the combination of tumor membrane with
proper
immunologically active nanomaterial leads to better anti-tumor responses
in B16.OVA melanoma models, with higher rejection rates among treated
animals (Figure 4).
We found an increased activation of APCs and, in particular, DCs after
the treatment with NanoCCM (Figure 5D). The treatment with vesicles isolated from the tumor
cells increases the number of the APCs in the tumor tissue, but is
not sufficient to induce their activation without adding any adjuvant,22 while the nanoparticles alone induce the maturation
of APCs that, however, are not tumor specific.15

In the last five years, the immunotherapy field has
gained new
attraction due to the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
This class of antibodies blocks inhibitory pathways that tumor cells
exploit to inactivate cytotoxic CTLs.49−51 However, while very
effective, the number of patients that benefit from the expensive
treatment with ICIs remains limited. In fact, resistance mechanisms
reduce the response rate,52 and the absence
of antigen-specific T cells into the tumor microenvironment represents
the biggest limitation. In addition, tumors with poor T cell infiltration,
often defined as “cold tumors”, are resistant to checkpoint
therapy, as ICIs do not create immune responses, but they simply protect
primed T cells from inactivation.53−55 Recently, biomaterials
have been developed for the local delivery of ICIs, in an effort to
reduce side effects and to improve the efficacy.6−11 Therefore, in line with the efforts to convert “cold tumors”
into “hot tumors”, we hypothesized that the biohybrid
nanovaccine platform developed here would increase the response rate
to checkpoint inhibition. We observed that blocking the inhibitory
pathway with an anti-CTLA4 poorly improves the response to aggressive
established tumors, as shown in Figure 6. However, an increase in the number of responders
was achieved when the anti-CTLA-4 antibody was combined with the biohybrid
nanovaccine platform. The nanovaccine platform provided a strong maturation
signal to DCs that was converted into an increased presence of CD8+ T-lymphocytes into the tumor microenvironment, synergizing
with anti-CTLA-4 treatment (Figure 7).

We would like to emphasize that the results
herein presented are
limited to murine melanoma models, implying that the efficacy of the
treatment may be different in less immunogenic tumor models. Moreover,
the results of the immunological profiling can be biased by the reduced
tumor volume or by the rejection (no tumor retrievable) in the group
treated with the complete formulation. We would also like to stress
the absence of a direct causative relationship between the phenotypical
changes recorded in the tumor microenvironment and the efficacy of
the treatments. The analysis of the presentation of co-stimulatory
signals by DCs does not represent per se a justification
to affirm the presence of an immune response induced by the nanovaccine.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the in vivo mode of action of the nanovaccine, analyzing in particular the molecular
and functional changes induced in APCs.

Conclusion
In
summary, the biohybrid nanovaccine is able to elicit an anti-tumor
immune response in aggressive melanoma models and to modify also the
immunological profile within the tumor microenvironment. The administration
of the vaccine enhances the activation of APCs, leading to an increased
priming of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the combination therapy
with the administration of the nanovaccine platform and a checkpoint
inhibitor improves the anti-tumor efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor
alone. The versatility of the biohybrid (tumor-membrane-coated) nanoparticle
platform represents an advantage in the personalized medicine field,
where tumor membranes can be obtained from patient’s biopsies
in order to eliminate histocompatibility problems and target patient-specific
neo-antigens present in the tumor cells. The production of the nanovaccine
is faced with the scale up from a laboratory to clinical batches.
However, the scaling up is facilitated by the production of the particles
by microfluidics, in single devices that may produce up to 700 g/day.56 In addition, this class of cancer nanovaccines
can be easily combined with checkpoint inhibitors in order to protect
primed T cells from inactivation, increasing the rate of responders
to standard care immunotherapies available on the market.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Reagents
The murine
melanoma cell line
B16.OVA, a mouse melanoma cell line expressing chicken ovalbumin (OVA),
was kindly provided by Prof. Richard Vile (Mayo Clinic, Rochester,
MN, USA). This cell line was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) 1640 media (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% of
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher), 1% of l-glutamine
(Glutamax, Gibco, Thermo Fisher), and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin
(Gibco, Thermo Fisher). To ensure the expression of OVA protein and
the selection of OVA-positive clones, cells were cultured with geneticin
antibiotic at a 10% concentration (G418, Gibco, Thermo Fisher). B16F10
cells were cultured as B16.OVA, without the addiction of geneticin
to the flasks. B16.OVA and B16F10 cells were used both as source of
the membranes to coat the system and as tumor models implanted in
the animals. JAWS II (ATCC CRL-11904) was used to evaluate the cytocompatibility
and the immunostimulative properties of the system in the presence
of the check-point inhibitor. JAWS II cells were cultured in 20% α-modified
Eagle’s medium (aMEM, HyClone, USA) supplemented with 5 ng/mL
of murine GM-CSF. OT-1 splenocytes were isolated from 4–8 week
old C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J (OT-1) mice (The Jackon Laboratories)
and frozen at −80 °C until use. The splenocytes were then
thawed in lymphocyte media (RPMI supplemented with 10% of FBS, 20
mmol/L l-glutamine, 1% of penicillin/streptomycin, 15 mmol/L
HEPES, 50 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L Na pyruvate,
160 ng/mL murine IL-2, and 0.3 μg/mL anti-CD3 antibody clone
145–2C11).57In vivo Mab anti-CTLA-4 antibody was purchased form Bio X Cell (West Lebanon,
NH, USA).

Animal Experiments
C57BL/6J mice were obtained from
Scanbur (Denmark) at 4–6 weeks of age. Mice were kept in air-isolated
cages with unlimited access to food. All procedures were carried out
under sterile conditions. Mice were anesthetized using isofluorane
vaporizers. Subcutaneous tumor models were developed by injecting
either 1 × 105 or 2.5 × 105 B16.OVA
tumor cells (when 80% confluent in T175 flasks) in the right flank
of each mouse in 100 μL of nonsupplemented RPMI-1640 medium.
Details about the treatment schedule are given in the figure legends.
During the experiments, the tumor volume was recorded every 2 days
by using a digital caliper. Maximum (L) and minimum
(l) tumor diameters were recorded, and tumor volumes
were calculated according to the formula: (L × l2)/2.

All animal experiments were reviewed and approved
by the Experimental Animal Committee of the University of Helsinki
and the Provincial Government of Southern Finland.

Top-Down Production
of Thermally Oxidized Porous Silicon (TOPSi)
Particles
The detailed protocol for the preparation of TOPSi
nanoparticles can be found elsewhere.58,59 The anodization
of silicon wafers into a solution of hydrofluoric acid:ethanol (1:1)
introduces pores within the silicon wafer. The porous layer is then
detached, oxidized for 2 h at 300 °C, and milled in ethanol with
a high-energy ball mill to yield nanoparticles. The particles are
then segregated into the different size ranges by centrifugation and
kept at +4 °C in ethanol.

Synthesis of Acetalated
Dextran (AcDEX)
Acetalated
dextran was synthesized according to the reaction reported elsewhere.12,60,61 Briefly, we added dextran (1
g, MW 9000–11,000 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to a two-neck flask,
previously dried, and we purged the flask with dry N2.
Dextran powder was dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mL,
Sigma-Aldrich, USA) before adding pyridinium-p-toluenesulfonate
(15.6 mg; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 2-methoxypropene (3.4 mL; Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). We quenched the reaction with trimethylamine (1 mL; Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) after 1 h, and we employed H2O (200 mL) to precipitate
the modified dextran. The pellet was centrifuged (10 min, 20,000g) and washed twice with trimethylamine solution (100 mL;
0.01% v/v; pH 8). Finally, to remove the residual trimethylamine solution,
the powder was vacuum-dried at 40 °C for 48 h, producing a fine
white powder of acetalated dextran (1.10 g).15

Isolation of Cancer Cell Membranes (CCM) from B16F10 and B16.OVA
Cells
We isolated the cell membranes following the protocol
reported elsewhere.12,22 We cultured the cells as described
above. Upon reaching 80% of confluence, we removed the medium, washed
the cells with 1 × phosphate buffer solution-ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (PBS-EDTA; pH 7.4) solution, and detached them using a 0.25%
trypsin-PBS EDTA solution (HyClone, USA). The cells were centrifuged
at 409g for 5 min, and the cells were washed 3 times
with 1 × PBS (pH 7.4). Then, we resuspended the pellet of cells
into lysing buffer (20 mM of TRIS HCl; Sigma-Aldrich, USA; 10 mM of
KCl; Sigma-Aldrich, USA; 2 mM of MgCl2; Sigma-Aldrich,
USA; 1 protease inhibitor mini tablet, EDTA free; Pierce, Thermo Fisher,
USA) and pipetted them thoroughly. The cells were then centrifuged
at 3200g for 5 min, the supernatant collected, and
the pellet resuspended again in lysing buffer and pipetted. The cells
were centrifuged a second time at 3200g for 6 min.
We pooled the supernatant and centrifuged it at 20,000g with a TLA 120.2 rotor in a ultracentrifuge (Optima MAX, Beckmann
Coulter, USA) for 20 min. We then collected the supernatant and centrifuged
it at 45,000g for 5 min. The supernatant was then
discarded, and we resuspended the membranes in Milli Q water.

Production
of the Nanovaccine Components by Microfluidics Nanoprecipitation
and Encapsulation with CCM by Film Extrusion
The core structure
of the formulation was prepared by nanoprecipitation in a glass capillary
microfluidics device, as reported elsewhere.12 We employed a device presenting a 3D co-flow geometry for nanoprecipitation.
The assembly of the device has been described elsewhere.62 The inner capillary (ID 580 μm, OD 1 mm;
World Precision Instruments Inc., USA) was pointed with a micropipette
puller (P-97, Sutter Instrument Co., USA) to a diameter of approximately
20 μm. We then tapered the capillary to enlarge the diameter
to approximately 100 μm. This capillary was then inserted and
aligned coaxially into the outer capillary (ID 1.10 mm, Vitrocom,
USA), and we assembled them in the microfluidics platform. In the
nanoprecipitation technique, the inner and outer solutions are miscible
and are pumped, keeping the flow rates constant, in the microfluidics
device in the same direction. The flow rate of the two phases was
controlled by two pumps (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, USA), and the
liquids were pumped from syringes into the capillaries through polyethylene
tubes. To prepare TOPSi@AcDEX particles, we resuspend TOPSi particles
in an ethanol solution of AcDEX for the inner phase, while we employed
a 1% (w/v) poly(vinyl alcohol) aqueous solution for the outer phase.
We fixed the inner flow rate to 2 mL/h and the other to 40 mL/h. The
collection vial was kept under stirring (approximately 300g), and the collected particles were washed once with Milli-Q
water (12959g, 5 min). Finally, the cell membrane layer was added
on the surface of the particles by film extrusion through a 0.8 μm
filter (Nucleopore Track-Etch Membrane, Whatman, UK) with an Avanti
extruder (Avanti Lipids, USA). The cell membrane used for the extrusion
of the samples was homologous to the cells used to establish the tumor
models, B16.F10 in experiment 1 and B16.OVA in experiments 2 and 3.

Characterization of the Nanovaccine by Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS) and Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS)
The hydrodynamic
radius and the surface charge of the nanovaccine were evaluated by
DLS and ELS with a Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK).
Each sample was diluted 1:50, and 1 mL of the dilution was pipetted
in a disposable polystyrene cuvette (Sarstedt AG&Co., Germany)
to determine the size. The temperature of each sample was equilibrated
to 25 °C before each measurement. About 750 μL of the particle
suspension in Milli Q-water (pH 7.4) was pipetted into a disposable
folded capillary cell (DTS1070, Malvern Ltd., UK).

Cytocompatibility
Studies
We assessed the cytocompatibility
of TOPSi@AcDEX@CCM alone or in the presence of two different concentrations
of murine anti-CTLA-4 antibody (In vivo Mab antimouse
CTLA-4, CD152, clone 9D9, Bio X Cell, USA). Briefly, 50 μL of
a 4 × 105 cell/mL suspension of JAWS II cells was
seeded into 96-well plates (Corning Inc., USA) and left attaching
overnight. We added 50 μL of the appropriate sample, redispersed
in medium, in each well. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. At the time point, we then added 100 μL
of Cell Titer Glo (Promega, USA) solution to each well. A Varioskan
Lux reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) was employed to read
the resulting luminescence. Triton X-100 (1%) and 20% of FBS aMEM
were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.

Immunostimulation
Assay
We evaluated the immunostimulative
properties of the nanovaccine and the effect of the combination with
a check-point inhibitor in JAWS II cells. About 0.7 mL of a 4 ×
105 cell/mL suspension was seeded in 12-well plates (Corning
Inc., USA) and left attaching overnight. 0.7 mL of the appropriate
sample was added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37
°C with 5% CO2. Upon each time point, the medium was
removed and centrifuged to recover the cells in suspension, and the
adherent cells were detached with cold PBS-EDTA. The cells were then
centrifuged and suspended in 90 μL of cold PBS. Five μL
of APC antimouse CD80 (BD Biosciences, USA) and 5 μL of PerCP-Cy
5.5 antimouse CD86 (BioLegend, USA) antibodies were added to each
sample. The samples were incubated for 20 min in the dark at +4 °C.
To remove the unbound antibody, the cells were centrifuged, the supernatant
discarded, and the cell pellet washed twice with cold PBS. We then
suspend the cells in 700 μL of cold PBS and analyzed by flow
cytometry (FACS) on a LSR II (BD Biosciences, USA). A compensation
of the signal from each fluorochrome in the multistaining analysis
was run. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 20% of FBS aMEM were used as
positive and negative controls, respectively.

Flow Cytometry and Analysis
of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells
Tumors were excised from
the euthanized animals, and single cell
suspensions were obtained by gently disrupting the tissue samples
on a cell strainer (70 μm net-size) with a syringe plunger.
Samples were then cryopreserved at −80 °C, by adding 10%
of DMSO to cell suspension, until the day of analysis. Samples were
quickly thawed into a water bath (+37 °C) and washed once in
PBS. Anti-CD16/32 antibody was used to block unspecific staining from
Fc receptors. Cells were then stained for 30 min with antibody cocktails
on ice. Next, cells were washed to eliminate excess antibodies and
fixed in 4% of formalin for 10 min on ice. Samples were washed two
times and analyzed by flow cytometry. A Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter) was used to acquire the data, and FlowJo (Threestar) software
was used for data analysis. Antibodies from BD-biosciences were used
to stain cells for T-cell (CD8, CD4 and CD3) or DCs (CD11b, CD11c,
CD86 and CD80) specific markers.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined
using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
A detailed description of the statistical methods used to analyze
the data from each experiment can be found in each figure legend.
