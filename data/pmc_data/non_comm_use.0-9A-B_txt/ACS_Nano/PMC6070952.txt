In order to combat
the growing threat of global infectious diseases,
there is a need for rapid diagnostic technologies that are sensitive
and that can provide species specific information (as might be needed
to direct therapy as resistant strains of microbes emerge). Here,
we present a convenient, enzyme-free amplification mechanism for a
rational hybridization chain reaction, which is implemented in a simple
format for isothermal amplification and sensing, applied to the DNA-based
diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 54 patients. During the cycled
amplification process, DNA monomers self-assemble in an organized
and controllable way only when a specific target HBV sequence is present.
This mechanism is confirmed using super-resolution stochastic optical
reconstruction microscopy. The enabled format is designed in a manner
analogous to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, generating colored
products with distinct tonality and with a limit of detection of ca.
five copies/reaction. This routine assay also showed excellent sensitivity
(>97%) in clinical samples demonstrating the potential of this
convenient,
low cost, enzyme-free method for use in low resource settings.

==== Body
The sensitive
and specific detection
of nucleic acids is important in a wide range of clinical diagnostic
analyses. Although DNA biosensors have previously been developed,1 currently their implementation often relies on
the enzymatic amplification of the target DNA. This can be achieved
using either thermal cycling (e.g., polymer chain reaction, PCR),
isothermal amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP)2 or cross-priming
amplification (CPA),3 for example. Many
of these enzyme-mediated assays have been constrained in their use,
requiring well-resourced settings with well-controlled environmental
conditions (for enzyme storage) as well as the need for complex sample
purification steps (to avoid reaction inhibitors present in samples).

To overcome these limitations, isothermal, enzyme-free methods
have been developed, based on specific DNA hybridization, which amplify
the biochemical signal.4 As a general scheme,
the presence of target DNA (from bacteria, for example) leads to the
opening of DNA hairpin structures to create a chain reaction involving
many hairpin openings, resulting in multiple hybridizations. Such
cascades lead to the formation of a large DNA complex, which can then
be easily detected, either optically or using label-free sensing.5−9 This chain reaction and, thus, the molecular weight/size of the
product (as the amplified signal) have proven to be difficult to control,
limiting the opportunities to develop high sensitivity and quantitative
assays. Consequently, enzymatic mediated methods, such as PCR, remain
the gold standard for DNA amplification and sensing, providing quantitative
and controllable amplification, albeit in well-controlled environmental
conditions.10,11

We now show a different
class of HCR assay which combines the advantages
of controlled amplification with hybridization (as the fundamental
principles of an enzyme-free biochemical reaction) in order to develop
a quantitative and sensitive DNA amplification technique. The technique
is self-limiting, as the amplification is sustained only until reactants
become kinetically depleted.

Results and Discussion
Reaction Mechanism
The proposed rational HCR is based
on two primer dumbbell-shaped DNA (db DNA) structures (U1 and U2),
capable of binding to each other stoichiometrically (one unit of each
can bind to 4 units of the other, Figure 1a), thus providing the potential for an exponential
growth. The primer dumbbells are formed by two starting oligonucleotides
(U1–1/U1–2 and U2–1/U2–2) with a complementary
nucleotide matching in their midsequence (1/1c of U1 and 4/4c of U2).
There are also two exposed “sticky” ends, each complementary
to the other (e.g., 2 of U1 is complementary to 2c of U2). At each
cycle, one unit (e.g., U1) serves as the template for the hybridization
with a number of the other unit (e.g., U2). Once hybridization is
complete, the second unit (e.g., U2) is removed from the reaction
volume and replaced with the first unit (e.g., U1), which can then
hybridize with the product of the previous cycle.

Figure 1 Reaction principle of
db DNA-based rational HCR. (a) Schematic illustration
of synthesis and inter-reaction of db DNA
units. Two starting oligonucleotides (U1–1/U1–2 or U2–1/U2–2)
possess the same sticky ends at 3′ and 5′ ends, as well
as  complementary midsequence segments, as indicated. For the
process starting from U1 (left), the db DNA units (U1 or U2) hybridize
(step 1). Similarly, the DNA synthesis process can also begin from
U2 (right). The formed db DNA units (U2) can be combined to U1 during
the rational HCR process (step 2), due to their exposed complementary
sticky ends. Thus, by addition of U2 and U1 successively and repeatedly,
these two units can bind to each other leading to an exponential growth
of a packed complex 3D DNA structure (step n); (b) Evaluation
of the product of db DNA-based rational HCR using gel electrophoresis.
L lane was 100 bp ladder, lane 1 and 2 were U1 and U2, Lanes 3 and
4 were the hybridized products of U1 and U2 with stoichiometry ratio
at 5:1 (and 1:5, respectively), and Lanes 5 and 6 were the product
of stoichiometry ratio at 20:1 (and 1:20, respectively), the unit
with a low concentration was kept at 0.1 μM. Bands from 90 to
225 bp (from lane 3 to 6) illustrate the expected products ratios,
which are different to those from the smallest units (lane 1/2). For
this concentration of single units, larger products are not formed
efficiently (evidence of limited formation is shown by smears in the
large sizes), since the single units become depleted as the reaction
progresses.

The amplification factor
and, thus, the molecular weight of the
amplicon at each cycle are linked to the number of units that can
bind to the product of the previous cycle, between 1 and 4 (which
is itself dependent on the concentration ratios between the 2 units, Figure 1b). By analogy to
the PCR cycle, the rate of amplification reaches a plateau as the
concentration of available primers for the reaction decreases, and
the kinetics of the reaction become rate-limiting.

We confirmed
the relationship between the molecular weight of the
amplicon after the first cycle and the stoichiometry ratios of the
db DNA primers, using gel electrophoresis. Figure 1b shows the db DNA units (U1 and U2) alone
(45 bp, lanes 1–2) and after having been mixed in a ratio of
1:5 (lanes 3–4) and 1:20 (lanes 5–6). The reaction forms
stable structures with 2 db DNA and 3, 4, and 5 db DNA together. As
the stoichiometric ratio decreases, the amount of the larger complexes
increases at the expense of the smaller ones. For example, the intensity
of the band at 225 bp (5 dbDNA) is similar (unitary) to the band at
90 bp (2 dbDNA) at a ratio of 1:5 but is much higher (double) at a
ratio of 1:20. Theoretically, the first step of the reaction should
proceed at maximal efficiency (or coverage) with a ratio of 1:4, where
all U1 binds to 4 U2 (Figure 1a); however, due to mass transfer and competing hybridizations,
a range of constructs of different sizes are formed, while larger
sizes are favored by smaller ratios. In order to demonstrate that
this rational HCR DNA amplification system forms large, packed DNA
nanostructures as predicted, we used a system where a single dumbbell
DNA structure can self-hybridize (Figure S1a) at the same stoichiometry as that of the 2 db structure, i.e.,
at a ratio of 1:4. The product of this single db DNA-mediated HCR
was evaluated using gel electrophoresis (Figure S1b), showing bands of increasing sizes, corresponding to increasing
numbers of unit db DNA bound together, as well as products with a
much larger size (as a smear).

Reaction Cycling
As discussed, the control of the rate
of reaction is dependent upon the stoichiometric ratio between the
two db DNA primers, one being in excess to the other, in order to
build a structure based on a 1:4 complex. To then continue amplification,
this excess needs to be reversed. Here, we show that this can be implemented
conveniently through the immobilization of the appropriate reagents
on beads with a simple washing step, implemented as cycles involving
the addition of one primer (followed by incubation, washing and then
addition of the second primer in a new cycle). At each cycle, the
number of exposed sticky ends created is 3 per primer bound, the number
of which is linked to the number of sticky ends at the previous cycle.
The size of the structure thus scales in a controlled and well-defined
manner as 4 × 3n db DNA primers,
where n is the number of cycles (Figure S2).

The washing steps can be conveniently performed,
using a magnetic microbead solid support (Figure 2), taking advantage of their high surface-to-volume
ratio (as previously demonstrated through the host of applications
they have been used in, such as biobarcode,12 DNA-based fluorescence nanobarcodes,13 and enzyme based optical nanoprobes).14 Here, we attached a biotin-labeled DNA capture probe on the surface
of a microparticle through an avidin coupling as previously described.13 The probe was complementary to a target DNA
sequence (the analyte to be detected), which was then bound onto the
bead. One sticky end of a db DNA primer was designed to be complementary
to the target DNA sequence, such that it can initiate the amplification
reaction and hybridize with the target DNA on the bead. The first
primer was washed off and replaced by the second db DNA primer. Three
molecules hybridize to the first primer, and the reaction can then
be cycled to achieve signal amplification. To detect the hybridization
and thus the target DNA sequence, both primers were labeled with the
fluorophore Cy5 at their 5′ stick ends (two fluorophore per
primer). Theoretically (Figure 1a), the number of fluorophore in the construct thus should
increase by a factor 3n, potentially yielding
a large signal for a small number of target molecules bound toward
single molecule detection.

Figure 2 Microbead-based DNA detection: (a) Schematic
drawing of db DNA-based
rational HCR for signal amplification of target DNA from magnetic
microbeads. Briefly, biotin-labeled capture probes were immobilized
onto avidin-functionalized microbeads. Target DNA was then captured
by these specific microbeads. The detection probe links to U1′
and is also complementary to a second part of the target DNA and thus
enabled U1 to bind to the surface of microbeads (see Table S1 for details). Fluorescence-labeled db DNA units were
successively added to amplify the signal, forming larger constructs
as the reactions proceeds. A washing step is necessary after each
hybridization step to remove the excess db DNA units. (b) Fluorescence
signal of microbeads at different cycles, imaged by super-resolution
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) (the images’
contrast and brightness were modified for ease of presentation) and
analyzed using segmentation (see Figure S4 for an example of the process), showing the average area of a fluorescent
spot (measured in pixels) for at least 10 beads for each cycle of
washing and addition of reagent. All beads are 5 μm in diameter.

To confirm the mechanism proposed,
we captured super-resolution
images of individual beads as the rational HCR progresses. The number
of captured fluorescence-labeled db DNA units on the surface of the
microbeads increases (Figure 2a) for each cycle, leading to an exponential amplification
of the fluorescence signals that started from individual immobilized
targets as shown by the super-resolution images presented and quantified
in Figure 2b. The size
of the fluorescent clusters, identified by segmentation (see Figure S4 for an example of the process), increases
as the beads are processed through more cycles of hybridization and
wash. By increasing the target DNA concentration, the number of spots
on each bead can increase significantly, indicating that each spotlike
feature represents the signal of a single event (Figure S3). The signal can also be viewed using a normal fluorescence
microscope (Figure S3).

Assay Format
As a practical demonstration, the detection
of the sensing events at such low concentrations using fluorescence
is not feasible routinely, as it requires scanning observation fields
with high magnification to identify individual fluorescent beads.
We thus adapted the signal amplification technique of enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA),14,15 where an avidin-labeled
enzyme (horseradish peroxidase, HRP, ca. 6 nm in diameter) was attached
to a biotin-db DNA primer (Figure 3). To avoid unspecific binding of the enzyme onto the
bead surface, this was only added at the last cycle, at the end of
the rational HCR. Two out of the three sticky ends of the db DNA primer
host a biotin moeity. After cycle n, there are 4
× 3n sticky ends, yielding 8 ×
3n–1 sites for the immobilization
of HRP, forming a densely packed HRP complex on the surface of the
microbeads. The result of db DNA-based enzyme-linked HCR analysis
was quantified on a microplate reader (450 nm) or directly by the
naked eye (Figure 4), after the substrate (tetramethylbenzidine, TMB) was added.

Figure 3 Schematic

is anchored to the magnetic microparticles (MMPs) by the biotin-labeled
capture probes and then recognized and amplified by the biotin-labeled
db DNA units. The enzyme is linked to the complex through the interaction
between enzyme-decorated avidin and biotin reaction.

The results are quantified in (d). Absorbance at 450 nm. Data are
the average of at least three replicates, and error bars represent
the standard deviation. The signal increases until a plateau is reached
after 5000 copies/reaction. The limit of detection is 5 copies/reaction.
(e) 1 pM of different target DNA molecules was added to the reaction:
perfect match DNA, single mismatch DNA with the defect located at
different position (toward the 5′ end, the 3′ end and
in the middle respectively), and noncognate DNA. The sequences are
provided in Table S1. Data are the average
of at least three replicates, and error bars represent the standard
deviation.

The observed response curve is
analogous to that of a real-time
PCR assay, Figure 4a, with the signal increasing exponentially with the number of cycles
performed, until kinetically depleted. We could define an equivalent
cycle threshold (Ct) of 9 when the signal reaches a level of intensity
higher than 3 standard deviation off the background. A linear regression
of the logarithm of the absorbance in the exponential phase reveals
a slope of 0.25 ± 0.03, which would correspond to an amplification
factor of 1.28n–1 (as opposed to
3n–1, predicted theoretically).
We attribute this limitation in efficiency to two main factors, namely
the fact the thermodynamic equilibrium of all DNA bound is kinetically
limited, leading to unbound DNA, as well as steric hindrance, which
limits DNA binding to available sites in complex, large structures
together with HRP labeling in the final step.

The signal reached
a plateau after cycle 16, when the number of
molecules added at the beginning of the cycle (free db DNA primer
0.5 μM, ca. 1010 molecules) is of the same order
as that of sticky ends present on the beads (8 × 315, ca. 109), thus limiting the efficiency of the reaction
(as discussed in Figure 1b).

Analytical Performance
The analytical performance of
the assay, as shown in Figure 4c,d, shows a limit of detection of five molecules in a 20
μL reaction after 35 cycles. Once amplified, the signal was
also detectable with the naked eye (Figure 4c). Specificity was evaluated using an excess
of noncomplementary target DNA, which did not produce a significant
absorption compared to specific target DNA (Figure 4e). Further, we also studied the ability
of the assay to effectively discriminate a single-base mismatch in
the target DNA (Figure 4e). The technique relies on DNA hybridization, and we observe behaviors
similar to those of other techniques based on the same principle,
such as DNA microarrays.16 The discrimination
is not effective when the defect is located at the edges of the binding
sequence, but the probe sequence can be designed to yield a signal
close to that of a noncognate DNA and provide excellent mismatch discrimination,
when the defect is located in the middle of the sequence.

Contrary
to DNA-based signal amplification methods developed previously, such
as chemical cross-linked dendritic DNA,16−18 DNA nanobarcodes,13,19 and backbone-branched oligonucleotides,20−22 this rational
HCR cycling method harnesses the level of control of biochemical reactions
that has been instrumental in placing PCR as a gold standard technique
in molecular biology. The microbead-based assay process is also simple
and convenient, where analysis of a few copies of target DNA can be
performed visually, with the naked eye, making it suitable for performing
DNA-based diagnostics.

Clinical Applicability
To demonstrate
the applicability
of the technique in the clinic, we designed an assay to detect hepatitis
B virus (HBV) in patients. HBV is a major cause of death worldwide
(comparable to HIV and tuberculosis—1.46 millions death in
2013).23 If the elimination targets (by
2030) of the World Health Organization are to be met, better approaches
to reach underserved populations are to be developed. In a group of
54, our cyclic HCR methodology detected 37/38 infected patients (benchmarked
against real-time qPCR), missing only one patient in the cohort, who
had a low infection burden (<10 copies, see Figure 5 and data in the Supporting Information). There was very good agreement with rt-qPCR, on
par with the best assays available; see also Figure 5.

Figure 5 Correlation between the copy number of each
clinical sample and
the intensity of the signal (absorbance) obtained after rational 35
cycles of HCR. Dashed red line is a linear fit (R2 = 0.9). The lowest copy number sample was not detected
using rational HCR (signal below threshold of 0.12).

Conclusions
In this work, we have
designed and demonstrated a cyclic HCR technique
to detect DNA molecules using an enzyme-free amplification scheme.
The control enabled by cycling the reaction, akin to that available
in PCR, led to high sensitivity (ca. five copies). We also demonstrated
the applicability of the method in clinical study to detect HBV in
the serum of patients. The method could also in the future be used
for single molecule sensing by using electrochemical detection for
HRP-catalyzed reactions24 or super-resolution
microscopy as illustrated here. Furthermore, the db DNA primer units
are both efficient structural scaffolds and functional molecules which
could be modified to develop proteomic and metabolomic assays by replacing
the target DNA with aptamers.25

Experimental Methods
Oligonucleotides Designs
The oligo sequences were designed
and tested for hybrids and hairpin structures using the Integrated
DNA Technologies design tools;2600 sequence
information can be found in Table S1. The
oligos were commercially synthesized, PAGE purified (Eurofins, UK),
and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), pH = 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 μM. Two
db DNA units were constructed by mixing two specific oligonucleotide
components (1:1 molar ratio) in 2× SSC buffer with a final concentration
of 2 μM for each oligonucleotide. The hybridizations were performed
as follows: (1) denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; (2) annealing
at 50 °C for 10 min; (3) further annealing at 37 °C for
10 min. The final annealed products were stored at room temperature.
The db DNA units was evaluated on 3% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE
buffer at 75 V for 2 h, stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic acid Gel Stain
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) (lanes 1 and 2 in Figure 1b).

Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging
The conjugation of
the magnetic microbeads and the DNA capture probe was carried out
using a modified protocol (Bangs Laboratories) as previously described.13 Briefly, 1.0 μg of avidin-coated microparticle
(5 μm) suspension was washed with 100 μL of TTL buffer
(100 mM Tris–HCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 1 M LiCl, pH 8.0) and resuspended
in 10 μL of TTL. A 1 pmol portion of biotin-modified capture
DNA probe was then mixed with the resuspended microparticle solution
and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation.
The excess and weakly bound probes were then washed away using 100
μL of TTL buffer, TT buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% Tween 20,
pH 8.0), TTE buffer (250 mM Tris–HCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 20 mM
Na2(EDTA), pH 8.0), and TT buffer after centrifugation
at 5000g for 3 min. The capture probe functionalized
microparticles were incubated at 68 °C for 30 min in a prehybridization
buffer (0.5 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 7% (wt/vol) SDS and 1%
(wt/vol) BSA (pH 8.0)) to functionalize the surface. After removing
the prehybridization buffer, the probe-functionalized microparticles
were resuspended and stored in hybridization 1 × SSC buffer.

The sample for fluorescence microscopy was prepared by thoroughly
mixing the capture probe functionalized polystyrene microbeads suspension with
target DNA in 50 μL hybridization buffer at room temperature
for 30 min to ensure uniform coating. Subsequently, 5 μL of
1 μM detection probe conjugated with U1 (formed with ssDNA U1–1′
and U1–2) was added into the solution and incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. U1 hybridized onto microbeads in the presence
of target DNA via a sandwiched hybridization (Figure 2a). The sample was washed three times with
50 μL of hybridization buffer to remove excess and weakly bound
detection probe. The U1 immobilized microbeads were then mixed with
formed Cy5-labeled U1 and U2 (5 μL, 0.5 μM) successively
and repeatedly in 20 μL hybridization buffer at room temperature
for 20 min every time and centrifuged at 5000g for
3 min to remove the suspension. After that, the microbeads were washed
with 50 μL 0.2× SSC buffer five times to remove excess
and weakly bound db DNA units. The microbeads were concentrated to
a final concentration of ca. 5000 beads/mL. A 1 μL portion of
the concentrated suspension was added onto a glass slide. A coverslip
was glued onto the glass slide using nail varnish. For conventional
fluorescence microscopy, the sample was imaged on a Zeiss LSM 800
confocal laser scanning microscope at 630-fold magnification using
a far-red filter (Cy5). The images were analyzed using the ZEN 2.1
lite software. For super-resolution microscopy (STORM), the samples
were imaged using an ELYRA PS1 microscope (Zeiss), using a 100×
Plan-apochromat objective (NA 1.46 oil immersion). A series of 2000
cycles were acquired in total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF)
mode for each experimental measurements using 642 nm laser (100% power)
and 405 nm laser (1% power during integration). For visualization,
“Localization Precision” (20–35 nm) and “Chi
Square” (1.5–3) filters were used. Images were segmented
using CellProfiler (v2.2.0)26 to identify
fluorescent spots and measure shape and intensity.

db DNA-Based
ELISA
For db DNA-based ELISA, the preparation
of capture probe coated magnetic microparticles (MMPs) (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was carried out as previously described.14 Briefly, the avidin modified MMPs (1 μm) were washed
with 100 μL of washing buffer (50 Mm Tris–HCl, 150 Mm
NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) twice. A solution of biotinylated capture
probe was added to the collected MMPs (at a ratio of 2.5 nmol probe
1 to 1 mg MMPs). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for
20 min with gentle shaking to immobilize the capture probe. The capture
probe coated MMPs were collected using a magnetic separator, washed
three times with washing buffer, and resuspended in blocking solution
(10 mM phosphate sodium buffer solution, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5% PEG
and 2% BSA). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the
treated MMPs were washed with washing buffer twice and stored in stocking
solution (10 mM phosphate sodium buffer solution, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl
and 1% BSA) at 4 °C until needed.

The samples for db DNA-based
ELISA were prepared by mixing capture probe functionalized MMPs with
target DNA in 50 μL of hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.05%
Tween 20) at room temperature for 30 min to ensure uniform coating.
A 5 μL portion of 1 μM detection probe conjugated with
U1 (formed with ssDNA U1–1′ and U1–2) was added
into the solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The
sample was washed with 50 μL of hybridization buffer three times
to remove excess and weakly bound detection probe. Then the U1 immobilized
MMPs was mixed with U1 and U2 (5 μL, 0.5 μM) successively
and repeatedly in 20 μL of hybridization buffer at room temperature
for 20 min every time and collected using a magnetic separator. After
addition of the db DNA units for 20 times in total (the last time
was biotin-labeled U2 (5 μL, 1 μM)), MMPs were rinsed
with washing buffer twice again and mixed with avidin–horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma) (20 μg/mL) in 50 μL of 1×
PBS buffer for at 37 °C 30 min. After being rinsed with 50 μL
of washing buffer seven times to remove the unbound avidin-HRP, 100
μL of substrate solution containing TMB (Sigma) was added and
mixed thoroughly and the mixture incubated at room temperature for
10 min before addition of 50 μL of stop solution (1 M H3PO4, Sigma). The magnetic beads were removed using
a magnetic separator, and the solution was moved to the 96-well plate
for analysis using a microplate reader at 450 nm.

Ethical Statement
All procedures performed in studies
involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards
of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the
1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical
standards. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the
“Measures on Ethical Review over Biomedical Research Involving
Human Subjects” (Ministry of Health, China, January 11, 2007).
All the samples were collected from patients after obtaining informed
consent, and the data from these patients were used in this study
only.

Clincal Samples
Fifty-four clinical samples were collected
in March 2018 from Adicon Clinical Laboratories (Hangzhou, China).
DNA was extracted from 200 μL of serum using a magnetic beads-based
method according to the provided instructions from the kit (Sansure
Biotech, China). The extracted HBV-DNA was characterized with a quantitative
PCR diagnostic kit (Sansure Biotech, Changsha, China) on an ABI 7500
real-time PCR system (2 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles at
95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s). Positive results were
defined according to the instruction supplied. The sensitivity of
the kit is 20 copies per reaction according to the instructions.

The hybridization process for HBV DNA detection included the following
steps: 200 μL of serum was used for HBV DNA extraction using
the magentic beads, and DNA was eluted with 20 μL of 0.1 TE.
The DNA was then denatured at 95 °C for 5 min to produce single-strand
DNA; the solution was cooled to 50 °C and mixed with 20 μL
of probe-functionalized microparticles for 30 min, followed by two
washes with 50 μL of PBS on a magnetic rack. The detection probe
conjugated with U1 (formed with ssDNA U1–1′ and U1–2)
was added into the solution and incubated at room temperature for
30 min. The hybridization process was repeated for 35 cycles. The
data for each sample are available in the Supporting Information. The capture probe and detection probe sequences
were designed following previous research.27 The threshold of each individual rational HCR assay was used to
define the limit of detection with respect to the negative controls
and was established as three standard deviations above the average
signal for all negative samples (0.121). Extrapolating the linear
fit of Figure 5 to
that threshold provides a theoretical limit of detection of three
copies, below the experimental limit, which is between 6 and 14.
