Multifunctional
wearable e-textiles have been a focus of much attention
due to their great potential for healthcare, sportswear, fitness,
space, and military applications. Among them, electroconductive textile
yarn shows great promise for use as next-generation flexible sensors
without compromising the properties and comfort of usual textiles.
However, the current manufacturing process of metal-based electroconductive
textile yarn is expensive, unscalable, and environmentally unfriendly.
Here we report a highly scalable and ultrafast production of graphene-based
flexible, washable, and bendable wearable textile sensors. We engineer
graphene flakes and their dispersions in order to select the best
formulation for wearable textile application. We then use a high-speed
yarn dyeing technique to dye (coat) textile yarn with graphene-based
inks. Such graphene-based yarns are then integrated into a knitted
structure as a flexible sensor and could send data wirelessly to a
device via a self-powered RFID or a low-powered Bluetooth.
The graphene textile sensor thus produced shows excellent temperature
sensitivity, very good washability, and extremely high flexibility.
Such a process could potentially be scaled up in a high-speed industrial
setup to produce tonnes (∼1000 kg/h) of electroconductive textile
yarns for next-generation wearable electronics applications.

==== Body
Wearable
electronics is a focal
point at the moment due to its potential applications as portable,
flexible, and stretchable human-interactive sensors, actuators, displays,
and energy storage devices.1−4 Smart wearable textiles have been going through significant
evolutions in recent years, through the innovation of wearable electronics5 and due to their miniaturization and the wireless
revolution. This has resulted in personalized wearable garments that
can interface with the human body and continuously monitor, collect,
and communicate various physiological parameters such as temperature,
humidity, heart rate, and activity monitoring.6,7 Such
a platform would potentially provide a solution to the overburdened
healthcare system resulting from a rapidly growing aging society as
well as maintaining and encouraging healthy and independent living
for all, irrelevant of time and location.8 However, current technologies for wearable garments are associated
with a number of challenges that other electronic technologies do
not face, such as the complex and time-consuming manufacturing process
of e-textiles and the use of expensive,9 nonbiodegradable,10 and unstable metallic
conductive materials. Apart from standard requirements for electronics
and sensing capabilities, there are requirements for such e-textiles
to be breathable, washable, flexible, wearable, and produced using
an environmentally friendly manufacturing process.11

The management of human body temperature to be as
near the normal
state (normothermia) as possible is considered to be crucial during
physical activity12 and anesthesia.13 Otherwise, hyperthermia (body temp >37 °C)
or hypothermia (body temp <36 °C) could potentially increase
the chance of bleeding, adverse cardiac events, wound infections,
and mortality rate, which results in increased hospital stays and
inflated costs.14−18 Therefore, it is important to monitor a patient’s body temperature
continuously and noninvasively to improve the neurological outcome
and reduce the mortality rate.19 Currently
several techniques20,21 and commercial products are available
to monitor body temperature. However, these are usually rigid, not
flexible, and not bendable.22 There have
been efforts to fabricate textile-based temperature sensors integrated
into a garment without compromising the properties and comfort of
the textiles.23,24 However, these are again metal-based
technologies and involve a complex manufacturing process of conductive
textiles with poor performance. Therefore, there remains a need for
conductive materials that could be used to manufacture environmentally
friendly, wearable, and breathable textile-based temperature sensors.

Graphene has attracted significant research interest for wearable
electronics applications due to its outstanding electrical, mechanical,
and thermal properties25−27 and its ability to act as a very good platform for
both interconnects and active devices (transistors and sensors).26 Moreover, graphene has superior thermal conductivity
compared with metals and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)28 and demonstrates the potential to circumvent the self-heating
problems of electronic devices at elevated temperature.29 Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a form of graphene,
can be produced in scalable quantities in a stable dispersion.6,7 Recent studies4,6,7,30,31 have highlighted
the use of rGO for wearable e-textiles applications, due to its ability
to interact with oxygen-containing groups in textile fibers. It would
therefore become part of the textiles rather than forming only a surface
coating.4 However, challenges with the
reported techniques are a multistage and time-consuming process,7,30 a higher temperature treatment of heat-sensitive textiles, and toxic
reducing agents.31 Several studies reported
graphene-based temperature sensors from CVD graphene on Si/SiO2 substrates,32 a gold-doped graphene-based
electrochemical device,33 solar exfoliated
reduced graphene oxide on polyimide substrates,13 graphene–graphene oxide (GO) hybrid films,29 and CVD graphene-assisted microfibers.34 However, these are not flexible, washable, and
bendable and are not suitable for wearable electronics applications.

Here, we report a highly scalable and ultrafast yarn dyeing technique
for the production of rGO-coated textile yarns and the use of those
yarns as flexible textile sensors. First, a range of graphene materials
such as reduced graphene oxides and graphene flakes (G) were synthesized
using rapid and environmentally friendly processes. In order to observe
the temperature sensitivity, the temperature dependence of the resistance
for individual rGO flakes, overlapping rGO flakes, drop-casted rGO
films, and free-standing rGO-coated yarns was tested. Moreover, the
use of a highly scalable yarn dyeing technique was demonstrated by
producing a batch of flexible, washable, and bendable rGO-coated yarns.
Such a manufacturing technique could potentially be scaled up to produce
tonnes of electroconductive graphene-based yarns using existing textile
machineries and without adding extra capital or production cost. The
coated (dyed) yarns were then integrated into a textile structure
by the most commonly used knitting technique and could be connected
to a self-powered radio frequency identification (RFID) tag or a low-powered
Bluetooth device. Such graphene-based yarns could also potentially
be used as various sensors in order to monitor the physiological conditions
of a human body without compromising the comfort and wearability of
smart textiles.

Results and Discussion
Engineering Graphene Flakes
for Wearable Sensors
rGO-based
wearable e-textiles are of great interest due to their ability to
create hydrogen or covalent bonds with cellulosic textile fibers,4 ultimately contributing to the improved durability
and washability of the final product. Moreover, rGO provides superior
dispersibility in polar solvents compared with graphene,35 due to the presence of residual functional groups
even after reduction. The dispersibility of rGO could be improved
by introducing an energy barrier to aggregation, through either covalent
or noncovalent interactions.36 Here, we
engineer the formulation and reduction conditions of rGO flakes. We
then use them as a temperature sensor platform to manufacture graphene-based
wearable textiles sensors in a scalable quantity. Graphene oxide (GO)
was synthesized using a modified Hummers method37 and chemically reduced to rGO by modifying our previously
reported methods.6,7 We used ascorbic acid (AA)38 and sodium hydrosulfite (SH)6 as reducing agents and optimized reduction conditions, i.e., time and temperature. The surface
of rGO flakes was functionalized using PSS/PVA to have better dispersibility
and prevent agglomeration.39 To compare
the performance, graphene-based inks were also exfoliated using a
highly scalable microfluidization technique.40,41 We used sodium dexoycholate (SDC) as a surfactant in order to disperse
G flakes in water through noncovalent bonding.42

To prove that our inks are fundamentally suitable
for temperature-sensing applications, we demonstrate the temperature
dependence of the conductance of the individual monolayer flakes. Figure 1a shows the temperature
dependence of the conductance of single-layer rGO (SH) flake (olive)
and the corresponding optical image of the device (top inset). In
the measured temperature range, the conductivity could be seen to
follow exponential behavior for a single-layer rGO flake unlike the
well-established model of standard variable range hopping.43,44 To model rGO inks (where multiple flakes overlap), we also measured
the temperature dependence of the conductance of the double-layer
rGO structure with two rGO monolayers partly overlapping each other
(bottom inset to Figure 1a). The corresponding temperature dependence, measured through the
overlapping region of the double layer structure, is shown by red
squares in Figure 1a. Similar to the single layer of the rGO, the temperature dependence
of the flake consisting of overlapping double layers follows similar
exponential dependence although with different characteristic temperature To and conductance Go, Figure 1a. This
suggests that one indeed can use rGO inks for temperature-sensing
applications, and the temperature sensitivity will be determined largely
by the conductivity of individual flakes, rather than by the transport
between flakes.

of conductance of graphene yarns: coated with rGO (SH) (olive), rGO
(AA) (blue), and G flakes (black). The black dashed lines correspond
to the fittings of exponential dependence (Table S2).

In order to check the
temperature dependence of the ink, we drop-casted
rGO on the Si/SiO2 wafer and performed two-probe measurements
of the conductance in the range of 150 to 300 K in order to test if
the obtained temperature dependence is preserved for the “multiple
overlapping” flakes obtained from the drop-casting. Figure 1c demonstrates an
example of the I–V characteristics, measured
in the range of 150 to 300 K for the particular rGO sample with the
SH reducing agent, reduction time of 24 h, and 1:5 GO to PSS polymer
ratio. Figure 1d shows
the extracted temperature dependence of the conductance of the zero-bias
conductivity of drop-casted rGO (SH)
devices, which also follows the exponential dependence of  for all the
devices tested, but with different
characteristic parameters of temperature, To, and conductance, Go. We then performed
the temperature dependence measurements of two-probe conductance
for rGO (SH), rGO (AA), and G flakes-coated yarn, Figure 1e, and obtained a similar dependence
to that for the samples drop-casted on a Si/SiO2 substrate.

Now, as we proved that our rGO suspensions can in principle be
used for temperature-sensing applications, we focus on the optimization
of the inks in terms of their temperature response as well as manufacturability.
We characterized the morphology of the graphene materials, and the
optical images show that the mean lateral dimensions of GO, rGO (AA),
rGO (SH), and G flakes are ∼5.85, ∼4.36, ∼4.86,
and ∼1.45 μm, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The statistical analysis of atomic
force microscopy (AFM) images reveals that the average flake thickness
(h) of GO, rGO (AA), and rGO (SH) is ∼2.07,
∼2.27, and ∼2.21 nm, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S3), whereas we obtain few-layer graphene
by microfluidization, as 20% of G flakes are <10 nm in thickness.
The Raman spectra of G flakes show a characteristic D peak at ∼1350
cm–1, G peak at ∼1582 cm–1, and an asymmetric 2D band at ∼2730 cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S4),45 whereas D and G peaks are prominent for GO and
rGO. The intensity ratio of the D and G band (ID/IG) increased after reduction
from GO to rGO, Table S1, indicating the
generation of a large number of sp2 domains.46 Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis shows that the C/O ratio is found to be the highest for G
flakes (∼24.84), as expected, and increased up to ∼6.6
(for rGO) from ∼2.4 (GO) as the oxygen content decreases after
reduction.

We synthesized a range of graphene materials in order
to find the
best formulation for textile temperature sensor applications. We made
48 formulations in order to optimize the GO reduction for both AA
and SH using various reduction times (12, 24, 48, 72 h) and four stoichiometric
ratios (1:0, 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10) between GO and polymers (PSS/PVA). Figures S5–S7 show the aggregation of
rGO flakes without or with a very small amount of polymer (1:0 and
1:1). However, the addition of polymers (1:5 and 1:10 ratios) significantly
improves the dispersibility of rGO.6Figure 2a,b show that To decreases with an increase in reduction time
for most rGO samples, which means that the conductivity increases
with the increase of reduction time as expected. In particular, rGO
(SH) samples require shorter reduction time to achieve higher conductivity
(Table S2, Supporting Information). Moreover,
the higher intensity ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) from Raman spectra and C/O
ratio from XPS analysis indicates better reduction with SH. These
results are in good agreement with conductivity results as the highest ID/IG (∼1.73)
and C/O (∼6.59) achieved for rGO (SH) samples with 1:10 ratio
and 24 h reduction times. In addition, Figure 2d,e show that rGO
(SH) samples achieve higher ID/IG and C/O ratios and also require a shorter
reduction time than that of rGO (AA) samples, due to the generation
of a large number of sp2 domains. This could be due to
the mild reductive ability of l-ascorbic acid that takes
a longer time to restore the electronics conjugation state.47 Unlike l-AA, SH decomposes rapidly
in aqueous solution at higher temperature and attacks epoxide and
hydroxyl groups of GO to form rGO by hydrothermal reaction. Moreover,
the color of the GO dispersion changes to black immediately after
adding SH, which also demonstrates a better reduction ability of SH
than l-AA.6,48

Ultrafast Yarn Dyeing of
Highly Washable and Ultraflexible Graphene
Yarn
One of the major challenges for wearable e-textile fabrication
is the ability to produce conductive textiles in scalable quantities.
We have addressed this to some extent in our previous study6 on the scalable production of graphene-based
conductive fabrics with the potential to produce graphene e-textiles
at commercial production rates of ∼150 m/min. However, it is
also desirable to produce conductive textile yarn (rather than fabric)
and then integrate such yarns into a fabric structure by knitting,
weaving, or embroidery. The textiles sensors thus produced achieve
better comfort, mobility, usability, and aesthetic properties.49,50 Moreover, the process will provide the flexibility of producing
sensors with preferred designs, structures, and properties.51 However, further development is necessary, as
current metal-based or other technologies to produce conductive yarn
are neither scalable and durable nor flexible.49,51,52

Here we report a highly scalable and
ultrafast yarn dyeing technique to produce graphene-based conductive
yarn in a scalable quantity for textile sensor applications. At first,
we used a simple dip-coating technique to optimize the coating time,
number of coating cycles, and curing time and temperature for rGO-coated
conductive yarn, Figure 3. Figure 3a shows
that the resistance per cm of rGO (SH)-coated yarn decreases rapidly
with the increase of coating time. We used 30 min as an optimized
coating time in order to observe the effect of the number of coating
cycles on the resistance of conductive textile yarn. Note that all
the samples were dried at 100 °C after each coating cycle. As
expected, the resistance of conductive yarn decreases with the increase
in number of coating cycles due to the deposition of an increased
amount of rGO flakes on the yarn surface.6 The resistance decreases rapidly up to 3 coating cycles to ∼42.7
kΩ/cm, and there are very small changes with a further coating, Figure 3b. This may be due
to the absorption of a significant amount of rGO flakes into surface-pretreated
100% cotton yarns during the first 3 coating (dyeing) cycles. After
that, it may almost reach a saturation point, and the resistance of
the coated yarn slightly decreases with the increase of the number
of coating cycles. Considering the trade-off between the conductivity
and coating cycle number, we use 3 cycles of rGO coating for subsequent
experiments.

(coated) cotton yarn. (i) Highly flexible graphene-coated yarn wrapped
around a cone.

Figure 3c shows
the effect of curing conditions on the resistance of rGO-coated yarn
and demonstrates the significant effect of curing
temperature and time on the conductivity of coated yarn. The resistance
decreases significantly with the increase in curing temperature and
time due to the volatilization of the residual solvent.53 Moreover, the efficient charge transport is
achieved at a higher temperature by reducing the contact resistance
through the rGO flake network. However, the strength of the cotton
fiber decreases significantly at a higher curing temperature (above
140 °C) due to the intramacromolecular cross-linking and depolymerization
of cellulose.54 On the basis of our previous
study and the usual curing temperature for fabric finishing or dyeing
or printing,55 we have chosen 150 °C
for 3 min as the optimized curing conditions for the batch production
of graphene-based yarn, and no significant variation in yarn strength
is observed after curing. However, these problems were not addressed
in previous studies on graphene-based e-textiles with a higher post-reduction
temperature of GO-coated textiles or chemical reduction with a toxic
reducing agent such as hydrazine hydrate and hydroiodic acid.56,57

In order to produce graphene-based conductive textile yarn
in scalable
quantity, we use a batch yarn dyeing (also referred to as “exhaust dyeing”) technique to coat graphene onto
textile yarn. The batch dyeing technique is one of the most commonly
used techniques in the textile industry to dye textiles in any format
such as yarn, fabric, and garments. It can dye tonnes (∼1000
kg) of cotton textile yarns in just 30 min and provides even dye distribution,
levelness of shade (color), and wash fastness. In this study, we mimic
the batch yarn dyeing technique by coating a hank of yarn using a
laboratory-scale batch dyeing machine. First, rGO (SH) ink was synthesized
in a scalable quantity by reducing GO rapidly, Figure 3d. After that, a hank of cotton yarn was
dyed with rGO (SH) inks by following the dyeing cycle as illustrated
in Figure 3e. Such
a process could potentially be scaled up with an industrial scale
yarn dyeing machine, Figure 3f, and produce tonnes of graphene-based conductive yarn in
a cost-effective manner. Figure 3g shows a hank of scoured–bleached 100% cotton
white yarn, which is dyed (coated) with rGO in a batch dyeing machine
at 60 °C for 30 min and subsequently dried at a lower drying
temperature (100 °C) and cured at 150 °C for 3 min to produce
conductive textile yarns, Figure 3h. Thus, produced graphene-based textile yarns are
as ultraflexible (easily wrapped around a cone, Figure 3i) as untreated yarn, durable, and comfortable.

The wash stability of wearable e-textiles is extremely important
for daily use. The wash stability of rGO-coated yarn was investigated
and compared with that of G flakes-coated yarn. A British standard
(BS EN ISO 105 C06 A1S) test procedure and SDC ECE reference detergent
B that contains phosphate were used. The graphene-coated yarn was
exposed to mechanical agitation (by 10 steel balls) and washing powder
during a simulated home laundry wash. Our rGO-coated yarns can sustain
a number of washings and are still conductive after 10 washing cycles.
After each washing, the resistance of rGO-coated yarn increases slightly
up to 6 cycles, Figure 4a, due to the removal of unfixed rGO flakes from the surface.6 The SEM image of untreated cotton yarn shows
smooth featureless fibers, Figure 4b. After rGO coating, the individual fibers are wrapped
with rGO flakes with a very uniform coating, Figure 4c. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish
rGO flakes from the fiber unless there are unfixed rGO flakes on the
fiber surface due to defects in coating, Figure 4d. These unfixed flakes are removed during
washing cycles (Supporting Information, Figure S16b) and possibly increase the resistance of rGO-coated yarns
after each washing cycle. However, the wash stability could further
be increased by a fine encapsulation layer on the yarn surface. Unlike
rGO yarns, the wash stability of G-coated yarn is found to be very
poor, as the resistance increases rapidly after each wash. It loses
electrical conductivity after 3 washing cycles, due to the removal
of G flakes from the yarn surface, Figure 4a. SEM images of G-coated yarn show that
a large number of G flakes are loosely attached to the fiber surfaces
(Figure 4e), which
were removed during the mechanical agitation created by washing (Supporting
Information, Figure S16c,d).

C (1s) XPS spectrum of G flakes. All the scale bar on SEM images are
5 μm.

XPS analyses of rGO and
G inks provide further evidence for better
wash stability of rGO yarns and the poor wash stability of G yarns.
As seen from the wide-scan spectra of graphene materials in Figure 4f, GO contains a
significant amount of oxygen (∼29.4%), which decreases with
the reduction, whereas G flakes contain a very small amount of oxygen
(∼3.7), almost the same as graphite. High-resolution XPS analysis
shows that GO contains oxygen functional groups such as C–O epoxy and alkoxy groups
(∼286.4 eV) and C=O carbonyl groups (∼288 eV),7Figure 4g. After reduction to rGO, such oxygen-containing functional
groups are almost diminished with a small number of residual oxygen
functional groups left around 288.5 eV, Figure 4h. These residual functional groups of rGO
create covalent or hydrogen bonding with the fibers and impart better
wash stability. However, no such oxygen functional
groups are observed in high-resolution spectra of G flakes (Figure 4i), which is mainly
dominated by C–C/C=C and very similar to graphite. Therefore,
G yarns provide poor wash stability.

Knitted Temperature Sensors
and Characterization
An
automatic knitting technique was used to provide a scaffold for the
placement of the graphene-coated yarn sensor. Such automated knitting
technology allows the sensor construction to be a part of the garment
manufacturing process and thereby facilitates the accurate placement
of any sensor geometry anywhere in the garment. Through this advanced
knitting technique, the sensor manufacturing is standardized to ensure
repeatability of the sensor manufacturing and thereby its performance.
A knitted structure provides the base for introducing graphene yarn
as a temperature sensor. In order to provide the graphene-coated temperature
sensor yarn with the most stable knitted scaffold, it was constructed
to have an interlock structure made of double-covered yarn with a
Lycra filament core and a nylon filament covering, Figure 5a,b. The interlock structure,
due to its high resistance to structural deformation, offers the best
dynamically stable scaffold or background structure to carry the sensor
yarn. In order to improve the sensor performance, we assembled the
sensor yarn course in such a way that it contains a tubular structure
with graphene yarn only on the front side of the tubular knitted courses, Figure 5b.

structure used as a scaffold for the placement of graphene yarn as
a temperature sensor. (c) Yarn path notation diagram for knitted temperature
sensors. (d) Temperature dependence of the resistance of the knitted
sensor showing almost a linear change with a negative temperature
coefficient. (e) Cyclic test of the knitted sensor’s temperature
sensitivity between 25 and 55 °C showing excellent repeatability.
(f) Time response property of the knitted temperature sensor.

Since the graphene-coated yarn
is a short fiber cotton yarn, if
the yarn is integrated as a straight laid-in yarn, it is possible
that the yarn may experience some permanent deformation during the
fabric handling. Such an occurrence would have the capacity to change
the yarn properties that are defined in its electromechanical characterization.
Therefore, the graphene-coated sensor yarns were introduced as a plain
knitted structure, which is in effect a series of yarn loops that
help to prevent any changes to the yarn properties during usage. Patches
of silver yarn knitted structures were also assembled on either side
of the knitted courses of graphene yarn to provide bus bars, Figure 5a. Such bus bars
are in fact low-resistance electrodes for the conductive pathways
to feed the electrical signals to the control unit. Figure 5c shows the yarn path notation
diagram for the knitted temperature sensor, where the design repeat
is from one blue knitted course to the other blue knitted course.

Figure 5d shows
the temperature-sensing performance of the graphene-based knitted
temperature sensor in Figure 5a. It can be seen that the resistance of this sensor is decreasing
almost at a constant rate with the increase of temperature from 20
°C to around ∼60 °C. The effect of the temperature
on the resistance of the knitted sensor is similar to what has been
observed for thermally58 and chemically59 reduced GO films. Figure 5e confirms a good temperature-sensing stability
of this sample in a cyclic test between 25 and 55 °C. The longer
time of temperature decrease from 55 °C to 25 °C is due
to the slow cooling speed of the oven. Figure 5f shows the time response property of the
knitted temperature sensor, when the temperature is increased from
25 °C to 55 °C by transferring the knitted sample from the
oven (55 °C) to room temperature (25 °C).

Smart Wearable
Garment with Ultraflexible Graphene-Based Wireless
Sensors
We further investigate the flexibility of graphene-based
yarns under bending and compression. Figure 6a shows a repeatable response for bending
(concave downward) in forward (bending) and reverse (bending back)
directions. Similarly for compression with a concave upward position,
the change in resistance of the rGO yarns is repeatable in both the
forward (compression) and reverse (compression back) directions (Figure 6b). Moreover, the
variation in the resistance is almost stable up to 1000 bending–releasing
and compression–releasing cycles, Figure 6c. Similarly, the resistance changes barely
after 10 repeated folding–releasing operations (Figure 6d) when subject to the more
violent deformation of folding. Moreover, excellent adhesion is observed,
as no materials come off the surface of graphene-coated yarns. We
do not observe creasing or a change of shape of the yarns due to these
aggressive mechanical actions such as folding, bending, and compression.
This demonstrates excellent flexibility of the graphene-based yarns
and their great promise for wearable and bendable electronics applications.

The “zero-power”
RFID technology has been the heart
of passive, low-cost, and low-maintenance wireless sensors.60 With growing applications of the Internet of
Things (IoT), it is estimated that wireless sensors and actuators
will account for the majority of the IoT devices, due to their ability
to be self-powered while monitoring physical parameters and transmitting
data.61 RFID-based sensor networks could
potentially become the ultimate sensing tool and find a plethora of
applications in the future world of artificial intelligence. Here,
we illustrate a concept smart garment (Figure 6e) that could be integrated with a knitted
temperature sensor or other wireless sensors (such as but not limited
to strain, pressure, and humidity) and an RFID tag and send the temperature
data to a mobile app via an NFC reader. This could
also be connected with a low-power Bluetooth device to transmit data
to a device.

Conclusions
We
report a highly scalable and ultrafast production of graphene-based
textile yarns that could be used for next-generation wearable electronics
applications. The graphene-based electroconductive yarns thus produced
are flexible, washable, and bendable and show excellent temperature
sensitivity and cyclability when integrated into a knitted textile
structure. We demonstrate the potential integration of self-powered
RFID with knitted temperature sensors, monitoring of human body temperature
as required and sending this to a data collection unit. We believe
our ultrafast production process would be an important step toward
realizing multifunctional applications of wearable e-textiles for
next-generation medical devices, sportswear, fashion, fitness, and
military goods.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Flake graphite grade 3061 and grade 2736
were kindly supplied by Asbury Graphite Mills, USA, and Graphexel
Limited, UK, respectively. Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, Mw ∼70 000, powder), sodium deoxycholate
(SDC), l-ascorbic acid (∼99%), sodium hydrosulfite
(∼82%), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mw ∼31 000–50 000, 98–99%), ammonia,
potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, ∼99%), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, ∼30%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK,
and used as received. Surface-pretreated (scoured and bleached) 100%
cotton yarn from the University of Manchester textiles laboratory
was used.

Synthesis of Graphene Materials
A modified Hummers
method and microfluidization technique were used to prepare graphene
oxide37 and few-layer graphene-based inks
(G flakes),40 respectively. Our previously
reported methods were modified for chemically reducing GO to rGO.6,7 Briefly, 160 mg of GO was added to 160 mL of deionized (DI) water
and sonicated for 30 min to make a 1 mg/mL brown dispersion of GO,
which was transferred to a round-bottom flask placed in an oil bath.
PVA and PSS polymers were added in various stoichiometric ratios (1:0,
1:1, 1:5, and 1:10) to the GO dispersion by rigorous stirring in order
to make a stable dispersion. Environmentally friendly l-AA
and SH (1.22 g) were used as reducing agents in order to reduce GO
to rGO (SH) PSS, rGO (AA) PVA, and rGO (AA) PSS. The bath pH was maintained
at 9–10 by adding a sufficient amount of ammonia solution.
The mixture was then held for 12–72 h under closed conditions
in order to obtain a black dispersion of rGO. This black dispersion
was washed several times to remove any residuals and finally diluted
into DI water to adjust the rGO dispersion concentration to ∼1.9
mg/mL.

Device Fabrication and Electrical Measurements
The
G and rGO flakes were drop-casted on Si/SiO2 (290 nm oxide
on plain silicon) and printed electronic paper (PEL) using a micropipet
(1–10 μL) and manually bonded using silver paste for
two-probe electrical characterization. The devices with single and
double flakes were prepared by the usual dry transfer procedure followed
by standard e-beam lithography. The electrical measurements were performed
in a 4He cryostat from 150 to 300 K. Source voltage was
swept, and the current was measured using a Keithley 2614B source
meter.

Coating and Dyeing of Textile Yarn with Graphene-Based Inks
A simple dip coating was used in order to optimize the coating
and curing conditions such as coating time, number of coating cycles,
curing time, and temperature. First, a scoured–bleached cotton
yarn was coated with an rGO dispersion (∼1.9 mg/mL) for 1–30
min, and resistance per cm length of coated yarn was measured using
a multimeter (DL9309 Auto Ranging multimeter, Di-Log, UK). The optimized
coating time was used to coat yarn with the same rGO dispersion for
a number of coating cycles (up to 10). Then the effect of the curing
time (5–30 min) and the curing temperature (100–200
°C) on the resistance of the rGO-coated yarn was observed and
optimized.

Fabrication of Knitted Sensor and Wireless
Temperature Monitoring
The fabrication of the wearable temperature
sensor was accomplished
using a SES-122S 10gg Shima Seiki (Japan) computer-controlled electronic
flatbed knitting technology. The electromechanical characterization
of the graphene-based knitted sensor structure was carried out using
a Z/050 Zwick-Roell tensile tester (Zwick Roell Group, Germany) connected
with NI-9219 National Instrument data acquisition technology (NI,
American). The characterization allowed a vision into selecting the
optimum knitting parameters for the sensor structure and the knowledge
of the best working region in the characteristic curve of the sensor
when it is used in a wearable sensor garment.

Characterization
The graphene dispersions were diluted
1000 times and drop-casted on Si/SiO2 (290 nm oxide on
plain silicon) for flake size, flake thickness, and Raman analysis.
The images and spectra were taken from 10 different locations on the
sample and averages calculated. The flake size was measured using
images from a high-definition optical microscope (Nikon DS–Ri2,
Japan). The surface topography of the untreated and graphene materials-coated
yarns was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images
from Zeiss Ultra SEM. The flake thickness of GO and rGO was measured
using a Dimension Icon (Bruker) atomic force microscope. Raman spectra
were collected using a Renishaw Raman System equipped with a 633 nm
laser. A Kratos Axis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system was used
to characterize the surface functionality of GO, rGO, and G flakes
and also untreated and graphene-coated yarn. The wash stability of
graphene material-coated cotton yarn was assessed according to BS
EN ISO 105 C06 A1S as previously reported.6

The electrical response of the knitted temperature sensor
was tested with an Ivium portable electrochemical interface and impedance
analyzer (USA). An oven was used to control the temperature of the
knitted sample, and a thermocouple was used to measure the inside
temperature. We used various cord lengths during bending (concave
down) and compression (concave upward) to measure the change of resistance
of rGO-coated yarns (10 cm length). A Zwick/Roell tensile tester (Zwick
Roell Group, Germany) was used to control the cord length during bending
and compression tests in both the forward and reverse directions.
The change of the resistance with the change of cord lengths of rGO-coated
yarns during bending and compression was captured using a National
Instrument 9219 data acquisition card (NI, American).
