We
found that continuous films of gold (Au) on oxidized silicon
(SiO2) substrates, upon treatment with ultraviolet (UV)-ozone,
exhibit strong adhesion to the SiO2 support. Importantly,
the enhancement is independent of micro- or nanostructuring of such
nanometer-thick films. Deposition of a second Au layer on top of the
pretreated Au layer makes the adhesion stable for at least 5 months
in environmental air. Using this treatment method enables us to large-scale
fabricate various SiO2-supported Au structures at various
thicknesses with dimensions spanning from a few hundreds of nanometers
to a few micrometers, without the use of additional adhesion layers.
We explain the observed adhesion improvement as polarization-induced
increased strength of Auδ−Siδ+ bonds at the Au–SiO2 interface due to the formation
of a gold oxide monolayer on the Au surface by the UV-ozone treatment.
Our simple and enabling method thus provides opportunities for patterning
Au micro/nanostructures on SiO2 substrates without an intermediate
metallic adhesion layer, which is critical for biosensing and nanophotonic
applications.

==== Body
Micro/nanostructures
made of
Au supported on fused-silica or oxidized silicon (SiO2)
substrates have attracted much interest in recent years due to their
wide range of potential applications such as chemical and biological
sensors,1−3 optical devices,4−6 localized surface plasmon
resonance spectroscopy,7 and surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS).8 However, fabrication
of such structures has been considered challenging, due to the inherently
poor adhesion of Au to SiO2.9 Generally, an additional metallic adhesion layer, for example, titanium
(Ti) or chromium (Cr), is used to improve the adhesion of the Au films.
However, it is reported that such adhesion metals deteriorate the
optical and electrical properties of pure Au.10−12 Various other
methods have been explored to enhance the adhesion of Au on substrates
such as plasma treatment of the substrates with different gases,13,14 postirradiation of deposited Au films with high energetic ion beam,15 and spin-casting of organic layers.16−18 Treating the substrate with a plasma before the Au deposition, e.g., Ar/H2O plasma,13 Ar plasma,14 or SF6/O2 plasma,19 can increase
the surface wettability and/or the surface roughness in nanoscale
of the substrates, thus improving the Au adhesion. Although being
easy to operate, the plasma treatment method is mostly used for polymer
substrates, e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) and polyethylene (PE), as their surface properties can be easily
modified by the plasma. Irradiating the deposited Au films with high
energetic ion beams, e.g., 0.1 MeV
Kr ion beam20 or 15 MeV Cl+ ion
beam,21 can also result in a good adhesion,
which is attributed to an increase in the wetting of the gold at the
substrate interface. However, this method requires a complex treatment
process and a dedicated system. Spin-casting of organic layers, e.g., amino- and mercaptosilanes17 or silk protein,18 used as an adhesion layer provides an opportunity to pattern ultrathin
and ultrasmooth Au layers well-adhered to the substrates, but in this
case an additional layer is required.

In this paper, we report
a method to significantly enhance the
adhesion of deposited Au films to SiO2 substrates, by using
a postdeposition UV-ozone treatment. The paper is structured into
three sections. In the first section, we describe how postdeposition
treatment of SiO2-supported Au films with UV-ozone results
in an exceptional increase in their adhesion strength, compared to
an untreated Au film. Deposition of a second Au film on top of the
pretreated Au film is furthermore found to strongly extend the duration
of adhesion. In the second section, we show that this treatment method
can be used to fabricate various well-adhering Au micro/nanostructures
at various thicknesses on SiO2 substrates, without any
additional adhesion layers. In the third section, we propose the mechanism
causing this adhesion enhancement, which is an increased strength
of Auδ−Siδ+ bonds at the
Au–SiO2 interface due to the formation of a charge-polarized
gold oxide layer on the Au surface upon UV-ozone treatment.

Results
and Discussion
Strength of the Adhesion
Au microdot
arrays were patterned
directly on the surface of oxidized Si wafers using a shadow mask
(Figure 1a and Figures S1–S3). Their adhesion was measured
with a modified tape test using a second Au layer sputtered on the
microdot array (Figure 1b,c). The adhesion strength was quantified by comparing the remaining
Au area after the tape test to the initial area of the patterned Au
microdots. Different experimental sequences (“cases”)
were conducted for investigating the Au adhesion to the SiO2 substrate, as given in Table 1.

Figure 2 shows
the
fraction of remaining Au area as a function of the diameter of fabricated
Au microdots after the tape test for the cases 1–4 of Table 1. Without the UV-ozone
treatment (case 1), the Au microdots of all diameters were completely
removed (Figure S4), thus indicating the
inherently poor adhesion of Au to SiO2.9 With the 5 min UV-ozone treatment (case 2), now between
83% and 96% of Au area remained attached, depending on the Au microdot
diameter (Figures S5–S7). The dependence
on the microdot area is attributed to partial removal at the microdot
edges (important for the small microdots) and a large contact area
with the continuous second Au layer (important for the larger microdots).
Immersion in DI water for 10 min (case 3, Figures
S8–S10) did not noticeably affect the adhesion.

Figure 2 Fraction of
remaining Au area versus the diameter
or area-to-perimeter ratio of Au microdots after the tape test for
cases 1–4 (see Table 1). Case 1: ∼13 nm thick Au microdots without the UV-ozone
treatment. Case 2: ∼13 nm thick Au microdots treated with UV-ozone
for 5 min. Case 3: ∼13 nm thick Au microdots with the 5 min
UV-ozone treatment and immersion in DI water for 10 min. Case 4: ∼24
nm thick Au microdots treated with UV-ozone for 5 min.

Increasing the thickness of the Au microdots to
approximately 24
nm results in a decrease in the adhesion strength (case 4, Figures S11–S13), thus indicating the dependence
of the adhesion effect on the Au thickness. We found in this case
that the center part of almost all Au microdots was removed, leaving
only their circumference on the SiO2 surface, especially
for large Au microdots.

Importantly, deposition of a second
Au layer on top of the pretreated
Au layer of ∼13 nm thick caused the adhesion to remain stable
in the environmental air for more than 5 months (Figures S14 and S15). This observation, which is considered
in more detail in the mechanism section, allowed stable patterning
of well-adhering thick gold layers without additional adhesion layers,
which we used for micro/nanopatterning of various Au structures.

Patterning Gold Micro/Nanostructures on Oxidized Silicon Substrates
Au micro/nanostructures with a stable and strong adhesion to the
surface of oxidized Si wafers could be manufactured by a combination
of lithography with a two-step sputtering process of stacked Au layers
and an intermediate UV-ozone treatment (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Fabrication process for patterning well-adhering
Au nanostructures
supported directly on the surface of oxidized Si wafers, without additional
adhesion layers.

Figure 4a,b show
the top-view optical images of Au microdots and lines of ∼37
nm thickness, patterned directly on the surface of oxidized Si wafers.
The patterns were well-defined over large areas of 5 × 5 mm2, with high uniformity and good adhesion. It is noteworthy
that there were no defects observed in the patterned structures, indicating
that the Au adhesion to the oxidized Si substrate remained stable
during all processing steps. Without applying the UV-ozone treatment,
removal of multiple Au microdots was observed (Figure S16). Also, a ∼90 nm thick Au layer sputtered
on a UV-ozone treated ∼13 nm thick Au layer showed stable adhesion,
which could be patterned using wet etching (Figure
S17).

Au microdots (∼2 μm diameter), (b) Au microlines (∼2
μm width) with the inserted top-view HR-SEM images (scale bar:

periodic (c) Au nanodots (∼346 nm diameter), (d) Au nanolines
(∼286 nm width) with the inset close-up HR-SEM images (scale
bar: 1 μm).

Moreover, using the UV-ozone
treatment also enables the large-area
fabrication of various SiO2-supported Au nanostructures,
without the use of additional adhesion layers. The top-view high-resolution
scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) images (Figure 4c,d) show well-defined patterns of Au nanodots
and lines of ∼37 nm thickness, which are well-adhered to the
surface of oxidized Si wafers. In addition, the postdeposition UV-ozone
treatment provides a direct way of patterning Au structures on oxidized
Si substrates from a thin Au layer less than 13 nm thick by using
patterned UV-ozone exposure and thereby controlling the formation
areas of gold oxide (Figure S18 and Video S1).

Interestingly, we also observed
an enhancement in the adhesion
of Pt to SiO2 after UV-ozone treatment. Although no further
characterization has been performed, we used this treatment to pattern
Pt nanodots and lines supported directly on the surface of oxidized
Si wafers (Figure S19).22

Patterning Gold Nanostructures on Other Substrates
We also applied the UV-ozone treatment to pattern Au nanodots and
lines directly on the surface of other substrates, i.e., silicon nitride (SiN, ∼50 nm thick)-coated
Si substrates, MEMpax glass substrates, sapphire glass substrates,
and indium tin oxide (ITO, ∼100 nm thick)-coated MEMpax glass
substrates (Figure 5). This successful nanopatterning indicates that the postdeposition
UV-ozone treatment might also provide good adhesion of the Au to these
substrate materials, although no measurements of the increase in the
adhesion strength of Au to these substrates have been performed. It
has to be noted that the relatively rough surface of these used substrates
probably also contributed to the Au adhesion enhancement, especially
in the case of the SiN-coated Si substrates, the sapphire glass substrates,
and the ITO-coated MEMpax glass substrates. Therefore, further investigation
of the influence of the surface roughness on the adhesion of Au to
these substrates is necessary.

1 μm) of periodic
Au nanodots and lines supported directly on the surface of different
substrates. (b) AFM images (1 × 1 μm2) of the

Mechanism of the Adhesion
Enhancement
As the mechanism
for the adhesion enhancement, we propose a polarization-induced increased
interaction strength at the Au–SiO2 interface when
gold oxide is formed at the air–Au interface during UV-ozone
treatment (Figure 6). The reaction of oxygen with Au surfaces has been reported to induce
the transfer of electrons from the Au bulk into the adsorbed oxygen
layer.23 This electron transfer has also
been described by Sun etal.,24 where details of the interaction of adsorbed
atomic oxygen with Au surface atoms were studied intensively using
the Hückel theory and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Figure 6 Schematic
diagrams of the mechanism for the adhesion enhancement
of (a) ∼13 nm thick Au microdots and (b) ∼24 nm thick
Au microdots with the oxidized Si substrate, using the UV-ozone treatment.

We hypothesize that this electron
transfer causes an increased
Au–Si bonding strength at the Au–SiO2 interface.
This hypothesis is schematically depicted in Figure 6 and is based on the work of Bauer etal.25 and
Sun etal.26 These authors investigated the interaction between Au and SiO2, the former authors by soft-X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
and the latter by DFT. Both reported evidence for the formation of
Au–Si bonds with a polarization Auδ−Siδ+. As this polarization implies partial electron
transfer to the Au layer, we expect that these Au–Si bonds
will be strengthened when gold surface oxidation causes partial electron
transfer from the Au to the bound oxygen.

The formation and
removal of gold oxide was confirmed by different
methods. Ellipsometer data obtained after 5 min UV-ozone treatment
were in accordance with the growth of a gold oxide layer of approximately
2.0 ± 0.2 Å, consistent with the approximate thickness (2
Å) of a monolayer of Au–O bonds.27 The change in the peak intensity of the reflectance spectrum measured
on the Au surface after the UV-ozone treatment (Figures S20 and S21) without a significant change in the Au
surface roughness is consistent with the formation/reduction of a
gold oxide layer.27−29 Measurements of the contact angle (CA) of a DI water
drop on a Au surface after the UV-ozone treatment were also in accordance
with the formation of a gold oxide layer (Figure
S22).27

It is known that gold
oxide is reduced in ethanol.27,30 We therefore immersed
the UV-ozone-treated Au microdots in ethanol
for 10 min and found that the enhanced adhesion had vanished (case
5, Figure 7 and Figure S23). Re-treating the sample with UV-ozone
restored the adhesion, though with a considerable drop in the adhesion
strength, especially for small Au microdots (case 6, Figure 7 and Figures
S24–S26). Our measured CA of a DI water drop on a Au
film re-treated with UV-ozone also indicates the renewed formation
of a gold oxide layer (Figure S22).

Figure 7 Fraction of
remaining Au area versus the diameter
or area-to-perimeter ratio of Au microdots after the tape test for
cases 5–8 (see Table 1). Case 5: ∼13 nm thick Au microdots with the 5 min
UV-ozone treatment and immersion in ethanol for 10 min. Case 6: re-treating
the sample of case 5 with UV-ozone for 5 min. Case 7: ∼13 nm
thick Au microdots treated with UV-ozone for 5 min and stored for
2 weeks. Case 8: stacked-layer Au microdots sonicated at room temperature
in ethanol for 2 h.

Decomposition of gold
oxide over time in the environment is reported
in the literature.31 Therefore, an oxidized
Si wafer with UV-ozone-treated Au microdots was stored in environmental
air for 2 weeks before the tape test (case 7, Figure 7). Figure 7 shows that all fabricated Au microdots were removed
after the tape test (Figure S27), indicating
the loss of the adhesion strength over time in environmental air,
consistent with a gold oxide origin of the effect.

Deposition
of a second Au layer on top of the pretreated Au layer
of ∼13 nm thickness resulted in a major extension in the duration
of its adhesion to the SiO2 substrate. The adhesion of
stacked Au layers remained stable in environmental air (cleanroom
relative humidity: 45 ± 10%) for more than 5 months (Figures S14 and S15). Arrays of Au microdots fabricated
using this stacked Au layer configuration were found to pass the tape
test after sonication at room temperature in ethanol for 2 h (case
8, Figure 7 and Figure S28). This is consistent with an embedded
gold oxide layer that is insensitive to reduction during the sonication.
A stable and strong adhesion of these Au microdots to the SiO2 surface was obtained (Figures S29–S31). It is worth noticing that the embedded gold oxide layer could
not be seen in an image recorded with transmission electron microscopy
(Figure S32), probably due to its extremely
low thickness of 2.0 ± 0.2 Å measured by ellipsometry.

A further experiment supported our hypothesis of a charge-based
mechanism for the adhesion. We applied an electrical potential in
water (Figure S33) to stacked Au films (a
∼24 nm Au layer sputtered on a UV-ozone-treated ∼13
nm Au layer), supported on amorphous fused-silica substrates. Applying
a negative potential to the stacked Au films resulted in their immediate
detachment from the SiO2 support, whereas they remained
attached upon applying a positive potential. We attribute this detachment
to the destabilization of the Auδ−Siδ+ bonds at the Au–SiO2 interface by the additional
negative charges. Reaction of Au with Si at the Au–SiO2 interface was eliminated, as no increase in the surface roughness
of the SiO2 substrate after removing the UV-ozone-treated
Au film occurred (Figure S34).

Using
UV-ozone treatment for 5 min, we found that the center part
of almost all ∼24 nm thick Au microdots was removed, leaving
only their circumference on the SiO2 surface, especially
for large Au microdots (Figures S11–S13). We can explain this observation by the hypothesis that the charge
polarization at the Au–SiO2 interface caused by
the formation of the gold oxide on the Au surface becomes insignificant
at this thickness. Only the adhesion effect at the perimeter of the
Au microdots, where the gold oxide is located closer to the substrate,
for a certain distance remained in this case, as conceptually shown
in Figure 6b.

However, treating with O2 plasma conducted at 500 W
for 10 min using a plasma system (TePla 300, PAV TePla AG, Germany)
could increase the adhesion of thicker Au films of approximately 24
nm thickness. An explanation can be that the thicker gold oxide layer
formed (14.4 ± 0.09 Å measured by ellipsometry) in this
case still leads to a significant charge polarization at the Au–SiO2 interface despite the thicker Au film.

Finally, we
believe that the enhanced adhesion observed for Pt
can also be explained by the proposed mechanism. Charge polarization
at the interface of Pt–oxide support has been reported elsewhere.32,33

Conclusion
In summary, we report an enabling technique
to significantly enhance
the direct adhesion of gold to oxidized silicon, solely by a UV-ozone
treatment of the deposited Au films or structures. The observed enhancement
of the adhesion can be explained as polarization-induced increased
Au–SiO2 interaction at their interface due to the
formation of gold oxide on the Au/air interface upon UV-ozone treatment.
By embedding the gold oxide layer in between two sputtered Au layers,
the adhesion increase becomes durable and independent of the influence
of the surrounding environment, i.e., gases or solutions. This enables the fabrication of SiO2-supported Au micro/nanostructures, which strongly adhered to the
substrate after storing for more than 5 months in environmental air
or sonication in ethanol for 2 h. With its simple operation, our fabrication
technique provides opportunities for patterning of various Au micro/nanostructures
at different thicknesses supported directly on SiO2 substrates,
without the need of additional adhesion layers. The absence of such
adhesion layers is highly favored for biosensing and nanophotonic
applications. By using the UV-ozone treatment, we could fabricate
high-quality tunable Au nanogap arrays for SERS application, without
the need of metallic adhesion layers.34 In addition, we believe that our proposed adhesion mechanism could
also play a role in the adhesion of plasmonic nanoparticles fabricated
by means of rapid focused ion beam milling reported by Chen etal.35 Finally,
the successful patterning of Au nanostructures on SiN-coated Si substrates,
sapphire glass substrates, MEMpax glass substrates, and ITO-coated
MEMpax glass substrates indicates that the postdeposition UV-ozone
treatment might also provide good adhesion of the Au to these substrate
materials. However, further characterization of the adhesion strength
and the influence of the surface roughness on the adhesion of Au to
these substrates is necessary.

Methods
Patterning
Au Microdots Using a Shadow Mask
A shadow
mask containing arrays of microholes with diameters ranging from 200
to 600 μm was bought from Multi Leiterplatten GmbH, Germany.
Using this shadow mask, arrays of Au microdots were patterned directly
on oxidized (∼1.1 μm thick SiO2) 4 in. Si
wafers (525 μm thick, Okmetic, Finland), using an ion-beam sputtering
system (home-built T’COathy system, MESA+, NanoLab Cleanroom,
The Netherlands) (Figure 1a).36 It is worth noting that there
was no treatment of the oxidized Si wafers prior to the shadow-masked
deposition. The sputtering processes were conducted at 200 W and a
pressure of 6.6 × 10–3 mbar adjusted by an
argon flow. The thickness of the deposited Au layers was varied by
changing the deposition time. These Au microdot arrays were used to
quantify the strength of the adhesion enhancement using the tape test.

Adhesion Measurement Using Tape Test
There are several
existing techniques for measuring the adhesion of thin films such
as the tape test, pull test, topple test, and scratch test.15 Among them, the tape test is the simplest technique.
A piece of adhesive tape is pressed onto the film surface, and the
film is considered to have passed the test, i.e. good adhesion, if it remains on the support surface after
peeling off the tape. It is worth mentioning that the classical Scotch
tape test37 was inapplicable for our fabricated
Au microdots due to their thin thickness. Therefore, a modified method
of this Scotch tape test, herein named the tape test, was used by
sputtering a second continuous Au layer ∼24 nm thick over the
wafer surface with the patterned Au microdots before applying the
tape (Figure 1b,c).
In this work, a commercial adhesive tape (3M Scotch Magic tape, USA)
of 19.1 mm in width was used to test the adhesion of periodic Au microdots
patterned on SiO2 substrates. A piece of tape was applied
to the surface of the sputtered second Au layer containing the Au
microdots and subsequently peeled off perpendicularly to the surface.
All images of the Au microdots before and after the tape test were
captured by using a bright field microscope and converted into grayscale
images—Au microdot areas are converted into black pixels—in
order to be analyzed by using ImageJ software. The strength of the
adhesion was quantified by comparing the remaining black pixels after
the test to the number before.

Patterning Gold Micro/Nanostructures
on Oxidized Silicon Substrates
Periodic microlines/holes
made of a positive photoresist (OiR 907-17i,
Fujifilm, Japan) were patterned on SiO2 substrates by using
a conventional lithography process with a mask alignment system (EVG620,
EV Group, Austria). However, for patterning periodic PR nanolines/holes,
UV-based displacement Talbot lithography (DTL, PhableR 100C, Eulitha,
Switzerland) was utilized.38 Details of
the fabrication process are shown in Figure 3. A photoresist layer of 200 ± 1.5 nm
(PFI88 photoresist diluted 1:1 with propylene glycol methyl ether
acetate, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan) was patterned using the
DTL technique with a photomask purchased from Eulitha. The patterned
PR nanostructures were subsequently transferred at a 1:1 ratio into
a bottom antireflection layer coating (BARC) layer of 187 ± 2
nm (AZ BARLi II 200) by using nitrogen (N2) plasma etching.
The plasma etching of BARC was conducted in a reactive ion etch system
(home-built TEtske system, MESA+, NanoLab Cleanroom, The Netherlands)
at wafer-level, 13 mTorr, and 25 W for 8 min.

These PR micro/nanostructures
were then used as templates for patterning Au micro/nanostructures
using a lift-off process. To improve the duration of the adhesion
strength of the patterned Au micro/nanostructures, a combination of
a two-step sputtering process of Au with an intermediate UV-ozone
treatment was used. A Au layer of approximately 13 nm was sputtered
over the PR structures, treated with UV-ozone for 5 min. Subsequently
a second Au layer (∼24 nm thick) was sputtered on top of the
UV-ozone-treated Au layer, followed by lift-off in a 99% HNO3 solution.

Characterization
The thickness of
the deposited Au
layers and formed gold oxide films was measured by ellipsometry (M-2000UI,
J.A. Woollam Co., United States) at an angle of 75°. The surface
roughness of the deposited Au layers was measured by atomic-force
microscopy (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker Corp., USA) with a contact
mode in air. HR-SEM images were captured with a high-resolution scanning
electron microscope (FEI Sirion, USA) at a 5 kV acceleration voltage
and a spot size of 3. The contact angles of a DI water drop on Au
surfaces were measured by using an interfacial tension meter (OCA
15 Pro, Dataphysics Instruments GmbH, Germany) at ambient temperature.
TEM specimens were prepared by using a focused ion beam (FIB) system
(FEI Nova 600 NanoLab FIB, USA). The TEM analysis was performed with
a Philips CM300ST-FEG TEM system (The Netherlands) at a 300 kV acceleration
voltage.
