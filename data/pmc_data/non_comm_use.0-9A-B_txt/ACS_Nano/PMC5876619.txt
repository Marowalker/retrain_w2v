Up
to 99% of systemically administered nanoparticles are cleared
through the liver. Within the liver, most nanoparticles are thought
to be sequestered by macrophages (Kupffer cells), although significant
nanoparticle interactions with other hepatic cells have also been
observed. To achieve effective cell-specific targeting of drugs through
nanoparticle encapsulation, improved mechanistic understanding of
nanoparticle–liver interactions is required. Here, we show
the caudal vein of the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) can be used as a model for assessing nanoparticle interactions
with mammalian liver sinusoidal (or scavenger) endothelial cells (SECs)
and macrophages. We observe that anionic nanoparticles are primarily
taken up by SECs and identify an essential requirement for the scavenger
receptor, stabilin-2 (stab2) in
this process. Importantly, nanoparticle–SEC interactions can
be blocked by dextran sulfate, a competitive inhibitor of stab2 and other scavenger receptors. Finally, we exploit
nanoparticle–SEC interactions to demonstrate targeted intracellular
drug delivery resulting in the selective deletion of a single blood
vessel in the zebrafish embryo. Together, we propose stab2 inhibition or targeting as a general approach for modifying nanoparticle–liver
interactions of a wide range of nanomedicines.

Cell-type
specific targeting
is a common goal in nanoparticle drug delivery. However, the inability
to efficiently target subpopulations of cells, beyond the macrophages
and monocytes of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), has stymied
progress of these technologies into clinical use.1−4 Up to 99% of systemically administered
nanoparticles, of all shapes, sizes, and chemical compositions are
cleared through the liver.5 While it is
generally accepted that nanoparticles are taken up by liver-resident
macrophages (Kupffer cells (KCs)),6 the
principal cell type of the MPS in the liver, significant nanoparticle
interactions with other hepatic cells, including liver sinusoidal
endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatocytes, and hepatic B-cells, have
also been observed.7−10 In these instances however, the cell-specific mechanisms underpinning
these interactions have not been elucidated. A detailed understanding
of exactly where and how nanoparticles are sequestered and cleared
within the liver is crucial for the effective optimization of nanoparticle-mediated
drug delivery.

The principle function of the liver is to maintain
homeostasis.
This includes the removal (“scavenging”) of macromolecular
and colloidal waste and pathogens from the blood. Within the liver,
scavenging function is primarily associated with the hepatic sinusoids,11 specialized blood vessels connecting the hepatic
artery and portal vein (incoming blood flow) with the central vein
(outgoing blood flow). In these vessels, scavenging function is facilitated
by a >10-fold decrease in blood flow velocity.12 Hepatic sinusoids are primarily composed of LSECs (∼70%)
and KCs (∼20%).13 Together these
cells comprise the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES), a term
originally proposed in the early 20th century by Aschoff14 to include specialized cells that accumulated
vital stains. Since then, the term RES has been largely superseded
by the MPS, which in the liver sinusoid includes KCs but not LSECs.

Cells with a scavenging function similar to mammalian LSECs have
been identified in all vertebrates examined. However, in teleost fish,
sharks, and lampreys these cells have not been found in the liver,
but are identified in various other organs.15 Collectively, these cells are known as scavenger endothelial cells
(SECs), a specialized endothelial cell type functionally defined as
the major clearance site of endogenous macromolecules such as oxidized
low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) from the
blood.11 Mammalian LSECs have also been
implicated in clearance of blood-borne viruses from circulation16−18 and are important cell-types of both the innate and adaptive immune
system.19,20 In LSECs, clearance function is mediated
through a relatively small number of pattern-recognition endocytosis
receptors.11 Given the wide variety of
macromolecules, colloids, and pathogens sequestered by LSECs, these
receptors are clearly promiscuous with respect to potential binding
partners. However, what general physicochemical properties direct
materials to LSECs, to what extent are individual endocytosis receptors
involved, and the significance of these interactions in the clearance
of nanoparticles from circulation are not clearly defined.

Here,
we show a specific part of the zebrafish embryonic vasculature
displays functional homology to the mammalian liver sinusoid and includes
macrophages/monocytes and functional SECs. Using this model, we are
able to study which general properties of nanoparticles result in
their uptake by each of these cell types after intravenous injection.
For SECs, we reveal an important molecular mechanism required for
nanoparticle clearance, involving the transmembrane receptor stabilin-2, which can be both inhibited and exploited to
guide cell-specific nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery.

Results and Discussion
A Zebrafish
Model for Liposome Biodistribution
Of the
myriad nanoparticles reported as potential drug delivery vectors,
liposomes are the most widely investigated and the major class of
nanoparticles approved for clinical use.21,22 So far, the ability to predict the fate of liposomes following intravenous
injection based on lipid composition alone has been limited. Furthermore,
the opacity of mammalian models precludes comprehensive assessment
of the dynamic behavior of liposomes in vivo. Recent
studies have shown that the small and transparent zebrafish embryo
allows for the direct observation of circulating nanoparticles, including
liposomes, and their interactions with cells.23−26 These studies show key aspects
of nanoparticle behavior, including uptake by the MPS, are conserved
between zebrafish and mammals. We therefore selected this model to
identify the influence of lipid composition on liposome biodistribution
and the mechanisms of liposome uptake by cells.

Three liposome
formulations, either approved for clinical use or under development
(Myocet, EndoTAG-1, and AmBisome),27−29 were initially selected
for intravenous injection into zebrafish embryos. These formulations
were specifically chosen to assess the influence of contrasting nanoparticle
surface charge. Myocet is a neutral liposomal-doxorubicin formulation
showing extravasation in tumors.27 EndoTAG-1
is a positively charged liposomal-paclitaxel formulation targeting
actively growing tumor blood vessels.28 AmBisome is a negatively charged liposomal-amphotericin B formulation
used to treat severe fungal infections.29 Fluorescently labeled liposomes (∼100 nm in diameter and
without encapsulated drugs) based on the lipid composition of these
formulations (Table S1) were injected intravenously
into the duct of Cuvier of zebrafish embryos at 54 h post-fertilization
(hpf), a stage at which most organ systems are established. Injected
embryos were imaged using confocal microscopy at 1, 8, 24, and 48
h post-injection (hpi) (Figure 1a), and confocal micrographs were generated for the entire
embryo (whole organism level) as well as from a region caudal to the
cloaca (tissue level) (Figure 1b,d and Figure S1). We developed
a quantification method to compare levels of circulating liposomes,
extravasation, and accumulation in different blood vessel types between
formulations (Figure 1c,e–h and Figure S2).

(i) Whole-embryo view of liposome distribution in kdrl:GFP transgenic embryos, 1 h after injection with DOPG and DSPC liposomes.
Liposome accumulation for both formulations is observed in the primitive
head sinus (PHS), common cardinal vein (CCV), posterior cardinal vein
(PCV), and caudal vein (CV). (j) Tissue level view of liposome distribution
in kdrl:GFP transgenic embryos, 1 h after injection
with DOPG and DSPC liposomes at 102 hpf. Liposome accumulation is
observed in the entire caudal vein (CV), but only on the dorsal side
of the PCV (dPCV, arrows).

At 1 hpi, on a whole organism level, all three liposome formulations
were found associated with the blood vasculature and over time, the
fluorescence associated with freely circulating liposomes within the
lumen of the dorsal aorta, decayed exponentially (Figure 1b,e). At the tissue level however,
clear differences in liposome biodistribution were observed (Figure 1d). Consistent with
their behavior in mammals, neutral Myocet liposomes were mostly seen
circulating within the blood vessel lumen. At 1 hpi, liposome translocation
through the vessel wall (extravasation) was already evident, and between
1 and 8 hpi, co-localization with plasma-exposed macrophages was observed
(Figure 1d,g, Figure S3). Increasing the size of Myocet liposomes
resulted in enhanced uptake by macrophages, whereas surface PEGylation—a
strategy widely employed to limit nanoparticle clearance in
vivo(30)—effectively inhibited
phagocytotic uptake as described previously (Figure S3).23,26

For EndoTAG-1 and AmBisome,
a large fraction of the injected dose
was removed from circulation by 1 hpi and 8 hpi respectively, and
these formulations were found associated with the vessel wall (Figure 1e,h). Strikingly
however, anionic AmBisome liposomes associated only with ECs of a
subset of blood vessels, namely the caudal vein (CV), the posterior
and common cardinal veins (PCV and CCV), and the primary head sinus
(PHS) as well as ECs within the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT-ECs)
(Figure 1d,f–h).31 These comprise the majority of venous ECs within
the zebrafish embryo at this developmental stage.32 Cationic EndoTAG-1 liposomes at 1 hpi associated with all
ECs as expected33 but at later time points
remain associated only with venous ECs.

AmBisome, EndoTAG-1,
and Myocet are each composed of various mixtures
of (phospho)lipids and cholesterol. In these cases, lipid headgroup
chemistries, fatty acid chain saturation and cholesterol content,
will together combine to affect the overall physicochemical character
of the formulated liposomes and consequently their in vivo fate. To limit potential variation in liposome membrane composition,
we next formulated and injected ∼100 nm liposomes composed
of the individual (phospho)lipids constituting AmBisome, EndoTAG-1,
and Myocet (Figure S4 and Table S1). We
also included liposomes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPG)
and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC).
In these experiments, injected cationic liposomes (measured zeta potential;
>30 mV) initially associated with both arterial and venous ECs
of
the embryonic fish. All anionic liposomes (<−30 mV) associated
with venous ECs alone, and the behavior of neutral liposomes was dependent
on lipid fatty acid chain saturation, whereby “fluid”
liposome membranes (for example, DOPC), rich in unsaturated lipids,
are freely circulating, whereas those composed of ‘rigid’,
saturated lipids (for example, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC)) associated with venous ECs. Of these, liposomes composed of
DSPC and DOPG associated with venous ECs of the CCV, PHS, PCV, CHT,
and CV most strongly (Figure 1i, Figure S4a,d). Both these liposomes
also accumulated in macrophages within the CHT and along the CCV (Figure S5).

Differential distribution of
nanoparticles over blood vessel networks
has previously been attributed to differences in flow patterns.7,25 However, when injections were performed in 4 day-old zebrafish embryos,
both DOPG and DSPC liposomes preferentially associated with only a
subset of venous ECs along the dorsal side of the PCV (dPCV) (Figure 1j). Liposome association
with a subset of ECs in a single, straight blood vessel (where flow
patterns are expected to be similar throughout) indicated dPCV ECs
are a cell type distinct from ventral PCV (vPCV) ECs. Indeed, differentiation
of dPCV and vPCV ECs has previously been observed during the induction
of lymphatic differentiation and subintestinal vein angiogenesis,34,35 suggesting dPCV differentiation may lead to the expression of specific
receptors by these ECs which in turn could mediate the selective binding
of DOPG and DSPC liposomes.

Identification of a Zebrafish EC Type Homologous
to Mammalian
LSECs
Selective association of liposomes with most venous
ECs has not been observed in adult mammals. However, we hypothesized
a more restricted subset of ECs in mammals could be functionally related
to venous ECs of the embryonic zebrafish. To test this hypothesis,
DOPG liposomes were injected intravenously into Tie2:GFP+ adult mice.
In these mice, liposomes were removed from circulation within 1 hpi,
and a striking accumulation was observed in the liver (Figure 2a). Within the liver, liposomes
associated with Tie2:GFP+ sinusoidal ECs and with cells identified
as KCs based on cell shape and intravascular localization (Figure 2b). No liposome accumulation
was observed in hepatocytes or other analyzed organs. This suggested
venous ECs and macrophages within the CHT and CV of the embryonic
zebrafish were functionally homologous to LSECs and KCs of the mammalian
liver and comprise the RES in zebrafish embryos. To confirm this,
we injected colloidal lithium carmine (Li-Car), the most prominent
vital stain originally used to define the mammalian RES, into zebrafish
embryos. Making use of the inherent fluorescence of carminic acid,36 we observed accumulation of this colloid in
the same blood vessels (CV, CHT, PCV, and PHS) and subcellular structures
within venous ECs and macrophages, in which DOPG and DSPC liposomes
also accumulate (Figure 2c).

well as sinusoid-associated cells which based on shape and position

of fluoHA is observed in the PHS, CCV, PCV, and CV. (f) Tissue level

embryos, 1 h after injection at 102 hpf. FluoHA accumulation is observed
in the entire caudal vein (CV), but only on the dorsal side of the
PCV (dPCV, arrows). (g) Tissue level view of fluoHA in kdrl:RFP and mpeg:RFP transgenic embryos. Co-localization
of RFP expression and fluoHA is observed only within kdrl:RFP endothelial cells, but not mpeg:RFP monocytes/macrophages.
(h) Tissue level view of co-injected fluoHA and DOPG liposomes, 1
h after injection reveals co-localization in SECs. Monocytes/macrophages
(arrowheads) take up DOPG but not fluoHA. (i) Ex vivo imaging of adult mouse liver, 1 h after injection with fluoHA and
DOPG liposomes reveals widespread co-localization within sinusoidal
ECs (arrows). KCs (arrowheads) take up DOPG liposomes only.

A small number of transmembrane
receptors are selectively expressed
in mammalian LSECs compared to other blood vascular ECs.11 These include the scavenger receptors Stabilin-1
and -237 and the mannose receptor Mrc1.
Analysis of the expression patterns of their orthologs (stab1,
stab2 and mrc1a) in zebrafish embryos confirmed
their restricted expression in venous ECs of the PHS, PCV, CHT, and
CV as described previously.38,39 Importantly, expression
of these genes becomes enriched in the dPCV, matching observed EC
binding specificities of both DOPG and DSPC liposomes (Figure S6).

LSECs mediate the scavenging
of macromolecular waste including
oxLDL and HA through receptor-mediated endocytosis.40 Therefore, we injected fluorescently labeled oxLDL and
HA (fluoHA) and observed their rapid endocytosis, within the same
subset of venous ECs (within the PHS, CCV, (d)PCV, and CV) (Figure 2d–f). Based
on the conserved uptake of DOPG liposome, oxLDL, fluoHA, and Li-Car
from circulation and expression of known LSEC markers by this venous
EC subset in zebrafish embryos, we define them as SECs - homologous
to mammalian LSECs.

In contrast to DSPC and DOPG liposomes and
to oxLDL, fluoHA uptake
was specific to SECs, and no uptake was observed in macrophages (Figure 2g). We next used
fluoHA as a marker for endocytosis in SECs. Co-injection of fluoHA
with DSPC or DOPG liposomes resulted in precise intracellular co-localization
in all SECs of the embryonic fish, while in macrophages only liposome
internalization was observed (Figure 2h, Figure S7). Intracellular
co-localization in LSECs (but not KCs) of fluoHA and DOPG liposomes
was conserved in the adult mouse liver (Figure 2i). These results demonstrated fluoHA endocytosis
is a selective vital marker for SECs in vertebrates and offered a
convenient method to study SEC differentiation in the developing zebrafish
embryo (Figure S8). Importantly, we found
SECs were present at the earliest time point at which intravenous
injection is possible (28 hpf). During embryonic and larval stages,
SECs were maintained within the CV, but starting at 52 hpf became
gradually restricted to the dPCV. No fluoHA uptake was observed in
embryonic veins that develop during later stages, such as in the brain
and subintestinal vasculature. These results show that SECs are one
of the first EC subtypes to emerge during embryonic development and
provide the first analysis of early embryonic SEC differentiation
in any vertebrate.

Stabilin-2 Is Required for Uptake of Liposomes
and Other Nanoparticles
by SECs
The precise intracellular co-localization of fluoHA
with DOPG and DSPC liposomes in SECs indicated the use of a shared
receptor for endocytosis. Importantly, one of the markers for SECs
in zebrafish embryos and adult mammals, Stabilin-2, has been identified
as the main HA clearance receptor in the mouse liver.40In vitro, Stabilin-2 and its paralog Stabilin-1 have been shown to bind to a large variety of endogenous
(mostly anionic) macromolecules41 as well
as phosphothiorate-modified antisense oligonucleotides (PS-ASO),42 apoptotic cell bodies,43 biotinylated albumin,44 and carbon nanotubes.45In vivo, Stabilin-1 and Stabilin-2
were shown to mediate sequestration (but not uptake) by LSECs of aged
erythrocytes in a phosphatidylserine-dependent manner.46 Stabilin-1 and Stabilin-2 are both nonessential
genes for development and normal physiology in mice, with mice lacking
both Stabilin-1 and Stabilin-2 displaying deficient removal of nephrotoxic
macromolecules from circulation.37 To test
if stabilins were involved in liposome uptake by SECs, embryos were
first pretreated with dextran sulfate - a competitive inhibitor of
scavenger receptors, including stab1 and stab2.47,48 Subsequent liposome injection
(or co-injection) resulted in a striking loss of liposome uptake by
SECs, offset by an increase in circulating liposomes, and particularly
in the case of DOPG liposomes, an increase in macrophage uptake (Figure 3a,b). In contrast,
injection of mannan, a competitive inhibitor of mrc1a,49 did not inhibit liposome uptake by
SECs (data not shown).

based on Mann–Whitney test. n = 6–10
per group (in two experiments).

To identify the specific role of stab1 and stab2 in liposome uptake, mutants for both genes were generated
through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. Here, we report the analysis
of a stab2 mutant line, in which we identified a
4nt deletion (stab2ibl2), leading to a frameshift in the stab2 coding sequence
and a premature stop codon (C233X) (Figure 3c, Figure S9).
This mutation is predicted to remove most conserved stab2 domains including all fasiclin domains, the HA binding Link domain,
and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments. Homozygous stab2ibl2 mutants displayed
a strong reduction of stab2, but not of stab1 or mrc1a, mRNA expression indicating normal SEC
differentiation and nonsense-mediated decay of stab2ibl2 mRNA (Figure S10). Stab2ibl2 mutants survived throughout embryonic development without defects
in either blood or lymphatic vascular systems, which were described
previously for stab2 morphants,50,51 and fertile adults were identified in normal Mendelian ratios (Figure 3d,e). Consistent
with the increase in circulating HA levels observed in mouse Stab2
knockouts,52 a complete loss of fluoHA
uptake by SECs was observed in zebrafish stab2ibl2 mutants, showing a conserved role for stab2 in HA clearance in vertebrates (Figure 3f). Importantly, when either DOPG or DSPC
liposomes were injected in stab2ibl2 mutants, a strong reduction of liposome endocytosis by SECs
was observed, offset by an increase in circulating liposome levels
and an increase in macrophage uptake (Figure 3g,h). Differential liposome uptake in neighboring
venous ECs of embryos with a mosaic loss of stab2 function indicated a cell-autonomous role of stab2 function in liposome uptake by SECs (Figure S11). For the original three liposome formulations screened,
loss of stab2 function affected AmBisome, but not
Myocet or EndoTAG-1 biodistribution (Figure 3i–k). Since both AmBisome and EndoTAG-1
accumulated within SECs of wild-type embryos, stab2-mediated uptake by SECs appears dependent on specific physicochemical
properties of liposomes and stab2 does not function
in the clearance of cationic liposomes.

In vivo, several other scavenger receptors with
similar binding profiles to stab2 are expressed,11 not only on SECs but also on other endothelial
cells and macrophages. Given the significant increase in circulating
DOPG, DSPC, and AmBisome liposomes in stab2ibl2 mutants, stab2 clearly plays
a dominant role in removal of these liposomes from circulation compared
to other scavenger receptors (including the structurally related stab1). Similarly, clearance of PS-ASOs was recently shown
to be dominated by Stab2 in the mouse liver.42 To test the generality of stab2 function, several
other polyanionic nanoparticles were injected in wild-type and stab2ibl2 mutant embryos as
well as following dextran sulfate injection (Figure 4a–l). These included endogenous (DOPS
liposomes, a model for apoptotic cell fragments), viral (Cowpea Chlorotic
Mottle Virus-like particles, CCMV VLPs),53 polymeric (polymersomes54 and polystyrene
beads), and inorganic (quantum dots, QDs) nanoparticles. All of these
particles were endocytosed selectively by SECs in zebrafish embryos,
and in all cases SEC endocytosis could be inhibited by dextran sulfate.
However, not all nanoparticles were dependent on stab2 for SEC endocytosis. Although uptake by SECs of DOPS liposomes,
polymersomes, and polystyrene nanoparticles was strongly decreased
in stab2ibl2 mutants,
uptake of CCMV VLPs was only partly dependent on stab2 and QD uptake appeared stab2-independent. Alternatively,
QD uptake by SECs is also mediated in part by stab2, but its function is masked in stab2ibl2 mutants through redundancy with other scavenger
receptors (such as stab1) that can be inhibited by
dextran sulfate. CCMV VLPs (28 nm) and QDs (<10 nm) were the smallest
nanoparticles screened in this study, suggesting size may be an important
determinant of scavenger receptor–nanoparticle interactions.

Targeted Liposomal Drug Delivery to SECs
Finally, to
demonstrate we could extend the observed interaction of nanoparticles
with SECs to cell-selective drug delivery, we encapsulated a model
drug, clodronic acid, within DSPC liposomes (Table S2). Clodronic acid requires active transport (endocytosis
or phagocytosis) across the target cell membrane to illicit a cytotoxic
effect.55 Liposome-mediated intracellular
delivery of clodronic acid into monocytes/macrophages is used extensively
as a research tool to selectively remove these cell populations in vivo.56 After 12–24
hpi, synchronous changes in the morphology of the CHT and caudal vein
ECs were observed, followed by a gradual loss of kdrl:GFP+ endothelial cells or cell fragments
and ultimately leading to the complete disappearance of the caudal
vein between 24 and 48 hpi (Figure 5a–d, Movie S1 and S2). The PCV and other cell types within the
CHT, including mpeg:GFP+ macrophages (most of which
are not exposed to circulating nanoparticles) as well as mpx:GFP+ neutrophils, were largely unaffected (Figure S12). Injection of free clodronic acid (a control demonstrating
the requirement of liposomal encapsulation) did not result in any
observable changes to the venous endothelium. Similarly, injection
of freely circulating DOPC-clodronic acid liposomes (a control demonstrating
the requirement of selective nanoparticle uptake by SECs) did not
affect the venous endothelium. The development of the dorsal aorta
was unaffected by deletion of the CV and CHT, and blood supply to
the caudal parts of the embryo was maintained through a rerouting
of blood cells into the intersegmental vessels and dorsal longitudinal
anastomotic vessel (DLAV). Embryos with a complete loss of the CV
and CHT endothelial cells were agile and could survive at least until
6 dpf. Imaging of fluorescent DSPC-clodronic acid liposomes revealed
selective stab2-dependent uptake by SECs analogous
to empty DSPC liposomes (Figure 5e). Importantly, loss of stab2 function
as observed in stab2ibl2 mutant embryos rescued the CV phenotype induced by injection of
DSPC-clodronic acid liposomes (Figure 5 f-h, Movie S3). These results
identify stab2-mediated uptake of liposomes by SECs
as a simple strategy for intracellular compound delivery to this cell
type in zebrafish embryos.

Conclusion
In summary, we show stab2 is an important (scavenger)
receptor mediating the uptake of circulating nanoparticles by SECs.
In particular, anionic nanoparticles, between 50 and 250 nm in size,
are avidly taken up by SECs in a stab2-dependent
fashion. Here, binding and uptake appear independent of material and
functional properties of nanoparticles and are solely dependent on
surface charge. Given the comparable sizes and surface charge of many
blood-borne viruses,16−18,57 clearance of these
circulating pathogens by LSECs is also potentially mediated by stab2. These findings, combined with the high expression
of stab2 by LSECs within the mammalian liver,11 implicate SECs as an important cell-type in
the binding, uptake, and clearance of administered nanoparticles.
As such, we support the re-adoption of the RES, over the MPS, as the
most accurate term to describe the specialized cellular components
involved in nanoparticle clearance from circulation.58

The ultimate goal of many nanoparticle-based technologies
is cell-type-specific
targeting. Yet reported targeting efficiencies rarely surpass 1% of
the total injected nanoparticle dose.1 A
major contributing factor has been off-target nanoparticle interactions
within the mammalian liver.5 By revealing
the molecular basis of nanoparticle interactions with specific cells
of the embryonic zebrafish, we have been able to demonstrate nanoparticle
targeting of, and drug delivery to, specific cell types with homologues
in the mammalian liver. In addition, we show these interactions can
be effectively inhibited by dextran sulfate. As stab2 is not essential for normal adult physiology,37 this offers a simple method to extend circulation lifetimes
of nanoparticles by minimizing potential off-target liver interactions.59 This will likely be particularly beneficial
in instances where active targeting of nanoparticles to cell types
beyond the liver (for example, cancer cells) is desired.

Importantly,
the SEC/selective drug delivery we describe has not
resulted from adding further complexity to nanoparticle designs. Instead,
through systematic screening of “simple” nanoparticles
(i.e., liposomes composed of a single
phospholipid), we have established what general properties and molecular
mechanisms direct nanoparticles to specific cell types. The use of
the embryonic zebrafish as a model organism, and the ability to visualize
nanoparticle–cell interactions at high resolution in living
organisms, has been essential in this process. We therefore propose
that the embryonic zebrafish, with its established extensive genetic
toolkit, is a valuable preclinical in vivo model
allowing screening, optimization, and mechanistic understanding of
nanoparticle biodistribution, predictive of their behavior in mammals.26

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Fluorescein-labeled hyaluronic acid (fluoHA)
was prepared through conjugation of hyaluronic acid (100 kDa) with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (Isomer I, Sigma-Aldrich) as previously
described.60 Additional fluoHA was provided
as a kind gift from W. Jiskoot (Leiden University, The Netherlands).
Colloidal Li-Car was prepared as previously described.61 Rhodamine-loaded polymersomes on polyisobutadiene/polyethylene
glycol (PIB/PEG) block copolymers54 were
a kind gift from S. Askes and S. Bonnet (Leiden University, The Netherlands).
Atto-647 labeled CCMV-virus-like particles (t = 3,
28 nm)53 were a kind gift from M. de Ruiter
and J. Cornelissen (Twente University, The Netherlands). Purchased
reagents are described in the Supporting Information.

Liposome Preparation and Characterization
All liposomes
(without encapsulated drugs) were formulated in ddH2O at
a total lipid concentration of 1 mM. Individual lipids, as stock solutions
(1–10 mM) in chloroform, were combined at the desired molar
ratios and dried to a film, first under a stream of N2 and
then >1h under vacuum. With the exception of Myocet 325 and 464
nm,
lipid films were hydrated in 1 mL ddH2O at >65 °C
(with gentle vortexing if necessary) to form large/giant multilamellar
vesicles. Large unilamellar vesicles were formed through extrusion
above the Tm of all lipids (>65 °C,
Mini-extruder with heating block, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster,
US). Hydrated lipids were passed 11 times through 2 × 400 nm
polycarbonate (PC) membranes (Nucleopore Track-Etch membranes, Whatman),
followed by 11 times through 2 × 100 nm PC pores. All liposomes
were stored at 4 °C. With the exception of DSPC liposomes (significant
aggregation after 1 week storage), all liposomes were stable for at
least 1 month. Myocet 325 and 464 nm liposomes were formulated by
gentle hydration of lipid films at 35 °C (without vortexing).
In the case of 464 nm Myocet liposomes, hydrated lipids were passed
through a 800 nm PC membrane 7 times at 35 °C. In the case of
325 nm Myocet liposomes, hydrated lipids were passed through a 400
nm PC membrane 7 times at 35 °C. See Supporting Information for nanoparticle characterization methods and Table S1 for all lipid compositions, size, and
zeta potentials of nanoparticles used in this study.

Clodronic Acid
Encapsulation and Quantification
Lipid
films (10 mM total lipids) were hydrated with ddH2O containing
200 mgmL–1 clodronic acid (1 mL) and formulated
through extrusion as described for the corresponding “empty”
liposomes. Unencapsulated clodronic acid was removed by size exclusion
chromatography (illustra NAP Sephadex G-25 DNA grade premade columns
(GE Healthcare) used according to the supplier’s instructions).
Eluted clodronic acid-encapsulated liposomes were diluted 2.5×
during SEC and injected without further dilution. Quantification of
encapsulated clodronic acid was determined by UV absorbance as previously
reported.62 Briefly, liposomes were first
destroyed through a 1:1 dilution with 1% v/v Triton X-100 solution
before further dilution into an acidic CuSO4 solution (1:2.25:2.25;
Liposome-Triton X-100 mix: 3 mM HNO3: 4 mM CuSO4). The concentration of clodronic acid was determined by UV absorbance
(Cary 3 Bio UV–vis spectrometer) at 240 nm and quantified against
a predetermined calibration curve (50 μM to 2.5 mM clodronic
acid). All UV–vis absorbance measurements were taken at room
temperature. Blanks were made using liposome solutions without encapsulated
clodronic acid but prepared otherwise identically (including SEC procedure).
The final encapsulated clodronic acid concentration varied between
0.9 and 1.7 mg mL–1 (see Supporting Information Table S2).

Zebrafish Strains, in Situ Hybridization, and
CRISPR/Cas9 Mutagenesis
Zebrafish (Danio rerio, strain AB/TL) were maintained and handled according to the guidelines
from the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (http://zfin.org) and in compliance with the directives of the
local animal welfare committee of Leiden University. Fertilization
was performed by natural spawning at the beginning of the light period,
and eggs were raised at 28.5 °C in egg water (60 ug/mL Instant
Ocean sea salts). The following previously established zebrafish lines
were used Tg(kdrl:GFP)s843,63Tg(kdrl:RFP-CAAX)s916,38Tg(mpeg:GFP)gl22,64Tg(mpeg:RFP-CAAX)ump2,65Tg(flt1enh:RFP)hu5333,66Tg(flt4BAC:YFP)hu7135,67 and Tg(mpx:GFP)uwm1.68 Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described.69Supporting Information Table S3 lists primers for probe generation. Cloning-free sgRNAs
for CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis were designed and synthesized as described.70 sgRNAs (125 pg) and cas9 mRNA (300 pg) were
co-injected into single-cell wild-type, albino or flt4:YFP;
flt1:RFP transgenic embryos. Mutagenesis efficacy, founder
identification, and genotyping were performed using CRISPR-STAT.71 The nucleotide sequences and predicted stab2 amino acid sequences in the stab2ibl2 line are shown in Figure S11. Table S3 lists guide
RNA sequences and genotyping primers. For mosaic analysis, heterozygous
embryos (stab2ibl/+)
obtained from a cross between a stab2ibl2 homozygous parent and a kdrl:GFP (stab2+/+) parent were
co-injected with sgRNAs (125 pg) and cas9 mRNA (300 pg) to create
second-hit mutations in the wild-type allele.

Zebrafish Intravenous Injections
Liposomal formulations
were injected into 2 day old zebrafish embryos (52–56 hpf)
using a modified microangraphy protocol.72 Embryos were anesthetized in 0.01% tricaine and embedded in 0.4%
agarose containing tricaine before injection. To improve reproducibility
of microangiography experiments, 1 nL volumes were calibrated and
injected into the sinus venosus/duct of Cuvier. We created a small
injection space by penetrating the skin with the injection needle
and gently pulling the needle back, thereby creating a small pyramidal
space in which the liposomes and polymers were injected. Successfully
injected embryos were identified through the backward translocation
of venous erythrocytes and the absence of damage to the yolk ball,
which would reduce the amount of liposomes in circulation. For injections
at later stages (>80 hpf), 0.5 nL volumes were injected into the
CCV.
The following concentrations were injected: dextran sulfate (20 mg/mL),
FluoHA (0.2 mg/mL), oxLDL (1 mg/mL), CCMV-VLP (1 mg/mL), QDs (1:25
dilution), lithium carmine (1:50 dilution), polymersomes (1 mg/mL),
latex beads (1:10 dilution). Dextran sulfate was injected 20 min prior
to nanoparticle injection.

Zebrafish Imaging and Quantification
For each treatment
or time point, at least six individual embryos (biological replicates)
using at minimum two independently formulated liposome preparations
were imaged using confocal microscopy. Embryos were randomly picked
from a dish of 20–60 successfully injected embryos (exclusion
criteria were: no backward translocation of erythrocytes after injection
and/or damage to the yolk ball). Confocal z-stacks were captured on
a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope, using a 10× air objective
(HCX PL FLUOTAR) or a 40× water-immersion objective (HCX APO
L). For whole-embryo views, 3–5 overlapping z-stacks were captured
to cover the complete embryo. Laser intensity, gain, and offset settings
were identical between stacks and sessions. Images were processed
and quantified using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ.73,74 Quantification (not blinded) of liposome biodistribution was performed
on 40× confocal z-stacks (with an optical thickness of 2 μm/slice)
as described in the Supporting Information.

Mouse Injections and Imaging
All experiments were performed
in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Committee
of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, The Netherlands.
Tg(TIE2GFP)287Sato/J mice were sedated using isoflurane inhalation
anesthesia (1.5–2% isoflurane/O2 mixture). 100 μL
of DOPG liposomes (10 mM DOPG + 1% Rhod-PE) diluted 1:5 in PBS were
injected retro-orbitally with an insulin syringe (BD). After 1 h,
mice were sacrificed, and organs were harvested and imaged ex vivo on glass bottom dishes. Images were taken with a
Leica SP8 multiphoton microscope with a chameleon Vision-S (Coherent
Inc.), equipped with four HyD detectors: HyD1 (<455 nm), HyD2 (455–490
nm), HyD3 (500–550 nm), and HyD4 (560–650 nm). Different
wavelengths between 700 nm and 1150 nm were used for excitation; HA
and Rhod-PE were excited with a wavelength of 960/1050 nm and detected
in HyD3 and HyD4. All images were in 12 bit and acquired with a 25×
(HCX IRAPO N.A. 0.95 WD 2.5 mm) water objective.

Statistical
Analysis and Data Availability
Because
of small sample sizes, nonparametric tests were used exclusively.
For comparisons between two groups, two-tailed Mann–Whitney
tests were performed. For comparisons between multiple groups, we
used Kruskal–Wallis tests followed by two-tailed Dunn’s
tests with Bonferroni correction using the PMCMR package in R.75 No statistical methods were used to predetermine
sample size, but group sizes were >5 in order for the null distribution
of the Kruskal–Wallis statistic to approximate the X2 distribution (with k–1 degrees of freedom).
With the exception of Figure 1e, graphs show all individual data points and the median.
Confocal image stacks (raw data) are available from the corresponding
authors upon reasonable request.
