Enzymes play a crucial role in many
biological processes which
require harnessing and converting free chemical energy into kinetic
forces in order to accomplish tasks. Enzymes are considered to be
molecular machines, not only because of their capability of energy
conversion in biological systems but also because enzymatic catalysis
can result in enhanced diffusion of enzymes at a molecular level.
Enlightened by nature’s design of biological machinery, researchers
have investigated various types of synthetic micro/nanomachines by
using enzymatic reactions to achieve self-propulsion of micro/nanoarchitectures.
Yet, the mechanism of motion is still under debate in current literature.
Versatile proof-of-concept applications of these enzyme-powered micro/nanodevices
have been recently demonstrated. In this review, we focus on discussing
enzymes not only as stochastic swimmers but also as nanoengines to
power self-propelled synthetic motors. We present an overview on different
enzyme-powered micro/nanomachines, the current debate on their motion
mechanism, methods to provide motion and speed control, and an outlook
of the future potentials of this multidisciplinary field.

==== Body
The harnessing of chemically
free energy for conversion into mechanical work is ubiquitous in nature
and crucial for survival of organisms from all levels of complexity.
Tasks such as phagocytosis, vesicle transportation within the cells,
locomotion, and cell division are based on mechanical work achieved
through surrounding substrate decomposition.1 In biological systems, enzymes are workhorse proteins that act as
catalysts, being able to turnover substrates with high specificity
and efficiency that power biological machinery. Examples include synthesis
of DNA molecules by DNA polymerase, hydrolysis of proteins by endopeptidase,
and using energy by ATP hydrolysis.2 Effectively,
enzymes are themselves considered to be nanomachines because fundamental
studies on enzymes revealed that catalytic activity enhances diffusion
at the single-molecule level.3−5

Synthetic micro/nanomachines
arose from endeavors to mimic biological
counterparts abundant in nature, in order to understand its fundamentals
and to develop functional and well-controlled tools with applications
in a wide range of fields.6 Synthetic machines
controllable at such a tiny scale may power devices for applications
in environmental sciences,7 biomedicine,8 or diagnostics9 to
name a few.

In this review, we focus on enzymes as molecular
machines, as well
as their driving force when combined with synthetic micro/nanomachines.
These synthetic molecular machines can be based in a myriad of structures.10 One example is nucleic-acid-based motors, where
enzymatic activity controls the hybridization and hydrolysis of DNA
and/or RNA strands, promoting motion of structures based in nucleic
acids.11−13 Recently, enzymatic catalysis was also reported to
power the motion of various structures at the micro/nanoscale, such
as polymeric14 and inorganic particles.15,16 By coupling enzymes onto the surfaces of these structures, enzymatic
turnover of substrates provides necessary energy to overcome random
Brownian motion and achieve active motion. Moreover, by functionalizing
fixed surfaces with enzymes, the driving force produced by enzymatic
catalysis is transferred to the surrounding environment, giving rise
to fluid flow (Scheme 1).17

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of Enzyme-Powered
Micro/Nanomachines
Researchers have carried out in-depth studies on enzymes
as swimmers
and as engines for active synthetic matter. In order to use biocatalytic
energy, investigation on the fundamental mechanism of enzymatic reactions
has been performed, aiming at understanding the conversion of enzyme
catalysis into propulsion power, including on the mechanism of single
enzymes as active motors (Scheme 1).3,5,18,19

Although this field is still in its
infancy, it can have an impact
in fields such as smart drug delivery, bio-nanotechnology for medical
purposes, environmental remediation, among others. Therefore, it is
important to investigate enzymes, not only understanding the basic
knowledge of the biocatalytic process but also carrying out in-depth
studies on enzymes as swimmers. Furthermore, it is crucial to unravel
the mechanism underlying the motion/swimming when enzymes are conjugated
onto more complex structures. Deeper insights on enzymatic propulsion
may affect the development of advanced and more versatile types of
synthetic micro/nanomachines. Herein, we review the study of enzymes
as molecular machines and used as engines to power motion of other
structures. We expect that comprehensive studies on this type of propulsion
at the micro/nanoscale will help to develop micro/nanomachines, providing
insights for future development of this field.

Enzymes as Motors
Enzymes are proteins capable of efficiently
catalyzing the conversion of a substrate into products,20−23 including most forms of biological motion at the cellular level.24 In this sense, myosins, which move along actin
filaments,25,26 and kinesins and dyneins, which
move along microtubule tracks,27 are the
three main types of molecular motors within the cells. These molecular
motors generate energy to move from the hydrolysis of ATP (ATP + H2O → ADP + inorganic phosphate (Pi)) by enzymes, e.g., ATPase,26,28 with forces that vary
between 1 and 10 pN.24,29,30

Other types of intracellular motion can be achieved through
single enzymes, as in ATPase rotation. These proteins are motor complexes
anchored to organelle membranes and are involved in either the synthesis
of ATP coupled to the electrochemical proton gradient formed by electron
transfer chains (F-ATPase)31 (Figure 1A) or the acidification
of intra- or extracellular compartments (V-ATPase).32,33 Although the rotary mechanism of ATPases was hypothesized by Boyer
in 1979,34 it was empirically observed
by Noji and collaborators35,36 for the first time
in 1997, through the conjugation of a fluorescent actin filament to
the immobilized enzyme (Figure 1B).36 The rotation movement of
ATPases is triggered by changes in the conformation of the different
subunits (Figure 1C)
following substrate binding or release.37−40 Moreover, in 2002, Montemagno
and co-workers41 discovered that ATPases
are capable of generating forces and also move nickel rotors.

Apart from these well-known intracellular motion mechanisms,
the
self-diffusion of cytoplasm-located enzymes has been hypothesized
to play a vital role for transduction of intracellular signals.42 However, there was no empirical demonstration
of these nontraditional enzymatic motions until very recently. In
this respect, Muddana and co-workers reported in 2010 a catalysis-enhanced
diffusion of urease enzyme,3 which was
shown to be highly reliant upon substrate concentration (Figure 1D). The same authors
further confirmed these results using both urease and catalase enzymes,
where they observed that the diffusion of free urease and catalase
enzymes was not only significantly enhanced by the turnover of their
substrates [(NH2)2CO + H2O →
CO2 + 2NH3, H2O2 →
H2O + 1/2O2, respectively] but also displayed
preferential movement toward increasing substrate concentrations,
which should be regarded as a different form of molecular chemotaxis.4

These findings have led to the harnessing
of chemical energy released
by enzymes as a source of power for micro- and nanomotors. Yet, the
exact mechanism that underlies enzymatic motion in fluids is not completely
understood. Golestanian suggested that the enhanced diffusion of enzymes
could be explained by a self-diffusiophoresis mechanism triggered
by the asymmetric release of products involved in the catalytic reaction,
creating interfacial forces depending on osmotic gradients, charges,
or other properties.18,43 This theory has been further
confirmed by Colberg et al.,19 who reported that self-propulsion forces of ångström-sized
molecules are generated by different interactions of the enzyme with
the local gradient of products released. On the other hand, the enhanced
diffusion of single enzymes could also be attributed to the conformational
changes that play a critical role in catalysis. This phenomenon could
result in stochastical swimming.18,44−48 Recently, Pelz and co-workers49 performed
a direct measurement of the energetic drive of substrate-dependent
lid closing in the enzyme adenylate kinase (ATP + AMP → 2ADP)
by using a single-molecule force spectroscopy approach based on optical
tweezers (Figure 1E).

The increase of temperature during catalysis is involved in single-enzyme-enhanced
diffusion. In this sense, Riedel et al.(5) recently reported that the enhanced diffusion
of enzymes is related to the heat released during substrate turnover.
Based on their observations through fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
analyzed within the framework of stochastic theory, these researchers
proposed a motion mechanism based on the generation of an asymmetric
pressure wave by the transient displacement of the center-of-mass
of the enzyme (chemoacoustic effect, Figure 1F). However, this is a topic of current debate.
In this regard, Golestanian has examined the role of four different
mechanisms (i.e., self-thermophoresis, boost in kinetic
energy, stochastic swimming, and collective heating) in the temperature-driven
enhanced diffusion of enzymes observed by Riedel et al. In this work, it is concluded that there is not enough evidence
to assume that either self-thermophoresis or a boost in kinetic energy
is responsible for the experimentally obtained values of effective
diffusion. As an alternative, he also proposes that the enhanced diffusion
of enzymes that catalyze exothermic reactions could be attributed
to a combination of (a) global temperature increase in the sample
container and (b) enhanced conformational changes that can lead to
a hydrodynamic enhancement of effective diffusion coefficient.18 Although at present there is no conclusive answer
to this controversial discussion, fully understanding the fundamental
mechanism of the motion of single enzyme is still rather critical
for the development of enzyme-powered micro/nanomachines. Sophisticated
experimental design will be highly desired in order to distinguish
those different effects described before, which will be helpful for
the future design and use of these enzymes as “nanoengines”
to power artificial systems.

DNA–Enzyme Motors
Biological
functions are performed
by highly complex and hierarchical nanomachineries, namely, motor
proteins26,27 and nucleic acids.50 Based on these molecular machines, researchers developed DNA-based
motors that can process information and execute transport over considerable
distances powered by enzymatic reactions. Typically, these motors
consist of single-stranded DNA or RNA that is complementary to domains
present along the patterned tracks. The motion is controlled by cyclic
reactions of hybridization and hydrolysis between the DNA-based motor
and the track, recurring to restriction enzymes that comprehend specific
recognition sites in the hybridized motor–track complex.11−13,51−54

These motors may have applications
as cargo transportation devices or biosensors for highly sensitive
and sequence-specific nucleic acid assays. Despite their programmability
and precise control over the motion along a track,51,53 DNA-based molecular machines’ velocity is limited to rates
around 1 nm/min due to compromises between its endurance and speed.
To tackle these problems, Salaita and co-workers13 designed a DNA-based walker that moves through a cog-and-wheel
mechanism (Figure 2A), which overcomes trade-off issues of multivalent DNA motors and
improves their velocity. Its motion is due to a similar mechanism
as referred to above, and it is powered by the addition of RNase H.
Its directionality is based on a sequence of reactions of DNA complementary
RNA hybridization, hydrolysis by RNase H, and rehybridization with
new ssRNA, occurring with consumption of substrate (ssRNA) as the
motor rolls upon the track.

Li and co-workers54 engineered
a patterned
track and DNA walker conjugated onto the same spherical particle,
which increased local effective concentrations of DNA. This motor
achieves motion through the hybridization of the walker with the DNA
substrate, followed by hydrolysis by a nicking endonuclease.

The majority of DNA-based nanomachines are powered by enzymes with
nucleic acid affinity, such as nucleases, ligases, polymerases, or
nicking enzymes, but those represent only a small fraction of the
enzymes used to catalyze reactions in nature. Recently, Ricci and
co-workers55,56 employed different classes of
non-DNA-recognizing enzymes, namely, proton-producing and proton-consuming
enzymes, to control DNA-based nanodevices through pH-dependent DNA
reactions. The researchers demonstrated that a DNA switch could be
reversibly triggered into opening or closing states by reactions catalyzed
by non-DNA-recognizing enzymes. To do so, they used a pH-dependent
labeled switch56 and engineered the protonation
and deprotonation of the switch using glutathione transferase (GST)
(GSH + CDNB → GS-DNB + HCl) and urease, respectively. Furthermore,
they utilized enzymatic reactions as a way to control the load and
release of ligands using urease to prompt cargo loading and trigger
its release (Figure 2B),55 proving that enzymes can be a wide
toolkit to power biostructures.

Enzyme-Powered Micro/Nanomotors
Enzymes have been used
to power the motion of biologically occurring structures. The ability
of enzymes to provide sufficient driving force to propel larger synthetic
structures has been reported.14,15,57−59 Sánchez and co-workers60 fabricated 400 nm diameter Janus hollow mesoporous silica
nanoparticles (HMSNPs, Figure 3A(a,b)), by coating either silica or metallic element (Ni)
onto one side of a monolayer of the particles through electron beam
evaporation (Figure 3A(c)). Three different enzymes, catalase, urease, or glucose oxidase
(GOx) (β-d-glucose + O2 + H2O
→ gluconic acid + H2O2), were conjugated
onto one face of the particles. Upon addition of corresponding substrates
H2O2, urea, or glucose, all nanomotors exhibited
enhanced diffusion that the authors claim to be generated by a chemophoretic
mechanism. By utilizing an optical trapping technique (Figure 3A(d)), the authors measured
a driving force around 60 fN applied on a catalase-powered nanomotor
(Figure 3A(e)).

Wilson and co-workers14 loaded
enzymes,
such as catalase or catalase and GOx combination, into 500 nm supramolecular
stomatocytes (Figure 3B), achieving self-propulsion by gas expulsion from a very small
opening of these structures. Enzymes were also employed to drive one-dimensional
nanoarchitectures. Feringa and co-workers59 claimed bubble propulsion of glucose oxidase/catalase conjugated
carbon nanotubes (diameter = 20 nm) with addition of glucose and oxygen.
Gáspár and co-workers61,62 conjugated
several enzymes, including GOx, glutamate oxidase, xanthine oxidase,
horseradish peroxidase, and catalase, onto polypyrrole–gold
nanorods whose fuel-dependent enhanced diffusion behavior was explained
by self-electrophoresis based on a bioelectrochemical mechanism (2H+ + 2e– + H2O2 → 2H2O; 2O2 → 2O2•– + 2e–). Such behavior was further utilized for substrate sensing applications.63 Mano and Heller64 coupled another two-enzyme system: glucose oxidase and bilirubin
oxidase, onto a macroscale carbon fiber, which moved by bioelectrochemical
propulsion at the air–liquid interface when fueled with glucose,
resulting in the net bioelectrochemomechanical power-generating reaction
(β-d-glucose +1/2 O2 → δ-glucono-1,5-lactone
+ H2O).

Sen and co-workers16 immobilized two
individual enzymes, catalase and urease, onto the whole surface of
polystyrene particles. The enhanced diffusion of these particles was
explained by a thermal effect due to exothermic enzymatic reactions
(Figure 4A(a)). Nevertheless,
such a hypothesis needs further investigation as pointed out by the
authors. Städler and co-workers65 also immobilized two enzymes, catalase and GOx, onto one face of
Janus silica particles, which also showed enhanced diffusion properties
(Figure 4A(b)). A long-standing
challenge for utilizing micro/nanomotors as drug delivery carriers
is biocompatibility of the whole self-propelled system, which encourages
researchers to design enzymatic motors consuming nontoxic fuels.14−16,65 Although the above-mentioned
works successfully proved the feasibility of using these biocompatible
fuels to power micro/nanomotors, the drawback of randomized movement
due to Brownian activation makes it hard to meet realistic applications.
Very recently, Sánchez and co-workers managed to construct
a fully biocompatible microcapsule motor based on Janus hollow mesoporous
silica spheres with an average diameter of 2.3 μm (Figure 4B(a)). The capability
of long-range movement (>100 μm), with considerable velocity
(>10 μm s–1) for long time at physiological
concentration of urea, makes it a promising candidate for potential
biomedical applications.66 The urea-powered
hollow microcapsule motor demonstrated directional self-propulsion
driven by a phoretic mechanism, which provided experimental evidence
for the theoretical hypothesis given by Golestanian and co-workers
that asymmetric distribution of enzymatic reaction products could
lead to phoretic motion (electrophoresis, diffusiophoresis, or osmiophoresis)
of enzyme-conjugated Janus micro/nanoparticles (Figure 4B(b)).43 However,
for the self-propulsion behavior in the form of enhanced diffusion,
in addition to the phoretic mechanism, other effects of enzymatic
reactions, such as global temperature increase and conformational
changes, might also increase the inherent Brownian motion, leading
to enhancement of the effective diffusion coefficient of the motors.

Following the classic
self-propulsion system based on Pt/H2O2, researchers
initially used catalase to replace
Pt. For instance, Sánchez and co-workers first immobilized
catalase into the tubular micromotor (length of 25 μm) by covalent
linkage and achieved ultrafast movement by bubble propulsion (Figure 4C(a)).67 They improved self-propulsion efficiency by
utilizing enzymatic reactions compared to Pt/H2O2 system. Similar strategy was employed by other research groups,
including He and Wang, to fabricate bubble propulsion tubular micromotors,68−71 where they demonstrated proof-of-concept applications, including
active drug delivery toward cells,68 water
quality testing,69 toxin sensing,70 and decontamination71 applications. Besides tubular micromotors, which can generate bubbles
through one-dimensional confinement, catalase was conjugated onto
one side of Janus particles, as well. With a rough surface (Figure 4C(b))57 or a relatively large size (>10 μm)
(Figure 4C(c))72,73 at the biocatalytic face, oxygen bubbles could generate quickly
and push the motors toward the non-enzyme side. Catalase-based enzymatic
motors by a bubble propulsion mechanism can achieve directional movement
with extremely high velocity up to hundreds of micrometers per second,
more than 10 times higher than the phoretic motion of micromotors
such as urea-powered microcapsule motors, but biotoxicity and high
oxidative activity of H2O2 fuel limited these
motors’ realistic applications, especially in the biomedical
field.

Enzyme-based nano/micromotors have shown, for catalase
enzyme,
high efficiency compared to that with Pt-based counterparts. That
effect was observed in tubular microjets67 and in stomatocyte nanocapsules.14 The
high efficiency of enzyme-based micro/nanomotors could be attributed
to the high catalytic rate of the catalase enzyme and the fact that
enzymes were confined into the cavities of the micro/nanomotors, where
products accumulate and are thereafter expelled through the openings
of the motors as nozzles or jets.

To achieve external control
on the movement of micro/nanomotors,
Sen and co-workers demonstrated one-dimensional guidance of single-enzyme
motors (catalase, urease)4 and enzyme-conjugated
micromotors in a microfluidic setup (Figure 5A).16 The enzymatic
motors prefer to move toward the high concentration region of the
substrate through collective behavior of chemotaxis. Furthermore,
computational models have been developed using surface-bound enzymatic
reactions to organize structures in solution.74 Another common strategy is remote magnetic guidance. Researchers
accomplished directional guidance by incorporating magnetic element,
such as Fe or Ni, into the motors’ structure. Remote control
on the orientation of the enzymatic micromotors was readily available
by applying a magnetic field (Figure 5B(b)).57,66,72 In addition to directional guidance, Sánchez and co-workers66 realized velocity manipulation by tuning the
enzymatic activity of urease with addition of enzyme inhibitors, such
as Hg2+ or Ag+ ions (Figure 5B(a)). Enzyme inhibition property was also
utilized for water quality sensing through direct observation of the
inhibited motion behavior of bubble propulsion microtubular motors.69,71

Enzymatic Micropumps
Nonmechanical
micropumps that
can function without the need for an external power source have great
potential as active biosystems, but the use of nonbiocompatible fuels
hinders their applicability. Sánchez and co-workers developed
a nonmechanical, tunable, catalytic micropump that operates by decomposing
low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, generating
bubbles that provoke fluid flow.75 A myriad
of catalysts can trigger hydrogen peroxide decomposition, among which
are most transition metals and enzyme catalase. However, it is a toxic
fuel, hindering this micropump’s applicability.

As discussed
previously, single enzymes’ diffusion increases in a concentration-dependent
manner.3,4,76 Tethering
enzymes to a fixed surface permits the transfer of this force to the
surrounding environment, moving fluid as well as particles in a directed
fashion. In addition, these micropumps are activated by the presence
of specific compounds, such as substrate molecules and cofactors,
thus enabling the use of such devices both as sensors and triggered
micropumps.17,77

Sen and co-workers designed
multiple triggered micropumps with
the flow rate tunable by analyte concentration.17,78 First, they used the wild-type of the enzyme T4 DNA polymerase,
which can switch the mode of action from polymerase to exonuclease.
In the case of the presence of a single nucleotide, T4 DNA polymerase
action is restricted and the primer strand is shifted back and forth
while the enzyme incorporates and removes nucleotides. By immobilizing
this enzyme onto a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), the researchers
developed a micropump with energy conversion efficiency (10–7)79 comparable to that in previously reported
synthetic systems.78 Later, they made use
of a similar approach with ATP-independent enzymes of distinct classes—catalase,
urease, lipase, and GOx, demonstrating the first examples of ATP-independent
enzyme-based pumps.17 The pumping ability
of each enzyme was assessed by injecting a substrate solution in a
sealed system containing tracer particles (Figure 6C),17,78 which were used to
monitor the speed and directionality of fluid flow. Interestingly,
the convective flow in urease micropump is reversed, contrary to that
in the other micropumps tested. Researchers pointed out that urea
decomposition products by urease catalysis are ionic, which can increase
the density of the fluid near the patterned surface, causing it to
spread along the glass and driving it away from the pattern.80 They hypothesize catalysis-induced density-driven
convective flow as a mechanism for the directional fluid pumping (Figure 6B). Furthermore,
the same group proved the applicability of such pumps as biomedical
devices, demonstrating the triggered release of insulin in response
to glucose (Figure 6A).17

The applications of a self-powered
enzyme-based micropump go beyond
the biomedical field. Recently, Sen’s group demonstrated the
use of urease and catalase pumps as sensors for toxic substances.
Enzymatic activity can be severely affected in the presence of sufficient
concentration of inhibitors, which in enzyme-based micropumps affects
the fluid flow, thus translating into a signal of contamination. This
demonstrates the possibility of using these devices not only as drug
delivery systems but also as sensors and actuators for bioremediation.81

Conclusions and Outlook
Enzymes
are naturally presented as biological “engines”
of molecular machines in biological systems, which convert chemical
energy into mechanical motion in order to accomplish different kinds
of biofunctions. Enzymatic biocatalysis plays a critical role in the
energy conversion process, and therefore, researchers have explored
the fundamental mechanism of these biocatalytic reactions and contributed
considerable efforts to unveil the motion mechanism of enzyme-powered
molecular motors. Recent results suggest that single enzymes have
been investigated as nanomotors exhibiting enhanced diffusion by turning
over corresponding substrate, but debate on their motion mechanism
is still under discussion. Through combination with biological molecules
(e.g., DNA) or organic and inorganic micro/nanoarchitectures
(e.g., silica particles, carbon fibers, metallic
nanorods, microfluidic setup, etc.), enzymes have
been utilized to power micro/nanosystems as self-propelled motors
or pumps. Apart from catalase/H2O2-based bubble
propulsion, there is still a scientific need for understanding the
motion mechanism of enzyme-powered synthetic micro/nanomotors, in
particular, enhanced diffusion of nanomotors and directional/phoretic
motion of micromotors. Current achievements of enzyme-powered micro/nanomachines,
both biological and synthetic, are summarized in Table 1.

At present, enzyme-powered micro/nanomachines
have been proven
to be useful tools in various proof-of-concept applications, presenting
possible solutions for many engineering problems from different fields,
such as environmental protection, biosensing, and nanomedicine. Compared
to conventional inorganic catalyst-based catalytic motors, micro/nanomotors
powered by enzyme-based biocatalytic reactions are advantageous considering
the biocompatibility of enzymes as well as versatile choices of enzymes/fuels
in nature, which allows for future development of biocompatible propulsion
micro/nanosystems. Especially, the recent achievement of biocompatible
fuel-powered micro/nanomotors has aroused significant attention for
the potential of using natural substrate-powered micro/nanomotors
as active drug delivery systems in physiological conditions. However,
the stability and sensitivity of enzymes toward the environment conditions,
such as pH, temperature, and poisonous chemicals, are disadvantages
for enzyme-powered micro/nanomotors. Moreover, other challenges in
a biological environment, including high viscosity, strong flow, and
component complexity of biological fluids, need to be overcome in
the near future. Nevertheless, the field of enzyme-powered micro/nanomachines
has been undergoing a quick growth and attracted increasing interests,
wherein further advancement requires collaboration from multiple disciplines,
including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering.
