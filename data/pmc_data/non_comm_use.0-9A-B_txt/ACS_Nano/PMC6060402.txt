Nanostructured
polymer films with continuous, membrane-spanning
pores from polymerizable hexagonal columnar discotic liquid crystals
(LCs) were fabricated. A robust alignment method was developed to
obtain homeotropic alignment of columns between glass surfaces by
adding a small amount of a tri(ethylene glycol) modified analogue
of the mesogen as a dopant that preferentially wets glass. The homeotropic
LC alignment was fixated via a photoinitiated free radical copolymerization
of a high-temperature tolerant trisallyl mesogen with a divinyl ester.
Removal of the hydrogen-bonded template from the aligned columns afforded
a nanoporous network with pores of nearly 1 nm in diameter perpendicular
to the surface, and without noticeable collapse of the nanopores.
The effect of pore orientation was demonstrated by an adsorption experiment
in which homeotropic film showed a threefold increase in the initial
uptake rate of methylene blue compared to planarly aligned films.

==== Body
Among the
potential applications
of liquid crystal (LC) based functional materials, the development
of nanoporous membranes is one of the most attractive, yet challenging
goals. A high density of monodisperse, nanometer-sized pores in such
membranes is likely to bring about a high flux combined with enhanced
size- and chemical-selectivity for high-throughput ultrafiltration.1,2 In addition, nanoporous membranes with membrane-spanning pores will
likely find their way as selective electrodes in batteries.3−7

For application as adsorption materials, as well as in nanoporous
films, templated hydrogen-bonded discotic liquid crystals (DLCs) containing
polymerizable end-groups have been used.8,9 After polymerization
of the self-assembled nanostructure and removal of the template, nanoporous
materials were obtained. The benefit of DLCs is that, in contrast
to nondynamic materials such as inorganic frameworks, self-assembled
materials can usually be processed more easily to produce large uniform
films. Efforts to develop nanostructured thin films based on polymerizable
discotic liquid crystals has become a well-established research area,
which has already produced a valuable basis for future applications
such as membrane filtration or ion-selective layers.10,11 However, up to now, most of the work has been performed on nonaligned
nanostructured morphologies, with a few exceptions.12,13 In order to further develop this approach toward nanoporous membranes
that can potentially be used as an active layer for nano- and ultrafiltration,
an effective method needs to be developed to obtain pores that span
the entire thickness of the film. Bringing these materials more closely
to practical applications requires homeotropic alignment of the DLCs
with the column director perpendicular to the surface over large areas
prior to polymerization. However, DLCs usually align in a planar fashion,
with the column director parallel to the substrate because a surface
that preferentially interacts with either the core or the periphery
of a DLC will lead to a planar orientation of the columns (Figure 1). When there is
a strong preferential surface-core interaction, it is believed that
the aliphatic tails will form a strongly hydrophilic layer resulting
that the next layer will again planarly align. In case of planar alignment,
large area uniaxial alignment can be obtained by shearing the samples
in the LC-phase. DLCs can also be aligned in a planar fashion by the
help of, e.g., confined geometries such as microchannels or by the
controlled casting from solution.14,15 Unfortunately,
after polymerization and template removal, such films will have low
transport rates because the pores do not span the membrane.

Figure 1 (a) Planar
alignment is obtained when the peripheral alkyl chains
have a stronger interaction with the surface than the cores. (b) When
the cores of the molecules have the stronger interaction, they cover
as much of the surface as possible, and force the alkyl chains to
point up. This creates an apolar surface that leads to a planar alignment
of the following layers. (c) Only by tuning the interfacial energy
to match the entire discotic LC, a homeotropic alignment can be obtained.

Obtaining homeotropic alignment
in thin films of DLCs, however,
is more challenging than obtaining planar alignment, and much effort
has been devoted to this goal.16−18 The use of external fields to
induce a uniform homeotropic alignment has been widely explored, e.g.,
electric field alignment,19 using circularly
polarized IR irradiation to control the alignment,20 or by applying a rotating magnetic field while slowly cooling
down from the isotropic phase.21 The most
common method to induce homeotropic alignment is by tuning the surface
energy of the substrate, e.g. by covering a substrate with a sacrificial
polymer layer that has the proper interfacial energy (Figure 1c).22 When self-alignment of the DLC is homeotropic, large aligned areas
can be obtained by the use of zone-casting.11 The potential of using self-alignment is reflected by the observation
that changing the surface energy of triphenylenes by fluorination,
leads to homeotropic alignment on glass substrates compared to planar
alignment in case of the fully aliphatic homologues.23 Additionally, the interfacial energy between a nematic
LC phase and water has been tuned by the addition of an amphiphilic
dopant to the LC phase, which partitions to the interface, and is
replenished from the bulk.24 Inspired by
this work, we sought to identify surface-active dopants that could
play a similar role at the DLC–glass interface.

In the
present work, homeotropically aligned DLC films are obtained
by modifying the surface energy of the LC phase with a PEG derivative
of the mesogen as a dopant. This alignment methodology is applied
to a reactive mesogen, from which homeotropically aligned DLC based
nanoporous polymer films with 1.3 nm membrane-spanning pores are prepared
(Figure 2). For fixation
of the homeotropic LC films, a high-temperature compatible copolymerization
method of allyl ethers with vinyl esters is used.

As the basis for the current work,
a previously reported hydrogen-bonded
LC complex of a methylated N-heterocyclic template
tris-4-methyl-benzimidazolyl benzene (MeTB) is used, which binds
three organic acids to form a hydrogen-bonded DLC.25−27

Results and Discussion
Homeotropic
Alignment of MeTB·Acid3 Complexes
The 1:3
LC complexes were formed by first dissolving the MeTB template
and the gallic acid derivative in a MeOH/CHCl3 mixture
(1:4 v/v), followed by solvent removal. In polarized optical microscopy
(POM), the 1:3 complex of aliphatic acid 1 and MeTB (MeTB·13) exhibited fan-shaped domains after cooling
down from the isotropic phase, typical for random planar alignment
(Figure 3a). In contrast,
the 1:3 complex with hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) analogue 2, MeTB·23, had birefringent
planar as well as optically isotropic homeotropic domains. The grain
boundaries of the homeotropic domains are highlighted under 45°
crossed polarizers (Figure 3b). Apparently, the switch from apolar–hydrophobic to
polar–hydrophilic tails switched the mode of self-alignment
for the LCs.

fatty acid.
(a) POM image of a multidomain planar aligned LC texture is shown
belonging to the complex MeTB·13. (b)
POM image of the partial homeotropic texture of MeTB·23. Used gap size was 6 μm, and cooling speed was
2.0 °C/min from isotropic phase between glass substrates.

However, for membrane applications,
the use of hydrophilic oligo(ethylene
glycol) containing components must be minimized since they will cause
swelling of the membrane in water changing the morphology. Therefore,
the efficacy of small amounts of hydrophilic acid 2 to
induce homeotropic alignment of MeTB in mixtures with hydrophobic 1 was investigated.

Figure 4 shows the
orientation of thin films of mixtures with intermediate composition,
MeTB·1(3–x)·2x, where x stands
for the equivalents of 2 in the complex. Analysis of
the thermal phase transitions of the mixtures with differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) reveals that MeTB·23 has a low clearing temperature of ∼80 °C while the mixtures
(MeTB·1(3–x)·2x) had a clearing temperature
close to that of MeTB·13 (Figure 4a). Doping the complex with
1 equiv of 2 decreased the isotropization temperature
by ∼20 °C from 240 to 223 °C. The efficacy of inducing
homeotropic alignment by doping with 2 was determined
as follows: 6 μm thick layers of the appropriate MeTB·1(3–x)·2x mixture were put between glass coverslips
and were cooled from the isotropic melt at 2 °C/min until a fully
developed LC texture was observed at approximately 200 °C. The
imaged field was directly used without scanning for optimal images.
The area fraction of homeotropic domains was determined by overlaying
two binarized optical micrographs, each with 90° crossed polarizers,
the second image with both polarizers rotated by 45° relative
to the first micrograph (Figure 4b,c). In such an overlaid representation, homeotropic
domains show up as black.19,23,28−30 The area fraction of homeotropic domains, a measure
for the degree of homeotropic alignment, was determined twice and
the average is plotted as a function of the level of doping with 2 (Figure 4d). The addition of 2 to the mixture induced homeotropic
alignment at slow cooling rates up to 2 °C/min. The homeotropic
area fraction was dominant when the MeTB·1(3–x)·2x complex contained at least 0.1 equiv of 2. Below 0.1
equiv, the homeotropic area quickly drops (Figure 4d). When a higher cooling rate of 5 °C
was used, the required level of doping for predominantly homeotropic
alignment increased to 0.3 equiv of 2. A predominantly
homeotropic sample was also obtained when a low concentration of 2, 0.037 equiv., was combined with an extremely low cooling
rate of 0.1 °C/min. Hence, a small amount of 2 is
sufficient to obtain homeotropic samples.

(e) Homeotropic area fraction of MeTB·13 as a function of cooling speed, corresponds to shown POM images
(b,c). The glass substrate was coated with a 1 wt % solution of 2, thickness < 10 nm.

The effect of hydrophilic 2 on alignment is
most probably
induced by preferential wetting of the glass interface. Upon cooling,
the temperature gradient across the device initiates nucleation of
homeotropic domains at the top surface cover, the nuclei are likely
to grow further toward the bottom glass plate, thus creating homeotropically
aligned LC columns from top to bottom. Increasing the content of 2 promotes the formation of homeotropic domains caused by
increased partitioning of 2 to the glass surface where
the domains nucleate. When the glass surface was spin-coated with
a 1 wt % aqueous solution of 2, a thin layer of less
than 10 nm thick was formed, and the amount of dopant required to
obtain homeotropic alignment could be further reduced to less than
0.1 wt % for a 20 μm thick LC layer (Figure 4b,c,e).

By lowering the cooling speed,
the quality of alignment increased
considerably: a 95% homeotropic sample was obtained with a cooling
rate of 0.2 °C/min (Figure 4e). The two corresponding POM analysis are
shown in Figure 4b,c. Treatment of the glass surface with trichlorododecylsilane gave
full loss of the alignment effect of doping with 2, supporting
the proposed preferential wetting mechanism.

Homeotropically Aligned
Polymer Films
Because of the
alignment efficacy and possibility to fixate the morphology by photopolymerizing
the allylic moieties, MeTB·33 was selected
as monomer for the fabrication of a nanoporous film (Figure 2a). As expected, MeTB·33 showed similar behavior as MeTB·13, the 1:3 complex with 3 aligned homeotropically
when doped with 2. The LC complexes were formed by dissolving
the components in MeOH/CHCl3 (1:4 v/v) followed by drop-casting
on a glass substrate. MeTB·33 displayed
a similar fan-shaped texture as MeTB·13, the presence of a hexagonal columnar (Colhex) phase
in both cases was confirmed with X-ray diffraction (MeTB·13/d(100) = 3.16 nm
vs MeTB·33/d(100) = 3.19 nm). The transition temperatures could not be determined
precisely with DSC since oxidative polymerization set in before the
clearing temperature was reached. The phase transition temperatures
were therefore determined with POM, the following phase sequence was
observed during heating: K–[50 °C]–Colhex–[210 °C]–I. Formation of a 1:3 complex was further
confirmed by ATR FT-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), a number of differences
were observed between the ATR-IR spectra of pure 3 and
MeTB·33 (Figure 5). In the spectrum of the complex, a broad
signal from the N+–H vibrational band at 3259 cm–1 was observed, indicating a strong (ionic-like) hydrogen-bonded
interaction between MeTB and 3. The red-shift of the
acid’s C=O stretch vibration from 1682 to 1673 cm–1, the C–O stretch from 1275 to 1261 cm–1, and the O–H bending frequency from 1333 to
1322 cm–1 upon mixing with MeTB further confirmed
the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex. The additional vibrations
observed at 1450 and 800 cm–1 were assigned as template
specific ring-stretching and ring-bending frequencies.

MeTB·33. (b)
ATR-IR spectra of 3 and MeTB·33. Black dots indicate template specific vibrations.

Since allyl ethers do not readily
form homopolymers by radical
polymerization, MeTB·33 was polymerized
in the presence of divinyl adipate, known to copolymerize with allyl
ethers.31,32 20 wt % of divinyl adipate as a comonomer
(2.7 equiv) was readily taken up by MeTB·33, with a 10 °C decrease in clearing temperature but without
any noticeable changes of the LC texture under POM or in the infrared
spectrum. Avoiding exposure to oxygen prevented the oxidative homopolymerization
of 3, which would result in early polymerization with
low retention of the order. Copolymerization with divinyl adipate
also improved the mechanical properties; homopolymerization of 3 gave very brittle films, presumably due to the low degree
of polymerization.33

Aligning the
LC phase by slowly cooling from the isotropic state
requires that the mixture is able to withstand temperatures up to
the isotropization temperature of ∼210 °C. Allyl ethers
are stable when heated in an inert atmosphere. However, thermally
stable photoinitiators are limited in number, but benzil proved to
be a suitable candidate. When monomer mixtures containing 2 wt % benzil
and comonomer were heated to the isotropization temperature of ∼195
°C, no polymerization took place, but when irradiated with UV
light at 100 °C polymer films of good quality were obtained without
noticeable thermal degradation. Furthermore, the alignment efficacy
of the mixture was not affected by the addition of 20 wt % of divinyl
adipate, 2 wt % benzil, and 5 wt % of 2, although the
clearing point decreased by approximately 15 °C.

Homeotropic
alignment of the monomer mixture was achieved by placing
the material between two glass slides, spaced 6–20 μm
apart, followed by cooling from the isotropic liquid. High cooling
rates of 2–5 °C/min could be used when 0.2 equiv of dopant 2 was present. The relatively high amount of 2 allowed the preparation of homeotropic films of up to 20 μm
thickness. The samples were polymerized by irradiating overnight with
an EXFO photosource equipped with a collimator, which afforded the
desired homeotropically aligned nanostructured polymer films. The
films were easily peeled off from the glass substrates.

Monomer
conversion of the polymer films was analyzed using transmission
infrared spectroscopy instead of ATR-IR to make sure that the
whole film thickness was sampled. The polymerization of the monomers
was confirmed by the disappearance of the C=C vibrational band
at 1648 cm–1 and the =CH and =CH2 out of plane vibrations in the 800–900 cm–1 region (Figure 6).
Furthermore, a shift of the divinyl adipate carbonyl vibration band
was observed from 1758 to 1731 cm–1 confirming the
copolymerization of the vinylic comonomer. Noteworthy is that the
polymerization method did not appear to interfere with the complexation
since the major absorption frequencies of MeTB·33 did not change. The formation of a cross-linked network
was further supported by the observation that the resulting polymer
was insoluble in CHCl3 and DMSO.

radical polymerization. (a) Reaction scheme of polymerization. (b)

In Figure 7a,b,
a polarized optical micrograph with 45° crossed polarizers is
shown together with the medium-angle 2D X-ray diffraction pattern
of the homeotropically aligned polymer sample. The dendritic LC texture
observed by POM is indicative of a homeotropic alignment, with only
the grain boundaries being visible. Decreasing the X-ray beam size
to <1000 μm2 allowed us to selectively probe a
monodomain. The 2D diffractogram showed the typical hexagonally arranged
diffraction spots. With sufficient X-ray irradiation time, higher
order diffraction peaks became also visible. In addition to the d(100) and the d(110) reflections at a mutual angle of 30°, the d(200) reflection became apparent, indicating the high
degree of order within the domain. As expected, in the wide-angle
X-ray diffractogram, no interdisk distance, d(001), was noticed for this particular alignment (data not
shown). The 1D medium-angle X-ray diffractogram of the homeotropically
aligned film is shown in Figure 10c.

boundaries) showing a dendritic morphology. (c) 2D X-ray diffractogram
of a sample with planar alignment obtained by shearing before polymerization.
(d) POM micrograph showing a multidomain planar alignment. Gap size
was 20 μm, cooling speed 2.0 °C/min.

Multidomain planar alignment was obtained by shearing the
same
LC mixture as used for the homeotropic sample at 100 °C between
glass slides spaced 20 μm apart while monitoring the alignment
using POM (Figure 7c,d). After alignment, the sample was polymerized using the same
procedure as was used for the homeotropic sample. Rotating the polymerized
LC film under crossed polarizers showed an alternation of bright and
dark states every 45° confirming the planar alignment. The X-ray
diffractogram of the film showed broadening of the diffraction peaks,
which indicates imperfect alignment and the existence of multiple
domains. In contrast to the homeotropic sample, the interdisk reflection
was observed in the wide-angle X-ray diffractogram of the film with
planar alignment (data not shown).

The two different alignments
of the columnar mesophase were further
studied with transmission IR and vibrational linear dichroism
(Figure 8).34 The individual IR spectra for both
alignments are plotted at different azimuthal angles, with a range
of 0–90° in steps of 10° (Figure 8a,c). For the sample with a planar alignment,
clear dichroism is evident from the stacked spectra (Figure 8a). The molecular vibrational
bands originating from the rigid core (in the fingerprint region)
display a high negative anisotropy, while the N+–H
stretch of MeTB·33 at 3250 cm–1 and the C=O stretch at 1675 cm–1, had a
high positive anisotropy. The orthogonal anisotropy for some of the
core vibrations arises from the difference in the orientation of the IR
transition moments of the respective moieties. The vibrations assigned
to the aliphatic corona, e.g., 1732 cm–1 of the
ester moiety of incorporated divinyl adipate and 725 cm–1 of the aliphatic backbone, are almost fully isotropic.

with planar alignment, a range of 0–90° is shown in steps
of 10°. (c) Stacked IR spectra of homeotropically aligned
polymer films, a range of 0–90° is shown in steps of 10°.
(b,d) Azimuthal plot of two absorption peaks, 1500 and 767 cm–1, for both alignments.

In contrast, the azimuthal scan of the homeotropically aligned
polymer film did not show any anisotropy, indicating vertical alignment
of the columns. Noteworthy, absorption of the aromatic out-of-plane
vibrations is substantially lowered for the homeotropic sample. Because
the columns are aligned vertical, the out-of-plane vibrations are
orthogonal to the polarization vector of the incoming infrared beam.
Additionally, the polar plots are shown for both alignments (Figure 8b,d), with the two
absorption frequencies with the most profound dichroic ratios, 1500
cm–1 (characteristic for aromatic C=C bending)
and 767 cm–1 (a characteristic peak for 3 as well as MeTB), were plotted as a function of the azimuth. A high
dichroic ratio was observed for the sample with planar alignment,
showing C2-symmetry (Figure 8b). For the homeotropic sample,
the dichroic ratio was minimal over 360° (Figure 8d), the observed fluctuation is attributed
to the limited quality of the polarizer.

The columnar order
was also visualized with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) using RuO4 stained side cuts from 6 μm
thick samples embedded in epoxy resin. The obtained image suggests
that the direction of the columns in the planar nonporous sample is
apparently perpendicular to the shearing direction of the film (Figure 9a), which is in contrast with other examples.35−38 Furthermore, the image shows a persistence length of the columns
in the micrometer range. Calculating the Fourier transform of the
image (Figure 9b),
shows a repeating distance of 3.3 nm orthogonal to the columnar director,
which corresponds to the d(100) distance
of 3.23 nm as determined by X-ray diffraction. Azimuthal integration
of the Fourier transformed image from a stained nonporous sample (Figure 9c) revealed two maxima,
spaced 180° apart. The preparation of high-quality TEM samples
is extremely challenging; unfortunately, only side cuts of the planarly
aligned samples were successfully obtained.

aligned film. (b) Fourier transform

following the white dashed line.

Nanoporous thin films were produced by removing the template
from
the polymer network with a solution of conc. HCl (4 wt %) in DMSO
at 75 °C for 16 h (Figure 10a). Transmission IR spectroscopy
confirmed complete removal of the template throughout the whole film
thickness. Notice the disappearance of the N+–H
stretch vibration at 3250 cm–1 and a blue-shift
of the C=O stretch vibration to a higher wavenumber, from 1675
to 1690 cm–1; comparable to pure 3 (Figure 10b). Accessibility
of the acid moieties was verified by converting the free acids to
the corresponding potassium salt by treating the nanoporous network
with 0.04 M KOH solution in 1:1 water/THF at RT for 3 h. Full conversion
of the free acids to the potassium salt was deduced from IR spectroscopy,
which showed the absence of the free acid absorption band at 1690
cm–1 and appearance of an absorption band at 1570
and 1375 cm–1 belonging to the potassium salt (Figure 10b). Most importantly,
XRD showed that after removing the template the hexagonal morphology
was retained in the nanoporous polymer (Figure 10c), a minor 3% shrinkage of the hexagonal
lattice parameter was measured after template removal. Using a synchrotron
X-ray source, it was verified that the homeotropic alignment was preserved
in the porous polymer (Figure 10c,d). These last observations are crucial since the
work of Osuji et al. shows that simpler polymerized acids collapse
after removal of the template.12

removal. (d) 2D X-ray diffractogram of the corresponding −COOK
lined porous polymer.

From the lattice parameter of the nanostructured polymer
network
(a = 3.73 nm) combined with the molecular weight
of the template (Mw = 468.56 g/mol) and
the molecular weight of the unit cell (Mw = 3591 g/mol), the pore diameter was estimated to be 1.3 nm, which
corresponds to a porosity of approximately 13%. In addition, it is
believed that nonpolymerizable dopant 2 was also removed
to a great extent, if not fully, decreasing the overall material density
without effecting the material its selectivity. The latter is governed
by the smallest pore diameter.

A competitive adsorption experiment
(1.5 mL, 10 μM, 0.005
equiv of dye, 2 h) between positively charged methylene blue and negatively
charged sodium fluorescein showed that the nanoporous film with −COOK
lined pores (3.1 mg, Mw = 3188 g/mol)
selectively adsorbed methylene blue into the negatively charged pores
while leaving the sodium fluorescein concentration unaffected (Figure 11c). Additionally,
the difference between homeotropic and planar films was demonstrated
by adsorbing methylene blue from solution (Figure 11). The aligned nanoporous films of approximately
0.1 mg (20 μm thick) with −COOK lined pores were exposed
to methylene blue solution (2.0 mL, 52 μM, 1 equiv of dye),
the concentration of dye was monitored over time by measuring the
absorbance at 588 nm spectrophotometrically. From the decrease in
absorption, the methylene blue adsorption was calculated using Lambert–Beer’s
law (ε588 nm = 20767 M–1·cm,
H2O), expressed as the mass fraction qe. The initial uptake of the films, the first 15 min,
showed that the homeotropically aligned film adsorbed methylene blue
3–4 times faster than the film with planar alignment (Figure 11a). However, both
the uptake speed and equilibrium adsorption of both films were similar
during uptake over a longer time (Figure 11b).

time-scale) (a) for the
planar and homeotropic films and (b) for a long time-scale. (c) Selective
uptake of methylene blue in a competitive experiment between methylene
blue and sodium fluorescein.

Fitting the obtained concentration profile to a pseudo-first
order
reaction limited adsorption model gave a good quantitative description
of the data (Figure 11b).39−41 From the obtained fitted parameters (k1, qe) using a least-squares
optimization method, it can be seen that on the long scale both films
have taken up the same amount of dye (qe ∼ 4.6 mg/g) with a similar rate coefficient k1. Hence, in the steady-state, both films behave the same,
meaning that the resistance for dye uptake on longer time scales lies
in the film itself and is not governed by pore entry. The better accessibility
of pore ends in the homeotropically aligned sample likely caused the
initial fast adsorption.

Conclusions
The self-assembly properties
of discotic liquid crystals have successfully
been harnessed to prepare homogeneous homeotropically aligned nanostructured
polymer networks. A photoinitiated free radical polymerization method
compatible with the high temperatures needed for alignment was developed.
This method consisted of copolymerizing the tris-allylic LC monomers
with a vinyl ester as comonomer with a thermally stable initiator.

Homeotropic, face-on alignment was induced by addition of a hydrophilic
analogue of the monomer as a dopant. Samples with planar alignment
were obtained by unidirectionally shearing the LC, with the same composition,
prior to fixation. Removal of the hydrogen-bonded
template yielded a nanoporous polymer network with membrane-spanning
near-1 nm pores. The presence of free carboxylic acid groups was illustrated
by conversion to the corresponding potassium salt. The initial uptake
of methylene blue was 3–4 times faster in homeotropically aligned
films than in planar samples, while at longer times both materials
have similar uptake speed and equilibrium.

The method to prepare
nanoporous membranes with near-1 nm pores
from polymerizable DLCs offers ample opportunities to develop fully
functional materials. The strategy presented here can be easily extended
toward the fabrication of functioning active layers for membrane technologies.
The strategy of tuning the LC-interfacial energy can be generally
applied under the condition that the additive is miscible and does
not interfere with the LC self-assembly.

General
Commercially purchased chemicals were used
without further purification. MeTB and tri(ethylene glycol) analogue 2 were prepared according to their reported synthesis.26,27 Column chromatography was carried out using silica gel (0.035–0.070
mm, ca. 6 nm pore diameter). ATR FT-IR spectra were recorded at room
temperature on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two spectrometer equipped with
a universal attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling accessory.
Transmission FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Varian 670 IR spectrometer,
equipped with a microscope setup. Scans were taken over a range of
4000–400 cm–1, with a spectral resolution
of 4 cm–1, 100 scans per spectrum. Processing of
the transmission FT-IR spectra was done using Varian FTS 3000 Excalibur
Resolutions, version 4.0.5.009, software. NMR spectra were recorded
at room temperature on a Bruker, FT-NMR spectrometer AVANCE III HD-NanoBay
(400 MHz, Bruker UltraSchield magnet, BBFO Probehead, BOSS1 shim assembly)
in CDCl3. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with respect
to tetramethylsilane (TMS, 0 ppm). Coupling constants are reported
as J-values in Hz. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was performed
on a Bruker, speed autoflex, operated in reflectron mode with a positive
voltage polarity, 500 shots. Cesium tri-iodide was used as calibration
reference. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA, 20 mg/mL) and trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile
(DCTB, 30 mg/mL) were used as the matrix. Samples were prepared by
mixing 1 μL (1 mg/mL) of sample 1:1 with the matrix solution,
after which the mixture was spotted on the MALDI plate. It was noticed
that the tris-allyl 3 polymerizes/decomposes during drying of the
MALDI plate; direct insertion of the plate after spotting solved this
problem. Exact molecular masses were calculated using IsoPro 3.0,
MS/MS Software. POM was performed with a Jeneval microscope equipped
with crossed polarizers, a Linkam THMS 600 heating stage, and a Polaroid
DMC le CCD camera. DSC measurements were performed in hermetic T-zero
aluminum sample pans using a TA Instruments Q2000–1037 DSC
instrument equipped with a RCS90 cooling accessory. Transition temperatures
and enthalpies were typically determined from the first cooling and
first heating run using Universal Analysis 2000 software (TA Instruments,
USA), with heating and cooling rates of 10 K/min. X-ray scattering
measurements were performed on a Ganesha lab instrument equipped with
a Genix-Cu ultralow divergence source producing X-ray photons with
a wavelength of 0.154 nm and a flux of 1 × 108 photons
s–1. Diffraction patterns were collected using a
Pilatus 300 K silicon pixel detector with 487 × 619 pixels of
172 μm2 in size, placed at a sample to detector distance
of 91 mm (wide angle, WAXS), or 500 mm (medium angle, MAXS). On the
obtained diffraction patterns an azimuthal integration was performed,
using SAXSGUI software, to calculate the intensity against the scattering
vector q, where q = (4π/λ)sin ϑ
(ϑ is the angle of incidence and λ is the wavelength).
The beam center and the q-range were calibrated using
silver behenate (d(100) = 1.076 nm–1; 5.839 nm), as a reference. The d(300) was used for calibration. Temperature was controlled
with a Linkam HFSX350 heating stage and cooling unit. Measurements
were performed on bulk samples sealed in 1.0 mm diameter glass capillaries,
0.01 mm wall thickness (Hilgenberg). Beam size was minimized (∼30
μm in diameter) for the homeotropic sample to ensure the sampling
of a monodomain. The planar sample and the monomer mixture were measured
using a normal, wider, beam. Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering
(GISAXS) measurements were performed at the BM26B-DUBBLE beamline
at the ESRF. An X-ray wavelength of λ = 0.1 nm was used with
2 and 4 m sample-to-detector distances. GISAXS images were recorded
using a solid state silicon photon counting Pilatus 1 M detector with
pixel size of 172 × 172 μm and active surface dimension
of 179 × 169 cm. The scattering angle scale 2θ was calibrated
using the position of diffraction rings from silver behenate powder.
Direct and reflected beam positions were measured directly on the
detector using a 2 mm Al filter to reduce the direct beam intensity
and avoid detector damage. The nominal incident angles αi were accurately recalibrated using the measured reflected
beam position and the known sample-to-detector distance. Different
angles of incidence αi ranging from 0.08° to
1.1° were used in order to allow increased penetration depth
of the supported networks. Background scattering from air was subtracted
to every image before further analysis. Scattering from glass substrate
was not subtracted as it contributes much less than the sample to
the experimentally measured GISAXS intensity. Sample preparation for
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was as follows: the thin films
were embedded in an epoxy resin, EPOFIX, and cured at 70 °C,
1 h. Ultrathin sections were obtained at room temperature using a
Leica Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome, equipped with a Diatome
45° knife, set to 60–70 nm thickness. The cross sections
were transferred to a 200/400 mesh copper grid with a carbon support
layer. The sections were additionally stained with RuO4 vapor for 15 min, using a freshly prepared RuCl3/hypochlorite
solution.42 The imaging was performed on
a TU/e CryoTitan (FEI) is equipped with a field emission gun operating
at 300 kV and with a postcolumn Gatan energy filter. Images were recorded
using a 2 k × 2 k Gatan CCD camera. The LC mixtures were prepared
as follows: the required amount of acid and template were measured
separately; typically, 20 mg of total sample was obtained. The acid
was analytically transferred to the template using 500 μL of
chloroform. To ensure full dissolution of all components, 100 μL
of methanol was added. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator,
and the mixture was further dried using a vacuum pump (<1 mbar).
Before testing, each sample was thoroughly mixed. The monomeric mixtures
containing reactive mesogens were prepared from stock solutions: solution
1:15 μmol solution of MeTB·33 complex
(∼20 mg/mL) in 20 v/v % MeOH/CHCl3, solution 2:67,5
μmol divinyl adipate, 6 μmol benzil, 9 μmol tri(ethylene
glycol) analog 2, dissolved in 20 v/v % MeOH/CHCl3. The appropriate samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes
of solutions 1 and 2 and drop casting the final solution on the substrate
at 50 °C (to prevent oxidative polymerization). To obtain the
homeotropic alignment: after placing the cover substrate, the sample
was heated to the isotropic temperature followed by cooling 2 K/min
to 100 °C. For the planar aligned sample the mixture was directly
heated to 100 °C, and manually sheared in one direction until
an acceptable degree of alignment was achieved as was judged from
the POM by the naked eye. Polymerization of the samples was done at
100 °C, irradiation time was 900 min. (15 h). Different ways
of treating the glass surface, i.e., no treatment, washing with i-propanol,
UV-ozone treatment, or treating with piranha solution (3:1, conc.
H2SO4/H2O2 30%), had no
noticeable effect on the alignment efficacy.

Synthetic Procedures
Synthesis of 3,4,5-tris((11-(allyloxy)undecyl)oxy)benzoic
acid (5): Methyl gallate (200 mg, 1.09 mmol, 1 equiv) was added to
a suspension of potassium carbonate (1.5 g, 10.9 mmol, 10 equiv) in
DMF (7 mL). The slurry was heated to 75 °C, for 30 min. 1-(Allyloxy)-11-bromoundecane
(1 g, 1 mmol, 1 equiv), prepared using a reported procedure,43 was dissolved in DMF (1 mL) and was slowly added
to the suspension using a syringe. The slurry was stirred overnight
at 75 °C, the round-bottom flask was sealed using a U-tube filled
with mineral oil. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature,
followed by filtration over a silica plug (5 g) using chloroform.
Separating the methyl ester from the starting bromide tail was unsuccessful.
The crude mixture was therefore directly hydrolyzed to the final acid;
the crude wax was treated with the following mixture: KOH (1 g), water
(2.5 mL), MeOH (7.5 mL) and THF (10 mL) for 1 h. Conversion was checked
with TLC (silica, heptane/CHCl3/EtOH/AcOH, 7:2.5:0.5:0.1,
Rf = 0.28). The final compound 5 was isolated
by column chromatography (80 g silica, heptane/CHCl3/EtOH/AcOH,
7:2.5:0.3:0.1) affording 348 mg of a white wax, overall 40% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C, TMS): δ
