Biomimetic
and stimuli-responsive cell-material interfaces are
actively being developed to study and control various cell-dynamics
phenomena. Since cells naturally reside in the highly dynamic and
complex environment of the extracellular matrix, attempts are being
made to replicate these conditions in synthetic biomaterials. Supramolecular
chemistry, dealing with noncovalent interactions, has recently provided
possibilities to incorporate such dynamicity and responsiveness in
various types of architectures. Using a cucurbit[8]uril-based host–guest
system, we have successfully established a dynamic and electrochemically
responsive interface for the display of the integrin-specific ligand,
Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), to promote cell adhesion. Due to the weak nature
of the noncovalent forces by which the components at the interface
are held together, we expected that cell adhesion would also be weaker
in comparison to traditional interfaces where ligands are usually
immobilized by covalent linkages. To assess the stability and limitations
of our noncovalent interfaces, we performed single-cell force spectroscopy
studies using fluid force microscopy. This technique enabled us to
measure rupture forces of multiple cells that were allowed to adhere
for several hours on individual substrates. We found that the rupture
forces of cells adhered to both the noncovalent and covalent interfaces
were nearly identical for up to several hours. We have analyzed and
elucidated the reasons behind this result as a combination of factors
including the weak rupture force between linear Arg-Gly-Asp and integrin,
high surface density of the ligand, and increase in effective concentration
of the supramolecular components under spread cells. These characteristics
enable the construction of highly dynamic biointerfaces without compromising
cell-adhesive properties.

Interactions
between cells and
their extracellular matrix (ECM) have been extensively studied over
the past couple of decades, yielding specifics on binding partners,
motifs, and strengths. These specifics have spurred improved designs
of biomaterials aimed to better integrate these materials with cells
and tissue.1 The identification of the
fibronectin-derived tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) as an integral ECM
component that mediates cell adhesion via integrins
has in particular led to the development of numerous artificial biointerfaces.2−4 Consequently, studies have shown that spatial orientation and distribution
of this simple peptide influences cell adhesion, spreading, migration,
and stem cell differentiation.5−10 Stimuli-responsive platforms have additionally allowed us to gain
control over the temporal availability of this RGD peptide, resulting
in the possibility of eliciting cellular responses.11−14

For developing such biomimetic
and responsive interfaces, supramolecular
systems, dealing with molecular components assembled through noncovalent
interactions, have become increasingly attractive.15−17 The dynamic
nature of the individual components in these systems has been suggested
to better mimic the ECM, which is known to constantly undergo reorganization.
Furthermore, the possibility to introduce stimuli responsiveness by
careful selection of individual components allows for manipulation
of cells using, for example, pH, electricity, or light. Despite the
encouraging progress made using supramolecular systems, a deeper understanding
of the constituent interactions is required to make further advances.

Recently, we have shown that self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of
cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and its associated guests allow the presentation
of bioactive ligands in a dynamic and reversible manner.18−22 We have used such SAMs to address and manipulate prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells.18−21 In particular, SAMs of CB[8] anchored to the surface using methyl
viologen (MV2+) as the first electron-poor aromatic guest
and a second electron-rich aromatic guest that displays the RGD peptide
motif were used for the construction of an electrochemically responsive
platform for cell adhesion.18,19 Electrochemical reduction
of MV2+ to the radical cation form (MV+•) resulted in the disassembly of the ternary complex and enabled
the controlled detachment of either the whole cell or a desired subcellular
region. Furthermore, the individual host–guest affinities (Ka = 105–106 M–1)23,24 occur in a range that allows
a high level of ligand dynamicity at the surface, especially considering
the high rate of association (ka = 9.6
× 107 M–1 s–1)
and rapid rate of dissociation (kd = 1200
s–1) for the second guest, naphthol (Np).25 Due to these properties of responsiveness and
dynamicity, this supramolecular platform could potentially be used
as a powerful tool to trigger and study complex cellular phenomena.
Despite promising results in preliminary studies,18,19 it is possible that cell adhesion does not occur on these noncovalently
assembled surfaces to the same extent as it does on more traditional
biomaterial surfaces where ligands are immobilized in a covalent manner.26−28 For further development of this platform and other such promising
supramolecular systems, it is important to gain in-depth understanding
of the cellular interactions involved.

With this perspective
in mind, we have attempted to gain a better
understanding of the forces involved between adhered cells and our
supramolecular surfaces using a versatile single-cell force spectroscopy
technique called fluid force microscopy (FluidFM).3 Previously, single-cell force spectroscopy has been successfully
performed by various groups using AFM cantilevers functionalized with
cell-adhesive ligands.29−31 Such cantilevers have been used to pick up individual
cells and bring them in contact with a desired surface. After allowing
the cell to adhere for a certain, short period of time, the cantilever
would be retracted, and the rupture force between the cell and surface
could be determined. Using this technique, rupture forces were determined
at scales from single molecules to single cells depending on the time
of contact between the cell and surface.29−31 However, this
versatile technique is immensely time consuming to study whole-cell
adhesive forces in a statistically significant manner. Furthermore,
since the cell is always held by the AFM cantilever, its adhesive
properties toward surfaces might be not representative when compared
to when cells adhere freely from solution and stably spread over the
course of hours.

In contrast, FluidFM enables the achievement
of more relevant force
statistics on the scale of entire cells and allows probing cells that
have adhered to surfaces in an unhindered manner.32 As shown in Figure 1a, FluidFM utilizes an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever
with an integrated microchannel. The device functions as an AFM with
the possibility to perform aspiration by applying negative pressure
and dispensing by applying positive pressure through the microchannel,
like a miniscule pipet. For single-cell adhesion force measurements,33 a surface with adhered cells is slowly approached
with the cantilever until the aperture on the tip of the microchannel
makes contact with the target cell. An under pressure is then applied
through the microchannel, and the cantilever is slowly retracted,
resulting in the cell being detached from the surface as shown in Figure 1b. The entire measurement
lasts approximately 10 min and can be repeated over several hours.
Previously, FluidFM has been successfully used for measuring and comparing
adhesion forces of HeLa and HEK cells on fibronectin-coated tissue
culture plates,33 for determining endothelial
cell adhesion forces on different charged microstructured substrates34 as wells as for studying the changes in adhesion
forces of C2C12 cells due to an applied electric current.35

In this study, we performed single-cell force spectroscopy
to probe
cell adhesive strengths on surfaces with noncovalently immobilized
peptide ligands. Using FluidFM, we prove that cells adhere with similar
forces to surfaces displaying RGD in a traditional covalent manner
and in a dynamic noncovalent manner. We also discuss the possible
supramolecular mechanisms behind our results.

Results
Two types
of RGD-presenting surfaces were analyzed by cell-adhesion
force measurements. Both surfaces were made up of a well-packed background
mixed monolayer consisting of dimeric tetraethylene glycol alkanethiols
in which 1% contained reactive maleimide groups (Figure 1a). In the case of the covalent
surfaces, an RGD peptide with a cysteine residue was conjugated directly
to the maleimide. In the case of the noncovalent surfaces, a thiolated
MV2+ was conjugated to the maleimides to which CB[8] was
able to bind. An RGD-containing peptide conjugated with a naphthol
unit (Np-RGD) acted as the second guest and allowed RGD to be presented
on the surface in a noncovalent way. On both of these surfaces, cell
spreading occurred similarly over several hours using mouse myoblast
cells (C2C12), as indicated by their cell areas in Figure 2a. A MV2+-conjugated
surface (without both CB[8] and Np-RGD) and a MV2+ with
CB[8] were used as the negative control surfaces on which cells adhered
less and remained rounded for several hours, indicating that the adhesion
of cells was indeed mediated by specific interactions to RGD (Figure 2a, Supporting Information Figure S1 and S2). Cells adhering to
both covalent and noncovalent surfaces had well-formed focal adhesions
and actin networks during the course of several hours (Figure 2b). These results verified
that cell adhesion and spreading occurred in a similar manner on both
covalent and noncovalent surfaces.

the mean, and the whiskers represent the standard deviation (STD)

surfaces = 1330 ± 523 μm2. (b) Fluorescence

(green), and cell nuclei (blue). Magnified images of the vinculin
staining have been provided for better visibility of the focal adhesion.
Time points indicated on the top left of the images correspond to
number of hours after cell seeding.

Cell-adhesion force measurements were then performed on three
types
of surfaces using the FluidFM device. A typical force spectroscopy
curve from such cell pick-up experiments is presented in Figure 3a. The initial drop
in force represents the bending of the cantilever that is being retracted
after being brought in contact with a cell. The maximum adhesion force
is the point where the force to bend the cantilever equals the cell-adhesion
force. Beyond this point, the cell detaches from the surface, and
the cantilever returns to its original shape, represented by the force
curve returning to its initial value. The total distance required
to pull a cell off the surface is measured from the initial point
where the cantilever bending begins to when it reaches its original
shape again. The area of the shaded region in the force–distance
curve represents the work done by the cantilever to detach a cell
from the surface and corresponds to the binding energy of a cell with
the surface. Representative force–distance curves for the three
types of substrates used are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S3).

and (d) total work done in the cell pick-up experiments from gold
surfaces coated with serum proteins (n = 10 cells),

boxes correspond to the first and third quartiles, the line in the

mean, and the whiskers represent the standard deviation (STD) of the
data sets. Statistical significance between unpaired data sets determined
by the Mann–Whitney U-test have been denoted by a * for p < 0.05.

Cells were allowed to adhere and spread on the covalent and
noncovalent
surfaces for an hour after which the force–distance curves
were measured for a time period of up to 4 h. Additionally, gold surfaces
coated with serum proteins were used as the standard for comparing
the values obtained from the two types of surfaces. The mean ±
STD cell area on this surface was determined to be 919 ± 314
μm2. In total, 10 cells were successfully picked
up from the serum-coated surfaces, 40 cells from the covalent surfaces,
and 49 cells from the noncovalent surfaces. This represents approximately
50% of all attempted pick ups at an average rate of 4 attempts per
hour. Two substrates were used for serum-coated surfaces and seven
each for the covalent and noncovalent surfaces. The rounded cells
on the negative control surfaces did not display any measurable detachment
force and were not included in the analysis. From Figure 3b–d, it can be seen
that the maximum force, the detachment distance, and the total work
required to detach the cells from both covalent and noncovalent surfaces
were very similar and comparable to the serum-coated surfaces. The
median force values for cell detachment in the covalent (425 nN) and
noncovalent (409 nN) samples were higher than that of the serum-coated
surface (236 nN), indicating that cells adhered well to these surfaces.
Since the data sets follow Gaussian distribution with outliers, the
nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test was applied, and it was determined
that significant differences did not exist between the covalent and
noncovalent surfaces for any of the three parameters. However, statistical
significance was observed between the serum-coated and noncovalent
surfaces in terms of force and work values for cell detachment. The
results suggest that, even though the components in the noncovalent
surfaces were held together by relatively weak forces, cell adhesion
strength was similar to covalent surfaces and better than serum-coated
surfaces. From the mean rupture force and cell surface area values,
the rupture force density was calculated to be approximately 0.35
nN/μm2 for the covalent system and 0.36 nN/μm2 for the noncovalent system. These values indicate that both
types of surfaces very likely produce a similar number of RGD-integrin
interactions per unit area and are in accordance with values obtained
in previous studies using covalently immobilized RGD surfaces.29,36 Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences
in the cell detachment distances between the three experimental groups
in accordance with the fact that the cell areas on all three surfaces
were similar.

Since the supramolecular ternary complex on the
noncovalent surface
can completely dissociate from the surface within an hour, cell adhesion
toward this surface may weaken over time. To address this, the force,
distance, and work values were binned over successive 1 h time periods
from 1 to 5 h after cell seeding (Figure 4). It can be seen that cells on covalent
surfaces do not show any significant change in cell-adhesion parameters
over time, as expected. The cells adhering to noncovalent surfaces
also clearly display no significant decline in all three parameters,
indicating that the noncovalently bound RGD ligand does not entirely
dissociate from the surface in this time period.

third quartiles, the line in the middle corresponds to the median,
and the whiskers represent the standard deviation of the data sets.

Discussion
Traditionally, bioactive
ligands are immobilized onto biomaterials
through stable covalent linkages, ensuring that the ligands are always
available for cells to interact with them. However, in nature, most
ligands are presented in a constantly changing and dynamic environment.
Mimicking such an environment has proven to be a considerable challenge
for which supramolecular chemistry has recently provided innovative
solutions.15 Using host–guest systems,
ligands can be presented in a dynamic and responsive manner, but the
forces by which they are held together are much weaker in comparison
to covalent bonds. For instance, covalent bonds have rupture forces
in the order of nNs,37 whereas a typical
host–guest complex such as β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-adamantane
(Ad) (Ka = 5 × 104 M–1) has a rupture force of 100 pN.38 Based on these values, it is natural to expect that such
host–guest complexes would perform poorly when addressing cell
behavior such as adhesion to surfaces. In spite of this, we have observed
that cell adhesion, spreading, and contractility on our host–guest
complex-based noncovalent surfaces are very similar to what is seen
on covalent surfaces (Figure 2b). In this study, we discovered that cell-adhesive forces
on our noncovalent surfaces are comparable to that of covalent surfaces.
To understand this, we took a closer look into the binding parameters
of these systems. In the covalent system, RGD is rigidly bound to
the surface, so the weakest link between the cell and the surface
is the noncovalent interaction between the RGD peptide and the integrins
residing in the cell membrane. The measured rupture force most likely
corresponds to the breaking of these interactions. The rupture force
in the noncovalent system being similar to that of the covalent system
indicates that in both systems, the RGD-integrin complex is probably
the weakest link. The association and dissociation rate constants
between Np and the CB[8]-MV2+ complex (ka = 9.6 × 107 M–1 s–1, kd = 1200 s–1)25 are similar to that of the β-CD-Ad
complex mentioned above (ka = 108 M–1 s–1, kd = 2000 s–1).38 So, it is fair to assume that the rupture force of the ternary complex
could be comparable to the 100 pN of the β-CD-Ad complex based
on a theory developed by Evans et al.,39 which predicts that the rupture force is inversely
proportional to ln(kd). In addition, force
spectroscopy studies on individual RGD-integrin complexes have shown
that the force required to disassemble this complex is approximately
40 pN.29,40 The RGD-integrin rupture force being less
than half compared to that of the Np-(CB[8]-MV2+) complex
supports our weakest link hypothesis.

Another observation is
that the rupture force of cells adhered
on our noncovalent surfaces does not diminish over several hours.
Dissociation of Np and CB[8] from the surface is expected to occur
over time in the cell medium since the equilibrium would be shifted
to favor the dissociated state. In previous studies using QCM and
SPR, we determined that such dissociation occurs in neutrally buffered
solutions within tens of minutes.19 To
understand how cells remain adhered to our noncovalent surfaces over
several hours, we considered the ligand densities at the surface.
Mooney and co-workers have shown that C2C12 cells adhere and spread
well on surfaces with RGD ligand densities as low as 1 fmol/cm2 (corresponding to 6 ligands per μm2).36 In another study, Heilshorn and co-workers varied
the RGD density on their surfaces from 16 to 160 pmol/cm2 and concluded that even their lowest density was sufficient to saturate
the integrin receptors on the surface of C2C12 cells.41 On the 1% mol maleimide SAM that was used, based on the
dimensions of CB[8] (outer diameter =1.75 nm)42 and assuming hexagonal packing, a maximum surface density of CB[8]
and Np-RGD can be ca. 61 pmol/cm2. This
indicates that the RGD ligands density on our noncovalent surfaces
is very likely a few orders of magnitude higher than what is sufficient
for cell adhesion and spreading even if considerable dissociation
of the ligand occurs. Furthermore, once seeded, cells settle on the
surface and adhere within a matter of minutes. After adhesion and
spreading, the cell membrane is typically separated from the underlying
surface by the cellular glycocalyx, which has been determined to span ca. 10–20 nm.43 Such a
cell, spread on the noncovalent surfaces, would prevent rapid dissociation
of the supramolecular components by limiting the free volume available
to them and consequently increasing their effective concentration.
Under the cell membrane, assuming an average distance from the surface
to be 20 nm, the noncovalently interacting molecules would experience
a local concentration of ∼30 mM. This is 3 orders of magnitude
higher than the dissociation constant of the Np-(CB[8]-MV2+) complex (Kd = 12.5 μM).19 Thus, within the time period in which cell adhesion
and spreading occurs, there would still exist a sufficient density
of ligands at the surface to ensure that the equilibrium favors the
associated state of the supramolecular ternary complex. All of these
factors combined would be able to ensure stable cell adhesion on noncovalent
surfaces over the time span that was probed.

Conclusions
In
this study, we have shown that the actin filaments, focal adhesions,
adhesion forces, and cell contractility between cells adhering to
the covalent and noncovalent surfaces are comparable using fluorescence
microscopy and FluidFM-based single-cell force spectroscopy. Although
the bioactive ligands are held together through relatively weaker
forces in the noncovalent surfaces compared to the covalent surfaces,
the total cell adhesive forces on both surfaces were found to be very
similar. We postulated that such a surprising result is due to a combination
of factors including the weak rupture force between linear RGD and
integrin, high surface density of the ligand, and increase in effective
concentration of the supramolecular components under spread cells.
The platform presented is dynamic, responsive, and can be modified
in a highly versatile manner. The ligand’s affinity to the
surface can be modified by using other or multivalent guest molecules.
RGD’s affinity toward integrins can be modified by either using
cyclic RGD or introducing different adjacent amino acids. The combination
of noncovalent surfaces and FluidFM represents a powerful system for
gaining further insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms of
cell-surface interactions. Further investigations are being conducted
by modulating the bioactive ligand’s binding strength, valency,
and stimuli responsiveness to understand the effects of these parameters
on cell contractility and migration.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Cucurbit[8]uril, cucurbit[7]uril, β-trypsin
from bovine pancreas, and methyl viologen were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The disulfides (bis-1-(11-{tetraethylene glycol}-undecyl) disulfide
(EG4C11S)2 and N-{2-(2,5-dioxo-2,5-dihydro-pyrrol-1-yl)-ethyl}-[2-[11-(11-(tetraethylene
glycol)-undecyldisulfanyl)-undecyloxy]-hexaethylene glycol-acetamide])
Mal-EG6C11SSC11EG4) for
SAM preparation were purchased from ProChimia. Alkyl thiol terminated
MV2+ (MV2+-SH) was synthesized as previously
reported.44 NpGGRGDSG (Np-RGD) was synthesized
using an automatic solid-phase synthetic robot (Syro II, Multisyntech)
following standard Fmoc procedures on RinkAmide resin. GGCGGRGDS (C-RGD)
was synthesized with a MultiPep RSi, Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments
using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis protocols on a Wang resin.
Purification was done by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC (Waters)), followed by analysis with analytical HPLC and mass
spectrometry. Because of the poor solubility of CB[8] in water and
its hygroscopic nature, the apparent molecular weight of the commercial
powder and its actual concentration in aqueous solutions were determined
for each batch using a simple and highly reproducible method described
previously.45 CB[8] was dissolved in Milli-Q
water by sonication at 80 °C for 2 h.

Substrates and Chamber
As a substrate for the cell
adhesion, we used a 4.9 × 4.9 cm glass substrates coated with
a 20 nm-thick gold layer. Appropriate monolayers were assembled on
these substrates as already described.18,20 The cell chamber
consisted of a poly(methyl methacrylate) base and a polytetrafluoroethylene
housing. The chamber and the substrate together were cleaned by incubating
with Tergazyme (Alconox, USA) for 20 min, followed by thorough rinsing
with Milli-Q. The chamber was sterilized in 70% ethanol for at least
20 min and allowed to dry under sterile conditions before mounting
the substrate.

Preparation of SAMs on Gold Substrate
Gold substrates
were first washed with piranha solution (H2SO4 + 30% H2O2, v/v 3/1), copious amounts of Milli-Q
water, and finally with ethanol. Substrates were then immersed overnight
in a 1 mM ethanolic solution of (EG4C11S)2 and Mal-EG6C11SSC11EG4 at a molar ratio of 99:1 at room temperature in the dark.
The substrates were then cleaned thoroughly with ethanol, Milli-Q
water, and dried with a stream of N2 gas. They were then
immediately incubated with 1 mM MV2+-SH in pH 6.8 50 mM
phosphate buffer for 1 h. The substrates were then washed thoroughly
with Milli-Q water, dried with N2 gas, and used for further
conjugation of either MV2+-SH or C-RGD.

The serum-coated
surfaces were prepared by incubating clean gold substrates in DMEM/F-12
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for a half hour
to allow adhesion of serum proteins onto gold. These substrates were
then directly used for culturing cells.

FluidFM
A custom
built FluidFM platform, called Skeleton,46 was used together with a tipless FluidFM cantilever
(Cytosurge AG, Zürich, Switzerland) with an aperture of 8 μm.
The cantilever spring constant (k) was calibrated
using the Sader method48 and was found
to be between 1.7 and 2.3 N/m. The bending of the cantilever was measured
by optical beam deflection (OBD),47 and
the position of the beam on a photodetector was measured in volts
(V). Before each experiment, the deflection sensitivity
(S [V/nm]) of the cantilever was measured by allowing
the cantilever to bend on a cell-free spot on the substrate and relax
again during which changes in the photodetector voltage was monitored.
The force was derived from 1  

The Skeleton was operated on a Zeiss
AXIOVERT 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). The
over- and underpressure in the FluidFM cantilever were established
with a pressure controller (Cytosurge) in a range from −800
mbar to +1000 mbar with 1 mbar resolution and a settling time of 200
ms.

Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells (American Type Cell Collection)
were
used in all the experiments. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (all from Thermo Fisher
Scientific AG, Switzerland). Approximately 100,000 cells were seeded
on the substrates in 4 mL of serum-free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific
AG, Switzerland) and allowed to adhere and spread for 1 h before the
force–distance curves were measured. DMEM with serum was used
for cells seeded on serum-coated surfaces.

Prior to the force
measurements, the cantilever was filled with
the Milli-Q water by applying an overpressure. Individual pick-ups
were performed by approaching a cell with the cantilever at 1 μm/s,
maintaining +20 mbar overpressure, and stopping for 10 s when a 5%
deflection in the photodetector voltage was detected due to the bending
of the cantilever when making contact with the cell. At this point,
the cantilever was kept static for 10 s, enough time to apply an underpressure
of −800 mbar after which it was retracted with a velocity of
1 μm/s. As the cantilever is retracted, it bends downward since
the cell is still adhered to the surface with a certain force. Once
the force required to bend the cantilever exceeds the maximum cell-adhesion
force, a rupture event occurs, causing the cell to be detached from
the surface and the cantilever to return to its original shape.

All experiments were performed at 37 °C in a humidified 5%
CO2 atmosphere.

Between every adhesion force measurement,
the measurement chamber
was replaced with the cleaning chambers with sodium hypochlorite and
Milli-Q water. The cantilever was cleaned by first dipping it in 5%
sodium hypochlorite and then thrice in pure Milli-Q water. This prevented
the cantilever from accumulating extracellular matrix and allowed
to use it repeatedly over the course of many days. Including the cleaning
procedure, up to 6 cells could be measured per hour. Between the experiments,
the cantilevers were stored in a Milli-Q water supplemented with 2%
of antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific AG, Switzerland)

Immunocytochemistry
Cells grown on substrates were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed 3× in PBS, permeabilized
in 0.5% Triton X-100 (TX) for 10 min, and blocked with 0.1% TX and
5% bovine serum albumin (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature (RT).
Incubation of 1:100 monoclonal vinculin-FITC and 1:100 phalloidin
568 was done for 1 h at RT in PBST, followed by washing 2× in
PBST and incubation 1:1000 with DAPI for 10 min at RT in PBS. Cells
were rinsed twice in PBS and imaged using an inverted fluorescent
microscope with corresponding excitation and emission filters (Olympus,
1X71, Melville NY, USA).
