Facile
methods toward strain-tolerant graphene-based electronic
components remain scarce. Although being frequently used to disperse
low-dimensional carbonaceous materials, ultrasonication (US) has never
been reliable for fabricating stretchable carbonaceous nanocomposite
(SCNC). Inspired by the unusual sonochemical assembly between graphene
oxide (GO) and carbon nanotube (CNT), we verified the roots-like GO–CNT
covalent bonding, rather than just π–π conjugation,
was formed during US. In addition, the shockwave-induced collision
in the binary-component system enables a burst of fragmentation at
the early stage, spatially homogeneous hybridization, and time-dependent
restoration of graphitic domains. All of the above are distinct from
extensive fragmentation of a conventional single-component system
and π–π conjugative assembly. The optimized SCNC
exhibits conductivity comparable to reduced monolayer GO and outperforms
π–π assemblies in retaining electrical conductance
at a strain of 160%—among one of the best reported stretchable
conductors. Raman analysis and mechanics simulation confirm the dominant
role of counterweighing between the intrinsic and external strains
on the mechano-response and durability of SCNC. This work suggests
the guideline of creating multiple-component sonochemical systems
for various functional nanocomposites.

==== Body
The rapid development of the
stretchable electronics inspired the pursuit of strain-tolerant conductive
components that retain the integrity of structure and conductivity
even under large strains.1,2 Two-dimensional (2D)
graphene has been reckoned as a highly promising candidate due to
its intrinsic tensile strength (130 GPa), flexibility, low resistivity
(10–6 Ω·cm) and negative Poisson’s
ratio when the tensile strain exceeds 6%.3,4 Disappointingly,
the overall conductivity of most reported graphene sheets is retained
at less than 5% strain due to brittle fracture at unavoidable defect
or strain-induced inhomogeneity of charge carriers mobility.5−8 To enhance the strain tolerance, the monatomic graphene has been
geometrically engineered into the mechano-responsive patterns, such
as crumple9,10 and kirigami.11 Meanwhile, the assembly between 2D graphene and its deformed states
(scrolls12,13 and crumpled ball14) or carbon allotropes15 provide scalable
alternatives. However, the critically high concentration of additives
induces the strong dependence of stretchability on the tricky preparative
methods and the nature of additives. So far, a facile and easier-handling
method to fabricate graphene-based components with high strain tolerance
is rarely reported.

Ultrasonication (US), among the strategies
of instantaneous energy
input,16,17 is a versatile wet method to disperse and
produce graphene-based carbon nanomaterials.18−20 It is also
kinetically complicated due to the intertwined processes, including
dispersion/exfoliation or reaggregation, damage, or restoration of
crystal structure and radical generation or recombination. Categorically,
the vast majority of researchers believe the shockwave-induced π–π conjugation and lamellar spacing
between graphitic domains dominates the superior stretchability and
mechanical stability of nanocomposites to their parent materials.15 Nevertheless, few examples exist to argue this
overtrusted claim in the context that the collisions among suspended
solid particles arise during extreme heating at the point of impact
to overcome the bonding energy barrier.21,22 In a single-component
system—graphene oxide (GO)23 or
carbon nanotube (CNT)24 dispersion as a
typical model—extensive sonication intensifies the fragmentation
and structural damage, while in binary- or even multiple-component
systems, the understandings of kinetics in bond cleavage, generation
of active intermediates and high-velocity heterogeneous collision
for bond formation/local fusion are quite vague.25

In this work, we carefully distinguish the unusual
sonochemical
phenomena of a well-known GO–CNT binary system from common
concepts of π–π conjugation and
fragmentation and thereby reintroduce US as a reliable method to fabricate
a strain-tolerant nanocomposite. Notably, we highlight three critical
findings. First, US enables roots-like covalent bonding between GO
and CNT, which was only realized before via chemical
vapor deposition (CVD). Second, we reveal (1) shockwave-induced collision
between pristine GO (p-GO) and CNT (0.05 equiv) occurs at the early
stage, and the resulting reductant fragments immediately help with
restoration of graphitic domains, which is distinct from (2) π–π
conjugative assembly (GO + CNT) and (3) kinetically different from
single-component sonication systems (GO-n, CNT-n) (Figure 1a). Third, covalently bonded CNT induces or retains in-plane compressive
stress of crumpled GO sheets, leading to stretchable carbonaceous
nanocomposites (SCNC-n, where n is
sonication minutes). The mechano-responsive pattern outperforms π–π
assemblies in retaining electrical conductance and structural integrity
even at a strain of 160%.

Figure 1 US-assisted formation of GO–CNT covalent
bonds. (a) Schematic
representation shows the formation procedure of (1) SCNC-n, (2) GO + CNT, and (3) GO-n. The shockwave-induced
collision between p-GO and CNT occurs at the earlier stage, which
is followed by restoration of graphitic domains. GO + CNT features
with π–π interactions and GO-n undergo gradual fragmentation, yielding CO2 much later.

Results and Discussion
Roots-like
Covalent Bonding
The additive-free water
over organic solvent is employed as sonication medium because water
is (1) a well-reported background and versatile reagent in chemical
reactions on GO surface,26,27 (2) minimization of
heteroatomic doping,28 and (3) the possibility
for environmental-friendly and scalable production. Exclusively for
SCNC-n, the pH value increases from 2 to 4–5,
and concurrently, the zeta-potential decreases from −12.5 to
−8.8 mV. The estimated bandgap energy from light extinction
is minimized at SCNC-15 (∼3.5 eV), while GO-15 and GO + CNT
change little in comparison with p-GO (∼4.35 eV). Wide-scan
survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further showed a much
higher C/O atomic ratio of SCNC-15 (4.9) than p-GO (2.2), GO-15 (2.0),
and GO + CNT (2.6), suggesting a notable removal of oxygen-containing
groups during US (Table S1 and Figures S1 and S2). All of the above preliminary
results strongly indicate that ultrasound plays a role not only in
breaking up the entanglement and guiding conjugative assembly19,29 but also in enabling mechanochemical reactions yet to be clarified.

TEM images of SCNC-15 (Figure 1b) reveal three configurations of the anchoring CNTs,
including single concentric root (I), two or multiple roots per CNT
(II), and multiple roots belonging to an entanglement (III). A statistic
of CNTs (and entanglement) presents an averaged frequency of appearance
of I, II, and III, which is approximately 24%, 35%, and 12%. The proportion
ratio of I and II varies in each experiment, but III can be reproducibly
minimized to zero until SCNC-30. The magnified images (Figure 1c) unveil that the outermost
layers of CNT roots are disrupted and gradually merged with GO planes.
These distorted carbon lattices imply the out-of-plane bonding region,
which is similar to the pillared graphene/CNT junctions induced by
CVD.25,30−35 In addition, we approved the robustness of our roots-like covalent
bonding over the π–π interactions
that could also expose the open ends of CNTs (see Figures S3–S6).

We also exclude the possibility
that I, II, and III are the free
open ends of unzipped CNT with sidewalls melded onto GO.36 Shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SHINERS)37 of GO-15 is featureless, and
a CNT-15 or CNT-15 + GO-15 physical mixture shows three companion
modes at around 1170, 1255, and 1450 cm–1 which
are assigned to the vibration mode of transpolyacetylene-like chains
at the open concentric edges of CNTs38−40 (see the Methods and Figure 2a). However, such modes are negligible for SCNC-15. Instead,
SCNC-15 is featured with a mode at 1530 cm–1 which
refers to C(sp3)–aryl bonds or five- and seven-membered
carbon rings in the regions with high local curvature.41 This result further supports the previous suggestion
based on our TEM observations.

Figure 2 Analysis of Raman spectra. (a) SHINERS
on SCNC-15, GO-15, CNT-15,
and GO-15+CNT-15. Normal Raman spectrum consists of three peaks: D
band (∼1350 cm–1), G band (∼1583 cm–1), and D′-bands (∼1620 cm–1). (b) ΓGversus ωG recorded on spots on regions of p-GO (black), CNT (orange), GO-15
(dark cyan), GO + CNT (blue), and SCNC-15 (red). (c) MAD and ID/IG as functions
of sonication time for SCNC-n.

Sonochemical Assembly
We then carried out of spatially
resolved Raman analysis to set SCNC apart from π–π assembly. Figures 2b and S7 show the spectra of p-GO (black)
differentiate CNT (orange) with the lower frequency of the G band
(ωG) and wider full width at half-maximum (fwhm,
here ΓG). The difference among GO-15 (cyan), SCNC-15
(red), and GO + CNT (red) becomes evident when we compare the mean
absolute deviation (MAD) of points of each sample (see the Methods). The MAD order is p-GO ≈ GO-15 (0.47)
< SCNC-15 (0.86) < GO + CNT (2.35) ≈ CNT. Even though
SCNC-15 and GO + CNT are analogous at a micron level (Figure S8), the comparison of MAD can be a potential
spectral methodology to differentiate much more homogeneous sonochemical
hybridization from the conjugative assembly.

Parallel to MAD,
we take the averaged D/G intensity ratio (ID/IG) reflecting variations in defective
and graphitic domains of SCNC-n.42 An identical temporal-dependent process was found: both
MAD and ID/IG decrease sharply at the initial 5 min and reach the lowest value
at between SCNC-10 and 15. ID/IG of SCNC-15 is even lower than GO-15 (1.32),
GO + CNT (1.21), p-GO (1.20), and CNT (1.19) (Figure 2C and Figure S9). Thus, the US-induced assembly accompanies the restoration of sp2 carbon networks, rather than only conjugative adhesion of
CNT. These coupled processes enable us to clarify the mechanism behind
US-induced hybridization by interpreting the restoration of graphitic
domains in SCNC-n.

Deconvoluted XPS C 1s spectra
of SCNC-15 unveil ∼10 atom
% increase for both sp2- and sp3-hybridized
carbon compared with p-GO and GO-15. Elimination of C–O–C
and O–C=O contributes to the major diminishment of oxygen,
but C–OH surprisingly increases from 4.8 to 19.6 atom % (Figure 3a). Furthermore,
FTIR temporal analysis of SCNC-n even illustrates
that the overall evolution of oxygen-containing groups achieves equilibrium
in only 1 min, leaving more stable hydroxyl and ether groups (see Figure S10). It first rules out the role of ultrasonic
thermal deoxygenation that removes −OH by instantaneous hot
spot or local thermal annealing.43−45 The main origin of −OH
is deemed to be nucleophilic attack of H2O to surface vacancies
and edge dangling bonds generated right after bond cleavage or decarboxylation
in the aqueous medium.46 Meanwhile, sonolysis
of water primarily produces reactive hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals
(H2O → •H + •OH),28 and −OH groups can consume
oxidative radicals (•OH) to prevent the radicals’
recombination or produce •H (•OH + OH = H2O + •H).46 The variation of •˙H radicals,
therefore, illustrates the evolution of −OH-loaded moieties.
We conduct the DPPH assay to quantify the H-donator (see the Supporting Information, Figure 3b, and Figure S11). As expected, SCNC-n notably quenches the DPPH
absorbance (at 516 nm) faster than GO-n or CNT-n from the beginning of sonication to the end. The H-donator
reaches the highest concentration at the first 2.5 min under US, which
represents the early increase of −OH groups and also coincides
with the considerable decrease of ID/IG from SCNC-1 (1.52) to SCNC-5 (1.27).

Figure 3 Clarification
of the mechanism of US-assisted assembly of GO and
CNT. (a) XPS C 1s spectra of p-GO, GO-15, and SCNC-15 reveal a dramatic
difference in evolution of functional groups. (b) Remaining DPPH after
reaction with each sonicated mixture was checked. System of SCNC-n quenches the characteristic absorption more than that
of water, GO-n, and CNT-n during
the whole sonication process, with the absorption of p-GO as reference.
(c) MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of small-molecular fragments of SCNC-15
containing some of reported (⧫) flavonoid antioxidant. (d)
Detection of CO2 during the ultrasonication unveiled that
the deoxygenation in SCNC-n system is faster and
less severe than that of GO-n.

We indeed found −OH-containing fragments, small (0–4k
Da) and large (5–50k Da), absorbed on the surface of SCNC-15
by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Figure 3c even shows some recognized fragments of
flavonoid-type molecules, mainly derived from the stepwise loss of
CO/CO2, at m/z 241, 213,
197, and 181 (Figure S12).47 Note that all of the adsorbates can be washed away with
isopropyl alcohol or acetonitrile, confirming their noncovalent connections
with SCNC-n surface. The generation of CO2 as a final product of deoxygenation was tracked to confirm the proposed
mechanism (see the Methods, Figure 3d, and Figure S13). We found SCNC-n increased, maximized,
and ceased the CO2 concentration in carrier flow just before
15 min sonication (30 min with 5 s on and 5 s off), whereas GO-n exhibited a much lagged but massive CO2 production.
The kinetics of CO2 production of SCNC-n matches the 5 min window we found for the optimization of MAD and ID/IG.

As such,
a convincing explanation of the restoration of graphitic
domains is that the shockwaves arise to high-velocity GO–CNT
collisions, inducing GO–CNT covalent bonds and fast generation
of fragments (Figure 1a). CNT is more likely to be rooted at the edge or a defective basal
plane of GO at the initial stage of collision, as we found in SCNC-5
(Figure S14) and other work.19 The free fragments increase in a short time
but decrease gradually as less probability of GO–CNT collision.
The initial fragments continue alternatively to interact with •OH and further fragment, yielding carbonyls or carboxylates
for deoxygenation and more stable hydroxyl/ether loading fragments.46 In the presence of •OH and
H2O, carbonyls and carboxylates will be easily converted
into gaseous CO/CO2 or dissolved H2CO3 to increase the pH of the system. The unpaired electrons lead to
the formation of covalent bonds with H2O or other carbon
atoms.48 Unlike gradually fragmented GO-n, the burst increase of surface-absorbed fragments at the
initial stage of sonication protects SCNC-n from
intensive fracture, leading to flakes twice the size of GO-n (Table S1). When the fragments
are used up, SCNC-30 increases MAD and ID/IG (Figure 2c). Without initial collision and fragmentation,
GO + CNT under US for extra 15 min keeps MAD unchanged, but ID/IG increases from
1.21 to 1.31. Furthermore, MALDI-TOF MS detected a similar fragmentation
when GO and fullerene were cosonicated (Figure S15), implying that the mechanism of collision can also be
applied to other binary-component systems. We also find that excess
fullerene proportion intensifies the collision frequency and degrades
the MAD and ID/IG, reflecting the possible detrimental effect of collision
(Figure S16). In addition, we also discussed
the size and dimension of the secondary carbonaceous component (see
the Supporting Information and Figure S17). We found the large 3D objects weakened
the collision,21,22 while a 2D partner led to a homogeneous
assembly mainly by π–π conjugation or hydrophobic
attraction.

Strain-Tolerant Structural Integrity and
Conductance
Morphologically, the crumples and rooting CNTs
are densely observed
on SCNC-15 (Figure 4a). It is difficult to decouple the effects of rooting CNTs and heterogeneous
atomic hybridization of sp2 networks to the out-of-plane
deformation.49,50 The rooting CNTs indeed retain
the crumples against 2D capillary-force stretching during drying on
a substrate, whereas p-GO, GO-n, and GO + CNT are
flattened easily (Figure S18). The mechano-response
becomes notable as the tensile strain increases to 40% uniaxially.
The regular ridges along the stretching direction can be identified
(Figure 4b). Until
the strain reaches 120%, all nanotubes were extensively stretched
and merged with the ridges and, if present, grooves (Figure 4c). The ridges tend to align
along the tensile direction with a roughly averaged distance of 300
nm, although they are slightly distracted locally by the innate stress.
Our parallel simulations reveal the configurations II and III of rooting
CNTs can induce in-plane expansion of the SCNC-15, which is in turn
constrained by the substrate, engendering compressive stresses in
SCNC-15. When the SCNC-15 substrate is stretched, the nanotubes are
extended along the tensile direction, and in turn, the stresses between
CNTs and GO also distribute along the tensile direction (insets of Figure 4a–c, see the Supporting Information). The variation from labyrinthine
crumpling to a groove pattern with the magnificence of strain is consistent
with our SEM observation.

Figure 4 Strain-tolerant electrical conductance and structural
integrity.
(a–c) SEM images of SCNC-15 flakes deposited on a PDMS substrate
which was stretched by a precise vice at strain of 0, 40, and 120%,
respectively (scale bar 1 μm). Insets are snapshots of an ideal
2D flake which was simulated to be isometrically compressed into irregular
wrinkles, stretched uniaxially and fully stretched. (d) ΓG and ωG of SCNC-15 as functions of strain
are shown, along with the variations at 20th and 50th stretch. (e)
Upon being stretched at transverse (red), longitudinal (dark cyan),
and diagonal (orange) directions, the resistance of SCNC-15 in each
case shows the initial decrease before the strain of 80% and slight
increase until 160%. The inset shows the schematic of our strain-conductivity
measurement setup, with flakes bridging two Pt electrodes, across
which the scanning voltage from −0.4 to 0.4 V was applied.
(f) Gauge factors of different stretchable carbonaceous materials/elastomer
composites as functions of strain are shown. Graphene is referred
to as Gr.

Spectrally, the stretched SCNC-15
shows ∼3 cm–1 blueshifts of ωG and 10 cm–1 ΓG narrowings of
G peak below 40% strain, followed by the stress-induced
redshifts of ωG (by ∼2 cm–1) and increases of ΓG (by ∼4 cm–1) at the strain of 120%.51,52 Such “relax-stress”
alteration of SCNC-15 generally maintains good reproducibility when
the substrate is repeatedly stretched to the 80% strain and back (Figure 4d). In comparison,
the conventional 2D flakes usually undergo an opposite “stress-relax”
or even cracking process under tensile strain,53 and so we found for p-GO, GO-15, and GO + CNT (Figure S19–S21). Inspired by the Raman
“relax-stress” alteration of SCNC-15 and strong electron–phonon
coupling of graphene-based materials,54 we deduce that stress-induced variations of electronic structure
can be relieved by counterweighing between the intrinsic and external
strains.

Without any reduction, the electrical conductivity
of SCNC-15 flakes
is estimated at a range of 0.46–1.84 × 104 S/m,
already approaching the record of reduced GO monolayer (2.0 ×
104 S/m)55 (see the Methods and Figure S22). When the strain is below 80%, the resistance (R) remains almost unchanged (ΔR = R – R0 ≈ 0, R0 defined as
the resistance without strain) at transverse, longitudinal, and diagonal
directions (Figure 4e). It indicates that the multidirectional rooting CNTs maintain
an efficient connection across SCNC-15 to overcome the transport barriers.
Beyond bridging the sheets, the rooting CNTs restore the structural
integrity of SCNC-15 even at a strain of 160% (Figure S23). It is in contrast to the conventional pillared
structures that undermine the overall tensile strength because of
localized high stress concentration.56 The
propagation of microcracks is ceased, as evidenced by the fact that
the resistance of SCNC-15 remains almost intact while GO + CNT has
a 50000-fold increase (Figure S24). The
strain tolerance was evaluated by comparing the gauge factor (defined
by ΔR/(R × strain)) of
SCNC-15 with the existing stretchable nanocarbonaceous composites.
Regarding the gauge factor (0.06) and strain durability (0–160%),
the single-layer SCNC-15 is analogous to the best-performing crumbled
graphene10 and graphene scroll hybrid12 (Figure 4f and Table S2). These properties
make SCNC-15 particularly suitable for flexible electronic devices.

Conclusions
To summarize, we confirm that US induces roots-like
covalent bonds
by carefully distinguishing the GO–CNT binary-component system
from the single ones and the pairs dominated by π–π
conjugative assembly. The US-directed assembly was systematically
tracked to produce nanocomposites whose electrical conductance resists
high external strain by its mechano-responsive crumbled structure.
The rooting morphologies of CNTs reflect the covalent bonding formed
by shockwave-mediated collisions between GO and CNT. Adopting the
collision strategy can not only guide the formation of all-carbon
composites but also provides an approach to understand the concurrence
of restoration of sp2 networks and homogeneous assembly
in the binary-component sonication systems between GO and Au, Ag,
Pt, Pd, ZnO, TiO2, and CuO nanoparticles.43

Although we confirmed the covalent bonding and securitized
the
role of US in making stretchable composites, it is unclear yet how
the fragments and rooting CNT affect the mechanical and electrical
properties of planar materials. To address this problem, we are trying
to couple the PeakForce with the conductive AFM techniques. To fundamentally
understand the process of collision between carbon materials (0.1–100
km/s),57−59 the dependence of collision velocity on the size
and dimensions need to be quantified. Our current sonication model
only partially explains these results. Determination of the exact
mechanism and precise tailoring collision kinetics for desired performance
will be the focus of future work.

Material
and Methods
Fabrication of SCNC-n and CO2 Sensing
We conducted US protected by argon within a Suslick cell to discount
the disruptive reactions (Figure S13).
Before use, all of the GO solution (2 mg/mL), multiwalled CNT (O.D.
× L, 6–13 nm × 2.5–20 μm),
and fullerene from Sigma-Aldrich were washed with IPA three times.
The washed GO was redispersed in water. CNT and C60 solids were dried
under vacuum. The mixture of 8 mL of GO aqueous solution (2 mg/mL,
pH = 2) and 0.8 mg of CNT was pulse-sonicated (model FB705, 20 kHz,
Power 700 W, Fisher Scientific, USA) for a certain time (amplitude:
40%, 5 s on and 5 s off) with a titanium microtip probe (1/8 in.)
in the Suslick reaction cell (cooled by 4 °C circulating water).
Then the power density at probe surface was calculated to be around
216 W/cm2. Sonication of GO/C60, GO, or CNT followed the
same procedure. SprintIR-W high-speed CO2 sensor with a
flow adapter was connected to the gas outlet of Suslick cell. The
sensor takes record 20/s. Here, we controlled the argon rate as 3–4
bubbles/second.

Raman Analysis
For SHINERS, Reinshaw
50LWD objective
was used. The excitation wavelength was 637.8 nm from a He–Ne
laser (power is about 1 mW). Raman frequencies were calibrated using
Si wafer spectra. The Raman spectra shown in the experiment were collected
during 60 s for one single spectrum curve one time. Arrays of 55 nm
gold nanoparticle with 3–4 nm silica shell covered the sample
surface which was rinsed by IPA before gold coverage. Raman mapping
and spectra were acquired with a LabRam Xplora confocal Raman microscope
equipped with a confocal microscope and a motorized x–y–z stage. Measurements
were conducted with 50× long working distance objective lens,
and a linear polarized laser (λ = 532 nm) excitation was focused
with a diffraction-limited spot size (theoretical 1.22λ/NA)
on samples. The Raman signal was detected with a grating 1800 grooves
mm–1, along with a 1% filter, 200 μm slit,
and 500 μm hole. For mapping, 1 μm steps were chosen,
and every pixel corresponds to one scan. The spectrum from each location
was obtained by averaging 3 s cycles. We characterized each Raman
peak (G, D, and D′) by Lorentzian fit, and we fit those peaks
together using a double-Lorentzian fit. The mean absolute deviation
(MAD) of a data set is the average distance between each data value
and the mean. The mean absolute deviation describes variation in a
data set. The MAD of a set {ωG1, ΓG1; ωG2, ΓG2; ωG3, ΓG3; ...; ωGn, ΓGn} is  where  and are the mean value of ωG and ΓG, respectively.

Stretchability
and Conductivity
The casting solution
was prepared by diluting the dispersion 25 times with deionized water.
A 50 μL portion of the solution was cast onto a flat glass or
an elastic PDMS substrate, which was dried under vacuum overnight.
Then, two Pt electrodes with a thickness of 60 nm were deposited as
the metal contacts on flakes via a shadow mask by
radiofrequency sputtering using a Moorfield nanoPVD-S10A system at
45 W, 3 × 10–4 mbar in pure Argon. The gap
spacing between two Pt electrodes was 20 μm. Elastic PDMS substrates
were prepared by spin-coating Sylgard 184 on a clean silicon wafer.
The films were then cured at 100 °C for 3 h and peeled off (0.5
mm in thickness). The method to measure the resistance of a sample
is the two-probe technique that consists of contacting two probes
and measuring the voltage while a current is applied between the probes.
The samples were fixed to the surface of small vice clamp with superglue.
The strain was applied by turning the knob of vice. Repeatability
characteristics have been performed by the handle control mechanism.
The strain of PDMS was determined by two reference dots close to the
measured flake samples. Unless otherwise stated, all of the strains
mentioned in this work are determined by the reference dots on PDMS.

MALDI-TOF MS Analysis
The original 2 mg/mL dispersion
was first diluted to 0.5 mg/mL with water and then mixed in methanol
for 50% v/v. After being shaken for 1 min, 2.5 μL of the suspension
was pipetted onto the MTP 384 ground steel target. The sample target
was left at room temperature for 10–15 min for evaporation
of the solvent. For washed SCNC-15, the original dispersion was added
to 2-propanol (1:10) to form a flocculent suspension. After centrifugation
at 8000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet
was washed with IPA two more times and then dispersed in water. The
autoflex maX MALDI-TOF MS system (Bruker) was utilized with the mass-to-charge
ratio (m/z) range of 0–4k
and 5–50k Da. The methods of RP for low mass range and LP Da
for medium mass range were chosen. Fifty shots at raster spot, 10000
shots, frequency of 2000, and intensity of 55% were adopted for measurement.
Raw mass spectra were exported as text files (.txt) using flexAnalysis
software. All subsequent data analyses were conducted with methods
of 0–3.5k Da and 5–20k Da for spectral pattern matching.
Peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least three were extracted
from each spectrum after baseline correction and intensity normalization.
