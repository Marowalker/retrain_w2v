Low-cost,
robust, and reusable continuous glucose monitoring systems
that can provide quantitative measurements at point-of-care settings
is an unmet medical need. Optical glucose sensors require complex
and time-consuming fabrication processes, and their readouts are not
practical for quantitative analyses. Here, a wearable contact lens
optical sensor was created for the continuous quantification of glucose
at physiological conditions, simplifying the fabrication process and
facilitating smartphone readouts. A photonic microstructure having
a periodicity of 1.6 μm was printed on a glucose-selective hydrogel
film functionalized with phenylboronic acid. Upon binding with glucose,
the microstructure volume swelled, which modulated the periodicity
constant. The resulting change in the Bragg diffraction modulated
the space between zero- and first-order spots. A correlation was established
between the periodicity constant and glucose concentration within
0–50 mM. The sensitivity of the sensor was 12 nm mM–1, and the saturation response time was less than 30 min. The sensor
was integrated with commercial contact lenses and utilized for continuous
glucose monitoring using smartphone camera readouts. The reflected
power of the first-order diffraction was measured via a smartphone application and correlated to the glucose concentrations.
A short response time of 3 s and a saturation time of 4 min was achieved
in the continuous monitoring mode. Glucose-sensitive photonic microstructures
may have applications in point-of-care continuous monitoring devices
and diagnostics at home settings.

Diabetes
is a significant global
health challenge caused by either a deficiency or resistance to insulin.1 This epidemic affecting more than 382 million
people is on the rise worldwide.2 Diabetes
has an annual cost burden of $245 billion ($176 billion in direct
expenses) for the United States healthcare system.3 Diabetes as a chronic illness requires constant monitoring
of blood glucose concentration to manage insulin administration.4,5 Fluctuations in the concentration of glucose in blood may result
in diabetic ketoacidosis that can lead to a seizure.6 Long-term complications of diabetes include neuropathy,
cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and limb amputation.7

The concentration of glucose is typically
monitored by using fingerstick
blood samples.8 Patients on multiple-dose
insulin injection or insulin pump therapy should measure their blood
glucose concentration 6–8 times a day. However, the test is
performed more infrequently due to the pain and inconvenience associated
with fingersticks, particularly among children with type 1 diabetes.9,10 Another strategy is to use subcutaneously inserted electrochemical
sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems (e.g., Dexcom, Medtronic).11,12 These devices aim to provide
real-time, long-term measurements that can also be used with insulin
pumps to form an automated feedback loop to manage insulin delivery
when hypo/hyperglycemia is developing.13−15 The primary application
of these CGM devices is in type 1 diabetic patients. CGM systems also
help prediabetic and type 2 diabetic patients to self-regulate their
exercise and achieve effective intervention programs and to optimize
an insulin regimen.16−18 Commercial CGM systems, however, do not completely
provide a solution for uncontrolled glycemic fluctuations due to low
patient compliance. Calibration of CGM systems requires at least 3–4
fingerstick blood tests per day.19 These
devices are subject to signal drift due to electrochemical reaction
instability, resulting in time lags and sensor replacement every 3–7
days.20 Therefore, the development of minimally
invasive continuous monitoring systems that can accurately measure
the blood glucose concentration for long periods without frequent
calibration and replacement is an unmet need in diabetes care.

To overcome the instability issues with electrochemical sensors,
alternative approaches involving phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives
and optical sensors have emerged. Functionalizing a hydrogel with
PBA that exhibits affinity to diol-containing molecules can be exploited
for continuous monitoring of glucose. Binding of PBA with glucose
reversibly alters the volume of the hydrogel matrix.21−23 This mechanism of volumetric changes in glucose-selective hydrogels
has motivated the investigation of glucose sensors. For example, hydrogels
containing 3D crystalline colloidal arrays (CCAs) have been synthesized
and functionalized with PBA after polymerization.24−26 The periodicity
of the dielectric 3D photonic crystal (PC) embedded in hydrogel acts
as a wavelength filter and diffracts specific wavelengths according
to Bragg’s law. Thereby, any volumetric change because of variation
in glucose concentration can be sensed as Bragg peak shifts. Recent
studies focused on improving the selectivity, sensitivity, and response
time of the inverse opal 3D PC hydrogels functionalized with PBA for
glucose sensing.22,27−30 Nevertheless, the preparation
of a 3D PC has stringent constraints; their fabrication is complex
(monodispersed, highly charged microparticles), time-consuming (e.g., ion depletion, dialysis), and requires considerable
optimization to realize the required lattice order.31 Recently, a hydrogel-based 2D CCA monolayer sensor was
demonstrated.32,33 The volumetric changes of the
hydrogel upon binding with glucose in 2D CCA sensors are based on
the detection of the particle interspace variation that leads to a
change in diffraction wavelength. Although fabrication of a 2D PC
sensor is relatively less time-consuming compared to 3D PCs, it still
requires a well-ordered monolayer of particles, optimization not to
disrupt the array, and postpolymerization functionalization with PBA.
Based on glucose-induced hydrogel volume modulation, reflection hologram-based
sensors have also been realized.34,35 These sensors
are sensitive to glucose but require a sophisticated fabrication technique
based on continuous or pulsed laser recording. The complications in
fabricating photonic crystal sensors hinder their way to mass production
at low cost. Additionally, it remains a challenge to obtain visual
quantitative readouts.

Here, a photonic microstructure-based
sensor is developed via a facile stamping method
on the surface of glucose-sensitive
hydrogel networks. As a free-standing sensor, the volumetric changes
of the hydrogel in response to the variation glucose concentration
modulate the periodic constant of the microstructure, changing the
diffraction angle and the zero/first-order interspacing for the diffracted
monochromatic light in transmission mode. The sensor was also attached
to the surface of a commercial contact lens, and a smartphone application
was utilized to record the reflection power of the first-order diffracted
light. The groove depth of the constrained sensor on the contact lens
surface increased with glucose complexation, leading to a change in
diffraction efficiency. This sensor offers advantages in terms of
fast and facile preparation, swift response at low glucose concentrations,
and simple readouts within physiological conditions.

Results and Discussion
The photonic structure (PS) was replicated on a hydrogel matrix
during the UV curing process (Figure 1a). Surface characterization has confirmed successful
replication of the 1D master PS on the hydrogel film as probed by
an optical microscope (Figure 1b). Optical microscopy images revealed that the replicated
structure on the hydrogel matrix was intact and well ordered. Photographs
of the master PS and the prepared PS hydrogel sensor exhibited comparable
diffraction colors and showed a complete visible spectrum (Figure 1c). The diffraction
of broadband light in transmission mode by the PS hydrogel sensor
produced visible colors (rainbow), as displayed on a screen (Figure 1c). Figure 1d shows the schematic of the
setup for the transmission mode diffraction experiment. The setup
was fixed on an optical bench and consisted of a 3D translation stage
for controlling the position of the sample, and the broadband light
source was used to illuminate the sample and to project a transmitted
diffraction pattern on a screen.

The diffraction of monochromatic
blue (405 nm), green (532 nm),
and red (650 nm) laser light by the PS sensor in transmission mode
was studied in 40% relative humidity and fully hydrated conditions
(equilibration in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution) to record
the swelling effect in terms of the change in diffraction pattern.
When the sensor was illuminated at normal incidence, the diffracted
light on the screen perpendicularly placed to the laser beam was observed
in the form of a 1D interference fringe array. Photographs of the
diffraction patterns for the three laser wavelengths were captured
from a fixed distance to the imaging screen, and zero/first-order
interspace (l), diffraction angles (θd), and diffraction efficiency were measured using the ImageJ program
(Figure 2). The linear
array of diffracted light from the 1D PS sensor obeyed the transmission
grating formula, mλ = d(sin
θi – sin θd), where m is an integer, λ is the diffraction wavelength, d is the periodic constant or groove constant, and θi and θd are the incidence and diffraction
angles, respectively. In the experimental configuration, the transmission
diffraction angle, θd, can be obtained from the relationship,
θd = tan–1 lh–1, where h is the distance between
the PS sensor and the imaging screen. The volumetric changes in PS
sensor affected the periodicity constant, which subsequently altered
the zero/first-order interspace. Conversely, change in periodic constant
(Δd) and the diffraction angle (Δθd) could be determined by measuring the interspace between
zero- and first-order fringes, and this principle allowed the measurements
of the glucose concentration.

and imprinted hydrogel surfaces in 40% relative humidity. (m,n) Schematic
diagrams and Fourier transform for the hydrogel sensor in 40% relative
humidity and fully hydrated (FH) conditions, respectively.

In 40% relative humidity conditions, θd and l for blue, green, and red beams were
larger compared to
their counterpart values in a fully hydrated case. The PS sensor swelled
upon immersion in PBS solution, increasing the periodicity constant
that decreased the diffraction angle, and consequently, the zero/first-order
interspace shrunk. That is, for the red, green, and blue beams, l shrunk from its pristine values of around 18, 16, and
14 cm to 15, 13, and 11 cm, respectively, and the diffraction angles
decreased from 23, 18, and 14° to 18, 14, and 11°, respectively.
The diffraction angle was wavelength-dependent, where the smallest
angle was for the blue light and the largest angle was for the red
light, as expected according to the grating formula. In fully hydrated
condition, the calculated values of θd and l using the grating formula were found to be consistent
with the measured values using the identical experiment parameters; d = 1.6 μm, θi = 0°, and λ
= 405, 532, and 650 nm. The absolute efficiency of the first order
for the PS sensor was wavelength-dependent, and it subtly decreased
in fully hydrated conditions. The highest diffraction efficiency was
measured in the case of the blue beam, which decreased with increased
illumination wavelength. In 40% relative humidity conditions, as d and θi are constants, and the absolute
efficiencies were recorded to be 0.030, 0.028, and 0.009% for blue,
green, and red laser beams, respectively. Thus, these results match
with the grating formula that states the absolute efficiency is dependent
upon the wavelength, incident angle, and the periodicity constant.36 The absolute efficiency of the PS sensor was
inversely proportional to the periodicity constant—the first-order
efficiencies in a fully hydrated condition for blue, green, and red
lasers were ∼0.027, 0.015, and 0.006%, which were less than
their counterparts in 40% relative humidity conditions.

Transmission
characteristics of the PS sensor were investigated
at different polarization angles (0–90°) to study the
swelling effect on the transmission properties and the sensor’s
response to polarized light in 40% relative humidity and fully hydrated
conditions. Figure 3a shows the schematic of the experimental setup for transmittance
measurements. Transmittance of the sensor in fully hydrated conditions
was higher than that in the 40% relative humidity case; this is due
to the swelling of the hydrogel which absorbs more water that leads
to a decrease of the refractive index and increases the periodic constant
that decreases the diffraction efficiency of the sensor. The trend
for transmission curves for all polarization angles remained similar
in 40% relative humidity and fully hydrated conditions—transmittance
increased gradually from shorter to longer wavelengths and decreased
systematically with polarization angles. This could also be explained
from the results in Figure 2, which showed that the diffraction efficiency for short wavelengths
(blue laser beam) was higher than that of longer wavelength laser
beams (green and red). The decrease of the transmission spectra over
all the wavelength ranges with polarization angle confirmed that the
PS sensor is insensitive to polarized light and exhibited no polarization
effects itself.

(f,g) Angle-resolved measurements of the diffracted light in the reflection

Angle-resolved diffraction measurements in reflection
mode for
the sensor in 40% relative humidity and fully hydrated conditions
were recorded to analyze the hydrogel swelling effect (Figure 3f,g). First-order diffraction
of the PS sensor in reflection mode was recorded using a spectrophotometer,
while the sensor was fixed horizontally on an aluminum mirror and
illuminated by a fiber-optic halogen light source. In 40% relative
humidity conditions, the detector was rotated 18° (20–38°),
to pick up the first-order diffraction rainbow of the 450–850
nm spectral range. However, for fully hydrated conditions, the same
spectral bandwidth was picked up by traversing the detector within
only 13° (20–33°), which is 5° less than that
in 40% relative humidity conditions. This was due to the expanding
periodic constant upon hydrogel swelling of the PS sensor that leads
to a decrease in the angular dispersion of PS and shrinks the spatially
separated rainbow.

Sensing was first carried out by investigating
the cross section
variation of the PS sensor in various glucose concentrations at 24
°C. The cross section dynamics of the hydrogel matrix were measured
under an optical microscope and correlated with glucose concentrations
(Figure 4d and Supporting Information Figure S1). Boronic acid
has a pKa ∼8.8, and at low pH values
(pH < pKa), PBA exists in an uncharged
trigonal planar configuration. When PBA interacts with cis-diol molecules, a cyclic ester is formed whose pKa is less than that of boronic acid and dissociates into
the hydrogen ion and the stable boronate anion (Figure 4b). At higher pH values in an aqueous solution
(pH > pKa), the trigonal form of PBA
dissociates,
donating a proton to form a boronate ion of tetrahedral configuration
that binds to cis-diol molecules (Figure 4b).37 PBA reversibly bind with diols in glucose, forming either a 1:1
complex or a 2:1 cross-linking complex. Glucose-induced PS sensor
swelling resulted from the anionic 1:1 complexation of boronate–glucose
in the hydrogel matrix that increased the boronate anions; subsequently,
the Donnan osmatic pressure increased to swell the hydrogel.38 The hydrogel swelling upon glucose binding occurs
not only across the cross section but also in-plane to the surface,
increasing the periodic constant (d). First, the
sensor was equilibrated in PBS solution (pH 7.4, ionic strength =
150 mM) for 2 h, then thickness measurements of the hydrogel cross
section were carried out after 60 min for each concentration. Glucose
concentrations (0–50 mM) in PBS solution with 10 mM increments
were presented to the PS and analyzed under an optical microscope
(Figure 4c). The sensor
swelled due to glucose binding, and the cross section linearly increased
with increasing concentrations. When the glucose concentration was
increased from 0 to 10 mM, the sensor’s cross section thickness
increased from an original value of 100 to 110 μm and reached
130 μm for 50 mM glucose concentration (Figure 4d).

section in various glucose concentrations. (d) Change in the sensor’s
cross section as a function of glucose concentration. The scale bars
show standard error (n = 3).

Diffraction experiments in transmission mode for the PS sensor
at physiological conditions were carried out to quantify glucose concentrations.
The setup used for the sensor readout consisted of an image screen
and a red laser pointer as a beam source. The glucose binding induced
swelling in the periodic constant (d), leading to
shrinkage of zero/first-order interspace (l), and
decreased the diffraction angle (θd). For low glucose
concentrations, the interspace (l) linearly decreased
from 20.2 to 18.3 cm, in response to an increase in glucose concentration
from 0 to 10 mM, when d increased from 1840 to 1968
nm with an overall 128 nm increase (Figure 5a,b). For high glucose concentrations from
10 to 50 mM, the sensor produced a linear response, and the periodic
constant increased by 180 nm to reach 2150 nm, shrinking the zero/first-order
interspace to 16.1 cm, a 2.1 cm decrease (Figure 5c,d). When the glucose concentration increased
to 100 mM, the periodic spacing increased to 2270 nm by a 120 nm shift.
The slope of the linear relation for the periodic constant versus the glucose concentration was 12 nm/mM in the low
glucose concentration range (0–10 mM), which was more than
double the slope of the linear relation (4.5 nm/mM) for the high glucose
concentration range (10–50 mM). This indicated that the sensor’s
sensitivity decreased above 10 mM, and this might be due to the decrease
in the elasticity of the hydrogel matrix by swelling.39 The sensor’s sensitivity decreased subtly with increasing
glucose concentrations and had nonlinear response above 50 mM (Figure 5g,h).

scale bars show standard error (n = 3).

The sensitivity of the sensor for glucose can be
given by the slope
of the linear correlation of the periodic constant versus the glucose concentration, , where
Δd is the
change in the periodicity constant and Δcon is the
change in glucose concentration. For low glucose concentrations (0–10
mM), which is the most significant range (human physiological range
such as in tears, urine, and blood), the sensitivity of the PS sensor
was ∼12.8 nm/mM, which resulted in a decrease of 3.7 mm between
the first-order spots, whereas the image screen was placed at 50 cm
away from the sensor. Within the range of 10–50 mM, the sensor’s
sensitivity decreased to ∼4.5 nm/mM, and this behavior agrees
with previously reported work.24,25,27,39 As 3PBA complexes with cis-diol molecules, both lactate and fructose, which are
present in the blood, were estimated to interfere by 5% in the sensor
readouts.40

It is well-known that
the constrained sensors that undergo volumetric
change in only one dimension (1D) upon glucose binding are more sensitive
compared to the free-standing systems.41 However, the free-standing 1D PS sensor swells isotropically in
3D, and it shows a significantly high response compared to the physically
constrained 3D crystalline colloidal array sensor. The 1D holographic
and polymerized crystalline colloidal array (PCCA)-based glucose sensors
exhibit 300 nm wavelength shift over a glucose range from 0 to 50
mM.27,34 The 1D PS sensor increased by 310 nm in
the periodicity constant for the same glucose concentration range.
Diffraction measurements from holographic and PCCA arrays are relatively
complex and require measurements in the dark to prevent ambient light
interference and a high-cost fiber-optic spectrophotometer.40 In contrast, readout and quantitative measurements
of the glucose concentration by the PS sensor only requires a screen
and a laser pointer, which renders this approach simple, low-cost,
and practical. When the sensitivity of the 1D PS sensor is compared
with the 2D sensors that are free-standing, the PS offers nearly double
their sensitiviy. For example, in 2D glucose sensors, particle spacing
shifted by 7 nm/mM glucose concentration in the range from 0 to 10
mM, but the periodic constant of the PS sensor shifted by 12 nm/mM.31 The higher sensitivity of the PS sensor compared
to that of the 2D array sensors can be attributed to the larger active
surface area of the PS sensor as the stamped photonic structure increases
the active surface area. In contrast, the existing 2D arrays compose
of unactive polysterene particles, which reduce the sensor’s
active area.

The swelling kinetics of the PS sensor upon glucose
binding has
been studied for low (2 mM) and high (10 mM) glucose concentrations.
The periodic constant change of the sensor was recorded every 5 min
for each concentration. The sensor exhibited rapid response to glucose
and reached complexation equilibrium in 25 and 20 min for low and
high glucose concentrations, respectively (Figure 6a,b). The low glucose concentration (2 mM)
had longer time to reach saturation (25 min), which agreed with the
previously reported work.40,42 In recent studies,
the saturation time for the 3PBA-modified PCCAs was 40 min for 10
mM glucose concentration, which was double the saturation time (20
min) for our sensor.27 Additionally, the
saturation time for 3PBA_holographic sensors was 120 min for low glucose
concentration and more than 50 min for high glucose concentrations.40 The rapid response for low and high glucose
concentrations is one of the advantageous characteristics of the PS
sensor that can be explained by increased active surface area by printing
the PS on the top of the responsive hydrogel matrix that improved
the glucose diffusion rate.

kinetics of the
sensor in PBS of 2 mM glucose, (b) 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4 and ionic
strength 150 mM). Scale bar = 10 cm. (c) Periodicity constant versus time for 10 mM glucose concentration during three
cycles as the sensor was reset for 10 s in pH 4.6 then 60 min in PBS
in each cycle.

To investigate the stability
and reusability of the sensor, the
response of the sensor during three cycles was recorded (Figure 6c). The sensor was
examined for 60 min and then reset by a buffer solution of pH 4.6
for 10 s and 60 min in PBS before the next cycle (Figure 6c). The periodic spacing swelled
to become 1905 ± 3 nm from its original value of 1840 nm in each
cycle, and by resetting, d shrinks to its pristine
value of around 1840 ± 3 nm each time without hysteresis.

Back-diffraction measurements were employed to confirm that the
PS sensor can sense glucose by this method, as well. The sensor was
placed at a horizontal mirror and illuminated by a broadband source
at 38° (Figure 7a). The back-diffracted light was collected by the spectrophotometer
fixed at a precision rotation stage. Figure 7b–f illustrates the experimental data
for diffracted light plotted against wavelength at various diffraction
angles for glucose concentrations from 10 to 50 mM. The whole spectra
at certain detection angles underwent a red shift (Figure 7g). This was in accordance
with the diffraction law, where diffracted spectra traversed a negative
displacement (i.e., decreasing angle) upon positive
increment in the periodic constant, which also supported angle-resolved
measurements carried out in the reflection mode. The diffracted wavelength
shifts from 470 to 504 nm upon glucose concentration from 10 to 50
mM.

mode. (a) Schematic of the setup used for measuring the diffraction
in the reflection mode. (b–f) Light diffraction versus wavelengths at various diffraction angles for the PS sensor in various

wavelength on the glucose concentration.

The utility of the glucose sensor was demonstrated in the
form
of a point-of-care wearable sensor; the sensor was attached to a commercial
contact lens, and the glucose concentration was measured by a smartphone
app (Figure 8a–c).
As shown in Figure 8b, the sensor exhibits a rainbow light effect on the contact lens
surface under normal room light conditions. For the constrained sensor
on the contact lens surface, the glucose concentration was monitored
by recording the reflected power of the first-order spot (P1). The constraint offered by the contact lens
does not allow the grating spacing to significantly change; however,
the groove depth of the sensor increases with glucose complexing,
leading to changes in the diffraction efficiency (P1/Po). The contact lens was
illuminated with a low power monochromatic light with a wavelength
of 532 nm, and the reflected power of the first-order spot was recorded
by a powermeter and a smartphone’s photodetector. Continuous
monitoring of the reflected power in response to glucose concentrations
(0–50 mM) was carried out (Figure 8d–g). As the contact lens was used
as the substrate platform for the sensor, this allowed us to cut down
the sensor thickness to around ∼2 μm, which offered a
fast response time of around 3 s, and reached an equilibrium state
in 12, 4, 4, 2, 2, and 1.5 min for glucose concentrations of 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, and 100 mM, respectively (Supporting Information Figure S2). The response and saturation times for
the contact-lens-based PS sensor are impressive compared to those
in a recently published report, where an equilibrium time of ∼20
min was recorded.38 The effect of the mechanical
strain on the output signal of the contact lens sensor was also studied
(Supporting Information Figure S3). The
contact lens with an integrated photonic sensor was exposed to an
extension force, and the change in the output signal was recorded
by an optical powermeter. The mechanical strain was monitored against
the reflected power in the first-order spot. A 2.2% change in the
mechanical strain affected the output signal by 3.0%. In the present
work, it was found that increasing the glucose concentration from
0 to 50 mM decreased the output power by ∼20% (1.31–1.05
μW). Therefore, a 2.2% change in the mechanical strain caused
13% interference in the output reading when the sensor monitored a
glucose concentration of 50 mM. This interference may increase at
lower glucose concentrations. For example, for 10 mM glucose concentration,
the interference is expected to be ∼40%. Therefore, the sensor
is not recommended for patients who suffer from eye diseases that
change the intraocular pressure. The PS glucose sensor attached to
the contact lens had advantages compared to the previously proposed
electrochemical and fluorescent glucose sensors attached to contact
lenses. The PS contact lens sensor was easy and quick to be fabricated,
and its readout does not require high-cost complex equipment. In addition,
the sensor was nontoxic and biocompatible. Moreover, the sensor cost
was reasonable, and it had a rapid response. On the contrary, the
electrochemical sensors attached to contact lenses are associated
with significant fabrication complexity. In 2014, Google announced
the development of a glucose monitoring contact lens; however, it
has not released the product yet. Their prototype was composed of
an electrochemical glucose sensor, antenna, power supply, and light-emitting
diode, and it is embedded between two layers of lens material. A significant
challenge of this electrochemical technology concerns the limitations
in miniaturization of electronics in contact lenses. Additionally,
the capability to transmit power and receive data from a contact lens
remains a hurdle. Furthermore, fluorescent sensors have many disadvantages,
such as hotobleaching, and the pH/oxygen of the environment can interfere
with the dye’s response. In addition, the potential toxicity
of the dyes and their potential accumulation in the cells is a major
safety concern. Moreover, the sensor’s materials are costly,
and the readout is complicated as it requires an expensive appliance
(spectrofluorometer) and a dedicated monochromatic light source.

Conclusion
A photonic structure
glucose sensor was developed and integrated
with a contact lens that operates within the physiological conditions
(pH 7.4, 150 mM ionic strength). The whole fabrication processes of
the PS sensor involving polymerization, functionalizing the hydrogel,
printing the PS, and attaching the sensor to the contact lens were
carried out in one step, requiring a short time of nearly 5 min. The
volumetric change resulting from glucose binding to the hydrogel sensor
was monitored by two different strategies: for the free-standing PS
sensor, the periodicity constant through measuring the zero/first-order
interspace (l), and for the contact-lens-based sensor,
the diffraction efficiency or the power of the first-order spot. The
PS sensor that is constrained on the contact lens has advantages of
rapid response time (3 s), a short saturation time (4 min), and high
sensitivity. Thus, a rapid and highly sensitive glucose sensor was
developed, and it offers simple/visual quantitative readouts. Contact
lenses based on PS sensor may find applications in quantitative glucose
measurements at point-of-care settings.

Methods
Materials
and Fabrication
Acrylamide (AA), N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS),
3-(acrylamido)phenylboronic acid (3-APBA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
2,2-diethoxyacetophenone (DEAP), β-d-(+) glucose, and
PBS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

The acrylamide hydrogel film was synthesized by free radical polymerization
utilizing DEAP as the photoinitiator and BIS as the cross-linker.
The monomer solution was prepared from AA (78.5 mol %), BIS (1.5 mol
%), 3-APBA (20 mol %), and DEAP in DMSO. The suspended monomer solution
was stir-mixed for 10 min at 24 °C. Monomer solution (100 μL)
was drop-cast directly onto a 1D photonic structure (600 lines mm–1). A hydrophobic glass slide was placed on top the
solution to obtain a layer having uniform thickness. Photopolymerization
process was initiated with a UV lamp (Black Ray, 365 nm), and the
sample was exposed to UV light for 5 min. The resulting periodic microstructure
hydrogel was peeled off from the master 1D photonic structure and
washed three times with deionized water and kept in dry conditions
in the dark prior to experiments.

Photonic Device Characterization
The photonic hydrogel
sensor (PHS) and the original 1D structure were investigated by optical
microscopy (Zeiss, 100× objective lens). Upon illumination with
blue (405 nm), green (532 nm), and red (650 nm) lasers, the diffraction
of monochromatic light (transmission mode) of the PHS in 40% relative
humidity and fully hydrated conditions was recorded to investigate
the effect of swelling on the PHS’s diffraction pattern. The
setup was fixed on an optical bench and composed of a 3D movable holder
for the sample, another movable holder for the light source, and a
movable screen on which the diffraction pattern was projected. A digital
camera was fixed near by the screen, where the diffraction fringes
for each blue, green, and red lasers were captured. These images were
analyzed by ImageJ (NIH) to measure the zero/first-order interspace
and the absolute diffraction efficiency. Transmission spectra of the
sensor at various polarization angles were recorded by a UV–vis
spectrometer attached to an optical microscope (Zeiss, 5× objective
lens). The PS sensor was illuminated by a broadband white light source,
where light passed through a linear polarizer and propagated through
the sensor. Transmitted light passed through another linear polarizer
which could be rotated from 0 to 90°. A 20× tube lens collected
the transmitted light at the imaging side of the microscope, which
was coupled with a photodetector to measure the spectra. Angle-resolved
measurements for the sensor were acquired by collecting the back-diffracted
light, while the sensor was positioned on an aluminum mirror and was
illuminated by a halogen light source (Ocean Optics HL-2000). The
incident angle of the white light was fixed at 38°, and the back-diffracted
light was collected by rotating the detector. To characterize the
response of the photonic hydrogel sensor to the variation in glucose
concentration, the hydrogel was equilibrated in PBS (7.4 pH, 24 °C,
ionic strength = 150 mM) for 2 h. Glucose concentrations from 0 to
100 mM were prepared in the same PBS. The sensor’s cross section
was measured under the optical microscope (5× lens) in different
glucose concentrations. The diffraction of a monochromatic light in
transmission mode for the sensor was utilized for visual detection
of the glucose concentrations.
