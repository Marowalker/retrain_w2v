Contributing to the need for new
graphene nanoribbon (GNR) structures
that can be synthesized with atomic precision, we have designed a
reactant that renders chiral (3,1)-GNRs after a multistep reaction
including Ullmann coupling and cyclodehydrogenation. The nanoribbon
synthesis has been successfully proven on different coinage metals,
and the formation process, together with the fingerprints associated
with each reaction step, has been studied by combining scanning tunneling
microscopy, core-level spectroscopy, and density functional calculations.
In addition to the GNR’s chiral edge structure, the substantial
GNR lengths achieved and the low processing temperature required to
complete the reaction grant this reactant extremely interesting properties
for potential applications.

Graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs)
are drawing enormous interest, partly due to their attractive electronic
properties.1,2 Those properties vary dramatically with
changes in the nanoribbon’s atomic structure in terms of width,3−5 crystallographic symmetry,6,7 dopant heteroatoms,8−13 and edge termination.14 Moreover, the
electronic properties can be modulated even further by the appropriate
design of GNR heterostructures.12,15−17 This enormous tunability of electronic properties is thus extremely
promising for next-generation nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.18,19 However, the high susceptibility of those properties to minimum
changes in the GNR structure also indicates the stringent need for
atomic precision in GNR synthesis. With the advent of bottom-up synthesis,1,2,20 increasingly high hopes are being
placed on this approach, but the field is still in its infancy. Thus,
although a large pool of GNRs with different edge orientations, widths,
or heteroatoms (and heterostructures thereof) should become available
to really allow for the envisioned breakthroughs in nanoelectronics
and the development of full GNR-based circuitry; so far, only few
GNRs have been successfully synthesized with the required selectivity
and precision.1,2,8−10,20−24

To date, the most widely studied nanoribbon is the armchair-oriented
GNR with seven dimer lines across its width (7-AGNR) that grows from
10,10′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthracene (reactant 1 in Figure 1a) in
a multistep reaction, including dehalogenation, polymerization (also
known as Ullmann coupling), and cyclodehydrogenation.20,25,26 The synthesis of 7-AGNR has been
shown to work reproducibly on substrates such as Au(111),20 Au(110),27 or Ag(111).20,28 Surprisingly, the same reactant 1 designed to render
AGNRs turned out to form chiral (3,1)-GNRs on Cu(111) (Figure 1).29,30 This result has been subject to debate31−34 since the polymerization does
not involve the carbon atoms attached to bromines. However, the debate
has been recently settled by unambiguous high-resolution imaging of
the resulting bonding structure.35 These
results mirror a very system-specific reaction mechanism not translatable
to other substrates, based on the surface-catalyzed, selective activation
of particular C–H bonds. In fact, similar results were obtained
from 1 and its nonhalogenated sister molecule, the latter
producing slightly longer GNRs.35 This
implies an absent or even negative impact of the halogenation of 1 for GNR growth on Cu(111).

Figure 1 (a) Schemes of the chemical reactions
of precursor 1 on various metallic surfaces. On Au(111)
and Ag(111), it affords
armchair GNRs. On Cu(111), it affords chiral (3,1)-GNRs. (b) Our work
(highlighted with the red line) reports the transformation of reactant 2 into chiral GNRs independently of the substrate [Au(111),
Ag(111), and Cu(111)]. Associated STM images are shown for poly-2 after initial polymerization by Ullmann coupling (5.6 nm
× 2.2 nm, I = 0.09 nA, U =
1.5 V), as well as for the final (3,1)-GNR after cyclodehydrogenation
(5.6 nm × 2.2 nm, I = 0.2 nA, U = −650 mV), both on Au(111). Steric hindrance causes poly-2 to be nonplanar. The high parts (circled in yellow) are
correspondingly marked in the polymer’s wireframe structure
above.

Nevertheless, those results have
inspired this work, in which we
introduce monomer 2, specifically designed to obtain
(3,1)-GNRs in a more efficient manner (Figure 1). In particular, the bromine atoms in positions
10,10′ of reactant 1 have been shifted in reactant 2 to positions 2,2′, which are the positions selectively
activated on Cu(111) and through which the polymerization preceding
the (3,1)-GNR formation takes place. The same structure can thus be
obtained from 2 following a conventional Ullmann coupling/cyclodehydrogenation
sequence. This has been shown to work independently of the used substrate,
as proven with growth studies on Au(111) and Ag(111). A similar study
on Cu(111) is out of the scope of this paper due to the readily proven
growth of (3,1)-GNRs from 1 (and even from nonhalogenated
precursors) on that substrate. However, also on Cu(111), we show how
changing the halogen functionalization site, and thereby changing
the polymerization mechanism from a selective C–H bond activation
to Ullmann coupling, is still a significant advancement by greatly
increasing the resultant GNR length.

Results and Discussion
Key to this work is the synthesis of bianthracene reactants with
adequately chosen bromine atom positions. We prepare 2,2′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthracene
(2) starting from phthalic anhydride (3),
following the four-step synthetic route shown in Figure 2 (see Supporting Information, Scheme S1 and Figures S1 and S2 for details).
The key reaction in this protocol is the reductive coupling of bromoanthrone 4 promoted by Zn.36

Figure 2 Synthetic route to obtain
dibromobianthracene 2 from
phthalic anhydride 3.

Starting from reactant 2, the reaction pathway
associated
with the surface-supported synthesis of (3,1)-GNRs is closely related
to the well-known transformation of 1 into 7-AGNRs. That
is, in a first step, the molecules polymerize by Ullmann coupling
into poly-2. This polymer is a highly nonplanar molecular
structure in which the steric hindrance between the H atoms in neighboring
anthracene units drives their alternating tilting (Figure 1b). As a consequence, the polymer’s
imaging by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) displays a sequence
of protruding features that we associate with the up-pointing ends
of the anthracene units. This correspondence is highlighted by yellow
circles in the wireframe chemical structure and in the STM image.
In a following reaction step, cyclodehydrogenation sets in and poly-2 transforms into the planar (3,1)-GNR structure, as can be
directly discerned in the high-resolution STM images in Figure 1b and Figure S3.

Figure 3 summarizes,
as observed by STM, the growth process of (3,1)-GNRs on top of Au(111)
and Ag(111). On either substrate, the images correspond to the same
sample at different stages of its growth: after deposition of 2 on substrates held at room temperature, after being annealed
to 150 °C, and after being annealed to 205 °C.

substrates held at room temperature (a,b,g,h), after being annealed
to 150 °C (c,d,i,j), and after being annealed to 205 °C
(e,f,k,l). STM imaging parameters are (a) I = 0.086

We first focus on Au(111). After room temperature deposition,
the
molecules aggregate into islands of linear structures formed by a
zig-zag arrangement of protrusions comparable to those expected from
poly-2 (Figure 3a,b). Upon annealing to 150 °C, we observe clear changes
in the sample’s topology. It is difficult to discern changes
in the STM contrast within the linear structures (see Supporting Information for details). However,
their overall length substantially increases and the spacing between
them (perpendicular to the structure’s long axis) becomes less
regular and decreases the minimum distance (Figure 3c,d). Annealing to 205 °C brings about
more notorious changes, displaying arrays of planar structures clearly
recognizable from the edge topology as (3,1)-GNRs (Figure 3e,f).

In the case of
Ag(111), two distinct sections are observed after
molecular deposition at room temperature. On the one hand, we find
regions of ordered, linear structures packed side by side (Figure 3g). The linear structures
are imaged again as zig-zagging protrusions (Figure 3h). Instead, other regions display a disordered
arrangement of adsorbates with increased mobility and a much larger
apparent height (∼2.7 Å vs ∼1.8
Å). The areal ratio between these two different sections is approximately
1:1 (Figure 3h). Annealing
to 150 °C brings about the growth of the ordered, linear structures
at the expense of the disappearing disordered regions (Figure 3i,j). As opposed to the findings
on Au(111), on Ag(111), the arrangement within the ordered arrays
of linear structures remains unchanged after this annealing. Annealing
the sample to 205 °C triggers the cyclodehydrogenation and thereby
the ultimate formation of (3,1)-GNRs (Figure 3k,l).

Complementary information on
the chemical transformation process
is obtained from core-level X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements. As in the STM experiment, molecules were deposited on
Au(111) and Ag(111) substrates held at room temperature. The samples
were then annealed stepwise while their Br 3p and C 1s core-level
spectra were monitored. The data are summarized in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Photoemission spectra
of the C 1s core levels of 2 deposited on (a) Au(111)
and (d) Ag(111) held at room temperature
and their evolution as a function of sample annealing temperature.
Similar measurements of the Br 3p core levels are shown in panels
(b) and (e). (c,f) Br 3p spectra, together with their associated fits
(blue and green lines correspond to organic and metal-bound Br components,
respectively), of two representative temperatures marked with the
colored lines in (b) and (e), respectively. The spectra are shifted
along the intensity axis for better comparison.

On Au(111), the molecules remain intact upon deposition at
room
temperature and only start showing chemical changes for substrate
temperatures of around 125 °C. As the temperature increases above
that threshold, the most evident change in the core-level spectra
is a pronounced shift of the Br 3p peaks to ∼2 eV lower binding
energies. This effect is well-known from other studies on Ullmann
coupling of different precursors and relates to the dehalogenation
process and the new chemical environment as Br detaches from the organic
molecule and binds to the metallic surface.27,37,38 Concomitantly, the C 1s peak displays a
smaller shift (∼0.3 eV) to lower binding energies. Similar
C 1s shifts have also been observed in previous studies on Ullmann
coupling with different precursors and surfaces, for which a variety
of explanations have been given: (i) bond formation between the C
atoms hosting the generated radicals and the substrate atoms or adatoms,27,37 (ii) a change in the supramolecular assembly prior to dehalogenation
that brings about changes in the interaction with the substrate,38 or (iii) a change of work function caused by
the chemisorption of Br to the substrate.37 We discard the first because on Au the formation of organometallic
compounds is disfavored and the molecules are known to polymerize
as the radicals are formed.39,40 We also discard the
second because we observe the C 1s and Br 3p shifts simultaneously
in a correlated way. Thus, we ascribe the observed C 1s shift to the
change of work function generated by the metal-bound Br atoms. Besides,
this is further supported by the changes observed in the core levels
as the temperature is increased further: as Br desorption starts to
set in, the C 1s level shifts in the opposite direction, toward higher
binding energy. A similar shift on closely related systems has also
been ascribed to different reaction processes like the transformation
from an organometallic to a polymer phase27,41 or cyclodehydrogenation.37 In addition
to the chemical change, these reactions also cause an alteration in
the molecule–substrate distance that may, in turn, additionally
affect the core-hole screening effects and thereby the core-level
spectra. However, we can again discard these justifications for our
system because we know the polymerization and cyclodehydrogenation
to occur at lower temperatures. Altogether, XPS on Au(111) thus shows
that the structures observed on Au(111) at room temperature are a
noncovalent self-assembled supramolecular arrangement, polymerizing
only upon annealing above 125 °C, in line with the overall sample
topology changes observed by STM at 150 °C and described above.

On Ag(111), the molecules are readily partially dehalogenated upon
deposition at room temperature. This is clearly observed in the Br
3p core-level spectra, which shows the coexistence of organic and
metal-linked Br atoms in a 1:1 ratio. As the temperature is increased,
the metal-bound Br increases at the expense of the organic Br. From
the correlation with the STM observations, we can readily ascribe
the pristine precursors to the disordered structures found at room
temperature and the dehalogenated molecules to be the building blocks
forming the ordered structures. As in Au(111), the dehalogenation
brings about a minor shift to lower binding energy in the C 1s spectrum,
which shifts back again as the Br is desorbed at higher temperatures.
Again, we ascribe the dominating effect behind the C 1s shifts to
the changes in work function as Br binds or leaves the metal surface.
However, spectroscopy-wise, this leaves the question open as to what
is the nature of the linear, ordered structures formed by the dehalogenated
precursors. Do those radical species link covalently or via metal–organic coordination, as is commonly the case on Ag
at temperatures below ∼150 °C? In the absence of clear
spectroscopic fingerprints, the answer will be given based on periodicity
analysis along the one-dimensional structures, organometallic structures
typically having significantly larger periodicities than polymers.40,42,43

Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations for free-standing
structures predict periodicities of 9.52 Å for the metal–organic
chain (Figure 5c),
8.21 Å for the polymer (Figure 5b), and 8.96 Å for the flat (3,1)-GNR (Figure 5a), the latter in
good agreement with the value of 8.89 Å that results from assuming
an undisturbed graphene lattice for the GNR. Our STM measurements
reveal the periodicity of the GNRs to be 9.0 ± 0.8 Å, excellently
fitting the calculations. For the nonplanar structures, we observe
the same periodicity at room temperature and after annealing to 150
°C, with an average value of 8.2 ± 0.7 Å. The value
is similar to that of poly-2 on Au(111) (8.3 ± 0.6
Å) and in excellent agreement with a polymeric phase, with the
error margins remaining clearly under the metal–organic periodicity
(Figure 5d). Thus,
in spite of the flexibility associated with the nonplanarity of poly-2 and the metal–organic chain, which may introduce
minor uncertainties in the calculated periodicities, the results still
allow us to conclude that the polymer is directly formed after dehalogenation.

the periodicities of the calculated structures with those measured
experimentally for the GNRs and for the nonplanar structure on Ag(111).
The latter fits the polymer period, and its error margin (shown as
the standard deviation) is well below the periodicity of the metal–organic
chain.

As only reported with a few other
systems,44 we thus observe a covalent polymer
formation readily at room temperature
instead of the metal–organic intermediates reported with most
precursors linking through Ullmann coupling on Ag(111) and Cu(111).37,39−42 The reason behind this may be sought in the different coordination
geometry imposed by the nonplanar precursors. As observed in most
previous Ullmann coupling studies on Ag surfaces, Ag atoms present
linear coordination geometry,39,40,42 while the anthracene units hosting the generated radicals upon dehalogenation
of 2 display a strong tilt with respect to the substrate
plane due to the steric congestion within the organic backbone (Figure 5c). Under these circumstances,
and based on our experimental observations, we conclude that the metal–organic
intermediate is not sufficiently stable and the reaction directly
proceeds toward the polymeric phase.

As noted above, at 205
°C, the GNRs are fully cyclodehydrogenated
on both Ag(111) and Au(111). Similarly, low cyclodehydrogenation temperatures
(177 °C) are reported for reactant 1 on Ag(111),28 but higher temperatures, similar to those required
on Au(111), are needed to really form GNRs (377 °C).20,28 On Cu(111), the required temperature for fully cyclodehydrogenated
GNRs to be formed is 250 °C.33,35 Most remarkably,
reactant 2 renders fully dehydrogenated GNRs at significantly
lower temperatures than 1 even on the low reactivity
Au(111) surface. This surprisingly large change relates to the substantially
altered strain in the two polymer structures since sterically induced
strain is known to weaken the involved C–H bonds and thereby
lower the cyclodehydrogenation barriers.25,45 In poly-1, the anthracene units are linked covalently
along their short axis by a bond that allows free rotational movement
with respect to their neighbors. This freedom results in alternatively
tilted anthracene units along the polymer backbone so as to minimize
the steric hindrance from opposing H atoms. Instead, the anthracene
units within poly-2 are linked covalently to their neighbors
both along their long and short axes. Thus, although the anthracene
units still display the same alternative tilt to reduce the steric
hindrance, the covalent bonds along the long anthracene’s axes
limit the structure’s rotational freedom, resulting in a substantially
strained geometry. It is this strain opposing the anthracene’s
tilting which favors the planarization of the structure and thus reduces
the cyclodehydrogenation temperature threshold regardless of the substrate.

Both on Ag(111) and Au(111), the cyclodehydrogenation threshold
is between 150 °C, at which no cyclodehydrogenation is observed,
and 205 °C, at which the whole sample has readily become fully
planar (Figure 3).
On Ag(111), where polymerization readily starts at room temperature,
there is still a substantial temperature gap before the onset of cyclodehydrogenation.
However, on Au(111), the threshold temperatures for polymerization
(∼125 °C) and cyclodehydrogenation are in close proximity.
This may have an impact on the growth process and the resulting GNRs
since liberated H in the cyclodehydrogenation process could quench
the available radicals and terminate the polymerization. To shed light
on this issue, we have increased the number of sampling temperatures,
figuring the cyclodehydrogenation onset on Au(111) to be below 175
°C, at which most of the sample has readily become a planar GNR
but some of the polymer units still remain unreacted (inset in Figure 6). A systematic GNR
length analysis of samples as a function of the substrate temperature
upon reactant deposition is shown in Figure 6, with all samples having coverages of around
0.8 ML. For temperatures below the cyclodehydrogenation threshold,
a second annealing step to 205 °C was applied to the sample for
GNR formation before performing the length analysis.

Figure 6 (a) Length distribution
of GNRs grown on Au, at coverages close
to the full monolayer, for different substrate temperatures upon first
deposition. For temperatures below the cyclodehydrogenation threshold
(T < 174 °C), a second annealing step to
205 °C was applied to the sample for GNR formation by cyclodehydrogenation.
(b) Median length for each substrate temperature. The inset depicts
an STM image (7.4 nm × 2.9 nm, I = 0.16 nA, U = 0.47 V) of a sample deposited at 174 °C, revealing
a mostly, but not yet fully, cyclodehydrogenated structure. This value
has been thus taken as the cyclodehydrogenation threshold temperature.

Representative distributions for
selected temperatures are shown
in Figure 6a, making
immediately obvious that high temperatures narrow the distribution
significantly and prevent formation of long GNRs. Because of the asymmetric
length distribution, we take the median length as a representative
value and plot it versus substrate temperature upon
first deposition (Figure 6b). We observe an important drop in the length with increasing
temperature once the cyclodehydrogenation threshold is passed. Under
this scenario, radical step growth and cyclodehydrogenation take place
simultaneously. Thus, radical quenching by liberated H atoms competes
with the radical step-growth polymerization. Deposition on Au held
at room temperature and subsequent annealing to cyclodehodrogenation
temperatures suffers from the same effect because the precursors on
the surface remain intact at room temperature, and both polymerization
and cyclodehydrogenation occur during the same subsequent annealing
process. However, the length-limiting effect is less pronounced, among
other reasons, due to the finite heating rate. Longest GNRs are obtained
at substrate temperatures that first activate polymerization, only
to form the GNRs in a subsequent annealing process. Under these circumstances,
GNRs in excess of 30 nm can be easily obtained, well beyond the longest
(3,1)-GNRs obtained from 1 on Cu(111).30 Moreover, additional studies to maximize GNR lengths by
optimizing surface coverages or heating rates may bring about even
further improvements in the future.

Lastly, we have confirmed
the suitability of this molecule to form
longer (3,1)-GNRs than 1 also on Cu(111). This is shown
in Figure 7 and underlines
the great advancement provided by this new GNR precursor. In addition
to the (3,1)-GNR formation, a concomitant etching of triangular holes
into the remaining uncovered Cu(111) surface is observed, lined along
their sides by Br atoms (Figure 7). A detailed study and description of this process,
however, is beyond the scope of this paper. We also want to note that
the GNR length analysis of this sample on Cu(111) (Figure 7c) should not be compared with
that on Au(111) (Figure 6) because the growth was performed in a different chamber with different
coverage and a different heating rate, two parameters that may play
an important role in the length distribution. However, most importantly,
we want to remark that, different from what occurs with precursor 1 on Cu(111), the precursor 2 allows on the one
hand to grow chiral GNRs on different materials not relying on specific
and strong molecule–substrate interactions. On the other hand,
on all surfaces studied, it forms long GNRs that easily exceed several
tens of nanometers, a great advantage for their implementation in
actual device structures.

Conclusions
Inspired by the previously reported system-specific
growth of (3,1)-GNRs
on Cu(111) from precursor 1, we have designed an alternative
building block 2 that renders the same (3,1)-GNRs but
now independently of the substrate material. This has been proven
on Au(111), Ag(111), and Cu(111), revealing additional advantages
of the use of this monomer in the growth of selective and atomically
precise GNRs, as is the substantially increased length of the resultant
GNRs and the low processing temperature required for their formation.
Furthermore, the growth process has been followed in detail combining
core-level spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and density
functional theory calculations, providing a clear correlation between
the spectroscopic fingerprints and the different reaction processes,
as well as revealing the unusual absence of a metastable metal–organic
intermediate preceding the covalent polymerization in the Ullmann
coupling process on Ag(111).

Methods
The
various metal (111) surfaces were all prepared by standard
sputtering–annealing cycles. Subsequently, the samples were
prepared by thermal evaporation of 2 at ∼140 °C
onto the substrate. Substrate temperature was controlled by resistive
heating, and the calibration for the STM experiments was performed
by direct measurement of the substrate surface temperature, as a function
of the resistive heating current, with a thermocouple fixed and glued
to the surface with silver paint after completion of the experiments
(see Supporting Information for more details).
STM was measured in a commercial UHV system at room temperature, except
for the GNR image in Figure 1b, measured in a commercial UHV system at 5 K. WSxM software
was used to process all STM images.47 XPS
measurements were performed using a non-monochromatized source. The
XPS data were collected by means of a SPECS Phoibos 100 hemispherical
electron analyzer, making use of Al Kα X-ray emission.

Ab initio calculations were carried out on free-standing
structures using DFT, as implemented in the SIESTA code.48−50 The optB88-vdW functional, which accounts for nonlocal corrections,
was adopted for the exchange and correlation potential. We employed
a double-ζ plus polarization basis set and a mesh cutoff of
300 Ry for the real-space integrations. A variable-cell relaxation
of the periodic systems was performed until residual forces on all
atoms were less than 0.01 eV/Å and a Monkhorst–Pack mesh
with 101 × 1 × 1 k-point sampling of the
three-dimensional Brillouin zone was used.
