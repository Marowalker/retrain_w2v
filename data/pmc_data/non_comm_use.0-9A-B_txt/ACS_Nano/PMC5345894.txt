An
increasing number of studies have recently reported the rapid
degradation of hybrid and all-inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals
under electron beam irradiation in the transmission electron microscope,
with the formation of nanometer size, high contrast particles. The
nature of these nanoparticles and the involved transformations in
the perovskite nanocrystals are still a matter of debate. Herein,
we have studied the effects of high energy (80/200 keV) electron irradiation
on colloidal cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) nanocrystals
with different shapes and sizes, especially 3 nm thick nanosheets,
a morphology that facilitated the analysis of the various ongoing
processes. Our results show that the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
undergo a radiolysis process, with electron stimulated desorption
of a fraction of bromine atoms and the reduction of a fraction of
Pb2+ ions to Pb0. Subsequently Pb0 atoms diffuse and aggregate, giving rise to the high contrast particles,
as previously reported by various groups. The diffusion is facilitated
by both high temperature and electron beam irradiation. The early
stage Pb nanoparticles are epitaxially bound to the parent CsPbBr3 lattice, and evolve into nonepitaxially bound Pb crystals
upon further irradiation, leading to local amorphization and consequent
dismantling of the CsPbBr3 lattice. The comparison among
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with various shapes and sizes evidences
that the damage is particularly pronounced at the corners and edges
of the surface, due to a lower diffusion barrier for Pb0 on the surface than inside the crystal and the presence of a larger
fraction of under-coordinated atoms.

Lead halide
perovskites, both
hybrid and all-inorganic, with general formula APbX3 (with
A+ = CH3NH3+/NH2CH=NH2+/Cs+, and X– = Cl–/Br–/I–), have remarkable electronic properties1 that make them promising for applications in photovoltaics2 and optoelectronics.3−5 Compared to
their bulk counterparts, APbX3 nanocrystals (NCs) have
one or more dimensions that are reduced to a few to tens of nanometers,
and their size and morphology can be manipulated to tune their optical
properties.6,7 However, since surfaces and interfaces play
important roles in material degradation,8,9 perovskite
NCs may be inherently more unstable under irradiation by several sources
(laser light, X-rays, electrons), heating, or exposure to moisture,
than the corresponding bulk crystals.6−10 Such instability represents a major limitation for the widespread
application of halide perovskite NCs in devices.

Recent transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) studies of lead halide
perovskite NCs (CH3NH3PbX3,10,11 (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4,12 and CsPbX313−17) have consistently reported the appearance of few nanometer size
high contrast particles upon irradiation. Some of these reports indicated
that the particles are made of metallic lead,11,13,16,17 a claim that
is supported by the evidence that Pb2+ species from various
material systems can be reduced to Pb0 by irradiation with
electrons18 or with X-rays.8,19 Other studies of irradiation of APbX3 NCs have suggested
that PbBr211 is also formed.
Such discrepancies among the various reports underline an incomplete
understanding of the overall transformations in the perovskite NCs,
and especially of those leading to these high contrast particles.
Compared to halide perovskites, the behavior of other materials systems
under electron beam irradiation is better understood. For example,
previous studies on oxides and on CaF2 have shown that
their irradiation by an electron beam can induce the nucleation of
metal particles and surface metallization.20−24 One typical case is the transformation of PbO2 to Pb through an intermediate PbO phase.18 It is known that the nucleation of metal particles and
the surface metallization on oxides or on CaF2 occur in
parallel with electron stimulated desorption processes through electronic
excitation: in practice, while the cations are reduced to their metallic
states, the anions (i.e., oxygen ions in oxides or
fluoride ions in CaF2) are oxidized to neutral or even
to positive species, which readily desorb from the surface.21,25−27 Stimulated desorption processes also occur under
other types of irradiation, for example by photons.25

Here we demonstrate that high energy (80/200 keV)
electron irradiation
of APbX3 (CsPbX3 in the present case) NCs in
a TEM causes the desorption of halogen species and the nucleation
of metallic Pb particles. Also, by a temperature dependent study we
were able to provide several details of the mechanism by which the
Pb nanoparticles are formed. Our analysis was carried out on colloidal
NCs having different shapes (cubes, wires, sheets), although it was
mainly focused on CsPbBr3 nanosheets with 3 nm thickness
and hundreds of nm width, a morphology that allows the observation
of multiple events under identical irradiation conditions. We could
identify two main stages in the transformation: (i) electron stimulated
desorption of Br atoms and concomitant reduction of Pb2+ to Pb0, and (ii) diffusion of Pb0 atoms and
their aggregation into Pb nanoparticles, with local amorphization
and severe dismantling of the CsPbBr3 NCs. This process
is more pronounced at lower electron energy, higher electron dose,
and higher temperature, and is favored in higher surface-to-volume
ratio NCs.

Results and Discussion
Knock-on damage and radiolysis
are the two major electron-specimen
interactions operative in an electron microscope with an incident
electron energy of tens or hundreds of kiloelectron volt (keV).28 Knock-on damage involves an irreversible displacement
of the nuclei in the specimen, when the transferred energy overcomes
the displacement energy of the atoms in the material, and it is dominant
at high energy.26,28,29 Ionization damage (or radiolysis) involves inelastic scattering,
and is dominant at low energy.28,29 In the present case,
for a better comprehension of the electron-specimen interaction we
evaluated the evolution of halide perovskite NCs, which involved appreciable
compositional change, upon electron beam irradiation at two different
values of incident electron energy (E0) (see Figure S1). In particular, we verified
that 80 keV electrons cause more effective damage (in terms of loss
of Br atoms) than 200 keV electrons, suggesting that radiolysis rather
than knock-on is the major mechanism of damage, as expected for both
covalent and ionic crystals.29 Therefore,
a thorough analysis of the compositional change of the perovskite
NCs upon irradiation was carried out at E0 = 80 keV from areas containing thin nanosheets (3 nm thick, prepared
as reported in our previous work14) at
room temperature (RT), by acquiring energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) spectra at regular time intervals up to a total accumulated
dose of 6.5 × 104 e–/Å2. Note that the starting 3 nm thick nanosheets were Cs-deficient
(Cs1–xPbBr3, Figure S1), while the thicker crystals (for example,
> 10 nm thick nanosheets) had the expected CsPbBr3 stoichiometry.
However, for the sake of simplicity, the stoichiometric formula (CsPbBr3) will be used to address also the 3 nm thick nanosheets throughout
this work.

Figure 1(a) reports
EDS spectra (in the energy range of interest) at increasing doses
from scanning TEM (STEM)-EDS analysis. Compositional changes were
plotted by measuring the net peak intensity (proportional to the number
of atoms) of the three elements of interest (Figure 1(b)). Upon irradiation, Cs and Pb intensities
did not change appreciably, while the signal from Br decreased, especially
at higher electron dose. This was also evident in the EDS elemental
maps acquired at the boundary regions between areas exposed to different
electron doses (see Figure S2). Note that
an initial Br:Pb ratio lower than the stoichiometric one (3:1) was
most likely caused by electron induced Br loss as soon as the EDS
measurement was started. Such loss of Br atoms is analogous to the
electron stimulated desorption of fluorine in CaF2, or
of oxygen in several oxides, as said before.26 In the case of CaF2, F– is oxidized
to F0 or to F+, and likewise in oxides O2– is oxidized to O0 or to O+.
The neutral species (F0 or O0) diffuse and are
desorbed due to their low reactivity. When positively charged species
are formed, the Madelung potential is repulsive, and such species
would be desorbed quickly when they are close to the surface.26 In our samples (and as already reported by others12−15), in parallel with the Br loss, high contrast particles were formed
during electron beam irradiation on CsPbBr3 (orthorhombic
phase, ICSD 97851), and these were identified as metal Pb nanoparticles
with face centered cubic structure (ICSD 96501, see high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image in Figure 1(c)).

irradiation

in the energy range of interest at increasing electron doses (E0 = 80 keV); (b) Plot of the net integrated
peak intensity for Cs, Pb, and Br as a function of the electron dose

(c) HRTEM of a Pb nanoparticle formed on CsPbBr3 nanosheet,

Transform (FFT) with the spots for CsPbBr3 {220} and Pb
{200} circled.

We can therefore state
that such transformations are due to electron
stimulated desorption of Br and reduction of Pb2+ to Pb0. From Figure 1(a), the maximum fractional loss of Br was close to 2/3. Assuming
that all the Pb2+ ions were reduced at the maximum loss
of Br, we infer that the reduction of one Pb2+ ion was
accompanied by the loss of two Br atoms, and this implies that a considerable
fraction of Br– ions was very likely oxidized to
Br0, and also that such oxidized species could diffuse
and were ultimately desorbed from the NCs. A similar process was found
to affect CsPbX3 NCs with different halogens (X=Cl,
I) and even Cs4PbBr6 NCs (Figure S3). Details on the syntheses of these nanocrystals
are found in the Supporting Information (SI). We also found that even irradiation by X-rays, by using the
X-ray source of a X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), can cause
a slight reduction of Pb2+ and a slight desorption of Br
(see Figure S4). Therefore, our results
and the observation of the Pb0 peak in recent XPS studies
of organic lead halide perovskites8,30 imply that
the Br desorption (and Pb2+ reduction) can be triggered
by different types of radiation and can be generally classified as
a stimulated desorption process. On the other hand, under irradiation
by UV laser light lead halide perovskite NCs may undergo degradation via a different mechanism, as reported by Wang et
al.(31)

As mentioned above,
the damage of CsPbBr3 nanosheets
was slower at higher incident electron energy (E0 = 200 keV), hence this condition was chosen to capture the
details of the following stage of evolution. Our experiments clearly
show that Pb0 atoms aggregated to form Pb nanoparticles
at a rate that depended on the temperature (see high angle annular
dark field (HAADF)-STEM images in Figure 2). At low temperatures (i.e., −60 °C or lower), Br atoms were desorbed (Figure S1(b,c)) and Pb2+ ions were
most likely reduced to Pb0, according to the electron-stimulated
desorption mechanism described above. However, no Pb nanoparticles
were visible (see Figure 2(a−c) and their HRTEM images in Figure S5(a)). This result suggests that, at these temperatures,
Pb0 atoms did not have enough energy to overcome the activation
barrier for diffusion, which would have enabled them to cluster into
Pb particles at the surface of the NCs. Still, in this temperature
range one cannot exclude that clusters containing only a few atoms
(Pb nanoclusters) were formed, but in that case they were simply not
discernible in the images. At higher temperatures (i.e., −40 °C or above), and still under irradiation, Pb0 atoms (and probably also clusters of Pb atoms) could instead
diffuse and coalesce into observable Pb nanoparticles23,32 (Figure 2(d–f)
and Figure S5(b)). As a general trend,
higher temperatures promoted the formation of larger Pb particles
(compare for example Figures 2d–f).

Figure 2 Effect of temperature on the nucleation and growth of
Pb nanoparticles
in 3 nm thick CsPbBr3 nanosheets, as shown in HAADF-STEM
images (Scale bars: 50 nm, E0 = 200 keV,
the total doses for acquiring all the images are approximately ∼1.0
× 103 e–/Å2): (a)
−160 °C; (b) −90 °C; (c) −60 °C;
(d) −40 °C; (e) RT; (f) 40 °C.

A question arises on whether electron beam heating has an
important
effect here. This is certainly true in materials with poor thermal
conductivity. The two parameters that play a pivotal role in electron
beam heating are dose rate (proportional to the beam current) and
incident electron energy (E0). In the
high temperature conditions at which visible Pb nanoparticles are
formed, a study on the dependence of Pb nanoparticle formation on
the irradiation dose rate for 200 keV electrons is reported in Figure S6. It shows that, in the range between
8.5 × 105 and 2.0 × 108 e–/Å2/s, the increase of size of Pb nanoparticle with
increasing dose rate is negligible. The dose rate used in typical
HRTEM and STEM imaging is within this range. Nevertheless, a higher
dose rate induces the production of larger Pb nanoparticles, as demonstrated
in Figure S6. We also found that at low
temperatures (−60 °C or lower, which were conditions that
did not promote the formation of observable Pb nanoparticles), with
the same dose rate (5.0 × 106 e–/Å2/s) used in Figure 2 (a–c) not even electron irradiation with ten
times higher doses could induce the appearance of Pb nanoparticles.
This suggests that a significant temperature rise does not occur even
under irradiation with much higher doses. These observations evidence
that electron beam heating of CsPbBr3 has a negligible
effect at our experimental conditions for E0 = 200 keV. 80 keV electrons would have a thermal effect that is
approximately 1.6 times the one from 200 keV electrons, which is still
negligible within the dose rate employed in this work (see a more
detailed discussion in the SI). In two
different irradiation experiments, carried out at the higher temperature
side of our tested interval (−40 °C and RT, see Figure 2(d,e)), we counted
the numbers of Pb0 atoms within the observed nanoparticles
and found them comparable (∼5 × 105 in total,
the Methods section explains how the calculations
were made). This suggests that, although the perovskite lattice collapses
locally, the Pb0 species are not lost from the NCs, a result
that goes hand in hand with the quantitative EDS results reported
in Figure 1. Instead,
they are mainly sequestered in the formation of the metallic clusters,
if the temperature is high enough.

Both temperature and electron
irradiation have a role in the nucleation
and growth of Pb0 clusters. The effect of temperature has
already been mentioned, and was made more evident by the control experiments
reported in Figure 3. In this case, the sample was first irradiated at −20 °C,
after which the temperature was raised (to RT). If, during this latter
step, the electron beam was blanked (i.e., it was
prevented to hit the sample), the initial, barely visible Pb nanoparticles
that had formed at −20 °C evolved into larger particles
(diameter ≤ 1.8 nm, an average value is hard to evaluate due
to their small sizes), supporting the idea of temperature promoted
diffusion of Pb0 species. If the temperature was raised
while the sample was being irradiated, considerably larger Pb nanoparticles
(2.3 ± 0.8 nm) were formed (see Figure 3). The electron induced heating is negligible
at the used dose rate 8.5 × 105 e–/Å2/s as discussed above and in Figure S6. It is likely that this occurred as the electron
irradiation contributes to enhancing the diffusivity of Pb0 species and of small Pb nanoparticles by transferring momentum and
energy to them.23,33 In addition, new Pb0 species were continuously generated by irradiation. This implies
that, although the initial Br desorption and Pb2+ reduction
is mainly due to a radiolysis process, we should also consider a contribution
of knock-on displacement in the Pb nanoparticle nucleation process.

(b) Following the acquisition of the image (a), the substrate temperature
was raised to RT for 10 min with electron beam blanked, and again

In the high temperature range, the Pb0 atoms can
form
the Pb nanoparticles by diffusing both along the surface and through
the inner regions of the perovskite NCs, although diffusion from the
bulk should be less marked in thicker samples. We compared the behavior
of thin nanosheets (3 nm thick) with that of the thicker sheets (tens
of nm thick) that were also present in the sample (note that the thicker
sheets represented only a minor fraction of the sample). The comparison
was quantified through compositional change under the same irradiation
conditions. As shown in Figure S7, the
Br concentration (at.%) dropped from 57% to 50% for 3 nm thick nanosheets,
while it remained nearly constant at 59% for thicker nanosheets. The
comparison evidenced that the thick nanosheets had undergone much
less change and consequently less damage compared to the thin nanosheets
(see Figure S7). This implies that both
desorption of Br and aggregation of Pb0 species occur preferentially
at the surface, which is expected since the surface is generally characterized
by a lower barrier to atomic diffusion. Also, both Br and Pb atoms
have lower coordination at the surface and their electronic configuration
may be more easily altered by electron irradiation and additionally
Br species are more easily desorbed when they are bound to surface
sites than to inner regions of the sheets. As a consequence, the surface
is energetically less stable than the bulk and plays an important
role in the electron beam-induced degradation of perovskite NCs. Similar
conclusions were drawn by Philippe et al.(8) and Yuan et al.(9) by exposing APbX3 thin films to different irradiations.

In addition to nanosheets, we also tested colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs with nanocuboid and nanowire shapes and different sizes,
for which the syntheses are found in the Methods section. Overall, we found that the samples with higher surface-to-volume
ratio (3 nm thick nanosheets, nanowires with diameters smaller than
10 nm, and nanocuboids with 8 nm edge) were more susceptible to electron
irradiation than the samples with lower surface-to-volume ratio (see Figure 4, S7 and S8). The latter included: nanosheets that were tens
of nm thick, nanowires wider than 10 nm, and cuboids with 20–40
nm edge (see Figures 4 and S7). In these larger NCs, the internal
structure appeared to be preserved under irradiation, and only a few
Pb nanoparticles were formed at their surface. On the other hand,
lowering the incident electron energy to 80 keV could cause significant
damage even to these NCs, due to the increased probability of inelastic
interaction. An increase in temperature could also promote the process
by speeding up the diffusion along the surface, as well as by promoting
the diffusion from the inner regions of the NCs (above 60 °C),
and this led to their fast degradation (see Figure S9). The dynamic evolution at high temperature for large nanocuboids
is demonstrated in the Supporting Video S1. High surface-to-volume ratio NCs readily decomposed, which is clearly
demonstrated in Figure 4. The 5 nm wide nanowires broke due to the formation of Pb nanoparticles.
It is also remarkable that these Pb nanoparticles were rather regularly
spaced along the wires. The nanocuboids with edge length of 8 nm decomposed
by forming Pb nanoparticles at the corners (see Figure S8). A close investigation of Figure 4 revealed that edges and corners of the NCs
are preferential sites for Pb particle formation.

preferential formation of Pb nanoparticles
at the edges and corners of CsPbBr3 NCs: (a) 5 nm wide
nanowires; (b) 20 nm wide nanowire; (c) nanocuboids with 8 nm edge;
(d) nanocuboids with 20–40 nm edge (Scale bars: 20 nm, E0 = 200 keV, RT).

The starting sites of Pb reduction and Br desorption may
be linked
to defects. At a defect site, Pb ions may undergo reduction more easily.
Starting preferentially from the defects, on 3 nm thick nanosheet
voids with Pb nanoparticles on the edge are created. The formation
of these Pb nanoparticles consumes part of the Pb from the surrounding
perovskite lattice and leads to the formation of few small Pb nanoparticles
at the surrounding locations. Overall, these processes result in the
inhomogeneous damage in a single nanosheet (as can be seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3), even though the whole nanosheet
is under homogeneous electron irradiation.

To monitor the formation
of Pb nanoparticles at different sites
under identical irradiation conditions, we took advantage of the large
field of view of the direct electron detection camera combined with
the large lateral size of the nanosheet to record them in a single
HRTEM image (Figure 5(a)). Magnified views from the same image are displayed in Figure 5(b–f); i.e., all the events in these regions occurred simultaneously
under the same irradiation conditions, which show as an eye-catching
feature that the evolution of Pb nanoparticles at different sites
is not synchronous. Some of the Pb nanoparticles exhibited a single-crystal
structure, anisotropic shape (i.e., square/hexagonal
projection) and well-defined orientation relationship (epitaxy) with
the parent CsPbBr3 nanosheet (orthorhombic phase with ICSD:
97851, [001]-oriented on the support film). The relationships were:
CsPbBr3 [001] ∥ Pb [001], CsPbBr3 (110)
∥ Pb (100), as shown for the particles in Figure 5(b,c) and for some of the particles
of Figure 5(d,e). This
suggests that the Pb atoms at the edge of these Pb nanoparticles may
be bound to the parent CsPbBr3 lattice, and these are presumably
early stage particles. Nonepitaxially bound, roughly spherical shapes
were also found, such as the particles in Figure 5(e,f), including twinned NCs (particle P1).
These nanoparticles may have resulted from a rearrangement of early
stage Pb nanoparticles upon further irradiation. Our results support
the idea that the epitaxial Pb particles bound to the surrounding
parent lattice can survive until a critical size (i.e., number of Pb atoms). Above that size, the Pb atoms in the particle
lose the epitaxial relationship with the surround lattice and rearrange,
forming more isotropic particles which are thermodynamically more
stable. This can be rationalized as due to two major reasons: (i)
edge atoms are weakly bound to the surrounding lattice and the unstable
bonds between the edge atoms and the surrounding lattice are broken
due to the ongoing irradiation; and (ii) rearrangement results in
the emergence of facets of lower energy. Among these more isotropic
particles, some Pb nanocrystals exhibit twinning, a type of defect
that is often seen in the case of metal nano- and microparticles,
due to its low formation energy in metals.34 By feeding the Pb atoms to the surrounding Pb nanoparticles, some
areas on the CsPbBr3 nanosheet turned into voids decorated
by Pb nanoparticles at their edges (see Figure 5(e,f) and Figure 2(e,f)), while the Cs atoms as well as the
remaining Pb and Br species were randomly distributed in the voids.

of interest in (a) (Scale bars: 5 nm).

Once formed, the Pb nanoparticles were not stable under further
electron irradiation. The evolution of the number and size distribution
of the Pb nanoparticles is reported in Figure 6. At an electron dose of 400 e–/Å2, around 170 Pb nanoparticles had nucleated in
the area shown in the HAADF-STEM image in Figure 6(a). This number rapidly increased to 310
at a dose of 600 e–/Å2 (Figure 6(a,b)). These nanoparticles
were not stable and were dismantled under further electron irradiation:
the number decreased to 70 at a dose of 3.9 × 103 e–/Å2 (Figure 6(a,b)), and the particles basically disappeared
at even higher doses. The same holds for Pb nanoparticles produced
at different temperatures (see Figure S10). The size distribution of the Pb nanoparticles also changed during
electron irradiation. For the Pb nanoparticles formed in Figure 6(a), the average
size was 1.5 nm at a dose of 400 e–/Å2 and increased to 2.1 nm at a dose of 1.1 × 103 e–/Å2. At a given temperature (i.e., surface diffusion rate), an equilibrium size was reached
and did not increase any longer, and instead started to gradually
decrease to 1.7 nm at a dose of 3.9 × 103 e–/Å2.

nm thick
CsPbBr3 nanosheets at RT as a function of electron irradiation

at four doses (Scale bars: 20 nm); (b) Number of Pb nanoparticles versus electron dose; (c) Average size of Pb nanoparticles versus electron dose (the diameter is calculated from the
area by assuming a circular shape, error bar is the standard deviation).

The dominant reason for Pb particle
size variation with increasing
total dose is not heating. Note that, the slow variation of the average
diameter of the Pb nanoparticles over time was due to the asynchronous
evolution they underwent at different sites. According to our analysis
based on the elemental maps of Figure S11, a Pb nanoparticle forms and then its size decreases under further
electron irradiation, until the particle finally disappears. As the
Pb composition recorded in the analyzed areas is constant (see the
discussion for Figure 1) the dissolution of the Pb nanoparticle is unlikely to be the result
of a sublimation or vaporization process. We also tend to exclude
the participation of metallic Pb atoms in redox reactions under electron
irradiation conditions, even though the surroundings of the Pb particles
are chemically active. This is because, to do so, the metallic Pb
atoms would have to stably lose electrons (i.e.,
be oxidized), which is unlikely when electrons are continuously supplied
by irradiation.

The mechanism of dissolution of the Pb nanoparticles
is revealed
by the HRTEM study in Figure S12–S14. Following the amorphization of the Pb nanoparticles (Figure S12 and Figure S13), with further irradiation,
Pb atoms spread out on the supporting film. In the case of 3 nm thick
nanosheet, on which Pb nanoparticles decorate the edge of voids, the
dissolution of Pb nanoparticles under further electron irradiation
causes the decrease of the size of the voids, as observed in Figure 6. The dissolution
of Pb nanoparticles from one isolated nanocuboid leads to continuous
decomposition of the nanocuboid (Figure S13), while for an array of closely spaced nanocuboids the spread atoms
accumulate at the regions between cuboids and appear as hollow frames
that follow the initial contours of the cuboids (Figure S14). The atoms that have diffused from adjacent Pb
nanoparticles could gather and form clusters (see Figure S15). This process is similar to the reported dissipation
of Pd and Mo nanoparticles through diffusion under electron beam irradiation.35 Therefore, if we rule out the possibility of
vaporization and redox reactions, the most probable mechanism for
the “disappearance” of Pb nanoparticles under prolonged
electron irradiation is through diffusion and spreading out of Pb
atoms on the remaining perovskite lattice and on the carbon film of
the TEM grid.

To summarize the above-presented results, the
overall process of
electron beam-induced transformations in CsPbBr3 NCs is
schematically summarized in Figure 7. For demonstration purposes, we show the evolution
of Pb nanoparticles in an irradiated area, and we draw only the topmost
PbBr6 octahedron layer. Considering that, in the CsPbBr3 structure, mainly covalent bonds form between Pb and Br,
and mainly ionic bonds form between Cs and Br, while Pb and Cs atoms
are not bound to each other,36 the following
stages can be identified on the basis of the above results:

Figure 7 Schematics
depicting the stages in the evolution of an irradiated
area in a CsPbBr3 nanosheet ([001] orientation). Only the
atomic model for the topmost layer of PbBr6 octahedra is
shown for clarity.

Stage 1.
The whole process starts with the oxidation
of Br– and reduction of Pb2+ at all studied
temperatures (Figures 1 and Figure S1), which is likely to occur
preferentially at the corners and edges of the surface of the NC.
Oxidized halide species desorb from the surface.

Stage
2. At high temperatures (above −40 °C),
in tandem with electron induced motion (i.e., by
momentum transfer), the reduced Pb0 atoms diffuse preferentially
along the surface and aggregate into single-crystal Pb nanoparticles,
which possess anisotropic shapes and epitaxial relationships with
the parent nanosheet lattice, probably due to partial binding to the
surrounding lattice. Note that a higher temperature (above 60 °C)
can enable the diffusion of Pb0 also from the inner perovskite
lattice.

Stage 3. The bonds between the early Pb
nanoparticles
and the parent CsPbBr3 NCs are broken upon further irradiation,
hence the Pb nanoparticles evolve toward more isotropic shapes, giving
rise to voids. The Pb particles are located at the boundary between
the voids and the remaining perovskite lattice (as shown in Figures 2 and 6).

Stage 4. Upon further electron irradiation,
the Pb
nanoparticles amorphize, then they become smaller and finally fade
as the Pb atoms spread on the remains of the CsPbBr3 surface
or on the support film.

Conclusions
The experiments presented
here demonstrate that the electron beam
induced nucleation of Pb nanoparticles on CsPbX3 NCs is
mainly due to a radiolysis damage process. Electron irradiation (80
keV/200 keV) induces the desorption of halogen atoms from the surface
of the NCs and the reduction of Pb2+ to metallic Pb0, in analogy with the electron stimulated desorption mechanism
reported in the literature. This process also occurs under other types
of irradiation, such as X-rays. Subsequently, adjacent Pb0 atoms diffuse and aggregate into Pb nanoparticles at a temperature
dependent rate, which is simultaneously aided by electron irradiation,
most probably due to electron beam-induced motion via knock-on displacement of the Pb0 atoms on the surface.
At temperatures high enough for diffusion to occur, on CsPbBr3 NCs, anisotropic Pb nanoparticles epitaxially oriented and
bound to the parent structure are produced. These rearrange into more
spherical particles under further irradiation, after the bonds between
their edge atoms and the surrounding parent CsPbBr3 NCs
are broken. The nucleated Pb nanoparticles are unstable and are dismantled
under further electron irradiation. The formation of Pb nanoparticles
preferentially occurs at the corners and edges of the surface of the
NCs. In this context, CsPbBr3 NCs with higher surface-to-volume
ratio are prone to decompose by electron beam-induced Pb nanoparticles
formation, while lower surface-to-volume ratio CsPbBr3 NCs
are more robust. We could also safely exclude any significant electron
beam heating under our experimental conditions.

The mechanism
presented in this study may also govern the formation
of high contrast particles observed in TEM images of hybrid lead halide
perovskite NCs,37 tin halide perovskite
NCs,38 and other perovskite related materials
such as CsPb2Br5,39 and it helps defining some precautions to follow. When dealing with
halide perovskites characterization using electron microscopy, increasing
the incident electron energy of the microscope can largely improve
the stability of the sample. By lowering the substrate temperature,
the characterization of high aspect ratio perovskite NCs becomes feasible
as a consequence of the retarded decomposition process. Besides, radiation
induced damage may be exploited for patterning purposes, i.e., by creating Br-rich and Br-deficient areas, or for selectively
inducing anion exchange in different regions, to enable patterned
luminescent surfaces, where each pixel in the display device should
correspond to the whole irradiated area, in order to avoid the inhomogeneity
caused by the electron beam. Besides, in principle the Pb formation
process can be used to make porous perovskite NCs. These can be advantageous
compared to nonporous perovskite NCs in sensing applications, because
the analytes can penetrate into the pores and interact more strongly
with the perovskite. Another potential application is to enable a
cation exchange process with the aid of the Pb2+ reduction
under electron irradiation to produce a shell of perovskite with another
element on the surface, as a route toward fabricating core–shell
perovskite NCs.

Methods
Electron Beam
Irradiation in the TEM
The electron beam
irradiation experiments were carried out in a 200 kV microscope (JEOL
JEM-2200FS) equipped with a spherical aberration corrector (CEOS)
for the objective lens and an in-column image filter (Ω-type).
The acceleration voltage can be lowered to 80 kV by means of an electric
short switch. The base pressure in the TEM column was 2 × 10–7 mbar.

High Resolution TEM (HRTEM)
The
electron dose is reported
for each HRTEM image. The images were acquired with two types of detectors:
a CCD camera with 2048 × 2048 pixels (UltraScan 1000, Gatan Inc.),
and a direct electron detection camera (K2 Summit, Gatan Inc.), with
7420 × 7676 pixels in super-resolution mode. The K2 camera is
able to capture images on a large field of view with atomic resolution,
while minimizing electron exposure. The HRTEM images were acquired
with the K2 camera unless specified.

Probe Current Measurements
We first calibrated the
electron counts on the CCD camera using the direct electron detection
camera for which electron number is directly counted. Then the probe
current was measured by acquiring
the Scanning TEM (STEM) probe on UltraScan 1000. With a spot size
of 1.5 nm and convergence semiangle of 16 mrad, the resulting probe
current was 68 pA (corresponding to a current density of 3.8 ×
103 A/cm2) and was varied by selecting the spot
size.

High Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF-STEM) and Energy Dispersive
X-ray Spectrometry (EDS) Analysis
A Bruker Quantax 400 EDS
system with an XFlash 5060 detector was used for elemental analysis.
The NCs composition was estimated from the EDS spectra in the thin
film approximation (Cliff-Lorimer) by fitting the Cs Lα, Pb
Lα and Br Kα lines, with a relative error of 10% for Cs,
10% for Pb, 4% for Br, evaluated as the standard deviation in the
fit.

Temperature Dependent Study
A JEOL EM-21130 specimen
heating holder with an electric furnace and EM-SHU2 heater control
was used for observing the effect of higher temperatures on electron
beam-induced transformations in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. A
Gatan cryotransfer holder with liquid nitrogen cooling equipped with
a Model 900 Smartset cold stage controller was used for observing
the electron beam-induced transformation at low temperatures.

X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
A Kratos Axis
Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source
(photon energy = 1486.6 eV) was used for irradiation and characterization.
Nanosheets were exposed to continuous X-ray exposure at a photon flux
of 2.4 × 1011 photons/mm2 s. High-resolution
spectra were acquired with an analyzer pass energy of 10 eV and steps
of 0.1 eV. The pressure in the chamber was kept below 10–8 mbar and the takeoff angle set at Φ = 0°. Energy calibration
was performed fixing the C–C component of C 1s spectrum at
284.8 eV. Relative atomic percentages of different species were computed
from high-resolution spectra, fitted with Voigt functions using CasaXPS
software.

Synthesis of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals
Thin,
rectangular shaped nanosheets around 3 nm thick, with lateral size
of several 100 nm up to few μm were synthesized by a colloidal
procedure reported elsewhere.14 CsPbBr3 nanowires with rectangular cross section were synthesized
by a colloidal procedure previously reported by us.15 CsPbBr3 nanocuboids with 8 nm edge were synthesized
by a colloidal procedure similar to the one reported previously.6 The CsPbBr3 nanocuboids with edge
length of 20–40 nm were synthesized following the same colloidal
procedure as for CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets, except that ethanol
was used in the place of acetone.13 The
TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting 10 μL of the colloidal
suspensions onto ultrathin carbon/holey carbon coated Cu grids.

Calculation of Pb0 Atoms in the Pb Nanoparticles
The total number of Pb0 atoms contained in Pb nanoparticles
was estimated as follows: the total area of the Pb nanoparticles in
the HAADF-STEM images was measured in ImageJ,40 and then the total volume of Pb nanoparticles was calculated and
multiplied by the atomic density of crystalline Pb to give the total
number of Pb0 atoms.
