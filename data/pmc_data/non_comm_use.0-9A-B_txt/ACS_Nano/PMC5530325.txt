Glasses formed from
nano- and microparticles form a fascinating
testing ground to explore and understand the origins of vitrification.
For atomic and molecular glasses, a wide range of fragilities have
been observed; in colloidal systems, these effects can be emulated
by adjusting the particle softness. The colloidal glass transition
can range from a superexponential, fragile increase in viscosity with
increasing density for hard spheres to a strong, Arrhenius-like transition
for compressible particles. However, the microscopic origin of fragility
and strength remains elusive, both in the colloidal and in the atomic
domains. Here, we propose a simple model that explains fragility changes
in colloidal glasses by describing the volume regulation of compressible
colloids in order to maintain osmotic equilibrium. Our simple model
provides a microscopic explanation for fragility, and we show that
it can describe experimental data for a variety of soft colloidal
systems, ranging from microgels to star polymers and proteins. Our
results highlight that the elastic energy per particle acts as an
effective fragility order parameter, leading to a universal description
of the colloidal glass transition.

Suspensions
of colloidal hard
spheres vitrify when the particle volume fraction ϕ is increased
beyond the colloidal glass transition, often identified to occur at
ϕg ≈ 0.59.1,2 Upon approaching
the glass transition, the structural relaxation time of the suspension
τ grows rapidly, and fingerprints of the glassy state emerge,
such as heterogeneous dynamics,3−5 long-lived local structures,6,7 and percolating networks of mechanically bonded neighbors.8,9 Mode-coupling theory (MCT)10 has been
successfully used to demarcate the transition from freely flowing
fluid to a glassy state at ϕg. On the other hand,
experiments suggest that this colloidal glass transition does not
involve ergodicity breaking as predicted by MCT, but that this occurs
only at slightly higher volume fractions.11

For molecular and polymeric glasses, Angell proposed a classification
scheme depending on how steeply the liquid viscosity η rises
as the glass transition temperature Tg is approached.12 When η shows a
very steep, superexponential increase with T/Tg, the glass is denoted as “fragile”.
By contrast, when η grows more gradually, following an exponential
Arrhenius law, the glass is classified as “strong”.
In other words, in a fragile glass former, even small changes in temperature
can have dramatic effects on the liquid viscosity; the viscosity is
more robust to small temperature fluctuations in a strong glass.

In suspensions of nanoparticles or colloids, the phase behavior
of the system is governed by the volume fraction rather than temperature.
For hard spheres, the structural relaxation time τ, which is
proportional to the suspension viscosity, rises superexponentially
as the volume fraction approaches its glass transition point ϕg. As a result, the hard-sphere glass can be classified as
fragile, in analogy with the concept of fragility and strength for
glasses formed by atomic, molecular, or polymeric building blocks.12

Also, soft and compressible particles,
such as microgels,13−15 star polymers,16,17 and even globular proteins18,19 and cells,20,21 exhibit a glass transition when
their packing fraction approaches a critical value. However, for many
of these soft systems, the fragile transition gradually gives way
to a much weaker and exponential growth of the relaxation time τ
∝ eϕ/ϕg,13,20 resembling strong Arrhenius glasses in the molecular realm.12 In particular, for sufficiently soft microgels,
ultrasoft polymer stars, and suspensions of cells, a pure Arrhenius
behavior has been observed experimentally.13,16,17,20

This
raises the intriguing possibility that the entire range of
fragility and strength known to exist for molecular systems may be
explored by studying glasses of colloids with varying softness. For
example, for microgel suspensions, it has been demonstrated that a
transition from fragile to strong glass forming behavior could be
induced solely by changing the elasticity of the individual particles.
Clearly, a connection must exist between the elasticity at the scale
of a single particle and the nature of the glass transition at the
macroscopic scale. For metallic glasses, such a connection was recently
established quantitatively in which the “softness” of
the interatomic repulsions acts as a tuning fork for fragility.22,23 However, such a framework does not yet exist for glasses formed
from nanoparticles and colloids. As a result, a universal description
of the glass transition that explains the origins of fragility and
strength has to date remained unavailable.

In this paper, we
propose a description for the microscopic mechanism
of fragility transitions in glasses of compressible colloids, based
on the regulation of osmotic equilibrium. Using a simple phenomenological
model, we show how apparent changes in fragility can arise when the
particle softness is varied. We find that the elastic energy per particle
acts as an effective order parameter for the fragility of the glass
transition. A qualitative comparison of our model with experimental
data suggests that a fragile-to-strong transition can be induced not
only by increasing particle softness but also by decreasing the particle
size. Our results provide a framework to explain the underlying mechanisms
that control the nature of the glass transition in a variety of colloidal
systems.

Theoretical Framework
In most experiments with purely
repulsive colloidal suspensions,
the phase behavior is controlled by the particle volume fraction ϕ.
For hard and incompressible colloids, the state parameter is unambiguously
defined as , where n is the number
concentration of particles with radius a. For compressible
particles, however, defining the real particle volume fraction is
more difficult. As n increases, the osmotic pressure
of the bath, comprising all particles immersed in their solvent, grows.
To maintain osmotic equilibrium, compressible particles, which are
equilibrated with their surroundings, must increase the pressure in
the particle interior. This is accomplished by their deswelling, which
increases the internal osmotic pressure of the polymer network.

Due to this osmotic equilibrium, the volume of compressible particles
is not constant but becomes a function of n, and
as such, the linear relation between number density and volume fraction
is lost. The osmotic deswelling of individual compressible nano- and
microparticles has been studied in detail previously.24−29

In experiments on microgels, the particle volume fraction
is typically
measured in dilute conditions and extrapolated to the concentrated
regime. This extrapolated packing fraction, which is the experimental
control parameter being used, is defined as , with a0 the
particle size at infinite dilution ϕ → 0.

Notably,
ζ is linear in n but not in ϕ;30 for highly compressible particles, such as soft
microgels, ζ may thus increase well beyond unity when a ≪ a0. Due to the nonlinearity
between ζ and ϕ, this discrepancy cannot be resolved by
normalizing ζ to a characteristic state point in the particle
phase diagram, for example, the freezing point or glass transition.

To resolve this, we propose a simple qualitative model that accounts
for osmotic shrinkage of compressible particles upon approaching their
glass transition. Previously, osmotic shrinkage of compressible spheres
has been postulated to lead to the lack of a glassy state all together,31 but a direct link to changes in glass fragility
has not been established.

We model colloidal spheres, with equilibrium
radius a (ϕ → 0) = a0, where the
internal volume fraction of osmolyte ϕp = ϕp,0. For example for microgel colloids, or polymer stars, ϕp represents the volume fraction of polymer segments within
the particle. The microscopic details of the internal equation-of-state,
which governs the balance between osmotic and elastic pressure within
a particle, Πin, vary greatly among different experimental
systems. Yet, all systems in osmotic equilibrium with a bath of pure
solvent must satisfy Πin(ϕp,0) ≡
0. For microgels, this is achieved by balancing a positive contribution
to the internal pressure due to mixing of chains and solvent with
a negative contribution resulting from entropic chain elasticity,
commonly expressed within the Flory–Rehner theory for gels.32

Rather than using a microscopic theory,
such as the Flory–Rehner
theory for hydrogels or the elastic description of single-particle
micromechanics proposed recently by Riest et al.,29 to describe a specific type of compressible
spheres, here, we start with a phenomenological description of the
internal equation-of-state at a qualitative level such that analytical
results can be obtained. The aim of this paper is to arrive at a conceptual
understanding of fragility in compressible sphere packings; of course,
for specific systems, a more quantitative description can be derived
if the internal equation-of-state and that of the suspension bath
are known a priori.

Here, we use a phenomenological
form for the sake of simplicity,
inspired by the mean-field description of polymers in the marginal
(i.e., theta-solvent conditions) and semidilute regime
Π ∝ ϕp2.33 Given the additional constraint
that Πin must be equal to the external pressure at
equilibrium, which is zero for very dilute suspensions, we use the
functional form 1  where k is an effective stiffness
of the particles. We note that this can be easily changed to good
solvent conditions by changing to a power of 9/4 instead of 2. Since
ϕp/ϕp,0 = a03/a3, the internal pressure can be rewritten as 2  As the overal
particle concentration n increases, a significant
colloidal osmotic pressure Πout will develop in the
bath, which we describe with the empirical
equation-of-state proposed by Speedy:34 3  in
which kBT is the thermal
energy and s1 and s2 are numerical constants. For
hard spheres, it can be parametrized with s1 ≈ 2.55 and s2 = 1/ϕrcp ≈ 1.55, in which ϕrcp is the random
close packing fraction. Here, we choose this description for the equation-of-state
of the bath as it describes the pressure at finite volume fractions
reasonably well and its simple form allows solving the equations analytically.
The Speedy equation-of-state does not accurately represent the limit
of ϕ → 0; however, this limit is not considered in the
present work, hence we do not pursue this point further. The underlying
assumption in choosing this form is that in the limit of full deswelling
of the particles, when ϕp → 1 and all solvent
is expelled from the particle interior, the initially soft particles
become incompressible, which must lead to a divergence of the bath
pressure. Moreover, this implies that at equilibrium, the bulk modulus K of the particles must be a function of its degree of deswelling.
Within our approximate and phenomenological approach, the bulk modulus
of the particles is indeed density-dependent and can be defined as K = ϕpdΠin/dϕp = 2kϕp2. We note
that, also here, for a quantitative description, the bath equation-of-state
of the specific system must be known; for example, in experiments
on microgels, such as those revealing the fragility transitions with
softness,13 charged residues on the particles
will significantly alter the magnitude of the bath osmotic pressure.
In fact, it is the ratio of the intrinsic particle softness k to the bath pressure that governs the behavior.

Using ϕ = a3ζ/a03, we find 4  At each ζ, a new equilibrium
is established
by reducing the particle size a < a0, simultaneously increasing Πin and
reducing the bath pressure until Πin = Πout. With 5  and 6  we can define the equilibrium condition as 7  which gives direct access to the relationship
between number density and volume fraction. Interestingly, the extent
to which osmotic balance creates a nonlinearity between ϕ and
ζ is governed solely by the normalized elastic energy per particle k̅a03/kBT, with k̅ = kϕp,02 the intrinsic particle elasticity.
The elastic energy per particle is directly coupled to the external
equation-of-state because 3s1/4πs2A = k̅a03/kBT, such that “softness”
can be defined as the relative resistance to volume changes of the
particles as compared to how steep the osmotic pressure in the bath
grows with ϕ.

In the limit of very soft particles, k̅a03 ≪ kBT, so that osmotic shrinkage
is strong λ ≪ 1. In this limit, eq 7 is approximated as 8  which yields 9  At high number densities, ζ
≫ A, this leads to λ ≈ 1/s2ζ. With ϕ = ζλ, we
find ϕ ≈
1/s2 = ϕrcp. This implies
that for very soft particles at sufficiently high number concentrations,
the system equilibrates at random close packing; addition of more
particles results in a proportional isotropic compression of the system
such that the volume fraction remains constant; this could explain
the lack of a glassy state in certain cases.31 We finally note that in this derivation we assume that the particles
respond to increasing particle density by osmotic deswelling only,
and thus that particle deformation can be ignored. This implies that
the particles we describe have a Poisson’s ratio ν <
0.5, which is a reasonable assumption for hydrogel systems under the
appropriate conditions.35

Results and Discussion
We first evaluate the effect of particle softness, regulated by k, on the relationship between real volume fraction ϕ
and extrapolated packing parameter ζ. For small colloids, a0 = 50 nm, a significant bath pressure develops
already at moderate volume fractions. When the particles are stiff,
the hard-sphere limit k̅ = ∞ is approached
for which ϕ ≡ ζ (dotted line Figure 1a). When the effective particle elasticity
is reduced, and osmotic regulation effects become pronounced, the
nonlinearity between ζ and the real volume fraction ϕ
grows. The corresponding osmotic shrinkage of the particles, expressed
here by the deswelling ratio a/a0, as shown in Figure 1b, can be very strong for the softest particles, with
actual radii a(ϕ) more than a factor of 3 smaller
than their fully swollen dimension a0,
at reasonable volume fractions; this is in direct agreement with experiments
on microgel particles.30,36

To explore the implications
this pronounced osmotic shrinkage has
on the apparent fragility of the glass transition, we adopt the ansatz
that structural relaxation slows down universally with ϕ below
the ideal mode-coupling glass transition. The structural relaxation
time, normalized to the characteristic time of unhindered Brownian
diffusion, τ/τ0 is thus assumed to be described
by a single equation as a function of ϕ. To this end, we use
an equivalent of the classical VFT equation in which particle volume
fraction governs the dynamics:11,37 10  where C is a numerical constant
and ϕc is a critical volume fraction at which the
system becomes non-ergodic. According to extensive light scattering
experiments on colloidal hard spheres,11 the point of ergodicity breaking lies above the MCT glass transition
ϕc > ϕg. For the purposes of
this
article, we parametrize the VFT law by fitting it to experimental
data for hard spheres (k̅ ≈ ∞)
as reported by Brambilla et al.(11) (symbols Figure 2); these experimental data are well fitted by C = 0.7 and ϕc = 0.625 (dotted line Figure 2).

Having expressions for both τ(ϕ)
and ϕ(ζ),
we can now explore how suspensions of compressible colloids vitrify
by reconstructing τ(ζ), which is typically measured in
experiments. Our simple model qualitatively reproduces the results
observed experimentally for microgel colloids,13 where τ/τ0 grows more slowly for
softer particles, and extrapolated packing fractions of well over
unity are required to reach the glassy state (Figure 2a).

To evaluate the fragility of these
predicted glass transitions,
we first define the glass transition as the packing fraction where
τ/τ0 ≡ 105, following Mattsson et al.(13) For the hard-sphere
data of Brambilla et al.,11 this yields ϕg ≈ 0.59, in agreement with
MCT predictions and experimental findings.2,10 Having
defined ϕg, we can replot our predictions in the
Angell representation,12,38 where the relaxation time is
plotted as a function of the rescaled packing fraction ζ/ζg; indeed, our model reproduces the experimentally observed
fragility transition13 with decreasing k̅ (Figure 2b).

One may wonder if the observed fragility change
as a function of
particle softness is a robust feature of any system which features
osmotic regulation, many of which will have a different form of their
internal or external equation-of-state as compared to the choices
above. For example, we can argue that close to their equilibrium size a0, for small degrees of deswelling a/a0 ≈ 1, the free energy of a
single compressible particle may be considered to be parabolic: ΔG = κ(a – a0)2, in which κ is the spring constant,
a related measure for the particle softness as compared to k, but with different dimensions. Since Πin = −dΔG/dV and the
particle volume , we have 11  Also for this
form of the internal pressure,
using the Speedy equation-of-state for the bath, we can predict how
the relaxation time grows with ζ. We solve these equations numerically
and find that also for this different shape of the internal equation-of-state,
a fragile-to-strong transition emerges upon changing the spring constant
κ (Figure 2c).
This highlights how the conceptual idea that osmotic equilibrium governs
the fragility of the colloidal glass transition is not sensitive to
the exact choice for the internal pressure. It is interesting to note
that the “strong” limit of our model does not produce
a true Arrhenius curve, as some curvature remains at low values of
ζ where the effects of osmotic regulation are weak and the inherent
curvature in τ(ϕ) of the VFT equation remains. Thus, the
analogy with Arrhenius behavior is only an apparent one and not truly
reflective of a pure exponential decay of relaxation rates with ζ/ζg.

For certain specific soft sphere systems, more precise
and microscopic
descriptions of the internal equation-of-state exist. One particular
example is the Flory–Rehner swelling theory that describes
the internal pressure of uncharged microgel particles as a balance
between a mixing term to promote swelling and the entropic elasticity
of the polymer segments between cross-links that counteracts swelling.
Within this framework, the internal equation-of-state can be written
as39 12  which
is governed by microscopic properties,
such as the monomer dimension lk, the solvent–polymer interaction parameter χ,
and the polymer volume fraction of the collapsed particle ϕp,c where the elastic contribution to the internal pressure
vanishes. Softness is controlled by the cross-linking density, which
determines the number of monomer repeat units between cross-links Nx, which is thus an inverse
softness parameter within this model. Aiming to describe for example
pNIPAM microgels, we choose lk = 1 nm, ϕp,c = 0.5, and good solvency such
that χ = 0. Indeed, also for this microscopic internal equation-of-state,
an apparent fragility transition emerges upon changing the cross-linking
density Nx (Figure 2d). We note that
the values of Nx required
to induce fragility changes are somewhat higher than those expected
in experiments;13 we attribute this to
the fact that we assume a hard-sphere equation-of-state for the bath,
whereas these experiments worked with partially charged microgels,
in which the bath pressure rises much more steeply, thus resulting
in effectively softer particles, as discussed in more detail below.
Finally, we observe that the exact line shape of τ versus ζ/ζg differs depending on the choice of the
internal equation-of-state. This may hold the promise of deducing
the internal equation-of-state of compressible particles from high-resolution
measurements of the structural relaxation time and to quantify their
softness directly.

To further validate the predictions of our
model, we collect published
data for particle self-diffusion in a variety of systems composed
of compressible spherical objects, ranging from microgels of different
softness,13,40 star polymers,37 and globular proteins41 (symbols in Figure 3). Whereas the microscopic
mechanisms with which osmotic equilibrium is regulated differ between
these systems, as does the exact form of the equation-of-state, we
fit all these data with the analytical form of our model (eqs 5–7). As a0 is known from the experiments,
this leaves k̅ as the only adjustable parameter.
We note explicitly that a comparison of the absolute values of k̅ are meaningless because the underlying equations-of-state
for these different systems are not the same; hence, the value of k̅ needed to fit the data is the effective softness
of these particles with the Speedy equation-of-state as an internal
standard.

Nonetheless, the line shape and entire range of
experimentally
observed fragilities in these soft colloidal systems can be qualitatively
reproduced with a simple phenomenological model (drawn lines Figure 3a). This highlights
how fragility transitions in colloidal systems can be the direct result
of osmotic regulation of particle size, providing a mechanism of feedback
between number density, particle size, and thus volume fraction and
the macroscopic structural relaxation time. This provides a theoretical
foundation to the idea put forth by Mattsson et al. that the fragility changes in microgel suspensions are directly
related to local elasticity.13 Above we
have shown how the steepness with which the structural relaxations
slow down as the particle concentration is increased are governed
by the parameter k̅a03. This implies that not only the particle
softness, expressed by k̅, but also the particle
size has an effect on the fragility of the glass. In other words,
hard colloids may make strong glasses if the particles are small enough,
and soft colloids may make fragile glasses if they are sufficiently
large. To make this idea more quantitative, we can compute the kinetic
fragility index from the data for τ(ζ) as 13  We note that this is an approximation
to the
kinetic fragility index that is defined as the local slope of the
viscosity with temperature in atomic and molecular glass formers.
While a more proper analogy would use the pressure rather than packing
fraction,42 this is experimentally intractable
and beyond the scope of this paper. Thus, to allow for a comparison
to experimental data, we use the slope of relaxation time versus packing fraction as a proxy for the kinetic fragility
index of the colloidal glass.

The lower limit of m, for strong glasses that
exhibit ideal Arrhenius behavior, is set at m = 5,
by our definition of the glass transition at log(τ/τ0) = 5. At the other extreme, we have the hard-sphere glass
transition, as the most fragile case of fully incompressible particles,
which has m ≈ 37 based on experimental data.11

Interestingly, when the elastic energy
per particle is k̅a03 ≪ kBT, osmotic shrinkage is pronounced, which results
in strong glasses,
such as for the softest microgels (Figure 3b). When k̅a03 becomes of the
order of the thermal energy, the intrinsic particle elasticity effectively
competes with the pressure which develops in the bath, and the transition
becomes increasingly fragile until the hard-sphere limit is reached
when k̅a03 ≫ kBT (Figure 3b). The bulk elastic energy per particle thus acts as an order parameter
for the fragility of the colloidal glass transition. Indeed, the experimental
data can be collapsed onto the predicted relation between the fragility
index m and the normalized particle elasticity when
the experimentally determined fragility is plotted against k̅a0/kBT, with k̅ determined from the fits
shown in Figure 3a
and a0 taken from the experimental publications
as indicated in the figure caption.

Our phenomenological model
does not take the microscopic origins
of internal and external pressures into account. For example, the
Speedy equation-of-state is only valid for particles interacting by
volume exclusion alone. Additional contributions, for example, due
to charges, will affect the osmotic balance both inside the particles
and in the bath. This can have significant effects on the phase behavior
of soft particle suspensions, for example, leading to the absence
of a solid phase in fully ionic microgels even at very high densities.31,43 For a comprehensive description of the swelling behavior of ionic
microgels, which accounts for both polymeric and ionic terms, we refer
to Colla et al.(44)

To illustrate the effects of charges, we start from published experimental
data for strongly cross-linked microgels, for systems that are highly
charged36 and microgels that carry a small
amount of charges due to the ionic initiator used during particle
synthesis.13,40 As no experimental data are available
for microgels that carry absolutely zero charges, we synthesize polystyrene
microgels using a nonionic initiator resulting in particles free of
ionic groups45 (see also the Materials and Methods section). These particles are suspended
in a mixture of bromo- and iodobenzene, which is a good solvent for
the polystyrene gel network and matches their refractive index. We
determine the structural relaxation of suspensions of these uncharged
microgels with dynamic light scattering (DLS), as a function of ζ,
which is determined by capillary viscosimetry in the dilute limit.

With increasing particle concentration, the autocorrelation curves g2(t) – 1 obtained from
DLS experiments show both the slowing down of particle diffusion and
the emergence of a plateau at intermediate times, indicative of the
formation of repulsive cages which hinder particle motion (Figure 3c). These data are
consistent with DLS experiments on aqueous, and slightly charged,
microgels.13,40 We note that at very long lag
times t > 500 s, a lack of statistics, due to
the
experimental aqcuisition time, leads to an artifical superexponential
decay of the correlation function. Nonetheless, the data clearly show
the glass transition as the particle concentration is increased. We
do not use the data beyond >500 s to extract the characteristic
structural
relaxation time such that this does not effect our results. For these
uncharged microgels, the glass transition is very fragile and virtually
traces the hard-sphere line with m = 37 (Figure 3d). For the weakly
charged microgels, a small decrease in fragility can be seen, whereas
a nearly exponential Arrhenius behavior results for highly charged
microgels (Figure 3d). This, surprisingly, suggests that a high concentration of charges,
which increases the internal osmotic pressure and thus provides additional
resistance to deswelling, effectively “softens” the
particles by reducing the effective value of k̅a03 required
to describe the vitrification with our phenomenological model (lines Figure 3d).

The counterintuitive
observation that charged microgels act “softer”
than uncharged particles at the same cross-linking density is in agreement
with the observation that the osmotic deswelling of ionic microgels
can be so severe that the volume fraction at which a liquid–solid
transition must occur is not reached, even at exceedingly high values
of the extrapolated packing fraction ζ > 35.31,43 This emergent softness was attributed to the high osmotic pressure
of the bath, governed by mobile ions unbound to the microgel particles,46 which result in strong compression of the particles
as the solid–liquid transition is approached. This argument,
and its experimental proof,31 underpins
the concept we have raised above, that rather than particle softness
alone, as hypothesized previously,13 it
is in fact the balance between the osmotic pressure of the bath and
the intrinsic softness of the particle that governs the solid–liquid
transition and its fragility. Even when the single-particle mechanics
indicate a relatively high bulk modulus, if the bath osmotic pressure
is high enough, for example, due to the presence of ions or for sufficiently
small particles, osmotic deswelling may be significant, resulting
in a strong rather than a fragile glass. The unusually strong deswelling
of ionic microgels furthermore leads to unexpected behavior, such
as the strong shrinkage of large microgels in a crystal of smaller
particles to accommodate to the lattice and minimize the energy penalty
associated with defect formation.47,48

Conclusion
We have presented a simple model, based on the osmotic deswelling
of compressible colloids, which qualitatively captures fragility changes
observed in colloidal glasses. The change from a fragile to a strong
glass transition can be explained by a nonlinear relation between
the experimental control parameter ζ and the real particle volume
fraction which dictates the dynamics of the suspension. The degree
of nonlinearity depends only on the elastic energy per particle, which
thus serves as an effective order parameter for fragility. As the
elastic energy per particle scales inversely with particle volume,
hard colloids may make strong glasses and soft colloids may make fragile
glasses depending on nominal particle size, the particle softness,
and the equation-of-state of the bath. While the phenomenological
description we present provides new insight into the nature of the
colloidal glass transition at the macroscopic scale, it does not yet
account for spatial heterogeneity at microscopic length scales. Experiments
and simulations have shown that softness reduces both the magnitude
and spatial extent of dynamical heterogeneities49 and extends the validity range of the Stokes–Einstein
relation to higher packing densities.50,51 Perhaps this
can be explained by the weaker dependence of relaxation time on local
density for softer particles due to osmotic regulation. Extending
the simple model proposed here to account for such local effects could
aid in elucidating the intriguing connection between glass fragility
and dynamical heterogeneity.52−54

a method described
in detail elsewhere.45 Briefly, we dissolved
2 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate in 320 mL of deionized water in a round-bottom
flask. Separately, we prepared a solution of 96 g of styrene, 6 g
of the cross-linker divinylbenzene, 5 mL of hexadecane, and 1 g of
the radical initiator 2,2-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile). We mixed
the aqueous and monomer phase and first created a coarse pre-emulsion
by using a high-shear rotor-stator mixer. We subsequently formed a
stable mini-emulsion using high-intensity ultrasonication. After purging
the reaction flask with nitrogen, we allowed the mixture to react
overnight at 65 °C. The microgel particles were purified by precipitation
in cold methanol, filtration, and drying in vacuo, followed by resuspension
in THF and precipitation in methanol. This is repeated three times
to ensure complete removal of surfactant and reaction byproducts.
Finally, we resuspend the microgels in THF to swell the microgels
completely, which allows any linear polystyrene to diffuse out of
the microgels, which we remove by centrifugation at 30 000g and removal of the supernatant. This was repeated three
times to ensure complete removal of all linear polystyrene as confirmed
by gel permeation chromatography. We then dried the microgels in vacuo. The resulting particles have a hydrodynamic radius
in the dilute limit of a0 = 93 nm, measured
in the index-matching solvent.

Samples were prepared by suspending
a known weight of dried microgels
in an index-matching mixture of iodobenze and bromobenzene (70:30
by volume). Samples were mixed extensively by vortexing and repeated
centrifugation for the most viscous samples; in all cases, the sample
was centrifuged at 1500g in the sample tube prior
to measurement to remove any air bubbles and dust from the scattering
volume. Samples were equilibrated for at least 1 h in the thermostated
sample bath at 21 °C to ensure a homogeneous temperature within
the sample. Measurements were performed using a DLS setup based on
an ALV/CGS-3 goniometer, equipped with an avalanche photon detector,
633 nm diode laser (JDSU) and dual ALV LSE-5004 hardware correlators
for cross-correlation. All measurements were performed at a scattering
angle of 150°, which gives a scattering vector  nm–1. We note that to
measure true self-diffusion, measurements should be performed at scattering
vectors qa ≤ 2π, with a being the particle radius. For the polystyrene microgels we study
here, this implies a minimum scattering vector of  nm–1, which
is not attainable
in this setup. Because our scattering vector was below this value,
we probed dynamics on somewhat larger characteristic length scales,
which we took as a measure of the sample’s viscosity or long-time
particle self-diffusivity.
