In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
electronic transport measurements in nanoscale systems have been previously
confined to two-electrode configurations. Here, we use the focused
electron beam of a TEM to fabricate a three-electrode geometry from
a continuous 2D material where the third electrode operates as side
gate in a field-effect transistor configuration. Specifically, we
demonstrate TEM nanosculpting of freestanding graphene sheets into
graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with proximal graphene side gates, together
with in situ TEM transport measurements of the resulting
GNRs, whose conductance is modulated by the side-gate potential. The
TEM electron beam displaces carbon atoms from the graphene sheet,
and its position is controlled with nanometer precision, allowing
the fabrication of GNRs of desired width immediately prior to each
transport measurement. We also model the corresponding electric field
profile in this three-terminal geometry. The implementation of an in situ TEM three-terminal platform shown here further extends
the use of a TEM for device characterization. This approach can be
easily generalized for the investigation of other nanoscale systems
(2D materials, nanowires, and single molecules) requiring the correlation
of transport and atomic structure.

==== Body
Growing interest
in performing in situ TEM electronic transport measurements
is motivated
by the need to understand transport in devices that keep shrinking
in size and by a surge of specialized TEM sample holders allowing
such measurements. The concept of in situ measurements
is particularly attractive because standard TEMs offer a unique combination
of materials-characterization techniques (high-resolution imaging,
electron diffraction, electron-based spectroscopy, etc.) that can be used concurrently to correlate a material’s
structure and chemistry—down to the atomic scale—with
its electronic properties. However, in situ TEM transport
measurements have been confined to two-electrode configurations, by
using either two static electrodes or a movable scanning probe tip
operating as an electrode. Examples include measurements of chains
of Au atoms;1−3 C4−6 and BN tubes;7,8 Si,9 Ge2Sb2Te5,10 and MoSe wires;11 CNT–metal junctions;12 graphene
constrictions13−15 and ribbons;16−18 atomic C chains;19 and nanobatteries.20,21 Modulating the conductance
in some of these nanoscale systems by tuning the charge carrier density
requires addition of a third electrode: the gate electrode in a field-effect
transistor (FET) configuration.

In this Article, we describe
the implementation of a three-terminal
transport platform inside the TEM, extending its use beyond two-terminal in situ characterizations. Specifically, we present the
steps to achieve in situ TEM fabrication of a three-electrode
graphene device nanosculpted from a continuous graphene sheet, with
one graphene electrode operating as a side gate, to perform in situ TEM transport measurements in a freestanding graphene
nanoribbon (GNR) serving as a FET channel. The top- or bottom-gate
configuration typically used to modulate the charge charrier density
in a FET channel is incompatible with in situ TEM
transport studies, where the goal is to image and fabricate the channel
with the electron beam. For these types of studies, the side-gate
configuration offers a valid alternative by removing the gate from
the path of the electron beam, which then can be used to image and
modify the channel via beam-induced modifications
without interruption. In the side-gate configuration the coupling
between gate and channel is weaker than in the top/bottom-gate configuration
but, as we show here, sufficiently large to modulate the electronic
properties of a GNR FET channel. In summary, this three-terminal device
design enables the simultaneous characterization of the channel’s
structural, chemical, and transport properties within the TEM column
(Figure 1a).

a GNR. The electron beam is shown focused, as in the STEM mode. (b)

are visible on top of the SiNx film. The
distance between the gate extension carved from graphene and the GNR

circuit. (c) Color plot of GNR conductance showing transport modulation
as a function of source–drain and side-gate voltages Vb and Vg for a GNR
with a width and length of 68 ± 2 and 187 ± 3 nm, respectively.
The distance between the GNR and gate extension was 80 ± 5 nm.
The measurement was performed at room temperature within the TEM.

In our experiments, the GNRs are
suspended between source and drain
electrodes and in proximity to the side-gate electrode (Figure 1b). The GNRs and graphene side
gates are fabricated with nanometer precision by cutting continuous
graphene sheets with a focused electron beam by operating the TEM
in scanning mode (STEM).22,23 After the in
situ device fabrication we measure the current I flowing through the GNR for a fixed source–drain voltage Vb while the gate potential Vg is varied. In this way, we modulate the GNR conductance
within the TEM column at room temperature (Figure 1c). The sign and magnitude of the measured
changes in GNR conductance are explained by considering the electric
field strength at the GNR channel, which we estimate with numerical
simulations to be a maximum of ∼107 V m–1 in our experiments. This study demonstrates in situ TEM implementation and fabrication of three-terminal devices with
nanometer features from a 2D material and, importantly, their in situ operation. Extending this work, we envision a wide
range of in situ TEM transport experiments in nanoscale
systems that exploit the TEM’s atomic precision to study and
understand correlations between transport phenomena and atomic structure.

Results
and Discussion
Observations were carried out with an electron
microscope (JEOL
2010F) operated at 200 kV. TEM-compatible chips were mounted in a
sample holder with electrical feedthroughs (Hummingbird Scientific)
for electronic-transport measurements. Chips were fabricated with
standard photolithography, electron-beam lithography, and etching
processes (a detailed description is given in the Methods section). Briefly, we used 100-nm-thick SiNx films spanning areas of ∼60 × 60 μm2 as insulating supports for metal electrodes and graphene
and as electron-transparent windows. In each chip, graphene was patterned
into a 2-μm-wide strip in contact with the three electrodes.
Freestanding-graphene areas were obtained by making gaps in the SiNx film with a focused ion beam prior to graphene
deposition (Figure 2a). Electron diffraction and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirmed
the presence of graphene between the electrodes (see Supporting Information SI-1).

graphene. The top HAADF STEM image served as reference for the cutting

TEM images showing GNR width reduction (from top to bottom). Dotted
lines indicate the first and second cutting paths used to reduce the
width of the same GNR. The images’ brightness and contrast
were modified for clarity.

We made the GNR and graphene gate electrode of each device
with
the same in situ fabrication process by appropriately
cutting the continuous freestanding graphene strip with the electron
beam. The beam was focused into a probe and scanned over the sample
in STEM mode following a preprogrammed series of parallel and perpendicular
lines designed to achieve the desired geometry: a single GNR with
an isolated graphene side gate nearby. The beam energy onset for displacement
of carbon atoms from graphene is ∼90 keV.24 Hence, set at 200 keV, the beam used in our experiments
can cut through graphene. For this energy the knock-on displacement
cross section for a carbon atom in graphene is ∼15 barn.24,25 Therefore, to displace all carbon atoms from an area of 1 nm2 requires ∼109 electrons (1 nm2/15 barn). This corresponds to an irradiation dose (charge per unit
area) of 108 C m–2. A lower dose would
cause less damage to the lattice. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)
STEM images are composed with the signal from electrons scattered
with angles > 50 mrad with each pixel’s intensity proportional
to the mass probed by the beam. This mass contrast readily distinguishes
the presence and absence of graphene in HAADF STEM images. Bearing
in mind the above considerations, the procedure to sculpt graphene
comprises the following steps:22,23 (1) acquiring a HAADF
STEM reference image with a low irradiation dose (∼103 C m–2) to minimize damage in the graphene area
to be modified, (2) designing a cutting path using the acquired reference
image, and (3) driving the beam through the designed path with a dosage
high enough to cut graphene (∼108 C m–2). The beam can be placed at any point within the reference HAADF
STEM image. Thus, any pattern can be engraved in graphene, as illustrated
in Figure 2b with the
cutting of a line. We used a 2-nm-diameter probe with a current of
3 nA (current density ∼109 A m–2). HAADF STEM reference images were acquired with irradiation dwell
times per pixel on the order of 1 μs, with 256 × 256 pixels
and a pixel size of <10 nm. Similar imaging conditions induced
only minimal changes in the conductance of GNRs supported by SiNx
films.16 To cut graphene, the dwell time
per pixel was increased 5 orders of magnitude to 0.1–0.5 s.

To maximize the capacitive coupling between GNR and gate electrode,
the separation between them was kept minimal to around 50–150
nm by sculpting a gate extension from the graphene strip (Figure 2c), connected to
a larger Au electrode. As explained below, according to numerical
calculations the electric field at the GNR channel is expected to
be ∼3 times stronger with than without the graphene gate extension
(i.e., only the Au electrode). We
also used the electron-beam-based sculpting procedure to reduce the
GNR’s width in each device by gradually reducing the width
of the original GNR (Figure 2d).

Graphene was annealed via Joule
heating before,
during, and after sculpting with currents up to 10–4 A, yielding current densities on the order of 1012 A
m–2 (see Supporting Information SI-2). With these conditions graphene can be heated to temperatures
above 1000 K.26 Annealing avoids contamination
by enhancing diffusion of mobile hydrocarbons, increases the rate
of recombination of defects (interstitials and vacancies), and induces
crystallization of amorphous carbon.18,26−28 The described annealing effects help to contain electron-irradiation-induced
damage in the GNRs.

To model the effect of the side gate on
the GNR conductance in
our in situ TEM transport measurements, we estimated
numerically the electrostatic potential V at the
channel for the electrode geometry in our experiment (Figure 3a). In this analysis, the central
point of the channel closest to the gate electrode is defined as p0, and the distance between channel and gate
is defined as dg. From each electric potential
distribution V, we derived the electric field strength E (see Supporting Information SI-3 for details). The effect of extending the gate spatially, from
the Au electrode toward the channel, on the electric field E is shown in Figure 3b, where we plot E at p0 for different dg as a function
of Vg. It is at this point in the area
covered by a GNR that the E is strongest. Hence,
with our chip configuration we expect maximum values of E ≈ 107 V m–1 at p0. To put this value in perspective, we compare it to
the E in a back-gate FET device with a 300 nm thick
SiO2 gate layer, an arrangement commonly used for GNR devices.
For a 1 V gate potential the electric field strength is about the
same, E ≈ 0.3 × 107 V m–1 at p0, in both the back-
and side-gate configurations, when dg =
100 nm in the latter case. However, the charging effect will be approximately
4 times stronger in the back-gate configuration because the permittivity
of SiO2 is 3.9 × permittivity of vacuum (the pressure
in the TEM column is 10–5 Pa). In addition, the E magnitude decays as the distance in the channel from the
side-gate electrode increases (Figure 3c).

Figure 3 Numerical calculations of electrostatic potential and
electric
field induced by side-gate electrode. (a) Electrostatic potential
for side-gate voltage Vg = 1 V and source
and drain electrodes grounded (V = 0 V). In this
example, the distance from the extended gate to the channel dg = 100 nm. The dash-dotted line indicates the
plane from which the cross section (right) was taken. The potential
at p0, the closest point from gate to
channel in this model, is not zero. (b) Electric field strength E at p0 as a function of Vg for six different distances dg. When dg = 150 nm the extension
of the gate, carved from graphene in the experiment, is zero in this
model. (c) Electric field strength E as a function
of distance from the side gate in a line passing through p0. Here, we use the same geometrical parameters as in
(a).

We present results from three
nanosculpted devices tested at room
temperature, the TEM’s column operating temperature. During
all transport measurements the electron beam was blocked to avoid
the electron-beam-induced damage of the GNRs. The Vg sweep was restricted to a ±10 V range to prevent
leakage currents through the SiNx film
and the devices’ mechanical collapse due to electrostatic forces.29 Details of the measurements and leakage current
analysis are provided in Supporting Information SI-4. Figure 4a and
b show the conductance G and ΔG = G – G0, respectively,
where G0 is G evaluated
at Vg = 0, as a function of Vg for three GNRs with widths W of 113
± 2, 68 ± 2, and 31 ± 3 nm. The GNR length L in each device is defined by the SiNx gap’s length. Since the GNR that was 68 nm wide was
obtained by cutting the GNR that was initially 113 nm wide (see Figure 2d), these two same-chip
devices had the same L (187 ± 3 nm) and dg (80 ± 5 nm). The GNR with a width of
31 nm wide was patterned in another chip with L =
182 ± 2 nm and dg = 58 ± 4 nm.
The quoted distances for W and dg correspond to values averaged along each GNR length.
For these measurements the source–drain voltage was set to Vb = 0.1 V.

31 ± 3 nm. Values of ΔG ≠ 0 indicate
that the GNR conductance was modulated by the side-gate potential.
(c) Conductance as a function of Vg in
a graphene-derived constriction. Inset: TEM image of channel composed
of two paths (indicated by arrows) separated by a hole in the structure.
The paths are 12 and <2 nm wide at their narrowest points. During
these measurements the source–drain voltage was set to Vb = 0.1 V. All lines are a noise-reduction fit
to each raw data set (black points).

In addition to demonstrating the modulation of a GNR channel’s
conductance with a side-gate electrode within a TEM column, these
results indicate that the side-gate electrode’s capacity to
modulate the conductance increases as the GNR width decreases. In
particular, changes in G were only registered as
the GNR width in each device was reduced from an initial value of W ≈ 1 μm to a few tens of nanometers. The trend
is evident when comparing the GNRs’ ΔG values (Figure 4b).
The GNR that was 113 nm wide shows ΔG ≈
0 for all Vg in contrast to the other
two narrower GNRs for which ΔG ≠ 0 in
the same Vg range. In general, as the W/L channel ratio of a FET device increases,
short-channel effects result in a weakened gate capacity to control
transport.30 This effect has been observed
in back-gated GNR devices31 but should
be more pronounced in our devices because the electric field strength
decreases along the GNR width (see Figure 3c). In addition, GNRs have energy gaps ∼1/W that lead to larger Ion/Ioff ratios for narrower GNRs.32,33 These effects coincide qualitatively with our result that the side-gate’s
capacity to modulate transport is stronger for narrower GNRs.

The GNR conductance of the analyzed GNRs (G ≈
17, 19, and 22 μS for GNR width W = 31 ±
3, 68 ± 2, and 113 ± 2 nm, respectively) is close to the
expected minimum conductance of ∼(e2/h) × (W/L) for a GNR at room temperature,32 suggesting
that the as-fabricated GNRs are not in the on-state. However, the
gate-voltage range (|Vg| ≤ 10 V)
prevented us from establishing the full on/off-state response of the
studied GNR devices. Considering the sense of the registered changes
in G as a function of Vg (ΔG/ΔVg < 0), our measurements are consistent with that of p-type GNRs
that are in an electronic state close to the minimum conductance with
a charge-neutrality point at Vg > 0.
The
shift of the charge-neutrality point is most likely caused by impurities
and substrate effects in graphene areas adjacent to the freestanding
channel. For the narrowest GNR device (W = 31 ±
3 nm) we estimated a subthreshold swing S ≈
ΔVg/Δ(log I),30 which quantifies the efficiency to
turn on and off a FET-type device, of S ≈
860 V dec–1. By comparison, a back-gated (300-nm-thick
SiO2 gate layer) GNR that is 24 nm wide (from exfoliated
graphene) was shown to have an S ≈ 80 V dec–1 at room temperature.32 Assuming similar graphene conductivity in both cases, the side-gate
device is 10 times less efficient, in agreement with a lower channel-gate
capacitive coupling in the side-gate configuration, recalling that
for this configuration we estimate a 4-fold weaker charging effect
(at p0) from the calculated electric field.
Possible improvements to boost the coupling between side-gate and
channel include reducing the distance dg, adding dielectric layers to partially fill the vacuum gap between
gate and channel, and patterning an additional side-gate electrode
opposite the first to reduce the asymmetry of the electric field at
the channel and increase its strength. In the end, changes in chip
configuration will have to be tailored according to a channel’s
material and size.

The combination of GNR width reduction and
annealing produced channels
a few nanometers wide that ultimately failed by channel rupture. The
graphene-derived structures obtained before failure resembled constrictions13−15 rather than well-defined ribbons but also displayed modulation in G as a function of Vg. An example
of a constriction and its conductance response is shown in Figure 4c. This constriction
was formed in the middle of a GNR (W = 50 ±
2 nm and L = 180 ± 3 nm) and consisted of two
separated channels with an average length of roughly 10 nm. One channel
resembles a 12-nm-wide GNR and the other, with a <
2 nm span at its narrowest point, a carbon nanotube. For this constriction G showed a peak (about Vg = −5 V) similar to those observed in devices possessing
negative differential conductance. At this point we can only speculate
the origin of this peak, but given the relative short length of the
constriction, a resonant tunneling effect cannot be discarded, and
more studies would be needed to fully understand this observation.
For example, by increasing the image resolution with an aberration-corrected
TEM, this observation could be correlated with the precise atomic
arrangement and edge structure (armchair, zigzag, roughness, etc.) of the GNR.

Conclusions
In summary, we carried
out in situ TEM transport
measurements with devices fabricated in situ that
contain a side-gate electrode that modulates the carrier density in
a freestanding channel a few nanometers wide. In particular, we outline
the STEM procedure to form gated graphene structures, and we demonstrate
the resulting side-gate-induced modulation of conductance at room
temperature in GNRs fabricated within the TEM column. This emphasizes
that our approach enables both a full characterization of the active
channel in an FET-type configuration and structural modifications
of the device via electron-beam sculpting. With state-of-the-art
instrumentation the spatial resolution of both the channel characterization
(structural and chemical) and beam-induced modifications can be pushed
to the atomic level. The combined method of beam-induced channel modifications
with in situ TEM transport measurements is especially
well-suited for other 2D materials, provided that the specific beam
energy and dose requirements have been met. With slight modifications
this method can be applied to investigate transport phenomena in nanoscale
systems, such as single-molecule transport or metal-to-insulator transitions
dependent on channel width or edge structure, where the resolution
of the channel’s atomic structure is of paramount importance.

Methods
Graphene Growth
We used graphene grown via atmospheric pressure
chemical vapor deposition on Cu foil (99.8%
purity).34 For graphene growth the Cu foil
is sonicated in acetone for 10 min and then dried with N2 after rinsing in deionized water. Then, the foil is inserted into
a sealed 1 in. quartz tube furnace. A mixture of Ar (500 sccm) and
H2 (50 sccm) is introduced into the tube for 10 min to
flush the tube. Afterwards, the furnace is set to 1057 °C, the
H2 flow is reduced to 25 sccm, and 2 sccm of a 1% CH4 in an Ar mixture is flowed into the tube. After 100 min of
growth the furnace is turned off and the tube is moved to a position
where the foil is 2 in. away from the furnace entrance. Once the oven
reaches 850 °C, the flow rates for Ar, H2, and CH4 are changed to 1000, 7, and 0 sccm, respectively. Finally,
the foil is removed when the tube reaches room temperature.

Fabrication
Details of TEM-Compatible Chips
Si/SiNx substrates
(from WRS Materials) consisting of 300-nm-thick
Si wafers covered by 100-nm-thick low stress (<100 MPa) SiNx films were patterned and etched to fabricate 5 ×
3.5 mm2 chips, with each chip containing an area ∼60
× 60 μm2 of freestanding SiNx film resembling a “window”. The SiNx window is transparent to the electron beam and supports
the device’s metal electrodes and graphene. The windows were
fabricated by, first, etching the SiNx with SF6 from squares (450 × 450 μm2) patterned with photolithography in one side of the wafer and, second,
etching the exposed Si with a KOH bath. T-shaped Au/Cr electrodes
with thicknesses of 50–100/10 nm were fabricated in the windows
with photolithography followed by metal thermal evaporation. To allow
for freestanding graphene areas, a fork-shaped gap 150–200
nm wide was made in the windows containing electrodes with a focused
ion beam with Ga source. Then, the windows were completely covered
by CVD-grown graphene. After transferring a continuous film of graphene
into the SiNx window a protective strip
2 μm wide of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) covering the graphene
was patterned at the intersection of the electrodes with electron-beam
lithography. The graphene outside the protective strip was etched
with O2 plasma and, finally, the PMMA resist was removed.
For in situ TEM transport measurements, the TEM-compatible
devices were pasted and wire-bonded to TEM chip carriers, which in
turn were mounted to a sample holder with electrical feedthroughs
(Hummingbird Scientific).
