The response of living systems to
nanoparticles is thought to depend
on the protein corona, which forms shortly after exposure to physiological
fluids and which is linked to a wide array of pathophysiologies. A
mechanistic understanding of the dynamic interaction between proteins
and nanoparticles and thus the biological fate of nanoparticles and
associated proteins is, however, often missing mainly due to the inadequacies
in current ensemble experimental approaches. Through the application
of a variety of single molecule and single particle spectroscopic
techniques in combination with ensemble level characterization tools,
we identified different interaction pathways between gold nanorods
and bovine serum albumin depending on the protein concentration. Overall,
we found that local changes in protein concentration influence everything
from cancer cell uptake to nanoparticle stability and even protein
secondary structure. We envision that our findings and methods will
lead to strategies to control the associated pathophysiology of nanoparticle
exposure in vivo.

==== Body
The interaction
of nanoparticles
with living organisms has received growing attention in the past decade1−3 due to the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic tools,4−6 and the growing concerns regarding the safety of nanomaterials in vivo.7−11 It is understood that nanoparticles adsorb proteins in biological
fluids forming a “protein corona”, which influences
the nanoparticle physicochemical properties and subsequent interactions
with the physiological environment.12−27 Both the possibility that in vivo administration
of therapeutic nanoparticles can disturb the structural integrity
of proteins and the current knowledge of the direct link between denatured
proteins and severe neurodegenerative diseases suggest that nanotherapeutic
platforms potentially pose a health risk.2,28−30 Therefore, understanding the interaction of proteins
with nanoparticles on a molecular level is paramount for the efficient
and safe application of engineered nanoparticles.

The quantification
and identification of the protein corona composition
for different types of nanoparticles with varying surface chemistries
have been undertaken.12,14,30−34Ex situ ensemble techniques such as gel electrophoresis
coupled with mass spectrometry have been widely used to characterize
the chemical identity and abundance of constituent corona proteins
after separation from the nanoparticles.12,29 Less disruptive, complementary optical spectroscopy approaches can
be used to study the protein–nanoparticle complex in
situ and were able to determine the thermodynamics of protein
binding as well as to provide insight into the interactions between
protein coated nanoparticles and cells.15,35−38 For instance, the micromolar affinity of serum albumin to colloidal
nanoparticles resulting in a protein monolayer15 at physiological concentrations and enhanced colloidal
stability in plasma39 have been revealed
by a combination of UV–vis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopic
techniques. Payne and co-workers have used super-resolution optical
imaging under in vitro conditions, and demonstrated
that what cellular receptors actually screen are the adsorbed proteins
and not the initially synthesized nanoparticles themselves.40,41 Spectroscopic methods are ideally suited to characterize changes
in protein structure when bound to a nanoparticle surface. The structural
integrity of the corona proteins, which domains of the protein bind
and which ones potentially change their structure,28,42−48 has been studied by using far- and near-UV circular dichroism (CD),28,42,43,49,50 IR,43,50 and Raman44 spectroscopy.

While the protein–nanoparticle
community has begun to transition
from the mere identification of adsorbed proteins to the understanding
of the physiological responses that can arise due to the presence
of the protein corona, it is still not fully understood how protein
adsorption affinities, relative concentrations, and surface chemistries
are ultimately linked to the corona composition and to possible structural
changes of the proteins. A mechanistic bridge between these aspects
is lacking due to the low spatiotemporal resolution and ex
situ requirements of most current techniques.18 Ensemble analytical techniques that assume quasi-equilibrium
conditions with exchange between free and bound proteins have furthermore
led to controversial results.12,19,30−33,51

Here, we have used a combined
approach of ensemble and single protein/single
nanoparticle methods to answer the following questions about the nanoparticle
protein corona: Is thermodynamic equilibrium a valid concept for the
protein corona as local changes in protein concentrations occur? How
does protein adsorption influence protein chemistry? How is nanoparticle
stability altered? Finally, how might equilibrium and nonequilibrium
protein/nanoparticle interactions influence physiological outcomes?
Mechanistic understanding of the physicochemical properties of bovine
serum albumin (BSA) adsorbed to cationic-ligand functionalized gold
nanorods (AuNRs) is studied here as the experimental system. While
an ensemble protein adsorption isotherm implicates the adsorption
of several proteins to the nanoparticle surface, single protein/single
nanoparticle interactions visualized through superlocalization imaging
reveal that in fact only one protein is irreversibly adsorbed at a
time. The seemingly conflicting findings are resolved through surface
plasmon coupled CD spectroscopy, and demonstrate that the local changes
in protein concentration affect the colloidal stability of nanoparticles,
protein secondary structure and eventually cellular uptake of nanoparticles.

Results
and Discussion
When nanoparticles are preincubated in BSA
at lower than physiological
concentrations, properties such as uptake by MCF-7 cancer cells, BSA
adsorption, and nanoparticle aggregation are strongly influenced (Figure 1). Cationic mercaptoundecyltrimethylammonium
bromide coated AuNRs (MUTAB-AuNRs) incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) are uptaken by MCF-7 cancer cells (Figure 1a,b).52 However,
with preincubation of the MUTAB-AuNRs in 1% (w/v) BSA, the uptake
is increased 3-fold (Figure 1b). This increase is not due to MUTAB-AuNRs adhered to the
outside of the cells as the cells are washed several times with PBS
following a previously published protocol.52 As the most abundant serum protein, BSA is present in higher concentrations
in FBS than 1% (w/v). Preincubation of MUTAB-AuNRs with 1% (w/v) BSA,
however, seems to influence their interaction with cancer cells and
causes increased uptake. It is thus important to understand if and
how the BSA-based protein corona is protein dependent. In
situ ensemble, single molecule, and single particle spectroscopies
are used to address these issues.

Figure 1 Preincubation of MUTAB-AuNRs with low
concentrations of BSA strongly
influences AuNR cell uptake, BSA protein adsorption, and NR aggregation.

(b) Number of MUTAB-AuNRs uptaken per MCF-7 cell for MUTAB-AuNRs preincubated

essential medium (EMEM), compared to MUTAB-AuNRs only suspended in
10% FBS and EMEM. Cells suspended in 10% FBS and EMEM without MUTAB-AuNRs
are shown as a control. (c) Increases in MUTAB-AuNR fluctuation correlation
decay time caused by BSA adsorption. Luminescence correlation decays

BSA (blue) vs in higher serum-level BSA concentrations
(orange). Autocorrelation curves with respective decay fits shown
as solid lines. Under low BSA concentration, the fit did not follow
a predictable model; dashed line is instead shown as a guide for the
eye. (d) UV/vis spectra under similar conditions as (c) suggest MUTAB-NR
aggregation occurs when incubated at low concentrations of BSA.

Luminescence correlation spectroscopy
provides strong support that
the BSA protein corona that forms on MUTAB-AuNRs is concentration
dependent (Figure 1c). At high protein concentrations (20 μM), the increase in
measured hydrodynamic radius matches the dimensions of native BSA53 and hence implies the formation of a protein
monolayer, consistent with earlier reports of BSA monolayer formation
on nanoparticles (Table S1).15,54,55 In contrast, at lower BSA concentrations
(2 nM), the luminescence correlation decay shifts to longer average
decay times, indicating that surprisingly the nanoparticle–protein
complex has become even larger than what is observed under the high
BSA concentration conditions. Most importantly, the data could not
be fit to an equilibrium adsorption model, suggesting nonequilibrium
behavior, consistent with nanoparticle aggregation as verified further
below.

Further support for the strong deviation between low
and high BSA
concentrations is found in the UV–vis spectra (Figure 1d). At high BSA concentrations,
the extinction spectrum of the MUTAB-AuNRs is slightly red-shifted,
due to a change in dielectric environment and consistent with equilibrium
formation of a stable BSA monolayer. However, at low BSA concentrations,
the decreased intensity and resonance shift of the plasmon resonance
indicate that the MUTAB-AuNRs aggregate in the presence of low BSA
concentrations.

The combination of our results on cancer cell
uptake, protein adsorption,
and nanoparticle colloidal stability strongly suggest that local protein
concentrations must be considered when assessing corona chemistry
and its influence on nanoparticles’ ultimate physiological
fate, as suggested previously.11,20 Of particular interest
in Figure 1 is the
case of low protein concentrations. Low protein-to-nanoparticle ratios
can, for example, occur under controlled preincubation conditions
after injection into a living organism and upon accumulation in cellular
compartments. Thus, we examine more closely the structure of BSA and
nanoparticles when they interact at low concentrations and suggest
how these processes lead to the ultimate fate of the protein–nanoparticle
colloid.

BSA adsorbs at low concentrations to cationic ligand-coated
gold
nanomaterials of varying geometries (Figure 2). A 2 nM concentration of Alexa647-labeled
BSA (3 dyes per protein) is flowed over individual nanomaterials of
varying surface chemistries (cationic MUTAB, cationic amine poly(ethylene
glycol) [NH2–PEG], and anionic citrate) and different
geometries (nanospheres [∼50 nm diameter], nanowires [width,
∼70 nm; length, 1–10 μm], and nanorods [width,
20 nm; length, 58 nm]). BSA binding to these different nanostructures
is visualized via an increase in fluorescence intensity
due to adsorption of the fluorescently labeled protein. Because of
total internal refection excitation, only individual molecules at
the surface are registered, while freely diffusing proteins contribute
to a slightly larger average background signal.56 We find that BSA binds to the cationic-ligand functionalized
nanomaterials at this low concentration. On the other hand, negligible
binding of BSA to the citrate capped nanospheres is observed under
the same conditions. Much higher micromolar concentrations are needed
for this ligand.35 To understand the mechanistic
details of protein adsorption at low concentrations to cationic nanomaterials,
we will concentrate on the interactions between MUTAB-AuNRS and BSA
as example nanoparticle supports and serum proteins, respectively.

Figure 2 Single
molecule imaging of BSA interactions with nanomaterials
of varying geometries (sphere, wire, rod) and surface chemistries
(cationic MUTAB, cationic NH2-PEG-SH, anionic citrate).
Images show nanomaterial highlighted with dashed red outline (left)
before and (right) after 2 nM Alexa-BSA is introduced. Images are
binned, ranging from 10 to 100 frames. These results show that BSA
binding occurs independent of the nanoparticle geometry. Furthermore,
a different surface chemistry also facilitates binding as long as
the surface charge remains positive. No significant adsorption is
seen for negative charged citrate capped nanoparticles at this BSA
concentration.

Single molecule analysis
of the fluorescence imaging data reveals
that only one BSA protein binds irreversibly to each MUTAB-AuNR (Figure 3). BSA adsorption
onto single MUTAB-AuNRs is identified by colocalization57 of dye fluorescence and intrinsic AuNR luminescence
(Figure 3a, Figures S1–S3 and Video S1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image analysis
confirms that 99% of the analyzed BSA adsorption events occur at single
MUTAB-AuNRs (Figure S4) with little nonspecific
BSA interaction with the substrate because of surface passivation
(Figure S5).

Figure 3 Single BSA proteins adsorb
to single MUTAB-AuNRs. (a) Colocalization
of single MUTAB-AuNRs, confirmed by SEM (inset; scale bar, 50 nm),
with fluorescently labeled BSA. Fluorescence images are 74 frames
binned with the same intensity; scale bar 500 nm. AuNRs are visible
through their weak intrinsic photoluminescence using long exposure
times before introducing BSA. (b) Intensity transient (black) of BSA
adsorbed to a MUTAB-AuNR with state and step identification (teal
dashed line) of photobleaching steps. (c) Distribution of the number
of photobleaching steps for 86 transients. (d) Simultaneous photobleaching
steps are unlikely. For a labeling density of 3 fluorophores per BSA
molecule, the average photobleaching step size as a percent of the
maximum intensity should be ∼33%, which is indeed confirmed
by the observed average step size of 30 ± 10%. A value of >66%
indicates simultaneous photobleaching events. Out of the 213 photobleaching
steps analyzed, <4% of steps had values greater than 60%.

Although BSA in its native form
is smaller than a AuNR, we find
no evidence for multiple BSA adsorption by analyzing fluorescence
time transients (Figure 3b,c). Protein adsorption is observed as an increase in fluorescence
intensity, followed by a stepwise decrease as each of the dye molecules
on the protein photobleaches (Figure 3b). Photobleaching step and intensity distribution
analyses are commonly used in single molecule experiments to detect
single vs oligomer states of proteins,58,59 including proteins with multiple dyes.60,61 The number of photobleaching steps identified by an established
step-finding algorithm46 is thus a direct
measure of the BSA molecules per AuNR (Figure 3b, line). Analysis for 86 AuNRs yields an
average of 3.2 ± 1.2 photobleaching steps (Figure 3c), matching the single protein labeling
density indicated by the supplier (Molecular Probes, A34785). Further
controls involve eliminating the presence of simultaneous photobleaching
of multiple dyes (Figure 3d), reversible protein desorption/readsorption (Figure S6), or dye fluorescence quenching close
to the AuNRs (Video S2). In particular, Figure 3d confirms that despite
the labeling with 3 dyes a BSA molecule does not behave as a multichromophoric
system capable of simultaneous off/on blinking of all dyes due to
energy transfer.

The adsorption of single BSA proteins to single
MUTAB-AuNRs is
irreversible on a time scale of 8 h as demonstrated by a constant
percentage of AuNR-BSA complexes while continuously rinsing with buffer
solution without proteins (Figure 4). It is not clear, however, if this observation of
only one protein adsorbing to each immobilized MUTAB-AuNR extends
to the solution case. The exposed AuNR surface area is about twice
as large in solution, but the protein-to-nanoparticle ratio is only
∼26, as ∼75 pM nanorods are exposed to 2 nM BSA. It
is not trivial to quantify this ratio for MUTAB-AuNRs immobilized
on a substrate, but we estimate this number to be orders of magnitude
larger given that 2 nM BSA (∼108 BSA proteins/μL)
is flowed over single nanorods spaced out at least 1 μm from
each other at a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 15 min. Regardless
of the experimental geometry (i.e., free MUTAB-AuNRs
in solution vs immobilized on a surface), there is
space for many dozens of proteins to bind to each AuNR (width = 20
nm, length = 58 nm; resulting surface area of ∼3000 nm2), assuming a native BSA conformation that can be approximated
by an equilateral triangular prism with 2 triangular facets of ∼28
nm2 and 3 smaller rectangular sides of ∼12 nm2.53 The only hypothesis that explains
how the strong, irreversible adsorption of single (or few) BSA molecules
can lead to the results shown in Figure 1 is if BSA is undergoing structural changes
upon adsorption.

Figure 4 Irreversible adsorption of BSA to MUTAB-AuNRs. (a) Representative
images of BSA/MUTAB-AuNRs identified based on the stronger BSA signal
(circles) before (No BSA), after (t = 0 min) adding
a 2 nM BSA solution, and after 500 min of rinsing with buffer. False
identification (No BSA) is likely due to <1% of AuNR aggregates
with higher photoluminescence intensities. Scale bar, 5 μm.
(b) Percent of MUTAB-AuNRs with adsorbed BSA molecules identified
before and after rinsing. Values calculated from five different, uncorrelated
400 μm2 areas for each data point to avoid photobleaching.

Using CD spectroscopy and subdiffraction
localization microscopy,
we find that BSA undergoes an unprecedented large loss in α-helical
structure when adsorbed to MUTAB-AuNRs (Figure 5). BSA is primarily α-helical in secondary
structure. Therefore, increases in the negative peaks at 209 and 222
nm and decreases in the positive peak at 192 nm in the UV CD spectrum
indicate a loss of BSA α-helical structure in the presence of
MUTAB-AuNRs (Figure 5a). Similar behavior is observed for MUTAB-coated Au nanospheres
(Figures S7 and S8), in contrast to citrate-capped
Au nanospheres or in the presence of only MUTAB ligand (Figures S9, S10a, S11). From the UV CD signal,
we calculate the loss of protein order using the DichroWeb K2d neural
network secondary structure analysis62,63 to be 20 ±
9%, similar to results obtained on cationic-functionalized silica
particles.49 This analysis, however, provides
only a low estimate because of unbound native BSA in solution. After
centrifugation and removal of the supernatant solution, the CD signal
is much weaker, while the supernatant solution shows a comparable
CD signal to the uncentrifuged sample (Figure 5a, Figure S10b).

alone (red). Magnified view of UV region provided in Figure S12c. (c) Super-resolution map of identified individual
BSA molecules, represented by different colored outlines, based on
cross-correlation analysis. The identified BSA locations are overlaid
on the average fluorescence image. Representative distances between
neighboring BSA molecules are shown. See Figures S13 and S14 for further details regarding data analysis.

For another estimation of the
loss of α-helical structure
and to ensure that BSA remains adsorbed to the MUTAB-AuNRs after centrifugation,
we turn to surface plasmon coupled CD spectroscopy in the visible
spectral region (Figure 5b). A strong CD signal in the visible region at the plasmon resonance
is observed due to the chiral BSA protein adsorbed onto the nonchiral
MUTAB-AuNRs. Plasmonic nanomaterials can act as strong visible light
antennas for the chirality of surface adsorbed molecules, manifested
by a chiral response of the plasmon resonance itself.64−67 After centrifugation, the surface plasmon coupled CD signal is still
observed, confirming the presence of BSA (Figure 5b). The decrease in CD intensity quantitatively
matches the decrease in the optical density and is therefore due to
the loss of AuNRs during centrifugation (Figure S10c). This data allows us to calculate an upper limit of ∼70%
change in α-helical structure of BSA adsorbed to MUTAB-AuNRs
(Figures S8 and S10):  where these values are extracted from the
CD spectra measured in mDeg in the UV (209 nm) and visible regions
(645 nm) shown in Figure 5a,b. The correction factor (CD645,BSA+MUTAB-AuNRs/CD645,centrif.BSA+MUTAB-AUNRs) is used to take
into the account the loss of BSA bound MUTAB-AuNRs in the centrifugation
step, making use of the plasmon-coupled CD signal.

Subdiffraction
localization mapping of protein binding to nanowires
supports the large extent of unfolding (Figure 5c). Larger Au nanowires functionalized with
MUTAB (width, ∼70 nm; length, 1–10 μm) are exposed
to 1 nM BSA and multiple protein binding events are imaged. Most of
the available nanowire surface area is covered by BSA (Figure 2). Because of this high coverage,
the smallest distance between nearest-neighbor proteins is determined
by cross-correlating the intensity transients of neighboring pixels
(Figures S13 and S14). Such analysis, compared
to superlocalization mapping of individual fluorophores,56,68 is less affected by possible distortions in the point spread functions
of the protein dye labels due to their positions and orientations69 on a plasmonic substrate. Figure 5c shows the most likely locations of seven
individual BSA proteins adsorbed onto a large MUTAB-Au nanowire identified
with high confidence. The average distance between neighboring unfolded
BSA proteins is larger than 200 nm and explains why only a single
BSA molecule can bind to the available surface area of the smaller
MUTAB-AuNRs. On the basis of the change in adsorbed protein structure,
it is possible to explain the nanoparticle aggregation at low BSA
concentrations (Figure 1d).

An unfolded BSA corona on MUTAB-AuNRs causes AuNR aggregation
(Figure 6). MUTAB-AuNRs
preincubated
with BSA form aggregates with immobilized MUTAB-AuNRs that were similarly
preincubated with BSA. Figure 6a shows a cartoon of the experiment conditions, in which large
aggregates are formed on the substrate as observed by SEM (Figure 6b, insets). Particle
size analysis quantifies a large increase in both the number of structures
(single AuNRs and aggregates) and distribution of surface areas for
the samples with substrate and solution BSA/MUTAB-AuNR in comparison
to samples consisting of only one of the components (Figure S15 and Table S2).

Figure 6 Nanoparticle aggregation is induced by
interactions between unfolded
proteins. (a) Cartoon showing a MUTAB-AuNR immobilized on a substrate
(i) and aggregation of such supported AuNR with BSA coated AuNRs in
solution when 2 nM BSA/MUTAB-AuNRs is introduced into the flow cell
(ii). Samples were imaged by SEM (insets, scale bar, 500 nm). (b)
The log–log scale distribution quantifies the AuNR particle
surface areas observed within 235 μm2 of the SEM
images. Both single AuNRs and isolated aggregates were counted as
individual particles. Case (ii) shows a large increase in the number
of particles n and the distribution of surface areas A (blue, n = 333; A =
(17 000 ± 50000) nm2), while for case (i),
exclusively single particles are found (purple, n = 152; A = (1300 ± 200) nm2). Further
controls and analysis are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S15, Table S1). (c) Proposed model in which
single protein adsorption and unfolding induce aggregation.

Consistent with irreversible BSA
binding, we find no evidence for
protein aggregates in solution (Figure S11). Further, anionic citrate-capped Au nanospheres, which adsorb BSA
but do not induce unfolding, do not aggregate (Figure S9). Most interestingly, fibrinogen and globulin cause
aggregation of MUTAB-AuNRs not only at low protein concentration,
but also at physiological conditions, potentially making the behavior
of BSA unique among the most abundant serum proteins (Figure S16). We therefore hypothesize that protein
unfolding on a highly charged nanoparticle surface is in general a
favorable process, but at the high physiological concentrations of
BSA, its designed biological function as a solubilizing and transporting
agent dominates due to complete monolayer coverage. This aspect will
be subject of future work. It should be mentioned that, while this
work was under review, a similar counterintuitive relationship between
protein concentration and nanoparticle aggregation was published by
Cedervall and co-workers.70 Despite using
negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles suspended in cow serum,
they found that IgG can induce nanoparticle aggregation at low protein
concentrations, while at high concentrations, a protein monolayer
prevents the formation of large nanoparticle aggregates.

Conclusions
On the basis of our experimental results obtained from a variety
of single molecule/particle and ensemble techniques, we propose a
nonequilibrium mechanism in which irreversible protein adsorption
occurs at low protein-to-nanoparticle ratios and is followed by BSA
unfolding (Figure 6c). In turn, unfolded BSA–BSA interactions drive the nanoparticle
aggregation process. Although protein-induced nanoparticle aggregation28,43 has been reported in the literature, we believe we have provided
a mechanistic explanation of how this process can happen under specific
conditions. Furthermore, we have directly addressed the questions
posed above. First, although we often model protein adsorption as
a dynamic equilibrium, it is clear that under certain circumstances,
the interaction between serum proteins and nanoparticles can undergo
strong nonequilibrium processes such as unfolding and aggregation.
Our results more broadly imply that modeling of protein adsorption
on nanoparticles using commonly employed equilibrium binding constants
may describe at best a pseudoequilibrium occurring at large protein
to nanoparticle ratios. Next, the extreme changes detected in MUTAB-AuNR
size in the presence of low concentrations of BSA are consistent with
unfolding of single (or few) proteins on single AuNRs followed by
aggregation driven by unfolded BSA–BSA interactions. As for
the last and most difficult question, we present strong support of
a hypothesis in which the interaction of MUTAB-AuNRs or other therapeutic
nanoparticles with even small amounts of plasma proteins, along with
their subsequent change in secondary structure, could strongly influence
their ultimate fate, be that for good or bad. Much further work is
required to test this hypothesis. Regardless, these results show how
the protein-to-nanoparticle ratio influences the physical chemistry
of the protein corona, and that achieving a single protein level of
mechanistic insight will deepen our understanding of the connections
between protein corona composition, structure and in vivo physiological pathways.

Materials and Methods
Gold Nanoparticles
Commercially available AuNRs (A12-25-750,
Nanopartz, Loveland, CO, USA) suspended in water and coated with cetyltrimethylammounium
bromide (CTAB) were functionalized with MUTAB, a cationic ligand that
covalently attaches to the gold surface via a sulfur
bond. Excess CTAB was removed by centrifugation of the stock solution
for 10 min at 7500 rpm. The AuNRs were then resuspended in 1 mg/mL
MUTAB in Millipore H2O (>1 MΩ) and placed overnight
in a water bath at 35 °C. Excess MUTAB was removed by centrifugation
at 7500 rpm for 10 min and replaced with Millipore H2O
for storage. We estimate that the final concentration of free MUTAB
in solution after this centrifugation step was less than 0.01 mg/mL.
The MUTAB-AuNR solutions were positively charged (ζ = 35 ±
5 mV) at pH 7.2 according to zeta-potential measurements (Malvern
Zen 3600). Further analyses of the MUTAB-AuNRs in the buffer conditions
of the experiments (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl in Molecular Biology Grade
H2O) by UV/vis spectroscopy (Figures S17 and S18) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Figure S19) are included in the Supporting Information.

Commercially available
citrate-coated gold nanospheres (AuNPs) with a nominal diameter of
50 nm were purchased from BBI solutions (Cardiff, U.K.). Sizing performed
by the manufacturer using TEM showed that their actual size is 48
± 4 nm (Batch # 16659, ∼75 pM concentration based on the
mass of gold per milliliter used for the synthesis). For the control
experiments shown in Figures S7–S9, citrate-AuNPs were functionalized with MUTAB using the same procedure
as described above for the AuNRs. The zeta-potential of the AuNPs
went from negatively charged (ζ = −35 ± 5 mV) in
the presence of citrate, to positively charged once functionalized
with MUTAB (ζ = 40 ± 5 mV), confirming the ligand exchange
reaction occurred.

Gold nanowires (Au nanowires, diameter ∼70
nm, length 1–10
μm) were synthesized using a modified three-step seeding synthesis
originally developed for AuNRs.71 Seed
particles were prepared by a rapid reduction of HAuCl4 (gold
precursor) using NaBH4 (reducing agent). These particles
were then grown in a solution containing HAuCl4, ascorbic
acid, and CTAB. The presence of ascorbic acid reduces the gold salt
from its Au(III) to a stable Au(I) state. Further addition of seeds
to this solution induces an autocatalytic reaction of Au(I) that enlarges
the seed particles. While this method would typically yield nanowires
with an aspect ratio smaller than 10, aspect ratios larger than 100
can be achieved when the reaction takes place in an acidic environment
(pH ∼ 2) and less seeds are added to the growth solution. CTAB
on the as-synthesized Au nanowires was replaced with MUTAB. The CTAB-Au
nanowires sedimented at the bottom of the vial after 1–2 h
at room temperature without mixing or shaking. Carefully, CTAB was
removed out of solution without removing the nanowires. An equal volume
of MUTAB (1 mg/mL in Millipore H2O) was added to fill the
volume left by removed CTAB. The solution was mixed using a micropipette
and placed overnight in a water bath at 35 °C. The MUTAB-Au nanowires
were then resuspended in solution by gently shaking the vial, and
then left untouched for 1–2 h at room temperature to allow
sedimentation. Finally, excess MUTAB was removed out of solution (carefully
without removing the nanowires), and an equal volume of Millipore
H2O was added to fill the volume left by excess MUTAB.

Cell Culture
BSA (7.5% in DBPS), penicillin–streptomycin
(10 000 U–10 mg/mL), HCl (Trace Metals Grade) and HNO3 (Trace Metals Grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MCF-7
cells were acquired from ATCC (HTB-22). EMEM (with EBSS and l-Glutamine) was purchased from Lonza. FBS (heat-inactivated) was
purchased from Seradigm. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assay
kit was purchased from Thermo Scientific. All chemicals were used
without further purification.

Microscope Glass Coverslips
Glass coverslips (22 ×
22 mm2, VWR) were cleaned by sonication for 10 min in acetone,
10 min in water/detergent mixture, and 10 min in deionized water.
The coverslips were then immersed in a bath of base (6:1:1 water,
30% H2O2, NH4OH) for 90 s at 80 °C
followed by rinsing with copious amounts of deionized water. The glass
was then cleaned for 2 min in O2 plasma (Harrick Plasma).
Cleaned coverslips were placed under vacuum for long-term storage.
Details of the passivation of the surface for correlation spectroscopy
experiments and single protein binding experiments can be found in
the caption of Figure S5.

Luminescence
Correlation Spectroscopy
Luminescence
of MUTAB-AuNRs was recorded with a home-built confocal microscope
described elsewhere.72 The instrument is
based on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Observer.D1, Zeiss)
equipped with a 638 nm diode laser (CUBE, Coherent). The laser light
was collimated and delivered to the back aperture of an oil immersion
objective (Apochromat 64×, NA = 1.4, Zeiss). The objective focused
the light onto a small liquid cell placed on top of a glass coverslip
containing 45 μL of sample solution. The emitted light was collected
by the same objective and passed through a dichroic mirror (ZT 532/638
rpc, Chroma Technology), a long pass filter (XLP-647, CVI Melles-Griot),
and a 50 μm diameter pinhole (Thorlabs) placed at the focal
plane of the microscope. The luminescence signal was detected by a
single element diode detector (PDM 50ct, Micro-Photon-Devices) and
processed by a home-built photon counting module (LabView). All measurements
were recorded at a controlled laboratory temperature of 20 ±
1 °C, and using an excitation power of 1.5 × 103 mW/cm2 at the sample. This excitation power ensured minimal
heating and negligible autofluorescence background of unlabeled BSA
(Figure S20). For protein concentration
dependent measurements as summarized in Table S1, ∼75 pM MUTAB-AuNR solutions with varying concentrations
of BSA (Catalog #A7906, Sigma-Aldrich; BSA concentrations, 0.1, 0.5,
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 nM; BSA/AuNR ratios, 1.33, 6.66, 13.33, 20,
26.66, 40, 53.33, 66.66, 133.33) were prepared by mixing equal volumes
of both solutions in buffer. The dimensions of the observation volume
were determined using a calibration sample with a known diffusion
coefficient at 20 °C (Figure S21).

Data Acquisition and Analysis for Correlation Spectroscopy Experiments
The luminescence intensity was recorded in data sets of 40 s at
a temporal resolution of 10 μs. Each data set was autocorrelated
using an automated routine in Matlab. At least seven data sets were
averaged per measurement and the experiment was repeated independently
three times at each protein concentration. The autocorrelation functions G(τ) were analyzed in Matlab using a one species,
three-dimensional diffusion model with an additional exponential term
that accounts for nanorod rotation:73  where ⟨N⟩
denotes the average number of particles in the three-dimensional Gaussian-shaped
observation volume, with radial and axial dimensions r0 and z0, respectively. The
translational diffusion time τD is related to the
translational diffusion coefficient of the particles, Dtr = r02/(4τD). An additional exponential term of amplitude A and rotational diffusion time τR was used to account
for nanorod rotational diffusion. The translational diffusion coefficient
was used to estimate the equivalent hydrodynamic radius of the nanoparticles
using the Stokes–Einstein relationship Rh = kT/6πηDtr. Changes in viscosity due to the presence of BSA were calculated
using the intrinsic viscosity of this protein (4.2 cm3/g)
assuming a linear relationship in the range of concentrations used.
Results of correlation spectroscopy experiments before and after BSA
binding at different concentrations are shown in Table S1.

Superlocalization Single Molecule Microscopy
Samples
containing single immobilized MUTAB-AuNRs (Figures 2 and 3) and MUTAB-AuNPs
(Figure 2) were prepared
by dropcasting ∼40 μL of ∼12.5 pM of nanoparticle
solutions (1:6 dilution of the concentration used for luminescence
correlation spectroscopy experiments) on microscope coverslips passivated
with unlabeled BSA (see caption of Figure S5 for details on the passivation procedure). The droplet was then
dried for 10 min at room temperature, and the coverslips were rinsed
with 1 mL of Millipore H2O and gently dried with nitrogen
gas. A home-built total internal reflection wide field microscope
with 637 nm excitation (Coherent OBIS-FP 637 LX) as described elsewhere74 was used with a custom flow chamber (1 mm height,
elliptical opening of 12 × 5 mm; 43018C, Grace BioLabs) placed
over the sample containing immobilized MUTAB-nanoparticles. A solution
of 2 nM Alexa647-labeled BSA (A34785, Molecular Probes, 3 dyes/protein)
was flowed over the sample at 5 μL/min using a Genie Plus flow
system (Kent Scientific). This flow rate does not impart strong forces
on protein-binding site interactions and results in effectively negligible
net directed diffusion due to flow.75 The
sample was allowed to equilibrate for 15 min with protein flow before
measuring, ensuring that an excess of proteins is exposed to each
nanoparticle (2 nmol BSA/L × 5 μL/min × 15 min × NA = 9 × 1010 BSA molecules compared
to ∼10 particles/5 μm2 in Figure S3 × 60 mm2 area of sample = 12 ×
105 particles/sample). Data was collected at an incident
excitation intensity of 5 mW/cm2, an integration time of
100 ms, frame rate of 7.5 Hz, and electron multiplying gain of 300.
Analysis was possible at the superlocalization level, as the fluorescent
BSA can be selectively observed only when adsorbed to the interface,
and was unobservable by motion blur when freely diffusing (D ∼ 60 μm2/s). Increases in signal-to-noise
ratio of each frame, identification of adsorbed BSA, and superlocalization
analysis of the location by radial symmetry fitting was performed
using MATLAB 2011b as described previously.57,68 Samples containing single immobilized MUTAB-Au nanowires (Figures 2, 5c, and S14) were prepared using
the same drying procedure, but because the concentration was unknown,
the solution was repeatedly diluted until single isolated nanowires
were observed in the optical microscope.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Spectroscopy
Ensemble CD measurements
were taken on a J-815 circular dichroism spectrometer (JASCO) with
a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette at 20 ± 0.1 °C using a
Peltier temperature controller. Equal volumes of ∼1 nM nanoparticle
solutions (MUTAB-AuNRs or AuNPs) and 0.1 mg/mL BSA solutions were
mixed ∼30 min before each measurement. Wavelength ranges of
190–260 and 500–750 nm were collected every 1 nm under
standard sensitivity, bandwidth of 1.00 nm, and rate of 50 nm/min.
Four scans were collected for each trial and averaged. The spectra
were baseline-corrected and presented as mean residue ellipticity.
The solvent for CD measurements was 1 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)
due to its low absorbance in the far UV. This solvent did not affect
the stability of MUTAB-AuNRs, MUTAB-AuNPs or BSA.

SEM Imaging
SEM images were taken using a FEI Quanta
400 ESEM FEG, operated at 10 kV under low vacuum conditions. Analysis
of aggregate size was performed in ImageJ.

MUTAB-AuNR Uptake by MCF-7
Cells
Preincubation of MUTAB-AuNRs under Different Media Conditions
before Incubation with MCF-7 Cells
For the experiments shown
in Figure 1a,b, MUTAB-AuNRs
were incubated in two different media conditions: (1) 1 mL of MUTAB-AuNRs
was mixed with 133 μL of 7.5% (w/v) BSA (final concentration
of BSA ∼1% w/v) and incubated overnight. This formed a BSA–corona
onto the MUTAB-AuNRs before exposure to serum. Next, the BSA-MUTAB-AuNRs
were diluted (1:10) in EMEM with 10% FBS (with 1% PCN) and incubated
overnight. (2) Then, 1 mL of MUTAB-AuNRs was directly diluted (1:10)
in EMEM with 10% FBS (with 1% PCN) and incubated overnight. Both MUTAB-AuNR
solutions were found to be stable in EMEM over the time scale of the
experiments, as observed via UV/vis spectroscopy.

Nanoparticle Incubation with MCF-7 Cells
MCF-7 cells
were seeded into two 6-well plates with each well containing 2 mL
of 100 000 cells/ml solution and cultured for 3 days in EMEM
with 10% FBS and 1% PCN (same as incubation conditions for MUTAB-AuNRs).
On the third day, the media was removed and each well was carefully
washed three times with PBS to remove adhered proteins. Two wells
were filled with 2 mL media containing either 1% BSA, 10% FBS in EMEM
with 1% PCN, or 10% FBS in EMEM with 1% PCN. The remainder of the
wells contained 2 mL of the corresponding BSA-MUTAB-AuNR solutions,
each in triplicate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 4.5%
CO2 for 6 h. After incubation for 6 h, 50 μL of media
from each well was removed in triplicate using a pipet and kept for
the LDH assay. The wells were washed with PBS three times to remove
adhered proteins and AuNRs. The cells were then detached via incubation in 0.05% trypsin with EDTA and counted using a standard
hemacytometer (Figure S22). After counting,
the cells were transferred to a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 and
placed in a −20 °C freezer overnight.

LDH Cytotoxicity
Assay of MCF-7 Cells Incubated with BSA-MUTAB-AuNRs
A LDH
assay was performed by adding 50 μL of formazan dye
(Thermo Scientific) to each well containing media from the nanoparticle–cell
incubation experiments (Figure S23). The
plates were placed in an incubator at 37 °C with 4.5% CO2 for 30 min and read on a BioTek Uniread 800 plate reader.
The purpose of this assay was to measure the cytotoxicity of the MUTAB-AuNRs
under the different incubation conditions with BSA and FBS, compared
to MCF-7 cells alone.

ICP-MS Measurement of BSA-MUTAB-AuNRs Uptaken
by MCF-7 Cells
The lysed cells were thawed and centrifuged
at 8000g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed
and the pellets were digested
using aqua regia (3:1 solution of HNO3 and HCl). Following digestion, the pellets were diluted to 10 mL
using 5% HCl in milli-Q water. The samples were measured for Au concentration
using a PerkinElmer Nexion 300 ICP-MS. The concentration of Au was
determined for each cell using the cell count collected after detaching
the cells (Figure S24).

Calculation
of the Number of AuNRs Uptaken by Each Cell
The average number
of AuNRs uptaken per cell was calculated by first
determining the number of AuNRs in the different solutions with cells
from the concentration of Au determined via ICP-MS.
The number of AuNRs was then divided by the average number of cells.
The addition of BSA to the MUTAB-AuNRs increases the uptake by MCF-7
cells by 320% compared to the conventional incubation conditions in
EMEM with 10% FBS.
