We
measure the coherent nonlinear response of excitons in a single
layer of molybdenum disulfide embedded in hexagonal boron nitride,
forming a h-BN/MoS2/h-BN heterostructure. Using four-wave mixing microscopy and imaging,
we correlate the exciton inhomogeneous broadening with the homogeneous
one and population lifetime. We find that the exciton dynamics is
governed by microscopic disorder on top of the ideal crystal properties.
Analyzing the exciton ultrafast density dynamics using amplitude and
phase of the response, we investigate the relaxation pathways of the
resonantly driven exciton population. The surface protection via encapsulation provides stable monolayer samples with
low disorder, avoiding surface contaminations and the resulting exciton
broadening and modifications of the dynamics. We identify areas localized
to a few microns where the optical response is totally dominated by
homogeneous broadening. Across the sample of tens of micrometers,
weak inhomogeneous broadening and strain effects are observed, attributed
to the remaining interaction with the h-BN and imperfections
in the encapsulation process.

Transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) are lamellar compounds held together by van der Waals interlayer
interactions. For this reason, they can be exfoliated down to a single
layer (SL), similar to graphene obtained from graphite. Even though
the interlayer interactions are weak, they have an important effect
on the band structure of TMDs, moving them toward an indirect band
gap. When thinning bulk crystals down to SLs, many TMDs can be converted
to a direct band gap semiconductor, as first shown for MoS2. The discovery of efficient emission and absorption of light in
SL TMDs, facilitated by creation of excitons (EXs) of high binding
energy and their fast radiative recombination,1,2 made
two-dimensional TMDs candidates for next generation optoelectronics.
Additionally, the symmetry and chemical composition of the atomic
lattice of TMDs enable, besides their flexibility and partial transparency,
a wealth of innovative application concepts.3−7

Among semiconducting TMDs, MoS2 has
been the most studied
because of its expected superior stability in atmospheric conditions.
Several recent observations nevertheless challenge this expectation.
The measured EX line width has been on the order of several tens of
millielectronvolts, even at low temperatures.4,6−12 These high values indicate an inhomogeneous broadening (σ)
of the EX transition more than an order of magnitude above the homogenenous
broadening (γ) expected in the millielectronvolt (meV) range.13 The dominating inhomogeneities (σ ≫
γ) in SL MoS2 conceal the intrinsic properties of
the EXs resulting from the underlying band structure, which is still
under debate.14−16 Presumed origins of σ observed in the experiments
down to low temperature are adsorbed impurities and crystal defects
such as vacancies, strongly affecting the quantum yield.17,18 Another source of inhomogeneous broadening is the substrate onto
which the two-dimensional material is typically deposited. The most
common substrate used to fabricate optoelectronic devices, a thin
thermal oxide (silica) layer on silicon wafers, is known to be corrugated
and to contain charged impurities, generating a disordered potential
landscape for EXs in the supported TMD layer.

Recently, deterministic
transfer methods,19 developed to stack
two-dimensional materials in the form of so-called
van der Waals heterostructures,20 have
been applied to prepare MoS2 SLs sandwiched between two
thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layers.13,21,22 In these structures, the distance
between MoS2 and the charged impurities in SiO2 and possible adhered impurities on the top surface is set by the
respective h-BN thicknesses and is typically several
tens of nanometers (nm). Moreover, the van der Waals interaction is
thought to promote a close, conformal and very flat contact at the
MoS2/h-BN interface (with interfacial
distances typically of a few angstroms)23 by expelling adsorbed molecules sideways, much like a flat iron
would eliminate the pleats of a clothing. In such samples, photoluminescence
(PL) revealed sharp excitonic features of a few meV width, approaching
the expected homogeneous limit.13 The narrow
emission allowed to deepen the understanding of the excitonic complexes
involving different valleys13 and to observe
the EX’s excited states22 in MoS2 SLs. The encapsulation strategy has also been employed to
reduce σ in other TMDs.21,21,24−26

The question arises if σ could be suppressed
with this method
sufficiently to provide a dominating radiative broadening and a resulting
long-range exciton-polariton formation. Toward this, can one show
correlations between γ, σ, and population lifetime T1? Such fundamental issues are relevant for
spectroscopists and material scientists exploring optical properties
of TMD SLs and, in a broader context, for condensed matter physicists
investigating two-dimensional systems. We note that the EX spectral
line-shape measured in linear transmission or reflection13,21,22 is a convolution of γ and
σ. Separating them (for example, by applying line-shape fits
such as a Voigt profile) requires prior knowledge of homogeneous and
inhomogeneous line-shapes. For example, in the limit σ ≫
γ, the line-shape is Gaussian, such that γ cannot be reliably
estimated. Interestingly, the EX emission measured in non-resonantly
excited PL can show narrower line widths than those retrieved via resonant absorption. This can be understood as due to
the carrier and EX relaxation selecting local potential minima at
low temperatures prior to EX recombination.

To separate homogeneous
from inhomogeneous broadening in the EX
line-shape, nonlinear spectroscopy, specifically four-wave mixing
(FWM), is particularly suited. FWM driven on an inhomogeneously broadened
optical transition (for example, created by a spatially varying EX
transition in TMDs) forms a photon echo.27−30 Its temporal width is determined
by σ, assuming that the excitation pulses are sufficiently short
with respect to ℏ/σ. Conversely, its
amplitude decay with delay time between the first two exciting pulses, i.e., τ12, is only due to the microscopic
EX dephasing. In the case of a simple exponential decay, it determines
the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the homogeneous line width
γ = 2ℏ/T2, where T2 denotes the EX dephasing time.
Only in the case of vanishing σ can the latter be read from
the FWM transient, taking the form of a free induction decay, overcoming
the necessity to scan τ12. This, however, is only
known a posteriori. Because the inhomogeneous broadening
is due to the spatial variation of the EX energy on the scale of its
radius of a few nanometers, it can also vary on longer scales spatially
across the sample surface. Furthermore, because the homogeneous broadening
is also depending on this spatial variation, the measured pair (σ, γ)
is a spatially varying quantity on a length scale with a lower limit
given by the size of the sample region probed by the optical excitation,
and an upper limit given by the size of the investigated sample. The
spatial variations across the flake can be due to strain induced
by the substrate or encapsulating layers,31 the dielectric environment, the density of impurities and defects,
and the free carrier concentration. These mechanisms give rise to
the disorder, affecting EXs’ radiative rates32 and, thus, γ. The disordered potential landscape
results in varying EX localization lengths and produces different
sets of EX energy levels,33 determining
σ and affecting a population lifetime T1.

Enhanced spatial and temporal resolution is required
to experimentally
investigate the above issues. It is thus instructive to study TMD
SLs with FWM microspectroscopy, resolving the signal on a 100 femtosecond
(fs) time and a 300 nm spatial scale.29,30 In the employed
implementation, the exciting laser pulses propagate colinearly in
the same spatial mode, while the signal is discerned via optical heterodyning. This technique allows us to spatially resolve
σ and γ, revealing correlations between EX’s dephasing
and σ. The signal-to-noise ratio in this experiment is increased
compared with more traditional two-dimensional systems, such as GaAs
quantum wells, by the large oscillator strength μ of EXs in
MoS2 SLs. The latter allows to generate substantial multiphoton
nonlinear responses,34,35 including FWM as its field amplitude
and intensity scale as μ4 and μ8, respectively.

Results
In this work, we report
FWM microscopy of two heterostructures
composed of a SL MoS2 flake encapsulated by layers of high-quality h-BN.36 Details regarding sample
fabrication are provided in the Methods section.
In contrast to MoSe2,29 WSe2, and WS230 SLs, we
find that encapsulation is essential to observe a strong, coherent,
nonlinear optical response in exfoliated MoS2 SLs. By analyzing
the FWM transients acquired in the first investigated sample that
exhibits more disorder (sample A), we assess homogeneous and inhomogeneous
contributions to the EX spectral line-shape. We find that the encapsulation
leads to a global reduction of σ, down to a few meV, comparable
to the homogeneous broadening. In some micron-sized areas of the sample,
a decrease of σ correlated with an enhanced FWM signal can be
observed. We exploit the varying inhomogeneous broadening across the
sample to investigate the impact of EX disorder onto their coherence
dynamics, occurring at a picosecond (ps) time scale. The retrieved
correlations among σ, γ, μ, and T1 provide fundamental insights into EX localization and
dynamics in a disordered two-dimensional landscape. Using the second
sample, with significantly less disorder (sample B), we demonstrate
the EX optical response in its homogeneous limit. Taking advantage
of its high optical and structural quality, we show strong correlations
between above quantities. We then assess the phonon-induced homogeneous
broadening with increasing temperature and evaluate the excitation-induced
dephasing with increasing EX density. Finally, the dynamics of the
EX density after resonant excitation is unveiled. On a picosecond
time scale, we resolve an initially dominating radiative decay,29,37 competing with non-radiative redistribution into optically dark
states. The remaining EX density is scattered back to the optically
bright EX states and recombines (radiatively and non-radiatively)
assisted by a three-exciton decay process visible on a nanosecond
time scale. The coherent detection allows us to disentangle the EX
populations in the different bright and dark states. They create a
different phase of the response depending on the phase of the complex
EX renormalization of the optically probed bright EXs due to Coulomb
and exchange interaction with the total EX density. These contributions
involve different EX populations, each corresponding to charge carriers
in the inequivalent K and K’ valleys of the electronic band
structure.38 For example, broadening described
by an imaginary part of the interaction is in quadrature with energy
shifts described by the real part of the interaction. The different
relaxation processes contribute to the FWM amplitude with different
phases, imprinting unusual signatures in the measured density dynamics
of the FWM amplitude due to constructive and destructive interferences.38

Characterization with Linear Spectroscopy
The optical
pictograph of the sample A, containing an elongated MoS2 SL, displayed in Figure 1a, left panel, shows breaks (indicated by orange arrow) and
wrinkles (red arrow) in the flake as well as air trapped in bubbles
and puddles23 (yellow arrow). In spite
of these features, structurally clean areas extending across about
7 μm × 7 μm are found, such as the one enclosed with
a white dashed-contour. For the initial characterization at T = 5 K, we perform hyperspectral imaging of the confocal
PL (non-resonantly excited with a CW laser diode operating at 450
nm, with ∼10 μW arriving at the sample) across the spectral
range around the EX emission. The experiment reveals EX center energies
spanning across 30 meV, with a PL intensity varying over more than
an order of magnitude and different proportions of neutral (EX) and
charged (trion, TR) states, as shown in Figure S1. We also see zones in which both PL and reflectance of EX
are suppressed, while a characteristic spectrally broad band21 that was tentatively attributed to defects appears
below the EX energy. A spatial map of the PL intensity across the
entire flake for (636 ±  1) nm is shown in Figure 1a, right panel. Within
this region we identify areas containing quite narrow EX emission,
down to 7.1 meV fwhm, as exemplified in Figure 1b.

was fixed around 4 μW.

To inspect the linear coherent response, we performed microreflectance
from the same zone, showing resonances at EX and TR as well as the
B exciton, centered at ∼587 nm (not shown). In spite
of the substantial improvement of the optical response with respect
to previously examined free-standing MoS2 SLs,13,39 the EX line-shape in this h-BN/MoS2/h-BN heterostructure is still affected by σ.
To disentangle σ and γ, we employ three-beam FWM microscopy,
inferring EX coherence and population dynamics from femtosecond to
nanosecond time scales.

Coherence Dynamics via Four-Wave
Mixing Microscopy
FWM spectroscopy in the k-selection regime
of bare MoS2 SLs was reported in ref (28). Here, instead, we perform
heterodyne FWM microscopy30 in the configuration
briefly described in the Methods section.
A typical spectral interferogram
of the two-beam FWM field (proportional to , where  are
the fields of the exciting pulses)
from the neutral EX in our heterostructure, is presented in the green
trace in Figure 1c.
The measured spectrally integrated FWM intensity (amplitude squared)
as a function of the power of the first arriving pulse (), given
in Figure 1d, shows
a linear dependence, consistent
with the third-order regime of the FWM, up to 1 μW. The
latter corresponds to an excited EX density of around 109 cm–2 per pulse, which is around 4 orders
of magnitude below the EX saturation density in TMDs.

We now
turn to the assessment of σ and γ by inspecting the time-resolved
FWM amplitude as a function of τ12. The experimental
results are given in Figure 2, left panels. In panel a, we see that FWM is observed for
τ12 > 0 and already for τ12 >
0.2
ps takes a form of a Gaussian pulse centered close to t = τ12, i.e., the photon echo is
formed. In an ideal case of a set of two-level systems and for δ
pulses, the FWM signal for τ12 > 0, t > 0 can be described by a product of an exponential decay and
a
Gaussian shifting its maximum in time: |FWM(t, τ12)| ∝ exp[−τ12/T2] exp[−ν2(t–τ12)2/2). The echo has a constant temporal width,
with a standard deviation of 1/ν and fwhm of. This quantity is linked with the fwhm
of the spectral inhomogeneous broadening as . Conversely, the amplitude decay
of the
echo with increasing τ12 reflects the homogeneous
dephasing time T2 = 2ℏ/γ. The measured signal is convoluted with the temporal duration
of the applied pulses of about 150 fs, which is taken into account
in the modeling presented in Figure 2b. The two-dimensional fit to the experimental data
shown in panel a yields (γ, σ) = (2.10 
±  0.03, 12.5  ± 0.2) meV.
We note that the FWM amplitude at pulse overlap (τ12 = 0), encoded in the hue level, principally reflects the EX oscillator
strength μ.

e) Time-resolved
FWM amplitude for different delays τ12 at T = 5 K, showing formation of the photon echo. The disorder
is decreasing from top to bottom, quantified by the increase of γ
and decrease of σ. (b, d, f) Corresponding simulations.

To discuss the local character
of the quantities (γ, σ, μ),
let us now consider Figure 2e, where the FWM transient acquired within a distance of a
few micrometers from the spot considered in panel a is shown. Here,
the shape of the photon echo is different in several respects: (i)
it is broader in real time, showing that σ is smaller; (ii)
the amplitude decay along τ12 is faster, revealing
a shorter T2 (and thus larger γ);
and (iii) the amplitude around τ12 = 0 is larger
by an order of magnitude, showing a larger μ. These changes
are quantified by the fitted form of the echo, given in Figure 2f with the parameters (γ, σ)
= (3.10  ±  0.08, 5.5  ±  0.3) meV
at this position. It is worth noting that the response in panel e
already deviates form the echo form, i.e., the maximum
of the signal is not aligned along the diagonal, indicating a transition
to a homogeneously broadened case. When further approaching this limit,
the coherence dynamics displays a crossover from the photon echo toward
the free induction decay, resulting in the biexponential decay, as
discussed in the Figure S2. In Figure 2c, we present another
case of the measured echo, with the intermediate line-shape parameters
(γ, σ) = (2.60 ±  0.07, 7.7 
±  0.3) meV, as reflected by the simulation shown
in the panel d. These examples demonstrate that the EX optical response
is affected by the disorder on scales above and below the resolution
of the present experiment, 300 nm. Below this resolution, the disorder
leads to an effective inhomogeneous broadening of the response and
a reduction of the radiative decay rate by the localization of the
EXs below the optical resolution λ/2, thus leading to a mixing
of dark EX states outside the radiative cone. Above this resolution,
we can see the varying impact of disorder acting on EXs, as shown
in the three examples.

To verify if the encapsulation can be
used to virtually eliminate
σ, we have processed a second heterostructure (sample B), presented
in Figure S3. To exclude any aging issues,
the FWM spectroscopy was performed within hours after completing the
fabrication. At micron-sized areas, we measure FWM amplitude as narrow
as 4.4 meV (fwhm) at T = 4.5 K, as shown by filled-blue peak in Figure 3a. No signatures
of the photon echo can be noticed, when inspecting FWM transients versus τ12. Thus, here σ is not detectable
and the broadening reaches its homogeneous limit. In that limit, time-resolved
FWM takes a form of a free induction decay (FID), i.e., exponential decay from t = 0 for any τ12 > 0, with a decay constant determined by T2, as depicted by a scheme framed in panel b. A pair of
explicit examples of the measured FID at 4.5 K for τ12 = 0.04 ps (yellow arrow) and τ12 = 0.6 ps
(orange arrow) are given by the yellow and orange points in panel
a. By deconvoluting the laser pulse duration, we retrieve T2 = (320  ±  20) fs, i.e., γ = 4.11 meV, close to the fwhm of the
spectrally resolved amplitude, also in a stunning agreement with γ
retrieved from time-integrated FWM as a function of τ12, shifting the focus of the discussion to panel b. Interestingly,
therein at 4.5 and 10 K, we clearly detect the signal at negative
delays with a FWM rise time of around 130 fs (after deconvoluting
the pulse duration), close to theoretical prediction40 of T2/2. Such contributions
have previously been observed when studying homogeneously broadened
EXs in GaAs quantum wells and were assigned to the local-field effect.40

Figure 3 Exciton coherence dynamics in a MoS2 heterostructure
exhibiting low disorder (sample B), measured at different temperatures.
(a) Top: FWM transients vs τ12 at T = 4.5 and 34 K showing FWM free induction decay, thus
proving EX broadening in its homogeneous limit. Bottom: corresponding
FWM spectra measured for τ12 = 0.5 ps directly
showing the temperature-induced broadening. Red trace in the bottom-left
panel is the spectral shape of the reference pulse . (b) Time-integrated FWM amplitudes as
a function of τ12 measured for temperatures as indicated.
The dephasing time T2 is measured from
the exponential decay at τ12 > 0, and an increasing
influence of the phonon dephasing is observed when increasing the
temperature. At 4.5 K (blue circles), note the presence of the FWM
signal for τ12 < 0. Frame: a scheme of the three-pulse
FWM rephasing sequence employed to assess the coherence dynamics;
τ23 is set to zero in the experiment. In the homogeneous
limit (γ ≫ σ) of the EX broadening, FWM transient
is a free induction decay (FID) instead of the photon echo. (c) Temperature
dependence of γ retrieved from panel b (violet squares) compared
to the spectral fwhm of the FWM amplitude (open green squares). The
red curve is the fit to the data (see the main text).

A relevant factor influencing the EX coherent dynamics
is the temperature,
which determines the density of acoustic and optical phonons.41 Increasing the temperature, and thus the phonon
density, broadens γ by phonon-assisted scattering.27,29,30,42 However, the changing phonon-scattering influences the EX relaxation
dynamics.38 To measure the impact of temperature
on γ, we plot in Figure 3b the EX coherence dynamics, i.e., the time-integrated
FWM amplitude as a function of τ12, for different
temperatures. At this homogeneously broadened zone, the FWM amplitude
decays as exp(−τ12/T2). With increasing temperature from 5 to 70 K, we measure
shortening of the dephasing time and, thus, an increase of the homogeneous
broadening from 4 to 23 meV, as marked by violet squares in panel
c. In parallel, virtually the same broadening is seen in the FWM spectral
amplitudes (green open squares): to directly illustrate the dominance
of the homogeneous broadening mechanism through phonons at this sample
position, in the bottom-right part of panel a, we present the data
measured at 34 K. At higher temperatures, as exemplified for 90 K,
the dephasing is too fast to be measured with our current setup, limited
by the temporal resolution of around 150 fs. We fit the data with
a sum of a linear and exponential activation terms: γ(T) = γ0 + aT + b/[exp(E1/kBT)–1]. For the
linear term, attributed to acoustic phonons, we obtain γ0 = (3.78  ± 0.15) meV and a = (0.03  ±  0.01) meV/K. For the second
term we find b = (35 ±  12) meV
ad E1 = (8.3 ± 1.5) meV. In
contrast to previously inspected SL TMD,29,30 the value of activation E1 is here not
consistent with the energy of optical phonons41 of around 35 meV. We tentatively link such a more-pronounced temperature
dephasing with a particularly small conduction band splitting in MoS2, favoring the population loss of bright excitons through
their scattering to dark states.

While investigating dephasing
mechanisms in TMD SLs, it is also
instructive to determine the impact of EX–EX interactions on
γ. Such interactions cause the broadening27 of γ by 250% when increasing the EX density from
1010 to 1011 cm–2. In Figure 4 we present dephasing
curves measured for different excitaton powers P1,2,3, spanning across typically operating excitation range
in our experiments. With increasing EX density from around 108 to 109cm–2, we detect a small
but measurable increase of the homogeneous broadening by 15%; 0.5
meV over an order of magnitude
density. Because the absorption (thus also EX density for a fixed P1,2,3 value) may vary across the flake, it is
important to check that such excitation-induced dephasing is of minor
importance in the applied range of P1,2,3: values of γ retrieved from the analysis of the spatially
resolved FWM experiment, presented in the next section, are expected
not to be significantly affected by spatially fluctuating EX–EX
interactions.

Figure 4 Exciton coherence dynamics in a MoS2 heterostructure
exhibiting low disorder (sample B), measured at different excitation
powers. A stronger slope of the dephasing curves with increasing P1,2,3 is due to excitation-induced dephasing.
Within our range of P1,2,3, we measure
increase of γ by 0.5 meV when rising the EX density by an order
of magnitude.

Four-Wave Mixing Mapping
and Statistical Correlations
To draw a comprehensive picture
of the balance between the microscopic
disorder and the EX coherent dynamics, we go back to the more disordered
heterostructure (sample A, Figure 1). We use FWM imaging,30 measuring photon echos, as in Figure 2, at the grid of spatial points of the sample. For
each position, we perform two-dimensional measurements and fits as
in Figure 2, extracting
γ, σ, and the FWM amplitude, μ4. While
we note that these fits are not taking into account the interaction
induced nature of the signal, the resulting parameters mimic the response
well. These parameters are presented as color maps in Figure 5a–c. Within the investigated
region, γ (fwhm) spans from 1.8 to 4.3 meV. We see the spread
of σ (fwhm) from 4.7 to 16 meV, with the less disordered area
colored in green-blue in Figure 5a. This location also shows the strongest FWM amplitude,
proportional to μ4, as shown in Figure 5b. Note that the upper
limit of the measured σ is set by the spectral width of the
excitation laser.

Mapping
of the homogeneous broadening γ, the inhomogeneous broadening
σ, and of the FWM amplitude at τ12 = t = 0 proportional to μ4. The areas of
the weakest disorder yield the smallest σ, the shortest T2 and largest γ, as summarized in panel
e. Dashed lines in panels e and f are guides to eye. (d) Mapping of
σ retrieved from fitting the spectrally resolved FWM with a
Gaussian profile. (f) Correlation between the FWM amplitude measured
at τ12 = t = 0 and σ. (g)
Correlation between spectral FWM broadening and σ (as retrieved
from the FWM delay and temporal dynamics) is visible. The diagonal
is drawn with the dashed line.

A pronounced correlation between μ4 and
σ
is explicit in Figure 5f and quantified with a Pearson coefficient of . It is interpreted
as follows. Smaller
σ signifies weaker disorder enabling larger EX center-of-mass
localization lengths,33 thus generating
large EX coherence volume in real space. In the reciprocal space,
the EX wave function is thus dominated by small k-vector components
and, therefore, is better contained within the light cone. This increases
the light-matter interaction, and thus also μ, resulting in
an enhancement of the FWM signal. Instead, at areas showing large
σ, the EX spans more prominently out of the light cone. We emphasize
that the smaller overlap with the light-cone results in decreasing
μ (reflected by the FWM intensity) and increasing radiative
lifetime: instances of such qualitative dependencies among μ,
σ, and T1 are shown in Figure S4, while the statistical analysis of
this effect is discussed in Figure 6. Close to the radiative limit (T2 = 2T1), this implies an increase
of T2 and thus a decrease of the homogeneous
line width γ with increasing σ. We seek for such a (σ, γ)
correlation in Figure 5e. While some trend is visible, as marked with a dashed line, the
quantitative statistical correlation is low, with . We do observe
many points showing a short T2 and yet
a large σ. This is attributed
to other homogeneous broadening mechanisms, such as non-radiative
exciton-electron scattering, which vary across the investigated area.
We indeed checked that experimental points placed on the upper-right
quadrant in Figure. 5e are measured at the areas displaying trion transitions in PL and
thus exhibiting enhanced electron doping level.

Figure 6 Impact of the exciton
localization range on the homogeneous line
width and population decay rate measured at the low disorder limit.
(a) Correlation between σ and γ, demonstrating a decrease
of the homogeneous line width (increase of dephasing time T2) with increasing exciton localization range via disorder. (b) Correlation between σ and T1, demonstrating increase of the population
decay time T1 (composed of radiative and
non-radiative recombination channels) with increasing exciton localization
range via disorder. The measurements are performed
on sample B. Orange dashed lines are guides to eye.

We note that the low-disorder sample B does not
show any trion
absorption and emission and, thus, is characterized with a lower and
more-homogeneous residual electron doping. For this reason, we have
measured spatially resolved FWM, while also scanning τ12 and τ23 for each position, and performed correlation
analysis as on the Sample A. In Figure 6a, we present the resulting (σ, γ)
correlation. We unambiguously observe that with increasing σ,
from values close to zero up to around 10 meV, γ decreases
from 3 meV down to ≃1.5 meV. Quantitatively, the moderately
strong correlation is found reflected by . The final step
consists in conjugating
σ with the initial EX density decay, to which we attribute population
lifetime T1. The latter is inferred from
τ23 dependence (see Figure S4). The result is shown in Figure 6b. We observe that with increasing σ, T1 increases as well, generating a strong statistical
correlation with the Pearson coefficient . These experimental results obtained on
sample B, confirm our assertions regarding mutual dependencies between
μ, σ, γ and T1.

It is instructive to compare the parameters obtained through the
temporal dynamics with the ones from the spectra. In Figure 5d, we present the inhomogeneous
width (fwhm) of the Gaussian profiles we fit to the spectrally resolved
FWM data. We find agreement between the inhomogeneous width determined
by the FWM transients (panel a) and the spectral fwhm (panel d); the
correlation between both is shown in panel g. In Figure 7, we further exploit correlations
and demonstrate that σ, characterizing amount of disorder, increases
with the EX center energy (obtained from the spectra). This means
that the short-range (sub-resolution) disorder is dominating within
the probed region and is of repulsive nature.

Figure 7 Correlations between
the EX center energy, inhomogeneous σ,
and homogeneous broadening γ. One can observe that the center
energy varies within the line width. The center energy shifts by the
amount of σ, indicating that the disorder occurs on subresolution
scale and has a repulsive character. The measurement was performed
on sample A.

Population Dynamics on
a Nanosecond Scale
After the
resonant excitation, several relaxation mechanisms play an important
role.38 They are governed by, on the one
hand, the high oscillator strength43 and
thus fast radiative recombination rate and, on the other hand, by
the EX conversion toward different dark states, resulting from the
peculiar valley structure and available scattering channels with phonons,
charge carriers, and EXs. Due to this scattering and radiative recombination,
the EX phase is lost on a picosecond time scale, as shown by the results
discussed in the previous sections. Nonetheless, the EX population
in the dark states is evolving on a much longer time scale. Time-resolved
PL performed on TMD SLs typically shows tails in a range of a few
hundreds of picoseconds.44−47 The quantitative interpretation of PL dynamics is
difficult because there are many intermediate states in the scattering
pathway from the initially excited electron–hole pairs to the
emission of the bright EX states. Importantly, the occupation of dark
EX states is not directly observable, but can be inferred indirectly,
by modeling. Conversely, the experiments using phase-sensitive heterodyne
detection29,38 are sensitive not only to the bright EXs
but also to the dark ones through their interaction with the optically
probed bright EXs. Even more, the phase of the signal encodes the
phase of the complex interaction energy, enabling the distinction
between population of different dark-state reservoirs (fast direct
spin-allowed, direct spin-forbidden, indirect spin-allowed, and indirect
spin-forbidden).38 Furthermore, resonant
pumping generates a well-defined initial density of bright EXs (within
the light cone) with a given spin-state encoded by the light helicity.
Namely, the two pulses  and  (shifted
by the radio frequencies Ω1 and Ω2, respectively), arriving in time
overlap, create an EX density , oscillating at the frequency Ω2 – Ω1 = 1 MHz (see the Methods section). The FWM signal probing the density dynamics,
generated by the third pulse  delayed by τ23, infers
the amplitude and the phase of the resulting modulation of the excitonic
response. This pulse sequence is shown in Figure 8 together with a typical dynamics measured
at T = 5 K.

The excitation power for each beam is 0.3 μW. The amplitude
and phase retrieved by spectral interferometry are given by blue circles
and green squares, respectively, along with the simultaneous fit according
to the complex trial function (see discussion in the main text). Note
the complex character of the measured FWM observable, inducing interference
in the amplitude and phase-shifts revealing distinct densities scattering
processes, while varying τ23. Top: pulse sequence
employed to measure density dynamics via FWM. Data
acquired on the sample A.

Qualitatively, the data for different densities and temperatures,
as presented for FWM amplitudes in Figure S5, are consistently described by:1. a weak signal for negative times due
to previous pulses (repetition period is 13 ns), about 1 order of
magnitude below the signal at τ23 = 0;

2. a signal amplitude rise from the negative
delays τ23, given by the pulse autocorrelation, accompanied
by a −π/2 phase shift;

3. a decay of the amplitude to less than
half its value occurring for 0<τ23 < 1 ps;

4. subsequently, the signal
amplitude rises on a time scale of 10 ps, accompanied
by a phase shift
of about π/2; and

5. for τ23 > 10 ps
the amplitude decays, following a power law up to a delay of about
1 ns, while the phase shifts by about – π/2.



While the initial FWM decrease is attributed
to the EX radiative
recombination with the time constant given by τ1 and
simultaneous scattering to the dark states, its subsequent rise (with
additional features developing when increasing the temperature; see Figure S5) is surprising. To interpret the density
dynamics measured with the heterodyne FWM, we recall that the technique
retrieves response functions that are complex and, hence, sensitive
to both amplitudes and the relative phases of the components of the
signal R. Therefore the signals stemming from different
densities and different interaction processes (between different EX
states) interfere, which is visible when their relative contributions
change along the delay τ23. In the present case,
this effect is pronounced, indicating that the dynamics contains EX
densities with interaction energies of significantly different phases,
so that a description using a constant phase fails. In particular,
to describe our data set, we introduce the following complex response
function: 1  

The meaning of the parameters is explained in Table 1. The response function includes
a complex offset (Aof, ϕof), a two-photon absorption process (Anr, ϕnr) generating non-resonant FWM around τ23 = 0 and exponential decay processes, all multiplied by the
power law decay. Note that (An, ϕn) pairs represent amplitudes
and phases for the density scattering processes exhibiting exponential
decays with the time constants τn. We found that a minimum of three such processes were required for
a good fit to the data at 5 K, i.e., n ∈ (1, 2, 3). With increasing the temperature to 40 K, inclusion
of the fourth component was necessary to model the data (not shown).

Table 1 Set of Parameters for the Fit Shown
in Figure 8 Employing
the Response Function (eq 1)a
a The values marked
in blue correspond
to the most relevant physical parameters of the fit.

Additionally, the third line of
the above expression has been explicitly
added to describe the power law visible for longer delays τ23. Introducing this term is motivated by the observed power
law in the decay for different temperatures, and the fact that after
some time, the EX density will be thermalized and therefore described
by an overall decay process, which here appears to be EX–EX
scattering leading to a power-law decay. The fitting function accounts
for the temporal width of the excitation Gaussian pulses (τ0) and their repetition period (Tr) yielding this quite involved but analytical expression.

The
simultaneously fitted dynamics to the FWM amplitude and FWM
phase is shown by blue and green traces in Figure 8, respectively. We interpret it as follows.
The initial drop is governed by the radiative recombination of EXs
in the light cone competing with scattering out of the light cone
leading to a fast decay with τ1 = T1 = (0.13  ± 0.04) ps. Later dynamics
are characterized by τ2 = (4.2  ±  1.4) ps
and comparable amplitude (A1 ≈
0.62 × A2). Populating the indirect
dark EXs results in the rise of FWM amplitude and produces a phase-shift
due to modified interaction with the bright EXs. This is followed
by the overall density decay via EX–EX scattering
into a photon and a bright EX or nonradiative Auger recombination.
To rephrase, in this model, the FWM rise (quantified by the second
process with the parameters τ2, A2, and ϕ2) is due to the scattering of
EXs into states with a stronger interaction with the probed bright
EXs (for example, spin-forbidden direct or indirect EXs). We speculate
that, within the TMD family, such scattering from bright toward dark
EX configuration is the most efficient in MoS2 SLs, owing
to its particularly small conduction band splitting,48 giving a reason why it is much more pronounced here with
respect to MoSe2 SLs.38 After
10 ps, this process is completed and the subsequent decay dynamics
is ruled by the power law with the power α = 0.59 ±  0.05.
This value corresponds to a decay rate proportional to the EX density
with the power 1 + 1/α ≈ 2.7 ≈ 3 and thus indicates
triexciton scattering as dominating decay mechanism. The remaining
third exponential process yields the decay constant τ3 = (56  ± 18) ps and A3 ≈ 1.4 × A1, comparable to A1. We found that, while restricting the modeling
to the first two decay processes one can describe the FWM amplitude
dynamics reasonably well (not shown), the third decay process was
necessary to fit the phase dynamics. This exemplifies how the phase
observable contains additional information, otherwise obscured when
considering the FWM amplitude only. This third process is tentatively
attributed to a further redistribution between the different dark
exciton states, as suggested by the different phase of the resulting
interaction.

Conclusions
We have shown that encapsulating
MoS2 SLs in between h-BN layers drastically
improves the optical quality in
this material and permits us to recover giant coherent nonlinear responses
of the EXs, as expected from their oscillator strength. Using two
heterostructures differing in the degree of the EX disorder, we have
performed three-beam FWM to infer the EX coherent and incoherent dynamics,
spanning time scales from 100 fs to 1.3 ns. By measuring the coherence
dynamics and time-resolved FWM, we reveal the formation of the photon
echos, extracting homogeneous γ and inhomogeneous σ contributions
to the EX spectral line-shape. We directly show the correlation between
σ and the measured initial population loss, indicating that
the latter is affected by the change in radiative lifetime on top
of non-radiative channels. Importantly, at some positions of the low-disorder
sample, the FWM transient appears in the form of interaction dominated
free-induction decay, with no evidence of photon echo formation, showing
that the EX broadening in the probed region is virtually homogeneous.
FWM microscopy allowed us to reveal the impact of the local disorder
on the EX’s oscillator strength and line-shape. The latter
is shown to be affected by the temperature and also weakly by the
excitation induced dephasing due to EX–EX interaction. The
EX density dynamics measured by FWM is sensitive to both the dark
and the bright EX density and can recover the complex interaction
energy with the bright EXs using the amplitude and phase of the signal.
Employing the modeling with complex fitting function, we identified
three major EX relaxation channels, specifically: radiative decay
and scattering out of the light cone (into fast EXs), scattering into
dark EXs, which subsequently decay via tri-EX
scattering. Further FWM transient grating investigations, thoroughly
addressing a large space of parameters (the temperature, injected
exciton density, valley-polarization, distinct TMD SL materials, exhibiting
optically bright and dark exciton ground states, as well as the charge
state, neutral EXs versus trions) are necessary to
draw a comprehensive picture of the exciton relaxation dynamics. This
would enable us to elaborate more accurate and predictive models,
yet also more involved, with respect to the one presented in this
work. To consistently describe the measured rich EX relaxation dynamics,
one could for example incorporate master equations, modeling the dynamics
between the different EX reservoirs.

Our methodology is well-suited
to accurately assessing the impact
of disorder on the EX responses in experiments with forthcoming TMD
heterostructures. In particular, with the suppressed structural disorder,
we could access and measure the coherent dynamics, mutual couplings
and lifetime of the EX excited states. Finally, using spatially resolved
FWM configuration would enable us to demonstrate long-range propagation
of the coherence and of the exciton–polariton diffusion. The
latter aspects are of utmost importance to reveal the exciton dispersion
curve in optically active van der Waals structures.49

Methods
Preparation of the MoS2 van der Waals Heterostructure
In the present two
samples, A and B, the natural MoS2 crystals were purchased
from SPI, and the h-BN
crystals were obtained from NIMS, Japan. The Si/SiO2 substrates
with a 295 nm thick oxide were cleaned using acetone and isopropyl
alcohol followed by nitrogen blow-drying. For the sample A (with more
disorder), we used a viscoelastic stamping method for the stack preparation,
while for the sample B (with less disorder), we employed a pick-up
technique.

For the sample A, the h-BN crystal
was placed on a scotch tape and was mechanically exfoliated onto a
Si/SiO2 substrate, whereas the MoS2 crystal
was exfoliated onto a PDMS layer. It has been already shown that large
area monolayer MoS2 flakes could be obtained by exfoliating
on PDMS.50 A large SL MoS2 flake
(15 × 80 μm2) was identified on PDMS
based on optical contrast and was aligned and transferred onto the h-BN flake on Si/SiO2 by viscoelastic stamping,
which is a dry method.51 Likewise, another h-BN flake exfoliated on PDMS was stamped over the monolayer
MoS2, so as to encapsulate it and to obtain a h-BN/MoS2/h-BN van der Waals heterostructure.
While this process is known to yield a clean MoS2/h-BN interface at the bottom, the top interface with h-BN may encapsulate air blisters, puddles, and cracks.
These may form as a result of the exerted mechanical stress, but a
low amount of contaminants is expected.

For the less-disordered
sample B, we use the so-called polypropylene
carbonate (PPC) technique. The top and bottom h-BN
and also the MoS2 are exfoliated onto Si/SiO2 substrates, respectively. Monolayer MoS2 and 15–20
nm thick h-BN flakes are identified using an optical
microscope. Using a micron-thin film of PPC polymer top h-BN, monolayer MoS2 and the bottom h-BN
are picked up one after another to form h-BN/MoS2/h-BN heterostructure using the procedure
introduced in ref (55).

Four-Wave Mixing Microscopy
To measure coherent, resonant
responses, particularly FWM spectra, we use heterodyne spectral interferometry.52,53 We employ three laser pulses generated by the optical parametric
oscillator (Radiantis Inspire) pumped by a Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics,
Tsunami Femto). The pulses are chirp-corrected using a geometrical
pulse-shaper, such that they arrive at the sample close to their Fourier
limit, with around 150 fs duration. The beams are labeled  and are resonant with the EX transition,
as displayed in Figure 1c (black trace). They are focused on the sample with the microscope
objective (NA = 0.6) down to the diffraction limit.  are frequency upshifted by distinct radio-frequencies
Ω1,2,3 around 80 MHz using acousto-optic deflectors.
The reflectance is collected by the same objective and spectrally
dispersed by an imaging spectrometer. By exploiting optical heterodyning,
we select the field component proportional to the FWM polarization
proportional to , which
is carried by the heterodyne beating
at the Ω3 + Ω2 – Ω1 frequency, also occurring around 80 MHz. By applying the
acousto-optic downshift for this mixing frequency at the detection
path, the FWM spectral interference detected by a CCD camera is observed
as a non-oscillating (DC) signal. Using a defined time-ordering between
signal and reference pulses, the signal is resolved in amplitude and
phase using spectral interferometry,54 providing
the signal in both spectral and temporal domains connected via Fourier transform. By measuring the FWM as a function
of time delays τ12 (between  and ) and
τ23 (between  and ), we
gain information about the EX coherence
and density dynamics, respectively.
