The
highly localized sensitivity of metallic nanoparticles sustaining
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enables detection of minute
events occurring close to the particle surface and forms the basis
for nanoplasmonic sensing. To date, nanoplasmonic sensors typically
consist of two-dimensional (2D) nanoparticle arrays and can therefore
only probe processes that occur within the array plane, leaving unaddressed
the potential of sensing in three dimensions (3D). Here, we present
a plasmonic metasurface comprising arrays of stacked Ag nanodisks
separated by a thick SiO2 dielectric layer, which, through
rational design, exhibit two distinct and spectrally separated LSPR
sensing peaks and corresponding spatially separated sensing locations
in the axial direction. This arrangement thus enables real-time plasmonic
sensing in 3D. As a proof-of-principle, we successfully determine
in a single experiment the layer-specific glass transition temperatures
of a bilayer polymer thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA,
and poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(methacrylic acid), P(MMA-MAA).
Our work thus demonstrates a strategy for nanoplasmonic sensor design
and utilization to simultaneously probe local chemical or physical
processes at spatially different locations. In a wider perspective,
it stimulates further development of sensors that employ multiple
detection elements to generate distinct and spectrally individually
addressable LSPR modes.

The localized
surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR)1 occurring in metal nanoparticles
forms the basis for applications that include photocatalysis,2,3 surface-enhanced spectroscopy,4,5 and sensing.6,7 Particularly for sensing, LSPR functionality is enabled by the sensitivity
of the enhanced electromagnetic field extending from the nanoparticle
surface to a change in the refractive index (RI) of the surrounding
medium. Furthermore, the fact that the enhanced field decays very
rapidly8 offers a unique situation where
the LSPR only probes a minute volume (i.e., the sensing
volume) in close vicinity of the particle surface and thus allows
detection of a wide range of processes that include molecular interactions
and material transformation within that volume. Ever since the first
demonstration of the nanoplasmonic sensing concept by Englebienne9 two decades ago, it has developed into a major
subfield of plasmonics and has found wide applications such as in
bio- and chemosensing6,7,10,11 and in materials science.12,13 This, in turn, has spurred the development of a large library of
plasmonic nanostructures tailored for various sensing purposes.6,14−16 However, as a review of the corresponding literature
shows, nanoplasmonic sensors to the largest extent only comprise two-dimensional
(2D) arrays of a single type of plasmonic particle on a support. Consequently,
they can only detect processes that occur within the plane of the
array. This leaves unaddressed the potentially widely relevant concept
of plasmonic sensors that could simultaneously probe multiple locations
in three-dimensional (3D) space. The implementation of such a concept
would, however, unlock access to intriguing opportunities, such as
to accurately and simultaneously scrutinize spatially varying processes
occurring at the nanoscale in 3D. This is of high interest, for example,
in nanomaterials science because material properties often are locally
unique and may depend on the spatial location inside the material.17 Considering the traits of nanoplasmonics, in
principle, such a sensing concept could be enabled by distributing
in 3D geometrically dissimilar plasmonic particles that exhibit LSPR
at different wavelengths, to render them spectrally addressable simultaneously.
However, to the best of our knowledge, such a 3D plasmonic sensing
concept has never been realized, despite a number of works that demonstrate
plasmonic sensors comprising multiantennas18−21 or active plasmonic particles
protruding far away from the support.22,23

Here,
to introduce such a 3D sensing platform conceptually envisioned
above, we present a plasmonic metasurface which consists of a quasi-random
array of nanoarchitectures comprising two plasmonic nanoparticles
with spectrally separated resonance wavelengths. The plasmonic nanoparticles
are separated vertically by a thick dielectric layer in a stack that
protrudes from the support. As we show using both experiments and
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, this enables simultaneous
and independent sensing at the corresponding plasmonic particle locations
in the 3D stack. To demonstrate the functionality of the sensor in
a materials science application recently introduced,24−29 we simultaneously characterize the layer-specific glass transition
temperatures of stacked poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, and poly(methyl
methacrylate)/poly(methacrylic acid), P(MMA-MAA), copolymer thin films
in a single experiment.

Results and Discussion
We designed
the metasurface to comprise a quasi-random array of
truncated SiO2 nanocone structures, which contain vertically
separated and differently sized plasmonically active Ag nanodisks
at their base and at their tip (Figure 1a). These disks then function as independent antennas
that exclusively probe their particular surroundings. This independent
function requires sufficient spatial separation between the disks
to minimize near-field coupling, and that they exhibit LSPR spectrally
separated enough that two independent “peaks” can be
resolved in their optical spectrum. With respect to the latter requirement,
we aimed to have both LSPR peaks within the visible
to near-infrared (NIR) spectral range (i.e., 400–1100
nm) to comply with the most commonly used optical components in the
field.6 With this constraint at hand, the
choice of the metal for the sensing antennas is practically restricted
to Ag, which features a narrow LSPR peak and a high interband absorption
onset (3.8 eV or ∼325 nm, i.e., beyond the
designed wavelength range).30−32 This is superior to Au, which
exhibits broader LSPR modes and has a lower interband transition threshold
energy (2.3 eV or ∼540 nm).30,33 Utilizing
Ag thus provides more room for the design of the antennas’
dimensions while maximizing their spatial separation in order to produce
two spectrally well-separated LSPR peaks.

comprising 3D nanostructures with (red) and without (blue) the top
disk. Two spectrally well-separated peaks are apparent for the 3D
sensor, corresponding to the top (short wavelengths) and bottom (long
wavelengths) disks. Absence of the top disk in the 3D structures (blue)
only results in the absence of the short wavelengths peak, whereas
the peak corresponding to the bottom disk is unaffected, corroborating
little to no crosstalk between the top and bottom disks. (e) FDTD-simulated
optical extinction spectra of 3D sensors, corroborating the experimental
findings presented in (d). Also shown are the extinction spectra of
a sensor with only top disk (green) and sum of the extinction of the
sensor with only bottom disk and sensor with only top disk (cyan).

To fabricate this sensor architecture, we employed
the hole-mask
colloidal lithography (HCL) nanofabrication method.34 Due to the fact that the rim of the mask shrinks during
material deposition,35 HCL fabrication
generates tapered, instead of straight-walled, nanostructures. This
provides a situation where subsequent deposition of metal–dielectric–metal
multilayers through the mask naturally produces vertically separated
metal nanodisks with different diameter (hence different LSPR wavelength),
which is directly controlled by the chosen vertical separation in
the stack. Additionally, fine-tuning of the exact resonance wavelength
of each antenna is controlled by its thicknesses. For the present
case, we have optimized these structures such that the corresponding
metasurface comprises a quasi-random array of truncated nanocones.
They have an average base diameter of 210 nm that corresponds to the
first Ag nanodisk (“bottom”) with 20 nm thickness, separated
by 90 nm SiO2 from a second Ag disk at the tip of the structure
(“top”) with a diameter of ∼80 nm and a thickness
of 30 nm (Figure 1a–c).

Measuring the optical extinction spectrum of a metasurface containing
these nanostructures reveals the intended distinct and well-separated
two LSPR peaks within the targeted wavelength range: one at 860 nm
(bottom disk) and another at 535 nm (top disk; Figure 1d). To confirm that the disks are not coupled via their near-fields, we also fabricated an identical metasurface
with the bottom disk and cone structure but without the top disk.
As shown in Figure 1d, the extinction spectrum of such a system is identical except for the short wavelength range where the top disk
LSPR peak is lacking. In other words, removing (or adding) the top
disk from (to) the 3D structure does not alter the optical response
of the bottom disk. Also, increasing the spatial separation between
bottom and top disk to 100 nm only results in the change of the top
disk LSPR peak (due to smaller diameter), whereas the response of
the bottom disk remains, for practical purpose, unchanged (Figure S1). This contrasts reported cases of
coupled systems, where spectral features that depend on a non-negligible
coupling strength and not only on the constituent antennas can be
observed36,37 (see also Figure S1 where we shorten the distance between the disks to 60 nm). Furthermore,
FDTD simulations of a single 3D nanostructure reproduce accurately
the experimental observations and thus further corroborate the lack
of near-field coupling between the disks (Figure 1e). We note that the LSPR peak in the simulation
is broader than the experimental one, contrary to what one expects
due to the size variation in individual nanostructures in ensemble
measurements. We recall that the optical response of our amorphous
arrays (quasi-random with short-range order) is determined by the
single-particle response which, however, is modified by the stochastically
scattered fields by other nanoparticles.38,39 The magnitude and sign of the stochastic interference of the scattered
fields with the incident one are determined by the particle minimum
center-to-center distance (see Figure S3 for our metasurface). These result in either a red or blue shift
of the single-particle resonance position, narrowing or broadening
of the peak width, and corresponding change of the amplitude.40,41 This interaction is the origin of a majority of the differences
between the experimental and simulated response, whereas additional
factors originate from using a tabulated permittivity for Ag which
is likely close to, but not exactly equal to, experiments as well
a minor geometrical difference between the modeling and experiment.

Having established the metasurface nanoarchitecture as such, we
now turn to assessing the Ag antennas for practical sensing applications.
As a first step to enable this, we address the fact that Ag is prone
to oxidation by adopting one of the concepts of indirect nanoplasmonic
sensing,42 in which a thin coating film
is applied to the sensing structure in order to protect it from the
environment and permit application also in demanding chemical environments
as well as at high temperatures. Furthermore, application of such
a thin coating also provides a chemically uniform surface, which is
of importance in sensing applications where the interaction between
the sensor surface and analyte is critical for the behavior of the
latter. Here, we choose Si3N4 as the coating
material due to its low permeability toward oxygen and its high temperature
stability.43 Specifically, employing plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD), we apply a conformal 10 nm thin
Si3N4 coating on the entire metasurface (Figure 2a), which still preserves
its distinguishable LSPR peaks (Figure S2).

Figure 2 Coating of the 3D metasurface and its stability. (a) False-colored
SEM image of a 3D sensor plasmonic metasurface coated with a 10 nm
Si3N4 layer (violet). Also shown is the to-scale
schematic of the coated sensor. Scale bar is 200 nm. Wavelength-resolved
temporal evolution of optical extinction of (b) uncoated and (c) Si3N4-coated 3D sensors as a function of increasing
temperature up to 600 °C under constant flow of 2% O2 in Ar. The dashed lines denote the spectral peak maximum, λpeak, of the bottom and top disks. For the uncoated sensor,
the bottom and top disk LSPR peaks vanish around 500 and 550 °C,
respectively, due to complete oxidation. Extended 2 h exposure to
2% O2 in Ar at 600 °C is also shown for the (d) uncoated
and (e) coated sensors. Evidently, the Si3N4 coating excellently protects the Ag nanodisks from oxidation even
at very harsh conditions. (f,g) Room temperature extinction spectra
of an uncoated and coated metasurface, respectively, before and after
the heating/oxidation test.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the Si3N4 coating
to protect the Ag nanoparticle elements of the metasurface
from oxidizing, we devised an experiment to assess the coated sensor’s
stability under oxidizing conditions at high temperature. Specifically,
we exposed a coated metasurface, along with an uncoated control, to
a flow of 2% O2 in Ar carrier gas while slowly increasing
the temperature to 600 °C and simultaneously measured the evolution
of their extinction spectra (Figure 2b,c). Starting from a comparable extinction spectrum
profile, both LSPR peaks of the uncoated sensor blue shift more pronouncedly
than the ones of the coated sensor as the temperature increases to
∼450 °C. Apart from this minor shift, the intensity of
the peaks appears to be unaffected up to this temperature, hinting
that the Ag disks are not oxidized.44 The
observed spectral changes are thus explained by the reshaping of the
sensors induced by heat45 (in contrast
to heat-induced particle expansion that causes the LSPR red shift
in isotropic or thermally stable particles,46,47 which we also observed for subsequent heating ramps, after the initial
reshaping; see Figure S5), which expectedly
happens to a lower degree for the coated system thanks to the good
thermal stability of Si3N4 that prevents (major)
reshaping of the encapsulated Ag disks. When heating progresses to
∼500 °C, the optical response from the uncoated top disk
abruptly diminishes and is soon followed by the bottom disk at ∼550
°C, both signaling the complete oxidation and thus loss of plasmonic
response. In contrast, for the coated system, extended heating up
to 600 °C only prolongs the slight blue shift of the LSPR peaks
observed above, and even with an additional 2 h of O2 exposure
at 600 °C, it does not alter its response (Figure 2d–g). The overall slight blue shift
after cooling back to room temperature (Figure 2g) can be assigned to minor reshaping, as
confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images taken before
and after the experiment (Figure S4).

After confirming the structural and plasmonic integrity of the
Si3N4-coated metasurface (hereafter referred
to as the metasurface), we now turn to characterize
its sensing properties. Aided by FDTD simulations, we start by mapping
the extension of electromagnetic field enhancement for top and bottom
disk elements in air. The corresponding field enhancement profiles
calculated by FDTD at the resonance wavelength of the respective disk
for normal-incidence plane wave illumination are shown in Figure 3a,b. It becomes clear
that field enhancement is observed exclusively at the position of
the resonating Ag disk element for the two irradiation wavelengths,
and that there is no spatial overlap (Figure S6), further corroborating the anticipated independent local sensitivity
of each disk.8 Shortening the separation
between the disks, we found that the fields are coupled for the spacer
layer thickness of less than 70 nm (Figures S7 and S8); hence, it corresponds to the minimum separation distance
for the 3D sensor fabricated using the method and base diameter here
to exhibit the independent spatial sensing function. Finally, we also
note that the spatial distribution of the field enhancement exhibits
an asymmetry, which is a consequence of the higher RI of both the
substrate and the SiO2 layer between the disks.48,49

at the resonance wavelength of the (a) top and (b) bottom disks in
air, normalized to the incoming field strength. Evidently, the near-fields
of the top and bottom disks excited at their corresponding LSPR wavelengths
do not spatially overlap with the nonexcited particle, corroborating
little to no coupling between them and thus that they are able to
independently sense a nearby event excited simultaneously at their
respective LSPR wavelength. (c) Bulk refractive index sensitivity
and (d) enhanced field decay length, δ, in air determination
for bottom and top disks. The decay lengths further quantify the non-overlapping
fields of the bottom and top disks as their sum is smaller than the
distance between the disks (i.e., 76 vs 90 nm). Overall, the top disk displays high sensitivity despite
its small size, due to a large accessible sensing volume because of
its location on a pillar.48

We also experimentally quantify two key sensing characteristics
of each of the sensor disks, namely, their bulk refractive index sensitivity
(BRIS) and their local/thin film sensitivity. The BRIS, expressed
as nm/refractive index unit (RIU), is derived by tracking the peak
shifts of the bottom and top disks, Δλpeak,
as the metasurface is exposed to liquid media with varying RI (Figure 3c). Clearly, each
disk responds independently and differently (see raw data in Figure S9) and thus exhibits different BRIS (i.e., 133 and 180 nm/RIU for bottom and top disks, respectively).
To this end, it is interesting to discuss the higher sensitivity of
the top disk compared to that of the bottom one despite the smaller
size of the former, as it has been shown both experimentally and theoretically
that BRIS and plasmonic antenna size are, in general, positively correlated.50,51 The exceptionally high sensitivity in the top disk in the present
case is a direct consequence of its position on top of a SiO2 pillar, which exposes a larger fraction of its sensing volume compared
to a disk located on a flat support48,49 (Figure S12). This picture is consistent with
the simulated enhanced field mapping discussed above (cf. Figure 3a,b).

To quantify
the local or thin film sensitivity of the disks in
air, we set out to determine their field decay lengths, δ, experimentally.
This decay length marks the distance at which the field intensity
decays to 1/e of that of the one on the disk surface.
Hence, by definition, it signifies a boundary between the sensing
volume within which sensitivity is high and the volume further away
from the disk surface within which sensitivity rapidly decreases.52 To experimentally determine these decay lengths,
we subsequently deposit ultrathin Al2O3 films
by atomic layer deposition and map the Δλpeak induced by the deposition of each layer (Figure 3d; see also Supporting Information for the experimental details and derivation). It
is clear that the bottom and top disks display similar Δλpeak up to ∼50 nm Al2O3. For thicker
coatings, the Δλpeak of the top disk is higher
than that of the bottom one. This is translated to a longer decay
length of the top disk (δtop= 49
nm) compared to that of the bottom one (δbottom= 27 nm), which once more is a direct consequence of the
top disk position on top of the SiO2 pillar. The derived
decay lengths also provide a quantitative validation for the lack
of near-field coupling between the disks as their sum is smaller than
the distance between the disks (i.e., 76 vs 90 nm). This is in very good agreement with the FDTD
simulations discussed above (cf. Figure 3a,b, and also see Figure S6). In general, the decay lengths become shorter when the
metasurface is embedded in a medium with higher RI due to the higher
optical density (Figures S10 and S11).

As the final step of our evaluation and as a proof-of-principle
of our envisioned 3D sensing functionality, we designed an experiment
to extract the thermophysical properties of multilayer polymer thin
films by attempting to simultaneously determine the glass transition
temperatures, Tg, of the individual layers. Tg is the temperature below which a polymer is
in a glassy state.53 Such thin polymer
multilayer systems are of high relevance in organic electronics54,55 and organic photovoltaics.56,57 In these applications,
device performance is strongly affected by the thermal stability of
constituent polymers, which in turn is characterized by their Tg.58,59 For our proof-of-principle
experiments, we here choose PMMA and its corresponding copolymer P(MMA-MAA)
because they possess similar optical properties (transparent in the
visible–NIR range and RI of 1.49, as measured by ellipsometry;
see Figure S13) and yet are expected to
have different thermophysical properties due to the stronger bonding
between the monomers in the copolymer.60,61

To prepare
the samples, we use a combination of spin coating and
plasma etching (see details in Methods and
also Figure S14) to subsequently deposit
flat (i.e., not conformal to the 3D
sensor structure) P(MMA-MAA) and PMMA films, such that each of the
polymer layers only encapsulates one of the disks. Specifically, we
deposit first 70 nm of P(MMA-MAA), such that its surface levels roughly
at the middle of the SiO2 spacer layer of the 3D sensor
nanostructure, followed by 90 nm of PMMA, to have the top disk fully
embedded at its center (see Figure 4a for the to-scale schematic). Combined analysis using
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry confirms the flat and
nonconformal profile of the obtained films, as well as their respective
position along the height of the 3D sensor nanoarchitecture (Figure 4b). Tg determination is then carried out by heating the embedded
metasurface under Ar flow (see Methods) and
tracking individually the Δλpeak response of
the two disks. Due to the thermal expansion of the polymers with increasing
temperature,24 we observe that both Δλpeak signals initially blue shift linearly upon heating. The
absolute magnitude of Δλpeak is slightly different
due to the combination of slightly different BRIS of the top and bottom
disks identified above and the thermal expansion coefficient of the
polymers. Then, when the temperature reaches ∼115 °C,
the Δλpeakversus temperature
trend of the top disk adopts a different slope, suggesting that the
PMMA surrounding it has transformed from the “glassy”
to a “rubbery” state24 and
thus has undergone a glass transition characterized by Tg PMMA. Interestingly, the Δλpeak evolution of the bottom disk is unaffected at this temperature as
it proceeds to blue shift with a constant slope, until the temperature
reaches ∼128 °C. At this temperature, a distinct change
in slope occurs (and vice versa the Δλpeak slope of top disk is constant), signifying the copolymer
transition temperature, Tg P(MMA-MAA). This finding has important implications as it clearly demonstrates
the ability of the 3D sensor to measure individually and simultaneously
the properties of the two stacked polymer thin films. In all of these
cases, the derived Tg values are in excellent
agreement with those in the literature for films of the same thicknesses,24,28,42,61,62 as well as with our own reference measurements
using a conventional 2D indirect nanoplasmonic sensor24 (Figure S15). To this end, the
higher Tg in the copolymer is a manifestation
of its stronger monomer bonds.60,61

Figure 4 Glass transition temperature
measurements of layered polymer thin
films. (a) To-scale schematic of the studied system. The metasurface
is coated with layered films of P(MMA-MAA) copolymer and PMMA, each
encapsulating only one of the sensing disks. (b) AFM profiles of a
single bare 3D sensor nanoarchitecture (black) and the same sensor
covered with a layer of P(MMA-MAA) (blue) and PMMA (green). The profiles
of the polymer layers are shifted vertically to their corresponding
thicknesses measured using ellipsometry to mimic the actual configuration.
Plotting the AFM data this way confirms that each disk is only encapsulated
by one of the polymers in the layered structure. (c) Simultaneous Tg determination of the two polymer layers in
the film by using the Δλpeak readouts obtained
as a function of temperature from top and bottom disks. Solid and
dashed gray lines represent linear fits to the data and corresponding
95% confidence intervals, respectively. A change in the slope indicates Tg,24 as denoted by
the colored dashed lines, with the error range related to the fitting
marked by the colored areas. Distinct Tg is identified for both layers with that of copolymer being higher,
in agreement with the literature.61 (d) Tg determined from the response of the top and
bottom disks for various polymer layer configurations. Consistent Tg are found for all configurations. Error bars
mark the 95% confidence interval of the fitting.

To further validate the obtained Tg values
and corroborate the independent sensing functionality of
bottom and top disks in the 3D sensor metasurface, we carried out
similar measurements for three other polymer layer configurations
with identical total thickness: (i) PMMA–P(MMA-MAA) layered
films, (ii) only P(MMA-MAA), and (iii) only PMMA (the last two cases
have a single polymer layer covering both bottom and top disks; see Figure 4d). As summarized
in Figure 4d, it is
obvious that both disks in the sensor are able to accurately determine
the Tg values of the polymers, irrespective
of how they are arranged. Specifically, consistent Tg P(MMA-MAA) and Tg PMMA are found to be ∼128 and ∼115 °C, respectively
(raw data in Figure S16).

Finally,
we highlight that our measurements above represent the
state-of-the-art for successful simultaneous determination of the Tg of individual thin (i.e.,
a few tens to hundreds of nanometers) polymer films in a multilayer
configuration. Previously, it was only possible to extract the Tg of only a single polymer
layer in a stack. This was achieved by doping a fluorescent label
into the polymer of interest,17,63,64 whose properties accordingly may have been altered by the presence
of the label.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
developed a plasmonic metasurface for nanoscale
sensing in three dimensions, capable of detecting independently and
simultaneously minute changes at two different locations in three-dimensional
space. We achieved this function by vertically stacking in a 3D nanoarchitecture
two plasmonic Ag nanodisks with dimensions sufficiently different
to ensure spectrally well-separated LSPR modes in the visible–NIR
range and by spatially putting them apart by a dielectric SiO2 spacer thick enough to decouple their near-fields. Integrating
these nanostructures in a large-area quasi-random array on a flat
surface generated a plasmonic metasurface for optical sensing in three
dimensions. By further applying a thin conformal Si3N4 coating to the metasurface, we were able to achieve both
thermal and chemical stability in highly oxidizing conditions at up
to 600 °C and uniform surface chemistry. Applying it to study
the thermal properties of a thin polymer bilayer structure comprising
stacked PMMA and P(MMA-MAA) films enabled the accurate and simultaneous
determination of the glass transition temperatures of the individual
thin polymer layers inside the stack.

Beyond the demonstrated
application for characterization of thermal
properties of multilayer thin polymer films, we predict numerous potential
cases where our 3D sensing platform may be utilized, for example,
characterization of nanomaterials that exhibit physical or chemical
property gradients,17,65 diffusion/intercalation processes
in a (porous) matrix,66−68 and the discrimination of events occurring at different
spatial locations (e.g., inside vs outside) of a biological system.69−71 Furthermore, using an
imaging technique capable of collecting optical spectra with in-plane
spatial resolution (e.g., hyperspectral imaging),
true spatially resolved 3D sensing can be realized. Finally, in a
wider perspective, we hope that our work here will inspire further
development of nanoplasmonic sensors that utilize multiple types of
nanoparticles with spectrally distinguishable, and thus individually
and simultaneously addressable, LSPR modes to facilitate applications
where they are to function either individually18,19 or collectively.20

Methods
Metasurface
Nanofabrication
The details of the hole-mask
colloidal lithography process undertaken to produce the sensors on
both glass and silicon (e.g., materials, fabrication
steps) is described elsewhere.72 Specific
to the current work, the subsequent deposition of the Ag–SiO2–Ag layers through the hole-mask was done in a Lesker
PVD 225 evaporator with 1 Å/s deposition rate at a base pressure
of 5 × 10–7 Torr. The
thin conformal Si3N4 coating film was deposited
in an STS PE-CVD system.

Metasurface Characterization
All
SEM images were taken
on surfaces fabricated on silicon and obtained in a Zeiss Supra 60
VP with secondary electron detector, a working distance <5 mm,
and an electron beam acceleration voltage of 5 kV. AFM profile measurements
were done in tapping mode in air using an SPM Bruker Dimension 3100.
Optical extinction spectra were collected using a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer on samples fabricated on borofloat glass substrates.

Multilayer Thin Polymer Film Deposition
PMMA and P(MMA(8.5)-MAA)
(both from MicroChem, Mw = 950 000)
were utilized. We note that spin coating of the polymer with spinning
parameters corresponding to the intended thickness resulted in the
deposition of the polymer all over the sensor, including the 3D nanostructures
in a conformal way.24,73 Thus, to obtain a flat polymer
film with a protruding top part of the 3D nanostructure, a thick (>500
nm) film was first spin coated on the sensor. The chosen thickness
is deliberately much higher than the 3D sensor nanostructures to obtain
a completely flat surface without protrusions due to the underlying
nanostructures. After being baked at 170 °C for 5 min, the film
was then etched anisotropically using oxygen plasma (50 W, 250 mTorr,
Plasma-Therm Batchtop RIE 95m) down to the intended thickness, using
an etch rate we previously determined (∼2.45 nm/s for both
polymers). We note that the oxygen plasma transforms the Si3N4 coating surface into SiO2 with thickness
expected to depend on the etching details74,75 (e.g., O2 pressure, etching power, and
duration). Subsequently, the second polymer was deposited in the same
way. All of the described steps are illustrated in Figure S14.

Sensitivity Determination
Bulk refractive
index sensitivity
was determined by exposing the metasurface to mixtures of Milli-Q
water (Millipore) and ethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich) at mixing ratios
of 100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, and 20:80 wt %, in a titanium flow
cell (XNano, Insplorion AB), under a constant flow of 100 μL/min,
as regulated by a peristaltic pump (Ismatec). The metasurface sensor
was illuminated using a fiber-coupled halogen lamp (AvaLight-Hal,
Avantes), whereas the extinction spectra were continuously recorded
by a fiber-coupled fixed grating spectrometer (AvaSpec-HS-TEC, Avantes).
To determine the decay lengths of the sensor, subsequent thin Al2O3 films were grown by atomic layer deposition
(Oxford FlexAl). Intermittently, the film thickness (deposited on
an analogue silicon chip simultaneously) was evaluated by ellipsometry
(J.A. Woollam M2000), and the extinction spectra were recorded using
a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Great care was taken to ensure that
the spectra were always acquired from the same spot of the sample.
The λpeak response was derived by fitting a 20th
order polynomial to the spectra.

Oxygen Exposure and Elevated
Temperature Experiments
The oxidation tests and Tg measurements
were carried out in a quartz tube flow reactor with optical access
(X1, Insplorion AB). For the oxidation test, a total gas flow of 100
mL/min was maintained using Ar as the carrier gas, with heating rate
of 1 °C/min. For Tg measurements,
an Ar flow of 50 mL/min with heating rate of 5 °C/min was used.
Prior to the Tg experiment, the sensors
were annealed at 200 °C for 6 h to achieve a stable shape. This
ensures no convolution of signal from the heat-induced reshaping of
the sensors in the measurements (cf. Figure 2b,c). For both oxidation and Tg experiments, the pressure in the reactor was atmospheric.
The sample inside the flow reactor was illuminated by white light
(AvaLight-Hal, Avantes) through an optical fiber coupled to a collimating
lens. The transmitted light was then collected using a fiber-coupled
fixed-grating spectrometer (AvaSpec-1024, Avantes). The λpeak response was derived by fitting a 20th order polynomial
to the spectra.

FDTD Simulations
To simulate the
optical response,
FDTD simulations were performed using Lumerical FDTD Solutions. A
single 3D sensor nanostructure was placed on a SiO2 substrate
and consisted of four separate parts: a Ag bottom disk, a SiO2 spacer layer, a Ag top disk, and a Si3N4 overlayer (see simulation geometry outlined in Figure 3a,b). To match the spectral
position of the simulated plasmonic resonance to that of the measured
one, we slightly varied the geometrical parameters. The bottom disk
was simulated as a truncated cone with a taper angle of 26° (200
nm bottom diameter and 185 nm top diameter and 20 nm thickness) with
rounded corners (5 nm rounding). The spacer layer was simulated as
a truncated cone extending 90 nm above the top of the bottom disk
with a taper angle of 26°. The top disk was simulated as a truncated
cone with a taper angle of 11° (88 nm bottom diameter and 70
top diameter and 30 nm thickness) with rounded corners (8 nm bottom
and 20 nm top rounding). Finally, the Si3N4 overlayer
was simulated as a 10 nm thick layer following the underlying structure.
To get correct field plots without artifacts, a mesh overlayer of
0.3 nm was used around the Ag disks and a rougher 1 nm mesh for the
rest of the structure. Optical properties of the materials were taken
from the literature with SiO2 set to a RI of 1.46, Si3N4 to a RI of 2.07, the surrounding gas to a RI
of 1, and the dielectric function for Ag was taken from Hagemann et al.(76) Light was introduced
as a linearly polarized plane wave via a total-field/scattered-field
source, and the scattering and absorption spectra were collected in
all directions by integrating the Poynting vector of the field. The
field intensity data were collected by power monitors at the resonance
wavelengths of the two Ag disks.
