The
clinical value of current and future nanomedicines can be improved
by introducing patient selection strategies based on noninvasive sensitive
whole-body imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography
(PET). Thus, a broad method to radiolabel and track preformed nanomedicines
such as liposomal drugs with PET radionuclides will have a wide impact
in nanomedicine. Here, we introduce a simple and efficient PET radiolabeling
method that exploits the metal-chelating properties of certain drugs
(e.g., bisphosphonates such as alendronate and anthracyclines
such as doxorubicin) and widely used ionophores to achieve excellent
radiolabeling yields, purities, and stabilities with 89Zr, 52Mn, and 64Cu, and without the requirement
of modification of the nanomedicine components. In a model of metastatic
breast cancer, we demonstrate that this technique allows quantification
of the biodistribution of a radiolabeled stealth liposomal nanomedicine
containing alendronate that shows high uptake in primary tumors and
metastatic organs. The versatility, efficiency, simplicity, and GMP
compatibility of this method may enable submicrodosing imaging studies
of liposomal nanomedicines containing chelating drugs in humans and
may have clinical impact by facilitating the introduction of image-guided
therapeutic strategies in current and future nanomedicine clinical
studies.

==== Body
Despite the
potential advantages
of nanomedicines to improve drug delivery,1 they have so far only made a modest clinical impact to date with
applications in a limited set of indications and without major improvements
over conventional chemotherapies.2 Their
effect in preventing or diminishing potential toxic side effects of
the encapsulated drug payloads has been more pronounced, due to differential
drug release in target and nontarget sites. For example, Doxil/Caelyx—a
PEGylated (stealth) liposome containing doxorubicin—has shown
equal or slightly superior efficacy to conventional chemotherapy in
AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer,
and multiple myeloma while, importantly, abolishing or greatly attenuating
the often dose-limiting cardiotoxicity of an equivalent amount of
non-encapsulated doxorubicin.3 Hence, most
nanomedicines with clinical approval today are used as second-line
treatments or as part of combination therapies with the major advantage
of lower side effects.

In addition to the difficulties of delivering
drug nanocarriers
to specific tissues in vivo,4,5 a
major factor that contributes to the failure of nanomedicines to show
their full potential in the clinic is patient and disease heterogeneity,6 as recently demonstrated in cancer patients.
Thus, PEGylated liposomes, known to accumulate in solid tumors due
to the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, did not accumulate
in tumors at the same level neither in patients with the same nor
in patients with different cancers.7 This
highlights the clinical need to assess which patient group is most
likely to accumulate high amounts of the nanomedicine of interest
and hence benefit maximally from nanomedicinal treatment and to do
so as early as possible in the treatment regimen. Such a personalized
medicine approach may allow nanomedicines, alone or in combination
with other therapies, to demonstrate their full clinical potential.6,8−10

Of the several clinically available noninvasive
imaging techniques
that would allow such a treatment response prediction tool in the
context of nanomedicines, positron emission tomography (PET) is the
only one that allows quantitative analysis of biodistribution with
exquisite sensitivity (signal/background ratios) and adequate spatial/temporal
resolution at the whole-body level. Radiolabeling of liposomal nanomedicines
with radionuclides detectable by other nuclear imaging techniques
such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or planar
imaging has been successfully used to study their biodistribution
in preclinical and clinical studies.8,9,11 SPECT imaging, however, suffers from lower sensitivity
and temporal/spatial resolution than PET. Radiolabeling of liposomal
drugs with PET isotopes has been explored to a much lesser extent
by using radiolabeled lipids or by introduction of exogenous chelators
in the intraliposomal space/phospholipid bilayer.12−23 Both strategies can be useful in the preclinical setting but represent
a significant translational barrier for clinical imaging, as liposome
modification can lead to changes in biodistribution, regulatory barriers,
and the requirement of customized liposome manufacture. To minimize
this barrier, an ideal radiolabeling method would work on preformed
liposomal nanomedicines (without changes in the manufacture) containing
approved components and using clinical radiolabeling reagents and
methods. In addition, radiochemical purities of >95% (as required
for most radiopharmaceuticals) should be achieved and ideally from
high radiolabeling yield reactions (>95%), hence avoiding the requirement
for purification steps. A move in this direction was recently made
by Abou et al. by exploiting the oxygen-rich nature
of the phospholipid hydrophilic heads and the oxophilicity of 89Zr but suffering from modest stability in biological media.24 Moreover, high specific activities (i.e., radioactivity per amount of nanomedicine) should be
achieved, allowing the radiolabeling of subtherapeutic amounts of
nanomedicine and hence microdosing PET studies (defined as 1% of the
therapeutic dose).

We noticed that many drugs of clinical interest
in nanomedicine
have metal-binding motifs (Figure 1A and Figure S1). Hence,
we hypothesized that preformed liposomal nanomedicines containing
such drugs could be efficiently radiolabeled with metallic PET isotopes
such as 89Zr (t1/2 = 78.4 h), 52Mn (t1/2 = 134.2 h), and 64Cu (t1/2 = 12.7 h), by using
well-established metal ionophores (Figure 1B,C). Furthermore, the high concentration
of metal-binding drug molecules inside the liposome and the protective
effect of the phospholipid bilayer from plasma protein transchelation
should result in high radiolabeling yields, specific activities, and
stabilities compared to previously reported methods. This strategy
would allow the simple radiolabeling and PET imaging of many current
and future liposomal nanomedicines and facilitate the introduction
of treatment response prediction tools based on PET in the clinical
setting. Here, we demonstrate and discuss the feasibility and effectiveness
of this method, as well as its advantages and limitations, and show
its utility for detecting and quantifying the biodistribution of a
liposomal nanomedicine containing an aminobisphosphonate in
vivo.

Results
Liposomal Drug PET Radiolabeling
Method Development
Radiolabeling development was performed
using radiometal–ionophore
complexes and a PEGylated liposome loaded with an aminobisphosphonate,
alendronate (ALD, Figure 1A). This liposomal formulation is referred to as PLA. An aminobisphosphonate
was selected as the radionuclide-binding drug of choice to develop
this method for two reasons: (i) known ability to
act as metal chelators to form inert coordination complexes with zirconium,25 copper,26 and manganese;26 and (ii) demonstrated anticancer
activity and γ–δ T-cell immunotherapy sensitizing
properties.27−29 An ionophore was required to transport the radionuclide
through the PEGylated lipid bilayer. We selected hydroxyquinoline
(8HQ) and 2-hydroxyquinoline (2HQ) for their known properties to transport
metal ions across lipid bilayers.14,30,31 The effects of temperature and incubation times were
studied. Excellent radiolabeling yields (RLYs) and purities of >95%
were obtained with 89Zr(8HQ)4, 52Mn(8HQ)2, and 64Cu(2HQ)2 (Figure 1B), after being incubated
with PLA in PBS at 50 °C with shaking for 30 min (Figure 1C). These reaction conditions
did not change the physicochemical properties of the liposomes, as
assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and ζ-potential measurements,
pre- and post-incubation (Table S1). Lower
temperatures and incubation times resulted in lower RLYs.

Radiolabeling
Depends on the Presence and Concentration of the
Encapsulated Drug, Its Counterion, and the Radionuclide Used
To probe the versatility of this radiolabeling method, we tested
it with three positron-emitting metals (89Zr, 52Mn, and 64Cu) and five different PEGylated liposomes.
These liposomes had identical/near-identical physicochemical properties
(phospholipid composition, hydrodynamic size, and ζ-potential)
but contained different drugs/combination of drugs (ALD (PLA); ALD
+ doxorubicin (PLAD; 4 μmol/mL ALD/3 μmol/mL doxorubicin);
sodium salt of ALD (PLA-Na); doxorubicin (Doxil), or empty (PLACEBO)).
The involvement of the encapsulated drug in the radiolabeling process
was confirmed by attempting the radiolabeling of PLACEBO liposomes.
Hence, using the above-mentioned optimized conditions, PLACEBO liposomes
were not labeled (RLYs < 5%) with any of the radionuclides explored
in this work (Figure 1C). Drug-loaded liposomes, however, were radiolabeled in a drug-concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 1D and Table S4). RLYs obtained with 89Zr
and 52Mn were very high over a broader drug concentration
range compared to 64Cu, spanning several orders of magnitude.
Remarkably high radiochemical specific activities were achieved, particularly
with 89Zr-PLA (89Zr: 154 ± 75 GBq/μmol
encapsulated drug; 38 ± 17 GBq/μmol lipid; n = 3). The nature of the drug and the presence of a coordinating
counterion such as sodium, where relevant (PLA-Na, where the counterion
is sodium instead of ammonium, present in PLA/PLAD/Doxil) affect RLYs,
further confirming their involvement. To study the effect of the lipid
membrane composition in RLYs, we attempted the radiolabeling of PROMITIL
(PEGylated liposomal mitomycin C prodrug).32 This liposome does not contain encapsulated drug, and in contrast
to the other liposomes used in this study, its lipid bilayer includes
10% of a lipophilic prodrug of mitomycin C. Radiolabeling was compared
with an identical formulation to PROMITIL that had been loaded with
ALD (PROMITIL-ALD; 6.7 μmol/mL ALD). Interestingly, radiolabeling
with 89Zr(8HQ)4 resulted in a RLY of 47.9 ±
4.1%, n = 3 for PROMITIL and 93.5 ± 1.0%, n = 3 for PROMITIL-ALD. The relatively high RLY of PROMITIL
compared to that of PLACEBO liposomes (48% vs <5%)
is likely to be the result of the presence of the lipophilic prodrug
and retention of the highly lipophilic 89Zr(8HQ)4 complex within the bilayer since the labeling was not stable as
confirmed by complete transchelation to serum proteins after incubation
in human serum. In contrast, radiolabeled PROMITIL-ALD showed high in vitro serum stability (vide infra),
further confirming the requirement of the encapsulated drug.

In Vitro Stability of Radiolabeled Liposomal
Nanomedicines in Human Serum
The stability of the radiometal–liposome
complexes in human serum was studied over 72 h (89Zr, 52Mn) or 48 h (64Cu) by incubation at 37 °C
and analyzed using size-exclusion chromatography. Radiolabeled liposomes
were highly stable in vitro under these conditions
(Figure 1E). It should
be noted that since the circulation half-life of nanomedicines that
exploit the EPR effect such as stealth liposomes (e.g., Doxil/Caelyx) in humans is in the 50–80 h range,33 serum stabilities of ≥80% at 72 h at
these conditions are considered as excellent. Collectively, very low
leakage of radioactivity after 72 h of incubation was found for all
radiometals with liposomes containing the strongly metal-chelating
drug ALD (95.0 ± 3.7%, n = 24). The degree of
serum stability with doxorubicin showed a higher dependency on the
radiometal, with stabilities after 72 h of incubation ranging from
79.6 ± 1.2% (n = 3, 89Zr) to 95.2
± 2.7%, (n = 3, 52Mn). Interestingly,
lower in vitro serum stabilities were consistently
observed with liposomal drug–radiometal combinations that do
not achieve high RLYs with micromolar amounts of encapsulated drug
(i.e., 89Zr-Doxil and 52Mn-PLA-Na).
In addition, 89Zr-PROMITIL (radiolabeled at 40% RLY) was
not stable in serum after 48 h incubation (1.0 ± 0.3%, n = 3), whereas 89Zr-PROMITIL-ALD showed excellent
stability (86.9 ± 3.2%, n = 3). The lack of
serum stability for 89Zr-PROMITIL is probably due to nonspecific
weak binding of the radiometal to the liposome due to the absence
of intraliposomal drug/chelator.

Monitoring Liposomal Nanomedicine
Distribution in a Metastatic
Mammary Carcinoma Model
The biodistribution of the radiolabeled
liposomes was monitored using PET imaging with 89Zr-PLA
in a metastatic mammary carcinoma mouse model (3E.Δ.NT) established
in immunocompromised NSG mice. This cancer model is traceable by SPECT
imaging/fluorescence due to a dual-modality reporter gene, the human
sodium iodide symporter (hNIS-tagRFP), that allows sensitive detection
of viable cancer tissues (primary tumor and metastases) using SPECT
imaging with 99mTc-pertechnetate ([99mTcO4]−) and fluorescence (GFP/RFP) during dissection
and histological studies (Figure 2 and Figure S2).34 The imaging protocol was as follows: first,
3E.Δ.NT/NSG mice were injected with 89Zr-PLA (4.6
± 0.4 MBq in 1.2 μmol phospholipid) at t = 0 followed by PET-CT imaging (liposome biodistribution). The same
mice were then injected with [99mTcO4]− (30 MBq) and imaged by SPECT-CT (hNIS-positive cancer cell biodistribution, vide infra). This process (apart from 89Zr-PLA
injection that was only performed at t = 0 h) was
repeated at t = 24 h, 72 h (n =
5), and 168 h (n = 1). In order to confirm that the
presence of 99mTc was not affecting the quality of the
PET study, a series of phantoms were scanned with different amounts
of 99mTc and 99mTc/89Zr combinations,
confirming that the 2 MBq of 99mTc that could potentially
be present in mice 24 h after [99mTcO4]− injection did not affect PET image quality/quantification.
We chose 89Zr-PLA to validate our method in vivo due to the increasing interest in 89Zr for monitoring
long-circulating biomolecules in clinical PET studies,35 coupled with the strong metal-chelating properties
of ALD26 and its properties as an efficient
sensitizer for γ–δ T-cell immunotherapy.29 SPECT-CT imaging revealed the location of the
primary tumor as well as endogenous hNIS-expressing organs such as
the thyroid, salivary glands, stomach, and mammary glands (Figure 2D). We also found
that this tumor model develops spontaneous metastases in lymph nodes
and lungs (Figure 2B–D). CT images revealed a significant increase in tumor volume
during the imaging study (from 0.29 ± 0.09 mL at t = 1 h to 0.75 ± 0.33 mL at t = 72 h (n = 5; P = 0.017)). Accordingly, the hNIS-positive
tumor volume calculated by SPECT increased from 0.19 ± 0.08 mL
at t = 1 h to 0.56 ± 0.08 mL at t = 72 h. Using these volumes, we were able to calculate the percentage
of necrotic tumor tissue over time, by subtracting the hNIS-positive
volume (SPECT) to the total tumor volume (CT), and found no statistically
significant changes or trends during the study with an average of
29 ± 10% (n = 5) necrotic tissue over the 72
h study.

tumor (T) and metastatic left axillary lymph node (LNmet) and lungs (Lumet). Endogenous hNIS-expressing organs
such as thyroid (Th), salivary glands (Sa), and stomach (St) are also
visible.

The PET-CT study (Figure 3A,B and Table S3) was consistent
with the stealth properties of PLA, showing mainly blood pool uptake
at t = 1 h. On the other hand, a control experiment
of free 89Zr-alendronate (89Zr-ALD) resulted
in high kidney/renal excretion and bone uptake 1 h post-administration,
as expected for a small molecule bisphosphonate36 and/or free 89Zr37 (vide infra and Figure S3). The long-circulating nature of 89Zr-PLA is also evident
from the high signal in the heart during the study (from 31.2 ±
7.2%ID/mL at 1 h to 8.32 ± 0.90%ID/mL at 72 h). The calculated
circulation half-life, assuming first-order single-compartment pharmacokinetics,
is 15 h, matching that of similar mouse studies with PEGylated liposomal
bisphosphonates with identical lipid composition38 and other PEGylated liposomes.39

biodistribution of [99mTcO4]− over time with high uptake in endogenous hNIS-expressing organs
and hNIS-expressing tumor cells in the tumor (T) and metastatic organs

uptake of 89Zr over time in the primary tumor (T), spleen

The PET imaging study revealed
that 89Zr-PLA accumulates
in the spleen (22.2 ± 4.0%ID/mL at 72 h), tumor (non-necrotic,
12.0 ± 2.6%ID/mL; whole tumor, 9.2 ± 1.1%ID/mL at 72 h),
uterus (9.5 ± 0.9%ID/mL at 72 h), and bone (femur; 8.4 ±
1.8%ID/mL at 72 h) (Figure 3A,B and Table S2). We also performed
a PET-CT study using 64Cu-PLA in an ovarian cancer model
(SKOV-3/SCID-Beige) over 48 h (Figure S4 and Table S3). This study was performed to test the versatility and capability
of our radiolabeling method to track liposomal nanomedicines in other
tumor models with different radioisotopes. Results revealed a similar
biodistribution profile with long circulation time and high tumor,
liver, and spleen uptake at 48 h but lacking uterus and bone uptake,
which can be explained by the different animal model and isotope (vide infra).

Increasing uptake of 89Zr-PLA
in the tumor over time
is consistent with the EPR effect and the long blood half-life of
these liposomes and is supported by increasing tumor-to-muscle and
tumor-to-heart/blood ratios (Figure 3D). Accumulation of long-circulating liposomes in the
spleen is frequently seen with stealth liposomes and reflected by
its rising uptake values over time. It is important to note, however,
that the values reported for the spleen from the image-based quantification
are an underestimate of the real uptake due to the small size of the
spleen in young NSG mice (13 ± 4 mg; n = 9),
which cannot be segmented accurately by CT due its poor soft tissue
contrast and the substantial partial volume effect of the PET signal
from this organ. Hence, the volume for the spleen used in this calculation
was that of the PET signal which results in a significantly smaller
uptake value compared to that obtained from the ex vivo biodistribution (Table 1 and Table S2).
The uptake in liver followed a different profile to other organs,
with an increase for the first 24 h followed by a decrease. We found
a similar liver time–activity profile in the 64Cu-PLA/SKOV-3
study (Figure S4C and Table S3). This result
fits well with the known role of hepatic Kupffer cells in the fast
uptake and subsequent metabolism of liposomal nanomedicines, which
peaks within the first 24 h.40 Accordingly,
uptake in bone increases over time as a result of the destruction
of 89Zr-PLA in the liver and/or after tissue extravasation
and release of liposomal contents (free 89Zr or 89Zr-ALD) that have high affinity to bone. It should be noted that
we did not observe significant bone accumulation in the 64Cu-PLA/SKOV-3 study (Table S3), supporting
the notion that it is free/nonchelated 89Zr, and not 89Zr-ALD, that binds to bone. However, the affinity of Cu(II)
toward bisphosphonates is much lower than that of Zr(IV), and free
Cu(II) would target liver rather than bone once the 64Cu(II)-ALD
complex dissociates. We therefore cannot firmly identify the species
that are binding to bone in the 89Zr study. Similar bone
uptake values have been found with long-circulating (>24 h) 89Zr-labeled antibodies and liposomes, suggesting that these
bone-targeting
species are nonchelated 89Zr released after liposome disassembly.19,41−43 Highly vascular organs such as the lungs and kidneys
followed the same decreasing trend in signal as the heart/blood, as
expected for long-circulating nanoparticles that are cleared via the reticuloendothelial system (RES). One animal from
the group was further imaged at 168 h to confirm the biodistribution
trend. Thus, a significant increase of 89Zr was observed
from time point 72 to 168 h in viable tumor tissue (from 12.0 ±
2.6 to 16.9%ID/mL) and bone (from 8.4 ± 1.8 to 13.3%ID/mL), as
well as a decrease in the liver (from 18.6 ± 1.2 to 10.4%ID/mL)
and heart/blood (from 8.3 ± 0.9 to 3.9%ID/mL).

Our SPECT-CT/PET-CT imaging strategy
allowed us to co-register
the two modalities and study the localization of 89Zr (PLA)
and 99mTc (hNIS tumor cells) in the tumors (Figure 3E,F and Video S1). Both 89Zr and 99mTc concentrated
in the rim of the tumor with high levels of colocalization, particularly
in the basal area of the tumor in direct contact with the body of
the animal. Co-localization of 99mTc and 89Zr
within the non-necrotic rim was heterogeneous, and 89Zr
(PLA) localization did not always correspond to areas of high 99mTc uptake. We investigated this observation further using
histological studies (vide infra).

Ex
Vivo Tissue Distribution Analysis of Radiolabeled
Liposomal Nanomedicine
Organ biodistribution data were obtained
at the end of the imaging studies (72 h) to support the imaging-based
quantification (n = 4) (Table 1, Figure 3C, and Table S2). The results
are in close agreement; showing high uptake values in spleen (169
± 49%ID/g), liver (12.1 ± 7.6%ID/g), femur (11.1 ±
3.1%ID/g), uterus (9.6 ± 6.7%ID/g), and tumor (8.4 ± 1.6%ID/g).
In addition, there was a significant amount of 89Zr in
blood (7.8 ± 3.3%ID/g) and other vascular organs such as the
lungs (7.3 ± 2.3%ID/g). Surprisingly, the ex vivo uptake value measured in lungs was very similar to that from the
image-based distribution (7.4 ± 0.9%ID/mL). This was unexpected
since the large proportion of air in lungs during in the in
vivo study should, in principle, result in different %ID/g
and %ID/mL values. We believe there are three main factors that could
contribute to this unexpected result. First, metastatic lungs had
a ca. 50% higher mass compared to normal lungs. Second,
there is still a significant amount of circulating 89Zr-PLA
at this time point, which may contribute to different in vitro/vivo amounts present in the lungs. Lastly, the
breathing of mice under general anesthesia is very suppressed, which
may result in an overall low lung volume measured.

Two independent ex vivo biodistribution control experiments were performed
at 72 h post-injection to validate the findings of the tumor study
with 89Zr-PLA. First, a control experiment with 89Zr-ALD in tumor-bearing mice assessed the potential contribution
of the release of intraliposomal complex/nonchelated 89Zr in the biodistribution data of 89Zr-PLA. The results
(n = 2) showed a significantly different biodistribution
profile, consistent with fast-clearing small bisphosphonates and/or
unchelated 89Zr, with main uptake in bone (i.e., femur) (34.8 ± 2.8 vs 11.1 ± 3.1%ID/g; P = 0.0008) and negligible presence in blood compared to 89Zr-PLA (0.33 ± 0.02 vs 7.8 ± 3.3%ID/g; P = 0.0396) at 72 h after injection. Tumor uptake with 89Zr-ALD was surprisingly high (2.0 ± 0.8%ID/g), but in
agreement with recent reports in other murine tumor models using weakly
chelated 89Zr (as an oxalate complex),37 and significantly lower compared to the 89Zr-PLA
study (8.4 ± 1.6%ID/g; P = 0.006). We performed
a second biodistribution control study with 89Zr-PLA in
non-tumor-bearing NSG mice of the same age to investigate uterus uptake
and as a control for the presence of metastasis in the lungs. We found
no significant differences in the %ID/g uptake values of the uterus
in comparison with data from the tumor-bearing mice (Figure 3C and Table 1). This result confirms that uterus uptake
is not related to the tumor-bearing condition. Similarly, the presence
of miliary metastases in the lungs (as detected by in vivo SPECT/ex vivo fluorescence, Figure 2B,D) had no significant effect in the uptake
of 89Zr-PLA in the lungs (7.3 ± 2.3 for tumor mice vs 6.4 ± 0.8%ID/g for nontumor mice; P = 0.6). The calculated uptake in metastastatic lung tissue, however,
is in the range of 9.5 ± 6.9%ID/g (n = 4) to
12.4 ± 4.8%ID/g (n = 3, after removing one outlier),
which is comparable to those from viable primary tumor (12.0 ±
2.6%ID/mL) and metastatic lymph nodes (16.3 ± 7.1%ID/g, vide infra).

Multimodal Imaging Strategy Allows Detection
and Quantification
of Liposomal Nanomedicine Uptake in Metastatic Lymph Nodes
The presence of the multimodal reporter gene in the 3E.Δ.NT
cell line allowed the detection by SPECT and optical imaging of spontaneous
metastases in the left axillary lymph nodes (n =
4) and lungs (n = 4) (Figure 2B,C) in all the animals studied. Three more
lymph nodes in individual mice were identified as metastatic (one
left brachial, one right axillary, and one renal). The biodistribution
studies also revealed that all the hNIS-positive, and hence metastatic
lymph nodes (LNmet), had a significant higher accumulation
of 89Zr-PLA than nonmetastatic lymph nodes (LN) from the
same animals (16.3 ± 7.1 vs 3.8 ± 2.3%ID/g; P = 0.009), or LN from tumor-free mice (16.3 ± 7.1 vs 5.0 ± 3.5%ID/g; P = 0.03) (Figure 4A). Using this information,
a closer inspection of the PET images revealed that 89Zr
was visible in the left axillary LNmet of mice with highest
uptake (Figure 4B).
There was no difference in the uptake of 89Zr-ALD in LNmet and LN (6.9 ± 3.5 vs 5.6 ± 1.5%ID/g; P = 0.6).

mean ± SEM; n = 2).

We studied the mechanism of 89Zr-PLA uptake in
the primary
tumor and LNmet using histology (fluorescence and/or autoradiography).
The autoradiographs of 99mTc distribution in primary tumors
were in accordance with the SPECT imaging results, showing the presence
of a necrotic core and a mostly viable tumor tissue rim containing
the hNIS-expressing cancer cells (Figure 3E,F and Figure S5). The autoradiography with 89Zr was also localized to
the tumor rim. Similar to what we found in the SPECT-PET co-registration
data, colocalization of 99mTc and 89Zr within
the viable tumor areas was heterogeneous and a strong 89Zr signal did not always correspond to areas of high 99mTc uptake. Fluorescence microscopy studies on adjacent tumor sections
using anti-CD31 antibody and the endogenous signal from hNIS-GFP revealed
a high degree of microvascularization in the rim of the tumor and
a distribution that did not completely match that of the hNIS-positive
cells (Figure 3g).
Since these liposomes accumulate in tumor tissue via the EPR effect, this result provides a potential explanation for
the different 89Zr and 99mTc intratumoral distributions.
Similarly, we found a ca. 4-fold higher degree of
microvasculature density (CD31) in LNmet in comparison
to that in LN (Figure 4D, 63 ± 16 vs 16 ± 4 vessels/mm2; mean ± SEM; P = 0.0304; t-test, one-sided, unpaired), strongly supporting increased uptake
of 89Zr-PLA by EPR effect in LNmet.

Discussion
Our results establish that preformed liposomal nanomedicines, including
some currently in clinical use, can be efficiently labeled with PET
radiometals and tracked in vivo by exploiting the
metal affinity and high concentration of the encapsulated drugs. To
date, PET radiolabeling of liposomes has relied on either the introduction
of radiolabeled phospholipids or exogenous chelators in the intraliposomal
space/phospholipid bilayer.12−23 Importantly, our technique allows radiolabeling of preformed liposomal
nanomedicines, without modification of their components and without
affecting their physicochemical properties. In addition, it achieves
high radiolabeling yields, purities, specific activities, and in vitro/vivo stabilities that are at least
equal or significantly improved (e.g., specific activity)
to previous PET radiolabeling methods.12−23

Our method requires the use of hydroxyquinoline ionophores
to transport
the metallic radionuclides through the lipid bilayer into the intraliposomal
space, where the metal exchanges ligand and binds to the encapsulated
drug. The use of ionophores was essential for efficient radiolabeling
and attempts to label liposomes in its absence, as recently reported
for 64Cu,20 did not work in
our hands for any of the radiometals used. 8HQ, however, is extensively
used in radiopharmacies for labeling cells with γ-emitting isotopes
and hence does not represent a significant barrier for clinical translation30 and has been recently been used for labeling
cells with 89Zr.31 2HQ has been
previously used to radiolabel with 64Cu liposomes loaded
with the chelator DOTA,14 while here we
report the use of 8HQ with the PET tracers 89Zr and 52Mn.

We tested the radiolabeling method with three different
PET radiometals
of sufficient radioactive half-life to track long-circulating nanomedicines
and four PEGylated liposomes of known/promising preclinical and clinical
efficacy.29,33 These liposomes contained different combinations
of drugs but have identical phospholipid chemical composition and
physicochemical properties. The presence of a water-phase encapsulated
drug with metal-chelating properties is a requirement for effective
labeling, as proven by the lack of efficient and stable radiolabeling
in its absence, even when the lipid bilayer contains highly lipophilic
components such as the mitomycin C prodrug.

The high intraliposomal
concentration of alendronate or doxorubicin
allows for very efficient RLYs over a remarkably wide range of submicromolar
drug concentrations (i.e., as much as 5 orders of
magnitude with 89Zr) and consequently remarkably high specific
activities in the range of GBq/μmol. This property is key for
facilitating clinical translation since it avoids purification steps
and would allow the injection of submicromolar concentrations of the
therapeutic liposomal nanomedicine (microdosing), hence minimizing
any potentially undesirable chemotherapeutic toxicity effects to patients
from the imaging study. For example, the typical therapeutic dose
of Doxil/Caelyx for a 70 kg individual contains approximately 546 μmol
of phospholipid, and a typical imaging dose for PET imaging a long-circulating
tracer such as an antibody labeled with 89Zr is 75 MBq.44 According to our experiments, such an amount
of 89Zr radioactivity, sufficient for human PET studies,
could be loaded into a Doxil/Caelyx dose of just 0.034 μmol
of phospholipid, which is 6 × 10–3% of the
therapeutic dose and far below the accepted maximum value for microdosing
(i.e., 1% of the therapeutic dose). According to
our results, other combinations that would allow microdose PET clinical
imaging under these conditions (i.e., those that
achieve specific activities ≥14 MBq/μmol phospholipid)
would be 89Zr/52Mn/64Cu-PLA, 89Zr-PLA-Na, 89Zr/52Mn-PLAD, 89Zr-Doxil, and possibly 52Mn-Doxil.

The radiolabeling
yields follow basic metal coordination chemistry
principles as expected for the formation of the PET radiometal–drug
complexes. Thus, RLYs were consistent with Pearson’s hard and
soft acid–base theory. Hence, the bisphosphonate—a highly
anionic and oxygen-rich drug—showed high affinity for the two
hard Lewis acids, Zr(IV) and Mn(II). On the other hand, Cu(II), a
borderline Lewis acid, shows lower affinity for oxygen-based ligands.
Doxorubicin, a nonanionic metal chelator, consequently showed lower
RLYs (89Zr, 52Mn) or no radiolabeling (64Cu) at the concentration ranges tested. The presence of Na+ as intraliposomal counterion for alendronate in PLA-Na blocks
radiolabeling with 64Cu, compared to the same formulation
with NH4+ as counterion (PLA) (Figure 1D). This result could be explained
by the chemical nature of Na+, a coordinating metal ion
and hard Lewis acid with strong affinity for oxygen donors. On the
other hand, NH4+, a nonmetallic cation unable
to form coordination bonds with bisphosphonates, is not able to compete
with the radiometal. We did not observe this effect with 89Zr or 52Mn, most likely due to their higher oxophilicity
and charge (+4 and +2 vs +1), which successfully
compete with the Na+ ion.

Collectively, liposomes
radiolabeled using this method showed excellent
stability in human serum at 37 °C over 48 h (93.8 ± 4.6%; n = 10; 89Zr, 52Mn, and 64Cu) and 72 h (92.8 ± 6.4%; n = 8; 89Zr and 52Mn). These compare favorably to other reported
radiolabeled liposomes and, importantly, match the circulation half-lives
of current long-circulating liposomal nanomedicines in the clinic
(i.e., 15–30 h in rodent; 50–80 h in
humans). The human serum stability results showed metal and drug dependency,
supporting our hypothesis and providing “perfect matched pairs”
to maximize stability (e.g., 89Zr/52Mn and ammonium alendronate; 89Zr and sodium alendronate; 52Mn and doxorubicin). Our studies also suggest that a requirement
to achieve high in vitro serum stabilities with a
given PET radiometal using our method is to achieve radiolabeling
yields of >60% in the presence of ca. 1 μmol
encapsulated liposomal drug.

The in vivo studies
with 89Zr-PLA and 64Cu-PLA in the 3E.Δ.NT
mammary carcinoma and SKOV-3
ovarian cancer models, respectively, showed the expected pharmacokinetics
and biodistribution of stealth liposomes (i.e., long
circulation time, high tumor uptake, and metabolism via the RES), confirming the utility of this radiolabeling technique
to track liposomal nanomedicines in vivo with different
PET isotopes over a long period of time. The high uptake values in
both tumors (6.7 ± 3.2%ID/tumor at 72 h p.i. in 3E.Δ.NT
model and 7.4 ± 0.8%ID/tumor at 48 h p.i. in SKOV-3 model) compare
favorably to the recent median value of 0.7%ID/tumor from a multivariate
analysis on the compiled data on this field reported recently by Wilhelm et al.(45) An unexpected finding
during the 89Zr-PLA studies was a high uptake in the uterus
of NSG mice. The fact that we did not detect such uptake in the 64Cu-PLA study in female SCID-Beige mice leads us to hypothesize
that this result is specific to NSG mice and could be due high levels
of vascularization, blood flow, and permeability in this strain, and
further experiments would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
Nonetheless, it is only by labeling and imaging nanomedicines at the
whole body level that we can identify unexpected areas of uptake such
as this.

The multimodal (PET/SPECT/fluorescence) reporter-gene
strategy
used allowed us to sequentially image the same animals both in PET
(89Zr-PLA) and in SPECT (99mTc-hNIS reporter
gene) at different time points and hence identify the location of
viable cancer cells—including spontaneous metastases—and 89Zr-PLA in tissues. We found consistent colocalization in
the viable tissue areas of primary tumors but also a high degree of
heterogeneity within these areas. Fluorescence histological studies
strongly suggest that this result is related to different levels of
vascularization within the tumor (which do not always colocalize with
areas of high density of viable hNIS-expressing cancer cells) and
to the well-known EPR mechanism of tumor uptake of stealth nanoparticles.

In addition, metastastic tissues (lymph nodes and lung metastases)
also showed a significant high uptake of 89Zr-PLA compared
to controls, possibly driven by a higher level of microvascularization
and EPR effect. To the best of our knowledge, EPR-driven uptake of
liposomal nanomedicines in metastatic lymph nodes has not been observed
before in small animal studies using nuclear imaging. There is, however,
precedent from clinical studies. Thus, using a DTPA-loaded stealth
liposome labeled with the SPECT isotope 111In, Harrington et al. detected metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer
and head and neck patients.7 By using PET-labeled
nanomedicines and technology, such as the one reported here, these
and smaller metastatic lesions in lymph nodes and other organs will
be detected with better sensitivity and spatial resolution.

Our strategy has potential limitations for clinical translation.
The first one, which applies to all radioactivity-based imaging agents
with long circulation times and isotopes with long radiation half-lives,
is patient radiation dose. Based on our animal imaging study with 89Zr-PLA, we have estimated a human mean radiation dose of
0.9 ± 0.2 mSv/MBq. This is a high radiation dose and would limit
the number of times a patient may undergo such an imaging study, but
it is worth mentioning that there may be a significant error associated
with this estimation as a result of scaling the data from mouse to
man, and recent reports from clinical immuno-PET studies with 89Zr-labeled antibodies have calculated radiation doses close
to this value (e.g., up to 0.7 mSv/MBq).44 In addition, it is expected that future improvements
in clinical PET technology may allow the detection of lower amounts
of radioactivity, by as much as 40-fold, and hence 1/40th the radiation
dose to patients.44,46 Another limitation of our method
is the requirement of a drug with chelating properties. However, since
many drugs contain well-established metal chelator motifs and intraliposomal
drug concentrations are very high (10–1 M range),
we believe that a great number of current and future liposomal drugs
(Figure 1A and Figure S1), such as those studied here, will
be amenable for efficient radiolabeling without modification, thus
enabling the development of a powerful theranostic tool.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a simple and efficient method for
radiolabeling preformed liposomal nanomedicines that contain a metal-chelating
drug such as an aminobisphosphonate with metallic PET isotopes. As
expected from the proposed radiometal–drug interaction, the
drugs tested (alendronate and doxorubicin) have different affinities
to the metals explored in this study (89Zr, 52Mn, and 64Cu), and the labeling yields and in
vitro stabilities obtained are in accordance with the expected
metal–ligand affinities from basic coordination chemistry principles.
Radiolabeled liposomes containing a bisphosphonate showed excellent
human serum stabilities (≥95%) with all radiometals tested,
which is consistent with the strong chelating properties of these
molecules. Liposomes that contain a weaker chelator such as doxorubicin
showed a higher affinity and stability with 52Mn. To demonstrate
the feasibility of this method in vivo, we used preclinical
PET-CT to study the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of a bisphosphonate-loaded
PEGylated liposome (PLA) radiolabeled with 89Zr and 64Cu in two different tumor models (breast and ovarian cancer),
showing the expected biodistribution of stealth liposomes and a high
uptake in primary tumors (both models) and lymph node/lung metastases
(breast cancer model only). Recent work by Pérez-Medina et al. have used a PET nanoreporter technology to demonstrate
that PET-radiolabeled nanoparticles can predict the efficacy of nanomedicinal
therapies in animal models.22 Hence, we
foresee that the method described here may provide a powerful developmental
theranostic tool for many current and future liposomal drugs and will
allow the study of their biodistribution prior to treatment for patient
selection. We expect this work may facilitate the inclusion of a pretreatment
(and possibly on-treatment) imaging stage for the improvement of the
clinical value of liposomal drugs that encapsulate metal-chelating
drugs.

Radionuclides
89Zr
No-carrier-added
zirconium-89 (radionuclidic
purity >99.9%) was purchased from PerkinElmer and produced at the
BV Cyclotron, Amsterdam. Solutions were received and stored as H4[89Zr(oxalate)4] in aqueous oxalic acid
(1 M) and were titrated with 0.5 M ammonium acetate until pH 6–7
(measured using pH strips), just before use. Specific activity: ≥150
GBq/μmol versus DFO titration.

52Mn
52Mn was produced at The

modifications to the methods presented by Graves et al.(47) Briefly, natural chromium powder (100–325
mesh 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) was pressed into a silver backing and bombarded
with 90° incident protons at 16 MeV and 20 μA for 3 h on
a GE PETtrace cyclotron. Following irradiation, the irradiated chromium
target was dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid and diluted
into ethanol. 52Mn was concentrated and purified from the
bulk chromium by three sequential column extractions and elutions
from AG1x8 (Biorad) strong anion exchange resin, ultimately providing 52MnCl2 in 2 mL of 0.1 M HCl. This solution was
carefully titrated before use with a 0.5 M ammonium acetate solution
until the pH was 7. Specific activity: 2.6 GBq/μmol versus DOTA titration, cold trace metals present (ng/MBq

64Cu
64Cu was produced at the
PET Imaging Centre, St. Thomas’ Hospital, London, UK, by proton
bombardment of 10–15 mg of 64Ni (99.6% isotopically

College London, UK.

Synthesis of PEGylated Liposomal Alendronate
(PLA)
Liposomes were prepared by the standard method of ethanol
injection
into an aqueous buffer, followed by extrusion through polycarbonate
membrane filters down to 0.05 μm pore size. The lipid components,
HSPC, mPEG-DSPE, and Chol at mol ratios of 55, 40, and 5%, respectively,
were weighed and dissolved in ethanol. The buffer was a solution of
250 mM alendronic acid (ALD) dissolved in H2O and adjusted
to pH 6.0 with 25% ammonium hydroxide at 60 °C to form a salt
of ALD(NH4)2. The resulting liposomes were then
processed by serial size extrusion in a high-pressure extruder device
(Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC) with temperature control at 60
°C through filters with pore sizes from 1 to 0.05 μm. Non-encapsulated
ALD was removed by dialysis against a buffer of 5% dextrose with 15
mM histidine, pH 7.0, followed by passage over a Dowex anion exchange
resin. The liposomes were sterilized by filtration through 0.22 μM
filters and stored in Vacutainer tubes at 4 °C. Phospholipid
(PL) and ALD content were determined after Folch extraction (8:4:3
CHCl3/MeOH/H2O or sample) where the lower lipophilic
phase contains the organic phosphate (PL) and the upper phase contains
the inorganic phosphate (ALD). Samples of each phase were assayed
by the Bartlett method to determine phosphorus. ALD quantification
based on phosphorus content was confirmed at the Nanotechnology Characterization
Laboratory (NCL, Frederick, MD, USA).

Synthesis of PEGylated
Liposomal Alendronate–Doxorubicin
(PLAD)
PLAD was synthesized using a gradient-induced loading
of doxorubicin (Dox): PLA, prepared as described above, was incubated
with a solution of 10 mg/mL of Dox in 5% dextrose at ALD-Dox molar
ratios ranging between 2 and 0.5. The incubation was with gentle shaking
for 60 min at a temperature of 60 °C, followed by ice–water
cooling immediately upon end of incubation. The resulting liposome
suspension was passed through a Dowex cation exchange resin to remove
any non-encapsulated Dox and was sterilized using 0.22 μm filters.
Dox concentration was measured spectrophotometrically by absorbance
at 480 nm after dilution and disruption of the liposomes in acidified
(0.075 N HCl) 10:90 H2O/t-BuOH solution.
The final concentration of Dox in the formulation was adjusted to
2.0 mg/mL by further dilution with the dialysis buffer (5% dextrose/15
mM histidine). Dox quantification was confirmed at the Nanotechnology
Characterization Laboratory (NCL, Frederick, MD, USA).

Synthesis
of PROMITIL
PEGylated liposomal mitomycin
C lipid-based prodrug (PROMITIL) was prepared and characterized as
previously reported49 and provided by Lipomedix
Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

Synthesis of PROMITIL-ALD
PEGylated
liposomal mitomycin
C lipid-based prodrug containing encapsulated ALD (PROMITIL-ALD) was
prepared as PROMITIL49 with the same lipids
but using a HSPC/Chol/PEG-DSPE/MLP 55/30/5/10 molar ratio and using
a 155 mM ALD(NH4)2 buffer solution (pH 6.5)
during liposome formation. The resulting liposomes were then processed
by serial size extrusion in a high-pressure extruder device (Lipex
Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC) with temperature control at 60 °C
through filters with pore sizes from 1 to 0.05 μm. Non-encapsulated
ALD was removed by dialysis against a buffer of 5% dextrose in 15
mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The liposomes were sterilized by filtration through
0.22 μM filters and stored in Vacutainer tubes at 4 °C.
Phospholipid and ALD content were determined after Folch extraction
(8:4:3 CHCl3/MeOH/H2O or sample) where the lower
lipophilic phase contains the organic phosphate (PL) and the upper
phase contains the inorganic phosphate (ALD). Samples of each phase
were assayed by the Bartlett method to determine phosphorus. The batch
used for these studies contained 30.2 μmol/mL PL, 2.2 mg/mL
ALD, and 6.7 mg/mL MLP and showed a mean hydrodynamic size of 111
nm (PDI = 0.088) by DLS.

Synthesis of 89Zr-ALD
H4[89Zr(oxalate)4] in aqueous 1
M oxalic acid (10 μL,
14 MBq) was mixed with 360 μg of ALD in 300 μL of PBS.
The pH of the solution was increased to 7 by addition of 10 μL
of a 1 M Na2CO3 solution and the mixture heated
at 50 °C for 5 min. The formation of the complex was confirmed
by ITLC-SG strips with a 20 mM sodium citrate mobile phase. Using
this system, 89Zr-ALD has a Rf = 0, whereas H4[89Zr(oxalate)4] has a Rf =
0.9.

Radiolabeling of Liposomes
To radiolabel the liposomes
(PLACEBO, PLA, PLA-Na, PLAD, Doxil, PROMITIL, PROMITIL-ALD), an aliquot
of the radiometal–ionophore solution (vide infra) was mixed with a double volume of the liposomes at the desired
concentration in PBS or saline (chelexed) and incubated at 50 °C
for 30 min with constant shaking. Specific details including concentrations
of liposomes and radiometal–ionophore complexes, as well as
radiolabeling yields and maximum specific activities, are shown in Table S4. To calculate the radiolabeling yield
and/or purify the radiolabeled liposomes, the mixture (or an aliquot)
was loaded into a Sephadex-G25 minitrap column (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, UK) using the manufacturer’s protocol and eluted
using PBS in 250 μL fractions. Fractions containing the liposomes
(first 750 μL) and column were measured for radioactivity to
provide the radiolabeling yield. If required, radiolabeled liposomes
can be concentrated using Vivaspin 500 30K MWCO spin filters (GE Healthcare,
UK).

Synthesis of Ionophore–Radiometal Complexes
64Cu(2HQ)2
This complex has been
reported previously14 but was synthesized
by a different route. To make the stock solution of the ionophore
(2HQ), 3 mg was dissolved in 300 μL of absolute EtOH (assisted
by mild heating), and this solution was subsequently mixed with 300
μL of a 0.5 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 5.5. To form the 64Cu-ionophore complex, 60 μL of the 2HQ stock solution
(300 μg of ionophore) was mixed with 200 μL of the buffered 64Cu(OAc)2 solution, and this mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 15 min. Quality control was performed using
a 1-octanol/H2O solvent extraction method and calculating
its partition coefficient. The same measurement was carried out with
unchelated 64Cu as a control. 64Cu(2HQ)2 has a logPoctanol/water = 0.91
± 0.07 (n = 3), whereas for unchelated buffered 64Cu, this value is logPoctanol/water = −0.11 ± 0.12 (n = 3).

89Zr(8HQ)4
89Zr(8HQ)4 was
synthesized and characterized following a previously
published protocol.31

52Mn(8HQ)2
To make the stock
solution of the ionophore, 3 mg was dissolved in 300 μL of absolute
EtOH (assisted by mild heating) and subsequently mixed with 300 μL
of a 0.5 M ammonium acetate solution pH 7. Thirty microliters of this
solution (150 μg of ionophore) was mixed with 200 μL of
the buffered 52Mn solution, and this mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 15 min. The pH of the reaction solution was
tested to confirm it was 7. Quality control was performed using a
1-octanol/H2O solvent extraction method and comparing with
unchelated buffered 52Mn as a control. 52Mn(8HQ)2 has a logPoctanol/water = 0.69
± 0.25 (n = 3) compared to that of unchelated 52Mn (logPoctanol/water = 0.07
± 0.04; n = 3).

In Vitro Stability Studies in Human Serum
Radiolabeled liposomes
were mixed with human serum (10% v/v) and
incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 48 h (64Cu) or 72 h (89Zr, 52Mn). The stability was
tested by injecting 0.5 mL of this mixture into a size-exclusion chromatography
column Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, UK) at a flow rate
of 0.5 mL PBS buffer/min. Using this system, liposomes elute as a
single peak between fractions 8 and 11 mL, and serum proteins elute
as two main peaks between 15 and 25 mL. Small molecules elute at fractions
between 25 and 40 mL. All fractions were γ-counted, and the
column was monitored to confirm the absence of remaining activity.
To measure the percentage of radiolabeled liposomes, the following
formula was used:  

Cell Line Generation and Culture
MTLn3E mammary adenocarcinoma
cells50,51 (a kind gift of Dr. E. Sahai, CRUK London
Research Institute) were rendered more metastatic by overexpression
of a desensitization-defective chemokine receptor CXCR4 mutant (truncation
by the last 34 amino acids of its C-terminus).52,53 This highly metastatic cell line spontaneously spreads from orthotopically
grown (mammary fat pad) primary tumors as recently demonstrated by
whole-body in vivo cancer cell tracking.34 The cells were modified to stably express the
human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) fused to the fluorescent reporter
TagRFP to enable multiscale multimodal in vivo cell
tracking and ex vivo confocal fluorescence microscopy-based
confirmation of the presence in harvested tissues. Briefly, the DNA
of human NIS was amplified from cDNA by PCR and subcloned between
the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pTagRFP-N1 (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia), yielding NIS C-terminally fused to TagRFP (NT). Primer
sequences used for cloning of NIS-TagRFP were 5′-TTTCTCGAGGCCACCATGGAGGCCGTGGAGACCGGGGAACGG-3′
(forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGAGGTTTGTCTCCTGCTGGTCTCG-3′
(reverse). This construct was then subcloned into the retroviral expression
vector pLPCX (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) and confirmed
by sequence analysis. Subsequently, retroviruses were produced by
standard techniques in 293T cells. Retroviruses were then used to
infect MTLn3E.Δ34-CXCR4 (3E.Δ) cells. Stably NT-expressing
cells lines were obtained post-infection by selection with puromycin
(2 μg/mL) and subsequent FACS sorting (3E.Δ.NT).

MTLn3E cells and all derived cell lines were maintained in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2/95% air in αMEM medium (Sigma, Gillingham,
UK) supplemented with 5% FBS (BioSera, Uckfield East, UK), with admixtures
of selection antibiotics (puromycin and/or hygromycin) when necessary.
293T cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified MEM (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% FBS in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95%
air. In addition, all growth media contained 10 mg/mL l-glutamate,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cell lines were
regularly (≤3 month intervals) tested for mycoplasma (LookOut
mycoplasma PCR detection kit, Sigma) and found to be negative throughout
the study.

Flow Cytometry
For flow cytometric
analysis, cells
were harvested by short trypsinization, washed in PBS, and resuspended
in PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% (w/v)
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) using the FL-1 (for GFP fluorescence)
and FL-3 (for TagRFP fluorescence) channels.

Immunoblot Analysis
Briefly, cells were lysed in 1.5-fold
sample buffer (1.5× LDS; 92.5 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 0.75% (w/w)
lithium dodecylsulfate, 3.75% (w/w) glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM
sodium vanadate, 10 nM calyculin A, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1040 μM
AEBSF, 800 nM aprotinin, 40 μM bestain, 14 μM E64 protease
inhibitor, 20 μM leupeptin, 15 μM pepstatin A), and the
protein concentrations of the resulting lysates were determined using
the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, US). Equal
amounts of protein were supplemented with 100 mM DTT and 0.06 mM Serva
Blue G250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), boiled, and subjected to electrophoresis
using SDS-PAGE before being transferred to PVDF Immobilon membranes
(EMD Millipore, Watford, UK). Membranes were blocked with 4% (w/w)
BSA in TBS-T for 30 min, followed by incubation with the indicated
primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed four times with TBS-T,
and incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
for 60 min at room temperature. The signal was detected with the ECL
kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, US) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Fluorescence Microscopy of Cells
Cells were grown on
acid-treated glass coverslips to the desired cell densities and then
fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. Subsequently,
they were permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, blocked with
1% (w/v) BSA, stained for nuclei using Hoechst 33342 (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany), and mounted in Mowiol containing 2.5% (w/v) Dabco as an
antifade. Samples were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti wide-field
fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat 20×/0.5
NA air objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

In Vitro Radiotracer Uptake in NIS-Expressing
Cells
On the day before the experiment, 5 × 105 cells per well were seeded in a 24-well plate. Cells were washed
with HBSS (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+), and 500
μL of HBSS was added to each well. If blocking of NIS function
was desired, 10 μL of a 500 μM NaClO4 solution
was added for 20 min. Subsequently, 0.1 MBq of 99mTcO4– was added to each well and incubated for
a further 30 min. Supernatant of each well was removed, wells were
washed three times with 1 mL of ice-cold HBSS, and then 500 μL
of 1 M NaOH was added to lyse the cells. The supernatant and washings
of each well were pooled. Thirty microliters of each pooled supernatant/washings
and cell lysate was measured with a γ counter. The total activity
in each pooled supernatant and cell lysate was calculated as follows:  

Animal Experiments
All animal experiments were approved
by the UK Home Office and an ethical review panel, and all requirements
dictated by UK legislation and the above committees were met. All
immunocompromised mice were housed within filter-top cages in Scantainer
units in approved facilities and given food and water ad libitum. All mice were anesthesized with isoflurane (3% Vet Tech Solutions
Ltd.) before injection of radiotracers.

3E.Δ.NT/NSG Tumor
Model
Young adult (5–6
weeks old) female NOD scid gamma mice (NSG; genotype:
NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (005557)) were obtained from Charles River (UK) and housed for 2
days before tumor initiation. 3E.Δ.NT cells were trypsinized,
washed with prewarmed HBSS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+), resuspended, counted, and aliquots of 5 × 105 cells
in 50 μL of HBSS were injected s/c into the left mammary fat
pad between nipples four and five. Once palpable, tumor volumes were
measured with calipers using the following formula: V = π/6lwd, where l is length, w is width, and d is depth. Imaging studies
started 21 days after tumor inoculation.

SKOV-3/SCID-Beige Tumor
Model
Young adult (5–6
weeks old) female SCID-Beige mice were obtained from Charles River
(UK) and housed for 2 days before tumor initiation. SKOV3-ffLuc cells
(Caliper) were trypsinized, washed with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+), resuspended, counted, and aliquots of 2 ×
106 cells in 50 μL of PBS were injected s/c into
the left flank. Once palpable, tumor volumes were measured with calipers
using the following formula: V = π/6lwd, where l is length, w is width, and d is depth. Imaging studies started
72 days after tumor inoculation.

In Vivo Imaging and Analysis of Organ Distribution
PET/SPECT Multimodal Study
with 3E.Δ.NT/NSG Model
Mice were anesthetized with
isofluorane (1.5–2%) during all
imaging sessions. 89Zr-PLA (4.6 ± 0.4 MBq in 1.2 μmol
phospholipid; co-injected with empty liposomes to achieve a total
injected lipid dose of 4 μmol, 160 μL) or 89Zr-ALD (4.4 MBq, 100 μL) was injected i.v. at t = 0 h, and imaging was performed after 10 min first by PET/CT (imaging
of radiolabeled liposomal drugs), followed by injection of 100 μL
of a 99mTcO4– solution (30
MBq) in saline (at t = 1 h) and SPECT/CT imaging
(imaging of tumor and metastases). PET/CT imaging was performed for
45 min on a nanoScan in vivo PET/CT preclinical imager
(Mediso Medical Imaging Systems, Budapest, Hungary). SPECT/CT imaging
was performed after 30 min after i.v. injection of 99mTcO4– using a NanoSPECT/CT Silver Upgrade (Mediso,
Hungary) for 30 min with 1 mm collimators. PET-CT and SPECT-CT were
repeated in the same sequence at t = 24, 72 (n = 5), and 168 h (n = 1) for 89Zr-PLA or t = 24, 72 h (n = 2)
for 89Zr-ALD.

PET-CT Study with SKOV-3/SCID-Beige Model
Mice were
anesthetized with isofluorane (1.5–2%) during all imaging sessions. 64Cu-PLA (14.2 MBq in 1.2 μmol phospholipid; co-injected
with empty liposomes to achieve a total injected lipid dose of 4 μmol,
160 μL) was injected i.v. at t = 0 h, and imaging
was performed after 10 min by PET/CT (imaging of radiolabeled liposomal
drugs) for 45 min on a nanoScan in vivo preclinical
imager (Mediso, Hungary). PET-CT was repeated at t = 24, 48 h (n = 3).

All PET/SPECT/CT data
sets were reconstructed using a Monte Carlo based full 3D iterative
algorithm (Tera-Tomo, Mediso Medical Imaging Systems, Budapest, Hungary).
Decay correction to time of injection was applied. CT images were
obtained with 55 kVp tube voltage, 1200 ms exposure time in 360 projections.
All the images were analyzed using VivoQuant software (inviCRO, USA),
which enables the co-registration of PET/SPECT/CT images and the delineation
of regions of interest (ROIs) for quantification of activity (PET/SPECT)
in specific organs. ROIs for different organs were defined in order
to express uptake in each organ as percentage of injected dose per
gram (%ID/mL). Image-based quantification of the SPECT images was
not reliable due to the presence of the high-energy γ emissions
of 89Zr that introduced a high level of noise in the data.

Ex Vivo Biodistribution Studies
Biodistribution
studies were carried out in accordance with British Home Office regulations
governing animal experimentation. The mice from the imaging studies
were used for the biodistribution studies. Mice under anesthesia were
culled by cervical dislocation, and the organs of interest were dissected.
Each sample was weighed and counted with a γ counter (LKB compugamma),
together with standards prepared from a sample of the injected material.
If required, organs were weighted before freezing using OCT (VWR,
Lutterworth, UK). The percent of injected dose per gram of tissue
was calculated for each tissue type. The percent of injected dose
per gram of 89Zr-PLA in metastatic lung tissue was obtained
by calculating the average %ID and mass of nonmetastatic lungs (from
the 89Zr-PLA in non-tumor-bearing NSG mice study) and subtracting
these average values to each value from the 89Zr-PLA study
with tumor-bearing 3E.Δ.NT/NSG mice.

Fluorescence Microscopy
of Tissues
Harvested tissues
were stored at −80 °C until most radioactivity was decayed
and samples were considered safe to handle without radioprotection.
Subsequently, 10 μm thick tissue sections were cut using a cryostat
and mounted on superfrost slides (VWR, Lutterworth, UK). Sections
were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, blocked with
1% (w/v) BSA (30 min), and stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/mL
in PBS, 30 min) and mounted in Mowiol containing 2.5% (v/v) Dabco.
For staining with anti-CD31, cut sections were treated with Fix &
Perm Solution B1000 (ADG, Kaumberg, Austria) and blocked with 1% (w/v)
BSA. Subsequently, samples were stained with the indicated primary
antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature before being
washed and incubated with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary
antibodies in blocking buffer for 45 min in the dark at room temperature.
Samples were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/mL in PBS,
15 min), washed, and mounted in Mowiol containing 2.5% (w/v) Dabco
as an antifade. Images were taken using a TCS SP5 (Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Neofluor 25×/0.5
NA and Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 NA objectives.

Autoradiography
of Tissues
Harvested tissues were cut
into ∼25 μm thick sections using a cryostat and mounted
on superfrost slides (VWR, Lutterworth, UK). Sections were fixed with
4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, washed, mounted in Mowiol,
and exposed to a storage phosphor screen for either 2 min at 3 h post-dissection
to obtain the 99mTc signal or 20 min at 5 days post-dissection
to obtain the 89Zr signal. The storage phosphor screen
was read out using a Typhoon 9200 imager (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham,
UK) and analyzed using manufacturer’s Image Quant software.

Human Absorbed Radiation Dosimetry Estimation
Human
absorbed radiation dose (Medical Internal Raditaion Dose (MIRD) adult
male and female standard models) was estimated using OLINDA/EXM version
1.1 (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA)54 from the animal PET image-based time % injected dose curves
(non-decay-corrected) of the 3E.Δ.NT/NSG study with 89Zr-PLA. Preclinical data in the form of percentage uptake per gram
of tissue were extrapolated to human percentage uptake per organ (standard
MIRD model organ weights), using the method originally proposed by
Kirschner et al.(55) and
subsequently applied by Chang et al.(56) Organ masses used to scale from mouse to man were obtained
from the ex vivo biodistribution experiment. The
% injected dose values were rescaled with tumor uptake (for both models)
and uterus uptake (for male only) excluded from the calculations.

Statistics
Student’s t-tests
were used to calculate P values, and unless otherwise
indicated, Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA/USA) was used. Numbers
in the text indicate means of pooled data ± standard deviation
unless otherwise stated.
