Transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), together with other two-dimensional
(2D) materials, have attracted great interest due to the unique optical
and electrical properties of atomically thin layers. In order to fulfill
their potential, developing large-area growth and understanding the
properties of TMDCs have become crucial. Here, we have used molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow atomically thin MoSe2 on GaAs(111)B.
No intermediate compounds were detected at the interface of as-grown
films. Careful optimization of the growth temperature can result in
the growth of highly aligned films with only two possible crystalline
orientations due to broken inversion symmetry. As-grown films can
be transferred onto insulating substrates, allowing their optical
and electrical properties to be probed. By using polymer electrolyte
gating, we have achieved ambipolar transport in MBE-grown MoSe2. The temperature-dependent transport characteristics can
be explained by the 2D variable-range hopping (2D-VRH) model, indicating
that the transport is strongly limited by the disorder in the film.

==== Body
Atomically
thin two-dimensional
(2D) materials have shown great potential because of their interesting
electrical and optical properties.1−4 Potential applications in flexible electronics
and the possibility to further extend their range of applications
by integrating them into heterostructures5 motivate scientists to develop a reliable way to grow large-area
2D materials.6−9 Whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can on one hand result in
high-quality 2D materials and 2D heterostructures with sharp and clean
interfaces,10 the toxicity of some of the
precursors introduces challenges, and the lack of in situ characterization and monitoring during growth can lead to nonreproducible
results. On the other hand, using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to
grow atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and
other 2D materials via van der Waals epitaxy11−16 has several potential advantages. The deposition can be well controlled
using high-purity elemental sources; direct heterostructure growth
can be achieved, and the growth in an ultrahigh vacuum environment
limits the amount of impurity atoms. In addition, the quality of the
MBE-grown film can be monitored during growth in situ using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). The growth
of different TMDCs on various substrates has been recently demonstrated,17−19 and the band structures and thin film morphology have been intensively
investigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning
tunneling microscopy.20−22 However, reports on the electrical properties of
atomically thin layers grown by MBE23 are
rare and indicate that the material quality needs to be improved further.
Starting from this point, it is crucial to optimize epitaxial growth
and to investigate the optical and electrical properties of MBE-grown
atomically thin TMDCs.

Results
Here, we report on the use
of MBE to grow atomically thin MoSe2 on GaAs(111)B down
to nominal monolayer (ML) thickness, exhibiting
high optical quality confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and Raman
spectroscopy. We find that using GaAs(111)B as the growth substrate
results in a high degree of control over lattice orientation of the
domains forming the polycrystalline film. The features of van der
Waals epitaxy were thoroughly investigated by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Using scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM), we have observed that depending on the growth temperature,
polycrystalline MoSe2 films can be composed of grains with
either a 15° or a 60° misorientation angle. Both configurations
are predicted to be energetically stable by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. We further address the electrical properties of
highly oriented nominal ML MoSe2 and demonstrate ambipolar
transport behavior using polymer electrolyte gating. Temperature-dependent
measurements indicate that the transport is limited by the disorder
and can be explained using the 2D variable-range hopping (2D-VRH)
model.

Atomically thin MoSe2 films were grown on
GaAs(111)B
substrates by MBE, and the growth was monitored in situ using a RHEED camera. Atomic hydrogen was used to effectively remove
native oxide at low temperature without As desorption,24,25 and a clean GaAs(111)B surface with sharp RHEED streaks along the
GaAs[11–2] azimuth was observed (see Figure 1a). As the growth progresses, GaAs-related
streaks gradually fade out and are replaced by a new set of faint
streaks with a smaller spacing, indicating the formation of MoSe2. A RHEED pattern from the MoSe2 film with a half-layer
coverage is shown on Figure 1b, with GaAs and MoSe2 streaks having similar intensities.
GaAs-related streaks completely vanish as a full film is grown, while
MoSe2 streaks become more intense Figure 1c. The sharp streaks in Figure 1c,d indicate the epitaxy with
MoSe2[10–10]//GaAs[11–2] and MoSe2[11–20]//GaAs[10–1], respectively. The van der Waals
epitaxy thus provides a reliable way for developing large-scale 2D
materials on different substrates.19,26

of the transferred film. The sample was grown at 470 °C.

Films grown on GaAs(111)B were
examined ex situ using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Figure 1e shows
the core-level spectrum of the Mo
3d range. The binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks are 229.2 and 232.4 eV, respectively. An additional
AsLMM peak with a lower binding energy of 227.2 eV is also
observed. The Se 3d core-level spectrum in Figure 1f shows an Se 3d5/2 peak at 54.9
eV and an Se 3d3/2 peak at 55.8 eV, demonstrating the existence
of Mo–Se bonds. A consistent binding energy shift is observed
in the core-level spectra of Ga 3d and As 3d between pristine GaAs
substrate and as-grown MoSe2, implying that charge transfer
takes place at the interface (see Supplementary Section 1 for more details). On the other hand, the peak positions
and the high quality of fitting show that no intermediate compounds
exist at the interface, as expected from van der Waals epitaxy.

The Raman spectrum of nominal ML MoSe2/GaAs(111) shown
on Figure 1g clearly
shows the MoSe2 A1g mode at 238.7 cm–1, which is comparable with that of exfoliated ML MoSe2 on 270 nm SiO2. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was also
used to investigate the optical properties of ML MoSe2.
In order to avoid the optical quenching effect from the substrate,18,27 the as-grown film was transferred onto a 270 nm SiO2/Si
chip, with the optical image shown in the inset of Figure 1h and Figure S2. The 1.58 eV peak recorded at room temperature is clearly
shown in Figure 1h
and is comparable with the exfoliated ML flake in terms of the peak
positon. Despite inevitable existence of wrinkles and folded regions
due to the imperfect transfer process which might introduce defects
and peak broadening, the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 37 meV
is comparable to that of exfoliated ML flakes (fwhm = 27 meV).

The films were transferred onto the TEM grids and investigated
using Cs-corrected STEM in order to examine their morphology. Figure 2a shows a low-magnification
high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM image of MoSe2 grown at the temperature of 470 °C. The patch-like islands
with a typical size of a few nm with different brightness represent
regions with varying thicknesses. Surprisingly, the corresponding
fast Fourier transform (FFT) image calculated from this image and
shown in the inset of Figure 2a shows only two sets of spots with a six-fold symmetry, rotated
by ∼15° with respect to each other. The high-magnification
HAADF-STEM image in Figure 2b shows corresponding domains with a relative rotation of
15°, labeled ML(A) and ML(B). These are sometimes also stacked
on top of each other, forming bilayers (BLs). A more detailed analysis
of the grain orientation is presented on Figure S3 and shows that both orientations appear with roughly the
same frequency in the ML film. Most of the BL area (∼70%) is,
however, of the ML(A) + ML(B) type, composed of two MoSe2 layers with an interlayer twist of 15° and could present an
interesting material system for studying the effect of interlayer
twist on electrical and optical properties of 2D semiconductors.28

We have gained further insight into the stability of both
types
of MoSe2/GaAs(111)B superlattices by considering several
models and determining their formation energies through DFT calculations
(see Supplementary Section 3). The picture
that emerges suggests that a twisting angle not only dramatically
reduces the strain in the MoSe2 lattice but also leads
to a slightly more favorable interaction with the GaAs(111)B substrate,
irrespectively of the relative MoSe2–GaAs orientation.
Overall, formation energies of oriented and misoriented MoSe2/GaAs(111)B superlattices are very similar, indicating that both
cases are likely to form. Nevertheless, it is also worth mentioning
that the growth dynamics should also play a role in the migration
of adatoms prior to in-plane bond formation, which could influence
the growth, resulting in large regions with single orientation. Possible
changes in the surface reconstruction at these temperatures close
to GaAs decomposition are not taken into account either, which could
explain the difference in the morphology of films grown at these two
temperatures.

A slight increase of growth temperature, into
the 500–530
°C range, results in increased order in the film, with the grains
no longer showing the 15° misorientation. The HAADF-STEM image
of the film is shown on Figure 2c. The corresponding FFT image now shows only one set of peaks.
Since ML MoSe2 does not possess inversion symmetry, we
cannot exclude the presence of grains with a 60° relative orientation
at this point as these would result in a set of diffraction peaks
at the same positions in Fourier space. The presence of voids in the
film indicates that BLs start to form before the first MLs complete.
Similar morphologies of MBE-grown MoSe2 on highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite, graphene, and SiC(0001) were also observed by
STM by other groups.18,21,27,29,30

Because
the intensities recorded in HAADF-STEM images are related
to Rutherford scattering, which increases with the atomic number (Z),31,32 different intensities in the
image can be attributed to different layer thickness. Figure 2b shows the intensity histogram
with dashed lines that correspond to intensities in ML and BL regions.
The intensity profile along the slice of interest is plotted in Figure 2c, showing the thickness
varying from ML to BL. Figure 2d shows a high-magnification image of a ML region with the
intensity profile along a slice of interest shown in Figure 2f, where the positions of Mo
and Se atoms can be assigned to periodically varying intensities.
The ML has a 2H structure with a lattice constant estimated to be
3.29 ± 0.03 nm, which is in line with the bulk lattice constants
reported in literature.33,34

To further confirm
the long-range uniformity of the MoSe2 film, we have measured
second harmonic generation (SHG) from as-grown
MoSe2/GaAs(111)B and suspended MoSe2 on TEM
grids (Figure S7). Polar plots of SHG intensity
show six-fold symmetry, whereas the PL intensity and Raman A1g peak position and intensity maps indicate a high degree of uniformity
(see Supplementary Section 4).

We
now focus on the electrical properties of 0 and 60° MoSe2 with nominal ML thickness. We use electric double-layer transistors
(EDLT) in order to access a wide range of electrostatically induced
doping levels and to reduce Schottky barrier heights at contacts,
allowing efficient electron and hole injection using the same contact
material.35Figure 3 shows the schematic of the device. The polymer
electrolyte PS–PMMA-PS:[EMIM]-[TFSI] is spin-coated on top.
It allows us to reach high carrier densities and increases the efficiency
of carrier injection, making it ideal for achieving ambipolar regime
of operation.35,36 We also include a back gate,
allowing charge carrier modulation in the semiconducting film at temperatures
below the freezing point of the polymer electrolyte (T ∼ 200 K). Devices without a polymer electrolyte show a very
poor transistor behavior (see Supplementary Section 5). The dependence of the EDLT on the polymer electrolyte voltage VPE exhibits a clear ambipolar behavior close
to room temperature (T = 280 K) (Figure 3b). We find a current Ion/Ioff ratio of
∼104 and ∼102 for the n and p
sides, respectively. The maximum current density on the n side, with
the value of ∼1 μA/μm, is 2 orders of magnitude
larger than that on the p side, possibly due to intervalley scattering
of electrons, while the off current remains at pA levels. The subthreshold
swing calculated from the linear region is ∼390 mV/dec for
both sides. Field-effect mobilities can be extracted from four-contact
devices by freezing the polymer electrolyte at 200 K and performing
a back-gate sweep (see Supplementary Section 6), which allows the charge carrier concentration in the 2D semiconductor
to be modulated around the value set by VPE prior to freezing the electrolyte. The extracted electron mobility
μe is ∼0.05 cm2 V–1 s–1, and hole mobility μh is
∼0.28 cm2 V–1 s–1. The mobility values are significantly lower than those of CVD-grown
MoSe2.37,38 These results indicate that charge
carrier transport is strongly influenced by the disorder in the film.23,39

Figure 3 Ambipolar
transport in MoSe2 EDLT. (a) Schematic of
the MoSe2 EDLT in a dual-gate geometry. The back gate is
used to modulate the charge density in the 2D channel around the value
set by the reference electrode with the applied voltage VPE. (b) Channel current as a function of VPE showing ambipolar behavior.

In order to elucidate the dominant transport mechanism in
MBE-grown
atomically thin MoSe2, we have performed electrical measurements
as a function of temperature, polymer electrolyte, and back-gate voltage. Figure 4a shows the sheet
conductivity Gsh as a function of VPE based on the four-contact device shown in
the inset. The VPE applied for the p side
needs to be pushed to VPE < −4
V to reach the same value as on Gsh of
the n side, indicating strong electron doping or Fermi level pinning
to the conduction band. A drop in Gsh takes
place at VPE > 3 V and can be attributed
to the electrolyte-induced disorder which is commonly observed in
experiments involving EDLTs.40,41 The sweep at 280 K
can then provide a reference curve for different doping levels that
can be achieved by changing VPE. Once
the doping level at a given VPE is stabilized
at 280 K, we freeze the electrolyte down to 200 K with a cool-down
rate of 1 K/min. The VPE is then disconnected
at 200 K after the electrolyte was completely frozen so that Gsh can be stabilized (see Supplementary Section 7). The Gsh during each cool down was recorded down to 12 K with a cooling rate
of 0.5 °C/min. The process was reversible after a mild annealing
by ramping the temperature to 333 K.

(a) Sheet conductivity Gsh as a function
of VPE at 280 K. Inset: Optical image
of the four-contact device. (b,c) Gsh as
a function of T–1/3 on the hole
and electron sides for different values of VPE filled lines corresponds to fits to the VRH model. (d) Evolution
of the localization length ξloc with VPE, extracted from fits to the VRH model on the hole branch.
(e) Dependence of ξloc on VPE for the electron branch.

The Gsh of MoSe2 at
a given VPE monotonically decreases with
decreasing temperature,
showing semiconducting behavior for both sides. The dependence above
80 K follows the 2D-VRH model42 with the
relation Gsh ∝ exp[−(T0/T)1/3], where T0 is the characteristic temperature. A linear
fit of ln Gsh to T–1/3 is plotted at each given VPE, demonstrating the validity of the 2D-VRH mechanism for
both sides (Figure 4b,c). The VRH mechanism is usually observed in disorded systems,23,40 and the results imply that the transport of MoSe2 EDLT
is strongly influenced by the voids and the nanometer-scale grains
in the film.

Charge carriers are strongly scattered and tend
to hop between
different conductive paths. The localization length can be changed
in a small range by changing VPE, that
is, changing the doping level. The dependency is evident by extracting T0 from the fits to the 2D-VRH model with the
value of slopes s extracted from Figure 4b,c, where T0= s3. The values of T0 decrease by more than 1 order of magnitude
with the increase of |VPE| because of
the increase of carrier densities in the material, thus screening
the disorder along the conductive paths. The localization length ξloc can be extracted using the expression , where kB is
the Boltzmann constant and D the density of states
(see Supplementary Section 8). The results
are plotted in Figure 4d,e for p and n sides, respectively. Holes have a slightly lower
ξloc, with ξloc reaching a maximum
value of ∼4 nm at VPE = −4.2
V. The n side, on the other hand, shows tunable ξloc up to ∼9 nm with VPE = 2.45 V.
All values of ξloc have the same order of magnitude
as the grain size shown in STEM images, indicating that the 2D-VRH
transport is linked to the disorder in the as-grown MoSe2. Future MBE-based growth efforts will have to concentrate on increasing
the grain size in order to improve the film quality.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have grown atomically thin MoSe2 using
MBE. Films show a high degree of alignment due to the van der Waals
interaction with the GaAs substrate and can be transferred to insulating
substrates for further optical and electrical transport studies. We
realize electrolytically gated transistors based on transferred ML
MoSe2 films. Electrical transport follows the 2D-VRH model
due to disorder in the film, with localization length comparable to
the grain size.

Methods
MBE Setup and
Material Growth
The growth was carried
out in an Omicron MBE (Lab 10) with a ∼10–10 mbar base pressure. Cleaved 1 × 1 cm2 GaAs(111)B
substrates were outgassed at up to 500 °C for at least 30 min.
The native oxide was removed from the surface of GaAs(111)B by heating
it to 350 °C under a flux of atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen molecules
were dissociated by a tungsten filament with Joule heating at 70 W
and were introduced into the chamber via a leak valve.
The procedure lasted 30 min or more at base pressure of ∼3
× 10–7 mbar, resulting in sharp streaks in
RHEED. A Kundsen cell and an electron beam source (EFM-3 from Omicron)
were used for Se and Mo evaporation, respectively. The flux rates
were calibrated using a quartz crystal microbalance, and the flux
ratio of Se/Mo was optimized to be ∼40 for growth. A RHEED
camera (Staib Co.) was used to monitor the growth in situ. The growth temperature was optimized in the 470–530 °C
temperature range. Post-annealing at up to 550 °C was performed
in Se atmosphere. Higher temperature leads to GaAs decomposition and
increased surface roughness.

XPS and Raman Spectroscopy
The XPS
spectra were obtained ex situ in a commercial KRATOS
AXIS ULTRA system, and a
C 1s core-level peak at 284.8 eV was used for the reference. Peak
identification and fitting were performed in PHI MultiPak processing
software. Raman analysis was performed using a Horiba LabRAM HR800
system using a 532 nm wavelength green laser with spot size ∼4
μm. The laser power was kept below 4 mW during all measurements.
We used an 1800 lines/mm grating and have calibrated the system using
the polycrystalline Si peak at 520 cm–1. The PL
was measured in a home-built setup using a 488 nm laser (Coherent)
for excitation.

STEM Microscopy and Analysis
The
STEM experiments were
performed on a FEI Titan Themis 300 double Cs-corrected microscope
at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV in order to minimize beam damage.
The scanning probe had a 28 mrad semiconvergence angle, resulting
in a resolution close to 1 Å. The data were acquired under annular
dark-field conditions using an annular detector with a collection
half-angle between 40 and 200 mrad.

Material Transfer and Device
Fabrication
As-grown films
were coated with PMMA and immersed into 30% KOH(aq) at
90 °C. The detached PMMA layer with the as-grown film was then
transferred to a beaker with deionized water several times to remove
excess KOH(aq) and was transferred onto a degenerately
doped n++ Si chip covered by 270 nm SiO2 or
TEM grids. PMMA was removed in acetone. Palladium was used for electrical
contacts in a standard PMMA-based e-beam lithography process. A second
e-beam lithography was performed, followed by O2/SF6 plasma etching in order to define the device geometry. To
fabricate an EDLT, the PS–PMMA-PS:[EMIM]-[TFSI] electrolyte
was spin-coated onto the device and soft-baked at 60 °C for 10
min. A more detailed description is available elsewhere.43,44 Electrical measurements were carried out using an Agilent 5270B
SMU and Keithley 2000 DMM. Cryogenic measurements were performed in
a Janis closed-cycle cryogen-free cryostat.
