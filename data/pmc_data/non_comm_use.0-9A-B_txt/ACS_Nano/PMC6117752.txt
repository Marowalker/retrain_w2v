Cells
rely on versatile diffusion dynamics in their plasma membrane.
Quantification of this often heterogeneous diffusion is essential
to the understanding of cell regulation and function. Yet such measurements
remain a major challenge in cell biology, usually due to low sampling
throughput, a necessity for dedicated equipment, sophisticated fluorescent
label strategies, and limited sensitivity. Here, we introduce a robust,
broadly applicable statistical analysis pipeline for large scanning
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data sets, which uncovers the
nanoscale heterogeneity of the plasma membrane in living cells by
differentiating free from hindered diffusion modes of fluorescent
lipid and protein analogues.

Quantification of molecule diffusion
dynamics in the plasma membrane of living cells is essential
for the understanding of their function.1−3 Most fluorescence-based
methodologies for examining the heterogeneity of lipid and protein
diffusion dynamics, such as single-particle tracking,4,5 fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,6,7 or
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)1,2 and
their advancements, especially super-resolution stimulated emission
depletion (STED) FCS,8−10 either necessitate specialized hardware, sophisticated
fluorescence labeling, or constrain themselves to quantification with
limited spatial and temporal sensitivity. Together, these issues remain
to pose practical challenges for the quantification of diffusion dynamics
in living cells.

Important advancements in fluorescence acquisition
and/or analysis
pipelines drew attention to the power of simple measurement equipment
like total internal reflection setups, which can be used for camera-based
FCS variants.11−13 For instance, for the disclosure of large spatial
diffusion maps, the methodology of image mean square displacement
(iMSD) analysis provides robust detection of free Brownian and non-Brownian
hindered diffusion modes.14,15 Unfortunately, these
camera-based acquisitions often limit the accessible diffusion time
scales.16

Yet, scanning FCS (sFCS)
measurements acquired with confocal laser scanning
microscopes offer a good compromise in terms of equipment, adaptability
(e.g., combination with iMSD), and high spatiotemporal
sensitivity with statistical accuracy and flexibility by combining
conventional instrumentation and standard fluorescence labeling.14,17−19 Specifically, the large number of simultaneously
acquired FCS curves (>50 curves) and well-established fitting and
bleaching correction procedures ensure high confidence in the data
analysis.20−22 Although sFCS measurements are often performed in
biological membranes at the equatorial plane of cells or vesicles,23,24 they can, in principle, flexibly be applied anywhere in the cell
volume.19,22,25 From the biological
point of view, it is important to differentiate three main parameters
for the complete characterization of molecular diffusion dynamics:
the total number of diffusion processes, the fraction of molecules
contributing to each diffusion mode, and their respective diffusion
time scales. Such a parametrization allows one to infer whether molecules
undergo free Brownian or hindered diffusion, revealing deeper insights
into cellular signaling and function. For example, during the activation
of immune cells, well-defined fractions of immune receptors are thought
to form receptor clusters through transient trapping of their intracellular
domains.29,30 In turn, certain lipids such as 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and the transferrin
receptor have been shown to undergo hindered hop diffusion within
the dense cortical actin network beneath the cell membrane.4,25−27 Conventional sFCS recordings theoretically contain
all the kinetic information on such hindered diffusion of fluorescent
particles, including hop and trapped diffusion modes within the observed
probe ensemble. However, this information is mostly lost due to averaging
during the analysis process because, traditionally, only the average
diffusion coefficients and their standard errors are computed, assuming
a normal distribution of the sFCS data sets. Consequently, conventional
sFCS quantification analysis does not usually allow for the direct
disclosure of diffusion modes, such as for differentiating hindered
from free Brownian diffusion, precluding perhaps the discovery of
lipid or protein clustering, hopping, or trapping.

Here, we
introduce a pipeline for the statistical analysis of sFCS
data recorded by confocal microscopy, yielding the systematic and
robust quantification of diffusion modes in living cells. The protocol
allows a systematic mathematical characterization of the distribution
of sFCS diffusion data, involving fitting analysis and the calculation
of the biological-relevant parameters, and a quantitative evaluation
of the results using weighted fitting residuals and maximum likelihood
estimations. Applying this framework to the free and non-Brownian
diffusion dynamics of lipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored proteins demonstrates the power of the method and allows
a comprehensive characterization of well-known molecular particle
diffusion in computer-simulated data sets, supported lipid bilayers
(SLBs), and the plasma membrane of living cells. Combining this analysis
pipeline with conventional confocal sFCS experiments may offer alternative
avenues for systematic studies of the mechanisms by which living cells
adjust their molecular membrane dynamics to their physiological needs.

Analysis of sFCS experiments conventionally involves two steps:
(i) simultaneous acquisition of a multitude of FCS curves acquired
by repeatedly scanning few-micrometer-long lines, and (ii) obtaining
the transit times of the diffusing molecules through the observation
spot from fitting the respective time-correlated data for each pixel
of the line to specific diffusion models, yielding a value of an average
transit time and a standard error. To improve sFCS analysis, we aimed
to examine the full kinetic information provided by all the correlation
curves. Consequently, our strategy comprised a third step, wherein
we computed and analyzed the transit time histograms to extract further
information on the diffusion modes (Figure 1a), exploiting the statistical power of large
ensemble measurements independent of local spatial heterogeneities.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
of the experiment principle. (Left) sFCS data are
recorded by scanning the laser (green dots) along a micrometer line
in the membrane (lipids with red headgroups and gray tails), thereby
creating (through temporal correlations) FCS data (decaying curves G(τ) from red to blue against correlation time τ)
for each pixel along the line (space). (Right) All FCS data are fitted
to obtain values of transit times through the observation spot, in
which histograms (blue, probability distributions; right, cumulative;

Results and Discussion
We first
set out to statistically evaluate the distribution of
transit time values obtained from a large ensemble of computer-simulated
sFCS data (see the Methods section and the Supporting Information). Consistent with previous
findings, the histograms over a wide range of transit time values
displayed non-Gaussian distributions (Supporting Information Figure S1a). The broadness and asymmetry toward
longer transit times of the distribution depended on the magnitude
of the measured transit time values, because the error of the measurements
increased exponentially with the transit times, accompanied by respective
changes in the signal-to-noise and fitting standard deviation (Supporting Information Figure S1b,c). Specifically,
slow diffusing particles experienced larger errors than faster particles,
primarily depending on the finite scanning frequency but also on other
factors such as the finite acquisition time. To this end, the total
acquisition time determined the number of points for correlation,
limiting the convergence of the corresponding FCS curves.20 Computing the logarithm of the corresponding
transit time histograms revealed a normal distribution, indicating,
together with exponentially distributed signal-to-noise and fitting
standard deviation, that sFCS data were log-normally distributed (Figure 1a and Supporting Information Figure S1b,c). The variance
of the distributions increased with increasing transit time (Supporting Information Figure S1a).

In
the following, we exploited the mathematical properties of a
log-normal distribution, hereafter referred to as LogNorm. Statistical
analysis of the sFCS data was achieved by fitting the cumulative,
logarithmic, and linear representation of the histograms using analytical
forms of the LogNorm (Figure 1a and Supporting Information Figure S2a). LogNorm functions are well-defined through their two characteristic
parameters, μ and σ, which can mathematically be related
to the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution in its
logarithmic representation. Consequently, the analysis involves the
fitting of three representations to obtain two free parameters. Large
ensemble acquisitions of sFCS curves (>400 per condition) ensured
sufficient bin counts (30–80 bins). The bins of a given transit
time histogram reflected the number of fitting points. Empirically,
we found that the LogNorm fitting accurately recovered the input diffusion
parameters in the computer simulations of free diffusion over a wide
range of transit times (inset of Figure 1b and Supporting Information Figure S2b–d).

Next, we introduced hindered trapped
diffusion (transient halts
in the diffusion path; see stochastic trapping model in the Methods section and Supporting Information Figure S3a,b) as a second process in addition to
free diffusion in the computer simulations. Using our statistical
analysis, we found deviations from the single-LogNorm behavior as
indicated by the weighted residuals. These transit time histograms
were accurately fitted with a double-LogNorm fitting model in all
three representations (Figure 1c and Supporting Information Figure S3c). Consistently, the statistical analysis indeed revealed two LogNorm
transit time histograms reporting on free Brownian and non-Brownian
trapped diffusion.

To confirm the findings of the computer simulations,
we further
measured the diffusion of fluorescently labeled lipids in SLBs. As
expected, analysis of the diffusion dynamics of a fluorescent DPPE
analogue (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
labeled with Abberior STAR Red) in a fluid SLB of DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) accurately detected free
diffusion (i.e., best representation of the data
by a single-LogNorm fit), with an overall decrease in mobility depending
on the cholesterol content (Figure 1d). In contrast to the computer simulations, we did
not have any prior knowledge of the diffusion modes. We hence complemented
our weighted residual evaluation for the quality of the fitting and
model selection with maximum likelihood estimations, employing the
Bayesian information criterion (from which we could calculate the
relative likelihood (RL) value for any given model; see the Methods section and Supporting Information Figure S4a).33−35 Consistent with the weighted
residuals, the RL values confirmed free diffusion for the lipids in
the SLB by best representing the data with a single-LogNorm fit (insets
in Figure 1d and Supporting Information Figure S4a and Table S1).
Note, in the following, the most likely model (RL value equals 1)
was selected as the appropriate fitting model. The weighted residuals
were employed to evaluate the quality of the single- or double-LogNorm
fits in all experiments.

Next, we investigated the well-described
nanoscale diffusion dynamics
of fluorescent lipid analogues in living Ptk2 cells. Consistent with
previous reports using advanced FCS technologies such as super-resolution
STED-FCS,10,26,28,36,37 the phospholipid analogue
PE (Atto647N-DPPE) diffused freely, and the sphingomyelin (SM) analogue
(Atto647N-SM) showed hindered trapped diffusion, as revealed by either
single- and double-LogNorm fits to the transit time distributions
(Figure 2a,b and Supporting Information Figure S4b), respectively.
Trapping sites of SM were also illustrated by the occurrence of the
heterogeneities in the unprocessed sFCS data (correlation carpets)
of SM compared to PE (Figure 2a,b).26,28 Consequently, the statistical
analysis of large ensemble sFCS data acquired with a conventional
confocal microscope yielded the detection of a small fraction of molecules
undergoing trapped diffusion.

histograms (blue, as labeled) with LogNorm fits (red, single- or double-LogNorm
fit as labeled, best fit in red and respective inaccurate fit in magenta
and brackets) with respective weighted residuals (respective bottom
panels) for experimental data of (a) DPPE, (b) SM, and (c) GPI-GFP
in live Ptk2 cells and (d) GPI-GFP in Ptk2-cell-derived giant plasma
membrane vesicles (GPMVs) (see Supporting Information and Table S2 for fitted parameters).

To further demonstrate the applicability of our approach,
we examined
the diffusion of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-AP) fluorescently labeled
with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and compared the results of our
sFCS analysis to those from the diffusion dynamics of the GPI-APs
in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). While GPI-AP diffusion
appeared to be trapped in the cells, likely due to the interactions
with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, it was seemingly free in actin-depleted
GPMVs (Figure 2c,d
and Supporting Information Figure S4c)
as previously demonstrated.31 The statistical
analysis was therefore able to detect free and trapped diffusion of
GFP-tagged GPI-APs in the cell membrane.

Finally, we explored
the ability of our analysis pipeline to detect
hindered hop diffusion. To this end, we produced spatial random mesh
maps with an average boundary distance L in the simulations
(Supporting Information Figure S5a) mimicking
the cortical actin network beneath the membrane. The particles were
able to undergo free motion within the boundaries of the individual
meshes and random hop transitions for crossing the confinement barriers
with the probability phop (Supporting Information Figure S5a). To fully
characterize the motion conditions of the particles, we calculated
the phase diagram of those particles experiencing hop diffusion for
a range of hopping probabilities and characteristic average length
scale of mesh sizes for a given input diffusion coefficient (Supporting Information Figure S5b,c). Consistent
with the previous hindered trapped diffusion simulations, the hop
diffusion simulations revealed two processes in the transit time histograms,
with the second process dominant on short time scales. Statistical
analysis involving fitting and the maximum likelihood estimations
of the transit time histogram uncovered a combination of a LogNorm
and an exponential probability distribution function reporting on
the combination of free Brownian diffusion and a random hop diffusion
process, respectively (Supporting Information Figure S5d). Note that the same model selection criteria using
the RL values were applied (Supporting Information). Consequently, the statistical analysis of large ensemble sFCS
data also allowed the detection of a fraction of molecules undergoing
hop diffusion.

Conclusions
In this work, we highlighted
how different diffusion dynamics of
lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane of living cells can be
disclosed using conventional confocal microscopy. Revisiting well-established
experiments, we demonstrated how this statistical analysis pipeline
of scanning FCS data systematically and robustly differentiates free
from hindered diffusion. Whereas single-LogNorm quantifications allowed
the determination of free Brownian diffusion, double-LogNorm or LogNorm
and exponential analysis enabled the detection of hindered trapped
and hop diffusion dynamics.

In conclusion, the statistical analysis
provides a broadly applicable
methodology that revealed findings, which could previously
only be characterized by dedicated equipment and experimental procedures
such as spot variation or STED-FCS. Expanding the statistical analysis
further to quantification of full reaction diffusion dynamics including
transient binding and molecular cluster formation might offer one
technique for a more complete characterization of lipid and protein
dynamics in the near future. For example, reaction processes such
as transient binding events of transmembrane proteins to associated
structures such as the actin cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix
could also be quantified with the analysis pipeline. In light of the
broad applicability, straightforward implementation, usage of standard
fluorescent dyes at turn-key microscopes, we envisage statistical
sFCS analysis to become an important tool for characterizing nanoscale
heterogeneity of diffusion dynamics in the plasma membrane of living
cells.

Methods
Preparation of Supported
Lipid Bilayers
SLBs were prepared
by spin-coating as described elsewhere.31

A solution of 1 mg/mL total lipid concentration (either 100%
DOPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, USA) or 50% DOPC/50% cholesterol (Avanti
Polar Lipids)) both doped with DPPE-Abberior STAR Red (Abberior, Germany)
at a weight on weight ratio of 1:2000 in 1:2 methanol/chloroform was
spin-coated at 3200 rpm onto a clean 25 mm #1.5 glass coverslip (VWR,
UK). The resulting lipid film was hydrated with SLB buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) pH 7.4) and washed multiple times.

Glass coverslips
were cleaned using piranha edging (3:2 sulfuric
acid/hydrogen peroxide) for 2 h and not stored for longer than a week.

Cell Culture, Labeling, and Plasmid Transfection
Potorous
tridactylus epithelial kidney (Ptk2) cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich,
UK) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich).

For microscopy experiments,
the cells were seeded onto 25 mm glass coverslips and allowed to grow
to a confluence of about 75%. For sFCS experiments, the cells were
labeled with Atto647N-DPPE or Atto647N-sphingomyelin (AttoTec, Germany)
by incubating the cells at a lipid analogue concentration of 0.4 μg/μL
in L15 (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 15 min. After cells
were washed twice with L15, the experiments were performed at 37 °C.
The diffusion of the lipid analogues in the cellular membrane was
measured in the periphery of the cell at its bottom membrane.

Transfections of Ptk2 cells with GPI-anchored green fluorescent
protein were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The GPI-GFP plasmid was obtained
from Kai Simons’ Lab (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell
Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany).

Preparations of Giant Plasma
Membrane Vesicles
GPMVs
from Ptk2 cells were prepared as described previously.31 Cells were allowed to grow to a confluence of
about 75%. Cells were washed once with hypotonic (30%) then with 100%
GPMV buffer (containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 3 h in 2 mM dithiothreitol and 25 mM
paraformaldehyde at 37 °C. The GPMV-containing supernatant was
harvested, and for microscopy, the GPMVs were dropped onto poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated 25 mm coverslips. PLL coating was performed
by incubating the coverslip with 0.01% PLL solution (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times
with GPMV buffer. GPMVs were allowed to sink down and equilibrate
for 15 min at 37 °C. The diffusion was measured at the top membrane
of the GPMVs.

Microscopy
All imaging and sFCS
data were acquired
on a Zeiss 780 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany)
equipped with a 40× C-Apochromat NA 1.2 W Corr FCS objective
(Carl Zeiss). All sFCS experiments were performed using the GaAsP
detector (Channel S) in photon counting mode, and the pinhole was
set to 1 airy unit. For the GFP experiments, fluorescence was excited
using a 488 nm argon laser, and a single 488 dichroic was chosen;
for the Atto647N-labeled lipids, the fluorescence was excited using
a 633 nm He–Ne laser, and the 488/594/633 MBS was used. sFCS
experiments were acquired in line scan mode at a zoom of 40 with maximum
time-lapse repetitions at highest scanning speed. These settings resulted
in a line of 52 pixels (with a pixel size of 100 nm), a scanning frequency
of 2081 Hz, a pixel dwell time of 3.94 μs, and an overall measurement
time t of about 47 s. The measurements were saved
as .lsm5 files.

Simulations
Computer simulations
were performed as
Monte Carlo simulations in the programming language Python using the
nanosimpy repository on GitHub.20,38 For free Brownian diffusion,
we generated random tracks in a box of 2 μm × 8 μm.
One hundred particles were randomly distributed, and their movement
was simulated with diffusion coefficients D varying
from 0.01 to 1.00 μm2/s. The tracks were simulated
for t = 45 s with time steps of 3.94 μs (same
as the pixel dwell time) using periodic boundary conditions. The scanned
line of the sFCS experiments (hereafter referred to as sFCS line)
was placed in the center of the simulation box (microns away from
the boundaries). The sFCS line consisted of 52 pixels (length of 5.2
μm), where at every time step the molecules were passed through
a Gaussian-shaped observation spot (resembling the microscopes’
point spread function) to generate the intensity fluctuations. The
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian-shaped observation
spot was set to 200 nm to mimic confocal recordings. sFCS simulations
were sampled at 500, 2081, and 3500 Hz. The obtained transit times,
τD (from fitting the correlation curves), are related
to the diffusion coefficients implemented in the simulations according
to the following equation:  To demonstrate the capabilities of our statistical
analysis approach of sFCS data to identify nanoscale heterogeneous
non-Brownian diffusion, we also employed simulations on hindered diffusion
modes. For trapped and hop hindered diffusion, we adapted the simulations
from point STED-FCS31 to our needs in sFCS.
For trapped diffusion, again tracks of 100 molecules for 45 s using
time steps of 3.94 μs were created and passed through a Gaussian-shaped
observation spot, and sFCS was sampled at 2081 Hz. The stochastic
trapping model by molecular complex formation is outlined in Supporting Information Figure S3a. At every time
step, diffusing particles were re-evaluated whether they continued
free diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of 0.8 μm2/s or trap with a probability ptrap_on and a diffusion coefficient of 0.1 × 10–9 μm2/s, being basically immobile, or discontinued
trapping with the probability ptrap_off, respectively. Moreover, to ensure the simulations resembled the
trapping behavior (which was previously only recovered using super-resolved
STED-FCS recordings), we additionally to the confocal recordings (200
nm FWHM observation spot) simulated STED recordings with an observation
spot with a FWHM of 80 nm and determined the diffusion coefficients Dconf and DSTED from
fitting the confocal and STED-FCS data, respectively. Notably, the
ratio of DSTED and Dconf, the so-called Drat value,
equals 1 for free diffusion and is smaller than 1 for hindered trapped
diffusion and greater than 1 for hindered hop diffusion. Supporting Information Figure S3b shows a parameter
estimation of the trapping probabilities (with ptrap_on = ptrap_off) using the Drat value.

For the simulations of hindered
hop diffusion, we adapted the previously described point STED-FCS
simulations for sFCS.31,32 To this end, we calculated a
random meshwork with distinct barriers using Voronoi transformation
of randomly seeded points. This spatial hopping map was superimposed
with the diffusion simulation box and the sFCS measurement (compare Supporting Information Figure S5a). Particles
at the boundary had a given probability (phop) to transition to the neighboring compartment or to reside in the
same mesh compartment. For a diffusion coefficient of D = 0.2 μm2/s, we explored the parameter space employing
shorter (30 s) scanning STED-FCS measurements with a fwhm of 40 nm
in STED (yielding Drat) with 100 particles
in the simulation. Ultimately, we simulated hop hindered diffusion
with phop = 0.01, with a characteristic
length scale of the mesh size of L = 100 nm (yielding
a Voronoi region size given as √area of 186 nm) of 150 particles
for 45 s at a scanning frequency of 2081 Hz and a pixel dwell time
of 3.94 μs. The respective intensity carpets from the simulations
were outputted as .tiff files.
