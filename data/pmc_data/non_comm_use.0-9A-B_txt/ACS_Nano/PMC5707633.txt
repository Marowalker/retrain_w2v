Changes
in chemical and physical properties resulting from water
adsorption play an important role in the characterization and performance
of device-relevant materials. Studies of model oxides with well-characterized
surfaces can provide detailed information that is vital for a general
understanding of water–oxide interactions. In this work, we
study single crystals of indium oxide, the prototypical transparent
contact material that is heavily used in a wide range of applications
and most prominently in optoelectronic technologies. Water adsorbs
dissociatively already at temperatures as low as 100 K, as confirmed
by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), photoelectron spectroscopy,
and density functional theory. This dissociation takes place on lattice
sites of the defect-free surface. While the In2O3(111)-(1 × 1) surface offers four types of surface oxygen atoms
(12 atoms per unit cell in total), water dissociation happens exclusively
at one of them together with a neighboring pair of 5-fold coordinated
In atoms. These O–In groups are symmetrically arranged around
the 6-fold coordinated In atoms at the surface. At room temperature,
the In2O3(111) surface thus saturates at three
dissociated water molecules per unit cell, leading to a well-ordered
hydroxylated surface with (1 × 1) symmetry, where the three water
OWH groups plus the surface OSH groups are imaged
together as one bright triangle in STM. Manipulations with the STM
tip by means of voltage pulses preferentially remove the H atom of
one surface OSH group per triangle. The change in contrast
due to strong local band bending provides insights into the internal
structure of these bright triangles. The experimental results are
further confirmed by quantitative simulations of the STM image corrugation.

The interaction
of oxide surfaces
with water vapor under ambient conditions plays an important role
in thin-film device technology, as water adsorption or hydroxylation
of the surface influence, for example, the catalytic reactivity and
electronic properties. Thus, it is of paramount importance to study
the interaction of water with oxide surfaces. In the past decades,
the adsorption and dissociation of water at various temperatures has
been intensely studied on metal-oxide surfaces, including rutile TiO2(110),1,2 anatase TiO2(101),3,4 CeO2(111),5 CoO(111),6 MgO,7 ZnO,8,9 and Sr2RuO4;10 a
recent overview of water structures on oxides is given in ref (11).

In this work, we
focus on indium oxide, In2O3. This prototypical
transparent conductive oxide (TCO) combines optical
transparency in the visible range of light with electrical conductivity,
although it has a fundamental band gap of 2.93 eV.12,13 The intrinsic conductivity of this material can be enhanced by n-type
doping with Sn; the doped material is commonly referred to as indium
tin oxide (ITO). Reports regarding replacing ITO because of limited
In sources have been recently refuted (In is a byproduct of Zn refinement
with an abundance comparable to Ag), and the long-term supply appears
to be secure.14 In addition, the properties
of ITO are not met by any other prospective material candidate: ITO
is suitable for thin film growth, and it excels over other TCOs such
as doped SnO2 or ZnO.15 As such,
ITO is currently widely used as a contact electrode in liquid crystal
displays and solar cells,16 and recently,
it is also of increasing interest as a sensor and catalytic material.17,18 Thus, it seems that indium oxide will remain the TCO material of
choice for the foreseeable future.

Previous studies of water
adsorption on In2O3 were mainly conducted using
photoelectron spectroscopy. On the clean
surface, side peaks and shoulders on the high binding energy side
of the O1s core level signal were assigned to oxygen in the vicinity
of bulk oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups on the surface. After
water/air exposure, the new peak at 532–532.5 eV was variably
assigned to hydroxyl groups at the surface, “water-related
species”, and physisorbed oxygen. The different interpretations
might be due to the variety of samples used, including single crystals
and (un)doped thin films as well as nanoparticles and powders.19−27

The present investigation has been conducted on In2O3 single crystals exposing the (111) surface. This nonpolar
thermodynamically most stable facet28 is
principally present in nanoparticles and powders. The surface was
thoroughly characterized previously.29 In
the stoichiometric form that is achieved under oxidizing preparation
conditions, the material exhibits a simple (1 × 1) surface structure,
with some pronounced relaxations from the truncated bulk. Reducing
the surface results in single In adatoms; the reduction can either
be achieved thermally, by heating in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV),29 or chemically, by doping with an impurity atom.30 These adatoms adsorb preferentially at one specific
site of the unit cell, forming an ordered array.

This paper
reports on the interaction of the stoichiometric In2O3(111) surface with small amounts of water under
UHV conditions. The present investigations were carried out using
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The
experiments show that the In2O3(111) surface,
despite not exhibiting reactive defects such as intrinsic surface
oxygen vacancies,29 is very reactive toward
water in UHV conditions, resulting in water dissociation at lattice
sites already at 100 K. At room temperature (RT), the formation of
a well-ordered saturation layer with a (1 × 1) structure is observed,
which contains three dissociated water molecules per unit cell (i.e., three terminal OWH groups and three surface
OSH groups formed by the split-off protons). At 100 K,
the dissociation of water at the interface is followed by the adsorption
of molecular water.

In2O3 is a complex
oxide with a large bulk
unit cell. The hexagonal unit cell of the In2O3(111) surface with a lattice constant of 1.431 nm contains four inequivalent
types of surface oxygen atoms and 16 In atoms in two different coordinations.
The four 6-fold coordinated In atoms, In(6c), of the unit cell are
not evenly distributed but arranged in a close-packed triangle, bridged
by three symmetry-equivalent 3-fold coordinated O atoms, O(3c), at
the surface. These O atoms together with two neighboring 5-fold coordinated
In atoms are involved in the water splitting and the proton and hydroxyl
adsorption, thus making the unit cell inhomogeneous in terms of reactivity.
Overall, the water dissociation and formation of the OH groups can
be understood from the atomic arrangement of the low-coordinated O
and In atoms surrounding the high-coordinated In atoms at the surface.

Results
Overview:
Water Adsorption at Room Temperature
Exposing
the In2O3(111) surface to water at RT quickly
leads to saturation, with several different features observed in STM
along the way. Figure 1 provides an overview of the clean In2O3(111)
surface, an intermediate water coverage, and the saturated surface.
The clean In2O3(111) surface is shown in Figure 1a. Characteristic
dark triangles form the (1 × 1) structure. The inset in Figure 1a shows a high-resolution
image. The position of these triangles relative to the surface lattice
was identified previously29 (rectifying
an earlier, wrong assignment31). The atomic
model displayed in panel (d) was confirmed by DFT calculations.29 The In(6c) (blue) and their O(3c) neighbors
(light red) of the (1 × 1) surface form the dark triangle in
the STM images, which is an entirely electronic feature due to a low
contribution of the In(6c) atoms to the density of states in the lower-energy
range of the conduction band.29

after exposure to 0.2 L, and (c) saturated with water at room temperature.
The position in the unit cell and the orientation of the dark triangular
features characteristic of the clean surface are marked in the inset
of (a) with a yellow triangle. The orientation of the bright water-related
feature is highlighted with red triangles in the insets of (b,c).
(d) Atomic structure of the stoichiometric In2O3(111) surface (confirmed by DFT29). TSTM = (a) 5 K, (b) RT, and (c) 79 K.

When the surface is exposed to 1 Langmuir (L, where
1 L = 1.33
× 10–6 mbar s) of water at room temperature,
the STM contrast changes to bright triangles; see Figure 1c. Note, however, that these
bright triangles are rotated by 60° compared to the dark triangular
features of the clean surface, as emphasized by the yellow and red
markers in the insets in Figure 1a,c, respectively. As is shown in the following sections,
each bright triangle contains three dissociated water molecules.

That the bright, rotated triangles are related to water exposure
is already clear by considering an STM image taken after a somewhat
smaller water dosage (Figure 1b). After dosing 0.2 L (5 × 10–9 mbar
for 40 s) at room temperature, a few bright triangles are present.
The surface is covered by less bright features with a curved shape,
present in three orientations (marked in the inset). Below, these
curved features are assigned to two dissociated water molecules; addition
of a third molecule completes the structure and results in the bright
triangle.

Note that the surface does not show mirror symmetry
along any direction
(the surface unit cell can be assigned to plane group p3). The resulting
chirality of the surface is reflected in the three different, 120°
rotated orientations of the curved features mentioned earlier.

XPS: Determination
of Molecular versus Dissociated
Water
To determine whether water is adsorbed molecularly
or dissociatively, the STM measurements were complemented by photoelectron
spectroscopy. The evolution of the O1s core level was monitored in
XPS measurements following water dosages in steps of ∼0.1 to
1.6 L in total (the values include codosing from the residual gas;
not all of the spectra are shown here). Figure 2a displays the core level spectra of the
clean surface (black) and after water exposure at room temperature.
For the clean surface, the main O1s peak is located at ∼530.0
eV; when water adsorbs, a small shift to higher binding energies is
observed and a weak shoulder rises at ∼532 eV (it should be
noted that due to the high reactivity of the surface a nominally clean
sample already shows the presence of water in the O1s spectrum). Saturation
is reached after a dose of ∼0.3 L (orange curve), spectra obtained
at higher coverage [e.g., 1.6 L of water (red curve)]
are identical. Difference spectra are provided in the Supporting Information. The O1s shoulder is indicative
of surface hydroxyls, that is, dissociated water. This assignment
is supported by UPS measurements of the valence band region (Figure 2b), where the peaks
corresponding to the 3σ and 1π orbitals typical of hydroxyls32 are clearly apparent after saturating the surface
with water at RT.

Figure 2 Grazing-emission XPS spectra of the O1s core level and
the valence
band during water adsorption at different substrate temperatures.
(a) RT: The shoulder at high binding energies is due to hydroxylation;
saturation is reached at ∼0.3 L. (b) RT: Valence band spectra
of the clean In2O3(111) surface and after exposure
to 12.5 L H2O. (c) 100 K: The feature at 533.2 eV is due
to molecular water. In both sets of core level spectra, a small downward
band bending by ∼0.12 eV is apparent upon hydroxylation of
the surface.

The XPS measurements
were repeated with the sample kept at 100
K during both dosing and measurements (see Figure 2c). The total dose amounted to 10.8 L (again,
including codosing from the residual gas). The main peak shifts by
∼0.1 eV to higher binding energies. A shoulder at the higher
binding energy side increases with exposure of water, resulting in
peaks at ∼532 and ∼533 eV. Difference spectra are provided
in the Supporting Information. By comparing
the peak evolution and positions at RT and 100 K, it is evident that
water dissociates at RT, resulting
in a hydroxylated surface where additional water can neither adsorb
nor dissociate. At 100 K, water in direct contact with the In2O3(111) surface dissociates, while at higher doses,
molecular water also adsorbs, possibly as multilayers. STM images
of dissociated water are similar at both temperatures; molecular water
could not be imaged properly due to strong interactions with the STM
tip (see the Supporting Information).

Submonolayer Coverages of Water
On nominally clean
In2O3(111) surfaces, two different features
are already found in the STM images, which can be attributed to water
adsorption from the residual gas in the UHV chamber. An example is
given in Figure 3a
on a partly reduced surface, that is, a clean surface with a few dispersed
In adatoms (here, the sample was prepared by annealing the clean surface
at 300 °C in UHV for 20 min, which causes a low adatom coverage29). Two curved features are marked with arrows
in Figure 3a; note
that their shape is asymmetric; the same features are present after
purposely exposing the In2O3(111) surface to
0.2 L H2O (see Figure 1b). In addition, several smaller, oval features (white
circles) are observed in Figure 3a. The region with the curved features is enlarged
in panel (b), where the dark, triangularly shaped features of the
clean In2O3(111) surface are highlighted by
yellow triangles. The curved feature can occur
in three different orientations (inset Figure 1b), with their asymmetric shape resembling
the letter “J” (on all terraces for a given crystal)
due to the chirality of the In2O3(111) surface.
Thus, the handedness of the surface and therefore the proper orientation
of the atomic model can be easily detected by the “J”
or “L” (which would reflect the other handedness) shape
of these features. The small ovals (marked by white circles) are also
present in three equivalent orientations (not shown here).

Figure 3 Very low coverages
of water on In2O3(111).
(a) Partially reduced surface with few In adatoms29 and single water-related features that appear as curves
(arrows, two dissociated water molecules) and small ovals (white circles,
one dissociated water molecule). (b) Zoomed image of the framed region
of (a). The orientation of the curved features is indicated, as well
as the dark triangles next to them. (c) After exposure to ∼0.2
L at RT water, the surface is fully covered with the curved features
and bright triangles (red triangles, three dissociated water molecules).
The grid centering the dark triangles (as indicated in (b)) shows
that both species occupy the same region within the unit cell. TSTM = (a,b) RT and (c) 5 K.

Knowing the position of the curved features within the unit
cell
makes it possible to determine the position of the bright triangles,
which locally form the saturated structure. This is illustrated in Figure 3c for a surface exposed
to ∼0.2 L of water. The curved features cover the entire surface,
together with bright triangles. Applying the same grid that centered
the dark triangles in panel (b) shows that both the curved features
and the bright triangles occupy the same spot in the unit cell as
the dark triangles of the clean In2O3(111) surface.
This is an indication that the curved features convert into the bright
triangles upon further water dosing, and the bright triangles are
above the In(6c) triangles of the substrate (but rotated differently).

STM-Tip-Induced Manipulation of the Water Layer
The
curved and oval features are both immobile at 79 K and are stable
when scanned with the STM up to (sample) bias voltages of +3.0 V.
At higher voltages, the tip starts to interact with these features
(see the Supporting Information).

Exposing the In2O3(111) surface at RT to >0.3
L of water leads to a saturated surface. The large-area STM image
of Figure 4a was obtained
after exposing the surface to 1 L of water, which is well beyond the
dose required to reach saturation. However, the surface does not look
uniform due to dark features that are randomly distributed across
the surface. The density of these dark features varies for each surface
preparation, but a few were always present, especially when the sample
temperature was slightly elevated (e.g., after annealing
during sample preparation) during the water exposure. Figure 4b presents a closer look at
these dark features; they occupy the space otherwise taken by the
bright triangles. To guide the eye, the nearest neighboring (n.n.)
bright triangles are highlighted with white dots around a single (6
n.n.) and two adjoining (8 n.n.) dark features. The internal structure
of these dark features is investigated in panel (c), where six of
them are marked by arrows. The overall shape of this feature resembles
a triangle (indicated in white), pointing up in the figure. Moreover,
one can identify three orientations of this feature, where the somewhat
brighter region is either in the top (labeled “1”),
left (“2”), or right (“3”) corner of the
white triangle. For better visibility, a high-pass filtered version
of this image is shown in Figure 4d. The white marker triangle is placed at the same
position as in (c), and superimposed curved lines indicate the three
orientations of the internal structure. Located at the convex side
of the curve, an additional dot is always present [hardly visible
in the unprocessed STM image here due to its small apparent height
of ∼17 pm, marked by a small black ring (compare also Figure 5c–i)]. For
a better view and comparison, these symbols are placed only on one
feature of orientation “1”, and the three remaining
features are encircled in black in Figure 4d.

dosing 1 L of water at RT. (a) Overview image with dark dots/vacancies
on the terraces indicated by arrows. (b) Terrace with OH vacancies
in the hydroxyl overlayer. (c) Close-up on these vacancies; some elongated
species are visible inside. (d) Same image as in (c) but high-pass

Figure 5 Manipulation of single OH groups at T = 79 K:
(a–g) Applying single voltage pulses with the STM tip while
scanning (the slow scanning direction is downward). The tip is placed
on top of the center of the bright triangle when the pulse (+2.8 V)
is triggered. The “×” in (b) marks the position
where the first pulse was applied while acquiring this image. (h)
Same image as in (g), indicating the species remaining on the surface.
(i) High-pass filtered version of the image before for better visibility
of the surface area after removing 10 hydroxyl groups. The curved
features and dots are indicated.

In order to test whether
these dark features are indeed partial
vacancies in the saturated structure, bias pulses (+2.8 V sample bias, i.e., the tip is negative) were applied to a defect-free
region of the surface of Figure 4. The first three panels of Figure 5 show (a) the intact surface, (b) the image
where a pulse is applied while scanning at the position marked by
an ×, and the same region in a subsequent scan (c). During this
sequence, one bright triangle was transformed into a dark feature/vacancy
(curved feature plus dot feature). The pulses were repeated on the
surrounding bright triangles until 10 of them (arranged in a large
triangle) were transformed. Figure 5g–i shows in more detail the area where 10 bright
triangles were transformed. (Note that there is a defect in the upper
part of the transformed region, which happened after a manipulation.)
In panel (h), symbols that indicate the orientations of the remaining
curved species are superimposed on the STM image from panel (g). The
same image is displayed in panel (i), where the contrast is enhanced
by applying a high-pass filter. The curved features have an apparent
height of ∼65 pm, and the dots measure ∼17 pm in height
and the bright triangles ∼150 pm with respect to the manipulated
area. The corrugation of the undisturbed hydroxylated surface is ∼60
pm.

Moreover, the transformation does not only work with single
voltage
pulses, but it is also induced by scanning a larger area at high bias
voltage, although a higher value of +3.6 V is necessary to transform
the entire scanned area at once (see the Supporting Information).

DFT: Configurations of Adsorbed Water Molecules
To
solve the atomic structures of the adsorbed water molecules on the
In2O3(111) surface, a series of DFT calculations
was performed. First, we determined the preferred adsorption geometry
of a single water molecule in the primitive (1 × 1) surface unit
cell. Both molecular and dissociative configurations were considered.
The calculations show that intact water molecules preferentially coordinate via their oxygen atom, OW, to the unsaturated
In(5c) sites, whereas upon dissociative adsorption, the proton converts
an O(3c) surface oxygen, OS, to a hydroxyl (OSH), and the remaining OWH group from the water molecule
takes either an on-top or a bridging position at the In(5c) sites.
The In2O3(111) surface contains four nonequivalent
5-fold coordinated In(5c) and four nonequivalent 3-fold coordinated
O(3c) sites per (1 × 1) surface unit cell. DFT calculations were
performed for all nonequivalent sites probing both molecular and dissociative
adsorption (see the Supporting Information). We find that dissociative adsorption is clearly preferred (binding
energy 1.28 versus 0.73 eV). In the most favorable
configuration (see Figure 6a), the proton adsorbs on one of the three O(3c) binding to
two In(6c) and one In(5c) (i.e., within the area
that is imaged as a dark triangle in STM). The preference of this
O(3c) site for the proton is an electronic effect, as shown by a detailed
analysis in the Supporting Information.
The remaining OWH group adsorbs in a bridging position
between the two In(5c) that are closest to the OSH group.
In the calculated STM image (see Figure 6a), the two OSH and OWH hydroxyl groups appear as a single oval-shaped protrusion.

Figure 6 DFT calculations
of water on In2O3(111).
(a) One, (b) two, and (c) three dissociated water molecules per surface
unit cell. The atoms of the surface are color-coded as in Figure 1. The O atom originating
from the water molecule (yellow) and the hydrogen (white) are enlarged
in the superimposed images for better visibility. The middle and bottom
panel show the STM contrast and the apparent height in line profiles,
respectively, calculated using the Bardeen approach.

Subsequently, a second and a third water molecule
were added to
the (1 × 1) surface unit cell, again probing molecular and dissociative adsorption at all nonequivalent surface
sites (see the Supporting Information).
In the most favorable configurations, these additional water molecules
are also dissociated. They occupy the two sites that are symmetry-equivalent
to the adsorption site of the first water molecule (see Figures 6b,c). In the calculated STM
images, two dissociated water molecules appear as a single curved
feature, and three dissociated water molecules are visible as a single
bright triangle. The binding energy per molecule decreases slightly
from 1.28 to 1.23 and 1.18 eV when going from one to two and three
water molecules, respectively. The reason for this decrease is a small,
substrate-mediated effective repulsion between the molecules due to
surface re-relaxations.33 The adsorption
of water molecules leads to a partial lifting of the relaxations of
the surface atoms that occurred upon cleavage of the crystal. This
re-relaxation contributes to the water binding energy. However, this
energy gain is available to its full extent only for the first adsorbate,
and it is reduced for the second and third molecule33 (see the Supporting Information).

Finally, when going to higher surface coverages beyond three
(dissociated)
molecules per unit cell, we find that for these additional molecules
molecular adsorption becomes more favorable than dissociation (see
the Supporting Information). The binding
energy of these water molecules is more than 0.3 eV lower compared
to the energy of the dissociated molecules in the saturated structure.
Converting the binding energies per molecule into energy gains per
area upon water adsorption and representing the results in form of
a surface phase diagram34 (see Figure 7) shows that the
structure with three dissociated water molecules is the thermodynamically
most stable one for a wide window in the chemical potential of water
(corresponding to partial pressure conditions around UHV at RT). The
higher water coverages, which include molecular water, appear as thermodynamically
most stable structures only at higher chemical potentials. In UHV,
they exist only well below room temperature.

of the In2O3(111) surface
as a function of the water chemical potential. In the top x-axis, the chemical potential has been converted to a water
partial pressure scale for the temperature of 300 K. The red-shaded
area shows the stability range of hydroxylated surfaces structures
by water dissociation. The vertical dashed black line at −0.57
eV indicates the chemical potential of liquid water at RT.35

Based on these DFT results, all of the features observed
in the
STM measurements are clearly identified. We assign (i) the bright
triangles to three water molecules adsorbed dissociatively at the
three symmetry-equivalent sites formed by the O(3c) and In(5c) bridges
closest to the corner of the unit cell; (ii) the curved feature appearing
at lower water dose to two water molecules adsorbed at any two of
the same three sites, which gives rise to the three orientations of
the curved feature; and (iii) the oval feature to a single dissociated
water molecule. This is summarized in Table 1. Also consistent with the experiments are
the relative orientations of the curved features and the bright triangles
with respect to the orientation of the characteristic dark triangles
of the water-free surface. Furthermore, the corrugation profiles in Figure 6 indicate a much
higher apparent height for the triangles than for the curved features, as observed in the experiment as well. Finally,
full dissociation (i.e., no molecular adsorption)
and a saturation coverage of three water molecules per surface unit
cell (6 OH groups) are both in full agreement with the XPS measurements.

Additional
DFT calculations were performed to understand the results
of the tip-induced manipulations of the saturated water layer (see Figure 5). In the STM images,
the saturated water layer is formed by bright triangles, consisting
of six OH groups (three OSH and three OWH) from
three dissociated water molecules. Upon stripping off species with
the STM tip, the bright triangle converts into the curved species
with a dot next to it. The curved features have already been identified
to consist of two dissociated water molecules. Thus, the obvious explanation
of the STM images is that one OH group or its hydrogen atom has been
removed by the tip-induced manipulations and the remaining other OH
group from the third dissociated water molecule is now visible as
a dot next to the curved feature. However, the question remains as
to which OH group has been removed or altered and which OH group (OSH or OWH) remains on the surface after the tip-induced
manipulations. From the STM images, the adsorption site of the dot
is positioned in the In(5c) region, suggesting that the proton from
the OSH is missing.

To address this question thoroughly,
DFT calculations were started
from the structure with three dissociated water molecules, which is
initially imaged as a bright triangle (compare Figures 5a, 6c, and 8a). From this structure, either the terminal OWH unit or the proton from the OSH group was removed,
see Figure 8e,f. The
corresponding STM images for the relaxed structures are shown in Figure 8c,d together with
representative line scans in panel (b). From these images and the
line scans, we can directly conclude that the proton of one of the
three OSH groups has been removed in the STM experiments.
Only in this case (Figure 8c,e), the remaining OH group (OWH) appears as a
distinct dot next to the curved feature in the STM image. Furthermore,
the apparent height of the whole structure is significantly reduced
as observed in the experiment. The reason is that removing a neutral
H atom also removes an electron from the surface and thus creates
a hole in the valence band. This corresponds to a p-type defect (acceptor)
with a locally reduced electron density. The removal of a H atom is
actually equivalent to the addition of a neutral OH to the surface,
which accepts an electron from the surface to become a negatively
charged OH–. Such p-type defects in semiconductors
are commonly imaged as depressions in empty states.36 In contrast, removing a terminal OWH group leaves
the STM image and the associated corrugation profile almost unchanged
(see Figure 8b,d).
The remaining OSH group is too close to the other four
OH groups of the curved feature so that it cannot be resolved as a
separate dot in the STM image. Furthermore, by removing a neutral
OWH group, an n-type defect is formed that locally increases
the electron density due to the donation of an electron. Similar as
before, the removal of the OWH leaves a neutral H atom
from the dissociated water molecule behind, which acts as an electron
donor. The increase in the electron density compensates the loss in
geometrical height, so that the apparent height remains almost unchanged,
which would contradict the experimental observation.

Discussion
In
this combined STM/XPS and DFT study, we demonstrate that single
water molecules adsorb dissociatively on the In2O3(111) surface, forming two types of OH groups, OWH and
OSH. The energetically most favored adsorption site for
the H+ is one of the O(3c) bridging to two In(6c) atoms
and one In(5c) (see Figure 6). The OH– adsorbs directly next to the
proton, bridging two In(5c) atoms; one of these In(5c) is shared with
the O(3c) where the proton adsorbs. The adsorption of the OWH also leads to a local distortion (i.e., lifting
of the relaxation) of the surface by pulling these two (former) In(5c)
closer together, resulting in a decrease of 0.48 Å from their
relaxed distance of 4.08 Å. The symmetry of the surface offers
three equivalent adsorption sites per unit cell that are occupied
with decreasing adsorption energies per water molecule due to a substrate-mediated
effective repulsion as discussed earlier. The surface gets saturated
once these sites are occupied, leading to bright triangular features
in the STM images. Additional water molecules cannot adsorb on the
surface at RT in UHV, as observed experimentally, which is also reflected
in the DFT adsorption energies of additional water molecules.

Moreover, this demonstrates that the unit cell of the In2O3(111) surface is heterogeneous in terms of reactivity,
and the dissociation takes place on lattice sites of the intact surface,
without any preference for step edges or defective regions on the
surface. In2O3 is a complex oxide with a large
bulk unit cell due to ordered anion vacancies in the fluorite lattice
(bixbyite structure). The unit cell of the (111) surface features
four inequivalent types of 3-fold coordinated surface oxygen atoms,
O(3c), each represented by three atoms—but only one type is
involved in the proton adsorption. The reactivity of these O(3c) atoms
is determined by the coordination of their neighboring In atoms, and
those sharing bonds with two In(6c) and one In(5c) are the most reactive,
while the remaining three different types of O(3c) surrounded mostly
by In(5c) do not contribute to this reaction. The four In(6c) atoms
are not evenly distributed within the surface unit cell (which contains
16 In atoms in total); instead they are clustered, resulting in the
heterogeneous reactivity.

The surface is saturated after the
adsorption of three molecules
per unit cell, which results in a rather low coverage/density of OH
groups considering the size of the unit cell and the number of surface
oxygen atoms; it corresponds to 1.7 × 1014 cm–2 dissociated water molecules or 3.4 × 1014 cm–2 OH groups (counting both OWH and OSH). At RT, even a very small amount of water in
the pristine UHV environment at base pressures <2 × 10–10 mbar is sufficient to saturate the surface completely
within a few hours.

While water dissociation on an oxide at
RT is not entirely surprising,
the observation of water molecules not dissociated at defects but
at regular lattice sites at temperatures as low as 100 K is unusual,
and the formation of a well-ordered and almost defect-free hydroxyl
layer is intriguing. Defects always found in the hydroxyl layer are
partial vacancies where one water molecule (OWH– + H+) or a H atom is missing. This can be explained either
by a slightly elevated sample temperature during the water exposure
due to the previous sample heating, or a defect in the In2O3(111) lattice [e.g., a missing O(3c)
and thus less In(6c)]. The hydroxylation on In2O3(111) is self-limited, as the OH groups block the reactive sites.
Apart from some relaxations of the substrate, the OH groups do not
change their adsorption sites or structure depending on the water
coverage. According to the phase diagram in Figure 7, molecular water is expected to form ordered
structures on top of the hydroxyl layer, although only at temperatures
below RT or high partial pressures. This is also reflected in the
binding energy of the molecular species discussed earlier, and the
XPS data obtained at 100 K. Similar temperature dependencies for molecular
adsorption of single water molecules are found on other oxides, although
dissociation may still occur at defect sites such as O vacancies,37 due to water–water interaction or “unsuitable”
atomic distances for molecular adsorption on the surface.11 Dense structures formed at low temperatures
have been found to be either purely molecular or of a mixed nature.
A peculiar example is ZnO(101̅0), where a purely molecular phase
coexists with a mixed phase that is formed by water molecules which
are constantly dissociating and recombining.9

The predominant investigation technique used in this work
is low-temperature
STM, in particular, taking advantage of local manipulations of the
surface with the STM tip. The quantitative simulations in Figures 6 and 8 provide a clear interpretation of the resulting structures.
Water-related species are desorbed by single voltage pulses (the proton
from the OSH) with the STM tip as well as by scanning larger
areas at a high bias voltage (the proton from the OSH of
the saturated surface and both the OWH and the proton from
low coverages; see Supporting Information). We have strong indications that the desorption of the proton can
be realized purely by the electric field, as we get the same results
by applying the voltage pulse using a conducting STM or a noncontact
AFM tip with an insulating particle at the tip apex. During the past
decade, such controlled manipulations have been developed as a valuable
tool to identify and differentiate adsorbed surface entities with
atomic-scale precision, for example, by their charge state,38 as well as subsurface species, such as oxygen
vacancies in anatase TiO2.39 Furthermore, such manipulations allow us to study the tip–adsorbate
and adsorbate–surface interactions and to trigger single chemical
reactions.40 Classified by the mechanism,
STM manipulations operate via forces (pushing, pulling,
sliding),41 electric field (field evaporation
and diffusion),40 or electric current (inelastic
tunneling, vibrational and electronic excitations).38,42 The manipulation of weakly interacting species, such as water molecules
on metals and oxide surfaces, usually succeeds by tuning the electric
field between the tip and surface, via inelastic
tunneling, or a combination of both.43 It
has been demonstrated that such manipulations allow controlled studies
of water diffusion,7,44 clustering,44,45 dissociation,7,46,47 and desorption.47

The selective
desorption of one H per unit cell from the saturated
surface was vital for unraveling the configuration of the water-related
features and, together with DFT calculations, provides detailed information
on the adsorption sites and geometry of the dissociated water overlayer.
The desorption of one proton from one of the three OSH
could be confirmed by DFT calculations by reproducing the “fingerprint”
of the manipulated area, that is, the observed features combined with
the change in contrast due to local band bending at the p-type defect.
The different features seen at low water coverage in the STM images
as well as after the described manipulation are summarized in Table 1. They correspond
to 1, 2, 2.5 (manipulated), and 3 split water molecules adsorbed at
the same dark triangle [same In(6c)/O(3c) region of the unit cell].

Conclusions
In this work, we present the hydroxylation of In2O3(111) via water exposure at room temperature
as investigated with STM, XPS, and DFT methods. Indium oxide is a
material that has been commonly used in devices for more than three
decades, and it is surprising that its reactivity toward water has
not previously been thoroughly studied. Even more surprisingly, the
In2O3(111) surface (despite its complex crystal
structure and unit cell) behaves like a “textbook example”
when exposed to water: A well-ordered hydroxyl layer with (1 ×
1) symmetry is formed, where both the OH– and H+ remain at the surface as OWH and OSH groups, respectively. The saturation coverage corresponds to three
dissociated water molecules per unit cell, the dissociation takes
place at lattice sites, and all of the OWH and OSH occupy equivalent sites. This demonstrates that only 1/4 of the
surface oxygen atoms O(3c) are involved in the water dissociation
and proton adsorption, with their reactivity being determined by the
coordination of the neighboring In atoms. The reactive sites are not
evenly distributed within the unit cell but located close to each
other, making the unit cell heterogeneous in terms of reactivity.
Moreover, the OH groups do not diffuse or rearrange but block the
reactive dissociation sites, thereby limiting the maximum degree of
surface hydroxylation. The result is a well-defined and stable hydroxyl
layer covering the entire surface with a surprisingly low saturation
coverage.

Methods
The STM measurements
were performed using two different UHV systems:
one equipped with a low-temperature STM (Omicron LT-STM) operating
at 79 and 5 K and the other one with a room temperature STM (Omicron
STM-1). The LT-STM system consists of an analysis chamber (base pressure
5 × 10–12 mbar) and an adjacent preparation
chamber (base pressure 7 × 10–11 mbar). The
STM-1 is housed in a smaller one-chamber system with a base pressure
of 2 × 10–10 mbar. Electrochemically etched
W tips were cleaned by sputtering, and the metallic behavior of the
tip was frequently restored in situ on auxiliary
Au(110) and Cu(100) single crystals. XPS measurements in grazing emission
(60°/65° off the surface normal) were conducted using both
a conventional X-ray source in the LT-STM chamber (Mg Kα radiation,
1253.6 eV) and synchrotron radiation at the beamline I311 of the Maxlab
II facility in Lund, Sweden.

A glass tube with a few drops of
distilled water (Milli-Q) was
attached to the UHV systems via a high-precision
leak valve. The tube was also connected via a separate
pumping line to a turbo-molecular pump. Prior to the experiments,
the water was cleaned by several freeze–pump–thaw cycles
and finally checked with a mass spectrometer for cleanliness. In the
LT-STM chamber, the crystal was held at 100 K while exposed to water
vapor in the preparation chamber (i.e., in
situ dosing during the XPS measurements); in the RT-STM,
water was dosed while scanning. During water exposure, the pressure
was kept below 5 × 10–9 mbar. Included in the
quoted values is inadvertent dosing from the residual vacuum after
closing the leak valve.

The In2O3 single
crystals were grown at the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory using the flux method. The cubic (001)-oriented
crystals have a size of 1–3 mm.48 They were oriented and cut-polished by the company SurfaceNet. The
In2O3(111) surface was cleaned by several cycles
of sputtering with Ar+ ions (1 keV) followed by annealing
at 450–500 °C either in UHV or O2. The last
annealing step was always carried out in O2 including a
cool down to 150 °C that leads to atomically flat surfaces with
a relaxed bulk-truncated and stoichiometric surface structure. As
described in ref (29), a more reducing treatment in UHV results in excess In adatoms on
the surface. The O2 pressure (backfill) necessary to suppress
adatom formation varies between (1–6) × 10–7 mbar, depending on the UHV chamber setup. The appearance of the
clean In2O3(111) surface in the STM is described
in the same ref (29). The STM images presented in this work were measured on several
crystals, at RT, 79 K, and 5 K, all showing the same features upon
water adsorption and manipulation.

DFT calculations were carried
out with the periodic plane-wave
code PWscf of the Quantum Espresso software package,49 using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation
functional,50 Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials,51 and a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 30
Ry. The surface structures were represented by periodically repeated
slabs with a thickness of four O12–In16–O12 triple layers and a primitive (1 × 1)
surface unit cell. The supercell for the stoichiometric water-free
surface thus contained 160 atoms. The atoms in the bottom half of
the slab were kept fixed at their bulk positions, whereas the atoms
in the top half and the adsorbed water molecules were relaxed until
a force convergence threshold of 5 meV/Å for the largest residual
force component was reached. A (2 × 2 × 1) Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh for Brillouin zone integrations was sufficient
for obtaining well-converged energies and geometries. For more details
on the computational setup, see refs (29) and (30).

The STM images and STM line profiles were determined
by evaluating
Bardeen’s tunneling formula using our own implementation.52 The advantage of this approach is that the STM
tunneling current for a given position of the tip above the substrate
is calculated fully ab initio, without any adjustable
parameter, from the tip and the substrate wave functions. This allows
a direct, quantitative comparison to be made between the calculated
and measured STM height profiles. The STM tip was modeled by a small
pyramid of five tungsten atoms supported on a (100)-oriented tungsten
slab. All images represent constant-current conditions, that is, the
brightness reflects the height of the STM tip above the surface for
a given current.
