Although
the relevance of mechanotransduction in cell signaling
is currently appreciated, the mechanisms that drive this process remain
largely unknown. Mechanical unfolding of proteins may trigger distinct
downstream signals in cells, providing a mechanism for cellular mechanotransduction.
Force-induced unfolding of talin, a prominent focal adhesion protein,
has been demonstrated previously for a small portion of its rod domain.
Here, using single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM), we show
that the entire talin rod can be unfolded by mechanical extension,
over a physiological range of forces between 10 and 40 pN. We also
demonstrate, through a combination of smAFM and steered molecular
dynamics, that the different bundles within the talin rod exhibit
a distinct hierarchy of mechanical stability. These results provide
a mechanism by which different force conditions within the cell control
a graduated unfolding of the talin rod. Mechanical unfolding of the
rod subdomains, and the subsequent effect on talin’s binding
interactions, would allow for a finely tuned cellular response to
internally or externally applied forces.

Research
in recent years has
demonstrated the relevance of a cell’s ability to interpret
the mechanical properties of its surroundings. This ability of a cell
to convert mechanical signals into signaling cascades, i.e., mechanotransduction, has been shown to drive
a wide variety of cellular phenomena including cancer progression
and stem cell differentiation.1,2 Despite an appreciation
of the importance of these mechanical signals, the mechanisms by which
cells translate them remain unknown.

One of the focus areas
for finding a mechanism of cellular mechanotransduction
concerns the integrin-mediated adhesions. Integrins, as transmembrane
proteins, provide a connection between the interior of the cell and
the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds it. As anchorage points
for the cell, they orchestrate the bidirectional mechanical communication
of the cell with the ECM. Integrins are important not just for stable
cell–ECM adhesion but also for cellular force generation and
motility. As well as providing this connection, integrins help to
recruit a cluster of intracellular proteins. In this process, early
adhesions (focal complexes) are matured to protein-rich plaques called
focal adhesions. This process is tightly regulated by mechanical signals:
Contractile actomyosin cytoskeleton and adequate stiffness in the
extracellular matrix are needed to drive the adhesion maturation process.3−5 Furthermore, it is possible to control the size of the adhesion
plaques by applying external force locally.6,7 Thus,
integrin-mediated adhesions have been a key area for investigations
into cellular mechanotransduction. In particular, studies into the
mechanosensitivity of these adhesions and how this might lead to cellular
mechanotransduction have been centered on the focal adhesion protein
talin.

Due to its unique and prominent position as a mechanical
linkage
between the ECM-bound integrins and the cellular cytoskeleton, talin
has been hypothesized to be the crucial mechanosensitive molecule
in focal adhesions.8 Talin is essential
for cellular spreading9,10 and is responsible for early
connections between integrin and actin cytoskeleton.11 Investigations into the mechanosensitivity of talin have
so far been focused on talin’s interaction with vinculin, another
focal adhesion protein. Our previous studies were the first to demonstrate
this mechanosensitivity, both in silico and experimentally.
We showed that force-induced stretching of the talin rod exposes new
cryptic vinculin binding sites (VBS) and increases the vinculin recruitment
to the talin rod.12,13 Similar studies by others have
supported and enhanced this concept.14,15 All these
studies, however, were focused around a small, N-terminal subregion
of the rod, bundles R1–R3. The compact nature of this region
and the abundance of VBSs leads to the possibility that this region
alone is responsible for talin’s mechanosensing, while the
remainder of the rod, proposed to be linear in structure, is responsible
for force propagation.16 Up until now,
however, the response of this linear region to force has never been
investigated.

The mechanical load applied to cellular components
may vary substantially
depending on the cellular substructure and the cellular event. Thus,
it is possible that a subpopulation of the proteins is under high
load in certain situations, when responsible for particular cellular
functions. Experimental methods have emerged that allow measurement
of these forces applied to intracellular proteins such as talin and
vinculin.9,17 The fact that talin is the most prominent
candidate for consideration as a cellular mechanosensor means that
the elucidation of the biomechanical properties of the full rod in
response to force is indispensable to the understanding of its function.
The presence of numerous relevant binding sites in the remainder of
the rod (R4–R13), including six VBSs and binding sites for
other proteins including RIAM, synemin and DLC1, means that the response
of this region to force could have a profound effect on the modulation
of talin’s interactions.18−20

There are, however, difficulties
associated with studying the full-length
talin rod using single-molecule techniques. First, it is a large,
amphipathic domain (∼2000 aa) and as a result can be difficult
to handle. Second, the length of the fully stretched talin rod domain
is longer than the maximum travel distance (<1 μm) allowed
by high-resolution single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM)
setups. Third, studies conducted on the complete rod would lose information
about how the observed unfolding relates to individual bundle structures.

In this study, we circumvent these restrictions by separating the
rod into smaller subdomains. These subdomains are then analyzed using
a state of the art smAFM setup, combined with recent advances in single-molecule
stretching techniques. The subdomains are inserted into polyprotein
constructs; these constructs contain flanking, fingerprinting molecules
that allow for correct trace determination through a characteristic
unfolding pattern (Figure 1).13 The constructs also contain
an N-terminal HaloTag enzyme that, when coupled to ligand-prepared
surfaces, ensures that the talin subdomains are extended in the desired
orientation.21 This unique combination
of smAFM techniques allows us to establish an outline of the unfolding
pattern of the talin rod. We also used all-atom steered molecular
dynamics (SMD) simulations on each of the individual bundles, to provide
a profile for how this applied tension is rearranging these bundles
at a structural level. These complementary data sets allow us to compare
the relative stabilities of the bundles for the full rod and thus
propose a sequence for how talin might unravel under force application in vivo.

events. (b, c) Not to scale.

Results
Generation of Talin Rod Constructs
The talin rod is
comprised solely of α-helical bundles, and the structures of
these individual bundles have been resolved using structural biology
methods. In this study, we utilized the current structural model of
the full-length talin rod.1 The talin rod
consists of 62 α-helices, which then form into bundles (R1–R13),
each containing four or five helices. The talin rod was first divided
into five separate fragments in order to characterize their unfolding
properties under force application by smAFM. The fragments were based
on the best available knowledge of the organization of the bundles
for the whole rod (Figure 1a): the boundaries between the fragments were placed similarly
to those used to fragment the rod for the determination of the crystal
structures.16 In the case of two of the
fragments, the boundaries were dictated by their structures: bundle
R8 is inserted between the third and fourth helices of R7, and thus
they were expressed together; and R11 and R12 share a common, elongated
helix between them. The fragment R1–R3 has previously been
analyzed and thus was included as a reference to those earlier works.2 The remaining bundles, R4–R6 and R9–R10,
were clustered into two fragments. R13 was excluded, as talin’s
primary actin binding site occurs in this bundle, and thus it is unlikely
to be extended from its N and C termini. The details of the polyprotein
expression plasmids are provided in Supporting Information Figure 1.

In order to improve the efficiency
of data capture and analysis, these fragments were engineered into
polyprotein constructs (Figure 1b). All constructs were produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity according to previous protocols.13,22 These constructs ensure that the talin fragments were extended in
the correct orientation, i.e., from
their N and C termini. The use of an N-terminal HaloTag protein and
C-terminal cysteine residue has been shown previously to provide specific,
stable attachment of polyproteins to the Halo-ligand-functionalized
smAFM surface and gold-coated cantilever tip, respectively.3 The immunoglobulin domain, I27, from
titin has been used to provide a molecular “fingerprint”
to determine valid force extension traces.13,23 Only traces which displayed the unfolding of the HaloTag and the
characteristic “sawtooth” pattern of at least three
I27 domains were accepted for analysis (Figure 1c).

Unfolding Pattern of Talin
Rod Fragments
The talin
rod constructs were extended at a constant velocity (400 nm/s) in
order to investigate how the individual fragments unfold. The molecular
fingerprint, first used to filter for valid traces as discussed above,
was then used to match traces to one another by aligning the sawtooth
patterns of the I27 domains. These aggregated overlaid
traces show that the talin rod fragments unfold in a consistent manner
with defined unfolding events (Figure 2a–e). For each trace, these unfolding events
were then fitted to a worm-like chain model, and the unfolding length
of each event was measured, with the HaloTag peak as a reference point.
Histograms of these unfolding lengths demonstrate the number of discrete
unfolding events and the regular intervals at which they occur (Figure 2f–j).

force extension traces reveal the unfolding pattern of each fragment.
The fingerprints of each trace were used for alignment, revealing
the number of unfolding events and the extension associated with each.

the extension of each event is also shown. (f–j) Histograms

associated with each unfolding event was measured, using HaloTag as
a reference point. The x-axes have been reversed
so that the order of the unfolding peaks in the histogram matches
the order of unfolding in the traces, i.e., the furthest peak from HaloTag is the first to unfold. Red dashed
lines show Gaussian fits applied to the histograms. Extension lengths
are summarized in Supporting Information Table S1. (a, f) R1–R3, number of traces analyzed, n = 101. (b, g) R4–R6, n = 76. (c,
h) R7–R8, n = 82. (d, (i) R9–R10, n = 91. (e, j) R11–R12, n = 103.

For R4–R6, R9–R10,
and R11–R12, the number
of unfolding events is the same as the number of bundles in the fragment.
This indicates that each bundle has a single dissociation event that
allows it to unravel. The distances between the peaks of the histograms
can be analyzed to determine the length of unfolding that occurs for
each event. These lengths tend to be 10–30% shorter than the
theoretical fully extended length of the amino acid chain for each
bundle (Supporting Information Table S1).24 This indicates that either the bundles partially
unravel before their main dissociation event or that, after they dissociate,
they still retain some of their α-helical structure.

For
R1–R3, a three bundle construct, only two events were
usually observed, although in several traces the anticipated three
events were discernible. This apparent difference is explained by
previous work on this fragment that has shown that the R3 bundle unfolds
at forces as low as 5 pN, which is below the resolution of this smAFM
apparatus.15 As with the other fragments,
the length of unfolding is less than the theoretical maximum length
of the amino acid chains (Supporting Information Table S1).

The R7–R8 fragment is different to the others
both in structure
and in the unfolding pattern that it generates. In all traces only
a single unfolding event occurs, despite the presence of two bundles.
Additionally the unfolding length of 104 ± 7 nm is much greater
than the potential unfolded length of either individual bundle (Supporting Information Table S1). This indicates
that a single dissociation event results in both bundles unravelling.
This notion is supported by the structural work on this fragment which
demonstrated that the R8 bundle is much weaker than the R7 and stabilized
by its insertion between the third and fourth helices of R7.5 It can therefore be surmised that once the R7
bundle is ruptured and begins to unravel, the instability of the R8
bundle allows it to be unravelled without a second dissociation event.

Talin Rod Bundles Dissociate over a Range of Forces
As well
as illuminating the pattern of fragment unfolding, the force
extension data can be analyzed to determine the force associated with
each unfolding event. These forces were combined into histograms that
demonstrate the range of forces involved (Figure 3a–e). The unfolding of all talin rod
fragments seems to occur over a range of forces between 10 and 40
pN. Within that range, individual unfolding events seem to occur at
specific forces, indicating that different bundles may exhibit different
levels of mechanical stability (Supporting Table S1). This indicates that talin may consist of mechanical elements
with a range of mechanical stabilities, such as has been proposed
previously for fibronectin.25 We therefore
performed further analyses to dissect the mechanical characteristics
of the talin rod components.

SMD and AFM Analysis Reveal Hierarchy of
Bundle Stability
Constant velocity end-to-end pulling simulations
at 0.1 nm/ns and
2 nm/ns revealed that all tested talin rod domains unfold over a range
of forces (Figure 4). The constant velocity simulations at 2 nm/ns allowed us to obtain
a comprehensive picture of the unfolding pathway within 20 ns simulation.
Three simulations were performed for each of the bundles to ensure
the reproducibility of the traces obtained (Supporting Information Figure S3). Simulations at 0.1 nm/ns focused on
the initial breaking of the domains over approximately 40 ns. This
lower velocity pulling was used to test the method sensitivity and
the impact of the velocity on the final force magnitude, rather than
for a comparison of trajectories. Overall, similar patterns of unfolding
force magnitude were observed for both tested velocities. The pulling
rates used for these simulations were much greater than physiological,
with the expectation that pulling at speeds closer to those expected in vivo would result in dramatically lower forces, as revealed
by the smAFM measurements.

domains in SMD. (a–c)

velocity pulling at 0.1 nm/ns. Gray lines visualize the force magnitude
for all bundles. The tested rod domains show varying mechanical stability
represented by different unfolding force magnitude. All rod domains
are classified into three groups which are color highlighted in separate
plots against the complete data set. (a, d) Weak class (orange) contains
R3, R4, R6, and R10 bundles unfolding under maximum unfolding force
500pN; (b, e) intermediate class (blue) contains bundles R7, R11,
and R12 unfolding between 500 and 1000pN; (c, f) strong class (green)
with R5 and R9 bundles with unfolding force over 1000 pN. Similar
classification was observed for both simulation settings at 0.1 nm/ns
and 2 nm/ns velocity.

Due to the character of the simulations, calculated unfolding
forces
from SMD are only relative and cannot be directly compared to the
experimental unfolding forces. Despite the large differences in force
magnitude, the unfolding trajectories illustrate very similar unfolding
dynamics over the tested domains (Figure 5). Moreover, small differences in structural
changes result in large changes in the calculated force magnitude.
Hence, SMD unfolding force is used here only for pattern analysis
and talin rod domain stability classification, but not for providing
predictions for the absolute unfolding force. This is a similar approach
to that presented in the work by Craig et al. concerning
the stability of fibronectin Ig domains.25 It is also good to keep in mind that the cellular processes may
happen in the time frame of milliseconds to hours, not reachable by
all-atom simulations.

Structure
snaps were captured at 0, 5, 10, and 15 ns of the constant velocity
pulling at 2 nm/ns. The three stability groups (weak, orange; intermediate,
blue; strong, green) show mild yet distinct differences in the domain
unfolding. Fully unfolded helices are cut away and presented by dashed
line with a helix identifier.

Based on the relative force magnitude and unfolding trajectories,
we have classified the tested talin α helix bundles into three
stability groups: weak, intermediate, and strong. The weak class contains
the easily unfolding four-helix bundles R3 and R4. The R3 bundle contains
a belt of polar residues in its hydrophobic core unique among the
talin rod bundles. This polar pattern may cause R3 destabilization
and unfolding under low mechanical load. Previous studies showed that
replacement of the polar belt residues by hydrophobic amino acids
increased the mechanical stability of R3.15,16 Bundle R4 also unfolded gradually without noticeable resistance
in SMD. In all three 2 nm/ns simulations, the helicity in H2 (Ala960
– Pro964) and H3 (Pro996 – Met1000) of R4 was greatly
disturbed by twisting and bending. This effect was observed during
pulling simulations, however the areas were not affected by the mechanical
force directly. Interestingly, such proline occurrence is rather uncommon
across other talin helices. Furthermore, both proline residues are
highly conserved between species for both talin-1 and talin-2, as
determined by multiple sequence alignment (Supporting Information Table S2). The weak class additionally contains
two five-helix bundles, R6 and R10, which unfold under low force in
SMD. Both R6 and R10 bundles have helix H1 considerably shorter compared
to other bundle helices. This may contribute to the lower domain mechanostability.
The short H1 was separated in both domains early in the simulation
followed by gradual unfolding of H5 at the C terminal end. In both
cases we have observed a 3-helix intermediate (H2–H4) stable
between approximately 8 and 11 ns for R6 and approximately 9 and 12
ns for R10 (Figure 5). Whether this intermediate represents a functionally important
state remains unclear.

The intermediate class contains domains
R7, R11, and R12 with domain
R7 fluctuating at the border of the soft and intermediate classes
during the first 9 ns of 2 nm/ns simulation. All domains in this class
consist of five-helix bundles where all the helices have similar lengths.
In the R11 bundle, the highly conserved residue Met2121 in H5 (the
long connecting helix between R11 and R12) was identified as a possible
gatekeeper in all three simulations. Met2121 is located in the IBS2-A
region26 with its hydrophobic side-chain
pointing toward the hydrophobic core of R11. It creates nonpolar contacts
with H2 and H4 and possibly contributes to the stability of the bundle
and thus maintains the IBS2-A. Similarly to unfolding trajectories
of R6 and R10, we have observed possible 3-helix intermediates consisting
of H2–H4 core also in R11 and R12 simulations (Figure 5).

Finally, the strong
group contains domains R5 and R9. Both of these
two bundles are five-helix domains with similar helix lengths. Furthermore,
in strong bundles, additional characteristic twisting of the helices
around the bundle axis was observed in structural alignments when
compared to the bundles of intermediate class. (Supporting Information Figure S2b). Greater displacement of
helix ends at the bundle top and bottom was observed for R9 bundle,
which also exhibits the greatest mechanical stability. On the other
hand the smallest differences between the top and bottom helix positions
can be seen for bundle R11 which is the softest of the presented bundles
(R5, R9, R11, R12). Such specific twisting of the bundle is likely
to increase the contact areas between its helices and increase the
unfolding force demand.

To further investigate the differences
of the strong (R9) and intermediate
(R11) bundles, we performed individual helix alignment against an
ideal α-helix. We observed that the helicity between the two
bundles is affected. The average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
of atomic positions of structural alignments was 1.810 Å for
R9 and 1.599 Å for R11, suggesting that α-helices of R9
bundles are more deformed compared to R11 helices. We identified two
residues which may be important for the R9 bundle stability, namely
Leu1668 in H1 and Met1803 in H5. These highly conserved residues create
large hydrophobic contacts with the core of R9. Furthermore, the Met1803
residue is located in close proximity to the R9-R8 interface as well
as the interface between R9 and the talin head subdomain, F3, and
may contribute to the stability of the autoinhibition conformation.27,28

The AFM force data support this proposed hierarchy of bundle
stabilities.
Based on the SMD classification, R4–R6 contain two bundles
from the weak group, R4 and R6, and one strong bundle, R5. By AFM,
we see two unfolding events occurring at a lower force (<20 pN)
with one event at a higher force (>20 pN), well in agreement with
the SMD (Figure 3b).
In case of R9-R10, SMD proposes one weak bundle and one strong, and
indeed, AFM demonstrates one lower force unfolding event and one with
a higher force (Figure 3d). Finally, in the R11–R12 consisting of two bundles of intermediate
strength according to SMD, both unfolding events seem to occur at
a similar force regime (Figure 3e). Thus, there is excellent agreement between the mechanical
stabilities derived from the bundle structures and those observed
experimentally.

Discussion
The strong links between
talin and a cell’s mechanosensitivity
have highlighted the need for a thorough understanding of its force
response. Single-molecule studies focusing on the R1–R3 region
of the rod have demonstrated the basic mechanisms of this mechanosensitivity.
It has been shown that unfolding of this region can occur at forces
as low as 5 pN and that this unfolding leads to an increase in affinity
for vinculin.13,15 Despite the comparative lack
of previous molecular investigations on the remainder of the rod,
cellular studies have indicated that the regions R4–R12 may
be actively involved in talin’s mechanosensing. A study that
measured the distance between talin’s N- and C-termini showed
that this length varied between 50 and 350 nm.29 This increase in length would require the unfolding of
more than just the R1–R3 region, as this region alone could
only contribute up to 150 nm of added length. Additionally, super-resolution
microscopy of focal adhesions has shown that vinculin binding occurs
along the full rod, including R4–R13,30 and this indicates that the cryptic VBSs of the full rod are being
revealed through structural rearrangement. It is thus important to
fully understand the mechanical hierarchy of the talin rod substructures
in order to enable further studies to better understand the physiological
and pathological role of talin.

Here we have shown that the
bundles R4–R12 are vulnerable
to mechanically induced structural rearrangement comparable to R1–R3.
The application of force to these bundles results in characteristic
unfolding events; these events are followed by extension that suggests
substantial unfolding of the helical bundle structures. The unfolding
of these additional bundles explains how the N–C terminal length
varies in cells and also provides a mechanism by which the cryptic
binding sites in these bundles become activated. Our data and techniques
may be used in the future to design talin mutants of varying mechanical
stability in order to evaluate the contribution of talin-mediated
mechanosensing in cellular differentiation or developmental biology
processes.

In order to fully appreciate talin’s role
in cellular mechanotransduction,
we have highlighted that force-induced structural rearrangement occurs
in the whole rod domain. Crucially this occurs within a physiological
force range. Recent advances in combined single-molecule cellular
studies have revealed the forces acting on talin and other focal adhesion
proteins. Single integrin molecules have been shown to experience
forces up to 40 pN in magnitude. Additionally cells require this level
of tension to be applied to integrins in early adhesion formation
in order for the cells to adhere correctly.31,32 When tension sensors were inserted into the talin molecule itself
it was shown that the majority of talin molecules experience tension
>7 pN with a proportion experiencing >10 pN.9 In light of this cellular data, it is interesting that
we see that
all bundles in the rod unfold at forces in the 15–30 pN range,
within the physiological range of forces applied to focal adhesions in vivo. Importantly, one may assume that the unfolding
force predicted by AFM is the upper limit needed for the unfolding in vitro, as the retraction rate used, 400 nm/s, was higher
than the accepted physiological actin retraction rate of 50–100
nm/s.33 For comparison, Yao et
al., when using magnetic tweezers with a loading rate of
5 pN/s, found that the stronger bundles in R1–R3 unfolded at
12 pN and 20 pN, which compares to 19 ± 3 pN and 25 ± 2
pN for our data.15 The loading or retraction
rate affects the force of an unfolding event, with lower rates resulting
in lower unfolding forces.34 Given that
our retraction rate is higher than physiological and the experiments
of Yao et al. were conducted at the lower end or
below physiological rates, it is likely that in vivo the unfolding forces of the talin bundles lie in the narrow range
between our values.

Within this physiological range, a hierarchy
of bundle stability
can be observed as demonstrated by both the SMD simulations and smAFM
unfolding. Stronger bundles unfold at consistently higher forces than
the weaker bundles. This means that the full talin rod possesses a
graduated response to force. Lower forces applied to the rod unfold
only the weakest bundles, and as the force increases, first the intermediate
and finally the strong bundles unfold, revealing or destroying appropriate
binding sites in the unfolded domains (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Cellular mechanotransduction as a result of
graduated talin rod
unfolding. Without force, the talin rod remains fully structured,
and no VBSs are available. Under low-force regimes, only the very
weakest bundle, R3, unfolds revealing its VBS. This activates one
vinculin molecule, releasing it from its autoinhibited state. As the
force applied to talin increases, more bundles are unfolded, revealing
more VBSs and thus activating an increasing number of vinculin molecules.
The helical bundles have been colored to reflect the mechanical hierarchy
shown in Figure 4.
This schematic represents a simplified version of vinculin-mediated
talin mechanosensitivity. The process in vivo is
likely to include additional binding partners and more complex modes
of force application and unfolding.

The presence of cryptic VBSs along the rod and vinculin’s
importance in regulating focal adhesion pathways means that talin’s
graduated force response could result in a similarly graduated cellular
response to force. Vinculin natively exists in an autoinhibited form
where its head interacts with the tail domain. The binding of talin’s
VBSs with vinculin breaks this autoinhibition and thus releases the
vinculin tail, which consequently interacts with actin and numerous
other focal adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins.35 Thus, increasing the force on talin could lead to greater
unfolding of bundles, increased activation of vinculin, and therefore
amplified vinculin-dependent downstream signaling.

This simple
framework for mechanotransduction outlined above ignores
the potential involvement of talin’s additional binding partners.
The bundles that we have investigated contain binding sites for numerous
structural and signaling proteins including, RIAM, synemin, and deleted
in liver cancer 1 (DLC1). RIAM assists in targeting talin to plasma
membranes, through its interaction with talin and Rap1.18 DLC1 is a potent tumor suppressor protein whose
action involves the down-regulation of RhoA activity and thus reduces
the contractility of cells.36 The binding
sites of these proteins overlap the locations of VBSs and thus are
thought to compete for binding.16,20 In the case of RIAM,
it is expected that the bundled helical structure favors RIAM binding,
whereas the disruption of the bundle leads to a greater affinity for
vinculin. Thus, the influence of a range of physiological forces on
talin’s structure may modulate switching between favoring different
binding partners to control cellular function. The binding to DLC1
and RIAM reduces contractility and increases the formation of lamellipodium,37,38 whereas the presence of vinculin is a hallmark of more stable, mature
adhesions. This process of mechanotransduction, through the exposure
or disruption of binding sites, may be only one of the methods by
which talin’s behavior is controlled by force. Recent work
in Drosophila development has shown the importance
how two talin molecules are orientated with respect to each other
when in its dimerized form.39 Crucially,
simulations have demonstrated that the orientation of the talin dimer,
as dictated by its N-terminal dimerization domain, is controlled by
the application of force.40 Thus, the ability
of talin to interpret forces and consequently direct cell behavior
may be occurring on multiple levels of structure.

The current
study communicates the role of α-helical proteins
in mechanosensing. It is worth noting that the vast majority of the
previous studies focusing on mechanostability of the proteins are
conducted using proteins mainly containing β-sheet secondary
structures. α-Helical proteins, however, may represent a highly
important class of mechanosensing proteins.41,42 Interestingly, twisting of the helical structures around the bundle
axis, similar to our description for the R9 bundle, can be observed
for other α-helical proteins with an important role in mechanobiology.
A broad variety of helical organization and degree of bundle twist
can be detected over many mechanotransducers and structural proteins,
such as spectrin, α-actinin, or nuclear lamin. However, the
role of such structural characteristics on the mechanostability is
yet to be fully determined. The unique properties of the α-helices
render some challenges in terms of the SMD. The helices stretch substantially
upon unfolding, and the interactions between helices are dictated
by entropy-mediated interactions, thus causing possible bias in the
relevance of the absolute force determined. However, despite these
limitations, we propose that SMD simulations are useful and reliable
for the determination of relative mechanical stabilities, especially
when used in conjunction with smAFM, a combination that has not been
provided previously. It may be possible to further develop the SMD
methodology to better serve the needs of α-helical protein research,
but this is out of the scope of the current study. It is also worth
noting that although the separation of the rod into fragments facilitated
the study of its biomechanical properties, it is possible that interactions
between bundles in separate fragments may alter their stability and
behavior under load. Future studies will be required to elucidate
the complete picture of the unfolding of the full-length talin rod
and precisely how this integrates with its role in mechanotransduction.

Conclusions
The combination of SMD and AFM single-molecule experiments provide
a valuable insight into the molecular behavior and biological mechanisms.
In this study, it has revealed the range of forces over which the
entire talin rod unfolds and the hierarchy of mechanical stability
that the different bundles exhibit. While the contribution of these
methods for biological predictions and clinical significance discovery
is indisputable, it is a simplified representation of the complex
biological system and does not take into account the other cellular
components and the close proximity of the lipid bilayer. However,
as compared to cellular experiments, the benefit is that we can exclude
the contribution of other factors and thus enable better testing systems
to be built using cell and animal models.

Based on the results
of our study, we hypothesize that talin acts
as a delicate force meter sensitive to a range of small mechanical
forces. Such fine mechanosensing could control the affinity switch
toward ligands triggering biochemical cascades that lead to strong
surface adhesion or active spreading and locomotion. Given that the
observed range of bundle stabilities depends on small structural differences,
we also propose that changes in the mechanical stability of the talin
rod bundles could be modulated by a small number of single-point mutations.
These alterations may lead to misinterpretation of the mechanical
impulse and an aberrant cellular response. Hypothetically, such false
interpretation could lead into pathological changes in cell differentiation
and tissue growth leading to disease development.43 Work by others has shown that talin expression is vital
for cell differentiation and embryogenesis.2,100 The effect of mutations on talin mechanostability and cellular behavior,
however, has yet to be demonstrated. In the light of this discussion,
it is clear that understanding the principles and mechanisms of talin-mediated
mechanotransduction may provide crucial insights into the biology
in health and in disease.

Methods
Generation
of Polyprotein Constructs
The talin fragment
polyprotein constructs, including flanking I27, were synthesized
and cloned in to pFN18a. The polyproteins were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RILP competent cells, using
the T7 promoter present in the plasmid. Protein expression was induced
with IPTG when the culture reached an OD600 nm of
0.6. Cells were lysed with lysozyme and sonication before being purified
with Ni-NTA beads in a batch process. The eluted proteins were analyzed
for purity with SDS-PAGE. Final concentration of protein used for
experiments was 1–10 μg/mL.

Preparation of Ligand-Functionalized
Surfaces
Glass
coverslips were functionalized with the chloroalkane ligand to HaloTag
as previously described.21 The glass coverslips
were first cleaned using Helmanex III (1% in water), acetone ,and
ethanol washes. The surfaces were then prepped with O2 plasma
cleaning for 15 min. Surfaces were then silanized using (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane,
diluted to 1% in ethanol. Surfaces were then washed with ethanol and
then dried with N2. These amine-functionalized surfaces
were then incubated with 10 mM succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)tetracosaethylene
glycol] ester (SMPEG24 – Thermo) diluted in 100 mM borax buffer
(pH 8.5) for 1 h. The final step involved incubating the surfaces
overnight with 10 mM HaloTag Thiol O4 ligand in the same buffer. The
surfaces were quenched with 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in water.

AFM Experiments
and Analysis
We used a commercial AFS-1
from Luigs & Neumann, GmbH, based on a device developed at the
Fernandez Lab, Columbia University.22 The
cantilevers used were gold-coated OBL-10 levers from Bruker. The spring
constants varied between 4 and 10 pN/nm as measured by equipartition
theorem with the appropriate adjustments for cantilever geometry.44,45 Around 20 μL of protein solution was incubated on functionalized
coverslips for 30 min prior to the experiments to allow for HaloTag
binding. The cantilever was pressed into the surface with a force
of ∼300 pN to bind the cantilever to the polyprotein. Force
extension experiments were conducted at 400 nm/s retraction rate.
Data analysis was carried out using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), where
the worm-like chain model was applied.

SMD Simulation
In SMD, all tested talin rod domains
were analyzed for mechanical stability separately with the exception
of R7. Bundle R7 was modeled together with inseparable R8 domain.
The following structures from RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) were
used for the models; R3 (id 2L7A residues 796–909), R4 (id 2LQG), R5 (id 2L7N), R6 (id 2L10), R7–R8 (id 2X0C), R9 (id 2KBB), R10 (id 2KVP), R11 (id 3DYJ residues 1975–2145),
R12 (id 3DYJ residues 2131–2291). Anchors and extra sequence parts used
for structure crystallization were removed from all analyzed models
in PyMOL ver.1.4.1.

SMD simulations were performed using Gromacs
ver 4.6.7 at the Sisu supercomputer, CSC, Finland.46,47 For each model, the CHARMM27 force field and explicit TIP3P water
model in 0.15 M KCL neutral solution were used. Pulling vector was
set between Cα of first and last residue of appropriate domain.
Consequently each structure was oriented according to the pulling
vector in z direction of the simulation box. Each
model was minimized to 100,000 steps and equilibrated for 1 ns. The
system equilibration was monitored by following the temperature, pressure,
and density parameters over time. The structure equilibration was
assessed by plotting the backbone RMSD value for each bundle subjected
to pulling throughout the equilibration, i.e., R8 was omitted from the analysis. For all bundles the
RMSD reached plateau within 0.8 ns of 1 ns equilibration. All equilibration
parameters were stabilized within 1 ns for all modeled structures.
Simulations were performed with constant velocity pulling at 0.1 nm/ns
(n = 1) and 2 nm/ns (n = 3). All
simulations were run at NPT conditions with Berendsen thermostat and
Berendsen barostat. Temperature control was set to 310 K, time constant
to 0.1 ps, pressure control to 1.0 bar, and compressibility to 4.5
× 10–5 bar. Temperature and pressure controls
were applied separately for protein and solution parts. Furthermore,
equilibration was performed at isotropic conditions while pulling
at semi-isotropic conditions where pressure control was turned off
in the pulling direction (z-axis). The conditions
used were validated by using extensive set of simulations. Spring
constant was set to 1000 kJ/mol nm.2

Force of the
spring was calculated according to F = kspring (xideal t + x0 – xt),
where k is the spring constant, xideal t is the ideal elongation with velocity
at time point, x0 is the pulling vector
length at time = 0, and xt is the pulling
vector length at time point. Resulting trajectories were analyzed
with VMD ver 1.9.1 at 100 ps time window.48 An average of 10 force values was presented to minimize fluctuation
and eliminate noise caused by low time step (2 fs) and sampling (1000)
setting for data collection and additional 5 window stride load setting
in VMD analysis.
