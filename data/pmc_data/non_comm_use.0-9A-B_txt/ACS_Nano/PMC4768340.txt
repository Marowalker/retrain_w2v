Alkali metal atoms are frequently
used for simple yet efficient
n-type doping of organic semiconductors and as an ingredient of the
recently discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon superconductors.
However, the incorporation of dopants from the gas phase into molecular
crystal structures needs to be controlled and well understood in order
to optimize the electronic properties (charge carrier density and
mobility) of the target material. Here, we report that potassium intercalation
into the pristine 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA)
monolayer domains on a Ag(111) substrate induces distinct stoichiometry-dependent
structural reordering processes, resulting in highly ordered and large
KxPTCDA domains. The emerging structures
are analyzed by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning
tunneling hydrogen microscopy (ST[H]M), and low-energy electron diffraction
as a function of the stoichiometry. The analysis of the measurements
is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These turn
out to be essential for a correct interpretation of the experimental
ST[H]M data. The epitaxy types for all intercalated stages are determined
as point-on-line. The K atoms adsorb in the vicinity of the oxygen
atoms of the PTCDA molecules, and their positions are determined with
sub-Ångström precision. This is a crucial prerequisite
for the prospective assessment of the electronic properties of such
composite films, as they depend rather sensitively on the mutual alignment
between donor atoms and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate
that only the combination of experimental and theoretical approaches
allows for an unambiguous explanation of the pronounced reordering
of KxPTCDA/Ag(111) upon changing the K
content.

Technologically
relevant electric
conductivities σ can be achieved through doping, which has become
a vital concept for efficient device architectures.1,2 Alkali
metals are frequently employed as electron donors due to their comparatively
small ionization energies and relatively straightforward processability.3−6 Molar doping ratios x (i.e., number
of dopants per host molecule) on the order of several percent already
lead to a substantial increase of σ.4 Higher ratios x have been shown to boost σ
by as much as 6 orders of magnitude, as demonstrated for the prototypical
dye molecule 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA,
C24H8O6, CAS registry no. 128-69-8)
intercalated with potassium.3 Since then,
the interaction of PTCDA with alkali metal atoms has attracted considerable
attention, particularly with regard to electronic and optical properties.7−14

The microscopic molecular structures formed during doping,
although
crucial for the understanding of the associated physical properties,
are not yet well established. Predominantly van der Waals bound molecular
crystals are prone to reordering processes upon intercalation with
atoms leading to new crystalline or amorphous phases.15−21 For doped molecular thin films in the monolayer regime the presence
of an interface with the substrate further increases the complexity
of the system by providing additional interaction channels and, thus,
possibly influencing the physical and electronic structures extensively.
The intercalation-induced modification of lattice parameters of thin
molecular films can be observed, e.g., with low-energy
electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).
However, the precise experimental determination of the dopant sites is rather challenging owing to the usually blurred
electronic contrast obtained in STM for adsorbates on metal surfaces.19,20

As a promising strategy to tackle this drawback, scanning
tunneling
hydrogen microscopy (STHM) introduced by Temirov et al. may be used.22 The application of this
technique goes well beyond STM by allowing small amounts of hydrogen
between the tunneling tip and the sample and subsequently driving
the tip–sample distance into the Pauli repulsive regime. Depending
on the scanning parameters one can attain a submolecular topographic
contrast reminiscent of the corresponding skeletal formula of the
compound.22,23 Nevertheless, with STHM a direct imaging
of guest atoms in a molecular host matrix is quite challenging and
has not yet been achieved, supposedly because imaging of the molecular
and atomic orbitals often requires different tunneling parameters.
So far, intercalated atoms were inferred only indirectly from the
visualization of bonding channels between molecule and dopant.24

In this paper, we adapt the STHM technique
to image simultaneously
PTCDA molecules and potassium atoms for KxPTCDA complexes of varying stoichiometries in monolayer domains on
a Ag(111) surface. This is realized by tuning the tunneling conditions
such that the recorded signal is close enough to the ideal STHM case
for highly resolved submolecular contrast of PTCDA but still contains
a sufficient contribution of the local electron density of states
to identify the K atoms as well. This then enables a detailed observation
of the unit cell composition. By controlling the amount of intercalated
potassium, distinct highly ordered and large domains of K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA complexes can be prepared. The epitaxial
relations of both intercalation concentrations are classified as point-on-line
(POL) with respect to the silver substrate, substantiated by means
of distortion-corrected quantitative LEED measurements. However, especially
for the K4PTCDA phase the ST[H]M images exhibit an ambiguous
feature which can only be understood correctly in combination with
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. With this interplay
between the complementary information acquired from LEED, ST[H]M,
and DFT, we gain comprehensive insight into the formed structures,
which is indispensable for future evaluations of the electronic properties
of alkali-metal intercalated interfaces.

Results and Discussion
First
K Intercalation Stage: K2PTCDA
As
a starting point for the structural investigations we prepared a pristine
PTCDA film on Ag(111), ca. 0.7 MLE (monolayer equivalent) thick, which
consists of highly ordered, densely packed molecular domains exhibiting
the well-known herringbone motif shown in Figure 1a,b.25−28 Part of the silver surface is deliberately left uncovered
to allow for possible structural rearrangements without forcing molecules
to adopt adsorption sites in the second layer. By depositing potassium
onto these monolayer domains of PTCDA/Ag(111), the herringbone structure
is converted into a new highly ordered self-organized phase, hereafter
named K2PTCDA according to the stoichiometry whose determination
is described in the following. Large domains of K2PTCDA
complexes exhibiting a rather low defect density can be observed.
Moreover, almost no molecules were found in the former herringbone
structure or in a disordered phase even without annealing the sample.
Hence, the structural transition from the pristine PTCDA herringbone
structure to a new highly ordered structure is spontaneous and affects
practically all molecular domains.

Figure 1 Self-assembled structures of distinct
KxPTCDA phases on Ag(111) for x = 0, 2, and 4. (a),
(b), and (c) show the STM image, structural model, and LEED image
of pristine PTCDA/Ag(111). STHM images associated with x = 2 (d) and x = 4 (g) exhibit features originating
from both K and PTCDA. Note that the determination of the unit cell
compositions, especially for x = 4, is not straightforward
and relies on the comparison with DFT calculations, discussed in the
text. The deduced structural models are depicted for x = 2 (e) and x = 4 (h). In each LEED image (c),
(f), and (i), the simulated reciprocal unit cell of the associated
KxPTCDA structure (x =
0 purple, x = 2 orange, and x =
4 blue) and the silver surface orientation along (01) and (10) (yellow)
are superimposed. All possible rotational and mirror domains are considered
for the simulation, and when taking multiple scattering into account
(open circles), all visible spots are consistent with the model and
none remain unidentified. The LEED image shown in (i) belongs to a
substrate area simultaneously exhibiting domains corresponding to x = 2 and x = 4. Displayed quantities: VT bias voltage; ISP tunneling current; E beam energy; a⃗1, a⃗2 adsorbate lattice
vectors; Γ = ∠(a⃗1,a⃗2) adsorbate unit cell angle; s⃗1, s⃗2 substrate lattice vectors with unit cell angle of ∠(s⃗1,s⃗2) = 120°; ϕ = ∠(s⃗1,a⃗1) domain angle; ξ(A/B) = (a⃗2,m⃗(A/B)) orientation
of molecules A and B in the unit cell.

By means of LEED (Figure 1f), we find a unit cell with significantly shorter
lattice
vectors (|a⃗1| and |a⃗2| decrease by 29.9% and 15.4%, respectively) and an increased
unit cell angle Γ as compared to the initial commensurate herringbone
structure (cf. Table 1). Further, the epitaxial relation is a point-on-line (POL) coincidence,
as can be inferred from the differences between the epitaxy matrix
elements in each row being integer numbers. This is equivalent to
a column of integer elements in the epitaxy matrix, provided that
∠(s⃗1,s⃗2) = 120° (as chosen here for the Ag(111) surface).29

ξ(A/B) determined from ST[H]M measurements. The average
area per molecule APTCDA is the unit cell area divided
by the number of molecules per unit cell. Experimental uncertainties
of the last significant digit are given in parentheses.

In order to obtain deeper insight
into the unit cell composition,
we acquired STHM images which simultaneously feature submolecular
resolution of PTCDA as well as clearly resolved potassium atoms. This
is hardly achievable in conventional STM mode (cf. Figure 1d and Figure 2a,c). Various samples and STHM conditions
were studied to avoid possible misinterpretations. According to these
tests, we can rule out experimental artifacts, such as features caused
by double tips.

Figure 2 Comparison of experimental STM and STHM images (a, c)
with a simulated
STM image (b) of the K2PTCDA phase. The main features originate
from the PTCDA molecules, while the K atoms cause small single dots
in STHM only. Note that in conventional STM (a) the features are smeared
out; PTCDA and K cannot be distinguished. The adsorbate unit cell
(orange boxes) comprising the structural model is superimposed in
a semitransparent manner. The applied tunneling parameters VT (bias voltage), ISP (tunneling current), and ρiso (isovalue of the
integrated density of states) are indicated.

The STHM image in Figure 1d reveals that the adsorbate unit cell of the K2PTCDA phase consists of only one PTCDA molecule and two potassium
atoms. Although the total unit-cell area decreases (vide supra), the net area per PTCDA molecule increases by 13.7% as there is
only one molecule per K2PTCDA surface unit cell compared
to two molecules for the herringbone arrangement of the pristine PTCDA
layer. The STHM image further shows that potassium is incorporated
in-plane into the molecular film close to the short edge of PTCDA.
Upon closer inspection, the potassium atoms are located near the oxygen
atoms and exhibit rather similar bonding distances to PTCDA as compared
to the calculated structure of free-standing K2PTCDA complexes.10 It has been shown that such a structure is a
consequence of an ionic bonding between the alkali metal and PTCDA
resulting in PTCDA dianion formation.8,11

By inspecting
domains of the K2PTCDA phase (cf. Figure 1d) with STHM, the
formed complex shows a characteristic stripelike assembly of alternating
rows of PTCDA and K, both oriented along the short lattice vector a⃗1, with the molecules oriented nearly
perpendicular to the stripe axis. The relative shift of molecules
in adjacent rows of PTCDA offers the densest packing and a coordination
maximum of the intercalated potassium toward the carboxylic groups.
One can view the situation as one-dimensional PTCDA stripes between
which rows of K atoms are intercalated (i.e., a reduced
dimensionality analogous to conventional intercalation of atoms between
2D extended layers).30 It is noteworthy
that the Ag(111) surface remains structurally unaltered upon K deposition.
This is fundamentally different from the situation encountered for
the Ag(110) surface, which was previously found to reconstruct significantly
when K is evaporated onto a predeposited PTCDA monolayer with subsequent
annealing.18 There the smaller packing
density of the Ag(110) surface (whose atoms retain a lower coordination
number) allows for an incorporation of K into the topmost silver layer,
resulting in a long-range “potassium-induced missing row reconstruction”.18 Since our experiments were performed without
post-growth annealing and revealed no surface reconstruction it is
unlikely that K diffused into the topmost densely packed Ag(111) atomic
layer. Instead, it was exclusively found intercalated in between PTCDA
molecules, i.e., neither underneath nor on top of
the molecular layer.

To further substantiate the proposed structural
model for the K2PTCDA phase on Ag(111), the experimentally
determined unit
cell and stoichiometry were used for DFT calculations. The geometry
of PTCDA and K within the unit cell was allowed to structurally relax.
Given that the epitaxy type of K2PTCDA is not commensurate
but point-on-line with respect to Ag(111), the silver unit cell had
to be slightly modified in order to achieve a geometry consistent
with periodic boundary conditions (i.e., a fully
commensurate arrangement), necessary for the calculations. In principle,
a quasi-commensurate structure with an all-integer epitaxy matrix
could also have been achieved by slightly modifying the unit cell
of the adsorbate, but we intentionally kept the experimentally determined
dimensions in order not to modify the distances between the K atoms
and PTCDA molecules. This is done bearing in mind the crucial role
played by the interactions between the K atoms and the carboxylic
and anhydride oxygen atoms. The necessary changes in the Ag surface
lattice constants were small (between 1.0% and 2.6%), and we ensured
that the resulting changes in the relaxation of the interlayer spacing
(on the order of 0.03 Å) and metal work-function (smaller than
0.04 eV) were negligible. For more details, see the Methods section and the Supporting Information.

Based on the optimized structure, we simulated STM images
using
the Tersoff–Hamann approach.31 This
provides a first approximation of STM images assuming an s-type tip
wave function, an aspect critically assessed in the Supporting Information. Based on the considerations presented
there and bearing in mind that for the tunneling conditions used here
the STHM images comprise sufficient contributions of the local electron
density of states (vide supra), a comparison of the
Tersoff–Hamann results with these images appears justified,
although for a full quantitative understanding of STHM higher angular
momentum contributions (for example p-type wave functions) can become
relevant as well.32

Indeed, when
comparing the simulation in Figure 2b with the experimental ST[H]M images in Figure 2a,c, distinct similarities
can be found. While the experimentally determined basis is clearly
reproduced by the calculations, the features corresponding to PTCDA
and K need to be discussed further: The simulated STM image reveals
that the strongest features stem from the C–C bonds near the
PTCDA anhydride groups. This might also be inferred from the experimental
STM image in Figure 2a; however, the experimental features are strongly broadened and,
consequently, the potassium atoms remain unresolved. In contrast,
most of the intramolecular details from the calculation are clearly
visible in the STHM image in Figure 2c, which supports the general assignment of the surface
unit cell. We observe distinct spotlike features stemming from the
in-plane incorporated potassium as well as features arising from PTCDA.
In comparable STHM experiments on a K0.5PTCDA phase on
Au(111) the K atoms were not resolved directly.24 The experimentally characterized K2PTCDA structure
(shown in Figure 1e)
fully agrees with the geometry-optimized structure obtained from DFT,
cf. Figure 2b. This
also implies that most likely no further potassium is situated underneath
or on top of the PTCDA layer. Furthermore, the DFT analysis shows
that upon K intercalation the oxygens of the functional groups of
PTCDA tend to bend away from the surface (see Supporting Information), an effect that has been observed
experimentally for K intercalated PTCDA on Ag(110) in a similar way.18 This is in stark contrast to the situation on
Ag(111) in the absence of K intercalation where the carboxylic oxygens
are bent toward the silver surface.33 In
passing, we note that the STHM contrast can be tuned to improve the
submolecular resolution of PTCDA even further, however, at the expense
of the visibility of K atoms in the same scan (more details, including
STHM images for various tunneling parameters, are included in the Supporting Information).

Another interesting
outcome of the simulations concerns the layer
formation energy of the K2PTCDA monolayer. It is defined
as the energy difference between the bound monolayer and the sum of
the contributions from the free metal surface and from the individual
constituents of the adsorbate layer (for a strict definition of the
quantity see the Methods). The binding energy
per molecule for the K2PTCDA phase is 11.61 eV, which is
significantly larger than for phases of PTCDA in the well-known herringbone
structure (4.01 eV per molecule) and for the K atoms far apart from
each other (2.49 eV per K atom), pointing to an energy gain due to
the intercalation, which amounts to 2.62 eV per PTCDA molecule. Such
a strong bonding between K atoms and PTCDA molecules in the monolayer
is consistent with the efficient formation of the ordered K2PTCDA phase even without annealing, as discussed above.

Second K Intercalation
Stage: K4PTCDA
By
further controlled evaporation of K, the former K2PTCDA
phase is converted into a second highly ordered intercalation stage
whose stoichiometry is unraveled only as an outcome of the combined
experimental and theoretical efforts detailed below. In anticipation
of the results and in order to avoid ambiguity in the terminology
used, this phase will be referred to as K4PTCDA. The transition
from K2PTCDA to K4PTCDA occurs directly, as
evidenced by our LEED investigations, which reveal no intermediate
structure. The corresponding STHM and LEED images are shown in panels
g and i of Figure 1. By means of ST[H]M, large domains of the K4PTCDA complexes
are observed. They generally also exhibit a low defect density, but
their structural perfection is slightly inferior to the K2PTCDA phase; i.e., the average domain size is smaller
and the number of defects appears somewhat increased.

The LEED
analysis reveals a significant change of the lattice parameters compared
to the former K2PTCDA phase. Both unit cell vectors increase
in length (|a⃗1| and |a⃗2| increase by 7.3% and 4.6%, respectively), while their
enclosed angle Γ decreases (cf. Table 1). The epitaxy matrix contains one column
of integer numbers; thus, a point-on-line coincidence can be stated
also in this case.29 Note that in LEED
experiments with average molar ratios x between 2
and 4, coexisting K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA phases
were often found on the same sample (cf. Figure 1i), indicating that on macroscopic scales
the layer is not necessarily uniform. Notably, the relative intensity
of the LEED spots associated with K4PTCDA could be successfully
increased at the expense of those associated with the K2PTCDA phase by additional potassium deposition.

In addition
to conventional STM, we acquired STHM images, cf. Figure 3, in order to elucidate
the unit cell composition in more detail. To optimize simultaneously
the contrast and to exclude possible experimental artifacts, a variety
of experimental conditions were also used here. However, determining
the stoichiometry from the contrast of the STHM alone (Figures 3c and 1g) is error-prone in this case, since between the molecular rows
five bright features per PTCDA molecule are perceived which exceeds
the estimated potassium content (see the Methods for details). Furthermore, the contrast of the STM image, showing
only one prominent feature in between the molecules, seems to be contradictory
to the STHM measurements. In this case, it is indeed indispensable
to compare the experimental data to optimized structures and simulated
STM images obtained from DFT calculations.

Figure 3 Comparison of experimental
STM and STHM images (a, c) with a simulated
STM image (b) of the K4PTCDA phase. The elongated features
in STM mode originate from the PTCDA molecules. In the STHM mode,
all K atoms are visible as sharp spots, while the bright blurred feature
from the simulated and experimental STM (highlighted by the outermost
dotted circle) remains visible as a “ghost feature”
(highlighted by the innermost dotted circle); see the text for details.
The unit cell of the adsorbate layer (blue boxes) comprising the structural
model is superimposed in a semitransparent manner. The nonequivalent
potassium positions KA and KB are marked. Explanations
of the displayed quantities are identical to those in Figure 2.

Therefore, we calculated STM images for a commensurate unit
cell
as close as possible to the experimentally determined one (see the Methods and the Supporting Information). This unit cell contained 2 PTCDA molecules and 6, 8, and 10 potassium
atoms, corresponding to the K3PTCDA, K4PTCDA,
and K5PTCDA composites. The optimization of a hypothetical
K5PTCDA results in a structure where some K atoms move
underneath the PTCDA, thereby tilting the molecules (see the Supporting Information for structure and simulated
STM picture). This clearly contradicts the experimental observation
of flat-lying molecules. The structurally optimized configuration
with three potassium atoms (see the Supporting Information) does not show the same symmetry as the experimental
data. In contrast, for K4PTCDA the calculated constant
current STM picture (Figure 3b) reproduces the experimental data very well (Figure 3a). Even specific details observed
in STHM are reproduced in the simulations, such as the inner structure
of PTCDA, where the most intense features can be related to C–C
bonds near the carboxylic oxygen atoms (as in the case of K2PTCDA). The most prominent feature localized in between four neighboring
PTCDA molecules visible in the experimental STM image has a rather
broad and blurred appearance. An almost identical feature at and in
between the actual K positions known from the structural optimization
(cf. insets in Figure 3) is seen in the STM simulation, which matches the experimental data
perfectly. A similar observation, where multiple adatoms are imaged
as a single feature in experimental and simulated scanning tunneling
topographies, was reported for Cu dimers in the template growth of
metal–organic chains on Cu(110).34

Considering that the Tersoff–Hamann-based STM simulations
originate from a calculation of the density of states between the
Fermi level (EF) and the energy corresponding
to the given tip bias, this means that there is a significant unoccupied
density of states in the region between the K atoms somewhat above
EF. This density of states can be traced back to a specific
state in a suitably charged K4 cluster, which is characterized
by a significant amplitude in the wave function right between the
K atoms. Assuming a charge transfer of approximately one electron
per K atom to the PTCDA layer and the Ag(111) substrate (see charge
transfer analysis in the Supporting Information), it is indeed possible to identify a state with the required properties
as the LUMO of a K44+ cluster. On the surface
this state is energetically broadened as a consequence of hybridization
with Ag states (a more detailed discussion of the LUMO of a charged
K4 cluster can be found in the Supporting Information).

Comparing the simulated and experimental
STM images to the STHM
image (Figure 3), notable
differences arise for the actual visibility of the K atoms. While
the four potassium atoms are individually resolved only in the STHM
image, a fifth bright “ghost feature” is simultaneously
visible in between the identified K positions, though significantly
more narrow and less intense than in the STM measurements and simulations.
This is attributed to the fact that for the chosen parameters the
contrast obtained by STHM is not purely topographic, but to a certain
extent also electronic (as evidenced by the nice agreement of the
submolecular contrast between experimental STHM and simulated STM
image discussed above). Consequently, the “ghost feature”
constitutes a remnant of the intense, blurred feature observed in
the genuine STM mode, and we emphasize that without the DFT calculations
it is easily mistaken for a fifth K atom.

Considering the energetics
of the different stoichiometries also
provides insight into the formation of the different phases: In the
calculations, we find that for an intermediate K concentration the
coexistence of the K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA phases
is energetically favorable over the formation of a K3PTCDA
phase. In particular, for the presence of an average of three potassium
atoms per PTCDA molecule on the surface having half of the surface
covered by a K2PTCDA layer and half by a K4PTCDA
layer is energetically favorable by 0.42 eV per PTCDA molecule over
a homogeneous K3PTCDA coverage. This is in excellent agreement
with the above-described experiments. In contrast, at higher K coverages
(four potassium atoms per PTCDA molecule), a homogeneous K4PTCDA layer is by 0.59 eV per molecule more stable than the coexistence
of K3PTCDA and K5PTCDA domains. All this points
toward the particular stability of K4PTCDA (a table reporting
all relevant energies is contained in the Supporting Information). In passing we note that the resulting electronic
structures of the intercalated K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA phases adsorbed on the Ag(111) substrate are described and
compared to pristine PTCDA/Ag(111) briefly in the Supporting Information.

Overall, the structure of the
adsorbate can be described by a monomolecular
unit cell that contains four potassium atoms per PTCDA, which justifies
the above designation of this structure as K4PTCDA. Compared
to the former K2PTCDA phase, the changed lattice parameters
imply an increase of the surface area per molecule of 18.3%, offering
the necessary space for the additional K atoms. The corresponding
structure exhibits a stripelike assembly of alternating K and PTCDA
rows oriented alongside a⃗1, similar
to the K2PTCDA phase but with some notable differences:
The formerly mentioned relative shift of adjacent rows of PTCDA along a⃗1 (by about half of its length) has
disappeared now. The molecules are arranged in an essentially rectangular
pattern and are almost parallel to the long lattice vector a⃗2. The STHM investigations reveal that
K again prefers the direct environment of the anhydride groups of
PTCDA, similar to the K2PTCDA phase. However, in the current
K4PTCDA case, not all K atoms attain equivalent positions
in the unit cell. In general, two nonequivalent positions of K with
respect to PTCDA are observable in STHM: the first (KA)
in between two molecules along a⃗2, near carboxylic and anhydride oxygen atoms; and the second (KB) in between two molecules along a⃗1, in the vicinity of carboxylic oxygen atoms only. Interestingly,
these positions bear resemblance to the K2PTCDA case, where
the K atoms have a carboxylic and an anhydride oxygen as nearest neighbors
in one of the adjacent PTCDA rows, while the nearest neighbor atoms
in the other row are only carboxylic oxygens. Furthermore, the DFT
analysis shows that again the oxygens of the functional groups of
PTCDA in the K4PTCDA phase tend to bend away from the surface
(briefly shown in the Supporting Information), similar to the K2PTCDA case.

Intriguingly, the
experimentally determined epitaxy types of K2PTCDA and
K4PTCDA are both point-on-line with respect
to the Ag(111) substrate, albeit with different registries. This means
that the adsorbate unit mesh is an integer multiple of the substrate
grid in only one dimension, while in the second dimension no such
coincidence of periodicities occurs. In fact commensurate supercells
would contain too many molecules to be physically meaningful.29 Consequently, all constituents of the corresponding
adlayers occupy in principle different adsorption sites on the substrate.
As a consequence one might expect local displacements of the adsorbed
entities in order to counterbalance unfavorable substrate sites. On
the other hand, even small (sub-Ångström) structural relaxations
will usually result in a sizable energy penalty originating from the
interactions within the adsorbate layer. While local displacements
of adatoms or molecules are not accounted for in our structural analysis
of the K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA phases, we cannot
completely exclude them either. In fact, especially the STHM contrast
of the potassium atoms in Figures 1g and 3c suggests that they
indeed relax structurally to a certain extent, though our experimental
resolution does not allow for a definitive statement here.

Finally,
we comment on an interesting feature observed when varying
the tunneling voltage in STM mode: As shown in Figure 4 the (blurred) feature associated with all
four K atoms becomes increasingly dominant when raising the tip bias
both in experiments as well as in simulations. This similarity between
experiments and simulations further supports the suggested assignment
of the structural details of the K4PTCDA layer. In essence,
the drastic increase in brightness of the K-induced feature as compared
to PTCDA can be related to two effects: First, a larger fraction of
the K44+ LUMO-derived feature in the density
of states comes to lie energetically between EF and the tip bias, when the latter is increased. Additionally,
it can be explained by the reduction of the local work function due
to the electron transfer from the K atoms to the surface.35,36 The latter effect is known to influence STM images.37,38 In our case, the effect is cooperatively enhanced at the center
of the K4 arrangement. Notice that while the increased
density of K atoms reduces the individual dipole moments, such a depolarization
effect is expected to play only a minor role here, as has been shown
for K in dense arrangement on Cu(001).39 Hence, the electronic states close to the potassium atoms extend
more strongly toward vacuum. In contrast, due to the electron accepting
character of PTCDA a local increase of the potential barrier can be
expected above the molecules. When the voltage is raised from 0.6
to 1.8 V, the tip moves farther from the surface to keep the current
constant. Consequently, the relative intensity of electronic states
above the potassium is enhanced. Only the detailed shape of the feature
stemming from the four K atoms, which becomes slightly elongated in
the direction perpendicular to the PTCDA rows in the experiments,
is not reproduced in the simulations and is not yet understood.

contrast of the experimental STM images
(a, b) compared to the simulated STM images (c, d). Each image comprises
a close-up inset for a direct comparison of features associated with
PTCDA and K. The unit cell of the adsorbate layer (blue boxes) comprising
the structural model is superimposed in a semitransparent manner.
Explanations of the displayed quantities are identical to those of Figure 2.

Further K Intercalation Stages
Exceeding
an effective
stoichiometry of four potassium atoms per molecule by continuing K
evaporation onto the pristine PTCDA/Ag(111) results in another highly
ordered Kx>4PTCDA phase. However, the
corresponding self-assembled structure tends to degrade at room temperature
within about 1 h (depending on the amount of molecules in the intercalated
phase), hampering ST[H]M experiments to determine structure and stoichiometry.
Furthermore, the decomposition occurs under reformation of the K4PTCDA phase, which is, therefore, assigned as the K intercalated
PTCDA phase exhibiting the highest potassium content with long-term
stability on the Ag(111) surface at room temperature (LEED images
showing the structure of the K4PTCDA phase and its degeneration
over time are attached in the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
By controlled potassium evaporation onto
pristine PTCDA monolayer
domains on Ag(111) (submonolayer coverage) we observed drastic changes
in the molecular arrangement resulting in structural reordering processes
of the K intercalated layers. Therefore, new KxPTCDA phases for x = 2 and 4 could be achieved
without the need of any additional annealing steps. By combining complementary
experiments (LEED, ST[H]M) and DFT-based modeling, we were able to
understand the atomistic details of the formed phases and their stability.

Our data clearly point to a rather strong interaction between K
and the PTCDA functional groups: First, the potassium atoms adsorbed
in between the molecules initiate the restructuring process of the
PTCDA molecules, leading to a complete conversion of the initial system
into the K2PTCDA phase. At higher K concentration, this
is then followed by a second transformation into the K4PTCDA phase. In both cases, (i) K claims similar adsorption positions
near the functional groups of PTCDA and (ii) the well-known commensurate
registry of the initially pristine PTCDA phase40 is lifted in favor of point-on-line (POL) coincidences
of the KxPTCDA phases and the Ag(111)
substrate.

Our results represent the crucial foundation to assess
the electronic
structure of such metal-intercalated organic films in greater detail
in a consecutive study, since the electronic structure is expected
to depend rather sensitively on the mutual alignment between molecules
and dopants.

Methods
All
experiments were carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum multichamber
system (base pressure in the 10–10 mbar region)
housing a dual microchannel plate MCP2-LEED from OCI Vacuum Microengineering
and an STM purchased from SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH.

The Ag(111) surface was prepared by multiple cycles of Ar+ sputtering (700 eV, 2 × 10–6 mbar, θ
= ± 45°) and annealing (700–800 K). Subsequently,
the PTCDA monolayer domains were deposited via thermal
evaporation at TPTCDA = 560 K (Sigma-Aldrich),
purified beforehand by temperature gradient sublimation.41 The evaporation temperature was stabilized within
ΔT = ± 1 K resulting in a constant molecular
flux. The evaporation time for a PTCDA submonolayer coverage of 0.7
MLE (monolayer equivalent, referring to a completely filled densely
packed monolayer) was determined by combined LEED and STM investigations.
To adjust the molar ratio x of potassium atoms with
respect to PTCDA molecules (see the Results) of the intercalated phases, K deposition from a commercially available
dispenser source (SAES Getters) was realized with a direct current
of I = 5.8 A for a given time. Estimations of the
relative potassium content difference between different samples are
based on the integrated deposition time assuming a constant flux of
K atoms. During all deposition experiments the sample was held at
room temperature.

Structural investigations were carried out
by means of LEED on
samples held at room temperature as well as at low temperatures (down
to TLEED ≈ 20 K) to ensure that
no thermally induced structural changes occur upon cooling. To achieve
quantitative LEED measurements the images were corrected regarding
distortions of the raw data, by applying a previously published algorithm,42,43 and subsequently analyzed using the software LEEDLab.44 All possible rotational and mirror domains were
considered, and multiple scattering effects were taken into account
during the analysis to further improve the accuracy. For quantitative
LEED measurements the lattice parameters of the Ag(111) substrate
surface |s⃗1| = |s⃗2| = 2.8894 Å45 and ∠(s⃗1,s⃗2) = 120° were used as a reference. The relative uncertainties
of the absolute values obtained by this procedure are less than 1%.

STM and STHM (TST[H]M ≈ 1.2
K) were carried out to investigate the unit cell composition in detail.
For STHM operation, the chamber housing the STM is exposed to hydrogen via a leak valve at p = 1 × 10–8 mbar for at least 45 min22 while scanning the sample with a very low bias voltage and hence
at rather small tip–sample distances. Due to the small cross
sections of the access windows in the cryogenic shields surrounding
the microscope, the precise hydrogen partial pressure in the proximity
of the sample is unknown but should be significantly lower than the
value given above. Successfully trapping hydrogen in between the tip
and the sample surface directly influences the tunneling junction
(more details on the STHM contrast are briefly mentioned in the Supporting Information),22−24,32 resulting in a spontaneous switching in contrast
(due to the sensitization of the tip). As this operation mode is unstable
for insufficient hydrogen pressure, the latter was adjusted until
stable STHM imaging was achieved. Afterward, varying the tunneling
parameters (tunneling voltage and current, changing the tip–sample
distance) allowed us to tune the resulting convolution of STM and
STHM contrast in a given image. Once the tip is sensitized the STHM
contrast can be emphasized by lowering the tip–sample distance
further (i.e., reducing the tunneling voltage) so
as to reach the Pauli repulsive regime. For higher bias voltages when
simultaneously moving the tip away from the surface, the STM contrast
of the sensitized tip becomes more pronounced and even the trapping
of hydrogen can be undone reversibly (allowing to perform STM and
STHM with the exactly same tip). Additionally, the imaging is not
only very sensitive to the tunneling parameters but also to the tip
condition in general (e.g., sharpness and stability).
For both STM and STHM measurements, the same KolibriSensor with a
tungsten tip from SPECS was used.

In the Results
and Discussion we show comparable,
but not identical, STHM images obtained under different conditions
in order to exclude experimental artifacts. The positions of K and
PTCDA within the unit cell were determined for several images so as
to avoid possible inconsistencies associated with specific contrasts.
This was mainly necessary for the K4PTCDA phase, but consistency
was also checked for the K2PTCDA phase.

The density
functional theory calculations were performed by applying
the repeated slab approach using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package
(VASP)46 in conjunction with GADGET.47 The Purdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
functional48 was applied together with
the vdWsurf method49,50 to account for long-range
van der Waals interactions. In all calculations, the substrate consisted
of five layers of atoms with the bottom three layers fixed during
all optimization runs. Off-Γ Monkhorst–Pack51 k-points grids of 5 × 3 × 1 for K2PTCDA and 3 × 3 × 1 for K4PTCDA were
used with a Methfessel–Paxton52 smearing
of 0.2 eV. Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials53 were used with a cutoff energy of 400 eV for the plane-wave
basis set. The STM images were simulated by integrating the local
density of states between the Fermi energy (EF) and the Fermi energy plus the applied tunneling bias (VT) following the Tersoff–Hamann approach.31 The integrated density of states (DOS) was then
averaged over more than 300 real-space grid points on the surface
of a hemispherical tip with a diameter of 2.0 Å.54 The z-coordinate of the apex of such a
model tip, for which the averaged DOS displays a given value (isovalue)
was plotted as a function of the lateral position (x,y) as a color map to reproduce the constant current
images. A critical assessment of the Tersoff–Hamann approach
for the present situation can be found in the Supporting Information.

When the adsorbate is modeled
using periodic boundary conditions,
a complication arises due to the point-on-line growth of the adsorbate.
To overcome this problem, we pursued the following approach: First,
the elements of the epitaxy matrices were either rounded to the nearest
integer (K2PTCDA) or first doubled in order to obtain close-to-integer
values and then rounded (K4PTCDA). In the latter case,
this would have resulted in a situation with 4 molecules in the unit
cell, thereby making the computation tedious. This could be avoided
by redefining a supercell being commensurate with the substrate containing
only two molecules, as described in the Supporting Information. Next, to ensure intermolecular and K-to-PTCDA
distances as in the experiments, while maintaining an epitaxy matrix
containing only integer elements, we rescaled the lattice constants
of the Ag(111) surface. The necessary (small) changes in the Ag(111)
lattice constants and the angles between the substrate unit-cell vectors
were different for the systems K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA. Different scaling factors along the two unit cell vector directions
also had to be applied. The resulting unit-cell dimensions are summarized
in the Supporting Information. We verified
that these modifications of the lattice have only negligible effects
on the electronic properties of Ag. In particular, the work functions
of the distorted Ag substrates are practically identical to the work
function of the pristine Ag substrate calculated using the optimized
PBE lattice constants (see the Supporting Information). Furthermore, the interlayer spacing of the Ag substrate is also
comparable.

Layer formation energies were calculated as the
differences in
total energy of the combined system (K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA on the Ag(111) slab) and the total energy of the isolated
constituents (i.e., Ag slab, PTCDA molecules, K atoms).
The geometries of the combined systems and their constituents were
optimized separately.
