We disclose a method
for the synthesis of chiral colloids from
spontaneously formed hollow sugar-surfactant microtubes with internally
confined mobile colloidal spheres. Key feature of our approach is
the grafting of colloid surfaces with photoresponsive coumarin moieties,
which allow for UV-induced, covalent clicking of colloids into permanent
chains, with morphologies set by the colloid-to-tube diameter ratio.
Subsequent dissolution of tube confinement yields aqueous suspensions
that comprise bulk quantities of a variety of linear chains, including
single helical chains of polystyrene colloids. These colloidal equivalents
of chiral (DNA) molecules are intended for microscopic study of chiral
dynamics on a single-particle level.

Among the
captivating consequences
of symmetry-breaking chirality is the coupling of rotational and translational
degrees of freedom manifested in the Baranova and Zel’dovich
propeller effect.1−4 Since it is not viable to visualize this intriguing coupling, and
other phenomena such as chiral liquid crystal formation, on a single-particle
level for chiral molecules, we set out to synthesize chiral colloids.
Colloids are similar to molecules in that they are sufficiently small
to exhibit Brownian motion in low-Reynolds number regime, but unlike
their molecular counterparts they are in situ observable
by optical microscopy.5,6

A drawback of reported synthesis
methods of chiral colloids is
the need for complex, anisotropic building blocks with directional
interactions. For example, colloidal helical structures that mimic
the DNA helix have been assembled from anisotropic magnetic colloids7 and amphiphilic Janus spheres.8 Furthermore, template-based (e.g., DNA) and lithographic
techniques are often employed.2,9−11 These methods have several downsides such as a low yield,2,9 fragile helical products prone to dissociation,8 clusters subsisting only in an external magnetic field,7 or the need for expensive chemicals and multiple
purification steps.10

Inspired by
a computational study of Pickett et al.,12 predicting that spheres can assemble into helical
chains upon cylindrical confinement, spherical particles have been
used as building blocks for complex structures.13,14 Yin and Xia,15 for example, experimentally
explored the preparation of helical chains from simple colloidal spheres
confined in V-grooves by capillary forces. However, the obtained structures
are immobile and produced in low yield with only a limited number
of particles available through slow and batch processes.

Here,
we report a synthetic strategy for chiral colloids that is
not limited to certain materials or particle properties and that does
not require DNA, anisotropic particle shapes or directional interactions.
Robust colloids have been prepared with a yield not attainable with
conventional (lithography) techniques. Our method exploits the coassembly
of microtubes and colloidal particles, developed in our group, to
synthesize helical, zigzag and zipper colloidal chains in bulk.16−18 To this end, we designed photoresponsive colloids that form covalent
bonds upon irradiation with UV-light inside the cylindrically confining
environment created by the microtubes. Upon removal of the template,
a variety in assemblies is obtained in aqueous suspension. The resulting
colloidal chains depend sensitively on the colloid-to-tube diameter
ratio.

Results
Coassembly of Colloids and Microtubes
Cyclodextrins
(CDs) are donutlike sugar molecules with a hydrophilic exterior and
a hydrophobic interior.19 In water, the
cavities of CDs can minimize undesirable interactions by incorporating
the hydrophobic tails of surfactants. Mixtures of β-cyclodextrin
(β-CD) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) thus form host–guest
inclusion complexes in a 2:1 molar ratio at temperatures above 40
°C in aqueous media. Upon cooling to room temperature these SDS@2β-CD
complexes self-assemble into multiple equally spaced curved bilayers
forming a set of concentric hollow cylinders.20 These cylinders are straight and rigid tubes that can be several
tens of micrometers long with a pore diameter of 0.9 μm ±
10%. On addition of colloidal spheres, the tubular structures act
as a cylindrically confining environment and ordered, chainlike colloid-in-tube
assemblies are obtained. As the microtubes form a space-filling structure,
all colloidal particles with a size smaller than the microtube diameter
appear confined in the tubes. Depending on the size ratio of the colloid-to-tube
diameters (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), various structures, including helical sphere chains, are formed;
three distinct size ratios were chosen for further investigation.

Photoresponsive Particles
Upon removal of the confinement,
the formed colloid-in-tube assemblies dissociate. To secure the morphology
of colloid structures prior to dissociation, we designed photoresponsive
polystyrene spheres for UV-induced cross-linking; see Figure 1. The desired sterically stabilized
photoactive colloids in water were obtained by utilizing surface-initiated
atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) to graft well-defined
hydrophilic polymeric hairs from the surface of polystyrene spheres.21,22 The ATRP reaction was quenched to obtain polymer brushes of desired
length (≈30 nm), end-functionalized with bromine atoms. These
halogen atoms could then be substituted with azides to which alkyne-coumarin23−26 molecules could be attached via the efficient and robust click chemistry
pathway27 (see Figure 2).

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the assembly of
spheres into chains.
Photoresponsive colloidal spheres are confined in (thermoreversible)
microtubes that are composed of bilayers of SDS and β-CD after
a heating/cooling cycle. Due to geometric restrictions, the colloids
assemble in a variety of structures, including helical sphere chains,
for a colloid-to-tube diameter ratio of about 0.5. Upon irradiation
with UV-light, the colloids are covalently bound together inside the
microtubes. By diluting the system with water, the microtubes dissolve
and stable colloidal structures, including chiral chains, in bulk
are obtained.

the synthesis route toward photoresponsive
colloidal particles. (I) Seeded emulsion polymerization of cross-linked
polystyrene particles in the presence of 2-(2-bromoisobutyryloxy)ethyl
acrylate (BIEA), styrene (St), and divinylbenzene (DVB). (II) Polymeric

ends of p(HEA) are substituted by azides via a nucleophilic substitution

via the Huisgen click reaction.

Having successfully synthesized photo-cross-linkable colloids,
as characterized with infrared spectroscopy (see Figure S2), dynamic light scattering, and microscopy techniques,
the behavior in bulk was investigated. Covalent bonds between neighboring
colloids were evidently formed, as the photoresponsive colloids clearly
showed the expected photoinduced aggregation in bulk (see Supporting Information). The assembly into chiral
structures was subsequently studied.

Assembly into Sphere Chains
Polystyrene spheres with
surface-immobilized coumarin derivatives were assembled inside the
microtubes with a particle loading of 10 wt %. Upon irradiation of
the photoresponsive colloids inside the microtubes with UV-light with
a wavelength of 365 nm, coumarin molecules on adjacent particles photo-dimerized
and the colloid-in-tube assemblies were affixed. The cylindrical confinement
was subsequently removed by dilution of the system with water, causing
the microtubes to disassemble (see Figure 3). The obtained structures exhibit Brownian
motion (see Supporting Videos) and are
mechanically robust as the assemblies can withstand hours of exposure
to ultrasonication without disintegrating. Per synthesis cycle about
109 chains are obtained (see the Supporting Information for calculation of overall yield).

(b) Control sample that was enclosed in aluminum foil to prevent the
penetration of UV-light; no assemblies are formed. Scale bars are
10 μm.

Analysis of Formed Structures
The size ratio of the
colloid-to-tube diameters ultimately determines the structures that
can be formed. To investigate the effect of the size ratio on the
assemblies, we employed colloids of different sizes. Figure 4 shows the distribution of
structures that are obtained as a function of the colloid-to-tube
diameter size ratio. As the particle diameter approaches that of the
microtubes (colloid-to-tube diameter ratio of about one), a clear
preference for assembly in linear, rod-like chains is observed. Particles
that are much smaller than the microtube diameter, do not feel the
confinement and are thus randomly distributed throughout the cylindrical
tubes forming small and random aggregates. Conversely, particles that
are much larger than one micron cannot be incorporated inside the
tubes. The structures in bulk resulting from particles that have a
colloid-to-tube diameter ratio of about 0.5 vary from linear chains,
zigzag and zipper chains to helical assemblies; see Figure 5, Figure S7, and Supporting Videos. Typically,
a racemic mixture is formed and the chain lengths vary from 2 (dimers)
to 30 spheres per chain, with an average chain length of 10 spheres.
The average length of the chains can be varied by changing the weight
percentage of particles inside the microtubes. An increase in the
particle concentration leads to an increase in the number of spheres
per chain, but the length is ultimately limited by the extent of the
tubes, typically in the range of tens of microns.

cluster of a certain shape. Distribution
of linear, zigzag, zipper, and helical chains as a function of the
colloid-to-tube diameter size ratio. The percentages were determined
by counting at least 100 assemblies per size ratio as found in representative
microscopy images.

Discussion
By utilizing microtubes
and photoresponsive polystyrene spheres,
freely dispersed complex structures in bulk are obtained. As microtubes
tend to be sensitive to changes in concentration, pH, and ionic strength,
among others, we developed photoresponsive colloids since light is
an external and nondisruptive trigger toward the confinement. The
advantage of employing coumarin as the photoresponsive glue is that
no photoinitiator was required. However, coumarin is hydrophobic and
grafting densities had to be kept to a minimum to safeguard colloidal
stability and to prevent intraparticle coumarin cross-linking. On
the other hand, the surface number density of coumarin molecules had
to be sufficiently high to induce colloid attachment.

A wide
range of structures is produced for a colloid-to-tube diameter
ratio of about 0.5. According to theory, the yield of each species
and the pitch of the chiral chains could be controlled by fine-tuning
the ratio of the colloid-to-tube diameters.12 As a consequence of the inherent polydispersity in particle size
and microtube diameter, however, it is difficult to fall within these
narrow ranges experimentally. Therefore, postsynthesis separation
techniques were explored. Established chiral separation methods for
molecules, such as chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, are
not suitable for colloidal particles as they utilize chirality specific
chemical interactions.28 We employed density
gradient centrifugation (DGC) to successfully separate small clusters
and single particles from the desired chains. Unfortunately, DGC cannot
distinguish between a linear or helical chain composed of 10 spheres.
Our chiral colloids might be isolated in a helical flow flied; Aristov et al. demonstrated the separation of left- and right-handed
micron-sized chiral particles in a helical fluid flow inside a microfluidic
device.29

Since the colloidal assemblies
show variations in size, geometry,
and type of enantiomers, they are ideal for single-particle studies
of the dynamics and Brownian motion of colloids with chiral and other
geometries, which is currently ongoing work. Furthermore, preliminary
results have shown that the synthesis procedure as outlined in this
Article is not limited by the chemical nature of the colloids. Photoresponsive
silica spheres have been prepared in a similar fashion yielding colloidal
silica assemblies. By using metallic functionalization, chiral plasmonic
properties can be achieved for the fabrication of optically active
media.30 In addition, our wet synthesis
method can easily be performed on larger scales further increasing
the yield. Finally, the chiral structure of the microtubes, as a result
of the constituent chiral cyclodextrin molecules, could be exploited
to synthesize homochiral chains. However, the chiral coupling is currently
too weak to influence the confined colloids. If the chirality on the
nanoscale could be enhanced, this might lead to homochiral chains
but this is a topic for future research.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a synthesis method to produce
robust colloidal assemblies, including chiral colloids, in high yield.
Employing the coassembly of colloidal particles and microtubes, colloidal
helices can be assembled from spherical building blocks. Our synthesis
route yields photo-cross-linkable colloidal polystyrene spheres that
are sterically stabilized with polymer hairs and end-functionalized
with coumarin molecules. By exposure to UV-light, the coumarin molecules
act as a chemical glue holding the spheres in place even after dissolution
of confining tubes. Eventually, a library of ordered structures, such
as linear chiral assemblies, zigzag, and zipper configurations of
isotropic colloidal spheres, has become available in bulk. These colloidal
analogues of chiral molecules are a promising model system to study
the role of chirality in the self-assembly and the diffusion of biological
macromolecules, such as the DNA helix. Further insight into the functionality
of chirality on the molecular scale could aid in the design of chiral
materials.

Synthesis of 2-(2-Bromoisobutyryloxy)ethyl
Acrylate (BIEA)
The synthesis of BIEA was adapted from ref (31). A solution of HEA (40
mL, 348 mmol) and pyridine (31 mL, 383 mmol) in DCM (250 mL) was stirred
and cooled in an ice bath. Under nitrogen atmosphere, a solution of
BiBB (36.45 mL, 348 mmol) in DCM (50 mL) was added dropwise over the
course of 1 h. During the addition, a white precipitate was formed
(HBr-pyridine). After complete addition of the BiBB solution, the
reaction mixture was stirred an additional 3 h at room temperature.
The precipitate was filtered off, and DCM was evaporated under reduced
pressure. A yellow oil and additional precipitate was formed. The
additional precipitate was filtered off and washed with DCM. The DCM
from washing and the yellow oil were combined and washed with water
(three times, 50 mL per washing step). The oil phase was dried over
Na2SO4, and finally the DCM was evaporated under
reduced pressure. The resulting yellow oil was distilled to complete
the purification procedure yielding a colorless oil. 1H
NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 6.43 (d, 1H), 6.14 (dd,
1H), 5.85 (d, 1H), 4.4 (s, 4H), 1.9 (s, 6H).

Synthesis of Brominated
Colloidal Initiators (CPs-Br)
Cross-linked polystyrene particles
(CPs) were synthesized using a
standard emulsion polymerization method described in literature.32,33 A 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped with magnetic stir bar was
placed in an oil bath at 80 °C. Water (100 mL) was charged into
the reactor and allowed to reach the bath temperature. St (11.6 mL,
100 mmol), DVB (0.35 g, 2.4 mmol), and SDS (62.5 mg, 0.2 mmol) dissolved
in water (25 mL) were added. The complete mixture was allowed to heat
up to the temperature of the bath. Finally, the addition of KPS (0.39
g, 1.4 mmol dissolved in 18.8 mL water) initiated the polymerization.
The reaction was allowed to continue for 24 h at 80 °C. The resulting
latex had a solid content of 6.7% (measured gravimetrically). The
obtained particles had a diameter of 386 nm with a polydispersity
of 6.7% as determined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements revealed an apparent hydrodynamic
diameter of 406 nm with a corresponding polydispersity index (PDI)
of 0.036.

The synthesized particles were used as seeds in the
second step, in which BIEA was polymerized onto the surface of the
prepared CPs particles.22 To this end,
crude seed dispersion (CPs, 12.5 mL) and water (12.5 mL) were introduced
into a 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar.
The dispersion was degassed with nitrogen for 30 min. Subsequently,
a mixture consisting of St (0.5 mL, 4.4 mmol), DVB (10 μL, 0.07
mmol), and BIEA (0.4 g, 1.5 mmol) was injected under inert atmosphere.
After 5 min of stirring, polymerization of the newly added monomers
was initiated by the addition of a degassed, aqueous KPS solution
(16 mg, 0.06 mmol in 2.5 mL water). The polymerization was allowed
to run for 6 h at 70 °C after which the reaction was quenched
by removing the flask from the oil bath. The particles were washed
with water three times by means of centrifugation and redispersion
cycles.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used to confirm successful
coupling
of BIEA to the surface of the polystyrene particles (see Figure S2; 1732 cm–1, C=O
vibration of BIEA). DLS gave an apparent hydrodynamic diameter of
464 nm and a PDI of 0.095.

Grafting of Poly(HEA) Brushes from CPs-Br
Using SI-ATRP (CPs-p(HEA)-Br)
Cu(I)Br (6.9 mg, 0.05 mmol)
and HEA (69 μL, 0.60 mmol) were
mixed with MeOH/H2O mixture (7:3, v/v) (0.5 mL) in an oven-dried
Schlenk flask, resulting in a light green mixture (note: the copper
bromide salt does not completely dissolve in the reaction medium).
The obtained mixture was degassed by evacuation and refilling with
nitrogen (three cycles). Subsequently, PMDTA (29 μL, 0.14 mmol)
was injected, resulting in the appearance of a blue/green color and
complete solubilization of the copper bromide salt. The degassing
procedure was repeated once more to further exclude the presence of
oxygen in the obtained catalyst/monomer reaction mixture.

In
a separate Schlenk flask, the CPs-Br colloids dispersed in a 7:3 (v/v)
MeOH/H2O mixture (0.5 mL, 2 wt %) were degassed by evacuation
and refilling with nitrogen (three cycles). After degassing, the dispersion
was injected into the monomer/catalyst mixture under inert atmosphere.
The resulting reaction mixture had a white/green appearance. The ATRP
reaction was allowed to run for 40 min at room temperature, after
which the reaction was terminated by exposure to air, yielding an
intense blue color. The particles were washed three times with the
MeOH/H2O mixture, 10 times with a 50 mM aqueous NaHSO3 solution and finally three times with water. The NaHSO3 solution was used to facilitate the removal of the copper
catalyst. After the complete washing procedure, a stable colloidal
dispersion with a solid content of 1% was obtained.

The presence
of p(HEA) was probed using IR spectroscopy (see Figure S2; 1732 cm–1, C=O
vibration of pending ester functionalities of grafted polymers). Furthermore,
DLS showed a clear increase in apparent hydrodynamic diameter (529
nm), providing additional evidence for successful polymer grafting.

Nucleophilic Substitution of Halogen Chain Ends of Grafted p(HEA)
Hairs with Sodium Azide (CPs-p(HEA)-N3)
NaN3 (4.5 mg, 0.07 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL). To this
solution, a dispersion containing the p(HEA) grafted colloids in DMF
was added (0.5 mL, solid content = 1%). The obtained reaction mixture
was allowed to stir for 24 h at 70 °C. After this period, the
particles were washed with DMF (three times) and water (three times)
to remove excess NaN3. IR spectroscopy was used to verify
successful formation of azido-end-functionalized polymers (see Figures S2; 2096 cm–1).

Synthesis
of 4-Methyl-7-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)-coumarin (Alkyne-Coumarin)
The synthesis was adapted from ref (34). 4-Methyl-7-hydroxy-coumarin (2.5 g, 14.3 mmol)
and K2CO3 (8.18 g, 59 mmol) were transferred
into a 100 mL Schlenk flask containing a magnetic stir bar. The flask
was subsequently evacuated and refilled with nitrogen gas three times.
A separate Schlenk flask containing dry DMF (stored over freshly regenerated
mole sieves of 4 Å) was evacuated and refilled with nitrogen
(three cycles). Subsequently, the dried DMF (40 mL) was transferred
to the flask containing coumarin and K2CO3 using
a tube, yielding a clear, yellow solution after stirring for 10 min.
While stirring, propargyl bromide (2.6 mL, 23.3 mmol) was injected
via a septum resulting in a slightly darker yellow reaction mixture.
Stirring was continued for 72 h at room temperature.

The obtained
product was purified by precipitation of the crude mixture into water
(100 mL). The solid was filtered and washed with water four times.
The resulting solid was dried under vacuum for 2 h at 40 °C and
recrystallized from methanol. The product was stored in the freezer. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.5 (m, 1H), 6.9
(m, 2H), 6.2 (d, 1H), 4.8 (d, 2H), 2.6 (t, 1H), 2.4 (d, 3H). FT-IR:
ν = 3300 cm–1 (diagnostic signal used to confirm
successful modification of coumarin precursor). UV–vis (ethanol):
λmax = 320 nm.

Coupling of Alkyne-Coumarin
to CPs-p(HEA)-N3 Using
Click Chemistry (CPs-p(HEA)-Coumarin)
Cu(PPh3)3Br (6.25 mg, 6.7 μmol) was introduced into a 10 mL round-bottom
flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. To this, DIPEA (13 μL,
75 μmol) and alkyne-coumarin (0.5 mL of a DMF stock solution,
concentration = 4.9 mg/mL, 23 mmol/mL) were added. Finally, a dispersion
containing CPs-p(HEA)-N3 in DMF (0.25 mL, solid content
= 1%) was injected. The reaction was allowed to run for 24 h under
gentle stirring at 70 °C. After this period, the colloids were
washed with DMF. IR spectroscopy was used to probe the effectiveness
of the coumarin coupling to the chain-ends of the grafted polymers
(see Figure S2; disappearance of the signal at 2096 cm–1, free azide vibration).

Coassembly of Colloids and Microtubes
SDS and β-CD
were weighed and mixed as to obtain a molar ratio of β-CD:SDS
of 2:1 and a total concentration of SDS and β-CD of 10 wt %
in water (typically 1.72 g or 1.5 mmol β-CD and 0.22 g or 0.8
mmol SDS in 17.5 g H2O). While being magnetically stirred,
the mixture was heated to 60 °C in an oil bath until a transparent
and isotropic solution was obtained. The microtubes were formed upon
cooling to room temperature; a turbid and viscous suspension is obtained.
The photoresponsive colloidal particles were incorporated inside the
microtubes by centrifuging aqueous colloidal dispersions and replacing
the supernatant by microtube suspension. Typically, the mixture of
colloids and microtubes contained 10 wt % colloidal particles. The
mixture was heated to approximately 60 °C to melt the microtubes,
sonicated and then vortexed to disperse the particles inside the microtubes.
Upon cooling to room temperature, the sample was gently rotated to
avoid sedimentation of the colloids.

Irradiation Experiments
A 14 W low-pressure mercury
lamp emitting UV-light with a wavelength of 365 nm was used to cross-link
the photoresponsive colloids. Samples consisting of colloids incorporated
inside microtubes in cuvettes were placed in a water bath to prevent
the temperature increasing above 40 °C; the melting temperature
of the microtubes. Typically, samples were irradiated for 24 h. Control
samples were enclosed in aluminum foil to prevent the penetration
of UV-light.

Characterization
IR spectra were
obtained using a PerkinElmer
FT-IR/FIR Frontier spectrometer in attenuated total reflectance (ATR)
mode. The measurements were carried out on powders (obtained by drying
the corresponding particle dispersion).

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) pictures were taken with a Philips Tecnai10 electron
microscope typically operating at 100 kV. Bright field images were
recorded using a SIS Megaview II CCD camera. The samples were prepared
by drying a drop of diluted aqueous particle dispersion on top of
polymer coated copper grids.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
pictures were taken with a FEI
XL30 FEG scanning electron microscope operating at 5–15 kV.
SEM samples were prepared by drying a drop of diluted aqueous particle
dispersion on top of polymer coated copper grids and sticking these
grids on a stub using a conductive carbon sticker, which was coated
with a platinum layer of typically 6 nm.

Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) was performed using a Malvern Zetasizer
Nano instrument using highly diluted aqueous dispersions at 25 °C.
The DLS measurements were taken in ten runs of 10–15 individual
measurements in backscatter mode (173°). The hydrodynamic particle
dimensions are reported as number-average diameters with their corresponding
polydispersity index (PDI).

1H NMR spectra were recorded
using a Varian MRF400 400
MHz NMR machine. CDCl3 was employed as solvent.

UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda-35
spectrophotometer from λ = 450 nm to λ = 250 nm with 1.0
nm intervals. Helma QS quartz cuvettes with a path length of 10 mm
were used. Sample concentrations were chosen such that the maximum
absorption remained below 2.5.

Optical microscopy images were
obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E
inverted microscope equipped with a Hamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 V2 digital
camera. A Nikon CFI Apo TIRF objective (100× magnification, N.A.
1.49) was used. Pictures were recorded in bright field mode. For fluorescence
microscopy, a Nikon Intensilight C-HGFI light source was used with
a TRITC filter cube.
