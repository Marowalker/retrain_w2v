Nanocorrals
with different size, shape, and orientation are created
on covalently modified highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces
using scanning probe nanolithography, i.e., nanoshaving. Alkylated diacetylene molecules undergo laterally
confined supramolecular self-assembly within these corrals. When nanoshaving
is performed in situ, at the liquid–solid
interface, the orientation of the supramolecular lamellae structure
is directionally influenced by the gradual graphite surface exposure.
Careful choice of the nanoshaving direction with respect to the substrate
symmetry axes promotes alignment of the supramolecular lamellae within
the corral. Self-assembly occurring inside corrals of different size
and shape reveals the importance of geometric and kinetic constraints
controlled by the nanoshaving process. Finally, seed-mediated crystallization
studies demonstrate confinement control over nucleation and growth
principles.

Supramolecular
self-assembly
on surfaces is an active area of research aimed toward the realization
of a range of (functional) two-dimensional (2D) crystals.1−4 Control over the network morphology and defect density is a necessity
for precise engineering of these materials. Formation of high-quality
interfaces is important for engineering organic thin-film devices
with π-conjugated molecules, where the relative orientation
of molecules is crucial to enable efficient charge transport across
electrodes.5,6 Great efforts are taken to improve the quality
of 2D crystals,7−9 by avoiding molecular defects and limiting domain
boundaries. A host of variables are available to achieve this, either
intrinsically (molecular design and symmetry)10 or extrinsically (temperature,11,12 solute concentration,13 type of solvent,14,15 capillary
flow,16 and substrate).17 Despite the tunability of these parameters, the time scales
and complexity of molecular recognition and assembly processes have
thus far limited a complete comprehension and control of the 2D crystal
formation. As such, studies targeting the fundamental understanding
of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters within these systems are rare.11,18−20 An ability to manipulate nucleation and growth processes
would afford greater control over network formation and possibly a
more detailed molecular level understanding of assembly principles.

One approach to study the elementary aspects of self-assembly consists
of compartmentalizing the assembling molecules into laterally confined
areas. Beebe etal. demonstrated
that by heating highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in the presence
of oxygen, thermally oxidized pits can be etched into the surface.21 These pits were proven to be useful tools for
molecular self-assembly confinement studies; however their preparation
methods limit control over the shape, dimensionality, or orientation
with respect to the symmetry axes of the underlying substrate lattice.22,23 Other studies within confined spaces have been reported by de Oteyza etal., who showed that under ultra-high-vacuum
conditions, self-assembly of diindenoperylene on Cu (111) step edges
leads to the formation of a long-range ordered structure with co-directionally
oriented molecules.24 Alignment is observed
along the confined step edges of the Ag (877) vicinal surface for
terminal alkyne-functionalized polyphenylene building blocks.25 Studies targeting confinement at very small
length scales500 (a few nanometers) have
demonstrated the role of electronic surface states using well-organized
adsorbates.26−28 Nevertheless, alternative approaches that yield well-defined
corrals for studying molecular self-assembly under nanoconfinement
may afford greater insight into the fundamentals of recognition and
growth processes.

In this work, we create confined spaces (nanocorrals)
with geometric
size, shape, and orientational control on covalently modified HOPG
surfaces. Corral production involves two separate steps. First, HOPG
is covalently modified by aryl radicals that are electrochemically
(EC) generated from an aryl diazonium precursor species (Figure 1a).29−600 In the second step, the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
is used to precisely remove the covalently bound species from the
surface, a process that is referred to as “nanoshaving”
(Figure 1b). Subsequent
self-assembly investigations (Figure 1c) within these well-defined nanocorrals are carried
out at the liquid–solid interface using a saturated solution
of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) in 1-phenyloctane (1-PO). The
PCDA molecule contains typical structural and functional features
such as alkyl chains and a carboxylic acid headgroup that are known
to foster supramolecular self-assembly at the liquid–solid
interface on graphite.34−37

Previous work involving the STM tip-mediated removal of a
physisorbed
self-assembled network containing porphyrin derivatives on HOPG has
been reported by Hipps etal.33 Local areas of bare graphite were obtained,
however diffusion is believed to result in poorly defined structures.
In contrast, the covalent linkage of aryls to the graphite surface
as presented here creates a rigid platform for the formation of nanocorral
patterns. Due to the localized nature of the probe and the rigidity
of the grafted molecules on the surface, this nanoshaving process
has the potential to create dimensionally controlled, stable corrals
down to a 10 × 10 nm2 scale.

of the covalent modification of the HOPG
surface, nanoshaving performed by the STM tip (ex situ and in situ) to generate the nanocorrals, and the
subsequent molecular self-assembly studies at the liquid–solid
interface using PCDA. The PCDA lamellae alignment is controlled by
nanoshaving within in situ created nanocorrals. Corrals
formed ex situ do not display the same alignment
behavior.

Here, nanoshaving and subsequent liquid–solid
PCDA self-assembly
experiments are performed both in situ (corral creation
as well as PCDA self-assembly occurs in a single step at the liquid–solid
interface) and ex situ (corral creation under dry
conditions followed by PCDA self-assembly at the liquid–solid
interface). Corrals formed ex situ show negligible
impact on the PCDA domain size and shape. However, the gradual exposure
of the graphite surface from in situ nanoshaving
is shown to have a pronounced effect on 2D crystal nucleation and
growth processes through the observation of fewer yet much larger
domains. Using different in situ corrals, we demonstrate
how nucleation and growth events involved in self-assembly can be
placed under geometric and kinetic constraints to preferentially bias
resultant PCDA lamellae orientation. This knowledge is used to design
and experimentally demonstrate “seeding and growth”
under nanoconfinement conditions.

Results and Discussion
Supramolecular
Self-Assembly of PCDA on Unconfined HOPG
First, supramolecular
self-assembly of PCDA on freshly cleaved HOPG
was evaluated as an internal benchmark for comparison studies between
the self-assemblies of PCDA38−40 on open terraces and laterally
confined terraces. As shown in Figure 2, PCDA readily self-assembles at the 1-PO/HOPG interface.
Individual molecules are clearly distinguished in the STM images.
Self-assembly of the molecules is largely promoted by two types of
intermolecular interactions: directional hydrogen bonding between
the carboxylic acid moieties and van der Waals interactions between
neighboring alkyl chains. The supramolecular packing consists of rows
of parallel stacked molecules, called lamellae. The brightest features
in the STM image provided in Figure 2b correspond to the diacetylene units, which are tilted
with respect to alkyls. The darkest rows correspond to the meeting
of the methyl ends of the molecules, whereas the rows of medium contrast
are assigned to the regions of hydrogen bonding. The substrate epitaxy
is reflected in a selective orientation of the alkyl chains along
the high-symmetry axes of graphite. The angle, θ, between the
lamellae direction and the graphite axis with commensurate alkyls
was measured to be 86.7 ± 0.3°. This results in two equivalent
twinned domains for each of the three high-symmetry axes of graphite:
six domain orientations in total (Figure S2).

pA; those for (b), (c), and (d) are Vs = −0.8 V, It = 60 pA.

Nanocorral Creation
To create the
nanocorrals, the
HOPG surface was first covalently modified with a dense monolayer
of aryl species using cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical modification
of HOPG is carried out in aqueous solutions containing diazonium cations
generated in situ from stable aniline precursors.41 Incorporating sterically hindering substituents
on the aniline precursor limits the grafting to monolayer species.29,31 When concentrations greater than 2 mM are used, a high density of
monolayer aryl species can be covalently bound or “grafted”
to the surface. After diazotization, the mechanism of covalent attachment
involves reduction of the diazonium cation, expulsion of N2, and formation of aryl radicals. These unstable aryl radicals subsequently
react with the HOPG surface (see Figure 1a) through a radical addition reaction. The
result is a newly formed sp3-hybridized carbon–carbon
bond that covalently links the aryl species to the HOPG surface. Further
experimental details involving the preparation of the covalently grafted
HOPG are provided in the Methods section and Supporting Information.

Nanocorrals inside
the covalently modified HOPG surface are created with detailed control
over the nanoshaving process using the Keysight PicoLITH 2.1 software
package. Different shapes for the creation of nanocorrals are first
designed within the PicoLITH software (Figure S3). The software then rasters the STM tip in the desired areas
to nanoshave the corrals. The fast nanoshaving direction moves across the corral to define the width, and the slow direction
moves downward to define the height of the corral.
During this nanoshaving process, the STM is operating in high current
(typically 200 pA) and low sample bias (−1.0 mV). These scan
parameters bring the tip in close proximity to the graphite substrate,
such that the covalently bound aryls are degrafted and removed from
the surface, i.e., nanoshaving.
While the mechanism for this degrafting process is still poorly understood,
the HOPG surface carbon atoms have previously been demonstrated to
revert back to their original sp2 hybridization.29 Detailed investigations targeting the mechanism
of nanoshaving and its dependence on nanoshaving parameters (voltage,
tunneling current, and tip speed) are currently ongoing. In most cases,
the tip speed for nanoshaving was set to 400 nm/s. For all of the
corrals in this work, the distance covered along the slow nanoshaving
direction by each raster sweep varies only slightly (between 4.0 and
8.0 Å), depending on the corral size. Thus, the time required
to complete the nanoshaving depends on the area of the corral.

Assembly attempts on HOPG surfaces modified with a high density
of grafted species showed no self-assembly of PCDA on top or in between
the grafted features. Rather, the only observation made by STM imaging
is the grafted surface itself (Figure S4). In contrast, we have recently shown that when the grafting density
is lower, perturbations within the molecular self-assembly are observed.
In these cases, the grafted species act as barriers and impede self-assembly.42

Ex Situ vs in Situ Creation
of Nanocorrals
and Its Impact on the Assembly Process
To initially establish
an understanding of the influence of lateral confinement on the self-assembly
of PCDA, experiments were performed on bare (unconfined) HOPG, ex situ corrals, and in situ corrals (Figure 3). Ex situ corrals were created by nanoshaving the grafted (dry) surface, then
exposing the corrals to a 1-phenyloctane solution of PCDA. Within ex situ corrals, the entire nanocorral surface is exposed
and self-assembly can occur in all areas. The self-assembly of PCDA
inside an ex situ nanocorral (180 × 180 nm2) was found to be nearly identical to that observed on the
open terraces of unmodified HOPG. In both cases, domains of varying
size and orientation are observed (Figure 3a,b). This is a strong indication that multiple
nucleation events occurred. Despite the fluid environment above the
corral, ripening into single domains was not observed. Similar to
observations made by Beebe etal., the corral boundaries do not appear to favor nucleation, as unstable/no
self-assembly is observed at the edges (Figure S5).21 Empty surface regions are
also found in the assembly of PCDA on bare HOPG (Figure S5). Occasionally, features indicative of PCDA multilayer
lamellae are observed inside the ex situ nanocorrals.
STM topography measurements show the suspected multilayer structure
is ∼0.5 Å above the monolayer lamellae (Figure S6).43 Similar multilayer
structures from PCDA are also observed on the bare HOPG (Figure S6). Additional STM images of the ex situ corrals and of PCDA self-assembly within ex situ nanocorrals can be found in Figures S7 and S8, respectively. From our observations it
appears that assembly within relatively large ex situ corrals proceeds similar to that observed on bare HOPG.

In situ corrals were created by carrying out nanoshaving
directly in the presence of a 1-phenyloctane solution containing PCDA.
The self-assembly of PCDA was found to be drastically different in
corrals that are created in situ when compared to
bare HOPG or ex situ corrals. In situ corrals almost always show a single large domain of PCDA lamellae.
Importantly, the in situ created nanocorrals always
show the presence of PCDA networks inside them. Thus, the self-assembly
of PCDA within the in situ generated corral occurs
within the time needed for the nanoshaving and the subsequent imaging
scan (∼2 min). In comparison, the time lapse between the ex situ generation of corrals and the subsequent imaging
of the PCDA network was on the order of 1 h. Thus, the assembly behavior
of PCDA in the in situ nanocorrals cannot be the
result of a ripening effect occurring over time. Rather, the act of
nanoshaving inside the PCDA solution must govern the observed molecular
alignment within the nanocorrals.

In Situ Nanocorral Effects: Nanoshaving Orientation
with Respect to Graphite
The impact of lateral confinement
on PCDA self-assembly within the in situ nanocorrals
was further probed by rotating the nanoshaving orientation with respect
to the underlying hexagonal graphite lattice. Importantly, the slow
nanoshaving direction for the corral in Figure 3c is approximately orthogonal to a major axis of graphite, colored red. This creates a situation
where three possible general orientations of PCDA lamellae can occur
(Figure S9). Parallel, +60° diagonal,
and −60° diagonal domain orientations of the PCDA lamellae
can occur within the corral as defined by the angle between the direction
of slow nanoshaving and the lamellae direction. The assembly within
the corral appearing in Figure 3c is thus characterized as a parallel PCDA domain. In this
case, the long axis of the molecule is parallel with the fast nanoshaving
direction.

When the slow nanoshaving direction is rotated so
that it runs along a major graphite axis, a different
result is observed (Figure 3d). In this case, the lamellae align diagonally in the nanocorral.
Assemblies that demonstrate this behavior are referred to as diagonal
PCDA domains. Epitaxial matching and assembly constraints in the corral
require the molecules to arrange in either a diagonal (+30° or
−30°) or a perpendicular manner; a parallel alignment
is substrate registry forbidden (Figure S9).

The assembly of PCDA displays a domain twinning effect as
a result
of the 2D chirality (Figure S2). It was
not possible to selectively induce a specific 2D chirality within
any particular nanocorral. The angle separating the equivalent mirror
structures is reasoned to be too acute for such a selection. Therefore,
the twinned domains are treated equally, creating only three possible
categories for PCDA lamellae alignment for any specific nanoshaving
direction (Figure S9). A detailed explanation
of the nanoshaving process, the registry forbidden structures, and
the assignment of domain behavior is further described in the Supporting Information.

For a statistical
understanding of the dependence of the PCDA lamellae
orientation on the nanoshaving orientation with respect to graphite,
more than 50 in situ corrals of each type (orthogonal
to and along a graphite major symmetry axis) were created. For faster
analysis, the size of the nanocorral was reduced to ∼50 ×
50 nm2. When the square corrals are created with the slow
nanoshaving direction orthogonal to a major graphite axis, the PCDA
lamellae overwhelmingly (90.4%) assemble into parallel PCDA domains.
Compare this to the statistical outcome of 33.3%. When a diagonal
domain exists, they were typically accompanied by a separate parallel
domain (Figure S9). Alternatively, when
the slow nanoshaving direction was parallel to a major graphite axis,
the reverse was observed. Diagonal PCDA lamellae are slightly preferred
with a nearly equal population of + and – domains at 38.3%
and 37.9%, respectively. Perpendicular PCDA domains occupy only 23.8%
(Figure S9). These results demonstrate
that the orientation of slow nanoshaving direction with respect to
the symmetry axes of graphite can be used to influence the orientation
of PCDA lamellae within in situ corrals.

In
Situ Nanocorral Effects: Corral Size Impact
on PCDA Alignment
After establishing the difference between ex situ and in situ corrals, as well as
orientational effects relative to HOPG symmetry axes, we went on to
investigate the impact of the in situ nanocorral
size on PCDA self-assembly. Corrals of varying sizes were created
to evaluate how the nanocorral size affects the PCDA lamellae directionality
bias observed from in situ nanoshaving. The nanocorrals
were created by orienting the slow nanoshaving direction orthogonal
to the graphite lattice, allowing the PCDA lamellae to preferentially
align parallel. The results of this size-dependent study are shown
in Figure 4a. In the
four larger corrals (average size: 67 × 67 nm2, 46
× 46 nm2, 37 × 37 nm2, 28 × 28
nm2) the results are consistent with those presented in Figure 3c, where the lamellae
align along the slow nanoshaving direction. For the two smaller corrals
(20 × 20 nm2 and 11 × 11 nm2) the
PCDA lamellae are not aligned along the slow nanoshaving direction
(inset Figure 4a).
Instead, the lamellae are aligned diagonally with respect to the slow
nanoshaving direction. A statistical representation of the dependence
of lamellae orientation on the corral size is presented with a red-colored
trend in Figure 4b.
Statistics were acquired by counting the number of domains present
in each corral for each particular orientation. In general, the alignment
of PCDA lamellae in larger corrals is consistent until the corral
size approaches ∼30 nm. Below this size, the tendency of the
lamellae to preferentially orient parallel decreases sharply and eventually
it becomes close to the statistically unbiased outcome within corrals
of ∼10 nm lateral size (Figure 4b). Thus, the orientational bias of the PCDA lamellae
within in situ generated corrals is dependent on
the size of the corral.

situ created
nanocorrals with different sizes. Parallel PCDA alignment in the larger
corrals and diagonal PCDA alignment in the smaller corrals (inset)
are observed. Nanoshaving was performed from top to bottom for all
structures shown. The high-symmetry axes of graphite are represented

smaller nanocorrals. (b) Graph relating the size of the nanocorrals
to the probability of self-assembly within the nanocorrals (black)
and the relative frequency of PCDA domains aligned along the nanoshaving
direction (red). The blue dashed line represents the statistically
unbiased alignment outcome. At least 50 nanocorrals were analyzed
for each corral size.

The corral size also influences the probability of self-assembly
when significant confinement restraints exist (Figure 4b, black). Self-assembly is frequently observed
inside square corrals of 20 × 20 nm2 or larger. However,
the propensity of the PCDA molecules to self-assemble inside corrals
of 10 × 10 nm2 is reduced to 65% (Figure 4b, black). A representative
image of these empty corrals is shown in Figure S10. This observation is consistent with previous studies,
where decreasing the size of the confined space results in prolonged
molecular ordering time scales.21 It is
important to note that only the image immediately after nanocorral
creation was used for the analysis of the assembly statistics. Time-dependent
studies under these strict nanoconfinement conditions are expected
to produce other valuable insights. Nevertheless, the smallest corral
created was suitable for assembly and STM imaging of an ordered PCDA
domain. Corrals below 10 nm could not reliably be created with size
and shape control. At such a small scale, the corral size begins to
approach the dimension of the covalently bound aryls that confine
the assembly.

In Situ Nanocorral Effects:
Geometric Shape
Impact on PCDA Alignment
To further investigate the impact
of in situ nanocorral formation on the resultant
PCDA assembly, the geometric shape of the corral was changed. Again,
the slow nanoshaving direction was carefully chosen to promote parallel
PCDA lamellae alignment. Nanocorrals in the shape of a square, a circle,
a downward facing triangle, and an upward facing triangle are shown
in Figure 5. The lamellae
of PCDA align with preference along the slow nanoshaving direction
for the square, the circle, and the downward triangle. A statistical
analysis with more than 30 corrals of each particular shape is shown
comparing the relative number of domains with a particular orientation
(Figure 5). With 86%
preference, the square fosters the formation of lamellae parallel
to the slow nanoshaving direction. Similarly, the PCDA lamellae in
circular corrals and downward triangles show a pronounced tendency
to align (80% and 83%, respectively) along the slow nanoshaving direction.
The upward triangle, on the other hand, dramatically reduces this
alignment trend with only 66% alignment along the slow nanoshaving
direction. A (+) diagonally aligned domain inside the upright triangle,
occupying 22% of the total population, is shown in Figure 5d. The triangle study demonstrates
how the method (top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) of nanoshaving a particular
shape can alter the tendency of PCDA lamellae to preferentially align.
More importantly, this study demonstrates that the initial stages
of the corral formation must play an important role in directing the
PCDA self-assembly. Hence, the seeding and growth of the assembly
of PCDA must take place as the HOPG surface is being gradually exposed.

height corresponds to approximately 70 nm for each shape. Nanoshaving
direction was the same for all shapes and is indicated in the STM

lamellae direction inside the corrals appears alongside each image,

(blue) orientation of the lamellae. The high-symmetry axes of graphite
are represented by black arrows. (a)–(d) Vs = −0.8 V, It = 60
pA.

Origin of Preferential
PCDA Lamellae Alignment
The
question thus arises: how does the nanoshaving of in situ nanocorrals give rise to preferential parallel PCDA lamellae alignment?
Standard self-assembly of molecules at the liquid–solid interface
proceeds in three distinct stages: nucleation, free growth, and ripening.44 When molecules are deposited on freshly cleaved
HOPG, all of these processes contribute to the final observed structure.
We propose, however, that the gradual revelation of the surface from in situ nanoshaving at the liquid–solid interface
gives rise to a combination of geometric and kinetic constraints that
affect the standard processes by which self-assembly typically occurs.

To demonstrate the concept of geometric constraints, we focus on
the variations observed in the corral size study. Importantly, the
nanoshaving of each individual corral was completed, starting with
the largest corral, before moving on to the next corral. The shaving
rate is consistently held at 400 nm/s. Thus, the time required for
nanoshaving each particular corral decreases
proportionally with decreasing size of the corral. This also creates
a situation where the geometric limitations placed on the system at
the initial stages of corral formation are very different for each
particular corral. At early stages (<2 s) of nanoshaving, the largest
corrals exist as high aspect ratio rectangles where assembly can occur.
On the other hand, the aspect ratio for the smaller nanocorrals is
drastically lower for the same nanoshaving time (Figure S11). While the total nanoshaving area between the
corrals is the same at these early times, the geometric constraints
are very different (Figure S11). Ultimately,
these different constraint conditions are believed to bias the nucleation
and growth processes to impact the observed size-dependent preferential
alignment.

The behavior observed in the upright and downward
triangles provides
strong evidence that kinetic factors created by the nanoshaving process
are also influential in determining the available PCDA orientations
for adsorption. The downward facing triangle is first nanoshaved along
the base, whereas the upright triangle is nanoshaved from the apex
first. This places the assembly of PCDA within both corrals under
different kinetic constraints that limit the possible orientations
for adsorption of PCDA (Figure S12). During
the initial stages of corral formation, nanoshaving from the triangular
base restricts the options for PCDA assembly to one particular orientation
with respect to the graphite lattice (Figure S13). However, nanoshaving from the apex of the triangle opens the diagonal
axes of the graphite surface at the same rate as the parallel orientation
(Figure S13). Thus, the “method”
of nanoshaving the triangle creates kinetic limitations that can restrict
the possible PCDA assembly orientations. It is important to note that
the same geometric constraints that exist within the varying sized
corrals also play an important role in the triangular assembly as
well. The corral size series is also influenced by similar kinetic
factors that restrict assembly to one particular orientation for a
period of time. Given the same nanoshaving rate, the time scales of
these kinetic restrictions decrease proportionally with the size of
the corral. Through these kinetic and geometric constraints, in situ nanoshaving afforded control over nucleation and
growth processes to preferentially select specific orientations of
the PCDA lamellae.

Finally, the presence of the potentially
large STM tip in close
proximity to the newly created corrals places an additional kinetic
constraint on molecular adsorption events. Steric blocking effects
from the tip are expected to hinder molecular diffusion in the vicinity
of the tip. During this time, the PCDA molecules may experience limited
access to the exposed surface. This effect is particularly impactful
when the dimensionality of the corral is similar to that of the tip.
Such restrictions to PCDA self-assembly place additional kinetic constraints
on the system that likely impact the observed orientation of the PCDA
lamellae within small corrals (below 30 × 30 nm2).
Similarly, for the upward facing triangle steric hindrance of the
tip might delay PCDA self-assembly within the initial degrafted area.

Assembly alignment observed in previous work from Beebe etal. inside ex situ fabricated
corrals likely occurs via different pathways.21 In their work, formation of a film using a pure
liquid compound resulted in assembly inside etched corrals, as well
as on the open terraces of HOPG. Ripening effects and registry impacts
from the assembly on the open terraces and elevated layers are believed
to contribute to the observed alignment.21 In our work, corrals of similar size to the work from Beebe etal. fabricated under dry conditions
(ex situ) and later topped with a PCDA solution in
1-phenyloctane yielded multiple domain orientations. This suggests
that multiple nucleation events are responsible for the final observed
structure, which is not surprising given the relatively large size
of the corral (∼180 × 180 nm2) when compared
to the average domain size on bare HOPG (Figure 3a). Since no assembly is observed on top
of the covalently modified graphite, our assemblies cannot experience
the same registry/ripening effects from open terrace assemblies. Related
to Beebe’s work, we observe poor ordering at the corral boundaries,
also suggesting an assembly inhibition from corral perimeters. We
also never observed full molecular disassembly and reorientation within
the corrals, but dynamics were occasionally observed. Beebe’s
methods allow for confinement studies on elevated terraces. With our
corrals, such an investigation is not possible. Size, shape, and orientation
control on the graphite surface can, however, be achieved. This control
motivated us to probe nucleation and growth events with this highly
precise method for confining molecules.

In Situ Nanocorral Effects: Seeding and Growth
Demonstration
Using the constraints inherent to in
situ nanocorrals, we designed an experiment to directly demonstrate
the basic crystallization concept45,46 of “seeding
and growth” under nanoconfinement conditions. The experiment
involves the creation of a circular seed corral followed by two other
rectangular arm corrals made in the presence of PCDA to allow additional
growth. First, the expected alignment is shown by creating the individual
corrals separately (Figure 6a). In this case, the alignment of the domain of PCDA lamellae
inside the circular seed is parallel. Similarly, the alignment of
PCDA inside the rectangular arm is also classified as parallel (given
the slow nanoshaving direction), but the orientation with respect
to the circular seed is clearly different. This result is expected
given the nanoshaving orientation of the corrals with respect to the
major graphite axes.

Figure 6 (a) STM image of PCDA self-assembly within a spatially
separated
circular corral and two additional rectangular corrals. (b) STM image
of the seed and growth experiment where the circular seed corral is
directly connected to the rectangular arm corrals. In this case alternative
alignment is observed inside the rectangular arms. The numbers represent
the order in which the structures were made. Nanoshaving direction
and high-symmetry-graphite axes are indicated. Vs = −0.8 V, It = 60 pA.

In a separate experiment, the
rectangular arms are overlapped with
the circular seed when the nanoshaving is performed. Importantly,
the circular seed is nanoshaved first followed by the rectangular
arms. In this case, the lamellae within the rectangular corrals are
in registry with the lamellae inside the circular seed corral (Figure 6b). The PCDA lamellae
are observed to run continuously from the seed into the arms. Hence,
once the seed domain was formed, the PCDA growth upon exposure of
additional free graphite (rectangular arm) is observed in the same
direction as the lamellae observed in the seed. Occasionally, new
nucleation events occur inside the arms and create domain boundaries
(Figure 6b, top rectangle).
The propensity for these new nucleation events within the rectangular
corrals is expected to be dependent on the seed (and arm) size, shape,
orientation, and degrafting parameters. These parameters along with
the rate of surface exposure and concentration impact on 2D crystal
nucleation and growth are currently under more detailed investigation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have revealed several general
effects involved
in laterally confined molecular self-assembly occurring inside nanocorrals
at a liquid–solid interface. Corrals of various size, shape,
and orientation are fabricated by in situ STM nanoshaving
on covalently modified HOPG surfaces. Statistical analysis of these
results demonstrates the importance of geometric and kinetic constraints
on the resultant assembly orientation. Confinement effects during
the initial stages of nanocorral formation are shown to strongly affect
nucleation and growth processes. Furthermore, the confinement constraints
placed on the assembly were employed for control over “seeding
and growth” processes under nanoconfinement conditions. In
the future coupling these corral methods with fast scanning probe
microscopy techniques may allow direct observation of molecular assembly
events.20 Confinement impacts on switching,
chirality, multicomponent assembly, phase transitions, and stimuli-responsive
networks are expected to emerge.1 The concept
of nanoshaving can possibly be extended to surfaces other than HOPG,
given that diazonium modification on both conducting metals and semiconducting
silicon surfaces is well documented.32,47−53 The nanocorral approach and confinement principles described herein
are expected to be invaluable tools for future studies on the thermodynamic
and kinetic parameters involved in crystallization.

Methods
STM Experiments
All experiments
were performed at room
temperature (20–22 °C) using a PicoLE (Keysight) or Molecular
Imaging STM system operating in constant-current mode at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG
interface. STM tips were prepared by mechanical cutting from Pt/Ir
wire (80%/20%, diameter 0.25 mm). For self-assembly imaging, a saturated
solution of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (≥97%) in 1-phenyloctane
(98%) was drop-casted on the surface of a freshly cleaved (or covalently
modified) HOPG substrate (grade ZYB, Advanced Ceramics Inc., Cleveland,
OH, USA). Both PCDA and 1-phenyloctane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. The reported unit cell parameters
of PCDA on HOPG are averaged values deduced from examination of six
images that have been corrected for drift using recorded graphite
images under the same conditions except for Vs = −1 mV and It = 200 pA.
Nanoshaving was performed using the PicoLITH v.2.1 software. All images
were processed using the Scanning Probe Imaging Processor (SPIP) software
(Image Metrology ApS). Imaging parameters are indicated in the figure
captions and are denoted by Vs for the
sample bias and It for the tunneling current.

Covalent Modification of HOPG
Electrochemical grafting
of 3,5-bis-tert-butylbenzenediazonium (3,5-TBD) was
performed using cyclic voltammetry in aqueous solutions. Due to the
low stability of 3,5-TBD, it was generated in situ from the corresponding aniline compound. To this end, ≥3
mg of 3,5-bis-tert-butylaniline (3,5-TBA) was dissolved
in 5 mL of aqueous hydrochloric acid (50 mM), and 100 μL of
aqueous NaNO2 (0.1 M) was added for activation of the diazotization
reaction. The solution was gently shaken for 1.5 min before injection
into the electrochemical cell. A lab-built single-compartment three-electrode
cell, with a working electrode area of 50.3 mm2, Pt wire
counter, and Ag/AgCl/3.0 M NaCl reference electrode was used to carry
out the cyclic voltammetry. Prior to each experiment, the HOPG working
electrode was freshly cleaved using Scotch tape. A typical current–voltage
diagram obtained during cyclic voltammetry is shown in Figure S1. Every experiment consisted of three
voltage sweeps. After modification, the HOPG samples were rinsed with
Milli-Q water to remove any physisorbed material from the surface.
3,5-Bis-tert-butylaniline (98%) and analytical grade
hydrochloric acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification. High-purity water (Milli-Q, Millipore, 18.2
MΩ cm, TOC < 3 ppb) was used for preparation of the aqueous
solutions. All electrochemical measurements were performed using an
Autolab PGSTAT101 potentiostat (Metrohm_Autolab BV, The Netherlands).
