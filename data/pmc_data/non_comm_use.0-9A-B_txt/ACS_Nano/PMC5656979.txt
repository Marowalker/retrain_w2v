The
current study generates profound atomistic insights into doping-induced
changes of the optical and electronic properties of the prototypical
PTCDA/Ag(111) interface. For doping K atoms are used, as KxPTCDA/Ag(111) has the distinct advantage of forming
well-defined stoichiometric phases. To arrive at a conclusive, unambiguous,
and fully atomistic understanding of the interface properties, we
combine state-of-the-art density-functional theory calculations with
optical differential reflectance data, photoelectron spectra, and
X-ray standing wave measurements. In combination with the full structural
characterization of the KxPTCDA/Ag(111)
interface by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments (ACS Nano2016, 10, 2365–2374), the present comprehensive
study provides access to a fully characterized reference system for
a well-defined metal–organic interface in the presence of dopant
atoms, which can serve as an ideal benchmark for future research and
applications. The combination of the employed complementary techniques
allows us to understand the peculiarities of the optical spectra of
K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and their counterintuitive similarity to
those of neutral PTCDA layers. They also clearly describe the transition
from a metallic character of the (pristine) adsorbed PTCDA layer on
Ag(111) to a semiconducting state upon doping, which is the opposite
of the effect (degenerate) doping usually has on semiconducting materials.
All experimental and theoretical efforts also unanimously reveal a
reduced electronic coupling between the adsorbate and the substrate,
which goes hand in hand with an increasing adsorption distance of
the PTCDA molecules caused by a bending of their carboxylic oxygens
away from the substrate and toward the potassium atoms.

Alkali-metal-doped
organic semiconductor
films have demonstrated a wide variety of interesting properties and
have been used in numerous applications ranging from superconductivity1−5 to hydrogen storage6,7 and batteries.8 Additionally, it has been shown that alkali-metal doping
can be exploited to tune the spin properties of a hybrid ferromagnetic
metal–organic interface.9 The charge
transfer between alkali-metal atoms and organic molecules also strongly
impacts the electronic properties of the latter.10 This is highly relevant for carrier injection in electronic
devices,11,12 as the energy level alignment at the interfaces
between the metal electrode and the active organic layer can be tuned
by changing the stoichiometry of the dopant–host network.13,14 Consequently, alkali-metal doping has been shown to increase the
efficiency of organic light-emitting devices.15 The doping-induced charge transfer also significantly influences
the optical properties of organic molecules,16 where the nature of the formed intragap states depends on the amount
of induced charges rather than the type of the dopant used.17

Understanding the effect of alkali-metal
doping on organic monolayers
strongly interacting with metal substrates is particularly challenging.
The reasons for that are twofold: First, the structure of the organic
adsorbate layer can change significantly in the presence of alkali
metal atoms,18,19 which can have a crucial impact
on both the electronic and optical properties of the interface. Second,
one is dealing with a complex interplay of charge transfer and potentially
also covalent interactions occurring between the dopants and organic
molecules, the dopants and the substrate, and the substrate and the
adsorbed organic molecules. In fact, under certain circumstances alkali-metal
atoms have been found to decouple adsorbate molecules from metal substrates,20 and for the sexiphenyl/Cu(110) interface at
low doping concentrations they even result in a depopulation of formerly
occupied states in the organic layer.21 As a consequence, to arrive at a conclusive picture, it is crucial
to combine a variety of experimental techniques that provide information
on the structural, optical, and electronic properties of the studied
system with state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The
simulations, on one hand, allow an unambiguous interpretation of the
experimental observations and, on the other hand, provide microscopic
insight into charge-density rearrangements occurring at the interface.

K-doped perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) on
Ag(111) is a particularly well-suited system for studying the impact
of doping on a molecular monolayer in the presence of interfacial
charge transfer with a metal substrate. The reasons for this are (i)
that PTCDA on Ag(111) is undisputedly the best investigated interface
between a noble metal surface and an organic semiconductor molecule22−26 and (ii) that only specific phases of KxPTCDA with well-defined stoichiometries exist on Ag(111), as known
from a previous study:19 At comparably
low K-doping levels (in the following referred to as K2PTCDA/Ag(111)), the well-known herringbone structure of PTCDA on
Ag(111)22 (see Figure 1a) spontaneously converts into another highly
ordered phase with two K atoms and one PTCDA molecule per adsorbate
unit cell. The latter is characterized by a point-on-line (POL) epitaxial
relation to the substrate.27 The potassium
atoms are located between the carboxylic and anhydride oxygen atoms,
as shown in the structural model in Figure 1b. At higher doping levels, a second phase
transition occurs and the resulting structure is characterized again
by rows of K atoms arranged between rows of PTCDA molecules (Figure 1c). However, in this
structural phase, the molecules are oriented essentially perpendicular
to the direction of the potassium rows, and there are four potassium
atoms per molecule (thus, this phase will be referred to as K4PTCDA/Ag(111)). No intermediate phases (such as K1PTCDA or K3PTCDA) have been observed, which significantly
eases the interpretation of the obtained spectra. Rather, at intermediate
doping levels the above-mentioned stable phases coexist. Only at even
higher potassium content has another well-ordered phase been detected,
which is, however, unstable and degrades within an hour at room temperature
by segregation of K, thereby forming the K4PTCDA/Ag(111)
phase with a relatively high defect concentration.19

Figure 1 Structures of the (a) PTCDA, (b) K2PTCDA, and (c) K4PTCDA adsorbate layers (studied in the present paper) as previously
determined by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and distortion-corrected
low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) experiments in combination
with DFT simulations.19 Atoms are depicted
with circles colored as follows: yellow for C, blue for H, red for
O, white for Ag, and green for K. The parallelograms indicate the
surface unit cells of the interface used for the calculations. Only
first-layer Ag atoms are shown; their positions are the ones used
in the simulations (including minor distortions of the Ag substrate
to generate commensurate structures, cf. Methods section.).

Here we present an in-depth study on how these structural
and chemical
changes of the adsorbate layer affect its optical and electronic properties.
We start with a detailed discussion of the optical properties of the
metal–organic interface obtained by differential reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS) experiments. For the systems studied here, these,
however, yield ambiguous results and do not allow arriving at a conclusive
understanding of how the electronic structure of the interface changes
upon K doping. To properly understand the observed trends, we therefore
performed state-of-the-art simulations relying both on open boundary
conditions for free molecules and on periodic ones for adsorbed PTCDA.
These are combined with photoelectron spectroscopy and normal incidence
X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) studies to obtain the energy level alignment
of the occupied frontier orbitals and vertical adsorption distances,
respectively. In this way, we are finally able to unambiguously assign
the observed optical features and to achieve an in-depth atomistic
understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the prototypical
interfaces studied here.

Results and Discussion
Optical Properties
Monolayer films of pristine and
K-doped PTCDA were grown under ultra-high-vacuum conditions, as described
in ref (19). During
the growth of PTCDA and the subsequent deposition of K we performed
DRS experiments in real time to determine the optical properties of
the samples.28 From the DRS raw data, the
imaginary part of the dielectric function of the adsorbate layer εads″ was extracted
as described in the Methods section and, in
greater detail, in the Supporting Information.

The εads″ spectra for PTCDA on Ag(111) at various K doping stages
are shown in Figure 2 together with the results of previous DRS investigations for PTCDA
on Au(111) and on mica.29,30 The latter are employed
here as reference spectra, which can be used to identify the spectral
features of the K-doped PTCDA films. The spectrum of the pristine
PTCDA layer on Ag(111) (black dashed curve in Figure 2a) is significantly broadened and clearly
red-shifted compared to that of pristine PTCDA on mica (dashed olive-green
curve in Figure 2c).
The latter is dominated by largely unperturbed molecular excitations
comparable to those of PTCDA dissolved, for example, in dichloromethane31 or isolated in a xenon matrix.32 The broadening and shift of the spectrum on Ag(111) can
be interpreted as an indication of a strong (chemical) interaction
between the adsorbate layer and the substrate. It is well established
that this results in a significant charge transfer from the Ag substrate
to the PTCDA molecules and that, consequently, the band derived from
the LUMO of PTCDA becomes partially filled24,26,33 (vide infra). In that context
it is interesting to point out that the maximum of εads″ for PTCDA/Ag(111)
in the displayed energy range is found at essentially the same energy
as for the PTCDA monoanion on mica (dotted gray curve in Figure 2c).30 This fact will be the subject of a detailed discussion
later in this paper.

Figure 2 εads″ spectra extracted from the DRS raw data of PTCDA on
Ag(111) at various
K-doping stages: (a) PTCDA/Ag(111) [d = 0.7 ML],
K2PTCDA/Ag(111), and (b) K4PTCDA/Ag(111). Intermediate
doping regimes are characterized by a coexistence of the stable PTCDA/Ag(111),
K2PTCDA/Ag(111), and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) phases.19 In comparison, panel (c) shows additional spectra
for other interfaces containing PTCDA. These are in particular εads″ data
for 1 ML of PTCDA on Au(111) (from ref (29)), 1 ML of neutral PTCDA, PTCDA monoanions (PTCDA•–), and PTCDA dianions (PTCDA2–), where PTCDA was deposited on mica and subsequently doped with
potassium to produce the charged species (from ref (30)). The εads″ spectra
in (c) are smoothed and normalized to their most intense feature.

Upon depositing K, the optical
features sharpen and shift to higher
energies with the strongest peak fitted at 2.19 eV and a low-energy
shoulder remaining at 1.73 eV. That shoulder is essentially at the
same energy as the peak for PTCDA/Ag(111). For an intermediate doping
regime corresponding to K2PTCDA (solid red curve in Figure 2a), the spectrum
strongly resembles a superposition of the PTCDA on the Ag(111) spectrum
and that of the PTCDA monolayer on Au(111) (solid orange curve in Figure 2c). Interestingly,
for the latter it is well established that the adsorbate layer is
essentially charge neutral with no charge transfer from the substrate.24−26,34 Thus, the evolution of the optical
spectra at intermediate doping levels seems to imply that the deposited
potassium oxidizes rather than further reduces the PTCDA layer, which
contradicts chemical intuition. Exactly this behavior (namely, a reduction
of the electron density on the adsorbate due to alkali-metal deposition)
has, however, been observed by angle-resolved ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (ARUPS) at low Cs-doping concentrations for the sexiphenyl/Cu(110)
interface due to a Cs-induced decoupling of the adsorbate from the
substrate.21

For the present interface
the scenario of a K-induced oxidation
is called into question by the evolution of the spectra upon additional
K deposition depicted in Figure 2b: For K4PTCDA (solid blue curve) one observes
a further blue-shift and sharpening of the spectral features with
a clearly resolved double-peak structure of the main maxima at 1.80
and 2.29 eV and their corresponding vibronic replica on the high-energy
sides (vide infra). The final spectrum is strongly
reminiscent of that of the PTCDA dianion on mica (solid blue curve
in Figure 2c).30 This observation would be indicative of the a priori expected further reduction of the PTCDA layer by
K doping (a trend also observed when increasing the Cs dose for the
above-mentioned sexiphenyl/Cu(110) interface21). Considering the increasingly sharper features upon K deposition,
this chemical reduction would actually go hand in hand with an electronic
decoupling of the adsorbate layer from the Ag(111) substrate.

To resolve the conundrums arising from interpreting the DRS data
(viz., the reduction vs oxidation
of the PTCDA layer on Ag(111) upon K deposition) and to unambiguously
identify the actual electronic structure of the interface, we performed
simulations based on dispersion-corrected density-functional theory
employing both periodic boundary conditions (when modeling extended
interfaces) and open boundary conditions (when simulating molecular
excitations). These simulations are backed up by additional ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and NIXSW experiments.

Density of
States
A first quantity to analyze in order
to understand how charges are rearranged upon K doping is the calculated
total density of states projected onto the adsorbate layer (i.e., the PDOS) for the different cases
(see Figure 3a–d). Figure 3a shows the PDOS
of gas phase PTCDA; the PDOS of PTCDA upon adsorption on Ag(111) can
be seen in Figure 3b. The partial filling of the LUMO-derived band is clearly observed
in the simulations and is also confirmed by the UPS experiments (Figure 3e). This indicates
a metallic nature of the adsorbate layer (vide supra).24,26,34 Note that
in the following we will label bands by the names of the orbitals
in the neutral molecule that they are derived from. This is done to
avoid confusions arising from using the same names for symmetry-inequivalent
bands just as a consequence of different degrees of charging.

Figure 3 (a) Gas phase

states projected onto the adsorbate layer for (b) PTCDA/Ag(111) (black),
(c) K2PTCDA/Ag(111) (red), and (d) K4PTCDA/Ag(111)
(blue). We did not include K in the PDOS as it had minimal influence
on the plots. The curves with areas shaded in different colors have
been obtained employing a Gaussian broadening of 0.11 eV (FWHM). The
PDOS shaded in white has been plotted using a reduced broadening of
0.02 eV (FWHM), and its magnitude has been reduced by a factor of
5. HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 of PTCDA are marked as “H”,
“L”, “L+1”, and “L+2”, respectively.
Panel (e) comprises the experimental UPS data at various doping stages
(black: PTCDA/Ag(111), red: K2PTCDA/Ag(111); and blue:
K4PTCDA/Ag(111)).

Interestingly, especially the LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 derived bands for the PTCDA/Ag(111) interface
broaden significantly compared to the gas phase molecule. The resulting
peak width is a measure for the level of hybridization of the electronic
states of the adsorbed molecules with the substrate continuum and
for the coupling between molecules in the adsorbate layer (note that
no vibronic finestructure is considered in the present calculations).
A complication when quantifying the peak widths arises from the fact
that all plotted DOSs contain an extrinsic Gaussian broadening, which
is necessary to avoid artifacts due to the finite number of Ag layers
in the slabs (instead of using a semi-infinite model for the Ag surface)35 and due to the finite k-point
sampling (cf., Methods section).
Nevertheless, applying the procedure described in detail in the Supporting Information, one can obtain an estimate
for the intrinsic line width. In this way, for the LUMO-derived band
in PTCDA/Ag(111) in Figure 3b a value of 0.26 eV is obtained for the FWHM.

The electron
transfer from the substrate to the adsorbate for PTCDA/Ag(111)
is also confirmed by the net charges residing on the PTCDA layer as
derived from both a Löwdin-36 and
a Bader-type37 charge partitioning, the
latter determined by means of a different plane-wave code in ref (19). Both approaches provide
equivalent results, namely, the transfer of approximately one electron
per PTCDA molecule (see Table 1). The seeming discrepancy between this value and the significantly
above 50% filling of the LUMO-derived band (Figure 3) can be resolved by considering that at
interfaces between acceptors bearing functional groups that strongly
interact with the substrate one observes a delicate balance between
charge forward and backward donation. In such a situation, the transfer
of electrons to the LUMO is partially compensated by a back-transfer
of electrons from the functional groups to the substrate involving
strongly hybridizing molecular orbitals.38 This effect has been described previously also for the PTCDA/Ag(111)
interface.26,39

per K atom; those for PTCDA and Ag per PTCDA molecule. As partitioning
into atomic and molecular charges is not an unambiguous process, we
also report (in parentheses) values obtained by the alternative partitioning
into Bader charges (from the Supporting Information of ref (19)).

Another observation for PTCDA adsorbed on the Ag(111)
surface is
that the (peak-to-peak) HOMO–LUMO gap is reduced by 0.4 eV
compared to an isolated PTCDA molecule (Figure 3a). This is not due to screening effects
at the metal surface, as these are not accounted for when merely looking
at Kohn–Sham energies at the PBE level. It is also not related
to the monolayer formation, as for a hypothetical free-standing monolayer
we observe the same gap as for the isolated molecules (again bearing
in mind that screening for excited states is not included in a ground-state
calculation). Rather, the reduction of the gap can be interpreted
as a consequence of the strong coupling between electronic and nuclear
degrees of freedom in conjugated organic materials and the resulting
molecular distortions in the charged molecules.40

Upon K doping all features in the calculated PDOS
shift to higher
binding energies and the LUMO-derived band becomes completely filled,
resulting in no states at the Fermi level. This means that there is
a metal-to-semiconductor phase transition of the PTCDA monolayer adsorbed
on Ag(111) upon K doping, a phenomenon commonly observed when interfaces
containing organic semiconductors are doped with alkali metals.13,18,41 This is consistent with the corresponding
charges on the molecule (Table 1), which clearly show that the electron density on the molecule
is further increased. The extent to which this is also a consequence
of a reduced back-donation from deeper-lying orbitals involving the
carboxylic oxygens is difficult to quantify, but the changes in adsorbate
geometry suggest that this effect is also of some relevance. Interestingly,
the width of the LUMO-derived peak in the DOS is significantly reduced
to 0.14 eV for K2PTCDA/Ag(111), which amounts to nearly
a factor of 2 compared to PTCDA/Ag(111) (see Supporting Information for more details) (Figure 3c).

Notably, a shift to higher binding
energies and a complete filling
of the LUMO-derived band is also seen in the experimental UPS data
for K2PTCDA (Figure 3e). A similar observation has in fact been made in UPS studies
of PTCDA on the Ag(110) surface upon potassium deposition in spite
of the fundamentally different interface geometry at that metal surface,
with K atoms substituting Ag atomic rows below the oxygens of the
PTCDA molecules.42

For K4PTCDA/Ag(111) the trends already observed for
K2PTCDA/Ag(111) prevail both in the simulations and in
the experiments, with the shift toward higher binding energies being
somewhat larger. Concomitantly, the net charge on the PTCDA molecules
increases (Table 1).
Also the peaks in the PDOS sharpen further, and the intrinsic line
width of the LUMO-derived feature is reduced by another factor of
2 to 0.07 eV (see Supporting Information). At the same time, the splitting between the LUMO+1 and the LUMO+2
increases compared to lower doping stages. The scenario of charge
transfer depicted here is additionally validated by the excellent
agreement between the experimental and calculated changes of the surface
work function with doping (vide infra).

The main conclusion
from the above considerations is that at none
of the doping stages is a K-induced reduction of the electron density
in the PTCDA layer observed, as had been tentatively assumed based
on the similar positions of the main peaks in the DR spectra of K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and PTCDA/Au(111) layers (vide supra). Thus, to reconcile the calculated PDOSs and measured UPS data
with the results of the DRS measurements, a more in-depth discussion
of the optical properties of pristine and doped PTCDA layers is required.

Simulated Optical Properties of Molecules and Adsorbate Layers
Ideally, the simulations of the optical properties should account
for the 2D extended interfaces including the metal substrate. For
that, slab-type calculations employing periodic boundary conditions
would be required. At the same time excitonic effects need to be accounted
for, as they are highly relevant in molecular layers. Indeed, simulations
including the necessary many-body effects also for infinitely extended
crystalline systems are generally possible. They rely, for example,
on solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) and have been
performed for molecular and polymer crystals.43−46 Recently, even implementations
of the BSE for adsorbed molecules have been developed,47 building, however, on system-specific assumptions
that do not apply here (e.g., that
the adsorbate’s HOMO lies in the band gap of a semiconducting
substrate).

Consequently, BSE-type calculations on interfaces
as complex as the present one are still beyond reach. Therefore, we
resorted to a dual strategy: We first calculated optical properties
including excitonic effects for neutral and charged PTCDA molecules
in the gas phase using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).
There, we tried to correlate the properties of the excitons with those
of the molecular orbitals that dominate their description. Provided
that the exciton is primarily represented by the
excitation from a specific occupied to a specific unoccupied orbital,
the optical properties of the interface can be directly correlated
with the evolutions of the calculated densities of states. As a second
step, we also simulated excitation spectra based on the independent
particle approximation relying on the calculated Kohn–Sham
orbitals of the extended interfaces. In these calculations the interaction
with the substrate and with dopant atoms is directly considered, but
excitonic effects are neglected.

Following that strategy, we
report the molecular excitation energies
and excited-state properties (obtained using TD-DFT) in Table 2. The corresponding orbital
energies are contained in the Supporting Information together with the isodensity plots of the orbitals. Several relevant
insights can be gained from those data: (i) The main absorption features
of the neutral PTCDA molecule and the dianion are found at essentially
the same energies (2.17 eV vs 2.25 eV). This occurs
in spite of the fact that they are dominated by different single-particle
excitations (the HOMO → LUMO transition in the neutral case
and a transition from the now doubly occupied LUMO to the LUMO+2 in
the dianion). Consequently, the similarity of the transition energies
and oscillator strengths for those peaks are a mere coincidence. Therefore,
the similarity of the peak positions in the measured optical absorption
data of K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and PTCDA/Au(111) discussed above
do not necessarily imply that the two films are in the same charge
state. (ii) In the dianion there is a weaker peak at ∼0.5 eV
below the main maximum. This peak is dominated by a LUMO to LUMO+1
excitation and can be associated with the lower energy maximum in
the measured εads″ spectra for K-doped PTCDA films in Figure 2. Indeed, the oscillator strength
associated with this peak is almost an order of magnitude smaller
than that of the LUMO to LUMO+2 excitation contributing to the main
maximum. Simulations on a cluster consisting of a PTCDA molecule asymmetrically
coordinated with two Na atoms yielded similar results (albeit with
modified indices for the orbitals and excited states due to the explicit
consideration of the dopants).48 We also
calculate the most prominent Raman-allowed vibrational mode of the
PTCDA dianion, which is at 0.20 eV. This is almost exactly the energy
by which the vibronic replicas are shifted from the main peaks in
the experimental spectra for the dianion on mica and for K4PTCDA/Ag(111) (see Figure 2). (iii) In the monoanion, the most prominent optical excitation
(again dominated by a LUMO → LUMO+2 transition) is somewhat
red-shifted compared to the neutral and dianion cases. This is reminiscent
of the situation of PTCDA on Ag(111) in the absence of the potassium
atoms. The calculated shift is, however, smaller than in the experiment.
Some deviations between simulations and experiments are not surprising
though, bearing in mind that upon adsorption on Ag(111) the PTCDA
LUMOs are more than half-filled (i.e., the actual situation goes beyond monoanion formation). Moreover,
on the surface the filling of the LUMO is partially compensated by
a back-transfer of charges from the carboxylic oxygens (vide
supra).49 None of these effects
are captured in the calculations of the isolated monoanion.

a As discussed in the main text,
H and L refer to the orbitals that have the same symmetry as the HOMO
and LUMO of the neutral molecule (consequently, L for the dianion
refers to the highest doubly occupied orbital), while L+1 and L+2
refer to the orbitals that have the same symmetry as the second and
third unoccupied orbital. Importantly, the orbitals with a certain
label have essentially the same shapes at different doping levels.
The subscripts α and β refer to the two spin manifolds.
There is no significant change in shape and, more importantly, no
change in their order.

b The
observation that the S1 and S3 coefficients
in the description of the excitations
in the neutral and dianion case appear to be 1/√2 smaller than
S2 for the anion is just a consequence of the fact that
for a spin-restricted calculation a normalization factor of 1/√2
is included in the description of the singlet state in the Gaussian
output. This is not the case for the spin-unrestricted calculation
of the anion. In the characterization of the excited states only transitions
with weights exceeding 0.13 are included.

Interestingly, all relevant optically allowed excited
states in
the neutral PTCDA molecule and the dianion (i.e., the systems most relevant for the present study) are
dominated by individual single-particle excitations. Therefore, the
properties of the excited states can be immediately associated with
those of specific orbitals. The observation that the absolute values
of the Kohn–Sham orbital gaps are much smaller than the excited-state
energies can be traced back to the self-interaction error50 and lack of the derivative discontinuity in
(semi)local functionals and has no bearing on the qualitative conclusions
drawn here. What is important are the observed trends. For example,
the HOMO → LUMO gap in the neutral PTCDA molecule (also reported
in Table 2) is only
0.07 eV smaller than the LUMO → LUMO+2 gap in the dianion,
which is fully consistent with an energetic difference of 0.08 eV
between the respective states (S1 for the neutral molecule
and S3 for the dianion).

To link these results to
the calculated densities of states discussed
in the previous section, it is worth pointing out that several trends
observed in the band-structure calculations of the interfaces (Figure 3) are directly reflected
in the shifts of molecular orbital energies (Table S1) (recalling that PTCDA is negatively charged by Ag(111)
even without K): The HOMO → LUMO gap is strongly reduced upon
charging both in the interface simulations and in the molecular calculations.
Conversely, the LUMO+1 → LUMO+2 splitting increases upon K
doping on the surface and likewise upon charging the individual molecules
(cf., Figure 3 and Table S1). These correlations
indicate that trends derived from single-particle densities of states
of extended interfaces can be directly correlated with excitation
processes within the PTCDA adsorbate layer. Consequently, it is also
useful to calculate optical spectra (within the independent particle
approximation) from the bands of the extended interfaces taking the
hybridization of the molecular and substrate states into account.

The corresponding spectra obtained within the independent particle
random phase approximation (IP-RPA) are shown in Figure 4. The displayed dielectric
function of the adsorbed monolayer is computed as51 1  where Δεsc″ = εsc,KxPTCDA/Ag(111)″ – εsc,Ag(111)″ is the change
in the dielectric function of the supercell upon adding KxPTCDA to the Ag surface; dsc is the height of the supercell used in simulations in the direction
perpendicular to the surface (slab thickness + vacuum region), and dML is the thickness of the adsorbed monolayer
(estimated to be 3.25 Å on the basis of the bulk density of PTCDA52). One observes that the energies of the maxima
in Figure 4 correspond
to energetic splittings of the DOS peaks in Figure 3 for exactly those orbitals that most strongly
contribute to the description of the excited states (cf., Table 2). For example,
the maximum for the doped films at about 1.55 eV corresponds to the
energy difference of the LUMO- and LUMO+2-derived bands in the corresponding
DOS, which also amounts to 1.55 eV. This confirms the above interpretation
of the spectra and enables us to address the impact of hybridization
with the substrate: In the calculations, the spectrum of PTCDA/Ag(111)
(black curve in Figure 4) is characterized by a peak at 1.4 eV (1.75 eV in the experiments, Figure 2a). This peak narrows
and shifts to higher energy for K2PTCDA/Ag(111) (red curve
in Figure 4). Both
trends are consistent with the experimental observations (see Figure 2a) and prevail for
K4PTCDA/Ag(111) with a slightly larger shift of the main
feature (see blue curve in Figure 4). Also the experimentally observed splitting into
a weaker low-energy feature and a stronger high-energy feature for
K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) is reproduced
in the simulations. In passing we note that a fully quantitative agreement
between theory and experiments is not expected within the independent
particle approximation, and also the vibronic fine-structure observed
in the experiments is not contained in simulations focusing on electronic
excitations.

Figure 4 Imaginary part of the dielectric function for extended
PTCDA/Ag(111),
K2PTCDA/Ag(111), and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) interfaces
calculated from the band structures employing the independent particle
random phase approximation (IP-RPA). A Lorentzian broadening of 0.14
eV (FWHM) is applied to the plotted data.

The decreasing line width of the spectral features after
K doping
can be directly traced back to the decreasing line widths of the relevant
DOS peaks discussed in the previous section. The most relevant bands
in this context are the ones derived from the molecular LUMO and LUMO+2
for the main peak and, additionally, the LUMO+1-derived band for the
low-energy tail of the main feature.

These considerations allow
us to unambiguously associate the DR
spectra at various K-doping stages with specific charging states of
the adsorbate layer. Particularly, they show that the similar peak
positions for K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and PTCDA/Au(111) are a coincidence
rather than an indication for a reduction of the charge of the PTCDA
layer due to K deposition. The reduced width of the spectral features
upon K doping is an indication for a reduced coupling to the substrate,28 an aspect that shall be addressed more thoroughly
in the following sections.

Coupling between the PTCDA Layer and the
Ag(111) Substrate at
Various Stages of K-Doping: Band Structures and Adsorption Heights
Given that optical transitions do not mix states with different k-vectors, studying the actual band structures of the interfaces
provides insight beyond merely considering the densities of states.
The calculated bands for PTCDA/Ag(111), K2PTCDA/Ag(111),
and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) are shown as thin lines in Figure 5. Superimposed is
a k-resolved density of states projected onto atom-centered
functions of the molecules (KDOS(k, E)),53,54 in anaology to the evaluation of Löwdin
charges.55 That quantity is highest for
(k, E) values corresponding to states
localized in the molecular regions; that is, it allows us to identify
molecular contributions to the actual band structure. The KDOS could
also be plotted by coloring each point in the band structure depending
on the square of the wave function amplitude in the molecular region
of the adsorbate layer.56,57 This would, however,
generate a somewhat involved picture considering the fairly large
number of bands due to using a slab of a finite thickness to represent
the metal substrate. This complication can be avoided by representing
the KDOS in Figure 5 as a color map adopting a Gaussian broadening for each state using
a width of 0.11 eV, i.e., the same
broadening that was applied when plotting the DOS in Figure 3 (for details see Methods section).

Figure 5 Band structure for (a) PTCDA/Ag(111),
(b) K2PTCDA/Ag(111),
and (c) K4PTCDA/Ag(111). The k-resolved
DOS (KDOS(k, E)) (for details see
main text and Methods section) projected onto
the molecular region is superimposed as an intensity plot to show
the contributions from PTCDA molecular orbitals. Note the different
energy ranges, to follow the energy shift of the PTCDA orbitals with
K doping (the total width of the displayed energy range is the same
in all panels). The color scale for the KDOS is normalized to the
maximum value for a nondegenerate state fully localized on the molecule
(see Methods section).

For PTCDA/Ag(111) one observes a massive energetic broadening
of
the PTCDA-derived LUMO (somewhat below EF), LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 states. This is indicative of the strong hybridization
with substrate states at virtually all k-points of
the surface Brillouin zone. The hybridization is superimposed with
a significant dispersion of the main features (red and yellow regions)
of the bands, with the combination of both effects giving rise to
the large width of the DOS features. For K2PTCDA, the dominant
KDOS features are much more clearly resolved in energy (see the increase
in red regions in panel (b) compared to panel (a)). Note also the
reduced energetic broadening indicating a reduced hybridization with
the substrate. In K4PTCDA/Ag(111), the molecule-derived
bands become essentially flat, with the effect being most pronounced
for the LUMO+1- and LUMO+2-derived states. This explains why in this
system especially the LUMO+1- and LUMO+2-derived DOS peaks are well
resolved and clearly separated (see also Figure 3). All these results confirm the reduced
interaction between PTCDA and Ag due to K doping.

A difference
in molecule–metal interaction should also be
reflected in the vertical adsorption geometry of the adsorbate layer
and, particularly, in the adsorption heights of the individual atomic
species of the K2PTCDA structure. The latter can be determined
by NIXSW experiments with very high precision and chemical sensitivity.58,59 Details of the NIXSW experiments and the data analysis are discussed
in the Methods section and the Supporting Information. The key results are illustrated
in a structural model of the vertical adsorption geometry in Figure 6 together with the
respective calculated values. All experimentally and theoretically
determined adsorption heights for K2PTCDA, K4PTCDA, and literature data for PTCDA/Ag(111)60,61 are summarized in Table 3.

data from ref (61) in

a All values are given relative
to the (hypothetical) unrelaxed Ag(111) surface, as this is the quantity
measured in X-ray standing wave experiments. Additionally, in parentheses
we report the calculated distances relative to the relaxed top Ag
layer. The values given in parentheses along with the measured adsorption
heights are the experimental uncertainties. Cpery denotes
the C atoms in the perylene core, Cfunc are those attached
to the O atoms, Oanhy denotes the anhydride oxygens, Ocarb are the carboxylic oxygens, and K are the potassium atoms.
The adsorption heights of the hydrogen atoms were not measured.

b These distances are ca. 0.1 Å smaller than the ones reported in ref (62). This is mostly due to
the fact that we here considered a five-layer Ag slab in which the
two top layers were relaxed, while in ref (62) only three layers were considered, where just
one was allowed to change its position during geometry relaxation.
When repeating our geometry optimizations with that reduced-size model
system, deviations between our calculations and those in ref (62) are at the most 0.04 Å;
thus, the main reduction can be explained by a modified relaxation
of the Ag surface.

c Taken
from ref (61); see
also ref (60).

Before discussing the resulting
model in detail, it is worthwhile
mentioning that measured and calculated heights match well. When comparing
the numbers, a general observation is that the calculated adsorption
heights are consistently slightly smaller than the experimental ones.
We attribute this at least in part to an inaccurate description of
the vertical relaxation of the topmost Ag layer, which for K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) also arise from the
modifications we had to make to the lattice constants to reconcile
the point-on-line growth with periodic boundary conditions (see ref (19) and the Methods section). This Ag relaxation is indeed relevant here,
as the true interaction is determined by the actual interatomic distances,
while the quantities measured in NIXSW are the distances relative
to the lattice planes of the Bragg reflection used, i.e., effectively relative to the (hypothetical)
unrelaxed Ag(111) surface. An incorrectly modeled surface relaxation
will, therefore, cause minor deviations between measured and calculated
heights. Only for the K atoms do the deviations appear too large to
arise from such effects. To test to what extent the very high experimental
K position is a consequence of varying K-adsorption positions arising
from point-on-line growth,
we compared K atoms adsorbed on top and in hollow positions as the
two limiting cases. There we, however, found differences in adsorption
heights of only 0.02 Å. Another reason for the deviations could
be that the adsorption heights measured for K2PTCDA might
be slightly influenced by a small amount of coexisting K4PTCDA (see Supporting Information for
more details) in such a way that the obtained values are systematically
too large (cf. Table 3).

Independent of the above-mentioned deviations,
the trends in the
main geometrical changes upon K doping are consistent for simulations
and experiments: (i) K deposition clearly increases the adsorption height of the perylene core of PTCDA above the Ag
substrate, which again suggests a weakening of the coupling between
the substrate and the adsorbate layer. (ii) While for PTCDA/Ag(111)
especially the carboxylic oxygens bend toward the
surface indicative of an additional bonding channel to the Ag substrate,
upon K doping they are found at positions significantly above the perylene carbons. Interestingly, the anhydride oxygens also
bend away from the surface upon K doping such that they come to lie
above the K atoms. Note that the adsorption heights of the oxygen
atoms are quantitatively the same for both oxygen species, but the
differences in adsorption heights between Oanhy and Ocarb are significantly smaller than in the case of PTCDA/Ag(111).
The reasons for the upward bending will become apparent when analyzing
the interfacial charge rearrangements (vide infra). Upon increasing the K concentration (i.e., for the K4PTCDA/Ag(111) system), all K-induced
geometrical changes are enhanced in the calculations (no experiments
are available for that doping stage).

In passing we note that
the rather strong lifting of the perylene
core away from the Ag surface upon K doping is in sharp contrast to
the situation observed upon exposing the PTCDA/Ag(110) interface to
K atoms, where the measured adsorption height increases by only 0.05
Å.42 We attribute that difference
to a significantly altered bonding geometry, as on Ag(110) the K atoms
lie below the PTCDA molecules replacing Ag atoms
in the topmost surface layer, while in the present case they lie above the top Ag layer.19 The
latter results in a distinct upward bending of the carboxylic oxygens
so that they lie 0.24 Å (0.31 Å) above the perylene core
in the NIXSW experiments (DFT calculations). Importantly, the decoupling
of the PTCDA molecules from the substrate upon K deposition is not
a consequence of any tilting of the molecule, as has been observed
when subjecting a 6P monolayer on Cu(110) to Cs doping.21 This can be inferred from both the STM images19 and the high coherent fractions of the Cpery atoms (see Supporting Information) in the NIXSW experiments.

To determine to what extent the
reduced widths of the DOS features
in K2PTCDA/Ag(111) compared to PTCDA/Ag(111) are a consequence
of geometric deformations and to what extent they are caused by the
electronic interactions with the K atoms, we studied a model structure
with all atoms in the same coordinates as in K2PTCDA/Ag(111),
but removed K. The resulting band structure and DOS, as well as additional
intermediate models, are presented in the Supporting Information and testify that K atoms act both structurally
by raising the molecule and electronically by weakening PTCDA–Ag
and PTCDA–PTCDA interactions.

Charge Rearrangements
To better understand the interaction
of the PTCDA layer with the K atoms, it is useful to analyze charge
rearrangements, Δρ, upon K doping. Here it should be noted
that the purpose of the following gedanken experiment is not to mimic
the actual growth process, but rather to analyze the way charges are
redistributed due to the doping of K atoms into the PTCDA film on
Ag. Δρ is given by the difference of the charge densities
of the interacting system and the subsystems (all in the geometry
of KxPTCDA/Ag(111)): 2  Here, ρ(KxPTCDA/Ag(111)), ρ(PTCDA/Ag(111)),
and ρ(Kx) denote the charge densities
of the K-doped PTCDA
layer on Ag(111), the adsorbed system upon removing the K atoms, and
the removed K atoms, respectively. An alternative scenario, where
we first consider the formation of a hypothetical free-standing KxPTCDA layer, which eventually adsorbs on
the Ag(111) substrate, is discussed in the Supporting Information.

The charge rearrangements for the formation
of the PTCDA/Ag(111) interface (with a herringbone arrangement of
the molecules) have already been discussed extensively in the literature
(e.g., in ref (49)). There one primarily
observes an electron transfer into the π-electron system of
the PTCDA layer accompanied by an electron density reduction above
the metal and in the σ-electron system, with the latter effect
strongest in the region of the carboxylic oxygens. This is indicative
of the charge back-donation process described earlier. A similar situation
is obtained when arranging the molecules on Ag(111) in the geometry
they finally adapt in the K2PTCDA/Ag(111) layer (see Supporting Information).

When adding the
K atoms (cf., Figure 7a) to the adsorbed PTCDA layer,
one observes the additional donation of electrons into the π-system
of the PTCDA molecules especially in the molecular regions close to
the K atoms. This is consistent with a further filling of the LUMO
upon K doping. Additionally, one sees electron density accumulation
above the topmost Ag layer especially directly below the K atoms.
An interesting observation is that the most significant electron density
depletion is not centered at the K atoms but localized in the region
between them. This is also observed when potassium atoms are adsorbed
on the bare Ag(111) surface in the absence of the PTCDA layer (see Supporting Information). An additional feature
is the accumulation of electron density on top of the K atoms, which
is a common observation for K and heavier alkalis adsorbed on metals.63

by the magenta
arrow in the left panels) for the charge rearrangements occurring
upon K doping in the KxPTCDA/Ag(111) systems.

– ρ(PTCDA/Ag(111)) – ρ(K2); (b)
equivalent plots for K4PTCDA/Ag(111) (i.e., Δρ = ρ(K4PTCDA/Ag(111))
– ρ(PTCDA/Ag(111)) – ρ(K4)).
Red regions show electron accumulation, and blue regions show electron
depletion (isovalue = 0.002 e/Bohr3). The color code of
C, O, and H atoms corresponds to that in Figure 1, while Ag atoms are depicted in gray here.

Of particular interest are the
charge rearrangements in the immediate
vicinity of the oxygen atoms: There is electron density accumulation
between both the carboxylic and anhydride oxygens and the K atoms.
Concomitantly, electron density is depleted between the oxygens and
the neighboring carbon atoms. This is indicative of a modification
of the bonding situation of the oxygens with a weakening of the bonds
to the backbone of the PTCDA molecules and an interaction with the
K atoms that goes clearly beyond a mere charge transfer. This observation
reinforces the above conclusion that the direct chemical interaction
between the anhydride groups of the PTCDA molecules and the K atoms
plays a crucial role for the reduced coupling between PTCDA and Ag(111)
upon K doping. Similar trends, albeit with more massive charge rearrangements,
are also seen for the K4PTCDA system (see Figure 7b).

As a final remark,
we briefly mention work function changes, as
a direct consequence of the charge rearrangements (especially those
perpendicular to the metal surface). They are significant, as shown
in Table 4 with K-doping
triggering a work-function change of up to −1.6 eV. Notably,
also for this observable, we obtain an excellent agreement between
experiments and simulations, which supports the validity of the calculated
charge rearrangements discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this
section.

Measured and Simulated Work-Function Changes with Respect to the Bare
Substrate, ΔΦAg(111), and Relative to Undoped

a A complication
in the experiments
is that the surface coverage is incomplete (d = 0.7
ML). In order to allow for a better comparison to the simulated values,
the measured work-function changes were, thus, extrapolated to monolayer
coverage (by dividing by 0.7). The overall agreement is excellent,
although a significant amount of K not interacting with PTCDA may
exist on the samples particularly in the K4PTCDA film.

Conclusions
The
combination of the results from various complementary experimental
and theoretical investigations shows that for the prototypical PTCDA/Ag(111)
interface extensive geometrical reorderings occur upon potassium doping,
which in turn result in massive modifications of the electronic and
optical properties of the interface. In particular, K-deposition increases
the net electronic charge of the PTCDA molecules, which results in
a transition from a metallic to a semiconducting adsorbate layer.
This behavior is in sharp contrast to the impact of (degenerate) doping
in conventional semiconductors, where doping generates a highly conducting
state.

Moreover, K deposition reduces the electronic coupling
between
the PTCDA layer and the Ag substrate. In the simulations, this is
manifested in a reduction of the intrinsic widths of the DOS features
associated with the adsorbate layer and a decreased dispersion and
hybridization of the adsorbate-projected bands. In the experiments
it gives rise to sharper spectral features upon increasing the K content
in conjunction with an increasing adsorption distance of the perylene
core and a pronounced upward-bending of the carboxylic O atoms. This
implies that the strength of the electronic coupling between the molecules
and the substrate can be tuned by the potassium dopants. Notably,
in spite of the new K–O bonding channels and the associated
massive charge rearrangements, we do not observe a stronger dispersion
of the bands for k-vectors parallel to the substrate
surface.

On more technical grounds we find that the observation
that the
main peak of the DRS spectrum of K2PTCDA/Ag(111) is found
at essentially the same position as the dominant peak in the spectrum
of PTCDA/Au(111) is not a consequence of an actual chemical similarity
between the two situations. Rather it is a mere coincidence arising
from the specific positions of the unoccupied orbitals of PTCDA. This
shows that such comparisons can be very misleading for complex surfaces
and that, for situations as involved as the present one, only the
combination of a manifold of complementary experimental techniques
with state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations allows a consistent,
in-depth atomistic understanding of the actual situation. This understanding
is, however, a vital requirement for a future rational design of complex
metal–organic interfaces.

Methods
Sample
Preparation
The Ag(111) substrate was prepared
by repeated Ar+-sputtering and annealing cycles according
to ref (64). Each substrate
preparation was checked by means of low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) prior to film deposition. The molecules were deposited under
ultra-high-vacuum conditions (base pressure 10–10 mbar) from effusion cells with temperature-stabilized (±1 K)
crucibles. The deposition rates were on the order of 0.1 ML per minute.
The starting point of each doping experiment was a submonolayer of
PTCDA on Ag(111) with a coverage of 0.6 to 0.7 ML. Potassium was subsequently
deposited from a commercially available dispenser source (SAES Getters
and Alvatec), while the substrate was kept at room temperature. The
evolution of the phases was followed by in situ optical
spectroscopy and by distortion-corrected LEED experiments to ensure
that the above-mentioned PTCDA/Ag(111), K2PTCDA/Ag(111),
and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) phases are the only (ordered) ones
that occur on the sample.19

In
Situ Optical Spectroscopy
From
the DRS raw data, shown in the Supporting Information, the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the adsorbate
layer εads″ was extracted by applying the following expression:28  Here, εsub′ and εsub″ are the
real and imaginary
parts of the dielectric function of the bulk substrate. This approximation
is valid for film thicknesses d much smaller than
the photon wavelengths λ and under the condition that |εsub″| ≪
|1 – εsub′| holds (which is fulfilled for silver in the wavelength
range considered here).65R(0) denotes the reference reflectance of the pristine Ag(111) substrate,
while R(d) stands for the reflectance
measured as a function of the effective PTCDA film thickness d. For the subsequent K doping R and hence
ε″ change as a function of the number of adsorbed K atoms,
which itself is assumed to scale linearly with deposition time. For
DRS, an actively cooled 100 W halogen lamp (Osram Xenophot) was operated
with a stabilized power supply (Voltcraft HPS-11530). The reflected
light was spectrally analyzed by means of a monochromator (Acton Research
SpectraPro SP2356) with a charge-coupled device attached (Princeton
Instruments Spec-10 100BR, liquid-nitrogen-cooled CCD).

Photoelectron
Spectroscopy Experiments
XPS and UPS
measurements were performed in Jena using a FOCUS 500 monochromatized
X-ray (Al Kα emission) and a monochromatized UV light source
UVLS (He Iα emission) combined with a toroidal-mirror monochromator
TMM 304. The photoelectrons were analyzed using a PHOIBOS 150 hemispherical
energy analyzer with a 3D-DLD detector attached. All parts were supplied
by SPECS. The acceptance angle of the detector is ±7°. The
Fermi edge region has been fitted by a convolution of the Fermi–Dirac
function with a Gaussian representing the instrumental resolution,
which was thereby estimated to be ∼50 meV. For the determination
of work functions, secondary electron cut-offs were measured with
the sample biased at ca. −9 V. The UP spectra
were recorded at normal emission. The PTCDA on Ag(111) samples were
transferred to the photoelectron spectroscopy setup prior to the potassium
deposition using an ultra-high-vacuum shuttle with a base pressure
of 10–10 mbar.

Normal Incidence X-ray
Standing Wave Experiments
NIXSW
experiments utilize the standing wave that forms by the interference
of an incident X-ray beam with an outgoing beam that is Bragg diffracted
by a single crystal (the substrate). Scanning the photon energy through
the Bragg condition shifts the nodes and antinodes of the standing
wave in the direction perpendicular to the Bragg planes (in our experiment
we use the (111) Bragg planes, which are aligned with the sample surface).
This changes the amplitude of the X-ray field at the positions of
a specific atomic species in a way that is characteristic for the
(vertical) position of that atomic species relative to the nearest
Bragg plane. These intensity profiles are parametrized by the coherent
fraction FH and coherent position PH through  The so-called yield, Y, is
the intensity of the standing wave field at the species of interest,
normalized by the intensity of the incoming beam. EPh is the photon energy of the incoming beam, and R(EPh) and
ν(EPh) are the
reflectivity of the sample and the phase of the standing wave field
at this energy, respectively. Since R(EPh) and ν(EPh) follow
from the dynamic theory of diffraction, the Eph-dependence of Y is purely determined by
the parameters FH and PH, which thus can
be obtained by fitting the above equation to experimentally obtained
yield curves. These two parameters can then directly be linked to
the geometric structure of the sample, since PH represents the average position of the studied species relative
to the nearest Bragg plane, in units of the Bragg spacing. The second
parameter, FH, indicates how well-ordered
the species is, with a value of 1 meaning that all atoms of this species
lie at precisely the same distance from the nearest Bragg plane and
a value of 0 typically indicating complete disorder.

In this
work, the amplitude of the X-ray interference field at the atomic
species of interest was tracked by recording XPS spectra of the C
1s, O 1s, and K 2p photoemission signals as the incident beam energy
was scanned through the Bragg condition. Subsequently, these XPS spectra
were analyzed with core level models to obtain the yield profiles
of individual chemical species using CasaXPS 2.3.16 PR 1.6. The fits
of the yield curves were performed by means of TORRICELLI. All measurements
were performed at beamline I09 of the Diamond Light Source, using
a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer mounted at 90° relative to
the incoming X-ray beam. Since in this geometry, nondipolar effects
are expected to be minimal, no correction for nondipolar effects has
been applied. The films were carefully checked for radiation damage
prior to and after each XSW scan. Significant degradation can be excluded
at least on the time scale of the experiments. For a more elaborate
explanation of the experimental procedure, used core-level models,
and the results of this NIXSW analysis refer to the Supporting Information.

Density-Functional Theory
Calculations
The optimized
adsorption geometries were obtained in our previous work19 by means of DFT calculations using the Vienna ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)66 in conjunction with GADGET.67 The GGA
functional as proposed by Purdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)68 was employed and the van der Waals interactions
were included as described by the vdWsurf method.62

A complication arising from the experimentally
observed point-on-line growth is that such a situation is a priori not compatible with the required periodic boundary
conditions. This problem can, however, be fixed by choosing suitable
supercells in combination with a minute deformation of the substrate
(see Figure 1), which
for the present system has been tested to have little impact on the
obtained results.19 Consequently, while
constructing the supercells for K2PTCDA/Ag(111) and K4PTCDA/Ag(111) we decided to keep the distances between molecules
at the values measured with high-resolution scanning tunneling hydrogen
microscopy (STHM) and distortion-corrected LEED and instead slightly
changed the Ag lattice constants in order to arrive at unit cells
for which the epitaxy matrix contains only integer entries.19 For PTCDA/Ag(111), since the monolayer was commensurate
with the substrate in the experiments,22 the PBE lattice constant was used. All slabs consisted of five layers
of atoms, where the top two layers were allowed to relax. Please refer
to ref (19) for more
details of the geometrical optimization.

The structures obtained
from VASP were further analyzed using the
Quantum ESPRESSO suite,69 where ultrasoft
pseudopotentials generated with the Rappe, Rabe, Kaxiras, and Joannopoulos
scheme70 were used with a plane-wave cutoff
of 367.35 eV (27 Ry). The density of states was calculated with Gaussian
broadenings of 0.11 and 0.02 eV (FWHM) for PTCDA/Ag(111), K2PTCDA/Ag(111), and K4PTCDA/Ag(111), by using off-Γ
Monkhorst–Pack k-points grids71 of 6 × 6 × 1, 10 × 6 × 1, and 6 ×
6 × 1, respectively. While analyzing the band structure (see Figure 5), in order to identify
the molecular contributions to the fairly large number of bands depicted
as thin lines, we superimposed a k-resolved density
of states (KDOS) projected onto the atomic states belonging to the
molecule: KDOS(k, E) = ∑ϕ∈mol∑n|⟨ϕ|ψnk⟩|2δ(E – ϵnk); ϕ are the
atom-centered functions used for the Löwdin projections, the
sum runs over the atoms of a molecule and ψnk and ϵnk are the Kohn–Sham
eigenstates and eigenvalues, respectively. An additional summation
over k in the surface Brillouin zone produces the
molecular DOS shown in Figure 3. Analyzing the KDOS is conceptually equivalent to plotting
the bands with colors depending on the amplitude on a specific portion
of the system,56,57 but it allows us to analyze cases
characterized by dense bands (or even energy continua; see ref (72) for an example). In practice,
the δ-function in the above equation was replaced by a Gaussian
with the same width as used when plotting the DOS (0.11 eV FWHM);
since absolute values of the KDOS depend on the broadening, we normalize
it to the maximum value assumed by the broadening function (8.3/eV
× 2 for spin multiplicity) so that a nondegenerate state ψnk fully belonging to the molecule has a maximum
KDOS(k, E) = 1. Figures 1 and 7 have been produced by using the program XCrySDen.73

In order to calculate the optical absorption spectra
of Figure 4 we adopted
the Yambo
software74 to evaluate the independent
particle response from PBE Kohn–Sham orbitals.75 Since Yambo can handle neither ultrasoft pseudopotentials
nor PAW potentials, additional calculations of the electronic ground
state were performed as a preliminary step using the same atomic positions
and k-point meshes, but norm-conserving pseudopotentials
(requiring a higher cutoff of around 680 eV). We included the empty
states in an energy range up to 10 eV above the Fermi energy.

The simulations of individual molecules employing open boundary
conditions were conducted using Gaussian09, revision D.01,76 employing PBE exchange and correlation and a
6-311G(d,p)77 basis set. Geometries were
optimized using standard convergence criteria, and excited-state properties
were obtained employing TD-DFT using the same functional and the ground-state
geometries.78

Finally, we note that
in Figure 3 we observe
even a quantitative agreement between calculated
Kohn–Sham energies and measured ionization energies. While
semilocal DFT is typically capable of correctly describing trends,
this quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is somewhat
surprising considering that when solely considering Kohn–Sham
orbital energies one suffers from self-interaction errors and from
the fact that screening effects at the surface are neglected. Still,
a quantitative agreement between Kohn–Sham orbital energies
and UPS features is not uncommon,79 and
we attribute that at least in part to a fortuitous cancellation of
the above-mentioned errors for flat-lying adsorbates.
