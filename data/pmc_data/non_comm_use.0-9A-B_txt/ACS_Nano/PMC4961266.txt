In vivo, mammalian cells proliferate within 3D
environments consisting of numerous microcavities and channels, which
contain a variety of chemical and physical cues. External environments
often differ between normal and pathological states, such as the unique
spatial constraints that metastasizing cancer cells experience as
they circulate the vasculature through arterioles and narrow capillaries,
where they can divide and acquire elongated cylindrical shapes. While
metastatic tumors cause most cancer deaths, factors impacting early
cancer cell proliferation inside the vasculature and those that can
promote the formation of secondary tumors remain largely unknown.
Prior studies investigating confined mitosis have mainly used 2D cell
culture systems. Here, we mimic aspects of metastasizing tumor cells
dividing inside blood capillaries by investigating single-cell divisions
of living human cancer cells, trapped inside 3D rolled-up, transparent
nanomembranes. We assess the molecular effects of tubular confinement
on key mitotic features, using optical high- and super-resolution
microscopy. Our experiments show that tubular confinement affects
the morphology and dynamics of the mitotic spindle, chromosome arrangements,
and the organization of the cell cortex. Moreover, we reveal that
membrane blebbing and/or associated processes act as a potential genome-safety
mechanism, limiting the extent of genomic instability caused by mitosis
in confined circumstances, especially in tubular 3D microenvironments.
Collectively, our study demonstrates the potential of rolled-up nanomembranes
for gaining molecular insights into key cellular events occurring
in tubular 3D microenvironments in vivo.

==== Body
Cancer cells,
originating from
primary lesions can invade adjacent tissues and squeeze along muscle
fibers,1 before entering the vascular system
and traveling to distal sites, where some of them can proliferate
and form metastases. During this process cancer cells can become trapped
inside narrow blood capillaries2−5 (Figure 1A), where they adapt to the tubular confinement by elongating
into cylindrical shapes6 (Figure 1A and B). Importantly, several in vivo studies have shown that circulating tumor cells
can divide under such tubular confinements and form early micrometastatic
colonies before exiting the vasculature.2,3 This intravascular
proliferation in tubular environments is thought to be a critical
step during metastasis, at least in the lung and the liver.2,3,7−9 Despite the
leading role of metastasis in cancer mortality, many steps during
this process remain poorly understood. This is due to metastasis being
a rare—but often destructive—process that happens in
parts of the body not easily accessible to molecular analyses, such
as the vascular or ductal system. Gaining molecular insights into
how 3D, and in particular tubular, constraints affect the division
of human cancer cells might therefore lead to a better understanding
of the events and factors that promote metastasis, which in the future
could help improve antimetastatic cancer treatments.

Cell division, the partitioning of the nucleus
(mitosis) followed
by the division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis), involves striking
3D changes in the cell’s geometry and cytoskeleton. For instance,
most dividing eukaryotic cells restructure their interphase actin
structures,10 resulting in the recruitment
of actin filaments to the cell cortex,11 thereby imparting a heightened stiffness to mitotic cells.12,13 This increased rigidity is usually accompanied by conspicuous changes
in mitotic cell shape, whereby the cells abandon their flattened and
spread-out interphase morphologies on planar substrates to take up
rounded-up sphere-like shapes.14,15 The cell cortex is
then further remodeled to generate a contractile actomyosin ring that
is tightly coupled to the plasma membrane11 and enables cytokinesis.16

Mitotic
rearrangements of the cortex are accompanied by, and tightly
linked to, the remodeling of the interphase microtubule network into
a bipolar spindle, which itself possesses an intricate 3D architecture.
Dedicated motor-protein activities functioning along microtubules
help to provide the vectorial forces required to push/pull the duplicated
centrosomes apart, allowing the centrosomes to migrate along various
3D trajectories to opposite cell poles. This process occurs in a tightly
controlled temporal manner and generates a mature prometa-/metaphase
spindle with extremely well-defined geometric dimensions.17−19 A ring-like arrangement of chromosomes then forms at the nascent
spindle, facilitating bipolar attachment of microtubules to the chromosomes’
kinetochores and, thus, enabling faithful chromosome segregation and
maintaining genomic stability.17 Notably,
genomic instability can lead to cancer as well as other diseases,20,21 highlighting the importance of genome-protective mechanisms for
human health.

Mitotic progression is highly sensitive to external
physical influences,
such as spatial stimuli and geometric constraints.22−24 Indeed, by
remodeling the actin cortex lying at the interface between an animal
cell and its environment, mitotic cells can translate geometric aspects
of their microenvironment into spatial information that determines
the fate of their daughter cells. For instance, the pattern of cell
adhesion can dictate the orientation of the spindle and thus, the
positions of the two arising daughter cells.22,24 Moreover, preventing mitotic cell rounding by planar compression
in one dimension from the top/bottom can cause mitotic delays, multipolar
spindles, and defects in chromosome segregation.14,25 In addition, changes in spindle architecture caused by external
forces26 can impair the stability of the
bipolar spindle and the positioning of the cell division plane.14

Collectively, the above findings illustrate
tight connections between
the cortical cytoskeleton and spindle microtubules and the highly
mechanosensitive nature of cell division. However, prior studies were
mainly performed on cells growing on flat surfaces that lack the geometric
attributes of the highly curved substrates and tubular confinements
cells experience inside the body, such as kidney tubules, mammary
ducts, gut villi, vessels, muscle fibers, and bone tissue. Despite
the in vivo relevance of these microenvironments,
only few in vitro models have been developed to mimic
the geometry of such structures, for instance, the ducts and acini
of mammary glands.27 Importantly, recent
evidence has emerged indicating that cells under tubular confinement
elicit distinct mitotic responses to external spatial stimuli that
are different compared to those of spatially confined cells growing
on planar substrates.28 Investigating these
responses at a molecular level is therefore crucial to understand
better how the physical parameters of different 3D surroundings, such
as the tubular confinement of cancer cells inside blood capillaries
(Figure 1B), might
dictate mitotic cell behavior and function.

To address this
challenge, we have developed and used rolled-up
SiO/SiO2 nanofilms to encapsulate live, individual human
cancer cells (HeLa cells) inside transparent microtubes28−30 (Figure 1C). This
tubular nanomembrane system offers a way of mimicking aspects of the in vivo 3D microenvironments certain cancer cells encounter
during metastasis. The behavior of the entrapped cells can then be
analyzed conveniently with high- and super-resolution microscopy.
Moreover, due to the on-chip nature of the platform, numerous cells
can be imaged in a single experiment. Other systems, such as microfluidic
devices, either have complex macro-to-micro interfaces, introduce
contamination via oil molecules, have rectangular
rather than circular channels, or cannot be implemented in an easily
visualizable chip-based format.31−33

In this study, we show
that tubular confinement has a profound
impact on a wide range of mitotic features, and we provide an in-depth
characterization of these features at a molecular level by using confocal
and super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D SIM).
Thus, we observed deformation of chromosome rosettes into densely
packed and disordered shapes and show that tubular confinement influences
the kinetics of spindle formation. In addition, consistent with the
link between the mitotic spindle and the cell cortex, we discover
a striking bipolar redistribution of cortex proteins that occurs specifically
in mitotic cells dividing inside nanomembrane tubes. This redistribution
coincides with conspicuous membrane blebbing that occurs at the actin-
and cortactin-enriched cell tips throughout mitosis. Finally, we establish
that membrane blebbing and/or associated processes can act as a potential
genome-safety mechanism that becomes functionally important under
certain spatial confinements. Based on our findings, we discuss the
potential of our platform for uncovering cellular pathways relevant
for cells dividing in certain 3D microenvironments. These advances
might help provide a better understanding of the molecular events
happening, for instance, during early intravascular proliferation
of circulating tumor cells.

Results and Discussion
Tubular Confinement Impacts
on Mitotic Cell Rounding, Spindle
Morphology, and Chromosome Arrangements
To gain insights
into how spatial confinement influences key mitotic features of cells
dividing in 3D contexts, we fabricated arrays of on-chip microtubes,
inside which individual proliferating human cells, such as HeLa cells,
can be entrapped and cultured28 (Figure 1C). Briefly, SiO/SiO2 nanobilayers of 25–100 nm thickness were deposited
on a transparent substrate patterned with 100 × 100 μm
square-shaped sacrificial layers. After selective etching away of
the sacrificial layers, the SiO/SiO2 nanobilayers were
self-folded into microtubes in on-chip format with a density of ∼500
microtubes per 1 cm2 chip area.34−36 The diameters
of microtubes are highly defined and tunable.30 We used 7–21 μm microtubes in our initial experiments,
because 7 μm represents about one-third of the diameter of rounded-up
human HeLa cells (∼20 μm) and because we found that nanomembrane
tubes of this size are the smallest tubes that HeLa cells can be entrapped
in (not shown). By contrast, tubes with diameters above 21 μm
do not impose any spatial confinement on mitotic HeLa cells, as they
are larger than the rounded-up diameter of HeLa cells during mitosis.
The surfaces of the microtubes were functionalized with fibronectin
to mimic aspects of the chemical microenvironment of mammalian cells in vivo. We then co-cultured HeLa cells with the nanomembrane
arrays overnight, allowing the cells to spontaneously migrate into
the tubular nanomembranes.28 Finally, we
analyzed cells entrapped inside the tubes with high-resolution fluorescence
microscopy (confocal microscopy) and/or super-resolution 3D SIM. As
described below, these techniques allowed us to gain insights into
key processes occurring during single-cell division under tubular
confinement.

The rolled-up nanomembrane configuration enables
tubular 2D-confinement of 3D cultured mitotic human cells (Figure 1C). As such, the
nanomembrane platform is fundamentally different from previous 1D-confined
(from top and bottom) experimental set-ups based on cells cultured
on 2D/planar surfaces14,25 (Supplementary Figure 1). We observed that confinement inside tubular nanomembranes
prevented cells from rounding up during mitosis. Instead, cells adopted
elongated cylindrical shapes, as illustrated by the strong correlation
between the cell shape factor (ratio between the minor and major axes
of an ellipse fitted to the cell) and the microtube diameter (Figure 1D). We therefore
focused our subsequent analyses on microtube diameters ranging from
7 to 18 μm, the largest microtubes that induced significant
cell shape changes (Figure 1D). Significantly, this diameter range is comparable to the
widths of in vivo blood arterioles/capillaries present
in humans and other mammals.5,6,37 While blood capillaries readily allow passage of endogenous cells
of the vascular system, such as red blood cells (∼7 μm
in diameter), metastasizing cancer cells that are much larger in diameter
(∼20 μm) can get stuck due to size restriction.4,5 Importantly, cancer cells trapped inside the vascular system adapt
to the widths of blood capillaries in vivo,37 comparable to HeLa cells encapsulated by narrow
rolled-up nanomembranes. Thus, the extent of deformation of cancer
cells inside blood capillaries in living organisms matches well with
the changes in cell shape we observed inside rolled-up nanomembranes:
cell shape factors reached ∼0.08 in the very narrowest vascular
capillaries inside living mice,37 comparable
to the ∼0.10 cell shape values we determined for HeLa cells
inside 7–9 μm rolled-up nanomembranes (Figure 1D). Collectively, these findings
illustrate that the experimental conditions in our system are within
the range of tubular constrictions certain cells encounter in vivo.

To probe how tubular confinement affects
the mitotic machinery
in 3D cultured cells, we investigated how the obstruction of cell
rounding influences spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in
mitotic prometaphase and metaphase (named prometa-/metaphase henceforth).
Both spindle and chromosome alignments are geometrically demanding
features that are important for successful mitotic progression.11,38−40 For our experiments, we used HeLa cells stably co-expressing
the core histone H2B tagged with the fluorescent marker mCherry (H2B-mCherry)
and α-tubulin fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-tubulin).
This allowed us to simultaneously follow chromosome and spindle dynamics
by fluorescence microscopy together with morphological cell shape
changes (Figure 1E).
The acquired images revealed that tubular confinement often led to
misaligned chromosome plates and variations in the angles between
metaphase plates and spindle axes (Figure 1E). 3D chromosome reconstructions highlighted
a strong compression of prometaphase chromosome arrangements inside
microtubes below 13 μm in diameter (Figure 1F and Supplementary Movies 1−4). During early prometaphase,
unconfined HeLa cells dividing on planar surfaces outside of the microtubes
(named “free cells” henceforth) displayed typical chromosome
rosettes, ring-shaped chromosome formations of ∼10 μm
in diameter (extracted from our live- and fixed-cell observations).
The rosettes consistently formed at the surface of nascent spindles,
with the arms pointing outward and the centromeres inward toward the
spindle axis, in accord with previous reports17 (Figure 1F; Supplementary Figures 2A and B, left and Supplementary Movie 1). These rosettes are believed
to be crucial for timely establishment of bipolar kinetochore attachments
to opposite spindle poles, a process that relies on a functional prometaphase
spindle and is important for faithful sister chromatid segregation.17,41 Chromosomes captured from this ring by the microtubules are concentrated
to form a metaphase plate at an angle perpendicular to the long axis
of the spindle.17 Only when all kinetochores
are properly bioriented and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)
is satisfied, do cells enter anaphase, triggering a loss of sister
chromatid cohesion and the movement of sister chromatids to opposite
cell poles.42 By contrast, 3D reconstructions
of cells confined inside microtubes of <14 μm diameters did
not contain chromosome rosettes. Instead, their chromosomes exhibited
dense packaging into tilted plates lacking a central cavity (Figure 1F and Supplementary Movies 2−4). These effects were pronounced most strongly in nanomembrane
tubes narrower than 10 μm, the mean diameter of chromosome rosettes
in free HeLa cells. In those narrow microtubes, the prometaphase chromosome
arrangements appeared twisted and strongly elongated into “cloud-like”
structures (Figure 1F, Supplementary Figure 2B, right and Supplementary Movie 2).

Tubular Confinement Impacts
on the Dynamics of Centrosome Separation
Chromosome rosettes
are important for the timely formation of bipolar
prometa-/metaphase spindles.17 Thus, we
wondered whether tubular confinement impacts on the kinetics of spindle
formation. To address this question, we took advantage of a Fiji plugin
(http://fiji.sc; Fiji is an open source software that is
a bundled version of Image J) to automatically monitor the 3D motion
of centrosomes during mitosis, using GFP-tagged centrin1 as a marker
(centrin1-GFP; Figure 2A, Supplementary Figures 3A and B and Supplementary Movies 5 and 6). The evolution of spindle length—the distance between
the two centrosomes—revealed three distinct phases during mitosis
(I–III; Supplementary Figure 3C). This allowed us to determine the timing of the transition from
an elongating nascent spindle to a prometa-/metaphase spindle, which
is fairly constant in length (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 3C). The ①s with arrows indicate the times at which full separation
of the centrosomes is achieved in prometa-/metaphase i.e., when a mature prometa-/metaphase spindle has
formed (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 3C). Moreover, the data
indicated the timing for initiation of the final elongation phase
of the spindle during anaphase (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 3C, time points indicated with ②). We found that tubular confinement
prolonged the formation of prometa-/metaphase spindles from 10.3 ±
0.8 min in free cells (black ①, Figure 2B) around 3-fold to 32.3 ± 2.1 min in
cells dividing inside narrow microtubes below 10 μm (red ①, Figure 2B). We detected an
intermediate, around 2-fold, delay to 20.0 ± 5.0 min in cells
dividing inside microtubes between 10 and 12 μm (Supplementary Figures 3C and D, time points
indicated with ①).

during spindle formation and leads to abnormally elongated prometa-/metaphase
spindles. (A) Time-lapse z-stack projections of a

a mature prometa-/metaphase spindle has formed (black ①: 10.3

for cells in 7–9 μm microtubes). The onset of anaphase
spindle elongation is marked by a black and red ② for free
cells and cells confined in 7–9 μm microtubes, respectively.
In each case, the experiment was repeated at least five times. (C)

not significant, *significantly altered changes compared to free cells
(p-value < 0.05; Student’s t-test).

The delays in intermediate and
narrow sized tubes were significant
compared to free cells (p-value < 0.0009, Student’s t test) and could be explained by either or both of two
phenomena: first, elongated prometa-/metaphase spindles; and second,
slower elongation speeds of nascent spindles. To address the first
possibility, we measured the lengths of prometa-/metaphase spindles
in cells exposed or not exposed to tubular confinement. Ensuing analyses
revealed that, in <10 μm and 10–12 μm microtubes,
prometa-/metaphase spindles were ∼4 μm longer than those
of free cells (Figures 2B and C, and Supplementary Figures 3B–D). To address the second possibility, we compared the elongation
speeds of nascent spindles in cells dividing without or with tubular
confinement. Experiments revealed that the mean elongation speed of
nascent spindles was significantly reduced from 0.94 ± 0.06 μm/min
in free cells to 0.39 ± 0.05 μm/min in 7–9 μm
microtubes and 0.64 ± 0.05 μm/min in 10–12 μm
microtubes (Figure 2D, blue columns; see Supplementary Figures 3C and D for more information). Under the tightest confinement
conditions, the reduction in elongation speed led to a 15 min delay
in forming spindles of lengths similar to those of free cells (Figure 2D, orange columns;
see Supplementary Figures 3C and D for
more information). This time difference is comparable to the delay
in spindle formation predicted by computational simulations of in silico perturbations of chromosome rings.17 We conclude that the observed spindle formation
delays inside rolled-up nanomembranes are likely due to a combined
effect of elongated prometa-/metaphase-spindle lengths and decreased
elongation speeds during spindle formation. Moreover, these elongated
prometa-/metaphase spindles inside narrow microtubes plateaued for
extensive time periods before further elongating in anaphase (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figures 3C and D). These findings
thus demonstrate that increased durations of spindle formation as
well as strongly prolonged prometa-/metaphases contribute to the extensive
overall mitotic delays occurring inside rolled-up nanomembranes.28

Bipolarization of the Mitotic Actin Cortex
Inside Rolled-Up
Nanomembranes
Mitosis is a geometrically demanding process.
As such, it is spatially controlled to ensure that two equivalent
daughter cells are produced with high fidelity and in various situations
placed into spatially favorable positions. Cells can sense physical
cues in their environment to adjust their cytoskeleton.43 Thus, we tested whether and/or how the cytoskeletal
cortex of mitotic cells was affected by tubular confinement. To do
so, we stained different mitotic stages of free and confined HeLa
cells for actin, a major cytoskeletal protein. Based on confocal and
3D SIM approaches, we performed high- and super-resolution imaging
of actin filaments (F-actin). In free HeLa cells, the overall distribution
of F-actin at the cortex (green, labeled by phalloidin) remained uniform
in different mitotic stages until the formation of the contractile
ring in telophase (see Figure 3A for representative images). By contrast, in confined cells
we detected a remarkable enrichment of cortical F-actin at the cell
tips, facing the open ends of the microtubes. This bipolar accumulation
was reproducibly observed from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) onward
until telophase, and was specific to mitosis, since no such enrichment
was present in confined interphase cells (Figure 3B, left image). Moreover, the bipolar distribution
of actin did not affect formation of the contractile ring in telophase.
A similar staining pattern was observed for cortactin, a monomeric
protein involved in actin polymerization. Thus, it appears that, under
tubular confinement, related, but distinct, cytoskeletal proteins
are rearranged in a similar fashion to one another (Supplementary Movie 7). To quantify this redistribution, we
measured the fluorescent intensities of phalloidin in single 3D SIM
cross sections of mitotic HeLa cells. This revealed a more than 2-fold
higher F-actin accumulation at the cell tips (Figure 3C, red arrowhead) compared to the sides underlying
the microtube walls (Figure 3C, light-blue arrowhead). The fluorescence intensities along
0.5 μm xy cortex sections at different locations
and their evolution through mitosis are presented in Figure 3D. We observed this phenomenon
in both transformed HeLa cells and nontransformed human retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE1) cells (Supplementary Figure 4), suggesting that the bipolar accumulation of certain cytoskeletal
proteins under tubular confinement might be a phenomenon conserved
among various cell types. In line with spindle orientation being tightly
linked to the distribution of the cortex (see Introduction), we noticed
that misaligned spindles in confined cells reorientated themselves
toward the enriched cortex, facing the open ends of the rolled-up
nanomembranes (Supplementary Figure 5).

cells confined within 13–15 μm microtubes. NS, not significant;
comparisons of F-actin intensities between the cell tip and the side
for all mitotic cell cycle phases are significantly different (p-value
< 0.05; Student’s t-test). Scale bars,

Conspicuous Membrane Blebbing of Mitotic Cells Inside Rolled-Up
Nanomembranes
The bipolar enrichment of actin and cortactin
inside rolled-up nanomembranes was accompanied by conspicuous membrane
blebbing (Figure 3B
and C, left), with the cell membrane at the tips of the confined dividing
cells usually undergoing multiple dynamic cycles of bleb formation
and retraction (Supplementary Movie 8).
Furthermore, membrane blebbing occurred exclusively during mitosis.
Blebs are extensions of the cell membrane caused by contractions of
the actomyosin cortex to release hydrostatic pressure.44 In cells dividing under tubular confinement,
pressure can only be released at the cell tips that face the two openings
of the microtubes. Interestingly, we observed that blebbing started
to take place at much earlier mitotic stages in confined cells than
in free cells (Figure 4A). Based on time-lapse images of HeLa cells, we noticed that membrane
blebbing in confined situations started in prometa-/metaphase and
continued throughout cell division (Figure 4A, left two images, and Supplementary Movies 8−10). By contrast, in free cells it occurred exclusively during later
cell division stages, mainly cytokinesis, and to a much lesser extent
(Figure 4A, right two
images, and Supplementary Movie 11). To
quantify the spatial positions of membrane protrusions over time,
we generated kymographs based on phase-contrast time-lapse images.
As shown in the top kymograph in Figure 4B, bleb protrusions (white arrowheads) inside
13 μm microtubes reached lengths of up to ∼10 μm
in prometa-/metaphase and more than 35 μm in anaphase (measured
from the center of the cell). By contrast, we detected no blebs in
free cells in prometa-/metaphase. Moreover, the farthest membrane
protrusions were limited to ∼7 μm in length in anaphase
of free cells (Figure 4B, bottom kymograph). Notably, conspicuous membrane blebbing was
also observed in confined 3D cultured mitotic RPE1 cells,28 demonstrating that the observed phenomena are
conserved between different types of human cells. Blebbing at the
cell tips (the parts of the cell pointing toward the open ends of
the tubes) suggested that cells frequently were under internal hydrostatic
pressure inside the nanomembranes.

Figure 4 Tubular confinement induces marked membrane
blebbing at the tips
of mitotic HeLa cells. (A) Spatially confined cells show conspicuous
blebbing from prometaphase onward (left two images), whereas unconfined
HeLa cells start blebbing only during cytokinesis (right two images).
Membrane blebs are highlighted by orange arrowheads. H2B-mCherry is
shown in red. For white arrows see description in (B). (B) Kymographs

cells (white arrows in A) were created from phase-contrast time-lapse

confined cell (top); every 3 min for 40 min for a representative free
cell (bottom), starting from NEB and cell rounding to the end of telophase.

cells just after NEB. Black arrowheads indicate initial cell membrane
position at NEB, and white arrowheads indicate protrusions of membrane
blebs. (C) Super-resolution 3D SIM images of confined HeLa cells (DAPI,

(c′) or presence (c″) of 25 μM blebbistatin. Scale
bars, 10 μm.

We found that the membrane
blebbing and bipolar actin filament
distributions inside microtubes were largely prevented by treating
cells with blebbistatin,45 an inhibitor
of the force-generating mechanoenzyme myosin II (Figures 4C and 5A, and Supplementary Movies 12−14). Membrane blebs have recently been implicated
in mitotic functions, being shown, for example, to contribute to the
control of spindle positioning46 and to
act as a partly redundant genome safety mechanism by stabilizing the
cleavage furrow during cytokinesis.47 Indeed,
we found that in confined cells, inhibition of blebbing and/or associated
processes caused misplacement of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis
and often led to unequally sized asymmetric daughter cells (Supplementary Figure 6A and Supplementary Movie 15). Such phenomena were less pronounced
in the absence of blebbistatin (Supplementary Figure 6B).

(taken from ref (28)) are shown as a reference (gray bars).

To better understand the role of membrane blebbing in key
mitotic
features, such as mitotic progression and chromosome segregation,
we compared live-cell movies in the presence or absence of blebbistatin.
Movies of mitotic cells when blebbistatin was present exhibited strongly
enhanced prometa-/metaphase delays (Figure 5B) in spatially confined cells. These delays
were particularly pronounced in cells dividing inside microtubes of
intermediate sizes. For instance, in 10–12 μm microtubes,
the durations of prometa-/metaphase increased almost 2-fold (p-value
= 0.00015). Strikingly, blebbistatin also markedly enhanced genomic
instability occurring under tubular confinement. Thus, the percentage
of chromosome segregation errors, especially in microtubes of intermediate
sizes such as those of 10–12 μm diameters, went up from ∼17%
to ∼60% (Figures 5a′ and C). By contrast, blebbistatin had little impact on
the duration of prometa-/metaphase or chromosome segregation errors
in unconfined control cells. Thus, prometa-/metaphase lasted 43.1
± 2.7 min28 in the absence of blebbistatin
compared to 48.3 ± 6.1 min in the presence of blebbistatin (p-value
= 0.065; Figure 5B),
while chromosome segregation errors occurred in ∼6% or ∼9%
of the anaphase cells in the absence or presence of blebbistatin,
respectively (Figure 5C and Supplementary Movie 16). Moreover,
in spite of the previously identified impairment of centrosome separation
by blebbistatin,48 treatment with blebbistatin
posed no significant hindrance on either chromosome rosette formation
or spindle bipolarization in the majority of free cells in our experiments
(unperturbed chromosome rosettes in 100% of 17 counted cells and morphologically
normal bipolar spindles in >95% of 283 cells, respectively; see
also Supplementary Figure 7). This discrepancy
could
reflect differences in cell lines between the two studies (HeLa cells
here versus PtK2/B6–8 cells in the previous report)48 or the 4-fold lower blebbistatin concentrations
we used (25 μM versus 100 μM in the previous report).48 Thus, the lower concentration of blebbistatin
in our study may inhibit some (e.g., membrane blebbing) but not all myosin II-mediated processes. Collectively,
our data suggest that blebbing and/or associated processes contribute
to accurate chromosome segregation, particularly in cells under tubular
confinement. Under these conditions, blebbing and/or associated processes
act as a compensatory mechanism to limit the deleterious effects of
spatial confinement on chromosome segregation and genome stability.

Conclusions
We have used “rolled-up” nanotechnology
to generate
transparent biocompatible 3D structures of tailored tubular geometry
with varying diameters. These nanomembrane tubes can be integrated
into an experimentally convenient pipeline to investigate the growth
and proliferation of mammalian cells under spatial constraints at
high resolution. The SiO/SiO2 bilayer nanomembranes are
therefore viable substrates for studying the effects of tubular confinement
on various cellular processes including but not limited to geometrically
demanding processes such as cell division. The “rolled-up technique”
that we have employed integrates nanofilm engineering and standard
photolithography processes34 and can be
readily scaled-up to produce microtubes as on-chip arrays. The dimensions
(lengths and diameters) and wall thicknesses of these architectures
can be precisely controlled, and moreover, the inner surfaces can
be functionalized with biomolecules, such as fibronectin. The ease
of combining our platform with high- and super-resolution microscopy
allowed us to reveal and analyze mitotic alterations under narrow
tubular confinement, namely: (1) abnormal spindle morphology including
increased lengths of prometa-/metaphase spindles; (2) distorted chromosome
arrangements in prometaphase that are in stark contrast to the highly
ordered chromosome rosettes occurring in unconfined situations; (3)
delays in centrosome separation dynamics during spindle formation;
(4) bipolar distribution of the actin/cortactin cell cortex; and (5)
enhanced mitotic membrane blebbing that occurs at the cell tips facing
the open ends of the microtubes.

Numerous biological systems
achieve robustness by employing feedback
loops.49,50 Our observations suggest that the mechano-
and/or geometry-sensing system of redistributing proteins in response
to spatial constraints may be part of such a feedback mechanism that
monitors cell shape and/or associated features during mitosis. Indeed,
we speculate that cells may sense and respond to spatial strain in
the cortex, perhaps by opening ion channels or by stretching cortical
cytoskeletal proteins such as actin to create new binding sites51,52 and triggering the recruitment of contractile/cortical and/or other
proteins to further translate the signal. Such scenarios will be interesting
to investigate in future studies.

The effects of tubular constraints
that we have observed on key
mitotic features such as the spindle, chromosome rosettes and centrosome
separation, are consistent with the previously reported impact of
spatial constraints on mammalian cell division.14,25 Given that perturbations of spindle morphology and dynamics impair
the “search-and-capture” interactions between microtubules
and kinetochores,53,54 our findings could help explain
the subsequent prometa-/metaphase delays and the increased chromosomal
instability observed previously in such contexts.28 Indeed, the information presented herein provides valuable
clues as to what potential causes could trigger the high percentage
of chromosome segregation errors (CSEs) occurring inside microtubes.
Intriguingly, our findings suggest that some mitosis-specific responses,
especially membrane blebs, are involved in limiting chromosome segregation
errors in certain confined environments. Such responses might also
operate within the context of certain steps during metastasis when
large cancer cells undergo tubular confinement inside blood arterioles
and capillaries. It will thus be interesting to explore precisely
how mitotic processes as diverse as SAC activation, cortex bipolarization,
and membrane blebbing are orchestrated to help limit genome instability
specifically in cells dividing in 3D environments under such types
of spatial confinement. Our 3D nanomembrane technology could provide
an excellent platform for such future studies. Notably, evidence has
emerged that primary and secondary tumors can vary in their genomic/chromosomal
makeup.8−10 It will be interesting in the future to see whether
aberrant mitotic processes, occurring during intravascular proliferation,
could in part explain these differences.

In summary, our study
provides an in-depth characterization of
a versatile rolled-up nanomembrane platform that can be used as a
powerful tool for live single-cell studies. Indeed, the system can
be applied to virtually every cellular pathway amenable to high- and/or
super-resolution microscopy. Rolled-up nanomembranes are highly adaptable
in their design and could easily be combined with various other technologies,
such as electronic circuits and microfluidic lab-in-a-tube systems.29 Moreover, we believe that the array setup of
the tubular nanomembranes has considerable potential to be exploited
for tissue engineering/development and high-throughput drug screening.

Methods and Experimental Section
Fabricating
Microtubes in On-Chip Format for Mammalian Cell
Culture
We fabricated microtubes by rolling-up nanomembranes
on square glass slides (18 mm in length; thickness, 170 μm).
To prepare sacrificial layer patterns, a 2.4 μm thick positive
photoresist (AR P-3510, Allresist GmbH) film was first prepared on
the glass slides by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 35 s followed by
a baking step at 90 °C for 5 min on a hot plate. A conventional
photolithography step using a contact mode mask aligner (MA56, SUSS
MicroTec AG) was exploited to produce designed patterns on the glass
slides. After that, SiO and SiO2 nanomembranes were deposited
onto the patterns with an electron beam evaporation system (BOC Edwards
FL400, Germany) at a glancing angle of 30° and deposition rates
of 5.0 Å/s for SiO and 0.5 Å/s for SiO2, respectively.
To achieve microtubes with diameters ranging from 4 to 20 μm,
SiO/SiO2 bilayers of thicknesses between 25 and 100 nm
were deposited. The binanomembranes were immediately rolled-up into
microtubes by under-etching the sacrificial layers in an acetone solution
for a few seconds. The samples were dried by a super critical point
dryer to prevent the tubes from collapsing. To strengthen the microtubes,
they were further coated with an Al2O3 layer
of 15 nm in thickness, using atomic layer deposition (Savannah 100,
Cambridge NanoTech Inc.) at 80 °C.

Functionalization of the
Microtubes with Fibronectin
To grow a monolayer of octadecanylphosphonic
acid on the microtube
arrays, the samples were incubated in a toluene solution (50 μM)
overnight, followed by a thorough rinse with toluene, acetone and
water. The samples were then immersed into a 1× PBS solution,
containing 100 mM N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 25 mM N-hydroxylsulfosuccinimide (NHS) for 1 h followed by an
incubation step with 20 μg mL–1 fibronectin
for 1 h at 37 °C.

Cell Culture and Synchronization
Untagged HeLa cells
and HeLa cells, stably transfected with histone H2B-mCherry and GFP-tubulin55 or centrin1-GFP,56 were cultured on a T25 (25 cm2) flask in complete medium
(Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich), 2
mM l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% antibiotics) at 37 °C in a humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2. To maintain the stably transfected
cells, 0.4 mg mL–1 G418 (GFP-tubulin, centrin1-GFP)
or 0.5 μg mL–1 puromycin (H2B-mCherry) were
used. RPE1 cells were grown in full DMEM medium, supplemented with
2 mM l-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 1% antibiotic mixture (penicillin/streptomycin,
Invitrogen). To allow cell migration into the microtubes, cells at
a concentration of 2 × 105 cells mL–3 were plated onto microtube arrays and cultured for 1–2 days.
After that, cells growing outside the tubes were removed by a brief
trypsinization step. To enrich mitotic cells in the microtubes, a
double-thymidine block57 (2 mM thymidine)
was performed to synchronize cells in G1/S phase. After release from
the double-thymidine block, the cells were further grown in complete
medium for 7–8 h before imaging them with optical microscopy.

Inhibitor Treatments
Blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was
used at a final concentration of 25 μM and was added 1 h before
cells entered mitosis.

Fixation and Staining for Optical Microscopy
A fixative
solution containing 3% paraformaldehyde, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.25%
glutaraldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer (a mixture of 10 mM PIPES pH
6.8, 300 mM sucrose, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM
EGTA) was used to fix cells for 15 min. 1× PBS solution, containing
1 μM phalloidin-FITC (P5282, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μM DAPI
(4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), was used to stain F-actin and DNA,
respectively. Cortactin was immunolabeled using primary rabbit antibodies
(1:200; ab11066, Abcam plc.) and secondary goat antirabbit-Alexa594
antibody (1:1000; A-11037, Invitrogen GmbH).

Live-Cell Imaging
For time-lapse imaging, the microtube
arrays were mounted on 35 mm dishes (MatTek Corporation). The cells
were then plated onto these arrays and treated with/without chemical
reagents according to the method mentioned above. Imaging was performed
in a heated and humidified chamber (stabilized at 37 °C and containing
5% CO2). Cells were imaged, using an Axio Observer Z1 inverted
microscope (Zeiss, 40× objective). For time-lapse imaging of
cell division events, we captured one frame every 5–15 min,
depending on the specific experiment. Z-stacks (0.5–1.0 μm)
of the mitotic apparatus (entire volume) were obtained every 5 min
with a PLANAPO 40× objective. The images were deconvolved using
Huygens and analyzed using Fiji.58 Images
represent maximum-intensity projections of all z-planes.

High- and Super-Resolution Imaging
Entrapped and free
HeLa cells were fixed in prometaphase and, in the case of untagged
HeLa cells, stained with DAPI and phalloidin–FITC. Confocal
imaging was performed with an LSM 700 inverted microscope (Zeiss)
equipped with a Zeiss C-Apochromat 60 × 1.2 W objective, using
405, 488, and 594 nm laser lines for excitation, a 1532 × 1532
pixel frame size at a rate of 0.42 μs per pixel and a 1 Airy
Unit pinhole diameter. Z-sections taken every 410 nm covering the
entire cell were projected (maximum intensity).

Super-resolution
3D SIM imaging of phalloidin-FITC (F-actin) and DAPI as well as H2B-mCherry
and GFP-tubulin was acquired using a Deltavision OMX 3D SIM System
V3 from Applied Precision (a GE Healthcare company) equipped with
3 EMCCD Cascade cameras from Photometrics, 405, 488, 592.5 nm diode
laser illumination, an Olympus PlanSApo 100× 1.40 NA oil objective,
and standard excitation and emission filter sets. Imaging of each
channel was performed sequentially using three angles and five phase
shifts of the illumination pattern as described in Gustafsson et al.,
2008.59 The refractive index of the immersion
oil (Cargille) was adjusted to 1.514 to minimize spherical aberrations.
Sections were acquired at 0.125 μm z steps.

Raw OMX data were reconstructed and channel registered in the SoftWoRx
software (Applied Precision, a GE Healthcare company). Reconstructions
were carried out using channel-specific Optical Transfer Functions
(OTFs) and channel-specific K0 angles. OTFs were generated within
the SoftWoRx software by imaging 100 nm beads (Life Technologies)
using appropriate immersion oils to match the data. Channel registration
was carried out using the Image Registration parameters generated
within the SoftWoRx software and checked for accuracy by imaging Tetraspeck
beads (Life Technologies). Channel registration was accurate to within
one pixel. Further data analysis was performed using Fiji.58

3D Reconstruction of Chromosomes
Z-stack images were deconvolved with Huygens Professional
4.1 (SVI),
and 3D reconstruction was performed by its module surface renderer.

Statistics and Computational Analysis
Means ±
standard deviations presented herein were obtained by comparing at
least three independently performed experiments. Student’s t-tests, as indicated in the figure legends, were performed
to evaluate statistical differences between two groups, as indicated
in the Figures. P-values ≥ 0.05 were considered nonsignificant.

The 3D Euclidean distances between centrosomes were calculated
using Ace 3D, a visualization and analysis plugin for Fiji58 that uses 3D Object Counter60 to create multidimensional centroid maps for analysis (available
on request).

The 3D temporal evolution of spindle lengths (mean
distances between
centrosomes ± SD) was plotted against time using OriginPro 9.0.0.
The linear portion of the curves was selected by Data Selector tool
and fit by linear regressions utilizing the OriginPro 9.0.0 programming
environment with a least-squares fitting algorithm.
