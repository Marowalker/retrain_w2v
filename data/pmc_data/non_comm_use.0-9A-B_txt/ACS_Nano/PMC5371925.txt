Efficient
and selective methods for covalent derivatization of
graphene are needed because they enable tuning of graphene’s
surface and electronic properties, thus expanding its application
potential. However, existing approaches based mainly on chemistry
of graphene and graphene oxide achieve only limited level of functionalization
due to chemical inertness of the surface and nonselective simultaneous
attachment of different functional groups, respectively. Here we present
a conceptually different route based on synthesis of cyanographene via the controllable substitution and defluorination of
fluorographene. The highly conductive and hydrophilic cyanographene
allows exploiting the complex chemistry of −CN groups toward
a broad scale of graphene derivatives with very high functionalization
degree. The consequent hydrolysis of cyanographene results in graphene
acid, a 2D carboxylic acid with pKa of
5.2, showing excellent biocompatibility, conductivity and dispersibility
in water and 3D supramolecular assemblies after drying. Further, the
carboxyl groups enable simple, tailored and widely accessible 2D chemistry
onto graphene, as demonstrated via the covalent conjugation
with a diamine, an aminothiol and an aminoalcohol. The developed methodology
represents the most controllable, universal and easy to use approach
toward a broad set of 2D materials through consequent chemistries
on cyanographene and on the prepared carboxy-, amino-, sulphydryl-,
and hydroxy- graphenes.

==== Body
Graphene1 is a two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope2 with many potential applications in (opto)electronic
systems (including
systems for DNA sequencing,3,4 spintronics,5 electrochemical energy storage6 and sensing7), coating technologies,8,9 and composites.10 Its potential range
of applications can be extended11,12 by covalent12−14 or heteroatom functionalization15 because
introducing functional groups onto the graphene surface enables modulation
of its electronic,16−18 magnetic,19,20 optical21 and surface properties.22 However, direct covalent functionalization is limited by graphene’s
low reactivity,17,23 and usage of rather severe reaction
conditions in order to achieve graphene derivatization often restricts
the control over the product’s structure and composition. For
instance, the widely used derivative graphene oxide is prepared by
harsh oxidation, and the oxidation conditions profoundly affect its
stoichiometry, structure and properties without selectivity.24 Consequently, there is a need for new strategies
that permit selective and high yielding graphene functionalization
under more controlled conditions.

Fluorographene (FG),18,25,26 which can be prepared by fluorination
of graphene followed by exfoliation,
is a stable, stoichiometric and well-defined graphene derivative.27 Fluorination of graphene can be achieved through
reactions with fluoropolymers, thus avoiding fluorine gas.28,29 Because it is a perfluorinated hydrocarbon, it was expected to be
unreactive and unsuitable for further derivatization (such as Teflon25). Nevertheless, it was recently shown that fluorographene
can react as an electrophile under mild conditions7,30−34 allowing it to function as a starting material for the synthesis
of graphene derivatives that cannot be obtained by direct functionalization
of graphene itself. This approach could potentially circumvent the
longstanding problem of achieving selective and controllable covalent
graphene functionalization.14 To validate
this strategy for preparing graphene derivatives, it will be necessary
to show that FG functionalization is superior to direct functionalization
of graphene in terms of versatility and the yield of attached functional
groups.

The introduction of reactive chemical moieties that
are homogeneously
distributed over the graphene surface would be highly desirable because
it would enable facile immobilization of other guest molecules on
graphene. Carboxyl functionalities are particularly attractive because
they readily undergo diverse conjugation reactions and increase the
material’s hydrophilicity. However, direct and exclusive attachment
of −COOH groups to a graphene surface is very challenging.
It should be noted that while graphene oxide does contain carboxyl
groups, they are attached to edges and defects, and their content
is low (or even absent).24 Moreover, they
are accompanied by many other oxygen-containing groups. Here we present
a two-step process, whereby FG is transformed into the fluorine-free
cyanographene (G-CN, or graphene-nitrile) and subsequently hydrolyzed
to graphene acid (G-COOH). Both G-CN and G-COOH exhibit a high degree
of functionalization (13–15%). Moreover, functionalization
is homogeneous and selective (i.e., no other chemical
groups are formed) and the titration profile of G-COOH closely resembles
that of molecular organic acids, with pKa of 5.2. As such, it can be regarded as a two-dimensional acid. It
has many extraordinary properties, including excellent colloidal stability,
biocompatibility, and high conductivity. Its well-defined structure
and the high quality of its aqueous dispersions are also demonstrated
by the fact that it forms 3D supramolecular lattices upon drying,
similar to those formed by large polyaromatic hydrocarbon nanoflakes.35 Moreover, the carboxyl groups are amenable to
conjugation, enabling covalent attachment of diverse chemical moieties
to the graphene surface, which we demonstrate using three different
primary amines. The functionalization strategy presented here thus
offers unexplored opportunities for controllable graphene functionalization
and the further development of graphene chemistry.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Cyanographene
The reaction of NaCN with FG in DMF resulted
in a high-yielding nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by
C≡N groups and the formation of fluorine-free G-CN. This is
demonstrated by FT-IR spectra (Figure 1a) acquired during the course of the reaction, which
show the C≡N band at 2200 cm–1 gradually
becoming stronger at the expense of the C–F vibrations (∼1200
cm–1). This process is accompanied by reductive
defluorination, whereby some F atoms are eliminated and the corresponding sp3 carbons become sp2 hybridized, forming C=C bonds.36 The FT-IR fingerprint of G-CN at 1500–1600
cm–1 becomes more intense as the reaction proceeds
(Figure 1a, v–viii)
and comes to resemble that of graphite37 (Figure 1a, ix),
demonstrating the formation of an sp2 network.
In addition, high-resolution XPS and survey spectra of FG and G-CN
demonstrate that fewer than 1% of fluorine remains in the G-CN product
(Figure 1b and Figure S1). The presence of the C=C network,
suggested by the FT-IR spectra is further supported by the sp2 component at 284.8 eV in XPS (Figure 1b, (ii) and by the G band in
its Raman spectrum (Figure S2b and S3).
The ID/IG ratio
of G-CN is ∼1.2; together with the broadening of its bands,
this indicates that it is a highly functionalized graphene derivative.38,39 Deconvolution of the HR-XPS revealed that its content of graphitic sp2 carbon atoms is 41 at. % with respect to
total atoms (Figure 1b). Atomic composition analysis based on the HR-XPS data (see Figure S1c) indicate that G-CN contains 11.4
at. % of N (and thus −CN moieties), corresponding to a functionalization
degree (F.D.) of 15% (or 24 wt %). The atomic content of CN amounting
to 11.4% is consistent with the 12 at. % of sp3 lattice carbons, based on the deconvolution of its HR-XPS
C 1s data (the 286 eV band was ascribed to sp3 C atoms bound to −CN groups, Figure 1b). TGA analysis of G-CN (Figure S4) corroborates the XPS results showing an overall
28% mass loss. The somewhat higher mass-loss than the 24 wt % −CN
content from XPS, could be ascribed to additional losses due to defect
sites. Bright field HR-TEM (Figure 1c,d) and AFM (Figures S5, and S6) experiments established the few-layer character of the G-CN flakes.
Finally, elemental mapping by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
revealed that G-CN is densely and homogeneously functionalized because
the carbon (Figure 1f) and nitrogen (Figure 1g) maps overlap nicely. Taken together, these results clearly
show that the reaction of NaCN with GF enables a facile and high-yield
synthesis of graphene nitrile or cyanographene. In view of the fully
defluorinated nature of the product (F content below 1 at. %, Figure S1c), G-CN is considered as a graphene
derivative which is homogeneously decorated with nitrile groups. Its
decoration with reactive organic moieties makes G-CN a versatile starting
material for further functionalization of the graphene surface.

Synthesis of Graphene Acid
In the second step of the
synthesis, G-CN was subjected to acid hydrolysis with 20% HNO3 to transform its −CN groups into −COOH groups.
The successful synthesis and isolation of G-COOH is demonstrated clearly
by the FT-IR spectra of the intermediates of the reaction and the
final product, which show the gradual disappearance of the —C≡N
band and the emergence of a new band at 1725 cm–1 corresponding to the carboxylic groups (Figure 2a). The assignment of this band to carboxylic
groups was validated by recording the FT-IR spectrum of the sodium
salt of G-COOH (see Figure S7). In order
to exclude any oxidizing action of the 20% HNO3 on the
carbon lattice of G-CN, control experiments were performed on FG and
graphite by subjecting them to identical acidic treatment. The FT-IR
spectra in Figure S2c underline the dramatic
differences regarding the COOH presence. The product’s C 1s
HR-XPS spectrum features a new component at 288.7 eV corresponding
to the carboxylic carbons (O—C=O, Figure 2b). On the basis of the atomic composition
analysis showing that O—C=O carbons accounted for 9.3
at. % (see legend of Figure S1c,), the
stoichiometry of G-COOH was estimated to be C6.6(COOH)1. This corresponds to an F.D. of 13%, which (like the value
of 15% determined for G-CN) is substantially greater than the F.D.
for any previously reported covalently modified graphene derivative
(see Table S1). Deconvolution of the C
1s HR-XPS data for G-COOH indicated an sp2 carbon content of 44 at. % (based on the sp2 band at 284.8 eV, Figure 2b), suggesting the dominant presence of graphitic network.
The presence of such a network is further supported by FT-IR bands
in the region of 1400–1620 cm–1 (Figure 2a) and the presence
of a G-band in the material’s Raman spectra (Figure S3a). In contrast to the almost featureless Raman spectrum
of FG, that of G-COOH has significant and broad G and D bands with
an ID/IG ratio
of ∼1.1. The broadening of the bands and this high ID/IG ratio both
indicate a very high F.D.,13,38,39 as with G-CN. The ID/IG ratios in the center (1.09) and at the edges (1.15)
of the flakes, determined by Raman spectroscopy coupled with AFM,
are very similar; together with the similar broadening of the Raman
bands, this indicates a homogeneous distribution of functional groups
over the G-COOH surface (Figure S3). Thermogravimetric
analysis in nitrogen (Figure S8) indicates
that G-COOH is thermally stable up to 200 °C. Up to 800 °C,
the release of COOH groups occurs as suggested by the evolved gas
analysis (EGA), identifying CO2 and H2O as the
dominant species released. The 30% mass loss up to 800 °C is
consistent with the XPS results discussed above, because 9.3 at. %
content of carboxylic carbons corresponds to 32 wt % content of carboxylic
groups. A secondary decrease in mass occurred above 800 °C; the
EGA indicated that this was due to reactions with evolved oxygen leading
to oxidative decomposition of the carbon lattice (Figure S8). HR-TEM images showed a highly transparent sheet
of G-COOH (Figure 2c) with lateral dimensions of around 200 nm; AFM images (Figure S5b) confirmed that it retains the few-layered
structure of G-CN. Interestingly, imaging of G-COOH single sheets
by AFM was complicated by the material’s tendency to organize
into 3D networks stabilized by interlayer hydrogen-bonds (see below).
EDS mapping confirmed that the carboxyl groups’ oxygen atoms
were homogeneously distributed over the graphene surface (Figure 2e,f). Together, these
analyses indicate that the CN groups of G-CN were successfully hydrolyzed
to −COOH groups, resulting in the synthesis of a two-dimensional
acid. These findings also validate the proposed mechanism whereby
the fluorines of FG are exchanged for nitriles by nucleophilic substitution,
and the nitriles are then transformed into carboxylic groups in a
very high yield of 86%. The efficient and homogeneous decoration of
the graphene surface with carboxyl groups should enable conjugation
with a wide variety of functional molecules, greatly expanding the
2D chemistry of graphene and enabling the synthesis of tailored derivatives.

To confirm that the carboxylic acid groups of G-COOH
permit further
functionalization of the surface, we used carbodiimide chemistry to
conjugate G-COOH samples with three different primary amines—the
cysteamine (NH2–C2H4–SH),
the aminoalcohol 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol (H2N–C2H4–O–C2H4–OH),
and the diamine ethylenedioxy-bis(ethylamine) (H2N–C2H4–O–C2H4–O–C2H4–NH2)—via amide bond formation (Figure 3a). The FT-IR spectra of the materials obtained after conjugation
featured aliphatic and C–O bands at ∼2900 cm–1 and ∼1050 cm–1, respectively (Figure 3b, spectra ii and
iii), which were not present in the G-COOH starting material (Figure 3b, (i)). Successful
conjugation and amide bond formation was demonstrated by the appearance
of a new band at 1660 cm–1 (inset of Figure 3b). These reactions had interesting
macroscopic effects on G-COOH. Conjugation with the diamine caused
flocculation and the formation of chunks of black material immiscible
with water, while conjugation with the aminoalcohol yielded a highly
water-dispersible adduct similar to the starting G-COOH (see inset
photograph in Figure 3b). The different behavior of the diamine-conjugated G-COOH may be
due to cross-linking of the G-COOH flakes. The cysteamine conjugate
was characterized by XPS (Figure 3c,d) revealing that its sulfur content was 5.3 at.
%, suggesting conjugation yield of 73% (each conjugation reaction
replaces a −COOH group with a −C(O)NH–CH2CH2–SH moiety, increasing the number of
detected atoms by three). EDS sulfur mapping showed that the conjugation
occurred evenly across the graphene surface (Figure 3e–g) again confirming that the carboxyl
groups of the starting material were homogeneously distributed. These
results clearly show that the carboxylic acid moieties of graphene
acid readily undergo conjugation with diverse molecules, considerably
expanding the chemistry of graphene.

Physicochemical Characterization
and Modeling
The results
presented above show that graphene acid is a suitable platform for
diverse 2D chemistry, with unexplored physical, chemical and biological
properties. Pristine FG is a hydrophobic material that is totally
immiscible with water (Figure S9a), and
FG heat-treated in DMF (control sample) precipitates in water within
seconds (Figure 4b,
(i)). Conversely, G-COOH forms aqueous colloidal dispersions at high
concentrations (at least ∼6 mg mL–1), that
remain stable even after standing for 48 h (Figure 4b, (ii)) and are optically clear (turbidity
free), as shown after dilution in Figure 4b, iii. These stark differences are clear
macroscopic manifestations of the material’s high degree of
COOH-functionalization, which completely inverts the hydrophobic nature
of pristine FG (Figure S9a,b). The acid–base
properties of G-COOH are shown in Figure S9c. As the pH decreases, the negative ζp of G-COOH (∼
−32 mV) drops to less than −10 mV due to protonation
of the carboxyl groups. Moreover, the material’s hydrodynamic
diameter of around 200 nm (Figure 4b) gradually increases until extensive aggregation
leads to its precipitation around pH = 2.5 (Figure S9c and Figure 4e). Importantly, the titration curve of G-COOH (Figure 4c) resembles those of ordinary
molecular carboxylic acids; this stands in striking contrast to GO,
which has a poorly defined titration curve,40 because of its high chemical complexity and varied surface chemical
functionalization.24 Therefore, the pattern
of the titration curve of G-COOH with pKa of 5.2 is another evidence of its well-defined chemistry and acid–base
properties.

from molecular dynamics simulations of protonated and 50% deprotonated
G-COOH in water at low and high pH values, showing their spontaneous
agglomeration and exfoliation, respectively. For clarity, the water

To better understand the effects of carboxyl functionalization
on graphene’s properties, we performed DFT calculations to
estimate the thermodynamic stabilities of surface carboxylated graphenes
Cx(COOH)y with x/y ratios of up to the experimental value
of 6.6 (cf. Supporting Information for details). Most of the structures were thermodynamically stable
(with Ead < 0) and the energy differences
between individual arrangements were small (Figure 4a). This implies that the topology of the
carboxyl groups across the surface is flexible, with many different
local arrangements being thermodynamically accessible and will be
given by a statistical distribution. However, we observed that the
carboxyl groups tend to form chains over the surface, despite the
fact that they do not form intralayer hydrogen bond (H-bond) networks.
Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the tendency of −COOH
groups to form interlayer H-bonds when the pH is below the system’s
pKa (Figure 4e) and the carboxylate groups are protonated.
Both the experimental results (Figure 4b and Figure S9b) and the
MD simulations (Figure 4e) suggested that G-COOH suspensions only become exfoliated when
the pH exceeds the acid’s pKa.
This tendency for interlayer H-bond formation also explains the experimentally
observed formation of spherulitic supramolecular G-COOH crystals (Figure S10) when dispersions of the material
are dried.

The valence and conduction bands of the probable
G-COOH structures
were separated by a band gap smaller than that of FG and midgap states
were identified in some cases, depending on the −COOH content
(Figure 5 and Figure S17). Importantly, many arrangements led
to significantly reduced band gap in the electronic structure with
a quite pronounced density of states near EF indicating appreciable
conductivity. In line with our findings, the reduction of the electronic
gap due to both the functionalization and the structural distortion
has been reported for edge functionalized armchair graphene nanoflakes.41 The calculations revealed that in some cases
the spin-up and spin-down states were split by exchange interaction
indicating on a possibility of inducing magnetism in some G-COOH structures.
The emergence of magnetism was recently confirmed for graphene covalently
functionalized by −F and −OH groups.42 The magnetic properties of graphene-based structures were
triggered by a sublattice imbalance of the graphene bipartite lattice
caused by changes of its sp2 hybrid states
to sp3 by the covalent functionalization
and suitable exchange interaction. The functionalized graphene can
be, hence, considered as sp2 graphene
with sp3 structural defects or vice versa,
depending on the functionalization degree. Electronic and magnetic
properties of the functionalized graphenes are given by the functionalization
degree, nature of the functional group, arrangement of functionalities
and sublattice symmetry.42−46 For the sake of completeness it should be noted that lattice imperfections,
including impurities, defects, atomic vacancies and structural distortion
naturally occur in sheets of functionalized graphenes and they alter
the electronic properties of experimental samples.41,43−45,47 Because the observable
electronic structure of G-COOH will be the result of statistical averaging
over structures and arrangements having both metallic and semiconducting
properties, it should have noticeable conductivity. For this reason,
four-probe resistivity, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in order
to evaluate the conductivity of G-COOH. The sheet resistance of a
G-COOH film amounted to 6800 Ω sq–1 (conductivity
∼25 S m–1; ∼500 S m–1 for G-CN), in stark contrast to that measured for GO, with 5 orders
of magnitude higher sheet resistance (Rs = 2174 × 106 Ω sq–1). Despite
the very high F.D. of G-COOH (>10%), its conductivity value is
similar
to conductivities observed for conventional covalent graphene derivatives
(i.e., 5.13 S m–1 for a carbene
functionalized graphene with 3% F.D.48),
further supporting the high quality derivatives obtained from the
herein proposed method. CV results also highlight the conductive nature
of G-COOH showing very high current response, in antithesis to the
insulating nature of starting FG49 and
GO50 (Figure 4d). EIS corroborates the conductivity measurements
attributing 40-times lower resistivity to G-COOH (Rct = 81 Ω) with respect to GO (Rct = 3542 Ω) (Figure S11a).

Figure 5 Geometrical (left column) and electronic (right column) structures
of FG and its derivatives, as predicted by DFT calculations. The energetically
most stable structures of (a) FG, (b) G-CN, and (c) G-COOH are depicted.
The left-hand images show the DOS profiles for the three materials;
for G-COOH DOS profiles are calculated assuming degrees of functionalization
of 12.5% (red) and 14.6% (gray), respectively (DOS for more functionalization
degrees are shown in Figure S17). In all
cases the energies are zeroed to the Fermi level.

The potential applicability of G-COOH is further strengthened
by
its low toxicity and high biocompatibility, which were demonstrated
by flow cytometry viability tests, reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis
and kinetic measurements of ROS production after incubating NIH 3T3
and HeLa cells for 24 h with various concentrations of G-COOH. G-COOH
had no or minimal effects on cell viability at any tested concentration
(Figure S12a,b). ROS generation is a common
toxicity mechanism of carbon-based and other nanoscale materials.51 However, the kinetic ROS production induced
by G-COOH exposure (Figure S12c and S13), was substantially lower than that induced by other graphene-based
materials,52,53 showing that G-COOH has little
impact on mitochondrial ROS generation.

Conclusion
We
present cyanographene, a graphene derivative enabling to perform
a complex 2D chemistry and high yield covalent functionalization of
graphene. The selective and high-yielding nucleophilic substitution
of fluoride ions in fluorographene by −CN is accompanied by
reductive defluorination that partially re-establishes the delocalized
π-electron cloud and thus conductivity of the cyanographene.
In the following step, a relatively mild acid hydrolysis selectively
transforms −CN to −COOH, whereby the conductivity of
the material is retained. Therefore, the harsh oxidation conditions
used to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups to graphene
during graphene oxide synthesis are bypassed. As a conductive solid-state
2D carboxylic acid, graphene acid may have many electrochemical applications
in sensing,7 batteries54 and proton-conducting membranes.55 Moreover, graphene acid forms highly stable and biocompatible aqueous
colloids and its carboxylic acid groups readily undergo conjugation.
These features extend the portfolio of potential derivatives and predispose
this material for further applications such as in optics56 and theranostics.22 The synthesis and isolation of G-COOH from cyanographene can be
considered to bridge the gap between graphene and “graphene
molecules” (derivatives of large polyaromatic hydrocarbons),57,58 because its tendency to self-organize into 3D lattices of spherulitic
morphologies and supramolecular arrangements is shared with graphene
molecules.34,58,59 Since ordered systems tend to exhibit greater charge-carrier mobility
than disordered ones,58,60 the ability of G-COOH to form
supramolecular crystals, combined with the predicted tunability of
its band gap, is another important enabling property that could be
exploited in charge-transport applications.35,58,59,61 Finally, the
selective chemical functionalization of graphene acid renders it a
superior platform for synthesis of a broad family of graphene derivatives
compared to nonselective chemistry currently performed with graphene
oxide.

Methods
Synthesis of G-CN, G-COOH
and Derivatives with Primary Amines
G-CN
Fluorinated
graphite (120 mg, ∼4 mmol of
C-F units) was added to 15 mL of DMF and sonicated (Bandelin Sonorex,
DT 255H type, frequency 35 kHz, power 640 W, effective power 160 W)
for 4 h under nitrogen atmosphere in a 25 mL round-bottom glass flask.
Then 800 mg of NaCN (∼16 mmol) was added and the mixture was
heated at 130 °C with a condenser under stirring (500 rpm). Sample
aliquots were withdrawn from the flask at different time points to
monitor the reaction progress. Further experiments were performed
on the product treated for 24 h. Intermediates and final product were
left to cool to room temperature, after which an equal amount of acetone
was added. The materials were then separated by centrifugation and
further purified by successive washing steps using DMF, dichloromethane,
acetone, ethanol and water (all 4×). Hot (80 °C) DMF and
water was also used. More washing steps using DMF and water were applied
if the conductivity of the supernatant aqueous fraction was higher
than 200 μS cm–1. During the final centrifugation
steps with water, it was necessary to apply centrifugal forces of
up to 25 000 rcf to isolate the product. To obtain Na-free
products, G-CN was washed with acidified water (pH = 4) to exchange
sodium cations with H3O+ (the ζp of G-CN was determined to be in the range of −30 mV, therefore
contained Na+ as counterions). After washing, the material
was suspended in absolute ethanol, pure DMF or water depending on
the purpose for which it was to be used.

G-COOH
HNO3 (65%) was slowly added at RT
under stirring to a suspension of G-CN in water in a round-bottom
glass flask, until the final concentration of HNO3 in the
mixture reached 20%. The mixture was then heated at 100 °C under
reflux with stirring (350 rpm) for 24 h. Various concentrations of
HNO3 and treatment durations were tested to identify optimal
conditions, and samples were periodically withdrawn to monitor the
reaction’s progress. Intermediates and final products were
left to cool to room temperature and then purified by washing with
water through centrifugation. After a few washings, the product (graphene
acid) stopped precipitating upon centrifugation. Therefore, acidic
water (pH = 4) was used to protonate the material and reduce its dispersibility,
inducing precipitation (as discussed in the manuscript). Alternatively,
dialysis was also effective. Stable aqueous suspensions of G-COOH
were prepared by adjusting the pH of the purified suspension to ∼8.

Conjugation of G-COOH with Primary Amine Molecules
G-COOH
(15 mg) was washed with DMF (for synthesis) 3 times to remove
ethanol or water residues and finally suspended in DMF (15 mL) in
a three-neck round-bottom glass flask. EDC (222 mg, 1.16 mmol) and
oxyma (165 mg, 1.16 mmol) were then added to the suspension, and the
resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at RT, under a nitrogen atmosphere.
A primary amine [diamine: (2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine)
(770 μL, 5.26 mmol) or aminoalcohol (2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol)
(530 μL, 5.26 mmol)] was then added dropwise through a septum
with a syringe and the reaction mixture was stirred for 120 h at RT.
After that period, the mixture was diluted with DMF and the solid
was collected by centrifugation. The product was purified by centrifugal
washings with acetone, ethanol, and water. The diamine-functionalized
product was also washed with dichloromethane because it proved to
be compatible with organic solvents (see Figure 3b).

For the reaction with cysteamine,
G-COOH (15 mg) was washed with DMSO 3 times to remove ethanol or water
residues and finally suspended in DMSO (10 mL) in a glass round-bottom
flask. EDC (222 mg, 1.16 mmol) and oxyma (165 mg, 1.16 mmol) were
then added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at RT
under a nitrogen atmosphere. Triethylamine (1.2 mL, 8.6 mmol) was
also added to scavenge the protons from cysteamine and deprotonate
it after which cysteamine hydrochloride (598 mg, 5.26 mmol) was added
and the mixture was stirred for 72 h at RT. It was then diluted with
acetone, after which the crude product was collected by centrifugation.
The product was purified by centrifugal washing with acetone, ethanol,
and water.

To ensure adequate purification of the washed conjugated
products,
their FT-IR spectra were recorded, and they were then subjected to
the washing procedures described above once again. After this second
washing, their FT-IR spectra were recorded and compared to those obtained
after the first wash. This procedure was repeated until the spectra
from the products after two successive washes exhibited no detectable
differences in the relative intensities of their various bands. At
this point the products were considered to be pure, with no residual
noncovalently bound reagents.
