The
surface of proteins is heterogeneous with sophisticated but
precise hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches, which is essential for
their diverse biological functions. To emulate such distinct surface
patterns on macromolecules, we used rigid spherical synthetic dendrimers
(polyphenylene dendrimers) to provide controlled amphiphilic surface
patches with molecular precision. We identified an optimal spatial
arrangement of these patches on certain dendrimers that enabled their
interaction with human adenovirus 5 (Ad5). Patchy dendrimers bound
to the surface of Ad5 formed a synthetic polymer corona that greatly
altered various host interactions of Ad5 as well as in vivo distribution. The dendrimer corona (1) improved the ability of Ad5-derived
gene transfer vectors to transduce cells deficient for the primary
Ad5 cell membrane receptor and (2) modulated the binding of Ad5 to
blood coagulation factor X, one of the most critical virus–host
interactions in the bloodstream. It significantly enhanced the transduction
efficiency of Ad5 while also protecting it from neutralization by
natural antibodies and the complement system in human whole blood.
Ad5 with a synthetic dendrimer corona revealed profoundly altered in vivo distribution, improved transduction of heart, and
dampened vector sequestration by liver and spleen. We propose the
design of bioactive polymers that bind protein surfaces solely based
on their amphiphilic surface patches and protect against a naturally
occurring protein corona, which is highly attractive to improve Ad5-based in vivo gene therapy applications.

==== Body
Only recently, it has been discovered
that the protein corona largely determines the fate of nanoparticles
in the bloodstream in vivo.1−5 Unlike highly specific ligand–receptor recognition,
protein corona formation on nanoparticle surfaces mainly depends on
multiple weak molecular binding events.4 Protein surfaces are not homogeneous but provide defined amphiphilic
patterns. Although the role of such amphiphilic surface patches in
cell biology is still barely understood, it has been found essential
for their cellular distribution and various interactions with, for
example, other proteins, membranes, and carbohydrates.6 In consequence, molecular recognition concepts have been
proposed such as the corona phase model based on folded heteropolymers
constrained at a single-walled nanotube surface,7 which indicate that slight polarity differences could induce
large differences in molecular biorecognition. The importance of amphiphilic
patches has been previously demonstrated in a synthetic model, where
gold nanoparticles have been prepared with alternating hydrophobic
and hydrophilic segments; these nanoparticles penetrated cellular
membranes more efficiently than particles with the same functional
groups homogeneously distributed on the surface.8 Therefore, we hypothesized that by engineering specific
amphiphilic patches, one could control biomolecule recognition and
even engineer a protein-like corona by synthetic macromolecules.

In nature, viruses are among the most intelligent and efficient
nanotransporters. Their enormous efficiency not only depends on their
highly specific receptor binding, but they can also utilize blood
plasma proteins as shielding corona to enhance their stability and
evade the immune system.9 Specific binding
of blood plasma proteins is predetermined by the surface of the virus
capsid. For instance, blood coagulation factor X (FX) binds to the
surface of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) forming a protein corona that shields
the viruses from attack by natural antibodies and complement,9 which also significantly enhances their liver
transduction efficiency.10,11 In clinical trials,
Ad5 is the most frequently used gene transfer vector to date12 by providing high transduction efficiency in
both dividing and nondividing cells and accommodating large transgene
cassettes.13 However, the clinical applicability
of Ad5-based vectors is severely limited by this native protein corona
formation9,10,14 since the
absorbed proteins dictate whether the vector can transduce certain
cells in vivo and frequently lead to mistargeting
and acute toxicity.15 For example, the
FX in the protein corona triggers highly efficient sequestration of
Ad vector particles in the liver,10,11 which is a
major limitation in Ad5-based gene therapy. In addition, while Ad5 in vitro employs the coxsackie–adenovirus cell surface
receptor (CAR) and α(v)β3/5 integrins to infect cells,
the primary receptor CAR is often not available on target tissue in vivo,16 and tumor cells are
often refractory to transduction by Ad5.17 Therefore, it would be a significant advancement for Ad-based gene
therapy if one could engineer an artificial protein-like corona that
replaces the natural protein corona, which should shield the vector
from neutralizing antibodies and ultimately engineer virus tropism
for therapeutic applications.

Our goal was to mimic the complex
amphiphilic patterns like the
surface topology of proteins by shape-persistent polyphenylene dendrimers
(PPDs) to ultimately control biorecognition of Ad5. PPDs were prepared,
providing alternating negatively charged sulfonic acid and hydrophobic n-propyl groups (e.g., amphiphilic groups) on their surfaces,18,19 and we have identified PPD3 (see Scheme 1) to provide an optimal amphiphilic surface
texture for Ad5 vector binding. PPD3 forms a protein-like corona on
Ad5 and alters Ad5 biorecognition and pathways for gene transduction.
We could demonstrate enhanced vector transduction into low CAR cells,
protecting Ad5 from FX binding and plasma neutralization, and alter
the in vivo tissue distribution of Ad5. Our results
are of great relevance to improve in vivo gene therapy
by synthetic polymers, providing precise amphiphilic surface patterns.
We further envision that our concept could be utilized to create nanoparticle
therapeutics with tailored amphiphilic surface patterns that serve
as artificial protein corona to control the in vivo distribution of nanoparticles, which represents a holey grail in
nanomedicine.

Results
and Discussion
Dendrimers with Precise Amphiphilic Surface
Patches
In cell biochemistry, sulfonic acid groups are only
present in certain
carbohydrates such as heparin. Inspired by heparin sulfate–glycosaminoglycans,
which are observed in blood and undergo multiple protein–protein
interactions, we have synthesized PPDs with surface-exposed sulfonic
acid surface groups. In contrast to carboxylic acids, sulfonic acid
groups are negatively charged independent of the pH (within the biologically
relevant range). As lipophilic residues, propyl chains were selected
due to their performance in a previous in vitro screening
that analyzed the influence of various nonpolar substituents (i.e.,
phenyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, and hexyl chains)
on the cell uptake and toxicity of PPDs.20 1,3,6,8-Tetraethynylpyrene served as the dendrimer core so that
the blue emission of pyrene could be used as a fluorescence probe
to enable monitoring of the macromolecules via fluorescence
microscopy. PPDs with different but precisely established numbers
and orientations of the sulfonic acid/n-propyl surface
groups were synthesized by reacting the core with functionalized cyclopentadienone
building blocks in Diels–Alder cycloadditions. Detailed characterization
of each sample is also given in the Supporting Information Section 2 (Scheme 1).21 We then considered
the impact of the size (first vs second generation),
surface-charge density (PPD2 vs PPD3), and significance
of the n-propyl groups (PPD3 vs PPD4)
on the interactions between the “patched” surface dendrimers
and Ad5.

In the following sections, we describe the formation
of PPD3/Ad5 complexes and their transduction pathways by a combination
of biological and physicochemical methods. The key concern is to alter
the surface topology of Ad5 by dendrimer binding to ultimately control
and improve critical interactions with plasma proteins and cells.

PPD3/Ad5 Complexes with Improved Transduction Efficiency
PPD1 to PPD4 were mixed with Ad5 at a desired ratio in PBS buffer,
and the gene transduction capabilities of Ad5 in the uncoated and
complexed form were tested. Replication-defective Ad5-based vectors
harboring a heterologous expression cassette for the enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used as model system to study transduction
of different cell lines (see SI for details,
Ad5 mentioned in the experimental and results sections always refers
to this vector). Vector particles and PPDs were incubated in PBS buffer
at a molar ratio of 1:10 000, and the complexes were subsequently
used for transduction. After 24 h post transduction, EGFP was quantified
by flow cytometry. CHO-K1 (a subclone of Hamster Chinese ovary noncancer
cell line) and SKOV-3 (human ovarian cancer cell line) cells were
selected, which are difficult to transduce by Ad5 due to low CAR receptor
expression. The corresponding flow cytometry data are depicted in Figure 1c. From PPD1 to PPD3,
with increasing numbers of alternating sulfonic acid/propyl groups,
the transduction enhancement is increased accordingly with PPD3/Ad5
complexes exhibiting the highest transduction efficiencies, about
20-fold higher than Ad5 control alone. The presence of amphiphilic
surface patches was crucial for bioactivity since PPD4 with similar
size and the same number of acid groups as PPD3, but lacking the n-propyl chains, revealed almost no increase of transduction
efficiency for SKOV-3 cells. The trends seen for different dendrimers
were also directly visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1b and Figure S3). With increasing virus concentrations
(particle multiplicity of infection = physical particles per cell,
pMOI) from 1000 pMOI to 5000 pMOI, the transduction enhancement with
PPD3 became even more prominent (>30-fold, Figure 1d). Clearly, biorecognition of Ad5 could
be altered after PPD3 binding to the virus surface, and both the ratio
of the amphiphilic groups (sulfonic acid and n-propyl)
and their surface density on PPDs are essential for their interactions
with Ad5.

Figure 1 PPD3 and Ad5 formed complexes with increased transduction efficiency
on CHO and SKOV-3 cells. (a) Illustration of PPD binding to Ad5 and
transduction. (b) Fluorescence microscopy images of EGFP expression
in CAR-negative CHO-K1 cells. PPD3 significantly enhanced Ad5 uptake

quantification of Ad5-mediated EGFP expression in CAR-negative CHO-K1
and SKOV-3 cells after incubation with PPD1, PPD2, PPD3, and PPD4;

(e) TEM images (scale 200 nm) of Ad5 before and after incubation with
PPD3 and PPD4. Complex formation between dendrimer and Ad5 only occurred
upon incubation with PPD3. ∗∗ represents p-value ≤ 0.01.

This significant binding of PPD3 to Ad5 was therefore studied
further
by light scattering and electron microscopy (Figure 1e and Table S1). By increasing the ratio of PPD3 to Ad5, the particle sizes of
formed complexes increased from 108 ± 11 nm (Ad5) up to about
729 ± 87 nm for PPD3/Ad5 (1000:1 ratio) (Table S1) but maintained low polydispersity index (PDI) below
0.2. In contrast, PPD4 with the same number of sulfonic acid groups
as PPD3, but no n-propyl groups, did not form any
complexes with Ad5 (Table S1) even at very
high concentrations of the dendrimer (10 000:1). The PPD3/Ad5
complexes could be visualized by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 1e),
while, here again, no complexation of PPD4 with Ad5 was found. Obviously,
PPD3 molecules formed a protein-corona-like structure on Ad5, and
the result is in agreement with the transduction data and supported
the assumption that defined patches of amphiphilic groups (sulfonic
acid and n-propyl) are critical for promoting interactions
with Ad5. The interaction between PPD3 and Ad5 was also detected by
biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Figure S10, Figure S11, and Table S2). In the BLI experiment, Ad5 particles with high
number of binding sites interact with a flat sensor surface densely
coated with PPD3–dendrimer binding motifs. According to this
method, the calculated KD (equilibrium
dissociation constant) is as low as 1.27 pM. Most likely, this very
strong binding is a result from multivalent interactions of PPD3 and
Ad5, and it does not reflect the binding event of single PPD3 molecules
with Ad5. However, we clearly show that strong interactions occur
between this dendrimer and Ad5.

Enhanced Ad5 Transduction
of Cells with Low CAR Expression
Coxsackie–adenovirus
receptor (CAR) is the main receptor
at the cellular membrane that recognizes and interacts with Ad5.22 Consistently, cells that do not express CAR
(e.g., most tumor cells) can hardly be transduced by Ad5. By increasing
the ratio of PPD3 to Ad5, we observed a saturable increase in the
efficiency for Ad5 transduction of SKOV-3 cells with low CAR expression
(Figure 2a). In contrast,
transduction of A549 cells with high CAR levels was not influenced
by increasing concentrations of PPD3 (Figure 2a). Similar observations were obtained with
other high and low CAR cell lines (Figure S5). These results revealed that the formation of a PPD3 corona around
Ad5 particles could promote an alternative, yet unknown pathway for
Ad5 uptake that significantly improves Ad5 transduction into low CAR
cells (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Transduction
by PPD3/Ad5 complexes was independent of the primary
Ad5 receptor CAR and the positively charged KKTK motif in the fiber
capsomere. (a) In the presence of FCS, the transduction of SKOV-3
cells by PPD3/Ad5 complexes was increased (blue line) compared to
the absence of FCS (red line) over a broad range of different PPD3/Ad5
ratios. Transduction of the human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma line
A549 was not increased by PPD3/Ad5 complexes (dashed line). Transduction
was performed with 1000 pMOI for all PPD3/Ad5 ratios. The relative
MFI value calculated from transduction by Ad5 only is shown. (b) Illustration
of the difference in cell uptake with PPD3/Ad5 and uncoated Ad5. PPD3/Ad5
uptake into CAR negative cells independent from CAR receptor, whereas
uncoated Ad5 could not. For CAR positive cells, PPD3/Ad5 might still
have utilized the CAR-binding pathway, thus resulting in the same
transduction efficiency as uncoated Ad5. (c) Depiction of native Ad5
with positively charged KKTK motif in the fiber, binding CAR as primary
receptor and recombinant Ad5/F41s without the positively charged KKTK
motif in the fiber that does not bind CAR. (d) Transduction assay
with Ad5/F41s and PPD3. Despite a lack of CAR binding, the KKTK motif
PPD3/Ad5/F41s complexes revealed significantly enhanced transduction
efficiency, which indicated the independence of both CAR and KKTK.

Enhanced Transduction in
Serum
For in vivo applications, the impact
of serum on the transduction efficacy of
the PPD3/Ad5 complexes is crucial. As demonstrated in Figure 2a, the presence of fetal calf
serum (FCS) did not reduce transduction efficiency of PPD3/Ad5 complexes;
instead, we even observed a significantly increased Ad5 transduction
efficiency. Increased transduction efficacy has been reported for
DNA-containing lipoplexes23 due to a protein
corona coating of the lipoplexes, which induced different cellular
uptake pathways. In addition, it has also been shown that distinct
corona proteins can enhance cellular binding and uptake.24,25 Therefore, to study the interaction between blood proteins and PPD3,
the surface of a literature known model system, polystyrene nanoparticles
(ø = 100 nm) were coated with PPD3, and the
protein corona composition was compared to the uncoated nanoparticles. Via SDS-PAGE and proteomics (Figures S12–S14), we could demonstrate that the protein corona
significantly changes after the nanoparticles were coated with PPD3.
After incubation with blood serum, a significantly higher amount of
vitronectin was bound the PPD3-coated nanoparticles in comparison
to the uncoated ones. Vitronectin is one example of a corona protein
that has been reported to mediate cellular interactions with cancer
cells.26 Further studies are required to
analyze the interaction with serum proteins in greater detail. In
these studies, we could clearly demonstrate that serum proteins stabilized
the PPD3/Ad5 complexes in blood serum, which is attractive within in vivo applications.

Transduction Independent
of Primary Ad5 Receptor CAR and Positively
Charged KKTK Motif in Fiber Capsomere
Since PPD3 exhibits
a net negative charge, we initially speculated that the interaction
of Ad5 and PPD3 could be of electrostatic nature involving positively
charged amino acids on Ad5. The most prominent positively charged
motif at the Ad5 surface is the KKTK motif located at the fiber shaft.27 Therefore, an Ad5 mutant Ad5/F41s lacking the
KKTK and being unable to bind to CAR was investigated (Figure 2c). The structure of Ad5/F41s
is almost identical to Ad5 with only a deletion of the KKTK motif
on the fibers. PPD3/Ad5/F41s complexes demonstrated very high uptake
into SKOV-3 cells, as indicated by high EGFP expression depicted in Figure 2d. This result, again,
highlighted that compared to Ad5 alone, PPD3 enhanced vector transduction
when the CAR pathway was not available. Also, PPD3 still interacted
with Ad5/F41s efficiently despite the absence of the positively charged
KKTK. Therefore, binding between PPD3 and Ad5 most likely occurred
at a site distinct from the fiber and did not depend solely on electrostatic
interactions between the negatively charged sulfonic acid groups of
PPD3 and the positively charged KKTK sequence on Ad5. Instead, the
main driving force for the dendrimer interaction with Ad5 could be
the distinct alternating patches of hydrophilic negative charges and
hydrophobic propyl groups of PPD3.

Dendrimer-Coated Ad5 Inhibits
Transduction Pathway Mediated
by Blood Coagulation Factor X (FX)
Factor X is a Vitamin
K-dependent zymogen of the coagulation cascade. It is a serine endopeptidase,
which is synthesized in the liver. Trimers of the Ad5 hexon protein
bind with nanomolar affinity to FX, forming 240 FX binding sites per
virion.10 Following intravenous (i.v.)
administration of Ad5, viral particles predominantly accumulate in
and transduce the liver in rodent and nonhuman primate models.28−30 This is a major limitation for Ad5-mediated gene therapy in humans. In vitro, FX functions as “bridge receptor”
that facilitates attachment of Ad5 to cells. The γ-carboxyglutamic
acid domain of FX binds Ad5, and the serine protease domain of FX
binds cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG).10 Therefore, in agreement with previously published
work,10 addition of FX to cell culture
media could significantly enhance the transduction efficiency of Ad5
(Figure 3a). Surprisingly,
after mixing of FX with PPD3/Ad5 complexes, no transduction enhancement
was observed (Figure 3a), which suggested that PPD3 either occupied a similar binding site
on Ad5 as FX or that it was bound to a site that could affect FX binding.
In both cases, FX would be unable to enhance transduction of PPD3/Ad5
complexes. The results were corroborated by using superphysiological
levels of FX, which are also unable to improve Ad5 transduction (data
not shown). There is a competition between the PPD3–Ad5 and
FX–Ad5 binding, which indicates that the FX and PPD3 sites
are overlapping. FX is known to interact with the hexon capsomer;
thus, it is very likely that PPD3 also binds to the hexon proteins.
Since FX leads to liver transduction of Ad5 in vivo, using the PPD3 corona that replaces the FX corona holds promise
for reducing liver toxicity and also to redirect Ad5-based gene delivery
systems to other organs.

Figure 3 PPD3/Ad5 complexes exhibit increased transduction
efficiency in
human plasma and PPD3 protected FX-binding ablated capsids from neutralization
by the IgM/complement pathway. (a) PPD3/Ad5 complexes were formed
and SKOV-3 cells transduced (1000 pMOI) in the presence or absence
of FX at its physiological concentration (8 μg/mL). While FX
was expectedly able to significantly increase transduction of SKOV-3
cells, the transduction by PPD3/Ad5 complexes was not enhanced by
FX, suggesting that PPD3/Ad5 complexes may not be able to bind FX.
(b) PPD3/Ad5 complexes exhibited increased transduction of largely
refractory SKOV-3 cells in the presence of human plasma of an Ad-naïve
donor (1000 pMOI). (c) FX is known to shield Ad5 particles from attack
by natural IgM antibodies and complement. A FX-binding ablated Ad5
vector, a preferable tool for gene transfer and oncolysis due to its
significantly reduced hepatotropism, did not show enhanced transduction
on SKOV-3 cells (1000 pMOI) but was expectedly neutralized after addition
of 5 μL of plasma from an Ad-naïve donor. PPD3/Ad
complexes at a molar excess of 30 000-times were largely resistant
to neutralization, indicating that PPD3 can replace FX as a protective
shield against IgM/complement. (d) Comparison of uncoated Ad5, PPD3/Ad5,
Ad5ΔFX, and PPD3/Ad5ΔFX for their FX binding and subsequent
neutralizing antibody binding. ∗ represents p-value ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ represents p-value ≤ 0.01.

PPD3 Corona Protects Ad5 from Plasma Neutralization
To solve
the challenge of FX-mediated sequestration of Ad vectors
by hepatocytes, a number of strategies have been proposed including
genetic modifications of the virus capsid to ablate FX-binding.31 However, Xu et al. have previously reported
that elimination of FX binding enabled Ad neutralization by natural
antibodies and complement. In this case, the vector was quickly neutralized
due to the lack of the shielding by FX bound to the virus capsid.9 To analyze if PPD3 could shield the viruses from
neutralizing natural antibodies and complement, we incubated the PPD3/Ad5
complex with the plasma from an Ad naïve human donor
prior to transduction. The efficiencies, analyzed on SKOV-3 cells,
did not decrease after plasma incubation (Figure 3b). In addition, we formed complexes between
Ad5 vectors ablated for FX-binding (Ad5ΔFX) and PPD3 to demonstrate
that PPD3 can prevent plasma neutralization even without FX binding.
These complexes were incubated with human plasma. In the absence of
PPD3, the vectors were completely neutralized by plasma (Figure 3c), while in the
presence of PPD3, infectivity was preserved to a very large degree:
PPD3 not only binds to FX-binding ablated vectors but also protects
them from natural antibodies and complement (Figure 3d), which is essential for in vivo applications.

PPD3 Corona Does Not Affect Wild Type Ad5
(wt Ad5) Activity
and Ad5 Replication
The above experiments utilized a replication-defective
adenoviral vector leaving it unclear whether PPDs would hamper the
ability of the virus to replicate. Any negative impact on virus replication
would disqualify PPD3/Ad5 complexes for oncolytic cancer treatment.
Therefore, we analyzed the potential of PPD3/wt Ad5 complexes to lyse
tumor cell lines. Since wt Ad5 lyses tumor cells, the cytotoxicity
assay was used to evaluate the activity of wt Ad5 (Figure S6). The formation of complexes did, however, not inhibit
virus replication, but increased lysis of SKOV-3 cells compared to
wt Ad5 alone again made the PPD3/Ad5 complexes suitable tools for
oncolytic virotherapy.

Decreased Liver Transduction and Improved
Heart Transduction in Vivo
PPD3/Ad5 complexes
were injected into male
C57BL/6J mice at the age of 9 weeks, and transduction was analyzed
in different organs 14 days post injection. We speculated that PPD3/Ad5
complexes would exhibit reduced liver transduction compared to naked
Ad5. Therefore, the EGFP expression level in liver was initially assessed
by fluorescence imaging of the whole liver tissue (Figure 4a) to demonstrate Ad5-mediated
transduction. In fact, EGFP expression in liver tissue was reduced
by 40% as supported by immunohistochemical analysis of EGFP in hepatocytes
(Figure 4b). Similar
results were also seen by quantification of EGFP DNA in liver using
real-time quantitative PCR (Figure S8).
Noteworthy, the liver was found undamaged in both cases (Figure S9). In addition, EGFP expression was
quantified in liver, heart, spleen, and lung by Western blot analysis
(Figure 4c,d), which
demonstrated decreased transduction of liver and spleen, and lung
by about 40% compared to naked Ad5. Very surprisingly and importantly,
PPD3/Ad5 complexes showed increased transduction of heart tissue by
more than 40%.

complexes in vivo. (a) Fluorescence imaging of the

Therapeutic Potential of
Ad5 with Patchy Dendrimer Corona
PPDs with a defined surface
patterning of amphiphilic groups was
able to specifically bind to the Ad5 surface, altering the existing
surface topology of Ad5 and imparting a synthetic dendrimer corona
providing different molecular recognition features (Figure 5a). In this way, the interaction
of Ad5 with (a) its cellular CAR receptor, (b) plasma proteins, and
(c) the coagulation factor X changes drastically. After PPD3 coating,
the transduction mechanism of the PPD3 coated Ad5 becomes independent
of naturally existing pathways such as CAR and FX, and it significantly
prevents the immediate neutralization of the vector by the innate
defense system composed of natural antibodies and complement. Firm
evidence is provided that upon PPD3 binding, the conventional cellular
uptake of Ad5 via CAR is changed, thus opening a
different, still unknown pathway. This furnishes three significant
advantages providing potential therapeutic opportunities. First, the
complexes can traffic into CAR negative cells, which is not possible
for Ad5 and Ad5/FX. This is highly attractive as many cancer or stem
cells do not express CAR, and therefore, these cells cannot not be
transduced by Ad5. Therefore, PPD3 holds great promise to widen the
therapeutic options of Ad5 as depicted in Figure 5b.

PPD3 corona. (a)
Comparison of uncoated Ad5 and PPD3/Ad5 complex. CAR binding site
and KKTK motif present on the fiber of naked Ad5, while FX and natural
antibodies bind to the hexon. PPD3 forms a protein-mimicking corona

(b) Summary and visualization of PPD3 binding with Ad5, highlighting
the impact of the PPD3 corona on cell Ad5 uptake processes and in vivo distribution (the figure is designed by the graphic
designer Weihang Zhao and permission to use is granted).

Second, the interaction of Ad5 with serum proteins
is altered.
Intravenous delivery of adenovirus vectors requires that Ad5 is not
inactivated in the bloodstream, and serum neutralizing activity is
well documented for Ad5. In the case of Ad5 with PPD3 corona, serum
proteins even boost gene transduction, which represents an essential
feature for in vivo applications.

Third, PPD3
binding has a strong impact on Ad5 interactions with
FX as both PPD3 and FX seem to compete for the same site at the surface
of Ad5, and FX does not affect the transduction efficiency of preformed
PPD3 coated Ad5.

Fourth, intravenous (i.v.) administration of
Ad5 predominantly
leads to accumulation of viral particles in the liver, and transduction
occurs mainly in the liver. Therefore, several studies have been performed
that document the role of blood coagulation FX in mediating liver
gene transfer in vivo and the mechanism underlying
Ad5 hepatocyte transduction10,14,15,32,33 by FX binding to the hexon protein of Ad5 at high affinity (∼2
nM), thus mediating hepatocyte transduction in mice and rats.10 In this way, gene therapy to other organs has
been greatly limited, which can be addressed and improved by Ad5 with
PPD3 corona (Figure 5b). Our in vivo studies proved that the PPD3 corona
significantly reduced the Ad5-mediated transduction indicated by EGFP
expression in the liver by about 40% but increase the transduction
in the heart by more than 40% in comparison to naked Ad5. There is,
thus, evidence that the PPD3 corona imparts a different biorecognition
profile for Ad5, which alters the Ad5 tropism in vivo.

Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that rationally
synthesized amphiphilic
surface patterns of three-dimensional macromolecules play a critical
role for their biological recognition and interaction with Ad5. The
opportunity to remodel the virus surface by precise molecular and
supramolecular design provides control over virus–host interactions.

Redirecting Ad5 tropism has been achieved by genetic engineering
of Ad5. However, PPDs with defined amphiphilic patches provide a versatile
strategy to modify the Ad5 surface and to reengineer Ad5 biodistribution.
On the basis of this, one could further advance Ad5-based gene therapy
toward higher tissue/organ specificity. Although the reason why the
PPD3 complexes target the heart is still unknown, it is envisioned
that by synthesizing PPDs with different tissue targeting moieties,
tissue distribution of PPD/Ad5 complexes will be controlled by rational
design. Therefore, we shall attach further tissue specific targeting
groups to PPD structures to redirect Ad5 transduction to other organs.
This will ultimately regulate the trafficking and cell uptake of viruses in vivo, one of the holey grails in gene therapy. Moreover,
the concept of a bioactive protein-mimicking polymer corona could
allow designing improved nanoparticle therapeutics to control their in vivo distribution, which is still one of the major challenges
in nanomedicine.

Methods
Complex Formation
of Ad5 and PPD3
Complex formation
of Ad5 and PPD3 was performed in 50 μL of phosphate buffered
saline (PBS). This volume contained 5 × 109 Ad5 virus
particles (VP) that resulted in a concentration of 108 Ad5
particles per μL (the concentration of Ad5 was quantified by
measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and converted to number of particles
with the equation: concentration (VP/mL) = OD260 ×
1.1 × 1012). PPD3 was added in defined ratios (if
not otherwise mentioned, ratio of 1:10 000 was used in the
experiments). The volume needed of the PPD 3 stock solution (c = 1
mg/mL, solved in DMSO) was calculated according to the following formula
(N, number of particles; r, ratio between PPD3 and Ad5; M, molecular
weight of PPD3; V, volume; NA, Avogadro constant; c, concentration):  

This is a calculation example for a
PPD3/Ad5 ratio of 1:10 000:  

In this sample with a PPD3/Ad5
ratio of 1:10 000, 0.8 μL
of the PPD3 stock solution was added to Ad5 particles and filled up
with PBS to a volume of 50 μL. Before usage of PPD3, the stock
solution was incubated in the sonicator for ∼30 min to dissolve
assembled molecules because after some storage time, PPD3 molecules
tend to self-assemble. After mixing the solutions, they were incubated
for 20 min at room temperature (RT) and were then used in experiments
(Figure S1). Depending on the experiment
settings, the procedure of complex formation was slightly adjusted
as noted in the particular case.

The same procedure was performed
with dendrimers PPD1, PPD2, and
PPD3.

Experimental Protocol for Transduction Assay
For transduction
assays, 96-well plates were used containing 2 × 104 cells per well, which were seeded the day before transduction. Cells
were infected with pMOI 1000 unless otherwise specified and incubated
for 24 h (CAR positive cell lines such as A549 cells, Hela cells,
and MDCK-2 cells) or 72 h (CAR negative cell lines such as SKOV-3
cells, CHO-K1 cells, and PTK1 cells) at 37 °C. EGFP positive
cells and the overall mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of EGFP expression
was measured by flow cytometry.

PPD3/Ad5 Transduction of
CAR Positive and CAR Negative Cells
Hela and MDCK-2 cells
were maintained in MEM (minimum essential
medium) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CHO-K1 cells were
maintained in F-12 Nut Mix (HAM) 1X (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
heat inactivated FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PTK1 cells were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, 1%
glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All the cells were maintained
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Then 50 μL of dendrimers
and Ad5 solutions were left to equilibrate for 1 h at 37 °C and
then added to 1 mL of medium in a 12-well flat bottom plate containing
105 cells (MOI = 10–100) for 24–48 h at 37
°C with medium supplemented with 2% of FCS. The same experimental
conditions were used in other cell lines. The cells were harvested
24–48 h post-transduction, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, stored
at 4 °C in PBS, and protected from light. The fraction of infected
cells was quantified by flow cytometry, which measured GFP signal
of infected cells. The sample acquisitions were performed with FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences; USA), and 10 000 events were acquired for
each sample. Untreated cells were set as negative control. Each experiment
was performed in triplicate, and the data were analyzed from two independent
experiments.

Animal Experiment and Bioluminescence Imaging
All animal
studies were performed in compliance with protocols that had been
approved by the Hubei Provincial Animal Care and Use Committee and
the experimental guidelines of the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee
of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Male C57BL/6J mice
(purchased from China Three Gorges University) at the age of 9 weeks
were used for in vivo experiments. All mice were
housed in a specific pathogen-free facility. All mouse experiments
were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and according
to the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The mice
were divided into three groups: control group (3 mice), Ad5 group
(6 mice), and Ad5+PPD3 group (6 mice). Ad5 (2 × 1010 VP) or Ad5 incubation with PPD3 (Ad5/PPD3 = 1:10 000, after
20 min) in 200 μL of PBS were administered via tail vein injection. After 2 weeks, all animals were killed. Then
the hearts, livers, spleens, lungs, kidneys, and brains were harvested,
and EGFP expression in the organs was visualized by bioluminescence
imaging at 488 nm/507 nm (excitation/emission). After that, half of
the organs were cryopreserved at −80 °C, and half were
fixed with fixative (4% formaldehyde, 50% ethyl alcohol, 2% acetic
acid).

Western Blot Assay
All organs were ground, and whole
proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail).
Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
protein assay kit. Samples were heated to 100 °C for 10 min in
loading buffer with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, run on 12% SDS-PAGE
gels in electrophoresis buffer (25 mmol/L Tris, 250 mmol/L glycine,
0.1% SDS), and transferred to PVDF membranes. All blots were blocked
in 5% skim milk in TBST (100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
0.1% Tween20) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were probed with
rabbit anti-EGFP, anti-GAPDH, or anti-β-actin (primary antibodies
were used at a dilution of 1:4000 in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)–TBST).
The HRP-linked secondary antibody was diluted 1:2000 in 5% milk–TBST
and incubation at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were visualized
using an ECL detection system.

Immunohistochemistry
Organs were fixed with formaldehyde
and embedded in paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, thin sections
of the embedded tissues were then blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h at room
temperature and incubated with anti-EGFP (1:200) at 4 °C overnight.
After washing for 15 min, the sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibody for 30 min and further incubated with a solution
of DAB. The sections were then dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl
alcohol, cleared with xylene, and covered with a coverslip.

Statistical
Analysis
For statistical evaluation of
the data, Microsoft Office Excel was used. The analysis included calculation
of the mean value and the standard deviation. To compare, for example,
different cell lines, relative values were computed. To analyze the
data’s statistical significance, p-values
were calculated with the TTEST-function (student’s t test) of Excel. P-values ≤ 0.05
were regarded as significant and labeled in graphs with one asterisk
(∗). Data points with two asterisks indicated p-values ≤ 0.01 and three asterisks p-values
≤ 0.001. P-values of data points, which were
regarded as significant, were also provided in brackets in the text
where these data were analyzed and were marked with “p”.
Samples of all experiments were analyzed in triplicates. In the caption
of the graphs, this is referred to as sample number (n).
