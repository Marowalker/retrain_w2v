The development of better Li-ion battery (LIB) electrodes
requires
an orchestrated effort to improve the active materials as well as
the electron and ion transport in the electrode. In this paper, iron
silicide is studied as an anode material for LIBs because of its higher
conductivity and lower volume expansion compared to pure Si particles.
In addition, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be synthesized from the surface
of iron-silicides using a continuous flow coating process where precursors
are first spray dried into micrometer-scale secondary particles and
are then flown through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor.
Some CNTs are formed inside the secondary particles, which are important
for short-range electrical transport and good utilization of the active
material. Surface-bound CNTs on the secondary particles may help establish
a long-range conductivity. We also observed that these spherical secondary
particles allow for better electrode coating quality, cyclability,
and rate performance than unstructured materials with the same composition.
The developed electrodes retain a gravimetric capacity of 1150 mAh/g
over 300 cycles at 1A/g as well as a 43% capacity retention at a rate
of 5 C. Further, blended electrodes with graphite delivered a 539
mAh/g with high electrode density (∼1.6 g/cm3) and
areal capacity (∼3.5 mAh/cm2) with stable cycling
performance.

==== Body
Because of to their high energy
and power density, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the
most promising energy storage technology for mobile devices, electric
vehicles, and large-scale energy storage. To further increase the
energy density of LIBs, relentless research efforts have been invested
in the development of new electrode materials and optimizing the electrode
formulation.1−5 Commercial LIB anodes typically rely on Li-ion intercalation in
graphite (372 mAh/g) or lithium titanate (175 mAh/g).5 However, much higher gravimetric energy densities have
been achieved using anodes that react with lithium by alloying or
conversion mechanisms (e.g., Si, Sn, GeO2, SnO2, Fe3O4, etc.).6−8 Unfortunately, these high capacity materials have disadvantages
including poor cycling stability, large volume change during Li+ insertion/extraction, high voltage hysteresis, poor rate
performance, poor Coulombic efficiencies (CE), and low electrical
conductivity.9−12 To improve the ion and electron transport, as well as to alleviate
mechanical stress, previous researchers have looked into nanostructuring
these active materials. However, nanostructuring often introduces
problems of its own such as low tapped and electrode density as well
as irreversible reactions taking place on the high surface area of
the nanostructured materials. Ongoing research is developing strategies
to alleviate some of these challenges.13−15 In particular, attractive
strategies have been proposed to address the poor conductivity of
high capacity materials by advanced carbon coating processes. For
instance, a number of promising carbon cages have been proposed to
buffer the volume change of active materials,16−18 but these further
reduce the tapped density of the electrodes. Alternatively, flexible
high-aspect conductive carbons, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes
(CNTs), have been studied.19−21 However, these materials tend
to phase segregate after slurry mixing. This is because most carbon
additives with high conductivity disperse well in NMP, whereas metal
or metal oxides materials tend to disperse water well, which makes
it difficult to codisperse them with battery binders such as PVDF
in NMP or CMC/SBR in water.22,23 This phase segregation
during the electrode coating and drying compromises electron conduction
and results in poor material utilization and high ohmic losses. The
phase segregation is particularly pronounced with high areal loading
electrodes pursued in industry, which dry slower.24 Further, several researchers have shown that the interface
between carbon additives and the active material can degrade over
time, which further accentuates the above problems.25,26 Industrially, time-consuming kneading and high intensity mixing
processes are used to reduce the agglomeration of carbon additives,24 and academically, methods are developed to anchor
active battery materials on the surface of carbon additives (e.g., by synthesizing the active material in the presence
of CNTs or graphene).27,28 However, to nucleate the active
material on the carbon additives, the carbon surface typically requires
oxidation or other chemical modifications, which in turn decreases
their electronic conductivity and is poorly scalable.

In this
work, we combine several of the above principles to fabricate
advanced silicon/iron silicide anodes coated with CNTs. In particular,
we focus on a continuous fabrication process that structures nanoparticles
into secondary micrometer-sized particles on which CNTs are synthesized.
Si is a promising active material because of its high theoretical
capacity (>3500 mAh/g), low reaction potential (∼0.35 V),
and
low cost.29−32 Because of these properties, Si is already mixed in very small amounts
with graphite electrodes for commercial automotive applications.5 Here, we start from nanosized silicon particles
(Si NPs) and react them with iron precursors to form iron silicide
for three reasons: (i) to decrease the electrical resistance, which
is 2.6 × 101 Ω cm in FexSiy compared to 6.0 × 103 Ω cm in Si33 and (ii) to
reduce the volume expansion during cycling. This comes at the cost
of a lower capacity (iron silicides <100 mAh/g),33−35 but it should
be noted that because of limitations in the capacity of current cathode
materials (approximately 200 mAh/g), anode capacities in excess of
550 mAh/g do not substantially improve the overall battery performance.36 Here, we first optimize Si/FeSi cores with a
capacity of 1200 mAh/g and then blend them with graphite to obtain
550 mAh/g anodes. (iii) CNTs can be synthesized from iron/iron silicide
domains on Si nanoparticles.37,38 The latter results
in a strong anchoring of the carbon additive on the active material
and fosters a better electric network in the electrode. This approach
inverts the classic approach where carbon additives such as CNTs or
graphene are first oxidized followed by active material synthesis
from surface defects, which compromises the electrical conductivity
of the conductive material. These three properties address electron-transport
challenges as well as problems related to phase segregation during
the electrode mixing but do not solve problems related to the poor
tapped density and poor electrode coating properties of nanomaterials.
In commercial battery electrodes, small primary battery particles
are often aggregated in larger secondary particles to alleviate electrode-coating
challenges and increase the volumetric density.39,40 Here, we follow a similar strategy using spray drying to pack our
Si nanoparticles into micrometer-sized spheres. The electrical resistance
of micrometer-sized pure Si secondary particles would be too high
for good battery operation, but this work shows that CNTs can be synthesized
inside the crevices of the secondary particles hereby providing a
good internal short-range electrical network. In addition, CNTs extending
from the surface of the secondary particles can help with the interparticle
long-range conductivity, which is particularly important as industry
shifts to thicker electrode coatings.24

Impressive results were achieved in previous reports where
CNTs
grown on the surface of Si particles for battery applications, however
in these reports, CNTs were not structured in secondary particles.41−43 As a result, these batteries were only tested in low loading levels
and show poor CE. In contrast, our CVD process on secondary particles
reduces the BET surface area and therefore improves the CEs of the
material.44 Further, we have performed
blending experiments of our electrodes with commercial graphite anodes
to balance the electrode capacity, density and areal loading. Finally,
we demonstrate a continuous flow synthesis method that allows to continuously
synthesize these complex materials from simple precursors. As summarized
in Figure 1, our approach
enables a hierarchical design for battery electrodes where at the
nanoscale the chemical composition of the primary particles and their
interface with carbon additives is controlled while at the microscale
the secondary particle size and carbon additives are controlling the
ion and electron transport, and finally, flow synthesis allows for
continuous material production.

for SiFeCNT synthesis by
a continuous flow setup. The figure illustrates the processes taking
place at different length scales.

Results
Two synthesis routes were followed. In the
first approach, a batch
process is used where the secondary particles are first spray dried
on a commercial tool (ESDT1 Lab Spray Dryer) and are then transferred
to a batch CVD furnace for CNT synthesis. This process allows for
efficient screening of different material parameters. In a second
approach, the continuous flow process shown in Figure 1 is implemented. Both processes are described
in detail in the Experimental Section. In
the first approach, we spray dry an aqueous suspension of 50 nm Si
nanoparticles (0.85 M, NPs) and iron nitrate (0.11 M). We selected
this Si to Fe ratio in order to reach the capacity values of core
materials between 1000 and 1500 mAh/g. In our calculation, if all
Fe atoms form an FeSi2 phase, which has around 100 mAh/g,
the resulting Si and SixFey core particles have a theoretical capacity of ∼1400
mAh/g. The dispersion was prepared by ultrasonication and mechanical
stirring (500 rpm). The suspension was sprayed by a two-fluid atomizer
to ensure narrow droplet size distribution and then dried with a flow
of hot gas (220 °C) holding an outlet temperature of 90 °C.
This process results in the formation of secondary clusters of iron
nitrate and Si particles with an average diameter of ∼3 μm.

Figure 2a shows
a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of these particles after
the spray-drying process and heat treatment at 700 °C in H2/He atmosphere to decompose the iron nitrate and form iron
silicide. All particles have a spherical shape with diameters typically
ranging between 1 and 5 μm. Next, CNTs are synthesized using
CVD in a C2H4/H2/He (50/50/400 sccm)
atmosphere at temperatures ranging between 630 and 850 °C for
2–30 min depending on the targeted CNT loading of the electrode.
As shown in Figure 2, these different CNT synthesis conditions result in varying CNT
loadings, for instance, for 850 °C and 10 min growth (SiFeCNT-850-10),
only few CNTs are observed on the surface of the spheres (length <3
μm, see Figure 2c), whereas for 30 min at 630 °C (SiFeCNT-630-30) much longer
CNTs extend from the surface. Further, cross-section TEM analysis
shows that CNTs are synthesized both inside and outside the pores
of the secondary particle (see Figure 2g–i and S1 and S2). We anticipate that the CNTs inside the particles are critical
for short-range electron transport because of the limited electrical
conductivity of silicon/iron silicide in conjunction with the relatively
large secondary particle size. This is important to achieve a high
utilization of the active material as well as lower electrode impedance.
This is verified electrochemically by reference experiments where
the same spray-dried secondary particles are physically mixed with
CNT powder instead of CVD grown (see further). In addition, the CVD
process results in CNTs that are anchored on the particles and maintain
good contact during cycling and therefore a better electrode stability.

continuous flow process (CNT synthesis duration is approximately 6
s). (g–i) TEM images of SiFeCNT-700-20 sample (the sample was
sectioned to 100 nm thickness).

In a second phase, the same materials are fabricated
using a continuous
flow CVD reactor (see Figure 1).45 The Si and iron nitrate solution
was nebulized (Collison 1-jet nebulizer) in a N2 carrier
gas (2000 sccm). The droplets are then passed through a silica gel
drier and precipitated into the secondary solid particles. These particles
are then carried by the N2 carrier gas into the CVD furnace
where C2H2 and H2 gas is added (60/500
sccm) and CNTs are synthesized at 850 °C. As shown in Figure 2e,f, this continuous-flow
synthesis process also results in spherical secondary particles decorated
with CNTs (see SEM, XRD, and TGA data in Figures S3–S5).

Figure 3 shows X-ray
diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and nitrogen physisorption analysis of different SiFeCNT
formulations (SiFeCNT-x-y with x the CNT synthesis temperature in °C and y the synthesis time in min). Parts a and b of Figure 3 show XRD patterns of hybrid iron silicide–CNT
composite (SiFeCNT) samples prepared using different CVD temperatures
and synthesis times. The Si precursor powder shows a cubic Si phase
(JCPDS No. 27-1402). After a 30 min synthesis, a broad peak around
26° (002) originating from the CNTs is present for all temperatures,
and this peak is less prominent as the temperature increases. Similarly,
as temperature increases, the peak intensities from iron silicide
phases, FeSi2 (JCPDS No. 35-0822) and FeSi (JCPDS No. 38-1397),
increase. Therefore, we conclude that CNTs are synthesized efficiently
at temperatures as low as 630 °C and iron silicide phases are
formed more readily at higher CVD temperature. At 850 °C, the
average crystalline size of the Si precursor calculated by the Scherrer
equation is 52.8 nm (which corresponds well with the 50 nm particle
listed by the provider), and this value decreases to 42.2 nm after
CNT growth at the cost of a FeSi phase, which grows to 18.2 nm (SiFeCNT-850-30).
At the same CVD temperature (850 °C), the iron silicide peaks
increase with the reaction time from 3 to 20 min (see Figure 3b). Overall, this analysis
shows that the CNT content and iron silicide to Si ratio can be controlled
by changing reaction temperature and time. It is important to note
that not all Si is converted to SixFey as this would reduce the capacity of the
material too much. XPS (Figure 3c and S7) profiles confirm the
formation of iron silicide phases. Si 2p spectra shows the peak at
99.5 eV shifts to higher binding energy at 99.8 eV after CNT growth.
This is probably due to Si–Si bonds changing to Si–Fe
bonds as shown in a previous study.46 The
contribution at 101.5 eV in SiFeCNT-850-30 is probably from the formation
of a small amount of Si–C, as confirmed by the XRD results.

Several reports describe how CNTs can be synthesized
from Fe catalyst
rather than from iron silicides, which do not support CNT synthesis.38,47 Therefore, when the Si–Fe mixtures are heated in the CVD
reactor, two competing reactions occur: the first is the synthesis
of CNTs from iron and the second is the reaction of iron and silicon
to form iron silicides. Our data suggest that at high temperature
the silicide phase is formed rapidly, yielding fewer CNTs, whereas
at lower temperature silicides are formed slowly, leaving more time
for CNTs to grow from the iron particles. This is in agreement with
previous studies on the synthesis of CNT forests on Si particle42,48 and Si wafers.38

To investigate
the mass loading of CNTs and their quality, we performed
TGA of samples synthesized under different conditions (temperature
and time) in synthetic air. Figure 3d shows that the CNTs grow more abundantly at low temperatures
(630 °C). We believe this is due to the higher stability of the
iron catalyst under these conditions as discussed above. As with all
CNT-CVD synthesis processes, the CNT growth rate decreases with time
because of catalyst poisoning and diffusion limits of carbon precursors
and various other processes.49−52

TGA analysis in air shows that SiFeCNTs synthesized
at lower temperatures
or short growth times increase in mass between temperatures of 200–400
°C (Figure S8a,b), which is likely
due to iron oxidation.53 This increase
in weight is missing at higher synthesis temperatures or times, suggesting
that in those cases, almost all iron is converted to iron silicide.
Further, as the synthesis temperature and time increase, the SiFeCNTs
show an improved thermal stability. For example, the peak temperature
in TGA decomposition shifts from approximately 550–650 °C
when increasing the CVD temperature from 630 to 850 °C for 30
min growth (Figure 3e). This shift in TGA peak decomposition temperature indicates higher
CNT quality.54,55 Finally, at 850 °C, the
CNT decomposition peak position shifts to higher temperature as growth
time increases (Figure S8c).

The
BET surface area and pore volume of SiFeCNT-850-60 samples
are 63 m2/g and 0.23 cm3/g, respectively (Figure 3f). In spite of the
low density and high surface area of CNTs, the SiFeCNTs have a lower
surface area and pore volume than SiFe clusters (77 m2/g
and 0.44 cm3/g), which were synthesized from the same starting
material but different atmosphere (H2/He without C2H4 to suppress CNT growth). This lower surface
area can reduce side reactions (formation of solid-electrolyte interphase,
SEI), which is an important challenge when using nanomaterials in
LIBs.44

To test the electrochemical
performance of the SiFeCNT secondary
particles developed in this work, they were mixed with a carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC)–styrenebutadiene rubber (SBR) binder in DI
water using a centrifugal planetary mixer. The electrodes were tested
in half cells (2032 coin cells) using 1.3 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC
as an electrolyte with 10 wt % FEC electrolyte additive (see the Experimental Section). As control experiments, we
spray dried pure Si secondary particles as well as SiFe particles
without CNTs. These were then physically mixed with commercial CNT
powders (Nanocyl NC7000) at the same loading to study the benefits
of our in situ CVD synthesis of CNTs (see the Experimental Section). In what follows, we will
refer to the physical mixtures of Si and SiFe with CNTs as Si+CNT
and SiFe+CNT, respectively, whereas particles with in situ CVD grown CNTs from SiFe clusters are denoted SiFeCNTs.

A
first observation when coating the electrodes is that the material
structured in secondary particles forms smooth battery slurries at
standard solvent loading (see experimental section), whereas unstructured mixtures of Si nanoparticles and
CNTs require a large amount of solvent and do not easily form good
battery slurries. In addition, we observed some cracks in films using
SiFe+CNT whereas our SiFeCNT electrodes did not show any cracks under
the same conditions (see Figure S9). This
may be due to the network of CNTs anchored on the SiFe clusters preventing
cracks from forming.

Figure 4a shows
the initial two cycles of our electrodes obtained in the 0.005–1.5
V range, which for the SiFeCNT electrode shows as expected a steep
decrease in potential and a voltage plateau at ∼0.1 V. On the
other hand, we found a sloped capacity contribution when using a SiFe
+ CNTs (same concentration of components), this is likely caused by
excessive electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation on the exposed
CNT surfaces when they are not structured in secondary particles (Figure S11).56,57 A main portion
of the CNTs is positioned inside the secondary particles, which guarantees
good internal electron transport and less SEI formation. This is reflected
in the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which is 74.2% for SiFeCNTs
and only 56.5% for the reference sample where the CNTs are physically
mixed.

and SiFe-cluster+CNT mixture electrodes, obtained at 100 mA/g current
density. (b) Cycling stability and (c) rate performance of SiFeCNT,
SiFe-cluster+CNT, and Si-cluster+CNT mixtures. (d) Internal resistance versus quasi open circuit voltage (QOCV) plots and e) Nyquist
plots for SiFeCNT and SiFe-cluster+CNT mixture electrodes.

After two formation cycles at 100 mA/g, the electrodes
are at 1
A/g current density (1.0 to 0.005 V, 1 C-rates of SiFeCNT, SiFe-cluster,
and Si-cluster are 1640, 1550, and 2275 mA/g, respectively) for 300
cycles (Figure 4b).
Under constant current conditions, the SiFeCNT electrodes increase
in capacity with cycles, reaching up to 1509 mAh/g at 50th cycle (0.6
C). The reversible capacities of SiFeCNT electrodes are 1495, 1336,
and 1163 mAh/g at the 100th, 200th, and 300th cycle. In comparison,
Si+CNT and SiFe+CNT clusters shows much faster degradation. Note that
the Si clusters achieve higher capacities in the first 18 cycles due
to the higher capacity of Si compared to SiFe, but they degrade faster
and their capacity is far off the theoretical capacity. The latter
indicates a poor material utilization, as expected for micrometer
sized secondary particles with low electric conductivity (no internal
CNTs). CE values of SiFeCNT electrodes are noticeable higher than
other formulations and already reach 99% at second cycle of 1 A/g,
while SiFe+CNT electrodes only achieve 99% after 113 cycles and Si+CNT
electrodes after 99 cycles.

As shown in Figure 4c, the SiFeCNT electrodes retain 43% of their
capacity when increasing
the C-rate from 0.25 to 5 C, while under the same rate conditions
only 11% and 5% of the initial capacities are retained in SiFe+CNT
and Si+CNT electrodes, respectively. This is probably due to the better
electrical conductivity in the SiFeCNTs, for which we conducted galvanostatic
intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Using GITT, the internal
resistance can be estimated at different states of charge by calculating
the voltage difference between closed-circuit-voltage (CCV) and quasi-open-circuit-voltage
(QOCV, Figures 4d and S12).58,59 In the first cycle,
SiFeCNT and SiFe+CNT electrodes show similar resistances, which decrease
as lithiation proceeds. During delithiation, the difference in resistance
between SiFeCNT and SiFe+CNT begins to increase above 0.7 V. In the
second cycle, the SiFeCNT electrodes show lower internal resistance,
indicating a lower ohmic and charge-transfer resistance. We suspect
this is due to the (i) good interface between the CNTs and the Si
particles on which they are grown and (ii) good electron transport
inside the micrometer-sized secondary clusters (Figures 2i and S13). In
the physically mixed SiFe+CNT, the formation of SEI on the CNT surface
may insulate them from the active material. Figure 4e shows the evolution of EIS data for SiFeCNT
and SiFe+CNT electrodes over 300 cycles. In the Nyquist plot, semicircles
(related to charge-transfer resistance) of the SiFeCNT electrode initially
decrease and remain stable as cycling proceeds. Decreasing impedance
values during the cycles indicate total resistance of the coin cell
decreases, probably due to the improved contact between CNTs and Si
after swelling of Si particles. On the other hand, the charge-transfer
resistance of SiFe+CNT electrodes increases after the 50th cycle,
which again indicates a degradation of the interface between the CNTs
and the active material in physical CNT mixtures.

As mentioned
in the Introduction, commercial
anodes use Si only as an additive to graphite to create so-called
blend electrodes.5 To investigate the viability
of SiFeCNTs in such electrodes, we mixed SiFeCNT with commercial natural
graphite (NG) powder and CMC-SBR binder (active material to binder
ratio was 96:4 with no additional conductive additives). The blend
ratio was adjusted to achieve a capacity of about 550 mAh/g since
higher anode capacities would not provide significant overall improvement
in cell performance due to the limited capacity of current cathodes.36 Both SiFeCNT and Si NP sample were mixed with
graphite using a centrifugal mixer and were coated on Cu foil followed
by calendaring to achieve industrial loading levels of active mass
(6.5–7.0 mg/cm2) and high electrode density (1.5–1.6
g/cm3).24 To demonstrate the
scalability of our material and electrode preparation, we used roll-to-roll
coating to produce a 35 m long anode (Figure 5a,b). SEM images in Figure 5c show the SiFeCNT and Si NP particles are
well distributed between the graphite particles. These electrodes
were cycled under constant current and constant voltage mode between
0.005 and 1.5 V (formation cycles are shown in Figure S14). Both electrodes were designed to have a similar
performance (SiFeCNT-graphite cells delivers 539 mAh/g and 3.72 mAh/cm2 and the Si NP-graphite cells delivers 551 mAh/g and 3.75
mAh/cm2, all measured at 50 mA/g).

electrodes: (a) Schematic of the R2R coating process for SiFeCNT+graphite

(f) Cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency plots of blend electrodes
at 200 mA/g.

After the formation cycles, we changed current
density to 200 mA/g
and cycled between 0.005 and 1 V. The initial reversible capacities
of SiFeCNT-graphite and Si NP-graphite electrodes are 498 and 500
mAh/g at 200 mA/g, respectively. As shown in Figure 5d,e, the charge–discharge profiles
of the SiFeCNT blend electrodes are more stable and show less polarization.
This is confirmed in Figure 5f, which shows a capacity retention of 96.6% after 50th cycles
for SiFeCNT blends, whereas Si NP blends only retain 74.8% at the
50th cycle. In addition, the CE values of the SiFeCNT blends are significantly
better, which is critical for full cell capacity retention.60,61 In Figure 5f, SiFeCNT
and SiNP blends have a 96.0 and 95.8% initial CE values at 200 mA/g,
respectively. From the second cycle, both electrodes show CE values
above 99.6%. However, the SiFeCNT-graphite electrodes show stable
CE values over cycling, whereas in SiNP blend electrodes CE values
are lower overall and become unstable after 25 cycles. Based on our
half-cell tests of SiFeCNT blend electrodes, we designed a full cell
battery using a LiCoO2 cathode (Figures S15 and S16). First, the cathode (∼23 mg/cm2 and ∼3.0 g/cm3) was tested in a half cell (formation
cycle at 0.1C, followed by 50 cycles at 0.5 C). The cathode
exhibited 163 mAh/g, 95.2% of ICE, and 91.6% capacity retention after
50 cycles. Using this cathode, we tested a SiFeCNT blend anode and
LCO cathode full-cell. Under the same conditions (0.5 C rate cycle
after a formation cycle at 0.1 C), the full cell showed high CE values
above 99% from second cycle and 85.4% capacity retention after 50
cycles. The latter are very good results given the high areal loading
of the material.

Conclusion
In summary, we report a scalable process
to fabricate SiFeCNT secondary
particles for LIB anodes that can be used either by themselves or
blended with graphite. These particles are fabricated by spray-drying
primary Si particles (∼50 nm diameter) into spherical secondary
particles (∼3 μm diameter) to improve their packing density
and reduce the amount of binder needed in the electrode formulation.
Next, CNTs are grown directly from the surface of the Si particles
using CVD, and we found that the nanotubes are formed both inside
and outside of the secondary particles leading to better electron
transport. In addition, the CVD-grown CNTs are strongly anchored on
the secondary particles, and as a result, phase segregation challenges
during mixing and coating are mitigated and the electric network is
maintained during cycling. Pure SiFeCNT electrodes show a capacity
of over 1150 mAh/g after 300 cycles at 1A/g and retain over 43% of
their capacity at a rate of 5C. In addition, we present blend electrodes
where SiFeCNT is mixed with graphite to obtain a 550 mAh/g anode.
These were calendared to obtain industrially relevant loading levels
(>6.5 mg/cm2 and >1.5 g/cm3) and show
a CE of
99.5 from second cycle and capacity retention of 96.6% after 50th
cycle. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our process by a
coating a 35 m long electrode on a roll-to-roll tool.

Experimental Methods
Synthesis of SiFeCNT Using Spray-Dryer and Chemical Vapor Deposition
Initially, to synthesis nanoparticle (NP) clusters, 12 g of Si
NPs (0.43 mol, SAT Nano) and 22 g of iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(54 mmol, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Sigma-Aldrich)
were dispersed in DI water (500 mL) to yield a 6.8 w/v % precursor
solution. This suspension was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Under continuous
mechanical stirring (500 rpm), the suspension was atomized at 220
°C (inlet) with atomization pressure of 3 by using a two-fluid
atomizer (0.8 mm orifice). The temperature of outlet was fixed at
90 °C. Particles were separated from the gas stream in a cyclone
(69% yield) and collected in a glass bottle. After spray drying, the
particles were transferred into a ceramic crucible in a horizontal
tube furnace. Before the CVD process, the Si/Fe nanoclusters were
purged with helium gas and reaction gases for 10 min, respectively.
The powder was heat-treated with flows of 400/50/50 sccm He/C2H4/H2 under different temperature ranges
(630–850 °C). Heat-treatment time was controlled between
2 and 60 min, followed by rapid cooling and purging with He. The SiFe
cluster was synthesized with the same spray-dried particles without
C2H4 gas at 700 and 850 °C.

Synthesis of SiFeCNT Using Continuous Flow Reactor
Si and iron nitrate solution was prepared in the same way. An atomizer
(Collison 1-jet nebulizer) was used to atomize the precursor solution
in a flow of nitrogen gas (2000 sccm). A nebulized droplet was passed
through a silica gel filled drier. After removal of moisture, the
particles entered the furnace, where C2H2 (60
sccm) and H2 (500 sccm) inlets were connected. At an 850
°C tube furnace, CNT formed from the surface of Si/Fe cluster.
The resulting materials were collected on a 12 μm the filter,
connected in-line to the outlet of furnace.

Material Characterization
Morphologies of SiFeCNT materials
were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, a Leo Variable
Pressure instrument with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, TEM-1011, Jeol LTD). For TEM, the sample
was sectioned at a thickness of 100 nm using a powertome XL. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Bruker D8 Advance
(Cu Kα radiation, 6° min–1 scan). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis was performed using
a PerkinElmer Pyris1 instrument machine under air atmosphere. After
stabilizing the temperature at 30 °C for 30 min, samples were
heated to 800 °C at a speed of 2 or 3 °C/min. Nitrogen physisorption
was obtained by using a Micromeritics TriFlex porosimeter. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a PHI 5000 VersaProb (Ulvac-PHI).

Electrode Preparation
The SiFeCNT samples were mixed
with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, MTI Corp.) and styrene–butadiene
rubber (SBR, MTI Corp) with a mass ratio of 10:1.5:1.5 in DI water
solvent. For the SiFe-cluster and Si-cluster, each sample was mixed
with CNT (Nanocyl NC7000), CMC, and SBR with a mass ratio of 7:3:1.5:1.5.
The homogeneous slurry was casted on copper foil with 0.4–0.6
mg(Si or SiFe)/cm2 active material
and dried under 100 °C vacuum oven overnight. For the blending
electrode experiments, SiFeCNT was mixed with commercial natural graphite
(NG) in a 20:80 weight ratio. For the control experiment, a commercial
Si NP blend electrode was prepared (Si NP/NG = 8:92). The blend powders
were mixed with CMC and SBR with the mass ratio of 96:2:2 using DI
water. The slurry was mixed using a centrifugal planetary mixer and
casted on copper foil (active material: 6.5–7 mg/cm2). For roll-to-roll coating, we used Smartcoater 28 (Coatema Coating
Machinery GmbH), and the drying temperature was 120 °C with film
speed of 20 cm/min (unwinder and rewinder tensions are 10 and 20 N,
respectively). After solvent evaporation in a fume hood, the electrode
was pressed to increase the electrode density (1.5–1.6 g/cm3), followed by vacuum drying at 100 °C. For LiCoO2 (LCO) electrodes (3.0–3.1 g/cm3), LCO was
mixed with Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with mass ratio
of 94:3:3 using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), followed
by calendaring and vacuum drying at 100 °C. To make a full cell,
the SiFeCNT-graphite electrode was physically contacted with lithium
chip in electrolyte for 10 min to decrease initial capacity loss by
side reaction. SiFeCNT-graphite to LCO electrode mass ratio was 1.1.

Electrochemical Characterization
2032-type coin cells
were assembled inside the glovebox with metallic Li foil as a counter/reference
electrode. Electrolyte was prepared by adding 1.3 M lithium hexafluorophosphate
(LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC,
Sigma-Aldrich) with 10 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, Insight
Biotechnology, Ltd.). The Si coin cells were tested at 25 °C
under constant current mode (two formation cycles with 100 mA/g and
1 A/g for the cycling test) with a potential range of 0.005–1
V (or 1.5 V vs Li/Li+) using LAND cycler
(Wuhan Land Electronic Co., Ltd.). For the blend electrode test, coin
cells were cycled under constant current and constant voltage mode
for lithiation with a potential range of 0.005–1.5 V (50 mA/g,
two formation cycles) and 0.005–1.0 V (200 mA/g, 50 cycles)
using Biologic VMP3. Cyclic voltammetry (0.05 mV/s scan rate, 0.005–1.0
V), galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT, 20 min reaction
with 0.1 C and 40 min relaxation, 0.005–1.5 V), and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS, 1000–0.05 Hz, 5 mV amplitude)
results were obtained using Biologic VMP3.
