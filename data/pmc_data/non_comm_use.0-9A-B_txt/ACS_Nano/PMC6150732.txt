Recent
years have witnessed the emergence of bacterial semiorganelle
encapsulins as promising platforms for bio-nanotechnology. To advance
the development of encapsulins as nanoplatforms, a functional and
structural basis of these assemblies is required. Encapsulin from Brevibacterium linens is known to be a protein-based vessel
for an enzyme cargo in its cavity, which could be replaced with a
foreign cargo, resulting in a modified encapsulin. Here, we characterize
the native structure of B. linens encapsulins with
both native and foreign cargo using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
Furthermore, by harnessing the confined enzyme (i.e., a peroxidase), we demonstrate the functionality
of the encapsulin for an in vitro surface-immobilized
catalysis in a cascade pathway with an additional enzyme, glucose
oxidase. We also demonstrate the in vivo functionality
of the encapsulin for cellular uptake using mammalian macrophages.
Unraveling both the structure and functionality of the encapsulins
allows transforming biological nanocompartments into functional systems.

Protein-based
nanocages have
gained great interest in nanotechnology and have been developed into
effective delivery agents (nanocarriers) and nanoreactors.1−3 In recent years, a class of nanocages from bacteria called the encapsulins
has emerged as promising nanoplatforms, characterized by their robust
nature.4−9 Nevertheless, compared to other protein-based nanocages, such as
viral capsids,1,10 ferritins,11,12 and heat-shock proteins,13 the development
of encapsulins for nanoplatforms is only in its infancy.6 While cages like viral capsids confine genetic
material, previous studies highlighted that the encapsulins specifically
confine functional and fully folded protein-based cargo, such as an
enzyme or a ferritin-like protein, in that way being recognized as
a bacterial semiorganelle. The encapsulin from Brevibacterium
linens naturally houses a dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP)
within its cavity, which is involved in oxidative stress. DyP is assembled
as a trimer of dimers, i.e., a 240
kDa hexamer. The specific encapsulation mechanism of DyP is mediated
by its C-terminal end, which interacts specifically with a defined
region of the encapsulin inner surface. We recently demonstrated that
fusion of the DyP C-terminal end to a heterologous protein, such as
the teal fluorescent protein (TFP), allows its packaging in these
nanocontainers.14

Despite the recent
sharp increase in the number of studies on encapsulins,4,5,7−9,14−20 structural characterization of encapsulins at the molecular level
is yet to be explored. Encapsulins from Myxococcus xanthus (PDB entry 4PT2)17 and Pyrococcus furiosus (PDB entry 2E0Z)21 assemble into T = 3 (180-subunit,
∼32 nm diameter) nanocompartments, whereas encapsulin from Thermotoga maritima (PDB entry 3DKT)6 assembles
into a T = 1 (60-subunit, 24 nm) particle. Both icosahedral particles
pack ferritin-like proteins that protect cells from oxidative stress.6,17 Notably, the encapsulin fold is similar to the capsid protein fold
of Hong Kong 97 (HK97)-like virions22 (including
dsDNA bacteriophages and herpesviruses), which constitute the most
successful self-replicating system on Earth. Based on these structural
similarities, encapsulins and the HK97-like capsid are hypothesized
to share a common evolutionary origin; encapsulins could be of viral
origin, or viruses might have originated from a similar cellular assembly.4,6 The structural characteristics at the molecular level of encapsulins
that confine enzymes is still poorly understood. Deciphering the structure
is crucial to advance the understanding of enzyme confinement in bacteria
and the functioning of encapsulins as semiorganelles for biochemical
reactions. To characterize the protein structure, as an alternative
to the well-known protein crystallization, cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) recently emerged as a powerful technique.

Here, we
determine the structure of the encapsulin from B. linens with native DyP cargo (DyP-E) and foreign TFP
cargo (TFP-E) using cryo-EM reconstruction. We also investigate the
stability of the DyP-E system under various environmental changes
to demonstrate the robust nature of the encapsulin particles. To put
this robust nature into use and with the aim to substantiate experimentally
that B. linens encapsulins are reconfigurable systems
that function outside of its native environment (i.e., as bacterial semiorganelles), we separately
performed an in vitro catalytic cascade involving
immobilized encapsulins (using DyP-E) and an in vivo/cellular uptake study (using TFP-E). The two independent studies
employing two different cargo systems, which are genetically reconstituted
into B. linens encapsulins, demonstrate the use of
encapsulins as versatile and reconfigurable nanoplatforms.

Characterization of Encapsulin Stability
and Structure
To investigate the robust nature of B. linens encapsulin,20 we characterized
the stability of native DyP-E
against pH changes and higher ionic strength. The stability of encapsulin
particles in seven different pH values was examined (i.e., acidic condition at pH 3–5, native condition
at pH 7.5, basic condition at pH 9–11). Acetate buffer was
used to prepare pH 3, pH 4, and pH 5 buffers, Tris-HCl buffer was
used for pH 7.5 and pH 9 buffers, and phosphate buffer was used for
pH 10 and pH 11 buffers. For each pH value, the encapsulin samples
were incubated overnight and subsequently characterized using size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Upon mixing and overnight
incubation of encapsulin in pH 3 and pH 4 buffers, particle aggregation
was suspected to occur as the solutions became cloudy. Centrifugation
of the solutions resulted in white pellets, and therefore these samples
were not further analyzed.

Apart from pH 3 and pH 4, the encapsulin
particles seemed to be stable at all tested pH values, which is in
agreement with a previous report.23 Characterization
with SEC (Figure 1A,B),
DLS (Figure 1C), and
TEM (Figure 1D), respectively,
showed that uniform and spherical structures were present in all samples.
Notably, the elution profiles from SEC were different at basic pH
(pH 9 and 10); instead of eluting at V = 11–12
mL (characteristic for native encapsulin particles), the encapsulin
incubated at higher pH eluted at a lower volume (V = 9 mL), suggesting an increase in particle size, possibly due to
aggregation. TEM analysis (Figure 1D) showed that typical spherical particles were still
present at basic pH, although a tendency to aggregate was observed.
Aggregation of particles was clearly seen when the incubation at elevated
pH was prolonged to 2 days (Figure 1C), which could be partially reversed by adjusting
the pH back to around neutral. Furthermore, we also noted that a second
peak at V = 15 mL appeared in the case of encapsulin
at pH 11 (Figure 1B),
indicating the formation of smaller particles as it eluted at a higher
volume than intact particles (V = 11–12 mL).
This phenomenon was not observed previously at lower pH values. The
species eluting at V = 15 mL was confirmed to be
encapsulin-based by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1E, red arrow) since the protein band showed up at the
same position as the band of native encapsulin at pH 7.5. Hence, it
is concluded that native B. linens encapsulin partially
disassembles at pH 11. Similar particle disintegration at elevated
pH has been reported for T. maritima encapsulin.15

Figure 1 Characterization of encapsulin at different pH values.
(A) Size-exclusion
profiles of encapsulin at acidic, native, and basic pH monitored at
λ = 280 nm, revealing a single peak of encapsulin (V = 11–12 mL or V = 9 mL) for each profile.
(B) Size-exclusion profiles of encapsulin at native and highly basic
pH, showing an extra peak (number 3) at V = 15 mL
apart from the typical encapsulin peak (numbers 1 and 2). (C) DLS-based

electrophoresis revealing the encapsulin protein band (∼28
kDa) present for all samples. Lanes 1, 2, and 3 correspond to peaks
1, 2, and 3 in B, respectively; lane 4 corresponds to the protein
marker.

To investigate the effect of increasing
ionic strength, DyP-E at
native conditions (pH 7.5) and elevated pH (pH 9) were incubated with
either 1 M NaCl, 1 M MgCl2, or 1 M CaCl2 in
the solution. At both pH 7.5 and pH 9, the encapsulin particles eluted
at a similar elution volume compared to the samples with no salt added
(Figure S1). This finding indicates that
the increase in ionic strength (up to the tested range) does not significantly
compromise the stability of encapsulin particles. This is in stark
contrast, for instance, with the Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle plant virus
(CCMV), which already disassembles when the ionic strength is increased
to ∼1 M at an elevated pH.24 As
for several (nano)technological applications nonaqueous conditions
are required, the effect of the addition of organic solvents was examined.
Here, we chose two of the most common organic solvents added to protein
solutions (usually for chemical modifications),25,26 which are ethanol and DMSO. On the basis of characterization with
TEM, we could still observe the presence of intact, spherical particles
upon the addition of up to 40% DMSO to the encapsulin solution at
pH 7.5 (Figure S2). However, the number
of intact particles was noticeably low, and most of them were already
disassembled/degraded into smaller fragments, even already in the
presence of 20% DMSO. Similarly, addition of 40% ethanol also resulted
in predominantly degraded fragments, and only a very small amount
of intact particles could be observed (Figure S2). On the contrary, addition of up to 20% ethanol did not
seem to affect the structures, as they were highly comparable to the
native encapsulin structures (Figure S2).

We used 3D cryo-EM to analyze the native structures of encapsulin
from B. linens loaded with its natural cargo, DyP
(DyP-E), or with TFP (TFP-E). Nonloaded encapsulin (nl-E) was included
as a control (Figure 2A–C). Whereas DyP- and TFP-loaded encapsulin particles were
homogeneous, with an internal density corresponding to the cargo,
nl-E showed two types of particles, either empty or containing some
material in the internal cavity at a 1:5 ratio (Figure 2A, white and black arrows, respectively).
The presence of material inside nl-E is attributed to random/statistical
packaging of cellular components that might occur during in
vivo assembly; such a phenomenon was also indicated by previously
reported broad distribution of masses of nl-E particles analyzed by
native mass spectrometry.14,20 A 3D reconstruction
(3DR) was obtained for each of the three sets of particles (Figure 2D–F). Based
on a 0.5 Fourier shell correlation (FSC) threshold, the resolution
was 11.4 Å for nl-E and 13.5 and 15 Å for TFP-E and DyP-E,
respectively. These values suggested that structural integrity was
better preserved in nl-E than in cargo-loaded encapsulins, in accordance
with previous biophysical analyses.20 Our
biochemical analysis further confirmed that nl-E particles do not
undergo partial disassembly at elevated pH (i.e., a tendency to aggregate was observed at basic pH, instead
of forming smaller particles, Figure S3). The outer diameter, determined from spherically averaged radial
density plots of the 3DR, was 228 Å for nl-E and TFP-E, but DyP-E
measured 232 Å. Despite this ∼2% size increase, the inner
diameter was identical for the three maps. Encapsulin maps were icosahedral
shells with an average thickness of 28–30 Å, and the particle
is based on a T = 1 lattice.

and TFP-loaded encapsulin

above the mean density; bottom row, 3DR with the front half of the
protein shell removed. Cargo is yellow (nl-E), red (DyP-E), or green
(TFP-E).

At the moderate resolutions achieved,
some features are distinguished;
the capsid is formed by 12 slightly outward-protruding pentamers,
each consisting of five curved, elongated subunits. Particles have
∼5–8 Å diameter holes that extend through the capsid.
These pores were located around the 3-fold axes (Figure 2D–F, arrows) and might
serve as channels through which solutes can be interchanged with the
cytoplasm. To infer cargo organization, 3DRs of DyP-E, TFP-E, and
nl-E particles were calculated without imposing icosahedral symmetry
to avoid smearing cargo features (Figure 2G–I). Although the three maps showed
smooth topography (average resolution ∼24 Å), the cargo
density exhibited distinct features. Whereas DyP-related density was
connected to the inner surface of DyP-E at one 3-fold axis, the TFP-related
density occupied a large part of the inner cavity that, depending
on the map contour, was connected at six or 12 locations. The internal
density of nl-E capsids was much smaller, ∼30 and 15% less
compared to those of DyP-E and TFP-E, respectively.

Encapsulin
maps for B. linens were similar to
the map for the T. maritima T = 1 encapsulin particle,
which has a smaller diameter (230–240 Å). To evaluate
this structural resemblance and considering a similar encapsulin fold,
we performed docking analysis of the T. maritima encapsulin
crystallographic model (PDB entry 3DKT) into the cryo-EM density maps of nonloaded
and loaded T = 1 encapsulins. A total of 60 monomers of T.
maritima encapsulin accounted well for the protein shell
of B. linens nl-E (Figure 3A). This model includes the C-terminal extension
of the packaged protein, a ferritin-like protein (Flp) from T. maritima (Figure 3A, yellow). In addition, most pores in the T. maritima encapsulin shell colocalized with the pores in B. linens nl-E (Figure 3B,
dashed circles). In the functional context of native DyP-E, we were
able to pinpoint the location of both the encapsulated DyP (i.e., connected to one of the 3-fold axes)
and the pores (i.e., mostly at the
3-fold axes); we could deduce that the pores at the corresponding
3-fold axis can function as direct gates for substrates from the cytoplasm
to access the confined enzyme. Together with previous results from
the analyses on particle stability, these findings indicate that the
encapsulin acts as a robust shell encasing the confined protein cargo,
while at the same time allowing molecular flux through the shell resulting
from the porous structure.

from negative staining electron microscopy6 (right). (E) TFP-E map from inside, with docked T. maritima encapsulin (blue) and TFP density (green). The TFP atomic structure
(2HQK) is shown at the same scale (top right).

The role of the DyP C-terminal extension is, as it is for
Flp,
to target the cargo protein to the binding sites on the encapsulin
interior. Considering that DyP is organized as a trimer of dimers,
we calculated a 3DR of DyP-E with C3 symmetry
(Figure 3C). The map
resolution was slightly improved compared to the map calculated with
no symmetry (25 Å versus 28 Å). Furthermore,
DyP was solved as a density with three connections that match with
the location of the Flp C-terminal extensions (Figure 3D, left). The B. linens DyP,
expressed in the absence of encapsulin, was used to calculate a map
from negatively stained particles (Figure 3D, right, EMD entry 1530).6 This recombinantly expressed DyP is similar to our native
encapsulated DyP model. The cryo-EM hexameric DyP map highlighted
the structural differences between the two trimers; the trimer connected
to the encapsulin capsid interior probably has ordered C-terminal
extensions, whereas the other three C-terminal extensions are probably
disordered. The cryo-EM-packed hexameric DyP was observed as an elongated
density (∼114 Å long × ∼ 92 Å wide; ∼3.3
× 105 Å3 volume), compatible with
the dimensions and volume of a recombinant hexameric DyP (∼104
× 104 Å; 2.85 × 105 Å3).
The cryo-EM TFP-related density was ∼5.1 × 105 Å3 (Figure 3E); a TFP monomer (PDB entry 2HQK; a TFP derived from Clavularia sp.)27 is 4.7 × 104 Å3, which suggested that 10–12 TFP copies/particle are
encapsulated, compatible with previous mass spectrometry analysis.14 The internal volume of the B. linens encapsulin particle (∼2.6 × 106 Å3) does not limit loading of the natural cargo, a single hexameric
DyP (240 kDa). DyP loading capacity is instead constrained by the
shape and oligomeric state of the cargo enzyme. Although the DyP hexamer
has six C-terminal extensions that are able to interact with their
cargo-binding sites, its quaternary structure indicates that only
three of these extensions are bound. By similar reasoning, our TFP-E
map indicates that the TFP monomers are evenly distributed in the
encapsulin interior, and the TFP-E particle can contain 10–12
copies (∼400 kDa) of monomeric TFP.

DyP-E and TFP-E have
lower breaking force than nl-E, according
to atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies, which implies that DyP-
and TFP-loaded encapsulins are less stable.20 The estimated resolution values for the calculated maps, which are
inversely related to the number of particles in each map, also suggested
that structural integrity was better preserved in nl-E than in cargo-loaded
encapsulins. As suggested,20 binding of
the three cargo-anchoring sequences to the shell interior could distort
locally icosahedral symmetry for DyP-E. This local distortion in a
3-fold symmetry axis might be needed for optimal function of the hexameric
DyP enzyme complex. For TFP-E, binding of multiple TFP (up to 10–12
copies) to the interior surface of the encapsulin pocket results in
a similar overall destabilization of the shell.

In
Vitro Study of Encapsulin as Nanoreactors
on the Surface
To demonstrate the functionality of encapsulins
for in vitro applications, we investigated the performance
of native DyP-E as a bionanoreactor. The confined DyP inside the encapsulin
cavity allows the particles to catalytically oxidize dye molecules,
for example 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) (ABTS) dye, while reducing hydrogen peroxide to water.19,28 We immobilized the encapsulin particles on a glass surface in order
to ease the particle recovery as well as to demonstrate the catalysis
on a surface, which is commonly preferred for in vitro application such as protein-based sensors.29,30 In comparison to tethering enzymes directly onto the surface, the
immobilized encapsulin would offer a robust and chemically modifiable
shell for, in principle, a variety of confined enzymes. The glass
surface was first modified with pentafluorophenyl silicate (Figure 4A), which introduces
surface reactivity and allows chemical reaction with lysine residues
present on the encapsulin surface.31 We
have previously reported that the lysine residues of B. linens encapsulin are indeed available for chemical modification.18

the presence of nanometer-sized particles (∼24 nm) on the surface.
(C) Schematic representation of a tandem system consisting of GOx
and DyP-E. The initial substrate glucose is oxidized by GOx while
producing H2O2, which in turn is converted by
DyP into water while producing green-colored ABTS radical. (D) Catalytic
assay of the tandem system monitored at λ = 410 nm based on
the absorption of the ABTS radical cation.

To confirm that the particles were covalently immobilized
onto
the surface using this approach, we performed a contact angle measurement
on the encapsulin-modified glass surface, which resulted in the contact
angle of 55–60° as opposed to 75–85° for a
PFPS-modified glass surface (before adding the encapsulin). The decrease
in the contact angle after encapsulin addition indicated a successful
immobilization, as the presence of encapsulin changed the surface
properties into a more polar state (in comparison to the surface with
PFPS only). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4B, we were also able to visualize the encapsulin
particles on the surface using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
On the basis of multiple images recorded with SEM, we estimated the
percentage of coverage area to be 35 ± 5% with up to 1.16 ×
1011 encapsulin particles immobilized on the surface (area:
1 × 1.5 cm2).

After surface attachment, we investigated
the catalytic activity
by carrying out a cascade reaction on the surface. The encapsulin
enzymatic activity was tested based on the oxidization of ABTS dye
while reducing H2O2 produced by an additional
enzyme called glucose oxidase (GOx) that was added into the solution
(Figure 4C). We chose
the well-studied tandem GOx-peroxidase system, as it has been proven
useful as a biosensor for glucose detection,28,32,33 thus providing our system with a possible
functionality. The oxidation of ABTS into its green-colored radical
form was monitored at λ = 410 nm for up to 6 min (Figure 4D) at different glucose concentrations.
In our experiments, GOx (1 μM) was added as the final compound
into the reaction mixture, as it kick-starts the entire cascade reaction.
Noticeably, the DyP-catalyzed formation of ABTS-based radical did
not start immediately after GOx addition (t = 0, Figure 4D), which is attributed
to GOx-catalyzed H2O2 production and diffusion
to the surface-immobilized, encapsulated DyP. As expected, this “lag
phase” was shortened by increasing the concentration of glucose
as more H2O2 is produced with increasing glucose
concentration. In a similar way the “lag phase” decreased
when the surface-immobilized encapsulin was added into a premixed
glucose–GOx solution with H2O2 already
present (Figure S4), which did not change
the reaction rate.

On the basis of the maximum slope (max dA410/dt), we calculated the
reaction rates
(i.e., the rate of the ABTS radical
cation being formed) to be 2.67 μM/min for 0.5 mM glucose, 1.57
μM/min for 3.2 mM glucose, and 1.83 μM/min for 5 mM glucose.
As the activity at lower concentrations is minimal (see Supporting Information section S4), we assume
that 0.5 mM glucose was sufficient to achieve the maximum reaction
rate on the surface (i.e., Vmax = 2.67 μM/min), particularly since
increasing glucose concentrations did not lead to a higher reaction
rate and likely resulted in substrate inhibition instead.34 Considering that the number of the encapsulins
immobilized is equal to the number of confined DyP since each particle
encapsulates one DyP (i.e., 1.16
× 1011 particles), we could calculate the apparent
turnover number of (Vmax/DyP concentration)
to be kcat = 115.4 s–1 (within the reaction volume of 500 μL, the total protein concentration
= 3.86 × 10–10 M). The obtained turnover number
is comparable in magnitude to reported turnover numbers for (nonencapsulated)
DyP in the literature (i.e., kcat = 224 s–1),35 indicating that the surface immobilization did
not lead to a significant activity loss. We have demonstrated here
the catalytic activity of surface-immobilized encapsulin in
vitro and the use of B. linens encapsulins
as bionanoreactors.

Cellular Uptake of Encapsulin
To
evaluate the use of B. linens encapsulins for in vivo applications,
we investigated the uptake of the encapsulin with a fluorescent protein
cargo (TFP-E) by mammalian J774 macrophages. A more detailed biochemical
analyses of TFP-E particles has been reported in previous work by
our group.14 Notably, the modified particles
remain intact and stable over five years of storage at 4 °C (Figure S5), further confirming their robust nature
even with a non-native cargo.

After the addition of TFP-E to
the macrophage cells and subsequent incubation for 4 h, images were
taken with a fluorescent microscope to visualize the TFP cargo (excitation
at λ = 460–490 nm, emission at λ = 525 nm) and
the nuclei of the cells with Hoechst-staining (excitation at λ
= 360–370 nm, emission at λ = 460 nm) (Figure 5). The negative control, a
sample of cells that were not treated with any encapsulin particles
and that remain present after the removal of culture medium, does
not show any fluorescence signal (Figure 5C,D). For 0.033 μM TFP-E, the treated
macrophages show a high fluorescent signal as shown in Figure 5A,B. The green-colored signal
that is found around the nucleus indicates that the TFP cargo was
taken up by the macrophages. On the basis of the fluorescence signal
from the cells (Figure 5B, inset), TFP-E appears to enter the macrophages effectively, but
does not enter the nucleus.

(inset). (C) Bright-field image of the negative control where macrophages
were treated with PBS only. (D) Fluorescence microscopy images showing
no green fluorescence in cells treated with PBS only.

This study shows that the encapsulins can be used
to confine a
foreign protein cargo and preserve their structural integrity for
a prolonged time in vitro, and the cargo can be taken
up by mammalian cells. Further studies are needed to identify whether
the spherical particles stay intact inside the cells as well as the
uptake mechanism.

Conclusion
We have provided structural
insight into the encapsulins from B. linens using
cryo-EM, confirming that the native icosahedral,
cage-like assemblies confine a single peroxidase DyP within its cavity.
Together with particle stability analyses, our findings indicate the
encapsulin acts as a robust shell protecting the confined DyP, while
at the same time allowing molecular flux through the shell due to
the porous structure. Using the same analysis, we also characterized
the structure of modified encapsulin particles with non-native cargo
(i.e., a fluorescent protein). Compared
to the empty encapsulin (nl-E) the protein cages that contain a cargo
are slightly larger, which is in line with our previous analysis.20 The data further confirm the directive role
the C-terminal fragments on the cargo proteins play in their inclusion,6,14 allowing the design and preparation of encapsulin containers with
a variety of guest systems.

To investigate the functionality
of encapsulins as a promising
agent for nanoplatforms, we demonstrated a tandem in vitro catalysis, proving that the encapsulin is able to play a role as
bionanoreactors on the surface as well as the in vivo cellular uptake of modified encapsulins by mammalian macrophages.
Our results provide both a functional and structural basis of B. linens encapsulins for the development of encapsulins
as functional assemblies for nanotechnology, for instance as therapeutic
agents and biosensors.

B. linens encapsulin was
recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified based
on reported procedures.14,18 Encapsulin samples
were stored in “encapsulin storage buffer” containing
20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NH4Cl, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol
at pH 7.5 at 4 °C. For pH variation studies, 100 mM acetate buffer
(CH3COONa–CH3COOH) was used to prepare
pH 3, pH 4, and pH 5 buffers, 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer was used for pH
7.5 and pH 9 buffers, and 10 mM phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4–NaOH) was used for pH 10 and pH 11 buffers. All chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. All incubations
and reactions were conducted at room temperature unless stated otherwise.

Cryo-electron Microscopy and Image Processing
Nonloaded
and DyP- and TFP-loaded B. linens encapsulin (5 μL)
were applied to one side of Quantifoil R 2/2 holey grids, blotted,
and plunged into liquid ethane in a Leica EM CPC cryofixation unit.
Samples were analyzed in a Tecnai G2 electron microscope equipped
with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV, and images were recorded
under low-dose conditions with a FEI Eagle CCD at a detector magnification
of 69 444× (2.16 Å/pixel sampling rate). Image processing
operations were performed using Xmipp36 and Relion37 packages integrated in the
Scipion platform.38 Graphic representations
were produced by UCSF Chimera.39 The Xmipp
automatic picking routine was used to select 6785, 19 591,
and 29 680 individual particle images of nonloaded and DyP-
and TFP-loaded encapsulin, respectively. A 1.2–4.1 μm
defocus range was determined for each image with CTFfind4.40 Particle images were extracted, normalized,
and downsampled to a factor of 2, with a final sampling ratio of 4.32
Å/pixel. Using the Relion routine, a two-dimensional (2D) classification
was performed to discard low-quality particles, and 5357, 15 941,
and 19 779 isometric particles were selected for nonloaded
and DyP- and TFP-loaded encapsulin, respectively. A 3D classification
was run using the structure of Thermotoga maritima encapsulin (PDB entry 3DKT), low-pass filtered to 40 Å, as an initial model.
When icosahedral symmetry was imposed, a single class with 4246, 12 833,
and 15 976 particles was obtained for nonloaded and DyP- and
TFP-loaded encapsulin, respectively. When assuming no symmetry for
nonloaded and DyP- and TFP-loaded encapsulin, three classes were obtained,
but no significant differences were observed between them at the resolutions
achieved, and particles were refined together. DyP-loaded encapsulin
particles were analyzed considering C3 symmetry, and a single class with 9930 particles was selected. These
data sets were used to obtain the final 3DR using the Relion autorefinement
routine. Resolutions of 3D with icosahedral symmetry were estimated
from two independent half data sets using the 0.5 (or 0.3) criterion
of the Fourier shell correlation, and the values for nonloaded and
DyP- and TFP-loaded encapsulin were 11.4 (10.7), 15.1 (13.5), and
13.5 (12) Å, respectively. Similarly, resolution values for asymmetric
3DR were 27.3 (23.8), 28.3 (25), and 24.2 (22.7) Å. For the DyP-loaded
encapsulin with C3 symmetry, resolution
was 24.7 (22.8) Å. The Chimera fitting tool was used to dock
the atomic crystallographic model T. maritima encapsulin
into our cryo-EM encapsulin maps. The encapsulin 3DR are deposited
in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb) with accession no. EMD-3608 (nl-E), EMD-3612 (DyP-E), and EMD-3615
(TFP-E) for maps with icosahedral symmetry; EMD-3609 (nl-E), EMD-3614
(DyP-E) and EMD-3616 (TFP-E) for maps without imposing icosahedral
symmetry; and EMD-3613 (DyP-E with C3 symmetry).

Characterization
of Encapsulin Stability
Size-exclusion
profiles of encapsulins upon pH and ionic strength variation were
obtained by injecting and running 500 μL of each sample (∼15
μM) into a Superose 6 preparative column 10/100 GL (GE Healthcare
FPLC Äkta purifier 900 with a 24 mL bed volume). The size-exclusion
analysis was repeated two times. The hydrodynamic size distribution
of the particles was determined using a Nanotrac Wave (Microtrac)
particle analyzer. For particle imaging with TEM, 5 μL of a
sample was applied onto Formvar-carbon-coated grids, and the liquid
was drained after 30 s. Afterward, 5 μL of a staining solution
consisting of uranyl acetate (1% w/v) was added onto the grids, and
the liquid was drained after 1 min. For protein characterization with
denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), experiments using 12% polyacrylamide
gel were conducted based on procedures in the literature,41 and Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad) was used for
visualization of protein bands.

Immobilization of Encapsulin
onto a Glass/Si Surface
Substrates were rinsed with water,
activated by immersion/cycling
piranha solution (H2SO4–H2O2, 3:1), rinsed with water and ethanol, and then dried
with a steam of nitrogen. Perfluorophenyl-11-(triethoxysilyl)undecanoate
(PFPS) was deposited by substrate immersion into a PFPS solution (dichloromethane
(DCM), 10 mM) for 24 h at room temperature under an argon atmosphere.
The glass wafer was rinsed with DCM to remove unreacted reagent and
dried in a stream of N2. Encapsulin particles were deposited
from buffered solution (0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). The particles
were drop-coated on the flat glass substrate overnight in a closed
vessel to avoid solvent evaporation. Afterward, the glass was rinsed
with buffer solution to remove nonimmobilized particles.

Catalysis of
Surface-Immobilized Encapsulin
A 200 μL
amount of glucose (three different final concentrations: 0.5, 3.2,
and 5 mM) and 200 μL of ABTS (2.5 mM) in Tris-HCl buffer pH
7.5 were placed inside a cuvette together with the glass surface with
the immobilized encapsulin particles. Afterward, 100 μL of GOx
(1 μM) in PBS buffer pH 7.4 was added into the cuvette to start
the reaction, and the absorption value at λ = 410 nm was immediately
recorded for at least 6 min using a PerkinElmer Lamba 850 UV–visible
spectrometer. As control experiments, a PFPS-modified glass surface
without encapsulin particles was used for similar kinetic studies.

The reaction rate based on radical ABTS production is calculated
as follows:  where A is the
absorbance
of radical ABTS at λ = 410 nm, ε is the extinction coefficient
of radical ABTS at λ = 410 nm (36 000 M–1 cm–1), and b is the cuvette path
length (1 cm). dA/dt corresponds
to the maximum slope of the kinetic plots in Figures 4D and S4 derived
using OriginPro 9.0 software. The apparent turnover number kcat was calculated based on Vmax/DyP concentration. Although the particles were immobilized
on the glass surface, the catalytic assay was performed in solution
(i.e., the modified surface was
fully immersed inside a cuvette). The DyP concentration was calculated
based on the number of particles on the surface and the volume of
the reaction. The catalytic assay was repeated at least two times.

Cell Experiments
B. linens encapsulins
containing mTFP (monomeric teal fluorescent protein) were recombinantly
produced in E. coli and purified using the same protocol
established for native B. linens encapsulin. The
concentration of TFP-E was 0.30 μM. Murine macrophage cells
(J774) were cultivated in DMEM. Following the cultivation, 100 μL
of ∼2000 cells was plated per well on a 96-well plate, and
either 0 or 10 μL of TFP-E was added into the well (0 or 0.03
μM TFP-E, respectively). The treated cells were incubated at
37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h to allow the cells to take
up the particles. After 3.5 h of incubation, Hoechst nucleus stain
was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. Following the
incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were rinsed 2×
with phosphate buffer saline (10 mM PBS, pH 7.4) to further remove
nonabsorbed species. A 100 μL amount of HEPES was added to the
cells prior to visualization. For the visualization based on fluorescence,
the cells were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus TH4-200
with an X-Cite series 120pc Q laser from Lumen Dynamics, excitation
at λ = 460–490 nm, emission at λ = 525 nm).
