Silicon
photonics would strongly benefit from monolithically integrated
low-threshold silicon-based laser operating at room temperature, representing
today the main challenge toward low-cost and power-efficient electronic–photonic
integrated circuits. Here we demonstrate low-threshold lasing from
fully transparent nanostructured porous silicon (PSi) monolithic microcavities
(MCs) infiltrated with a polyfluorene derivative, namely, poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO). The PFO-infiltrated PSiMCs
support single-mode blue lasing at the resonance wavelength of 466
nm, with a line width of ∼1.3 nm and lasing threshold of 5
nJ (15 μJ/cm2), a value that is at the state of the
art of PFO lasers. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence shows
a significant shortening (∼57%) of PFO emission lifetime in
the PSiMCs, with respect to nonresonant PSi reference structures,
confirming a dramatic variation of the radiative decay rate due to
a Purcell effect. Our results, given also that blue lasing is a worst
case for silicon photonics, are highly appealing for the development
of low-cost, low-threshold silicon-based lasers with wavelengths tunable
from visible to the near-infrared region by simple infiltration of
suitable emitting polymers in monolithically integrated nanostructured
PSiMCs.

==== Body
Since the
first report of room-temperature
photoluminescence from nanostructured porous silicon (PSi),1 scientists have fantasized about PSi-based lasers,2 enabling the realization of integrated silicon
photonic circuits.3 Although some trials
on the fabrication of a Si nanocrystal-based laser have been attempted
after the discovery of Si nanocrystal optical gain, a PSi-based laser
has not been reported yet.4 In the following
two decades, PSi has been more successfully used in optical biosensing5,6 and nanomedicine,7,8 owing to its vast surface-to-volume
ratio (up to 1000 m2/cm3)9 and unusually long emission lifetime (5–13 μs).

Porous silicon is easily prepared via controlled
electrochemical dissolution of crystalline silicon at room temperature.10 Interestingly, the mass of silicon removed for
unit volume (i.e., the porosity)
is proportional to the etching current density value. This provides
a powerful tool to finely set PSi porosity value and profile and,
in turn, to accurately tune the refractive index of PSi by simply
controlling the current density value and waveform over time.11−13 In this way, a variety of mesoporous photonic structures (e.g., Bragg reflectors (DBRs),14,15 resonant microcavities (MCs),16,17 rugate filters,18,19 waveguides20) operating in both the visible
and near-infrared regions were prepared in PSi through controlled
modulation of the refractive index.

In the past few years, leveraging
a cheap and robust material preparation
technique coupled with a high flexibility and high quality in optical
structure fabrication, PSi has gained renewed interest in integrated
optics and photonics. Gradient refractive index (GRIN) optical elements,21 either 2D or 3D, capable of finely controlling
light propagation, and resonant microcavities,22,23 either monolithic or transfer-printed, able to achieve strong light
emission modification of emitter compounds have been reported. However,
the presence of silicon, which has a strong absorption in the visible
spectrum, has restricted the applicability of these PSi optical structures
to the (near) infrared region.

In this scenario, there is nowadays
an increasing effort put into
the preparation of nonabsorbing PSi optical structures suitable for
the UV–vis applications. Recently, Braun etal. reported on the fabrication of transparent
porous silicon dioxide (PSiO2) and PSiO2/titanium
dioxide (TiO2) optical elements, by either thermal oxidation
or using a combination of thermal oxidation and atomic layer deposition
infilling of PSi.24,25

In spite of such an intense
effort, to the best of our knowledge,
the original dream of a PSi-based laser with room-temperature operation,
either in the visible or in the near-infrared region, has not been
demonstrated yet.

In this work, we report on room-temperature
lasing from monolithically
integrated PSi microcavities. The laser structure consists of a high-quality,
asymmetric and fully transparent PSiMC that is able to support blue
lasing action from a conjugated polymer, e.g., poly(9,9)-dioctylfluorene (PFO), infiltrated inside
it. The PFO-infiltrated PSiMC features single-mode blue lasing at
the resonance wavelength of 466 nm, with a line width of ∼1.3
nm and lasing threshold as low as 5 nJ (i.e., fluence of 15 μJ/cm2), which is among
the lowest values of state-of-the-art PFO-based lasers.26−28 Time-resolved photoluminescence further highlights a substantial
modification of the emission lifetime in the PSiMC, which is shortened
by 57% within the cavity mode, thus confirming a dramatic variation
of the radiative decay rate due to a Purcell effect.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication
of Hybrid PSi/PFO Laser
The preparation
method of the hybrid PSi/PFO laser is sketched in Figure 1(a). First, we prepared a monolithic
asymmetric PSi microcavity operating in the visible region and consisting
of a half-wavelength defect sandwiched between two quarter-wavelength
DBRs featuring a different number of bilayers (Figure 1a-1). The  PSiMC is fabricated by a
single-step electrochemical etching, in a HF/H2O electrolyte,
of a highly doped p-type crystalline silicon. A square-wave etching
current density profile with values of 20 and 400 mA cm–2 is used to produce a stack of alternating PSi layers with porosity
values of 59% (i.e., 1.55 refractive
index unit (RIU) at 550 nm) and 77% (1.28 RIU), respectively. These
values represent a trade-off among achieving a porosity variation
that maximizes the refractive index contrast, avoiding the collapse
of the PSi at higher porosity due to mechanical instability, and eluding
reduced penetration of polymer in the PSiMC due to the small diameter
of the pores at lower porosity. Interestingly, a linear relationship
is found between the central wavelength of the DBR stop-band, and,
in turn, the resonance wavelength of the cavity, and the temporal
period of the etching current density square-wave (Supporting Information Section 1). In fact, by increasing
(decreasing) the temporal period of the etching current square-wave
it is possible to increase (decrease) the optical thickness of high
and low porosity layers in the PSiMC, which leads to a red(blue)-shift
of the DBR stop-band and enables, in turn, the fine-tuning of the
resonance wavelength of the cavity over the whole visible range (Supporting Information Section 1).

PSiMC and subsequent thermal oxidation; (2) application of a thin

the silicon chip through the PDMS slab; (4) infiltration of the PSiMC

layers. Inset: Magnification of the region around the defect layer.

Figure 1b shows
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-section images highlighting
the architecture of an as-prepared asymmetric PSiMC with a half-wavelength
defect layer sandwiched between two DBRs with 30 (top) and 10 (bottom)
bilayers. The square-wave modulation of the porosity along the direction
perpendicular to the wafer surface can be clearly appreciated, with
darker/brighter alternating layers indicating high/low porosity (low/high
refractive index) regions. The defect layer of the cavity can be better
appreciated in the inset, also highlighting the columnar structure
of the pores running perpendicularly to the wafer surface. The detailed
morphology of both low- and high-porosity layers of the PSiMC is shown
in the top-view SEM images in Figure 1(c,d), from which pore sizes in the range of 10–20
and 100–120 nm, respectively, are apparent.

After the
PSiMC is fully etched, the etching current density value
is abruptly increased to produce pseudo-electropolishing (porosity
about 98%) of the silicon underneath the cavity, which facilitates
its eventual transfer-printing to a different substrate, though ensuring
that enough silicon is left to mechanically hold the cavity in place
during the next high-temperature thermal oxidation. The latter is
necessary to fully convert silicon into silicon dioxide, and eliminate,
in turn, any silicon-induced absorption in the UV–vis region.
Pictures of asymmetric PSiMCs both as-prepared and oxidized are given
in Supporting Information Section 2.

We then transfer-printed the oxidized PSiMC onto a transparent
material by directly peeling the cavity off the silicon substrate
using an elastomeric film, namely, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), to
enable transmittance operation (Figure 1a-2). The high chemical affinity between silicon dioxide
and PDMS ensures an easy and effective transfer of the PSiMC from
the silicon chip to the PDMS film, with a damage-free and up-scalable
approach (Figure 1a-3). Figure 1e shows a picture
of an asymmetric PSiMC, with resonance wavelength at 460 nm, transfer-printed
onto a PDMS slab. The uniformity of the blue color reflected from
the cavity is an indication of the good reliability of the whole preparation
process, in terms of etching, oxidation, and transfer-printing steps.

Eventually, infiltration of a blue-emitting polymer, namely, PFO,
inside the cavity is carried out via drop-casting
of the polymer solution into the transfer-printed PSiMC (Figure 1a-4). The polymer
solution uniformly infiltrates the PSi structure for its full depth,
resulting in a hybrid (i.e. inorganic–organic)
PSi/PFO resonant cavity after solvent evaporation (Figure 1a-5). Fluorescence microscope
images of the PSiMC after PFO infiltration highlight a good uniformity
of the infiltration process, both in the in-plane and in the out-of-plane
directions of the cavity (Supporting Information Section 2).

Spectroscopic Characterization of PSi/PFO
Microcavity
Typical reflectance and transmittance experimental
spectra collected
at each preparation step of the PSi/PFO hybrid microcavity are shown
in Figure 2a. Figure 2a-1 shows the reflectance
spectrum at normal incidence of the as-prepared PSiMC (step 1). The
photonic stop-band is centered at 520 nm, with a full-width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of 85 nm and reflectance above 90%. Reflectance fringes above
575 nm are due to Fabry–Perot interference in the PSi layer.
Notice that the reflectance notch corresponding to the resonance wavelength
of the cavity (defect mode), which should occur at 525 nm by design,
is not visible in the reflectance spectrum (blue solid line). This
is due to the uneven number of bilayers of DBRs at each side of the
cavity. In fact, the asymmetric architecture consists of an actual
resonant cavity with two DBRs with 10 bilayers on each side of the
defect layer plus an additional DBR with 20 bilayers on top of the
MC. The latter dominates the reflectance spectrum of the on-chip asymmetric
PSiMC, hindering the actual resonant cavity underneath, as confirmed
by the theoretical reflectance spectrum calculated using the transfer
matrix method (TMM) (light blue dotted line).

(dark green line) and transmittance (light green line) spectra of
the microcavity transfer-printed onto the PDMS slab; (4) reflectance
(dark orange line) and transmittance (light orange line) spectra of
the microcavity after infiltration of PFO. (b) Peak-normalized PL
spectra under continuous wave (CW) laser excitation (λ = 405
nm, indicated with an “*” in (b)) of PFO when infiltrated
into the transfer-printed PSiMC (blue line) and into a PSi layer with
a constant porosity of 66% used as reference nonresonant structure
(red line). The reflectance spectrum (black line) of the PFO-infiltrated
PSiMC is also reported superposed to the emission spectra. (c) Typical
PL radiative decays of PFO infiltrated in the microcavity (blue line)
and in the PSi nonresonant structure used as reference (red line)
at wavelengths corresponding to the cavity mode (λex = 400 nm, λem = 450–480 nm); PL decay time
constants are reported in the table.

After the oxidation process, the photonic stop-band blue-shifts
about 90 nm due to a lowering of the refractive indices of both high-
and low-porosity layers (Figure 2a-2, red line).29 The fwhm
of the photonic stop-band reduces to 45 nm, in agreement with the
lowered refractive index contrast, though a high reflectance (>90%)
is maintained. The theoretical spectrum (dark red dotted line) confirms
that more than the 99% of the silicon is converted into silicon dioxide.
This is also confirmed by Fabry–Perot interference fringes
visible at wavelengths below 450 nm in the oxidized PSiMC, where silicon
absorption dominated for as-prepared PSiMCs.

Both reflectance
and transmittance spectra of the oxidized PSiMC
after transfer-printing on a PDMS slab are reported in Figure 2a-3 (green and light green
solid lines). In this case, the reflectance spectrum is collected
on the opposite side of the PSiMC compared to the previous cases,
with the reflectance probe facing the DBR with 10 bilayers. As expected,
the reflectance spectrum (dark green line) now shows a sharp notch
at 420 nm (fwhm = 4.1 nm) with a quality factor Q = λ/fwhm of 102.5, and the transmittance spectrum (light green
line) of the PSiMC shows a dip in correspondence of the photonic stop-band.
The cavity mode does not show up in the transmittance spectrum, as
validated by theoretical calculations (green and dark green dotted
lines). We argue that light traveling through the cavity at the resonance
wavelength is reflected back by the DBR with 20 bilayers, though scattered
traveling back and forth in the cavity. The cavity shows a transmittance
higher than 75% over the entire visible range outside the photonic
band gap, which further confirms PSi full oxidation.

The infiltration
of PFO in the transfer-printed PSiMC results in
a red-shift (about 50 nm) of the photonic stop-band, due to the increase
in the effective refractive index of the structure induced by the
presence of a polymer with a refractive index greater than that of
air,30 with a concomitant increase of the
fwhm (about 7 nm) of the defect mode at 466 nm (Q = 67), due to the lowered refractive index contrast (Figure 2a-4, orange and light orange
solid lines). The stop-band remains well-defined with no additional
shoulders, indirect indication that the cavity is uniformly infiltrated
with PFO. The transmittance value is still higher than 55% at wavelengths
above 500 nm, though a broad absorption band emerges below 400 nm
that further confirms the presence of the PFO. Theoretical spectra
(orange and light orange dotted lines) point out that the fraction
of the polymer infiltrated in the PSiMC is 4% of the air volume.

The good agreement between experimental and calculated spectra
after each preparation step confirms good accuracy between design
and fabrication of PSi/PFO microcavities, for both morphological (i.e., layer thickness, porosity, period)
and optical (i.e., refractive index
value, profile) parameters. A more detailed description of the calculated
spectra is reported in the Supporting Information Section 2.

Figure 2b compares
peak-normalized emission spectra under continuous wave (CW) laser
excitation (λ = 405 nm) of PFO when infiltrated into the transfer-printed
PSiMC (blue line) and into an oxidized PSi layer with constant porosity
of 66% transfer-printed on a PDMS slab (red line, used as reference
nonresonant structure). The reflectance spectrum (black line) of the
PFO-infiltrated PSiMC is also reported in Figure 2b superposed to the emission spectra. The
PSi reference acts as a simple interferometer (reflectance spectrum
in Supporting Information Section 3), and
it does not provide any optical feedback that might induce modification
of the density of state of PFO. The PL spectrum of PFO infiltrated
inside the PSi reference exhibits the characteristic vibronic progression
of the emission peaks at 438, 466, and 497 nm. This is fully consistent
with the photoluminescence spectrum of a PFO thin film drop-cast onto
a PDMS slab (Supporting Information Section
3) and in perfect agreement with the one reported in the literature
for the β-phase of the polymer.31

On the other hand, when PFO is embedded inside the PSiMC,
which
was designed to have the cavity mode perfectly overlapping the amplified
spontaneous emission (ASE) of PFO,26 there
is a redistribution of the oscillator strength17 that strongly modifies the PL spectrum. Specifically, the
PL emission is significantly enhanced (50%) and narrowed (fwhm = 2.9
nm) in correspondence with the cavity mode wavelength (λem = 466 nm, in the reflectance spectrum) due to a rearrangement
of the photonic density of states (DOS) (Supporting Information Section 4).32 This is
confirmed by time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements carried out using
a pulsed laser source (λexcitation = 400 nm) with
low excitation power (10–50 nW) at room temperature. Figure 2c shows typical PL
radiative decays of PFO infiltrated in the cavity at wavelengths corresponding
to the cavity mode (λ = 450–480 nm); PL decay time constants
and intensities are reported in the table. TRPL shows a faster decay
time of PFO emission when infiltrated inside the PSiMC (blue line)
than when infiltrated inside the PSi reference (red line). It is worth
restating that the reference PSi structure consists of a simple porous
silicon layer with constant porosity (i.e., constant refractive index) that does not provide any photonic
effect on the emitting material and its DOS.

Interestingly,
the PL temporal decay curve is best fit by a biexponential
function (I(t) = I0 + I1e–t/τ1 + I2e–t/τ2). The need for a biexponential fitting
is not surprising for the infiltrated polymer, given the large surface/volume
ratio of the regions in which the polymer is embedded, which can strongly
influence the physical properties of the emitter.33 This is in agreement with the physical model of the luminescence
of conjugated polymers originating from both strongly bound intramolecular
excitons (primary exponential) and more weakly bound interchain states
(secondary exponential, with a longer decay time).34−39 In our system the longer decay time can be assigned either to the
polymer interaction with the SiO2 nanostructure or to the
formation of polymer aggregates inside the pores. The time-constant
values of PL reported in Figure 2 provide clear evidence of the modification of the
decay rates induced by the photonic feedback structure. Specifically,
we observe a significant reduction (∼57% for τ1) of the primary exponential decay time, which can be ascribed to
a modified exciton recombination time when the polymer is infiltrated
in the PSiMC and confirms the rearrangement of the DOS inside the
cavity at the resonance wavelength. Calculation of the ratio between
spontaneous emission lifetime of a dipole embedded in a nonresonant
medium and of a dipole located inside the microcavity at the lasing/resonance
wavelength yields τ1Ref/τ1MC ≈
1.83 (obtained from experimental data in Figure 2c, table), from which a Purcell factor Fp ≈ 1.9 is estimated according to the
literature.40−42 A value of Fp > 1
supports
the enhancing of spontaneous emission rate in resonant microcavities32,43 through a Purcell effect.44,45

The redistribution
of the DOS induced by the PSiMC is further corroborated
by the observation of slower decay time of the PL at wavelengths outside
the cavity mode in correspondence with the photonic stop-band, compared
to that on the PSi reference (Supporting Information Section 4).

Modification of the density of states of the PFO
host in PSiMCs
and the relatively high Q of PSiMCs is a clear indication
that porous silicon microcavities represent a suitable feedback structure
for an organic laser.

Lasing Action from PSi/PFO Microcavity
Lasing of PFO-infiltrated
PSiMC is investigated using a Ti-sapphire laser (λex = 400 nm, 150 fs, 2 kHz, spot diameter 100 μm) as a pumping
source and collecting the emission spectra as a function of pump power
at normal incidence. A sketch of the experimental setup used is shown
in Supporting Information Section 5. Specifically,
the PFO-infiltrated PSiMC was placed with the 30-bilayer DBR facing
the laser pump and the 10-bilayer DBR facing the collection lens.
This configuration permits maximizing the emission of PFO inside the
cavity in the collection direction. In fact, light emitted from PFO
inside the cavity at the resonant wavelength in the direction of the
laser pump is reflected back to the collection direction from the
uneven 20-bilayer of the DBR.

Figure 3a shows the experimental PL spectra of an
asymmetric PFO-infiltrated PSiMC for pump energies per pulse from
0.55 to 30 nJ. At low excitation energies (below 2 nJ, inset in Figure 3a) the PL spectrum
shows a sharp peak at 466 nm with fwhm = 2.4 nm, which corresponds
to the defect mode wavelength of the PFO-infiltrated PSiMC, in good
agreement with the PL spectrum under CW excitation of Figure 2(e). A broader PL band is observed
at 475 nm, which corresponds to the unmodified emission of PFO, with
intensity comparable to that of the cavity mode at 466 nm. Above a
pump energy of 5 nJ (corresponding to a fluence of ∼15 μJ/cm2) the peak at 466 nm narrows (fwhm = 1.35 nm at 5 nJ) and
its intensity increases nonlinearly with the excitation energy. This
is apparent in Figure 3(b), which shows both output power and mode width (fwhm) of the laser
line (466 nm) of the PFO-infiltrated PSiMC as a function of the input
pump energy. The PL emission at 466 nm is best fit with two Gaussian
curves, both centered at 466 nm, with the higher intensity, sharper
component assigned to the single mode laser emission of PFO infiltrated
into the PSiMC and the lower intensity, broader component (fwhm ∼6–8
nm) assigned to unmodified PL collected by the collimation lens in
our experimental setup.

asymmetric PFO-infiltrated PSiMC for different pump energies per pulse
in the range 0.55 to 30 nJ. Inset: PL spectra collected below (blue
line, intensity values are multiplied ×60) and above (red line)
the lasing threshold. (b) PL intensity (blue squares) and mode width
(fwhm) (red dots) of the laser line (at 466 nm) of the PFO-infiltrated
PSiMC as a function of the input energy. Above an excitation energy
per pulse of 5 nJ (i.e., fluence
of 15 μJ/cm2) the peak at 466 nm narrows (fwhm =
1.35 nm at 5 nJ) and its intensity increases superlinearly with the
pump energy. The intensity of the emission measured outside the cavity
mode (at 475 nm) is significantly lower than that at 466 nm and increases
linearly with the pump energy. (c) PL spectra of PFO when infiltrated
in the PSi reference with constant porosity, for different pump energies
per pulse in the range 50 to 1600 nJ, showing a line shape similar
to that measured under CW excitation regardless of the pump energy
value. (d) PL intensity (blue squares) and mode width (red squares)
of PFO when infiltrated in the PSi reference, measured at 465 nm,
corresponding to the 0–2 transition. PL intensity increases
linearly with the pump energy, and no line narrowing occurs for the
PSi reference.

We claim that the strong
nonlinear increase of the PL intensity
at 466 nm, together with the perfect matching of the sharp PL emission
line and cavity resonant mode (both at 466 nm), is a clear indication
of lasing action from PFO infiltrated inside the PSiMC. Accordingly,
we identify the excitation energy per pulse of 5 nJ (∼15 μJ/cm2) as the lasing threshold of our PFO-infiltrated PSiMC. This
is in good agreement with the theoretical value calculated in Supporting Information Section 6. Interestingly,
this value is comparable to that of best state-of-the-art PFO lasers,26−28 thus confirming the high quality of the photonic feedback structure
achieved using porous silicon.

Note that the PL intensity at
475 nm (green line and square, Figure 3(b)) always increases
linearly with the pump energy, thus confirming that no stimulated
emission (i.e., only spontaneous
emission) occurs outside the resonant mode of the cavity. The ratio
between PL intensity of resonant and nonresonant modes43,46 (i.e., between stimulated and
spontaneous emission, Supporting Information Section 6) further confirms the lasing threshold of about 5 nJ (15
μJ/cm2).

At high input energies, we observe
that the width of the laser
line slightly increases upon increasing the excitation fluence (Figure 3(b)), which is a
fingerprint for pulsed pumped organic lasers operating in the gain
switching regime.47,48

To evaluate the operating
stability of the hybrid PFO/PSi laser
with time, the PFO-infiltrated PSiMC was irradiated with a laser energy
of 50 nJ, which is 10 times higher than the lasing threshold, yielding
only a ∼40% decay of the PL intensity at the lasing wavelength
after 6 min of irradiation (i.e.,
7.2 × 105 pulses). These values are in good agreement
with organic semiconductor and solid-state dye lasers, whose operating
lifetimes are typically on the order of 105 to 107 pulses49 (Supporting Information Section 7).

To rule out that the observed
effect on the PFO-infiltrated PSiMC
is related to ASE, PL spectra are also collected at the output of
the PFO-infiltrated PSi reference for excitation energy per pulse
from 50 to 1600 nJ using the same experimental setup. Figure 3c shows that the PL spectra
of PFO when infiltrated in the PSi reference with constant porosity
have a line shape similar to that measured under CW excitation (shown
in Figure 2b), regardless
of the excitation energy (Supporting Information Section 8). Furthermore, PL intensity increases linearly with the
pump energy, and no line narrowing occurs for the PSi reference (Figure 3d).

Furthermore,
lasing from PFO-infiltrated PSiMC is also observed
for a microcavity designed to have a resonance wavelength red-shifted
(591 nm) with respect to PFO emission (Supporting Information Section 9). In this case, the PSiMC was properly
rotated by 50° to blue-shift the stop-band thanks to angular
dispersion of photonic crystal structures so as to overlap the emission
spectrum of the PFO (Supporting Information Section 9). This result further corroborates high quality in fabrication
and good flexibility in operation of the proposed PSi-based laser.

Conclusion
In this work we reported on a ground-breaking
approach for the
fabrication of a monolithic low-threshold silicon-based hybrid laser via drop-casting infiltration of transparent nanostructured
porous silicon resonant cavities with a polymer emitter.

As
a proof-of-concept, fabrication of a blue-emitting hybrid laser
by infiltration of PFO within a PSiMC is successfully reported. The
laser features a single mode laser line at 466 nm (mode width ∼1.3
nm) with an exceptionally low threshold (input energy per pulse ∼5
nJ, fluence ∼15 μJ/cm2). Furthermore, a significant
modification of the density of states of PFO when infiltrated in the
PSiMC indicates that a Purcell effect also takes place.

The
laser fabrication is low-cost, highly reliable, and up-scalable.
It is based on the preparation of a monolithic PSiMC by one-step electrochemical
etching, subsequent thermal oxidation, transfer-printing to a PDMS
slab, and final drop-casting of PFO into the microcavity. The laser
fabrication is also very flexible. In fact, it is possible to effectively
tune the laser wavelength by simply shifting the PSiMC resonant wavelength
and infiltrating a suitable polymer with emission matching the resonant
mode of the PSiMC. Moreover, patterning of the microcavity down to
a few micrometers in size can be carried out by standard photolithography.

These results are significant for the development of low-cost,
low-threshold silicon-based lasers operating from the visible to the
near-infrared range, which could be exploited in many applications,
including silicon photonics, ultrasensitive biosensors, and personalized
nanomedicine. Electrical pumping, for which the majority of the aforementioned
applications would benefit from, remains a challenging goal to be
achieved with hybrid lasers though, due to both low carrier mobility
and triplet generation in organic optical-gain materials. Nevertheless,
the proposed PSi/organic hybrid laser could represent an effective
proof-of-concept platform for the development of indirect electrically-pumped
lasers, where an efficient electrically-driven light source is used
to optically pump the PSi/organic laser, leveraging the high quality
of the PSi feedback structure and, in turn, the low-energy lasing threshold exhibited by this class
of lasers.

Methods
Preparation of PSiMC and
PSi Reference
Porous silicon
microcavities and PSi reference interferometers were prepared by anodic
etching of highly doped p-type crystalline silicon (boron-doped, ⟨100⟩-oriented,
resistivity of 0.8–1.2 mΩcm, Siltronix, Inc.). The electrochemical
etching was carried out in a homemade Teflon cell using a two-electrode
configuration, with the silicon substrate (area of 2.835 cm2) placed onto an aluminum flat anode and a platinum coil immersed
in the solution of HF (48%)/EtOH (3:1 v/v) and acting as cathode.
A source measure unit (SMU) (Keithley 2610), configured as current
source and voltage meter, was used to set the etching current density,
both value and profile, and simultaneously monitor the voltage drop
between silicon and platinum electrodes.

First,
a PSi sacrificial layer was etched at a constant current density of
400 mA/cm2 for 15 s and immediately dissolved by dissolution
in a NaOH (1 M in deionized (DI) water)/EtOH (9:1 v/v) solution. This
step is necessary to avoid the presence of a top parasitic porous
silicon layer, with pores smaller than 10 nm due to chemical contamination
of the silicon surface, which could strongly impact the preparation
of PSi optical structures. After removal of the PSi sacrificial layer,
the silicon samples were rinsed with deionized water and ethanol,
gently dried under nitrogen flow, then used for the etching of a second
PSi optical structure, either the PSiMC or the PSi reference interferometer.

For the etching of the PSiMC we set a square-wave current density
profile with values of 400 and 20 mA/cm2 to obtain a periodic
modulation of the PSi porosity between 77% and 59%, respectively,
and, in turn, of the PSi refractive index varying between n400 = 1.28 RIU and n20 = 1.55 RIU (at 550 nm), yielding a contrast of 0.27 RIU. The porosity
values and, in turn, the refractive index values of the PSi layers
prepared with the aforementioned current densities were extracted
from reflectance spectra collected from PSi homogeneous layers etched
at constant current density and, in turn, with constant porosity.50

The PSiMC was designed with a half-wavelength
defect sandwiched
between quarter-wavelength DBRs with 30 (top) and 10 (bottom) bilayers.
The PSiMC with stop-band at 525 nm as-prepared was etched using a
square-wave etching current profile with a period of 4.5 s and duty
cycle of 0.9 (i.e., t400 = 4.95 s, t20 = 0.55 s),
to take into account the different etching speeds at different etching
current densities. The etching time of the two current density values
is tuned to ensure that the optical thickness of both high- and low-porosity
layers is one-quarter of the central wavelength of the photonic stop-band
of the DBRs. Notice that, the etching time is doubled during the etching
of the defect layer of the cavity to obtain an optical thickness that
is half the stop-band central wavelength. The defect layer is etched
at 20 mA/cm2 to have a low porosity value and, in turn,
a high refractive index value that allows the electromagnetic field
to be concentrated inside the cavity. The overall etching process
gives rise to a PSiMC with a total thickness of ∼15 μm.

The PSi reference interferometer was prepared at a constant etching
current of 100 mA/cm2 for 350 s to obtain a homogeneous
PSi layer with constant porosity of 66% and thickness of ∼15
μm, comparable to average porosity and total thickness of the
PSiMC.

After preparation of the PSi optical structures, we applied
a constant
current density of 800 mA/cm2 for 0.6 s to produce a pseudo-electropolishing
of the silicon underneath the cavity, though leaving the microcavities
still anchored to bulk silicon. The as-prepared samples are then rinsed
with 2-propanol and pentane and gently dried under nitrogen flow to
obtain a crack-free PSi layer.

Eventually, samples are thermally
oxidized in a muffle furnace
(ZB 1, ASAL) at 750 °C for 1:30 h, with a ramp rate of 12 °C/min,
in ambient conditions.

Transfer-Printing of PSiMC onto PDMS
PDMS slabs (Sylgard
184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) were prepared by mixing base and
curing agent in a ratio 10:1 by weight. The resulting mix was cast
onto a Petri dish and degassed under vacuum for 30 min to avoid the
presence of air bubbles trapped inside it. The Petri dish containing
the mix was then placed into an oven at 110 °C for 1 h to achieve
polymer cross-linking. Eventually, the PDMS disks were properly cut
into slabs, which were placed onto the silicon chips containing either
the oxidized PSiMC or the PSi reference and used to gently peel the
PSi structures off the silicon substrate and transfer them onto the
PDMS slab.

Infiltration of PFO into PSiMC
Poly(9,9)-dioctylfluorene
(20 kDa. Aldrich) was used as received, without further purification.
A PFO solution was prepared by dissolving 1% wt in toluene at room
temperature. The infiltration was performed by dropping 20 μL
of the polymer solution onto the PSiMC, then allowing the solvent
to evaporate in ambient conditions.

Morphological and Optical
Characterization of PSi/PFO Microcavities
Reflectance and
transmittance spectra were collected with an Ocean
Optics H4000+ES spectrometer in combination with a fiber-coupled Ocean
Optics DH-2000 deuterium-halogen source. CW photoluminescence measurements
were carried out with the same spectrometer by using a 405 nm CW laser
diode (Thorlabs). The porosity of the PSi layers was computationally
evaluated by fitting experimental reflectance spectra of as-prepared
PSi samples with a homemade software developed in Matlab (MathWorks,
USA). Time-resolved PL measurements were carried out using a femtosecond
laser source coupled to a streak camera detection system (Hamamatsu
C5680). A Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II, pulse bandwidths
of ∼100 fs, repetition rate of 80 MHz, and power of 10–50
nW) was used to pump a second-harmonic crystal (barium borate) to
tune the pump wavelength to 400 nm.

Lasing experiments were
performed using an amplified Ti:sapphire laser with 2 mJ output energy
and 2 kHz repetition rate at 400 nm. The laser power was set using
a tunable optical density. The samples were placed with the 30-bilayer
stack facing the focused laser pump and the 10-bilayer stack facing
the collection lens. The emitted light was collected through a spherical
collimation lens connected to a fiber-coupled spectrometer (Avantes
AvaSpec-ULS2048XL-EVO).

SEM images were taken using a Zeiss
ULTRA55 microscope.
