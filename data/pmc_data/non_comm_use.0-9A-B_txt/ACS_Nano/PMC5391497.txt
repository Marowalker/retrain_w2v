When
a pristine nanoparticle (NP) encounters a biological fluid,
biomolecules spontaneously form adsorption layers around the NP, called
“protein corona”. The corona composition depends on
the time-dependent environmental conditions and determines the NP’s
fate within living organisms. Understanding how the corona evolves
is fundamental in nanotoxicology as well as medical applications.
However, the process of corona formation is challenging due to the
large number of molecules involved and to the large span of relevant
time scales ranging from 100 μs, hard to probe in experiments,
to hours, out of reach of all-atoms simulations. Here we combine experiments,
simulations, and theory to study (i) the corona kinetics (over 10–3–103 s) and (ii) its final composition
for silica NPs in a model plasma made of three blood proteins (human
serum albumin, transferrin, and fibrinogen). When computer simulations
are calibrated by experimental protein–NP binding affinities
measured in single-protein solutions, the theoretical model correctly
reproduces competitive protein replacement as proven by independent
experiments. When we change the order of administration of the three
proteins, we observe a memory effect in the final
corona composition that we can explain within our model. Our combined
experimental and computational approach is a step toward the development
of systematic prediction and control of protein–NP corona composition
based on a hierarchy of equilibrium protein binding constants.

==== Body
The interaction
of NPs with
biological media is key in the transport of NPs across the cell membrane.
When NPs are exposed to fluids that contain proteins and other biomolecules,
part of those biomolecules are immediately adsorbed forming the so-called
“protein corona”. This corona is believed to depend
on the different biological environments crossed by the NP as well
as on the current surroundings.1,2 Therefore, layers of
adsorbed proteins that are formed while the NPs move from a biological
milieu to another evolve as the concentration of protein and the media
composition change.3

Nowadays it
is generally accepted that part of the proteins in
the corona can remain for a relevant time on the NP surface (hard
corona),4 possibly preventing the adsorption
of other molecules. Other proteins, instead, dynamically exchange
with those in solution (soft corona).5,6 Nevertheless,
our knowledge about the dynamic exchange of the corona in response
to changes in the composition of the milieu is still very limited.
Due to the relevant role that the evolution of the corona plays in
the way that NPs interact with biological systems, e.g., in their targeting of specific cellular receptors,7 it is crucial for any possible biological application8 to understand how the processes of protein adsorption
and exchange occur in the corona.9 Hence,
there is a need for an accurate modeling of the kinetics of the protein
corona in order to decipher the biological identity of the NPs.

Coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations have proven to be a powerful
tool for the study of NPs interacting with biological systems at the
macromolecular scale.10,11 Recently Vilaseca et
al. developed a computational approach to simulate the adsorption
of proteins on flat surfaces.12 These theoretical
results suggest that the corona composition, after exposure to a multicomponent
system, undergoes a relaxation scenario. In particular, fast-diffusing
but weakly adsorbing proteins reach the surface first, but are replaced
by strong-binding proteins next.

The mechanism of formation
of the corona of the NP can be separated
into two main stages: (i) the bare NP enters the biological environment
and comes in contact with biomolecules that first adsorb forming the
initial corona; and (ii) the corona composition starts to evolve due
to competition between proteins. An atomistic description of such
a complex mechanism of formation and evolution of the protein corona
is at the moment computationally unfeasible and, more importantly,
avoidable. Here we show that by combining experiments, computer simulations,
and theory, we are able to develop an approach that allows us to predict
the corona composition in a variety of cases. We present results for
a three-component model plasma, and we describe how the approach can
be extended in a systematic way to more complex protein solutions.

We consider a solution composed of different combinations of the
following representative blood plasma proteins: human serum albumin
(HSA), transferrin (Tf), and human fibrinogen (Fib). These proteins
are very numerous in plasma and are present in the corona of silica
(SiO2) NPs.13 HSA is the most
abundant protein in plasma, representing almost 55% of its composition.14 It is a globular protein, with a small mass
of 67 kDa, that regulates the osmotic pressure of plasma. Tf
has a concentration in plasma of 3 mg/mL, with a mass of about 80 kDa.
This protein transports iron through the body and maintains the iron
homeostasis. Fib is a rod-like protein with a large mass of 340 kDa
and has a key role in coagulation. Its concentration in plasma varies
from 1.7 to 4.5 mg/mL.

We measure the affinity of each protein
for the silica NPs using
two independent approaches, namely differential centrifugal sedimentation
(DCS) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). While the DCS characterization9,15−17 is performed by extracting the NPs from the solution,
with MST we probe the interactions of NPs with proteins directly in
solution. Using a combination of these two experimental techniques,
we obtain reliable binding constants for each of the individual proteins
interacting with silica NPs. Next, we use the measured NP affinities—and
other known parameters—of the proteins to define a CG model
that includes protein–NP and protein–protein interactions,
up to three-body contributions. Yet the model is simple enough to
allow us to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for NPs in
binary and ternary protein solutions up to 10 s. This time scale is
out of reach of atomistic simulations and approaches the lower limit
of the experimental time resolution. However, the relevant time scale
for the experiments and the biological applications is as long as
hours. Therefore, we develop an original theoretical approach, based
on the non-Langmuir differential rate equation (NLDRE), to extrapolate
the adsorption kinetics over hours. We test our theoretical predictions
about the adsorption kinetics by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
(FCS). With this technique, we label one protein species at a time
and follow its binding on NPs precoated with other proteins. This
allows us to monitor the adsorption kinetics and the displacement
from a precoated corona by competitive binding. Finally, we verify
our theoretical predictions about the relative composition of the
hard corona using sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE).

Results and Discussion
Binding Affinities Measurements in Single-Protein
Solutions
We prepare solutions of HSA, Tf, and Fib with silica
NPs and measure
by DCS the change in the sedimentation time with respect to conditions
with no proteins (eq 3 and Figure 1a). By
MST, we measure the normalized relative fluorescence Fnorm of fluorescently labeled NPs in a monocomponent protein
solution under a thermal gradient (eq 4 and Figure 1b). We fit both quantities (Figure 1) with the law of mass action, eq S1 in Supporting Information (SI), in the limit of
low NP concentration, whose solution Γeq is the normalized
surface coverage, as a function of the protein concentration CP: 1  where KD for each
of the three proteins separately (Table 1) is the only fitting parameter of the experimental
data and marks the concentration at which Γeq = 0.5.
The estimates from the two techniques agree in order of magnitude,
with KDFib ≪KDTf < KDHSA. Hence we establish a hierachy
of the tendency to absorb on the NP surface, that for Fib is much
larger than for Tf and for Tf larger than for HSA.

The CG Model
Our goal is to unveil the molecular mechanisms
that regulate the corona formation, and simulations are potentially
helpful to this aim. However, a direct comparison with experiments
is unfeasible with all-atoms simulations. Hence, we resort to a model
where we coarse-grain many degrees of freedom, and in this way, we
step up the size and duration of our MD simulations, approaching the
experimental scale.

In our CG approach, we introduce effective
potentials for protein–NP and protein–protein (two-body
and three-body interactions) with implicit solvent. For the protein–NP
effective interaction, we adopt a description within the framework
of the well-established DLVO theory for colloidal dispersions (Figure 2a and eq S8 in SI).18,19

silica NP (sketched as a portion of a large sphere on the left) and

for Fib). For sake of clarity, in the panel we sketch only the HSA
as an ellipsoid (on the right). (b) The protein–protein interaction

main panel). (c) Snapshot of the simulation box showing the NP (golden
sphere in the center) suspended in the protein solution (small spheres).
The highlighted red zone corresponds to the buffer region, which we
use to maintain the protein concentration constant as in the experimental
setup.

For the two-body protein–protein
effective interaction,
we follow Vilaseca et al.12 and consider an interaction potential that encodes two different
conformations for each protein (eq S9 in SI and Figure 2b). This
model, adopted to describe the competition among proteins near a surface,
compares well with the experimental data without preassumptions about
the adsorption mechanisms or the adsorption rates.

At high concentrations
of protein, we introduce a three-body correction
to the protein–protein interactions. We find that this term
is essential to get simulation results consistent with the experimental
data. This effective three-body interaction (eq S10 in SI) is due to correlations between pairs of proteins
near the surface of the NP and could arise from conformational changes
of surface-adsorbed proteins.

The model’s
parameters (Tables 2 and S1 in SI) are all known but the
DLVO’s Hamaker constant AH in eq
S8 in SI. We estimate AH (Figure S3 in SI) based on
our knowledge of the binding affinities KDFib, KDTf, and KDHSA given by the eq 1 derived
from the fit of the experimental
data.

Competitive Protein Adsorption in Two-Component
Protein Solutions
In order to test the competitive adsorption
between different kinds
of proteins, we consider solutions containing two among the three
proteins, HSA, Tf, and Fib. To allow a better comparison between simulations
and experiments, we follow a sequential protocol in which we introduce
one kind of protein at a time into the initial NP suspension.

First, we perform simulations of silica NPs suspensions, at a concentration
of 100 μg/mL, with HSA at different concentrations, chosen within
the range of accessible experimental values. After equilibrating the
precoating, we add to the solution Fib at 5 μg/mL concentration
and study the adsorption kinetics of Fib (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Two-component protein solution: Competitive
adsorption of Fib on
silica NPs precoated with HSA at different concentrations. (a) Simulation
results (open symbols without error bars) of the fraction bound of
adsorbed Fib as a function of time are extrapolated to large time-scales,
using the NLDRE theory (lines), to allow us to compare our predictions
with our experimental data (symbols with error bars). The agreement
is excellent. Concentrations are 5 μg/mL for Fib, 100 μg/mL
for silica NPs, and for the lines from top to bottom, 0.00, 0.18,
0.35, 0.70, 1.00, 3.50, 7.00, and 10.00 mg/mL for HSA. Lines and symbols
with matching colors correspond to the same HSA concentration. Inset:
Schematic representation of Fib (green) displacing HSA (red) on the
NP surface (golden). (b) Relative surface mass concentration of HSA
(red) and Fib (green) after 120 min as a function of the HSA concentration
in solution, as predicted from NLDRE theory (open symbols connected
by a dashed line), and compared with data from SDS-PAGE (symbols with
error bars).

Because KDFib ≪ KDHSA, we expect that
Fib would displace the adsorbed HSA proteins. However, we find a strong
dependence of the Fib adsorption kinetics on the concentration of
HSA. The simulations clearly show that the rate of adsorption of Fib
decreases for increasing concentration of HSA in solution. In particular,
after 10 s of simulated time, we find that the Fib adsorbed on the
NP decreases from ≃90% to ≃35% when the HSA concentration
changes from 0 to 10 mg/mL, respectively.

To better understand
this effect with the numerical approach, simulations
much longer than those achievable within a reasonable time would be
necessary. However, we develop an analytic theory that allows us to
extrapolate our numerical results to physiologically relevant time
scales (∼1 h). Our NLDRE theory is based on the law of mass
action and differs from the standard Langmuir theory of adsorption
because we do not assume constant adsorption rates. The essential
parameters of our theory are the binding affinities and the adsorption/desorption
rates of the molecules, that we assume to be dependent on each protein
surface coverage and the concentration of NPs and proteins. As explained
in SI, these parameters can be fitted from
adsorption data at an early stage.

We use the NLDRE theory to
extrapolate the long-time behavior of
the system (Figure 3) and predict that at the highest HSA concentration (10 mg/mL), it
would take more than 5 min for Fib to displace HSA and to have more
than 50% of Fib adsorbed, despite the much higher tendency of Fib
to adsorb on the NP surface. Our theory predicts that after 30 min,
the Fib adsorption kinetics on NPs precoated with HSA at 10 mg/mL
concentration is still relatively slower compared to pristine NPs
(Figure 3) and that
the saturation level is reached within the time frame of 100 min (Figure 3b).

In order
to test our theoretical predictions, we perform experiments
following the same protocol as in the simulations, i.e., adding Fib at 5 μg/mL concentration to
silica NPs (at 100 μg/mL) precoated with HSA at different
concentrations. We study the adsorption kinetics by estimating the
Fib fraction bound with FCS. The faction bound is defined in eq 6. We verify that the Fib
adsorption kinetics change due to the presence of competing proteins
on the corona with an overall excellent agreement with our theoretical
predictions (Figure 3a).

We repeat the experiment with different HSA incubation
times, remove
the adsorbed proteins from the NP surface, separate them using SDS-PAGE
technique (Figure S4 in SI), and finally
estimate the relative mass of each protein on the NP surface by densitometry
(Figure 3b). We find
that the experimental data follow our theory with very good agreement,
confirming the predictive capability of the theory for binary solutions.

Furthermore, we test that the theory can be applied to other binary
solutions. In particular, we repeat simulations, theoretical calculations,
and experiments using Tf instead of HSA during the precoating step
and then adding Fib in solution. Again, we find that our theory for
binary solutions, based on short-time simulations, allows us to make
predictions about the adsorption kinetics in excellent agreement with
the experiments (Figure S5 in SI).

Competitive
Protein Adsorption in Three-Component Protein Solutions
To
verify if our approach can be extended in a systematic way to
more complex protein solutions, we apply the same procedure to a ternary
suspension with HSA, Tf, and Fib. In this case, we follow a three
steps exposure protocol: (i) we first incubate NPs in HSA, (ii) we
add Tf in solution expecting competition with HSA for the NP surface,
and (iii) we finally add Fib that will compete with both Tf and HSA
for the corona (Figure 4a).

representation of the three-steps adsorption protocol with Fib (green)
displacing Tf (blue) and HSA (red) on the NP surface (golden). (b)
Normalized surface coverage, eq 1, of HSA (red circles, at concentration 0.07 mg/mL),
TF (blue squares, at 0.07 mg/mL), and Fib (green triangles, at 5 μg/mL)
adsorbed on 100 μg/mL silica NPs as a function of time, calculated
by simulations at short times (t ≤ 0.1 min,
Figure S6 in SI) and extrapolated to long
time (t ≥ 200 min) by the NLDRE theory (dotted
line for HSA, dot-dashed line for Tf, dashed line for Fib, and solid
line for the total surface coverage). In simulations we precoat the
NPs first with HSA, until equilibrium, and next with Tf, until equilibrium,
before adding Fib at t = 0. The prediction for Fib
compares well with the fraction bound of Fib measured by FCS (symbols
with error bars) for t ≥ 3 min. The two sets
of experimental data refer to (circles) first precoating with HSA
for 1 h and next with Tf for 2 h and to (squares) first Tf (1 h) and
next HSA (2 h). The saturation value for the Fib surface coverage
is reached for t ≈ 10 min. Inset: Fraction
bound, eq 6, of adsorbed
proteins corresponding to the surface coverage in the main panel in
double-logarithmic scale. (c) Same as in panel b but for HSA and Tf
at 3.5 mg/mL concentrations. In this case, the saturation value
for the Fib surface coverage is reached for t ≃
50 min.

As for the binary solution, we
run short-time simulations for a
selected number of cases. Specifically, we consider equal concentrations
for HSA and Tf. We first simulate the precoating of silica NPs (at
100 μg/mL) with HSA at 0.07 mg/mL until the system is equilibrated.
Then we run the simulation adding Tf (at 0.07 mg/mL) until a stable
corona of HSA and Tf is formed. Then we add Fib (at 5 μg/mL)
and perform a simulation for ≃0.1 min. Finally, we calculate
the long-time behavior of the Fib adsorption using our NLDRE theory.
We predict that the corona kinetics reaches the saturation of Fib
in ≈10 min (Figure 4b).

As in the case of the two-component solution, we
test the theoretical
prediction by FCS experiments. In particular, we measure the Fib fraction
bound after incubating the NPs for 1 h with HSA and, later, for another
hour with Tf, both at 0.07 mg/mL concentration (Figure 4a). The comparison of the experimental data with the theoretical
prediction is, also for this ternary solution, very good (Figure 4b).

We find
a similar good agreement between the experiments (Figure 4c) and the theoretical
predictions when we consider the case of NPs sequentially precoated
with HSA and Tf at higher concentrations (3.5 mg/mL each). In this
case the theory predicts a large slowing down of the protein corona
kinetics with respect to the case at lower HSA and Tf concentration,
with a saturation of Fib only after ≈50 min (Figure 4c). Experiments confirm this
prediction.

We observe that the competition with HSA and Tf
makes the Fib adsorption
slightly slower than the competition with solely HSA at a comparable
total mass concentration. For example, for HSA and Tf at 0.07 mg/mL,
the time needed for reaching 50% of Fib fraction bound is t ≃ 0.2 min (Figure 4b), while for HSA at 0.18 mg/mL, it is t ≃ 0.1 min (Figure 3). However, the time difference between the two cases is negligible
when we compare the Fib adsorption kinetics for HSA and Tf at 3.5 mg/mL (Figure 4c) and for HSA at 7.0 mg/mL (Figure 3). This could be interpreted as a consequence
of the fact that the binding affinities of HSA and Tf are comparable
and both much higher than that of Fib, hence the Fib kinetics is regulated
only by the total mass concentration of the competing proteins.

Furthermore, we find, both in simulations and experiments, that
within the error bar, there is no difference in Fib kinetics if we
incubate first with HSA and then add Tf or vice versa (Figure S7 in SI). However, our experiments
show that the kinetics before the addition of Fib
displays a memory effect if we change the incubation
order, as we discuss in the next section.

Memory Effects in Competitive
Protein Adsorption of HSA and
Tf
After a preliminary screening showing differences in the
kinetics when we invert the incubation sequence of HSA and Tf, we
investigate experimentally the memory effect considering two different
incubation protocols. In protocol A, we first incubate the silica
NP for 1 h with HSA at 3.5 mg/mL, then we add Tf at the same concentration
(3.5 mg/mL) for another hour. In protocol B, we invert the order of
incubation, first Tf and next HSA, with the same concentrations and
times. After each protocol, we wash the NP to remove unbound proteins,
and next we remove the attached proteins and electrophoretically separate
them inside a gel matrix (SDS-PAGE gel analysis, Figure 5a). Finally, after visualization,
we quantify the relative abundance of each protein.

Figure 5 Memory effect in experiments
and simulations when we invert the
NP incubation order of HSA and Tf both at 3.5 mg/mL concentration.
(a) SDS-PAGE gel analysis after incubating the NP in HSA and Tf, in
different orders: (from left to right, as indicated by labels) HSA
alone; protocol A with HSA first and Tf second (three different samples);
Tf alone; protocol B with Tf first and HSA second (three different
samples). (b) Densitometry results for the percent of protein corona
composition after the gel analysis with NP incubation with HSA (red)
and Tf (blue) following the same protocols as in panel a (as indicated
by the labels on the bottom). The error bars are estimated as statistical
deviation among the three independent samples in panel a. Results
are calculated after subtracting background noise. (c) Simulation
results for the kinetics of the competitive protein adsorption of
the model with three-body interaction between HSA, Tf, and NP (eq
S10 in SI): We show the relative protein
adsorption on the NP of Tf (blue) and HSA (red), both at 3.5 mg/mL
concentration, following the two protocols (protocol A: circle for
Tf and squares for HSA, protocol B: triangles up for Tf and triangles
down for HSA), as a function of time t. In both protocols,
the incubation time is tinc = 0.075 s,
and the quantities are normalized to the value of the main component
at tinc. (d) Relative surface mass concentration
from simulations in panel c after t = 0.3 s, to compare
with experimental results in panel b.

We find that the final amount of each protein depends on
the protocol.
Specifically, the first incubated protein is always more abundant
in the corona at the end of the process (Figure 5b). We repeat the experiments for HSA and
Tf at smaller concentration, 0.07 mg/mL (Figure S8 in SI), and find the same qualitative result, suggesting
that the memory effect does not depend strongly on the initial protein
concentrations. On the other hand, by adding Fib after each incubation
protocol, we do not find any strong effect on the Fib adsorption (Figure
S7 in SI), i.e., the memory effect occurs in our samples before the addition of
Fib.

Based on these experimental evidence, we focus on investigating
the possible mechanism causing the memory effect for the competitive
adsorption between HSA and Tf. In particular, we compare the experiments
with the results from our computational model. We observe that for
the model defined by eqs S8 and S9 in SI, the two different incubation protocols lead to the same corona
after a transient time (Figure S9 in SI). Therefore, the memory effect implies the existence of other interactions
among proteins and NP beside those described by eqs S8 and S9 in SI. Hence we hypothesize that the protein adsorption
on the NP induces a change in the protein–protein interaction.
This change can be interpreted as a consequence of a protein conformational
variation upon adsorption. Specifically, we assume that the change
can be modeled by a three-body interaction between the proteins and
the NP (eq S10 in SI).

We find that
our hypothesis is sufficient to simulate the memory
effect (Figure 5c,d).
Hence the memory effect can be interpreted as a consequence of how
the adsorption on the NP changes the interaction of the first-incubated
protein with those adsorbed at a later time, e.g., due to conformational variations, hampering the replacement
of the first by the latter proteins.

Conclusions
We
study by experiments, simulations and theory the kinetics of
the protein corona forming on 100 nm silica NPs suspended in a ternary
solution made of HSA, Tf, and Fib. With the goal of developing a predictive
computational model based on a limited knowledge of the protein–NP
interactions, we first evaluate the NP binding affinities of each
of these three proteins in monocomponent solutions by DCS and MST.
We use the estimates of KDFib ≪KDTf < KDHSA as parameters in a CG model for the protein–NP interactions
and perform ≈10 s numerical simulations of the model for the
competitive protein adsorption on silica NP in binary solutions. To
extrapolate the Fib kinetics at physiologically relevant time scales
(∼1 h) and compare with FCS and SDS-PAGE techniques, we develop
a NLDRE theory predicting a strong slowing down of Fib adsorption
on HSA-precoated NPs compared to pristine NPs. While pristine NPs
are covered with more than 50% of the Fib in solution within seconds,
it takes more than 5 min when the NPs has been incubated with HSA
at 10 mg/mL concentration. All our results show that the Fib kinetics
slows down when the NPs are incubated with a higher HSA concentration.
Therefore, the kinetic slowdown would become even more relevant for
HSA concentrations as high as in human plasma (from 35 to 50 mg/mL).
The analysis of the Fib adsorption kinetics on NPs after Tf incubation
shows a similar slowdown and a similar good agreement between our
theoretical predictions and the experiments. We expect a stronger
kinetic effect when the competing proteins have similar affinities.
For example, our preliminary results for Fibrinogen competing with
Fibronectin show a kinetic effect lasting for tens of hours, a time-scale
relevant for the evolution of the protein corona in NP uptake scenarios.

To test further the predictive power of our computational model,
we perform ≈10 s numerical simulations of a three step exposure
protocol, first incubating the NPs with HSA, then with Tf, and finally
adding Fib. Next we extrapolate the results up to hours with the NLDRE
theory. For this ternary solution, we predict a Fib adsorption kinetics
that slows down with the total mass concentration of the two competing
proteins in a fashion comparable to the case of the binary solutions.
We understand this similarity as a consequence of the fact that both
HSA and Tf have a binding affinity orders of magnitude higher than KDFib. In this sense the relevant parameter determining the Fib adsorption
slowdown is the total mass concentration of the competing proteins
and not their relative amount. Also in this case, we test the theoretical
predictions by comparing with FCS and SDS-PAGE techniques, and we
find a very good agreement for the Fib kinetics, independent of the
incubation order.

Nevertheless, a detailed experimental analysis
of the kinetics
before the addition of Fib shows a memory effect
when we invert the order of precoating between HSA and Tf. The protein
incubated first is always more abundant in the final corona. We realize
that for reproducing this experimental feature, it is sufficient to
add to our computational model a three-body interaction among the
proteins and the NP. This additional term mimics the effect that the
protein adsorption on the NP has on the protein–protein interaction.
We interpret this mechanism as a consequence of possible irreversible
degeneration of proteins at the NP surface.

In conclusion, by
combining simulations and theory with limited
experimental information on single-protein solutions, we are able
to predict the protein corona composition in a ternary solution. We
find evidence of memory in the corona formation when
the environment changes, and we propose a mechanism that can account
for this effect. Our results show that it is possible to develop an
approach toward the prediction of the protein corona kinetics and
composition in complex milieus that are changing with time. This is
particularly relevant in those cases, e.g., in which a NP is traveling through the body. This knowledge is
key for understanding how to modulate the protein corona. As a matter
of fact, tuning the protein corona could be exploited to design specific
NP properties. It can help to better engineer drug delivery carriers
or a generation of biocomplexes for nanotheranostics. It may allow
the development of patient-optimized NPs, making use of the fact that
the protein corona will change when the NP is incubated in blood plasma
extracted from patients with different diseases.

Materials
and Methods
Experimental Approach
Silica NPs (nominal diameter
100 nm) were purchased from Polysciences Inc. (cat no. 24041). FITC-labeled
silica NPs were purchased from Kisker Biotech (cat no. PSi-G0.1).
NPs were characterized by DLS to determine their size (Figure S10
in SI) and z-potential
before use. Proteins (Fib, Tf, BSA) labeled with Alexa488 were purchased
from Invitrogen (Life Technology) and treated as recommended from
the supplier. Unlabeled Fib, holo-Tf, and HSA were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich.

Differential Centrifugation Sedimentation
DCS measures
the sedimentation time of objects. It is then possible to calculate
their diameter by assuming a value of the density of these objects
(eq 2).15 When proteins or other molecules bind to the surface of
NPs, they not only change their overall size but also the net density
of the object. This causes a change in the sedimentation properties
of the NP. It is convenient, from an experimental perspective, to
assume a density of the core material and observe the change in apparent
diameter as a function of protein concentration. The term apparent
diameter is used as the size reported does not reflect the true size
of the NP–protein complex, but it actually reflects the combination
of changes in both the size and density which occur after the formation
of the protein corona.

The diameter is computed as 2  where D is the particle diameter
(cm), η is the fluid viscosity (poise), r0 and rf are the initial and the
final radius of rotation (cm), ρNP is the particle
density (g/mL), ρf is the fluid density (g/mL), ω
is the rotational velocity (rad/s), and tS is the time required to sediment from r0 to rf (s).

Prior to DCS analysis,
silica NPs were incubated in different concentrations
of single protein solutions for 1 h at room temperature. After this,
the solution was injected neat into the spinning DCS disk. The particles
then sediment through a sucrose gradient at 30 °C ± 4 °C.
Due to the different sedimentation rates of the free protein and the
NPs, it is assumed that, upon injection, the NPs would be immediately
separated from the surrounding protein as they pass through the disk.
This gives the opportunity for proteins to desorb as the particles
are no longer in equilibrium with their surroundings. The typical
measurement time for these particles was on the order of 1–2
min.

After data acquisition, the changes in sedimentation can
be rationalized
by considering the object as more complex and modeling the sedimentation
using a core–shell model (eq 3). This assumes that the object formed of a core of
known size and density and a shell of protein of known density and
variable thickness, with apparent diameter: 3  where Da is the
apparent diameter of the NPs, Dc and ρc are the NP core diameter and density, respectively, DT is the total diameter of the core and the
shell, and ρs and ρf are the shell
and fluid densities, respectively. This equation describes a NP with
a shell composed of species with a single density.15

In all cases the particles are assumed to be spherical
and the
layers homogeneous and discrete. For most cases, a progressive increase
in shell thickness causes a nonlinear change in the sedimentation
properties. However, we observe (Figure S1d in SI) that the reported shifts can be rationalized using eq 3: For this system and suitably
small shifts (<12 nm), a linear approximation between the surface
coverage of the NP and the protein concentration is acceptable. Hence,
the apparent diameter, in this case, can be used to directly reflect
the shell thickness of proteins. Assuming that the maximum saturation
point of the curves is indicative of full surface coverage, the shell
thickness can be normalized to represent a surface coverage percentage.

DCS is not biased by agglomerates, as it measures the time each
particle takes to sediment. The time separation between the large
agglomerates, that sediment first, and the individual particles, that
sediment later, guarantees that even in the case of agglomeration,
the single particle population can be monitored. In particular, by
monitoring the main population peak in DCS, it is possible to follow
the adsorption of protein (Figure S1a–c in SI), even with colloidal instability present, most obvious
around the 50% coverage for Fib (Figure S1c in SI).

Microscale Thermophoresis
MST is
a technique for binding
studies and allows us to determine the binding affinities of the proteins
to the NPs. In a standard assay, the binder (NP) is fluorescently
labeled and kept at constant concentration, while the ligand (protein)
is not. These conditions are very useful for proteins with low binding
affinities or for measurements in complex fluids like plasma. As described
in refs (20 and 21), we measure how
the binding induces changes of the fluorescent signal in a thermal
gradient by determining the relative fluorescence: 4  where Fhot is
the fluorescence after thermodiffusion and Fcold is the initial fluorescence. By fitting Fnorm as a function of the protein concentration using
a Hill equation (eq 1), we estimate the binding affinity. However, when there is NP aggregation,
the technique averages agglomerates and single particles data, introducing
noise in the affinity constants estimate.

MST measurements were
perfomed on a Monolith NT 0.15 (NanoTemper, Germany) using 40% of
blue LED (488 nm) and 1 V IR-laser power. Laser on and off times were
set at 35 s and 5 s, respectively. Standard treated capillaries from
NanoTemper were used. FITC-labeled silica NPs were used at a constant
concentration of 0.313 mg/mL, while for the protein of interest, a
1:1 dilution series was prepared.

Fluorescence Correlation
Spectroscopy
FCS is a highly
sensitive fluorescence technique that allows for the determination
of the number and the size of particles simultaneously in solution.
By diffusing into and out of the confocal volume, labeled particles, i.e., proteins, create fluctuations in
the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence signal is temporally
correlated for the analysis. A two component fit to the time–correlation
function G(τ) is used to determine quantitatively
the amplitude and the diffusion time of the fast freely diffusing
proteins τProtein and the slower bound proteins τProtein+NP. We follow the procedure described by Rusu et al.22 and Milani et
al.5 using a two component fitting
formula: 5  From these results, we can determine the fraction
bound of proteins on the NP surface5 that
is 6  where N0 is the
initial protein number from a fit in a monocomponent solution and Nfree ≤ N0 is the amount of unbound protein after incubation with NPs.

FCS measurements were performed on a LSM10 microscope equipped with
a ConfoCor2 unit (Carl Zeiss Jena, Germany), an argon laser (488 nm),
and an apochromatic 40× water-immersion objective with a NA of
1.2 (Carl Zeiss Jena, Germany). Fluorescence emission was separated
from excitation light by using the corresponding band-pass filter
525/25 nm. All measurements were performed at room temperature (22°
C) using NUNC eight-well slides (Thermo Scientific) and a sample volume
of at least 200 μL. To avoid unwanted adsorption of proteins
to the walls, the chambers were precoated with 5 mg/mL BSA for 1 h.
Afterward the chambers were rinsed with Milli-Q to remove unbound
BSA.

SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE is a method by which proteins in
a complex mixture can be separated based on their molecular weight.
This technique has been applied previously to study the proteins which
make up the biomolecular corona.13,23 Briefly the
proteins adsorbed on the NPs are removed from their surface, denatured,
and loaded on a gel, whereby they are separated by applying an electric
field. The protein bands can subsequently be visualized by staining
the proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye.

Silica NPs (100
μg/mL, 0.5 mL) were incubated in different HSA concentrations
(0.35–7 mg/mL) for 1 h at room temperature. After that, Fib
was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. The NPs were
incubated with Fib for varying lengths of time (0–120 min),
and the times reported correspond to the incubation time with Fib
before hard corona preparation. The hard corona samples were prepared
by removing the excess proteins from the sample, achieved through
4 successive cycles of centrifugation (20000 × g, 10 min) and resuspension in PBS. The final NP pellet was suspended
in 10 μL PBS with an additional 5 μL loading buffer. The
samples were subsequently boiled for 5 min before loading on a 6–4%
discontinuous Tris-glycine gel.

The samples were run for 1 h
at 130 V. The gels were then extracted
and fixed in 40% EtOh, 10% acetic acid for 1h. Following this, the
gel was placed in 0.025% w/w Coomassie Brilliant Blue dispersed in
10% EtOH and 10% acetic acid. The gel was left overnight to stain
before imaging.

Computational and Theoretical Approach
For our computational
and theoretical calculations we used a computer cluster with dedicated
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs):CPU processors: 4× PCs with an INTEL i7-870 and
6 GB RAM, 1× PC with an INTEL i7-3770 and 8 GB RAM.

GPU processors: 4× NVIDIA GTX 460, 2× NVIDIA
GTX 660, 1× NVIDIA GTX 760, 1× NVIDIA Tesla C2075.

All machines were running under GNU/Linux Ubuntu
12.04. The
programming codes were compiled using CUDA-C version 5.0 and GCC 4.6.

MD Simulations
We performed MD simulations of the CG
model at constant volume and constant temperature, using a Langevin
thermostat. We fixed the simulation box size based on the NP concentration,
having one single NP in our volume (Figure 2c).

We kept a constant concentration
of proteins in solution, regardless of the number of proteins adsorbed
on the NP surface, adopting a method that mimics the experimental
buffer. Specifically, we divided the system in two regions: the inner
region, containing the NP with all the proteins concentrations fixed
to the experimental values, and the outer region, which is used as
a resevoir to control the concentration of proteins in the inner region.
The outer region is not considered for the calculation of the observable
quantities.

We compute the adsorption kinetics by counting the
number of adsorbed
proteins at every time-step. A protein is considered to be adsorbed
when the minimum surface-to-surface distance between the protein and
the NP is <0.5 times the specific protein’s radius.

Rescaling
of Numerical Time Scale to Real Time Scale
Our CG calculations
give us qualitative information about the kinetics,
and only after the comparison with the experiments, we can extract
the correct time scales and make our predictions quantitative. To
match the time scales of simulations, numerical NLDRE solutions and
experiments in, e.g., Figure 3, we fit the experimental results
with the NLDRE solution of eq S4 in SI,
assuming kFiboff ≃ 0 and adjusting the value of kFibon. This assumption is justified by the large affinity of Fib to the
NP. Furthermore, in eq S4 in SI also kHSAon and kHSAoff are free parameters. Because we verify that
the specific values of these two parameters do not affect the behavior
of the Fib fraction bound, we assume kHSAon = kFibon. This
procedure allows us to calculate the value of the Fib fraction bound
at early stages, not available from experiments, within the NLDRE
formalism with eq S3 in SI and match it
with our computational results. Therefore, on the one hand, we match
the NLDRE curve with the experimental fraction bound and, on the other
hand, the NLDRE curve with the computational fraction bound. In this
way we are able to calculate the scaling factor Ct (Table S1) in treal = Ct × tsim, where tsim is the simulation time and treal is the time in real units. We observe that
this procedure leads to the same scaling factor Ct for data in Figures 3 and 4.
