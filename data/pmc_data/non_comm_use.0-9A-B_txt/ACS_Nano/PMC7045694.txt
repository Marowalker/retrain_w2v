Biological nanopores
are emerging as powerful and low-cost sensors
for real-time analysis of biological samples. Proteins can be incorporated
inside the nanopore, and ligand binding to the protein adaptor yields
changes in nanopore conductance. In order to understand the origin
of these conductance changes and develop sensors for detecting metabolites,
we tested the signal originating from 13 different protein adaptors.
We found that the quality of the protein signal depended on both the
size and charge of the protein. The engineering of a dipole within
the surface of the adaptor reduced the current noise by slowing the
protein dynamics within the nanopore. Further, the charge of the ligand
and the induced conformational changes of the adaptor defined the
conductance changes upon metabolite binding, suggesting that the protein
resides in an electrokinetic minimum within the nanopore, the position
of which is altered by the ligand. These results represent an important
step toward understanding the dynamics of the electrophoretic trapping
of proteins inside nanopores and will allow developing next-generation
sensors for metabolome analysis.

==== Body
The metabolome
is the entirety
of all small molecules present in a biological system. These metabolites,
which include vitamins, sugars, amino acids, metal ions, and other
transmitter molecules,1 are involved in
many essential biological processes.2 Because
the metabolome is influenced by a variety of factors including gene
and protein expression,3,4 as well as lifestyle factors such
as diet, age, fitness, hormonal balance, and medication, the metabolome
displays the actual health status of an organism5,6 and
is directly related to diseases.7,8 It is also known that
many diseases alter the metabolite composition before developing clinical
symptoms.9 Therefore, the analysis of metabolites
in blood, also called blood metabolome, is a promising tool for early
stage diagnosis and continuous health-status monitoring. These specifics
are crucial for cancer diagnosis and therapy10 as well as for the evaluation of the progress of dementia11 or the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases.12,13

The diagnosis of diseases by monitoring the blood metabolome
requires
the targeted detection of hundreds of biomarkers to compare with standard
values.14 The detection of the concentration
of multiple biomarkers is important because the fluctuation on individual
values can be associated with multiple factors.15 Today, biomarker detection and analysis is performed utilizing
either mass spectrometry- or NMR-based methods.16 These techniques are reliable, the sample preparation is
kept to a minimum, and high-throughput approaches are possible.17 However, they require the use of large and complex
machines and trained personnel. Therefore, such analytical techniques
cannot be incorporated in home-diagnostic devices and are not amenable
for real-time analysis. Real-time detection of the blood metabolome
using wearable or implantable sensors would be beneficial, as it would
allow early and continuous background diagnostics. Indeed, an ideal
sensor for metabolite detection should be small, low-powered, selective,
and eligible to communicate with silicon-based devices.

Biological
nanopores are an emerging class of sensors with such
characteristics. A biological nanopore is a protein that forms a water-filled
channel on a voltage-clamped hydrophobic membrane. The output signal
is a current of hydrated ions passing through individual nanopores.
Crucially, nanopore currents can be easily digitized using small and
low-cost devices that contain thousands of individually addressing
elements. Most notably, portable devices containing nanopores are
now commercially available for DNA sequencing.18−22 Efforts are underway toward the detection and analysis
of peptides23−26 and proteins,27−35 as well as the detection of biologically relevant molecules such
as amino acids36−38 or sugars39 and even whole
viruses.40 The identification of metabolites
is complicated by the fact that blood contains thousands of chemically
similar molecules. Hence, real-time analysis of the blood metabolome
will require developing nanopores that contain a sensing element that
recognizes and quantifies a molecule with high specificity.

We have recently shown that folded proteins pushed by the electroosmotic
flow entered inside a cytolysin A (ClyA) nanopore. Notably, changes
in the nanopore current could report the switching of the protein
from its open unliganded conformation to its closed liganded conformation.41 The frequency of switching from the open to
the closed configurations is related to the concentration of the ligand
in solution. The single-molecule nature of the nanopore approach allowed
the simultaneous detection of multiple ligands.42 This is because when a protein enters inside the nanopore,
the associated blocked current can be used to identify the protein
adaptor. Importantly, the concentration of the ligand could be measured
directly from blood or other biological samples without any sample
preparation,42 indicating that this approach
can be used in real-time blood analysis.

Some of the protein
adaptors used in the initial experiments were
substrate-binding proteins,41,42 which are associated
with bacterial ATP-binding cassette importers for substrate uptake.43 Hundreds of such proteins exist that bind metabolites
specifically,44 which make them ideal in
developing nanopore sensors for metabolites. However, several aspects
of the nanoconfinement of the protein inside ClyA are unknown, including
the origin of the signal for the open and closed states, the relation
between the concentration of analytes in bulk and inside the nanopore,
the positioning of proteins inside the nanopore, and the relation
between the signal and the size and shape of the incorporated protein.
Here, we study 13 possible adaptor proteins varying in size, shape,
charge, and ligand. We found that the majority of proteins can be
used to determine the concentration of their cognate ligands in bulk
solution. The analysis of the protein blockades revealed that inside
the ClyA nanopore proteins occupy two possible binding sites depending
on the charge and size of the adaptor. Conveniently, the properties
of the protein adaptors can be manipulated to improve the nanopore
signal.

Results and Discussion
Protein Adaptors
Thirteen different
proteins were tested
as adaptors in the ClyA-AS from Salmonella typhi nanopore (Figure 1). These proteins were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified (Figure S1) before being
added to the nanopore. The protein sizes ranged from 25 to 42 kDa,
and their net charge from 0 to −12, while their cognate ligands
showed a variety of sizes, charges, and chemical properties (Table 1). In particular,
the ligand charges ranged from +2 to −1; their size from 88
Da (putrescine, or 1,4-diaminobutane) to 1355 Da (CN-cobalamin, Figure 1b). Eleven of the
13 proteins were substrate-binding proteins of ABC transporters, which
are known to specifically bind metabolites through conformational
changes involving large-scale domain motions.45−47 In order to
generalize our approach, as the shape- and the ligand-induced structural
rearrangement of SBDs are comparable, we also tested two proteins
from different families: nicotinamidase and hoefavidin. Nicotinamidase
converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, which are part of the vitamin
B3 system and are both metabolites and biomarkers.48 Hoefavidin is a dimeric avidin that binds specifically
biotin,49 which is also known as vitamin
B7.

a V represents
the electric potential applied to the trans side
of the nanopore. IRES is the residual
current after protein capture and was determined for the open and
closed levels depicted in Figure 3. KD is the apparent binding
constant, and σB/σO is the signal-to-noise
ratio of the protein adaptor. All experiments were performed in triplicates;
the error represents the standard deviation.

Protein Signal
In a typical experiment, a negative
potential is applied to the trans side of the nanopore,
whereas proteins are added to the cis side (Figure 2a,b). The entry of
the protein in the pore is observed by the specific reduction of the
open pore current IO to the blocked pore
current IB. In a 150 mM NaCl solution,
pH 7.5, each protein adaptor showed an individual current signal as
measured by the residual current IRES =
100 × IB/IO, the average residence time (τ), and the current noise (Figure 2). The latter is
quantified using σB/σO, which is
the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution of the protein
blockade (σB) divided by the standard deviation of
the Gaussian distribution of the open pore (σO).

signals in the ClyA-AS nanopore. (a) Typical trace showing
the main measurands of an adaptor protein in the pore: dwell time
(τprotein) and residual current (IRES = IB/IO × 100%). In a typical experiment, thousands of
dwell times are collected and exponential fits are used to determine
the average τprotein. IB and IO were determined by Gaussian fitting
to all-point histograms of protein blockades. (b) Representation of

histograms. (d) Protein signal optimization. On the left: Surface
representation of Pnc1p and Pnc1p_dipole (D82K, D83K, K216E, Δ6xHis)
with the arrow showing the direction of the protein dipole. The current
trace shows a typical protein blockade. The histograms were calculated
from a representative 10 s of protein block. All measurements were
performed in 15 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, under negative bias
(trans) and sampling at 10 kHz with a 2 kHz Bessel
filter. For figure preparation, all traces were additionally filtered
with a 500 Hz Gaussian filter.

Three classes of signals were recorded (Figure 2c). GGBP, SBD1, SBD2, MBP, and SpuD (see
the legend in Figure 1 for the full name of the proteins) showed a σB/σO of ∼1, or even <1 (Table 1), suggesting that such proteins are lodged
in a well-defined minimum within the nanopore where Brownian motions
are largely suppressed. Within this group, sometimes alternative blockades
with higher noise levels occurred (e.g., SpuD and
MBP; see also Figures S2 and S7 for longer
traces), which can be excluded from analysis. LBP, IbpA, TbpA, and
SiaP showed a more dynamic but reproducible current signal with a
σB/σO between 3 and 8, while Pnc1p
and BtuF exhibited a σB/σO above
10. Multiple levels were observed within a blockade, suggesting that
these proteins are either intrinsically dynamic or moving within the
lumen of ClyA on a time scale similar to the sampling rate (20 μs).
SpuE and hoefavidin represented a third kind of signal, in which each
blockade showed a different signal (IRES ranging from 44% to 57% for SpuE) and varying noise levels (Figure 2c). Since both proteins
have a large net negative charge (net charge −12, hoefavidin)
or are relatively large (39 kDa, net charge −8, SpuE), the
unfavorable signal might originate from a combination of electrostatic
and steric interactions with the nanopore inner surface.

In
order to understand the origin of the highly dynamic protein
blockades, we further investigated Pnc1p. Pnc1p has a net charge of
−9 that is evenly spread across the surface of the protein,
as shown by its net dipole perpendicular to the protein main axis
(Figure 2d; see also Figure S15 for dipole of all tested proteins).
If the dynamic current levels (σB/σO Pnc1p = 10) are reflecting the tumbling of the protein within the nanopore,
then the introduction of a dipole on the protein surface should reduce
the current noise. We introduced a negative charge at the C-terminus
(K216E) and two positive charges (D82K, D83K) at the opposite end
of the folded structure, and we deleted the C-terminal 6xHis-tag.
The σB/σO decreased from 10 to 1
(Figure 2d), and the
signal appeared uniform and clear, suggesting correct folding. The
noise reduction indicated that the highly dynamic signal was due to
the fast tumbling of the protein inside the nanopore.

Current Modulation
by Ligand Binding
In order to use
adaptor proteins as sensors, the addition of ligands to the cis side of the nanopore should induce a change in the current
signal. Nine of the tested proteins showed a change in the electrical
signal when the ligands were added in the solution. For some proteins
(SBD1, GGBP, SpuD, and TbpA, signal type 1a, Figures 3, S2, S3, S8, and S9), a single
well-defined additional level corresponding to the shift from the
open to the closed conformation of the protein was observed. Other
proteins (LBP, SiaP, MBP, and BtuF, signal type 2, Figures 3 and S4–S7) showed often a noisy signal already in the unliganded form; thus
the shift toward the closed conformation of the protein was more difficult
to assign due to the high noise. Probably, intrinsic motions and unspecific
interactions of the proteins with the nanopore are in this group more
pronounced. SBD2 was a special case (classified type 1b), as the current
blockade showed two well-defined current levels, and the addition
of the ligand introduced a third well-defined level. Previous work
demonstrated that the two levels of the apo protein
correspond to the different orientation of the protein in the open
configuration inside the nanopore, while the third level corresponds
to the closed protein conformation.41

Figure 3 Current
modulation of adaptor proteins upon ligand binding. In
each box the left trace shows the current blockade of the apo-protein; the right the blockade in the presence of the
cognate ligand added to the cis side. The ligand
concentration for each protein was SBD1, 470 nM asparagine; GGBP,
500 nM glucose; SBD2, 2.4 μM glutamine; SpuD, 64 nM putrescine;
BtuF, 500 nM CN-cobalamin; MBP, 2 μM maltose; LBP, 2 μM
leucine; SiaP, 400 nM sialic acid; Tbpa, 2 μM thiamine; SpuE,
1 mM spermidine; IbpA, 40 μM myo-inositol; hoefavidin, 10 μM
biotin; Pnc1p_wt, 2 mM nicotinamide; Pnc1p_dipole, 100 μM nicotinamide.
The blue line represents the unbound state; the red line the bound
state. All measurements were performed in 15 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.5, under a negative bias (trans). Traces were
sampled at 10 kHz and filtered with a 2 kHz Bessel filter. For figure
preparation, all traces were additionally filtered with a 100 Hz Gaussian
filter.

In all blockades the closed state
showed less current compared
to the open state. Since a more condensed structure is expected to
block less current than a less condensed structure, this finding suggests
that the signal is most likely associated with a change in the position
of the protein within the pore. Most likely, as the structure of the
protein becomes more compacted, the protein penetrates deeper inside
the nanopore, resulting in more current being blocked (i.e., less overall current). Interestingly, we also
noticed that all the apo protein showed conformational
transitions to the closed state also in the absence of their cognate
ligand. This could reflect spontaneous opening and closing of the
protein. Indeed, intrinsic conformational changes were observed for
GGBP58 and MBP59 as well as SBD1 and SBD2,46 in NMR and
single-molecule fluorescence studies, respectively. However, this
could also result from the binding of contaminant to the protein adaptors.

Hoefavidin, a dimeric avidin that binds to biotin, did not manifest
ligand-induced signal changes. Previous work using a tetrameric avidin
(60 kDa) revealed that the binding of biotin induced a conductance
change in the E. coli ClyA nanopore.60 Possibly, therefore, a tight fit between the protein and
the pore is required to observe the rather small conformational change
that follows the binding of biotin to avidin. Pnc1p and Pnc1p-dipole
also showed no change in signal upon binding to nicotinamide, as well
as two SBD proteins (Figure 3). These proteins have a comparable size and charge to other
proteins that display a ligand-induced signal (Table 1). Possibly, these proteins bind inside the
nanopore in a configuration that prevents the ligands from reaching
the active site or the conformational change upon ligand binding is
too small to cause significant current alteration.

Affinity of
Adaptor Proteins for Their Cognate Ligands
The ability of
the nanopore sensor to identify analytes was tested
by applying increasing concentration of ligands to the cis side of the nanopore and measuring the open and closed protein levels.
In GGBP, SBD1, SBD2, and SpuD the association kon and dissociation koff rate constants
could be measured by sampling the dwell time of the open (τon) and closed (τoff) levels (Figure S2b,c). Typically, more than 500 events
per condition were measured. kon were
then determined as 1/(τoncligand) and koff as 1/τoff. For this class of adaptors, the apparent binding constant KD was measured by increasing the ligand concentration
and observing the change in the binding frequency (Figure 4a). Conveniently, KD can be also estimated at a single substrate concentration
as koff/kon.

Figure 4 Dissociation constants and binding rates. (a) Representative example
of rate constant determination. Binding and unbinding frequencies
were determined from event dwell times (see also Figure S2bc). (b) Representative example of a ligand binding
curve. The percentage of protein in the closed state was determined
by the analysis of full-point histograms followed by ratio calculation
of the peak height of the bound and unbound protein state over concentration
(see also Figure S5bc). (c) Difference
between the KD determined in the nanopore
(KD pore) and the KD reported in the literature (KD bulk); see also Table 1. (d) Change in the percentage of SiaP in the closed state with increasing
negative potential at a fixed sialic acid concentration of 150 nM.
(e) Binding and unbinding rates for three different proteins with
increasing negative potential at a fixed ligand concentration (SBD2:
830 nM glutamine; GGBP: 50 nM glucose; SpuD: 8 nM putrescine). Kon and koff were
determined and then normalized to the highest value of every measurement.
All experiments were performed in triplicates. The error bars represent
the standard error of the mean.

For the other proteins, because their binding rates could not be
easily determined, the KD was measured
from full-point histograms of the whole trace (typically 2–3
min per concentration) based on the IRES (see Experimental Section). Within the histogram,
the peaks representing the open and ligand-bound (closed) protein
were easily identified (Figure S2d,e).
The KD was then measured by plotting the
fraction of the protein in the closed configuration (see Experimental Section) as a dependency of the ligand
concentration and fitting on a binding curve (Figure 4b). BtuF displayed a noisy signal that prevented
histogram analysis. However, KD could
still be determined by analyzing the fast-current blockades (see SI, Experimental Section, and Figure S6b,c).

The apparent KD values measured by
the nanopore were for six proteins comparable to the values measured
in bulk (Table 1, Figure 4c). GGBP and LBP
exhibited ∼4-fold higher affinity then determined in bulk measurements.
A notable exception was represented by the binding of sialic acid
to SiaP, which showed an 8-fold higher KD than in the bulk. A 100-fold decreased affinity compared to bulk
values was also observed for the binding of NADPH to DHFR61,62 and for the binding of oxoglutarate to AlkB.63 A possible explanation is that the diffusion of negatively
charged ligands across the nanopore is retarded by the negative bias
applied to the trans chamber. To test for this effect,
we measured the voltage dependency of the kon and koff rates for SiaP (net charge
of sialic acid −1), SBD2 and GGBP, which bind to glutamine
and glucose, respectively (both neutral), and SpuD, which binds to
putrescine (net charge +2) (Figure 4d,e). The signal of SiaP is complex and prevented measuring
association and dissociation rate constants. Instead, we determined
the fraction of the protein in the closed conformation as a function
of the bias. We found that the fraction of SiaP in the closed state
decreased with increasing potential (Figure 4d), which is compatible with an electrophoretic
reduced diffusion of the negative ligand across the nanopore. According
to this interpretation, when measuring neutral ligands (asparagine
and glucose), the dissociation and association rate constants remained
largely unaffected by the increased potential (Figure 4e). Unexpectedly, however, the binding frequency
of positively charged spermidine to SpuD decreased four times by increasing
the applied bias from −50 mV to −90 mV, while the dissociation
rate remained constant. This is surprising, because the diffusion
of putrescine toward the negative trans side is expected
to be facilitated by the applied potential. A possible explanation
is that SpuD, which is bigger than the other proteins tested (Table 1), sits tightly inside
the nanopore. The increased electroosmotic flow may push the protein
deeper inside the nanopore, thus reducing the accessibility of the
ligand for its binding site. Noticeably, however, at −80 mV
the KD of SpuD is similar to the value
measured in bulk (Figure 4c), suggesting that the effect of the potential does not significantly
compromise the integrity of the protein inside the nanopore.

Two Protein
Residence Sites inside the Nanopore
It
is generally accepted that in nanopore experiments the current blockade
arises from the excluded volume of the analyte inside the nanopore.64,65 Hence, for a protein inside ClyA, the residual current is expected
to depend on the size of the protein. However, the charge of the protein
and its relative position within the nanopore are also likely to play
a role. Two main forces drive proteins in and out the nanopore. Under
a negative applied potential, the electrophoretic force moves negatively
charged proteins toward the cis side, hence resisting
their entry inside the pore. By contrast, the electroosmotic flow
(EOF) moves the protein toward the trans side,66,67 facilitating the entry of proteins inside the nanopore independently
of the charge of the protein. The balance between these forces is,
therefore, likely to define the IRES and
dwell time of proteins inside ClyA. We found that for all proteins
the dwell time inside ClyA increased by about 10-fold every 10 mV
(Figure S16), indicating that despite the
charge of the protein, the EOF is the dominant force in driving the
proteins inside the nanopore.68,69 For five proteins (SBD1,
SBD2, BtuF, IbpA, and GGBP) we observed a decrease in dwell time with
the potential, suggesting that above a certain potential a protein
can translocate through the nanopore.62,70

The
voltage dependency of the proteins’ IRES showed two behaviors (Figure 5a). Noteworthy, SpuE and hoefavidin are not
included in the analysis because of the too large variation in their
signal. The IRES of Pnc1p, GGBP, LBP,
and MBP remained constant with the applied bias, while the IRES of the other proteins decreased when increasing
the potential. The former proteins have a relatively large negative
net charge (−9, −9, −9, and −6, respectively, Table 1), suggesting that
the trans to cis electrophoretic
force almost perfectly opposes the cis to trans electroosmotic flow. By contrast, the reduced IRES with the bias for the latter proteins most
likely represent a deeper penetration of the protein toward the narrower trans constriction of the nanopore as the EOF is increased.
Interestingly, the blockades of the highly negatively charged proteins
(LBP, MBP, and GGBP, but not Pnc1p) were associated with higher current
compared to the blockade of the other group of proteins (Figure 5b). It has been previously
shown that human thrombin (37 kDa, pI 8.8) occupies two residence
sites (R1 and R2) within the lumen of the ClyA nanopore depending
on the applied potential,71 where R1 reflects
a site located closer to the cis entrance of the
nanopore and R2 a more sterically constrained site deeper in the pore.72 Therefore, a possible explanation is that the
large and/or highly negatively charged proteins occupy the more superficial
R1 residence site, while smaller and less negatively charged proteins
occupy the deeper R2 residence site.

behavior in the nanopore.

three independent experiments. The threshold for classification as

Conclusions
The ability to sense
metabolites in real-time using low-cost sensing
devices is of great interest in personalized health-care monitoring.5,6 We recently showed that nanopores with internalized protein adaptors
can be used to quantify glucose and asparagine directly from biological
samples.42 Such adaptors belonged to the
SBD protein family, which comprises more than 120 proteins that are
capable of recognizing a variety of molecules including sugars, amino
acids such as Glu, Ile, Val, Met, Pro, Arg, Cys, His, and GABA, metals
such as tungsten, iron, and molybdenum, and vitamins such as riboflavin.44,73 In this work we investigated 13 different protein adaptors, which
bind to a wide range of metabolites (Figure 1). All proteins were tested under the same
condition of pH (7.5) and ionic strength (150 mM NaCl), so that multiple
protein adaptors could be used simultaneously under physiological
conditions.

Ligand binding was detected in nine of the 11 SBD
proteins examined
within the ClyA nanopore, suggesting that the majority of SBDs are
suitable adaptor proteins for metabolite sensing. Incidentally, the
adaptors were either negatively charged or neutral, while their size
comprised between 25 kDa (SBD1) and 42 kDa (MBP). Although a large
negative charge reduced the residence time of the protein inside the
nanopore, all proteins entered the nanopore and remained trapped for
several seconds. The analysis of the current signal revealed that
inside the nanopore proteins most likely occupy two residence sites
where they are in a relatively tight interaction with the nanopore
lumen. Noisy signals were occasionally observed, and they most likely
originated from the tumbling of the protein inside the nanopore with
a frequency comparable to the sampling frequency (10 kHz) or the intrinsic
motions of the protein itself. Nonetheless, the introduction of a
dipole within the surface of the protein allowed orienting the protein
with the electric field lines inside the nanopore and drastically
reduced the current noise.

The affinity binding constant measured
for the majority of the
internalized proteins that bound to noncharged ligands compared reasonably
well to bulk values, suggesting that the proteins remain folded inside
the nanopore and that the concentration of ligands across the nanopore
is comparable with bulk concentrations. It also suggests that the
electrostatic interactions between the proteins and the interior of
the nanopore, the relatively strong transmembrane electric fields,
and the confinement of solvent inside the nanopore do not fundamentally
change the function of proteins, which is rather surprising, as protein
folding is known to be affected by electric fields in solid-state
nanopores.64,78 Nonetheless, the small deviation
in affinity of the adaptors can be compensated for sensor application
by the usage of standard curves. The association rates measured for
charged ligands, however, depended on the applied potential, indicating
that the diffusion of charged molecules is affected by the electric
field drop inside the nanopore. This finding might be useful for a
sensor as well, because the applied potential can be used to tune
the affinity of the nanopore sensor for charged analytes.

Investigations
with solid-state nanopores revealed that, despite
the fact that the dipole and shape of the protein might be displayed
by ionic currents,74−77 the protein signal is originated almost exclusively by the excluded
volume of the protein.64,78,79 By contrast, by using biological nanopores such as ClyA, which has
a size similar to the size of the protein adaptor, we found that the
protein signal is also influenced by the position of the protein within
the nanopore, which in turn is determined by a complex relation between
the protein size, shape, surface charge distribution, and residence
site occupancy. This is advantageous since the binding of ligands
to the protein is likely to change the position of the protein within
the nanopore, which in turn is reflected by a change in the signal
that is used to detect the metabolite.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
enzymes from Thermo Scientific, and DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT).

Cloning
The genes encoding for the proteins used in
this work, which were designed to include NdeI and XhoI restriction
sites, were first digested and then ligated to either pT7SC, pET22b,
or pET101TOPO vectors. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli cells to amplify the DNA. The identity of the plasmid
was checked by sequencing. We used three different plasmids in this
study, all controlled by a T7 promoter. pT7SC: ClyA, GGBP; pET101TOPO:
TbpA, SiaP, LBP, SpuD, IbpA; pET22b: SpuE, BtuF, Pnc1p, hoefavidin,
MBP. The point mutations D82K,D83K,K216E introduced into Pnc1p and
the removal of the His-Tag on the C-terminus were done by a mega-primer
PCR80 followed by restriction with NdeI
and XhoI and ligation to the pET22b vector.

Expression and Purification
of ClyA Nanopores
ClyA
nanopores were expressed and purified as previously reported.42 In brief, the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in 2-YT medium. When the optical
density at 600 nm reached 0.6, 0.5 mM IPTG was added, the temperature
was set to 25 °C, and the cells were grown for 20 h. Cells were
then harvested by centrifugation (8000g, 5 min) and
lysed by three freeze–thaw cycles and resuspension in lysis
buffer containing 10 μg/mL lysozyme, 0.2 U/mL DNase, and 5 mM
MgCl2. After centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 30 min, the
supernatant resulted from a 100 mL culture was loaded on 100 μL
of Ni-NTA resin for purification utilizing the His-tag at the C-terminus
of the protein. Proteins were eluted with 300 mM imidazole in Tris
buffer (15 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and the protein was oligomerized
with 0.2% β-dodecylmaltoside (DDM) for 30 min at 37 °C.
Oligomers were separated from monomers using native polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. The band corresponding to the 12-mer of ClyA
was cut out, and the protein was extracted by adding 0.2% DDM and
10 mM EDTA in Tris buffer.

Expression and Purification of Adapter Proteins
Purified
SBD1 and SBD2 were kindly provided by Bert Poolman, University of
Groningen, and prepared as described before.41 Purified MBP was kindly provided by Giorgos Gouridis, KU Leuven.

His6MBP was expressed and purified as previously.47 Briefly, cells harboring the plasmid expressing
His6MBP was introduced to E. coli BL21(DE3)
cells and grown until an optical density (OD600) of 0.5
was reached, and protein expression was induced by 0.25 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The soluble material
(50 000 g, 30 min, 4 °C) was purified on a Ni2+-sepharose resin (equilibrated: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 M KCl, 10%
glycerol,10 mM imidazole; washed: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KCl,
10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole and subsequently with 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 30 mM imidazole; eluted: 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 300 mM imidazole), concentrated (Amicon,
Merck-Millipore), dialyzed (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 50% glycerol),
aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C.

For all other proteins,
plasmids containing the desired gene were
transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and a starter culture
in 2-YT medium was grown at 37 °C overnight. The starter was
transferred the next day in 100 mL of TB medium (or 2-YT medium for
GGBP and TbpA) to an optical density of 0.15 and grown at 37 °C
until OD ≥ 0.6. Expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM
IPTG, and cells were grown at 25 °C overnight. The next day,
cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000g, 5
min). All periplasmic substrate binding proteins (BtuF, GGBP, IbpA,
SiaP, TbpA, LBP) were prepared as follows: the pellet containing overexpressed
proteins was resuspended in 50 mL of ice-cold sucrose buffer (20%
sucrose, 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) per 100 mL of culture and
incubated with gentle shaking and cooling for 30 min. The suspension
was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended
in 30 mL of ice-cold water, shaken, and centrifuged as before. The
supernatant was taken for Ni-NTA purification. Hoefavidin and Pnc1p
were prepared by resuspending the pellet containing overexpressed
proteins in 10 mL of lysis buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 U/mL
Dnase I, 10 μg/mL lysozyme in protein buffer (150 mM NaCl, 15
mM Tris), pH 7.5), incubated 30 min at room temperature followed by
2 × 30 sweeps of sonication and 20 min of centrifugation at 7500
rpm.

All proteins except for hoefavidin were purified using
Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography. Typically the cell lysate containing the overexpressed
protein was loaded on ca. 500 μL in protein
buffer equilibrated Ni-NTA beads. The collected flow-through was loaded
again to achieve maximum loading. The beads were washed with 20 mL
of washing buffer (10 mM imidazole in protein buffer, pH 7.5). The
protein was eluted with 5 mL of elution buffer (300 mM imidazole in
protein buffer) in two steps and concentrated with Amicon centrifugal
filters to a final volume of 500 μL. Hoefavidin was purified
by affinity chromatography using 2-iminobiotin agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich).
The cell lysate was loaded twice on the beads using wash buffer (1
M NaCl, 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 11) followed by washing
with 20 mL of the same wash buffer. Elution was obtained with 5 mL
of elution buffer (50 mM NH4CH3CO2, pH 4). The protein was concentrated with Amicon centrifugal filters.
Buffer was changed to protein buffer (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris, pH
7.5) by diluting 1:100 in protein buffer and concentrating again by
using the Amicon filters. Protein concentrations were determined by
absorption measurement at 280 nm. Protein identity was confirmed by
SDS-PAGE analysis. Proteins were stored with 20% glycerol at −80
°C.

Electrical Recordings in Planar Lipid Bilayers
The
measuring setup consists of a vertical chamber containing two 500
μL compartments separated by a 20 μm PTFE film with a
central aperture of ∼100 μm diameter. A lipid bilayer
was formed on the aperture by adding a drop of hexadecane (2.5% (v/v)
in pentane) on each side of the PTFE film directly above the aperture.
After this, the compartments were filled with the recording buffer,
and two drops of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
was added on each side. An electric potential was applied to the trans side utilizing Ag/AgCl electrodes. By lowering and
raising the buffer level in one compartment across the aperture, a
lipid bilayer was formed within the aperture. After letting the bilayer
stabilize for 5 min, a pipet tip was dipped into the ClyA-AS solution
and dipped afterward into the buffer of the cis compartment.
The formation of single pores in the lipid bilayer was monitored by
applying a −35 mV bias, resulting in a current of −60
pA. Adaptor proteins and ligands were added to the cis compartment. All experiments were done in triplicates, which means
that three different single pores were used.

Electrophysiological Data
Recording and Processing
Electrophysiological data were recorded
under a negative potential,
which was varied between −20 and −150 mV by using an
Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) connected to
a DigiData 1440 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). The data were sampled
with a frequency of 10 kHz, and a low-pass Bessel filter of 2 kHz
was applied. After data recording, the traces were additionally filtered
with a Gaussian low-pass filter with a 100 Hz cutoff. Data recording
was executed using Clampex 10.7 software (Molecular Devices), and
analysis was realized with Clampfit 10.7 software (Molecular Devices).

Analysis of Current Traces
Open pore (IO) and protein block currents (IB) were determined from Gaussian fits to all-point histograms
using a bin width of 0.1 pA. IRES are
then calculated as 100 × (IB/IO). Standard deviations of the mean values of
Gaussian fits to all-point histograms of protein blockades (σ)
were calculated from 1 s traces using Clampfit (Molecular Devices).
The dwell times for proteins inside the nanopore were measured applying
a single-channel search function in Clampfit (Molecular Devices).
About 100 events at IB were collected,
binned, and fitted to a single exponential to determine the average
dwell time (τ). Single-channel search and dwell time analysis
were also used to determine the association and dissociation rate
constants for the ligands to their cognate protein adaptor. For that,
levels referring to the open and closed protein state were predefined
and picked by the program. Events with a duration of less than 10
ms were ignored. We collected at least 500 events per level per concentration.
Association and dissociation rates were then calculated as 1/τon and 1/τoff, respectively. kon = 1/(τoncligand) and koff = 1/τoff. KD were calculated for individual ligand concentrations
and used to measure the KD as koff/kon.

The KD for BtuF was measured by performing single-channel
searches (Clampfit, Molecular Devices) on individual current blockades.
Once the open and closed protein levels were identified, an analysis
was performed without excluding short events. We picked at least 1000
events. The relative time the protein spent on the closed configuration
was then estimated by counting events on the closed and open levels.
Although this analysis did not reveal the association and dissociation
rate constant, we could plot the fraction of the overall number of
events in the closed conformation versus the concentration
of the ligand to produce binding curves that could be fitted to a
binding isotherm (Prism5 software, GraphPad, one-site total fit) to
determine KD (Figure S6c).

KD can also be determined
by plotting
all-point histograms of full traces (2–3 min length) based
on the IRES using a bin width of 0.1 pA.
For that, IO was determined as described
above. All amplitude values within the histogram were divided by IO to finally plot the IRESversus the amount of data points. The
resulting peaks corresponding to the open (no ligand bound) and the
closed (ligand bound) protein conformation were then identified by
changing the ligand concentration in the cis chamber.
Typically one peak decreased (protein’s open form) and one
peak increased (protein’s closed form). We identified the IRES of the peak maxima of the open and the closed
state and determined the counts at this particular IRES for the open state (NO) and the closed state (NC) at different
ligand concentrations (added to the cis chamber).
Parts of the histogram that did not change with the concentration
of the ligands were excluded from histogram analysis (e.g., for SpuD, Figure S2). The amount of
closed protein in the sample was calculated by NC/(NC + NO) and was plotted against ligand concentration to fit a binding
isotherm and to calculate the respective KD. Full-point histograms corresponding to GGBP, SBD1, and SBD2 blockades
showed well-defined peaks corresponding to the open and closed states.
Hence, for these proteins a Gaussian fit was performed, and the area
under the curve was used to calculate the fraction of the protein
in the closed conformation.
