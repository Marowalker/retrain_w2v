The development of
an effective HIV vaccine continues to be a major
health challenge since, so far, only the RV144 trial has demonstrated
a modest clinical efficacy. Recently, the targeting of the 12 highly
conserved protease cleavage sites (PCS1–12) has been presented
as a strategy seeking to hamper the maturation and infectivity of
HIV. To pursue this line of research, and because peptide antigens
have low immunogenicity, we have included these peptides in engineered
nanoparticles, aiming at overcoming this limitation. More specifically,
we investigated whether the covalent attachment of a PCS peptide (PCS5)
to polysaccharide-based nanoparticles, and their coadministration
with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), improved the generated
immune response. To this end, PCS5 was first conjugated to two different
polysaccharides (chitosan and hyaluronic acid) through either a stable
or a cleavable bond and then associated with an oppositely charged
polymer (dextran sulfate and chitosan) and poly(I:C) to form the nanoparticles.
Nanoparticles associating PCS5 by ionic interactions were used in
this study as the control formulation. In vivo, all
nanosystems elicited high anti-PCS5 antibodies. Nanoparticles containing
PCS5 conjugated and poly(I:C) seemed to induce the strongest activation
of antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, T cell activation presented
different kinetics depending on the prototype. These findings show
that both the nanoparticle composition and the conjugation of the
HIV peptide antigen may play an important role in the generation of
humoral and cellular responses.

With almost
2 million newly
infected individuals per year, HIV continues to be one of the most
important global health challenges.1 Despite
the efforts dedicated to the discovery of an effective vaccine against
this virus, the most positive results achieved so far are those reported
in the RV144 vaccine (Phase III clinical trial), which conferred a
modest 30% protection against the infection.2 This protection was associated with the ability of the vaccine to
generate weakly neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses.3 It is also worth noting that the efficacy of
this trial declined from 60 to 30% from 42 to 60 months after administration,
which further underscores the need for HIV vaccine designs that would
efficiently induce protective and long-lasting immune responses. This
efficiency depends, to a great extent, on the adequate combination
of antigen and adjuvant.4,5

Considering how
the natural immunity to HIV-1 works, the peptide
sequences around the protease cleavage sites (PCS) have been proposed
as targets for a candidate vaccine against HIV. The protease is an
essential enzyme for the HIV virus because its function is to cleave
specific proteins, such as Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef, that are essential
for the maturation of HIV virions and, thus, crucial to its infectivity.6−8 The proteolysis of these proteins must take place on the 12 cleavage
sites in a controlled and sequential way, and the interruption of
this process, even in one single site, may interrupt virus maturation
and, therefore, stop virus infection.6,7,9 In addition, these sites are highly conserved among
HIV-1 viruses, which could help overcome the problems associated with
the HIV virus high-sequence diversity and rapid mutation rates.

A wide variety of nanosystems are currently under evaluation for
their ability to deliver vaccine immunogens to protect the antigens
from degradation and facilitate their internalization by the target
immune cells.10 In addition, it has been
reported that the response to antigen-loaded nanocarriers may be influenced
by their composition and physicochemical properties.10−12 Among these nanocarriers, chitosan (CS)-based nanosystems have been
widely employed as antigen carriers through both parenteral and mucosal
routes.13 In fact, CS is a biodegradable
and biocompatible polymer, with a FDA GRAS status, which has already
been approved for dietary use and as a wound-dressing material.14,15 Our group has originally reported the development of CS nanoparticles
(NPs)16 and nanocapsules (NCs)17 and assessed their potential to generate humoral
responses against different antigens, such as the recombinant hepatitis
B surface antigen (rHBsAg), the tetanus toxoid, and IutA antigen from E. coli.18−21 Other studies have also shown promising results when using CS-based
nanosystems in order to enhance T cell responses.22,23

A critical aspect that has not been completely elucidated
is the
influence of the antigen–nanocarrier interaction on the nature
of the immune response generated. In some studies, the association
of antigens to nanocarriers has relied on simple physical entrapment
techniques or the establishment of ionic or hydrophobic forces,24−26 whereas in others the association involved the chemical conjugation
of the antigens to the nanosystems.27−37 In the later studies, chemical conjugation was shown to increase
the humoral response when compared to other types of antigen association.31,32,36,37 More specifically, a study performed for a malaria antigen showed
that these improved humoral responses were caused by an increased
interaction of the antigen with the B-cell receptor when the antigen
was covalently attached to the surface of lipid NCs.32 Similarly, the covalent attachment of an HIV protein antigen
to virus-like particles resulted in an efficient generation of the
specific humoral and CD8+ T-cell responses.30

On the other hand, over the past decade
it has become evident that
the coencapsulation of antigens and adjuvants, such as the Toll-like
receptor (TLR) agonists, further improves the performance of antigen-loaded
nanosystems in vaccination.10 Furthermore,
it has been reported that these TLR molecules are able to direct the
immune response toward either humoral or cellular profiles.20,26,38

On the basis of this background
information, the primary objective
of this work was to evaluate if the chemical linkage of an SIV PCS
peptide antigen (PCS5) to polysaccharide NPs and the inclusion of
poly(I:C), could improve its immunogenicity over the association by
ionic forces to NPs. We hypothesized that the conjugation of the antigen
to the polysaccharides might prevent its release until the particles
are engulfed and processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby
dually improving and prolonging the induced immune responses. CS and
hyaluronic acid (HA) were the polysaccharides of choice to conjugate
the peptide antigen PCS5. In addition, the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C)
was included in these two nanosystems to stimulate a cellular response
against the antigen. As the control formulation, PCS5 was entrapped
by ionic forces in NPs of CS and dextran sulfate (DS), which were
previously reported as good antigen carriers for PCS peptide antigens.39 Polymer–PCS5 conjugates and the resulting
NPs were characterized in terms of their chemical composition and
structural organization. Finally, their capacity to activate the immune
system, regarding antibody production, T cell and APCs activation,
and generation of central and effector memory T cells in mice, was
studied.

Results and Discussion
Developing an effective HIV
vaccine has proved to be particularly
challenging due to the special characteristics of this virus. On the
one hand, the virus infects CD4+ T cells, which have an
important role in the development of the adaptive immune response.
On the other hand, it mutates rapidly, leading to a deleterious activation
of the immune system, which results in the generation of ineffective
humoral and cellular responses. In addition, the different virus strains
are highly variable, a fact that complicates the generation of broad
and protective immune responses.5 Our approach
for the design of an HIV vaccine has been to use the peptide sequences
that overlap the 12 HIV PCS as antigens. For the generation of infective
virions, these HIV PCS sites have to be cleaved sequentially; thus,
if a single proteolytic reaction is disrupted, the whole process could
fail. An additional advantage of the PCS peptide antigens relies on
the fact that these PCS are highly conserved regions among HIV-1 viruses,
and therefore, the mutation of the virus will not diminish the activity
of the vaccine.6−9 In a prior approach, these peptide antigens were entrapped into
CS/DS NPs and administered to nonhuman primates, which had already
been primed with the PCS1–12 encoding plasmids cloned into
viral vectors. The results showed a significant increase in the IgG
responses against PCS after nasal boosting with the nanoparticles.39

Based on these preliminary findings, we
sought to further improve
the immunogenicity of our PCS antigens by exploring different NPs-based
formulation strategies to deliver the peptide antigen. For this purpose,
the PCS5 antigen was selected for its association to the nanosystems,
based on the premise that one cleavage error could interrupt virus
maturation. PCS5 was first conjugated to two different polysaccharides,
CS and HA, and the resulting conjugate was used to form NPs by ionic
interaction with an oppositely charged polymer (CS–PCS5/DS
and CS/HA–PCS5 NPs). The TLR3 agonist, poly(I:C), was also
associated with these NPs in order to evaluate its effect on the cellular
immune response generated by the NPs. The already reported CS/DS NPs
with PCS5 physically entrapped were used as the control formulation.
These strategies were based on the hypothesis that conjugation of
PCS5 peptide antigen to the matrix-forming polymer would facilitate
the intracellular delivery of the antigen with the subsequent improvement
of the humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, poly(I:C)
was expected to boost the activation of APCs, effector and memory
T cells.

Development of Peptide-Loaded Polysaccharide NPs
Polysaccharides,
particularly CS, have attracted significant attention as biomaterials
for the design of antigen delivery carriers.13,40,41 Our group has originally reported the development
of NPs and NCs made of CS16,17 for the delivery of
a variety of antigens (e.g., tetanus toxoid, rHBsAg,
influenza, E. coli antigen, and also peptide antigens)
through different routes of administration.18,19,24,42,43 Other authors have also disclosed the utility of
nanosystems made of DS13,44−46 or HA,47−52 both negatively charged polysaccharides, to induce immune responses.
In most of these reports, the association of the antigen to the polymeric
nanocarrier was based on a simple entrapment process, normally driven
by ionic interactions between the polymers and the antigen. However,
in this work our objective was to covalently conjugate the PCS5 peptide
antigen to the NPs in order to achieve a more sustained and improved
presentation of the antigen to the immune cells.

Apart from
selecting the biomaterials to form the antigen nanocarriers, we also
chose an adjuvant, the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). This molecule mimics
viruses dsRNA and activates TLR3 inducing robust cytokine and chemokine
responses.43,53−55 With these
components, we designed three different nanosized systems, where the
antigenic peptide PCS5 was either (i) entrapped into the CS/DS NPs,
as the control formulation, (ii) covalently linked to CS, or (iii)
covalently linked to HA; prior to the formation of the NPs by adjusting
the ionic interaction of CS with DS or HA (Figure 1).

Preparation of CS/DS +
PCS5 NPs
Using the preparation
method for CS/DS NPs previously described by our laboratory,39 PCS5 was easily entrapped within CS/DS nanoparticles
by simply adjusting the ionic interaction of the cationic peptide
(PCS5) and the cationic polysaccharide (CS) with the negatively charged
polysaccharide (DS) (Figure 1A). The mass ratio 1:3 CS:DS resulted in adequate physicochemical
properties, association efficiency (80 ± 8%), and antigen loading
(8%). This apparent excess of DS was required to complex efficiently
the cationic peptide. The resulting NPs had a particle size of approximately
120 nm, a low polydispersity, and a negative ζ-potential (Table 1).

Preparation of CS–PCS5/DS/pIC NPs
PCS5 peptide
was conjugated to CS by an oxime bond, as schematically represented
in Figure 2Ai. 1H NMR analysis led to the identification of the signal peaks
of the aromatic rings and isopropyl groups of PCS5 (in blue), together
with specific signal peaks of CS’s glucosamine units (orange
arrows), which confirms the chemical conjugation of peptide and polymer.
The substitution degree, assessed using a colorimetric assay, was
of 2.6 mol of PCS5 per mol of CS (14% in weight).

characteristic signals (blue arrows) and the acetyl groups of HA (orange
arrows) in the conjugate. Key: CS, chitosan; PCS5, protease cleavage
site 5; HA, hyaluronic acid.

The CS–PCS5 conjugate was then used to form NPs through
ionic interaction with DS. In addition, poly(I:C) was also incorporated
into the NPs to increase its immunostimulatory properties. NPs with
adequate final antigen loading (5%), and poly(I:C) loading (0.3%)
could be obtained when the CS:DS (w/w) ratio was 2:1 (Figure 1B). The resulting NPs had a
particle size of 140 nm, with low polydispersity and positive surface
charge (Table 1). This
positive charge was attributed to a certain excess of CS conjugated
with the peptide, since increasing amounts of DS caused a decrease
in the surface charge (Supporting Information, Figure S1A).

Preparation of CS/HA–PCS5/pIC NPs
The conjugation
of PCS5 to HA was achieved through the formation of a thioether bond,
which has been reported to be cleaved in glutathione-rich environments,
such as the cytosol.56 In this case, thiol–maleimide
chemistry was employed to link PCS5 to HA (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The results of the 1H
NMR and DOSY analyses allowed us to evaluate the peptide conjugation
reaction and its yield. As shown in Figure 2Bii, the NMR spectrum of the conjugate exhibits
the characteristic peaks of PCS5 (blue arrows), and those corresponding
to the acetyl groups of HA (orange arrows). The substitution degree
calculated by NMR was of 3.8 mol of PCS5 per mol of HA (15.9% in weight).
On the other hand, DOSY analysis showed a diffusion coefficient for
the conjugate of 9.5 × 10–8 cm2/s,
similar to the one for HA (8.8 × 10–8 cm2/s) and much lower than the one observed for the free PCS5
(8.4 × 10–7 cm2/s) (Supporting Information, Figure S3), confirming the conjugation of the
peptide to the polymer.

Prior to the formation of the NPs using
the HA–PCS5 conjugate, a screening of blank CS/HA NPs was conducted
to select the most adequate polymer ratio combination (Supporting
Information, Figure S1B). A surface charge
switch from positive to negative values was observed when the mass
ratio CS:HA decreased. For this reason, a mass ratio CS/HA 1:1 was
selected to form these NPs, since their positive surface charge was
expected to allow the association of the negatively charged poly(I:C)
to the system (Figure 1C). The final NPs had a particle size of approximately 200 nm and
a positive surface charge of +30 mV (Table 1). Adequate loading values for PCS5 (5%)
and poly(I:C) (0.05%) were also achieved (Table 1).

Morphological Analysis of the Nanosystems
Field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images from the NPs were taken
for each nanosystem using the STEM and InLens detectors (Figure 3). In all cases,
a spherical particle shape could be observed, as well as diameters
similar to the ones reported by DLS analysis (Table 1).

Structural Distribution
of PCS5 in CS/HA–PCS5/pIC NPs
XPS analysis was also
used to characterize the surface composition
of this nanocarrier. The amount of sulfur present on CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs (1.15%) was higher than the one observed in blank CS/HA/pIC NPs
(0.28%), which indicates that PCS5 (2.05% of sulfur) must be present
on the external layers of the NPs (Supporting Information, Table S1). Similarly, the ratios C/O and C/N
determined for CS/HA–PCS5/pIC NPs (3.19 and 9.31, respectively)
were closer to those of PCS5 (3.50 and 3.66) than to those observed
in the blank CS/HA/pIC NPs (1.87 and 12.86), further confirming the
prevalent presence of PCS5 on the surface of the NPs.

On the
other hand, the binding energy of an element is very sensitive to
its chemical environment, and it can be used as the fingerprint of
a compound. Thus, we compared the required energy to extract one electron
from the carbon 1s orbital of PCS5, CS/HA/pIC, and CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs (Supporting Information, Figure S4).
The obtained profiles indicated that the binding energies of PCS5
alone and CS/HA–PCS5/pIC were very similar, as additional proof
that PCS5 was present on the surface of the NPs. This structural organization
could facilitate the presentation of the antigen to B cells, and increase
the humoral response against it, as already reported for similar antigen
presentations.32,34

PCS5 Release When Covalently
Attached to NPs
In the
present work, we also compared the influence of different covalent
attachments in the generation of the immune response. In this regard,
a noncleavable bond (oxime bond, in the CS–PCS5 conjugate)
and a cleavable one (thioether bond, in HA–PCS5 conjugate)
were evaluated. In the case of the CS–PCS5 conjugate (Figure 2Ai), the oxime bonds
have been reported as highly stable linkages at physiological pHs.57−59 Therefore, this linkage would be the model for a long-lasting attachment
of the peptide antigen, which would only be released after being processed
by APCs.

On the other hand, thioether bonds are known to undergo
retro-Michael reactions in the presence of free thiols,33,56,60 which are presented in great
amounts in the cytosol of cells as part of glutathione (GSH) molecules.
To demonstrate this hypothesis, NPs were incubated in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), alone or with a 10 mM GSH concentration for up to 8
h at 37 °C. As shown in Figure 4, almost no PCS5 was detected upon incubation in PBS,
however, upon incubation in a GSH-rich medium, PCS5 was immediately
released from the NPs. These results indicate that the release of
the peptide is triggered by GSH and led us to speculate that the peptide
will not be released in the extracellular medium, but only in the
intracellular compartments where high concentrations of GSH are present.61,62

Freeze-Drying Preserves
NP Properties and Allows Long-Term Storage
A key feature
of vaccine formulations is their stability during
storage. Thus, in order to improve the long-term stability of the
antigen-loaded NPs, the different formulations were freeze-dried using
different cryoprotectants. The results of the screening of the freeze-drying
conditions led to the selection of trehalose 7% for both CS/DS + PCS5
and CS/HA–PCS5/pIC NPs and 4% for the CS–PCS5/DS/pIC
NP formulation. These conditions guaranteed the preservation of the
original properties of the formulations (Figure 5). When stored at 4 °C, these freeze-dried
formulations maintained PDI and surface charge stable for at least
18 months, while particle size slightly increased.

In Vivo Antibody Responses
To evaluate
the in vivo activity of the different PCS5-loaded
prototypes, freeze-dried formulations were resuspended in water, and
50 μL of this suspension (containing a PCS5 dose of 5 μg)
was intramuscularly injected to BALB/c mice. A group of nonvaccinated
animals was used as control. Animals were vaccinated three times,
as shown in Figure 6A.

Figure 6B
shows
the evolution of the anti-PCS5 IgG levels over time. Overall, the
IgG responses elicited by the three different NP formulations increased
significantly over time, reaching their maximum values at the latest
time point in the experiment (week 16). At this time point, the amount
of anti-PCS5 antibodies detected in all NPs was three times higher
than the levels detected in unvaccinated mice. This increasing and
prolonged immunogenic response is of particular interest in the design
of an HIV vaccine because persistent levels of antibodies are essential
for an effective vaccination.63 This response
is also in agreement with previous data reported by our group that
showed the capacity of the antigen-loaded NPs to induce significant
IgG levels up to 28 or 37 weeks after immunization.20,25 Considering these previous results, it is possible that the antigen-loaded
NPs could still produce important levels of antibodies beyond the
16 weeks considered in our study.

In addition to eliciting a
strong and maintained immune response,
the results of this study also indicate that the covalent linkage
between the peptide and the NPs does not have an effect on the humoral
responses. This is in contrast with previous findings where antigen
conjugation improved humoral response when compared to simple ionic
interactions.31,32

In Vivo Cellular Activation
To evaluate
the changes in T cell subsets and the cellular activation of different
immune cells upon vaccination, splenocytes from naïve or NP-vaccinated
mice were stained and analyzed for different T cell and monocyte/macrophage
phenotyping markers. Multicolor flow cytometry gating strategy used
for phenotyping is summarized in the Supporting Information, Figure S5.

Monocytes and macrophages are
APCs that process and present pathogen-derived antigens to T cells.
Depending on their function, murine monocytes can be further divided
as Ly6chi and Ly6clow, with the former being
the classical pro-inflammatory and phagocytic monocytes and the latter
the nonclassical or patrolling monocytes.64−66 Thus, the greater
the activation of these APCs, the higher the capacity to recall other
cellular populations and to stimulate the immune system. Splenocytes
were stained with markers for phenotyping monocytes subsets Ly6chi and Ly6clow and markers for characterizing macrophages
(CD11b+ CD11c– F4/80+) to
identify the different subsets (Supporting Information, Figure S5A). To investigate if the nanosystems
were able to activate these subpopulations, the expression of the
costimulatory signals CD40+ and CD86+, both
involved in the T-cell activation process,67−69 was measured.
Regarding CD40+ expression, the highest activation of Ly6chi, Ly6clow, and macrophages by CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs took place 9 weeks post prime (Figure 7). However, this expression decreased slightly
during the subsequent weeks (Supporting Information, Figure S6). For CS/DS + PCS5 and CS–PCS5/DS/pIC NPs,
the number of monocytes and macrophages expressing CD40+ was lower than in the prototype containing HA, but the response
remained for a longer period of time. In the case of CD86+ monocytes and macrophages, the values mirrored the ones for CD40+, with the difference that at later time points the values
were similar to those found in naïve mice (Supporting Information, Figure S6). Overall, the prototypes of CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs and CS–PCS5/DS/pIC NPs elicited the highest stimulation
of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (Figure 7, and Supporting Information, Figure S6), which might be caused by the covalent
conjugation of the peptide antigen, in accordance with our hypothesis.
In addition, we cannot discard the potential role of poly(I:C) in
the stimulation process.70

In a second set of experiments and in order to
further assess the
activation of T cells, the secretion of two cytokines that influence
anti-HIV responses, i.e., interleukin 2 (IL-2) and
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα),71 was measured. IL-2 is involved in T-cell proliferation and expansion,72 while TNFα is a pro-inflammatory cytokine
that participates in innate and adaptive immune responses.73−75 We also aimed at evaluating the kinetics of T cell activation over
time, bearing in mind that an immediate high T cell response would
not necessary translate into the best protection. The results showed
that the three prototypes were able to activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with different cytokine secretion kinetics.
The highest overall secretion was observed for CS/DS + PCS5 NPs at
10 weeks. In the case of CS–PCS5/DS/pIC NPs, the highest secretion
of both IL-2 and TNFα was observed at 9 weeks and 16 weeks post
prime (Figure 8), whereas
in the case of CS/HA–PCS5/pIC NPs, this activation was more
sustained at 12–16 weeks (Figure 8). This pattern could be caused by the different
release profiles of the antigen from the NPs, as previously discussed.
It is also worth mentioning that delayed T cell activation observed
here has also been recently described for an mRNA-based vaccine,76 a result that raises questions regarding the
ideal T cell activation profile. The way this T cell activation profile
correlates with efficacy will be a matter of further investigation,
preferably in larger animal models.

acid.

Besides effector T cells, the
generation of memory T cells by vaccines
is also important to guarantee long-term responses against infections.77 Depending on the expression of the homing marker
L-selectin (CD62L), CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells
can be further divided as central memory T cells (TCM;
CD44+ CD62L+) and effector memory T cells (TEM; CD44+ CD62L–). Regarding their
role in the immune response, TCM are important for the
stimulation of dendritic cells and B cells and also because they help
expand the effector T cell subsets once they have encountered the
antigen. On the other hand, in the same situation, TEM rapidly
convert to effector cells to fight against the infection.78,79 Hence, our objective was to assess if the three nanoformulations
under study were able to increase both types of memory T cells, thereby
ensuring a good immune response upon infection. The results in Figure 9 indicate that the
three prototypes generated a modest number of memory T cells for up
to several weeks after the last boost. In general, the highest proportions
of memory T cells corresponded to CS/HA–PCS5/pIC NPs and CS/DS
+ PCS5 NPs, both at shorter and later time points.

effector memory T cells. The amount of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets expressing (A, C) CD44+ CD62L– (T effector memory – TEM) and (B,
D) CD44+ CD62L+ (T central memory – TCM)) was quantified by multicolor flow cytometry of splenocytes
from naïve (red bars) and NP-vaccinated mice: CS/DS + PCS5
(black bars), CS–PCS5/DS/pIC (white bars) or CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
(gray bars). Values represent mean ± SEM (n ≥
3). Statistical comparison between groups was done using a Mann–Whitney
test. Significant statistical differences are represented as * (p < 0.05) and ** (p < 0.01) for comparison
between groups. Key: NPs, nanoparticles; CS, chitosan; DS, dextran
sulfate; PCS5, protease cleavage site 5; pIC, poly(I:C) (polyinosinic:polycytidylic
acid); HA, hyaluronic acid.

Overall, the three prototypes of NPs showed the ability to
generate
important antibody responses (Figure 6B), whereas the ones containing PCS5 conjugated (CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs and CS–PCS5/DS/pIC NPs) activated APCs in a higher extent
(Figure 7). In terms
of cellular activation, all prototypes were able to increase the secretion
of important cytokines such as IL-2 and TNFα, although the production
kinetics varied depending on the prototype (Figure 8). The implications of these secretion patterns
in the protection against infection is a subject that has to be further
analyzed.

Conclusions
In the present study,
we engineered different polysaccharide-based
NPs loaded with an HIV peptide antigen candidate, PCS5. The results
showed that different factors, such as the attachment of the antigen
(ionic interactions and cleavable and noncleavable conjugations),
the presence of immunomodulatory molecules such as poly(I:C), or the
nature of the polysaccharides (CS, DS, or HA) could importantly influence
the type of the elicited immune response. All of the nanosystems showed
the ability to induced humoral responses against the antigen, while
for the kinetics of the effector T cell responses varied depending
on the prototype. In summary, composition, antigen attachment, and
adjuvants are important design aspects that need to be considered
when developing nanovaccines. Further in vivo studies
would be needed to evaluate whether these humoral and cellular responses
would translate into efficient protection in larger animal models.

Screening of Blank Nanoparticles
The preparation method
for all of the NPs in this study was ionic complexation, based on
the interactions between the oppositely charged polymers: CS and DS
or CS and HA.

For CS/DS NPs, mass ratios from 3:1 to 1:3 were
screened. Equal volumes (0.825 mL) of an aqueous solution of CS (concentration
from 1.875 to 0.625 mg/mL) and aqueous solution of DS (concentration
from 0.625 to 1.875 mg/mL) were mixed under mild magnetic stirring.
The solutions were kept under magnetic stirring for 10 min.

In the case of CS/HA NPs, mass ratios from 1.5:1 to 1:4 were screened.
Equal volumes (0.550 mL) of an aqueous solution of CS (concentrations
from 2.40 to 0.80 mg/mL) and aqueous solution of HA (concentration
from 1.60 to 3.20 mg/mL) were mixed under mild magnetic stirring.
The solution was stirred for an additional 10 min.

Synthesis of
CS/DS + PCS5 NPs
CS/DS NPs at a 1:3 mass
ratio were prepared as previously described39 but with materials of a higher quality grade. Briefly, 0.055 mL
of PCS5 in aqueous solution (4 mg/mL) was added to 0.770 mL of a CS
aqueous solution (0.67 mg/mL) under mild magnetic stirring. After
being stirred for 5 min, 0.825 mL of a DS aqueous solution (1.875
mg/mL) was also added. The solution was stirred for an additional
5 min, and the formulation was kept for 10 min without stirring prior
to characterization.

Determination of PCS5 Association Efficiency
CS/DS
+ PCS5 NPs were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using
CentriPure P10 gel filtration columns (emp Biotech GmbH, Germany).
The columns were first washed and stabilized with 15 mL of ultrapure
water, and then, 1 mL of NPs was transferred to the column and allowed
to enter the gel bed completely. After the void volume was discarded,
2 mL of ultrapure water were added to the column, and the isolated
NPs were collected. The association efficiency (AE) was calculated
by comparing the amount of PCS5 associated with the NPs with the initial
amount added to prepare the NPs (eq 1). For this purpose, isolated NPs from SEC were treated
to a final KCl concentration of 2 M to break the ionic interactions
between the components of the NPs. Samples were analyzed by ultra
performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) on an Acquity H-UPLC Class
system with a Tunable UV (TUV) detector (Waters Corporation, USA)
equipped with an Aeris 3.6 μm Widepore XB-C18 LC 100 ×
2.1 mm Column (Phenomenex, USA). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in ultrapure water and phase B of 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile HPLC gradient. The column
temperature was set at 30 °C, and the run from 10% to 100% of
phase B in 5 min. The amount of PCS5 in each sample was calculated
using a standard curve generated with known concentrations of the
peptide (6.5–100 μg/mL, r2 = 0.99). 1  

Preparation of CS–PCS5/DS/pIC NPs
The conjugate
CS–PCS5 was purchased from Pepscan. PAoa-Ahx-PCS5-OH was synthesized
using standard solid-phase peptide chemistry through Fmoc/tBu chemistry
and subsequently purified to specifications using reversed-phase preparative
HPLC.

On the other hand, CS was dissolved in buffer (10 mM phosphate
buffer at pH 6.5), while N-succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate
(S-4FB) was dissolved in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to generate
a stock of 30 mg/mL. A 50 μL portion of the S-4FB stock was
added dropwise to the CS solution (10 mg/mL in phosphate buffer),
and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight to allow for the coupling
of the S-4FB linker to the free amine residues in the CS. This derivatized
CS was then desalted using dialysis against phosphate buffer. Next,
a peptide aqueous solution at pH 6 was added to the activated CS solution
and allowed to conjugate overnight with agitation. The resulting conjugate
was then subjected to dialysis against phosphate buffer to remove
the unbound peptide.

The ratio of PCS5/CS was determined by
a colorimetric assay. First,
2-hydrazinopyridine was added to react with the S-4FB incorporated
to CS. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the chromophoric
bis-arylhydrazone obtained was quantified at 350 nm. The difference
between the amount of free linker before and after PCS5 conjugation
was considered the value of the substitution degree. CS, PCS5, and
CS–PCS5 samples were diluted in D2O water and analyzed
in a Varian Inova 750 spectrometer for 1H NMR, processed
using MestreNova (MESTRELAB).

For the preparation of these NPs,
a mass ratio 2:1 CS/DS was selected.
A 0.0385 mL portion of an aqueous solution of the modified CS (8.8
mg/mL) was added to a CS aqueous solution of 0.909 mg/mL to obtain
a solution containing 2 mg/mL of CS and 0.2 mg/mL of PCS5. Simultaneously,
2.5 μL of poly(I:C) (1 mg/mL) was then added to 0.250 mL of
an aqueous solution of DS (1 mg/mL), and this solution was poured
over 0.250 mL of the previous CS solution (2 mg/mL CS and 0.2 mg/mL
of PCS5) under magnetic stirring for 10 min.

Synthesis of CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs
The PCS5 peptide
was linked to HA by a thiol–maleimide conjugation reaction,
adapting a recently described protocol.80 First, HA was diluted in MES buffer (0.1 N, pH 6) to a concentration
of 2 mg/mL, and ASEM, NHS, and EDC in the same buffer solution were
added at a concentration 6-, 14-, and 143-fold times higher than HA,
respectively. The solution was kept under magnetic stirring for 4
h at room temperature and then dialyzed for 24 h to remove free reactives
(SnakeSkin, cellulose membrane MW 7 kDa, Thermo, Spain). In a second
step, 0.228 mL of PCS5 with a terminal cysteine residue in aqueous
solution (5 mg/mL) were poured over 5 mL of the solution of HA–ASEM
(1 mg/mL) in buffer (MES 0.1 N, NaCl 100 mM) under magnetic stirring.
The solution was kept under stirring for 4 h and then dialyzed for
24 h. Finally, the modified HA solution was frozen at −20 °C
and freeze-dried.

NMR analyses of HA, PCS5, and HA–PCS5
were conducted to characterize the link and determine the substitution
degree and the yield. For this purpose, freeze-dried samples were
resuspended in D2O and analyzed using a Varian Inova 750
spectrometer for 1H NMR and diffusion-ordered spectroscopy
(DOSY). Then the NMR spectra were processed using MestreNova (MESTRELAB).
The degree of substitution (DS) was calculated as the amount of PCS5
conjugated per amount of HA, while the yield was determined by comparing
the amount of PCS5 conjugated to the total amount added to the reaction
(eq 2). 2  

NPs were formed at a 1:1 CS/HA mass ratio.
Aqueous solutions of
either HA or HA–PCS5 at 2 mg/mL were prepared, and the ratio
between the two solutions adjusted to a final PCS5 peptide concentration
of 0.20 mg/mL. Poly(I:C) was also added as a 1 mg/mL aqueous solution
to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL. Later, 0.55 mL of this
HA and poly(I:C) solution (2 mg/mL, 2 μg/mL) were poured over
0.55 mL of a CS aqueous solution (2 mg/mL) under magnetic stirring
and kept stirring for 10 min.

Nanoparticle Characterization
The mean size and polydispersity
index (PDI) of the NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering
(DLS). The zeta potential values of the NPs were determined by Laser
Doppler Anemometry (LDA), measuring the mean electrophoretic mobility
after a 10-times dilution of the NPs in ultrapure water. Both properties
were measured using a Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Instruments, United
Kingdom). The measurements were performed at 25 °C with a detection
angle of 173°.

The PCS5 peptide loading capacity was determined
by calculating the real amount of PCS5 associated with the NPs (theoretical
mass × AE%) relative to the real mass of the formulation, represented
in eq 3. Poly(I:C) loading
values were calculated according to eq 4. 3   4  

Morphological Analysis
Morphological
analysis of the
suspension of NPs was conducted by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) (Zeiss Gemini Ultra Plus, Germany). NPs were diluted
1:100 in water and then with the same volume of phosphotungstic acid
(2% in water). A volume of 1 μL of sample was placed on a copper
grid with carbon films and allow to dry. Then the grids were washed
with water and analyzed under the microscope once dried. STEM and
immersion lens (InLens) detectors were used to observe the samples.

Nanoparticle Surface Analysis by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS)
The surface of CS/HA/pIC and CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs was analyzed to confirm the presence of PCS5. A droplet of each
NP suspension was placed on a silicon wafer, used as sample holder,
and then allowed to dry in a desiccator overnight. For the reference
materials (CS, HA, and PCS5), a small quantity of powder was pressed
onto a conductive double side adhesive tape on the standard sample
holder.

Samples were analyzed by angle-resolved XPS using the
ESCALAB 250 iXL instrument (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha ESCA, Thermo
Scientific, UK), and photoelectrons were collected from a takeoff
angle of 45◦ relative to the sample surface. Monochromatic
X-ray source Al Kα (1486.6 eV) was used for experiments and
spectra were acquired at 10–10 mbar. Surface elemental
composition was determined using the standard Scofield photoemission
cross section. The binding energies positions on unsputtered surfaces
were calibrated by setting the C1s photopeak corresponding to aliphatic
carbon at 285.0 eV. The atomic concentrations were determined from
the XPS peak areas using the Shirley background subtraction technique
and the Scofield sensitivity factors.

PCS5 Release in Glutathione-Rich
Media
CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
NPs were incubated at 37 °C up to 8 h in PBS with a 10 mM concentration
of reduced glutathione (GSH). In parallel, as a control, NPs were
incubated in PBS under the same conditions. At the different time-points,
NPs were centrifuged for 10 min at 16000 g to break the NPs and collect
the HA–PCS5 from the supernatant. Later, 1 N HCl was added
to the supernatant to lower the pH to 2, in order to avoid interactions
between the free peptide (pI 11) and the conjugate HA–PCS5
(pKa 3), and to prevent that any remaining
GSH kept reacting. Samples were analyzed by UPLC, as described for
PCS5, but with a run from 10% to 50% of phase B in 20 min. The amount
of free PCS5 peptide and conjugated PCS5 in each sample was calculated
using a standard curve generated with known concentrations of the
peptide and conjugate (6–50 μg/mL, r2 = 0.99).

Freeze-Drying
Nanoparticles were
frozen in the presence
of the cryoprotectant agent trehalose at −80 °C for at
least 2 h and then freeze-dried (Genesis 25 EL, S.P Industries, USA).
Lyophilization was done at a temperature ranging from −40 to
+20 °C, applying a progressive vacuum from 200 to 20 mTorr. After
this process, NPs were resuspended in water and their physicochemical
properties determined by DLS and LDA as previously described.

Animal
Care
Female BALB/c mice 6–8 weeks old
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA. USA)
and housed at the Veterinary Technical Service unit of National Microbiology
Laboratory (Winnipeg, Manitoba). A maximum of five animals were housed
per cage in a level 2 facility. All animals used in the project were
treated in a humane manner in accordance with the Principles of the
Canadian Council on Animal Care contained in the “Guide to
the Care and Use of Experimental Animals”. All animal procedures
were performed by highly trained personnel using approved techniques.
All mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 3–5% isofluorane,
and all possible efforts were made to minimize the pain and discomfort
of the animals. Euthanization of animals was conducted using an excess
amount of the anesthetic.

Murine Experiments
Eighty female
BALB/c mice were divided
into four categories. Five unvaccinated mice (week 0) were used as
a control. The rest of the mice were divided into three groups of
25 animals each. Mice were intramuscularly injected with 50 μL
of the resuspended freeze-dried NPs (CS/DS + PCS5, CS/HA–PCS5/pIC
and CS–PCS5/DS/pIC) at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. Each group of vaccinated
animals was kept in a separate cage and monitored every 24 h for feeding,
water drinking, and weight loss.

Plasma Antibody Quantification
Plasma was separated
from whole blood collected from mice using saphenous bleeding, by
centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min. Mouse plasma samples were collected
at 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16 weeks following vaccination, and
the concentrations of PCS5-specific plasma IgG antibodies were quantified
using a previously published protocol.39 Briefly, 20 μg of PCS5 was coupled to 1.25 × 106 Bio-Plex Pro Magnetic COOH Beads using a Bio-Plex Amine Coupling
Kit. 50 μL of plasma (1:80 diluted) were incubated with 2,500
beads. SIV-specific IgG was detected with phycoerythrin-labeled mouse
antimonkey IgG at 5 μg/mL. Bead fluorescence intensities were
acquired on the Bio-Plex 200 system and converted to concentrations
as previously described.39

Splenocytes
Response Quantification
Five mice per group
were sacrificed at 0 (naïve mice) 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16 weeks
(vaccinated mice), and their spleens were collected. Splenocytes were
purified by straining of spleens through a 40 μm nylon mesh.
The resulting mixtures were suspended in R10 media containing RPMI-1640
complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% antibiotic–antimycotic
solutions. The splenocytes were then frozen in freezing media consisting
of 95% FBS and 5% DMSO. Half a million splenocytes were transferred
into 12 × 75 mm polypropylene BD Falcon tubes for flow cytometry
antibody labeling. Alternatively, 5.0 × 105 splenocytes
were stimulated separately with a 5 μg/mL suspension of a pool
of PCS5 peptides: PCS5-1 (GPWGKKPRNFPMAQVHQGLM),
PCS5-2 (YGQMPRQTGGFFRPWSMGKE), or PCS5-3
(KPRNFPMAQVHQGLM) peptides. Peptide stimulated
and unstimulated splenocytes were washed using PBS with 2% FBS at
1500 rpm for 5 min. The washed splenocytes were surface stained with
either a T-cell or monocyte/macrophage cocktails of antibodies for
30 min in the dark and at room temperature. The stained cells were
washed using 5% PBS followed by addition of 150 μL of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm and
a 10 min incubation in the dark. Following the incubation, permeabilized
cells were washed using 1× BD Permwash solution followed by intracellular
cytokine staining (ICS) for 30 min in the dark. After ICS, cells were
washed using 1× BD PermWash and then run on LSRII flow cytometer.
Data acquisition was done using BD FACSDiva software and analyzed
using FlowJo (Treestar, Inc., USA).

Statistics
Data
analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Inc.). Comparison of group data was performed
with a Mann–Whitney test. Data was expressed as the mean ±
standard error of the mean (SEM). p values of 0.05
or less were considered statistically significant.
