Surface
phonon polaritons (SPhPs), the surface-bound electromagnetic
modes of a polar material resulting from the coupling of light with
optic phonons, offer immense technological opportunities for nanophotonics
in the infrared (IR) spectral region. However, once a particular material
is chosen, the SPhP characteristics are fixed by the spectral positions
of the optic phonon frequencies. Here, we provide a demonstration
of how the frequency of these optic phonons can be altered by employing
atomic-scale superlattices (SLs) of polar semiconductors using AlN/GaN
SLs as an example. Using second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy,
we show that the optic phonon frequencies of the SLs exhibit a strong
dependence on the layer thicknesses of the constituent materials.
Furthermore, new vibrational modes emerge that are confined to the
layers, while others are centered at the AlN/GaN interfaces. As the
IR dielectric function is governed by the optic phonon behavior in
polar materials, controlling the optic phonons provides a means to
induce and potentially design a dielectric function distinct from
the constituent materials and from the effective-medium approximation
of the SL. We show that atomic-scale AlN/GaN SLs instead have multiple
Reststrahlen bands featuring spectral regions that exhibit either
normal or extreme hyperbolic dispersion with both positive and negative
permittivities dispersing rapidly with frequency. Apart from the ability
to engineer the SPhP properties, SL structures may also lead to multifunctional
devices that combine the mechanical, electrical, thermal, or optoelectronic
functionality of the constituent layers. We propose that this effort
is another step toward realizing user-defined, actively tunable IR
optics and sources.

The mid-infrared
(MIR) to terahertz
(THz) spectral region offers great potential for technological advancement
using nanophotonics, which can impact numerous applications including
super-resolution imaging,1−4 enhanced spectroscopy,5 and narrow-band optical sources6 as well
as free-space signaling and communications.7 For instance, nanophotonic approaches are well suited for sensing
trace levels of chemical species through enhanced vibrational fingerprinting,8,9 owing to molecular vibrational frequencies in this spectral range.
One promising avenue for realizing these technologies is to use surface
phonon polaritons (SPhPs), which greatly enhance light-matter interactions
by confining light to subdiffractional dimensions at the surface of
a polar material.4,10−16 SPhPs are supported between the transverse (TO) and longitudinal
optic (LO) phonon frequencies of polar dielectrics, that is, within
the so-called Reststrahlen band, through the coupling of incident
light with the oscillating ionic charges on the polar lattice.12 One significant benefit of SPhPs is the substantially
reduced losses they exhibit in comparison to surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs). This is the result of the fast scattering of electrons in
metals and semiconductors compared to the much longer scattering times
associated with optic phonons.17 Since
the intrinsic losses of SPPs have limited their broad application
in many practical devices, low-loss SPhPs offer a highly attractive
alternative.12,18,19

One of the most important technological hurdles for the implementation
of SPhPs in nanophotonic and metamaterial technologies is that once
a polar material is chosen, the spectral characteristics of the SPhPs
it supports are fixed.20 While there are
many polar materials that occur in nature featuring Reststrahlen bands
that combine to cover the entire MIR to THz spectral domain,21 any given material will only support SPhPs within
its own relatively narrow specific band. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
an approach for broadening the spectral range of the SPhPs by using
atomic-scale superlattices (SLs) composed of commercially established
polar semiconductors. When materials are combined into SLs, the SL
vibrational modes are modified from that of the bulk phonons of the
constituent materials by interfacial chemical bonding, electrostatic
effects, and changes to the material lattice constants.22,23 Confinement effects can arise, resulting in confined phonon modes
that oscillate predominantly in one material,22 or new vibrational states can occur that feature phonons redistributed
over both materials. Interface phonon modes may also be supported,
wherein the vibration is localized to the interfaces between the constituent
materials.24 In addition, significant strain
can develop in such atomic-scale SLs, resulting in controllable spectral
shifts in the phonon frequencies. As the SL layer thickness is reduced
down to a length scale approaching a few monolayers, chemical bonding
between the interfacial layers plays an increasingly prominent role
in determining the phonon modes in the SL. These phonon modes, in
turn, have a direct impact on the SL dielectric function. We refer
to such atomic-scale SL structures where the IR dielectric function
diverges from its constituents as a crystalline hybrid (XH)20,25 since it is these changes to the chemical structure of the crystal
lattice that modify the IR response.

We demonstrate the XH approach
by using atomic-scale AlN/GaN SLs,
which exhibit a highly anisotropic IR response featuring multiple
Reststrahlen bands. Using second harmonic generation (SHG) phonon
spectroscopy, we probe the SL phonon modes and identify multiple confined
phonons. We further show that the phonon modes, which define the upper
and lower limits of the Reststrahlen bands, shift by >10 cm–1 depending on the SL layer thicknesses. By extracting
the SL dielectric
function via IR ellipsometry, we further illustrate that the SL has
spectral regions that support surface-confined SPhPs as well as volume-confined
hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs). In spectral ranges where hyperbolicity
is present, the spectral dispersion in both the negative and positive
permittivity directions is quite strong, in stark contrast to typical
natural hyperbolic materials11,13,26 and hyperbolic metamaterials.27 Our results
are corroborated by density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT)
calculations of the SL vibrational patterns, which show the characteristics
of confined and interface modes as well as those of hybrid modes that
do not resemble any established profile in macroscopic theory. The
XH approach therefore provides the opportunity to modify the optic
phonon frequencies, the dielectric function and dispersion of the
optical constants, as well as the width of the Reststrahlen bands.
Therefore, with more extensive investigations into the XH design principles,
we envision the ability to create engineered materials for IR and
THz nanophotonics and optoelectronics, incorporating additional functionalities
through appropriate material selection.

Results and Discussion
To demonstrate the XH concept, multiple AlN/GaN SL samples, each
with layer thicknesses of ∼10 or fewer monolayers, were grown
along the wurtzite c-axis using molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE). A representative schematic of the layered sample configuration
is provided in Figure 1a for an AlN/GaN SL grown on a SiC semi-insulating substrate. Wurtzite
GaN and AlN are both birefringent with A1(TO) and A1(LO) phonon modes that oscillate parallel to the crystal c-axis and E1(TO) and E1(LO) phonon
modes that oscillate perpendicular to the c-axis.
For GaN (AlN), these bulk phonon frequencies28,29 are A1(TO) = 533 (614) cm–1, A1(LO) = 735 (893) cm–1, E1(TO)
= 561 (673) cm–1, and E1(LO) = 743 (916)
cm–1. In bulk form, AlN and GaN have a similar IR
response, with partially overlapping Reststrahlen bands bound by their
respective optic phonon frequencies. This is shown in Figure 1b, which plots the calculated
reflectance of bulk GaN (blue), AlN (orange), and SiC (red).

respectively. The AlN layers appear as dark-gray bands, and the GaN
layers as light-gray bands. (d, f) Measured reflectance spectra (blue

Two representative SL structures, referred to as Samples
‘A’
and ‘B’, are discussed here. Sample A, shown in the
cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image
in Figure 1c, consists
of 50 alternating layers of AlN and GaN grown on a ∼50 nm thick
AlN buffer layer. Since this sample was deliberately not rotated during
growth, a gradient in the Al- and Ga-flux across the wafer surface
resulted in a strong variation in the corresponding layer thicknesses,
with values ranging from 2 to 3 nm for the AlN and GaN layers depending
on the position on the sample. At the particular location displayed
in Figure 1c, each
layer is ∼2 nm thick. Sample B (STEM image in Figure 1e) consists of a SL with 500
atomically thin, alternating layers of AlN and GaN with thicknesses
of ∼1.2 nm (∼4 monolayers) and ∼1.4 nm (∼5
monolayers), respectively. The layer thicknesses in Sample B are much
more uniform across the sample surface, which result from the sample
rotation performed during growth. The STEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements imply chemical intermixing at the interfaces, and that
the SLs are partially relaxed, but with an overall high degree of
chemical segregation (see Sec. S3 in the Supporting Information).

The optic phonon modes of SLs consisting
of polar materials30 including III-nitride
materials systems31−36 have been extensively studied and generally described using both
microscopic and macroscopic models.24 For
sufficiently thick layers, it is accepted that the effect of the phonon
modes on the SL IR response can be described using macroscopic electromagnetic
modeling, for example, the transfer-matrix method, starting from the
bulk permittivity of each layer.37 A particularly
simple macroscopic approximation that applies when the SL layers are
much thinner than the wavelength of the light within the materials
is the well-known effective-medium theory. However, as the layer thicknesses
in the SL are reduced to just a few atomic layers, the SL phonon modes
are no longer well described by such macroscopic models. This is because
atomic-scale interactions modify the SL phonon modes, namely, the
prominent effects of the interface bonds impose different boundary
conditions, and the lattice constants of the epitaxially grown layers
deviate from bulk values. This point is illustrated in Figure 1d and f, where the measured
IR reflectance (blue line) is plotted for Samples A and B, respectively,
along with the calculated reflectance (orange dotted line) of the
SLs using the transfer-matrix method based on the bulk optical constants
of AlN and GaN. It is clear that the conventional approach toward
predicting the IR reflectance fails, due to the strong quantitative
mismatch of peak positions and the emergence of additional spectral
features in the experimental spectra. It is even less accurate for
Sample B that features thinner layers and hence exhibits more prominent
interface and confinement effects.

In an effort to quantify
the impact of the SL design, we first
characterize the SL optic phonons, which define the poles and zeros
of the IR dielectric function, and the spectral extent of the Reststrahlen
bands. Quantitative analysis of the phonon modes from FTIR spectra
is difficult due to the highly reflective nature of the Reststrahlen
band of the SiC substrate, along with the high reflectance of the
developing XH Reststrahlen bands located between the multiple LO/TO
phonon pairs. Thus, we employed IR SHG,38−42 collecting spectra from the AlN/GaN SL using the
IR emission from a free-electron laser.43 This technique was recently shown to provide clear identification
of phonon modes in multimode systems44 since
it allows the direct measurement of phonon peaks on a nominally flat
spectral background.

IR SHG and reflectance spectra were collected
from three locations
on Sample A with varying AlN and GaN layer thicknesses and are shown
in Figure 2a and b,
respectively. Within the SHG spectra, each E1(TO) phonon
is observed with large contrast.44 Additionally,
A1(LO) phonons of the SL can be closely approximated via
the Berreman effect,45 which produces subtle
dips in the reflectance near the spectral position where the real
part of the permittivity crosses through zero (the so-called epsilon-near-zero
condition). The strong confinement of the electromagnetic fields of
the Berreman modes46,47 also results in pronounced peaks
in the SHG spectra.48 In addition to the
phonon resonances of the SL, those corresponding to the SiC substrate
and AlN buffer layer are also present in the spectra (Figure 2a). However, these two sets
of modes are easily identified, as they occur at the bulk TO and LO
phonon frequencies of these materials and do not vary spectrally with
the changing layer thicknesses at different positions on the wafer
surface. The SHG peaks originating from the SiC, the AlN buffer, and
the SL are highlighted in blue, orange, and green, respectively, in Figure 2. From these measurements,
the thickness-dependent spectral dispersion of the SL IR modes can
be identified.

A.

with graded AlN and GaN layer thicknesses. Subscripts in the legend
denote the average number of monolayers. SHG peaks marking the SL’s
optic phonon modes shift spectrally with varying layer thicknesses,
thus demonstrating the ability to design the XH modes (green shade).
In contrast, SHG peaks at AlN and SiC bulk phonon frequencies (orange
and blue shade, respectively) originating from the buffer layer and
the substrate, respectively, do not shift as the SL’s layer
thicknesses vary. (b) Corresponding reflectance spectra. The layer-thickness-dependent
behavior of the XH optic phonons in the linear response is consistent
with the features observed in the SHG spectra. Please note the logarithmic
scale in panel a.

The modification of the
phonons in the XH can be quantified through
line shape analysis of the SHG spectra. The SL is observed to support
two E1(TO)-like phonon modes around ∼575 cm–1 and ∼630 cm–1 as well as
three A1(LO)-like phonons: one at ∼735 cm–1 and two more at ∼840 and 880 cm–1. From
the SHG spectra, it is clear that the spectral positions of the SL
optic phonons vary strongly across the wafer (see Sec. S4 and Figure
S4 in the Supporting Information for the
full data set and extended discussion). We observe significant frequency
shifts (>10 cm–1) of these modes even for small,
angstrom-scale changes in the layer thicknesses. One possible explanation
for such strong sensitivity of the phonon frequency to the layer thickness
is the potential variation in lattice strain across the wafer. Lattice
strain has been shown to produce shifts in the phonon frequencies
in AlN/GaN SLs.31,49 The lattice mismatch between
AlN (in-plane lattice constant a = 3.112 Å)
and GaN (a = 3.189 Å) is ∼2.5%; therefore,
we expect a significant modification of the lattice constants of the
SL, with the in-plane values falling between those of AlN and GaN.
This results in tensile and compressive strain for the AlN and GaN
layers, respectively. In this case, the effective in-plane lattice
constant in the structure should strongly depend upon the thickness
ratio between the two materials. We used high-resolution XRD reciprocal
space mapping (RSM) to measure the in-plane lattice constants of the
constituent layers and determine the in-plane strain. The in-plane
lattice constant was measured to be 3.152 Å, 3.157 Å, and
3.168 Å for the sample positions corresponding to the red, orange,
and blue curves in Figure 2, respectively. In Table 1, we report the in-plane strain εxxRSM for the AlN and GaN layers with these lattice constants relative
to the corresponding bulk in-plane lattice parameters (3.112 and 3.189
Å, respectively). The biaxial strain in the GaN (AlN) layers
varies from −0.7 to −1.2% (1.3 to 1.8%).

a εxxRSM is the in-plane strain
determined by X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping. σxx and εxxSHG are the biaxial stress
and in-plane strain estimated from the frequency shift of the E1(TO) phonon modes in Figure 2. Error of the last digit is denoted in the parentheses.

To determine if the observed
phonon shifts can be the result of
the measured lattice strain in the SLs, we estimated the in-plane
lattice strain necessary to cause the observed phonon spectral shifts
in Figure 2. The E1(TO)-like phonon frequencies around ∼575 cm–1 and ∼630 cm–1 in Figure 2 are similar to the corresponding frequencies
of bulk GaN (∼561 cm–1) and AlN (∼673
cm–1), respectively. In addition, the A1(LO)-like phonons at ∼735 and 880 cm–1 are
close in frequency to the A1(LO) frequencies of bulk GaN
(∼735 cm–1) and AlN (∼900 cm–1), respectively. This suggests that these SL phonon modes correspond
to GaN-like and AlN-like E1(TO) and A1(LO) modes
that are spectrally shifted due to strain. We calculated the biaxial
stress σxx in the AlN and GaN layers
using the shift of the E1(TO) phonon frequencies relative
to the bulk values in unstrained GaN and AlN and the pressure coefficients
for GaN and AlN.50,51 The results are summarized in Table 1. We also calculated
the in-plane strain εxxSHG for the GaN and AlN layers using
the following equation: 1  where Cij represents the elastic constants for GaN or AlN.29,31,52 The strain necessary to generate
the observed spectral shifts is consistent with the strain measured
using RSM. Therefore, controlling the AlN/GaN layer thicknesses provides
a direct means to tune the phonon frequencies through lattice strain,
which depends on the thickness ratio between AlN and GaN. In addition
to strain, the layer thicknesses can potentially influence the phonon
frequencies through interface bonding and abruptness, bond lengths
with the layers, and phonon confinement. Understanding the impact
of these variables on the phonon frequencies and corresponding influence
upon the IR dielectric function of XH materials will be the focus
of subsequent work.

It is apparent from the presence of additional
phonon modes and
larger spectral shifts in the phonon spectrum of the atomic-scale
SL in Sample B (Figure 1f) that a description of the modified dielectric function using only
strain-induced shifts of the bulk optic phonon modes is incomplete.
As the SLs are reduced to just a few atomic layers, the effects of
the modified chemical bonding at the interfaces become more prominent.
To identify the origin of these new SL-specific phonon modes, we turn
to DFPT,23 which provides a direct and
powerful means of incorporating the atomistic details (i.e., the effects
of the interface bonds and modified lattice constants) on the XH phonon
modes. We employ DFPT to calculate the phonon modes of Sample B with
the assumption that it has five monolayers of GaN and four monolayers
of AlN in each period (close to the measured layer thicknesses from
the cross-sectional TEM analysis) as well as fully relaxed lattice
constants. A full list of the resultant phonon modes is presented
in Table S3 of the Supporting Information.

To compare the DFPT calculation with the IR response of Sample
B, we extracted the XH dielectric function from IR ellipsometric spectra.
For these XH structures, where the layer thicknesses are only a few
monolayers, interfacial bonding plays a significant role in shaping
the phonon density of states. To account for this effect, we treat
the XH structure as a whole and derive a dielectric function for the
entire layer. The AlN/GaN XH is strongly birefringent, with very different
in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, denoted ε⊥ and ε∥, respectively. The
dielectric function for a polar semiconductor with k phonon modes is given by 2  where j = ∥ or ⊥
for the permittivity parallel or perpendicular to the c-axis.53 The parameter ϵ∞ is the high frequency dielectric constant, and ωLO and ωTO are the LO and TO phonon frequencies, with
a damping parameter of γ. The ωTO,∥ and
ωLO,∥ phonon modes with A1 symmetry
oscillate parallel to the c-axis, while the ωTO,⊥ and ωLO,⊥ phonons with
E1 symmetry oscillate perpendicular to the c-axis. We extracted the dielectric function of the SL from Sample
B (Figure 3a,b) through
least-squares fitting of IR ellipsometry data, using eq 2 as the fitting function and the
WVASE program from J.A. Woollam.54 However,
as spectroscopic ellipsometry is insensitive to the A1(TO)
mode for a basal-plane oriented uniaxial crystal,35,49 the frequencies of the A1(TO) mode was determined separately
using confocal Raman spectroscopy and fixed as 552 cm–1 in the ellipsometric fit. We also used eq 2 to calculate the dielectric function using
the DFPT-derived phonon modes (Figure 3c,d). For this dielectric function, the damping parameter
was empirically chosen to be 10 cm–1 for all phonon
modes. For comparison, the effective-medium calculations of the XH
dielectric function using the optical constants for bulk GaN and AlN
measured by ellipsometry are also provided (Figure 3e,f). The effective-medium calculation is
based on the average of the GaN and AlN dielectric functions weighted
by the relative thickness of the layers. It is clear that the effective-medium
calculation fails to predict several important features of the IR
response because it does not account for the atomic-scale interactions
between the layers. On the other hand, good qualitative agreement
with experiment is found with the DFPT-derived dielectric function.
The small frequency shifts of the modes between the DFPT and experiment
are typical and can be attributed to the choice of the exchange-correlation
functional. The DFPT calculation accurately predicts multiple short-wavelength
phonon modes for the out-of-plane permittivity induced by the reduced
crystal symmetry of the SL. It can also provide physical insight into
the qualitative vibrational character of the modes. Thus, the atomic-scale
SL should be considered as a XH material, with a distinct dielectric
function dictated by the atomic-scale interactions within the SL.

cm–1 and 615–784 cm–1 Reststrahlen
bands, respectively, for ε⊥ shown in panel
c. Blue, orange, and gray spheres denote Ga, Al, and N, respectively,
and red arrows denote atomic displacement.

From the extracted XH dielectric function, it is found that
Sample
B exhibits multiple Reststrahlen bands (identified by regions with
Re(ε) < 0) as a result of the induced and shifted optic phonon
modes. The poles in the dielectric function occur at E1(TO)-like and A1(TO)-like phonon frequencies and the zero
crossings near E1(LO)-like and A1(LO)-like phonon
frequencies for ε⊥ and ε∥, respectively. The in-plane dielectric function ε⊥ displays two Reststrahlen bands: one narrow region from 572 to 599
cm–1 and another from 629 to 807 cm–1. Similar Reststrahlen bands occur in the dielectric function derived
from the DFPT calculations (Figure 3c), but with a ∼15 cm–1 redshift.
The calculated phonon vibrational pattern associated with the 559–583
cm–1 Reststrahlen band (Figure 3g) illustrates that it most closely resembles
a GaN-confined mode. In contrast, the vibrational characters associated
with the phonons occurring at the phonon frequencies of the 615–784
cm–1 Reststrahlen band (Figure 3h) are confined predominantly within the
AlN layers but are centered at the AlN/GaN interface. Importantly,
the in-plane Reststrahlen bands of the XH cover a broader range than
that of GaN (∼561–743 cm–1) and are
on the same scale as AlN (∼673–916 cm–1). To our knowledge, the only other way to achieve such broadening
of the Reststrahlen band is through the inclusion of high densities
of free carriers, for example, via doping.55 However, this approach introduces substantial increases in loss
due to the inclusion of free-carrier scattering, dopant scattering
of optic phonons, and the increased Drude weight within the dielectric
function. To put this in context, we estimate that shift of the Reststrahlen
band of GaN out to 800 cm–1 via free carriers would
require a carrier density of ∼3 × 1018 cm–3 and would increase Im(ε) by about six-fold
at 800 cm–1. In contrast, even within the nonoptimized
XH structures discussed here with multiple interfaces and significant
strain increased Im(ε) by about a factor of 3.

The out-of-plane
dielectric function ε∥ is dominated by a broad
Reststrahlen band extending from ∼536
cm–1 to ∼740 cm–1. Examination
of the corresponding vibrational pattern from the DFPT calculation
(Figure S10) shows that the phonon mode
includes the displacement of nitrogen atoms in both layers. While
the nitrogen atomic displacement is larger in the GaN layers, the
phonon vibration exhibits an extended character. Two additional Reststrahlen
bands are observed within ε∥, with one extending
from 769 to 791 cm–1 and the other from 828 to 859
cm–1. Examination of the lattice vibrational patterns
indicates that these modes involve atomic movement in both layers,
but a larger amplitude in the AlN due to its lighter reduced mass.
The energy scale of the optic phonons is mostly driven by the lighter
of the two atomic species in a diatomic lattice (here, nitrogen).12 The small difference in the reduced masses of
GaN (∼11 amu) and AlN (∼9 amu) results in a spectral
overlap of the respective Reststrahlen bands and the limited degree
of confinement of the SL phonon modes observed in these structures.

The strongly anisotropic Reststrahlen bands of the XH result in
both elliptical (the same sign of ε⊥ and ε∥) and hyperbolic (opposite signs) behaviors within
the long-wave IR.27 However, unlike most
hyperbolic systems studied to date, the vibrational resonances of
the XH and the strong spectral dispersion result in a wide spectral
range over which both the positive and negative permittivities vary
rapidly with frequency. In the Supporting Information (Figure S7), we plot the birefringence, Δn = ne – no, of Sample B, which is in
excess of unity over a large portion of the spectral range. Because
of the rapidly changing dispersion, Δn reaches
a maximum of ∼10 at 527 cm–1 but then drops
to ∼−8 at 566 cm–1. Such extreme birefringence
is about an order of magnitude larger than the recently reported materials
of BaTiS3 and MoO3,26,56,57 which exhibit birefringence values of about
0.76 and 0.31, respectively. This highlights an important opportunity
to engineer hyperbolic spectral behavior through careful selection
of the SL polar semiconductor constituents, thicknesses, and epitaxial
mismatch.

One challenge associated with using atomic-scale SL
designs to
modify the IR dielectric function is to ensure the optical loss is
not substantially increased. The loss can be quantified by comparing
the damping parameter, γ, of the different modes of the XH to
the bulk constituents, GaN and AlN. The damping parameters were extracted
from the dielectric function fits for each of the XH phonon modes
and are listed in Table S2 in the Supporting Information, with the values falling within the 10–25 cm–1 range. For comparison with the XH, we also grew films of bulk GaN
and AlN and used ellipsometry to determine γ for the phonon
modes. The extracted value of γ was ∼5 cm–1 for the GaN phonon modes and ∼15 cm–1 for
the AlN modes. Therefore, the XH IR losses are on the order of the
bulk constituents and thus can be modified without a dramatic rise
in optical losses.

One test of the validity of the experimentally
extracted XH dielectric
function is to make accurate predictions of the polariton modes. To
this end, we employed prism-coupling in the Otto geometry (see Methods for details),40,58,59 which provides experimental access to the dispersion
of the polariton modes for wave vectors near the light line, as shown
in the schematic of Figure 4a. Because of the multimode nature of the XH, multiple polariton
branches with different dispersions are observable. The experimental
dispersion maps of the XH are shown in Figure 4b, where several dispersing polariton modes
are clearly identified.

(a) Schematic of the
Otto-type prism coupling experiment40 that
probes the dispersion of XH polaritons for wavevectors near the light
line. Total internal reflection at the prism (KRS5, n = 2.4) backside launches evanescent waves (red shaded) with in-plane
momenta k, tunable via the incidence angle θext, that couple to evanescent modes in the XH (green shaded)
across a well-defined air gap of thickness d determined
by white-light interferometry.60 (b) Experimental
reflectance map for a series of normalized wavevectors k/k0, where k0 is the wavevector in vacuum, at fixed air gap thickness d = 3.0 μm. SPhP modes appear as minima (red–white
shading). (c–e) Experimental (blue) and calculated (solid orange
and dashed red) reflectance spectra for selected momenta.

To corroborate the experimental findings with the
XH concept, we
calculated the polaritonic dispersion spectra for the Otto geometry
using a transfer-matrix method for anisotropic materials.37 Two complementary models were employed to describe
the IR response of the SL structure: (i) the extracted XH dielectric
function (Figure 3a,b)
and (ii) an explicit calculation using the bulk dielectric functions
for both AlN and GaN thin layers. For very thin layers, the latter
model is expected to produce results that are equivalent to the effective-medium
theory. The results of the transfer matrix calculations for several
cuts through the dispersion are shown along with the respective experimental
spectra in Figure 4c–e. From these comparisons, we find very good agreement with
the model (i) using the XH dielectric function (solid orange). In
contrast, the multilayer calculations (ii) (dashed red) cannot reproduce
the observed polaritonic response.

The experimental dispersion
in Figure 4b suggests
five distinct polariton branches.
The highest-frequency mode arises from the SiC surface polariton that
is strongly modified by the XH film. Notably, with the thickness of
585 nm of the XH film, this mode repulsion is well outside the strong-coupling
regime61,62 and should instead be understood as an effective
index induced shift in the SiC SPhP response. The remaining four surface
polariton branches arise from the XH film itself and are only mildly
affected by the substrate as their penetration depth is comparable
to, or smaller than the XH total thickness. To verify this mode assignment,
we calculated the theoretical dispersion of the XH for different thicknesses
and substrates, see Sec. S8 and Figures S11 and S12 in the Supporting Information for details. The results
for Sample B are provided in Figure 5a and b, where we evaluated the imaginary part of the
reflection coefficient rp, which peaks
at polariton resonances.13 For small wavevectors
shown in Figure 5a,
multiple branches of strongly dispersing surface polaritons are visible,
in excellent agreement with the positions of the reflectance dips
extracted from the Otto geometry experimental data (Figure 4b–e).

calculations with reduced damping. The red dots in panel a mark the
positions of the reflectance dips in the Otto geometry experiments.
Hyperbolic mode progression is observed in b) for all four hyperbolic
regions. Additionally, a strongly elliptical mode is observed as indicated.
(c–f) Spatial electric field profiles for localized excitation
of hyperbolic modes of (c, e, f) type I and (d) type II. The mode
shown in panel e exhibits a rigid angle of propagation close to zero
since here the positive dielectric tensor component ε⊥ is nearly zero.

Strongly confined hyperbolic
and elliptical polariton modes of
the XH emerge at larger wavevectors as shown in Figure 5b, as expected from the hyperbolic and elliptical
regions of the XH dielectric function (Figure 3a). Notably, we observe three hyperbolic
bands of type I (830–860 cm–1, 599–625
cm–1, 555–571 cm–1), where
only one crystal axis exhibits a negative real part of the dielectric
function, which show the typical mode progression.13 Additionally, we also observe one hyperbolic band of type
II (two axes with negative permittivity; 740–770 cm–1) and one elliptical band (all three axes negative; 572–599
cm–1). As a consequence of the rapid dispersion
of the XH dielectric tensor and its anisotropy, the properties of
these polaritons vary strongly for the different Reststrahlen bands
and even within each band. This is in stark contrast to other hyperbolic
materials, where the respective positive component of the dielectric
tensor is typically constant throughout the hyperbolic dispersion.1,2,11,13 To illustrate this behavior, we calculated optical field profiles
of polariton modes from the various branches, with representative
examples shown in Figure 5c–f. The strong modulations of both components of the
dielectric tensor result in hyperbolic modes whose rigid angle of
propagation63−65 and propagation length vary drastically with small
spectral changes, see Figure S13 in the Supporting Information for a larger set of mode profiles.

Notably,
the XH concept provides two independent tuning parameters
of the polaritonic dispersion: (i) modification of the optic phonons
through the individual atomic-scale layer thicknesses as demonstrated
here, leading to modified number, positions, and widths of the polaritonic
bands; (ii) the total SL stack thickness through the number of SL
repeated layers changing the dispersion of the modes within each band.
The latter is shown in Figure S12 in the Supporting Information, where we calculated the polaritonic dispersion
for a series of XH total stack thicknesses. Therefore, the XH concept
provides numerous opportunities for super-resolution imaging and nanolithography3,4 with increased spectral flexibility.

An additional major benefit
of the XH approach is that it allows
for the combination of two materials to achieve a desired IR response,
while potentially maintaining their individual mechanical, electrical,
or optoelectronic functionality. In many instances, it is necessary
to combine other material properties (e.g., an accessible band gap
for active tuning66 or ferroelectric response67) with the polaritonic behavior at a given frequency.
For example, while AlN offers a Reststrahlen band that overlaps with
the 8–12 μm atmospheric window, its 6 eV bandgap implies
that free-carrier-based tuning methods66 are impractical. However, one can envision active devices based
on GaN/AlN SLs in which the accessible bandgap and controllable doping
of GaN can enable free-carrier-based SPPs alongside the SPhP modes.
In that case, the electromagnetic hybridization effect20 and carrier injection could offer routes toward
high-speed modulation of the XH polaritonic response.66

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the use of atomic-scale
AlN/GaN SLs for creating
hybrid optic phonon modes offering a distinct and tunable IR dielectric
function. For layer thicknesses approaching the atomic scale, new
phonon modes emerge such that the XHs IR properties are qualitatively
different from their bulk components. This implies that the resulting
SL does not behave as an effective medium composed of the two bulk
materials, but rather as a XH material with its own distinct phonon
modes and IR response. We have shown the tunability of the XH optic
phonons based on changes to the constituent layer thicknesses, with
frequency shifts >10 cm–1, and the emergence
of
new modes with only atomic-scale differences in the layer thickness
required. This provides the opportunity to manipulate the IR response,
including the frequencies of the polariton modes and control over
the magnitude and dispersion in the IR optical constants, with less
additional optical loss as compared to broadening the Reststrahlen
band via carrier doping. The AlN/GaN XH has multiple, strongly anisotropic
Reststrahlen bands, offering the potential for tailoring the spectral
dispersion of both elliptical and hyperbolic spectral regions. The
XH offers very large birefringence, with Δn in excess of unity over a large portion of the spectral range, reaching
values >10. Such extremely large values of birefringence offer
opportunities
in a number of application spaces including on-chip optical elements,
polarization control for waveguides, hyperlensing, and enhancing local
emitters. In addition, the large birefringence of the XH makes it
a promising material for probing the physics of propagating Dyakonov
surface waves.68 By manipulating the IR
response, while maintaining other material parameters, XHs provide
immense potential for multifunctional nanophotonic devices, for instance
by layer-selective ultrafast modulation of the carrier densities.
We believe that the implementation and further development of this
XH approach will lead to significant advances in IR nanophotonic devices.

Methods
Sample Growth
We used radio frequency (RF) plasma-assisted
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow the polar epitaxial heterostructures
on 3-in. diameter metal-polar semi-insulating 4H- and 6H-SiC substrates.
The substrates were commercially polished using chemical-mechanical
polishing to an epi-ready finish and were used as received. The reactive
nitrogen was generated using an RF plasma source fed by ultrahigh
purity N2, which was further purified by an in-line purifier.
The Ga and Al fluxes were generated using conventional dual-filament
effusion cells. Other details about the MBE growth conditions were
given in an earlier publication.69 X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku system
that employed a rotating Cu anode to produce Cu-Ka radiation. AlN/GaN
SL thicknesses were estimated by fitting satellite peaks in XRD scans
and high-resolution cross-sectional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) images. The SL of Sample A was grown on ∼50
nm AlN buffer layer. The SL consisted of 50 alternating layers of
AlN and GaN and was fabricated with a thickness gradient across the
SiC wr ranging from 2 nm to 3 nm for both, AlN and GaN layer thicknesses.
For Sample B, there are 500 alternating layers of GaN and AlN, with
average layer thicknesses of 1.35 ± 0.13 nm (4.78 monolayers)
and 1.17 ± 0.05 nm (4.13 monolayers), respectively.

Electron Microscopy
Preparation and Imaging
Cross-sectional
STEM specimens were prepared as lift-out sections with an FEI Helios,
a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope. Initial cuts were
made at 30 kV, and final polishing was performed at 8 kV. STEM examination
was carried out using a Nion UltraSTEM200-X operated at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. Bright field, medium, and high-angle annular dark-field
images were acquired. The image magnification calibration was verified
each session using lattice measurements of evaporated gold nanoparticles.

Ellipsometry
Infrared ellipsometry was performed using
a J.A. Woollam Mark II IR-VASE spectroscopic ellipsometer. The sample
was mounted in the upright position and aligned using the standard
four-quadrant detector to be positioned at the center of rotation.
The broadband incident light was provided by a SiC glow-bar and was
detected using a DLaTGS detector. The incident light was polarized
and detected using a polarizer and analyzer combination, and the various
ratios of the p- and s-polarization components of the reflected light
were plotted as Ψ and Δ, as is standard for ellipsometric
measurements. The Ψ and Δ signals were both measured as
a function of frequency (250–8000 cm–1) at
angles of incidence of 45, 55, 65, and 75° using the standard
θ/2θ geometry. The collected data were modeled using the
WVASE software and based on the phonon frequencies extracted from
the SHG measurements provided the starting parameters for the best
fit. Following least-squares fitting, the resultant dielectric function
was extracted.

Second Harmonic Spectroscopy
The
second-harmonic phonon
spectra38,44 were obtained using an IR free-electron
laser (FEL)43 as a light source, which
provided widely tunable, ∼0.5% bandwidth laser pulses in the
mid- to far-IR. Using a noncollinear autocorrelator geometry in reflection,
both FEL beams were focused onto the SL wafer in spatial and temporal
overlap, incident at angles α1i = 28° and α2i = 62°, respectively. The SHG signal emerged spatially separated
from the reflected fundamental beams and was detected using a LN2-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector (InfraRed
Associates). Both incoming beams as well as the detected SHG beam
were p-polarized. Optical long- and short-pass filters were used in
the incoming and detected beams, respectively, to suppress intrinsic
higher harmonics of the FEL and scattered fundamental light. Simultaneously,
the intensity of the reflected beam incident at α2i = 62° was recorded using a pyroelectric detector. Varying the
FEL undulator gap allowed for tuning of the FEL center frequency ω,
which thereby provided the SHG and reflectance spectra shown in Figure 2. Spectra were recorded
at different locations on the SL wafer corresponding to varying absolute
and relative thicknesses of the AlN and GaN layers, which were then
extracted from XRD measurements for the representative examples shown
in Figure 2. The full
data set of the SHG spectra is provided in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information.

Otto-Geometry Measurements
Prism coupling in the Otto
geometry was achieved using a triangular KRS5 (n ≈
2.4) prism in total internal reflection, which provided the in-plane
momenta necessary to couple to SPhPs.40 The prism was mounted on a motorized holder, which allowed for a
controlled adjustment of the air gap width d, which
was read out by white light interferometry,60 see Figure 4a. The
prism-sample assembly itself was mounted on a motorized rotation stage
to vary the incidence angle θext, and consequently
the in-plane momentum k = ω/cn sin θext of the incoming wave,
thereby providing the means to excite SPhPs at different points along
their dispersion. Scanning the FEL center frequency ω across
the XH’s Reststrahlen region while detecting the reflected
intensity resulted in the reflectance spectra shown in Figure 4. The data were normalized
to a reference spectrum taken at large air gaps (d > 100 μm), where no light could be coupled to the SPhP
modes.
This measurement was repeated at various incidence angles θext, and thus in-plane momenta k, to map out
the polariton dispersion of the XH. Since multiple modes with different
critical coupling behavior appear in the XH structure, the data shown
in Figure 4 were recorded
at a fixed air gap width of d = 3.0 μm.

Transfer
Matrix Calculations
The theoretical reflectance
spectra in Figure 1 as well as the theoretical Otto geometry spectra in Figure 4 were acquired using a transfer
matrix algorithm specifically accounting for absorptive anisotropic
media.37 The algorithm can treat an arbitrary
number of layers, allowing to directly compare spectra for the XH
and the explicit multilayer stack using the bulk dielectric functions
of SiC, AlN, and GaN. The bulk parameters for SiC, AlN, and GaN are
reported in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The dispersion plots in Figure 5a and b were generated evaluating the reflection coefficient
for p-polarized evanescent excitation (k/k0 > 1) of the air/XH/SiC structure. The theoretical
dispersion lines were extracted from the same type of calculations;
however, with reduced damping of the XH by artificially lowering all
phonon dampings by a factor of 5 in the parametrized dielectric function,
see Supporting Information for details.

Optical Field Profiles
Simulations for Figure 5c–f were performed in
CST studio suite70 using the frequency
domain solver. To approximate Sample B within a finite 3D model, a
unit cell with a height of 7.585 μm (585 nm of the XH material
on top of 1 μm of SiC, with a 3 μm gap above and below)
and in-plane dimensions of 21 μm (10 μm on either side
of the dipole, with a 500 nm gap at the period edges) by 50 nm was
chosen, which allow full directional propagation of the hyperbolic
modes while minimizing nearest neighbor interactions. Unit cell boundaries
were used at the in-plane edges of the substrate. Localized excitation
of hyperbolic polaritons was facilitated by a port-mode dipole oriented
normal to the sample (length 200 nm), placed 50 nm above the sample
surface. The XH dielectric function with reduced damping was used
for clarity.

Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT)
The Γ-point
phonon frequencies were obtained using the first-principles approach
as implemented in the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.71 In this work, we used the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA)72 of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE)73 for the exchange–correlation
functional. The electronic wave functions were expanded in the plane
wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 40 Ry. The Brillouin-zone
was sampled with a grid of 18 × 18 × 2 k-points according to the Monkhort-Pack method.74 To compare theoretical results with those reported in the
experiment, the GaN/AlN heterostructure was created using five monolayers
of GaN and four monolayers of AlN. The geometry of the resultant structure
was optimized and the phonon frequencies for the ground-state structure
were calculated within DFPT.75−78 Originating from long-ranged dipole–dipole
interactions, the LO–TO splitting at the zone center (q⃗ → 0) was taken into account by including
the nonanalytical contribution to the dynamical matrix.
