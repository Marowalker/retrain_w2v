Nanoscale
organization is crucial to stimulating an immune response.
Using self-assembling proteins as multimerization platforms provides
a safe and immunogenic system to vaccinate against otherwise weakly
immunogenic antigens. Such multimerization platforms are generally
based on icosahedral viruses and have led to vaccines given to millions
of people. It is unclear whether synthetic protein nanoassemblies
would show similar potency. Here we take the computationally designed
porous dodecahedral i301 60-mer and rationally engineer this particle,
giving a mutated i301 (mi3) with improved particle uniformity and
stability. To simplify the conjugation of this nanoparticle, we employ
a SpyCatcher fusion of mi3, such that an antigen of interest linked
to the SpyTag peptide can spontaneously couple through isopeptide
bond formation (Plug-and-Display). SpyCatcher-mi3 expressed solubly
to high yields in Escherichia coli, giving more than
10-fold greater yield than a comparable phage-derived icosahedral
nanoparticle, SpyCatcher-AP205. SpyCatcher-mi3 nanoparticles showed
high stability to temperature, freeze–thaw, lyophilization,
and storage over time. We demonstrate approximately 95% efficiency
coupling to different transmission-blocking and blood-stage malaria
antigens. Plasmodium falciparum CyRPA was conjugated
to SpyCatcher-mi3 nanoparticles and elicited a high avidity antibody
response, comparable to phage-derived virus-like particles despite
their higher valency and RNA cargo. The simple production, precise
derivatization, and exceptional ruggedness of this nanoscaffold should
facilitate broad application for nanobiotechnology and vaccine development.

Nanoassembly
creates great opportunities
for studying and modulating biological systems.1−3 Decorating functional
units onto nanoparticles can enhance function in areas including catalysis,4,5 imaging,6 and therapy.7 Protein-based nanoparticles, compared to abiotic synthetic
polymers, may have the advantage of atomically precise assembly, but
at the cost of low stability and difficulty in scaling up production.8,9 Exploiting the natural immunogenicity of proteinaceous cages as
well as the multimerization of antigens is crucially important to
the development of the next generation of vaccines.10,11 Developing a modular and robust nanoscaffold with scalable, low-cost
production could contribute to major challenges in human and animal
health,12 including vaccines to rapidly
evolving pathogens (e.g., HIV, malaria)
or zoonotic outbreaks (e.g., Ebola
virus, Rift Valley fever). Such a platform would also be important
for vaccine stockpiling against pandemics and for vaccine delivery
to low-resource areas.13,14

Traditional vaccines based
on whole-killed or live-attenuated viruses
are good at stimulating immune responses but pose a greater risk of
rare adverse events.15,16 Recombinant subunit vaccines,
while safer, are often insufficiently immunogenic to progress through
clinical development.17−20 By using virus-like particles (VLPs) as multimerization platforms,
antigens can be delivered to the immune system on a highly immunogenic
scaffold in a safe fashion.10 The immunogenicity
of VLPs is a product of efficient draining to lymph nodes, efficient
uptake by dendritic cells, and a highly repetitive surface that promotes
B-cell cross-linking and activation.21−24

Conjugation of antigens
onto a VLP or nanoparticle can be achieved
through a variety of techniques including chemical conjugation,25 genetic fusion,26,27 or bio-orthogonal
chemistry with unnatural amino acids.28 Genetic fusion frequently runs into difficulty from inefficient
folding of complex antigens.29−31 Chemical coupling faces challenges
from the heterogeneity in coupling site and particle coverage.32 We recently established another method for VLP
decoration, exploiting the spontaneous isopeptide bond that forms
between the protein domain SpyCatcher and its peptide partner SpyTag.18 This ability to separate antigen and scaffold
production through modular assembly, termed “Plug-and-Display”
(Figure 1a), allows
optimization of production conditions for both components and may
shorten time from development to manufacture of a new vaccine.33 These Plug-and-Display platforms were based
on SpyTag or SpyCatcher linked to the coat protein cp3 from the bacteriophage
AP205. Spy-AP205 VLPs have been investigated as vaccine candidates
against a number of targets, including malaria and cancer.18,34,35 However, despite the fact that
Spy-AP205 VLPs are good at stimulating the immune system, a number
of concerns hinder their clinical development, including limited solubility,
stability, and yield (Figure 1a).

(e) SpyCatcher-mi3 showed greater stability to aggregation. SpyCatcher-i301
or SpyCatcher-mi3 were stored for 5 weeks at 4 °C and analyzed

Protein cages from both nonviral
and viral origin have gained increased
interest expanding on possible applications in the fields of vaccine
technology and biotechnology.36−38 Recently, protein nanocages that
mimic the structure of VLPs have been computationally designed, although
their immunogenicity remains untested.39 The i301 nanocage is based on the 2-keto-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate
(KDPG) aldolase from the Entner–Doudoroff pathway of the hyperthermophilic
bacterium Thermotoga maritima. i301 has five mutations
that alter the interface between the wild-type protein trimer, promoting
assembly into a higher order dodecahedral 60-mer (Figure 1b). In this paper we use rational
design to improve i301 stability and establish modular antigen coupling
by fusing SpyCatcher to the N-terminus of the protein. We then characterize
the conformation, ruggedness, and immunogenicity of the SpyCatcher-mi3
scaffold to evaluate its potential to accelerate vaccine development.

Results
and Discussion
To create a Plug-and-Display nanoscaffold,
ΔN1-SpyCatcher
was genetically fused to the N-terminus of the previously described
i301 sequence.39 A C-tag was installed
on the C-terminus to allow more efficient downstream processing for
vaccine applications.40,41 This construct expressed solubly
in E. coli, and particles were purified from cell
lysate by C-tag resin affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion
chromatography (Figure 1c). We found difficulties during purification arising from aggregation
of the cell lysate. We also saw a double-banded SpyCatcher-i301 product
by SDS-PAGE, which converted to a single band upon reduction, indicative
of intrachain disulfide bond formation (Figure 1c). Therefore, we designed mutations of two
surface-exposed cysteines C76A and C100A (Figure 1b, Supporting Information, Figure S1a) to avoid potential disulfide bond-mediated heterogeneity.
Evidence from sequence conservation of KDPG aldolases indicates that
alanine is the preferred amino acid at position 76 (Supporting Information, Figure S1b). Removing complicating disulfide
bond formation or the need for the presence of reducing agent39 would also assist the conjugation of many antigens
that require intact disulfide bonds. We termed this mutated i301 sequence
mi3. SpyCatcher-mi3 was efficiently purified under the same conditions,
with no double-banded species visible by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1c).

After purification,
SpyCatcher-mi3 gave 2-fold higher yield than
SpyCatcher-i301 (Figure 1d). This yield is more than 10-fold higher than we could achieve
for SpyCatcher-AP205, despite extensive optimization of DNA constructs,
bacterial strains, and conditions for growth and induction (Figure 1d).18 23 mg/L is close to the maximum we achieve for any soluble
protein in shake-flask E. coli culture.20,42,43 Higher yields should be accessible
through fermentation.44

The mutations
in SpyCatcher-mi3 also eliminated the aggregation
of SpyCatcher-i301 seen by dynamic light scattering (DLS) after 5
weeks of storage (Figure 1e). Therefore, all further studies were performed with SpyCatcher-mi3.

Size-exclusion chromatography of SpyCatcher-mi3 showed a single
major peak eluting in the expected megadalton range (a monomer of
SpyCatcher-mi3 is 34 kDa, the 60-meric nanoparticle MW is estimated
at 60 × 34 kDa = 2.0 MDa) (Figure 2a). On this trace we also observed the elution of lower
molecular weight species (in the range of 1–158 kDa based on
the marker), which are likely unassembled monomeric or trimeric species
(Figure 2a) and were
removed by our size-exclusion purification. Quantifying purified SpyCatcher-mi3
nanoparticles by DLS gave a uniform peak of the hydrodynamic radius
(Rh) 16.8 ± 5.7 nm (Figure 2b). Negative-staining transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) of SpyCatcher-mi3 indicated assembly of
the expected dodecahedra (Figure 2c), with a diameter of 26 ± 2.0 nm (mean ±1
s.d., n = 100) (Figure 2d). As expected, this size is smaller than
the hydrodynamic size from DLS.

To validate SpyCatcher-mi3 reactivity, we performed
initial trials
with the model protein SpyTag-MBP (E. coli maltose-binding
protein).45 Upon mixing with excess SpyTag-MBP,
a clear SpyCatcher-mi3 molecular weight band shift was observed on
SDS-PAGE, indicating covalent bond formation (Figure 3a). The reaction proceeded to 91% conjugation
after 16 h at 25 °C (Supporting Information, Figure S2a). We tested conjugation of SpyCatcher-mi3 to immunologically
relevant SpyTagged antigens against malaria (Figure 3b–d). Cysteine-rich interdomain region
(CIDR) is a variable domain type from the parasite Plasmodium
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 family (PfEMP1).46 Pfs25 is a malaria transmission-blocking antigen
that has shown promise in previous vaccine trials.17,47,48 Cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA)
is involved in P. falciparum merozoite invasion into
erythrocytes. CyRPA is highly conserved and is another promising malaria
vaccine candidate.49,50 These antigens were conjugated
to SpyTag at either the N-terminus (CIDR) or the C-terminus (Pfs25
and CyRPA). Antigens were expressed in E. coli (SpyTag-CIDR,
30 kDa, 4 disulfide bonds) or mammalian cells (CyRPA-SpyTag, 42 kDa,
5 disulfide bonds; Pfs25-SpyTag, 21 kDa, 11 disulfide bonds).18 Conjugation efficiency ranged from 91 to 96%
(Figure 3e). Proper
assembly of conjugated SpyCatcher-mi3 was validated by DLS. SpyCatcher-mi3
had a hydrodynamic radius of 17.6 ± 4.4 nm before conjugation
and 20.9 ± 5.8 nm after conjugation to CyRPA-SpyTag (Figure 3f). Thus, SpyCatcher-mi3
was able to react with high efficiency to a range of antigens, bearing
either N- or C-terminally fused SpyTag and produced in eukaryotic
or bacterial cells.

Figure 3 SpyCatcher-mi3 nanoparticles efficiently reacted with
a variety
of antigens. Conjugation was performed with SpyCatcher-mi3 in a 1:3
ratio with antigen at 25 °C for 16 h, followed by analysis on
SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. (a) SpyTag-MBP. (b) SpyTag-CIDR.

s.d.).

For a nanoparticle platform to
transition from small-scale laboratory
production to clinical and field-settings, it is desirable that the
platform is robust and tolerates long-term storage and varying temperature.51 Inactivation of vaccines through failure of
the cold-chain is a major challenge for the cost and efficacy of vaccines
in the developing world.52,53 In addition, using
this modular vaccine assembly strategy, it would be desirable to be
able to stockpile the platform, to use in a newly emerging medical
or veterinary outbreak challenge.54 To
test nanoparticle heat stability, purified SpyCatcher-mi3 was incubated
in neutral buffer at temperatures ranging from 25 to 95 °C for
1 h. Aggregates were removed by centrifugation, and we measured the
proportion of protein in the soluble fraction. Up to 75 °C, at
least 80% of the protein remained in the soluble fraction (Figure 4a). At elevated temperatures
a small increase was observed in the hydrodynamic radius, as measured
by DLS (Supporting Information, Figure S2b).

Figure 4 SpyCatcher-mi3 nanoparticles were robust to heating, freezing,
and lyophilization. (a) SpyCatcher-mi3 remained soluble after high
temperatures. SpyCatcher-mi3 was incubated for 1 h at the indicated
temperatures. Samples were centrifuged to remove aggregates, and soluble
protein was quantified by densitometry (mean ±1 s.d., n = 3). (b) SpyCatcher-mi3 remained soluble after freeze–thaw.
Soluble protein for SpyCatcher-mi3 was quantified, as in (a), after
1 or 4 cycles of freeze–thawing ±1 M trehalose (mean ±1
s.d., n = 3). (c) Freeze–thaw did not change
nanoassembly. DLS of SpyCatcher-mi3 before and after four rounds of

or after lyophilization and reconstitution in the same volume. (e)

Reaction of SpyCatcher-mi3 with SpyTag-MBP at 25 °C for 16 h
was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining.

Many protein nanoparticles are disrupted by freezing.55,56 After four rounds of freeze–thawing, ∼15% of SpyCatcher-mi3
was lost to aggregation. However, addition of the common sugar stabilizer
trehalose minimized aggregation, resulting in only 3% loss of protein
over four rounds (Figure 4b). Beyond the solubility, the SpyCatcher-mi3 particles also
remained well-formed after four rounds of freeze–thawing, based
on DLS (Figure 4c).

We also evaluated stability to lyophilization. The SpyCatcher-mi3
nanoparticle could be lyophilized and reconstituted without damage
to the particle shape, based on DLS (Figure 4d), or to the solubility (Figure 4e). After lyophilization, reconstituted
SpyCatcher-mi3 retained good reactivity, as tested by conjugation
to SpyTag-MBP (Figure 4f).

For vaccine formulation and to facilitate reaction with
antigens
which are not soluble themselves at high concentration, it is valuable
for the nanoparticles to have high solubility. We found that SpyCatcher-mi3
was highly soluble and could be concentrated to >1 mM (36 mg/mL)
(Supporting
Information, Figure S2c). This high concentration
was sustainable following freeze–thaw or storage at 4 °C
for 1 week (Supporting Information, Figure S2c).

To streamline modular nanoparticle assembly, it was interesting
to explore whether the nanoparticles could conjugate with target proteins
without purification of each partner. We added purified SpyTag-mClover3
to E. coli cleared lysate expressing SpyCatcher-mi3.
mClover3 remains fluorescent in SDS-PAGE, as long as the sample is
not boiled before loading. Using fluorescent imaging and Coomassie
staining, we saw substantial depletion of the SpyCatcher-mi3 band
and formation of a SpyCatcher-mi3:SpyTag-mClover3 conjugate band (Supporting
Information, Figure S2d), indicating that
nanoparticle decoration can occur without purification.

In considering
the mi3 nanoparticle scaffold for vaccine applications,
it was important to check for similarity to human sequences, to minimize
the chance of activating an autoimmune response. No ortholog of KDPG
aldolase exists in humans.57 Sequence alignment
of mi3 against the human protein database using BLAST revealed no
substantial similarity, through coincidence, to any human protein.
The top hit was to a 32 amino acid fragment of Interleukin-1 receptor-associated
kinase 3 (IRAK3), giving a score of 64, sequence identity 40.6%, and E-value: 9.4 (Supporting Information, Figure S3a). E-values of 0.1 or greater are
generally not considered to be significant.58 In comparison, a similar alignment was done for ΔN1-SpyCatcher
which is an N-terminally truncated version of SpyCatcher for reduced
immunogenicity.59 The top hit was a fragment
of the Hemicentin-2 human gene that gave a score of 62, sequence identity
29.7%, and E-value: 2.8 (Supporting Information, Figure S3b).

Having established good assembly,
reactivity, and robustness of
the SpyCatcher-mi3 platform, we investigated its immunogenicity. Because
of the urgent need to improve malaria vaccination,60,61 we focused on immunizing against CyRPA. We validated conjugation
of CyRPA-SpyTag to SpyCatcher-mi3 by SDS-PAGE, and free antigen was
removed using a high molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) membrane (Figure 5a,b). Mice were injected
intramuscularly with 1 μg total CyRPA for each group. CyRPA-SpyTag
alone was compared to the same antigen multimerized using SpyCatcher-mi3
or the previous leading nanoassembly platform for Plug-and-Display
SpyCatcher-AP205.18,34 All immunizations were performed
with AddaVax, a potent squalene-oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant based
on the MF59 adjuvant that is licensed and used in influenza vaccines.62−64 Mice were boosted with the same dosage at 14 days, and antibody
titer against CyRPA was measured after prime or postboost via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Figure 5c). After priming,
6/6 mice in each group responded to the nanoparticle platforms, while
4/6 responded to the monomeric antigen (Figure 5d). This indicates that there is variability
in the immune response to free antigen. However, this difference in
titer did not reach significance (Figure 5d).

was conjugated with CyRPA-SpyTag and analyzed as in (a). (c) Time

enhanced antibody avidity. The avidity of anti-CyRPA antibodies was
assayed, based on resistance to NaSCN-induced dissociation. In each
case, the value is plotted for each mouse. The horizontal bar represents
the median and a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
multiple comparison post-test was performed. * p <
0.05; n.s. p > 0.05; n = 6.

After boosting, 6/6 mice in each
group had an anti-CyRPA antibody
response at day 27. There was not a significantly different response
comparing SpyCatcher-AP205 multimerization against monomeric antigen
(Figure 5e). There
was a significantly higher antibody response with SpyCatcher-mi3 assembly
compared to monomeric antigen (p = 0.011, n = 6, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
multiple comparison post-test) (Figure 5e).

The avidity of CyRPA-specific antibodies
was analyzed at day 28
(14 days postboost) using a sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) antibody displacement
ELISA.65 The molar concentration of NaSCN
required to reduce the A405 to 50% (IC50) compared to untreated samples was determined. Both SpyCatcher-mi3
and SpyCatcher-AP205 induced CyRPA-specific antibodies with significantly
higher avidity compared to CyRPA-SpyTag (p = 0.028
for SpyCatcher-mi3; p = 0.011 for SpyCatcher-AP205, n = 6, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
multiple comparison post-test) (Figure 5f). There was no significant difference in avidity
between SpyCatcher-mi3 and SpyCatcher-AP205 (Figure 5f).

Conclusion
Nanoparticles must fulfill
a stringent series of criteria to be
suitable for medical application.2,7,8 This work establishes a simple and robust nanoscaffold,
suitable for modular multimerization of complex proteins just by mixing.
The experiments here also provide insight into nanoparticle features
important for high stability and for potent stimulation of an immune
response.

Rational modification of a protein computationally
designed to
assemble into a dodecahedron (i301) enhanced the uniformity of the
isolated protein, while increasing both the yield and stability of
the resultant nanoparticle. The cysteines mutated in i301 are not
accessible for intersubunit disulfide bond formation in the predicted
folded structure.39 Therefore, consideration
of rare misfolded structures may be important to obtain robust nanoscaffolds.

SpyCatcher-mi3 shows various positive features toward application
in vaccine assembly. The platform is robust to freezing, heating,
and lyophilization. The high thermoresilience is consistent with the
hyperthermophilic origin of the aldolase, suggesting that the mutations
to generate i301 and then mi3 did not greatly impair the protein stability.
SpyCatcher itself is from a mesophilic organism, Streptococcus
pyogenes.66 However, SpyCatcher
has shown the ability to enhance protein thermal resilience in the
context of cyclizing enzymes.67,68

For the malaria
antigen CyRPA, multimerizing on the SpyCatcher-mi3
scaffold increased the antibody response compared to immunization
with monomeric antigen. Analysis of the avidity of the anti-CyRPA
specific antibodies also indicated a qualitatively superior response
from multimerized antigen. The importance of high avidity antibodies
has been emphasized for resisting HIV immune escape69,70 and for increasing antibody antiviral effector function.71 It might be predicted that AP205 would be a
more immunogenic nanoscaffold than mi3, having a higher valency (maximum
180 antigens on AP205 versus 60 on mi3)72 and efficiently encapsulating RNA, which can
stimulate Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 8 signaling.73 Also, AP205 cp3 forms a conventional tightly packed capsid
surface, whereas i301 has large pores. In fact, we found comparable
antibody titer and avidity from immunization using SpyCatcher-AP205
or SpyCatcher-mi3. Therefore, the more efficient production by E. coli may make SpyCatcher-mi3 a more favorable nanoscaffold
for future development. A limitation of the SpyCatcher-mi3 platform
is that it is important that the protein to be conjugated does not
self-associate and thereby promote aggregation. Also, we have not
tested the induction of cytotoxic T cell responses using SpyCatcher-mi3,
where one would expect viral vectored vaccines to be superior.74

The simple production of SpyCatcher-mi3,
accessible to any molecular
biology laboratory, should facilitate its widespread use by the research
community as well as favoring potential clinical development. The
lack of sequence homology between SpyCatcher-mi3 and the human genome
reduces potential concerns about the platform inducing an autoimmune
response. Beyond mi3, there are a number of computationally derived
protein nanocages that vary in composition, structure, and cargo packaging.75,76 Thus, future work in synthetic nanobiology may establish the factors
maximizing nanoparticle immunogenicity, such as the ideal antigen
spacing, number, and orientation.32,77,78

Methods
Cloning
Constructs were cloned using standard PCR methods
and Gibson assembly. Inserts were verified by Sanger sequencing. In
all cases, the version of SpyCatcher used was ΔN1-SpyCatcher.79 The i301 insert39 was synthesized by Genscript. pET28a-SpyCatcher-i301 has the organization:
SpyCatcher, (GGS)4 spacer, i301, GSG spacer, C-tag. pET28a-SpyCatcher-mi3
(GenBank accession no. MH425515 and Addgene plasmid ID 112255) has
the same organization, except for mutations C76A and C100A (numbering
based on i301 from Hsia et al., Supporting Information Figure S1a)39 introduced
by Gibson cloning. pENTR4-LPTOS-CyRPA-SpyTag has the organization:
IgG leader of V-kappa sequence, P. falciparum CyRPA
(3D7), (GSG)3 spacer, SpyTag, GSG spacer, C-tag (GenBank
accession no. MH425516) in the pENTR4-LPTOS backbone.80 pENTR4-LPTOS-CyRPA has the organization: IgG leader of
V-kappa sequence, CyRPA, GGGS spacer, C-tag. pENTR4-LPTOS-Pfs25-SpyTag
for expression in mammalian cells has been previously described (GenBank
accession no. KU302811.1).18 pET28a-SpyTag-MBP66 (Addgene plasmid ID 35050), pET28-SpyTag-mClover3,81 pGEM-SpyCatcher-AP205 cp3,18 and pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07)18 have been previously described.

Expression of SpyCatcher-mi3
Particles
The pET28a expression
plasmid of either SpyCatcher-i301 or SpyCatcher-mi3 was transformed
into E. coli BL21 (DE3)-RIPL (Agilent), and cells
were grown for 16 h at 37 °C on LB-Agar plates containing 50
μg/mL kanamycin. A single colony was picked into a 10 mL starter
culture of LB medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubated
for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. The entire 10 mL culture
was then diluted into 1 L LB containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and
incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. At A600 0.8, cultures were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and grown
for 16–20 h with shaking at 200 rpm at 22 °C.

Purification
of SpyCatcher-mi3 Particles
One 500 mL
culture-derived pellet was resuspended in 10 mL lysis buffer [25 mM
Tris·HCl pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme, 1 mg/mL cOmplete
mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C] and rotated at 25 °C
for 1 h. The lysate was then sonicated on ice for 5 min with rounds
of 10 s on and 10 s off, before centrifugation at 16,900 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Capture Select C-tag Affinity Matrix (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) (7.5 mL), equilibrated to 25 mM Tris·HCl pH
8.5 with 150 mM NaCl at 4 °C, was added to cleared lysate and
incubated on a tube roller at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then
added to a polyprep column by gravity filtration and washed with 10
column volumes of 25 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.5 with 150 mM NaCl at 4
°C. Elution buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4 with 2 M MgCl2 at 4 °C) was added to the column and incubated for 5
min before each elution. Protein in elution was monitored by A280. Total eluate was then diluted with a 10×
stock of 250 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.5 with 1.5 M NaCl at 4 °C,
before concentrating in a 20 mL 100 kDa MWCO Vivaspin ultrafiltration
unit (Sartorius) and applying to a previously equilibrated HiPrep
16/60 Sephacryl S-400 or S-500 HR (GE Healthcare) on a fast protein
liquid chromatography (FPLC) system AKTA Purifier 10 (GE Healthcare).
The mobile-phase column buffer was 25 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.5 with
150 mM NaCl, and the applied flow-rate was 1.0 mL/min, all at 4°C.
A high molecular weight gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad, Cat. No.
151–1901) was run on the same column with the same buffer and
flow-rate specification. Elution of proteins and standard was monitored
at A280. The SpyCatcher-mi3 elution in
the 65–90 mL range was collected. Collected fractions were
concentrated using a 100 kDa spin column, and the concentration was
determined using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).

Expression of SpyCatcher-AP205 VLPs
C41 E.
coli cells, a kind gift of Anthony Watts (University of Oxford),
were transformed with pGEM-SpyCatcher-AP20518 (GenBank accession number KU302810) and grown for 16 h at 37 °C
on an LB-agar plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. A single
colony was picked into a 10 mL starter culture of 2×TY medium
containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C
with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h. The entire 10 mL culture was then
diluted into 1 L 2×TY containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and
incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. At A600 of 0.5, cultures were induced with 0.42 mM IPTG and
grown for 4–6 h with shaking at 200 rpm at 30 °C. Following
the conditions for expression of SpyCatcher-mi3 above decreased the
yield of SpyCatcher-AP205.

Purification of SpyCatcher-AP205 VLPs
One 1 L culture-derived
pellet was resuspended at 25 °C for 1 h in 10 mL lysis buffer
[20 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 75
mM imidazole, 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, 1 mg/mL cOmplete mini EDTA-free
protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM PMSF, 25 U/mL benzonase]. The lysate
was sonicated 4 times for 30 s with a minimum of 1 min between each
pulse. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 16,900 g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then filtered through
a Minisart NML Glass Fiber Filter (1.2 μm pore size) (Sartorius)
and then through a Syringe Filter (0.45 μm pore size) (StarLab,
cat. no. E4780-1453). The filtrate was incubated with 250 U benzonase
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 25 °C. One mL of packed Ni-NTA agarose
(Qiagen) equilibrated to 75 mM imidazole in buffer [20 mM Tris·HCl
pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20] was added to the cleared
lysate and incubated on a tube roller for 30 min at 4 °C. The
resin was then added to a polyprep column by gravity filtration and
washed 5 times with 10 column volumes of wash buffer at 4 °C
[50 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20,
pH 7.8]. For elution, the polyprep column was capped, 1 mL of elution
buffer added [2 M imidazole, 50 mM glycine, 25 mM sodium citrate,
0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 8.5 at 4 °C], the resin incubated for
5 min, and the process repeated until all protein was eluted. Eluate
was centrifuged for 30 min at 16,900 g at 4 °C,
before transfer to a 300 kDa molecular weight cutoff cellulose ester
dialysis tubing (SpectrumLabs) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C
against 1000-fold excess of 50 mM glycine, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1%
(v/v) Tween-20, pH 8.0, for buffer exchange and depletion of VLP monomer.
Dialysis was repeated an additional two times for 3 h. After dialysis,
the sample was centrifuged once more at 16,900 g at
4 °C for 30 min to remove any aggregates.

Protein concentration
was measured using the BCA assay kit. Protein concentration for nanoparticles
refers to the concentration of monomer. The comparison of nanoparticle
yield was based upon BCA assays of preps grown and purified on independent
days (n = 3).

Expression and Purification
of Monomeric Proteins
To
express CyRPA-SpyTag, suspension Expi293HEK cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
were cultured in Expi293 Expression media (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
with 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
cells were grown in a humidified Multitron Cell incubator (Infors
HT) at 37 °C with 7% CO2, rotating at 110–125
rpm. The cells were transiently transfected with either CyRPA-SpyTag
or CyRPA using the ExpiFectamine 293 transfection kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Cells at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/mL
were transfected with 2.7 μL ExpiFectamine 293 Reagent per 1
μg of plasmid DNA. ExpiFectamine transfection enhancers (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) were added 16–18 h post-transfection, and
cell supernatant was harvested 4 days post-transfection. Cell supernatants
were centrifuged at 218 g to remove residual cells
and filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters, and 1 mg/mL cOmplete
mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail was added. Cell supernatants
(40 mL for CyRPA and 240 mL for CyRPA-SpyTag) were added to Capture
Select C-tag Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated
on a tube roller at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then added
to a polyprep column by gravity filtration and washed with 10 column
volumes of wash buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 at
4 °C). Elution buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, 2 M MgCl2, pH 7.4 at 4 °C) was added to the column and incubated for
5 min before each elution. Protein in elution was monitored by A280. Total eluate was concentrated in a 20 mL
10 kDa MWCO Vivaspin ultrafiltration unit (Sartorius) and applied
to a previously equilibrated HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column
(GE Healthcare) on an AKTA Purifier 10. The mobile-phase buffer was
either 50 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4 (CyRPA-SpyTag) or 50
mM Tris·borate pH 7.25 (CyRPA), and the applied flow-rate was
1.0 mL/min all at 4 °C. Elution of proteins was monitored by A280. Elutions were collected in the 74–97
mL range for CyRPA-SpyTag and in the 60–72 mL range for CyRPA.

SpyTag-MBP and SpyTag-CIDR were expressed in E. coli as described.18 SpyTag-mClover3 was also
expressed in E. coli as described.81

Reactions
SpyCatcher-mi3 at 10 μM
was reacted
with 3× molar excess of CyRPA-SpyTag, SpyTag-CIDR, SpyTag-MBP,
or Pfs25-SpyTag for 16 h at 25 °C in 25 mM Tris·HCl, 150
mM NaCl, pH 8.5 at 4 °C. Coupling efficiency was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining.

Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)
Protein samples were
centrifuged for 30 min at 16,900 g at 4 °C to
remove any aggregates, and 20 μL was loaded into a reusable
cuvette. Proteins were diluted in their native buffer to a suitable
concentration enabling stable measurement. The buffer used to dilute
samples was also centrifuged for 30 min at 16,900 g before use. Each protein sample was measured at 20 °C using
an Omnisizer (Viscotek) with 10 scans of 10 s each. The intensity
distribution from the scans was plotted, and the mean and standard
deviation calculated in Excel. To compare aggregation after long-term
storage, SpyCatcher-mi3 and SpyCatcher-i301 samples at 30 μM
in 25 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.5 were sterile-filtered
and stored in Parafilm-wrapped microcentrifuge tubes at 4 °C
for 5 weeks, before processing as above.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
SpyCatcher-mi3
nanoparticles (0.2 mg/mL) were applied to freshly glow-discharged
carbon 200 mesh copper grids for 2 min and blotted with filter paper.
Samples were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 10 s and then blotted
and air-dried. Grids were imaged in a FEI Tecnai T12 transmission
electron microscope at 120 kV using a Gatan US1000 CCD camera. Using
FIJI (ImageJ) and the Analyze-Measure tool, particle diameter was
measured (n = 100). Measurements were plotted with
2 nm bin size, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated
in Excel.

Sequence Alignment
Amino acid sequences
of mi3 and
ΔN1-SpyCatcher were entered into UniProt BLAST and aligned against
all proteins in the human protein database (UniProtKB_human) with
the default settings (E-threshold: 10, matrix: auto,
filtering: none).82 The top match was aligned
and examined for expect (E)-value. E-values relate to the number of hits expected by chance when searching
a database of that size. E-values >0.1 are considered
not significant.58 A position-specific
scoring matrix based on conservation for the amino acid sequence of T. maritima KDPG aldolase was generated using PSI-BLAST
with three iterations, and representative sequences from different
bacteria are shown.83

SDS-PAGE and
Reaction Quantification
SDS-PAGE was performed
with 12 or 18% Tris-glycine gels using an XCell SureLock system (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Protein samples were loaded with 6× SDS-PAGE
loading buffer [0.23 M Tris·HCl pH 6.8, 24% (v/v) glycerol, 120
μM bromophenol blue, 0.23 M SDS] and heated for 3 min at 99
°C before loading on the gel. On reduced samples, loading buffer
contained 170 μM 2-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE was performed at
200 V in 25 mM Tris·HCl and 192 mM glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH
8.5. Gels were stained with InstantBlue Coomassie stain (Expedeon),
destained using Milli-Q water, and imaged using ChemiDoc XRS imager
and ImageLab (version 5.2) software (BioRad). ImageLab was also used
for band quantification. To assess the percentage of SpyCatcher-mi3
particle that had reacted with antigen, a sample of unreacted SpyCatcher-mi3
at the same starting concentration was run on the gel and defined
as 100% unreacted. % Conjugation was defined as 100 × [1 –
(SpyCatcher-mi3 band after antigen incubation)/ (SpyCatcher-mi3 band
in the absence of antigen)].

Temperature-Dependent Solubility
Assay
Thirty μL
SpyCatcher-mi3 at 30 μM in 25 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 8.5 was incubated at 25, 37, 55, 75, or 95 °C for 1 h and
then cooled to 4 °C for 10 min on a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad).
Following heating, aggregated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation
at 16,900 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
was run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by densitometry. The sample held
at 25 °C was defined as 100% soluble. All samples were run in
triplicate (plotted as mean ±1 s.d.). Samples were adjusted to
0.125 mg/mL, before analyzing by DLS as above.

Freeze–Thaw
Stability Assay
180 μL SpyCatcher-mi3
at 20 μM in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4 at 4
°C) with or without 1 M trehalose (Sigma-Aldrich) was analyzed
by SDS-PAGE and DLS, either at the initial time point or after 1 or
4 cycles of freeze–thaw. Each cycle of freeze–thaw consisted
of placing the sample in a thin-wall PCR tube (StarLab) for 20 min
into a −80 °C freezer, followed by 15 min in an Eppendorf
ThermoMixer C at 25 °C. Each sample was spun at 16,900 g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove aggregates, before the
supernatant was assayed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining or DLS.
The sample without freeze–thaw was defined as 100% soluble.

Lyophilization Stability Assay
A 100 μL aliquot
of SpyCatcher-mi3 particles at 10 μM in 25 mM Tris·HCl,
150 mM NaCl, pH 8.5 at 4 °C was prepared in a 100 μL thin-wall
PCR tube. Samples were snap-frozen in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30
min. A BenchTop 2K freeze-dryer (VirTis) was used for 24 h at 0.14
mbar and −72.5 °C. Lyophilized sample was reconstituted
in the same volume of Milli-Q water and centrifuged at 16,900 g for 30 min to remove any aggregates, before analysis of
the supernatant by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining or DLS. To test
reactivity of SpyCatcher-mi3 after lyophilization, 5 μM SpyCatcher-mi3
was reacted with 15 μM SpyTag-MBP for 16 h at 25 °C, before
analysis by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining.

Concentration Stability
Assay
SpyCatcher-mi3 in 25
mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.5 at 4 °C was concentrated
in a 500 μL 300 kDa MWCO Vivaspin ultrafiltration unit (Sartorius)
to a final concentration of 1090 μM. Concentrated protein sample
was then either stored at 4 °C or underwent one round of freeze–thaw
(following the procedure in the Freeze–Thaw
Stability Assay section). The samples were then centrifuged
for 30 min at 16,900 g at 4 °C, before the protein
concentration in the supernatant was measured by BCA assay on triplicate
samples.

Preparation of Immunogens
SpyCatcher-mi3 nanoparticles
(10 μM) with 3× molar excess of CyRPA-SpyTag or SpyCatcher-AP205
VLPs with 1.5× molar excess of CyRPA-SpyTag were incubated for
16–18 h at 25 °C in PBS. The reaction was then dialyzed
4 times in a 300 kDa MWCO cellulose ester dialysis tubing against
a 4000-fold excess of PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 to remove unreacted
CyRPA-SpyTag. Conjugation of CyRPA-SpyTag to SpyCatcher-mi3 or SpyCatcher-AP205
was validated by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Reducing conditions
were employed for SpyCatcher-AP205 analysis via SDS-PAGE
because of the AP205 intersubunit disulfide bonds. Endotoxin was removed
from each reaction using Triton X-114 phase separation.84 The reaction volume was transferred to 1.5 mL
endotoxin-free microcentrifuge tubes (StarLab, cat. no. E1415–1510),
and 1% (v/v) Triton X-114 was added to each sample. Samples were then
incubated on ice until all Triton X-114 was dissolved, followed by
another 5 min incubation on ice. Samples were then incubated at 37
°C for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 16,900 g at 37 °C. The supernatant was pipetted off, and the entire
procedure repeated two times. Endotoxin concentration was determined
using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For all vaccines, endotoxin level was below 1 endotoxin
unit/mL. Vaccine doses were matched to 1 μg CyRPA equivalent
for each group and diluted with sterile endotoxin-free PBS with 0.1%
(v/v) Tween-20 to a final volume of 25 μL per dose. Each vaccine
batch was prepared within 5 days of immunization and kept at 4 °C.

Immunizations
All animal experiments and procedures
were performed according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act Project License (PPL PA7D20B85) and approved by the University
of Oxford Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Age-matched female
BALB/c mice (Envigo), housed in a specific-pathogen free environment,
were immunized with equal amounts of vaccines intramuscularly into
each leg. Immunizations were performed as a prime-boost regimen (prime
on day 0, boost on day 14). The vaccines were prepared in 0.22 μm
syringe filter-sterilized endotoxin-free PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and
formulated 1:1 in the adjuvant AddaVax (InvivoGen) (25 μL/per
dose). The protein immunogen and the AddaVax adjuvant were mixed together
by pipetting. Blood samples were harvested on days 13 and 27 to obtain
sera for analysis of end point ELISA titers and on day 28 for antibody
avidity ELISA. Blood samples were left to clot overnight at 4 °C,
and sera were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes after 10
min centrifugation at 8600 g in a benchtop centrifuge.
Six mice were used for each condition.

End Point ELISA
MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
were coated overnight at 4 °C with CyRPA at 1 μg/mL in
coating buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate with 35 mM sodium bicarbonate,
pH 9.6). Plates were washed six times with PBS/T (PBS with 0.5% Tween-20)
and blocked with PBS/T with 10% skim milk for 1 h at 25 °C. Plates
were washed six times with PBS/T and incubated with duplicates of
3-fold serially diluted serum samples for 2 h at 25 °C. Following
a wash step with PBS/T, goat antimouse total IgG conjugated to alkaline
phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) (1:3,000 dilution in PBS/T) was added
to the plates, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C.
After a final wash step with PBS/T, p-nitrophenylphosphate
(Sigma-Aldrich) (1 mg/mL) diluted in 1 M diethanolamine, pH 9.8 (Thermo
Scientific) was used as a developing substrate. A405 was obtained using a SpectraMAX M3 plate reader (Molecular
322 Devices). The end point titer is defined as the x-axis intercept of the dilution curve at an absorbance value greater
than the mean A405 plus three standard
deviations for a serum sample from a naïve mouse at a serum
dilution of 1:100.

Antibody Avidity ELISA
Antibody
avidity was assessed
at day 28 using a sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) displacement ELISA. MaxiSorp
plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with CyRPA overnight
at 4 °C and blocked and washed with PBS/T as described above.
Serum samples were individually diluted to reach an A405 of approximately 1.5 and plated in duplicate. Three
of the samples from the CyRPA-SpyTag immunized group were analyzed
at their maximum reachable A405 at 0.4,
0.5, and 0.9. Following 2 h incubation at 25 °C and washing with
PBS/T, the indicated concentration of NaSCN (0–7 M) was added
to the wells. The plates were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C,
followed by washing with PBS/T, and then incubation with secondary
antibody and substrate as above. The intercept at which the molar
concentration of NaSCN had reduced the A405 to 50% for individual samples was used to give IC50.

Statistical Analysis of Immunizations
Statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0d. Comparisons were made using
a Kruskal–Wallis test. Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test
was performed for significant values. The p values
above 0.05 were reported as nonsignificant (n.s.).
