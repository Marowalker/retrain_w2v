Graphene
oxide (GO) membranes offer exceptional promise for certain
aqueous separation challenges, such as desalination. Central to unlocking
this promise and optimizing performance for a given separation is
the establishment of a detailed molecular-level understanding of how
the membrane’s composition affects its structural and transport
properties. This understanding is currently lacking, in part due to
the fact that, until recently, molecular models with a realistic distribution
of oxygen functionalities and interlayer flake structure were unavailable.
To understand the effect of composition on the properties of GO membranes,
models with water contents and oxygen contents, varying between 0%
and 40% by weight, were prepared in this work using classical molecular
dynamics simulations. The change in membrane interlayer distance distribution,
water connectivity, and water diffusivity with water and oxygen content
was quantified. Interlayer distance distribution analysis showed that
the swelling of GO membranes could be controlled by separately tuning
both the flake oxygen content and the membrane water content. Water-molecule
cluster analysis showed that a continuous and fully connected network
of water nanopores is not formed until the water content reaches ∼20%.
The diffusivity of water in the membrane was also found to strongly
depend on both the water and the oxygen content. These insights help
understand the structure and transport properties of GO membranes
with sub-nanometer interlayer distances and could be exploited to
enhance the performance of GO membranes for aqueous separation applications.
More broadly, the high-throughput in silico approach
adopted could be applied to other nanomaterials with intrinsic non-stoichiometry
and structural heterogeneity.

==== Body
Graphene
oxide (GO) flakes can
be fabricated into multilayered and semipermeable materials known
as GO membranes.1 The individual nanopores
of GO membranes are highly permeable to water but not necessarily
dissolved solutes,2,3 and this is a particularly desirable
characteristic for an aqueous separation membrane.4 To improve the efficacy of a given membrane separation,
water permeability, and water-solute selectivity should both be optimized,
but these two properties are typically negatively correlated. For
example, in the case of desalination, reducing the average interlayer
distance of GO membranes improves the rejection rate of dissolved
salts but decreases the water permeability.5,6 Central
to the challenge of optimizing the separation performance of GO membranes
is improving the understanding of the complex interplay between a
membrane’s chemical composition, interlayer structure, and
nanopore morphology.

An important feature of GO membranes is
that water readily adsorbs
into the nanopores due to the inherent hydrophilicity of the constituent
GO flakes. The interlayer distance is ∼0.7 nm in dry conditions
but increases with relative humidity, and when membranes are immersed
in liquid water, the interlayer distance swells to ∼1.3 nm.7−9 Tuning the membrane water content therefore provides a convenient
means of controlling the interlayer distance and the effective nanopore
diameter. Several non-destructive methods have been investigated for
the control of water content in GO membranes, such as physical confinement,6 solvent drying10,11 or cross-linking
with multivalent ions.12,13 A significant improvement in
salt rejection has been achieved by confining membranes within an
epoxy resin, which serves to restrict the swelling.6 This improvement is due to an increase in the ion-permeation
free-energy barrier, associated with an enhancement of ion dehydration
effects due to increasing nanoscale confinement upon the ion entering
the membrane nanopores.14

The humidity-dependent
interlayer distance of GO membranes differs
significantly between samples, and this is largely attributable to
variability in the chemical composition of the constituent GO flakes.7 The most common oxidizing methods used to prepare
GO flakes result in different total oxygen content and types of oxygen-containing
functionalities.15,16 For example, the Brodie oxidation
method17 is known to result in a lower
overall oxygen content than the more commonly employed Hummers method18 and favors the formation of conjugated epoxide
and hydroxide functionalities.15 As a result,
differences in water permeability have been observed19,20 depending on whether the flakes were oxidized using the Hummers,18 Brodie,17 or Staudenmaier21 methods. The mechanical properties of GO membranes
are also affected by changes in the degree and type of oxidation.1,22,23 The total oxygen content of GO
can also be controlled by chemical, thermal, and electrochemical reduction.5,24,25 Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
membranes are chemically distinct and more hydrophobic24,26 than their GO analogues, resulting in different transport properties,19,20 including the possibility of improved salt rejection.5,27

One task of paramount importance is the systematic and quantitative
characterization of GO membranes across the wide range of accessible
membrane water contents and flake oxygen contents. This assignment
is ideally suited to molecular simulation, which can be used for the
rapid screening of candidate materials and characterization of properties
that may be difficult to probe experimentally. In this study, the
changes in GO membrane properties (interlayer distance, water connectivity,
and water diffusivity) due to membrane composition (water content
and flake oxygen content) were systematically investigated in silico using atomistic GO membrane models and classical
MD simulations, with the ultimate aim of underpinning the design of
GO membranes with improved performance for aqueous separations.

Results
and Discussion
GO membrane models were constructed using
the multistep molecular
dynamics (MD) routine developed in our previous work.28 In their review on the computer modeling of carbon-based
porous materials, Striolo et al.(29) highlighted model structures of GO membranes as a key area
in need of improvement to better understand their properties. In particular,
they noted that often-ignored nanoscale features such as variations
in pore size and the density and distribution of oxygen-containing
groups are critical in understanding and predicting the permeability
and selectivity of this class of materials. Our approach to constructing
GO membrane models, outlined in the Methodology section, addresses this need. It also has a number of distinct advantages
over other models described in the literature that render it suitable
for the in silico design of GO membranes:(1) The GO
flake model is fully atomistic
and has oxygen-containing groups (epoxide, hydroxide, and carboxylic
acid). These functionalities randomly decorate the plane and edges
of a flake, ensuring oxygen-functionality distributions are not correlated,
capturing the inhomogeneous and non-stoichiometric nature of oxidation.15,30 An absence of oxygen functionalities in the GO nanopores will result
in a spurious determination of the effective nanopore diameter and
is known to result in significant differences in water dynamics.31

(2) GO flakes are fully flexible. Qualitative
differences have been observed in the phase behavior, structure, and
diffusivity of nanopore water in graphene channels when modeled with
rigid compared with flexible walls.32

(3) Membrane models with a
water content
of 15% by weight and oxygen content of 25% by weight have an average
interlayer distance, bulk density, pore volume, and elastic modulus
in excellent agreement with experimental studies.28

(4) The multilayered
structure is generated
by pulling and depositing GO flakes and water onto a surface from
a random initial configuration, mimicking the real fabrication process
(i.e., flow-directed self-assembly onto a filter
or support).1,3,33,34 The process distinguishes the resulting
models from the chemically similar but structurally distinct graphite
oxides, which inherit their long-range order from the parent graphite
material.

(5) The interlayer
distance is not defined a priori, unlike in numerous
other simulation studies of
GO membranes,6,14,31,35−41 but rather adopts a value, depending on membrane composition, after
preparation and equilibration of the model.

(6) The method is computationally inexpensive
(∼1000–1500 CPU hours per model, depending on the composition).
Although the computational characterization of crystalline nanoporous
materials with well-defined structures and atomic coordinates (e.g., metal–organic frameworks42 or zeolites)43 can be relatively
straightforward, it is significantly more challenging for materials
that have intrinsic non-stoichiometry and structural heterogeneity,
such as GO membranes.8,15 One challenge is that the unambiguous
specification of atomic coordinates in a GO flake is not possible.
In addition, the interlayer distance and related properties (e.g., pore size distribution) may vary considerably throughout
the membrane structure and cannot simply be calculated for a unit
cell and extrapolated to experimentally relevant length scales, as
is routinely performed for crystalline materials. The approach is
therefore amenable to generating an ensemble of models from which
the average properties and their uncertainty can be determined. The
low computational cost of this approach is principally associated
with simulating GO flake assembly in the presence of a small number
of water molecules to exfoliate GO flakes, avoiding costly simulations
of liquid water. In addition, it provides a convenient means to incorporate
water into the membrane nanopores without having to perform computationally
expensive Monte Carlo simulations, in which the membrane is in equilibrium
with a water reservoir at a fixed relative humidity.



The membrane water content, mw, and
flake oxygen content, mo, of membrane
models are expressed as weight percentages:  where mwater is
the total mass of water molecules in the membrane, nGO is the number of constituent GO flakes in the membrane
(nGO = 6 in this work), mGO is the mass of a GO flake, and moxygen is the total mass of oxygen on the flake present on
the basal plane only. The mass of oxygen atoms on the edges of the
flake are not included in the calculation of moxygen because their inclusion results in a non-representative
low surface density of oxygen on the plane at low oxygen content.
This is a finite size effect due to the increased relative contribution
of the edges compared with real GO flakes, which have a much larger
size. To separately investigate the effects of mw and mo on membrane properties
these values were varied from 0% to 40% with 5% intervals. The range
of water contents studied was chosen to reflect membranes with different
degrees of hydration, ranging from the anhydrous state to the fully
swollen state (i.e., when immersed in liquid water).
For each membrane composition (mw and mo), 10 models were constructed, from which mean
properties and uncertainties were determined. Therefore, a total of
180 GO membrane models were constructed in this study. Models with
variable mw were prepared
with a constant oxygen content (mo = 25%, C-to-O atomic ratio = 4:1). The range of oxygen contents
was chosen to reflect the typical values of GO using standard oxidation
methods (mo = 25% to 40%, C-to-O atomic
ratio between 4:1 and 2:1)15 and those
accessible by reduction to RGO (mo <
25%).26 Models with variable mo values were prepared with a constant number of water
molecules (1067), which corresponds to mw = 15% for a membrane with mo = 25%,
roughly typical for the water content of a membrane at ambient humidity.44,45

The interlayer distance of GO membranes is perhaps the most
important
property to characterize and quantify, because its value, minus the
effective flake thickness, defines the approximate diameter of the
nanopores through which mass transport occurs. Experimentally, swelling
of GO membranes is most commonly investigated by analysis of X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns, where the position of the (001) reflection
is assumed to be equal to the average interlayer distance, dGO. In this work, dGO was calculated from dGO = Lz/nGO, where Lz is the final length of the
simulation cell containing the membrane in the z dimension. Figure 1 shows the change
in dGO with water and oxygen content.

Figure 1 Average
interlayer distance, dGO, for
membranes prepared with variable membrane water content, mw, (black, circles) and flake oxygen content, m0 (red, squares). For most data points, the
error bars are smaller than the symbols. The blue labels correspond
to separate regions of the swelling profile for the variable water
content models.44

For the dry membrane (mw = 0%), dGO = 0.77 nm, but the membrane swells to dGO = 1.35 nm at the highest water content studied
(mw = 40%). Experimentally, the swelling
of GO membranes is studied by increasing the relative humidity (RH),
and two distinct regions of the swelling profile can typically be
identified. In the first region (RH = 30–75%), the degree of
swelling is modest, corresponding to an increase in dGO of ∼0.1 nm.7,46−48 In the second region, at higher humidities (RH > 75%) or when
immersed
in liquid water,46 a more significant increase
in dGO of ∼0.3 nm is observed.
Although the direct relationship between RH and dGO was not made in the present study, Korobov et al.(44) reported that a membrane
with a RH of 30% and 75% had water contents of 17% and 24%, respectively.
This correspondence between RH and water content allows us to approximately
separate the simulated swelling profile into three regions for the
convenience of the following discussion; regions A, B, and C, defined
by mw = 0% to 17%, 17%
to 24%, and 24% to 40%, respectively. In region A, which corresponds
to RH < 30%, the average interlayer distance is approximately constant
(dGO ≈ 0.80 nm). In region B, which
corresponds to 30% < RH < 75%, there is a modest increase in
average interlayer distance (dGO = 0.80
to 0.96 nm). In region C, which corresponds to RH > 75%, the average
interlayer distance increases more rapidly (dGO = 0.96 to 1.35 nm), in qualitative agreement with the experimental
literature. It is interesting to compare these observations with the
simulated results of Devanathan et al.,45 which showed an abrupt increase in the interlayer
distance, from 0.8 nm at mw = 0% to 1.1
nm at mw = 1% and then a constant interlayer
distance for all other water contents (up to mw = 23%). This discontinuous increase in interlayer distance
at low water content is inconsistent with our results and the available
experimental evidence,5,7,46−49 which show a continuous and gradual expansion of interlayer distance
upon hydration.

Region A is not reported in experiments, and
this is probably related
to the known difficulty in removing all of the water from the membrane;48 thus, membrane models with very low water content
may not have an easily realizable experimental counterpart. The changes
in interlayer distance with water content can be explained in the
context of the membranes’ bulk density. The density passes
through a maximum at a water content of 15% (Figure S2), and this is due to the inherent porosity of the membrane.
At low water content (region A), water can be added into the free
pore volume without a change in the interlayer distance, increasing
the bulk density. At higher water contents (regions B and C), the
bulk density decreases. This is because more water can only be accommodated
into the pores by increasing the interlayer distance (swelling) and
because the skeletal density of the GO framework (∼2.2 g cm–3) is much higher than the bulk density of liquid water
(1.0 g cm–3).

Figure 1 shows that
the average interlayer distance of membranes with variable oxygen
content increases linearly from dGO =
0.68 to 0.90 nm because an increase in the number of oxygen functionalities
increases the effective flake thickness. This suggests that dGO could be controlled by tuning the chemical
composition of the constituent GO flakes by oxidation and reduction
reactions. For membranes with mo = 0%, dGO is much greater than the carbon–carbon
distance between adjacent layers in graphite (0.34 nm), and this difference
is due to the presence of water and imperfect packing of flakes in
the model. Experimentally, a variation in average interlayer distance
has been reported for GO samples with different degrees and types
of oxygen functionality7 and control of
the interlayer distance by tuning oxygen content has already been
realized.5,50 Cho et al.(5) varied the oxygen content of vacuum-dried membranes using
different oxidation methods and thermal treatment. Their XRD analysis
showed that Hummers membranes, with a C-to-O ratio of 2.0 (mo = 40.0%), had an interlayer distance of 0.85
nm, and Brodie membranes, with a C-to-O ratio of 2.1 (mo = 38.9%), had a slightly lower interlayer
distance of 0.82 nm. The surface of GO flakes oxidized using the Hummers
or Brodie method is known to be dominated by hydroxide and epoxide
functionalities23 as well as some isolated
regions of aromatic carbon,51 consistent
with the structure of our flake models (Figure S1).28 The value of 0.85 nm is less
than that predicted by our models at the same oxygen content, but
an unambiguous quantitative comparison to the experiment is not possible
because the exact water content of these membranes is unknown.

Further insight into the change in interlayer structure of GO membranes
can be obtained by visualizing individual models. One set of models
with increasing membrane water content is shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2, it is clear that GO membranes have considerable
variation in interlayer distance between different regions of the
membrane as well as between a given pair of adjacent GO flakes. The
layering of GO flakes is far from ideal, which is not unexpected given
the broad XRD peaks observed experimentally.8,52,53 This heterogeneity means that simple models
of GO nanopores, defined by perfectly parallel and graphene plates
with a constant interlayer distance are structurally unrepresentative.
The variation in interlayer distance revealed by Figure 2 suggests it would be more
instructive to study the distribution of interlayer distances, P(d), rather than the averaged value, dGO, as in Figure 1. Interlayer distance distributions for membranes with
different water content and flake oxygen content are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 2 Swelling of GO membranes

carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms are shown with black, red, and
yellow spheres, respectively; the cyan surface indicates a molecular
surface generated over nanopore water molecules.

Figure 3 Distribution of interlayer distances, P(d), for GO membranes with variable (a) water content, mw, and (b) oxygen content, mo.

Figure 3a shows
how the distribution of interlayer distances changes with water content.
The dry membrane has three well-defined peaks, at d = 0.49, 1.00, and 1.51 nm, and these peaks indicate strong correlations
of GO flake pairs in direct contact, separated by one other GO flake
and separated by two other GO flakes, respectively. The position of
the first peak is much less than the average interlayer distance for
the same membrane (dGO = 0.77 nm), which
is due to the inefficient packing of flakes and the presence of voids
in the structure when prepared without water (as shown in Figure 2). The correlation
between flake positions decreases with distance leading to a reduction
in the intensity of successive P(d) peaks.

As the water content is increased, the intensity of
the first peak
decreases and shifts to slightly larger distances due to the incorporation
of water molecules into the interlayer space. At mw = 15%, a new peak becomes evident (at d = 0.72 nm), corresponding to an interlayer distance where adjacent
GO flakes are separated by a water monolayer. The peaks at 0.49 and
0.72 nm are similar in intensity at this water content, demonstrating
coexistence of dehydrated regions and monolayer water regions. At
higher water contents, the peak at 0.72 nm becomes more intense as
the number and size of monolayer water regions increases and the peak
initially at 0.49 nm eventually completely disappears (mw > 30%). At these higher water contents, all GO flakes
are separated by at least one water layer, and regions in which flakes
are in direct contact with each other are no longer observed. At the
highest water content, three well-defined peaks in P(d) can be identified (at d = 0.73,
1.38, and 2.11 nm), corresponding to regions in which GO flakes are
separated by a monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer of water, respectively.
The value of dGO for this membrane is
1.35 nm (Figure 1),
which is very close to the position of the bilayer peak. Despite this,
many monolayer and trilayer water regions are also present at this
water content, and this heterogeneity will have important implications
for understanding the permeability of GO membranes in the very swollen
state.

It is helpful to validate these swelling observations
by discussion
of the available experimental evidence. Lerf et al.(7) investigated the in situ hydration of graphite oxide using XRD analysis. They observed a
single (001) peak in the XRD pattern for an anhydrous sample. Within
the first hour of exposure to 100% RH conditions, they observed the
gradual disappearance of this peak and appearance of a second peak
in the XRD pattern, and these two peaks coexist at certain intermediate
times. The coexistence of two distinct interlayer distances upon hydration
can be attributed to interstratification (i.e., randomly
packed hydration states throughout the interlayer space of the membrane).46 Finally, at longer time scales, they observed
a continuous shift of the second reflection in the XRD pattern to
larger distances, as well as a broadening of the peak, corresponding
to an increase in the number of different interlayer distances. Scanning
from left to right in Figure 3a can therefore be interpreted as equivalent to the time-dependent
swelling of GO membranes in the study by Lerf.7 Similar observations were made in a separate study.48 In support of this finding, scanning force microscopy imaging
of bilayer GO showed that, up to RH = 80%, the interlayer space gradually
increases by incorporation of immobile patches of water less than
10 nm in size46 and not by a sudden, discontinuous
incorporation of well-defined integer layers of water throughout the
entire membrane. Furthermore, AFM analysis54 of a GO membrane sample with an average interlayer distance 0.78
nm showed a trimodal interlayer distance distribution, which was reproduced
by fitting to 3 Gaussian functions, centered at 0.48, 0.76, and 1.11
nm. This compares well with the peak positions in P(d) for the mw = 15%
model, which has a similar average interlayer distance (0.80 nm),
and P(d) peaks positioned at 0.52,
0.72, and 1.08 nm.

Figure 3b shows
the change in P(d) for models with
increasing oxygen content. For mo = 0%,
the distribution consists of a series of well-defined intense peaks,
the first 3 of which are positioned at 0.37, 0.75, and 1.14 nm. The
position of the first peak and distance between this and subsequent
peaks are close to the interlayer distance of graphite because there
are no oxygen functionalities on the plane of the flake in this model.
The absence of a peak associated with a water monolayer implies that
the water does not reside in the interlayer space in these membranes.
Water instead accumulates at the hydrophilic flake edges, which are
functionalized with carboxylic acid groups rather than the hydrophobic
planes. This effect can be visualized in Figure 4 and is supported by an analysis of water
molecule coordination numbers (Figure S6), which show a decrease in the water–water and water–carboxylic
acid coordination numbers with oxygen content, associated with water
being increasingly present in the interlayer space, instead of at
the flake edges. This effect also explains the presence of some larger
nanopores shown in the pore size distributions for membranes with
very low oxygen content (Figure S4).

Figure 4 GO membranes
with variable flake oxygen contents. GO flake carbon,
oxygen, and hydrogen atoms are shown in black, red, and yellow, respectively;
the cyan surface indicates a molecular surface generated from nanopore
water.

As mo is increased, the intensity of
the first peak decreases and gradually shifts to larger distances.
At intermediate oxygen contents the structure is poorly defined beyond
the first peak, indicating poor correlations between GO flake interlayer
distances. At high oxygen content (mo =
40%), the peak positions again become well-defined, with distinct
peaks at 0.63, 1.23, and 1.80 nm. This can be explained in terms of
flake surface roughness. At intermediate oxygen contents, there are
regions of the flake that are highly functionalized as well as regions
with no oxygen-functionalities producing a GO flake with a rough surface.
At high oxygen contents (C-to-O ratio = 2.0), most carbon atoms are
either functionalized themselves or adjacent to at least one functionalized
carbon. As a result, the flake has a more consistent thickness and
its roughness decreases.

In an aqueous separation experiment,
the ability of a solute to
pass through the membrane will depend on the connectivity of the water
in the nanopores. The connectivity of water was assessed using a recursive
algorithm by identifying distinct clusters of water in the membrane
models based on a simple distance criterion. A pair of water molecules
were defined as being as in the same cluster if the distance between
their water oxygen atoms was less than a specified cutoff distance
or if they could be connected to each other via intermediary
water molecules within that same cutoff. The cutoff (0.36 nm) was
defined as the position of the first minimum in the O–O pair
distribution function (Figure S5), obtained
from a separate simulation of bulk water. For each model, the cluster
with the largest number of water molecules was identified and expressed
as a fraction, fw, of the total number
of water molecules in the membrane model. Thus, fw = 1 indicates that all water molecules in the membrane
are in the same cluster and the membrane water is fully connected,
and fw ≈ 0 means that all water
molecules are isolated or in very small clusters and the membrane
has poor connectivity. Figure 5 shows the change in fw with membrane
water content and flake oxygen content.

Figure 5 Fraction of water molecules
in the largest cluster for membranes
with variable water content (black) and flake oxygen content (red).
The clusters shown in panels i–iv are example images of the
largest water cluster found for the water contents labeled on the
main figure.

The increase in fw with water content
suggests water connectivity significant improves upon swelling and
hydration of the membrane. At high water content (mw > 20%) the water nanopores are fully connected (fw ≈ 1.0). However, at lower water content
(mw < 20%) the connectivity of water
decreases (fw = 0.64, 0.27, and 0.07 for mw = 15, 10, and 5%, respectively). Therefore,
a sharp cutoff in connectivity is apparent at intermediate water content
(mw = 20%), above which all of the water
in the membrane is connected and below, which it is not. At low water
content, the identity of the largest water cluster does not typically
change over the course of the 10 ns simulation, suggesting that the
water molecules and clusters themselves are relatively immobile. For
each model, the largest water cluster can be visually inspected along
the profile of fw, with examples shown
in Figure 5i–iv,
demonstrating the improving connectivity of the nanopores with water
content. Figure 6 shows
all of the clusters containing more than 10 water molecules for a
membrane model with mw = 10%.

Figure 6 Water clusters,
colored separately, for all clusters containing
more than 10 water molecules for a model with a water content of 10%.
The water molecules not shown are either isolated or present in clusters
smaller than 10 molecules.

Figure 5 also
shows
that the connectivity of water in the membrane is sensitive to flake
oxygen content. For mo = 0%, fw = 0.98, indicating that the water in the membrane is
almost fully connected. The connectivity decreases to fw = 0.5–0.7 at high oxygen content. Given that
the number of water molecules is constant across this range, the improved
connectivity at low mo is due to the change
in distribution of water molecules throughout the membrane, i.e., the preference of water to reside at the flake edges
rather than in the interlayer space (Figure 4). This suggests that both the total oxygen
content and the distribution of oxygen functionalities (e.g., plane or edges) could be exploited to control the connectivity
of water and morphology of nanopores.

The effect of membrane
water content and flake oxygen content on
the self-diffusion coefficient of water, Dw, was investigated (Figure 7). In general, the results show that the diffusion of water
in GO membranes is significantly lower (Dw < 1.8 × 10–5 cm2 s–1) than bulk water (Dw = 5.6 × 10–5 cm2 s–1 for the TIP3P
model), contradicting some experimental interpretations2,55 but in agreement with other molecular simulation studies in the
literature.35,40,47,49 The lower value of Dw can be attributed to confinement effects and the hydrophilic
nature of GO, which results in strong hydrogen-bonding interactions
between nanopore water molecules and the oxygen functionalities of
GO flakes.48,56,57Dw increases with water content, from
0.1 × 10–5 cm2 s–1 for mw = 5% to 1.8 × 10–5 cm2 s–1 for mw = 40%. The improvement in Dw is
slow initially (mw < 15%) but becomes
increasingly rapid at higher water contents. This is because at low
water content additional water molecules adsorb to available oxygen
functionalities of the GO flakes. The number of occupied functionalities
increases with water content, and once it reaches a critical value,
all of the binding sites in the GO framework are occupied. Additional
water molecules must then occupy sites less strongly bound to the
surface that are in a more bulk-like water environment. This interpretation
is supported by experimental evidence from neutron scattering48 and broadband dielectric spectroscopy58 studies of hydrated graphite oxide. These studies
showed that the rotational and translational motion of water at low
water content is severely restricted, but at higher water contents,
motions due to bulk-like water are observed (i.e., associated with translational motion through the membrane). The
water content at which the latter motions were first observed in these
studies was mw = 15% to 17%, approximately
equal to the water content at which Dw begins to rapidly increase in our models (Figure 7). It is also notable that this is the water
content at which the network of water in the membrane nanopores becomes
fully connected (Figure 5).

Figure 7 Water self-diffusion coefficient, Dw,
for membranes with variable mw (black,
circles) and mo (red, squares). For most
data points, the error bars are smaller than the symbols.

Following from the explanation that slow water
dynamics is due
to strong interactions between water and the GO oxygen- unctionalities,
it follows to expect a decrease in Dw with
flake oxygen content at constant membrane water content. From Figure 7, it can be seen
that this is initially the case, where Dw decreases from 0.77 × 10–5 cm2 s–1 at mo = 0% to
0.15 × 10–5 cm2 s–1 at mo = 15%. Surprisingly, beyond mo = 20%, the diffusion coefficient starts to
increases with oxygen content. This can be explained by the ratio
of the number of oxygen atoms in water to the number of oxygen atoms
in GO (noGO/now) and by the location of the oxygen functionalities.
At mo = 0%, noGO/now < 1,
water is predominantly found at the flake edges rather than the interlayer
space, which does not contain any oxygen functionalities and is therefore
more hydrophobic. This leads to the formation of larger clusters with
bulk-like water molecules (Figure 4a). As the oxygen content is increased and basal plane
becomes more hydrophilic, more of the water molecules become strongly
bound to oxygen-functionalities in the interlayer space, and Dw decreases. At intermediate oxygen contents
(mo = 15% to 20%), noGO/now ≈
1, meaning that each water molecule can be bound to an oxygen-functionality
with few unoccupied binding sites (Figure 4b). At higher oxygen contents (mo > 20%), noGO/now > 1, meaning that
every water
molecule can be bound to an oxygen-functionality, but there are additional
unoccupied binding sites that facilitate the motion of water molecules
throughout the membrane nanopores, leading to an increase in Dw. The models prepared provide a basis for the
study of the transport properties of GO membranes using simulations,
including the quantification of water and solute permeability. This
could be investigated using non-equilibrium MD35 or the kinetic MC approach recently proposed by Apostololou et al.(59)

Finally, the in-plane
elastic modulus, E, of each
membrane model was calculated (Figure 8). Large uncertainties were observed in the calculation
of E due to significant variations between models
with the same composition. Despite this, at low water content (mw ≤ 15%), the value of E is within the wide range reported experimentally (E = 15–42 GPa),1 and a statistically
significant decrease in E was observed for higher
water contents (mw ≥ 20%). The
modulus decreases at the same water content that the water network
becomes fully connected (Figure 5) and is therefore likely to be related to the formation
of distinct layers of water (Figure 3). A coarser modeling approach, such as that used to
study the poromechanics of multilayered clay materials, is required
to investigate other mechanical propeties.60

Conclusions
Understanding
the relationship between membrane composition and
structure is critical for optimizing the performance of a given membrane
separation. For example, understanding how the interlayer distance,
nanopore connectivity, and water diffusivity in GO membranes change
with relative humidity must be understood to underpin the design of
membranes with optimized water flux and salt rejection.6 The key findings from this work, relevant to
the design and optimization of GO membranes for aqueous separations,
can be summarized as follows:(1) GO membranes have a distribution of
interlayer distances that is dependent on the membrane water content.
For a water content of 15% (dGO = 0.80
nm), the membrane water is predominantly found in monolayers, but
dehydrated regions are also observed. For a water content of 40% (dGO = 1.35 nm), dehydrated regions no longer
exist and water monolayers, bilayers, and trilayers coexist.

(2) There is a sharp cutoff
in nanopore
water connectivity at a water content of 20%, below which there are
a number of separate water clusters, suggesting that the permeation
of solutes in membranes with water contents less than this cutoff
may be significantly hindered.

(3) Water self-diffusion coefficients
range from 0.1 × 10–5 to 1.8 × 10–5 cm2 s–1 depending on
the water content, but diffusion is always slow relative to bulk solution.

(4) All of the properties
investigated
were found to depend on the oxygen content of the constituent GO flakes,
suggesting that separation performance could also be enhanced by optimizing
oxygen content, which could be achieved by oxidation or reduction
reactions.



Although the direct link between
relative humidity and the resulting
membrane structure was not made in this study for reasons of computational
expediency, this relationship could be established using molecular
simulations with a constant imposed water chemical potential. However,
because water uptake into the membrane induces significant swelling,
the volume of the simulation cell must be allowed to change, so adsorption
simulations in a rigid GO framework using the traditional Grand Canonical
Monte Carlo (GCMC) approach would be unsuitable. Possible alternative
approaches for investigating adsorption-induced structural transitions
in flexible adsorbent materials include simulations in the constant
pressure Gibbs ensemble,61,62 osmotic ensemble63,64 or performing GCMC adsorption simulations coupled with isothermal−isobaric
(NPT) MD relaxation cycles.65

The
intrinsic heterogeneity
of the membrane structure highlights
the importance of flexible GO flakes in understanding the swelling
of GO membranes. Over-simplified models (e.g., in
which GO nanopores modeled as rigid, pristine graphitic plates) would
not allow the efficient packing of GO flakes (apart from at very low
oxygen content, where the flake surface is very smooth), reproduce
the gradual swelling with increased water content, or reproduce the
coexistence of hydrated and nonhydrated regions between a given pair
of flakes at intermediate water content. Therefore, our GO membrane
models can be considered a significant improvement upon those previously
published, addressing a recently highlighted key research need.29 Furthermore, the high-throughput and in silico approach adopted and presented in this study is
broadly applicable to other layered or porous materials with intrinsic
nonstoichiometry and structural heterogeneity and provides a general
strategy for their design and optimization.

Methodology
A
full description of the procedure and justification for the models
of GO flakes is provided in our previous work.28 In brief, a pristine graphene flake was converted to GO
by adding oxygen-containing functionalities until the specified target
oxygen content was reached. The size of the flake, 5 nm2, was chosen on the basis on our previous study, which demonstrated
that finite size effects were not significant for flakes with an area
larger than this.28 Flake edges were terminated
with hydrogen or carboxylic acid functionalities (selected randomly
with equal probability) and the flake plane functionalized with hydroxide
or epoxide groups (selected randomly with equal probability), justified
by experimental observations.23,30 The random approach
to functionalization ensures that GO flake models with the same composition
have a different molecular-level distribution of functionalities (Figure S1). Apart from extremely high or low
oxygen content, this procedure leads to an amorphous surface, in general,
with some small nanocrystalline regions of pristine (aromatic) graphene,
which is supported by experimental evidence.51,66,67 While there is some debate around the size
of these regions, experimental evidence shows that the majority of
the GO flake surface is oxidized or amorphous. This property is reproduced
by our models. The procedure used to functionalize the flakes was
the same irrespective of the oxygen content, and the specific types
and distributions of oxygen functionalities were not modified to reflect
the distinct surface chemistry of RGO for low oxygen content.24,26

Each GO membrane model was constructed according to the following
procedure. A total of six GO flakes were randomly distributed, along
with water, in a simulation cell with side lengths of Lx = 5 nm, Ly = 5 nm, and Lz = 50 nm, with a structure-less wall placed at Lz = 0. Interactions between the membrane
atoms and the wall were modeled using Lennard-Jones 12–6 potential
(σ = 0.355 nm, ε = 0.293 kJ mol–1).
The centers of mass of the GO flakes and water molecules were slowly
pulled toward the base of the simulation cell during a 2.5 ns NVT
simulation, at a rate of 10–3 nm ps–1, using a harmonic potential with a force constant of 103 kJ mol–1 nm–2, whereupon the
GO layers deposited on the wall. Following this simulation, the wall
was removed and a 10 ns anisotropic NPzzT simulation was performed to remove remaining vacuum
gap, resulting in a periodic membrane structure in 3D. A further 10.1
ns isotropic NPT simulation was performed, from which the time-averaged
interlayer distance distribution, water connectivity and water diffusion
coefficient were determined from the final 10 ns, using atomic coordinates
collected every 200, 100, and 20 ps, respectively. Diffusion coefficients
were obtained using the Einstein relation, from the gradient of a
plot of mean-squared displacement against time at short time scales
(between 5 and 25 ps). Pore size distributions were determined from
the final configuration after removing membrane water molecules using
the Poreblazer software.68 In-plane tensile
moduli, E, were calculated from a straight line fit
to the stress–strain relationship in the elastic region (<0.5%
strain), obtained from additional 10 ns simulations in which the simulation
cell is gradually extended in the x direction at
increments of 1.0 × 10–5 nm every 1 ps. In
these simulations, the cell lengths in the y and z directions are allowed to relax in response to the deformation.

All MD simulations were performed using GROMACS, version 2016.3.69 GO and water were modeled using the CHARMM70 and TIP3P71 force
fields, respectively. van der Waals interactions were modeled using
a LJ 12–6 potential that was smoothly cut off between 1.0 and
1.2 nm and parameters for atoms that were not alike were obtained
using the Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules. Equations of motion
were integrated using the leapfrog method72 using a time step of 1 fs, and TIP3P water molecules were constrained
using the SETTLE algorithm.73 Electrostatic
interactions were evaluated to within a tolerance of 10–5 kJ mol–1 using the PME approach74,75 with a real-space cut-off of 1.2 nm. A target temperature of 298
K was maintained using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat76,77 with a coupling time constant of 1 fs. In the constant pressure
simulations, a target pressure of 1 bar was maintained using the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat,78 with a time constant of 1 fs
and a compressibility of 4.5 × 10–5 bar–1.
