The
interesting magnetic response of conventional ferro-colloid
has proved extremely useful in a wide range of technical applications.
Furthermore, the use of nano/micro- sized magnetic particles has proliferated
cutting-edge medical research, such as drug targeting and hyperthermia.
In order to diversify and improve the application of such systems,
new avenues of functionality must be explored. Current efforts focus
on incorporating directional interactions that are surplus to the
intrinsic magnetic one. This additional directionality can be conveniently
introduced by considering systems composed of magnetic particles of
different shapes. Here we present a combined analytical and simulation
study of permanently magnetized dipolar superball particles; a geometry
that closely resembles magnetic cubes synthesized in experiments.
We have focused on determining the initial magnetic susceptibility
of these particles in dilute suspensions, seeking to quantify the
effect of the superball shape parameter on the system response. In
turn, we linked the computed susceptibilities to the system microstructure
by analyzing cluster composition using a connectivity network analysis.
Our study has shown that by increasing the shape parameter of these
superball particles, one can alter the outcome of self-assembly processes,
leading to the observation of an unanticipated decrease in the initial
static magnetic susceptibility.

==== Body
It is often
the case that the
significance of a newly realized material directly impinges on the
range of capabilities it has. This statement simply comes down to
a question of whether or not a certain degree of versatility is present.
The ability to perform multiple tasks is crucial; simultaneous execution
is certainly the pinnacle of such a goal, however it is often sufficient
to simply switch between states that perform or behave differently.
A quintessential example thereof is the ferro-colloid.1 This magnetic liquid—a stable colloidal suspension
of magnetic nanoparticles in a carrier liquid—represents a
switchable system, regulated with the application of a magnetic field.2 In addition, the capability to tune the exact
state of the ferro-colloid through precise control of the applied
magnetic field strength has only increased its utility.3,4 The constituent magnetic particles, most commonly composed of some
iron oxide variant, are undoubtedly the critical component characterizing
the response of the fluid.

With this in mind, it is useful to
make the link to a topic of
significant current interest within colloidal science as a whole;
specifically, the notion of short-range directional interactions that
manifest in systems comprised of “shape-anisotropic”
particles.5,6 Of particular interest for us here is the
distinctive phenomena arising in systems of magnetic particles that
are themselves nonspherical.7,8 The idea being that
the nonspherically symmetric short-range interaction will be intrinsically
coupled to the anisotropic magnetic interaction; in a sense, this
scenario can be viewed as a competition between two sources of directionality.
This competition will directly impact on the self-assembly mechanisms
at play within the material.9

Given
this fact, it is no surprise that a significant body of work
on the realization of experimental magnetic particle systems of this
type has occurred. These systems can generally be grouped into two
distinct classes. Classification one: spherical symmetry of the particle
geometry is typically retained, where some modification or symmetry
breaking of the magnetic interaction is introduced; archetypical examples
include Janus, capped, and patched colloids.10−15 Classification two: particle geometry is the principal modification,
and changes in the magnetic character are solely a consequence of
this alteration; a wide variety of particle shapes have materialized,
including cubes, rods, peanuts, and ellipsoids, to name but a few.16−21 However, it is often the case that features of both appear in a
single particle type, i.e., Janus
magnetic rods and colloidal dumbbells with magnetic belts.22,23

The work presented here is concerned with the second of these
three
particle varieties, with our attention focused exclusively on cubic
particles. Although we are only considering one particle type, an
interesting additional consideration arises. Namely, the synthesis
of colloidal magnetic cubes typically results in particles that are
anything but perfectly cubic.24 The curvature
of the particles’ edges and vertices has a direct impact on
the resulting behavior.25 It follows that
one has to explicitly account for this phenomenon when looking to
accurately model these particles. Thankfully, a geometrical definition
exists that has been shown to account for the particle shapes observed.
This classification is termed a superball; the surface of which can
be defined in a particle centered frame of reference as follows 1  The exact structure of a superball is determined
by the value of the shape parameter q. Superballs
with shape parameters lying in the domain q ∈
[1,∞] interpolate smoothly from a sphere (q = 1) to a perfect cube (q → ∞). The
quantity h defines, independently of q, the size of the superball’s principal axes (particle height).

In recent years, a great deal about the behavior of superball particles
has been elucidated. Numerical investigations that explored purely
the effect of particle shape (nonmagnetic hard particles) highlighted
interesting phase behavior.26,27 Moreover, it should
come as no surprise that predicting the influence of the shape parameter
on the packing of these particles was among the first investigations
to be conducted.28 Experimental studies
have not only addressed the crystal formation of superballs but also
the rheological properties.29−31 Predictions relating to the electrostatic
and hydrodynamic characteristics of superball suspensions have also
been reported.32 The crystallization of
magnetic superballs has also been investigated, with the caveat that
the crystals were formed by sedimentation.33 Furthermore, recent numerical studies on fluids of cube-like magnetic
particles under the influence of an external field have begun to shed
light on the implications of the particle shape on the aggregation
present.34,35

One important aspect that has not
been addressed to date in any
detail is the explicit variation in magnetic response one would expect
from spheres to cubes. Having noticed this omission, we chose to consider
the following assertion: If we assume a superball ferro-colloid could
be stabilized, then what would the differences in magnetic response
be between it and a traditional ferro-colloid composed of spherical
particles. The response of a magnetic material can be characterized
by measuring the magnetization curve M(H): the variation of the magnitude of the magnetization M = |M|, as a function of the magnetic field strength H = |H|. In particular, the initial static
magnetic susceptibility (ISMS) is a characteristic property of ferro-colloid;
it is a measure of the magnetization curve within the linear response
regime (i.e., small fields), χ0 = dM/dH|H=0. Furthermore, the ISMS of magnetic fluids is a concept that
is well studied not only from the point of view of experiment and
theory but also computer simulation.36 As
such, it was useful to analyze this quantity for magnetic superball
fluids to facilitate a meaningful comparison.

There are a number
of theories that have been devised over the
years that attempt to connect the macroscopic magnetic response of
ferro-colloids and the interparticle interactions of the constituent
particles. Langevin’s model of ideal (non-interacting) particles
was the genesis of these efforts, where the ISMS for this ideal paramagnetic
gas reads in terms of the number density of particles (ρ) as
χl = 4πρλ/3.37 This expression introduces an important quantity,
the magnetic coupling parameter λ: 2  that is, the energy
per particle of two collinear
dipoles (m = |m|), at close contact
(h) relative to thermal energy, kT. This is the only parameter needed to systematically vary the strength
of the magnetic interaction. The primary concern over the next century
was how best to account for the interactions between the magnetic
nanoparticles that Langevin had neglected. This question becomes even
more pertinent with increasing λ. A selection of the most relevant
attempts are summarized concisely by Kantorovich et al. and the references therein.37

Arguably the most successful of these theories to date is the so-called
modified mean-field theory (MMFT); detailed comparisons between experimental
data and simulation results, for not only monodisperse but also polydisperse
systems, have confirmed its validity over the widest range of temperature
and concentration.37−39 The success of MMFT can perhaps be best described
through its physical interpretation. MMFT provides a framework to
account for the effective field acting on a particular particle; the
effective field depends not only on the applied external field but
also on all of the other magnetic particles in the system. The expression
for the ISMS found following a rigorous derivation from first-principles
reads as follows: 3  it being a second-order correction
to the
model proposed by Langevin.39 The initial
statement of MMFT for the ISMS up to first order actually came about
as an empirical modification to the Weiss model.37,38 Subsequent developments of MMFT incorporated the important effects
of chain formation into this framework.40 It follows that MMFT, including chain formation, is a prime candidate
to apply to fluids of magnetic superballs, albeit with a few adaptive
modifications.

In order to address the lack of insight in this
area, we present
here numerical investigations exploring the magnetic response of relatively
low-density fluids of magnetic superballs. The field produced by a
magnetic superball was modeled using a single dipole placed at the
particle’s center of mass and oriented in the [001] crystallographic
direction. The study of colloidal magnetic suspensions often focuses
on tailoring the system’s magnetic response. This procedure
can involve targeting particular behavior under certain physical conditions
or, as the case here, attempting to realize systems that react stronger
to an external magnetic field. Cube-like particles were considered
possible contenders for the realization of such an aim, a conjecture
that was based on results from previous work which reported that the
preference for magnetically “reactive” chain aggregates
in the ground state of superball particles increases with growing q.25,41 In other words, the nonzero dipole
moment of the observed chain structures could, in principle, lead
to a more field-susceptible system. Furthermore, there is a real prospect
that the documented closing transition for spherical particles into
ring aggregates, which induces a abrupt decrease in ISMS with reducing
temperature, has the possibility of not occurring for cubic particles.42 It transpires that the thermal stability of
the structural motifs known to constitute the ground state of superball
particles is a key consideration at finite temperature, an effect
which we quantify in this work.25 The crux
of our investigation became the following: How do modest increases
in the value of the superball shape parameter (q =
1.0, 1.25, 1.50) impact the resulting ISMS of the corresponding magnetic
suspensions?

We have also sought to adapt MMFT, with the aim
of accounting for
the specific shape parameter of the superballs in question. Moreover,
we have studied the microstructure of each suspension via an analysis of the cluster composition, allowing us to reconcile
the effect of cluster formation on the calculated macroscopic magnetic
response. Even though the use of the magnetic dipole–dipole
potential to characterize the long-range interactions of nanocubes
seems rather bold, it can still be considered valid for either single
domain magnetic spheres embedded within nonmagnetic cubic shells20 or can be regarded as the leading term for explicitly
cubic nanocolloids with remanent magnetization.43

It is important to acknowledge at this point that
particle polydispersity
can have a sizable effect on the magnetic response of dipolar systems,
a fact that is exacerbated in this case as there are two sources of
polydispersity: size and shape. Due to the significant complications
arising in the multicomponent system that would be required to model
these effects, we have limited our study to a strictly monodisperse
regime. Nevertheless, it is known from studies of polydisperse dipolar
hard spheres that a poisoning effect occurs, which inhibits cluster
formation and thus magnetic response; the same scenario would likely
manifest itself in this case.44 The effect
of shape polydispersity, on the other hand, is somewhat harder to
predict. What is clear, however, is that the magnetic response of
these systems will strongly depend on the exact distribution function
characterizing the variation in q.

The results
of our studies are found in the subsequent section.
We present the simulation results relating to the ISMS of the suspensions,
including a direct comparison to the predictions of an adapted MMFT.
Appearing alongside is a description of the cluster analysis algorithm
and the resulting cluster distributions. We conclude our discussion
of this work with a summary of our findings, highlighting the particular
significance the results could have for an experimentally realized
version of our system. The model and methods we have used are surmised
at the end of our contribution, where the important features of the
established particle model and simulation technique used are detailed,
accompanied by comments on the alterations required to adapt these
to calculations of bulk properties.

Results and Discussion
Initial
Static Magnetic Susceptibility
The correlations
between dipolar particles are particularly important for theoretical
considerations relating to any kind of measure of magnetic response.
Moreover, the observation of chain formation in both experiment and
simulation emphasizes the need to account for aggregation in the system.36,45 Increases in the ISMS observed are a direct result of the highly
correlated particles found in chain aggregates. Mendelev and Ivanov
extended the formulation of MMFT to account in part for the formation
of chains.40 The expression for the resulting
ISMS was formulated as 4  by introducing parameters describing both
a measure of the probability of bonding p and two-particle
correlations K. The first-order variant of eq 3 is the prefactor of the
chain forming ratio. The derivation of MMFT assumes the magnetic particles
to be spherical.

To account for the explicit shape of superball
particles, we have devised a simple manipulation to this expression.
Namely, we proposed that the bonding probability, p(q), must be dependent on the value of the shape
parameter. Within the established scheme, the bonding probability
arises as the Lagrange multiplier required for the minimization of
the system free energy density in the presence of a mass balance condition.37 Its functional form depends on the system volume
fraction φ(q) and the two-particle (dimer)
partition function , which consequently are now both shape parameter dependent: 5  The system
volume fraction is expressed in
familiar terms for superballs as follows: 6  where N is the number particles
and V the system volume, νsb(q) is the dimensionless single particle superball volume,
and Γ(x) is the gamma function of argument x. For the dimer partition function we use the following
expression: 7  The dimer partition function for spheres  is equivalent to that given in ref (40). The numerical factor f(q) appearing is the result of a linear
interpolation from spheres to cubes in terms of particle volume. In
contrast, we retain the q-independent definition
of the correlation coefficient from ref (40): 8  For
those interested in the details of our
modification please consult the Supporting Information.

Within the theoretical framework, we have just outlined that
the
key particle-shape-dependent quantity is of course the dimer partition
function. As such, it is useful to visualize its behavior and note
the differences resulting from changes in the value of q. To this end, the dimer partition functions for the q values under consideration are found in the upper plot of Figure 1. In addition, the
corresponding bonding probabilities appear underneath and are plotted
for systems with a reduced number density of ρ* = 0.075, illustrating
the effect of q on a more physical variable. Due
to the modest perturbations from sphericity considered here, we have
chosen to show one further shape parameter (q = 5.00)
simply for illustrative purposes. One can see that the overall trend
is for  to increase in line with increasing
λ. Importantly, however, one also notices that as q is increased, the number of accessible states drops ( decreases) for all values of the
magnetic coupling parameter. Turning to the bonding probability, we
observe the same pattern; p increases with increasing
λ, but falls when q is increased for fixed
λ. The expected convergence of p to unity is
observed with increasing λ and for each value of q. The function  and
in turn p directly determine the influence of chain
aggregation in the calculation of the ISMS. Already, the variation
of p and  as a function of shape parameter predicts and in fact induces a
fall in ISMS.

dimer partition
function  (upper plot)
and bonding probability p(q) (lower
plot). The curves are shown for the shape parameters under investigation, q = 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, in addition to the illustrative supplementary
value of q = 5.00. The coloring of the curves follows
the color bar appearing at the top of the figure. Please note that
a log scale has been used on the ordinate axis.

From the perspective of our simulations, we compute numerically
the ISMS on the basis of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem.
We have used the following fluctuation formula: 9  The reduced number density of particles in
the system is given by ρ* = ρh3, and the instantaneous magnetization of all dipole moments is determined
accordingly, M = ∑i = 1Nmi. The upmost care
must be taken in the computation of the magnetic fluctuations required
in eq 9. The dynamics
of dipolar systems, especially for strongly interacting particles
(high λ and/or high ρ*), can be extremely slow. Thus,
simulations typically ran for significant periods, enabling the relaxation
of the system and the equilibration of these fluctuations. The length
of this “significant period” was determined on a case
by case basis, whereby we ensured that the residual magnetization
|M| in the system becomes negligible within the limits
of statistical accuracy.

The parameter space of our investigation
was based on the following
considerations. First, we were most interested in what effect small
perturbations from spherical particle geometry would have. That is
why we only considered relatively small increases in the shape parameter,
specifically q = (1.25, 1.50). Furthermore, in the
interest of an effective comparison, we performed the same set of
simulations for spheres (q = 1.00). Second, as previously
stated, we have considered these magnetic superball suspensions in
a low-density regime with ρ* = (0.01–0.1) in increments
of 0.025; in addition, a pair of higher values ρ* = (0.15, 0.2)
were also considered, to ascertain the effect of higher concentrations.
Finally, magnetic coupling parameters, ranging λ = 1–5
in increments of 1, were considered in order to navigate a large spectrum
of self-assembly scenarios: from negligible via transient
to significant system aggregation. The full details of the model and
methods we have used in our simulations can be found in the Model and Methods section.

To begin, it is
beneficial to look at the variation in ISMS as
a function of our three basic state variables (q,
ρ*, λ). However, according to the superball definition,
the particle height h remains constant when changing q, yet the volume of a single particle does not. Therefore,
after some consideration it makes sense to map the data from number
density to volume fraction, in order to affect a more meaningful comparison.
The mapping is a simple change of variable according to eq 6. This conversion allows us to collate
all the data into a single detailed plot of χ0vs φ that appears in the main portion of Figure 2. The points represent
data from simulation, and the curves are the theoretical predictions
of our slightly modified version of the chain formation variant from eq 4. The legend at the top
of Figure 2 shows the
allocations of the line and symbol types for each q. The color coding of both the data points and curves relates to
the value of the magnetic coupling parameter, according to the color
bar shown. A logarithmic scale has been used on the ordinate axis
to facilitate a clearer distinction between the data points and curves
shown. The error bars appearing are a measure of the standard deviation
of the mean (please see the Model and Methods section).

Figure 2 Plot of χ0vs φ. Symbols
indicate data attained from simulations, and lines denote the theoretical
predictions. The line and symbol identifications obey the legend appearing
at the top of the figure. The color code relates to the value of the
magnetic coupling parameter, according to the color bar at the top
of the figure. The error bars shown denote the standard deviation
of the mean. Inset: plot of Δχ0vs ρ*. Symbols and coloring are as described for the main plot,
however the lines appearing in the inset are purely to aid the eye.
The error bars shown have been propagated from the corresponding errors
in the main plot.

The general trend observed
for each q was of increasing
χ0 with growing λ for fixed φ, as to
be expected. The most striking feature of this plot is the observed
decrease in χ0, for fixed λ, as q is increased; an observation evident for all values of λ.
In terms of the theoretical expression, it performs exceptionally
well in the low coupling regime (λ ∼ 1, 2) even to the
highest φ considered. One also notices as we move to the higher
coupling regime (λ ∼ 3, 4), the agreement is still very
good for each value of q, albeit for the deviations
that begin to occur as φ reaches its highest values; interestingly,
however, the accuracy improves as the superballs become more cubic.
For the highest coupling λ = 5, a significant difference between
the simulated and calculated data develops (except for the lowest
φ), which is in line with the assumptions/limitations of the
chain formation model in general.

To further access the differences
in static response that result
from increasingly cubic particle structure, we have considered the
following measure: 10  the difference between the ISMS of
spheres
and cubic particles, q = (1.25, 1.50). This measure
is only illustrative at the higher values of λ considered, once
the geometry of the particle begins to properly influence the self-assembly
that occurs. With this in mind, we have plotted Δχ0(q) for λ = (3–5) in the inset
of Figure 2; the functions
are plotted in terms of reduced density to allow the differences to
be calculated in the first place. The plot exemplifies the changes
in system response that arise due to the variations in particle geometry;
changes, which are exacerbated at higher values of λ, especially
in the lower half of the density range. Another point of interest
that this measure raises is the possibility of a regime change in
the evolution of the ISMS as ρ* or φ increases. Namely,
one can see for λ = (4, 5) in particular, we have a clear maximum
in Δχ0. This suggests that after a certain
value of ρ* (depending on λ), the ISMS of cube-like particles
seems to be recovering to values more comparable to that of spherical
particles. This posited regime change is also evident in the main
plot of Figure 2, where
for λ = (3, 4) we can see the value of φ where the chain
formation model begins to abruptly fail. It seems then that the chain
formation model can accurately describe the particle correlations
that manifest in the initial mechanism, but fails to do so once this
secondary state has been entered. We believe this second region, the
onset of which is dependent on all three system parameters (q, ρ*, λ), results from the evolving nature
of the agglomeration occurring as the systems become increasingly
concentrated and correlated; perhaps ring formation is beginning to
exert some influence.

One further mapping, to the Langevin susceptibility
χl, allows for another commensurate
comparison.
In particular, it emphasizes variations in particle correlations.
This plot of χ0vs χl appears in the upper portion of Figure 3; the line, symbol and color
identifications are exactly equivalent to those described for Figure 2. The dashed-dotted
black line gives the linear Langevin ISMS law, which one should recall
neglects the effect of magnetic correlations between particles. We
have limited the range to 0 < χl < 2.0 so that the densely packed region at low χl is easier to see. With this in mind, one can see
that for values of χl < 0.5,
the linear relationship holds, indicating the absence of strongly
correlated particles. For χl >
1.0,
we begin to see large discrepancies between the data and the linear
curve, indicating the increasing importance of the magnetic correlations.
Furthermore, one can state that for a given χl (at higher values of λ), the same trend of lowering
χ0 for increasing q is observed,
unmistakably showing that systems at the equivalent state-point are
less correlated for superballs that are more cubic. One should note
the fact that the theoretical curves for each q at
the various λ show little difference. This is due to the fact
that there is no explicit variation in how the correlations are calculated
as q is increased.

Figure 3 Upper plot: χ0vs χl. The color bar above
the plot indicates
the value of magnetic coupling parameter. The black dashed-dotted
line represents the linear Langevin ISMS law. Lower plot: χ0vs λ for equal νsb, where λ has been scaled by a factor of 1/(h*)3, which depends on the value of q.
The color bar at the top left of the plot denotes the respective system
density. Please note the use of a log scale on the ordinate axis of
this plot. The line and symbol identifications obey the legends appearing
in each plot, respectively. The error bars in both plots denote the
standard deviation of the mean.

The approach we have used here was chosen as such to scale
in terms
of comparable interaction energies, rather than comparable particle
volumes. Yet in experiment, particle volume and the magnetic moment
are directly related, m ∝ νsb. Thus, in general, λ can not be kept fixed
as particle volume increases. To address this issue, we performed
a number of complementary simulations for systems at ρ* = (0.05,
0.075), for fixed values of the magnetic moment (m*)2 = (1–5) in integer steps. We fixed the particle
volume for each value of q to νsb = π/6, which consequently varies the length of the principal
axis, h* = (1.0, 0.9382, 0.9026) for q = (1.0,1.25,150), respectively. The variation of the ISMS with λ
for these systems is shown in the lower plot of Figure 3, where the symbol and line identifications
are given by the legend in the lower right-hand corner, and each density
is colored according to the inset color bar appearing at the top left.
The ordinate axis of this plot uses a log scale. It is crucial to
note that as the size of h* now varies as a function
of q, λ should adjust accordingly, i.e., by a factor of 1/(h*)3. We can see from the figure in question further evidence
of the decrease in susceptibility, using the appropriately scaled
values of λ. The theoretical predictions again do well, but
also begin to break down as the secondary regime is entered at λ
∼ 4.

Interestingly, however, this does not tell the full
story. One
further observation, at constant density, can be made. It is evident
from the figure that systems with low m* have an
ISMS that does not significantly change with increasing q, while for higher values of m*, the ISMS is seen
to increase as a function of q. This implies the
following extremely interesting assertion. Suppose one could make
a number of stable colloidal suspensions in the laboratory using superball
particles of precisely equal volumes with different shape parameters.
If one were to make no assumptions regarding the strength of the interactions
involved, the measured ISMS of each suspension would actually be the
same, if not higher, as the particles become more cubic. At first
glance, this seems to be a major contradiction. However, this comparison
is not made on an equal basis in terms of the physics of the system
we have modeled; namely, we consider a colloidal particle with a point
dipole placed in its center. Therefore, the increase measured, rather
than originating from the effect of the particle geometry, would simply
be related to the fact that, at equal particle volumes, the length
of the particle’s principle axis decreases as q increases. Hence, the observation is simply due to the fact that
the dipoles of each particle can get closer to each other as they
become more cubic. Thus, to properly assess the effect of the particle
geometry, a comparison in terms of interaction energy is the correct
approach. As such, the rest of the manuscript focuses on the analysis
of systems based on this foundation, i.e., particles whose principal axes are of equal lengths, h* = 1.

It is useful at this point to provide a brief interlude
to summarize
what we have elucidated so far. Primarily, we now know that the ISMS
of a bulk suspension lowers as the constituent magnetic superballs
become more cube-like; a fact that is neatly encapsulated by our basic
modification of the chain formation model for spheres; a framework,
which we show is valid for a preliminary regime encompassing, in general,
the lower end of the range of φ and λ ⩽ 4. Second,
the onset of what we believe is a subsequent regime has been identified,
but as yet not fully explained. Third, the observation of evidently
higher correlations for more spherical superballs suggests that the
same trend should be present in the structure of the system aggregation
one should observe. To clarify a number of these statements, we chose
to ascertain a more detailed picture of the microstructure present,
allowing us to rationalize and account for the observed macroscopic
magnetic response.

Cluster Analysis and Microstructure
In order to provide
some kind of explanation for the drop in ISMS we have observed, we
constructed connectivity networks representative of the system evolution
at each state point. Thus, a detailed understanding of the cluster
formation could be achieved. The first application of this connectivity
network method to dipolar systems was in relation to polymeric style
magnetic brushes composed of dipolar filaments.46 The methodology applied here follows closely this implementation,
and those looking for the intricacies and full terminology of the
procedure should consult ref (46) in detail. Furthermore, we recently trialled the applicability
of this approach in relation to suspensions of magnetic spheres and
cubes.47 This work provided the proof of
concept necessary to allow the successful application of this technique
to the current concern.

The algorithm used here follows closely
that described in ref (47), and what follows is a number of reminders regarding definitions
and bonding criteria purely for the reader’s convenience. Within
a given system configuration, each particle forms a single vertex
of a connectivity graph. If two particles are bonded to one another,
an edge is drawn between the two corresponding vertices. Two particles
are said to be bonded if the following criteria are met: the two particles
must be within a certain distance of one another, i.e. ⩽1.1, and the dipolar interaction energy
between them must be favorable, i.e. < 0. The distance criterion is derived from the two particle
interaction potential; it represents the distance at which two collinear
dipoles are at 75% of the attractive well-depth. Once all the edges
have been mapped out, the connected subgraphs constitute the clusters
that have formed in the system, indicating immediately their size
and general topology. A particularly useful measure of interest is
termed the vertex degree, it being the number of edges (bonds) associated
with a particular vertex (particle). As such, the vertex degree can
give us an excellent idea about the propensity with which particles
like to form bonds. As with any system observable, all the measurements
taken regarding cluster composition are reported as ensemble averages.
It should be noted, as periodic boundary conditions were in effect
during the simulations, extra care was required when identifying bonded
particles. Specifically, clusters were allowed to form across the
periodic boundaries of the simulation box, ensuring that no clusters
were artificially truncated.

As an initial measure of the aggregation
occurring in these magnetic
superball systems, we will turn to a simple pictorial assessment,
namely, the series of simulation snapshots appearing in Figure 4; the snapshot array is for
the set of systems with ρ* = 0.075. Each row of the array is
for a single q, which increases in a downward direction,
and each column is for a single λ increasing from left to right.
Each snapshot shown is the final configuration recorded from the production
period of the respective simulation runs. The coloring of the superballs
is a result of the cluster analysis we have performed. A particle
is colored according to the cluster to which it belongs; the cluster
color is determined by the color bar appearing on the right-hand side
of the figure, noting that monomers are colored white. This way we
can get an immediate impression of the amount and scale of the agglomeration
at each state-point. Along a single row, we see the aggregation increase
for each value of q in line with the growing value
of λ in terms of not only the number of clusters but also the
size of individual clusters. Down a column, however, the opposite
is true; the abundance and length of clusters reduces as q increases for fixed λ. Considering the snapshot array in its
entirety, the propensity for cluster formation is in general much
higher for superballs that are more spherically shaped. In the interest
of completeness, the equivalent snapshot arrays for the other values
of ρ* can be found in the Supporting Information. The observations made bode well for the links that will be drawn
to the magnetic response later on; beforehand, more quantitative measures
of the bonding are required.

Figure 4 A snapshot array of state points with a density
of ρ* = 0.075.
Each row corresponds to state points with the annotated value of q, and each column corresponds to the annotated value of
λ. The coloring of clusters is in accordance with the color
bar appearing on the right-hand side of the figure, where monomers
are colored white.

Two further quantitative
measures that illustrate the variation
in cluster formation across the parameter space: the average cluster
size ⟨N⟩ (excluding monomers) and the
aggregation percentage (Agg–%), i.e., the percentage of particles in the system forming at
least one bond. The first measure is of course an indicator of the
size that clusters in the system reach, while the second is an indicator
of the overall connectivity within the suspension. These two quantities
are displayed in the form of bar charts appearing in Figure 5. Both bar charts are organized
in the same way: the quantity of interest appears on the ordinate
axis; the abscissa organizes the bars into seven groups corresponding
to the value of ρ* indicated; within each group the value of q is indicated by the bar hatching, circles (q = 1.00), horizontal lines (q = 1.25), and diagonal
lines (q = 1.50); the value of λ is given according
to the color bar appearing on the right of the figure; finally, the
extra spacing appearing in the groupings for ρ* = 0.15, 0.2
is due to the absence of λ = 5 for these densities. Presenting
the data in this fashion allows one to identify the trends across
each variable ρ*, q, and λ.

Figure 5 Top: bar chart
of ⟨N⟩ vs ρ*.
Bottom: bar chart of Agg–% vs ρ*.
The respective density value of each bar chart set is given at the
top of each plot. The hatching of the bars indicates the value of
the shape parameter according to the following identifications: circles, q = 1.00; horizontal lines, q = 1.25; and
diagonal lines, q = 1.50. The color coding for the
respective λ in these plots obeys the color bar appearing at
the right-hand side.

Beginning with average cluster size, we observe for a given
ρ*
and q the increase of ⟨N⟩
for increasing λ, as one would expect due to the increasing
strength of the magnetic interaction. For a given ρ*, the tendency
for ⟨N⟩ to decrease with increasing q is clearly seen for all values of λ. Furthermore,
we also observe a slight (if not almost negligible) increase in ⟨N⟩ as a function of ρ* at low values of λ
for each q, whereas the rate of increase accelerates
at higher values of λ. Moving to the aggregation percentage
we can see that exactly the same trends are prevalent, although much
easier to elucidate, as the variation of this quantity between state
points is much stronger. The trends we have identified corroborate
our visual inspection of the snapshots from Figure 4 (and in the Supporting
Information), albeit the snapshots only give us an instantaneous
interpretation of the system in comparison to these time-averaged
measures. Regardless, the equivalent behavior is evident from both:
the onset of agglomeration in magnetic superball suspensions is delayed
to higher values of λ as the shape parameter of the particle
is increased, and for a given ρ* and λ, the connectivity
of the suspension and the size of clusters formed decreases as the
particles become more cubic.

We now turn to the vertex degree
δ that was alluded to earlier.
It maps out clearly the bonding present in the systems. We have chosen
to present the data using histograms in order to give an idea of the
average distribution of δ at each state point. The histograms
are shown in Figure 6. Each individual plot is for the denoted pair of values (q, ρ*), where ρ* increases downward in three
plot intervals. Within a single plot is a histogram for each value
of λ, once more colored according to the color bar at the top
of the figure; an equivalently colored vertical line denotes the average
value of the corresponding distribution. The ordinate axis represents
the probability of a particular value of δ, where the abscissa
is the value of δ binned according to the Freedman–Diaconis
rule. The vertex degree was recorded and averaged for each particle
in a given simulation. Therefore, a single histogram for given (λ, q, ρ*) represents the distribution of the particles’
average δ.

Figure 6 Plots of δ histograms. The parameter indicator appearing
at the top right of each plot denotes the values (q, ρ*). The color bar at the top of the figure indicates the
value of magnetic coupling parameter. The vertical colored lines denote
the average value of the corresponding distribution.

Immediately, one can see from each plot the progression
of the
distribution to higher values of δ, as λ is increased.
Furthermore, for each individual value of ρ* the extent of this
progression is hindered with increasing q. Interestingly,
the progression for each set of fixed λ and q appears to begin to saturate as a function of ρ*. This array
of plots illustrates definitively the influence of q, specifically on the bonding taking place in each system. As we
can interpret δ as the number of bonds a single superball likes
to form, it is explicitly clear from the histograms that the increase
of q significantly hampers bond formation. Additionally,
this analysis allows us to make some general comments on the probable
topologies of the clusters formed. In particular, the data suggest
the tendency for the formation of nonbranched cluster types i.e., chains and rings. The values of δ
measured are all significantly <2, suggesting the probability of
a branched structure is extremely low, owing to the requirement that
a superball particle acting as a branching point would need δ
⩾ 3. Furthermore, state points with δ ∼ 1.0 will
actually tend to be abundant in dimers; the value of δ implies
a reluctance of particles to form subsequent bonds.

To conclude
our analysis we looked inside each bond at the configuration
of the constituent dipoles. In particular, we analyzed the distribution
of the interdipole angle θd and
both interdipole–displacement angles θr(1) and θr(2). These angles are defined for two bonded particles 1 and 2 as 11  Each
angle runs over a domain of (0, π).
No constraints were imposed upon these angles, avoiding any unintentional
bias being applied to the direction of the displacement vector. Its
direction was treated in the same manner throughout the analysis, i.e., always from particle 1 to particle
2 of the bond, irrespective of the dipole orientations. Calculation
of these angles not only provides an indication of the symmetry of
clusters but also visualizes how the bonds fluctuate. This wealth
of information can be attained by constructing bivariate histograms
for pairs of these angles. Specifically, we have plotted the probability
density functions, fdr(1) = f(θd,θr(1)) and frr = f(θr(1),θr(2)), binned according to a two-dimensional
variant of the bin optimization routine outlined by Shimazaki and
Shinomoto.48 Due to symmetry, the probability
density function fdr(2) = f(θd,θr(2)) is qualitatively equivalent
to fdr(1) and thus provides no further insight.
The histograms for fdr(1) and frr are plotted in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
These plot-arrays appear for the same parameter set used in Figure 4, i.e., ρ*=0.075, with q increasing
down each column and λ increasing along each row. Each bin is
colored according to the corresponding value of the probability density
function; the color bars used are shown on the right of each figure.
As the propensity for bonding increases with λ and decreases
with q, the bin size adjusts accordingly. Quantities
such as these are not strong functions of the system density, and
as such, no further information or understanding is gained from the
presentation of systems at the other densities considered.

Figure 7 Histogram array
of the probability density function fdr(1), of the angle pair (θd,θr1). The state points displayed have a density
of ρ* = 0.075. Each row corresponds to state points with the
annotated value of q, and each column corresponds
to the annotated value of λ. The coloring of individual bins
is in accordance with the color bar appearing on the right-hand side
of the figure and represent the value of fdr(1) at that particular angle combination.

Figure 8 Histogram array of the probability density function frr, of the angle pair (θr(1),θr(2)). The state points displayed have a density
of ρ* = 0.075. Each row corresponds to state points with the
annotated value of q, and each column corresponds
to the annotated value of λ. The coloring of individual bins
is in accordance with the color bar appearing on the right-hand side
of the figure and represents the value of frr at that particular angle combination.

The evolution of these histograms as a function
of λ and q tells us a great deal about the
system. If we consider
the first pair of angles (θd,θr1), shown in Figure 7, we see the emergence of two peaks as λ is increased, an observation
that occurs for each value of q. The sharpness and
height of these peaks strongly increase as a function of q. Furthermore, we see regions of the parameter space become void
of bonds with increasing q, particularly for higher
values of λ. Focusing on the three histograms for λ =
5, we can see how the peaks proceed to smaller values of θd, indicating that the dipoles in the bonds
become better aligned with one another. The peaks also proceed to
the extremities of the θr(2) range (i.e., 0 and π), which suggests that the dipoles within
the bond become increasingly colinear. The reason for the appearance
of two different peak positions in θr(2) is simply due to scenarios
where the displacement vector is treated in the opposite direction
to that of the dipoles, resulting in angles also in the vicinity of
π, not just 0. This fact also provides an additional equilibration
check, whereby the distribution is extremely symmetric across the
line θr(2) = π/2, suggesting no remanent magnetization
is present in the system. In general, these histogram arrays suggest
that the diffuse nature of the peaks for low q should
allow for not only straight linear cluster formation but also for
the presence of flexible configurations. As q increases,
the dominance of straighter chains is cemented, because the dipole
configurations within bonds favor parallel colinear confirmations.

Moving to the second angle pair, in Figure 8, we can make some further interesting observations.
The same generic trends observed for the peak formation in the first
angle pair also hold here. We have two peaks developing with increasing
λ, which sharpen and tend toward (0,0) and (π,π)
as q increases. This confirms the increasingly straight
shape of chains as q increases. The appearance of
bond-deficient regions of the parameter space is again observed, but
to a lesser extent than for the previous combination. This indicates
that increasing q acts to restrict the mutual orientation
of the dipoles (θd) to a far greater
extent than the displacement related angles. This validates, in part,
our assumptions regarding the calculation of the dimer partition function,
where we imposed this very criterion. A perfectly straight chain can
only be realized by constraining all three angles. This is crucial
when considering, in addition to the head-to-tail dipole configuration,
the antiparallel pair configuration that dipoles can adopt. One can
access their prevalence in these systems by analyzing both sets of
histograms in the proximity of (θd,θr1) = (π,π/2) and (θr1,θr2) = (π/2,π/2). In doing so, it
becomes clear that this region of the parameter space is certainly
not unpopulated. The number of bonds adopting configurations close
to an antiparallel pair, however, is significantly lower that of bonds
adopting head-to-tail configurations. This disparity grows as q increases. Therefore, we can safely say that the influence
of antiparallel dipoles greatly diminishes as the dominance of straights
chains establishes itself with increasing q.

At this stage, we hope that the parallels between the ISMS of each
state point and the corresponding microstructure we elucidated there
are clearly discernible. It is evident that each of the measures discussed
are self-consistent and substantiate the observed trend in the ISMS.
The prevalent notion to be gained from ⟨N⟩
and Agg–% in Figure 5 is for a given ρ*, both quantities decrease with increasing q, across each value of λ considered. This highlights
the fact that the self-assembly taking place is inhibited as the colloidal
particles become more cubic. These two facts themselves provide the
bulk of the explanation for the decrease in ISMS. As the size and
concentration of clusters decrease, fewer fluctuations in the instantaneous
magnetization occur, which, as we are in the linear response regime,
must result in a lowering of the ISMS. The reduction in the average
number of bonds formed for more cubic particles, as exemplified in Figure 6, provides further
evidence for the reducing probability of bonds forming. Moreover, Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the fact that fewer low-energy (less negative)
dipole configurations are available as q increases.
In one sense, this can be seen from the perspective of the cubic particles
as a delay in the onset of self-assembly to ever higher values of
λ. In other words, the more cubic a particle is, the stronger
the magnetic interaction required for bonding to occur. This assertion
explains, in part, why the theoretical framework performs objectively
better the more cubic the particles become; it is simply the case
that there are less correlations in the system, which means the ones
present are easier for the framework to encapsulate.

One question
remains however, namely, what is the reason for the
apparent aversion to bonding that cubic particles have in comparison
to spheres at the same λ? The appropriate reasoning can be found
by considering the concept of bonding volume. This bonding volume
relates to the proportion of phase space where the formation of a
bond between two superballs can take place. In this context, this
is the region where the separation and orientation of two superball
dipoles is such that it is sufficiently favorable to hold the two
particles together. It follows that this bonding volume changes as
a function of the shape parameter; it decreases and then saturates
as the particle tends toward a perfect cube. This reduction in the
available phase space means that it becomes immediately more difficult
for the particles to form bonds, even for these moderate perturbations
from sphericity. The presence of this effect is evident from the histograms
in Figures 7 and 8. It is clear that the number of angle combinations
that bonds can adopt reduces significantly as q increases.
This is a physical demonstration of the reduction in accessible phase
space volume. These data reinforce the idea of decreasing bonding
probability with growing q, primarily due to the
number of suitable stable configurations decreasing.

At the
beginning of this manuscript we posited the prospect of
cubic particles creating more field susceptible suspensions, by way
of their increased preference for chain aggregates. Not only have
we shown this preconception to be false, we have provided the reasons
why this is the case. In particular, even although increasing q shifts the cluster equilibrium from flux-closure rings
to field-sensitive chains, we have shown that the probability of chain
formation actually decreases as q increases. This
observation comes with the caveat that under the physical conditions
considered, the explicit competition between chains and rings is expected
to be low. However, the decreasing difference between the ISMS of
cube-like and spherical particles at λ ∼ 4–5 suggests
that, as the precursor to ring formation begins for spheres, the evidently
straighter chain clusters of cubic particles prevent the mechanism
from occurring to the same extent. This presents the opportunity for
the ISMS of cubic particle systems to, in a sense, catch-up. In the
working region of parameters considered here, the limitations in effect
for cubic particles delay the onset of cluster formation, resulting
in objectively less correlation and thus the lower susceptibility
we observed.

Conclusion
The rationale behind
this work was a simple one: What effect does
particle shape, cubic geometry in particular, have on the corresponding
magnetic response of a stable magnetic fluid of colloidal superballs?
The desire to address this question was motivated by the suspicion
that owing to the preference of cubic particles with a [001] dipole
to form chain aggregates, higher values of the ISMS could have been
achievable. A supposition based on the fact that chains are a much
more field-favorable cluster topology than rings.41 At the “ambient” temperature conditions considered
here, the contribution of ring structures to the susceptibility of
spheres is somewhat negligible. This shifts the dependency of the
ISMS from the explicit topology of clusters that result from self-assembly
to the two-particle bonding process itself. In this way, we managed
to attribute the q-induced drop in ISMS to this basic
consideration, correcting in the process our initial preconceptions.

Our understanding of the system was enriched by a detailed analysis
of the microstructure at each state point. This analysis not only
corroborated the conclusions drawn from the computation of the ISMS
but also facilitated the understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms
in effect. The ability to visualize the aggregation in the system
allowed for the significantly less correlated cubic systems to be
easily identified. Furthermore, our modifications to the existing
MMFT have proved valid. The resulting framework—particularly
at low volume fractions and moderate magnetic coupling—faithfully
represents the variation in the response of the system as a function
of the shape parameter.

At first glance, it would appear that
the tempered response of
more cube-like particles is somewhat of a set back toward the aim
of producing more field-responsive magnetic liquids. Be that as it
may, there are a number of scenarios we can foresee where the opportunity
for cubic particles to exhibit an advantage over their spherical counterparts
may persist. The indicators of such prospects are found in the results
of this work, but further study is required to confirm these conjectures.
The first of these scenarios has been alluded to previously, namely,
the effect of temperature. Although the persistence of ring structures
for similarly q-valued superballs was recently reported,
the likelihood of the abrupt decrease in ISMS with decreasing temperature
is unlikely.25 Thus, the prospect of cubic
particles being more suitable for low temperature conditions is still
very much in the cards. The second scenario that comes to mind is
one where a sharper transition in terms of magnetic coupling strength
is required. Careful consultation of the cluster analysis (numerical
and pictorial) seems to indicate the possibility that the transition
from a dispersed to an aggregated system occurs more quickly (i.e., over a smaller range of λ)
as the particles become more cubic. The evolution in the aggregation
of the spherical system appears more gradual. Thus, one can envisage
the situation where a fluid with a sharper transition would benefit
applications where the switchable nature of a ferro-colloid is of
primary concern. Two state binary operation may allow for greater
precision to be achieved.

Model and Methods
Particle
Model
In our simulations we have approximated
the explicit shape of superball particles using a scheme developed
in ref (25); an extension
to a preliminary model described in ref (41). The model in question utilizes constituent
spheres to construct the superball surface according to eq 1. This is successfully achieved
by placing the spheres at significant locations within the superball
geometry, namely the vertices and the midpoint of each edge. The radii
of the spheres are then set to match the radius of curvature of the
superball at the given location. In this manner, one can mimic the
superball geometry for low values of the shape parameter. As we have
only considered modest increases in q, this model
is more than suitable for our purposes. We have used a total of 21
spheres to construct our superball particles (8 vertices and 12 edges;
plus one central sphere of diameter h*).

There
are two interaction types present in our model: steric and magnetic.
The nonmagnetic interaction between two superballs is simply that
of excluded volume. For the purposes of our analytical calculations,
the particles are treated as hard bodies. This scenario is emulated
in simulation using Weeks–Chandler–Anderson potentials
that act between the spherical sites of opposing superballs.49 As discussed in ref (25), the cutoff radius rc for the steric potentials is defined as rc = 21/6σss; the interaction parameter ϵ, specific
to the short-range potentials, was set to 1000; and all of the average
site diameters σss were scaled by
2–1/6. This increases the similarity to a perfect
hard particle scenario by steepening the potential and shifting the
effective hard particle cutoff to unity. Therefore, the particles
can be effectively considered as hard particles of size h*. This type of short-range interaction is a straightforward representation
of the steric or ionic stabilization required in experiment to produce
a colloidal suspension. A commonly asked question relates to our use
of this model as apposed to an analytical overlap approach. The answer
is discussed in some detail in ref (25); the arguments relate essentially to the efficiency
of calculating the magnetic interaction, whereby advanced algorithms
and parallelization can be employed in a more advantageous manner.
Furthermore, it is important to recall that the hard/softness of steric
potentials do not impact greatly on the resulting magnetic character
of dipolar systems, especially for the range of magnetic coupling
parameter we have considered.39

The
magnetic character of the particles is described using a dipolar
approximation. A single dipole was placed at the center of mass of
each superball and oriented to lie along the [001] crystallographic
axis, i.e., from face-to-face. Thus,
the magnetic interaction between two dipolar superballs was governed
by the familiar dipolar formulation. This choice of magnetic configuration
makes a number of key assumptions about the particles in relation
to their experimental realization (full details in ref (25)). It assumes the following:
particles are single domain, in a size range of ∼10–100
nm; Brownian, not Neél, is the domain relaxation mechanism;
remnant magnetization is present brought about by some variety of
magnetic ordering (e.g., ferro/ferri);
and this remnant magnetization can be presumed to have a fixed orientation
if a high degree of magneto-crystalline anisotropy is present.

Molecular
Dynamics
Extensive computer simulations were
performed, facilitated by the use of the ESPReSSo 3.3.0 simulation
package, to compute the zero-field magnetic response of our low-density
superball fluids.50 Our superballs are
magnetic, conveniently therefore, no explicit coupling between the
dispersed superballs and suspending fluid is present. As such, we
have performed bulk, three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations
using a Langevin thermostat to affect constant-temperature conditions.
The thermostat introduces a velocity-dependent friction term and includes
the application of random jolts to the particles. These mechanisms
serve as the drag force and the Brownian motion induced by the surrounding
fluid. The implementation of this method in combination with our particle
model is discussed in ref (25).

In this contribution, however, we are considering
bulk, three-dimensional systems at ambient temperatures; a set of
criteria that comes with its own distinct challenges. To this end,
simulations were conducted in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions
applied, mimicking the conditions present in bulk fluid. The central
concern was how to appropriately compute the dipolar interactions,
as the difficulties in dealing with these long-range forces are well
documented. To handle this issue, we employed the particle-particle
particle-mesh (P3M) algorithm, which efficiently handles
the computations required.51

All
of our simulations were conducted in a set of dimensionless
units (as defined in ref (25)), which are denoted by a superscript asterisk. For our
current investigation, we set temperature to unity T* = kT = 1, which reduces the magnetic coupling
parameter as follows λ = (m*)2/T* = (m*)2. The equations of
motion were propagated using the velocity Verlet algorithm, where
a time step of Δt* = 0.002 was found to be
the most suitable choice. The accuracy of the P3M algorithm
is determined by the absolute root-mean-square error in the dipolar
forces. This was set as ΔFdip* ⩽ 10–4 for all simulations conducted. In this study we are
solely concerned with equilibrium properties; the values of mass,
inertia, and translational/rotation friction coefficients are physically
inconsequential. Each was set to unity with the exception of the rotational
friction coefficient, which takes the value of a third. This choice
provides the quickest possible convergence to equilibrium.

The
protocol used for each simulation consisted of the following
steps. An initial configuration of N = 512 monodisperse
superball particles was generated. Particle positions were randomly
distributed over the volume of the simulation box, and dipole orientations
were randomly distributed over the complete solid angle. The system
was then propagated through an equilibration cycle. The number of
steps required to achieve equilibration was typically on the order
of 2–9 × 106 Δt*. The
sizable range quoted is due to the strong dependence of the equilibration
time on the exact physical conditions. Magnetic fluctuations, as well
as the system energy, were monitored to ensure a steady state was
achieved prior to any measurements being taken.

Once equilibration
was achieved, a production period of 200 blocks
was performed, with block-lengths ranging from 1–3.5 ×
104 Δt*. A single block included
measurements of the quantities of interest, e.g., magnetization and energy, evenly spaced at intervals
of 100 Δt*. The ISMS was calculated using block
averaging, which allowed an appropriate estimate of the associated
error (standard deviation of the mean) to be made. Furthermore, on
completion of a single block, a snapshot of the system configuration
(particle positions and dipolar orientations) was recorded to facilitate
the subsequent structural analysis. The statistical independence of
the measurements was verified by careful consultation of the |M|2 autocorrelation function.
