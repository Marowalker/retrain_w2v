Over
the past decades, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has emerged
as an increasingly powerful tool to study the dynamics of biomolecules
at nanometer length scales. However, the more stochastic the nature
of such biomolecular dynamics, the harder it becomes to distinguish
them from AFM measurement noise. Rapid, stochastic dynamics are inherent
to biological systems comprising intrinsically disordered proteins.
One role of such proteins is in the formation of the transport barrier
of the nuclear pore complex (NPC): the selective gateway for macromolecular
traffic entering or exiting the nucleus. Here, we use AFM to observe
the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins from two systems:
the transport barrier of native NPCs and the transport barrier of
a mimetic NPC made using a DNA origami scaffold. Analyzing data recorded
with 50–200 ms temporal resolution, we highlight the importance
of drift correction and appropriate baseline measurements in such
experiments. In addition, we describe an autocorrelation analysis
to quantify time scales of observed dynamics and to assess their veracity—an
analysis protocol that lends itself to the quantification of stochastic
fluctuations in other biomolecular systems. The results reveal the
surprisingly slow rate of stochastic, collective transitions inside
mimetic NPCs, highlighting the importance of FG-nup cohesive interactions.

With its
ability to resolve
biomolecules in aqueous solution at a spatial resolution of ∼1
nm,1 atomic force microscopy (AFM) can
observe dynamic biological processes at the single-molecule level,
without chemical tagging. Thanks to technological advances in microscope
hardware, cantilevers, and imaging modes, this high spatial resolution
has become compatible with a temporal resolution on the order of 100
ms per frame (often denoted as high-speed AFM, or HS-AFM),2 or 0.5–1 ms for monitoring individual
scan lines.3−5 Over the years, AFM has allowed real-time visualization
of diverse biological systems, from the binding/unbinding of GroEL
molecules3 to molecular motors walking
along actin filaments,6 DNA cleaving by
Cas9,7 and a range of protein assembly
processes4,8−10 (among many other applications).2

When the observed dynamics are progressive
in nature and have a
magnitude well above the noise floor of the AFM, they can be unambiguously
associated with molecular motion, binding, or conformational change.
However, at molecular length scales, such dynamics invariably contain
a stochastic component, and when the magnitude of these dynamics is
≲1 nm, they are not trivial to distinguish from AFM measurement
noise or feedback errors that may arise when tracing molecular contours
at high scan speeds. Such stochastic dynamics are arguably most pronounced
for natively unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins.11 Unlike structured proteins, intrinsically disordered
proteins have a low sequence complexity and fluctuate rapidly over
an ensemble of conformations ranging from extended statistical coils
to more collapsed globules. Such proteins play a central role in a
number of cellular processes: one important example being the selective
filtering of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.12−14

A large, proteinaceous self-assembly, known as the nuclear
pore
complex (NPC), controls this flow of materials into and out of the
nucleus. The NPC has a cylindrical scaffold that perforates the nuclear
envelope, creating a central channel of ∼40 nm in diameter
(see Figure 1A,B, schematics).
This channel anchors intrinsically disordered proteins enriched with
multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats, known as FG-nucleoporins (or
FG-nups). In combination with soluble proteins (nuclear transport
receptors; or NTRs), these FG-nups collectively form a selective barrier
to nucleocytoplasmic transport.15,16 Exactly how they do
this remains a topic of debate.14

AFM images of NPCs with the cytoplasmic (A) and nucleoplasmic (B)
sides facing the AFM tip and of a DNA-origami-based NPC mimic (“NuPOD”;5 C) that contains 48 Nsp1 proteins, resting on
a supported lipid bilayer. The NPC is asymmetrical when viewed through
the mirror plane of the nuclear envelope: From the cytoplasmic face,
cytoplasmic filaments are seen (yellow filaments), and from the nucleoplasmic
face, the nuclear basket protrudes (red filaments). The disordered
FG-nups are shown in green (A–C). Kymographs are obtained by
recording the same scan line across the pore (white-dashed lines in
AFM images) as a function of time (horizontal axis of the kymographs).
Note the differences in scale bars between the NPC and NuPOD data.
Height scales (insets in kymographs): 80 nm for the NPCs and 20 nm
for the NuPOD.

AFM has proven itself
as a useful tool for probing the dynamics
of FG-nups inside real NPCs, with high-speed experiments potentially
revealing dynamic movement of individual FG-nups at the cytoplasmic
periphery of the pore15,16 and high-resolution studies revealing
many different metastable collective morphologies of FG-nups and soluble
NTRs inside the central channel.17 Both
of these results support the notion that the “cohesivity”
of the FG-nups is tuned such that the energetics of stable FG-nup
morphologies lie near transition states, as has been postulated in
computational studies.18−20 One of the caveats with these experimental results,
however, is that the exact chemical composition of the NPC’s
transport barrier is ill-defined. Structural studies indicate that,
by mass, the FG-nups only comprise (approximately) one-third of the
material inside the channel; the majority of the pore lumen is filled
with NTRs and cargo molecules (i.e., macromolecules bound with NTRs) caught in transit.21 Therefore, to better understand the behavior
and function of the FG-nups within this complex system, mimetic NPCs
made using DNA origami have recently been created.5,22

The NuPOD (NucleoPorins Organized on DNA) system provides
a platform for studying FG-nup behavior in the
cylindrical geometry. It is designed to mimic the dimensions of the
NPC central transport channel across species:5 The NuPOD inner diameter is ∼32–46 nm, in approximate
agreement with, for example, the Xenopus laevis transport
channel of ∼40 nm inner diameter.17,23 Furthermore, the system can accommodate a defined number and type
of FG-nups. NuPODs therefore contain purely the disordered FG-nups
of a known composition and grafting density (concentration).

In this study, we use AFM to probe the dynamic behavior of disordered
FG-nups across the transport barrier of both real NPCs and mimetic
NPCs (NuPODs) containing two different types of purified FG-nup domains
from S. cerevisiae, Nsp1 and Nup100, which are orthologues
to metazoan Nup62 and Nup98, respectively. For a quantitative comparison
of their relative “cohesivity”, see refs (19 and 20). We present analysis, procedures, and criteria to distinguish between
the stochastic dynamics of these proteins (often on length scales
of ≲1 nm) and the fluctuations due to (also largely stochastic)
AFM measurement noise. By applying a drift-correction routine and
a subsequent autocorrelation analysis to the pixel heights with time,
we can both quantify the time-scale of any dynamic behavior observed
and probe the effect of the tip–sample interaction force on
the behavior of the system, thus providing a more rigorous approach
to interpreting HS-AFM data. In doing so, we reveal the time-scale
of collective dynamics of the pure FG-nups inside the NuPOD system,
thus further elucidating their precise role in nucleocytoplasmic transport.
For simplicity and clarity of representation and for enhanced temporal
resolution, we here confine ourselves to kymographs acquired by recording
single lines across the center of the pores as a function of time
(Figure 1),3 but note that our analysis can also be extended
to frame-by-frame recordings (Supplementary Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
When acquiring AFM data, temporal
resolution can be greatly increased
by reducing the dimension of scanning to the fast-scan axis only (as
was done in this study), thereby producing kymographs. It can be increased
further by removing this dimension also and recording the height of
a single pixel with time (this has been termed HS-AFM height spectroscopy).4 In all types of time-resolved AFM, to accurately
measure local height fluctuations as a function of time, lateral drift
in the experimental setup must be minimized. Even when using an AFM
system with a closed-loop scanner (here: Dimension FastScan, Bruker),
in which the sample position is continuously verified to ∼1
nm accuracy, lateral drift still occurs due to scanner hysteresis
and thermal equilibration. Therefore, it is only by recording data
in at least one dimension spatially (thus rendering points of reference)
and employing a drift-correction routine that we can ensure we are
recording the same point in space with time. A drift-correction protocol
is most accurate when referenced to static objects with steep slopes
or protrusions in the data, as this is where a given lateral displacement
results in the largest change in the measured AFM signal (i.e., the sample height). Here, all scan
lines in a kymograph were aligned laterally by referencing them to
the outer edges of the static (and presumably rigid) pore scaffold
(see Supplementary Figure 2).

With
the kymographs corrected for experimental drift, measured
height variations for any given position in the kymograph are, ideally,
attributed solely to fluctuations as a function of time. Consequently,
the magnitude and time scale of these height fluctuations can be quantified
for each (lateral) position by the autocorrelation factor (R) as a function of time-lag (τ), defined as 1  where m and n refer to line numbers in the kymograph, N is the
total number of scan lines in the kymograph, Δt is the time between consecutive scan lines, zn denotes the pixel height (nm) of a given
pixel as a function of time (nΔt), and z̅ denotes the average pixel height
for the (lateral) position under consideration. In brief, R(τ) quantifies the similarity in height values for
a given pixel (in nm2) at a certain time lag. It can detect
a periodic signal shrouded by noise and the persistence time of stochastically
fluctuating signals (see Supplementary Figure 3 for the R(τ) outputs from various
simulated pixel fluctuations). Furthermore, it can be determined for
each pixel in a kymograph, and the resultant R(τ)
outputs can be represented as a heatmap as a function of both position
(nm) and time-lag (τ), with red showing greater correlation
and blue representing no correlation (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Kymographs and autocorrelation analysis of NPCs.
(A–D) Kymographs
of NPCs at the cytoplasmic face (top row), recorded as explained in Figure 1, but with time on
the vertical axis (recorded at line frequencies of 5 and 10 Hz). The
concomitant autocorrelation factor, R, is displayed
as a function of position with respect to the pore center and as a
function of time-lag, τ, with τ plotted on linear (second
row) and logarithmic (third row) scales. The average height profiles
(blue) and respective standard deviations (red) are plotted in the
final row. (E and F) Same as for (A–D) but for the nucleoplasmic
face of NPCs. Kymograph height scales: 50 nm (A and C), 60 nm (B),
25 nm (D), 40 nm (E and F). (A–D) Data each from different
NPCs. (E and F) The same NPC scanned at 5 and 10 Hz.

When this analysis is applied to kymographs produced
from the cytoplasmic
and nucleoplasmic sides of intact NPCs (Figure 2), at different scan speeds, no significant
fluctuations are detected in the positions of the central transport
channel (i.e., around the 0 nm position).
That is, the recorded fluctuations for positions occupied by the disordered
FG-nups are not distinguishable from those at the positions of the
nuclear envelope (a double membrane and lamin filaments, here supported
by a glass substrate).17 It remains possible
that FG-nup dynamics inside the central channel yield angström-scale
height variations (as have previously been reported for the cytoplasmic
face of the transport channel of NPCs),15,16 but in our
experiments, based on a similar sample preparation, these fluctuations
do not exceed the experimental noise floor. This is also apparent
from the standard deviation for each position in the kymograph (Figure 2, bottom row).

However, significant fluctuations are detected, in both the R(τ) heatmaps and standard deviation plots, at positions
that coincide with the edges of the NPC scaffold structure. At these
edges, lateral drift most strongly affects the detected height (in
spite of the applied drift correction, the observed fluctuations at
the outer NPC scaffold tend to be larger than the fluctuations detected
at the pore center), and the height is more prone to tracking/feedback
errors as the AFM tip traces protruding features. Hence, we attribute
these fluctuations to artifacts of the AFM imaging process.

Similar artifactual fluctuations are observed when the analysis
is applied to the empty pore scaffolds based on the biomimetic NuPOD
system (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 4). By contrast, when the
NuPODs contain grafted FG-nups, fluctuations are detected in the pore
center that greatly exceed those observed at the same positions in
the empty NuPODs or at the background supported lipid bilayer. This
is here illustrated for NuPODs each containing a maximum of 48 copies
of one of two types of FG-nup domains derived from the S.
cerevisiae (yeast) NPC (Figure 3B–G; see ref (5) for further details). If
48 Nsp1 molecules are present (Figure 3B–D), fluctuating clumps inside the central
channel are observed in the kymographs. At both 5 and 10 Hz (Figure 3B,C, respectively),
the autocorrelation heatmaps show a correlation up to ∼10 s,
while at 20 Hz, little significant correlation is detected beyond
1 s (see Figure 3D,
logarithmic plot). A similar pattern is observed for NuPODs containing
48 Nup100 molecules (Figure 3E–G). At 5 and 10 Hz, correlation is observed up to
∼10 s, but at 20 Hz, this appears to be reduced. Furthermore,
for all R(τ) heatmaps, no significant periodicity
is detected, and all heatmaps show signals more akin to stochastic
fluctuating behavior (see Supplementary Figure 3C and D).

Figure 3 Kymographs and autocorrelation analysis of NuPODs. Repeat
of kymograph
data, autocorrelation analysis, and averaged height and standard deviation
profiles, plotted as in Figure 2, but on NuPOD NPC mimics. Data are shown for an empty NuPOD,
that is, bare DNA scaffold without FG-nup domains (A), for NuPODs
containing 48 copies of Nsp1 (B–D), and for NuPODs containing
48 copies of Nup100 (E–G). The data of protein-containing NuPODs
were recorded at scan line frequencies of 5, 10, and 20 Hz (200, 100,
and 50 ms per scan line). (A–D and G) Data each from different
NuPODs. (E and F) The same NuPOD scanned at 5 and 10 Hz.

The results presented in Figure 3 are from individual NuPODs. Hence, the results
show
the stochastic dynamics of a disordered system within a given time
frame, resulting in unique kymographs. To assess dynamic behavior
over multiple measurements, it is useful to determine ensemble averages.
By averaging the kymographs directly, however, the noise would be
averaged out. By contrast, the autocorrelation heatmaps can be averaged
to build up a picture of the collective FG-nup fluctuations, from
many different NuPODs, or merging data recorded over longer times.
Furthermore, by cropping only a 30 nm window, which is smaller than
the inner-diameter of the NuPOD (∼32–46 nm),5 it is ensured that only contributions from the
FG-nups are considered. This eliminates any artifacts produced by
tracking errors from the AFM tip scanning over the DNA scaffold structure.
Next, by assuming the NuPODs display rotational symmetry, we can bin
the data as a function of radial position, and average. This produces
autocorrelation heatmaps as a function of radius, with 0 nm being
the center of the channel and 15 nm approaching the inner-wall of
the scaffold. The NuPODs containing 48 Nsp1 molecules (Figure 4A–C) exhibit similar
behavior to that shown from the individual kymographs (Figure 3B–D), that is, stochastic
fluctuations with a decreasing persistence time as the scan rate increases
from 5 to 10 to 20 Hz. A very similar picture is seen for the NuPODs
containing 48 Nup100 molecules (Figure 4D–F). At 5 Hz, significant correlation is seen
to up to ∼10 s (Figure 4D), and at 10 Hz, it is seen to persist into the 1–10
s range (Figure 4E).
At 20 Hz, however, the correlation does not persist much beyond 1
s (Figure 4F, logarithmic
plot).

Figure 4 Averaged autocorrelation analysis of the pore channel in NuPODs.
(A–C) R(τ) heatmaps averaged over n NuPODs, each containing 48 Nsp1 molecules, plotted as
a function of radial position from the center of the pore, scanned
at line rates of 5, 10, and 20 Hz. τ is plotted on both linear
(top row) and logarithmic scales (bottom row). (D–F) Same as
for (A–C) but the NuPODs contain 48 Nup100 molecules. From
(A–F): n = 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, and 3; total duration
of each kymograph = 739, 1050, 365, 586, 1907, and 1664 s. It should
be noted that one kymograph used in the averaging procedure to produce
(F) has previously been published as stand-alone data.5

By such comparison of autocorrelation
analysis of data recorded
at different scan speeds, we can also assess the robustness of our
results against AFM-dependent (i.e., not intrinsic) parameters. While the data in Figure 4A–F confirm the presence
of dynamics for all scan speeds shown here, in general, we observe
a decrease in persistence time with increasing scan speed. A plausible
explanation is that more aggressive feedback settings are required
to track the NuPODs at higher scan speeds (data here were all obtained
using tapping mode AFM, with the applied force minimized as much as
possible without losing track of the NuPODs). As a consequence, the
force sensitivity of the AFM reduces, and the flexible and mobile
FG-nups may increasingly be pushed away by the AFM tip. In this context,
we note that it is not trivial to quantify the forces applied and
energy dissipated into the sample10 and
that it is near impossible to translate such forces and energies into
plausible molecular deformations without the knowledge of the dissipative
mechanisms in the sample. It is possible, therefore, that the frequency
of FG-nup fluctuations would decrease further in the absence of the
AFM tip.

All six heatmaps (Figure 4A–F) show stochastic, fluctuating
behavior (see Supplementary Figure 3C,D) and more correlation
at the edges of the transport channels (i.e., nearer radial values of 15 nm) as opposed to the center
(i.e., at 0 nm). Empty NuPOD controls
confirm that these fluctuations are related to FG-nup fluctuations
(see Supplementary Figure 4). Our observations
indicate that the FG-nups spend more time clumped toward the inner-walls
of the NuPODs, rather than in the middle of the transport channel,
and that their rate of collective transitioning is recorded to increase
with faster line scanning. Furthermore, at equal scan speeds, the
more cohesive GLFG-repeat Nup100 tends to persist for longer before
transitioning when compared with the FxFG-repeat Nsp1.

Taken
together, these results show that, while no significant fluctuations
are detected inside the native NPC (Figure 2), stochastic changes in height are detected
for FG-nups inside the NuPOD system, persisting for up to ∼10
s (when scanned at slower line rates; see Figure 4A,D). This can be further confirmed by plotting
sample height at different locations in and around the pores as a
function of time (Figure 5). For the NuPOD system, fluctuations inside the channel exceed
those measured on and outside the pore scaffold by more than an order
of magnitude (Figure 5B,C), whereas, for the native NPC, no noticeable difference in the
magnitude of fluctuations is detected for different positions inside
and outside the transport channel (Figure 5A). It is plausible that the discrepancy
in behavior observed between the native NPCs and NuPODs (i.e., nonfluctuating and fluctuating behavior) is
due to the presence/absence of endogenous NTRs (present in the real
NPCs). In the preparation of native nuclear membranes from Xenopus laevis oocytes, the nuclei are repeatedly washed
to remove cellular material, including cargoes and NTRs, that may
be caught in transit. However, it is safe to assume that many NTRs
and possibly cargo molecules bound to the FG-nups will not be removed
by our washing steps.21 In the case of
the NuPODs, in the complete absence of NTRs, and in the symmetry of
the pore geometry, there are many different possible metastable conformational
states with small activation energy barriers between them, thus leading
to the observed fluctuating behavior. However, in the presence of
multivalent NTRs (such as importin-β),24 the FG-nups could wrap around these proteins, thereby becoming energetically
trapped in a given conformation (as was observed for FG-nups at low
grafting densities in planar films).25 To
this end, it would be interesting to acquire further kymograph data
of NuPODs in the presence of NTRs, presumably, upon addition of importin-β,
FG-nup fluctuations would stop. This experiment was attempted, but
the addition of importin-β at physiological concentrations (∼1
μM) disrupted the supported lipid bilayer in our experimental
setup.

structure; and orange- and green-dashed lines are different locations
inside the channel. These kymographs are also printed in Figures 2A and 3B,E. Color scales: 50 nm (A) and 20 nm (B and C).

Conclusions
We have shown that purified
FG-nups, grafted inside a cylinder,
interact collectively to form clumps that persist for ∼1 s
before transitioning. Furthermore, we show a subtle difference in
behavior between the FxFG-repeat Nsp1 and the more cohesive GLFG-repeat
Nup100, with Nup100 persisting for longer times before transitioning
(at comparable scan speeds; see Figure 4). While this result is expected,26 it further emphasizes the importance of cohesion—alongside
molecular-scale dynamics—to the collective behavior of the
FG-nups. For example, Nsp1, which adopts a more extended state than
Nup100,6 is nevertheless shown to form
clumps that can persist for several seconds before transitioning.
In the native NPC, however, the static appearance of the FG-nups is
probably due to the presence of other macromolecular contents (i.e., NTRs and cargoes) that interact with
the FG-nups and trap them in given morphologies.17,21

More generally, our results highlight several criteria that
can
be applied to facilitate the interpretation of nanometer-scale fluctuations
in time-resolved AFM data, especially of dynamic data obtained from
biological systems exhibiting a stochastic, rather than progressive
nature. First, data must be background corrected, referenced to stable
and flat areas of the sample (as is a common procedure for AFM images),
and, separately, corrected for lateral drift. Second, if fluctuations
are observed in the vicinity of protruding features on the sample,
additional controls are needed (e.g., the empty DNA scaffold control in Figure 3 to rule out any artifactual nature). Third,
to rule out white noise, dynamic features should be observed to persist
over multiple subsequent scan lines (in unfiltered data), such as
observed here in the kymographs recorded on NuPODs, and further articulated
by the autocorrelation analysis (Figure 3), demonstrating and quantifying the persistence
time of the observed molecular dynamics. Fourth, any such fluctuations
should be significantly larger than fluctuations at other, presumably
immobile positions on the sample (Figure 5). Finally, like any experimental method
that probes individual molecules, AFM is an invasive technique. To
identify the effect of the tip upon induced molecular dynamics, the
observed movements should be shown to be relatively robust against
variations in imaging parameters and/or speed (Figure 4).

Methods
NuPOD Sample
Preparation and AFM Imaging
NuPOD Assembly
DNA origami structures
and FG-domains
conjugated to DNA were prepared as previously described.5 These were stored at −20 and −80
°C, respectively. The NuPODs were assembled by mixing DNA-labeled
FG-nups with terminal MBP-tags in 7.5-fold excess (over the handle
number) to DNA origami cylinders in NuPOD buffer (1 × PBS, 0.1%
Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM MgCl2). After incubating
at 37 °C for 3 h, the sample was cooled to room temperature,
and TEV-protease added to remove the terminal MBP-tag from the FG-nups
now conjugated to the DNA rings. After a further incubation for 1.5
h, NuPODs were purified from excess protein by ratezonal centrifugation
through a glycerol gradient.

Preparation of Lipid Vesicles
1,2-Dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DPPC) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium
(bromide salt; DDAB) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. DPPC
and DDAB were mixed at a molar ratio of 3:1 in chloroform solvent.
Lipid vesicles were prepared by the extrusion method as described
elsewhere5 and stored at 4 °C for
up to 1 week. Briefly, the chloroform was evaporated under a stream
of nitrogen gas to yield a lipid film that was then redispersed with
sonication in Milli-Q water. The lipid vesicles were extruded through
a 100 nm polycarbonate filter (GE Healthcare Lifesciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK), and the extrusion process was repeated at least 20 times to yield
small unilamellar vesicles.

AFM Sample Preparation
2 μL of the lipid vesicles,
along with 1 μL of 1 M MgCl2, 1 μL of 1 M CaCl2, and 16 μL of Milli-Q water were deposited onto a freshly
cleaved mica disc. The disc was placed in a humid chamber and heated
to 65 °C for 10 min to induce vesicle rupture. The sample was
slowly cooled to room temperature over 20 min to form a gel-phase
supported lipid bilayer (SLB). Excess vesicles in the supernatant
were removed by rinsing first with water and then exchanged to imaging
buffer (10 mM PB 26 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0). The rinsing process
was repeated three to five times to ensure a clean and uniform surface
before addition of 2–4 μL of NuPODs (∼2–5
nM) prior to imaging. The DNA origami scaffold is electrostatically
adsorbed to the positively charged membrane.

AFM Imaging
All
AFM measurements were performed at
room temperature in liquid. Images were obtained using a Dimension
FastScan Bio AFM (Bruker) operated in Tapping mode. FastScan D (Bruker)
cantilevers were used for all imaging with a resonance frequency of
∼110 kHz, measured spring constant of ∼0.15 N m–1, and quality factor of ∼2 in water. The force
applied to the sample was minimized by setting the highest possible
amplitude set-point voltage, which was typically above 85% of free
oscillation close to the sample surface. Single line scanning experiments
provided an enhanced time resolution while minimizing disturbance
to the NuPODs. For these experiments, a single NuPOD was centered
and the frame size decreased to 120 nm before disabling the slow-scan
axis over the center of the pore. Where possible, data were collected
at 5, 10, and 20 Hz for each pore imaged.

Nuclear Envelope
Sample Preparation and AFM Imaging
Xenopus laevis Oocyte Nuclear Envelope Preparation
All experiments were
conducted on Xenopus laevis oocyte NPCs. The oocytes
were stored in modified Barth’s
solution (88 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 0.82 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM KCl, 0.77 mM CaCl2, and U/100 μg
penicillin/streptomycin, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for a maximum of 3 days.
The nuclei were isolated, and the nuclear envelopes were prepared,
in nuclear isolation medium (NIM) buffer (10 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 10
mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4), for AFM imaging as previously
described.17 The nuclei were kept in buffer
and on ice throughout the entire sample preparation, and no chemical
fixation or detergent was used at any stage.

AFM Imaging
All
AFM measurements were performed at
room temperature in import buffer (20 mM Hepes, 110 mM CH3COOK, 5 mM Mg(H3COO)2, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4).
Kymographs were obtained using a Dimension FastScan Bio AFM (Bruker),
using tapping mode AFM. FastScan D (Bruker) cantilevers were used
for all experiments, and the applied force was minimized (optimized)
as described for the NuPODs. Images of the nuclear envelope were recorded
to ascertain if the AFM tip probed the cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic
face of the nuclear envelope.17 A 300 ×
300 nm image at 304 samples/line of a single NPC was recorded; this
ensured capture of background nuclear envelope as well as the NPC.
When the position along the slow-scan axis was at the center of the
NPC (see Figure 1A,B,
AFM images, white-dashed lines), the slow scan-axis movement was disabled.
A kymograph was then produced with height in the fast-scan axis and
time in the slow-scan axis. The line rate was set to 5, 10, or 20
Hz, and the gains were optimized to best track the contours of the
sample.

Analysis Protocols
All data analyses were done using
MATLAB (MathWorks). The analysis code is accessible from GitHub: https://github.com/geostanley/AFM---Kymographs---Autocorrelation---DriftCorrection.

Concatenating Kymographs
A sequence of kymographs recorded
from one pore (NuPOD or NPC), at a given line rate, was loaded into
MATLAB, and the kymograph width (nm), samples/line, and line rate
(Hz) were entered manually. A first-order plane background subtraction
was applied to each kymograph individually to flatten the data with
respect to the background (either nuclear envelope or lipid bilayer).
If the Down Scan Only feature during data capture was not enabled,
the capture direction of the first kymograph was entered (up or down).
If the Down Scan Only feature was not enabled, the script vertically
flipped intermittent kymographs. If the Down Scan Only feature was
enabled, this step was skipped. All images were then vertically concatenated.
This yielded one large kymograph with height in the fast-scan axis
and time (as captured chronologically) in the slow-scan axis. A first-order
plane background subtraction was applied to the concatenated kymograph,
again using the background nuclear envelope or lipid bilayer.

Drift
Correction of Kymographs
The concatenated kymograph
was shown as a figure. The two outer edges of the scaffold (for either
the NuPOD or NPC) were selected manually. Windows (usually ∼10–20
nm in width) of kymograph data, centered around the two selected points,
were cropped. The height data within these two windows were averaged
to create a template. Each line (fast-scan axis) within the kymograph,
at the same window positions, was then compared with the template
using the sum of absolute differences (SAD) method, that is, the sum
of absolute difference in height values between all relevant pixels
was
calculated, with a lower SAD score meaning greater correlation. Each
line (or height array) was shifted in 1 nm intervals to both the left
and right by half the window width. The SAD score was calculated at
each position. Whichever position gave the lowest SAD score was considered
to have the best correlation with the template, and the height array
was moved to this position. If shifted, however, this resulted in
missing data points at one end of the height array (if a row was shifted
6 nm to the left, for example, there would be 6 nm of missing data
points at the extreme right end of the array). As it is assumed that
this region is either background lipid bilayer (for NuPODs) or background
nuclear envelope (for NPCs), these pixels were filled in with random
noise between the values of −1 and 1 nm. Schematics of this
routine, for both the NPC and NuPOD, can be seen in Supplementary Figure 2.

Autocorrelation Analysis
After drift correction, an
autocorrelation function was applied to the kymograph. This was defined
as in eq 1 in the Results and Discussion section. It should be noted
that it is possible to normalize R(τ) values
by dividing by the pixel’s variance (σ2).
This would give R(τ) values between −1
and 1, at each time-lag, for each pixel, in which −1 is perfect
anticorrelation and 1 is perfect correlation. However, to facilitate
a quantitative comparison between experiments (in which all will have
different σ2 values for each pixel), this was not
done. The R(τ) values were calculated for each
pixel for τ = Δt to τ = 100 s (or
until the maximum time of the kymograph if recorded for <100 s),
in increments of Δt.

To average autocorrelation
heatmaps, at a given line rate, from several NuPODs, the heatmaps
must be aligned spatially. This was done by selecting the two inside
edges of the scaffold structure as seen in the concomitant kymograph
(akin to the drift correction routine, in which both outer edges are
selected). These two values were used to define the center of the
kymograph (and thereby the center of their autocorrelation heatmaps).
All autocorrelation heatmaps were then aligned by this point, and
the R(τ) values 15 nm either side of this position
were cropped. All heatmaps to be averaged were then scaled by their
overall time contribution and then summed. The data were then binned
as a function of radial position and averaged to produce an autocorrelation
heatmap as a function of radius, with 0 nm being the center of the
channel and 15 nm approaching the inner-wall of the scaffold (see Figure 4).
