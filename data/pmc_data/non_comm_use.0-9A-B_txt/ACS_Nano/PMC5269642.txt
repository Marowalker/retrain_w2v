One-dimensional
semiconductor nanostructures, such as nanowires
(NWs), have attracted tremendous attention due to their unique properties
and potential applications in nanoelectronics, nano-optoelectronics,
and sensors. One of the challenges toward their integration into practical
devices is their large-scale controlled assembly. Here, we report
the guided growth of horizontal CdSe nanowires on five different planes
of sapphire. The growth direction and crystallographic orientation
are controlled by the epitaxial relationship with the substrate as
well as by a graphoepitaxial effect of surface nanosteps and grooves.
CdSe is a promising direct-bandgap II–VI semiconductor active
in the visible range, with potential applications in optoelectronics.
The guided CdSe nanowires were found to have a wurtzite single-crystal
structure. Field-effect transistors and photodetectors were fabricated
to examine the nanowire electronic and optoelectronic properties,
respectively. The latter exhibited the fastest rise and fall times
ever reported for CdSe nanostructures as well as a relatively high
gain, both features being essential for optoelectronic applications.

One-dimensional semiconductor
nanowires have been extensively studied in recent years, due to their
unique characteristics and properties compared with their bulk counterparts.1 One important property is photoconductivity in
which the electrical conduction increases under illumination.2 This phenomenon has been widely investigated
in bulk semiconductors since the middle of the previous century.3 Owing to their anisotropic geometry, small dimensions,
high crystallinity, and high surface-to-volume ratio,4 the photoconductivity of nanowires is expected to be superior
to that of bulk materials. In principle, since nanowires are characterized
by a relatively small effective conductive channel, the carrier transit
time is reduced, leading to photodetectors with fast photoresponse
and high photoconductive gain.5

One
major challenge toward the integration of nanowires into practical
planar devices in general, and specifically into photodetectors, is
their controlled large-scale assembly. In most cases, postgrowth processes
are required in order to integrate the nanowires into functional devices.
To this end, several methods have been devised, including the use
of electric6 and magnetic7 fields, fluidic alignment,8 Langmuir–Blodgett
technique,9etc. Although
extensive efforts have been made to improve these postgrowth methods,
their ability to control the position, direction, and length of each
nanowire, as required for parallel integration, is still limited.
Moreover, additional fabrication steps might damage the nanowires.

An alternative strategy for the large-scale integration of nanowires
is their direct guided growth with controlled orientations.10−17 In this bottom-up approach, the vapor–liquid–solid
(VLS) growth and the assembly of the nanowires are combined into one
single step, thus eliminating the need for postgrowth processes to
produce well-aligned horizontal nanowires as illustrated in Figure 1A. By applying the
guided growth approach, one can control not only the growth location
and direction but also the crystallographic orientation of the grown
nanowires. As demonstrated in Figure 1B, those parameters can be controlled by three guiding
modes: (a) epitaxial relationship between the wire and flat substrate,
as well as by a graphoepitaxial effect along surface, (b) nanogrooves,
and (c) nanosteps. Graphoepitaxy, in contrast to the more classical
commensurate epitaxy, usually refers to the incommensurate orientation
of crystals18 or periodic molecular assemblies19 by relief features of the substrate, such as
steps or grooves, which can be significantly larger than the lattice
parameter. This concept has been extended from inorganic materials
to the contexts of bock-copolymers19 and
colloidal self-assembly20 and more recently
to those of nanotubes21 and nanowires.12 Guided growth of nanowires can provide the high
crystallinity and quality required for high-performance optoelectronic
devices.22 This reproducible growth can
be easily combined with top-down lithography processes to fabricate
nanowire-based devices in a parallel manner on a large scale.23

In order to exploit the
guided growth approach for optoelectronic
applications, it must be extended to materials with wide coverage
of bandgap energies, especially in the visible range. Recently, our
group reported the guided growth of horizontal zinc selenide (ZnSe)
nanowires.22 It broadened the repertoire
of horizontal nanowires to a material with band gap energy in the
blue-UV range. However, a more compatible II–VI semiconductor
for optoelectronics is cadmium selenide (CdSe), with a direct bandgap
of 1.74 eV, and its absorption spectrum covers most of the visible
solar radiation range. Therefore, it has attracted great research
attention and has been considered promising in many fields24 especially for solar energy conversion and optoelectronic
applications.25 Recently, Penner et al.(26) reported a photodetector
based on nanocrystalline CdSe nanowires arrays showing fast response
times at a range of 20–40 μs but with relatively low
gain (0.032–0.050). For single-crystalline CdSe nanowires,
Wang et al.(27) reported
a photodetector showing rise and decay time constants of 34 and 230
μs, respectively. Other reports on single-crystal CdSe nanowires
show responses times at the millisecond scale.28−30 For other CdSe
nanostructures, such as nanobelts, shorter response times have been
achieved with a minimal value of 15 μs and high gain (∼102–103).5,31Table S1 summarizes those and other32−36 reported values for comparison with our results.

Here, we report the guided horizontal growth of single-crystal
CdSe nanowires and their parallel integration into photodetectors
with rise and fall times as short as 2 μs. These are, to the
best of our knowledge, the fastest photodetectors based on CdSe nanostructures
reported so far. Furthermore, the photodetectors showed relatively
high gain, in the order of 102. The guided growth is demonstrated
on five different flat and faceted planes of sapphire (α-Al2O3), displaying all the three modes of guided growth
previously described (Figure 1B). Using a focused ion beam (FIB), thin lamellas were sliced
across the nanowires and observed under a high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (HRTEM) to characterize the growth direction and
crystallographic orientation of the grown nanowires and their epitaxial
relation with the substrate. We also examined their optical properties
using photoluminescence (PL) measurement, and fabricated field-effect
transistors to characterize their electrical properties. Finally,
by fabricating nanowires-based photodetectors we measured the fast
optoelectric dynamics, and estimated their responsivity (Rλ), defined as the electrical output per optical
input, and their photoconductive gain (G), which
is defined as the ratio between the number of collected electrons
to the number of absorbed photons.

Results and Discussion
We studied the guided growth of horizontal CdSe nanowires on five
different planes of sapphire: three flat surfaces A(11̅20),
R(1̅120), and C(0001) to demonstrate epitaxy-governed growth
and two faceted surfaces to demonstrate graphoepitaxial growth, annealed
M (1̅010) with nanogrooves and annealed miscut C (0001) tilted
by 2° toward [11̅00] featured nanosteps. The synthesis
was carried out in a quartz tube within a two-zone horizontal tube
furnace. Au catalyst islands were patterned by photolithography followed
by either electron-beam evaporation of a thin (8 Å) layer and
dewetting at elevated temperature or by dispersion of purchased 10
nm nanoparticles. High-purity CdSe powder was the source for the two
precursors. It was placed in a quartz crucible which was heated and
kept at 800 °C in the middle of the first zone, while the sapphire
samples were placed downstream at the second zone. A mixture of 90%
N2 and 10% H2 was used as a carrier in a total
flow of 500 sccm. In a typical synthesis, the samples were heated
to 600 °C, and the pressure was set to 400 mbar. The synthesis
duration was 20–40 min; afterward, the furnace was allowed
to naturally cool down. The synthesis results were aligned by horizontal
growth of CdSe nanowires bound to the sapphire surface as well as
by vertical growth of CdSe nanowires from the catalyst islands. The
vertical nanowires were removed by 10 s of mild sonication in isopropyl
alcohol. The nanowires have a typical diameter of 60–120 nm,
and their length was up to 30 μm. All of the guided nanowires
had a wurtzite structure, with a stoichiometric ratio of Se and Cd
atoms (1.00:1.03), measured with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS, Figure S1). The crystallographic
orientation and the growth direction of the grown nanowires varied
with the different orientations of the sapphire substrates, as summarized
in Table 1, and detailed
in the next paragraphs.

Guided Growth
of CdSe Nanowires on Different Planes of Sapphire
On a flat
C (0001) sapphire, the guided CdSe nanowires grow along
six isomorphic M ⟨101̅0⟩ directions, as previously
was shown for GaN nanowires37 and ZnSe
nanowires,22 reflecting the 3-fold symmetry
of the substrate (Figure 2A). The growth axis of the nanowires is along two crystallographic
orientations [11̅00] and [11̅02]. In both cases, the plane
across the nanowire, which we refer to as transversal, is (112̅0),
and the transversal plane of the sapphire substrate is also (12̅10).
This means that the transversal mismatch is the same for both orientations
of growth, whereas the longitudinal mismatch is different, as summarized
in Table S2. This might imply that the
transversal mismatch is dominant in determining the crystallographic
orientation of guided nanowires as was previously suggested by Nikoobakht et al.(38) The nanowires that grow
along the crystallographic orientation [11̅00], are oriented
so that their c-axis perpendicular to the surface,
as was previously reported for CdSe films grown on C-plane sapphire.39 On annealed miscut C (0001) tilted by 2°
toward [11̅00], the CdSe nanowires are guided along the direction
of the L-shaped nanosteps, and their growth direction is ± [12̅10].
As already shown in all of our previous studies,12,13,22 graphoepitaxial guidance overrules the epitaxial
guidance. The crystallographic orientations of the nanowires on miscut
C-plane varied. This is not surprising, in the light of the findings
in our previous works, because they were guided by the nanosteps so
they had to simultaneously accommodate to two different planes of
the substrate.

Guided CdSe nanowires grow on
flat R (11̅02) sapphire along
four different directions ±[202̅1̅] and ±[02̅21̅],
separated by an angle of 94°. The nanowires grow along the polar
[0001] crystallographic orientation (Figure 2B). These results are similar to our previous
report for guided ZnSe nanowires.22

Another example of epitaxial growth was observed on flat A (112̅0)
sapphire. The guided CdSe nanowires grow along six directions separated
by around 60° angles, ±[4̅401], ±[2̅201̅],
and ±[1̅104] (Figure 2C). Four out of the six directions were previously
reported for ZnSe nanowires on the A plane at temperatures higher
than 700 °C.22 The nanowire crystallographic
orientation was [11̅00].

On a flat M (101̅0) sapphire,
horizontal growth of CdSe nanowires
was seen, but without specific preferred directions (Figure S3). However, since M sapphire is thermodynamically
unstable it undergoes faceting at elevated temperatures,40 and well-aligned graphoepitaxial growth is obtained
along the emerging nanogrooves (Figure 2D). The crystallographic orientation of the nanowires
on annealed M plane is not uniform, and three different growth orientations
were found: [12̅10], [12̅13], and [12̅12].

Optical
Characterization
Room-temperature photoluminescence
measurements were performed under excitation by a 532 nm laser (frequency-doubled
Nd:YAG) on a single CdSe nanowire grown on annealed M-plane sapphire
(Figure 3). The measurement
was done using a micro-Raman/micro-PL system (Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution).
Only a single peak is observed indicating high crystallinity of the
nanowire. The peak is centered around 710 nm, which is consistent
with the band gap of bulk CdSe (1.74 eV)41 and ascribed to the near band-edge emission of the nanowire, without
size quantization effects. Its full width at half-maximum (33 nm)
is relatively narrow compared to previous reports for single-crystal
CdSe nanowires,42 also indicating the high
crystallinity of the nanowire, although the peak has a slightly asymmetric
line shape, fitting to two Lorentzians give maxima at 711 and 696
nm, which is no more than 5 nm apart (Figure S5). It is not clear if this is due to two slightly different emissions
or a marginally asymmetric one. The small spikes around 690 nm belong
to the sapphire substrate. The fact that no size quantization (i.e., blue shift) is observed is consistent with the diameter
range (60–120 nm), which is much larger than twice the radius
of the Bohr exciton for bulk CdSe (5.4 nm).24 In principle, we could produce thinner nanowires in the quantum-size
regime by using small-diameter Au nanoparticles as catalysts, as previously
done in our group for ZnO nanowires.13

annealed M-plane sapphire, excited by 536 nm laser (black), and the
sapphire substrate (red).

Electrical Characterization
We characterized the electronic
properties of the horizontal CdSe nanowires by fabricating field-effect
transistors (FET) with top gates (Figure 4A inset). We chose samples grown on annealed
M sapphire because they have the strongest alignment and highest yield.
Due to the great control over the exact location and growth direction
of the nanowires, the FETs were fabricated using parallel steps only.
Each device was built on an array of ∼25 guided nanowires,
with an average diameter of ∼100 nm. Using photolithography
and electron-beam evaporation, Cr/Au (5/50 nm) electrodes were deposit
separated by 5 or 8 μm gaps. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was
used to deposit a 50 nm dielectric layer of Al2O3, followed by fabrication of Cr/Au (5/50 nm) gate electrode as described
previously. In Figure 4A, a typical two-terminal electrical measurement is shown, performed
by applying a source–drain bias (VSD) and recording the ISD – VSD curves at different gate voltages (Vg). The linear tendency at low VSD indicates that the contact between the electrodes and
the nanowires has an ohmic behavior within the measurement range.
Measurements at higher VSD ranges and Vg were also performed (Supporting Information) but often resulted in electrical breakdown. The
nanowires display n-type behavior, with charge carrier mobility (μ)
ranging from 10–2 to 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1. The mobility
was extracted from the transconductance (gm), as given by eq 1,
where L is the nanowire channel length and C is the capacitance, which was calculated using a quasicircular
cross-section approximation given by eq 2. Herein, ε and ε0 are the dielectric layer and vacuum permittivity constants,
respectively, h is the dielectric layer thickness,
and r is the radius of the horizontal CdSe nanowire.
The transconductance is estimated from the slope of the linear part
of the ISD – Vg curves. Actual mobility values may be higher if we could
eliminate the effect of contact resistance, since they were obtained
from two-terminal measurements (see the Experimental
Methods). The charge carrier concentration (ne) was calculated from the threshold voltage (Vth) using eq 3 and was found to be ne = (2.7 × 1018) – (4.8 × 1018) cm–3. Both our μ and ne values are in the range of those reported for other
CdSe nanowires.29,33,43 Specifically, reported μ values range between 1.9 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 (ref (43)) and 0.77
cm2 V–1 s–1 (ref (29)). These values are much
smaller than that of bulk CdSe,44 μ
= 650 cm2 V–1 s–1.
The mobility of semiconductor nanowires is often lower than that of
the bulk material by orders of magnitude due to surface scattering,
scaling roughly linearly with the nanowire diameter.45 Reports also show that the mobility of semiconductor nanowires
can be significantly increased by surface passivation.46 1   2   3

different bias voltages. The slope of the linear part of each curve

Optoelectronic Measurements
In order to characterize
the optoelectronic properties of the guided nanowires, we fabricated
photodetectors based on them. Each device was built on an array of
5–12 parallel nanowires by fabricating Cr/Au (5/50 nm) electrodes
with 5 μm gap. A typical device can be seen in Figure 5A. We used a 473 nm wavelength
laser to illuminate the samples and investigate the change in the
photocurrent at different laser powers and in dark (Figure 5B). As expected, in all measured
devices, the photocurrent increases with the increase in the laser
power density, revealing high sensitivity with on–off ratios
ranging (1.6 × 103) – (5.6 × 105), at 2 V bias, under illumination of 1.5 × 103 mW/cm2. Another important parameter in the characteristics of photodetectors
is the photoresponse speed. The rise time is defined as the time required
for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90%, and the fall time
is defined vice versa.47 To measure the expected fast response of the photodetectors, we
used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) to shift the laser beam on and
off the device, achieving fast laser reaction (<200 ns). The light-switching
frequency was controlled with a function generator. At 10 V bias and
with laser power densities higher than 100 mW/cm2, we measured
both rise and fall times in the range of 2–3 μs. In Figure 5C one on/off cycle
of a typical device with illumination power density of 520 mW/cm2 at 10 kHz and 2 V bias is displayed, revealing rise and fall
times of 2.3 and 2.5 μs, respectively. All of the devices show
high repeatability and stable results during the measurements, even
after a few months of storage.

based on CdSe guided nanowires.

were measured. The two electrodes are colored and marked. (B) I–V curves at different 473 nm laser

and fall (at 10 kHz, 2 V bias, and 520 mW/cm2). The fitting
curves for the single exponential rise and the biexponential decay
are marked in purple and green, respectively. (D) Reproducible on/off
switching (at 10 kHz, 10 V bias, and 1.5 × 103 mW/cm2). (E) Photocurrent as a function of the laser power density,
fitted with a simple power law I = APθ. (F) Rise and fall time as a function of the laser
power density (at 10 kHz, and 2 V bias).

Two other important parameters of a photodetector are its
current
responsivity (Rλ) and the photoconductive
gain (G). The responsivity is defined as Rλ= ΔI/PS, where ΔI is the difference between the photocurrent
(Iphoto) and dark current (Idark), P is the laser power density,
and S is the effective illumination area (estimated
by the electrode gap × nanowires diameter × number of nanowires).47 The photoconductive gain is defined as G = ℏcRλ/eλ, where ℏ is Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light, e is the electron
charge, and λ is the laser wavelength.47 In our measurements on 10 different devices, the responsivity ranges
from 14 to 347 A/W and the gain ranges from 36 to 911, corresponding
to previously reported values (Table S1). Both responsivity and photoconductive gain decrease with the increase
in the laser power density (Figure S7).
A simple power law function, Iphoto = APθ, is often fitted to the photocurrent
dependency on the laser power density,32 as demonstrated in Figure 5E. In this function, A is a constant depending
on the wavelength, and exponent θ determines the photocurrent
response to the laser power. The fitting curve for our data gave θ
equals 0.77, which fits well with previous publications for CdSe nanoribbons32 and nanowires.48 Since
we measure in a different wavelength than the other citations, our
similar results support that the photocurrent response to laser power
does not depend on the laser wavelength, as was suggested previously.32 This fractional power dependency, successfully
modeled by Rose,49,50 is attributed to a complex process
of electron–hole generation, trapping, and recombination within
the semiconductor. Rose suggested that the lifetime of a free carrier
becomes shorter at higher light intensities. When a semiconductor
material is illuminated, it is no longer in a thermal equilibrium
state, and two quasi-Fermi levels are induced: one for electrons and
another for holes. As the light intensity increases, these Fermi levels
are pulled apart toward their respective band edges, embracing more
ground states (states lying between the two quasi-Fermi levels). Then,
shallow trap states are converted to ground states and act as new
recombination centers causing a decrease in the lifetime of free carrier.
In Figure 5F the dependency
of the rise and fall times at increasing laser power is presented.
A clear decrease of the response times as a function of the laser
power density is observed, as predicted by the Rose theory. At laser
power densities higher than 300 mW/cm2, the rise and fall
times remain virtually unchanged, reaching a plateau. The photocurrent
tendency was further analyzed and fitted to exponential curves. The
rise region was well fitted to a single exponential: Iphoto = Iphoto,0[1 –
exp(−t/ τr)]. Here, Iphoto,0 is the maximum photocurrent, t is the time, and τr is the rise time
constant. The fall region was well fitted to a biexponential, Iphoto= Iphoto,0[exp(−t/ τd,fast) + exp(−t/τd,slow)], where τd,fast and τd,slow are two time constants for the fast and slow components
of the photocurrent decay, respectively. The exponential fitting curves
are marked in Figure 5C, with time constants equal to τr = 1 μs,
τd,fast = 1 μs, and τd,slow = 6 μs. The observation of two decay time constants may indicate
the existence of two different processes as implicit from the Rose
theory: fast recombination of free photocarriers and slower carrier
untrapping,

We attribute the fast response times of our photodetectors
not
only to the high laser power but also to the high crystallinity of
our nanowires, which reduces the number of traps states caused by
defects. To further examine and confirm the high crystallinity of
the guided nanowires, we cut a lamella along the nanowire growth axis.
As seen in Figure S8, the nanowires are
indeed single crystal, and only a few crystal defects were observed,
around one per micrometer. Another possible reason for our outstanding
results is directly related to the use of the guided growth approach:
since the nanowires grow in the same locations where they are later
integrated into devices, and minimal processes were carried out, they
remain chemically pristine and hence maintain their intrinsic performance
at the optimum. Furthermore, mechanical damage and adhered contamination
resulting from postgrowth processes are prevented.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the guided growth of aligned horizontal
CdSe nanowires on five different plans of sapphire. We characterized
their crystallographic structure and orientation as well as their
optical and electrical properties. The nanowires were found to have
wurtzite crystal structure, high crystallinity single crystal lattice,
and n-type behavior. Photodetectors based on these guided nanowires
were fabricated and examined, revealing fast optoelectronic response
and relatively high gains. These response times are the fastest among
all CdSe nanostructures based photodetectors reported so far. These
results demonstrate that guided nanowires are promising candidates
for high-performance optoelectronic applications. We attribute the
high performance of our CdSe nanowires to this growth approach resulting
in high-quality, single-crystal, aligned nanowires, which can be easily
assembled into devices without the need for postgrowth manipulation.

Experimental Methods
CdSe Nanowires Synthesis
CdSe nanowires were synthesized
in a home-built two-zone horizontal tube furnace via a VLS growth
process. CdSe powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was placed in the hot
center of the first furnace. Sapphire wafers coated with a photolithography
pattern of 8 Å evaporated gold or 10 nm gold nanoparticles (<12%
variability in size and shape, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as growth
substrates and catalyst and were placed downstream at the second zone
of the furnace around 40 cm away from the CdSe source powder. The
tube was initially pumped down to a base pressure of about 4–6
mbar. With the flow of 50 sccm hydrogen and 450 sccm nitrogen gases,
the hot center of the first furnace was heated to 800 °C and
the second furnace was held at 600 °C. Growth time was typically
20–40 min with a pressure of 400 mbar. After that, the furnace
was allowed to naturally cool down.

Structural Characterization
The morphology of as-grown
samples was observed by a scanning electron microscope (Supra 55VP
FEG LEO Zeiss). In order to analyze the crystallographic structure,
orientation, and epitaxial relationships of the nanowires, a focused-ion
beam (FIB, FEI Helios 600 dual beam microscope) was used to cut thin
(70–90 nm) lamellae across the nanowire, which were later observed
under a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI
Tecnai F30). The HRTEM images were analyzed using fast Fourier transform
(FFT) from selected areas across the nanowire, and the FFT peaks were
fitted to the crystallographic tables of bulk CdSe. Compositional
analysis was performed by STEM-EDS measurements on a FEI Tecnai F20
microscope.

Device Fabrication
A photolithography
mask compatible
with the catalyst pattern was used to define the electrodes pattern
and their gap. Cr/Au (5/50 nm) source/drain electrodes were deposited
over the guided nanowires, separated by 5 or 8 μm gaps, using
electron beam deposition. Up to this point, photodetectors were fabricated.
In order to fabricate the FET, a 50 nm dielectric layer of Al2O3 was deposited on the samples by atomic layer
deposition (Fiji TM) flowed by fabrication of a Cr/Au (5/50 nm) gate
electrode and repeated using the same fabrication steps.

Electronic
and Optoelectronic Measurements
Both the
electronic and optoelectronic measurements were done under vacuum
at room temperature using a Janis ST-500 probe system with a Keithley
4200-SCS. The electrical measurements were done under ambient light
conditions. In the optoelectronic measurements we used a 473 nm laser
to illuminate the devices, with power controlled by a metallic neutral
density filter (Thorlabs). An acousto-optic modulator (AOM) was used
to shift the beam on and off the device in order to perform on/off
measurements with a response time of <200 ns.
