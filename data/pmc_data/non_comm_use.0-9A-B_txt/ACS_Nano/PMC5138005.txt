Graphene
membranes act as highly sensitive transducers in nanoelectromechanical
devices due to their ultimate thinness. Previously, the piezoresistive
effect has been experimentally verified in graphene using uniaxial
strain in graphene. Here, we report experimental and theoretical data
on the uni- and biaxial piezoresistive properties of suspended graphene
membranes applied to piezoresistive pressure sensors. A detailed model
that utilizes a linearized Boltzman transport equation describes accurately
the charge-carrier density and mobility in strained graphene and,
hence, the gauge factor. The gauge factor is found to be practically
independent of the doping concentration and crystallographic orientation
of the graphene films. These investigations provide deeper insight
into the piezoresistive behavior of graphene membranes.

==== Body
Graphene,
with its high carrier
mobility,1,2 low mass, and high Young’s modulus
of over 1 TPa for both exfoliated and CVD graphene3,4 shows
great potential for future nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) applications.
Furthermore, graphene is stretchable up to 20% and allows for elastic
recovery.5 It adheres strongly to SiO2 substrates despite the fact that the bonding is primarily
based on van der Waals interactions.6 Graphene
is further impermeable to gases, including helium,7 and is therefore well suited for pressure sensor applications.
In previous work, we have introduced pressure sensors based on suspended
graphene membranes with direct electrical readout utilizing the piezoresistive
effect in graphene.8 In these sensors,
a pressure difference between the two sides of a suspended graphene
membrane deflects and strains the graphene. The rectangular shape
of the membrane with a high width to length ratio leads to uniaxial
strain. Due to the extreme thinness of the graphene membrane, the
sensitivity normalized by the membrane area of these sensors is significantly
higher than in conventional pressure sensors utilizing, e.g., silicon membranes. Extracted gauge factors of approximately 2–3
for uniaxial strain in graphene membranes match well with theory and
experimental results reported in literature.9−12 Preliminary results from experiments
with membrane geometries resulting in biaxially strained graphene
indicate similar gauge factors.13

This paper extends in experiment and theory the exploration of
graphene’s mechanical properties for use in high-sensitivity
piezoresistive nanoelectromechanical sensing. Simulations predict
that strain affects the electronic structure of graphene with a dependence
on the strain type (i.e., uniaxial, biaxial, or shear
strain).14−17 We measured different sensor geometries and performed corresponding
transport calculations using the linearized Boltzmann transport equation
(LBTE) to investigate the piezoresistive effect in graphene due to
uniaxial and biaxial (radial) strain. We present an improved model
that includes the charge carrier density in graphene to quantitatively
match the experiment. We establish that the gauge factor is independent
of the doping concentration. Both our experiments as well as the simulations
corroborate previous results and also suggest that graphene’s
piezoresistive behavior is independent of crystallographic orientation.
The piezoresistive behavior can be described as a superposition of
carrier density and carrier mobility modification, where the latter
dominates. We further demonstrate that, for small strain, graphene’s
intrinsic gauge factor is largely invariant of strain magnitude.

Results
Graphene pressure sensors were fabricated from chemical vapor deposited
(CVD) graphene transferred from a copper foil onto an oxidized silicon
substrate. The silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer is 1.5 μm
thick, with etched cavities that are 1.5 μm deep. Upon transfer,
the graphene covers the cavities and seals air at ambient pressure
inside. The graphene is contacted through gold electrodes that are
embedded in the SiO2 layer prior to graphene transfer and
is etched into patches using oxygen plasma. The graphene membranes
suspended over the cavities make up the active part of the graphene
patch. Figure 1a shows
a schematic of the device, Figure 1b shows the device concept, and Figure 1c depicts the fabrication process, with details
of the device fabrication described in the Methods.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of the pressure sensor used in this work. The red
area represents the active area of the device. (b) Representation
of membrane functionality in a graphene pressure sensor. As the pressure
outside the cavity varies, it causes a deflection and straining of
the graphene membrane, thereby changing its electronic properties.
(c) Fabrication process flow starting with SiO2 growth
on a silicon substrate followed by RIE cavity etching. Metal contacts
are then patterned followed by the transfer of graphene. The graphene
is patterned using a mask in combination with O2 plasma
etching. Finally, devices are wire bonded and placed into a chip package.
(d) Color-enhanced SEM of a sensor device with a rectangular graphene
membrane resulting in uniaxial membrane strain (upper image) and SEM
of a sensor device with a circular graphene membrane resulting in
biaxial membrane strain (lower image). In the SEMs, the graphene is
shaded in blue, the cavity in green, the electrodes and contact pads
in yellow, and the bond wires in orange. To the right of each color-enhanced
SEM is an SEM showing a close-up of the cavity region for the corresponding
devices.

When these suspended graphene
membranes are placed inside a pressure
chamber, the difference of the pressure in the sealed cavity and in
the pressure chamber causes the graphene membrane to deflect, thereby
applying strain (Figure 1b). Devices without cavities have been used for control measurements,
and they have been shown to have negligible sensitivity to pressure
changes8 (see the Supporting Information). Figure 1d shows two color-enhanced scanning electron microscope (SEM)
images of fabricated devices that have been wire bonded and packaged.
The graphene is shaded in blue, the cavities in green, the metal electrodes
and contact pads in yellow, and the bond wires in orange. The resulting
strain distribution in the graphene membranes is defined by the membrane
shape (i.e., the cavity shape). The top SEM in Figure 1d shows a rectangular
graphene membrane, which results in a near uniaxial strain distribution
in the membrane. The bottom SEM in Figure 1d shows a circular graphene membrane, which
results in a biaxial (radially symmetric) strain distribution in the
membrane. To the right of each image are higher resolution SEM images
with the respective cavity regions.

The strain levels in the
graphene membranes depend on the applied
pressure difference. The strain distribution and the strain levels
affect the electronic properties of the membrane, which can be quantified
by measuring the resistance of the graphene as it is strained. In
the experiments, the sensors were placed in a pressure chamber. Prior
to the measurements, the pressure chamber was evacuated and purged
repeatedly with inert argon gas to mitigate humidity and gas-sensing
effects in the graphene patch.8,18 The chamber pressure
was varied between 1000 mbar and a minimum of 100 mbar, the latter
to reduce the risk of rupture of the membrane or delamination of the
graphene from the SiO2 surface at the membrane edge. Delamination
has been shown to occur at strains on the order of MPa and so can
be reasonably neglected for the strain levels examined in this work.6 A Wheatstone bridge was used to measure the resistance
of the graphene, with the graphene patch acting as the variable resistor.
Before each measurement, the resistance of the bridge was calibrated
with a potentiometer after the pressure chamber was filled with Ar
to atmospheric pressure. Device self-heating effects from the biasing
current were kept to a minimum by limiting the bias of the Wheatstone
bridge to 200 mV square wave pulses with a length of 500 μs.
The voltage output signal of the Wheatstone bridge was then amplified,
passed through a low pass filter, sampled using an analogue-to-digital
converter, and finally converted into a corresponding resistance value.
The graphene membrane devices were compared to a control group of
devices that contained graphene patches without cavities (i.e., no suspended membranes) (see the Supporting Information). A capacitor model has been applied
to analyze the potential effect of capacitive coupling between the
suspended graphene membrane and fixed charges in the substrate. The
model predicts the resistance change in the graphene caused by capacitive
coupling with fixed charges in the substrate. The analysis indicates
that the effect of capacitive coupling on the device resistance is
very small in comparison to the piezoresistive effect (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 2a compares
the resistance response of a circular graphene pressure sensor with
a diameter of 18 μm over time with the readout of a commercial
digital vacuum transducer PDR 900 (MKS Instruments). The graph further
includes the average strain (in percent) in the graphene membrane
obtained by COMSOL modeling of the graphene deflection. This model
has been found to be reasonably accurate when compared to AFM measurements
of membrane deflection reported in literature.6−8 The strain-deflection
COMSOL model parameters are outlined in the Methods. The graphene patch resistance was measured repeatedly for the same
18 μm diameter membrane and is plotted as a function of the
calculated average strain in Figure 2b (blue circles). The data can be fitted linearly (red
line) in most measurement cycles, which matches well with the LBTE
simulations. This is significant because it will allow for simple
sensor calibration, even though in some cases the curves deviate from
being linear. We attribute this to parasitic effects, the nature of
which cannot be identified accurately in the experiment.

same device from (a). There is a linear relationship between changes
in resistance and strain which is predicted by linearized Boltzmann
transport simulations. (c) Percentage change in resistance of the
graphene membrane area for three devices with different membrane areas
as 18 μm diameter circular membrane (gray x), 24 μm diameter
membrane (blue diamonds), and 6 μm × 64 μm rectangular
membrane (orange dots). Results from corresponding simulations of
the percentage resistance change are shown for uniaxial strain (red),
corresponding to the rectangular membrane, and for biaxial strain
(blue), corresponding to a circular membrane. (d) Color-coded areas
of the resistors used for the equivalent resistance model for a device
with a circular membrane area (1) and rectangular membrane area (2).
(e) Extracted gauge factors of the different devices compared with
the simulation results for both uniaxial and biaxial strained graphene
membranes. Note that the gauge factors are constant regardless of
the membrane pressure and the membrane diameter for the circular membranes.

The data from Figure 2b were used to calculate the
change of resistance in percent (ΔR/R) of only the suspended part of the
graphene, i.e., the nanoelectromechanically active
membrane area (Figure 2c). An equivalent resistor network model of the graphene patch was
implemented (Figure 2d). Figure 2d shows
close up SEM images of the cavity regions of a 24 μm circular
membrane and a 6 μm × 64 μm rectangular membrane.
The colored regions indicate different resistor components used in
the model. The variable resistance of the suspended graphene membrane
is represented by R2, displayed in yellow.
For the circular membrane devices, the resistance of the membrane
region R2 is approximated by a square
region of equal area (Figure 2d-1) for simplicity. R2 can be
extracted through eq 1, with the assumption that only the resistance in the cavity region
changes with strain, while R1, R3, R4, and R5 remain constant and Rtot is the measured resistance of the graphene device as a
whole. Reference measurements of graphene patches with identical sizes
as the sensor devices, but without cavities, showed no change in the
resistance as a function of pressure. 1  

The resistor model
was applied to three different membrane shapes,
and the relative resistance change is plotted versus the average strain obtained from LBTE calculations (Figure 2c). The experimental data in Figure 2c stem from circular
membranes with a diameter of 24 and 18 μm (biaxial strain, blue
diamonds and gray x’s, respectively) and from rectangular membranes
with a size of 6 μm × 64 μm (uniaxial strain, orange
dots). One 24 μm device, one 18 μm device, and two 6 μm
× 64 μm devices have been investigated along with three
control devices which do not have a cavity8 (see the Supporting Information). The
latter ensures that the presence of a cavity is the driving force
behind the device’s pressure sensitivity. The percent change
in resistance for all devices was normalized with respect to the lowest
experimentally measured resistance. The linear fits to each measurement
also reflect their respective normalization.

Charge-transport
simulations have been performed to estimate the
expected percentage resistance change in the graphene membrane in
the case of both biaxial and uniaxial strain and are described in
detail in the Methods. The results from these
simulations are included in Figure 2c as red (biaxial strain) and blue (uniaxial strain)
dots. The calculated values are somewhat lower than the experimental
data. Figure 2e displays
the extracted gauge factors versus chamber pressure
for the three devices and the simulations from Figure 2c. For each device type, the gauge factor
is calculated by dividing the measured change in resistance of the
membrane area by the calculated average strain in the membrane. Each
device data set has been linearly fitted, and the linear fits of the
gauge factors remain nearly constant for all pressure levels and,
as a consequence, all strains (see the Supporting Information). The gauge factors for the two circular membranes
with biaxial (radial) strain are approximately equal. The experimental
gauge factors exceed the simulations. Although this discrepancy is
not fully understood, we attribute it to possible local defects and
grain boundaries present in the CVD graphene that have been shown
to result in higher gauge factors19 and
that are not present in the model. Another important outcome of this
study is that the gauge factor is independent of the applied strain
for all measured devices. Furthermore, the gauge factors of the two
circular membranes are very similar, i.e., nearly
independent of the cavity diameter. This is consistent with LBTE simulation
(see Figure 2d). However,
our simulations (see Figure 2d) as well as some reports in the literature (see Table 1) suggest that that
the gauge factor in uniaxially strained graphene (i.e., rectangular membranes) should be slightly higher than in biaxially
strained graphene (i.e., circular membranes). The
source for this discrepancy is not clear at this point but may be
a combination of other sources of influence, i.e., slight temperature variations, residual humidity, random grain
boundaries, or capacitive coupling (see the Supporting Information). Further, as the dominant mechanism in graphene’s
piezoresistivity is thought to arise from neutral defect scattering,
there may be a significant contribution from pseudospin flips induced
by scattering centers as proposed by Couto et al.(20) These additional phenomena have not
been considered in our model, may explain the discrepancy, and provide
an interesting motivation for future investigation.

We report simulated gauge factors
of 1.25 for biaxial strain and
2.20 for uniaxial strain. For experimental data, we report gauge factors
in graphene membranes of 6.73 for biaxial strain (circular membranes)
and 3.91 for uniaxial strain (rectangular membranes). These values
are in the same range as values reported in literature obtained with
different methods: Zhu et al. report a gauge factor
of 1.69 (biaxial), Huang reports 1.910 (uniaxial), Lee reports 6.111 (uniaxial), and Wang reports 212 (uniaxial), as summarized in Table 1. Our values are consistent with experimental and simulated
literature data, suggesting that the gauge factor of graphene very
likely resides in the range from 1.5 to 7.

The following theoretical
analysis discusses in detail the physical
origin of the observed gauge factors–specifically how strain
affects the charge transport in the graphene membrane. The strain
affects both carrier mobility and carrier density, as shown Figure
3a, which compares the magnitude of change in charge density with
that of the carrier mobility. From Figure 3a, the strain affects mobility and carrier
density in opposite directions with the latter partially compensating
the former. Details of the models are described in the Methods. The central message of the calculations is a resistivity
that is approximately proportional to the inverse of the squared Fermi
velocity: 2

density and mobility versus the differential pressure

to determine whether orientation of the graphene influences the resistance
change. (c) Electron mobility in a graphene membrane as a function
of the membrane radius. Note that the mobility decreases toward the
center of the membrane where strain levels are at a maximum.

The resistivity increases with
strain, since the Fermi velocity
decreases with strain.

An important feature of the piezoresistivity
of graphene is its
independence to changes in crystallographic orientation for small
uniaxial strain.8 This allows the possibility
of using randomly oriented membranes, such as one would expect from
CVD graphene, for strain sensor applications. Here, we also take into
account the strain distribution in a circular membrane, including
the membrane’s radius. In a circular membrane, the strain levels
are at a maximum at its center and the carrier mobility is at a minimum.
We have calculated the average mobility as a function of membrane
radius for three crystallographic orientations, namely armchair (60°),
zigzag (30°), and 45° (Figure 3b). Previously, our simulations assumed the
carrier density in the graphene membrane to be intrinsic (n = 1011 cm–2). However, CVD
graphene typically exhibits a much larger carrier density than graphene
under perfect conditions due to electrostatic doping effects, e.g., through the substrate. Therefore, a case of much higher
carrier concentration of n ≈ 3 × 1012 cm–2 was simulated with identical conditions, i.e., radial strain distribution with the largest strain
in the center of the membrane and strain directions of armchair (60°),
zigzag (30°), and 45°. The value of the carrier concentration
was chosen based on extraction from more than 4000 graphene transistor
devices fabricated in the same process flow as the sensors. Further,
this charge density value conforms well with previous literature.21,22 We find that the influence of the crystallographic orientation on
the device behavior is negligible, whereas the radius (and therefore
the strain magnitude) has quite a strong influence (Figure 3d).

The strong influence
of the radius on strain and resistivity is
also observed for highly doped graphene membranes (Figure 4a), while the gauge factor
is again independent of the direction of applied strain (inset of Figure 4a), as is the gauge
factor (Figure 4b).
This is important because our analysis suggests that neither large
variations in the doping concentration nor variations in the crystallographic
orientation of the graphene are expected to significantly affect the
gauge factor.

Figure 4 (a) Membrane resistance change (ΔR/R) versus radius of graphene membranes.
The strain model captures how the strain increases toward the center
of a membrane (radius of 0 μm). This was performed for armchair
(yellow circle), zigzag (blue triangle), and 45° (red square)
directions based on (c). Virtually no impact on the orientation is
observed. Inset: gauge factors extracted for the different orientations.

high graphene doping (red and blue, respectively). Doping has virtually

pressure sensor calculated with a refined COMSOL model. (d) Comparison
of gauge factors extracted from the simulation in (c) using the simplified
resistance model, described in the Supporting Information (red) compared to the gauge factor extracted from
charge transport simulations in Figure 2d. Note that the simplified resistance model provides
very close gauge factor estimation supporting the conclusion that
the simplified resistance model gives a very good approximation of
the gauge factor.

So far, as in previous
studies,8,13 gauge factors
have been extracted using a simplified resistor network model (see
above) in combination with a COMSOL model that calculates the strain
in a graphene membrane for a given deflection (due to pressure differences
acting on the device). Here, a refined finite element model is introduced.
This model incorporates LBTE simulations to calculate the charge carrier
density and mobility for a given strain at each element of the mesh
defined over the graphene membrane. In addition, the model is used
to simulate the entire patch region of the graphene, not just the
membrane area. This allows the calculation of the total patch resistance
and its comparison to experimental data. The improved model further
includes doping effects, as previously discussed. LBTE simulations
predict a linear relationship between strain and resistivity for small
strain. The predicted resistance of an entire graphene patch with
an 18 μm diameter circular membrane is approximately 1.05 kΩ,
close to the measured value of 1.1 kΩ. In the improved model,
a charge carrier density of n0 = 3.5 ×
1012 cm–2 and a mobility of 1000 cm2 V–1 s–1 were assumed.
Both values were chosen based on extracted values from 4500 graphene
transistors fabricated using the same process flow as the sensors
and using an established extraction method.23 The values further agree well with previous literature for both
the carrier density21,22 as well as the mobility.24−26 The spatial distribution of the strain induced resistivity change
of the corresponding graphene patch is shown in Figure 4c. Using this model for the entire graphene
patch, the simplified resistor model was employed to extract gauge
factors from the refined model, and the resulting gauge factors were
compared to the LBTE based model. Even though the simplified model
cannot be used to predict the resistivity of a graphene patch, it
can be used to calculate accurately the gauge factor of the sensors
from electrical measurements (Figure 4d). The refined model, in contrast, allows gauge factor
predictions on its own. Through comparison of the LBTE gauge factor
extraction to the simplified model extraction, we confirm that the
simplified model provides a high precision approximation of the device’s
gauge factor.

Conclusions
Graphene behaves somewhat
differently depending on whether it is
strained biaxially or uniaxially. The gauge factors extracted in this
work fall within the range of values reported by previous literature
and remain unchanging along different pressure ranges, as predicted
by theory. Although simulation predicts that biaxial strain will produce
slightly lower gauge factors than uniaxial strain, in our experiments
the biaxial strained devices consistently had higher gauge factors
than uniaxially strained, which suggests that there may be mechanisms
at work which are not fully understood. Further, simulations suggest
that neither the crystallographic orientation of the graphene nor
the doping concentration significantly affects the gauge factor for
the strains examined. Also, the validity of device gauge factor extraction
using a simplified resistance model approximation is affirmed.

Methods
Devices were fabricated
on predoped silicon substrate with p-type
phosphorus doping. A layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) was
thermally grown (Figure 1c-1). Next, rectangular and circular cavities of different sizes
were etched into the SiO2 layer at a depth of 1.5 μm
using a resist mask and reactive ion etching (RIE) with Ar and CHF3 as etch gases at an electromagnetic field power of 200 W
and a gas pressure of 40 mTorr. Figure 1c-2 shows an example of a circular cavity with a diameter
of 24 μm. Long rectangular cavities result in near uniaxial
strain in the graphene membrane. In contrast, circular cavities result
in biaxial strain in the graphene membrane spanning over the cavity,
with a radial gradient. RIE was used to etch 640 nm deep holes into
the SiO2 layer for contact electrodes and bond pads. These
holes were then filled with a 160 nm thick layer of Ti to act as an
adhesion layer and a 500 nm thick contact layer of gold (Figure 1c-3). The purpose
of realizing the contact electrodes before the graphene transfer is
to limit the number of fabrication steps after the graphene is transferred,
as the membranes are extremely fragile. Further, photoresist residue
is known to contaminate the surface of graphene when using standard
lithography processes after graphene transfer. By placing the metal
electrodes underneath the graphene, we ensure that there is no residue
between the electrodes and the graphene layer. Next, graphene is transferred
to the preprocessed substrate (Figure 1c-4). Chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene grown
on copper foil from a commercial vendor (www.graphenea.com) was used.
A layer of poly(bisphenol A) carbonate (PC) was spin coated onto the
surface of the graphene. This polymer film acts as a carrier to transport
the graphene from the initial copper foil to the target substrate.26−30 Carbon residues on the backside of the copper foil were then etched
using O2 plasma. The exposed side of the copper foil was
placed into a solution of FeCl3 to etch the copper foil,
leaving a free-floating graphene membrane on the polymer sheet. The
graphene was then fished out of the solution using the target substrate
and placed into HCl and DI water in order to clean away Fe ions.31 Next, the substrate/graphene stack was placed on a hot plate at 45
°C for 10 min. This was done in order to improve the adhesion
between the graphene and the substrate. After heating, the substrate
was allowed to cool before leaving it in a solution of chloroform
for about 18 h to remove the polymer layer on the graphene. The graphene
was selectively etched using O2 plasma in combination with
a standard photolithography mask (Figure 1c-5). Once the devices were completed, they
were wire bonded into a ceramic chip package to facilitate measurements
in a vacuum chamber. Figure 1c-6 shows a photograph of the chip package, and Figure 1d shows two color-enhanced
SEMs, one of a sensor with a rectangular graphene membrane and another
one of a sensor with a circular graphene membrane. Raman spectroscopy
and electrical measurements were performed on similarly transferred
devices to verify the presence of graphene (see the Supporting Information).

Simulations of the strain and
deflection for different membrane
areas were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics and were found to match
well with literature data.8,32 The model is comprised
of isotropic, linearly elastic 2D plates, which are clamped along
the cavity boundary. The material parameters used in the model are
as follows: Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.16,
elastic constant Et =
347 N/m (based on Koenig et al.),6 and t is the membrane thickness (t = 0.335 nm).

Charge transport simulations were performed
using the LBTE approach,
which assumes a vanishing electric field in the transport direction,
and either for an intrinsic graphene condition, corresponding to a
Fermi level at Dirac point (EF = 0 eV),
or for a graphene electron concentration of about 3.1 × 1012 cm–2, corresponding to EF ≈ 0.175 meV. The resistance of a given graphene
membrane region is then defined by eq 3 3  where ρ respresents the resistivity
of the membrane region, Ne is the electron
density, and μe is the electron mobility. At the
Dirac point, both the electron and hole density and mobility are the
same. εxx and εyy are strain components in the x and y directions of the membrane region. Furthermore, q is the fundamental unit of charge, and L′ and Wt′ are the length
and width change of the device as it is strained. As can be seen by eq 3, the resistance of the
graphene membrane R2 can change due to
a change in several factors: charge density, carrier mobility, and
device geometry as a result of a deflection of the graphene membrane.
None of these possible effects can be neglected a priori. Since anisotropic strain leads to anisotropic energy dispersion
relations, we have employed a recently developed general approach
for the deterministic solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport
equation,33 and we used it to relate the
effect of strain on the electron mobility μe. This
approach can naturally handle anisotropic energy dispersion relations
and scattering rates, allowing us to accurately estimate the dependence
of the resistance R2 on the variation
of the strain tensor or on the alignment between the transport direction
and the graphene orientation. In order to gain an intuitive insight
in the results of numerical simulations, we here develop a simplified
analysis and assume that the shear strain components are negligible
and the strain tensor takes the simple form of eq 4. 4  

The energy dispersion relation E(k) near the Dirac energy remains linear
and isotropic also in the
presence of strain. Hence, E(k)
can be still expressed by eq 5, where vF(ϵ) is the Fermi velocity, that
depends on the strain. 5  

Fermi velocity will decrease
with the strain, which implies that
for a given energy the magnitude k of the wave vector
is larger for strained graphene than in relaxed graphene. As a consequence,
the density of states increases with the strain because it is approximately
proportional to the inverse of the squared Fermi velocity: 6  

An increase
of the carrier density leads to a decrease of the resistance R2 (see eq 2), and this behavior is not consistent with the results from
our experiments. Hence, a simple charge-based analysis does not explain
the dependence of the resistance on the strain. For this reason, we
have to analyze also the dependence of the mobility on the strain.
If we suppose that the neutral defects34 are the predominant scattering mechanism in CVD graphene35 and if we model their scattering rate with the
expression presented in,34 it is possible
to demonstrate that the dependence of the mobility on the Fermi velocity
is given by eq 7. 7  

The mobility therefore decreases with the strain, leading to an
increase of the resistor R2 (see eq 2).
