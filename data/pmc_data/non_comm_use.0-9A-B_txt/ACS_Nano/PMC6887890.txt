Polymersomes are
a class of artificial liposomes, assembled from
amphiphilic synthetic block copolymers, holding great promise toward
applications in nanomedicine. The diversity in polymersome morphological
shapes and, in particular, the precise control of these shapes, which
is an important aspect in drug delivery studies, remains a great challenge.
This is due to a lack of general methodologies that can be applied
and the inability to capture the morphologies at the nanometer scale.
Here, we present a methodology that can accurately control the shape
of polymersomes via the addition of polyethylene
glycol (PEG) under nonequilibrium conditions. Various shapes including
spheres, ellipsoids, tubes, discs, stomatocytes, nests, stomatocyte-in-stomatocytes,
disc-in-discs, and large compound vesicles (LCVs) can be uniformly
captured by adjusting the water content and the PEG concentration.
Moreover, these shapes undergo nonequilibrium changes in time, which
is reflected in their phase diagram changes. This research provides
a universal tool to fabricate all shapes of polymersomes by controlling
three variables: water content, PEG concentration, and time. The use
of the biofriendly polymer PEG enables the application of this methodology
in the field of nanomedicine.

==== Body
Cell shape
is of key importance
in cell growth and cell differentiation and, as such, has been crucial
in the evolution of life. For instance, it is important in the morphogenesis
of tissue during the development of the living body. Furthermore,
it may help a species escape from its predators.1 The dynamic assembly of the cytoskeleton is the result
of out-of-equilibrium reactions in the cell and is accompanied by
shape changes, which are needed for environmental adaptation.1 Out-of-equilibrium assemblies are systems that
require a continuous supply energy to persist. If the energy supply
stops, the system would fall apart and end up in a thermodynamic minimum
state nearby.2−4 Liposomes can spontaneously exhibit various shapes,
which are reminiscent of biological cell morphologies, which have
inspired scientists to fabricate vesicles (synthetic liposomes) of
different shapes and compositions as cell mimetic systems in order
to understand the mechanism of liposomal shape change.5 Variations in mechanical stress, temperature, pH, or osmotic
shocks and in membrane composition are capable of inducing drastic
changes in liposomes, ranging from nearly spherical shapes to discocytes,
stomatocytes, starfish, or pears.6,7 However, the
dynamic nature of the phospholipid membrane makes these shape transitions
transient due to the lack of stabilization by the cytoplasm in the
cell and the fact that the cytoskeleton has glassy properties, limiting
an accurate shape control.

Polymersomes assembled from amphiphilic
synthetic block copolymers
demonstrate enhanced membrane stiffness and provide great possibilities
for tailoring both the chemical design of the membrane and its physical
properties (such as stiffness, zeta-potential, and adhesiveness),
which allows for good control over the shape and function of the aggregate.8−16 The shape of a polymersome is expected to affect its interaction
with the cell, which is important for its flow properties, its cellular
uptake, and immune regulation, as is the case for the biconcave disc-like
red blood cell.17−21 Therefore, it is of great importance to be able to accurately reshape
a polymersome and to understand the mechanism of the interconversions
of the various shapes. Several studies have explored the possibilities
to reshape polymersomes via osmotic pressure or a
change in chemical structure.22−35 Block copolymers bearing liquid-crystalline side chains assembled
to ellipsoids, tubes, and polyhedral shapes of polymersomes via solvent control.33,34 Spherical polymersomes,
assembled from poly(ethylene glycol)-block-polystyrene
(PEG-b-PS) block copolymers, deflate into flat discs
and bowl-shaped stomatocytes via dialysis of the
polymersome suspensions in mixtures of organic solvents against pure
water, leading to a decrease of the inner volume of the aggregates.29 Chemical cross-linking of the polymersomes induced
a shape transformation from spheres to rods.36 Our group has previously reported on the shaping of polymersomes
into predictable morphologies via nonequilibrium
self-assembly with the objective to mechanistically understand and
predict polymersome shape changes to low-energy states. Unfortunately,
only a few morphologies, such as discs, rods, and stomatocytes, were
observed.37 Hence, a complete overview
of the shape transformations of polymersomes and their transition
from low to high energy states in order to capture unique morphologies
in the nanometer range that have not been observed before is still
lacking.

Herein, we report a new nonequilibrium methodology
to transform
spherical PEG-b-PS polymersomes into a variety of
shapes, such as rods, tubes, discs, stomatocytes, nests, disc-in-discs,
stomatocytes-in-stomatocytes (sto-in-sto), and large compound vesicles,
which can be kinetically trapped at any stage of their transformation.
Our former approach for obtaining a controlled shape transformation
was only based on osmotic pressure changes to push further the polymersome
transformation beyond the low-energy stomatocyte state to generate
other shapes.37 In the present methodology,
we combined additives, time, and nonequilibrium conditions as parameters
for shape control. The polymersomes are initially formed by adding
water to a block copolymer solution in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran
(THF) and dioxane. Our approach for obtaining a controlled shape transformation
is to ensure that the polymersomes only experience one single equilibrium
state at the moment they are formed. Extra addition of water pushes
the polymersome out of osmotic equilibrium by storing energy in the
membrane. The membrane flexibility and permeability can be tuned by
the water fraction in the polymersome solution, which is possible
because of the amorphous glassy nature of the PS part. The PS membrane
used in our studies is composed of 230 repeating units, which limits
its mobility, resulting in much longer transition time scales (i.e., on the order of hours) than in the case of liposomes
(seconds). This prolonged time scale gives the possibility to kinetically
trap every intermediate morphology by freezing the PS membrane via quickly adding excess water. The use of PEG as a fusogen
has been recently demonstrated by our group, and its ability to induce
a shape change in the polymersome can already be realized with a trace
amount (0.005 wt %) of this compound, compared to >15 wt % for
the
liposome system, which is possible because the low permeability of
the membrane amplifies the osmotic pressure.31 In this paper, we show that the bending energy of the polymersome
can be regulated by tuning the rigidity of the PS membrane, allowing
good control of the nonequilibrium shape transformation and the possibility
to capture various morphologies over time, leading to a complete phase
diagram of the shape transformations.

Results and Discussion
Self-Assembly via Water Addition
Polymersomes
were made by first dissolving 10 mg of PEG45-b-PS230 in 1 mL of THF/dioxane = 4:1 (v/v), followed by
slowly adding water at a rate of 1 mL/h (Figure 1a,b). The assembled polymersomes were formed
when the ratio of water and organic solvent approached 1:4 (v/v).
At this point, the solvent compositions inside and outside the polymersomes
are equal (i.e., the inner and outer osmotic pressures
are equal), setting this as the equilibrium point. Continuous addition
of water into the solution will push the self-assembled system to
nonequilibrium as an osmotic pressure builds up over the membrane.
The extra water addition makes the PS membrane more rigid and less
permeable. As previously observed,21 when
the water content is 50 vol %, most of the spherical polymersomes
change into rods after 4 days because the organic solvent flows out
faster than water flows in, resulting in a volume decrease. The system
changes back to a spherical morphology after 8 days (inflow of water
releases the bending energy), indicating that the nonequilibrium shape
change is driven by osmotic pressure. However, the increase of water
addition leads to an increase of the membrane rigidity and a decrease
of the permeability, which limits the range over which the osmotic
pressure can be built up. This small range indicates that only very
limited morphologies (rods, discs, and stomatocytes) are accessible
with this method. Furthermore, the flexibility and mobility of the
polymer chains are considerably reduced, preventing spontaneous curvature
from changing and membrane fusion from taking place.

g/L. (d) All of the shapes show different equilibrium behavior over

Shape Transformation via PEG Addition
To explore new paths of polymersome
shape change, PEG was selected
for enhancing the osmotic pressure and the interaction with the polymersome
membrane, as it has been demonstrated before to act as a fusogen of
liposomes due to its osmophobic association effect.38 This effect demonstrates that the PEG molecules are excluded
from the region adjacent to the lipid vesicle surface (exclusion layer),
which induces osmotic stress onto the vesicles, resulting in membrane
fusion. Based on our previous report,29 PEG with a molecular weight of 2000 was chosen as the fusogen as
relatively large molecules can be excluded more effectively from the
exclusion layer adjacent to the membrane surface than small molecules,
which is seen as the “mechanical stress model”.39 As shown in Figure 1b, when the volume of water reached a certain
value (0.3–2 mL), 200 μL of the polymersome suspension
was transferred to a centrifuge tube, followed by the addition of
10 μL of an aqueous PEG2000 solution to the suspension. The
shape of polymersomes immediately changed to a variety of morphologies
depending on the PEG2000 concentration and water content (Figure 1c). We expect that
the added PEG2000 polymer molecules in the solution will mostly stay
outside of the polymersome membranes due to their inability to penetrate
the thick hydrophobic PS membranes. This PEG addition procedure pushes
the polymersomes even further away from the equilibrium situation
when compared to the experiments in which only water is added. The
morphology was fixed by quenching 200 μL of polymersome solution
with 1 mL of water for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement.
All shapes that were captured are presented in Figure 2, together with the preparation conditions,
such as water content and PEG2000 concentration that were used for
the shape transformation. This information on the morphologies was
used to construct a phase diagram, which is shown in Figure 3. The solid line in this figure
means that only one type of shape was observed in the particular region,
and the dashed line is a mixture of both shapes.

the ones in the phase diagram in Figure 3. Scale bar: black, 1 μm; white, 500
nm.

Figure 3 Phase diagram of polymersome morphologies before
equilibrium. The
points in the picture correspond to the images in Figure 2. The solid line means that
only one shape is observed in the region; the dashed line means a
mixture of two shapes in that area. The red line is defined as being
the threshold concentration line for fusion.

The observed morphology changes can be categorized into two classes:
(i) shape transitions with membrane fusion and (ii) transitions without membrane fusion, mainly depending
on the PEG2000 concentration. When the PEG2000 concentration was above
a threshold value (see the upward pointing line of the nested vesicles
in the phase diagram; Figure 3, red line), the membranes started to fuse, forming nested
vesicles, stomatocyte-in-stomatocytes (sto-in-stos), discocyte-in-discocytes
(disc-in-discs), and large compound vesicles (LCVs) (Figure 2f–i). Below the PEG2000
threshold value, the membranes remained stable, forming ellipsoids,
tubes, discs, and stomatocytes (Figure 2b–e). The different shape changes can be explained
in terms of osmotic pressure and membrane permeability.

Spherical
shapes (Figure 2a)
are stable and sustained in the region of the phase diagram,
where the PEG2000 concentration remains below 0.01 g/L and the water
content is low (the situation of a highly permeable membrane) because
such PEG concentrations generate very small osmotic pressures, which
can easily equilibrate due to the high permeability of the membrane.
Spherical shapes are also found at high PEG2000 concentrations and
high water contents (the situation of a low permeable membrane) when
the rigid membrane prevents water and organic solvent to leak out.
A slight increase of the PEG2000 concentration at low water content
leads to an increase in the induced osmotic pressure, resulting in
a shape transformation from sphere to ellipsoid. The ellipsoid shape
will gradually elongate to a tube by continuous increasing the osmotic
pressure and water content. In the region of high organic solvent
content (leading to a membrane with high permeability and low rigidity),
the osmotic pressure is high enough to increase the curvature, meanwhile
pushing much more organic solvent out, resulting in a shape transformation
to stomatocytes. In the region of low organic solvent, the shape changes
to a disc as it requires a higher bending energy for the transformation
to a stomatocyte, whereas only a small volume of organic solvent is
available to leak out. As can be seen in Figure 3, stomatocytes are obtained over a large
region and are well under control as they are situated at the lowest
energy state. Moreover, we found that the size of the opening of stomatocytes
can be manipulated by adjusting the water content. As shown in Figure S1, the average diameters of the open
mouth of the stomatocytes decreased from 414 to 177 nm and further
to 21 nm when the water content fell from 60 to 50 vol % and then
to 33.3 vol %.

Nested shape structures were formed when, with
the assistance of
the PEG2000, a larger reduction of the inner volume was possible,
coupled with a fusion of the mouth. During this fusion process, a
part of the PEG2000 solution would be entrapped inside the nested
shape, leading to an increase in the organic solvent content. Higher
osmotic pressure will push the organic solvent out for the second
time, forming a disc-in-disc shaped structure. As demonstrated in
the phase diagram, this disc-in-disc shape possesses a high bending
energy, hence, capture of such morphologies is only possible when
the membrane is relatively rigid. When the membrane is too flexible
(water content 23 vol %), these disc and disc-in-disc shapes are not
obtainable; instead, stomatocytes and sto-in-sto shapes are formed
directly. If the concentration of PEG2000 is greater than 10 g/L,
the polymersome corona cannot be stabilized by electrostatic and steric
effects, leading to membrane fusion and to large compound vesicles.
Shorter PS chain (PEG45-PS190) polymersome transformed
to similar shapes as PEG45-PS230 at the same
concentration (Figure S3), but the PEG45-b-PS160 polymersome membrane
is too flexible to be fused to irregular shapes even at low PEG2000
concentrations (Figure S2).

Equilibration
after PEG Addition
The process after
PEG addition continuously induces a shape change until equilibrium
is reached (Figure 1d). This shape change mainly involves three processes. First, after
the first balancing of the osmotic pressure, the polymersome will
reinflate by the simultaneous inflow of water and organic solvent
to decrease the bending energy, while maintaining the osmotic balance.
Second, PEG molecules diffusing in and out of the polymersome will
continuously assist in the fusing/aggregation of the polymersomes.
Third, the polymer chains will rearrange in order to release the bending
energy. These three factors synergistically work on the self-assembled
system through a nonequilibrium process via different
morphologies to adapt to the minimum energy path. Figure 4a,b presents the phase diagram
change after 2 days and 30 days. At low water content, the membrane
is flexible and slightly permeable to water, allowing inflow of both
water and organic solvent, resulting in the shape transformation from
long/narrow tubes (∼5 μm long) to shorter/wider tubes
(∼2 μm long). The shorter/wider tubes cannot transform
back to spheres because they reached the kinetic equilibrium state
(Figure 4c). As the
shape change from sphere to disc is discontinuous, the excess energy
generated from the osmotic pressure is stored in the PS membrane via polymer chain tension. This tension is then slowly alleviated
in time by chain rearrangements, which can also be seen as bending
energy. Thus, a high concentration of PEG creates a high osmotic pressure,
which flattens the polymersome to a disc shape. The extra bending
energy can be slowly released via a shape change
to stomatocyte (Figure 4d). In the same context, but when PEG is present in high concentration
and the membrane is plasticized by the large amount of organic solvent,
all morphologies, such as sto-in-sto, disc-in-disc, and nest shapes,
equilibrate to large composite vesicles, due to the interaction of
PEG with the membrane of the polymersome (Figure 4f). Smaller PEG concentrations and a highly
flexible membrane will push the stomatocytes to form multiopened stomatocytes
(Figure 4e). Furthermore,
once the membranes are fused together, it is impossible at this condition
to separate them back to polymersomes again, which would need the
system to overcome extremely high surface energies.

in Figure 2, the long
tubes (c), discs (d), stomatocytes (e), and nests (f) change to short/wide
tubes, multiopened stomatocytes, and LCVs, after equilibration times
of 2 days and 30 days. The colors match the labels in Figures 2 and 3. Scale bar: 1 μm.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a universal
methodology for reshaping
nanometer-scale polymersomes into various new morphologies in a controllable
manner via PEG-guided nonequilibrium self-assembly.
Furthermore, we have constructed the complete phase diagrams of all
transitions. Each of the produced morphologies is highly uniform,
and the structures are fully reproducible, including the stomatocyte
openings, which can be strictly controlled. The latter is of great
importance and can be used as a soft method for encapsulation purposes
(e.g., of drug molecules). All structures started
from a spherical morphology and transformed to various shapes via different routes whose mechanisms have been investigated.
Low concentrations of PEG2000 below the threshold concentration (red
line in Figure 3) induce
only osmotic pressure over the membrane, resulting in the transition
from the spherical shape to ellipsoid, tube, disc, and stomatocyte.
Above the threshold concentration, PEG2000 not only creates a high
osmotic pressure but also acts as a fusogen of the membrane due to
the effect of osmophobic association, which assists the shape change
to nest, sto-in-sto, disc-in-disc, and LCV. The rigidity of the membrane,
which is tuned by the ratio of water and organic solvent regulates
the path of the shape changes and the kinetics, allowing each shape
during the transformation to be to captured in time spans varying
from hours to days. We demonstrated that all of these shape transformation
procedures are kinetic traps and nonequilibrium at short time scales.
The kinetic pathway strongly depends on parameters such as the organic
solvent (THF and dioxane) type, ratio, and water content, as well
the added PEG2000. These differently shaped polymersomes are promising
candidates for applications as nanocontainers or nanomachines. As
we already demonstrated, the nonbiodegradable PS could be replaced
by other biodegradable polymers such as poly(d,l-lactide), which exhibits a similar glassy behavior at room temperature
as PS, offering opportunities for the practical application of the
aggregates in drug delivery.

Experimental Methods
Materials
All reagents and chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Milli-Q water (18.1 MΩ)
was used throughout the experiments. The molecular weights of the
block copolymers were measured with a Shimadzu Prominence GPC system
equipped with a PL gel 5 μm mixed D column (Polymer Laboratories)
and differential refractive index and UV (254 nm) detectors. THF was
used as an eluent with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. NMR spectra were performed
on a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as a solvent.
Transmission electron microscopy samples were prepared in the following
way: a solution of a sample (6 μL) was air-dried on a carbon-coated
Cu TEM grid (200 mesh). A TEM JEOL 1010 microscope at an acceleration
voltage of 60 kV was used to perform the measurements. A sonicator
VWR USC300TH was used for the sonication experiments at room temperature.
A JEOL 2100 cryo-transmission electron microscope was used for a detailed
characterization. PEG-b-PS was synthesized as described
in our previous paper.31

Preparation
of Polymersomes
The procedure as described
in our previous literature report was used.22 A typical procedure is as follows: PEG45-b-PS230 (10 mg) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran
(THF) and 1,4-dioxane (dioxane) (1 mL, 4:1 by volume) in a 15 mL capped
vial with a magnetic stirrer. After the compounds were dissolved for
1 h at room temperature, a syringe pump equipped with a syringe with
a needle was calibrated to deliver water at a speed of 1 mL/h. The
needle from the syringe was inserted into the vial of which the cap
was replaced with a rubber septum. An amount of 0.3 mL of water was
pumped into the organic solution with vigorous stirring (900 rpm).
After the water addition was finished, 50 μL of the suspension
was dropped at once into 1 mL of pure water with stirring, which ensured
a rapid quenching of the PS domain within the bilayer of the polymersomes.

PEG Addition Methodology
A polymersome solution (200
μL, 0.8 g/L) in a mixture of THF/dioxane water = 10:3 (or 10:5,
10:10, 10:20, 10:30 and 10:40) by volume was loaded in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf
centrifugation tube. An amount of 10 μL (or another amount)
of a PEG2000 aqueous solution (1, 10, 100 g/L) was added to the polymersome
suspension (200 μL) with a frequency of 1200. After 1 min, 20
μL of the polymersome suspension was taken out to be quenched
by 1 mL of ultrapure water.

Equilibrium
The polymersome suspension
was left in
the shaker while the temperature was kept constant (20 °C). At
the desired time, 20 μL of the polymersome suspension was quenched
into 1 mL of water located in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. The tube was
centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min to remove the added PEG.
The polymersomes aggregated at the bottom of the tube were redispersed
by addition of 1 mL of water, then one drop of the suspension was
taken to prepare the TEM sample.
