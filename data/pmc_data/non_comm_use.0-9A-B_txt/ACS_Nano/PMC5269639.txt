Heterogeneity of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation
in genetically identical cells, which occurs in response to epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, remains poorly understood.
MAPK cascades integrate signals emanating from different EGFR spatial
locations, including the plasma membrane and endocytic compartment.
We previously hypothesized that in EGF-stimulated cells the MAPK phosphorylation
(pMAPK) level and activity are largely determined by the spatial organization
of the EGFR clusters within the cell. For experimental testing of
this hypothesis, we used super-resolution microscopy to define EGFR
clusters by receptor numbers (N) and average intracluster
distances (d). From these data, we predicted the
extent of pMAPK with 85% accuracy on a cell-to-cell basis with control
data returning 54% accuracy (P < 0.001). For comparison,
the prediction accuracy was only 61% (P = 0.382)
when the diffraction-limited averaged fluorescence intensity/cluster
was used. Large clusters (N ≥ 3) with d > 50 nm were most predictive for pMAPK level in cells.
Electron microscopy revealed that these large clusters were primarily
localized to the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies (MVB).
Many tighter packed dimers/multimers (d < 50 nm)
were found on intraluminal vesicles within MVBs, where they were unlikely
to activate MAPK because of the physical separation. Our results suggest
that cell-to-cell differences in N and d contain crucial information to predict EGFR-activated cellular pMAPK
levels and explain pMAPK heterogeneity in isogenic cells.

==== Body
In recent
years it has become
evident that an inhomogeneous microenvironment, combined with the
plasticity of the cancer genome, may lead to a significant degree
of functional heterogeneity among cancer cells of the same tumor.1 The magnitude and timing of the output signal
commonly varies across a population of genetically identical cells.2 The output signal integrates various receptor
inputs in space and time and directs important physiological processes
such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival among cells in
culture.3 Understanding the possible ranges
of cellular output heterogeneity and what contributes to them mechanistically
would represent a major leap forward in cell biology.

A particularly
important example is the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is a signaling hub for multiple cues
and spatiotemporally organized intracellular signal transmitters.4 Activation of MAPK signaling governs gene expression,
thereby controlling many physiological processes.5 Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
has been reported for a number of different tumor types.6 This has been postulated to lead to MAPK activation
by allowing the receptors on the cell membrane to randomly collide
and interact with one another with high frequency.7 Nanoscale imaging of the plasma membrane using near-field
scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) has recently shown that EGFR monomers
are preferentially organized in ∼150 nm clusters (i.e., not randomly distributed) in both untreated
and ligand-stimulated cells.8 Several other
studies applied scanning force microscopy to quantify EGFR clusters
but have been restricted to monitoring their spatial organization
only on the plasma membrane.9,10 We previously hypothesized
that the MAPK signaling activity is largely determined by the spatial
organization of the EGFR clusters (at a nanometer proximity scale),
which, together with the associated Shc/Grb2/SOS/RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK
complexes (that usually involve assembling scaffold proteins), will
mainly determine the MAPK signaling output in individual cells.11 Experimental validation of this hypothesis has
not been achieved to date.

Nowadays super-resolution fluorescence
imaging methods can achieve
spatial resolutions in the tens of nanometers.12−16 This enables the measurement of nanometer intracluster
distances and the number of receptor molecules per cluster throughout
a mammalian cell, which typically spreads in the tens of micrometer
range,17−19 identifying individual receptors and their clusters
located on various structural components. A prior study combined super-resolution
microscopy and single-molecule FRET to investigate the dynamics and
localization of activated EGFR dimers on the plasma membrane of live
cells.20 A different report applied STORM
to provide mechanistic insights into EGFR cluster formation.21 However, none of these studies have looked at
endocytosed EGFRs trafficking to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) located
in the perinuclear region of a cell.22,23 EGFR clusters
continue to signal from the endosomal and MVB membranes, activating
MAPK via mechanisms that involve scaffold proteins
such as MP1.24−26 Little is known about the relationship between the
cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the spatial organization of these EGFR
clusters and the functional consequences in the cellular response
on a single-cell level.

Here, we used generalized single-molecule
high-resolution imaging
with photobleaching (gSHRImP)12,15 to characterize the
intracellular heterogeneity in MAPK phosphorylation levels in response
to EGF stimulation on a cell-by-cell basis. Quantum dot (QD) blinking
has been successfully used as an alternative to photoswitching of
organic fluorophores or photoactivatable proteins.27 We quantified two EGFR cluster parameters, i.e., EGFR molecule number per cluster (N) and average intracluster distance (d) between
any two individual EGFR molecules, and used them as input parameters
for a Bayesian model to predict MAPK signaling output on a cellular
basis. We also employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to
determine the spatial location of EGFR clusters in the cells relative
to their organelle structures. We were able to predict on a cell-by-cell
level MAPK phosphorylation states on the basis of nanoscale organizational
differences in EGFR clusters that are super-resolved. This lends support
to and extends our previous proposition that the endosomal and MVB
membrane localization of EGFR clusters can cause an increase in the
number (or average lifetime) of signaling complexes, in a manner that
is dependent on the spatial organization within the receptor oligomeric
configuration.11

Results and Discussion
Cell-to-Cell
Heterogeneity in Growth Factor-Stimulated MAPK
Phosphorylation
MAPK (ERK1/ERK2) phosphorylation is a well-studied
readout of MAPK pathway activation downstream of EGFR activation.
We stimulated the monoclonal breast cancer cell line HCC1143 with
EGF for various lengths of time at both 4 and 37 °C and analyzed
MAPK phosphorylation on a population level by immunoblotting (see Supporting Information A, Figure S1) and on a
cell-by-cell level by immunofluorescence (Figure 1). The antibodies we used were specific for
the residues pT202/pY204 (ERK1) and pT185/pY187 (ERK2), respectively.
Treatment at 4 °C was used to engage receptors with EGF but slow
signaling response and receptor endocytosis.28 On a population basis, MAPK phosphorylation peaked after 15 min
of EGF treatment at 37 °C (Figure S1A,B). As expected, no MAPK phosphorylation was observed by treating
cells at 4 °C, although phosphorylation of EGFR, immediate adaptor
proteins, and some downstream targets (PI3K and PLCγ) at 15
and 30 min was previously reported.29 Cellular
heterogeneity of MAPK signaling was revealed by immunofluorescence
microscopy after 15 or 30 min treatment at 37 °C, as is demonstrated
by the broadening of the anti-pMAPK intensity distributions (Figure 1). Full width half-maximum
(fwhm) was 138 arbitrary units (a.u.) when cells were treated at 4
°C for 30 min. The fwhm increased to 524 au after 15 min at 37
°C and narrowed upon longer treatment (30 min at 37 °C)
to 336 au; hence fwhm ratios (as a measure of histogram broadening)
as compared to control conditions were 3.8 and 2.4, respectively.
This shows an increase in range of observed pMAPK output values and
reflects heterogenic behavior between these otherwise isogenic cells
as compared to control conditions (4 °C). It is noteworthy that
averaging of immunofluorescence intensities over many cells led to
a result resembling immunoblotting (Figure S1C), as both techniques are averaging over the whole population.

Figure 1 Cell-to-cell
heterogeneity of HCC1143 breast cancer cells in their
MAPK signaling response subsequent to EGF stimulation. Each histogram
was built from single-cell phospho-MAPK intensity levels (arbitrary
units (a.u.)) from three independent experiments (9 confocal tiles
per image, N ≥ 350 cells per condition for
each experiment). The full width half-maximum (fwhm) of the anti-phospho-MAPK
intensity is a measure of cellular heterogeneity. Typical micrographs
are shown.

Several studies reported on the
existence of higher order ErbB
multimers and their functional relevance to signaling.30−32 EGFR cluster formation has been reported to require EGFR kinase
activity.30,33 Members of the ErbB family have been shown
to assemble into higher order nanostructures, but a precise structure–function
relationship of these assemblies, in terms of how they specify signal
output, remains unclear.34,35 High-resolution imaging
methods are required to investigate the significance of receptor nanoscale
organization in regulating its function. Ranges of cluster diameters
were measured with NSOM and found to have an average diameter of 150
± 80 nm EGF-stimulated HeLa cells.8 This study validated and complemented a prior report that estimated
an average EGFR cluster density of 33/μm2 with 10–30
EGFR receptors per cluster in the same cell line.36

Quantitative Analysis of EGFR Nanoclusters
by Super-resolution
Imaging
We employed super-resolution microscopy to visualize
individual EGFR receptors and their oligomerization patterns on the
spatial scales below the diffraction limit following EGF stimulation.8 To fluorescently label EGFR, we followed a previously
reported approach37 to generate equimolar
complexes of biotinylated EGF with streptavidin-QD565 (EBSQ) under
carefully chosen reaction conditions (see Methods). The EBSQ complex was verified to be equivalent with EGF in stimulating
pMAPK signaling responses and EGFR internalization (see Supporting Information B, Figure S2). The proximity
between single EGFR molecules on the nanometer scale has been recognized
as a prerequisite for receptor activation, and crystallographic studies
have shown an asymmetric, ligand-induced activated EGFR dimer.38,39 Nanopositioning of EBSQ molecules bound to EGFRs was based on the
intrinsic capability of QDs to blink and was determined using generalized
SHRImP12,40 as described in Methods. Blinking was assigned to individual QDs based on the observed stepwise
intensity changes before and after blinking events (Figure 2A/D). Figure 2 shows examples of an EGFR dimer (Figure 2B/C) and an EGFR
trimer (Figure 2E/F)
including the corresponding intensity vs time curves
(Figure 2A/D). The
large purple spot represents the diffraction-limited image of excited
EGFRs bound to EBSQ molecules, while the super-resolved individual
EBSQ-bound EGFR positions are shown in white.

Figure 2 Super-resolution microscopy
of EGFR clusters. EBSQ bound to EGFR
was imaged and super-resolved by gSHRImP based on QD blinking. A receptor
dimer (A–C) or trimer (D–F) appears as a blurry spot
expanding about 4–5 actual camera pixels (100 nm/pixel) in
diameter when imaged by diffraction-limited microscopy (purple). For
visual guidance, we show the mean fluorescence intensity levels corresponding
to the individual QDs by red dotted lines in QD blinking traces (A
or D). Both traces have the background subtracted. The white overlay
images in (B) and (E) represent the corresponding Gaussian point-spread-functions
(PSFs) as determined via the gSHRImP algorithm. Please
note that gSHRImP PSFs are not intensity-normalized. The final super-resolved
images are generated by determining the centers of the single-molecule
PSFs and are shown in zoomed-in micrographs in (C) for the dimer (EGFR
molecules are 24 nm apart) and (F) for the trimer (EGFR distances
are 92, 107, and 116 nm, respectively). Yellow circles indicate individual
EGFR molecule positions with the circle centers positioned at the
calculated centroid positions of each EGFR molecule. Scale bars are
50 nm.

Our super-resolution technique
(see Methods and Supporting Information C) allowed
us to resolve QDs with up to 15 nm lateral resolution.12 Here, the resolution is taken to be the smallest
distance at which two EGFR molecules could be separated. We estimated
the EBSQ complexes to be <20 nm (see Supporting Information D). A cluster is defined as the group of super-resolved
receptors within a diffraction-limited spot. Intracluster distances
(dij) were measured as
distances between individual QDs using centroid coordinates of each
localized QD. In order to correlate MAPK activation with EGFR cluster
formation under different experimental conditions, we measured, first,
MAPK phosphorylation of a cell using wide-field immunofluorescence
microscopy as a surrogate for its MAPK pathway activation and, second,
EGFR cluster organization by EBSQ super-resolution imaging. From the
super-resolution images we then determined the number of EGFR molecules
per cluster (N) and the average intracluster distance
between EGFR monomers (d). When super-resolved, the
vast majority of the diffraction-limited EBSQ spots imaged in HCC1143
cells incubated at 4 °C were EGFR monomers (>70%), with 20%
EGFR
dimers and the remainder being trimers and, rarely, multimers (Figure 3A). Upon EBSQ treatment
at 37 °C, this balance shifted dramatically at the expense of
EGFR monomers. Longer EBSQ stimulation at 37 °C (30 min) led
to a reduction of the number of dimers and trimers, but an increase
in multimer numbers as compared to shorter treatment (15 min). These
data are in line with previous reports of EGFR cluster formation upon
EGF treatment.33,41 Some of the larger, multimeric
clusters could not be spatially resolved and, hence, could not be
included in the prediction of pMAPK based on d or N and d combined. A number of clusters
with N up to 4–6 were well resolved and included
in the analysis (Figure 3B). For simplicity, from here onward, we will refer to this particular
cluster group as “N > 3”.

Figure 3 Cell-by-cell
analysis of EGFR clusters. (A) Number of resolved
EGFR clusters under different treatment conditions. Clusters were
categorized into EGFR monomers, dimers, trimers, and oligomers as
determined by counting the number of receptors per resolved cluster.
Oligomers formed of more than 5 or 6 receptors could not always be
resolved. (B) Trimers and fully resolvable multimers (i.e., clusters with N = 4–6;
from here onward referred to as “N > 3”
multimers) were analyzed for their intracluster distances between
EGFR molecules. We categorized them as either d ≤
50 nm or d > 50 nm. The relative numbers in those
cluster categories change upon treatment. (C) Binary classification
of each HCC1143 cell in each treatment condition into a “low”
and “high” pMAPK intensity class. Data shown in all
panels were obtained from 46 analyzed cells and 2164 clusters acquired
in two independent experiments. The classes are significantly different; P < 0.0001 (unpaired two-tailed t-test
with Welch’s correction assuming unequal standard deviation).

Using the Number of EGFR
Receptors per Cluster (N) to Predict Cellular MAPK
Phosphorylation
Super-resolution
microscopy allowed us to determine two important parameters characterizing
EGFR nanoclusters, N and d, which
were used for a data-driven prediction of the MAPK phosphorylation
level as an indicator of EGFR signaling. To test whether N or d, or both, contain any predictive information
regarding the pMAPK intensity levels, we used a mathematical model
based on a Bayesian linear classifier (BLC).42,43 The BLC is an algorithm that attempts to find a linear combination
of input covariates that can be used to predict which class each cell
belongs to; classes were either “high/activated” or
“low/resting” MAPK phosphorylation. The pMAPK level
was quantified by wide-field immunofluorescence microscopy on a cell-by-cell
basis by measuring the average fluorescence intensity per unit area.
Activated and resting cells separated in two groups that were significantly
different (Figure 3C; P < 0.0001), i.e., “high/activated” or “low/resting”.
The algorithm was first trained to make a classification decision.
The cells were randomly separated into a training set and a validation
set. Initially, the BLC was used to predict pMAPK using N as the only input variable. The four covariates used were the fraction
of monomers (N = 1), dimers (N =
2), trimers (N = 3), and oligomers (N > 3) as determined by super-resolution microscopy for each individual
cell. Figure 4A shows
the training and validation success rates as a function of the number
of covariates used in the BLC with the corresponding weights shown
in Figure 4B. The trained
BLC predicted “high” or “low” MAPK phosphorylation
classes using these input variables with an accuracy of 65% (P = 0.090) in the validation set. To compare, a randomized
data set of no predictive value yielded a prediction accuracy of 54%.
Dimers and trimers were most predictive for EGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation,
shown by the positive weights (see Methods).

Figure 4 BLC-based prediction of cellular MAPK phosphorylation. Prediction
uses the number of EGFR molecules per cluster N as
the only input parameter (A and B) or both N and
the intracluster distances d as input parameters
(C and D). (A, C) BLC prediction performance of the training and validation
sets as a function of the number of covariates used. (B, D) Graphical
representation of the regression weights assigned to each covariate.
The magnitude of each weight gives a measure of how informative each
covariate is in predicting the class membership. A positive weight
implies that large values of that covariate are associated with the
“high” class, whereas a negative weight indicates that
large values of that covariate are associated with the “low”
class. The weights are obtained by averaging over the weights obtained
during leave-one-out cross-validation with all covariates. The 95%
confidence intervals of the regression weights are plotted. The Bayesian
analysis has been performed on imaging data acquired in two independent
experiments.

Prediction of Cellular
MAPK Phosphorylation Is Improved by Inclusion
of EGFR Nanoscale Proximity Information
First, we tested
if intracluster distances d alone contain any information
predictive for pMAPK. Applying BLC as before, we found d alone is not predictive for pMAPK (46%; P = 0.733; Supporting Information E, Figure S4). We then
combined both parameters of the EGFR cluster, N and d, to test if this would improve prediction accuracy as
compared to N alone. We divided the data into six
subsets based on the various combinations between the number of receptors
per cluster (N = 2, 3, or >3) and average intracluster
distance (d ≤ 50 nm or d >
50 nm). Applying BLC with this new set of covariates, we achieved
a prediction accuracy of 85% (P < 0.001, Figure 4C), which was much
higher than what could be achieved with either of the two parameters
individually. Combination of N = 4 and N = 3 into one covariate caused a drop in accuracy from 85% to 78%
(the weight of the redefined covariate remains positive and statistically
significant). Thus, we upheld the previous division of subsets. The
probability of obtaining a “high” MAPK phosphorylation
classification in an individual cell was observed to increase with
increasing N until N became greater
than 3 (Figure 4A).
The ranking of the covariate weights of the intracluster distance
(d) within the N = 3 and N > 3 clusters revealed that d >
50 nm
was positively correlated with a greater extent of MAPK phosphorylation
(Figure 4D; N = 3: P = 0.0465, significant; N > 3: P = 0.0601, trend); that is,
trimers
and, to a lesser extent, multimers with an average intracluster distance d > 50 nm were the top predictive classes. In contrast,
clusters with d ≤ 50 nm were not predictive
for MAPK phosphorylation. The quantitative analysis presented in Figure 4 was performed on
pooled data obtained from two independent biological experiments for
better statistics (individual experimental cohorts and their individual
analyses are shown in Supporting Information F). The two replicates displayed a similar distribution of clusters
across the covariate bins used (Figure S5A) and achieved prediction accuracies of 89% (Figure S5B) and 82% (Figure S5C), respectively.

It is noteworthy that the same BLC-based prediction
of pMAPK could also be performed using diffraction-limited fluorescence
microscopy data. When we calculated the best achievable predictive
accuracy by using averaged fluorescence intensities of EGFR clusters
per cell as the only input, this resulted in a poor prediction accuracy
of only 61% (P = 0.382), which was marginally above
the randomized data set with no predictive value (54%).

Considering
that nanoscale proximity between EGFR molecules is
a prerequisite for EGFR downstream signaling,38,39 our data appeared to be counterintuitive. To find a possible explanation
why trimers and multimers with average intracluster distances d > 50 nm are more predictive than dimers, trimers, and
multimers with average intracluster distances d ≤
50 nm, we investigated the intracellular trafficking behavior of the
EGFR subpopulations of interest by direct visualization of their subcellular
localization via TEM.

Top Predictive EGFR Subpopulations
Localize Predominantly on
the Limiting Membrane of MVBs
To understand the relationship
between the number of EGFRs per cluster N, the average
intracluster distance d, and the BLC weighting of
the super-resolution microscopy data, we quantified the spatial distribution
of clusters of N = 2, N = 3, and N > 3 EGFR receptors and correlated it to their location
within endosomes as determined by TEM. TEM allowed us to acquire images
of subcellular structures and visualize the partitioning of individual
and clustered EGFRs between the limiting membranes of MVBs (Figure S6) and intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within
the MVB lumen (Figure 5A). The super-resolution approach analyzes all EGFR regardless of
position in the cell, while the requirement for ultrahigh magnification
to visualize gold by TEM prevents parallel whole-cell analysis. We
therefore only analyzed endocytosed EGFR gold particles (present on
small endocytic vesicles and MVBs with one or more ILVs), which also
minimized the possibility of analyzing EGFR that had not bound ligand.
EGFR clusters were defined by all gold-labeled antibody-conjugated
receptors with separation distances less than 22 nm between adjacent
nanogold particles. The cutoff was empirically determined to sensibly
assign particles to a cluster as visualized in the TEM images. After
30 min at 37 °C the majority of N ≥ 3
multimers with larger intracluster distances displayed a tendency
to localize on the limiting membrane of MVBs (Figure S6), while many of the more compact clusters were sequestered
on ILVs within the MVB lumen (Figure 5B). The mean of the average size clusters with N ≥ 3 located on the limiting membrane was significantly
larger than that of clusters located on ILVs (P =
0.0247, unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s
correction). This is a good fit with our model, showing that EGFR
trimer and multimer subpopulations with large intracluster distances
(N > 3, d > 50 nm) are top
predictors
of MAPK phosphorylation.

and subcellular
localization of EGF-induced EGFR cluster formation in HCC1143 cells.
Black arrows point toward the limiting membrane of the MVB, while
white arrows point toward ILVs; scale bar is 100 nm. (B) Partitioning
between MVB limiting membranes or ILV membranes for dimers, trimers,
and multimers across all measured average intracluster distances;
a box and whisker plot is shown with whiskers indicating minimum/maximum
values. Localization on the limiting membrane of MVB becomes dominant
with increasing average intracluster distance and number of receptors
per cluster. Localization on the limiting membrane was found significantly
different than localization on ILVs for trimers (P = 0.0247) using an unpaired two-tailed t-test with
Welch’s correction assuming unequal standard deviation.

We found the most predictive EGFR
subpopulation to be N ≥ 3 clusters with average
sizes larger than 50 nm (P = 0.0465). This first
appeared counterintuitive considering
EGFR signaling is initiated upon ligand binding to the receptor followed
by its dimerization/multimerization. Importantly, TEM experiments
allowed us to reveal the subcellular organization of the various subpopulations.
While TEM does not have the quantitative statistical power of the
super-resolution approach, it reveals the suborganellar EGFR distribution.
TEM suggests a possible explanation for the predictive power of larger
clusters (N ≥ 3, d > 50
nm)
compared with smaller clusters. The predictive large clusters were
mainly located on the limiting membrane of endocytic vesicles and
multivesicular bodies, where they play an active role in signal transduction.
In contrast, many dimers and densely packed EGFR multimers (N ≥ 3, d ≤ 50 nm) were located
on ILVs and, thus, no longer contributed to the overall EGFR signaling
response because of their physical separation from the vast majority
of the MAPK pool, which resides in the cytosol.

The significance
of the EGFR ≥ 3 multimers on the limiting
membrane in triggering the MAPK signaling output may be explained
by virtue of the associated Shc/Grb2/SOS/RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK complexes
as we previously postulated through models.11 Some corroborative evidence for this has previously been obtained
using image correlation spectroscopy and Foerster resonance energy
transfer imaging. This approach showed in EGF-stimulated BaF/3 cells
that were stably transfected with Grb2 (Grb2-mRFP) and EGFR (EGFR-eGFP)
nanometer-scale association of Grb2-mRFP with EGFR-eGFP multimers,
which contained, on average, 4 ± 1 copies of EGFR-eGFP.44 Many differences exist between this observation
and our current work. These include differences in cell types, overexpressed45vs endogenous receptors (our
study). Importantly, both report on a similar stoichiometry of the
EGFR multimers that signal most efficiently in cells.

The spatial
organization of cell surface receptors on variable
length scales (from molecules to micrometers) plays an important role
in cell signaling.45 These cell-to-cell
differences can provide a mechanism to control protein interactions
and thus modulate signal transduction efficiency. Here, we were able
to relate the spatial organization of the EGFR receptors to signaling
dynamics and show that large EGFR trimers are the most predictive
subpopulation for MAPK phosphorylation output. Our results strengthen
the hypothesis that supramolecular receptor organization and spatial
compartmentalization play a decisive role in signal transduction,
thereby influencing cell fate and function. Our findings further reveal
EGFR trimers and their intracluster distances to play a role as a
marker of MAPK phosphorylation. Pending further validation in more
complex samples such as cell mixtures and tissues, this finding has
potential applications beyond mechanistic signal transduction studies.
A better understanding of the role of differentially located EGFR
multimers (limiting membrane vs ILV), e.g., by further dissecting the N and d information on our reported ILV-located EGFR
in the context of chemotherapy resistance,46 may have potential value in future clinical applications.

Conclusion
To better understand how signals are integrated and transmitted
through signaling networks, we provide a framework for using super-resolution
microscopy to access detailed spatial information about specific cellular
molecules, and how to use it, in combination with mathematical modeling,
to predict cellular outcomes. As a paradigm, we focused on how the
spatial organization of the EGFR oligomeric network specifies the
output signal through to MAPK phosphorylation in genetically identical
cells. Ensemble behaviors of a population of cells may not reveal
silent features of cell signaling. On the other hand, cell-to-cell
differences are always present in any cell population and may or may
not serve a biological function or contain meaningful information.
Super-resolution imaging has been previously combined with TEM,13 but we report here an integrated cell-by-cell
approach between the two imaging techniques to extract detailed spatial
information on EGFR distribution. Assembly of EGFRs into homodimers
and small-size multimers occurs on spatial scales in between those
probed by FRET (<10 nm) and diffraction-limited microscopy (>200
nm). Our method, with a resolution of 15 nm, is an excellent approach
for studying receptor multimerization at this spatial scale.

Our approach was to analyze and interpret heterogeneity in cellular
pMAPK levels by looking at the individual cell behavior and correlating
it to the detailed spatial organization of super-resolved EGFR clusters.
Our finding is that the number of EGFR molecules per cluster N and the average EGFR intracluster distance d are highly informative for the prediction of the EGF-driven pMAPK
output. N alone, d alone, and N and d combined were alternatively used as input parameters
for a BLC to model, train, and validate the technique, resulting in
prediction accuracies for MAPK phosphorylation of 65% (P = 0.090), 46% (P = 0.733), and 85% (P < 0.001), respectively. A randomized data set of no predictive
value yielded an accuracy of 54%, demonstrating a 31% gain in accuracy
if the N and d information is combined. The intracluster
distance information is crucial in this prediction, as it improves
accuracy from 65% (P = 0.090; with only EGFR numbers
regarded) to 85% (P < 0.001). We and others have
previously applied super-resolution imaging to visualize EGFR clusters.20,21,27 Here we report using super-resolved
cluster parameters to accurately predict the individual cells’
MAPK phosphorylation levels. This approach of combining advanced imaging
with mathematical modeling to understand systems level integration
can be extended to improve our understanding of how many similar receptor
tyrosine kinases function in various types of cancer.

Cell Treatments and Sample Preparation for
Super-resolution
Microscopy
Triple-negative HCC1143 (ATCC) cells/cm2 (30 000) were seeded in complete 10% FBS-containing growth
medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 25 mM l-glutamine, and 100 IU penicillin/streptomycin) onto sterile acid-treated
glass coverslips (20 mm diameter, glass thickness no. 1.5; Metzler).
On the day of the experiment, cells were washed twice with serum-free
growth medium and then treated with 10 nM preformed EGF-biotin:streptavidin-QD565
(EBSQ) complexes in serum-free growth medium at either 4 or 37 °C
for the indicated times. EBSQ complexes were formed by mixing equimolar
amounts of prewashed streptavidin-QD565 with biotinylated EGF (both
from Life Technologies). A dilute solution of biotinylated EGF (200
nM) was slowly pipetted using a Hamilton syringe (over minutes) into
a more concentrated solution of streptavidin-QD565 (1 μM) while
continuously stirring. The mixture was allowed to react for 30 min
on ice. The equimolar reaction was carried out at a biotin:streptavidin
ratio of 1:16–20. Reaction mixtures were purified from potential
free EGF using P30 size exclusion spin columns (Biorad). After treatment,
cells were washed three times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS;
25 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH = 7.4) and fixed for 15 min in 4%
(w/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (PFA) dissolved in TBS. Subsequently,
cells were permeabilized with 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS, washed
twice with TBS, and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)
in TBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with
the indicated primary antibodies (in blocking solution, at 4 °C
for 16 h), washed three times with TBS, and then stained with the
indicated secondary antibodies in blocking solution at room temperature
for 45 min. After two washing steps each with TBS and distilled water,
samples were mounted in Mowiol (Polysciences) and left to air-dry
in the dark at room temperature overnight. To correct for stage drift,
polystyrene beads (0.1% (w/v), average diameter 1.23 μm, Spherotech)
were added to the mounting medium as fiduciary markers.

Confocal Fluorescence
Microscopy
Confocal images were
obtained using an upright Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope,
equipped with a blue 405 diode laser, an argon ion laser, and a green
HeNe 543 nm laser using the recommended filter sets for imaging of
Hoechst 33342, FITC/GFP, and TRITC/RFP. Images were taken with a Plan-Apochromat
oil objective 63×, NA = 1.4 (Zeiss). Image processing was performed
using the Fiji/ImageJ software.

gSHRImp Super-resolution
Imaging with QD Blinking
Super-resolution
images were acquired using gSHRImP mostly as previously reported.12,15 Here, specifically, intrinsic blinking of quantum dots instead of
photobleaching of organic dyes was employed to achieve super-resolution.
We used backward subtraction of the image frames to find single blinking
events of individual QDs and stochastically resolve their localizations
with nanometer accuracy. Drift correction (Figure S3) was performed using bright-field scattering images of the
nonfluorescent beads acquired on a distinct CCD camera (CV-A55 IR
E, JAI Ltd.) synchronized to the fluorescence imaging CCD (iXon+,
Andor) for the entire duration of the measurement. Images were acquired
at a rate of 33 frames/s. Typically, we imaged areas with a minimum
of three fluorescent beads in the field of view and plotted the calibration
drift curve by averaging the beads’ displacement in the x and y direction, respectively. Trajectories
were extracted by tracking the beads’ position at each frame
using in-house written code running on the IDL platform version 8.4
(Exelis). All images were corrected for drift individually, and super-resolution
images were plotted using in-house-written software as previously
reported.15

Sample Preparation for
Transmission Electron Microscopy
HCC1143 cells/cm2 (300 000) were seeded on six-well
Epon plates (Agar Scientific) in serum-containing growth medium. On
the next day, cells were washed twice with serum-free growth medium
before they were incubated with the anti-EGFR antibody directed against
the extracellular EGFR domain (clone 108) that was conjugated to colloidal
10 nm gold particles as previously described.47 Optimum gold loading into the cells was observed for 30 min of incubation
with 80 nM EGF (Peprotech) present alongside the gold-conjugated EGFR
antibody. Subsequently, cells were fixed by applying a mixture of
2% (w/v) PFA and 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer
for 30 min. After washing twice with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, cells
were treated with 1% tannic acid in cacodylate buffer and prepared
for TEM as previously reported.48 Sections
of 70 nm thickness were cut using a Leica EM UC microtome and imaged
on a JEOL JEM 1010 electron microscope.

Cluster Analysis of TEM
Data
EGFR cluster analysis
was done using Fiji/ImageJ software with the Graph plugin.49 Gold particles were manually selected and the
distance matrix between all the particles was calculated. Adjacent
particles separated by less than 50 nm between their centroids were
classified as connected components and assigned to the same cluster.
The number of particles per cluster (NEM) and the average intracluster distance (dEM) were determined for a total of 10 cells and 702 clusters. The average
intracluster distance was calculated as the average of all distances
between all particles within the cluster.

Bayesian Linear Classifier
Analysis
A Bayesian linear
classifier43 was used to predict MAPK activation
status on a cell-by-cell basis. Cells were assigned to a “high”
or “low” binary class depending on MAPK phosphorylation
(fluorescence intensity averaged over the entire cell). The fluorescence
intensity was calculated from a single frame, right after the exposure
to the excitation light and before any photobleaching could occur.
The threshold for separating the two classes represented the halfway
value between the medians of the EGF treated and untreated cell populations
and was determined to be 2396 a.u. A cell belonged to the “high”
class if its average fluorescence intensity per pixel was higher,
and to the “low” class if lower, than the threshold
value. MAPK phosphorylation prediction was based on the various covariates
derived from super-resolution imaging of EGFR clusters, i.e., proportions of clusters in each of the N-mer or N–d subclasses. The BLC
seeks an optimal linear relationship between the input parameters
and the binary classes. The intracohort reproducibility of the BLC
classification was estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation.
One sample is set aside for validation, and the remaining samples
are used for training the BLC. The cells were randomly separated into
a training set and a validation set (see Methods); the training set was used to train the BLC, which subsequently
was used for predictions using the validation set. The BLC was first
used with a complete set of input variables; then the least informative
covariate was removed (the one with the smallest weighting) and a
new BLC was trained and used for prediction. Once trained, the model
was used to predict which class the omitted sample belonged to. This
was repeated until each sample in the cohort had been used for validation.
The training success was defined as the (mean) fraction of cells correctly
classified after training, and the validation success was the fraction
of validation set cells that were correctly predicted. The BLC assigned
weights to each of the input parameters. These indicate the relative
strength of each parameter as a reporter of EGFR signaling to MAPK.
The weights are determined by computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution of the BLC. To obtain 95% credible intervals (CIs),
we approximated the posterior density with a multivariate Gaussian
density by evaluating the curvature matrix at the MAP solution. By
making predictions on a validation data set we tested the reproducibility
of the inferred weights. The high validation performance indicates
that the inferred weights are genuine (as opposed to statistical flukes).
Beginning with all of the covariates, the covariate with the smallest
absolute value weight (averaged over training and validation runs)
was eliminated, and the entire procedure was repeated until only a
single covariate remained. Under the null hypothesis that there is
no association between the covariates and high/low intensity status
we estimated a P value using a permutation test.
The covariates were randomly permuted 1000 times, and the maximum
prediction accuracy was recorded each time. A P value
was obtained based on the comparison of the observed predictive accuracy
with a randomized data set of no predictive value (that yielded a
prediction accuracy of 54%).
