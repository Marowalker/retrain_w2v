A common event in optic neuropathies
is the loss of axons and death
of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) resulting in irreversible blindness.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway agonists have
been shown to foster axon regeneration and RGC survival in animal
models of optic nerve damage. However, many challenges remain in developing
therapies that exploit cell growth and tissue remodeling including
(i) activating/inhibiting cell pathways synergistically, (ii) avoiding
tumorigenesis, and (iii) ensuring appropriate physiological tissue
function. These challenges are further exacerbated by the need to
overcome ocular physiological barriers and clearance mechanisms. Here
we present liposomes loaded with multiple mTOR pathway stimulating
biologics designed to enhance neuroprotection after retina damage.
Liposomes were loaded with ciliary neurotrophic factor, insulin-like
growth factor 1, a lipopeptide N-fragment osteopontin mimic, and lipopeptide
phosphatase tension homologue inhibitors for either the ATP domain
or the c-terminal tail. In a mouse model of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid induced RGC death, a single intravitreal administration
of liposomes reduced both RGC death and loss of retina electrophysiological
function. Furthermore, combining liposomes with transplantation of
induced pluripotent stem cell derived RGCs led to an improved electrophysiological
outcome in mice. The results presented here show that liposomes carrying
multiple signaling pathway modulators can facilitate neuroprotection
and transplant electrophysiological outcome.

==== Body
Optic neuropathies (e.g., glaucoma, etc.) are a leading cause
of irreversible blindness worldwide, impairing patient quality of
life and posing a negative impact on socioeconomics.1 A common event in optic neuropathies is the loss of RGC
axons in both the optic nerve (ON) and retina, followed by the death
of RGCs.2,3 RGCs are responsible for signal transmission
from the retina to the brain and RGC death through apoptosis4 is associated with progressive loss of vision.
Lack of regenerative capacity in the mammalian retina makes the loss
of RGCs irreversible. Autologous nerve grafts for ON damage are undesirable
due to excessive surgery (or unfeasible depending on location of damage)
while retina transplantation for retina damage has had poor success.5 Multiple factors contribute to neuronal loss
in the retina including failure of axonal transport; toxic pro-neurotrophins;
intrinsic and extrinsic activation of apoptotic signals; mitochondrial
dysfunction; excitotoxic damage; oxidative stress; misbehaving reactive
glia; loss of synaptic connectivity and neurotrophic factor (NF) deprivation.6 The multifactorial nature of optic neuropathies
would indicate that a combination therapy (e.g.,
combined pharmacotherapies, pharmacotherapy, and cell therapy, etc.) linked to neuroprotection and/or nerve regeneration
would significantly improve the outcome of optic neuropathies. This
is indicated by previous studies either involving the supplementation
of different neurotrophic factors to protect RGCs in different animal
models (induced hypertension, ON transection and ON crush7−13) or the deletion of cell growth regulatory genes PTEN and SOCS3
to protect RGCs after axotomy.14−16

Arguably, the most striking
results in axon regrowth after ON transection
so far have been achieved by Bei et al. using a combination
of adeno-associated virus (AAV) assisted overexpression of ciliary
neurotrophic factor (CNTF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and
osteopontin (OPN), combined with AAV codeletion of PTEN and SOCS3
genes.17 CNTF and IGF-1 have both been
shown to promote axon regeneration by activation of the mTOR pathway.4,17−20 The cytokine CNTF is capable of activating several different signaling
pathways such as JAK-signal transducers, MAPK, PI3K, and mTOR-p70S6K
by binding to receptors at the cell surface.21 CNTF has been shown to stimulate mTOR activation of STAT3, hence
implicating CNTF and mTOR as transcriptional regulators in neuroblastoma
cells.22 CNTF supplementation has also
been shown to prevent the decrease in mTOR activity in vitro in RGCs.23 IGF-1 is a protein hormone
that binds to a receptor tyrosine kinases (IGF-1R) on the cell surface24 activating PI3K.25,26 IGF-1 and
regulation of the MDM4/2-p53-IGF-1 pathway has been shown to be critical
for axonal sprouting and neurological recovery after spinal cord injury.27 OPN is a secreted phosphoprotein that binds
to receptors recognizing the Arg–Gly–Asp protein motif.28 OPN is implicated in maintenance and reconfiguration
of tissue integrity during inflammation by modulating the extracellular
matrix (ECM).29 In a stroke model in Sprague–Dawley
rat, OPN has been shown to be neuroprotective,30 and in combination with IGF-1, OPN has been shown to promote
regeneration of alpha RGCs after axotomy.31 Phosphatase tension homologue (PTEN) is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates
PIP3 to PIP2 resulting in inhibition of the
Akt/mTOR pathway. PTEN deletion by virus mediated gene silencing has
been shown to prevent RGC apoptosis after ON cut32 and enhance the regenerative potential of neurons in the
corticospinal tract.33

For clinical
translation, combining mTOR pathway stimulating biologics
for RGC neuroprotection requires modifications that would provide
better control over cell pathway modulator (i.e.,
promoters, inhibitors, inducers, agonists and antagonists) delivery,
release, clearance and residency time. Nanocarriers represent one
of many possible solutions (e.g., microcarriers,
implants, etc.) in delivering multiple cell pathway
modulators while controlling modulator release. Nanocarriers protect
sensitive cargos from degradation, can reduce the effect of clearance
mechanisms and improve absorption of cargos across physiological barriers.
Liposomes, phospholipid vesicles frequently containing cholesterol,
are an attractive delivery system for retina diseases,34 offering loading of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
molecules, prolonged retention in the eye after intraocular (intravitreal
or subretinal) injection,35−39 protection of cargo from degradation40 and have a history of clinical approval.41 The majority of liposomal research in central nervous system (CNS)
aspects is associated with overcoming the blood brain barrier to improve
the delivery of drugs to the brain.42−44 Liposomes and lipoplexes
have been shown to effectively deliver the RPE65 gene, critical for
vision, in RPE65 knockout blind mice leading to an improvement in
vision.39 Limited work has been reported
on neuroprotection and nerve regeneration. Cationic liposomes and
corresponding lipoplexes have been used to transfer neurotrophic factor
genes (e.g., glial derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor etc.) in both spinal cord and brain injury models.45,46 These studies have shown neuroprotection and partial restoration
of locomotor function.45,46 Immunomodulation, via the selective
apoptosis of monocytes and phagocytic macrophages using clodronate
loaded liposomes, has shown partial hindlimb recovery and neuron repair
in a rat spinal cord injury model.47 To
our knowledge, liposomes loaded with multiple cell pathway have not
previously been reported for CNS neuroprotection and regeneration.
Liposomes loaded with multiple cell pathway modulators have the advantage
of delivering theses modulators to the cell microenvironment at the
same time, facilitating a synergistic effect on single or multiple
cell pathways. Furthermore, signaling pathway modulators are often
highly efficacious and only very low concentrations are required.
This reduces the need for high drug loading and maximizing the space
available to pack a range of therapeutic small molecules, peptides
and proteins into the liposome.

In this study, we present two
liposome formulations that promote
neuroprotection through stimulating the mTOR pathway. Liposome aqueous
cores were loaded with CNTF and IGF-1. Liposome membranes were loaded
with lipid conjugated peptides OPP and either PAP2 or PAP4. OPP is
a peptide analogue of the N-fragment of OPN (specifically the RGD
and α9β1/α4β1 domains29) that has been shown
to mimic the function of recombinant human OPN48 and lower cytosolic Ca2+ in a way similar to
OPN.49 PAPs are PTEN antagonist peptides
with PAP2 targeting the ATP B type domain and PAP4 targeting the c-terminal
tail of PTEN.50 We show that multifarious
mTOR pathway stimulating biologic loaded liposomes significantly prevent
RGC death and loss of retina electrophysiological function in a N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) mouse model. To
further explore combination therapy, we combine one neuroprotective
liposome formulation with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived
RGC transplantation in the NMDA mouse model and show improved electrophysiological
outcome of the transplantation.

Results and Discussion
Liposomes
The palmitoyl (C16) conjugated
peptides (i.e., lipopeptides) C16-OPP,
C16-PAP2, and C16-PAP4 (referred to as OPP,
PAP2, and PAP4 from now on), were all successfully synthesized and
purified by semipreparative reverse phase HPLC to a purity of >95%
confirmed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Liposomes were produced as illustrated
in Figure 1A. Liposomes
showed low polydispersity index (PDI < 0.1) with diameters close
to 100 nm in both DLS measurements (Figure 1B) and cryoTEM images (Figure 1C). CryoTEM images showed spherical liposomes
that were predominantly unilamellar. All liposomes had a negative
zeta potential, which is important for reducing cytotoxicity51,52 and in combination with surface PEGylation has been shown to improve
liposome diffusion throughout the vitreous.53 Lip A and Lip B showed a slightly more negative zeta potential than
Lip C (−19 mv, −18 mv, and −13 mV, respectively).
The zeta potential of all the liposomes is similar to previously reported
values of unilamellar liposomes with similar phospholipid compositions.54−56

encapsulated IGF-1, CNTF, lipopeptide OPP, and lipopeptide PTEN inhibitors
(PAP2 or PAP4); (B) liposome size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta
potential, and protein encapsulation efficiency. Liposome diameter
and PDI were measured by DLS in HBS, zeta potential was measured in
10 mM HEPES with 5% glucose. Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of spin-filter
purified liposomes was assessed by ELISA (N = 3);
(C) CryoTEM images of liposome formulations (scale bar = 100 nm).

The encapsulation efficacy (EE%)
normalized to the lipid concentration
was higher for Lip B than the EE% of Lip A, and both formulations
showed a higher EE% of CNTF (∼22 kDa) than IGF-1 (7.7 kDa).
These EE% approximately corresponded to 700 nM IGF-1 and 763 nM CNTF
concentrations for Lip A, while for Lip B the concentrations were
1.53 μM IGF-1 and 1.27 μM CNTF. These values indicate
that IGF-1 and CNTF both loaded in approximately a 1:1 ratio in both
formulations and that macromolecule size did not influence loading.
These concentrations were well above the IC50 values of IGF-1 and
CNTF (i.e., < 6 nM),57,58 while keeping the injected concentration of CNTF low enough to not
induce suppression of retina electrophysiological function.59

The difference in EE% between the two
formulations is likely to
be due to the different PTEN inhibitor lipopeptides incorporated into
the membrane. PAP2 has a cysteine with a free thiol group that can
react with other thiol groups, either from other PAP2 lipopeptides
in a liposome bilayer or on proteins (e.g., present
in FBS, IGF-1, etc.), possibly reducing protein loading
or increasing liposome leakiness during purification. This is supported
by the observation that neither Lip A or Lip B leaked calcein (a small
hydrophilic fluorescent dye) at 37 °C in HBS. However, Lip A
did leak calcein over time when 10% FBS was added to HBS at 37 °C
(Supplementary Figure S3), indicating an
interaction that resulted in liposome bilayer instability. The low
EE% ensured that the proteins were fully hydrated and did not aggregate
inside the liposomes. This is supported by the absence of visible
internal structures in the cryoTEM images in Figure 1C. The bioactivity of Lip A and Lip B was
tested in vitro in HEK293T cells (Supplementary Figure S4). Phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K
was observed for both formulations, indicating that the cargos remained
biologically active.

Liposome Uptake in Retinal Organoids
The cellular uptake
of liposomes was tested in vitro in retinal cell
organoids differentiated from mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells (Figure 2A).60 This system has advantages over traditional 2D cultures,
including more relevant pharmacokinetic results.61−63 Retinal organoids
were cultured for 21 days and then exposed to liposomes labeled with
Atto655 for 12 h. The level and cell specificity of uptake was quantified
by flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S5). The overall uptake of liposomes (Figure 2A) showed that Lip B had the lowest uptake
with approximately 13% of cells showing uptake. The control liposome,
Lip C, showed a slightly higher cellular uptake (18% of cells) than
Lip B. The highest uptake was observed for Lip A with 23% of cells
showing uptake. The variance between replicas of Lip A was significantly
larger than that of either Lip B or Lip C. Statistical analysis between
the liposome formulations was carried out, and none of the formulations
showed significantly different uptake compared to Lip C. However,
Lip A had a significantly higher uptake than Lip B. The higher uptake
observed for Lip A might be explained by sulfur–sulfur interactions
between the cysteine in PAP2 and thiol groups on the cell surface.
Cell surface thiols interacting with thiols present on nanomaterials
has been argued as a mechanism to enhance uptake into cells.64

of the total liposome uptake (as % positive cells for Atto655) in
retinal organoids (*P ≤ 0.05 between Lip A
and Lip B, N = 4). Inset shows an example micrograph
of a retinal organoid cultured to day 21 (scale bar, 1 mm). The box
plot median values are 22.6%, 12.8%, and 18.4% for Lip A, Lip B, and
Lip C, respectively. (B) Liposome uptake (as % positive cells for
Atto655) in specific cell types found in retinal organoids using cell
markers. The cell types shown are photoreceptors (recoverin), bipolar
cells (PKC-α), RGCs (RBPMS), horizontal cells (calbindin), and
Müller glia cells (glutamine synthetase (GS)). Error bars show
standard error of the mean (****P ≤ 0.0001
between Lip A and Lip B, no significant difference between cell types, N = 4).

Retinal organoids were
approximately 1 mm in diameter (Figure 2A). Retinal cells
are between 9 and 12 μm in diameter65 and assuming organoids are densely packed perfect spheres then approximately
1% of the cells are located on the organoid surface, indicating that
the liposomes were capable of moving (i.e., by active
transport and/or passive diffusion) beyond the surface layer of cells.
It has previously been reported that nanocarriers can penetrate beyond
the surface layer of cells in 3D cell aggregates.66−68 To determine
if liposome uptake was associated with specific cell types, organoids
were dissociated and stained for five major retinal cell type markers.
The markers used were antirecoverin-Rb-IgG (Chemicon) for photoreceptor
cells, anti-PKC-α-m-IgG (Santa Cruz) for bipolar cells, anti-RBPMS-Rb-IgG
(Abcam) for RGCs, anticalbindin-Rb-IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) for horizontal
cells and antiglutamine synthetase-Rb-IgG (GS) (Abcam) for Müller
glia cells.69,70 No difference in uptake between
the different cell types was observed (see Figure 2B) but it should be noted that retinal cells
are not fully mature at day 21.

In Vivo Preservation of Retinal Function by
Loaded Liposomes
RGC death was induced in the right eye of
C57BL/6J mice by a single intravitreal injection of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA, 2 μL at 20 mM). Mice
were divided into three treatment groups receiving 1 intravitreal
injection of either Lip A, Lip B, or Lip C liposomes 2 h after the
NMDA injection. Four weeks after the liposome treatment the retinal
function of dark-adapted mice were evaluated by electroretinography
(ERG) and eyes were enucleated for histological analysis (Supplementary Figure S6). NMDA treated mice receiving
empty liposomes (Lip C) were used as controls. NMDA binds irreversibly
to the NMDA receptor at the postsynaptic membrane leading to an excessive
influx of positive ions (e.g., Ca2+),
depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane and ultimately triggering
apoptosis.71−73 NMDA has shown retinal toxicity at low concentrations
(e.g., 20 nM) with the degree of inner retina damage
corresponding to NMDA concentration.74 NMDA
affects other retina cell types and intravitreal administered NMDA
also induces partial optic nerve damage, likely linked to the damage
of the inner retina. A 20 mM NMDA injection is an extreme model of
retina damage. We observed no significant difference in a-wave response
(Figure 3A), associated
with photoreceptors, between healthy control eyes and NMDA-injected
eyes. This confirmed that intravitreal NMDA injection at 20 mM concentration
did not result in photoreceptor damage, which is consistent with previous
observations.74,75

for Lip C. (B) B-wave response for healthy and treated eyes (*P ≤ 0.05 between Lip A and Lip C). Box plot median
values are 214.3 μV for healthy eye, 138.7 μV for Lip
A, 104.7 μV for Lip B, and 83.5 μV for Lip C. (C) The
change in scotopic threshold response, ΔSTR (pSTR – nSTR),
between the healthy left (oculus sinister, OS) and liposome treated
damaged right (oculus dexter, OD) eyes. Box plot median values are
27.6 μV for Lip A, 7.4 μV for Lip B, and 32.2 μV
for Lip C. Highly negative values (greater than −10 μV)
were excluded from ΔSTR assuming natural visual impairment in
the healthy control eye. N = 8–10 mice per
liposome treated group, N = 28 mice for healthy control
eye.

The b-wave response, associated
with the function of interneuron
cells (e.g., amacrine and horizontal) and bipolar
neuron cells,72,76,77 showed a significant decrease in all NMDA-injected groups (Figure 3B) compared to healthy
controls. At low concentrations (<50 nM) NMDA has been shown to
damage amacrine cells but bipolar cell damage has only been reported
for higher concentrations (>200 nM).78 At
20 mM NMDA concentrations, substantial bipolar and interneuron cell
damage will have occurred. We observed a significant protective effect
of Lip A compared to the empty liposome Lip C (P value
< 0.02). Lip B showed no significant difference in b-wave response
compared to either the Lip A or Lip C treated groups. The Lip B treated
group did show a trend which indicated a minor preservation of b-wave
response than the Lip C treated group. A-wave and b-wave amplitudes
in healthy eyes between C57BL/6J mice were similar to previous reports.79

Scotopic threshold response
(STR, Figure 3C) has
been related to the function of the inner retinal neurons more proximal
than the bipolar cells (e.g., RGCs).2,75,80,81 To estimate the neuroprotective effect, the difference in STR amplitudes
(pSTR – nSTR) between the healthy (left) and treated (right)
eye for each animal was determined (i.e., ΔSTROS-OD, Figure 3C). A lower ΔSTROS-OD therefore means a return of
function and an inner retinal neuronal response closer to the healthy
eye, with full restoration giving a ΔSTROS-OD = 0.
For ΔSTROS-OD, no significant difference was found
between the treatment groups (ANOVA p > 0.05).
However,
both Lip A and Lip B treated groups showed clear trends toward better
preservation of STR. For Lip A the spread of data points is divided
into two groups suggesting a bimodal distribution (responsive and
unresponsive), in which the responsive group has a ΔSTROS-OD of ∼7 μV. The Lip B treated group showed
a more unimodal distribution with more than 75% of the mice around
the median ΔSTROS-OD of 7.4 μV (the median
for Lip C treated group is 32.2 μV for comparison).

Extrapolation
of the ERG data would indicate that Lip A had a significant
protective effect on interneuron and bipolar neuron cells but a mixed
effect on RGCs. Conversely, Lip B showed no significant protective
effect on interneuron and bipolar cells but indicated a protective
effect on RGCs. The reasons for this observation are likely manifold.
PTEN inhibition may be a critical factor and peptides that inhibit
regions of PTEN might induce different responses in different cell
types. Equally, the concentrations of IGF-1 and CNTF needed for protection
combined with appropriate release kinetics might be specific to specific
cell types. Interestingly, NMDA activation of the p38 MAPK pathway
has been shown to be pro-apoptotic for RGCs and pro-survival for photoreceptors.82 Given IGF-1 and CNTF will promote a number of
signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK for IGF-1) and that signaling pathway
dynamics are likely different between specific cell types, loading
multiple pathway regulators into liposomes may lead to specific effects
(positive and negative) on specific cell types rather than promote
positive effects in tissue as a whole.

In Vivo Rescue of RGCs by Loaded Liposomes
To evaluate the effect
of a single intravitreal injection of Lip
A and Lip B on host RGC survival after NMDA induced RGC death, retinal
whole mounts were stained for RBPMS and imaged on a confocal microscope.
Three images per retina were acquired, approximately 1 mm away from
the optic nerve head. Example micrographs from a healthy control eye,
an eye threated with Lip A, and an eye treated with Lip C are shown
in Figure 4 panels
A, B, and C, respectively. RGCs in each image were counted and the
average number of surviving RGCs in the three images was calculated
to enable quantitative comparison between the groups (Figure 4D). NMDA injection in combination
with Lip C resulted in substantial RGC loss (∼75% loss compared
to the healthy controls). This observation is consistent with previous
quantifications of RGC loss in mice without empty liposomes.83 This result showed that Lip C did not have a
neuroprotective effect. Treatment with either Lip A or Lip B was not
able to completely prevent RGC loss.

damage of mouse retinas.
Example retina micrographs from (A) a healthy control eye; (B) a Lip
A treated eye, and (C) a Lip C treated eye. In all micrographs RGCs
nuclei were labeled with RBPMS Alexa647 (red), white scale bars are
60 μm. (D) Box and whiskers plot showing the density of surviving
RGCs in healthy and liposome treated damaged eyes (*P ≤ 0.05 between Lip A and Lip C). Each dot shows an average
RGC density for an eye, calculated from three micrographs taken 1
mm away from the optic nerve head. The box plot median values are
1728 RGCs/mm2 for the healthy eye, 553 RGCs/mm2 for Lip A, 380 RGCs/mm2 for Lip B, and 360 RGCs/mm2 for Lip C. N = 6–8 mice per group.

Statistical analysis showed a
significant difference between Lip
A and Lip C treated groups but no difference between Lip B and Lip
C treated groups (552 cells/mm2, 379 cells/mm2 and 360 cells/mm2 median values for Lip A, Lip B and
Lip C respectively). The RGC rescue data indicated that although Lip
B showed a trend to preserve the electrophysiological function associated
with RGCs, this did not translate into a greater number of rescued
RGCs. Lip A treated mice showed the greatest variance in surviving
RGCs and also showed a bimodal trend in STR. This indicates that a
number of mice within the group responded very well to the treatment
with Lip A, probably due to a range of reasons. There is a lack of
knowledge in the supportive role, if any, of amacrine and bipolar
cells on RGC survival. Given Lip A improved b-wave response (associated
with amacrine and bipolar cells) and showed the greatest number of
surviving RGCs it would indicate that amacrine and bipolar cells support
RGC survival. However, the STR for Lip A treated mice indicates that
although there are more RGCs present than in Lip B treated mice, the
function of these RGCs has been compromised.

Loaded Liposomes in Combination
with Transplant RGCs Improve
ΔSTROS-OD
We investigated the effect of
the liposomes in combination with RGC transplantation. NMDA and liposome
injections were performed as described above. Transplant RGCs (tRGCs),
differentiated from Thy1-GFP induced pluripotent cells (iPSC)84 were transplanted by intravitreal injection
4 days after NMDA injection. Retina progenitor cells and neuroretinal
cells have both been proposed as cell therapies and cell transplants
into both young animals and ex vivo retinas have
shown some success.85,86 However, good integration and
survival of transplant cells in adults remain a challenge.87 The combinatorial effect of liposomes and RGC
transplantation was evaluated by retina electrophysiological function
and donor cell survival 4 weeks after the transplantation (Figures 5 and 6). We chose Lip A as the liposome formulation due to improved
RGC survival, better b-wave response, and the indication that STR
was preserved in approximately 50% of mice.

Highly negative values (greater than −10 μV) were excluded

in the control eye. One outlier was identified in the Lip A + tRGCs
group and excluded from the statistical analysis (*P ≤ 0.05 between Lip A and Lip A + tRGCs. *P ≤ 0.05 between Lip A and Lip C + tRGCs. **P ≤ 0.01 between Lip A + tRGCs and Lip C + tRGCs). N = 8–10 mice per treated group, N = 17–44 mice for healthy control (panels A and B). N = 7–9 mice per treated group (panel C).

tRGCs = 415 RGCs/mm2) 4 weeks after NMDA injection (*P ≤ 0.05 between Lip A and Lip C). (B) Box and whiskers

(D) Example whole retina tile scan from the Lip A + tRGCs group used

and host RGCs are in red (RBPMS). White circles highlight example
areas containing tRGCs (scale bar = 1 mm, see Supplementary Figure S9 for larger image). N = 6–8 mice per group (panels A and B).

No difference in a-wave response was observed between the
healthy
eyes and the treated eyes (Figure 5A). The b-wave response showed a significant difference
between the treated groups and healthy control as well as between
the two treated groups (Figure 5B). There was no significant difference in b-wave response
between Lip A treated and Lip A in combination with tRGCs treated
mice. This result indicated that the transplant RGCs (tRGCs) did not
contribute to the b-wave response and that Lip A alone had a protective
effect. This is corroborated with the b-wave response for tRGCs combined
with Lip C, which resulted in similar b-wave amplitudes to empty liposomes
(i.e., Lip C) alone. The ΔSTROS-OD data (Figure 5C)
showed that a combination of Lip A and tRGCs resulted in a significant
rescue of RGC associated electrophysiological function (median = 3.3
μV) compared to Lip A treatment alone (median = 27.6 μV).
Lip C in combination with tRGCs showed no rescue of STR, while Lip
A in combination with tRGCs resulted in a significant improvement
in ΔSTROS-OD compared to all other treatments. The
ERG data does indicate that the loaded liposomes (Lip A) support tRGCs
in a manner that improved host STR. The observation that empty liposomes
(Lip C) in combination with tRGCs showed no rescue of STR supports
this argument. Interestingly, Lip A in combination with tRGCs significantly
reduced ΔSTROS-OD variance and eliminated the bimodal
distribution seen in Lip A alone. These results indicate that both
activation of cell growth signal pathways and the protection of other
retina cell types (e.g., amacrine, bipolar, etc.) may be critical to transplant RGCs restoring host
tissue function.

The effect of the combined treatment on host
RGCs survival was
evaluated by RBPMS staining and confocal microscopy (Figure 6). The host RGC density of
the healthy control eyes and the treated eyes are shown in Figure 6A. We were not able
to identify a significant additive effect of tRGCs on host RGC survival
(552 cells/mm2 for Lip A and 527 cells/mm2 for
Lip A + tRGCs). This indicated that it was Lip A alone that promoted
host RGC survival. Next, we investigated the effect of the liposomes
on the survival of tRGCs. Retinal whole mounts were double-stained
for GFP (marker for tRGCs) and RBPMS (host and transplant RGCs). Host
RGCs expressed RBPMS at higher levels than the tRGCs resulting in
limited colocalization of red and green fluorescence for the tRGCs.
It is worth emphasizing that the low RBPMS expression in tRGCs is
likely due to the tRGCs not yet being fully mature (Supplementary Figure S7). tRGC survival was observed in both
Lip A and Lip C groups (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S8) 4
weeks after transplantation, showing a longer survival time for tRGCs
compared to previous reports on transplanted cells.88−90

Axon
sprouting was observed in both Lip A and Lip C groups when
combined with tRGCs (Figure 6C). Surviving tRGC numbers after 1 month were very low and
no significant difference in survival of the transplanted cells was
observed between Lip A and Lip C groups. Transplant cell survival
is a major challenge in cell transplantation.87 Additionally, the NMDA induced apoptotic environment in the host
eye will have also induced tRGC apoptosis as NMDA induced toxic effects
to retina cells has been shown to have a prolonged duration (up to
14 days).74 The nonspecific (i.e., not associated with intact cells) green fluorescence observed
in the whole retina tile scans is likely GFP debris from the tRGCs
combined with tissue autofluorescence (Figure 6D). Transplant cell survival has been shown
to be improved by injury and loss of host RGCs.91 The rescue of host RGCs by Lip A may explain the lack of
an observed effect of Lip A on tRGC survival. Another possible explanation
could be linked to the timing and concentration of the delivered mTOR
pathway promoters. Delivery of growth factors at appropriate concentrations
is important for RGC survival in the neonatal retina and likely to
be critically important in inducing a significant positive effect
on the survival of transplanted cells.

Conclusion
Liposomes
loaded with multiple mTOR pathway stimulating biologics
showed a significant improvement in retina electrophysiological function
after a single injection in an NMDA mouse model with extensive retina
damage. Multifarious mTOR pathway stimulating biologic loaded liposomes
improved b-wave response and STR. These liposomes also improved host
RGC survival after NMDA exposure. Liposomes in combination with tRGCs
showed a significant improvement in STR compared to liposomes alone.
This indicated that liposomes improved the electrophysiological outcome
of the transplantation. The results show that multifarious mTOR
pathway stimulating biologic loaded liposomes can facilitate both
neuroprotection across a number of specific cell types and RGC transplantation.
Further research, particularly in dosing dynamics (e.g., modulator concentrations, modulator combinations, number of injections,
time between injections, etc.), is required to develop
clinically viable neuroprotective and transplant facilitating nanomedicines.

Methods
Lipopeptide Synthesis
All peptides were synthesized
using a Biotage Initiator Alstra peptide synthesizer (Biotage) on
a TentaGel S RAM resin (Sigma-Aldrich) at the 0.5 mmol scale using
established solid phase methods (Supplementary Figure S1).92 All chemicals (e.g., amino acids, solvents, coupling agents, etc.) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Bachem. Briefly, couplings
were 5 min at 75 °C using 4 equiv amino acid, 3.92 equiv O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate
(HATU), and 8 equiv 2,4,6-collidine in DMF. Fmoc deprotection was
done using 20% piperidine in DMF. Peptides were conjugated to palmitic
acid (C16) at the N-terminus using established HATU/collidine
coupling chemistry (1:2:4 molar ratio for palmitic acid/HATU/collidine)
to form lipopetides and cleaved from the support using trifluoroacetic
acid, water, and triisopropylsilane (95:2.5:2.5). In the case of PAP2
cleavage was performed using trifluoroacetic acid, water, triisopropylsilane
and ethanedithiol (92.5:2.5:2.5:2.5).

Lipopeptides were precipitated
in cold diethyl ether and filtered off. Crude lipopeptide was dissolved
in a acetonitrile:water (1:1) solution and purified using preparatory
HPLC (Waters) on a C18 column (Xterra). A water (5% acetonitrile,
1% trifluoroacetic acid) acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)
gradient was used starting at 10% acetonitrile and increasing to 60%
acetonitrile over 25 min. All lipopeptides had a purity ≥95%.
Lipopeptide molecular weight was confirmed using a autoflex MALDI-ToF
MS (DHB, 0.1% TFA matrix, Bruker) and purity by analytical HPLC (C8
column, Gilson). The lipopeptides had the following sequences: (OPP)
C16-PTVDVPDGRGDSLAYGLRSK; (PAP2) C16-KHKNHYKIYNLCAE; and (PAP4) C16-TVEEPSNPEASSSTSVTPD.
Lipopeptide HPLC chromatograms and MALDI-ToF MS spectra can be found
in the Supporting Information (Supplementary
Figure S2).

Preparation of Liposomes and Loading of Proteins
All
lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and had a purity of
≥98%. Liposomes were prepared by dissolving pure lipids in
9:1 tertiary butanol/water and then pipetting them together to give
the relevant lipid mixtures. The lipid mixtures were then lyophilized
to dry lipid powders overnight using freeze-drying. The lipid powders
were subsequently hydrated over 1 h by adding 10 mM HEPES buffered
saline pH = 7.4 (HBS) at 60 °C and shaking every 10 min. The
liposomes were extruded through a 100 nm pore size filter 21 times
at 60 °C and stored at 4 °C until use. Liposomes were composed
of 1,2-dipalmetoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcoline
(DPPC), cholesterol (Chol), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium salt (DPPE-PEG2000),
OPP, and PAP2 or PAP4. Liposome A (Lip A) comprised DPPC/Chol/DPPE-PEG2000/OPP
and PAP2 in a 53:40:5:1:1 mol % ratio. In liposome B (Lip B), PAP2
was replaced with PAP4 at the same mol %, all other lipid percentages
were the same. A control liposome (Lip C) without any proteins or
lipopeptides had a composition of DPPC/Chol/DPPE-PEG2000 (55:40:5
mol %).

The proteins were loaded into preformed liposomes following
established methods.93 Briefly, CNTF and
IGF-1 (recombinant human CNTF and recombinant human IGF-1, Cell Guidance
Systems) were dissolved in HBS at 0.25 mg/mL and mixed with liposomes.
The mixture was snap frozen in liquid N2 and thawed in
a water bath at 37 °C, this process was repeated once. Nonencapsulated
proteins were removed by spin-filtration with a 100 kDa spin filter
(Merck), using HBS as eluent. The concentration of encapsulated protein
was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems) following the instructions
of the manufacturer. Lipid concentrations were detected by ICP-MS
(Thermo Scientific). Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of the CNTF and
IGF-1 was determined by normalizing the protein concentration before
and after purification to the actual lipid concentration, as described
in eq 1. 1  Normalizing protein concentration to lipid
concentration, rather than describing EE% as a change in protein concentration
only, takes into account changes in volume from purification steps.

Liposome Characterization by DLS and Zeta-Potential
Liposome
hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential were measured on
a Brookhaven ZetaPALS. For size measurements liposomes were diluted
in HBS. Zeta-potential was measured on liposomes diluted in 10 mM
HEPES, 5% glucose at pH 7.4.

In Vitro Liposome Stability
Liposome
stability was evaluated at 4 °C by following changes in size
and polydispersity index (PDI) of loaded liposomes over time. Sizes
and PDI were measured by DLS as described above. The ability of the
liposomes to retain the loaded content was assessed by encapsulation
of a self-quenching concentration (20 mM) of the hydrophilic fluorophore,
calcein (Sigma-Aldrich). Liposomes were formulated as described above,
adding 20 mM calcein in HBS for hydration of the lipid powder. Nonencapsulated
calcein was removed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Sephadex
G50 column using HBS. The calcein loaded liposomes were then split
into different vials, kept at 4 or 37 °C. A 100 μL aliquot
of each sample at a concentration of 0.1 mM was subsequently transferred
to a black flat bottom 96 well plate, and the fluorescent signal was
measured in a plate reader (Wallac Victor3 1420 Multilabel Counter) before and after lysing the liposomes with
2 μL of 10% Triton X (Sigma-Aldrich). The ratio of the fluorescent
signal of lysed liposomes over intact liposomes was then plotted against
time to generate a leakage profile.

Bioactivity assay of liposomes
by Western Bolt
To test
the ability of Lip A and Lip B to influence the mTOR/Akt pathway,
HEK293T (Sigma-Aldrich) cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma)
and 5% penicillin–streptomycin in a six well plate was incubated
for 12 h with 0.4 mM liposomes at 37 °C 5% CO2. Cells
incubated with Lip C were used as a control. Semiquantitative analysis
for Akt activation was performed by Western blot (WB) following standard
protocol. In brief, cells were washed with cold PBS and collected
by mechanical scraping in 200 μL of cold PBS, with phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and complete Mini EDTA free protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were transferred to clean 1.5 mL
tubes kept on ice. The cells were lysed by adding 200 μL of
hot (∼96 °C) 4× protein loading buffer (Li-Cor) with
10% mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and the mixture was boiled for
5 min before loading 15 μL of the whole cell lysate in a 1.5
mm Nu PAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen). Five microliters
of chameleon 700 prestained protein ladder (Li-Cor) was loaded in
the outermost wells. Electrophoresis was run at 100 V in Nu PAGE running
buffer (Invitrogen) for 2 h.

The proteins were transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) in 25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine,
and 20% methanol buffer at pH 8.3. The nitrocellulose membrane was
blocked with odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature,
washed with Tris buffered saline (Sigma-Aldrich) 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich)
(TBST), and stained with anti-Akt1-Rb-IgG (abcam) overnight at 4 °C.
The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with secondary
stain Gt-anti-Rabbit IgG DyLight 800 (Invitrogen) before imaging the
membrane on an Odyssey FC imaging system (Li-Cor). The antibody was
then stripped using Revitablot Western blot stripping buffer (Rockland)
before reblocking, and staining overnight with anti-Akt1/2/3-Rb-IgG
(Abcam) at 4 °C. Akt1/2/3 was labeled with IRDye 680RD Gt-anti-Rb
(Li-Cor) and imaged. The same methodology was used for p70S6 kinase,
except anti-p70S6K-Rb-IgG (Invitrogen), and anti-Phospho-p70S6K (Thr421,
Ser424)-Rb-IgG (Invitrogen) were used. Densitometry was made by drawing
rectangles over appropriate bands, obtaining the intensity, and dividing
the intensity by the control (e.g., Akt1/2/3 or p70S6K).

Culture of Retinal Organoids
Murine embryonic stem
cells (mESCs) were thawed and seeded in T75 flasks precoated with
1% Matrigel in DMEM for 20 min. Cells were cultured in ESC maintenance
medium (ES medium, see Supporting Information for all media components), at 37 °C, 5% O2, 5% CO2, until 80% confluency. Cells were then collected by trypsinization
and seeded in 96 tissue culture plates (Falcon Corning) at 20 000
cells/well in optic vesicle media (OV-medium) (Day 1). After seeding
on day 2, 1% Matrigel in 50 μL of OV medium was added to each
well. At day 5, 100 μL of 0.5% Matrigel in OV medium was added.
Day 9, 100 μL of media from each well was replaced with 100
μL of optic cup medium (OC-medium) without disturbing the cell
aggregate. The retinal organoids were maintained by replacing 100 μL
of medium per well with fresh OC-medium every third day until the
optic cups were used at Day 21 after seeding.

Liposome Uptake in Retinal
Organoids
For in
vitro uptake studies, liposomes with the same membrane composition
as Lip A, Lip B, and Lip C were prepared adding 0.5 mol % of the fluorescently
labeled lipid (DPPE-Atto655). Optic cups at Day 21, were pooled 6
to a well and ∼100 optic cups per formulation were incubated
with 400 μM liposomes in OC-medium for 12 h. The 100 aggregates
were then collected in a Falcon tube and washed twice with 10 mL of
Hanks buffered saline solution (HBSS). Cells were dissociated by adding
10 mL of Trypsin-EDTA 1X (T = 37 °C). Optic
cups were mechanically disturbed by pipetting and vortexing periodically,
during the 5 min trypsin incubation in a 37 °C heat bath. The
trypsin was inhibited by adding an equivalent volume of medium. Cells
were then pelleted and resuspended in 500 μL of HBSS before
passing through a cell strainer. Cells were fixed by incubation for
30 min on ice in 1.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells
were washed with 12 mL of PBS and resuspended in 3 mL of blocking
buffer; 0.05% Digitonin (5% in water, Invitrogen), 10% goat serum,
0.1% sodium citrate, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, for 30
min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 12 mL of PBS
and the pellet was resuspended in appropriate volume of staining buffer.
Cells were then divided into a 350 μL microwell plate and incubated
with an appropriate amount of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C.
Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary
antibody, (antimouse-Alexa488 or antirabit-Alexa488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch))
for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS
and resuspended in 250 μL of PBS. Cell uptake was evaluated
by flow cytometer on a BD LSR II (BD Bioscience), collecting data
in the APC-A and FITC channel, analyzing 10.000 events per sample.

In Vivo Efficacy of Liposomes and Progenitor
Cell Transplants
All animal experiments were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Schepens
Eye Research Institute. C57BL/6J (Charles River Laboratories) mice
were kept on a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle. Food and water were provided
ad libitum. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection
of 100–200 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine (Accutome).
Under anesthesia the mice were given one eye drop of tropicamide and
one intravitreal injection of 2 μL of 20 mM N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) in the right eye, using a
100 μm diameter glass pipet.94−96 Care was taken not to
injure the lens during the procedure. The left eye was kept as contralateral
control. After the procedure GenTeal was applied to both eyes. Two
h after injection of NMDA, mice were anesthetized by isofluorane inhalation
using O2 as the carrier gas. Mice were then given one 2
μL intravitreal injection of 10 mM liposome suspension of either
Lip A, Lip B, or empty Lip C, into the right eye. GenTeal was applied
to the injected eye. Four days after NMDA injection, three groups
were anesthetized by IP injection of 100–200 mg/kg ketamine
and 20 mg/kg xylazine and transplanted with 20 000 GFP+ transplant RGCs by intravitreal injection of 2 μL of
cell suspension in PBS. Four weeks after transplantation ERGs were
recorded, mice were euthanized, and eyes were collected.

GFP Expressing
RGCs for Transplantations
RGC differentiation,
isolation, and selection were performed as described before.84 Briefly, murine Thy1-GFP iPSCs, kindly provided
by the laboratory of Joshua Sanes, were differentiated into retinal
tissue in three-dimensional retinal organoids through 21 days culture
following the retinal organoid protocol described above. At day 21
aggregates were collected washed with HBSS and dissociated with freshly
activated papain in 1.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5.5
mM cysteine-HCl in 50 mL of HBSS preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C,
5% CO2, 5 mL per 500 aggregates. Aggregates were left in
active papain for 3 min, vortexing thoroughly to mechanically dissociate
the cells. The cell suspension was then mixed 1:1 with DTI–benzonase
and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer. The strainer was washed
with an equal volume of DTI–benzonase, and cells were spun
down and resuspended in RGC medium (see Supporting Information). GFP+ RGCs were isolated using magnetic
beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) with anti-Thy1, following the instructions
of the manufacturer. Cells were counted using Trypan-blue staining,
suspended in HBSS.

Electroretinography
The function
of retinal ganglion
cells was assessed by electroretinography (ERG)-scotopic threshold
response (STR) using a Diagnosys Espion 3 system with Ganzfield bowl.
C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories) were dark-adapted overnight
prior to recordings. The mice were anesthetized by IP injection of
100–200 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine and placed on
a heating pad to maintain temperature throughout the recordings. Pupils
were dilated in both eyes by one drop of tropicamide. GelTal (hypromellose)
was applied to the eyes to ensure conduction to the electrodes. The
reference electrode (needle) was placed subcutaneously in the forehead
and measuring electrodes (gold loops) were placed on the corneas.
For the stimulation, a series of white flashes were used at 0.0001,
0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 5 cd-s/m2 intensities with mice exposed
to 5 flashes per intensity with a 30 s recovery in between each flash.
Electroretinograms were recorded with positive STR, negative STR,
for which a- and b-waves were analyzed. The STR data shown in this
paper were obtained under 0.001 cd-s/m2 flash intensities
while the a-wave and b-wave data were obtained for 0.1 cd-s/m2. These flash intensities produced electroretinograms with
the best signal-to-noise ratio.

Immunohistochemistry and
Confocal Imaging
Eyes from
euthanized mice were collected in PBS and fixed in 4% PFA overnight.
Retinas were carefully dissected under a microscope. Retinas were
blocked with 10% goat serum overnight at room temperature. Retinas
were then washed with 0.1% triton × 0.1% tween 20 in PBS three
times before incubation with anti-RBPMS-Rb-IgG (Abcam) and anti-GFP-m-igG
(Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. After they were washed three times
as described above, the retinas were incubated with antimouse-Alexa647
and antirabit-Alexa488 1 h at room temperature. Lastly the retinas
were washed, incubated with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI in PBS for 1 min
at room temperature, and washed again before mounting on glass slides
using 9% poly vinyl-alcohol, 22% glycerol, 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
in 88 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5.

Slides were imaged on a Leica TCS
SP5 confocal microscope using a 40× oil emission objective. The
predefined settings for the dyes used were chosen in the Leica software.
Sequential scanning was used to avoid spillover between the DAPI channel
and the Alexa488 channel. Retinas were imaged approximately 1 mm from
the optic nerve head. To quantify surviving host RGS, z-stacks of
approximately 16 μm with a step size of 0.5 μm were collected.
Stacks were z-projected to form one image in ImageJ.
2–3 images were obtained per retina. Surviving RGCs were counted
manually. To evaluate survival of transplanted RGCs that might be
heterogeneously distributed across the retina, the whole retina was
imaged using a Zeiss Axio Scan Z.1 slide scanner (20× objective).
Signals were recorded in the 488, 560, and 647 nm channels. To eliminate
some of the green autofluorescence from the retina, the signal from
the 560 nm channel was subtracted from the 488 nm channel before counting
the green cells in Zeiss Zen Blue and Black lite software. Cells were
counted manually.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed
using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The following statistical methods
were used to analyze the biological data: (Figure 2A) one-way ANOVA post hoc Tukey HSD test;
(Figure 2B) two-way
ANOVA; (Figure 3A)
one-way ANOVA, no significance; (Figure 3B) one-way ANOVA post hoc Tukey HSD test;
(Figure 3C) Kruskal–Wallis,
no significance; (Figure 4D) one-way ANOVA post hoc Tukey HSD; (Figure 5A) one-way ANOVA, no significance; (Figure 5B) one-way ANOVA
post hoc Tukey HSD test; (Figure 5C) Kruskal–Wallis post hoc Dunn’s test;
(Figure 6A) One-way
ANOVA post hoc Tukey HSD; (Figure 6B) Unpaired t test, no significance.
The threshold of statistical significance (alpha) for all analyses
was 0.05. Distribution curves and quantile–quantile (Q–Q)
plots were used to determine whether data sets were parametric or
nonparametric. Statistical significance between healthy control eyes
and treated eyes was significant and not shown for clarity.
