The
uptake and sorption of charged molecules by responsive polymer
membranes and hydrogels in aqueous solutions is of key importance
for the development of soft functional materials. Here, we investigate
the partitioning of simple monatomic (Na+, K+, Cs+, Cl–, I–) and
one molecular ion (4-nitrophenolate; NP–) within
a dense, electroneutral poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
membrane using explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. Inside
the predominantly hydrophobic environment, water distributes in a
network of polydisperse water nanoclusters. The average cluster size
determines the mean electrostatic self-energy of the simple ions,
which preferably reside deeply inside them; we therefore find substantially
larger partition ratios K ≃10–1 than expected from a simple Born picture using a uniform dielectric
constant. Despite their irregular shapes, we observe that the water
clusters possess a universal negative electrostatic potential with
respect to their surroundings, as is known for aqueous liquid–vapor
interfaces. This potential, which we find concealed in cases of symmetric
monatomic salts, can dramatically impact the transfer free energies
of larger charged molecules because of their weak hydration and increased
affinity to interfaces. Consequently, and in stark contrast to the
simple ions, the molecular ion NP– can have a partition
ratio much larger than unity, K ≃10–30
(depending on the cation type) or even 103 in excess of
monovalent salt, which explains recent observations of enhanced reaction
kinetics of NP– reduction catalyzed within dense
polymer networks. These results also suggest that ionizing a molecule
can even enhance the partitioning in a collapsed, rather hydrophobic
gel, which strongly challenges the traditional simplistic reasoning.

==== Body
The principal
factor in the
design of polymer membranes and hydrogels used in applications for
water purification, pervaporation, drug delivery, nanocarriers, etc. is the capability to control the uptake and permeability
of different molecular species.1−9 For instance, the ability to control the permeability of ions makes
such materials interesting for water purification technologies, such
as reverse and forward osmosis.10,11 A separation is achieved
between different penetrants because of the distinction in the amount
of material that dissolves in the membrane and the rate at which the
material diffuses through the membrane.2,12 A recent modification
of forward osmosis, where the hydrogel acts as the draw solute (osmotic
agent) and the separation membrane at the same time,13−15 exploits the difference of the salt concentration inside the hydrogel
in its swollen and collapsed (or compressed) state and can be used
to yield low-salinity water upon repeating the cycle.13

As an alternative to mechanical compression, thermoresponsive
shrinking
of a hydrogel can be utilized for desalination purposes.12,16,17 Thermoresponsive polymers, such
as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), undergo
a transition from good to poor solvent conditions upon an increase
in temperature or triggered by some other environmental stimulus,
which results in substantial shrinkage of the gel.18−21 An advantage of responsive hydrogels
in purification lies in simple separation by filtration methods and
their reusability. Thus, polymer membranes are expected to continue
to dominate the water purification technologies owing to their energy
efficiency.12,22

Hydrogels are also particularly
appealing materials for drug delivery
systems as they can be designed in numerous ways in order to selectively
encapsulate and release particular types of pharmacologically relevant
molecules in a controllable manner.8 For
charged drugs, the electrostatic interactions, facilitated by accompanying
ions, are an important, if not dominating, driving force for the transport
through the gel.23 Related phenomena are
exploited in adaptive nanocatalysis where catalytic nanoparticles
are confined in a permeable hydrogel that can be potentially employed
as a programmable nanoreactor to shelter and control the catalytic
process.24−28 Since most of the penetrating molecules in these applications, such
as salt, ligands, and reactants, are charged, the understanding and
control of the behavior of simple and molecular ions inside hydrogels
are critical for the development of high-performance materials for
the applications mentioned above.

Two basic quantities that
need first attention here are the solubility
and the mobility (or diffusivity) of the molecules inside the polymer.
The solubility is usually simply expressed by the partition ratio K, which describes the ratio between mean solute concentrations
inside the membrane and in bulk.29 The
product of partitioning and diffusivity defines the membrane permeability
within the linear response solution–diffusion model.2 In fact, because of a lower water content, a
collapsed hydrogel exhibits an apparently more hydrophobic environment
than in the swollen state; therefore, the partitioning of ions is
typically below unity (that is, below bulk concentration).30 In a simple Born solvation picture, one could
argue that the mean dielectric constant in a dense hydrogel is an
order of magnitude lower than in bulk water, and thus, the transfer
from bulk is strongly penalized by a lack of polarization. This penalty
(see eq 2 later) would
lead to partition ratios orders of magnitude smaller than observed
for simple salts such as NaCl,30 a fact
that is essentially unexplained. More strikingly, more complex, molecular
ions exhibit a much larger span of partitioning values, in some cases
(e.g., small ionized drugs) even exceeding unity by orders of magnitude, K ≃ 103, in collapsed hydrogels.23,31 This clearly eludes any simple electrostatic and mean-field mechanisms.
Hence, despite a rich history of research on synthetic gels and ion
exchange polymers, the present knowledge still does not suffice for
quantitative, predictive connections between the polymer structure
and the thermodynamics of ion solvation in dense membranes.1,10,22

The reason for the lack
of understanding must be sought in the
complex interplay between water, ions, and the polymer matrix on the
molecular level, particularly in dense polymers and collapsed hydrogels,
where a very crowded and heterogeneous molecular environment can be
expected.32 In fact, it has been shown
by us recently using molecular simulations that the water–polymer
spatial heterogeneity in a collapsed PNIPAM polymer affects the distribution
of neutral solutes;33 therefore, one may
anticipate something similar for ions. We studied previously also
the diffusion of ions in the same dense polymer matrix where magnitude
and scaling of diffusion with ionic size were very different from
nonpolar solutes,34 which could be clearly
traced back to local hydration effects. When comparing the interaction
and adsorption of simple monatomic ions and molecular ions35 to a single PNIPAM chain, we observed that the
former were repelled from the chain and stayed nicely hydrated in
bulk, while the latter could easily adsorb to the chain. Hence, ionic
solvation in a dense, weakly hydrated polymer matrix is not easily
accessible and is challenging to categorize without a deeper molecular
level understanding.

In this study, we aim for such a detailed
understanding of the
problem of ion partitioning in the dense, weakly hydrated polymers
by using classical molecular dynamics simulations. As a case study
we choose the popular PNIPAM polymer in the collapsed state, above
the transition temperature, where the water amount is low (20 wt %).
We perform a detailed analysis of ionic solvation free energies in
bulk water and in the membrane as well as of hydration structure in
the polymer matrix. We discuss in detail the electrostatic contributions
to the salt and ionic partition ratios and devise a simple solvation
theory that explains the simulation outcomes. At the end we devote
special attention to the comparison of simple monatomic ions to the
molecular ion 4-nitrophenolate (NP–), which behaves
markedly different because of weaker hydration and its affinity to
the heterogeneous nanosized interfaces within the membrane. This study
thus provides molecular insight into ion partitioning in a dense polymer
and will be helpful for the interpretation of various experimental
data, directly or indirectly related to ionic concentrations inside
the polymeric functional material.

Results and Discussion
Background
The uptake of salt ions and larger charged
(druglike) molecules by a hydrogel depends crucially on the molecular
details (the “chemistry”) of the polymer matrix. It
is characterized by the partition ratio K(29) and is for low enough concentrations independent
of the concentration.

In Figure 1 we show the correlation between the NaCl salt (K(salt)) and water (Kw) partition ratios (the latter defined as the ratio of water densities
inside and outside the gel) for several uncharged polymers reported
in the literature. Here, the primary polymer [methacrylate,36 cellulose acetate,37 silicone,30 PNIPAM,38 or polyethylene glycol (PEG)39−41] was cross-linked and
either exposed to different temperatures or copolymerized with other
monomers in order to tune the equilibrium water content. Quite generally,
the uptake of salt by a polymer depends to some extent on water amount;
polymers that sorb more water often tend to sorb more salt than those
polymers that sorb less water.42 Also,
most of the data fall below the dashed line, depicting an apparent
limiting case of K(salt) = Kw where the salt concentration in the sorbed water is
equal to that in bulk water.36 However,
since mostly K(salt) < Kw, this indicates that both polymer–ion and polymer–water
interactions influence salt partitioning.

Figure 1 Correlation between NaCl
partition ratio, K(salt), and the water
partition ratio, Kw, for several polymers
reported in the literature: methacrylate,36 cellulose acetate,37 silicone,30 PNIPAM,38 and PEG39−41 at different temperatures or with different degrees
of copolymerization.

On the other hand, larger
charged molecules (e.g., ionized drugs)
exhibit a much larger span of partitioning values, in some cases even
exceeding K = 103 in collapsed hydrogels.23,31 This clearly eludes the empirical observations for monatomic salts
and calls for additional mechanisms, which we will address in this
study.

Transfer Free Energies
In this computer simulation
study, we use a model of a collapsed PNIPAM polymer phase above the
transition temperature with the water partition ratio Kw = 0.2 (see Figure 2A for a single extended polymer chain). This is also
a good model of a collapsed hydrogel with very low (few percent) cross-linker
concentrations. A typical simulation snapshot is shown in Figure 2B with 48 polymer
chains in blue and 1325 water molecules in red–white. Removing
the polymer component from the plot (Figure 2C) reveals that water molecules are very
nonuniformly distributed, forming irregular, lacy-like clusters, which
engender a heterogeneous polar–nonpolar environment. Such water
clustering and aggregation are otherwise well-known to occur in various
amorphous polymer structures.43−47 The radius of gyration Rg of the clusters
in our system scales with the number of water molecules Nw as Rg ∼ Nw1/2 and
hence retains some characteristic of the random walk. More details
about the structure can be found elsewhere.34

three chloride ions, showing (B) all components and (C) water and
ions only. The blue bubble zooms into the proximity of one of the
Cl– ions, featuring its hydration shell.

For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the solvation of
monovalent
ions: three alkali metal cations (sodium, potassium, and cesium),
two halides (chloride and iodide), and a molecular ion 4-nitrophenolate
(NP–), which is 4-nitrophenol (NP0) with
a deprotonated hydroxyl group, see Figure 2A. Nitrophenol became popular in model reactions
in nanocatalytic benchmark experiments and was also used in a connection
with PNIPAM hydrogels.27

In order
to analyze the ionic partitioning we resort to free energy
calculations (see the Methods section). Note
that a direct evaluation of K in our system is not
tractable due to a very slow diffusion of ions (see the Methods section). Figure 3 shows the evaluated solvation free energies of single
ions in water (Gw, blue triangle symbols)
and in the gel (Gg, orange square symbols).
They are negative and comparable in size (of the order of several
−100 kJ/mol). Their difference corresponds to the central quantity
of interest in this study, namely, to the transfer free energy from
water into the gel, ΔG = Gg – Gw. Note that ΔG represents the real single-ion solvation
free energy because it is the one encompassing the totality of the
reversible work associated with the physical process of transferring
the ion from water into the gel. In general, the experimental determination
of single-ion solvation free energies is complicated because of the
electroneutrality of macroscopic matter.54 Note that the gel–water interface potential is not included
in ΔG because it is screened by ions sufficiently
away from the interface compared with the Debye screening length (see
the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Free energies
of ions: solvation free energy in water (Gw), solvation free energy in PNIPAM gel (Gg), and the transfer free energy from water
into the gel (ΔG = Gg – Gw). For all monatomic ions
we use the Jorgensen force field48−50 and additionally *Åqvist51 for Na+ and †Dang52,53 for I–.

The computed values of ΔG are depicted by
red circles in Figure 3. Evidently, we are confronting a very surprising and important observation:
there is a stark contrast between the cations and anions in terms
of their transfer free energies, ΔG! Systematically,
all the monatomic anions span in the narrow window 50–70 kJ/mol
and are thus intrinsically repelled from the gel, whereas cations
cover the negative range between −30 and −40 kJ/mol
and should be attracted by the gel. This difference stretches far
beyond ion-specific effects (interpreted as the variation among different
ions and force fields of the same valency). Note that NP–, as a molecular ion, includes additional contributions and will
be discussed separately.

This is surprising since in the traditional
view one expects that
charged entities should be universally repelled from a less polarizable
medium. Furthermore, also atomistic simulation studies of isolated
PNIPAM polymers and swollen networks utilizing similar or even the
same force fields35,55,56 show a universal repulsion of small cations and anions from the
chains. Somehow, the aggregation of the polymers and expulsion of
water (from excess of water down to 20 wt % in our case) inverts the
scenario for cations but not for anions. Because the effect is triggered
by reducing the water amount, this also suggests that the cation–anion
asymmetry does most probably not stem from polymer–ion interactions
but rather has something to do with the water structure and its amount.

Monatomic ions
We will first focus on the mechanisms
operative in the solvation of monatomic ions. For that, we begin by
taking a closer look into the structural properties of the solvation.
It has already been shown that the water–polymer spatial heterogeneity
in this collapsed polymer affects the distribution of neutral solutes;33 therefore, one can expect a related behavior
for ions. Indeed, already glancing at the representative snapshot
in Figure 2C reveals
that ions (Cl– in this case) enclose themselves
with clusters of water molecules. To put this into a quantitative
perspective, we analyze the local water densities around the ions
in bulk water and in the gel phase, see Figure 4A. The main peak, corresponding to the first
hydration shell, does not weaken that much upon entering from water
into the gel. Instead, the ions preserve their first hydration shell
even though the mean water density in PNIPAM is only around one-fifth
that in the bulk. We conclude that the ions mostly distribute within
the aqueous nanoclusters.

water (dotted lines)
and PNIPAM (solid lines). (B) Ion-hydrating cluster size distribution
for different ions (symbols) and size distribution of all water clusters
in the gel (dashed line). The green-shaded region indicates the mean
ion-hydrating cluster size. (C) Continuum picture of an ion encapsulated
by a water cluster of an effective radius rw embedded into a hydrogel environment.

Further understanding of the extent of the surrounding water can
be obtained by analyzing the hydrating clusters around the ions. We
define a water cluster as the group of the water molecules that are
mutually separated by less than 0.35 nm. An ion resides in a cluster
if it is separated from any of the water molecules of the cluster
by less than 0.4 nm. Figure 4B shows the size distributions of all water clusters (dashed
line) in the gel as well as ion-hydrating clusters (symbols), which
are the clusters formed around ions. The distribution of water clusters
first roughly follows a power-law34P(Nw) ∼ Nw–1.74 and crosses over into a roughly exponential decay for larger clusters
(Nw > 100). Similarly, the distribution
of ion-hydrating clusters also approximately follows an exponential
decay for Nw > 10. The mean ion-hydrating
cluster size is ⟨Nw⟩ = 120–160,
indicated by a green-shaded stripe in Figure 4B. However, the probability of very small
ion-hydrating clusters rapidly decays to zero for Nw < 10, indicating that an ion does not very likely
become dehydrated. Another important observation is that the results
do not reveal any significant difference between the cations and anions
within the accuracy of the data—all the ions behave very similarly.

For the purposes of a simple analysis, we convert the mean ion-hydrating
cluster size ⟨Nw⟩ into an
equivalent size of a spherical water droplet of the bulk water density
(ρw = 32.2 nm–3) 1  which results in
the effective droplet size
of rw = 0.96–1.06 nm.

A traditional
mode of thinking about ionic solvation is based on
the continuum picture of the Born free energy,57 which is particularly powerful for estimating partitioning
in homogeneous liquids.58 In this framework,
the water and the gel phases are regarded as homogeneous background
media with relative permittivities εw and εg, respectively. The transfer free energy is then associated
with the change of the Born free energy of an ion with charge q as57,59−61 2  

Here, aB is the effective Born
radius
of the ion,62,63 which characterizes its effective
size, usually regarded as the location of the first hydration layer.
The first hydration layer can be deduced from water density distributions
around the ions (aB = 0.23–0.36
nm, cf.Figure 4A). Using evaluated values for the relative permittivities
in our model, εw = 67 for bulk water and εg = 8.5 for the gel (see the Methods section), we obtain ΔGB = 20–30
kJ/mol. However, since in our system the ions in the gel are encapsulated
by water clusters (Figure 4C shows a simplified picture), the effective Born radius should
rather reflect the size of the ion along with its hydration shell
of effective size rw. In other words,
upon the transfer of an ion from water into the gel, the dielectric
environment around the ion changes only beyond the radial distance
of r = aB. Therefore,
we can conveniently assume aB = 1 nm in eq 2, which gives us ΔGB = +7 kJ/mol for both cations and anions. Note
that eq 2 is symmetric
on the sign of the ionic charge q and strictly positive
as long as εw > εg.

The
analysis thus far demonstrated no differences in the structure
and distribution of monatomic ions inside the gel. Since ions are
enclosed by rather bulky water clusters, this raises the question
of the influence of these clusters on the containing charge. An effect
that is not accounted for in the implicit Born solvation model is
the polarization of water clusters, which comes about due to preferential
orientation of water molecules at the cluster interface. The polarization
at the cluster interface arises from the fact that the water molecules
in this region are subject to an anisotropic environment.

To
answer this question, we evaluate the electrostatic potential
inside water clusters of various sizes (Figure 5A). The radial dependence of the potential
from the center of a cluster is plotted in Figure 5B for three different cluster sizes. Interestingly,
in spite of an irregular, not well-defined shape, the interior of
a cluster seems to universally acquire a well-defined potential of
ψcl ≈ −0.5 V with respect to the surrounding
“dry” part of the gel. In the same plot we also indicate
the potential drop across the planar macroscopic PNIPAM–water
boundary (ψs = −0.53 V, as obtained from separate
simulations, see the Supporting Information). Already a few water molecules (Nw ∼
10) are enough to generate the potential drop in the center that is
almost equivalent to the drop across macroscopically large interface.
This means that an ion enclosed in a cluster is directly subjected
to the potential drop at the interface. Cations gain a favorable negative
contribution of eψcl = −49
kJ/mol, whereas anions are penalized by this same amount, +49 kJ/mol.

Figure 5 (A) Snapshots
of water clusters of various sizes Nw in
PNIPAM. (B) Radial dependence of the electrostatic
potential from the center of a water cluster. The horizontal dashed
line shows the potential drop across a planar PNIPAM–water
interface, ψs, where the thickness of the shaded
region represents the numerical uncertainty (see the Supporting Information). (C) Snapshots of water droplets of
various sizes Nw in vapor. (D) Radial
dependence of the electrostatic potential from the center of a water
droplet. The horizontal dashed line shows the potential drop across
a planar vapor–water interface.

The phenomenon of the interface potential is well-known from the
context of the water–vapor and water–oil interface.54,64−71 For the sake of comparison we also show a similar analysis for water
nanodroplets in vapor (Figure 5C,D). In all the droplets, even the smallest one (composed
of 10 molecules), the potential reaches around −0.6 V with
respect to vapor, which is the same as the potential drop at a planar
water–vapor interface (horizontal dashed line). The analysis
of potential inside the clusters and droplets shows a similar behavior
and reveals essentially the same physics. Note that the potential
profiles tend to smear out for larger clusters because the center
of a larger cluster may reside outside the cluster owing to its random-walk
shape.

In Figure 6A we
again plot the transfer free energies from the simulations (red circles)
along with the contribution from the cluster potential, ±eψcl (blue dashed lines). Clearly, the
cluster potential alone already roughly captures the difference of
simulation data between the monatomic cations and anions. The remaining
deviations can be reconciled by adding the Born solvation component, 3  

Figure 6 (A) Transfer free energies
of ions from simulations (red circles);
the same as in Figure 3. The blue dashed
lines depict the values ±eψcl, the green solid lines are the predictions of eq 3 for monatomic ions, and the orange lines
are the predictions of eq 8 with α = 0.7 and 1 for NP–. (B) Partition
ratios K from simulations computed viaeq 5 assuming 1:1 electrolytes
for different cation–anion combinations (symbols). The green
line is the prediction of eq 7, and the orange lines are the predictions of eq 9 with α = 0.73 and 1 for combinations
involving NP–. The results are based on the Jorgensen
force field for ions,48−50 and where marked additionally *Åqvist51 for Na+ and †Dang52,53 for I–.

Accepting the Born part of 7 kJ/mol (assuming aB = 1 nm in eq 2), the predictions of eq 3 are plotted by solid green lines in Figure 6A and capture the data very well.

With
the transfer free energy at hand, we are finally in the position
to tackle the ion partitioning. The individual partition
ratio of ion i is defined as the Boltzmann factor
of its transfer free energy 4  which does not include collective
electrostatic
effects from other ions and should not be confused with the partition
ratio K(i) of ion i. Because of the electroneutrality requirements in the
gel, the partitionings K(i) of different ion species are coupled and depend on the electrolyte
composition (see the Supporting Information). In the simplest case of a 1:1 electrolyte, the concentrations
of cations (+) and anions (−) are equal, and their collective
partition ratio is given as the geometric mean of both individual
partition ratios 5  

In Figure 6B we
plot the salt partitioning obtained from the simulation transfer free
energy data (symbols) for all combinations of cation and anion species
of a 1:1 salt. For the monatomic combinations, the partition ratios
fall inside the window K(salt) = 0.04–0.2,
which is also in the range of reported experimental values for numerous
polymers (including PNIPAM) with a water content of Kw = 0.2 (Figure 1).

An important observation is also that partitioning
does not significantly
depend on the type of salt (i.e., ion-specific effects are below the
numerical resolution), which is in line with simulation studies of
core–shell PNIPAM membranes72 as
well as with experimental observations.38 An easy explanation for this weak ion specificity based on our picture
(Figure 4C) is that
their specific character is shielded by the surrounding strongly bound
hydration shell; that is, the microenvironment does not specifically
change upon insertion into the polymer. However, we can further speculate
that the ion specificity may come forth once the hydration cluster
starts to vanish, which may happen at even lower hydrations or for
larger and more chaotropic ions.

For further discussions, it
is useful to define the cluster-potential
partition ratio 6  which represents a hypothetical
partition
ratio of a cation solely due to the cluster potential, and conversely Kcl–1 ≃ 3.0 × 10–8 for an anion. However,
these enormous values are not disclosed in the total salt partitioning,
since they exactly cancel out (cf.eq 5). This is because of equal amounts
of cations and anions that are enclosed by the clusters, and therefore,
the cluster potential remains “concealed”. Namely, the
theoretical approximation given by eq 3 together with eq 5 for a monovalent salt leads to 7  where only the contribution
from the Born
solvation survives and yields K(salt) ≃
0.08. This value, indicated by a green solid line in Figure 6B, matches the simulation values
for the monatomic ions considerably well. For a comparison, the standard
homogeneous Born solvation approach, where one uses the position of
the first hydration shell as the effective Born radius, which then
yields the Born part of 20–30 kJ/mol (see above), results in
substantially too low values of K(salt) ≃ 10–5–10–3.

The modified Born solvation model (eq 2) furthermore predicts that the ionic solvation should
decrease if the ion hydration layer (and with that the Born radius aB) decreases, which happens, for instance, when
the polymer is further dehydrated upon heating. Indeed, simulations
at higher temperatures (thereby at lower equilibrium water amount, Kw) show that NaCl partitioning goes down, which
is quantitatively well-captured by the Born solvation model (see the Supporting Information). In the opposite limit
of a very swollen gel at low temperatures, the Born model correctly
predicts that when aB tends to infinity,
and εg tends to εw, then ΔGB vanishes, and K(salt) approaches unity.

Finally, our conclusions for salt partitioning
are based on single-ion
transfer free energies, valid at low enough concentrations. Certainly,
one can expect that, at higher salt concentrations, the ion–ion
interactions could add an essential contribution to their solvation.
We tested the free energy calculations also at finite salt concentrations
and concluded that the single-ion results should be valid up to at
least several 100 mM of bulk salt concentrations (see the Supporting Information).

Molecular Ions
Quite generally, large molecular ions
(e.g., ionized medicinal molecules, some pharmacological molecules)
that possess a considerable electroneutral part can behave very differently
from small monatomic ions.23,31,73 Also, the physics involved in their hydration is expected to be
comparatively more complex. Their geometry and charge density are
not spherically symmetric. Our representative for a molecular ion
is NP–, where the deprotonation of the OH group
for pH > 7.15 creates an ionized oxygen center.74 As we have already seen, the transfer free energy ΔG clearly deviates from the trends of the monatomic ions
(see Figure 6A).

We first take a look at the hydration of the oxygen atoms in NP–: the deprotonated one O– and the
two in the nitro NO2 group, see Figure 7A. For a comparison, the hydration of monatomic
ions (similar as in Figure 4) is shown by gray symbols. It can be seen that O– is not hydrated to that extent as compared to the monovalent ions.
For instance, the probability that the hydrating cluster consists
of more than 5 water molecules (by summing up the probabilities P(Nw) for Nw ≥ 6) is only around 0.8, whereas it approaches
1 in cases of the monatomic ions. On the other hand, the NO2 group is only weakly hydrated (with 0.66 probability of the hydration
shell smaller than 5 water molecules). The incomplete hydration of
NP– can be attributed to a lowered charge density
at the O– site, which exerts a more moderate electric
field on the surrounding water molecules, resulting in a more labile
and shorter-ranged hydration structure. This is because the lone pair
from the oxygen delocalizes via conjugation to the
benzene ring and the nitro group, which in turn makes the NO2 group slightly charged (see the Supporting Information for the distribution of charges).

Figure 7 (A) Ion-hydrating cluster size distribution P(Nw) around the oxygen atoms
in NP– in comparison with monatomic ions (shown
by gray symbols in the
log–linear plot in the inset). The dashed line shows the size
distribution of all water clusters in the gel. (B) Schematic continuum
representation of a large molecular ion that partially sticks out
of the hydrating cluster (partial dehydration).

In a simple mechanistic picture that transpires from the discussion
above, the charged O– and NO2 centers
of NP– manage to occasionally escape the water cluster,
as schematically depicted in Figure 7B. With this in mind, we construct a phenomenological
description for the free energy of a molecular ion (M) as 8  which is composed of the contribution
of the
neutral, nonionized form of the molecule (first term), the modified
cluster contribution (second term), and the Born contribution (last
term). The latter is for simplicity assumed to be the same as for
monatomic ions. In our case, the first term is the transfer energy
of nitrophenol, NP0 (nonionized NP–),
which is ΔGneut(M) = −22(1) kJ/mol as obtained previously.33 As has been shown, the transfer free energy
of a neutral molecule scales to a very good extent with the molecular
surface area, ΔGneut(M) ∝ Am(M).33 The second term is the cluster-potential contribution,
now multiplied by a hydration parameter α,
a phenomenological parameter that accounts for incomplete hydration.
If the entire charged part lies inside the cluster, then α =
1 as for monatomic ions, whereas α < 1 represents situations
where the charge is partially dehydrated and partially evading the
influence of the cluster potential, which decreases the free energy
of a negative charge. The fit of eq 8 to the simulation data point of NP– in Figure 6A gives
α = 0.73. For a comparison we show also the prediction for α
= 1, which yields a too high value.

Moving on to the partitioning,
we show in Figure 6B the partition ratios of the 1:1 salts with
NP– as the anionic component. The nitrophenol salts
partition in the gel much more than monatomic salts do. This can now
be easily understood by using the approximate expressions for a monatomic
cation ΔG(+) and for the molecular
ion ΔG(M) (eqs 3 and 8, respectively)
in eq 5, which results
in the expression 9  where Kneut(M) = exp(−ΔGneut(M)/kBT) is the partition
ratio of the nonionized form of the molecule, and K(salt) = 0.08 is the theoretical prediction for the partitioning
of monatomic salts. Notably, because of an incomplete hydration (α
< 1) of one of the salt components (NP– in our
case), the cluster potential (expressed as Kcl, eq 6) influences
the partitioning explicitly, in contrast to the case of monatomic
ions. The predictions of eq 9 for α = 0.73 and α = 1 are depicted in Figure 6B by orange lines
and demonstrate that the cluster potential has an important contribution
to the partitioning.

Moreover, in many practical scenarios,
larger molecular ions are
not a component of the electrolyte but are instead typically introduced
in trace (submillimolar) amounts into a system containing a simple,
monatomic monovalent salt (e.g., NaCl). Such are typical cases of
charged drugs/pharmaceuticals in a physiological solution or reactants
in catalytic experiments. In the case of a 1:1 salt of a much larger
concentration c0 than the concentration cM of the molecular ions, the expression for
the partitioning of the molecular ions reads (see the Supporting Information) 10  

For our system, we obtain the partitioning of NP– ions in excess of NaCl in the hydrogel K(M) = 4 × 103, which is an enormous value compared to
the partitioning of NaCl salt! A full calculation for the cases with
two anions of arbitrary concentrations shows that the drastic consequence
of the large partitioning of species M is that only relatively small
amounts of it (∼mM) are needed to almost completely exchange
the smaller anion; i.e., the partitioning of the latter decreases
by orders of magnitude (see Figure S5 in
the Supporting Information).

Furthermore, the nonionized form
of the molecule, NP0, partitions with a very similar ratio, Kneut(M) = 3 ×
103.33 This may seem counterintuitive
and against common knowledge, which would anticipate that charged
molecules should be significantly less attracted to weakly hydrated
and hydrophobic gels than their neutral counterparts. In order to
understand this nonapparent and surprising outcome, we use our phenomenological
theoretical framework, which helps us to explain the main qualitative
trends. Inserting the theoretical expressions (eqs 3 and 8) into eq 10 gives us 11  

In other words, the partitioning of a charged molecule in
excess
of salt is proportional to the partitioning of its nonionized form, Kneut(M), which is then modified by the factor Kcl1−αK(salt) due to ionization. In case the
charged molecular centers are fully hydrated (α = 1), the ionization
decreases the partitioning only by the factor of K(salt) ≃ 0.08. On the other hand, if the charged
centers become partially dehydrated (α < 1), this blows up
the partitioning in an exponential manner—in our case with
α = 0.73, this adds a factor of Kcl1−α ≃ 102. One needs to be aware that eq 11 is very rough and cannot yield
reliable quantitative results, but it nevertheless gains important
qualitative insights into the partitioning governed by water clusters
due to incomplete hydration.

Our simulations as well as the
theoretical analysis show that large
ionized molecules can exhibit enormous partitioning (K ∼ 103) in weakly hydrated gels, which was reported
in numerous experiments of charged pharmaceuticals in PNIPAM hydrogels.23,31,73 Notably, the charge does not
necessarily impede the partitioning but can also enhance it.

Conclusion
The understanding of the solvation and structure of charged molecules
within dense polymer systems remains rudimentary owing to a high complexity
of the molecular mechanisms involved. Resorting to a classical atomistic
simulation framework, we investigate partitioning of small monatomic
and larger molecular ions in dense, weakly hydrated neutral polymers.
The simulations reveal that ions are enclosed by hydrating, nanosized
water clusters that accommodate them within a principally hydrophobic
surrounding.

The estimates for partitioning of monatomic salts
between 0.04
and 0.2 from simulations agree well with experiments for a wide range
of polymers of a similar water content. This partitioning is much
larger than inferred from a simple Born solvation model with an effective
homogeneous dielectric constant. The hydration of monatomic cations
and anions is structurally almost indistinguishable. However, the
polarization stemming from the water–cluster interfaces induces
a potential drop of around −0.5 V and renders a substantial
difference in the transfer free energies of ions from water into the
gel: negative for cations and positive for anions. Nevertheless, the
explicit impact of the cluster potential on the thermodynamic partitioning
disappears for monatomic salts because of overall electroneutral sets
of ions that are subjected to this potential. This fact makes the
modified Born solvation model that accounts for a 1 nm thick hydration
shell sufficient.

The story becomes more intricate for larger
molecular ions, in
our study represented by 4-nitrophenolate. Because of its labile hydration
shell, the charged parts of the molecule can occasionally “step
out” of the cluster, thereby escaping the influence of its
electrostatic potential. This has far-reaching consequences on the
thermodynamics. The cluster potential is no longer completely compensated,
and it thus reveals its direct influence on the total partitioning
of the ions, which is by itself an interesting phenomenon. Namely,
the cluster potential is a special type of an interface potential
(the water–air interface potential being the most prominent
example), and as such it may be expected to be thermodynamically inaccessible
and nullified in the overall salt partitioning due to the net charge
in action. However, the fragmented water clusters together with the
asymmetry in hydration strength of ion species involved elude this
paradigm. A direct consequence of the incomplete cancellation of the
cluster potential is a higher ionic partitioning. In fact, ionizing
the molecule may even enhance its solubility in the gel, which opposes
the standard picture of ion solvation. Indeed, high partitioning has
been observed in experiments with charged organic molecules.23,31 Also, the high partitioning of 4-nitrophenolate explains its fast
reduction kinetics in collapsed PNIPAM-based nanoreactors.27

Our study provides important and very
fundamental insights into
the microscopic mechanisms behind the solvation of ions and charged
molecules not only in dense hydrogels but also in other amorphous
matter with water microphases as well. The notion of the surface potential
is extremely vital for various research directions, ranging from desalination
membranes to biomedical applications and pharmacokinetics.

Methods
Model and Force Fields
The atomistic computer model
of the collapsed PNIPAM polymers with sorbed water is adopted from
our previous works.33,34 In this model, 48 atactic PNIPAM
chains built out of 20 monomers are condensed together with 1325 water
molecules (corresponding to the water amount in equilibrium with bulk
water) in a cubic simulation box (of size ∼6 nm) at 340 K and
isotropic pressure of 1 bar.

For PNIPAM polymers, we use the
recently improved OPLS-based model by Palivec et al.(75) with an ad hoc parametrization
of partial charges that reproduces the thermoresponsive properties
better than the standard OPLS-AA force field. For water we use the
SPC/E model.76 We use the force field by
Jorgensen and co-workers48−50 for all monatomic ions, and additionally
by Åqvist51 for Na+ and
Dang52,53 for I–. For the nitrophenolate
ion NP–, we use the OPLS-based force field with
the partial charge parametrization “OPLS/QM1” from ref (35).

Simulations
All
atomistic MD simulations are performed
using the GROMACS simulation package.77,78 Electrostatics
is treated using the particle-mesh-Ewald method79,80 with a 1 nm real-space cutoff. The Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions
are truncated at 1 nm. The simulations are performed with an integration
time step of 2 fs in the constant-pressure (NPT) ensemble with periodic
boundary conditions. Temperature was maintained at 340 K, using the
velocity-rescale thermostat81 with the
time constant of 0.1 ps. The isotropic pressure was maintained at
1 bar using the Berendsen barostat82 with
the time constant of 1 ps.

Free Energy Calculations
The solvation
free energies
of ions are calculated using thermodynamic integration (TI).83 To reduce mutual ion–ion effects (note
that the Bjerrum length is 6 nm), we restricted the number of ions
in the simulation box to three. The net charge is compensated by applying
a uniform neutralizing background charge.

We first insert three
ions of the same type at random positions into an equilibrated polymer
system and equilibrate it further with fully interacting ions for
at least 100 ns. The necessary equilibration time is estimated based
on the crossover time of the ion to reach the normal diffusion.34

During the TI simulations, the Coulombic
and LJ interactions of
the equilibrated ions are gradually switched off. Introducing a coupling
parameter λ ∈ [0, 1] that continuously switches the interactions
in the Hamiltonian U(λ) between the original
interactions (for λ = 1) and a noninteracting ion (for λ
= 0), the solvation free energy is computed as83 12  

The integration is performed in two
stages: We first linearly scale
down the charge, while keeping the LJ interactions intact. In the
second stage, we scale down the LJ interactions using the “soft-core”
LJ potentials as implemented in GROMACS in order to avoid singularity
problems when the interactions are about to vanish (λ →
0).84 The entire TI procedure is composed
of 24 individual simulation windows with equidistant λ values
for the Coulomb part and likewise 24 windows for the LJ part. The
simulation time of each individual λ window is 4 ns where the
first 3 ns is discarded from the sampling to allow an equilibration
of the ion. All the TI calculations are performed with 5–6
independently equilibrated systems for the Coulomb part and 1–2
systems for the LJ part (note that the LJ part converges considerably
faster than the Coulomb part, allowing also a much more accurate evaluation).
The final results are averaged over all three ions in the simulation
box and over all the systems. Even though each ion samples only a
local phase space during a short TI time window, the used procedure
assures adequately sampled values of the free energy.

Because
of the Ewald summation with periodic boundary conditions,
the free energy of solvation depends on the size of the simulation
box, and we have to apply the finite-size correction85 13  where q is the ion charge,
εk the relative permittivity of
medium k [water (w) or gel (g)], and L the size of the simulation box. The correction in our case accounts
for around 0.5 kJ/mol in water and 3.8 kJ/mol in the gel, which is
comparable to the uncertainties of the evaluated free energies. Therefore,
higher-order corrections to eq 13 (e.g., orientational polarization of the solvent due to periodic
images of the ion68) are not necessary.
Finally, the solvation free energies for transferring an ion from
vacuum into the medium are obtained as a difference of the values
obtained from TI (corrected for eq 13) 14  Note that GvacTI may be nonzero for molecules
(NP–) due to intramolecular Coulombic and LJ contributions.

The evaluated free energies represent the intrinsic single-ion
solvation free energies, arising exclusively from the interaction
between the ion and its local solution environment, and take neither
the surface potential ψs68 nor the compression free energy86 into
account. We also verified that performing TI on three ions of the
same kind with a uniform background charge yields the same results
as performing TI on ion pairs (see the Supporting Information).

Need for Free Energy Calculations
In principle, an
alternative simulation setup containing a polymer membrane in water
provides a possibility for a direct evaluation of K from the equilibrated ion concentrations inside and outside the
membrane. The minimal width of both the water and polymer slabs would
need to be at least d = 3 nm in order to overcome
the interface regions of 1 nm (Debye length at 100 mM). An estimated
time for an ion to diffuse from one end of the membrane slab to the
other is d2/Dg, where Dg ∼ 10–4 nm2/ns34 is the diffusion
coefficient in the gel membrane. Furthermore, the statistics is hindered
by the low ion partitioning K, such that the necessary
simulation time for a meaningful sampling would be tsim ≫ d2/(KDg) ∼ 106 ns. This is 3 orders of magnitude
longer than for the free-energy calculations and hence far beyond
the current rational capabilities. The direct method lends itself,
for example, for higher polymer hydrations72 and implicit-solvent models.87

Relative
Permittivity
The static relative permittivities
of bulk water and PNIPAM gel are calculated from the fluctuations
of the total dipole moment M of the system as88 15  where V is the volume of
the simulation box. The fluctuations are evaluated from the systems
without ions.

Electrostatic Potential
In the case
of water droplets
and clusters, we compute the electrostatic potential along the radial
distance from the center of mass (COM) of each target droplet or cluster
as 16  where the summation
runs over all the partial
charges qi of the system,
located at positions ri.
For each radial distance r = |r| from
the COM, we average the results over the entire solid angle around
the droplet or the cluster. In the case of clusters, we also average
the results over all the clusters of a target size Nw in each stored simulation frame.

The potentials
across planar water–vapor and PNIPAM–water interfaces
are calculated from independent simulations that consist of two separated
phases by double integration of the Poisson equation. For a detailed
analysis, see the Supporting Information.
