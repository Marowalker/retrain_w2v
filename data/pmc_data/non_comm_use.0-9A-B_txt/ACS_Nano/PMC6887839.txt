We present here a detailed study
of the wettability of surfaces
nanostructured with amorphous and crystalline nanoparticles (NPs)
derived from the phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). Particular attention was devoted to the effect
of airborne surface hydrocarbons on surface wetting. Our analysis
illustrates that a reversible hydrophilic–hydrophobic wettability
switch is revealed by combined ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatments and exposure to hydrocarbon atmospheres. Indeed, the
as-prepared surfaces exhibited a hydrophilic state after thermal annealing
or UV-O3 treatment which can partially remove hydrocarbon
contaminants, while a hydrophobic state was realized after exposure
to hydrocarbon atmosphere. Using high-angle annular dark-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy for the specially designed GST NP
decorated graphene substrates, a network of hydrocarbon connecting
GST NPs was observed. Our findings indicate that airborne hydrocarbons
can significantly enhance the hydrophobicity of nanostructured surfaces.
Finally, the experiments reveal that previously defined hydrophilic
materials can be used for the design of hydrophobic surfaces even
if the meniscus is highly adhered to a solid surface, which is in
agreement with our qualitative model involving the contribution of
the nanomeniscus formed between the substrate and a decorating NP.

Nowadays relentless efforts
have been devoted to creating different types of roughness in order
to control the wettability of surfaces, including mimicking of natural
structures to generate the well-known “lotus”1−3 and “rose petal”4 effects.
The drive is to meet various demands for technology applications or
realize certain functions such as self-cleaning,5 anti-icing,6 heat exchangers,7 and fog harvesters.8 Processes to form hydrophobic surfaces involve combinations of surface
roughening with the alteration of surface chemistry using low surface
energy materials to mimic for example the structure of the lotus leaf
or butterfly wings that show strong hydrophobicity.

In general,
the surface wettability is characterized by the static
contact angle (SCA) as well as by the dynamic contact angles termed
as advancing and receding contact angles (ACA/RCA) between a testing
water droplet and a surface. The SCA of a testing droplet on a flat
surface can be described by the Young’s equation9 γsv = γsl +
γlvcos θY, where γsv, γsl, and γlv are the surface
energies of solid–air, solid–liquid, and liquid–air,
respectively, and θY represents the SCA of the liquid
on the flat solid surface. When γsv – γsl < 0, one obtains θY > 90° and
the
surface is termed as hydrophobic, while when γsv –
γsl > 0, one obtains θY <
90°
and the surface is termed as hydrophilic. However, for rough surfaces,
Wenzel10 and Cassie–Baxter11 models have been widely used to describe the
effect of roughness on surface wettability. In Wenzel theory (see Figure 1a), the testing droplet
wets the surface cavities leading to increased interaction area with
the liquid droplet. In terms of Wenzel model the apparent SCA θW is given by the expression10 cos
θW = rcos θY, where r is the roughness factor. The latter is given by r = Ar/Ap where Ar is the actual rough
surface area, and Ap is the projected
surface area on the average surface plane. Since r > 1, the absolute value of cos θW is increased,
indicating consistency in wettability so that the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
surfaces would become more hydrophilic/hydrophobic with increasing
surface roughness. However, in several cases, for example, the lotus
effect,1−3 the droplet will not wet fully the surface, leaving
air pockets within surface cavities (see Figure 1b). This case is described as Cassie–Baxter
model, where the apparent SCA θCB is given by the
expression11 cos θCB = fcos θy + (f – 1), where f is the fraction of the solid
surface area wetted by the liquid. This model does not preserve consistency
of wettability as in Wenzel state, since a hydrophobic surface can
be obtained also from a hydrophilic one.

Figure 1 Schematics of the two
models that describe the relationship between
wettability and roughness. (a) Wenzel model, and (b) Cassie–Baxter
model.

Nevertheless, several other studies12−14 have demonstrated complex
cases of surface wettability, where Wenzel and Cassie–Baxter
models could not explain the experimental data. Using the concept
“work of adhesion” that was introduced by Dupré,15 and taking the air–liquid interface on
a solid as a one-dimensional system, Pease12 emphasized that the SCA is the result of an equilibrium position
that the three-phase contact line (TPL) could reach. Then the dynamic
contact angles RCA and ACA were also expressed in terms of the work
of adhesion.14,16 Through experiments on nanofibrous
membranes, Wang17 argued that the 90°
could not be used as the mathematical wetting threshold between the
hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity in designing nanofibrous surfaces.
Derjaguin18,19 discovered the solid surface is prewetted
by a wetting film when in contact with a liquid droplet and described
the film with the concept of the disjoining pressure.

Furthermore,
airborne hydrocarbon contaminants, for example, alkanes,
alkenes, aromatics, and alcohols can be easily adsorbed by various
types of surfaces including gold,20 graphene,21 TiO2,22 boron nitride nanotube decorated surfaces,23 and Ni–Cu–P ternary coating.24 By comparison of the results of wetting measurement and Fourier
transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of surfaces before and after
ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatments, which is an effective
method for removing surface organic contaminants,25 Li et al.21 proved that the wettability variation of graphene was the result
of adsorption/removal of airborne hydrocarbons. They attributed the
effect of airborne hydrocarbons on the graphene wettability to be
the result of reduced surface energy. Although the FTIR results could
provide direct evidence of the adsorption–removal of airborne
hydrocarbon contaminants, the distribution as well as the morphology
of these surface contaminants, which is very important to reveal their
effect on surface wettability, are still unclear. Therefore, more
detailed characterization is necessary to evaluate the specific effect
of airborne hydrocarbons on the enhancement of hydrophobicity of various
surfaces, especially for micro/nanostructured surfaces.

In this
framework, nanoparticles (NPs) provide an ideal decoration
method able to create nanostructured surfaces and achieve certain
wettability, for example, TiO2 NP painting,26 or even more directly, for example, Cu NP deposition
by a high-pressure magnetron sputtering system where the production
and decoration process can be accomplished in one step.27 In addition, NPs derived from the phase-change
material (PCM) Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), which
has been used as an active medium in rewritable optical disks, that
is, CD, DVD, and blu-ray disks,28,29 offer more extensive
possibilities to study wetting on nanostructured surfaces than other
material systems. This is because the surface energy of PCMs can be
altered by the amorphous to crystalline phase transformation without
significant alteration of its composition and morphology, providing
another degree of freedom to tailor the surface wettability.

Therefore, we used here GST NPs both in their amorphous and crystalline
phases as a means of nanostructuring in order to study in depth the
intrinsic relationship of the wettability of nanostructured surfaces
and airborne hydrocarbons. Moreover, graphene, which has found promising
applications in sequencing,30 energy storage,31 filtration,32 and
surface coating,33 offers superior mechanical
properties34 that allowed the designing
of GST NPs/graphene samples to observe the distribution as well as
the morphology of airborne hydrocarbons on nanostructured surfaces
by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM). Hence, the effect of hydrocarbon adsorption on the wettability
of GST NP decorated surfaces was extensively investigated via a wettability switch between hydrophilic–hydrophobic
states due to the removal/adsorption of hydrocarbons by UV-O3 treatments/hydrocarbon exposure. Subsequently, the experimental
results were theoretically explained by introducing the contribution
of the nanoscale meniscus between the substrate and a NP to the wettability
of NP decorated surfaces.

Results and Discussion
Wettability of Flat Substrate
Surfaces Prior to NP Deposition
The evolution of the wettability
of the bare Cu substrate surface
with time is shown in Figure 2a. The bare Cu substrates (for bare Cu surface wetting measurement
as well as GST NPs deposition which will be discussed later) were
made from mechanically polished polycrystalline Cu blocks with purity
of 99.99%. Then the Cu substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with
acetone, ethanol, and water, respectively, where each step of ultrasonic
cleaning lasted at least 30 min. After UV-O3 treatment,
the SCA of the Cu surface is 34 ± 1°, while after further
exposure to air, the SCA rose to 64 ± 1° within 1 day and
finally after 3 days was saturated at 79.5 ± 1.5° without
any significant change for the next 3 weeks (79 ± 1°). Similarly,
the wettability of amorphous and crystalline GST films is shown in Figure 2b. Indeed, both the
amorphous and crystalline GST thin films show superhydrophilicity
(SCA∼0°) after 20 min UV-O3 treatment. Then
the SCA of the two surfaces increased to 48° and 27.5 ±
0.5°, respectively, and stabilized to the values of 48.5 ±
0.5° and 31 ± 1° within a week (Figure 2).

the bare Cu substrate surface. (b) Evolution of SCA on amorphous and
crystalline deposited GST thin films.

For convenience, the SCAs of the surfaces in Figure 2 are redefined as follows: (i) the SCAs of
the freshly UV-O3 treated surface are defined as θU (θCuU,θAmoU, and θCryU for bare Cu, amorphous GST, and crystalline GST film, respectively),
and (ii) the SCAs after long-time exposure in air, where the surfaces
can adsorb hydrocarbons, are defined as θH (θCuH, θAmoH, and θCryH for bare Cu,
amorphous GST, and crystalline GST films, respectively). The wettability
of the involved surfaces from Figure 2 is summarized in Table 1.

Wettability
Variation in Air After Thermal Annealing and UV-O3 Treatments
A GST NP decorated Cu surface was fabricated
using high-pressure magnetron sputtering,35 having high coverage of NPs (ratio of area covered NPs with respect
to the overall area determined by TEM images) of ∼95% as it
is shown in Figure 3a. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, (inset
of Figure 3a) shows
that the GST NPs are in the amorphous state. CA measurements were
conducted afterward, and the results are shown in Figure 3b. The SCA of the as-prepared
sample was 88.5 ± 0.5° and then rose to 135 ± 2°
after storing the sample in air for 7 days. Subsequently, the sample
was annealed at 180 °C for 5 min in a quartz tube with base pressure
in the ultrahigh-vacuum range (∼10–9 mbar)
and then was cooled down to room temperature. The CA measurements
were conducted immediately after the thermal annealing process, and
the low SCA value (42 ± 2°) indicates an annealing-induced
hydrophobic–hydrophilic transition. Then the SCA of the sample
increased to 99 ± 1° after keeping it in air for 4 days,
indicating a hydrophilic–hydrophobic transition. After 20 days,
the SCA slightly increased to ∼101.5 ± 1.5°. The
annealing temperature 180 °C is higher than the crystallization
temperature (Tc) of GST NPs (the Tc of the as-prepared GST NPs was deduced to
be 148 C° to 150 C° in our previous work),35 and the annealing time (5 min) is sufficiently long to
ensure full crystallization of the GST NPs.35 Thermal annealing has been reported to lower the SCA of surfaces
because adsorbed hydrocarbons can be partly removed by this process,21 yielding hydrophobic–hydrophilic transitions.
Nevertheless, the SCA of the sample could not recover back to the
initial hydrophobic (135 ± 2°) state after nearly 1 month
storage in air. We attributed this change in SCA to the changes of
the surface topography as well as the surface energy of the GST NPs
after crystallization by thermal annealing,36 as it will be discussed later on.

GST NPs on a TEM grid. (d) Evolution of the SCA for the as-deposited
crystalline NPs on a Cu substrate after several UV-O3 treatments
and subsequent exposures to air.

Furthermore, we evaluated the wettability of Cu surfaces decorated
with the as-deposited crystalline GST NPs. Indeed, the SAED pattern
(inset of Figure 3c)
shows an identical structure as in our previous studies,35 confirming the crystalline nature of the GST
NPs. The coverage of the GST NPs was ∼96%, which is similar
to that of the amorphous GST NPs sample used for thermal annealing
in Figure 3a. The evolution
of SCA shows similar behavior as the amorphous one, as shown in Figure 3d. The SCA of the
as-prepared sample with crystalline GST NPs was 66 ± 2°
and increased to 105 ± 0.5° after the sample was kept in
air for 7 days. The SCA immediately dropped down to 30° after
20 min of UV-O3 treatment. After 1 day of storage in air,
the SCA of the sample rose to 81.5 ± 1.5°, remained at the
same value for another day, and then increased to 100.5 ± 0.5°
within an additional day. Finally, the SCA was measured to be 101.5
± 1.5° after 2 weeks, showing agreement with the results
of the annealed sample (Figure 3b). For consistency, the as-prepared crystalline GST NPs sample
underwent another 20 min UV-O3 treatment, and the SCA decreased
again to around 30°. Given the fact that the adsorbed hydrocarbons
can be partially removed by thermal annealing or UV-O3 treatment,
it is evident that airborne hydrocarbons play an important role in
the wettability of NP decorated surfaces. Hence, in order to investigate
further the effect of airborne hydrocarbons on the wettability of
NP decorated surfaces, an atmosphere with a higher concentration and
better control of hydrocarbons was created to compare to the effects
triggered by exposure to ambient air.

Wettability Switch in Designed
Hydrocarbon Atmosphere and UV-O3 Treatment
Two
specimens based on Cu surfaces decorated
with amorphous GST NPs, labeled as sample 1 (S1) and sample 2 (S2),
were made using the high-pressure magnetron sputtering system.35 The CA measurements in Figure 4a were conducted for both samples immediately
after the GST NPs deposition. Then the measurements were taken every
24 h (or immediately after each UV-O3 treatment) to check
the temporal evolution of the wettability of the samples. The SCAs
of S1 and S2 were ∼63 ± 4° and ∼59 ±
3°, respectively (marked as “Measurement 1” in Figure 4a). After being kept
in ambient air for 7 days, the SCAs of both samples increased to around
∼120° (marked as “Measurement 2” in Figure 4a). After 20 min
of UV-O3 treatment using a UV-O3 sterilizer
(labeled with NZX Sahne portable), the CA of both samples dramatically
drops to around 25° (marked as “Measurement 3”
in Figure 4a), showing
an obvious hydrophobic–hydrophilic transition. Aiming to extensively
evaluate the effect of hydrocarbons adsorbed by the NP decorated surfaces,
more CA measurements were conducted subsequently on S1 and S2. Indeed,
S1 was kept in ambient air, while S2 was kept in the hydrocarbon atmosphere
(H-A) that was created in a Petri dish by using octane (see Figure S1). After 1 day, the SCA of S1 increased
to 91.5 ± 1.5°, while the SCA of S2 increased to 119 ±
1° (marked as “Measurement 4” in Figure 4a). Both samples experienced
a hydrophilic–hydrophobic transition, and the SCA rose faster
when the samples were exposed to a hydrocarbon atmosphere.

simultaneously with the NPs that decorated the Cu samples. The coverage
of the amorphous was 72%, and the diameter of the NPs was 9.8 ±
0.5 nm.

In order to crosscheck the previous
result and exclude the difference
in SCA concerning the individual difference between S1 and S2, the
storage conditions of the two samples were exchanged after a second
UV-O3 treatment. The SCA of the two samples decreased back
to around ∼25° after the second UV-O3 treatment
(see “Measurement 5” in Figure 4a), which is identical with the “Measurement
3” in Figure 4a. Then the sample S1 and S2 were kept in hydrocarbon atmosphere
and ambient air separately. After 1 day, the hydrophilic–hydrophobic
transition appeared again for both samples, where the SCA of S1 and
S2 rose to 117 ± 1° and 98 ± 2°, respectively
(see “Measurement 6” in Figure 4a). The latter shows consistency with the
results of “Measurement 4” and excluded the individual
difference factor between the two samples. Subsequently, the two samples
were kept in their original conditions for 3 days (i.e., S1 in H-A and S2 in air) where the SCA of S1
saturated to values 120 ± 3°, while the SCA of S2 steadily
climbed to 117 ± 4°. Comparing the storage conditions of
ambient air and H-A, the main difference lies in the concentration
of hydrocarbons, and the results in Figure 4a indicate that higher airborne hydrocarbon
concentration could boost the process of transforming the hydrophilic
to the hydrophobic state for the as-prepared samples after UV-O3-induced removal of adsorbed hydrocarbons. Therefore, it is
reasonable to expect that the hydrocarbons adsorbed by the surfaces
play an important role in the hydrophilic–hydrophobic transition
of GST NP decorated Cu.

Additionally, the wetting state of the
two samples immediately
after UV-O3 treatment is termed as a “hydrophilic
state” with a typical image as in Figure 4b, while the wettability of the samples after
1 day storage in H-A or 4 days storage in ambient air, which show
strong hydrophobicity (SCA > 100°), is termed as a “hydrophobic
state” with a typical image as in Figure 4c. Moreover, the ACA was measured to be 123°
(see Movie 1 in Supporting Information),
while the RCA was measured to be 15° (see Figure 4d). The RCA was indicated directly on the
image instead of using the fitting model based on the ellipse outline.
This is because the sectional view of the outline of the testing droplet
tends to show a triangular shape due to the strong adhesion force
between the surface and the testing droplet. Subsequently, the hysteresis
(θH) of the as-prepared sample, which is defined
as the difference between ACA (θA) and RCA (θR) with θH = θ A –
θR,37 was calculated to
be 108°.

Characterization of Hydrocarbons on GST NP
Decorated Surfaces
In order to understand the effect of hydrocarbons
adsorbed on NP
decorated surfaces, we performed HAADF-STEM imaging measurements to
gain insight on the distribution and morphology of adsorbed hydrocarbons.
Because the contrast in HAADF-STEM is related to the thickness and
the square of average atomic number of the corresponding atomic column,
the thin thickness and low average atomic number of adsorbed hydrocarbons
will yield weak contrast for the adsorbed hydrocarbons that will be
obscured by the substrate material. Therefore, not only the average
atomic number but also the thickness of the substrate should be low
enough to minimize the contrast interference during HAADF-STEM measurements.
Monolayer graphene, having a low atomic number (6 C) and being extremely
thin (1 atomic layer thick), is a perfect candidate satisfying the
stringent criteria of this particular sample design to observe the
adsorption of surface hydrocarbons. Moreover, the superior mechanical
properties (elastic modulus and intrinsic breaking strength) of graphene34 renders this system as a promising candidate
to support decoration with GST NPs by the magnetron sputtering deposition.
Hence, a monolayer (partly bilayer or trilayer) graphene was synthesized
by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and subsequently, the graphene
layer was transferred onto a Quantifoil R2/1 holey carbon (Electron
Microscopy Sciences, Q225-AR1) TEM grid, which served as the substrate
for NPs deposition in the magnetron sputtering system. Finally, the
sample was kept in ambient air for 3 weeks to adsorb sufficient coverage
of hydrocarbons for later TEM observations.

The morphology of GST NPs/graphene sample is shown in Figure 5a. The dark circles
are GST NPs, and there is an obvious difference in the contrast with
the background. The left bottom part of Figure 5a, divided by the red dashed line, refers
to graphene/carbon support, while the top right part, where the contrast
is relatively brighter, is mostly the suspended monolayer graphene
shown in Figure 5b.
The bright areas with spherical like features in Figure 5c (with high contrast) are
the GST NPs, while the dark areas (with low contrast) are supposed
to be the graphene. However, there are also some “conjunctions”
among the NPs showing a “cloudy” contrast (obviously
distinct in between the bright and dark parts), which are presumably
the adsorbed airborne hydrocarbons. Figure 5d is the bright-field (BF) STEM image, which
in line with Figure 5c also shows the outline of the GST NPs. However, the “cloudy”
areas are not visible in Figure 5d, proving that the “cloudy” areas among
the NPs in Figure 5c do not present some “heavy” atoms from the materials
during sample preparation. Therefore, together with Figure 5c, the BF STEM image also implies
that the “cloudy” areas belong to airborne hydrocarbons.
The “cloudy” areas are also shown in Figure 5e, where the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping data in Figure 5f–h show the material contrasts of
the GST NPs. This material outlines overlap with that of the bright
areas in Figure 5e,
showing that the Ge/Sb/Te elements mainly locate at this bright area,
reconfirming that the “cloudy area” is the hydrocarbon
contamination. The results of Figure 5 prove that there are airborne hydrocarbons on the
surface of the as-prepared samples after exposure to ambient conditions.
The width of the adsorbed hydrocarbons assemblies was measured to
be ∼7–20 nm in Figure 5c, in equivalent scale with the size of the deposited
GST NPs. Moreover, the adsorbed hydrocarbons not only cover the GST
NPs but also the intervals of individual NPs on the corresponding
substrates.

Effect on Wettability Due to Airborne Hydrocarbons
Here we will attempt to analyze the wettability of the hydrophobic-state
of samples decorated by GST NPs where the influence of surface hydrocarbons
is the most pronounced. Considering the large hysteresis, which implies
high adhesion force, Wenzel model10 comes
naturally into consideration. At a first glimpse, this model appears
unsuitable for the GST NP decorated surfaces, because it has been
applied to monocomponent systems instead of a surface decorated with
different materials. Considering the substrate and the decorating
NPs are materials that can be completely wetted by the testing droplet,
the Wenzel model can be modified for describing the binary component
system in the form: 1  where θW′ is the
apparent SCA of a binary composite surface in Wenzel state, and θS and θN are the SCAs for the substrate exposed
surfaces and NPs, respectively. Here r (≥1)
is the roughness factor with the same definition as indicated before,
while fS and fN are the ratios of the actual surface area of the exposed substrate
and NP surfaces to the projected surface area on a plane that is parallel
with the substrate, respectively. Therefore, if the surfaces of the
substrate and NPs are both hydrophilic, the binary composite surface
would preserve its hydrophilicity, and vice versa if both materials are hydrophobic the NP decorated surfaces will
be hydrophobic.

The wettability of as-prepared amorphous GST
NP decorated Cu surfaces with sufficient coverage CG (∼72%) was analyzed by the modified model of eq 1. Indeed, from Figure 4a, the SCA of the
freshly UV-O3 treated sample was measured to be θAmo/CuU = 25°,
while the SCAs of the involved materials (in planar form, see Table 1) were measured immediately
after UV-O3 treatment to be θCuU = 34° and θAmoU = 0°. Assuming
that the contacts between GST NPs and the Cu substrate are point-like
contacts, we can set for the contact area of the testing water on
the Cu substrate fS ≈ 1. Because
most of amorphous GST NPs are spherical, the factor fN can be roughly calculated by , where rN is
the radius of the NPs. Substituting these parameters in eq 1, we obtain for the theoretical
SCA for the freshly UV-O3 treated sample cos θAmo/CuUT > 1,
indicating
a superhydrophilic state or θAmo/CuUT = 0°. The difference between the
calculated and experimental SCAs may stem from the two following reasons:
(i) The liquid–solid contact area used in the calculation may
differ from the real one (which will be discussed latter and schematically
shown in Figure 6),
which lead to over estimation of fS and fN, giving a lower theoretical SCA. (ii) It is
more difficult for adsorbed hydrocarbons to be removed by UV-O3 treatment on GST NPs than on flat GST surfaces, because the
NPs form a porous network with higher content of residual hydrocarbons
than the flat GST surface. The latter leads subsequently to stronger
surface hydrophobicity. Nevertheless, the experimental value θAmo/CuU is still
lower than θCuU, indicating that the surface roughness due to the deposited
NPs can make the original substrate more hydrophilic. Therefore, eq 1 can explain qualitatively
the experimental results for the fresh UV-O3 treated surfaces.

angle with eq 1. (b)
More realistic geometry
of the problem: r1 is the negative radius
of curvature, r2 (not shown) is the positive
radius of curvature in the orthogonal direction to the plane, h1 is the thickness of wetting film on the substrate,
and h2 is the thickness of wetting film
on the NPs.

Furthermore, the experimental results from hydrocarbon adsorbed
surfaces were also analyzed in terms of eq 1. Substituting the experimental values θCuH = 79° and
θAmoH =
48.5° as well as fS and fN (with the same values as the previous calculation after
a fresh UV-O3 treatment yielding fS ≈ 1, fN ≈ 4CG) into eq 1, the calculated value of the theoretical SCA for the amorphous
GST NP decorated surface yield again cos θAmo/CuHT > 1, indicating a superhydrophilic
state with cos θAmo/CuHT = 0°. However, this value is much lower
than that of the SCA for the Cu substrate surface (θCuH = 79°),
and it has an obvious difference from the experimental value θAmo/CuH = 120°.
Obviously, the modified model fails to offer even a qualitative explanation
for the wetting state of the amorphous GST NP decorated surface with
hydrocarbons adsorbed. In addition, the as-prepared GST NP decorated
surface was not in the Cassie–Baxter state, at least in the
outer area of the water droplet, because the measured high hysteresis
(θH = 108°) indicates high adhesion force between
the water meniscus and the tested surface. The latter does not occur
for the Cassie–Baxter wetting state. Therefore, besides lowering
the surface energy, the interaction with porous geometry should be
taken carefully into account when evaluating the effect of airborne
hydrocarbons on NP decorated surfaces.

Amorphous and crystalline
GST NP decorated surfaces are found to
have a wettability that can be switched by UV-O3 treatments
and hydrocarbon atmospheres. The microstructure and distribution of
hydrocarbons adsorbed by amorphous GST NPs decorating surfaces were
measured to aid understanding of the effect of airborne hydrocarbons
on the wettability of NP decorated surfaces. The evolution of SCAs
of the flat surfaces, before and after airborne hydrocarbon adsorption
(Table 1), shows that
for Cu they change from 34° to 79°, for amorphous GST from
∼0° to 48.5°, and for crystalline GST from ∼0°
to 31°. These results show agreement with previous studies in
airborne hydrocarbon tunable wettability of flat surfaces where the
SCAs of gold20 and graphene21 rose from 0° and 44° to 60° and
80° after adsorption of airborne hydrocarbons, respectively.
Compared with the wettability evolution of flat surfaces, the SCAs
of GST NPs decorating Cu surfaces display a more significant increase
in SCAs after airborne hydrocarbon adsorption, where the SCA rose
from 25° to 120° (with NP coverage of 72%). However, the
significant increase of SCA of the NP decorated surfaces could not
be explained by the Wenzel model, which is frequently used for describing
the wettability of microstructured surfaces with high wetting hysteresis.
Therefore, more efforts should be paid for analyzing our experimental
results.

Beyond Wenzel Model
Long ago it was realized18,38 that the wetting phenomenon is driven by long-range surface forces.
For a wetting film of thickness h, the disjoining
pressure Π(h) was introduced in 1936 by Derjaguin15,16 (as the difference between the pressures in a region of a phase
adjacent to a surface confining this phase and the pressure in the
bulk of this phase) to describe the effect of surface interactions.
The disjoining pressure is related to the contact angle θ by
the equation18,19 2  where γ = γlv is the surface tension of liquid, and h0 is the precursor film thickness ahead of the liquid
droplet. In equilibrium, the film thickness is determined from the
relation Π(h0) = Pc, where Pc is the capillary
pressure in the bulk liquid. For macroscopic liquid volumes the capillary
pressure  is small, where  is a macroscopic
curvature radius of the
meniscus. In this case, the last term in eq 2 is small  since h0 is
in the nanometer range. For this reason, eq 2 is often presented without the last term.39 Furthermore, the wettability of a material is
defined by the integral . For IΠ > 0, the material is superhydrophilic, for −1 < IΠ < 0, the material is hydrophilic,
for −2 < IΠ < −1,
the material is hydrophobic, and for IΠ < – 2, the material is in a nonwetting state. For the
case of partial wetting, the typical behavior of the disjoining pressure
is shown in Figure S2.

Both materials
of interest (Cu and GST) stay hydrophilic (see the results in Table 1) even after exposure
to hydrocarbons, and according to eq 1 we cannot obtain the observed hydrophobicity for any
parameters of fS and fN. Therefore, it is obvious that some important element
is missing in the previous analysis. First, let us note that NPs have
a small radius of curvature, namely, R ≈ 5
nm, while eq 2 was derived
for flat surfaces. Generalization for the case of curved surfaces
has been analyzed in the work by Boinovich and Emelyanenko.40 Using the general thermodynamic approach, it
was found that for a spherical surface, eq 2 is modified in the form: 3  Here it is assumed that the
surface is convex and described by the radius of curvature R, while for a concave surface one has to change R → −R. A significant effect
of the curvature is possible only for R comparable
with the distance range of the surface forces h ∼
1 nm. The modification due to surface curvature is, however, not sufficient
to explain the observations since the factor (1 + h/R)2 influences rather the repulsive
long-distance tail of the disjoining pressure.

Calculations
with eq 1 have been performed
for the configuration shown schematically in Figure 6a, while the actual
geometry has to look like that shown in Figure 6b. The most important difference is the presence
of a concave meniscus with a nanoscopic radius r1. In the orthogonal direction, the meniscus is convex but
with a significantly larger radius r2 > r1.

Eq 3 does not take
the nanomeniscus into account, but it can be included following the
same line of reasoning as that used in previous work40 to deduce eq 3. The disjoining pressure appears in eq 3 as the difference between the pressure in the film Pf and the pressure Pb in the bulk. If there is no meniscus, this difference is equal to
the disjoining pressure: Pf(h) – Pb = Π(h). The meniscus will contribute to Pf, and in this case one obtains 4  The radii of curvature are
also functions of the film thickness, but the determination of this
dependence is out of the scope of this paper. Our purpose here is
to give a qualitative description of the effect. Nevertheless, it
is important to mention that r2 > r1, while R is, in general,
the largest in length parameter. Both radii become comparable when r1 ∼ R. For h ≪ R one can expect that r1 ∼ h with r1 increasing with h. After substitution, the
contact angle θN is given by 5  For the equilibrium film thickness h = h0, the expression in the
square brackets has to be zero (with precision ). The term that includes the capillary
pressure of the meniscus is negative and not small in comparison with
ΠN. As a result, this term reduces
cos θN, and it is exactly what we need to explain
the transition to the hydrophobic state. Therefore, we can conclude
that the transition to the hydrophobic state can be explained by the
formation of the nanomeniscus, when the nanoparticles on the substrate
are also wetted.

Comparing the results in Figure 3a,b and Figure 3c,d, after the adsorbing airborne hydrocarbons,
the SCA of
the amorphous GST NP decorated Cu is higher than the one of the airborne
hydrocarbons adsorbed on the in situ crystallized
GST NPs. The explanation for this difference may stem from two aspects.
On one hand, the surface energy of amorphous GST flat surface with
adsorbed airborne hydrocarbons (with SCA of 48.5°) is lower than
the surface energy of the crystalline one. Therefore, the SCA when
airborne hydrocarbons adsorbed on amorphous GST NP decorated Cu surfaces
should show higher SCA than the crystalline GST NPs if they share
the same morphology. In addition, the coalescence of NPs is stronger
for the in situ crystallized GST NPs, so the effective
radius of the NPs will be larger, and the SCA would be lower when
a larger “R” is used in eq 5.

Conclusions
In
summary, the effect of airborne hydrocarbons on the wettability
of GST NP decorated surfaces has been extensively studied in a systematic
manner. Besides the effect of lowering the surface energy by airborne
hydrocarbons, the geometry of the three phase contact area of GST
NP decorated surfaces was discussed in order to shed light on the
question: Why some nanostructured surfaces do not follow the Wenzel
model when they show a rose petal type of wettability associated with
strong pinning of water droplets. In this respect, our results provide
a comprehensive understanding of how strong is the effect of airborne
hydrocarbons on the wettability of NP decorated surfaces, indicating
that the hydrocarbon adsorption/removal process can effectively manipulate
the wettability of nanostructured surfaces. Moreover, our results
imply that some previously defined “hydrophilic” materials
could be used in a hydrophobic surface design.

Methods
GST NPs
on Cu Blocks
The GST NPs were deposited in
a modified Mantis Nanogen 50 system on mechanically
polished Cu (purity: 99.99%) blocks (area: 1 cm × 1 cm) having
a native surface oxide layer. A TEM grid with continuous carbon supporting
film was put together with the Cu blocks for subsequent TEM observations.
The size and coverage of the GST NPs are controlled by the settings
in the Mantis Nanogen 50 system. The coverage of
NPs was obtained from TEM images. More details can be seen in our
previous works.41,42

Amorphous GST NPs on Graphene
The 25 μm-thick
copper foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.8% purity) was cleaned by soaking in acetic
acid for 8 h, rinsed by water, and then put into a quartz tube for
graphene growth. The quartz tube was filled with 0.1 mbar hydrogen
(Messer, purity 5.0) to eliminate the residual copper oxide on the
copper surface. Meanwhile, it was heated up to 1035 °C. Afterward,
0.2 mbar mixture of argon and methane (5%) was added into the quartz
tube at 1035 °C for 2 h. Thereafter, the copper foil was cooled
down to room temperature with all the gases remaining. Then the graphene
was transferred onto Quantifoil R2/1 holey carbon (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, Q225-AR1) TEM grids. First, the TEM grids were placed on
top of graphene on copper. Two drops of isopropanol (IPA) were deposited
on the sample to enhance the bonding between graphene and the carbon
membrane of the quantifoil TEM grids after the IPA evaporated. The
sample was then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to finally strengthen
the contact between graphene and the TEM grids before the copper was
etched away in (NH4)2S2O8 0.1 g/mL for 24 h. The TEM grids covered with graphene were eventually
rinsed three times in demi-water to eliminate any remaining trace
of the etchant. Then the graphene covered TEM grids were put as substrate
and received GST NPs deposition, the setting for this deposition process
is the same as the Cu/GST NPs samples. Therefore, GST NPs were distributed
at intervals on graphene and graphene/carbon areas. More details can
be seen in our previous work.43

TEM Observations
The morphology of the as-deposited
NPs was characterized using a JEOL 2010 at 200 kV within 1 h after
sample deposition. The energy dispersive spectroscopy elemental maps
and high-resolution STEM images were recorded using a JEOL (Accel)
ARM 200F (UHR pole piece) equipped with a single 100 mm2 (0.65 srad) EDX detector and FEI Themis Z equipped with SuperX EDX
detectors (four 30 mm2 detectors providing 0.7 srad). High
acceleration voltage (200 kV) was utilized to record overview BF TEM
images of the GST NPs, while low acceleration voltages (40 and 60
kV) were used to record STEM images when graphene is involved since
high voltage (above 80 kV) can easily induce knock-on damage to the
monolayer graphene due to the collision of the beam electrons with
the nucleus of the graphene target atom.

Contact Angle Measurement
The contact angle measurements
were performed using a Dataphysics OCA25 system. An automated syringe
dropped 2 μL droplets of pure water (Milli-Q) on the sample,
where a camera recorded the pictures over a period of several seconds.
The drop shape is analyzed based on the shape of an ideal sessile
drop, the surface curvature of which results only from the force equilibrium
between surface tension and weight. The values of the contact angle
were obtained via a fit using the Young–Laplace
(YL) equation based on the shape analysis of a complete drop and also
compared to the results obtained from the geometrical CA analysis.
For every sample, the CA measurements were repeated for several drops
on different sample areas.

GST Films Fabrication
Amorphous
and crystalline GST
films were deposited on flat silicon with native oxide layer using
pulsed laser deposition (PLD) under room temperature and 200 °C,
separately. A sintered GST225 powder target from KTECH with 99.999%
purity was used, and background pressure was below 10–7 mBar. The target was ablated using a KrF excimer laser (248 nm),
with a fluence of 1.0 J cm–2 and a spot size of
1.3 mm2. The deposition was performed at room temperature,
in 0.12 mbar argon gas with a 1 sccm flow, and a target–substrate
distance of 4 cm. The resulting GST films are flat and homogeneous
(see Figure S3). The thicknesses of both
films are more than 40 nm, which is larger than the cutoff distance
of van der Waals interaction between water and GST surfaces and thick
enough for evaluation of wettability of GST flat surfaces.
