Metal-halide
semiconductors with perovskite crystal structure are attractive due
to their facile solution processability, and have recently been harnessed
very successfully for high-efficiency photovoltaics and bright light
sources. Here, we show that at low temperature single colloidal cesium
lead halide (CsPbX3, where X = Cl/Br) nanocrystals exhibit
stable, narrow-band emission with suppressed blinking and small spectral
diffusion. Photon antibunching demonstrates unambiguously nonclassical
single-photon emission with radiative decay on the order of 250 ps,
representing a significant acceleration compared to other common quantum
emitters. High-resolution spectroscopy provides insight into the complex
nature of the emission process such as the fine structure and charged
exciton dynamics.

==== Body
The outstanding optoelectronic
properties of metal–halide perovskites, in particular hybrid
organic–inorganic lead halides (MAPbX3, where MA
= methylammonium and X = Br, I) have recently fueled enormous interest
in this class of materials.1,2 Inexpensive solar cells
with conversion efficiencies of about 20% have been demonstrated using
hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites.3−5 Astonishingly,
the same material has also excellent emission properties,6 as was evidenced by optically pumped amplified
spontaneous emission7 and lasing.8,9 All these applications are based on thin films that comprise microcrystalline
perovskite structures. However, such ensembles of crystallites do
not show strong quantum correlations between photons, even not on
the level of a single microcrystal.10 Nonclassical
light emission, which has been found in single organic dye molecules,11 semiconductor quantum dots12−14 and color centers
in diamond15,16 and other materials, has enabled
superlocalization microscopy17 and deterministic
single photon sources for secure quantum communication.18 It would be tantalizing to harness the high
oscillator strength, high quantum yield, efficient charge transport,
solution-processability and the simplicity of synthesis of these perovskites
for such applications. Furthermore, being able to access single emitters
circumvents averaging effects within the ensemble of microcrystallites
that can cloak fundamental light absorption and emission processes,
which are of key interest in the improvement of the photovoltaic and
laser devices.

Very recently, fully inorganic nanocrystals (NCs)
of perovskite-type cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = Cl,
Br, I) have been synthesized with precise size- and compositional
control, offering very bright, tunable, narrowband luminescence over
the whole visible wavelength range.19 High
defect tolerance and absence of detrimental mid-gap surface defects,
commonly reported for hybrid organic–inorganic MAPbX3 thin-films,20 are clearly shared also
by their CsPbX3 NCs cousins showing high room-temperature
photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 90% without any additional
surface passivation. This opened up a wealth of opportunities for
tunable light sources based on compositional and quantum-size tuning,19 including recently demonstrated single-photon
emission at room temperature.21 These investigations
clearly highlighted the immediate potential for real-world applications
such as backlighting in television displays and light-emitting diodes.
However, the broad emission line width at room-temperature obscured
many features of the underlying photophysics. Low temperature investigations
could unveil a substantially different picture and provide deep insight
into the fine structure, spectral diffusion and charged emitting states.

Here, we present a micro-photoluminescence study on single colloidal
mixed-halide CsPb(Cl/Br)3 NCs of ca. 9.5
nm diameter (Figure 1a–c, Methods and Supporting Information) at low temperature (T = 6 K). In comparison to ensemble measurements of the same material,
the spectral width of the photoluminescence (PL) is reduced from 25
to 1 meV full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) due to the absence of inhomogeneous
broadening (Figure 1d). The emission peak energy is red-shifted by 95 meV compared to
room temperature, due to the temperature-dependent deformation of
the crystal lattice. Importantly, control experiments with X-ray diffraction
(XRD) confirmed retention of the cubic perovskite crystal structure
upon cooling (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), ruling out transition to tetragonal or orthorhombic
phases as a factor influencing optical properties at low temperatures.
The following results are representative of several samples from different
synthesis batches, and are obtained from the measurements of tens
of individual NCs.

Results
In general, single quantum
emitters are susceptible to their environment, and their emission
can be altered by external electromagnetic fields. Within solid state
systems, nearby trapped charges or polarization of the surrounding
material lead to spectral diffusion of the emission energy. At low
optical excitation power Pex = 1.8 μW,
we observe spectral diffusion with a standard deviation of 0.13 meV,
much below the PL fwhm of 1 meV (Figure 2a). Statistics on the intensity of the emitted
light with binning times of 10 ms show a nearly Poissonian intensity
noise distribution (Figure 2b), reflecting a small non-Poissonian intensity flickering
component and the absence of blinking events associated with dark
states (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). While the magnitude of the spectral diffusion and also the presence
of intensity flickering differ from NC to NC, single perovskite NC
in general show good photostability even without electronic passivation
with a wider-gap shell material22−24 (see Figure S3 and Movie S1 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 2 (a) PL spectral time
series shows spectral diffusion. The inset is a histogram of the peak
energies, which is described well by a Gaussian distribution (black
line). (b) PL intensity as a function of time shows blinking-free
emission. The histogram in the lower plot follows a Poissonian intensity
distribution (black line).

The hallmark feature of quantum light sources is photon antibunching, i.e., that only single photons are emitted because the normalized
second-order correlation function g(2)(τ) drops to zero at τ = 0. We measure the photon correlations
in a Hanbury–Brown–Twiss setup with pulsed excitation.
In the experiment, we find g(2)(0) <
0.5 (Figure 3a) which
unequivocally proves that the NCs are indeed zero-dimensional quantum
dots (QDs) serving as deterministic single photon sources on demand.
This also shows that we are investigating really single QDs since
a cluster of n QDs would yield25g(2)(0) ≥ 1–1/n. The magnitude of the antibunching depends on multiexciton
generation within a single QD in addition to the background signal
(autofluorescence of the substrate/matrix and components of the optical
setup). We included more g(2)(τ)
traces in the Supporting Information (Figure
S5) in order to rule-out other potential systematic effects. The difference
between our values around ∼0.3 at a temperature of 6 K and
the 0.06 observed at room temperature in ref (21) could be due to a change
of the efficiency to create or quench multiexciton states,26e.g., via Auger
recombination (see measurements for higher excitations power below).
We observe that this value even raises at high excitation power (see
Figure S6 in the Supporting Information), probably due to the presence of additional states being involved
in the emission process.

Figure 3 (a) The photon correlation obtained in a Hanbury–Brown–Twiss
configuration shows peaks every 12.5 ns when the laser pulses excite
the QD. Each peak is described by a single-exponential decay on both
sides, representing the PL decay times. Single photon emission is
manifested by the correlation peak at τ = 0 being suppressed
to g(2) = 0.3 below the antibunching threshold
at g(2) = 0.5. The plot shows raw data
without background subtraction or deconvolution. (b) Time-resolved
photon emission as a function of time after the excitation pulse (without
background subtraction). The linear slope in the logarithmic plot
for two different excitation powers (0.8 μW, black and 7.5 μW,
green) shows a power-independent single exponential decay over about
2 decades with a decay time of 250 ps (least-squares fits are red
and blue, respectively).

We measured the PL lifetime as a function of Pex (Figure 3b) and observe a single exponential decay over about 2 orders of
magnitude which is characteristic of an effectively single excitonic
transition. The 1/e decay times slightly vary between
different QDs within in the range of 180–250 ps, which is significantly
faster than for single molecules,11,27 epitaxially
grown III–V13,28 or colloidal II–VI14 semiconductor QDs or nitrogen vacancy color
centers in diamond.29 It is also 1–2
orders of magnitude faster than at room temperature19,21 which could originate from an increased coherence volume of the
exciton, as it is observed in many other systems such as semiconductor
quantum wells30 or CuCl nanocrystals.31 Although a size-dependent study with NCs significantly
smaller than the Bohr radius could help to pin down the origin for
the fast decay, this is currently not feasible for single dot spectroscopy
due to the tendency to crystal phase transitions and decomposition/aggregation
upon isolation and purification with smaller NCs. The decay in the
weak excitation regime below 10 μW is almost independent of
the excitation power, proving the absence of various quenching mechanisms
such as Auger recombination or bimolecular annihilation of excitons.
Subtracting the background from the substrate and the matrix (see Supporting Information Figure S4), we conclude
that only a negligible fraction of luminescence (∼10% of all
detected photons) comes from very long-lived states (>10 ns). Because
the room temperature quantum yield can reach 90%, and the Auger-like
power-dependent quenching is not observed, we attribute the short
decay time to radiative recombination that reflects the high oscillator
strength of the material.

Ideally, for a single quantum emitter
the observed PL line width should be as narrow as the Fourier limit
imposed by the emitter’s decay time. Even for the lowest Pex the QD PL line widths appears to be more
than an order of magnitude away from this limit. However, using high-resolution
spectroscopy, we observe that the peak is asymmetric with a fwhm that
varies from QD to QD between 0.6 and 2 meV, and for a fraction of
the QDs a manifold of transitions is resolvable while photon antibunching
is still observed. An exemplary case is shown in Figure 4a, where three peaks with individual
fwhm down to 0.6 meV are resolvable with an energy spacing of 0.75
meV between them and amplitudes that decay toward higher energy. Polarization-resolved
PL measurements reveal that they have different degrees and axes of
polarization (Figure 4b). The peak widths, the splittings (if resolvable), and the relative
polarization orientations vary from QD to QD, suggesting that this
fine structure is linked to anisotropies or defect complexes in the
individual nanocrystals.32

Figure 4 (a) At low excitation
power Pex and high spectral resolution
with integration times of 10 s and a rotatable polarizer in the detection
path, the PL spectrum reveals a complex fine structure. Three peaks
(labeled 1, 2, 3) can be resolved. (b) The polarization of each of
the three peaks is measured by rotating the linear polarizer. The
polar plot shows the intensities at the respective peak emission energy
as a function of polarizer angle.

Isolated single nanocrystals allow the investigation of photogeneration,
recombination and trapping of charges to a degree that remains inaccessible
within an ensemble of emitters where the inhomogeneous broadening
washes out many features. While our experiments at low excitation
power show a narrow single emission line with only little spectral
diffusion and intermittency, this changes when the excitation power
is increased (Figure 5a). At first, the excitonic emission peak still increases linearly
with Pex, showing no density-induced quenching.
Beyond a certain Pex, a second peak red-shifted
by 16 meV arises which intensity increases nonlinearly with Pexα with an exponent of α
= 1.5 (inset Figure 5c). It also shows hysteretic behavior, i.e., that
it can stay present sometimes for tens of seconds when the excitation
power is lowered again. We attribute this additional emission peak
to charged excitons, as the above behavior is a strong indication
of photogenerated charges which can subsequently remain trapped in
the QD. The amount of red-shift (10–20 meV) and the exponent
(1.3–1.7) vary between different QDs in the given ranges, suggesting
that properties of the individual nanocrystals or surfaces like size,
compositional variation (Br/Cl ratio) and defects play a role.

Figure 5 (a) Comparing
low and high Pex (11 μW, black,
and 92 μW, red) an emission peak from charged excitons appears
at lower energy. (b) PL as a function of Pex shows the gradual emergence of the charged exciton peak together
with a strong increase in spectral diffusion and intermittency. (c)
Spectrally integrated emission intensity as a function of excitation
power shows linear behavior (power-law fit gives an exponent of 0.97
± 0.02) also in the high excitation regime. The inset shows power-law
fits to the spectral ranges of the uncharged (black) and the charged
exciton peaks (red), which yield exponents of 1 ± 0.1 (up to
intermediate excitation power) and 1.5 ± 0.1, respectively. (d)
Time-resolved PL measurement shows a nonexponential decay shortening
for high excitation power (red, 51 μW) as compared to the weak
excitation regime (green, 7.5 μW). Both traces are raw data
that is not corrected for the background.

Furthermore, the spectral diffusion and intermittency of
the uncharged and the charged exciton emission strongly increases
with increasing Pex (Figure 5b and Figure S7b in the Supporting Information). At intermediate Pex for some QDs the charged exciton line can
become 2–3 times narrower than the exciton line, suggesting
that the transition might have reduced electron–phonon coupling
or vanishing fine structure splittings. At higher Pex, the charged exciton feature can split into multiple
peaks that is most likely caused by multiple charges being generated
(see Figure S7a in the Supporting Information). Most striking is the observation that the quantum yield (i.e., integrated PL intensity) of the majority of the QDs
does not drop significantly in the high excitation regime (Figure 5c), while the decay
at the same time is further accelerated and becomes nonexponential
(Figure 5d). This suggests
that, in contrast to room temperature,21 the faster decay is still mainly radiative and rather caused by
the enhanced decay rates of charged or multiexcitons and not nonradiative
Auger quenching.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our experiments
demonstrate that colloidal NCs of metal–halide perovskites
can serve as stable quantum emitters with some outstanding optical
properties and versatile processability, allowing easy integration
and offering a clear pathway for electrical driving.33 It is expected that the ultrafast radiative decay and single
photon operation can enable strong-coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics
experiments in high quality factor microcavities.34 In addition, high-resolution investigations on single NCs
pave the way to a much deeper understanding of the photophysics of
these exceptional materials, which can shed light on open questions
such as the anomalous hysteresis.35 Furthermore,
it can guide material development for optimized charge production
and transport or core–shell/matrix heterostructures33 that are essential for a further leap in the
efficiencies of solar cells1 and light
sources.6

Methods
Synthesis
and Sample Preparation
CsPb(Cl/Br)3 NCs were synthesized
by reacting Cs-oleate with a mixture of PbCl2 and PbBr2 in 1-octadecene at 200 °C, as described previously19 (for details, see the Supporting Information). Isolation and purification procedures were optimized
to yield nearly monodisperse (10%) and aggregate-free colloids. The
colloidal NCs were diluted to nanomolar concentrations within a solution
of polystyrene in toluene. A thin film of 100 nm was then spin-cast
on a high-purity, 3 μm thick SiO2 layer which was
obtained by thermally oxidizing a crystalline Si wafer.

Characterization
All measurements were performed in a home-built micro-PL setup
with the sample mounted inside a liquid helium flow cryostat (Cryovac)
in vacuum. For all photoluminescence measurements, a single-mode fiber-coupled
continuous wave excitation laser at a wavelength of λ = 405
nm (Thorlabs) with linear polarization and short-pass filter (Semrock
FF01-440/SP) was used. Excitation and detection was done through a
long-working distance 100× microscope objective with numerical
aperture of NA = 0.7 (Mitutoyo Plan Apo NIR HR) which was mounted
outside the cryostat. This resulted in a nearly Gaussian excitation
spot with 1/e2-radius of 1.4 μm.
The emission from the sample was long-pass filtered (Semrock BLP01-442R),
dispersed by an 1800 lines/mm grating in a 0.75 m monochromator (Acton
Spectra Pro) and detected by a back-illuminated cooled EMCCD camera
(Princeton Instruments ProEM). For excitation in the photon correlation
and PL lifetime measurements, a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire laser
at λ = 400 nm with 100 fs pulse duration and 80 MHz repetition
rate (Spectra-Physics Tsunami with Millennia pump laser) was coupled
through a single-mode fiber to the setup. The detection was done after
a tunable 80 meV-wide bandpass filter (Semrock TBP01-501/15) with
a time-correlated single photon counting system (PicoQuant PicoHarp
300 with PDM, MPD avalanche photo diodes with nominal time resolution
of 30 ps).
