Highly anisotropic colloidal CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets
(NPLs)
represent an appealing class of colloidal quantum wells with enhanced
light emissivity. Strong quantum confinement imposed by the small
platelet thickness and atomic flatness gives rise to enhanced oscillator
strength, higher exciton binding energy, and narrow emission linewidth.
While discrete thicknesses manifest themselves in discrete bandgap
energies, fine-tuning of the emission energy can be achieved by compositional
modulations. Here we address one of the most debated aspects of perovskite
nanoplatelets: their crystal structure. Starting with the direct imaging
by high-resolution electron microscopy (providing a clue on the pseudocubic
faceting of the NPLs), we focus the study on X-ray total scattering
techniques, based on the Debye scattering equation (DSE) approach,
to obtain better atomistic insight. The nanoplatelets are six-monolayers
thick and exhibit an orthorhombic structure. A thorough structure–morphology
characterization unveils a specific orientation of the axial and equatorial
bromides of the PbBr6 octahedra versus the NPLs thickness;
we found that {010} and {101} planes of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 lattice (Pnma space group) correspond to
the six facets of the NPL, with basal planes being of {101} type.
The NPLs undergo a lattice relaxation in comparison to cuboidal CsPbBr3 NCs; the major deformation is observed in the axial direction,
which suggests a structural origin of the higher compliance along
the b axis. The DSE-based analysis also supports
a CsBr surface termination model, with half Cs sites and a half (or
slightly more) Br sites vacant.

==== Body
Nanocrystals (NCs) of semiconductive
lead halide perovskites (LHPs, APbX3 compounds, where A
= Cs, methylammonium, or formamidinium)1−23 have recently attracted a great deal of attention for their potential
use as classical light sources in light-emitting diodes24−31 and LCD displays and as quantum light sources,32−39 lasing medium,40−43 or absorbers in photodetectors44 and
in photovoltaics.45−50 Thanks to the higher ionicity compared to other traditional semiconductors
(chalcogenides, pnictides), these LHP NCs form faster and at lower
temperatures.

Thus far, most of the research has been devoted
to relatively large,
cuboid-shaped CsPbX3 NCs, exhibiting bright photoluminescence
(PL) with narrow emission bandwidths (<100 meV, 12–42 nm
in blue-to-red), high PL quantum yields (QYs) (up to 90–100%),
and short radiative lifetimes (1–29 ns).2 A possibility for tuning the optical absorption and emission
features of LHPs is offered by resorting to anisotropic NCs, very
much as demonstrated for cadmium chalcogenide nanoplatelets (NPLs).51,52 By judicious adjustment of the synthesis parameters (reaction temperature,
ligand ratio, or mixing long- and short-chain ligands), the morphology
of CsPbBr3 NCs can be adjusted to one-dimensional nanowires53,54 and two-dimensional (2D) NPLs and nanosheets.55−64 In the particular case of NPLs, by exploiting the quantum confinement
effect governed by the NPL thickness, blue-shifted absorption and
emission features are controlled discretely. As observed in other
2D semiconductors, a thickness of just few unit cells in LHP NPLs
gives rise to larger exciton binding energies (120–280 meV
depending on the NPLs thickness65,66 versus 40 meV in 10
nm cuboid NCs)67 and reduced dielectric
screening.63,68 Moreover, the large contact area
between NPLs, which have shown a clear tendency to self-assemble along
the direction parallel to their thickness (as a deck of playing cards),55 makes them particularly interesting for LED
applications.69−71

However, LHP NPLs remain poorly understood
at the atomistic level.
One immediate, highly pressing open question is to determine in which
polymorphs they crystallize. This issue has been extensively investigated
in CsPbX3 NCs leading to the clear assignment of the orthorhombic
crystal structure as the thermodynamic stable polymorph at ambient
conditions.72,73 The orthorhombic structure differs
from the archetypal cubic structure by a small tilting of the PbX6 octahedra, which preserves the 3D corner-shared network of
octahedra while introducing structural differences between axially
and equatorially coordinated halides. While these differences are
of lesser importance for more isotropic cuboid shapes, when NPLs are
considered, owing to the highly anisotropic morphology, knowing how
the orthorhombic structural axes are aligned with respect to the NPL
thickness and basal planes is of paramount significance. Therefore,
determining the correct atomistic structure of these materials, in
terms of the crystal polymorph, structural defectiveness, structure–morphology
relationship and surface termination, is a fundamental step toward
understanding and controlling their optical properties. For example,
the utmost correct atomistic model is needed for accurate computing
of the electronic structure by the DFT methods and for rationalization
of the optical properties.74,75

In the field
of nanotechnology, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), especially in its high-resolution mode (HRTEM), is often employed
to retrieve information on NCs structure, size, and morphology. In
the context of LHP research, electron microscopy suffers from two
major drawbacks. First, it has limited capacity to distinguish perovskite
polymorphs through detection of tilting of PbX6 octahedra,
both for CsPbX3 NCs76−82 and NPLs.55,57,58,63,83 The tiny extent
of the tilting is very difficult to capture with imaging techniques
unless sophisticated aberration-corrected scanning TEM (STEM) coupled
with phase recovering methods on ultrathin nanosheets are adopted.84 Second, LHP NCs are structurally labile, low-melting-point
semiconductors, and hence, their atomic structure might be altered
by the beam of electrons. These drawbacks necessitate the reliance
on forefront X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Structural lability
of LHPs manifests itself, most profoundly, in small nanostructures.
For instance, few-nm-thin NPLs are far less robust compared to cuboid-shaped
NCs.55,85 This poses major difficulties for obtaining
stable, size- and shape-uniform ensembles of LHP NPLs.63,85 Such uniform and stable ensembles are imperative for any ensemble-averaging
technique, be it optical characterization or structural characterization
by XRD methods. We also would like to point that electron microscopy
deposits substantial energy flux and, in the case of structurally
labile NCs, this may lead to alteration or damage to the crystal structure.
It is thus much desired to corroborate the electron microscopy with
less invasive X-ray analysis.

In this study, we thought to shed
light on the atomic structure
of CsPbX3 NPLs and on the diverse structure–morphology
related questions.

As a first step, we report the synthesis
of stable and monodisperse
CsPbBr3 NPLs, six-unit-cells thick (ca. 3.5 nm) and with
PL emission peaked in the sky-blue region (492 nm). High PL QYs (up
to 75%) are retained in deposited films, a prerequisite for efficient
light-emitting devices employing NPLs as the active medium. While
preserving the size and shape of the NPLs, the emission spectra bands
can be tuned from 492 to 398 nm (blue/violet) and 632 nm (red) via
fast anion exchange easily performed at room temperature in air.

As a second step, we applied a powerful X-ray total-scattering
based method for characterizing LHP NPLs in their native colloidal
state. Conventional XRD is rather inadequate when dealing with very
small NCs, characterized by extensive Bragg peaks broadening and the
presence of a large amount of diffuse scattering between and below
them, stemming from intermingled effects, such as reduced coherent
domains, aspherical morphology, structural defects, or surface reconstruction.86,87 Moreover, with conventional XRD methods, LHPs are typically characterized
in the dry state; highly textured samples are obtained by dropping
the NPLs solution on a flat holder, which introduces distorted intensity
ratios of Bragg peaks, making the structural analysis even more challenging.
A pertaining difficulty is also to characterize the NC surfaces. Perovskite
NPLs are potentially “easier” in this regard, owing
to their atomically defined thickness and atomically flat basal planes.
Knowing the alignment of the NPL facets with regard to the crystal
planes of the underlying lattice is an essential first step.

We present an accurate structural, morphological, and compositional
characterization of CsPbBr3 NPLs by using synchrotron X-ray
data and the Debye scattering equation (DSE) approach.88−90 The method fosters a comprehensive characterization of the nanosized
materials and full XRD pattern reconstruction, both in terms of Bragg
peaks and diffuse scattering, which intrinsically arise from the detailed
atomistic model definition of NPLs, developed in the real space. Recently,
the DSE-based approach has been successfully and extensively applied
to a wide range of nanomaterials, including LHP NCs, allowing the
retrieval of unforeseen structural and compositional aspects.73,91−96

We present evidence that six-monolayers-thick (6 ML) CsPbBr3 NPLs (one monolayer being ca. 0.59 nm thick), exhibit orthorhombic
structure and {100} pseudocubic facets, which correspond to two {010}
and four {101} planes of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 lattice
(Pnma space group). The basal facets of the NPL are
of {101} family, whereas two remaining {101} planes and both {010}
planes make for side NPL facets. Such determination of the orientation
of the crystal structure of LHPs with respect to the NPLs thickness
would be impossible without combining the crystal structure and the
morphological descriptors within a unified modeling approach. CsBr-terminated
surfaces are preferentially exposed.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Highly Stable Monodisperse CsPbBr3 NPLs
By modifying the procedure reported by Protesescu et al.,2 the shape was adjusted from the cuboid to more
anisotropic 6 ML CsPbBr3 NPLs (ca. 3.5 nm thick). The factors
favoring NPL formation were lower synthesis temperature and two-fold
higher concentrations of reagents. As described in Figure 1a, the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NPLs is based on the very fast coprecipitation of constituting
ions. PbBr2, along with dried oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine
(OLA) in 1:1 molar ratio, was loaded in a three-neck flask in the
glovebox and transferred to the Schlenk line. Mesitylene solvent was
added to the reaction mixture, and the flask was flushed at room temperature
with N2 three times by quickly switching between vacuum
and N2 flow. The reaction mixture was heated to 115 °C
under N2 atmosphere, and Cs-oleate was swiftly injected
(see the Methods section for the detailed
procedure). Rectangularly shaped CsPbBr3 NPLs (Figure 1b) were formed in
less than 3 s, and the reaction was stopped by cooling the reaction
mixture with a water-ice bath. The bright blue-emitting material was
easily separated by centrifugation and further dispersed in toluene.
Drying of such toluene solution results in self-assembled superstructures
shown in Figure 1c–e.
Similar quality NPLs were obtained when 1-octadecene or Dowtherm@A
were used as solvents, but in these situations, the purification proved
to be more difficult for retaining the integrity of NPLs. As shown
in Figure 1c, CsPbBr3 NPLs expose two distinct and segregated arrangements: “flat”,
that is, side up, when the NPLs are exposing the basal (largest) plane
(with typical edges of 10–14 nm), and side-on, laterally stacked,
with a clearly visible thickness (near 3.5 nm, see Figure 1e). Also, in the latter case,
large islands of equioriented NPL domains, where the 2D ordering extends
over a μm size, can be envisaged.

their uniform thickness. (f) Typical absorbance and PL spectra of
CsPbBr3 NPLs with a characteristic emission at 492 nm and
PL QY of 70–80%.

These NPLs exhibit a bright blue emission under
UV light (Figure 1d),
having sharp
peaks in their optical absorption (482 nm) and PL (492 nm) spectra.
The PL band has a full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of about 18 nm
(Figure 1f). The small
Stokes shift between the absorption and the emission peak maxima (≤10
nm) is consistent with direct exciton recombination. We found that
the NPLs obtained by this method preserve their structural and colloidal
integrity and optical characteristics for at least 24 months. As shown
in Figure S1a,b, the absorbance and PL
spectra of 11 and 21 months aged NPLs, respectively, are identical.
Also, the morphology of the NPLs was preserved in time (see Figure S1c,d). The quantum yields (QYs) of the
NPLs embedded in polymer films were reassessed as well and found to
be around 41% for the 11 months aged and decreased to 28% after 21
months. A certain instability toward the formation of a small amount
of the insulating Cs4PbBr6 phase was also detected,
as documented also by others.83,97 The quantification
of this phase, possessing a crystal structure distinctly different
to that of LHPs, was carefully performed by monitoring both CsPbBr3 colloidal solutions and films upon aging, with conventional
XRD characterization (results are shown in Figure S2): the impurity amount remains very low if the LHPs are stored
as colloidal suspensions (ca. 5% by weight) and slightly increases
after deposition as a film (up to a maximum of 11 weight%, measured
after 15 days and ca. 1 month).

With the same synthesis methodology,
by lowering the injection
temperature (90–110 °C), both the absorption and PL emission
peaks can be blue-shifted (445–485 nm, Figure S3). These deep-blue emissions correspond to thinner
nanoplatelets and, following assignments by others, correspond to
two- to five-monolayers-thick NPLs.55,66 However, we
find that our NPLs of these thicknesses are prohibitively unstable
against conventional isolation and purification methods.

We
hence conclude that their practical utility will be limited
and have focused this study on 6 ML-thick NPLs (3.5 nm, PL peak at
492 nm). We also note that, for fine-tuning the bandgap/PL peak energy,
we resorted to fast Br-to-Cl or Br-to-I anion exchange reactions on
these 492 nm CsPbBr3 NPLs as parent-emitters, which enabled
the coverage of a rather broad spectral range, from 398 to 632 nm
(Table S1 and Figure S4), in analogy to
conventional cuboid CsPbBr3 NCs.99 The size and shape of NPLs, and their propensity to stacking, are
preserved after the anion-exchange process (Figure S5).

The low- and high-angle regions of the XRD patterns
of dried CsPbBr3 NPLs (collected with a laboratory instrument
in transmission
mode and a Cu Kα1 source) are shown in Figure 2a and b, respectively. In Figure 2a, a first diffraction
peak at Q = 0.097 Å–1 is identified
(Q = 4π sin θ/λ). This reflection
corresponds to a d-spacing of 64.90 Å, attributed
to the self-assembled superstructure of the NPLs, imaged in Figure 2c. The other diffraction
peaks observed in the 0.1–1.0 Å–1Q-range are consistent with the dn = 64.90/n Å values (n = 2–7) and represent the higher harmonics of the
large peak falling at 0.097 Å–1. This rich
sequence of diffraction peaks demonstrates the persistency of a long-range
order of the NPLs in a dry powder, their average periodicity being
in line with the sum of 3.5 nm (NPL thickness) and two 1.5 nm thicknesses
of ligand coating, well matching previous reports.55,66 Conventional XRD measurements, shown in Figure 2b, vaguely suggest that the average crystal
symmetry of CsPbBr3 NPLs is consistent with an orthorhombic
structure,98 very much like that of more
conventional cuboid CsPbX3 NCs.72,73 This hypothesis was further corroborated by the detailed analysis
with wide angle X-ray total scattering (WAXTS), discussed in the following
sections.

ligands, with an effective thickness of 1.5 nm (on each side). (b)

On the Cubic Faceting of LHPs at the Nanoscale
APbX3 LHPs are characterized by a 3D-perovskite structure, in which
Pb2+ ions lie at the nodes of a pseudocubic lattice and
are octahedrally coordinated by the halides, whereas the A+ cations (Cs+, FA+ or MA+) occupy
the cubic cavities in the center of the pseudocubic unit cell. CsPbX3 perovskites are known to crystallize in three different polymorphs
that retain the 3D framework of PbX6 octahedra. The transitions
between the archetypal cubic α- (Pm-3m), tetragonal
β- (P4/mbm), and orthorhombic γ-phases
(Pnma) involve the progressive bending of the Pb-X-Pb
angles (seen as mono and biaxial tilting of PbX6 octahedra
with respect to each other). Specifically, these angles are linear
in the cubic structure, bent in the equatorial planes in the tetragonal
polymorph and bent both in the axial and equatorial directions in
the orthorhombic polymorph.

Multiple HRTEM reports ubiquitously
provided direct imaging of interplanar distances of ∼5.8 Å
for CsPbBr3 and 6.2 Å for CsPbI3, in both
cuboidal NCs76−78,100 and NPLs,55,57,58 which well represent both the
cubic cell axial lengths and also Pb–Pb distances in the orthorhombic
structure. Similarly, by analyzing the HRTEM images of the CsPbBr3 NPLs synthesized in this work (Figure 3a), the interplanar distance of ∼5.8
Å is easily detected in the directions of both NPLs thickness
and elongation. Hence, d-spacing from TEM images
cannot be used to directly assess the crystal polymorph of NPLs, as
schematically exemplified in Figures 3b (orthorhombic structure) and c (cubic structure).
The interplanar distances imaged by HRTEM relate the Pb ions of interconnected
PbX6 units, always displaying the pseudocubic framework,
whereas the tilt of octahedra (detectable through the halides, not
shown in Figures 3b,c)
is below the resolution limit of the technique. Before validating
the hypothesis of an orthorhombic structure in NPLs, as much as observed
in cuboidal LHP NCs, the cubic structure was initially explored via
atomistic models of NPLs and DSE simulations. We resorted to high-resolution
WAXTS data, collected in transmission geometry, directly on capillaries
filled with the colloidal solutions of CsPbBr3 NPLs in
toluene (details are provided in the Methods section). The cubic model provided a poor matching of the WAXTS
data, as shown in Figure S6.

work, in which the cubic interplanar distance (d =
5.8 Å) is highlighted; a similar value (not shown here) is observed
normal to it. Schematic representation of three-monolayers thick CsPbBr3 NPLs in the (b) orthorhombic and (c) cubic arrangements,

(d) Geometrical relationship between the archetypal cubic (ak) and orthorhombic (aorth, borth, and corth) unit
cell axes and the pseudocubic and orthorhombic faces.

Worthy of note, the detection of the 5.8 Å
interplanar distance
measured in our prismatic NPLs (Figure 3a) provided an important initial input for the construction
of a precise atomistic model: as much as observed in cuboidally shaped
NCs, LHP NPLs expose {010} and {101} orthorhombic facets (in the Pnma space group), meaning that they retain a pseudocubic
faceting, despite the internal arrangement of PbX6 octahedra
and the highly anisotropic morphology. To further clarify this point,
we show in Figure 3d the relationship between the cubic and orthorhombic Pnma unit cell and the pseudocubic {100} morphology (hereafter labeled
as {100}k) versus orthorhombic faces, as observed both
in NPLs and NCs, and also adopted in the DSE modeling discussed in
the next section. Accordingly, with reference to the orientation of
cell axes in Figure 3d, ak aligns to (aorth – corth), ck to (aorth + corth), and bk is parallel to borth. We also recall the metric relationship between cubic
(ak) and orthorhombic
axes (aorth ≈ corth ≈ √2ak; borth ≈ 2ak), leading to a near equivalence of the lengths of the two
orthorhombic cell axes, which is later applied.

Structure–Morphology Relationship in CsPbBr3 NPLs with Orthorhombic Structure
For triaxial crystal structures,
such as orthorhombic CsPbBr3, the possibility of properly
orienting the three (nonequivalent) crystallographic directions (a, b, c) with respect to the morphological
edges of NPLs (T = thickness, W = width, and L = length, Figure 4a), in particular
to their thickness, is of fundamental importance. Matching two orthogonal
crystallographic and morphological bases can be done in 3! = 6 different
ways, each maintaining one crystallographic axis aligned with the
T direction. However, the near equivalence of a and c axis lengths (see Figure 3d) (8.255 and 8.207 Å, as per the bulk structure),101 together with the similarity of the two longest
morphological edges (10–12 nm) imaged by TEM (W ≈ L,
as depicted in Figure 1) firmly simplifies the task, leading to two meaningful possible
orientations (as shown in Figure 4a), one with T aligned with ak (or ck), the other with T parallel to bk. For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the
cubic crystallographic axes and adopt the notation [100], [010], and
[001] to indicate ak, bk, and ck in the discussion of the two configurations,
hereafter labeled as T[100] and T[010], respectively.
The two configurations are indistinguishable in bulk crystals (due
to their “infinite” size) and even in nanocubes (owing
to their nearly isotropic shape). However, when dealing with highly
anisotropic NPLs, discriminating between them comes within reach.

Figure 4 (a) Structure–morphology
relationship in CsPbBr3 NPLs with orthorhombic structure
resulting in two meaningfully different
orientations of the unit-cell (in the Pnma space
group) versus the NPLs thickness: T[100] configuration
(thickness parallel to [100] or ak axis) and T[010] configuration (thickness parallel
to [010] or bk axis). The disposition of axial (yellow) and equatorial (red) halides
of PbBr6 octahedra versus basal and lateral faces of NPLs
are schematically displayed using a single (basal) or a three-monolayers
(lateral) arrangement of octahedra; Cs atoms are omitted for sake
of clarity. Real NPLs thicknesses consist of six monolayers. Details
on surface termination are given in Figure 5. (b, c) Goodness of fit (GoF) 3D surfaces
of DSE simulations obtained by spanning the CsPbBr3 lattice
parameters using a grid search algorithm, for the T[100] and T[010] configurations, respectively; the surfaces
are 3D projections of 4D maps (GoF vs a, b, c axes) at a selected a-value (corresponding to the minimum GoF in each configuration).

Taking the orthorhombic structure of cuboidal CsPbBr3 NCs in ref (73) as
a reference (determined by WAXTS-DSE analysis), atomistic models of
NPLs (in the Pnma space group) were obtained, for
the two configurations, by stacking layers of PbBr6 octahedra
while preserving the pseudocubic morphology of the exposed facets
(as described in the Methods). DSE simulations
of six-thick layers NPLs (10 × 10 × 3.5 nm3)
and cuboidal NCs of the equivalent volume are compared in Figure S7 to illustrate the major effects of
the NPLs morphology on the diffraction pattern. Bragg peaks are shifted
in position from the “ideal” ones (i.e., those computed
for an isotropic shape) as a consequence of different intensity ratios
and widths of the inequivalent reflections hidden below each diffraction
peak. T[100] and T[010] configurations were
then explored against the experimental WAXTS data; bivariate populations
of fully stoichiometric models of nanoplates up to eight layers in
thickness and with adjustable basal extension were considered. Since
Bragg peak positions strictly depend on the lattice parameters, misinterpretation
due to wrong unit cell axes rather than morphological effects are
possible; thus, we optimized the unit cell parameters through a grid
search algorithm, using the statistical goodness of fit [GoF = (χ2)1/2] indicator to measure the quality of the agreement
between experimental data and DSE simulations. The GoF surfaces are
shown in Figure 4b
and c and were obtained by spanning the a, b, and c axes lengths while fixing the remaining structural
and microstructural parameters to preadjusted reasonable values. In
terms of size, the best model consisted of six-monolayers-thick NPLs,
matching the TEM thickness of 3.5 nm. For the sake of clarity, instead
of providing color-encoded 4D maps, we show in Figure 4b and c two GoF hypersurfaces projected at
a constant a-value, in the proximity of the absolute
minima for the two configurations. From the GoF indicators, we were
able to dismiss the T[010] orientation (Figure 4c, minimum GoF = 1.97), which
gave a significantly worse matching with the experimental data if
compared to the T[100] configuration (Figure 4b, minimum GoF = 1.73). The
DSE simulation of WAXTS data for this best model configuration is
shown in Figure 5a and discussed in greater detail in the
next sections. For the sake of completeness, we mention here that
the atomistic model providing the fit in Figure 5a also includes slip planes, as much as reported
for cuboidal CsPbX3 NCs (details are given in the Methods), further lowering the GoF value to 1.62.73 Notably, the same structure–morphology
relationship has been retrieved on other two independently synthesized
CsPbBr3 samples, as shown in Figure S8; thus, the occurrence of the T[100] structure-morphology
configuration can be considered as an inherent structural feature
of CsPbBr3 NPLs. One of the most relevant structural implications
of this finding refers to the structural diversity of the halides
exposed at the NPLs surface for the two configurations, as highlighted
in Figure 4a: the T[100] configuration exposes only equatorial Br atoms (red)
on the NPLs basal planes, while axial halides (yellow) are exposed
in the T[010] configuration. Additional interesting results
are obtained from the analysis of the lattice parameters, as detailed
hereafter.

in a Cs:Pb:Br = 1.0:1.0:3.3 average molar ratio; (f) PbBr2-terminated model of NPLs, resulting in a Cs:Pb:Br = 0.7:1.0:2.7
average molar ratio.

Anisotropic Lattice Relaxation
The unit cell parameters
of the best T[100] model are a = 8.31 Å; b = 11.88
Å, c = 8.21 Å. The unit cell volume (VNPLs = 810.51 Å3) exhibits
a notable expansion with respect to the powder material (Vpow = 796.7 Å3),101 with (VNPLs – Vpow)/Vpow = 1.74%.
Though weaker, a similar effect is also observed in cuboidal CsPbBr3 NCs investigated through either pair distribution function
(VNCs = 803.13 Å3)72 or WAXTS-DSE analysis (VNCs = 802.74 Å3); with reference to the latter,
(VNCs – Vpow)/Vpow = 0.76%
and (VNPLs – VNCs)/VNCs = 0.97%.
Interestingly, the NPLs lattice expansion is not isotropic; if we
compare the unit cell axes with those of NCs in ref (73) (in the Pnma setting), the relative changes of 0.33%, 0.64%, and −0.01%
along the a, b, and c axes
are obtained, respectively (those versus the powder in ref (101) are 0.67%, 1.03%, and
0.03%). The largest expansion is observed in the b axis;
since the other axis lying in the basal plane (c) is
almost unaffected if compared to that of both cuboid CsPbBr3 NCs (−0.01%) and bulk (0.03%), a morphological explanation
alone does not account for the large expansion. On this side, DFT
calculations on MAPbX3102 have
recently indicated that LHPs exhibit markedly different elastic constants
along the three crystallographic directions, the major differences
occurring in particular between the axial and equatorial Pb-X directions.
Thus, our experimental finding of the largest expansion in the axial
direction of the PbBr6 octahedra (running parallel to the b axis) points to the structural origin of the higher elastic
compliance along b, in line with the theoretical prediction.

On the other hand, a non-negligible contribution to the volume
expansion is also observed along the a-axis (0.33% vs
NCs), which we consider morphologically driven and attribute to the
extreme downsizing along the NPLs thickness. Such directional expansion
is expected for ionic compounds, due to unsaturated coordination spheres
and electrostatic repulsion between ions with the same charges at
the surface.103

As per the unit cell
parameters of the best model in the T[010] configuration,
they are a = 8.42 Å, b = 11.60 Å,
and c = 8.29 Å (VNPLs = 809.70 Å3); the b-axis shows a significant
contraction in comparison to both CsPbBr3 NCs (−1.73%)
and bulk structure (−1.35%).101 Finding
such large contraction along the NPLs thickness further weakens the
T[010] structure–morphology configuration. Therefore,
this model not only provided a poorer match against the experimental
WAXTS data but also led to rather unphysically strained values of
the unit cell parameters.

On the Surface Termination of LHP NPLs Surface
Thus
far, the atomistic nature of LHP NPLs and its relationship to the
optical properties remain subject of intense research.66,74,75,104−108

In this section, we used the best atomistic and morphological
model of NPLs resulting from the previous structure–morphology
analysis (Figure 5a)
to shed light on the nature and composition of the CsPbBr3 NPLs surfaces. Three different surface-terminated models were considered:
(1) NPLs with CsBr-termination, fully stoichiometric (Figure 5d); (2) NPLs with CsBr-termination
and excess of Br (Figure 5e); and (3) NPLs with PbBr2-termination (Figure 5f). Parallel DSE-based
simulations of each of these models are displayed in Figures 5a–c, where also the
corresponding GoFs and stoichiometry are given.

Figures 5d shows
the best CsPbBr3 NPLs model obtained from the previous
analysis, which was achieved by using CsBr-terminated surfaces and
fully stoichiometric composition. Stoichiometric balance of Cs and
Br is achieved by removing half of Br sites and half of Cs sites at
the NPLs surface or, in other words, by assigning site occupancy factor
(s.o.f.) of 0.5 to both ions (at the surface). The GoF value measuring
the match of the DSE simulation with the experimental data is 1.62
(Figure 5a). Further
relaxation of Cs and Br s.o.f.’s suggested additional slight
deficiency of Br ions (sof = 0.3), resulting in nearly stoichiometric
Cs:Pb:Br = 1.0:1.0:2.9) NPLs, but did not provide significant improvement
of the original Gof value (1.61). Therefore, if a small deficiency
of Br is considered, this would only slightly increase Br vacant sites
at the surface. Indeed, a similar finding has been recently retrieved
by Nenon et al.107 from XPS measurements
on CsPbBr3 NCs. Additionally, a bromide-deficient surface
was found to be nondetrimental for the PLQY of LHPs, introducing only
shallow defects levels within the bandgap, while a Pb-rich surface
would determine the formation of deep trap states.107

Starting from the previous CsBr-termination model,
we also explored
the formation of a Br-rich surface (despite the indication of additional
vacancies from the previous relaxation test), which is supported by
recent experimental spectroscopic evidence109 and theoretical calculations on LHP NCs.104 The model is obtained by considering the Br sites at the NPLs surface
as fully occupied (Figure 5e); it resulted in the average Cs:Pb:Br = 1.0:1.0:3.3 stoichiometry
and provided a slight worse agreement with the experimental WAXTS
data (GoF = 1.69, Figure5b). For a sake of completeness, an even worse agreement (GoF = 1.85)
is obtained if also Cs vacancies at the surface are removed (leading
to a Cs:Pb:Br = 1.3:1.0:3.3 stoichiometry).

Finally, we tested
a PbBr2-terminated model, pointing
to an excess of Pb ions at the surface), as shown in Figure 5e. This model is consistent
with a Cs:Pb:Br = 0.7:1.0:2.7 stoichiometry of the NPLs and provided
a poor agreement with the experimental WAXTS data (GoF = 1.84). Accordingly,
the results shown in Figure 5 suggest that our CsPbBr3 NPLs exhibit CsBr surface
termination with half Cs and half (or slightly more) Br sites vacant.

Conclusions
In this work, we have presented the synthesis
of six-monolayers-thick
CsPbBr3 NPLs and their fast anion exchange reactions, which
makes it possible to tune their emission properties in the whole visible
region, from 398 to 632 nm. High ensemble uniformity allows the study
of the atomistic structure of NPLs using reciprocal space X-ray total
scattering methods.

By combining HRTEM information on the pseudocubic
NPLs faceting,
atomistic models of NPLs and the DSE approach of analysis, these NPLs
are 3.5 nm thick (six monolayers of PbBr6 octahedra) and
exhibit a defined orientation of the underlying orthorhombic lattice
with respect to the NPL facets. Specifically, the large basal facets
of the NPLs belong to {101} planes of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 lattice (Pnma space group), whereas the
side facets are of both kinds: {101} and {010}. Future studies shall
concern the question as to why the NPLs form in the first place. All
six NPL facets are atomistically nearly identical, explaining the
common cuboid morphology of CsPbBr3 NCs, not the NPLs.
One possibility had been recently discussed by Norris et al. for another
highly isotropic material–zinc-blende CdSe nanoplatelets exposing
a set of identical {001} planes as both side and basal facets.110 The model showing the NPL-thickness-dependent
kinetic instability was proposed to explain the formation of NPLs
within a certain thickness range.

The lattice parameters show
anisotropic relaxation along the three
(nonequivalent) crystallographic directions, if compared to cuboidal
LHP NCs, suggesting a directional (structurally driven) response of
CsPbBr3 to external (ligand or morphology induced) stress,
leading to a major deformation in the axial direction of PbBr6 octahedra. A plausible atomistic description of LHP NPLs
surface termination was deduced as well, suggesting CsBr-terminated
surfaces with Cs and Br vacancies in nearly stoichiometric proportion.

On a methodological site, this work demonstrates (1) the capability
of the DSE method of unveiling relevant subtle structural features
of LHP NPLs, to the same extent as previously attained for the defectiveness
of cuboidal LHP NCs73 and (2) the great
potential of the concerted use of HRTEM and DSE-based X-ray scattering
techniques, particularly useful for investigating this extremely important
class of materials.

Methods
Materials and Chemicals
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, Aldrich, 99.9%), oleic acid (OA, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%),
1-octadecene (ODE, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%), oleylamine (OLA, Acros Organics,
80–90%), lead bromide (PbBr2, ABCR, 98%), mesitylene
(Aldrich, 97%), diphyl (Dowtherm@A, eutectic mixture of 26.5% diphenyl
+73.5% diphenyl oxide, Aldrich), ethanol (EtOH, Aldrich, ≥
99.8%, GC), hydrochloric acid (HCl, Aldrich, ≥ 37%), hydroiodic
acid (HI, Aldrich, 57%), toluene (Fischer Scientific, HPLC grade),
hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 95%), poly(methyl methacrylate). All
materials were used without any further purification.

Preparation of Cs-Oleate
Cs2CO3 (0.4075 g, Aldrich, 99.9%), OA (1.25 mL, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%), and
ODE (20 mL, Sigma-Aldrich, 90%) were added into a 50 mL 3-neck flask,
dried for 1 h at 120 °C. Since Cs-oleate precipitates out of
ODE at room-temperature, it must be preheated to 100 °C before
injection.

Preparation of Oleylammonium Halides (OAmX)
Ethanol
(100 mL, Aldrich) and OLA (0.038 mol, Acros Organics 80–90%)
were combined in a 250 mL 2-neck flask and vigorously stirred. The
reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath, and HX (0.076 mol,
HCl ≥ 37%, Aldrich; HI 57%, Aldrich) was added. The reaction
mixture was left to react overnight under N2 flow. The
solvent was then evaporated under vacuum, and the obtained product
was purified by rinsing multiple times with diethyl ether. The product
was left under vacuum overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 °C resulting
in a white powder.

Synthesis of CsPbX3 NPLs
For this, 138 mg
of PbBr2, 1 mL of dried OA, and 1 mL of dried OAm were
loaded into a 25 mL 3-neck flask in the glovebox. Mesitylene (5 mL)
was added to the reaction mixture, and the flask was connected to
the Schlenk line. The entire system was flushed three times at room
temperature by quickly changing from vacuum to N2 and left
on N2. The reaction mixture was heated up to 115 °C,
and Cs-oleate (0.8 mL of a stock solution prepared as described above)
was swiftly injected. In the next second from the injection, the flask
was immersed in a ice-water bath to stop the reaction. After the reaction,
1 mL of crude solution was centrifuged for 3 min at 5000 rpm. The
resulted precipitate was dispersed in 1 mL toluene, centrifuged again
for 10 min at a maximum speed of centrifuge (13400 rpm), and, after
this, the supernatant was filtrated and used further for different
experiments. The typical concentration of the 492 nm emissive NPLs
was about 8–10 mg/mL.

Anion-Exchange Reactions
The anion exchange reactions
were conducted in air at room temperature. Then 0.2 mL of CsPbBr3
NPLs in toluene (5 mg/mL) was added in a vial, and different volumes
of a solution of OAmX (X = Cl, I) 1.5 mM in toluene were added to
obtain different mixed halide compositions with PL emission at different
wavelengths. The anion exchange reactions are summarized in Table S1.

Characterization of CsPbX3 NPLs
Absorbance
UV–vis absorption spectra were collected
using a Jasco V670 spectrometer in transmission mode.

Photoluminescence (PL)
PL emission spectra from solutions
and films were recorded by using Fluorolog iHR 320 Horiba Jobin Yvon
spectrofluorimeter equipped with a PMT detector.

PL Quantum Yields (QYs) in Films
The absolute value
of the PL QY was measured at room temperature on a Quantaurus QY (C11347–11,
Hamamatsu) equipped with an integrating sphere.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM images were
recorded using a Philips CM 12 and Hitachi HT7700 EXALENS microscope
operated at 100 kV (for low-resolution TEM) and a JEOL JEM-2200FS
microscope operated at 200 kV (for high-resolution TEM).

Laboratory X-ray Diffraction Measurements
Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a STOE STADI P powder
diffractometer, operating in transmission mode. A Ge(111) monochromator,
Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) and Dectris MYTHEN
1K silicon strip detector were used.

Synchrotron Wide Angle Total Scattering Experiments (WAXTS)
WAXTS measurements on CsPbBr3 NPLs (three CsPbBr3 samples) were performed at the X04SA-MS beamline111 of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute,
Villigen, CH) on colloidal suspensions in toluene loaded in 0.8 mm-diameter
certified glass capillaries (Hilgenberg GmbH G50). The operational
beam energies were set at 22 keV (λ = 0.565483 and 0.565666
Å) and precisely determined using a-Si powder standard (NIST
640d, a0 = 0.543123(8) Å nm at 22.5
°C). Total scattering data from the samples were collected in
the 0.02–19 Å–1Q-range
using a single-photon counting silicon microstrip detector (MYTHEN
II),112 together with the X-ray pattern
of the empty glass capillary and the sample environment (He/air),
subtracted from the pattern of the samples. The transmitted beam intensities
from the filled capillaries were independently measured to estimate
the samples absorption coefficients, while the computed X-ray attenuation
factors from the nominal glass composition were used for the empty
capillary. Angular dependent intensities corrections to the raw data
were applied, using an X-ray tracing approach.113 The inelastic Compton scattering signal was added as an
additional model component during the data analysis. For the DSE-model
refinements, the 0.6–16 Å–1Q-range was used.

DSE Method
The DSE provides the average differential
cross-section of a randomly oriented powder from the distribution
of interatomic distances between atomic pairs, within the sample:88,114where Q = 2πq, q = 2 sin θ/λ is the magnitude of the scattering vector,
λ is the radiation wavelength, fi is the X-ray atomic form factor of an element i, dij is the
interatomic distance between atoms i and j, N is the total number of atoms, and T and o are the thermal atomic displacement
parameter and the site occupancy factor associated with each atomic
species, respectively.

Using locally developed routines, bivariate
populations of atomistic models of NCs with two independent growth
directions were generated; for each structural model, the first growth
direction was chosen parallel to the NPLs basal plane and the second
along an axis normal to it, describing the NPLs basal plane and thickness,
respectively.

Each NC within the population is built by generating
a framework
of lattice nodes enclosed within a geometrical surface and by convoluting
each node with the Patterson vectors within the chosen building block.
To obtain the pseudocubic morphology described in the main text, a B-centered supercell based on the aB = aP+cP, bB = bP, cB = −aP + cP transformation
of the primitive (P) original setting, was used.
This provides four faces of the {101} type and two {010}, in the Pnma setting. Needless to say, the different T[100] and T[010] models require indices and axes permutations.

Each population built in this way includes all possible combinations
of bases (or their equivalent diameters) and heights; the step between
two consecutive clusters, along the first growth direction (NPLs basal
plane), is the diameter of the circle of area equivalent to the unit
cell-base; one monolayer of PbBr6 octahedra (i.e., half
of the orthorhombic unit cell parameter) was chosen as step along
the thickness, and an appropriate model construction (alternating
two different types of building blocks, made of one PbBr6 monolayer each) was used. All six facets of CsPbBr3 NPLs were completely
terminated with CsBr moieties, and, afterward, 50% of both Br– and Cs+ surface ions have been randomly
removed to ensure the charge neutrality (average model stoichiometry:
Cs:Pb:Br = 1.00:1.00:3.00).

The interatomic distances of these
clusters are then computed,
sampled (according to a Gaussian sampling strategy, to reduce the
computational times),115 and used to compute
the model DSE, using the Debussy Program Suite.88

First, a grid search algorithm has been employed
to optimize the
lattice parameters of the two NPLs morphologies (T[100] and T[010]) and to find the best model, matching the
experimental CsPbBr3 WAXTS data.

Once the minimum
of each model has been selected, the Simplex algorithm116 was used to optimize the initial microstructural
model parameters against the experimental data. Information from HRTEM
and PL emission was used to constrain the mean value of the log-normal
size distributions along the two growth directions, which are rather
unstable parameters in the presence of highly defective materials,
as in this case. To improve the quality of the fits and to cope with
the HRTEM and PL experimental thickness, slip planes were added to
the orthorhombic models of NPLs, according to the rule: 1/4 < 011>{011}
(in the T[100] setting). Further details can be found in
ref (73). The DSE results
suggested a final percentage of defects in the CsPbBr3 populations
of NPLs of 30%. The best fits and optimized size distributions for
the minima of the T[100] and T[010] models are
shown in Figure S9 and S10, respectively.

Starting from the refined parameters obtained for the T[100] model, three other models with the same structure–morphology
orientation, but different surfaces termination were tested: a CsBr-rich
model (average molar ratio Cs:Pb:Br = 1.3:1.0:3.3), a Br-rich model
(average molar ratio Cs:Pb:Br = 1.0:1.0:3.3, best fit and model shown
in Figure 5b,e) and
a PbBr2–terminated one (average molar ratio Cs:Pb:Br = 0.7:1.0:2.7,
best fit and model shown in Figure 5c,f). These three models, however, performed poorly
against the experimental WAXS data, as detailed in the pertinent paragraph
of the main text.
