We report the construction
of erythrocyte membrane-cloaked Janus
polymeric motors (EM-JPMs) which are propelled by near-infrared (NIR)
laser irradiation and are successfully applied in thrombus ablation.
Chitosan (a natural polysaccharide with positive charge, CHI) and
heparin (glycosaminoglycan with negative charge, Hep) were selected
as wall materials to construct biodegradable and biocompatible capsules
through the layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. By partially coating
the capsule with a gold (Au) layer through sputter coating, a NIR-responsive
Janus structure was obtained. Due to the asymmetric distribution of
Au, a local thermal gradient was generated upon NIR irradiation, resulting
in the movement of the JPMs through the self-thermophoresis effect.
The reversible “on/off” motion of the JPMs and their
motile behavior were easily tuned by the incident NIR laser intensity.
After biointerfacing the Janus capsules with an erythrocyte membrane,
the EM-JPMs displayed red blood cell related properties, which enabled
them to move efficiently in relevant biological environments (cell
culture, serum, and blood). Furthermore, this therapeutic platform
exhibited excellent performance in ablation of thrombus through photothermal
therapy. As man-made micromotors, these biohybrid EM-JPMs hold great
promise of navigating in vivo for active delivery
while overcoming the drawbacks of existing synthetic therapeutic platforms.
We expect that this biohybrid motor has considerable potential to
be widely used in the biomedical field.

Man-made
micro/nanomotors with
autonomous movement have recently drawn much attention.1−3 Over the past decade, impressive progress in designing powerful
micro/nanomachines based on various propulsion mechanisms has led
to advances in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery,4−6 precision surgery,7 cell sensing,8,9 diagnostics, and therapy.10,11 Although current powerful
motors have been well designed, proper attention needs to be paid
to overcome a number of main challenges for performing complex tasks
in a physiologically relevant environment. Most motors are propelled
by kinetic energy derived from chemical reactions, which often requires
the usage of less compatible substrates such as hydrogen peroxide
and hydrazine, with limited control over the directionality of movement.12 Light, magnetic field, ultrasound, and electrically
driven motors are well-designed recently to overcome this obstacle.13−15 Furthermore, the majority of nano- and micromotors still rely on
synthetic materials, although micro/nanomotors themselves can be constructed
out of naturally occurring building blocks. As a result, undesired
immunogenicity and biofouling still present a tough challenge for
these artificial motors, which hampers their performance in a clinical
setting. Consequently, from a clinical point of view, it is necessary
to explore the next generation of fuel-free self-propelled motors
that have a clear biosafety profile as well as precisely controlled
motion. Natural polysaccharides are an ideal candidate material for
the construction of such drug delivery systems with improved behavior
in a physiological environment. These polymers are nontoxic, biocompatible,
and biodegradable.16 In addition, some
of them, such as heparin, have therapeutic activity and can be used
not only as building blocks but also as treatment modality. As the
active component is an integral part of the particle structure, side
effects induced by drug leaking will be effectively avoided.

In order to minimize undesired interactions with the immune system
even further, particles can be decorated with a cell-derived coating.
As the most abundant cells in blood, erythrocytes with their physical
and chemical properties are intrinsically biocompatible, biodegradable,
and nonimmunogenic materials.17 Due to
the protein makeup on their surface, erythrocytes display a long-circulation
behavior within a physiological environment.18 However, conventional chemical or biological approaches would be
impractical for mimicking the complex membrane structure and physiological
properties. A recent, highly promising approach to confer biomimetic
surface properties onto nanoparticles is to decorate them with the
isolated membrane of erythrocytes, or red blood cells (RBCs).19−22 By introducing a cell membrane coating, synthetic materials have
shown capability for accomplishing comprehensive biological applications
ranging from drug delivery, toxin absorption, and immune evasion.23 Hence, for synthetic motors, direct cloaking
with a cell-derived membrane is a convenient way to install the desired
behavior in a biological environment onto the particles.24−27 Considerable progress has been made on designing biomimetic inorganic
particle-based motors, like RBC membrane-coated gold nanowire motors,
Mg Janus motors, and platelet-membrane-cloaked magnetic helical nanomotors,28−30 whereas there are still no reports about combining this cell membrane
coating strategy with polymer-based micro/nanomotors.

In this
report, we describe the successful preparation of Janus-type
polymeric micromotors (JPMs) composed of heparin (Hep) and chitosan
(CHI), which are decorated with a stealth layer originating from an
erythrocyte membrane. Due to the opposite surface charges, the two
natural polymers can be assembled into capsules via a layer-by-layer (LbL) procedure. Here, Hep not only is a structural
component of the capsule but also has biological function, in the
sense that it can be used to prevent or dissolve blood clotting, or
thrombosis. To ensure fuel-less propulsion, the LbL capsules are partially
covered with a gold shell in order to employ near-infrared (NIR) irradiation
to achieve motion via the photothermal effect. Again,
NIR irradiation has a double function, as it will not only be used
for motion but can also be used for photothermal ablation of thrombus.
The sensitivity to NIR irradiation is therefore explored to induce
motor function in a biological environment such as blood and in a
thrombus disease model to evaluate the efficacy of photothermal therapy.
The in vitro experiments demonstrate that the combined
properties of these JPMs provide a safe and efficient platform for
thrombolytic therapy.

Results and Discussion
Janus-type
polyelectrolyte microcapsules composed of polysaccharides
were prepared in three steps (Figure 1A). First, the LbL self-assembly technique allowed
the construction of polymeric particles. Briefly, template silica
particles (diameter 5 μm) were alternately exposed to CHI and
Hep solutions under continuous shaking, leading to LbL assembly. After
assembly of five double layers, the corresponding polymeric particles
were washed three times to remove the unassembled polymers. During
this process, surface charge reversal of the polymeric particles was
monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS). As shown in Figure S1, Hep and CHI were successfully assembled
on the surface of the templates.

tag to prove that the Janus structure was obtained after coating with

Second, in order to form the Janus structure, polymeric particles
were deposited as a monolayer on the surface of a silicon wafer (Figure S2), and then a gold shell was introduced
selectively on part of the particles via a sputter-coating
approach (Figure 1B).
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping analysis
for gold and oxygen (Figure 1C) confirmed the Janus morphology. Third, to form JPMs with
a hollow structure, the templates were then removed, as shown in Figure 1D. The resulting
Au-functionalized Janus structure was characterized by confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM), as presented in Figure 1E. Here, polymeric capsules were labeled
by rhodamine B. After we coated half of the capsule with a shell of
gold, half of the red fluorescence of the capsule had disappeared
(Figure 1F).

Erythrocytes, as natural long-circulating delivery vehicles, are
intrinsically biocompatible, biodegradable, and nonimmunogenic.31 Due to their surface makeup (a myriad of proteins,
glycans, and acidic sialyl moieties), erythrocytes achieve long-term
circulation in a physiological environment.32 By cloaking the JPMs with the isolated erythrocyte membrane, we
expected that we could also introduce similar physicochemical characteristics
and biological functions of erythrocytes that would otherwise be difficult
to mimic. First, erythrocyte membrane vesicles were derived from natural
erythrocytes (Figure S3). The as-prepared
vesicles were then coated on the surface of JPMs by a vesicle fusion
method,33,34 as shown in Figure 2A. Because the entire membrane was translocated,
all biologically relevant surface moieties and membrane-bound proteins
were also transferred to the surface of the JPMs. The successful transfer
was demonstrated via a cell membrane targeting fluorescent
dye (Wheat germ agglutinin, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate), which could
also stain the erythrocyte membrane-coated JPMs (EM-JPMs, Figure 2B). Furthermore,
ζ-potential measurements by DLS also proved the successful coating
with the cell membrane (Figure 2C), as the surface charge of the JPMs was changed from positive
to negative and to a value comparable to one measured for the cell
membrane vesicles. Next, a protein bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
was used to quantify the protein content before and after membrane
coating. As presented in Figure 2D, bare JPMs showed the absence of detectable protein.
A significant increase in protein content was observed after the membrane
fusion treatment. Meanwhile, SDS-PAGE was conducted to separate the
associated cell membrane proteins of the EM-JPMs. Bare capsules and
membrane vesicles as control groups were also analyzed (Figure S3C). EM-JPMs showed the typical bands
that are similar to the membrane vesicles, confirming the presence
of the corresponding membrane.

NIR laser-powered motors have been recognized for
their great potential
in biomedical applications. Recently, a carbonaceous nanobottle motor
based on NIR-driven jet propulsion was designed, which relied on the
photothermal effect of the carbon shell.35 Gold hybrid polymers have a similar photothermal effect, which makes
them also suitable to be used as man-made motors. It has been demonstrated
that laser-induced localized heating could be obtained by integrating
plasmonic gold materials into LbL-assembled polymers.36−39 In the case of our JPMs, irradiation with a NIR laser led to the
formation of a temperature gradient around the particles due to the
asymmetric Au coating. As a result, the JPMs experienced a force moving
toward the nonheated side. Consequently, they were able to display
directed motion via the thermophoretic effect.40 The UV–vis–NIR spectra of the
EM-JPMs in Figure S4A revealed that the
maximum absorption peak of this structure was located in the NIR window,
which is the key condition for obtaining the optimal photothermal
conversion effect.41 Thus, two-photon confocal
laser scanning microscopy (TP-CLSM) employing a NIR laser source with
wavelength of 760 nm was used to induce and record the movement. The
extent of movement was facilely tuned by the incident laser intensity,
as shown in Figure 3A. The velocity of the EM-JPMs was linear to the NIR laser fluence.
Additionally, the mean square displacement (MSD) versus Δt and the diffusion coefficient (D) (D = MSD/(i ×
Δt), where i is the dimensional
index and Δt is the time interval) were calculated
from the recorded video (Figure 3B,C).42−44 Furthermore, the tracking trajectory of the JPMs
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution as a function of laser
fluence was captured by ImageJ software and is plotted in Figure 3D and Figure S4B. Obviously, EM-JPMs display typical
Brownian motion without illumination with the NIR laser (Video S1). In sharp contrast, with increasing
NIR laser fluence, the EM-JPM trajectories were clearly extended (Video S2). The above-mentioned data, including
velocity, MSD calculations, diffusion coefficients, and trajectories,
confirmed that the movement of EM-JPMs can be easily tuned by the
incident NIR laser power. In addition, 10 “off/on” cyclic
tests of the movement were conducted to prove that this movement is
repeatable and recyclable. As shown in Figure 3E,F, taken from Video S3, once the NIR laser was switched off, the EM-JPMs completely
stopped their motion, whereas the motion was restarted immediately
after the NIR laser source was switched on.

EM-JPMs. (A) Velocity of EM-JPMs as a function

time “on–off” velocity control by irradiation

One of the main limitations of application of man-made motors
in
a biological environment is the reversible/irreversible adsorption
of proteins and other biomolecules on the surface of motors, which
can strongly affect the motion capability. The coating of the JPMs
with the erythrocyte membrane should introduce antibiofouling properties
and leave motion unaffected.28,29,45 Hence, the propulsion performance and antibiofouling of EM-JPMs
in several biological fluids (PBS, cell culture medium, serum, and
blood) were tested. In PBS, coated and bare JPMs displayed similar
velocities and diffusion coefficients which had a linear relationship
with the incident laser fluence. In the other three environments tested
(cell culture medium, serum and blood), this linear dependence could
still be observed for both particles, but EM-JPMs under the same conditions
moved significantly faster than the uncoated JPMs (Figure 4). Furthermore, relative velocities
and relative diffusion coefficients were also calculated to compare
the differences between bare JPMs and EM-JPMs, as shown in Figure S5. The maximum speed for the EM-JPMs
reached 19.8 μm/s (PBS), 12.10 μm/s (medium), 3.52 μm/s
(serum), and 2.33 μm/s (blood), which corresponds to relative
speeds of nearly 3.96, 2.42, 0.7, and 0.47 body lengths/s, respectively.
Obviously, all particles move slower when in contact with a more viscous
environment. However, after modification with the cell membrane, EM-JPMs
moved faster and longer in the biological environments than the bare
ones. In order to directly correlate this behavior to the antibiofouling
effect, bare JPMs and membrane-modified JPMs were cultured in PBS
solution, cell culture medium, serum, and blood at 37 °C for
1 and 6 h. Then the morphology of the particles was characterized
immediately with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For better observation,
templates were not removed. As shown in Figure S6, both the bare JPMs and EM-JPMs still maintained their Janus
structure in PBS solution. However, the bare JPMs were aggregated
together in cell culture medium, serum, and whole blood and showed
a roughened surface (Figure S7). With the
protection of the erythrocyte membrane, EM-JPMs were barely affected,
which could be the reason that the movement of EM-JPMs in biological
fluids was enhanced.

culture medium, serum, and blood). (A) Velocities and diffusion coefficients
of JPMs before erythrocyte membrane camouflaging. (B) Velocities and
diffusion coefficients of EM-JPMs.

In order to be suitable for biomedical applications, the
materials
applied have to be biocompatible and biodegradable. Consequently,
to ascertain the biocompatibility of EM-JPMs, a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of mice
embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3), which were precultured with
samples for 24 h. As shown in Figure S8, EM-JPMs exhibit excellent biocompatibility. Furthermore, the biodegradation
of JPMs in the presence of PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C as a function
of time (1, 3, 6, and 24 h) was also evaluated. We performed SEM to
observe the morphological changes for these specific time periods,
as shown in Figure S9. Due to the usage
of the natural polysaccharide (CHI) and glycosaminoglycan (Hep) as
wall materials, JPMs exhibited good performance in biodegradability.
Furthermore, weakened interactions between the LbL layers due to the
charge shielding induced by PBS and the effect of osmotic pressure
might result in the breakage of the capsules.46−48

To assess
the efficacy of thrombolysis of EM-JPMs (Figure 5A), human fibrinogen was used
as raw material to construct a thrombus model by application of thrombin.
The process of fibrin polymerization was monitored by using a turbidity
assay which measured the absorbance (340 nm) at 37 °C for 70
min. The obtained column diagram, as shown in Figure 5B, reflected the assembly kinetics for thrombus
formation, which reached its plateau around 60 min. Consequently,
the thrombus model used to assess thrombolysis was incubated for 60
min and characterized by SEM (Figure 5C). In order to visualize the efficacy of fibrinolysis,
a fluorescent thrombus was generated by adding Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
human fibrinogen to the above-mentioned fibrinogen solution. The resulting
fluorescent thrombus was analyzed immediately by CLSM. As shown in Figure 5D, a green fluorescent
signal proved that a fluorescently labeled thrombus model was successfully
established. To evaluate the efficacy of EM-JPMs for photothermal
ablation of thrombus, the thrombus model was constructed by polymerizing
fibrinogen on a μ-Slide 8 well in the presence of 50 μL
of EM-JPMs (∼4.9 × 105 per μL), followed
by irradiation with a 760 nm NIR laser for 10 min (2.43 J/cm2). The whole process during thrombolytic therapy in situ was analyzed by CLSM. Time-lapsed CLSM images were recorded and
are shown in Figure 5E. Here, the green fluorescence images represent the thrombus model
(polymerized fibrinogen), and the red fluorescent signal originated
from EM-JPMs. The results displayed destruction of the fibrin network
with NIR laser irradiation as the fluorescence of thrombus was gradually
released and spread to neighboring areas. The corresponding video
can be found in the Supporting Information (Video S4), which shows the clot dissolution in real time. To demonstrate
the combined function of motion and photothermal ablation,49,50 a fibrin clot was prepared by detaching the fibrin network and redispersing
the thrombus in solution. Interestingly, by irradiation with the NIR
laser, EM-JPMs with red fluorescence were aggregated around the floating
fibrin clot and then achieved efficient thrombolysis (Figure 5F and Video S5). In order to show that heparin was made available upon
NIR-mediated heating, CLSM and SEM images of Janus capsules before
and after NIR irradiation were taken (Figure S10). These images clearly displayed the disruption of the capsules,
which in turn results in the release of heparin to enhance the photothermal-mediated
thrombolysis. This is in line with previous publications in which
it was demonstrated that laser-induced temperature increase could
deconstruct the structural integrity of gold-incorporated polymers
to achieve controlled drug release.51−54 To prove the anti-thrombus function
of Hep, another control group was designed. As wall material, Hep
was replaced with alginate to construct the EM-JPMs, and these motors
were also evaluated regarding their performance in photothermal ablation
of thrombus at the same experimental conditions. As shown in Figure S11A and Video S6, thrombus models still maintained their initial state with a little
fluorescence quenching after laser illumination. Furthermore, two
other control groups were also investigated, including laser irradiation
in the absence of EM-JPMs (Figure S11B and Video S7) and in the presence of (CHI/Hep)5 capsules without gold coating (Figure S11C). Neither of them could induce the ablation of the thrombus.
From these experiments, it was proven that only EM-JPMs prepared by
Hep and CHI could achieve the efficient therapeutic effect toward
thrombus ablation.

Conclusion
In summary, a photothermal
thrombolytic platform based on erythrocyte
membrane-coated Janus capsule micromotors was developed. Upon NIR
irradiation, Janus capsules composed of biomolecules and partially
covered with a gold shell were able to generate a local temperature
gradient due to the strong surface plasmon resonance adsorption. The
asymmetric structure of EM-JPMs induced rapid motion by thermophoretic
force. The movement behavior of EM-JPMs could conveniently be modulated
by the NIR laser power, as validated experimentally. By coating the
JPMs with an erythrocyte membrane, the motors exhibited excellent
performance in movement in relevant biological environments. In addition
to providing a driving force, it was found that EM-JPMs could also
successfully ablate thrombus by photothermal therapy upon NIR irradiation.
This proof-of-concept study provides a motor-based therapeutic system
with the advantages of active transportation, high efficacy, and biological
compatibility.

Preparation of Janus Polymeric Motors
CHI/Hep microcapsules
were prepared by the LbL self-assembly method.55−57 Briefly, 1
mg/mL of CHI and Hep solution containing 0.1 M NaCl was alternatively
deposited on the surface of template microparticles under continuous
shaking for 15 min. Unassembled polymer was removed by washing three
times with 0.1 M NaCl. Fluorescein-labeled CHI/Hep microcapsules were
synthesized by adding one layer of rhodamine B–CHI during the
assembly process.58−60 In order to construct Janus capsule motors, a droplet
of the CHI/Hep microparticle solution was dropped on a hydrophilic
silica slide to form a monolayer of microparticles. After evaporation
in air, a turbo sputter coater (Quorum Technologies, K575X) was used
to coat one side of the polymeric particles with a thin gold layer
(65 mV, 30 s). Ultrasound treatment was used to redisperse the Janus
polymeric particles into aqueous solution. Next, 50 mg/mL of NH4F solution was then used to dissolve the silica template to
form Janus polymeric capsules with hollow structure. The morphology
of JPMs was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta
200, 3D FEG, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and confocal laser scanning
microscopy (Zeiss, LSM510 META, Germany). EDX elemental mapping analysis
of JPMs was obtained by SEM (Phenom ProX, The Netherlands).

Fabrication
of Erythrocyte Membrane-Camouflaged JPMs
The erythrocyte
membrane was isolated and prepared from peripheral
blood of healthy mice (Balb/c, male) by following the published protocols.61 The morphology of erythrocytes and the erythrocyte
membrane was characterized by using SEM and CLSM. EM-JPMs were obtained
according to a previously reported procedure.62 Briefly, JPMs were mixed with preobtained vesicle solution of erythrocyte
membrane and then cocultured for 4 h under gentle shaking at 4 °C.
To remove excess vesicles, the resulting solution was washed by centrifugation
three times. The as-prepared EM-JPMs were then characterized by DLS
(Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS), CLSM, BCA protein assay, and sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

Biocompatibility
and Biodegradability Assessment
Mouse
embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3) were selected for cytotoxicity
tests. NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 70% humidity.
Exponentially growing cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate and incubated
in cell culture medium until the cell concentration reached ∼90%.
After being washed with PBS, EM-JPMs with different volumes (0–80
μL, ∼4.9 × 105 per μL, counted
by using a hemocytometer) were added, followed by the standard MTT
assay. The biodegradability was tested by immersing JPMs into PBS
solution (1×, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. The
morphology was investigated by SEM immediately.

Motion Experiments
and Analysis
For movement experiments,
NIR laser propulsion was achieved by using a two-photon laser (Chameleon
Vision, Coherent, USA) at 760 nm as the power source. The obtained
JPMs and EM-JPMs were dispersed in PBS solution, cell culture medium,
FBS, and blood. The motion frames of JPMs and EM-JPMs were recorded
by CLSM (Zeiss, LSM510 META). All the motion experiments were performed
at room temperature. The motion coordinate information, tracking trajectories,
and further motion analysis were conducted by ImageJ. The mean square
displacement was calculated according to the published method, MSD
= (x(Δt) – x(0))2 + (y(Δt) – y(0))2.42−44 Diffusion coefficients
(D) were calculated according to the following equation, D = MSD/(i × Δt), where Δt is the time interval and i is the dimensional index.42−44 Here, i is equal to 4 for two-dimensional analysis.

Generation and Photothermal
Ablation of Thrombus Models
Thrombus models were established
by following the published protocols.63 Fibrinogen from human plasma (1 mg/mL) as the
physiological source of thrombus was dissolved in a solution of 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 140 mM NaCl. Thrombus formation was induced
by adding 1 U/mL thrombin and 2.5 mM CaCl2 to the fibrinogen
solution, which was then cultured at 37 °C for 1 h. A turbidity
assay was used to monitor the process of thrombus formation by measuring
the absorbance (340 nm) at 10 min intervals. Fluorescent-labeled thrombus
was formed by an additional supply of 10 μL of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
fibrinogen to the fibrinogen solution containing thrombin and CaCl2, followed by incubation at 50 °C for 2 h. The fluorescent
thrombus was characterized by CLSM (Leica, TCS SP5X). Thrombus models
and EM-JPMs (50 μL, ∼4.9 × 105 per μL)
in a μ-slide 8 well (ibidi, Germany) were irradiated with a
760 nm laser at a laser power of 2.43 J/cm2 (two-photon
laser, Chameleon Vision, Coherent, USA). Thrombus lysis was evaluated
by a fluorescence-based assay.
