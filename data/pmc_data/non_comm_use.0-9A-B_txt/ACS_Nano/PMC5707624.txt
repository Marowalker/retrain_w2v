Microemulsions
are extensively used in advanced material and chemical
processing. However, considerable amounts of surfactant are needed
for their formulation, which is a drawback due to both economic and
ecological reasons. Here, we describe the nanostructuration of recently
discovered surfactant-free, carbon dioxide (CO2)-based
microemulsion-like systems in a water/organic-solvent/CO2 pressurized ternary mixture. “Water-rich” nanodomains
embedded into a “water-depleted” matrix have been observed
and characterized by the combination of Raman spectroscopy, molecular
dynamics simulations, and small-angle neutron scattering. These single-phase
fluids show a reversible, pressure-responsive nanostructuration; the
“water-rich” nanodomains at a given pressure can be
instantaneously degraded/expanded by increasing/decreasing the pressure,
resulting in a reversible, rapid, and homogeneous mixing/demixing
of their content. This pressure-triggered responsiveness, together
with other inherent features of these fluids, such as the absence
of any contaminant in the ternary mixture (e.g., surfactant), their spontaneous formation, and their
solvation capability (enabling the dissolution of both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic molecules), make them appealing complex fluid systems
to be used in molecular material processing and in chemical engineering.

Microemulsions
are macroscopically
homogeneous, isotropic, and thermodynamically stable systems, containing
at least three compounds: a polar one, usually water, a nonpolar one,
usually oil, and an amphiphilic compound, usually a surfactant.1 These macroscopically homogeneous systems are
nanostructured in “oil-rich” and “water-rich”
domains, which can show various size and shape, depending on the composition
and the environmental conditions.2 The
structuration at the nanoscale entails other specific properties of
microemulsions, such as ultralow interfacial tension,3,4 large interfacial area,5 and the ability
to solubilize otherwise immiscible compounds.1,2 As
they contain both a polar and a nonpolar solvent, microemulsions have
been considered as universal solvents. Accordingly, they are very
appealing systems either as commercial products or as reaction media
for many processes, ranging from nanoparticle templates to preparative
confined organic chemistry.1,6 Furthermore, as they
form spontaneously, their preparation process is considered facile
and of low cost. However, a significant disadvantage of conventional
microemulsions is their reliance on the use of—sometimes highly
concentrated and environmentally malign—surfactants, which
are required in order to thermodynamically stabilize the system. This
in turn, affects their sustainability both in terms of costs and environmental
impact.

CO2-based microemulsions and surfactant-less
or surfactant-free
microemulsions have been extensively investigated as valuable greener
alternatives to conventional microemulsions since the late 1970s,
but only recently their structure has been investigated at the mesoscopic
scale.7−11 In CO2-based microemulsions, the oil phase is substituted
by compressed CO2 (cCO2). Compared to organic
solvents, cCO2 is low cost, nonflammable, environmentally
benign, bio- and food-compatible, and naturally abundant. Generally,
CO2 is a poor solvent, in particular for polar and/or high
molecular weight solutes,12 but when dissolved
in water in the presence of specific surfactants, a water/CO2-based microemulsion is formed. Mainly, fluorinated or partly fluorinated
surfactants have been used in order to form CO2-based microemulsions. However, they are expensive and environmentally
unviable, and nowadays many efforts are made in the design of small-cheap-safe
molecules able to stabilize the water/CO2 interface.12−17 Water/CO2-based microemulsions have the attractive characteristics
of cCO2 and the solvation properties of bulk water, being
a universal solvent for many applications. Furthermore, because of
the presence of cCO2, the properties of these unconventional
microemulsions, such as density, and hence solvation power, can be
strongly modified just by pressure variation.11,500 The latter feature is very attractive both from the fundamental
and technical point of view. This pressure responsiveness of the emulsion’s
properties is significantly less pronounced in conventional microemulsions,18 where in order to change the microemulsion’s
properties, composition and/or temperature are the more appropriate
tuning parameters.

In this context, we recently reported on
the structuration of the
single-phase mixture water/acetone/CO2 into “water-rich”
and “water-depleted” regions at 10 MPa and 308 K. It
has to be underlined that the structuration was observed in the single-phase
region, far from the critical point of the ternary mixture.19 Moreover, it has been already reported that
this pressurized mixture shows the capability to solubilize non-water
and non-CO2 soluble compounds, which are soluble in acetone
and in CO2-expanded acetone, such as ibuprofen. Indeed,
the addition of CO2 over an equimolar water/acetone mixture
saturated with ibuprofen, where a solid phase and a liquid phase coexist
at 10 MPa and 308 K, induces the solubilization of the precipitated
CO2-phobic drug. This behavior can be explained if the
addition of CO2 causes a structuration at the nanoscale
in “water-rich” regions and in “water-depleted”
domains, where the ibuprofen is dissolved (see SI for more details).19,20

The here studied
structured single-phase system is referred to
as “microemulsion-like system” rather than microemulsion,19 as it is not clear yet whether or not the acetone
takes over the role of the surfactant. In this paper, we report on
the nanostructuration of differently composed water/acetone/CO2 mixtures, at various temperatures (298, 308, and 328 K) and
pressures (10, 14, 18, and 22 MPa), by means of Raman spectroscopy.
Moreover, we also describe the nanostructuration of pressurized mixtures
of water/acetonitrile/CO2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
were performed to study the molecular nanostructuration with atomistic
detail. The size of the “water-rich” domains in these
pressurized mixtures was experimentally characterized by high-pressure
small-angle neutron scattering (hp-SANS). By using hp-SANS we have
also observed that the nanostructure is pressure responsive, in a
reversible way. These single-phase, nanostructured fluids have several
of the favorable properties of conventional microemulsions in terms
of interfacial properties, solvent capability, and ability to act
as templates (nanocontainers), with the advantages of being “green”
and showing a reversible, pressure-responsive nanostructure. We expect
that by pressure changes, we can instantaneously tune the extent of
the fluid’s nanostructure, resulting in a rapid and homogeneous
exchange of species between the multiple nanodomains, that is, mixing/demixing
of the fluid. This can open not yet anticipated pathways in process
engineering, making these nanostructured pressure-responsive fluids
appealing systems to be used in molecular material processing and
in chemical engineering.

Results/Discussion
The tendency
of water molecules to aggregate in the different pressurized
ternary mixtures of water/acetone/CO2 and water/acetonitrile/CO2 and to form a thermodynamically stable single-phase fluid
with “water-rich” nanodomains embedded into a “water-depleted”
matrix has been explored, using a range of complementary experimental
and computational techniques.

Figure 1 shows schematic
Gibbs phase diagrams of the different ternary systems water/organic-solvent/CO2 at 10 MPa studied.

Figure 1 Schematic Gibbs diagrams of the ternary systems
water/organic-solvent/CO2 based on data from literature
(refs (21 and 22)) and data reported
in Table 1. Solid colored
lines
show qualitatively the binodals of the system water/acetone/CO2 (10 MPa) at 298 K (blue), 308 K (green), and 328 K (red).
For the system water/acetonitrile/CO2, the binodal has
been measured experimentally at 308 K and 10 MPa and is shown by the
dotted line (see SI). The gray arrows show
the CO2 dilution paths of the initial “water/acetone”
systems when CO2 is added to the mixture until the binodal.
The solid black arrow shows the organic solvent dilution path when
the initial mixtures are diluted by the addition of more organic solvent.

The colored solid curves were
extracted from refs (21 and 22) and were partly measured (see Table 1), showing qualitatively
the binodals of the system water/acetone/CO2 at three different
temperatures, which separate the single-phase
region from the two-phase region. The dotted curve corresponds to
the binodal of the system water/acetonitrile/CO2 at 308
K and 10 MPa, and it has been experimentally determined (see SI). The solid black arrow on the water/organic
solvent (acetone or acetonitrile) axis shows the dilution path when
an initial binary water/organic-solvent mixture (marked with a star)
is diluted with additional acetone (or acetonitrile). The gray arrows
show for 298 K the CO2 dilution paths when an initial binary
water/acetone mixture is diluted with CO2 in the single-phase
region (not exceeding the binodal). Depending on the nature of the
organic solvent (acetone vs acetonitrile) as well as on the starting
binary mixture composition or the temperature or pressure, the length
of the CO2 dilution path in the single-phase region (before
intersection with the binodal) varies.

a When water/acetone mixtures of
different initial molar ratios (50/50, 60/40, and 75/25) are diluted
with CO2 either at 10 MPa but at different temperatures
or at 308 K but at different pressures.

Table 1 lists the
experimentally determined locations where the CO2-dilution
path (gray arrows in Figure 1), starting with different initial water/acetone mixture compositions,
crosses the binodal, for the ternary mixture water/acetone/CO2 at various pressures and temperatures. With increasing temperature,
the molar fraction of CO2 at the crossing point of the
binodal and the CO2-dilution-path increases, while the
fractions of acetone and water slightly decrease. All dilution paths
were realized isothermally and isobarically in a variable-volume high-pressure
chamber. With dilution, the total amount of water molecules in the
variable-volume high-pressure chamber is constant, while the water
concentration in “moles per liters” decreases when the
volume of the chamber has to be varied in order to dilute isobarically.

Intuitively, if the water concentration decreases homogeneously,
less hydrogen bonds between water molecules are formed. For example,
the number of hydrogen bonds decreases monotonically, if an initial
binary water/acetone mixture is diluted with additional acetone at
10 MPa and 308 K (black arrow mixing path in Figure 1), as it has been demonstrated in Hankel et al.19 and as it is shown in
the Supporting Information (SI). On the
contrary, if the dilution induces a nanostructuration into “water-concentrated”
regions, containing many water molecules, and “water-less-concentrated”
regions, containing few water molecules, the number of hydrogen bonds
increases. Experimentally, this can be studied by the use of Raman
spectroscopy; while diluting, we analyzed the frequency (energy) of
the symmetric water stretch vibration band. From the shape of this
Raman band, the development of hydrogen bonds can be extracted. In
particular, we use the Raman shift v̅water in wavenumbers (cm–1) of the centroid of the symmetric
water stretch vibration Raman broad band for the characterization
of the development of hydrogen bonds, as described in the SI. The smaller v̅water is, the more hydrogen bonds are developed in the mixture.24−27

The
Ternary System Water/Acetone/CO2
Figure 2 shows the Raman
shift of the centroid of the symmetric water stretch vibration band v̅water as a function of the water concentration cwater for the dilution of three different binary
mixtures of water/acetone (molar ratio) 50/50, 60/40, and 75/25 (columns
in Figure 2) upon the
addition of CO2 at 298, 308, and 328 K (lines in Figure 2) at a pressure of
10 MPa. In each subfigure of Figure 2, the dilution of the initially binary water/acetone
mixtures (right data points) with CO2 goes from large to
small water concentration values (from right to left). The left data
points are the last measurements made in the single-phase region.
A further dilution with CO2 drove the mixture across the
binodal into the two-phase region. Thus, all the data points shown
in the figure correspond to mixture compositions in the single-phase
region of the ternary system, before crossing the binodal. Each data
point is the average of 200 single Raman measurements. The acquisition
of one Raman spectrum took 5 s. The standard deviation of v̅water is given by the error bars. While
the ordinate of each subfigure covers consistently a range of six
wavenumbers, the absolute values of v̅water vary significantly from subfigure to subfigure. The smallest
values of v̅water can be found at
298 K for the CO2 dilution of the initial 75/25 water/acetone
mixture, which implies that at the lower temperatures and the larger
water concentrations, many hydrogen bonds are developed. The largest
values of v̅water can be found at
328 K for the CO2 dilution of the initial 50/50 water/acetone
mixture, which implies that at the higher temperatures and the smaller
water concentrations, less hydrogen bonds are developed.

Figure 2 v̅water as a function of the
water concentration cwater when three
initially binary water/acetone mixtures are diluted with CO2 at 298, 308, and 328 K at 10 MPa. Only one temperature (308 K) was
analyzed for the initial 60/40 water/acetone binary mixture.

The data measured for 328 K show
the behavior expected for a system
that does not develop a nanostructuration. The Raman shift of the
centroid of the symmetric water stretch vibration band v̅water increases monotonically with decreasing cwater, irrespectively of the composition of
the initial water/acetone mixture. Therefore, at 328 K the development
of hydrogen bonds gets less pronounced with increasing CO2 dilution. For 308 K and 298 K, the data rows show a maximum of v̅water. Starting from the initial binary
mixtures, v̅water first increases
with CO2 dilution, until the maximum of v̅water is reached, and then decreases with further CO2 dilution.

Therefore, at 308 K and 298 K, the development
of hydrogen bonds
with increasing CO2 dilution first declines to a minimum,
which is the maximum of v̅water,
and then rises. The rise of the development of hydrogen bonds with
increasing CO2 dilution is due to the emergence of a nanostructuration
of the ternary mixture in “water-concentrated” regions
containing many water molecules and “water-depleted”
regions containing few water molecules. This hypothesis will be further
underlined by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments and
by MD simulations. The overall change of v̅water during one CO2 dilution experiment increases
with increasing temperature from 298 K to 308 K and with decreasing
water content in the initial binary water/acetone mixture. For the
CO2 dilution of the 75/25 initial binary water/acetone-mixture
at 308 K, a maximum of v̅water is
hardly detectable. Finally we want to underline that the CO2 dilution path starting from the initial 75/25 binary water/acetone
mixture is the closest to the critical point of the ternary system.
For this CO2 dilution path, we find the smallest change
of v̅water as a function of the
water concentration. Therefore, we can conclude that the nanostructuration
we observed is different from critical fluctuations, which would reach
their maximum at the mixture critical point.26

Figure 3 shows
the
Raman shift of the centroid of the symmetric water stretch vibration
band v̅water as a function of the
CO2 molar fraction xCO2 for the dilution of initial 50/50 water/acetone mixtures at
308 K for pressures of 10, 14, 18, and 22 MPa. In contrast to Figure 2, in Figure 3 we scale on the abscissa the
CO2 molar fraction xCO2 instead of the water concentration, cwater. This assures a better comparability with the hp-SANS
results that follow. Nevertheless, the CO2 molar fractions xCO2 are correlated with the corresponding
water concentrations cwater on the left
ordinate. As the dilution is realized by the addition of CO2, the CO2 dilution in Figure 3 proceeds from left to right, meaning that
the very left data points correspond to the binary water/acetone mixtures
at 308 K at the different pressures before the addition of CO2. The very right data points represent the last measurement
made in the single-phase region. A further addition of CO2 drove the system across the binodal into the two-phase region. As
already mentioned above, the experimentally determined compositions
of the binodal are shown in Table 1.

Figure 3 v̅water (right ordinate)
as a
function of the CO2 molar fraction xCO2 of the ternary mixture water/acetone/CO2 when binary water/acetone mixtures of an initial 50/50 molar
relation are diluted with CO2 at 308 K and at 10, 14, 18,
and 22 MPa. The water concentration as a function of the CO2 molar fraction is also given (left ordinate). Regions of nanostructuration
are highlighted in blue.

In each subfigure in Figure 3 the ordinate quantifying v̅water comprises six wavenumbers (cm–1). Irrespective
of pressure (within the analyzed range), v̅water first increases when the system is diluted by the
addition of CO2 (from left to right). Therefore, the development
of hydrogen bonds first decreases until the maximum of v̅water is reached. With further addition of CO2 the system undergoes a nanostructuration in “water-concentrated”
regions containing many water molecules and “water-depleted”
regions containing few water molecules, which is expressed by the
decrease of v̅water. The higher
the pressure is, the larger CO2 molar fractions are required
for the initialization of the nanostructuration (this is highlighted
in Figure 3 by blue
shadows). A ternary mixture with a CO2 molar fraction of xCO2 = 0.15 at 10 MPa and 308 K (upper
subfigure) is further in the region of nanostructuration than a mixture
with the same composition but at higher pressure and the same temperature
(lower subfigures). With increasing pressure, the minimum xCO2 value, for which nanostructuration
is detectable (maximum of v̅water), moves to larger xCO2 values
and at the same time also the xCO2 values that correspond to the binodal increase (see Table 1).

The Ternary
System Water/Acetonitrile/CO2
Figure 4 shows the
Raman shift of the centroid of the symmetric water stretch vibration
band v̅water as a function of the
water concentration for the dilution of two different binary mixtures
of water/acetonitrile with 50/50 and 40/60 molar relationships. At
328 K v̅water increases monotonically
with CO2 dilution, irrespective of the initial mixture
composition. This indicates that with CO2 dilution, the
hydrogen bonds develop less. At 298 K, v̅water decreases from the very beginning of the CO2 dilution, irrespective of the initial binary mixture composition
indicating that initially more hydrogen bonds develop. The maximum
development of hydrogen bonds is found for 298 K at the minimum of v̅water.

Figure 4 v̅water as a function of the
water concentration cwater when two initially
binary water/acetonitrile mixtures with 40/60 and 50/50 molar relationships
are diluted with CO2 at 298, 308, and 323 K, at 10 MPa.

For the ternary systems water/acetone/CO2 and water/acetonitrile/CO2 at 10 MPa, we can summarize
that the behavior of v̅water as
a function of the water concentration cwater significantly depends on the temperature.
At the highest analyzed temperature of 328 K, v̅water increased monotonically with CO2 dilution
for each initial binary mixture composition. Whereas at the lowest
analyzed temperature of 298 K, v̅water decreased with CO2 dilution either from the very beginning
or after reaching a maximum. At the intermediate temperature
of 308 K, the behavior of v̅water as a function of cwater is in between
the behaviors identified for 298 and 328 K. With this observation
together with the temperature sensitivity of the binodal curves shown
in Figure 1 and Table 1, we can deduce that,
for a given initial binary mixture composition, the behavior of v̅water as a function of cwater depends on the length of the CO2 dilution
path in the single-phase region, before phase separation, or in other
words on the solubility (quantified as CO2 molar fraction)
of CO2 in the ternary mixture. This statement is also underlined
by the results shown in the context of the pressure variation (Figure 3). Again we can deduct
from Table 1 that for
the 50/50 initial binary water/acetone mixture, the behavior of v̅water as a function of xCO2 depends on the length of the CO2 dilution path in the single-phase region, before phase separation,
or in other words on the solubility (quantified as CO2 molar
fraction) of CO2 in the ternary mixture at various pressures.
The lower the solubility of CO2 in the ternary water/organic
solvent/CO2 mixtures is, the more pronounced is the extent
of nanostructuration in “water-concentrated” regions
and “water-depleted” regions (see Table 1).

Dimensions and Shape of “Water-Rich”
Nanodomains
SANS succeeds in probing structural heterogeneities
over spatial
scales on the order of several Å up to 100 nm and, as such, has
been successfully exploited by several teams to characterize microemulsion
systems over mesoscopic spatial scales.2,27 Here, in order
to get direct structural insight into the complex mesoscopic organization
of the pressurized water/organic solvent/CO2 systems, we
used a specially designed high-pressure SANS cell.28

In Figure 5, the hp-SANS data are presented for different mixtures water/deuterated
acetone/CO2 at 308 K and 10 MPa, as a function of the dissolved
amount of CO2 and as a function of the water concentration cwater. These data sets are plotted together
with the pattern of the binary equimolar mixture water/deuterated
acetone at the same experimental conditions (pressure, temperature).
While the latter data set shows a small excess scattering with respect
to the flat incoherent scattering due to hydrogen, in agreement with
previous determinations,29,30 upon CO2 addition a distinct increase of the scattering amplitude can be
observed in the low Q range that is presently accessed
(0.01 ≤ Q (Å) ≤ 0.1). This fingerprints
the progressive development of structural heterogeneities with spatial
extent of the order of a few nanometers. Related scattering studies
that were focused on other surfactant-free microemulsion systems (e.g., water/ethanol/octanol)7−10,31 highlighted comparable diffraction
features in the low Q portion of the SANS patterns.
The present hp-SANS data sets have been modeled in terms of the Ornstein–Zernike
(O-Z) model that allows to estimate the characteristic size of the
structural heterogeneities responsible for the excess low Q scattering, namely:  where I(0) represents the
normalized scattering intensity at zero angle and ξ is the spatial
extent of the structural heterogeneities.7

Figure 5 SANS
curves of water/deuterated acetone/CO2 mixtures,
with xwater = xacetone = (1 – xCO2)/2 and xCO2 = 0, 0.07, 0.12, and 0.14 (cwater = 11.50, 10.47, 9.91, 9.68 mol L–1) at 308 K and 10 MPa. The lines refer to fits of experimental data
to the Ornstein–Zernike model, excluding the Q portion below 0.01 Å. The upturn might reflect larger structural
heterogeneities that the present hp-SANS experiment does not provide
access to. In the inset, the dependence of the characteristic size
for the structural heterogeneities as a function of the CO2 molar fraction responsible for the low Q excess
scattering is plotted.

In the inset of Figure 5, the CO2 content dependence of ξ
is shown,
indicating that when adding CO2 to the water/acetone equimolar
mixture, the formation of segregated clusters (nanostructuration)
occurs, whose spatial extent grows with CO2 content and
reaches a size of approximately 2.5 nm at xCO2 = 0.14 (cwater = 9.682
mol L–1). This finding correlates well with the
decrease of the centroid of the Raman band v̅water with CO2 dilution for water concentrations
between 10.5 and 9.5 mol L–1 for the ternary system
water/acetone/CO2 at 308 K and 10 MPa reported in Figure 2.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Using MD
simulations,
we can provide an atomistic interpretation of the experimental results.
To this end, we performed all-atomic MD simulations of water/acetone
and water/acetone/CO2 mixtures with eight different water
concentrations at 10 MPa and 308 K (see Methods for technical details). In each MD simulation we started with binary
mixtures of water and acetone (xwater = xacetone = 0.5). For the dilution with acetone
we added more acetone molecules to the initial mixture, obtaining
binary mixtures with decreasing molar fractions of water (black arrow
in Figure 1). For the
CO2 dilution path, we added more CO2 molecules
(gray arrow in Figure 1). In this way we obtained simulations of ternary water/acetone/CO2 mixtures with different amounts of CO2, keeping
constant the number of acetone and water molecules. Note that all
simulations contain the same number of water molecules. In the first
set of simulations, the water concentration decreases due to the addition
of acetone, while in the second simulation set, the water concentration
decreases due to the addition of CO2.

For all simulations
we computed the number Nw–w of
hydrogen bonds of each water molecule with other water molecules (water–water
hydrogen bonds), and we divided this quantity by the result obtained
for the initial water/acetone 50/50 mixture, Nw–w(0). The resulting ratio, RHbonds = Nw–w/Nw–w(0) is shown in Figure 6. As it can be seen
in Figure 6, the dilution
with acetone induces a decrease of RHbonds as the concentration of water decreases. On the contrary, in the
case of dilution with CO2, we observe a nearly constant RHbonds, though the concentration of water decreases.
In fact, a careful look at Figure 6 shows a very weak dependence of RHbonds with water concentration in the ternary system,
with a slight decrease of RHbonds to a
minimum and a subsequent slight increase. The simulation results reported
in Figure 6 are in
complete agreement with the interpretation of Raman experiments provided
in the previous section and in our previous work.19

Figure 6 Evolution of the number of water–water hydrogen bonds in
MD simulations at 308 K and 10 MPa after dilution of an initial water/acetone
50/50 mixture. We consider dilution by adding acetone (circles) or
CO2 (triangles). RHbonds is
defined as the ratio between the number of water–water hydrogen
bonds observed in a particular simulation divided by the number of
water–water hydrogen bonds obtained in the initial water/acetone
50/50 mixture which contains the same number of water molecules.

The nanostructuration postulated
by the analysis of Raman and SANS
experimental results can also be seen in our MD simulations. In Figure 7, we show simulation
images for a ternary mixture with xCO2 = 0.15 and xwater = xacetone = 0.425. As it can be seen in Figure 7a, acetone molecules are homogeneously
distributed over the whole system, but water is localized in pockets
containing hydrogen-bonded water molecules. These water pockets induce
inhomogeneities in the water density profiles (see Figure S7 in the SI), which have a typical length scale of ∼2
nm. Inside these water pockets, water molecules form hydrogen-bonded
chain structures, as illustrated in Figure 7b (see also the pair correlation functions
reported in Figure S8 in the SI). The average
number of hydrogen bonded neighbors of a water molecule is 2. On average,
we found that in these chain-like structures, 48% of the water molecules
have two hydrogen bonds, and with other water molecules, 28% had only
one and 24% more than 2 hydrogen bonds. Acetone also makes
hydrogen bonds with water through the carbonyl group (Figure 7b), as demonstrated by the
sharp peak in the acetone–water pair correlation function (Figure
S8 in the SI). CO2 molecules
avoid contact with water-concentrated pockets. The broad peaks in
the CO2 correlation functions (Figure S8 in the SI indicates that CO2 molecules tend
to be coordinated both with other CO2 molecules and acetone
molecules). In Figure 7c we also show a typical configuration contributing to these broad
peaks in the CO2–CO2 and CO2–acetone correlation functions. Typically, we found two or
three CO2 molecules (with C–C distance about 4 Å)
surrounded by acetone molecules (with a peak at a carbon–carbon
separation of 4.4 Å). Water also tends to be anticorrelated with
(effectively repelled by) CO2, up to distances of about
1 nm.

Pressure-Responsiveness
of Nanostructured, Single-Phase Liquid
The hp-SANS measurements
were performed at different pressures.
For this study the ternary mixture water/deuterated acetone/CO2 with xCO2 = 0.15 (xwater = xacetone = 0.425) at 10 MPa and 308 K was used. The effect of the increase
of pressure, from 10 to 30 MPa, was determined by a stepwise pressure
increase in increments of 4 MPa. After that, the pressure is reduced
back from 30 to 10 MPa, in order to rule-out any hysteresis phenomenon.
The data are presented in Figure 8 as a function of pressure. In particular, the description
of the scattering data in terms of the O-Z model allows detecting
a progressive decrease of the scattering amplitude upon pressure increase.
The isothermal compressibility of the ternary water/acetone/CO2 mixture (xwater = xacetone = 0.43 and xCO2 = 0.14) as a function of pressure was measured and is shown
in Figure S2a in the SI, aiming at addressing
the source of scattering amplitude decrease. The ternary mixture has
a lower isothermal compressibility than that of pure CO232 (4.1 × 10–2 to
5.5 × 10–3 MPa–1 for pure
CO2 and 6.8 × 10–4 to 6.9 ×
10–4 MPa–1 for the ternary mixture,
respectively). In fact, the values of compressibility we measured
for the ternary mixture at elevated pressure are between the corresponding
compressibility values of pure water and pure acetone at ambient conditions.
Moreover, the compressibility of the ternary mixture slightly increases
with pressure (<2%), showing an opposite trend to that observed
for pure CO2 (pronounced decrease, ca.
80%, Figure S2b in the SI). According to
the relationship I(0)= nKBTκ33 (where n is the number density of scatterers (heterogeneities), KB is Boltzmann constant, T is
temperature, and κ is the isothermal compressibility), the low Q limit of the normalized scattering intensity I(0) should increase with increasing pressure, following the trend
of the compressibility of the ternary mixture. In Figure 8, the opposite trend is observed.
We can then rule out the effect of compressibility in affecting the
amplitude of the low Q scattering and directly relate
it to the decreasing average size of the segregated domains with increasing
pressure (see inset of Figure 8), which is proportional to the scattering domains’
volume. All of these observations reveal that these single-phase fluids
feature a pressure-responsive extent of nanostructuration. This finding
allows proposing pressure as an effective tool to affect the segregated
morphology in these systems. Similar conclusions were drawn from the
results shown in Figure 3, where we saw that the higher the pressure is, the more CO2 is needed for the appearance of the nanostructuraction. This, in
other words, means that at equal composition (i.e., xwater = xacetone = 0.425 and xCO2 = 0.15) and temperature, the extent of the nanostructuraction
is tunable by pressure.

Figure 8 SANS curves for the system water/deuterated
acetone/CO2, with xwater = xacetone = 0.425 and xCO2 = 0.15 at 308 K and different values of pressure in
the range between
10 and 30 MPa. The lines refer to fits of experimental data to the
Ornstein–Zernike model, excluding the Q range
below 0.01 Å–1. In the inset, the pressure
dependence of scattering amplitude and characteristic size for the
structural heterogeneities are shown.

Furthermore, hp-SANS was used to monitor the reversibility
of the
formation of the nanostructuration upon cyclic pressure jumps. In Figure 9, we show two different
data sets at 14 and 30 MPa that were obtained by raising the pressure
(14 → 30 MPa in several steps), then decreasing (30 →
14 MPa in several steps) it, and then raising (14 → 30 MPa
in one step) it again. As it can be seen, the two data sets obtained
at the same nominal pressure nicely lay on top of each other, thus
providing experimental support to the reversibility of the extent
of nanostructuration upon pressure modulation.

Figure 9 SANS curves for system
water/deuterated acetone/CO2,
with xwater = xacetone = 0.425 and xCO2 = 0.15 at
308 K and 14 or 30 MPa. The different data sets at a given pressure
refer to different routes used to reach these pressure values, aiming
at confirming the lack of process hysteresis in the formation/decomposition
of nanoaggregates.

Conclusions and Future
Perspectives
The combination of Raman spectroscopy, hp-SANS,
and MD simulations
provides valuable complementary insights into the appearance of “water-rich”
nanodomains within the pressurized, single-phase mixtures of water/organic
solvent/CO2, both in the case of acetone and acetonitrile
being the organic solvent. Raman spectroscopy reveals the occurrence
of water molecules aggregation, that is, the formation of “water-concentrated”
regions, and clarifies how the thermodynamic conditions, that is,
composition, temperature, and pressure, affect this phenomenon. hp-SANS
measurements provide information about the characteristic size of
these “water-rich” nanodomains, and MD simulations clarify
how the molecules are localized within the ternary mixture and supports
experimental findings. The final outcome is that these ternary mixtures
water/organic solvent/CO2 can turn into a surfactant-free
microemulsion-like system, where “water-concentrated”
nanodomains, with a characteristic size of the order of 2 nm, are
embedded in a “water-depleted” matrix. The aggregation
of water molecules occurs when CO2 is added to a binary
mixture of water/organic solvent. hp-SANS measurements show that the
nanostructure of these surfactant-free fluids can be reversibly tuned
by pressure variations. We can distinguish between an “ON”
state, where the nanostructuraction is occurring at a large extent,
and an “OFF” state, where by progressively increasing
the pressure (above 10 MPa), the medium remains macroscopically homogeneous,
but the structural heterogeneities start to drastically decrease in
their extent (see the abstract graphic). This reversible, pressure
responsiveness is completely missed in conventional microemulsions,
where changes in their nanoscopic structure require temperature and/or
compositional variations, which propagate much slower through the
mixture, thus making jumps
in the activating parameters (temperature or concentration) less efficient
and/or less homogeneous. We expect to exploit the herein presented
pressure responsiveness together with the already proved solvent capability
of these nanostructured green fluids19 (see
Figure S9 in the SI for more details) in
order to use them in chemical and process engineering. In fact, if
we think to apply the revealed “water-rich” nanodomains
embedded in a water-depleted matrix as nanocontainers, when in “ON”
mode, then these nanocontainers can instantaneously be destroyed by
pressure changes, resulting in a rapid and homogeneous mixing/demixing
of the containers’ contents. From the technological point of
view, by using these fluids we can imagine to create innovative pathways
in process engineering and for the manufacturing of products with
a high degree of control over material properties.

Methods
Microemulsion Preparation and Materials
Nanostructured
systems have been prepared in a homemade, high-pressure visual variable
volume cell (HPVVVC), which is described in the SI (Figure S1). Acetone (Uvasol) and acetonitrile (LiChrosolv)
purchased from Merck Millipore (Germany) both with a purity of 99.9%
as well as CO2 4.5 purchased from Linde (Germany) with
a purity of 99.995% were used without further purification. Water
was highly purified (conductivity <18 μS cm–1) in house by an ion-exchange water system (SG 2800 SK, SG Wasseraufbereitung
and Regenerierstation, Germany). For hp-SANS measurements, acetone
(Uvasol) has been replaced by its perdeuterated form (99.9 atom %
D) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

Experimental Characterization
The miscibility gap of
the ternary mixture was identified using the cloud-point method as
described in detail in the SI. Data have
been collected for water/organic solvent/CO2 mixtures at
various compositions and temperatures. The Raman spectra of water,
acetone, CO2, and their mixtures have been acquired using
the setup described in the SI (Figure S3)
and are reported in Figure S4. The water
symmetric stretch vibration band has been isolated from the Raman
spectrum of the mixture as described in SI. The Raman shift (wavenumber position) of the centroid of the isolated
symmetric water stretch vibration signal was computed and considered
as an indicator for the development of hydrogen bonds. Small Raman
shift values of the centroid indicate that many hydrogen bonds are
developed. Large Raman shift values of the centroid indicate that
few hydrogen bonds are developed. High-pressure small-angle neutron
scattering (hp-SANS) measurements were performed at the Institut Laue-Langevin
(Grenoble, FR) (beamline D11). Data were collected using an incident
neutron wavelength of 6 Å with 9% fwhm and working at two different
sample–detector distances (1.75 and 10 m); this setup allows
reaching a momentum transfer range between 0.007 and 3.5 Å–1. A high-pressure cell, previously described by Pütz et al., was utilized for the measurements.34,35 Further technical details are provided in the SI.

Computer Simulations
The all atomic
molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations reported here were performed using the NAMD 2.9 software36 with a thermostat at 308 K and a barostat at
10 MPa. In our simulations, water was described employing the TIP4P/2005
model,37 which is known to correctly reproduce
the phase diagram of water, both at low and high pressures.38 This model is also the best available in reproducing
the hydrogen-bonding features of liquid water at all pressures.39 CO2 and acetone were described using
the CGenFF version of the CHARMM force field.40 We performed four simulations of a binary water/acetone mixture
and also four simulations of the ternary water/acetone/CO2 mixture, all corresponding to different compositions but always
at 308 K and 10 MPa. The first simulation was performed with a binary
mixture with initially the same number of acetone and water molecules
(xwater = xacetone). This simulation was the starting point for two different simulations
series, one series corresponding to dilution with acetone (binary
water/acetone mixtures) and the second series corresponding to dilution
with CO2 (water/acetone/CO2 ternary mixtures).
Note that the ternary water/acetone/CO2 mixture simulations
correspond to different amounts of CO2 but always with xwater = xacetone. Further details of the simulation protocol are described in the SI.
