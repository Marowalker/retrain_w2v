Nucleic acid nanostructures
have attracted significant interest
as potential therapeutic and diagnostic platforms due to their intrinsic
biocompatibility and biodegradability, structural and functional diversity,
and compatibility with various chemistries for modification and stabilization.
Among the fabrication approaches for such structures, the rolling
circle techniques have emerged as particularly promising, producing
morphologically round, flower-shaped nucleic acid particles: typically
hybrid composites of long nucleic acid strands and inorganic magnesium
pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi). These constructs are known to form via anisotropic nucleic acid-driven crystallization in a
sequence-independent manner, rendering monodisperse and densely packed
RNA or DNA–inorganic composites. However, it still remains
to fully explore how flexible polymer-like RNA or DNA strands (acting
as biomolecular additives) mediate the crystallization process of
Mg2PPi and affect the structure and properties of the product
crystals. To address this, we closely examined nanoscale details to
mesoscopic features of Mg2PPi/DNA hybrid composites fabricated
by two approaches, namely rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based in situ synthesis and long synthetic DNA-mediated crystallization.
Similar to the DNA constructs fabricated by RCA, the rapid crystallization
of Mg2PPi was retarded on a short-range order when we precipitated
the crystals in the presence of presynthesized long DNA, which resulted
in effective incorporation of biomolecular additives such as DNA and
enzymes. These findings further provide a more feasible way to encapsulate
bioactive enzymes within DNA constructs compared to in situ RCA-mediated synthesis, i.e., by not only protecting
them from possible denaturation under the reaction conditions but
also preventing nonselective association of proteins arising from
the RCA reaction mixtures.

Biomimetic
crystallization methods
have been exploited to build functional materials with a variety of
specialized and complex properties similar to naturally occurring
biominerals.1,2 Such methods involve homogeneous
or heterogeneous nucleation and growth of organic and inorganic phases
in materials, inducing highly ordered, hierarchical structures with
well-defined morphologies, sizes, and polymorphs.2,3 In
such a way, one can generate DNA–inorganic hybrid composites
mainly composed of DNA and magnesium pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi), generated by rolling circle techniques such as rolling circle
amplification (RCA) or transcription (RCT) based on isothermal enzymatic
polymerization.4,5 In contrast to DNA nanostructures
assembled by Watson–Crick base pairing, they form morphologically
spherical, flower-like nucleic acid particles through in situ nucleic acid-driven crystallization of metal salts (here Mg2PPi) generated during the reaction.5−8 Due to their large surface areas
and highly porous structures, coupled with intrinsic DNA and RNA properties
and functionalities, these RCA- or RCT-based nano-/microparticles
are of utility for biomedical applications.4−6,8−15 However, further study is needed on how the presence of long DNA
or RNA as organic additives and structure-directing agents—whether
they are in situ synthesized or presynthesized—can
modulate the Mg2PPi crystal growth and direct the outcome
structures of particles during the RCA or RCT process.

Indeed,
there is a lack of reports showing how the Mg2PPi crystals
evolve chemically and morphologically by the introduction
of DNA or RNA molecules during the reaction. While Shopsowitz et al. demonstrated that addition of RNA into a certain
concentration of Mg2PPi dramatically changed the particle
morphology compared to that without RNA,7 more substantial evidence is required to fully understand the role
of the produced RNA molecules during the RCT process. Apart from the
typical RCA-based fabrication of DNA particles, various RCA-inspired
approaches have been recently proposed by focusing more on the critical
role of divalent cations in controlling size, morphology, and functionality
of the resulting DNA particles.16−18 These approaches present an effective
route for preparation of functional DNA-inorganic hybrid particles.
However, studying how the inclusion of long DNA serving as organic
additives in Mg2PPi crystal growth affects the molecular
interaction between DNA and inorganic crystals still remains unexplored.
These organic macromolecules appear to be intimately associated with
the Mg2PPi phase through mainly electrostatic interaction
in common with RCA-driven in situ formation of DNA
particles, where multiple interactions occur between growing DNA and
Mg2PPi over time.

Moreover, the majority of characterizations
of RCA- or RCT-based
particles have so far focused on their surface morphology, composition,
and size using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM
and TEM). In terms of nanostructural investigation, multimodal coherent
X-ray diffraction analysis of RCT-mediated RNA microparticles (termed
RNAi microsponges) recently revealed the existence of a dense internal
core region within the particles.19 This
technique allows for two- and three-dimensional electron density imaging
of such biological materials at the nanoscale. However, this method
does not provide detailed chemical and atomic information that would
demonstrate molecular relationships between organic and inorganic
matter within the RNAi microsponges.

Here, we studied and identified
the differences in the nanostructural
morphology, chemical composition, atomic bonding configuration, and
crystallinity of various Mg2PPi/DNA composites prepared
by two RCA-inspired approaches. We used various advanced characterization
methods, including high-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) imaging in combination with energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy.

Results and Discussion
Motivated by our previous study,8 we
further question how presynthesized long DNA (specifically isolated
from the RCA) can affect the structure and chemical pathways controlling
the organization process of Mg2PPi crystals in comparison
to in situ synthesized DNA-driven Mg2PPi
growth. To address this, we designed two strategies for fabrication
of Mg2PPi/DNA hybrid composites based on (1) in
situ RCA-driven synthesis and (2) a synthetic DNA-directed
crystallization method (Scheme 1). During the in situ synthesis, continuously
growing DNA strands and Mg2PPi crystals formed hierarchical,
flower-shaped DNA structures (termed DNF hereafter) for the desired
reaction time (20 h in this study). On the other hand, in the synthetic
DNA-driven crystallization method, we first solely isolated the amplified
DNA (AmpDNA) from the products after 20 h RCA in the presence of inorganic
pyrophosphatase (PPase) through subsequent purification by ethanol
precipitation. After removal of salts and proteins, the resulting
AmpDNA was then precipitated out in a neutral buffer containing concentrated
Mg and PPi ions (for 20 h) in order to produce another class of DNA-inorganic
hybrid composites (termed Mg2PPi/AmpDNA hereafter).

Scheme 1 Overview of the Fabrication of DNA-Inorganic Hybrid Composites
Key: (1) DNA flowers (DNF)
constructed by a one-pot enzymatic process using rolling circle amplification
(RCA) and (2) Mg2PPi/AmpDNA composites formed by synthetic
DNA-driven crystallization, in which abundant Mg and PPi ions precipitated
in the presence of amplified DNA (AmpDNA). The AmpDNA was obtained
from the RCA reaction with the addition of pyrophosphatase (PPase)
and subsequent ethanol precipitation. Deoxynucleoside triphosphate
(dNTP), deoxynucleoside monophosphate (dNMP), phi29 DNA polymerase
(φ29 DNAP), pyrophosphate (PPi, P2O7),
phosphate (Pi), magnesium pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi), and magnesium
hydrogen phosphate (MgHPi).

In the RCA reaction,
the phi29 DNA polymerase (φ29 DNAP)
simultaneously produces DNA strands and pyrophosphate (PPi4–) ions in a time-dependent manner.8 The
released anionic PPi ions tend to form insoluble Mg2PPi
precipitates with cationic magnesium (Mg2+) ions supplied
from the reaction buffer when they reach a sufficient concentration.
On the other hand, the addition of PPase to the RCA reaction mixtures
converts PPi to phosphate (Pi) ions and inhibits the formation of
Mg2PPi precipitates. As a result, long DNA strands are
produced rather than DNA particles. The released Pi ions may also
be involved in the formation of magnesium hydrogen phosphate (MgHPi)
complexes, which are partially soluble in aqueous solution. In addition
to MgHPi, several ionic species and complexes, including free Mg ions,
PPi ions, MgPPi ions, MgHPPi ions, Mg2PPi, etc., may be present in the initial RCA reaction mixture or be produced
as the reaction proceeds.20 However, it
is important to note that when we added PPase we did not observe any
precipitates or particles remaining after the RCA reaction and several
washing steps, possibly due to the low amount of those complexes present
in reaction solution being below the solubility limit (data not shown).

We first prepared AmpDNA by performing RCA with the addition of
PPase and purification, as described above (see detailed experimental
procedures in the Materials and Methods).
In a typical nucleic acid amplification process using a DNA polymerase,
the precipitation of Mg2PPi gives rise to inhibition of
DNA synthesis by causing a gradual decrease in free Mg ions required
for DNAP activity in the reaction solution over time.21,22 Therefore, when PPase was added to the RCA reaction mixtures, the
production of DNA slightly increased due to the reduced amount of
PPi as compared to the RCA products without PPase (Figure S1). We then examined the structural nature of AmpDNA
by UV–vis absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
For comparison, we used phage lambda DNA (λ DNA), which is about
48.5 kb in length. The AmpDNA showed a single characteristic band
at 260 nm in a UV–vis spectrum, a negative peak at 245 nm,
and a positive peak at 280 nm in a CD spectrum, which are consistent
with spectra of double-stranded λ DNA (Figure S2a,b). Both DNA solutions have absorbance ratios of ca. 1.87
and ca. 1.85 at 260 nm/280 nm, suggesting that they are of suitable
purity for the next fabrication step. In the agarose gel electrophoresis
analysis, the AmpDNA appeared as a high-molecular-weight band (>35
kb), indicating that the RCA products were successfully synthesized.
To gain more insight into the structure, we visualized both DNAs prepared
on mica by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in tapping mode (Figure S2c,d). The AmpDNA showed high-order complex,
supercoiled, and elongated DNA strands with an average height of 0.47
± 0.03 nm. While the AmpDNA showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-like
features from the CD spectrum and AFM imaging similar to λ DNA,
it is well accepted that the RCA process robustly produces very long
and concatemeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) products, in which the
amplified DNA is continuously displaced from the cyclic template DNA
by a φ29 DNAP. These RCA products have been extensively exploited
as functional ssDNA units capable of binding to single-stranded oligonucleotides
or forming secondary structures such as DNA aptamers, DNAzymes, and
G-quadruplexes.23 To study the nature of
AmpDNA as RCA products, we performed thorough analysis of AmpDNA with
several exo- and endonucleases and SYBR dyes specific for ssDNA and/or
dsDNA cleavage and staining (see more details of experimental procedures
and analysis in the Supporting Information, Figure S3 and Table S2). We believe that the prepared AmpDNA as
single-stranded RCA products represent a mix of ssDNA and dsDNA but
most likely form a large amount of dsDNA-like conformations as a result
of random folding of very long, flexible ssDNA.

We investigated
the structure of a set of Mg2PPi/DNA
composites, where abundant PPi and Mg ions were precipitated in the
presence of AmpDNA or λ DNA in aqueous solution for 20 h by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Following the previous
studies, various concentrations of PPi (0.5, 1, and 2 mM) were precipitated
with a fixed amount of DNA (4 μg) in the same buffer used in
the RCA reaction. Parts a–c of Figure 1 show the influence of DNA molecules on the
formation of the composites. First, Mg2PPi without DNA
formed a random assembly comprising 1–2 μm sized ellipsoidal
nanoflakes in-plane. Some of these assembled into spherical or rodlike
irregular aggregates with an increase in Mg2PPi concentration.
In contrast, the inclusion of DNA led to the formation of relatively
small, fairly uniform spherical particles with multipetal flower-like
morphology similar to that of DNF. This also led to time-dependent
crystallization with changes in size and morphology (Figure S5). We further analyzed a single ellipsoidal nanoflake
by chemical mapping using a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
operating in scanning TEM (STEM) mode combined with energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Figure 1d). The STEM-EDS elemental maps confirmed the presence
of O, Mg, and P in the nanoflake consisting of Mg2PPi (or
Mg2P2O7).

nm. (E) Schematic illustration of the proposed role of DNA molecules
in the regulation of the anisotropic growth of the Mg2PPi
nanoflakes.

As schematically depicted
in Figure 1e, the presence
of DNA molecules seems to have a significant
effect on the formation of primary crystals and their growth. It is
likely that the nucleation and crystal growth of Mg2PPi
are retarded when the DNA molecules are present. This may be due to
the electrostatic and van der Waals dispersion interactions between
DNA and Mg2+ ions,24 effectively
increasing the nucleation energy of Mg2PPi while also reducing
the overall crystal growth rate, thus leading to much finer particles.
This observation is in line with biomineralization processes finely
regulated by naturally occurring organic macromolecules (e.g., complexes of nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, or lipids), which
are believed to participate actively in the nucleation and growth
processes.25−27 The location of such organics can alter morphologies,
structures, and orientations of the minerals via interactions
with ionic precursors or mineral phases. Therefore, it is of great
interest to understand how features such as size, morphology and crystal
lattice can be affected by the DNA additives, acting as growth inhibitors
and particle stabilizers during crystallization events.

We further
performed a closer examination of single particles using
both SEM and STEM. Using STEM, we can probe various aspects of a sample
by collecting in parallel some of the multiple signals arising from
interactions of the incident electron beam with a sample. Importantly,
collecting the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) signal in the
STEM produces an image where the image intensity (I) increases monotonically with specimen thickness and atomic number
(Z), where I ∼ Zα and α is a parameter between 1.6 and 2.28−30 The resulting HAADF-STEM image contrast is therefore often referred
to as “Z-contrast”: a higher or lower contrast indicates,
respectively, heavier (higher atomic number) or lighter elements (lower
atomic number) in the specimen, i.e., for a uniform
specimen thickness. As shown in Figure S6, the Mg2PPi particles possessed more hierarchical structures
with increasing concentrations of PPi ions, in which densely packed
backbones with bright image contrast indicate the materials with a
high elemental density, assumed to be inorganic materials comprising
O (Z = 8), Mg (Z = 12), and P (Z = 15).

Figure 2 shows high-resolution
secondary electron SE-SEM and HAADF-STEM images of an individual particle
of each formulation in conjunction with STEM–EDS analysis.
Here we should note that we sought to find a single particle in Mg2PPi with similar morphology to other composites for comparison,
although they typically form aggregates with random size and morphology.
As shown in Figure 2a, the Mg2PPi particle exhibited a well-defined flower-like
structure, consisting of several dozen nanoflakes with a smooth surface.
The DNA-incorporated Mg2PPi particles also exhibited similar
morphologies, but with more interconnected networks of nanoflakes,
presumably connected by long DNA strands, as indicated by red arrows
in the magnified views (Figure 2b–d). This is in good agreement with the HAADF-STEM
images in Figure 2e–h.
Notably, the observed inorganic backbones of the Mg2PPi/DNA
composites were nearly all curved with very few straight lines compared
to Mg2PPi alone, implying that the adsorption of DNA led
to anisotropic inhibition of the growth of the inorganic phases. EDS
spectra were obtained from the entire region of an individual particle
of each sample and revealed that C, N, O, Mg, and P are the main elements
present in all Mg2PPi/DNA composites (Figure 2i). The obtained EDS spectra
were quantitatively analyzed with the Inca software that uses calculated
k-factors based on uniform composition and thickness of the specimen.
Based on this quantitative analysis, the relative atomic ratios of
C/Mg, N/Mg, and O/Mg in Mg2PPi/AmpDNA, Mg2PPi/λ
DNA, and DNF were higher than those in Mg2PPi. However,
their P/Mg ratios remained nearly the same, indicative of the incorporation
of DNA within the particles (Figure 2j). We further confirmed the incorporation of DNA by
performing AFM-based indentation experiments, showing a slightly decreased
Young’s modulus of ca. 3.5 ± 0.6, 6.0 ± 0.8, and
6.2 ± 0.5 MPa for Mg2PPi/AmpDNA, Mg2PPi/λ
DNA, and DNF compared to bare Mg2PPi particles (ca. 7.8
± 2.0 MPa); thus, Mg2PPi crystals became slightly
less stiff when DNA strands were present (not statistically significant).

(not significant, p > 0.05) and *p < 0.001 based on one-way ANOVA and Tukey test’s multiple
comparison.

We also investigated
the effect of AmpDNA concentration on composite
formation. The particle size gradually decreased with increasing AmpDNA
concentration, forming relatively small particles of 500–600
nm in size for an AmpDNA concentration of 53 μg mL–1 (Figure S7). Experimentally, the addition
of a higher concentration of AmpDNA (>53 μg mL–1) slowed the nucleation and inhibited the growth of the Mg2PPi crystals such that any visible precipitates were not obtained
after several washing steps. Therefore, these results suggest that
the presence of DNA is of great importance for the spatial arrangement
of inorganic Mg2PPi backbones in the structure and affects
the particle size and distribution through strong association with
Mg2PPi crystals. The length and structures of AmpDNA may
also affect the crystallization of Mg2PPi since a DNA molecule
carries different numbers of charged phosphate groups depending on
size or along the ssDNA or dsDNA chain,31 which could influence the charge balance toward Mg2+.
A more comprehensive understanding of the effect of AmpDNA with varying
sizes on Mg2PPi formation could be achieved by tuning the
RCA reaction time to produce smaller sized DNA products or by using
other types of DNA, e.g., PCR products and short
DNA oligonucleotides, smaller than AmpDNA in length. The structures
of AmpDNA could be potentially modulated using ssDNA-binding (SSB)
proteins (e.g., T4 gene 32 protein, E. coli. SSB), which are known to stabilize ssDNA regions in a cooperative
way and to enhance specific activity and yield of DNAP in DNA amplification
applications.32 When introducing phage
M13mp18 ssDNA as a control DNA, we observed that long ssDNA was effectively
condensed with Mg2PPi, leading to the formation of particles
resembling Mg2PPi/λ DNA composites (Figure S8).

In addition to DNA, we further crystallized
Mg2PPi in
the presence of proteins with another organic additive, here RNase
A (200 μg mL–1), with or without AmpDNA (termed
Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R or Mg2PPi-R), and conducted
identical analysis by STEM imaging and STEM-EDS. The protein additive
yielded a similar particle morphology and configuration of the inorganic
material as Mg2PPi and similarly exhibited more curved
morphology of the inorganic backbone with the inclusion of DNA and
enzymes (Figure 3a–c).
The EDS data indicate that all enzyme-containing composites have slightly
increased O/Mg atomic ratios compared to the composites without the
additional inclusion of enzymes (Figure 3d,e).

A direct observation of the spatial distribution
of carbon and
nitrogen provides a clear indication of organic materials such as
DNA within the Mg2PPi/DNA composites. The chemical bonding
analysis of these two elements may offer some useful information on
the molecular relationship between DNA and Mg2PPi matrix
at the nanoscale. Although we observed the presence of both elements
in all DNA-incorporated composites from the EDS analysis, mapping
the elemental distribution within the particles with EDS is hampered
by the technique’s relatively low sensitivity to lighter elements
such as C, N, and O.33 In contrast, electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) provides a higher sensitivity for
lighter elements in combination with a much higher energy resolution,
as compared to EDS.34,35 The higher energy resolution
allows not only for elemental mapping but also for resolving spectral
features in EELS ionization edges that can be attributed to specific
chemical bonding states of the probed material down to atomic spatial
resolution36,37 and even of single atom defects.38 Therefore, to systematically study the localization
of organics and their chemical bonding arrangements within the composites,
we used EELS in a TEM (operating in STEM mode) on DNA, enzyme-embedded
Mg2PPi composites (Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R) and DNF-R.

For the EELS analysis, we prepared a site-specific lamellar sample
with a thickness of 80–100 nm using the focused ion beam (FIB)
lift-out technique (Figure S9).39,40 For EELS acquisition, we cooled down the sample to cryo-temperature
(−180 °C) inside the TEM using liquid nitrogen. Following
this, we obtained the EEL spectral maps using raster scans with a
18–20 nm pixel size and denoised them using the principal component
analysis (PCA) to enhance weak signals in the spectrum (see detailed
procedures in the Materials and Methods). Figures 4 and S10 show the STEM and EELS characterization of
the sliced sections of Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R and DNF-R prepared
by FIB. Maps of C, N, and O for both composites were generated from
the corresponding absorption K-edges of C, N, and
O in the EEL spectrum, which suggests that all elements of interest
are present over the selected areas of the particles (Figure 4b,g).

spectra recorded over an area of 5 × 5 pixels or 4 × 4 pixels
from the regions numbered 1–6, as marked in (A) and (F). (D,
I) Average C K-edge EELS spectra fitted with Gaussian
peaks. Peaks A (284–285 eV), B (286–287 eV), and C (289–290
eV) were assigned to aromatic carbon (aromatic C), organic carbon
(organic C), and carbonate bonding, respectively. (E, J) The ratio
maps of peak B, i.e., (organic C)/total intensity,
and peak C, i.e., (carbonate)/total intensity, show
the relative contribution of organic carbon and carbonate bonding
within the particle. Ratio maps were generated by dividing intensity
maps of peak B (organic C) and C (carbonate), resulting from Gaussian
fitting of C K-edges in (D) and (I), by the respective
total C K-edge intensities (integrated over 15 eV
windows from the edge onsets).

The study of C and N K-edges was of particular
interest to identify differences in specific chemical compositions
between the two composites. Therefore, we first analyzed the fine
structure of the C K-edge in various selected regions
from the edge to center of the Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R using Gaussian
peak fitting. We assigned three peaks to three different atomic configurations:
peak A at ∼285 eV assigned to 1s−π* transitions
in aromatic carbon bonds, peak B between 286 and 288 eV attributable
to 1s−π* transitions in organic carbon bonds (e.g., carbonly carbon groups in aromatic rings, aromatic
carbon bonds attached to amide groups, carbonyl and pyrimidine carbon
bonds, etc.), possibly from nucleic acids and proteins,
and peak C at ∼290 eV mainly corresponding to 1s−π*
transitions in carbonate (Figure 4c,d).41−45 Specifically, the carbonate signal (peak C) was more pronounced
in the center (EELS point 6 compared to point 1 in Figure 4a), while the organic carbon
feature (peak B) was evenly preserved over the selected area of the
particle. We observed the N K-edge at ∼399
eV (peak D), most likely assigned to the 1s−π* transitions
for nitrogen in an aromatic ring such as pyridine or amide group.43−45 However, as the intensity of N K-edge was weak
due to low signal-to-noise, we could not resolve the fine structure
of the N K-edge.

The K-edges
of carbon and nitrogen in the DNF-R
were relatively similar in their dominant functional groups: particularly
in the C K-edge, aromatic carbon bonds at ∼284
eV (peak A), organic carbon bonds between 286 and 288 eV (peak B),
and carbonate at ∼289 eV (peak C) (Figure 4h,i). We also obtained a reference spectrum
from the platinum-covered region to evaluate if the observed peak
features could be attributed to contamination during the sample preparation
procedure (Figure S11). The C K-edge from the platinum-covered region showed a significant increase
in the contribution of spectral features consistent with the ∼285
eV 1s−π* and ∼292 eV 1s−σ* peaks
of amorphous and graphitic carbons,46 rather
than an increase in the relative contribution of peaks B and C. This
confirmed that the B and C peaks are associated with organic and carbonate
bonding inside the particle, rather than any superimposed carbon originating
from the platinum deposition. Moreover, as indicated by the ratio
maps of peaks B and C to the total C K-edge intensity,
both composites showed a relatively higher content of organic carbon
bonding (peak B) at the edge of the particles compared to the central
region, implying that organic materials such as DNA and enzymes are
more likely to be localized on the periphery of the particles (Figure 4e,j).

The synthetic
DNA-driven crystallization method provides a significant
advantage for effective encapsulation of proteins of interest while
not recruiting other enzymes (such as φ29 DNAP, DNA ligase,
and exonuclease) involved in the entire process of RCA-based DNF formulation.
In this regard, we also speculated that the coincident participation
of multiple proteins along with gradual elongation of DNA and production
of Mg2PPi during RCA might give rise to a relatively lower
level of DNA inclusion than the Mg2PPi/DNA composites prepared
by the coprecipitation route. To assess whether DNA molecules can
alter the ordering of the Mg2PPi crystals by adhering to
growing faces in different ways, the crystals grown in the absence
or presence of DNA and/or enzymes were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD). The diffraction patterns of the composites clearly indicate
that they exist in the phase of a hydrated magnesium pyrophosphate
(Mg2P2O7·3.5H2O).47 There are no pronounced shifts in the peak positions
measured for either Mg2PPi/DNA composites or DNF regardless
of enzyme inclusion, as compared with pure Mg2PPi (Figure 5a). However, when
DNA is introduced, they display peak broadening which spans the whole
spectrum to some degree, ascribed to the inhomogeneous strain field
caused by organic macromolecules as large entities within crystalline
lattices, as reported in the literature.48

and DNF-R). A diffraction pattern of the simulated Mg2PPi
(Mg2P2O7·3.5H2O)

power of 30 mW and acquisition time of 20 s and show the spectra of
one point in the sample area. All Raman spectra are normalized to
the area under the curve. (D) UV absorption and (E) CD spectra of

systems. The concentration of RNA substrate was 4 μM. (G)
Reaction rate against various concentrations of the substrate (0.1–8
μM) for four catalytic systems. The concentration of RNase A
in each sample was 0.5 ng mL–1. Results represent
mean ± s.d. for four independent experiments.

In order to ascertain how these DNA molecules are
arranged in crystals,
we further analyzed several Mg2PPi composites formed by
two approaches and showed their Raman spectra of the 600–1800
cm–1 region with most prominent bands and their
assignment (Figure 5b,c, Tables S4 and S5). Raman spectra
provide clear evidence, in both types of composites (Mg2PPi/AmpDNA and DNF), of the inclusion of DNA from the peaks in the
1100–1700 cm–1 region predominantly originating
from in-plane C–C, C–N, C=N bond stretching or
bending vibrations of nucleobases (Figure 5b).49−51 In contrast, RNase entrapment
into the composites displayed no appreciable peak changes compared
to those without RNase A. When DNA is incorporated into Mg2PPi, the characteristic DNA shoulder peak at ∼784 cm–1 appears, attributed to the νs(OPO) vibration of
DNA, whereas the peak at 762 cm–1 characteristic
of the νs(POP) vibration of PPi appears in all spectra.
The νs(PO2) tentatively assigned to the
vibration band of DNA, normally at 1090 cm–1, is
obscured by the strong νs(PO2) vibration
of PPi at 1063 cm–1 (Figure S13 and S14). The intensity ratio I784/I762 or I784/I1063, which is indicative of the degree
of covalency of the C–O–P–O–C bond of
DNA phosphodiester backbones,51 increased
in DNA-incorporated composites compared to Mg2PPi and showed
a ca. 1.6–1.8-fold higher level for Mg2PPi/AmpDNA
than for DNF (Figure S15a). This result
implies that the synthetic DNA-directed crystallization approach gave
rise to a relatively higher level of the O–P–O environments
of DNA in the composites, compared to those synthesized via a RCA-based one-pot process.

The phosphate (PO2) region of the spectrum centered
at 1063 cm–1 contains more information about the
effect of DNA on the structure of these Mg2PPi composites.
The full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the phosphate band, which
can be related to phase crystallinity,52 further indicates that DNF exhibits a broader fwhm than Mg2PPi or Mg2PPi/AmpDNA (Figure S15b). This suggests a lower crystallinity of the Mg2PPi phase
caused by impeded packing and organization of the crystals through
interactions with DNA and proteins. This is consistent with XRD profiles
observed in DNF and DNF-R, which may also point to a decrease of the
interchain strength of crystals experienced by the adsorption of DNA
and reaction proteins during the RCA process. This protein association
during RCA is further supported by three intense peaks strikingly
appearing at 852, 919, and 1468 cm–1 in the Raman
spectra of DNA and DNF-R, which can be considered as protein peaks.53,54 More interestingly, these peaks nearly disappear when in aqueous
solution (Figure 5c).
Instead, an appearance of the broad peak around 832–835 cm–1, which is characteristic of B-DNA conformation,51 was detected in DNA-containing Mg2PPi composites. As noted in Figures 5c and S13b, this peak originated
from the νs(OPO) vibration of the polyphosphodiester
bonds in DNA and was not clearly detected in the air-dried samples
due to the conformational transition of some of the DNA from physiological
B-DNA to dehydrated A-form DNA.55

The UV absorption and CD spectra in aqueous solution similarly
reveal the DNA–Mg2PPi interaction. In Figure 5d,e, all composites except
for Mg2PPi showed a maximum in absorbance near 260 nm and
a positive band at ∼280 nm and a negative band at ∼250
nm in CD signals, indicating that the secondary structure of DNA is
maintained in the B-form even after condensation with Mg2PPi.56 However, we also note that Mg2PPi/AmpDNA and Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R displayed a positive
signal at 283 nm and a negative signal at 255 nm in the CD spectra,
which are slightly red-shifted in comparison to the peaks observed
for free AmpDNA, DNF, and DNF-R. This shift is therefore likely caused
by alterations in helical arrangements and the asymmetric phosphate
backbone of DNA, known to be induced by strong interactions with other
molecules,57 and here by Mg2PPi, where we observed similar phenomena in their Raman spectra.

Finally, we investigated the catalytic activity of the RNase A
embedded in Mg2PPi/AmpDNA by monitoring the fluorescence
of an RNA substrate labeled with a dye and quencher at the ends. The
activity of free enzyme, Mg2PPi-R, and DNF-R was also studied
for comparison (Figure 5f,g). Interestingly, the enzyme encapsulation in Mg2PPi/AmpDNA
was almost as effective in overall activity as free enzyme, while
the enzyme within Mg2PPi or DNF exhibited ca. 2-fold lower
activity at 20 min (Figure 5f). Based on the initial rate (the maximum slope, dΔF/dt) at various substrate concentrations
(0.1–8 μM), we further calculated the Km and Vmax (kinetic parameters
obtained from the Michaelis–Menten plot in Figure 5g) for each formulation. As
reported in Table S6, the incorporated
enzyme within the three composites gave negligible changes in the Km, while only Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R showed
a comparable Vmax to free enzyme. This
reveals that the DNA-mediated crystallization method leads to a more
active catalyst than RCA-driven in situ synthesis,
which accompanies other proteins and carryover reaction components.
Moreover, Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R yielded a ca. 5-fold higher Vmax than that in Mg2PPi-R, consistent
with the previous findings that highly ordered and hydrogen-bonded
water environments of DNA structures in combination with high charge
density are responsible for the enhancement of enzyme activity.58 Although the RCA-based one-pot approach provides
experimental simplicity for enzyme encapsulation, it contains various
possibilities of thermal, chemical, and/or physical denaturation of
the embedded enzyme due to the reaction conditions (temperature, reaction
buffers, other reaction enzymes) required for typical nucleic acid
amplification techniques. Therefore, the synthetic DNA-driven crystallization
method offers distinct advantages, namely enabling encapsulation of
a diverse range of enzymes, favorable reaction conditions (room temperature
and neutral pH), and no nonselective association of other molecules.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrate an approach for controlling the size,
structure, and properties of Mg2PPi crystals with well
incorporated synthetic DNA molecules. In combination with our previous
study on the fabrication of well-defined hybrid structures of Mg2PPi/DNA composites through a one-pot enzymatic synthesis,
we have shown that these composites can be formulated by precipitating
abundant Mg and PPi ions with effectively isolated DNA, here AmpDNA,
without association of nonselective adsorption of various proteins
that can stem from the RCA reaction. As one of the key findings of
our study, we report the influences of the inclusion of DNA as a macromolecular
additive on the nucleation and growth kinetics, thereby controlling
morphology and size of Mg2PPi crystals. The DNA inclusion
gave rise to the formation of relatively uniform, spherical Mg2PPi/DNA particles with a more curved arrangement of inorganic
phases, whereas Mg2PPi without DNA led to a random assembly
of crystals with irregular size and morphology. From the diverse spectroscopic
characterizations, we also found that Mg2PPi crystallization
in the presence of DNA via the coprecipitation method
led to the relatively higher crystallinity coupled with strong interaction
with DNA compared to the RCA-based one-pot process. This denotes an
alternative approach for RCA-driven protein encapsulation that is
subjected to specific reaction conditions, such as temperature and
reaction components, required for DNAP activity. Thus, our developed
approach can be further extended to build protein-embedded DNA architectures
using broad reaction conditions while taking advantage of the hydrated
polymer-like DNA chains, demonstrating its potential as a biocatalytic
enzyme complex. This approach exhibits great potential for even further
biomedical applications, due to the ability to encapsulate a variety
of biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA.

Materials
and Methods
Preparation of AmpDNA
High-performance liquid chromatography
purified DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technology, USA) were
used without further purification (see Table S1 for details of DNA sequences). All enzymes and reagents used in
rolling circle amplification (RCA) were obtained from New England
Biolabs (USA). The amplified DNA (AmpDNA) was synthesized by carrying
out the RCA reaction in the presence of pyrophosphatase (PPase) and
subsequent purification with ethanol precipitation. To serve as a
template for a typical RCA process, single-stranded DNA minicircles
were first prepared by ligation of linear template DNA with T4 DNA
ligase. Briefly, 5′-phosphorylated linear DNA (5 μM)
was hybridized with a primer (10 μM) in ligase reaction buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, pH 7.5)
by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature
over 3 h. The nick in the hybridized DNA was chemically sealed by
incubation with T4 DNA ligase (20 U μL–1)
in a reaction volume of 100 μL at 16 °C overnight. After
heat inactivation of the enzyme at 65 °C for 10 min, to degrade
excess primers the resulting mixture was further treated with exonuclease
I (480 mU μL–1) in reaction buffer (67 mM
glycine–KOH, 6.7 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
pH 9.5) at 37 °C for 1.5 h (final volume of 250 μL). The
enzyme was inactivated at 80 °C for 15 min. The resulting template
DNA minicircle (2 μM) containing T4 DNA ligase (8 U μL–1) and exonuclease I (480 mU μL–1) was used for RCA reaction without further purification.

For
synthesis of AmpDNA, a typical RCA mixture in a final volume of 50
μL containing a DNA minicircle (0.6 μM), dNTPs (1 mM),
phi29 DNA polymerase (φ29 DNAP, 1 U μL–1), and PPase (2 mU μL–1) was prepared in
reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4 mM DTT, pH 7.5). The reaction
was performed at 30 °C for 20 h and terminated by inactivation
of the DNAP at 65 °C for 10 min. It is important to note that
relatively large amounts of DNA ligase (120 U, 2.4 U μL–1) and exonuclease I (7 U, 144 mU μL–1) still remained along with 50 U of DNAP (1 U μL–1) in 50 μL of RCA products. The RCA products were desalted
and precipitated by ammonium acetate (2.5 M) and ethanol. The DNA
pellet was dissolved in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), fully unfolded
by heating at 95 °C for 10 min, quenched on ice, and stored at
−20 °C for further use.

Here the obtained AmpDNA
is highly likely to contain both single-stranded
(ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). However, it is not practically
straightforward to quantify the exact amount of each ssDNA and dsDNA
present in AmpDNA as currently available DNA quantification methods
detect both DNA strands to some extent. Based on the results in Figure S3, we assumed that the amount of ssDNA
in AmpDNA could be negligible, and therefore used the PicoGreen dsDNA
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) for quantification. The fluorescence-based
PicoGreen measurement enables the measurement of the concentration
of dsDNA with varying fragment sizes and molecular complexity with
reliable sensitivity and efficiency as compared with the UV absorbance-based
method.59 The DNA concentration was then
determined according to the manufacturer’s protocols, based
on the standard curve of serial dilutions of lambda DNA (λ DNA).
The average repeating units in the resulting AmpDNA were estimated
by following the previously reported methods (see detailed experimental
procedures and analysis in Figure S4 and Table S3 in Supporting Information).17,60 The pyrophosphate
(PPi) concentration was assessed using the pyrophosphate assay kit
(Abcam, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
obtained values were inverted to PPi concentration using appropriate
PPi standards.

Growth of Mg2PPi in the Presence
of AmpDNA and RNase
A
To formulate Mg2PPi/AmpDNA and Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R, magnesium pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi or Mg2P2O7) with varying concentrations (0.5–2
mM) was precipitated in the presence of AmpDNA (26.7 μg mL–1) and/or RNase A (200 μg mL–1). A stock solution of sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate (Na4P2O7·10H2O, 20 mM, Sigma-Aldrich)
dissolved in nuclease-free water was added to a solution of AmpDNA
and/or RNase A in the RCA reaction buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2. Precipitation was allowed to proceed at 30 °C. After
20 h, white precipitates were visible and washed with nuclease-free
water by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min. The
obtained particles were redispersed in nuclease-free water and kept
at 4 °C until use. For comparison, Mg2PPi/λ
DNA and Mg2PPi/M13mp18 ssDNA were was also formed by precipitating
Mg2PPi in the presence of commercial lambda DNA (λ
DNA, 26.7 and 40 μg mL–1) and M13mp18 ssDNA
(26.7 and 40 μg mL–1) obtained from New England
Biolabs.

Synthesis of DNF and DNF-R
DNA flowers (DNF) and RNase
A-entrapped DNF (DNF-R) were prepared using the one-pot process of
RCA, as described in our previous work.8 For DNF-R, RNase A (600 μg mL–1) was additionally
added to the RCA reaction mixture in a final volume of 50 μL
consisting of a DNA minicircle (0.6 μM), dNTPs (1 mM), and φ29
DNAP (1 U μL–1) in the RCA reaction buffer.
The RCA was carried out at 30 °C for 20 h, which is the same
condition with the fabrication of Mg2PPi/DNA composites
and further incubated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate DNAP.
The DNF and DNF-R were then collected by centrifugal separation and
washing of the RCA products with nuclease-free water and stored at
4 °C.

SEM Imaging
For scanning electron
microscopy (SEM)
imaging, 2.5 μL of each sample solution in nuclease-free water
was placed on a cleaned silicon wafer chip (about 5 mm × 5 mm)
and air-dried at room temperature, followed by coating with 10 nm
chromium in a Q150T S sputter coater (Quorum Technologies). SEM analysis
was performed on a Leo Gemini 1525 FEG SEM equipped with a secondary
electron in-lens detector operating at 5 kV.

Sample Preparation for
TEM/STEM and EELS Analysis
The
samples for TEM/STEM and EELS were prepared using a dual beam focused
ion beam (FIB, FEI Helios NanoLab 600) (Figure S9). Briefly, a region of 14 μm × 2 μm with
particles of interest was selected in SEM mode and coated with 1 μm
electron deposited platinum at 5 kV. The region was further protected
by 1 μm platinum deposited by ion beam operating at 93 pA, 30
kV. Two trenches of dimensions 18 μm × 4 μm ×
4 μm (length × width × depth) were made on either
side of platinum protected layer using 2.8 nA to 6.4 nA at 30 kV.
The section was further thinned to 1 μm and then released from
the base using 6.4 nA, 30 kV. The released sample was then lifted
out using omniprobe manipulator and secured to a TEM lift-out 3 post
copper grid (Agar Scientific) using platinum (1 μm thick). The
sample section was further thinned down to approximately 80–100
nm thickness using currents in between 0.46 nA and 2.8 nA, 30 kV.
Finally, the surface of the sample was cleaned and polished using
ion beam operated at 10 pA, 2 kV to remove possible artifacts introduced
by the ion milling.

STEM Imaging and EDS Analysis
The
samples were prepared
by placing 10 μL of the sample solution on 200-mesh carbon-coated
Cu grids (Electron Microscopy Science, USA). Imaging in scanning transmission
microscopy (STEM) mode and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
analysis were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM operating at 200 kV,
equipped with Gatan Orius SC 1000 (2 k × 4 k), Gatan high-angle
annular dark-field (HAADF), Gatan annular bright field (BF), and EDS
detectors (Oxford Instruments INCA EDS 80 mm X-Max detector system
with STEM capability). The EDS spectra from the whole area of the
individual particles were taken. Measurements over five particles
per sample were used for elemental analysis. The obtained EDS spectra
were quantitatively analyzed with a standardless approach and k-factors provided by the Inca software (Oxford Instruments).

EELS Acquisition and Analysis
For EELS acquisition,
the FIB prepared sample was cooled down to cryo-temperature (−180
°C) using liquid nitrogen in the cryo-sample holder inside the
TEM. The EELS was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM in STEM mode at
200 kV, equipped with STEM detectors (HAADF/BF), Gatan Quantum SE
energy filter, and Gatan Orius SC 1000 (2 k × 4 k) camera. The
spectral maps were collected with an energy resolution of ∼1
eV and using a dispersion of 0.25 eV/channel. The exposure time was
set to 0.5–1.0 s, and spectra were acquired every 18–20
nm following 2D raster scans. The spatial drift was corrected in parallel,
and high quality (HQ) dark correction was applied following the acquisition
of EEL spectrum images.

For EELS analysis, principal component
analysis (PCA) based denoising was performed as implemented in the
Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MSA) plugin for Gatan’s
DigitalMicrograph software 1.8 (commercially available from HREM Research
Inc.). The 25 or 13 most significant components were included for
reconstruction of the data sets used for the EELS analysis of Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R and DNF-R, respectively. The spectral maps were
calibrated using the O K-edge at 536 eV. A power
law background subtraction with a 10–20 eV window or wider
was performed on all acquired edges. For carbon K- (C K-), nitrogen K- (N K-), and oxygen K- (O K-) edges, the fitting windows were set at 265–282, 379–394,
and 509–525 eV, respectively. To obtain elemental maps, the
C, N, and O signals are integrated over the following energy windows:
284–291 eV (C K), 397–402 eV (N K), and 528–544 eV (O K). To quantify
spectral peak properties, the C K-edge was fitted
with Gaussian functions using the nonlinear least-squares (NLLS) fitting
tool available within DigitalMicrograph software 1.8 and subsequently
plotted using SigmaPlot 12.0 (Systat Software Inc.). Ratio maps where
created by dividing intensity maps of peaks B and C (resulting from
the Gaussian fitting of the data set, using peaks centered at 284–285
(A), 286–287 (B), and 289–290 eV (C)) by the total C K-edge intensity integrated over a 15 eV window from the
edge onset (at 283 eV for Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R and at 281 eV
for DNF-R). The peaks were assigned using the available XANES and
EELS literature.44,45,61−64

XRD Measurements
For X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements,
the sample films on an oxygen plasma-treated silicon wafer chip (about
1 cm × 1 cm) were prepared by evaporation of aqueous sample solution
in air. Diffraction patterns of the sample films were recorded on
a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD (PANalytical, The Netherlands)
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA).
The data were collected at angles from 5° to 60° with a
step size of 0.03°, and a scan rate of 2° min–1. The obtained results were analyzed using X’Pert HighScore
Plus software.

Raman Spectroscopy Analysis
The
sample solution dispersed
in nuclease-free water was dropped onto a cleaned calcium fluoride
Raman substrate (Crystran Ltd., UK) and air-dried overnight. For comparison,
a droplet of the sample solution was placed on the substrate just
before Raman measurements. Analysis was performed on a confocal Raman
microspectroscopy system (alpha 300 R+, WITec GmbH, Germany) using
a green laser (λex = 532 nm) with maximum output
of 75 mW and a × 20/0.4 NA microscope objective lens (EC Epiplan,
Zeiss, Germany). The backscattered Raman signals were directed to
the spectrometer using a 100 μm low OH silicon fiber, equipped
with a thermoelectrically cooled, charge-coupled device camera (Newton,
Andor Technology Ltd., UK). Raman spectra were collected in the spectral
range from 0 to 3,600 cm–1 under a laser power of
∼13 mW with an acquisition time of 5 s (for solid samples)
and ∼30 mW with an acquisition time of 20 s (for liquid samples).

Raman data were processed using in-house written methods using
MATLAB software (MathWorks Inc., USA). The data were first smoothed
using the second-order Savitsky-Golay method with a window size of
9. For the baseline correction, a second-order polynomial was fitted
to the smoothed spectrum in the range of 600–1800 cm–1 and subtracted. All of the spectra presented were subsequently normalized
to the area under the curve, which removed any instrument effects
and enabled comparisons between the samples by reducing the signal
intensity variability. To determine the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm), the peak centered at 1063 cm–1 in the 1020–1110
cm–1 spectral region was fit to a Gaussian profile
using OriginPro 9.1 software. The peaks were assigned according to
the literature data.49−51,53−55

UV Absorption and CD Measurements
The samples were
redispersed in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The UV absorption and circular
dichroism (CD) signals were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 UV/vis
spectrometer in a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette and JASCO J-715 spectrometer
in a 0.1 cm quartz cuvette, respectively. The CD data were collected
at room temperature with two scan accumulations at a scan rate of
50 nm min–1 with a 0.1 nm pitch and 4 s integration
time.

RNase Activity Test
The ribonucleotic activity of RNase
A was evaluated using a synthetic RNA oligonucleotide, which has a
fluorescein dye and quencher at both ends (RNase Alert substrate,
Integrated DNA Technology). Before testing, the protein concentration
of each sample was measured by Qubit protein reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), based on the standard curve using free RNase A with known
concentrations (0, 200, and 400 ng μL–1).
Protein-containing sample solution (10 μL) was mixed with 190
μL of Qubit working solution prepared by diluting 200-fold the
Qubit protein reagent in assay buffer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the
fluorescence was measured with the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. The amount
of encapsulated RNase A in DNF-R was calculated by subtracting the
measured concentration in DNF as a blank sample (which possibly entraps
other proteins such as DNAP, ligase, or exonuclease) from that in
DNF-R. Given that there are no proteins associated during particle
formation, the measured concentrations of Mg2PPi-R and
Mg2PPi/AmpDNA-R were used without subtraction of a blank
sample, here, Mg2PPi. RNase activity assays were performed
at room temperature by adding 10 μL of the RNase Alert substrate
with an increasing concentration (0.1–8 μM) to 90 μL
of each sample with an enzyme concentration of 0.5 ng mL–1. Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) was used as an assay buffer. The fluorescence
intensity at an excitation of 490 nm and an emission of 520 nm was
monitored for 30 min using the EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer,
USA). The Km and Vmax were extracted from the Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk
plots (Figure 5g and S16), based on the following equation: 1/V =
(Km/Vmax)
× [S] + 1/Vmax, where V is the initial catalytic rate, Km is
the Michaelis–Menten constant, Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate, and [S] is the substrate concentration.
The initial rate of the enzyme was obtained by measuring a change
in fluorescence intensity of the sample and substrate over time, as
shown in Figure 5f.
