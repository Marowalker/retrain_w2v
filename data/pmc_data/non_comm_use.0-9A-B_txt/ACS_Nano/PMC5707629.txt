Biconcave thin water
layers represent a template to induce organization
of supramolecular structures into ordered monolayers. Here we show
how micelles form extensive micrometer-sized pseudo-2D superstructures
that reveal size-sorting and geometric pattern formation, as shown
by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM). Electron-rich
gold particles inside the micelles facilitate direct visualization
and determination of size, composition, and ordering of the micellar
assemblies over multiple length scales. Some of the patterns observed
show intriguing geometric patterns for superstructures, including
Fibonacci-like, double-spiral domains that also appear in, for example,
sunflower seed head patterns.

==== Body
The enigmatic
symmetry and ordering
observed in biological systems has raised wonder and interest since
mankind started observing nature, as described first in great detail
by D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 in his seminal book On Growth
and Form.1 Order plays an important
role at extreme length scales, also in nonbiological systems, from
atomic ordering in crystals to spiral structures in galaxies light
years in diameter.2,3 Organization is also at the heart
of sciences at the nanoscale, such as self-assembly of (macro)molecules
and nanoparticles, where specific supramolecular interactions can
generate complex yet discrete superstructures.3−9 However, it is still a great challenge to control and investigate
composition and ordering of hierarchically built-up systems over multiple
length scales; micelles provide a versatile tool for such investigation.

Coacervate core micelles are nanoassemblies in which oppositely
charged polymeric building blocks form the micelle core and neutral
polymer blocks constitute the micelle corona. Many micelle building
blocks have been reported, including proteins and dendrimers.10,11 Dendrimers are well-defined hyperbranched macromolecules with the
potential to encapsulate molecules or nanoparticles, with polyamidoamine
(PAMAM) dendrimers being among the most studied.12,13 In the past, we showed that carboxyl-terminated, negatively charged,
PAMAM dendrimers are versatile and robust micellar building blocks,14 and more recently we showed that amine-terminated,
positively charged PAMAM dendrimers also form well-defined dendrimicelles
through coacervation with charged block copolymers.15 In PAMAM dendrimers small nanoparticles can be encapsulated,16−18 which we managed to incorporate into dendrimicelles. The electron-rich,
nanometer-sized, gold nanoparticles in the core of these micelles
permit direct visualization and determination of size and composition
of the 50-nm-sized nanoassemblies, by cryoTEM. We here present detailed
cryoTEM analysis in which the micelles form extensive, ordered monolayer
superstructures in the biconcave thin water layer.

Figure 1 shows this
4-fold organization of our dendrimicelle system, where nanometer-sized
particles, templated in and residing inside dendrimers and assembled
in micellar core structures, organize into well-defined micrometer-sized
superstructures in biconcave thin water films. As dendrimers can be
considered molecular boxes and micelles as nanoboxes, we coined the
composite structure a [particle-in-a-box]-in-a-box nanostructure,
reflecting back on the two separate levels of hierarchy of encapsulation.
The first level concerns the nanoparticle encapsulation inside the
dendrimer box, and the second level the encapsulation (of many of
these dendrimer boxes) inside the micelle box. Our strategy allows
for the straightforward variation of subcomponents, to tune size and
polydispersity of the micelles. We here present superstructures from
micelles obtained with three different generations of dendrimers and
with two different subcomponent ratios to vary polydispersity. The
use of the nanoparticles residing at the inside of one of the assembled
components reveals composition, ordering, and patterns over multiple
length scales. These superstructures reveal size sorting of the micelles
within the superstructures and the formation of geometric patterns,
including Fibonacci-like double-spiral domains resembling those that
appear in, for example, sunflower seed heads and pine cones.1,2,19,20 As the ordering in natural systems is called phyllotaxis, we coin
the ordering of nanoparticles at the (sub)micrometer scale nanotaxis.

Results and Discussion
Dendrimer-encapsulated
gold nanoparticles, Au-DENs, were synthesized
following the original work of Amis by reduction of gold(III) ions
residing inside PAMAM dendrimers16,21 and as reported
for generation 7 dendrimers elsewhere.15 We focused on generations 7, 8, and 9 in order to have single particles
of respectively Au256, Au512, and Au1024 per dendrimer and aggregation numbers in the dendrimicelles between
10 and 40, to allow straightforward discrimination and counting of
individual nanoparticles. TEM analysis showed the formed Au-DENs to
be about 2–3 nm in diameter, with the PAMAM ranging in hydrodynamic
diameter (dynamic light scattering, DLS) from 9.6 to 17 nm for generation
7 to 9 (Figure S1). Consecutive mixing
under charge stoichiometry conditions (Figure S2) of the Au-DENs with a pMAA64-b-PEO885 block copolymer, consisting of a 64-subunit polymethacrylic
acid block and an 885-subunit poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) neutral block,
resulted in coacervate-core micelle formation as proven by DLS.

The cryoTEM micrographs (Figure 1) of a sample obtained from generation 8 Au-DENs clearly
corroborate formation of dendrimicelles, with a core size of about
25 nm as deduced from the gold particles delineating the core; the
PEO corona is not observed, but its size can be deduced from the intercore
distances to be about 7 nm. The average micelle diameter of about
40 nm, as determined from TEM, is slightly smaller than the about
50 nm hydrodynamic diameter obtained from DLS, which could indicate
the PEO chains to be compressed or even interpenetrating with neighboring
micelles upon packing in the superstructure.22 Counting the Au-DENs per micelle core allows a straightforward determination
of the aggregation number of the components and hence the size of
the whole micelle. For the system shown in Figure 1, on average 27 Au-DENs reside inside a micelle,
corresponding to 27 PAMAM dendrimers and about 400 block copolymers
at charge stoichiometric mixing conditions. The total molecular dry
weight of such micelles is therefore on the order of about 25 MDa.
We note that cryoTEM micrographs are the 2D representation (image)
of the 3D system (the micelle), and therefore, particles that are
overlapping in the micelle shown in Figure 1f are not fused; they just have the same x,y-coordinates but are separated along
the z-axis. The packing fraction of the DENs in the
dendrimicelle core is ∼0.9, indicating that the dendrimers
are densely packed. Consequently, the interparticle distances in the
dendrimicelle core range between ∼3 and ∼15 nm (Figure S3). While analyzing the dendrimicelles
in the cryoTEM micrograph, we observed ordering and organization on
the micrometer scale, suggesting the formation of monolayer superstructures.

To investigate the effect of the dendrimicelles on the higher-order
organization, we prepared a series of dendrimicelles made from different
dendrimer generations and studied these with cryoTEM. Representative
cryoTEM micrographs of the series of dendrimicelles based on Au-DENs
of generation 7, 8, and 9 PAMAM are shown in Figure 2a–c. The micrometer-sized grid holes
contain several hundred micelles, which organize by size and into
domains with discrete geometric patterns. Image analysis allowed for
particle tracking and segmentation of individual micelles and was
subsequently used to graphically display the positions and size of
the micelles, with color coding highlighting the small size differences
observed (Figure 2d–f).
The color coding also facilitates the discrimination of a clear size
sorting in the patterns, with the smaller micelles being positioned
more toward the center of the circular superstructures and the bigger
ones more toward the outside. The vitreous ice layer formed in the
holes of the TEM grid foil is biconcave shaped and thinner toward
the center.23−25Figures S4–6 show
average image intensity plots as derived from the TEM micrographs,
which are indicative for the thickness of the vitreous ice layer.
These figures confirm that the ice layer is thinner toward the center
of the dendrimicelle superstructure and give an estimate of the curvature
of the biconcave thin film.

the cryoTEM images are the 2–3 nm gold nanoparticles residing
inside the dendrimers in the micelle core; scale bars correspond to
200 nm. (d–f) Image segmentation results in heat map plots
with micelle cores color-coded according to their size. (g–i)
Radial distance plots show micelle diameter versus distance to the center of the pattern.

Plotting the determined micellar core diameter against the
distance
from the center of the superstructure further corroborates the size
sorting (Figure 2g–i)
and shows the micelles evidently sort according to the thickness of
the water layer. Additionally, clear domains with different geometric
patterns are observed for all three different dendrimicelle systems
(Figures S7–9) and appeared in samples
prepared on different occasions and with different preparation protocols.
CryoTEM provides snapshots of the micelle organization process during
and after the blotting step, which does not necessarily represent
a thermodynamic equilibrium state of the dendrimicelles in the thin
film. The formation of the water layer in the blotting process prior
to vitrification inflicts dramatic forces on the sample. In fact,
the micrometer-size circular areas observed often consist of multiple
domains (Figures S7–9 for highlighted
domains) and characteristic geometric patterns and five and seven
nearest neighbor sites (Figures S10–12).

The size sorting of dendrimicelles in the biconcave thin
water
film was further investigated with dendrimicelle samples obtained
under noncharge stoichiometric conditions, i.e., with a 1.5 times excess of block copolymer. The resulting
dendrimicelles were expected to be more polydisperse and show different
packing and size sorting in the formed superstructures. Indeed, all
three dendrimicelles, obtained from G7, G8, and G9 DENs, show increased
size-sorting features (see Figures S13–19). The most prominent example was obtained from a G7 dendrimicelle,
shown in Figure 3.
The TEM micrograph and the generated color-labeled heat map plot show
a dramatic size sorting (Figure 3a–c). A cross section of the superstructure
further highlights this sorting of dendrimicelles with sizes that
range in the core diameter from 10 to 20 nm. The size sorting is most
likely templated by the thickness of the thin water film formed during
sample preparation, which is a double, biconcave, air–water
interface that becomes thinner toward the center (see Figure 3f). We note that when this
layer is too thick, we do not detect the formation of the superstructures
nor observe size sorting and only witness dendrimicelles that are
randomly distributed throughout the TEM grid hole.

the cryoTEM micrograph (d) and corresponding heat map (e) visualizing

of differently sized micelles in the thin biconcave water layer in
a TEM-grid hole.

Monolayer superstructures
typically form as real 2D structures
on flat surfaces, at solvent–-air interfaces, or on curved
surfaces.26−31 The biconcave thin water layer formed in the cryoTEM preparation
provides a double air–water curved interface where the micelles
are likely arranging symmetrically in the layer, touching both interfaces.
Interestingly, the thin water layer in the center of the superstructure
shown in Figure 3 does
not contain any dendrimicelles, indicating the layer to be thinner
than 20 nm and possibly just a few nanometers in the center. Figure S14 shows the average intensity plot over
the superstructure, corroborating the size sorting observed with the
ice layer thickness.

The size-sorting and pattern formation
have been further investigated
in detail for a generation 7 PAMAM-based dendrimicelle with particularly
large domains. Figure 4a shows a cryoTEM image with Au-DENs revealing domains hundreds of
nanometers across containing multiple spiral geometries (see Supplementary Figures S20–22 for enlarged
figures). Segmentation of the TEM micrograph allowed reconstruction
of the image, showing interesting double-spiral domains, of which
a few have been highlighted (Figure 4b). Similar Fibonacci-related spiral patterns and symmetry
are commonly observed in nature at millimeter, centimeter, or even
larger scales,1−3e.g., the archetypical
sunflower seed head (Figure 4c). More recently, such geometries have been discovered to
form in stress-induced micrometer-sized core–shell particles28 and Fibonacci-related ordering is observed also
in 2D quasicrystals.32 The spiral patterning
features observed for the micelle superstructures in the biconcave
thin water layer template is further extending this extraordinary
symmetry into the nanoscale.

features such as intersecting spirals, a feature commonly observed

Conclusions
The micelle strategy presented here offers stable
structures (Supplementary Figure S23) with
a great potential
for further generating and understanding hierarchically orchestrated
[particle-in-a-box]-in-a-box superstructures, via changing the nanoparticle or dendrimer loading, using different
types of dendrimers or micelles, or with different or even mixed components.
Finally, the ordering is not expected to be limited to micelle structures,
but might be well observed for other (bio)macromolecular and/or supramolecularly
assembled systems. The biconcave water layer that progressively becomes
thinner in the cryoTEM sample preparation induces physical stress
on the sample, which together with the complex interplay of attractive
and repulsive forces between the micelles, solvent, and air at the
water–air interfaces eventually results in assembly and formation
of the superstructures. For 3D systems, the packing of soft nanoparticles
has been investigated and modeled in great detail.33 Paradoxically, 2D systems, like the superstructures presented
here, are of a very different complexity, in which not only interparticle
forces play a role,34 but also polydispersity
and size gradients, air–solvent interfaces, and reciprocal
template effects play crucial roles. In addition, the deformability
of micelles under stress could also play a role, as particle shape
has shown to be of influence for packing as well.27 Finally, relatively large domains are observed, yet the
presence of multiple domains within one superstructure indicates the
pictures obtained are snapshots of out-of-equilibrium situations.
It is experimentally a challenge to get control on all parameters
involved in the cryoTEM sample preparation, which is currently one
of our interest areas for further research. Nanoparticles, dendrimers,
and micelles all find wide applications in fields such as optically
or magnetically active materials, and the superstructures presented
here might provide 2D superlattices with emerging properties related
to the ordering of the nanoscale building blocks, for which in nature
occurring patterns can serve as inspiration. The presented strategy
offers a plethora of variations in supramolecular building blocks
to investigate hierarchical organization, pattern formation, size
sorting, and ordering mechanisms at the nanoscale, and we anticipate
our work will inspire exploration of alternative avenues for fabrication
of metamaterials, e.g., thin film
nonperiodic superlattices with concomitant emerging properties.31,35−41 The parallels with the study of ordered structures found in nature,1,2,19,20 in botany described as phyllotaxis, inspired us to define the current
field of study as nanotaxis.

Experimental Section
Materials
Amine-terminated polyamidoamino dendrimers
generation 7–9 were obtained from Dendritech Inc., MI, USA,
as 5 wt % methanolic solutions. pMAA64-b-PEO885 (Mw/Mn = 1.15) was obtained from Polymer Sources Inc., Canada,
and used as a 5 mM solution based on carboxylic acid content. HAuCl4·3H2O was obtained from TCI. (3-(N-Morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) (MOPS), NaBH4,
1 M HCl, and 1 M NaOH solutions were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
NaOD, DCl, and D2O with a purity of 99.96% D were obtained
from Eurisotop, France.

Apparatus
DLS was done on a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano
S equipped with a laser operating at 633 nm. Sample grids for electron
microscopy were obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS, Hatfield,
PA, USA) and were rendered hydrophilic using a plasma cleaning setup
(15 s at 10–1 Torr). For cryoTEM, samples were cast
on Quantifoil R2/2 grids or 400 mesh holey carbon grids. After blotting,
samples were plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot system (FEI
Company). Samples were imaged at ∼90 K in a JEOL 2100 TEM operating
at 200 kV. For normal TEM, solutions were deposited on hydrophilic
400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids. The micrographs shown are representative
for grid holes at different locations on the TEM grids and for samples
made on different days. TEM image analyses were done using custom
MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and FIJI (https://fiji.sc/).

Synthesis of
Dendrimer-Encapsulated Nanoparticles
G7-Au256DENs
were made following established protocols.15 Briefly, 50 μL (17 nmol) of 5 wt % PAMAM
G7-NH2 in methanol was transferred to a 5 mL vial, and
the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Next, 2 mL of water
was added to dissolve the PAMAM, and the pH was adjusted to 3 using
1 M HCl, after which 256 molar equiv of Au3+ to PAMAM were
added as 1 mL of a 4.4 mM aqueous solution of HAuCl4 at
pH 3. The resulting solution was then stirred for 20 min, after which
44 μL of a 1 M solution of NaBH4 in 0.3 M NaOH (10
molar equiv to Au3+) was added. This resulted in the reduction
of Au3+ to AuDENs, indicated by the change from colorless
to a dark brown solution within seconds after addition. After reduction,
the pH was set to 7 using HCl, and the Au256DENS were stored
at 4 °C as a 5.6 μM solution. The G8 and G9 DENs were made
in a similar way, using 512 and 1024 equivalents, respectively, of
Au:PAMAM-NH2.

Dendrimer-Encapsulated Nanoparticles in Micelles
To
obtain dendrimicelles under charge stoichiometric conditions, 20 μL
of GX DENs (∼58 nmol positive charge based on surface groups,
GX being generation 7, 8, or 9 PAMAM) was dissolved in 149 μL
of water, and 20 μL of 0.2 M MOPS buffer at pH 7.0 was added.
Then, 11 μL of pMAA64-b-PEO885 (55 nmol based on −COOH) was added, and the sample
was sonicated for 2 min. To obtain more polydisperse micelles off-stoichiometric
charge fractions were used. Here, the ratio of block copolymer to
dendrimer was adjusted accordingly, keeping the final volume constant
at 200 μL. Samples were left to equilibrate for at least 1 day
before characterization using cryoTEM.

Image Segmentation
To allow for an in-depth analysis
of the individual micelle characteristics within the images, a semiautomatic
micelle segmentation protocol was developed. This segmentation consisted
of three main sections. First, an automatic intensity-based thresholding
was applied to detect the gold nanoparticles, located within the micelles.
Second, the detected features were filtered by size, excluding small
noise structures, dilated, and connected based on interparticle distance.
This generated filled circular structures, approximating the actual
micelles in the original image. Lastly, manual adjustment and verification
of the created micelle segmentation with respect to the original microscopy
image provided the final segmentation output. After the segmentation,
every segmented blob was digitally labeled and characterized for its
individual properties, e.g., micelle
centroid location, micelle area in the image, and micelle diameter.
These values were used to create heat map images, visualizing the
micelle distributions based on their area. For these images, perfectly
round circles, with the appropriate diameter, were drawn at the micelle
centroid locations, using a linear color coding to depict the size
distribution. Micelle coordinates were converted to polar coordinates
using the approximated center of the pattern. The nearest neighbors
of a dendrimicelle were defined as the particles that have their centroid
coordinates located within a circle with a radius of 1.5 times the
distance of a dendrimicelle and its closest neighbor.

Dendrimicelle
Core Packing Density
The dendrimicelle
core packing density was calculated by dividing the core volume by
the total dendrimer volume inside the core. The total dendrimer volume
inside the dendrimicelle core was calculated by multiplying the number
of dendrimers per dendrimicelle by the dendrimer volume. The dendrimer
volume was calculated from the manufacturer’s specified diameter
(8.1, 9.7, and 11.4 nm for G7, G8, and G9 PAMAM dendrimers, respectively),
assuming the dendrimers to be spherical.
