More
than 5% of any population suffers from asthma, and there are
indications that these individuals are more sensitive to nanoparticle
aerosols than the healthy population. We used an air–liquid
interface model of inhalation exposure to investigate global transcriptomic
responses in reconstituted three-dimensional airway epithelia of healthy
and asthmatic subjects exposed to pristine (nCuO) and carboxylated
(nCuOCOOH) copper oxide nanoparticle aerosols. A dose-dependent
increase in cytotoxicity (highest in asthmatic donor cells) and pro-inflammatory
signaling within 24 h confirmed the reliability and sensitivity of
the system to detect acute inhalation toxicity. Gene expression changes
between nanoparticle-exposed versus air-exposed cells
were investigated. Hierarchical clustering based on the expression
profiles of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs), cell-death-associated
DEGs (567 genes), or a subset of 48 highly overlapping DEGs categorized
all samples according to “exposure severity”, wherein
nanoparticle surface chemistry and asthma are incorporated into the
dose–response axis. For example, asthmatics exposed to low
and medium dose nCuO clustered with healthy donor cells exposed to
medium and high dose nCuO, respectively. Of note, a set of genes with
high relevance to mucociliary clearance were observed to distinctly
differentiate asthmatic and healthy donor cells. These genes also
responded differently to nCuO and nCuOCOOH nanoparticles.
Additionally, because response
to transition-metal nanoparticles was a highly enriched Gene Ontology
term (FDR 8 × 10–13) from the subset of 48
highly overlapping DEGs, these genes may represent biomarkers to a
potentially large variety of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles.

==== Body
Asthma is
a chronic respiratory
disease with extremely high susceptibility to environmental exposures
such as allergens,1 chemicals,2 and particulate air pollutants.3−5 Asthmatic airways are typically chronically inflamed and extremely
hyper-reactive, with symptoms such as recurrent wheezing, coughing,
and shortness of breath. Asthma prevalence has steadily increased
over the last three decades and is a major public health burden. The
most recent survey estimates that as much as 4.4% of the global population
(334 million people) is affected by asthma (Global Asthma Network,
2014). There is thus a clear need to prioritize development of comprehensive
risk assessment frameworks and tools that take this highly susceptible
population into account during implementation of regulatory and monitoring
programs to curb or follow up on potentially hazardous exposures.

The varied and configurable physical and chemical properties of
ENM amplify their industrial and medical applicability. Unfortunately,
the toxicity of ENM can be mediated by physical and chemical properties;
including, but not limited to size, shape, surface charge, aspect
ratio, functionalization, etc.6,7 As
a result, the number of toxicologically relevant nanoforms scales
dramatically. With regards to health hazard assessment, this poses
a tremendous burden (costs and ethical considerations) on the extent
of animal testing that will be required. Efficient, accurate and scalable ex vivo test methods which are still applicable to human
exposures and can be used to evaluate the potential health hazards
associated with ENM in a timely manner, are needed. Three-dimensional
cocultures for nanoparticle exposure at an air–liquid interface
that mimics the human lung have recently been developed.8,9 Using this system in combination with adverse outcome assays, in vitro simulation of particle exposure and potential health
hazard has been successfully performed for airborne particles and
fibers.10−14

Metal oxides are one of the most abundantly produced types
of engineered
nanomaterials (ENM) with production volumes of up to thousands of
tons every year. The electrical, optical, and magnetic features of
copper oxide (CuO) makes them appealing for a variety of industrial
and commercial applications such as electronic chips, solar cells,
lithium batteries, paints, processed wood, and plastics. CuO nanomaterials
have already been used or could be utilized in food packaging,15 wound dressings,16 skin products, and hospital textiles.17 Production volumes of CuO nanoparticles are expected to reach 1600
tons by the year 2025.18 Therefore, because
CuO has a very high potential for both occupational and consumer exposure,
we have used it as a model to investigate potentially enhanced nanoparticle
sensitivity within the context of pre-existing asthma. Unraveling
the mechanistic interplay between nanoscale materials and asthma has
been thus far limited to a handful of studies.19 As such, employing an in vitro 3D human
bronchial epithelial model in tandem with extensive downstream transcriptomic
assessment in healthy and vulnerable individuals with a disease-compromised
respiratory system is the subject of this study. 3D human bronchial
epithelial cells cultured at an air–liquid interface that mimics
relevant inhalatory exposure20 were exposed
to aerosols of pristine (nCuO) and carboxylated (nCuOCOOH) copper oxide nanoparticles. We hypothesized that coupling this
exposure setup with global transcriptomic assessment will enable identification
of altered defense mechanisms and/or enhanced particle sensitivity
as a result of pre-existing asthma. In addition, because these primary
cells are derived from nasal/bronchial biopsies of donors, mode-of-action
based approaches can inform on biomarker candidates that can be developed
and investigated via noninvasive sampling in “high-exposure-risk”
and “high-susceptibility” subjects.

Results and Discussion
Experimental
Setup and Particle Dose Characterization
The experimental
setup is depicted in Figure 1A. Cells were exposed to nanoparticle aerosols
for 1 h, and all assay samples were collected after a 24 h incubation
period. In a single-exposure experiment, air control, low-, mid-,
and high-dose groups are exposed simultaneously using a Vitrocell
exposure system. Each Vitrocell consists of three slots (inserts);
thus, every time a test block is exposed, the cell material within
its three inserts originates from a single donor only. Previous work
has shown that when using this approach, for any parameter, differences
in the average for the donors are not affected by differences among
sessions, test blocks, or concentrations.20 Similarly, the differences in averages of the four CuO concentrations
are not affected by interdonor variation.

exposure, nanoparticle, and donor cell
characterization. (A) Schematic of aerosolization, dilution, exposures,
and implemented downstream bioassays. (B) Scanning electron microscope
view of pristine (nCuO, upper panel) and COOH-functionalized (nCuOCOOH, lower panel) copper oxide nanoparticles on a filter membrane.
The filter pore sizes were 0.4 μm (nCuO) and 0.8 μm (nCuOCOOH). Twenty-four hours after the 1 h exposures at four different
doses, particle deposition could be visually observed in all non-zero
doses. Representative images of an air (zero) versus high dose in healthy and asthmatic donor cells are shown in (C).
Cell layers of donor cells are more homogeneous compared to asthmatic
cells. Changes in cell cytotoxicity were assessed by measuring release
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into culture medium (D). Twenty-four
hours after exposures, a dose-dependent increase in relative LDH release,
consistent with increasing cytotoxicity, was observed for both nanomaterials
and cell types (D). The y-axis represents percent
cellular cytotoxicity, with respect to their corresponding air-exposed
controls. Maximum cell death observed across all exposures was around
25%. Cytotoxicity was highest in asthmatic donor cells, and pristine
nCuO appears to be more cytotoxic than COOH-functionalized nCuO (nCuOCOOH). Bars are the mean with SD of three (healthy) or five
(asthmatic) biological replicates. Each value was derived from the
mean of three technical replicates. Statistical significance was inferred via two-way ANOVA and * denotes p-value
< 0.05.

Aerosolization of nCuO resulted
in agglomeration or aggregation
of the particles with a median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of
1.8 μm (geometric SD = 1.57) and a MMAD of 1.4 μm (geometric
SD = 1.48) for nCuOCOOH, measured using an aerodynamic
particle sizer (APS) in the high dose (buffer chamber). Agglomerates
or aggregates are likely to be the predominant form of the particle
that interacted with all types of cells in our experiments. Such agglomeration
or aggregation has been reported before.21,22 Particle concentration was calculated using an APS and a scanning
mobility particle sizer (SMPS) simultaneously. APS/SMPS analyses showed
particle concentrations of 6.15 × 105 and 1.65 ×
106 particles/cm3 for nCuO and nCuOCOOH, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are shown
in Figure 1B. The actual
exposure concentrations for the low, mid, and high groups were deduced
from parallel exposures to be 23, 120, and 470 mg/m3, respectively,
for nCuO and 32, 128, and 495 mg/m3 for nCuOCOOH. The deposited dose was determined for the low and mid groups to
be 14% (nCuO) and 15% (nCuOCOOH) of the actual exposure
concentrations. Because particle deposition at constant flow rates
is governed by particle diameter,23 we
can directly infer that similar deposition rates (14–15%) will
be observed in the high group exposures. Aerosol deposition mechanisms
in the lungs, especially with relevance to drug delivery, have been
well studied. The deposition of an inhaled particle is dependent on
its size. Keeping in mind that the aerosolized nanoparticles consisted
of agglomerates with a mean diameter of 1.8 μm (nCuOCOOH nanoparticles) and 1.4 μm (nCuO nanoparticles), the observed
14–15% deposition rate is in line with modeled and experimentally
determined 10 to 20% human bronchial airway deposition of unit density
particles with a diameter of 1–2 μm.24,25

Real-Life Human Exposure Extrapolation
Extrapolating in vitro doses to human lungs is often problematic because
lung morphology, air flow patterns and mucociliary particle clearance
are all subject to inter individual and physiological state variability.26 Nonetheless, we have combined previous calculations
from similar exposure scenarios to derive estimates of the equivalent
human exposures for the low, mid and high doses used herein. Regulatory
occupational exposure limits do not exist for CuO and its derived
nanoparticles. Going by the permissible exposure limit (PEL) (5 mg/m3) for respirable dust of particles not otherwise regulated
as defined by the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration
(2012), the low, mid and high dose exposures corresponded to approximately
1, 6, and 22 8 h work days of constant human conducting airways exposure.

These real-life exposures were extrapolated as follows: first we
averaged the two concentrations corresponding to low (23 and 32 mg/m3), mid (120 and 128 mg/m3), or high dose (470 and
495 mg/m3) for nCuO and nCuOCOOH particles.
Having used the same Vitrocell air–liquid interface exposure
system, we next derived mass/surface area exposure concentrations
from 27.5 mg/m3 (low), 124 mg/m3 (mid), and
482.5 mg/m3 (high) concentrations, as described for exposure
of CeO2 nanoparticles.10 Following
these calculations (summarized in materials and methods section),
at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and 15% deposition, donor cells in each
Vitrocell insert were exposed to approximately 1.2 μg/cm2 (low), 5.6 μg/cm2 (mid), and 21.7 μg/cm2 (high) nanoparticles. The average deposited dose normalized
by the regional surface area is the default dose metric for respiratory
effects of inhaled poorly soluble particles.27 As such, we extrapolated the mass/area doses of the air–liquid
interface to human bronchial epithelium. Incidentally, for particles
with average aerodynamic diameters of 1–2 μm24 (note that the MMAD of aggregates/agglomerates
of nCuO and nCuOCOOH nanoparticles in the current exposures
are 1.8 and 1.4 μm, respectively), five different deposition
models have assigned a bronchial deposition rate of around 10%. Human
bronchial airway surface area of 2709–4767 cm2 for
a healthy adult have been reported.27,28 To avoid being
too conservative in our human equivalent dose estimates, we will use
the 4767 cm2 bronchial surface area to derive region-specific
doses. Finally, in order to relate the human equivalent dose to a
real-life scenario, we based our extrapolations on the 5 mg/m3 PEL of occupational exposure (NIOSH, 2012). Shvedova and
colleagues29 estimated the workplace nanoparticle
human lung burden per day as      This implies,
the low (1.2 μg/cm2), mid (5.6 μg/cm2) and high (21.7 μg/cm2) doses used in our study
can be extrapolated to 1.2 ÷
1.006 = 1.2 days, 5.9 ÷ 1.006 = 5.8 days and 21.7 ÷ 1.006
= 21.6 days of constant exposure of the bronchial airway to CuO and
CuOCOOH nanoparticle aerosols in an occupational setting.
Therefore, all three doses employed in the described air–liquid
interface exposures can be described as human-relevant, from a realistic
exposure perspective.

Visual Microscopic Inspection and Cellular
Cytotoxicity Assessment
Microscopic examinations prior to
nanoparticle exposure of the
epithelia reveal vacuoles formed by enlarged cells. Such structures
could also be observed in the epithelia constituted with cells from
healthy donors, even though to a lesser extent (Figure 1C, air exposure). These vacuoles do not compromise
the barrier function of the epithelia, since the regularly measured
transepithelial electrical resistance of the epithelia derived from
asthmatic donor cells was within the normal range (>100 Ω*cm2). In addition, when these asthmatic 3D cultures are established,
culture media is absent from the apical surface of the epithelia,
further confirming the structural integrity of the epithelial surface
(information obtained via personal correspondence
with Epithelix). Nanoparticle exposure of cells resulted
in visual observable particle deposition at all doses, with the cells
of asthmatic origin showing a less homogeneous cell layer compared
to the cells from healthy donors (Figure 1C, high dose exposure). In both the healthy
and asthmatic cells, we also observed cilia beating before and immediately
after the exposures. Twenty-four hours after the 1 h exposures, most
of the nanoparticle agglomerates/aggregates were located on the outer
side of the insert, possibly moved there by beating cilia. LDH measurements
showed that the cellular cytotoxicity was less than 25% in all exposures
(Figure 1D). Compared
to unexposed cells, a significant (p-value < 0.05)
increase in cytotoxicity was observed in both healthy (high dose only)
and asthmatic cells (low, mid, and high dose), with the highest levels
of cytotoxicity detected in asthmatics. With impaired tracheobronchial
mucociliary clearance observed even in the airways of nonsymptomatic
asthmatic subjects,30 a higher nanoparticle-induced
cellular cytotoxicity in asthmatic donor cells confirms the reliability
of the model to distinguish asthmatic and healthy bronchial airways.
Inefficient particle clearance prolongs epithelium–nanoparticle
interaction, which may lead to exacerbated particle-induced cytotoxicity
from dissolved Cu2+ ions or enhanced particle uptake. NCuO
induced greater cytotoxicity when compared to nCuOCOOH in
both healthy and asthmatic donor cells. Studies have shown that cell-binding
events and internalization of nanoparticles are largely mediated by
their surface chemistries (reviewed by Mu et al.(31)). Phospholipids, containing negatively charged
phosphate groups, are the main components of pulmonary surfactant
and cell membranes. The relatively lower apoptotic potential of the
nCuOCOOH particles may be due (in part) to the fact that
in an aqueous environment such as the surface of the respiratory epithelium
deprotonation of the COOH functional group yields anionic nCuOCOO- nanoparticles with poor membrane binding efficiency
(hence uptake). This line of reasoning is consistent with studies
showing enhanced cytotoxicity of positively charged metal and metalloid
nanoparticles relative to their neutral counterparts.32

Selected Pro-inflammatory Cytokines Are Elevated
in a Dose-Dependent
Manner
Being more than just a barrier, the airway epithelium
synthesizes and releases potent immunomodulators like chemokines,
cytokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in response
to an external stimulant. These responses typify an intact defense
response characteristic of human airway epithelia.33 Depending on the dose and type of material, ENM exposures
typically trigger inflammation, marked by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. Twenty-four hours after the nanoparticle exposures, we
investigated changes in IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 since induction of these
cytokines has been observed in bronchial epithelial cell cultures
exposed to CuO and other metal oxide nanoparticles such as CeO2, TiO2, and ZnO.34−38 IL-8 was the most elevated of all three cytokines.
Increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in three healthy and
five asthmatic donor cells (Suppl. Figure 1A). Release of IL-6 and IL-8 was dose dependent, being most significant
(p-value < 0.0001) in donor cells exposed to the
highest dose of nCuO nanoparticles. MCP-1 was found to be elevated
(only in response to pristine nCuO nanoparticles) in two out of three
and two out of five healthy and asthmatic donor cells, respectively
(Suppl. Figure 1B). IL-6 is a pleiotropic
cytokine with a wide range of biological activities in immune regulation,
hematopoiesis, inflammation, and oncogenesis,39 while IL-8 and MCP-1 are neutrophil- and monocyte/basophil-attracting
chemokines, respectively. Given that the maximum level of MCP-1 measured
across all donor cells was 4- to 75-fold less than that of IL-6 and
IL-8 respectively, assay detection limits coupled to technical variability
might explain the observed inconsistency in MCP-1 induction. No significant
difference in IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was observed between healthy
and asthmatic donor cells (Figure 2A), even after normalizing cytokine release to percentage
cell viability (data not shown). The expression trend of all three
cytokines, as measured by microarray analysis was similar to secreted
protein abundance (Figure 2B). Although macrophages are very often emphasized to be the
first line of defense in pulmonary ENM-induced responses,40 release of IL-8 suggests that in the bronchial
areas of the lungs, epithelial cells are the responsible cell type
that play a role in triggering innate immunity responses and neutrophil
influx into the lung tissue to uptake/internalize foreign particles.
This is in line with the well-studied role of the respiratory epithelium
in cytokine-mediated innate defense (reviewed in Whitsett and Alenghat41). In terms of the nanomaterial type, nCuO appears
to be more bioreactive than nCuOCOOH, as the highest levels
of all three pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed after nCuO exposure
(Figure 2A,B).

Figure 2 Cytokine profiling
after nanoparticle exposures. Release of selected
pro-inflammatory cytokines, previously associated with exposure to
CuO nanoparticles, including their agglomerates/aggregates, was carried
out after exposures (A). Twenty-four hours after exposures, a dose-dependent
release of IL-6 and IL-8 was measured from cell culture medium. No
clear dose-dependent pattern was observed for MCP-1 release. Overall,
the expression trend across doses for each nanoparticle was similar
between protein (released cytokines) and mRNA measured via microarray-based gene expression profiling (B). Statistical significance
was inferred using two-way ANOVA. Transcript and protein levels of
IL-6 and IL-8 progressively increase with dose, with the most significant
differences observed between air-exposed and high dose-exposed donor
cells in both asthmatic and healthy donor cells. A significant difference
between asthmatic and healthy donor cells was only observed for IL-6
and IL-8 mRNA levels in cells exposed to the highest concentrations
of nCuO. Degree of significance is represented by an *, where *, **,
***, and **** indicate p values <0.05, <0.01,
<0.001, and <0.0001, respectively.

Transcriptomic Profiling of Control and Asthmatic Donor Bronchial
Epithelia Identifies Known Asthma-Related Genes
Previous
studies have reported similarities between the mRNA expression profiles
of epithelial cells cultured at the air–liquid interface and
that of tracheal and bronchial brushings from human airways.42,43 To validate the disease model in this study, we examined whether
the relative expression of known asthma-associated genes, for the
corresponding tissue type (bronchial epithelium), was consistent with
the published literature. We identified genes related to asthma by
microarray-based comparative transcriptomics on total RNA isolated
from asthmatic and healthy donor cells that had only been exposed
to control air. In addition, potential disease-modulating effects
resulting from particle exposure were also investigated by analysis
of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in healthy versus asthmatic bronchial epithelial donor cells exposed at the air–liquid
interface to CuO and CuOCOOH nanoparticle-derived aerosols.
The ENM doses were selected such that cytotoxicity was less than 30%
even with the highest dose. By this approach, gene expression profiling
identifies early transcriptomic responses (biomarkers) that reflect
the bioreactivity of CuO nanoparticles and not just genes that are
related to general cell death.

Pathway analysis of genes identified
as upregulated genes in asthmatic donor cells revealed a highly significant
(FDR 1 × 10–22) enrichment of genes that are
functionally involved in extracellular matrix organization (Figure 3A). The most upregulated
of which are collagen (COL1AI, COL4A1, COL4A2, COL5A2 and COL7A1),
TNC (tenascin C, a fibronectin binding protein), cadherin (CDH2, CDH4
and CDH11), MRC2 (mannose receptor C type 2), and MMP13 (Matrix Metallopeptidase13).
The relative expression of these genes is in line with the increased
expression of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, MMP9, and
MMP12) observed within the airway smooth muscle of asthma patients
when compared to nonasthmatic controls.44 Araujo and colleagues44 also observed
that deposition of type-I and type-III collagens correlated with the
clinical severity of asthma. Asthma heterogeneity is widely acknowledged,
with allergic asthma, mediated by allergen-specific T helper type
2 (TH2) cells, the most common and most studied form of
asthma.45 Being that its hallmark mechanistic
feature is the synthesis and release of the TH2 cytokines,
IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13,46 it is no surprise
that their expression levels were close to background in the studied
airway epithelial cell models. However, we did detect significantly
elevated expression of IL-33 and TSLP (known inducers of TH2-type proinflammatory mediators) in asthmatic donor cells (Suppl. Figure 2A). Similarly, elevated levels
of IL-33 or TSLP, coupled with a concomitant correlation to disease
severity, have been observed in bronchial biopsies and cultured bronchial
epithelial cells derived from asthmatic patients.47−49 In terms of
morphological changes, mucus accumulation (implicated in airway obstruction)
is a prominent feature of asthma. Mucus hypersecretion, marked by
an increase in the number of goblet cells and upregulation of mucin
genes (notably MUC5AC and MUC5AB), as well as altered mucus clearance
due to a decrease in the number of ciliated cells and/or cilia viability,
are thought to both contribute to mucus accumulation in asthmatic
airways. Incidentally, we identified modest but significant decrease
in expression of FOXJ1 (marker of ciliated epithelial cells) and an
increase in both MUC5AC (marker of goblet cells) and MUC5B in asthmatic
donor cells (Suppl. Figure 2B). Several
other mucin and mucin-like genes, MUC1, MUCL1, MUC2, MUC4, and MUC7,
were also identified as significantly upregulated in MucilAir cells
from asthmatic donors (Suppl. Figure 2C). A hierarchical cluster consisting of these upregulated mucin genes
clearly separates asthmatic from control donor cells (Suppl. Figure 2D).

Figure 3 Transcriptomic profiling
of asthmatics versus healthy
when exposed to air, nCuO, or nCuOCOOH. The gene expression
of asthmatics was compared to that of healthy donor cells after exposure
to control air and three doses of nanoparticle-derived aerosols. (A)
The most upregulated genes in asthma air/healthy air consists of genes
that represent a highly significant (FDR 1 × 10–22) functional enrichment of extracellular matrix organization. (B)
Venn comparisons of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified
in asthma/healthy exposed to air to the combined DEGs from asthma/healthy
exposed to low-, mid-, and high-dose nCuO and low-, mid-, and high-dose
nCuOCOOH reveal there is very little overlap across identified
DEGs. This suggests there is a strong interaction between nanoparticle
exposure and asthmatic phenotype. (C) K-means clustering of only the
164 DEGs between asthma and healthy exposed to air, across all exposures,
separates air-exposed asthmatics and air-exposed healthy cells to
the most distant clusters. Clusters of healthy donor cells exposed
to control air are colored brown, and those for asthmatic donor cells
exposed to control air are colored pink.

To answer whether particle exposure modulates the asthmatic
genotype,
we compared gene expression changes between asthmatic and healthy
donor cells exposed to air or nanoparticle-derived aerosols. A Venn
distribution of the topmost DEGs (fold change cutoff ≥1.5-fold
and a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR of at most 5%) between healthy
and asthmatic donor cells exposed to Air, nCuO, or nCuOCOOH is shown in Figure 3B. K-means clustering of all exposure groups, based only on the genes
that were differentially expressed between asthmatic and healthy donor
cells exposed to the control air stream, is depicted in Figure 3C. Within this dendrogram,
the healthy and asthmatic groups occupy clusters that are farthest
from each other. Conversely, if in addition to the genes that were
different between asthmatics and healthy exposed to air those genes
differing between asthmatic and healthy donor cells exposed to either
nCuO or nCuOCOOH nanoparticle aerosols are included prior
to hierarchical cluster generation, partitioning of the resulting
cluster dendrogram then becomes based on exposure dose, with the asthmatic
air and healthy air groups occupying closely related clusters (Suppl. Figure 3A,B).

In summary, when comparing
air-exposed healthy and asthmatics,
the main difference between all samples is driven by disease-related
genes, and when the exposure to nanomaterials is considered, the main
difference between samples is driven by the exposure dose. The top
pathways enriched by the genes that are differentially expressed between
asthmatics and healthy, when unexposed (air) or exposed to either
nCuO or nCuOCOOH, are shown in Suppl. Figure 3C. An alteration from asthma-relevant pathways (extracellular
matrix organization, FDR 1 × 10–22; collagen
metabolic process, FDR 1 × 10–17; extracellular
matrix part, FDR 3 × 10–16) to pathways associated
with adverse effects of metal oxide nanomaterials (DNA damage response,
FDR 1 × 10–6 to 1 × 10–2; response to metal ion, FDR 6 × 10–14 to
1 × 10–8; response to inorganic substance,
FDR 2 × 10–7) is observed. Taken together,
this indicates that in response to nanoparticle exposure, the effects
of the disease (i.e., asthma) are overshadowed by
the adverse exposure outcomes at the doses tested. From a mechanistic
viewpoint, a notable limitation of the current study is that Mucilair
asthmatic donor cells are obtained based only on symptomatic, as such
given the limited number of asthmatic donors (N =
5), it is impossible to investigate particle exposure susceptibilities
of different asthma subtypes.

Expression Profile of DEGs
Incorporate Nanomaterial Dose, Functionalization
and Asthma into the Dose–Response Axis
To characterize
the gene expression profiles that represent adverse exposure to both
nCuO and nCuOCOOH as a function of dose, functional group,
and disease state, a total of 12 contrast sets for identification
of DEGs were specified. The number of DEGs identified in each of the
specified contrast sets (A–L) is shown in Suppl. Figure 4A. In total, 6523 DEGs were observed across
all comparisons. The number of DEGs correlated with the dose (progressive
increase in the number of DEGs from low dose to high dose). No obvious
trend could be identified from the number of DEGs with respect to
material type or disease state. However, the total number of DEGs
from contrasts reflecting exposure to nanoparticles irrespective of
disease state, or disease state exposures irrespective of the particle
type, was similar for healthy and asthmatics, while an excess of 1627
DEGs was observed in nCuO relative to the nCuOCOOH exposures
(Suppl. Figure 4B). This supports our previously
mentioned observation that following exposure to CuO nanomaterials
the difference between healthy and asthmatic cells is mainly driven
by genes that are modulated in response to the nanomaterial exposure
(Suppl. Figure 3C). On this basis, the
main difference between asthmatic and healthy cells in response to
nCuO/nCuOCOOH is more likely to be as a result of differences
in sensitivity than being due to a different effect of these materials
on asthmatic airways. However, a limitation of the current study protocol
is that, in the absence of transcriptomic data over multiple time
points, we cannot rule out the possibility that the enhanced sensitivity
of the asthmatic epithelium derives from delayed (and not insufficient)
self-regulation upon nanoparticle-induced irritation of the airways.

In order to visualize possible trends in the data arising from
the expression profile of genes that significantly change in response
to CuO and CuOCOOH exposure, we performed a principal component
analysis (PCA) that was based exclusively on the 6523 genes that were
significantly differentially expressed between exposed cells and their
corresponding air controls. The top two principal components, explaining
about 65% of the variation, are shown in Figure 4A. The different dose groups (air, low, mid
and high) in the PCA plot are highlighted with distinct colors and
oval shapes (legend). Interestingly there are regions of overlap between
adjacent doses (low/mid, mid/high) wherein asthmatic cells exposed
to nCuO from the lower dose are overrepresented. For example, in the
overlap between low and mid doses, low nCuO-asthmatic cells cluster
closer to the mid dose exposures than the other three [(1) nCuO-healthy,
(2) nCuOCOOH-healthy, and (3) nCuOCOOH-asthmatic]
low dose groups. The same holds true for the mid/high intersection.
This is an indication that the presence of asthma enhances the sensitivity
to the adverse effects of nCuO exposure, and this sensitivity is diminished
by functionalization to a COOH group (nCuOCOOH). This observation
is in line with cytotoxicity measurements in healthy and asthmatic
cells after nCuO and nCuOCOOH exposures (Figure 1D). We also observed that the
genes which are differentially expressed between asthmatic and healthy
donor cells exposed to only to control air were differentially expressed
between nanoparticle-exposed and air-exposed healthy and asthmatic
donor cells (Figure 4B), meaning that the genes which reflect the asthmatic genotype in
this cohort are also involved in the response to nanoparticle exposure.
This could explain why the asthma versus healthy
gene expression profiles were so different for donor cells exposed
to either air or aggregates/agglomerates of nCuO or nCuOCOOH nanoparticles (Figure 3A). It is possible that asthmatics are more susceptible to nanoparticle
exposure because the expression of some of the genes required to mount
a (possibly protective) response to nanoparticle exposure is skewed
in asthmatics, resulting in a delayed onset of the mechanisms required
to protect against the adverse effects caused by these particles.

Figure 4 Global
differential expressed genes and genes related to regulation
of cell death differentiate exposures according to dose, material
type, and disease state. In total, 6523 differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) were identified when exposed healthy [H] and asthmatic [A]
cells were compared to their corresponding air-exposure controls.
These genes were then obtained from the normalized expression matrix
and used for principal component analysis (PCA). The top two components,
explaining about 65% of the variance between exposures, are shown
in (A). Colored ovals with dashed lines depict the different doses
from air (zero) to high dose (A, left to right). Circular symbols
represent healthy donors and triangles represent asthmatic donors.
It can be seen from PCA that asthmatic donor cells exposed to the
relatively lower dose are overrepresented in the regions where the
low, mid and high doses overlap. This indicates interaction between
disease and nanoparticle exposure and is further highlighted by the
fact that all of the genes that are differentially expressed between
baseline asthmatics and healthy donor cells were also differentially
expressed in response to nanoparticle exposure (B). Approximately
9% (567 genes) of the DEGs between exposed and unexposed donor cells
were identified by pathway enrichment analysis to represent GO biological
processes corresponding to positive and negative regulation of cell
death. Venn distribution of these nanoparticle/air DEGs related to
cell death is shown in (C). K-means clustering, exclusively based
on these cell death related genes, differentiates and groups the samples
according to dose, surface chemistry, and disease state (D). The primary
distribution of samples across the various branches of the dendrogram
can be attributed to the nanoparticle deposited dose, wherein all
high-dose exposures were grouped together in branch 1, air-exposed
controls in branch 2A, and mid dose in branch 2B (D). All low-dose
exposures are closest to the air-exposed controls in branch 2A, except
nCuO-low dose (asthmatics), which clustered with the mid doses (branch
2B), and all mid doses clustered in branch 2A except nCuO-mid (asthmatics),
which clustered in branch 1 with the high doses.

Expression of Genes Involved in Regulation of Cell Death Correlates
with Cellular Cytotoxicity Assay
Because the dose–response
differentiation was similar for both the cytotoxicity assay and expression
profile of all DEGs, we next investigated whether this distinction
is consistent for a subset of DEGs that represent changes in cell
viability. To this end, we performed gene ontology (GO) based biological
process enrichment analysis using all 6523 DEGs as input list. We
used this global approach as opposed to biological process enrichment
analysis for each of the contrast sets depicted in Suppl. Figure 4A because the expression profile of the combined
DEGs correlated better with dose, functional group, and disease state
than the number of DEGs for every contrast. The top five enriched
nonredundant GO terms were regulation of cell death (GO:0010941),
cilium organization (GO:0044782), response to cytokine (GO:0034097),
cell projection assembly (GO:0030031), cilium assembly (GO:0060271),
and cellular response to cytokine stimulus (GO:0071345). Adverse exposure
to CuO nanoparticles is known to affect cell viability via oxidative stress, prolonged inflammation, and DNA damage.50 From the list of enriched biological processes
represented by these 6523 DEGs (Suppl. Table 1), we selected two biological processes representing specific effects
on cell death–positive (GO: 0060548–383 genes) and
negative (GO:0010942–271 genes) regulation of cell death (Figure 4C and highlighted
in Suppl. Table 2). In very much the same
way as cell cytotoxicity measurements (Figure 1D), hierarchical clustering based solely
on the expression of these regulation of cell death genes differentiates
the exposures by dose (Figure 4D). Here, the enhanced sensitivity of asthmatic airways is
evident as, asthmatic cells exposed to low and mid dose nanoparticles
cluster closest to control cells exposed to mid- and high-dose nanoparticles,
respectively. The three most distinct clusters are depicted in the
dendrogram as 1, 2A, and 2B (Figure 4C). Cluster 1 consists of all high-dose exposures as
well as mid-dose nCuO (asthmatic), cluster 2B consists of the remaining
mid-dose exposures and low-dose nCuO (asthmatic). and cluster 2A consists
of the remaining low-dose exposures and unexposed controls.

Changes
in Genes Related to Cilium Functionality Highlight the
Lower Potency of COOH-Functionalized CuO Nanoparticles and also Suggest
Defective Mucociliary Clearance May Be Responsible for Enhanced Nanoparticle
Sensitivity in Asthmatic Donor Cells
Dysfunction of cilia
organization is the second most enriched pathway represented by genes
that were differentially expressed in response to nCuO/nCuOCOOH exposure (Suppl. Table 2). Cilium assembly
and cell projection assembly are also related pathways that are highly
enriched by combined DEGs between nanoparticle-exposed and air-exposed
donor cells (Figure 5A). Similar to the human airway, the MucilAir epithelial lining is
covered by a mucus layer, which is produced by goblet cells and moved
by ciliary beating. As a first line of defense, particles trapped
within the mucus layer are cleared by highly coordinated ciliary beating,
known as mucociliary clearance.51,52 Because cilium assembly
and organization are key processes involved in mucociliary clearance,
and ciliary dysfunction is a feature of moderate to severe asthma,53 we next sought to answer whether the observed
enhanced CuO nanoparticles sensitivity in asthmatics compared to healthy
subjects, could be related to intrinsic differences in ciliary function.
To compare the relative expression of genes related to cilium organization
between any two samples, the expression of 186 DEGs representing cilium organization (GO: 0044782) across all individual
samples were Z-score normalized, separately for each nanomaterial.
This normalization enables us to derive the expression of each gene
relative to the entire population. Z-scores of each gene are then
averaged over biological replicates. Scatter plots of the average
relative expression of these genes between healthy versus asthmatic cells exposed to control air and between exposed versus unexposed cells are shown in Figure 5B,C.

Figure 5 Scatter plot of genes related to organization
of the cilia 186
differentially expressed genes were identified by pathway analysis
to represent biological functions corresponding to cilia organization/cilia
assembly (A). Average relative expression for each of these genes
were obtained by Z-score normalization of their mRNA intensity values
across all samples for the nCuO and nCuOCOOH exposures.
Z-scores were then averaged for air, low, mid, and high nanoparticle
doses. A scatter plot of air-exposed healthy versus asthmatic donor cells is shown in (B). As an example of a pre-existing
distinction between healthy and asthmatic airways, MCIDAS and RAB3IP genes with potential relevance in the
functionality of asthmatic airways are highlighted. Following exposure
to nCuO (C, upper panel) or nCuOCOOH (C, lower panel) nanoparticles/nanoparticle
agglomerates, a bigger change in expression (green lines) of cilia-related
genes can be observed in healthy when compared to asthmatic donor
cells. Furthermore, the low-dose response was distinct in all exposures,
except in asthmatics exposed to nCuO (dashed red circles), wherein
the low-dose response overlaps with the mid- and high-dose responses.

The first observation made is
that there is a positive correlation
(Pearson correlation coefficient, R = 0.64) in cilia
organization genes between healthy/asthmatic cells exposed to control
air (Figure 6B). Interestingly,
two genes that were found to be very different in average relative
expression between healthy and asthmatic donor cells, MCIDAS and RAB3IP
(Figure 5B), functionally
reflect differences between healthy and asthmatic phenotype. RAB3IP,
low expressed in asthmatic donor cells, may be of relevance in extracellular
matrix remodeling due to its role as a modulator of actin organization
(www.genecards.org). Meanwhile,
MCIDAS, which is highly upregulated in healthy donor cells, is required
for the generation of multiciliated cells in respiratory epithelium.
Patients with genetic deficiencies in MCIDAS suffer from recurrent
upper and lower respiratory tract infections due to reduced generation
of multiple motile cilia.54 Second, we
observe that, low dose exposure to either nCuO and nCuOCOOH, triggers an upregulation in the expression of cilia-related genes,
except in nCuO-exposed asthmatic donor cells (Figure 5C, red circles). Upon exposure to mid and
high dose nanoparticles, the initial upregulation is closely followed
by downregulation. Downregulation of cilia-related genes was clearly
distinct between mid and high dose in nCuOCOOH-exposed
cells. An overlap of the mid/high response was observed in nCuO-exposed
healthy donor cells while in nCuO-exposed asthmatic donor cells, the
low/mid/high response overlap. Taken together, we propose that mucociliary
clearance is activated as an initial protective response via upregulation of genes involved in cilia organization. However, an
excessive airway activation–that is tightly coupled to nanomaterial
potency (greater dose–response overlap in nCuO relative to
nCuO COOH) and asthma phenotype (greater dose–response
overlap in asthmatic cells relative to healthy cells) triggers a negative
feedback mechanism leading to downregulation of cilia-related genes.
The final observation made is that, the expression scatter of cilia-related
genes is greatest in exposed healthy donor cells (Figure 5C, green lines). That is, the
extent of variation in expression of cilia-related genes following
nanoparticle exposure is higher in healthy cells. This suggests that
mucociliary clearance may be less effective in asthmatic airways due
to an overall lower net change in expression (decreased plasticity)
of the genes that are required for cilia (re)assembly and/or (re)organization
(Figure 5C).

Figure 6 Shared DEGs
highlight core molecular signature of nanosized CuO
exposure and integrates all four tested parameters into a dose–response
gradient. Comparing nanoparticle-exposed healthy or asthmatic donor
cells to their corresponding air-exposed controls resulted in a total
of 12 contrast sets. Forty-eight differentially expressed genes were
identified to be shared between 9 or more of these contrasts sets; i.e., 33 genes were shared across 9 contrasts, 12 genes
in 10 contrasts, and 3 genes in 11 contrasts. A hierarchical cluster
(upper panel) based on these reoccurring 48 differentially expressed
genes separates all groups along a dose–response gradient,
which takes into account the material surface chemistry and tissue
health status. Response to transition metal nanoparticle, attributed
to a subset of five metallothionein 1 genes, was identified as a highly
enriched (FDR 9 × 10–13) biological process
within these 48 shared DEGs. Connections between gene nodes represent
physical, predicted, and genetic interactions as well as shared protein
domains and pathways.

A Subset of Highly Overlapping DEGs Represents a Core Signature
Response to CuO Nanoparticles
For each nanoparticle subtype,
when DEGs for each dose are combined, only 31% of the DEGs were common
between nCuO- and nCuOCOOH-exposed healthy donor cells.
Forty-four percent of the DEGs were common between asthmatic donor
cells exposed to nCuO or nCuOCOOH nanoparticle aerosols.
Based on their distinct gene expression profiles, these differentially
functionalized nanoparticles behave like two different metal nanoparticles.
However, from a health hazard diagnostic perspective, it is essential
to have a minimum set of DEGs that recapitulate organ-level sensitivity
to disease. As such, we next asked whether there is a subset of DEGs
whose expression profiles can distinguish the nanoparticle (sub)type,
exposure dose and enhanced airway sensitivity as a result of asthma.
For this purpose, we performed comprehensive Venn comparisons across
all 12 exposed/unexposed contrasts (i.e., without
combining DEGs from multiple doses). Using DEGs present in at least
75% of the exposed/unexposed comparisons (that is, nine or more contrasts)
as cut-off, a group of 48 genes are identified (Figure 6). A cluster dendrogram of these genes, aligns
nanoparticle type and disease state along the dose–response
axis in a very similar manner to general transcriptome profiles, cell
death related genes and LDH assay. Response to transition metal nanoparticle
(FDR of 8 × 10–13) was identified as a highly
enriched pathway in this gene subset. This pathway was enriched by
a subset of type 1 metallothionein (MT1) genes, which are metal-binding
proteins long known to be involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification
in plants and animals,55 and more recently
have been identified to be highly deregulated in response to metal-based
nanoparticles.56−58 These 48 genes are outlined in Table 1.

Conclusion
Realistic
human-relevant in vitro models, combined
with focused in silico approaches, have the potential
to more reliably connect nanomaterial properties of concern to their
health hazards. A more complete understanding of how nanomaterials
can influence disease at the cellular and molecular level will enable
the incorporation of important population and exposure susceptibilities
into models. Here, via extensive comparative analysis
of 3D human bronchial epithelial model (MucilAir) exposed to air or
CuO-based aerosols, we show that existence of asthma enhances sensitivity
of the airways to nanoparticle aerosols, possibly as a combined result
of a hyperactive airway and inefficient mucociliary clearance mechanisms
in asthmatics. The observed enhanced susceptibility to nanoparticle
aerosols is of added relevance considering that asthmatic airway constriction
could not even be replicated in this air–liquid interface model.
Our data highlights the relevance of employing a generally applicable
air–liquid interface exposure system,20 in tandem with extensive transcriptomic characterization for health
hazard assessment. By focusing on highly overlapping differentially
expressed genes, we have also presented a concise list of candidate
biomarkers to adverse nCuO exposure, which by themselves were able
to incorporate particle surface chemistry and pre-existing asthma
into the dose–response gradient. This “core signature”,
which may be a combination of genes that represent tissue defense
and detoxification mechanisms and those involved in progression of
adverse exposure outcomes, can be used for human biomonitoring and
surveillance.

Materials and Methods
Experimental
Equipment
A schematic of the exposure
setup is shown in Figure 1. The equipment consists of an aerosol generator, an air–liquid
interface exposure system, and the MucilAir 3D human bronchial epithelial
model. See the work of Kooter et al.(10) for a comprehensive description of the equipment. Details
specific to the current experimental setup are previously described,10,20 with a few modifications that are outlined below.

Experimental
Design
The experimental assessment involved
exposures to clean, humidified air, low, middle, and high concentrations
of CuO and CuOCOOH. Cell material for the exposures originated
from five asthmatic and three healthy donors. The exposures were split
up as 1 h sessions, each consisting of a test block containing three
inserts. Parallel exposure sessions were carried out to assess, cytotoxicity,
cytokine release, and RNA isolation for microarray-based transcriptomics.
Each Vitrocell consists of three slots (inserts); thus, every time
a test block is exposed, the cell material within its three inserts
originates from a single donor only. There were in total three healthy
and five asthmatic donors, and the cell material of each donor was
tested once in each session, once in each test block, and once at
each CuO/CuOCOOH concentration.

Aerosol Generation
The test atmosphere was generated
by aerosolizing nano-CuO and nano-CuOCOOH, 10–20
nm primary particle size (average primary particle size, nm ca. 15;
BET, m2/g 55 ± 5, provided by NANOSOLUTIONS consortium). An air
control, a low-concentration, a mid-concentration, and a high-concentration
flow were realized simultaneously. The test atmosphere for the high-dose
group was extracted from the buffer chamber using a mass flow controller
(Bronkhorst Hi Tec B.V.) connected to a vacuum source. The test atmospheres
for the mid- and low-dose groups were diluted using an AirVac eductor
(AirVac Engineering Company). The incubator temperature was set to
37 °C, and relative humidity was controlled at 50% for each group
with a Testo RH/T device (Testo 635; Testo GmbH & Co).

Real-Life
Exposure Dose Extrapolation
The Vitrocell
system consists of a module that supports several inserts with adaptable
well sizes. Based on the current configuration, the total area of
an exposed insert is 0.3 cm2, the dose/area is given as
particle concentration in air (mg/m3) × deposition
rate × volume of air in chamber (dm3) ÷ insert surface area (cm2).10 The Vitrocell setup, aerosol flow rates, and exposure time are as
previously described.10 Thus, for a 14–15%
nanoparticle deposition rate, the effective dose per Vitrocell insert
for the low nCuOCOOH dose is 32 mg/m3 ×
0.14 × 0.09 dm3÷ 0.3 cm2 = 1.344 μg/cm2 (0.09 dm3 = 0.09
× 10–3 m3). For the purpose of simplicity,
we provide real-life exposure estimates that are based on the average
of the low, mid, and high doses of nCuO and nCuOCOOH nanoparticles
combined. Due to the fact that this MucilAir air–liquid interface
model replicates the conducting airways, the objective of the extrapolated
dose is to mimic real-life exposure of human bronchial airways. In
this region of the respiratory airways the modeled and measured deposition
rate of aerosols having an aerodynamic diameter of 1–2 μm
is estimated to be about 14%. The measured MMAD of aerosolized nCuOCOOH and nCuO particles in the buffer chamber (high dose) was
1.8 μm (geometric SD = 1.57) and 1.4 μm (geometric SD
= 1.48), respectively. In the absence of comprehensive real-life exposure
measurements, we extrapolated the in vitro exposures
to a time-weighted permissible exposure limit in an occupational setting
(see the Results and Discussion).

MucilAir3D
Human Bronchial Epithelial Model
MucilAir
fully differentiated bronchial epithelial models (Epithelix Sárl,
Geneva, Switzerland), reconstituted from primary human cells of healthy
or asthmatic donors, were used for air–liquid exposure to CuO
and CuOCOOH. The cells were maintained on 24-well Transwell
culture supports at an air–liquid interface using MucilAir
culture medium, supplemented with 1% amphotericin and 0.5% gentamicin,
in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Prior
to performing the experiments, the MucilAir cells were stabilized
in culture for at least 1 week, while the medium was refreshed every
2–3 days. The basolateral culture medium was refreshed approximately
24 h before exposure. The MucilAir cells were rinsed with saline solution
(0.9% NaCl, 1.25 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES buffer) approximately
24 h before and again just before exposure to ensure that each individual
model contained a mucus layer of comparable thickness. Right before
exposure, the insets were transferred to the exposure device. The
stainless-steel wells of the exposure device contained MucilAir culture
medium to feed the cell monolayer from the basal side during a 1 h
exposure. The duration of the exposure is based on our experience
with this model.10 Cells were stabilized
for another 24 h with 0.7 mL of MucilAir culture medium at the basal
site in a humidified incubator (ca. 37 °C, 5% CO2) after exposures.
Cell cultures were visually inspected under the microscope before
and after exposures to examine their status. The lower relative humidity
of 50% during the exposures compared to the in vivo situation is not affecting the cell model. Negative controls (nonexposed
in the humidified incubator, > 90%RH) and air exposed controls
show
both similar (absence of) cytotoxicity (figure1D), where particle exposed cells show a dose
response. Other studies by authors show that even exposure up to 6
h is feasible using this setup.59,60

Cellular Effects
LDH-based cytotoxicity assessment
(LDH-assay kit Roche, Mannheim, Germany), pro-inflammatory signaling
(multiple analyses of cytokine (MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-8) release - human
inflammation 20plex FlowCytomix Multiplex, Ebiosciences) and microarray-based
global transcriptome profiling, were performed on MucilAir cells that
had been cultured for 24 h post-nanoparticle exposure. The above-mentioned
cytokines were chosen because they were previously identified as upregulated in vitro following exposure to nanoparticles (CeO2,10,37 CuO20) in our
laboratory. Samples for analysis were taken from the basolateral medium
only. For direct comparison with mRNA expression measured from microarray
analysis, cytokine levels were log2 transformed. Error bars are mean
and standard deviation of three to five replicates, unless otherwise
specified. Two-way ANOVA (adjusted for multiple comparisons with Tukey’s
test) were performed for identification of statistically significant
differences in cellular cytotoxicity or cytokine release.

DNA Microarrays
Total RNA was isolated from cell lysates
with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Desalting of the samples was required
and thus, additional purification was performed by ethanol precipitation
with 3 M sodium acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington,
NC).61 Quantity and quality of the RNA
samples were assessed by NanoDrop and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. All samples passed the
quality threshold of RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8 and were included
in the DNA microarray analysis.

One hundred nanograms of each
independent RNA sample was used to synthesize cRNA with T7 RNA polymerase
amplification method (Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit, Agilent Technologies).
cRNAs were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes (Agilent Technologies) and
thereafter purified by using RNeasy Mini spin columns (Qiagen, GmbH,
Hilden, Germany). three hundred nanograms of a Cy3-labeled sample
and a Cy5-labeled sample were combined (total 600 ng), fragmented,
and hybridized to the Agilent 2-color 60-mer oligo arrays for 17 h
at 65 °C (Agilent SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression v3 GE 8
× 60K). The slides were washed and scanned with Agilent Microarray
Scanner G2505C (Agilent Technologies). Raw intensity values were obtained
with the Feature Extraction software, version 11.0.1.1 (Agilent Technologies).

All microarray data associated with this publication have been
deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus database62 and are accessible via GEO
series accession number GSE127773 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127773).

Data Preprocessing and Differential Expression Analyses
Processing of raw files and differential expression analysis were
carried out with eUTOPIA,63 a platform-independent graphical user interface based on R, with comprehensive workflows for gene expression analysis.
After importing raw files, signal intensity and background corrections
were performed by quantile normalization. Batch effects due to dye
and array were accounted for during differential expression analysis
by fitting the expression of each gene to a linear model (Limma64,65), with the exposures specified
as the “variable of interest”. A Benjamini–Hochberg
FDR of at most 5% and abs log2 difference ≥ 0.58 were the specified
cut-offs to consider a gene as significantly different between any
two contrasts.

Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical
clustering was
carried out with Perseus.66 Clustering parameters used were as follows; Distance: Euclidean,
Linkage: Average and Cluster Preprocessing: K-means. To improve the
differentiation accuracy and relevance of the generated clusters,
hierarchical clustering analyses was always performed on a specified
set of differentially expressed genes. The data matrix for cluster
generation was quantile-normalized, and batch effects due to dye and
array were adjusted with the ComBat(67) algorithm implemented in eUTOPIA.

Gene
Set Functional Enrichment Analysis
Gene ontology
(release date 2018-04-04) based identification of overrepresented
biological processes were carried out using PANTHER68 enrichment analysis tool. Scoring of significantly enriched
biological pathways was done by multiplying the fold enrichment by
the −log of the false discovery rate. Biological processes
with a < 1.5-fold enrichment and FDR ≥
0.001 were excluded. Alternatively, identification and visualization
of biological networks from predicted enriched gene functions were
done using the web-based GeneMANIA prediction server.69
