To investigate the performance of three-dimensional (3D)
nanostructures,
it is vital to study their internal structure with a methodology that
keeps the device fully functional and ready for further integration.
To this aim, we introduce here traceless X-ray tomography (TXT) that
combines synchrotron X-ray holographic tomography with high X-ray
photon energies (17 keV) in order to study nanostructures “as
is” on massive silicon substrates. The combined strengths of
TXT are a large total sample size to field-of-view ratio and a large
penetration depth. We study exemplary 3D photonic band gap crystals
made by CMOS-compatible means and obtain real space 3D density distributions
with 55 nm spatial resolution. TXT identifies why nanostructures that
look similar in electron microscopy have vastly different nanophotonic
functionality: one “good” crystal with a broad photonic
gap reveals 3D periodicity as designed; a second “bad”
structure without a gap reveals a buried void, and a third “ugly”
one without gap is shallow due to fabrication errors. Thus, TXT serves
to nondestructively differentiate between the possible reasons of
not finding the designed and expected performance and is therefore
a powerful tool to critically assess 3D functional nanostructures.

==== Body
Three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures
are drawing a fast-growing attention for their advanced functionalities
in nanophotonics,1−6 photovoltaics,7−9 and 3D integrated circuits and flash memories.10−12 The functional properties of such nanostructures are fundamentally
determined by their complex internal structure that consists of 3D
arrangements of structural units such as spheres, rods, pores, or
split rings.13 Inevitably, any fabricated
nanostructure differs from its initial design, systematically in the
case of structural deformations,14,15 and statistically
in the case of size and positional disorder of the structural units.16,17 Consequently, the observed functionality differs from the expected
one.

It is therefore critical to assess the structure of a 3D
nanomaterial
and verify how well it matches the design. Ideally, such an inspection
technique leaves no traces, keeping the nanostructure fully functional
and ready for integration. To this end, we introduce here traceless
X-ray tomography (TXT) as a methodology to the world of nanotechnology
in order to nondestructively assess the functionality of the nanostructures.
As a representative example, we study 3D periodic silicon photonic
band gap crystals made by complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS)-compatible methods (see Figure 1A).18,19 These nanostructures are powerful
tools to control the propagation and the emission of light by their
broad complete 3D photonic band gap20,21 (see Figure 1B). We observe that
TXT is ultimately limited only by the transmission loss of the X-ray
signal while propagating through the nanostructure and its substrate.
A transmission T > 10% is sufficient to preserve
good photon statistics and avoid artifacts. Therefore, with the X-ray
energy available with TXT (17 keV), massive sample–substrate
combinations can be investigated. In the case of silicon, the maximum
thickness is about 1.5 mm, sufficient for CMOS wafers. There are no
limitations to the internal geometry of the nanostructures under study
as periodic, random, or aperiodic structures can all be resolved.

Figure 1 Design
of a 3D photonic crystal and its photonic functionality.
(A) Cubic 3D inverse woodpile photonic crystals have a density distribution
designed as two perpendicular 2D centered rectangular arrays (lattice
parameters a, c; a/c = √2) of pores with radius r. Pores in the X-direction are aligned between pores
in the Z-direction.18 (B)
Band diagram for an inverse woodpile crystal made from silicon reveals
a broad 3D photonic band gap between a/λ =
0.60 and 0.75 (orange bar). In the experimentally probed Γ–X high-symmetry direction (panel 3× enlarged for clarity),
the s-polarized stop gap (yellow) is broader than the p-polarized
stop gap (black).21

Traditionally, in nanotechnology, a fabricated
sample is inspected
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).22 A major limitation of SEM, however, is that only the external surface
is viewed, whereas the inner structure remains hidden. Indeed, Figure 2 shows three 3D photonic
crystal nanostructures whose external surfaces look closely similar
and closely match the design in Figure 1A (for sample description see the Methods section). However, the corresponding nanophotonic
functionality shown in Figure 2 strongly differs: the crystal shown in panel A reveals a
broad photonic gap as designed (panel B), whereas the other two structures
reveal no gaps and instead a surprisingly constant reflectivity (panels
D and F; for the setup, see the Methods section).

of a 3D inverse woodpile photonic crystal made from Si whose measured
reflectivity spectrum (B) reveals a broad photonic gap in agreement
with theory with input from TXT (yellow range). Horizontal black bars
are estimated uncertainties in the TXT stop gap width. The blue range
is the stop gap estimated from SEM data. (C) SEM image of a 3D photonic
crystal whose reflectivity spectrum (D) reveals a constant low reflectivity
with no gap. (E) SEM image of a 3D photonic crystal whose reflectivity
spectrum (F) reveals a constant elevated reflectivity and no gap.
In (A,C,E), the scale bar is 1 μm.

Functional verification, such as optical reflectivity,
does not
provide insights into the reasons why the performance of samples differs
from design expectations. The reasons for different functional performance
may be hidden in errors of the fabrication process, in errors in the
design, or in errors of the functionality test itself. Therefore,
to differentiate fabrication or design errors from performance test
errors, it is necessary to know the actual 3D structure of the sample.
In case the internal structure indeed matches the design while simultaneously
the functionality differs from expectation, it is obvious that the
sample should remain intact in order to perform further functionality
studies, whence TXT.

To visualize 3D nanostructures, SEM is
supplemented with micromachining
or ion beam milling to cut away part of the structure.22 Unfortunately, however, this approach is destructive,
irreversible, and not in situ, hence packaged or
buried structures will inevitably be broken. Whereas transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) allows for high-resolution 3D imaging, the
required sample thickness of less than 1 μm is insufficient
for monolithic 3D photonic nanostructures.23 X-ray techniques are well-suited due to their high penetration and
high resolution.24,25 Although small-angle X-ray scattering
is employed to study 3D nanoparticle arrays, it naturally operates
in reciprocal space, making it hard to characterize local nanosized
features.26,27 In contrast, X-ray tomography yields a real
space 3D representation of the sample.28 In traditional tomography, the contrast is provided by the sample
absorption that is simply related to the brightness of the transmitted
image called a radiograph.29 As silicon
and many materials that prevail in nanotechnology and in the CMOS
industry absorb X-rays only weakly, however, advanced tomography methods
are required.

Here, we obtain the relevant real space structural
information
directly from the optical phase change of the X-ray beam that propagates
through the sample (for details, see the Methods section). The phase change is quantitatively retrieved from a set
of radiographs taken at multiple sample-to-detector distances while
rotating the sample.30 Following a conventional
tomographic reconstruction of the retrieved phase maps, the 3D electron
density ρe(X,Y,Z) is obtained in real space as a stack of equally spaced
2D slices in the plane normal to the sample’s rotation axis.
To achieve nanometer spatial resolution in a structure with millimeter
thick substrates that do not need to be cut away, we employ X-ray
holographic tomography with hard X-rays31 (see the Methods section). Its main features
are the X-ray beam that is focused and the sample that is placed at
a small distance zs downstream
from the focus to collect magnified Fresnel diffraction patterns on
the detector.

Figure 3A shows
a bird’s-eye view of the reconstructed sample volume of the
3D photonic crystal shown in Figure 2A,B. The YZ top face shows the surface
of the X-directed pores, similar to the SEM surface
in Figure 2A. The alignment
of the pores determines the 3D crystal structure and is a crucial
step in the nanofabrication. In practice, the alignment is controlled
by the etch mask for each pore array and by the directionality of
the etching processes.32 In the XZ side face in Figure 3A, pores are running in the Z-direction,
whereas in the XY front face, pores are running in
the X-direction, matching the 3D design of the inverse
woodpile structure (cf. Figure 1A), hence our nickname “the good”. In the XY front face, several pores appear as if they start “from
nowhere” in the middle, which is simply due to their running
slightly obliquely to the XY face (see Movie S2 and Movie S3), hence the top parts of the pores are not apparent.

Figure 3 3D tomographic reconstructions
of the three silicon nanostructures
shown in the SEM images in Figure 2. (A,C,E) Bird’s-eye views of the reconstructed
sample volumes, X-, Y-, and Z-axes are shown with each panel. (B,D,F) XZ cross sections taken midway through each sample; a 1 μm scale
bar is shown in each slice. The common scale bar in panel (B) gives
the electron density linearly interpolated between silicon (blue)
and air (red). Movies S1, S2, and S3 present animations of
the “good” sample shown in (A,B). Movie S4 presents cross sections of the “bad”
sample shown in (C,D), and Movie S5 presents
cross sections of the “ugly” sample shown in (E,F);
see Supporting Information.

Figure 3B shows
an XZ cross section midway through the 3D reconstructed
volume that cuts through both arrays of pores and allows us to determine
the maximum depths of both sets of pores (for YZ cross
sections as a function of X, see Movie S2). The Z pores have a depth D = 6280 ± 20 nm and a radius r =
183 ± 10 nm, corresponding to a state-of-the-art depth-to-diameter
aspect ratio of 17.15 ± 0.04, as expected from the deep reactive
ion etching settings.32,33 To date, the aspect ratio of
pores deeply etched in silicon could only be assessed destructively
and ex situ by SEM inspection of ion-milled slices
or cleaved cross sections.32,33 The deepest X pores have an even greater depth of 9460 ± 20 nm,
corresponding to a high aspect ratio of 25.8 ± 0.1. This is an
unequivocal observation that a second set of deep-etched pores runs
even deeper than a first set. As the pore depth is a main limitation
for a crystal’s size, 3D nanostructures are thus significantly
larger than expected before. Clearly, TXT reveals buried structural
features that are inaccessible to SEM or other nanocharacterization
methods (atomic force microscopy or scanning transmission microscopy),
as shown in Figure 3B, thus illustrating its power. Moreover, Figure 2B shows that the photonic gap estimated from
TXT structural data agrees much better with the measured reflectivity
stop band than the gap estimated from electron microscopy.

In
addition to characterizing functional nanostructures, TXT allows
one to identify several main deviations from the design that affect
functionality. Figure 3C,D shows a bird’s-eye view and a cross section through a
crystal whose external surface revealed usual crystalline features
on a SEM image (cf. Figure 2C). The TXT reconstruction, however, reveals a buried internal
void. The void is caused by stiction,34 that is, the structural collapse of a nanostructure due to capillary
action on the nanoscale due to the evaporation of a liquid. Here,
the liquid was a suspension of colloidal quantum dots that was infiltrated
in order to study spontaneous emission control20 and subsequently the liquid spontaneously evaporated from
the crystal. From TXT, we thus conclude that after the emission experiment,
the crystal lost its functionality as a photonic band gap device,
as is evident from the absence of a gap in reflectivity (see Figure 2D), and hence our
nickname “the bad”.

Figure 3E,F shows
a bird’s-eye view and a XZ cross section of
a third sample whose external surface revealed usual periodic pore
arrays in a SEM image (see Figure 2E). The tomographic reconstruction reveals a structure
with pores that appear to be surprisingly shallow (about 70 nm in
cross section) due to inadvertent erroneous settings during the etching
process, hence our nickname “the ugly”. Thus, TXT allows
us to conclude why this peculiar structure has no band gap functionality
to begin with, as is apparent from the lack of gap in reflectivity
(see Figure 2F), and
the higher constant reflectivity (compared to Figure 2D) is obviously caused by the presence of
bulk silicon.

One key feature of our TXT study is the use of
X-rays with a much
higher photon energy than before,35−37 namely, 17 keV (compared
to 6 or 8 keV). Therefore, the 1/e attenuation length
for silicon is here 640 μm, that is, 9 to 20× greater than
before, and sufficient to traverse wafer-thick silicon substrates
that are ubiquitous in the CMOS industry. Therefore, we have been
able to study nanostructures embedded in massive substrates with cross
sections up to 1.07 × 106 μm2 “as
is” without the need for irreversible sample preparation. In
contrast, in recent papers, samples had to be destructively milled
to a much smaller size36 or had to be doped
with heavy elements in order to obtain sufficient contrast.35

To characterize the TXT method, we define
as a figure of merit F the ratio between the total
linear sample size including
substrate and the linear field of view (see Table 1). Due to the high photon energy and the
holographic tomography method used here, we arrive at F = 86 (see Table 1), even without the need for extra data. In contrast, other interior
or local tomography methods such as Fresnel zone plate or ptychography38 have a limited F ≤ 3.3,
while also requiring extra data taken with some empty beam next to
the sample. In 2D ptychography of an integrated circuit,39 the sample had to be thinned to 10 μm
to allow sufficient X-ray transmission. On the contrary, a large F, as is demonstrated here, allows one to nondestructively
study CMOS-compatible nanostructures “as is” and allows
subsequent integration or fabrication steps.

Conclusion
We have performed X-ray holographic tomography
of 3D silicon photonic
band gap crystals on massive substrates as a generic demonstration
of traceless X-ray tomography of 3D nanomaterials. The method is truly
traceless since we successfully recorded optical spectra even after
the X-ray experiments. We obtain the 3D electron density and observe
that the structural design is faithfully realized and leads to photonic
functionality as expected. We uncover several buried structural deviations
that help to identify the lack of functionality of faulty structures.
We thus conclude that TXT is a powerful tool to assess the functionality
of any complex 3D functional nanostructure with arbitrary short or
long-range order, and allowing any subsequent integration or fabrication
steps.

Methods
3D Photonic Crystal Nanofabrication
The CMOS-compatible
fabrication process of our 3D photonic band gap crystals was described
previously.32,40,41 In brief, in our first generation of photonic crystals, a hard mask
is defined on a silicon wafer (thickness up to 0.73 mm) with a centered
rectangular array of apertures, with a pore radius r/a = 0.245 that gives the broadest possible band
gap.15 Deep reactive ion etching of the
first set of deep pores (in the Z-direction) results
in a wafer with a large 2D array of deep pores.32 Next, such a wafer is cleaved and polished and cut to a
millimeter width to fit in the etching machine to perform the second
etching step in the perpendicular direction. The second hard mask
is carefully aligned with respect to the first array of pores40 and defined in a 10 × 10 μm2 area on the side face of the wafer. By etching the second set of
pores in the X-direction, the 3D nanostructure is
obtained in the volume where both sets of pores overlap (see Figure 3 and the Movies S1–S3). Finally, the hard mask is removed. 3D photonic crystals shown
in Figure 3A–D
are fabricated in the above-mentioned way and are sitting on massive
chips with large cross sections up to 0.73 × 1.46 = 1.07 mm2.

In our second generation of photonic crystals, the
etch mask is deposited in a single step on both faces of a wafer edge,41 followed by deep reactive ion etching of two
perpendicular arrays of pores. As substrates, we employ Si beams that
are chemically etched to cross sections of 0.5 × 0.5 mm2 to obtain exactly perpendicular crystal surfaces. The 3D photonic
crystal shown in Figure 3E,F is an example of a second generation photonic crystal fabricated
with the single-step etch mask. Although this particular sample was
unsuccessful, this fabrication route has yielded many successful samples
that have the intended 3D nanostructure, as confirmed by X-ray tomography
(see Figure 4). Details
of all samples are listed in Table 1.

Figure 4 shows photographs

instrument “as is”, thus illustrating the power of TXT.
The silicon-beam-shaped substrate measures 0.5 × 0.5 × 10
mm3 and is shown after fabrication in the MESA+ NanoLab
(www.utwente.nl/mesaplus/nanolab) and mounted for X-ray holographic tomography scans at the ESRF.
We emphasize that we do not mill a specific area out of the sample
using, for instance, focused ion beams (FIB), as is used with other
imaging techniques that require small sample volumes, such as X-ray
ptychography, TEM, FIB-SEM, and so forth. We have successfully mounted
all samples characterized by X-ray holographic tomography at ESRF
in optical setups in Twente without further modifications and even
in the same sample holder.

X-ray Holographic Tomography
Holographic tomography
experiments were performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(ESRF), on the nanoimaging beamline ID16A-NI.42 The hard X-ray beam with 17 keV photon energy propagates in the Z-direction and is focused with multilayer coated Kirkpatrick-Baez
optics to a 23 × 37 nm2 focus. The sample is placed
at a small distance zs downstream from
the focus, and the detector is placed at a distance zd downstream from the sample, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 (Top) Scheme of the synchrotron
X-ray holotomography setup. The
incident X-ray beam is focused using Kirkpatrick-Baez optics into
a 23 × 37 nm2 focus. The sample is placed at a small
distance zs downstream from the focus,
and the detector is placed at a distance zd. Radiographs (one example shown) are recorded while rotating the
sample by angle θ. (Bottom) Animation of tomography: data are
recorded while rotating the sample (two orientations shown). From
the recorded radiographs, the tomographic reconstruction is derived
that is shown in the background.

The image recorded in the detector plane is an
in-line Gabor hologram
or Fresnel diffraction pattern.43 Due to
the focusing, the sample is illuminated with a spherical wave, unlike
the plane-wave illumination in traditional tomography. According to
the Fresnel scaling theorem, the spherical wave illumination gives
rise to an effective propagation distance D and a
magnification M given by44,45 1  Varying the focus-to-sample
distance zs allows us to vary the magnification M of the diffraction patterns. It also strongly modifies
the Fresnel diffraction pattern recorded on the detector through the
effective propagation distance. For a phase periodic object, such
as our photonic band gap crystals, the Talbot effect results in zero
contrast for certain spatial frequencies at the characteristic Talbot
distances.46 To obtain nonzero contrast
at all spatial frequencies, data are taken at four distances zs. The first distance was chosen to obtain a
desired pixel size, either 10 or 20 nm (see Table 1). At each distance zs, Ni = 1500 images
were recorded with 0.3 s exposure time while rotating the sample from
θ = 0 to 180° around the Y-axis of the
crystal (see Figure 2). After each set of rotations, additional radiographs at angles
θ = 0 and 90° were collected that revealed that no irreversible
changes occurred in the sample during the experiments. The number
of projections Ni was
chosen as a practical compromise between limited measurement time
and sufficient spatial resolution, whereas the total sample size including
substrate would require on the order of 105 projections
in theory, our figure of merit F decrease this number
by 2 orders of magnitude. For the tomographic scans, the axis of rotation
was aligned to be a few micrometers deep inside the silicon.

X-ray Data Processing
The data processing is a two-step
procedure consisting of a phase retrieval step followed by a tomographic
reconstruction. The phase retrieval aims at retrieving the amplitude A(x,y) and phase ϕ(x,y) of the wave exiting the sample u0 = A(x,y)eiϕ(x,y) and that are given by 2  and 3  where λ is the X-ray
wavelength. The amplitude and phase are thus the projection of, respectively,
the absorption index β and the refractive index decrement δ
that determine the complex refractive index for hard X-rays 4  Prior to phase retrieval,
all sets of radiographs are scaled to the same magnification and mutually
aligned. The mutual alignment of the radiographs at different distances
is perturbed by the out-of-focus information on the thick samples.
This problem is alleviated by refining this alignment iteratively
using the calculated radiographs of the iterative phase retrieval
step as a reference and aligning the experimental radiographs with
respect to this reference.

We determine a first estimate of
the amplitude and phase using the approach proposed by Paganin et al.,47 extended to multiple
distances. We assume a homogeneous ratio δ/β = 174 for
silicon at 17 keV photon energy. This first estimate provides a blurred
version of the phase map. The map is recursively improved using 15
iterations of a nonlinear least-squares optimization. Due to the interior
tomography problem, the boundary conditions are unknown in the phase
retrieval step and the tomography reconstruction. The padding of the
images—required in the propagation operators—and the
filter step of the FBP tomography reconstruction are done as follows:
The image at the largest distance (largest field of view) with an
original size of 2048 (h) × 2048 (v) pixels is resampled to the highest magnification and 3216 ×
3216 pixels. This image is padded to a size of 6144 × 4096 pixels
by extending the boundary values with a smooth cosinus-type transition
from one edge to the other. The images at higher magnification (and
smaller field of view) are padded with the image data from the next
lower magnification. The absence of any discontinuities in the padded
images obtained in this way is effective to minimize the artifacts
in the final reconstruction without the use of any supplementary data.
The phase retrieval was carried out with ESRF in-house software using
the GNU Octave programming environment (www.octave.org) and the public
domain image analysis program ImageJ (see http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij).

Second, a standard tomographic reconstruction48 based on the filtered back-projection algorithm49 and implemented in the ESRF software PyHST250 allows us to obtain the distribution of the
refractive index decrement δ(x, y, z). As the X-ray energy of 17 keV is far above
any absorption edge of the materials under study, we obtain the electron
density distribution from the well-known expression 5  with re is the classical electron radius.51 The resulting structure was rendered with open-source software ParaView
(see www.paraview.org).

Some phase projections are singular as the phase varies tremendously
over a short distance when the X-rays are parallel to a sample face:
1.5 mm of Si introduces 216 rad phase shift at 17 keV. Therefore,
about 10 projections near these singular angles (parallel to the X- or Z-directions) are omitted from the
tomographic reconstruction.

In our nanostructures, the surrounding
material introduces additional
contrast that compounds the data interpretation, notably unpolished
wafer backsurfaces with micron-high step sizes, sample corners, as
well as surrounding deep 2D photonic crystal structures (some of these
features are apparent in Movies S2 and S3). Fortunately, our method is sufficiently
robust so that the structural features of the photonic crystals are
clearly visible with sufficient spatial resolution.

Spatial Resolution
To investigate the spatial resolution,
we inspected cross sections of reconstructed data within the large
void of the “bad” sample as this structure presents
several air–silicon interfaces. One line profile across an
interface is shown as refractive index decrement in Figure 6. By modeling the data with
a smooth curve and taking the derivative, we arrive at a full width
at half-maximum resolution of 55 nm, corresponding to two-and-a-half
20 nm pixels.

Figure 6 Line profile across an air–Si interface in the
“bad”
sample shown as refractive index decrement (red circles). From the
drawn curve, we derive a resolution of 55 nm.

Nanophotonic Experiments and Theory
To assess the basic
functionality of the photonic crystals, we performed optical reflectivity
to probe the designed photonic gaps. Optical reflectivity was measured
using a home-built microscope setup that employs reflective optics
and operates in the near-infrared range at wavelengths beyond 800
nm, see refs (52) and (53) and Supporting Information. Photonic band structures were calculated
with the plane-wave expansion method, using the MIT photonic bands
(MPB) code.54 Silicon was modeled with
a dielectric function ϵ = 12.1; see Supporting Information for further details.
