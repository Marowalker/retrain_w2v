Kagome lattices are
structures possessing fascinating magnetic
and vibrational properties, but in spite of a large body of theoretical
work, experimental realizations and investigations of their dynamics
are scarce. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and density
functional theory calculations, we study the vibrational properties
of two-dimensional silica (2D-SiO2), which has a kagome
lattice structure. We identify the signatures of crystalline and amorphous
2D-SiO2 structures in Raman spectra and show that, at finite
temperatures, the stability of 2D-SiO2 lattice is strongly
influenced by phonon–phonon interaction. Our results not only
provide insights into the vibrational properties of 2D-SiO2 and kagome lattices in general but also suggest a quick nondestructive
method to detect 2D-SiO2.

==== Body
The kagome
lattice1 has long been a model system for
theoretical
studies of various physical properties, primarily magnetism, in systems
with particular topology, as it exhibits spin frustration when interactions
are antiferromagnetic on a triangular lattice. The mechanical properties
of such systems are also of interest.2−4 It was theoretically
shown that if the kagome lattice consists of rigid triangles that
interact only through their direct links (nearest-neighbor interaction),
the system becomes isostatic, which means it is on the border of mechanical
instability, since compression of the lattice in this case would lead
to rotations of the triangles, as shown in Figure 1d, at no cost in energy. Two-dimensional
silica (2D-SiO2) has attracted attention, as it is one
of the thinnest insulating materials which can be used in catalysis
and for isolating graphene from metal substrates, making vertical
heterostructures5−9 that can be transferred between substrates.10 However, in spite of the substantial progress in its synthesis,
little is known about vibrational properties of this 2D system and
its Raman spectra. Moreover, it is desirable to have a quick nondestructive
technique, such as Raman spectroscopy (RS) to identify this material.

(b) Top view of the structure indicating the unit cell of the hexagonal P6/mmm lattice and (c) its interpretation

(d) A rotated kagome lattice, which is the ground state of 2D-SiO2 under compressive strain at zero temperature.11

Here we show that the crystalline 2D-SiO2 structure
represents a kagome lattice. Using a combination of Raman spectroscopy
and first-principles calculations, we perform an in-depth investigation
of the lattice dynamics and find that the stability of 2D-SiO2 is strongly influenced by phonon–phonon interaction
at finite temperatures. We further demonstrate that there is a characteristic
signature of 2D silica in RS, so that this technique, along with infrared
spectroscopy,5 can be used for a quick
identification of the material.

Results and Discussion
The optical image in Figure 2a shows a section of a TEM grid covered with graphene (details
of methods are given in the Supporting Information). The additional layer deposited on top of graphene, well visible
in the optical image, is 2D-SiO2. The Raman spectrum measured
in the middle of the area displayed in Figure 2a is presented in Figure 2d (larger version in Figure S1). It shows the prominent G, D, and 2D peaks, three
well-known signatures of graphene. A peak intensity ratio IG/I2D close to 1
and full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the 2D peak reaching 50 cm–1 indicate that bi- or trilayer graphene covers the
TEM grid in that region. The spectrum baseline mainly results from
an amorphous carbon membrane (Quantifoil) covering the TEM gold grid
with a typical broad background between 1300 and 1600 cm–1. Apart from the graphene features, a distinctive, very narrow (fwhm
20 cm–1) peak at 1045 cm–1 is
apparent in the spectrum.

bars on the right of the Raman maps refer to values in Z direction: For peak position maps, in (b) the center mark stands
for value 2710 cm–1 and in (e) for 1045 cm–1. The extreme dark and bright colors represent ±30 cm–1 deviation from these values. In the intensity map of 2710 cm–1 peak (c), the counts vary from 0 (dark) to 40 ×
103 (bright), and in the intensity map of 1045 cm–1 peak (e), the counts vary from 0 (dark) to 1400 (bright).

In order to localize the origin
of this peak that cannot be assigned
to graphene, mapping of Raman spectra in the displayed area was performed. Figure 2b,c shows Raman maps
of the peak position and peak intensity of the graphene 2D band at
2710 cm–1. Except for the left upper corner, the
brown-colored area shows graphene homogeneously spread over the rest
of the square. Raman maps of the peak position and intensity of the
feature at 1045 cm–1 are displayed in Figure 2e,f. Here the area where the
1045 cm–1 mode is missing (white, in Figure 2e) is larger than the area
where the 2D band of graphene is not present.

In the next step,
the same sample area was investigated by HR-TEM.
A mosaic composed of dark-field TEM images of the individual holes
in the same area of the TEM grid previously studied by Raman mapping
is displayed in Figure 2g. For the HR-TEM structural study, we chose a particular position
on the grid marked here by a red circle. Imaging the area inside the
red circle in Figure 2h in dark-field shows inhomogeneous brighter and darker regions decorated
with small white particles. Zooming in even more, the atomic structure
obtained in HR-TEM mode and displayed in Figure 2i confirms that the deposited layer on graphene
indeed contains 2D-SiO2, as described in our previous works.12

A magnification of the range 400–1500
cm–1 (Figure 3a) reveals
that, in addition to the intensive narrow mode at 1045 cm–1, there are also much weaker peaks at 409, 454, 500, and 715 cm–1. Even though there are reports on the Raman active
mode at 1045 cm–1 in several bulk systems that contained
Si–O–Si bonds,13−15 it is not clear how this can
be related to the significantly different 2D structure of 2D-SiO2. The origin of this mode in bulk systems had long been under
dispute, and finally, it was assigned to a Si–O–Si stretching
mode, when oxygen bridges silicon atoms with an angle of 180°.
This interpretation seems to be possible also in our bilayer silica,
since Si–O–Si forms a straight line in the planar structure.

Figure 3 Experimental
Raman spectrum (a) and calculated phonon DOS (b) and
phonon dispersion graphs (c) for 2D-SiO2. The positions
of optically active modes at the Γ point are marked with arrows
in the calculated spectrum, including two IR modes, allowing for identification
of experimental modes by correlation to those calculated from DFT
(indicated by blue lines between panels (a) and (b)). The inset in
(a) shows the antisymmetric bond stretch mode responsible for the
prominent peak at 1045 cm–1. The modes colored red,
blue, and green in (c) are kagome lattice modes discussed in detail
in relation to Figure 4.

In order to ascertain the origin
of the measured Raman modes in
2D-SiO2, the vibrational properties were investigated by
DFT calculations. Figure 3a,b compares the measured Raman spectrum with the phonon density
of states (DOS) in the interval containing the vibrational modes seen
in the experiments, with arrows marking the optically active modes
at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone (Table S1). There is a good agreement for the conspicuous peak at
1045 cm–1. This corresponds to the calculated Raman
active E1g mode at 1053 cm–1, an asymmetric
bond stretching mode illustrated as an inset in Figure 3a.

With the exception of the bond stretching
E1g mode,
the calculations appear to consistently underestimate the vibrational
frequencies by approximately 8–10%, and a systematic underestimate
was also noted by Löffler for calculated IR frequencies.5 With this systematic error, the overall agreement
is reasonably good, and it allows us to identify and assign symmetry
labels for the observed modes as A1g (409 cm–1), E1g (454 cm–1), E2g (500
cm–1), A2u (715 cm–1, IR), E1g (1045 cm–1), and A2u (1317 cm–1, IR). Two Raman active modes at 791
and 829 cm–1 are absent in the experiments, presumably
too weak to be visible. The assignment of formally Raman inactive
IR modes in the spectrum is somewhat counterintuitive, but IR modes
have been previously reported in Raman spectra due to breaking of
inversion symmetry, which may be caused by the sample geometry of
thin films,16 a 2D material being put on
a substrate,17 or by disorder.18 We furthermore note that previous IR spectra
reported by Löffler et al. for an “oxidized”
sample5 similarly shows a small feature
in the absorption near 1050 cm–1, indicating that
the most prominent Raman peak seen here may also be present in IR
spectra.

To further investigate this symmetry breaking, we also
performed
calculations for two haeckelite structures, previously investigated
in the context of the formation of the vitreous phase of 2D-SiO2.19 These structures are formed
by performing a Stone–Wales transformation in the smallest
possible unit cell, to produce 2D crystal structures with a linkage
different from the honeycomb lattice of the pristine system. Here,
the haeckelite structures function as minimal prototypes of the disordered
vitreous phase, or at least a phase where SiO4 tetrahedra
are connected at different angles. The analysis shows that the phonon
DOS’s in the haecklites are very similar to that of the pristine
system (see Figure S4) and so do not provide
direct help in ascertaining the degree of disorder from the Raman
spectra. Inspection of the modes at the Γ point shows that the
two IR modes retain the same character in the haeckelites as in the
pristine system. The asymmetric bond-stretch mode at 1045 cm–1 is found to correspond to a set of similar modes, which nevertheless
somewhat hybridize with other modes (see Supporting Information Movie M1 and discussion in SI section IV). For other modes, such as the three-peak feature
between 400 and 500 cm–1, no clear correspondence
to specific modes in the haeckelite structures is possible to identify
by inspection. We conclude that the two IR modes are universal features
of the bilayer silica structure irrespective of disorder of the ring
arrangement, which is in agreement with previous analyses.5 The asymmetric bond-stretch mode is also to be
expected in all cases, but some broadening of the peak should occur
in the vitreous phase, as also seen in bulk structures.15 As for other modes identified in the pristine
structure, a gradual broadening of the peaks should always be present
upon going toward more disorder, but within the present analysis,
we are not able to quantify the effect with sufficient precision to
ascertain whether the three-peak structure at 400–500 cm–1 is a uniquely defining feature of the pristine, hexagonal
2D-SiO2 lattice or if it will also be present in the vitreous
phase. The possibility of using these peaks as a measure of disorder
in the sample, in a manner similar to the D peak
in graphene,20 could be further investigated
with access to samples with larger well-defined areas of pristine
and vitreous phases of 2D-SiO2.

The calculated phonon
spectrum of pristine 2D-SiO2 is
shown in Figure 3c
and is in fair agreement with the previous results of Zhou et al.21 The most important difference
concerns the low-energy part of the spectrum, which in ref (21) contained an unstable
mode, the lowest mode along the Γ-M path in Figure 3c. This is an important
mode from the point of view of the stability of the lattice, since
it is one of the modes that can be directly attributed to the dynamics
of the kagome lattice. A magnified view of the low-energy phonon spectrum
of Figure 3c is displayed
in Figure 4a, related to rotations of the triangular building
blocks of the kagome lattice, illustrated in Figure 1d. Souslov et al.2 analyzed these modes, explaining that the kagome
mode at highest energy at the Γ point (in green) comes from
rigid rotations of the triangular units, the B2u mode shown
as inset in Figure 3a and in Figure S2b. Due to the bilayer
structure of 2D-SiO2, at the Γ point, this mode is
degenerate with the B1g mode in which the two kagome lattices
rotate in opposite directions (Figure S2c). The B2u mode hybridizes with one of the acoustic branches
(red), so that the rotational motion of the B2u is dominating
the lowest-lying, red, branch at the M point.

Figure 4 (a) Magnification
of the low-energy part of the phonon dispersion
graph in Figure 3(c),
illustrating the kagome lattice modes described by Souslov et al.2,3 (b) Total energy as a function
of the phonon normal mode coordinate, ξ, of the B2u phonon mode for a series of biaxial strains. The figure shows only
positive values of ξ, but the symmetry of the mode, shown as
an inset, means that the curve is symmetric around zero. At zero temperature,
the lattice immediately becomes unstable with respect to this displacement
under compression, since the curve becomes a double well.

It was previously noted that the 2D-SiO2 lattice under
compression “folds up”, with the oxygen tetrahedra rotating
to accommodate the compressive strain,11 thus forming a twisted kagome lattice as shown in Figure 1d. In the context of crystal
vibrations, this can be expressed as the B1u mode becoming
unstable under compressive strain. Figure 4b explicitly shows the energy dependence
on the B1u normal mode coordinate, ξ, for a series
of strains, and we can clearly see that the energy minimum is shifted
away from zero, which corresponds to the nontwisted kagome lattice.
We also note that the curve is very flat already at zero strain, hard
to fit to a second degree polynomial, which indicates that anharmonic
effects are important already in the ground state of the crystal.
Anharmonicity leads to phonon–phonon interaction which at finite
temperatures may serve to stabilize the crystal lattice.22 To investigate finite temperature effects as
a possible source of the discrepancy between calculated and experimental
frequencies and also to gain further insights in the stability of
the 2D-SiO2 system, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations at a temperature of 300 K
for a series of biaxial strains. The AIMD trajectories obtained were
then used to extract finite temperature effective force constant matrices
with the TDEP method,23,24 to see finite-temperature effects
on the vibrational spectrum.

Figure 5 illustrates
the results of the AIMD calculations, showing particle trajectories
and phonon spectra at ε = 0 and for two compressive strains.
From the AIMD trajectories, it is clear that the atoms spread out
significantly around their average positions as the lattice is compressed,
but that the average positions are those of the undistorted structure,
with no apparent rotation of the tetrahedra. The oxygen atom trajectories
form distributions which is not spherically symmetric around an average
position, but rather ellipsoidal in shape, spreading out in the direction
perpendicular to the Si–O–Si bond. This corresponds
to a significant occupation of phonon modes that rotate the oxygen
tetrahedra. These rotational modes become stabilized by phonon–phonon
interactions so that the free energy surface at room temperature remains
a minimum at the B2u normal mode coordinate ξ = 0
(inset of Figure 4b),
in contrast to the 0 K result shown in Figures 4b and 5d.

Figure 5 AIMD trajectories
at a temperature of 300 K for compressive strains
of 0%, 1%, and 2% (a–c), corresponding phonon spectra at temperatures
of 0 K (d–f) and 300 K (g–i). The molecular dynamics
trajectories show the structure in top view with Si atoms in blue,
O atoms in red and green circles centered on the average atomic positions.
The phonon spectra show the kagome modes in red and green immediately
collapsing on compression at 0 K in (e) and (f). At room temperature,
the kagome mode structure remains intact (g) and (h), with destabilization
instead setting in at the M point at strains above
about 2% (i).

This stability is explicitly
demonstrated by effective phonon dispersion
plots, shown in Figure 5d–i. At zero compressive strain (ε = 0, Figure 5d,g), the spectra at 0 and
300 K are very similar, indicating that anharmonic effects are fairly
small. At ε = −1%, Figure 5e shows that the kagome lattice collapses at 0 K. The
two kagome modes that consist of rigid rotations of tetrahedra, shown
in green and red, will merge into a single unstable mode at the Γ
point. This results in the modes that extend to unphysical negative
frequencies in Figure 5e,f, where the signature kagome modes are no longer present. By contrast, Figure 5h clearly shows the
kagome modes remaining clearly identifiable at 300 K, stabilized by
phonon–phonon interactions at finite temperature. At ε
= −2% Figure 5I shows that the lattice does become unstable also at 300 K, but
the distortion is not the simple rotation of the kagome lattice given
by the B2u mode at the Γ point, but through the lowest,
flat kagome mode, shown in red in Figure 4a, and at the M point. This
indicates that the distortion at finite temperature should involve
a doubling of the unit cell along one of the axes and not be very
large, a fact corroborated by the AIMD trajectories, which cannot
show this small distortion on the time scale of the simulation. We
also note that the softening of the phonon mode is much less drastic
than is the case at 0 K, showing that the lattice is significantly
stabilized at finite temperature. At sufficiently large compressive
strain, about ε = −4%, the depth of the potential wells
overcomes the thermal fluctuations. As a result, the kagome lattice
folds up into a locked configuration (Figure S3), and the atoms become much more localized near their equilibrium
positions.

Thus, the kagome lattice is stabilized at finite
temperature by
the inclusion of phonon–phonon interactions from the anharmonic
potential induced by the compression. This stabilization mechanism
is quite different from that earlier proposed for colloidal particles
on a surface, based on a coarse-grained model that introduces the
bending angle rigidity as a purely entropic term.25 While such a picture may be valid for weakly interacting
particles on a surface, where entropic contributions can be expected
to dominate over direct interaction terms, it is clearly not applicable
for the strongly bonded 2D-SiO2. The introduction of a
bending rigidity as a purely entropic contribution to the free energy
makes it proportional to the temperature, which leads to an unstable
lattice in the low-temperature limit, in clear contradiction with
our 0 K results. Our results furthermore show that anharmonicity results
in qualitative changes of the vibrational structure and is not a simple
renormalization of the frequencies, as assumed by Mao et al.25 A critical reexamination of the vibrational
properties of the previously studied self-assembled polymer networks
thus seems warranted.

At higher energies in the spectrum, the
phonon DOS, including the
optically active modes at the Γ point, is not significantly
affected by temperature, so the underestimation of the calculated
vibrational frequencies cannot be explained by anharmonic or other
finite temperature effects. We suggest that the source may be that
the lattice is stiffened by grain boundaries and other defects, which
will locally lock and constrain the tetrahedra.19

Conclusions
In summary, using Raman spectroscopy and
HR-TEM, we have identified
several previously uncharacterized vibrational states of 2D-SiO2, which have been assigned through comparison to DFT calculated
spectra. These results enable Raman spectroscopy to be used as a quick
and nondestructive method to identify the 2D-SiO2 bilayer.
The analysis indicates that these modes may be possible to use also
to study the amount of disorder in the material, but further study
is required for precise quantification of the effect. Our calculations
also allow us to identify the phonon modes typical of a kagome lattice,
and AIMD simulations reveal that the kagome lattice stability is strongly
affected by phonon–phonon interactions at finite temperature.
This provides fundamental insights into the structural stability and
properties of 2D-SiO2 as well as kagome lattices in general.

Methods and Materials
Computational Methods
Phonon spectra were calculated
with the direct supercell method using the programs PHON26 and PHONOPY,27 with
force constant matrices computed numerically with the Vienna ab initio simulation package28,29 and the projector-augmented
wave method.30,31 Supercells of size 6 × 6
× 1 were used in the force constant generation. A basis set cutoff
of 800 eV for plane waves was used together with a k-space mesh of 12 × 12 × 1 for Brillouin zone integration
of the primitive cells, and on a 2 × 2 × 1 mesh for the
supercells, meaning that the supercell calculations were done on a k-point set equivalent to that used in the relaxation of
the primitive cell. The electronic self-consistent field cycle was
re-iterated until changes in energy were smaller than 10–8 eV, and the structure was relaxed until the maximal force on any
atom was smaller than 0.001 eV/Å2.

AIMD simulations
were carried out in 5 × 5 × 1 supercells using a k-point mesh only containing the Γ point and with
a basis set cutoff of 300 eV. Calculations were done at 300 K by first
equilibrating the system for about 1000 time steps in an NVE ensemble
run and then continuing at fixed temperature with a Nosé–Hoover
thermostat for approximately 10,000 time steps. Finite temperature
phonon spectra were obtained from the molecular dynamics trajectories
using the TDEP method of Hellman et al.23,24

Sample Preparation
Graphene films were prepared with
a low-pressure CVD technique using hexane as a precursor on polycrystalline
Cu foils. The Cu foil was attached to a quartz substrate, which itself
was placed into a quartz tube. The tube was pumped down to a pressure
of 10–2 mbar. Then, forming gas (Ar/(5%)H2) was introduced
at a pressure of 5 mbar, and under these conditions, the Cu foil was
heated up to 950 °C. When the desired temperature was achieved,
the forming gas flow was interrupted, and hexane vapor was introduced
into the quartz tube instead under a pressure of 0.5 mbar for 1 min.
Finally, the sample was cooled down to room temperature under the
flow of forming gas at a pressure of 5 mbar. The formation of a 2D
layer of silica is attributed to an unintentional leakage of air into
the quartz tube when switching from forming gas to hexane. This would
cause the oxidation of the copper surface and a reaction with the
quartz substrate at the contact surface with the oxidized copper.
Albeit uncontrolled, these conditions seem sufficient to form the
2D layer of silica.

Transfer on TEM Grid
Graphene/silica
films were transferred
from the copper substrate by etching in 15% nitric acid and fishing
the floating film (without polymer support) onto commercial TEM grids
(Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 holey carbon film on Au 200 mesh). Afterward,
the specimen was rinsed in distilled water dried in dry nitrogen.
Prior to TEM, the samples were heated in air to 200 °C for 10
min.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman measurements were performed
with a scanning confocal setup where the laser beam of a solid state
laser with a wavelength of 488 nm and a power of 7 mW was circularly
polarized and focused to a diffraction-limited spot size of approximately
400 nm. While the position of the laser spot is fixed, the sample
is raster scanned on a grid with a step size of 200 nm. At each position,
the backscattered light is dispersed in a monochromator and detected
with a Peltier cooled charge coupled device (CCD) with an accumulation
time of 1 s.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM experiments were
performed with an image-side corrected FEI Titan 80–300 microscope
operated at 80 kV. The spherical aberration was set to approximately
20 μm, and the energy spread of the source was reduced by lowering
the extraction voltage to 2 kV. Dark-field imaging was a versatile
tool to visualize details in the deposited layer at low and high magnifications.
