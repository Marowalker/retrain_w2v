Surface
nanotopography is widely employed to control cell behavior
and in particular controlled disorder has been shown to be important
in cell differentiation/maturation. However, extracellular matrix
proteins, such as fibronectin (FN), initially adsorbed on a biomaterial
surface are known to mediate the interaction of synthetic materials
with cells. In this work, we examine the effect of nanotopography
on cell behavior through this adsorbed layer of adhesive proteins
using a nanostructured polycarbonate surface comprising 150 nm-diameter
pits originally defined using electron beam lithography. We address
the effect of this nanopitted surface on FN adsorption and subsequently
on cell morphology and behavior using C2C12 myoblasts. Wettability
measurements and atomic force microscopy imaging showed that protein
is adsorbed both within the interpits spaces and inside the nanopits.
Cells responded to this coated nanotopography with the formation of
fewer but larger focal adhesions and by mimicking the pit patterns
within their cytoskeleton, nanoimprinting, ultimately achieving higher
levels of myogenic differentiation compared to a flat control. Both
focal adhesion assembly and nanoimprinting were found to be dependent
on cell contractility and are adversely affected by the use of blebbistatin.
Our results demonstrate the central role of the nanoscale protein
interface in mediating cell-nanotopographical interactions and implicate
this interface as helping control the mechanotransductive cascade.

==== Body
A wide variety
of biological
cells organize their surface structures in relation to the topographical
features of the surface to which they adhere.1−5 Cells respond to growing on a nanostructured surface
by changes in adhesion, cytoskeletal organization and other cellular
activities, e.g., expression of a desired phenotype.1,5−8 It is believed that focal adhesions (FAs) underlie these cellular
reactions to nanofeatures. For instance, focal adhesion size is altered
in mesenchymal stem cells relative to underlying nanopatterned substrates:
adhesion length and number decrease on highly ordered arrays allowing
prolonged stem cell self-renewal and adding a small degree of controlled
disorder increases adhesion size driving osteogenesis.9,10 Altering cellular adhesion produces changes in cytoskeletal organization
and tension, which can affect cell behaviors.11 For example, platelet cytoskeletons have been shown to adapt to
nanopitted surfaces with the shape of the features reflected in the
actin microfilaments,2 and fibroblast actin
filaments have been seen to rearrange similarly on nanoscale circles
producing circular features in the cytoskeleton that were sensitive
to integrin inhibition.12 This has been
termed “nanoimprinting”.2

A growing number of reports indicate that surface nanoarchitecture
influences mechanotransduction, either through direct or indirect
routes.11,13,14 Direct mechanotransduction
describes the cell as a mechanical unit where conformational changes
in the cell cytoskeleton alter the shape of the nucleus and consequently
chromosomal arrangement and gene expression. On the other hand, indirect
mechanotransduction describes biochemical signaling events.13 In response to surface features, for example,
direct mechanotransduction can be driven by adhesion rearrangements
changing cytoskeletal tension and arrangement and subsequently altering
nucleus shape through linkers of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC)
complexes.11 As adhesions have signaling
molecules, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), embedded within them,
the same alterations lead to changes in G-protein and mitogen activated
protein kinase activity that can have effects on spreading, growth
and differentiation.11,15 However, the contribution of
the protein interface is not well understood in cell-nanotopographical
interactions.

It is recognized that cells do not directly interact
with the material
surface on which they are growing, but that their interaction depends
on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins for anchorage. The composition
of this adsorbed protein layer is a key mediator of cell behavior.16−18 Nanotopographical features, being in the same size range as protein
molecules, might have an effect on the amount, distribution and conformation
of the adsorbed proteins that needs to be considered.19,20 Initial studies have demonstrated, for example, that nanoscale topography
influences protein distribution between peaks and valleys, and this
in turn controls cell adhesion altering the size of FA plaques, with
larger FAs found on surfaces with an even distribution of the ECM
protein fibronectin (FN).8,21 Selective protein nanoconfinement
on different sized well-defined nanostructured surfaces has also been
shown to correlate with cell behavior.22

To enhance our understanding of the interface between cells
and
nanotopography, we set to study the effect of a particular nanotopography
implicated in cell differentiation on the adsorption of a main ECM
component and subsequently on cell behavior. We used a surface consisting
of disordered nanopits with 150 nm diameter arranged in a square pattern
(300 nm center–center spacing) but with up to ±50 nm offset
from the center position. This surface, near-square 50 (NSQ50), has
been previously shown to drive the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
stem cells.5 In this study, we use fibronectin,
an abundant component of interstitial ECM and adhesive protein present
in the serum usually used for cell cultures (including biomaterial/nanotopography
research),5 and C2C12 myoblast cells to
study the mechanisms through which cells sense nanotopographies (Figure 1). In particular,
we want to know whether FN is adsorbed inside the nanopits and if
the cells are able to exploit the FN molecules within them. FN adsorption
onto the nanostructured surface was characterized in terms of amount
and distribution inside and around the nanopits. The effect of this
interface on C2C12 cell adhesion and myogenic differentiation was
then explored with particular focus on the cell cytoskeleton.

Figure 1 Proposed mechanisms
for cell sensing of nanoscale features on a
nanostructured surface. (A) Proteins (fibronectin) are adsorbed on
the entire substrate surface, including the 100 nm-deep nanopits,
and cells are able to interact with the adsorbed protein through integrins,23,24 or (B) the nanopits are areas where the cells are not able to interact
with the protein adsorbed at the bottom of the pits.

Results
Fibronectin Adsorption
on NSQ50 Nanostructured Surfaces
Figure 2A shows the
static contact angle measured on the nanostructured polycarbonate
(PC) NSQ50 surface and on flat control before and after coating with
FN for 1 h with solutions of concentrations 2, 5, and 20 μg/mL.
Overall, both surfaces were similar in terms of wettability: bare
surfaces were hydrophobic (94.0 ± 2.1° for the flat surface
and 99.5 ± 4.1° for the NSQ50) and became more hydrophilic
once coated with FN (∼70° for both surfaces), regardless
of the concentration of FN (Figure 2A). Similar behavior was observed for dynamic measurements
of wettability: the receding contact angles decreased to zero on both
surfaces after FN coating, leading to high values of contact angle
hysteresis, above 80° on NSQ50 for concentrations greater than
5 μg/mL (Supplementary Figure S1).
It is worth noting that the advancing angle was higher on uncoated
nanostructured surfaces compared to flat controls, and the receding
angle was lower, which is compatible with the enhancement of the wetting
property of the surface as a function of its increase in surface area.

of surface density of adsorbed FN from the same FN solutions on a
flat surface (area 0.33 cm2) (a), and on the NSQ50 nanostructured

area of the nanotopography (0.33 cm2) (b), the upper surface
excluding the pits (0.27 cm2) (c), or the entire theoretical
surface area (0.51 cm2) (d). Each figure represents an
average of 3 samples per experiment and measurements were repeated
3 times. Values in graphs represent mean ± standard deviation;
statistically significant differences are indicated with ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.

The surface density of adsorbed
FN on the NSQ50 nanopits and flat
surface was calculated by measuring the depletion of protein from
solution. For FN solutions of 2, 5, and 20 μg/mL respectively,
the density of FN adsorbed on NSQ50 and flat control surfaces similarly
increased with solution concentration, from ∼100 to ∼400
and ∼1800 ng/cm2 on the flat surface, and from ∼50
to ∼150 ng/cm2 and ∼2000 ng/cm2 on the nanostructured materials (Figure 2B a, b). The density values were calculated
considering three potential hypotheses. First, only the projected
area of the surfaces adsorbs FN and if this were the case, no statistically
significant differences would be detected between flat and nanostructured
surfaces (Figure 2B
b). Second, if it were the case that no protein could enter the nanopits,
the density of adsorbed FN would be statistically higher on the NSQ50
surface compared to the flat control for a concentration of 20 μg/mL
(Figure 2B c). Third,
and conversely, if we considered the whole surface area as area available
for FN adsorption, the density would be lower on the nanostructured
surface (Figure 2B
d).

To investigate these hypotheses further, nanostructured
PC surfaces
(bare and FN coated) were characterized by means of tapping mode atomic
force microscopy (AFM). Figure 3 shows height images of the uncoated and coated flat surface
(first and second row) and of the NSQ50 nanotopography, uncoated or
coated with 2, 5, and 20 μg/mL FN solutions. The increase in
surface area of the nanostructured surfaces compared to flat control
measured via AFM (∼53%) was found to be in
agreement with the theoretical value used to calculate the surface
area (0.51 cm2) in Figure 2B d. Pits were shown to be ∼90 nm deep. The
bare flat surface and the nanotopography, both the bottom of the pits
and the top surface in between pits were very smooth, with a similar
root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ∼1.5 nm (Table 1). AFM images of other (ordered
and disordered) bare nanotopographies are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. On the flat surface, FN is adsorbed
in aggregates and a continuous monolayer is formed upon FN adsorption
from a 20 μg/mL solution (Figure 3, second row, and Supplementary Figure S3). On the nanostructured surfaces, after FN adsorption
from a 2 μg/mL solution, protein was observed in globular aggregates
both on the surface and inside the pits: transversal sections of the
AFM height images showed the protein at the bottom of the nanopits
(Figure 3, fourth row).
Similar observations were made after adsorption from FN solutions
of concentrations 5 and 20 μg/mL; FN formed globular clusters
on the surface and inside the nanopits.

More FN aggregates were spotted on the top surface
of the nanotopographies
increasing with direct proportionality to the concentration of the
coating solution used and in accordance with data on FN density (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
this was not the case for the inside of the nanopits, where fewer
aggregates were seen at the higher FN concentrations (20 μg/mL).
This was possibly due to high protein coverage of the bottom and walls
of the pits from the adsorbed protein, as suggested by the decrease
in pit depth (from ∼90 to ∼80 nm) and diameter (from
∼150 to ∼100 nm). Similar observations were made with
other arrangements of nanostructured pits as shown in Supplementary Figure S4, showing protein adsorbed
both in the interpits areas and inside the nanopits. Measurement of
surface roughness confirmed the previous observations, as the roughness
of the top surface of the nanotopography increased with FN solution
concentration (Table 1). The increase of the roughness of the bottom of the pits was less
pronounced and it was even diminished for the 20 μg/mL FN concentration,
which is compatible with the formation of a layer of protein (Figure 3, sixth row). The
same distribution of the protein, both inside the nanopits and outside
of them, in the form of globular clusters, could be observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 7A). The effect of the nanotopography
on protein distribution was also confirmed by fluorescence microscopy
of adsorbed FITC-labeled FN (Supplementary Figure S5); the technique lacked resolution to distinguish between
bottom of the nanopits and spaces between them but, in accordance
with the AFM results, a continuous protein layer was observed on the
flat surface, whereas clusters organized by the nanofeatures were
seen on NSQ50 polycarbonate. All the data illustrate that the whole
surface area is available to FN adsorption and is thus indicative
of a reduced FN density across the surface supporting the hypothesis
proposed in Figure 2B d.

Cell Adhesion on NSQ50
Cell behavior on the NSQ50 nanotopography
coated with FN was studied to assess the effect of FN-coated nanotopographies
on C2C12 myoblasts. Early adhesion experiments (3 h) were carried
out in serum-free conditions with/without blebbistatin (inhibitor
of myosin II) after coating the surfaces with a 20 μg/mL FN
solution. C2C12s were seeded at a low density (5000 cells/cm2) on the samples to maximize cell–material interactions and
to minimize cell–cell interactions.

Cells had a similar
size on both flat and nanostructured surfaces in the presence or absence
of blebbistatin (Figure 4A). To study the formation of FAs and quantify their maturation level
on the NSQ50 nanostructured surface, frequency distributions of the
FA size (defined as the length of the major axis of the FA plaque)
were obtained through image analysis of the vinculin stained images
(process detailed in Supplementary Figure S6,25,26 representative images of FAs in Figure 4F, G). FA complexes
(dot-like complexes shorter than 1 μm in size)27 were discarded from the analysis. Fewer FAs were observed
on the nanostructured surface compared to the flat control (Figure 4B). Moreover, the
addition of blebbistatin significantly reduced the number of FAs on
both surfaces. Size distribution was similar on nanostructured and
flat polycarbonate, with a monotonic decrease from a higher fraction
of smaller plaques (Figures 4D and E) and no significant difference in the average FA size
(Figure 4C). On NSQ50
surfaces, a slightly higher percentage of long FAs (≥3 μm)
was observed (∼11% on NSQ50 vs ∼7%
on control, Figure 4D and E); note that a shift from many smaller adhesion to fewer but
larger adhesion has also been seen in osteoblasts28 and MSCs on this surface.5 Blebbistatin
inhibited the formation of long FAs more significantly on the nanostructured
surface compared to the flat control demonstrating tension dependence
of the adhesions.

Cell Differentiation on NSQ50
Myogenic differentiation
of C2C12 cells grown on the NSQ50 nanopit topography was studied and
compared to the flat control. The degree of differentiation was measured
as the percentage of sarcomeric myosin-positive cells (Figure 5). Results showed significantly
higher differentiation for cells on NSQ50 (∼50%) compared to
the flat control (∼25%). Similarly, a higher number of cells
were observed on the nanostructured surface. We note that cells did
not proliferate on non-FN coated surfaces and that when a range of
FN coated patterns were used no differences in cell growth were noted
(Supplementary Figure S7).

Nanoimprinting of C2C12 Cells on NSQ50 Nanotopographies
To characterize the cell–FN–nanopit interaction, cell
culture studies were performed in serum-free conditions and cells
were observed via AFM. C2C12 cells were found to
attach and spread on both FN coated flat and nanostructured surfaces
(Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure S8A). Without any protein
coating on the surface, cell spreading was impaired (Figure 6B). Furthermore, cells were
able to spread on the protein coated surfaces in the presence of agents
that interfere with cytoskeletal arrangement, namely blebbistatin
(inhibitor of myosin II) or paclitaxel (microtubules stabilizer) (Figures 6C, D and Supplementary Figures S8B, C). AFM revealed differences
in cell morphology across these various conditions. Cells grown in
basal medium after FN coating of the surface spread and interacted
with the nanopits; on the other hand, on uncoated nanostructures cells
appeared to be more rounded and were not affected by the nanofeatures
(Figure 6A, B). Cells
treated with blebbistatin had a highly arborated morphology with thin
membrane protrusions similar to retraction fibers. Finally, cells
grown in the presence of paclitaxel were very well spread, with a
bloated appearance and only small membrane protrusions (Figure 6C, D and Supplementary Figures S8B, C).

substrates (B), in medium containing blebbistatin (C), or paclitaxel

(25 × 25 μm2) show the height magnitude and
the 3D reconstruction of the cell. The second row (b) shows image
insets (5 × 5 μm2); the lower row (c) shows
a transversal section of the cell-nanotopography interphase, corresponding
to the white line in (b).

On the NSQ50 nanotopography, cells were seen to nanoimprint
(Figure 6A a) and were
noted
to even protrude into the nanopits as highlighted by observing transversal
sections at the cell edges (Figure 6A b, c). On the other hand, in the absence of a protein
coating cells appeared to reduce, almost completely, any nanotopographical
interactions (Figure 6B b, c). Moreover, during culture on FN coated nanotopographies,
transversal sections demonstrated reduced ability of the cells to
emboss the imprint of the substrate with blebbistatin or paclitaxel
addition (Figure 6C
and D); the extent of nanoimprinting was limited to the edges of the
membrane protrusions. Scanning electron micrographs of cells grown
on the nanostructured surfaces in the presence of a FN coating confirmed
cell protrusions entering the nanopits (Figure 7B), further indicating
the ability of cells to interact with FN molecules adsorbed at the
bottom of the nanopits (Figure 7A). Through trialing adsorption of vitronectin, a multifunctional
protein of the ECM that is, moreover, the other main cell adhesive
component of serum, and culture with complete serum, cell nanoimprinting
was found to be independent of the protein coating with cell filopodia
entering the nanopits in all conditions (Supplementary Figure S9).

Discussion
Various studies have
demonstrated the influence of nanotopographies
on protein adsorption8,21,22 and cell behavior1−9,29−31 including stem
cell differentiation5 and growth.4 These effects have been postulated to be transduced
through indirect (biochemical) and direct (biomechanical) processes
related to adhesion and cytoskeletal conformation.13 In this study, we aim to help elucidate the role of the
protein interface and its involvement in the start point of the mechanotransductive
cascade–adhesion formation and cytoskeletal reorganization
(Figure 1).

Using
a simple cell model, C2C12 myoblasts, a difference in focal
adhesion assembly and myogenic differentiation was observed comparing
the NSQ50 nanotopography (which has been shown to trigger MSC osteogenic
differentiation)5 to flat controls in order
to help show further potential of this surface. Previous studies have
shown the role of FN in regulating C2C12 behavior in vitro.32,33 FN promotes C2C12 alignment and fusion,
and, in combination with nano- and microline patterns, enhances myogenic
differentiation.32,33 Our results with the NSQ50 surface
show no evident effect on C2C12 morphology or size. However, while
the number of FAs diminished in cells on the nanotopography, the adhesions
tended to become longer (Figure 4). This ties in well with formation of super mature
adhesion on this surface in MSCs undergoing osteogenesis28 and with other reports showing that nanotopography
can affect cell adhesion.5,8,9,34−37 The C2C12s were then noted to
undergo more extensive myogenic differentiation (Figure 5). Importantly, the influence
of the nanotopography was reversed by the addition of a contractility
inhibitor, blebbistatin, in the culture medium (Figure 4). This indicates that the sensing of the
nanoarchitecture is related to cell contractility.11 It is important to note that blebbistatin ablated the ability
of cells to form large FAs more effectively on the nanotopography
than on the flat controls demonstrating the importance of adhesion
and cytoskeletal tension in cell response to the patterns.

In
order to correlate these results to the adsorbed protein layer
which mediates cell-material interaction, the material interface was
characterized through wettability measurements, quantification of
adsorbed FN and atomic force microscopy. Static and dynamic water
contact angle measurements of the bare nanotopography revealed wetting
of the entire surface area (Figures 2A and S1). Upon FN adsorption,
both surfaces became more hydrophilic regardless of the amount of
adsorbed protein. Unexpectedly, the potential increase in surface
area granted by the nanotopography was not reflected in an increase
of the amount of adsorbed protein. Both AFM and SEM analyses revealed
that FN was adsorbed in globular clusters not only on the interpits
spaces, but also inside the nanopits (Figure 3 and 7A), with higher
coverage at increasing protein solution concentrations. This phenomenon
was not limited to the NSQ50 nanotopography but occurred also on substrates
with other arrangements of the nanostructured pits (Figure S4). The diameter of the pit (150 nm) appeared to be
large enough to avoid nanoconfinement effects22 and to allow FN to be adsorbed both at the bottom and on the walls
of the nanopits (Figure 3). This means that the entire surface area of the nanotopography
was available for FN adsorption, as suggested by the wettability data.
As a result, when FN was adsorbed from a 20 μg/mL solution,
surface density values on the nanoarchitecture were reduced compared
to the flat control. This is in agreement with the hypothesis proposed
in Figure 2B d. As
on the nanopits the FN conformation tended to be globular and confluent
adsorption was not noted (as on flat control at 20 μg/mL, Figures S3 and S5), we can postulate that the
nanotopographical features, being in the same size range as protein
molecules, potentially disrupt FN adsorption. This disruption may
act to reduce the continuous protein coverage observed on flat controls,
resulting in a less efficient FN adsorption per unit of surface area.

Nanoimprinting2,34 was observed in the C2C12 cells
grown on the nanotopography coated with 20 μg/mL of FN (Figure 6A). Many types of
cells use filopodia to probe their nanoenvironment and filopodia have
been seen to interact with nanoscale topographies.1,35 Here,
however, is the evidence that cells can probe inside such small features.
The C2C12s exhibited filopodia that made contact with the edges of
pits and also entered the nanopits (Figure 7B). The reorganization of adhesions and alterations
in cell “sensing” led to embossing of the nanopit morphologies
into the membranes of the cells. On the other hand, no evidence of
interaction of the cells with the nanofeatures was found when the
surface was not coated with fibronectin, pointing to a critical role
of the protein interface (Figure 6B).

Inhibition with blebbistatin caused disruption
of nanoimprinting
suggesting that adhesion-based cytoskeleton tension drove the effect
as cells interacted with the protein coated features (Figure 6C). Stabilizing the cytoskeleton
with paclitaxel also inhibited the nanoimprinting effect suggesting
that the cytoskeleton needs to be dynamic to adapt to the feature
morphologies (Figure 6D). Furthermore, nanoimprinting was independent of the protein coating
and occurred in the presence of other ECM proteins besides FN (Figure S9). Critically we show that while the
effect is dependent upon nanoscale topography, it is mediated by the
protein layer and without this layer, the effect is not observed.
This demonstrates that the biointerface is a critical component of
the nanotopography-induced mechanotransduction.

Conclusion
In
this work we show that many of the topography-driven changes
in adhesion and cytoskeleton organization responsible for processes
such as the control of cell differentiation are mediated by the protein
interface. Furthermore, we show that FN can coat the insides of nanoscale
pits and facilitate cell exploration of the pits.

Methods
Polycarbonate Substrates
Nanotopographic
pits patterns
were manufactured in polycarbonate (PC) using a 3-step process: electron
beam lithography,38 nickel die fabrication
and injection molding. In short, the master substrates were fabricated
to form an array of 150 nm diameter pits of 100 nm depth and 300 nm
average pitch in a disordered square array with dots displaced randomly
by up to 50 nm on both axes from their position in a square lattice
(NSQ50). A flat PC surface was used as control.

Protein Adsorption
The model surfaces (NSQ50 and flat)
were cleaned with distilled water, dried and coated with human plasma
FN (Sigma) solutions at 2, 5, and 20 μg/mL in Dulbecco’s
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) for 1 h.

Water Contact Angle
Water contact angle (WCA) analysis
was carried out on bare PC substrate and on FN-coated surfaces. Measurements
were carried out using the sessile drop method with a Theta optical
tensiometer (Biolin Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden). For each condition,
the static contact angle (SCA) of the drop was determined by placing
a drop of 3 μL of Milli-Q water on the surface and measuring
the angle of the drop with the substrate surface. Also, advancing
contact angle (ACA) and receding contact angle (RCA) were determined
by changing the volume of the droplet (respectively adding or removing
water from the previously deposited drop) and measuring the contact
angle when the three phase boundary between water, air and substrate
moved. All these measurements were performed at room temperature and
average values were obtained from 3 measurements of at least three
different samples.

Quantification of Adsorbed FN
The
biochemical assay
based on the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA protein assay, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used following manufacturer instructions
to determine the total amount of protein adsorbed on the PC nanotopography
substrate surfaces. The latter were coated with FN for 1 h at different
solution concentrations and the density of adsorbed protein was determined
by measuring the amount of nonadsorbed FN. After coating for 1 h,
the FN solution was collected and transferred to a 96-well plate followed
by the addition of the bicinchoninic acid working reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). FN solutions at 20, 5, and 2 μg/mL
were used as standards. The plate was then placed in an incubator
for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was read on a Tecan NanoQuant
Infinite M200 Pro plate reader (Männedorf, Switzerland) at
562 nm and the total protein adsorbed on the substrates was calculated
subtracting the amount of protein remaining in the supernatant from
the total amount of protein in the initial solution.

Cell Culture
Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture
Collection, Blau et al. 1985) were maintained in
growth media (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media with
4.5 g/L glucose and l-glutamine, Gibco) supplemented with
20% v/v heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), and 1% v/v
penicillin/streptomycin solution (P/S, Gibco) after thawing and passaged
using standard techniques. The cells were passaged by trypsination
(0.5% trypsin in 0.5 mM EDTA, Gibco) from the culture flask at 70%
confluence.

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM experiments
were performed
with a Nanowizard 3 (JPK, Berlin, Germany). The images were acquired
in tapping mode in air using silicon cantilevers (FMV from Bruker
AFM Probes, Billerica, MA) with a pyramidal tip, a force constant
of 3 N/m, a resonance frequency of ∼75 kHz, and a radius of
curvature of 10 nm. A schematic of the cantilever tip and of its size
in relation to the nanotopographical features of the surface is shown
in Supplementary Figure S10. Height, phase
and amplitude magnitudes were recorded simultaneously for each image.
Images were analyzed using JPK processing software and Gwyddion (64
bit) to calculate the average depth of the pits of the nanotopographies,
their surface area and roughness.

To do AFM experiments on cells,
cells were seeded on the samples at 5000 cells/cm2 in media
with or without 10 μM blebbistatin (BB) or 10 μM paclitaxel
and were fixed with formaldehyde 3.7% for 20 min at 4 °C after
incubation for 3 h without FBS. The samples were washed with DPBS,
then water, finally dried with an air flow.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
C2C12 murine myoblast
cells were seeded on the samples at 5000 cells/cm2 and
were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for
1 h at 4 °C. Then, cells were washed 3 times in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate buffer before a 1-h incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.1
M sodium cacodylate buffer. Samples were then washed 3 times with
distilled water and stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate/distilled water
for 1 h in the dark. Samples were washed again with distilled water
before dehydration through an ethanol gradient (30, 50, 70, 90 and
100% ethanol). Finally, samples were loaded onto a POLARON E3000 Critical
Point Dryer (Liquid CO2) for 1 h 20 min and then given
a gold/palladium coating using a POLARON SC515 SEM COATER and viewed
on a JEOL6400 SEM running at 10 kilovolts.

Cell Adhesion
C2C12 cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/cm2 density in
media ±10 μM BB on the nanotopography
substrates (sterilized under UV for 20 min in 4 wells plates) previously
coated for 1 h with FN 20 μg/mL. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde
3.7% for 20 min at 4 °C after incubation for 3 h without FBS.
The samples were permeabilized for 5 min using a Triton X-100 based
permeabilization buffer (0.5% v/v Triton X-100, 10.3% w/v saccharose,
0.292% w/v NaCl, 0.06% w/v MgCl2, and 0.476% w/v HEPES adjusted to
pH 7.2), and blocked with DPBS/BSA 1% w/v for 30 min. Then samples
were stained for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with a primary antibody
against mouse vinculin hVIN-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which
stains the FAs. Afterward, the samples were washed 3 times with DPBS/tween20
0.5% w/v, then incubated for a further 1 h in the dark at RT with
a secondary antibody (Cy3 antimouse), coupled with BODIPY FL phallacidin
(Invitrogen) which stains the actin filaments. Finally, the samples
were washed 3 times and then mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) before visualizing using an
epifluorescence microscope. Images were taken and channels merged
using ImageJ (1.47v) to localize nuclei, actin, and FAs. The latter
were quantified using the FA analysis server.25 ImageJ (1.47v) was also used to analyze immunostained pictures.

Myogenic Differentiation Experiment
C2C12 cells were
harvested and seeded at 20 000 cells/cm2 in DMEM
supplemented with 1% P/S and 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium-X (Life
Technologies) on the NSQ50 and flat surfaces previously coated with
FN 20 μg/mL for 1 h. Medium was changed after 3 h and again
after 2 days. The cells were kept for 4 days at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere under 5% CO2 before fixing with a 20:2:1 mixture
of 70% ethanol, 37% formaldehyde and acetic acid. Samples were blocked
for 1 h at RT with 5% goat serum in DPBS and stained for sarcomeric
myosin by incubating with primary antibody (MF-20, Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank) 1:250 at 37 °C for 1 h; afterward the samples
were once more blocked for 10 min at RT, and then the secondary antibody
(rabbit antimouse Cy3, Jackson Immunoresearch) 1:200 was added at
37 °C for 1 h. Samples were finally mounted on microscopy slides
with mounting medium containing DAPI to stain the nuclei (VectaShield
with DAPI, Vector Laboratories). All the samples were in triplicates.
Images were acquired with an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope.

Statistical Analysis
For the comparison of the different
groups, one-way ANOVA was used with a Bonferroni post hoc test to
compare all columns (GraphPad Prism 5.03) and the differences between
groups were considered significant for p < 0.05.
All error bars are standard deviation.
