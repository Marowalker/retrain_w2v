We present flexible photodetectors
(PDs) for visible wavelengths
fabricated by stacking centimeter-scale chemical vapor deposited (CVD)
single layer graphene (SLG) and single layer CVD MoS2,
both wet transferred onto a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate.
The operation mechanism relies on injection of photoexcited electrons
from MoS2 to the SLG channel. The external responsivity
is 45.5A/W and the internal 570A/W at 642 nm. This is at least 2 orders
of magnitude higher than bulk-semiconductor flexible membranes. The
photoconductive gain is up to 4 × 105. The photocurrent
is in the 0.1–100 μA range. The devices are semitransparent,
with 8% absorptance at 642 nm, and are stable upon bending to a curvature
of 1.4 cm. These capabilities and the low-voltage operation (<1
V) make them attractive for wearable applications.

Modern electronic
and optoelectronic
systems, such as smart phones, smart glasses, smart watches, wearable
devices, and electronic tattoos, increasingly require ultrathin, transparent,
low-cost, and energy efficient devices on flexible substrates.1 The rising demand for flexible electronics and
optoelectronics requires materials that can provide a variety of electrical
and optical functionalities, with constant performance upon application
of strain.2 A wide range of optoelectronic
devices on flexible substrates have been reported to date, such as
photodetectors (PDs),3,4 light emitting diodes (LEDs),5 optical filters,6 optical
interconnects,7,8 photovoltaic devices,9,10 and biomedical sensors.11,12

Major challenges
in the development of flexible optoelectronic
devices stem from the limitations associated with the high stiffness
of bulk semiconductors.13,14 In the case of flexible
PDs, the current approaches primarily rely on thin (μm-thick)
semiconductor membranes4,15 and compound semiconductor nanowires
(NWs),3,16−18 mainly because of their
ability to absorb light throughout the whole visible range (0.4–0.7
μm) and the possibility to adapt their fabrication techniques
from rigid to plastic, or deformable substrates.1

One of the key parameters for PDs characterization
is the responsivity.
This is defined as the ratio between the collected photocurrent (Iph) and the optical power. The responsivity
is named external (Rext = Iph/Po)19 or internal (Rint = Iph/Pabs),19 whenever the incident (Po) or absorbed (Pabs) optical power
is used in the denominator. Since not all incident photons are absorbed
by a PD, i.e., Pabs < Po, then Rint is typically larger than Rext.19

In flexible PDs, Rext up to∼
0.3 A/W was reported for crystalline semiconductor membranes (InP,
Ge)4,15 with integrated p–i–n junctions,
showing photocurrent up to∼ 100 μA, with∼ 30%
degradation upon bending at a radius rb ∼ 3 cm.15 PDs made of a single
semiconductor NW on flexible substrates3,16−18 demonstrated Rext up to∼ 105 A/W, for rb down to 0.3 cm.3 Yet, these provide limited Iph in the order of nA3,16,18 up to <1 μA.17 For flexible devices exploiting NW arrays by drop-casting,3,16,18 rather than based on single NWs, Rext degrades significantly from ∼105 A/W to the mA/W range,3,16,18 due to photocurrent loss at multiple junctions in the NW network.3,16,18

Graphene and related materials
(GRMs) have great potential in photonics
and optoelectronics.20−23 A variety of GRM-based devices have been reported, such as flexible
displays,24 photovoltaic modules,25,26 photodetectors,22,27−29 optical modulators,30 plasmonic devices,31−35 and ultrafast lasers.23 Heterostructures, obtained by stacking layers of different materials,
were also explored,21,22e.g., in photovoltaic36 and light emitting
devices.37

Flexible PDs based on
GRMs were studied for ultraviolet,38,39 visible,40−45 and near-infrared bands.46,47 In these devices, different
materials and heterostructures produced by mechanical exfoliation,40,41 Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD),42,43,46 and liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE)44,45,47 were employed. The flexible PDs produced
by mechanical exfoliation40,41 have a small (∼μm2) photoactive area, and they cannot be scaled up to mass production.
LPE-based PDs have low (<mA/W)44,45 responsivity.
Ref (47) showed that
thick (∼μm) films of chemically modified, charge-transfer
optimized, LPE-produced, MoSe2 and MoS2 polymer
composites can provide ∼ A/W responsivity47 at near-infrared bands. Nevertheless, these PDs require
high (∼10 V) operation voltage and are nontransparent. Flexible
PDs at 450 nm using CVD MoS2 transistors42 and MoS2/WS2 heterostructures43 were previously reported, and PDs at 780 nm
were prepared from doped SLG p–n junctions.38 However, these devices have responsivity in the mA/W range.
CVD-based SLG/MoS2 heterostructures48 showed good photodetection on rigid Si/SiO2 substrates,
with back-gate-dependent Rint ∼
108A/W for optical intensities <0.1pW/μm2.

Here we demonstrate a polymer electrolyte (PE) gated, CVD-based,
flexible PD, for visible wavelengths, with large (∼mm2) photoactive area combined with high responsivity (∼hundreds
A/W), high (>80%) transparency, gate tunability, low (<1 V)
operation
voltage, and stable (±12%) Iph upon
multiple (>30) bending cycles. The device is assembled by stacking
on a PET substrate a centimeter-scale CVD single layer graphene (SLG)
on top of a CVD-grown single layer MoS2 (1L-MoS2). In this configuration, 1L-MoS2 acts as visible light
absorber, while SLG is the conductive channel for photocurrent flow.48 We show that Rext can be increased by promoting carrier injection from 1L-MoS2 to SLG using PE gating, or by increasing the source-drain
voltage. This is achieved in devices with∼ 82% transparency,
twice that reported for semiconductor membrane devices.15 We get Rint ∼
570A/W for ∼0.1nW/μm2 at 642 nm, similar to
SLG/MoS2 PDs48 on rigid substrates
operating at the same optical power. This shows that SLG/MoS2 heterostructures on PET retain their photodetection capabilities.
We note that the devices from ref (48) have at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller
photoactive area with respect to ours, and they are not flexible,
not transparent, and require tens of volts operation, unlike the <1
V of ours. Upon bending, our PDs have stable performance for rb down to ∼1.4 cm. This is comparable
to rb measured in semiconductor membranes
PDs,4,15 which show lower (<0.3 A/W) responsivities.4,15 Although our rb is 1 order of magnitude
larger than for flexible single NWs,3,16−18 the latter had at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller device areas
(<5 μm2)3,16−18 compared to our PDs (>0.2 mm2). Given the responsivity,
flexibility, transparency, and low operation voltage, our PDs may
be integrated in wearable, biomedical, and low-power optoelectronic
applications.11,12,17

Results
Figure 1a plots
a schematic drawing of our PDs. We fabricated 4 PD arrays with 10
devices each, with channel lengths of 100 μm, 200 μm,
500 μm, and 1 mm. Each device consists of a 1L-MoS2 absorber covered by a SLG channel, clamped between source and drain
electrodes. We chose PET as a flexible substrate due to its ∼90%
transparency in the visible range49 and
ability to withstand solvents (e.g., acetone and isopropyl alcohol)50 commonly
used in the transfer processes of layered materials grown by CVD (e.g., transfer of SLG grown on Cu).51 A 1L-MoS2 is used as absorber in
order to preserve >80% transparency, considered suitable by industry
for wearable applications,52Figure 1b. The SLG/1L-MoS2 heterostructure is gated using a PE.53,54

The operation principle of our devices is depicted
in Figure 2. For energy
bands
alignment, the electron affinity of 1L-MoS2 and the Dirac
point of SLG are assumed to be ∼4–4.2 eV55,56 and ∼4.6 eV,57,58 respectively. We also assume
SLG to be initially p-doped (Figure 2a), as reported in previous works involving SLG transferred
on PET.59,60 At zero voltage the device is in thermodynamic
equilibrium with a constant Fermi level (EF) and zero current flow between the layers. During illumination and
photon absorption in MoS2, part of the photogenerated electrons
would be injected from the 1L-MoS2 conduction band into
the lower energy states in p-doped SLG,48 leaving behind the uncompensated charge of photogenerated holes.
The latter would be trapped in 1L-MoS2 and act as an additional
positive gate voltage, VGS, applied to
the SLG channel, resulting in a shift of the charge neutrality point
(VCNP) to more negative voltages. The
injected electrons from 1L-MoS2 would occupy energy states
above EF (Figure 2b), thus reducing the hole concentration
and decreasing the hole current in the SLG channel. Electron injection
can be further promoted by gating. When a negative VGS is applied, higher p-doping of the SLG channel would
induce a stronger electric field at the SLG/1L-MoS2 interface,48 thus favoring electron transfer from 1L-MoS2 (Figure 2b).
Hence, for negative VGS, Rext is expected to increase, due to injection of more
photoelectrons to SLG and consequent more pronounced current reduction.
The opposite should happen for positive VGS, where the gate-induced negative charge in SLG would reduce the
p-doping and shift EF toward the Dirac
point. In this case, the photogenerated electrons in 1L-MoS2 would experience weaker electric fields at the SLG/1L-MoS2 interface48 and would become less attracted
by the SLG channel. Thus, we expect Rext to decrease. For high enough positive VGS, EF would cross the Dirac point, and
SLG becomes n-doped (Figure 2c). As a result, only a weak electron injection from 1L-MoS2 would be possible, if EF in SLG
remains below the 1L-MoS2 conduction band, retaining a
weak electric field at the interface. In this regime, the transferred
electrons would increase the free carrier concentration in the n-doped
channel, hence only minor increments of Rext and Iph are expected.

(a) zero, (b) negative, and (c) positive VGS.

Our devices are built as follows:
1L-MoS2 is epitaxially
grown by CVD on c-plane sapphire substrates,61 while SLG is grown on a 35 μm Cu foil, following the process
described in refs (51 and 62) (see Methods for details). Prior to assembling the SLG/MoS2 stack, the quality and uniformity of MoS2 on sapphire
and SLG on Cu are inspected by Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence
(PL), using a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800 spectrometer equipped with a
100× objective. The laser power is kept below 100 μW (spot
size <1 μm) to avoid possible heating effects or damage. Figure 3a (green curve) plots the Raman spectrum of CVD MoS2 on
sapphire for 514 nm excitation. The peak at ∼385 cm–1 corresponds to the in-plane (E2g1) mode,63,64 while that at ∼404
cm–1 is the out of plane (A1g) mode,63,64 with full width at half-maximum FWHM (E2g1) = 2.5 and FWHM(A1g) = 3.6
cm–1, respectively. The E2g1 mode softens, whereas the A1g stiffens with increasing layer thickness,65,66 so that their frequency difference can be used to monitor the number
of layers.65 The peak position difference
∼20 cm–1 is an indicator of 1L-MoS2.65 The peak at∼ 417 cm–1 (marked by an asterisk in Figure 3a) corresponds to the A1g mode of sapphire.67

sapphire,

at 514 nm of the Raman spectra of as-grown SLG on Cu (magenta curve)
and SLG/1L-MoS2 after transfer on PET and normalized subtraction
of the PET substrate signal (blue curve). (c) Raman spectra at 514
nm of PET substrate (black curve), 1L-MoS2 on PET (red
curve) and SLG/1L-MoS2 on PET (blue curve).

The Raman spectrum measured at 514 nm of SLG on
Cu is shown in Figure 3b (magenta curve).
This is obtained after the removal of the background PL of Cu.68 The two most intense features are the G and
the 2D peak, with no significant D peak. The G peak corresponds to
the E2g phonon at the Brillouin zone center.69 The D peak is due to the breathing modes of
sp2 rings and requires a defect for its activation by double
resonance.69−72 The 2D peak is the second order of the D peak.69 This is always seen, even when no D peak is present, since
no defects are required for the activation of two phonons with the
same momentum, one backscattering from the other.69 In our sample, the 2D peak is a single sharp Lorentzian
with FWHM(2D) ∼26 cm–1, a signature of SLG.70 Different (∼20) measurements show similar
spectra, indicating uniform quality throughout the sample. The position
of the G peak, Pos(G), is ∼1588 cm–1, with
FWHM(G) ∼6 cm–1. The 2D peak position, Pos(2D)
is ∼2705 cm–1, while the 2D to G peak intensity
and area ratios, I(2D)/I(G) and A(2D)/A(G), are ∼2.6 and ∼5.8,
respectively, indicating a p-doping ∼300 meV,53,73,74 which corresponds to a carrier
concentration ∼6 × 1012cm–2.

Another evidence for 1L-MoS2 comes from the PL
spectrum
[Figure 4a (green curve)],
showing a peak at ∼658 nm (∼1.88 eV), due to band-to-band
radiative recombination in 1L-MoS2.75

Figure 4 (a) PL spectrum at 514 nm (2.41 eV) of 1L-MoS2 on sapphire
and 1L-MoS2 after transfer on PET. (b) PL spectra of PET
substrate (black curve), 1L-MoS2 on PET (red curve), and
SLG/1L-MoS2 on PET (blue curve).

Then, the MoS2 film is transferred onto a PET
substrate
from sapphire using a KOH-based approach.61 The samples are first spin coated with ∼100 nm poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA). This is detached in a 30% KOH solution, washed
in deionized (DI) water, and transferred onto PET. The PMMA is then
dissolved in acetone. Subsequently, SLG is transferred on the 1L-MoS2 on PET. PMMA is spin coated on the SLG/Cu substrate and then
placed in a solution of ammonium persulfate (APS) in DI water until
Cu is etched.51,76 The PMMA membrane with attached
SLG is then transferred to a beaker filled with DI water for cleaning
APS residuals. The membrane is subsequently lifted with the target
PET substrate, having 1L-MoS2 on top. After drying, PMMA
is removed in acetone leaving SLG on 1L-MoS2.

Raman
and PL characterizations are performed at each step of the
SLG/1L-MoS2 assembly on PET, i.e., on 1L-MoS2 transferred on PET and on SLG
on 1L-MoS2. This is to confirm no degradation during the
fabrication process. Figure 3a (red curve) plots the Raman spectrum of 1L-MoS2 on PET. The frequency difference between E2g1 and A1g and the FWHMs are
preserved on PET, suggesting no degradation. The PL spectrum of 1L-MoS2 on PET is shown in Figure 4b (red curve). The signal from 1L-MoS2 is
convolved within the background due to the PET substrate [Figure 4b (black curve)].
In order to reveal the underlying PL signature of 1L-MoS2, we use a point-to-point subtraction between the spectrum of 1L-MoS2 on PET [Figure 4b (red curve)] and the reference PET spectrum [Figure 4b (black curve)]. Prior to subtraction, the
spectra are normalized to the intensity of the Raman peak at ∼1615
cm–1 (corresponding to the peak at ∼560 nm
in Figure 4b), due
to the stretching vibrations of benzene rings in PET.77 As a result, the PL signal of 1L-MoS2 can be
seen in Figure 4a (blue
curve) revealing no significant changes after transfer. The subsequent
transfer of SLG on 1L-MoS2 does not alter the 1L-MoS2 PL position and line shape [Figure 4b (blue curve)].

We then characterize
the SLG transferred on 1L-MoS2/PET.
The intense Raman features of the underlying PET substrate77 [Figure 3c (black curve)] mask the SLG peaks. In order to reveal the
Raman signatures of SLG, we first measure the reference spectrum,
shown in Figure 3c
(black curve), of a PET substrate, using identical conditions as those
for SLG/1L-MoS2/PET. We then implement a point-to-point
subtraction, normalized to the intensity of the PET peak at ∼1615
cm–1, of the PET reference spectrum, Figure 3c (black curve), from the total
spectrum, Figure 3c
(blue curve). The result is in Figure 3b (blue curve). The 2D peak retains its single-Lorentzian
line-shape with FWHM(2D) ∼28 cm–1, validating
the transfer of SLG. The negligible D peak indicates that no significant
defects are induced during transfer. Pos(G) is ∼1583 cm–1, FWHM(G) ∼ 17 cm–1, Pos(2D)
∼ 2683 cm–1, and A(2D)/A(G) ∼ 4.8,
indicating a p-doping ∼4 × 1012cm–2 (∼250 meV).53,73

We then measure the absorptance
and transmittance of SLG/1L-MoS2 using a broadband (400–1300
nm) white light from a
tungsten halogen lamp. The transmitted light is collected by a 10×
objective lens (NA = 0.25) with a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800 spectrometer
equipped with a 300 grooves/mm grating, charged coupled device (CCD)
detector and a 50 μm pinhole. Figure 5a plots the optical transmittance of bare
PET (TPET, black line), 1L-MoS2 on PET (TMoS2, red line),
and the final SLG/1L-MoS2 stack on PET (THetero, blue line) measured in the 400–800 nm wavelength
range. Figure 5b plots
the absorptance of 1L-MoS2 on PET (AbsMoS2, red line) and of SLG/1L-MoS2 on PET (AbsHetero, blue line), calculated as AbsMoS2 = (TPET – TMoS2)/TPET and AbsHetero = (TPET – THetero)/TPET. The three peaks in Figure 5b at ∼650
nm (1.91 eV), ∼603 nm (2.06 eV), and ∼428 nm (2.90 eV)
correspond to the A, B, C excitons of 1L-MoS2.75,78 Their positions remain unchanged after SLG transfer. The absorptance
difference between the two curves (red and blue) is ∼2.6%,
consistent with the additional SLG absorption.79

(red curve), and SLG/1L-MoS2 on PET (blue curve). (b) Absorptance
of 1L-MoS2 and SLG/1L-MoS2 as derived from the
transmittance measurements. Dashed lines indicate our test wavelength.

The PD area is shaped by etching,
whereby SLG extending beyond
the 1L-MoS2 flake is removed in an oxygen plasma. The source,
drain and gate electrodes are then defined by patterning the contacts
area, followed by Cr/Au (6 nm/60 nm) evaporation and lift-off. PDs
with different channels lengths (100 μm to 1 mm), 2 mm channel
width, and common side-gate electrodes (1 × 0.5 cm) are built
(Figure 1b).

Ref (48) showed
that the responsivity of SLG/MoS2 PDs can be enhanced by
gating. This induces a stronger electric field at the SLG/MoS2 interface and promotes charge transfer. Various gating techniques
have been exploited for GRM-based devices, including conventional
Si/SiO2 back-gates,80 high-k
dielectrics (Al2O3, HfO2),81 chemical dopants,82 ionic liquids,83 and PEs.53,74 In order to gate our SLG/1L-MoS2 on PET, we employ the
latter due to its compatibility with flexible substrates84 and the ability to substantially dope SLG (±0.8
eV)53,74 using small gate voltages (up to 4 V), unlike
other gating techniques, which would require considerably higher biases
to reach the same doping.80,82 We use a PE consisting
of LiClO4 and poly(ethylene oxide) (POE).53,74 We place the PE over both the SLG channel and the side-gate electrode.
To evaluate the effect of PE deposition on the SLG channel doping,
we use Raman analysis. We get Pos(G) ∼ 1583 cm–1, FWHM(G) ∼ 19 cm–1, Pos(2D) ∼ 2686
cm–1, and A(2D)/A(G) ∼ 5.3, consistent with
a small reduction of p-doping to ∼230 meV.53,73 For electrical measurements we apply −1 V < VGS < 1 V in order to avoid electrochemical reactions,
such as hydrolysis of residual water in the electrolyte.85,86 These may permanently modify the graphene electrode85,86 and compromise the stability and performance of the device. To control
the stability of the PE gating, we continuously monitor the gate leakage
current (Igate), keeping Igate < 1 nA throughout the experiments. The devices
are tested ∼30 times, showing no degradation in the leakage
current over at least six months.

We then characterize the responsivity
at 642 nm (∼1.93 eV),
slightly above the A exciton peak, where absorption of 1L-MoS2 is maximized (Figure 5b). At 642 nm the SLG/1L-MoS2 heterostructure shows
∼8% absorptance (Figure 5b), and the device retains ∼82% transparency (Figure 5a).

The IDS–VGS measurements
in Figure 6a are done
at room temperature using a probe station
and a parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200). The PD is illuminated at
normal incidence by a collimated laser with Po ranging from 100 μW to 4 mW. At these Po and with VDS = 0.1 V we
measure a positive VCNP ranging from ∼0.39
to 0.47 V, indicating an initial SLG p-doping ∼220 meV, consistent
with the Raman estimate.

Figure 6 (a) Transfer characteristics as a function of Po. (b) Rext as a
function
of VGS and Po. Channel length and width are 100 μm and 2 mm, respectively.

Figure 6a shows
that for −1 V < VGS < 0.5
V, where SLG transport is hole dominated, the current decreases under
illumination (∼10 μA at VGS = −1 V), as anticipated from the band-diagram of Figure 2. For VGS > 0.5 V, where SLG is electron-doped, the PD shows
a small (up to ∼0.2μA) current increase under illumination. Figure 6b plots Rext as a function of VGS,
as derived from transconductance measurements using:19 1  where Ilight and Idark are the PD
current under illumination and
in dark, |Ilight – Idark| = Iph is the photocurrent
defined as the absolute change in the device current upon illumination, Ao is the laser spot area, APD is the PD area, and APD/Ao is a scaling factor that takes into
account the fact that only a fraction of optical power impinges on
the PD. As expected from the band-diagram in Figure 2, Rext tends
to increase for more negative VGS, up
to ∼5.5 A/W at VGS = −1
V, VDS = 0.1 V for Po = 100 μW. By taking into account that only 8% of light
is absorbed (Pabs = 0.08 × Po), we derive Rint = Rext/0.08 = 69A/W. Figure 6b implies that the higher Po, the lower Rext. This can be explained considering that the more photogenerated
electrons are injected into the p-doped channel, the lower the electric
field at the SLG/1L-MoS2 interface, therefore a reduced
injection of electrons causes Rext to
decrease.

Given that Rext,Rint > 1A/W, we expect a photoconductive gain
(GPD),19,87 whereby absorption
of one photon
results in multiple charge carriers contributing to Iph. Our PDs act as optically gated photoconductors, where
the SLG conductance is modulated by optical absorption in the 1L-MoS2. In this configuration, the presence of GPD implies that the injected electrons in SLG can recirculate
multiple times between source and drain, before recombining with trapped
holes in 1L-MoS2. Consequently, GPD can be estimated as the ratio of electrons recombination
(τrec) and transit (ttr) times in the SLG channel: GPD = τrec/ttr.19,21,22,87 For higher VDS, the free carriers drift velocity υd in the SLG channel increases linearly with bias (ohmic region)
until it saturates, because of carriers scattering with optical phonons.88 The linear increase in υd results
in shorter ttr, with ttr = L/υd, where L is the channel length.19,21,22,87 Therefore, GPD is also expected to grow linearly with VDS, providing higher Rext. To confirm the photoconductive nature of GPD in our devices and test the dependence of Rext on VDS, we measure IDS–VDS under
illumination at Po = 100 μW for VGS = −1 V and calculate Rext using eq 1. The IDS–VDS characteristics of the PD show linear dependence, confirming
ohmic behavior of the metal-SLG-metal channel.89 We use VDS < 1 V to keep
the device operation in the linear (ohmic) regime and minimize the
effects of the nonlinear dependence of υd on VDS (such as velocity saturation) that might
appear for VDS > 1 V.88 As shown in Figure 7, Rext scales with VDS and reaches ∼45.5A/W (Rint ∼ 570A/W) at VDS = 1
V. This is almost 1 order of magnitude higher than at VDS = 0.1 V, consistent with the similar increase in VDS. These results are at least 2 orders of magnitude
higher than semiconductor flexible membranes.4,15 Furthermore,
such a combination of high responsivity with μA range photocurrent
surpasses that found in other GRM-based PDs in the visible range.40−45,47 We also fabricate a control device
with a 1L-MoS2 channel only, without SLG. This has Rext ∼ 2 mA/W, which is 4 orders of magnitude
smaller than that of our SLG/1L-MoS2 heterostructure. We
thus conclude that SLG/1L-MoS2 heterostructures are necessary
to achieve high (hundreds A/W) responsivity, due to the presence of
photoconductive gain.

Figure 7 Rext as a function of VDS for Po = 100 μW at VGS = −1 V.

To assess the photoresponse
uniformity in our SLG/1L-MoS2 heterostructures, we perform
photocurrent mapping using the same
laser source (642 nm) as for optoelectronic characterizations. We
scan areas of 80 × 140 μm (pixel size 3 × 3 μm)
at different locations. At each position (pixel) the device photocurrent
is measured for VDS = 0.3 V (Figure 8a). We also collect
the backscattered light to give a reflection map (Figure 8b). Figure 8a indicates that the entire channel area
confined between the source-drain electrodes is photoactive, and shows
uniform photocurrent photoresponse with standard deviation ±15%.
We thus conclude that interface imperfections (e.g., bubbles, polymer residuals, etc.) have
minor effect on the charge transfer process from MoS2 to
graphene.

area (between the electrodes). (b) Reflection map of backscattered
light from the device channel. The yellow areas, corresponding to
the contact areas, show higher reflectance than the substrate (in
blue).

We define GPD as the ratio between
electrons recirculating in the SLG channel, thus sustaining Iph, and the initial electron concentration injected
into SLG from 1L-MoS2:48 2  where q is the electron charge
and Δnch is the concentration per
unit area and per unit time of the injected electrons. Δnch is equal to the trapped-hole concentration
per unit area and per unit time in 1L-MoS2, which is related
to a charge neutrality point shift ΔVGS = ΔVCNP in the transfer characteristics.
To calculate Δnch, we first write
the potential balance in the metal-dielectric-SLG structure. When VGS is applied, it creates a gate-to-channel
potential drop (Vdiel), and it induces
a local electrostatic potential in the graphene channel (Vch = EF/q):19,53 3  where QG and CG are the charge concentration and the geometrical
capacitance per unit area associated with the gate electrode, respectively.
|QG| = |q·nch|, reflecting the charge neutrality of the
gate capacitor, with nch the charge carrier
concentration per unit area in the channel induced by VGS. Any variations of nch change QG and VGS. From
eq 3 we get: 4  which leads to 5  where CQ = dQG/dVch is the SLG
quantum capacitance90,91 that characterizes the changes
of the channel potential ΔVch as
a result of additional gating ΔQG, and (1/CG + 1/CQ)−1 is the total capacitance Ctot.

To calculate QG and Δnch, we first need to find CG and CQ. In PE
gating, CG is associated with the electric
double layer
(EDL) at the SLG/electrolyte interface.53,90,92,93 The EDL acts like a
parallel-plate capacitor with a dielectric layer thickness of the
order of the Debye length λD, so that CG = CEDL = ϵϵ0/ λD, where ϵ is the PE dielectric
constant, and ϵ0 is the vacuum permittivity. In principle,
for a monovalent electrolyte, λD can be explicitly
calculated94 if the electrolyte concentration
is known. However, in the presence of a polymer matrix, the electrolyte
ions can form complexes with polymer chains,95 therefore the precise ion concentration is difficult to measure.
For PE gating, different EDL thicknesses in the range ∼1–5
nm have been reported.53,54,92,93 To estimate CEDL in our devices, we take λD ∼ 2 nm53 and the dielectric constant of the poly(ethylene
oxide) matrix to be ϵ ∼ 5,96 as done in ref (53). As a result, we obtain CEDL = 2.2 ×
10–6 F/cm2. This is the same order of
magnitude as the SLG CQ.90 Therefore, the latter cannot be neglected in eq 5. CQ is given by90 6  where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant,
υF = 1.1 × 106 m/s is the SLG Fermi
velocity,80,97 and ni is the
intrinsic carrier concentration in SLG near the Dirac point induced
by charge impurities, defects and local potential fluctuations in
the SLG channel.90,98−100 From our Raman
and transconductance measurements we estimate ni ∼ 3 × 1012 cm–2.
From eq 6 we then get CQ = 4 × 10–6 F/cm2 at VCNP. From Figure 6a, and extracting ΔVCNP between the dark current and the transfer
curves measured under illumination, and with eq 5, we get Δnch ranging from 4 to 8 × 1011 cm–2 for Po going from 100 μW to 4
mW. As a result, we obtain GPD ∼
5 × 104 at VDS = 0.1 V
for different Po as shown in Figure 9. As discussed previously, GPD becomes larger for higher VDS. Thus, we measure an increase of almost 1 order of
magnitude (GPD ∼ 4 × 105 at Po = 100 μW) for VDS going from 0.1 to 1 V.

Figure 9 GPD as a function of Po at VGS = −1 V and VDS = 0.1 V.

Finally, we test Iph as a function
of bending using a Deben Microtest three-point bending setup (Figure 10a). In this case, rb = [h2 + (L/2)2]/2h, where L is the chord of circumference connecting the
two ends of the arc, and h is the height at the chord
midpoint. The plotted values of Iph in
the bent state at each rb (Iph,bend) are normalized to the values of Iph measured at rest with the sample in the flat position
(Iph,rest). Figure 10b plots the normalized Iph,bend/Iph,rest for different rb, showing deviations
within 15% for rb down to 1.4 cm. This rb is comparable to that reported for semiconductor
membrane PDs,4,15 yet the latter have 2 orders
of magnitude lower (<0.3 A/W) responsivities.4,15 Although
our rb is five times larger than that
reported for flexible single NW devices,3,16−18 the area of our PDs (>40 mm2) is at least 6 orders
of
magnitude larger than that of the NW devices (<5 μm2). To test the device performance upon bending cycles, we first measure
the photocurrent at rest (Iph,rest, flat
position) and then at the smallest rb (Iph,bend, rb∼1.4
cm), repeating these measurements for 30 bending cycles. Figure 10c plots Iph,bend/Iph,rest as a function of bending cycles. This shows that our PDs retain
stable photocurrent after multiple bending tests with a Iph,bend/Iph,rest standard
deviation ±12%.

Conclusions
We reported polymer electrolyte gated, flexible
photodetectors,
for visible wavelengths with external responsivity up to ∼45.5
A/W, photoconductive gain ∼4 × 105, operation
voltage <1 V, and optical transparency >82%. The responsivity
is
at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than in semiconductor flexible
membranes. The devices show stable performance upon bending for radii
of curvature larger than ∼1.4 cm. Owing to their responsivity,
flexibility, transparency, and low operation voltage, our photodetectors
can be attractive for wearable, biomedical, and low-power optoelectronic
applications.11,12,17

Methods
1L-MoS2 is
epitaxially grown by CVD on c-plane sapphire
substrates.61 These are annealed at 1000
°C in air for 1 h after consecutive cleaning by acetone/isopropyl
alcohol/DI water. They are then placed face-down above a crucible
containing ∼5 mg MoO3 (≥99.998% Alfa Aesar).
This is loaded into a 32 mm outer diameter quartz tube placed in a
split-tube three-zone furnace. A second crucible containing 350 mg
sulfur (≥99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) is located upstream
from the growth substrates. Ultrahigh-purity Ar is used as carrier
gas at atmospheric pressure. The procedure is to ramp the temperature
to 300 °C with 200 sccm Ar flow, set to 300 °C for 10 min,
ramp to 700 °C (50 °C/min increase temperature rate) with
10 sccm Ar flow, set at 700 °C for 10 min, cool to 570 °C
with 10 sccm of Ar, increase the gas flow to 200 sccm and open the
furnace for rapid cooling.61 SLG is grown
on a 35 μm Cu foil, following the process described in ref (51). The substrate is annealed
in hydrogen atmosphere (H2, 20 sccm) up to 1000 °C
for 30 min. Then, 5 sccm CH4 is added to initiate growth.51,62 The sample is then cooled in vacuum (1 mTorr) to room temperature
and removed from the chamber.
