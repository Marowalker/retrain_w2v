The
solvent-mediated ability for molecularly encoded self-assembly
into states of higher order (micelles, lyotropic liquid crystals)
embodies the basis for many applications of surfactants in science
and society. Surfactants are used frequently in recipes for nanoparticle
synthesis. Because ordinary surfactants comprise insulating constituents
(alkyl groups as side-chains and charged organic heads), such nanostructures
are wrapped in an electrically inactive barrier, and this is a large
disadvantage for future developments in nanotechnology. Implications
of micelles with electrically conducting walls made from either “metallic”
or “semiconducting” surfactants are huge, also in other
areas such as nanoelectrocatalysis or micellar energy storage. We
cross this frontier by replacing not only the hydrophilic chain but
also the hydrophilic head by electronically conducting entities. We
report the synthesis of surfactants with oligo para-phenylene-ethynylene as a π-conjugated side-chain attached
to a redox-active, inorganic polyoxometalate cluster as charged head.
It is proven that electronic communication between head and tail takes
place. Hybridization on the molecular level leads to the emergence
of advanced surfactant features such as semiconductor properties (Egap = 2.6 eV) in soft lyotropic systems (micelles,
liquid crystals).

==== Body
Molecular architectonics, the
assembly of molecular entities into functional patterns coupling their
properties to the nano-, then to the meso-, and finally to the macroscopic
world, is key for implementing future technologies.1,2 Eventually,
the spontaneous formation of such organized structures takes place
as an intrinsic property of a system containing discrete constituents,
a process termed self-assembly.3,4 A special class of self-assembling
materials are liquid crystals (LCs), because they unify structural
order and a high degree of mobility. This leads to a plethora of properties
as also stated in the seminal article published by Tschierke in 2013.5 Liquid crystals are formed by certain molecular
compounds, and one can distinguish between thermotropic and lyotropic
LCs.

Rising interest was devoted to the self-assembly of π-conjugated
systems because of their large potential in (supra)molecular electronics.6 A prominent application is for instance in field-effect
transistors.7 Several papers have also
reported on the semiconducting features of LC phases formed by these
molecules.8,9 This year (2016) Kim and co-workers have
summarized the potential of LCs based on graphene oxide.10 Most of the described systems belong to thermotropic
phases. A molecular system with lyotropic (solvent-triggered self-assembly)
and amphiphilic properties in combination with electronic conductivity
could feature very interesting properties, for example, micelles as
nanoreactors with electrically active and transmittive shells. Another
important aspect is that surfactants located on the surfaces of nanoparticles
lead to an insulating layer. This is a large disadvantage for numerous
applications of nanoparticles requiring electronic transport.11

Little is known about electrically conducting
surfactants or amphiphiles
in general. Li and co-workers presented in an interesting study a
molecular hybrid of fullerene attached to a polythiophene oligomer.
They showed some amphiphilic properties.12 Hecht and co-workers achieved a meta-phenylene
ethynylene derivative bound to an oligo-ethylene oxide chain as a
hydrophilic constituent of the amphiphile. The authors reported intriguing,
helical self-assembly.13 For an amphiphile,
or finally a surfactant, appointed for molecular electronics, it becomes
clear that the isolating character of typical, hydrophilic headgroups
such as oligo-ethylene-oxide or ammonium is a large disadvantage.
Therefore, a class of surfactants comprising a hydrophobic and electrically
conducting chain and a (hydrophilic) headgroup, which is also capable
of conducting electrons, would represent a major advance.

Recently,
organic–inorganic hybrid surfactants with heads
containing transition metal species were receiving attention because
of their ability to self-assemble could be combined with added properties
characteristic for coordination compounds (magnetic properties, catalytic
activity, etc.).14 Our
group could identify a surfactant class with a pure inorganic head,
namely, a lacunary polyoxometalate (POM) cluster [PW11O39], and conventional alkyl chains as hydrophobic moieties.15−19 From our previous work we know the polytungstate head can be reduced
(for example by electrochemical methods),18 and, in addition, reduced POMs belong to compounds with partially
delocalized electronic systems (Robin–Day classification II).20 Thus, [PW11O39] is a promising
candidate for the desired, electrically conducting headgroup. Obviously
the alkyl chain needs to be exchanged by a conducting entity, e.g., a π-conjugated system. Others
have already shown the attachment of POM species to π-systems
such as dyes (for example, perylene) can be done in general, but their
target was not the synthesis of surfactant species.21−24 Therefore, in our current contribution,
we would like to create a compound with surfactant-like architecture
containing a linear, π-conjugated chain as used in molecular
electronics with a terminal, hydrophilic POM cluster.

Results and Discussion
Surfactant
Preparation
The target compound (3), also noted
as PW11TPE, a lacunary [PW11O39]
polytungstate cluster attached to two para-phenylene
ethynylene trimers via siloxane bridges,
was synthesized as depicted in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the amphiphilic compound with an inorganic
polytungstate
head and π-conjugated side chain.
The alkoxy-silane-modified para-phenylene
ethynylene
derivative (1) required for coupling with the lacunary
POM cluster and its synthesis are described in detail in Supporting Information Figure S-1. The successful
reaction of 1 with [PW11O39]7– (2) was examined by various methods
(see also Supporting Information Figure S-2), but most importantly using 183W-nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS)
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 (a) Molecular
structure of compound 3 as proven from
various analytical data. The color code of the [PW11O39] headgroup marks the symmetry equivalent W atoms appearing
in the 183W NMR spectroscopy (b). (c) Experimental ESIMS
pattern (black) in comparison to the calculated pattern of the molecular
ion 3 (gray).

The isotope lines of the ESIMS signal centered at m/z = 1239 g mol–1 and
recorded
in negative ion mode are separated by 0.33 unit, affirming the charge
of the ion is −3. Thus, the resulting mass of the molecular
species (m × z = 3717 g mol–1) matches nicely the nonfragmented molecular ion 3,
and as a result, there is a perfect match with the theoretically expected
isotope pattern (Figure 1c). In the 183W NMR spectrum shown in Figure 1b one sees the characteristic
2:2:1:2:2:2 pattern of the lacunary [PW11O39] POM cluster bound to two organosiloxane units. Thus, one can infer
the molecular architecture is intact. Also in the 31P NMR
spectroscopy (Figure S-2b) one sees only
one signal (δ = −13.94), which is characteristic for
the central “PO4” unit in [PW11O39] and proves the high purity of the compound. FT-IR
spectroscopy (Figure S-2a) confirms the
latter results, and it can be seen that also the CC triple bonds are
still present (ν̃ = 2150 cm–1). The
presence of the characteristic Si–O–Si vibration (ν̃
= 1110 cm–1) is also in full agreement with the
proposed structure of the surfactant. Therefore, the molecular structure
of the target compound is proven unambiguously.

Investigation
of Self-Organization
Similar to the alkyl-modified
[PW11O39] surfactants (for example (CH3(CH2)14CH2SiO0.5)2[PW11O39]3– (4) as a reference; all reference systems used in this study
are summarized in Supporting Information Figure S-3),15−19 we also expect that compound 3 has amphiphilic properties
because of its dipolar character considering the hydrophilic and charged
headgroup and (two) attached, hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains. Water
is added to 3, and for concentrations c > 1 g/L one still observes a sediment remaining in the test vial.
This indicates the solubility of 3 is lower compared
to classical organic surfactants, e.g., SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), and also the alkyl analogue 4. However, even at c = 0.1 g/L we could
observe the formation of self-assembled structures in water (see Figure 2). In particle size
distribution functions obtained from dynamic light scattering (DLS)
one sees two signals at a hydrodynamic diameter DH = 4.9 and 18 nm (Figure 2a).

Figure 2 (a) Particle size distribution curve obtained from DLS
measurements.

black squares ≅ 3 in aqueous solution; blue, red

are given in Supporting Information Figure S-4. (d) Proposed structure of the aggregates: green ≅ polyhedral

black ≅ organic phenylene ethynylene chains. Cations are omitted.
All dispersions had a concentration of 0.1 g/L of PW11TPE
(3) in water.

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of surfactants such
as
SDS (CMC = 2.3 g/L) or polysorbate 80 (CMC = 0.16 g/L) is typically
larger. Attempts to determine the CMC of PW11TPE precisely
were not successful, because ring tensiometry fails for all surfactants
with highly charged PW11 heads25 and other methods (such as DLS) are no longer sensitive to such
low concentrations (<0.1 g/L). The overall lower solubility and
lower critical aggregation concentration are assigned to the presence
of the π-conjugated chain, which could induce other, stronger
intermolecular interactions in the hydrophobic block such as π–π
bonding. For further clarification, we have performed small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. Considering the Kratky plot
of the SAXS data (see Supporting Information Figure S-4), the shape of the observed aggregates is close to a rigid-rod
morphology, indicated by the linear increase of the curve. Further,
the dimension of the aggregates is DG1 ≈ 6 nm and DG2 ≈ 20 nm
according to the two different slopes obtained from the Guinier analysis
of the data (Figure 2b), which fits nicely with the values obtained from DLS. Images received
from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 2c) are consistent with the
latter results. The impression of “hollow structures”
is typical for self-assembled structures resulting from [PW11O39] surfactants due to the large difference in electronic
density between the headgroup region and the organic tail.15,17 Although there is a large tendency for film formation, the size
distribution of the objects is narrow and the objects are slightly
elongated with dimensions of ∼15–20 nm. Compared to
alkyl-modified surfactants, for example the reference system 4, there are some important differences. DH = 4.9 nm is obviously smaller than the double extension
of PW11TPE (see Figure 1a), and this speaks for a substantial interdigitation
of the hydrocarbon chains. Because the hydrocarbon chain can adopt
only a stretched conformation because of the triple bonds, interdigitation
is problematic since intersection becomes almost unavoidable for any
classical shape of a micelle. However, density functional calculations
show that the two phenylene ethynylene chains do not prefer a parallel
orientation, but there is an angle between them of ∼60°
(see Supporting Information S-5). Considering
this specific geometry of the amphiphile 3, we propose
the special structure of the micellar aggregates shown in Figure 2d. Our suggestion
is in line with the crystal structure of a lacunary Dawson polyoxometalate
cluster bound to a pyrene moiety.23 The
model also accounts for the elongated shape of the aggregates, which
could be a result of the additional π–π interactions
of the phenylene ethynylene moieties. It is important to note that
all structures involving charged surfactants contain substantial amounts
of counterions. For surfactants with polyoxometalate heads this aspect
is crucial because of the high negative charge. We have recently explored
polyoxotungstate surfactants with charges up to −5, and we
saw that not only the choice of cation is important but also surfactants
with charges higher than −3 exhibit unusual self-assembly features
because of the inevitable electrostatic repulsion.25 Here, we have not varied the counterion. Sodium compounds
were used in all cases. We assume that hydrated Na+ remains
in close proximity to the negative headgroup, but the exact position
cannot be resolved as for other systems known in the literature.26−28

The self-assembly at high concentration of PW11TPE (lyotropic
LC) was studied using SAXS and TEM given in Figure 3. The water content in the samples was determined
by thermogravimetric analysis and was found to be 4.7%. At low angles,
two diffraction signals are present, which fit to a hexagonally ordered
cylindrical liquid crystal phase (a = 4.99 nm) (space
group P6mm). In addition,
there is one signal at higher q values (c = 1.14 nm), which we assign to a dense packing of the [PW11O39] headgroups located at the surface of the cylindrical
aggregates (see Figure 3a).

Figure 3 (a) Experimental small-angle X-ray (Cu Kα) diffraction pattern
measured at two different detector distances (circles, squares) and
signals expected (gray bars) for a hexagonal packing of cylinders
(P6mm) with periodicity a and for an additional dense packing of the headgroups
in the single cylinders c. (b) TEM micrograph of solid, dried PW11TPE; scale bar = 100 nm.

However, the internal order is not high, which is signaled
by the
significant width of the SAXS signals. The latter is confirmed by
TEM investigations, for which we could only find a disordered, wormlike
phase (Figure 3b).
Compared to the alkyl derivative as a reference (PW11C16),15 performing electron microscopy
is intricate because PW11TPE undergoes radiation damage
much more easily.

Investigation of Electronic and Electrical
Properties
Now that the amphiphilic properties of PW11TPE (3) have been examined and some self-assembled
structures have
been introduced, the question needs to be answered, if there is any
electronic communication between the redox-active [PW11O39] headgroup and the π-conjugated chain(s). We
studied the electronic properties of 3 in solution first.
As the solubility of PW11TPE is limited in water, electrical
(cyclic voltammetry (CV)) and electronic (UV/vis and photoluminescence
(PL)) characterization was carried out in organic solvents for better
comparison to references (PW11C16, PW11, and TPE) and to meet the required minimal concentrations for the
analytical techniques. Figure 4a shows cyclic voltammetry data of PW11TPE in comparison
to the alkyl analogue PW11C16.

Figure 4 (a) CV data of PW11TPE (3) (green line)
in comparison to PW11C16 (4) as
a reference (gray line). (b) PL spectra of PW11TPE (3) (green squares) and as references PW11 (2) (black circles), PW11C16 (4) (gray hashes), and TPE (5) (blue triangles). The yellow
line marks the excitation wavelength λexc = 405 nm.
(c) Fluorescence decay curves for PW11TPE (3) (green line) in comparison to TPE (5) (blue curve).

Both compounds show two reduction/oxidation
waves due to the redox
pair WVI/WV. Two effects can be seen. The reversibility
of the redox process is limited for PW11C16,
as documented by the second oxidation wave in comparison to the corresponding
reduction wave. Interestingly, for PW11TPE the redox reversibility
has increased significantly. Further, the reduction waves have shifted
to lower potentials (−840 to −750 mV), meaning the transfer
of one electron to the headgroup is eased.

It can be reasoned
there is clearly an effect of the π-conjugated
chain attached to the [PW11O39] headgroup. Photoluminescence
measurements also show an influence of the attached π-conjugated
chain (Figure 4b).
Whereas there is no or only limited signal for PW11 (2) and PW11C16 (4), the
presence of the TPE chain leads to a noticeable fluorescence signal
in the VIS region. Attaching the [PW11O39] moiety
to the TPE chain induces a red-shift of the fluorescence by Δλmax = 18 nm. From fluorescence lifetime measurements (Figure 4c) one sees there
is clearly a biexponential decay for PW11TPE and the related
relaxation constants are markedly different (see fits given in Supporting Information Figure S-6). Because the
electronic system of [PW11O39] is very different
from the organic TPE chain, it is expected that disparate decay constants
exist. Because excitation is based on the adsorption band of TPE,
the occurrence of both decays is an indication of the successful transfer
of the excited state from the chain to the headgroup. The bare TPE
chain (for better comparison also fitted by a biexponential curve)
compares well to the slower decay rate of PW11TPE, and
the second component is much faster. Since it is known that fluorescence
lifetimes are influenced by the presence of heavy atoms, the latter
results can be interpreted as an additional evidence for the delocalization
of the photogenerated, excited state from the π-conjugated chain
to the polyoxometalate headgroup containing the heavy W atoms. We
wanted to gain further, independent confirmation of the latter by
using spectroelectrochemical (SEC) IR measurements (see Supporting Information Figure S-7). We expected
a shift of the C≡C stretching vibration because of the occupation
of antibonding orbitals, when an electron of a reduced [PW11O39] headgroup would eventually hop to the π-conjugated
chain. Clearly there is no shift, and as a result, one has to assume
the transfer of electrons from the headgroup to the chain in solution
is at least aggravated. Several factors can be responsible for this:
First, one has to consider the reduction of conjugated π-systems
is in general not favorable.29 Then, in
solution rotation of the chain about the Si–Csp2 bond is possible, and therefore the chances for overlap between
the head and the π-system are reduced.

Therefore, it makes
sense to investigate the described solid-state
structure of 3 next. As expected, it can be seen that
“bare” TPE is a yellow compound with an adsorption maximum
at λmax = 399 nm (Ehν = 3.1 eV). The “bare” [PW11O39] also absorbs in the UV (Figure 5). Considering a “particle
in a box model”, the significant red-shift of the absorption
band of PW11OTPE compared to TPE can be explained by an
extension of the electronic system. Further, one sees the band of 3 is significantly broader, and this is indicative for a bigger
dispersion of the density of states (DOS) function. This and the fact
that the optical properties of 3 in solution differ so
much suggest that PW11TPE in its solid state has less molecular
character and is gaining semiconducting properties. As a result, charge
carriers can be delocalized over dimensions larger than just the molecular
scale. This theory is confirmed by PL measurements shown in Supporting Information Figure S-8. While pure
TPE (5) is characterized by several distinct fluorescence
features, all signals are quantitatively quenched for 3. We explain this by the increased delocalization of the excited
state also to the headgroup region and fluorescence quenching because
of the high atomic number of W, in addition to the known “self-quenching”
effect, due to excimer formation in high-concentration samples.30

TPE chain (right). (b) UV/vis spectra of 3 in the solid
state (green squares) and as references solid TPE (blue triangles)
and [PW11O39]Na7 (black circles)

function. The absorption spectrum of 3 in solution is
shown as well (green line). (c) By attachment of the lacunary [PW11O39] cluster (left) to the TPE chain (right),
one obtains a liquid crystalline semiconductor (middle) with a band
gap in the visible range.

Final proof that PW11TPE truly is a semiconductor
comes
from current–voltage measurements and from testing the materials
as a photoconductor (Figure 6). One sees that PW11TPE shows the typical I/V behavior of semiconductors. The asymmetry
in the graph (Figure 6a) is presumably due to the possible redox process (reduction of
the head; see above). When PW11TPE is irradiated with light,
because of its semiconducting character, excitons (electron–hole
pairs) are formed, and this increases the electrical conductivity
of the material. Therefore, we can note an increase in current that
quickly ceases when the light is turned off. Interestingly, afterward
the resistance seems to be slightly higher than before but then recovers
over time. When considering the results from PL and photosensor experiments
together, it gets obvious that very interesting semiconducting properties
arose from the presented hybrid material in LC phase. The determined
band gap of 2.6 eV is very similar to established semiconductors such
as ZnSe (2.7 eV), which opens the door for manifold applications.

measurement for PW11TPE. The period when the material was
exposed to light is marked by the yellow bars.

Conclusions
In the current paper not only do we show
that π-conjugated
systems can be used for constructing soft semiconductors via thermotropic liquid crystals, but the presented organic–inorganic
hybrid amphiphile allows entering the world of lyotropic, soft semiconductors.
Because the set of analytical techniques is different for the micellar
state and the LLC phase, it is very hard to compare the results directly.
But it was shown that the type of aggregation also has an influence
on the degree of electronic delocalization. When there is less conformational
freedom of the π-conjugated chain with respect to the polyoxometalate
head (in the solid state), delocalization is improved. It has also
been demonstrated that in condensed phases intermolecular charge transfer
between adjacent surfactants is possible and that this contributes
to the semiconductor features.

When imagining possible applications
of our materials, a first
idea is to relate to classical semiconductors with similar gap energy
(e.g., ZnSe).31,32 However, compared to semiconductor quantum dots, a soft semiconductor
like that presented here is fundamentally different. Therefore, our
system should not be seen as an alternative to inorganic nanoparticles.
It is much more promising to identify possibilities benefiting from
the features of the presented system. These are the surfactant characteristics
and the presence of the polyoxometalate group. Tempting ideas are
to use conducting surfactants for surface stabilization of nanoparticles,
enabling direct interparticle charge transfer, or to explore the option
for the generation of self-organizing photovoltaic films. In combination
with the idea of electrically conducting micelles and considering
the catalytic activity of heteropolyoxometalates we want to approach
innovative routes in electrocatalysis. When redox-active compounds
are confined in micelles with conductive walls, one can also imagine
finding possible applications in energy storage by charge storage
and transport via reduction and oxidation. However,
before these perspectives can be realized, most importantly the solubility
in water has to be improved, for example by attaching side-chains
to the π-backbone. In addition, more advanced physical measurements
are planned to understand the mechanism of charge generation and transport
in these systems.

mg, 0.2 mmol): 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ (ppm) = 8.0–5.5 (very broad, 28H, aromatic
and vinylic protons), 3.13 (s, 36H, NMe4+),
1.09 (broad, 42H, TIPS); 29Si NMR (79 MHz, MeCN-d3) δ (ppm) = −1.33 (TIPS), −63.33; 31P NMR (162 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ
(ppm) = −13.60; 183W NMR (25 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ (ppm) = −97.08 (2W), −101.29
(2W), −106.19 (1W), −119.06 (2W), −195.17 (2W),
−245.99 (2W). IR (ATR): 1110 (Si–O–Si), 1064
(P–O), 1054 (P–O), 1035 (P–O), 996, (W=O),
985 (W=O), 959 (W=O), 865 (W–O–W), 806
(W–O–W), 788 (W–O–W) [cm–1]; ESIMS PW11-TPE·DMSO measured m/z = 1265.244 08 (simulation: 1265.229 04);
PW11-TPE·2MeCN measured m/z = 1266.590 49 (simulation: 1266.584 78).

Ion Exchange
with Na-PW11-TPE
Cations were
exchanged with Na+ by slow filtration of a 5 mg/mL solution
of TMA-POM in acetonitrile through a column packed with Amberlite-IR120-Na.
The success of the exchange was controlled via1H NMR (no peak at δ = 3.23 ppm any more).

Preparation
of High-Concentration Phases
A dispersion
of 100 mg of PW11TPE in water was prepared. Acetonitrile
was added until full homogenization had taken place. Due to its lower
boiling point (82 °C) compared to water, it is removed in a second
step slowly under vacuum. The content of water can be controlled by
the evaporation time, and its content was investigated using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA).

Analytical Methods
NMR measurements
(1H, 13C, 29Si, 31P) were
performed on a Varian
Unity INOVA 400 spectrometer. The 183W NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer with 10 mm NMR
tubes. ESIMS data were acquired on a Bruker microtof II system. The
solutions were injected directly into the evaporation chamber. SAXS
was acquired on a Bruker Nanostar system equipped with pinhole collimation
and Cu Kα radiation. The samples were placed between X-ray transparent
foils and were measured in an evacuated chamber. Liquid samples were
sealed in 1 mm Mark tubes made of soda lime glass. TEM was acquired
on a Zeiss Libra 120 system and a JEOL JEM-2200FS. The dry sample
was placed directly on carbon-coated copper grids. IR spectroscopy
was performed on a PerkinElmer 100 system. UV/vis spectroscopy was
performed on a Varian Cary 100. Dynamic light scattering was measured
on a Viscotek 802 DLS machine. Photosensor measurements were performed
on 3 mm × 3 mm sensor substrates from Umweltsensortechnik and
measured with a Zahner IM6 potentiostat. A solution of Na-PW11-TPE in acetonitrile/water (5/1) solution was subsequently dropped
onto the substrate and allowed to dry. Fluorescence spectroscopy was
performed on a FluoTime 3000. All experiments were performed with
λex = 405 nm. Because signals were too noisy in pure
water due to the low concentration of PW11TPE, solutions
with higher concentration (c = 5 g/L) were prepared
using THF. Cyclic voltammetry was measured with an Epsilon-potentiostat
(BASi) (reference electrode: Ag/Ag+ wire; counter electrode:
Pt wire; scan rate: 100 mV/s). Because signals were too noisy in pure
water due to the low concentration of PW11TPE, solutions
with higher concentration (c = 1 g/L) were prepared
using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). TGA was recorded using a Netzsch
TG 203 instrument.
