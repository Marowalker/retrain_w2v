Hybrid organic–inorganic and
fully inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have recently
emerged as versatile solution-processable light-emitting and light-harvesting
optoelectronic materials. A particularly difficult challenge lies
in warranting the practical utility of such semiconductor NCs in the
red and infrared spectral regions. In this context, all three archetypal
A-site monocationic perovskites—CH3NH3PbI3, CH(NH2)2PbI3, and
CsPbI3—suffer from either chemical or thermodynamic
instabilities in their bulk form. A promising approach toward the
mitigation of these challenges lies in the formation of multinary
compositions (mixed cation and mixed anion). In the case of multinary
colloidal NCs, such as quinary CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs, the outcome
of the synthesis is defined by a complex interplay between the bulk
thermodynamics of the solid solutions, crystal surface energies, energetics,
dynamics of capping ligands, and the multiple effects of the reagents
in solution. Accordingly, the rational synthesis of such NCs is a
formidable challenge. Herein, we show that droplet-based microfluidics
can successfully tackle this problem and synthesize CsxFA1–xPbI3 and CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs in both a time- and cost-efficient manner.
Rapid in situ photoluminescence and absorption measurements
allow for thorough parametric screening, thereby permitting precise
optical engineering of these NCs. In this showcase study, we fine-tune
the photoluminescence maxima of such multinary NCs between 700 and
800 nm, minimize their emission line widths (to below 40 nm), and
maximize their photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (up to 89%)
and phase/chemical stabilities. Detailed structural analysis revealed
that the CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs adopt a cubic perovskite structure of FAPbI3, with iodide anions partially substituted by bromide ions.
Most importantly, we demonstrate the excellent transference of reaction
parameters from microfluidics to a conventional flask-based environment,
thereby enabling up-scaling and further implementation in optoelectronic
devices. As an example, CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs with an emission maximum
at 735 nm were integrated into light-emitting diodes, exhibiting a
high external quantum efficiency of 5.9% and a very narrow electroluminescence
spectral bandwidth of 27 nm.

==== Body
Lead halide perovskites (LHP) of the
APbX3 type, where A can be methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), formamidinium (FA, CH3(NH2)2+), inorganic cations (Cs+, Rb+), or a mixture thereof and X is a halide (Br, I,
and their mixtures), have attracted enormous attention after they
were recognized as efficient thin-film absorber materials for photovoltaics,
with power conversion efficiencies of up to 22.7%.1−4 Recently, there has been a surge
of studies on the nanoscale counterparts of these perovskites and,
in particular, on colloidal nanocrystals (NCs),5−12 which hold great promise as versatile photonic sources for displays,
lighting, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and lasers13−16 and as light harvesters for solar
cells and photodetectors.1,17 Unlike other forms
of APbX3 perovskites—bulk single and polycrystals,
thin films, and other substrate-grown structures—colloidal
NCs have a particular set of advantages, foremost of which is their
versatile solution processability and miscibility with other materials,
as well as access to quantum-size effects and their facile surface-
and shape-engineering.18 To date, essentially
all work on colloidal APbX3 NCs has concentrated on those
compositions, which emit in the visible region of the electromagnetic
spectrum (between 400 and 700 nm), with CsPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 NCs, exhibiting green photoluminescence (PL, between 500
and 550 nm), being by far the most popular targets. This can be attributed
to the high durability of these bromides, as compared to other compositions
in the APbX3 family.

In the current study, we focus
our attention on multinary perovskite NCs of the quinary composition
CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3, with a view to controlling their optical properties
in the near-infrared (700–800 nm). It should be noted that
there is extensive literature regarding red and near-infrared emissive
colloidal MAPbI3 NCs, refs (7) and (19)–23 being representative examples.
However, MAPbI3 NCs suffer from severe instabilities caused
by humidity, light, and heat and eventually decompose into CH3NH2, PbI2, HI, and I2.22,24,25 Fully inorganic CsPbX3 NCs (X = Cl, Br, and I), synthesized by a hot injection method,
exhibit tunable emission between 410 and 700 nm and high PL quantum
efficiencies (50–90%).6 Presently,
CsPbX3 NCs are the focus of attention with respect to their
chemical engineering (i.e., identification of precursors,
growth kinetics, shape-control, postsynthetic reactivity, and up-scaling),20,26−45 surface chemistry,8,46−50 photophysics (single-dot spectroscopy, lasing, etc.),51−59 and applications in television displays,6,60−62 light-emitting devices,50,63−68 and solar cells.17 The usability of red-emissive
CsPbX3 NCs is, however, strongly limited by the phase instability
of the 3D polymorphs of CsPbI3. For similar reasons, iodide-rich
CsPb(Br/I)3 compositions are also unstable. As for FA-based
analogues, which benefit from the higher chemical stability of the
FA ion (compared to that of MA+), one-pot colloidal syntheses
have led to the development of stable and highly emissive FA-doped
CsPbI3 NCs (PL peak at ca. 690 nm; ca. 10% FA) and FAPbI3 NCs (PL peak at ca. 780 nm),69 with cubic or
nearly cubic NC shapes and mean particle sizes between 10 and 20 nm.
Interestingly, unlike colloidal FAPbI3 NCs, bulk FAPbI3 is completely unstable due to a phase transition from semiconductive
perovskite into a yellow, nonperovskite phase (an observation that
will be further discussed in the Results and Discussion section of this study). A formidable challenge with iodide-based
NCs lies in discovering the compositional space and related synthesis
parameters that would provide for continuous coverage of the 700–800
nm spectral range with narrow PL line widths and without compromising
the chemical durability of the NCs.

Our choice of the quinary
composition, CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3, was motivated by previous
thin-film and bulk single-crystal studies,70−74 which indicate that the concomitant incorporation
of Cs and Br into the FAPbI3 lattice stabilizes the 3D
perovskite phase and allows for the compositional tuning of band-gap
energy through the formation of mixed-halide solid solutions.75 With monohalide FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs, the only way to access
the entire 700–800 nm range is to exploit quantum-size effects
and reduce NC size to the 3–8 nm range. Such small NCs are
highly labile morphologically, and their PL characteristics are consequently
broad and unstable.76

In the case
of NCs, accessing suitable reaction parameters for the formation of
stable CsxFA1–xPbX3 NCs with tunable emission maxima in the range
of 700–780 nm is simply not possible with flask reactions.69 Specifically, in a recent study on the formation
of mixed-anion FAPbX3 NCs, it was reported that variation
in the Br–I content led solely to two stable compositions,
one emitting at 680 nm and the other at 760 nm.69 This is due to the fact that in NCs the ability to form
certain compositions is governed not only by the thermodynamics of
the mixed-ion phases but also by the NC surfaces (i.e., surface energy and ligand binding) and chemical equilibria with
the precursors in the solution. These factors greatly expand relevant
parametric space beyond the mixing ratios of the Cs, FA, Pb, and halide
precursors, thus making thorough exploratory synthesis and optimization
virtually impossible with conventional flask-based techniques.

Recently, we showcased the potential of droplet-based microfluidics
combined with online absorption and PL spectroscopy in discovering
the optimal synthesis parameters for ternary and quaternary (mixed-anion)
CsPbX3 NCs77 and FAPbX378,79 NCs. The next logical step, which is pursued in this
work, is the exploration of NCs of higher compositional complexity, i.e., CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs. In such cases,
the use of high-throughput automated microfluidic reactors becomes
an absolute necessity for rapid and detailed experimentation. Using
microfluidics, we herein demonstrate the formation of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs with PL peak tuning between 690 and 780 nm and narrow
PL line widths (expressed as full width at half-maximum, fwhm). Characterization
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and elemental analysis pointed to the incorporated
quantities of Cs (0.1–1.2% with respect to FA) and Br (10–18%
with respect to I). The obtained CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs were approximately cubic
in shape, with a mean size of 8–13 nm. The reaction parameters
were fully transferrable from our microfluidic platform (pL–nL
scale) to conventional reaction flasks (mL scale). This allows us
to demonstrate the optoelectronic utility of these NCs by fabricating
near-infrared LEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to
5.9% at 735 nm.

Results and Discussion
Formability of APbI3
To obtain red to near-infrared emissive CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 compositions,
the structural chemistry of these perovskites must be considered:
only those polymorphs of APbI3 compounds that retain three-dimensional
(3D) corner-shared interconnections of lead halide octahedra are potent
semiconductors. The extended electronic structure in lead halide perovskites
arises from the periodic 3D network of PbX6 octahedra.
Low-dimensionality polymorphs of the same composition exhibit higher
(by at least 1 eV) and often indirect band gaps, typically on the
order of 300–500 nm. 3D polymorphs of all archetypal ternary
APbI3 compounds have stability issues. MAPbI3 is chemically unstable, whereas the 3D polymorphs of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 are thermodynamically metastable and undergo
transitions into 1D polymorphs (Figure 1).76,80−85 Interestingly, the thin-film and nanoscale forms of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 exhibit extended but still finite stability
in their 3D polymorph forms (from days to several months), primarily
due to surface effects.6,32,69,86−88

Figure 1 Formabilities of the 3D and 1D polymorphs of
CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 compounds and the goal of
this study: near-infrared emissive LHP NCs. The PbI6 octahedra
of α-FAPbI3 NCs are assembled in a 3D cubic metastable
lattice, which spontaneously converts into a 1D hexagonal version
(nonluminescent) at room temperature. In the case of CsPbI3, the PbI6 octahedra of FAPbX3 NCs are assembled
in a 3D orthorhombic metastable lattice (γ-phase), which eventually
converts at room temperature into a 1D orthorhombic δ-phase
(nonluminescent). The goal of this study is highlighted with a question:
can high-throughput microfluidic screening identify the existence
of stable multinary CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 phases in the form of colloidal NCs, which cover
the PL region of 700–800 nm, i.e., in-between ternary 3D phases (CsPbI3 and FAPbI3)? We note that bulk α-FAPbI3 emits at 840
nm and γ-CsPbI3 emits at 710 nm, whereas their NC
counterparts are commonly reported to emit at ≤700 and ≤780
nm, respectively.6,8−12,69 It is also noted that
the space groups reported for the γ- and δ-phases of CsPbI3 do not differ (while their structures manifestly do), as
they can easily be interconverted by simple axis permutations. We
used the original Pbnm and Pnma for
the γ- and δ-forms, respectively, to maintain consistency
with past literature.

Thermodynamic
instability is caused by the Cs and FA ions being, respectively, slightly
too small and too large for the voids in between PbI6 octahedra.
This has been broadly discussed in the literature in terms of the
Goldsmith tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor
(μ), which describe the optimal dense packing of charged ions
in an ideal cubic 3D perovskite.72,89−93 Mixing larger and smaller ions at the A-site is a powerful strategy
for adjusting the geometric fitness of the A-cation in the void space
of the 3D lead halide framework, thereby improving its phase stability.
A high entropy of mixing is also considered to be a stabilizing factor.71 In fact, the best phase stabilities and optoelectronic
performances have been reported for thin films with such mixed A-site
occupations: FA/MA,94−97 Cs/MA,98 Cs/FA,70−73 Cs/MA/FA,99 or even Rb/Cs/MA/FA.4

Toward
Multinary APbX3 Perovskites: The Goal of This Investigation
Covering the desired spectral range of 700–800 nm requires
broad mapping in Cs-FA perovskites, because 3D CsPbI3 and
FAPbI3 exhibit band gaps of 1.75 eV (710 nm) and 1.48 eV
(840 nm), respectively. From the viewpoint of structural chemistry,
it remains unclear which crystal structures will be adopted or are
stable when Cs:FA and Br:I ratios are adjusted simultaneously, as
the parent Cs and FA compounds have different 3D polymorph structures
(Figure 1). We recently
found that for bulk single crystals, in accordance with previous studies
on thin films starting with α-FAPbI3, one can concomitantly
introduce up to 15% Cs and 30% Br, while maintaining the same cubic
crystal structure as α-FAPbI3.74 As for colloidal NCs, we recently reported the synthesis
of a mixed-cationic composition, Cs0.9FA0.1PbI3, with the same crystal structure as orthorhombic 3D γ-CsPbI3, via a flask-based process.69 Multiple variations of the Cs:FA reagent ratio and synthesis
temperatures led to the same composition (with ca. 10% FA). From these studies, it can be surmised that the exploration
of complex compositions is prohibitively difficult via flask-based syntheses. This is because with one iteration of only
one parameter per synthesis (each lasting several hours when conducted
manually) several years will be required to properly map compositional
space and other factors, such as the effects of ligands, solvents,
and solvation equilibria.

Experimental Design and Combinatorial Strategy
Microfluidic
reactors allow for the addition of multiple reagents in a user-defined
manner, rapid thermal and mass transfer, and quantitative kinetic
investigation of reactions, thus defining an ideal medium for preparing
semiconductor NCs with well-defined morphologies and physicochemical
properties.100−103 In addition, the advances in robust microfluidic configurations,100,103 real-time detection methods,104−111 continuous purification112,113 and ligand-exchange114 systems, and optimization algorithms115−117 make microfluidic reactors ideal for the detailed investigation
of rapid and complex reaction kinetics77,78,106,118 and for the discovery
of multicomponent semiconductor NCs.77,78,119

Herein, we modified and applied a previously
developed microfluidic platform that had been used for the synthesis
and real-time characterization of binary chalcogenide NCs106 and CsPbX3 NCs.77 This platform (see Figure 2 and associated description in the Methods section) incorporates a multiphase microfluidic reactor
with integrated PL and absorption detection to rapidly screen reaction
conditions. The controlled injection of precursor solutions (Cs-oleate,
FA-oleate, PbX2, and PbY2) and carrier fluid
is performed in an automated manner (using syringe pumps), allowing
for the formation of nanoliter droplets using a seven-port manifold
and efficient mixing of precursors (in ∼300 ms).77 In the case of CsxFA1–xPbX3 (X = Br and
I) NCs, we defined four interdependent molar ratios, which were adjusted
during synthesis: FA/Pb, Cs/Pb, Br/I, and Cs/FA. In this report, the
latter is presented as the Cs percentage relative to the FA content.
A tube-based microfluidic reactor allows for rapid heating of the
droplets (within a few hundred ms), along with the real-time extraction
of PL and absorption characteristics at various reaction times (0.1–20
s) and temperatures (25–130 °C). Additional characterization
of the synthesized NCs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
XRD was conducted in an off-line manner, by collecting a sufficient
quantity of the sample during synthesis at a fixed set of reaction
conditions (see the Methods section for details).
The optimized parameters were then transferred to conventional flask-based
reactions.

Figure 2 (Left) Illustration of the segmented-flow reaction platform equipped
with online PL and absorbance modules for the synthesis and real-time
monitoring of CsxFA1–xPbX3 perovskite NCs. The microfluidic
platform allows for a systematic and independent variation of precursor
molar ratios, such as Cs/Pb, FA/Pb, Cs/FA, and Br/I, growth times
(determined by the flow rate and tube lengths), and temperature. Droplets
are generated by adjusting the flow rates of the carrier phase (50–200
μL/min) and that of the dispersed phase (1.2–50 μL/min).
(Right) Illustration of a typical flask-based hot-injection synthesis
of CsxFA1–xPbX3 NCs. Overall, synthesis optimization was performed
by mutual information exchange between flask-based experimentation
(identification of suitable precursors, solvents, and capping ligands)
and microfluidics (optimization of the reaction parameters). The optimized
reaction parameters were successfully transferred from microfluidics
back into flask reactors, followed by up-scaling and additional postsynthetic
characterization (XRD, electron microscopy, and stability tests).

Synthesis of CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs
In our previous study, we showed that FAPbI3 NCs can grow
even at room temperature,78 while CsPbI3 NCs with a 3D phase are formed at temperatures above 100
°C.77 Accordingly, we decided that
analyzing the temperature range suitable for the formation of CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs was an important initial task. Figure 3a–c report the variation in emission
line width and PL peak at 25–130 °C (FA/Pb = 9.3, Cs/Pb
= 0.3, and %Cs = 3.0). The formation of FAPbI3 NCs takes
place at room temperature, which can be inferred by the emergence
of the PL peak at 792 nm, consistent with a previous flask-based synthetic
study, in which 15 nm FAPbI3 NCs exhibited a PL peak at
780 nm.69 Higher temperatures led to a
rapid increase in the band-gap energy, which we ascribe to the incorporation
of Cs. The possibility of smaller NC sizes (quantum dots 3–10
nm in diameter) causing larger band gaps can be discounted using postsynthesis
TEM images, with all NCs obtained in this study for growth times greater
than 7 s being 15–20 nm in size. Size evolution occurs very
quickly and over the course of several seconds. From 50 to 90 °C,
the PL peak remained stable at 740–745 nm (Figure 3c), but with a gradually decreasing
fwhm. Higher synthesis temperatures (>110 °C) resulted in
PL peaks closer to 700 nm, most likely due to the formation of ternary
CsPbI3 NCs with or without minimal incorporation of FA
ions. Accordingly, we concluded that the 50–90 °C range
is ideal for compositional engineering purposes.

function of temperature for Cs0.03FA0.97PbI3 NCs (with the variation in the Cs/FA molar ratio indicated).
Other parameters were as follows: FA/Pb = 9.3, Cs/Pb = 0.3, and reaction
time = 10 s. (d–f) Temporal evolution of the normalized online
PL spectra, PL maxima, and fwhm of Cs0.02FA0.98PbI3 NCs at 80 °C.

The high speed
of formation of Cs0.02FA0.98PbI3 NCs
is on par with FAPbX3 (see ref (78) and Figure S1) and
CsPbI3 (reported previously),77 taking only a few seconds to stabilize the PL maximum at 740 nm
and the fwhm at 52 nm (Figure 3d–f). Off-line optical characterization after synthesis
indicates that there is no subsequent growth or other form of evolution
in the CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs (see Figure S2). Based on these observations, further rapid automated screening,
at a rate of 100 adjustments per synthesis parameter per hour, was
carried out with reaction times of at least (and typically) 7 s.

The efficiency of Cs incorporation is expected to depend not only
on temperature but also on the solvation conditions and Cs/FA ratio
and to some extent on the Cs/Pb and FA/Pb ratios. Because these relationships
are not fully and rationally predictable when the equilibrium constants
and involved energies (lattice energies for all compositions, solvation
energies, surface energies, and ligand binding energies) are not completely
known, they were tested in this study in a combinatorial fashion (Figures S3–S6). In brief, for excess FA
(by a factor of 6 with respect to Pb), a narrow fwhm can be obtained
(Figure S3). At much higher FA/Pb ratios
(>13), the crystal phase of the NCs tends to change from black
to yellow within hours of synthesis. The TEM images revealed severe
morphological irregularities in such NCs, which were in the form of
large populations of micrometer-sized needles and rods (Figure S4). Furthermore, the PL tunability of
CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs was limited to Cs/Pb ratios lower than 2 and
Cs loadings of ≤10% (Figure S3).
Outside this window, the PL maxima were always in the range of 680–700
nm, suggesting the formation of pure CsPbI3 NCs or their
mixtures with other compositions (seen as multi-Gaussian PL lines;
see Figure S3e, for Cs content equal to
23.3%) or perhaps even mixtures of various shapes. The TEM images
(Figure S4, S5) illustrate how the three interlinked
ratios affect the morphology of the synthesized CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs.
Progressive addition of 0.3–5.2% Cs+ (with respect
to the FA content) continuously tunes the PL maximum from 758 to 710
nm (Figure S6), while maintaining a narrow
fwhm in the range of 48–55 nm. Although the XRD results suggest
that mixed perovskites adopt a structure similar to that of pure FAPbI3 (Figure S7), the majority of CsxFA1–xPbI3 NC samples exhibited low colloidal and chemical stabilities,
except those samples with both low FA/Pb ratios (≤7) and low
Cs loadings (up to 2%).

Synthesis of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs
The addition
of Br into the system was then explored as a way of stabilizing crystal
structure and tuning the PL maximum in the desired range (700–800
nm). The operating temperature and reaction times were similar to
those used for the synthesis of CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs. As the addition
of a second halide further increases the complexity of the synthetic
system and can shift the product equilibrium toward other perovskite
compositions, parametric screening must be performed with caution.
We therefore broadly explored the influence of the interdependent
molar ratios of Cs/Pb, FA/Pb, and Br– content on
the optical properties and stability of the Br/I mixtures (as illustrated
in Figures S8–S10). In brief, such
a combinatorial study revealed that the parametric zones of the FA/Pb
and Cs/Pb molar ratios, able to tune the PL peak between 690 and 780
nm (while maintaining a satisfactory fwhm), were 2.5–6.0 and
0.01–0.04, respectively (Figure S9). In addition, Br loading of up to 15% leads to a linear blue shift
of the emission band at all FA/Pb molar ratios (Figure S10). A key message here is that in nearly all optimized
compositions Br addition does not alter the emission line width or
emission intensity, suggesting that the synthesized NCs have stable
optical characteristics. Furthermore, an increase in Br– loading over 25% will deliver perovskite NCs with emission energies
in the range of 650–720 nm. However, such an increase in Br– loading can trigger the formation of other perovskite
structures, such as FAPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs, due to excess FA-oleate
in the reaction system (Figure S11).

Figure 4a presents selected PL spectra in the range
of 690 to 775 nm, with fwhm in the range of 45–65 nm. Such
precise PL tuning is achieved through a systematic variation of all
three interlinked molar ratios within their refined parametric zones.
In particular, variation in Cs (in the range of 0.2–5.2%) and
Br (between 0% and 15% of the total halide concentration) content
leads to a blue shift in the in-line (i.e., postheating
and when the reaction was quenched) absorption and PL spectra (Figure 4b). Most importantly,
the incorporation of up to 15% Br– into the structure
of CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs increased the period of stability of the
CsxFA1–xPbI3 NCs from several hours to several weeks (Figure S12).

Cs+ and Br– in the reaction mixture.

Transfer to Flask-Based
Synthesis
To assess whether the optimal parameters can be
transferred to conventional flask reactors, we carried out hot-injection
synthesis of both CsxFA1–xPbI3 and CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs (further
details are provided in the Methods section).
Briefly, to synthesize NCs with the nominal composition of Cs0.01FA0.99Pb(Br0.11I0.89)3 (Figure 5),
PbI2 (55 mg, 0.12 mmol) and PbBr2 (5 mg, 0.014
mmol) were suspended in 1-octadecene (ODE, 4.6 mL), heated to 60 °C,
and then dried under vacuum for 30 min. Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was heated to 110 °C in a nitrogen environment, followed
by the addition of dried solvents: oleylamine (OLA, 0.5 mL) and oleic
acid (OA, 1.0 mL). Once the PbI2 dissolved, the reaction
mixture was cooled to 80 °C. At this point, a mixture of FA oleate
(4.8 mL) and Cs oleate (1.2 mL) stock solutions was injected into
the reaction flask. After 5 s, the reaction was quenched. The crude
solution was then centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The
precipitate was dissolved in hexane, and the resulting solution was
centrifuged once again, after which the supernatant and precipitate
were separated. The particles from both fractions, supernatant and
precipitate, were further washed to remove excess organic ligands
(see further details in the Methods section).
This synthesis procedure yielded nearly cubic NCs with a PL peak at
730 nm (Figure 5a–c),
a PL fwhm of 40 nm (after isolation and purification), and a PL quantum
yield (QY) of 80–89%. QY drops to ca. 50%
in the solid-state form (NC film). We note that the larger fwhm values
detected in-line in microfluidics can be attributed to size-fractioning
that occurs during isolation and purification.

perovskite structure of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs (space group Pm3̅m, with y = 0.87 and x = 0), in which the perovskite framework consists of PbX6 units sharing the octahedral corners; the X– anions are disordered in four equivalent positions.

Crystal Structure
To uncover the structural details of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs, synchrotron X-ray
total scattering measurements were performed (using an octane solution
of NCs in a quartz capillary, Figure 5c) at the X04SA-MS4 Powder Diffraction Beamline of
the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, CH).120 A combined Rietveld and total scattering approach
based on the Debye scattering equation (DSE, accounting for structure,
size, and anisotropic morphology)121 was
used for structural and microstructural characterization of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs (details
are provided in the Supporting Information). The analysis results suggest a cubic structure in which X– anions are disordered in four equivalent sites around
the equilibrium position (inset of Figure 5c), similar to the disorder seen in FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3 NCs.69,122 The atomic
displacement parameters (in the form of the Debye–Waller factor)
were refined for all atoms; the anomalously high values for halides
in the unsplit cubic arrangement suggest local structural disorder.
The graphical outcomes of the DSE-based analysis of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs are
summarized in Figures 5c, S13, and S14. In a similar manner to
CsPbX3 NCs,12 the peak positions
slightly deviate from the cubic metric. Nevertheless, the hybrid NCs
investigated here exhibited a different kind of structural defectiveness,
which needs further investigation. In addition, to further validate
our findings, we compared the experimental data with a Pnma orthorhombic structure model (Figure S15).123 The Pnma structure
does not reproduce the experimental peak intensities; at the same
time, new peaks appear in a simulation, without having a counterpart
in the experimental data, thus supporting the analysis presented in Figure 5c. To investigate
the substitutional disorder between the FA1–x/Csx and Br1–y/Iy couples, the corresponding site occupancy
factors (s.o.f.) were refined by the conventional Rietveld method,
and the resulting values (x = 0; y = 0.87) were kept fixed during DSE-based modeling. The Br/I substitution
value is consistent with the PL peak position and with that estimated
by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The Cs quantity was too low to be detected
by X-ray techniques; however, a small quantity of this cation (<5%)
might be present in the crystal structure. Concerning the structurally refined s.o.f. value of Br (0.13), an even
more robust determination (s.o.f = 0.10) was independently derived by adopting Vegard’s law, which correlates the refined
lattice parameter and anionic composition of the mixed halide, CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 (for x ≈ 0 and a = 6.3296 Å), with the two end members of the same series (FAPbI3, a = 6.3639 Å, and FAPbBr3, a = 6.0042 Å),69,122 as depicted
in Figure S14. Additionally, using a standard
benchtop energy dispersive XRF instrument and a calibration mixture
of Pb(NO3)2 and KBr in a 5:1 ratio, the Br fraction
in the title compound was calculated to be 0.16(3), corroborating
the presented estimates. In addition, to assess whether the quinary
compositions undergo phase separation into respective ternary compounds,
we report the pattern of a mixture of FAPbBr3 (13% w/w)
and FAPbI3 (87% w/w) cubic phases and compare it to a solid
solution model (Figure S16). The result
indicates the absence of phase segregation. Overall, we highlight
that FA+ cations, fully or nearly fully occupying the A-site
of the 3D perovskite framework, systematically favor the formation
of a cubic structure [FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, and the
herein studied CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3], whereas in CsPbX3 NCs, the smaller Cs ions favor the tilting of octahedra and the
formation of orthorhombic γ-phases, even after incorporation
of up to 10% FA.69

Thermal stability of quinary NCs
and, for comparison, FAPbI3 NCs was evaluated using thermogravimetry
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); see Figure S17. The decomposition of both kinds of NCs occurs
in a few steps. Both show a most pronounced DSC feature at 335 °C
that can be attributed to the decomposition of FA cations, indicating
that both materials are of similar thermal stability.

Light-Emitting
Diodes
CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs were used to construct
LEDs with the device structure depicted in Figure 6a. These LEDs were fabricated by spin coating
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
on prepatterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrates, followed
by the spin coating of poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bisphenylbenzidine (poly-TPD) and an NC emissive
layer. Later, 50 nm of 2,2,2″-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi), 1.2 nm of lithium fluoride (LiF),
and 100 nm of aluminum (Al) were sequentially evaporated on top of
the emissive layer. Two different devices (1 and 2) were tested, with
device 2 containing TOPAS polymer in the NC layer (TOPAS = cyclic
olefin copolymer from TOPAS Advanced Polymers GmbH). LED performance
was characterized by measuring current density and radiance as a function
of the voltage applied between the ITO anode and Al cathode (Figure 6b) and by measuring
the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum (Figure 6d). The current density of device 1 steadily
increased from 8 × 10–4 mA cm–2 at 2 V to over 100 mA cm–2 at 10 V. The radiance
surpassed 10–4 W sr–1 m–2 at just above 3 V and increased up to 3.9 W sr–1 m–2 at 7.5 V. The radiance, current density, and
EL spectrum were then used to calculate the EQE, which describes the
number of out-coupled photons per number of injected electrons. The
EQE dependence on current density is shown in Figure 6c, with a device 1 peak EQE of 5.9% at 0.1
mA cm–2 (0.2% at 100 mA cm–2)
and a device 2 peak EQE of 4.2%. The peak EQE and turn-on voltage
of >3 V are in line with our previous work, in which we investigated
FAPbI3 LEDs emitting at 772 nm.69 However, in the case of LEDs incorporating CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs,
the EQE stays above 2.5% for currents up to 10 mA cm–2. The peak radiance is also higher with quinary NCs (3.9 versus 1.54 W sr–1 m–2).69 While the low efficiency roll-off
below 10 mA cm–2 indicates a good electron–hole
balance in the emission layer124 and excellent
carrier/exciton confinement,125 the turn-on
voltage of over 3 V, ∼1.3 V higher than expected from the band-gap
energy of the CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs (∼1.7 eV), suggests
that further optimization of the device architecture is needed in
order to reduce the charge-injection barrier(s). The EL spectra (Figure 6d) revealed a sharp
peak near 735 nm with a narrowest fwhm of 37 nm at 9 V for device
1 and as low as 27 nm at 8.5 V for device 2. Figures S18 and S19 present the evolution of EL spectra with increasing
the voltage, for both devices. Even though device 1 showed the best
EQE value of 5.9% and peak radiance of 3.9 W sr–1 m–2, device 2 (best EQE of 4.2%) showed a distinctly
different behavior: EL peak narrowing at higher voltages (Figure S19), from an initial fwhm of 40 nm to
27 nm at 8.5 V. In device 2, the fwhm of the EL spectrum is strikingly
narrower than that in the NC PL spectra in the solution (fwhm = 40
nm) and in films (fwhm = 52 nm); see Figure S20 for comparison. Together with the red shift of the EL peak position,
this might indicate an efficient energy transfer between the NCs.126 As a plausible scenario, the applied voltage
might induce anion migration and hence alter the energy band gaps
of NCs within the layer.127 The emission
might then occur through the channeling of excitation into the specific
population of NCs. To the best of our knowledge, the EL fwhm of 27
nm (62 meV) is the narrowest among those reported for the red (and
near-IR) perovskite LEDs. Figure S21 shows
typical transient properties of the NC LED at a constant voltage of
4.5 V. Significant growth of the current density from 0.1 mA cm–2 to over 5 mA cm–2 within seconds
is observed. This might again support the possibility of the ionic
rearrangement within the NC film that improves charge injection, similar
to the light-emitting electrochemical devices.128 The overall LED device lifetime (to reach half of the maximum
EL intensity) at 4.5 V bias is about half a minute. For comparison,
other perovskite LEDs in this wavelength range are those utilizing
methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) thin films treated
with n-butylammonium iodide (EQE of 10.4%),129 quasi-2D perovskites (EQE of 8.8%),126 and multiple quantum wells (EQE of 11.7%).130

Conclusions
Herein, we have described
the combinatorial synthesis of highly luminescent and stable CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs with emission and absorption spectra between 690 and
780 nm. Using a microfluidic platform, we identified the compositional
parametric zones for fine-tuning optical properties, while retaining
emission line widths in the range of 45–65 nm (before isolation,
size selection, and purification). Importantly, microfluidic parameters
can be readily transferred to conventional flask-based synthetic processes
used by the perovskite research community. The PL fwhm can be further
refined to ∼40 nm as a result of the size selection occurring
during the isolation and purification of NCs. Characterization by
synchrotron X-ray scattering indicates a cubic structure for the CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs, wherein solid mixed-anion solutions can be clearly confirmed.
The distribution of Cs ions remains rather controversial, yet its
addition to the reaction mixture is of paramount importance in improving
the long-term stability of NCs. The successful fabrication of NC-based
LED devices with EQEs as high as 5.9% indicates the excellent chemical
durability of CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs. Future studies should
focus on understanding the interesting observations of the slow transient
response of the LEDs and narrow EL spectral line width of 27 at 735
nm.

The synthesis of multinary lead halide perovskite (LHP)
NCs might open opportunities for the broad deployment of these nanomaterials
in photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices. For instance, these
infrared-active NCs are highly desirable for applications in single-junction
or tandem photovoltaics, where NC colloids can be employed as inks
for depositing active absorbing layers.1,17 In this regard,
in contrast to conventional molecular LHP solutions used as inks,
the ease of compositional engineering and facile ligand removal exhibited
by the currently developed quinary NCs, followed by low-temperature
sintering for recrystallization into continuous thin films, suggests
numerous possibilities. Alternatively, or rather orthogonally, methods
of surface coating for maintaining the quantum-size effects may enable
thin-film or quantum-dot-like photovoltaic devices17,131 and photodetectors.132

99.9%), lead bromide (PbBr2, ABCR, 98%), lead iodide (PbI2, ABCR, 99.999%), 1-octadecene (90%), oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,
90%), and oleylamine (Acros, ≥ 96%) were used as the reagents.
Galden PFPE fluid was purchased from Blaser Swisslube AG. Patterned
indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrates were purchased from
Lumtech. The hole injection material PEDOT:PSS was purchased from
Heraeus (CLEVIOS VP AI 4083), while the hole transport material poly-TPD
was procured from Lumtech and the electron transport material TPBi
was supplied by e-Ray Optoelectronics. The electron injection material
LiF was purchased from Acros Organics, and Al pellets were purchased
from Kurt J. Lesker Co. Ltd. TOPAS polymer (cyclic olefin copolymer)
was received from TOPAS Advanced Polymers GmbH. All the materials
for LED production were used as received without any further purification.

Microfluidic Synthesis
Various concentrations of precursor
solutions (see Supporting Information for
details) were used depending on the experimental purpose (sample collection,
absorption measurements, PL measurements). Precision syringe pumps
(neMESYS, Cetoni GmbH, Germany) were used to inject the dispersed
phase (PbX2, FA-oleate, and Cs-oleate precursor solutions)
and the carrier fluid (Galden fluorinated fluid, Blaser Swisslube
AG, Germany) toward a manifold (Manifold Assay 7 Port 10-32 Std, Upchurch
Scientific, Germany) to form a segmented flow of droplets. The injection
manifold and the syringes carrying the precursor solutions were connected
through polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (i.d. 250 μm, o.d. 1/16
in., Upchurch Scientific, Germany) using polyether ether ketone finger-tight
fittings (F-127, Upchurch Scientific, Germany). The carrier fluid
was transferred to the manifold via fluorinated ethylene
propylene tubing (i.d. 750 μm, o.d. 1/16 in., Upchurch Scientific,
Germany). Typical flow rates were between 80 and 100 μL min–1 for the carrier phase and between 0.1 and 50 μL
min–1 for the precursors. The chemical payload of
the formed droplets can be tuned in a precise and rapid fashion by
continuously varying the precursor volumetric flow rates. The formed
droplets containing the reaction mixture were subsequently directed
through perfluoroether tubing (i.d. 500 μm, o.d. 1/16 in., Upchurch
Scientific, Germany) coiled around a copper heating rod (diameter
= 1.5 cm) to allow initiation of the NC-forming reaction and online
detection of the formed perovskite NCs. The overall reaction time
was kept constant in all experiments by ensuring a constant tubing
length between the point where the tubing enters the heating rod and
the detection volume.

Online Photoluminescence Measurements
A 375 nm LED (M375L3-Mounted LED, Thorlabs, Germany) was used as
an excitation source for PL measurements. The collimated beam was
directed toward a dichroic beam splitter (Multiphoton LP-Strahlenteiler
HC 375 LP, AHF, Germany) and then focused into the microfluidic channel
using an aspheric lens (A240TM, f = 8.0 mm, NA 0.50, Thorlabs, Germany).
Emission originating from the microfluidic channel was collected by
the same lens, passed through the dichroic beam splitter, and coupled via a 10× objective (RMS10X, NA 0.25, Thorlabs, Germany)
to a fiber spectrometer (QE 65000, Ocean Optics, UK) via a 2 m long multimode fiber with a core diameter of 400 μm
(QP400-2-UV–vis, Ocean Optics, UK). The spectrometer incorporated
a 20 μm entrance slit, a 600 lines/mm grating, and a 2048-pixel
detector. The spectrometer was operated between 350 and 1100 nm, and
data were recorded using an integration time between 50 and 100 ms.

Online Absorbance Measurements
Absorbance measurements were
conducted after the heating stage, where the reaction mixture flows
through a high-purity perfluoralkoxy capillary (1/16 in. o.d., 500
μm i.d., IDEX Health & Science, USA). The in-line absorbance
spectrometer consists of a fiber-coupled halogen lamp (HL-2000 HP,
Ocean Optics, UK) and a fiber-coupled spectrometer (AvaSpec ULS2048
Starline, Avantes, USA). The spectrometer was operated between 200
and 1100 nm, and data were recorded using an integration time of 100
ms.

Flask Synthesis: Preparation of Formamidinium Oleate Stock
Solution
Formamidinium acetate (3.765 mmol, 0.392 g, Aldrich,
99%) was loaded into a 50 mL three-neck flask along with ODE (18 mL)
and OA (12 mL). The reaction mixture was degassed three times at room
temperature, heated to 100 °C in a nitrogen environment, maintained
at that temperature until the reaction is complete, and then cooled
to room temperature. The resulting solution was stored in a glovebox.

Flask Synthesis: Preparation of a Cesium Oleate Stock Solution
Cesium carbonate (0.015 mmol, 5 mg) was loaded into a 25 mL three-neck
flask along with ODE (10 mL) and OA (0.625 mL). The reaction mixture
was degassed three times at room temperature, heated to 120 °C
in a nitrogen atmosphere, maintained at that temperature until the
reaction was complete, and cooled to room temperature. The resulting
solution was stored in a glovebox.

Flask Synthesis of Cs0.01FA0.99Pb(Br0.11I0.89)3 NCs
In a 25 mL three-necked flask, PbI2 (55 mg, 0.12 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) and PbBr2 (5 mg, 0.014
mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) were suspended in ODE (4.6 mL), heated to 60
°C, and then dried under vacuum for 30 min. Subsequently, the
reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere,
followed by the addition of dried solvents: OLA (0.5 mL, Strem) and
OA (1.0 mL, Aldrich). Once PbI2 was dissolved, the reaction
mixture was cooled to 80 °C. At this point, a mixture of the
formamidinium oleate (4.8 mL) and cesium oleate (1.2 mL) stock solutions
was injected into the reaction flask. After another 15 s, the reaction
mixture was cooled using a water-ice bath. The crude solution was
centrifuged at 12 100 rpm for 7 min, and the supernatant discarded.
The precipitate was dissolved in hexane (250 μL), and the resulting
solution was centrifuged again at 10 000 rpm for 3 min. The
supernatant and precipitate were separated, and 150 μL of hexane
was added to the supernatant. This fraction was labeled as “SN”.
The precipitate was dissolved in toluene (1.0 mL) and centrifuged
at 3500 rpm for 2 min to get rid of large NCs, with the resultant
sample being labeled as “P”. Particles from both fractions
were washed again to remove excess organic ligands.

Washing of
Cs0.01FA0.99Pb(Br0.11I0.89)3 SN NCs
To 100 μL of a hexane solution
of NCs were added hexane (100 μL), toluene (200 μL), and
methyl acetate (530 μL). The solution was centrifuged at 13 400
rpm for 3 min and redissolved in hexane or toluene (PL at ∼730
nm).

Washing of Cs0.01FA0.99Pb(Br0.11I0.89)3 P NCs
Methyl acetate (0.65
mL) was added to a toluene solution of fraction “P”
and centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 rpm. The obtained precipitate
was dissolved in toluene, hexane, or octane (PL at ∼750 nm).

Offline Characterization
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorbance spectra were recorded using a Jasco V770 spectrometer in
transmission mode. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a
Fluoromax iHR 320 Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorimeter equipped with
a PMT detector. The excitation wavelength was 400 nm, and the excitation
source was a 450 W xenon lamp. The measured intensities were corrected
to account for the spectral response of the detector. Powder XRD patterns
were recorded using a powder diffractometer (STOE STADI P) with Cu
Kα1 radiation. The diffractometer was operated in transmission
mode with a germanium monochromator and a silicon strip detector (Dectris
Mythen). TEM images were captured using a JEOL JEM-2200FS microscope
operated at 200 kV. Quantitative XRF measurements were conducted using
a benchtop Minipal 2 PANalytical spectrometer with polycarbonate films
supporting dry colloids or powders and a Cr X-ray tube operating at
a maximum power of 30 W. Thermal analysis (thermogravimetry and differential
scanning calorimetry) was performed using a Netzsch Simultaneous thermal
analyzer (STA 449 F5 Jupiter). A powdered sample (6–10 mg)
was placed in an alumina crucible and heated under Ar gas flow (50
mL/min) to 800 °C (10 °C/min). NC solutions in hexane were
predried in small alumina beakers at room temperature.

Quantum Yield
Measurements
To measure the relative PL quantum yield of
the NC solution, dilute solutions of NCs in toluene and dye standards
(Rhodamine 6G in ethanol and zinc phthalocyanine in benzene) were
prepared in 10 mm optical path length cuvettes, ensuring an absorbance
of approximately 0.1 at either 488 or 633 nm. PL quantum yields were
calculated according to  where Φif and Φsf are the PL QYs of the sample and standard, respectively; Fi and Fs are the integrated areas of the sample and
standard spectra, respectively; fi and fs are the
absorption factors of the sample and standard (f =
1–10–A, where A is the absorbance),
respectively; ni and ns are the refractive indices
of the sample and standard, respectively.133

Absolute quantum yield measurements of the films and NC solutions
were performed using a Hamamatsu Quantaurus QY spectrometer (C11347-11)
equipped with an integrating sphere. The excitation peak wavelength
was 450 nm.

Fabrication of LED Devices
Initially,
ITO substrates were rinsed with a mixture of deionized water and detergent
solution. Subsequently, substrates were sonicated for 20 min in acetone
and isopropyl alcohol. To enhance wettability, substrates were treated
with an oxygen plasma for 10 min. An aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS
was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, after which the ITO substrates
were annealed on a hot plate under ambient conditions for 30 min at
130 °C. Subsequently, they were transferred into a nitrogen-filled
glovebox for the deposition of subsequent layers. Poly-TPD was spin
coated at 1000 rpm from a 2 mg/mL chlorobenzene solution and annealed
for 20 min at 120 °C. For device 1 a colloidal suspension of
CsxFA1–xPb(Br1–yIy)3 NCs in hexane (7 mg/mL) was spin coated at 2000
rpm; for device 2 the NC solution was mixed with TOPAS polymer (0.5
mg/mL) and spin coated at 2000 rpm. Subsequently, the substrates were
transferred into a vacuum chamber at 10–7 mbar,
where 50 nm of TPBi (electron transport layer), 1.2 nm of LiF, and
100 nm of Al (cathode) were evaporated through a shadow mask at evaporation
rates of 0.5, 0.1, and 2 A/s, respectively. An active pixel area of
16 mm2 was determined by the overlap of ITO and Al. All
devices were measured under ambient conditions without encapsulation.

LED Performance Characterization
The J–V–L characteristics of the fabricated
LEDs were measured under ambient conditions using a Keysight 2902b
source measurement unit and a calibrated photodiode (FDS1010-CAL,
Thorlabs). The size of the photodiode (10 × 10 mm2) is much larger than that of the active pixel size (4 × 4 mm2) of the LEDs. The EQEs of the fabricated LEDs were calculated
from the known EL spectra of the LEDs and photodiode sensitivity,134 while the radiance was calculated assuming
a Lambertian emission profile. EL spectra were recorded using a CCS200
CCD spectrometer (Thorlabs) and a PR-655 (Photoresearch) spectroradiometer.
LED transient optoelectronic properties were measured with a Keysight
2902b source measurement unit and amplified photodiode (PDA36A-EC,
Thorlabs) with 20 μs resolution.

Synchrotron X-ray Total
Scattering Measurements
The experimental synchrotron X-ray
total scattering data of colloidal CsxFA1–x(Br1-yIy)3 NCs (FA
= [HC(NH2)2]+) NCs in octane were
collected at the X04SA-MS4 Powder Diffraction Beamline of the Swiss
Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, CH) using a certified
quartz capillary (0.5 mm in diameter). The operational beam energy
was set to 22 keV (λ = 0.563 729 Å) and accurately
determined using a silicon powder standard (NIST 640d, a0 = 0.543 123(8) nm at 22.5 °C). Data were
collected in the 0.5–130° 2θ range using a single-photon-counting
silicon microstrip detector (MYTHEN II). Total scattering patterns
with air background, empty glass capillary, and pure solvent were
independently collected under the same experimental conditions and
properly subtracted from the sample signal. Transmission coefficients
of the sample- and solvent-loaded capillaries were also measured and
used for angle-dependent absorption correction. Inelastic Compton
scattering was added as an additional model component during data
analysis. For DSE-based modeling, an angular range of 3–120°
was used.

Temperature-dependent measurements were also performed
in the range of 98–348 K using a temperature-controlled N2 stream fluxing over the capillary. No phase transitions were
observed in the explored temperature range.
