Molecular
self-assembly due to chemical interactions is the basis
of bottom-up nanofabrication, whereas weaker intermolecular forces
dominate on the scale of macromolecules. Recent advances in synthesis
and characterization have brought increasing attention to two- and
mixed-dimensional heterostructures, and it has been recognized that
van der Waals (vdW) forces within the structure may have a significant
impact on their morphology. Here, we suspend single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs) on graphene to create a model system for the study
of a 1D–2D molecular interface through atomic-resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy observations. When brought into contact,
the radial deformation of SWCNTs and the emergence of long-range linear
grooves in graphene revealed by the three-dimensional reconstruction
of the heterostructure are observed. These topographic features are
strain-correlated but show no sensitivity to carbon nanotube helicity,
electronic structure, or stacking order. Finally, despite the random
deposition of the nanotubes, we show that the competition between
strain and vdW forces results in aligned carbon–carbon interfaces
spanning hundreds of nanometers.

==== Body
Building on enormous advances
in graphene research, interest has recently shifted to the creation
of so-called van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). These typically
combine graphene and other two-1 or lower-dimensional2,3 molecules into vertical stacks. The principal idea of this concept
is to preserve the covalent bonding structure of the molecules that
interact with each other mainly through van der Waals (vdW) forces
while the electronic and plasmonic coupling between the layers remains
relatively strong and enables the creation of functional (meta)materials.1,3−7 However, regardless of the nominally weak vdW interaction, the lattice
mismatches in these structures can result in significant morphological
changes.8,9

The creation of exclusively 2D heterostructures
has proven relatively
straightforward, either by directly placing two sheets into contact1 or via epitaxial growth.10−14 Furthermore, the energetic tendency to maximize the
contact area seems to drive self-cleaning within the vdW gap,15 enabling atomically pure interfaces. However,
it is much more challenging to obtain sufficiently clean, ordered,
and thin layers of lower-dimensional structures owing to their higher
chemical reactivity. This in turn has hindered the efforts to experimentally
study fundamental phenomena governing the interactions between the
layers. We recently studied monolayers of C60 molecules
trapped in between two graphene sheets16 in a higher-dimensional analogue of carbon pea pods.17 In this mixed-dimensional heterostructure, we
observed the deformation of the graphene sheets only at the edges
of C60 molecular layers.

Here, to create a 1D–2D
molecular interface, we have dry-deposited
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on suspended monolayer graphene.
Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we study how
they stack onto graphene and how the adsorbtion changes the morphology
of both materials. Unlike most other molecules of this class, SWCNTs
are hollow tubes that may deform when interacting with substrates,18−20 and although their covalent structure remains intact, this is expected
to affect their transport properties.21 Likewise, the relative orientation strongly influences their electronic
coupling: in earlier experiments, the contact barriers between graphite
and carbon nanotubes were modulated by an order of magnitude simply
by changing the orientation.22

Through
three-dimensional reconstructions of the interfaces, we
find that graphene partially folds around the suspended molecules.
The interplay between vdW and elastic energies allows them to maximize
the contact area and thus minimize the total energy of the system.
Much like a canvas strained by a mass that it supports, the graphene
membrane also becomes slightly strained. This tension dampens the
mechanical vibrations of clean suspended areas, allowing the vdWHs
to be imaged at resolutions higher than separately possible for either
material as cleanly as here. Unlike their vacuum-suspended counterparts,
individual atoms of the tubes embedded in heterostructures can be
resolved not just near the suspension point23 but also over their entire length. Complementary to scanning probe
techniques,24,25 this approach may prove useful
for the direct identification of point defects at ambient temperature.

Finally, we find that the carbon nanotubes align on the surface
according to the symmetry of graphene, presumably to optimize the
stacking of their lower wall with the underlying lattice. Nanotubes
have been previously observed to grow epitaxially on graphite step
edges,26 but here they self-order on ultraclean
graphene due to thermal excitation.

Results and Discussion
The heterostructures were fabricated as in Figure 1a, starting with the synthesis of carbon
nanotubes by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD)27,28 followed by direct deposition29 onto
monolayer graphene and cleaning by laser irradiation in vacuum.30 The cleaning procedure exposed large atomically
pure areas of up to 1 μm2 in size for atomic-resolution
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis, as shown
by the medium-angle annular dark field (MAADF) image in Figure 1c magnifying a small part of
what was imaged in bright-field mode in Figure 1b. Within the example field of view, we find
several SWCNTs in direct contact with graphene over hundreds of nanometers,
as evidenced by their common focus. (To appear sharp, atoms need to
lie within the depth of field of our STEM system, approximately 2–3
nm, and at these distances, the molecules are brought together by
vdW forces.) Unlike noncleaned samples (Supporting Information Section 1), these structures are devoid of contamination,
hindering the view during STEM observations, and their atomic structure
can be directly determined. The interfaces assume either well-aligned
or meandering configurations, both visible in our examples. In the
following analysis, however, we restrict ourselves to the aligned
segments that exhibit the highest possible periodicity and thus structural
unambiguity.

i.e., |θarmchair – θchiral| = 0°. (j) Histogram of observed stacking angles for 24 distinct
interfaces, with 30° representing turbostratic and 0° representing

The structure of a SWCNT
is completely described by its chiral
indices (n, m). Together with the
graphene basis vectors, these span chiral vector Ch.31 Any tube can thus be constructed
by wrapping a sheet of graphene around a cylinder at a chiral angle
θchiral and connecting the perimeters. The chiral
indices of a nanotube can be directly determined from its electron
diffraction pattern,32 an atomically resolved
real-space image,33 or its Fourier transform
(FT). Here we exclusively use the latter approach, acquiring atomically
resolved images such as those shown in Figure 1d,e,g,i. When SWCNTs are deposited on graphene,
the contrast of the lattices is intermixed and structural identification
requires working in Fourier space. For example, the FT of the heterostructure
of Figure 1d is presented
in Figure 1f, showing
distinct contributions from both materials. The layer lines L1···n and the
equatorial line L0 arise from the lattice
of the nanotube, and the graphene reflections arise from the atoms
in the background. The intensity oscillations along L1···n and their spacing d1···n are mathematically
related to the structure of the tube, with each line being described
by a single Bessel function.34 Given that
SWCNTs may compress radially on the surface and thus have an ill-defined
diameter,18 the best structural unambiguity
is achieved by separately analyzing the layer line spacing35 and the oscillations along the lines36 and comparing the experiments to STEM simulations.37 For example, the best structural match for the
tube in Figure 1d,e
is (20, 2) having a chiral angle of 4.7° and nominal diameter DN of 16.51 Å. The methods
for structural determination are discussed in Supporting Information Section 2.

Following this procedure,
we can acquire the structure of any suspended
SWCNT imaged with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio. For example,
the tube in Figure 1g is (19, 1) and thus has a slightly smaller diameter of 15.28 Å,
as also readily visible from the real-space image. A particularly
interesting case of a (6, 6) armchair tube with an extremely small
diameter of just 8.18 Å appearing to be perfectly aligned with
the supporting graphene lattice is presented in Figure 1h,i. Since FT represents the frequency components
of a real-space image in all directions, it also encodes the orientation
of any periodic structure. Hence, we can find the relative orientation
of graphene and SWCNT hexagons (although we cannot know which frequency
components arise from the bottom and which arise from the top layer)
by determining angles θarmchair and θchiral in Fourier space (Figure 1f). For example, the (20, 2) tube has a helicity of 4.7°
(i.e., the armchair edge is rotated by this amount with respect to
the tube axis), and from the FT, we see that θarmchair (angle between the tube axis and the nearest graphene armchair edge)
is exactly 30°. This gives us a misalignment angle of 25.3°
for the (20, 2) tube and 0° for the (6, 6) tube.

We systematically
analyzed 24 heterostructures for which the related
angles could be reliably determined. The distribution of these angles
is shown in Figure 1j. Interestingly, we observe a nonuniform distribution favoring the
aligned configuration, implying that the SWCNTs are not randomly oriented
despite having landed on the substrate randomly.29

We suspect that this alignment is not spontaneous
but is enabled
by the laser treatment, simultaneously providing the required thermal
energy while removing the contamination that would hinder the movement.
Approximately 55% of the heterostructures remain disordered, which
could result from residual contamination stuck in the nanotube junctions,
such as those presented in Figure 1c. The nanotubes appear to reach a (constrained) energy
minimum within the potential landscape of graphene and hence preserve
their orientation over relatively long distances. Interestingly, the
aligned structures not only have the highest possible symmetry but
also allow the nanotube handedness to be directly extracted based
on the graphene orientation.26

We
now turn our attention to the detailed response of the heterostructure
to dispersion forces, first concentrating on the nanotubes. After
seminal molecular mechanics predictions in the early 1990s,20 the radial deformation of SWCNTs as influenced
by substrates has also been studied experimentally.18,19 Most investigations, however, have been limited to scanning probe
methods,18,38,39 posing problems
with tip deconvolution, the vdW distance to the substrate, and surface
roughness.38 Moreover, a structural determination
using these techniques is extremely demanding.25 In contrast, our heterostructures provide the first clean
view to measure such effects using an electron probe free of these
confounding factors. Furthermore, the image scale can be directly
calibrated in Fourier space by using the nearest-neighbor distance
in graphene and finally the apparent diameter (DA) measured at sub-angstrom accuracy.

The eccentricity
(ϵ) of a deformed tubular object can be
described as the ratio of the major and minor axes of the ellipse
it forms. Here we use a slightly different definition, ϵ = DA/DN, i.e., comparing
the apparent and nominal diameters directly. For this comparison,
we have chosen three tubes (13, 3), (12, 12), and (30, 5) with nominal
diameters of 10.79, 16.29, and 25.67 Å, respectively, as shown
in Figure 2a,d,e. To
determine their eccentricity, we analyzed the wall separation by fitting
Gaussian line shapes to the nanotube cross-sectional intensity profiles
shown below the real-space images. For example, the small-diameter
(13, 3) tube is quite rigid, undergoing only a small deformation to
ϵ = 1.022. The slightly larger (12, 12) tube flattens more to
an eccentricity of 1.033, and the (30, 5) tube flattens to as high
as 1.114. In total, we studied the deformation of 10 structurally
identified tubes, with the results gathered in Figure 2f. Neither the chiral angle nor the electronic
type (semiconductor or metal) appear to be correlated with the amount
of deformation, which confirms earlier theoretical predictions.40 Generally speaking, however, and especially
considering the accuracy of our method, the data shows a large variation
in ϵ. Surprisingly, deformation on graphene seems to be greater
than what is separately reported for bundled SWCNTs19 or on bulk substrates.18

eccentricity (ϵ = DA/DN) of SWCNTs suspended on graphene. The coloring of the
tabulated (n, m) values encodes
semiconducting (orange), metallic (black), and semimetallic (blue)
carbon nanotube species. Each image scale bar in (a) and (d–e)
has a length of 0.4 nm. To enhance the image contrast in (a, b) and
(d, e), ImageJ lookup table “Fire” was applied.

To understand these discrepancies,
we used atomistic simulations
(Methods) to study the adsorption of SWCNTs
on both graphene and graphite. Graphite was imitated by completely
fixing a single layer of graphene, whereas to reproduce the curvature
of graphene found in experiments (discussed next), the simulation
cell perpendicular to tube axis was initially compressed by 0.7–0.8%,
leaving the graphene under a negative strain and thus free to adapt
to the adsorbed tube. Simulations were performed on (i) (13, 3) and
(30, 5) tubes suspended on graphene and marked with star symbols in Figure 2f and (ii) for a
number of armchair tubes suspended on graphite, as indicated by the
dashed line.

Interestingly, tubes on graphene show larger deformations
than
on graphite, ϵ = 1.038 vs 1.009 for (13, 3) and 1.110 vs 1.090
for (30, 5). This initially counterintuitive result is explained by
an increase in binding energy on graphene, in respective order yielding
0.085 vs 0.176 eV/Å and 0.205 vs 0.411 eV/Å. This is a direct
consequence of graphene minimizing the surface energy by partially
folding around the nanotube as in Figure 3e–g and Supporting Information Figure S5. Thus, the gain in surface energy is
achieved by the greater structural deformation of the tube.

5) tube and (g) the fitted simulation. The experimental points in
(e) and (g) are average atom positions perpendicular to the tube axis.

The observed variation in ϵ
can be similarly explained: randomly
oriented tubes on isotropically strained graphene undergo minimum
deformation, but a uniaxial strain allows graphene to bend perpendicular
to this axis, with some of the tubes deviating from the curve.

Apparently, the real-world membrane behaves like this, with the
strain continuously varying in both direction and magnitude at different
locations on the sample.

We turn our attention next to graphene,
which ideally is a perfectly
two-dimensional crystal. We start by analyzing the interatomic spacing
of the graphene lattice around the carbon nanotubes. In normal projection,
a planar topology has isotropic atomic separations quantized to 60°
angles. This, however, systematically changes on a curved surface,
as schematically depicted in the lower part of Figure 2c. Here, we chose the lattice near the (30,
5) tube and used Fourier filtering to produce a clearer view of the
atom positions, shown in Figure 2b. From the filtered image, we extracted the interatom
separations by fitting Gaussian line shapes to the intensity profiles
of each atom, highlighted by the green circles, producing the data
shown in Figure 2c.
If we schematically approach the interface from the right-hand side,
then we observe a decrease in the apparent atom separation, extending
∼20 Å from the edge and thus implying local out-of-plane
curvature. By this method alone, however, the vertical direction of
the inclination is ambiguous.

This limitation can be overcome
by analyzing atomic-resolution
images of the sample recorded from the same area under different tilt
angles. We have recently developed an algorithm that obtains the 3D
structure of a 2D material (graphene) from a minimum of two projections
with a relative sample tilt of about 15–20°.41 The algorithm identifies the position of each
atom within the experimental projections and then finds the best-matching
3D structure that minimizes the difference between simulated images
of the structure and the available experimental ones. Figure 3b,c shows projections of the
(13, 3) tube on graphene acquired by rotating the sample separately
around the x and y axes by 300 mrad
(17.2°) relative to the normal incidence in Figure 3a. Since only the structure
of the single-layer graphene can be unambiguously reconstructed, the
atom positions between the red dashed lines were omitted from the
analysis, finally yielding the 3D atomic model shown in Figure 3d. To recover the complete
structure including the nanotube, we performed several atomistic simulations
with a varying degree of strain in the graphene to simultaneously
match the result to experimental graphene curvature and SWCNT eccentricity
(Methods). As readily visible in Figure 3e, the simulation
reveals an ∼14-Å-deep 1D groove symmetrically expanding
on both sides of the tube. The experimental points here represent
the average vertical positions of atoms perpendicular to the tube
axis. Following the same procedure, we also studied the graphene curvature
around the (30, 5) tube, for which the reconstructed lattice and simulation
are shown in Figure 3f,g, respectively.

Finally, given the high adsorption energies
and the strain in graphene,
these hybrid structures are extremely stable in our STEM experiments.
Images can be acquired from arbitrary positions at resolution exceptional
for such large and atomically clean systems. Furthermore, graphene
can be effectively eliminated from the data by Fourier filtering.16 This reveals a beautiful view of the SWCNT lattice
from which the positions of individual atoms can be resolved along
the tube axis. Such an example is shown in Figure 4a,b, displaying a (24, 2) tube with and without
the graphene background. These images are extremely sharp, exhibiting
a striking resemblance to the image simulations in Figure 4c,d.

Conclusions
By using graphene and
single-walled carbon nanotubes as a model
heterostructure, we have studied atomic-scale deformations in a 1D–2D
molecular interface held together by van der Waals forces. The interface
shows topographically interesting features, with nanotubes dipping
into the supporting graphene layer, creating ordered, long-range,
one-dimensional grooves that reduce the surface energy of the structure.
With the help of multiple projections, the three-dimensional structure
of the lattice can be reconstructed, and when correlated with atomistic
simulations, the morphology of the complete heterostructure is recovered.
The graphene support thus allows the nanotubes to be observed along
their entire length at room temperature with accuracy previously possible
only through scanning probe techniques on rigid substrates.

Methods
Sample Fabrication
Carbon nanotubes were synthesized
using floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition. For small-diameter
tubes, we used carbon monoxide as the carbon precursor, decomposing
on ex-situ-generated iron nanoparticles at 880 °C.27 The larger-diameter tubes were synthesized at
1050 °C by ethylene precursor decomposing on nanoparticles formed in situ from ferrocene vapor.28 The as-synthesized tubes were dry-deposited29 on commercial CVD graphene (Graphenea Inc.) suspended on perforated
silicon nitride grids (Ted Pella Inc.) The structures were cleaned
by 20 s of laser irradiation at 3 W excitation power30 under 10–7 Pa pressure and transferred
to the microscope column within the same vacuum system.

Scanning Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Atomic-resolution
imaging used the aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM 100 operated
with a 60 keV primary beam energy, with the sample in a near-ultrahigh
vacuum of 2 × 10–7 Pa. The angular range for
the medium-angle annular dark-field (MAADF) detector was 60–200
mrad. Sample tilt was eliminated by bringing a 64 × 64 nm field
of view completely into focus by rotating the sample in a standard
Nion double-tilt holder. With our 2 to 3 nm depth of field, this corresponds
to a maximum tilt of less than 5°, providing good unambiguity
in the (n ,m) assignment.37 To minimize spatial inaccuracies caused by scan
distortions (i.e., variations in the vertical scan speed) or drift,
the nanotube diameters were measured from images acquired by setting
the scan direction perpendicular to the carbon nanotube axis. For
reliable (n, m) assignment, both
parallel and perpendicular scans were used and compared.

Scanning Transmission
Electron Microscopy Simulations
STEM simulations were performed
using QSTEM 2.31 with a chromatic
aberration coefficient of 1 mm, a spherical aberration coefficient
of 1 μm, an energy spread of 0.48 eV, and MAADF detector angles
set to the experimental range of 60–200 mrad. The illumination
semiangle was 35 mrad. In Figure 4c,d, the best match with the experiment was achieved
by placing the carbon nanotube at a van der Waals distance (0.34 nm)
from the graphene membrane (without energy optimization) and rotating
the whole system by 5° around the principal axis perpendicular
to the tube, with the electron beam then encountering the sample plane
at this angle. The chiral index, (24, 2), and the relative graphene
orientation in the simulation were identified from the experimental
image as described in the text and in Supporting Information Section 2. To mimic the experimental contrast in Figure 4d, graphene was first
included in the simulations and manually removed by Fourier filtering.

Three-Dimensional Reconstruction
The three-dimensional
reconstruction was done by matching a simulated model to a series
of experimental images acquired from different tilt angles by rotating
the sample to ±300 mrad inclination during imaging. Finally,
the structure was obtained through an optimization process where both
the atomic positions and the simulated imaging parameters were iteratively
changed until the best possible match to the experiment was found.41 This was possible since the location of each
graphene lattice atom and their connections to nearest neighbors could
be discerned from each projection.

Atomistic Simulations
The adaptive intermolecular reactive
empirical bond order (AIREBO)43 potential
was used to describe the covalent bonding in graphene and nanotubes,
whereas vdW interactions were included by augmenting the model with
a Morse potential.44 The torsion component
of the AIREBO potential for the nanotube was turned off since this
gave a better match with the experimental results, and the Morse potential
parameters were identical to the AIREBO Morse potential.44 All structural minimization processes were performed
using the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator
(LAMMPS) code.45,46

For each carbon nanotube,
the graphene structure was oriented so that it is commensurate with
a single unit cell of the chiral nanotubes, which is necessary to
enforce the periodic boundary conditions along the axis. For the (13,
3) and (30, 5) tubes, the rotated graphene unit cell was multiplied
perpendicular to the axis by 12- and 28-fold, respectively. Hence,
the total width of graphene for the (13, 3) tube was ∼64 nm,
and that for the (30, 5) tube was ∼66 nm. To match the graphene
curvature with the reconstructed results, the bounding box of the
cell was shrunk by 0.7 and 0.8% for the (13, 3) and (30, 5) tubes,
respectively. The nanotube eccentricity was determined by comparing
the diameters of a relaxed nanotube in vacuum and on the surface.
