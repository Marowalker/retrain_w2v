MXenes
are a new rapidly developing class of two-dimensional materials
with suitable properties for a broad range of applications. It has
been shown that during synthesis of these materials the surfaces are
usually functionalized by O, OH, and F and further suggested that
controlling the surface allows controlling the material properties.
However, a proper understanding of the surface structure is still
missing, with a significant discrepancy between computational and
experimental studies. Experiments consistently show formation of surfaces
with mixed terminations, whereas computational studies point toward
pure terminated surfaces. Here, we explain the formation of mixed
functionalization on the surface of titanium-based two-dimensional
carbides, Ti2C and Ti3C2, using a
multiscale modeling scheme. Our scheme is based on calculating Gibbs
free energy of formation by a combination of electronic structure
calculations with cluster expansion and Monte Carlo simulations. Our
calculations show formation of mixtures of O, OH, and F on the surface
with the composition depending on pH, temperature, and the work function.
On the other hand, our results also suggest a limited stable range
of compositions, which challenges the paradigm of a high tunability
of MXene properties.

==== Body
Two-dimensional
materials, such
as graphene, molybdenum disulfide, and black phosphorus have been
investigated intensely in recent years,1,2 and related
research efforts are moving to real applications. These materials
are commonly prepared either by mechanical or chemical exfoliation
or by deposition techniques.3 A completely
new class of 2D materials, called MXenes, consisting of early transition
metals such as Ti, Sc, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo (denoted as M), and
carbon or nitrogen (denoted as X), has recently been drawing attention.4 2D MXenes provide suitable electronic, optical,
and mechanical properties for a wide range of applications such as
supercapacitors, battery electrodes, transparent conductive coatings,
electromagnetic interference shielding, and optoelectronics.5−8 MXenes are synthesized through etching of layered bulk phases, known
as MAX phases, where transition metal carbide layers are connected
by metal atoms, such as Al.9 In the case
of Ti3C2Al, selective etching with HF removes
aluminum atoms by formation of AlF3, and further sonication
delaminates layers into Ti3C2Tx flakes. During the synthesis, the surface
adsorbs functional groups T = (OH, O, F), which play a crucial role
on the overall MXene properties. Such tunability is a key difference
between MXenes and the other 2D materials, especially as it opens
a possibility to engineer the material properties via surface functionalization. Computationally, it has been shown that
it should be possible to modify electrical and optical properties
by a variation of surface termination, but this has been found to
be challenging to achieve in experiments.

In the experimental
reports, there are large variations in the
obtained composition and distribution of functional groups even when
the preparation is carried out under similar conditions.10−16 This seems to stem from two factors: (i) the details of the functionalization
mechanism and how it depends on the preparation conditions remain
unclear, and (ii) it is difficult to obtain reliably quantitative
information as the surface contains light elements, such as H and
F, and is possibly in contact with a solution. Thus far, several experiments,
such as the energy-loss microscopy,17,18 thermogravimetric
analysis,12 neutron scattering,19 and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(NMR),20 have been conducted. NMR spectroscopy
of Ti3C2 showed a mixing of O, F, and OH without
any segregation in separate regions.20 It
has also been shown that the composition depends on concentration
and type of etchants: O functionalization dominates when Ti3C2 is etched using a mixture of LiF and HCl,20,21 and F functionalization dominates when using HF.20

First-principles calculations could provide the much-needed
insight
into the functionalization mechanism, but the results are still far
from conclusive. This is a challenging problem as it requires an accurate
description of the interactions between the MXene sheet, the functional
groups, and the solution and a proper thermodynamic averaging in the
case of mixtures. Almost all of the previous formation energy calculations
have been carried out for pure terminations and yielded a strong preference
for O-termination.22−28 In order to model a mixture of terminations, MD simulations were
carried out with an explicit solvent and found to yield predominantly
F- and OH-terminations,10 with the exact
composition depending on the HF concentration. In addition, global
structure optimization methods were employed to find the ground-state
structure, in which case the comparison of formation energies showed
predominantly O-terminations and no preference for mixing.27 Only the studies focusing on hydrogenation29,30 of O-terminated surfaces seem to suggest that the coverage can be
tuned by pH or the electrode potential. Clearly, the surface structure
inferred from the calculations is at odds with the experimental data
showing a mixture of all three types of terminations. The origin of
this discrepancy is still unclear but can arise from ignoring the
role of the solvent,31 an improper treatment
of the chemical potential of elements,32 and absence of thermodynamic sampling.33 Thus, the important questions still remain: how functional groups
are distributed and how the composition depends on the experimental
conditions.

Here, we develop a computational scheme to find
the composition
and distribution of O, OH, and F functional groups on the Ti2C and Ti3C2 monolayers at given experimental
conditions. Our multiscale scheme is based on three steps. First,
we adopt the cluster expansion (CE) method together with the density
functional theory (DFT) to efficiently evaluate the energies of functional
group configurations. Second, the CE model together with Monte Carlo
simulations enables us to access the configurational free energies
and to obtain distributions of the functional groups on the surface.
Finally, we calculate the Gibbs free energy of formation in solution
over the whole composition range, carefully accounting for the role
of experimental factors, such as temperature, pH, and the work function.
We also evaluate selected material properties and discuss the degree
of tunability over the accessible range of compositions.

Computational Approach
Surface functionalization
is a complex process involving different time scales and levels of
physics. A proper consideration of surface interaction with adsorbants
and solution is needed as the functionalization process happens in
an etchant solution. On the other hand, a thermodynamically driven
statistical averaging needs to be carried out in the case of mixed
terminations. The need of a proper sampling of the configuration space
leads us to combine electronic structure calculations and concepts
of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.

In order to compare
the stabilities of MXene sheets with different surface terminations,
we determine their Gibbs free energies of formation, which is obtained
by finding the Gibbs free energies for all of the constituents. Here,
we define it for the terminated MXT sheet with respect to the bare,
unterminated MX sheet as 1  where ni is the number of termination atoms of type i and
μ̃i is their
chemical potentials.34G is the “total” Gibbs free energy of the system including
configurational and vibrational contributions and the interaction
with the solvent. All three contributions are important. They are
evaluated here separately and added to the total energies calculated
with DFT. The “°” refers to the standard conditions:
room temperature and in solution with pressure p =
1 atm. The chemical potentials for adsorbed species at these conditions
are determined by combining DFT total energies and experimentally
determined changes in enthalpy and entropy, as described in detail
in Methods.

In order to access the configurational
free energies of MXenes
with mixed terminations, we construct a lattice-gas Hamiltonian, which
is then used in Monte Carlo simulations. For the lattice-gas Hamiltonian,
we use the CE defined by a series of interactions between atoms at
different lattice sites and multiplied by constant expansion coefficients
(effective cluster interactions, ECI). The ECIs in the cluster expansion
are usually obtained via fitting the CE energies
to those calculated by DFT for a set of configurations. Here, we generate
CE for the three-component (O, OH, F) mixture by fitting to a set
of 71 and 106 DFT energies for Ti2C and Ti3C2, respectively. After evaluating different expansions, we
choose for Ti3C2 a CE including pair clusters
up to the fourth nearest neighbors and triplet clusters up to the
first nearest neighbors, which corresponds to a total of 13 pair clusters
and 4 triplet clusters after accounting for the symmetry of the lattice
and the dimension of the configuration space in a three-component
alloy. The pair clusters up to fourth nearest neighbor were sufficient
in the case of Ti2C. These choices yielded small cross-validation
scores of 0.008 and 0.005 eV/atom for Ti3C2 and
Ti2C, respectively. Used clusters are illustrated in Figure 1a. The quality of
the cluster expansion is demonstrated in Figure 1d, where we compare the DFT energy to the
energy predicted using the CE. The ternary compound panel essentially
includes all of the structures that were used in the fitting process.
In addition, we carried out a separate set of DFT calculations for
binary compounds, where each type of compound included a large number
of configurations that were not present when training the expansion.
The ability for the CE to predict the energies of these previously
unencountered configurations illustrates the good transferability
of the expansion. Using the obtained CE, we can quickly evaluate the
total energies for a large number of configurations or for larger
supercells. Figure 1e shows the energies evaluated for a large set of configurations
in the O–OH binary system (gray dots). Also shown are the energies
expected for the purely random mixtures (yellow crosses) and the average
energies (green circles) for the system at room temperature, as obtained
from Monte Carlo simulations.

crosses denote the CE energies for the purely random distributions;
the green circles the CE energies for SQoS structures mimicking the
distributions of functional groups obtained from the MC simulations
at room temperature, and the blue crosses indicate the corresponding
DFT energies.

Finally, we highlight the importance
of the vibrational free energy
contributions in Figure 1b,c. It shows a significant contribution of nearly 1 eV, which obviously
cannot be neglected in the calculation of the Gibbs free energy of
formation. It mostly arises from the zero-point energy, whereas the
change upon approaching room temperature is only about 0.1 eV in all
cases. The large difference between OH- versus O-
and F-terminations arises from the very high frequency of O–H
vibrations. Comparison of the Ti2CT2 and Ti3C2T2 results reveals that each termination
yields very similar free energy contribution; that is, the differences
between the three curves are the same. This suggests that each terminating
atom/group has a fixed contribution to the free energy, and thus for
a mixed surface, we could use the free energies from the pure terminations
weighted according to the composition. This is demonstrated in Figure 1b, which shows the
results for the mixed Ti2C(O0.5OH0.5)2 configuration. Taking the weighted average of pure
terminations yields a free energy contribution differing from the
explicit calculation by only about 20 meV.

Simulated Surface Distribution
of Functional Groups
Surface distributions of functional
groups for Ti2C and
Ti3C2 are obtained using Monte Carlo and the
CE constructed earlier. We use the canonical ensemble, where the concentration
of surface adsorbants is fixed. MC simulations are conducted for 12
structures with different compositions: Ti3C2-(OxOHzF1–x–z)2, where x and z vary from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.25. We first show in Figure 2b–e the surface
structures for equal concentrations of two functional groups (i.e., a binary mixture) on Ti3C2.
We have postprocessed the obtained structures by continuously coloring
the first nearest neighbors of the same type (Figure 2b–d). Fairly similar striped patterns
are observed in all cases typical for strongly mixing species in a
triangular lattice, which is a frustrated system. Figure 2f–h shows the corresponding
fractions of the first and second nearest neighbors averaged over
the simulation cell. Independent of the constituents, the first nearest
neighbor distributions show very similar fractions of about 0.18 between
the “like”-terminations and about 0.65 between the “unlike”-terminations.
In a random alloy, the values would be 0.25 and 0.5, respectively,
meaning that unlike neighbors are overall favored. This, together
with the comparison of the energies for the random and MC (SQoS) results
in Figure 1e, clearly
shows that the surface terminations are not expected to be randomly
distributed. The second nearest neighbor fractions show the opposite
trend, wherein similar terminations are more likely than in random
alloys. This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of O0.5F0.5, which may explain the slightly different
visual appearance.

neighbor

nearest neighbor atoms of the same type are connected by bonds to
highlight the ordering. (a,e) Shows the structure in panel (b) without
the connections and also illustrates how the rectangular region is
cut from the larger Monte Carlo simulation cell.

Figure 3 shows the
MC-simulated distribution of functional groups and the nearest neighbor
fractions for selected ternary structures. We start off with an equal
concentration for each of the three groups, as shown in Figure 3a. Although a binary system
in a triangular lattice is frustrated, a ternary (three-state) system
is not. As seen in Figure 3a, large areas of the ordered phase, where each O is surrounded
by 3 F and 3 OH, etc., arise. This is also reflected
in the fractions showing almost completely unlike-terminations in
the nearest neighbor sites in Figure 3e. It is interesting to note also the phase boundary
structure, as highlighted by the triangles in Figure 3a, where we can identify two types of boundaries:
those where the ordering of the terminations is inverted and those
where the ordering is the same, but the pattern is shifted between
the two grains.

neighbor

(a,c), the triangles illustrate the orientation of the ordered phases.

Surface distribution for a mixture with excess
O [Ti3C2(O0.5OH0.25F0.25)2 in Figure 3b] shows a formation of oxygen containing zigzag stripes,
whereas
OH and F mostly form triangular structures, where a central atom is
surrounded by three atoms of another type. The same kind of arrangement
of functional groups can be seen on the surface with excess OH [Ti3C2(O25OH0.5F0.25)2 in Figure 3d]. The first and second nearest neighbor fractions show the
same tendency for excess O and excess OH (Figure 3f,h), where the first nearest neighbors appear
to be unlike-terminated, and the second nearest neighbors are like-terminated.
This is fully consistent with the results from the binary compounds
in Figure 2. The surface
with excess F [Ti3C2(O0.25OH0.25F0.5)2 in Figure 3c] shows a larger number of fluorine atoms
that have agglomerated to small clusters, whereas the remaining surface
still shows the ordered distribution. Thus, in all of the cases examined
here, the surface terminations strongly favor mixing and do not segregate.

For Ti2C, the results are shown in the Supporting Information and exhibit overall very similar trends.

Properties of Mixed Terminations
Next, we study the
properties of these mixtures by carrying out DFT calculations for
the best representative structures in smaller supercells created using
the special quasi-ordered structures (SQoS) scheme, which is based
on mimicking cluster correlations in MC simulations. The mixing energies,
lattice constants, and work functions as a function of the composition
are shown in Figure 4. We find large mixing energies in accordance with the mixed distributions
in Figures 2, 3, and 1e. The largest energy
gain is found with O- and OH-terminations without any F and reaching
almost −0.4 eV per unit cell. This is a very large energy gain
and clearly much more than kBT for temperatures used during etching and delamination. In the case
of O/F and F/OH mixings, the maximum energy gains are −0.21
and −0.09 eV, respectively. According to Hu et al., the O- and OH/F-terminations lead to oppositely charged Ti-(O/C/F)
octahedra within the MXene sheet,35 thereby
favoring alternating terminations. We propose that there is an additional
contribution arising from the fact that in the case of OH the outermost
H atom is positively charged, whereas in the case of O and F, the
outermost atoms are negatively charged, which leads to attractive
electrostatic interaction. Adding the solvation energy to the mixing
energy only makes the mixing more favored, as shown in the Supporting Information. In the case of Ti2C, the energy surface is overall very similar, but the mixing
energies are somewhat smaller, reaching up to −0.3 eV per unit
cell.

Figure 4 (a) Mixing energy (in eV and per MXene unit cell containing two
surface sites), (b) work function (in eV), and (c) lattice constant
of Ti3C2 (in Å) as a function of the alloy
composition. In (b,c), the numerical values for the end points are
listed.

The work functions are shown in Figure 4b. The OH functionalization
leads to a very
low work function, whereas the work function is high for the O-terminated
surface. The Ti2C results are very similar to those for
Ti3C2, thereby suggesting that the work function
is termination-specific and not material- or composition-specific.
The calculated work functions of terminated Ti2C and Ti3C2 coincide with earlier calculated work function
values reported in ref (36), where it was also found that the work function has a very weak
dependence on the layer thickness; that is, it originates largely
from the surface dipole formation due to terminating groups and not
from changes in the Fermi level. The high work functions of the O-
and F-terminated surfaces are due to charge transfer to these sites,
whereas the low work function of OH-terminated surface is due to the
intrinsic dipole moment (and possibly due to relaxation effect).36 There is no obvious correlation between the
mixing enthalpy and the work function, which indicates that mixing
is not governed by the work function, but it is likely related to
the electrostatics between the terminations, as discussed above.

Measuring of work function is generally challenging, and it is
particularly difficult to simultaneously determine the surface termination
composition. For Ti2C, very few experiments are available
due its instability: for Ti2COHxFy, a
work function of 4.98 eV is reported.37 Experimental work functions for Ti3C2 vary
from 3.4 up to 5.28 eV. A work function of 3.4 eV is reported for
predominantly OH-terminated sheets.38 Work
functions of 4.37 and 4.6 eV are reported in refs (39) and (40). The highest work function
has been reported in ref (16), and although the exact termination is unknown, it was
proposed to arise from protonization of OH with the presence of water,
resulting in formation of O. Nevertheless, none of these values are
close to the calculated limits of 2.0 eV for pure OH-terminated Ti3C2 or 6.2 eV for pure O-terminated Ti3C2, which suggests that the measured samples feature mixing.
We note that when the experimental work function is known, one can
extract from Figure 4b a fairly good estimate for the amount of OH, although the O/F balance
still remains unknown.

Finally, the lattice constants in Figure 4c appear to closely
follow Vegard’s
law. Whereas experimentally determined in-plane lattice constant values
have been reported in a few papers, comparison is difficult because
(i) in calculations, the accuracy of the lattice constants is unknown
even though the composition is known exactly, and (ii) in experiments,
the composition is often unknown even though the lattice constant
might be known fairly accurately.

Gibbs Free Energy of Formation
In the previous section,
we obtained large negative mixing energies which strongly pointed
toward mixing. However, the mixing energies are not enough to predict
the composition under thermodynamic equilibrium. For that, we evaluate
the Gibbs free energy of formation with carefully chosen chemical
potentials.

While during the functionalization the H atom can
be adsorbed from H+ or H2 or H2O,
under equilibrium conditions, the chemical potential for H in all
of these different species is the same. The value for the chemical
potential will be determined by the amount of dissolved HF (i.e., pH), temperature, the equilibrium with water [μ(H2O) = μ(O) + 2μ(H)], and the electron chemical
potential in the case of ionic species. Chemical potentials as a function
of electron chemical potential (work function Φ) for two values
of pH under ambient conditions are shown in Figure 5, where we only show the lowest energy species
at given conditions. Under the conditions present during the MXene
synthesis, these correspond to H coming from H2 or H+ depending on conditions, F from F–, and
O from H2O. From the crossing point of μ(H) lines
corresponding to H2 and H+ (pH = 0), we obtain
a calculated value for the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) of −4.7
eV, which is in good agreement with other computational works34,41 and in fair agreement with the experimental value of −4.44
V.42

Figure 5 Chemical potential of O, F, and H depending
on work function.

Using the calculated
chemical potentials of O, OH, and F, we can
construct the formation Gibbs free energies of pure terminations as
a function of the electron chemical potential and pH. These are shown
in Figure 6, where
the calculated work functions are also indicated. Simply finding the
lowest energy phase at the respective value of Φ would seem
to indicate the formation of a fully O-terminated surface. This, however,
leads to few problems. A work function of 6.1 eV (or +1.4 V vs SHE) is extremely high, even outside the stability range
of water and thus breaking water to O2. Dissolved O2 molecules are known to lead to oxidation of MXenes to TiO2.43,44 Moreover, it is simply at odds with the
experimental reality that always shows a mixture of terminations.

Figure 6 Gibbs
free formation energy of pure OH-, F-, and O-terminated Ti3C2 depending on work function and pH of the solution.

However, that is not the only choice for the work
function. First
of all, it is important to make a difference between the work function
of the final fully terminated surface and the work function during
etching. One could argue that because the terminating group is adsorbed
on a bare surface, the work function of a bare surface would be the
most realistic choice. In addition, it is quite likely that the system
is not under charge equilibrium. Extra electrons can arise from F–, either upon adsorption or upon AlF3 formation,
and from breaking of H2 to 2H+, which are then
accumulated to the MXene sheet, thereby lowering the work function.
F– adsorption should occur frequently during the
etching, as evidenced by the sizable concentration of F-terminations.
The rate of H2 to 2H+ events is not known, but
it should only be relevant at a work function higher than SHE. On
the other hand, electrons can be depleted by adsorbing H+, either changing the O-termination to the OH one or forming H2, which thereby increases the work function until it reaches
SHE. Indeed, etching of MXenes is known to lead to H2 gas
formation.11,45 Putting both of these aspects
together, we suggest that most of the functionalization happens near
the SHE conditions. In the end, using our selected etching work function,
we obtain the composition and the corresponding work function for
the terminated surface, which can be compared to the experimentally
measured ones to check for consistency.

We calculated the Gibbs
free energies of formation for the SQoS
structures obtained earlier at a fixed work function and pH. Figure 7a,b shows the ternary
diagrams of Gibbs free energy of formation for mixed surface terminations
at a fixed work function equal to 4.7 eV and (a) pH = 0 or (b) pH
= 1, which are typical values during the MXene synthesis. For comparison,
we also show in Figure 7c,d the same cases, but in vacuum, that is, excluding the solvation
energy contribution. Inspecting the numbers around the energy minimum
reveals that the solvation energy contribution is relatively minor,
some tens of millielectronvolts, but it tends to lower the energy
of mixed configurations relative to the pure constituents. Generally,
in all cases, the energy minima are found inside the triangles and
are quite significantly lower in energy than those for the pure terminations.
In vacuum, the O0.5F0.5 structure has the lowest
Gibbs free energy at pH = 0, but the energy surface is very flat between
this point and O0.5OH0.5. The change of pH to
1 shifts the minimum energy to the O0.5F0.25OH0.25 mixture. When solvation is included, the energy
minimum lies in both cases close to O0.5F0.25OH0.25. Due to the flatness of the energy surface between
O0.5F0.5 and O0.5OH0.5, even a small solvation energy contribution is sufficient to shift
the location of the energy minimum. Such sensitivity means that our
calculations may not be able to predict the exact composition but
only the dominant stability region.

Figure 7 Gibbs free energies of formation for mixed
terminations at the
work function Φ = 4.7 eV including implicit solvents with (a)
pH = 0 and (b) pH = 1, as well as the vacuum cases for (c) pH = 0
and (d) pH = 1.

In Figure 8a, we
show how the composition at a fixed Φ changes as pH is varied.
The OH concentration remains near 0.25, but for pH >1, the concentration
of O increases and that of F decreases; that is, the minimum of Gibbs
free energy shifts to the composition O0.75OH0.25. This is consistent with the hydrogenation study by Zhan et al., showing H coverage of about 0.3 when the point of
zero charge is close to SHE.29 Finally,
we have also varied the work function Φ from 4.4 to 5.4 eV and
plotted the composition in Figure 8b. At low work function values, we obtain O0.5OH0.5, largely independent of pH (also see Figure 6). At very large work function
values, the pure O-terminated surface is obtained. Only at intermediate
values is it possible to obtain mixtures with marked F concentrations.

Discussion
In
this study, we have combined multiple theoretical approaches
to simulate functionalization of the Ti3C2 and
Ti2C surfaces. Surface distributions of functional groups
over distinct concentrations have been obtained. We have shown that
functional groups are equally distributed without any segregation
regardless of the concentration or the type of the adsorbant. Our
simulation results align with recent experimentally measured data,17,20 where random distributions of terminations were reported. The preference
toward mixing arises from the significant energy gain by mixing and
has been obtained by accounting only structural factors (Figure 4a). On the other
hand, the lowest energy composition of the functional groups on the
surface varies with the electrochemical factors such as the electron
chemical potential Φ, pH, and temperature. We showed that the
lowest energy composition is sensitive to these parameters, but when
choosing values similar to those in experiments, we obtained similar
mixtures of all three components as reported in experiments. Now,
taking the obtained compositions and referring to Figure 4b, the low Φ composition,
O0.5OH0.5, corresponds to a work function of
about 3.5 eV, which is close to the lower limit obtained in experiments.38 The composition O0.5F0.25OH0.25 would result in a work function of about 4.5 eV,
which is consistent with those reported in refs (39) and (40), whereas the high Φ
or high pH composition O0.75OH0.25 leads to
a work function closer to 5 eV, similar to that reported in ref (16).

When comparing
our calculated composition to experimental ones,
the problem is that one can find experimental report to support any
computational finding: similar concentration of all three terminations
in ref (46), O dominance
in ref (18), F dominance
in refs12 and (15), equal O and F versus small OH concentration in ref (20), equal F and OH versus small O concentration in ref (19). Perhaps the most useful
reports are those which report composition changes upon changing synthesis
conditions. For instance, according to Wang et al., going from a 10% HF concentration to 48%, the O/F ratio decreases
from 1.4 to 0.8,19 which qualitatively
agrees with our result that lower pH increases the F concentration.
Although the high sensitivity of the functional group composition
to the experimental conditions may explain part of the results, there
are some discrepancies. Our calculations always resulted in an O concentration
of 50% or more and a relatively small F concentration of 25% or less.
The possible reasons could include local variations in the solution
(content of F– ions, trapped H2, etc.), kinetic factors related to etching, and inaccuracies
in our computational approach.

Although it seems that the surface
composition can be tuned, even
if only within a limited range, how would that affect the material
properties, such as the electrical conductivity? We show the total
and atom-projected densities of states in Figure 9, where we have also indicated the atomic
origins of all the main features. The Fermi level moves down as the
concentration of O increases, as expected due to its large electronegativity
and oxidation state. Nevertheless, the Fermi level is always confined
inside the Ti-d band, and moreover, this band is largely unaffected
by the surface terminations and appears fairly similar in all cases.
Thus, there is likely no dramatic changes in the density of states
at the Fermi level or consequently in the electrical conductivity
(assuming it is governed by the former), especially if considering
only the limited range of compositions. The situation is again very
similar in the case of Ti2C (Figure S7). Whereas pure O-terminated Ti2CO2 should open a band gap at the Fermi level, so far, there are no
experimental reports on the synthesis of pure Ti2CO2, and our calculations show that mixing is again strongly
favored (Figure S5), thereby suggesting
that synthesis of Ti2C with pure O-terminations is difficult.
As a result, our findings cast doubt on the proposed wide tunability
of the surface composition and electronic properties of Ti-based MXenes
and also suggest that calculations based on surfaces with pure terminations
may not provide reliable predictions of MXene properties.

Conclusions
In this study, we have shown that functional groups form mixed
compositions at Ti2C and Ti3C2 surfaces.
Our large-scale simulations show that mixed functional groups are
equally distributed at the surfaces and form ordered arrangements
for certain concentrations. Furthermore, we have constructed Gibbs
free energy diagrams for different concentrations of functional groups
depending on pH and the work function. The analysis shows that formation
of mixed terminations is favorable. Our results show that the tunability
of the surface composition by pH and temperature is limited, and it
does not lead to dramatic changes in electronic properties. Our multiscale
modeling approach for determining the distribution and composition
of functional groups on a surface should be straightforward to apply
to other MXene systems in order to more accurately predict their structures
and properties. Moreover, many other systems, other than MXenes, can
be considered, especially those of solvated nanoparticles.

Methods
Free Energy Calculations
The Gibbs free energy of formation
is given in eq 1. The
free energy of the sheet should include the vibrational contributions
as well as the interaction with the solution. We assume that the two
contributions do not depend on each other and thus 2  where E(MXT)
is the DFT total energy, ΔvibF is
the phonon contribution to the free energy at room temperature evaluated
in vacuum, and ΔsolE is the solvation
energy evaluated at T = 0 using implicit solvation
models. (The pV term can be ignored at p = 1 atm.)

The choice of chemical potentials μi depends on the conditions around the MXene sheet
and the reactions on the surface. Taking as an example one of the
most studied MAX phases, Ti3AlC2, when the etching
is done in water solutions of HF, the following three simplified reactions
have been proposed to take place:11 3   4   5   6  In these reactions,
hydrogen
is always assumed to be in the form of H2. However, considering
that HF dissociates in water to H+ (or H3O+) and F– ions, it seems plausible that the
reactions could involve just the ions, an aspect that has not been
accounted for in the previous studies on MXenes. In this work, we
will consider both scenarios, which, thanks to the adopted method,
is only reflected in the choice of the chemical potentials.

The chemical potentials are obtained by first evaluating the Gibbs
free energies of the elemental phases using DFT and then using experimentally
determined thermochemical quantities to evaluate Gibbs free energy
of the solutes and the solution. Taking O2 as an example,
the DFT energy EDFT(O2) sets
the (absolute) energy scale, which allows us to write the (absolute)
enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of the molecule as 7   8  where Ezp and ΔH° are the zero-point
vibrational energy and the enthalpy of formation for the molecule
(similarly for H2 and F2), respectively. Then,
the Gibbs free energy, or the chemical potential, of water is obtained
as μ(H2O) = μ(O) + 2μ(H) + ΔfG(H2O), where
the formation energy is obtained from the NIST-JANAF tables. On the
other hand, if H is in the form of H+ ions, we also need
to consider the electron chemical potential. The formation energy
of H+ ion is written as 9  where μe is given with respect
to vacuum, that is, μe = μ̃e – μ̃evac. The energy
of solvated ions is obtained from the ion heat of formation in the
gas phase plus the hydration energy. The ion heats of formation are
taken from the NIST-JANAF thermochemical tables and the hydration
energies from refs (47) and (48). We may
also connect this to pH, which is directly related to the H+ concentration in the solution: 10  where c0 = 55.55 mol/L is the concentration of the
H2O
molecules in water. Equations for F– are similar.
A full account of the chemical potential calculations and a list of
all the thermochemical quantities are given in Supporting Information.

Computational Details
Our density functional theory
calculations were carried out in the framework of projector-augmented
waves as implemented in the VASP software package.49 For the exchange-correlation functional, we wanted to choose
one that properly reproduces the formation energies of MXenes. However,
because experimental values are not available, we used TiO2 and water for benchmarking. A full comparison of the heats of formation
calculated using the computational scheme described above and the
respective experimental values are given in Supporting Information. Among the considered functionals (PBE,50 PBE-D3(BJ),51 PBEsol,52 PBEsol-D3(BJ), HSE06,53 SCAN,54 and SCAN+rVV1055), PBEsol seemed to give the best overall agreement with
the experimental enthalpy of formation. Therefore, the MXene sheets
were then calculated using the PBEsol functional.52 The optimal plane-wave cutoff energy was chosen as 550
eV according to a convergence test. The set of 15 × 15 ×
1 k-points was found to be sufficient for the unit
cells of Ti2C and Ti3C2.

Our
calculated lattice constants and work functions are in good agreement
with previous calculations for the fully terminated Ti-based MXenes.24,56−58 The calculated lattice parameters and work functions
are listed in Table 1. The lattice constant has been measured for Ti3C2 and is equal to 3.050 Å.13

Phonons and thermal properties were calculated using
Phonopy.59 The force constants were evaluated
using a 5
× 5 supercell and the thermal properties integrated in 1000 ×
1000 k-point mesh.

Solvation energies were
calculated using VASPsol.60,61 A high cutoff energy
is required to properly describe the interfacial
region between the implicit solution and the surface, in particular,
to construct an appropriate grid for the cavity surface, and therefore,
these calculations are carried out using a cutoff energy of 1000 eV.
We keep the atomic positions fixed to those obtained from vacuum calculations.
For the pure terminations, the solvation energies are very small:
−50, −8, −40, and −9 meV for Ti2C, Ti2CO2, Ti2COH2, and
Ti2CF2, respectively. For the mixed configurations,
we did not assume that the solvation
energy contributions could be obtained using the pure terminations
and averaging them according to the composition. Instead, we carried
out explicit calculations for the solvation energies of the SQoS structures
with the atomic structure fixed to that in vacuum.

The electron
chemical potential μe is evaluated
from the work function of the unsolvated sheets (in vacuum) for each
of the three surface terminations.

Cluster Expansion of Alloy
Energies, Monte Carlo Simulations,
and Special Quasi-ordered Structures
Cluster expansion study
for the mixture of surface terminations was carried out using ATAT.62,63 In order to sample the configuration space, we generate CE for the
three-component (O, OH, F) mixture by fitting to a set of 71 and 106
DFT energies for Ti2C and Ti3C2,
respectively. In addition to atomic positions, we also optimized the
lattice constants. However, accurate effective cluster interactions
require high-quality DFT data as well as the right selection of the
number and type of clusters. For Ti3C2, we have
considered clusters with 3, 6, 10, and 13 pairs and 4 triplets, as
well. The set of 3 pair clusters includes only the first near neighbor
interactions and basically resembles the Ising model. The sets of
6 and 10 clusters include interactions of the lateral first nearest
neighbors as well as interactions between nearest neighbors on the
opposite sides of the slab. The set of 13 pairs and 4 triplets includes
lateral pair interactions up to the second nearest neighbor and the
first nearest neighbor on the opposite sides of the slab. CE predicted
energies are fitted using the least-squares method to the calculated
DFT energies. The fitting quality was evaluated by the cross-validation
(CV) score and by the residual distribution. Residuals were normally
distributed in all cases. A small CV was obtained when including a
set of 13 pair and 4 triplet clusters, that is, 0.008 eV/atom for
Ti3C2 and 0.005 eV/atom for Ti2C
when including a set of 13 pair clusters.

Using the obtained
CE effective interactions, we carried out Monte Carlo simulations
using the program MultiComponent Easy Monte Carlo Code (Memc2) of
ATAT.64 Statistical samplings were performed
in the canonical ensemble (i.e., fixed composition)
within a 40 × 40 × 1 supercell containing 3200 surface atoms.
The Monte Carlo simulations were performed with target precision of
1 meV in the average energy. We started the simulation from high temperatures
(5000 K) and gradually approached room temperature (300 K) with a
temperature step of 200 K. These are used to study the distribution
of adsorbants on the surface.

In order to evaluate the mixing
and Gibbs free energies, work function,
and lattice constants of the structures within different concentrations
of functional groups, we generated representative supercell models
and carried out separate DFT calculations for those. Following the
same construction principles as in generating special quasi-random
structures, but employing the correlations from the MC simulations
instead of random correlations, we generated representative special
quasi-ordered structures (SQoS) with 4 × 4 supercells.65,66 These SQoS supercells are used to evaluate the final material properties.
