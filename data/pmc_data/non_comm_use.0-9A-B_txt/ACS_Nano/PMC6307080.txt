One
of the most attractive commercial applications of semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) is their use in lasers. Thanks to their high quantum
yield, tunable optical properties, photostability, and wet-chemical
processability, NCs have arisen as promising gain materials. Most
of these applications, however, rely on incorporation of NCs in lasing
cavities separately produced using sophisticated fabrication methods
and often difficult to manipulate.
Here, we present whispering gallery mode lasing in supraparticles
(SPs) of self-assembled NCs. The SPs composed of NCs act as both lasing
medium and cavity. Moreover, the synthesis of the SPs, based on an
in-flow microfluidic device, allows precise control of the dimensions
of the SPs, i.e. the size of the cavity, in the micrometer
range with polydispersity as low as several percent. The SPs presented
here show whispering gallery mode resonances with quality factors
up to 320. Whispering gallery mode lasing is evidenced by a clear
threshold behavior, coherent emission, and emission lifetime shortening
due to the stimulation process.

==== Body
Since the
demonstration of amplified
spontaneous emission (ASE) and optical gain in systems composed of
colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs),1,2 these
materials have gained tremendous interest due to their versatile optoelectronic
properties and facile processing. In particular, the tunable photoluminescent
(PL) emission and high quantum yield, excellent photostability, and
nearly temperature-independent gain3 are
the main features promoting NCs for lasing applications. NCs of different
composition (e.g., CdSe/CdS, perovskites) and geometries
(e.g., nanoplatelets, dot-in-rods) have therefore
been thoroughly investigated as gain material for lasers during recent
years.4−11 A major challenge hereby is the nonradiative exciton recombination
by the Auger effect. Only recently, suppressed Auger recombination12 and the first NC lasers with continuous wave
excitation and “nearly zero” lasing thresholds (β
≈ 1) through electrical pumping have been reported.13−15

In the quest to realize efficient NCs-based lasers, NCs have
been
implemented in a large variety of systems and cavities. Today, most
optical cavities are realized as distributed Bragg reflectors, distributed
feedback lasers, or even as waveguide-coupled ring resonators.16,17 The combination of NC size control with a high-quality cavity generally
requires sophisticated and expensive fabrication methods. Importantly,
NC lasing has also been achieved with geometries that are much easier
to fabricate, e.g., by simple drying of films of
the NCs which, under the conditions for which the coffee stain effects
are prevented, can be dried as smooth and thin films.18 However, these systems are operating in the random-lasing
regime, which lacks essential control over a huge number of lasing
modes.8,19−21

Ordered spherical
assemblies of NCs, also known as supraparticles
(SPs),22,23 have recently gained interest due to their
collective properties which differ from those of the composing NCs
and through insights obtained on self-assembly in spherical confinement.22,24,25 For example, recently fabricated
SPs can emit pure colors or can be tailored to allow tunable light
emission (e.g., white light).26 SPs themselves can be made through self-assembly (SA) inside
the spherical confinement induced by slowly drying of oil-in-water
emulsion droplets. By controlling the emulsification procedure, SPs
can be tuned with a specific diameter between 100 and 15000 nm.22,27−29 Furthermore, SPs can be made to be water or oil dispersible
and can be realized as stable dispersions themselves, which strongly
facilitates further processing or application of these systems. Additionally,
it has been shown that the high effective refractive index that is
realizable with SPs made from semiconductor NCs can lead to shape-dependent
modulation of their photoluminescence emission (PL) originating from
whispering gallery modes (WGMs),30 thus
in principle, allowing the optical feedback necessary for obtaining
lasing. Even though WGMs were observed in SPs, amplified spontaneous
emission (ASE), optical gain, or lasing has not been demonstrated
for these systems up to now.

Here, we report on optically pumped
(pulsed laser with pulse duration
of a few picoseconds; see the SI for further
details) whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing from self-assembled
SPs composed of luminescent CdSe/CdS NCs, where the SPs act as both
lasing cavity and gain medium. For very low excitation densities (<58
μJ/cm2), we observe resonance peaks superimposed
on the PL emission of the SPs, associated with WGMs with a quality
factor of about 320. When the excitation exceeds a certain threshold
(58 μJ/cm2), we observe a discrete lasing peak and
an effective 20-fold decrease in line width, superimposed on the WGMs,
evolving into a multimode regime for higher pump pulse fluence. WGM-based
lasing is supported by coherence measurements, showing spatial coherence
over the entire rim of the SPs for a duration comparable to the pump
pulse duration, and by a shortening of the exciton lifetime of almost
3 orders of magnitude.

Results
The synthesis of the SPs
is schematically presented in Figure 1. The building blocks
composing the SPs are CdSe/CdS NCs. They have an average diameter
of 8.6 ± 1.0 nm (average diameter ± standard deviation,
as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)), being composed
of a 3.6 nm diameter CdSe core and 2.5 nm thick CdS shell (Figure 1a) (see the SI for further details). Twice the distance of
the interpenetrating layer of ligands adds 3.8 nm to the interparticle
spacing in our close-packed systems and, because of the monodispersity
of the ligand molecules, reduces the total polydispersity of the particles
to about 8%. A dispersion of these NCs (volume fraction 0.06%) is
used to produce SPs through self-assembly enabled by evaporation of
the apolar phase of an oil-in-water emulsion (see the SI for further details).22 Nearly monodisperse (<5%) droplets of NCs solution (oil phase)
were formed using an in-flow custom-made microfluidic chip (Figure S6), which allows precise control of the
shear forces and of the relative fluxes of the oil and water phases
(Figure 1b,c and Figure S7), thus pinching off droplets of a certain
size.31 After a certain amount of time
(∼6–18 h), which is directly related to the droplet
size and many other factors influencing the flux of oil through the
system, the oil phase dissolves and finally evaporates out of the
water, thus confining the NCs in smaller volumes inducing self-assembly
and, once all oil has gone, creates solid SPs (Figure 1d). The size of the SPs can be precisely
tuned between 5 and 15 μm by controlling the size of the droplets
and the initial volume fraction of NCs in the oil phase (Figure S7). The SPs used in this experiment have
an average diameter of 10.2 ± 0.5 μm, with a low polydispersity
(PD < 5%), and present a smooth spherical shape, as inferred from
SEM pictures (Figure 1d and Figures S1 and S2).

Figure 1 Synthesis procedure based
on an oil-in-water emulsion method. Cyclohexane
droplets containing QDs (a) nearly monodisperse (polydispersity <5%)
(yellow) are made in a microfluidic device (b) through the application
of shear force exerted by the continuous flow of water (blue). The
droplets (c) are then stirred in a vial at room temperature for 6–18
h to allow complete evaporation of the cyclohexane. In the end, we
obtain monodisperse SPs dispersed in water (d). The insets show transmission
electron microscopy image of NCs (a), optical microscopy images of
the device (b) and droplets (c), and scanning electron microscopy
image of SPs (d).

In Figure 2a, absorption
and emission spectra of CdSe/CdS NCs (Figure 1a) are shown. The photoluminescence (PL)
emission is centered at 2.015 eV (615 nm) with a full-width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of 105 meV. The absorption exhibits the lowest excitonic transition
at 2.087 eV (594 nm). The PL emission of a single SP under continuous
wave excitation (CW) is shown in Figure 2. The PL emission of the SPs dispersion is
centered at 2.003 eV (619 nm) with an fwhm of 102 meV. We observe
a small general red shift (12 meV) of the emission spectrum of the
NCs self-assembled in the SPs (Figure 2b inset) compared to the NCs freely dispersed in solution.
Furthermore, the SPs show whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonance
peaks on the low energy side of the emission peak (Figure 2b). This phenomenon, previously
described in the literature for both acoustic waves32 and light waves,33−35 is based on the difference in
refractive index between the material of the SPs (neff ∼ 1.7 for 2 eV and 27 °C; see the SI for details) and the environment (nair ∼ 1), which allows total internal
reflection of the light inside the SP. The higher the index contrast,
the smaller the SP can be without losing the light confinement. WGMs
are formed when the optical path length of a round trip along the
rim of the sphere is a multiple of the wavelength, and they can be
observed as modulation of the PL emission spectrum.30 We attribute the absence of WGM resonance peaks on the
high energy side and the small general red shift of the PL emission
to reabsorption losses as a consequence of the small Stokes shift
typical of semiconductor NCs (Figure 1b). The free spectral range (FSR) of the WGM,36 as obtained from the spacing between two successive
maxima, is   where
λ is the resonance center wavelength, L is
the cavity length (L = 2πR for spherical cavities), and neff is
the effective refractive index. This value is compatible with the
radius R measured through SEM (R = 5 μm, Figures S1 and S2). Additionally,
from the resonance peak width Δλ in the PL spectra, we
are able to extract the quality factor Q = λ/Δλ
of the cavity, which in our case is typically around 320 (Figure 2b). As numerical
simulations using idealized spheres show much higher Q factors (see the SI), the measured value
is probably lower due to surface roughness of the SP and/or other
imperfections in their shape.

Figure 2 (a) Absorption (yellow) and PL emission (blue)

CdSe/CdS NCs. The PL peak maximum is centered at 2.015 eV with a fwhm
of ∼105 meV and (b) PL emission of a single SP. The dashed
gray lines indicate the position of WGM resonance peaks (numbered
P1–5). The PL emission with removed background (blue) highlights
these resonance peaks, which are then fitted with multiple Lorentzian
peaks (red). (c) Emission from a single SP at different pump fluence
(few ps pulse duration): 18 μJ/cm2 (blue), 48 μJ/cm2 (green), 100 μJ/cm2 (orange), and 145 μJ/cm2 (red) at low spectral resolution (300 lines/mm grating);
(c inset) high spectral resolution (1800 lines/mm grating), revealing
peak substructure (shaded regions denote areas used for analysis in

(vertical dashed lines indicate the pump fluence at which new lasing
peaks appear). The colored arrows above the graph indicate the pump
fluence at which the respective spectra of panel (c) and (c inset)
were taken.

Figure 2c shows
PL spectra of a single SP at different excitation fluences. Lasing
is observed at the spectral positions of the WGM resonance peaks with
thresholds as low as 58 μJ/cm2 (pulsed excitation;
see the SI for further details). This threshold
fluence corresponds to an average number of excitons per dots of ⟨N⟩ = 2.5 (using an absorption cross-section σ
= 6 nm2),15 in agreement with
previous observations for similar particles.17,37 The necessary modal gain at threshold can be estimated from the
cavity Q factor by α = (2πneff/Q λ) = 520 cm–1, which is similar to typical values in literature for similar systems
(∼650 cm–1, obtained from 980 cm–1 considering a filling factor of 66% for randomly packed spheres).16 The first lasing peak appears at 1.942 eV (P3
in Figure 2c), at the
same spectral position as one of the modes observed in Figure 2b. This particular mode P3
is the first one to reach the lasing threshold as the effective gain
of other modes is lower because of increasing reabsorption losses
toward the blue side (P4) or lower material gain toward the red side
(P2).

When the excitation fluence is increased, the intensity
of the
lasing peaks increases nonlinearly (Figure 2d), typical for optical gain conditions.
Furthermore, additional lasing peaks are observed, indicating multimode
behavior (from WGM modes that vary with their number of nodes of the
electromagnetic field along the azimuthal and vertical directions
within the SP; see Figure S5c,d) (Figure 2c). This phenomenon
is particularly evident by monitoring the emission with a higher spectral
resolution (Figure 2c inset), where peak substructure also becomes apparent. Multimode
behavior is intrinsically associated with nearly spherical cavities
and broadband emitters, as several almost energetically degenerate
modes exist. For low excitation fluence, only the modes with the highest Q and material gain will be able to lase, while for higher
fluence more modes will fulfill the conditions of modal gain necessary
to reach the lasing regime.

By quantitatively examining the
evolution of the PL emission as
a function of pump fluence (Figure 2d), the threshold characteristics of the different
laser modes can be extracted. We observe that the emission intensity
starts increasing superlinearly at a pump fluence of ∼58 μJ/cm2, corresponding to the lasing threshold, and it keeps increasing
with the same slope efficiency except for certain plateau regions.
The main plateaus correspond to the appearance of new lasing modes
of different longitudinal order that are competing for gain in the
same spatial region (Figure 2c, P2–P4), thus indicating a multimode lasing regime
with mode competition. We extracted the lasing threshold for different
modes to be ∼83 μJ/cm2 for P2 and ∼110
μJ/cm2 for P4 (Figure 2d). For NCs with substantially thicker shells (CdSe/(Cd,Zn)S,
five monolayers (ML) CdS, 1 ML CdZnS, 1 ML ZnS, for a total diameter
of 11.4 ± 1.5 nm; see the SI for further
details), WGM lasing can be observed from the blue side of the PL
peak (due to lower absorption at the NC core) and the shell material
(Figure S8).38 Concerning the peak width, we observe 20-fold decrease in line width
above threshold: below the lasing threshold, P3 shows a line width
of 10 meV, while it has a line width of 0.5 meV slightly above the
threshold. Further above the threshold, the appearance of peak substructure
due to onset of lasing from transversal modes (Figure 2c inset) increases the effective peak width
again. We also note a slight general blue shift of the lasing peaks
with increasing pump intensity, which is most likely due to the change
of effective refractive index caused by bleaching39 or the plasma dispersion effect.40

In Figure 3a, the
temporal first-order coherence of the lasing regime is probed by a
Michelson interferometer (see Figure S4 for details), where the image of the emission is split and recombined
at different delay times between the two interferometer arms. The
spatial coherence is obtained by spatially inverting the image in
one of the arms before recombining the two beams. Below the lasing
threshold, at ∼25 μJ/cm2, we observe only
interference fringes from PL autocorrelation, lasting for few femtoseconds; i.e., no spatially or temporally extended coherence is found.
Above the lasing threshold, at ∼100 μJ/cm2, we observe interference fringes extending over the whole outer
rim of the SP and lasting for several picoseconds (approximately as
long as the pump pulse duration). This temporal and spatial coherence
indicates that (1) the SP is in the lasing regime and that the gain
condition lasts, at least, for the pump pulse duration and (2) that
the lasing we are observing is spatially coherent. In the images,
the light emission is mainly localized at the rim of the SP, as expected
for a WGM. The inhomogeneity along the circumference suggests that
it is actually scattered from the SP by local defects as otherwise
the wavevectors of WGM in perfectly smooth spheres would be tangential,
and therefore, light leaking from the WGM could not be detected with
our geometry where we image the SP from above. In addition to the
well-defined free spectral range between the modes, this extended,
ring-shaped spatial and temporal coherence crucially identifies the
SPs as both cavity and gain media, excluding the appearance of random
lasing in our NC assembly.19

Figure 3 (a) Coherence
measurements performed through a Michelson interferometer
where the emission from the sample is split, spatially inverted, and
delayed in one interferometer arm and then recombined on a camera.
Below the lasing threshold (∼25 μJ/cm2, top
row), only very short and localized coherence is observed, lasting
for few femtoseconds. Above the lasing threshold (∼100 μJ/cm2, bottom row), the spatial coherence extends over the whole
outer rim of the SP, lasting for several ps. (b) PL lifetime measurements
of a single SP. The lifetime below the lasing threshold (in blue,
and exponential fit with offset in black) is approximately 4 ns, while
above the lasing threshold (in red, and Gaussian fit in orange) the
lifetime shortens by almost 3 orders of magnitude, leading to a short
emission pulse with fwhm of 10.7 ps. (c) Polarization measurement
of the emission above lasing threshold. The dumbbell-shaped angular
intensity dependence represents a dominantly linear polarization.

Furthermore, we performed time-dependent
emission measurements
to study the excitation fluence dependent dynamics in the two regimes
(Figure 3b). In the
low excitation regime below the lasing threshold (∼25 μJ/cm2), the SPs show an average PL lifetime of 4 ns, in agreement
with a decay mainly governed by spontaneous emission. However, for
higher excitation fluence above the lasing threshold (∼ 100
μJ/cm2), we observe a dramatic shortening of the
emission lifetime by almost 3 orders of magnitude (fwhm of the emitted
pulse is 10.7 ps) as a consequence of stimulated emission, further
confirming lasing in the SPs. The spectral line width of 0.5 meV is
about three times larger than the Fourier limit of 0.17 meV, suggesting
that additional spectral broadening from multimode lasing or spectral
chirping occurs.

Additionally, we investigated the polarization
of the emission
of single SPs (Figure 3c). Under lasing conditions, the emission shows a dumbbell angular
dependency that indicates dominantly linear polarization. In principle,
for a WGM propagating perfectly parallel to the substrate, unpolarized
emission should be detected in a spatially integrating detector above
the SP. The observed linear polarization, whose axis varies in orientation
from SP to SP, could therefore arise from a tilted WGM propagation
plane (as supported by FDTD simulations, see Figure S5). Another reason could be the inhomogeneity of scattering
around the WGM circumference (see discussion above; the ring in Figure 3a is not continuous)
that scatters the respective local polarization orientation into the
detector. Hence, seemingly linear polarization could be an artifact
from the difference in scattering intensities around the circumference
of the SP.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we created an optically
pumped WGM-based laser using
self-assembled SPs composed of CdSe/CdS NCs, achieving thresholds
as low as 58 μJ/cm2. In addition to drastic peak
narrowing and nonlinear emission, lasing is confirmed by shortening
of the exciton lifetime by 3 orders of magnitude and by spatially
and temporally extended coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that
high-quality optical microresonators can be fabricated through controlled
self-assembly of colloidal NCs, where the superstructure acts as both
laser resonator and gain medium, avoiding the need for a separate
lasing cavity fabrication and NCs positioning inside it. Notably,
the SPs preserve their properties over many weeks of experiments without
showing any significant degradation or stability issues. The applicability
of the SP synthesis to every shape of NC (i.e., nanoplatelets,
nanorods41,42) and the excellent control over the SP size
through microfluidics makes these structures versatile and potentially
valuable for several applications. The SPs’ compatibility with
water allows them to be used in microfluidics and biocompatible sensors.
In fact, the sensitivity of WGM to the local environment could be
exploited for sensors for biological43 or
security applications.44 Such active microlasers
provide significant sensitivity improvement over sensors that use
passive WGM resonators due to the high nonlinearity and sensitivity
to additional absorption near the threshold as well as amplification
and line-narrowing associated with the laser process.

Methods
Chemicals
Sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS, ≥ 98.5%),
dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Mw 670000 g/mol), and cyclohexane (anhydrous, 99.5%) were
all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.

Synthesis
and Characterization of the SPs
The synthesis
was performed in open air adapting a procedure from the literature.22 First, the CdSe/CdS solution of NCs in cyclohexane
in a concentration of ∼1 mg/mL was prepared (volume fraction
of ∼0.0006). Then a water solution made of 10 mL of milli-Q
water containing 60 mg of SDS, the surfactant, and 0.4 g of dextran
was prepared. The emulsification was performed using a custom-made
microfluidic chip (see below for a more detailed description). For
this experiment, we used flow rates of 1000 μL/h for the water
phase and 200 μL/h for the NC dispersion, which produced droplets
of 109 ± 4 μm of diameter (Figure S1a). The so-formed emulsion was collected in a vial containing water
solution saturated with cyclohexane (to slow down the evaporation).
The emulsion was then stirred at room temperature for 6–18
h (depending on the droplet size) in a cylindrical vial (height of
57.5 mm and diameter of 27.3 mm), which was covered on the top by
a layer of parafilm pierced by several 0.8 mm holes to allow all of
the cyclohexane to evaporate. Through the spherical confinement of
the evaporating droplet, the NCs were pushed together to form the
SPs. The so-formed SPs had a diameter of 10.2 ± 0.5 μm,
which considering the initial volume fraction and the size of the
droplets, is in agreement with our predictions of size, considering
conservation of the mass of the NCs during the self-assembly. After
the evaporation, the SPs were precipitated by centrifugation (3000
rpm for 20 min) and redispersed in milli-Q water. The SPs show a smooth
surface and homogeneous internal distribution of the NCs (Figure S2). To prepare the samples for the experiment,
the water solution of SPs was deposited on a silicon substrate, and
then the water phase was evaporated to leave the SPs on the substrate.
The same sample was used for the lasing measurements and for the SEM
imaging.

Simulation
For simulations of the
SPs optical behavior,
we used a freely available FDTD software package (see the SI for further information).45

Optical Characterization
The PL
emission of a single
SP shown in Figure 2b was measured using a continuous wave (CW) excitation source at
405 nm wavelength with ∼2 μm beam diameter and collected
through a 100× microscope objective with numerical aperture NA
= 0.5. For all lasing measurements, we used a frequency-doubled regenerative
amplifier seeded by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser, resulting in
laser pulses of 100–200 fs duration with a repetition rate
of 1 kHz. This light was coupled to a 1 m long multimode optical fiber
with 10 μm core diameter to achieve a beam which was more homogeneous
than a Gaussian beam (it is more like a flat-top profile) and pulse
stretching to several picoseconds pulse duration. An image of the
beam profile and a cross section of the excitation beam on the sample
are shown in Figure S3. The pump intensity
was controlled with a movable gradient filter after the fiber. The
excitation beam was focused with a long working distance apochromatic
microscope objective (10 × , NA = 0.26) to a spot with fwhm =
10 μm on the sample. The SPs of ∼10 μm diameter
fit completely into the flat-top region of the beam profile.

The emitted light from the SPs is collected through the same objective
lens. Suitable long-pass filters are used to block the excitation
light. The emission is detected by a fiber-coupled spectrograph (0.5
m focal length monochromator, 300 lines/mm, and 1800 lines/mm gratings)
equipped with a liquid N2-cooled CCD (charge-coupled device)
for the spectral measurements. The coherence measurements in Figure 3a were recorded using
a Michelson interferometer (Figure S4).
Here, the light from the sample is split with a nonpolarizing beam
splitter cube, recombined, and focused after the Michelson interferometer
on a cooled CCD, resulting in real-space interferograms. At the end
of one interferometer arm, a hollow retroreflector is mounted on a
motorized linear stage with an additional piezo actuator which inverts
the image and provides an adjustable delay. The luminescence lifetimes
shown in Figure 3b
were recorded using a time-correlated single photon counting system
with fiber-coupled avalanche photodiode (50 ps time resolution) for
measurements below lasing threshold and a streak camera (2 ps time
resolution) for measurements above the lasing threshold. The polarization
in Figure 3c was probed
using full rotation of a linear polarizer (extinction >10000:1)
mounted
on a motorized rotation stage directly after the collecting objective
lens. The radial scale in the plot depicts the intensity and the angular
angle of the polarizer.
