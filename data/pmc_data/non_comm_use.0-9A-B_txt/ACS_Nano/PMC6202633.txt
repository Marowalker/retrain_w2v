In this work, we introduce an asymmetric
membrane as a simple and
robust nanofluidic platform for digital detection of single pathogenic
bacteria directly in 10 mL of unprocessed environmental water samples.
The asymmetric membrane, consisting of uniform micropores on one side
and a high density of vertically aligned nanochannels on the other
side, was prepared within 1 min by a facile method. The single membrane
covers all the processing steps from sample concentration, purification,
and partition to final digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP). By simple filtration, bacteria were enriched and partitioned
inside the micropores, while inhibitors typically found in the environmental
samples (i.e., proteins, heavy metals, and organics)
were washed away through the nanochannels. Meanwhile, large particles,
indigenous plankton, and positively charged pollutants in the samples
were excluded by using a sacrificial membrane stacked on top. After
initial filtration, modified LAMP reagents, including NaF and lysozyme,
were loaded onto the membrane. Each pore in the asymmetric membrane
functioned as an individual nanoreactor for selective, rapid, and
efficient isothermal amplification of single bacteria, generating
a bright fluorescence for direct counting. Even though high levels
of inhibitors were present, absolute quantification of Escherichia coli and Salmonella directly in an unprocessed environmental sample (seawater and pond
water) was achieved within 1 h, with sensitivity down to single cell
and a dynamic range of 0.3–10000 cells/mL. The simple and low-cost
analysis platform described herein has an enormous potential for the
detection of pathogens, exosomes, stem cells, and viruses as well
as single-cell heterogeneity analysis in environmental, food, and
clinical research.

==== Body
Intestinal
parasitic infections
and diarrheal diseases, which are caused by waterborne pathogens,
have become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, owing to insufficient
hygiene and poor sanitation.1,2 More than 2.2 million
people die each year because of waterborne pathogen infections, with
a resulting economic loss of nearly 12 billion U.S. dollars annually
worldwide.3 Given the low infectious dose
of many waterborne pathogens, the presence of even a single bacterium
in the environment may pose a serious health risk.4 According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
the concentration of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococci in environmental recreational samples should be less than 1.26 and
0.35 CFU/mL, respectively.5 These strict
standards require a detection method that is not only ultrasensitive
but also quantitative and precise.

Culture-based methods remain
the “gold standard”
for bacteria identification and titration, although they require days
to obtain the results and hardly differentiate bacteria at the species
levels.6 Quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reactions (PCR) can shorten the time to several hours, but it
requires expensive instrumentation and is poorly suited for absolute
quantification.7 Droplet-based microfluidics
have emerged as promising methods for digital cell quantification,
as well as single-cell heterogeneity analysis.8,9 In
this case, each cell is encapsulated into an individual droplet, and
the specific cell information (e.g., specific DNA,10−18 RNA,19−23 proteins,24−26 enzymes,27 metabolism,28,29 and antibodies30,31) will be converted to a fluorescence
signal and thus enable direct counting.32 This “digital format” allows simple, rapid, and multiplexed
detection of specific cell strains in the samples from commensal ones.33 However, the concentration of pathogenic bacteria
in environmental samples is typically beyond the detection limit of
most microfluidic devices due to their limitation to microliter samples.
To detect bacteria less than 1 cell per mL, at least several milliliters
of samples have to be analyzed, no matter how sensitive the detection
method is. For most chips, it would take several hours or days for
bulk sample loading (even more for nanofluidics), which is not only
a waste of time and precious bioreagents but also inactivate biochemical
reaction.34,35 In addition, multiple sample pretreatment
steps are still required for crude samples to remove inhibitors, exclude
particles, enrich bacteria, or extract DNA before ultimate analysis.
Furthermore, accessing microfluidics, especially nanofluidics, typically
calls for elaborate chip fabrication and sophisticated fluid control
(e.g., pump, vacuum, centrifuge, or valve), limiting
their accessibility to users without related expertise and instruments.36

In this work, instead of using conventional
micro/nanofluidic chips,
we report on the use of a membrane for the digital detection of single
bacteria in 10 mL of unprocessed environmental water samples within
1 h. The complete heterogeneous membrane system is composed of a sacrificial
prefilter and an asymmetric micro/nanochannel membrane, as illustrated
in Figure 1. The asymmetric
membrane, containing highly ordered micropores (25 μm) on the
top and a high density of vertically aligned nanochannels (400 nm)
on the bottom, was prepared within 1 min by glass-transition-induced
bonding. The strong sealing and vertical orientation of nanochannels
ensure the perfect isolation of each pore without cross-contamination.
During the filtration, large particles and positively charged pollutants
are removed by the sacrificial prefilter on the top, while bacterial
cells can pass through and then concentrate inside the micropores.
Meanwhile, small inhibitors typically found in environmental samples,
such as proteins, humic acids, organics, and heavy metals, passed
through the nanochannels and washed away. After initial filtration,
modified loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse
transcription-LAMP (RT-LAMP) reagents, including NaF and lysozyme,
are loaded into the asymmetric membrane for direct, rapid, and efficient
amplification of a single bacterium within the isolated pores. By
direct counting of positive pores, absolute quantification of E. coli and Salmonella in unprocessed seawater and pond water samples was achieved within
1 h, with a dynamic range from 0.3 to 10000 cells/mL. In contrast,
direct bacteria detection in these environmental samples by conventional
methods completely failed. Furthermore, the membranes are inexpensive
(less than 0.1 U.S. dollar) and easily prepared on a large scale.
Therefore, they can be thrown away (disposable) after each use, avoiding
subsequent LAMP contamination.

Results and Discussion
Asymmetric Membrane Preparation
The asymmetric membrane
with large micropores on one side and high-density nanochannel arrays
on the other side is the key component of the complete heterogeneous
membrane system. To function as a nanofluidic system for digital bacteria
counting, the asymmetric membrane should share the following features:
(i) All the uniform micro/nanochannels should be vertically aligned
without interconnection. (ii) The micropores on one side of membrane
should be large enough (>20 μm) for visual counting, and
the
nanochannels on other side should be smaller than 400 nm for bacteria
capture. (iii) A strong bonding is necessary between the microchannels
and nanochannels. (iv) To enable rapid manual filtration, a high density
of nanochannels was required to lower the applied pressure and increase
the flow rate. (v) The membrane should possess excellent mechanical/chemical/thermal
stability.

Track-etching technique has become the main route
for preparing symmetric membranes containing numerous vertically aligned
nanochannels.37 To obtain asymmetric membranes,
many strategies have been employed, such as asymmetric etching,38,39 asymmetric modification,40,41 or asymmetric combination.42,43 However, most preparation processes are complicated and not suitable
for conventional laboratories. Herein, we report a simple and robust
method for the preparation of asymmetric membranes utilizing conventional
symmetric track-etched membranes. Two symmetric track-etched polycarbonate
(PC) membranes (commercially available) are stacked together and then
heated at 165 °C on a hot plate for 1 min (see schematic illustration
in Figure S1 and details in the Experimental Section). After the short heating duration,
the two membranes are irreversibly bonded together. Figure 2a shows a photograph of an
asymmetric membrane with perfect sealing. We attribute the bonding
mechanism to the glass transition properties of the thermoplastic
material. The polycarbonate has a glass transition temperature of
∼150 °C.44 Above this temperature,
the membranes undergo a transition from a glassy state to a rubbery
state, where they become soft while the micro/nanostructure remains
unchanged. The long-range motion of the polymer chains in the rubbery
state facilitates the tight adhesion of two membranes. Figure 2b shows a top-view scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of the asymmetric membrane, confirming
the presence of uniform micropores on its top surface. The pore size
was measured to be 25 μm, and the pore density was about 104 pores/cm2. The pore size was uniform, as confirmed
by the size distribution results (see Figure S2). Magnification of the images reveals the high density of nanochannels,
with diameters of 400 nm, within each micropore (Figure 2c). Compared to the original
membranes, the morphology of micropores and nanochannels has not changed
after the heat treatment (see detailed characterization in Figure S3). The cross-sectional view SEM image
of the asymmetric membrane also demonstrates the presence of micropores
on the top and vertically aligned nanochannels at the bottom, as shown
in Figure 2d. The two
membranes were indeed bonded tightly without any gap. It should be
noted that, in these experiments, a strong bonding is crucial for
the asymmetric membrane to prevent it from splitting during filtration
with applied pressure. The successful sealing and parallel perpendicular
nanochannels ensure the isolation of each pore and prevent cross-contamination.
In addition to the mentioned size and materials, the asymmetric membranes
combined with other pore size (range from 200 nm to 30 μm) and
other materials (polyester) could also be successfully prepared, as
shown in Figure 2e–h
and Figure S4.

(h). The scale bars are 5 μm. (i) Fluorescence microscope image
of an asymmetric membrane after sample loading.

The wettability of membranes before and after thermal treatments
was also tested, as shown in Table S1.
The contact angle of LAMP solution on PC membranes increased slightly
after thermal bonding, from 40 ± 3 to 50 ± 2° for membranes
with 25 μm pore size and from 47 ± 3 to 54 ± 4°
for membranes with 400 nm pore size. The low contact angles indicate
that solutions can easily enter the micropores and nanochannels. Reagents
could be loaded into each pore of the prepared asymmetric membrane,
as illustrated in Figure S5 (see also the Experimental Section for details). Twenty-five microliters
of sample was added onto the asymmetric membrane. Due to the capillary
forces, the pores were easily wetted. The wetted membrane was then
sealed between two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films to remove residual
reagents from the membrane surface. In order to prevent water evaporation,
the top piece of PDMS was peeled off, followed by addition of mineral
oil to cover the whole membrane. As shown in the fluorescence image
(Figure 2i), each pore
was filled with 13 pL of sample solution. A wide-view image is also
shown in Figure S6, illustrating the successful
loading and partitioning of the sample. To verify that no cross-contamination
exists between pores, photobleaching tests were conducted.12 Membranes loaded with fluorescent solution were
exposed to UV light for 3 min, resulting in a patterned area with
relatively weak fluorescence (see Figure S7). If cross-contamination occurred, dye molecules would diffuse between
pores and the bleached pattern would vanish with time. However, in
our case, the pattern did not change after the illumination and an
extended period of observation. We repeated these experiments several
times, using different membranes at different positions, and similar
results were obtained. The perfect isolation of pores can also be
proven by the following LAMP experiments on asymmetric membranes,
as discussed later, at low bacteria concentration (see Figure S8).

Filtration
The
asymmetric membrane was applied for
the filtration of an E. coli sample
using a syringe pushed by hand. Due to the high density of microchannels
and nanochannels, water passed through the membrane rapidly, and a
1 mL sample was filtered within 5 s. The air in the syringe behind
the solution could push all the sample out of the filter without a
dead volume. Meanwhile, the numerous parallel nanochannels in the
membrane also alleviated clogging, as the occlusion of any single
nanopore resulted in the diversion of the flow to nearby pores.45 After filtration, E. coli were randomly captured inside each micropore, whereas proteins,
organics, nucleic acid, ions, and other small molecules passed through
the nanochannels and were washed away.46,47Figure 3a shows stained E. coli (green dots) within the circular micropores.
All the bacteria were captured and distributed randomly inside the
micropores. No bacteria were found outside the pores, even if a relatively
high concentration was used (Figure S9).
At this concentration, an average of 2.2 E. coli were trapped in a single pore, and the statistic number of E. coli in each pore was also fit well with Poisson
distribution (see Figure 3b). To test the capture efficiency, we measured the concentration
of E. coli in the original sample,
as well as in the filtrate, by standard bacteria culture and fluorescence
enumeration (see Experimental Section). Results
show that nearly 99.9% of E. coli were
captured on the membrane (Figure S10).
This excellent capture efficiency resulted from the outstanding size
exclusion and electrostatic repulsion of the nanochannels, even under
high flow rates.

and Nylon membranes, respectively. (d) Numerical simulation of fluidic
flow profile inside the filter through the asymmetric membrane. (e)

(f) Simulated statistical number of particles at each x position of the asymmetric membrane.

In addition to bacterial enrichment, the membrane also provides
an easy way for sample purification. During filtration, small inhibitors
or interference molecules in the samples could be washed away through
the nanochannels. However, for complex environmental samples, the
presence of various large particles and organisms would easily block
the asymmetric membrane or inhibit the following enzyme-driven nucleic
acid amplification processes. To solve this challenge, a sacrificial
track-etched PC membrane with uniform microchannels and negatively
charged channel surface was introduced and stacked above the asymmetric
membrane for sample prefiltration. The function of this sacrificial
layer was to exclude all large particles and adsorb positively charged
matters but not to obstruct the passage of target bacteria. Therefore,
we tested the E. coli permeation rate
through the prefilter. As shown in Figure 3c (blue circles), the track-etched PC membranes
exhibit a nearly 100% permeation rate for E. coli, even when their pore size was only 2 μm, which was only slightly
larger than the size of E. coli (∼1
μm). Upon further decrease of the pore size to 1 μm, the
permeation of E. coli was significantly
decreased to 5%, exhibiting a perfect cutoff curve for bacterial sieving.
This sharp cutoff property was indeed a characteristic behavior of
isoporous membranes (membranes with highly ordered channels),48 as track-etched PC membranes have ideal cylinder
channel arrays and well-defined pore sizes. In contrast, conventional
nylon membranes and PES membranes, which have irregular and intercrossed
pore structures, show a poor cutoff performance. Bacteria were easily
trapped within the pore networks of the nylon and PES membranes even
when 5 μm pore size membranes were used (see Figure 3c). The sharp cutoff provided
by PC membranes also offers the opportunity to collect bacteria/viruses/exosomes
at different layers if membranes with different channel sizes were
to be connected in sequence.49

For
digital single-cell detection and analysis, the cells should
be dispersed homogeneously on the entire asymmetric membrane. To verify
this, we conducted finite element analysis, using COMSOL to compute
the flow field, as well as particle trajectories when a solution passes
through the asymmetric membrane. Figure 3d shows the flow profile inside the filter.
The fluidic flow was dispersed before being passed through the asymmetric
membrane. To quantitatively investigate the transmembrane flow, the
flow rates across the membrane were recorded at each position. As
shown in Figure 3e,
a pulse-shaped curve was found, which can be attributed to the water
flow through the porous membrane. Each peak represents the flow rate
through one micropore. It can be seen that the fluidic flow rate through
all the pores was found to be equal. However, other than water or
small molecules, the cells in the fluid are subject to additional
drag force and inertial force, resulting in different cell motion
profiles. Therefore, particle trajectories were also simulated. The
size of particles was set to 1 μm, and density was 1100 kg/m3, similar to the parameters of E. coli.50 After particles were introduced at
the inlet, they dispersed well under the flow profile and were captured
inside the micropores (see Movie S1). The
particle counts along the membrane are almost constant, indicating
uniform distribution (Figure 3f). All of the results above demonstrate that the micro/nanochannel
membrane can be applied for bacterial capture, concentration, purification,
and homogeneous partition via one-step simple filtration.
In typical droplet-based assays, cell encapsulation requires several
hours, especially for large sample volumes, causing cell sedimentation,
protein inactivation, or cell damage.34 The membrane filtration here was completed within 5 s, which significantly
reduces the waiting time and circumvents these problems.

Digital Single
Bacteria LAMP
After initial one-step
filtration, the prefilter was thrown away, and a LAMP reagent mix
(25 μL) was loaded inside each pore of the asymmetric membrane
as discussed above for in situE.
coli LAMP (see Experimental Section). During 65 °C incubation, each pore of the asymmetric membrane
functioned as an individual nanoreactor for template amplification,
generating a bright fluorescence if a target bacterium was inside.
We chose LAMP because it is fast and robust, without the need for
thermal cycling.51,52 However, as opposed to PCR, which
applies a preheating (95 °C) step to denature proteins or lyse
cells, the Bst polymerase used in the LAMP cannot
withstand high temperature. Therefore, single E. coli LAMP in an ultrasmall nanoreactor was easily inhibited (Figure S11). Herein, we report a modified assay
for one-step single bacteria LAMP within each pore.

To investigate
in detail, we performed real-time LAMP experiments in a tube, followed
by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In order to mimic the concentration
of bacteria inside the pores, samples with high concentrations of
108 cells/mL were used. As seen in Figure 4a, the reaction for E. coli shows a very weak fluorescence, similar to that of the negative
control background. However, the gel electrophoresis results indicate
the target E. coli DNA was indeed successfully
amplified (Figure S12). A similar phenomenon
was also observed when attempting to detect Salmonella (Figure 4a). Thus,
false-negative results were likely caused by inhibitors in the bacterial
lysate, which attenuates the fluorescence signal. In our current LAMP
assay, a calcein-Mn2+ indicator was employed for fluorescence
reading because of its high signal-to-background ratio. Before amplification,
the calcein dye was quenched by the Mn2+ and a weak fluorescence
was observed. After successful amplification, a large amount of DNA
was synthesized, yielding a substantial pyrophosphate as a byproduct.
The pyrophosphate ions cause the precipitation of Mn2+ and
the subsequent release of calcein, thus generating a bright fluorescence.
We suppose that the false-negative results were attributed to the
pyrophosphatase found in bacteria. The pyrophosphatase is a ubiquitous
enzyme existing in most organisms for energy metabolism.53 It is capable of hydrolyzing pyrophosphate ions
to phosphate ions, and thus Mn2+ will no longer be precipitated.54 Therefore, the fluorescence of calcein was always
quenched. This assumption was confirmed by the observation that no
turbidity was observed for bacteria LAMP, although its DNA was successfully
amplified. The activity of pyrophosphatase can be inhibited by fluoride
ions.55 As shown in Figure 4a, fluorescence was restored for E. coli and Salmonella samples after including 2 mM NaF into the LAMP reaction, which is
nearly 10-fold higher compared to the nontemplate negative control.

(b) Real-time fluorescence measurements of the LAMP reaction in a
tube with E. coli or extracted DNA
(by bead beating). Lysozyme was included in this reaction with a concentration
of 0.1 mg/mL. (c) End-point fluorescence image of membrane after LAMP
using modified reagents.

Robust single bacteria LAMP also requires efficient cell
lysis.
Lysozyme is known for its ability to degrade the peptidoglycans of
the bacteria cell wall.56 However, the
presence of lysozyme in the reaction inhibits the PCR process and
should be removed before amplification.57 By including lysozyme into the LAMP reaction, the bacterial lysis
proceed simultaneously during the isothermal amplification. Effective
lysis was proved by the real-time fluorescence results, which shows
a coincident amplification curve and the same time-to-detection value
for E. coli and its extracted DNA when
lysozyme was included (Figure 4b). Meanwhile, the fluorescence enumeration results also demonstrate
that almost all of the E. coli disappeared
after incubation with lysozyme in the tube at 65 °C (see Figure S13). However, for the sample containing
lower bacterial concentration, lysozyme may not work well and lysis
efficiency decreased (Figure S14). This
issue can be addressed by the membrane system, as each single bacterium
encapsulated inside a small pore has an ultrahigh concentration, regardless
of the bulk bacteria concentration.

The modified LAMP mix including
2 mM NaF and 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme
was loaded onto the asymmetric membrane for digital E. coli LAMP. As shown in Figure 4c, LAMP was successfully performed on the
membrane. The pores with target bacteria inside generated a bright
fluorescence, whereas those without target bacteria showed a weak
background signal. The concentration of target bacteria in the sample
can be obtained by direct counting of the positive pores and calibrated
by Poisson distribution. The success rate for single E. coli LAMP was as high as 97% (Figure S15). Nucleic acid amplification in an ultrasmall chamber,
especially with nanoporous structures, is particularly challenging
due to severe adsorption of macromolecules or DNA.12 However, digital nucleic acid amplification was still successfully
performed in our nanofluidic partitioned system with a high density
of nanochannels. As the bacteria were captured inside the pores first
and LAMP reagents were loaded subsequently, the lysis process is restricted
to each isolated pore, avoiding prerelease of cell information. All
these results demonstrate the successful one-step single bacteria
LAMP within each pore using a modified LAMP mixture.

Anti-inhibition
and Performance in Unprocessed Samples
Raw environmental
samples typically contain a variety of complex
chemical and biological components that will affect the LAMP process.
Direct detection of trace amounts of bacteria in these unprocessed
samples is difficult and challenging. Herein, we attempted to detect
and quantify an extremely low concentration of spiked E. coli in a 10 mL environmental sample directly,
using the asymmetric membrane LAMP system (mLAMP). Seawater samples
were collected from the Pacific Ocean near Santa Monica, CA. When
the sample was analyzed by mLAMP, the large particles, sand, and planktons
in the sample were retained by the prefilter on top of the asymmetric
membrane (Figure S16), whereas the small
inhibitory molecules were washed away through the underlying nanochannels.
Meanwhile, the trace amounts of E. coli were concentrated in the micropores. Successful quantification of
the spiked E. coli in seawater was
achieved by mLAMP with a high recovery rate of 95%, as shown in Figure 5a (mLAMP column).
The high recovery rate is attributed to full integration of the entire
procedure on a membrane system, which minimizes potential sample loss.
Meanwhile, no inhibition from the complex seawater matrix was observed,
as there were no significant differences for E. coli quantification in seawater or in distilled water (p > 0.05). For comparison, conventional digital LAMP was also performed
for E. coli quantification in seawater.
In this case, 22.5 μL of LAMP reagent was mixed with 2.5 μL
of the seawater sample first and then loaded inside the pores of the
membrane for digital amplification. As seen in Figure 5a (digital LAMP column), the LAMP reaction
was completely inhibited, and not a single positive pore was observed.
This effect may be due to the presence of high levels of inhibitors
(heavy metals or organic matters) in seawater. It should be noted
that, in this case, the concentration of inhibitors was already diluted
10 times by the LAMP reagents. The inhibition effect is still significant
when a further diluted seawater sample (10 times dilution, abbreviated
as 0.1×) was used. Only 50% of pores show successful single bacteria
LAMP, and the observed final fluorescence was lower than normal. A
severe inhibition pattern was also observed for real-time LAMP performed
in a tube. Due to the poor sensitivity of real-time LAMP, a high concentration
of E. coli (5 × 104 cells/mL) was spiked in the sample. However, the LAMP reaction was
still totally inhibited when raw seawater was used (Figure 5a, real-time LAMP column).
When a 10-fold diluted seawater sample was used, the fluorescence
appeared but with a significant time delay. This delayed amplification
resulted in an increased time-to-detection value and, therefore, underestimated
the target concentration in the sample. All of these results demonstrate
the excellent performance of our mLAMP in terms of anti-inhibition
for direct digital bacteria detection in complex samples.

in unprocessed environmental seawater samples.
(a) Recovery of E. coli for different
quantification methods in DI water, seawater, or 10× diluted
seawater. Recovery was defined as the percentage of E. coli detected in comparison to the originally
spiked concentration. The concentration of spiked E.
coli in the sample was 50 cells/mL for mLAMP and digital
LAMP, whereas that for real-time LAMP was 5 × 104 cells/mL.
(b) Comparison of measured E. coli concentrations
to the spiked concentrations. The black points were measured using
10 mL of seawater, and the blue point was obtained using only 1 mL
of seawater. (c–g) End-point fluorescence images of membranes
after mLAMP analysis of seawater with a series of spiked E. coli concentrations. All the scale bars are 0.5
mm.

mLAMP exhibits excellent performance
toward absolute quantification
of E. coli at extremely low concentrations,
ranging from 0.3 to 10000 cells/mL, in seawater, with single-cell
sensitivity. As shown in Figure 5b–g, with more E. coli in the sample, the membrane shows more positive pores. A good linear
correlation was observed between the detected absolute number of E. coli and the actual number of cells spiked into
the sample. Because there is a large error for preparing a single
cell in the sample, the lower detection limit (LDL) is defined as
the concentration which would have a 95% chance of having at least
one bacterium in the sample and equals the concentration of three
bacteria per sample.58 The LDL in our case
was 0.3 cells/mL. At this concentration, there were around three positive
pores visible on the whole membrane, corresponding to 3 bacteria in
the 10 mL sample (see Figure S17).

In addition, the detection of pathogenic Salmonella in turtle pond water was also demonstrated by membrane-based RT-LAMP
(mRT-LAMP). Reptiles, like turtles, may carry Salmonella bacteria, which cause diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting,
fever, and headaches.59 Indeed, the multistate
outbreak of Salmonella in the United
State during 2015 and 2017 was linked to contact with turtles carrying Salmonella.60 We collected
the sample from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) turtle
pond. The turtle pond water was more turbid with suspended green algae
and mud. These particles were successfully removed by the prefilter
and nanochannels (see Figure S16). Primers
specific to the gene marker STY1607 were used to detect the corresponding
mRNA as well as DNA.61 Due to the variations
of mRNA copies from cell to cell, it is hard to quantify target cells
by detecting the number of mRNAs. However, mRT-LAMP circumvents these
difficulties as each Salmonella bacterium
was encapsulated inside a single pore, and thus, the contained nucleic
acids, no matter how many, were amplified, resulting in a bright fluorescence.
Absolute quantification of spiked Salmonella in pond water was realized for 3–10000 cells/mL, as shown
in Figure S18.

Conclusion
In
this work, we present the rapid, sensitive, and precise quantification
of single pathogenic bacteria in milliliters of unprocessed environmental
samples on an asymmetric membrane through simple filtration and LAMP
amplification. An asymmetric membrane with micropores on one side
and nanochannels on the other side was prepared within 1 min without
the need for specialized equipment or harsh conditions. The membrane
was capable of bacteria capture, concentration, purification, partition,
lysis, and digital LAMP without off-membrane sample treatments. Even
in unprocessed environmental sea and pond water with a high level
of inhibitors, direct quantification of E. coli and Salmonella was realized with
a sensitivity down to single cell and dynamic range of 0.3–10000
cells/mL.

Compared with other digital single-cell detection
methods, the
membrane LAMP system, mLAMP, exhibits many advantages: (i) Ten milliliter
samples can be processed on the membrane within seconds, while still
keeping minimum consumption of precious bioreagents. (ii) All assay
steps including bacteria capture, concentration, purification, partition,
and digital LAMP were integrated onto a piece of membrane without
the need for off-membrane sample treatments. This significantly reduces
potential sample loss and simplified the entire procedure. (iii) With
the modified assay, mLAMP could quantify bacteria at concentrations
down to 0.3 cells/mL in unprocessed environmental samples within 1
h, even though a relatively high level of inhibitors was present.
(iv) All experiments were performed on low-cost and disposable commercial
membranes without requiring elaborate chip fabrication or material
design. (v) No pump, vacuum, centrifuge, or other laboratory hardware
is required for field analysis.

We believe this simple membrane
system offers many promising opportunities
for laboratories, even without microfabrication facilities, to perform
digital quantification, single-cell analysis, and other biochemical
assays with high throughput. In the future, membranes could be directly
sealed by an adhesive film and imaged by a smartphone to increase
the system simplicity for point-of-care diagnostics.62,63 In addition, advanced micro/nanochannel membranes with novel functions
could also be integrated into the digital membrane system, like nanopore-based
DNA sequencing, DNA translocation, molecular exchange, cell electroporation,
or cell lysis.64 Furthermore, the asymmetric
membrane could be paired with paper-based analytical devices for complex
sample manipulation and detection.62,65 We believe
the heterogeneous membrane can serve as an ideal low-cost and simple
platform for the rapid detection and analysis of any markers in biological
samples, including nucleic acids, bacteria, circulating tumor cells,
stem cells, exosomes, viruses, and proteins.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
All LAMP reagents were purchased
from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA), and all primers were ordered
from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), unless otherwise
mentioned. Calcein, MnCl2, as well as acids were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Lysozyme, SYBR Green, and culture
media were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (San Jose, CA). Track-etched
PC membranes, PES membranes, and Nylon membranes were purchased from
Sterlitech Corporation (Kent, WA). Sylgard 184 silicon elastomer kit,
consisting of a prepolymer base and a curing agent, was obtained from
Dow Corning (Midland, MI).

Cell Culture
All bacterial strains
were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). E. coli (ATCC 10798) was cultivated in Luria–Bertani
broth in the shaking incubator for ∼14 h at 37 °C. Salmonella typhi (CVD 909) was cultivated in tryptic
soy broth with 1 mg/L of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate in the incubator for
∼14 h at 35 °C. The concentration of used bacteria suspensions
was measured by fluorescence enumeration or standard bacteria culture.
For fluorescence enumeration, a bacterial sample was first stained
with 1× SYBR Green for 30 min, followed by filtration through
a commercial PC membrane with a 0.2 μm pore size. The cell number
was then counted under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8). For
bacteria culture assays, bacteria concentrations were quantified by
spreading 20 μL of samples on corresponding agar plates, incubating
them for 12 h at the respective temperature, and counting the colony-forming
units (CFU). DNA extraction was performed using a commercial bead
beating tube (GeneRite, NJ, USA) or using the PureLink DNA extraction
kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following their instructions.

Preparation
of Asymmetric Membranes
To prepare the
asymmetric membrane, two symmetric track-etched PC membranes with
channel size sizes of 25 μm and 400 nm were stacked and then
placed on the top of a thin PDMS film, as illustrated in Figure S1. After being heated at 165 °C
on a hot plate for 1 min, these two membranes were irreversibly bonded
together. The PDMS films were used to prevent thermal deformation
of the membranes at high temperature. PDMS films were prepared by
mixing their precursor and curing agent in a ratio of 10:1 and heating
the mixture to 75 °C for 1.5 h.

Some commercial PC membranes
were coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). This hydrophilic coating
must be removed first because it affects the LAMP reaction. PVP removal
was accomplished by dipping membranes in 10% acetic acid for 60 min,
followed by heating to 120 °C for 30 min.66

LAMP Assay
The 25 μL of modified
LAMP mix for
digital single bacteria LAMP contained 1× isothermal buffer,
6 mM total MgSO4, 1.4 mM dNTP, 640 U/mL Bst 2.0 WarmStart polymerase, 1.6 μM FIB and BIP, 0.2 μM
F3 and B3, 0.8 μM LF and LB, 1.5 mg/mL BSA, 50 μM calcein,
1 mM MnCl2, 2 mM NaF, and 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme. For RT-LAMP,
WarmStart RTx reverse transcriptase was also added to a final concentration
of 300 U/mL. The primers for E. coli were designed to be specific to a conserved region on the malB gene,67 whereas primers for Salmonella were specific to gene marker STY1607.61 Their sequence is shown in the Supporting Information. Primer specificity has already been demonstrated and published.61,67 Thus, no selectivity tests (toward other bacteria) were conducted
in this study.

Digital Single Bacteria Detection on Membranes
The
asymmetric membrane with a sacrificial PC membrane (2 μm pore
size) on top was put into a commercial filter holder (Swinnex, Kent,
WA), and 1–10 mL of environmental sample with spiked bacteria
was filtered through it using a syringe pushed manually. After filtration,
the sacrificial prefilter membrane was thrown away, and 25 μL
of modified LAMP mix was added on the top of asymmetric membrane.
The wetted membrane was then sealed between two pieces of PDMS film.
Subsequently, the top PDMS was peeled off, followed by adding mineral
oil and a frame-seal (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to cover the whole membrane.
The membranes were incubated at 65 °C on a hot plate (MJ Research
PTC-100, Watertown, MA) for 40 min. After amplification, the fluorescence
images of the membrane were taken by a fluorescence microscope (Leica
DMi8) using a 4× objective. Positive pores were counted using
ImageJ (NIH) software and calibrated by Poisson distribution. The
total number of pores can also be counted using ImageJ because the
negative one also shows a weak fluorescence. However, in this study,
the total number of pores was simply estimated based on porosity (1
× 104 pores/cm2). Each sample was tested
at least three times.

For real-time LAMP performance in the
tube, the LAMP assay was premixed with 2.5 μL of seawater first
and incubated at 65 °C using an Eppendorf RealPlex2. Fluorescence
intensity of the reaction was monitored every minute for 60 min. For
conventional digital LAMP, the LAMP assay mixture (premixed with a
2.5 μL seawater sample) was loaded into each pore of the asymmetric
membrane and incubated at 65 °C for 40 min for digital LAMP analyses.

Environmental Samples
Seawater samples were collected
from the Santa Monica beach in California. Cultured E. coli samples were spiked with a final concentration
of 0.3 to 1 × 104 cells/mL and allowed to equilibrate
for 1 h before analysis. The turtle pond water was collected from
the turtle pond at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech),
and cultured Salmonella was spiked
in with a final concentration of 3 to 1 × 104 cells/mL.

Characterization
Top-view and cross-sectional view
SEM images were obtained with a ZEISS 1550VP field-emission scanning
electron microscope. Before analysis, samples were sputtered with
10 nm Pd. Wettability of the membrane was measured using a contact
angle goniometer equipped with an AmScope microscope camera model
MU300. A drop of LAMP mix was placed on the surface of the membranes.
After 10 s, the image was captured and then analyzed using ImageJ.

COMSOL Simulation
Finite element modeling was carried
out using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL Inc.,
Burlington, MA). In our simulations, the fluid flows were considered
as water with a density of 1 × 103 kg/m3 and a dynamic viscosity μ of 1 × 10–3 Pa·s. The fluid geometry during sample filtration was represented
by a 2D model. The fluid flow passing through the asymmetric membrane
was represented by two layers, each with a thickness of 25 μm
and diameter of 13 mm. The diameter and center-to-center distance
of the micropores in the upper layer were 25 and 225 μm, respectively.
The diameter and center-to-center distance of the nanochannels in
the bottom layer were 400 nm and 2 μm, respectively. The velocity
of fluid at the inlet was set to 0.0318 m/s. The steady-state laminar
flow profile throughout the fluid geometry was calculated first using
the Navier–Stokes equation. Subsequently, a fixed amount of
1 μm particles was placed at the sample inlet for calculations
of their trajectories using a particle tracing model. The density
of the particles was set to 1100 kg/m3, similar to that
of E. coli. The trajectories of the
particles were calculated, and thus the distribution of particles
along the membrane was measured.
