Understanding
cooling of hot charge carriers in semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) is of fundamental interest and useful to enhance the performance
of QDs in photovoltaics. We study electron and hole cooling dynamics
in PbSe QDs up to high energies where carrier multiplication occurs.
We characterize distinct cooling steps of hot electrons and holes
and build up a broadband cooling spectrum for both charge carriers.
Cooling of electrons is slower than of holes. At energies near the
band gap we find cooling times between successive electronic energy
levels in the order of 0.5 ps. We argue that here the large spacing
between successive electronic energy levels requires cooling to occur
by energy transfer to vibrational modes of ligand molecules or phonon
modes associated with the QD surface. At high excess energy the energy
loss rate of electrons is 1–5 eV/ps and exceeds 8 eV/ps for
holes. Here charge carrier cooling can be understood in terms of emission
of LO phonons with a higher density-of-states in the valence band
than the conduction band. The complete mapping of the broadband cooling
spectrum for both charge carriers in PbSe QDs is a big step toward
understanding and controlling the cooling of hot charge carriers in
colloidal QDs.

Colloidal
semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) are of interest because of the possibility of tuning their
optical and electronic properties by variation of composition and
size. In combination with their solution-processability this offers
promising prospects for application in devices such as field-effect
transistors, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and solar cells.1 PbSe QDs receive much attention due to their
exceptionally strong quantum confinement properties, and in particular
because of the occurrence of carrier multiplication (CM).2−6 CM is a process in which one sufficiently energetic photon excites
two or more electrons across the band gap. In this way the power conversion
efficiency of a solar cell can be enhanced above the Shockley–Queisser
limit. CM occurs in competition with cooling of initially energetic
electrons or holes via LO phonon emission or other relaxation channels.7−9

Until now, studies on charge carrier cooling in PbSe QDs involved
low photoexcitation energies close to the band gap.10−13 Here, the distance between adjacent
electronic energy levels is typically several LO phonon energies,
requiring simultaneous emission of multiple phonons for a charge carrier
to cool from one level to the one below. This is referred to as the
“phonon bottleneck” and was originally suggested to
increase the CM efficiency of nanocrystals over bulk.14,15 However, clear evidence of the phonon bottleneck has not been found
in PbSe QDs.12,16 Near the band edge other cooling
channels can become dominant, such as trapping at defects, energy
transfer to vibrational modes of ligand molecules, or surface related
phonon modes.13,17−21 In agreement with this, it was found that electron
cooling near the band edge in CdSe QDs is slowed down several orders
of magnitude by decoupling the electron from the surface, so that
it could relax only through emission of LO phonons.22,23

The competition between CM and other relaxation channels takes
place at higher energies where an electron or a hole has an excess
energy that is at least equal to the band gap. At such high excess
energy the electronic structure of PbSe QDs approaches that of bulk
PbSe and LO phonon emission will not be restricted by the availability
of electronic energy levels at a spacing equal to the phonon energy.
Currently, little is known of cooling at high charge carrier excess
energy, except that it is very fast.24−28 In addition, hot carrier cooling in QDs is usually
described as a single cooling time.12,29−31 We stress however that each transition of a charge carrier from
an energy level to a level of lower energy is a discrete quantum mechanical
transition with its own characteristic time constant. Hence carrier
cooling times are a function of energy and should ideally be described
by a cooling spectrum, separate for electrons and holes.

In
this work, we determine cooling times of charge carriers in
PbSe QDs between discrete electronic states near the band edge, and
at higher excess energy where the electronic states form a quasi-continuum
with a character close to that of bulk PbSe. We build up a broadband
cooling spectrum for both charge carriers and find that holes cool
faster than electrons, in agreement with our earlier work.32 Strikingly, we can resolve five discrete cooling
steps (three for electrons and two for holes) near the band edge before
the onset of the quasi-continuum. We argue that at lower energies
charge carrier cooling involves energy transfer to vibrational modes
associated with the surface of the QD. At high carrier excess energy
cooling can be explained in terms of emission of LO phonons, which
we verify by k·p calculations. We show that we expect an asymmetric density-of-states
(DOS) with a denser valence band than conduction band to account for
the differences in cooling times of electrons and holes.

Results and Discussion
Measurements
and Modeling of Electron and Hole Cooling Dynamics
PbSe QDs
with a diameter of 3.9 nm and band gap of 0.93 eV were
synthesized via the method by Steckel et al.,33 washed twice, and dispersed in toluene (see Methods). The QD dispersion was investigated using transient absorption
(TA) spectroscopy with a time resolution of ∼0.15 ps and a
probe spectral range of 375–1600 nm (see Methods). In all measurements discussed below the pump laser fluence was
sufficiently low that on average much less than one photon per QD
was absorbed (⟨Nabs⟩ <
0.15). We show in Figure 1a the hyperspectral TA image that results from photoexcitation
by a pump laser pulse with photon energy of 3.35 eV (370 nm), which
is high above the band gap. At this photoexcitation energy CM takes
place and Auger recombination of multiexcitons can be observed in
the first tens of picoseconds. After that only single cold excitons
are left and no further decay is observed in the considered time window
of 2.5 ns, since the single exciton lifetime in PbSe QDs is several
hundreds of nanoseconds.13,34 The main aim of this
work is to study charge carrier cooling, which can be observed in
the first few picoseconds after photoexcitation. To highlight the
spectral features of charge carrier cooling, we show spectral slices
at short (averaged 0.5–1.0 ps) and long (averaged 0.5–2.5
ns) pump–probe delay in Figure 1b, together with the ground-state absorption spectrum.
Vertical dashed lines are added to indicate the position of several
optical transitions as identified in the past (labeled S for the 1Se–1Sh transition, P for 1Ph–1Pe, D for 1Dh–1De, and Σ
for quantum confined transitions around the Σ-point in the bulk
Brillouin Zone).35

0.5–1.0 ps) and long (averaged 0.5–2.5 ns) pump–probe
delay, together with the ground-state absorption spectrum and vertical
dashed lines to indicate several optical transitions.

The spectral features at long pump–probe
delay in Figure 1b
are due to single
cold 1Sh–1Se excitons, as discussed in
our previous work.32 The negative TA signal
near 1330 nm is due to ground state bleaching and stimulated emission
resulting from 1Sh–1Se excitons. The
negative TA signal at 400–500 nm results from blocking of transitions
to the second conduction or valence band by the presence of either
a hole in the valence band (1Sh) or an electron in the
conduction band (1Se).32 Between
these bleach features, the transient absorption spectrum is caused
by a red-shift of the ground-state absorption spectrum due to biexciton
interactions and possible intraband absorption.36

The negative TA signals are very different at short
pump–probe
delay when hot excitons are cooling down to the band edge. The band
edge bleach is already present, but accompanied by a photoinduced
absorption (PA) signal below the band gap. Moreover, a PA contribution
shifts the TA signal at 400–500 nm toward positive values.
These PA signals result from biexciton interactions caused by hot
excitons and largely disappear when cooling has completed.37,38

In literature, charge carrier cooling is often studied by
considering
single wavelength TA signals at the 1Sh–1Se and 1Ph–1Pe transitions.12,13,22,26,39 This however does not take into account
the PA signal caused by biexciton interactions near these transitions.29,40,41 As cooling takes place, the PA
signal decreases and the band edge bleach increases, since fewer hot
excitons are present and more excitons have arrived at the band edge.
To quantitatively describe the band edge bleach while correcting for
biexciton interactions, one can either fit or integrate.29,40 We choose here to fit because it alleviates problems with a coherent
artifact and boundaries, but we show in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information that identical results
can be obtained. We first fit a Gaussian function to the 1Sh–1Se transition peak in the ground-state absorption
spectrum A as a function of photon energy. We then
assume that the bleach of the transition is directly proportional
to the number of 1Sh–1Se excitons present.
The corresponding absorption peak of the excited state absorption
spectrum A* at time t after the
pump laser pulse is then given by 1  where the parameters C, E0, and σ are obtained
from the Gaussian fit to the ground-state absorption spectrum. The
function f(t) is the sum of the
fraction of QDs containing a hole in the 1Sh valence band
state and the fraction of QDs containing an electron in the 1Se conduction band state and is therefore a measure of the bleach
at the band edge. The parameter δE(t) is the time-dependent shift in energy of the 1Sh–1Se transition of a photoexcited QD. As was discussed
in literature this shift in energy and the function f(t) can be determined independently.29,36 The shift δE(t) is largest
for hot excitons that are present on short time scales and decreases
to a constant when all excitons have cooled down to the band edge.
The factor 3/4 brings into account the 8-fold
degeneracy of the 1Sh and 1Se states and the
fact that the bleach results from both reduced absorption and stimulated
emission.13,29,40,42Equation 1 can be rearranged to obtain the TA signal around the band edge bleach,
which is given by 2  Fitting eq 2 to the
TA spectrum at each pump–probe delay
yields the time-dependent function f(t). Note that when CM occurs the presence of two or more excitons
in some QDs is included in the value of f(t).

Fits of eq 2 to the
TA spectrum of Figure 1 around the 1Sh–1Se transition for short
and long pump–probe delay are shown in Figure 2a. The fits reproduce the bleach of the 1Sh–1Se transition and are truncated at the
high-energy side to avoid effects of higher energy transitions that
are not included in eq 2. The red curve in Figure 2b shows the time-dependent function f(t) obtained from the fit, as well as exponential fits to
describe f(t) as discussed below.
The uncertainty in the fit of eq 2 at a particular pump–probe delay gives rise to noise
in the function f(t) of approximately
10%.

and long pump–probe delay, together with fits of eq 2. (b) The function f(t) obtained from fitting eq 2 to the experimental data, as well as exponential
fits to describe f(t) as discussed
in the text.

In previous studies a
single exponential function (of the form
1 – e–kt, which is characteristic
for a first order decay process) has been used to describe cooling
of hot charge carriers to the band edge states.12,29−31 As can be seen in Figure 2b, a fit of such a single exponential function
does not reproduce f(t). This is
not surprising, because we previously found that holes cool much faster
than electrons and therefore a sum of at least two exponential functions
would be needed.32 However, we show in Figure 2b that a double exponential
function does not reproduce f(t)
either. Rather, the “S-like” shape of f(t) indicates that cooling of electrons and holes
to the band edge states takes place in several sequential steps. Thus,
a model to describe f(t) must include
successive cooling steps of charge carriers from higher energy levels
to the band edge states.39 In the next
paragraph we discuss the analysis of our experimental data on the
basis of such a kinetic model for electron and hole cooling in PbSe
QDs.

Determination of Electron and Hole Cooling Times between Successive
Energy Levels
We can describe charge carrier cooling as a
sequence of steps between successive electronic energy levels as schematically
shown in Figure 3a.
The time-dependent population of the different electronic states can
be described by kinetic equations for relaxation of the electron and
the hole, given by 3a   3b  with Ni,e the population of electrons
in level ei and Ni,h the
population of holes in level hi. The function f(t) as shown in Figure 2b can then be described as 3c  with Ae (Ah) the relative contribution of electrons
(holes)
to f(t) and therefore to the bleach
at the band edge.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic model of the PbSe QD electronic structure
with cooling
time constants for transitions between successive energy levels. (b–e)
Fits of eq 3 to measured
data for f(t) for photoexcitation
energies and transitions as indicated, which are just above the threshold
at which a new level and cooling time had to be included in eq 3.

We obtain the time constants (τi,e, τi,h) for the different
cooling
steps by fitting eq 3 to experimental data for f(t),
such as those shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, while increasing the photoexcitation energy in small steps. For
multiple photoexcitation energies we find that the time constants
for specific transitions remain unchanged. Whenever the set of coupled
rate equations requires the time constants to change in order to describe f(t) accurately, we fix the time constants
obtained thus far and add a next hole and electron level. We stop
adding more discrete energy levels in the case where the time constant
remains within the experimental time resolution of ∼0.15 ps
or increases continuously with photoexcitation energy. From that energy
we consider the electronic structure of the PbSe QDs to resemble a
quasi-continuum. In Figure 3 panels b–e we show f(t) with fits for photoexcitation energies just above successive thresholds
at which a new energy level had to be included in eq 3. These photoexcitation energies
coincide with the transitions in the ground-state absorption spectrum
in Figure 1.

When photoexciting at 1.15 eV (resonant with the 1Ph–1Pe transition) we can reproduce the measured f(t) by including one cooling step for
the electron (from level e1 to e0) and one for
the hole (from level h1 to h0) in eq 3, see Figure 3b. This results in a double exponential function
of which one exponential describes the first electron cooling step
(with cooling time τ1,e from e1 to e0) and the other the analogous first hole cooling step. We
distinguish between electron and hole, as described in the next paragraph.
The measured f(t) in Figure 3c for photoexcitation at 1.55
eV can only be reproduced by adding a second cooling step for the
electron and hole, while the first cooling times τ1,e and τ1,h are kept fixed to the value obtained for
lower photoexcitation energies. We continue with this procedure until
we no longer find discrete cooling steps between energy levels. For
electrons we find that τ4,e increases continuously
with photoexcitation energy. Instead of defining a new energy level
for each photoexcitation energy, we consider the electronic structure
above the fourth electronic energy level (e4) to approach
a quasi-continuum. For holes we find that τ3,h and
higher are much smaller than our time resolution, and we therefore
consider the electronic structure for holes to approach a quasi-continuum
above the third electronic energy level (h3). The cooling
times determined from the procedure described above are given between
the corresponding energy levels in Figure 3a. We note that in our data, we have a rise
time of f(t) due to the pulse width
of our laser. In Figure S2 of the Supporting Information we show f(t) for band edge excitation
where cooling is absent and determine an experimental time resolution
of 0.15 ps from the rise time. The cooling time constants we list
in Figure 3 are convolved
with this time resolution.

We attributed cooling times to electrons
or holes by making use
of the high energy L4–6 and L5–7 transitions studied in our previous work that are visible as bleach
features at 400–500 nm in Figure 1.32 These are
transitions from the second valence band to the first conduction band
(L4–6, 2.7 eV) and from the first valence band to
the second conduction band (L5–7, 2.5 eV). These
transitions are selectively sensitive either to the 1Se electron (L4–6) or the 1Sh hole (L5–7) at the band edge, when photoexciting with energy
lower than these transition energies. In Figure 4a we show f(t) for 1.77 eV (700 nm) photoexcitation together with the fit of eq 3 to f(t). For the same photoexcitation energy we show
a separate electron and hole bleach transient as determined from the
L4–6 and L5–7 transitions in Figure 4b. The black curves
in Figure 4b are the
separate contributions of eq 3c due to electrons (AeN0,e(t)) or holes (AhN0,h(t)) as obtained from the fit of eq 3 to f(t) in Figure 4a. As
can be observed, the L4–6 bleach due to 1Se electrons is very well described by one set of cooling times. Likewise
the L5–7 bleach due to 1Sh holes is properly
described by the other set of cooling times. Therefore, we can safely
ascribe each set of cooling times to the corresponding charge carrier.
We observe that electrons cool slower than holes in agreement with
our previous work.32

of 3.9 nm PbSe QDs. (b) Separate electron and hole bleach as determined
from the high energy L4–6 (2.7 eV) and L5–7 (2.5 eV) transitions described by the electron (L4–6) and hole (L5–7) contributions in eq 3c.

Equation 3c also
yields the relative contribution Ae/Ah to f(t)
of electrons and holes. We show Ae/Ah as a function of photoexcitation energy in
Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. We find that Ae/Ah is approximately 1.2 for all photoexcitation energies up
to 2.1 eV, comparable to the relative contribution of electrons and
holes to the band edge bleach as determined in our previous work using
an electron scavenging molecule.32 For
photoexcitation energies exceeding 2.1 eV however, Ae/Ah increases to values up
to 3. We believe that our model shown in Figure 3a is no longer valid at higher photoexcitation
energy due to additional relaxation pathways for electrons and holes
such as CM and the simultaneous excitation of various electron and
hole states at different points in the band structure (e.g., with
Σ or W character). We therefore no longer assign electrons and
holes to the two contributions, but rather realize that we have a
slow and a fast cooling component that consists of both electrons
and holes. We point out that this happens above 2.1 eV photoexcitation
energy where our results suggest that the electronic structures of
both electrons and holes approach a quasi-continuum. The constant
cooling times found between energy levels near the band edge remain
valid.

The procedure described above yields the time constants
for electron
and hole cooling steps between successive discrete energy levels,
as well as the cooling times from energies in the quasi-continuum
to the highest discrete energy level that is distinguished. Taken
together this constitutes a broadband cooling spectrum as shown in
the upper panel of Figure 5. We also indicate the position of the optical transitions,
as determined from the absorption spectrum in the lower panel of Figure 5 and include electron
and hole cooling times as obtained from the L4–6 and L5–7 transitions, which agree with the data
resulting from fitting eq 3 to f(t).

Figure 5 Broadband cooling spectrum
for 3.9 nm PbSe QDs for electrons (filled
symbols) and holes (open symbols). The optical absorption spectrum
with its second derivative is included to obtain the position of the
optical transitions, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines. Data
from the L4–6 and L5–7 transitions
allow us to attribute cooling times to electrons or holes.

Figure 5 shows that
the 1P–1S cooling times for electrons and holes are discrete
and fully account for cooling up to hν ≈ 1.4 eV. At that point discrete 1D–1P cooling channels
become available, followed by Σ–1D channels at hν ≈ 1.9 eV. From that point
on the cooling times increase continuously as the density-of-states
(DOS) forms a quasi-continuum. Figure 5 further shows that each individual hole cooling step
is faster than the corresponding step for an electron. This agrees
with our earlier finding that the total cooling time from high energy
down to the band edge is shorter for a hole than for an electron.32 A second finding is the decrease of both the
electron and hole cooling time constants on going from the lowest
energy transition to higher transitions. The electron cooling time
constants for transitions between discrete levels decrease slightly
with energy but remain in the same order of magnitude of ∼0.5
ps. The hole cooling time constant for the first transition is slightly
smaller than that for the electron. Interestingly, the hole cooling
time constants for the next transitions are significantly shorter
than the corresponding electron cooling time constants and have values
within the ∼0.15 ps time resolution of our experiment.

Factors
Governing Electron and Hole Cooling Times
According
to calculations in the literature, emission of LO phonons mediates
charge carrier cooling in PbSe QDs at high excess energy.11,16,43 The energy of LO phonons in PbSe
is ∼17 meV and the typical time of one LO phonon emission event
in bulk PbSe is ∼25 fs.43 For large
charge carrier excess energy, the quasi-continuum of electronic states
will contain levels with spacing (nearly) equal to an LO phonon energy
and charge cooling via LO phonon emission can be efficient. However,
for the lowest cooling steps near the band gap the energy difference
between the discrete electronic states (>100 meV) is much larger
than
the LO phonon energy. To overcome these large electronic energy differences,
each cooling step would require simultaneous emission of multiple
LO phonons. Theoretical calculations show that this is very unlikely
and would lead to cooling times in the order of nanoseconds, which
is orders of magnitude longer than our findings.44

In addition to LO phonon emission, charge carrier
cooling can be facilitated by energy transfer to vibrational modes
of the oleate ligands. In agreement with the latter it was found for
CdSe QDs that ligands have a large influence on charge carrier cooling.22,23 In Figure S4 of the Supporting Information we show an FTIR spectrum of our PbSe QDs with oleate ligands, revealing
oleate vibrational modes in the energy range of 100–200 meV
and near 350 meV (corresponding to the carbonyl stretch vibration
and CH stretch vibrations in the aliphatic chain, respectively). We
also show electronic transition energies as obtained from the optical
absorption spectrum that overlap with the ligand vibration energies.
Hence, energy transfer to ligand vibrational modes can facilitate
charge carrier cooling near the band edge. Beside ligand vibrational
modes, the surface of QDs also enables other strong phonon interactions
that could assist charge carrier cooling.19

The above considerations do not explain why holes cool much
faster
than electrons. To gain more insight into carrier relaxation by LO
phonon emission we calculate the PbSe bulk band structure and QD electronic
structure using a k·p Hamiltonian with states around both the L-point
and the Σ-point in the first Brillouin Zone of the rock-salt
lattice.45−48 We parametrize this Hamiltonian using ab initio DFT to solve the Kohn–Sham equation for bulk PbSe in the
CASTEP plane waves based parallel DFT code.49,50 We use the TB-mBJ exchange potential with treatment of spin–orbit
interactions at the scalar (or vector, see Supporting Information) relativistic level (see Methods).51 We show the calculated bulk band
structure including a schematic QD electronic structure to incorporate
our experimental cooling time constants in Figure 6. In Figure S5 of the Supporting Information we include a comparison of the calculated
QD electronic structure with treatment of spin–orbit interactions
both at the scalar and vector relativistic level showing the same
qualitative behavior.

Figure 6 PbSe bulk band structure (left) and schematic PbSe QD
electronic
structure (right) including our experimental cooling time constants.

From Figure 6 and
Figure S5 of the Supporting Information we observe that the first electronic energy levels in the QDs in
the conduction band arise predominantly from the bulk L-point, followed
by energy levels that also have Σ-point character. This gives
rise to a quasi-continuum. In the valence band the Σ-point is
mixed into the QD electronic structure at much lower energy, resulting
in a much lower onset of the quasi-continuum. As first suggested by
Zunger et al.,52 this is caused by the
smaller energy difference between the L and Σ extrema in the
valence band than in the conduction band, which is also evident in Figure 6. The result is a
higher DOS in the valence band than in the conduction band, in line
with previous results from Zunger52 and
Liljeroth,53 resulting in faster hole cooling
rates. These observations agree very well with the experimental cooling
time constants and corresponding optical transitions in Figure 5.

To describe charge
carrier cooling in the quasi-continuum, the
energy loss rate γ of electrons and holes at high excess energy
above the first Σ-point level can be obtained from the experiments
using 4  where τ is the cooling time and hν is the photoexcitation energy.
If it is assumed that the photon energy in excess of the band gap
is equally distributed over the electron and the hole (admittedly
a strong simplification considering the discussion above), the data
in Figure 5 yield an
energy loss rate for the electron of 1 eV/ps at low energy, increasing
to 5 eV/ps at high energy. This seems reasonable considering previous
calculations.11,16,43 The hole cooling time is faster than the ∼0.15 ps experimental
time resolution, leading to an energy loss rate of at least 8 eV/ps
even near the bottom of the quasi-continuum. This very high energy
loss rate for holes could be due to additional relaxation pathways
such as CM not considered in eq 3. In addition, an asymmetric division of the energy
between electron and hole due to the difference in DOS puts most energy
in the electron, enhancing the apparent difference in energy loss
rates. When photoexcitation occurs via the L4–6 or
the L5–7 transition,32 all excess energy is transferred either to the hole or the electron
and a very asymmetric division of energy is achieved. These effects
occur above the Σ-point transition in the quasi-continuum and
do not affect the cooling time constants we find between discrete
energy levels near the band edge.

If charge carrier cooling
in the quasi-continuum occurs solely
due to emission of LO phonons with an energy of ∼17 meV,11,16,43 the energy loss rate for electrons
of 1–5 eV/ps leads to a net LO phonon emission time of 3.4–17
fs. Likewise the energy loss rate for holes of at least 8 eV/ps leads
to a net LO phonon emission time <2.1 fs. Using the calculated
electronic states from Figure S5, we can
describe carrier relaxation in PbSe QDs through emission of LO phonons
with the Wigner–Weisskopf description in the strong coupling
regime (see Methods).54 We assume LO phonon decay through the Ridley LO → TO + TA
channel due to the large anharmonicity of LO phonons in the rock-salt
structure (see Methods).55−57 We find the
shortest LO phonon emission time for resonance of the transition energy
with the LO phonon energy of 17 meV. This emission time is 3.6 fs
and agrees well with our experimental energy loss rates mentioned
above.

Conclusions
We identify five discrete
cooling steps (three for electrons and
two for holes) before the onset of a continuously increasing cooling
time in PbSe QDs. The cooling time constants for both electrons and
holes between discrete electronic states close to the band edge are
of the order of 0.5 ps and require energy transfer to surface ligand
vibrational modes or surface phonon modes. At high excess energy electrons
and holes cool via emission of LO phonons due to the convergence of
the electronic structure to a quasi-continuum. There the experimental
energy loss rate is 1–5 eV/ps for electrons and at least 8
eV/ps for holes. These results agree well with theoretical carrier
relaxation results. We find the start of the quasi-continuum for holes
much closer to the band edge than for electrons and therefore confirm
an asymmetric density-of-states for PbSe QDs. The results constitute
the first broadband cooling spectrum for electrons and holes in colloidal
nanocrystals.

Methods
Synthesis of
PbSe QDs
PbSe QDs with a diameter of 3.9
nm were synthesized using the method described by Steckel et al.33 In brief, 4.77 g of lead acetate trihydrate
(99.999%, Aldrich), 3.42 g of oleic acid (90%, Aldrich) and 13.14
g of 1-octadecene (90%, Aldrich) were placed into a flask and dried
and reacted under vacuum for at least 2 h at 120 °C. A second
mixture containing 1.12 g of selenium (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), 0.13
mL of diphenylphospine (98%, Aldrich), and 14.87 mL of trioctylphosphine
(90%, Fluka) was prepared. Subsequently, the lead mixture was heated
to 180 °C under nitrogen and the selenium mixture was injected.
The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 s at 150 °C after
which the reaction was quenched using 15 mL of butanol (99.8 anhydrous,
Aldrich). The crude synthesis mixtures were washed twice by precipitating
with methanol, centrifugation, and redispersion of the sediment in
toluene. This resulted in particles with a diameter of 3.9 ±
0.3 nm as determined by TEM.

Hyperspectral TA Spectroscopy
We
studied charge carrier
cooling in PbSe QDs using broadband optical pump–probe spectroscopy.
The QD samples were dispersed in toluene in a 2 mm stirred quartz
cuvette at a typical optical density of 0.05 at the band gap. The
QD dispersion was stirred during TA experiments to prevent photocharging.

Femtosecond laser pulses were generated in a Yb:KGW oscillator
(Light Conversion, Pharos SP) at 1028 nm and amplified. A small fraction
of the 1028 nm fundamental beam was split off to generate the broadband
probe spectrum in a sapphire (500–1600 nm) or CaF2 (375–600 nm) crystal. The probe pulse was delayed up to 2.5
ns using an automated delay stage. The majority of the 1028 nm fundamental
beam was used as a pump pulse after nonlinear frequency mixing in
an OPA and second harmonics module (Light Conversion, Orpheus) to
achieve wavelengths of 310–1330 nm. The pump and probe pulses
overlap on the sample position under an angle of ∼8 degrees,
after which the pump pulse is dumped and the probe light is led to
a detector suitable for the probe spectrum selected (Ultrafast Systems,
Helios). We calculate the pump-induced change in absorption according
to 5  with I0 the intensity
of the probe beam incident on the sample and Ion and Ioff the intensity of the
probe beam transmitted through the sample with the pump beam either
on or off. All shown data is corrected for dispersion by fitting a
polynomial function to the solvent response. The time resolution of
the TA measurements is determined by the rise time of the TA signal
at band edge excitation as shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information and is 0.15 ps.

In all experiments
the laser pump fluence was taken sufficiently
low to prevent multiple photons being absorbed in a single QD. Assuming
Poissonian statistics for photoexcitation, the probability PN for a QD to absorb N photons is given by 6  with the average number
of photons absorbed
per QD equal to ⟨Nabs⟩ = Jσ where J is the laser pump fluence
and σ is the photon absorption cross section. During the measurements
we take J low enough, so that PN≥2 is negligible, that is, ⟨Nabs⟩ < 0.15, and PN≥2 = 1 – P0 – P1 = 0.01.

Electronic
Structure Calculations
We calculate the
electronic structure of PbSe QDs using a k·p Hamiltonian with states around
the L-point in the first Brillouin zone of the rock-salt lattice,45−48 augmented with states around the Σ-point. This Hamiltonian
is parametrized using ab initio DFT (without fitting
the band structure) to solve the Kohn–Sham equation in the
CASTEP plane waves based parallel DFT code.49,50 Many electron effects are approximated using the Tran-Blaha (TB-mBJ)
exchange correlation functional as implemented in CASTEP.47,51 Spin–orbit effects are taken into account at the scalar (vector)
relativistic level. For parametrization of the k·p Hamiltonian we use
the room temperature value of the effective masses at the L-point,
while at the Σ-point we use those obtained from DFT.58 This leads to good agreement between the experimental
(∼110 meV if assumed equal for electron and hole) and theoretical
(147 meV) 1Pe–1Se transition. We find
that the energetic difference between the top of the valence band
at the Σ-point and the top of the valence band at the L-point
is much smaller than the energetic difference between the corresponding
band extrema in the conduction band. This results in a higher density-of-states
in the valence band. Energy gaps and effective masses are given in
the Supporting Information.

Electron–Phonon
Scattering Calculations
To describe
charge carrier cooling by the emission of LO phonons, we follow the
Wigner–Weisskopf description in the strong coupling regime.
This allows us to couple electrons to the LO phonon when the energy
between electronic energy levels is not resonant with the LO phonon
energy. We can then calculate the phonon emission rate by54 7  Here Δif = Ei – Ef ±
ℏωLO is the detuning of the LO phonon energy
ℏωLO from the difference in energy between
the initial and final electronic energy levels Ei and Ef, Wph is the phenomenological rate of LO phonon decay into two
less energetic phonons due to anharmonicity and gif is the coupling strength of an electron to the LO phonon.
Assuming the Fröhlich interaction for coupling between electrons
and LO phonons gif is given by 8  where nLO is the
phonon occupation number, Fif(q) = ⟨i|eiqr|f⟩
is the electron–phonon coupling matrix element, and q is the phonon momentum vector. We take care of momentum
conservation through  with  ∼ 0.544 Å–1 while calculating τifph according to eqs 7 and 8. We assume that
the Ridley LO → TO + TA channel is the most dominant LO phonon
decay channel, significantly faster than any other channel such as
Klemens or Vallee-Bogani,55−57 due to the large Grüneisen
parameter of the TO mode in PbSe, γ(TO) = 15.59 For this channel we estimate Wph ∼ 277 ps–1 at room temperature.
