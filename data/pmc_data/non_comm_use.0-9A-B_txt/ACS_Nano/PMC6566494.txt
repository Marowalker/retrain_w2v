The ongoing quest
to develop single-particle methods for the in situ study of heterogeneous catalysts is driven by the
fact that heterogeneity in terms of size, shape, grain structure,
and composition is a general feature among nanoparticles in an ensemble.
This heterogeneity hampers the generation of a deeper understanding
for how these parameters affect catalytic properties. Here we present
a solution that in a single benchtop experimental setup combines single-particle
plasmonic nanospectroscopy with mass spectrometry for gas phase catalysis
under reaction conditions at high temperature. We measure changes
in the surface state of polycrystalline platinum model catalyst particles
in the 70 nm size range and the corresponding bistable kinetics during
the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction via the peak
shift of the dark-field scattering spectrum of a closely adjacent
plasmonic nanoantenna sensor and compare these changes with the total
reaction rate measured by the mass spectrometer from an ensemble of
nominally identical particles. We find that the reaction kinetics
of simultaneously measured individual Pt model catalysts are dictated
by the grain structure and that the superposition of the individual
nanoparticle response can account for the significant broadening observed
in the corresponding nanoparticle ensemble data. In a wider perspective
our work enables in situ plasmonic nanospectroscopy
in controlled gas environments at high temperature to investigate
the role of the surface state on transition metal catalysts during
reaction and of processes such as alloying or surface segregation in situ at the single-nanoparticle level for model catalysts
in the few tens to hundreds of nanometer size range.

Studying
individual nanoparticles
is of high relevance in heterogeneous catalysis,1−4 where they are widely used and
where polydispersity in terms of size, shape, and grain structure
is a general feature among them. This heterogeneity hampers the generation
of a deeper understanding for how these structural parameters affect
catalytic activity since they, together with electronic and spillover
interactions with the support,5−8 directly control the catalytic performance. Assessing
the state, activity, and selectivity of individual nanoparticles thus
has significant potential to contribute to the development of efficient
catalyst materials. Therefore, the characterization of single nanoparticles
at in situ conditions is a major tour de force in
catalysis, and significant efforts are invested in the development
of the required experimental techniques.

To this end, plasmonic
nanospectroscopy is an experimental concept
that employs metal nanoparticles capable of manipulating light at
the nanoscale, via electron oscillations known as
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).9−11 Such plasmonic
nanoantennas have been successfully used as nanoscopic probes of various
processes including phase transitions,11 biomolecule interactions and sensing,12−14 metal hydride formation,15 gas- and chemosensing,10,16 and catalytic reactions.17−21 In catalysis applications they can report directly on the catalyst
nanoparticle surface or bulk state due to the intrinsically very high
sensitivity of LSPR to surface and bulk changes.11 One of the most appealing assets of the plasmonic nanospectroscopy
concept, when projected onto catalysis research, is the possibility
to address individual nanoparticles in the 10–100s
nm size regime, which is accessible to the enhanced precision of top-down
nanofabrication that enables the preparation of controlled and precisely
tunable model systems.4,22−25 Notably, this single-nanoparticle
resolution comes without principle restrictions on the surrounding
medium; that is, both liquid and gas phase environments are accessible
at ambient pressure or above.6,13,19,26−31 Moreover, multiple individual nanoparticles can be addressed simultaneously
using concepts such as hyperspectral imaging and derivatives.32−35 This potentially offers similar insights as recently obtained by in situ X-ray absorption spectromicroscopy at a beamline4,7 but with benchtop optical microscopy instrumentation for optical
dark-field scattering spectroscopy.36

To date, the plasmonic nanospectroscopy concept has been successfully
applied to study catalytic processes at the single-particle level
at in situ conditions in the liquid phase, as introduced
in the seminal paper by Novo etal.19 Subsequent studies by various groups
further diversified the concept37 to, for
instance, investigate the photocatalytic decomposition of lactic acid,31 Au nanoparticle-catalyzed redox reactions between
glucose and O2,38 hydrogenation
of chemisorbed 4-NTP,39 electron transfer
rates from different nanoparticle facets,40 spectroelectrochemistry,41 and spillover
effects to an oxide support.6 However,
while elegantly demonstrating the single-particle capabilities of
plasmonic nanospectroscopy in catalysis, all these studies have been
carried out in the liquid phase and at or close to room temperature.
Thus, they leave unaddressed the important field of gas phase heterogeneous
catalysis, which typically takes place at several hundred Kelvin at
atmospheric pressure or above. Furthermore, all these investigations
have in common that they solely rely on the plasmonic signal, that
is, the spectral shift of the resonance peak as the readout. In other
words, only the state of the catalyst nanoparticle itself (e.g., charge or oxidation state)19,40 or of the surrounding medium (e.g., via spillover)6 is
reported, while the reaction products remain unanalyzed.

As
a first step toward overcoming these limitations, we report
an experimental concept and the corresponding setup that combines in situ single-particle plasmonic nanospectroscopy of catalyst
nanoparticles with a gas phase catalytic flow reactor operating at
up to 623 K and equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS)
for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of reaction products from
an adjacent ensemble (on the order of 109 particles) of
nominally identical nanoparticles prepared by nanofabrication (Figure 1). This design enables
the direct investigation of ensemble averaging effects in a single
experiment since individual nanoparticles (LSPR) and a corresponding
ensemble (QMS) can be probed simultaneously in the same experiment.
To this end, we also note that for the detection of bioanalytes in
the liquid phase both SPR42 and LSPR43 sensing setups have been combined with mass
spectrometry, however, not simultaneously as done here.

Figure 1 Overview of
the setup that is centered on a flow-reactor tube made
from glass. To enable dark-field scattering spectroscopy, the reactor
tube is equipped with a flat 200 μm thick optical window. The
flow reactor arrangement is mounted on the sample stage of an upright
optical microscope. It is connected to a spectrometer equipped with
a CCD camera to collect scattered light from (individual) catalyst
nanostructures via a long-working-distance 50×
dark-field objective and epi-illumination. It is also equipped with
a gas inlet connected to mass-flow controllers for accurate control
of reactant concentration and reactant flow. The quadrupole mass spectrometer
(QMS) is mounted on a high-vacuum chamber that is connected to the
flow reactor chamber via a stainless steel tube.
To enable the QMS readout directly from the close vicinity of the
nanofabricated sample surface, we use a glass capillary “sniffer”
mounted inside the flow reactor. It acts as orifice leak and has a
∼5 μm opening. Its position can be accurately controlled via an x–y–z micrometer stage. To control sample temperature, the system
is internally equipped with a flat ceramic carbon heater that serves
as the sample holder for the nanofabricated model catalyst.

As the second step we introduce
a Au@SiO2–Pt
nanostructure design according to the indirect nanoplasmonic sensing17,44 scheme, where a nanofabricated single Au plasmonic antenna observer,
which is completely encapsulated in SiO2 and closely adjacent
to the active single Pt catalyst nanoparticle, boosts the total light-scattering
signal of the structure and serves as optical transducer in the plasmonic
nanospectroscopy single-nanoparticle readout. This arrangement is
necessary since most of the transition metal catalysts are poor light
scatterers,45 and it has the potential
to enable studies of individual catalyst particles in the sub-10 nm
size regime most relevant to industrial catalysis.28,46,47 Here, we use nanofabricated ∼20 ×
70 nm polycrystalline Pt nanoparticles as our model
system to deliberately create sizable particle heterogeneity in terms
of grain structure, defects, and surface faceting to demonstrate how
such parameters impact reaction kinetics at the single-nanoparticle
level.

As the third step and to demonstrate and benchmark our
setup using
these Au@SiO2–Pt structures, we investigated the
kinetic phase transition phenomenon and the corresponding bistable
kinetics that have been reported for the carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation
reaction both on single-crystal surfaces48 and on nanofabricated Pt model catalysts.22,48,49 As the main results obtained at atmospheric
pressure conditions, we found that the reaction kinetics of simultaneously
measured individual model catalyst nanoparticles are remarkably different
and critically depend on their grain structure in terms of abundance
of grains and of the corresponding surface faceting and that the superposition
of the individual nanoparticle response can account for the significant
broadening observed in the corresponding nanoparticle ensemble data.

Results
and Discussion
Our experimental setup (Figure 1; for a more technical drawing refer to Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, SI)
comprises an upright optical microscope operated in dark-field epi-illumination
mode. It is connected to a spectrometer equipped with a CCD camera,
which is used to collect scattered light from (individual) plasmonic
nanostructures via a long working-distance 50×
objective and thus enables both ensemble and single-particle plasmonic
nanospectroscopy readout from a tailor-made catalytic reactor described
below. Plasmonic nanospectroscopy relies on the fact that the LSPR
frequency of a metal nanoparticle is very sensitive to minute changes
on its surface or on a second nanoparticle in its close vicinity.13,17,28,29 Using dark-field scattering spectroscopy, the induced change in
LSPR frequency can be efficiently detected as a spectral shift of
the peak maximum in the light-scattering spectrum of a single nanoparticle,
with resolution high enough to detect single molecules.35 In our setup focusing on catalysis applications,
the nanofabricated plasmonic/catalytic sample is mounted on an inert
flat ceramic carbon heater installed inside a glass flow reactor tube
with 400 mm diameter, which we have equipped with a 1 in., 200 μm
thin flat optical window to facilitate dark-field scattering spectroscopy
readout from inside the reactor. It is also equipped with a gas inlet
connected to mass-flow controllers for accurate control of reactant
concentration. An active feedback loop controls the temperature of
the sample up to 623 K via a thermocouple and a temperature
controller. To facilitate the QMS readout directly from the nanofabricated
sample surface, we use a glass capillary “sniffer”,50 which is mounted inside the flow reactor. Its
position can be accurately controlled via an x–y–z micrometer
stage connected to the reactor by a stainless steel bellow. Via a stainless steel tube, the sniffer is further connected
to a UHV chamber, on which the QMS is mounted. The opening of the
glass capillary sniffer toward the sample is tuned to 5 μm using
the method introduced by Kasemo.50 In this
way it effectively acts as orifice leak for local, fast-response gas
sampling using the QMS by ensuring the necessary pressure drop from
1 atm inside the reactor to below the maximal operation pressure of
the QMS, which is on the order of 10–6 mbar.

To initially validate the function of the setup, we benchmarked
it with our earlier work on the kinetic phase transition that occurs
during the hydrogen oxidation reaction over a Pt nanoparticle ensemble model catalyst due to bistable kinetics, which
we had studied when introducing the indirect nanoplasmonic sensing
concept.17 The corresponding analysis of
a very similar set of experiments using our combined plasmonic nanospectroscopy
and QMS setup presented here is summarized and discussed in detail
in the SI and Figures S2 and S3. As the
first key result, it reproduces the insights obtained in our previous
study using a traditional quartz-tube flow reactor setup and simple
optical transmittance measurements.17 As
the second key result, it demonstrates the anticipated complementarity
of the optical and the QMS signals, that is, that the QMS reports
the catalyst activity of the nanofabricated model catalyst ensemble
and that the plasmonic nanospectroscopy optical signal directly reports
the catalyst surface state, as identified by the observed coincidence
of the highest reaction rate and change of the catalyst surface state
at the kinetic phase transition (Figure S2c).

To enable single-particle plasmonic nanospectroscopy from
a Pt
model catalyst, which by itself is a weak light scatterer,45 we want to place it closely adjacent to an inert
plasmonic nanoanetanna “observer” in order to enhance
the total scattering cross-section of the system. However, in contrast
to the earlier implementations of this concept,26,28,51 here we also have to consider the high operating
temperature of our system and thus develop a means to spatially separate
the catalyst from the Au nanoantenna to prevent alloy or intermetallic
phase formation between the two.52,53 For this purpose,
we further tailored our hole–mask colloidal lithography nanofabrication
approach (see Methods for details), to enable
the chemical vapor deposition of a thin SiO2 layer through the nanofabrication mask that encapsulates the entire Au nanoantenna before the growth of the Pt catalyst
nanoparticle (Figure 2a). In this way, due to the self-alignment, it becomes possible to
grow the catalyst exclusively on top of the nanoantenna sensor, while
simultaneously still completely encapsulating the underlying Au nanoantenna.
This results in a Au@SiO2–Pt hybrid nanostructure
with combined sensing (via the Au nanoantenna) and
catalytic (via the Pt) function (Figure 2b–d). Furthermore, since
different types of separating layers, as well as catalyst particle
materials, can be grown in this way, our approach is generic and can
be easily expanded to other catalyst systems to tailor the catalyst
formulation in a modular fashion.

scattering spectrum of the thermally treated Au@SiO2–Pt
nanostructure displayed in (f) together with the corresponding finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulation. (i) Graphic illustration of the used
FDTD simulation scheme assuming the following nanostructure dimensions
to mimic the Au@SiO2–Pt architecture after annealing:
Au disk: 90 nm × 27 nm, SiO2 thickness: 10 nm, Pt
nanoparticle: 65 nm × 28 nm.

To test the thermal and chemical stability of the Au@SiO2–Pt nanostructures used here, we thermally annealed
them at
623 K in 3% H2 + 3% O2 for 2 h and exposed them
to reaction environment for the CO-oxidation reaction (3% CO + 3%
O2) at 623 K for 0.5 h and in Ar carrier gas. The corresponding
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis reveals their structural
integrity, as well as the anticipated recrystallization of the Pt
(Figure 2e–g).
Furthermore, comparing a representative single-particle scattering
spectrum of such a nanoarchitecture after the thermal and reaction
treatment (Figure 2h) with a corresponding finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation
(Figure 2i depicts
the used simulation scheme) reveals good agreement and thus further
corroborates both the integrity of the nanostructure and the anticipated
coupling between the two metal elements, essential for the indirect
sensing principle.

To further characterize the Pt model catalyst
nanoparticles, we
performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. However,
since the entire Au@SiO2–Pt hybrid structure would
be too thick for TEM imaging, as well as would lead to convoluted
images due to the stacked Au and Pt particles, we nanofabricated analogous Pt model catalyst nanoparticles (i.e., without Au underneath) with the same size on
a TEM membrane and treated them in the same way as the real sample
at the reaction conditions described above. The corresponding TEM
images of representative Pt nanoparticles reveal the formation of
mainly polycrystals with various numbers of grains (Figure 3a). Further resorting to our
earlier detailed characterization of the grain structure in equivalently
nanofabricated Pd nanoparticles using transmission Kikuchi diffraction
(TKD), we conclude that each nanoparticle has its distinct and unique
grain structure with different grain orientation (cf. Figure 5 in ref (35)) and multiple surface facets exposed by the different grains (cf. Figure S17 in ref (35)). Hence they fulfill the desired criterion to
serve as single-particle model systems for structurally distinctly
different catalyst nanoparticles.

Pt nanoparticles after high-temperature annealing and reaction condition
treatment. (b) High-resolution XPS spectra in the Pt 4f spectral region
of a fresh and a reaction-treated Au@SiO2–Pt sample,
as well as of a Au@SiO2 (i.e., no Pt on top) control. As the main observation, we note that no
significant changes in terms of intensity or binding energy take place
for the Pt 4f lines (the small difference observed is a consequence
of surface charging effects due to the used oxidized silicon substrate),
corroborating that no Pt–Au alloy/intermetallic phase is formed,
and thus that the SiO2 encapsulation layer does not deteriorate
during reaction.

As the final characterization
step of the Au@SiO2–Pt
hybrid nanostructures to ensure that the SiO2 layer indeed
encapsulates the Au nanoantenna and prevents direct contact between
Au and Pt elements even at reaction conditions, we carried out X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Figure 3b). It reveals that the distinct characteristic
Pt 4f peaks are preserved even after the reaction treatment and thus
corroborates that no mixing with the Au nanoantenna has occurred.

To generally characterize the catalytic properties of the Au@SiO2–Pt hybrid nanostructures, we first performed ensemble-type experiments using the oxidation of carbon
monoxide (CO + 1/2 O2 → CO2) over Pt
as the model reaction.54 Specifically,
we put our focus on the phenomenon of kinetic phase transitions and
the corresponding reported kinetic bistabilities, that is, the existence
of two stable kinetic regimes that may coexist for a given set of
reaction conditions, which has been reported for the CO oxidation
reaction both on nanofabricated Pt model catalysts22 and on single-crystal surfaces.48 In the present case, as illustrated schematically in Figure 4, this means that at low relative
CO concentration, αCO = [CO]/([CO] + [O2]), or in other words in oxygen excess, the surface of the Pt nanoparticles
is mainly covered by dissociated chemisorbed oxygen (O). In this regime
the reaction rate is high and almost proportional to the supplied
CO concentration in the feed, since the influence of O on the sticking
probability of CO is small. Accordingly, the reaction rate increases
until a critical CO concentration is reached, and the kinetic phase
transition49 occurs to a new state where
the surface is predominantly covered by CO. In this state the reaction
rate is significantly reduced since the adsorbed CO molecules effectively
block or “poison” the chemisorption of O2 and thus limit the supply of O to form CO2. This asymmetry
in terms of poisoning in the O- or CO-covered surface regimes can
give rise to the coexistence of two stable kinetic states and thus
hysteresis in obtained reaction rates, depending on the initial surface
condition. Typically, at higher temperatures, the coexistence region
is narrowing and eventually disappears due to the increasing CO desorption
rate, which ultimately eliminates the poisoning effect.22,49

Figure 4 Schematic
depiction of the CO oxidation reaction and the three
kinetic regimes. The top scheme illustrates the key steps of the CO
oxidation reaction over a Pt catalyst, involving dissociative adsorption
of molecular oxygen, nondissociative adsorption of CO, and formation
and desorption of the CO2 reaction product. The bottom
scheme depicts the origin of the bistable kinetics at the interface
between the O-rich and CO-rich reaction regimes. In oxygen excess,
the surface of the Pt nanoparticles is mainly covered by dissociated
chemisorbed oxygen (O). By increasing the CO concentration in the
feed the reaction rate increases until a critical CO concentration
is reached and a so-called kinetic phase transition occurs to a state
where CO predominantly covers the surface.

To explore this phenomenon with our setup and for the Au@SiO2–Pt model catalyst, we varied αCO in
the reactant flow from a CO-rich to an O2-rich condition
and back again, while keeping the total reactant concentration ([CO]
+ [O2]) constant at 9% in Ar carrier gas. Simultaneously,
we continuously recorded both the CO2 partial pressure
in the reactor via the QMS and the plasmonic nanospectroscopy
peak position signal, λ, via the dark-field
scattering spectroscopy readout from a sample area comprising ca. 5000 Au@SiO2–Pt nanostructures (Figure 5a). The sample temperature
was set to 503 K. A complete αCO up- and down-sweep
together with the corresponding QMS and λ response are summarized
in Figure 5b. We observe
a maximum in the reaction rate at a critical reactant mixture αCOcr = 0.04–0.05, at which the optical λ
signal exhibits a distinct change in trend. Since the αCO steps displayed in Figure 5b are nonlinear in magnitude, this becomes clearer
in Figure 5c, where
the QMS and plasmonic nanospectroscopy data (now expressed as the
shift of the LSPR scattering peak position, Δλ, with respect
to the first taken data point at t = 0) are plotted
as a linear function of αCO. Both for the αCO up- and down-sweep, Δλ is essentially constant
for αCO < αCOcr and
then rapidly spectrally blue-shifts for αCO >
αCOcr, to reach a steady-state value beyond
αCO ≈ 0.2. The reaction rate obtained by the
QMS and
expressed as CO2 partial pressure in the chamber exhibits
a distinct maximum that coincides with the onset of the blue-shift
of Δλ.

spectrometry
for CO oxidation over Pt. (a) Schematic cross-section of the used
array of Au@SiO2–Pt nanostructures. (b) CO2 partial pressure measured by the QMS together with the corresponding
spectral position of the plasmonic scattering peak readout, λ,
obtained during reaction at 503 K. The data are plotted as a function
of the relative CO concentration in the gas flow, αCO = [CO]/([CO] + [O2], at a constant total reactant concentration
of 9% in Ar carrier gas. During the experiment, αCO is swept from 1 to 0 and back to 1, in steps of 0.006 close to αCOcr and in steps of 0.16 otherwise. As the key
feature, we observe that a distinct change in trend of the plasmonic
nanospectroscopy signal, λ coincides with the maximum in CO2 partial pressure measured simultaneously by the QMS at αCOcr = 0.04 ± 0.006. (c) The same data as in
(b) but plotted as a function of the αCO value for
0 < αCO < 0.5. Both for the αCO up- and down-sweep, the plasmonic peak shift, Δλ, is
essentially constant for αCO < αCOcr and then rapidly blue-shifts for αCO > αCOcr, to reach a steady-state
value
beyond αCO ≈ 0.2, where the catalyst activity
is essentially zero, as seen from the QMS signal. This is the signature
of the kinetic phase transition from a predominantly O-covered to
a reduced CO-covered surface.

It is now interesting to further discuss these data in the
context
of the bistable reaction kinetics introduced above. To this end, first,
we observe hysteresis between αCO up- and down-sweeps
in both the QMS and the Δλ response, in good agreement
with Johánek etal.,22 who investigated the bistability phenomenon
using molecular beam experiments on nanofabricated Pd model catalysts
over a wide size range (2–500 nm). They found a distinct particle
size dependence of the hysteresis as a consequence of the interplay
between a higher abundance of defects on smaller particles and fluctuations
between the two kinetic reaction regimes. Second, as predicted by
theory,49 we also observe increased or
decreased hysteresis width at lower and higher reaction temperature,
respectively (Figure S4), in both the QMS
and plasmonic nanospectroscopy response. This is the consequence of
CO poisoning being less severe at higher temperature due to enhanced
CO desorption. Third, we notice the excellent agreement in global
trend between QMS signal and Δλ response in the CO-rich
surface regime and the contrasting essentially constant Δλ
signal in the O-rich surface regime, despite a significant change
in reaction rate. This indicates that the plasmonic nanospectroscopy
signal, Δλ, directly reports the surface state of the
catalyst at in situ conditions, which at the kinetic
phase transition switches from an essentially constantly O-covered
(and thus presumably oxidized/reconstructed55−57) to a mainly
CO-covered surface. However, due to the relatively high temperature
of our experiment, the CO coverage depends more strongly on the absolute
αCO value than the O coverage (for which the higher
temperature rather stabilizes any oxide,55 if formed), since it dictates the equilibrium with CO in the gas
phase.49 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
in a recent combined photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and
QMS study58 of the local catalytic ignition
during CO oxidation on low-index Pt surfaces present on a polycrystalline
Pt foil that the global QMS CO2 signal obtained from the
entire foil (cf. Figure S1 in ref (58)) is significantly “smeared”
along the CO partial pressure axis (which is equivalent to αCO used here) compared to the PEEM intensity measured from
single grains with different surface termination ((111), (100), and
(110)) within the foil. Using the PEEM intensity together with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations the authors also showed that
the local kinetic phase diagrams for individual Pt grains in the foil
vary significantly depending on their index (cf.
Figure 3 in ref (58)). Hence, the smearing in the global QMS signal is a consequence
of the superposition of the local kinetics of all grains with a different
index present in the foil. In analogy, we argue that the same mechanism
is in play in our system since (111), (100), and (110) facets are
the dominant surfaces of nanofabricated Pt nanoparticles after annealing,
with significant variations in terms of their relative abundance from
particle to particle (see Figure 5 in ref (59)). Hence, the relatively gradual change of Δλ
across the kinetic phase transition and thus the corresponding gradual
change of CO surface coverage measured in our experiment (Figure 5c) are the consequence
of the ensemble averaging over ca. 5000 nanoparticles
with different facets that exhibit kinetic phase transitions at different
αCO.

To enable single-particle plasmonic nanospectroscopy
during CO
oxidation reaction conditions, we prepared a sample comprising three
different areas (Figure S5). In the center
is a 4 × 8 mm area with the standard nanoparticle surface coverage
of ca. 15% obtained by HCL nanofabrication,60 including a small region close to the edge (ca. 5% of the total surface area) with a particle coverage
low enough (i.e., particle–particle
distances larger than the diffraction limit) for single-particle plasmonic
nanospectroscopy (Figure 6a; see Methods for details of the
nanofabrication). To the left and right is a 4 × 8 mm area with
identical Au@SiO2–Pt nanostructures but at ca. 40% surface coverage to provide enough reaction product
for detection by the QMS. In total this means that about 109 particles are averaged for the QMS readout. Focusing optically
on the low-density area of this sample arrangement, we aligned a set
of four individual particles within the spectrometer slit, to track
their optical response simultaneously and independently (Figure 6b–e). These
four particles lie within an area of 35 μm × 6 μm
(Figure S 5d), which ensures that they
experience the same conditions. Using this arrangement, we executed
the same experiment as for the ensemble case discussed above, sweeping
αCO (9% total reactant concentration in Ar carrier
gas at a constant flow rate of 100 mL/min) in a stepwise fashion in
0.16 and 0.006 α-units per step for αCO >
0.2
and αCO < 0.2, respectively, from a CO-rich to
a O2-rich condition and back again. The sample temperature
was set to 503 K, and we simultaneously monitored the peak position,
λ, of the scattering spectra of the four catalyst nanoparticles
and the CO2 reaction product from the corresponding ensemble
(Figure 6f–i
and Figure S6 for a contour plot of the
entire spectral evolution).

The scattering spectra were taken for a surface in the CO-covered
state (blue) and in the oxidized O-covered state (black). Note the
difference in response for the two chemical states. (f–i) Combined
plots for scattering peak position λ obtained by plasmonic nanospectroscopy
(red) for each nanoparticle shown in (b)–(e) and the overall
CO2 partial pressure (black) in the reactor measured with
the QMS, acquired during a 15 h experiment sweeping αCO (blue) from 1 to 0 and then back to 1. We note a different but completely
reversible single-nanoparticle response. The black and blue arrows
indicate where along the experimental sequence the spectra shown in
(b)–(e) were taken.

To further analyze these raw data and decrease the noise
level,
we averaged the QMS and Δλ signals for each of the four
particles (Figure 7a–d; for an identical second data set measured at 533 K see Figure S7) over each 15 min long αCO step and plotted the corresponding averaged Δλ
values as a function of αCO for both increasing and
decreasing αCO (Figure 7e–h and i–l for zoom-in on
a narrower αCO range). We immediately notice that
the overall response looks quite different for the four nanoparticles,
which were measured all at the same time. Hence, we can ascribe these
differences to their individual response. For example, defining the
largest spectral shift between two data points as the kinetic phase
transition, we find that it occurs at values ranging from 0.0044 to
0.2 for the αCO up-sweep on the different particles.
At the same time, for the αCO down-sweep, the difference
between particles is smaller. Also hysteresis, however with different
width, occurs between the αCO up- and down-sweeps
for all four particles. These observations are in line with our arguments
put forward above,58 that is, that different
nanoparticles exhibit variations in terms of the relative abundance
of the dominant surface facets,59 as well
as in terms of grain boundaries and related defects (Figure 3). Consequently, they are expected
to exhibit the kinetic phase transition at different αCO, in agreement with what we observe in our experiments. Looking even
more in detail and comparing the single nanoparticle Δλ
response with the one from the ensemble (cf. Figure 5c), we note that
for the single nanoparticles distinct steps in Δλ and
thus in reactant surface coverage occur at the kinetic phase transition,
whereas such steps are absent in the ensemble data. Also this observation
is thus in line with the main hypothesis of our work, namely, that
single-nanoparticle experiments enable insights beyond ensemble averaging,
and it demonstrates that the rather smeared out transition in reactant
surface coverage reported by Δλ from the ensemble is the
consequence of averaging the rather sharp transitions of the individual
nanoparticles, which may occur across a range of αCO, dictated by the particle-specific abundance of grains, defects,
and certain surface facets. In this sense, our results for the individual
nanoparticles are also well in line with the PEEM study of the polycrystalline
Pt foil, for which the kinetic phase transition is rather continuous
at the global level and a distinct step at the level of the individual
grain with dimensions on the order of 100 μm (rather than 100
nm as in our case here).58 These observations
thus show how the reaction kinetics of simultaneously measured individual
model catalyst nanoparticles critically depend on their grain structure
and how such information can be obtained at in situ conditions (compared to the to-date used surface science techniques
operating at (ultra)high-vacuum conditions such as PEEM58) using plasmonic nanospectroscopy based on a
benchtop-type experimental setup comprising an optical microscope
and a traditional catalytic flow reactor operating at atmospheric
pressure.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have presented an experimental setup that combines in situ gas phase single-particle plasmonic nanospectroscopy
of individual catalyst nanoparticles with mass spectrometry on a corresponding
nanoparticle ensemble in one and the same experiment. In the current
design, the system operates at atmospheric pressure and is compatible
with temperatures of up to 623 K. We have also developed a nanofabrication
method for the crafting of Au@SiO2–Pt hybrid nanostructures
to achieve combined sensing function (via an oxide-encapsulated
Au nanoantenna) and catalytic function (via a single
Pt model catalyst particle on top) within the same structure, to enable
plasmonic nanospectroscopy based on the indirect sensing principle
at the single-nanoparticle level and in harsh conditions. To demonstrate
the capabilities of our setup, nanostructures, and the general experimental
approach, we used ∼20 × 70 nm polycrystalline Pt nanoparticles
as the active part in the Au@SiO2–Pt hybrid nanostructure
model system, since they offer maximized particle heterogeneity in
terms of defects and surface faceting at the single-nanoparticle level.
We then applied these structures to investigate the bistable kinetics
of the CO oxidation reaction over Pt. As the key results we first
found that a characteristic kinetic phase transition can be resolved
both at the ensemble and single catalyst nanoparticle level as a distinct
spectral shift in the plasmonic nanospectroscopy readout and that
it occurs at the highest reaction rate identified by the simultaneous
QMS readout. This is in agreement with theory and experimental data
obtained using surface science techniques in the corresponding literature.
Second, we found that the bistable reaction kinetics and the signature
of the kinetic phase transition of simultaneously measured individual
model catalyst nanoparticles critically depend on their grain structure,
defects, and surface faceting and that the superposition of the individual
nanoparticle response induces a significant broadening and smearing
in the corresponding kinetic response of a nanoparticle ensemble.
This highlights that our experimental approach, which enables studies
of catalysts both at the individual nanoparticle
level and at the ensemble level in the same system, has the potential
to shed light on the role of local catalyst design parameters, such
as loading, particle size, shape, and dispersion, as well as metal–support
interactions, on reaction kinetics, and how ensemble averaging limits
our insights in this respect. To this end, we also briefly summarize
the main challenges with the presented approach and developed instrumentation:
(i) To maintain the particles of interest in focus during the (typically
very long) experiments, in particular at elevated temperature due
to thermal expansion effects. Here we predict that the implementation
of active focus control solutions will lead to significant improvements
in this respect.61 (ii) To obtain enough
product from the reaction over these nanofabricated model catalysts
to enable online QMS detection. Here the use of microreactors with
significantly smaller volumes and thus QMS detection limits could
provide interesting solutions.62

In a wider perspective, we predict that our instrument as such,
due to the available high temperature and controlled gas environment,
and the experimental concept in particular, due to its high sensitivity,
will enable single-particle investigations of, for example, the catalyst
state during rate oscillations48 since
LSPR is highly sensitive to nanoparticle shape.63,56 Furthermore, it will enable studies of the role of the surface state
on noble metal catalysts such as Cu and Ag (which themselves are highly
plasmonically active) during reaction, of thermally induced nanoalloy
formation where LSPR will report on the concurrent change of the complex
dielectric function as alloy formation occurs,52,64 or of the annealing and segregation of alloy components in
bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions via LSPR interface damping effects that occur upon enrichment of a certain
element at the surface.65−67

Methods
Experimental
Setup
The main parts of the experimental
setup used in this work consisted of a in-house-built transparent
flow reactor, a quadrupole mass analyzer (Leda Mass Vacscan), a modified
Nikon upright microscope (Eclipse LV150N), and a spectrometer/CCD
system (Andor Shamrock 193i spectrograph and Andor Newton 920 CCD
camera), as shown schematically in Figure 1 and in detail in Figure S1 in the SI. The central part of the flow reactor is a KF40
Duran glass tube (Hositrad), with a round, 25 mm diameter flat borosilicate
optical window of 0.2 mm thickness welded in the center to allow collection
of images and spectra of individual nanoparticles through the microscope
objective in dark-field mode. The reactor is sealed using CF vacuum
flanges and Viton O-ring sealed KF flanges, and it operates at atmospheric
pressure. Reactants diluted in Ar carrier gas are introduced to the
reactor through a gas inlet tube welded onto one of the flanges. The
gas flow rate and composition are controlled by a set of mass flow
controllers (Bronkhorst Low-ΔP-flow and EL-flow). The gas outlet
is located on the opposite side of the flow reactor to maintain equilibrium
plug-flow conditions during the reaction. An in-house-built stainless
steel sample holder is mounted inside the reactor tube and equipped
with a ceramic resistive heater (Momentive HT01) onto which the sample
is clamped. The sample temperature is controlled by a power supply
(Instek GW GPS-1850) and a temperature controller (Eurotherm 3216) via a thermocouple-controlled feedback loop to maintain
a constant temperature. The latter also prevents defocusing of the
sample image during an experiment, which otherwise is induced by thermal
expansion and contraction of the sample holder. To enable the mass
spectrometric readout, the QMS glass capillary orifice “sniffer”
is mounted at the end of the gas transfer line (6.0 mm stainless steel
Swagelok tube) to allow only a small and controlled amount of gas
leakage into the mass analyzer chamber. The glass capillary orifice
was fabricated by inserting the tip of a borosilicate glass tube (2/0.1
mm outer/inner diameter, Hilgenberg) in a propane–oxygen flame
in order to shrink the inner diameter to a few micrometers. A detailed
description of this method can be found in ref (50). The gas leak rate through
the orifice is around 2 × 10–4 mbar s–1. With such a leak rate, the pressure inside the QMS analyzer chamber
stays below about 6.3 × 10–6 mbar, which guarantees
proper operation of the QMS. Such an orifice design enables efficient
molecular flow of the gas from the reactor to the QMS analyzer chamber
through the transfer line, and thus a fast response time can be achieved.
The gas transfer line outside of the reactor and the QMS analyzer
chamber are maintained at 385 K to prevent water condensation.

Mass Spectrometry
The QMS is controlled using a customized
LabVIEW control program. All QMS raw data were measured as ion current
of the corresponding gas. Since ≥91% of the gas inside the
reactor consists of Ar, the Ar partial pressure (PAr) is roughly estimated as being the same as atmospheric
pressure (1013.25 mbar). The partial pressure of reactants or product, Pi, was calculated in mbar by
comparison with the Ar signal according to the equation 1  where Ii and IAr are ion currents of gas species i and Ar measured directly by the QMS and Si is the relative sensitivity factor
(RSF) of the
quadrupole mass analyzer for species i. All shown
QMS data are corrected for any background recorded from a control
sample without Pt during an identical experimental sequence to the
real experiment.

Dark-Field Scattering Spectroscopy
White light from
the microscope lamp (Nikon LV-HL50W LL) is used to illuminate the
sample, which is mounted inside the reactor close to the optical window,
in dark-field mode through the objective (50× Nikon Plano LWD).
Scattered light from the sample is collected in a backscattering mode
using the objective and then directed toward the entrance slit of
the spectrograph through a pair of identical 2 in. plano-convex lenses
(f = 150 mm, Thorlabs). For single-particle measurements,
the sample surface was first imaged at the zero grating position with
the spectrometer slit fully open (2500 μm). After subsequently
aligning a group of suitable nanoparticles along the center of the
slit, the width of the slit was reduced to 450 μm to exclude
multiple nanoparticles from being recorded on the same position along
the y-axis of the CCD chip. The grating of the spectrograph
(150 lines/mm, blaze wavelength 800 nm) was then centered at a suitable
wavelength around 600–650 nm to acquire a dark-field scattering
spectrum from the scatterers on the sample aligned within the slit
of the spectrograph in the spectral imaging mode. Normalized scattering
spectra Isc from individual particles
were thus obtained as a function of wavelength λ using the relation Isc(λ) = (S – D)/CRS, where S is the collected signal
from an integrated area with nanoparticle, D is the
signal from the nearby area without nanoparticle (dark signal for
background correction taken from an area with identical pixel width
but without particles), and CRS is the signal collected from the diffuse
white certified reflectance standard bright reference sample (Labsphere
SRS-99-020). CRS is used in order to correct the signal for the lamp
spectrum. The acquisition time for each spectrum was 10 to 15 s depending
on the brightness of the particle. The obtained single-particle scattering
spectra were fitted with a Lorentzian function (±75 nm from the
peak position) to derive information about the temporal evolution
of the peak position.68

For scattering
measurements from nanoparticle ensembles, the slit width of the spectrometer
was reduced to 100 μm to prevent saturation of the CCD sensor
chip. To calculate normalized scattering spectra Isc, the background signal D was collected
from a blank substrate without any particles, under the same conditions
as when the signal S was collected. The same CRS
as in single-particle measurements was used for spectrum correction.
Peak position was extracted using the same fitting procedure as in
single-particle measurements.

Sample Nanofabrication
The Au@SiO2–Pt
nanostructures were fabricated on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate
(100 nm oxide thickness) using a tailored variant of the hole–mask
colloidal lithography (HCL) method that is described in detail elsewhere.60 The main new step in the present nanofabrication
route is the growth of a 10 nm thin SiO2 layer through the nanofabrication mask generated using the standard
HCL process, encapsulating a plasmonic nanoantenna particle grown
before. The key step enabling this through-mask sputtering without
compromising the final lift-off step is a prolonged oxygen plasma
etch (90 s, 50 W, 250 mTorr, Plasma-Therm Batchtop RIE 95m) to create
a significant underetch in the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist
of the mask after the polystyrene bead tape-stripping step. After
this plasma etch, the SiO2 encapsulation was grown in an
Oxford Plasmalab 100 inductively coupled plasma 180 at room temperature
with a base pressure of 3 × 10–7 Torr and a
deposition rate of 2.75 Å/s. The Au nanoantennas, which were
grown using e-beam evaporation (Lesker PVD 225, base pressure of 5
× 10–7 Torr, 1.5 Å/s deposition rate),
have nominal dimensions of 110 ± 10 nm in diameter and 20 nm
in height. After encapsulation in the 10 nm SiO2 shell,
the Pt catalyst nanoparticle was then evaporated on top (Lesker PVD
225, base pressure of 5 × 10–7 Torr, 1.5 Å/s
deposition rate), also still through the hole–mask, at a nominal
thickness of 10 nm. A control sample was fabricated following the
same recipe except for omitting the last step that evaporates the
Pt catalyst. Finally, lift-off was used to remove the PMMA resist
and all metal layers by step-by-step sonication in mr-Rem 700 (Microresist
Technology GmbH), isopropyl alcohol, and acetone. It is important
to note that the single-particle region of 5% coverage was formed
due to faster drying at the edge when blow-drying after drop-casting
a polystyrene (PS) solution onto the substrate. To increase coverage
from 15% to 40%, 0.1 mmol of NaCl was added to the PS solution to
reduce interparticle repulsion and thus particle density.69

CO Oxidation Experiments on Pt Catalyst Nanoparticle
Ensemble
Prior to sweeping αCO in the kinetic
phase transition
experiments, the sample was exposed to 20 cycles of alternating 9%
CO (6.0 purity in Ar) and 9% O2 (6.0 purity in Ar) pulses
of 15 min duration, followed by a 1 h pulse of 9% CO, in order to
activate the catalyst and reach a stable optical signal. During this
treatment, the sample temperature was kept at 553 K. For the αCO sweep, the temperature was kept constant at the set value,
and the sample was exposed to a constant total reactant concentration
[CO + O2] of 9%, at a constant flow rate of 100 mL/min.
A scattering spectrum was simultaneously collected every 60 s using
an integration time of 0.1 s and 10 accumulations for the CCD. With
the QMS, the ion currents of CO, CO2, air/N2, O2, and Ar inside the reactor were continuously measured
at a mass value of 28, 44, 14, 32 and 40, respectively, with a time
resolution of 5 s. The QMS was operated in SEM mode. To subtract the
CO2 background signal, measurements on a control sample
without Pt under the exact experiment conditions were also carried
out at corresponding temperatures. The CO2 QMS signal shown
in this article for both ensemble and single-particle experiments
is corrected by subtracting the CO2 signal from the sample
with Pt from the control sample without Pt catalyst.

CO Oxidation
Experiments on Single Pt Catalyst Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles
in the sample region of low particle density as shown
in Figure S5d were chosen to achieve well-separated
(>20 pixels) diffraction-limited spots on the CCD sensor chip,
using
the 50× objective of the microscope. The sample stage was adjusted
to align the image of the chosen nanoparticles within the view of
the spectrometer slit set to a 450 μm opening. The scattered
light from each nanoparticle dispersed by the grating was collected
in spectral image mode with 14 s integration time and accumulated
with 4 acquisitions every 60 s. The same conditions as in the ensemble
CO oxidation experiment were applied to compare the two results directly.
A normalized scattering spectrum from each nanoparticle was extracted
and fitted according to the procedure described in the previous dark-field
scattering spectroscopy method section to extract the peak position.
