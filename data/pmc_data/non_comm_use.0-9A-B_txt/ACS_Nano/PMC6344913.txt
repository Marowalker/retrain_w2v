Solid-state nanopores
are single-molecule sensors that hold great
potential for rapid protein and nucleic-acid analysis. Despite their
many opportunities, the conventional ionic current detection scheme
that is at the heart of the sensor suffers inherent limitations. This
scheme intrinsically couples signal strength to the driving voltage,
requires the use of high-concentration electrolytes, suffers from
capacitive noise, and impairs high-density sensor integration. Here,
we propose a fundamentally different detection scheme based on the
enhanced light transmission through a plasmonic nanopore. We demonstrate
that translocations of single DNA molecules can be optically detected,
without the need of any labeling, in the transmitted light intensity
through an inverted-bowtie plasmonic nanopore. Characterization and
the cross-correlation of the optical signals with their electrical
counterparts verify the plasmonic basis of the optical signal. We
demonstrate DNA translocation event detection in a regime of driving
voltages and buffer conditions where traditional ionic current sensing
fails. This label-free optical detection scheme offers opportunities
to probe native DNA–protein interactions at physiological conditions.

==== Body
Nanopores
are an emergent class
of label-free single-molecule biosensors that are projected to significantly
impact the multibillion dollar markets of diagnostics and medicine1,2 by providing a starting point on the roadmap to personalized medicine.3 The simple concept of shrinking the sensor down
to the size of the molecule that it is probing has already brought
a commercial DNA sequencing device,4 and
applications in diagnostics and biophysics are currently being explored.
Example applications include the analysis of blood serum,5 the classification of proteins in solution,6−8 and characterization of DNA–protein binding.9,10 To date, nanopore-based detection schemes rely almost exclusively
on the modulation of an ionic current to report on the small changes
in physical size of the analyte during its passage through the nanopore.11 However, the ionic current is set up by a transmembrane
driving voltage that controls the translocation speed of the molecules,
thus inextricably linking the signal strength and the translocation
time. Furthermore, the ionic current strongly depends on the electrolyte
concentration, characteristically high-molar (∼1 M) salt solutions,
rendering sensing at physiological conditions impractical. Finally,
the requirement for individual current amplifiers for read-out of
each nanopore limits the sensors density in scalable integration on
chip.12 Alternative read-out strategies
based on silicon nanowire FETs,13 calcium
fluorescence,14,15 tunneling junctions,16 and even graphene nanoribbons17−19 have been developed
to address these issues. While some of these approaches are more permissive
for sensor parallelization, these schemes have not demonstrated full
independence of ion flow or electrolyte composition to mediate and
amplify the signal of interest. Completely decoupling the biomolecular
signal from the driving voltage and buffer conditions will increase
the versatility and scalability of nanopore sensing.

To overcome
these challenges, we propose a radically different,
purely optical, nanopore read-out mechanism based on single-molecule
plasmonic resonance sensing through enhanced light transmission.11,20 In this scheme, changes in light intensity transmitted through a
resonant nanoscale aperture report on the presence and conformation
of biomolecules. The plasmonic excitations of the metal’s electron
gas can mediate the propagation of light through subdiffraction-limit
apertures, enhancing the light transmission.21,22 The magnitude of this light transmission is strongly dependent on
the wavelength and polarization of the excitation light, the geometry
of the nanostructure, and its dielectric environment.23 The latter strong sensitivity of the resonance of nanoaperture
to the local environment allows for the optical sensing of molecules20 that reside in the optical near-field of the
aperture. The near-fields can be highly concentrated in the aperture
by using small nanogaps24 that focus the
plasmon oscillation into this gap, creating intense optical hotspots.
These hotspots have been used to study nonlinear optical effects,25 perform molecular spectroscopy,26 and trap single-molecules through nanotweezing.27,28 The resonance that excites the gap is extremely sensitive to the
local refractive index in the hotspot, and the presence of biomolecules
in the gap is thus communicated to the far field by variations in
the light transmission intensity.

By integrating a nanopore
right at the feed gap of the plasmonic
nanoantenna, biomolecules can be directly delivered to the nanogap,
ensuring interaction of the analyte with the hotspot,29 overcoming electrostatic surface repulsion and bypassing
the otherwise diffusion-limited arrival times of biomolecules to the
sensor.30 Several experimental accounts
have been published on plasmonic nanopores for single-molecule biosensing,
but so far these focused on nanoplasmonic heating,31,32 Raman scattering,33 and fluorescence
detection,34 while plasmon resonance sensing
has remained unexplored. Because plasmon resonance sensing is purely
optical, the signal from a translocating biomolecule is without any
fluorescent labels and entirely independent of the buffer conditions
and driving voltage used, creating a versatile and more powerful nanopore
sensor that naturally allows for high-density integration on a device.35

Here, we experimentally show simultaneous
ionic-current and optical-transmission-based
detection of single-molecule DNA translocations through a nanopore
integrated in the gap of a bowtie-shaped gold plasmonic nanoaperture.
By characterizing the optical signal, we verify the plasmonic origin
of the effect and show that the amplitude of the optical transients
is driving-voltage and buffer independent. We demonstrate that the
optical detection scheme outperforms the ionic-current detection at
high measurement bandwidth and can detect translocations of DNA molecules
in e.g. physiological buffer conditions where the traditional ionic-current
detection loses its sensitivity.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication
and Characterization of the Inverted-Bowtie Plasmonic
Nanopore
Figure 1a shows a schematic of the experimental setup. Light transmission
is monitored by sandwiching a plasmonic nanopore device in between
two objectives, one for excitation and one for collection of the transmitted
light (Figure 1a).
The plasmonic antenna is a bowtie-shaped nanoaperture in a 100 nm
thick gold film. The apertures, fabricated using electron-beam lithography
on a thick PMMA/MMA-MAA/PMGI resist layer, are placed on a 20 nm thin
freestanding silicon-nitride (SiN) membrane by wedging transfer (for
fabrication details, see Methods section). Figure 1b shows a transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image of a typical nanoantenna with a feed
gap of 20 nm, a width of 160 nm across, and a side length of 100 nm.
More images can be found in Supporting Information (SI) Section S1. The nanopore is drilled right in
the center of the feed gap of the antenna using TEM drilling, as shown
in the false-colored zoom in Figure 1b.

for the idealized geometry (outlined in orange) of the nanoantenna
in (b), clearly revealing optical-field localization and field enhancement
up to 12 times in the gap region of the antenna. Scale bars are 50
nm.

We illuminate the inverted bowtie
with an infrared 1064 nm laser,
while an electrical bias is applied across the supporting SiN membrane.
The DC electrical bias serves to drive biomolecules through the nanopore
sensor by electrophoresis. The light transmitted through the nanoantenna
is monitored using an avalanche photodetector (APD), and the ionic
current is simultaneously observed using a conventional current amplifier
(see Methods section). When illuminated with
light that is polarized across the feed gap direction of the antenna
(longitudinal polarization, see Figure 1c), a plasmon resonance is excited that enhances and
concentrates the electromagnetic field to the hotspot in the gap of
the antenna. Figure 1c shows the spatial distribution of the normalized electric-field
strength in the antenna at 1064 nm wavelength excitation resulting
from a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The light
is clearly concentrated in the gap, and an electric field enhancement
up to a factor 12 compared to the incident light can be achieved (see Methods section for simulation details). The simulations
are validated through a comparison of experimental transmission spectra
with simulated ones, see SI Section S2.
Importantly, the gap resonance is not excited when
illuminating the antenna with light polarized in the orthogonal orientation
(transverse polarization), and hence the field localization is absent
and light transmission through the nanoaperture is minimal in that
case (see SI Section S3). The approach
presented here aims to optically sense single DNA molecules as they
traverse through a plasmonic nanopore, where the presence of the DNA
in the hotspot may affect the resonance of the nanoantenna, hence
modulating the optical transmission intensity (Figure 1a).

Before adding DNA, we first test
and characterize the plasmonic
nanopore. After mounting the sample in a custom-made flow cell, electrolyte
is flushed in, a bias voltage of 100 mV is applied using a pair of
Ag/AgCl electrodes to induce an ionic current flow, and the membrane
is scanned with a 1064 nm wavelength laser focused to a diffraction-limited
spot (∼0.8 μm in size). Excitation of the plasmonic nanopore
by the laser focus will lead to localized plasmonic heating. This,
in turn, creates a small temperature increase at the nanopore that
can be observed by monitoring the temperature-sensitive ionic current
through the pore36 and allows for accurately
aligning the nanopore with the laser focus. 7.5 milliwatts of excitation
power, for example, resulted in a measured temperature increase of
3.6 °C at the nanopore, in good agreement with predictions from
simulations (see SI Section S4). Please
note that the temperature increase observed in the inverted antenna
is very significantly lower than that observed for a typical freestanding
dimer antenna,31 due to a much more efficient
heat dissipation by the 100 nm thick surrounding gold film and the
slight off-resonant excitation of the plasmonic gap mode.

Optical Light
Transmission Exhibits Transient Signals Caused
by DNA Translocations
Next, we test the use of these plasmonic
nanopores as optical single-molecule sensors. After adding λ-DNA
to the SiN side of the chip and applying a 200 mV bias, transient
decreases characteristic for DNA translocations can be clearly observed
in the time traces of the ionic current, as shown in blue in Figure 2a. Gratifyingly,
concurrent spikes are also observed in the time traces of the normalized
optical transmission intensity (IOT),
as shown in red in Figure 2a. This demonstrates that the nanoantenna can be used to optically
detect DNA translocations through a nanopore in a label-free manner.
Inspection of the two traces shows that the transient signals are
very closely correlated, i.e., each time that an optical spike is
observed, there is a concurrent spike in the ionic current signal,
which demonstrates that the signals in the optical transmission are
induced by translocating DNA molecules.

Figure 2 Simultaneous detection
of DNA translocations in the ionic current
and transmitted light. (a) Time traces of both the ionic current (blue)
and normalized optical light transmission (norm. IOT, red) in 2 M LiCl after the addition of λ-DNA,
at a bias voltage of 200 mV and 2.5 mW laser power. Clear transients
due to DNA translocation can be observed concurrently in both traces.
(b) Zooms and schematic interpretation of the events observed in (a),
for two linear DNA translocations (left), two fully folded DNA translocations
(middle), and two partially folded DNA translocations (right). Whereas
5 out of 19 linear events are detected optically, 86 out of 92 folded
events are optically detected. For display purposes, electrical traces
are low-pass filtered with a 1 kHz Gaussian filter, and optical traces
are band-pass filtered using 2-pole Butterworth filter with a 4 Hz
to 1 kHz window.

Closer examination of
the spikes in the ionic current (blue, Figure 2b) reveals current
blockade signatures that are typical of DNA translocations: for large
nanopores (>5 nm) DNA molecules can either enter in a linear fashion
(blue, left two examples Figure 2b), with one double strand of DNA in the nanopore,
or they can traverse the pore in a folded fashion (blue, remaining
examples Figure 2b)
with two double strands of DNA temporarily residing in the nanopore.37,38 The use of 2 M LiCl electrolyte produces excellent signal-to-noise
characteristics in the electrical trace () and allows these folds to be easily identified.
Interestingly, inspection of the optical traces reveals very similar
characteristics, where the folds detected in the ionic current are
also discernible in the optical channel (red, right two examples Figure 2b), albeit at a clearly
lower signal-to-noise level ().
Whereas with the current signal-to-noise
ratio, linear translocations may occasionally escape our optical detection
(red, second example from the left in Figure 2b), folded events are systematically detected
(red, remaining examples on the right of Figure 2b). Notably, the excellent correlation of
electrical and optical signals as well as the observation of folded
events in the optical signal immediately leads to the conclusion that
the optical signal arises from the nanoscale localized region of the
nanoaperture. Moreover, the optical signatures from DNA molecules
that are translocated from the gold side of the chip are identical
to translocations from the SiN side, and thus the observed signals
are not due to modulation of the light by the large (∼1 μm)
DNA polymer blob that resides above or below the pore before or after
the molecule translocates through the pore.

DNA Signals in Optical
Light Transmission Arise from a Plasmonic
Resonance Shift
Next, we verify that our optical transmission
signals originate from the plasmonic gap resonance of the nanoantenna.
First, we confirm that the signal from translocating DNA molecules
is mediated by the excitation of the plasmonic gap resonance. For
this, we perform DNA translocations under different illumination conditions.
When the incident laser light is polarized in the longitudinal direction
(cf. inset to Figure 3a), it excites the gap resonance and concurrent transient signals
from translocating DNA molecules are observed in both the electrical
and optical channels (Figure 3a). For the transverse polarization (inset Figure 3b), on the contrary, no optical
transients are observed whatsoever, whereas DNA translocations are
clearly discerned in the ionic current (Figure 3b). This confirms expectations since changing
the polarization of the incident light to the transverse orientation
should remove the field localization in the gap of the antenna, and
hence the light transmission should no longer be sensitive to changes
in dielectric environment of the gap region. Typically, the light
transmission through the antenna under the transverse illumination
is significantly lower than under longitudinal excitation. To make
a fair comparison, we increase the detector gain and the incident
laser power from 7.5 mW to 20 mW such that the absolute transmission
baseline during transverse illumination is matched to the transmission
baseline during longitudinal excitation. Still, no optical transients
can be detected. The absence of signatures from translocating DNA
molecules in the transverse illumination condition clearly shows that
the signals in the optical channel indeed originate from the excitation
of the plasmonic gap mode.

Figure 3 Characterization of the optical signals for
DNA translocations.
(a) λ-DNA translocations in 2 M LiCl under longitudinal polarization.
Translocations produce clear transients in both the electrical trace
(top, blue) and in the transmitted light trace when longitudinal excitation
is used (bottom, red). (b) λ-DNA translocations in 2 M LiCl
under transverse polarization. No transients are produced in the optical
trace, whereas they are clearly discerned in the ionic current trace.
(c) Scatter plot of optical event amplitudes versus the signal
durations for 20 kbp DNA at 7.5 mW laser power and different driving
voltages. A clear shift is observed toward short event durations at
different driving voltages, but the average event amplitude remains
unchanged. (d) Histogram peak of all optical events for 20 kbp DNA
translocations as a function of driving voltage. The signal amplitude
seems to be independent of applied voltage. The peak signal indicates
the signal strength from a folded translocation. Error bars are the
standard deviation in the normalized transmission baseline. (e) Heat
map from the scatter plot of average optical event amplitudes versus
the signal durations for 20 kbp DNA for two different excitation powers.
(f) Normalized average experimental signal amplitude from all
optical events versus the normalized simulated transmission change
upon the insertion of two double strands of DNA in the gap of each
individual nanoantenna (see SI Section S8). The experimental signal follows a linear trend through the origin
as predicted by the simulations, albeit with a factor three lower
signal amplitude (linear fit, blackline, ).

To assess whether or not the amplitude of the optical transients
is independent from the electrical bias, we characterize the dependence
of the optical signal on the driving voltage. Figure 3c shows a scatter plot of the optical event
amplitudes ΔIOTversus the event durations for translocations of 20 kbp DNA molecules at
different voltages (for details on the event detection and analysis,
see Methods). The scatters show a characteristic
L-shape clustering of events (see SI Section S5) that is typically observed for ionic current events in nanopores
that are wide enough to permit folded translocations.38 Clearly, the clusters shift to shorter event duration times
for higher driving voltages. Notably, however, the optical signal
amplitude remains unchanged. This sharply contrasts the amplitude
of the electrical signals which originates from the ionic current
blockade and scales linearly with voltage (see SI Section S5). Figure 3d quantifies this independence of the transmission signal
amplitude for folded events versus voltage (see SI Section S6 for details).

The fact that we observe
a well-defined amplitude level of the
optical signal from a dsDNA strand present in the gap is actually
striking in light of extensive previous work that reported a strong
heterogeneity of the signal strengths. Generally, molecules that approach
a plasmonic nanostructure encounter a spatially inhomogeneous hotspot,
producing varying signal strengths as a result.39 In our case, the nanopore delivers the biomolecule directly
into the hotspot by design, reducing uncertainties in the exact location
for the interaction of the molecule with the hotspot of the nanoantenna,
and furthermore the hotspot region is approximately homogeneous due
to off-resonant excitation of the antenna (see Figure 1c and SI Section S7).

Because the optical signals from translocating DNA molecules
are
only observed in longitudinal excitation and are voltage independent,
we conclude that these signals originate from a shift of the plasmonic
gap resonance that is temporarily induced by the translocating molecule.
First, this explains the observed transient decreases in transmitted
light as the presence of a molecule in the hotspot will induce a redshift
of the antenna resonance, which results in a reduction in transmitted
light intensity as the antenna is excited at a wavelength shorter
than the peak of the resonance of the nanoantenna. Second, this predicts
that the signal strength should depend linearly on the excitation
power, since the transmitted light intensity through the nanoaperture IOT will scale linearly with the excitation power
of the 1064 nm wavelength laser. Figure 3e shows a heat map of the absolute event
amplitudes ΔIOTversus the event durations for 7.5 mW and 15 mW of laser power.
An increase in signal strength is indeed observed, indicated by a
shift of the event population toward higher signal amplitude. The
average signal amplitude for two double strands of DNA increased from ΔIOT = 2.0 ± 0.7 · 10–3 au to ΔIOT = 3.4 ± 1.0 ·
10–3 au (mean values and standard deviations of
the distribution). Increasing the laser power leaves the signal-to-noise
level unchanged, as the increased baseline transmission is accompanied
by a similar increase in baseline variance. We note that the larger
incident power produces a slightly higher temperature increase at
the nanopore (7.0 °C increase at 15 mW, compared to 3.6 °C
at 7.5 mW), but we do not expect this to have an impact on the optical
signal strength, contrary to what is observed for the ionic current
signal.31

Finally, we compare the
signal amplitude from DNA translocations
with predictions from FDTD simulations. Here, we examine the resonance
of the fabricated nanoantennas with and without two double strands
of DNA present in the center of the nanopore, and we extract the DNA
signal amplitude by subtracting the two simulated transmission values
at λ = 1064 nm (details in SI Section S8 and Methods). Figure 3f shows the normalized average experimental
signal amplitude for two double strands of DNA versus the normalized
simulated signal amplitude. The simulated and experimental signal
intensities correlate very well and follow a linear trend through
the origin, though quantitatively the simulations overestimate the
signal strength by a factor of 3. The good correlation between the
experimental and simulated results is quite striking, considering
the crudeness of the simplified DNA modeling,40,41 and it further corroborates that the optical transients arise from
a shift of the plasmonic gap resonance.

The Optical Sensing Volume
Is Located in the Gap of the Nanoantenna
The transit times
for moving the DNA through the plasmonic nanopore
are very similar for the optical and electrical signals. Figure 4a displays an example
of the electrical signal and the optical signal for the same DNA-translocation
event. Using simple thresholding, the duration of an event is defined
as the time in between the baseline crossings prior and posterior
to the spike. Figure 4b shows the scatter of the signal durations for the electrical (tE) and optical channels (tO), for events that are simultaneously well resolved in both
channels (63% of all events) for λ-DNA translocations at 200
mV. The data show a clear linear correlation (r =
0.58) but display an appreciable scatter as the low signal-to-noise
levels for one double strand of DNA in the optical channel troubled
the correlation. The observed passage times are similar to the passage
times observed in a normal solid-state SiN nanopore under these conditions,
indicating that plasmonic trapping forces42 and DNA gold-surface interactions43 do
not play a major role here. However, appropriate excitation of the
nanoantenna closer to the plasmon resonance can strengthen optical
forces44 that could slow down and even
stall the DNA translocation process.29

Figure 4 Electrical
and optical signal time correlation analysis. (a) Overlay
of the optical (red) and electrical signal (blue) for one DNA translocation
event; tE and tO indicate the event duration for an electrical and optical signal,
respectively. Signal duration is defined as the time taken between
two consecutive baseline crossings before and after the spike that
is detected by thresholding (see Methods section).
(b) Correlation plot of the electrical and optical signal durations
of all simultaneously detected events (63% (33 out of 74 linear events
and 68 out of 86 folded events) from all ionic current events, conducted
in 2 M LiCl and 200 mV, 2.5 mW) showing a correlation between both
signal durations (r = 0.58). The deviations from tE = tO (black line)
arise from inaccurate determination of the optical signal duration
due to its lower signal-to-noise ratio. (c) Cross-correlation between
all events in (b). A broad peak emerges around τ = 0. The zoom
shows a closer inspection of the peak, which reveals a small delay
in the optical signal of around 140 ± 190 μs.

Even though the optical and electrical signals
both probe the DNA
molecule at the nanopore during the translocation, the sensing regions
of both signals are not exactly identical. For the ionic current,
the sensing region largely comprises of the nanopore volume45 that spans the 20 nm thickness of the SiN membrane.
For the optical signal, however, the sensing region is confined to
the hotspot region with the increased optical field, which is localized
within the gap of the inverted-bowtie antenna and which spans roughly
uniformly across the total thickness of the 100 nm gold film on top
of the nanopore (SI Section S7). Modifying
the nanostructure design will allow for the engineering of the field
localization to create even more focused sensing regions, for example
by using tapering of the sidewall of the gold structure.46 From a detailed analysis of the signals, we
can deduce a subtle timing difference between these sensing regions.
Due to the design of the plasmonic nanopore, the electrical and optical
sensing regions are stacked vertically. Since the analyte is added
to the SiN side of the chip, the translocating molecules are first
inserted in the nanopore, passing its electrical sensing region, before
they subsequently enter the optical sensing region in the gold nanoaperture. Figure 4c shows the lumped
cross-correlation of all simultaneously detected signals from Figure 4b. A broad peak (full-width
half-maximum 4.3 ms) is observed around a time delay of zero, as is
expected for signals that originate from the same translocation events.
However, a closer inspection (see inset Figure 4c) reveals that the correlation function C(τ) peaks at τ = 140 ± 190 μs (mean
and standard error of the mean), i.e., the onset of the optical signal
is measured slightly later than the electrical signal. This delay
time corresponds to roughly 560 ± 760 nm distance traveled for
a translocating DNA molecule, using an average translocation time
of ∼4 ms for a linear 16 μm long λ-DNA molecule
(Figure 3c). The very
large error bar prevents an accurate comparison to the expected offset
of ∼100 nm, viz., the vertical distance between
the electrical and optical sensing volumes.

Advantages of Optical Transmission
Sensing over Conventional
Ionic Current Sensing
After validating the reliability of
the optical sensing method, we demonstrate some of the advantages
that the method offers over traditional ionic current sensing. The
first and foremost benefit is the decoupling of the driving voltage
from the signal strength. Signals in ionic current sensing rely on
the physical obstruction of an ion flow by the volume of the biomolecule,
and better signals are obtained if larger currents are present, which
intrinsically requires the application of a larger driving voltage.
In sharp contrast, the optical signals rely on a change in plasmon
resonance that is independent of the bias voltage. The decoupling
of the signal from the driving allows the translocation process to
be studied at any driving voltage, even in the absence of any bias. Figure 5a demonstrates this
by showing time traces of 20 kbp DNA molecules translocating a 20
nm nanopore at 500 mM LiCl at different driving voltages. DNA translocation
events can clearly be observed in both the electrical and optical
channels at 200 mV bias voltage (left, Figure 5a). At 100 mV bias, the signal strength from
the events in the current channel is decreased significantly (center, Figure 5a), and at 50 mV
it completely disappears in the noise floor (right, Figure 5a). On the contrary, the signal
in the optical channel remains the same at each bias voltage, and
translocations can still be well resolved at 50 mV bias. This is also
demonstrated in Figure 5b, where the optical signal-to-noise ratio stays constant versus
applied bias voltage, whereas the electrical signal-to-noise ratio
decreases steeply.

Figure 5 Advantages of optical light transmission over traditional
ionic
current sensing. (a) Electrical (blue) and optical (red) time traces
during a 20 kbp DNA translocation experiment at 500 mM LiCl at different
driving voltages. Whereas the ionic current signal decreases with
driving voltage and disappears at 50 mV bias, the optical signal remains
unchanged, and translocations can still be detected. (b) The signal-to-noise
level as a function of decreasing voltage for both electrical and
optical signals displayed in (a). (c) Normalized power spectral density
(PSD, divided by the square of the average baseline signal) of the
ionic current (top, blue) and optical transmission (bottom, red).
For the ionic current a clear f1 scaling
is present at high frequencies due to dielectric noise, and interference
peaks are present. Contrary to the electrical channel, the power spectrum
of the optical channel is flat (f0) and
free of interference. The insets show a typical event (taken from
a measurement conducted at 500 mM, 100 mV, and 7.5 mW using 20 kbp
DNA) filtered using various low-pass cutoff filter frequencies. (d)
Log–log plot of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) versus low-pass cutoff filtering frequency,
assuming a fixed signal strength for each. A f–0.5 scaling can be observed for the optical S/N versus a f–1 scaling for the electrical S/N. (e) S/N for both the optical
and electrical signal of 20 kbp DNA translocations at 100 mV and 7.5
mW in different LiCl concentrations. A clear decrease can be observed
for the electrical signal, preventing DNA translocations to be detected
electrically at 125 mM LiCl. The optical signal-to-noise ratio remains
unchanged with different LiCl concentrations, and DNA translocations
can still be discerned at 125 mM.

As a second advantage, optical detection schemes offer, in
principle,
much higher-bandwidth data acquisition, as was also pointed out by
others.14Figure 5b shows the normalized power spectral density
(PSD) versus frequency plot of the electrical (top, blue) and optical
channels (bottom, red). The ionic current channel displays 1/f type noise in the low-frequency region as well as dielectric
noise47 in the high-frequency region, manifested
as a linear dependence of the PSD on f (see Figure 5c). Moreover, the
channel suffers from electrical interference pick-up in the high frequency
part of the spectrum, indicated by the strong peaks in this region.
By contrast, the PSD from the optical transmission channel is flat
at high frequencies (indicated by the horizontal line in Figure 5c) and is free of
any electric interference. It implies that the signal-to-noise ratio
will decrease more rapidly for the electrical signals than for the
optical signals if the larger acquisition bandwidth is used. This
is illustrated by the insets in Figure 5c, where the same translocation event (500 mM LiCl,
100 mV) is shown at full bandwidth in the electrical (inset in top
panel) and optical channel (inset in bottom panel), but subsequently
filtered at different low-pass cutoff frequencies. It is clear that
the noise levels increase much more strongly with higher cutoff frequencies
for the electrical compared to the optical channel, resulting more
quickly in the onset of signal loss. Figure 5d quantifies this assertion by plotting the
signal-to-noise ratio as a function of frequency. The signal-to-noise
levels for the ionic current scale as f–1 for high frequencies (blue, Figure 5d). On the other hand, the spectrally flat frequency
dependence of the background fluctuations in the optical channel leads
to a f–0.5 dependence in the signal-to-noise
ratio (red in Figure 5d), meaning that the optical signal will be more tolerant to increasing
measurement bandwidth than the electrical signal.

Finally, the
signal strength from plasmon resonance changes is
independent of buffer conditions, contrary to the ionic current sensing
which requires high concentrations of ions, thus allowing experiments
to be conducted at any buffer composition and electrolyte concentration. Figure 5e shows the signal-to-noise
level for translocation experiments at different electrolyte concentrations
for the electrical signal (blue) and optical signal (red). A clear
decrease in the electrical signal-to-noise ratio can be observed for
lower salt concentrations. Importantly, at a physiological salt concentration
of 125 mM LiCl the electrical signal completely disappears in the
noise floor. This decrease can be attributed to a decrease in signal
strength, as the current noise does not lower significantly upon lowering
the electrolyte concentrations.48 By contrast,
the optical signal-to-noise ratio remains unchanged, as expected,
and translocations can still be observed even at 125 mM LiCl. This
demonstrates that, importantly, the optical sensing technique alleviates
the restriction to high-salt concentrations which often limits nanopore
sensing if physiological conditions are required.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a label-free optical sensing
technique using plasmonic nanopores that allows for probing translocating
biomolecules independently from the applied driving voltage and electrolyte
concentrations used. The detection is based on the enhanced light
transmission through an inverted bowtie nanoantenna with a nanopore
drilled in its feed gap and relies on a plasmon resonance shift induced
by the presence of the molecule in the gap of the nanoantenna. We
have shown that the transmitted light through the nanoantenna produces
an optical signal that can report on the conformation of translocating
DNA molecules. Our observations indicate that the optical sensing
region lies within the gap of the plasmonic nanoantenna and that the
noise for this optical sensing scheme increases with measurement bandwidth
more favorably than for ionic current detection. In future work, it
will be advantageous to improve the signal in our detection scheme,
for example by bringing the resonance of the plasmonic nanoantennas
closer to the excitation laser or by modifying the antenna layout.

The here reported label-free optical detection scheme may be used
in various biosensing applications. The optical observation of DNA
in such wide (20 nm) plasmonic nanopores naturally allows for an extension
to the detection of protein–DNA complexes and large proteins
in native salt conditions. Moreover, optical detection schemes are
well suited for high-density nanopore device integration, which is
challenging to be achieved when ionic current sensing is employed.
Finally, the decoupling of the signal and driving voltage allows for
alternative measurement modes. For instance, polymers that are electrophoretically
inserted in the nanopore can be studied under the application of only
a very weak bias, and their escape can be studied in the absence of
any bias, all without any loss of signal. Alternatively, this sensing
technique can be used to study thermophoretically or pressure driven
polymer translocations, omitting an electrical bias all together.
Finally, this detection scheme will aid the development of plasmonic
nanopores as a platform for label-free nanotweezing and single-molecule
Raman spectroscopy.

Methods
Sample Fabrication
Inverted-bowtie nanoapertures are
fabricated using electron-beam lithography. First, a trilayer stack
of (from substrate to top) PMGI/MMA-MAA copolymer/PMMA is spin-coated
at 400 nm/1000 nm/100 nm thickness on a piece of a silicon wafer.
The multilayer stack is essential to allow the gold layer on top of
the stack to be stripped and the resulting gold flake to be handled.
The resist is patterned with an array of bowties at a dose of 2500
μC/cm2 using a 100 keV electron bundle from an electron-beam
pattern generator (EBPG5200, Raith) and developed in MIBK:IPA 1:3
for 1 min followed by a 15 s dip into MF321 to transfer the pattern
also to the PMGI layer. Next, 100 nm of gold is evaporated onto
the layers using an electron-beam evaporator (Temescal 2000) at a
rate of 3 Å/s, without the use of any adhesion layers. The MMA-MAA/PMMA/gold
flake is then stripped from the substrate by submerging the sample
in a 3% KOH solution for 15 min to dissolve the PMGI. Subsequently,
the MMA-MAA/PMMA is removed using acetone, and the flake is transferred
into an isopropyl alcohol solution. Using a wedging technique,49 the flake is picked up from the solution and
placed onto a freestanding SiN membrane. After drying, the flake is
sealed onto the sample by covering the edge of the gold flake with
PDMS. The sample is then cleaned in O2 plasma (50 W) for
1 h to prevent carbon contamination in the TEM chamber. Finally, a
TEM is used to select a suitable nanostructure, and a nanopore is
drilled in the feed gap of the nanoaperture.

Experimental Setup
Prior to the experiment, the sample
is rinsed in ethanol and ddH2O and cleaned in O2 plasma for 30 s (50 W). The sample is mounted in a custom-made PEEK
flow cell that allows the plasmonic nanopore to be illuminated and
the transmission light to be collected. Next, electrolyte, 2 M LiCl
buffered to pH 8 with 20 mM Tris and 2 mM EDTA, unless otherwise stated,
is flushed in. Current through the plasmonic nanopore is measured
using a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes and acquired using a Axopatch 200B
(Molecular Devices) and analog filtered at 100 kHz using a low-pass
4-pole Bessel filter. The laser (M9-A64-0200 laser-diode, Thorlabs)
is operated in constant injection-current mode and focused to a diffraction-limited
spot on the sample using a 60× 1.2 NA water-immersion objective
(Olympus) in an inverted microscope setup. The transmission light
is collected using a 10× 0.3 NA objective (Nikon) and projected
onto an Avalanche Photo Diode (APD410C/M, Thorlabs). Subsequently,
the position of the laser focus is aligned to the plasmonic nanopore
by scanning the membrane through the focus of the laser using a piezoelectric
positioning stage (MadCity Laboratories, Inc.) and maximizing the
current increase that is induced by plasmonic heating. Data acquisition
is performed using custom-made Labview software through a NI DAQ (NI
USB-6251, National Instruments) at a sampling rate of 200 kHz, where
both the current amplifier and photodiode are read-out simultaneously
to ensure synchronized signal acquisition.

Event Detection and Analysis
Event detection and analysis
is performed using Tranzalyser,50 a custom-made
MATLAB-based software package developed in our lab. All traces, both
electrical and optical, are low-pass filtered using a Gaussian filter
with a cutoff at 1 kHz for analysis. Event detection is done in both
channels by using a 5-sigma-threshold spike detection, using a baseline
and sigma value calculated from a moving average window of 30000 data
points for the electrical traces and 5000 data points for the optical
traces. For display purposes, electrical traces are low-pass filtered
using 1 kHz cutoff, and optical traces are band-pass filtered using
a 2-pole Butterworth filter between 4 Hz and 1 kHz.

FDTD Simulations
We use FDTD Solutions (Lumerical Solutions,
Inc., Canada) to model the optical properties of the inverted-bowtie
plasmonic nanoantennas. The inverted bowtie is modeled as a bowtie-shaped
aperture in a 100 nm thick gold film with a width of 160 nm, a side
length of 100 nm, a 20 nm gap, and a 30 nm-in-radius in-plane tip
rounding to resemble the fabricated structures. The antenna is positioned
on a 20 nm thin silicon-nitride membrane with a refractive index (RI)
of 2. The surrounding medium is modeled as water with a RI of 1.33.
Symmetry is used to reduce the computational time. The plasmonic aperture
is excited by a pulse from a total-field scattered-field source incident
normal to the gold surface and with the polarization in either the
longitudinal or the transverse mode. The fractional light transmission
through the nanostructure is calculated by integrating the far-field
power flux through a screen placed 350 nm below the membrane and normalized
to the total incident power at each frequency.

The optical response
of fabricated nanostructures is simulated by extracting the planar
geometry from a TEM image, using the image import function of the
FDTD Solutions program. The planar geometry is extruded 100 nm 
to model an aperture in the gold film. The optical response with and
without DNA inserted into the gap is calculated using the far-field
power flux, where the DNA molecule is simulated as a 200 nm long rod
of 2.2 nm in diameter and a refractive index of 2.5.41
