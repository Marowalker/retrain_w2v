Nanoscale
generation of individual photons in confined geometries
is an exciting research field aiming at exploiting localized electromagnetic
fields for light manipulation. One of the outstanding challenges of
photonic systems combining emitters with nanostructured media is the
selective channelling of photons emitted by embedded sources into
specific optical modes and their transport at distant locations in
integrated systems. Here, we show that soft-matter nanofibers, electrospun
with embedded emitters, combine subwavelength field localization and
large broadband near-field coupling with low propagation losses. By
momentum spectroscopy, we quantify the modal coupling efficiency identifying
the regime of single-mode coupling. These nanofibers do not rely on
resonant interactions, making them ideal for room-temperature operation,
and offer a scalable platform for future quantum information technology.

Light–matter
interaction
design in nanostructured optical environments has revolutionized the
nanoscale control of light emission, absorption, and transport. Exerting
such control on single-photons generated by individual emitters is
also a fundamental step toward integrated quantum technologies, with
applications including single-photon transistors,1,2 on-chip
generation and routing of single photons,3−5 quantum interference,6,7 or long-range coupling of single emitters.8

In this framework, plasmonic systems, which exploit near-field
interactions in narrow gaps or nanosized resonators,9,10 have attracted much attention for broad-band and room temperature
operation: plasmonic nanoantennas can increase the directionality11 and decay-rate12,13 of single-photon
sources, whereas the emitted photons can be transported to distant
locations by plasmon modes in metal nanowires,14 wedges,15 or V-groove metal
surfaces.16

Inspired by plasmonic
architectures, subwavelength dielectric nanostructures
are emerging as candidate materials for light management at room-temperature.
Unlike photonic crystals, which exploit long-range interference (over
many wavelengths) to design narrow resonance modes, subwavelength
dielectrics offer practical local field enhancements and the ability
of near-field light manipulation with the advantage of being free
of the metal optical losses.17−19

Indeed, these waveguides
can channel and transport light from a
single emitter across long distances with relatively low losses, realizing
a simple interface between light emitters and propagating modes,20 increasing off-chip extraction efficiency with
diamond nanowires21 and semiconductor nanopillars.22,23 Moreover, the interaction of an emitter with a subwavelength waveguide
allows for the exploitation of unique phenomena, such as spin–orbit
coupling and unidirectional emission, which occurs only when light
is spatially confined.24,25

Polymer subwavelength waveguides
fabricated by self-assembly, drawn
from polymer solutions and melts,26 are
a promising system compatible with integration of quantum dots or
molecules as emitters, and with potential for scalability and interconnection
to form networks in 2-dimensions27 and
3-dimensions.28 This improves on conventional
pulled silica fibers with emitters evanescently coupled on the nanofiber
surface5,29 and on pulled capillary hosting single molecules.30 Moreover, these waveguides are cavity-free and
with a broadband response, which makes them ideal for room-temperature
(where sources are broadband) and ultrafast operation and for further
interfacing with biological matter.

Although polymer nanofibers
do not require nanolithography or top-down
nanofabrication to be realized, the emitter-waveguide coupling has
to be assessed a posteriori. In this respect, characterizing
the different modal contributions is important for further optical
engineering of the propagation and coupling properties, and for quantum
applications. The coupling efficiency can be probed from the collected
scattered and transmitted light when the waveguide terminals are accessible,5,29 by measuring the excitation extinction,30 or when coupling to strong resonances from indirect estimations,
such as those drawn from the lifetime variations of on- and off-coupling.18,31 To date, quantifying the coupling efficiency of a single emitter
to a specific nanofiber mode, in a way valid also for subwavelength
and weakly resonant modes, is an outstanding challenge.

Here,
we report broadband single-photon generation and transport
from isolated quantum dots embedded in the core of a free-standing
and subwavelength polymer nanofiber. By means of momentum spectroscopy,
we record the full k-vector distribution of the light
emitted by individual quantum dots, revealing the selective coupling
of the different dipole orientations to the individual nanofiber modes.
We find a coupling to the fundamental mode with values up to β01 = (31 ± 2)% which compare well with the theoretical
maximum coupling of β01 = 53%.

Results and Discussion
The hybrid nanofiber-emitter system is designed for (i) maximal
coupling, by embedding the emitter at the nanofiber core, and (ii)
efficient long-range transport, which is achieved by a free-standing
geometry. The nanofibers are fabricated by electrospinning a polymethylmetacrylate
(PMMA) solution (see Methods) doped with CdSeTe
colloidal quantum dots (Invitrogen QD800, emission peaked at 790 nm).
Unlike electron-beam or focused ion-beam lithography, the electrospinning
process largely preserves the integrity of embedded organic and inorganic
light emitters.26 Doped fibers with
a diameter (D) between 300 and 1000 nm, depending
on the processing parameters, are deposited either (i) on a glass
substrate or (ii) on a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid
producing free-standing nanostructures, with a circular cross section
and length of tens to hundreds of micrometers with isolated quantum
dots. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical free-standing
nanofiber is shown in Figure 1a. When illuminated with a red laser (632 nm), the emitters
can be located via wide-field fluorescence imaging, as in Figure 1b. The emission dynamics
is studied by confocal microscopy (numerical aperture, NA = 0.95)
and time correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). Hanbury Brown
and Twiss interferometry of the quantum dots in free-standing nanofibers
using two avalanche photodiode (APD) in start–stop configuration
is shown in Figure 1c. The intensity correlation function g2(t) measured under continuous wave (CW) excitation
(power 12 μW, wavelength 633 nm) is fitted to g2(t) = A(1 –
(1/N)exp(|t|/τ′)),
which gives a second-order intensity correlation function at zero-time, g2(0) = 0.10 ± 0.03, and a corresponding
decay-time τ′ = (84 ± 3) ns, which confirms single-photon
emission. The excited state lifetime for the quantum dot is measured
under picosecond pulsed excitation (average power 1.5 μW, repetition
rate 2.5 MHz, wavelength 634 nm). In the specific case shown in Figure 1d, a single exponential
fit gives a decay time τ = (137 ± 0.1) ns. The difference
between τ and τ′ can be explained via an incoherent
repumping term R, with τ′ = ((1/τ)
+ R)−1, as in ref (32). Fluorescence lifetime
statistics of individual quantum dots inside free-standing nanofibers
show a decay rate reduction of ∼25% as compared to a reference
homogeneous polymer film, in agreement with the theoretical prediction
(Supporting Information Figure S1). The
decay rate of an emitter inside a subwavelength nanofiber is expected
to be weakly reduced, due to the low refractive index of PMMA (nPMMA = 1.49, see Supporting Information Figure S1). Light collected from the nanofiber-coupled quantum
dots has a typical blinking behavior with an off state of 300 counts/s
(Figure 1e).

picture of a free-standing nanofiber. (b) Wide-field fluorescence
image of a similar nanofiber highlighting the presence of isolated
quantum dots (dashed square). (c) The discrete nature of the photons
emitted by the single quantum dot is evidenced by the second order
correlation function, obtained via continuous-wave laser excitation
(12 μW, 633 nm) which leads to g2 (0) = 0.1 ±
0.03 when fitted with g2(t) = A(1 – (1/N) exp(|t|/τ′)).
(d) The fluorescence dynamics of the same quantum dot under picosecond
excitation (1.5 μW, 2.5 MHz, 634 nm) is fitted with a single
exponential decay leading to an excited state lifetime τ = (137
± 0.1) ns. (e) The time trace of the photons emitted by the quantum
dot shows a blinking behavior with on- (∼10.5 kcounts/s) and
off- (∼0.3 kcounts/s) states as highlighted in the histogram.

For a quantum dot in the nanofiber,
the quantum dot saturation
intensity is 7 kW cm−2, achieved at an average pump
intensity of 0.5 μW in a diffraction-limited illumination area
(air objective, NA = 0.95), for which we have measured 38 kphotons/s
emitted, with an expected maximum count-rate (S∞) of 42 kphotons/s (see Supporting Information Figure S2). Above saturation the quantum dot approaches one
photon emitted per excitation pulse, that is, 2.5 Mphotons/s, given
our laser repetition rate of 2.5 MHz, limited by the less than unitary
quantum efficiency (∼0.7, as provided by the manufacturer,
Invitrogen) and by the off-states of the quantum dot (∼30%
on-state due to blinking) to a value of ∼0.5 Mphotons/s.

Momentum spectroscopy of the emitted light directly accesses the
coupling of the emitter to the nanofiber modes and allows us to calculate
the modal coupling in an original way, without measuring the light
transported by the nanofiber. Here, we apply Fourier patterns analysis
which is emerging as a reliable quantitative tool to probe otherwise
inaccessible information about the emitter33 and its emission directionality.11 We
measure the
light emitted in momentum space by recording the angular patterns
of the radiation emerging from a quantum dot inside a nanofiber lying
on glass. Index matching enables access to large angles, up to the
1.45 numerical aperture (NA) of our objective, which encompasses the
wave-vectors of the guided modes beyond the air light-line. We collect
Fourier patterns as shown in Figure 2a and b for two nanofibers: a thin one, in the single
mode regime (D/λ = 0.5, Figure 2a) and a thick one, in the multimode regime
(D/λ = 0.9, Figure 2b). Each pair of momenta lobes (positive
and negative kx where x is the direction of the longitudinal axis of the nanofiber) beyond
the air light-line (|kx| > 1), elongated in a direction orthogonal to the nanofiber,
is
the k-vector distribution of the distinct nanofiber
modes. This is a clear experimental signature of the individual coupling
of the quantum dot to each of the nanofiber modes, which is in very
good agreement with the calculated Fourier patterns shown in Figure 2c and d.

of the coupling of a dipole to the modes of the nanofiber obtained
from the angular emission patterns of a longitudinal (blue) and transverse
(red) dipole located at the center of the nanofiber, normalized to
the maximum coupling (see Supporting Informations). The light line in air and in the polymer is indicated by the black
lines, delimiting the region with guided modes. Inside the air light-cone,
the light corresponds to uncoupled emission and is therefore similar
for both dipolar orientations. Instead, the emission for k-vectors
beyond the air light line can couple to the nanofiber modes (high
intensity red and blue bands). The emission maxima correspond to the
dispersion of the two nanofiber modes, proving that for reasons of
symmetry the transverse dipole couples exclusively to the LP01, and the longitudinal dipole to LP11. The analytical
dispersion relation of the first two modes of the nanofiber in air
(LP01 and LP11) are plotted as white dotted
lines.

Figure 2e plots
the mode dispersion structure reconstructed from the calculated angular
pattern of a dipolar source in the center of a nanofiber (see Methods). The intensity map indicates the coupling
strength of a longitudinal (blue) and transverse (red) dipole to the
nanofiber, normalized to unity, which is the maximal value in the
plot. The guided modes are visible as two lines that stem from the
air light-line ω = c0kx growing to larger k-vectors up to the polymer light-line ω = c0kx/n, where ω is the light frequency, c0 the speed of light in vacuum, and n the refractive index. Because of the different spatial symmetry
of the modes, the transverse (red) dipole couples almost exclusively
to the fundamental mode LP01, and the longitudinal (blue) to the second higher mode LP11. Instead, the light emitted inside the light cone in air
(ω > c0kx) corresponds to uncoupled radiation, emitted
into
free-space modes. We confirm this selective coupling and the nature
of the modes by superimposing the analytical solution (dashed white
lines) of the dispersion relations of the modes for a free-standing
nanofiber.34 The analytical solution matches
the maxima of the coupling of the two dipole-orientations which confirms
that the strength of the momenta peak is a direct measure of the coupling
of the emitter to a specific wave-vector, that is, to a specific nanofiber
mode.

Coupling of an emitter to the propagating waveguide modes
is required
for transport and manipulation of the emitted single photons. Plasmonic
nanostructures can offer very high coupling efficiencies, as high
as 21% for silver nanowires14 or 42% for
V-groove
channels,16 although propagation of coupled
photons is limited by the strong Ohmic losses in the metal. Instead,
dielectrics can offer much longer propagation length at the price
of a weaker coupling, which has been measured at room-temperature
to reach ∼30% for quantum dots outside a silica nanofiber,
approaching experimentally5,29 the theoretical limit
imposed by evanescence coupling.35 Higher
values,
close to 100%, can be reached at cryogenic conditions for the coupling
of epitaxial quantum dots to photonic crystal waveguides31 although this is limited to narrow-band resonance,
or ∼18% for single molecules inside a broadband pulled glass
capillary.30

Here, we developed
a different technique based on the momentum
spectroscopy of the emitted light; from the ratio of the coupled and
uncoupled light, the total coupling constant β as well as the
coupling to the fundamental mode β01 can be estimated.
The coupling efficiency β is obtained as the ratio between the
light emitted into the guided modes region (|kx| > 1) and the total emitted light β
= I(|kx| > 1)/I, whereas β01 is the
ratio
between the intensity of the k-vector corresponding to the mode LP01 and the total emitted light (see Methods). The obtained coupling values are shown in Figure 3, where the lines represent the theoretical
predictions and the points indicate the experimental data. Although
the total coupling β remains roughly constant for all diameters
(see Supporting Information Figure S3),
the theoretical coupling β01 to the fundamental mode
(red line in Figure 3) reaches its maximum value of β01 = 53% at D/λ = 0.55, and then drops for larger diameters as
more modes become available. The measured coupling values (green bars
in Figure 3) are in
the range β01 = (21 ± 4)% – (31 ±
2)% for single mode nanofibers, and β01 = (5 ±
1)% – (15 ± 1)% for multimode nanofibers, where also the
coupling to the second higher mode LP11 increases (orange
bars in Figure 3).
The errors come from the uncertainty in the position of the peaks
in the k-space. The accuracy of this estimation can
be confirmed by FDTD calculations that show an agreement within 10%
between the values of β obtained from the two methods of momentum
spectroscopy and direct modal coupling (see Supporting Information and Figure S4). As expected, the experimental values
are lower than the theoretical prediction for a transverse or longitudinal
dipole, as the quantum dot’s dipole moment is randomly oriented
in the experiments. These findings confirm that large single mode
coupling can only be achieved with subwavelength nanofibers. The momentum
spectroscopy method here developed is also ideal for probing nanofibers
with more complex modes, as for example periodically corrugated nanofibers,36 where the induced bandgaps would be evident
in the dispersion relation.

of the emitter–nanofiber coupling via momentum spectroscopy.
The experimental values for the coupling to the fundamental mode LP01 are plotted as circular green points (and green bar). In
the multimode region (gray shaded area), coupling to the second higher
mode LP11 are shown by an orange bar and the total coupling
is marked by orange squares. The experimental values are compared
to the theoretical calculations for the two dipole-orientations (red
line for transverse, and blue line for longitudinal). The coupling
to the fundamental mode β01 quickly drops for D ≥ 0.7λ due to the emergence of other modes.
The error bars originate from the uncertainty in the position of the
peaks in the k-space.

When the nanofiber is intentionally doped with many quantum
dots,
their fluorescence at location distant from the illumination spot
is a direct evidence of transport of the exciting laser light through
the nanofiber, as shown in Figure 4a, which shows quantum dots excited as far as 60 μm
from the laser spot. The granularity of the quantum dot doping prevents
a quantitative estimation of the propagation length, which instead
can be done by recording how the fluorescence intensity leaks from
a nanofibers homogeneously doped with a near-infrared dye, as shown
in Figure 4b. By fitting
with an exponential model the leaked light, we obtain an optical loss
coefficient ξ–1 = (105 ± 5) cm–1, corresponding to a propagation length ξ = (95 ± 5) μm.
Both the nanofiber scattering and the dye reabsorption (∼58
cm–1, from bulk absorption measurements) are involved
in determining the resulting ξ value. Theoretically, for a nanofiber
in air we expect a propagation length of 100–1000 μm,
as calculated by including Rayleigh scattering from the nanofiber
surface roughness (a few nanometers)37 as
measured by atomic force microscopy.

Figure 4 Light transport through the nanofiber.
Panel (a) shows a nanofiber
with an intentional high-density of quantum dots when remotely excited.
The excitation position is outside the field of view. The laser beam
couples to the nanofiber and is transported through it, which is revealed
by the quantum dots excited distant locations. (b) More quantitative
measure of the transport length can be obtained by exciting a nanofiber
doped with an IR dye emitting around 890 nm. The excitation is 20
μm outside the field of view. The fluorescence intensity recorded
along the nanofiber is fitted with and an exponential function [Aexp(−x/ξ)] after subtracting
the background, obtaining a propagation length of ξ = (95 ±
5) μm.

As both long propagation
and large coupling are important criteria
to assess the quality of an hybrid nanoscale architecture, the most
recent figure of merit (FOM) introduced by Bermúdez-Ureña
et al.16 combines them in the product (β P ξ)/λ, of mode coupling (β),
Purcell factor (P), and propagation length (ξ)
normalized by free-space operating wavelength (λ). We suggest
here that β is replaced by the modal coupling, that is, β01 for the fundamental mode, which has more practical importance
for single-mode operation. The state-of-the-art in plasmonic systems
is reported to be FOM = 6.6 ± 23%, whereas for our dielectric
nanofibers, we can calculate a FOM of 44 ± 16% coming from a
coupling of β01 = (31 ± 2)% and a Purcell factor
with respect to vacuum of 1.2 ± 15% and the propagation length
ξ = (95 ± 5) μm. Although plasmonic systems can strongly
engineer the Purcell factor, dielectric nanostructures, with negligible
Ohmic losses, offer longer propagation lengths, resulting in a large
FOM. This FOM is useful to compare nanoscale geometries, whereas it
loses importance for macroscopic systems such as conventional single
mode fibers for which the very long propagation length dominates the
FOM.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report on a nanofiber single-photon
light source
architecture, integrating a quantum emitter into a low loss single
mode optical waveguide and operating at room temperature. Using an
approach based on momentum spectroscopy, we have quantified the coupling
efficiency of individual quantum dots to each nanofiber mode, obtaining
broadband coupling of up to 31% of the emitted light (see also Supporting Information Figure S5) and a FOM of
44 ± 16%. Through their robustness and flexibility, these nanofibers
have potential as a future platform for nanoscale quantum optics as
they can be connected to form a network of coupled emitters for quantum
technological applications. Moreover, these systems are compatible
with plasmonic systems, and therefore suitable for further photonic
engineering.

Methods
Nanofibers
Fabrication
One nM solution containing CdSeTe
quantum dots (Invitrogen QD800, emitting at 790 nm) was mixed with
a chloroform solution of PMMA (MW 120 000, Sigma-Aldrich).
In order to obtain submicron fibers, 30 mg of tetrabutylammonium iodide
organic salt was added to the solution. By measuring the emission
spectrum of the quantum dots, we checked that the solvent, polymer
matrix, and organic salt do not affect the photoluminescence properties
of the embedded emitters. The background fluorescence from PMMA is
estimated to be <1% of the emission from the QD, as determined
both by measuring the background fluorescence collected from the excited
spot and by exciting 10 μm away from the edge of an intentionally
cut nanofiber and collecting at the edge (see Supporting Information Figure S5). For light transport measurements,
the IR-140 organic chromophore was added to the PMMA solution, using
a concentration of 0.1% weight:weight relative to the PMMA polymer
matrix. The solution was loaded in a 1 mL syringe tipped with a 27G
gauge stainless steel needle and delivered at 0.5 mL h–1 constant rate by means of a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston,
MA). A bias voltage of 8 kV was applied between the needle and the
metallic collector by a high voltage power supply (Glassman High Voltage).
Glass coverslip substrates (18 × 18 mm2) were placed
on a 10 × 10 cm2 Cu plate used as grounded collector,
positioned 10 cm away from the needle. Free-standing nanofibers were
obtained by deposition on a TEM grid (TAAB Laboratories Equipment
Ltd.) used as collector. Electrospinning was performed with a relative
humidity and temperature of about 40% and 25 °C, respectively.
Reference thin films on glass coverslip substrates were obtained by
spin-coating the solution used for electrospinning at 6000 rpm for
40 s. The nanofiber morphology was investigated by SEM (FEI Nova NanoSEM
450 or Zeiss) and atomic force microscopy (Veeco Instruments). The
fiber diameters were in the range of 300−1000 nm, with a surface
roughness (root-mean-square, RMS) of the order of few nm. The fibers
have almost a round-shaped cross section (Figure S6a,b), with a ratio between the height and the width in the
range 0.9–1. A maximum variation of 70 nm of the fiber diameter
over a length of 1 mm was measured (Figure S6c–h).

Confocal Optical Microscopy
The excited state lifetime
of isolated quantum dots was measured by confocal microscopy and TCSPC
(TimeHarp 260, PicoQuant) with an overall temporal resolution of ∼100–200
ps. The quantum dots were excited with a 100 ps, 634 nm, 2.5 MHz repetition
rate laser (average power 1.5 μW) through an air objective (NA
= 0.95) or an oil immersion objective (NA = 1.45). The light emitted
was collected by the same objective and directed to an avalanche photodiode
(APD). The lifetime traces were fitted with both a single exponential
and a log-normal model, and the one providing the highest accuracy
was retained. Antibunching was measured through the same setup, but
using two APDs in start–stop configuration. The intensity correlation
function g2(t) measured
from a quantum dot under CW excitation was fitted to g2(t) = A(1 –
(1/N) exp(|t|/τ′)).
The collection efficiency of our microscope is estimated to be ∼5%
for polymer films and 1.45 NA oil immersion objective and ∼2–3%
for free-standing fibers and 0.95 NA air objective. These values are
obtained as the ratios between the measured saturation intensity of
several individual QDs and the expected emission intensity at saturation
(laser repetition rate times the quantum efficiency).5

Optical Fourier Imaging
We recorded
the angular emission
patterns I(kx, ky) of isolated
quantum dots by imaging the back-focal plane into a CCD camera (Princeton
Instruments, Pixis 400). The excitation and collection was achieved
through an oil immersion objective (100×, NA = 1.45). We calculated
the intensity distribution I(kx) = ΣkyI(kx, ky), where kx is the component
of k⃗ along the nanofiber axis. We estimated
the nanofiber diameter D by comparing the position
of the peaks in the experimental Fourier patterns with the theoretical
modal dispersion. As the nanofiber modes are only marginally affected
by the glass interface, the light emitted in the k-regions beyond the light-cone in air corresponds to guided modes
(|kx| > 1), and the
light
inside the light cone in air to the uncoupled modes. For multimodal
fibers, owing to the modes’ orthogonality in k-space, different modes have different wave vectors for the same
energy; this allows assessing the individual coupling to these modes
by measuring the relative strength of the Fourier peaks. In this way,
the coupling to the fundamental mode β01 can be separated
from the total coupling β to all the waveguide modes.

The coupling efficiency β is obtained as the ratio between
the light emitted into the guided modes region (|kx| > 1) and the total emitted light  while β01 is the ratio between
the intensity of the k-vector corresponding to the
mode LP01 and the total emitted light. This can be generalized
for all other higher-energy modes.

An uncertainty is attributed
to both D and β
due to the uncertainty in the k-space calibration
that we quantify as 0.05. The accuracy of this estimation can be confirmed
by finite difference time domain (FDTD) calculations that show an
agreement within 10% between the values of β obtained from the
two methods of momentum spectroscopy and direct modal coupling (See Supporting Information Figure S4).

Numerical
Calculations
FDTD simulations were performed
using a commercial package (Lumerical). The local density of optical
states (LDOS) maps were obtained by considering the intensity emitted
by a dipolar source in different position inside the nanofiber. The
total coupling efficiency was obtained by calculating the intensity
transmitted through a monitor crossing the free-standing nanofiber
4 μm away from the source; the modal coupling efficiency was
obtained by mode projection of the same intensity onto the independently
calculated nanofibers modes. The angular patterns were obtained by
means of far field projections of the electromagnetic fields in a
plane 300 nm outside the nanofiber inside the substrate of a nanofiber
laying on glass. Calculations with and without the glass substrate
show that the low-refractive index interface below the nanofiber only
weakly affects the modal dispersion, inducing only a spectral broadening
due to the increased losses into the glass.
