Carrier
multiplication (CM) is a process in which a single photon
excites two or more electrons. CM is of interest to enhance the efficiency
of a solar cell. Until now, CM in thin films and solar cells of semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) has been found at photon energies well above the
minimum required energy of twice the band gap. The high threshold
of CM strongly limits the benefits for solar cell applications. We
show that CM is more efficient in a percolative network of directly
connected PbSe NCs. The CM threshold is at twice the band gap and
increases in a steplike fashion with photon energy. A lower CM efficiency
is found for a solid of weaker coupled NCs. This demonstrates that
the coupling between NCs strongly affects the CM efficiency. According
to device simulations, the measured CM efficiency would significantly
enhance the power conversion efficiency of a solar cell.

==== Body
Photoexcitation
of an electron
in a semiconductor produces an electron–hole (e–h) pair
with excess energy equal to the difference of the photon energy and
the band gap. The electron and hole can release their excess energy
in the form of heat via phonon emission. A charge
with excess energy greater than the band gap can also relax by exciting
another electron across the band gap. This process of carrier multiplication
(CM) leads to generation of multiple e–h pairs per absorbed
photon. CM is of great interest to enhance the photocurrent produced
in a photovoltaic device.1−6 In this context, lead chalcogenide nanomaterials have received particular
attention because their band gap can be tuned to values near 1 eV,
which is optimal for exploitation of CM in solar cells. The occurrence
of CM has been observed in lead chalcogenide quantum dots in dispersion7−9 and thin film solids,6,10,11 nanorods,2,12−14 nanosheets,15 and bulk.16

For device applications, the charges produced via CM must be sufficiently mobile to prevent Auger recombination and
to enable their extraction at external electrodes. Charge mobilities
in the range of 1–40 cm2 V–1 s–1 have been found for thin film solids of PbSe nanocrystals
(NCs) that are connected by short organic ligands.11,17,18 Interestingly, a PbSe NC solid with 1,2-ethanediamine
ligands has shown a lower threshold for CM than for the same NCs in
dispersion.8,11 In this PbSe NC solid, the NCs
are to some extent also coupled directly by thin atomic necks.19 Hence, electronic coupling appears not only
to be beneficial to charge mobility but also to reduce the threshold
energy of CM. The coupling has been further enhanced by facet-specific
oriented attachment of NCs.20−23 In the latter case, further thermal annealing of
the formed superlattice results in the formation of a percolative
PbSe network, in which the NCs are connected via strong
crystalline bridges in the in-plane directions. There are, on average,
less than four connections per nanocrystal in this system. The percolative
network can hence be considered as a planar system with a dimensionality
between 2 and 1 with straight segments in orthogonal directions (see Figure 1A). The short-range
mobility of charge carriers was found to attain values as high as 260 cm2 V–1 s–1 for a probing electric field oscillating in
the terahertz (THz) frequency range.23 Note
that the mobility in bulk PbSe is a few times higher than this value.
The low band gap of a bulk PbSe crystal makes it, however, unsuitable
for solar cell applications.3,4,16

The aim of the current work is to determine to what extent
the
enhanced electronic coupling in percolative PbSe networks affects
the CM threshold energy and efficiency in addition to the beneficial
effect on charge mobility already reported in ref (23). We studied the quantum
yield for charge carrier photogeneration in percolative PbSe networks
and a PbSe NC solid, using optical-pump THz-probe (OPTP) time-domain
spectroscopy. We found that CM in percolative PbSe networks has lower
threshold energy and is more efficient than in films of PbSe NCs coupled
by organic ligands.11 Interestingly, the
CM efficiency follows a steplike dependence on photon energy and reaches
a value of about 1.4 at the minimum required photon energy of twice
the band gap. According to detailed-balance calculations, the CM efficiency
realized in the percolative PbSe network would enhance the power conversion
efficiency of a solar cell by ∼8% over the Shockley–Queisser
limit for a band gap of 0.7 eV at 1 sun. The results have great promise
for development of highly efficient third-generation solar cells.

Results
and Discussion
Structure and Optical Absorption of a Percolative
PbSe Network
and PbSe NC Solid
We studied CM in planar percolative PbSe
networks with structure such as that shown in the transmission electron
microscope (TEM) image of Figure 1A (see Methods). Such networks
have a thickness of 5.8 nm, which is equal to the diameter of the
NCs from which they were prepared.20,23 Similar to
our previous work, the center-to-center distance between the NCs in
the plane of the network is 6.4 ± 0.1 nm. The NCs are connected
by crystalline necks with a thickness of 4.0 ± 0.4 nm and an
average of 2.6 ± 0.7 necks per NC.23 The entire percolative system thus forms a planar single rocksalt
PbSe crystal with the [100] crystal axes being the principal axes.
The attached NCs form straight segments with average length of about
20 nm. For comparison, we also studied a thin film solid of PbSe NCs
connected by 1,2-ethanediamine ligands with cubic ordering to some
extent and relatively thin atomic necks between part of the NCs (see Methods).19 The NC solid
has a thickness of about 55 ± 10 nm corresponding to 10 layers
of NCs. Figure 1B shows
a TEM image of a NC solid. It exhibits relatively thin necks between
part of the NCs, and it is more disordered than the percolative network.
More details about the structure of such a NC solid can be found in
refs (18) and (19).

Figure 1C shows that the optical absorption
spectra of the percolative PbSe network, and the NC solid shows a
broadened peak around 0.70 ± 0.01 eV. This peak is slightly red-shifted
from the first excitonic transition of PbSe NCs dispersed in tetrachloroethylene
(see Figure 1C). This
can be attributed to the electronic coupling between NCs in the percolative
network and the solid.23 Photoluminescence
from the percolative network and the NC solid could not be detected
(see Methods), which implies that electrons
and holes recombine predominantly nonradiatively. In what follows,
we take the energy of the peak absorption maximum as the band gap
of the material (i.e., Eg = 0.70 eV). For the percolative network, the tail at the low-energy
side is less broad than for the NC solid. This may be due to the more
ordered structure of the network and the smaller number of connections
to other NCs in the two-dimensional network, as compared to the NC
solid (see Figure 1A,B).

THz Conductivity and Quantum Yield of Charge Carrier Photogeneration
Figure 2 shows THz
conductivity signals, S(t) (see Methods), for the percolative PbSe network and the
NC solid after excitation with pump photon energies of 1.08 and 0.77
eV, respectively. These photon energies are below twice the band gap
so that CM cannot occur. According to our previous studies, photoexcitation
of these samples does not lead to a significant yield of neutral excitons,
and therefore, the quantum yield of charge carriers can be considered
equal to one (i.e., ϕ = 1; see eqs 1 and 2 in Methods).18,23 The THz conductivity
signal is directly proportional to the sum of the time-dependent density
of electrons and holes weighted by their mobility. The ∼2 ps
rise time of the THz conductivity signals in Figure 2 reflects the duration of the THz waveform.
After the initial rise, S(t) is
merely constant up to 2.5 ps for all pump fluences, so that charge
trapping or recombination is insignificant and the survival fractions
of electrons and holes are equal to 1; that is, fe(t) = fh(t) = 1 for t < 2.5 ps; see eq 1 in Methods. In agreement with this, the initial THz conductivity signal S0 (obtained by averaging S(t) between 2.0 and 2.5 ps; see Methods) increases linearly with pump fluence; see the insets in Figure 2A,B. For up to at
least 6 ps, the decay kinetics of the THz conductivity was found to
be independent of pump photon energy, hν (see Supplementary Figure S1), from which we infer
that cooling of charge carriers from higher energy to the band edge
is so fast that it does not affect the decay kinetics monitored in
this experiment. This agrees with charge cooling times less than 2
ps reported for PbSe NCs before.24,25 On a longer
time scale on the order of 100 ps, the charges decay by trapping or
recombination, as discussed before.23

Figure 2 THz conductivity
signal for different pump fluences. (A) THz conductivity
signal induced by excitation of the percolative PbSe network at photon
energy of 1.08 eV. (B) THz conductivity signal induced by excitation
of the PbSe NC solid at photon energy 0.77 eV.

The sum of the electron and hole mobilities, μe + μh, obtained from the data in Figure 2A for the percolative
PbSe
network is found to be 270 ± 10 cm2 V–1 s–1, which is close to previous results.23 For the PbSe NC solid, the sum of the electron
and hole mobilities obtained from the data in Figure 2B is 94 ± 4 cm2 V–1 s–1. This value is higher than that reported by
Guglietta et al.,17 which
is due to the fact that we used a higher refractive index for PbSe
(see Methods) and could in addition result
from preparing the NC solid via layer-by-layer dip-coating
rather than spin-coating. The larger electronic coupling due to the
broad crystalline necks between the NCs in the percolative PbSe network
causes the mobility to be higher than that in the NC solid, despite
the smaller dimension of the network, between 2 and 1.

Determination
of Carrier Multiplication Efficiency
The CM efficiency was
determined from measurements of the initial
THz conductivity signal S0 for different
pump photon energies, hν, as a function of
pump fluence, Na, analogous to the data
in the insets in Figure 2. A similar approach has been used previously to determine the CM
efficiency in PbS nanosheets and in bulk PbS and PbSe.15,16Figure 3A shows that
the slope of S0versusNa for the percolative PbSe network
is the same for photon energies up to 1.30 eV (i.e., below 2Eg = 1.40 eV). This is to be
expected because, at these energies, the quantum yield ϕ = 1.
The slope exhibits increased values for photon energies of 1.55 eV
and higher (i.e., above 2Eg), which is due to a higher quantum yield as a result of CM. We determine
the slope corresponding with unity quantum yield by averaging the
slopes in plots of S0versusNa for photon energies less than twice
the band gap. The quantum yield at higher photon energies is then
obtained from the relative values of the slopes. The quantum yields
for the percolative PbSe network and the PbSe NC solid were obtained
from linear fits to the measured values of S0versusNa, shown
in Supplementary Figure S2. In Figure 3B, we show the quantum
yield as a function of photon energy, hν (top
axis), and as a function of photon energy normalized to the band gap, hν/Eg (bottom axis).

(A) Initial THz conductivity of the percolative PbSe network versus absorbed pump fluence for photon energies as indicated.
(B) Quantum yield as a function of band gap multiple (hν/Eg, bottom axis) and as a function
of photon energy (hν, top axis) for the percolative
PbSe network and the PbSe NC solid. The standard deviation in the
quantum yields, as obtained from linear fits to experimental data
as in panel A (and Supplementary Figure S2), is smaller than the data points.

Interestingly, Figure 3B shows that the onset of CM is near twice the band gap for
both the percolative PbSe network and the PbSe NC solid. In addition,
distinct steplike features appear in the quantum yield for the percolative
network with plateaus at photon energies in the range of 1.5–2.0
eV (2.1Eg – 2.9Eg) and 2.0–2.6 eV (2.9Eg – 3.7Eg). At higher energies,
the CM efficiency increases linearly. These characteristics of the
CM efficiency were reproduced for a second percolative PbSe network
(see Supplementary Figure S3). The PbSe
NC solid exhibits a lower quantum yield with plateaus in the range
of 1.5–1.9 eV and 2.0–2.4 eV.

Discussion of Carrier Multiplication
Efficiency
Ideal
staircase CM with the quantum yield increasing by one for each band
gap multiple of the excess photon energy has been found for single-walled
carbon nanotubes.26 Such staircase behavior
has also been reported for silicon nanocrystals embedded in a silicon
dioxide matrix.27 However, in the latter
case, the nanocrystals were not coupled, preventing charge transport
and solar cell applications. The percolative network and the NC solid
of the present study combine steplike CM with onset at twice the band
gap with high charge mobility.

For lead chalcogenide NCs in
dispersion, the CM onset is at almost three times the band gap, and
steplike features have not been reported.9,14 Interestingly,
the CM onset in lead chalcogenide nanorods is lower than that for
NCs in dispersion, with the lowest reported threshold energy being
2.23Eg.12,14 Our percolative PbSe network is a planar crystal that can, somehow,
be considered as a system of small NC rods of variable length (on
average, several PbSe NCs long) oriented and connected in two orthogonal
[100] directions (see Figure 1A). This appears to reduce the CM threshold energy to the
absolute minimum of twice the band gap and leads to steplike features.
CM at twice the band gap implies that the photon energy in excess
of the band gap is fully converted into kinetic energy of one type
of carrier only, either the photoexcited electron or the hole, as
shown in the lower panel of Figure 4. The plateaus in the quantum yield versus photon energy in Figure 3 can be due to fast cooling of the electron (or hole) from
higher energy in a series of electronic states to a lower state from
which CM takes place prior to further cooling. The fact that the quantum
yield does not increase up to 2.0 (see Figure 3) at photon energy of 2Eg can have different origins. First of all, it could be
that not all photon absorption processes result in a fully asymmetric
distribution of the photon energy; that is, they donate the excess
energy to one type of charge carrier only. Possibly, part of the photons
distribute their energy in excess of the band gap in a more symmetric
way over the electron and the hole, as indicated in the upper panel
of Figure 4. Second,
thermal decay from the level of the CM precursor state might be at
play. Interestingly, for PbS nanosheets, the CM threshold was found
to be at a much higher band gap multiple15 than for the percolative PbSe network of the present work. It appears
that the continuous nanosheets behave more like the bulk crystal in
which CM has a higher threshold energy due to restrictions imposed
by conservation of crystal momentum of the electrons involved in CM.
The weakening of the rock salt periodicity in three orthogonal directions
in the structure of a percolative network can relax these restrictions
in favor of CM.

Figure 4 Photoexcitation and charge relaxation pathways. Upper
panel: in
a fully symmetric excitation at photon energy of twice the band gap,
the excess energy is initially equally distributed between the electron
(blue dot) and the hole (red dot), which subsequently relax by cooling
to the band edges. Lower panel: in a fully asymmetric excitation,
the excess photon energy can be transferred to excite another electron via CM. In the example of this figure, the electron in the
second conduction band acquires the excess photon energy and subsequently
relaxes via CM.

Insight into the occurrence of asymmetric electronic excitations,
as shown in the lower panel of Figure 4, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations.
To this end, we considered a percolative network of 12 × 12 coupled
NCs taken from the TEM image in Figure 1A. Electronic states of this network were calculated
using k·p theory with a basis
set corresponding to the two highest valence band states and the two
lowest conduction band states at the L-point in the first Brillouin
zone of PbSe.28,29 This four band model did not
yield a significant amount of asymmetric electronic excitations. Apparently,
the electronic states resulting from mixing of the four band-edge
states in the percolative network are to a large extent still resembling
the almost symmetric energy dispersion of the valence and conduction
bands in bulk PbSe. Hence, the four band-edge states at the L-point
are insufficient to describe asymmetric excitations. A next step would
be to include states along the Σ-path in the first Brillouin
zone or states at higher energy at the L-point.25,30 It thus turns out that a proper description of CM in the percolative
networks requires a more advanced theoretical approach, such as k·p theory, with more electronic bands
or density functional theory with modern exchange/correlation functionals.

Enhancement of the Allowable Solar Cell Power Conversion Efficiency
Using the measured data in Figure 3B for the quantum yield versus band
gap multiple, we calculated the power conversion efficiency (PCE)
of a solar cell exposed to an AM1.5 solar spectrum using the detailied-balance
approach.31,32 All incident solar light at photon energy
above the band gap was assumed to be absorbed. The results are shown
in Figure 5, together
with the Shockley–Queisser limit and the ideal staircase behavior
of CM. The CM efficiency in the PbSe NC solid does not significantly
enhance the maximum PCE as compared to the Shockley–Queisser
limit. However, the CM efficiency measured for the percolative PbSe
network would enhance the maximum allowable PCE from ∼33% with
no CM to ∼37% for the percolative network, a net increase of
4% (red curve in Figure 5). At a fixed band gap, the increase in efficiency is greater. For
a band gap of 0.7 eV, the PCE increases from 24% without CM to 32%
for the measured CM in the percolative network, an increase of ∼8%.
Under concentration, the PCE of all solar cells increases; however,
when CM is present, the increase in PCE is much higher than that in
the case of no CM.3 At a concentration
of 500×, the CM measured in the percolative network increases
the PCE from 33 to 44% at 0.7 eV band gap.

efficiency of a solar cell exposed to an AM1.5 solar spectrum versus band gap for the percolative PbSe network and NC
solid, together with the Shockley–Queisser limit and the ideal
staircase behavior of CM. In the latter case, the quantum yield increases
by one each time the photon energy increases by an amount equal to
the band gap.

Note that the optical
absorption spectrum of the percolative network
in Figure 1C shows
a tail below the band gap. This will reduce the PCE with respect to
the calculated values given above.33 To
fully exploit CM, the networks should be improved to achieve a more
narrow tail.

Conclusions
In the percolative PbSe
network, the threshold photon energy for
CM to occur was found to be equal to the minimum value of twice the
band gap. At the threshold, the quantum yield of charge carriers was
found to increase to about 1.4 and to exhibit a plateau as a function
of photon energy. At higher photon energy, the quantum yield exhibits
a next steplike feature followed by a linear increase. Qualitatively
similar results were obtained for a NC solid with organic ligands
and thin atomic necks between part of the NCs. The PCE of a solar
cell would be enhanced significantly by the CM efficiency found for
the percolative PbSe network.

Methods
Sample Preparation
All samples were prepared and stored
in nitrogen atmosphere or under vacuum (for TEM) during measurements.

PbSe NCs with a diameter of 5.8 ± 0.4 nm passivated with oleic
acid surface ligands were synthesized according to the method of Steckel et al.(34) Two-dimensional percolative
PbSe networks were prepared by oriented attachment of the PbSe NCs,
as described previously.23 According to
TEM measurements, the NCs are connected by necks with a thickness
of 4.0 ± 0.4 nm with center-to-center distance of 6.4 ±
0.1 nm. The NC density in a network is 2.4 × 1012 cm–2. To enhance the absorbed pump laser fluence and consequently
the signal-to-noise ratio of the THz conductivity experiments, we
stacked six monolayers of percolative PbSe networks on a quartz substrate,
similar to our previous work.23 The presence
of long oleic acid ligands prevents electronic coupling between stacked
layers. Consequently, charge transport only occurs within the layers
and not from one layer to another. To get insight into the reproducibility
of the experiments, we studied two percolative networks that were
both prepared according to the procedure outlined above.

A PbSe
NC solid was prepared via layer-by-layer
dip-coating, using a DC multi-8 Nima Technology dip-coater.11,18 At first, a quartz substrate was dipped into a dispersion of PbSe
NCs with oleic acid ligands in hexane for 60 s. Subsequently, the
sample was dipped into a 0.4 M solution of 1,2-ethanediamine ligands
in methanol for 60 s for ligand exchange. Immediately after ligand
exchange, the film was washed with methanol for 60 s. The above procedure
was repeated 20 times to prepare a homogeneous film. The film has
a thickness of 55 ± 10 nm, as determined with a Veeco Dektak
8 step profilometer.

TEM Characterization
TEM images
and electron diffractograms
were obtained using a Philips CM30T microscope operating at 200 kV.

Optical Characterization
Optical absorption spectra
of the samples were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda spectrophotometer
equipped with an integrated sphere. Photoluminescence measurements
were performed using a nanosecond pulsed pump–probe laser setup
from Edinburgh Instruments (LP920) equipped with an InGaAs PIN photodiode
detector G5853-23.

Terahertz Photoconductivity Measurements
Charge carriers
were produced by excitation of the samples with optical pump pulses
at varying wavelength, and the resulting photoconductivity was detected
by time-domain THz spectroscopy,35,36 analogous
to our previous work.23 Pump pulses were
generated starting from a chirped-pulse amplified laser system (Mira-Libra,
Coherent Inc.), which runs at 1.4 kHz and delivers pulses of 60 fs
at 800 nm. Pump pulses (<100 fs) in the infrared and visible regions
were obtained from optical parametric amplification seeded by white
light (Topas-Coherent). A BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal
was used to generate pump pulses at 400 nm. Single-cycle THz waveforms
were generated by optical rectification in LiNbO3 and detected
in a ZnTe crystal by the electro-optic effect. A pinhole of 1.5 mm
diameter was placed on the samples to ensure photoexcitation and probing
of the same sample area during different experiments.

The photogeneration
quantum yield of charge carriers, ϕ, and decay kinetics of charge
carriers were obtained from the difference, ΔE(tp,t) = Eexcited(tp,t) – E0(tp), of the maximum amplitude of the THz electric field at time t after the optical pump pulse, Eexcited(tp,t), and the maximum
amplitude of the THz waveform at time tp after generation of the THz waveform, E0(tp), in the absence of the pump pulse.
The THz conductivity signal is then obtained according to37,38 1  In eq 1, the functions fe(t) (fh(t)) are the fractions of
electrons (holes) that have survived from
trapping or recombination, Na is the absorbed
pump photon fluence, c is the speed of light, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, neff is the effective refractive index in the THz frequency range, and e is the elementary charge. The value of neff was equal to 10.8, as inferred from the data in refs (23) and (39). The electron (hole) μe (μh) mobility in eq 1 is the real component due to the charge velocity
in-phase with the THz field and averaged over the frequencies contained
in the THz waveform (0.2–0.7 THz).

In our experiments,
the THz conductivity signal S(t)
was found to reach a maximum value at a pump
probe delay time near 2 ps (see Figure 2A) and to be merely constant up to 2.5 ps, so that fe(t) and fh(t) can be considered equal to unity
on this time scale. To reduce the noise level, the quantum yield was
obtained from S(t) averaged over
the time interval of 2.0–2.5 ps, which is denoted as the initial
THz conductivity 2  with A =
(μe + μh)e/2cε0neff. According
to eq 2, the quantum
yield of charge carriers,
ϕ, can be obtained from the slope of a plot of S0versusNa similar to previous studies.15,16

Note that studies
of CM on NCs in suspensions have, in some cases,
been affected by photocharging effects that could be avoided by stirring.40 Such effects do not play any role in our measurements
as we determine the CM efficiency from the THz conductivity due to
free mobile charges directly after the pump laser pulse. Hence, normalization
to an optical signal at longer times that may be too small due to
presence of trapped charges (and thus leads to overestimation of the
quantum yield) does not play a role. Our samples were found to be
stable during the THz conductivity measurements, and photodegrading
did not occur.
