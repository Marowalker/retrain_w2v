Understanding
how molecules in self-assembled soft-matter nanostructures
are organized is essential for improving the design of next-generation
nanomaterials. Imaging these assemblies can be challenging and usually
requires processing, e.g., staining
or embedding, which can damage or obscure features. An alternative
is to use bioinspired mineralization, mimicking how certain organisms
use biomolecules to template mineral formation. Previously, we have
reported the design and characterization of Self-Assembled peptide
caGEs (SAGEs) formed from de novo peptide building
blocks. In SAGEs, two complementary, 3-fold symmetric, peptide hubs
combine to form a hexagonal lattice, which curves and closes to form
SAGE nanoparticles. As hexagons alone cannot tile onto spheres, the
network must also incorporate nonhexagonal shapes. While the hexagonal
ultrastructure of the SAGEs has been imaged, these defects have not
been observed. Here, we show that positively charged SAGEs biotemplate
a thin, protective silica coating. Electron microscopy shows that
these SiO2-SAGEs do not collapse, but maintain their 3D
shape when dried. Atomic force microscopy reveals a network of hexagonal
and irregular features on the SiO2-SAGE surface. The dimensions
of these (7.2 nm ± 1.4 nm across, internal angles 119.8°
± 26.1°) are in accord with the designed SAGE network and
with coarse-grained modeling of the SAGE assembly. The SiO2-SAGEs are permeable to small molecules (<2 nm), but not to larger
biomolecules (>6 nm). Thus, bioinspired silicification offers a
mild
technique that preserves soft-matter nanoparticles for imaging, revealing
structural details <10 nm in size, while also maintaining desirable
properties, such as permeability to small molecules.

==== Body
In nature, organisms construct
soft-matter nanostructures to define and stabilize the form and function
of the cell. Natural self-assembled functional soft-matter architectures
include coat proteins that protect viral genetic cargo and facilitate
cell penetration for replication; protein and lipid structures that
are used to compartmentalize, manufacture, and transport materials
in bacterial and mammalian cells; and combinations of carbohydrate-based
materials and lipid–protein membranes that define bacterial
and plant cell walls. Biomolecular engineers take inspiration from
these natural systems to design nanostructured materials that assemble
from the bottom up. The self-assembling building blocks used can be
based on natural, engineered, or completely de novo biomolecules, including peptides,1,2 proteins,3,4 lipids,5 polymers,6 and DNA.7 In turn, these materials
have been adapted for use in a wide range of medical and biotechnological
applications.3,5,7

Imaging the organization of bioinspired self-assembled materials
at the molecular or nanoscale is essential for both confirming the
targeted designs and advancing the understanding of how to assemble
and apply these materials in the future. However, imaging nanoscale
biomolecular structures is challenging, as they are small, flexible,
typically not very electron dense, and assembled via weak noncovalent interactions. Staining, embedding, coating, or
cross-linking can all help to tackle these challenges and aid the
visualization of soft structures.8 Nonetheless,
such processing can also introduce unwelcome artifacts or disrupt
these delicate architectures.8 Thus, simple,
nondestructive processing methods that provide contrast are still
required. Here we take inspiration from nature and demonstrate the
use of bioinspired mineralization to preserve the 3D structure of
soft, peptide-based, self-assembled nanoparticles.

In biomineralization
biomolecules direct the precipitation of minerals
to produce hierarchical composite tissues.9,10 Over
60 biominerals occur in natural biological systems,11 including calcium carbonate,12 calcium phosphate,13,14 magnetite,15 and silica.16−19 For example, diatoms are unicellular eukaryotic algae that construct
intricate silicified cell walls, called frustules, using biomolecules
such as long-chain polyamines20 and proteins
such as arginine- and lysine-rich silaffins,21,22 cingulins,23 and phosphorylated silicidins.24 These biomolecules are thought to direct silica
to precipitate from soluble silicic acid in vivo.21,22 Silicification has been studied in vitro using
positively charged bioinspired molecules, such as lysine-rich polypeptides22,25 and other polyamines.26 The size of the
biotemplated silica structures usually correlates with their presilicified
size in solution.27 As such, silica coating
has been used to preserve soft-matter nanostructures faithfully.27−31 In pioneering work from the Brinker lab, this has been extended
to coat cells32,33 and even whole organisms.34 This has allowed features to be clearly imaged
in 3D down to ∼10 nm.31 Permeable
biomineral coatings have also been used to protect soft-matter structures
for use in medicine35,36 and catalysis.37,38 In these ways, bioinspired silicification is able to provide contrast
for nanoscale imaging and stabilize the function of soft-matter structures.

Protein cages are specifically addressable soft-matter nanostructures
with potential biomedical applications in drug targeting and delivery,39−42 vaccination,4,43 and biotechnology as nanoreactors.44−46 An example is the Self-Assembled peptide caGEs (SAGEs, Figure 1).1 SAGEs are rationally designed1 from fully characterized de novo peptide components.47 Specifically, a parallel α-helical coiled-coil
peptide homotrimer, CC-Tri3, is linked via a disulfide
bond and back-to-back to one of two obligate heterodimers, CC-Di-A
or CC-Di-B,1 making two complementary hubs (hub A and hub B) each with
3-fold symmetry. When these hubs are mixed, the heterodimers are formed,
and these drive the self-assembly of what is intended to be a hexagonal
network. Surprisingly, when imaged by electron microscopy (EM) and
using in-liquid atomic force microscopy (AFM), closed, spherical particles
are observed. This is rationalized by in silico molecular-dynamics
simulations of small patches of the SAGE network, which consistently
indicate that these multipeptide structures curve in one direction.1 However, hexagons alone cannot tile on a sphere
and are unable to form closed, convex, regular Platonic solids.48 For example, C60 (buckminsterfullerene)49 combines 20 hexagons with 12 pentagons to form
a closed Archimedean solid structure.48 Thus, the SAGE network must incorporate irregularities to form spherical
nanoparticles. It is not known if these consist of holes in the lattice
or if nonhexagonal or irregular polygons close the structures. To
date, such features on the SAGE surface have not been observed. Therefore,
we sought a method that could reveal how the peptides are organized
in SAGE particles.

Figure 1 Schematic for Self-Assembled peptide caGE (SAGE)1 design and silicification. A homotrimerizing
coiled-coil
peptide (CC-Tri3, green) is joined back-to-back via a disulfide bond to one of two heterodimeric sequences, namely,
a negatively charged CC-Di-A peptide (red) or a positively charged
CC-Di-B peptide (blue). These give hub A (CC-Tri3-CC-Di-A) and hub
B (CC-Tri3-CC-Di-B), respectively. When mixed, the hubs are posited
to form a regular hexagonal array that closes to form SAGEs. To ensure
that silica precipitation is localized onto the SAGEs when immersed
in silicic acid, the N termini or C termini of the homotrimers are
decorated with positively charged peptides.

Here we describe the application of bioinspired silicification
to form a stabilizing permeable coating on the SAGEs. We show that
this allows detailed imaging of their surfaces. AFM of the silica-coated
SAGEs (SiO2-SAGEs) reveals a hexagonal network as designed.
Moreover, with ∼7 nm vertex-to-vertex lengths, the size of
these polygons is fully consistent with the designed underlying peptide
network. The network predominantly comprises regular hexagons, but
other shapes, which are required to form a closed object from a hexagonal
lattice, are also apparent. This concurs with coarse-grained computational
modeling that we have recently performed.50 As the silicified SAGEs can be imaged clearly using standard EM
and AFM techniques, bioinspired silicification offers a facile technique
for preserving soft-matter nanostructures in 3D so that their self-organization
can be studied. In addition, silicification offers a route to stabilizing
soft, self-assembled materials for use in bionanotechnology and synthetic
biology.35,36,51

Results and Discussion
The N
and C Termini of the SAGE Homotrimer Can Be Decorated
with Positive Charge
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of a hexagonal peptide network designed for the “parent”
SAGE indicate that the arrays curve.1 In
the MD, the long axes of the trimeric coiled-coil units remain perpendicular
to the plane of the array, whereas the dimeric components rotate freely
about the two disulfide bonds. Moreover, the direction of curvature
is consistent across the simulations, with the N termini of the homotrimers
present on the convex (i.e., external)
face of the SAGEs, while the C termini are on the concave interior.
This is our working model for SAGE structure, and it provides a basis
for further design.

For this study, tetra-arginine (R4) or tetra-lysine
(K4) peptides were appended to either the N or C terminus of the homotrimer
(CC-Tri3, Figure 1, Table 1, and Tables S1–S3). The aim being that, when
assembled into SAGEs, these constructs would present positively charged
residues on the external or internal surfaces of SAGEs for N-terminal
or C-terminal appendages, respectively. In turn, these should act
as templates to localize and precipitate silica from aqueous silicic
acid onto the peptide cages. In this way, we aimed to create SiO2-SAGE particles. As controls, negatively charged tetra-glutamate
(E4) variants were also generated, which should be poor at biotemplating
silica.25

their overall charge as calculated using pepcalc.52 See Supporting Information for
further details of the naming system (Table S1), mixing peptide hubs to form SAGEs (Table S2), and the full amino-acid sequences for all peptides used in this
study (Table S3).

Peptides were synthesized, purified, and assembled
into SAGE peptide
hubs (Figure S1, Table 1, and Tables S1–S4 for sequences, naming, and characterization). For the C-terminally
decorated trimers, CC-Tri3-K4 and CC-Tri3-R4, circular dichroism (CD)
spectra gave α helicities similar to the undecorated parent
homotrimer (CC-Tri3) and as predicted based on the peptide sequences
(Figures S2 and S3 and Table S5). Moreover,
these three constructs had very similar thermal unfolding transitions,
with midpoints (TM’s) of 54, 57,
and 56 °C, respectively (Figure S2 and Table
S5). By contrast, appending positive charge to the N termini
reduced the α helicities and also the TM values to 33 and 34 °C for the K4 and R4 variants, respectively
(Figures S2 and S3 and Table S5). CC-Tri3
variants with negatively charged E4 blocks at the N and C termini
showed the opposite behavior: the former was as folded and stable
as the parent (TM = 65.5 °C), whereas
the latter was as destabilized (TM = 31
°C) as the N-terminal K4 and R4 variants, Figures S2 and S3 and Table S5. These changes in stability
of CC-Tri3 when charge is appended mirror a recent study of free-standing
α-helical peptides.53 They can be
explained in terms of repulsive interactions between the blocks and
the partial charges associated with the helical backbone, which are
positive and negative for the N and C termini, respectively.53 Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) sedimentation
velocity (SV) and sedimentation equilibrium (SE) experiments conducted
at room temperature with the parent and decorated homotrimers returned
molecular weights consistent with trimeric coiled-coil assemblies
for each construct in solution, Figure S4 and Table S6.

Together, these data
for the modified CC-Tri3 peptides show that
they are stably folded and trimeric at room temperature, albeit with
some of the thermal stabilities compromised. Therefore, we continued
with these variants, using them to construct decorated hubs for the
assembly of modified SAGE particles.

Positive Charge Localizes
Silica Biomineralization onto SAGEs
Herein, we refer to the
unmodified parent assemblies as SAGE, Figure 2a, and the SAGE variants
as follows: E4-SAGE, K4-SAGE, and R4-SAGE for the N-terminally decorated
particles, Figure 2e, and SAGE-E4, SAGE-K4, and SAGE-R4 for the C-terminally decorated
structures, Figure 2i. Acidification of sodium silicate forms a mixture of metastable
ortho- and oligosilicic acids.54 For simplicity,
we refer to this as “silicic acid”. Polymerization of
these mixtures was monitored by fluorescence of 2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl)methoxy)phenyl)oxazole
(PDMPO) without and with the various SAGE particles (Figure S5). The PDMPO indicated that the different SAGEs did
not appear to alter the amount or rate of bulk silica precipitation.
The silicification of SAGEs to form discrete biomineralized particles
was optimized to form electron dense particles (Figures 2 and S6).

Samples were prepared at a concentration of 2 μM peptide, 24
mM silicic acid, phosphate (PI) buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate
(8.02 mM dibasic K2HPO4, 1.98 mM monobasic KH2PO4), pH 7.4), 24 h, 20 °C. Scale bars are
200 nm.

As controls, silicification of
the peptide hubs alone, i.e., negatively
charged hub A or positively
charged hub B, formed mesh networks with poor contrast, Figure S7, and similar precipitates were observed
with short positively charged peptides, GYGKKKK and GYGRRRR, Figure S8. By comparison, with both hub A and
hub B present, i.e., with SAGEs
formed, silica particles were observed, and these were particularly
clear with excellent contrast for the K4- and R4-decorated SAGEs, Figures 2, S6, and S7.

In more detail, the C-terminal tetra-arginine
decoration, SAGE-R4,
gave large, slightly interconnected, and polydispersed spheres (305
± 120 nm). The tetra-lysine variants, K4-SAGE and SAGE-K4, assembled
into an interconnected mesh and smaller, slightly interconnected spheres
(Figures 2g and k and S6e and h). The most monodisperse and unconnected
nanospheres were formed by N-terminal tetra-arginine-decorated R4-SAGEs, Figures 2h and S6f. These were 213 ± 84 nm in diameter, Table S7, Figure 2h, and Figures S6h and S9. This is a significant increase in size and decrease of the distribution
compared with unmineralized R4-SAGEs (109 ± 84 nm), which were
difficult to measure, as they gave poor contrast (Figure S10). Similarly, the silicified R4-SAGEs gave better
quality scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, revealing clearer
particles when compared to unmineralized R4-SAGEs (Figure S11). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra confirmed
the presence of silicon (Si Kα = 1.74 keV) and oxygen (O Kα
= 0.53 keV) in the SiO2-R4-SAGEs (Figure
S12). The absence of any coherent electron diffraction patterns,
however, indicated that the silica coatings are likely amorphous rather
than a crystalline polymorph of silica.

In summary to this section,
a combination of TEM, SEM, and EDX
demonstrates that SAGEs can be modified with cationic tetra-peptides
to generate discrete, spherical, silicified nanoparticles, which we
refer to as SiO2-SAGEs. The best of these preparations
were made from R4-SAGEs, which we used next to optimize conditions
for preparing SiO2-SAGEs.

Formation of Discrete SiO2-SAGEs Can Be Optimized
R4-SAGEs were mineralized
with a range of silicic acid concentrations
(0–36 mM), imaged (Figure S13),
and grain-sized (Table S7). Without silicic
acid or at low concentrations (6 mM), it was difficult to discern
structures by TEM, and the grains were polydisperse. At 36 mM silicic
acid, large interconnected SiO2-R4-SAGE particles were
clear (217 ± 58 nm). We propose that high silicic acid concentrations
deposit a thicker layer of SiO2, leading to particle aggregation.
Optimal mineralization occurred at 12–24 mM silicic acid, leading
to discrete SiO2-R4-SAGE spheres with sizes distributed
around ∼200 nm in diameter (Figure 2h).

Next, we varied the peptide concentration
between 2 and 25 μM peptide for K4 and R4 SAGE variants and
mineralized these with 24 mM silicic acid at 20 °C (Figure S14). At low peptide concentrations (2–5
μM), the K4- and R4-SAGE constructs formed discrete mineralized
spheres similar to those noted above. At the higher peptide concentrations
(10–25 μM), much larger micrometer-sized mesh and network
structures were observed, which is consistent with our observations
that unmineralized SAGEs aggregate at high μM concentrations.

The SAGE system is modular, which means that the hub modules can
be mixed and matched to tune the SAGE properties. Thus far, both hub
A and hub B carried the E4, K4, or R4 decorations; that is, they were
100% decorated. To vary this, first we prepared SAGEs with undecorated
parent hub A plus hub B fully decorated with K4 or R4 (Figure S15). These were silicified using standard
conditions of 2 μM peptide, 24 mM silicic acid, and 10 mM phosphate
(PI) buffer pH 7.4, 20 °C, 24 h. Compared with 100% decoration,
these 50% decorated SAGEs form smaller particles, particularly for
the R4 variants. R4-SAGEs displaying between 50% and 100% tetra-arginine
were prepared by combining R4-hub B and mixtures of hub A with and
without the R4 decoration (Figure S16).
The less highly charged SAGEs, i.e., 50–80% R4-SAGE, formed smaller interconnected mineralized
silica particles, with average diameters of 60–90 nm, Table S8, whereas the 90% and 100% R4-SAGEs formed
the larger but nonetheless discrete structures noted above.

The 100% R4-SAGEs were also assembled and silicified at a range
of temperatures (4–37 °C). This range should not significantly
perturb the silicification process,55 but,
as the midpoint unfolding temperature (TM) of CC-R4-Tri3 is 34 °C, this range could affect homotrimer
folding and thus SAGE assembly (Figure S17). At 4 °C, the mineralized particles were small (77 ±
26 nm) interconnected spheres. At 20 °C, the particles were larger
(213 ± 84 nm) and discrete and were larger still (330 ±
168 nm) and clumped together at 25 °C. At 37 °C, smaller
(105 ± 42 nm) interconnected spheres were formed. Thus, the optimal
temperature for assembling discrete mineralized R4-SAGEs is at ∼20
°C, where the CC-R4-Tri3 should be well folded, but there is
enough thermal energy to avoid forming the small, interconnected structures
assembled seen at lower temperatures.

Finally, the components
for 100% R4-SAGEs were mixed at between
pH 5.5 and 8.0, and the products silicified at the assembly pH. At
low pH, silica formation is known to be slowed, but the 24 h mineralization
used should be ample for silica formation.55 TEM images (Figure S18) reveal that silicification
at neutral pH (7.0 and 7.4) led to discrete spherical particles, whereas
at higher pH values (7.5–8.0), interconnected SAGEs resembling
those formed at higher (36 mM) silicic acid concentrations were formed,
which we attribute to rapid and more complete precipitation of silica.
At slightly lower pH values (6.5 and 6.0) spheres were discernible,
but these were embedded in meshes. Finally, at pH 5.5 only thin sheets
were visible, which we ascribed to the precipitation of silica by
largely unfolded aggregated peptide.

Thus, we find that for
R4-SAGE particles, which provide the best
substrates for silicification, there are optimal conditions for mineralization
to produce SiO2-R4-SAGEs. These are summarized in Figure 3 and comprise 2–5
μM peptide, 90–100% R4-decorated hubs, 20 °C, and
pH 7.0–7.4 PI buffer, mineralized with 12–24 mM silicic
acid for 24 h.

is highlighted in yellow. Arrows represent increasing values of the
condition illustrated.

3D Structure of SiO2-SAGEs Can Be Visualized by EM
Tomography and AFM
We recorded TEM tilt series for SiO2-R4-SAGEs and used these to construct tomograms and 3D models
of the mineralized particles (Movies S1–S4,
Figure S19). The tomograms showed that the particles did not
collapse significantly when dried onto TEM grids; that is, dried SiO2-R4-SAGEs retained their 3D structure. SiO2-R4-SAGEs
were also imaged by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM)
and PeakForce AFM (PF-AFM), Figure S20.
AFM measurements of unmineralized SAGEs revealed significant
collapse of the peptide particles upon drying to give an aspect ratio
(AR) between the height z and the diameter in
the x–y plane of
∼0.1.1 By contrast, the dried SiO2-R4-SAGEs had an aspect ratio of ∼0.7 in AFM. Thus,
the silica coating reinforces SiO2-R4-SAGEs against collapse.

We were interested to see if silicification also preserved the
structure of the peptide building blocks and pores between the hub
subunits anticipated from the original design, Figure S21. PF-AFM was used to map variations in the height,
adhesion, and dissipation properties of the surface of a cluster of
SiO2-R4-SAGEs (Figure 4). Despite variations in the topography due to the
near-spherical shape of the SiO2-R4-SAGEs, the surfaces
of the nanoparticles could be imaged. This revealed a polygonal lattice
texture on the surface of all the SiO2-R4-SAGEs imaged
(Figure S22).

in (a) the height, (b) adhesion, and (c) dissipation properties of
the SiO2-R4-SAGEs (upper parts of images) and mica (lower
parts of images). (d) 3D plot of the topography. The mica surface
is smooth, whereas the SiO2-R4-SAGE surface reveals texture,
which is shown in greater detail in Figure 5. Silicification was performed with 2 μM
peptide, 12 mM silicic acid, and PI buffer, 24 h, 20 °C.

Interrogation of these patterns
on individual SiO2-R4-SAGEs
with PF-AFM identified polygons with vertex-to-vertex spacings of
7.2 ± 1.4 nm (Figure 5). This is entirely consistent with the SAGE
design.1 Moreover, these features were
apparent in the height, adhesion, and dissipation plots, with regions
of increased height and adhesion colocalized, Figure 5e, h, and i. The network was also seen in
phase contrast in TM-AFM (Figure S23f and i). Ridges, created by the peptide framework within the biotemplated
silica, should present as raised lattice structures on the curved
SAGE surface with increased height, nanoscale roughness, and flexibility
when compared to a silica-filled pore (Figure
S21). This was indeed observed in PF-AFM, with raised ridges
corresponding to higher adhesion (roughness) and dissipation (flexibility)
when compared to the pore centers, and confirmed by positive phase
shifts on ridges in TM-AFM.

panels f–i with shapes drawn to guide the eye. Silicification
was performed with 2 μM peptide, 12 mM silicic acid, and PI
buffer, 24 h, 20 °C.

Interestingly, the AFM data also revealed variations in the
originally
intended hexagonal network (Figure 5j and l). To help quantify the extent of these variations,
a model for a smooth nonsymmetric convex surface was fitted to the
height data to flatten the dome shape of the particle (Figure S24b). This generated a topology map of
the particle, highlighting variance due to surface features (i.e., pores and ridges). The internal angles
of the polygonal structures from unflattened images were distributed
around 120° (119.4° ± 26.9°, Figure S24d). Nonetheless, other angles, e.g., for pentagons (108.0°), heptagons (128.6°),
and irregular polygons, also fell comfortably within the distribution.

The internal angles measured from coarse-grained modeling of SAGE
assembly (see Mosayebi etal.50 and Figure S24c and d) showed a major peak centered on hexagonal polygons (122.0°
± 25.0°), which agrees well with the experimental data.
However, there was also a small peak for squares at 89.6° ±
8.6°, which is not observed experimentally. The squares are likely
to be due to the simulated network, which comprises obligate heteromeric
pairings of pure hubs (i.e., hub
A and hub B only), not being able to access odd-sided polygons, e.g., pentagons, to close the SAGEs. In
the experimental system, however, nonhexagonal polygons could form
by noncognate peptide interactions (i.e., CC-Di-B to CC-Di-B or CC-Di-A to CC-Di-A), especially as hubs
of the same type are brought into close proximity during assembly,
significantly increasing the local concentration of heterodimer. Alternatively,
as the peptide hubs are inherently dynamic, the homotrimers may exchange
to form mixed hubs, which would also increase the chances of incorporating
nonhexagonal structures. The current simulations do not allow for
subunit exchange in hubs and penalize homomerization of the heterodimer
components, both of which would facilitate the formation of the odd-sided
polygons by SAGE hubs during assembly. This will be explored in future
coarse-grained models.

These observations indicate how the peptide
lattice adapts to close
and leads us to refine our initial hypothesis for SAGE assembly and
structure, which centered on the formation and propagation of hexagonal
peptide arrays, Figure 1.1 The inclusion of nonhexagonal and irregular
shapes, as revealed herein using the SiO2-SAGE system and
supported by coarse-grained computational modeling of SAGE assembly
(vide infra),50 presents
a clear mechanism for closure. The variations that we see are not
evenly spaced on the surface (Figures 5f–m, S24) as required
in Archimedean solids,48 so the SAGE peptides
self-assemble to form more complex, irregular polyhedra.

SiO2-SAGEs Are Permeable to Small Molecules and Peptides,
but Not to Proteins
Permeable biomineral coatings have been
used to protect enzymes,37,38 drug cargos,56 and vaccines.35,36,51 With a view to using SiO2-SAGEs in these
contexts, we tested their permeability to small molecules and proteins.
To do this, we set up a reporter system, which uses the modularity
of the SAGE system to introduce a fluorophore into the peptide fabric
of the SAGEs, Figure 6a. An R4-SAGE preparation was doped with 2.5% of hub B harboring
carboxyfluorescein (hub B-fl). When silicified, these R4-SAGE-fls
formed particles indistinguishable from R4-SAGEs by TEM, Figure 6b. Moreover, the
particles were fluorescent, and correlative light and electron microscopy
(CLEM)57,58 showed that this fluorescence colocalized
with the particles observed by TEM, Figures 6c and d and S25. Consistent with this, prior to silicification R4-SAGE-fls were
difficult to visualize by TEM, but fluorescent particles were clear
by light microscopy (LM), Figure S26. We
found that higher concentrations of silicic acid (36 mM) reduced detection
of the fluorescence signal, and, therefore, we used intermediate silicic
acid concentrations (12–24 mM) to form thinner silica coatings.

given in Figure S26. R4-SAGE-fls without
additives (e, i, m) and after treatment with (f, j, n) Trypan blue;
(g, k, n) tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP);
and (h, l, p) trypsin.

To monitor small-molecule ingress into SiO2-R4-SAGE-fls,
we used the fluorescence quencher Trypan blue, which must contact
the fluorophore to quench it.59,60 Trypan blue is small
(∼1.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 nm) and was able to quench the
fluorescence of both R4-SAGE-fls and SiO2-R4-SAGE-fls, Figure 6f, j, and n. The
SAGE structures were still visible in bright-field LM images (Figure S26), indicating that Trypan blue can
traverse the silica coating to effect quenching.

For delivery
applications, small-molecule cargos must be able to
exit the host vehicle. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride
(TCEP) reduces the disulfide bonds used to construct the SAGE hubs
and so disassembles SAGE particles.1 TCEP
treatment reduced the number and intensity of fluorescent SiO2-R4-SAGE-fls particles, Figure 6g, k, and o, consistent with disruption of SAGEs and
the release of peptides from the biomineralized structures (CC-Tri3
is ∼3.0 × 1.5 × 1.5 nm when folded). Nonetheless,
particles were still visible by bright-field LM and TEM after this
treatment, Figures S26 and S27, demonstrating
that the biomineral replicas remain intact after TCEP treatment to
remove the peptides.

Finally, to test if larger proteins penetrated
the silica barrier,
R4-SAGE-fls and SiO2-R4-SAGE-fls were treated with the
protease trypsin. For the former, nonmineralized particles’
fluorescent puncta were lost, Figure 6h, indicating proteolysis of the SAGE peptides and
release of the fluorophores. However, with the SiO2-R4-SAGE-fls
these objects remained visible, indicating that the silica coat protected
the peptides from proteolysis by trypsin, Figure 6l and p. The trypsin may be too large (∼7.0
× 6.0 × 5.5 nm) to penetrate the silicified SAGEs or may
adhere to the silica coat becasue it has a pI of ∼10. However,
as the pI of CC-Tri3 (∼9) and trypsin are similar and the smaller
CC-Tri3-fl does appear to traverse the silica coating, it is unlikely
that charge alone is responsible for preventing proteolysis of the
SiO2-SAGEs by trypsin. Together, these data indicate that
SiO2-SAGEs are permeable to small molecules (<2 nm across),
including fluorescence quenchers, reducing agents, and the peptide
building blocks of the SAGEs themselves, but not to larger (∼6
nm across) protein molecules such as trypsin.

Conclusions and Future
Directions
Herein we demonstrate
that SAGE particles can be decorated with positive charge, assembled,
and controllably silicified under mild conditions in aqueous buffer.
We find that an N-terminal tetra-arginine tag, to give R4-SAGEs, forms
discrete silica-coated particles. We have tuned the particle size
between ∼50 and 200 nm by controlling the proportion of tetra-arginine
in the SAGE particles, by altering silicic acid concentration, and
also by optimizing the conditions for SAGE assembly (peptide concentration,
temperature, and pH). We envisage this ability to control particle
size and functionalization could allow silicified SAGE particles to
be tailored for use in a range of biotechnological applications. We
find that SiO2-SAGEs particles do not form below pH 6.0
and that they aggregate above pH 7.5. This suggests that SAGE particles
assembled at or near neutral pH could then be disassembled under acidic
conditions. Such pH-triggered disassembly could be used to release
encapsulated cargos controllably within target cells, as acidification
during endosomal trafficking should lead to disassembly and thus delivery.61

SiO2-SAGEs maintain their 3D
structure when dried, which facilitates imaging of the underlying
polygonal peptide network. The network shows predominantly hexagonal
shapes ∼7 nm across, consistent with our original design and in silico models.1,50 However, and interestingly,
it also reveals the presence of nonhexagonal and irregular polygons
with internal angles distributed evenly about the hexagonal 120°.
These are necessary to close the network, as hexagons alone cannot
tile on a sphere. These experimental measurements largely concur with
a coarse-grained computational model for SAGE assembly that we are
developing,50 which shows the dominance
of a hexagonal arrangement of hubs and highlights the importance of
nonhexagonal polygons to achieve closure. However, the simulations
suggest that square arrangements of hubs should be more abundant than
we observe experimentally. This current model disfavors mechanisms
that can access odd-sided polygons in the lattice, e.g., homotypic association of the two heterodimer
components or exchange within the homotrimer core to form mixed hubs.
The AFM data show that the peptide network within SiO2-R4-SAGEs
is able to form internal angles consistent with odd-sided polygons
rather than closing using squares. In turn, this indicates that defect
formation via one of the above two or other mechanisms
must be in operation during SAGE assembly. These concepts and the
experimental data from the SiO2-SAGEs are being incorporated
into a revised coarse-grained model to explore the formation of odd-
and even-sided hub assemblies.

As the SAGEs are closed by small
shape defects rather than by large
holes in the lattice, any larger cargos contained within SAGEs should
not leak out. This bodes well for using them to support active proteins
and enzymes;45,46 for drug encapsulation, targeting,
and delivery;42,62 and as antigen presentation vaccine
platforms.3,4 Biomineral coatings are currently used to
protect drug cargos,56,63 vaccines,36,51 and enzymes37,64 by stabilizing biomolecules against
thermal and other degradation. Thus, bioinspired silicification of
SAGEs functionalized for use in medical or biotechnological applications
could afford similar protection to these particles. SAGEs could also
be designed to template other materials.65,66 For example, SAGEs displaying antigens could be coated with adjuvantive51 and/or protective36 calcium phosphate to create stabilized vaccine formulations with
improved efficacies and shelf-lives. SAGEs displaying ligands for
cell-surface receptors and disease treatment could also be decorated
with gold nanoparticles to combine targeting, imaging, and treatment
of diseased cells,67 or SAGEs coated with
platinum nanoparticles could evolve hydrogen more effectively than
disordered Pt nanoparticles.68 The SAGE
system has clear attributes to facilitate such applications, including
its modularity, our ability to redesign it, and the ease with which
the SAGE components can be functionalized. Therefore, by mixing and
matching appropriately modified hub components, there is considerable
potential to develop a range of tailored multifunctional organic,
inorganic, and/or biologically decorated SAGEs for future applications.

Materials and Methods

materials and methods, see the Supporting Information.

Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc solid-phase synthesis69 on Rink amide resin in a Liberty microwave peptide
synthesizer on 0.1 mM scales (see Tables S1–S3). Each amino acid was coupled (5 equiv of Fmoc amino acid, 4.5 equiv
of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and 10 equiv of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) in 7 mL
of dimethylforamide (DMF) with 25 W microwave irradiation at 50 °C
for 5 min), washed (5 × 7 mL of DMF), deprotected (20% (v/v)
morpholine in DMF, with 20 W microwave irradiation at 75 °C for
5 min), and then washed before the next amino acid was added. Assembled
peptides were acetylated on resin (3 equiv of acetic anhydride and
4.5 equiv of N,N-diisopropylethlamine
(DIPEA) in 7 mL of DMF for 30 min). Peptides were cleaved from the
resin with 94% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2% (v/v) 1,2-ethanedithiol
(EDT), 2% (v/v) water, and 2% (v/v) triisopropylsilane (TIPS) for
3 h. Peptides were filtered, precipitated using diethyl ether (Et2O), pelleted (4000g, 10 min, 4 °C),
and freeze-dried.

Peptides were purified using reverse-phase
high-pressure liquid
chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a Kromatek (semimicro, 5 μm, 100
Å, 10 mm i.d. × 150 mm L) C18 column, using a linear gradient
of buffer A (0.1% (v/v) TFA in water) and 20–80% buffer B (0.1%
(v/v) TFA in MeCN). Purified peptide peaks were analyzed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF) and analytical RP-HPLC. For 2,2′-dipyridyldisulfide
(DPDS) thiol activation70 of heterodimer
A or B, ∼5 mg of heterodimer was dissolved in 5 mL of water
or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Ten equivalents of DPDS in 1 mL of methanol
(MeOH) was added. After 1 h, excess DPDS was removed using 3 ×
30 mL of Et2O, and the activated peptide was freeze-dried,
purified using RP-HPLC, characterized (MALDI-TOF and analytical RP-HPLC),
and freeze-dried. To form hubs, each homotrimer was mixed with an
activated heterodimer in equimolar amounts in PBS (∼1 mg mL–1 peptide) and mixed for 3 h at 20 °C. Hubs were
purified by RP-HPLC and characterized (MALDI-TOF and analytical RP-HPLC, Figure S1 and Table S4).

Circular dichroism
(CD) spectra were recorded at between 5 and
90 °C using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter fitted with a Peltier
temperature controller. A 1 mm path length quartz cuvette containing
50 μM peptide in phosphate buffer (PI, 10 mM potassium phosphate
(8.02 mM dibasic K2HPO4, 1.98 mM monobasic KH2PO4) pH 7.4), 25 mM NaCl and 250 μM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride (TCEP) was heated at 40 °C h–1. The mean residue ellipticity (MRE) at 222 nm was recorded every
1 °C, and full CD spectra (190–260 nm) were recorded every
5 °C. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed on each homotrimer
(325 μM peptide in PI, 1.625 mM TCEP, and 25 mM NaCl). Sedimentation
velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted
using Beckman Optima XL-A and XL-I analytical ultracentrifuges with
An-60 and An-50 rotors, respectively, and at 20 °C. For SV, samples
were spun at 60 krpm with 120 scans collected between 5.8 and 7.3
cm, and data fitted using SEDFIT.71 For
SE, data were collected at six rotor speeds between 30 and 48 krpm
and fitted with a single ideal species model using Ultrascan II.72 The partial specific volumes (v̅) for each peptide, buffer densities, and viscosities were calculated
using SEDNTERP73 (Table
S6).

Typically for silicification, SAGEs were assembled
(2 μM
hub A + 2 μM hub B) in PI buffer for 1 h at 20 °C; then
500 μL of these samples were mixed with 500 μL of PI buffer
containing 0–36 mM freshly prepared silicic acid74 and washed 3× with water after 24 h. A
0.5 μL volume of 2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl)methoxy)phenyl)oxazole
(PDMPO, LysoTracker)75 was added to 100
μL of mineralization solution to monitor the polymerization
of silica in solution by fluorescence emission.

For SEM, samples
were dried on silicon wafers fixed to an aluminum
stub. Unmineralized samples were coated with ∼5 nm Au–Pd
using an Emtech 575X sputter coater. Stubs were imaged in a FEI Quanta
FEG-SEM. Samples were dried on carbon-coated copper grids and imaged
on a Tecnai 12–FEI 120 kV BioTwin Spirit transmission electron
microscope. Tilt series between angles of ∼70° and ∼−70°
for tomographic reconstructions were collected using a Tecnai 20–FEI
200 kV Twin Lens scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).
Images were collected using a FEI Eagle 4k × 4k CCD camera. Grain
sizes of SiO2-SAGEs were measured from representative TEM
images using ImageJ76,77 and distributions fitted in Origin
2015 64 bit (eq S3). Tilt series were aligned
and reconstructed using eTomo in the IMOD78,79 software package (University of Colorado, Boulder). 3D reconstructions
of tomograms were rendered in Amira 3D (FEI software). Movie files
of the tomographic reconstruction software outputs were compiled in
ImageJ76 and compressed using HandBrake.
EDX spectra were recorded using a JEOL 2100F STEM and a Gatan Orius
11 megapixel 832 camera. X-rays were detected using an 80 mm2 AZtec detector and processed using AZtecTEM software. For CLEM,57,58 fluorescent R4-SAGE-fls were imaged first using a Leica DMI4000
B inverted epifluorescence microscope, then using a TEM (see above).
Fluorescence was overlain with TEM images using the TurboReg plug-in
in Fiji.80

TM-AFM was performed on
a Multimode microscope with a Quadrexed
Nanoscope III controller using Scout-Beta cantilevers (NuNano, Bristol,
UK). PF-AFM was conducted on a Multimode VIII microscope with Nanoscope
V controller and a fast scan head unit in combination with SCANASYST-AIR-HR
cantilevers (Bruker, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using Nanoscope
Analysis 1.5 software (Bruker, CA, USA), and scripts written in Matlab
(Mathworks). Design and parametrization of the coarse-grained computational
modeling are described in Mosayabi etal.50

The permeability of particles
to small molecules was tested using
silica-coated and unsilicified fluorescent R4-SAGE-fls. A 1 mL mineralization
of silicified R4-SAGE-fls was washed as above, pelleted (17000g, 5 min, 20 °C) and resuspended in 100 μL of
PI buffer, and 10 μL was added to 30 μL of PI buffer.
As a control, 40 μL of unmineralized fluorescent SAGE was used.
Samples were made up to a total volume of 50 μL by PI buffer
(control, no additive) or PI buffer plus a fluorescence quenching
molecule (10 μL 0.4% (w/v) Trypan blue, 2 h at 20 °C),
a reducing agent (10 μL of TCEP, 2 h at 20 °C), or a protease
(trypsin, 5 μL 1 mg mL–1, 2 h at 37 °C).
Samples were transferred to slides and imaged on a fluorescence microscope
(detailed above).
