There
are currently no experimental techniques that combine atomic-resolution
imaging with elemental sensitivity and chemical fingerprinting on
single molecules. The advent of using molecular-modified tips in noncontact
atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) has made it possible to image (planar)
molecules with atomic resolution. However, the mechanisms responsible
for elemental contrast with passivated tips are not fully understood.
Here, we investigate elemental contrast by carrying out both nc-AFM
and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) experiments on epitaxial
monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on Ir(111). The hBN overlayer
is inert, and the in-plane bonds connecting nearest-neighbor boron
and nitrogen atoms possess strong covalent character and a bond length
of only ∼1.45 Å. Nevertheless, constant-height maps of
both the frequency shift Δf and the local contact
potential difference exhibit striking sublattice asymmetry. We match
the different atomic sites with the observed contrast by comparison
with nc-AFM image simulations based on the density functional theory
optimized hBN/Ir(111) geometry, which yields detailed information
on the origin of the atomic-scale contrast.

Atomic-resolution
microscopies
are key enabling techniques in modern materials research. These techniques
include scanning probe microscopies (scanning tunneling microscopy,
STM, and noncontact atomic force microscopy, nc-AFM)1−3 as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (e.g., scanning transmission electron microscopy,
STEM).4 Identifying different elements
is more challenging, especially based purely on experimental results.5−9 Modern, aberration-corrected electron microscopes make it possible
to chemically fingerprint different elements through atomic-resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)8−11 or Z-contrast
in the annular dark field imaging mode.12 These techniques, when coupled with ab initio calculations,
can also yield information on chemical bonding configuration down
to the single-atom level.10,11 However, electron microscopy
has demonstrated chemical sensitivity only on solid state materials.
Due to the high-energy electron beam, STEM has not yet reached atomic
structural or chemical resolution on more sensitive structures such
as small organic molecules. On the other hand, scanning probe microscopy
can be used to image small molecules with atomic resolution.13,14

When operated in the frequency modulation mode,15 nc-AFM measures atomic-scale forces between
the tip on
an oscillating cantilever and the sample surface through changes of
the resonance frequency (Δf) of the cantilever.
nc-AFM can yield atomic resolution, which has been amply demonstrated
on elemental semiconductors as well as on heteroatomic surfaces of
compound semiconductors and polar insulators such as alkali halides
and oxides.1,3,6,16−18 On such heteroatomic surfaces,
typically only one type of atom is actually imaged with a given tip,
because the polar nature of the compounds results in a strong variation
in the short-range forces above the negatively and positively charged
atoms.5,19 Additional information can be gained from
force spectroscopy, i.e., the measurement
of Δf as a function of tip–sample distance z. In a seminal contribution, Sugimoto etal. identified different atomic species in a disordered
surface alloy on Si(111) by comparing the maximum attractive forces
on different lattice sites.7 This methodology
has recently been extended to estimating electronegativities of surface
atoms.20 In addition to the force channel,
another avenue for achieving elemental contrast is to measure the
local contact potential difference (LCPD) by Kelvin probe force microscopy
(KPFM).21−27 Nevertheless, contrast between different elements on the surface
has thus far only been observed for highly polar or reactive surfaces.

Atomic-resolution nc-AFM studies can be extended to molecular systems
through chemical passivation of the tip apex, e.g., by controlled pick-up of a single carbon monoxide (CO)
molecule.13,14,28−36 With these tips, it is possible to enter a regime where the tip–sample
interaction is dominated by the Pauli repulsion between the last atom
of the tip and the sample atom directly under it.28,37−39 In addition to molecules, this technique has been
used to measure atomic positions and surface corrugations of two-dimensional
materials (e.g., graphene and hexagonal
boron nitride).32,40−44

Achieving chemical sensitivity with passivated
tips is a more delicate
issue, as bond formation with the sample similar to reactive tips
is suppressed. Still, changes in the total electron density and electrostatic
forces on different atoms are expected to contribute to the image
contrast.18,37,45−48 Consequently, passivated tips enabled elemental contrast also on
molecular systems, in both Δf29,49−52 and LCPD.50,53 However, cross-talk between perceived
elemental contrast and nonplanar topography, edge effects, and resulting
image distortions due to flexibility of the tip apex make systematic
studies in molecular systems challenging.34,35,51,52,54−56 At present, chemical fingerprinting
by scanning probe microscopy remains an elusive goal.

Here,
we demonstrate elemental contrast in both Δf and LCPD on a covalently bonded system, monolayer hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN). This system is well-defined on the atomic level
and does not suffer from topographic corrugation or edge effects.
We employ nc-AFM with CO-functionalized tips28 to investigate the atomic-scale contrast on epitaxial hBN on Ir(111).57 Despite the mostly covalent character of the
B–N bond58,59 and a nearest-neighbor distance
of only ∼1.45 Å, constant-height maps of both Δf and LCPD acquired over hBN/Ir(111) exhibit striking sublattice
asymmetry. nc-AFM image simulations based on the density functional
theory (DFT)-optimized hBN/Ir(111) geometry allow us to match the
two distinct atomic sites with the boron and the nitrogen sublattices.
Studies on such clean model systems are essential to shine light on
the origin of atomic-scale contrast in nc-AFM on surfaces and molecular
systems.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the DFT-optimized structure of our model surface, monolayer hBN on
Ir(111) (see Methods for computational details).
The lattice mismatch between hBN and the iridium surface results in
a periodic variation of the stacking between boron and nitrogen and
substrate atoms, thus creating a moiré superstructure with
a periodicity of approximately 30 Å. The different registries
dictate the interaction strength between the hBN layer and the metallic
surface, giving rise to a structural corrugation of the overlayer
of ∼1.3 Å, as well as a modulation of the local work function
within the moiré unit cell.57 However,
the regions surrounding the moiré depressions are essentially
flat.

Figure 1b is an
atomically resolved STM image of hBN grown on Ir(111) by chemical
vapor deposition (see Methods for experimental
details), acquired with a CO-passivated tip prepared on a Cu(111)
surface (CO/Cu tip) (all data shown here were acquired with CO/Cu
tips). The topography highlights the depressions of the superstructure
and alignment of the hBN lattice with the moiré unit cell,
in good agreement with the DFT calculations and previous studies.57,60 Two constant-height nc-AFM images, recorded at different tip–sample
distances Δz and with the same CO-passivated
tip, are shown in Figures 1c,d. Throughout the article, Δz refers
to the relative tip–sample approach with respect to the STM
feedback set point. Thus, negative Δz increases
the tip–sample distance and positive Δz decreases it. In both images, two different levels of contrast can
be distinguished, corresponding to the moiré and hBN lattices.
At large distances (panel c, Δz = −0.3
Å), the depressions of the moiré appear with a less negative
Δf. Similarly, the atomic contrast comprises
a hexagonal lattice of top sites with less negative Δf. Both contrasts seem to reverse at small tip–sample
distances (panel d, Δz = 0.7 Å), where
the moiré depressions exhibit more negative Δf, and at the atomic scale, a honeycomb lattice of less
negative Δf appears.

In the limit of
small amplitudes, for which the frequency shift
is given by Δf = −f0/2k. ∂zFz (Fz is the vertical component of the tip–sample
force1 and f0 and k are the resonance frequency and stiffness
of the cantilever, respectively), more negative Δf values can be interpreted as more attractive tip–sample forces.
Then, the moiré contrast reversal is easily explained: At large
tip–sample distance, the depressions are less attractive than
the surrounding regions, while at close distances they are less repulsive
[see Supporting Information (SI) for comparison
of the frequency shift as a function of tip–sample distance
between the moiré depression and the surrounding region].

Understanding the atomic-scale features requires a more careful
inspection, as a mere reversal from attractive to repulsive contrast
is not expected for CO-passivated tips.32Figure 2a–h
show a series of distance-dependent constant-height nc-AFM images,
covering a z-range of 1.6 Å. At very large distances
(panel a), no atomic contrast is observed, but only the long-range
moiré corrugation. Approaching the surface (panel b), the hexagonal
pattern of less negative Δf appears, similarly
to Figure 1c. On further
reducing the tip–sample distance (panels c–e), every
second hollow site starts to exhibit less negative Δf as well, such that a lattice with three distinct sites
forms. At very close distances (panels f–h), the intensities
of the two sites with the less negative Δf approach
each other and equalize. Because the two sites have different sizes,
this gives rise to a hexagonal lattice of repulsive triangles, which
we interpret as the atomic lattice of the hBN. Thus, the sites of
less negative Δf observed at large distances
(Figure 2b) do not
correspond to the hollow sites of the atomic hBN lattice appearing
less attractive but one of the two top sites appearing more repulsive.
We have reproduced this evolution of the atomic contrast with several
macroscopically different CO tips prepared on Cu(111), as well as
with CO tips prepared on Ir(111) [see SI for images acquired with a CO tip prepared on Ir(111)]. The observed
contrast is thus intrinsic and not related to tip artifacts.

force difference (magenta, semitransparent: raw data; solid: adjacent-averaged).
Note that data in (a)–(h) are taken with a different CO/Cu
tip than data in (i)–(k).

The above observations reveal a clear asymmetry between the
boron
and nitrogen sublattices in nc-AFM images of hBN. We can quantify
this asymmetry by measuring the frequency shift as a function of tip–sample
distance [Δf(z)], as depicted
in Figures 2i,j. The
graph in Figure 2j
shows Δf(z) spectra for the
three distinct sites, each of which is the average of three equivalent
locations as marked in Figure 2i (see SI for the individual spectra).
In Figure 2k, we plot
the difference (black) between the two inequivalent top sites (green,
red) of the hBN lattice and the corresponding force difference (magenta)
recovered from Δf via the Sader–Jarvis
method.61 Taking the adjacent-averaged
force data, the difference between the boron and nitrogen sublattice
at typical imaging distances is no more than 10 pN. Note that the
Δf(z) approach curves go to
smaller tip–sample distances than the images in Figure 2a–h, but we observed
instabilities of the tip–sample junction when imaging at such
small distances.

In order to match the two sublattices with
the boron and nitrogen
atoms, we simulate nc-AFM images using the MechAFM code,62 which is based on a molecular mechanics model
taking into account the flexibility of the CO molecule at the tip
apex34,35,41 and the atomic
coordinates from the DFT-optimized hBN/Ir(111) structure (see Methods for details of the nc-AFM simulations).
Recent studies have shown the importance of electrostatic forces in
understanding AFM image contrast,46,47 and thus they
need to be taken into account as well. However, there are contradicting
reports regarding the charge associated with CO-passivated metal tips.18,35,45,46,48 One issue is that ab initio simulations of such tips usually focus on unrealistically small
tip models, often containing none28,37,39 or only a few metal atoms30,31,38,48 in addition
to the CO molecule. We address this problem by employing DFT to simulate
more realistic tip models, which also contain a metallic surface to
account for the bulk tip56 (see Methods for computational details).

In Figure 3a, we
plot the effective long-range electrostatic field of the tip extracted
from our DFT calculations for several CO/Cu and CO/Ir tip models.
The different models are grouped into four classes: (i) purely metal,
pyramidal clusters (“cluster tips”), (ii) metal clusters
on a metal surface (“surface tips”), (iii) CO on a metal
cluster (“CO-cluster tips”), and (iv) CO on a metal
cluster on a metal surface (“CO-surface tips”). An example
tip and its actual electric field is shown for each of the four classes
in Figure 3b–e
(see SI for the structures of all calculated
tips). In order to clearly demonstrate the effect of the CO molecule
and Cu surface on the electric field, all example tips have the same
10-atom Cu cluster. The cluster tip in Figure 3b exhibits a positive electric field, as
is commonly assumed for metallic tips.18,45,48 However, Figure 3a indicates that within DFT, not just the magnitude
but also the sign of this field depend on the precise cluster geometry.
For surface tips, we find consistently a positive electric field at
the apex, as demonstrated in Figure 3d. Adding a CO to a Cu cluster tip, as shown in Figure 3c, results in a negative
electric field at the apex, in agreement with previous DFT calculations
for a CO-cluster tip.48 Indeed, we find
that most of the CO-cluster tips exhibit a negative effective electric
field. In contrast, Figure 3a reveals that within the most realistic subset of CO-surface
tips, all but one exhibit a positive effective electric field. This
positive electric field is due to the bulk metallic tip and results
from the Smoluchowski effect, and this is the dominant long-range
contribution. We observe a negative field at around 2 Å from
the oxygen apex (see Figure 3e),48 but the extent of this negative
component is exaggerated for cluster tips as seen in Figure 3c, due to the multiple exposed
apexes and their unphysical impact on the Smoluchowski effect. In
the more realistic CO-surface tip models used here, the field rapidly
becomes positive, as shown in Figure 3e. The electric field for the CO-surface tip shown
in Figure 3e agrees
qualitatively well with the semiempirical CO tip model introduced
by Ellner etal.,48 which was fitted to reproduce the nc-AFM contrast of a
Cl vacancy in NaCl. However, in their model the negative electric
field close to the oxygen extends more into the vacuum compared to
our CO-surface tips before it becomes positive. Our finding applies
to both Cu and Ir tips, suggesting that this is a general feature
of CO/metal tips. Calculation of the dipole associated with the whole
tip instead of the effective electric field yields qualitatively identical
results, and the conclusions do not depend on which method is used
(see SI for a plot of the dipole for all
simulated tip models). Hence, the simplest reasonable approximation
is to consider the CO tip as carrying a positive partial charge. This
charge then interacts with the electrostatic potential of the hBN/Ir(111)
sample obtained from DFT, thus accounting for the electrostatic forces
in our nc-AFM simulations. Despite its simplicity, such an approach
has previously shown to yield excellent agreement with experimental
nc-AFM images.14,47

Three large-scale, simulated nc-AFM
images of hBN/Ir(111) at different
tip–sample distances and for a positively charged CO tip (qtip = 0.5 e) are shown in Figure 4a. Surprisingly,
the image simulations suggest that the boron sublattice appears first
in the constant-height images, with the nitrogens becoming visible
only as the tip further approaches the hBN layer.

distances, with overlaid hBN lattice. Large circles: nitrogen, small
circles: boron. The z values indicate the height
of the unrelaxed oxygen atom with respect to the mean height of the

For comparison, we also simulated
nc-AFM images with a neutral
(qtip = 0.0e) and negatively
charged (qtip = −0.5e) tip, as shown in Figure 4b and c, respectively. The main observations are as follows:
Even when neglecting electrostatic interactions as for the neutral
tip, there is a slight asymmetry between the boron and nitrogen sublattice,
with the former appearing first at large tip–sample distances.
This atomic contrast is thus due to short-range interactions, which
are described by Lennard-Jones-type pair potentials in the nc-AFM
simulation, and is in agreement with the larger atomic radius of boron
compared with nitrogen,63 which causes
an earlier onset of repulsive forces. This asymmetry then becomes
more pronounced with a positively charged tip, which also causes strong
distortions of the atomic honeycomb lattice at small tip–sample
distances, such that it appears as a hexagonal lattice of repulsive
triangles. This contrast is found neither for the neutral nor for
the negatively charged tip. On the contrary, the negatively charged
tip yields a nearly perfect honeycomb lattice at such small distances.
At large tip–sample distances, it shows the nitrogens first
and, importantly, also causes a reversal of the moiré contrast,
which is not observed for the other two tips. Thus, by far the best
agreement with the experimental data is achieved for the positively
charged tip (see SI for image simulations
at additional heights).

The fact that the boron sublattice is
observed first is rather
counterintuitive: As repulsive atomic contrast is dominated by the
Pauli repulsion, one would expect the element exhibiting the higher
charge density to appear first upon approaching the surface. Figure 4d shows constant-height
slices of the electron density from our DFT calculations, at the heights
of the tip’s oxygen atom in the image simulations. While the
slice at largest distance has significant contributions of the underlying
Ir substrate (note also the very small scale of the changes in the
electron density), at the two smaller tip–sample distances,
the nitrogens clearly exhibit a higher electron density. Thus, our
nc-AFM images contradict the conventional interpretation, which highlights
the limitations of relying only on the Δf channel.24

Figure 5a–h
display a full series of simulated nc-AFM images for the positively
charged CO tip, covering a total range of tip–sample distances
of 1.6 Å, the same as in the experimental series (Figure 2a–h). The detailed evolution
of the moiré and atomic contrast is in excellent agreement:
The theoretical images reproduce all three observed atomic contrasts,
as well as the relative range of tip–sample distances at which
they appear. In addition, the simulation indicates that only at closest
tip–sample distances (Figure 3i) is the contrast formation strongly influenced by
the bending of the CO at the tip apex, while this effect is negligible
for images taken farther away. It is noteworthy that even though it
is well-established that bulk metallic tips carry a positive electric
field,48,64 our finding that it also influences the
atomic contrast with CO-terminated tips is surprising with respect
to previous studies.48 In fact, based on
the study of the nc-AFM contrast of NaCl and a Cl vacancy, it was
shown that the more complicated multipole character of the CO-tip
electric field can be relevant in more strongly ionic systems48 (see SI for details).
We have tested this in the case of hBN by carrying out additional
image simulations. We used a modified version of the probe–particle
model, which calculates the electrostatic forces based on a tip that
consists of a positive dipole accounting for the bulk metallic tip
and a small negative quadrupole moment for the CO (see SI for details of the nc-AFM simulations). These
simulations qualitatively agree with our simpler model and also suggest
that the boron lattice is imaged first at larger tip–sample
distances (see SI for the simulated images
and additional discussion). The fact that already the simple approximation
of a positive point charge yields excellent agreement with experiments
in the case of hBN is most likely due to the different bonding character
compared to NaCl. In the former, the bonds have only small polar character,59 and thus the electric field associated with
the partial atomic charges extends less into the vacuum (in the case
of monolayer hBN/Ir(111), the partial atomic charges are further screened
by the metal). The electrostatic interaction is then dominated by
the long-range positive field of the tip, while its negative part
close to the oxygen is negligible. For the ionic lattice of NaCl and
the vacancy, the electric field extends much more into the vacuum
(for bilayer NaCl there is also less screening compared to monolayer
hBN), and thus the interaction with the oxygen’s localized
negative electric field becomes significant. In addition to these
general trends, the effective strengths of the tip dipole and quadrupole
moments can vary somewhat in different experiments, which further
contributes to the observed contrasts. This suggests that it is important
to consider more realistic tip models for some systems and that, in
particular, cluster-based models should be used with caution.

CO tip for different tip–sample distances, with overlaid hBN
lattice. Large blue circles: nitrogen; small green circles: boron.
The z values indicate the height of the unrelaxed
oxygen atom with respect to the mean height of the hBN layer.

To validate the interpretation
of boron atoms appearing at larger
tip–sample distances than the nitrogens and to provide an additional
data channel for elemental identification, we have also performed
atomically resolved KPFM experiments. We used a CO-passivated tip
to acquire a set of Δf(V)
spectra65 within the area marked with a
red square in Figure 6a and extracted the voltage corresponding to the maximum of the Δf(V) parabola, as shown in the example
spectra in Figure 6d (see Methods for experimental details).
The resulting LCPD map is shown in Figure 6c. In addition, Figure 6b displays a simultaneously recorded nc-AFM
image that allows comparison with the experiments shown in Figure 2 and the nc-AFM simulations
in Figure 5. The LCPD
map shows atomic resolution, with a hexagonal pattern of regions of
more negative LCPD values. The simultaneously recorded nc-AFM image
allows us to match these regions with the sublattice appearing at
larger distances in the nc-AFM images, i.e., the boron atoms according to the image simulations.
Importantly, Figure 6b also shows that the elemental contrast in LCPD is achieved at tip–sample
distances that correspond to only weak atomic contrast in nc-AFM images,
without the necessity to approach the sample into a regime where the
signal is influenced by CO bending, tip–sample junction instabilities,
or Δf(V) spectra deviating
from their expected parabolic shape.53

At these relatively large tip–sample distances, the
LCPD
contrast is predominantly governed by the vertical component of the
electric field of the sample (Ez).65 In this approximation, a more
positive electric field—caused, for example, by partial positive
charges—results in a more negative LCPD. Figure 6e is a map of Ez over the entire moiré unit cell, calculated
from the Hartree potential of our hBN/Ir(111) DFT simulations. The
constant-height slice is taken at 3.8 Å above the mean adsorption
height of the hBN layer, i.e., the
height of the CO tip’s oxygen atom from the nc-AFM image simulation
in Figure 5c, which
shows good agreement in terms of atomic contrast to Figure 6b. The reduced work function
at the depressions of the moiré57 results in a long-range modulation of Ez, with the depressions exhibiting more positive values. Figure 6f is a zoom-in at
the region marked by the red square in Figure 6e, corresponding to the region of the experimental
LCPD map (see Figure 6a). The theoretical map shows similar elemental contrast to the experimental
one, allowing us to identify the regions of more negative LCPD with
the boron sublattice. This finding is consistent with the interpretation
of the nc-AFM images, thus confirming our assignment for the elements
on the two sublattices.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated
elemental contrast in nc-AFM and KPFM images
on monolayer hexagonal boron nitride. Using a passivated tip and a
covalently bonded, inert model surface, our results expand the limits
of elemental identification with state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy.
Most importantly, our method of combining constant-height Δf images and KPFM maps presents a robust method to identify
different chemical species using nc-AFM.

Methods
Experimental
Procedures
Monolayers of hBN on Ir(111)
were grown by low-pressure high-temperature chemical vapor deposition
of borazine (B3N3H6), as described
in detail in ref (57).

All subsequent nc-AFM and STM measurements were carried out
in a Createc LT-STM/AFM, operated at ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and at
a temperature of 5 K. The microscope was equipped with a qPlus66 tuning fork sensor, which had a resonance frequency f0 of ∼30.68 kHz, a quality factor Q of ∼98k, and a stiffness k of ∼1.8 kN/m. For tip functionalization, CO was
dosed from a leak valve attached to the UHV system onto the cold surface,
either Cu(111) or hBN/Ir(111). CO was picked up from Cu(111) as described
previously.67 After successful tip passivation,
the Cu(111) sample was exchanged for the hBN/Ir(111) sample to carry
out the nc-AFM measurements.32 On Ir(111),
CO pickup cannot be carried out as well-controlled as on Cu(111) because
of the strong binding of CO to the Ir surface. Instead, CO pickup
was achieved by scanning an Ir(111) surface with high CO coverage
at relatively harsh feedback parameters, e.g., ∼10 mV sample bias voltage and several tens of
nA tunneling current. This usually led to the transfer of CO from
the surface to the tip apex after some scanning time.

All nc-AFM
images and KPFM maps were recorded in the constant-height
mode with the z-feedback loop disabled and with a
tuning fork oscillation amplitude of 50 pm. The sample bias voltage
for nc-AFM images was 0 V. KPFM measurements were performed by collecting
Δf(V) spectra on a 32 ×
32 grid,65 where each spectrum took 5 s.
The spectra were fitted with second-order polynomials to yield the
voltage corresponding to the maxima of the Δf(V) parabolas. This voltage minimizes the electrostatic
tip–sample forces and is plotted in the LCPD map. Unless stated
otherwise, all nc-AFM and KPFM data are unfiltered raw data.

DFT Calculations
of hBN/Ir(111)
We used the CP2K software
package,68 in particular the QuickStep
module,69 for the DFT calculations of the
structure of hBN/Ir(111). The vdW-DF2-B86r approximation70,71 from the LibXC library72 was employed
for the exchange–correlation term in the Kohn–Sham scheme.
The Gaussian plane wave method73 was used
to solve the electronic structure self-consistently, where the basis
set to expand the wave functions was DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH74 and a cutoff energy of 700 Ry was used for expanding
the density in plane waves, with five grids and a relative cutoff
of 70 Ry. The Goedecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH) type pseudopotentials75 were employed, with 17 valence electrons in
Ir. Only the Γ point was included in the reciprocal space, without
further sampling of the first Brillouin zone. The Fermi–Dirac
broadening of the occupation numbers with a “temperature”
of 300 K was used. We used a 12 × 12-on-11 × 11 unit cell,
in agreement with previous experimental results,57,60 and four layers of Ir(111). Due to the weak interactions and strong
requirement for precision, the convergency criterion on the maximum
force on any ion was set to 0.0514 meV/Å.

DFT Calculations of Different
Tip Models
First-principles
calculations of the different tip models were performed using the
periodic plane-wave basis VASP code76,77 implementing
the spin-polarized DFT. To accurately include van der Waals interactions
in this system, we used the optB86b-vdW-DF functional,78−80 selected based on previous work showing that it provides a sufficiently
accurate description for all subsystems involved in the measurement.
Projected augmented wave potentials were used to describe the core
electrons,81 with a kinetic energy cutoff
of 550 eV (with PREC = accurate). All calculations were performed
with dipole correction to account for spurious electrostatic interactions
between neighboring cells. Systematic k-point convergence
was checked for all periodic systems, with sampling chosen according
to system size. This approach converged the total energy of all the
systems to the order of meV. The properties of the bulk and surface
of Cu, Ir, the isolated structure of CO, and its adsorption on Cu
and Ir were carefully checked within this methodology, and excellent
agreement was achieved with experiments. A vacuum gap of at least
1.5 nm was used in general, with larger gaps to study the tip potentials.
All systems considered were relaxed until the atomic forces were less
than 0.01 eV/Å.

The tips’ electrostatic field was
calculated by exploring the electrostatic potential from the DFT simulations.
The average electrostatic potential in x–y was calculated as a function of z for
each tip model. Beyond the tip apex, this rapidly converges to a constant
slope (which reflects the compensation of the electrostatic interactions
across the periodic cells and is directly correlated with the tip
dipole82). While the absolute value of
this slope is not particularly meaningful, it gives a clear relative
measure of the effective electric field at long range. For comparison,
the conventionally calculated total dipole in the z-direction for each model is shown in the SI, and it shows the same trends across different classes of tip.

nc-AFM Image Simulations
nc-AFM simulations were based
on the probe particle model,34,35,41 widely used to model the nc-AFM imaging process with functionalized
tips,14 as implemented in the MechAFM code.62 The probe consists of a fixed C atom holder
connected to an O atom restrained in the xy-plane
by a harmonic spring. The tip–sample interactions were calculated
by placing the tip in several locations above the DFT-optimized structure
of hBN/Ir(111) and relaxing the tip O termination. The interatomic
interactions between O and the atomic species of the sample are described
by Lennard-Jones potentials. For C and O atoms, we used the CHARMM
force field parameters.83 For B and N atoms,
the parameters from Hilder etal.,84 derived for the interaction of boron
nitride nanotubes with water (H2O), were used. Parameters
for pair potentials were obtained using arithmetic mixing rules from
the atomic ones. In addition, the MechAFM code allows for inclusion
of electrostatic forces by assigning a charge to the O atom and letting
it interact with the Hartree potential of the sample as obtained from
DFT. Frequency shift images were calculated from the tip–sample
interaction maps using the method in ref (1), assuming for the O atom a harmonic spring stiffness
of 0.5 N/m and a charge of 0.5, 0, or −0.5e. The probe particle model including more complicated tip electrostatics
is discussed in the SI.
