Membranes that selectively filter
for both anions and cations are
central to technological applications from clean energy generation
to desalination devices. 2D materials have immense potential as these
ion-selective membranes due to their thinness, mechanical strength,
and tunable surface chemistry; however, currently, only cation-selective
membranes have been reported. Here we demonstrate the controllable
cation and anion selectivity of both monolayer graphene and hexagonal
boron nitride. In particular, we measure the ionic current through
membranes grown by chemical vapor deposition containing well-known
defects inherent to scalably produced and wet-transferred 2D materials.
We observe a striking change from cation selectivity with monovalent
ions to anion selectivity by controlling the concentration of multivalent
ions and inducing charge inversion on the 2D membrane. Furthermore,
we find good agreement between our experimental data and theoretical
predictions from the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation and
use this model to extract selectivity ratios. These tunable selective
membranes conduct up to 500 anions for each cation and thus show potential
for osmotic power generation.

==== Body
The pressing
global need to
improve technologies for generating clean energy and water desalination
has triggered a flurry of research into porous ion-exchange membranes.
Within these technologies, semipermeable membranes are used to separate
two electrolytes and subsequently perform electrical, mechanical,
or chemical work on the ionic flow. For example, ion-exchange membranes
have been used as a component in electrodialysis and reverse osmosis
(RO) processes1 to desalinate and extract
precious metal from wastewater. Both processes, however, are nonequilibrium
because they require water to be driven through the membrane either
electrically or by pressure, which is energy-intensive and thus limits
their net output efficiency. Recent innovations in energy recovery
systems have decreased the net energy consumption for pressure-driven
RO by doing work with pressurized outputs;2 however, developing more energetically efficient processes is key
to the future of these technologies.3

Emergent technologies such as pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse
electrodialysis minimize this problem even further by using a salinity
gradient to drive ion flow, requiring no active fluid pumping. In
both cases, a low resistance membrane is essential;4 however, for reverse electrodialysis, a stack of both cation-
and anion-selective membranes is required to generate power.5 The performance of a membrane within these applications
thus heavily depends on key metrics including the thickness of the
membrane, the surface chemistry, and the pore distribution. 2D materials
such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can be tailored
to meet many of these requirements, making them ideal candidates for
use as ion-exchange membranes.6 For example,
their atomic thinness results in not only a decrease in resistance
against fluid flux but also an intrinsic flexibility. In the case
of graphene, the purely carbon composition makes surface functionalization
relatively straightforward.7 Control over
surface properties is of particular interest because the selectivity
of ion transport in 2D materials has been shown to arise predominantly
due to extrinsic charging effects.8−10 As such, changing the
charge polarity of the membrane potentially allows for manipulation
of the magnitude and charge specificity of the membrane selectivity.
This could provide a route to the anion-selective membranes required
by power generation applications that are presently absent in the
literature, in marked contrast with multiple previous demonstrations
of cation selectivity.

A further challenge arises because, although
some disagree with this notion,11 it is almost universally accepted that the introduction
of pores is critical to facilitating ionic transport. This is required
because pristine graphene is impermeable to atoms as small as helium.12 Whereas precisely fabricated pores are a popular
choice for preparing porous membranes, the helium ion or electron
beam processes used to create the pores come with significant overhead
in cost, time, and yield.13,14 Recently, however,
selective transport has been demonstrated for chemical-vapor-deposited
(CVD) membranes8 which can be produced
at scale and high throughput.15−17 Transport here is due to defects
inherent to current large-area CVD and linked wet-transfer processes,18 removing the necessity for arduous pore-creation
processes. Moreover, larger scale treatments for the controlled expansion
of intrinsic defects are under development.19−21 To fully exploit
these materials, however, further efforts toward the characterization
of the distribution of intrinsic defects and their contribution to
selectivity is required, which is currently lacking.

Here we
show anion-selective behavior in both monolayer CVD graphene
and monolayer hBN suspended on aqueous media. We use CVD materials,
which, except for a standard wet transfer, are not further processed.
Therefore, we are not deliberately introducing defects but are assessing
transport across typical defects alone. Our membranes are characterized
using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and in situ Raman spectroscopy and by conductance measurements.
We build a framework for studying ionic transport through defects
by sealing 2D membranes onto quartz nanocapillaries22 that are used to contact and manipulate the materials (Figure 1a). Electrical contact
on both sides of the membrane allows current and voltage characteristics
to be measured across the membrane from which selectivity can then
be determined. We find that multivalent salts such as hafnium tetrachloride
(HfCl4) cause membranes to exhibit anion selectivity. This
anion selectivity is most likely the effect of surface charge reversal23−25 by the multivalent ion, with a change from negative to positive
surface charge causing a change from cation to anion selectivity.
Moreover, anion selectivity of the membrane is also observed in monovalent
salts—systems previously shown to exhibit cation-selective
behavior—if a low background concentration of multivalent ions
is added to the solution. We model membrane performance using Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz
(GHK)26 relations and provide a quantitative
analysis of selectivity. There are stark differences in the chemical
makeup and electrical characteristics between graphene and hBN; therefore,
in studying transport across two monolayer materials, commonly observed
phenomena indicate universality, supporting the isolation of their
cause to extrinsic factors. Finally, to demonstrate the relevance
of our system for technological applications, we calculate key metrics
to assess the performance of these selective membranes as applied
ion-exchange membranes.

of ions through a charged membrane driven by a salinity gradient alone.

electrode with a graphene membrane sealed onto the tip. The opposing

(red arrow) by a nanopore in the graphene membrane are shown (not
drawn to scale). (b) Selective drift current is measured for imposed
concentration gradients across membranes with different surface charges.
The net drift current is shown in each case, with black arrows indicating
the direction and magnitude of diffusive flow for: (i) an anion-selective
membrane, (ii) a membrane between reservoirs of equal concentrations
resulting in no net diffusive flux, and (iii) a cation-selective membrane.

Results and Discussion
The method
used to interface 2D membranes is described in the Experimental Methods and summarized in brief in Figure 1a. A quartz nanocapillary
(nominal diameter ∼150 nm) is filled with saline solution and
used to seal onto and pick up a piece of 2D material. The effect of
the capillaries on ion selectivity is deemed negligible through a
series of control experiments in the absence of a membrane.8In situ Raman spectroscopy (illustrated
with a green laser) enables on-the-fly characterization of graphene.
The capillary acts as a fixed cis reservoir that is then immersed
into external trans reservoirs containing a variety of salts, exposing
the sealed 2D material to distinct saline solutions. To establish
membrane conductance and measure ionic transport, an amplifier is
connected across the membrane using silver–silver/chloride
electrodes. With this, voltages can be applied and the current can
be monitored across the membrane and vice versa.
The conductance of the capillary without the membrane is used to establish
the size of the nanometer opening of the capillary, and the subsequent
change in conductance upon contact with the 2D material gives an indication
of the adherence of a 2D material on the capillary.

Transport
across the 2D materials depends on the surface functionalization
and charge, both termed extrinsic effects. Electrostatic charging
of the surfaces of 2D materials on water has been demonstrated, with
estimates for graphene on water13 as −0.6
and −0.16 C/m2 for hBN.27 Such extrinsic charging on both materials is most likely due to
hydroxide adsorption,28 and this surface
charge will determine the behavior of the nanopore with respect to
its electrostatic interactions with ions in solution. In Figure 1b, we illustrate
the expected scenarios for ion flow through a charged semipermeable
membrane separating two ionic solutions, analogous to the system in Figure 1a. Because diffusion
drives ion flow down a salinity gradient, both cations and anions
will tend to flow from a lower to a higher concentration. However,
an imposed concentration gradient across the selective membrane results
in the diffusive flow of predominately one type of ion. This net movement
of either the cations or the anions in the system results in the observation
of a current, with the current thus directly reflecting the selective
behavior of the membrane. Note that here, for no driving voltage or
current, measured voltages and currents are a result of the selective
flux of ions down their concentration gradient alone.

The selective
current will result in a reversal potential, Vrev, forming across the membrane, governed by
the Nernst equation 1  where Ctrans and Ccis are the concentrations
in the trans/cis
reservoirs respectively, R denotes the gas constant, T is the temperature, z is the ion valency, F is Faraday’s constant, and S is
the percentage of selectivity. The reversal potential indicates the
potential that must be applied across the membrane to oppose the selective
flux of ions arising from a concentration gradient. From eq 1, a system that is perfectly selective
(S = 1) toward either the cation or anion in a monovalent
species at 300 K would have an absolute reversal potential of 59.5
mV per decade molar concentration ratio (M) (mV/log(M)). Note that, a perfectly selective membrane toward anions
will be permeable for anions and impermeable toward cations. For most
systems, the membrane will not be perfectly selective; that is, there
will also be some flux of the counterion across the membrane that
will reduce the measured current. Here the measurement of the reversal
potential can be used to quantify how close the membrane reaches the
perfectly selective case.

To explore this further, Figure 1b.i presents possible
scenarios for transport across
a charged membrane. A positive surface charge will result in a higher
population of anions around the pore region, and thus transport through
the pore is more preferential to anions, with only a fraction of cations
also flowing (black arrows). The amount of cation flux across this
otherwise anion-selective pore will depend on the pore’s selectivity
ratio. On the basis of this, a current measured with no applied driving
potential would be positive when the cis concentration ([cis]) is
less than the trans concentration ([trans]) and negative when [cis]
> [trans]. The reversal potential, when the current is zero, should
be negative for [cis] < [trans] and positive when [cis] > [trans]. Figure 1b.ii shows a pore
with no salinity gradient across it, resulting in no net diffusive
flow and rendering the pore nonselective. In measurements using our
system, the case of equal cis and trans concentrations that should
correspond to no measured current is used as a calibration point.
Finally, Figure 1b.iii
considers the case of a negatively charged surface, which results
in cation-selective behavior. Applying similar logic, the negative
surface charge will result in a higher population of cations around
the pore, thus making their transport across the pore more likely.
In this case, when [cis] < [trans], the current will be negative,
and when [cis] > [trans], the current will be positive. Similarly,
the reversal potential should be positive for [cis] < [trans] and
negative when [cis] > [trans]. These scenarios thus outline how
the
drift current and the potential across the membrane resulting from
the asymmetrical ion flow are direct quantifiers of selectivity.

Current–voltage (I–V) curves are measured for the system with different concentration
gradients across the membrane. For each capillary, at least three I–V curves are recorded at each
trans concentration, sampled at 10 mV steps, which are subsequently
averaged, with error bars representing the spread in the data. (See
the Experimental Methods.) An illustrated
example of processing data from I–V curves to selectivity ratios is presented in the Supporting Information (SI), section S1. To assess
the degree of the selectivity, we extract the current and voltage
intercepts from I–V curves
for a fixed cis concentration. These are then presented as a function
of the trans concentration. The voltage intercepts are a direct measure
of the built-up membrane potential, or the reversal potential, as
expressed by eq 1. In
line with this equation, we find a linear behavior of the reversal
potential with changing the trans concentration on a log–linear
scale. Inspection of eq 1 shows that the slope of this line should be directly related to
the percentage selectivity, S. As such, gradients
of the linear fits are used to provide a measure of the selectivity
as the change in reversal potential with concentration (mV/log[M]).
The gradient of the current–concentration plot (nA/log[M])
confirms the direction of the selectivity and provides an idea of
the selective ionic flux across the pore(s). Here a negative gradient
in the plot of the reversal voltage against [trans] corresponds to
a positive selective current gradient (from the definition of conventional
current) and thus indicates anion selectivity. The opposite behavior
would be expected for cation-selective membranes. The direction of
these gradients directly establishes which ions are diffusing across
the membrane, whereas the magnitude of the gradient indicates the
degree of this selectivity.

In Figure 2a, we
explore the effect of a solution of HfCl4 containing multivalent
ions on the selectivity of monolayer graphene. Each line in the figure
represented a different cis concentration for the same set of trans
concentrations. Here the negative gradient in the plot of voltage
offset versus concentration, or voltage selectivity (Figure 2a.i), shows that the membrane
transport is dominated by chloride ions in all cases. We therefore
find that anion-selective transport dominates in a system with HfCl4. Furthermore, the magnitude of the slope, and thus the degree
of anion selectivity, increases as the cis concentration decreases.
From the extracted slopes and eq 1, the selectivity percentage, S, can be obtained.
At 100 and 10 mM [cis], selectivity is at 82 and 88% of the theoretical
maximum, respectively. Notably, selectivity reaches the theoretical
maximum (S = 1) for a cis concentration of 1 mM.
The current is further evidence of anion selectivity; however, here
the magnitude appears to not significantly depend on the cis concentrations.
Note that the same behavior is seen with another tetravalent ionic
solution, zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4), as shown in
the SI, section S2. Moreover, hBN responds
identically to that of graphene, as shown in the SI, section S3. All salt solutions used are unbuffered with
measured conductivities and pH values that are presented in the SI, section S4.

Figure 2 Tunable ion selectivity in different salt
solutions. (a) HfCl4 in cis and trans reservoirs. (i) Voltage
offset as a function
of the trans concentration for different cis concentrations, all indicating
anion selectivity. The gradients of each line are given in the legend
with the largest magnitude gradient for [cis] = 1 mM. The anion-selective
current (ii) is similar across all cis concentrations. (b) Corresponding
data for KCl showing in all cases the expected cation-selective behavior.
(c) Voltage and current offsets for 100 mM KCl with a low background
concentration of HfCl4 showing a change in the selectivity
from cation to anion with increasing concentration of HfCl4.

For comparison, in Figure 2b, we show the equivalent behavior
for cis and trans reservoirs
filled with varying concentrations of KCl only. Here, as in previous
reports,7,9,13,29−32 transport is predominantly controlled by potassium
ions, and, as such, plots of the voltage offset versus trans concentration
all have a positive gradient. As with HfCl4, the magnitude
of the slope increases with decreasing cis concentration, although
here the magnitudes are somewhat smaller than those for the multivalent
case. In particular, we observe at 100 mM a selectivity of 64%, at
10 mM a selectivity of 75%, and the highest selectivity of 90% (S = 0.9) of the theoretical maximum for 1 mM in the cis
reservoir. Our result is consistent with other observations8 that note that selectivity is largely controlled
by the highest ion concentration, as this alters the Debye screening
length and thus the selectivity, which is yet another indication that
the selectivity is due to extrinsic effects.

In light of the
picture of selective transport outlined in Figure 1b, the contrasting
behavior of the systems in Figure 2a,b suggests that whereas in the monovalent salt the
membrane maintains a negative charge, with multivalent ions, the membrane
instead develops a net positive charge. To further explore the effect
of multivalent ions on positively charging the surface of the graphene,
we now consider the effect on the selective transport in KCl of a
small background concentration of HfCl4. Figure 2c shows data from a system
with 100 mM KCl in the cis reservoir and varying KCl concentrations
in the trans reservoir with an addition of low concentrations of HfCl4. With an addition of 0.01 mM HfCl4, cation selectivity
is observed, and at the same magnitude as seen without the addition
of HfCl4 (green data in Figure 2b). Interestingly, however, at an addition
of 1 mM HfCl4 to 100 mM KCl, a switch to anion selectivity
is seen despite there being no gradient in HfCl4 concentration
across the system. Thus chloride ion filtration is shown with KCl
by the use of a small but constant HfCl4 background. The
implication is that 1 mM HfCl4 is sufficient to alter the
graphene surface charge from negative to positive.23,24 The mechanism by which this occurs is referred to as charge inversion23,24 and, as an extrinsic process, is not a phenomena exclusive to 2D
membranes. Furthermore, the reversibility of this inversion of surface
charge implies that the process is purely electrostatic, as opposed
to a surface chemical effect.

The crossover point from cation-
to anion-selective behavior occurs
between the addition of 0.1 and 1 mM of HfCl4. Whereas
the crossover concentration has previously not been determined for
mixtures of monovalent and tetravalent ions, the crossover concentration
in our experiments is consistent with that found for trivalent ions,
where a crossover, or a point of charge inversion, has been observed
at ∼0.2 mM.24 Moreover, in repeating
our experiment with trivalent salts, CeCl3 and LaCl3, we observe a point of charge inversion from cation to anion
selectivity between 1 and 10 mM, with the decrease in value compared
with that in the literature perhaps accounted for by differences between
the inherent surface charge of the silica beads used in Dekker et
al.24 as opposed to the graphene surface
used here; see the SI, section S5.

Considering the concentration ratio, that is, [cis]/[trans], across
a range of fixed cis values gives a more holistic overall view of
performance. Furthermore, this allows for a selectivity ratio to be
extracted from GHK equations as a function of the concentration ratio
and the ionic valency alone. This parameter provides a more ready
comparison of selective flux for systems for which the direction and
magnitude of selectivity differ. The GHK equation describes ionic
flux across a membrane, as quantified by the transmembrane potential
in terms of the ionic concentration ratio and the membrane selectivity
ratio.26 For the simplest case of a symmetric
monovalent ion 2  where R and F are the molar gas
and Faraday constants, respectively, T is the temperature, C is the concentration, and Pcat/an is the selectivity ratio of cations relative
to that of anions. To apply this model to multivalent ions, an expanded
form of the equation is used. (See the SI, section S6.) Figure 3 presents combined experimental data (symbols) for systems with monovalent,
multivalent, and mixtures of ions across a variety of cis/trans concentrations
against the respective fit to the full GHK equation. Using nonlinear
regression, the experimental values are fit to the GHK with the selectivity
ratio (Pcat/an) as the only fitting parameter.
This ratio is quoted either as Pcat/an or as its reciprocal, Pan/cat, for cation-
and anion-selective systems, respectively. Whereas the GHK equation
is based on a number of assumptions (see the SI, section S6), the good level of agreement with our experimental
data suggests that this model provides a valid description of the
underlying physical processes in our experiments. Overall, the experimental
data for all systems are well modeled by applying the GHK theory,
which has been expanded to handle tetravalent ions. This implies that
the transport observed adheres to electrodiffusion, as described by
Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) with the assumptions discussed
in the SI, section S6.

Figure 3 Selectivity ratio according
to the GHK equation. Data from different
cis concentration systems are combined, and an overall GHK fit is
shown with the selectivity ratio as the fitting parameter and with
experimental error shown as error bars. Legends indicate the salt
in cis and trans (a) HfCl4 is shown to be ∼400 times
more selective to anions over cations. (b) With KCl, the membrane
is cation-selective with a ratio of 12. (c) With the addition of 1
mM HfCl4 to KCl, the membrane is anion-selective with a
ratio of ∼500 times more selective toward anions. (d) An addition
of less HfCl4 (0.01 mM) preserved the cation selectivity
seen with KCl, with a selective ratio toward cations of ∼22.

The striking contrast in the GHK fit between HfCl4 in Figure 3a and KCl in Figure 3b is immediately
clear, supporting our findings of anion- and cation-selective behavior,
respectively. The magnitude of the selectivity ratio also differs
between the systems. With HfCl4, the system exhibits a
selectivity ratio of 400 toward anions, whereas this drops to 15 with
KCl. The selectivity we observe for KCl is broadly consistent with
other observations in literature.8,13,33 From Figure 2a, it can seen that by using HfCl4, as opposed
to KCl, the system exhibits increased selective ion flux at lower
cis concentrations. This leads to an increase by an order of magnitude
in ion selectivity compared with KCl, consistent with the fits shown
here. The magnitude of selectivity toward K+ ions is maintained
with the addition of 0.01 mM HfCl4 to a 100 mM KCl cis
reservoir (Figure 3c), not significantly affecting the selectivity ratio at 22. However,
increasing the concentration of HfCl4 to 1 mM in Figure 3d switches the selectivity
to anion-selective, despite the lack of a gradient of HfCl4 across the system. Surprisingly, with the addition of the higher
concentration of HfCl4, the selectivity toward anions from
a gradient of KCl is now an order of magnitude higher, at 500, compared
with the selectivity toward cations.

Having shown that by altering
extrinsic charging effects we are
able to tune ion selectivity across graphene and hBN, we now address
the mode of passage through the membranes. It has previously been
implied that transport occurs via intrinsic defects.8,34,35 To better assess these potential
pathways, in situ Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, and
membrane conductance are used. These characterization methods, with
the exception of membrane, are more readily applied to graphene than
to other 2D materials; however, here we assume that measuring similar
membrane conductance data from both materials implies similar defect
distributions, as determined for graphene by other direct measures
such as TEM and Raman spectroscopy. Figure 4a shows some typical Raman spectra for monolayer
graphene suspended on an electrolyte solution, with different spectra
coming from distinct graphene membranes on a identical electrolyte;
each spectrum is an accumulation of several repeated spectra. The
spectra show a prominent 2D peak at 2685 cm–1 and
a G peak at 1597 cm–1, the intensity ratio of which
is ∼2.1, indicative of a monolayer sample.36 The presence of the D peak at 1347 cm–1 is indicative of defects within graphene, with further characterization
of graphene and hBN in the SI, section
S7. Defects could take the form of large cracks or a collection of
smaller scale defects referred to as edge defects. Given the nature
of how the material is both fabricated and characterized, this peak
is most likely attributed to a collection of smaller scale edge defects.36 When coupled with optimized transfer and interface
cleaning, CVD-grown material, as used in this Article, has been shown
to have as high a mobility as “pristine” exfoliated
flakes.37 We would speculate that the most
likely origin of intrinsic defects is due to standard wet-transfer
methods, as used here.

Figure 4 Membrane and pore characterization in graphene. (a) Raman
spectra
showing prominent 2D (2685 cm–1), G (1597 cm–1), and D (1347 cm–1) peaks with
a 2D/G intensity ratio of 2.1, which is indicative of defected monolayer
graphene. Raman spectra were captured in situ with
graphene suspended on a salt solution. Multiple spectra taken at different
points for a sample of graphene floating on KCl are shown. (b) Post-exit-wave-reconstruction
HRTEM phase images showing various regions of the graphene sample:
(i) Stone–Wales defects are circled, (ii,iii) defected regions
are shown, and (iv) defected regions are shown to have areas equivalent
to a ∼3 nm circular pore. Scale bar: 5 nm. (c) Distribution
of the summed total circular defect area, which could account for
the experimentally observed selective currents.

Because defects within an otherwise impenetrable membrane provide
the only pathway for charge to flow38 further
characterization of the inherent defects is important. To this end,
HRTEM is used on graphene samples prepared identically to those used
in experiments. Some representative post-exit-wave-reconstructed images
(SI, section S8) are shown in Figure 4b. Figure 4b.i shows an area of graphene
where the hexagonal order of the lattice is seen alongside single
atomic vacancy defects and some lattice disordering, referred to as
Stone–Wales defects (red circles). These defects are, however,
too small to account for selective ionic transport.9Figure 4b.ii,iii shows examples of larger intrinsic defects that could facilitate
selective ionic transport. The area of these defects is ∼8
to 9 nm2, corresponding to an equivalent diameter of ∼3
nm for a circular defect, as shown in Figure 4b.iv.

High-resolution microscopy is
a powerful tool but provides only
a limited view, making the extraction of large-scale statistics for
the material difficult. Furthermore, it should be noted that TEM imaging
is not carried out in situ and thus is not a direct
characterization of defects through which we measure selective currents
but instead is a characterization of the membrane as identically used
in selectivity measurements. Therefore, for both a larger scale and
a more direct quantification of such defects, an empirical approach
based on the membrane conductivity is used. The conductivity is measured
by taking the resistance from I–V curves for a fixed salt concentration and fixed membrane area. The
contributing resistance from the capillary is subtracted (see the SI, section S9) from this to leave the conductivity
of the membrane alone. Unlike TEM, this approach considers the whole
membrane area and thus provides an indication of the sum total defect
area across the sample. To relate the conductivity of the membrane
to the density of defects, we first assume that we can approximate
the conductivity through many smaller defects by that through a single
larger pore with an area equal to the sum of the areas of all individual
defects. For a single circular pore, the following empirical equation
can be used to estimate the conductance as39 3  where σ is the solution
conductivity, t is the membrane thickness (taken
as 0.6 nm for graphene
on water39), and D is
the pore diameter. From ∼130 selective membrane samples, the
conductance is measured, and from this, an estimate of the size of
the pore that would be required to account for the observed conductance
is determined from eq 3. In Figure 4c, we
plot the distribution of equivalent pore sizes for these samples.
Over half of selective membrane samples show ionic flux accountable
by defects of diameter 5 nm or smaller, which is consistent with the
observed defects in the HRTEM images. Moreover ∼75% of samples
exhibit conductivities consistent with a total defect area equivalent
to a 10 nm diameter circular pore or smaller. (See the SI, section S9 for a discussion of the analysis.)
Having sealed onto a membrane, measurements of no appreciable conductance
did not occur. Because pristine graphene is impermeable to ions and
ionic conduction exclusively occurs through the sealed membrane, leakage
around the rim of the capillary is negligible if present, and we assume
that the observed selective flux is through these defects, although
the lack of experimental in situ imaging means that
one can only infer that these pores are the selective current pathways.

Despite much recent literature providing theoretical and experimental
evidence of selectivity within pores larger than those accounted for
by Debye overlap, notions that an obligatory condition for selectivity
is that the Debye screening length in the system is comparable to
the pore size still persist.40−43 However, in our experiments, we observe selectivity
in pores with an equivalent diameter of up to ∼30 nm despite
Debye lengths that can be as short as ∼0.3 nm for the monovalent
electrolyte and ∼0.1 nm for the tetravalent electrolyte.44 (See the SI, section
S10 for Debye screening lengths in our system.) Because of how we
measure conductance, the equivalent pore size could also be made up
of many smaller defects; we note that based on the selectivity, we
observe that these singular defects should be <3 nm.8 If the selectivity we observe originated from
larger pores, then the observations would not be fully described by
Debye overlap. Because the selectivity is not limited by the size
of the ion, it is also not attributable to steric effects; see the SI, section S10. However, Poggioli et al.45 have shown that surface conductance plays a
key role in generating ion selectivity, a phenomenon governed by Dukhin
length overlap. It is known that the surface conductance of 2D materials
is heavily affected by their substrate,46−48 and, in keeping with
this, we see Raman spectra of graphene on various concentrations of
KCl/HfCl4, which show positive/negative shifts in 2D and
G peaks, indicating negative/positive surface charges, respectively;
refer to the SI, section S11. A full exploration
of the Dukhin length in our system would require a more careful characterization
of the surface conductance, which is beyond the scope of this work.
However, within this theoretical framework, selectivity has been previously
demonstrated for pores measuring up to 100 nm, as reported by Rollings
et al.13 among others,43,49 which would be consistent with our results. A key consequence of
this is that the defects studied in this work could potentially be
expanded (for example, by ozone treatment3,8,14 or chemical etching8,50)
closer to 100 nm while maintaining the selectivity. This would increase
the fluid flux through the pores, increasing the selective flux and
thus any potentially generated osmotic power using this system.

Finally, to assess the membrane performance for applications in
power generation, in Figure 5, we show the selectivity ratios as a function of the cis
reservoir concentration and a projection of the osmotic power generation
for all considered systems. Here in Figure 5a, in contrast with Figure 3, the GHK-derived selectivity is extracted
and shown separately for each cis reservoir concentration. (For individual
analytical fits, see the SI, section S12).
Given that the magnitude of selectivity is affected not just by the
concentration ratio but also by the absolute value of the cis concentration,
the determination of the maximum obtainable selectivity ratio, as
opposed to the mean, requires systems with different cis concentrations
to be considered separately. Figure 5a also shows, once again, the striking change from
a cation-selective regime with KCl to an anion-selective with HfCl4, with a clear transition point in mixed environments. The
highest selectivity ratios are achieved in systems with 100 mM in
the [cis] reservoir. Importantly, it is clear that the performance
of hBN is comparable to that of graphene. The insulating nature of
hBN, the reduced order of atomic symmetry, and the different chemical
composition present it as a contrasting 2D material to graphene. Because
the system with hBN responds in a way consistent with that of graphene,
we can assume that the ionic transport phenomena are extrinsic to
the 2D materials themselves and are more dominated by the surface
effects.

Figure 5 Selectivity ratios and power generation within our system. (a)
KCl is shown as cation-selective with a higher selectivity ratio for
a cis concentration of 100 mM. The addition of 0.01 mM HfCl4 maintains cation selectivity; however, 1 mM switches to anion-selective.
HfCl4 is anion-selective with a high selectivity ratio
of ∼500. The behavior for both graphene and hBN is shown, showing
a similar preference in both materials. (b) KCl and HfCl4 power generation as a function of the concentration ratio using
graphene are compared. HfCl4 can generate >100 kW/m2, whereas the figure is lower at 10 kW/m2 with
KCl.

Within a would-be application
such as the extraction of energy
from ionic flux, Figure 5b presents the osmotic power that could be generated using our system.
The osmotic power values we measure for KCl are nominally in the region
of 103 W/m2, peaking at 104 W/m2, which agrees with previous calculations for a similar system.8,49 Compared with KCl, the power extracted from HfCl4 increases
by 10–100 times, a significant increase, as expected from the
selectivity ratios shown in Figure 5a. Reaching a peak of 105 W/m2 potential osmotic power, this system compares favorably to the performance
in enlarged graphene defects and to commercial Nafion membranes.8 Recently, using methods of enhancing transport
through pores, Graf et al.19 estimate the
extraction of 160 pW per 10 nm milled pores in MoS2, which
is on the order of 105 W/m2 (depending on the
assumed pore distribution). Our system thus provides comparable power
values, and an increase seems possible if the pore size and surface
charge are optimized in the future.

Conclusions
We
have shown that multivalent ions can be used to alter the surface
charge on 2D membranes, allowing for tunable anion/cation selectivity.
By measuring the current across membranes sealed onto glass nanocapillaries
in a variety of salt conditions, the magnitude and direction of selectivity
have been established. Because extrinsic charge effects are known
to significantly influence the selectivity across 2D membranes, this
suggests that the negative charge on the 2D membrane surface and thus
around the pore is altered by multivalent ions such that the transport
of anions is preferential to cations. We find that this effect can
be induced in monovalent salts by the addition of a multivalent salt.
The immediate implication is that the magnitude and direction of ion
selectivity can be controlled and tuned extrinsically. The development
of anion-selective membranes is a crucial step in furthering the understanding
of surface charge interactions as well as allowing for direct application
in cation/anion-selective stacked systems. Thus our finding provides
potential for the use of 2D materials as ion-exchange membranes. We
infer that selective transport in our system could be due to pores
similar to imaged defects intrinsic to transferred CVD membranes,
removing the requirement for laborious pore creation techniques. We
imaged defects for as-grown graphene on the order of ∼3 nm,
and even for these relatively small defects, the correlated selectivity
to membrane conductance shows that a high level of selective salt
permeability can be achieved coupled to a lower fluid resistance.
Anion selectivity is found to persist at high salt concentrations,
increasing the potential osmotic power generated using these systems.
Moreover, we have shown that lower conductance membranes, and thus
those with enlarged defects, could remain selective and so could provide
even lower fluid resistance. As such, moving forward, surface treatments
allowing for the defects to be enlarged up to 100 nm, increasing the
ionic flux across the membranes, would make these systems even more
attractive in technological applications. Moreover, in situ high-resolution imagery with live selectivity experiments would
directly characterize pores and correlate them with an associated
selectivity, further elucidating selective current pathways in 2D
membranes.

Experimental Methods
Graphene Preparation
Monolayer graphene was produced
in a cold-wall CVD reactor (AIXTRON BM Pro 4) using 99.8% 25 μm
thick copper foil (Alfa-Aesar) as a catalyst. The copper was cleaned
in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) before being partially oxidized
prior to synthesis. The synthesis procedure consisted of annealing
at 1070 °C in 50 mbar of argon for 30 min before being exposed
to 50 mbar of a 4000:1000:1 Ar/H2/CH4 gas mixture
for 90 min, resulting in full coverage of the copper foil by graphene
(>99% monolayer, grain-size >100 μm diameter51), confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw
inVia) and
scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM) (FEI Magellan 400), respectively;
see the SI, section S7.

Hexagonal Boron
Nitride Preparation
hBN material was
grown similarly to the methods previously reported.52 In brief, iron foils (100 μm, Goodfellow, 99.8%)
were cleaned in acetone and IPA and loaded into a custom cold-wall
CVD system with a graphite heater. The temperature was ramped to 940
°C at 50 °C/min, and the foils were annealed in an ammonia
atmosphere (4 mbar, 5 min). For the hBN synthesis, borazine was added
as a precursor (10–3 mbar, 5 min), and the system
was rapidly cooled (200 °C/min initially) by turning off the
heater. An electrochemical bubbling transfer method53 was used to deposit hBN films onto SiO2 substrates
for Raman characterization. See the SI for
further details and characterization.

Membrane Transfer
For graphene grown on copper, as
described, a PMMA supporting layer was used to etch the copper using
ammonium persulfate, and the subsequent PMMA–graphene layer
was transferred onto cleaved KCl chips. Acetone and IPA washes were
used to remove PMMA. Meanwhile, for hBN, a PMMA-free method involving
an electrochemical process53 was used to
cleave onto KCl chips. Finally, gold strips were evaporated through
a shadow mask onto the graphene/hBN to serve as optical guiding lines
and a supporting framework.

Fluidic Cell Preparation
Quartz
capillaries (Sutter)
with a 0.5 mm/0.3 mm (inner/outer) diameter were sonicated in ethanol
for 10 min before drying under a nitrogen stream and baking at 60
°C to remove residual ethanol. Capillaries were pulled to a nominal
inner diameter of 150 nm using a laser-assisted puller (Sutter P-2000).
The expected morphology and pore diameter were confirmed by SEM; see
the SI for images and the pore-size distribution.
Back-end of capillaries were submerged in to desired salt solution
and placed in a vacuum desiccator to induce capillary filling. Filled
capillaries were inserted into a holder (Axopatch Holder with Suction
Port), which could be mounted to an Axopatch head stage.

Ion Selectivity
Measurements
The experimental setup
is shown in Figure 1a. Graphene and other 2D membranes were contacted using quartz capillaries
with a 150 nm circular opening. The capillaries were first filled
with a salt solution, forming the cis chamber. This was then sealed
by a 2D material, forming a free-standing structure. The sealed capillary
was exposed to different external salt solutions, forming the trans
reservoir. Thus the material was exposed to a fixed salt in the capillary
and a variable trans salt, allowing for the introduction of a salt
concentration gradient across the membrane. Disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes
were made by submerging pure silver wire in sodium hypochlorite for
at least 1 h. Electrodes were placed on either side of the graphene
membrane, one in the capillary holder (cis) and the other exposed
to a salt solution (trans). To eliminate redox potentials54 due to salinary gradients at the trans electrode,
a matched agarose salt bridge was used. The electrodes were connected
to the head stage of an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Molecular
Devices). All current measurements were subject to an internal amplifier
Bessel filter at 10 kHz, recording at 20 kHz; each current step was
recorded for 1 s with a 500 ms settling time. Preceding selectivity
measurements, the amplifier voltage offset was calibrated using symmetric
salt conditions. DC voltages were applied in steps of 20 mV from up
to −200 to 200 mV, and the current was measured.

Data Analysis
Multiple I–V curves were
recorded for each data point; these were averaged,
and a standard error was extracted. A linear fit was then applied
to the I–V measurements,
extracting reversal potentials and leakage currents. A plot of the
reversal potentials and leakage currents against the trans concentration
was used to extract the gradient of a linear fit, exposing the measures
of selectivity. Additionally, the measured reversal potentials were
used to estimate ion selectivity according to the expanded GHK equation
(SI, section S6) using nonlinear regression.
Standard errors were used as weights in the regression, with a standard
error found for the fitting parameter.

Imaging
HRTEM
imaging was taken using the TEAM 0.5
microscope at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This microscope
achieves high resolution through spherical aberration correction and
a monochromatic beam. The microscope was operated at 80 kV to prevent
knock-on damage of the graphene sample. Through-focal series images
were taken from −50 to 50 nm about the focal plane. Exit wave
reconstruction (see the SI, section S8)
was used for the through focal series to produce HRTEM images.
