The
tunable properties of molecular materials place them among the favorites
for a variety of future generation devices. In addition, to maintain
the current trend of miniaturization of those devices, a departure
from the present top-down production methods may soon be required
and self-assembly appears among the most promising alternatives. On-surface
synthesis unites the promises of molecular materials and of self-assembly,
with the sturdiness of covalently bonded structures: an ideal scenario
for future applications. Following this idea, we report the synthesis
of functional extended nanowires by self-assembly. In particular,
the products correspond to one-dimensional organic semiconductors.
The uniaxial alignment provided by our substrate templates allows
us to access with exquisite detail their electronic properties, including
the full valence band dispersion, by combining local probes with spatial
averaging techniques. We show how, by selectively doping the molecular
precursors, the product’s energy level alignment can be tuned
without compromising the charge carrier’s mobility.

==== Body
Bottom-up covalent assembly is
nowadays a versatile approach to synthesize low dimensional materials.1−3 Its combination with well-defined substrates, typically termed as
“on-surface chemistry”, has achieved great progress
over the past few years.4,5 Planar multifunctional
molecular precursors with different size and shape have been used
to grow networks with modular porosity and controlled connectivity.6−9 Moreover, the use of different functional groups and different substrates
has afforded a significant increase of the degree of long-range order
through either stepwise or hierarchical approaches.10−13 However, little attention and
few experimental studies have been so far devoted to the study of
the electronic properties of such surface supported polymers by averaging
techniques.14−16 To some extent this is because many of the produced
surface-supported networks have a considerable level of structural
defectiveness on the large scale and the probed species not always
represent the majority product of the synthesis. Thus, intrinsically
local probes such as scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy
(STS) have been the primary tools for exploring these surface-confined
products.17−20 For this reason, although significant computational efforts have
been devoted to investigate the electronic properties of 1D and 2D
polymers,21,22 experiments providing full band dispersion
of such polymeric materials and thus a deeper understanding of their
electronic properties are still scarce. Such properties of the polymer/substrate
interface are, however, of outmost importance for the system’s
ultimate functionality. Their understanding and how to tune them by,
for instance, chemical modifications, is thus a requisite toward the
rational design and electronic structure engineering of functional
materials and interfaces.

Poly-para-phenylene
(PPP, see Figure 1)
is a rigid-wire π-conjugated polymer that has attracted considerable
attention. Its large band gap has been exploited to obtain blue light
emitting diodes23 and its conductivity
can be easily increased through oxidative or reductive doping.24 Additionally, the booming interest in armchair
graphene nanoribbons (A-GNR) has recently evidenced that PPP can be
considered as the simplest A-GNR with N = 3.25,26 However, direct study of the electronic properties of pristine PPP,
as well as its use in practical applications, has been hampered by
its lack of processability. Oligomers longer than six phenyl rings
are insoluble and infusible, and the material in both bulk and thin
film forms is characterized by high defectiveness.27 For these reasons until now the electronic properties
of “infinite” PPP wires have been inferred from the
properties of short, soluble (appropriately functionalized) or surface-supported
oligomers,19,28,29 rather than tested directly.

Figure 1 Molecular precursors with none (1), one (2), and two (3) pyridine
rings are reported, along with the respective products PPP, N1-PPP,
and N2-PPP.

In this work, we exploit
on-surface synthesis to obtain extended and macroscopically ordered
PPP wires and two different pyridinic derivatives. We report their
full characterization by combined local (STM, STS) and surface averaging
techniques [angle resolved photoemission (ARPES), core-level photoemission
(XPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS)
and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)], as well as by ab initio calculations based on density functional theory
(DFT). Linking theory and experimental work, we have examined the
energy-momentum dispersion of extended PPP molecular wires, and their
electronic structure dependence on nitrogen doping in specific sites
of the organic scaffold has been probed.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 summarizes
the adopted synthetic protocol and shows the chemical structure of
the building blocks. Ullmann-like surface-assisted polymerization
of brominated molecular precursors has been carried out to produce
the polymers. Some of us have recently reported a detailed study on
this synthesis protocol using 4,4″-dibromo-p-terphenyl (monomer 1 in Figure 1) on Au(111) and the structural characterization
of the final products: PPP wires and graphene nanoribbons.26

Since surface averaging momentum-resolved
measurements require the macroscopic alignment of the PPP chains,
the polymers were prepared by covalent coupling of 4,4″-dibromo-p-terphenyl (1) on clean Au(887). This surface
is vicinal to the (111) plane and shows a periodic succession of narrow
terraces (≈3.9 nm wide) with {111} plane orientation, whose
monatomic steps run along the [11̅0] direction. Because PPP
wires grow on Au(111) with their main axis parallel to the [11̅0]
direction,26 Au(887) allows one to align
the polymers to obtain a highly anisotropic sample (see Figure 2a). As a result, the LEED pattern
corresponds to a superstructure involving uniaxially aligned polymer
chains commensurate with the substrate. A well-defined interchain
spacing of ∼10 Å along the [112̅] direction is evidenced
by the LEED spots marked with blue arrows in Figure 2. This spacing supports the presence of Br
atoms in between the polymer chains, also observed by STM. Along the
chains we infer a periodicity of ∼8.4 Å (0.75 Å–1), twice the phenyl–phenyl distance, which
coincides with thrice the Au lattice parameter. An epitaxial matrix [4 2, 0 3]
is thus in excellent agreement with our LEED image. However, an unresolved
striped motif is observed due to the lack of phase relation between
the phenyl rings of adjacent chains (see Figure S1).

0.60 V, I = 0.63 nA) of aligned PPP chains on Au(887)
and comparison between experimental (V = −0.4
V, I = 1.2 nA) and DFT simulated STM images and (b)
experimental LEED pattern (E = 50 eV) of the same
surface. Model color code: C, yellow; H, white.

The experimental band structures, Eversusk, of the clean and PPP-covered
Au(887) are illustrated in Figure 3, panels a and b, respectively. From this direct comparison,
it is clear that the valence band with maximum (VBM) at E = −1.04 eV, k∥ = 1.49 Å–1 and dispersing all the way to E = −6.3 eV at Γ̅ originates from the
polymeric wires (band marked with the green arrow in Figure 3b and in Figure S2, where the ARPES second derivative is displayed).
The derived real space periodicity (4.21 Å) relates well with
the expected inter-ring spacing of ≈4.3 Å (1.46 Å–1)30 assuming, as previously
observed on para-sexyphenyl, that due to modulation
of the photoemission transition matrices the measured band maximum
corresponds to the polymer structure’s second Brillouin zone.29
In addition, three nondispersive bands at −2.7, −4.6,
and −6.22 eV are observed, marked by dotted lines in Figure 3b.

DFT calculated band structure (reported in Figure S3) performed on free-standing polymers,
as well as on Au(111)-supported PPP wires with the experimentally
found geometry, reproduces correctly the main features of experimental
ARPES, such as the curvature of the main dispersive band and the presence
of quasi flat bands at energies comparable with the experiment. Calculations
with and without the Br atoms remaining in between chains show that
the linear arrangement of Br causes none of the bands mentioned above. Figure S3 also demonstrates that the dispersive
band can be rationalized by a linear combination of benzene orbitals
with the major weight at the linking carbon atoms (i.e., atoms 1 and 4 of each ring, related to benzene’s HOMO) resulting
in a molecular orbital delocalized along the PPP wire length, whereas
the quasi-flat bands stem from localized molecular orbitals resulting
from linear combination of ring-localized benzene orbitals (i.e., atoms 2, 3, 5, and 6 of each ring, related to benzene’s
HOMO–1). Moreover it is important to remark that the energies
of the three experimentally observed nondispersive bands coincide
with the intensity maxima of the clean substrate 3d bands (see Figure 3a,b). Therefore,
the origin of these experimentally observed bands may be related to
a combination of both substrate and PPP overlayer contributions.

Differently from the case of sexyphenyl, where a discretized dispersion
has been observed,29 our on-surface polymer
shows a continuous dispersion of the band due to the overlap of a
higher number of monomer orbitals. A theoretical study of the electronic
structure dependence on the length in polyphenylene oligomers has
shown that for a molecule with 18 phenyl rings the energy difference
between successive states is so small that the situation is equivalent
to the formation of a continuous band.31 Hence, our samples (Figure 2a, Figure S4), where the typical chains greatly exceed that length (18 phenyl rings correspond
to only about 8 nm), can be regarded as a good representation of the
electronic structure of an infinitely long PPP chain.

Constant
energy maps of the clean surface and of PPP wires at the VBM (Figure 3c) reveal that its
intensity is spread almost uniformly in k⊥. That is, perpendicular to the wires (along [112̅]), the bands
show negligible energy dispersion. Such flat bands imply that these
orbitals are localized within the wires, due to a negligible intermolecular
coupling. The result therefore reflects the occurrence of a truly
one-dimensional band dispersion excluding electronic coupling between
PPP wires.

Additional weaker features are observed at lower
momentum values, see the red arrow in Figure 3d. In particular, a replica of the main dispersive
band of the polymer lies at k∥ ≈
0.75 Å–1, i.e., at half of
its Brillouin zone (π/4.2 Å). This is in excellent agreement
with the system’s periodicity as measured with LEED and may
be understood as stemming naturally from the epitaxial relationship
with the substrate (which shows commensuration at every second phenyl
ring). However, the fact that the unit cell in real space is
twice the Ph–Ph separation may also be interpreted by a twisted
conformation of the PPP chain due to the steric hindrance between
the orto hydrogen atoms of neighboring phenyl rings.32,33 Since the interaction with the substrate usually tends to flatten
the molecules (in fact PPP chains are flat on Cu(110)34 while sexyphenyl is twisted in thick films29), the twisted conformation should be confirmed by independent
means.

Polarization-dependent NEXAFS measurements have been
performed to gather insight into the adsorption geometry of the PPP
chains. The spectra were acquired by scanning the [112̅] surface
direction (perpendicular to chains) with the X-ray polarization projection.
As observed in Figure 4a, the C K-edge exhibits four peaks at 285.07 (π1*), 288.97 (π2*), 293.69 (σ1*), and a broad
peak at 301.59 eV (σ2*), in agreement with NEXAFS spectra collected
from benzene physisorbed on metal surfaces.35,36 The tilt angle of the π* orbital of the benzene ring relative
to the surface normal has been obtained by comparing the angle-dependent
intensity of the π1* resonance and the predicted resonance intensity according
to a Stöhr-derived equation for 2-fold substrate symmetry,37 see Supporting Information for details. As reported in Figure 4, the π1* resonance intensity shows an opposite polarization
dependence to that of σ1* and σ2* and it is maximized at grazing incidence,
while the nonvanishing intensity at normal incidence implies a nonplanar
geometry: the derived orientation of the benzene ring planes relative
to the surface is α = 20° ± 5° (see Figure S5). Therefore, NEXAFS linear dichroism
confirms that the PPP chains adopt a twisted conformation wherein
adjacent phenyl rings are alternately rotated clockwise and counterclockwise
with respect to the PPP main axis. The full twist angle of 40°
± 10° is of the order of that predicted for PPP in the gas
phase33 and emphasizes the weak influence
of the substrate that, for stronger molecule–substrate interactions,
would tend to flatten the polymer structure. The observed replica
in the ARPES spectrum may thus be related both to a twisted conformation
of the polymer and to the commensuration with the substrate, since
both effects are observed at the same time.

The spectra were collected with the polarization in the plane defined
by the surface normal and the [112̅] direction (perpendicular
to the chains) and Θ is defined as the angle between the polarization
and the surface normal (see Figure S5).

behavior for different tilt angles of the phenyl rings. The calculated
curves have been normalized to the first experimental value at θ
= 30° for better comparison.

Interestingly, the formation of this ordered adlayer leads
to the observation of an intense replica of the gold sp band at 1.13
Å–1, see the blue arrow in Figure 3d. Indeed, the adlayer introduces
a new set of reciprocal lattice vectors , whose
reciprocal length is 0.75 Å–1 for the twisted
PPP, which can lead to a back-folding of surface emission by a surface
Umklapp process. Since the parallel component of the electron momentum
is conserved in the photoemission process, inclusion of this new  gives rise, in the present
case, to the observed band in the direction containing  +  (1.13
+ 0.75 Å–1 and folded back at ≈1.1 Å–1, since the K̅ point of gold
is in the proximity of 1.49 Å–1).38,39 The presence of this Umklapp process, along with the disappearance
of the surface state, hints to a significant hybridization between
PPP and Au, which has been confirmed with DFT calculations (see Figure S3). Nevertheless, the hybridization is
still modest enough to allow for the observation of the full PPP band
dispersion throughout the Au 3d band energies, down to −6.3
eV.

The effect of nitrogen incorporation into the conjugated
PPP chain has been investigated by two pyridinic derivatives of 4,4″-dibromo-p-terphenyl, see monomers 2 and 3 in Figure 1. By means
of these molecules, the changes in the electronic and transport properties
can be mapped as a function of gradually increased nitrogen content.
Again, with the use of the 1D templating effect of the Au(887) vicinal
surface, the targeted linear products have been obtained with a massive
yield. STM imaging reveals well-oriented wires parallel to the steps
direction and organized according to the same commensurate epitaxial
matrix [4 2, 0 3] of the undoped PPP chains. In fact, the pyridinic derivatives
are characterized by the same distance and dihedral angle between
neighboring rings (Figure S6). Even if
these PPP derivatives are isostructural with the undoped PPP, a closer
inspection reveals an intramolecular modulation of the probed density
of states with the same periodicity of the pyridinic functionalization
as visible in the small-scale STM images in Figure 5a,b.

STM images of a single chain is reported as lateral inset for the
different polymers. (a) 20 × 20 nm2, V = −0.40 V, I = 0.51 nA; inset) V = −0.5 V, I = 2.0 nA; (b) 20 × 20 nm2, V = −0.71 V, I =
2.6 nA; inset) V = −0.5 V, I = 1.50 nA. Model color code: C, yellow; N, blue; H, white.

DFT simulated STM images reported
in Figure 5 correctly
reproduce this behavior, where the pyridine rings appear smaller than
phenyl rings, due to the lack of peripheral H atoms and to the lower
N-related partial density of states near the Fermi energy (as reported
below in Figure 6).
Further evidence for the chemical environment of the nitrogen atoms
comes from core-level photoemission (see Supporting Information for the complete XPS characterization of N 1s,
C 1s, Br 3d core levels). Moving to ARPES, the electronic structure
probed on nitrogen-containing polymers share the main characteristics
of PPP. In fact, the double periodicity and the Umklapp process are
clearly visible both for N1-PPP and N2-PPP. However, the VBMs
exhibit a dependence on the degree of nitrogen substitution. The VBM
for pristine PPP is EF −1.04
eV and decreases in N1-PPP to EF −1.26
eV and to EF −1.38 eV in N2-PPP
(see Figure 6a). Hence,
we observe a continuous downshift of the VBM as the nitrogen content
increases by as much as ≈0.35 eV for the doubly substituted
PPP derivative. Since the conduction band remains above the Fermi
level even in the doped wires, no information can be obtained about
the magnitude of the band gap from these ARPES measurements, except
that it should be larger than 1.4 ± 0.1 eV.

polymers at k∥ close to the VBM.
The superimposed red-dashed lines are the parabolic fit of the band

on PPP and N2-PPP, black and blue spectra, respectively; (c) computed
projected densities of states (PDOS) of the different polymers. Total
and pz projected density of states are
compared for PPP, and nitrogen-related pz is additionally disclosed for N2-PPP to underline the negligible
contribution of N to valence and conduction bands.

Direct measurement of the band gaps has been performed
by STS (dI/dV) along the polymer
chains with highest (N2-PPP) and no doping (PPP), see Figure 6b. In the experimental bias range of −1.8 to +2.3 V, PPP clearly
shows two band onsets around −1.3 and +2.0 V, whereas the bands
of the nitrogen-containing polymer N2-PPP rigidly shift toward lower
bias voltages, at about −1.6 and +1.7 V, respectively. This implies a similar
band gap (peak-to-peak) of Eg = 3.3 ±
0.2 eV for both PPP and N2-PPP. This value is in good agreement with
the band gap reported for PPP on Cu(111) (3.1 ± 0.2 eV),19 albeit in stark contrast with that reported
for PPP on Cu(110) (1.15 eV), where a massive band gap renormalization
occurs due to a strong hybridization with the substrate.40

While STS and ARPES measurements reveal
similar shifts upon N-doping, the onset of the valence band appears
at about 0.25 eV higher binding energies in STS than in ARPES, probably
related to the difference in the measured systems: STS was performed
on single PPP chains on Au(111), while ARPES measurements were taken
from compact PPP layers on Au(788). These differences in the systems
may result in the observed shift by two possible mechanisms: (i) a
difference in work function. Indeed, we measure a 0.27 eV lower work
function on Au(111) as compared to Au(788) (see Figure S12). Besides, since single chains are not flanked
by Br atoms, changes in the local work function due to the absence
of Br may add up to that difference.41 And
because a lower work function generally brings about higher binding
energies (although not necessarily by the same amount42), this could explain our observations. (ii) A lack of screening
from neighboring PPP chains or Br atoms during STS characterization
may also result in higher binding energies and thereby contribute
to the observed differences.43,44

Most importantly,
our STS characterization shows that the downward shift of the valence
band upon nitrogen incorporation is not related to a modified band
gap, but to a shift of the whole band structure. This is further corroborated
with the indirect evidence of a lower energy conduction band (CB)
for N-doped polymers by the shifting onset of the NEXAFS resonances
(Figure S10), as well as with DFT calculations.
The calculated projected densities of states (PDOS) of the different
polymers are shown in Figure 6c. Apart from the offset of the conduction band and the absolute
value of Eg, the DFT PDOS are qualitatively
in agreement with our observations, since both the VB and the CB onsets
shift rigidly toward lower bias voltage, leaving the band gap nearly
unchanged. This effect is in agreement with the generally accepted
picture of decreased electron density on the pyridine ring due to the electronegative nitrogen. Hence, the ionization potential
and the electron affinity systematically increase, while the band
gap is nearly unaffected, as observed for solid films of PPP (2.93
eV) and poly-pyridine (2.82–2.95 eV).45,46 Within this picture it is also reasonable to assume that the shift
is not strictly linear with N content, since the first N atom takes
charge from a pure hydrocarbon molecule/polymer, while subsequent
N atoms must take charge from an already charge-depleted carbon backbone
of the molecules/polymers. This is indeed our observation, since going
from PPP to N1-PPP, ARPES reveals a valence band downward shift of
0.22 eV, while adding one more N atom from N1-PPP to N2-PPP results
in a lower shift of only 0.12 eV (0.34 eV with respect to the undoped
PPP).47

Closely related studies on
the effect of nitrogen doping have been performed on 6,11-dibromo-1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-triphenylene
precursors that afford chevron graphene nanoribbons after thermal
activation.15,48 One of these studies compared
precursors with none, one and two incorporated N atoms, that is, with
fractions of nitrogen heteroatoms within the doped precursors of 2.4%
and 4.8%, respectively. The associated valence band shifts with respect
to the undoped structure were 0.14 eV (2.4% heteroatoms) and 0.23
eV (4.8% heteroatoms). The other study compared precursors with none
and four N atoms, revealing band shifts of 0.5 eV (9.5% heteroatoms).
The valence band shift and fraction of nitrogen heteroatoms of the
precursors used in this work correspond to 0.22 eV (5.6%, N1-PPP)
and 0.34 eV (11.1%, N2-PPP), thus falling within a fully comparable
range with respect to previous reports (Figure S13).

However, as opposed to previous works, we additionally
provide insight into transport properties, gathered in terms of the
effective mass (m*) of holes in the valence band
and derived from the curvature of the energy band. From a parabolic
fit of the top of the valence band, we determined m* = −0.19 me for PPP, a value in agreement with
DFT calculations on an infinitely long, unsupported PPP wire (−0.17
me) (see Figure S3) and in line
with the high carrier mobility in PPP oligomers.26 For direct comparison, the same analysis was done on N1-PPP
and N2-PPP, revealing a negligible effect of the pyridine ring, since
both of them have m* = −0.19 me. As indicated by the comparison of N2-PPP total pz and N-related pz projected DOS
reported in Figure 6c, the highest-lying valence bands are mainly composed by carbon
π density, which amounts to saying that the heteroatom contributes
little to define the hole carrier mobility in the valence band.46,49

Conclusions
In summary, we have grown three different extended
one-dimensional polymers in a bottom-up fashion, namely poly-para-phenylene and two pyridinic derivatives, with selected
and gradually increasing nitrogen content. To characterize their band
structure, macroscopically anisotropic samples have been prepared
taking advantage of vicinal surface templating. Using angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal a fully dispersive one-dimensional
behavior of these semiconducting organic wires and we prove that the electronic
structure can be monotonically downshifted relative to the metal Fermi
level as the pyridine substitution is increased within the molecular
scaffold. Although the nitrogen insertion modulates the valence band
onset by as much as 0.34 eV for the doubly doped monomer, DFT calculations
in combination with scanning tunneling spectroscopy show that the
band gap is unaffected (Eg = 3.3 ±
0.2 eV). Furthermore, from a parabolic fit of the ARPES data at the
top of the valence band, a similar effective mass of 0.19 me is evidenced for all polymers, implying comparable charge carrier
mobility irrespective of the degree of nitrogen doping. This work
thus confirms the possibility to tailor the electronic properties
of functional organic nanowires, in particular the energy level alignment
with respect to the Fermi level, without compromising the product’s
transport response (in terms of carrier mobilities) by selectively
doping the molecular precursors. Finally, our findings represent a
benchmark for the controlled growth of organic monolayers and the
characterization of their electronic properties for future technological
applications.

Methods
The
Au(887) substrate surface was prepared by standard sputtering-annealing
cycles. Subsequently, the samples were prepared by thermal evaporation
of the precursors at 105, 100, and 90 °C for precursors 1, 2 and 3, respectively, onto
the substrate kept at room temperature. Multilayer deposition was
followed by thermal annealing to 180 °C for 20 min, which brought
about multilayer desorption and polymerization of the molecules at
the interface with the metal. The samples thus obtained consisted
of compact monolayers of polymers aligned along the substrate steps.
STM and angle resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
were measured in a UHV system combining a commercial Omicron VT-STM
and a home-built chamber equipped for ARPES with a closed-circuit
He-compressor-cooled manipulator, a monochromatized gas discharge
lamp and a SPECS Phoibos 150 electron analyzer. Being interconnected,
STM and ARPES measurements were performed sequentially on the same
sample without breaking the UHV conditions at any time. ARPES measurements
were performed at a sample temperature of 90 K using the He I line
(21.2 eV). The work function was determined from the low energy cutoff and Fermi edge in the photoemission spectra, measured on a sample
polarized with 10 V. STS measurements were performed in a separated,
commercial low-temperature STM operated at LN2 temperature.
Differently from the samples for ARPES, the polymer chains were grown
at submonolayer coverage on a Au(111) surface. An electrochemically
etched W tip was used for topographic and spectroscopic measurements.
The spectroscopic dI/dV measurements
were recorded by a lock-in amplifier modulating the sample bias with
a sinusoidal voltage of 20 mV amplitude under open-feedback conditions.
WSxM software was used to process all STM images.50

NEXAFS and XPS measurements were performed at the
D1011 beamline at the MAX-IV laboratory (Lund, Sweden). The C K-edge
NEXAFS spectra were measured in partial electron yield (PEY) mode.
A retarding potential, Uret, of −150
V was applied to the PEY detector in order to increase the signal-to-background
ratio. The NEXAFS spectra were normalized to the spectra from the
corresponding clean metal surfaces and to the continuum jump. The
photoelectron spectra were measured relative to the Au 4f7/2 core level (BE = 84.00 eV) and were taken in a normal emission geometry.
Fitting of the C 1s and Br 3d PE spectra was performed with the XPS
peak software. The C 1s core level spectrum has been deconvoluted
by assuming the presence of two different inequivalent carbon atoms
within the molecular structure, i.e., carbon-bonded
carbon, C–C, and nitrogen-bonded carbon, C–N and by
keeping the ratio between the areas constant according to the theoretical
stoichiometric ratios. The kinetic energy resolution of the SES-200
electron analyzer was set to 125 meV for the core-level spectra.

We simulated PPP, N1-PPP and N2-PPP finite wires ∼8 nm long
(18 rings), adsorbed on a Au(111) substrate, by means of Density Functional
Theory in the mixed Gaussian plane waves framework, as implemented
in the CP2K code.51 We used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) parametrization of the exchange–correlation functional.52 Dispersion corrections were included following
the recipe of Grimme and with a parametrization according to Ruiz.53,54 The Au(111) substrate was modeled within the repeated slab geometry55 using orthorhombic simulation cells containing
four layers of gold and one layer of hydrogen atoms to suppress the
surface state of Au(111) on one side of the slab. The surface of the
slab corresponded to 240 unit cells (4 × 30 rectangular units,
with extension ≈21 × 90 Å2), and more
than 20 Å of vacuum was included. The atomic coordinates of the
topmost two Au(111) layers and the adsorbed molecular species were
fully optimized until forces on atoms were lower that 10–4 au. STM simulations were performed in the Tersoff–Hamann
approximation56 in constant-current mode
using the toolkit asetk.57 To overcome
limitations of localized basis sets for nonperiodic systems, the electronic
states were extrapolated into the vacuum region.58 Since the tip shape and the tip–sample distance
were not accessible experimentally, a quantitative simulation of the
experimental tunneling current was not attempted here. We chose the
charge–density isovalue to provide a realistic tip–sample
distance on the order of 5 Å. The PDOS presented in Figure 6 are computed for
wires in the gas phase constrained to the equilibrium adsorption geometry
obtained from the calculations. A large simulation cell including
the three ribbons together allowed us to avoid any problem of energy
alignment.

Also the work function
of the polymer-covered Au(887) shows a monotonic reduction by ≈90
meV for each added N atom (φN0-PPP = 5.10 eV, φN1-PPP = 5.02 eV, φN2-PPP = 4.93 eV, see Figure S12). However, this effect is smaller
in magnitude than the observed shifts in the bands and thus cannot
account for the latter phenomenon, for example by vacuum level alignment.
