Complex hierarchical architectures
are ubiquitous in nature. By
designing and controlling the interaction between elementary building
blocks, nature is able to optimize a large variety of materials with
multiple functionalities. Such control is, however, extremely challenging
in man-made materials, due to the difficulties in controlling their
interaction at different length scales simultaneously. Here, hierarchical
cholesteric architectures are obtained by the self-assembly of cellulose
nanocrystals within shrinking, micron-sized aqueous droplets. This
confined, spherical geometry drastically affects the colloidal self-assembly
process, resulting in concentric ordering within the droplet, as confirmed
by simulation. This provides a quantitative tool to study the interactions
of cellulose nanocrystals beyond what has been achieved in a planar
geometry. Our developed methodology allows us to fabricate truly hierarchical
solid-state architectures from the nanometer to the macroscopic scale
using a renewable and sustainable biopolymer.

Designing
and controlling the
interaction of elementary building blocks into complex hierarchical
architectures enables nature to optimize a large variety of materials
with multiple functionalities.1−3 Within the fascinating variety
of designs and materials, helicoidal architectures are a recurring
motif in nature,4−8 yet little is known about the natural assembly process.9 Consequently, the ability to fabricate biomimetic
replicas is fundamentally important not only to elucidate the design
principles that underlie the evolution of complex hierarchical structures
in nature but also to inspire the development of materials where their
functionalities are encoded in the building blocks that compose them.10−12 However, control across a diversity of length scales ranging from
nanometers to several hundreds of microns is extremely challenging
in man-made materials.13

Here, inspired
by the helicoidal architectures found in the plant
cell wall,14 we study the assembly of cholesteric
architectures of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) confined within monodisperse
micron-sized droplets, generated via droplet-based
microfluidics.15,16 The self-assembly process is
monitored with polarized optical microscopy, and the effect of the
initial aqueous CNC concentration on the resultant self-assembled
architecture is studied. This system not only allows for the localized,
quantitative investigation of the complex dynamic interaction of CNCs
in suspension but also offers a pathway to obtain highly hierarchical
structures in a confined geometry from the nanometer to the macroscopic
scale, using a renewable and sustainable polymer.

Exploitation
of cellulose has existed since the beginning of civilization,
from clothes and paper to use as a construction material,17 yet over the last two decades, it has attracted
a growing interest due to its abundance and versatility when processed
on the nanoscale in the form of cellulose nanocrystals.18 By strong acid hydrolysis, CNC can be extracted
from a variety of natural sources, producing stable aqueous suspensions
that exhibit cholesteric liquid-crystalline behavior at higher concentrations.19 The evaporation of CNC suspensions on a flat
substrate can result in the formation of a solid film with a periodic
chiral structure that can reflect visible light.20 Traditionally, the self-assembly of such colloidal liquid-crystal
systems has been studied in planar geometries,21−23 offering a
large variety of applications, for example, in pressure or temperature
sensors.24,25 However, more recently, there has been increasing
study into the effects of topological constraints.26 Of particular interest is the spherical geometry, where
the curvature imposed, for example, by the interface of an emulsified
droplet leads to frustrated liquid-crystalline self-organization.27 This spherical topology, either as a droplet
or as a thin shell of liquid, has been shown to give rise to peculiar
phenomena, with potential applications in actuators or lasers.16,28,29

The study of the self-assembly
of CNCs in a microdroplet enables
(i) the reproducible measurement of the cholesteric pitch at concentrations
that are inaccessible with traditional pitch diagrams due to kinetic
arrest, and (ii) monitoring of the self-assembly process over a few
hours, instead of several days or weeks,30 thereby reducing errors induced by desulfation of the CNC.31

Results and Discussion
An aqueous
suspension of cellulose nanocrystals (Figure S1, Supporting Information) was prepared as described
in the Experimental Methods. To characterize
the lyotropic properties of this suspension, it was diluted to give
a series of CNC concentrations from 14.5 to 4.7 wt %, and the proportion
of anisotropic phase was evaluated at each concentration (Figure 1a). This enabled
the construction of a traditional phase diagram, as shown in Figure 1b. This phase diagram
allows for determination of the critical values of CNC concentration
for this specific suspension at which the transition from the isotropic
to the anisotropic phase occurs.

as imaged under cross-polarizers, where a clear transition from pure
isotropic to anisotropic phase is observed from left to right. (b)
Calculated ratio of anisotropic phase present for each concentration
investigated in (a) was used to compile the phase diagram (crosses).
The specific concentrations investigated within microdroplets are

generation of microfluidic
water-in-oil droplets from a 14.5 wt % suspension of CNCs, as imaged
under cross-polarizers (right) and with a first-order tint plate (left),
illustrating the initial radial assembly.

In order to understand the impact of geometrical confinement,
it
was necessary to study how the initial concentration of the CNC suspension
affected self-assembly within a micron-scale droplet. Microdroplets
were generated in a single step as an aqueous emulsion in hexadecane
oil within a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flow-focusing microfluidic
device, as described in the Experimental Methods. At the flow-focusing junction, the aqueous CNC suspension intersected
perpendicularly with flows of hexadecane oil, resulting in segmentation
into monodisperse microdroplets (coefficient of variation <2%),
with a diameter defined by the geometry of the flow focus, and the
relative flow rates and viscosities of the immiscible solutions. Once
formed, the droplets were collected via microbore
tubing onto a fluorophilic substrate for further study. It should
be noted that the aqueous droplets are denser than the surrounding
oil and, as such, settle onto the surface of the fluorophilic substrate
rather than at the air–oil interface (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The presence of this
oil layer slows the loss of water from the droplets, allowing them
to be studied over time scales from hours to days.

Microdroplets
with a typical diameter of 140 μm were prepared
from a series of CNC concentrations across the phase transition, as
indicated by the colored circles in Figure 1b. In all cases, the optical anisotropy of
the suspension allowed for the ordering of CNC domains to be visualized
during droplet formation by polarized optical microscopy, as described
in the Experimental Methods. This is exemplified
with a 14.5 wt % CNC suspension, as denoted by the red circle in the
phase diagram (Figure 1b). Here, the generation of an interface between the two fluids at
the neck of the flow focus resulted in an immediate radial ordering
of the CNCs within the microdroplet, giving rise to a pronounced Maltese
cross-like pattern when imaged under crossed polarizers (Figure 1c; see Video S1 and Video S2). However, this arrangement is rapidly disrupted by chaotic advection
induced within the microdroplet by shearing interactions with its
surroundings as it travels along the microfluidic channel. At such
a high concentration, the suspension is highly viscous and is almost
entirely in a liquid-crystalline phase. For this reason, the shear
experienced by the cholesteric phase inside the droplet induces many
topological defects. This droplet consequentially remains trapped
in this disordered anisotropic state without any particular reordering
of the structure. Upon subsequent removal of water (by diffusion into
the oil) and corresponding concentration of the confined suspension,
this arrangement is preserved (Figure S3, Supporting Information). A similar trend is observed for a lower concentration
of 10.9 wt % (blue circle on Figure 1b). Here, despite microdroplets containing both isotropic
and anisotropic phases, the relaxation toward a radial geometry was
again not significantly observed after initial droplet formation (Figure
S4, Supporting Information).

A markedly
different assembly process is observed when the isotropic
phase is dominant within the microdroplet, as is the case for 7.3
wt % suspension of CNCs (green circle in Figure 1b). As before, radial ordering of the liquid-crystalline
structure is observed upon generation of the microfluidic droplets;
however, mixing within the droplet as it flows along the channel results
in microdroplets in a predominantly isotropic phase, containing clearly
defined tactoids (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Upon the loss of water from the droplet the tactoids rearrange,
resulting in the formation of an ordered chiral nematic shell, growing
inward from the water–oil interface (Figure 2). Depending on the number and dimensions
of the tactoids (which is influenced by the individual composition
of each microdroplet), either a chiral nematic shell containing free
tactoids or a radial order throughout the entire diameter of the droplet
is obtained (Figure S6, Supporting Information). In the latter case, such ordering can be preserved until the onset
of buckling during the final stages of water loss from the droplet
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). We
attribute buckling to the interplay between increasing Laplace pressure
at lower radius of curvature and the resistance to isotropic compression
of the solidified CNC shell of the microdroplet, which allows for
loss of the remaining water content without laterally compressing
the rigidified surface. The presence of the chiral nematic organization
throughout the entire diameter of the droplet is confirmed by the
numerically simulated pattern shown in Figure 2a (see Supporting Information for simulation details). In particular, the observation of concentric
dark and bright circles corresponds to the fingerprint pattern of
the cholesteric structure. The superimposed Maltese cross pattern
is due to the isoclines of the radial cholesteric helix axis aligned
with the axes of the crossed polarizers, in agreement with a planar
anchoring of the CNC local director with the droplet interface.

Figure 2 Comparison
between (a) theoretical and (b) experimental images
obtained from the confinement of a cholesteric CNC suspension within
a spherical geometry, when viewed through cross-polarizers (top row)
and upon addition of a first-order tint plate (bottom row). Upon loss
of water, the Maltese cross is retained until the onset of buckling
upon final drying.

Low viscosity and a homogeneous
composition are expected to increase
the proportion of droplets retaining the radial chiral nematic order,
with the in situ formation of a chiral nematic phase
expected to reduce the generation of shear-induced topological defects.
This was confirmed with droplets solely containing an isotropic suspension
of CNC (5.8 wt %, purple circle in Figure 1b), where the formation of independent tactoids
within the volume of the droplet was no longer observed upon droplet
shrinkage, with the isotropic–anisotropic phase transition
instead initiated exclusively at the water–oil interface (Figure
S8, Supporting Information). Furthermore,
lower concentrations have been tested. However, for values lower than
4 wt %, the loss of water in ambient conditions leads only to a thin
shell with transient cholesteric order. This shell is subsequently
disrupted by buckling32 prior to the droplet
core becoming sufficiently concentrated.

The observation of
the microdroplet shrinkage process by polarized
optical microscopy allowed for monitoring of the pitch evolution as
a function of the water content. This particular configuration enables
the construction of an “evolution pitch diagram” which
depicts the behavior of the cholesteric phase from low concentration
at the equilibrium toward the final dry state. The pitch (p) is measured as twice the periodicity of the fingerprint
pattern observed between crossed polarizers, while the suspension
concentration is calculated from the droplet diameter. Variation in
the pitch measured across a single droplet was within experimental
error, indicating that the CNC concentration was uniform throughout
the shrinking droplet. Similarly, droplets with comparable CNC concentration
displayed the same cholesteric pitch. The values of the pitch measured
during the loss of water from the microdroplets are reported in Figure 3 and compared to
the values of the pitch independently obtained from measurement in
a glass capillary (see Experimental Methods). It is worth noting here that, for a given initial value of CNC
concentration, the same trend in pitch is measured irrespective of
the dimensions of the initial droplets (Figure S9, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 (a) Evolution pitch diagram. The cholesteric
pitch measured in
the droplets (blue circles) is compared against a macroscale capillary
measured by laser diffraction (red circles) and microscopy (red triangles).
The pitch below 2 μm was not measured due to the optical resolution
limit. Upon increasing CNC concentration, the measured cholesteric
pitch in the droplets is initially consistent with the pitch measured
in the capillary; however, for the case of confined suspensions, a
transition at cg = 12% v/v (∼19
wt %) is observed. Extrapolation of the c–1 and c–1/3 trend lines correlates
with the pitch measured by scanning electron microscopy for a dry
film and microparticle, respectively (diamonds). The capillary error
bars correspond to the gradient in pitch observed as a function of
position within the anisotropic phase, as shown in Figure S16, Supporting Information. (b) Schematics illustrating
the effect on the helicoidal cholesteric structure upon three-dimensional
contraction when confined within a sphere, as occurs after cg (p ∝ c–1/3, top), compared to unidirectional contraction
in a planar geometry (p ∝ c–1, bottom).

The essence of the self-assembly process of CNC in suspension
is
illustrated by Figure 3. At a low concentration of CNC in suspension, the cholesteric pitch
observed both in the droplets and in the capillaries overlaps and
appears to be inversely proportional to concentration, p ∝ c–1, as expected from
Straley modeling of chiral nonflexible rods.33 The small discrepancy between the two pitch measurements above 9.7
wt % is attributed to the cholesteric monodomain within the droplets,
as commented upon in the Supporting Information. In contrast, droplets prepared from [CNC] = 10.9 wt % remain trapped
in a polydomain structure and, as such, more closely follow the capillary
data (Figure S10).

Significantly,
above a critical concentration denoted here as cg, a transition after which the pitch scales
as p ∝ c–1/3 is observed. This transition is attributed to the manifestation
of the kinetic arrest, where the sample cannot relax. Indeed, such
kinetic arrest is expected to take place at some point during shrinkage
toward a fully dried sphere of self-assembled CNCs. The value of cg for this specific suspension (12% v/v ≈
19 wt % in Figure 3) was found to be comparable between individual radially ordered
cholesteric droplets, irrespective of the initial size, CNC concentration,
or rate of water removal. The concentration at which this transition
occurs has been discussed and addressed in the literature as a key
factor in the understanding of the self-assembly of CNCs but remains
challenging to assess.34 As the suspension
gets kinetically trapped, the cholesteric structure cannot relax over
time, but it still can be affected by the local shear experienced
upon drying, and therefore, it is sensitive to any geometrical constraints.
In this system, the spherical geometry leads to a three-dimensional
contraction of the cholesteric structure, in agreement with the observed
power law. This contrasts with the usual configuration where a film
is cast onto a planar substrate, which leads to a unidirectional,
vertical straining of the cholesteric structure and consequentially
to a similar power law of p ∝ c–1. For this reason, the spherical geometry allows
for a clear discrimination of the transition upon kinetic arrest.

Finally, Figure 4 shows
the morphology of CNC microparticles after the complete loss
of water. For this experiment, smaller microdroplets (50 μm
in diameter) are employed to minimize the effects of buckling on the
particle structure.35 Similarly, to the
case of planar CNC films,20 the chiral
nematic nature can be maintained, evidenced by the clear helicoidal
structure observed in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
reported in Figure 4d. Moreover, the value of the pitch measured directly from such images,
closely matches the extrapolated confined pitch for a CNC concentration
near 100%, as indicated by the dashed blue line in Figure 3. In contrast, casting a planar
film via slow evaporation using the same suspension
(Figure S11, Supporting Information) results
in a cholesteric pitch consistent with the standard power law behavior
(dashed red line).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated bioinspired
hierarchical cellulose
structures over multiple length scales by controlling the self-assembly
process of cellulose nanocrystals in micron-sized droplets. The obtained
droplets are sufficiently monodisperse to allow for local study of
the self-assembly of the CNC water suspension. It is further demonstrated
that this geometrical confinement leads to a drastic effect on the
self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals. This allows for the construction
of an “evolution pitch diagram” that provides a tool
to investigate the suspension behavior for a large range of concentrations.
To our knowledge, this has not been reported so far, due to the fact
that kinetic arrest usually leads to unreliable pitch values for high
concentration.30

Experimental
Methods
Materials
Hexadecane (99%) and Span 80 were purchase
from Sigma-Aldrich and Fluka, respectively, and were used without
further purification. The initial suspension of 14.5 wt % cellulose
nanocrystals was prepared from filter paper, as described below, with
subsequent formulations diluted with deionized water (Millipore Milli-Q
gradient A10, resistivity >18 MΩ·cm–1).

Instrumentation
Microdroplets were imaged in transmission
using a Vision Research Phantom Miro ex4-M fast camera, attached to
an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope (10–64× objectives).
Polarized optical microscopy was performed in transmission with crossed
polarizers. In order to indicate CNC orientation, a sensitive tint
plate (Olympus U-TP530) was additionally inserted between the crossed
polarizers. SEM images were acquired using a Zeiss Leo Gemini 1530VP
system, working at 90° with respect to the electron beam. SEM
samples were mounted on aluminum stubs using conductive carbon tape
and, to minimize surface charging, sputtered with a 5–10 nm
layer of Au/Pd (Emitech K550; I = 55 mA for 10 s).
The acceleration voltage used was 2.0 kV, and the working distance
was 1–2 mm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired
with an Agilent 5500, collected in tapping mode (OTESPA-R3 tip) and
at room temperature over a 25 μm2 area. AFM samples
were prepared by drop-casting 10 μL of a diluted CNC suspension
on to poly(l-lysine)-functionalized mica. After deposition,
the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried under nitrogen
flow.

Cellulose Nanocrystal Suspension
Cellulose nanocrystals
were obtained from the hydrolysis of Whatman No. 1 cellulose filter
paper (30 g) with sulfuric acid (64 wt %, 420 mL) at 64 °C for
30 min, before being quenched using Milli-Q ice and water. Soluble
cellulose residues and acid were removed by centrifugation (three
steps at 20 000g for 20 min) and dialysis
against deionized water (MWCO 12–14 kDa membrane), and a stable
suspension of [CNC] = 2.2 wt % was obtained. Conductivity titration
against sodium hydroxide indicated [SO42–] = 205 mmol·kg–1 of CNC.36 The suspension was tip-sonicated in an ice bath (Fisherbrand
Ultrasonic disintegrator 500 W, amplitude 30% max 8200 J·g–1 of CNC) and vacuum-filtered (8.0 μm then 0.8
μm nitrocellulose, Sigma-Aldrich).

The suspension was
concentrated by heating at 60 °C in a water bath for 12 h, resulting
in a 14.5 wt % (∼9.4% v/v) suspension of CNC. The ionic content
of this concentrated suspension was deduced from conductometric titration
against sodium hydroxide, complemented by pH measurements before and
after potassium chloride addition, and corresponds to the following:
36% surface charge loss by CNC partial desulfation ([SO42–] = 131 mmol·kg–1 of CNC)
[CNC–] = 19 mM, the release of [SO42–]free = 10.7 mM, [H+]free = 18.7 mM and [H+]total = 40.4 mM. Planar
films of CNC were prepared by casting 1.0 mL of a 2.0 wt % CNC suspension
in a 3.5 cm diameter polystyrene petri dish, before being allowed
to evaporate under ambient conditions.

Phase Diagram and Pitch
Measurement in Capillaries
The initial 14.5 wt % CNC suspension
was diluted with deionized water
using a high precision scale, vortexed, and transferred to a flat
capillary of sufficiently large inner dimensions to eliminate any
confinement effects (1.00 × 10.00 × 50 mm) and sealed with
glass plates and nail polish. The self-assembly was observed after
4 days and later after 95 days with no noticeable change of the critical
concentrations (Figure S12). The cholesteric
pitch in the glass capillaries was then determined using (i) polarized
optical microscopy (TPlan Nikon, 20× (NA = 0.30, WD = 30 mm)
and 50× (NA = 0.40, WD = 22 mm) objectives, Figure S13, Supporting Information); the pitch was measured
as twice the period of the fingerprint pattern, taking either an average
over 10 pitch distances or using a fast Fourier transform of the image
processed with ImageJ; (ii) laser diffraction performed using a laser
(λ = 531.8 nm) and observing the diffraction pattern in transmission
(as exemplified in Figures S14 and S15, Supporting Information). The pitch was derived using Bragg’s law,
as adapted by Kahn to include Snell law correction.37 In order to account for possible sample inhomogeneity in
the vertical dimension, the pitch was measured at regular intervals
throughout the anisotropic phase and is reported in Figure S16 in
the Supporting Information.

Droplet-Based
Microfluidics
Monodisperse water-in-oil
microdroplets were generated within a hydrophobic flow-focusing microfluidic
device. These were manufactured from PDMS via soft
lithography, whereby the microchannel network was (i) designed in silico (AutoCAD), (ii) printed as a negative photomask,
and (iii) transferred onto a silicon wafer spin-coated with SU-8 photoresist via UV-photolithography to form a mold. PDMS and the cross-linker
(Sylgard 184 elastomer kit, Dow Corning) in a 10:1 ratio were poured
onto this mold and allowed to stand overnight at 70 °C. The PDMS
layer, imprinted with the microfluidic channel design, was removed,
and using a biopsy punch (1.0 mm), inlets and an outlet were formed.
The imprinted PDMS and a glass substrate were exposed to oxygen plasma
for 8 s and then pressed together to seal the microfluidic channels.

To study the self-assembly of the CNC suspension within the microdroplet,
a 200 μm wide flow-focusing junction (A) was employed with a
channel depth of 80 μm. For structural analysis of solid microparticles
a smaller flow-focusing junction (43 × 43 μm, B) was employed
to generate the templating microdroplets. To render the channels fluorophilic,
they were immediately flushed with a 0.5% v/v solution of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane in Fluorinert FC-40 (3M) and subsequently
cured at 120 °C overnight. This hydrophobic surface modification
was also applied to glass slides that were used in “shrinking
droplet” studies, ensuring low wetting of the surface by the
aqueous microdroplets.

To generate microdroplets, the continuous
oil phase and the discrete
aqueous phase were injected into the microfluidic device via two syringe pumps (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus) with controlled
flow rates of 200 and 80 μL·h–1, respectively.
At the intersection, the shear forces caused the formation of aqueous
droplets in oil (typically for a 7.3 wt % CNC suspension: ØA = 139.5 ± 2.5 μm and ØB = 50.1
± 0.6 μm; Figure S17, Supporting Information). The continuous phase comprised the organic oil, hexadecane, with
2.0 wt % Span 80 surfactant. The dispersed phase consisted of an aqueous
suspension of cellulose nanocrystals; this was diluted as appropriate
with deionized water from an initial 14.5 wt % CNC suspension and
vortexed to homogenize the sample prior to injection into the microfluidic
device. Once the microemulsion was generated, it exited the microfluidic
device through microbore polythene tubing (ØI = 380
μm, l ≈ 10 cm) and was collected onto
a microscope slide.

The aqueous phase was allowed to slowly
diffuse into the oil at
RTP until solid microparticles were formed. During droplet shrinkage,
a linear decrease in the droplet diameter was observed (Figure S18, Supporting Information). This was typically in
the range of 10–20 μm·h–1 for
the large droplets (ØA) and increased to 25 μm·h–1 for the smaller droplets (ØB) reported
in Figure 4 (see Supporting Information).

Microparticle Analysis
Residual surfactant was removed
from the dry microparticles by washing with n-hexane
prior to imaging by SEM. To image the interior of a droplet, it was
fractured using the following protocol: the particles (on a substrate)
were first placed in a nitrogen atmosphere, cooled in liquid nitrogen,
and finally mechanically crushed. The low temperature made the droplets
more brittle, while the low humidity inhibited condensation of water.
