High
yield (>85%) and low-energy deconstruction of never-dried
residual marine biomass is proposed following partial deacetylation
and microfluidization. This process results in chitin nanofibrils
(nanochitin, NCh) of ultrahigh axial size (aspect ratios of up to
500), one of the largest for bioderived nanomaterials. The nanochitins
are colloidally stable in water (ζ-potential = +95 mV) and produce
highly entangled networks upon pH shift. Viscoelastic and strong hydrogels
are formed by ice templating upon freezing and thawing with simultaneous
cross-linking. Slow supercooling and ice nucleation at −20
°C make ice crystals grow slowly and exclude nanochitin and cross-linkers,
becoming spatially confined at the interface. At a nanochitin concentration
as low as 0.4 wt %, highly viscoelastic hydrogels are formed, with
a storage modulus of ∼16 kPa, at least an order of magnitude
larger compared to those measured for the strongest chitin-derived
hydrogels reported so far. Moreover, the water absorption capacity
of the hydrogels reaches a value of 466 g g–1. Lyophilization
is effective in producing cryogels with a density that can be tailored
in a wide range of values, from 0.89 to 10.83 mg·cm–3, and corresponding porosity, between 99.24 and 99.94%. Nitrogen
adsorption results indicate reversible adsorption and desorption cycles
of macroporous structures. A fast shape recovery is registered from
compressive stress–strain hysteresis loops. After 80% compressive
strain, the cryogels recovered fast and completely upon load release.
The extreme values in these and other physical properties have not
been achieved before for neither chitin nor nanocellulosic cryogels.
They are explained to be the result of (a) the ultrahigh axial ratio
of the fibrils and strong covalent interactions; (b) the avoidance
of drying before and during processing, a subtle but critical aspect
in nanomanufacturing with biobased materials; and (c) ice templating,
which makes the hydrogels and cryogels suitable for advanced biobased
materials.

==== Body
Chitin, poly(β-(1→4)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine), is the most abundant amino
polysaccharide in the biosphere.1 Due to
its biocompatibility, biodegradability, renewability, and antibacterial
properties, it is considered in diverse applications, including personal
care, cosmetics, and biomaterials.2,3 However, the
narrow window of conditions suitable to isolate or dissolve chitin
has restricted its otherwise incredible potential. Until now, only
few solvents have been found effective in dissolving chitin. They
include LiCl/dimethylacetamide (DMAc), ionic liquids, strong alkali
solutions, and calcium chloride dehydrate-saturated methanol.4−7 However, these dissolution treatments require special conditions
and lead to the destruction of the crystal structure of chitin. Contrary
to the typical, full deconstruction of chitin into macromolecular
solutions, mechanical shearing into nanoparticle suspension allows
the preservation of the hierarchical and multidimensional features
of the material building blocks, notably, high axial ratio chitin
nanofibrils (also termed here as nanochitin, NCh).8 Methods such as acid hydrolysis, mechanical shearing, and
ultrasonication have been employed for the production of nanocelluloses
and nanochitins. They can be dispersed in aqueous media under acid,
alkali, or neutral conditions, depending on the intended applications.9 Nanochitins exhibit structural features similar
to those of nanocelluloses,8 including
their morphology with fibrils’ widths and lengths reaching
several nanometers and microns, respectively.8,10 Due
to their crystalline structure, nanochitins exhibit excellent physical
properties. For example, the strength of α- and β-nanochitins
is estimated to be 1.6 and 3.0 GPa, respectively,11 similar to that of nanocellulose with a tensile strength
of at least 2 GPa.12 However, the energy-intensive
process conditions used so far limit an efficient production and prevent
a wide adoption of nanochitin for material development.8,13 Therefore, the design of facile routes to easily isolate and exploit
nanochitin is a priority.

Previously, hydrogels and aerogels
have been prepared by using
dissolved chitin or chitin nanowhiskers. For dissolved chitin, highly
flexible and tough double-cross-linked hydrogels were obtained with
epichlorohydrin and solvent exchange with aqueous ethanol after dissolution
in KOH/urea solvent.1 Aerogels with densities
as low as 125 mg·cm–3 and porosity as high
as 92% were reported by dissolving chitin in DMA/LiCl followed by
supercritical point drying.14 For nanochitins,
only physically cross-linked hydrogels have been reported,9,15,16 resulting in aerogels with a
lower density compared to that obtained from dissolved chitin, as
low as 43 mg·cm–3 (porosity up to 97%).17 Chemically cross-linked hydrogels and aerogels
have not been attempted but offer possibilities for exploitation of
chitin as a renewable nanomaterial. This is introduced in this work,
with special emphasis on the effects of water removal and ice templating.

Results
and Discussion
After purification and partial deacetylation
(final degree of deacetylation
of 26%),9 chitin was suspended in acid
solution (pH 3), and upon homogenization (15000 rpm, 5 min) followed
by one-pass microfluidization and centrifugation, the length of the
nanochitins reached values of ∼50 μm and widths as low
as 50 nm (axial ratio >100, Figure 1a). The calculated nanofibrillation yield was >85%,
indicating a facile deconstruction of the precursor biomass into nanochitin
at low-energy microfluidization (only one pass was needed). The high
electrostatic charge of the fibrils (ζ-potential of +95 ±
3.5 mV) endowed very stable colloidal suspensions in water.

and by the ruler), which recovers its original shape rapidly, after
reimmersion in water (right image). (d) Photographs of a nanochitin

The process can be extended for many cycles (the images corresponds
to the fourth cycle of compression and decompression).

Nanochitin Hydrogels
The pH shift was effective in
triggering the formation of highly entangled networks from the individual
chitin nanofibrils. Hydrogel synthesis was used here as the first
step for processing. In previous work, gas-phase coagulation was applied
to physically cross-link nanochitin hydrogels and cryogels, resulting
in the stiffest chitin materials reported up to that point.9 However, such physical cross-linking set a limiting
toughness and strength under stress or strain.18 Here, we applied chemical cross-linking, which has not
been attempted before. Considering the abundant amino groups in nanochitin,
glutaraldehyde (Glu) was used for this purpose. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of purified chitin, nanochitin, and chemically
cross-linked nanochitin indicated a new peak in 1750 cm–1, assigned to free aldehydic bonds. Together with an increased peak
corresponding to C–H stretching at 2930 and 1655 cm–1 for imine bonds, the results indicated successful chemical cross-linking
between the chitin nanofibrils (Figure S1).

Strong hydrogels were possible at very low solids content
(≤0.6 wt %) via freezing-induced chemical
cross-linking, making them suitable as drug carriers, tissue scaffolds,
or insulators, which are otherwise derived from complex processing
routes.19,20 However, it was realized that without freezing
but in the presence of a cross-linker, the nanochitin suspension becomes
stable for at least 1 week (time of observation) at room temperature
(Figure S2a,b) (note that in the absence
of cross-linker, the physically cross-linked cryogels returned back
into a liquid suspension after freezing–thawing, Figure S2c). With time, the reaction between
the cross-linker and nanochitin’s amino groups turned the suspension
into a yellowish color (Figure S2b).21 Despite the cross-linking, the electrostatic
repulsion between nanochitins in acidic condition prevented gelling,22 an effect that was observed only after freezing
and thawing the suspension, forming exceptionally strong hydrogels.

Cryogels were obtained from the chemically cross-linked nanochitin
simply by lyophilization of the frozen system described above (Figure 1b). The resulting
nanochitin hydrogels and cryogels were named according to NCh(x)/Glu(y), where x indicates
the mass concentration of the initial nanochitin suspension, and y is the glutaraldehyde/nanochitin mass ratio (Table 1). All the nanochitin
hydrogels and cryogels were both highly flexible and displayed shape
recovery properties (Figure 1c,d). The hydrogels prepared from dilute nanochitin suspension
(0.2 wt %) and compressed to the maximum limit returned to their original
shape a few seconds after immersion in water. Likewise, cryogels prepared
from 0.1 wt % nanochitin recovered reversibly after multiple compression
cycles (Video S1 and Video S2).

Figure 2a,b includes
photographs of nanochitin hydrogels. Weak hydrogels were formed from
0.1 wt % nanochitin suspensions (Figure S3). However, strong hydrogels were produced from suspensions at >0.2
wt % NCh concentration. With increased cross-linker addition, yellowing
increased (compare NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.1) and NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4)), owing
to more extensive cross-linking.

The water absorption
capacity of NCh(x)/Glu(0.4)
hydrogels was reduced at increased nanochitin concentration (466,
296, and 208 g g–1 for 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 wt %, respectively)
(Figure S3). For a fixed nanochitin concentration
(0.4 wt %), the water capacity of the NCh(0.4)/Glu(y) hydrogels decreased from 384 to 162 g g–1 as
the glutaraldehyde ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.4 wt %. The observed
trends in water absorption correlate inversely with the mechanical
strength of the hydrogels, which is otherwise significantly enhanced
with the increase of chitin or cross-linker concentrations.23

It was determined that G′
> G″ for all hydrogels (Figure 2a–d). At an angular
frequency of 0.1
rad·s–1, the hydrogels became stiffer with
nanochitin concentration. G′ values for NCh(x)/Glu(0.4) hydrogels were 1476,
10829, and 11357 Pa prepared at nanochitin concentrations of 0.2,
0.4, and 0.6 wt %, respectively. These values are at least an order
of magnitude larger compared to those measured for the strongest chitin-derived
hydrogels reported so far. The combination of ultralong chitin nanofibrils
and strong covalent interactions is the main reason for this result.
In addition, a denser cross-linking produced stiffer hydrogels (Figure 2b). For NCh(0.4)/Glu(y) hydrogels, G′ = 1423, 5884, 7792, 12601, and 15928 Pa at cross-linker dosage ratios
of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 1.0 wt %, respectively.

Slow and fast
freezing (−20 °C, refrigerator, and −196
°C, liquid nitrogen) were conducted to further understand the
freezing-induced chemical cross-linking. After being washed with water,
the elastic modulus of the obtained hydrogels was 1426 (−20
°C) and 125 (−196 °C) Pa, respectively (Figure 2c). The weaker hydrogels
formed from the fast freezing process, which is related to the insufficient
cross-linking and the role of ice growth. The freezing point of glutaraldehyde
is −14 °C, and at −20 °C, the system was frozen
for 2 h while only 3 min elapsed for the fast freezing at −196
°C. The slow supercooling and ice nucleation at −20 °C
made the ice crystals grow slowly and exclude nanochitin and glutaraldehyde,
which became spatially confined at the interface. It is reasonable
to expect that this effect promotes closer interparticle distances
and more extensive cross-linking.24 In
contrast, at −196 °C, both water and glutaraldehyde froze
rapidly, restricting more efficient chemical cross-linking. Upon thawing,
the mechanical strength of these latter hydrogels was limited. In
contrast, slow freezing significantly improved the efficiency of cross-linking
and produced stronger nanochitin hydrogels. This effect is herein
referred to as “freezing-induced cross-linking”. An
interesting observation is the templating of the material following
radial ice channels (Figure S4), indicating
the possibility of an ordered internal structure in the hydrogels.

Next, we discuss the effect of nanochitin fibril length on the
properties of the hydrogels. A suspension with nanochitins with a
fibril length of up to 6503 ± 636 nm and ζ-potential of
+94.6 ± 3.5 mV was subjected to tip sonication to produce smaller
nanochitins. Sonication for 1 and 30 min reduced the average length
of the fibrils to 4850 ± 39 and 918 ± 22 nm, respectively
(Figure 2e). The respective
values of ζ-potential were +76.60 ± 2.2 and +61.1 ±
0.7 mV.25 Hydrogels were prepared from
NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4) after concentrating the suspensions to the given
concentrations. Compared to G′ of the hydrogels prepared from the original nanochitin (10869 Pa),
smaller values were recorded for the shorter nanochitins: 5817 and
4423 Pa, respectively (Figure 2d). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of hydrogels
produced with NCh of different lengths are shown in Figure S5, which reveal that the pore walls formed under the
predominant presence of long NCh fibrils. The stronger pore walls
formed by the highly interconnected, longer nanochitins is a main
reason for the higher strength of the corresponding hydrogels.26

On the basis of their mechanical integrity
and strength, nanochitin
hydrogels were further studied for their shape recovery when subjected
to water removal and reabsorption. Dehydrated NCh hydrogels rapidly
recovered their initial shape upon immersion in water during given
times (Figure 3a).
Upon compression, the height of the hydrogels prepared from 0.1, 0.2,
and 0.3 wt % NCh concentration was reduced to 18, 25, and 31%, respectively.
After reimmersion in water, complete shape recovery was reached in
4, 6, and 26 s (Figure S6a–c). The
faster shape recovery observed for the hydrogels prepared at lower
NCh concentration is explained by their higher porosity (Table 1) and the better organized
and interconnected structure (see Figure 5 and respective discussion).

Figure 3 (a) Dynamics of shape
recovery, as indicated by the % recovery
from the original height of NCh hydrogels immersed in water during
the given time and as a function of the composition (with 0.4 Glu/NCh
mass ratio) (K is the slope of the given fit). (b) Dynamics of shape
recovery for the NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4) hydrogel after immersion in buffer
solution at pH 2 and 11. (c) Cyclic water sorption capacity of the
NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4) hydrogel. In the experiments, water in the hydrogel
was removed and it was then left to reabsorb water (dehydration–swelling
cycles).

The shape recovery property was
also found to depend on the pH
(Figure 3b). NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4)
hydrogels were subjected to solvent exchange with buffer solution
of pH 2 and 11 followed by compression to 38 and 35% of their initial
height, respectively. After reimmersion in acid buffer solution (pH
2), the hydrogels reached full shape recovery in 100 s. In contrast,
no shape recovery was observed in alkaline buffer solution (pH 11),
even after immersion for several minutes (Figure S6d,e). The results are explained by the protonation of amino
groups of NCh under the acidic condition and the higher hydrophilicity
of the system.9 To test NCh hydrogel reusability,
they were subjected to five compression/immersion cycles (Figure 3c). A small reduction
in water absorption capacity (4% reduction) was determined for freshly
prepared NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4) hydrogels, possibly due to the slight deformation
of the walls within the structure.24

Nanochitin Cryogels
Lyophilization of frozen NCh hydrogels
yielded cryogels with ultralow density and corresponding high porosity.
With the increased NCh concentration, an increased density was measured,
from 0.89 ± 0.22 to 10.83 ± 1.89 mg·cm–3. The corresponding porosity values ranged from 99.24 to 99.94% (Figure 4a). At a given NCh
concentration, higher density and lower porosity were recorded with
the increased cross-linking. The densities of NCh(0.05)/Glu(0.4) and
NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4) cryogels were 0.89 ± 0.22 and 1.28 ± 0.24
mg·cm–3, considerably lower than the values
reported so far for chitin cryogels (4.8 to 100 mg·cm–3) and even lower than those reported for nanocellulose-based cryogels
(1.7 to 10 mg·cm–3).2,14,17,20,27 It should be noted that the cryogel produced with
the lowest nanochitin concentration, NCh(0.05)/Glu(0.4), was strong
enough to sustain handling, but it did not withstand cycles of compression–decompression
(Figure S7a–c). In contrast, the
NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4) cryogel displayed excellent shape recovery properties:
even after severe compression, the cryogel recovered fully, with no
apparent permanent deformation (Figure 1d). Moreover, the shape recovery occurred immediately
after load release (Video S1). In the absence
of cross-linker and upon compression, the cryogel prepared from 0.1
wt % nanochitin suspension was irreversibly collapsed into a membrane
(Figure S7d–f).

Figure 4 (a) Density and porosity
of nanochitin cryogels as a function of
nanochitin concentration in the precursor suspension with 0.4 Glu/NCh
mass ratio. (b) Compressive stress–strain hysteresis of NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4)
cryogels. (c) Photographs of NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4) cryogel (left) that
was lifted with a plastic spoon by static electricity (right). The
density and porosity of this cryogel was 1.53 mg·cm–3 and 99.89%, respectively.

The compressive stress–strain hysteresis was measured
(Figure 4b) and indicated
that the NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4) cryogel exhibited the largest shape recovery,
withstanding over 80% compressive strain and recovering completely
once the load was released. For NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.1) and NCh(0.6)/Glu(0.4)
cryogels, complete shape recovery was also achieved after 30% compression.
In these latter cases, only partial shape recovery took place for
relatively higher compression levels (60 or 80% strain compression)
(Figure S8a,b).

The pore structures
of NCh(0.2)/Glu(0.4), NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.1), NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4),
and NCh(0.6)/Glu(0.4) cryogels were analyzed via nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
BET, Figure S8c). The specific surface
was reduced as nanochitin or cross-linker concentration increased,
25, 22, 17, and 12 m2·g–1, Table 1). The BET results
indicate reversible adsorption and desorption cycles, with no sign
of leveling-off at high relative pressures, which is typical of nonporous
and macroporous structures, as supported by SEM imaging (Figure 5). All the cryogels exhibited highly porous structures, but
the pores were distributed nonhomogeneously, with sizes ranging from
a few to hundreds of micrometers. At a cross-linker ratio of 0.4,
tight film-like pore walls and less fibrillar structures were observed.
Also, smaller but better enclosed pores were observed at increasing
nanochitin concentrations (Figure 5a,c,d,f,h).

Figure 5 SEM images of nanochitin cryogel prepared from
different hydrogel
compositions: (a) NCh(0.05)/Glu(0.4), (b) NCh(0.1)/Glu(0), (c) NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4),
(d) NCh(0.2)/Glu(0.4), (e) NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.1), (f) NCh(0.4)/Glu(0.4),
(g) NCh(0.4)/Glu(1.0), and (h) NCh(0.6)/Glu(0.4). The insets correspond
to images at higher magnification, highlighting the pore walls.

As the NCh(0.05)/Glu(0.4) cryogel
was too weak to support cyclic
compression, whereas those prepared at higher NCh concentrations sustained
full recovery, it is reasonable to assume that the film-like pore
walls observed in SEM favored shape recovery. As shown in the insets
of Figure 5, all film-like
pore walls were supported by assembled nanochitin fibrils. However,
both NCh(0.1)/Glu(0) and NCh(0.1)/Glu(0.4) showed NCh-supported film
structures. Interestingly, the NCh(0.1)/Glu(0) cryogel was collapsed
into a membrane-like shape after compression (Figure S7d–f).

Chemical cross-linking is believed
to play a key role in shape
recovery. Chemical cross-linking of chitosan membranes has been shown
to increase the strength but reduce the elongation.28 In our system, interconnected nanochitin pore walls became
stiffer with the extent of cross-linking. For nanochitin-based films,
a higher tensile strength was achieved with longer fibrils.16 Similarly, stronger pore walls are expected
from the longer fibrils, resulting in stronger nanochitin cryogels.
Interestingly, adjacent pore walls were connected with ultralong NCh
fibrils (compare Figure 5b and Figure 5c),
an effect that likely enhances the mechanical strength of the system.

At constant NCh concentration (0.4 wt %), increased cross-linker
loading led to less interconnected and smaller pore walls, resulting
in faster and more efficient cross-linking, as previously discussed
(Figure 5e–g).
However, the NCh(0.4)/Glu(1.0) cryogels were brittle and, under compression,
displayed no shape recovery (Figure S7g,h). This indicates that excessive cross-linking has a negative effect.
Therefore, uniform film-like pore walls, better-interconnected morphology,
and higher stiffness by chemical cross-linking benefit the shape recovery
of nanochitin cryogels and hydrogels.

Conclusions
A
facile and high-yield (85%) method is proposed to produce ultralong
chitin nanofibrils that form shape-recoverable hydrogels and cryogels
after a freeze-induced chemical cross-linking. The high stiffness,
porosity, and excellent compliance of the hydrogels and cryogels,
even if prepared from very diluted aqueous suspensions, offer excellent
prospects for nanochitins in the synthesis of advanced materials and
in applications that benefit from their properties, including tissue
engineering, drug delivery, thermal insulation, and air filtration.

Methods
Materials
Fresh
crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were acquired
in the local market of Helsinki harbor, Finland.
The crabs were cooked and the meat was consumed while the residual
shells were collected and purified. Glutaraldehyde cross-linker solution
(25%) and 100% acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany.
Commercial pH 2 buffer solution (density = 1 kg L–1) and pH 11 buffer solution (density = 1 kg L–1) were purchased from VWR Chemicals, Belgium. All chemicals were
used without further purification.

Chitin extraction
The purification steps are briefly
summarized as follows: the residual biomass was soaked in 1 M HCl
for 12 h followed by treatment with 1 M NaOH for 12 h. These two steps
were repeated at least three times. The obtained residual solid was
decolorized by immersion in 0.5% (w/w) NaClO2, and the
pH was adjusted to 5 using acetic acid, followed by heating for at
least for 2 h at 70 °C. The purified chitin solid residues were
obtained after washing with distilled water. Finally, the obtained
flake chitin solids were crushed using a household blender and stored
at 4 °C for further use. Notably, the material was always kept
in the wet state (never dried).

Nanofibrillation of Chitin
The chitin solids were subjected
to deacetylation following a procedure modified from the literature.16,22 Briefly, purified chitin was treated with 33% (w/w) NaOH solution
at 90 °C for 4 h. Then, the partially deacetylated chitin was
washed with water and stored at 4 °C until use. Finally, the
partially deacetylated chitin was dispersed in water at a concentration
of 0.3% (w/v), and acetic acid was added under stirring to adjust
the pH to 3.

The obtained suspension was homogenized (IKA T-25
ULTRA-TURRAX digital homogenizer) at 10000 rpm for 5 min followed
by passing only one time through the microfluidizer (M-110P, Microfluidics
In., Newton, MA, USA) using 400 and 200 μm chambers at a pressure
of 1500 bar. After centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 3 min to remove
the large particles, the supernatant was collected as the nanochitin
suspension.

Nanochitin Hydrogels and Cryogels
Nanochitin suspensions
were concentrated by partial water removal at 90 °C or diluted
using acetic acid solution (pH 3), reaching mass concentrations of
0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 wt %. The cross-linker was added to the suspension
for given glutaraldehyde/nanochitin mass ratios (1:10, 1:2.5, or 1:1).
The respective system was then treated with bath sonication USC-TH
(VWR, USA) to mix and remove air bubbles. The resulting suspension
was sealed in a 15 mL plastic centrifuge tube and frozen overnight
in a refrigerator (−20 °C). For hydrogel synthesis, the
frozen nanochitin samples were thawed at room temperature for 2 h.
After being washed with water, nanochitin hydrogels were obtained.
For the preparation of fast freezing samples, after nanochitin and
cross-linker were mixed, the NCh(0.2)/Glu(0.4) system was immersed
in liquid nitrogen for 3 min (and stored in refrigerator after freezing).

For cryogel synthesis, the frozen samples were lyophilized for
2 days (FreeZone 2.5, LABCONCO, USA). Samples included physically
cross-linked (no cross-linker added), chemically cross-linked (cross-linker/nanochitin
= 1:1) hydrogels and cryogels, as well as nanochitin suspensions.

Chemical Characterization
FTIR spectra were recorded
in the region of 4000–400 cm–1 on a Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer using Nicolet 380 (Thermo Scientific,
USA). For testing, the purified chitin and nanochitin suspensions
were dried at 60 °C to eliminate water from the samples.

Dispersion
Stability
ζ-Potential measurements
were conducted to access the dispersion stability of nanochitin using
a Zeta-sizer ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) at 25 °C. The concentrations
of all samples were the same (0.1%), the pH was adjusted to ∼3,
and the dispersion conductivity was measured to be ∼0.74 mS·cm–1.9

Morphology
The
nanochitin morphology was observed by
transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai 12 Bio-Twin, FEI, USA).
A drop of nanochitin suspension (0.01%) was deposited on electron
microscope grids coated with carbon-reinforced formavar film and allowed
to dry, followed by observation at an acceleration voltage of 120
kV. The cross-sectional morphology of cryogels was evaluated by scanning
electron microscope using a Sigma VP (ZEISS, Germany) SEM unit operating
at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Samples were coated with Pt before
examination. The nanochitin dispersion was diluted to 0.001% (w/w)
with distilled water, placed on a mica plate, and dried at room temperature.
The morphologies of the nanochitin were observed using a Dimension
Edge atomic force microscope (Bruker, Germany) in tapping mode using
a standard silicon cantilever.

The specific surface area and
pore characteristics of the NCh cryogels were determined by N2 adsorption at 77.35 K on a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020
surface area and pore size analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). Approximately
0.05 g of each sample was degassed at 80 °C for 3 h. The specific
surface area was determined by the BET method.

Hydrogel Rheology and Water
Absorption
Frequency sweeps
for nanochitin hydrogels were applied on an MCR 302 unit (Anton Paar
Physica, Austria) equipped with parallel plates PP25/P2 (d = 25 mm). The measurements were conducted under a force of 0.1 N
at 23 °C.

Water absorption capacity of the nanochitin hydrogels
was calculated from eq 1: 1  where Wt and Wo are the weight of
hydrogels before and after
drying at 105 °C.

Shape Recovery
The shape recovery
of nanochitin hydrogels
was determined from the height of hydrogels in water. Before analysis,
nanochitin hydrogels were pressed and water was removed by using filter
paper. After compression, the nanochitin hydrogels were immersed in
water or buffer solution to determine the extent of shape recovery
(eq 2): 2  where Ho is the
height of freshly prepared hydrogel before compression, and Ht is the height of the hydrogel after immersion
in water or buffer solution, as a function of time.

Physical and
Mechanical Properties
The dimensions (length
and diameter) and mass of nanochitin cryogels shaped as cylinders
were measured using a digital caliper and balance (resolution of 0.01
mm and 0.01 mg, respectively). The density of the cryogel (ρa) was calculated simply using eq 3: 3  where ρc is the
density of
chitin, 1425 g·cm–3.29 Cylindrical cryogels (∼13 mm diameter and ∼10 mm height)
were used for dynamic mechanical analyses (TA Instruments Q800 DMA,
TA, USA) applying strain rate mode (strain rate of 10% strain per
min).
