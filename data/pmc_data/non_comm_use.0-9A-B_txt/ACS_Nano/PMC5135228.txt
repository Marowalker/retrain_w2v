Diarylethene
molecules are prototype molecular switches with their
two isomeric forms exhibiting strikingly different conductance, while
maintaining similar length. We employed low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) to resolve the energy and the spatial extend of the
molecular orbitals of the open and closed isomers when lying on a
Au(111) surface. We find an intriguing difference in the extension
of the respective HOMOs and a peculiar energy splitting of the formerly
degenerate LUMO of the open isomer. We then lift the two isomers with
the tip of the STM and measure the current through the individual
molecules. By a simple analytical model of the transport, we show
that the previously determined orbital characteristics are essential
ingredients for the complete understanding of the transport properties.
We also succeeded in switching the suspended molecules by the current,
while switching the ones which are in direct contact to the surface
occurs nonlocally with the help of the electric field of the tip.

==== Body
One challenge
for molecular
electronics is the creation of single molecule devices whose conductance
can be remotely controlled between two distinguishable states.1 For this approach, molecular switches are designed
with isomeric states, which can be interconverted reversibly by external
stimuli, such as, e.g., electrons,2−4 photons,5−7 or electric fields.8,9 For applications
in electronic devices, molecular switches must fulfill the following
two important requirements: First, the switching behavior needs to
be preserved when the molecule is contacted to electrodes.10 Second, the conductance of both isomers has
to differ drastically, leading to a significant “on–off”
ratio.

For this purpose, diarylethenes (DAE) are an interesting
molecular
class.11 DAE can be switched between a
ring-closed and a ring-opened form by breaking a C–C bond and
the conjugation of the π–electron system. Thereby, the
conductance properties are strongly modified, while the geometry of
the molecule is only slightly changed, which makes DAE suitable for
single molecule devices. Hence, it is not surprising that in the past
decade, electron transport through DAE and derivatives was intensively
studied.7,10,12−17 Depending on the chemical composition of the switching unit, the
anchoring groups, or the nature of the electrodes, the switching and
conductance properties vary significantly. In particular, it was shown
that modifying the electronic structure of the molecule or the electronic
coupling to the electrodes can have a drastic effect on the ability
of the molecular junction to switch and, likewise, on the “on–off”
ratio of the molecular conductance. In order to design the ”ideal”
molecular switch, it is therefore of crucial importance to have a
thorough understanding of the parameters governing the transport properties
of the lead–molecule–lead junction.

Measuring
the charge transport through individual molecules is
a challenging task. It has been well mastered in break junction experiments,
where individual molecules are trapped between metallic leads and
the junction conductance is measured at variable electrode distance
and bias voltage.15,18−20 A scanning
tunneling microscope offers the capability to contact molecules and
lift them from the surface, thus resembling traditional break junction
experiments, but with a precisely controlled contact point on the
molecule.21−24 Moreover, the molecules can be characterized when lying on the surface.
This yields complementary information on the molecular structure and
molecular orbitals, which is particularly useful for the investigation
of molecular switches, as it allows to distinguish the isomers individually.3,4,8,9,25−27

Here we investigate
1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-((Z)-(2-cyano-2-(pyridin-4-yl)vinyl))furan-3-yl)
hexafluorocyclopentene (C5F-4Py)28 (Figure 1a) on a Au(111) surface
with low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning
tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and STM-based break junction experiments.
C5F-4Py is a DAE with oxygen containing furyl, instead of the commonly
used sulfur bearing thiophenyl aryl-rings. The idea behind this choice
is to reduce possible interactions with a metallic substrate and,
therefore, to facilitate manipulation with the STM tip. First, we
show that the molecules exclusively adsorb in the open form, but can
be switched into the closed form by voltage pulses from the STM tip.
Tunneling spectroscopy and mapping of the spatial orbital distribution
allows for an unambiguous identification of the open and closed isomers.
We then use the STM tip to controllably lift single molecules from
the surface and study their charge-transport properties. As already
reported from break-junction experiments with the same molecule,15 we observe a large difference in conductance
between the open and closed isomers. We model the observed transport
properties with the orbitals characteristics, obtained from the STS
mapping of the corresponding molecules. In particular, we identify
the importance of the localization versus delocalization
of transport states and their level splitting, which require hopping
between different states along the molecule. Finally, we show that
we can induce a switching back into the open form, while the molecule
is suspended between the metallic electrodes, by increasing the bias
close to the energy of the LUMO state.

Results and Discussion
Organization
of Molecular Island and Switching
After
evaporation of the open C5F-4Py molecules from the chemically pure
powder onto a clean Au(111) surface (see Experimental
Methods), we observe ordered molecular islands with a square
pattern (Figure 1b).
The two islands that we discern on this large-scale STM topography
are rotated by about 120° with respect to each other, in agreement
with the 3-fold symmetry of the substrate. On the high-resolution
image of a molecular island shown in Figure 1c, one molecule has been removed with the
STM tip. This allows for a better perception of the molecular arrangement.
We propose that one unit cell consists of four molecules, each rotated
by 90° (indicated by the superimposed molecular structure in Figure 1c). The brightest
part (“head” or top part) can be associated with the
switching unit of the molecule, while the two “legs”
with the pyridine groups are lower. This appearance indicates an almost
flat-lying configuration due to van der Waals interactions (see Supporting Information). We note an asymmetry
at the fluorinated part of the molecule, which is not observed in
the gas-phase optimized molecular geometry. In rare cases, single
molecules are found on the surface, which show a more symmetric shape
(see Supporting Information). This suggests
a modification of the molecular geometry within the island, induced
by molecule–molecule interactions in the closed-packed structure.

In the STM images shown in Figure 1b,c, we observe only one configuration of the molecule
but yet can not determine if this is the open or closed isomer (see
below). A second one is obtained by applying a voltage pulse in proximity
of the molecular islands. Figure 2a,b displays the change in the STM topography before
and after a voltage pulse of 10 V for 100 s, with the tip retracted
by 5 nm, has been applied at the position marked by the white cross.
After the pulse, some molecules appear brighter with an increased
apparent height of ∼1 Å. These changes can also be observed
for smaller voltage pulses when the tip is closer to the surface.
But below 7 V, the required tip-surface is so small that a high tunneling
current traverses the molecules. In many of these cases, this leads
to a destruction of the molecules. Furthermore, we note that switching
does occur not only locally underneath the tip but also within a radius
of up to 60 nm. The long-range effect suggests the involvement of
the electric field in the switching mechanism.8 Note that all modified molecules present a similar electronic structure,
as will be discussed in the next section. Moreover, back-switching
events were sometimes observed, even though we could not find a reliable
protocol to induce this process (see Supporting Information). These observations prove that the switched molecules
are intact and not destroyed.

Figure 2 STM images (a) before and (b) after a voltage
pulse realized at
the position marked by the white cross, with a positive voltage of
10 V applied for 100 s and a tip retraction of 5 nm from the set-point
position (STM topographies: V = 0.8 V, I = 40 pA.).

Isomer Identification
Until now, we have shown that
we can switch the molecule on the surface to a second form. However,
no association has been made with the open and closed isomer of the
diarylethene C5F-4Py. As the open form is used for the evaporation,
it seems likely that molecules assembled on the surface are initially
found in their open form (Figure 2a). Hence, the brighter molecule obtained after the
voltage pulse might be of the closed form. In order to verify this
assumption, we investigate the electronic structure of the two distinct
isomers with STS experiments. Figure 3b shows dI/dV spectra
recorded on top of a molecule before (black) and after (red) switching
(see associated crosses in Figure 3a). For the molecule before switching, we observe a
resonance at −2 V, which we assign to tunneling through the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). At positive bias, there
is a first increase of conductance around 1.2–1.4 V and a second
one at 2 V (for discussion of their origin see below). For the molecule
after switching, the spectrum is drastically different: In both bias
polarities, the molecular orbitals are resonant at lower voltages
with −1.1 V for the HOMO and +0.8 V for the LUMO. Therefore,
the HOMO–LUMO gap is significantly smaller after the switching
(1.9 V) than before (3.2–3.4 V). This difference matches with
the switching from a nonconjugated (larger gap) to fully conjugated
(smaller gap) molecules and is in agreement with DFT calculations
in gas phase (see Supporting Information). It confirms our assumption that molecules before and after switching
correspond to open and closed forms, respectively. In the following,
open and closed forms will be used to address each form of the molecule.

(7 × 7 nm2, V = 0.02 V, I = 75 pA). (b) dI/dV spectra recorded
on a modified (red) and a nonmodified (black) molecule where indicated
with crosses in the STM image. (c–g) Constant current dI/dV maps of the area framed by the black
(c–e) and red (f–g) rectangles in the image in (a).
The voltages used for these maps correspond to the energy of the molecular
states observed in the dI/dV spectra
shown in (b). The molecular model is overlaid in these maps for a
better perception.

The energy of the molecular
states is not the only difference between
the electronic structures of conjugated and nonconjugated molecules.
The spatial extension of the molecular orbitals is also expected to
be different. Therefore, we record conductance maps of the two isomers
at the energies corresponding to their molecular states. The closed
form (Figure 3f–g)
exhibits a high conductance signal over almost the whole molecule
(except at the extremities of the legs) for both states (−1.1
V and +0.8 V). This agrees with the expectation of delocalized states
in conjugated molecules. For the open form, we observe different orbital
localizations (Figure 3c–e). The HOMO (at −2 V) is localized on the switching
unit, with almost no conductance on the two legs. The dI/dV signal from the two unoccupied states (at +1.4
and +1.95 V) is localized on the switching unit and one leg, but a
different leg for each state.

This localization of the molecular
states is expected for a nonconjugated
molecule. However, we note the surprising asymmetry of the unoccupied
states. DFT calculations reveal that the LUMO is doubly degenerate
in the gas phase, with the electron density being slightly more localized
over one or the other leg (see Supporting Information).29 Thus, we suggest that the resonances
at +1.4 and 2 V correspond to these two lifted degenerated molecular
orbitals. We ascribe the large splitting between these two states
(0.6 V) to the breaking of symmetry when the molecule is adsorbed
on the surface.

Charge-Transport Measurements
By
using the atomically
precise manipulation capabilities of the STM, we investigate the charge-transport
properties of the molecule and its two isomers. Figure 4 explains the principle of this measurement.
First, the tip is positioned above one leg of the molecule (white
cross on Figure 4a).
Then, while the conductance of the junction is recorded, the tip is
approached until it contacts the molecule and retracted afterward. Figure 4c displays the conductance versus tip–sample distance, z, for
a successful lifting experiment with a closed isomer at a bias voltage
of 50 mV. Regime I of the curve corresponds to the approach of the
tip toward the molecule (sketched in Figure 4d). In this regime, the conductance increases
exponentially, while the tip height is reduced, as expected for a
tunneling barrier. We identify the contact formation between the tip
and the molecule by an abrupt increase of the conductance known as
“jump to contact”. Subsequently, the tip is retracted,
and the conductance decreases, but remains significantly larger than
during the approach. This confirms that the molecule is suspended
between the tip and the surface (regime II). We note that this regime
starts with an exponential decrease. This signifies transport through
a tunneling barrier, but with a smaller decay constant than vacuum.
Further lifting leads to a quasi-plateau in the conductance. Upon
further tip retraction (regime III), we observe a sudden conductance
drop, followed by an exponential decrease with a similar slope as
for the approach. This behavior indicates that the whole molecule
is detached from the surface with an additional gap below the suspended
molecule.22,30 Scanning the area again after this lifting
procedure, indeed, shows that the molecule has been removed from the
island (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 STM images
of a molecular island (a) before and (b) after the lifting
procedure realized at the white cross location (7 × 7 nm2, V = 0.1 V, I = 40 pA).
Before the image in (b) is recorded, the tip is cleaned to not have
the lifted molecule on the tip apex. (c) Evolution of the conductance
as a function of z, i.e., the tip height, during the lifting of a molecule. This procedure
includes an approach of the tip until a contact with the molecule
is formed (regime I) and subsequent retraction, until the molecule
is detached from the surface (regimes II and III). The bias applied
at the junction is 50 mV. (d) Scheme of the junction corresponding
to the different sections in the curve in (c).

We carried out this lifting procedure for a set of 63 molecules
of closed and open states. Figure 5a shows typical conductance traces of closed (red)
and open (black) C5F-4Py. As expected, we observe a larger conductance
for the closed isomer than for the open isomer. Figure 5b shows a histogram of the conductance, measured
on the plateau of the curve (average value in the gray rectangle)
for more than 30 molecules of each isomer. The average value obtained
for the closed form is 2.8 × 10–4G0 and 6.1 × 10–6G0 for the open form, respectively. The large “on/off”
ratio of 45 between the two isomers is in agreement with the results
of break junction experiments on the same molecule.15

during the lifting of an open (black) and a closed (red) molecule
at a bias of 50 mV. (b) Histogram of ln(G/G0) recorded for 31 (32) open (closed) molecules.
The value of the conductance is obtained by averaging the G(z) curve in the plateau region (see gray
rectangle in a). The arrows show the position of the average conductance
obtained with the statistics.

We explain this difference of conductance with a simple analytical
model. The most common model used for transport through a molecular
junction is the resonant tunneling model as shown in Figure 6a, in which the transport is
dominated by one or two molecular levels (HOMO and LUMO in our case).31 These levels are defined by two parameters:
their energy ϵ with respect to the Fermi level of the electrodes
(L and R) and Γ, which describes the strength of the electronic
coupling to the metallic electrodes and determines the broadening
of the resonant level. For simplicity, we first consider a symmetric
coupling to both electrodes, i.e., ΓL = ΓR = Γ = 100 meV.
Thus, the energy-dependent transmission of the junction can be described
with a Breit–Wigner distribution for each level: 1  

Figure 6 Schemes of
the model used to explain differences of conductance.
(a) For the closed form, the molecule is represented by two states
(HOMO and LUMO), with an electronic coupling (Γ), which is the
same for both states and both electrodes (L and R). (b) For the open
form, the LUMO is represented by two states with a hopping parameter
(tH), which links them. The electronic
coupling to the electrode for the LUMO (ΓL) is different
than the one for the HOMO (ΓH). The dI/dV maps associated with each of the states are
shown next to the models.

Figure 7a
displays
the T(E) function using this model
with the level energies determined from the experimental dI/dV spectra, i.e., −1.1 eV and +0.8 eV for the closed form (red
line) and −2 eV and +1.4 eV for the open form (black dashed
line). The value of the transmission at the Fermi energy T(EF), is only a factor of 3 different
for the conductance between the open and closed forms (Tc(EF)/To(EF)). Hence, it is more than
1 order of magnitude lower than for the experiment. We note that the
Γ parameter chosen for these curves is 100 meV, corresponding
to the average broadening of the molecular states for the molecule
adsorbed on the surface (Figure 3b). We can expect that the detachment of the molecule
from the surface will reduce the broadening and also the value of
Γ. However, reducing the value of Γ down to 1 meV, a which
is already an extreme lower limit for our system,15,20,23,24 without changing
the ratio between the open and the closed forms, does not drastically
affect the ratio Tc(EF)/To(EF). It only changes between 2.7 and 3.2. Hence, this simple
model alone cannot account for the large difference of conductance
between the two isomers.

the model of the
simple Breit−Wigner distribution from the states of the closed
molecule (red line) and the open one (dashed black line), and with

and closed models, as a function of the hopping parameter tH and for different values of electronic coupling

closed models, as a function of the ratio of the electronic coupling

open and closed models without considering the hopping model for the
open form, as a function of the ratio of the electronic coupling (Γ/ΓH), for different values of Γ (with Γ = ΓL).

As seen in the experiments above,
the different HOMO–LUMO
gap is not the only difference between the conjugated and nonconjugated
molecules. We have already realized above that the double degeneracy
of the LUMO of the open isomer was lifted on the surface with each
component being localized on a different leg. Naively, the transport
thus can be considered by resonant tunneling through coupled molecular
orbitals. This is, e.g., similar
to the transport through a dihydrogen bridge.32 The corresponding model is sketched in Figure 6b, with the LUMO defined by the two on-site
levels coupled together by a hopping parameter tH. Each state is coupled to the nearby electrode by the broadening
parameter Γ. tH is associated with
the energy splitting of the two states ΔE,
such as ΔE = 2tH. Thereby, the transmission function for the open-form LUMO states
is given by32,33 2  where ϵL is the energy of
the LUMO without splitting, i.e.,
≈ 1.7 eV. By adding to this transmission function
a usual Breit–Wigner distribution for transport through the
HOMO, we obtain the total T(E) curve
shown in Figure 7a
(black solid line). We observe that in the gap, the transmission is
reduced compared to the first model, and the ratio Tc(EF)/To(EF) has increased to ∼9.
Note that the hopping parameter for this curve is tH = 0.3 eV, i.e., chosen
for the case of the molecule in an island with a splitting ΔE = 0.6 eV. We may also consider that during the lifting,
the molecule is less perturbed by the substrate, and its properties
are more similar to those of the free molecule, i.e., a reduced tH. However,
changing the value of tH between 0.5 and
0.05 eV (and also Γ) does not affect the result significantly
(see Figure 7b). Finally,
considering this hopping model, the calculated ratio Tc(EF)/To(EF) is increased, but still not
sufficiently high to explain our experimental results. Next, we also
consider the influence of the HOMO state. The HOMO of the open isomer
is localized in the center of the molecule (Figure 3c), whereas it is delocalized along the closed
isomer. Contacting the molecule at the legs, thus, inevitably leads
to a difference in the coupling to the HOMO in the two isomers.34 Our picture accounts for this difference by
assuming different broadening parameters associated with the HOMOs. Figure 7c shows the evolution
of the ratio Tc(EF)/To(EF) versus the ratio Γ/ΓH,
where ΓH is the broadening parameter for the HOMO
state of the open isomer (see Figure 6b). We observe that Tc(EF)/To(EF) increases quickly and reaches the value of the experimentally
observed difference of the conductance (≈45) for a ratio Γ/ΓH between 2 and 3.

We cannot determine a precise value
for the ratio Γ/ΓH, as we do not know the exact
value of Γ and tH. Nevertheless,
in a realistic range of values
for these two parameters, the qualitative description of the system
does not change (see different curves in Figure 7c). The disparity of conductance measured
experimentally cannot be exclusively explained with a lower coupling
for the HOMO state, as shown by Figure 7d nor by exclusively taking into account the hopping
process for the LUMO state. Instead, both aspects have to be considered.

We now turn back to the conductance G(z) curves in Figure 5a of the individual molecules. Here, we find indications that
our above-described model is indeed correct and involves the spatial
characteristics of HOMO and LUMO of the isomers. First, the conductance
at the contact (z = 0), which mainly depends on the
electronic coupling to the electrodes, i.e., Γ, is lower for the open form, in agreement with
the more localized nature of the HOMO in this isomer. On average,
we find a factor of 4 of disparity between the open and the closed
forms (see Supporting Information). During
the lifting, the conductance decreases faster with z for the open form than for the closed one, to reach the ratio of
45 just before the molecules are completely detached from the surface
(plateau regime). This dependence of the conductance during the lifting
reveals the intrinsic ability of the molecule to transport electrons,
which is regulated by the electronic structure of the molecule, energetically
and spatially. This is described by the additional hopping parameter,
which was included to describe transport through the split LUMO of
the open isomer. Thus, our analytical model depicts also these two
different contributions, with the influence of ΓH for the electronic coupling and the difference in the energy of
the states and the hopping parameter for the intrinsic properties
of the molecule.

Note that quantum interferences could in principle
affect the electron
transport through the open isomer.35,36 However, this
would require a considerable overlap term between the HOMO and the
LUMO. But considering the large energy difference between the states
and their drastic localization, the overlap between the HOMO and LUMO
should be strongly reduced, and quantum interferences are unlikely.

Switching Events during Molecular Lifting
While a high
on–off conductance ratio is important for a molecular device,
another challenging key issue for the application of molecular switches
is the ability to change the conductance of the molecule while it
is bridging the electrodes.10 For this
purpose, we lift a closed isomer as shown in Figure 8a, with the principle presented previously
(Figure 4). But instead
of lifting it completely, the tip retraction is stopped around z = 6 Å, while the molecule is still suspended between
tip and surface (red line in Figure 8c).

Figure 8 STM images (a) before and (b) after a lifting experiment.
(c) G(z) curve at 50 mV. The red
curve is recorded
when a closed molecule (indicated by red cross in a) is lifted. The
blue curve is recorded with the same molecule, but after a current
drop was measured when a voltage ramp was applied while the molecule
was suspended (see inset). The black curve, for comparison, is a typical G(z) curve measured with an open molecule.
(d) dI/dV spectra recorded on top
of the molecule before (red curve) and after (blue curve) the lifting
experiment are shown in (c). The black curve, for comparison, is a
typical spectrum recorded on an open molecule.

At low bias, the junction is stable, and no spontaneous change
is observed. But when the bias is ramped up, a huge current drop occurs
between 0.4 and 0.6 eV (see inset in Figure 8c). To check the conductance properties after
this change, a new G(z) curve is
recorded (blue line in Figure 8c), which shows a similar behavior as G(z) curves recorded during the lifting of open molecules
(black line). This suggests that the molecule switched from the closed
to the open form. In order to confirm this, the molecule is placed
back on the surface. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the
molecular structure alone from the STM image recorded after this manipulation
(Figure 8b), due to
a possibly different adsorption of the molecule. However, from STS
measurements, the change of conformation is more convincing (Figure 8d). The spectrum
after the switching (blue) resembles the usual spectra recorded on
open molecules (black curve) and thus suggests the successful switching
back.

This experiment proves that the C5F-4Py molecule can be
switched,
and i.e., its conductance while
it is directly connected to electrodes. The required voltage for this
switching event corresponds to the onset of the LUMO state. Switching
from the closed to the open state was rarely observed for molecules
adsorbed on the surface. In the flat-lying configuration, the switching
is probably quenched by substrate–molecule or molecule–molecule
interactions, whereas the lifting reduces these interactions. Unfortunately,
no switching from the open to closed form was observed when the molecule
was suspended between the electrodes. The required voltage corresponding
to the molecular orbitals of the open form might be too high to be
accessed in the experiments, instead the molecule is detached or destroyed.

Conclusion
We found a direct correlation of electronic structure
and transport
properties of individual diarylethene molecules (C5F-4Py), which can
be captured in a simple analytical model. We showed that the as-adsorbed
molecules reside in their open form on a Au(111) surface, but can
undergo a ring-closing reaction in the presence of an electric field
of the STM tip. The two isomers exhibit distinct differences in the
energy and the spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals. Hence,
they feature an ideal model system to study transport properties through
molecules of different electronic structure but similar geometrical
length. The STM allows to choose a precharacterized molecule from
the surface and then measure the conductance through this very molecule
anchored to the STM tip. Similar to previous experiments, we observe
a high ratio of conductance between the closed and the open forms.
While extensive DFT calculations are often performed to calculate
conductance ratios, we propose a purely analytical model based on
the results of our STS experiments. This analytical model takes into
account the differences of energy and localization of the molecular
transport states as well as the electronic coupling to the electrodes
and, thus, explains the observed conductance ratio. It may seem surprising
that the molecular orbital properties of the flat-lying molecule are
very similar to the lifted one. We ascribe this to the three-dimensional
nature and O-terminated switching unit of the diarylethene, which
prohibits a very strong hybridization of the molecular states with
the substrate. The electronic coupling to the leads (STM tip and substrate)
in the lifted configuration does then have a similar impact. Thus,
by combining the imaging, spectroscopic, and manipulation abilities
of the STM, we succeed in correlating the electronic structure and
the transport properties of a molecular switch. Finally, we also showed
that the molecule can be switched back to the open form while it is
lifted by applying a voltage close to the LUMO energy.

Experimental Methods
The C5F-4Py diarylethene was synthesized
according to ref (28). The Au(111) sample was
cleaned by repeated Ne+ sputtering and annealing cycles. The molecules
were evaporated from a Knudsen cell at 440 K onto the Au(111) surface
held at room temperature in ultrahigh vacuum. The tungsten STM tip
was covered with gold by indentation into the clean surface. The quality
of the tip was checked on the clean surface by observing the gold
surface state in spectroscopy. All STM measurements were done in a
home-built STM at a temperature of 4.8 K. Differential conductance
spectra were recorded with an open feedback-loop using lock-in detection
with a modulation frequency of 910 Hz and a root-mean-square modulation
amplitude of 10 mV. For the lifting of the molecules, the vertical
manipulations (approach and retraction) are realized with a speed
around 1 Å/s.
