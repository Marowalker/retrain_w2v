Films
of colloidal CsPbX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) nanocrystals,
prepared by solution drop-casting or spin-coating on a silicon substrate,
were exposed to a low flux of X-rays from an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer
source, causing intermolecular C=C bonding of the organic ligands
that coat the surface of the nanocrystals. This transformation of
the ligand shell resulted in a greater stability of the film, which
translated into the following features: (i) Insolubility of the exposed
regions in organic solvents which caused instead complete dissolution
of the unexposed regions. This enabled the fabrication of stable and
strongly fluorescent patterns over millimeter scale areas. (ii) Inhibition
of the irradiated regions toward halide anion exchange reactions,
when the films were exposed either to halide anions in solution or
to hydrohalic vapors. This feature was exploited to create patterned
regions of different CsPbIxBryClz compositions, starting
from a film with homogeneous CsPbX3 composition. (iii)
Resistance of the films to degradation caused by exposure to air and
moisture, which represents one of the major drawbacks for the integration
of these materials in devices. (iv) Stability of the film in water
and biological buffer, which can open interesting perspectives for
applications of halide perovskite nanocrystals in aqueous environments.

==== Body
Lead halide
perovskites are
currently the focus of a considerable research effort, owing to their
important optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties.1−16 Also, various colloidal synthesis routes toward nanocrystals (NCs)
of these materials have been recently demonstrated, with control over
size, shape, mixed halide composition, and consequently emission wavelength.17 Furthermore, it has been shown that these materials,
both in bulk and in nanocrystalline form, can undergo fast anion-exchange,
with a fine-tuning of the chemical composition and therefore of their
photoluminescence properties.18−24 In principle, these perovskite NCs may find applications in light
emitting devices and as labeling agents, provided that issues with
stability and toxicity are solved, whereas applications in solar cells
in general require organic-free perovskite films in order to achieve
electrical conductivity.25,26 Recent reports nonetheless
suggest that even for bulk perovskite films the incorporation of organic
molecules can help cross-linking the crystal grains and hence enhance
film stability.27,28

The reactivity of halide
perovskites (both as bulk films and as
NCs) toward agents such as air/moisture, their rapid dissolution in
aqueous solutions, and the change in their optical properties in the
presence of external halogen species (due to fast anion exchange)
severely limit both their applications and the study of their properties
under conditions that would degrade them. Colloidally synthesized
NCs come equipped with a ligand shell of organic surfactants that,
if properly transformed by irradiation by electrons or by X-rays from
a synchrotron light source (as we demonstrated recently),29 can potentially represent an effective barrier
toward degradation by a diverse range of agents. We demonstrate here
that irradiation by a low flux of X-rays (1011 photons/mm2·s), which can be easily provided by a common laboratory
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer source, can also induce a change
in the hybridization state of carbon (sp3 to sp2) of the ligand shell in films of halide perovskite NCs deposited
on a substrate, with the formation of intermolecular C=C bonding
between adjacent ligands (see Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Irradiation-Induced
Graphitization
Process
Perovskite NCs (green cubes)
deposited on a silicon substrate are capped with oleylamine (red dot
= NH2) and oleic acid (red dot = COOH) ligands. Intermolecular
C=C bonding appears as a consequence of irradiation, linking
adjacent NCs in the film.

This enhances the
film stability in several manners. First, such
“graphitization” creates a network of NCs interconnected
with each other and renders the exposed regions insoluble in solvents
that are able to disperse the starting “as synthesized”
NCs. It is therefore easy to “lift-off” the nonexposed
regions, as they remain soluble, such that luminescent patterns extending
over millimetric areas can be fabricated easily. Second, the irradiated
regions become refractory to anion exchange reactions when exposed
to either liquid or gaseous halide precursors, whereas the nonirradiated
regions exchange rapidly the anions, as reported by various groups
(including ours).18−21 This makes it possible to “draw” regions of CsPbIxBryClz with varying x, y, and z stoichiometries starting from a single CsPbX3 film, which may be exploited to elicit broadband photoluminescence
from a suitably patterned film. Furthermore, the irradiated regions
exhibit good resistance toward aging in air, water and even in a biological
buffer (phosphate buffer saline, PBS 1×). Such stability is currently
one of the most sought-after aspects concerning these materials.25,30−33

Results and Discussion
In the present work, cesium lead
halide NCs, synthesized as previously
described18 (procedure adapted from Protesescu
et al.),17 were deposited on a silicon
substrate either by drop-casting or spin-coating and were then inserted
in a X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, where they were irradiated
with X-rays from the monochromatic Al Kα source of the spectrometer
(photon energy = 1486.6 eV). At the same time, we monitored the chemical
changes in the ligand shell that took place while irradiating the
film by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). As can be seen from Figure 1a, upon irradiation over several hours (up to 2 days),
the C 1s peak shifted to lower binding energies (BE) and broadened,
while the so-called D-parameter,34 which is extracted from the derivative curve of the C KLL
peak, increased to 16.4 eV from 12.3 eV of the starting, nonirradiated
film (Figure 1b). This
parameter is sensible to the sp2/sp3 carbon
hybridization ratio, with higher values of the D-parameter
corresponding to a higher fraction of sp2 carbon.34 According to published calibration curves,34 this change corresponds to the transformation
from roughly all-sp3 hybridization (consistent with a layer
of oleylamine/oleic acid molecules capping the pristine particles)
to a 50% sp2 hybridization. This partial graphitization
can be assigned to the loss of hydrogen and the formation of intra-
and intermolecular C=C bonds, induced by X-ray irradiation
(see Scheme 1 for a
schematic view of the graphitization process). It is reasonable to
think that the electrons generated by the interaction of the primary
X-ray beam with the sample are causing the transformation rather than
(or in combination with) the X-rays themselves. Indeed, primary and
secondary electrons have already been reported to induce transformations
in thin organic self-assembled monolayers.35,36 Furthermore, we observed a similar effect upon exposure to electron
beams on these NCs (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) as well as on NCs of other inorganic materials
but coated with the same ligand shell as the one studied here.29

and irradiated
CsPbBr3 NC films. C 1s (a) and first derivative of C KLL
(b) XPS spectra corroborating the partial transformation from sp3 to sp2 hybridization state of carbon. These changes
can be ascribed to the breaking of C–H bonds and formation
of C=C bonds, with consequent cross-linking of the ligands
at the surface of the NCs. Wide XPS scans (c; see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for a more complete assignment
of XPS peaks) and XRD patterns (d) show that the chemical composition
and the crystallinity of the particles are maintained.

Partial ligand transformation was observed already
after 30 min
of irradiation with a 2.4 × 1011 photons/mm2·s X-ray flux. Therefore, in the experiments that follow, typical
irradiation times were between 30 min and 5 h. It must be noted that,
since the X-ray intensity profile on the sample has a Gaussian distribution,37 the area affected by the irradiation becomes
larger with increasing irradiation time, as regions far from the spot
center (>1–2 mm) may receive a high enough dose even at
low
flux. This range of irradiation times proved enough for the stabilization
of the film. At the same time, X-ray irradiation under vacuum did
not lead to noticeable changes in the chemical composition of the
film (see Figure 1c)
or in the crystalline structure of the particles’ cores, as
demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, see Figure 1d). Also, irradiation with X-rays under the
higher vacuum conditions of the XPS setup does not lead to the deposition
of any additional carbon layer, which may be the case when the irradiation
is performed with electron beam lithography. Interestingly, the regions
of the NCs films irradiated by X-rays became insoluble in toluene,
while the nonexposed regions could be easily lifted-off from the substrate
in a process similar to that presented by Nandwana et al.38 and by others.39−41 We used this property
to demonstrate large-scale patterning of a CsPbBr3 NCs
film. A 3 mm copper grid with a honeycomb network of 150 μm
hexagonal apertures was used as stencil mask during the irradiation
of the film. The mask was then removed and the whole film was rinsed
in toluene (see Figure 2a for a schematic representation of the process). Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), confocal photoluminescence (PL) imaging, and XPS
chemical mapping of the bromine 3d peak corroborated the selective
etching of the film only at the nonirradiated regions between the
hexagons (see Figure 2b–d). Similar results could be obtained with an e-beam (see Figure S1), although for the reasons mentioned
above e-beam lithography was not investigated further in this work.

Figure 2 (a) Schematic

NC film patterning (see Scheme 1 for additional details). The stencil mask is a 3 mm honeycomb
copper grid. Confocal PL microscopy (b; 515 nm emission), SEM (c),
and XPS (d; Br 3d intensity mapping at BE = 68 eV) demonstrating selective
stabilization of the CsPbBr3 NCs in the exposed regions
corresponding to the hexagonal apertures of the stencil mask. Scale
bars are 300 μm.

The dose of X-ray irradiation on the NC films regulated the
extent
to which the films could engage in anion exchange reactions. As an
example, a “mild” dose (i.e., 30 min at 1011 photons/mm2·s) was enough to modify the ligand shell
so that the irradiated regions could not be dissolved by dipping the
whole sample in toluene, while at the same time the ligand shell remained
permeable enough to enable anion exchange. Higher doses (achieved
by a few hours exposure at same photon flux) could then block the
exchange. Starting from a CsPbBr3 NC film, using a long
masked irradiation followed by a short “flood” (maskless)
exposure of the whole film and then by immersion of the sample in
a iodine precursor (I-OLAM) solution in toluene,18 we could fabricate patterns of bromide-rich (unexchanged)
and iodide-rich (exchanged) regions, as shown in Figure 3a,b. This methodology has two
drawbacks: it requires two irradiation steps (masked and unmasked),
which makes the process elaborate, and additionally the flood irradiation
can cause some undesired anion exchange inhibition.

of iodine (orange) and bromine (green) (b) on a CsPbBr3/CsPbI3 NC patterned film, prepared from an initial CsPbBr3 NC film by a sequence of two irradiation sessions (masked
irradiation at high dose to inhibit anion-exchange on selected regions
followed by unmasked irradiation at low dose to prevent dissolution
of the film in toluene). The hexagonal areas remained indeed Br rich,
while the stripe regions between the hexagons became I rich. (c, d)
PL microscopy images recorded by integrating in a wavelength range
from 500 to 600 nm (c) and from 410 to 500 nm (d) on a patterned CsPbBr3/CsPbCl3 NC film by single masked irradiation and
followed by anion-exchange (Br → Cl) using HCl vapors as source
of Cl– ions. PL microscopy image (e) and emission
spectra of different regions of interest (f) on a film of CsPbI3 NCs after having undergone sequential irradiations and anion-exchange
with HBr and HCl. Due to the deposition technique (drop-casting) the
film had high roughness. Since the image was acquired with a confocal
microscope, the appearance of dark spots on the image is due to out-of-focus
regions that were cut-out by the pinhole setup. Scale bars are 300
μm.

In order to circumvent these issues,
we carried out anion exchange
by exposing the NC films to hydrohalic vapors, as this procedure avoids
the intermediate unmasked irradiation step. Films of CsPbBr3 could be converted to CsPbCl3 and then converted back
to their original composition simply by placing the film a few mm
above a vial of HCl or HBr for less than a minute (see Figure S2 and Video). Thus, as the stability of the film was no more an issue in this
case, we could easily fabricate patterns of different compositions
after a single masked irradiation, followed by anion exchange with
gaseous reagents (see Figure 3c, d). Eventually, starting from a red-emitting CsPbI3 film it was also possible to obtain a gradient of different
colors after subsequent irradiations and anion-exchanges with HBr
and HCl, resulting in a film with broadband photoluminescence between
500 and 700 nm (see Figure 3e, f). In this case, no stencil mask was applied. However,
as the X-ray spot on the surface has an uneven intensity distribution,
a “gradient of anion-exchange inhibition” could be obtained
from a single exposure (see Figure S3 for
more details on the dose-dependent anion exchange inhibition from
a single irradiation).

It must be noted that long exposures
to X-rays (5 h with a flux
of 2.4 × 1011 photons/mm2·s in case
of the sample shown in Figure 4) could lead to a loss of photoluminescence on the central
region of the irradiated spot (maximum dose). This deleterious effect
does not appear to be related to any specific lability of halide perovskites,
since we observed the same behavior on giant shell CdSe/CdS NCs,42 which are systems that have a documented photostability
(see Figure S4). Furthermore, we could
not detect any changes in chemical composition, crystallinity (Figures 1 and S5) or film morphology (Figures S5 and S6) in the regions that suffered such loss in photoluminescence.
Therefore, we can only speculate that the prolonged exposure to “high”
X-ray flux is likely inducing the formation of trap states which lead
to nonradiative recombination. On the other hand, it is clear that
at lower doses (which is the case either for regions further away
from the center of irradiation, see Figure 4; or for samples at shorter irradiation times,
see Figures S4 and S7) the photoluminescence
was preserved. From a practical point of view, it is plausible that
a less-focused X-ray source could lead to a more homogeneous stabilization
(i.e., prevention from redispersion or anion-exchange,
while conserving the photoluminescence properties) over larger areas.

While recent reports have stressed the instability of lead triiodide
perovskites, especially toward moisture,25,30−32 we demonstrate here that the same sample of irradiated
NCs remained stable after several weeks in air (room temperature,
ambient humidity), then after 1 day in ultrapure Milli-Q water and
then finally after 3 days in a biological buffer (PBS 1×). This
is in striking contrast to the rapid degradation of the same crystals
deposited on the same conditions, but not irradiated (or irradiated
at lower dose, see Figure 4). At the end of the aging procedure, the irradiated sample
was rinsed with ultrapure water to remove deposited salts from the
PBS solution and the PL spectrum was recorded (see Figure S7): the emission peak from this sample was still at
around 670 nm, consistent with the spectral position of the pristine
CsPbI3 NC sample.

Figure 4 Photographs of CsPbI3 NC films (ca.
5 × 5 mm2) under UV lamp. Films irradiated at low
dose (1 h or less)
are completely degraded after 5 days exposure to air (room temperature
and ambient humidity) and were therefore not immersed in water or
biological buffer. Instead, the sample irradiated for 5 h retains
its PL properties in air, water and PBS 1×.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated how low flux X-ray irradiation
can greatly
enhance the stability of cesium lead halide NC films by inducing the
formation of C=C bonds between the organic ligands present
at the NC surfaces. This enhanced stability can be useful for a number
of applications. It was shown that PL patterns of one or several colors
could be easily obtained either by redispersion of nonirradiated areas
or by selective anion-exchange using either liquid or gaseous reagents.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that irradiated cesium lead triiodide
films could be remarkably protected from degradation when exposed
to air, moisture, pure water, and even biologic buffers. This stability
is especially promising for further exploitation of these NCs to different
fields, including applications in aqueous environments. Although these
films may not be suitable as such for applications where electrical
conductivity is needed (due to their high organic content), great
promise is coming from hybrid approaches incorporating organic molecules
to organic-free films.27,28 X-ray induced stabilization could
also play a key role in the development of these approaches.

Methods
Materials
Lead(II)
bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%
trace metals basis), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999% trace
metals basis), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, reagentPlus,
99%), iodine (I2, 99.99%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, ACS
reagent, ≥37%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt % in H2O), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt % in H2O, ≥ 99.99%), octadecene
(ODE, technical grade, 90%), oleylamine (OLAM, 70%), and oleic acid
(OA, 90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Toluene (TOL, anhydrous,
99.8%) was bought from Carlo Erba reagents. All chemicals were used
without any further purification, except for OLAM, OA, and ODE, which
were degassed at 100 °C for 2 h in vacuum.

CsPbX3 Nanocrystals and OLAM-I Synthesis
CsPbBr3 and
CsPbI3 NCs were synthesized as
described by Protesescu et al.,17 with
some minor adaptations. In a typical synthesis, 69 mg of PbBr2 (0.188 mmol) or 87 mg of PbI2, 5 of mL ODE, 0.5
mL of OA, and 0.5 mL of OLAM were loaded in a 25 mL three-neck flask
and dried under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C. After degassing, the
temperature was raised to 165 °C and a 0.6 mL ODE with 0.4 mL
of previously synthesized Cs-oleate (0.4 g Cs2CO3 degassed in 15 mL ODE and 1.75 mL OA at 150 °C) mixture was
swiftly injected. Immediately after the injection, the NC solution
was quickly cooled down to room temperature with an ice bath, and
the NCs were transferred to a glovebox. The OLAM-I precursor was prepared
by reacting 0.5 mmol of I2 (1 mmol I–) with 0.250 mL OLAM overnight. The solid OLAM-I was dissolved in
5.75 mL TOL.

Film Deposition
Nanocrystals were
deposited either
by spin-coating or drop-casting onto piranha-cleaned silicon wafers.
Typically, 1 mL of CsPbX3 solution in ODE was centrifuged
for 10 min at 14 000 rpm, the supernatant was removed, and
the particles were redispersed in 100 μL of toluene. For spin-coating,
20 μL of solution was dropped on the substrate which was then
spinned at 2500 rpm for 40 s.

X-ray Irradiation
Nanocrystal films were irradiated
in vacuum with the Al Kα monochromatic source of the X-ray Photoelectron
Spectrometer (photon energy = 1486.6 eV) with an emission current
of 10 mA or 20 mA, corresponding to photon fluxes of 1.2 × 1011 photons/mm2·s or 2.4 × 1011 photons/mm2·s.

E-beam Lithography
CsPbBr3 nanocrystal films
were irradiated by an electron beam from a Raith 150-two lithography
system with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and exposure dose of
1 mC/cm2.

Anion-Exchange
Br → I anion-exchange
was performed
in toluene by immersing the sample film in a 0.17 M solution of OLAM-I
precursor for 5 min, followed by rinsing with fresh toluene and drying
under a stream of nitrogen. Br ↔ Cl, I → Br, and I →
Br → Cl exchanges were performed from the gas phase simply
by holding the sample (film) a few mm on top of a vial of hydrobromic
or hydrochloric acid for ca. 30 s.

XPS Characterization
XPS characterization was performed
using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with a monochromatic Al
Kα source (15 kV, 20 mA). Wide scans were acquired at an analyzer
pass energy of 160 eV. High resolution narrow scans were performed
at a pass energy of 20 eV and steps of 0.1 eV. The photoelectrons
were detected at a takeoff angle Φ = 0° with respect to
the surface normal. The pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained
below 5 × 10–9 Torr for data acquisition. The
data were converted to VAMAS format and processed using CasaXPS software.
For the monitoring of the carbon graphitization, films were deposited
on a gold substrate and the binding energy scale was referenced to
the Au 4f7/2 peak (BE = 84.0 eV).

SEM Characterization
SEM images were recorded using
a JEOL JSM- 7500F (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) instrument equipped with a
cold field emission gun (FEG), operating at 10 kV acceleration voltage.

PL Microscopy
Confocal PL microscopy images and spectra
were recorded with a Nikon A1 microscope with a laser excitation of
405 or 488 nm.

XRD
XRD analysis was performed on
a PANalytical Empyrean
X-ray diffractometer equipped with a 1.8 kW Cu Kα ceramic X-ray
tube and PIXcel3D 2 × 2 area detector, and operating
at 45 kV and 40 mA. The diffraction patterns were collected in air
at room temperature using parallel-beam (PB) geometry and symmetric
reflection mode. XRD data analysis was carried out using HighScore
4.1 software from PANalytical
