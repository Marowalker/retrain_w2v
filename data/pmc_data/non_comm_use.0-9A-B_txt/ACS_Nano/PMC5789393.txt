We
report the energy level alignment evolution of valence and conduction
bands of armchair-oriented graphene nanoribbons (aGNR) as their band
gap shrinks with increasing width. We use 4,4″-dibromo-para-terphenyl as the molecular precursor on Au(111) to
form extended poly-para-phenylene nanowires, which
can subsequently be fused sideways to form atomically precise aGNRs
of varying widths. We measure the frontier bands by means of scanning
tunneling spectroscopy, corroborating that the nanoribbon’s
band gap is inversely proportional to their width. Interestingly,
valence bands are found to show Fermi level pinning as the band gap
decreases below a threshold value around 1.7 eV. Such behavior is
of critical importance to understand the properties of potential contacts
in GNR-based devices. Our measurements further reveal a particularly
interesting system for studying Fermi level pinning by modifying an
adsorbate’s band gap while maintaining an almost unchanged
interface chemistry defined by substrate and adsorbate.

Graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs)
have long been proposed as extremely interesting materials for a variety
of applications, ranging from their key role in composites with mechanically
robust films and high gas barrier efficiencies1 to thermoelectric devices,2,3 capacitors,4,5 batteries,6 photodetectors,7 transistors,8 or directly
integrated circuits.9 Among the most appealing
attributes that make GNRs so interesting, we find the greatly tunable
properties they display as a function of their precise atomic structure.
While this holds enormous interest for many of the applications mentioned
above, it also underlines the need for atomic precision in their synthesis
if the full potential of GNRs is to be exploited. That was achieved
for the first time in 2010 with the bottom-up synthesis of armchair-oriented
nanoribbons (aGNRs) with 7 dimer lines across their width (7-aGNR).10 Ever since, following a similar “on-surface
synthesis” approach, great efforts are being devoted to the
synthesis of GNRs with different widths,11−13 edge orientations,14,15 dopants,16−20 as well as heterostructures thereof.21−24

The increasing pool of
available GNRs with well-defined structures
has allowed the subsequent characterization of their fundamental electronic
properties, as well as the correlation with their performance when
integrated into devices like field effect transistors.25,26 Interestingly, it has been found that the device performance is
strongly dominated by contact effects, in particular, by the Schottky
barrier at the GNR–contact interface. As opposed to studies
of other GNR properties like their band gaps, systematic studies of
the energy level alignment between GNRs and common contact materials
are still missing in spite of their determining role in the ultimate
response of GNR-based devices. In this work, we amend our understanding
of such interface energetics between GNRs and gold, in particular,
Au(111) surfaces.

Armchair-oriented nanoribbons are known to
display a width-dependent
band gap. Calculations reveal that they can be classified into three
different subfamilies depending on the number of dimer lines p across their width (3p, 3p+1, or 3p + 2), their band gaps being inversely proportional
to the width within each of those families.27−29 The reported
band gap values of the various aGNRs synthesized to date confirm this
picture with scattered points along the predictions for each of the
GNR families.29,30 In this work, we provide a systematic
study of the band gap and energy level alignment of GNRs focused on
the 3p family, addressing from the smallest possible
GNR (3-aGNR) to its four immediately following sister structures (6-,
9-, 12-, and 15-aGNRs). Starting from the synthesis of poly-para-phenylene wires (PPP or 3-aGNR) on Au(111), subsequent
annealing drives their lateral fusion and results in the required
atomically precise GNRs of varying width.31 The following characterization by scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals, in
addition to the width-dependent band gap, the onset of Fermi level
pinning for widths ≥6 dimer lines.

Results and Discussion
We use 4,4″-dibromo-p-terphenyl (DBTP)
as a molecular precursor to synthesize the structures described in
this work. Figure 1 summarizes the stepwise synthesis of aGNRs starting from the precursor.
A submonolayer of DBTP is initially deposited on a Au(111) single
crystal held at room temperature. After postdeposition annealing above
250 °C, the precursor undergoes Ullmann-like coupling,31,32 yielding poly-para-phenylene (PPP) nanowires. Figure 1b shows a scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) image of a representative sample. As previously
reported,31 these nanowires are highly
aligned, separated by arrays of bromine atoms between them (see Figure S1a), and present impressive lengths of
up to 200 nm. PPP has been occasionally termed as a 3-aGNR and would
thus fit into a family of 3p-aGNRs. However, as previously
concluded from near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)
measurements, it displays a nonplanar structure on Au.20 While not recognizable in constant current (“topographic”)
STM imaging (Figure 1b), mapping of the density of states (DOS) at the onset of valence
band (VB) and conduction band (CB) clearly reveals a modulated intensity
that mirrors an alternating tilt of subsequent phenyl rings (Figure S1). The nonplanarity of gold-supported
PPP is also confirmed by DFT calculations even when using functionals
that incorporate the vdW interaction, although reduced with respect
to that in gas-phase PPP. As discussed later, this nonplanar structure
leads to a substantial difference in the electronic properties of
the polymer with respect to the rest of the wider (and planar) 3p-aGNRs.

1.0 V) and (c) a-GNRs (24.6 nm × 24,6 nm, It = 0.22 nA, Vs = −1.7 V),
where text inlets indicate the different widths of aGNRs.

Above 430 °C, PPP nanowires merge sideways
through dehydrogenation,31 forming aGNRs
of different width, as shown in Figure 1c. This synthetic
step relies on random diffusion effects imposed by the high temperature
and results in an interconnected network of nanoribbons of different
widths. There is a significant number of curved aGNRs, but most of
them preserve the preceding nanowire’s straight orientation.
The final nanoribbon width depends on the number of nanowires getting
fused. Discretized by the intrinsic width of PPP nanowires (3-aGNR),
we find 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-aGNRs are formed from the fusion of two,
three, four, and five nanowires, respectively. Having them all next
to each other on the same Au(111) surface reveals itself as an excellent
testbed to measure and compare their respective electronic properties.

The aGNR’s electronic properties have been characterized
by STS, measuring both differential conductance (dI/dV) point spectra and dI/dV maps at various sample bias voltages (Figure 2). The point spectra were taken
over the sides (where the measured GNR signal is highest22,33,34) of straight GNR segments, featuring
a well-defined width and defect-free structure over substantial lengths.
While segments of 6- and 9-aGNRs easily exceed tens of nanometers,
the wider the ribbons, the shorter the average segments are. To avoid
notable band gap variations from finite length effects, spectra are
only taken into account from segments longer than 4 nm (i.e. ∼9 unit cells). While the convergence behavior of the GNR
band gap with its length depends on a series of aspects such as the
ribbon’s own polarizability and thus on its particular structure,
for the GNRs studied here, the probed electronic properties at these
lengths can be considered to be close to those of an infinite ribbon.35,36Figure 2a displays
representative STS spectra for ribbons with different widths, together
with background spectra of the bare Au(111) surface nearby, as a reference.

1.4–10 nA; modulation voltage Vrms = 10 mV). (b) STM topography image (12.4 nm × 12.4 nm; Vs = −1.1 V; It = 0.61 nA). (c) Conductance map near the valence band onset (Vs = −0.25 V), with white arrows as a
guide for the eye to the intensity along each aGNR edge. (d) Profiles
across the conductance map in (c), highlighting the contribution from
the VB of differently wide GNRs on top of the dominating Au(111) surface
state contribution. Conductance maps near the conduction band onsets
for (e) 15-aGNRs and 12-aGNRs (Vs = 0.95
V), (f) 9-aGNR (Vs = 1.15 V), and (g)
6-aGNR (Vs = 1.55 V). The displayed spectra
have been taken from ribbons on different sample locations (not necessarily
on those of panels b–g). Differences in the reference spectra
relate to different tips and positions. The comparable intensity in
12- and 15-aGNRs’ edges in image (d) probably relates to the
limited length of the 15-aGNR segment. Its reduced length causes an
increased band gap and thus leads to an upshift in the energy of the
conduction band onset, making it overlap with that of the longer 12-aGNR.
Size and set point for all conductance images were 12.4 nm ×
12.4 nm and It = 0.61 nA, respectively.

All STS spectra show a clear conductance
rise at positive bias,
which is attributed to the onset of the conduction band. The position
of these bands is observed at different energies as a function of
the ribbons’ width: the wider the ribbon, the closer to EF its conduction band is. In this way, the onsets
range from 0.86 eV, for the wider 15-aGNR, to 1.47 eV for the narrower
6-aGNR. Regarding the filled states (Vs < 0), the first nanoribbon-related feature in the spectra is
detected at bias values close to −0.2 eV for all measured widths.
We associate it with the corresponding onset of the aGNR valence band.
A more detailed analysis reveals that the valence band onset follows
a similar, although less pronounced, width-related trend as the one
observed in the conduction band case. The valence bands are slightly
closer to EF as the GNRs become wider,
ranging from −0.17 to −0.23 eV. It is worth noting that
the detection of the VB onset is particularly difficult on Au(111)
since the surface state signal overlaps with the 3p-AGNRs spectroscopic features. Additionally, the density of states
of the valence band of 3p-AGNRs decays particularly
fast along the direction perpendicular to the GNR plane.12,34 Both of these reasons severely complicate its detection by STS.
Nevertheless, our analysis of both valence and conduction bands is
in excellent agreement with the recently reported electronic structure
and energy level alignment of 9-aGNRs synthesized selectively on Au(111)
from appropriate precursors.12

The
conclusions derived above from our dI/dV point spectra are supported by dI/dV maps obtained at different biases (Figure 2c–g). When probing the empty states
(Vs > 0), as one increases the energy,
only the oscillations associated with scattered surface state electrons
are initially visible (Figure S2). However,
there is an energy threshold at which an increased conductance starts
becoming visible along the sides of the ribbons, first for the wider
ribbons (Figure 2e)
and as the energy increases also for 9-aGNRs (Figure 2f) and 6-aGNRs (Figure 2g). Such intensity in conductance maps is
related to the local density of states (LDOS) of aGNR bands,11,34 and the threshold energies at which the increased conductance sets
in are in agreement with the width-dependent band onsets determined
from the point spectra. In the case of the filled states (Vs < 0), conductance maps at −0.25
V reveal the strong intensity of the scattered surface state. Superimposed
to it, we observe a weak but recognizable intensity distributed along
the edges of every nanoribbon (Figure 2c) further highlighted in the profiles displayed in Figure 2d and Figure S2. This agrees with the VB onsets being
at similar energies for all GNRs, as observed in the spectra (Figure 2a). Besides the frontier
bands, our spectroscopy measurements reveal an additional nanoribbon-related
signal at higher negative bias (Figure S3). We associate it with the second valence band (VB-1), which is
easier to be probed by the tip of the STM than is the VB. Its slower
decay away from the nanoribbon plane explains,12,34 together with the absence of the Au(111) surface state at these
energies, its stronger and more easily measurable signal (Figure S3). For a clear visualization of the
overall data, Table 1 summarizes the energies of all band onsets averaged over several
measurements on different aGNRs, as well as the associated band gaps.

The average band gaps obtained for the differently wide aGNRs are
displayed in Figure 3, where PPP nanowires (analyzed in Figure S1) are included for comparison as 3-aGNRs. The values fit into the
predicted range for gold-supported nanoribbons of similar widths,29 and their smooth evolution is also in line with
predictions.27,29 However, 3-aGNRs clearly stick
out of the smoothly varying trend of a monotonously decreasing band
gap with incremental width within the 3p-aGNR family.
The reason behind this is that, in addition to the larger band gap
associated with its narrower width, it is the only nonplanar structure.
As a result, the degree of conjugation is reduced,37 causing an anomalous band gap increase for this particular
structure different from the wider graphene nanoribbons. Figure 3 also displays the
average onset energies of valence and conduction band for the differently
wide aGNRs. It becomes immediately clear that GNRs display an overall
p-type alignment on Au(111) and that for 6- and wider aGNRs, as the
band gap decreases, the conductance band onset approaches the Fermi
level much faster than the valence band.

Figure 3 Average spectroscopic
results for valence and conduction bands
(black lines, left scale) and the resulting band gaps (blue line,
right scale).

Both of these effects
are indeed reproduced by DFT calculations
of Au(111)-supported graphene nanoribbons from 3 (PPP wires) to 12
dimer lines. Figure 4 displays the band structure of the various systems, where the diameter
of blue symbols is proportional to the weight of each state on the
carbon atoms and thus on the GNRs. Next to the band structures, the
figure displays the density of states projected onto C. The ribbons
show a clear p-type alignment with the Au(111) substrate. In line
with our experiment-based observations, after a notable upshift of
the valence band from 3-aGNR to 6-aGNR, for wider ribbons, the band
onset appears close to the Fermi energy at a position fairly independent
of the ribbon width. It shifts by only ∼0.16 eV when going
from 6-aGNRs to 12-aGNRs, to be compared with an about 3 times larger
shift of the conduction band for the same widths.

circles denotes the density of states projected onto the GNR’s
carbon atoms. The shadowed areas indicate the respective band gaps.

Experimentally, the p-type alignment
of GNRs seems reasonable due
to the p-type doping observed for gold-supported graphene,38−42 which stems from the much larger work function of gold as compared
to that of graphene. However, calculations have shown the understanding
of this alignment not to be trivial as it depends on the dipole layer
formed at the metal–graphene interface and displays a marked
dependence on the details of the graphene–substrate interaction
and the associated adsorption distance.43−45 GNRs have a weak interaction
with the Au(111) surface, dominated by van der Waals forces. As a
weakly interacting semiconducting adsorbate approaches a metal surface,
the substrate’s intrinsic surface dipole is modified by an
amount Δ as a result of a variety of processes that include,
among others, the surface’s electron cloud redistribution arising
from Pauli repulsion with the adsorbate (commonly termed as “pillow
effect”) or intrinsic adsorbate’s dipole moments.46 In the case of aGNRs on Au(111), only the former
process is relevant, giving rise to an effective reduction of the
substrate work function. Indeed, for extended graphene on Au(111),
the effect is such that, although at the equilibrium adsorption height
(∼3.3 Å) p-doping is predicted by first-principles calculations,
for only slightly smaller distances (<3.2 Å), n-doping is
obtained instead.43,44 Therefore, the strong p-type
alignment observed here for the aGNRs is not necessarily obvious.
Particularly intriguing is the observation, in agreement with experiment,
of very asymmetric shifts of the VB and CB onsets in the DFT calculations.
Although the VB approaches the Fermi level as the GNRs become wider,
in our calculations, it remains below the Fermi level without indications
of a partial charge transfer to the substrate. In the absence of charge
transfer, one would expect a rather symmetric closing of the gap.
Thus, the observed behavior requires a width-dependent alignment of
the aGNR levels with respect to those of Au(111). At this point, it
is worth noting that the dependence of the ribbon’s polarizability
on its width has been recently proposed as instrumental to understand
the width dependence of the band gap of adsorbed GNRs.29 However, in contrast to our experimental observations,
this effect should affect both the VB and CB in a comparable way.

Figures S4 and S5 show the relaxed geometry
and the distribution of the induced charge upon adsorption of the
6-aGNR on Au(111), respectively. The computed equilibrium adsorption
height of the central portion of the ribbon is in the range of 3.23–3.34
Å (larger for wider ribbons). The limit for extended graphene
is 3.34 Å, in good agreement with previous calculations.43Figure S4 shows how
the electron charge accumulated in the surface as a result of the
“pillow effect” extends beyond the region covered by
carbon, piling up along the edges. This is most probably favored by
the positive partial charge on the hydrogen atoms along the GNR edges.
Thus, we find that the charge distribution is noticeably affected
by the finite width of the ribbons. This characteristic distribution
of the induced charge produces a width-dependent decrease of the interface
dipole Δ, favoring a stronger p-type alignment the narrower
is the GNR. This effect partially compensates the downshift of the
VB as the GNRs become narrower while increases the upshift of the
CB. Therefore, it can explain the asymmetric level movement observed
in the DFT calculations and, as a consequence, be a key ingredient
to understand also our experimental results. However, this effect
smoothly scales inversely proportional to the GNR width, while the
experiment evidences a relatively sharp transition from a rapidly
varying valence band alignment at widths below 6-aGNRs to an almost
unchanged valence band as the width increases (see Figure 3). In fact, as will be shown
below, the transition seems to relate directly to the GNR’s
band gap, which is no longer inversely proportional to the width if
different families of armchair GNRs or even differently oriented GNRs
are considered. Thus, in addition to the width-dependent interface
dipole, additional band-gap-dependent effects must be responsible
for our observations.

A sharp transition from having a varying
onset energy in frontier
band’s to having them quasi-unchanged (close to the Fermi energy)
is typically termed as Fermi level pinning. It is a well-known phenomenon
observed at metal–semiconductor interfaces when one of the
semiconductor’s bands gets close in energy to the substrate’s
Fermi level, typically due to particularly high or low work functions
(Figure S6a). Observing a transition from
a non-Fermi level pinning behavior to the pinning usually requires
the work function to be changed and thereby the interface chemistry.
Instead, in this particular study on Fermi level pinning, the same
phenomenology is observed while keeping the interface chemistry almost
unchanged, the only varying parameter being the GNR’s width
and thus its associated band gap (Figure S6b).

The typically proposed explanation for Fermi level pinning
is as
follows. In the current case of an unchanged substrate and a decreasing
adsorbate’s band gap, valence and conduction band onsets plotted vs the band gap would be expected to symmetrically approach
the midgap value with a slope S = 0.5 (Figure 5a). However, as one of the
bands (e.g., valence band in Figure 5a) gets close to the Fermi level, further
band gap reductions create a compensating dipole moment σ to
refrain the band from crossing the Fermi level. Although not confirmed
by our calculations, whether due to the inability of current semilocal
functionals to describe the energies of the electronic levels with
sufficient accuracy for the free-standing ribbons and adequately incorporate
correlation effects upon adsorption, or to slight deviations in the
calculated adsorption distances that can substantially alter the interface
energetics,43 this is typically assumed
to occur through partial charge transfer into metal-induced gap states.47−49 As a result, the nonpinned band (conduction band in Figure 5a) now supports a shift equal
to the full band gap decrease (S = 1), while the
alignment of the pinned band remains unchanged (S = 0). To prevent the semiconductors’ bands from crossing
the Fermi level, the interfacial charge transfer is reduced. It is
therefore commonly observed with physisorbed materials because its
absence would imply substantial charge transfers and consequently
a chemisorption scenario.50 This is exactly
what we could expect from the interaction of graphene nanoribbons
with an inert surface like Au(111).

Figure 5 (a) Schematic evolution of the energy
level alignment of valence
and conduction band for varying adsorbate band gap. The energy level
diagrams depict the interface dipole Δ from the molecular adsorption,
as well as the additional dipole σ responsible for Fermi level
pinning as the band gap gets narrower and one of the bands approaches
the Fermi level (the valence band in this figure). It also displays
the changing slopes of valence and conduction band onset vs band gap as Fermi level pinning sets in. (b) Valence and conduction
band onsets of GNRs studied in this work and in other reports of Au(111)-supported
ribbons vs their respective band gap (width given
by numbers next to the CB symbols). Linear fits in selected regions
display the changes in slope, evidencing notable similarity with the
model scenario of panel (a).

Indeed, we observe a striking agreement between the model
Fermi
level pinning behavior of band onset vs band gap
(Figure 5a) and the
experimentally observed values from this work, together with results
from other Au(111)-supported GNRs reported elsewhere, like 13-aGNR,11 9-aGNRS,12 7-aGNR,33,34 5-aGNRs,51 and even (3,1) chiral GNRs52 (Figure 5b). As displayed in Figure 4b, for band gaps above the critical value of ∼1.7
eV, valence and conduction bands shift symmetrically around their
midgap value with a slope close to S = 0.5. However,
as the band gap gets below that threshold value, the valence band
remains almost constant (S = −0.08 ±
0.05) while the conduction band supports almost the full band decrease
by shifting with a slope of S = 0.92 ± 0.05.
Several GNRs have been characterized previously on an even less interacting
substrate, namely, on Au(111) with an intercalated Si layer. On that
substrate the GNRs display a slightly larger band gap due to the reduced
substrate screening. However, not only does the band alignment similarly
fit into our proposed Fermi level pinning picture, as expected from
such weakly interacting surface, but it actually displays strikingly
similar energies30 (Figure S7). Fermi level pinning energies of molecular adsorbates’
orbitals may vary substantially from system to system, which is normally
associated with the different density of states hosted by the frontier
orbitals and how far in energy the tails of the frontier bands’
density of states extend into the gap. In general, typical values
remain below 0.4 eV away from the Fermi level,53,54 which coincides with our observations.

Although still maintaining
the same trend of a reduced slope of
the valence band shift and an increased slope for the conduction band
shift, 5-aGNRs deviate somewhat from the tendency observed for the
rest of GNRs and even show a valence band onset slightly above the
Fermi level. This is presumably due to the small band gap of GNRs
belonging to the 3p + 2 family.51 They have correspondingly minute effective masses on their
frontier bands55 and thus a very low density
of states around the gap. As a consequence, in a similar way as observed
for graphene on a variety of substrates due to its associated low
density of states around the Dirac point,38,43 the bands of 5-aGNRs can cross the Fermi level with very little
associated charge transfer and thus without creating substantial interface
dipoles. Instead, the case of nanoribbons with sizable band gaps is
utterly different in that it exhibits a large density of states at
the van Hove singularity of the valence band onset, causing a clearer
Fermi level pinning.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report
spectroscopic evidence of the width-dependent
band gap predicted for armchair graphene nanoribbons a decade ago
and the associated energy level alignment. Starting with the synthesis
of PPP wires (3-aGNRs), subsequent annealing drives their lateral
fusion into 6-, 9-, 12-, or 15-aGNRs depending on the number of involved
PPP chains. That is, the first 5 members of 3p-aGNR
family are obtained on the same surface, on which both valence and
conduction bands are probed by means of STS. We observe a continuously
decreasing band gap as the GNRs structures get wider. Most importantly,
Fermi level pinning of the valence band is found on Au(111) for 6
or more dimer lines wide aGNRs, in qualitative agreement with DFT
calculations. Results known from other GNRs equally fit the pinning
phenomenon proposed here, whenever their bandgap is below ∼1.7
eV. This has important implications on the energy level alignment
across GNR/metal interfaces, which may in turn be crucial for future
GNR-based devices displaying similar interfaces at charge collection
electrodes.

Methods
Experimental Procedures
Samples were prepared by deposition
of precursor molecules from a Dodecon molecular evaporator containing
a Knudsen cell where the molecular precursors are placed and heated
up to a sublimation temperature of 400 K. We used a single monocrystalline
Au(111) surface as substrate. Standard sputtering/annealing cycles
(1.5 kV Ne, 730 K) were performed to obtain an atomically clean Au(111)
surface. We grew PPP nanowires and aGNRs by initial DBTP deposition
and subsequent annealing at 250 and 430 °C, respectively, in
the 10–10 mbar range. The annealing processes were
performed in such a way that the maximum temperature of 250 or 430
°C was maintained for 30 min, respectively. STM measurements
were performed using a home-built STM with the samples held at 4.2
K in UHV conditions. A tungsten tip was used for topography and spectroscopic
measurements. Topography was obtained in constant current mode of
the STM. For spectroscopic measurements, the tunneling differential
conductance was measured by a lock-in amplifier, while the sample
bias was modulated by a 767 Hz, 12–18 mV (rms) sinusoidal voltage
under open-feedback conditions.

All STM images were processed
by WSxM.56

Computational Procedures
The electronic structure and
geometries were calculated using density functional theory, as implemented
in the SIESTA code.57 We use a supercell
description of the system, made up of a slab containing 4 layers of
Au(111), with a graphene nanoribbon of 3, 6, 9, or 12 dimer lines
on the top Au surface. We employed the stacking geometry suggested
in ref (43), where

are directly matched (more details of the setup in the Supporting Information). The bottom Au surface
was passivated with hydrogen atoms to quench one of the Au(111)’s
Shockley surface states close to the Fermi level.58 In order to properly capture the “pillow effect”,
it is instrumental to describe adequately the decay of the metal electron
density into vacuum and the subsequent modifications of the surface
dipole layer upon adsorption of the ribbon. The use of a basis set
of extended, optimized atomic orbitals to describe the Au surface
atoms is thus crucial to capture the correct level alignment. To avoid
interactions between periodic surfaces, we considered a vacuum region
of more than 10 Å. The GNRs and the top two Au layers were fully
relaxed until forces were <0.01 eV/Å, and the dispersion interactions
were taken into account by the nonlocal optB88-vdW functional.59 The basis set consisted of double-ζ plus
polarization (DZP) orbitals for C, H, and bulk Au atoms. Au atoms
on the topmost layer were treated with a DZP basis set optimized for
the description of the (111) surface of Au.60 A 9 × 1 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh was used for the k-point sampling of the three-dimensional Brillouin zone,
where the 9 k-points are taken along the direction
of the ribbon. A cutoff of 300 Ry was used for the real-space grid
integrations.
