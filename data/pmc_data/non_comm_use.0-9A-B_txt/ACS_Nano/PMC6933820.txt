While DNA sequencing is now amply
available, fast, and inexpensive,
protein sequencing remains a tremendous challenge. Nanopores may allow
for developing a protein sequencer with single-molecule capabilities.
As identification of 20 different amino acids currently presents an
unsurmountable challenge, fingerprinting schemes are pursued, in which
only a subset of amino acids is labeled and detected. This requires
modification of amino acids with chemical structures that generate
a distinct nanopore ionic current signal. Here, we use a model peptide
and the fragaceatoxin C nanopore to characterize six potential tags
for a fingerprinting approach using nanopores. We find that labeled
and unlabeled proteins can be clearly distinguished and that sensitive
detection is obtained for labels with a spectrum of different physicochemical
properties such as mass (427–1275 Da), geometry, charge, and
hydrophobicity. Additionally, information about the position of the
label along the peptide chain can be obtained from individual current-blockade
event features. The results represent an important advance toward
the development of a single-molecule protein-fingerprinting device
with nanopores.

==== Body
DNA, RNA,
proteins, and metabolites
form a complex network of interactions that determines the phenotype
of cells.1,2 To obtain a broad understanding of a biological
system, we need a comprehensive approach that integrates genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.3−7 Recent technological developments have mostly focused
on the study of genomes, making DNA sequencing fast, cheap, and ubiquitous.8,9 The study of other -omics, especially proteomics, however, still
remains costly and time-consuming.10−12

One of the main
challenges in proteomics is the lack of sensitive
techniques that allow for detection of proteins present in low abundance,
because, unlike for DNA, there is no biochemical method to amplify
proteins present in a sample.13,14 Several antibody-based
methods are commonly used for protein analysis. These methods are
cost-effective; however, they have several well-known limitations.
For example, there is a limited availability of antibodies, and they
often lack the high specificity needed for complex samples. Single-molecule
techniques offer ultimate sensitivity and hold great promise for single-cell
protein analysis.15 Nanopores, in particular,
have demonstrated to be ultrasensitive biosensors,16 capable of successfully sequencing biopolymers such as
DNA.17,18 In a nanopore sensor, an insulating membrane
made of a lipid bilayer or a solid-state membrane separates two compartments
filled with an electrolyte. A nanometer-sized pore is made within
the membrane, by inserting a single protein pore into a lipid bilayer
or drilling a pore in a solid-state membrane using an electron beam.
When a voltage is applied across the membrane, an ionic current flows
through the nanometer-sized aperture. Molecules passing or translocating
through the pore modulate the ionic current, which provides the basic
sensor signal. For DNA translocation, fine changes within the current
blockade signal were found to correlate to the sequence of the DNA
passing through the pore,19,20 paving the way to DNA
sequencing at the single-molecule level.

At first glance one
might think that nanopore-based DNA sequencing
can be straightforwardly modified to also allow for protein sequencing,
but there are multiple challenges.15 While
DNA is composed of only four different bases, proteins contain over
20 different amino acids, presenting a very significant technical
hurdle for protein sequencing. In recent years, the groups of Joo
and Marcotte proposed an alternative simpler idea, namely, protein
fingerprinting, in which proteins can be identified if a subset of
amino acids is labeled and read.21,22 Joo and colleagues
proposed protein identification through detection of the sequence
of cysteines and lysines along the peptide chain, a sequence that
then is compared to a protein database for protein identification.21 Nanopores may offer an attractive technique
for the implementation of such protein fingerprinting, thanks to their
high sensitivity and time resolution. For such a nanopore protein
fingerprinting method, cysteines, lysines, or other amino acids should
be modified with labels that can produce a distinct modulation in
the current while the linearized protein traverses the nanopore. The
identification of such chemical modifications has so far not been
realized using nanopores.

Here, we study the detection of six
potential sequencing tags on
a model peptide, as measured with the fragaceatoxin C (FraC) nanopore.23,24 We attach different chemical groups to a single cysteine in the
central part of the peptide and measure their effect on the nanopore
signals. We show that labels in the range between 427 and 1275 Da
can be clearly and reproducibly detected. Information about the position
of the label can be extracted from the individual event characteristics.
The relative current blockade correlates with label properties such
as geometry and molecular weight, and the translocation time is found
to be proportional to the calculated tag charge and size. The results
represent an important advance toward the development of a single-molecule
protein-fingerprinting device with nanopores. Beyond protein fingerprinting,
the identification of single amino acid modifications is also of great
important for other biotechnology applications such as the detection
of post-translational modifications (PTMs).

Results and Discussion
Distinguishing
Labeled and Unlabeled Peptides Using the FraC
Nanopore
Nanopore protein fingerprinting requires the electrical
detection of chemical modifications on specific amino acids. We sought
to characterize the blockade levels produced by different chemical
labels in a well-defined manner. In order to avoid bandwidth-related
distortions of the signal, we designed a method to obtain long translocation
times. We used a 30 amino acid long peptide, containing 10 glutamates
at the N-terminus, and 10 arginines at the C-terminus, which at neutral pH features a strongly negatively
charged N-terminus and a strongly positively charged C-terminus. Upon applying a negative bias to the trans side of the nanopore setup (Figure 1), the peptide is dragged into the nanopore
with its positive end entering first. When the negative region subsequently
enters the pore, the electrophoretic force pulls the negatively charged
end of the peptide in the opposite direction, thus stretching the
peptide and stalling the molecule at the point where the forces in
both directions equilibrate. The “tug-of-war” created
thus allows for long observation times where the center part of the
peptide is probed in the pore constriction.25 A similar peptide was previously used by Asandei etal. to study the effect of pH in peptide–nanopore
interactions.26

Figure 1 Analysis of labeled and
unlabeled peptides with FraC. From top
to bottom: Schematic representation, typical events, and scatter plot
of relative blockade vs dwell time of the unlabeled
model peptide (a) and for the fluorescein-labeled model peptide (b)
through the FraC nanopore. (c) Scatter plot of relative blockade vs dwell time (left) and relative blockade histogram (right)
of a mixture containing labeled and unlabeled peptide. All measurements
were done using a buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM
EDTA at pH 7.5. The peptides were added to the cis compartment, and recordings were performed at a bias of −90
mV. Data were recorded at a sampling frequency of 500 kHz and further
low-pass filtered at 10 kHz. FraC is shown as a surface representation
from the PDB structure 4TSY.

Figure 1 and Figure S1 illustrate the typical nanopore experiments.
All our experiments were performed using buffer containing 1 M NaCl,
10 mM Tris, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.5. We use the wild-type type I FraC
nanopore, which most likely describes octameric nanopores,27 and the peptide described above as our substrate.
Our model peptide is added to the cis compartment
at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 μM. Negative voltages
are applied to the trans compartment for all of our
measurements to avoid gating that is observed in FraC under positive
bias. The measurements presented here are performed under a voltage
bias of −90 mV, unless stated otherwise.

Well-defined
events are consistently observed when the peptide
is present in the cis compartment (Figure 1a and Figure S1). Notably, the relative current blockade is well reproducible
from pore to pore with an average relative blockade of 0.47 ±
0.03 (error is standard deviation from N = 3 experiments)
at −90 mV, as measured in three independent experiments. The
relative blockade is defined as the ratio between the current blockade
(ΔI = IOpenPore – IBlockade) and the open pore
current (IOpenPore). Long translocation
times of 4.2 ± 0.6 ms are observed. The translocation time is
observed to decrease with increasing bias (Figure S1), indicating that the peptide exits the pore to the trans side of the chamber.28,29 A detailed
characterization of the translocation behavior of this model peptide
through the FraC nanopore can be found elsewhere.25

To probe the effect of an added chemical label to
the peptide,
we first used maleimide chemistry to label the cysteine in position
C11, i.e., near the N-terminus, with a fluorescein dye (Figure 1b). Fluorescein maleimide is a small molecule
with a molecular weight of only 427 Da. Our labeled peptides were
HPLC-purified, and the labeling was verified using MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry (Figure S2). We find that
our samples are nearly 100% labeled. We performed measurements of
the unlabeled and the fluorescein-labeled peptide, as shown in Figure 1.

We find that
the current levels from the unlabeled and labeled
peptides are clearly separated (Figure 1a,b). The unlabeled peptide produced a relative blockade
of 0.47 ± 0.01, while the labeled peptide produced a relative
blockade of 0.57 ± 0.01. These values correspond to the mean
and standard deviation derived from a Gaussian fit of the relative
blockade histograms. The clear increase in the relative blockade upon
labeling is consistent with an additional blockade by the added volume
due to the presence of the fluorescein tag. Control experiments with
a mixture of labeled and unlabeled peptides confirmed the presence
of two populations with blockade levels of 0.46 ± 0.01 and 0.56
± 0.01, very close to the values obtained from the independent
measurements (Figure 1c). We conclude that the fluorescein-labeled peptides can be readily
distinguished from their unlabeled counterpart. The difference in
the blockade levels is so clear and reproducible that, while nanopore
data typically rely on data comparison in stochastic scatter plots
of hundreds of events, we can even distinguish labeled from unlabeled
molecules one by one from their current levels in individual events
(Figure 1a,b).

Identifying
the Most Sensitive Region of the Model Peptide in
the FraC Pore
The fact that we observed events with a sizable
(>1 ms) translocation time indicates that the peptide is, as designed,
stalled in the pore at the point where the forces pulling in both
directions are equal. Our previous experiments and simulations confirmed
the mechanism of such peptide stalling in the FraC nanopore.25 During this stalling, a particular region of
the peptide will stay closest to the pore constriction at the applied
voltage of −90 mV. This portion of the peptide represents the
most sensitive sensing region of our peptide–nanopore system,
and its identification is therefore important for testing the tags
for fingerprinting. Hence, we tested three different variants of our
model peptide in which the cysteine is placed at different positions
along the central part of the peptide, namely, at position 11, 15,
or 20 as counted from the N-terminus (Figure 2). Notably, a similar approach
was used in the early days of DNA sequencing, where a DNA homopolymer
was trapped in the alpha-hemolysin nanopore, and single bases were
changed sequentially at different positions to find the region closest
to the pore constriction.19

Figure 2 Peptide labeled at different
positions through FraC. From left
to right: Schematic, current traces, and relative blockade histograms
for unlabeled peptide (a) and for fluorescein-labeled peptide at positions
C11 (b), C15 (c), and C20 (d). All labeled peptide samples were HPLC
purified and verified using mass spectrometry. Measurements were done
in a buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.5.
Peptides were added to the cis compartment and measured
at −90 mV.

The three different peptide
variants were labeled with fluorescein
maleimide, HPLC-purified, and mass spectrometry-verified as shown
in Figure S2. The three samples were measured
with the FraC nanopores, as shown in Figure 2. For reference, the relative blockade observed
for an unlabeled peptide is displayed as well in Figure 2a (derived from the scatter
plots presented in Figure 1a). The unlabeled peptide produced relative current blockades
of 0.47 ± 0.01, while we consistently observed a larger relative
blockade of 0.57 ± 0.01 for the peptide labeled with fluorescein
in position C11, as discussed in the previous section. With the peptide
labeled with fluorescein in position C15, however, pronounced current
fluctuations were observed and events often contained a lower current
level in the last fraction of the event (Figure 2c). As a consequence, a broad population
is observed in the relative blockade histogram with a mean of 0.54
and a larger standard deviation of 0.05. Finally, when the label was
placed in position C20, a blockade level of 0.48 ± 0.02 was observed, i.e., virtually no increase in the relative
blockade compared to the unlabeled peptide but merely leading to a
weak tail on the right-hand side of the histogram. Most interestingly,
while the average current level of the events corresponded to that
of the unlabeled peptide for most of the event duration, a clear spike
in the current was observed at the start of most of these events (81%)
(Figure 2d).

These results suggest that when the label is placed at position
C11, it remains in the proximity of the pore constriction during the
entire duration of the event. As a consequence, a well-defined increase
in the blockade is observed. On the other hand, when the label is
placed in position C15, fluctuations in the current level are observed,
indicating that the label occupies the pore constriction only for
a fraction of the time of the event duration. Finally when the label
is placed in position C20, it appears to be too far from the nanopore
constriction for most of the event duration, while it is only temporarily
observed at the beginning of the event as the label moves fast through
the nanopore. From examining these three positions that were tested,
we thus conclude that the label remains the closest to the nanopore
constriction when it is placed in position C11, and hence we identify
this as the most sensitive region in our model peptide in the FraC
system. The results indicate that both the relative blockade and individual
event characteristics can be used to extract information on the position
of the label in the peptide system.

Exploring Diverse Labels
Using the Peptide-FraC System
Protein fingerprinting requires
the use of multiple different chemical
tags attached to different amino acids. The development of efficient
chemical procedures to label different amino acids is still a subject
of active research in chemistry.30 Here,
we focus on maleimide chemistry due to specificity, availability of
labels, and simplicity of the reaction conditions. We proceeded to
label the peptide in position C11 with a variety of tags as shown
in Figure 3a. In ascending
order of their molecular weight, the six labels studied were fluorescein
(427 Da), Texas Red (728 Da), PEG11-biotin (922 Da), His6 (992 Da),
Alexa633 (1089 Da), and 3polyA (1275 Da). We note that these are relatively
large tags, 2–7 times larger than the largest amino acid (tryptophan,
204 Da), with different physicochemical properties. Fluorescein, Texas
Red, and Alexa633 are fluorescent dyes. Their hydrophobic nature potentially
allows specific binding modes to the inner lumen of the pore, but
might also promote protein aggregation and reduce protein solubility
in a fingerprinting approach, in which a protein should be labeled
at every 5–10 amino acids. The hydrophilic tags tested were
3polyA, His6, and PEG11-biotin. 3polyA is a small oligonucleotide
containing three adenine bases and a maleimide coupling group at the
5′-end. Due to the three phosphate groups, this tag has a net
negative charge. His6 is a stretch of six histidines with a maleimide
at the end. At the pH of our measurements (pH 7.5), this tag can carry
a neutral or single negative charge, given by its carboxyl group.
By lowering the pH to values closer to the pKa of histidine the number of charges of this tag can be modified.
Lastly, the PEG11-biotin structure is composed of 11 PEG units. PEG
is known to bind positive ions such as Na+, which is present
in our buffer. According to previous studies, a PEG molecule of 11
units can bind one Na+ ion at most, and therefore this
tag is likely to have a neutral or single positive charge.31,32

Figure 3 (a)
Different chemical structures used to label the peptide at
position C11. The six structures correspond to Texas Red (728 Da),
Alexa633 (1089 Da), 3polyA (1275 Da), fluorescein (427 Da), PEG11-biotin
(922 Da), and His6 (992 Da). (b) Histograms of the relative blockade
of unlabeled and labeled peptide mixtures. Two peaks can be observed
in each of the histograms. The first peak corresponds to the unlabeled
peptide, and the second peak corresponds to the labeled peptide with
each of the tags. These measurements were performed in buffer containing
1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.5. Peptide mixtures were
added in the cis chamber and measured at −90
mV. Data were recorded at 500 kHz and low-pass filtered with a Gaussian
filter at 10 kHz.

Figure 3b shows
the six relative blockade histograms observed for peptides labeled
with each of the six tags mentioned above. Example event traces for
each of the labels can be found in Figure S3. In each of these measurements, labeled and unlabeled peptides were
measured as a mixture, where the unlabeled peptide was acting as a
reference. Hence, two peaks can be observed in each of the histograms.
The first peak near 0.45–0.50 corresponds to the unlabeled
peptide, while the second peak near 0.56–0.66 corresponds to
the labeled peptide for each of the tags. The change in relative blockade
caused by each label, calculated by the difference in relative blockade
between the labeled and unlabeled peptide, is shown in Figure 4a. Only based on the change
in relative blockade, the tags can be categorized into two groups:
Texas Red, Alexa633, and 3polyA cause a large change in relative blockade
of 0.17–0.19, while fluorescein, His6, and Peg11-biotin cause
a smaller change of 0.10–0.11 (Figure 4b). As a control, we also attempted to measure
the free tags in solution, but translocation of these small groups
occurred too fast for reliable detection, verifying the virtue of
our tug-of-war approach.

Figure 4 (a) Relative blockade histogram for the mixture
of unlabeled peptide
and peptide labeled with Texas Red showing the change in relative
blockade. (b) Shift in relative blockade measured for each label.
Texas Red, Alexa633, and 3polyA cause a larger change in relative
blockade. (c) Correlation between the change in relative blockade
and parameter P = M × w/L, which characterizes the label’s
geometry (see inset) and molecular weight (R2 = 0.92).

Interestingly, the increase
in relative blockade produced by a
particular tag (Figure 4) does not correlate well with its molecular weight (R2 = 0.16), as shown in Figure S4. For example, while Texas Red has a lower molecular weight than
PEG11-biotin (728 Da vs 922 Da, respectively), it
generates a larger blockade. The poor correlation is potentially related
to their different geometry. While PEG has a linear and very flexible
structure, Texas Red is a more rigid extended structure comprising
multiple tightly packed aromatic rings. Indeed, one can imagine that
a larger number of ions is blocked by Texas Red when this label resides
in the constriction as compared to the linear structure of PEG that
most probably extends partially out of the constriction area. To find
an alternative figure of merit that takes into consideration both
the molecular weight and shape, we define a phenomenological parameter P = S x M, where M is its molecular weight of the label and S is a shape factor calculated as the ratio between the width (w) of the molecule and its length (L).
To calculate the length and width of the labels, an energy minimization
of each structure is done using molecular mechanics at the MM2 level
in ChemDraw 3D. This process returns the energy-minimized conformation
of the molecule. The parameter L is then calculated
as the length of the molecule across the longest axis, and the width
is measured perpendicular to the length (Figure 4c inset, Figure S5). Figure 4c shows
the increase in relative blockade measured for each label vs the calculated P value. A strong correlation
(R2 = 0.92) is observed between the increase
in relative blockade and parameter P, indicating
that not only the molecular weight of the label but also its geometry
affect the amount of current blocked by a label.

Different chemical
labels not only cause a measurably different
increase in the relative blockade but also influence the translocation
time of the peptide; see Figure 5, where panels a and b compare the scatter plots of
relative blockade vs dwell time for the peptide labeled
with His6 and with Alexa633, respectively. The dwell time is observed
to be significantly different, with a mean translocation time of 29
ms for Alexa633 vs 0.22 ms for His6. We find that
two main properties of the tags have an effect on the translocation
time, namely, charge and size. Charges present in the labels can act
to increase the electrophoretic force pulling toward the cis or the trans opening of the pore, thus increasing
or decreasing the translocation time, respectively. Control experiments
with peptides containing a constant number of 10 positive charges
in the C-terminus but varying number of negative
charges in the N-terminus (10, 12, or 14) showed
that the translocation dwell times increased with the increasing number
of negative charges, as expected (Figure S6). To account for size, we again take into consideration the size
(MW) and the geometry of the label through the parameter P. Figure 5c shows
the scatter diagrams of the dwell time vs the net
charge multiplied by P for each of the labels. A
strong correlation between these two characteristics is observed with R2 = 0.93.

Figure 5 Scatter plots of the peptide labeled with
(a) His6 and (b) Alexa633.
Faster translocation times are observed in peptides labeled with His6
compared to Alexa633. (c) Plot of dwell time vs net
charge × P, where P = M × w/L (see Figure 4). A correlation
(R2 = 0.93) is observed between these
parameters. The errors in the x-axis for fluorescein,
His6, and PEG11 represent the range of values that the parameter can
take due to the possible charged states of the molecules.

Toward Fingerprinting: Resolving Labels during Peptide Translocation
Above, we demonstrated the successful detection of chemical labels
in a model peptide, where a tug-of-war mechanism stalled the central
part of the peptide close to the pore constriction. While this represents
an important step forward to fingerprint proteins, peptides will be
translocating at a high speed in a more generalized nanopore fingerprinting
scheme, and label may escape detection due to an overly short detection
time. However, our data show that we can detect single labels “on
the fly” as a short dip in the current. As shown in Figures 6a and 2d, we observed a clear spike in the first fraction of the
event when measuring a peptide with a label in position C20. We quantified
the number of peaks in each of the events using a MATLAB script. As
shown in Figure 6b,
1978 out of a total of 2427 events, i.e., 81%, contained a clear single dip in the current. Only 315 events
(13%) contained no distinguishable peak, and 134 events showed more
than one peak (6%). The high percentage of events containing a single
peak (81%), even without any further optimization, is encouraging
for the realization of a generalized fingerprinting scheme. The small
percentage of events in which no peak is visible is likely due to
fast translocations of the label through the pore, which therefore
occasionally escapes detection due to the finite time resolution.
This percentage is expected to be reduced significantly if an enzyme,
such as ClpX, is used to enable controlled protein translocation through
the nanopore as previously shown by Nivala etal.33 ClpX is a robust enzyme
that can process modified substrates and can significantly reduce
the translocation time of polypeptides.34 Finally, event traces with more than one peak may be attributed
to multiple readings of the label due to thermal motion of the peptide.
Again, using a processing enzyme to control the translocation speed
of the peptide through the pore would reduce the occurrence of these
events.

20C. A decrease in current is observed in the first fraction of the
event as the labeled portion of the peptide moves through the FraC
pore. (b) Histogram of the number of peaks observed per event. Data
were recorded at −90 mV using a sampling frequency of 500 kHz.
Event traces were low-pass filtered at 5 kHz.

Conclusion
Using a bipolar peptide and the FraC nanopore
as a model system,
we studied the characteristics of different chemical labels and explored
their potential for a nanopore fingerprinting approach. Six different
labels were characterized in terms of their current blockade and translocation
time. We observed a correlation between the translocation time of
the peptide-tag system and the charge and size of the tags. Furthermore,
we could successfully interpret the current blockade generated by
a particular label if information about the geometry and molecular
weight of the label is available. Our study indicates that it is possible
to label amino acids with multiple distinguishable labels. We explored
different positions along the peptide sequence to find the most sensitive
region and showed that information about the position of the label
can be derived from their relative blockade and event characteristics.
Moreover, spikes in the current traces could be reproducibly observed,
consistent with a fingerprinting scheme where a polypeptide sequentially
translocates through the pore. Altogether, our results are very promising
for a protein fingerprinting approach in which different chemical
tags are used to label and recognize different amino acids.

Methods/Experimental
Peptide Design and Synthesis
The peptides used in this
work were the model peptide C11 with sequence EEEEEEEEEECGSGSGSKGSRRRRRRRRRR (HPLC
purity = 95.8%, MW = 3678.9 Da), model peptide with C15 with sequence
EEEEEEEEEESGSGCGSKGSRRRRRRRRRR
(HPLC purity = 95.1%, MW = 3678.9 Da), and model peptide with C20
with sequence EEEEEEEEEESGSGSGSKGCRRRRRRRRRR (HPLC purity = 95.7%, MW = 3678.9
Da). Peptides were synthesized by Biomatik Corporation (Cambridge,
CA, USA). The synthesis was performed using standard solid-phase methods,
and the peptides were further purified using reverse-phase HPLC and
analyzed by mass spectrometry (Biomatik). Peptides were kept lyophilized
or, when necessary, aliquoted in LC-MS grade water to a final concentration
of 10 mg/mL at −20 °C.

Chemical Tags Containing
a Maleimide Group
The maleimide-containing
molecules used as tags were fluorescein-5-maleimide (Thermo), Texas
Red C2 maleimide (Thermo), Alexa Fluor 633 C5 maleimide (Thermo),
EZ-link maleimide-PEG11-biotin (Thermo), Histidine6 maleimide (Biomatik),
5′-maleimide 3PolyA (Biosynthesis).

Peptide Labeling and Purification
Polypeptides containing
a cysteine residue were labeled using maleimide chemistry. For labeling,
the final peptide concentration was 1 mg/mL, and an excess of tag
from 10:1 was used. An exception was 3PolyA, where a ratio of 2:1
was used due to the low amounts of tag available. Labeling proceeded
at 4 °C overnight in 1× phosphate-buffered saline at pH
7. Labeling was done with degassed buffers and under nitrogen to prevent
cysteine oxidation. For synthetic peptides, no significant difference
in labeling was observed if cysteines were reduced previous to labeling,
and therefore tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Sigma-Aldrich) was not
necessary. Labeled peptides were purified using reverse-phase chromatography.
For that an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system was used with a Waters
CSH C18 column as the stationary phase and a mobile phase consisting
of a gradient of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA). HPLC fractions were collected and analyzed using MALDI-TOF
(Autoflex Speed). The matrix consisted of 10 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid and 0.2% TFA.

Electrical Recording in Planar Lipid Membranes
Electrical
recording were performed using planar lipid membranes as described
before.35,36 Briefly, a 25-μm-thick Teflon film
(Goodfellow Corporation, PA, USA) containing an orifice of approximately
70 μm separates the cis and trans compartments. To form the membranes, 10 μL of 5% hexadecane
in pentane is added to the Teflon film and the pentane is allowed
to evaporate. The reservoirs are filled with buffer and 10 μL
of 10 mg/mL 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(Avanti Polar Lipids) in pentane. Membranes were spontaneously formed
using the Montal–Mueller method.37 Ag/AgCl electrodes are placed in each compartment, with the ground
electrode in the cis side. WT FraC oligomers are
added to the cis side of the chamber.23,24 Upon pore insertion, the pore is characterized by measuring traces
at different voltages and taking an IV curve. The
substrate was added to the cis side of the chamber
and measured at −90 mV.

Data Acquisition and Analysis
Nanopore recordings were
collected using a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular
Devices, USA) at a filtering frequency of 100 kHz. The data were digitized
using an Axon Digidata 1550B digitizer at a sampling frequency of
500 kHz. The signal was low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and processed
using a Matlab script (Transalyzer).38 Event
traces were filtered at 5 kHz for display.
