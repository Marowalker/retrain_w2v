When a colloidal
suspension droplet evaporates from a solid surface,
it leaves a characteristic deposit in the contact region. These deposits
are common and important for many applications in printing, coating,
or washing. By the use of superamphiphobic surfaces as a substrate,
the contact area can be reduced so that evaporation is almost radially
symmetric. While drying, the droplets maintain a nearly perfect spherical
shape. Here, we exploit this phenomenon to fabricate supraparticles
from bidisperse colloidal aqueous suspensions. The supraparticles
have a core–shell morphology. The outer region is predominantly
occupied by small colloids, forming a close-packed crystalline structure.
Toward the center, the number of large colloids increases and they
are packed amorphously. The extent of this stratification decreases
with decreasing the evaporation rate. Complementary simulations indicate
that evaporation leads to a local increase in density, which, in turn,
exerts stronger inward forces on the larger colloids. A comparison
between experiments and simulations suggest that hydrodynamic interactions
between the suspended colloids reduce the extent of stratification.
Our findings are relevant for the fabrication of supraparticles for
applications in the fields of chromatography, catalysis, drug delivery,
photonics, and a better understanding of spray-drying.

==== Body
When a suspension
droplet evaporates
from a solid surface, the previously dispersed colloids remain on
the surfaces. The structure of the deposited colloids depends on the
wetting properties of the surface. If the suspension fully wets the
surface, a film is formed (Figure 1a). Evaporation of films and the resulting film formation
has been studied because of its relevance in applications such as
painting, coating, film formation, etc.(1) Due to the spatial symmetry of the drying process,
evaporation can be described by a single coordinate perpendicular
to the substrate.2−4

Figure 1 Schematic overview of drying suspension geometries occurring
in
nature and applications. Evaporation of (a) a horizontal film, (b)
an isolated drop on a partially wetted surface, (c) a drop on a super
liquid-repellent surface, and (d) a free drop.

The evaporation of isolated drops occurring on partially
wetted
surfaces is more complex (Figure 1b). Dispersion evaporation is common in daily life
and important for applications in printing,5 washing, forensics,6,7 or agriculture.8 The evaporation dynamics and the final structure of the
deposit have been widely investigated both experimentally and in simulations.9,10 For partially wetting isolated drops, the evaporation is no longer
homogeneous. If the apparent contact angle of the drop is below 90°
more liquid evaporates at the periphery than in the center. The resulting
radial flow of liquid enriches colloids at the periphery, where particles
aggregate and finally form a ring- or doughnut-like structure.11−17 As a result of line pinning at the periphery, drops often evaporate
at a constant contact radius rather than at a constant contact angle.

Another important case is the evaporation of free droplets, which
occurs, for example, in spray drying (Figure 1d). Spray drying is a widely used process
to fabricate powders from solutions or suspensions.18−23 In the case of a free spherical drop, evaporation is radially symmetric
and thus can also be described by a single coordinate.

During
the past decade, water and oil repellent surfaces, so-called
superamphiphobic surfaces have become available.24,25 Liquid droplets on these surfaces can maintain a spherical morphology
with a contact angle larger than 150°, while the interfacial
area between liquid and solid is extremely small, i.e., , where V is the volume
of the drop (Figure 1c). Usually superamphiphobic surfaces are also porous, allowing the
liquid to evaporate through the substrate. As a result, liquid evaporation
is almost radially symmetric and the flow is suppressed. Furthermore,
super-liquid-repellent surfaces allow for the fabrication of supraparticles.
Such supraparticles are typically 100–1000 μm in diameter
and consist of colloids that are 20–2000 nm in size. Supraparticles
were first formed from aqueous dispersions on superhydrophobic surfaces.26−35 Using superamphiphobic substrates, non-aqueous suspensions can be
applied, surfactants can be added, and, due to the extremely low real
contact area and the low adhesion, supraparticles can easily be removed
from the surface,36−38 allowing for the production of many supraparticles.
Fabrication of supraparticles on a super liquid-repellent surface
has the advantage that no surrounding processing liquid is required
as in the case of microfluidics. In contrast to spray drying, the
process can be carried out slowly under well-controlled boundary conditions
so that more-complex supraparticles can be designed. Using super-liquid-repellent
surfaces for the preparation of supraparticles may also help to improve
our understanding of spray drying.

Previous experimental and
simulation studies about drying colloidal
droplets on super-liquid-repellent surfaces have focused on monodisperse
colloids.26,28,31,33,35 The final packing of
the colloids depends on their interaction in suspension. For long-range
repulsive interactions, the colloids tend to form a closed-packed
crystalline structure. If at a certain level of concentration, attraction
takes over, the colloids aggregate and form a random and more porous
structure.

In this study, we aim to achieve more complex architectures
of
the supraparticles. We investigate both experimentally and in simulations
the drying processes of a bidisperse colloidal suspension, i.e., the mixture of colloids of two distinct sizes, small
(S) and large (L). Of particular interest is the distribution of colloids
in the suprapaticles, i.e., whether they remain homogeneously
distributed as in the initial suspension, or if they are able to form
ordered structures. Previous experiments of bidisperse colloids in
evaporating drops on superhydrophobic surfaces26 and in acoustically levitated drops39 suggested an enrichment of small colloids at the supraparticle
surface, but the details and mechanisms of the colloid segregation
remain largely unexplored.

The evaporation of such bidisperse
suspensions has been studied
in more detail for thin films experimentally40−42 and in simulations.40,43−49 It was found that depending on the particle size ratios, initial
volume fraction and evaporation speed, the smaller colloids end up
more to the top of the film. The larger colloids are pushed to the
bottom, creating “inverted” stratification. Qualitatively,
this segregation occurs because evaporation leads to a local increase
of the colloid concentration near the film–air interface, which,
in turn, translates to a chemical potential gradient for both colloid
species.44,45 Typically, this gradient is steeper for
the large colloids than for the small ones because more volume is
excluded to the large colloids. As a consequence, the large colloids
experience a stronger driving force pushing the colloids away from
the film–air interface. Inverted stratification then occurs
if the mobility of the large colloids decrease slower than the driving
force increases. The quantitative extent of stratification depends
on the specific system, e.g., whether the dispersed
particles are rigid colloids or flexible polymers43,45,49 and whether or not hydrodynamic interactions
are included in the theoretical description.47−49 For a more
comprehensive discussion on evaporating films, we refer to the recent
review by Schulz and Keddie.4

To
study the stratification in spherical drops, we investigated
the evaporation behavior of drying binary colloidal drops on a superamphiphobic
surface. Aqueous suspensions of polystyrene (PS) colloids of mean
diameters  and  were
used as a model system. Before drying,
the colloidal suspension making up the droplet contained a volume
fraction of  for small colloids and  for large colloids, respectively.
At the
end of the evaporation process, the total colloidal volume fraction
in the dried supraparticle reached .
With the help of scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), we observed a significant enrichment of small colloids at the
supraparticle surface with a concomitant depletion of large colloids
in this region. Toward the center of the supraparticles the two species
gradually mixed again. The extent of this separation became less pronounced
when we decreased the evaporation speed. Computer simulations confirmed
this dynamic stratification and provided additional information on
the colloid distribution during the evaporation process. These results
will help us to prepare supraparticles for various applications such
as in chromatography, catalysis, or for making photonic crystals.

Results
and Discussion
Evaporation of Drops
The relevant
parameter describing
the evaporation process of a suspension is the Péclet number
(Pe). It characterizes the relative contributions of advection and
diffusion to the motion of the colloids. For evaporating spherical
droplets, Pe is the ratio of the typical time, a dispersed particle
needs to diffuse one initial droplet radius, , and
the characteristic time of evaporation, . The evaporation time
can be expressed
as , where  is the initial droplet radius
and  is the speed of the receding droplet-air
interface. For (free) droplets, the evaporation is limited by the
diffusion of water molecules through the surrounding air,50 and the droplet volume  decreases as: 1  where  is the initial
volume of the droplet and  is the rate of surface
reduction. Taking
the time derivative of eq 1, one obtains for the initial vev the
following expression: 2  

For a free,
spherical droplet,  can be determined analytically, i.e.: 3  Here,  is the diffusion coefficient
of vapor molecules
in air,  is the mass of one vapor/liquid molecule,  is the density of the liquid,  is the difference
in pressure at the droplet
surface and outside the film of vapor, and  is the thermal energy of the system. For
sessile droplets which are shaped like a spherical cap, Picknett and
Bexon51 calculated the evaporation rate
and found: 4  with  with the contact angle , and f = 0.00008957 +
0.633θ + 0.116θ2 − 0.08878θ3 + 0.01033θ4 for θ (rad) above
10°. The pressure difference  in eqs 3 and 4 can
be expressed in terms
of relative humidity RH as  with saturation vapor pressure . We indeed observed a linear decrease
of  for the evaporation of pure water droplets
as well as the colloidal suspensions (Movie S1 and Figure S1). Using eq 4 for pure water droplets at our
experimental conditions (, , , and ), we find , which is in excellent agreement with the
value of  that we obtained from fitting
our results
with eq 1. Note that
these values for  are roughly 30% smaller
than the ones expected
for completely free spherical droplets. Droplets of suspensions evaporated
with the same kinetics as pure water droplets but with a slower rate
of  (Figure S1d).
We attribute the slight reduction in the evaporation rate to the reduced
surface area of the droplets caused by colloids coating the surface.

The characteristic diffusion time can be expressed as , where Dp is
the diffusion coefficient of the colloids. For a spherical particle
with stick boundary conditions, Dp can
be estimated through the Stokes–Einstein relation, i.e., , with suspension viscosity η. For dilute suspensions of spherical particles, Cichocki and Felderhof
showed that  can be estimated within reasonable accuracy
using ,52 with solvent
viscosity . This
expression can be considered a correction
of order  to the Einstein viscosity
equation.53,54 For the initial colloid volume fraction , we find that the suspension viscosity
increases by roughly 24% compared to the neat solvent (water in our
case).

In conclusion, we find  for evaporating spherical droplets,
which
is independent of the initial droplet radius. It should be noted that
the Péclet numbers quoted in this work refer to the beginning
of the evaporation process when the droplets have still their initial
radius, , and their initial colloid volume
fraction . As the droplet is drying, the (local)
colloid volume fraction increases, resulting in a (local) increase
of the suspension viscosity. Consequently, the Péclet numbers
increase over time and eventually become undefined once the colloids
jam or crystallize. Nevertheless, the initial Péclet numbers
are useful quantities for characterizing the drying regime of the
droplets.

Structure of Supraparticles
When the evaporation is
completed, the final supraparticle assumes a nearly spherical shape.
It took about 18 min for complete drying of a 2 μL () binary colloidal drop at ambient
conditions
(Figure S1d). Drops (2 μL) of our
dispersion led to supraparticles with a radius of Rf = 355 μm (Figure S2a). Given these processing conditions (α =
1046 ± 20 μm2/s, DS = 1.1 × 10−8 cm2/s
and DL = 2.6 × 10−9 cm2/s), we obtained  and  for the small and large
colloids, respectively.
Thus, diffusion is substantially slower than advection.

Small
colloids were enriched at the surface of supraparticles (Figure 2a,b). The small colloids
were assembled into close packed, crystalline regions with some line
and dot defects between the highly ordered regions. Only a small area
of the supraparticle surface was occupied by large colloids. These
seemed to anchor in particular in the defective regions between the
crystals formed by the small particles.

and large colloids. A more-extended cross-section showing more of
the inner part is shown in Figure S3. (c)

large () colloids

the Experimental Methods section for details).

To further analyze the distribution
of small and large colloids,
we cut the supraparticles in half (with a WEDO leather knife) and
imaged the internal structure using SEM. Segregation of the small
and large colloids was observed. The outer shell of roughly 20 μm
thickness contained almost exclusively small colloids (Figures 2a and S2b). They formed
well-ordered 3D crystal structures. Only few of the large colloids
were found in the shell. In contrast, the core part of the supraparticle
consisted mostly of large colloids (Figures 2b, S2c, and S3). The small colloids mainly
filled the interstitial spaces. No crystallization was observed in
this region. Stitching of a series of SEM pictures taken along a line
from the edge to the center shows the transition between these two
regions in detail (Figure 2b). The radial distribution of small and large colloids in
the supraparticle (Figure 2c) shows the clear spatial segregation between the two colloid
types, which manifests itself during evaporation. Note that the crystallization
of the smaller colloids that is observed in the outer layer of the
supraparticle does not contribute to the stratification effect but
is rather a consequence of the segregation. Furthermore, we did not
observe any indication of buckling or cracking of the dried supraparticles
in our experiments, as it can occur during spray drying due to skin
formation.55 In experiments on the formation
of supraparticles from monodispersed colloids, we could provoke crust
formation only by pronounced acceleration of the evaporation process,
using either temperatures close to the boiling point or applying vacuum
(manuscript in preparation). Increasing the droplet volume to 10 μL
leads to a flattening of the initial droplet due to gravity. As the
droplet shrinks during evaporation, it becomes spherical again as
its mass decrease. The evaporation rate of α = 884 μm2/s is slightly lower than for the small droplet. However,
the final deposit is nonspherical, as during the much longer evaporation
time, sedimentation of the PS particles sets in (Figure S4). This sedimentation for larger drop can be mostly
suppressed by density matching using D2O instead of H2O, leading to almost spherical supraparticles again (Figure S5).

Comparison to Simulations
For a more-comprehensive
understanding of segregation, we conducted complementary Langevin
dynamics simulations with an implicit solvent. Initially, the colloids
were uniformly distributed (Figure 3a and dotted line in Figure 3b). As the droplet dries, the small colloids
accumulate near the surface (dashed and solid red lines in Figure 3b). A corona consisting
almost exclusively of small colloids builds up. This shell is directly
followed by a region enriched by large colloids (dashed and solid
blue lines in Figure 3b), which extends over ∼15 μm in the final state. Additionally,
there are a few large colloids trapped at the droplet-air interface,
which are no longer able to move through the dense layer of small
particles. The core of the supraparticle is seemingly unaffected by
the evaporation, as we find the same composition and density of colloids
like in the beginning of the simulation. This behavior can be rationalized
by the large evaporation rate ( and ), which impedes diffusive mixing of the
core and shell regions.

colloids are , respectively. The initial colloid volume

times. The vertical black lines indicate the position of the receding
droplet–air interface at the respective times.

When overlaying the density of colloids after evaporation
from
the simulations with the experimental measurements, the results largely
agree (Figure 4). Because
the Péclet number is independent of the drop radius, we scaled
the radial coordinate and plotted both curves in one graph. Simulated
colloid densities qualitatively agree with the experimental results.
In both cases, we observe a higher density of large colloids in the
core. At a distance of  of the supraparticle radius, the small
colloids enrich and dominate the shell with the exception of a few
large colloids pinned at the surface of the supraparticle.

fractions of colloids after evaporation from simulations
(blue) and from experiments (red) versus the radial coordinate for
fast evaporation ().
Solid and dashed lines correspond to
data for large and small colloids, respectively.

A closer inspection of Figure 4 reveals that stratification is more pronounced in
the simulations. This discrepancy likely stems from the lack of hydrodynamic
interactions and liquid back flow in our simulation model. Indeed,
for drying films, it has been shown that hydrodynamic interactions
and liquid back flow can reduce the degree of stratification.47−49 The missing local hydrodynamics in the particle interaction is certainly
a limitation of our model. In contrast, large-scale hydrodynamics
due to Marangoni flow, as it occurs for sessile drops with pinned
contact line (coffee ring effect),11−15 can be excluded in our evaporation situation with
radial symmetry. Further note that the droplet radius, , in
experiments and simulations differs
by a factor of  (see
the Experimental
Methods section). Although the Péclet numbers are identical
in experiments and simulations, and thus qualitatively similar stratification
behavior is expected, the local structuring of the dispersed colloids
might be affected by the different size ratio between the colloids
and the drop; each colloid takes up relatively more space in the simulations
compared to the experiments, which could explain the more pronounced
layering found in the simulations. The surface-to-volume ratio of
the droplet is also bigger in the simulations, which further supports
the stronger separation between large and small colloids in the simulations
because stratification is driven by the receding boundary. Nonetheless,
the agreement between experiments and simulations is rather good,
underlining the robustness of the stratification process.

Low-Speed Evaporation
of Binary Colloidal Droplets
For planar films, the extent
of stratification depends on the evaporation
speed.4,40,44,56 To observe the effect of evaporation speed in radial
symmetry, we repeated our experiments at an increased relative humidity
of 68%. Increasing the humidity resulted in an increase in the evaporation
time from 18 min to 2 h (Figure S6). The
Péclet numbers for small and large colloids decreased to 27
and 110, respectively. Again, we observed a monotonic decrease of
droplet volume over evaporation time, with a rate of . Spherical supraparticles could still be
obtained even after prolonged evaporation (Figure S7a).

For slow evaporation, the colloids were distributed
more evenly in the supraparticle surface. Each large colloid was surrounded
by a similar volume of small colloids (Figure 5a,b). The cross-section shows that the core
region is enriched in large colloids and mixed with a low number of
small colloids (Figure 5b). The difference is, however, not as pronounced as after fast evaporation.
The shell between a radius of 220 and 280 μm was mostly occupied
by small colloids. When crossing over this layer, the number of small
colloids gradually decreased, while the density of large colloids
increased (Figure 5c). The small colloids did not crystallize in this case, presumably
because their concentration was not high enough. Such a weakening
of the inverted stratification is consistent with simulation results
(Figure S8).

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate that stratification
of evaporating
binary suspensions occurs not only for film-like geometry but also
for radial symmetric geometry. An almost-radial symmetry can be achieved
by evaporating drops of suspensions from superamphiphobic surfaces.
The distributions of small and large colloids in the supraparticles
depend on the evaporation speed. For fast evaporation, small colloids
form an outer shell, while the core is enriched by large colloids.
The small colloids in the shell form crystallites with several point
and line defects. Only a few large colloids are trapped at the surface
of the supraparticle, primarily at the site of defects. For slow evaporation,
large and small colloids form a disordered structure on the surface,
followed by an intermediate layer that is mostly occupied by small
colloids with several large colloids randomly distributed. At the
center of the supraparticles, the concentration of small colloids
gradually decreases, while large colloids are enriched.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Glass slides of 26 mm
× 76 mm in size
were provided by Menzel-Gläser, Germany. Tetraethoxysilane
(TEOS, reagent grade, 98%), Trichloro (1H, 1H, 2H, and 2H-perfluorooctyl)
silane (PFOTS, 97%), hexadecane (reagentPlus, 99%), and deuterium
oxide (D2O, 99.9 atom % D) were purchased from Aldrich.
Ammonia (28%), toluene, acetone, and ethanol absolute were provided
by VWR CHEMICALS. N-Hexane (95%) was purchased from
Fisher Chemical. Ultrapure water was produced by Sartorius Arium 611
VF Water purification System with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm.
PS colloids with a diameter of 338 nm and 1.43 μm were prepared
using surfactant-free emulsion polymerization57 and purified by several cycles of centrifugation and redispersion
in ultrapure water. Small and large particles therefore shared the
same surface chemistry.

Preparation of Soot-Template Superamphiphobic
Surfaces
Glass slides were first cleaned with toluene, acetone,
and ethanol
by ultrasonication, then dried under nitrogen flow. After treatment
of the glass slides with oxygen plasma (Diener Electronic Femto, 300
W for 5 min), candle soot was deposited on the glass slides.58 Afterward, the soot-coated glass slides were
placed in a desiccator together with two opened glass bottles containing
3 mL of TEOS and aqueous ammonia solution. The desiccator was closed,
evacuated to 250 mbar, and then vented with ambient air to atmospheric
pressure for chemical vapor deposition of TEOS (catalyzed with ammonia)
for 24 h. After the soot was coated with a silica shell, the soot
was burnt away at 550 °C for 3 h. In this way, a fractal-like
silica nanoparticle structure with overhangs was created. To achieve
superamphiphobicity, the surface was further modified with trichloro
(1H, 1H, 2H, and 2H-perfluorooctyl) silane by means of chemical vapor
deposition. Silica-coated surfaces were put into a desiccator together
with an opened glass bottle containing 0.1 mL of the silane. The desiccator
was evacuated to 50 mbar and left for 3 h to finally obtain the soot-template
superamphiphobic surfaces. The superamphiphobic substrate exhibited
good liquid repellent properties because it was constructed from fractal
silica structure with overhangs (Figure S9a) and further modified with perfluorosilane. Water and hexadecane
droplets form a spherical morphology. Water droplets possess a contact
angle over 170° (Figure S9b) with
a sliding angle about 1°, while hexadecane droplets have a contact
angle around 154° (Figure S9c) with
a sliding angle about 8° at a volume of 5 μL.

Evaporation
of Binary Colloidal Droplets on Superamphiphobic
Surfaces
A binary mixture of PS colloids with a diameter
of  (, where Pdi is the polydispersity
index)
and dS = 338 nm (0.011) was first prepared. The volume fractions
(vol %) of large and small colloids in the water were  and , respectively. A total of 2 μL
of
this suspension were dropped onto the superamphiphobic surface. Drops
were evaporated at 23 °C, either at ambient conditions (relative
humidity 24%), or at a relative humidity of 68% (measured with a TFA
Digital Thermo-Hygrometer). High humidity was achieved by putting
several opened water bottles around the superamphiphobic substrates
in a chamber and by allowing the system to equilibrate for about 0.5
h before placing the drop.

Characterization
Static and sliding
angles of 5 μL
of water and hexadecane droplets on a superamphiphobic surface were
measured with a goniometer, Dataphysics OCA35 (Data Physics Instruments
GmbH, Germany). The morphology of the soot-template superamphiphobic
surface and supraparticles were characterized by SEM (low-voltage
LEO 1530 Gemini, Germany). The samples were sputter-coated with a
5 nm layer of Pt using a BalTec MED 020 coater prior to taking images
to avoid charge buildup. The distributions of colloids in the supraparticles
from the experiments were obtained by analyzing the SEM images using
ImageJ software. The shape of the droplet during the evaporation process
was recorded with a side view camera (IDS uEye USB camera). The polydispersity
of the prepared PS colloids were characterized by dynamic light scattering
(Malvern Zetasizer Nano S90).

Simulations
In
the simulations, we modeled the colloidal
suspension as a binary mixture of large and small colloids with the
same size ratio  as in the experiments, and used  as
our unit of length. The colloid masses
were set accordingly to , with  being
the unit mass in the simulations.
The colloids interacted via the purely repulsive
Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) potential.59 For computational efficiency, we used an implicit
solvent model using Langevin dynamics simulations, which incorporates
the effects of Brownian motion and viscous drag from the solvent on
the colloids. The friction coefficient of the small colloid was set
to γS = 2.5, and it was adjusted
for the large colloid according to . This
implicit solvent representation neglects
solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions between the colloids. The
temperature was kept constant at T = 1.0 , where  is the interaction strength of the WCA
potential (see the Supporting Information for details). We obtained the time scale of our simulations by matching
the diffusion coefficients of the small colloids at room temperature
in water at infinite dilution using the Einstein relation Di = , which provides τ ≈ 0.0315
s.

The spherical shape of the droplet in the experiments is
reproduced by confining the colloids to a spherical domain with radius . The air–droplet interface
is modeled
through a harmonic potential: 5  

Here, the spring
constants  effectively
control the surface tension
and were chosen as  with .10,44,60 The harmonic
form of eq 5 stems from
geometric consideration of the change in surface area
when a colloid is placed at the interface with a contact angle of
90°. This model neglects hydrodynamic interaction between colloids
and interface but reflects repulsive interaction due to surface tension
preventing a hydrophilic particle to cross the interface. Evaporation
is mimicked by reducing  according to eq 1 until the droplet reached
its final size.
Our treatment of the droplet–air interface using an external
potential enforces a spherical droplet shape at all times and impedes
buckling of the dried supraparticle. Note, however, that neither buckling
nor cracking was observed in the experiments, which validates our
simulation approach.

The initial droplet had a radius of  μm, which is roughly six times smaller
than the experimental system due to computational limitations (the
total number of colloids in the simulations was ). Note that this reduction in droplet size
should not significantly alter the behavior of the system, as the
simulations were conducted at the same Péclet number as that
used in the experiments. The initial volume fractions of the large
and small colloids were chosen in line with those in the experiments, i.e.,  and , respectively. The simulation
time step
was set to , and all simulations were performed
using
the HOOMD-blue software package.61−63
