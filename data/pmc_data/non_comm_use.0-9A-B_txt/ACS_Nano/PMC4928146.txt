We
present a bottom-up assembly route for a large-scale organization
of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into three-dimensional (3D) modular
assemblies with core/satellite structure. The protein-assisted assembly
of small spherical gold or silver NPs with a hydrophilic protein shell
(as satellites) onto larger metal NPs (as cores) offers high modularity
in sizes and composition at high satellite coverage (close to the
jamming limit). The resulting dispersions of metal/metal nanoclusters
exhibit high colloidal stability and therefore allow for high concentrations
and a precise characterization of the nanocluster architecture in
dispersion by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Strong near-field
coupling between the building blocks results in distinct regimes of
dominant satellite-to-satellite and core-to-satellite coupling. High
robustness against satellite disorder was proved by UV/vis diffuse
reflectance (integrating sphere) measurements. Generalized multiparticle
Mie theory (GMMT) simulations were employed to describe the electromagnetic
coupling within the nanoclusters. The close correlation of structure
and optical property allows for the rational design of core/satellite
nanoclusters with tailored plasmonics and well-defined near-field
enhancement, with perspectives for applications such as surface-enhanced
spectroscopies.

==== Body
Plasmonic core/satellite nanoclusters
fabricated via self-assembly of subwavelength metal
nanoparticles are highly interesting for their potential applications
in the fields of optical metamaterials in particular optical sensing,1,2 superlensing (optical microscopy with super-resolution),3,4 and cloaking (invisibility devices),5,6 because these
type of structures can support electric,7,8 magnetic,7,9 and even Fano-like resonances.10−13 In addition, owed to the enhanced
electromagnetic fields (“hotspots”) between the NP building
blocks and the resulting high surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensitivity
of these clusters, core/satellite nanoclusters are also highly promising
for sensing applications such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) and SPR-shift-sensors,14 respectively.

The predominant approaches to fabricate such raspberry-like core/satellite
nanostructures are bottom-up strategies using organic (polystyrene,15,16 viruses,17,18 peptides,19etc.) or inorganic particles (SiO2,20−22 metals,10,14,23−36etc.) as cores and smaller inorganic nanoparticles
such as gold, silver, or semiconductor NPs as satellites. In particular,
in the case of (mere) metal/metal nanoclusters, organic linker molecules
are usually employed to create a permanent link between the core and
satellite particles.37 The main classes
of such organic linkers are (1) small α-ω end-functionalized
molecular linkers23−26 such as 1-9-nonanedithiol or p-aminothiophenol
(p-ATP), (2) larger functionalized polymeric linkers,10,14 (3) viruses,27 and most prominently (4)
linkers based on DNA base-pair interactions.28−35 The DNA-assisted assembly method yields by far the best-defined
nanocluster systems with precise structural order, relative geometry,
and interparticle distances compared to other mentioned methods and,
thus, represents the “gold standard” in terms of structural
perfection. However, this method suffers from restrictions in terms
of scalability because the resulting materials are restricted to low
yields owed to the arduous and costly DNA engineering steps.

In most of the above-mentioned cases, the core–satellite assemblies
are performed in dispersions without additional purification, i.e., the isolation of nanoclusters.10,14,26,29−33 General issues of the separation of the nanoclusters from the free
building blocks are related to low yields, and inadequate colloidal
stability to the harsh purification conditions.25 Recently, isolated metal/metal core/satellite type assemblies
have been achieved on solid substrates via sequential
adsorption of NPs and α-ω functionalized linker molecules.23−25,28 However, these structures are
immobilized to solid supports and thus restricted in their properties
and applications. Although in some cases core/satellite nanoassemblies25 can be released from the support to form stable
dispersions of asymmetric core/satellite structures, they may
also suffer from low yields and undefined plasmonic properties. To
the best of our knowledge, a simple method for producing three-dimensional
(3D) metal/metal plasmonic nanoclusters in large-scale quantities
and concentrations with tunable plasmonic properties and high colloidal
stability and purity in solution has not been reported so far.

In this work, we present a simple and novel protein-assisted assembly
process for the fabrication of metal/metal 3D core/satellite nanoclusters
self-assembled in solution (Figure 1). This approach is highly modular in respect to size
and the composition of the building blocks in combination with high
satellite coverage close to the jamming limit. In addition, this method
allows for the large-scale fabrication of plasmonic clusters with
tunable optical properties. Such nanoclusters exhibit extraordinary
optical properties due to plasmonic near-field coupling between the
core and satellite NPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study of such metal/metal
core/satellite nanoclusters. To reveal precise structural information,
a suitable three-dimensional model including strong particle correlations
(close to jamming limit) needed to be developed. We combine the results
from SAXS, UV/vis spectroscopy, and electromagnetic simulations to
correlate the structural parameters with the plasmonic coupling within
core/satellite architectures. The fundamental understanding of metallic
core/satellite assemblies reveals their potential for tailored plasmonics
in the fields of surface-enhanced spectroscopy and design of magneto-optical
metamaterials.38

Results and Discussions
Protein-Assisted Self-Assembly
of Nanoclusters
The approach for the synthesis of 3D plasmonic
core/satellite nanoclusters via protein-assisted
self-assembly is based on the physisorption of proteins to the particles
in combination with their high binding affinities to metals.39−46 The proteins act as an adhesive layer between the core and the satellite
particles. Hence, in order to achieve a self-assembly of satellite
NPs around the core NP, the satellite particles are first coated with
a robust and homogeneous protein shell, as previously reported.39−45 As depicted in Figure 1A, these colloidally stable protein-coated NPs bear sufficient functional
groups such as thiols/disulfides, amines, and carboxylates to readily
bind (unspecifically) to the metal surface of the core NPs, resulting
into metal–core/metal–satellite nanoclusters. Hereby,
the surface chemistry of the core particle before the assembly process, i.e., the original coating/stabilizing agent, is of paramount
importance. There are three prerequisites that the original stabilizing
agent has to fulfill in order to ensure a successful particle assembly:
(1) it has to provide sufficient colloidal stability to the core particles
to avoid aggregation during the assembly process; (2) it should bind
weakly enough to the core particle surface in order to be replaced
easily by the protein-coated satellite NPs; and (3) the interactions
between the original coating molecules and proteins (protein coatings)
should be low in order to ensure the colloidal stability of the resulting
core/satellite nanoclusters. In this context, low-molecular-weight
stabilizing molecules such as citrate39−41 and tannic acid47 have proven to be ideal stabilizing agents for
the nanoparticle building blocks. First, these molecules have relatively
low molecular weights (lower than proteins) and bind weakly to the
gold nanoparticle surface and thus can be easily replaced by large
proteins.39−41,47 Second, they exhibit
a negative net charge and therefore do not interact with negatively
charged proteins and protein coatings (i.e., at pH
values above the isoelectric point) as shown recently.45

Hence, in the present study, we employ
spherical gold and silver NPs in the size range of 5–100 nm,
synthesized via different synthesis methods, as reported
elsewhere (see Experimental Section).47−51 Smaller NPs, typically with sizes below 35 nm, were used as satellites and larger NPs served as cores.

Figure 1A shows
the general self-assembly process for the formation of plasmonic core/satellite
nanoclusters. For instance, employing building blocks such as 16 ±
2 nm satellite NPs (Figure 1B) and 84 ± 8 nm core NPs (Figure 1C) can form colloidally stable Au84/Au16
core/satellite nanoclusters (Figure 1D). The size and the structure of the nanoclusters
and their building blocks were determined by SAXS analysis, which
will be discussed later in detail (see Elucidation
of Structural Composition). The 16 nm spherical citrate-stabilized
gold NPs were synthesized using the well-known citrate reduction method,49 and coated subsequently with BSA in a ligand-exchange
process (Figure 1B,
inset), yielding homogeneous protein coating on the nanoparticles,
as reported elsewhere.39−45 The choice of the protein used for satellite coating, which functions
as the “glue” in the assembly, strongly influences the
structure formation. We tested different proteins in an effort to
generate nanoclusters with different satellite coverage and satellites-to-core
spacing (see Supporting Information, Figures
S1–S4). In this work, we focus on nanoclusters assembled with
BSA because these structures turned out to be the most robust system
for the correlation of structure and optical properties. The satellite
NPs reveal their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at 519
nm for citrate-coated NPs (Figure S5B)
and 524 nm after protein coating (Figure 1E, red solid curve). Importantly, the protein-coated
satellite NPs are highly purified (no protein excess) and exhibit
high colloidal stability. Therefore, they can be concentrated to high
particle concentrations,41,44 which is essential
in this cluster formation process. The designated Au core particles
with an LSPR at 552 nm (Figure 1E, violet solid curve), which are also stabilized by citrate,
were synthesized using the citrate reduction-based seeded-growth method
reported by Puntes et al.(50) Finally, for the self-assembly of the satellite NPs onto the core
surface, the core NPs were incubated with an excess of protein-coated
satellite NPs, with a core-to-satellite ratio of 1:1000 (core NPs/satellite
NPs).

The high excess of satellite NPs not only minimizes interparticle
bridging of core particles, yielding stable and individually dispersed
nanoclusters, but also ensures high surface coverage of the cores.
Owed to the high colloidal stability of the satellite NPs and of the
final nanoclusters, their separation becomes possible, simply via centrifugation (Figure S6). After the removal of the satellite NPs, the dominant LSPR at 600–620
nm of the self-assembled nanoclusters becomes more pronounced (Figure 1E and Figure S6), which is only present in such core/satellite
structures (see Figure S7 for the control
experiment). This mode indicates strong core-to-satellite coupling,
which will be discussed in detail in the section Fundamental Coupling Scenarios.

The final purified product
consisted of a dark blue dispersion (Figure 1D, inset), containing individually dispersed
core/satellite nanoclusters (Figure 1E, blue curve). The clusters were characterized via transmission (TEM, Figure S6C) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 1D) and UV/vis spectroscopy (Figure 1E). The UV/vis spectra of nanoclusters
revealed two plasmonic modes: (1) a dominant radiant mode at 615 nm
(strong core-to-satellite coupling, weak satellite-to-satellite coupling),
which is 91 nm (satellite) and 63 nm red-shifted (core) from the LSPRs
of its building blocks (see Figure 1E); and (2) a less pronounced nonradiant mode (weak
core-to-satellite coupling, strong satellite-to-satellite coupling),
which appears as a shoulder on the left flank of spectrum between
520 and 540 nm. We will focus on the explanation and quantification
of the radiant and nonradiant nature of these modes in the final section
of this paper (see Fundamental Coupling Scenarios and Influence of Satellite Disorder).

For plasmonic nanostructures and assemblies, it is well-known that
parameters such as particle size, shape, and composition determine
the final optical properties of a plasmonic nanomaterial.52,53 Particularly, in the case of assemblies of plasmonic particles,
other parameters such as the interparticle distances and the relative
geometry of the particles to each other can also have a huge impact
on the final optical properties of assembled systems.42,54,55 In the following, we demonstrate
that the protein-assisted self-assembly approach is highly modular
in terms of parameters such as size and composition (i.e., the material) of the building blocks, allowing for variable intercombinations
of different metal NPs (e.g., gold and silver NPs
of different sizes) as core or satellites. Thus, this method is simple,
highly modular, and versatile, allowing for facile tuning of the optical
properties of such plasmonic assemblies in a broad range of the visible
spectrum simply by changing these parameters. The simplicity of the
approach in terms of varying particle size and composition and their
influence on the optical/plasmonic properties of the clusters is discussed
in detail in next section.

Modularity in Size and Composition
The modularity of the protein-assisted assembly process in size and
composition is shown in Figure 2. Homometallic Au-core/Au-satellite nanoclusters (Figure 2A–C) and heterometallic
Au-core/Ag-satellite nanoclusters (Figure 2D) were formed utilizing citrate-stabilized
84 nm gold NPs with an LSPR at 552 nm (Figure 2A–C, bottom, violet solid curve) for
all four nanocluster systems and BSA-coated satellite nanoparticles
(see Figure S5). For the homometallic gold
nanoclusters, satellite NPs of different sizes, namely 5 nm (Figure 2A), 16 nm (Figure 2B), and 32 nm (Figure 2C) were used. For
the heterometallic Au-core/Ag-satellite nanoclusters, silver NPs of
21 nm in size were employed as satellites (Figure 2D).

Figure 2 Modularity of nanoclusters in size and composition.

core/satellite nanocluster dispersions (insets, bottom) with the same
84 nm-sized Au cores. BSA-coated Au satellites of increasing diameters
(A) 5 nm, (B) 16 nm, and (C) 32 nm were used for the homometallic
nanoclusters, showing the size modularity. BSA-coated Ag satellites
of 21 nm in diameter were employed for the heterometallic nanoclusters
(D), demonstrating the modularity of the assembly process in composition.

The homometallic gold core/satellite
nanoclusters exhibited a dominant LSPR (i.e., the
radiant mode) at different wavelengths, depending on the size of the
satellite NPs; all red-shifted differently from the LSPRs of their
building blocks. Furthermore, the nonradiant mode i.e., the shoulder on the left flank of the spectra, was less pronounced
for the smaller satellites (Figure 2A) and more strongly pronounced for the bigger satellite
NPs (Figure 2B,C):
For the smallest satellite NPs of 5 nm, the radiant mode of Au84/Au5
nanoclusters was located at 566 nm and the nonradiant mode was poorly
pronounced (Figure 2A). With medium-sized satellite NPs of 16 nm, the radiant-mode of
Au84/Au16 nanoclusters shifted to 615 nm and the nonradiant mode ranged
between 520 and 550 nm (Figures 1E and 2B). For the large satellites
of 32 nm, the radiant mode of Au84/Au32 nanoclusters was located at
657 nm with a pronounced mode splitting and a separate nonradiant
mode at 533 nm (Figure 2C). In general, one would expect a more pronounced redshift of the
radiant mode for increasing satellite sizes. However, besides building
block sizes also differences in core-to-satellite spacing and satellite
coverage need to be taken into account. The radiant mode corresponds
to core-to-satellite coupling, which will be discussed in detail in
the section Fundamental Coupling Scenarios in the framework of plasmonic mode hybridization.

In the case
of Au-core/Ag-satellite nanoclusters, 21 nm-sized silver satellites
were synthesized using the sodium citrate/tannic acid reduction method
for silver NPs reported by Puntes et al.(47) The as-synthesized silver satellite NPs exhibited
their LSPR at 407 nm (Figure S5D) and at
406 nm after protein coating with BSA. For the self-assembly of heterometallic
Au/Ag nanoclusters, an excess of protein-coated Ag satellite NPs was
chosen, close to the ratio used for homometallic gold nanoclusters
(see Experimental Section).

The final
purified dispersions of the Au/Ag nanoclusters exhibited a pronounced
brown color in transmission (Figure 2D, inset) and bluish color in reflectance (data not
shown) in contrast to the dispersions of the individual building blocks.
The Au/Ag nanoclusters also exhibited two distinct plasmonic modes.
The first mode at 420 nm can be clearly attributed to the strong contribution
of the Ag satellites. The second mode at higher wavelengths (617 nm)
can be assigned to the strong coupling between the gold core particles
and the silver satellite NPs. In comparison to homometallic gold nanoclusters
(Au/Au), the splitting of the plasmonic modes of heterometallic nanoclusters
(Au/Ag) is much more pronounced yielding two distinct LSPR bands (Figure 2D).

The optical
response of core/satellite nanoclusters is sensitive to the size and
the composition of the building blocks, the number of satellites (i.e., surface coverage), the core-to-satellite separations,
and the order/disorder in distribution of satellites. In the following,
we will elucidate the structural composition of a selection of homometallic
and heterometallic nanoclusters via SAXS measurements
performed on their dispersions, in order to obtain the above-mentioned
structural parameters for the various core/satellite nanoclusters
(Figures 1 and 2).

Elucidation of Structural Composition: Nanocluster
Morphology, Sizes, and Distances
SAXS represents a powerful
tool for obtaining precise information on length scales from ∼100
nm down to ∼0.1 nm from samples in solution. In case of samples
with low dispersity in size, very precise information on intra- and
interparticle distances can be obtained by fitting the measured scattering
curves with an appropriate model. The presented nanoclusters are especially
well suited for such an investigation as their building blocks are
scattering at very different q-values.

Figure 3 shows the exemplary
characterization of the homometallic Au84/Au16 nanoclusters (compare Figure 1 and Figure 2B) with SAXS. The core with
a radius of 42 nm has its first form factor minimum at a q-value of about 0.1 nm–1, whereas the satellites
have theirs at 0.6 nm–1. The building blocks are
all made of gold, which offers high and uniform contrast. As a result,
the obtained scattering curves show distinct and well-pronounced features
that allowed us to apply three-dimensional modeling to fit the SAXS
data with a very low uncertainty. The applied model was based on 3D
structures of nanoclusters with a disordered distribution of satellites
following a random sequential adsorption (RSA) mechanism. The protein
shell of BSA was not considered for the scattering as it has a negligible
contrast compared to gold. Instead, the presence of the BSA shell
was accounted for by the core-to-satellite distance. In the literature,
an analytical model for Pickering-type emulsions is described,56 which with a few modifications was easily applied
to our data. However, this model cannot account for strong particle
correlations. As our system is close to the jamming limit for randomly
adsorbed particles on a surface, such particle correlations need to
be taken into account. Thus, we chose to fit the scattering data by
directly calculating the ensemble-averaged scattering pattern of a
large set of nanoclusters utilizing the formula of Debye.57 The parameter space of core-to-satellite distance
and surface coverage (number of satellites) was screened by a brute-force
approach i.e., calculating all possible combinations
(in steps of 0.5% coverage and 0.1 nm distances) and judging their
quality based on the corresponding mean squared error. Details on
this approach as well as a comparison of the analytical model and
the 3D-modeling approach can be found in the Supporting Information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of metallic core/satellite nanoclusters.

of the structural composition of core/satellite nanoclusters via small-angle X-ray scattering on the example of Au84/Au16
nanoclusters: (A) 16 nm BSA-coated satellite NPs, (B) 84 nm citrate-stabilized
core NPs, and (C) the final Au84/Au16 core/satellite nanoclusters.
The building blocks of the clusters were fitted with a model for polydisperse
spheres (red and violet solid lines). The clusters were fitted with
a three-dimensional core/satellite model based on the ensemble-averaged
scattering of 10 individual randomly assembled nanoclusters (blue
solid line, Table 1, column 1).

Using three-dimensional
modeling, we were able to obtain structural parameters from the experimental
data (see Figure 3).
The sizes and the polydispersity of the building blocks were determined
by fitting the respective scattering curves with SASview58 and a simple model of polydisperse spheres (Figure S8A,B). Thus, only the coverage and the
core-to-satellite distance needed to be varied (see Figures S8C and S9) for fitting the cluster data.

Table 1 shows the structural parameters for the nanoclusters assembled
with BSA-coated satellites (for additional information see Figure S10). The first two columns show the results
for the BSA-mediated homometallic Au84/Au16 and heterometallic Au84/Ag21
nanoclusters with a core size of 42 nm in radius. The best fit revealed
an average coverage of 35 satellites for the homometallic clusters
and 11 satellites for the heterometallic nanoclusters per core at
an ensemble-averaged core-to-satellite distance of 4.3 and 4.0 nm,
respectively. The core-to-satellite distance is most likely determined
by the hydrated protein monolayer between the core and the satellite
NPs. However, the 3D structure of the proteins between the core and
the satellite NPs, which is hard to determine and yet unresolved,
may differ from the unassembled satellite NPs and the free protein
in solution.

The given errors indicate the uncertainty of the ensemble-averaged
core-to-satellite distance and number of satellites per core, respectively
(see Supporting Information).

To show the size modularity of the
core particle, we employed smaller NPs of 35.3 ± 3.9 nm radius
and satellites of 7.2 ± 0.8 nm radius (Table 1, column 3 and Figure S2D). Remarkably, the core-to-satellite distances for the homometallic
clusters with the smaller core (R ≈ 35 nm)
were found to be larger (e.g., 6.2 ± 0.5 nm
for BSA-mediated nanoclusters, Table 1, column 3) than the corresponding nanoclusters with
the bigger core (R ≈ 42 nm, Table 1, column 1). The reason why
the core-to-satellite distances for the smaller core are larger is
not clear yet. The environmental parameters, such as pH, ionic strength,
temperature, and core-to-satellite ratio were kept constant for all
assemblies. Nevertheless, the interparticle distances for all the
clusters with the same core size lie consistently in the same range.
A systematic SAXS study on tuning the interparticle distances within
the nanoclusters accompanied by numerical and analytical modeling
is the subject of ongoing work.

To correlate nanocluster structure
and the optical response advanced modeling is required, addressing
the fundamental coupling scenarios to evaluate the influence the structural
changes on the optical properties. In the following, we will focus
on one single nanocluster system to further quantify the effects of
the structural composition on its electromagnetic characteristics.
We have chosen the homometallic Au84/Au16 nanocluster with BSA-coated
satellites because of the strong red shift of the radiant mode, pronounced
mode splitting at high coverage of satellites, and the uniform X-ray
scattering contrast of its building blocks.

Fundamental Coupling Scenarios
To elucidate the optical response of core/satellite nanoclusters,
we first turn our attention to a model with a symmetric distribution
and high coverage of satellites at the core surface (polygon model,
see Figure S11). The two fundamental coupling
scenarios can be described by a generalized hybridization model59 (see Figures S12 and S13 for details).

As depicted in Figure 4A, both the single core and the orbit of
satellites, for itself, form purely dipolar polarization states. When
combined, two distinct modes arise in the extinction spectrum: a high-energy
nonradiant mode with dominant absorption, and a low-energy radiant
mode with dominant scattering. The nonradiant mode is shifted toward
the blue below the excitation wavelength of the core. The electric
field enhancement (Figure 4B) and the surface charge density (Figure 4C) show that the satellite-to-satellite coupling
is dominant, while the satellite-to-core coupling is rather weak.
Considering the difference in interparticle distances between the
nanocluster components in this model (core-to-satellite 4 nm; satellite-to-satellite
8 nm = 2× shell thickness of the protein layer in wet state)
and the size ratio of the building blocks (diameter core/satellite
= 84 nm/16 nm), one would expect the contrary. This can be explained
by the antenna–receiver principle.60 At lower wavelengths (compared to the core), the orbit of satellites
acts as an antenna because the dipole moments of smaller particles
are excited more easily by the present electric field. As a result,
the core receives its polarization not from the external electric
field but from the satellites (psatellites), which can be clearly identified from the mirror charge patterns
formed at the core surface (see Figure 4C). At higher wavelengths (compared to the core), the
core acts as antenna and is directly polarized by the electric field
(pcore). Consequently, the polarization
of all satellites is oriented toward the core (see Figure 4A). For this low-energy radiant
mode, satellite-to-satellite coupling is almost completely absent
(Figure 4D). The dominant
core-to-satellite coupling also results in a charge inversion of neighboring
satellites at the meridian of the core (see Figure 4E). Thus, the two plasmonic modes shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be clearly attributed to the two principle coupling scenarios,
as explained by this simple model of a nanocluster with a symmetric
distribution and high coverage of satellites.

charge densities with black arrows representing the orientation of
the local dipole moments. (B) Electric field enhancement of the high-energy

(E) Surface charges showing the dominant core-to-satellite coupling.

In the following, we address the
close correlation of nanocluster structure and optical response to
develop strategies for plasmonic tailoring.

Influence of Structural
Changes on the Optical Response
To develop rational design
criteria for core/satellite architectures, we first try to reproduce
the experimental UV/vis spectrum of the Au84/Au16 nanoclusters using
structural information determined by SAXS. The SAXS results for the
sizes of the building blocks are in high accordance with values obtained
from UV/vis spectroscopy and simple electromagnetic modeling (see Figure S14).

Figure 5A compares the experimental optical response
of Au84/Au16 nanoclusters to modeled extinction spectra. The gray
lines indicate the position of the measured radiant (λr) and nonradiant (λnr) modes. Although an ideally
symmetric distribution of 30 satellites is quite close to the measured
response, the experimental extinction curve (ratio and position of
modes) cannot be described sufficiently without interpolation for
variable numbers of satellites. To address this issue, we focus on
the spectral shift of the dominant low-energy radiant mode. Figure 5B shows the correlation
of the core-to-satellite distance and the number of satellites. Considering
only the measured extinction, neither the interparticle gaps nor the
number of satellites can be determined. Taking into account the structural
information from SAXS analysis, we find the best agreement for an
Au84/Au16 nanocluster of 36 ± 2 satellites at a core-to-satellite
distance of 4 ± 1 nm (see Table S1). The trend toward slightly shorter interparticle distances (compared
to SAXS) may result from changes in refractive index caused by the
presence of the protein coating around the satellites (for details
on refractive index sensitivity, see Figure S15). Tailoring of the nanocluster composition and morphology offers
access to designed plasmonics in a broad range of wavelengths. However,
the experimentally realized nanoclusters inherently possess asymmetric
distributions of satellites owing to nonequidistant satellite-to-satellite
distances (disorder) and the resulting steric limitations (jamming).

separations of 4 nm (30 black, 36 blue, and 60 black line) and compared
to an individual core particle (red line). The dominant radiant mode
(λr) corresponds to the core-to-satellite coupling.
Its spectral shift serves as a calibration from which the ensemble-averaged
core-to-satellite distance and the number of satellites can be evaluated.
The outstanding agreement of the (B) symmetric distribution and the
(D) disordered distribution of satellites evidence the robustness
of the optical response against disorder. In panels B and D, a 4 nm
core-to-satellite distance (blue line) and 36 satellite particles
agrees best with the experimental UV/vis data (Exp., orange). (C)
The Au84/Au16 nanoclusters exhibit a high surface coverage close to
the maximum number of satellite particles (jamming limit, blue area).

Influence of Satellite
Disorder
In the following, we draw our attention toward disorder
in satellite distribution. For this purpose, we applied a model taking
a random sequential adsorption of satellite particles and the consequent
coverage (jamming) limit into account. As shown in Figure 5A (blue line), a random distribution
of 36 satellite particles closely reproduces the characteristics of
the Au84/Au16 experimental data. Figure 5C shows the jamming limit with numbers of
satellites given for various core-to-satellite distances. The Au84/Au16
nanoclusters are close to the maximum coverage expected for RSA-based
assemblies. The deviation of the experimentally realized coverage
from the theoretical prediction may indicate the presence of additional
electrostatic repulsive interactions between satellite particles.
The regime of inaccessible nanocluster compositions is also plotted
in Figure 5D. Here,
each data point represents 10 RSA-assembled clusters with the corresponding
variances of the radiant modes plotted as error bars. The remarkable
accordance of the predictions from the ideally symmetric clusters
(gray regression lines in Figure 5B,D) and the randomly assembled clusters (RSA model;
data points in Figure 5D) evidence the robustness of the optical response against satellite
disorder, albeit for core-to-satellite distances at low surface coverages
below 2 nm a distinct deviation toward lower wavelengths can be found.
However, for the Au84/Au16 nanoclusters, the unperturbed coupling
of satellites can be assumed.

To proof the robustness against
disorder, i.e., variations in satellite-to-satellite
distances, we investigated the scattering and absorption contributions
(losses) of the optical extinction. The strong agreement of experimental
(Figure 6A) and modeled
data (Figure 6B) clearly
indicates the presence of two fundamental excitation regimes, each
a prerequisite for distinct applications. The line width in Figure 6B represents the
variance of the optical response based on 10 individual randomly assembled
nanocluster configurations. Figure 6C,D shows the surface charge densities of an exemplary
disordered Au84/Au16 nanocluster. At an excitation of 532 nm (see Figure 6C), the coupled satellites
induce a mirror charge pattern at the core surface (green arrows,
compare Figure 4C).
At 633 nm, the dipolar excitation of the core is dominant. Consequently,
all satellites are coupled to the core (see Figure 6D).

Figure 6 Nonradiant and radiant regimes of core/satellite
nanoclusters. (A) Diffuse reflectance UV/vis spectroscopy measurements
and (B) simulated absorption (blue line) and scattering contributions
(red line) of the total extinction of Au84/Au16 (black line). Main
excitation states shown by surface charge densities in the nonradiant
and radiant regime (insets in B). The charge distribution of the core
surface at (C) 532 nm mirrors the dominant intersatellite coupling
(green arrows), whereas (D) at 633 nm, the dipolar excitation of the
core and the resulting core-to-satellite coupling are dominant.

This proves that the two distinct
coupling scenarios are unperturbed by disorder and their optical response
is maintained (compare Figure 4A). Hence, ideally symmetric systems are not mandatory. Furthermore,
the size of the core particle itself is a fundamental modality, for
which a linear dependency was found regarding the spectral red shift
of the radiant mode (see Figure S16). The
high modality of the presented system may be exploited to gain control
over the ratio of coupling between the building blocks, e.g., the coupling between the satellites can be fully suppressed. This
opens up possibilities for tailored nanoclusters with designed optical
responses and “hotspot” locations. The latter would
allow for spatial differentiation of the electric field enhancement, i.e., predominantly between the satellites or exclusively
in the gaps between core and satellites (compare Figure 4, panels B and D).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the protein-assisted self-assembly route presented
in this work represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of
three-dimensional colloidal nanoassemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles
with core/satellite structure in dispersion. These plasmonic nanoclusters
exhibit high colloidal stability and thus can be purified and concentrated
to desired concentrations. The presented approach allows for tailoring
on the nanoscale and provides access to colloidally stable and nanostructured
plasmonic materials. In comparison to the assembly approaches reported
in literature that use molecular linkers such as DNA or α-ω
functionalized alkanes, or electrostatic interactions, the protein-assisted
self-assembly method goes beyond the level of proof-of-principle and
gives access to a readily available nanoassembled system.

The
fabrication of stable nanoclusters was shown for homo- and heterometallic
core/satellite combinations, with variable sizes of the building blocks,
using bovine serum albumin. The protein serves as a multifunctional
coating material, which acts as an adhesion layer, enabling cluster
formation and as a soft spacer setting the core-to-satellite distances.
The protein-coated satellites adsorb onto the core NP in a random
sequential adsorption manner, leading to a disordered distribution
of satellites on the core. Such core/satellite assemblies inherently
exhibit two plasmonic modes based on distinct coupling regimes: (1)
a nonradiant mode with dominant satellite-to-satellite coupling and
(2) a radiant mode with dominant core-to-satellite coupling. Strikingly,
the plasmonic coupling was found to be robust against disorder. Thus,
ideally symmetric assemblies are not mandatory. The structural parameters
of the metallic core/satellite assemblies were studied in dispersion via small-angle X-ray scattering. For fitting the SAXS data,
we developed an extended three-dimensional model based on the analytical
model for Pickering emulsions,56 taking
strong particle correlations (close to the jamming limit) into account.
The high modularity in sizes, composition, and satellite coverage
enables precise optical and structural tailoring of three-dimensional
nanoassemblies. Emerging fields such as subwavelength wave-guiding,
photovoltaics, electric field enhancement, and metamaterials may benefit
from the facile and readily up-scalable synthesis of designed nanoclusters.
In particular, such plasmonic clusters open new avenues for biosensing
applications based on SERS, exploiting biorecognition or guest–host
interactions of proteins, which are intrinsically located right in
the “hotspots”.

were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cethyltrimethylammonium bromide
(≥99%, CTAB) was purchased from Merck KGaA. Sodium hydroxide
concentrate (0.1 M, NaOH) was purchased from Grüssing GmbH.
All chemicals were used as received. Milli-Q water was used in all
experiments. All glassware was cleaned with aqua regia and rinsed extensively with Milli-Q water before use.

Synthesis of
Citrate-Stabilized 5 nm AuNPs
Quasi-spherical citrate-stabilized
AuNPs with an average particle size of ∼5 nm were synthesized
by the borohydride reduction protocol reported by Jana et
al.(48) A 20 mL aqueous solution
containing 0.25 mM sodium citrate and 0.25 mM HAuCl4 solution
was prepared in a glass vial and thoroughly mixed. Then, 0.6 mL of
a 0.1 M freshly prepared NaBH4 solution was injected in
one shot under vigorous stirring. After 2 min, the stirring was turned
off and the solution was allowed to age for an additional 45 min.
The final dispersion appeared brownish-red in color.

Synthesis of
Citrate-Stabilized 16 nm AuNPs
Quasi-spherical citrate-stabilized
AuNPs with an average particle size of ∼16 nm were synthesized
by the citrate reduction method.49 In a
1 L Erlenmeyer flask, 1.75 mL of a 0.1 M HAuCl4 solution
was added to 750 mL of Milli-Q water under stirring at room temperature
and the solution was heated to boiling. Then, 18 mL of a 1 wt % sodium
citrate solution was injected to the solution under vigorous stirring.
The color of the solution changed from clear to blue, gray, and eventually
reached its characteristic final wine-red color. The heating was stopped
and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature.

Synthesis of
Surfactant-Stabilized 32 nm AuNPs
Spherical CTAC-stabilized
AuNPs with an average particle size of ∼32 nm were synthesized
by a seed-mediated growth method.51 In
a 15 mL glass vial, 300 μL of a freshly prepared aqueous solution
of NaBH4 (10 mM) was added to 4.7 mL of an aqueous solution
containing HAuCl4 (0.25 mM) and CTAB (100 mM) under vigorous
stirring. After 2 min, stirring was reduced to a minimum and the CTAB-capped
Au cluster seeds were aged for 20 min at 45 °C. Then, in a 100
mL glass vial, 40 mL of a 0.5 mM HAuCl4 solution was added
in one shot to a solution containing 40 mL of CTAC (200 mM), 3 mL
of AA (1 M), and 460 μL of the aged CTAB-capped Au cluster seeds
at 300 rpm. After 15 min, the resulting ∼10 nm Au seeds were
centrifuged at 15 500 rcf for 20 min and washed with water.
After the second centrifugation (15 500 rcf, 20 min), the AuNPs
were redispersed in 10 mL of water for the following seed-mediated
growth step. Therefore, in a 500 mL glass vial, 200 mL of a 1 mM HAuCl4 in 50 mM CTAC solution was added dropwise (0.5 mL/min) to
a solution containing 200 mL of CTAC (50 mM), 260 μL of AA (1
M), and 5 mL of the 10 nm Au seeds. After 15 min, the resulting 32
nm Au NPs were centrifuged at 12 000 rcf for 20 min and washed
with water.

Seeded-Growth Synthesis of Citrate-Stabilized
71 and 84 nm AuNPs
Quasi-spherical citrate-stabilized AuNPs
with an average particle size of ∼71 and ∼84 nm were
synthesized by the citrate reduction-based seeded-growth method developed
by Puntes et al.(50) In
a 250 mL, three-neck round-bottom flask, 150 mL of a 2.2 mM aqueous
solution of sodium citrate was heated in an oil bath for 15 min under
reflux and vigorous stirring at permanent control of the solution
temperature. At 100 °C, 1 mL of a 25 mM HAuCl4 solution
was immediately injected, by which the color of the solution changed
from yellow to bluish gray and then to soft pink within 10 min. The
resulting citrate-stabilized AuNPs were used as seeds for the next
seeded-growth steps by successive addition of Au precursor, citrate
solution, Milli-Q water, and dilution steps as reported elsewhere.50 After 9 and 10 consecutive growth steps, the
citrate-stabilized 71 and 84 nm AuNPs were obtained, respectively.

Synthesis of Citrate/Tannic Acid-Stabilized 21 nm AgNPs
Citrate/tannic acid-stabilized AgNPs with an average particle size
of ∼21 nm were synthesized according to the sodium citrate/tannic
acid reduction method, which was reported by Puntes et al.(47) In a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, 100 mL
of an aqueous solution of sodium citrate (5 mM) and tannic acid (0.1
mM) was heated to boiling under permanent stirring. Immediately after
boiling, 1 mL of an aqueous 25 mM AgNO3 solution was injected
under vigorous stirring. After the reaction was finished, the heating
was stopped and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature.
The resulting AgNPs were purified (to remove the excess of tannic
acid) by centrifugation (10 000 rpm, 30 min) and redispersed
in an aqueous solution of 2.2 mM sodium citrate.

Protein-Coating
of NPs via Ligand-Exchange
The citrate-stabilized
or citrate/tannic acid stabilized satellite NPs were coated with different
proteins (BSA, BLG, CYTC, and CA) using a simple ligand-exchange process
that has been previously reported in the literature.39−41,43 For AuNPs, the pH of the protein–citrate
solution was adjusted to >9, for AgNPs to 9–9.5, respectively.
For this, 90 mL of the citrate-stabilized NP dispersions was added
dropwise to a 1 mg/mL protein/citrate solution under vigorous stirring.
After 24 h at room temperature, the protein-coated NPs were purified
(to remove excess protein) and concentrated by 5 centrifugation (8000–14 000
rpm, 0.5–4 h, depending on NP size) and redispersion cycles.
The CTAC-stabilized satellite NPs were coated with BSA. Thirteen milliliters
of the NP solution (CTAC concentration was set to 0.23 mM) was added
to 30 mL of a 10 mg/mL BSA solution (pH 8) containing 0.02 wt % trisodium
citrate under sonication. After 20 min sonication, the solution was
centrifuged at 12 000 rcf for 1 h and the concentrated NPs
were redispersed in one drop of a pH 11 NaOH solution and diluted
with 30 mL of a 1 mg/mL BSA solution (pH 10) containing 0.02 wt %
trisodium citrate. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the functionalized
NPs were washed 3 times at 12 000 rcf for 1 h with a pH 11.5
NaOH solution. The final dispersions were stored at pH ≥ 9
in a fridge.

Nanocluster Assembly
In a glass
vial, 500 μL of citrate-stabilized core NPs (5 × 1010 NPs/mL) was added dropwise to 250 μL of highly purified
and concentrated protein-coated satellite NPs (1 × 1014 NPs/mL). The pH of the satellite NP dispersion was adjusted to 10
before the core nanoparticles were added. After each addition step,
the mixture was vortexed for 10 s. The nanoclusters were purified
(to remove excess of satellite NPs) by 4 centrifugation (2000–3500
rpm, 5–12 min, depending on cluster size) and redispersion
cycles. After each centrifugation step, the quality of the supernatant
and the nanocluster dispersion were monitored via UV/vis spectroscopy. The final nanocluster dispersions were stored
at pH ≥ 10 in a fridge.

Optical Characterization
UV/vis spectra were acquired with an UV/vis spectrophotometer SPECORD
250 PLUS (Analytik Jena AG). The extinction at the wavelength of 400
nm (interband transitions),50 which is
assumed to have a size-independent absorption coefficient,61 was used to normalize the UV/vis spectra and
to calculate the molar concentration of Au(0) in the NP dispersions.
The molar concentration of Au(0) and the size of the nanoparticles
obtained from TEM images enabled the calculation of the particle concentration
(number of AuNPs per volume). The absorption and scattering losses
were determined using a UV/vis spectrophotometer Cary 5000 (Agilent
Technologies Deutschland GmbH) equipped with the external diffuse
reflectance accessory 2500 (integrating sphere). A quartz glass cuvette
was positioned at the center of the integrating sphere and a fixed
set of measurements was performed: sample measured without light trap;
sample measured with light trap; and Milli-Q water measured without
light trap as background. From this data, the absorption and scattering
losses were calculated (see Supporting Information).

Electron Microscopy
TEM images were obtained using
a TEM Zeiss CEM 902 (Carl Zeiss AG) with an accelerating voltage of
80 kV. SEM images were obtained using a SEM Zeiss 1530 (Carl Zeiss
AG) equipped with a field-emission cathode with an operating voltage
of 3 kV. Samples were prepared by spin-coating (2000 rpm, 30 s) of
the NP dispersions on silicon wafers (Sigma-Aldrich), cleaned with
Milli-Q water before use, and mounted on SEM aluminum pin stubs (Plano
GmbH).

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
SAXS experiments were
performed with a ‘“Double Ganesha AIR”’
system (SAXSLAB, Denmark). The X-ray source of this laboratory-based
system is a rotating anode (Cu, MicroMax 007HF, Rigaku Corporation,
Japan) providing a microfocused beam at λ = 0.154 nm. The scattering
data were recorded by a position-sensitive detector (PILATUS 300 K,
Dectris). To cover the range of scattering vectors between 0.026 and
2 nm–1, different detector positions were used.
The measurements were done in 1 mm glass capillaries (Hilgenberg,
code 4007610, Germany) at room temperature. The circularly averaged
data were normalized to incident beam, sample thickness, and measurement
time before subtraction of the solvent scattering curve.

Generalized
Multiparticle Mie Theory Simulations
The optical responses
of individual NPs as well as assemblies of NPs were modeled within
the framework of the generalized multiparticle Mie theory (GMMT) based
on analytic solutions for systems containing a finite number of ideally
spherical particles.62 For the GMMT calculations
in this work, an algorithm developed by Yu-lin Xu63,64 and Bo A. S. Gustafson65 as well as the
extension GMMFIELD by Moritz Ringler66,67 were employed,
using optical data by Johnson and Christy.68 GMMT simulated extinction spectra of single gold spheres in water
(refractive index n = 1.333) coincided with corresponding
experimental data (see Figure S14). The
presence of the protein coating was accounted for using a refractive
index of n = 1.395. Consequently, GMMT was used for
calculating the rotationally averaged extinction, absorption, and
scattering cross sections of core/satellite assemblies. The original
code by Yu-lin Xu was modified and extended to allow for parallelized
calculations employing the btrzx3 linux cluster (70 cores @ 2.8 GHz
with 4 GB RAM in total) at the University of Bayreuth. The high resource-efficiency
of the optimized code allowed us to screen a variety of nanocluster
configurations. The full ensemble of simulated spectra of nanoparticle
assemblies (containing up to 61 particles at core-to-satellite distances
ranging from 1 to 8 nm) with ideally symmetric and disordered satellite
distributions were obtained within 14 days of total calculation time.
Assemblies with ideally symmetric satellite distributions were modeled
as Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra. Assemblies with disordered
satellite distribution were modeled based on an algorithm following
a random sequential adsorption mechanism. To account for the assembly
variability, each morphological nanocluster species was represented
by an ensemble calculated from ten randomly assembled configurations.
