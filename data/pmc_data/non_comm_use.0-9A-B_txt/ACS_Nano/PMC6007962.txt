Additional functionalities on semiconductor
microchips are progressively important in order to keep up with the
ever-increasing demand for more powerful computational systems. Monolithic
III–V integration on Si promises to merge mature Si CMOS processing
technology with III–V semiconductors possessing superior material
properties, e.g., in terms of carrier
mobility or band structure (direct band gap). In particular, Si photonics
would strongly benefit from an integration scheme for active III–V
optoelectronic devices in order to enable low-cost and power-efficient
electronic–photonic integrated circuits. We report on room-temperature
lasing from AlGaAs/GaAs microdisk cavities monolithically integrated
on Si(001) using a selective epitaxial growth technique called template-assisted
selective epitaxy. The grown gain material possesses high optical
quality without indication of threading dislocations, antiphase boundaries,
or twin defects. The devices exhibit single-mode lasing at T < 250 K and lasing thresholds between 2 and 18 pJ/pulse
depending on the cavity size (1–3 μm in diameter).

==== Body
We recently entered the zettabyte
era; that is, the annual global Internet data traffic passed 1000
exabytes (1 billion terabytes). Until the year 2020 this number will
even increase to 2.3 zettabytes every year,1 however, at the expense of a drastically increased power consumption
of integrated circuits (ICs). Moreover, since 2016, the semiconductor
industry research plan is not centered on device scaling anymore, i.e., improving the chip performance followed
by the application. Thus, the integration of additional, value-added
functionalities on future silicon dies and reducing the power consumption
at the same time will be key for upcoming strategies, which will start
with the application defining the functionality of future Si-based
chips.2 This in turn will require the integration
of a large variety of devices such as amplifiers, ultralow power switches,
and especially optoelectronic devices on the very same Si substrate
to benefit from the maturity and low cost of the CMOS technology platform.
In particular, approaches including the usage of massless photons
instead of electrons for the data transfer on- and off-chip promise
higher speed at lower power consumption.3,4 In order to
shed light on Si chips and make such electronic–photonic integrated
circuits (EPICs) a reality, high-performance waveguides,5 modulators,6 and photodetectors7 in Si or group IV photonics have already been
developed. However, the deleterious impact of threading dislocations
introduced by the lattice mismatch between Si and III–V material
has strongly complicated the realization of coherent on-chip laser
sources being the last missing piece to enable fully integrated EPICs.
In this context, the most obvious solution would be to use group IV
materials, where Ge as well as its alloys with Sn plays a primary
role, due to the possibility to turn them into direct band gap semiconductors
and gain media.8−10 Very recently, direct band gap Ge1–xSnx epilayers with x < 0.13 and optically pumped GeSn laser devices were
demonstrated.11,12 However, electrically pumped
lasing at room temperature in direct band gap group IV semiconductors
is still rather challenging. III–V electrically pumped lasers
are well-established for telecommunication and other applications,
but the large-scale integration of III–V laser diodes on a
Si platform is hampered by various obstacles, although significant
progress was achieved in heterogeneous and monolithic integration
of III–V gain material on Si.13−17 Since traditional heteroepitaxy typically suffers
from large differences of the crystal lattices and thermal expansion—resulting
in defective layers—several techniques were developed in order
to suppress and/or confine the defective interface layer close to
the substrate and ensure a nearly defect-free device layer. This includes
the growth of thick buffer layers,18−21 nanowires,13,15 and/or masked substrates22 that leads
to a significantly reduced density of crystal defects and dislocations.
A promising integration path was recently demonstrated using selective
area growth in trenches22 and in prepatterned
V-grooves,23 which resulted in an optically
and electrically driven laser on Si(001), respectively. Another approach
is based on bonding of ex-situ fabricated III–V
photonic components,16 which recently made
significant progress regarding yield and device lifetime.24

In this paper, we present the monolithic
integration of III–V semiconductors for photonic devices on
Si, based on a selective epitaxial growth technique (template-assisted
selective epitaxy, TASE) that had been successfully developed for
nanoelectronic devices.25−28 The basic concept relies on the idea of a single
and small-area nucleation of the III–V material on Si—with
any substrate orientation—within hollow SiO2 template
structures of arbitrary shapes. This procedure allows for direct III–V
heteroepitaxy on Si without typical defects such as threading dislocations
or antiphase boundaries, avoiding the usage of thick buffer layers,
and, thus, could enable large-scale optoelectronics integration. A
necessity of adapting the TASE process to photonic devices, though,
is to increase the dimensions of the templates and resulting III–V
structures while maintaining the material quality. Here we report
on optimized template designs, fabrication steps, and active materials
compared to the nanoelectronics analogue25,29 and demonstrate the integration of AlGaAs/GaAs microdisk structures
as active photonic devices. Optically pumped lasing up to room temperature
is achieved along with temperature-stable lasing threshold and lasing
peak position.

Results and Discussion
Laser Fabrication
In order to monolithically
integrate III–V semiconductor gain material, we employ the
TASE growth technique presented and discussed elsewhere.25,26,30 This approach promises nearly
defect-free heteroepitaxy of III–V material on Si substrates.
As laser gain material GaAs with an AlGaAs cladding deposited by MOCVD
is used. The fabrication steps of the GaAs/AlGaAs microdisk devices
are illustrated in Figure 1. Standard Si(001) substrates are used and thermally oxidized
(approximately 130 nm SiO2 oxide thickness) to provide
a high refractive index mismatch between the GaAs (nGaAs = 3.6) and the surrounding medium (nSiO2 = 1.5), thus enabling a simulated cavity Q-factor of ∼730. Subsequently, holes (100 nm diameter)
were etched through the oxide using a CHF3/O2 reactive ion etching (RIE) dry etch process as shown schematically
in Figure 1a. Next,
an etch stop layer of 2–3 nm Al2O3 as
well as a sacrificial amorphous Si (α-Si) layer were deposited.
A 5 × 5 μm2 mesa structure centered on top of
the etched holes was patterned using e-beam lithography and an HBr/O2-based inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etch process (see Figure 1b). These squares
were covered with SiO2 (which is called a template in the
following) using atomic layer deposition (ALD, 20 nm) and plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, 120 nm), and four template openings
are defined and etched into the oxide as indicated in Figure 1c and d. The size and shape
of the openings ensure efficient precursor supply during growth while
mechanically stabilizing the hollow oxide template. Afterward the
sacrificial Si inside the templates and holes is etched (see Figure 1e) using XeF2. Prior to the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)
growth step (Figure 1f) the Al2O3 etch stop layer as well as the
native SiO2 were etched using BHF while forming a hydrogen
passivation on the Si surface. We grew two different samples for this
study; both growth processes start with GaAs growth at 600 °C
and a V–III ratio of 30 (sample A, 90 min; sample B, 30 min)
using trimethylgallium (TMGa) and tert-butylarsine
(TBAs) finalized with an AlGaAs/GaAs shell adding trimethylaluminum
(TMAl). Whereas microdisk devices from sample B are approximately
1 μm in diameter, cavities from sample A are typically 3 times
larger.

Morphological Analysis
In order to investigate the
crystalline quality, orientation, and the seed area, we cut out several
TEM lamellas from microdisk devices using Ga focused-ion beam (FIB)
etching at accelerating voltages of 30 and 5 kV. The samples were
investigated by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using
a double spherical aberration corrected JEOL ARM200F operating at
200 kV and equipped with a JEOL Dry SD100GV silicon drift detector
with 100 mm2 detection area for energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. The chemical maps obtained by EDX are
presented in the Supporting Information, Figure S1, while annular dark field (ADF) images are shown in Figure 2. For those images,
a convergence semiangle of 25 mrad was used in combination with an
ADF detector with inner and outer collection semiangles of 90 and
370 mrad, respectively. Images obtained with an ADF are shown in Figure 2, while EDX images
are presented in the Supporting Information, Figure S1.

sample B. The insets display the fast Fourier transform images from
the left and right segments as well as from the seed of the GaAs crystal.

In Figure 2a a cross-sectional STEM of a microdisk from
sample B is presented and a top-view scanning electron micrograph
(SEM) of the same device is shown in Figure 2b. This is the device on which we carried
out the optical characterization presented in Figures 4 and 5. The disk radius is approximately 1 μm, whereas its
thickness and the oxide thickness underneath amount to ∼335
nm and ∼140 nm, respectively. Following the various processing
and wet etching steps, the seed hole diameters are typically slightly
extended and measure approximately 120 nm. The contrast gradient across
(top to bottom) the GaAs region originates from a thickness variation
from the sample preparation. Moreover, several Ga residues are visible
as dark spots. The high-resolution ADF-STEM micrographs as well as
their fast Fourier transform images (insets of Figure 2a) reveal identical crystal orientation throughout
the entire III–V crystal, denoting monocrystalline growth without
amorphous or polycrystalline segments. Moreover, we do not observe
any crystal defects such as threading dislocations, antiphase boundaries,
or planar defects for this laser device. For this study we investigated
seven devices, and Figure S2 shows an example
of a nonlasing device. For in-depth planar defect analysis of TASE-grown
GaAs, we refer to our recent work.31 The
top-view SEM image (Figure 2b) shows well-defined facets. However, the entire crystal
is tilted by 8° and rotated toward the (11–2) plane, as
shown in Figure 2d,
compared to the Si substrate. We believe that this unexpected tilt
and rotation of the crystal might stem from a damaged Si surface from
RIE overetching, as evidenced by the noticeable Si recess in the seed
hole as well as the observation of defective crystals as shown in Figure S2.

Optical Characterization of the GaAs/AlGaAs/GaAs Microdisk Lasers
The microdisk resonators were optically excited using a pulsed
(15 ps pulse length every 10 ns) supercontinuum laser with center
wavelengths of 705 and 710 nm close to the expected laser emission
of the devices. The emission is collected from the top. A scheme of
the measurement procedure is illustrated in the inset of Figure 3c. According to 3D
finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations of the cavity field
decay using randomly oriented dipole emitters (see Supplementary Figure S4) and disk dimensions extracted from
the TEM results, a clear mode profile is established, as presented
in Figure 3a. The enhanced
reflectivity of the high-order mode supported by the 3 μm nanodisk
cavity32 and the high refractive index
mismatch between the GaAs nanodisk and the surrounding media results
in a simulated cavity Q-factor of 1650. Additionally,
2D mode simulations using a commercial Helmholtz equation solver (Lumerical)
show that a high-order (120) mode displayed in Figure 3b resembles the mode profile found with the
FDTD simulation using the random-dipole method. Figure 3c shows photoluminescence (PL) spectra with
a spectral resolution of ∼0.1 nm as a function of optical excitation
at 80 K for a 3 μm microdisk device. Whereas the spontaneous
emission dominating at low excitations is centered around 840 nm—being
in good agreement with the low-temperature GaAs band gap—whispering
gallery modes (WGM) appear above an excitation of 15 pJ per pulse.
The integrated PL intensity as a function of excitation—light-in
light-out (LL) curve—exhibits a clear kink along with a strong
line width reduction at a lasing threshold of 18 pJ/pulse (see Figure 3d). Another device
from sample A, shown in Figure 3e, exhibits lasing even up to room temperature with a similar
lasing threshold. The corresponding LL curve features a typical S-shape
behavior, which, accompanied by the strong line width narrowing, constitutes
a clear signature of the room-temperature lasing operation of the
device.

The temperature-dependent optical
characterization of a microdisk laser device from sample B is presented
in Figure 4. This monocrystalline
device (cf. Figure 2) is 1 μm in diameter with a thickness of approximately
335 nm. The excitation-dependent room-temperature as well as low-temperature
(10 K) PL spectra are displayed in Figure 4a and its inset, respectively. We found that
the lasing thresholds of these smaller devices extracted from the
LL curves (Figure 4b) are significantly lower (2.5–3.0 pJ/pulse) compared to
the values observed for devices from sample A. Comparing the lasing
thresholds measured for the 1 μm (2 pJ/pulse) and the 3 μm
(18 pJ/pulse) microdisks we find a ∼9× higher lasing threshold
for the large devices. As both devices are fabricated under the same
growth conditions, we expect similar material qualities. Therefore,
we conclude that either the different cavity confinement or simply
the 9× larger gain volume of the 3 μm disk is responsible
for the enhanced pumping energy required for the lasing operation
of the larger device. The FDTD simulations presented in Figure S4 show that the cavity Q factor of the 1 μm disk (Q = 1430) and Q factor of the 3 μm disk (Q = 1650)
are very similar. Since we optimized the laser spot size for the maximum
photoluminescence intensity for each of the devices, we assume a constant
excitation power per area for a given excitation laser power. Therefore,
we believe that the 9× higher lasing threshold measured for the
large device is mainly related to the scaling (9×) of the gain
material volume, which is in excellent agreement with our experimental
results. Remarkably, we observed that between 10 and 300 K the lasing
peak position moves only very slightly from 830 to 836 nm (see Figure 5a), whereas the peak
of the spontaneous emission follows Varshni’s law. Furthermore,
we observe single-mode operation without any mode hopping up to 250
K and attribute the maximum shift of the lasing mode, ΔλT = 6 nm, to the temperature-induced refractive index change.33 However, at room temperature, multimode lasing
operation with a free spectral range (FSR) of 20 nm as shown in Figure 4a is observed. Additionally,
as shown in the inset of Figure 4b, the lasing threshold is very insensitive to changes
of the lattice temperature and increases only marginally from 2.5
pJ/pulse to 3.0 pJ/pulse for a temperature increase from 10 K to 300
K, corresponding to an extremely high characteristic temperature of T0 = 1500 K, which is more than 1 order of magnitude
larger than for III–V quantum dot microdisk lasers.33−35 We believe that due to the small diameter of the device and, thus,
large FSR, only one (T < 250 K) or two modes (300
K) lie within the gain spectrum while providing sufficiently low cavity
losses to enable lasing. As can be seen in Figure 5a, the spontaneous emission curve exhibits
a very broad fwhm of ∼70 nm even at 10 K and shows a very strong
high-energy tail that extends far beyond 800 nm. This slow decay of
the high-energy tail cannot only be explained by thermal carrier activation,
which corresponds to kBT = 0.86 meV (0.5 nm) at 10 K and, therefore, is a clear signature
for an inequilibrium between the lattice temperature and the carrier
temperature in the gain material caused by, for example, electron–electron
collisions. However, as can be seen in Figure 5a, this strong spectral broadening of the
material gain is very beneficial for the temperature stability of
the device, as despite the Varshni shift and thermal depopulation,
the overlap of the material gain and lasing cavity mode remains high
if the temperature is increased.

Conclusion
In
summary, we demonstrated the monolithic integration of GaAs-based
microdisk lasers on Si using template-assisted selective epitaxy.
We developed a template process and design that enables the direct
epitaxy of monocrystalline, μm-large III–V microdisks
on Si(001) with high optical quality. The devices show unambiguous
lasing action up to room temperature with thresholds between 2 and
18 pJ/pulse depending on the cavity size. Thus, TASE-grown gain materials
and photonic devices on Si(001) represent a promising large-scale
integration path toward electrically actuated lasers for merging electronics
with photonics in order to reduce power consumption, i.e., via optical interconnects, and to enrich the functionality
of future Si ICs.

Methods
The
AlGaAs/GaAs growth was conducted in a Veeco P150 MOCVD system at 60
Torr using H2 carrier gas, TMGa, TMAl, and TBAs as precursors.
Prior to loading, the samples were etched in diluted hydrofluoric
acid (HF) in order to remove the native oxide on the Si seed surface
within the templates. Typical growth times were between 60 and 90
min. The dimensions of the AlGaAs/GaAs microdisks were measured after
growth by inspection in a Hitachi SU8000 SEM. For the optical characterization
of the microdisk lasers we used a home-built microphotoluminescence
setup. The samples were excited using a pulsed supercontinuum light
source with a repetition rate of 80 MHz and a typical pulse duration
of 10 ps, which was filtered to a 5 nm spectral window around 720
nm. In order to reduce the degradation of the structures subject to
the excitation light, we employed a chopper wheel to reduce the total
number of excitation pulses by a factor of approximately 40. To avoid
parasitic signals from the excitation source in the wavelength range
of the microdisk emission between 800 and 900 nm, we used a 750 nm
short-pass filter in the excitation path and a 750 nm long-pass filter
in the detection path. The excitation light was focused onto the sample
using a 50× Olympus objective, and the photoluminescence signal
was collected with the same objective mounted inside a He-flow cryostat
underneath a window opening, which provides optical access. The samples
were glued onto the coldfinger, which can be moved in the x- and y-direction using a closed-loop
piezo actuator stage. The objective can be moved in the z-direction using another piezo actuator to adjust the focus. The
photoluminescence spectra of the microdisks were recorded using a
liquid nitrogen cooled InGaAs line detector array with 1024 pixels
mounted to a spectrometer with a focal length of 500 mm and an 850/mm
grating. The photoluminescence signal is guided to the spectrometer
and focused to the entrance slit with a width of ∼25 μm.
An imaging system consisting of a halogen light source to illuminate
the sample, a 20 cm lens to focus the image of the sample onto a CCD
camera, a beam splitter to separate the two optical paths, and a semitransparent
pellicle to add the imaging system to the excitation and detection
paths was used to provide orientation on the sample and to record
images of the microdisk emission using a 750 nm long-pass filter in
front of the CCD. Samples for transmission electron microscopy were
prepared by means of a dual-beam focused FEI Helios Nanolab 450S FIB.
The samples were subsequently investigated by STEM using a double
spherical aberration corrected JEOL ARM200F operating at 200 kV equipped
with a JEOL Dry SD100GV silicon drift detector with 100 mm2 detection area for EDX analyses. ADF images were taken using a convergence
semiangle of 25 mrad in combination with an ADF detector with inner
and outer collection semiangles of 90 and 370 mrad, respectively.
