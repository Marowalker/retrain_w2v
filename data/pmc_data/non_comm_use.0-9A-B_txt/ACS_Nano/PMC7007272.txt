Coaxial
quantum wells (QWs) are ideal candidates for nanowire (NW)
lasers, providing strong carrier confinement and allowing close matching
of the cavity mode and gain medium. We report a detailed structural
and optical study and the observation of lasing for a mixed group-V
GaAsP NW with GaAs QWs. This system offers a number of potential advantages
in comparison to previously studied common group-V structures (e.g., AlGaAs/GaAs) including highly strained
binary GaAs QWs, the absence of a lower band gap core region, and
deep carrier potential wells. Despite the large lattice mismatch (∼1.7%),
it is possible to grow defect-free GaAs coaxial QWs with high optical
quality. The large band gap difference results in strong carrier confinement,
and the ability to apply a high degree of compressive strain to the
GaAs QWs is also expected to be beneficial for laser performance.
For a non-fully optimized structure containing three QWs, we achieve
low-temperature lasing with a low external (internal) threshold of
20 (0.9) μJ/cm2/pulse. In addition, a very narrow
lasing line width of ∼0.15 nm is observed. These results extend
the NW laser structure to coaxial III–V–V QWs, which
are highly suitable as the platform for NW emitters.

Semiconductor
nanowires (NW)
lasers provide strong optical mode confinement in a very small volume,
allowing laser diameters on the order of a few hundred nanometers
and length of a few micrometers.1−3 They hence provide small-size,
low-power devices with a wide range of applications. Moreover, III–V
NW structures can be grown on a Si platform,4−6 thus enabling
fabrication of high-quality photonic light sources for low-cost, ultra-high-density
integration, solving one of the major challenges currently limiting
the exploitation of Si photonics.7−11

While optically pumped NW lasers have been demonstrated,7,12−15 further reducing the threshold is critical for many applications
as well as realizing electrically injected devices.16,17 Threshold reduction can be achieved by confining carriers within
a nanostructure to benefit from the enhanced gain and improved temperature
stability;18,19 both quantum dots (QDs)15 and coaxial quantum wells (QWs)20 have been used as the gain medium. The use of coaxial QWs
is particularly attractive, as it allows a much larger effective volume
of gain material to be incorporated into the NWs, and the position
of the QWs can be easily tailored to strongly overlap with the cavity
mode.

There have been relatively few demonstrations of the use
of coaxial
QWs to reduce the threshold of NW lasers,21−23 with all reports
using III–III–V, common group-V material systems (e.g., AlGaAs/GaAs),24−30 which have some disadvantages associated with the challenges of
growing III–III–V core NWs. During the NW growth, the
vast majority of the group-III atoms diffuse from the substrate and
NW sidewalls to the growth front.31 Different
group-III elements have very different diffusion lengths, which are
also highly temperature sensitive. Therefore, there are large differences
in the optimal growth conditions for each species, especially in the
growth temperature.32,33 This makes the growth of III–III–V
NWs difficult, especially for the self-catalyzed growth mode.32,34 As a result, III–III–V NWs with QWs are commonly built
on binary core NWs. For example, AlGaAs/GaAs QWs use a GaAs core NW.
Due to the lower band gap of bulk GaAs compared to AlGaAs and the
GaAs QW, the core NW forms a lower potential region, which may trap
a large number of carriers (Supporting Information Figure 1a). Strong core emission has been observed in this
type of QWs, lowering the optical efficiency of the active region.35 Although GaAs NWs with InGaAs QWs do not have
a lower band gap core, and lasing from this system has been reported,36 it appears to be difficult to obtain deep electrons
and wells, even for high In compositions and hence significant strain.
In contrast, group-V elements do not have the diffusion-length issue
and III–V–V NWs can easily be grown with a large composition
range.37 Therefore, III–V–V
NWs with QWs can easily circumvent carrier trapping issues (Supporting Information Figure 1b). However, III–V–V-type
NWs containing coaxial QWs have not been studied in any detail, and
little is known about their basic structural, electronic, and optical
properties. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports
of lasers based on this type of structure.

Strong carrier confinement
by deep QWs is expected to be very important
given the high surface-to-volume ratio of the NWs and the close proximity
of the active material to the surface, which can have a high density
of carrier traps.38 Achieving deep confinement
potentials for both electrons and holes requires semiconductor pairs
with large band gap differences, but this can result in a high level
of strain. The small NW size may allow the accommodation of high strain
without the formation of dislocations, but there has been no study
to date of highly strained NWs containing QWs and their application
to lasers. A systematic and detailed study is thus needed, in particular
of the relationship between the QW depth, carrier confinement, and
lasing performance. If strained deep QWs can demonstrate their suitability
for NW lasers, this will greatly expand material choice, providing
more freedom in device design.

The ternary III–V–V
material, GaAsP, has a band gap
that covers wavelengths ranging from green (550 nm) to near-infrared
(860 nm) at room temperature.39 Consequently,
it is one of the most promising III–V compound semiconductors
for visible emitters. In this paper, we report a detailed structural
and optical study of strained GaAsP-based deep coaxial GaAs QWs and
demonstrate their suitability for NW lasers.

Results and Discussion
All NW samples were grown directly on p-type Si(111)
substrates by solid-source III–V molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
NW growth was initiated via Ga droplets deposited
on the Si substrate. Core–shell GaAsP NWs containing a single
GaAs coaxial QW were grown for initial structural and optical studies.
Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images show that
the first third of the NW length has a pure zinc-blende (ZB) structure
without stacking faults, the middle third is lightly twinned, and
the final third, toward the tip, is more defective (Figure 1a, Supporting Information S2). The diameter is relatively uniform but increases
slightly toward the tip, where the presence of stacking faults creates
new facets with higher surface energy, allowing faster shell growth.40 These stacking faults can be fully eliminated
by our recently developed modified growth, which produces defect-free
NWs.41 The GaAs0.62P0.38 NW core has a diameter of ∼50 nm (Figure 1b), and the GaAs QW is 3.5–10 nm thick,
confined by ∼18 nm GaAs0.54P0.46 barriers.
The QW width asymmetry is due to a shadowing effect during growth,
caused by the random positioning of neighboring NWs. This nonuniformity
can be seen in the emission spectra of some NWs, where multiple QW
emission peaks are observed. This nonuniformity, which is likely to
influence lasing performance, can be eliminated using patterned substrates
to give uniformly spaced NWs.4 Both QW
interfaces have a transition width of ∼1 nm (Figure 1c and d), which is much sharper
than typical AlGaAs/GaAs NW interfaces.30,42 Despite a
large compressive GaAs QW strain of ∼1.7%, no strain-induced
line- or loop-type dislocations are seen in the cross-section and
side views (Figure 1c and f).43,44 This absence of dislocations
is further confirmed by the fast Fourier transform filtered images
and strain mapping shown in the Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4.

These studies demonstrate that it is possible to grow highly
strained
coaxial QWs with excellent crystalline quality. The ability to apply
high levels of compressive strain to the GaAs QW should be advantageous
for lasing action due to the increased heavy-hole–light-hole
separation and the modification of the in-plane hole mass, which allows
a given gain to be produced by a lower carrier density.45 Reduced threshold currents for compressively
strained planar QW lasers have been demonstrated for a number of material
systems, but require the use of an alloy QW to achieve the desired
strain.46 The current NW system allows
the application of large compressive strains to potentially higher
quality binary GaAs QWs; this is not possible for planar growth on
a GaAs substrate.

The initial ∼2/3 of the NW has a uniform
composition (Figure 2a), and this is reflected
in the excellent spatial QW homogeneity (emission intensity, line
width, and central wavelength), as demonstrated by the highly uniform
cathodoluminescence (CL) emission (Figure 2b, c, and d). Within the first half of the
NW the QW emission is constant to within 3 nm (≡ 7 meV), followed
by a small initial blue shift of the CL emission beyond the midpoint
of the NW, suggesting a slight reduction of the QW width. No dark
spots are visible in the CL image (Figure 2d), consistent with the absence of dislocations
in the shell and QW. Comparison of CL and PL emission wavelengths
with NextNano simulations47 suggests a
QW width of ∼6.5–9 nm (Supporting Information S4), with the blue shift with respect to bulk GaAs
arising from a combination of quantum confinement and the 1.7% compressive
strain of the GaAs well. The energy separation between the lowest
QW states and the barriers is calculated to be ∼115 and ∼300
meV for electrons and holes, respectively. The tip of the NW has a
lower phosphorus composition (Figure 2a) and emits at a longer wavelength of >750 nm,
consistent
with the previous observation (Figure 1a) that the defective tip region has a faster growth
rate and hence a larger GaAs QW width. In addition, the emission at
the tip is much weaker, with the broad emission extending below the
bulk GaAs band gap, in accordance with the presence of defects.48

spectra recorded at 8 K along the NW length with constant spatial
increments. (c) Scanning electron microscope image and (d) CL intensity
mapping of the QW emission at 744 nm.

Micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) spectra are excited
by a 515
nm diode laser which is absorbed by the QW and also both the core
and barrier GaAsP. The NWs are mechanically transferred to a new Si
wafer and are studied normal to their length. The 300 K spectra of
a single NW (Figure 3a) are dominated by the QW emission, with the barrier emission only
weakly visible. No NW core emission is observed, despite this region
forming a potential carrier reservoir due to a lower P composition
and constituting ∼20% of the total NW volume (Figure 1b and c). This indicates very
efficient carrier transfer from the GaAsP regions to the QW. At 6
K the photoexcited carriers are much less mobile,49 and a very broad but weak emission is observed in the range
590–680 nm (Figure 3b) due to the QW barriers and NW core. The QW emission has
a narrow full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 6.9 nm (≡ 16
meV) and is ∼103 more intense than that of the GaAsP.
The ratio of the integrated QW emission (691–808 nm) to that
of the barrier and core emission (591–680 nm) exceeds 200 over
the temperature range 6–300 K for low excitation power (Figure 3c); this ratio increases
rapidly with excitation power (Figure 3d). The lifetime of the QW-confined carriers increases
with increasing wavelength (decreasing energy) (Figure 3e, Supporting Information S5), reflecting state filling and the transfer of carriers
from high to low energy states within the QW. The carrier lifetime
at the emission peak is ∼1 ns. An analysis of the temperature
dependence of the QW PL intensity, measured from an ensemble of NWs
(Figure 3f), indicates
a large barrier of 125 ± 12 meV against carrier loss (Supporting Information S6), which is consistent
with the calculated electron localization energy of 115 meV discussed
above. It is also found that carrier loss due to surface nonradiative
recombination is greatly reduced in the present structure (Supporting Information S6).

Our results demonstrate that the deep coaxial QWs act to
efficiently
capture photoexcited carriers, because the NW diameter (<200 nm)
is much smaller than the carrier diffusion length (in the micrometer
range).50,51 Captured carriers are strongly confined
by the deep QWs, resulting in extremely weak barrier emission at all
temperatures. In addition, the strong confinement inhibits carrier
loss to surface states (Supporting Information S6). As a result, the QW NW has a much stronger PL emission
(∼150×) compared to NWs with comparable morphology and
density but without a QW (Supporting Information S7 and Figure S8).

NWs with three coaxial QWs were grown
in order to provide the gain
required for lasing. The average composition of the NW core is GaAs0.38P0.62, and the barriers are GaAs0.53P0.47 (Figure 4a). The diameter of the NWs is ∼400 nm. Finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulations shown in Figure 4b show incomplete overlap between the QWs
and cavity mode. A pulsed laser, with a focused elliptical spot of
30 × 1.4 μm2, was used to excite the NW at 6
K. The excitation wavelength of 635 nm is only absorbed by the QW
and not the NW core or barriers. With increasing pulse energy, the
broad spontaneous emission shifts toward higher energy due to QW state
filling (Figure 4c).
Fabry–Pérot cavity modes at almost constant wavelengths
are observed, superimposed on the spontaneous emission. At high pump
energies, a small number of modes increase superlinearly with energy,
consistent with the onset of lasing (Figure 4d) at a threshold of ∼20 μJ/cm2/pulse. FDTD simulations indicate that only 4.4% of the incident
laser power is absorbed by the NW, which further reduces the absorbed
threshold flux to ∼0.9 μJ/cm2/pulse.

emission spectra for a sample temperature of 6 K. The inset shows
a lasing mode for excitation of 49 μJ/cm2/pulse.
(d) Double-logarithmic integrated output-power intensity of the lasing
mode versus incident pump pulse energy density.

The inset to Figure 4c shows the dominant laser
mode, which has a low line width of ∼0.15
nm (≡ 0.34 meV). This is narrower than the majority of previously
reported values for III–V NW lasers (typically >0.7 nm)7,14,15,20,52−57 and comparable to the lowest reported (resolution limited) value
of ∼0.25 meV.58 This suggests relatively
low levels of chirp in the current laser.

Three approaches should
further improve the performance of the
current coaxial QW lasers. The first is eliminating the defects, which
form at the tip of the NW and which may consume carriers by nonradiative
recombination, particularly at high temperatures. This should improve
the temperature performance, which, for the current structure, limits
lasing to below ∼100 K under our measurement conditions. Second,
due to unoptimized droplet consumption, the top facet has a low quality
(Figure 1a and inset
of Figure 2a). Improving
this will provide a higher quality optical cavity. Third, improving
the QW width homogeneity by growing the NWs on prepatterned substrates
will narrow the spectral distribution of the gain, allowing the threshold
gain to be reached for lower carrier injection.

Conclusions
In
summary, the properties of deep and highly strained GaAsP/GaAs
coaxial NW QWs have been studied. The QW is highly uniform along the
NW length for the region where the NW is defect free. Despite the
large compressive strain, no strain-induced dislocations are observed
in the QW region. The QW exhibits very efficient carrier collection
and strong carrier confinement, resulting in the PL being dominated
by the QW emission at all temperatures. In addition, carrier localization
in the QW appears to reduce the influence of surface states, further
contributing to the high radiative efficiency. A NW laser structure
containing three coaxial QWs demonstrates a very low external (internal)
threshold of 20 (0.9) μJ/cm2/pulse and a very small
lasing line width of ∼0.15 nm. The current system offers a
number of significant advantages compared to previously studied systems,
including deep electron and hole wells, a high compressively strained
binary QW, and the absence of a low band gap core, which can act as
a carrier sink. These initial results demonstrate that highly strained
III–V–V coaxial QWs are suitable for the fabrication
of low-threshold NW lasers, with a number of advantages compared to
more commonly studied systems.

Experimental Methods
NW Growth
The self-catalyzed GaAsP NWs were grown directly
on p-type Si(111) substrates by solid-source III–V
MBE.59 For the single QW NWs, the core
GaAs0.62P0.38 NW was grown with a Ga beam equivalent
pressure, V/III flux ratio, P/(As + P) flux ratio, substrate temperature,
and growth duration of 8.41 × 10–8 Torr, ∼40,
25%, ∼640 °C, and 1.5 h, respectively. After the growth
of the core, the Ga droplets were consumed by closing the Ga flux
and keeping the As and P fluxes open. Two GaAs0.54P0.46 shells were then grown with a Ga beam equivalent pressure,
V/III flux ratio, P/(As + P) flux ratio, substrate temperature, and
growth duration of 8.41 × 10–8 Torr, 50, 50%,
∼550 °C, and 30 min, respectively. A ∼10 nm GaAs
QW was grown between the two GaAsP shells, with a Ga beam equivalent
pressure, V/III flux ratio, substrate temperature, and growth duration
of 8.41 × 10–8 Torr, 60, ∼550 °C,
and 10 min, respectively. For the three-QW sample, the core GaAs0.38P0.62 NW was grown with a Ga beam equivalent
pressure, V/III flux ratio, P/(As + P) flux ratio, substrate temperature,
and growth duration of 8.41 × 10–8 Torr, ∼30,
41%, ∼640 °C, and 1.5 h, respectively. After the droplet
consumption, the three GaAs QWs and three GaAs0.53P0.47 barriers were grown with same condition as that of the
single QW sample, except that the growth time was 1 h for each barrier.
Finally, shells of Al0.5Ga0.5As0.53P0.47 (30 min) and GaAs0.53P0.47 (20 min) were deposited. The final NWs have a diameter of ∼400
nm and an as-grown length of 9.4 μm. During growth, the substrate
temperature was measured by a pyrometer.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
Simple mechanical
transfer of the NWs onto a lacey carbon support was used to prepare
TEM specimens. The cross-section samples were prepared by embedding
the NWs in a low-viscosity resin and slicing using a microtome. The
TEM measurements were performed with JEOL 2100 and doubly corrected
ARM200F microscopes, both operating at 200 kV.

Cathodoluminescence
Imaging was performed on both NWs
still attached to the substrates and also broken off and transferred
to a Si substrate. The studies were carried out in a dedicated SEM
at a temperature of 8 K, using an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and
a probe current of 25 pA. The detector was a Si-CCD. CL measurements
shown in Figure 2c
were performed using a Gatan MonoCL3 system within a Zeiss Supra 55VP
SEM operating at 3 kV.

Photoluminescence
Large-area PL
measurements (Figure 2b) probe a high number
of NWs and is relatively insensitive to movement of the laser spot,
which tends to occur as the temperature is varied. Excitation is by
a 532 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser, with a 0.25 m monochromator
used to disperse the PL, which is detected by a TE-cooled Si detector.
μ-PL spectra were obtained from single NWs, which had been removed
from the original substrate and transferred to a new Si wafer. μ-PL
spectra of single NWs were excited by a cw 515 nm diode laser. The
time-resolved PL of the single QW sample and the pumping of the MQW
laser sample was performed using a pulsed 635 nm diode laser with
a repetition frequency of 80 MHz and 80 ps pulse width. The samples
were measured under vacuum inside a continuous flow cryostat (base
temperature 6 K). The incident laser was focused with a 20× long
working distance microscope objective to a spot size of ∼1
μm diameter. The resultant PL was collected by the same microscope
objective and focused into a 0.75 m spectrometer, where the spectral
components were resolved and detected using a 300 l/mm grating and
a nitrogen-cooled CCD. The spectral resolution was ∼0.5 meV,
and higher resolution measurements were recorded using an 1800 lines/mm
grating with a resolution of 0.09 meV. The time-resolved PL was detected
by a silicon APD and a photon counting card. The resolution of this
system was ∼100 ps.

FDTD Simulations
FDTD simulations
were performed using
Lumerical FDTD Solutions, with a custom source (free-space wavelength
of 635 nm, elliptical Gaussian beam with an fwhm of 1.3 and 30 μm
along orthogonal directions). The source was injected perpendicular
to the nanowire and substrate (200 nm SiO2 covered Si).
The nanowire structure was modeled from the cross-sectional TEM image,
with a complex refractive index value for the GaAs QW (3.85 + 0.192i)
and no absorption for the GaxAsP1–x barriers (3.6 + 0i). A fine mesh (2 nm resolution)
was used to resolve the multiple QW heterostructure. Field monitors
were used to record the field in the nanowire cross-section, and the
fraction of pump power absorbed was calculated from the net power
transmission through a box of monitors surrounding the nanowire.
