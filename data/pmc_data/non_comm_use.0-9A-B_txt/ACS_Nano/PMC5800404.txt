Crystal
defects in highy luminescent colloidal nanocrystals (NCs)
of CsPbX3 perovskites (X = Cl, Br, I) are investigated.
Here, using X-ray total scattering techniques and the Debye scattering
equation (DSE), we provide evidence that the local structure of these
NCs always exhibits orthorhombic tilting of PbX6 octahedra
within locally ordered subdomains. These subdomains are hinged through
a two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) network of twin boundaries through
which the coherent arrangement of the Pb ions throughout the whole
NC is preserved. The density of these twin boundaries determines the
size of the subdomains and results in an apparent higher-symmetry
structure on average in the high-temperature modification. Dynamic
cooperative rotations of PbX6 octahedra are likely at work
at the twin boundaries, causing the rearrangement of the 2D or 3D
network, particularly effective in the pseudocubic phases. An orthorhombic,
3D γ-phase, isostructural to that of CsPbBr3 is found
here in as-synthesized CsPbI3 NCs.

==== Body
The wide
interest in semiconducting
lead halide perovskites originated initially from the outstanding
photovoltaic performance of hybrid organic–inorganic [CH3NH3]PbX3 or [CH(NH2)2]PbX3 (CH3NH3+ = methylammonium (MA), [CH(NH2)2]+ = formamidinium (FA), X = Cl, Br, I or mixture thereof) exhibiting
power conversion efficiencies above 22%.1−4 More recently, fully inorganic CsPbX3 in the form of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) or supported
nanostructures has demonstrated bright room-temperature photoluminescence
(PL) and potential for applications in light-emitting devices,5−11 PL down-conversion in display technologies, and remote phosphors12,13 as well as in photovoltaics.14−18 The PL is characterized by narrow emission line widths (full width
at half maxima, fwhm = 12–42 nm, smaller for blue, larger for
red NCs), high PL quantum yields (QY, 50–90%), and short radiative
lifetimes (1–29 ns),5,19 making these NCs a
viable alternative to well-established CdSe- and InP-based semiconductor
NCs.20−23 The latter NCs, also known as colloidal quantum dots, are wavelength-tuned
primarily through quantum-size effect that is via ultraprecise size- and shape-controlled synthesis. In CsPbX3 NCs quantum confinement is also strongly pronounced,24,25 but apparently plays a rather minor practical role for controlling
the band gap energy and thus the emission color. Instead, compositional
tuning via inexpensive one-pot synthetic processes—through
the formation of Cl/Br and Br/I solid solutions—enables highly
accurate adjustment of their band gap energies through the whole
visible spectral region (410–700 nm).19,26 Another fundamental asset of perovskite NCs stems from the so-called
defect tolerance, shared by all Pb-halide perovskites: common defects
such as vacancies, grain boundaries and surfaces do not introduce
midgap trap states.27−30 Hence, bright PL is achievable without the necessity for the electronic
surface passivation needed with wider-gap materials, as usually required
for conventional, defect-intolerant CdSe, InAs, or InP NCs, typically
coated with epitaxial shells of CdS or ZnS.20,22

In spite of this exciting scenario, there is still a lack
of knowledge
of the important structural aspects of the crystal defects.31−34 The recent “renaissance” of halide perovskites has
stimulated extensive experimental and theoretical studies,35,36 mostly on bulk samples (single crystals and microcrystalline powders
of CsPbX3 and of their hybrids),37−40 aiming at clarifying the crystal
structure of the different (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic) polymorphs,
their stability ranges and transition conditions from one another
upon external stimuli (temperature and pressure),34 and the role of the structural disorder, either static
(vacancies, nanodomains or twin defects) or dynamic (thermal vibrations
and fluctuations of octahedra) on the electronic properties.41−45

In small NCs, with sizes down to just a few nm, the inherently
reduced extension of the coherent domains results in very broad Bragg
peaks and a large amount of diffuse scattering, which makes the structural
analysis of NCs by diffraction techniques far more complex than in
the bulk. In the case of CsPbX3, this limitation also makes
challenging the correct identification of the stable crystal modification,
even at ambient (or operational) conditions, and has resulted in conflicting
conclusions in the recent literature.5,6,46−48 Another factor is the similarity
of the atomic arrangements in the various polymorphs of the CsPbX3 family, which result in very small differences of the X-ray
diffraction patterns and are practically indistinguishable by the
other common characterization techniques such as high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) unless special in-line holography techniques
are used.49 Indeed, the cubic polymorph
was initially assigned to all CsPbX3 colloidal NCs, on
the basis of a qualitative inspection of laboratory powder diffraction
patterns and HRTEM analysis, resulting in a size-dependent structural
stabilization of this polymorph being proposed.5 Presently, to the best of our knowledge, quantitative structural
investigations on as-synthesized perovskite CsPbCl3 and
CsPbI3 NCs are missing, whereas there is a general consensus
on assigning the orthorhombic phase to CsPbBr3 NCs at room
temperature (RT), at least to describe the average crystal structure.47 However, a more intricate and exciting picture
is indeed taking shape. Very recent low-frequency Raman spectroscopy
and inelastic X-ray scattering experiments (both requiring single
crystals), providing evidence of polar fluctuations in the high-temperature
(HT) cubic phase of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3, suggest
that these structures are highly dynamic and appear cubic on average
while fluctuating among (locally) noncubic structures.44,45

Overall, this scenario suggests that defining the atomic arrangement,
including crystal defects, is not trivial in this important class
of perovskite NCs; extensive diffraction-based studies specifically
addressed to investigate these aspects at the nanoscale are missing,
and the potential impact of these defects on the peculiar functionalities
of these materials is not fully understood.

In this work we
present a precise investigation of the structural
defectiveness of highly luminescent CsPbX3 NCs prepared
following the synthesis of Protesescu et al.,5 using a joint Debye scattering equation (DSE)/atomic
pair distribution function (PDF) approach.50,51 Through an advanced atomistic modeling of synchrotron wide-angle
X-ray total scattering data relying on the DSE, we here provide clear
evidence that such defectiveness results from the formation of orthorhombic
subdomains (occurring both in the room and high-temperature phases)
hinged through a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) network
of twin boundaries across which the coherence of the Pb sublattice
is preserved throughout the whole NC. We also show here that the as-synthesized
CsPbI3 NCs studied in this work, highly luminescent in
red and commonly assumed to be ideal cubic,5 are isostructural with the well-known orthorhombic γ-CsPbBr3 phase.47

The DSE-based method
yields information about crystal structure,
defects, size distribution, and morphology from polycrystalline samples,
within a unifying, physically based and quantitative modeling framework.
Through a real-space atomistic model of NCs, it provides a simulation
of the diffraction pattern, which can be further optimized against
the experimental data (details are provided in the Supporting Information). The method utilizes the information
from the entire scattering signal, properly modeling non-Gaussian
line-shapes and diffuse scattering effects, and goes well beyond the
conventional Rietveld-based method that focuses only on information
from Bragg peaks. It is suitable for studying short-range (nanoscale)
structural correlations, either in an ordered or disordered state.
The PDF method also utilizes both Bragg and diffuse scattering to
yield information about the local structure, but the data are Fourier
transformed to, and modeled directly in, real-space.51 Data suitable for a PDF analysis are collected over a wide
range of momentum transfer, Q, and often are of low
resolution in reciprocal space and as such provide complementary data
to the high Q-resolution, limited Q-range data used for the reciprocal-space DSE methods. Both DSE-based
and PDF analyses have been successfully applied in the past decade
for the structural and microstructural characterization of nanoparticles
and nanostructured materials, including lead chalcogenides and hybrid
halide perovskites.52,53

Our total scattering DSE-based
structural characterization of CsPbX3 NCs presented hereafter,
performed both in their pristine
colloidal and dry states (powders or gels), also includes the analysis
of the NCs size and morphology and is further supported by Rietveld,
PDF and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis.

Results and Discussion
In CsPbX3 perovskites, Pb atoms lie at the nodes of
a (pseudo)cubic lattice and are octahedrally coordinated by the halides,
whereas Cs ions rattle near the center of the cube. Owing to the high
flexibility of the PbX6 octahedra-based framework in 3D
and depending on the size of the halide, CsPbX3 perovskites
may exhibit the archetypal cubic structure or lower symmetries, mainly
resulting from the tilting of the octahedra implying bending of the
Pb-X-Pb angles from the ideal 180° value. As schematically summarized
in Figure 1, tilts
may involve halides in the equatorial plane only
(Xeq, leading to a tetragonal modification, P4/mbm) or simultaneously in the equatorial plane
and along the normal axial direction (Xax, leading to an orthorhombic modification, Pbnm or,
equivalently, Pnma). We here refer to the nomenclature
adopted in previous studies, indicating the cubic, tetragonal, and
orthorhombic structures as the αβ and γ-phase, respectively.34 At ambient conditions in the bulk, the thermodynamically
stable polymorphs are perovskite structures (3D connectivity of corner-sharing
PbX6 octahedra), with cubic (though debated) for X = Cl
and orthorhombic for X = Br symmetries, and for X = I a nonperovskite
orthorhombic polymorph (δ-phase, 1D connectivity of edge-sharing
PbX6 octahedra, with a wider energy bandgap; PL inactive).
Transitions from the α forms to the lower symmetry modifications
are observed progressively upon cooling;34 the ensuing distortion of the 3D framework through octahedral tilting
is reported also to induce fragmentation of the crystals into several
domains and formation of twin boundaries.54 Considering that CsPbX3 NCs are synthesized at T > 100 °C, the occurrence of these kinds of defects
may be possible and can influence the NCs optical and electronic properties;54 nevertheless, their detection and investigation
by electron microscopy are not trivial, also due to the samples instability
under the electron beam.49

Analysis of the Average Crystal Structure
in CsPbX3 NCs: Evidence of Multiple Anomalies
In order to clarify
the proposed model, we first focus on some peculiar experimental evidence
of the diffraction patterns observed at RT and upon heating or cooling.
High-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns of CsPbX3 NCs (Figure 2) were collected at 298 K either on colloidal solutions (green lines,
in hexane or toluene, the scattering signal of the solvent is here
subtracted), for each halide or on dry samples (red lines, powders
or gels). Dry samples of CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 were also measured at low- and high-temperatures (LT, blue lines;
HT, brown line), below and above the reported phase transition values,
and data were fruitfully used for the comprehension of their structure
defectiveness, which remains the main focus of this work.

Figure 2 (a) X-ray synchrotron
total scattering data showing changes of
superstructure peaks in CsPbX3 NCs at RT and upon phase
transitions; simulations (dashed lines) vs experimental
traces (solid lines) in the 1.5–2.2 Å–1Q range for (b) CsPbI3, (c) CsPbBr3, and (d) CsPbCl3. The starred (narrow) peak in
panels (a) and (d) corresponds to the 101 reflection of contaminant
ice (Ih phase).

The diffraction traces underwent
a data-reduction procedure, mandatory
for a reliable total scattering DSE-based analysis, aiming at subtracting
all extra sample scattering contributions and applying absorption
corrections (details are given in the SI). These data have been used for both Rietveld and DSE analyses.
Such a strict control of all experimental conditions makes the determination
of isotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) more reliable than
from conventional powder diffraction measurements, their detailed
analysis suggesting the manifestation of subtle structural effects.
Note that the anisotropic ADP model was not considered, as diffraction
data from nanosized materials (particularly with X-rays) do not provide
robust information; therefore in the following, ADPs refer to isotropic
values (in the form of Debye–Waller factors), even when not
specifically said.

Significantly, Figure 2a shows (for some of the measured data) that
the most intense
diffraction peaks match the nominal Bragg positions of the cubic polymorphs
in all CsPbX3, but that a few weak superstructure peaks, the most representative appearing in the 1.5–2.2 Å–1Q region (within boxes), are present,
providing a fingerprint of PbX6 octahedral tilts taking
place in both CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 at RT. A visual
inspection of these peaks (Figure 2b–d) and their qualitative comparison with the
pattern simulations of the expected polymorphs (dashed lines) in the
same 1.5–2.2 Å–1Q region,
apparently pinpoints the cubic phase in RT CsPbCl3 and
HT CsPbBr3 (Figure 2c,d) and also displays some unexpected deviations in CsPbBr3 at 298 K (both dry and colloidal NCs). Rietveld analysis,
performed on LT, RT, and HT data in analogy with that reported for
RT CsPbBr3 nanopowders,47 did
not provide any significant improvement in terms of average crystal
structure(s) (the solely accessible by conventional crystallographic
methods) compared to those available in the current literature for
the corresponding bulk materials (numerical results appear in Tables 1 and S1–S3). However, subtle anomalies emerged
therefrom, which were also observed in a parallel analysis by the
DSE approach upon using the same ordered structural
models provided by the Rietveld method (see Methods and Supporting Information for details).
In most cases, pattern matching was partially unsatisfactory, resulting
in unexpected misfits both in position and intensity of many peaks,
particularly evident for the RT CsPbCl3 and HT CsPbBr3 NCs with the cubic model (Figures S1 and S3). In both cases, the 100 peak (Q ∼
1.1 Å–1) exhibits an asymmetric shape suggesting
a low-symmetry splitting; moreover, an accurate analysis of the peak
positions for these two samples (Figure S2), obtained by unconstrained profile fitting procedures,
showed that reflections with even (h2 + k2 + l2) values are distributed around a well-defined cell parameter
(5.618 Å for CsPbCl3 and 5.866 Å for CsPbBr3, respectively), whereas the odd ones are
significantly shifted away with an unphysical cell parameter inflation
of up to 0.07 Å. These findings clearly suggest, independently
of the adoption of any structural model and refinement (Rietveld/DSE)
technique, a noncubic lattice metric for both samples.
These results all point to a lower-than-cubic symmetry for the NC
structures, despite of the lacking of the superstructure peaks commented
above.

b Colloidal sample.

In this regard, very interesting
is the analysis of the isotropic
ADPs reported in Table 1. Anomalous high ADPs of Cl (10.13 Å2) and axial
Br (7.14 Å2) and I (5.21 Å2) ions
(i.e., those connecting the PbX6 octahedra along the c-axis) were obtained
in the cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phases, respectively, indicating
high structural disorder. These values, derived by Rietveld refinement,
were confirmed by the DSE analysis based on the same ordered structural
models. The anomalous behavior of the ADPs of Cl at RT is indeed nearly
ubiquitously reported for the bulk material and interpreted as local
displacements in the cubic structure (or by a strongly anharmonic
potential well).55 Resorting to a disordered
cubic model with the Cl position refined to ∼0.5 Å away
from the original one (Figure 3a,b) resulted in more physically reasonable ADPs (Table 1) with a marginal
improvement in the fit (Figure 3c). Note that the Cs+ values are not affected.
Indeed, the high ADP value(s) for Cs+ is attributed (in
the NCs and in the bulk) to rattling of the cations within the cuboctahedral
cavities, being Cs+ slightly too small than the ideal value
(the Goldschmidt tolerance factors are 0.85 < τ < 0.87
for the I/Br/Cl CsPbX3 NCs).56 The split-Cl cubic model (with four equivalent displaced sites,
each contributing with 25% probability) suggests a severe distortion
of the PbCl6 octahedra, which can be mitigated by lowering
the crystal symmetry. In this view, there are numerous spectroscopic
(NMR, NQR, and EPR) studies addressing the inequivalence of Cl ions
in RT bulk CsPbCl3, consistent with an orthorhombic disposition
of PbCl6 octahedra.57,58 However, such a low
symmetry modification, were it ordered over long-range, would conflict
with our experimental data which clearly do not show any extra peaks
in the 1.5–2.2 Å–1Q region. This is clearly visible in Figure S3, where the DSE best fits based on ideal defect-free NC populations
are shown. Moreover, this phase modification and even lower symmetry
structures were unable to recover the 100 peak splitting (Figure S3). Therefore, a different explanation
for the apparent cubic structure in our RT CsPbCl3 NCs is needed. Interestingly, the HT cubic phase in our CsPbBr3 NCs behaves in a similar way than the Cl-based cubic perovskite
(isotropic ADPs of Br are 11.0 Å2 and 2.06 Å2 in the cubic and split-cubic models, respectively, Table 1 and Figure S3); this finding is in line with the highly dynamic
distorted local structure reported for the HT bulk phase.45

and methods of analysis. (e) DSE best fit corresponding to orthorhombic

2D projections of the undistorted orthorhombic structure; and (i)
sketch of the cooperative rotations of PbCl6 octahedra
at the twin boundaries as a viable mechanism of the dynamically changing

Our low- and high-temperature
synchrotron X-ray scattering measurements
of CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 NCs provide the clue
for a viable interpretation, which is fully supported by a DSE modeling
based on defective (polytwinned) NCs and reinforced
by the systematic comparison of this with the corresponding defect-free
DSE model (Table S4). Since the size of
the halide influences the temperature at which the apparent cubic
structure is observed, we first illustrate our interpretation and
the ensuing modeling for CsPbCl3 NCs.

Toward a Model
of Coherent Nanotwins. The Case of CsPbCl3 NCs
We were inspired by a thorough single-crystal
neutron diffraction study in which an anomalous (but not understood)
rise of Cl ADPs was found upon cooling below 400 K, whereas a linear
increase is restored in the HT regime (i.e., >400 K, well above the claimed tetragonal-to-cubic
transition
temperature, TC, of 320 K).59 Rietveld analysis of data collected on our powdered
CsPbCl3 at four different temperatures down to 133 K (performed
upon adopting the ordered cubic model to make meaningful comparisons
with the above-mentioned study, see Table S2) showed the same anomalous LT rise of Cl, whereas Cs and Pb ADPs
lower, as they should, upon cooling (Figure 3d, filled symbols). As increasing ADPs at
LT do not come from harmonic thermal vibrational effects, the peculiar
temperature dependence of atomic thermal vibrations in CsPbCl3 indicates that, already at T > TC, and below TC,
deviation
from the cubic symmetry progressively increases, boosting the “orthorhombic
character”. Altogether these findings suggest that “orthorhombic”
subdomains may form in our NCs, giving rise to a multiply twinned
structure, as already theoretically proposed and experimentally confirmed
by optical microscopy and 133Cs NMR studies on bulk CsPbCl3.60−62

In order to investigate such a possibility
by DSE-based diffraction methods, we studied the effects of twin boundaries
on the diffraction pattern of halide perovskite NCs, assuming the
RT orthorhombic structure (isostructural to the γ-CsPbBr3)47 for the nanodomains. We considered
the case of coherent twins that maintains unperturbed the Pb sublattice
of the orthorhombic phase. Indeed, owing to the fact that we are playing
with randomly oriented powder-like materials, incoherent twin boundaries
(as those reported in the single crystals case)54 are expected to influence the size distribution of coherent
domains (discussed later on) without introducing other diffraction
features. With reference to the appropriate terminology, we investigated
the combination of different {hkl} slip planes, ⟨hkl⟩ slip directions and magnitudes of the shift
(k) (summarized by the k ⟨hkl⟩ {hkl} formalism, including
symmetry equivalencies, in the orthorhombic frame). As detailed in
the SI, through these combinations, a selective
control of the intensity of the orthorhombic superstructure peaks
is achieved, depending also on the hkl reflection
indices (Figure S4). Figure 3f exemplifies the location of a single (110)
slip plane (as observed in a number of oxide perovskites),63 acting along the [−110] slip direction
(blue arrows) with k = 1/2 (a magnitude of half the
lattice vector along the same direction is required). When a network
of 1/2⟨110⟩{110} twin boundaries is inserted in a single
NC (with the slip direction always lying within the slip plane), the
corresponding atomistic model results in the arrangement of multiple
coherent subdomains, as shown in Figure 3g. Using the DSE approach implemented in
the Debussy Suite,64 we generated a population
of twinned NCs of prismatic shape and increasing size (as detailed
in the Methods) that results in an apparently
cubic diffraction pattern (Figure 3e and inset) with an improved matching of the experimental
data compared to the (DSE-based) split-cubic model (GoF = 10.1 vs 12.1). The enlarged portion of the NC in Figure 3g shows the 2D atomistic details
at the twin boundary in comparison to the untwinned orthorhombic structure
(Figure 3h). A large
density of twin boundaries is necessary to obtain this effect, suggesting
that the density of defects increases upon temperature increase (in
CsPbCl3 from LT to RT), whereas a self-healing process,
enlarging the orthorhombic subdomains, should happen upon cooling.
A viable mechanism of formation and dynamic migration of these boundaries
is sketched in Figure 3i, which locally modifies the arrangement of (ideally undistorted)
PbX6 octahedra through cooperative (in and out-of phase)
rotations.65 These synchronized movements
may flip (part of) the domains modifying their relative sizes and
orientations (by 90° one to each other).

Nanotwins in Room- And
High-Temperature Phases of CsPbBr3 NCs
Inspired
by the case of CsPbCl3,
we investigated the existence of orthorhombic subdomains in CsPbBr3 NCs, aiming at explaining the apparent cubic (HT) and tetragonal
(RT) phases observed in the X-ray synchrotron data (Figure 2c). The results of this modeling
are graphically summarized in Figure 4. The slip plane still belongs to the {110} family
in all cases;63 a single twin boundary
per NC along the ⟨001⟩ slip direction with k = 1/2 (Figure 4b)
is sufficient to obtain the features of the tetragonal pattern (Figure 4a), suggesting that
our experimental observation can be interpreted as a slight deviation
from the plain orthorhombic structure. In contrast, polydomain NCs
combining 1/2⟨110⟩{110} and 1/2⟨110⟩{001}
(Figure 4d) are necessary
for obtaining a “cubic-like” pattern (Figure 4c), in which the orthorhombic
superstructure peaks vanish. Again, upon increasing the temperature,
the number of defects increases, and the twinned orthorhombic model
very well matches the experimental data, as witnessed also by the
statistical indices: GoF = 2.26 compared to 3.07 for the cubic model.
In contrast, the low density of defects in the RT data makes the two
models (orthorhombic, defectless, and twinned) rather competitive
in terms of numerical statistical indicators (GoF = 2.08 vs 1.99, respectively). We have collected a number of HRTEM images,
but owing to the sub-Å scale of the (rotation-induced) halide
offset at the domain interface, twin boundaries cannot be observed
(Figure 4e). To further
support the hypothesis of nanotwins in RT CsPbBr3 NCs,
we performed PDF analysis.

CsPbBr3 NCs at 298 K (a) and at 410 K (c); the green traces
draw the DSE best fits corresponding to the poly twinned orthorhombic
models shown in (b) and (d), respectively. These models cause the
vanishing of many peaks resulting into an apparent tetragonal (a)
or cubic pattern (c). (e) BF-STEM image of CsPbBr3 NCs

High-energy (67 keV) scattering data were collected
at 28-ID-2
beamline at NSLS-II (Brookhaven National Laboratory) on the powdered
sample and targeted to the investigation of the short vs medium order range through the atomic PDF (Figure 4f).44 We found
that the proposed orthorhombic structure fits reasonably well the
low r region up to 26 Å (Rw = 12.9% vs Rw = 18.5% obtained with the tetragonal structure),
whereas a tetragonal description has to be preferred in the 26–70
Å range (Rw = 10.9% vs 12.4%, details in SI). Interestingly,
interoctahedra Pb–Pb peaks in Figure 4f are much narrower than expected, whereas
Pb–Br peaks are broader, indicating a more ordered arrangement
of the Pb network and the discontinuity of halide sublattice at the
twin boundaries. More details about the PDF analysis, including the
separate partial contribution of the different pairs to the total
PDF signal, are provided in Figure S5.

The Crystal Structure of CsPbI3 γ-Phase in
NCs
We here report on the 3D perovskite structure of the
as-synthesized colloidal CsPbI3 NCs studied in this work.
These CsPbI3 NCs do not belong to the known thermodynamically
stable (but PL inactive) 1D-, δ-phase, yellow in color.34 Instead, they share very similar structural
features with the distorted perovskite phases discussed above, at
least for the RT phase. As the bulk single crystals and thin films,
our NCs synthesized at higher temperatures in a 3D-, red-luminescent
phase are metastable, eventually turning into the 1D-phase. This transition
takes from several days to several months, depending upon the surface
treatment and storage conditions.34

In contrast to recent reports on the stabilization of the cubic α-phase
at RT,66 X-ray synchrotron data collected
on our colloidal CsPbI3 NCs show four distinct peaks not
compatible with either the α- (Figure 5b) or the δ-phases (Figure 5c). The occurrence of a new
orthorhombic polymorph is established here, which is isostructural
with the well-known γ-CsPbBr3 phase. The refined
coordinates are given in the SI. The DSE
best fit shown in Figure 5a corresponds to the untwinned orthorhombic structure. For
the newly identified γ-phase, neither (apparent) cubic- nor
tetragonal-like X-ray diffraction patterns were ever observed in repeated
syntheses, therefore we consider the formation of multiple twinning
in CsPbI3 NCs at RT a much less severe occurrence, easily
explained by the larger ionic radius of I. Nevertheless, the presence
of residual misfits in the superstructure peaks (Figure 5a), and the relatively high
value of Iax ADPs (see Table 1) suggest that, also in this case, a minor
fraction of NCs may not be single domain. Needless to say, the proposed
defective model holds also for cubic CsPbI3 NCs (Figure S6), of which experimental data on HT
phases could not be collected.

Figure 5 (a) DSE best fit of X-ray synchrotron
data (λ = 0.49544310
Å) collected on as-synthesized CsPbI3 NCs corresponding
to the orthorhombic γ-phase. DSE simulations of the α-phase
(b) and δ-phase (c) are shown for comparison.

A Generalized Model of Coherent Nanotwins in CsPbX3 NCs
Altogether, we envisage that CsPbX3 NCs
contain nearly ordered γ-phase subdomains, separated by a network
of twin boundaries, denser at high temperatures and maintaining unchanged
Pb locations. Their mutual orientation may lead to an “apparent”
higher-symmetry (tetragonal or cubic) structure on average, while
keeping the tilted “orthorhombic” arrangement of PbX6 octahedra at the length scale of the subdomains.

Why
this occurs can be explained by a simplified model, in which N domains (of volume Vi) hinge about 2D interfaces of area Aij (i,j running
on the domain sequence), with ΔHo and ΔHc being the molar formation
energies of the orthorhombic and cubic phases, respectively. As evidenced
by DSC measurements, ΔHo < ΔHc, the orthorhombic structure being favored
at low temperatures.67 By introducing the
surface tension γij relative to
the ij interface,68 the
(practically identical) crystal densities ρo and
ρc, and the pertinent formula weight (fw), the overall
enthalpy of a polytwinned NC can be approximated by  which, if γij values are low enough, may be lower than the single
cubic domain
value of VNC volume:  

However, since the creation of boundaries contributes to increase
the overall free energy by a positive term proportional to N1/3 (see SI for details),
entropic contributions (proportional to N and different
in sign) may result in temperature-dependent stabilization. Accordingly,
the progressive subdivision into ordered subdomains becomes entropically
favored at HT. The formation enthalpy of the boundary network creation
reduces the network at LT and increases the sizes of the orthorhombic
domains; differently, at higher T, the negative term associated with
the entropy increase (∝N) more than compensates
the energy needed to create many new boundaries. Therefore, within
this model, the presence of truly cubic domains becomes unnecessary.

As reorientation of the PbX6 octahedra may be very easy
(with practically no activation energy), the “phase transitions”
at the nanoscale are here interpreted by the insurgence of networks
of twin boundaries of different density and dimensionality rather
than changes of the symmetry of the average crystal structure. Lowering
the temperature from the HT phase would therefore appear as a progressive
lowering of the interfacial energy, very much as it occurs in the
foam coarsening process.

This finding may have important implications
on understanding the
optical and electronic properties of halide perovskite NCs (Figure S7). In contrast to the reported observation
of the lack of change in the PL peak position of CsPbBr3 NCs upon temperature-induced phase transitions,21 we found that the PL of polymer-encapsulated CsPbBr3 NC films monotonically decreases with heating from RT up
to 100 °C (Figure S8). During heating,
the wavelength blue-shifts, with an increase in the band gap in line
with the values of other lead-based semiconductor materials.69 The smooth changes in the PL intensity and maximum
position with temperature are almost reversible, exhibiting a behavior
consistent with a temperature-induced lattice expansion. This finding
goes well with the persistence of tilted octahedra in an orthorhombic-like
arrangement within the subdomains above the expected “phase
transitions” and with the ∼1% in volume lattice expansion
(in the 298–410 K range) found for the CsPbBr3 NCs
of this work.

The disappearance/appearance of weak superstructure
peaks upon
heating/cooling further suggests the dynamic (rising and self-healing)
processes within twin-boundary modifications. Since our diffraction
methods cannot catch transformations on a picosecond time scale, no
direct observation of the dynamic rearrangement of the nanotwins is
possible. Nevertheless, our findings are well in agreement with the
very recent report on the intrinsic dynamic disorder in lead halide
perovskites (in the high temperature cubic modification), as emerged
from inelastic X-ray scattering on hybrid (CH3NH3PbX3) and from the compared study of hybrid and full-inorganic
CsPbBr3 crystals through Raman scattering and first-principles
molecular dynamics.45 Of relevance is the
suggestion that the low charge carrier mobility and recombination
in these materials may be influenced by such strong dynamic disorder.

Within the more general theme of correlated disorder, emerging
as one of the most exciting challenges of modern crystallography,70 the dynamic rearrangement of the nanotwins leading
to an apparent higher symmetry on average also suggests similarities
with the nondisplacive phase transition model recently proposed for
BaTiO3.71 However, in BaTiO3, an equivalent effect emerges from correlations of the local
symmetry-breaking distortions related to the off-centering of Ti ions
(leading to a rhombohedral local structure), whereas halide perovskites
NCs feature the tilts of PbX6 octahedra (resulting in an
orthorhombic local structure). Despite of these analogies, the two
models are clearly material dependent and not interchangeable. With
reference to the ABX3 general formula of perovskites and
according to a classification based on the purely geometric Goldschmidt
tolerance factor, the distortions in CsPbX3 and BaTiO3 differ in that they are B-site (τ > 1) and A-site
(τ
< 1) driven,72 respectively, the tolerance
factors being all below 1 for CsPbX3 and τ = 1.06
for BaTiO3.56,72 Moreover, A-site driven lattice
distortions are prevalently observed in nonferroelectric perovskites,
which is also the case of CsPbX3 NCs. Indeed, differently
from ferroelectric BaTiO3, dielectric measurements show
that CsPbCl3 is neither ferroelectric nor antiferroelectric;73 electric polarization has been detected in hybrid
halide perovskites, owing to the presence of the polar molecule in
the cuboctahedral cages, whereas a spherical cation like Cs+ in the highly isotropic environment of the A- site will not.32

As a final remark, the nanotwin model
proposed for CsPbX3 NCs does not account for the asymmetry
of the lowest-Q peak (100 in the cubic notation),
which is observed in most measured
data (visible in Figures 3e and 4a,c). This finding suggests
the possible occurrence of additional defectiveness, of second order
with respect to the one here discussed, requiring further investigations.

Morphology and self-assembly of CsPbX3 NCs
The
morphological characterization of the CsPbX3 NCs investigated
here by the DSE analysis (in their colloidal state, using the 298
K data) provided a more detailed and variegated picture compared to
the simplified cubic representation emerging from the 2D projections
in TEM images (Figure 6a). Although morphological details on NCs facets are not introduced
in the DSE modeling (such a level of shape information being lost
in the experimental wide-angle X-ray data), the capability of the
DSE approach of combining atomic-scale details of the crystal structure
with the NCs shape description enables the identification of the longest
and shortest sizes with reference to the crystallographic axes. This
is a relevant issue in anisotropically elongated (nanorods) or flattened
(nanoplate) particles. Such information is typically achieved by TEM
analysis, as long as an appropriate orientation of the crystals is
possible. However, distinguishing nearly identical interatomic distances
in the cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic polymorphs of CsPbX3 NCs by HRTEM is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity
of the technique, making the method inapplicable in this case.49 We further consider that even SAXS analysis,
that does not possess atomic-scale resolution, cannot provide such
information, which definitely makes the DSE approach an extremely
useful tool for the morphological characterization (in terms of a
quantitative statistical distribution) for this class of materials
at the nanosized regime. A bivariate growth model was applied here
for characterizing all the CsPbX3 NCs; in the orthorhombic
case this approach is a good approximation of the much more complex
but more appropriate triaxial model. The graphical outcome of the
DSE best fit for CsPbBr3 and its bivariate log-normal size
distribution are shown in Figure 6b. Average sizes and size dispersions along the two
growth directions are provided in Table 2 for the three colloids. Being number-based
values, they are directly comparable to TEM-based average sizes. For
CsPbBr3, we performed a statistical analysis of the two
edge sizes in the faces exposed in TEM images, which included ca. 100 particles. The averages over the longest (10.8 Å)
and the shortest (8.9 Å) edges cannot be directly compared with
the DSE sizes (in the absence of oriented NCs and knowledge of the
third dimension); however they can be reasonably taken as limiting
values. The single average of all edge lengths from TEM is indeed
in very good agreement with the diameter (Deq) of the sphere of equivalent volume of the prismatic particles used
in the DSE model (9.87 Å vs 9.84 Å). This
also indicates how reliable are the DSE estimates given in Table 2. CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 exhibit comparable size and monodispersity
(<20%), whereas smaller particles are found in CsPbCl3 with relatively large size dispersion. On the morphological side,
CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 NCs appear slightly elongated
in the c-axis (aspect ratios are 1.4 and 1.2, respectively),
whereas CsPbI3 is slightly flattened along the same crystallographic
direction.

SAXS-based values are also provided.

SAXS analysis of colloidal CsPbCl3 and
CsPbBr3, performed in diluted solutions, showed the interesting
and unexpected
tendency of NCs to self-assemble in a stacked sequence, as often observed
in nanoplates in concentrated solutions.74 The model (see details in SI) provides
the size of the chain cross-section (quoted in Table 2) and the number of stacked beads, with much
longer strings formed in CsPbCl3 (>50 spheres) than
in
CsPbBr3 (6 ± 0.8). Interestingly, the cross section
of the string nicely matches the base size of the prism in the DSE
model, suggesting that the particle alignment might occur through
the {001} facets. Whether, and how, ligands drive this assembly needs
further investigation.

Conclusions
We have proposed an
original depiction of the structural defectiveness
in CsPbX3 NCs that goes beyond the classical vision of
the average crystal structure and better complies with the flexibility
of halide perovskites NCs upon halide changes and temperature variations.
This characterization was possible through high-resolution synchrotron
X-ray total scattering data and an advanced modeling performed through
the DSE. The DSE enables the crystal structure and the NC morphology
to be simultaneously treated within a coherent approach, providing
a powerful tool for characterizing these complex materials. Future
work will be addressed to other systems, such as hybrid organic–inorganics
and mixed halides, in view of better understanding the structural
features behind the outstanding properties of this class of perovskite
NCs.

Methods
Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs
The CsPbX3 NCs were
prepared according to our previous
report.1 A 25 mL 3-neck flask was loaded
with octadecene (ODE, 5 mL) and PbX2 (0.188 mmol) such
as PbI2 (0.087g, ABCR, 99.999%), PbBr2 (0.069g,
ABCR, 98%), and PbCl2 (0.052g, ABCR, 99.999%), and the
mixture was dried under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C. Dried oleylamine
(0.5 mL, OLA, Acros 80–90%) and dried oleic acid (OA, 0.5 mL)
were injected at 120 °C under N2. After complete solubilization
of a PbX2 salt, the temperature was raised to 180 °C,
and Cs-oleate solution (0.4 mL, 0.125 M in ODE, prepared from 0.814
g Cs2CO3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), 40 mL ODE, 2.5 mL
oleic acid, under vacuum, at 120 °C) was quickly injected, and
5 s later, the reaction mixture was cooled by the ice–water
bath. For CsPbCl3, a higher temperature of 150 °C
and 1 mL of trioctylphosphine (TOP, Strem, 97%) are required to solubilize
PbCl2. The obtained crude solutions were centrifuged for
4 min at 12 krpm, and the precipitate was redispersed in 3 mL of toluene.
The solution was further centrifuged at low speed (4 krpm), and the
supernatant was filtered and concentrated under vacuum for the measurements.

Characterization of CsPbX3 NCs
CsPbX3 NCs were characterized by a combination of: scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM), steady-state PL, and wide (WAXS) and small
angle (SAXS) X-ray scattering techniques. STEM was performed on a
JEOL 2200FS TEM/STEM microscope. A Fluorolog iHR 320 Horiba Jobin
Yvon spectrofluorimeter equipped with a PMT detector was used to acquire
the steady-state PL spectra from solutions. The SAXS data were collected
using a NanoSTAR instrument from Bruker AXS,75 equipped with a liquid metal jet source from Excillum AB, Sweden,
and with home-built scatterless slits.76 A home-built flow-through quartz capillary sample cell was used
for the measurements. Details on the SAXS data modeling are provided
in the Supporting Information. WAXS synchrotron
data were collected on colloidal and dry samples at the X04SA-MS Powder
Diffraction Beamline of the Swiss Light Source of the Paul Scherrer
Institut (Villigen, CH) with 25 and 22 keV beam energies in the 0.5–130
2θ range, using a single-photon counting silicon microstrip
detector (MYTHEN II).77 LT and HT measurements
were performed through a temperature controller N2 stream
fluxing over the capillaries.

The high-energy X-ray WAXS data
of CsPbBr3 (as dry powder) for PDF analysis were collected
at the 28-ID-2 XPD beamline at National Synchrotron Light Source II
(NSLS-II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY, USA). The
measurements were performed at RT using a X-ray energy of 67 keV.
Details on atomic PDF data analysis are supplied in the Supporting Information.

The DSE Method
According to the DSE-based approach
implemented in the DebUsSy program suite,64 atomistic models of prismatic NCs were built by stacking a building
block (the atoms of the unit cell of the appropriate polymorph) along
two independent growth directions, one lying in the ab-plane and the second one parallel to the c-axis
(details can be found in the Supporting Information, section 3). In the case of defective clusters, the proper slip
system was added to the orthorhombic model, by shifting the atoms
according to the required twin law: k ⟨hkl⟩ {hkl}, where k is the magnitude of the shift, ⟨hkl⟩
is the direction (including all the symmetry equivalent ones), and
{hkl} is all the equivalent family of the planes
of the twin boundary (see Supporting Information, section 4). In order to speed up the calculation of the total scattering
pattern through the DSE, sampled interatomic distances, instead of
the true ones, were computed from the population of NCs of different
sizes.78

Model parameters were then
optimized against the experimental data. These include structural
(isotropic atomic thermal displacement parameters, ADPs) and microstructural
parameters (according to a bivariate log-normal distribution function
with four adjustable parameters, namely average sizes and standard
deviations along the two independent growth directions) to properly
describe the NCs size and shape distribution.

Preparation of Polymer-Encapsulated
CsPbBr3 NC Films
Twenty μL of toluene solution
of CsPbBr3 NCs (10
mg/mL) were mixed with 200 μL of toluene solution of poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA, molecular weight: 350 kDa, concentration 5%)
and drop casted on a precleaned glass slide.

Temperature-Dependent PL
Measurements of Polymer-Encapsulated
CsPbBr3 NC Films
The optical emission was recorded
by an optical fiber coupled CCD spectrometer (LR1-T from ASEQ-instruments,
1 nm spectral resolution). A CW laser diode with a wavelength of 405
nm and a power of 3 mW was used as the excitation source. The emitted
light was measured using long-pass filters (FEL450, Thorlabs). In
order to avoid photodegradation effects, the sample was exposed to
the laser beam only during 200 ms per each measurement, while during
the remaining time it was kept in the dark. The temperature was controlled
by a custom-built setup consistent of a heater with Arduino microcontroller
board. The speed of heating up and cooling down was set to be 5 °C
per minute. Spectra were smoothed in order to avoid noise impact before
taking the maximum position.
