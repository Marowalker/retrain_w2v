It
is becoming accepted that ultrathin dielectric layers on metals
are not merely passive decoupling layers, but can actively influence
orbital energy level alignment and charge transfer at interfaces.
As such, they can be important in applications ranging from catalysis
to organic electronics. However, the details at the molecular level
are still under debate. In this study, we present a comprehensive
analysis of the phenomenon of charge transfer promoted by a dielectric
interlayer with a comparative study of pentacene adsorbed on Ag(001)
with and without an ultrathin MgO interlayer. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy and photoemission tomography supported by density functional
theory, we are able to identify the orbitals involved and quantify
the degree of charge transfer in both cases. Fractional charge transfer
occurs for pentacene adsorbed on Ag(001), while the presence of the
ultrathin MgO interlayer promotes integer charge transfer with the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital transforming into a singly occupied
and singly unoccupied state separated by a large gap around the Fermi
energy. Our experimental approach allows a direct access to the individual
factors governing the energy level alignment and charge-transfer processes
for molecular adsorbates on inorganic substrates.

Thin dielectric
layers on metals
form the basis for many applications such as semiconductor microelectronics,
corrosion protection, or data read-out (magnetic tunnel junctions),
but are also of interest in fundamental research. On the one hand,
various potentially interesting phenomena can arise from the reduced
thickness and the variability of composition and structure in the
ultrathin regime, leading to drastically changed chemical and physical
properties compared to the corresponding bulk-like analogs.1,2 On the other hand, the possibility to simply electronically decouple
adsorbed species from the metallic substrate has allowed fundamental
atomic and molecular properties, such as the imaging of orbitals and
the charge-state switching of atoms and molecules by scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM)3−5 or the observation of giant magnetic anisotropy and
long magnetization lifetime of single atom magnets,6 to be studied. However, thin dielectric layers on metal
surfaces can play a far more active role than mere decoupling or passivating
layers. Large changes in work function (WF) induced by the dielectric
can change the electron energy level alignment for adsorbates such
that charge transfer is promoted.7,8 This phenomenon
can have important consequences in fields ranging from catalysis to
organic electronics.9−13

The basic concepts of energy level alignment at, and of charge
transfer across, the interfaces are generally understood. As the interaction
between adsorbates and (large band gap) dielectrics is in general
weak, the dominant charge-transfer mechanism from the substrate through
the dielectric into the adsorbate is tunneling, in which case the
transferred charge is expected to be integer. This has to be distinguished
from fractional charge transfer, which occurs in strongly coupled
(hybridized) systems, e.g., for
adsorbates in direct contact with a metal. However, the quantification
of transferred charge is challenging, both theoretically and experimentally.
For instance, the degree of calculated charge transfer is strongly
dependent on the functional used and on the computational scheme employed
to quantify charges in density functional theory (DFT) calculations.14 Experimentally, while the presence of charged
species can be inferred from optical spectroscopy or STM,4,15,16 it cannot be quantified. Ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) can give direct access to charge-transfer
states. However, without unambiguous identification of emission features
to orbitals, charge transfer is difficult to infer, and without an
understanding of the photoemission angular distribution, until now,
it is impossible to quantify.17 Moreover,
from the properties known for the isolated substrate and adsorbate,
which typically are the WF of the substrate and the electron affinity
(EA) and ionization potential (IP) of the adsorbate, one can generally
not conclude whether or not charge transfer will occur. Additional
contributions that govern the energetic position of the molecular
orbitals upon adsorption, and usually come hand-in-hand, are the polarizability
of the substrate and Pauli repulsion (push-back effect).18 While the former reduces the gap between frontier
orbitals (increasing EA and decreasing IP), the push-back effect reduces
the WF of the system and thereby the overall energy level alignment.19

In the present work, we aim at an experimental
quantification of
both charge transfer across interfaces and energy level alignment
at interfaces characterized by strong and weak electronic coupling.
To this end, we use as a model the organic semiconductor pentacene
adsorbed on pristine Ag(001) and the same substrate covered by an
ultrathin dielectric layer, respectively. The atomic structure and
the shape of the frontier orbitals of adsorbed pentacene (5A, C22H14) (Figure 1a) have already been experimentally resolved with atomic
force microscopy and STM, respectively.3,20−22 STM in particular allows the frontier orbitals to be identified.
This often requires that the molecule is electronically decoupled
from the metallic substrate, which can be achieved, for example, by
adsorbing 5A on ultrathin NaCl layers grown on Cu(111).3 This substrate system exhibits a comparably high
WF and the molecule remains uncharged on the surface. Herein, we study
the integer charge-transfer state of 5A, which is spontaneously formed
by occupation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of
5A on the electronically decoupling, low-WF substrate system of ultrathin
MgO(001) films on Ag(001) (Figure 1b). We compare the charging behavior of 5A on this
substrate with the charge transfer on 5A/Ag(001) without dielectric
interlayer and will show that the presence of the dielectric, at first
glance counterintuitively, promotes charge transfer to 5A. Moreover,
we will present direct evidence for integer charge occupation of the
LUMO by imaging orbitals in real and reciprocal space via STM and photoemission tomography, respectively, which enables us
to unambiguously identify the singly occupied (SOMO) and the associated
unoccupied (SUMO) molecular orbital of the molecule.

Results and Discussion
Charge
Transfer into Pentacene
As the WF prior to adsorption
of the molecule is the principal driving force for the charge transfer
to the molecule, and the final WF after adsorption depends on the
degree of charge transfer to the molecule, an indication about the
charge flow can be obtained from WF changes (Table 1). Upon adsorption of a full monolayer (ML)
5A, the WF of the bare Ag(001) surface, 4.3 eV, is decreased by 0.4
eV. This change arises from the reduction of the WF by the push-back
of the electrons spilling out from the Ag(001) surface (Pauli repulsion),
which is partly compensated by the dipole induced by charge transfer
to the molecular layer.

For a 2 ML thin MgO
film on Ag(001), our measurements confirm previous
theoretical and experimental results,23−25 showing a 1.7 eV reduction
of the WF upon dielectric film formation. The large reduction in WF
is due to the push-back, which is uncompensated as there is no significant
net charge transfer to the MgO layer. Subsequent adsorption of a full
monolayer of 5A on MgO(001)/Ag(001) leads to an increase of the WF
by 1.2 eV. This increase can be explained by charge transfer and the
corresponding induced dipole caused by the presence of negatively
charged molecules on the MgO surface. Note that the final WFs of 5A/Ag(001)
and 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001) are essentially the same, suggesting Fermi
level pinning in both cases.26

The
observed WF changes (Table 1) support the idea of spontaneous charging of 5A by
occupation of 5A’s LUMO upon adsorption on 2 ML MgO(001)/Ag(001).
To gain molecular information about the adsorption and charging of
5A on Ag(001) and MgO(001)/Ag(001), the systems were analyzed with
STM. Figure 2a shows
a representative STM image of a submonolayer coverage of 5A on bare
Ag(001). The 5A molecules are in general very mobile on the metallic
substrate at 77K, as indicated by the noisy appearance of the image.
Only occasionally clusters of stable, immobile molecules were found
on flat Ag(001) terraces (e.g.,
four molecules forming the cross on the upper right corner, and the
cluster of six molecules on the left side in Figure 2a) and at step edges. Upon increasing the
coverage of 5A on Ag(001) to a full monolayer, the molecules are immobilized
in ordered domains with their long molecular axis aligned parallel
to the principal [110]/[11̅0] directions (Figure 2b). Note that the molecules usually appear
as rod-like protrusions in both filled- and empty-state images. Occasionally,
orbital-like structure was resolved on these surfaces, possibly when
the STM tip got unintentionally functionalized with a 5A molecule.

STM images of submonolayer coverages of 5A molecules on 2
ML MgO(001)/Ag(001)
thin films are shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. In contrast to clean Ag(001), the molecules
are immobile, even at submonolayer coverage. They are again aligned,
because of the [100]/[100] epitaxial relationship between Ag(001)
and MgO(001), with their long axis parallel to the principal [110]/[11̅0]
directions, i.e., along the closed-packed
Mg/O rows of the film. The molecules display a distinct orbital-like
structure at the bias voltages applied. All 5A molecules feature a
7-lobe structure, clearly resembling the LUMO of isolated 5A (Figure 1a),3 when imaged at Usample ≈1
V both below (Figure 3a) and above EF (Figure 3b). Representative STS spectra (Figure 3c) reveal the presence
of two states at Usample = −0.8
V and Usample = +0.9 V, which both have,
according to the images shown in Figure 3a,b, LUMO-like character. Observation of
the LUMO shape below EF proves charge
transfer into the 5A molecules, while the appearance of the LUMO above EF indicates that the LUMO is not fully occupied.
One would naturally conclude from this result that the two states
observed in STS correspond, respectively, to the singly occupied (SOMO,
below EF) and its associated unoccupied
(SUMO, above EF) molecular orbital state
of the molecule. At this point, we have to mention that qualitatively
comparable results have been reported for a neutral Au–5A complex
created on 3 ML NaCl/Cu(111), where similar submolecular structures
are observed above and below EF. However,
there the splitting was attributed to temporary charging and discharging
of the neutral molecule by the STM tip.27

Since STM alone obviously does not allow to unambiguously
conclude
the electronic structure of the system, we performed ab initio calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT)
and additional photoemission imaging and spectroscopy experiments
to gain further insight into the charge rearrangement, electronic
structure, and energy level alignment of the 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001) (and
5A/Ag(001)) interface.

DFT Calculations
Two types of calculations
were considered:
one for 5A adsorbed on Ag(001) and MgO(001)/Ag(001), utilizing the
VASP code,28,29 and another one for gas-phase
5A, using the NWChem package.30

On
both surfaces, the calculations confirm the experimental findings
of the molecules being aligned along the [110]/[11̅0] substrate
directions and of charge transfer into the molecules. First, consider
the situation for 5A adsorbed on clean Ag(001). The 5A molecule adsorbs
on-top of the closed-packed Ag row with the central benzene unit centered
on a Ag atom (Figure 4a) and a calculated adsorption energy of 2.65 eV/molecule. Information
about charge transfer and charge rearrangement upon adsorption is
gained from the charge density differences shown in Figure 4b and the projected density
of states (PDOS) plotted in Figure 4c. Similar to 5A adsorbed on Ag(110),31 the energetic position of the molecular LUMO falls onto EF (Figure 4c), indicating charge transfer into 5A and partial
occupation of the LUMO. This can also directly be seen in the charge
density difference plot, which indicates that charge accumulation
(red) at the molecule occurs at locations that resemble the shape
of the LUMO (Figure 4b, horizontal cut). However, there is also considerable charge depletion
(blue) from the molecule, which shows that deeper lying molecular
orbitals donate charge to the molecule–substrate bond.32 The strong Pauli repulsion between the π
electrons of 5A and the electrons of the Ag substrate is represented
in the vertical cut in Figure 4b by the charge depletion layer directly above the topmost
Ag atoms. The excellent agreement between experimental and calculated
WFs for this weakly hybridized molecule–substrate system (Table 1) strongly suggests
that the calculation correctly reproduces the effects of charge transfer
and push-back in this system.

differences induced by 5A adsorption on the Ag(001) substrate. The
arrows indicate where the horizontal cut has been made. Red shows
accumulation and blue depletion of charge, respectively. (c) PDOS

visibility. In addition, the projections on the molecular orbitals
are shown for LUMO+1 (cyan), LUMO (blue), HOMO (red), HOMO–1
(orange), and HOMO–2 (dark green).

We now turn to 5A on the 2 ML MgO(001)/Ag(001) films. Here,
the
most stable adsorption configuration is flat-lying on top of the oxygen
rows (Figure 5a). In
contrast to the bare Ag(001) surface, where potential barriers <0.1
eV for the lateral movement of 5A have been calculated, the potential
barriers are increased by 0.6 eV on the MgO thin film. This immobilization
can be understood when considering the calculated charge density differences
depicted in Figure 5b. These show an accumulation of charge beneath the benzene rings,
directed toward the Mg2+ ions beneath the molecule. Thus,
there is a strong dipolar contribution to the bonding, and the molecule
gets locked into the positions of the cations. Note that this is also
reflected in the considerably enhanced adsorption energy of 4.71 eV/molecule
compared to 5A/Ag(001) (2.65 eV). The substantially increased diffusion
barrier is in accordance with STM observations of reduced mobility
of submonolayer coverages of 5A on MgO(001)/Ag(001) compared to Ag(001)
(at 77 K).

cuts showing the charge density differences induced by 5A adsorption

depletion of charge, respectively. (c) Spin-resolved PDOS obtained
for the 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001) interface using the HSE functional. The

for better visibility. In addition, the projections on the molecular
orbitals are shown for LUMO+1 (cyan), LUMO (blue), HOMO (red), HOMO–1
(orange), and HOMO–2 (dark green).

The charge density difference plot (Figure 5b) also shows a charge accumulation above
the molecular backbone, which again resembles the shape of the molecule’s
LUMO, and naturally suggests charge transfer into the LUMO. Note that
the calculated WF change resulting from the charge rearrangement in
the system upon 5A adsorption is in good agreement with the experimentally
determined WF change (Table 1). In addition, we mention that the presence of the charged
5A molecule induces similar effects in the MgO layer as other charged
species, e.g. Au, including the
buildup of a polarization in vertical direction (as seen in Figure 5b) and a polaronic
distortion of the MgO lattice, which is a necessary factor for the
stabilization of charged species above the dielectric film.33,34

The spin-resolved density of states calculated using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE) functional,35 corresponding to the
situation discussed above, is shown in Figure 5c. Clearly, and in contrast to the 5A/Ag(001)
system, a distinct spin split of the former LUMO states (blue lines)
below and above the Fermi level is observed. Consequently, the two
states, which both have the shape of the LUMO, can be assigned as
SOMO and SUMO states. As such, the PDOS further supports the conclusion,
drawn from the experimental results, of charge transfer into 5A. However,
the energy gap of 0.8 eV between the two spin states is undoubtedly
underestimated due to the incorrect asymptotic behavior of the HSE
potential. Note that this problem is far worse when using a standard
GGA functional, which results in the LUMO straddling EF with an almost imperceptible difference between spin-up
and spin-down energies.

In order to obtain a better estimation
for the SOMO–SUMO
gap, we have calculated the electronic structure of an isolated molecule
using an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OT-RSH) functional.36 OT-RSH calculations are known to be useful for
correcting the severe underestimation of gaps between occupied and
unoccupied states inherent in DFT calculations.36−38 For neutral
5A, the calculated EA and IP of 1.4 and 6.3 eV (gap 4.9 eV)38,39 are in good agreement with gas-phase experimental results of 1.4
and 6.6 eV (gap 5.2 eV). The OT-RSH calculation for the singly charged
5A anion yields a SOMO–SUMO gap of 3.9 eV. Naturally, in the
solid state, the polarizability of the environment will decrease the
IP and increase the EA and thus reduce the band gap,39−42 which can be empirically estimated: As shown further below, the
measured IP of the 5A HOMO on the MgO(001)/Ag(001) surface is 5.7
eV, thus 0.9 eV lower than that of the gas phase, and, as an increase
similar in magnitude can be expected for the EA (see Supporting Information), a gap reduction of 1.8 eV is estimated.
By taking this into account, the predicted SOMO–SUMO gap is
reduced to 2.1 eV, in closer agreement with the gap measured with
STS (1.7 eV).

Quantification of Charge Transfer
While the STM and
DFT results are qualitatively in agreement, the unambiguous identification
of the states observed in STM/STS may be problematic, owing to a possible
influence of the tip, and the questions regarding the degree of charge
transfer and the energy level alignment remain open. Photoemission
tomography, the analysis of the angular photoemission distribution
within the plane wave final-state approximation, has been demonstrated
to be a quantitative tool to identify photoemission features and orbital
energy ordering,43,44 deduce the molecular orientation,
and even reconstruct real space orbitals of adsorbed molecules.40,45,46

The simulations for the
photoemission distribution from the HOMO and LUMO of two orthogonally
oriented, flat lying 5A molecules are shown in comparison to experimental
momentum maps obtained from a monolayer of 5A on pristine Ag(001)
and on 2 ML MgO(001)Ag(001), respectively, at binding energies where
the emissions of the molecule-induced states appear (Figure 6a). We first note that in both,
the resemblance of simulated and measured HOMO and LUMO intensity
distributions is clear. Thus, the emissions are identified as HOMO
and LUMO states, and, in agreement with STM, the molecules are concluded
to lie flat and parallel to the [110]/[11̅0] azimuths. Furthermore,
detection of the LUMO below EF (EB = 0.3 eV for 5A/Ag(001) and EB = 0.8 eV for 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001)) immediately confirms
that charge transfer into the molecule occurs on both substrates.

results for two isolated 5A molecules with perpendicular orientations

in the momentum maps (depicted as red/blue crosses in panel (a)).
Normal emission (NE) spectra are shown for comparison (black). The
peak areas of the HOMO/LUMO emission features are depicted as red
and blue shadings.

To better quantify the
energies and intensities of the emission
features, angle-resolved spectra were obtained with a goniometer-mounted
electron spectrometer. Spectra at normal emission (kx = ky = 0) and at the emission directions where the HOMO and LUMO
intensities are maximized (red and blue crosses in Figure 6a) are displayed in Figure 6b for 5A/Ag(001)
and 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001), respectively. For 5A on Ag(001), as predicted
by the simulation, no molecular features are observed in normal emission,
and only the Ag(001) Fermi edge is visible. At the geometry of the
HOMO emission maximum, two peaks are visible corresponding to the
HOMO–1 (EB = 2.07 eV) and the HOMO
(EB = 1.14 eV), while for the LUMO geometry,
only an enhancement at the Fermi edge is observed.

For 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001),
again no molecular features are visible
in normal emission, and the intensity at the Fermi edge is diminished
compared to 5A/Ag(001), indicating a well-established MgO interlayer.
At emission directions characteristic for the HOMO and LUMO, the HOMO
is found at EB = 1.94 eV, shifted down
by 0.8 eV relative to 5A on Ag(001), and the LUMO is now a distinct
emission feature well below the Fermi edge at EB = 0.81 eV.

Qualitatively, and somewhat counterintuitively,
the peak area of
the LUMO emission has increased substantially due to the introduction
of the MgO dielectric layer. At the emission geometries of Figure 6b, the plane wave
final-state simulations predict a HOMO/LUMO intensity ratio of 1.26
given the orbitals have the same occupation. With the not unreasonable
assumption that the HOMO occupancy is 2 electrons, the relative experimental
peak areas of the emissions (depicted as shaded blue and red areas
in Figure 6b) can be
used to estimate the LUMO filling. For 5A/Ag(001), a LUMO occupancy
of 0.7 e per molecule is concluded. Fractional charge transfer
is also indicated by the truncated appearance of the LUMO emission
at EF in Figure 6b. This indicates hybridization of the molecular
LUMO with states of the Ag(001) substrate.

Comparing the measured
HOMO/LUMO ratios of several preparations
of 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001) yields a LUMO occupancy of 1.0 ± 0.2 e
per molecule. On increasing the 5A exposure from submonolayer to monolayer
coverage, the HOMO/LUMO intensity ratio remains constant, while the
WF increases essentially linearly with the coverage. As such, there
is no evidence for a relation between the amount of charge transfer
or the fraction of charged molecules with the packing density in the
first layer. This result strongly indicates integer charge transfer
to the LUMO, and hence we conclude the observation of a SOMO for all
adsorbed 5A molecules on 2 ML MgO(001)/Ag(001). A scenario where only
a fraction of the molecules receive integer charge while others remain
uncharged14,47 can be excluded since this would lead to
two distinct HOMO peaks, which is clearly not observed.

Significantly,
the observed LUMO binding energy in photoemission
is in excellent agreement with the filled-state peak position measured
with STS. Thus, the obtained STS energy positions reflect a direct
tunneling process through the molecular states rather than measurement-induced
effects such as charging/discharging, which is often invoked for adsorbates
on insulating layers.27,48 Hence, the two peaks observed
in the STS (Figure 3c) can be confidently attributed to the SOMO (below EF) and SUMO (above EF) of
singly charged 5A on MgO(001)/Ag(001).

Energy Level Alignment
With the entire set of experimental
results, we can now draw a picture of the energy level alignment,
including an attempt to partition the various factors that influence
the alignment and lead to the LUMO being close to EF, which is the necessary condition for the observed charge
transfer (Figure 7).
Naturally, these factors (polarizability, push-back, charge-transfer)
are interconnected, and a partitioning is perhaps strictly not possible.
However, intuitively, one can imagine that during the approach of
the molecule to the surface, the major contributions to getting the
LUMO to a point where charge transfer can occur come from HOMO–LUMO
gap reduction due to the substrate polarizability and downward level-shifts
because of push-back, while the final level alignment is affected
by the charge-transfer dipole. It should be mentioned that as the
molecule gets charged, additional contributions such as dynamic polarizability
effects might influence the level alignment49 and lead to possible asymmetry in the gap reduction. These latter
contributions cannot be estimated from our experimental data and are
thus not taken into account here. However, an analysis of the effect
of substrate polarizability based on DFT and using an approach similar
to that given in ref (50) shows that our experimental estimates of the gap reduction due to
substrate polarizability are reasonable (see Supporting Information).

Figure 7 Partitioning of the energy level alignment for (a) 5A/Ag(001)
and
b) 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001). The orbital energy levels (LUMO, HOMO) of
isolated pentacene (5Agas) are aligned to the vacuum levels
(EV) of Ag(001) and MgO(001)/Ag(001),
and the contributions of polarization (pol.), push-back (p.-b.), charging
(charge), and gap opening (gap, in b only) to the level alignment
are added. The curves on the right side of each figure represent the
measured spectra. Thick lines and bold numbers indicate experimentally
determined energy levels and energy level shifts, whereas broken lines
and normal numbers are derived level energies and shifts.

For 5A/Ag(001) (Figure 7a), we start by aligning the HOMO and LUMO
levels with respect
to the vacuum level (EV) of the system
using the experimentally determined ionization potential (IP = 6.6
eV) and electron affinity (EA = 1.4 eV) of gas-phase 5A. As already
mentioned, at the surface the polarizability of the environment will
decrease the HOMO–LUMO gap. The decrease of the IP can be empirically
estimated by taking the difference of the IPs of the 5A HOMO in the
gas phase (IP5A,gas = 6.6 eV) and on the Ag(001) surface
(IP5A/Ag(001) = Φ5A/Ag(001) + EB,HOMO = 5.0 eV), which is 1.6 eV. Since for
the EA an increase of similar magnitude can be expected, the HOMO–LUMO
gap is significantly reduced, and the LUMO level is pushed down, closer
to EF.41,51 However, without
a reduction of the WF (vacuum level), the EA is nevertheless not large
enough to facilitate charge transfer. From WF measurements we know
that the adsorption of 5A reduces the WF by 0.4 eV, which can be understood
to result from push-back partly compensated by charge transfer. Since
push-back reduces the WF, we estimate its effect to give rise to a
1.2 eV downward shift of all molecular levels, which brings the LUMO
close to EF. As a result, charge transfer
between Ag(001) and 5A is facilitated, and, while the partially occupied
LUMO stays pinned at EF, the interface
dipole created by the charged molecules increases the WF and shifts
the HOMO level up. Note that in our analysis of the energy level alignment
for the 5A/Ag(001) system, the different contributions of push-back
and charge transfer can only indirectly be estimated with the help
of the necessary requirement that the LUMO level has to be close to EF to enable charge transfer. In contrast, a
similar analysis of the energy level alignment for the 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001)
system does not require any assumptions because the effects of push-back
and charge transfer are separated.

For 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001) (Figure 7b), we again start
with the bare Ag(001) surface and
the measured WF, which sets the vacuum level (EV) to 4.3 eV above EF. The formation
of the MgO thin film reduces EV to 2.6
eV – a 1.7 eV reduction due to the push-back. As in the case
of 5A/Ag(001), we align the HOMO and LUMO levels of gas-phase 5A with
respect to the EV of the system and include
the effect of the polarizability (determined in the same way as for
5A/Ag(001), using the WF and the energy of the HOMO level of 5A on
MgO(001)/Ag(001)), which is naturally smaller than for 5A on Ag(001).
This brings the LUMO very close to EF,
enabling charge transfer from the substrate into the molecule. While
the LUMO stays pinned at EF, the interface
dipole created by the charging of the molecule leads to an increase
of the WF by 1.2 eV and a corresponding shift of the HOMO level by
the same magnitude. Because charge transfer through the dielectric
barrier occurs by tunneling, the LUMO is occupied by an integer amount
of charge, and the resulting singly occupied LUMO is split into a
SOMO and a SUMO state separated by a gap of 1.7 eV, as determined
by STS.

It is important to note that our experimental approach
allows us
to estimate separately the major factors that contribute to the energy
level alignment as the molecule interacts with the surface. The consistency
of this approach becomes immediately clear when comparing the experimentally
measured level energies with those obtained by adding the various
contributions of polarizability, push-back, and charge transfer to
the vacuum level-aligned level energies of gas-phase 5A, as done in Figure 7, which are in perfect
agreement with each other.

Conclusion
In
conclusion, our study of the adsorption of pentacene (5A) on
Ag(001) and Ag(001)-supported MgO(001) thin films provides a clear
and comprehensive understanding of charge transfer and energy level
alignment at these model inorganic/organic interfaces at a molecular
level. Using WF measurements, STM and photoemission imaging and spectroscopy,
together with DFT calculations, we show that the molecular LUMO gets
pinned to the Fermi level on both substrates, and we are able to determine
the individual contributions that affect the energy level alignment
and lead to charging of the 5A molecule. In particular, the use of
MgO(001) as thin dielectric layer enables us to demonstrate the transition
from fractional charge transfer at the metal–organic interface
to integer charge occupation of the molecular LUMO on an electronically
decoupling, low-WF substrate. Our study unambiguously identifies the
SOMO and SUMO of the singly charged pentacene anion adsorbed on the
thin dielectric MgO layer and introduces an approach that permits
the quantitative determination of the frontier orbital occupation.

In addition to addressing the problem of energy level alignment
from a very fundamental point of view, our results are significant
for the applied field, such as the organic device community. Dielectric
interlayers are often used to improve charge injection at contacts.12 While they undoubtedly can reduce the electron
injection barrier by WF reduction, if, as is the case here, the reduction
is too great, integer charge transfer occurs and a significant gap
opens, which renders their use counterproductive.

Methods
MgO(100) thin films were grown on clean Ag(001)
surfaces following
a recipe by J. Pal et al.52 The Ag(001) single crystal was cleaned by cycles of Ar+ sputtering (1 kV) and successive annealing (773 K, 2 min). Mg was
deposited in an oxygen background of 1 × 10–6 mbar at a rate of 0.5 ML/min. During deposition, the Ag(001) crystal
was kept at 573 K. The quality of the MgO thin film was checked by
LEED and STM/STS. Pentacene was deposited at a sample temperature
of Tsample = 300 K. The deposition rates
were monitored with a quartz microbalance. STM and STS measurements
were performed at 77 K with a Createc low-temperature
STM attached to a ultrahigh-vacuum preparation chamber (base pressure
2 × 10–10 mbar) using electrochemically etched
tungsten tips. The bias was applied to the sample, and during scanning
on 5A covered surfaces, the tips were never intentionally functionalized.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements were
performed using a goniometer-mounted VG ADES 400 spectrometer equipped
with a helium gas discharge lamp (helium I, hν = 21.2 eV, angle of incidence α = 60°).
Work functions were obtained from the secondary electron cutoff in
normal emission with a sample bias. Photoemission tomography measurements
were performed at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II (U125-2NIM beamline, hν = 21 eV,
α = 40°) with a toroidal analyzer.53 The analyzer collects the full hemicircle of emission in the plane
of incidence, and the momentum maps were obtained by rotating the
crystal azimuth in 1° steps. Photoemission measurements reported
in this work were taken at room temperature or 90 K.

DFT calculations
were performed for the isolated 5A molecule by
utilizing NWChem30 and for the full 5A/MgO(001)/Ag(001)
and 5A/Ag(001) overlayers, for which the VASP code28,29 has been used. The calculations of the isolated molecule were performed
using an OT-RSH functional.36 The simulated
momentum maps of the HOMO and the LUMO of the isolated 5A molecule
are obtained as Fourier transforms of the respective Kohn–Sham
orbital as described in ref (43). The electronic structure calculations for 5A monolayers
adsorbed on Ag(001) and MgO(001)/Ag(001) have been carried out using
a repeated slab approach. The metallic substrate has been modeled
by five metallic layers and the dielectric interface by two layers,
and a vacuum layer of 15 Å has been added between the slabs.
To avoid spurious electrical fields, a dipole layer is inserted in
the vacuum region.54 Exchange–correlation
effects were treated either within the GGA55 or within the HSE hybrid functional35 with k-point meshes of 4 × 8 × 1 and
2 × 4 × 1, respectively. The projector augmented wave (PAW)56 approach was used allowing for a relatively
low kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV, and a first-order Methfessel–Paxton
smearing of 0.1 eV.57 During the geometry
optimization, the atomic positions of the molecular layer, the dielectric
interlayer, and the first two metallic layers were allowed to relax.
In order to account for van der Waals interactions, we employ the
vdW-surf method according to Ruiz et al.58,59 during the geometry optimization.
