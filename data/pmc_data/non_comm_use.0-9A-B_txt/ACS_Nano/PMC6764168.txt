Self-propelled motors have been developed
with promising potential
for medical applications. However, most of them have a size range
at the microscale, which limits their further research for in vivo experiments. Previously, our group developed nanoscaled
motors with a size of around 400 nm with several merits, for example,
delivering both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs/proteins, using
biocompatible fuels while being able to control their motion, and
showing adaptive changes of their speed and navigation to changes
in the environment. It is also well-known that nanoparticles that
are around 20–200 nm in size have advantages in overcoming
cellular barriers and being internalized into cells. Therefore, lowering
the size range of this stomatocyte nanomotor is crucial. However,
the strict control of the size of vesicles in such a low regime as
well as their shape transformation into folded stomatocyte structures
is not trivial. In this study, we fabricated ultrasmall stomatocyte
polymersomes with the size of around 150 nm, which could be a promising
carrier for biomedical purposes. We demonstrated that the addition
of PEG additive allows for both shape transformation of small polymersomes
into stomatocytes and encapsulation of biologics. Biocatalyst catalase
was encapsulated in the inner compartment of the nanomotor, protecting
the enzyme while providing enough thrust to propel the motors. The
ultrasmall stomatocyte motor system allowed propelled motion by converting
H2O2 into O2 in the presence of only
2 mM H2O2, and the velocity of motors correlated
to the O2 production. Compared to small stomatocyte nanomotors,
ultrasmall stomatocyte motors demonstrate enhanced penetration across
the vasculature model and increased uptake by HeLa cells in the presence
of fuel.

==== Body
Inspired
by natural molecular
motors,1−3 scientists have been focusing on developing motors
from the macro- and micro- to the nanometer scale for numerous potential
applications such as nanoscale fabrication, environmental remediation,
and biomedicine.4−10 Recent advances in micro/nanomotor research have made them promising
tools for addressing many biomedical challenges owing to their unique
features, including fast motion, high cargo loading and towing force,
and ease of surface functionalization.11−13 For example, several
motors have already demonstrated great potential for targeted drug
delivery and cargo release efficiency, including self-propelling polymer
multilayer nanorockets and TAT peptide-modified stomatocyte nanomotors.14,15 However, there are still many bottlenecks that need to be addressed,
such as use of metal surfaces that are toxic to humans and the current
size spectra that are not suitable for clinical trials. The size of
nanoparticles is one of the most important factors determining whether
the particles can pass certain biological barriers or not (e.g., blood, extracellular matrix, and cellular barriers).16−19 For instance, particles above the size range of 4–5 nm could
avoid renal and hepatic clearance and have a longer blood circulation
time. Meanwhile, if their sizes are smaller than 200 nm, nanoparticles
are more prone to extravasate from tumor vasculature as vascular abnormalities
in tumor tissues lead to permeability of the vascular system,20,21 allowing tumors to accumulate small particles based on the physiological
principle.22 In this context, researchers
have shown that smaller nanomotors present an advantage in overcoming
cellular barriers and improving cellular uptake.23 For instance, researchers have developed Janus mesoporous
silica nanomotors (MSNs) of less than 100 nm as carriers for drug
delivery with controlled release.24 However,
clearance of these nanomotors by the mononuclear phagocytic system
(MPS) at the blood barrier is possible, due to the lack of biocompatible
elements such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).25 PEGylation onto the surface of nanoparticles prevents interaction
between nanoparticles and with biological fluid components, such as
plasma proteins, leading to reduced MPS clearance and longer circulation
time.16 Hence, developing delivery vehicles
smaller than 200 nm with the capability of longer circulation time
and tumor vasculature penetration is still challenging.

Our
group has previously used a “bottom-up approach”
to fabricate nanomotors by changing the shape of supramolecular assembled
polymersomes into bowl-shaped stomatocytes.26 These stomatocyte nanomotors have been fabricated to have unique
properties such as controlled drug release,27 controlled speed,28 and protein encapsulation.29 Although the size of our stomatocyte motors
is at the nanoscale, they are still larger than 200 nm, which is not
ideal for systemic delivery and biomedical applications. Moreover,
the method we developed for protein encapsulation is laborious, time-consuming,
and not achievable with smaller-sized particles.

In this paper,
we have designed ultrasmall stomatocyte nanomotors
(USSNs) of around 150 nm by using the extrusion method. In our previous
work, several methodologies designed to achieve the structural transformation
of polymersomes into stomatocytes have been developed, such as direct
dialysis,30 reverse dialysis, and organic
solvent addition.26,29 However, none of these methods
were suitable to transform smaller-sized polymersomes into stomatocytes.27,31−35 This may be due to the osmotic pressure created by these methods,
which is not high enough to cause the shape transformation of smaller
polymersomes. Recently, a new methodology for tuning the shape of
polymersomes has been described, which involves adding PEG to the
flexible polymersomes, where PEG is considered to create a higher
osmotic shock for shape transformation.36 Here, PEG solution was added to the extruded solution in the presence
of enzymes (to power motion via chemical gradients)
to form uniform USSNs. By using this method, we can encapsulate proteins
and thus protect them from denaturation. These size-controlled stomatocytes
are also reversible, meaning that they can be converted back to polymersomes
by adding organic solvent (Figure 1). Moreover, the USSN studied in this way was more
efficient at extravasating the tumor vasculature system and accumulating
into tumor cells in comparison to previously reported stomatocyte
nanomotors.

Results
and Discussion
Self-Assembly of Stomatocytes with Controlled
Size
Polymersomes were fabricated by self-assembly of diblock
copolymers
with an average size of 371.1 nm (Figure 2d). The polymersomes thus formed were extruded
with a filter membrane with a pore size of 220 nm to form ultrasmall
polymersomes of around 150.3 nm (Figure 2d). The size and morphology of both polymersomes
were studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and cryo-TEM (Figure 2a,b,d). After uniform ultrasmall polymersomes were
formed, PEG solution was added to provide an instantaneous osmotic
shock for the shape transformation from polymersomes to stomatocytes.36 Compared to our previously synthesized stomatocytes,
more PEG was required for shape transformation of ultrasmall polymersomes
as smaller vesicles with higher curvature stress need more osmotic
pressure for membrane folding.37 The synthesized
ultrasmall stomatocytes were around 153.6 nm and were very uniform
with a small opening as observed by DLS, TEM, and cryo-TEM (Figure 2c,d). As has previously
been shown, osmotic pressure induced by the presence of additives
in the solution causes shape transformation because the inside volume
of polymersomes will decrease according to the different osmotic pressure
created by different amounts of molecules introduced.37−39 In our study, the PEG solution circumvents the limitation in the
osmotic shock of other methods such as dialysis and the addition of
organic solvents and induced the shape changing of small polymersomes,
thus allowing the fabrication of ultrasmall stomatocyte nanomotors.

Effects of Amphiphile Molecular
Weight and Bilayer Thickness
on Stomatocyte Formation
Additive PEG addition methodology
is suitable for fabricating stomatocyte polymersomes even in the ultrasmall
size scale; however, whether this system is robust and can be systematically
used for polymersomes within different parameters is still not clear.
For example, molecular weight is an important factor for forming polymersomes
and might influence the bilayer’s thickness. In order to investigate
this effect and test the suitability of the technique to a wider range
of amphiphiles, we performed the shape transformation using the PEG
addition method on polymersomes assembled from amphiphiles with different
units of PSn. Briefly, PEG44-b-PSn block copolymers
were assembled as described previously into polymersomes, which were
further extruded to produce small polymersomes with different membrane
thicknesses. With the addition of PEG solution, polymersomes reshaped
into stomatocytes. As shown in Figure 3, for polymersomes formed from amphiphiles with 170
units of PS, 5 μL of PEG solution led to a mixture of prolates,
tubes, and stomatocytes with a large opening, whereas with 10 μL
of PEG solution, a small opening of stomatocytes was found, and the
ratio of small opening stomatocytes increases to 100% when 20 μL
of PEG solution was added (Figure 3a–c). For the 200 and 230 units of PS polymersomes,
the shape transformation trends are similar to those of 170 units
of polymersomes, and it is worth noting that the amount of PEG solution
was also increased within the increasing of PS units. Therefore, 30
and 40 μL of PEG solution was required to fabricate pure small
opening stomatocytes instead of 20 μL of PEG solution (Figure 3d–i). Theoretically,
molecular weight of amphiphiles affects the thickness of bilayers
as d ∼ (Mw)0.5 (d is the core thickness), and it is also
supported by cryo-TEM measurements.40 This
has been indeed confirmed by electron microscopy measurements, as
shown in Figure S1; a membrane thickness
of 170, 200, and 230 units of PS stomatocyte polymersomes was measured
and found to be around 15, 17.5, and 20 nm, respectively. The difference
in membrane thickness causes the differences in curvature stress and
the bending energy required for shape transformation.39 The PEG addition method is therefore promising for shape
transformation of different polymers, and the introduced osmotic pressure
is enough for bending the bilayers, even though PS units were increased
to 230, as long as the amount of PEG was also optimized.

Encapsulation of Catalase
Enzyme-powered motors have
been widely studied as promising new generation motors as enzymes
are considered to be versatile and biocompatible alternative catalysts
and also show higher efficiency for propelling motors, which makes
enzyme-powered motors ideal tools for medical research.41,42 Several enzymes have been used as biocatalysts, such as urease,
catalase, glucose oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc.,41,43 which inspired us to fabricate ultrasmall
nanomotors with a biocatalyst system. To fabricate USSN, catalase
was encapsulated in the inner compartments of stomatocytes. This was
carried out by adding catalase to the extruded polymersomes followed
by the PEG addition to the solution. During the shape transformation
of polymersomes, catalase is encapsulated in the stomach of the stomatocytes,
which allows the assembly of the nanomotor propelling the structures
in the presence of H2O2. TEM and cryo-TEM were
used to visualize the morphology of these samples (Figure 4b–b1). More
PEG was required (50 μL) to achieve the shape transformation
of polymersomes in the presence of catalase in comparison to the transformation
without catalase in the reaction mixture. The increase of PEG required
for the shape transformation might be due to the interaction between
enzymes and the membrane of polymersomes; however, no significant
change in the final morphology of stomatocytes was observed.

cryo-TEM images (b1) of size-controlled stomatocytes encapsulated
with enzymes. (c) SDS-PAGE of released enzymes from the stomatocytes
and from a catalase standard curve solution. Scale bar: (b) 500 nm;
(b1) 100 nm.

Releasing of the encapsulated
cargoes from the stomach of stomatocytes
is also important for further studies, which will give us more information
on the encapsulation efficiency of biologics, etc. Whether rigid stomatocytes can turn back to polymersomes or not
therefore becomes pivotal. As shown in Figure S2, when the starting point of the shape transformation changed
to rigid stomatocytes with enzymes encapsulated, the reversibility
of USSN was observed by slowly adding organic solvent. From TEM and
cryo-TEM images, the reverse shape transformation was initiated with
150 μL of organic solvent to stomatocyte solution and is completed
when the organic solvent addition reaches 450 μL, after which
most of the stomatocytes change back to polymersomes. After releasing
catalase from the stomach, the encapsulation efficiency was quantified
by SDS-PAGE. Figure 4c showed the standard curve of catalase, which was used to quantify
the amount of catalase released from stomatocytes. The correlation
curves and the quantified bands are shown in Figure S3. Amplex red assay was employed to study the activity of
the encapsulated catalase, and the calibration curve for enzyme activity
is shown in Figure S3c. Based on these
curves, 16.53 μg of catalase was determined to be encapsulated via SDS-PAGE, which is different from the result from the
activity assay (12.47 μg); the discrepancy is most probably
due to the denaturation of proteins during the loading procedure.
After the encapsulation, enzyme activity decreased by 24.57%. Compared
to previous research with nanoporous silica spheres that retained
62% activity of the encapsulated enzyme,44 this method kept enzymes more active. In our previous described
methods for enzyme encapsulation, enzymes were exposed to plasticizers
for 30 min,29 which might affect even further
their activity. By using this method for encapsulating proteins, they
would just be exposed to organic solvent for several seconds, which
protects the enzyme from denaturation. Moreover, the existence of
PEG solution plays the role of additive in the stabilization of proteins.45,46 Thus, by selecting the appropriate encapsulation method, we were
able to stabilize the enzyme and preserve its activity quite well
for further analysis of movement for biomedical applications. In terms
of protein encapsulation, this method can also be applied systematically.
With the polymeric coatings, proteins can be protected from immunogenicity,
which is promising for protein therapeutics.47,48

Motion Characterization of Ultrasmall Stomatocyte Nanomotors
To study the autonomous movement of enzyme-powered USSNs, nanoparticle
tracking analysis was carried out to record and analyze the real-time
movement of particles.26 USSNs without
fuel (controls) displayed Brownian motion, which was confirmed by
the linear fitting of the MSD curve (⟨r2⟩ = 4Dt).29,49 Adding different concentrations of H2O2 to
the catalase-encapsulated USSN solution resulted in a parabolic fitting
of MSD curves (Figure 5a). The velocity of USSN increased from 13.69 ± 1.11 to 20.52
± 0.35 μm/s with an increase in concentration of H2O2 from 2 to 20 mM. The USSN measured speeds of
117 body lengths/s in the presence of 10 mM H2O2, which is quite fast when compared to other motors of similar size.50 Additionally, these motors have a smaller size
that could explain the higher speeds as less energy is required to
power smaller particles.29 Research from
other groups also tried to lower the concentration of H2O2, for example, 0.5% H2O251 and 1.5 wt %52 were
used for powering motors, which are still higher than 20 mM (0.06%).
The sizes of these motors are still at the microscale, which made
them more difficult to be propelled. However, with similar-sized Janus
particles, speeds lower than those with our stomatocyte nanomotors
were recorded, which could be attributed to the catalyst choice; in
this case, Pt nanoparticles were used for the Janus system which has
catalytic efficiency lower than that of catalase, showcasing the importance
of catalyst choice used to power the motion as well as the shape of
the nanomotors.50,53 Sample trajectories for the movement
of nanomotors at different H2O2 concentration
is shown in Figure 5b. At 0 mM, only Brownian motion was observed with no net displacement
of the particles. However, an increase in net displacement was observed
with an increase in concentration of fuel. The mechanism of motion
for bubble-propelled motors has been extensively studied; basically
the velocity of motors is mainly dependent on the consumption of H2O2 and the O2 production and the formation
of bubbles.54−56 However, most of these studies were based on tubular
motors and also on a microscale, which may not provide direct evidence
for further understanding of nanoscale bubble-propelled motors. On
the other hand, tracking nanoscale motors is still a challenge as
they are too small to be observed using optical microscopy techniques,
let alone see the bubble production. By using an oxygraph system,
the oxygen produced by decomposing H2O2 can
be detected, which may give us some information on the relationship
between bubble production and the movement of nanomotors. Here, to
demonstrate that the movement of USSNs is related to the decomposition
of H2O2, the O2 evolution rate was
studied for different H2O2 concentrations (Figure 5c). As expected,
increased oxygen evolution was observed with an increase in H2O2 concentration, and this directly correlated
with the increase in the speed of the nanomotors (Figure 5d), which suggested that bubble
production might be the essential factor in powering motors.

Enhanced Penetration Across Vasculature Models
and Internalization
of Nanomotors with Controlled Size
To accumulate nanoparticles
into tumor tissues, a passive delivery pathway based on the enhanced
permeation and retention (EPR) effect has been actively used, due
to the presence of immature and permeable tumor vasculature.57−59 However, this passive method can also be limited by the pore size
of these leaky vessels. Furthermore, most of the tumors have a vascular
pore size ranging from 100 to 800 nm,21,60,61 and nanoparticles with a size of around 130 nm produced
promising results from the perspective of the EPR effect.62 In this study, the penetration of nanomotors
through a confluent monolayer of pulmonary artery endothelial cells
was studied to investigate the size influence of nanomotors when passing
through the vasculature model. Corning transwell inserts with porous
membranes (pore size 3 μm) were used to seed cells, and small
stomatocyte nanomotors (SSNs) and USSNs made by a PEG addition method
(Figure S4) were added on the top compartments
of the insets, as shown in Figure S5a.
Nanomotors in the top and bottom compartments were collected and washed
by centrifugation after 2 h incubation. Fluorescence intensity was
studied using a plate reader. As shown in Figure S5b, in comparison with SSN particles, USSN particles’
translocation increased by 13.64%, from 38.59 to 52.23% in the absence
of H2O2. When 2 mM H2O2 was added as a fuel for the motion of nanomotors, 65.93% of USSN
particles were present in the bottom chamber, compared to SSN particles
(48.91%). A 17% increase was observed, showing that USSN is much better
for undergoing tumor vasculature both with and without fuel. To demonstrate
the formation of EPR model, transepithelial/transendothelial electrical
resistance (TEER) was measured via a chopstick electrode
EVOM2 (World Precision Instruments). The TEER was also measured after
conducting the experiment, to study whether the cell monolayer permeability
was changed by the motors and the addition of H2O2. The morphology of the monolayer endothelial cells was also studied
by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) before and after the
experiment. As shown in Figure S6, the
cell monolayer was formed, and no difference was found from the TEER
and cell morphology studies before and after the experiment was conducted,
as incubation time is limited.

It is also well-known that cellular
uptake of nanoparticles (for example, liposomes,63 gold particles,64 and silica
particles65) is size-dependent and plays
a major role in the uptake efficiency and endocytic pathway, although
physicochemical properties such as surface charge and surface functionality
could also affect the internalization of NPs.17 When it comes to motors, similar rules are expected to apply, although
the scenario is more complex because factors like interactions between
active motors and dynamic surfaces (such as cell membranes), fuels
that are used to power the motors and mechanism of motion, can affect
particle uptake. In this experiment, we compared two nanomotors with
different size distributions fabricated by the same polymer to investigate
the influence of size on cellular uptake using human cervical cancer
cells (HeLa cells) as a model cell. The material toxicity was studied
by detecting the cell viability after the nanomotors were incubated
with HeLa cells for 24 h. As shown in Figure S8, no significant cytotoxicity was observed after the cells were incubated
with ultrasmall stomatocyte polymersomes and ultrasmall stomatocyte
nanomotors. Similar results were also observed when cells were incubated
for a short time scale (3.5 h) and studied by CLSM, as shown in Figure S9, in which the cell viability was detected
by propidium iodide. A Leica Microsystems TSC SP8 HyVolution confocal
microscope was used to visualize the cellular uptake after HeLa cells
were incubated with SSN and USSN for 3.5 h,66 and the fluorescence area from Nile Red was quantified with Fiji.
As shown in Figure 6, the USSN showed a cellular uptake efficiency higher than that of
the SSN, with 3.7 times higher fluorescence area observed. Although
in the presence of 2 mM H2O2, USSN showed higher
uptake efficiency and the fluorescence area from Nile Red was 2.2
times more than that of the SSN. Compared to the samples without H2O2, there was increased internalization with both
nanomotors, which is mostly due to the active movement of motors as
no cell death was observed during the experiment. 3D videos of these
cells were made to prove that nanomotors were actually embedded inside
the cells instead of attaching to the membrane (Video S1 and Video S2). Moreover,
flow cytometry was also recruited for further uptake quantification.
As shown in Figure S11, USSNs showed the
highest uptake efficiency with the presence of fuel, following the
trend observed by CLSM. To study whether H2O2 damaged the cell membrane during the experiment, which might lead
to a higher uptake but not the motion of nanomotors, a cell membrane
permeability assay was conducted using propidium iodide because it
is not membrane-permeable. As shown in Figure S10, H2O2 had almost no influence on
the cells when nanomotors were added to incubate with the cells. In
contrast, when polymersomes were added together with H2O2, the cell membrane was more permeable. The difference
between samples was the presence of catalase that decomposes H2O2 to O2, which decreases the H2O2-related damage. As the H2O2 concentration decreases, moreover, catalase has also been used as
an antioxidant enzyme to detoxify H2O2,67 which protects cells from being damaged. The
above results suggest that smaller-sized nanomotors are more promising
for biomedical applications, as they exhibit positive results in passing
through the leaking vessels and cell membranes.

peroxide for 3.5 h. Cell nuclei were dyed with DAPI after cells were

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully fabricated ultrasmall stomatocyte
polymersomes with uniform size (150 nm) by applying the PEG addition
method, and we have demonstrated that this method can be systematically
used for the shape transformation of polymersomes under different
conditions. Biocompatible catalyst catalase was encapsulated inside
these ultrasmall stomatocyte nanomotors in several seconds. By decomposing
H2O2, O2 was produced to power the
motion of USSNs even with a very low concentration of fuel. Furthermore,
the moving velocity of USSNs was found to have a positive correlation
with O2 production, which is also concentration-dependent
at the same time. The capability of encapsulating enzymes in the inner
compartment makes the USSN a promising nanovesicle for biomedical
applications, such as protein delivery and imaging. Compared to small
stomatocyte nanomotors, USSNs were more efficient in penetrating a
confluent monolayer of pulmonary artery endothelial cells, which suggests
that more cargoes can be delivered by USSNs than SSNs through the
EPR effect. Moreover, USSNs were much more capable of internalizing
into the HeLa cells with or without the presence of H2O2 due to the smaller size range and faster motion.

Materials and Methods
All reagents and chemicals were
purchased from commercial sources
and used as received. Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ) was used in all
of the experiments. Catalase (E3289) from bovine liver, ≥20000
units/mg protein, lyophilized powder, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Dynamic light scattering experiments were studied on a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano S equipped with a He–Ne (633 nm, 4 mW) laser
and an Avalanche photodiode detector at an angle of 173°. Transmission
electron microscopy samples were prepared in the following way: a
solution of sample (5 μL) was air-dried on a carbon-coated Cu
TEM grid (200 mesh). A JEOL TEM 1400 microscope at an acceleration
voltage of 120 kV and a JEOL TEM 2100 at an acceleration voltage of
200 kV were used for the characterization of shape transformation.

Synthesis
of Poly(ethylene glycol)44-b-Poly(styrene)n
Polymerization
of PEG-b-PS was reported in previous research.30 Molecular weights of the block copolymers were
measured on a Shimadzu Prominence GPC system equipped with a PL gel
5 μm mixed D column (Polymer Laboratories) and differential
refractive index and UV (254 nm) detectors. NMR spectra were obtained
on a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer in CDCl3.

Preparation
of Polymersomes
Modified from our previous
research,36 PEG44-b-PSn (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of
an organic solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1,4-dioxane
in a 4:1 ratio by volume with a magnetic stirring bar. After the solution
was dissolved for 30 min, 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water was added to the
solution at a rate of 1 mL h–1 at room temperature
with vigorous stirring (900 rpm) to make polymersomes. Ultrasmall
polymersomes were fabricated by passing 700 μL of polymersome
solution through a 220 nm syringe filter (screening devices) in a
mixture solvent of THF/dioxane/water = 8/2/5 by volume.

Preparation
of Ultrasmall Stomatocytes and Encapsulation of
Enzymes Inside the Stomatocyte Cavity via the PEG
Addition Method
The procedures for preparation of polymersomes
were the same as those described above. After polymersomes were made,
30 μL of PEG2000 aqueous solution (100 mg/mL) was added into
the ultrasmall polymersome suspension (550 μL) under a stirring
speed of 900 rpm for 1 min. Ten milliliters of Milli-Q water was poured
into the solution to quench the structure. For encapsulating enzymes
inside stomatocytes, 1 mg of catalase was dissolved in 50 μL
of water and was added into the polymersome solution or ultrasmall
polymersome solution. After being mixed for 2 min with a stirring
plate, an appropriate amount of PEG2000 solution (100 mg/mL) was added
and the solutions were quenched as described. The organic solvent
and non-encapsulated enzymes in the system were removed by centrifugation.

Solvent Addition Method for Reshaping Stomatocytes
First,
500 μL of a rigid USSN solution was transferred into
a 5 mL vial. A THF/dioxane (4:1 v/v) mixture was added via a syringe pump with the rate of 300 μL h–1 under a stirring speed of 900 rpm by using a stirring plate. Samples
were withdrawn and quenched at different time points (30, 60, 90,
and 180 min). TEM and cryo-TEM sample were made to follow the shape
transformation.

Release of Enzymes from the Stomatocyte Cavity
Encapsulated
catalase was released from the stomatocyte by the solvent addition
method: 450 μL of THF/dioxane (4:1 v/v) was added to 500 μL
of rigid USSN solution as described above to reshape the stomatocytes.
Five milliliters of Milli-Q water was added to quench the structure
and dilute the organic solvent. Spin filters with a 10 kDa membrane
was used to remove the organic solvent and collect the released enzymes.
The presence of free enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE.

SDS-PAGE Analysis
SDS-PAGE was performed on a mini-vertical
electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 2 Cell, Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Dilutions of catalase ranging from 5 μg to 125 ng were run on
10% Tris-glycine precast gels at 120 V for 60 min. An electrode buffer
(0.1% SDS, 0.25 M glycine, 0.025 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) was used as described
in the manufacturer’s instructions. The gels were stained by
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining solution and washed by destaining
solution for several times.

Autonomous Movement of the Stomatocyte Nanomotors
The
movement of nanomotors was evaluated at five different H2O2 concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mM). Nanomotors
(final concentration around 3 × 108 particles mL–1) were quickly injected into the NanoSight LM10 sample
chamber after being mixed with H2O2 solution.
Videos (each video duration time 30 s, rate 30 frames s–1) were recorded, and the particle movement was analyzed with nanoparticle
tracking software (NTA 2.2).

Cell Uptake of Stomatocyte Nanomotors
Two hundred microliters
of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) buffer
with 1 × 105 cells was added to an 8-well plate (ibidi
GmbH) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The incubation buffer
was then replaced by 200 μL of DMEM buffer with stomatocyte
nanomotors (particle concentration = 2 × 1010 particles/mL).
After 3.5 h incubation with or without 2 mmol H2O2, the cell culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with
PBS three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min
at room temperature. For nuclear staining, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (Millipore) was added and incubated for 1 h. After the staining
solution was removed, cells were washed with PBS buffer three times.
The stained cells were imaged by SP8× confocal microscope, and
the presence of fluorescence was measured by Fiji.
