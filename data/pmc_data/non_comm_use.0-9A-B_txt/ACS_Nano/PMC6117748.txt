The
enzyme sphingomyelinase (SMase) is an important biomarker for
several diseases such as Niemann Pick’s, atherosclerosis, multiple
sclerosis, and HIV. We present a two-component colorimetric SMase
activity assay that is more sensitive and much faster than currently
available commercial assays. Herein, SMase-triggered release of cysteine
from a sphingomyelin (SM)-based liposome formulation with 60 mol %
cholesterol causes gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aggregation, enabling
colorimetric detection of SMase activities as low as 0.02 mU/mL, corresponding
to 1.4 pM concentration. While the lipid composition offers a stable,
nonleaky liposome platform with minimal background signal, high specificity
toward SMase avoids cross-reactivity of other similar phospholipases.
Notably, use of an SM-based liposome formulation accurately mimics
the natural in vivo substrate: the cell membrane.
We studied the physical rearrangement process of the lipid membrane
during SMase-mediated hydrolysis of SM to ceramide using small- and
wide-angle X-ray scattering. A change in lipid phase from a liquid
to gel state bilayer with increasing concentration of ceramide accounts
for the observed increase in membrane permeability and consequent
release of encapsulated cysteine. We further demonstrated the effectiveness
of the sensor in colorimetric screening of small-molecule drug candidates,
paving the way for the identification of novel SMase inhibitors in
minutes. Taken together, the simplicity, speed, sensitivity, and naked-eye
readout of this assay offer huge potential in point-of-care diagnostics
and high-throughput drug screening.

==== Body
Sphingomyelins
(SMs) are an
important class of phospholipids, constituting 2–15% of the
total phospholipid content of mammalian tissues.1 SMs and other sphingolipids are widely reported to induce
structural rigidity in cell membranes and are key features of lipid
rafts. Recently, it has become evident that their role is much more
than a structural one.2 Specifically, the
hydrolysis of SM by the enzyme SMase leads to the production of ceramide,
which is a downstream cell-signaling molecule responsible for a host
of pathologies.3−5 Therefore, changes in SMase activity are associated
with several diseases such as Niemann Pick’s,6,7 atherosclerosis,8 depression,9,10 multiple sclerosis, and HIV.10,11

Upregulated SMase
activity provides a reliable biomarker target
for improved diagnostic and prognostic tools, which could significantly
improve patient outcome. Likewise, in the pharmaceutical industry,
high-throughput assays to identify novel SMase inhibitors are crucial
for developing effective treatments. A quick and convenient method
to determine SMase activity and inhibition is highly desirable in
the development of point-of-care sensors for disease detection and
treatment. However, current SMase activity and inhibition assays rely
on complicated multistep enzymatic reactions and expensive equipment
to perform read-outs11−13 and the
use of radioactive markers14 or non-natural
substrates,15 and often measure SMase concentration
rather than activity.16 Similarly, a simple
assay to screen for SMase inhibitors rapidly would allow the as-yet
untapped potential for SMase inhibitors as therapeutics to be realized.

Liposome aggregation and phosphate quantification-based assays
to study the relative activity of SMase on membrane bilayers of different
compositions are well known.17,18 These methods are often
used to study the relative activity of SMase to, for example, different
lipid compositions. However, these assays typically use enzyme activities
of >1 U/mL and are orders of magnitude less sensitive than required for
applications in quantifying biologically relevant SMase activities.
Liposomes formulated from both natural19−21 and synthetic lipids22 have been shown to release their cargo in the
presence of a target protein, causing a colorimetric response. Release
of encapsulated contents from liposomes can also be triggered by osmotic
shock, as used in detecting pathogens with attomolar sensitivity.23 The activity of SMase on membrane bilayers is
largely influenced by their lipid composition. Mixtures of SM with
cholesterol (Chol)18 and/or phospholipids
such as phosphatidylcholines (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE)
have been shown to be substantially more active toward SMase than
bilayers comprising pure SM.17 The origin
of this increase in activity is a change in physical state from a
gel (pure SM) to a fluid membrane bilayer.24 Ternary mixtures with coexisting liquid and gel phases have been
shown to further increase membrane bilayer activity. The gel phase
sequesters the ceramide product, depleting its concentration in the
liquid-ordered phase and reducing the inhibitory effect it has on
SMase,25 whereas the presence of cholesterol
“dissolves” SM into an enzyme-accessible liquid ordered
phase. However, PC- and PE-containing mixtures are not ideal for SMase-selective
assays since such phospholipids are also active toward other phospholipases.
Additionally, the reaction product of SM hydrolysis, ceramide, has
a large influence on SMase activity due to its impact on lipid phase
behavior. A review article by Goñi etal. provides a nice discussion on the subject.26

Aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
and the resulting color
changes provide a useful transduction mechanism for biodetection,
and numerous optical sensing platforms have been developed based on
the aggregation principle.27−29 The color changes induced by
aggregation of plasmonic NPs originate from the coupling between the
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the NPs, resulting in
lower energy excitation levels and red-shifted absorbance bands.30,31 Different types of aggregation mechanisms have been reported32 including the bridging of NPs by complementary
recognition complexes, hydrogen bonds, donor–acceptor interactions,33,34 and host–guest interactions.35,36 The combination
of NP-based aggregation assays with liposomal platforms offers a useful
system for the sensitive detection of proteins. We hypothesized that
combining liposomes and AuNP aggregation would allow detection of
very low SMase activity by the naked eye.

Herein, we present
an efficient colorimetric assay that measures
activity of SMase on liposome membrane bilayers. Using lipids formulated
into liposomes instead of suspensions of free lipids used in currently
available assays37 helps mimic the natural
environment for SMase reactivity, i.e., the cell membrane. We prepared robust liposomes containing cysteine,
which is released in the presence of active SMase. The released cysteine
causes rapid aggregation of gold nanoparticles, leading to a colorimetric
read-out visible by the naked eye. To gain insight into the origins
of membrane reorganization leading to cysteine release, we carried
out small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS, respectively)
measurements of bulk lipid mixtures. These measurements showed a phase
transition between 0 and 50% conversion of SM to ceramide from a fluid
to gel phase, suggesting changes in permeability across the bilayer
during this lipid rearrangement process. This straightforward assay
allows us to achieve naked eye sensitivity down to 0.08 mU/mL SMase,
corresponding to a concentration of 5.5 pM, which is as sensitive
as the current commercially available absorbance-based assays. Quantification
based on AuNP absorbance spectra achieves a sensitivity of 0.02 mU/mL
SMase. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the platform to rapidly
detect SMase inhibitors at physiologically relevant concentrations.

Results
and Discussion
A schematic of the assay design is shown in Figure 1. In the presence
of active SMase, the SM
component of SM:Chol liposomes is enzymatically hydrolyzed into ceramide
and phosphocholine. This process causes the release of cysteine from
these liposomes as their membranes undergo a fluid to gel phase transition.
The released cysteine causes aggregation of AuNPs, leading to a colorimetric
change due to the LSPR effect of the AuNPs. In the absence of enzyme
activity the AuNP dispersion appears red, whereas in the presence
of SMase activity a blue color is observed with an enzyme concentration-dependent
tonality variation, visible by the naked eye. This assay strategy
combining the amplification from the liposomes and sensitive color
change from AuNP LSPR shifts provides a robust and sensitive platform
for SMase detection.

(Bottom) Action of SMase on BSM:Chol liposomes encapsulating cysteine
leads to a composition-driven membrane phase change with the formation
of ceramide-rich gel domains and partitioning of cholesterol into
remaining SM domains. This causes cysteine leakage and aggregation
of subsequently added gold nanoparticles by formation of hydrogen
bonds between cysteine molecules on adjacent nanoparticles. Graphic

Cysteine-Mediated AuNP Aggregation
Cysteine initiates
the aggregation of AuNPs through interparticle zwitterionic electrostatic
interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds.39,40 We used citrate-stabilized AuNPs to perform the cysteine-mediated
particle aggregation, studied through transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and ultraviolet/visible spectrometry (UV/vis). As shown in Figure 2a, ∼13 nm
diameter AuNPs are well dispersed in solution, but form large aggregates
(Figure 2b) upon addition
of cysteine. Accordingly, a color tonality change from the red (dispersed
AuNPs) to a blue color (aggregated AuNPs) is observed (Figure 2c). Particle aggregation was
also evident in the UV/vis spectra. Multiple modes of coupling are
expected due to the complexity of the aggregates formed, with the
absorbance and intensity of the aggregated system dependent on the
degree of aggregation and orientation of the individual particles
within the aggregate. Upon increasing cysteine concentration and particle
aggregation, the 525 nm peak (dispersed AuNPs) broadens to form a
shoulder at 640 nm, followed by generation of a new absorption peak
at around 660 nm (Figure 2d). In these aggregated systems, the first peak near 525 nm
can be attributed to the quadrupole plasmon excitation in coupled
spheres, while the broader peak with longer wavelength is due to the
dipole plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticles.41,42 Determining the ratios between the areas under the curve of UV/vis
spectral regions corresponding to dispersed and aggregated AuNPs provides
a reliable calibration of analyte concentrations43,44 (see the Supporting Information for discussion,
Figures S1 and S2). For simplicity, we used changes in the ratio between
absorbance at 640 and 525 nm to accurately capture changes in absorbance
even at lower cysteine concentrations (SI, Figure S3). Notably, the aggregation of the AuNPs begins at 0.4
μM cysteine concentration and reaches a saturation value at
2 μM cysteine for a fixed 15 min time interval (SI, Figure S3). Therefore, we recorded all subsequent
experiments at this time point. The dynamic range of colorimetric
detection of cysteine concentration is dependent on several parameters
including particle concentration and buffer conditions.

SMase-Sensitive Liposome Formulations
One of the most
important requirements for small molecule (such as cysteine) containing
liposome-based assays is liposomal formulations that are intrinsically
nonpermeable and stable over a period of time. Initially, we focused
on producing nonleaky membrane compositions, varying the mol percentages
of SM extracted from bovine brain SM (BSM) and Chol within the liquid
ordered state. We prepared cysteine-containing liposomes using conventional
lipid film hydration and extrusion through polycarbonate membranes
of varying pore sizes. We then removed free cysteine molecules from
the liposome suspension by filtration through a Sephadex G-100 column.
AuNP aggregation induced by cysteine released from the liposomes provided
a straightforward assay for optimizing liposome formulations.

Initial screening of different BSM:Chol ratios showed that liposomes
formulated from lipid films with a BSM:Chol molar ratio of 30:70 and
60:40 were intrinsically leaky. On mixing these liposomes with AuNPs,
we observed an immediate color change of the solution from red to
blue. On the other hand, lipid films with BSM:Chol molar ratios of
40:60 and 50:50 both formed stable liposomes that retained their encapsulated
cysteine over a number of days. However, the 50:50 mol % mixtures
had a slightly higher background leakage, resulting in an absorbance
ratio of 640 nm/525 nm greater than 0.4 upon mixing liposomes with
AuNPs without SMase (Figure 3a). The higher background gave rise to a slightly purple tonality
and made naked eye detection more difficult than in the case of liposomes
formulated from BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % lipid films, which under the
same conditions showed absorbance ratios below 0.4 and appeared red
in color. Additionally, the dynamic range for 40:60 mol % liposomes
was slightly higher than that of 50:50 mol %. Therefore, BSM:Chol
40:60 mol % appeared to be the optimal lipid composition.

for each spectrum. (c) Effect of concentration of encapsulated cysteine:

BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % and 100 mM encapsulated cysteine. Liposome concentration
is normalized to total volume of encapsulated cysteine based on NTA
size measurements. In all cases, liposomes were incubated for 1 h
with SMase in the reaction buffer, followed by addition of AuNPs.
Absorbance spectra were recorded at 15 min after AuNP addition. The
responses in (a), (c), and (d) are the average of three independent
measurements, and the error bars represent the standard deviation.

While previous studies have reported
the membrane phase behavior
of EggSM:Chol lipid mixtures up to 50 mol % Chol, to our knowledge
there are no previous reports of BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % vesicles. In
order to confirm that liposomes with such a lipid composition can
indeed be formed from BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % films, we characterized
the liposomes formulated from BSM:Chol 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, and 30:70
mol % films using 1H NMR. We prepared liposomes by hydrating
lipid films with water, vortexing, and extruding, as described earlier.
The liposome samples were lyophilized and redissolved in CDCl3 before measuring their 1H NMR spectra. We then
calculated two ratios for each spectrum by comparing areas under peaks
for Chol at 0.68 (3H)45 and 1.84 ppm (3H)46 and BSM at 5.70 ppm (1H).47 For full NMR spectra and integrals, see Figures S7–S13. It can be observed that the calculated
Chol mol % in the liposome samples agreed quite well with that of
the lipid films containing 40, 50, and 60 mol % Chol (Figure 3b). Specifically, we observed
Chol content increasing steadily at respectively 43.3 ± 3.5,
55.8 ± 0.1, and 64.7 ± 1.1 mol %. The slight discrepancy
between calculated and measured Chol content is not surprising given
the pretreatment of the sample and known measurement uncertainty of
quantitative NMR, even under extensively optimized conditions.48 Notably, liposomes formulated from 70 mol %
Chol lipid films had significantly less Chol than predicted at only
61.7 ± 0.5 mol % Chol. Therefore, the saturation limit of Chol
in the BSM membrane bilayer appears to be between 60 and 70 mol %.
Above the membrane saturation limit, crystals of excess Chol are removed
during the extrusion process. This observation is supported by SAXS/WAXS
studies (Figures 7 and S6), which show a single liquid ordered (Lo) phase for BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % lipid films, with no observed
formation of Chol crystals, which would be expected above the saturation
limit of Chol in BSM.

To achieve high sensitivity, the
optimal liposome formulation is
expected to depend on the concentration of encapsulated cysteine.
We prepared 100 nm liposomes formulated from BSM:Chol 40:60 mol %
lipid films with 50, 100, or 200 mM encapsulated cysteine. While no
difference was observed between the 50 and 100 mM cysteine liposomes,
the 200 mM cysteine liposomes were sensitive down to lower SMase activities
(Figure 3c). The background
640/525 nm ratio of >0.4 gave rise to a purple-colored solution,
making
the distinction between background and low SMase activities difficult
by eye. Therefore, we considered cysteine concentrations of 100 mM
to be most suitable for this colorimetric sensor.

We also tested
the effect of liposome size on the SMase assay sensitivity.
We formulated liposomes by hydrating BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % lipid films
with 100 mM buffered cysteine solution, followed
by vortexing and then extrusion through polycarbonate membranes with
100 or 200 nm pore sizes. We normalized liposome concentrations measured
by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to contain the same total
volume of encapsulated cysteine. Liposome hydrodynamic radii, determined
using dynamic light scattering (DLS), gave intensity-based measurements
reporting average diameters of 122.0 nm (PDI 0.10) and 192.8 nm (PDI
0.15) for liposomes extruded through 100 and 200 nm pore sizes, respectively.
Therefore, the final concentration of 100 nm liposomes was 8.5 ×
1010 particles/mL (140 pM), and that of 200 nm
liposomes was 1.8 × 1010 particles/mL (30 pM).
We observed that the 100 nm liposomes have a limit of detection (at
three times higher than the standard deviation of the control) of
0.02 mU/mL compared with 0.5 mU/mL in the case of 200 nm liposomes
(Figure 3d). The 200
nm liposomes contain 4 times as many lipids per liposome compared
to the 100 nm ones. Therefore, to achieve the same change in the overall
membrane composition, 4 times as many SM molecules must be hydrolyzed.
In these assay conditions the SMase and liposome concentrations are
within the same order of magnitude as each other. Hence, over the
same incubation time, fewer 200 nm liposomes reach the required conversion
of SM to ceramide to induce a phase change with consequent cysteine
release.

Following the above optimizations, we concluded that
the BSM:Chol
40:60 mol % liposomes with 100 nm diameter and containing 100 mM encapsulated
cysteine (hereafter, referred to as BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes) were
the most suitable liposomes for the final SMase assays. Further characterizations
of the BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes showed predominantly unilamellar spherical
vesicles as observed in CryoTEM (Figure 4a) and a monodisperse population with mean
hydrodynamic diameter of 120.1 ± 2.4 nm (Figure 4b, blue trace), measured by NTA. Liposome
size and concentration were stable over 1 h in the reaction buffer
comprising Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), 1 mM
MgSO4, and 1 mM CaCl2 (Figure 4b, black trace). We found these concentrations
of MgSO4 and CaCl2 to be optimal for naked-eye
detection of SMase using the liposome–AuNP hybrid platform
(SI, Figure S4). At liposome concentrations
up to around 8.5 × 1010 particles/mL, there was no
observable cysteine leakage upon 1 h incubation with DPBS including
1 mM MgSO4 and 1 mM CaCl2. However, above this
threshold, evolution of a purple color was observed (Figure S5). Notably, the liposomes were stable in DPBS at
4 °C for at least one month (Figure 4c) with no observed cysteine leakage, indicating
the possibility of long-term storage for commercial applications.

We studied enzymatic hydrolysis-induced changes to size and morphology
of the BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes in the reaction buffer containing
1 mU/mL SMase, with a final liposome concentration of 8.5 × 1010 particles/mL. As shown in Figure 3b (red trace), we observed a distinct drop
in the liposome concentration measured by NTA after 1 h of incubation
with SMase. CryoTEM of this sample confirmed a huge variation in liposome
size and morphology, with liposomes from 20 to 200 nm diameter observed
and the evolution of elongated rod-like structures (Figure 4a). The TEM grid was also significantly
less populated with liposomes than the sample without SMase, despite
both samples having the same initial liposome concentration. These
observations confirm the disruption of liposomes upon addition of
SMase on this BSM:Chol 40:60 liposome formulation.

Specificity
and Selectivity of the Liposome-Based Assay
We observed cysteine
release as a function of SMase activity via changes
in the AuNP LSPR, with an increase in the 640
nm peak intensity and a decrease at 525 nm. To confirm that the cysteine
release from the BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes is specific to SMase-mediated
cleavage of SM, we performed control experiments with denatured SMase.
Liposomes that had been incubated with either active SMase or the
surfactant Triton X100 (positive control) led to a blue color, with
a 640/525 nm absorbance ratio greater than 1 (Figure 5a). However, incubation of the liposomes
with SMase that had been denatured by heating to 85 °C for 30
min (dSMase) led to an absorbance ratio only slightly above the baseline
of the intrinsic AuNP absorption ratio. While the slight increase
in absorbance ratio compared to the baseline was possibly due to a
combination of incomplete enzyme denaturation and increased scattering
from the dSMase/AuNP/liposome agglomerates, it is much less than the
increase observed with the same concentration of active SMase. In
control experiments, AuNPs incubated with SMase or dSMase in the absence
of liposomes showed absorbance ratios of <0.4 and appeared red
(Figure 5a). Likewise,
AuNPs and liposomes co-incubated without SMase appeared red. Therefore,
it can be inferred that the release of cysteine is driven by the hydrolysis
of BSM within the liposome membranes by active SMase.

We assessed
selectivity of the liposome formulation toward SMase by screening
activity toward a range of other commonly occurring phospholipases.
As shown in Figure 5b, we observed no activity even at up to 10 mU/mL enzyme activities
of snake and bee phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and
phospholipase D (PLD). While phospholipase C (PLC) showed almost no
activity at 1 mU/mL, activity at 10 mU/mL was similar to that of SMase.
Specific phospholipase C inhibitors such as 1,10-phenanthroline could
overcome any eventual interference of phospholipase C activity in
human patient samples. As expected, there was no change in absorption
of the control (no protein) baseline on incubation of liposomes with
lysozyme (Lys) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), confirming that cysteine
release is not induced by protein adsorption onto the liposome surface,
but rather by the SMase-induced hydrolysis of SM.

Colorimetric
Detection of SMase
Following the characterization
of the liposomal system, we tested the sensitivity of the plasmonic
assay toward SMase using the optimum BSM:Chol 40:60 liposome formulation.
For these liposomes, total release of encapsulated contents leads
to a final cysteine concentration of 10 μM in the reaction buffer.
This concentration ensures that even a small percentage of released
cysteine results in complete aggregation of AuNPs (cf. Figure S3). We incubated BSM:Chol liposomes
in the reaction buffer containing 0.005 to 20 mU/mL SMase for 1 h
at room temperature followed by the addition of AuNPs. After 15 min
of AuNP incubation, we determined the limit of detection to be 0.02
mU/mL (1.4 pM enzyme concentration) using the ratio between absorption
at 640 and 525 nm on a plate reader (Figure 6a). Here, the limit of detection is the lowest
concentration of SMase that yields a signal 3 times higher than the
standard deviation of the control. It should be noted that the SMase
activity/concentration we report is based on the stock concentration
provided by the commercial supplier. Our assay achieves better sensitivity
than the commercially available assay kits, in a shorter time frame,
at room temperature, and without multiple enzymatic amplification
steps. In addition to sensitive absorbance-based measurements, we
were able to distinguish clinically relevant SMase activities as low
as 0.08 mU/mL by the naked eye. The high sensitivity of this assay
is attributed to the specificity of SMase toward the liposomes, signal
amplification from the release on the order of 106 cysteine
molecules per liposome, efficient aggregation of AuNPs by the released
cysteine, and the favorable plasmonic properties of AuNPs.

Our
group and others have previously shown a lag-burst effect on interaction
of phospholipase A2 with liposomes.19,49 Such lag phases have been reported previously for SM-containing
liposomes in the presence of SMase, where the length of the lag phase
is inversely proportional to the final enzyme activity50,51 and a marked decrease in lag time is observed from the gel to fluid
state.17 Here, we also observe this phenomenon
on incubating SMase at 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mU/mL activities with BSM:Chol
40:60 liposomes, whereby we added AuNPs at varying time points between
0 and 1 h. The time dependence of the extent of aggregation was inversely
related to the SMase activity (Figure 6b). Specifically, we observed a lag time of 45 min
in the 0.1 mU/mL sample before aggregation. We did not observe any
time lag on direct addition of even very low concentrations of cysteine
to AuNPs (Figure S3), where any aggregation
is immediate.

Characterization of BSM:Chol 40:60 Membrane
Phase Behavior
Changes in lipid membrane stability and permeability
have been
attributed to changes in the lipid ordering. In particular, membranes
are known to become significantly more permeable during fluid–gel
structural transitions. Therefore, to characterize the mechanistic
origins of the observed liposome destabilization and cysteine leakage,
we used SAXS and WAXS to study the phase behavior of bulk lipid mixtures
containing 60 mol % cholesterol and varying molar ratios of BSM:BC
from BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % to BSM:BC:Chol 20:20:60 mol % at 25 °C,
where BC is bovine ceramide. Start and end points are shown in Figure 7a and b with sequential
data available in Figure S6. The start
and end point lipid mixtures represent the initial liposome lipid
membrane composition and lipid membrane composition after 50% conversion
of BSM to ceramide, respectively.

The BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % mixture
(Figure 7a) shows predominantly
a single lamellar phase with a lattice parameter of 66.7 ± 0.1
Å. The splitting of the second-order peak shows evidence of a
minor coexisting structure, which we attribute to the fact that BSM
is a natural mixture of lipids predominantly (>50%) composed of
18:0
SM, with the next largest component (>21%) being 24:1 SM. These
components
have their main gel–fluid transitions at 44.7 and 24.1 °C,
respectively,52 with the BSM mixture having
a broad transition temperature of 35–40 °C.53 The WAXS pattern of BSM:Chol 40:60 mol % shows
a broad fluid peak centered at 4.7 Å. This is in good agreement
with previous WAXS data on BSM:Chol 60:40 mol % mixtures in the fluid
state, which showed a broad fluid peak centered at 4.5 Å at 25
°C.54 Here, the authors also showed
that there is an increase
in the d-spacing with increased cholesterol content,
which provides an explanation for the slight difference between the
two values. While pure BSM is in a gel state at 25 °C, the addition
of >25 mol % cholesterol to SM has been previously shown to cause
a transition from a bilayer gel state to the Lo fluid state.55,56 BSM:Chol mixtures above 50 mol % Chol exist exclusively in the Lo state, as seen in the BSM:Chol data (Figure 7a). Activity of SMase on liposomes formulated
from mixtures of EggSM and Chol is also influenced by this transition.
Specifically, increased SMase activity was observed in EggSM:Chol
50:50 mol % at 37 °C, thought to be in part due to the presence
of the Lo phase, because SMase activity on EggSM in the
gel state is significantly lower.57

Increasing the content of ceramide to mimic the effect of SMase
at a constant Chol mol % led to an increase in the lattice parameter
of 0.6 Å from 0 to 30% conversion of BSM to BC. This agrees well
with previous reports of egg SM and egg ceramide mixtures, where increasing
amounts of ceramide increased the observed lattice parameter.58 As the ceramide content increases from BSM:BC:Chol
40:0:60 to 20:20:60 mol %, a gelling of the bilayer also occurs. This
is characterized by a reduction in the fluid peak in the WAXS data
(Figure 7b inset).
Cholesterol crystals also become visible from 10 mol % conversion
of BSM to BC with the peaks growing in intensity relative to the lamellar
phase as the content of ceramide increases. The cholesterol crystals
are characterized by peaks centered at 34 and 17 Å (SAXS) and
multiple sharp peaks in the wide angle region (WAXS Figure 7b inset). These are in good
agreement with previous literature reports characterizing cholesterol
crystal structure in isolation and lipid systems.52,59

The gelling of the bilayer with increasing ceramide content
indicates
a shift from a fluid lamellar phase toward a disrupted ripple phase
coexisting with cholesterol crystals increasingly visible in both
the SAXS and WAXS data as the mol % of ceramide increases (Figures 7b and S6). Pure SM extracts from milk, brain, and egg
have all shown ripple phase formation below 37 °C and a single
fluid phase above the Tm.60 However, the ripple phase can be difficult to resolve.60 Recently, the formation of the ripple phase
has also been shown in EggSM and egg ceramide (EggCer) mixtures, where
the ripple phase was noted up to EggSM:EggCer 80:20 mol % below 37
°C and at atmospheric pressure.58 The
incorporation of ceramide caused an increase in the ripple period
and thereby a broadening of the ripple. Other research has suggested
that there may be some phase coexistence in the gel phase, although
distinguishing between a poorly resolved ripple and a gel phase coexistence
can be complex.61 In our case, the lack
of a strong gel peak in the WAXS implies that the dominant phase is
the disrupted ripple rather than coexisting gel phases. However, it
is possible that at this lipid composition there is some weak coexistence
of Lo with the ripple gel phase, which is not possible
to resolve because of the broadening of the ripple gel pattern. The
ripple phase we report in the BSM:BC:Chol 20:20:60 mol % mixture is
poorly resolved and disrupted, as indicated by the lack of a sharp
peak in the WAXS data at 4.2 Å; therefore accurate lattice parameter
determination is not possible. We can estimate the lattice parameter
by assuming that the angle between the a and b lattice parameters is 90° so that a is given by the d spacing of the 10 peak and is
approximately 67.2 ± 0.4 Å.60 The 01 peak is broad, suggesting that the ripple is almost flat,
and hence we are unable to estimate the ripple period. The poor resolution
of the ripple phase has been reported previously for other SM extracts,
where highly resolved diffraction patterns of BSM have only been achieved
at 62 °C and 100 MPa.60 The WAXS data
are a further corroboration of a single ripple phase, since a fluid–gel
coexistence in the BSM:BC:Chol mixture would exhibit two SAXS lattice
parameters—unless they were identical—and the gel would
be characterized by a sharp peak in the WAXS region, corresponding
to the ceramide in a gel state.58,62

These observed
changes in the phase behavior of the binary and
ternary mixtures agree well with previous reports on the effects of
cholesterol and ceramides on SM phase behavior. While Chol lowers
the gel–fluid transition temperature in SM mixtures, SMase
causes an increase in the ceramide content of the bilayer, leading
to an eventual increase in the gel–fluid transition temperature
and transition of the bilayer back to a gel state. This is supported
by previous DSC data showing that the gel–fluid melting temperatures
of mixtures of 18:0 and 24:1 SM with 10 mol % of their respective
ceramides showed a series of complex endotherms with increased gel–fluid
transitions when compared to SM alone.53,58

Bulk
and vesicular measurements are generally accepted to be in
good agreement; hence we can infer that the change in phase behavior
due to the increase in BC content within the bilayer would alter the
behavior and stability of extruded liposomes, leading to potential
changes in leakage across the bilayer. NTA measurements of particle
concentration quantification and CryoTEM images support this hypothesis.
At significant SMase-mediated conversion of BSM to BC, global liposome
structural rearrangement and a range of liposome sizes and morphologies
are observed by cryoTEM, and NTA shows a significant drop in particle
concentration (see Figure 4a and b). Here, a large release of encapsulated cysteine is
inevitable.

Detection of SMase Inhibitors
The
ability to rapidly
and sensitively measure inhibitor efficacy has huge implications in
identifying new SMase inhibitors and monitoring in vivo drug concentrations in patients undergoing SMase inhibitor based
treatments. In particular, patients being treated for depression are
at elevated risk of overdose, and it is crucial to quickly identify
such cases so they can be treated in a timely manner. We therefore
investigated the usefulness of our optimized assay for detecting small-molecule
SMase inhibitors. Three known small-molecule SMase inhibitors, desipramine,
cambinol, and altenusin, were incubated at different concentrations
with a fixed activity of SMase (1 mU/mL) for 15 min prior to 1 h of
incubation with BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes. We selected this SMase activity
since it is the minimum activity required for complete AuNP aggregation
under the assay conditions. To quantify the extent of inhibition,
we recorded absorbance spectra 15 min after addition of AuNPs and
calculated the 640/525 nm absorbance ratio. We observed that all three
inhibitors completely inhibited SMase activity at concentrations above
5 μM, whereas we observed no inhibition below around 10 nM concentrations
(Figure 8). The relative
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values that
we observed are in line with relative reported inhibitor activities.
We obtained the IC50 values by fitting the data to the
monophasic dose–response curve:  where x0 is the
concentration corresponding to IC50. Notably, the range
in which desipramine concentration gives a linear response to SMase
activity covers its in vivo concentrations in both
therapeutic and toxic concentrations. Unlike the traditional methods,
our assay screened the drug candidates much quicker (in 90 min,
compared to 3–4 h for conventional assays).

Figure 8 Screening of SMase inhibitors. The inhibitors desipramine, cambinol,
and altenusin were screened using the optimized assay conditions using
BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes. The responses are the average of three independent
measurements, and the error bars represent the standard deviation.

Conclusions
In
summary, we demonstrated here a highly sensitive colorimetric
enzyme assay using AuNPs and cysteine-encapsulating liposomes. The
use of liposomes allows the investigation of enzymes acting on a biologically
relevant substrate, while the use of cysteine to induce aggregation
of AuNPs offers a specific and robust transduction mechanism. Using
liposomes formulated exclusively from naturally occurring lipids to
detect SMase offers a cell-membrane-mimicking environment for the
enzymatic activity. Using this assay, we were able to detect SMase
enzyme concentrations as low as 1.4 pM at room temperature, which
outperforms the commercially available colorimetric assays. Even higher
sensitivity could be achieved with an extended incubation time and
lower particle concentrations. Notably, the assay provides a rapid
change in color tonality as a function of SMase concentration, providing
an efficient means of detecting the enzyme in point-of-care settings.
We have investigated the underlying mechanism of cargo release using
SAXS and WAXS to characterize changes in liposome lipid phase behavior
and observed a fluid–gel structural transition below 50% conversion
of BSM to ceramide. At this transition, it appears that the liposome
membrane becomes significantly more permeable. In addition to determining
the SMase activity, we have also shown the capability of this assay
to rapidly screen SMase inhibitors using colorimetric responses. These
results highlight the advantage of this hybrid approach utilizing
two very different nanomaterials to develop colorimetric sensors for
membrane-active enzymes. The current assay is amenable to different
enzymes requiring appropriate substrates on the liposomal platform.
We expect that this system will have applications in both point-of-care
diagnostic testing and high-throughput pharmaceutical screening of
potential drug candidates.

Materials and Methods
AuNPs
The AuNPs with an average diameter of 13 nm were
prepared using the citrate reduction method.63 Briefly, a solution of sodium citrate (10 mL; 38 mM) was added to
a rapidly stirred boiling aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (100
mL; 1 mM). After 30 min of reflux, the red mixture was allowed to
cool to room temperature. Then, 50 mL of AuNPs was mixed with 2 mL
of 1 wt % surfactant Tween-20 to yield well-dispersed AuNPs that were
collected by filtering through a 0.45 μm membrane and stored
in a refrigerator at 4 °C. The concentration of the prepared
AuNP dispersion was determined with UV–vis spectrometry reported
previously and found to be 12 nM. It should be noted that the Tween-20
additive stabilizes the individual as well as the aggregated AuNPs.
The AuNP stock solution was diluted in DPBS buffer before adding to
the assay solutions.

Lipid Films
SM from bovine brain
(Avanti Polar Lipids,
Alabaster, AL, USA) and cholesterol (Sigma) were dissolved in methanol
and chloroform, respectively, at 10 mg/mL concentrations. Solutions
of BSM:Chol were mixed in ratios of 70:30, 60:40, 50:50 and 40:60
mol % and aliquoted into 1.75 mL glass vials, with a final concentration
of 2 mg (2.7 μmol) BSM per vial. Solvents were evaporated using
a stream of nitrogen gas to give a homogeneous lipid film and dried
further for 12 h in vacuo, then stored sealed in
a nitrogen atmosphere at −20 °C until liposome formulation.

Liposome Formulation
DPBS (1/3×) was prepared
by diluting 1 mL of DPBS without magnesium and calcium (Gibco) in
2 mL of pure water (Gibco). Cysteine solutions of 50, 100 or
200 mM were prepared by diluting cysteine hydrochloride (Sigma) in
1/3× DPBS to 8.8, 17.6 or 35.1 mg/mL, respectively. The
lipid film was hydrated with 1 mL of this cysteine solution for 30
min and agitated on a vortex shaker for 6 × 10 s, after which
the lipid film had fully detached from the vial walls to form a homogeneous
lipid suspension. In the case of liposomes formulated from BSM:Chol
40:60 mol % lipid films (BSM:Chol 40:60 liposomes), the 30 min incubation
followed by 6 × 10 s vortex shaker agitation was repeated twice
before the lipid film was fully detached from the vial sides. The
suspension was extruded 31 times through a 200 or 100 nm pore size
polycarbonate membrane (Whatman Nuclepore) using a microextruder (Avanti
Polar Lipids), affording monodisperse, unilamellar liposomes. The
cysteine/DPBS external media was exchanged for DPBS on a Sephadex
G50 (medium) column, affording the pure liposome formulation at approximately
0.5 mg/mL SM concentration. Liposome particle concentrations were
characterized by NTA measurements. Particle concentration varied very
little from batch to batch and was around 2 × 1012 particles/mL.

Assay Protocol
SMase from Bacillus cereus was diluted in DPBS with 1 mM magnesium
sulfate and 1 mM calcium
chloride to 2× the final assay concentration from a 1:1 DPBS:glycerol
12.5 U/mL stock solution. Liposomes were diluted to 1.7 × 1011 (100 nm diameter) or 3.6 × 1010 (200 nm
diameter) particles/mL in DPBS with 1 mM magnesium sulfate and 1 mM
calcium chloride. In a 96-well plate, 70 μL of liposome suspension
was added to 70 μL of enzyme solutions at varying concentrations
and incubated at rt for 1 h. AuNPs (60 μL) were added, and absorption
at 525 and 640 nm was measured every minute until 20 min using a SpectraMax
M5, at which point absorbance spectra were measured (525–700
nm, Δ 5 nm). SMase from B. cereus was purchased
from Sigma and is structurally and mechanistically similar to mammalian
neutral SMase.64,65

NMR Measurements
Lipid films were prepared in glass
vials with BSM:Chol ratios of 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, and 30:70 mol %
and 2 mg total BSM, as described above. These films were hydrated
with 1 mL of pure water (Gibco) for 30 min and agitated on a vortex
shaker for 6 × 10 s. The incubation/vortex step was repeated
three times before complete detachment of the lipid from the vial
wall. Lipid suspensions were extruded 31 times through a 100 nm polycarbonate
membrane, as described above, lyophilized, and dissolved in 0.5 mL
of deuterated chloroform (Sigma). 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer and analyzed using MestReNova
v12.0. After automatic phase correction and ablative baseline correction
(15 points, 20 passes), the peaks used for analysis were integrated
over fixed regions around the peak maxima. Chemical shifts are quoted
in ppm on the δ scale, using residual solvent as the internal
standard (1H NMR: CDCl3 = 7.26).

SAXS/WAXS Measurements
Brain SM, brain ceramide, and
cholesterol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. These are supplied
in lyophilized powder form with a purity of >99%, so no further
purification
was necessary. Lipids were stored at −20 °C and defrosted
before use. Mixtures of BSM:Chol at 40:60 mol % and BSM:BC:Chol at
36:4:60, 32:8:60, 28:12:60, and 20:20:60 mol % were codissolved in
chloroform, which was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen.
Samples were then lyophilized overnight for a minimum of 12 h to remove
any residual solvent. Mixtures were hydrated in pure water (Gibco)
w/w to 60 wt %, sealed, and heat cycled between −196 and 60
°C a minimum of 10 times. SAXS/WAXS data were obtained at 25
°C at Diamond Light Source, UK, using beamline I22, with samples
mounted in glass capillaries (Capillary Tube Supplies Ltd., SGCT 1.5
mm) at an X-ray wavelength of 0.6902 Å and a sample to detector
distance of 3.7 m. Images were analyzed using the AXcess software
package. Briefly, the two-dimensional SAXS and WAXS images were radially
integrated to give one-dimensional diffraction patterns. The Bragg
peaks were then fitted using Gaussian functions and indexed by comparison
to characteristic peak spacings from known lipid structures.

Inhibitor
Screening
Desipramine, cambinol, and altenusin
were dissolved in DMSO, and stock solutions were prepared, followed
by serial dilutions. In a 96-well clear microplate, 50 μL of
2.8 mU/mL SMase was incubated with 20 μL of inhibitors at different
concentrations at room temperature for 15 min. Then, 70 μL of
1.7 × 1011 particles/mL liposomes was added to the
wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Next, 60 μL
of AuNPs was added, and the absorbance after 15 min of incubation
was recorded. Data fitting was performed in Origin 10 software.
