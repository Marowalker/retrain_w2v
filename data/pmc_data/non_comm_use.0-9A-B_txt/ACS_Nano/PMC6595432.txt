Methodologies
that involve the use of nanoparticles as “artificial
atoms” to rationally build materials in a bottom-up fashion
are particularly well-suited to control the matter at the nanoscale.
Colloidal synthetic routes allow for an exquisite control over such
“artificial atoms” in terms of size, shape, and crystal
phase as well as core and surface compositions. We present here a
bottom-up approach to produce Pb–Ag–K–S–Te
nanocomposites, which is a highly promising system for thermoelectric
energy conversion. First, we developed a high-yield and scalable colloidal
synthesis route to uniform lead sulfide (PbS) nanorods, whose tips
are made of silver sulfide (Ag2S). We then took advantage
of the large surface-to-volume ratio to introduce a p-type dopant (K) by replacing native organic ligands with K2Te. Upon thermal consolidation, K2Te-surface modified
PbS–Ag2S nanorods yield p-type
doped nanocomposites with PbTe and PbS as major phases and Ag2S and Ag2Te as embedded nanoinclusions. Thermoelectric
characterization of such consolidated nanosolids showed a high thermoelectric
figure-of-merit of 1 at 620 K.

Inorganic
nanocrystalline solids
containing two or more different materials and at least one of them
with grain sizes in the nanometer scale can provide significantly
improved mechanical, optical, electrical, and thermal properties.1 Such materials are being employed in a number
of applications including catalysis,2,3 energy-storage
devices such as batteries and capacitors,4 membranes for gas and ion diffusion or molecular separation,5 and energy conversion systems such as fuel cells6 and thermoelectrics.7,8 Because
the desired physical properties of these materials often depend not
only on the individual compositions of constituting phases but also
on the mesoscale microstructure (domain size and mutual arrangement
of grains, grain boundaries, etc.),9−11 chemical and physical processing techniques that control these parameters
are paramount. Toward these goals, the bottom-up formation of such
nanocomposites by the assembly and consolidation of nanoparticles
(NPs) may be a facile, scalable, potentially low cost, and high yielding
as well as extremely versatile, in terms of compositions and morphologies,
method to produce these materials.12,13 A large library
of materials in the form of uniform NP dispersions exists for their
combinatorial blending.8 However, when
it comes to the removal of the solvent and consolidation, a common
hurdle is that the NPs often tend to segregate into clusters of the
same size, shape, or composition.14 A compelling,
broadly applicable strategy to overcome these limitations is to design
heterostructured NPs comprising all desired phases and dopants in
each NP,15 thereby allowing predictable
and uniform nanoscale distribution of these constituents also in the
resulting multicomponent nanosolids (Scheme 1).9,16−19 Herein, we present such a strategy by synthesizing colloidal PbS
rods of tunable lengths with a Ag2S tip on one side. Although
centrosymmetric lead chalcogenides are generally difficult to crystallize
in the anisotropic shape, Ag2S NPs can overcome this limitation
by acting as catalysts for the formation of PbS.

Bottom-up Chemical Engineering of Inorganic Nanosolids
by Assembly and Consolidation of NPs
Heterostructured
NRs with
identical material A at the tips but with long (top) and short (middle)
segments of material B in between allow for uniform distribution of
the material A in the matrix of B. Such a strategy is presented in
this study using colloidal heteronanorods that combine Ag2S (material A tips) with PbS (material B, rods). In contrast, mixing
two separate colloids of materials A and B commonly leads to partial
phase-segregation that is hard to predict and control (bottom image).

Another inherent and, in the context of this
study, very useful
attribute of colloidal nanomaterials is their high surface-to-volume
ratio. On one hand, large specific surface areas are generally found
to be detrimental, as they enhance oxidation20 or induce high densities of defects and uncontrolled impurities.21 On the other hand, NP surfaces may serve as
a gateway22 to introduce needed amounts
of dopants into the resulting semiconducting nanocomposites23−25 or to alter the overall composition.26,27 This convenient
doping strategy and compositional engineerability of NPs can be harnessed
for producing all-inorganic nanosolids with desired electronic properties.
The proper surface treatment methodology needs to be conceived in
each specific case to ensure that the initial insulating organic surfactants
are removed, the surfaces are not oxidized, and controlled impurities
are introduced from the chosen inorganic ligand upon consolidation.
Herein, we outline such surface engineering methodology for colloidal
PbS–Ag2S nanorods (NRs), whose native oleate capping
molecules can be displaced with K2Te as inorganic surface
ligands, eventually producing quintenary Pb–Ag–K–S–Te
nanocomposites after thermal consolidation. We show tunable p-type transport of these composites by controlling the
length of the original NRs, from 0.5 S cm–1 to 5
S cm–1. Additionally, the existence of multiple
grain boundaries in nanocrystalline Pb–Ag–K–S–Te
composites greatly reduce thermal conductivity, from typical bulk
PbS values of ca. 2.5 W m–1 K–1,28 to 0.8 W m–1 K–1 at room temperature (rt).

Results and Discussion
On the
Synthesis and Growth Mechanism of PbS–Ag2S NRs
PbS–Ag2S NRs, each consisting of
a PbS rod and a Ag2S tip, were produced in a three-step
colloidal synthesis. First, monodisperse 2–3 nm Ag NPs (see
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Figure 1a) were produced using a well-established
synthesis route.29 Subsequently, monodisperse
Ag2S NPs (inset of Figure 1a) were prepared at rt by mixing Ag NPs with a solution
of sulfur in oleylamine (OLA:S), nearly instantly leading to the color
change into light-brown, characteristic of Ag2S NPs. In
the last step, PbS–Ag2S NRs (Figure 1b,c) were obtained by injecting the crude
solution of Ag2S NPs, still containing high quantity of
OLA:S, into lead oleate dissolved in octadecene (ODE). Details can
be found in the Methods.

Figure 1 Representative TEM images
of (a) Ag NPs, Ag2S NPs (inset
in a) and (b) the corresponding Ag2S-PbS NRs. (c) HRTEM
image of a single Ag2S-PbS NR.

At one end of every NR an approximately hemispherical tip
can be
discerned by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging (Figures 1c and 2). This tip is identified as an orthorhombic Ag2S phase
(space group P212121) by the detailed crystallographic analysis of the corresponding
power spectrum (FFT). The FFT reveals that the tip has lattice parameters a = 0.6725 nm, b = 0.4148 nm, and c = 0.7294 nm, visualized along its [−103] axis,
and that the NR body consists of a face-centered cubic PbS phase (space
group = Fm3m) with lattice parameter a = 0.5936 nm, visualized along its [001] axis. The inset
in Figure 2a shows
the geometric-phase analysis (GPA) at the interface of both crystallographic
phases. Purple arrows point to the misfit dislocations with a mismatch
calculated from the GPA to be around 30% with respect to a perfectly
relaxed NP. The colored structural map also suggests the epitaxial
relationship between the PbS and the Ag2S phases. The epitaxy
took place with the (020) plane (d020 =
0.207 nm) of Ag2S phase facing the (200) plane (d200 = 0.297 nm) of the PbS phase. The difference
in plane spacing results in a clear misfit, and there are three Ag2S planes for every two PbS planes, which is in good agreement
with the calculated mismatch.

the same previous color code. The top middle inset corresponds to
a GPA analysis obtained on the heterojunction between the PbS and
the Ag2S phases. Purple arrows point to the misfit dislocations.

The narrow size distribution of the PbS–Ag2S
NPs facilitated their assembly into superlattice structures, in particular,
with the perpendicular alignment to the TEM grid. A square two-dimensional
(2D) projection of these NRs can thus be imaged directly (Figure 3). In order to rule
out the presence of cubic PbS NPs, high-angle annular dark-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) micrographs and their
corresponding surface plots (2D intensity profile) have been obtained
(Figure 3c). For the
same composition, HAADF intensity is determined by the probed thickness.
As expected, the surface plot indicates higher intensities from rectangular
profiles (vertically aligned NRs) as compared to elongated profiles
(horizontally lying NRs).

Ag2S is an ionic conductor with a high
concentration
of Ag vacancies and in which Ag cations act as a fluid.30,31 Such behavior has allowed the use of Ag2S NPs as a catalyst
to growth heterostructures of different types of semiconductors, such
as Ag2S–ZnS,32−34 Ag2S–CdS,32,35 and Ag2S–CoS2.36 For the present case of PbS–Ag2S heterostructures,
we assume that Pb ions dissolve in Ag2S and occupy Ag vacancies.
As the concentration of Pb increases to the solubility limit, PbS
cluster nucleates and continues to grow in a fashion similar to well-known
solution–liquid–solid-catalyzed growth.37 Clearly, for a given concentration of Ag2S seeds,
the NR length will be determined by the overall Ag/Pb ratio in the
three-step synthesis described above. Figure 4 illustrates such length tunability from
9 to 44 nm, with the retention of the NR thickness at ca. 9–10
nm. XRD analysis, in agreement with the HRTEM study, corroborates
that the NR growth direction is ⟨100⟩ (Figure 4b). It is important to note
that the formation of anisotropic rodlike morphologies is hard to
accomplish at high yield and good control over the dimensions and
uniformity because this shape is very unusual for Pb chalcogenides
due to their highly symmetric cubic crystal structure. Few known examples
include ultranarrow (1.8 nm) PbS wires produced by decomposition of
lead hexadecylxanthate in trioctylamine;38−40 single-crystalline
PbS nanowires synthesized using a solvothermal reaction, chemical
vapor transport, and gas-phase conversion reaction of pregrown CdS
nanowires;41 PbS nanorods obtained via
sequential cation exchange process;42 and
ultrathin PbS sheets43 or PbSe nanowires44 formed by oriented attachment.

aspect ratios (a), corresponding XRD patterns (b), and dependence
of the NR aspect ratio with respect to the Ag/Pb ratio (c).

An experiment extending the NR
growth time from 3 to 5 min to 1
h illustrates the reduced thermodynamic stability of NRs with respect
to spherical NPs, as can be seen from the conversion of NRs into uniform, ca. 15 nm large spherical PbS NPs (Figure 5). This transition occurs presumably after
all lead oleate and sulfur precursors are consumed for the formation
of NRs. An Ostwald-ripening-like process can be assumed.45,46 A ca. 3 nm large twinned Ag2S tip remains
attached to the PbS NPs (Figure 5c). FFT of the HRTEM image confirmed an orthorhombic
Ag2S phase with lattice parameters a =
0.6725 nm, b = 0.4148 nm, and c =
0.7294 nm, viewed along its [−120] axis; and the fcc PbS phase,
viewed along its [011] axis. In this case, an epitaxial relationship
between the (21–1) plane of Ag2S phase and the (1–11)
plane of PbS phase is also observed, in which there are 4 Ag2S planes for every 3 PbS planes with an overall lattice mismatch
of 4%.

of several spherical NPs; details of the red and green squared regions
and their corresponding FFT. On the right, a colored structural map
is presented, wherein the red color indicates an orthorhombic Ag2S phase and the green color indicates a face-centered cubic
PbS phase.

Surface Chemical Engineering
and Consolidation into Nanosolids
PbS–Ag2S NRs were initially stabilized by long-chain
carboxylate groups, which were subsequently replaced with K2Te (Figure 6a). This
inorganic surface functionalization can be used to introduce a p-type dopant (K) into metal chalcogenides as well as to
adjust the composition by forming either metal telluride phases or
by replacing some sulfur to form solid solutions.27 The ligand-exchange reaction was conducted via a phase-transfer
process, in which PbS–Ag2S NRs migrated from the
nonpolar phase (hexane) to the polar phase (N -methylformamide,
MFA) due to the shift from steric to electrostatic mechanism of colloidal
stabilization. The ligand-exchange process did not alter the XRD pattern
of NRs. However, mild thermal treatments (210 °C, 10 min) induced
an increase of the crystal domain size (SI) in the PbS phase as well as the emergence of a crystalline PbTe
phase (Figure 6b),
associated with the excess of Te2– ions in solution
promoting a partial S2– to Te2– anion exchange.27,47 None of the known silver chalcogenide
crystal phases could be identified by XRD, which can be attributed
to the small crystal domains, low concentration, and the large quantity
of peaks in the characteristic XRD pattern of orthorhombic silver
chalcogenides.48−50

the surface of PbS used in this study. Analogous chemistry is assumed
for Ag2S surfaces, not shown here. (b) XRD patterns of
the as-synthesized (13 ± 1 nm) × (9 ± 1 nm) PbS–Ag2S NRs, the corresponding K2Te-surface modified
NRs right after the ligand exchange (PbS–Ag2S–K 2Te) and after annealing at 210 °C (PbS–Ag2S–K2Te powder); hot-pressed (HP) resulting
pellet (PbS–Ag2S–K 2Te, HP).

K2Te-functionalized
PbS–Ag2S NRs were
used as a precursor for K-doped Pb–Ag–S–Te nanocomposites
(Pb–Ag–K–S–Te), with the aim of constructing
efficient thermoelectric materials. To produce a nanocomposite with
low porosity, precipitated and predried K2Te–PbS–Ag2S NRs were first annealed at 210 °C under argon to fully
remove the physisorbed MFA solvent. Subsequently, the powder was hot-pressed
into 10 mm in diameter and ca. 1 mm thick disk-shaped pellets by applying
a uniaxial pressure of 40 MPa at 380–400 °C for 4 min.
This consolidation yielded Pb–Ag–K–S–Te
nanocomposites with relative densities between ∼90–92%.
Their exact elemental composition was controlled by the rod lengths.
Smaller NRs yield nanocomposites with larger Ag/Pb ratio, since the
size of the Ag2S tip remains unchanged for all NR sizes.
On the other hand, the smaller the NRs the larger is the surface-to-volume
ratio and, hence, the K/Pb and Te/S ratios. Nanocomposites with the
following elemental compositions as determined by ICP and Rietveld
refinement, Pb0.81Ag0.16K0.03Te0.33S0.67 (13 × 9 nm NRs) and Pb0.89Ag0.10K0.01Te0.28S0.72 (20 × 10 nm NRs), were selected for the subsequent thermoelectric
characterization.

To investigate the nanoscale structure, Pb0.81Ag0.16K0.03Te0.33S0.67 nanocomposite
was studied in detail by HRTEM (Figure 7), revealing a large density of nanosized crystalline
domains and interfaces. Largest crystal domains correspond to PbTe
and PbS crystal phases, in agreement with narrow and intense XRD reflections.
A closer look at the crystal structure of some of the nanoscale inclusions
reveals the presence of Ag2S, Ag2Te and PbS
NPs within the Pb–chalcogenide matrix (Figure 7b).

typical inclusions (Ag2Te, Ag2S, PbS).

Electronic and Thermal
Properties
Temperature-dependent
measurements of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficients
are presented in Figure 8 for Pb0.81Ag0.16K0.03Te0.33S0.67 and Pb0.89Ag0.10K0.01Te0.28S0.72 materials. Both nanosolids exhibit
positive Seebeck coefficients indicating a p-type
electronic transport. Smaller NRs yielded nanocomposites with higher
electrical conductivities in the whole temperature range, in agreement
with the higher contents of a dopant (K) in the material produced
with smaller NRs. Correspondingly, larger carrier concentrations were
found for Pb0.81Ag0.16K0.03Te0.33S0.67 (p = 1 × 1019 cm–3) when compared with Pb0.89Ag0.10K0.01Te0.28S0.72 (p = 8 × 1018 cm–3). Several additional reference experiments, described below and
summarized in Figure 9 in terms of transport properties, had confirmed the importance of
each component in the Pb0.81Ag0.16K0.03Te0.33S0.67 nanocomposite. First, the functionalization
with K2Te was excluded and replaced with NH4SCN treatment, thereby reducing the number of elements in a consolidated
material to three (denoted as Pb–Ag–S material). To
exclude Ag, pure PbS NPs were ligand-exchanged with either K2Te (a Pb–K–S-Te material) or NH4SCN (a Pb–S
material).

Figure 8 (a) 13 and 20 nm NRs used to build up Pb0.81Ag0.16K0.03Te0.33S0.67 and Pb0.89Ag0.10K0.01Te0.28S0.72 nanocomposites, respectively, and the corresponding (b) electrical
conductivity, σ, and (c) Seebeck coefficient, S.

coefficient, S; (c) thermal conductivity, κ;
(d) thermoelectric
figure of merit, ZT, of Pb–S, Pb–Ag–S, Pb–K–S–Te,
and Pb–Ag–K–S–Te nanocomposites.

K-free materials (Pb–Ag–S
and Pb–S; open symbols
in Figure 9) are characterized
by lower electrical conductivities and negative Seebeck coefficients
in the whole temperature range. In the case of Pb–Ag–S,
as the temperature increased, a pronounced change at 450 K of the
electrical conductivity as well as the Seebeck coefficient was observed,
which is associated with the phase transition from the low temperature
orthorhombic β-Ag2S to the high-temperature cubic
α-Ag2S phase.51 The high-temperature
phase contains both electrons and Ag ions that are mobile.52 The contribution of Ag ions to the transport
properties increases the electrical conductivity, but their p-type nature induces bipolar effects reducing the absolute
value of the Seebeck coefficient to near −10 μV/K. Despite
the fact that Ag can partially dissolve into Pb chalcogenide and then
act as a p-type dopant,53,54 in our composite Ag doping was not efficient enough to change majority
of carriers in the Pb–Ag–S nanocomposite. On the contrary,
the K2Te treatment induces a change of the type of the
majority carriers in the nanocomposites (Pb–S–K–Te
and Pb–Ag–K–S–Te), seen as a change of
the sign of Seebeck coefficient from negative to positive and larger
electrical conductivities in the whole temperature range indicating
an efficient p-type doping (solid symbols).

Ag-free nanocomposites (blue squares) exhibited larger thermal
conductivities than Pb–Ag–S or Pb–Ag–K–S–Te,
indicating a significant role of Ag for enhanced phonon scattering.
The presence of Ag2S and Ag2Te NPs in the Pb–chalcogenide
matrix with the mutual lattice mismatch might be the reason for a
more efficient phonon scattering. Additionally, the ionic nature of
silver chalcogenides compounds, with high mobility of Ag ions, can
further reduce the thermal conductivity by scattering short-wavelength
phonons.55

On the basis of the measured
electrical conductivities, Seebeck
coefficients, and thermal conductivities, one can estimate a thermoelectric
figure-of-merit (ZT = σS2Tκ–1) of the obtained materials. The highest ZT value of ca. 1 at 620
K was obtained for Pb–Ag–K–S–Te nanocomposites,
which is 3-fold higher with respect to Pb–S–Te nanocomposites.

Conclusions
In summary, a possibility of the fully rational
control of electrical
and thermal characteristics of a multicomponent thermoelectric material,
Pb–Ag–K–S–Te in this study, by the multistep
bottom-up engineering is presented. In particular, shown is the preassembly
of Pb, Ag, and S atoms into a Ag2S–PbS NR morphology
with tunable PbS rod lengths by means of colloidal synthesis from
monodisperse Ag NPs that were consequently converted into Ag2S NP seeds, which are immediately used for formation of PbS rods.
Ag2S–PbS NRs were then surface-functionalized with
K2Te, followed by consolidation into all-inorganic five-component
Pb–Ag–K–S–Te nanomaterials, whose chemical
composition is adjustable by the size of the initial rods. Efficient
suppression of thermal conductivity was attained due to nanoscale
homogeneity of the mixing of the grains of several binary and ternary
crystal phases. Efficient p-type transport was imparted
by efficient substitutional doping with K ions. Overall, the combined
effect of such engineering is a high ZT value of ca. 1 at 620 K.

Experimental Methods
Chemicals and Materials
Lead(II) oxide (PbO, 99.9%),
oleic acid (OA, 90%, technical grade), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%, technical
grade), sulfur (S, 99.998%, trace metals basis), oleylamine (OLA,
min. 95%), silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥ 99.8%), iron(III)
nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 99.99%), K (cubes in mineral oil 99.5%, trace metals basis), Te
powder (99.999%), N-methylformamide (MFA, 99%), and
hydrazine (N2H4) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Anhydrous hexane, ethanol, 2-propanol, and acetone were obtained from
various sources. All chemicals were used as received without further
purification. MFA was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves at room
temperature (rt) under an Ar flow for 20 h and then filtered using
hydrophobic syringe filters. Standard airless techniques were used:
a vacuum/dry argon Schlenk line for synthesis and an argon glovebox
for storage and handling of air- and moisture-sensitive chemicals.

PbS NPs with a mean edge size of 11 nm were prepared similarly
to previously reported procedures.23 In
a typical synthesis, PbO (4.46 g, 20 mmol) and OA (50 mL, 0.158 mol)
were mixed with 100 mL of ODE. This mixture was degassed at rt and
100 °C for 0.5 h each to form the lead oleate complex and remove
low boiling point impurities. Then the solution was flushed with Ar,
and the temperature was raised to 210 °C. At this temperature,
a sulfur precursor, prepared by dissolving elemental sulfur (0.64
g, 20 mmol) in OLA (20 mL, 0.061 mol), was rapidly injected. The reaction
mixture was maintained between 195 and 210 °C for 5 min and then
quickly cooled to rt using a water bath. The obtained NPs were washed
inside the glovebox by three precipitation/redispersion steps using
hexane as solvent and ethanol as nonsolvent. Isolated NPs were dried
under vacuum and then redispersed in hexane for further use.

Synthesis
of Ag/Ag2S NPs/Seeds
Ag NPs with
an average diameter of 2–3 nm were produced using a modified
approach of that reported by Wang et al.29 In a typical reaction, AgNO3 (0.17 g, 1 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.04 g, 0.01 mmol), OA
(10 mL, 31.6 mmol), and OLA (10 mL, 30.5 mmol) were mixed and degassed
under Ar at rt for 0.5 h. Afterward, the reaction mixture was heated
to 120 °C at a rate of 5 °C min–1 and
kept at this temperature for an additional 60 min. To form Ag2S seeds, Ag NPs were mixed with a OLA/S solution (5 mL/0.16
g, 5 mmol). Immediately after OLA/S was mixed with the Ag NPs, the
solution changed color from yellow to light brown, indicating the
formation of Ag2S seeds.

Synthesis of PbS–Ag2S NRs
PbO (1.115
g, 5 mmol), OA (12.5 mL, 0.04 mol), and ODE (25 mL) were combined
in a three-neck flask. This mixture was degassed under vacuum at rt
and 100 °C for at least 0.5 h each to form a lead oleate complex
and to remove low-boiling-point impurities. Then the solution was
flushed with Ar, and the temperature was raised to 180 °C. At
this temperature the OLA/S–Ag solution was rapidly injected
at 180 °C into the lead oleate complex solution. After 3 min,
the reaction mixture was quickly cooled to rt using a water bath.
The obtained NRs were washed inside the glovebox by three precipitation/redispersion
steps using hexane as a solvent and 2-propanol as a nonsolvent. The
washed NRs were dried using vacuum/Ar and then redispersed in hexane
for further use.

K2Te Synthesis
K2Te was synthesized
in liquid ammonia from the elemental potassium and tellurium in stoichiometric
quantities. Typically, 29.2 mmol of K and 14.6 mmol of Te were placed
into a 500 mL Schlenk vessel. Dry ammonia was then condensed into
this reaction vessel, which was cooled with a dried ice/acetone bath.
A beige powder was obtained after complete evaporation of ammonia.
K2Te powder was stored and handled in an Ar-filled glovebox.

Ligand Exchange with K2Te
A 7 mM K2Te solution in MFA was prepared in an Ar-filled glovebox. Anhydrous
hydrazine was added to generate a reducing environment (4 μL
per milliliter of MFA). Equal volumes of K2Te/MFA solution
and hexane solution of NPs (5 mg/mL) were combined in a vial and vigorously
stirred at rt in an Ar-filled glovebox for 16 h. After its complete
discoloration, the hexane phase was decanted and the remaining polar
phase was rinsed with pure hexane. Acetone was added to the remaining
polar phase, and the mixture was centrifuged to precipitate the NPs.
NPs were then washed one more time with acetone, centrifuged, dried
under vacuum, and stored in the glovebox for further use.

Ligand Exchange
with NH4SCN
The native ligands
were removed by mixing 6 mL of a 130 mM NH4SCN solution
in methanol with 1 g of NPs suspended in anhydrous chloroform. NPs
were then purified using chloroform and methanol to remove free carboxylic
acid and excess NH4SCN, respectively.

Consolidation
of NPs into Pellets
In all cases, surface-modified
NPs were dried from solution under vacuum. Afterward, NPs were annealed
at 210 °C on a heating plate in an Ar-filled glovebox for approximately
20 h to remove remaining volatile organics before the pellet fabrication.
NPs powders were pressed using a custom-made hot press. In this system,
the heat was provided by an induction coil operated in the RF range
applied directly to a graphite die acting as a susceptor. This setup
configuration allows increasing temperature at a similar rate as spark
plasma sintering. Inside the glovebox, powders were ground into fine
powder and loaded into a 10 mm diameter graphite die lined with 0.13
mm thick graphite paper. The filled die was placed in the hot press
system. The densification profile applied an axial pressure of ∼40
MPa before the die was heated to 300 °C. The temperature was
held between 400 and 420 °C for 5 min. The pressure was then
removed and the die cooled to room temperature. The resulting pellets
were ca. 90% dense, ca. 1 mm thick,
10 mm in diameter, and air stable. The density of the pressed pellets
was measured by the Archimedes method.

X-ray Diffraction
XRD analysis was performed directly
on the as-synthesized NPs before and after the ligand exchange as
well as after the annealing and on the final pellets. The measurements
were done in a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer equipped with
an M. Braun 50 m position sensitive detector, Bragg–Brentano
geometry, Cu Kα1 radiation (1.54059 Å), focusing Ge monochromator.

(S)TEM Characterization
High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high angle annular dark field scanning
TEM (HAADF STEM) images have been obtained by means of a FEI Tecnai
field emission gun microscope with a 0.19 nm point-to-point resolution
at 200 keV equipped with an embedded Quantum Gatan image filter (Quantum
GIF) for spectrum imaging (SI) EELS analyses.
Images have been analyzed by means of Gatan Digital Micrograph software.
Structure phase color maps have been generated also with the latest
software in order to differentiate the different heterostructures.56

Thermoelectric Characterization
Electrical
Properties
The pressed samples were polished,
maintaining the disk-shape morphology. Final pellets had a 10 mm diameter
and were approximately 1 mm thick. The Seebeck coefficient was measured
using a static DC method. Electrical resistivity data were obtained
by a standard four-probe method. Both the Seebeck coefficient and
the electrical resistivity were simultaneously measured with accuracies
better than 1% in a LSR-3 LINSEIS system from rt to 650 K, under helium
atmosphere. Samples were held between two alumel electrodes and two
probe thermocouples with spring-loaded pressure contacts. A resistive
heater on the lower electrode created temperature differentials in
the sample to determine the Seebeck coefficient. Note: The results presented in the manuscript are an average of the results
obtained after measuring two pellets produced under identical conditions.
The measurements between different samples had standard deviations
below 10%. Additionally, each pellet was measured three times, providing
very little hysteresis between the heating and cooling cycles. The
major difference was found in the first measurement. Therefore, all
of the measurements presented in the manuscript correspond to the
heating cycle of the second measurement.

Thermal Properties
An XFA 600 xenon flash apparatus
was used to determine the thermal diffusivities of all samples with
an accuracy of ca. 6%. Total thermal conductivity (κ) was calculated
using the relation κ = DCpρ,
where D is the thermal diffusivity, Cp is the heat capacity, and ρ is the mass density
of the pellet. The ρ values were calculated using the Archimedes
method. The heat capacity was calculated using the Dulong–Petit
limit, taking into account the different phases of the nanocomposites
and their content considering no alloying/doping.

Hall Measurement
Hall carrier concentrations and mobilities
at rt were measured using a magnetic field of 2 T with a PPMS-9T (Quantum
Design Inc., USA). Values reported correspond to the average of five
consecutive measurements, from which an error of ca. 10% was estimated.
