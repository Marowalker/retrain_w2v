Paper-based
lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) are one of the most
widely used point-of-care (PoC) devices; however, their application
in early disease diagnostics is often limited due to insufficient
sensitivity for the requisite sample sizes and the short time frames
of PoC testing. To address this, we developed a serum-stable, nanoparticle
catalyst-labeled LFIA with a sensitivity surpassing that of both current
commercial and published sensitivities for paper-based detection of
p24, one of the earliest and most conserved biomarkers of HIV. We
report the synthesis and characterization of porous platinum core–shell
nanocatalysts (PtNCs), which show high catalytic activity when exposed
to complex human blood serum samples. We explored the application
of antibody-functionalized PtNCs with strategically and orthogonally
modified nanobodies with high affinity and specificity toward p24
and established the key larger nanoparticle size regimes needed for
efficient amplification and performance in LFIA. Harnessing the catalytic
amplification of PtNCs enabled naked-eye detection of p24 spiked into
sera in the low femtomolar range (ca. 0.8 pg·mL–1) and the detection of acute-phase HIV in clinical
human plasma samples in under 20 min. This provides a versatile absorbance-based
and rapid LFIA with sensitivity capable of significantly reducing
the HIV acute phase detection window. This diagnostic may be readily
adapted for detection of other biomolecules as an ultrasensitive screening
tool for infectious and noncommunicable diseases and can be capitalized
upon in PoC settings for early disease detection.

==== Body
The emergence
of infectious
diseases is one of the greatest threats to human health. The recent
outbreaks of Zika and Ebola viruses and the ongoing HIV pandemic continue
to highlight the need for diagnostic tools that are affordable, sensitive,
simple, and able to rapidly detect pathogens under challenging circumstances.
These demands have led to the uptake of paper-based lateral flow immunoassays
(LFIAs) as the most prominent rapid point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic
tests. Although meeting many of these criteria, their sensitivity
generally falls short of other benchtop protein and nucleic acid detection
methods.1 The continuing hurdle of developing
PoC diagnostics is that compromises must be made between sensitivity,
simplicity, speed, and cost. A great challenge is the development
of diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings that require exceptional
performance in all these categories but also resilience toward a lack
of cold-chain support.

Sensitive diagnostic platforms often
include signal or target amplification
mechanisms, such as polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal
nucleic acid amplification for detection of nucleic acids or enzyme-catalyzed
signal amplification and immuno-PCR for detection of protein targets.2,3 However, these techniques are relatively resource demanding, requiring
technical expertise to run and interpret (e.g., purification
steps) and utilize equipment that is often incompatible with use in
resource-limited settings where unreliable power supplies and maintenance
challenges restrict their use.4,5 Due to their high catalytic
efficiency and extraordinary stability in harsh environments, such
as high temperature and extreme pH, mixed noble-metal catalytic nanoparticles
have emerged as promising materials for signal amplification in colorimetric
immunoassays.6−11 We show here that incorporating inorganic nanoparticle catalysts
in lateral-flow testing formats, through an investigation of their
size and porosity, provides a pathway to significantly improve the
sensitivity of simple to read, absorbance-based LFIAs. This has resulted
in a simple and cost-effective paper based diagnostic test with a
level of performance far in advance of current standards for LFIA.

Here, we integrate peroxidase-mimicking porous platinum core–shell
nanocatalysts (PtNCs) into a LFIA for sensitive detection of p24,
the viral capsid protein of HIV. Acute HIV infection poses a unique
challenge in diagnosis as it encompasses a period from initial infection
to complete seroconversion (the period over which patient antibodies
against proteins of HIV develop). During this window period, there
is a lack of detectable circulating biomarkers, with antibodies appearing ca. 28 days after infection.12,13 HIV p24 is
the earliest protein biomarker post infection, and a test capable
of detecting p24 earlier would be transformative in key target settings,
such as the diagnosis of infants whose mothers are known to be HIV
positive, where antibody tests are unreliable, and also to ensure
early intervention with antiretroviral therapies where they have the
potential to be most beneficial.14−17 However, clinically relevant
ranges of p24 during acute infection are far below the detectable
limit of the leading field-ready colorimetric LFIA tests (ca. 10–15 pg·mL–1),18−20 which are limited by the absorbance of the colored label and the
affinities of the antibody recognition components.21

Through the design and optimization of a nanocatalyst
amplification
platform, high-affinity and orthogonally designed binding components,
and lateral flow architecture, we demonstrate a high level of sensitivity
and broad dynamic range previously unattainable in LFIA formats. The
catalytic amplification process developed herein allows the test,
in spiked serum, to surpass the published sensitivity of the leading
commercial rapid tests for p24 (Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo
and Alere HIV Combo, for example) by a factor of up to 20. Here, we
show detection of low femtomolar concentrations of p24 in spiked serum
(ca. 32.5 fM), and naked-eye detection of acute stage
HIV in clinical plasma samples in under 20 min.

Results and Discussion
The LFIA is used to quickly establish whether a target analyte
is present in a complex sample (blood, plasma, sera, etc.) using a simple colorimetric readout. The core process in a LFIA
initiates when a detection label (typically an intensely colored nanoparticle)
is hydrated by the sample, drawn along the paper membrane by capillary
action and bound, via a target analyte, to a region
of the strip called the test line. To achieve this, both the nanoparticles
and the test line must be decorated with affinity ligands (typically
antibodies) capable of binding discrete regions of the target analyte.
In order to achieve a high level of sensitivity in a LFIA format,
the components must exhibit fast binding reaction kinetics toward
the solid-phase to ensure that the particle labels can bind to the
test line within the short time window during which the sample is
flowing past. The use of a high affinity binding system like biotin–streptavidin
(KDca. 10–15 M) for the test line binding capture step is essential for moving
toward the goal where all target antigens are labeled with a nanoparticle
at the test line.22 The advantage of this
architecture means that the antibody-binding complex forms in solution
such that the biotin–streptavidin interaction is the rapid
binding event which immobilizes the complex at the test line. This
circumvents the often poor performance of conventional antibody capture,
as the biotin–streptavidin binding affinity is over 4 orders
of magnitude higher than a conventional antibody–antigen interaction.23

ur PtNC amplified LFIA takes advantage
of the simple, low cost
LFIA platform but incorporates a strong amplification mechanism through
the catalytic activity of the nanoparticle itself to increase the
signal intensity through local deposition of dyes at the test line.
The schematic in Figure 1a highlights the essential components and configuration of the PtNC
amplified LFIA. During the assay, a plasma (or serum) sample is introduced
into a vessel containing both lyophilized antibody modified PtNCs
and agile, orthogonally biotinylated camelid antibody fragments (nanobody-biotin)
capable of binding to discrete epitope regions of the p24 capsid protein.
Next, a lateral flow strip, composed of a nitrocellulose reaction
membrane and an absorbent pad, is used to draw the solution up the
strip toward a streptavidin bearing test line by capillary action.
Where present, p24 in the sample can then be sandwiched between the
antibody–PtNC conjugate and a biotinylated antibody fragment,
forming a biotinylated complex that is captured at the streptavidin
coated test line. At high target concentrations (100−10000
pg·mL–1 p24), a clear black line is visible
with the naked eye due to the intrinsic absorbance of the particles
bound at the test line, indicating a positive test result. Lower concentrations
of the target are visualized by taking advantage of the catalytic
amplification of the PtNCs that act to disproportionate H2O2, enabling the oxidation of a chromogenic substrate.24−27 After running the plasma sample through, followed by a chase buffer,
the test line is exposed to a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a chromogenic
substrate. Any PtNC captured on the test line will oxidize the substrate,
generating an insoluble colored product. This amplification step increases
the window of sensitivity and lowers the detection limit by 2 orders
of magnitude. Because of the unambiguous colored product deposited
at the test line, the assay result can be easily read by eye or captured
by a mobile phone camera for analysis, with the potential for semiquantitative
result readout with a pre- and postamplification signal regime.

Figure 1 (a) Scheme
showing amplified LFIA, where functionalized Pt nanocatalysts
(PtNCs) and biotinylated nanobody fragments are mixed with a plasma
or serum sample. In the presence of a target, PtNCs become biotinylated
through complexation with the target, and rapid high affinity biotin–streptavidin
binding enables a [target] dependent deposition of PtNC at the test
line. PtNCs bound at the test line catalyze the oxidation of CN/DAB
(4-chloro-1-naphthol/3,3′-diaminobenzidine, tetrahydrochloride)
substrate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide producing an insoluble
black product which is clearly visible with the naked eye. (b) Scheme

cysteine mutation (red), where lysine residues are highlighted in
orange on the structural model (left), and cartoon of oriented elements
at the streptavidin test line. (c) Schematic comparing the dynamic
ranges of fourth-generation LFIA, ELISA, and PtNC LFIA.

Figure 1b outlines
the site-selective modification strategy used to prepare robust antibody
fragments with oriented biotin presentation in the assay. Specifically,
we have integrated a thermally robust and high-affinity nanobody component
into the nanocatalyst-labeled LFIA. Nanobodies are single domain antibody
fragments that contain a complete antigen-binding site but are one
tenth the size of a conventional antibody. In addition to their small
size and stable conformation, they can be efficiently mass produced
in bacteria with site-selective mutations that enable biorthogonal
chemistry.28,29 Because of the ease and control
over nanobody modification and purification, we chose to biotinylate
a p24-binding nanobody validated against a broad spectrum of HIV subtypes
to facilitate PtNC–analyte complex binding to the streptavidin
test line.30

An anti-p24 nanobody
containing a solvent-accessible terminal cysteine
residue was expressed to enable site-selective biotinylation. The
position of the cysteine residue, at the end of a flexible 6-mer HIS-tag
linker, was chosen to maximize the distance between the subsequent
modification and the paratope of the nanobody (structural model in Figure 1b), thus minimizing
disruption.30 Site-selective biotinylation
of the cysteine residue was achieved through reaction with a biotin-functionalized
pyridazinedione (PD), the first example of nanobody modification using
PD chemistry (Supplementary Methods and Characterization). Analysis of the nanobody postmodification using LCMS confirmed
addition of only a single molecule of biotin, evidencing no undesirable
off-target conjugation. Pyridazinediones have a proven track record
in antibody modification, and hold many advantages over other cysteine-selective
reagents such as maleimides and haloacetamides, which have been shown
to react with lysine residues andw often display poor long-term stability.31−100 Through this approach, we have specifically engineered the nanobody
to present biotin away from the p24 binding region, enabling oriented
presentation in our assay.

We examined the binding kinetics
of the modified and unmodified
nanobodies with p24 and found that the site-selective modification
had no significant impact on the dissociation constant, confirming
that the modification does not interfere with the antigen binding
region (Supplementary Table 1). The site-selectively
biotinylated nanobody circumvents the nonspecific modification of
the nanobody paratope, which is rich with lysine residues (highlighted
in orange in Figure 1b), where standard carbodiimide cross-linker modification strategies
will risk interfering with the binding site and thus knock out activity.
The site-selective biotinylation of the cysteine presenting nanobody
preserves epitope recognition and ensures efficient use of the p24
available in the sample. We selected a monoclonal antibody (anti-HIV-1/2,
Capricorn products), which is a p24 binding pair with the nanobody–biotin,
to physically adsorb onto the nanocatalysts.30 This coupling of orthogonally modified nanobody and physisorbed
whole IgG antibody enabled the rapid engineering of a PtNC amplified
assay. Nanobody mutation, expression, and orthogonal modification
can be readily achieved within several days where the preparation
of the appropriate PtNC catalysts can be performed simultaneously
for use on a standard, commercially available streptavidin lateral
flow membrane (Supplementary Figure 1).

Figure 1c highlights
the broad dynamic range of PtNC amplified LFIA, which spans over 4
orders of magnitude. This dual sensitivity regime is enabled by the
inherent coloration of the PtNC (for detection of 100–10000
pg·mL–1 analyte) and their ability to catalytically
generate a colored product to decorate the test line, accessing a
second regime from 100 to less than 1 pg·mL–1 analyte. This is ca. 2 orders of magnitude broader
dynamic range than standard colorimetric ELISAs or fourth generation
LFIAs, which are limited to either postcatalysis or to the coloration
of a particle label, respectively.35

In order to produce PtNCs with high catalytic activity and effective
antibody modification, their synthesis required careful optimization.
At the early stages of production, the particles are capped with polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) to ensure colloidal stability (Supplementary Figure 2) and to reduce the extent of fouling that occurs upon
exposure to complex media during LFIA. The molecular weight of PVP
used during the particle synthesis played an important role in dictating
the catalytic activity of the PtNCs (before antibody modification)
as highlighted by their ability to oxidize tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
in Figure 2a, with
10 kDa PVP-capped particles performing optimally. A key performance
requirement of the antibody-capped PtNCs is that they can retain their
catalytic activity following exposure to complex environments such
as patient serum, which contains ca. 7 wt % protein.
Indeed, PtNCs when prepared in this manner with 10 kDa PVP and antibody
modification were found to retain a significant amount of the initial
particle activity (ca. 75%) over a period of 24 h
(Figure 2b), far in
excess of the exposure time expected during a serological measurement.
Although protein adsorption to the PtNCs can reduce the catalytic
activity of the particles, it has the benefit of making their modification
with antibodies simple, where mixing the PtNCs with antibodies in
the correct stoichiometry and at an appropriate pH yields PtNCs with
efficiently conjugated antibodies (Supplementary Figure 3).

nM; F, 0.08 nM; G, 75 pM ca. 120 nm PtNCs as seeds;
H, 40 pM ca. 120 nm PtNCs as seeds. (e) Intensity
of test line for antibody modified PtNCs (150 pM) varying in size
from ca. 50 to 280 nm (mean number distribution by

with 5 min development in CN/DAB and H2O2. All
data are averaged from ≥3 independent measurements where error
bars represent the standard deviation from the mean.

TEM images in Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure 4 show the
precise control over PtNC size and monodispersity possible using the
seeded synthesis. PtNCs could be produced with porous, polycrystalline
platinum shells.37,38 We have observed that there is
a significant contribution to the PtNC catalytic activity that arises
from the internal catalytic surface area of the particles as shown
by assessing the role of gold core size for 15 and 40 nm cores (Supplementary Figure 5). This additional surface
area is accessible through nanometer-scale pores (ca. 1–2 nm by TEM image analysis) within the platinum shell.
This likely renders the pores inaccessible to larger molecules (e.g., antibodies and serum proteins), but accessible to
smaller molecules such as H2O2, making them
well suited for use in catalytic amplification processes following
exposure to protein-rich serum environments.

Selecting the smaller
15 nm gold nanoparticles as seeds, PtNCs
were produced with diameters up to approximately 280 nm by modulating
the concentration of gold seeds used for subsequent overgrowth (Figure 2d). Particles larger
than ca. 150 nm were produced via a layer-by-layer deposition of platinum on as-synthesized ca. 120 nm PtNCs. High-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM)
images of PtNCs of varying size with corresponding energy dispersive
X-ray point spectra (EDS) confirm core–shell structure, with
Au core and Pt confined to the external porous shell (Supplementary Figure 6 and 7). Thanks to the
well-defined concentration of nucleation points for overgrowth with
platinum, the polydispersity as measured by dynamic light scattering
was maintained at a low level (0.01 < PDI < 0.1) ensuring reproducibility
in their synthesis (Supplementary Figure 8). The fine size control of this seeded synthesis allows for control
over subsequent antibody modification.

PtNCs provide an ideal
platform for assessing the role of catalytic
particle size on sensitivity in LFIA by virtue of their core–shell
configuration and their high porosity and the resulting large surface
area for catalysis that is retained independent of the particle size.
The nanometer-scale roughness and morphology of the particles produced
during this seeded synthesis appeared unchanged with increasing size
(Supplementary Figures 4 and 6). The size
of the nanocatalyst has a distinct effect on the test line signal
intensity obtained for PtNC sizes up to ca. 280 nm
when employed in the LFIA. Larger particles with increased surface
area for catalytic reactions would be expected to generate a higher
signal in LFIA format, and indeed, up to a point, this was observed
experimentally. PtNC sizes ranging 50 to 280 nm were synthesized and
modified with an optimal surface density of antibody (Supplementary Figure 3). Keeping the PtNC concentrations
constant (150 pM), the different sized PtNCs were used as catalytic
labels in the LFIA format for serum samples spiked with 100 pg·mL–1 p24 and the biotinylated nanobody. The resulting
variation in signal intensity as a function of particle size is shown
in Figure 2e. Larger
particles were found to result in increased signal intensity reflecting
the increased surface area available for catalytic reactions. However,
we observed that this effect was most prominent approaching a threshold
in the region of 150 nm, above which a reduced performance was observed.
This reduced signal intensity for larger particles may be due to a
reduction in diffusivity and a concomitant decrease in internal porosity
(and therefore catalytic activity), resulting from the layer-by-layer
synthesis (Supplementary Figure 7). An
optimal performance regime was exhibited by PtNCs in the 120–200
nm diameter range, so due to their facile one-step synthesis, low
nonspecific binding, and minimizing the need to use excessive platinum,
120 nm PtNCs were used for further experiments.

Looking toward
the challenges of translation, we investigated both
the reproducibility and stability of the test reagents. Figure 3a shows the test line intensity
produced by five independently synthesized batches of ca. 120 nm PtNCs for detection of 50 pg·mL–1 p24 spiked sera (Supplementary Figure 8). The red line indicates the average test line intensity across
batches. The coefficient of variation between five independently synthesized
and antibody modified batches was 2.4%, indicating that PtNC amplified
LFIA is reproducible through the synthesis, antibody conjugation,
and assay running steps. This suggests that our nanocatalyst platform
holds great promise for reliable clinical sample detection.

of PtNCs (ca. 120 nm) for detection of 50 pg·mL–1 p24 in FBS with 5 min development in CN/DAB and H2O2. Red line indicates average test line intensity
for triplicate measurements across all batches. Coefficient of variation
(n = 5) was 2.4%. (b) Intensity of test line (for
detection of 500 pg·mL–1 p24-spiked plasma)
against days of test component aging at 44 °C or room temperature
(RT). For the aging experiment, nanobody–biotin and either
PtNC or HRP–antibody conjugates were lyophilized in appropriate
buffers and incubated at specified temperature. At aging time points,
spiked plasma was added to the vessel of freeze-dried components and
flowed up the LFIA test strip followed by catalytic amplification.

Stability is a key aspect of PoC
devices where the performance
of both the detection labels and the antibody components must be independent
of the storage conditions the test might be exposed to. Many assays
require controlled temperature storage conditions, which imposes cost
on the supply chain and may prevent use in high temperature regions,
thus limiting the test’s use in the developing world. Enzymes
and antibody reagents are typically the most susceptible components
to long-term storage, although with appropriate drying conditions
and matrices, long-term dried storage is possible.36 Accelerated aging studies, shown in Figure 3b, were carried out on lyophilized reagents–comparing
the stability of peroxidase-mimicking PtNC labels to their biological
counterpart horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the most common enzyme used
for catalytic amplification in immunoassays. For aging studies, nanobody–biotin
and either antibody-conjugated HRP or PtNC were lyophilized in buffer
mixtures containing sucrose, BSA, PVP, and Tween-20. After freeze-drying
and aging at 44 °C or room temperature over a period
of 6 weeks, p24 spiked plasma was added to the dried samples and flowed
up the strip, and the test line intensity was quantified after catalytic
amplification. PtNC-amplified LFIA showed no notable change in test
line intensity over 6 weeks aging at room temperature, and only minimal
change in test line intensity when incubated at 44 °C for 6 weeks (6-month room temperature aging equivalent). An initial ca. 25% decrease in signal intensity was observed after
3 days of incubation at 44 °C, after which no additional signal
was lost over a 42-day period. In contrast, anti-HIV-1/2 antibody-functionalized
HRP labels were found to lose 90% of signal intensity after 2 weeks
of room temperature dry storage when run in LFIA (these samples did
not withstand elevated temperature aging conditions). The resilience
of these components is critical in determining the systems suitability
for PoC use, especially in resource-limited settings where cold-chain
transport is not guaranteed. In particular, this highlights the benefit
of using robust inorganic catalytic nanoparticles in the place of
conventional enzymes where the catalytic amplification obtained using
the porous PtNCs is highly resilient to rapid aging. Conventional
antibodies can be readily physisorbed onto metallic nanoparticles
and show significant thermal stability when lyophilized. We also observe
excellent long-term stability of the biorecognition components in
our amplified LFIA, where we employ a combination of a conventional
antibody and a biotinylated nanobody. However, we note that nanobodies
exhibit significantly greater thermal stability than conventional
immunoglobulins (Supplementary Figure 9) and we see great potential in pairing two nanobody components in
this system to further improve the thermal stability for use in the
most adverse conditions.37−41

The sensitivity of the nanocatalyst-labeled LFIA (employing ca. 120 nm PtNC labels) before and after catalysis is highlighted
in Figure 4a with a
plot of the signal intensity and the concentration of p24 in spiked
sera before and after catalytic amplification. Test line signal intensity
was captured by a mobile phone camera, a readily available tool for
image acquisition. Unlike enzyme-labeled immunoassays which require
catalysis for visualization, the PtNC-labeled LFIA achieves two windows
of sensitivity, pre- and postcatalysis, taking advantage of both the
absorbance of the particles and their peroxidase-mimicking activity
(Supplementary Figure 10). This empowers
the assay with a dual range diagnostic regime, quantifiable by use
of mobile phone-based detection and image analysis. Our assay exhibits
a linear dynamic range across over 4 orders of magnitude from 10000
to <1 pg·mL–1 protein target (Figure 4b) through measurement pre-
and post-amplification. This can enable a broader potential quantitative
range of the test if an image is taken before and after chromogen
amplification. PtNC-amplified LFIA can enable the detection of p24
in spiked sera down to a level of 0.8 pg·mL–1 (ca. 32.5 fM) in under 20 min, which is within
the clinically relevant range for [p24] during acute stage infection
when the individual is most infectious but also when early intervention
with antiretroviral therapies is most beneficial.17

amplification (red) in a mixture of CN/DAB and H2O2 for 5 min using ca. 120 nm PtNC labels.

fit (predevelopment: 0.62x + 1.7, R2 = 0.9813; postdevelopment: 0.61x + 3.0, R2 = 0.9853). (c) Clinical sample HIV seroconversion panel results
for a single donor showing the change in test line intensity as a

containing lyophilized test reagents and run up the LFIA strip followed
by catalytic amplification. Red dotted line indicates cutoff (average
test line intensity of 3 nonspiked blank plasma samples plus three
times standard deviation). Error bars represent standard deviation
from three independent experiments.

We evaluated the performance of the PtNC LFIA in clinical
human
plasma samples using an HIV seroconversion panel collected by ZeptoMetrix
(Panel Donor No. 75062). Longitudinal clinical samples from the same
donor spanning a one-month blood collection period encompassing seroconversion
were assessed. In a blinded experiment, PtNC amplified LFIA could
successfully detect positive antigen levels in infected plasma from
ZeptoMetrix panel samples 7 through 14 corresponding to increasing
levels of antigen in the blood during acute phase infection, followed
by immune complex formation (Figure 4c). Panel samples 13 and 14 correspond to low levels
of p24: 10.8 pg·mL–1 ∼ 211000 copies/mL
HIV-1 RNA and 4.6 pg·mL–1 ∼ 46300 copies/mL,
respectively (verified by ZeptoMetrix HIV p24 antigen ELISA and Roche
Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor). A fourth-generation HIV LFIA test incorporates
an antibody detection line to ensure the test can detect HIV infection
across the seroconversion regime. We envisage a similar approach with
the PtNC-amplified LFIA which would still benefit from the increased
dynamic range for immune response monitoring but also exceptional
levels of sensitivity toward p24 at the early stages of infection.

Conclusions
Here we report one of the simplest and most sensitive absorbance-based
LFIA for protein detection to date, demonstrate its utility in a clinically
significant range for p24 detection in spiked sera and plasma, and
detection of acute phase HIV infection in serial clinical samples.
We achieve sensitivity in a simple paper-based platform by pairing
porous catalytic inorganic nanoparticles and thermally robust antibody
fragments with easily modifiable functional groups for oriented presentation
of the solid phase recognition elements. Capitalizing on the porous
nature of the catalyst, we establish the optimal size regime for catalytic
nanoparticles as amplifying labels in LFIA. We balance the high catalytic
activity of the noble metal PtNCs toward peroxide disproportionation
with the simultaneous tendency for biomolecules to adsorb and block
the reactive surface by careful tailoring of PVP coatings and antibody
conjugation. We demonstrate the utility of both nanobody and nanocatalyst
components in LFIA to move toward a simple, robust, and highly amplifying
system. The result is a PtNC amplified LFIA that is easy to use with
a colorimetric output that can be read by the naked-eye or by mobile
phone camera. The applications for this rapid test with broad dual
dynamic range extend far beyond HIV diagnostics. This sensitive platform
can be readily adapted for detection of other biomarkers across multiple
stages of disease progression and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.
Our versatile and modular platform incorporates highly efficient inorganic
catalytic labels into existing LFIA technology, enhancing its potential
uptake into PoC diagnostics for the detection of any protein target.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticle
Seeds
Gold nanoparticle
seeds with a diameter of ca. 15 nm were synthesized
by sodium citrate reduction of HAuCl4. In a typical synthesis,
10 mL of gold(III) chloride trihydrate aqueous solution (20 mM, Sigma)
was added to 180 mL of purified water under reflux at 100 °C.
The temperature was then reduced to 70 °C, and the reaction initiated
by fast injection of 10 mL of trisodium citrate dihydrate (68 mM,
BDH Chemicals) with vigorous stirring and refluxed for 5 min. The
resulting ca. 15 nm gold nanoparticle (AuNP) seeds
were cooled to room temperature and subsequently stored at 4 °C
(Supplementary Figure 2). Seed concentration
was determined by TEM size analysis and initial gold concentration.

Synthesis of Porous Platinum Core–Shell Nanoparticles
(PtNCs)
120 nm PtNCs were synthesized via reduction of chloroplatinic acid hydrate on gold seeds adapted from
Gao et al.(9) In a typical
synthesis, 31 μL (10 nM) of 15 nm Au seeds were mixed with 969
μL of purified water (Milli-Q), followed by addition of 20 μL
of 20 wt % poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP MW 10 kDa, Sigma). The solution
was vortexed briefly and incubated for 5 min for the polymer to coat
and stabilize particles. l-Ascorbic acid (40 μL, 100
mg·mL–1, Sigma) was then added to the mixture
followed by 40 μL of chloroplatinic acid hydrate (100 mM, Sigma),
mixed, and immediately incubated at 65 °C for 30 min until the
color of the solution changed from red to brown/black indicating successful
deposition of platinum (Supplementary Figure 2). PtNCs were then cooled to room temperature in a water bath, and
excess reagents were removed through four sequential washing cycles
at 1250 rcf for 12 min with resuspension into purified water. PtNC
size in the range of 50–120 nm was controlled by changing the
volume of Au seed solution while keeping the amount of PVP, ascorbic
acid, and H2PtCl6 constant.

PtNCs larger
than 120 nm (mean number distribution by DLS) were synthesized via a stepwise layer-by-layer platinum reduction and deposition
approach. 120 nm PtNCs were used as seeds for subsequent deposition
of platinum layers iterating on the above synthesis to achieve colloidally
stable PtNCs up to ca. 280 nm.

Characterization
of Nanoparticles
Dynamic light scattering
(DLS, Zeta Sizer Nanoseries, Malvern Instruments, Ltd.) was used to
characterize the hydrodynamic radius of nanoparticles. Absorption
measurements were recorded on a SpectraMax M5 multimode microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Ltd.). For electron microscopy characterization,
samples were drop-casted onto carbon-coated copper grids (Electron
Microscopy Sciences), and TEM imaging was performed using a JEOL 2100Plus
or JEOL 2100F operating at 200 kV. High angle annular dark field (HAADF)
images were acquired in scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) mode using a camera length of 10–12 cm (HAADF5) on JEOL
2100F. The microscope was equipped with Gatan Orius SC 1000 (2 ×
4k) high-angle annular dark field detector, Gatan annular dark field
detector/bright field detector. Small camera length ensured that diffraction
contrast was excluded from the imaging and contrast was related to
the atomic number (Z) or density of the particles. Corresponding elemental
compositional mapping of PtNCs was determined by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in STEM mode.

Preparation of PtNC–antibody
Conjugates
In a
typical conjugation, 200 μL of 120 nm PtNC (300 pM) was mixed
with 20 μL of HEPES buffer (pH 6, 0.1 M) followed by addition
of 2 μL of a 23 μM solution of monoclonal anti-HIV-1/2,
purified (Capricorn Products, HIV-018-48303); optimization of [Ab]:[PtNC]
is outlined in Supplementary Figure 3.
The mixture was incubated for 3.5 h under shaking (800 rpm) at 20
°C for antibody physisorption. Modified particles were subsequently
blocked by addition of 200 μL of blocking solution: 2 wt % β-casein
from bovine milk (Sigma) in PBS for 1.5 h under shaking (800 rpm)
at 20 °C. Excess reagents were removed through three wash steps
in assay running buffer (0.2 wt % β-casein, 0.2 wt % Tween20
[Sigma] in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2). Particles were ultimately
resuspended in particle storage buffer (10 wt % sucrose [Sigma], 1
wt % bovine serum albumin [BSA, Sigma], 1 wt % PVP 10 kDa, 0.1 wt
% beta-casein, 0.1 wt % Tween20 in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2).

Horseradish peroxidase was also modified with anti-HIV-1/2 antibody
following Lightning-Link Horseradish Peroxidase kit (Innova Biosciences)
with no deviation from the manufacturer’s protocol.

Evaluation
of Peroxidase-like Activity
All assays were
carried out at room temperature in a 96-well plate (Corning UK). For
stability and activity of PtNCs in complex environments, 10 μL
of PtNCs or antibody modified PtNCs (300 pM) were mixed with 90 μL
of either deionized water, 2 wt % β-casein in PBS, fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Sigma), or human plasma pool (Lee Biosciences) for up
to 24 h at room temperature. PtNCs were further diluted in purified
water to 5 pM for catalytic activity test. For activity tests, 10
μL of PtNCs (5 pM) diluted in purified water were added to a
microwell plate followed by addition of 200 μL of 1-Step Ultra
TMB ELSA Substrate Solution (Thermo Scientific). The absorbance of
the reaction solution at 652 nm was monitored up to 25 min after addition
of substrate.

Production of Cysteine-Presenting Nanobody via Site-Directed Mutagenesis of an Existing Nanobody
The C-terminus
of a validated nanobody against p24, 59H10, characterized in Gray et al., comprises an alanine spacer, myc and His6 tags.30 To insert a Cys residue in this
region to generate ···HHHHHHCZ the following primers
were used with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent)
following the manufacturer’s instructions, verified by sequencing,
and the resultant cysteine presenting nanobody purified as described
previously.30

F: GCCGCACATCATCATCATCATCATTGCTAATGAGAATTCACTGG

R: CCAGTGAATTCTCATTAGCAATGATGATGATGATGATGTGCGGC

Mutations were verified by sequencing.

Site-Selective Modification
of Nanobody
Site-selective
modification of the cysteine presenting nanobody was achieved through
reaction of the reduced nanobody with bromopyridazinedione-PEG8-biotin. Synthesis and characterization (NMR, IR, LRMS, HRMS)
of pyridazinedione–biotin, and subsequent site-selective modification
of the cysteine-mutated nanobody (shown by LCMS, SDS-PAGE) is described
in the Supporting Information.

Characterization
of Antibody Components
Affinity constants
for antibody components were measured on Octet RED96 instrument (Pall
ForteBio LLC, as previously described in Gray et al.).30

Preparation of PtNC-Amplified
Lateral Flow Immunoassay
The lateral flow strips with polystreptavidin
test line were manufactured
by Mologic Ltd. (UK) (Batch Number ML-ICL-130317). The strips were
33 mm long and 5 mm wide. The distance between the test line and the
bottom of the strip was 7 mm. Clinical utility of assay was tested
on human plasma from HIV Seroconversion Panel Donor No. 75062 (ZeptoMetrix
Corp., product code: HIV9079). Donor source plasma was collected from
a U.S. licensed blood collection facility. Donor was untreated and
asymptomatic throughout the collection period. A 50 μL portion
of each panel sample was run on PtNC LFIA (outlined below).

All PtNC lateral flow assays for p24 detection were performed by
submerging a polystreptavidin strip into a 96-well plate containing
the following solution in each well: 10 μL of nanobody–biotin
(200 nM), 50 μL p24 spiked into: FBS; plasma; or infected patient
clinical plasma sample; and 15 μL PtNC antibody conjugate (300
pM). When the solution had fully wicked up the strip (ca. 10 min), the strip was moved into another well filled with 100
μL of assay running buffer for 3 min to wash through any residual
serum (which may contain peroxidases that can also perform catalysis).
Next, the strip was immersed in another well for 5 min filled with
330 μL (enough solution to cover test line on strip in well)
freshly prepared PtNC development solution containing a modified Pierce
CN/DAB (4-chloro-1-naphthol/3,3′-diaminobenzidine, tetrahydrochloride)
Substrate Kit (Thermo Scientific) adjusted with hydrogen peroxide
solution 30% (w/w) (Sigma) to a final added peroxide concentration
of 4 M. Finally, the strip was moved into a well containing 330 μL
purified water for 1 min to stop the reaction. Strips were imaged
with an iPhone 6 mobile phone camera for all experiments, except the
clinical samples, which were imaged using a camera (Canon PowerShot
G15) approved for use in contained environment for handling infectious
samples. Images of strips were acquired 5 min after removal from the
water.

Preparation of Aged Samples for Accelerated Stability Testing
An accelerated aging test was carried out to simulate real-time
shelf life aging. All aging experiments were performed in a nonbinding
96-well plate (Corning, UK). In each well, 15 μL of either PtNC–antibody
conjugate (300 pM) or HRP–antibody conjugate (50 nM) in particle
storage buffer was added, followed by 10 μL nanobody–biotin
(200 nM) and 50 μL of particle storage buffer. Plates were immediately
frozen at −80 °C for 30 min and freeze-dried overnight.
When removed from the freeze-dryer, plates were stored in a sealed
plastic bag filled with silica bead desiccant at either room temperature
or 44 °C for accelerated aging study. Aging at 44 °C for ca. 42 days is functionally equivalent to room temperature
(23 °C) aging for 6 months. Aging conditions were selected following
guidelines of ASTM F1980 Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile
Medical Device Packages and Westpak Accelerated Aging Time Calculator.42,43 Accelerated aging techniques are based on the assumption that the
chemical reaction involved in the deterioration of materials follow
the Arrhenius reaction rate function, which states that a 10 °C
increase in temperature will cause the reaction rate to double.

To examine long-term stability of reagents, 50 μL spiked serum
or plasma was added to freeze-dried reagents. After dissolution of
reagents in sample, strip was inserted into the well following above
protocol for wash and development.

Structural Model of Nanobody
The structural model was
predicted using the i-tasser Web server, http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/, for the sequence provided.44

Image
Analysis
Images of lateral flow strips were acquired
using an Apple iPhone 6 and analyzed with ImageJ software.45 ImageJ Gel Analyzer plug-in was used to plot
intensity profiles of LFIA strips and analyze test line intensities
(Supplementary Figure 11).
