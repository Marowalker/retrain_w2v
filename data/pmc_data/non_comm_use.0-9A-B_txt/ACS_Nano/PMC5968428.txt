Despite the rapid
development of complex functional supramolecular
systems, visualization of these architectures under native conditions
at high resolution has remained a challenging endeavor. Super-resolution
microscopy was recently proposed as an effective tool to unveil one-dimensional
nanoscale structures in aqueous media upon chemical functionalization
with suitable fluorescent probes. Building upon our previous work,
which enabled photoactivation localization microscopy in organic solvents,
herein, we present the imaging of one-dimensional supramolecular polymers
in their native environment by interface point accumulation for imaging
in nanoscale topography (iPAINT). The noncovalent staining, typical
of iPAINT, allows the investigation of supramolecular polymers’
structure in situ without any chemical modification.
The quasi-permanent adsorption of the dye to the polymer is exploited
to identify block-like arrangements within supramolecular fibers,
which were obtained upon mixing homopolymers that were prestained
with different colors. The staining of the blocks, maintained by the
lack of exchange of the dyes, permits the imaging of complex structures
for multiple days. This study showcases the potential of PAINT-like
strategies such as iPAINT to visualize multicomponent dynamic systems
in their native environment with an easy, synthesis-free approach
and high spatial resolution.

Complex supramolecular
systems
have fascinated chemists, biologists, physicists, and material scientists
for decades.1 In biological and synthetic
materials, control over the architecture of multicomponent systems
is pivotal for their performance, such as storing information,2−4 generating motion,5−8 performing catalytic reactions,9,10 and enhancing
optoelectronic properties.11−14 Recently, the emerging class of supramolecular polymers
established its role as versatile systems for a broad range of functionalities.15 Despite considerable progress, visualization
and in-depth understanding of the microstructure of such dynamic self-assembled
polymers remains a formidable challenge.16 Conventional tools, such as spectroscopy and light scattering, are
powerful yet insufficient to unambiguously determine supramolecular
organization in a direct manner without modeling. By contrast, microscopy
offers direct access to real-space information but often not at the
required spatial resolution nor without perturbation of the object
of interest. This latter impediment is particularly relevant for intrinsically
dynamic systems, such as supramolecular fibers where molecular components
are held together by noncovalent interactions. Recently, super-resolution
microscopy has been introduced as an effective tool to overcome these
obstacles.17−20 The widespread employment of single-molecule localization microscopy
(SMLM) to image in situ natural20−23 and synthetic24−29 supramolecular polymers is a testament to its great utility. Indeed,
it has opened the door to a better understanding of the exchange dynamics
and formation pathways of one-dimensional aggregates.28,30−35 Unfortunately, most SMLM strategies applied to supramolecular fibers
require chemical functionalization of the systems with dyes, which
involves time-consuming synthesis and can potentially influence the
supramolecular structure. Instead, PAINT (point accumulation for imaging
in nanoscale topography)36 microscopy circumvents
this requirement as it exploits (transient) aspecific18 or specific19,20 physisorption of fluorescent
dyes onto the surfaces of objects of interest.

Inspired by (DNA-)PAINT
and photoactivation localization microscopy
(PALM) approaches, we recently introduced a combinatorial extension
of these techniques coined iPAINT (interface point accumulation for
imaging in nanoscale topography) featuring higher control over dye
photoswitching and more general applicability.37 This method has since been used to visualize interfaces
of water–oil emulsions, air nanobubbles,37 and micelles,38 rendering it
a promising strategy for imaging of supramolecular polymers. iPAINT
utilizes caged rhodamine dyes as fluorophores (Scheme S1).39,40 It exploits the uncaging and
subsequent localization of a small subpopulation of photoactivatable
rhodamine dyes to improve spatial resolution. The uncaging of these
fluorophores involves the photolysis of the photoactivatable moiety
with low-power ultraviolet light, a Wolff rearrangement, followed
by a nucleophilic attack on the resulting ketene.39,40 This last step requires the presence of an auxiliary nucleophile,
which has thus far limited iPAINT’s utility to aqueous media.
However, recent works by the groups of Kaminski and Manners41 and Voets42 have
pointed out a potential solution. It was found that caged rhodamine
dyes may be used in organic solvents for PALM (photoactivated localization
microscopy) in the presence of a small percentage of alcohols that
acts as a source of nucleophiles for uncaging the dyes. To evaluate
the applicability of this advance in iPAINT, we explore herein its
employment in the investigation of dynamic supramolecular systems
in nonpolar organic media. Through a comprehensive series of control
experiments, we establish that the quasi-permanent labeling of the
fibers is critical to yielding remarkable fidelity in resolving supramolecular
microstructures. The versatility of this approach is finally demonstrated
in two-color iPAINT experiments that unveil nanometer thin, micrometer
long supramolecular block copolymers.

Results and Discussion
To optimize iPAINT for imaging supramolecular polymers in organic
solvents, we adapted the previously reported strategy37 in the following manner (Figure 1). First, we added 1% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol
(i-PrOH) to sample solutions to ensure the formation
of the fluorescent species. Second, we chose not to attach the dyes
to polyethylene glycol chains, as described in previous iPAINT protocols,37 to enhance solubility in organic media and to
minimize interference with supramolecular fiber formation. We first
performed single-color iPAINT experiments on several hydrogen-bond-based
supramolecular polymers in methylcyclohexane (MCH) with the aim to
establish a reliable imaging routine. In addition to the classical
chiral benzene tricarboxamide (S-4),43 we selected chiral (S-1) and achiral (A-1) tripyridylamine tricarboxamides;44 chiral (S-2) and achiral (A-2) triphenylamine tricarboxamides;
and chiral biphenyl tetracarboxamide (S-3) (Figure 2a). All chiral derivatives bear (S)-3,7-dimethyloctyl
chains, whereas the achiral analogues possess n-dodecyl
chains. Each monomer was allowed to self-assemble in MCH to form one-dimensional
supramolecular homopolymers (e.g., poly(S-1) is the supramolecular homopolymer of monomer S-1) via slow cooling from
100 to 20 °C at either 15 or 60 °C h–1. For imaging purposes, approximately 0.5–1% (v/v) caged dye
(Cage-552 or Cage-635, 10 mM in DMSO) (Scheme S1) and 1% (v/v) i-PrOH were added. As a result,
the dyes “stain” the fibers through noncovalent, nonspecific
interactions (Figure 1). Because a small amount of polar solvent, such as DMSO and i-PrOH, can denature H-bond-based networks of supramolecular
polymers,45−47 we performed spectroscopic control experiments that
confirmed the stability of the fibers under iPAINT conditions (Figure S1). For clarity, the dye used to visualize
each respective polymer is denoted by a superscript label (e.g., poly(S-1)C-635). Once immobilized on the microscope coverslip,
the stained fibers can be imaged by iPAINT. This is because the translational
motion and the monomer exchange30 are effectively
arrested upon physisorption onto the substrate, allowing for single-molecule
localization with high precision. iPAINT imaging reveals the formation
of micrometer long and 26–100 nm thick fibers for poly(S-1)C-635,
poly(S-2)C-552, and poly(A-2)C-552. Poly(S-3)C-552 and poly(S-4)C-552 samples were ∼26 nm thick (Figures 2 and S2–S4), whereas poly(A-1)C-552 exhibits bundles of multiple fibers (25 nm up to hundreds of nanometers
thick), likely driven by its scarce solubility in MCH (Figure 2d). These results illustrate
the potential of iPAINT imaging to visualize supramolecular fibers
in organic solvents—without any chemical modification of their
respective monomer units—and to discern between one-dimensional
polymers and bundled aggregates, with a spatial resolution down to
∼20 nm (Figure S2). Additionally,
to demonstrate the applicability of iPAINT imaging in both organic
and aqueous solvents, we visualized water-soluble 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide-based
supramolecular polymer poly(W-4)45 by iPAINT in water (Figure S5a). In agreement
with what we previously observed by STORM microscopy30 on poly(W-4) covalently labeled with Cy-5
dyes, we visualize micrometer long and nanometer thin fibers (Figure S5b,c), confirming the broad applicability
of iPAINT.

Self-assembly of supramolecular polymer via slow
cooling, subsequent noncovalent staining (dyes represented as green
flakes), and injection in the sample chamber. Once the fibers are
immobilized on the coverslip, iPAINT imaging can commence. Single-molecule
localization of the tagged fibers is carried out via photoactivation of the caged dyes with a UV laser (λ = 405
nm) and subsequent excitation with a suitable visible wavelength laser
(λ = 561 nm). Emitting dyes (represented as green flakes with
a green halo and red cross) are localized with high precision, and
their positions contribute to the pointillistic reconstructed image.
Once photobleached (black flakes), the dyes are no longer localized.

performed with monomers, c = 200 μM in MCH,
0.5% (for b,c) and 1% (for d–g). Caged dye, c = 10 mM in DMSO, 1% i-PrOH.

Although physisorption onto a surface is well-known to hamper
the
monomer exchange of supramolecular fibers in water,30 the dynamicity of these polymers dissolved in organic solvents
in the absence as well as in the presence of dyes remains unclear.
We hence sought to elucidate the effect of dye physisorption on the
dynamicity of the homopolymers in solution. To do so, we performed
two-color iPAINT experiments on fibers formed by mixing chemically
equivalent, but differently stained, supramolecular homopolymers as
poly(S-1)C-635 and poly(S-1)C-552 (Figure 3a).
Imaging reveals essentially equivalent poly(S-1) fibers in both red and green channels (Figure 3b,c). This indicates that the
resulting fibers are randomly stained with red and green dyes, labeled
as poly(S-1)C-635/C-552 (Figure 3d)
and implies a fast exchange between poly(S-1)C-635 and poly(S-1)C-552 in organic media.
Monomer exchange takes place within tens of seconds—that is,
the time between mixing the solutions and the adsorption of the fibers
on the coverslip, at which point monomer exchange is suppressed. We
repeated this experiment with poly(S-2) and observed the same effect (Figures 3f–i). We verified these observations
by quantifying the single-molecule localizations in both channels
for several fibers, which revealed a high number of localizations
in both channels (>70%) along the fibers (Figure 3e,j). Moreover, the same set of experiments
was performed after heating stained polymers (Figure S6) to 90 °C and then cooling them back to 20
°C, thereby disassembling and reassembling the fibers. In all
cases, fiber formation was observed, and dye–polymer correspondence
was lost, demonstrating that the dyes do not self-sort nor hamper
exchange among supramolecular polymer chains.

10 mM in DMSO, 1% i-PrOH.

We next demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of this
technique
by visualizing more advanced supramolecular fibers in two-color experiments.
We focused on imaging the supramolecular block copolymer poly[(S-1)-co-(S-2)], which can be formed by the addition of
poly(S-1) to poly(S-2) at 40 °C, as we recently discovered (unpublished
work). Before mixing the homopolymers for iPAINT imaging, we selectively
stained poly(S-1) with Cage-635 (red
dye), giving poly(S-1)C-635, and poly(S-2) with Cage-552
(green dye) to give poly(S-2)C-552, and then we added 1% v/v i-PrOH to each solution. The prestained homopolymers were thus mixed
in a 1:1 ratio at 40 °C (Figure 4a). iPAINT imaging revealed a distinct block-like
arrangement of red- and green-stained segments within the supramolecular
fibers (Figure 4b–d).
We observed a preference for the formation of di- and triblock copolymers
with a mean block length of roughly 3–4 μm, consistent
with the formation of poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552]. A similar
segregation has only been observed for supracolloidal polymeric chains48,49 and supramolecular amyloid fibers.50 To
quantify the segregation of blocks within single fibers, we counted
the number of red and green single-molecule localizations in each
block. In the red blocks, we have 8% green localizations, whereas
in the green blocks, we calculated 18% red localizations (Figure 4e). Given the overlap
of the absorption spectra of the two probes at the excitation wavelengths
used (Figure S7a) and the uncaging mechanism
(see Supporting Information for further
details), the occurrence of green localizations in the red segments
(and red localizations in the green segments) is likely a result of
crosstalk of the two-color experiments (Figure S7b) and not due to incorporation of, for example, (S-1)C-635 monomers
into poly(S-2)C-552. Under λ = 561 nm irradiation, Cage-552 will be primarily
excited, yet Cage-635 shows a non-negligible spectral overlap in the
absorption spectrum at that wavelength (∼20%, Figure S7a). Conversely, upon λ = 647 nm irradiation,
Cage-552 shows ∼3% spectral overlap in the absorption spectrum
(Figure S7a). To quantify the extent of
crosstalk at the single-molecule level, we prepared single-color stained
fibers and imaged them by iPAINT. We illuminated the sample with both
lasers at λ = 561 nm and λ = 647 nm. We calculated that
16% of “false positives” are registered as red localizations
on poly(S-2)C-552 (Figure S8a–c). Conversely,
32% of green localizations have been found on poly(S-1)C-635 (Figure S8d–f). The percentage of “false positives”
calculated at the single-molecule level is higher than when compared
to the spectral overlap values, which is due to a prolonged emission
of dye molecules in two consecutive frames during the alternate illumination
of the sample with two laser lines (see Supporting Information for further details). This results in the localization
of the same molecule twice, namely, as red in the first and green
in the second frame or vice versa. These extra localizations
contribute to an increase of “false positives” registered
in the same supramolecular block. For the copolymers displayed in Figure 4, we have less red
localizations in the green blocks (and green localizations in the
red blocks) than these “false positive” threshold values,
quantitatively confirming the presence of the block-like architectures.

μM in MCH, 0.5% caged dye c = 10 mM in DMSO,
1% i-PrOH.

The remarkable clarity achieved in visualizing these supramolecular
architectures was surprising given the dependence of iPAINT on reversible
staining and dye exchange. As previously reported,37 reversible physisorption of fluorescent probes ensures
prolonged acquisition times, which in turn leads to a high number
of precise localizations, enough to allow the full reconstruction
of the object. This is granted by the continuous exchange between
the physisorbed dyes and those freely dispersed in solution, permitting
a continuous supply of nonbleached dyes at the interface of interest.
Interestingly, this feature would have been detrimental for imaging
supramolecular block copolymers because the dye–polymer correspondence
imposed by prestaining would have been lost. Precisely because we
are able here to visualize the block-like architecture of poly[(S-1)-co-(S-2)], we suspected dye exchange to be suppressed in organic
solvents. This motivated us to investigate in more detail the behavior
of physisorbed dyes onto supramolecular fibers. To this end, we quantified
the number of localizations along the single-color stained fibers
in time (Figure 5)
and observed that both caged dyes exhibit an exponential decrease
in counts as a function of acquisition time. For fibers stained with
Cage-552, no localizations were found after ∼200 s (Figure 5a), whereas for the
ones stained with Cage-635, localizations are no longer registered
after ∼80 s (Figure 5b). We attribute this behavior to a lack of dye exchange between
supramolecular polymers and the reservoir in organic solvents. In
sharp contrast, a continuous replacement of the probes adsorbed onto
the fibers with those in solution is maintained in water, where a
constant number of localizations is observed throughout the iPAINT
experiment (Figure S9). As a consequence
of the photobleaching of the quasi-permanently physisorbed dyes, we
find an exponential decrease of the localizations in time (Figure 5c). We attribute
this behavior to the low solubility of the dye in MCH,42 which is consequently found to adsorb onto the
coverslip. Indeed, when we calculate the number of localizations on
the coverslip (i.e., where no fibers are absorbed),
we register a mean value of 500 loc/μm2. This value
is 5 times higher than what is reported for iPAINT in water,37 consistent with the lower solubility of the
dyes in alkanes and hence their depletion from the reservoir. We thus
posit that the observed dye–polymer correspondence is ultimately
a consequence of the unexpected noncontinuous labeling of the supramolecular
structure.

Figure 5 Single-molecule localizations as a function of time for (a) poly(S-2)C-552 and
(b) poly(S-1)C-635. The exponential decay observed within the imaging time demonstrates
the (c) lack of exchange of the physisorbed dyes with the ones in
solution and the overtime bleaching of the physisorbed dyes; (d) two-color
iPAINT images of poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-635] and single-molecule
count decay of single-molecule localizations detected in the red and
green channels for the (e) red and (f) green block as a function of
time. The error bars are the standard deviation calculated over several
fibers. The same trend in the two channels indicates the (g) lack
of migration of the dyes within the different stained blocks of the
copolymer as illustrated.

Additionally, the high visual fidelity of the block-like
segments
in the two-color experiment requires not only that the physisorbed
dyes do not exchange with reservoir dyes but also that the physisorbed
dyes do not migrate into neighboring domains—for example, Cage-635
remains primarily in the poly(S-1) segments
of poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552]. To evaluate this, we monitored
in time the number of single-molecule localizations in the red and
green blocks of selected fibers of poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552].
We observed that the decay rates of the red and green localizations
within the red block are similar (Figure 5e), and likewise, so they are for the green
block (Figure 5f).
This suggests there is little or no dye migration along the fiber
as this would reduce the correlation between the two signals (Figure 5g).

Once we
established that the dynamicity of the supramolecular polymers
is maintained upon staining (vide supra, Figure 3) and that the dyes
do not self-sort spontaneously (Figure S6a,b), nor exchange with the reservoir, nor migrate along the polymer
(Figure 5), we then
verified that the dyes have no preferential interaction with one of
the two supramolecular homopolymers. To this end, we disassembled
poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552] by heating the solution to 90 °C
and reassembled the copolymer by cooling it to 20 °C. The disassembly
brings the system to the molecularly dissolved state, which results
in the loss of the dye–polymer correspondence. Upon reassembly,
the dye molecules randomly adsorb onto the newly formed fibers, resulting
in fully green and red stained architectures. This thermal cycle demonstrates
the lack of a preferential interaction of the two probes with a specific
homopolymer (Figure S6g–i) and confirms
the veracity of the imaged block architectures.

Finally, we
probed the limits of dye–polymer correspondence
in a time-lapse iPAINT imaging series. Spectroscopic experiments revealed
that the addition of poly(S-1) to poly(S-2) at 20 °C results
in a metastable self-sorted state; the dynamicity of the codissolved
homopolymers is evidently low at this temperature. Copolymerization
is initiated by either heating the mixture to 27 °C or equilibrating
for long periods of time at 20 °C. Intrigued by the possibility
of visualizing the progression of self-sorted to blocky supramolecular
polymers, we performed iPAINT measurements over the course of 1 week
on poly(S-1)C-635 and poly(S-2)C-552 that were mixed at 20 °C. iPAINT
images acquired immediately after mixing confirm the presence of self-sorted
homopolymers (Figure 6a and Figure S10). After 1 h, iPAINT imaging
reveals that poly(S-1)C-635 and poly(S-2)C-552 interact to
form supramolecular block copolymers (Figure 6b). The block-like structures obtained are
due to a balance between the favorable hydrogen bonding interactions,
which support the heterointeractions, and the mismatch penalty that
suppresses the complete mixing of the two monomers. This architecture
is also observed after allowing the sample to equilibrate for 8 h
(Figure 6c) and 3 days
(Figure 6d). However,
after 1 week, we observed a complete intermixing of the dyes (Figure 6e).

time-lapses of the mix of poly(S-1)C-635 to
poly(S-2)C-552 at 20 °C. Directly after the mixing, (a) poly(S-1)C-635 and poly(S-2)C-552 are
in a self-sorted state. After 1 h, (b) the system evolves in block
copolymers poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552]; (c) 8 h and (d) 3 days after the
mixing, iPAINT can still accurately visualize the block architecture.
One week after the mixing, (f) iPAINT displays random organization
of Cage-635 and Cage-552 along the fiber. (f) Percentage of red counts
in green blocks, and vice versa, as a function of
time, after 1 week the percentage results are higher than the fluorescence
crosstalk of the dyes (dashed line for false green and dashed-dotted
line for false red positives). (g) Schematic representation of the
migration of the dyes originating the loss of dye–polymer correspondence
after 3 days. Imaging performed with 98.5% cS-1 = cS-2 = 200 μM
in MCH, 0.5% caged dye c = 10 mM in DMSO, 1% i-PrOH.

To validate the observed
stability of the blocks over time, we
evaluated the percentage of green localizations in the red blocks
(and red localizations in the green blocks) at each time point. Within
the first 3 days of measurements, the percentage of red counts in
the green blocks falls below the “false positive” threshold
of Cage-635 (Figure 6f). Likewise, the percentage of green localizations in the red blocks
falls below the crosstalk threshold of Cage-552 (Figure 6f). After 1 week, however,
the percentage of red localizations in the green blocks, and vice versa, exceeds the respective crosstalk thresholds,
indicating a mixing of the dyes physisorbed along the fibers. Because
poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552] exhibits stable spectroscopic features
for over 1 week in the same imaging conditions (Figure S11), we hypothesize that the mixing observed by iPAINT
after 1 week is due to a loss of dye–polymer correspondence.
Hence, iPAINT successfully reports on the microstructure of supramolecular
block copolymers as long as dye solubility is low and dye–polymer
correspondence is maintained.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report
on the visualization of one-dimensional
supramolecular polymers using iPAINT microscopy with a resolution
down to ∼20 nm. By adapting iPAINT microscopy to image structures
in apolar solvents, we introduce a facile, synthesis-free technique
that allows for imaging of dynamic supramolecular architectures. The
hindered exchange of dyes between the reservoir and the stained interface,
as well as the hampered migration of dyes along the fibers, grants
the dye–polymer correspondence imposed by prestaining the supramolecular
homopolymers. This ensures the investigation of the arrangement of
microstructure in poly(S-1)C-635 and poly(S-2)C-552 mixtures. We visually
confirmed the existence of poly[(S-1)C-635-co-(S-2)C-552]
as a block-like supramolecular architecture, which is consistent with
extensive spectroscopic characterization. A thorough analysis of “false
positive” localizations has been carried out to ascribe the
red/green block-like arrangements observed in iPAINT images to the
copolymer microstructures. Finally, time-lapse studies indicate that
this technique’s polymer–dye correspondence holds for
up to several days. The opportunity to perform multicolor iPAINT on
supramolecular systems unlocks exciting possibilities for characterizing
multicomponent supramolecular aggregates in their native environments
at nanometer resolution. This is achievable by simple noncovalent
staining without any further chemical modification. We anticipate
that iPAINT microscopy will become an invaluable tool for the characterization
of dynamic supramolecular systems.

Methods
Microscopy
iPAINT images are acquired using a Nikon
N-STORM system equipped with ∼160 mW/cm2 (λ
= 405 nm), ∼488 mW/cm2 (λ = 561 nm), and ∼1.3
W/cm2 (λ = 647 nm) laser lines configured for quasi-total internal reflection fluorescence imaging. The
angle at which the inclined excitation is performed is finely tuned
to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The fluorescence emission is
collected by means of an oil immersion objective (Nikon 100×,
1.49 NA). A quad-band-pass dichroic filter (97335 Nikon) is used to
separate the excitation light from the fluorescence emission. Time-lapse
images of 15 × 103 frames are recorded onto a 256
× 256 pixel region (pixel size 170 nm) of an EMCCD camera (ixon3,
Andor) at a rate of 47 frames/s. Two different photoactivatable dyes
are used to perform two-color iPAINT measurements: Cage-635 and Cage-552
(Abberior) (Scheme S1a,b, respectively).
Upon excitation with the proper wavelength (λ = 561 nm for Cage-552,
λ = 647 nm for Cage-635), the fluorescence of the dyes is collected.
The localization of single molecules in the iPAINT image is carried
out by NIS-element Nikon software.

(A-1), 4,4′,4″-nitilotris(N-dodecylbenzamide) (A-2), 4,4′,4″-nitrilotris(N-((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyl)benzamide) (S-2), N3,N3′,N5,N5′-tetrakis((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxamide
(S-4), N,N′,N″-tris((S)-3,7-dimethyloctyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide
(S-3), and N1-(1-amino-3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetracosan-24-yl)-N3,N5-bis(1-hydroxy-3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetracosan-24-yl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide
(W-4) were synthesized as previously reported51 and vacuum-oven-dried before use.

Spectroscopy
UV/vis and circular dichroism (CD) measurements
were performed on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter, for which the
sensitivity, time constants, and scan rates were chosen appropriately.
The temperature was set and monitored using a Peltier-type temperature
controller with a temperature range of 263–393 K and adjustable
temperature slope. For every CD measurement performed, the linear
dichroism was also measured, and in all cases, no linear dichroism
was observed. For spectroscopic measurements, spectroscopic grade
solvents were employed, and different cells were employed. For CD
and UV/vis measurements, a sealable quartz cuvette with an optic path
of 1 cm × 1 mm was used. Solutions were prepared by weighting
the necessary amount of compound for the given concentration and dissolved
with a weighted amount of solvent based on its density. The stock
solutions were heated, sonicated until completely dissolved, and slowly
cooled to room temperature every time before use unless otherwise
specified. The spectroscopic measurements were performed on solutions
prepared within the same day. The CD measurement performed after 1
month was carried out on the same sample stored in the dark in a sealable
cuvette at 20 °C.
