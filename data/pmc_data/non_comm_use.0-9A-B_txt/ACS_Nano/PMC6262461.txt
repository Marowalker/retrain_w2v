Small
oligomers of the protein α-synuclein (αS) are
highly cytotoxic species associated with Parkinson’s disease
(PD). In addition, αS can form co-aggregates with its mutational
variants and with other proteins such as amyloid-β (Aβ)
and tau, which are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. The processes
of self-oligomerization and co-oligomerization of αS are, however,
challenging to study quantitatively. Here, we have utilized single-molecule
techniques to measure the equilibrium populations of oligomers formed in vitro by mixtures of wild-type αS with its mutational
variants and with Aβ40, Aβ42, and a fragment of tau. Using
a statistical mechanical model, we find that co-oligomer formation
is generally more favorable than self-oligomer formation at equilibrium.
Furthermore, self-oligomers more potently disrupt lipid membranes
than do co-oligomers. However, this difference is sometimes outweighed
by the greater formation propensity of co-oligomers when multiple
proteins coexist. Our results suggest that co-oligomer formation may
be important in PD and related neurodegenerative diseases.

==== Body
The aggregation
of the protein
α-synuclein (αS) from its soluble monomeric form into
amyloid fibrils is associated with a range of devastating neurodegenerative
disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and a series of
related synucleinopathies.1 In these conditions,
amyloid fibrils of αS are segregated into cytoplasmic brain
inclusions, Lewy bodies, or Lewy neurites,2 although molecular complexes consisting of a small number of αS
monomers, termed oligomers, are increasingly recognized as the most-cytotoxic
forms, giving rise to the disease etiology.3−7 It has also been found that single-residue mutational
variants of the protein, including A30P, E46K, and A53T, are associated
with familial forms of PD.8−10 Moreover, aggregates of αS
are observed in more than half of the patients suffering from Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) along with the more-characteristic deposits of the amyloid-β
(Aβ) peptide and the protein tau.11 The co-occurrence of the aggregates of αS, Aβ, and tau
has been reported in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, and
it has been suggested that this enhancement could be due to co-interactions
between the proteins.12

αS
has been shown in vitro to assemble into
a large variety of oligomers with distinct morphologies, structures,
and functional properties. Such oligomers can be formed via different
mechanisms and include non-fibrillar off-pathway species and prefibrillar
intermediates of the amyloid fibril formation process.7,13−16 The mutational variants of αS have been found to affect the
rates of αS aggregation17−19 and oligomer formation20 and to alter its interactions with lipid membranes.21 The effects of the amino acid substitutions
on the rate of oligomer formation and the number of oligomers remain
unclear. Previous studies have reported either increased4,18,22 or unaltered20 levels of oligomers formed by the mutational variants relative
to wild-type αS. Additionally, the formation of co-oligomers
between different variants of αS has been observed to occur
in aqueous solution.23

In addition
to its ability to self-assemble into a variety of oligomeric
species, αS has been reported to interact with other proteins,
including Aβ and tau. For example, the effects of αS and
Aβ cointeraction on the aggregation of Aβ42 in
vitro have recently been delineated,24 and the direct binding between αS and Aβ40 and Aβ42
in solution has been characterized25−27 as well as the direct
interaction of αS and tau.28−30 The formation of co-oligomers
containing both αS and Aβ has been predicted by several
molecular dynamics simulations.31−33 Furthermore, the formation of
a dimer composed of αS and Aβ domains upon their coordination
to Cu2+ has been reported,34 and the formation of co-oligomers of αS and tau has been observed in vitro.(35) The accumulation
of co-oligomers of αS and tau in the human brain has been shown
using novel conformational-specific antibodies.36 In addition, the formation of co-oligomers of αS
with Aβ and tau in human red blood cells has recently been reported.37

Despite the accumulating evidence that
αS can form self-oligomers
as well as co-oligomers with other proteins, the extent of formation
and the properties of these co-oligomeric species remain to be determined
and quantified. Most in vitro investigations, particularly
at low physiologically relevant protein concentrations, have focused
on the self-oligomerization of αS because its co-oligomerization
is difficult to detect and quantify under these conditions. A comprehensive
characterization of the self-oligomerization process of αS and
its co-oligomerization with the mutational variants or Aβ and
with tau can help to compare their relative abundances, and functional
assays can reveal the relative cytotoxicities of the self- and co-oligomeric
species. To address these issues, we have combined the highly sensitive
single-molecule two-color coincidence detection (sm-TCCD) technique,38 which enables the selective detection of both
self- or co-oligomeric species, with statistical mechanical modeling.39 Using these methodologies, we have characterized
the self-oligomerization of wild-type αS; its co-oligomerization
with the mutational variants A30P, A53T, and E46K; and its co-oligomerization
with Aβ40 and Aβ42 and tau construct k18, which contains
four repeats of the aggregation-prone region of full-length tau,40 at physiologically relevant protein concentrations
in aqueous solution. We have derived the equilibrium free energies
of oligomer formation for the studied protein combinations, enabling
a quantitative comparison of the self- and co-oligomerization processes.
Furthermore, we have investigated the ability of the characterized
self- and co-oligomers to permeabilize lipid vesicles, allowing us
to quantify and compare their potential for lipid membrane disruption.

Results
and Discussion
TCCD Measurements of the Formation of Self-Oligomers
We first performed sm-TCCD measurements of self-oligomer formation
by wild-type αS (subsequently abbreviated as “WT”),
A30P, A53T, and E46K αS using singly labeled monomers bearing
Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) and Alexa Fluor 594 (AF594) fluorophores.
These fluorescent labels were incorporated at residue 90 of αS
molecules, which has been shown not to perturb its aggregation propensity
in our previous work.7 In the experiments,
samples containing a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of AF488 and AF594-labeled
monomers of the same protein were combined over a wide range of initial
total protein concentrations ranging from low-nanomolar concentrations
to 3 μM, corresponding to the reported range of the physiological
abundance of αS.41−43 Solutions were incubated under quiescent conditions
for 72 h at 37 °C in a buffer of physiological pH and ionic strength
(defined in the Methods section) to generate
equilibrium populations of oligomers. Such quiescent conditions have
been previously shown to generate αS oligomers but not fibrils.15,44,45 Note, however, that no oligomer
enrichment steps are employed in our preparation in contrast to previously
reported protocols.15 Indeed, the absence
of fibril formation under these incubation conditions was confirmed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (see the Supporting Information). Furthermore, it was verified that
incubation for 72 h is sufficient to generate equilibrium populations
of oligomers, even for the A30P isoform, which is characterized by
the slowest aggregation kinetics20,21 (Figure S2). In addition to αS, we also
analyzed the self-oligomerization of the Alexa Fluor (AF)-labeled
construct of tau protein k18, which comprises the central region of
this protein that is included in the microtubule binding region and
is frequently used to study tau aggregation.46,47 For the experiments with k18, the same concentrations and incubation
conditions were used as with αS isoforms to enable a direct
comparison of the oligomerization potential of both proteins.

During the incubation of protein solutions containing 1:1 ratios
of AF488- and AF594-labeled monomers of αS and of the tau construct,
the oligomers containing both fluorescent dyes were formed and were
quantified by sm-TCCD.38 For the sm-TCCD
measurement, the withdrawn protein solutions were immediately diluted
to pM concentrations to enable single-molecule analysis, and continuously
passed through a microfluidic device mounted on a single-molecule
fluorescence microscope to reduce the detection time, as previously
detailed.48 We previously verified that
oligomers remained stable during single-molecule measurements under
the same conditions.49 The solutions were
excited by overlapped and focused 488 and 594 nm laser beams, and
fluorescence bursts from AF488 and AF594 were simultaneously detected
in the two separate emission channels. Thus, AF488-labeled molecules
gave rise to discrete noncoincident fluorescence bursts in the AF488
channel, while AF594-labeled molecules lead to fluorescence bursts
in the AF594 channel. Any fluorescence bursts that were coincident
in both channels corresponded to the oligomers bearing both AF488
and AF594. These dual-labeled species were distinguished from the
excess of singly labeled species and quantified by the criterion of
temporal coincidence according to eq 1 (see the Methods section).
Note that this approach allows the selective monitoring and quantification
of only the dual-labeled oligomer species and not singly labeled species,
and we therefore refer to the resulting oligomer concentrations as
“apparent oligomer concentrations”. In addition, the
characterization of their exact physical sizes or structures is beyond
the scope of this technique. We confirmed the absence of any direct
interactions between the free AF dyes used in our experiments by doing
control experiments using free AF488 and AF594 in aqueous buffer,
as described in the Supporting Information and Figure S2. The resulting plots of
the apparent concentrations of self-oligomers of αS A30P, A53T,
E46K, and WT and of tau k18 are shown in Figure 1a–e. The data show that the oligomer
populations formed under these conditions are below 200 nM, highlighting
the challenge of studying these species by less sensitive bulk experimental
techniques. The oligomer populations of the αS variants A30P,
A53T, and E46K reached higher levels than the WT protein, with E46K
giving the highest apparent oligomer concentrations. The highest apparent
equilibrium concentrations of oligomers were observed at the highest
total starting αS concentrations, as expected by mass action,
in agreement with our previous study of oligomer formation by αS.49 The apparent concentrations of oligomers formed
by k18 were mostly below 10 nM, which is consistent with the expected
low aggregation propensity of this protein in aqueous buffer solution
in the absence of aggregation inducers.46,47 They were
nevertheless sufficiently above the background, confirming the formation
of a low population of oligomeric species under the incubation conditions
used here (Figure S2).

of self-oligomers plotted against the total
initial protein concentrations. A total of three to five separate
samples were analyzed for each initial concentration of monomeric
protein. The resulting values are represented by red crosses, and
the fit to a single-peptide oligomerization model is shown as a solid
line. The shaded bounds represent the fitting error derived using
nonparametric bootstrapping, as detailed in the Methods section.

TCCD Measurements of the
Formation of Co-Oligomers
We next set out to determine whether
or not αS WT could co-oligomerize
with its mutational variants, as well as with Aβ40, Aβ42,
and k18, by combining equimolar ratios of the WT with the other proteins.
The 1:1 mixtures of αS WT with its mutational variants are likely
to be physiologically relevant as the variants of αS are known
to coexist with αS WT in vivo.(8−10) The interactions of αS with Aβ40 and with Aβ42,
both of which are largely extracellular, is of interest in the light
of the reported role extracellular αS may play in neurodegeneration.50 The potential co-interaction of αS WT
with the tau construct k18 is of interest because both αS and
tau proteins are predominantly intracellular and, therefore, are likely
to coexist under the same conditions.

To quantify the extent
of co-oligomerization of the various protein combinations, we combined
and incubated 1:1 stoichiometric ratios of αS WT, singly labeled
with AF488, with each of these other proteins, singly labeled with
AF594, and selectively monitored the formation of co-oligomeric species
that contain both fluorophore labels by sm-TCCD following the same
protocols, as described above for the detection of self-oligomers.
The apparent oligomer concentrations measured in this way are shown
in Figure 2, indicating
that co-oligomeric species are formed with all of the protein combinations.
The apparent equilibrium concentrations of co-oligomers of αS
WT and A30P (Figure 2a) can be seen to be similar to the apparent concentrations of self-oligomers
of αS WT (Figure 1e). Interestingly, the apparent concentrations of αS WT co-oligomers
with A53T and E46K (Figure 2b,c) are similar to the apparent concentrations of oligomers
generated by the mutational variants alone (Figure 1b,c), and are higher than the apparent concentrations
of the self-oligomers of αS WT (Figure 1e). Our observation that αS WT can
readily co-oligomerize with all of the chosen mutational variants
differs from the conclusion of a relatively recent single-molecule
study that identified selectivity in the co-interactions with these
different mutants.23 The experimental conditions
in the two studies are, however, different and the incubations were
carried out over much longer time scales in the present experiments,
thus making the results not directly comparable. The observed populations
of co-oligomers between WT and k18 can be seen to be below 20 nM over
a similar monomer concentration range (Figure 2d). Despite the low levels of such species,
the direct detection of co-oligomerization of αS with tau is
interesting, especially considering that there are at least six major
isoforms of tau in the human brain.51 The
concentrations of co-oligomers between αS and Aβ detected
appear even lower but, in fact, can be predicted to be higher than
for all other co-oligomers when comparison is made over the same initial
monomer concentration range. This is also an interesting result, especially
given that multiple isoforms of Aβ can be present in
vivo.(52) Indeed, it is likely that
various isoforms of tau or of Aβ may also co-assemble because
the extent of co-aggregation between different proteins is known to
be determined by the identity of their primary sequences.53

Figure 2 Equilibrium populations of co-oligomers formed in 1:1
mixtures
of the various protein combinations as indicated in the panels. A
total of two to five separate samples were studied at each concentration.
Individual values are represented as purple crosses, and the fit to
a two-peptide model of oligomer formation is denoted by a solid line.
The shaded bounds represent the fitting error, as in Figure 1. Note that the apparent low
oligomer concentrations in panels e and f are due to the lower monomer
concentration ranges investigated (see the x axes).
In fact, these concentrations are predicted to be higher than for
other co-oligomers over the same monomer concentration range.

Theoretical Modeling of
Self- and Co-Oligomer Data Sets to Determine
the Free Energies of Oligomer formation
We then analyzed
the data sets observed for self- and co-oligomer formation by sm-TCCD
(Figures 1 and 2) using
a statistical mechanical model similar to a previously reported model.39 In this theoretical model, the key parameter
describing the oligomerization process is the Gibbs free energy of
monomer addition to an oligomer or another monomer, ΔG°, independent of oligomer size, as illustrated schematically
in Figure 3a. This
parameter characterizes the ease of oligomer formation by monomeric
species, and the more negative the value, the more favorable the oligomerization.

Figure 3 Modeling
of self- and co-oligomer formation. (a) Schematic representation
of the two processes. The fitted values of free energies of oligomerization,
ΔG° values, derived from the analysis
of sm-TCCD data for the formation (b) of self-oligomers and (c) of
co-oligomers. The standard errors in the ΔG° values were determined using a non-parametric bootstrap approach
as defined in the Methods section. The dotted
line denotes the ΔG° for the formation
of oligomers from WT.

In the present model, described in detail in the Methods section, the oligomers were treated as simple
non-interacting
one-dimensional chain structures with nearest-neighbor interactions
independent of chain length. The approximation of non-interacting
oligomers is reasonable given the very low apparent concentrations
of oligomers in the present experiments. For self-oligomers, our model
is identical to that previously reported.39 Note that the modeling explicitly takes into account the fact that
only oligomers containing both AF488 and AF594 dyes will be detected, whereas
the singly labeled oligomers are not detectable (see the Supporting Information). The modeling of linear
co-oligomers requires a substantial new theory to be developed, detailed
in the Supporting Information “Co-Oligomer
Modeling” section. Under the present conditions, most oligomers
are inferred to be dimeric (see the Supporting Information “Oligomer Sizes” section). Therefore,
although we cannot rule out the existence of larger nonlinear oligomeric
species (e.g., tetrahedral clusters) not explicitly
included in our linear oligomer model, they cannot in any case be
present at sufficiently high concentrations under the present experimental
conditions to significantly affect our analysis. We test this by considering
a trimer-only model and a tetramer-only model, finding them to give
successively worse fits to the experimental data on self-oligomers
(see the Supporting Information “Justifying
the Choice of Model” section). Note that dimers are naturally
accounted for as the smallest aggregate species in our linear model.
We emphasize that oligomers have been shown to have a different structure,
stability, and toxicity compared to fibrils;7,49 thus,
our ΔG° is not the same as for fibril
elongation.

Our model is not applicable to the analysis of the
data derived
for the samples containing Aβ at the highest concentrations
investigated because we expect fibrillar aggregates to exist at equilibrium
above the critical aggregation concentration for fibril formation,
which is the lowest total monomer concentration that is required for
the formation of fibrils.39 Using the same
fitting procedure, we previously estimated these critical aggregation
concentration values to be 222 ± 10 and 86 ± 10 nM for Aβ40
and Aβ42 isoforms, respectively.39 Larger fibrillar aggregates were indeed observed using TEM (Figure S1) in solutions containing either Aβ40
or Aβ42 at a 3 μM concentration. Because Aβ comprises
only half of the protein molecules in the αS–Aβ
solutions, we restricted our analysis of these data sets to total
protein concentrations that were up to twice those previously derived
critical aggregation concentration values.

Following the fitting
of self- and co-oligomer data sets, as detailed
in the Methods section, we derived the value
of ΔG° of oligomerization of all of the
protein combinations investigated in this study. The resulting values,
summarized in Figures 3b,c and listed in Table S1, are all large
and negative, similar in magnitude to the values previously reported
for the formation of Aβ40/42 oligomerizing systems.39 The least-negative ΔG° value of −19.4 ± 0.5 kJ mol–1 was obtained for k18, which is consistent with its lowest propensity
to self-assemble under our experimental conditions in the absence
of aggregation inducers. Interestingly, the resulting ΔG° value for αS WT of −24.0 ± 0.3
kJmol–1 is less negative than the resulting values
for all mutational variants of αS except WT-A30P. In addition,
the ΔG° values for WT-Aβ co-oligomers
(−29.4 ± 0.6 kJmol–1 for WT-Aβ40
and −30.8 ± 1.0 kJmol–1 for WT-Aβ42)
are more negative than the value for αS WT and less negative
than our previously obtained values for Aβ40 and Aβ42
self-oligomers (−36.3 kJmol–1 for both isoforms).39 Overall, the more-negative ΔG° values for the mixtures containing the WT protein compared
to αS WT alone suggest that the co-oligomer formation by αS
WT is more favorable than the self-oligomer formation for most of
the mixtures under our experimental conditions.

Predicted Equilibrium
Concentrations of Oligomer Populations
Based on the Derived Free Energies of Oligomer Formation
The derivation of the free energies of oligomer formation enables
the prediction of the total rather than apparent equilibrium concentrations
of self- and co-oligomers at any chosen protein concentration. Given
that oligomer concentrations depend exponentially on ΔG°s (as detailed in Supporting Information), even slight differences in the derived ΔG° values correspond to large differences in the resulting
equilibrium oligomer populations. Indeed, under the present conditions,
a stabilization of less than 2 kJ mol–1 is sufficient
to result in a doubling of the observed oligomer concentration. To
illustrate this statement, we set out to explore the relative concentrations
of different types of oligomers formed by the mixtures of αS
WT with its mutational variants. To this end, we predicted the overall
oligomer concentrations and the concentrations of the separate oligomer
subpopulations for the 1:1 mixtures of WT with its variant A30P, A53T,
and E46K generated over the total range of protein concentrations
from 10 to 1000 nM and compared them with the predicted oligomer populations
for αS WT at the same starting protein concentrations. These
predictions reveal that the co-oligomers of αS WT-A53T and WT-E46K
are the dominant sub-populations across the entire ranges of the protein
concentrations (Figure 4). In addition to the concentrations of the self- and co-oligomer
sub-populations in the αS WT–mutational variant mixtures,
we also predicted the concentrations of oligomers for αS WT
at a concentration of αS of 1.5×, which is relevant to
the scenario of αS overproduction54,55 and corresponds
to the conditions of its gene duplication.56 According to these simulations, the total oligomer concentration
in the αS WT–mutational variant mixtures can reach similar
levels to the 1.5WT system, and even-higher concentrations of oligomers
are generated in the case of WT-E46K combination.

Figure 4 Predicted equilibrium
concentrations of protein oligomer populations
over the concentration range of 10–1000 nM. In panels a–c,
the total concentrations of oligomers generated in 1:1 mixtures of
αS WT-mutational variant are shown (“total”),
and the separate oligomer subpopulations that are present in these
mixtures (co-oligomers are denoted as “mixed”, and the
self-oligomers of either component as “WT” and the corresponding
mutational variant). In addition, αS WT self-oligomers generated
at the same total protein concentrations are shown (“1.0WT”),
and the oligomers generated at 1.5 times higher total starting concentration
of αS WT (“1.5WT”). Note that in panel b, the
curves “1.5WT” and “total” overlap.

Importantly, this analysis shows
that the generation of high concentrations
of oligomers can be caused not only by the increased concentration
of soluble αS WT but also by the presence of the protein variants
that have a favorable interaction with the αS WT owing to sequence
similarity.53

The propensity identified
in this study of the mutational variants
of αS to generate elevated equilibrium concentrations of oligomers
and co-oligomers may explain their pathogenicity, along with other
previously established disease-relevant properties of these mutational
variants such as perturbed aggregation rates,17−19 altered binding
to lipid membranes,21,57 and the altered structural organization
of the oligomers.20

Subsequently,
we used the derived ΔG°s
to predict the populations of the defined oligomeric species at the
protein concentrations that correspond to their physiological abundance,
focusing on the mixture of αS WT and Aβ isoforms. Using
the protein concentrations that might be present inside a cell, 0.9
and 0.1 nM for Aβ40 and Aβ42, assuming their intracellular
concentrations are similar to their extracellular concentrations58 versus 300 nM for αS WT, based on the
measured Kd for membrane binding,59 the major oligomeric form is predicted to be
self-oligomers of αS WT (0.96 nM), followed by co-oligomers
of αS WT and Aβ (0.05 nM and 0.01 nM for WT-Aβ40
and WT-Aβ42), with Aβ self-oligomers being at concentrations
that are orders of magnitude lower. Thus, under these conditions,
most of the Aβ peptides within the oligomeric species are incorporated
into the co-oligomers with αS WT. At the protein concentrations
that correspond to their extracellular abundance in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), (0.9 and 0.1 nM for Aβ40 and Aβ42 versus
1 nM for αS WT),41,58 the predicted dominant type of
oligomer are self-oligomers of Aβ40 (83%) at a concentration
of 1.1 pM. Aβ42-containing oligomers are present at 0.04 pM:
70% of these latter oligomers are predicted to be co-oligomers of
αS WT and Aβ42, with 30% being self-oligomers of Aβ42.
Remarkably, most of Aβ42 is thus predicted to be a constituent
of co-oligomers under these conditions.

Co-Oligomer Formation Leading
to Increased Calcium Influx into
Lipid Vesicles Due to Membrane Disruption
Next, we set out
to examine if the self- and co-oligomers that αS forms with
its mutational variants and with the Aβ peptide are able to
permeabilize lipid membranes, a process that has been associated with
neurotoxicity.60 We addressed this question
by measuring the oligomer-induced permeabilization of lipid membranes
using a recently developed ultrasensitive single-vesicle assay that
quantifies Ca2+ influx into lipid vesicles upon membrane
disruption based on fluorescence-intensity changes of a calcium-sensitive
dye.61 Using this assay and identical experimental
conditions, we previously reported that neither monomeric Aβ
peptide nor monomeric αS WT cause significant calcium influx;61 therefore, any influx observed can be attributed
to the action of peptide aggregates on the vesicle membranes. The
detection of a higher fluorescence intensity corresponds to a larger
calcium influx due to a higher level of membrane permeabilization
caused by the aggregates.61 First, we examined
the action of αS WT with and without its mutational variant
E46K because this combination of αS proteins generated the highest
steady-state concentrations of mixed oligomers and was expected to
have comparable lipid-binding properties and not to form lipid-induced
aggregates under our experimental conditions. Separate solutions of
150 nM monomeric αS WT and of 150 nM monomeric αS E46K
variant were prepared and incubated under conditions for which we
have characterized the oligomer populations above (Figure 1e,c). We then quantified the
ability of these solutions to permeabilize membranes using the single-vesicle
assay,61 by measurement of the total Ca2+ influx (Figure 5a). Significant Ca2+ influx was observed in both
cases, confirming that the self-oligomers formed by these αS
variants can disrupt membranes (see the Methods section for further experimental details). We then used our theoretical
model to calculate the equilibrium concentration of oligomers formed
in each of these solutions (Table 1). Comparing these figures with the permeabilization
data allows us to quantitatively determine the ability of the respective
self-oligomers to induce Ca2+ influx [the permeabilization
propensity, measured in units of percentage point (ppt) Ca2+ influx per picomole].

values of Ca2+ influx, induced by the oligomers formed

We next prepared solutions containing both monomeric
αS WT
and the E46K variant at equimolar concentrations of 75 nM (total concentration
of 150 nM) and incubated them under the conditions described above
to allow the formation of oligomer populations. We then measured the
ability of the solutions containing these oligomer populations to
cause Ca2+ influx in the vesicle assay (Figure 5a). We again used our theoretical
model to determine the concentrations of WT self-oligomers (60 pM),
E46K self-oligomers (370 pM), and WT-E46K co-oligomers (740 pM) present
in these solutions (Figure 5b). Based on the concentrations of the self-oligomers and
their ability to induce Ca2+ influx that we have calculated
above, we can determine how much of the Ca2+ influx of
the mixture can be attributed to αS WT self-oligomers (3.7 ppt)
and αS E46K self-oligomers (5.6 ppt). The co-oligomers are therefore
responsible for 37.1 ppt of the Ca2+ influx. Dividing this
by the predicted co-oligomer concentration gives us the permeabilization
propensity of the WT-E46K co-oligomers.

These results show that
although E46K-containing oligomers are
formed much more readily than WT oligomers (Table 1), the ability of E46K self-oligomers to
cause Ca2+ influx is lower compared with the αS WT-containing
oligomers, indicated by their lower permeabilization propensity (Figure 5b). The co-oligomers
both readily form and significantly disrupt membranes and are thus
responsible for the great majority, namely 80%, of the observed Ca2+ influx caused by the mixed αS WT-E46K solution (Figure 5b).

Because
the toxicity of Aβ42 self-oligomers is also well-established,61,62 it is of interest to test the potential toxicity of αS WT-Aβ42
co-oligomers. Choosing monomeric concentrations at which co-oligomer
formation was predicted to be particularly high, we performed membrane
permeabilization experiments (Figure 5c) for solutions containing only self-oligomers (generated
from incubation of 4 nM Aβ42 or 40 nM αS WT, respectively)
and solutions containing self- and co-oligomers (generated from incubation
of 4 nM Aβ42 plus 40 nM αS WT). We employed our theoretical
model to calculate the concentrations of αS WT self-oligomers
(17 pM), Aβ42 self-oligomers (20 pM), and WT-Aβ42 co-oligomers
(49 pM) formed in the mixed solution. Combined with theoretical predictions
of the oligomer concentrations formed in the single-species solutions
(Table 2), the data
enabled us to perform the same analysis as above to determine the
relative ability of these different oligomeric species to permeabilize
membranes. Our results show that although more than half of the oligomers
formed in the mixed solution are co-oligomers, their contribution
to the ability of the solution to permeabilize membranes is small,
and therefore, co-oligomers are significantly less disruptive than
the self-oligomers (Figure 5d). Interestingly, we also find that Aβ oligomers are
over an order of magnitude more disruptive to membranes than αS
oligomers and that they are present at similar concentrations (Table 2). The greater number
of co-oligomers in this case is insufficient to outweigh the greater
membrane permeabilization propensity of Aβ42 self-oligomers,
which remain responsible for the majority (80%) of the Ca2+ influx caused by the oligomers present in the WT-Aβ42 mixed
solutions (Figure 5d).

Because the αS WT protein coexists with its
E46K variant
in the human brain of subjects displaying a single E46K mutation,
which means that the person carries one WT αS allele and one
allele with the E46K mutation, species formed during co-aggregation
may be involved in membrane permeabilization and the loss of protein
homeostasis. Our results show that the presence of E46K mutation leads
to the increased formation of E46K self- and co-oligomers and not
to these structures being inherently more damaging to lipid membranes.
Our results also indicate substantial co-oligomerization between the
PD-related αS protein and the AD-associated Aβ42 peptide.
However, although this hints at a possible cross-seeding effect that
may have relevance for amyloid fibril formation, the co-oligomers
themselves appear to be relatively inert in the single-vesicle assay
compared with the self-oligomers of Aβ42 and, thus, may have
comparatively little direct effect on cell-membrane disruption.

Taken together, our combined experimental and theoretical methodology
permits us not only to determine the concentrations of different types
of oligomers formed from mixtures of amyloidogenic monomeric peptides
and proteins at biologically relevant concentrations but also to gain
insight into their likely relative toxicities due to lipid membrane
disruption. In addition, the close agreement between the permeabilization
propensity values calculated for αS self-oligomers formed from
40 nM and 150 nM monomeric αS solutions (Figure 5b,d) clearly demonstrates the self-consistency
of our modeling approach. The number of possible cytotoxic αS-containing
co-oligomer types can, in principle, be very large in vivo, considering that new αS mutational variants are still being
discovered63,64 and numerous post-translationally
modified and truncated proteoforms of αS are physiologically
abundant,65 as well as multiple isoforms
of Aβ66 and other amyloidogenic proteins
and their complexes.67 More generally,
most proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases are found
to be post-translationally modified in the aggregated state so that
the formation of co-oligomers, either between different post-translationally
modified forms of the same protein or different proteins present in
the same cellular compartment, is likely to play a much more important
role in neurodegenerative diseases than previously thought.

Conclusions
In this study, we have performed a detailed quantitative analysis
of self- and co-oligomer formation by αS and its mutational
variants in vitro and investigated its co-oligomerization
with two major AD-related proteins, Aβ and tau k18 construct.
We have compared the potential for lipid membrane disruption by the
different oligomer types using a single-vesicle assay. Our results
show that at low physiologically relevant protein concentrations,
co-oligomer formation in most cases is more favorable than self-oligomer
formation by αS, and thus, αS-containing co-oligomers
may be highly abundant under conditions in which multiple proteins
coexist. We also find that although the co-oligomers examined are
less potent membrane disruptors in comparison to self-oligomers, their
adverse effects can become dominant when the co-oligomers are present
at high steady-state concentrations. The identified favorable formation
of co-oligomers between αS and other proteins and the high potential
of the resulting species to disrupt lipid membranes are important
in the context of synucleinopathies and in the development of therapeutics
against the onset and progression of these diseases.

Methods
Preparation of Self- and Co-Oligomer Samples
Monomeric
αS with an alanine to cysteine mutation, WT αS-A90C, A30P-A90C,
A53T-A90C, and E46K-A90C were expressed and purified based on the
protocol by Hoyer et al.68 and stored at
−80 °C with the addition of dithiothreitol. Fluorescent
labeling at residue 90 was carried out using Alexa Fluor (AF) 488
and 594 dyes (maleimide linkers, Invitrogen Lifesciences) according
to previously reported protocols7,20,49 by incubating the protein with 1.5 molar excess of the AF dyes overnight
at 4 °C in degassed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (10
mM phosphate, 0.27 mM KCl and 137 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) and subsequent
separation of the unreacted dyes on PD10 columns (GE Healthcare).
The labeling efficiency was checked by mass spectrometry and the samples
with labeling efficiency above 95% were selected (see the Supporting Information for representative spectra).
The expression and purification of k18 tau was performed as previously
reported,69 and labeling with the AF dyes
was carried out as for αS.7,20,49 Monomeric solutions of HiLyteFluor 488 (Anaspec, Fremont) were prepared
as described previously62,70 by dissolving the lyophilized
peptide in NaOH at pH 12, sonicating over ice for 15 min (Bandelin
Sonorex), and flash-freezing into aliquots and storing at −80
°C. For the incubations, 1:1 molar ratios of 488- and 594-labeled
protein monomers were combined in PBS buffer (composition defined
above) up to the final volume of 900 μL, and the protein combinations
are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Note that in the co-oligomerization experiments, a 1:1 molar
ratio of AF488-labeled protein variant is combined with a different
protein variant that is labeled with AF594, and thus, the species
that contain both AF488 and AF594 correspond to the co-assemblies
between the two protein variants and the self-oligomers of either
protein are not monitored. A total of three separate samples for each
concentration (in the range of 0–3 μM of total protein)
and protein combination were prepared. LoBind microcentrifuge test-tubes
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) were used for all incubations to prevent
surface absorption, as had been found to be effective in previous
studies.20,48,49,71 Incubations were performed for 3 days at 37 °C
without agitation. Upon withdrawal, the solutions were rapidly diluted
to 100 pM concentrations to enable single-molecule analysis and subsequently
analyzed using sm-TCCD.

TCCD Measurements and Data Analysis
TCCD measurements
were performed using a custom-built single-molecule fluorescence microscope
as previously described,49,69 utilizing fast-flow
microfluidics for sample detection48 and
closely following previously reported protocols.39 Dual-laser beam excitation was used by exciting the solutions
to be analyzed with collimated and overlapped 488 nm (Spectra Physics
NewPort Cyan) and 594 nm (Cobolt Lasers) laser beams operating at
2 and 1.3 mW powers (measured at the back port of the microscope),
reflected by a dichroic mirror (Semrock DiO1 R405/488/594), and sent
through an oil immersion objective (Plan Apo VC 60×, NA 1.40,
Nikon) to be focused 10 μm into the center of a microfluidic
channel. The two laser foci were visualized using a CCD camera and
overlapped by manually adjusting their shapes and positions in the xy plane. The laser beam overlap was routinely checked by
a stationary measurement using a dual-labeled (with 1:1 AF488 and
AF594) 40-bp TCCD DNA duplex at 25 pM concentration following previously
published procedures,48 and the alignment
was regularly carried out prior to protein measurements to ensure
maximum beam overlap. Fluorescence signal was collected by the same
objective, imaged onto a 100 μm pinhole (Thorlabs), and separated
into two channels by a dichroic mirror (Horiba 585DRLP). The pinhole
was conjugate with the plane of focus of the microscope objective
and the point of the laser excitation and, thus, eliminated out-of-focus
fluorescence and scattered light and reduced the background noise.
Donor fluorescence was filtered by a long-pass (Edge Basic 514) and
a band-pass filter (535AF45 Omega Filters) before being focused onto
an avalanche photodiode, APD (PerkinElmer). Acceptor fluorescence
was directed through a long-pass filter (610ALP Horiba) and a band-pass
filter (BrightLine 629/53) before being focused onto a second APD.
Synchronous output from the APDs was collected by custom-implemented
field-programmable gate array, FPGA (Celoxica RC10). Data were acquired
for 600 s (60 frames, 100 000 bins per frame, 100 μs
bin-width) per aliquot and consisted of time-binned photon bursts
in the donor and the acceptor channel. All measurements were made
at ambient temperature around 20 °C.

The collected photon
traces were analyzed using custom-written Igor Pro 6.22 (Wavemetrics)
software analogous to that previously described.48 The data were corrected for autofluorescence and for cross-talk.
Photon bursts with intensities greater than the threshold of 15 photons
per bin in the blue and, in the red channels, were selected according
to previously established threshold selection approaches that allowed
maximization of the detection of coincident events. Simultaneous events
in both channels above the threshold (the AND criterion)72 were selected. To account for any possible coincident
events due to chance, the desynchronization approach was used.73 Time-bins in the blue channel were randomly
renumbered before the selection of simultaneous events in the two
channels above the threshold. Using these outputs, the association
quotient Q was estimated according to eq 1: 1  where A is the number of
fluorescent bursts in the blue channel, B is the
number of fluorescent bursts in the red channel, C is the number of coincident events, and E is the
number of chance-coincident events (all above the 15 photons per bin
threshold). The apparent oligomer concentrations, presented in Figures 1 and 2, were defined as the
fraction of coincident events (oligomers) multiplied by the starting
total protein concentration.

Modeling of Self- and Co-Oligomer Data Sets
Having
ascertained that the experiments detailed here have reached equilibrium
with respect to oligomer formation (Figure S2), we analyzed our results using two equilibrium statistical mechanical
models: a previously described single-peptide oligomerization model39 and a new two-peptide model of co-oligomer formation.
The first model considers a solution of a single species of monomeric
peptide that can reversibly self-associate to form linear chains of
any length. The second model consists of a solution containing two
species of monomeric peptide that can reversibly associate to form
both mixed- and single-species chains. The equilibrium constants of
these reactions can be related to the free energies of monomer addition
to like and unlike peptides or to self- and co-oligomerization. We
work in the grand canonical ensemble, and we set the chemical potentials
by insisting on conservation of peptide. Furthermore, we consider
concentrations not numbers; thus, the only free thermodynamic parameter
is the temperature. Thus, the systems described by both models are
completely specified by the standard free energies, the peptide concentrations,
and the temperature. We can therefore determine the standard free
energies by least-squares fitting the apparent oligomer concentrations
as a function of initial monomer concentrations.

We first fit
the self-oligomer data to the single-species model to obtain the self-oligomerization
standard free energies. Note that the model contains a correction
factor (calculated exactly analytically) to account for the fact that
only the oligomers containing both AF488 and AF594 dye are detected
by the experimental measurements, with AF488-only and AF594r-only
oligomers being invisible. We then enter these free energies into
the two-species model, which we fit to the two-species oligomerization
data to determine the co-oligomerization standard free energy. These
data only measure the co-oligomer concentration, so we fit only to
the mixed oligomer component of the model.

Due to the complicated
analytical fitting procedure, a formal parametric
approach to error estimation is not suitable. Therefore, we prefer
to use a nonparametric bootstrap approach.74 Our data are effectively stratified by initial monomer concentration;
therefore, we also stratify our sampling to better reproduce the structure
of the data in our resamples.75 Furthermore,
we prefer a subsampling technique rather than full bootstrap because
subsampling is valid under much-weaker conditions than full resampling.76 Our full method is then to randomly sample one
data point at each monomer concentration and fit the resulting subdata
set to our model, recording the resultant ΔG°. This process is then repeated many times (we chose to do
500 repeats), generating a distribution of ΔG°. An estimate of the standard error for ΔG° is then given by the standard deviation of this distribution.

Quantification of Ca2+ Influx into Lipid Vesicles
Protein samples were prepared and incubated under the same incubation
conditions as for the sm-TCCD assays using unlabeled αS WT,
unlabeled E46K, and unlabeled Aβ42 at the total starting protein
concentrations as specified in Figure 5. For the detailed description of the preparation of
Aβ42 peptide stock and for details on the single-vesicle method,
see Flagmeier et al.61 Briefly, lipid vesicles
were composed of 16:0–18:1 PC and 18:1–12:0 biotin PC
at a 100:1 ratio and filled with 100 μM Cal-520 in HEPES buffer
of pH 6.5. This type of lipids was chosen after testing several different
lipid compositions, as detailed before,61 because it enabled the preparation of a fluid bilayer at room temperature.
Even though other lipid compositions can have this property, we avoided
using negatively charged lipids due to reported increased binding
of E46K mutational variant in comparison to WT αS in their presence.77,78 Multiple freeze-and-thaw cycles and extrusion using a membrane of
200 nm cutoff were performed. Then, size-exclusion chromatography
was carried out to separate non-incorporated dye molecules from the
vesicles. Subsequently, the purified vesicles were immobilized onto
PLL–PEG coated glass coverslips using a biotin–neutravidin–biotin
linkage and incubated in 50 μL Ca2+ containing Leibovitz’s
L-15 solution and were imaged using total internal reflection fluorescence
microscopy. Thereafter, 50 μL of protein solution was added,
and the same area of the coverslips was imaged to check if the solution
induced any influx of Ca2+ into the vesicles. Next, ionomycin,
an ionophore for cations, was added and incubated for 5 min. Ionomycin
allows Ca2+ to enter the vesicles and saturates them with
Ca2+. Subsequently, images of Ca2+ saturated
single vesicles of the same area were acquired. For each field of
view, 50 images were taken with an exposure time of 50 ms. The recorded
images were used to determine the fluorescence intensity of each spot
under the three different conditions: in the presence of only buffer
namely blank (Fblank), in the presence
of an aggregation mixture (Fsample), and
after the addition of ionomycin (FIonomycin). The detection of individual spots was implemented using “find
maxima”, and the intensity of the spots was calculated by considering
a 5 pixel diameter. Finally, the sample-induced relative Ca2+ influx into a vesicle was quantified using the following equation: 2  

The average degree and standard deviation
of Ca2+ influx was calculated by averaging the Ca2+ influx into individual vesicle from nine fields of view. P values reported in Figure 5 are obtained using a Kruskal–Wallis test with
α = 0.05. Data from just premixed versus incubated protein samples
are compared.
