We present a numerical/theoretical
approach to efficiently evaluate
the phase diagram of self-assembling DNA nanostars. Combining input
information based on a realistic coarse-grained DNA potential with
the Wertheim association theory, we derive a parameter-free thermodynamic
description of these systems. We apply this method to investigate
the phase behavior of single components and mixtures of DNA nanostars
with different numbers of sticky arms, elucidating the role of the
system functionality and of salt concentration. Specifically, we evaluate
the propensity to demix, the gas–liquid phase boundaries and
the location of the critical points. The predicted critical parameters
compare very well with existing experimental results for the available
compositions. The approach developed here is very general, easily
extensible to other all-DNA systems, and provides guidance for future
experiments.

==== Body
The pivotal
role played by DNA
in biology cannot be understated.1 Its
outstanding pairing specificity, embodied by the famous Watson–Crick
mechanism, lies at the core of its biological functionality. Exploiting
such a specificity in synthetic applications, an idea which dates
back to the seminal work of Seeman in the 1980s, provides researchers
from many different fields, ranging from nanotechnology to material
science, with a powerful tool.2,3 Since then, DNA has
been used in nanotechnogy to build, just to name a few examples, nanomachines,4 logic gates,5 and
nanoscale objects of predetermined shape thanks to DNA origami6,7 or DNA Lego-like bricks.8,9 On the materials side,
recent advances have made it possible to synthesize DNA-coated colloids
that self-assemble into both ordered and disordered structures10−13 as well as to produce materials made exclusively of DNA.14−17 These all-DNA materials are synthesized through a multistep self-assembly
process: the basic constituents are short strands with sizes ranging
from a few to a few tens of nucleotides and with sequences specifically
designed to self-assemble into well-defined constructs at intermediate
temperature. These DNA constructs can, in turn, bind to each other
to form higher order structures at lower T. The strategy
outlined here has been exploited to synthesize two-dimensional ordered
lattices14 as well as DNA hydrogels with
unique characteristics.15,17,18

Owing to the high degree of control provided by DNA, these
building
blocks can be used not only to synthesize biocompatible materials
with tunable properties but also to investigate fundamental questions.
For instance, trivalent and tetravalent DNA constructs (nanostars)
have been recently used to assess the dependence of the gas–liquid
phase separation on the maximum number of bonds that each particle
can form (also called valence). In fact, the experimental work of
Biffi et al.(17) confirmed
that, as predicted by theory and simulation,19 the gas–liquid phase coexistence region can be shrunk by
decreasing the maximum number of bonds that each particle can form.
The importance of this result is 2-fold. First, the experimental verification
of the effect of the valence on the gas–liquid instability
provides an innovative route for the generation of low-density physical
gels, also known as empty liquids.17 Second,
it strengthens the idea that carefully designed DNA constructs can
be used as experimental realizations of patchy particles, which have
recently gained much interest for their ability to self-assemble materials
with exotic thermodynamic and dynamic properties, such as low-density
gels, re-entrant gels, open crystals, ultrastable liquids, and much
more.20−24 Remarkably, many of the features that make these materials so unique
and interesting can be theoretically predicted by means of the Wertheim
thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT).25,26

Here, we introduce a method to predict the phase behavior
of a
system composed by interacting DNA nanostars (NST) with valence f = 2–4, identical to the ones employed in recent
experimental studies17,18 (see Figure 1a–c). Each DNA nanostar is formed
by f DNA strands made of 49 nucleotides, which hybridize
to form the body of the construct. The sequence of each strand terminates
with six self-complementary bases that allow for internanostar bonding
(see the Supporting Information). Therefore,
each DNA nanostar carries a functionality (or valence) f. When the strands composing the NST are mixed in solution in the
proper stochiometric ratio, they self-assemble into well-defined NST
constructs, interacting among themselves via the
sticky ends, as schematically shown in Figure 1d.

nanostars with different
functionalities. (a) A DNA dimer (f = 2), (b) a DNA
trimer (f = 3), and (c) a DNA tetramer (f = 4). The f strands composing each nanostar are
colored differently. (d) Simulation snapshot of a binary mixture composed
of 50 trimers and 100 dimers at a nanostar number density ρ
= 2.4 × 10–4 nm–3 and T = 48 °C. Trimers are colored violet, dimers are green,
and sticky ends are red.

To describe the temperature and density dependence of the
system
we exploit the Wertheim theory, a theory originally designed to model
associating liquids but which was proved to qualitatively (and, in
some cases, quantitatively) reproduce the numerical results obtained
in systems of patchy particles.21,27 The Wertheim theory
evaluates the free energy of the system as a sum of two contributions:
a reference part, which is often the free energy of a purely repulsive
system, and a bonding part, which takes into account the formation
of interparticle bonds. In the case of patchy colloids, the former
is provided by the Carnahan–Starling expression for the free-energy
of hard spheres,28 while the parameters
that determine the latter are embedded in the definition of the interparticle
interaction, which is set a priori. Extending the
Wertheim approach to all-DNA systems requires one to provide a way
of evaluating these two contributions.

We propose (i) to evaluate
the reference free energy building on
an existing accurate coarse-grained model for DNA, oxDNA2,29 which allows us to evaluate numerically the
effective potential between pairs of constructs and the associated
virial coefficient, in the absence of sticky interaction between the
NST. This requires short, small-scale simulations. The reference free
energy is then evaluated as a virial expansion truncated to the second
order. We also propose (ii) to evaluate the probability of association
between the sticky ends via the well-known SantaLucia
nearest neighbor model.30,31 We independently test
(i) and (ii) by running large-scale bulk simulations, which confirm
the validity of the approach. The theoretical expressions and the
numerical techniques are detailed in the Methods.

Finally, we test the resulting theory by evaluating the critical
points and coexistence regions of pure tetramer and trimer systems,
carrying out comparisons with the experimental and numerical data
available in the literature. We find good agreement with experimental
results for the critical temperature and for the density of the coexisting
phases away from the critical point, while comparisons with the experimental
critical densities are less favorable, as it is often the case with
patchy models.19 We also show that the
salt concentration plays a major role in determining the phase behavior
of these DNA constructs, which helps rationalizing recent experimental
results on their dynamical properties.32 We demonstrate the generality of our theoretical approach by computing
the critical points, coexistence regions, the degree of demixing as
well as the cloud/shadow curves of binary mixtures of DNA nanostars
with different valences, for several values of the salt concentration.

Results
and Discussion
Effective Interactions and Second Virial
Coefficients
The evaluation of the effective interaction
potentials βV(r) between DNA
NST in the absence of
binding sites and, consequently, of the second virial coefficients B2 (as detailed in the Methods) is key to our investigation methodology, which is based on a separation
of the free energy into a reference part, accounting for the repulsion,
plus a binding contribution computed using the SantaLucia model (see
the Methods). We start the discussion of the
results by reporting the reference interaction potentials and the
second virial coefficients, computed for tetramers. Similar results
for trimers are reported in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 shows
examples of the effective interaction potential and of the second
virial coefficients for DNA tetramers. Both βV(r) and B2 have a negligible T dependence, which reflects the weak T-dependence of the Debye screening length as well as the small absolute-T range relevant for DNA. By contrast, the salt concentration
has a substantial effect on the effective interaction. Indeed, the
screening length depends on the inverse of the square root of S, which varies by more than a factor of 10 in the explored
range. The resulting V(r) is well-described
for distances comparable to the construct size by an exponential decay
characterizing the softness and interpenetrability of the NST. The
decay length of βV(r) increases
on decreasing S, consistent with the increasing of
the screening length. The behavior of B2 is consistent with a bare excluded volume contribution of 1.7 ×
103 nm3 and displays a linear growth controlled
by S–1. Even though we have not
carried out a direct comparison, these results are in qualitative
agreement with the experimentally measured salt dependence of the
second virial coefficient of small DNA fragments.33,34

temperatures (inset). (b) Second virial coefficient B2 for DNA tetramers (f = 4) as a function

according to eq 11.

Comparison with Large-Scale
Simulations: Test of βV(r)
To validate the numerical
procedure designed to evaluate the repulsive part of the effective
potential and B2, we resort to a comparison
between a bulk simulation of DNA–NST interacting with oxDNA
(156800 nucleotides) and a simulation of particles interacting via βV(r). Indeed,
the accurate investigation of the structure and thermodynamics of
disordered all-DNA materials is a recent topic, and a large corpus of experimental results that can be used as terms
for comparison is not yet available. In particular, no scattering
data for inter-NST correlations are presently available to compare
with the theoretical predictions. Remarkably, oxDNA2 has been shown
to quantitatively reproduce the form factor of tetravalent nanostars,
as measured by small-angle neutron scattering experiments.35

Figure 3a shows the structure factor of a system of 800 DNA
tetramers at T = 50 °C, S =
0.1 M, and NST number density ρ = 1.8 × 10–4 nm–3 interacting with either oxDNA2 or βV(r). The structure factors of the two
systems are indistinguishable within our numerical accuracy, validating
the use of the effective potential, at least up to the large density
investigated (which is higher than the range of densities we will
consider in the following).

DNA tetramers simulated

in Figure 2 (lines),

0.1 M, and nanostar number density ρ = 1.8 × 10–4 nm–3. (b) Probability of forming a bond, pb, as a function of temperature for a binary
mixture composed by 50 DNA trimers and 100 DNA dimers at nanostar
number density ρ = 2.4 × 10–4 nm–3 and S = 1.0 M as a function of T. The line is the theoretical estimate, eq 6; circles are simulation data.

Comparison with Large-Scale
Simulations: Test of the Bonding T-Dependence
The second assumption on which we
build to develop a thermodynamic description of the association process
assumes that the bonding free energy depends on S, T, and the sequence of the sticky ends but not
the remaining parts of the nanostars. Testing such an assumption requires
a full-scale simulation to also take into account internanostar bonding.
We thus run simulations of a binary mixture made of 50 DNA trimers
and 100 DNA dimers (17150 nucleotides) at NST number density ρ
= 2.4 × 10–4 nm–3, S = 1.0 M and for several T, down to T = 36 °C. Below this temperature, 2 weeks of GPU computing
time are not sufficient to observe the convergence of observables
such as the potential energy or the total number of bonds. Such a
lack of equilibration highlights the demanding nature of these large-scale
simulations, and as a consequence, the usefulness of the proposed
theoretical approach. From the simulated configurations we evaluate
the probability to form a bond, pb, and
compare it to the theoretical estimate based on the well-known SantaLucia
model (see the Methods (eq 6) and SI). Figure 3b shows such a comparison,
confirming the validity of the theoretical expression.

Pure Systems
The theoretical and numerical expressions
reported in the Methods, complemented with
the oxDNA-based B2, provide a close expression
for the free energy of any mixture or pure solution of DNA NST of
arbitrary valence. We begin by evaluating the phase diagram for pure
solutions of trivalent and tetravalent NST, for which experimental
data for S = 0.035 M and S = 0.025
M are available.

Figure 4a shows the gas–liquid critical temperatures as a function
of the salt concentration for DNA tetramers and trimers. The same
figure also reports the available experimental data from ref (17). The theoretical estimates,
based on calculations that do not require a significant amount of
numerical resources, are in very good agreement with the experimental
data, being less than 2% off.

Figure 4 Gas–liquid (a) critical temperatures
and (b) critical densities
as functions of the salt concentration for DNA tetramers (circles)
and trimers (squares). Red and green symbols and lines refer to the
theoretical estimates (see the Methods). Blue
circles and squares are experimental values for tetramers and trimers,
respectively, from ref (17); the gray circle is a numerical estimate from ref (36).

Figure 4b
shows
the gas–liquid critical densities as a function of the salt
concentration for DNA tetramers and trimers. The critical density
increases monotonically with salt concentration, similar to the critical
temperature. Such behavior suggests that the coexistence region of
the system, in the (ρ – T) plane, broadens
with salt concentration, following the progressive softening of the
particles (see Figure 2b and Figure S3) as suggested in ref (36).

Figure 5 shows the
theoretical and experimental17 coexistence
curves for pure systems of tetramers and trimers in the ρ – T plane. We observe that the extent of the coexistence region
is comparable with the experimental data. For trimers, the shape of
the region is particularly well reproduced; for tetramers, the theory
underestimates the location of the binodal at high densities. Nevertheless,
a good estimate for the highest coexistence density, as well as for
the coexistence curve at small ρ, is found.

tetramers at S = 0.025
M (red line and symbols) and trimers at S = 0.035
M (green line and symbols). Lines refer to theoretical data, symbols
refer to experimental data, taken from ref (17). Empty symbols are the experimental critical
points.

As a general remark, we note that
the salt concentration has a
strong influence on the location of the critical points. Its effect
on the thermodynamics of the system is a result of two contributions.
First, S controls the flexibility and overall shape
of the NST (see the Supporting Information),35,37 as well as the repulsion between the DNA
nanostars and, hence, the value of the second virial coefficient.
Second, S enters in the bonding free energy, as prescribed
by the SantaLucia model (see eq 7 in the Methods). We find that the
critical T depends on S through
both B2 and the bonding free-energy, whereas
the S-dependence of the critical density is exclusively
encoded in B2 (see the Supporting Information).

In the past, the numerical
determination of critical points in
DNA NST systems has been attempted only through expensive numerical
simulations,36 with a substantial computational
effort. We show here, through direct comparison of our results with
data available in the literature, that the present far less demanding
methodology is able to yield equally good estimates but for all possible
values of the ionic strength.

Binary Mixtures
As predicted by theory and simulations19,38 and later
confirmed by experiments,17 the gas–liquid
phase coexisting region shrinks as the overall
valence of the system tends to 2. Approaching this limit with continuity
requires a noninteger average valence which can be achieved by employing
mixtures of fixed-valence objects. We thus study mixtures of constructs
with valence 4–2 and 3–2. We also investigate 4–3
mixtures, where both limiting cases (pure trimers and pure tetramers)
exhibit a gas–liquid phase separation. For all these systems,
we compute the loci of the critical points. We also compute some representative
coexistence curves as well as shadow and cloud curves for the 4–2
mixture. In all cases considered here, the nature of the phase separation
is found to be compatible with a gas–liquid phase separation
close to the critical point and becomes more demixing-like as T decreases.

Figure 6a shows the critical parameters for mixtures of trimers
and dimers at different salt concentrations. We observe that the trend
of the curve is similar for all the values of salt considered. In
particular, the critical density increases with temperature until
a maximum is reached and then converges smoothly toward the critical
point of the pure system. The maximum is less pronounced for smaller
salt concentrations. Interestingly, the curves at different S seem to collapse below a certain T, even
though such a collapse is not reached for the smallest values of S considered here.

Figure 6 Theoretical critical densities at different
temperatures for mixtures
of (a) trimers and dimers, (b) tetramers and dimers, and (c) trimers
and tetramers at different salt concentrations. Open symbols refer
to the binary mixtures; full symbols refer to the critical points
of the pure systems. In (c), the trimer critical point is always at
lower density with respect to the tetramer critical point.

The critical points of mixtures of tetramers and
dimers at different
salt concentrations, reported in Figure 6b, exhibit the same trends seen for the trimer–dimer
mixture. However, the nonmonotonic behavior of the critical density
is much more pronounced here. In addition, compared to the 3–2
case, the collapse of the curves starts at higher salt concentrations.

Figure 6c shows
the critical densities at different temperatures for mixtures of tetramers
and trimers at different S. This case is qualitatively
different from the previous ones in that both critical points of the
pure system exist. Indeed, it can be seen that the line of critical
densities at intermediate compositions connects the critical points
of the associated pure systems. Since the critical points of the pure
systems are separated by small T and ρ differences,
the lines of critical points of the mixtures are quite short in this
representation. We note that, in contrast with the previous cases,
we do not observe a collapse of the curves at low temperatures. We
also note that similarly to pure systems, the salt concentration plays
a big role in determining the critical parameters of the mixtures,
monotonically moving the critical points to higher T and ρ.

Next, we focus on the full coexistence region
of the mixtures.
The three mixtures have the same qualitative behavior, and thus, we
discuss only the 4–2 mixture. Since a state point in a binary
mixture of species A and B is identified by three thermodynamic quantities,
the phase diagram of binary mixtures requires a three-dimensional
representation. The most common thermodynamic variables used to represent
such phase diagrams are T and the density of each
species, ρA and ρB, or T, the total density ρ, and the composition x = ρA/ρ. In both these representations, the
region of phase coexistence is a volume in the three-dimensional phase
diagram. Therefore, for the sake of clarity, it is common procedure
to plot two-dimensional slices of the phase diagram by setting one
of the three thermodynamic variables to some constant value.

We start by taking cuts of the T, ρ, and x = ρ4/ρ phase diagram at constant
temperature. In Figure 7a, we report the coexistence curves, i.e., the binodals,
of the 4–2 mixture at salt concentration S = 0.05 M and different temperatures. At high T,
that is, close to the critical point of the pure system, the average
valence is large, and hence, all of the coexisting points have high x. However, as T decreases below the critical
temperature of the pure system, the density of dimers increases in
both the gas and the liquid phases, whereas the density of tetramers
grows in the liquid phase while remains small in the gas phase. In Figure 7b, we report two
examples of tie lines, which connect coexisting points of the two
phases, for the 4–2 mixture at salt concentration S = 0.05 M and different temperatures, one rather low (T = 5 °C) and one close to the Tc of the pure system, (T = 23 °C). The tie lines
confirm the picture sketched above. As discussed in ref (39), we see that the low-temperature
tie lines connect points with increasingly different compositions,
signaling a change in the nature of the phase separation, which acquires
a more significant demixing character as T decreases
while maintaining the liquid–gas character witnessed by a marked
density gap.

and
dimers at salt concentration S = 0.05 M and different
temperatures. (b) Theoretical tie lines for a mixture of tetramers
and dimers at salt concentration S = 0.05 M and different
temperatures T = 5 °C (black circles) and T = 23 °C (blue triangles). Open symbols refer to the
coexistence points, full symbols refer to critical points, and dashed
or full lines refer to tie lines.

We also assess the effect of salt concentration on the phase
coexisting
region. Figure 8a shows
the binodal curves at fixed temperature T = 10 °C
and different salt concentrations. As discussed in the context of
the critical parameters, the main effect of the salt is to enlarge
the two-phase region, which retains its shape but moves to more extreme
ρ as S increases.

curves for a mixture of tetramers and
dimers at fixed temperature T = 10 °C and different
salt concentrations. (b) Theoretical cloud (full lines) and shadow
(dashed lines) curves for a mixture of tetramers and dimers at x = 0.7 at different salt concentrations. Full symbols refer
to critical points.

Another common two-dimensional
representation of the phase diagram
can be constructed by fixing the overall concentration x and then plotting the resulting binodal, which is called the cloud
curve and contains all of the coexisting points having the chosen
composition as a function of T and ρ. Each
point on the cloud curve coexists with another phase which has, in
general, a different composition. The set of points coexisting with
the cloud points is called the shadow curve, and it is often plotted
together with the cloud curve, even though all its points have different
compositions, not only with respect to the cloud points but also with
respect to each other.

In Figure 8b, we
report the cloud and shadow curves for a mixture of tetramers and
dimers at fixed composition x = ρ4/ρ = 0.7 and different salt concentrations. First, we note
that the critical points always lie at the intersection of the two
curves, as expected.40 The effect of the
salt, similar to what happens for the locus of the critical point,
is to move the curves to substantially higher temperatures and densities.

Conclusions
The
advances in the synthesis of DNA-based materials call for the
development of numerical and theoretical methods for the evaluation
of their macroscopic properties. Here, we developed a theoretical
approach for the quantitative prediction of the low-density phase
diagram of one-component and binary systems composed of DNA constructs
with fixed valence. We have shown that these complex systems can be
modeled as collections of supramolecular particles that, depending
on temperature, can bond to each other but also experience an effective
mutual repulsion, which is controlled mainly by the salt concentration.
These two contributions can be readily evaluated via short two-body simulations employing a realistic DNA model29 and by means of the well-established nearest-neighbor
SantaLucia model,30,31 respectively. By comparing these
estimates with numerical results obtained through large-scale GPU
simulations, we have confirmed that the assumptions underlying these
two contributions hold very well, even at high density. The free energy
of the system can then be computed in a parameter-free fashion in
the framework of Wertheim TPT. In turn, the free energy can be used
to evaluate the phase behavior. We have shown that this procedure
yields results that are in semiquantitative (for the critical temperature
and the off-critical coexisting densities) and qualitative (for the
critical density) agreement with experimental results for one-component
systems. We have also extended this method to binary mixtures, providing
predictions for critical parameters and coexisting curves. Our results
shed light on the dependence of the phase behavior on temperature
and salt concentration, providing guidance for future experimental
work. We stress that the hybrid numerical/theoretical approach developed
here is very general: since it takes into account DNA–DNA interactions
in a realistic fashion, it can be extended to investigate the behavior
of all-DNA systems that incorporates complex DNA nanotechnology motifs
such as strand displacements (e.g., DNA re-entrant
gels,18 DNA vitrimers.41)

Methods
Theoretical Framework
In order to to estimate the gas–liquid
critical parameters and the coexistence regions of DNA nanostar systems,
we combine Wertheim TPT with an accurate mass-action law describing
DNA binding. The Helmholtz free energy per particle for binary mixtures
of DNA nanostars of different valence fA and fB using Wertheim TPT as in ref (39) is 1  where v = 1/ρ,
β
= 1/kBT, kB is the Boltzmann constant, βfref(T, x, v) is the free-energy per particle of the reference state, i.e., the state in which bonding sites are not present,
and βfb(T, x, v) is the free energy per particle associated
with the bond formation between the sticky ends. βfref(T, x, v) is evaluated by considering a system in which the sticky end sequences
are scrambled in such a way that Watson–Crick pairing does
not occur and no interstar bond can form; the residual interaction
is thus purely repulsive. In the binary mixture case, we express the
free energy in terms of the concentration of one of the two species
A and B, x = NA/N, N = NA + NB, and the reduced volume per particle v ≡ 1/ρ, ρ being the total number density.
The reference free energy is given by the two contributions 2  where the
ideal gas free-energy density is
given by βfid(T, x, v) = ln(v0/v) – 1 + x ln(x) + (1 – x) ln(1 – x), where v0 is a reference
volume whose value has no effect on the derivatives of the free energy.

We approximate the excess free energy per particle via a second virial coefficient approximation for binary mixtures42 3  where B2AA, B2BB, and B2AB are the second virial coefficients of the
pure systems of species
A and B and of the mixed system, respectively. These quantities are
computed at different salt concentrations and temperatures, using
the formula 4  where Vij(r) is the effective intramolecular pair potential,
computed through dedicated numerical simulations (see Numerical Methods). Note that Vij(r) is an average over the mutual
orientations of the nanostars and thus depends solely on the distance r between the centers of mass of the two objects considered.

Finally, as all bonds are identical, the bonding free energy per
particle is given by19 5  where ⟨f⟩ = fAx + fB(1 – x), fA and fB are the valences of the first
and second species, respectively, and pb is the fraction of formed bonds. The latter, which is function of T, x, and v, can be evaluated via a law of mass action, yielding 6  where Δ is linked
to the free-energy
difference between bonded and nonbonded pairs of sticky ends. Following
refs (30) and (31) 7  where ΔH = −42790
cal is the enthalpy gain upon bonding, ΔSnosalt = −119.84 cal/K, and ΔSsalt = 0.368·(Ldna – 1)·ln(S) cal/K are the salt-independent and salt-dependent entropy
variations again upon bonding, respectively. These quantities refer
to the sticky end sequences, for which Ldna = 6. The expression for Δ thus encodes the salt, temperature,
and sequence-length dependence of the free-energy difference between
bonded and nonbonded states. Furthermore, vb = 1.6606 nm3 is the reference volume of the nonbonded
single strands.9 Indeed, in a two-state
system the condition for chemical equilibrium is given by 8  where ρd is the density of
the products (double strands), ρs is the density
of the reagents (single strands), ρ̅ = ρ/ρref, where ρref = 6.022 × 1023 dm–3 = 0.6022 nm–3 is the standard
state density, and ΔG is the free-energy difference
associated with the bonding reaction. Δ, introduced in eq 6, is defined as 9  as in eq 7, which implies vb = 1/ρref = 1.6606 nm3.

For pure
systems, i.e., systems composed of particles
of the same species and same valence, eq 2 simplifies to 10  where B2(T) is, again,
the second virial coefficient of the particular
species considered, while eqs 5 and 6 hold, with x = 1 and fA = 4 (tetramers) or fA = 3 (trimers). For pure systems, the locus
of critical points is given by (Tc, ρc) at fixed salt concentration; for binary mixtures, it is
given by (xc, ρc) at
fixed temperature and salt concentration. Critical points always satisfy
the standard thermodynamical stability conditions.43

We also evaluate the coexistence region of both pure
systems and
binary mixtures. We do so by employing a standard common tangent construction.39 Different points that yield phases with the
same pressure and chemical potentials for both species lie on a tie line. We complete the analysis of the phase diagram
of the binary mixtures by looking at the cloud and shadow curves.
The locus of the cloud points in the x – T plane is obtained by considering the intersection of a
line at fixed x with the phase boundary in the ρA – ρB plane at fixed T. Each point on a cloud curve has a corresponding shadow point, which
is the state on the coexistence curve connected to the cloud point
through a tie line.40,44 We note that, as a consequence
of this construction, shadow points on the same shadow curve have,
in general, different compositions, whereas cloud points have, by
construction, always the same composition.

As a general remark,
we note that, in addition to the conditions
for phase coexistence one should also require Donnan equilibrium; i.e., the chemical potential of the salt in the two phase
should be the same, μsalt1 = μsalt2. However, since the absolute values of the
concentration of the coexisting phases are small fractions of the
overlap density, one can safely ignore it, assuming that the salt
has the same concentration in both coexisting phases.

Numerical Methods
We perform simulations of DNA nanostars
with oxDNA2, a DNA model coarse-grained at the level of single nucleotides.
The interaction forms and parameters in oxDNA2 are chosen to reproduce
structural and thermodynamical properties of both single- and double-stranded
DNA molecules in B-form. The interactions between nucleotides, modeled
as rigid bodies, account for excluded volume, electrostatic repulsion
between the negatively charged backbones, backbone connectivity, Watson–Crick
hydrogen bonding, stacking, cross-stacking, and coaxial stacking.
The interaction parameters have been adjusted in order to be consistent
with experimental data on the structure and thermodynamics of DNA.29,45 The electrostatic repulsion is provided by a Yukawa term characterized
by a screening length which is an increasing function of T and a decreasing function of S. We note that we
also present results for S = 0.025 M, a salt concentration
which is slightly below the lowest value for which oxDNA2 has been
parametrized.

In order to calculate the second virial coefficient,
we evaluate the interstar interaction potential V(r) in the infinite dilution limit. We compute V(r) between two isolated nanostars, for
different values of S and T, using
a generalized Widom insertion method.46 We first separately simulate the two nanostars for long enough that
they lose memory of their previous conformation. We then take the
two equilibrated configurations, fix the first one and randomly rotate
and insert the other so that their relative center-to-center distance
is r, with 0 < r < 30 nm.
We perform 500 insertions for every different value of r considered. For each insertion, we calculate the Boltzmann factor
of the insertion, e–βΔU, where ΔU is the potential
energy difference between the initial state (where the two nanostars
are very far apart) and the new configuration, and average it over
all trial insertions at fixed r. We repeat the whole
procedure for at least  iterations, obtaining the radial distribution
function, g2(r) = ⟨e–βΔU⟩r, from which the interaction potential between
the DNA nanostars in the limit of infinite dilution is readily obtained
as 11  

Given the small scale of the simulations,
which involve only two
DNA constructs, and the purely repulsive nature of the interactions,
convergence is reached very rapidly. Indeed, the evaluation of a single B2(T, S) value
takes from few minutes to few hours (depending on the size of the
nanostars and on salt concentration) on a single CPU core. The code
we use is based on oxDNA,47 and it is available
upon request.

We also run large-scale simulations (800 purely
repulsive tetramers
and a binary mixture of 50 trimers and 100 dimers) to test the assumptions
underlying the proposed theoretical approach. We perform these simulations
on NVIDIA K80 GPUs,48 and equilibration
takes between a few days to a few weeks of computer time.
