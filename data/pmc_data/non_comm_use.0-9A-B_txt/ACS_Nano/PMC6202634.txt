For
high-speed optoelectronic applications relying on fast relaxation
or energy-transfer mechanisms, understanding of carrier relaxation
and recombination dynamics is critical. Here, we compare the differences
in photoexcited carrier dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-three-dimensional
(quasi-3D) colloidal methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanoplatelets via differential transmission spectroscopy. We find that
the cooling of excited electron–hole pairs by phonon emission
progresses much faster and is intensity-independent in the 2D case.
This is due to the low dielectric surrounding of the thin perovskite
layers, for which the Fröhlich interaction is screened less
efficiently leading to higher and less density-dependent carrier-phonon
scattering rates. In addition, rapid dissipation of heat into the
surrounding occurs due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. Furthermore,
we observe a subpicosecond dissociation of resonantly excited 1s excitons
in the quasi-3D case, an effect which is suppressed in the 2D nanoplatelets
due to their large exciton binding energies. The results highlight
the importance of the surrounding environment of the inorganic nanoplatelets
on their relaxation dynamics. Moreover, this 2D material with relaxation
times in the subpicosecond regime shows great potential for realizing
devices such as photodetectors or all-optical switches operating at
THz frequencies.

Lead halide
perovskite thin
films have established themselves as an excellent material system
for photovoltaic applications due to favorable absorption and charge
transport properties.1−4 With bandgaps tunable throughout the visible range via halide ion replacement5,6 and quantum yields approaching
unity, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit strong potential for
a variety of other optoelectronic applications.7−10 While in both of these fields
either bulk or only weakly confined perovskite materials have been
employed, recently strongly confined perovskite NCs, such as two-dimensional
(2D) nanoplatelets (NPls), with a monolayer-precise control of the
thickness and resulting quantum size effects have emerged.11−15 With extremely high exciton binding energies and transition energies
tunable through quantum confinement, they demonstrate intriguing possibilities
for light-emitting applications such as LEDs or lasers.16−18 Moreover, with excitons dominant at room-temperature perovskite
NPls are also promising for excitonic device concepts. Importantly,
high-frequency limitations depend on the time scales for relaxation
and recombination scenarios of photoexcited or electrically injected
charge carriers.

In this paper, we investigate charge carrier
relaxation in 2D and
quasi-three-dimensional (quasi-3D) methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI)
NPls by means of femtosecond differential transmission spectroscopy
(DTS) at room temperature. Linear absorption spectroscopy initially
reveals the effect of quantum confinement on the continuum absorption
onset position and on the exciton binding energy, which is found to
be more than 10 times larger for the 2D NPls as compared to the quasi-3D
NPls. Consistently, results of transient DTS measurements show a bimolecular
recombination due to free electron–hole pairs for the quasi-3D
NPls and a monomolecular decay behavior characteristic for excitonic
decay for the 2D NPls. Regarding the initial carrier relaxation, we
find an intensity-independent subpicosecond cooling time in the 2D
NPls which is seven times faster than the strongly intensity-dependent
cooling time in the quasi-3D NPls. This can be explained by the large
surface-to-volume ratio of the 2D NPls hindering the creation of hot
phonons and a less efficient screening of the photoexcited carriers,
leading to high exciton-optical phonon scattering rates, governed
by the Fröhlich interaction.19,20 Finally, by
comparing resonant and nonresonant pump pulse excitation of the 1s
exciton transitions, we directly monitor the exciton dissociation
for the quasi-3D case, whereas resonantly excited excitons in the
2D NPls stay on the 1s exciton parabola. Our findings highlight the
vast differences occurring in perovskite materials based on their
dimensionality. Knowledge of these processes could prove critical
to designing optoelectronic devices relying on fast relaxation as
well as charge- or energy-transfer mechanisms.

Effects and Exciton Binding Energies
MAPI
NPls were synthesized by ligand-assisted exfoliation, as previously
developed by our group and as detailed in the Methods section.12 Their thickness is quantized
according to an integer number of 2D layers of corner-sharing [PbI6]−4 octahedra down to a single monolayer
(0.66 nm). Resulting NPl dispersions can be used to study the effect
of quantum confinement in one dimension, as the thick bulk-like NPls
are progressively shrunk down to the limit of 2D NPls. To show the
difference between 2D and 3D NPls, we selected a dispersion of trilayer
MAPI NPls (thickness d ≈ 2 nm) and thicker
NPls (d ≥ 15 nm), which are referred to as
quasi-3D NPls, due to their bulk-like optical properties (see also
Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2). The thickness of the MAPI trilayer is in the range of the 3D excitonic
Bohr radius of 2.5 nm and thus can be considered as quantum confined
in one dimension, whereas the bulk-like NPls are unconfined or only
weakly confined, hence justifying the distinction as 2D and quasi-3D
NPls, respectively.21

All measurements
presented here were conducted at room temperature on dispersions of
colloidal NPls in toluene. In Figure 1a, linear absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra
are shown for the 2D and the quasi-3D NPls. The absorption spectrum
in the 2D case reveals a 1s exciton resonance at 2.0 eV easily
distinguishable from the onset of the electron–hole continuum
transitions at 2.27 eV. For the quasi-3D case, the excitonic transitions
spectrally overlap with the continuum absorption onset due to homogeneous
and inhomogeneous broadening effects.22 Applying the Elliott model to the linear absorption spectra of the
NPls (cf. Figure S3) we
obtain band gaps of Eg3D = 1.66 eV and Eg2D = 2.27 eV as
well as exciton binding energies of Eb3D = 19 meV and Eb2D = 230 meV. These values correspond well to the range of previously
published values and confirm the bulk-like nature of the thicker platelets.23,24 For the 3D NPls, the exact determination of the binding energy is
difficult due the broadening of the absorption spectrum, and so the
obtained value constitutes an upper bound.25 Nevertheless, the exciton binding energy of the 2D NPLs is more
than 10 times as large as in the 3D case. This is caused by a change
in dimensionality (in the ideal case: Eb2D = 4·Eb3D) and by a reduced screening of the Coulomb interaction between electron
and hole due to the low dielectric constant of the organic ligands
and solvent surrounding the inorganic NPls.8 Similar values for the exciton binding energy were already observed
in the 1990s for layered PbI-based perovskite structures.26−28 The PL spectra of the NPls display single and narrow resonances
at EPL3D = 1.62 eV and EPL2D = 2.03 eV, respectively, exhibiting
Stokes shifts of <20 meV. This confirms the high quality and uniformity
of the NPls.11

transients assuming bimolecular decay kinetics (ΔT ∼ ne × nh) and monomolecular decay kinetics (ΔT ∼ n) for the 3D and 2D case, respectively.
On the right side, the corresponding recombination process is depicted
for the quasi-3D in the one-particle (c) and for the 2D case in the

These findings are represented schematically in Figure 1b, where the dispersion
relations E(K) for bound and unbound
electron–hole
pairs are depicted for the two perovskite NC systems. The huge blueshift
of approximately 600 meV of the energetic states due to quantum confinement
in z-direction, dispersion in only two directions
(x,y), and the large exciton binding
energy are the prominent characteristics of the 2D NPls. While for
the quasi-3D system, the exciton binding energy (19 meV) is smaller
than the thermal energy kT at room temperature (∼26
meV), the value for the 2D system is far above it. Importantly, for
2D NPls, it is not enough just to consider quantum confinement as
done for quantum dots, since apart from the confinement in z-direction, the dispersion in x- and y-directions is still retained; a fact which is necessary to understand
the time-resolved optical experiments presented in this paper.

Photoinduced
Carrier Dynamics
Time-resolved optical
studies on relaxation and recombination scenarios of photoexcited
electrons and holes in halide perovskite NPls have been restricted
to PL to date. As indicated by the photon line for the 2D case in Figure 1b, in such nonresonant
PL experiments, electron–hole pairs are typically excited far
above the continuum edge and then relax down to the 1s exciton parabola.
Radiative emission finally takes place from the crossing point of
the 1s exciton parabola E1s(Kx,y) with the photon
line close to K = 0. Due to a finite homogeneous
line width, the radiative emission stems from a respective “radiative
window” ΔE corresponding to an area
ΔK in Kx,y-space and to a coherence area in real space,
as theoretically introduced and experimentally demonstrated for the
case of GaAs quantum wells29 and recently
also shown for II–VI NPls.30

Consequently, time-resolved PL experiments can provide nearly no
information on the initial relaxation dynamics, which occurs before
the electron–hole pairs reach the radiative window on the 1s
exciton parabola. Instead, transient absorption experiments with femtosecond
pump and probe laser pulses have proven to be sensitive to the initial
ultrafast dynamics of photoexcited electron–hole pairs.31 The photoexcitation by the pump pulse initially
creates a coherent and highly nonthermal electron–hole distribution
at the E(K)-position, where the
photon line meets the continuum absorption for the given photon excitation
energy (Figure 2a).
This nonthermal distribution then thermalizes typically on a subpicosecond
time-scale through carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering.31,32 Thermalization means that thereafter the energetic distribution
of electrons and holes can be described with Fermi–Dirac distribution
functions fe,h(E,Tc). The distribution is generally referred to
as “hot”, as carrier temperatures Tc can initially be higher than 1000 K. Through phonon
emission, these carrier distributions cool down until the charge carriers
reach thermal equilibrium with the crystal lattice. With sufficient
excess energy of the charge carriers, the initial cooling occurs within
a few picoseconds due to Coulomb-mediated scattering with optical
phonons (Fröhlich interaction). The cooling process typically
slows down for higher excitation densities, as phonon reabsorption
increases with increasing phonon density (“hot phonon effect”),33,34 and the high density of photoexcited carriers leads to a screening
of the Fröhlich interaction.19,20,31,35 Once the carrier distribution
has cooled so far that optical phonons cannot be emitted anymore (kTc ≲ ELO),
the final cooling can only progress through less efficient acoustic
phonon scattering, typically caused by deformation potentials.20,36 All of these relaxation and cooling processes influence the onset
and (if slow enough) even the decay behavior of the 1s exciton PL.

obtained cooling curves. (e, f) Photon fluence-dependent measurements

Recombination
To investigate the
relaxation and recombination,
we have employed transient DTS on the 2D and 3D NPls, exciting far
above the continuum onset at 400 nm, focusing initially on the decay
of the ΔT signal for long time delays, τ
between the pump and probe pulses. As shown in Figure 1c,d, the observed ΔT(τ) transients for 2D and quasi-3D NPls behave differently.
For the quasi-3D NPls, the decay at the position of maximum bleaching
signal follows a 1/τ behavior,
indicating bimolecular decay kinetics, and with ΔT ∼ ne × nh likely stemming from free carrier recombination. The
decay becomes progressively faster as the excitation density is increased.
In contrast, the decay behavior of the ΔT(τ)
transients at the position of the largest bleaching signal is purely
exponential for 2D NPls indicating monomolecular decay kinetics, and
with ΔT ∼ n, likely
excitonic recombination (Figure 1d). Excitonic PL transients of halide perovskite mono-,
bi-, and trilayers also show such a monomolecular decay behavior as
recently discussed by our group.12 This
is a direct consequence of the significantly enhanced exciton binding
energy in the 2D NPls, which impedes a thermal dissociation of the
exciton at room temperature. In contrast, in the quasi-3D NPls, with
an exciton binding energy below the thermal energy at room temperature,
free electrons and holes are predominant. In both cases as the excitation
density is increased, the initial decay of the measured ΔT transients becomes slightly faster than described by the
calculated transients. Auger recombination and exciton–exciton
annihilation set in for the 3D and 2D NPls, respectively, as already
reported for bulk halide perovskite films.23

Relaxation and Cooling
In order to address the relaxation
and cooling dynamics of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, we
investigate the DTS signals at time delays between 300 fs and 30 ps.
Normalized ΔT spectra are shown in Figure 2b,c for the quasi-3D
and 2D cases with photon fluences of 350 μJ/cm2 and
700 μJ/cm2 per pump pulse, respectively. For all
measurements, we assured that the change in absorption upon pumping
(ΔA/A) remained below 10%
for the two systems in order to be able to compare them and ensure
that the systems are pumped weakly enough so that the transmission
is roughly proportional to the charge carrier density and to remain
far away from gain conditions. Apart from the main bleaching signal
at the two respective 1s exciton energies (1.62 and 2.04 eV), additional
transmission changes occur at higher photon energies. For the quasi-3D
NPls these extra ΔT contributions start right
on the high-energy side of the 1s exciton and exhibit an approximately
exponential decay to higher energies (Figure 2b). This is a clear indication that hot electron–hole
pair distributions bleach the continuum absorption by phase space
filling.37 For the 2D NPls, the corresponding
additional ΔT signal around 2.3 eV is well
separated from the 1s exciton signal, as can be seen clearly in the
inset in Figure 2c,
showing the ΔT spectra normalized to the values
at the continuum absorption onset. These results confirm our interpretation
of the absorption spectra within the Wannier–Mott exciton model
for the quasi-3D as well as the 2D NPls. For both cases, the distribution
functions obviously cool down with increasing time delays τ,
so we can use the ΔT spectra above the continuum
absorption onset for a given time delay to calculate the respective
carrier temperature Tc. We assume that
the Fermi–Dirac distribution function fFD(E,Tc) can be
approximated by a Boltzmann distribution function leading to38,39  

In this way, we obtain transient cooling
curves Tc(τ) for the quasi-3D and
the 2D NPls as depicted in Figure 2d–f. To ensure that the carriers have thermalized,
we only analyze cooling curves for time delays larger than 200 fs.32 Excited at the lowest photon fluences possible,
the two samples both show initial charge carrier temperatures well
above 1000 K as shown in Figure 2d. The charge carriers rapidly cool down in both systems
due to emission of optical phonons, which can be modeled by assuming
an exponential decay (see dashed lines in Figure 2d). For the quasi-3D system, we obtain a
time constant of 1.7 ps, while in the 2D system, carriers cool down
much more rapidly, namely with a time constant of 240 fs (see Table S1 for all cooling times). Importantly,
these times are significantly faster than the observed Auger recombination
(Figure 1c) and also
than Auger lifetimes reported on recently.40 Consequently, Auger recombination should not affect the
charge carrier cooling despite the high laser fluences and can be
neglected. This rapid cooling is not followed by a subsequent cooling
due to the emission of acoustic phonons, since the thermal energy
of the lattice at room temperature (kTL = 26 meV) exceeds the energy of optical phonons in MAPI (hvLO = 12–17 meV).41,42 That the cooling progresses faster in the 2D than in the quasi-3D
case seems counterintuitive initially. As the dimensionality is reduced
from 3D to 2D, the number of phonon modes and the density of states
(DOS) for electrons are reduced. Consequently, one would expect a
reduced carrier-phonon scattering rate and therefore longer cooling
times for the 2D system. Ultimately, the carrier confinement leads
to a so-called phonon-bottleneck and thus slow cooling when the system
is completely confined for quantum dots (0D).43−47 However, for the perovskite NPl system, another process
leads to enhanced carrier scattering. Instead of being embedded within
another semiconductor, the MAPI NPls with a large dielectric permittivity
are passivated by organic ligands and immersed in an organic solvent—here
toluene—with a small dielectric permittivity, as shown schematically
in Figure 3. Consequently,
Coulomb interactions with excited charge carriers in the quasi-3D
perovskite NPls are screened by the large values of the permittivity,
while those in the 2D perovskite NPls will be less screened due to
the penetration of electric field lines into the surrounding low dielectric
permittivity medium. This not only leads to the extremely large binding
energies of excitons but also has a pronounced effect on the scattering
of charge carriers among each other and with optical phonons, as governed
by the Fröhlich interaction.33 The
observed faster carrier cooling in 2D perovskite NPls is thus a direct
consequence of the reduced screening of the Coulomb-mediated carrier-LO-phonon
interaction in the low-dielectric surrounding. In turn, the more pronounced
screening results in a slower cooling process of carriers in quasi-3D
MAPI NPls.

Figure 3 Scheme of carrier cooling processes in thick (quasi-3D) and thin
(2D) NPls. After photoexcitation, the carriers cool down via emission of LO-phonons. As described in the main text, both screening
effects and larger surface-to-volume ratios explain why in the 2D
case, carrier cooling is faster and a dependence on carrier density
is not observed.

Interestingly, as shown
in Figure 2e,f, the
cooling times for the quasi-3D NPls increase
with increasing photon fluence of the pump laser, whereas they
remain constant for the 2D NPls. Two processes lead to this effect,
the first of which we identified as the hot photon effect and which has
already been observed for bulk perovskites.38,39,48,49 In this process,
the reabsorption of phonons by charge carriers, which depends strongly
on the phonon density, slows down the cooling process progressively
for increasing photon fluences. Second, a higher carrier density increases
the dielectric permittivity of the perovskite further, leading to
a stronger screening of the Fröhlich interaction and thereby
a reduced cooling rate.19,20,31,35 In the 2D system, exhibiting
a large surface-to-volume ratio, emitted optical phonons and subsequently
created acoustic phonons have a much larger probability to transfer
their energy into the colder medium surrounding the NPls. Thus, heat
can dissipate quickly, and the probability of hot phonon reabsorption
is substantially reduced.50,51 Furthermore, the increasing
photoexcited carrier density can only screen the Fröhlich interaction
within the thin 2D NPls, while the field lines of this interaction
in the surrounding remain unaffected. Thus, the scattering rates stay
consistently high even for high excitation densities.

Resonant versus Nonresonant Excitation
In the experiments
presented so far, optical excitation always occurred
far above the bandgap, thus creating hot charge carriers, which decay
subsequently through phonon emission as depicted in Figure 4a,b. To circumvent the entire
cooling process and investigate a (potential) change in the resulting
dynamics, we excite the 1s exciton at Ex = Ec – Eb directly (Figure 4d,e). To this end, we pumped the quasi-3D
and 2D NPl samples both resonantly with the 1s exciton peaks at 758
and 605 nm and nonresonantly at 565 and 400 nm, respectively. We then
analyze the ΔT transients for the wavelengths
of the probe pulse coinciding with the 1s exciton energy (Figure 4c,f). For nonresonant
excitation, we see that the ΔT transient of
the quasi-3D sample (Figure 4c, purple data points) shows a fast initial rise followed
by a slower increase to the full maximum after 1.8 ps. We ascribe
these two distinct dynamical time windows to the carrier thermalization
and the subsequent cooling dynamics of photoexcited carriers as discussed
above. Since the 1s exciton binding energy is small for the quasi-3D
NPls, carriers reaching the bottom of the continuum transitions are
already within the thermal window kTL of
the 1s exciton. In contrast, for nonresonant excitation of the 2D
NPls, the ΔT transient detected at the 1s exciton
(Figure 4c, orange
data points) shows a significantly slower increase and only one observable
time regime. In order to energetically reach the optically accessible Kx,y = 0 state
of the 1s exciton parabola, lying 230 meV below the onset of the continuum
transitions, a multitude of LO-phonons (approximately 15 LO-phonons)
must be emitted. Due to the small DOS of the excitonic states as compared
to the continuum states, this takes time and explains the slow rise
of the ΔT transient for 2D-NPLs. For the quasi-3D
NPls, the emission of only one LO-phonon is sufficient to overcome
this energy difference, and only a fraction of photoexcited electron–hole
pairs are expected to become converted into 1s excitons (E3Db < kBTL).41,42

energy) excitation of the quasi-3D (a) and 2D (b) NPls. Relaxation

phonons. (c) Corresponding ΔT transients for

The inset in (f) shows the heating of resonantly excited “cold”
1s excitons at longer times.

Under resonant excitation (Figure 4d,e), the ΔT transients
of both
samples (Figure 4f)
increase similarly fast with a time constant of approximately 200
fs, close to the time resolution of our experiment. For the quasi-3D
NPls, the fast onset is followed by a similarly fast decay, which
reduces the ΔT-transient down to a value of
70% of the maximum signal in only 170 fs. As explained previously,
photoexcited charge carriers initially exhibit δ-function-like
nonthermal distributions. As the energy difference between the 1s
and continuum is less than the thermal energy and comparable to that
of the optical phonons in perovskite, the resonantly created “cold”
excitons can be scattered by thermally available phonons into continuum
states where the DOS is high. Scattered away from the light line,
they no longer bleach the absorption, leading to the rapid drop in
the ΔT/T signal. This dissociation
of excitons has also been observed in four-wave mixing spectroscopy,
which we used previously to deduce the homogeneous line width of perovskite
NCs from the dephasing time T2 of the
1s exciton transition.24 The subsequent
decay, which is significantly slower and constant for all observed
times, is due to the recombination of excitons. In contrast, it seems
as though the 2D NPls do not exhibit such a behavior. However, if
we look at longer times up to 80 ps, as depicted in the inset
in Figure 4f and in Figure S4, the decay of the ΔT transient strongly resembles that of the quasi-3D sample, albeit
on a much longer time scale. In fact, the signal decays to approximately
77% of the maximum signal within 10 ps. In principle, the process
is the same, as resonantly excited Kx,y = 0 excitons scatter with phonons
(also LO) into Kx,y > 0 states on the 1s parabola as depicted in Figure 4e. However, with a binding
energy larger than 200 meV, excitons cannot be scattered into the
continuum, and thus thermalization can only take place with states
located on the 1s exciton parabola. As the DOS here is much lower
than in the continuum states, the phonon-induced heating of resonantly
excited “cold” excitons occurs significantly slower
in the 2D than in the quasi 3D case. Exciton recombination from the
radiative window then progresses as discussed above.

Conclusions
In summary, we have compared the relaxation and recombination dynamics
of photoexcited electron–hole pairs in 2D and 3D MAPI NPls
by means of transient DTS. Focusing on the cooling of excited electron–hole
pairs, we find striking and initially unexpected differences. For
the 2D case, relaxation is significantly faster than for their
3D counterparts and is independent of the excitation fluence.
We attribute this to a reduced screening of the Fröhlich interaction
in the 2D system and its low dielectric surrounding resulting in enhanced
and density-independent phonon emission as well as rapid dissipation
of the energy from the phonon system to the surrounding medium. Additionally,
we observe a rapid dissociation of “cold” excitons in
the 3D system through scattering with optical phonons, an effect which
is precluded in the 2D system due to the large exciton binding energy.
These results constitute a fundamental insight into how dimensionality
affects the relaxation dynamics of unbound and bound electron–hole
pairs in halide perovskite NPls. Importantly, these findings will
facilitate the development and choice of material parameters for optical
devices relying on high speeds and cutoff frequencies, for example,
photodetectors and all-optical switches. With relaxation times on
the order of 0.3 ps, the 2D system could lead to optoelectronic devices
with switching times in the THz regime. However, the embedding medium
is highly critical to achieving these speeds.

Methods
Synthesis
of Perovskite Nanoplatelets (2D and Quasi-3D)
In a typical
synthesis, 10 mL of toluene, 0.5 mL of oleylamine, and
0.5 mL of oleic acid were added to a mixture of 0.16 mmol MAI and
0.16 mmol PbI2 precursor powders in a 20 mL glass bottle.
The reaction mixture was subjected to tip sonication (SonoPlus HD
3100, Bandelin) at 50% of its maximum power for 30 min. During sonication,
the formation of the perovskite is evident through the change of color
of the solution from yellow to black via orange and
red. The as-obtained solution contains NCs of different sizes and
shapes. The as-prepared colloidal solution was centrifuged at a speed
of 8000 rpm for 10 min. Then, the supernatant which contained thin
plates was separated from the 3D NPls present in the sediment. The
sediment was washed with toluene twice and then redispersed in toluene
for further studies. The colloidal solution of 3 ML NPls was obtained
by adding 200 μL of the initial supernatant to 10 mL of toluene.
The resultant colloidal solution appears orange. The morphology of
the obtained NPls was characterized with a transmission electron microscope
(TEM) operating at an accelerating voltage of 80–100 kV (JEOL
JEM-1011). For TEM characterization of 3 ML NPls, 3 mL of the as-obtained
orange color solution was centrifuged at a speed of 14,000 rpm for
20 min, and then the sediment was redispersed in 0.3 mL of hexane.

Steady-State Optical Measurements
UV–vis absorption
spectra of perovskite NPls in solution were recorded using a Varian
Cary 5000 UV–vis-IR spectrometer. PL measurements were acquired
with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent
Technologies).

Ultrafast Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
We have
employed transient DTS to compare carrier relaxation and recombination
dynamics in 2D and quasi-3D halide perovskite NPls. These NPls are
dissolved as colloids in toluene and are investigated at room temperature
(300 K). Transient differential transmission spectra were taken with
a custom built transient absorption spectrometer from Newport Inc.
As light source, a 1 kHz femtosecond Ti:Sa amplifier system (Libra,
Coherent Inc.) was used in combination with an optical parametric
amplifier (Opera Solo, Coherent Inc.), providing 100 fs laser pulses
with wavelengths over a wide spectral range (290 nm to 10 μm).
The diameter of the spot size of the excitation beam was about 350
μm. The same laser system was used to generate a white light
probe beam. The samples were measured in ambient conditions in quartz
cuvettes with an optical path length of 2 mm and an excitation wavelength
of 400 nm (well above the continuum absorption onset). The difference
in transmission ΔT with and without the pump
laser pulse present was measured as a function of the time delay τ
between pump and probe pulses. For both samples and for all time delays,
the differential transmission spectra shown in Figure 2b,c exhibit a maximum bleaching signal located
spectrally at the position of the 1s exciton resonance, as determined
from the linear absorption spectra (Figure 1a and Figure S3). This bleaching reaches a maximum after approximately 1 ps and
decays subsequently on a much longer time scale.
