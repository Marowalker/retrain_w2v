Cyclophanes
are macrocyclic supramolecular hosts famous for their
ability to bind atomic or molecular guests via noncovalent
interactions within their well-defined cavities. In a similar way,
porous crystalline networks, such as metal–organic frameworks,
can create microenvironments that enable controlled guest binding
in the solid state. Both types of materials often consist of synthetic
components, and they have been developed within separate research
fields. Moreover, the use of biomolecules as their structural units
has remained elusive. Here, we have synthesized a library of organic
cyclophanes and studied their electrostatic self-assembly with biological
metal-binding protein cages (ferritins) into ordered structures. We
show that cationic pillar[5]arenes and ferritin cages form biohybrid
cocrystals with an open protein network structure. Our cyclophane–protein
cage frameworks bridge the gap between molecular frameworks and colloidal
nanoparticle crystals and combine the versatility of synthetic supramolecular
hosts with the highly selective recognition properties of biomolecules.
Such host–guest materials are interesting for porous material
applications, including water remediation and heterogeneous catalysis.

Supramolecular
materials rely
often on macrocycles, such as cyclophanes consisting of aromatic rings
and aliphatic carbons, to achieve host–guest chemistry.1 Calixarenes2 and pillararenes3 are well-known cyclophanes, capable of forming
cup- and barrel-shaped cavities, respectively. Their ability to bind
various small molecular guests is well-established and can be tuned
through synthetic modifications. In particular, the guest binding
of pillararene hosts changes dramatically when the number or OH group
substitution of the hydroquinone units is modified.4 This variability has made pillararenes relevant to applications,
for example, in rapid removal of organic micropollutants from water,5 host–guest complexation of drug molecules,6 all-solid-state lithium batteries,7 and artificial membrane channels.8

The cavity type of the materials can be further modified
by arranging
the building blocks into crystalline networks.9 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a classic example that
can achieve very high surface area and uptake of various gases,10 (chiral) catalysts,11 or even a large biomolecular guest such as proteins and DNA.12−15 Furthermore, pillararenes have been crystallized into porous structures
alone16 or together with MOFs17 to form highly porous structures that can be
used, for example, to molecularly sort alkanes.18 Beyond the small molecular host, colloidal nanoparticle
supraspheres can be organized into higher-order structures. Their
interparticle voids can be several nanometers in diameter and have
recently been demonstrated to efficiently take up hydrophobic guest
molecules19 or to reversibly trap molecules
for enhanced reactivity and stereoselectivity.20 Incorporating MOFs into a mesoporous structure can further
improve mass diffusion properties of the material, which highlights
the importance of hierarchical frameworks in single-crystalline form.21

The diversity of synthetic host molecules
is rich and expanding;
however, they are still much less sophisticated than those observed
in nature.22 Naturally occurring protein-based
hosts have evolved to carry out highly specific functions.23 Among these, ferritins are a key class of protein
cages that are responsible for the nucleation and storage of elementary
iron in living organisms.24 They have also
been shown to function as versatile supramolecular templates for the
synthesis of different inorganic materials25 and encapsulation of active biomolecules.26 The exactly defined structure of ferritin can also be utilized to
prepare large 3D crystal structures using a protein–metal–organic
approach27 or electrostatic interactions.28,29 An intriguing feature of such structures is that they can be used
to direct the formation of nanoparticle superlattices, as placing
an inorganic particle inside the cage does not affect its capability
to form ordered structures.30,31 Furthermore, apoferritin
single crystals have been utilized for structural characterization
of the formation of sub-nanoclusters within the ferritin cage.32 In general, protein crystals with large voids
can function in ways similar to those of other porous structures and
host various guests via supramolecular interactions.33−36

In this article, we present a framework material that combines
synthetic cyclophane hosts and native metal-binding protein cages.
The advantage is that such an approach offers means to combine different
hosts with specific recognition properties. Such materials have been
shown to exhibit improved mass diffusion properties, and they enable
binding of organic molecules close to catalytically active inorganic
centers, which can be used to develop efficient and recyclable catalysts.21 We describe the synthesis of several cationic
cyclophane hosts, consisting of resorcinarenes and pillararenes and
show that hosts with more than five protonatable amines can efficiently
bind negatively charged apoferritin protein cage particles and form
large complexes. When the number and orientation of electrostatic
interactions between the host and apoferritin are optimized, the system
self-assembles into a porous cyclophane–protein cage framework
(CPF). In the case of symmetrically cationic pillar[5]arene with 10
cationic charges, the CPF adopts a crystal structure where the apoferritin
forms a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, and the pillar[5]arene
hosts are electrostatically bridging the protein lattice and occupying
the void spaces between the particles.

Results and Discussion
Apoferritin (aFT) from Pyrococcus furiosus was chosen as the protein part due to its well-defined size (diameter
∼12 nm), spherical shape, and hollow cavity of ∼8 nm.
The cage consists of 24 protein subunits with 432 point group symmetry
(Figure 1a) and has
a total molecular weight of approximately 0.5 MDa.37 There are eight three-fold and six four-fold channels that
span the cage and allow diffusion into the cavity. The cationic resorcin[4]arene
hosts were synthesized by reacting the upper rim 2-position of the
phenyl group with benzyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected amine in the presence
of excess formaldehyde in a Mannich condensation reaction.38,39 Finally, the Boc protection was removed using acid hydrolysis to
achieve resorcin[4]arene hosts with 4, 8, and 16 amines (hosts R(4+), R(8+), and R(16+), respectively).
Additionally, a negatively charged control resorcinarene R(4−) was prepared. The synthesis of pillar[5]arenes with 5 (P(5+)) or 10 (P(10+)) quaternized amines was carried out
by first preparing the macrocycle with either ethyl bromide or with
ethylenediamine methyl acetate functionalization and finally converted
to quaternary ammonium groups by either trimethylamine (P(10+)) or methyl iodide (P(5+)) treatment. The key synthesis
steps and a schematic presentation of all the prepared cationic hosts
are presented in Figure 1b–d, respectively. Full experimental details together with
characterization data are given in the Supporting Information section 1 (Schemes S1–S4 and Figures S1–S6).

pillar[5]arene (P) hosts. (d) Schematic presentation
of all the hosts used in this study. Diameters (dhost) of the cationic hosts are approximately 1.5–2
nm.

Initially, the hosts’ ability
to bind and complex aFT into
larger assemblies was studied by following the increase in count rate
with dynamic light scattering (DLS). An aqueous solution of aFT (100
mg L–1) was slowly titrated with the host (0–80
mg L–1). The assemblies form almost instantaneously
after host addition. Figure 2a presents the titration curves for all host compounds. The
hosts with a high number of cationic amines (R(16+), R(8+), and P(10+)) were able to fully complex
aFT at low concentrations (cH < 20
mg L–1) as indicated by the rapid increase in the
observed count rate and hydrodynamic diameter (to ∼2 μm, Figure S7a). In the case of P(10+), maximum intensity is achieved at 12 mg L–1, which
corresponds to approximately 25 hosts per aFT. However, the hosts
with an intermediate amount of positive charges ((R(4+) and P(5+)) were able to bind the aFT but at much higher
concentrations (cH > 50 mg L–1) and lower final count rate. As expected, the negatively charged
resorcinarene R(4−) was not able to interact efficiently
with aFT due to the lack of attractive electrostatic interactions,
and consequently, no changes in the count rate were observed.

and crystal structure of aFT–host
complexes. (a) aFT solution titrated with different hosts monitored
with DLS shows that the highly cationic hosts complex aFT efficiently.
(b) End point of the titration in panel a titrated with NaCl shows
that the complexes can be disassembled by increasing the electrolyte
concentration. (c) Electrophoretic mobility and ζ-potential

X-ray scattering (SAXS) curves measured for the different aFT–host
complexes at various electrolyte concentrations. Ordered assemblies
are achieved only for the aFT–P(10+) complex at
20 mM NaCl. (e) SAXS data compared to the theoretical fcc scattering
structure factor S(q), fitted model, and free aFT
(data curves offset in y-direction for clarity).
Inset: Miller indices of assigned reflections for the fcc structure versus measured q-vector positions for
indexed peaks yield unit cell dimensions of a = 20.5
nm (space group Fm3̅m, number
225). The (200) peak, which coincides with aFT form factor minimum,
is marked with a filled symbol.

Because the electrostatic interactions are sensitive to the
presence
of electrolytes and can be screened by increasing the electrolyte
concentrations, we studied how the assemblies are affected by the
addition of NaCl (0–200 mM). All complexes could be disassembled
by NaCl addition (Figure 2b). In the case of P(10+), the disassembly was
more complete than with the other hosts and took place at NaCl concentrations
above 30 mM. Full disassembly of these complexes could also be induced
by lowering the pH close to the isoelectric point of aFT (∼4.5)
or by temperature increase to 60 °C (Figure S8). The resorcinarene host-based assemblies did not disassemble
completely at medium 50 mM NaCl concentration, which can be explained
by their partial amphiphilic nature and the presence of attractive
hydrophobic interactions between the building blocks. At 200 mM NaCl
concentration, the complexes are almost fully disassembled and free
aFT particles are mostly observed (Figure S7b). Electrophoretic mobility and ζ-potential (ζp) measurements
presented in Figure 2c verify the overall negative charge of the free aFT particles (ζp
= −11.6 mV). The complexes have clearly a lower negative charge,
and again, the highest charge can be associated with the assemblies
that are formed with the highest number of protonatable amines (see Figure S7c for all mobility data). For the R(16+)-, R(8+)-, and P(10+)-based
assemblies, ζp values of >10 mV are routinely observed.

We then turned to the formation of ordered CPF structures from
aFT and the prepared hosts. We have previously shown that the electrostatic
attraction in such systems must be carefully controlled if crystalline
assemblies are to be formed.31 At low electrolyte
concentration, the oppositely charged building blocks are strongly
attracted to each other, and consequently, kinetically trapped systems
with the lack of long-range order form easily.40 The attraction must be pushed into a weak regime (few kBT) by increasing the electrolyte
concentration that modulates the electrostatic interactions. Increasing
the electrolyte concentration too much screens the attractive interactions
and prevents assembly formation almost entirely, as already shown
by the DLS data. All hosts were therefore assembled with aFT in a
range of different NaCl concentrations (0–40 mM) and studied
by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to estimate the degree of crystallinity.
Surprisingly, none of the resorcinarene hosts could assemble to ordered
frameworks with aFT even when thoroughly optimized. Only the P(10+) was able to form ordered structures at 20 mM NaCl concentration,
as indicated by the clear Bragg reflections (Figure 2d). Again, the alkyl chains on the lower
rim of the resorcinarene hosts can provide additional attractive hydrophobic
interactions, which cannot be screened by the electrolyte addition,
resulting in poorly ordered assemblies. The less charged hosts, including
the P(5+), cannot provide sufficient interactions to
yield large ordered assemblies.

The 2D scattering pattern measured
directly from a solution of
aFT–P(10+) crystals shows clear Debye rings, which
indicate the presence of multiple crystals with isotropic orientation.
Such patterns are often measured from powder-like samples and are
typical of polycrystalline morphology. The intensity maxima are found
from the azimuthally integrated curve at qhkl = 0.053, 0.086, and 0.102 Å–1 (Figure 2e). The
relative peak positions (qhkl/q*, here q* = 0.0306 Å–1) indicate an fcc lattice as they coincide with the
first allowed reflections of an fcc lattice, which are the (111),
(200), (220), and (311) reflections found at qhkl/q* = √3, √4,
√8, and √11, respectively. The (200) peak coincides
with the form factor minimum of the aFT, which explains why it is
only weakly detectable at ∼0.061 Å–1. The lattice constant aSAXS was estimated
from the SAXS data by plotting the quadratic Miller indices against
the measured q values (Figure 2e inset). A linear regression yielded √(h2 + k2 + l2) = 32.67 q (Å–1), and for the observed fcc lattice, aSAXS = 2π × 32.67 Å = 20.5 nm. The comparison to a simulated
scattering curve from a finite fcc model and the corresponding structure
factor (S(q)) confirms the Fm3̅m Bravais lattice space group
(number 225). The calculated nearest neighbor aFT center-to-center
distance is 14.5 nm, which leaves a ∼2.5 nm space between the
adjacent aFT particles. These dimensions correspond well with the
size of the aFT cage (daFT ∼ 12
nm) separated by the P(10+) host (dhost ∼ 1.5 nm).

To visualize and further analyze
the formed lattices, we turned
to cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). A vitrified
sample from the freshly prepared solution of the crystals was imaged
at 300 kV acceleration voltage. Figure 3a shows a typical small crystallite viewed along the
[110] projection axis. The highly ordered arrangement of individual
aFT particles is clearly visible. Low-magnification images showing
multiple highly ordered complexes from random orientations of the
lattices are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S9). From these images, it is possible to find all the expected
projections of the fcc lattice. Figure 3b shows the filtered inverse Fourier transform from
selected Fourier components of lattice projections viewed along [100],
[110], and [111] projection axes. The observed images match closely
with the expected projections of the model unit cell. Measuring the
dimensions of the lattice along the [110] projection yields a lattice
constant, aTEM = 20.5 nm, which matches
exactly with the SAXS data.

face (bottom). (e) Image of the 2 × 2 unit cell demonstrates
the highly porous structure of the protein cage crystal. aFT is shown
as a ring (center slice) to illustrate the hollow cavity.

The relation between the crystal structure and
crystal habit can
be directly observed when imaging the crystals with optical microscopy.
During growth, the crystals develop a clear octahedral habit (Figure 3d), and the dimensions
of the crystal can easily be >10 μm (Figure S10a). aFT crystallization has been observed to proceed in
the {111} lattice plane by the formation of step edges.41 Also in the case aFT–P(10+) crystals, the surface energy is presumably smallest for the close-packed
{111} faces, and growth of these eight faces leads to the observed
octahedral habit (Figure S10b,c). The structure
contains large cavities (Figure 3e), where the largest octahedral and tetrahedral voids
are 8.5 and 5.8 nm in diameter, respectively. By assuming a spherical
aFT particle with an inner hollow core, the space not occupied by
ferritin protein subunits is very large and consists of approximately
66% of the volume of the unit cell (Figure S11). This shows that the structure has a percolated network of large
voids between the aFT particles that can be occupied by the P(10+) hosts.

To obtain an insight into the interactions
between P(10+) and aFT, we used molecular dynamics simulations.
First, an atomistic
model for both interacting species (Figure 4a, top) was created. Analysis of the electrostatic
potential of the aFT cage surface revealed that it has a net negative
charge. There are several negatively charged patches, but most of
the negative charge of ferritin is located around the pores present
at the three-fold symmetry axes, which constitute potential binding
sites for the positively charged P(10+) (Figure 4a, bottom). However, binding
to the other negatively charged patches can most likely also take
place in this system. The large size of aFT prevents atomistic simulation
of the full cage. Thus, as recently done to study the interaction
of positively charged binders with viral capsids42 and microtubules,43 we first
focused on the study of the local binding between one P(10+) and one three-fold binding site on the aFT cage. We cut a portion
of the cage constituted by the protein chains surrounding the pore
(Figure 4b, black α-helices)
and their closest neighbors (gray). One P(10+) molecule
was then placed in close vicinity above the pore and was observed
to bind and equilibrate onto the cage pore by means of unbiased all-atom
molecular dynamics (AA-MD) simulation in explicit water and ions (Figure 4b). Full computational
details are provided in the Methods section
and in the Supporting Information (Table
S1). Metadynamics simulations (Figure 4c) then allowed us to quantify the free energy of binding
of P(10+) to the cage pore as ΔG = −13 ± 1.4 kcal mol–1 (average ±
standard error). Analysis of the nonbond interactions conducted on
the unbiased AA-MD trajectories (Figure 4d) indicated that the P(10+) binding is controlled by favorable interactions with negatively
charged glutamate (Glu) amino acids (Glu 109/121), particularly dense
in the pore region (capturing ∼96% of the total nonbond interaction
with the surface). Of this interaction with Glu residues, ∼70%
is controlled by electrostatic interactions (Figure 4d).

and total interaction energy between P(10+) and aFT (black).
(e) Comparison of the total nonbonded interaction energies in the
systems A (one P(10+) and one aFT, black) and B (one P(10+) and two aFT, orange and purple for aFT (1) and aFT
(2)); the interaction energies are of similar strength.

Next, starting from the equilibrated 1:1 P(10+)–aFT
obtained from AA-MD, we built another molecular model containing a
second cage pore region symmetrically bound to the same binder (Figure 4e, 1:2 system). This
model was equilibrated in explicit water and counterions by means
of AA-MD simulation, providing information on the interactions of P(10+) bridging two cages. The extracted data demonstrated
that a single P(10+) can stably interact with two cages.
From this AA-MD simulation, we could observe that the interaction
is symmetric, indicating that the binding to a second cage does not
impair the binding to the first one.

Conclusion
We
have laid out the rules for preparing framework materials from
synthetic cyclophanes and protein cages. A facially symmetric pillar[5]arene
with 10 protonatable amines was identified as the optimal host to
electrostatically self-assemble with ferritin cages to yield ordered
framework structures. The crystals have large interconnected voids
between the protein cages that are in the size range of several nanometers.
We envision that following the presented design parameters, it is
possible to prepare CPFs from a variety of cyclophanes and tune the
binding properties of the resulting framework materials. Furthermore,
it would be possible to expand the design space of CPFs by using de novo engineered protein cages.44−46 These developments
could in the future lead to an efficient heterogeneous catalyst, where
the cyclophanes are able to trap guest molecules close to the catalytic
sites of the biomolecules,20 multifunctional
water remediation materials,47 or preparation
of zeolite-type structures with rod-like biomolecules.48

Methods
Dynamic Light
Scattering and ζ-Potential Measurements
The hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) of the
assemblies was measured using a Malvern Instruments DLS device (Zetasizer
Nano ZS Series) with a 4 mW He–Ne ion laser at a wavelength
of 633 nm and an avalanche photodiode detector at an angle of 173°.
Experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Plastibrand semimicro
poly(methyl methacrylate) cuvettes and Malvern disposable ζ-cells
were used for the size and electrophoretic mobility measurements,
respectively. Zetasizer software (Malvern Instruments) was used to
obtain the particle size distributions and ζ-potentials.

Cryogenic
Transmission Electron Microscopy
The cryo-TEM
images were collected using JEM 3200FSC field emission microscope
(JEOL) operated at 300 kV in bright-field mode with Omega-type zero-loss
energy filter. The images were acquired with Gatan digital micrograph
software, and the specimen temperature was maintained at −187
°C. The cryo-TEM samples were prepared by placing 3 μL
of a freshly prepared aqueous dispersion of the sample on a 200 mesh
copper grid with holey carbon support film (CF-Quantifoil) and plunge-freezed
using Vitrobot with 3 s blotting time under 100% humidity. The TEM
grids were plasma-cleaned using a Gatan Solarus (model 950) plasma
cleaner for 30 s before placing the sample.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
The aqueous samples were
sealed between two Kapton foils inside a metal washer. The sample
environment was evacuated to reduce background scattering from air.
The SAXS was measured using a Bruker Microstar microfocus rotating
anode X-ray source (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å).
The beam was monochromated and focused by a Montel multilayer focusing
monochromator (Incoatec). The X-ray beam was further collimated by
four collimation slits (JJ X-ray), resulting in a final spot size
of less than 1 mm at the sample position. A Hi-Star 2D area detector
(Bruker) was used to collect the scattered intensity. Sample-to-detector
distance was 1.59 m, and a silver behenate standard sample was used
for the calibration of the length of the scattering vector q. One-dimensional SAXS data were obtained by azimuthally
averaging the 2D scattering data, and the magnitude of the scattering
vector q is given by q = 4π
sin θ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle.

Sample
Preparation for SAXS, Cryo-TEM, and Optical Microscopy
Cyclophane–aFT
samples were prepared by combining 6 μL
of aqueous aFT solution (15 mg mL–1, Pyrococcus furiosus, Molecular Links Rome), 3.5 μL
20 mM Tris pH 8.5 buffer, 1.5 μL of 0–400 mM NaCl solution,
and 4 μL of 10 mg mL–1 cyclophane in water,
in this order. The samples were gently mixed with a pipet and allowed
to set.

All-Atom Simulations
All simulations were conducted
using the GROMACS 5.1.2 software and the PLUMED 2 plugin.49,50 The atomistic model for P(10+) was parametrized with
the general Amber force field, and aFT was parametrized using the
Amber force field ff12SB. The P(10+) binding energy (ΔG) was calculated from metadynamics
simulations. All computational details on the creation of the molecular
systems, their equilibration, and the simulation parameters used in
AA-MD and metadynamics simulations are provided in the Supporting Information.
