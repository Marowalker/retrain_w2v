Energy
transfer allows energy to be moved from one quantum emitter
to another. If this process follows the Förster mechanism,
efficient transfer requires the emitters to be extremely close (<10
nm). To increase the transfer range, nanophotonic structures have
been explored for photon- or plasmon-mediated energy transfer. Here,
we fabricate high-quality silver plasmonic resonators to examine long-distance
plasmon-mediated energy transfer. Specifically, we design elliptical
resonators that allow energy transfer between the foci, which are
separated by up to 10 μm. The geometry of the ellipse guarantees
that all plasmons emitted from one focus are collected and channeled
through different paths to the other focus. Thus, energy can be transferred
even if a micrometer-sized defect obstructs the direct path between
the focal points. We characterize the spectral and spatial profiles
of the resonator modes and show that these can be used to transfer
energy between green- and red-emitting colloidal quantum dots printed
with subwavelength accuracy using electrohydrodynamic nanodripping.
Rate-equation modeling of the time-resolved fluorescence from the
quantum dots further confirms the long-distance energy transfer.

energy transfer
allows an electronic excitation to move from one quantum emitter (the
“donor”) to another (the “acceptor”).1,2 The excitation is transferred directly through dipole–dipole
interactions, without emission of a photon. The efficiency of this
process depends on the intensity of the electric near-field that the
donor generates at the acceptor. For two dipoles in a homogeneous
medium, the transfer rate scales as 1/r6, where r is the donor–acceptor separation.
Thus, this process is efficient only for small separations (r < 10 nm).3 To transfer energy
between quantum emitters over longer distances, which can be desirable
for quantum technologies,4−6 the emitters must interact via the lower-intensity far-field components of the electric
field. This far-field interaction can be seen as radiative energy
transfer from donors to acceptors via photons.

Nanophotonic structures can be useful for achieving long-distance
energy transfer. For example, such structures can be designed to increase
the electric-field intensity from the donor at the position of the
acceptor.7−9 In photon-mediated energy transfer, the field must
be effectively channeled to, and collected by, the acceptor. Optical
microcavities10,11 or metamaterials12 have been shown to enhance energy transfer for distances
up to 160 nm. For even longer distances, dielectric waveguides can
direct photons from a source to a receiver with low loss but have
limited coupling efficiencies for nanoscale emitters due to their
size mismatch with the diffraction-limited optical mode.13,14

Plasmonic structures offer another approach.15,16 Metal–dielectric interfaces support surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs), which are electromagnetic waves coupled to charge-density
oscillations. These waves can guide energy along a surface.17 Due to the confinement of the plasmon field
to the interface, SPPs can couple to quantum emitters more efficiently
than photons can in dielectric structures.18,19 Indeed, it has been shown that a flat Ag–dielectric interface
mediates energy transfer from a donor to an acceptor fluorophore via SPPs.20 Moreover, plasmonic
waveguides21−23 can be used to direct SPPs launched by an emitter
to a receiver along a one-dimensional structure, providing a direct
connection for energy transfer.24−28 However, whereas such plasmonic waveguides can, in principle, lead
to highly directional energy flow, they also have several disadvantages.
For example, they exhibit significant sensitivity to defects because
only a single channel connects the donor to the acceptor, and enhanced
field confinement leads to a trade-off between high coupling efficiency
and long propagation distance.29

Here, we explore plasmonic resonators with an elliptical shape
as a possible structure to overcome these limitations. Due to their
geometry, elliptical resonators can enable defect-tolerant plasmon-mediated
energy transfer over long distances. Indeed, the utility of the ellipse
for photonics has long been recognized. In 1931, Synge proposed an
optical microscope with a hollow (three-dimensional) ellipsoid with
reflective walls.30 If a source is placed
at one focal point of the ellipse, all emitted light would be directed
to the other focal point upon reflection from the walls. We exploit
a two-dimensional (2D) plasmonic analogue, in which a region of flat
Ag surface is surrounded by an elliptical block reflector (Figure 1). This structure,
which can be fabricated using standard lithographic techniques, collects
all SPPs emitted at one focal point and directs them to the other
focal point, independent of the emission direction of the initial
SPP. Consequently, the plasmonic ellipse is highly tolerant to local
defects because energy is transferred through many paths simultaneously.

Figure 1 Properties
of the plasmonic elliptical resonator. (a) Schematic
of the elliptical resonator. The emitter (donor) and receiver (acceptor)
are placed at the foci F1 and F2, respectively,
and are separated by 2e. All SPPs launched from F1 propagate 2a and undergo one reflection
before arriving at F2 (except for SPPs propagating on the
direct path between F1 and F2). (b) Scanning
electron micrograph (SEM) of a template-stripped Ag elliptical resonator
with 2a = 16 μm and 2e = 10
μm; the reflector height is ∼600 nm. Ag disks are placed
at the two focal points and act as the emitter and receiver, respectively.
The inset shows a magnified image of one of these disks. (c) Scattering
image of a plasmonic ellipse. The Ag disk at the left focal point
is excited with a focused HeNe laser with radial polarization; the
direct reflection of the laser from the focal point is blocked with
a circular spatial filter.

Flat elliptical resonator structures have previously been
realized,
and it was shown that they mimic quantum corrals31 or serve as unidirectional, broad-band scatterers.32 Transferring energy at a single frequency from
one focal point to the other was first investigated by Drezet et al.(33) using an elliptically
shaped Bragg reflector on a gold surface. More recently, elliptical
cavities have been milled into single-crystalline Au flakes to coherently
couple two whispering-gallery-mode antennas separated by distances
up to 2 μm.34,35

We present a plasmonic
elliptical resonator where SPPs mediate
energy transfer over 10 μm between ensembles of quantum emitters.
To first characterize our resonator, we place scattering Ag disks
as plasmon sources at the focal points of the ellipse. Locally excited
plasmons then propagate along closed paths inside the ellipse, leading
to resonator modes. We investigate these modes by measuring broad-band
transmission spectra between the focal points and discuss their influence
on energy transfer. Crucial for practical realizations, the defect
tolerance of the plasmonic ellipse is assessed by measuring the transmitted
signal in the presence of micrometer-sized obstructions placed between
the foci. Finally, to demonstrate energy transfer between quantum
emitters, we print colloidal quantum dots (QDs) at the focal points
of the plasmonic ellipse. We study the dynamics of energy transfer
between the QDs with time- and spectrally resolved measurements and
show that these dynamics can be captured well using a rate-equation
model. Hence, our findings demonstrate that plasmonic ellipses can
provide defect-tolerant energy transfer across long distances.

Results
and Discussion
The schematic in Figure 1a highlights the two key properties of plasmonic
ellipses
for energy transfer. First, every SPP ray leaving one focal point
(F1) will arrive at the other focal point (F2) after a single reflection at the resonator wall. Second, the path
length with one reflection between the two focal points is always
equal to twice the long half-axis of the ellipse, 2a. This property ensures that all SPPs launched at F1 interfere
constructively at F2, independent of the emission direction
of the initial ray and the direct distance between the focal points,
2e.

We fabricate our plasmonic elliptical resonator
structures using
template stripping.36,37 First, an elliptical groove is
patterned into a Si substrate using electron-beam lithography followed
by HBr plasma etching. Then, Ag is evaporated onto the patterned Si
chip and removed via template stripping (see Methods and section S1 in the Supporting Information for details). The result is a smooth
silver surface with roughness down to 0.3 nm root-mean-squared37 that is surrounded by an elliptical Ag protrusion
acting as a reflector for SPPs. The scanning electron micrograph (SEM)
in Figure 1b shows
such a resonator with a protrusion that is ∼600 nm high and
2 μm wide. The focal points of the ellipse are separated by
2e = 10 μm and the long half-axis of the ellipse
is a = 8 μm. These parameters, which provide
a good compromise between large focal-point separation and sufficient
energy transfer, are used throughout this work.

In our optical
experiments, we use two methods to excite SPPs at
the focal points. The first approach is to focus laser light at a
Ag disk precisely placed at the focal point (see inset in Figure 1b). These disks (200
nm in diameter and 100 nm in height) can be incorporated into the
fabrication process using electron-beam lithography. They allow for
broad-band coupling of free-space light into SPPs in the ellipse (see
section S2 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for details). Specifically, we utilize a radially polarized laser
beam to create a strong longitudinal electric-field component in the
center of the focus.1,38 This electric-field component
excites a dipole moment in the Ag disk normal to the flat metal surface,
which then couples efficiently to transverse-magnetic SPP modes.17 In contrast to plasmon excitation by scattering
of a linearly polarized laser beam,33 the
symmetry of the radially polarized laser beam ensures that SPPs are
launched isotropically in-plane. The second approach to launch SPPs
in the ellipse relies on near-field coupling to fluorescent QDs,39 placed precisely in the focal points using electrohydrodynamic
nanodripping (see Methods and section S1 in
the Supporting Information).22,40 After exciting the QDs locally with a focused laser, they launch
SPPs into the ellipse.

Figure 1c shows
an image formed on an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD)
camera of an ellipse for which a radially polarized HeNe laser (λ
= 632.8 nm) was focused onto the Ag disk placed at F1.
The image shows a bright spot at F2, where the second Ag
disk scatters the SPPs that arrive at the receiver into photons—evidence
that the plasmonic ellipse can mediate energy transfer. The direct
reflection of the excitation laser from F1 is blocked using
a spatial filter in an intermediate image plane in the optical path
(see Methods and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The halo around F1 is caused by the excitation laser that is not blocked by
the circular spatial filter.

Additionally, we observe a particular
intensity pattern along the
reflector wall. To explain this, we must consider that a portion of
the SPPs leaving F1 do not scatter at F2 but
propagate back toward F1. Hence, to first order, any particular
point along the reflector wall can be reached by SPPs coming from
F1via two separate paths: either directly
or after one reflection and passage through F2. The difference
in the path length leads to either constructive or destructive interference
of SPPs at any point along the reflector (see section S3 and Figure
S3 in the Supporting Information for further
details). The particular spatial interference pattern at the frequency
of the HeNe laser is visible along the reflector wall in Figure 1c.

To this
point, we have explained the plasmonic ellipse using a
ray picture (i.e., rays of SPPs propagating from
F1 to F2). However, if the phase that an SPP
accumulates during one round trip from F1 to F2 and back to F1 is a multiple of 2π, a source of
SPPs at F1 self-interferes constructively, leading to a
resonance.32 Importantly, this round-trip
phase depends on the round-trip length 4a, the SPP
wavelength, and the phase difference imparted by the two reflections,
but not on the distance between the focal points 2e. The occurrence of resonances leads to a second equivalent picture
where the plasmonic ellipse is treated as a resonator with particular
eigenmodes (i.e., standing waves) that can be excited.

To achieve energy transfer between quantum emitters, which have
characteristic absorption and emission spectra, energy is transferred
by coupling the emitter and receiver to the same eigenmode of the
elliptical resonator. Every eigenmode is characterized by a resonance
frequency and its spatial electric-field-intensity distribution. For
energy transfer, both the spectral and spatial overlap of the donor
and acceptor with the eigenmodes are essential.

To probe the
eigenmode spectrum supported by our particular resonator,
we utilized broad-band light generated from a sapphire crystal and
a 1040 nm pulsed laser (see Methods). The
resulting supercontinuum pulses were focused onto the Ag disk at F1, launching broad-band SPPs into the resonator. Spectra were
then collected for those SPPs that were scattered at the second Ag
disk at F2 using an imaging spectrograph. Figure 2a shows the transmission spectrum
from F1 to F2 for our plasmonic ellipse. This
spectrum reveals all resonator modes that lie within the supercontinuum
bandwidth (∼550 to 650 nm, black dotted line in Figure 2a) and are excited by the first
Ag disk. In contrast to smaller plasmonic ellipses (a ∼ 1 μm),31,32 our structure has many
eigenmodes. However, only the modes where the electric-field intensity
is strongly concentrated at the two focal points of the ellipse are
detected in the transmission spectrum and contribute to the energy
transfer. This explains the different peak amplitudes of the eigenmodes
in Figure 2a, which
are determined by the electric-field intensities at the two focal
points. The observed eigenmodes are spectrally separated by ∼6.7
nm and have a full width at half-maximum line width of ∼5 nm
at 550 nm. Based on these numbers, we can estimate a quality factor
of Q ≈ 110 and a finesse of  for this particular resonator. Compared
to Ag nanowires, previously used for plasmon-mediated energy transfer,
our Q is higher by a factor of 2.41 The resonator finesse and the emission and absorption spectra
of the quantum emitters determine whether one or several of the resonator
eigenmodes contribute to the energy-transfer process.

resonator. (a) Experimental transmission spectrum (blue line) from
F1 to F2 of an ellipse with distance 2e = 10 μm between the focal points and long half-axis a = 8 μm. The spectrum is measured by focusing a broad-band
supercontinuum laser beam on a Ag disk at F1 and collecting
the scattered photons from SPPs arriving at a Ag disk at F2. The black dotted line shows the reflection spectrum of the excitation
laser focused on a flat Ag surface for comparison (see also Figure
S4 in the Supporting Information). (b)

spectrum of an ellipse with the same parameters as in (a). An electric
point-dipole source was placed at F1, and the electric-field
intensity at F2 was measured as a function of wavelength.
(c) Image of an elliptical resonator (without Ag disk at F2), excited with a radially polarized HeNe laser source (λ =
632.8 nm) focused at F1. Along the reflector, SPPs are
scattered with an intensity modulation characteristic for the excited
eigenmode. (d) Electric-field intensity distribution of the ellipse
eigenmode closest to the HeNe wavelength, calculated using COMSOL
Multiphysics. The electric-field intensity shows two strong maxima
at the focal points of the ellipse, indicating that this mode is useful
for energy transfer. At the position of the inner reflector wall,
the electric-field intensity of the eigenmode is plotted to allow
direct comparison with the scattered SPP intensity in the experiment
(panel c).

The eigenmodes that we detect
in the transmission spectrum for
our plasmonic ellipse can be understood by performing frequency-domain
finite-element calculations with COMSOL Multiphysics (see section
S3 in the Supporting Information). It has
already been shown32 that a simple dispersive
plasmonic Fabry–Pérot resonator model can predict the
approximate wavelength spacing of the resonance peaks of an elliptical
structure (see section S3 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) but not the relative coupling strength
of the source and receiver to these modes.2 Our model can calculate both. We consider an electric dipole source
perpendicular to the surface placed at focal point F1 and
evaluate the electric-field intensity polarized normal to the surface
at focal point F2. Figure 2b shows the calculated transmission spectrum for an
ellipse with the same dimensions as in the experiments (but without
Ag disks at the focal points). It shows multiple sets of resonances,
each with an intensity modulated due to the wavelength-dependent electric-field
overlap between the eigenmode and the dipole (see section S3 in the Supporting Information). The individual resonances
have line widths down to 1 nm and peak spacings of 6.5 nm (at 550
nm). From these values, we obtain a resonator quality factor of Q ≈ 550 and a finesse of , numbers that are significantly higher
than the values determined from experiment. Most likely, this discrepancy
results from higher losses in our experimental structure such as out-scattering
at the Ag disks, increased ohmic losses in the metal, and lower reflectance
at the reflector. Nevertheless, our simulation qualitatively captures
the experimental transmission spectrum shown in Figure 2a and its particular intensity modulations.
The finite size of the Ag disks in contrast to the point dipole used
in the model can explain the deviation in the resonance position between
the simulated and experimental transmission spectrum (see section
S3 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). From the transmission spectrum, we conclude that the plasmonic
ellipse supports many resonant modes with closely spaced frequencies
that couple focal points F1 and F2 with a strength
depending on their spatial electric-field distributions.

The
spatial electric-field intensity distribution of a single eigenmode
can also be probed experimentally. For example, by exciting a Ag disk
at F1 of the elliptical resonator with the single-frequency
HeNe laser, SPP out-scattering along the edge of the ellipse can be
observed (Figure 2c).
It is known that when SPPs hit a block reflector, a small fraction
of their intensity is scattered into photons.42 In our experiment, this appears as out-scattering with an intensity
proportional to the SPP electric-field intensity at the reflector.
The intensity profile observed along the elliptical reflector in Figure 2c is characteristic
for the excited eigenmode. Qualitatively, this modulation can be understood
in terms of two SPP rays that interfere at the reflector because they
arrive through different paths from F1 (see section S3
and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Figure 2d shows
the full intensity distribution of
the electric-field component perpendicular to the Ag surface of the
eigenmode (λ = 632.6 nm) closest to the HeNe wavelength calculated
with COMSOL Multiphysics. In addition to an intensity profile along
the edge of the ellipse that is similar to what we observe experimentally
(Figure 2c), the calculated
eigenmode shows two strong intensity maxima at the foci of the ellipse
where the emitter and receiver are placed. This strong confinement
of the electric field is beneficial for the energy-transfer efficiency
of plasmonic ellipses compared to a flat Ag interface. However, because
the electric-field hot spots at the focal points are as tight as ∼200
nm in the lateral direction, precise placement of the donor and acceptor
at the foci is required.

Reliable transfer of energy
from emitter to receiver also requires tolerance to defects. Energy
transfer in Ag nanowires or on flat Ag surfaces would be completely
inhibited when a fabrication imperfection (e.g.,
dust particle) disrupts the direct path between donor and acceptor.
This problem can, in principle, be alleviated in ellipses, where energy
is transferred from F1 to F2 along many different
paths. Figure 3a shows
an electron micrograph of a plasmonic ellipse containing an intentionally
placed square defect with a side length of d = 2
μm and the same height as the reflector (600 nm). We measure
the plasmons transmitted between the two focal points by focusing
a radially polarized HeNe laser beam onto the Ag disk placed at F1 (left scatterer in Figure 3a) and imaging the signal scattered by the ellipse
on an EMCCD camera (Figure 3b). Despite the large defect, the bright spot at F2 indicates that an appreciable amount of plasmons arrived at the
acceptor. The SPPs scattered from the edges of the defect also indicate
that energy is lost.

Figure 3 Defect tolerance of plasmonic ellipses. (a) SEM of a template-stripped
elliptical resonator (2e = 10 μm, a = 8 μm) with a square defect of d = 2 μm
side length. (b) Scattering image of a plasmonic ellipse containing
a defect (d = 2 μm). A radially polarized HeNe
laser (λ = 632.8 nm) is used to excite the ellipse at the left
focal point. (c) Boxplot (horizontal line inside box indicates median
value; the box extends from the lower to upper quartile values of
the data; whiskers highlight span of data points) comparing the intensity
of scattered SPPs at the acceptor for six ellipses without a defect,
nine ellipses with a d = 2 μm defect, five
ellipses with a d = 4 μm defect, nine half
ellipses, nine quarter ellipses, and nine structures without an elliptical
reflector. For each case, nine nominally identical ellipses were fabricated.
Structures in which one of the Ag disks were missing were rejected
based on dark-field microscopy images (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). The mean scattered SPP
intensity measured for two Ag disks without an elliptical resonator
(inset) was used to normalize the data. Schematic insets provide an
estimate of the percentage of SPPs arriving at the acceptor position
compared to a plasmonic ellipse without defect.

We quantify the relative amounts of energy lost because of
the
defect by comparing defect-free ellipses to those containing two different
sizes of defects (d = 2 and 4 μm). Minor differences
in fabrication are averaged out by measuring the signal from 5–9
nominally identical resonators for each group on the same sample (see
Figure S5 in the Supporting Information for dark-field images of all resonators). For each measurement,
we excited F1 with a radially polarized HeNe laser and
integrated the signal scattered at F2 over an area of 1.3
× 1.3 μm2. Figure 3c shows a boxplot of the measured intensity
normalized to the mean intensity of two Ag disks that are separated
by the same distance (10 μm) but placed on a flat Ag film without
any reflectors. The presence of the elliptical resonator enhances
the transferred signal by a factor of ∼125 (median value).
Placing a 2 μm defect between the donor and acceptor reduces
the signal by a factor of only 3 compared to an ellipse without a
defect. A 4 μm defect reduces the signal by a factor of 5.5,
but the structure still transmits 24 times more SPPs than a flat Ag
surface absent of any structuring. Removing one-half or three-quarters
of the ellipse reduces the transmitted signal by a factor of 2 and
7.9, respectively. With a very simple model (red-shaded segments and
corresponding percentage values in Figure 3c), we calculated the fraction of emission
angles from F1 for which an SPP ray ends up at F2 after one reflection. This model qualitatively reproduces the reduction
of plasmon transmission that we measured upon introduction of an intentional
defect.

So far, we have characterized the properties of our
plasmonic ellipses
by directly exciting the resonator modes with a laser source. To show
energy transfer between quantum emitters, we also performed experiments
with colloidal QDs. Due to their size-tunable optical properties,
QDs can be synthesized to emit and absorb light across the visible
spectrum.43Figure 4a shows the absorption (dotted lines) and
emission (solid lines) spectra of the two types of CdSe-based core/shell
QDs used in this work (see Methods and section
S1 in the Supporting Information for details).
Photoexcited QDs show fluorescence from clearly defined band-edge
electronic states but, in contrast to fluorescent molecules, can absorb
all photons of higher energy. This property facilitates the energy
transfer from donor to acceptor QDs as the emission from QDs emitting
at higher energy (here, green) always overlaps with the absorption
of QDs emitting at lower energy (here, red). The green-emitting QDs
(green lines in Figure 4a) can thus act as donors and red-emitting QDs (red lines) as acceptors.

process involving the 405 nm laser pump (blue arrow), the cooling

(∼1000) of donor and acceptor QDs at the two focal points (2
μm scale bar). (c–e) Excitation and detection schemes
for the time-resolved measurements. (f) Time-resolved measurements
for the three situations presented in (c–e). The green and
red data correspond to the independent excitation and detection of
the donor and acceptor QDs, as depicted in (c) and (d), respectively.
The gray data correspond to the situation in (e), where a 590 nm long-pass
filter is used to isolate the acceptor photon emission from the SPP
scattering contribution. A rate-equation model (solid lines; see section
S3 in the Supporting Information for details)
captures the dynamics of the decay traces, confirming energy transfer
in our plasmonic ellipses.

To demonstrate plasmon-mediated energy transfer in our elliptical
resonator, we printed subwavelength-sized ensembles of QDs (∼1000
QDs) at the two focal points (inset of Figure 4b). The green line in Figure 4b shows the signal measured from the location
of the green QDs (inset Figure 4b, green arrow) when they are directly excited with a 405
nm pulsed laser source. This spectrum contains a single broad peak
at ∼550 nm, which is at the same position as the green fluorescence
in Figure 4a. After
photoexcitation, the excitons created in the green QDs quickly relax
to the band edge (∼picosecond time scale).44 Therefore, we attribute this spectrum to band-edge fluorescence
of the green donor QDs. The weak fluorescence intensity modulation
at the frequencies of the resonator modes can be attributed to competition
between SPP excitation and photon emission.

The red line in Figure 4b corresponds to
the photon signal measured at the location
of the red acceptor QDs at F2 (inset Figure 4b, red arrow), upon laser excitation of the
green donor QDs at F1. This signal contains two main features.
The first feature at ∼550 nm spectrally overlaps with the donor
emission and can, therefore, be attributed to SPPs launched by the
donor that are scattered into green photons at the acceptor. The closely
spaced peaks in this scattering signal show that the donor is coupled
to the resonances of the ellipse. The second feature at ∼630
nm overlaps with the acceptor emission spectrum (cf. Figure 4a). This signal suggests plasmon-mediated
energy transfer: acceptor fluorescence after photoexcitation of the
donor. Importantly, energy transfer occurs here over QD–QD
separations as large as 10 μm—a distance that is 3 orders
of magnitude larger than typical distances for Förster energy
transfer (<10 nm) through near-field coupling45−47 and 15% larger
than previously achieved for SPP-mediated single-channel energy transfer
on Ag nanowires.28 This distance can be
extended even further (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information for energy-transfer measurements in elliptical
resonators with 2e = 15 μm), but maximization
of the emitter–acceptor separation was not the goal of this
work.

For a more complete analysis, we also performed time-resolved
measurements
on the donor and acceptor QDs. Figure 4f shows the photoluminescence decay traces for the
three different configurations shown in Figure 4c–e. The green and red traces correspond
to the situations in Figure 4c,d, where the donor and acceptor QDs are excited and detected
independently. In this way, the dynamics of the donors and acceptors
are determined separately. The gray trace corresponds to the situation
in Figure 4e, where
the donor is excited with the laser pulse, and the signal from the
acceptor is detected. In this case, a 590 nm long-pass filter was
placed before the detector to filter out the scattering of green SPPs,
emitted by the donor, from the acceptor signal.

The separate
dynamics of the donor QDs (green data in Figure 4f) and acceptor QDs
(red data) both show multiexponential decay, presumably due to variations
in the QDs or in the QD-to-SPP coupling.48 Compared to the decay of the donor QDs in a tetradecane dispersion,
the decay of the donor QDs that are printed in the focus of the ellipse
is shorter because of QD-to-SPP coupling and self-quenching of the
QDs in the assembly (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The evidence for energy transfer lies in the
photoluminescence decay of the acceptor after photoexcitation of the
donor (gray data). The acceptor emission decays more slowly when excited
indirectly via the donor QDs (gray data) than when
excited directly (red data). Due to the long exciton lifetime of the
green QDs, they feed the red QDs over tens of nanoseconds. Therefore,
the slow decay of the green QDs influences the signal from the red
QDs. We would also have expected a rise of a few nanoseconds in the
emission signal from the acceptor QDs upon excitation of the donor
QDs. However, this effect is hardly observable in our experimental
data (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The rise of the red emission may be hidden in our experiments
because, in addition to energy transfer from the donor QDs, the red
emission may be directly excited by our 405 nm laser beam. This can
occur if the focused laser spot is scattered by the QDs at F1, thus generating 405 nm SPPs that travel outward and are focused
to F2 by the resonator structure.

To quantify the
contributions to the red emission from the donor-to-acceptor
energy transfer and the direct excitation by 405 nm SPPs, we developed
an analytical model (see section S4 and Figure S9 in the Supporting Information) that describes the expected
photoluminescence decay dynamics including both contributions. The
solid lines in Figure 4f show the result of fitting the data to this model. From the fit,
we conclude that approximately 34% of the acceptor signal originates
from donor-to-acceptor energy transfer, and 66% of the signal is due
to direct excitation of the acceptor by 405 nm SPPs. In Figure S6
in the Supporting Information, we show
results from reference measurements for which the green donor QDs
were photobleached. These confirm that the red acceptor QDs at F2 are in part excited by 405 nm SPPs in-scattered at F1. Our resonator structure thus facilitates donor-to-acceptor
transfer between quantum emitters over a distance as large as 10 μm,
even by 405 nm SPPs scattered in at the donor location, despite the
low propagation length of SPPs at the excitation laser wavelength
(LSPP = 5.5 μm at λ = 405
nm).

We also estimate the overall donor-to-acceptor energy-transfer
efficiency in our structures. Based on values reported in the literature,
we assume that the exciton-to-SPP coupling efficiency is ∼40%.27,49 Whereas the SPP-to-exciton coupling is very challenging to quantify,
we optimistically assume this efficiency to also be ∼40% in
our case. The SPP reflectivity r of our block reflectors
was measured above 0.9,23,42 and the SPP propagation
length LSPP is 40 μm at λ
= 550 nm.37 Using these values, we obtain
an overall transfer efficiency of 0.4 × 0.4 × r × e–2a/LSPP ≅ 10% for QD-to-QD transfer. This value is
orders of magnitude higher than photon-mediated energy transfer in
free space for the same donor–acceptor separation.1

Conclusions
We have shown that plasmonic
elliptical resonators support eigenmodes
with strong electric-field maxima at the two focal points. These eigenmodes
with quality factors up to Q = 110 can be excited
by a scattering Ag disk or quantum emitters that are placed at one
of the focal points. By printing donor and acceptor QDs with overlapping
emission and absorption spectra at each focal point respectively,
energy can be transferred via SPPs across 10 μm—a
distance that is 15% longer than reported for Ag nanowires.28 Compared to flat Ag, the elliptical resonator
enhances energy transfer by a factor of 125 for a donor–acceptor
separation of 10 μm. Further, we set up a rate-equation model
that captures the most important dynamics of donor excitation, energy
transfer, and acceptor recombination. Due to the full collection angle
of the ellipse, energy transfer within our resonators is tolerant
to 4 μm defects that block the direct path between donor and
acceptor. Thus, despite their larger footprint, elliptical resonators
offer a valuable alternative to Ag nanowires for plasmon-mediated
energy transfer because of their defect tolerance and enhanced energy-transfer
distance. Further, our findings highlight the potential of elliptical
resonators as a platform for long-range energy transfer and allow
investigations of the coupling of single quantum emitters placed in
such structures.

Methods
Fabrication
of Plasmonic Elliptical Resonators
Plasmonic
elliptical resonator structures were fabricated using template stripping.36 Templates for elliptical resonators containing
scattering Ag disks were prepared by a two-step electron-beam (e-beam)
process. Disks with 200 nm diameter, which defined the scatterers,
were created using e-beam lithography (Vistec, NFL 5). After developing
the sample, approximately 100 nm deep holes were etched into the Si
chips using HBr-based inductively coupled plasma etch (Oxford Instruments,
PlasmaPro 100 Cobra, 80 W) for 35 s. Finally, the resist was removed.
The elliptically shaped block reflectors were fabricated in a second
step where elliptical annuli with 2 μm width were defined with
e-beam lithography. Before removing the resist, approximately 600
nm deep trenches were etched into the Si chips using the same HBr-based
inductive coupled plasma etch for 2.5 min. For samples without Ag
disks, only the second lithography step was applied.

A thermal
evaporator (Kurt J. Lesker, Nano36) was used to deposit Ag films.
Deposition of a 1 μm thick Ag film onto the ellipse templates
was performed at high rates (>25 Å s–1)
and
low residual gas pressures (3 × 10–7 mbar).37 The deposited Ag film was template-stripped
by bonding a microscope slide to the film using an ultraviolet-light-curable
epoxy (EpoTek, OG142-95). The Ag-epoxy-glass stack was then stripped
from the template to reveal elliptical resonators. More detail on
the sample fabrication is available in section S1 of the Supporting Information.

Electrohydrodynamic Nanodripping
of QDs
For electrohydrodynamic
nanodripping, we used two inks based on green and red QDs. Dispersions
in hexane of green CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs with a compositionally
graded shell (∼10 nm particle diameter, emission at ∼550
nm, synthesized according to a protocol described by Prins et al.(50)) and red CdSe/CdS/ZnS
core/shell QDs (∼4.1 nm core diameter, emission at ∼630
nm, synthesized according to a protocol described by Kress et al.(23)) were prepared. Hexane
was then replaced by tetradecane as the solvent of the QD dispersions
and the concentration of the green and red ink was adjusted to an
optical density of 2 and 0.5, respectively (measured at the lowest
energy exciton peak in a spectrometer, using a quartz cuvette with
a 1 mm path length). For electrohydrodynamic nanodripping of QDs,
a direct current electric potential of ∼220 V was applied between
a metal-coated nozzle (+) and the template-stripped silver substrate
(ground) to eject ink. Each ensemble of QDs was printed at a separation
of around 5 μm between the nozzle and the plasmonic substrate
by applying a voltage pulse for 120 ms. A complete description of
the preparation of QD inks and printing setup is available in section
S1 of the Supporting Information.

Optical
Measurements
Our experimental setup, which
allows multiple excitation and detection schemes, is shown in Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information. The sample
is mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ti–U)
equipped with a 100× air objective (Nikon, TU Plan Fluor; numerical
aperture of 0.9). To directly launch SPPs by scattering off a Ag disk,
we used a single-mode fiber-coupled HeNe laser (Thorlabs HNL100R,
632.8 nm wavelength) or a supercontinuum generated from a sapphire
crystal using a 1040 nm pump laser (Spectra-Physics, Spirit 1040-8).
A broad-band polarizing beam splitter cube (Thorlabs, CCM1-PBS251)
in combination with a Q-plate (ArcOptix, S-PLATE) converts linear
polarization into radial polarization. To filter out higher-order
transverse modes, the beam is focused through a 15 μm pinhole
using two lenses. A multiwave liquid-crystal variable retarder (Thorlabs,
LCC2415) is used to correct for birefringence of the optical components
in the setup. The radially polarized laser beam was directed to the
sample using a broad-band 50/50 beam splitter (AHF analysentechnik)
and focused with the microscope objective. To excite QDs, a 405 nm
laser diode (Picoquant, D-C-405) was directed to the sample using
a dichroic beam splitter (488 nm long pass, AHF analysentechnik).

Emission from the sample was collected by the objective and sent
through the beam splitter and relay lenses (focal length of 200 mm)
into an imaging spectrometer (Andor, Shamrock 303i). A circular spatial
filter (Cr evaporated on a coated glass window from Thorlabs, WG11010-A),
placed in an intermediate image plane, was used to block the strong
reflection of the laser spot. The emission was dispersed with a grating
of 150 lines/mm (500 nm blaze) and imaged with an air-cooled electron-multiplying
charged-coupled device camera (Andor, iXon 888 Ultra). Real-space
images were obtained using the zero-order mode of the same grating.
For fluorescence measurements, an emission filter (500 nm long-pass,
AHF analysentechnik) was placed directly after the dichroic beam splitter
to filter out the 405 nm excitation light. For time-resolved measurements,
the emission was focused onto an avalanche photodiode (Excelitas,
SPCM-AQRH-14-TR) connected to a time-tagger box (Picoquant, PicoHarp
300).
