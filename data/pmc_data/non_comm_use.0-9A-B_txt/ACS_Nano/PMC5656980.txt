Biological materials achieve directional
reinforcement with oriented
assemblies of anisotropic building blocks. One such example is the
nanocomposite structure of keratinized epithelium on the toe pad of
tree frogs, in which hexagonal arrays of (soft) epithelial cells are
crossed by densely packed and oriented (hard) keratin nanofibrils.
Here, a method is established to fabricate arrays of tree-frog-inspired
composite micropatterns composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars
embedded with polystyrene (PS) nanopillars. Adhesive and frictional
studies of these synthetic materials reveal a benefit of the hierarchical
and anisotropic design for both adhesion and friction, in particular,
at high matrix–fiber interfacial strengths. The presence of
PS nanopillars alters the stress distribution at the contact interface
of micropillars and therefore enhances the adhesion and friction of
the composite micropattern. The results suggest a design principle
for bioinspired structural adhesives, especially for wet environments.

==== Body
Biological
materials often contain
anisotropic building blocks assembled along preferred orientations
to achieve directional reinforcement.1 Musculoskeletal
tissue, wood, and mollusk shells are relevant examples. The directional
assembly of micro- or nanocomponents (e.g., collagen
fibers, cellulose fibers, and inorganic platelets) provides structural
anisotropy and directional mechanical properties in bulk natural materials.
Directionality is also a relevant property in the design of natural
surfaces, like keratinized or cornified epithelium. A relevant example
is the composite structure of the adhesive pads in the digits of tree
and rock frogs.2−8 On the toe pads of tree frogs, hexagonal arrays of (soft) epithelial
cells separated by narrow channels are crossed by densely packed (hard)
keratin nanofibrils (Figure 1).8 These keratin fibers are oriented
at an angle between 60 and 90° relative to the toe pad surface.6,7 Previous reports with living animals4−10 and artificial models11−13 have highlighted the important
role of the surface micropattern to achieve friction enhancement on
humid and flooded surfaces. However, the benefit of the embedded directional
nanofibers in the microcomposite structure remains unclear.

Bioinspired fibrillar adhesives
for attachment in dry environments
(gecko-like) have been studied over the past decade using artificial
micro- and nanostructured models.14−22 Arrays of closely packed nanofibrils are beneficial for conformability
to real, rough surfaces, making the surface apparently “soft”
even if it is composed of hard fibers that are resistant to mechanical
damage and wear during locomotion.18,19 When a large
amount of liquid is present at the contact interface, fibrillar surfaces
are no longer effective for achieving high adhesion and friction,
unless the liquid is drained from the interface by application of
shear forces forming dry contacts.8,11−13 This working mechanism appears to be exploited by tree frogs for
strong attachment during climbing on wet and flooded surfaces, but
with a surface design different than that of geckos. Tree frog toe
pads comprise composite microstructures combining a softer matrix
(epithelial cells) and embedded hard keratin fibers.6,7 In general, a material with low elastic modulus is beneficial for
strong adhesion but not necessarily for strong friction because of
easy wear and damage.23−29 However, both strong adhesion and friction are important for the
jumping-based locomotion of tree frogs.30

The design of composite microstructures on the toe pads may
contribute
to the unique abilities of tree frogs. Fabrication of composites with
controlled micro/nanostructures is challenging. Surface patterns with
aligned magnetic nanoparticles have been demonstrated.31,32 Hybrid patterns with silicon fibers embedded in a hydrogel matrix33,34 and vertically aligned carbon nanotubes embedded in polymeric materials35−37 have also been realized. However, a composite micropillar array
composed of perpendicularly oriented nanofibrils embedded in soft
elastomeric matrix, mimicking the surface design of tree frogs, has
not been realized. This is due, in part, to the difficulty of obtaining
such composite micropillar arrays. Here, we report a fabrication method
to obtain composite surface micropatterns with a soft elastomeric
matrix and perpendicularly oriented polymeric nanopillars with tunable
interfacial interactions, mimicking the toe pad structure of tree
frogs. The composite surface structures are fabricated in a distinct
pattern to realize enhanced adhesion and friction properties in a
single system. Our patterns mimic the geometrical pattern and mechanical
properties of keratinized epithelium of the tree frog’s adhesive
toe pads, but the reported method is generic and flexible and can
be extended to other surface designs and material combinations.

Results
and Discussion
The composite micropatterns consist of arrays
of soft polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) micropillars (Young’s modulus, E ∼
2 MPa) with rigid polystyrene (PS) nanopillars (E ∼ 3 GPa) embedded in the micropillars and oriented perpendicular
to the surface. This hierarchical composite micropattern was obtained via a multistep process (Figure 2, experimental part). First, hexagonal arrays
of cylindrical PS nanopillars with a period of 500 nm, rod diameters
of 330 nm, and a rod height of 10 μm (Figure 3a) were obtained by replicating from anodic
aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes.19 The following
two treatments of the PS nanopillar array are very important to achieve
the designed tree-frog-inspired structure: (1) The surface of PS nanopillars
was modified with vinyl groups in order to covalently link the nanopillars
to the PDMS matrix. (2) The gaps within the PS nanopillar array were
completely filled with PDMS precursor to prevent the possible fusing
of PS nanopillars in the shearing step.

fabrication steps of the composite micropillar
patterns. (a) PS nanopillar array (yellow) that was replicated from
an AAO template; (b) after optional PS surface modification with vinyl

as backing layer; (g) curing of PDMS backing layer and demolding resulted
in composite pillar arrays (blue). One pillar shows the PS nanopillars
inside.

height (hr) of PS nanopillars (red) is

layer.

The PS nanopillar/PDMS precursor
sample was molded under pressure
using a micropatterned Ni mold insert (Figure 3b) with the negative copy of the hexagonal
micropillar pattern. This molding process crushed the PS nanopillars
selectively below the walls of the Ni shim but not within the holes.
In this way, a hexagonal microchannel pattern (channels ca. 5 μm deep and 3 μm wide) was superimposed onto the PS
nanopillar/PDMS liquid array (Figures 3c and S1). The dimensional
size of the PS nanopillar array and the pressure applied on Ni shim
were chosen such that the height of the remaining pillar (hr) is 5 μm (Figure 3d). The bottoms of the channel between the
pillars has a smooth surface, indicating the pressure was large enough
to crush the nanopillars below the walls of the Ni shim; on the other
hand, the standing configuration of remaining PS nanopillars suggests
that the pressure was not too large to destroy the nanopillars within
the holes.

After shearing off the supporting layer of the PS
nanopillar array,
PS nanopillars remained embedded in the PDMS precursor, did not collapse,
and retained a length of ∼5 μm. Only a few nanopillars
at the edges of the microstructures, close to the walls of the Ni
template, deformed during shearing and collapsed with their neighbors
(Figure 3e). The remaining
supporting layer of the nanopillar array also showed a clear micropattern
(Figure 3f), confirming
an effective, clean fracture of the PS nanopillars and the robustness
of the fabrication method. The sample was brought back to room temperature
in a vacuum oven in order to avoid condensation of water on the surface.
PDMS precursor was then added on top of the Ni mold insert and cured
to form a backing layer supporting the composite microstructures.
After curing of the PDMS, the array of composite micropillars on a
PDMS layer was peeled off from the Ni mold. The resulting composite
micropillar array is referred to as Comp+ throughout
this article. For comparison, PS nanopillars without the treatment
of vinyl groups were also embedded into the PDMS matrix by using the
same fabrication process. The composite pillars without the vinyl
group are referred to as Comp in the following text.

Figure 4a,b shows
the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the composite micropillar
array. The pillars have a smooth PDMS top surface. A cross section
of the pillars shows the embedded, standing subsurface nanopillars
in a slightly tilted orientation as a consequence of the shearing
process (Figures 3e
and 4b). Considering the tilted configuration
of the nanopillars, the thickness of the top layer of PDMS (t) on Comp+ was estimated to be ∼100
nm (Figure 4c). Figure 4d shows the dark-field
microscopy image of Comp+ as well as the PDMS micropillar
without embedded PS nanopillars. In the dark-field microscope, the
existence of PS/PDMS interfaces caused the composite pillars Comp+ (left side of Figure 4d) to be brighter than the PDMS pillars without embedded
nanopillars (right side of Figure 4d). These results show that the proposed processing
method allows fabrication of anisotropic, multicomponent micropatterns
with embedded and aligned nanofibers. The method was optimized here
for PDMS/PS material combination and a particular geometry in order
to mimic the properties of tree frog attachment pads. However, the
techniques are not PS- or PDMS-specific and could be extended to other
material types, provided that one material can flow into nanopores
(for the nanofibers) and the other can be cured after the molding
step.

The adhesion and friction behavior of the tree-frog-inspired
composite
micropillar arrays were characterized using a spherical ruby probe
with a diameter of 5 mm.11,12 A typical force–displacement
curve of the adhesion test is shown in Figure 5a, highlighting the value of the pull-off
force (Fad) as a measure of the adhesion
performance. The adhesion forces at different loading forces (1 to
10 mN) were evaluated for the Comp and Comp+ arrays and compared to the arrays of PDMS without embedded nanopillars.12,38 It should be mentioned that there is no liquid added to the contact
interface in all of the tests reported here. In previous work, it
has been shown that the hexagonal design can drain liquid out from
the contact interface and form solid–solid direct contact on
a wet surface where van der Waals forces may contribute mainly to
the adhesion forces.12,13,39 As the current hexagonal pattern design is identical to the previous
one,12 we assume the structure proposed
here will have the same draining effect on a wet surface. Therefore,
the current work focuses on the evaluation of adhesion and friction
on dry surfaces. The experimental results show that the Fad of the Comp+ arrays was significantly
higher than Fad of a PDMS pattern without
the PS reinforcement, whereas Fad on Comp arrays was lower than that of the PDMS pattern (Figure 5b). Both the presence
of the hard subsurface nanopillars and the strength of the interface
between the rods and the PDMS matrix influence adhesion performance.

curve measured on PDMS pillar arrays. Loading force (FL), adhesion force (Fad),
and the pull-off point are indicated. (b) Dependence of Fad on FL measured on PDMS, Comp, and Comp+ micropillar arrays. Each
data point in (b) represents the mean value of three measurements.
Standard deviations are indicated by error bars.

Both the Comp+ and Comp structures
can be considered composite materials. Assuming perfect alignment
of the PS nanopillars in PDMS, the effective elastic modulus of the
composite pillar Ecomp can be estimated
as Ecomp = VPSEPS + VPDMSEPDMS, where V is the
volume fraction for each material and E is the Young’s
modulus. Taking EPS, EPDMS, and VPS to be 3 GPa,
2 MPa, and 0.39, respectively, the estimated Ecomp is 1.2 GPa, which is 500 times higher than EPDMS. In general, a material with smaller E allows greater conformation to the contact surface and therefore
can result in stronger adhesion.40 Biological
systems bearing adhesive toe pads, like geckos and tree frogs, employ
hierarchical structures to reduce apparent E and
to enhance adhesion. For example, the gecko setae is composed of a
hard material (β-keratin) with an E of 2–4
GPa, whereas the apparent E of the seta array is
only around 100 kPa.41 However, both enhanced
and slightly reduced adhesions were found in the composite pillars
(Comp+ and Comp) with larger apparent E as compared to the PDMS micropillars. Obviously, the simplistic
argument in terms of the effective stiffness of the composite materials
does not apply to our case. On the other hand, it is also quite clear
that the rigid PS nanopillars in the PDMS matrix play a critical role
in determining the adhesion performance of the composite pillars.

The stress distribution at the contact interface, which is influenced
by both the tip geometry of pillars and the elastic heterogeneity
of the bodies in contact, is critical to understand the adhesion enhancement
observed in the Comp+ samples. From studies related
to gecko adhesion, it is known that mushroom-shaped tips on micro-
and nanopillars alter the stress distribution and result in a maximum
stress at the contact center, and that the stress decreases smoothly
out to the contact perimeter.42,43 In general, it is more
difficult to initiate a crack at the center than at the edge of a
contact. Furthermore, the crack initiation on the pillar will start
from the contact center and propagate toward the edge of the mushroom
tip, which could introduce a vacuum pressure contribution to the pull-off
force.44 Therefore, these two effects (i.e., the crack initiation from a stress center and the
vacuum pressure) result in a large pull-off force (adhesion force).
In contrast, the crack initiation on a simple cylindrical micropillar
without an overhang structure happens at the pillar edge, where the
maximum stress is located. A stress distribution with a high stress
at the center relative to the edge has also been realized in the millimeter
and sub-millimeter composite pillars that are composed of a stiff
core (Ecore > 3 GPa) and a thin shell
of PDMS, without the overhang structure.45,46 As the thickness of the PDMS layer on top of the stiff core is decreased,
the maximum stress shifts to the center and the detachment force increases.45

Considering the strong interfacial bonding
between the PS nanopillars
and PDMS matrix (Comp+) in the structures investigated
here, the PS/PDMS composite effectively acts as a stiff core, similar
to the previous work discussed above. However, the discrete nature
of the PS nanopillars may affect the stress distribution, thus we
investigated our structure using finite element analysis (Figure 6). Due to the symmetric
nature of the micropillars here, 1/6 of the micropillar (in the shape
of equilateral triangle) was simulated (Figure S2a) in the primary simulation. In a separate simulation, a
representative cell containing two quarters of PS nanopillars and
the matrix (Figure S2b) was also simulated.
The models were 3D and included the thickness of the PDMS layer (t) on top of the PS nanopillar, which was estimated to be
around t = 100 nm (Figure 4c). All of the simulation results here are
presented in terms of the local normal stress at the interface divided
by the average normal stress at the interface. From the representative
cell simulations (the black line represents the perimeter of the PS
nanopillars), a local stress maximum is found to be located at the
center of nanopillars (Figure 6a). The maximum normalized stress is 1.39, and the stress
decreases smoothly toward the nanopillar perimeter. It should be noted
that the normalized stress at the nanopillar perimeter is between
1.10 and 1.16 and decays further beyond the area of the nanopillar.
It suggests that the strong interfacial bonding effectively transmits
stress between the PS nanopillar and the PDMS matrix.

Figure 6 Simulated stress distribution
on Comp+ micropillars
during detachment. (a) Representative cell of the composite pillar
containing two quarters PS nanopillars. The black line indicates the
edge of PS nanopillar. Stress distribution on the (b) Comp+ and (c) Comp micropillar. The insets in (b,c)
are the zoomed-in views of the corresponding area in the dashed boxes
in (b,c).

The stress distribution across
the entire hexagonal composite pillar
is quite complex (Figure 6b). Globally, the stress distribution appears quite homogeneous,
especially in the central region. In the central region, the stress
is locally high above the nanopillars and then decays in the area
between the nanopillars, just as that in the representative cell.
However, the global stress minimum (0.34) is found at the edge of
the hexagonal composite pillar (at the bottom edge of the triangle
in the 1/6 model, inset in Figure 6b). The maximum stress (1.99) is located on one to
two rows of PS nanopillars and is just some distance away from the
region where the stress minimum is located. It should be emphasized
that the stress maximum is not at the edge of the micropillar. Furthermore,
the stress maximum on the composite pillar is much smaller than the
maximum normalized stress predicted along the edge of the pure hexagonal
PDMS micropillar (2.58) (Figure S2c). This
result clearly demonstrates that the presence of rigid nanopillars
embedded in soft micropillar can both (1) reduce the value of stress
maximum and (2) shift the stress maximum toward the central region
(Figure 6b). It suggests
that this kind of composite design in tree frogs may have a similar
function to the overhang structures at the tip of seta in various
animals bearing fibrillar adhesives.

When the interfacial bonding
between the PS nanopillars and the
PDMS matrix (Comp) is weak, the stress distribution
is significantly different than that observed for Comp+ (Figure 6c). As
there is no strong chemical bonding between PS nanopillars and the
PDMS matrix, the stress from the PDMS region, which directly contacts
the contacting surface, could not effectively transmit to the embedded
PS nanopillars. Therefore, the regions with lowest stress are located
on top of the nanopillars. The stress within the PDMS matrix is rather
homogeneous and just slightly higher than the stress minimum. The
stress maximum is located at the micropillar edge within the PDMS
area (inset in Figure 6c). Furthermore, the normalized stress reaches a maximum of 4.93,
much higher than that of the pure PDMS pillar. This may explain why
the Comp pillars have lower adhesion than the pure
PDMS pillars (Figure 5b).

Once a crack initiates at the location of the maximum stress,
the
crack will propagate and be affected by the nonuniform stress distribution
and elastic heterogeneity. The staggered arrangement of the PS nanopillars
can further hinder the propagation of the crack front (green line
in Figure 7a). The
detaching part of the pull-off curve confirmed this discontinuity
of crack propagation (Figure 7b). The detachment curve on Comp+ showed
a stepwise profile with periodic spacing between steps of 114.7 ±
3.8 nm, which corresponds to the shortest distance between rows of
PS nanopillars of d = 103 nm (Figure 7a). In contrast, the retract curve on the
pure PDMS pillar has a smooth profile.

Figure 7 Detachment behavior and
the structure stability. (a) Proposed movement
of crack front during the detachment. The solid green line indicates
the crack front; the dashed green line indicates the crack front at
the next row of PS nanopillars; the green arrows indicate the moving
direction of the crack front. (b) Fraction of the detachment curve
after the pull-off point on Comp+ and PDMS micropillar
arrays. (c) Repeated adhesion tests on Comp+, Comp, and PDMS micropillar arrays.

This phenomenon is similar to the detachment of an adhesive
layer
with subsurface microchannels filled with different liquids.47,48 The crack front does not propagate continuously at the interface.
The crack is arrested close to the location with minimum modulus and
only initiates again at larger peel-off force. The discontinuous crack
propagation therefore results in a higher adhesion compared to a uniform
material. In previous work,47,48 modulation of the stiffness
of the PDMS was achieved by filling the buried microchannels with
a fluid (air or liquid), which cannot very well sustain stresses.
In our case, the second component (PS nanopillar) is a hard solid
and links to the PDMS matrix via chemical bonding,
which can transfer the stress as demonstrated by finite element analysis
(Figure 6a). Furthermore,
no obvious change in interfacial interaction and a high efficiency
of deformation across the interface between two materials can be concluded
from the 100 cycles of attachment/detachment at the same location
because the adhesion performance kept constant (Figure 7c).

Figure 8a shows
the friction curve measured on the composite structure of Comp+.12,28,29 The friction forces of the PDMS pillars show a linear dependence
on the normal loading force and a friction coefficient of ∼0.89.
The friction performance on composite pillar Comp was identical to that on the PDMS micropillar surface (Figure 8b). However, Comp+ micropatterns showed significantly higher friction.
Under a normal load of 1 mN, Comp+ showed a 88% friction
enhancement. During friction, the micropillars tilt and elongate along
the shear direction. The deformation of the PDMS pillar and the adhesion
force between the pillar and the probe contribute to the friction
force. The shearing force of one pillar, Fshear, can be estimated by Fshear= GAΔx/h, where G, A, h, and Δx are the shear modulus, the area of the pillar top, the
height of the pillar, and the transverse displacement of the pillar
along the shear direction, respectively.49 The sum of Δx of the pillars in contact is
the displacement at which static friction changes to kinetic friction
in the friction curves, Ds (Figure 8a). Therefore, the apparent Fshear can be estimated from Fshear ∼ nGADs/h, where n is the number of pillars in
contact. The stronger adhesion on Comp+ micropatterns
leads to larger lateral displacement needed to initiate the detachment
of the pillar edge at the shearing front. In fact, Ds on Comp+ doubles that on the pure PDMS
pillar (Figure 8c). Comp+ micropatterns also show higher shear stiffness, which
may facilitate transfer of shear stress to the PDMS backing layer,
which can ultimately result in a larger deformed volume and increased
dissipation. Both factors together resulted in a larger friction force
for our composite patterns.

friction
curve measured on PDMS arrays. The friction force (Ff) in trace and retrace directions and the transition
distance from static to dynamic friction, Ds, are indicated. (b) Dependence of Ff on FL on Comp+, Comp, and PDMS micropillar arrays. (c) Ds measured on Comp+ and PDMS micropillar
arrays. Each data point in (b,c) represents the mean value of three
measurements. Standard deviations are indicated.

In order to verify the importance of the freestanding, embedded
nanopillars for the enhanced adhesion and friction performance on Comp+ patterns, two control experiments were carried out:
one on a flat composite structure consisting of a PDMS film with an
embedded PS sheet, and one on a microstructured PDMS with embedded
nanofibers linked to their stiff PS backing layer (Figure S3). The friction experiment on the flat PDMS film
with the embedded PS sheet caused significant damage of the PDMS surface
(Figure S3a). The friction curve showed
a large static friction force, followed by a drop in friction after
surface damage (Figure S3b), and a weaker
dynamic friction associated with the pushing of the PDMS layer along
the rigid PS layer (Figure S3a). The friction
damage was partially reduced when the PS film was covalently bound
to the PDMS (Figure S3c). When embedded
nanopillars were connected to the PS backing layer, damage of the
top PDMS layer was also observed, in contrast to the stability of Comp+ micropatterns, where the PS nanopillars were not connected
to a stiff backing layer (Figure S3d).
The presence of a rigid, continuous layer underneath the soft PDMS
top layer will lead to highly localized stresses that result in damage
of the top layer. Thus, our Comp+ structures offer
a combination of several mechanical properties: (i) modulation of
the local effective Young’s modulus due to the stiffness contrast
between PDMS and PS leading to improved adhesion by crack arrest;
(ii) homogeneous distribution of the stress on the pillar top and
efficient transfer of stress from the pillar top to the backing PDMS
layers; and (iii) the delicate balance between lateral bending stiffness
of the pillars and flexibility of the top PDMS layer to increase compliance
to a counterpart surface.

Conclusions
We developed a method
to fabricate composite micropillar patterns
reinforced with hard, rootless nanopillars. We applied our approach
to the PDMS/PS system in order to mimic the design of tree frog’s
adhesive toe pads. However, the method could be extended to other
polymers or material combinations. Enhanced adhesion and friction
were found on composite pillar arrays Comp+, where
the PS nanopillars and the PDMS were covalently linked, allowing transmission
of mechanical stress and deformation. These results suggest that the
hierarchical structure found in the surface of tree frog attachment
pads is beneficial for both adhesion and friction and possibly required
for tree frog’s survival. Combining the composite design of
the microstructure and the presence of liquid at the contact interface
may deepen our understanding of the adhesion abilities of tree frogs,
which will come in a subsequent paper. The results here also provide
insight for the design of bioinspired materials with both strong adhesion
and friction based on composite structures without the complicated
fiber geometries typically used in gecko-inspired dry adhesives.

Experimental Section
Materials
Polydimethylsiloxane
elastomer kits (Sylgard
184) were purchased from Dow Corning (MI, USA). Polystyrene (Mw = 35 kg mol–1; PDI = 1.04)
and vinyltriethoxylsilane (analytical grade) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
were used as received. Self-ordered AAO templates were fabricated
by two-step mild anodization with phosphoric acid as electrolyte.50 The as-prepared AAO templates had a pore diameter
of ∼180 nm, a lattice period of ∼500 nm, a pore depth
of 10 μm, and a round area with a diameter of 15 mm. The pores
were widened in 10% phosphoric acid at 30 °C for 65 min. The
widened AAO templates were washed and dried in vacuum.

Equipment
Surface microstructures were characterized
by white light confocal microscopy (μsurf, Nanofocus AG, Oberhausen,
Germany) and scanning electron microscopy (LEO 1530VP Gemini; Carl
Zeiss Jena, Oberkochen, Germany). The surface modification was carried
out on a Plasma Activate Statuo 10 USB (Plasma Technology GmbH, Rottenburg,
Germany).

Fabrication of the Microstructured Nickel Mold Inserts
For the mold insert fabrication, a Cr/Au metallized 2 in. silicon
wafer (which contains an etched pattern field of 10 × 10 mm2) was used as master. The Si master was fixed on a poly(methyl
methacrylate) sheet by adhesive tape and contacted by a copper wire.
Nickel electroforming was carried out in a boric acid containing nickel
sulfamate electrolyte (pH 3.4–3.6 at 52 °C) for approximately
48 h. To ensure a slow growth of the nickel layer at the beginning
and to achieve a defect-free galvanic filling of the microstructures,
the current density was adjusted to 0.1 A/dm2 (corresponding
to a growth speed of approximately 0.02 μm/min) at the start
of the plating process. After every 30 min, the current density was
increased from 0.1 up to 1.5 A/dm2 (approximately 0.3 μm/min).
If the desired metal thickness (500 μm) was reached, the silicon
wafer with the thick nickel layer was dismounted and the silicon wafer
was removed by wet-chemical dissolving using 30% KOH. After a plasma
stripping and final cleaning procedure with isopropyl alcohol shaking
for 10 min, the mold insert was usable for further SEM characterization
(Figure S4). The dimensions of the hexagonal
holes (and therefore the replicated micropillars) were 20 μm
in diameter (D), 5 μm in height (H), and 3 μm in gap width (W) between the pillars
following the design of a frog’s adhesive toe pad.11,12

Preparation of the PS Nanopillar Array
The preparation
of the PS nanopillar array followed the procedure previously reported
elsewhere.19 In a typical procedure, the
PS film was placed on AAO (Figure S5) and
heated to 200 °C for 3 h under vacuum while a pressure of about
160 bar was applied. Aluminum layer in AAO template was dissolved
by immersion in a solution of 100 mL of 37% HCl and 3.4 g of CuCl2·2H2O in 100 mL of deionized water at 0 °C.
After the removal of the aluminum layer, the alumina layer was etched
away in 1 M aqueous NaOH solution at room temperature for 1 h, and
the NaOH solution was replaced with a fresh one for another 1 h. The
PS sample was then dried in a freeze-dryer to avoid collapse of the
nanopillars by capillary forces during drying (Figure 2a). A typical PS nanopillar array has a dimension
of 5 × 5 mm2.

Surface Modification of
the Nanopillar Array
The PS
nanopillar film was adhered to a PS plate with superglue. PS nanopillars
were treated with oxygen plasma with 100 W, 0.1 mbar for 30 s. The
treated PS nanopillars were immersed in solution of vinyltriethoxylsilane
dispersed in mixed NH3/H2O/ethanol for 30 min.
The treated sample was freeze-dried.

Removal of the Supporting
Layer of the PS Nanopillar Array
Approximately 10 μL
of PDMS precursor was casted on the vinyl-modified
PS nanopillar array (Figure 2b). The thickness of the PDMS layer was just enough to cover
the PS nanopillars. The PS nanopillar arrays were brought into contact
with the nickel mold insert (Figure 2c). The assembly of the PS nanopillar array and the
nickel insert was mounted on the cantilever of a homemade shearing
device with strong magnets, as shown in Figure S3. An extra pressure was added to the magnets for 1 min. The
assembly of the PS nanopillar array/Ni shim was then immersed into
liquid nitrogen for ca. 30 s for deep-freezing (Figure 2d). At this temperature,
the PDMS precursor becomes glassy and the PS nanopillars are brittle.
By rotating the screw on the lower manipulator (Figure S6a), the upper manipulator was moved rightward to
apply a shear force on the PS substrate (Figures 2e and S6b). A
moving distance of around 5 mm allows PS nanopillars (remaining in
Ni mold) to be completely sheared off from the PS backing layer. The
whole device was then heated up to room temperature in a vacuum oven.
Afterward, the PS plate with the supporting layer was removed, and
the PS nanopillars embedded in PDMS remained in the nickel mold insert.

Preparation of Composite Pillars
PDMS precursor was
cast onto the nickel insert and left at room temperature for 30 min
to form a backing layer (Figure 2f). This period had two functions: (1) allowing the
PDMS precursor to fill any remaining voids inside the nanopillar array
in the nickel insert; (2) leveling off the free surface of the PDMS
backing layer. The sample was then heated to 60 °C for 4 h. The
composite pillar was then ready to peel off from the nickel insert
(Figure 2g) and is
denoted as Comp+ throughout the paper. For the comparison,
composite pillars composed of PDMS matrix and embedded PS nanopillars
without the treatment of vinyl groups were also fabricated with the
same dimensions and curing history, which are referred to as Comp.

Preparation of Pillar Arrays with PDMS
The thermal
treatment for curing PDMS was the same for both Comp+ and Comp.

Adhesion and Friction Tests
Adhesion
and friction tests
were all carried out on a homemade device (PIA) as shown in our previous
work.11,12,28 In brief,
a spherical ruby probe of 5 mm in diameter is connected to the upper
force sensor, which controls the loading forces in adhesion and friction
tests. The sample was mounted on the lower sensor, which records the
lateral friction force. All the tests were performed in ambient conditions
without any liquid at the contacting interface. In adhesion tests,
the sample surface approached the probe at a speed of 20 μm/s
until a predefined loading force was reached. The sample was then
retracted at the same speed. The adhesion force corresponds to the
value of the force at the pull-off event.

In friction tests,
the probe was brought into contact with the sample surface and a normal
force was applied and kept constant during lateral shearing. The sample
was moved at a velocity of 100 μm/s over a distance of 500 μm,
forward and backward, while the forces were simultaneously recorded.
