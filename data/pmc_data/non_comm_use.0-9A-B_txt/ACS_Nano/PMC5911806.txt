Graphene-based
wearable e-textiles are considered to be promising
due to their advantages over traditional metal-based technology. However,
the manufacturing process is complex and currently not suitable for
industrial scale application. Here we report a simple, scalable, and
cost-effective method of producing graphene-based wearable e-textiles
through the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to make stable
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) dispersion which can then be applied
to the textile fabric using a simple pad-dry technique. This application
method allows the potential manufacture of conductive graphene e-textiles
at commercial production rates of ∼150 m/min. The graphene
e-textile materials produced are durable and washable with acceptable
softness/hand feel. The rGO coating enhanced the tensile strength
of cotton fabric and also the flexibility due to the increase in
strain% at maximum load. We demonstrate the potential application
of these graphene e-textiles for wearable electronics with activity
monitoring sensor. This could potentially lead to a multifunctional
single graphene e-textile garment that can act both as sensors and
flexible heating elements powered by the energy stored in graphene
textile supercapacitors.

Multifunctional
wearable e-textiles
are becoming increasingly popular since such technology makes life
safer, healthier, and more comfortable.1 This technology allows the production of highly innovative and intelligent
e-textile garments that can perform as a sensor, actuator, power generator,
and energy storage device all at the same time.2 The market for such e-textiles has been growing rapidly
and is forecasted to grow up to USD 5 billion by 2027 through the
integration of lightweight and flexible electronics into everyday
garment.3 However, the challenge to achieving
this goal lies within the complex and time-consuming manufacturing
process of e-textiles and the use of expensive,4 toxic,5 and nonbiodegradable,6 not very stable metallic conductive materials
such as silver (Ag) and copper (Cu).

Graphene has opened up
a wide range of flexible electronics applications
due to its outstanding electrical, mechanical, and other performance
properties.7−9 The unique properties of graphene are mostly associated
with the individual sheets.7 Therefore,
it is important for industrial applications that bulk amounts of graphene
can be produced in a processable form that does not agglomerate. However,
graphene sheets, unless well separated from each other, have a tendency
to agglomerate and even restack to form graphite through van der Waals
interactions.10 The graphite oxide route
is currently the most popular wet chemical method for producing scalable
quantities of graphene materials such as graphene oxide (GO)11 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO).12 This is because of its higher yield, good colloidal
stability, and excellent dispersibility in various solvents.13−15

Graphene-based materials, such as GO and rGO, have already
shown
great promise by being fabricated into environmental friendly wearable
e-textiles.16−21 The presence of the negative charge in GO not only helps to form
stable dispersions14 but also allows their
interaction with the functional groups of the fibers/fabrics.20,22 Thus, it provides better fixation with textile fabrics and produces
flexible, washable and durable wearable e-textiles. Several techniques
have been used to coat textiles with graphene materials such as dip
coating,23 vacuum filtration,24 brush coating,25 direct
electrochemical deposition,26 electrophoresis,27 kinetic trapping method,28 wet transfer of monolayer,29 or screen printing.30 However, these
are time-consuming and multi-stage manufacturing processes; not suitable
for large-scale production. Therefore, there is a need for a low-cost,
continuous, and scalable process for fabricating commercial wearable
e-textiles.

The traditional method of coating textiles with
rGO usually goes via coating textiles with GO first,
followed by subsequent
reduction by partial restoration of the sp2 structure.31 This can be achieved by chemical,23 thermal,32 or electrochemical
reduction17 methods. Thermal reduction
of GO coated textiles has also been reported;19 however the textile fabrics are temperature sensitive and lose strength
significantly at higher temperature.33 The
electrochemical reduction requires conductive substrates to carry
current flow, which is suitable for carbon cloths only. The majority
of graphene e-textiles studies concentrate on chemical reductants
such as ascorbic acid,18 hydrazine,27 hydroiodic acid,34 sodium borohydride,23 and sodium hydrosulphite22 in the post-treatment process, where GO coated
fabrics are reduced to electrically conductive rGO e-textiles. However,
most of these reducing agents are toxic and may not be suitable for
e-textiles application which would be in contact with human body.
The other potential reducing agents are either not very efficient
or require longer processing time to reduce the GO.35 Recently, Shateri-Khalilabad et al.23 reported using of Na2S2O4 as an efficient reducing agent to reduce GO coated
textiles. However, their process involves multiple “dip and
dry” coating with GO and post-reduction with Na2S2O4, which is time-consuming and requires
a number of cleaning steps. Therefore, it is desirable to have an
efficient and scalable reduction process for manufacturing rGO-based
wearable e-textiles.

Here we report a simple, scalable, and
cost-effective method of
producing graphene-based e-textiles. In contrast with previous approaches,
we reduce GO in solution, chemically functionalize it, and use the
resulting functionalized rGO to coat the textiles. As illustrated
in Figure 1, we use
a modified Hummers method first to synthesize GO and then chemically
reduce this in situ using Na2S2O4, an efficient and commercially available reducing agent
for textile materials. During in situ chemical reduction
of GO, we also incorporate poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) in order to
functionalize the surface of rGO to form a stable dispersion. We use
this rGO dispersion to coat textile fabrics using a simple and continuous
pad-dry process and also demonstrate the application of these graphene
e-textiles via associated activity monitoring sensor.

Results and Discussion
Scalable
Production of Stable rGO Dispersion and Characterization
We synthesized GO using a simple and cheap solution process, that
is, a modified Hummers method.36,37 In this process, the
oxidative intercalation and production of oxygen-containing functional
groups on the graphene layers helps to disperse and stabilize GO sheet
in an aqueous medium.38 As prepared, GO
was chemically reduced to rGO using sodium hydrosulphite (Na2S2O4) as the reducing agent. Na2S2O4 is widely used in the textile industry
for efficient, reliable, and rapid reduction of vat dyes in order
to solubilize the pigment molecule.39 The
structure of GO is similar to that of vat dyes used in the textile
industry (Figure S1, Supporting Information),
as oxygen functional groups are covalently attached to their aromatic
benzene rings.40 With the addition of Na2S2O4 to the yellow-brown dispersion
of GO, the color of the dispersion turns opaque black almost immediately
(Figure S2, Supporting Information), which
confirms the efficient reduction of GO. This is in agreement with
previous studies,40,41 where a change of color was observed
within 15–20 min. As dye reduction with Na2S2O4 has already been commercially used for many
years in the textile industry, we therefore believe it has significant
commercial potential to be used for stable rGO dispersion production.

Shateri-Khalilabad et al.23 used a number of reducing agents such as NaBH4, N2H4, C6H8O6, Na2S2O4, and NaOH to reduce GO coated fabrics.
However, they found that Na2S2O4 was
the best reducing agent to achieve higher electrical conductivity
in the e-textiles. Zhou et al.40 explained the reduction mechanism of Na2S2O4 which has a low electrode potential (E° SO32–/S2O42– = −1.12 V) in alkaline conditions
and dissociates two protons to become a nucleophile. This nucleophile
attacks the epoxide and hydroxyl groups of GO with a back side SN2 nucleophilic reaction to form an intermediate. Reduced graphene
oxide is formed due to hydro-thermal reduction, and the reducing agent
(S2O42–) is oxidized to sulphite
(SO32–).

Although the reduction
of graphene oxide is a popular approach,
the major problem associated with this route is that rGO aggregates
in aqueous solution due to its hydrophobic nature, especially at higher
concentration. To prevent restacking of graphene flakes, surface characteristics
should be modified by the addition of surface functionality through
either covalent bonding or noncovalent interactions.42,43 Covalent bonding is commonly preferred when stability and strong
mechanical properties of modified graphene are required. In this study,
we functionalized the rGO surface using poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS),
which improved the dispersibility and stability of the rGO in aqueous
media.44 The dispersion (3.2 mg/mL) was
stable for more than 6 months, and moreover, the PSS functionalized
rGO dispersion offers better wettability45 and enables better adhesion to the fibrous substrates.

Field
emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM) was used
to assess the lateral size of precursor GO and resultant rGO composite
ink. Figure 2a shows
a statistical analysis of 100 flakes where the mean lateral dimension
of GO was 5.85 μm and that of rGO was 4.86 μm. The decreased
flake size of GO after reduction may be due to the stresses it was
subjected to during pre-mixing and centrifugation steps in post-washing
cycles. Figure 2b shows
flake thickness (h) of GO and rGO, which was 2.07
nm for GO and 2.21 nm for rGO. Figure 2b indicates that the distribution was shifted toward
higher h for rGO, which may be due the presence of
cross-linking polymer (PSS) covering the graphene flake.44

(d) Raman spectra of GO and rGO.

XPS analysis provides further evidence of efficient reduction
by
Na2S2O4, Figure 2c, as the wide scan XPS spectrum shows a
significant increase in carbon content after reduction. The C/O ratio
was also increased from 2.4 (GO) to 6.6 (rGO) after reduction (Table 1). Moreover the C(1s)
spectra of GO and rGO (Figure S3) demonstrates
that the peaks associated with oxygen functional groups46 sharply diminished after GO reduction to rGO,
with a small amount of residual oxygen functionality evident at 286.5
eV. The C(1s) spectrum of rGO was almost identical to graphite or
graphene, which exhibited clear restoration of graphitic structure
through chemical reduction.47Figure 2d shows the Raman
spectra of GO and rGO which display characteristic D and G peaks.
After reduction, the intensity ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) was increased from 0.98
for GO to 1.61 for rGO.

Scalable Production of Graphene E-Textiles
Padding
is the most commonly used method in the textile industry to apply
functional (e.g., water repellent,
wrinkle free, moisture management, etc.) or soft
finishes onto textiles. The production speed of a pad-dry unit is
high and can potentially process approximately 150 m fabric in just
1 min. In this study, a laboratory scale pad-dry unit was used to
mimic an industrial pad-dry unit, which could potentially be used
for large-scale industrial production of graphene e-textiles. Figure 3a,d shows a white
cotton control fabric which was de-sized, scoured, and bleached to
remove natural and added impurities and colors.48 As shown in Figure 3a, this control fabric was passed through the padding bath
which contains the rGO dispersion (3.2 mg/mL), and the mangle nip
rollers squeeze any excess rGO from the fabric surface, thus producing
a uniform treatment. Almost immediately after coating (within few
seconds), the white cotton fabrics turns black as shown in Figure 3b, due to the uniform
deposition of rGO on the surface (Figure 3h) and also within each individual fiber.
The rGO coated fabric was dried at 100 °C for 5 min in a Mathis
laboratory dryer to dry off the water/solvent and fix the graphene
onto the textiles.

bath and
rollers. (b) rGO coated cotton fabric immediately after padding. (c)

(×1000). (h) SEM image of rGO coated cotton fabric (×1000).
(i) SEM image of washed (five times) rGO coated cotton fabric (×1000).

Figure 3d,e shows
untreated and rGO padded (five passes) cotton fabrics, respectively. Figure 3f demonstrates the
excellent bendability and flexibility of the rGO padded cotton fabrics,
which is similar to untreated cotton fabrics. The rGO coating on cotton
fabric has not altered the “drape” (the way a fabric
hangs under its own weight) of the fabrics. SEM images of the untreated
cotton fabric, Figure 3g, show a typically smooth fiber, which clearly changed the morphology
after deposition of the rGO flakes on the cotton fiber surface (Figure 3h). Unlike in the
previously reported study where rGO was deposited between the fibers,19 in this study the rGO forms a uniform coating
around the fibers. This is may be due to the smooth coating by padding
and the hydrogen bonding between residual hydroxyl groups of rGO and
cotton fibers.20,21 Therefore, rGO coated fabrics
provide electric conductivity without compromising the breathability,
flexibility, and comfort of the wearable e-textiles. Figure 3h also shows some inter-fiber
bonding between adjacent fibers, which may be due to the presence
of the PSS cross-linker in the rGO dispersion. Figure 3i shows SEM images of washed (five times)
rGO coated fabric, which appear almost unchanged even after the repeated
washing cycles.

XPS analysis of the untreated and rGO coated
cotton fabrics provides
further evidence of efficient coating of rGO on the cotton fibers
(Figure 4a,b and Table 1). The wide scan XPS
analysis shows an increase in carbon content from 73.9% for untreated
cotton to 82.4% for rGO coated cotton (one pass) and a decrease in
oxygen content from 26.1% for untreated cotton to 17.6% rGO coated
cotton (one padding pass) (Table 1). Moreover, the C/O ratio increased from 2.8 for untreated
cotton to 4.7 for treated cotton (one padding pass). In addition,
with the increase of number of padding passes, the C/O ratio increased
to 6.1 (for five padding passes). This was clearly due to the presence
of more rGO flakes on the fiber surface at the higher number of padding
passes. The C (1s) spectrum of untreated cotton fabric in Figure 4a shows three main
peaks that can be fitted into three components arising from C–C
bond (∼284.6 eV), C–O groups (hydroxyl, ∼286.2
eV), and C=O/O–C–O groups (carbonyl and acetal,
∼288 eV).49 After coating with rGO,
the peaks associated with the oxygen functional groups significantly
diminished with small amounts of residual oxygen functional groups
left around 287.5 eV (Figure 4b).

(c) Sheet resistance vs number of padding passes.
(d) The change of sheet resistance with number of washing cycles.

Figure 4c shows
the changes of sheet resistance of the rGO coated fabric with the
number of padding passes. After one padding pass with rGO, the sheet
resistance of coated fabric was 361.82 kΩ/sq. There was a slight
change in the sheet resistance of rGO coated cotton fabric up to two
padding cycles. However, the sheet resistance then decreased sharply
by ∼50–60% for each padding pass up to five padding
passes. The sheet resistance of the rGO coated fabric decreased by
∼90% from 348.34 kΩ/sq (after two padding passes) to
36.94 kΩ/sq (after five padding passes). This could possibly
be explained by an absorption and adsorption phenomena, where absorption
of rGO dispersion into the fibers is pre-dominant in first few padding
passes. Once it reached the saturation point, it is then mainly adsorbed
on the fiber surface and formed a continuous conductive film by creating
better connections between flakes. Thus, the sheet resistance of the
fabric decreased by presenting more flakes on fiber surface (Figure 3h) and by the restacking
of the flakes through the van der Waal forces applied by the squeeze
rollers.

Figure 4d shows
the washability of the rGO coated fabric (five padding passes) after
a number of washing cycles (1–10). The simulated standard washing
conditions generated mechanical agitation and abrasion of the rGO
coated fabric in the washing bath, which altered the continuity of
conductive film on the fabric surfaces, resulting in an increase in
sheet resistance.19 The sheet resistance
of rGO coated fabric increased significantly from 36.94 kΩ/sq
to 70.32 kΩ/sq after the first washing cycle, probably be due
to the removal of unfixed rGO flakes from the fabric surface. After
that, the sheet resistance increased moderately to 139.09 kΩ/sq
after 10 washing cycles. We also examined various humidity conditions
to observe its effect on the rGO coated cotton e-textiles; however,
the complex impedance spectra (CIS) and I–V curves (Figure S4a,b) showed
that humidity had no effect on the impedance and resistance of rGO
coated textiles, which may be due to the efficient reduction and hydrophobicity
of the rGO.50 Almost similar graphs were
observed for rGO coated cotton fabrics (with five padding passes)
at 11%, 53%, and 97% relative humidity.

The tensile strength
of textile fabrics is one of the most important
parameters that determines the quality and lifetime of a garment.
Some of the chemical processing of cotton or cellulosic fibers seem
to have significant negative effects on their tensile strength due
to the damage in cellulosic structure.51 Moreover, the higher curing temperature (above 140 °C) for
longer duration reduced the cotton fabric strength significantly due
to the intra-macromolecular cross-linking and depolymerization of
the cellulose.33 However, these issues
were not addressed in previous studies on graphene-based e-textiles,
where the toxic reducing agents such as hydrazine hydrate27 and a higher thermal reduction temperature for
longer duration19 were used in the post-reduction
process of GO coated textiles. Nevertheless, the lower or similar
tensile strength achieved with chemically reduced GO coated textiles
was reported to some extent.23 In contrast,
we use an efficient and commonly used chemical (Na2S2O4) for textiles processing as the reducing agent
and the relatively lower temperature (100 °C) for shorter duration
(5 min) in our study. Figure 5a shows a significant increase in the tensile strength in
both the warp and weft direction of the rGO coated cotton fabrics
by ∼20%–30% after a single padding pass, almost similar
to pigment-dyed cotton fabrics and by ∼60% after five padding
passes. Similarly, the elongation or strain% at maximum load increased
with rGO coatings showing enhancement in flexibility (displacement).52 These results are in agreement with previous
studies, however, on rGO-based composites.53

Figure 5 Effect
of rGO coatings and pigment dyeing on (a) Tensile strength
at maximum load and (b) Strain% at maximum load. (c) Shear rigidity, G, and (d) Shear hysteresis at 5°, 2HG5, of cotton fabrics.

The Kawabata evaluation system for fabrics (KES-F) is an
objective
measurement system based on tensile, shear, bending compression and
surface analysis intruments that measure 16 mechanical parameters
using non-destructive forces similar to those used by a human hand
during typical fabric assessment and can characterize the fabric handle
qualities (e.g., softness or stiffness,
smoothness, etc.) perceived by human touch.54 In this study, the shear rigidity, G, and shear hysteresis, 2HG5, of the rGO coated
cotton fabrics (Figure 5c,d) were measured, and it was found that the shear rigidity decreased
after coating with rGO. While in contrast, the shear rigidity increased
for the pigment-dyed fabrics due to the introduction of inter-fiber
bonding by the cross-linking binder, which resulted in a stiffer and
harsher hand feel.55 The shear hysteresis
at 5°, 2HG5, has previously been identified
as the “best” indicator relating to subjective perception
of fabric softness and is a sensitive measure of inter-yarn friction.56 If a processing treatment lubricates the fiber/yarn
surface, such as a fabric softener, the 2HG5 value
decreases, while if the treatment roughens/degrades, the surface 2HG5 increases. In this case, the 2HG5 value
decreased with rGO coating, suggesting there was no formation of “restricting”
inter-fiber bonds, but rather the rGO coating lubricates the fiber
surfaces and results in an overall improvement in the fabric softness.
In contrast, for pigment-dyed fabric the introduction of inter-fiber
bonding in the fabric structure resulted in a stiffening/harshening
of the fabric handle, and this was reflected in the much higher 2HG5 values observed (Figure 5d).

Wearable Sensor Application
Figure 6a shows the changes
in resistances per total
length of the rGO coated fabric at various bending positions with
concave down at various cord lengths (Figure S8) when the test is carried out on a tensile tester. Here, the cord
length is defined as the distance between the tensile tester grips
for the sensor material under investigation. As seen in Figure 6a, a repeatable response in
forward (bending) and reverse (bending back) directions was observed.57 Similarly for compression with concave upward
position, the change in resistance of the rGO coated cotton fabrics
was repeatable in both the forward (compression) and reverse (compression
back) directions (Figure 6b). Unlike in other studies, where the change in resistance
of the coated or printed fabrics with bending (increase) and compression
(decrease) was the opposite,19,58 here in both cases
the resistance of the rGO coated fabric increased with the increase
of cord length for bending and compression. This may be due to the
fact that individual cotton fibers were uniformly coated with rGO
during padding on both sides of the fabric and still maintained the
same porosity of cotton woven fabric. Moreover, strong connectivity
between the flakes was achieved due to the pressure applied by padding
rollers. Thus produced rGO coated fabric would provide better comfort
and breathability to users. However, the change in resistance (ΔR/R0) varied during bending
and compression may be due to the different structure on the front
and back side of the fabric.

sensor in forward

reverse (compression back) direction. (c) The upward and downward
movements of rGO coated cotton fabric mounted on a wrist joint. (d)
Expanded version of purple box in (c) from 57 s to 77 s.

In order to investigate the suitability of the
rGO coated fabrics
to be used as an activity monitoring sensor, for example, wrist movement
monitoring, a piece of rGO coated (five padding passes) fabric was
mounted on a wrist joint, Figure 6c, and the change in resistance per 8 cm length of
the rGO coated fabric was continuously recorded during the wrist movement
(i.e., when the sensor is mounted
on the wrist, the sensor material on the wrist is bent and unbent
cyclically). The sensory resistance data collected from the wrist
mounted sensor are shown in Figure 6c,d. Figure 6d shows the change in resistance due to the upward and downward
movements of the wrist joint for a selected section of the total wrist
activity recorded. The results show the capability of the rGO coated
fabric to capture mechanical events such as bending/unbending, stretching/relaxation,
and twisting/untwisting. The woven cotton fabric showed the least
variation in the electrical resistance over long period of cyclic
tensile tests. Figure S11a,b shows that
the woven cotton twill fabric has a different appearance on the front
and back side of the fabric (Supporting Information). This imbalance in the surface structure caused the surface stress
distributions on each side to vary. The strain% of cotton fabric at
the elastic limit is 2%. Therefore, in order to ensure the least amount
of plastic deformation of the fiber structure, the electro-mechanical
performance of these fabrics was investigated within each respective
elastic limit.

Conclusions
We report a simple and
scalable production method for rGO dispersion
and the coating of cotton textile fabrics with the rGO dispersion
in order to produce electrically conductive graphene e-textiles. The
rGO coated fabrics thus produced are washable, flexible, and bendable
and exhibit a significant increase in the fabric tensile strength
and strain%. We also demonstrate the suitability of rGO coated fabric
for applications as strain sensors to monitor human activities. We
believe our scalable production method of producing graphene-based
wearable e-textiles is an important step toward moving from R&D-based
e-textiles to actual real world applications.

Experimental
Methods
Materials
Flake graphite (Grade 3061) was supplied
by Asbury Graphite Mills, USA. Poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS, Mw ∼ 70,000, powder), sodium hydrosulphite
(∼82%), ammonia, potassium permanganate (KMnO4),
sulfuric acid (H2SO4, ∼99%), and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2, ∼30%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, UK, and used as received. 100% Cotton 3/1 twill
fabrics were manufactured internally in the University of Manchester
weaving laboratory and desized, scoured, and bleached.

Synthesis of
GO and rGO
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared
using a modified Hummers method as described elsewhere.37 A brown dispersion of GO (1 mg/mL) was prepared
by adding 160 mg of GO to 160 mL of deionized (DI) water and sonicated
for 30 min. In order to form a stable dispersion, 1.6 g of PSS was
mixed into the GO dispersion by vigorous stirring. The resulting suspension
was transferred to a round-bottom flask placed in an oil bath. Na2S2O4 (1.2 g) and NH3 (required
to adjust pH 9–10) were added to the dispersion with vigorous
stirring. This mixture was held at 90 °C for 12 h under closed
conditions in order to obtain a black dispersion. Any residual Na2S2O4 and PSS were removed from the rGO
by washing several times with deionized water and finally diluted
into distilled water (DI) to adjust the rGO dispersion concentration
to 3.2 mg/mL.

Continuous Pad-Drying of Textiles with rGO
Ink
Textile
fabrics were padded one dip and one nip through rGO dispersions to
a wet pick-up of ∼80% on the weight of the fabric (o.w.f.).
The wet pick-up% was calculated using following formula: 1  

The rGO padded fabrics were subsequently
dried at 100 °C for 10 min and were studied for e-textiles application.
Also, several rGO coated samples were prepared using multiple (1–10)
padding passes to establish any improvement in the electrical conductivity
of rGO coated fabrics. In order to asses with comparable textiles,
a pigment-dyed cotton fabric sample was also prepared using a standard
textile pigment dyeing recipe for 3% pigment black shade (recipe in Supporting Information and Table 1). The same padding method and parameters
were used to apply pigments on the similar fabrics used for e-textiles.

Washability and Humidity Testing
The washability of
the rGO coated cotton fabrics was assessed according to BS EN ISO
105 C06 A1S, by treating rGO coated fabrics in a solution containing
4 g/L ECE reference detergent B and 10 stainless steel balls at 40
°C for 30 min. Ten steel balls were used to simulate the agitation
and abrasion that a garment is subject to during a standard washing
cycle. The fabrics were rinsed subsequently in running water at ambient
temperature and air-dried at room temperature prior to further analysis.

The influence of humidity was measured by exposing the sample to
a range of controlled relative humidity (RH) levels, 11%, 53%, and
97%. To produce different RH environments, saturated aqueous solutions
of LiCl and K2SO4 were prepared (Sigma-Aldrich) and placed
in airtight glass vessels at a temperature of 24 °C, which yielded
atmospheres with RHs of 11% and 97%, respectively. The 53% RH is the
room RH level. The complex impedance spectra (CIS) and I–V data of the sample were measured using
a portable electrochemical interface and impedance analyzer (Ivium
Technologies B.V., Eindhoven, Netherlands).

Materials Characterization
The sheet resistance of
the conductive e-textiles was measured in van der Pouw geometry (a
factor of 4.532 was used to obtain the sheet resistance from the raw
measurements) using a Jandel four-probe system (Jandel Engineering
Ltd., Leighton, UK). The mean sheet resistance was calculated from
the average of six measurements. A Zeiss ultra scanning electron microscope
(SEM) was used to analyze the surface topography of the untreated
and rGO coated fabrics and also the flake size of GO and rGO. The
dispersions were diluted 1000 times and drop-casted on Si/SiO2 (290 nm oxide on plain silicon) for each sample, and images
were taken at 10 different locations on the sample. A dimension icon
(Bruker) atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to determine GO and
rGO flake thickness. A Renishaw Raman system equipped with 633 nm
laser was used to collect Raman spectra of GO and rGO flakes. A Kratos
axis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system was used to characterize
the surface of untreated and rGO coated textiles and also the GO and
rGO flakes.

Tensile strength and strain% of untreated, rGO coated,
and pigment-dyed cotton fabrics (5 × 2.5 cm) were measured by
a Zwick/Roell tensile tester (Zwick Roell Group, Germany) at 200 mm/min
speed and calculated as an average from three measurements in both
warp and weft directions of the fabrics. The Kawabata evaluation system
for fabrics (KES-F) was used to determine the mechanical and surface
properties of untreated and rGO coated (5 padding passes) fabric.54 The samples (20 × 20 cm) were conditioned
for 24 h at 20 °C and 65% RH prior to analysis.

We used
various cord lengths (Figures S8–S10) during bending (concave down) and compression (concave upward)
to measure the change of resistance of rGO coated fabrics (8 ×
1.5 cm). The cord length of the rGO coated fabric was controlled on
a Zwick/Roell tensile tester (Zwick Roell Group, Germany) during bending
and compression tests both in the forward and reverse direction. The
change of sheet resistance with the change of cord lengths of rGO
coated fabric (8 × 1.5 cm) during bending and compression was
captured using a National Instrument 9219 data acquisition card (NI,
American). A piece of rGO coated (5 pass) fabric (8 × 1.5 cm)
was also mounted on a wrist joint, and the changes in resistance of
the rGO coated fabrics due to upward and downward movement were measured
using a National Instrument 9219 card (NI, American).
