Collagen, the major
structural component of nearly all mammalian
tissues, undergoes extensive proteolytic remodeling during developmental
states and a variety of life-threatening diseases such as cancer,
myocardial infarction, and fibrosis. While degraded collagen could
be an important marker of tissue damage, it is difficult to detect
and target using conventional tools. Here, we show that a designed
peptide (collagen hybridizing peptide: CHP), which specifically hybridizes
to the degraded, unfolded collagen chains, can be used to image degraded
collagen and inform tissue remodeling activity in various tissues:
labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein and biotin, CHPs enabled direct
localization and quantification of collagen degradation in isolated
tissues within pathologic states ranging from osteoarthritis and myocardial
infarction to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary fibrosis, as well as
in normal tissues during developmental programs associated with embryonic
bone formation and skin aging. The results indicate the general correlation
between the level of collagen remodeling and the amount of denatured
collagen in tissue and show that the CHP probes can be used across
species and collagen types, providing a versatile tool for not only
pathology and developmental biology research but also histology-based
disease diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic screening. This study
lays the foundation for further testing CHP as a targeting moiety
for theranostic delivery in various animal models.

==== Body
Collagen
is the major structural
component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) present in virtually all
mammalian tissue and organs,1 with an essential
role in supporting cell attachment, proliferation, migration, and
differentiation.1,2 While collagen synthesis and degradation
are delicately coordinated during tissue development and homeostasis,
excessive collagen remodeling has also been implicated in numerous
pathologic states.3−5 For example, collagen degradation mediated by matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) is responsible for cancer progression and
metastasis.6−8 In atherosclerosis, the thinning and weakening of
the fibrous collagen cap by enzymatic degradation renders atherosclerotic
plaques susceptible to rupture, resulting in myocardial infarction
and sudden cardiac death.9 Likewise, the
degeneration of type II collagen, the predominant structural protein
in cartilage, is a key pathogenic step in osteoarthritis.10,11 Independent of its pathologic roles, orchestrated remodeling of
the collagen matrix is also crucial in many developmental events,
such as bone formation and mammary gland morphogenesis.4 Therefore, imaging techniques that detect proteolyzed
collagen in isolated tissues would provide a powerful tool for assessing
the tissue remodeling states associated with a variety of developmental
or pathologic events; a molecular agent that targets the degraded
collagen would also enable site-specific delivery of theranostic molecules
for medical applications.

Despite the obvious importance of
collagen remodeling, current
collagen-targeting and imaging tools either cannot detect degraded
collagen or have significant limitations. For example, widely used
collagen stains, such as Masson’s trichrome or Picrosirius
red, rely purely on electrostatic interactions for binding12 and cannot distinguish intact collagen from
the degraded.13 Likewise, most anticollagen
antibodies are made for multiple applications under both denaturing
and nondenaturing conditions (e.g., in Western blot and immunohistochemistry), indicating that their
affinities are not affected by the collagen conformation. Antibodies
with higher specificity have been developed to recognize degraded
collagen as a consequence of the generation of new N- or C-terminal
epitopes or as soluble collagen fragments, but only for a handful
of the 28 mammalian collagen subtypes.14−19 More importantly, these antibodies fail to detect collagen fragments
in tissues if specific epitopes are lost following more extensive
proteolysis. Microscopic methods, such as second-harmonic generation
(SHG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), have also been used
to visualize fibrillar collagen20 where
a reduction of SHG signal21 or the disruption
of the periodic D-banding pattern in TEM22,23 can indicate alteration of collagen structure. However, such measurements
are based on the loss of signal or structural features at the fiber
scale that does not directly reveal the degradation events occurring
at the molecular level.

We envisioned that the triple-helical
structure of collagen provides
a unique mechanism for targeting collagen degradation.24,25 All of the 28 collagen subtypes found in mammals share a basic structural
motif in which the three protein strands intertwine into a triple
helix stabilized by interstrand hydrogen bonds (Figure 1).2 Importantly,
this supersecondary conformation is nearly exclusive to collagens.26 Nevertheless, following degradation by collagenolytic
proteases, such as those belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase
or cysteine proteinase families, the fragmented collagen triple helices
are no longer thermally stable at body temperature and spontaneously
unfold (Figure 1),
leaving the denatured collagen fragments covalently cross-linked within
the partially degraded, insoluble collagen matrix.24,27−29 To unequivocally detect proteolyzed collagen in situ, we set out to develop a synthetic peptide termed
the collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP), which specifically binds to
denatured collagen strands by re-forming a triple-helical structure
in a fashion that is similar to primer binding to melted DNA strands
during polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) (Figure 1).24,25,30,31 The CHP has a repeating sequence
of glycine(G)–proline(P)–hydroxyproline(O), an amino
acid triplet with the highest folding propensity for the triple-helical
structure found among all GXY units in the native collagen sequence.32 The single-strand CHPs showed excellent ability
to hybridize with unfolded collagen chains denatured by heat or protease
activities,24,25,30,31,33,34 but negligible affinity to intact collagen due to
the absence of binding sites. In addition, the neutral and hydrophilic
amino acid composition of CHP makes it virtually nonadherent to other
biomolecules.24,25

Figure 1 Schematic of a CHP strand (labeled with
X) hybridizing to denatured
collagen chains and forming a collagen triple helix. During disease
progression, tissue development, or aging, collagen can be extensively
degraded by collagenolytic proteases, causing its triple helix to
unfold at the physiological temperature due to reduced thermal stability.
X represents the biotin or fluorescent tag.

In our previous work,24,25 we reported CHP’s
ability to target collagen remodeling caused by cancer xenografts
and Marfan’s syndrome in vivo. However, its
ability to detect degraded collagen in isolated histopathologic samples
has never been demonstrated. More importantly, it remained to be shown
that the presence of degraded collagen is a hallmark feature shared
by almost every tissue type and numerous pathologic conditions beyond
cancer and Marfan’s syndrome.3−5 In this study, we used
fluorescence microscopy to evaluate the binding of CHPs labeled with
5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM) or biotin on a series of animal and human
tissue samples that have undergone remodeling during representative
pathologic (e.g., osteoarthritis,
myocardial infarction, glomerulonephritis, lung fibrosis) and physiologic
events (e.g., bone development,
skin aging). We demonstrate that the CHP binding effectively reports
the level and location of denatured collagen products generated in vivo. Given the wide distribution of collagen in mammalian
tissues,1 our results suggest that CHP
represents a versatile, but simple staining tool for monitoring many,
if not all, remodeling events in isolated tissues and a potential
delivery vehicle for targeting a wide range of tissues damaged by
disease or injury.

Results and Discussion
Design of the Study
We selected the following tissue
samples to investigate the specifics of CHP binding because they represent
a full spectrum of known scenarios involving ECM remodeling and collagen
degradation,3 ranging from tissue degeneration
(e.g., osteoarthritis), acute inflammation
(e.g., myocardial infarction), and
fibrotic remodeling (e.g., glomerulonephritis
and pulmonary fibrosis) to tissue development (e.g., embryonic bone formation) and aging (e.g., chronological skin aging).

Prior to staining
pathologic tissues with CHPs, we evaluated and optimized the staining
protocol using a set of ligament cryosections that had been heated
to 80 °C to purposefully denature collagen. CHP was synthesized
by solid phase peptide synthesis, followed by N-terminal labeling
with either 5-FAM (designated as F-CHP) for fluorescence imaging or
biotin (designated as B-CHP) for neutravidin/streptavidin-mediated
detection via non-green fluorescence channels (e.g., AlexaFluor647-labeled streptavidin) or colorimetric
reaction (e.g., horseradish peroxidase
conjugated neutravidin). Because the CHP strands can slowly self-assemble
into triple helices, thereby lose the driving force to hybridize with
collagen, a heating-and-quenching step was applied to the CHP solution
immediately prior to staining (Figure S1, see Methods for details). Following this
protocol, we detected strong fluorescence signals from F-CHP bound
to heat-denatured ligaments in a concentration-dependent fashion using
1 to 100 μM of CHP (Figure S2A).
We also observed that the fluorescence signal of F-CHP rises steadily
as the staining time increases (Figure S2B). Based on these preliminary results, an optimal combination of
CHP concentration (15–30 μM) and staining time (≥16
h) was used in subsequent experiments with native tissues.

Osteoarthritis
Type II collagen is the predominant
component of cartilage, and its enzymatic breakdown represents a crucial
molecular event during osteoarthritis (OA).10,11,35 As such, cryosections of human OA articular
cartilage were stained with Safranin O and F-CHP, and tissue sites
within the diseased region were compared to unaffected regions. Safranin
O staining confirmed near intact architecture in normal regions of
the cartilage tissue (Figure 2A). By contrast, in diseased regions, pathologic features
of OA were clearly observed, including extensive vertical fissures
and matrix fibrillation extending into the midzone, as well as enlarged
lacunae and chondrocyte loss (Figure 2A). F-CHP staining highlighted fibrous structures with
strong fluorescence intensity arising in the superficial and mid zones
of the OA cartilage, indicating collagen degradation and denaturation
(Figure 2B). Only low-intensity
F-CHP fluorescence was observed in the superficial zone of the normal
control (Figure 2B).
Hence, our results confirm that matrices of normal and disease cartilage
can be readily differentiated with CHP staining and that the increased
CHP binding to the OA tissue strongly suggests collagen degradation.

and each image is representative of similar results from three stained
sections. Scale bars: 500 μm.

Myocardial Infarction
Following myocardial infarction
(MI), degradation of the collagen matrix by the proteolytic enzymes
released from infiltrating leukocytes is a major determinant of the
irreversible tissue damage that occurs during the inflammatory phase
of the disease process.36 To visualize
degraded collagen, cryosections of hearts harvested from mice at varying
time points after occlusion of the left anterior descending artery37 were probed with B-CHP and further visualized
with AlexaFluor647-labeled streptavidin. Whole-heart fluorescence
images demonstrate that denatured collagen is visible at day 3 post-MI,
with the CHP signal increasing significantly at day 7 and persisting
until day 14 (Figure 3A). F-CHP staining of sections from the same hearts alternately processed
by paraffin-embedding showed similar results (Figure S3). The quantified CHP fluorescence signals obtained
from whole-section scanning of the hearts within each group confirmed
elevated levels of collagen degradation, which peaked at 1 week postinfarction
(Figure 3B). This result
is in agreement with previous studies on similar mouse models where
MMPsense probes and zymography were used to demonstrate increased
MMP activity that reached maximal levels at 1 to 2 weeks post-MI.38 Interestingly, images of the 1-week post-MI
hearts costained with B-CHP and an anti-CD68 antibody showed that
the CHP binding was located in regions enriched with infiltrating
macrophages (Figure 3, C and D), suggesting the correlation between collagen degradation
and the recruited inflammatory cells.36

region within the red box in panel (C) with merged fluorescence signals
shows that high level of degraded collagen is in areas crowded with
macrophages. Scale bars: 1 mm (A, C), 50 μm (D).

Glomerulonephritis
Glomerulonephritis
is a group of
inflammatory kidney diseases characterized by glomerular damage.39−41 The destruction of glomerular architecture, in turn, accelerates
remodeling of the surrounding extracellular matrix, thereby leading
to fibrotic scarring (glomerulosclerosis).39−41 In the glomeruli
of anti-Thy-1 nephritic rats, a classic animal model of glomerulonephritis,
elevated MMP expression, and increased collagen deposition is well
documented in the literature.40−43 As such, we first analyzed kidney cryosections harvested
from the anti-Thy-1 nephritic and normal control rats with the conventional
periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain. As expected, the amount of
mesangial matrix occupying each glomerulus was higher in the affected
kidneys (Figure 4A),
confirming the fibrotic glomerular expansion. Following F-CHP staining,
strong signals were recorded in the glomeruli of the nephritic animals
with minimal staining intensity detected in normal kidneys (Figure 4B). Interestingly,
the CHP signal is confined to the diseased glomeruli, whereas type
IV collagen (visualized by immunofluorescence staining) is uniformly
distributed in the tissue, including the interstitial space (Figure 4B). Similar results
were obtained when the sections were stained with B-CHP and further
visualized using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated neutravidin
(Figure S4). Given that F-CHP signals and
anti-collagen IV antibody staining were colocalized in the glomeruli
(Figure 4B), the unfolded/degraded
type IV collagen localized in the basement membrane region is the
most likely target of CHP, though we cannot exclude the possibly of
CHP binding to minor basement-membrane-associated collagen types.44 Hence, the PAS and CHP staining results validate
that nephritic glomeruli contain elevated amounts of collagen with
a partially degraded and unfolded structure. The CHP stain pinpoints
the glomerular lesion; such high specificity is nearly impossible
to achieve with conventional staining tools, which are typically insensitive
to the structural change of their targets.

sections per animal. Scale bar: 100 μm.

Pulmonary Fibrosis
Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic
agent with known pulmonary toxicity that leads to fibrotic changes
in animal models that mimic those observed in idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis patients.45 Aberrant wound healing
responses, involving both increased MMP activity46,47 and excess matrix deposition,45,48 have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in this model. Using MMPsense
680, a probe that fluoresces in the near-infrared region after MMP
cleavage, we confirmed elevated MMP activity in the fibrotic lungs
of bleomycin-treated mice relative to normal controls (Figure S5). To visualize the accumulation of
damaged collagen within the remodeling lung matrix at the tissue and
cellular levels, F-CHP staining was applied to a set of lung cryosections
harvested at varying time points after bleomycin delivery via an implanted osmotic pump. F-CHP staining revealed the
spotty distribution of damaged collagen, indicated by the highly localized,
bright F-CHP deposits appearing in samples beginning 1 week after
bleomycin treatment (Figure 5A). Representative images of F-CHP staining and quantitative
analysis demonstrated that (i) the number of “bright spots”
was significantly higher in the subpleural area of the lungs relative
to the center, particularly after week 3, and that (ii) the overall
CHP signals in both the central and subpleural areas increased as
the disease progressed from week 1 to week 3 and persisted through
week 4 (Figure 5, A
and B). These spatial and temporal schemes are in strong agreement
with a recent study demonstrating that the inflammation and fibrosis
observed in this mouse model are limited to the subpleural portion
of the lung.48 Co-staining of the tissues
with B-CHP and an anti-MMP2 antibody showed that MMP2 expression followed
a spatial and temporal pattern similar to that observed with the CHP
signals (Figure S6). In magnified images
of the costained fields, we noted that areas displaying high MMP2
signals often overlapped with zones of decreased CHP intensity (Figure 5C, arrows; Figure S7), perhaps presenting a snapshot of
the MMP2-dependent digestion of denatured collagen chains within the
lung ECM.49−51 To the best of our knowledge, our CHP staining results
provide the first direct evidence of the structural abnormality of
collagen molecules within fibrotic tissues (Figures 4 and 5).

Bone Development
In mammals, most bone is formed by
endochondral ossification, a process wherein a cartilage template
is eventually degraded by hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblast-like
cells and then replaced by mineralized bone tissue.52 Given a collagen remodeling program highlighted by the
proteolytic replacement of type II and X collagen by newly formed
type I collagen,52 we sought to visualize
this classic developmental process in mouse embryo sagittal sections
by CHP staining (Figure 6). In contrast to type I collagen staining that highlighted the uniform
distribution of collagen in the 18-day postcoitum embryo (designated
as E18), collagen degradation detected by CHP was localized exclusively
in the developing skeletal tissue, including the mandibular bone,
maxilla, basioccipital and basisphenoid bone, vertebrae, ribs, hipbone,
and digital bones (Figure 6A). No CHP binding was detected in nonskeletal tissues, such
as skin, kidney, muscle, or heart. This distinct spatial pattern closely
matches previous studies using in situ hybridization
techniques demonstrating that interstitial collagenase expression
is restricted to skeletal tissue during mouse embryogenesis.53,54 Magnified images further revealed that CHP signals were particularly
high in the hypertrophic cartilage zone abutting ossification sites
(Figure 6B), supporting
the conclusion that the collagen-degrading activity of hypertrophic
chondrocytes resides in this zone. CHP staining of a series of embryos
from E12 to E18 demonstrated that ossification-zone-associated collagen
degradation could be clearly detected after E14 (Figure S8), a finding in agreement with previous studies showing
that the expression of interstitial collagenase begins on day 15 of
gestation,55 whereas the major collagenase
expressed at ossification sites (i.e., MMP13) is detectable from E14.5.56 Taken
together, our data indicate that CHP binding can be used to follow
spatiotemporal changes in collagen remolding during endochondral ossification
and skeletal development.

same fashion. High levels of CHP binding are found in the hypertrophic
zone surrounding the newly deposited collagen I bone matrix (yellow
arrow heads), which is visualized by the anti-collagen I antibody.
Scale bars: 3 mm (A), 0.5 mm (B).

Skin Aging
In chronologically aged skin, structural
changes in the type I collagen-rich dermis have been linked to increased
MMP expression22,29,57 and, presumably, collagenolytic activity. To determine whether degraded
collagen fragments can be detected in aging tissues, we stained skin
samples obtained from sun-protected 21-day-old versus 9-month-old mice with B-CHP followed by AlexaFluor647-streptavidin.
Fluorescence micrographs revealed that higher levels of degraded collagen
fragments were clearly present in the dermis of the aged skin samples
(Figure 7A). We also
conducted SHG microscopy to visualize the collagen fibers20 in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy.
The F-CHP-stained skin samples were imaged using multiphoton confocal
microscopy, simultaneously acquiring the collagen fiber SHG signal
and the F-CHP fluorescence signal on separate channels. SHG imaging
revealed that mature collagen fibers were observable only in the old
skin samples (Figure 7B), presumably because the
collagen fibers in the young skin were not sufficiently sized or organized
to generate a detectable signal. Meanwhile, the F-CHP signal clearly
separated the two groups (Figure 7B). This suggests that collagen in young skin is intact
at the molecular level, but immature in terms of fiber formation,
whereas collagen in aged skin has a mature fiber structure, but with
partial degradation and denaturation. These results highlight the
fact that the two techniques depict distinct aspects of the dermal
architecture; that is, while SHG imaging integrates the general collagen-fiber
morphology, the CHP stain specifically targets the damaged collagen
molecules.

frozen skin sections from the same group of mice, stained by F-CHP,

Both experiments were performed on skin samples obtained from 3 mice
at each age with similar results. Scale bars: 100 μm (A), 150
μm (B).

In this study, we demonstrated
that denatured collagen generated
during tissue remodeling can be effectively detected using CHP hybridization
in a variety of tissues in pathologic as well as developmental states.
The spatiotemporal features of collagen degradation as detected by
CHP staining in diseased or developing tissues correlated closely
with the time course of MMP expression and activity, as well as the
distribution of MMPs reported by others in similar animal models.37,38,48,53,54 Furthermore, CHP staining without the heat-dissociation
step confirmed the absence of signals in tissues that were stained
with the folded CHP trimers (Figure S9),
verifying that the CHP binding visualized in all the images is driven
by the triple-helical hybridization and is not due to nonspecific
interactions and autofluorescence of the tissues. CHP is designed
to target the dominant secondary protein structure of the entire collagen
family. As a result, the peptide has the ability to bind multiple,
if not all, types of denatured collagen. In agreement with an in-gel
Western blot analysis in our previous study,58 our data here indicate that CHP binds to denatured collagens in
cartilage (type II), kidney (type IV), lung and skin (type I, III)
as well as those from different species (i.e., mouse, rat, porcine, and human). We also note that CHP
specifically detects degraded collagen without antigen retrieval in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections, a processing protocol
that proves problematic for antibodies whose epitopes can be modified
during sample preparation. Thus, CHP should be considered a broad-spectrum
reagent for detecting collagen degradation. However, it should be
noted that its broad-spectrum affinity limits its ability to distinguish
between different degraded collagen types, a shortcoming that could
be overcome when CHP staining is used in conjunction with type-specific
collagen antibodies. We also note that several noncollagenous proteins,26 such as complement factor C1q, mannose binding
protein, and bacterial collagen-like proteins, also contain short
triple-helical domains of Gly-X-Y repeats and that after unfolding
they could be targets for CHP hybridization.58 However, it critically depends on whether their collagen-like triple
helices are susceptible to enzymatic digestion and unfolding in vivo,59,60 a question that remains to be
fully investigated. In addition, we do not recommend CHP staining
on FFPE samples processed with common antigen retrieval methods, such
as microwaving with citric acid or proteinase K, which might denature
collagen molecules and enhance CHP binding artificially.

Currently, attempts to assess collagen degradation
(whether in vivo or in vitro) are
indirect and alternatively
focus on the detection of collagenolytic proteinases (e.g., MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-14, cathepsin K).
While mRNA levels for collagenolytic enzymes can be monitored by the
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein
expression via Western blotting or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA), the precise identity of the proteinases
involved in collagenolysis cannot be determined, as the enzymes are
expressed as inactive zymogens. Furthermore, even following activation,
collagenolytic enzymes can be inhibited by endogenous inhibitors (e.g., TIMPs, cystatin, alpha-2-macroglobulin),3 which are often jointly upregulated.46In situ zymography is a method
used frequently to detect and localize MMP activities in frozen tissues
using fluorescently labeled gelatin or collagen as a substrate.61 However, the technique is more sensitive for
detecting gelatinases as opposed to true collagenases and does not
assess the structural integrity of the surrounding ECM. On the contrary,
the CHP stain provides direct evidence of collagen degradation, albeit
without identifying the responsible collagenases. In cases where the
integrity of the ECM is critical for the pathologic outcome, such
as in cancer cell metastasis or atherosclerotic plaque rupture, interrogating
the structural status of the collagen matrix directly may be more
informative than the identity of the involved proteinase(s). In addition,
if used in tandem with more standard collagenase detection methods,
CHP could be a tool to validate, or even contradict, the links existing
within the complex interaction network of collagenases and ECM in vivo.

Conclusions
As outlined in this
study, degraded collagen is an informative
marker of tissue damage and remodeling whose level reflects the progression
of disease as well as the regulation of developmental programs. Conventional
histology stains often require a trained pathologist for interpretation,
and the changes in the tissue structure are difficult to quantify.
By contrast, the CHP stain provides a straightforward method to visualize
and quantify tissue remodeling in situ. From the
practical aspect, as CHP is not an antibody-based approach, there
are no species conflicts between CHP and a tissue sample or between
CHP and a primary antibody used during double staining. With these
advantages, the CHP probe can be used as a preferred special stain
to analyze animal tissue or human biopsy with diverse biological and
medical applications, including phenotyping in developmental biology,
disease staging and prognosis, and therapeutic screening. Interestingly,
CHP is highly stable in serum62 and possesses
a chemically inert sequence that can be readily conjugated to an imaging
probe or a therapeutic agent. We previously demonstrated CHP’s
ability to target pathologic tissues in vivo(24) and the ease to prepare CHP-functionalized nanomaterials.34,63 With the results of this study, we propose that CHP could be further
developed into a useful agent for in vivo imaging
and drug delivery.

were verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) MS on a Bruker UltrafleXtreme. The lyophilized, purified
peptide powders were dissolved in deionized water at a concentration
of 100 μM and stored at 4 °C.

Tissue Samples and Animals
Porcine medial cruciate
ligaments were a kind gift from the Jeffrey Weiss group (University
of Utah). Frozen human cartilage tissue sections from a 73-year-old
OA patient were purchased from OriGene (catalog numbers: CS522857
and CS522859). A panel of the C57 mouse embryo sagittal frozen tissue
sections was obtained from Zyagen (MF-104-008-C57). Frozen, hair-removed
skin tissues from the lower back of 3-week-old and 9-month-old male
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Two pieces
of tissue were dissected from each skin sample. One piece was snap-frozen
in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, and the other piece
was fixed in formalin followed by paraffin embedding; both were cut
into 5 μm thick sections. Infarcted hearts from 8-week-old C57BL/6J
mice were purchased from CL Laboratory (Baltimore, MD, USA). Hearts
were harvested from mice at varying time points (three mice per group)
after a standard left anterior descending artery occlusion procedure.37 Each heart was axially dissected into two halves.
The bottom half was snap-frozen in OCT, and the top half was fixed
in formalin followed by paraffin embedding; 10 μm thick sections
exposing the whole axial plane of the hearts were cut from the OCT-
and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.

The following study procedure
was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Glomerulonephritis was induced by tail vein injection
of the monoclonal anti-Thy-1 Ab OX-7 (1.75 mg/kg body weight) to a
male rat (220 to 250 g in body weight) on day 0. The OX-7 mAb binds
to a Thy-1 epitope on the surface of mesangial cells and causes complement-dependent
cell lysis followed by exuberant matrix synthesis and deposition.41 Normal control animals were injected with the
same volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The experiment was
performed using three rats per group. At day 12, the rats were anesthetized
with isoflurane, and the kidneys perfused with 30 mL of cold PBS and
harvested. One piece of renal cortical tissue from individual rats
was snap-frozen, and one piece of renal cortical tissue was fixed
in 10% neutralized formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological
staining as described previously.41

The following study procedure was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of MedImmune LLC. Lung fibrosis in C57BL/6
mice (female, 10-week-old; Jackson Laboratories) was induced with
bleomycin at a dose of 70 mg/kg via osmotic minipumps
(ALZET 1007D) designed to deliver 0.5 μL/h for 7 days. On day
0, the osmotic minipumps, containing either 100 μL of saline
vehicle or bleomycin, were implanted under isofluorane anesthesia
under the skin on the back of the mice posterior to the scapulae.
Mice were euthanized at indicated times, and the lungs were inflated
with 1 mL of 50% OCT in PBS. The right lung lobes were harvested,
snap-frozen in OCT, and cut into 5 μm thick sections.

Tissue sectioning and the PAS staining using paraffin-embedded
kidney tissue were performed at the University of Utah health care
research histology core facility using standard procedures.

CHP Staining
For OCT-embedded tissue sections, the
OCT compound was removed by rinsing with PBS for 5 min after tissue
slides were warmed to room temperature. For FFPE tissue sections,
paraffin was removed by rinsing with xylene, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol,
50% ethanol, and deionized water for two 5 min cycles of each solvent
in consecutive order. The deparaffinized tissue was directly used
for staining without any antigen-retrieval process. After the embedding
material was removed, 5% goat serum in PBS was added to the tissue
sections and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to block nonspecific
binding. For B-CHP staining, any endogenous biotin in the tissue was
blocked using the endogenous biotin-blocking kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol after the serum blocking step. Because CHP can self-assemble
into homotrimers in solution over time (e.g., during storage at 4 °C) and lose its driving force
for collagen hybridization, the trimeric CHP was thermally dissociated
to single strands by heating briefly at 80 °C before it was used
to bind unfolded collagen.25 To prevent
undesired thermal denaturation of the tissue, the 80 °C CHP solution
was quenched quickly to room temperature immediately prior to addition
to tissue samples (dead time <2 min). The CHP trimerization has
a third-order folding rate with a half-time on the order of hours
at low μM concentrations.26,65,66 Therefore, the heating and quenching protocol used here (Figure S1) ensures that CHP strands predominate
in the active monomer form until exposed to denatured collagen. After
the blocking solutions were gently removed from the slides, heat-activated
solutions of single-strand CHPs were added to the tissue sections
in the following fashion. CHP solution (15 μM of B-CHP or F-CHP,
50–200 μL per section) in PBS or PBS containing 1% BSA
(when costaining with an antibody) was heated for 5 min in an 80 °C
water bath to dissociate the trimeric peptides, followed by immediate
incubation in an ice/water bath (for 15–90 s depending on the
solution volume) to quench the hot solution to room temperature. When
needed, an antibody was diluted into this quenched CHP solution for
costaining. The solution containing the quenched CHP monomers was
quickly pipetted to each slide (usually 50–200 μL per
section) within 1 min. The tissue samples were incubated in a humidity
chamber at 4 °C overnight. After staining, the slides were incubated
for 5 min in 100 mL of PBS at room temperature to remove the unbound
material and the washing step was repeated three times. For B-CHP
staining, the tissue sections were subsequently incubated with AlexaFluor647-labeled
streptavidin (0.005 mg/mL) in a PBS solution containing 1% BSA. To
detect the costained primary antibody, a labeled secondary antibody
was either diluted into the AlexaFluor647-streptavidin solution (for
B-CHP costaining) or added to the slides directly after dilution in
a PBS solution containing 1% BSA (for F-CHP costaining). The tissues
were incubated with the streptavidin and/or secondary antibody solution
in a humidity chamber for 1 h at room temperature. Where indicated,
cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 20 min according
to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Finally, the tissue sections
were rinsed with PBS three times and mounted with Fluoroshield. The
specific CHP, antibody types, and concentrations used in each experiment
are presented in Table S1. All histological
staining experiments were performed on at least three different sections
from each tissue sample. For the myocardial infarction, glomerulonephritis,
lung fibrosis, and skin aging experiments, tissue samples from three
animals within each experimental group (e.g., the normal control group, the week 3 group) were analyzed.

Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis
All tissue
sections in this work were imaged or scanned using an EVOS FL auto
cell imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 4, 10, 20, or
40× objective lens. Fluorescence from Hoechst 33342, 5-FAM/FITC,
AlexaFluor555, and AlexaFluor647 was detected using the DAPI, GFP,
RFP, and Cy5 light cube, respectively. The tissues stained by hematoxylin
and HRP-neutravidin were imaged under a bright-light field. Large
whole-section images were created through view-to-view scanning and
image-stitching automatically performed by the EVOS imaging system.
Identical microscopic settings were used to allow direct comparison
of CHP or antibody binding among the samples within each experiment.

For clarity, images were assigned with pseudocolors using the LUT
color schemes available in the ImageJ software with heat-map-like
multicolor schemes selected for images in Figures 3A, 5A, and 5C to highlight the intensity variation. Fluorescence
signals resulting from B-CHP binding to the heart sections in the
myocardial infarction experiment were analyzed in the ImageJ software
using measurements of the mean intensity times the area of all remaining
pixels after background subtraction. The CHP signals were normalized
by the size of each heart section (estimated by the total area of
all positive pixels in the images of the Hoechst 33342 stain) and
are shown in Figure 3B. F-CHP fluorescence from fibrotic lung tissues was analyzed in
the ImageJ software using measurements of the mean intensity times
the area of all remaining pixels after background subtraction. Two
photomicrographs of the central area and three photomicrographs of
the subpleural areas taken from each lung section were analyzed, and
the procedure was repeated for three lung samples in each experimental
group. The quantified values were averaged in each category and are
presented in Figure 5B.

SHG Imaging
A drop of PBS was applied to each of the
frozen mouse skin section previously stained with F-CHP (three per
age group) and covered with a glass cover slide. The slides were immersed
in deionized water and imaged by a custom Prairie View Ultima multiphoton
microscope (Bruker). A single excitation wavelength at 800 nm was
used to simultaneously visualize collagen fibers and F-CHP binding
in the tissue. The resulting SHG and 5-FAM fluorescence signals were
detected at 435–485 nm and 500–550 nm, respectively.
Z-stack images were acquired for the entire 5 μm section depth
and stacked into a single image using the ImageJ software.

Statistics
The quantitative results are presented as
the mean + standard error. Comparisons among groups were performed
using one-way ANOVA with posthoc Tukey HSD test. Differences were considered statistically significant
at P < 0.05.
