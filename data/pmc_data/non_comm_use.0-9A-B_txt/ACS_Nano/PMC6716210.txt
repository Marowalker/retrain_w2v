The
functionalization of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) with sp3 defects that act as luminescent exciton
traps is a powerful means to enhance their photoluminescence quantum
yield (PLQY) and to add optical properties. However, the synthetic
methods employed to introduce these defects are currently limited
to aqueous dispersions of surfactant-coated SWNTs, often with short
tube lengths, residual metallic nanotubes, and poor film-formation
properties. In contrast to that, dispersions of polymer-wrapped SWNTs
in organic solvents feature unrivaled purity, higher PLQY, and are
easily processed into thin films for device applications. Here, we
introduce a simple and scalable phase-transfer method to solubilize
diazonium salts in organic nonhalogenated solvents for the controlled
reaction with polymer-wrapped SWNTs to create luminescent aryl defects.
Absolute PLQY measurements are applied to reliably quantify the defect-induced
brightening. The optimization of defect density and trap depth results
in PLQYs of up to 4% with 90% of photons emitted through the defect
channel. We further reveal the strong impact of initial SWNT quality
and length on the relative brightening by sp3 defects.
The efficient and simple production of large quantities of defect-tailored
polymer-sorted SWNTs enables aerosol-jet printing and spin-coating
of thin films with bright and nearly reabsorption-free defect emission,
which are desired for carbon nanotube-based near-infrared light-emitting
devices.

The combination
of narrow-band
emission in the near-infrared (NIR) and high charge carrier mobilities
make semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) highly
desirable materials for optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting
diodes1,2 and field-effect transistors.3−5 The fabrication of such devices based on homogeneous thin films
requires concentrated SWNT inks without any metallic nanotubes6 that can be processed easily and reproducibly.
While photoluminescence (PL) from SWNTs was first observed in aqueous
dispersions stabilized by surfactants,7 nowadays selective wrapping with conjugated polymers in organic
solvents is often applied for the extraction of semiconducting SWNTs
with the highest purity and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs).8 In conjunction with mild and scalable exfoliation
methods such as shear force mixing,9 large
volumes of dispersions with high concentrations of long SWNTs with
high quality can be produced by polymer wrapping. These dispersions
are ideal for the deposition of homogeneous films by spin-coating,10 aerosol-jet11 or
inkjet printing,12 owing to the beneficial
properties of organic solvents (surface tension, viscosity, vapor
pressure, etc.). However, despite the substantial
progress in terms of purification and processing, light-emitting devices
based on carbon nanotubes are still limited by their low absolute
PLQYs (∼1% in dispersion and ∼0.1% in films) resulting
from the presence of low-lying dark exciton states13 and the fast diffusion of mobile excitons to nonradiative
quenching sites.14,15

The most promising approach
to enhance the PLQY of SWNTs is their
functionalization with a limited number of oxygen16,17 or sp3 defects18−20 that act as luminescent exciton
traps with depths on the order of 100 meV. Excitons trapped at these
defect sites are not subject to otherwise dominant diffusion-limited
contact-quenching,14 and the modification
of the local electronic structure by the defects enables radiative
relaxation and red-shifted emission (labeled as E11*, or E11*– for different binding configurations).21−24 As demonstrated by Piao et al.,18 the emission from sp3 defects that
are introduced to the SWNT lattice via aryldiazonium
chemistry can be much brighter than that of pristine SWNTs. This report
motivated a series of studies on the population mechanism25 and relaxation dynamics26−29 of these emissive trap states
and the impact of the different binding configurations on their optical
properties.22,30−32 Moreover, it
was shown that sp3 defects in SWNTs can be employed for
room-temperature single-photon emission in the NIR,29−31,33 PL imaging within the second biological window34 and sensing.35 However,
the synthetic methods for the creation of such sp3 defects
usually involve the use of highly polar reagents,18,36 such as diazonium salts. They are thus limited to dispersions of
SWNTs in water. While it is possible to sort semiconducting SWNTs
by chromatography or two-phase extraction of aqueous dispersions,37,38 the superior purity of polymer-sorted SWNTs for a minimum of purification
steps makes them preferable for optoelectronic applications.6,9,39,40

Given the advantages of polymer-wrapped SWNTs in organic solvents
it is highly desirable to develop an easy and reproducible sp3 functionalization method for these systems. The main challenge
is the conflict between the solubility of polar diazonium salts and
the colloidal stability of SWNTs wrapped with nonpolar conjugated
polymers. Although the in situ generation of diazonium
salts may be used, this approach suffers from limited scalability,
as it requires elevated temperatures and inert conditions.41,42 Other attempts, for example, by dip-doping, were limited to predeposited
polymer-sorted nanotubes and only successful with very reactive diazonium
salts.31

Here, we present a simple
and scalable method to create luminescent
sp3 defects in polymer-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs in organic nonhalogenated
solvents. The addition of a polar cosolvent and a phase-transfer agent
allows the preformed diazonium salts to be solubilized and to react
with the SWNTs at room temperature. Because of the high concentration
and purity of the resulting dispersions of functionalized SWNTs, the
absorption features arising from the defects can be analyzed in detail
for the first time. These data give insights into reorganization processes
upon exciton trapping and site-to-site interactions. To reliably quantify
the functionalization-induced brightening, we determine the PLQY by
absolute measurements in an integrating sphere and demonstrate the
influence of defect density and trap depth on the PLQY enhancement.
We reveal the strong impact of initial SWNT quality and length on
the relative brightening by sp3 defects. This simple functionalization
method provides access to large quantities of polymer-wrapped and
sp3-functionalized SWNTs that can be easily processed into
thin or thick films with enhanced PLQY that may enable brighter NIR
light-emitting devices.

Results and Discussion
Our method
for creating luminescent sp3 defects in polymer-wrapped
SWNTs relies on the solubilization of preformed aryldiazonium salts
by an ether crown43 (here, 18-crown-6)
in a moderately polar medium (see Figure 1). This reaction approach avoids chlorinated
solvents while facilitating large-scale functionalization of polymer-wrapped
carbon nanotubes with a minimum of processing steps. As a model system
we use (6,5) SWNTs, which are extracted with high purity by selective
dispersion with the polyfluorene copolymer poly-[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(6,6′)-(2,2′-bipyridine)]
(PFO-BPy) in toluene (see Methods). A mixture
of toluene and acetonitrile (MeCN) in an 80:20 vol % ratio is sufficiently
polar to solubilize aryldiazonium salts at concentrations on the order
of a few grams per liter in the presence of 18-crown-6 as a phase-transfer
agent, yet it does not lead to substantial aggregation of (6,5) SWNTs
or free PFO-BPy as corroborated by absorption and PL spectra (see
the Supporting Information, Figure S1).
A low concentration (1 × 10–9 mol L–1) of potassium acetate (KOAc) is included to optimize the selectivity
of the functionalization process (for details, see the Supporting
Information, Figure S2). After a typical
reaction time of 16 h at room temperature and in the dark, the SWNTs
are collected by vacuum filtration, and unreacted diazonium salt is
washed off with acetonitrile and toluene. This washing step is crucial,
as we found the SWNT PL emission of the reaction mixture to be strongly
quenched by diazonium salts adsorbed on the SWNT surface. In aqueous
media less than 10% of the added diazonium salt actually reacts with
the SWNT lattice to form sp3 defects,44 and the reactivity in organic solvents turns out to be
even lower. This drop in reactivity might result from differences
in the reaction mechanism (see the Supporting Information), the surface accessibility provided by the wrapping
polymer or steric hindrance due to ether crown complexation. Hence,
it is likely that a large number of unreacted aryldiazonium cations
are adsorbed on the SWNTs and quench the PL. After they are washed,
the sp3-functionalized (6,5) SWNTs are easily redispersed
in pure solvent (here, toluene) by bath sonication, and their intrinsic
spectroscopic properties in dispersion can be studied. Note that the
filtration and washing step does not constitute an additional workload,
as it also removes most of the excess polymer, which is often a necessary
step in film and device fabrication. A detailed experimental protocol
for sp3 functionalization of PFO-BPy-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs
is provided in the Supporting Information.

salts in a toluene/acetonitrile mixture containing 18-crown-6 as a
phase-transfer agent.

The overall procedure
is scalable to large amounts of functionalized
(6,5) SWNTs that can be redispersed at different low or high concentrations
thus enabling reliable absorption measurements, determination of the
absolute PLQY, and creation of thick luminescent films. To establish
the robustness and applicability of our procedure for polymer-wrapped
SWNTs, we employ the outlined routine to introduce aryl defects from
low to high defect densities and with substituents ranging from electron-withdrawing
to electron-donating character and then characterize their optical
properties in detail.

First, we discuss the spectral characteristics
of sp3-functionalized PFO-BPy-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs using
the example of
4-bromophenyl defects as shown in Figure 2. In addition to the strong E11 transition at ∼994 nm, the absorption spectra
of the dispersions in Figure 2a show an absorption band at ∼1142 nm that grows systematically
with the concentration of reagent used. Since unreacted diazonium
salt and adsorbed byproducts were removed by washing, and the untreated
reference sample does not show any absorption features in this spectral
range, we can unambiguously assign this band to sp3 defects.
Previous assignments of this transition in the literature were complicated
by the presence of minority chiralities and low concentrations of
functionalized SWNTs.18 These issues are
absent from dispersions prepared by polymer-wrapping. The highest E11*/E11 absorbance
ratio in this study was 0.13; however, without knowledge of the extinction
coefficient of the defect absorption this value still does not enable
an absolute quantification of the number of defects in the lattice
(vide infra).

Emission Spectra and Stokes
Shift
Photoluminescence
excitation at the E22 transition (575
nm) of (6,5) SWNTs gave the emission spectra presented in Figure 2b showing PL arising
from mobile (E11) and trapped (E11*) excitons at ∼999 and ∼1161
nm, respectively. At the highest shown defect density, there is an
additional red tail that stretches to 1450 nm and has been attributed
to deeper trap states (E11*–) resulting from different arrangements of aryl moieties on the SWNT
lattice.22,30−32 Note that all emission
features are red-shifted compared to functionalized (6,5) SWNTs dispersed
in aqueous surfactant solutions owing to interaction with the conjugated
wrapping polymer and differences in the dielectric environment.45 Since the PL was collected through an objective,
the NIR absorption of toluene does not affect the spectra as a result
of the extremely short path length within the liquid. As expected,
the E11* PL intensity increases relative
to the E11 with rising diazonium concentration
and, thus, defect density. Below a diazonium salt concentration of
∼0.037 mmol L–1, the E11 and E11* transition energies
depend only weakly on defect density, supporting the picture of well-isolated
sp3 defects. However, above this level, the E11 transition blue-shifts both in absorption and in emission
with further increasing defect density, whereas the E11* transition red-shifts. The origin of these opposing
spectral shifts is currently not well-understood, but it may provide
an interesting starting point for future computational studies. The
spectral shifts are more pronounced in absorption than in emission,
and this difference is reflected clearly in the Stokes shifts (see Figure 2c). The untreated
(6,5) SWNTs exhibit an E11 Stokes shift
of 6 meV that reaches 11 meV for highly functionalized samples. Conversely,
the E11* Stokes shift drops from 18 to
14 meV as the defect density increases.

The small E11 Stokes shift originates from the rigidity of the SWNT
structure (i.e., small reorganization energy) in combination with
the delocalized nature of the E11 exciton.46 In contrast to that, quantum chemical calculations
predict a significant distortion in the vicinity of an sp3 defect upon exciton trapping.21,26,47,48 At low defect densities the observed E11* Stokes shift is ∼3 times larger than
that associated with the E11 exciton.
Generally, we find Stokes shifts from 18 to 21 meV depending on the
substituent on the aryl group (see Supporting Information, Figure S3). Following the assignment of the E11* transition in (6,5) SWNTs to the ortho++ defect binding configuration30 (equivalent to ortho L90 in ref (22)), the experimentally measured E11* Stokes
shift for 4-Br-phenyl defects is almost an order of magnitude smaller
than predicted by calculations (18 vs ∼140 meV).22 Even though part of this discrepancy might result
from imperfect energy scaling in the quantum chemical calculations,49 it is unlikely to be the sole origin. Further,
the range of reorganization energies (20 to 120 meV) extracted from
temperature-dependent PL measurements via a model
involving vibrational reorganization upon exciton trapping is well-above
our measured E11* Stokes shifts.47 This mismatch suggests that the relationship
between the optical trap depth given by the energy difference between
the E11 and E11* transition and the thermal detrapping energy might be more complex
than previously assumed. Nevertheless, the general trend in E11* Stokes shifts reflects the reported behavior
of reorganization energies.47 Both quantities
decrease as a function of defect density, most likely due to site-to-site
interactions and associated electronic state delocalization.47Figure S4 (Supporting
Information) summarizes the PL spectra obtained for (6,5) SWNTs functionalized
with other aryl defects bearing more electron-withdrawing (4-nitro
and 3,5-dichloro) or electron-donating (4-methoxy) substituents. Note
that all PL spectra are normalized to the E11 intensity, and thus no conclusions about the relative PLQYs can
be drawn from these spectra alone.

Defect Density Metrics
An important experimental consideration
is whether the density of the created defects scales linearly with
the reagent concentration. Hence, we recorded Raman spectra of the
functionalized SWNTs and determined the intensity of the D mode, which
is expected to be proportional to the density of symmetry-breaking
sp3 defects,50 relative to the
G+ mode, which is a measure of the density of sp2 carbon atoms in the probed spot (Supporting Information, Figure S5). Similar to the functionalization
process in an aqueous environment,18 we
find a roughly linear relationship between the D/G+ ratio
and the diazonium concentration (Figure 3a). In addition to this linearity, we observe
that the reagent concentration window across which defect luminescence
is detectable in organic solvent spans 3 orders of magnitude. In water
this range is only 1 order of magnitude and occurs at much lower concentrations.18 While this aspect is simply the result of the
lower reactivity of the diazonium species in organic media, it is
highly beneficial in practical terms, as it facilitates precise tuning
of the defect density.

(6,5) SWNTs

Integrated E11*/E11 PL ratio vs integrated E11*/E11 absorbance ratio for different excitation
densities and linear fits to the data.

In addition to the D/G+ ratio of the Raman signals,
the ratio of E11* to E11 absorption was evaluated after background subtraction51,52 and plotted as a function of the diazonium concentration (Figure 3a). The correlation
is roughly linear at low defect levels, but it becomes sublinear at
high levels. This dependence might be explained by assuming the oscillator
strengths (per carbon atom) of pristine and functionalized regions
in a one-dimensional (1D) lattice to be constant at low defect densities.
In this case, defect creation reduces the number of carbon atoms contributing
to E11 absorption, whereas E11* absorption increases by an increment. Then, the E11*/E11 absorbance
ratio is given by , with fd and fp as the oscillator
strengths of defective and
pristine lattice regions, respectively; Nd denotes the number of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms, and N indicates the total number of carbon atoms in the lattice.
For low defect densities, that is, Nd ≪ N, this geometric model predicts an approximately linear
dependence in agreement with the experimental data. However, at high
defect densities, a superlinear increase would be expected, which
contradicts the measured sublinear behavior. This difference is likely
caused by a drop in oscillator strength of the defects once they start
clustering. Computational studies have already revealed the strong
impact of the addition pattern around the aryl moiety on the oscillator
strength of optical transitions.21,22 Furthermore,
this trend is in agreement with the limiting case of a fully functionalized
SWNT, for which all transitions vanish, and only a scattering background
remains.53

On the basis of these
different metrics for the sp3 functionalization
level, it is possible to test their relation to the emission properties
of (6,5) SWNTs, in particular, the integrated E11*/E11 PL ratio. This ratio is
plotted as a function of the diazonium concentration, the Raman D/G+ ratio, and the E11*/E11 absorbance ratio in the Supporting Information, Figure S6. All graphs show a roughly linear correlation
with the best fit found for the E11*/E11 PL ratio versus the E11*/E11 absorbance ratio. Importantly,
even though the E11*/E11 PL ratio is frequently used itself as a measure of
defect density,27,47 it is only meaningful for a given
excitation power density owing to the nonlinear behavior of both E11 and E11* emissions.
While PL from mobile excitons saturates at high excitation power due
to exciton–exciton annihilation,54,55 the saturation
of defect emission has been attributed to state-filling due to the
fast exciton diffusion to trap sites (∼10 ps) and the long
lifetimes of localized excitons (∼200 ps).56 Since defect emission generally saturates at lower excitation
power than E11 emission, the E11*/E11 PL ratio decreases
as a function of pump power (see Supporting Information, Figure S7a,b). As shown in Figure S7c, PL spectra collected under lamp excitation (∼1
mW cm–2) are strongly dominated by defect emission.
The impact of the power dependence on the correlation between E11*/E11 PL ratio
and E11*/E11 absorbance ratio can be seen in Figure 3b, where the slope of the linear fit changes
with excitation power.

In summary, the Raman D/G+ ratio and the E11*/E11 absorbance ratio can
be used as metrics for the sp3 defect density of functionalized
polymer-wrapped SWNTs. The E11*/E11 PL ratio should only be used as a measure
of functionalization for a known and fixed excitation power, and care
should be take when comparing data from different experiments.

Photoluminescence
Quantum Yields and Lifetimes
One
of the main reasons to create luminescent sp3 defects in
SWNTs on a large scale is the goal to substantially increase their
typically low PL quantum yields, that is, the ratio of emitted to
absorbed photons, for practical applications. In the following we
investigate the effect of sp3 defects on the PL quantum
yield of polymer-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs. At this point, it must be emphasized
that the functionalization level that maximizes the PLQY of the ensemble
of functionalized SWNTs is not necessarily the one that leads to the
most efficient radiative relaxation at an individual trap site. The
efficiency of exciton trapping and competition with diffusive contact-quenching
are equally important. In other words, even if very low defect densities
on the order of ∼1 defect per nanotube support radiative relaxation
of trapped excitons with the highest efficiency (i.e., emitted photons
per trapped excitons),28,31 they will not be able to compete
with diffusive contact-quenching given the estimated quenching site
densities on SWNTs of ∼9 μm–1.57

Here, we aim to understand how the PLQY
of an ensemble of functionalized SWNTs is affected by the defect density,
the substituent on the aryl group influencing the trap depth and the
dispersion method, that is, quality and length of the SWNTs. To address
these points without the uncertainties associated with the use of
a reference fluorophore,58 the PLQY was
determined directly by measuring the laser absorption at the E22 transition and PL emission of the sample
in an integrating sphere (absolute method as demonstrated previously).9 Since the PLQY, especially of the defect state,
is a function of the excitation power density due to the nonlinear
behavior discussed above, we note that all measurements were performed
under pulsed excitation (pulse width ∼6 ps) with an energy
density of ∼1.5 nJ cm–2. As discussed in
the Supporting Information, interaction
between multiple excitons can be safely neglected at these extremely
low pulse energies.

Figure 4a shows
the evolution of the total PLQY as well as the spectral contributions
of the main peaks, namely, E11 and E11*, for shear-mixed (6,5) SWNTs functionalized
with 4-nitrophenyl defects. Corresponding graphs for other substituents
can be found in the Supporting Information, Figure S8. Note that, unlike SWNTs in aqueous dispersions, polymer-wrapped
(6,5) SWNTs already exhibit quite good PLQY values of up to 2.4%.9 After functionalization, even low defect densities
lead to a sharp drop of E11 PLQY and the
emergence of strong E11* emission. At
0.037 mmol L–1, a local maximum in PLQY versus diazonium
concentration is observed, at which the E11 still has an efficiency of 1.1%, but the E11* already contributes an additional 2.5%. This range of defect
density could be favorable when elevated PLQYs are needed, but trap
sites should be well-isolated. We note that this maximum might be
less pronounced for SWNTs with higher initial quenching site density
and, thus, lower starting levels of E11 PLQY.

Figure 4 (a) Spectral contributions to the PLQY vs concentration of 4-nitrobenzenediazonium
tetrafluoroborate as a measure of defect density. Solid lines are
guides. (b) Optimum PLQYs found for different substituents as a function
of their optical trap depth. The corresponding substituents—in
order of increasing optical trap depth—are 4-OMe (blue), 3,5-Cl2 (green), 4-Br (orange), and 4-NO2 (red). The gray
shaded areas represent the typical ranges of E11 and total PLQY of pristine (6,5) SWNTs dispersed by shear
force mixing. (c) Lifetime components (τ) extracted from a biexponential
fit to the time-resolved PL decay as a function of the optical trap
depth. Note that PLQY and lifetime measurements were performed on
the same samples.

At a diazonium salt concentration
of 0.37 mmol L–1, the PLQY of the defect emission
peaks at 3.5% with a total PLQY
of 3.8%. Hence, more than 90% of photons are emitted through the defect
channel. This scenario leads to the highest E11* and total PLQY observed in this concentration series. As
the number of defects rises further, the E11 contribution converges to zero, but the E11* emission efficiency decreases as well. This observation is in agreement
with the negligible PL found for highly functionalized SWNTs.59 The outlined PLQY evolution of functionalized,
polymer-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs agrees qualitatively with the trends for
PL intensities of surfactant-dispersed (6,5) SWNTs in water decorated
with the same type of aryl defects.18 In
analogy to the 4-nitrophenyl (4-NO2) case, the optimum
reagent concentrations yielding the maximum PLQY were identified for
the other substituents (Supporting Information, Figure S8). As expected from the reactivity pattern, only
0.037 mmol L–1 of the electron-poor and very reactive
3,5-dichloro (3,5-Cl2) reagent were required, as opposed
to 3.7 mmol L–1 of the electron-rich 4-methoxy (4-OMe)
compound. The 4-bromo (4-Br) reagent has a medium reactivity, and
0.37 mmol L–1 was found to be optimal for maximum
PL.

In Figure 4b the
maximum E11* and total PLQYs are plotted
as a function of the optical trap depth of the substituted aryl defect,
that is, the difference between the E11 and E11* PL emission energies calculated
from Figures 2b and S4 and listed in Table 1. Even though the substituent on the aryl
group modulates the optical trap depth by no more than ∼10%,
it has a strong impact on the maximum PLQY. Evidently, both E11* and total PLQY increase with the optical
trap depth. Furthermore, the deeper the trap, the smaller the residual E11 contribution (i.e., difference between total
and E11* PLQY).

This
trend is best discussed in combination with an analysis of
the PL decay dynamics. We recorded the PL decay at the respective
peak wavelengths of the E11* emission
using time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and fitted a
biexponential decay to the transients (refer to Supporting Information, Figures S9 and S10 for a representative histogram
and results for all substituents and defect densities). In agreement
with literature,26,27 these E11* PL decays feature a long-lived and a short-lived decay
component (τlong and τshort, respectively)
with comparable amplitudes. The short time constant has been interpreted
as the time scale for redistribution of exciton population among bright
and dark states localized at the defect.26,27 This redistribution period is followed by a slower decay of the
trapped excitons through radiative and nonradiative channels.26,27 Consequently, the longer time constant is critical for the emission
efficiency. Quantum chemical calculations suggest radiative lifetimes
of ∼2 ns for bright trap states,29 but measured lifetimes are a few hundred picoseconds. Hence, recombination
of trapped excitons is still dominated by nonradiative pathways. Specifically,
localization-enhanced multiphonon decay (MPD) and electronic-to-vibrational
energy transfer (EVET) in the liquid phase were proposed as key mechanisms.26,27 The lifetime components found for the samples discussed in Figure 4b are shown in Figure 4c as a function of
the optical trap depth. Note that, as the PLQY is maximized at moderate
defect densities, the lifetimes in this regime should also be the
most reliable, since there is neither a significant residual contribution
from the E11 phonon sideband nor significant
site-to-site interaction.

Similar to the trend in PLQY, τlong is larger
for deeper traps. Recently, it was observed that τlong increases for a given SWNT chirality as longer-wavelength defect
emission is probed.26 It was concluded
that thermal detrapping of excitons was responsible for this dependence,
because longer wavelengths are associated with deeper traps. In addition,
the corresponding time scales on the order of ∼100 ps can compete
with MPD and EVET in most solvents.26 In
our case, the variation of the substituent on the aryl group causes
a variation of the trap depth and, thus, exciton lifetime. The values
for τlong range from 205 ps for 4-OMe- to 257 ps
for 4-NO2-substituted defects and agree well with those
found for similar systems.26,27

Concurrently
to the long lifetime component, the total PLQY rises
from 3.0% to 3.8% with the fraction of photons emitted viaE11* continuously increasing from 81%
to 92%. If we assume that we compensated the differences in reactivity
of the various diazonium salts by adjusting their concentrations,
all samples compared in Figure 4b,c should have similar defect densities. With this assumption
we can attribute the substituent dependence of PLQY to the changes
in trap depth, which affects the rate of thermal detrapping. The loss
of defect state population suppresses the E11* PLQY, and the detrapped mobile E11 excitons
are either quenched or decay radiatively, thereby increasing the E11 PLQY, in accordance with the trend in Figure 4b. As the trap depth
appears to be one of the factors limiting the PLQY in this study,
the design of divalent dopants that could bind to the SWNT in an arrangement
creating deeper traps is a promising route to even brighter SWNTs.23,36

Length Dependence of PL Brightening
Apart from the
parameters discussed above, the defect density and trap depth, we
find the PLQY to depend strongly on the quality of the initially dispersed
SWNTs. To illustrate the variation of the PLQY in the starting material
(shear-mixed, PFO-BPy-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs), the typical range is indicated
in Figure 4b. A similar
degree of batch-to-batch variation is observed in sp3-functionalized
(6,5) SWNTs with individual samples reaching total PLQYs up to 4.3%
and others less than 3%. The general variation in SWNT dispersion
quality is governed by many factors including the degree of mechanical
damage of the SWNTs, coverage by dispersant, humidity, and temperature.
In the following, we discuss the role of tube length and initial exciton
quenching site density on the PL brightening upon sp3 functionalization.
We are particularly interested in this aspect with regard to the discrepancy
between the twofold PLQY enhancement observed here and previous reports
of 5- to 10-fold brightening of (6,5) SWNTs that were dispersed in
aqueous surfactant solution by tip sonication and sorted by gel chromatography.18 Because of the harshness of tip sonication,
the dispersed SWNTs are much shorter (average lengths of 350–700
nm)26,60 than shear-mixed SWNTs with average lengths
of ∼1.7 μm.9

In addition
to nanotube ends many types of sidewall defects also act as exciton
quenching sites, thus promoting nonradiative relaxation and decreasing
the PLQY depending on the dispersion method.9,14 To
investigate the effect of higher quenching site densities (before
any diazonium treatment) on the optical properties of the SWNTs after
sp3 functionalization without compromising the chiral purity
of the sample, we shortened presorted, shear-mixed (6,5) SWNTs by
tip sonication. The degree of nanotube shortening was controlled by
the duration of ultrasonication. The length distributions of the shear-mixed
stock and tip-sonicated nanotube batches are provided in the Supporting
Information, Figure S11. Atomic force microscopy
statistics reveal that the average length drops from 1.7 μm
in the shear-mixed stock to 0.5 μm after the longest sonication.
As shown in Figure 5a, the reduction in SWNT length leads to a significant decrease in
PLQY from 1.6% to 0.7%. We find that short sonication times that result
in marginal reductions of tube length still strongly affect the PLQY,
which is most likely due to the creation of sidewall defects. After
the shortening step, each batch was treated with the optimized concentration
of 4-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (0.37 mmol L–1) to produce (4-bromophenyl) sp3 defects. Note that the
shortening and functionalization steps were performed in this order
to account for reactivity differences in SWNTs with more or less damaged
conjugated lattices. In this way, we mimic the scenario of starting
materials dispersed under harsh conditions.

(6,5) SWNTs in toluene as a function
of the average nanotube length. (b) PLQY (black ●) after functionalization
(final) with 4-bromo-benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate vs PLQY before
functionalization (initial). The brightening factor (red ●)
is defined as the ratio of final PLQY/initial PLQY. Solid lines are
guides.

In Figure 5b, the
spectrally integrated PLQY of sp3 -functionalized (6,5)
SWNTs is plotted versus the initial PLQY of the corresponding batch
of pristine polymer-wrapped SWNTs. It is evident that higher initial
PLQYs also lead to higher postfunctionalization PLQYs, which may be
seen as the result of more efficient channeling of excitons to defect
sites owing to a reduced probability of contact-quenching. However,
the relative brightening, which we define as the ratio of final PLQY/initial
PLQY, consistently follows an inverse trend. While the shortest SWNTs
with low initial PLQY exhibit a ∼2.5-fold brightening, the
longest SWNTs are only brightened by a factor of ∼1.5.

In summary, while high-quality functionalized SWNTs feature the
highest absolute PLQYs, the degree of brightening is higher for lower-quality
SWNTs. This observation is in agreement with the recent demonstration
of photoluminescence from ultrashort and usually dark SWNTs by emissive
trap sites.34 As SWNTs with large numbers
of nonradiative quenching sites will never display efficient E11 emission due to fast exciton diffusion and
contact quenching,14,61 sp3 defects allow
a fraction of the exciton population to be harvested that otherwise
would decay nonradiatively. The remaining discrepancy between our
observed 2.5-fold brightening and the 7-fold brightening previously
reported18 for aqueous dispersions of (6,5)
SWNTs with the same defect type likely stems from two factors. First,
the surfactant-dispersed SWNTs were even shorter on average60 than the shortest batch studied in this work.
Second, polymer-wrapped SWNTs usually have higher PLQYs than surfactant-stabilized
SWNTs due to a higher degree of debundling and stronger dielectric
shielding.62 Untreated SWNTs dispersed
in water suffer from faster nonradiative decay, which is alleviated
by defect-induced exciton localization, as this precludes diffusive
sampling of the dielectric environment.29 In polymer-wrapped SWNTs, however, the contrast between both cases
should be smaller; thus, functionalization results in a lower PLQY
enhancement.

PLQY and Brightening of SWNT Films
If sp3 functionalization is to be used to improve the
quantum efficiency
of SWNTs in light-emitting devices, it is crucial that the PLQY enhancement
(relative to pristine SWNTs) is retained in a film with intertube
and substrate interactions. The localization of excitons might even
reduce the large PLQY drop from SWNT dispersions to thin films, which
would be highly desirable. However, suitable deposition techniques
for homogeneous films with defined thickness over large areas are
required to reliably investigate and compare the thin-film photoluminescence
and PLQY of functionalized versus pristine polymer-wrapped SWNTs.
To achieve this, we scaled up the functionalization process to reaction
volumes of several hundred milliliters containing a total mass of
∼0.5 mg of highly enriched, polymer-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs. Following
our standard procedure, we tuned the defect density to the desired
level corresponding to the maximum PLQY as determined above. Next,
concentrated inks of functionalized and pristine SWNTs were prepared
and used for aerosol-jet printing, which is an efficient method to
deposit thick films in a controlled and spatially confined way.63,64 The low to moderate numbers of sp3 defects introduced
to the (6,5) SWNTs do not affect the colloidal stability or viscosity
of the nanotube ink to an extent that would require adjustment of
printing conditions. Hence, both pristine and functionalized (6,5)
SWNTs were deposited under identical conditions. We printed four pairs
of stripes (for comparison of pristine and functionalized SWNTs) with
increasing thickness, all of them being visible with the bare eye.
Currently, there is no deposition technique for aqueous SWNT dispersions
that enables the formation of comparably homogeneous, dense, and large-area
films, except filtration.65 For a comparison
of PL intensities, the respective stripes must be equally thick. Mapping
of the Raman G+ mode intensity confirmed that the stripes
of each pair indeed have very similar thicknesses. With similar numbers
of emitters, the PL intensity under identical excitation conditions
can be used as a relative measure of PLQY. To achieve a direct comparison,
the laser excitation spot was expanded to homogeneously illuminate
a pair of printed stripes, and the PL was imaged onto a two-dimensional
(2D) InGaAs camera. The resulting PL images of all printed stripes
are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S12, together with the integrated Raman intensity and brightfield
optical microscope images. The stripes of functionalized SWNTs are
consistently brighter than the reference stripes. Careful analysis
of the PL intensity as a function of film thickness shows that the
films of functionalized SWNTs are on average a factor of 1.7 brighter
than films of pristine SWNTs (see the Supporting Information, Figure S13). The PL micrograph of the thickest
pair of stripes is shown in Figure 6. Clearly, the emission intensity of defect-functionalized
SWNTs is higher. Subsequently, a grating was inserted to spectrally
disperse the PL emission along one coordinate. The corresponding hyperspectral
image is given next to the real-space image in Figure 6. The strong PL of the functionalized stripe
originates from E11* emission. Further,
the asymmetry of the E11 feature in contrast
to the peak shape of the E11* illustrates
that, apart from differences in the PLQY, the E11 emission suffers from significant self-absorption due to
the small Stokes shift, whereas the E11* is nearly reabsorption-free.60

and hyperspectral image of printed stripes of pristine
and 4-bromophenyl-functionalized PFO-BPy-wrapped (6,5) SWNTs on glass
recorded under continuous wave excitation at 640 nm.

As a complementary test of enhanced emission efficiencies
in films,
we also spin-coated thin films of both samples with areas of ∼1
cm2 and measured the absolute PLQY in an integrating sphere
in analogy to the liquid samples. Despite low emission intensities,
the measurement was reproducible, and PLQYs of 0.18 ± 0.05% for
the reference and 0.31 ± 0.06% for the sp3-functionalized
sample were found. The corresponding brightening factor of 1.7 matches
the enhancement of PL intensity from the printed stripes exactly.
Although the PL enhancement is not larger than in dispersion, it is
at least retained for thin and thick functionalized SWNT films.

Conclusions
We have presented a simple and scalable phase-transfer
reaction
scheme for the functionalization of polymer-wrapped SWNTs with luminescent
sp3 defects in organic nonhalogenated solvents based on
aryldiazonium chemistry. As a result of the high monochiral purity
and concentration of the functionalized nanotube dispersions, we were
able to unambiguously identify the E11* absorption of the sp3 defects and found E11* Stokes shifts of ∼20 meV at low defect densities.
We determined the absolute PLQY of the sp3-functionalized
(6,5) SWNTs in dispersion and probed its dependence on defect density
and trap depth. Careful tuning of the defect density gave PLQYs of
up to 4% with ∼90% of photons emitted through the defect channel.
The length and quality of the as-dispersed SWNTs strongly affected
both the absolute PLQY and the relative brightening factor upon introduction
of luminescent defects. While long SWNTs with high initial PLQY also
gave the highest postfunctionalization PLQY, the greatest relative
brightening was found for the shortest nanotubes with the lowest initial
PLQY. The presented method to functionalize polymer-wrapped SWNTs
with sp3 defects on a large scale in organic solvents further
enabled the fabrication of homogeneous thin and thick nanotube films
with bright and nearly reabsorption-free emission. While we only employed
PFO-BPy-wrapped (6,5) nanotubes in this study, we presume that the
general method can be applied likewise to other nanotube species with
different wrapping polymers. The reproducible and large-scale sp3 functionalization of highly purified polymer-sorted semiconducting
SWNTs will enable the fabrication of brighter carbon nanotube-based
NIR emitting devices such as light-emitting diodes and field-effect
transistors.

Methods
Selective Dispersion
of (6,5) SWNTs
As described previously,9 (6,5) SWNTs were selectively extracted from CoMoCAT
raw material (Chasm Advanced Materials, SG65i-L58, 0.38 g L–1) by shear force mixing (Silverson L2/Air, 10 230 rpm, 72
h) and polymer-wrapping with PFO-BPy (American Dye Source, Mw = 40 kg mol–1, 0.5 g L–1) in toluene. Aggregates were removed by centrifugation
at 60 000g (Beckman Coulter Avanti J26XP centrifuge)
for 90 min and subsequent filtration (poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)
syringe filter, 5 μm pore size).

Shortening of (6,5) SWNTs
Dispersions in toluene obtained
from shear force mixing were tip-sonicated (Sonics, Vibracell VXC-500)
using a tapered microtip at 35% amplitude with 8 s on, 2 s off pulses
at 5 °C for 4.5–23 h to produce different degrees of nanotube
shortening. The sonicated dispersions were centrifuged at 60 000g for 45 min, and the supernatant was used for analysis.

sp3 Functionalization
PFO-BPy-wrapped (6,5)
SWNTs were covalently functionalized with a series of commercially
available diazonium salts (4-bromo-, 4-methoxy-, 4-nitro-, and 3,5-dichlorobenzenediazonium
tetrafluoroborate, Sigma-Aldrich). For a detailed protocol, refer
to the Supporting Information. Reactions
were performed at a (6,5) SWNT concentration of 0.36 mg L–1 (corresponding to an E11 absorbance
of 0.2 for 1 cm path length)66 in an 80:20
vol-% toluene/acetonitrile mixture. Briefly, a toluene solution of
18-crown-6 (18-crown-6, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the as-prepared
SWNT dispersion such that the 18-crown-6 concentration after addition
of all other components was 7.6 mmol L–1. The diazonium
salt was dissolved in acetonitrile, and an appropriate volume of this
solution was added to the reaction vessel. After thorough mixing and
a waiting period of 5 min, a solution of potassium acetate (KOAc)
in 80:20 vol-% toluene/acetonitrile and 7.6 mmol L–1 18-crown-6 was added to the mixture to yield a KOAc concentration
of ∼1 × 10–9 mol L–1. The reaction proceeded at room temperature in the dark; stirring
was not required. After typically 16 h, the mixture was passed through
a PTFE membrane filter (Merck Millipore, JVWP, 0.1 μm pore size)
to collect the SWNTs. The filter cake was washed with acetonitrile
and toluene to remove unreacted diazonium salt and excess polymer.
Finally, the filter cake was redispersed in a small volume of pure
toluene by bath sonication for 30 min.

Printing of SWNTs
Pristine and sp3-functionalized
(6,5) SWNTs were printed under identical conditions. Toluene and terpineol
(mixture of isomers, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the dispersion to
adjust the SWNT concentration to 5.4 mg L–1 (E11 absorbance of 3 cm–1) and
the terpineol concentration to 2 vol-%. This ink was used for aerosol
jet printing (Aerosol Jet 200 printer, Optomec) with an ultrasonic
atomizer.63,64 A 200 μm inner diameter nozzle was
used at a sheath gas flow of 30 sccm and carrier gas flow of 25 sccm.
The film thickness was tuned by the number of printing cycles. The
sample stage was at 100 °C to facilitate fast evaporation of
toluene. Residual terpineol was rinsed off with tetrahydrofuran and
isopropyl alcohol.

Optical Measurements
Absorption
spectra were recorded
with a Cary 6000i absorption spectrometer (Varian). Liquid-phase PL
spectra in the low excitation power density regime were collected
with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog spectrofluorometer equipped with
a 450 W xenon arc lamp and a liquid nitrogen cooled InGaAs line camera.
For acquisition of PL spectra at higher excitation densities, a home-built
setup was used. The sample was excited by the spectrally filtered
output of a picosecond-pulsed supercontinuum laser source (Fianium
WhiteLase SC400) focused by a 50× NIR-optimized objective (N.A.
0.65, Olympus). Scattered laser light was blocked by a dichroic long-pass
filter (875 nm cutoff). The PL emission from the sample was dispersed
by an Acton SpectraPro SP2358 spectrograph (grating 150 lines mm–1) and detected with a liquid nitrogen cooled InGaAs
line camera (Princeton Instruments OMA V). For PL lifetime measurements
using a time-correlated single photon counting scheme, the spectrally
selected PL emission was focused onto a gated InGaAs/InP avalanche
photodiode (Micro Photon Devices) via a 20×
NIR-optimized objective (Mitutoyo). The PL quantum yield of dispersions
and thin films was determined by an absolute method as reported earlier.9 Samples were placed inside an integrating sphere
(Labsphere), and the absorption of laser light at 575 nm (E22 transition) as well as the PL emission were
measured by transmitting the light through an optical fiber and coupling
into the spectrometer. Photoluminescence images were acquired using
an imaging spectrograph (Princeton Instruments IsoPlane SCT 320) and
a thermoelectrically cooled 2D InGaAs camera (Princeton Instruments
NIRvana). The sample was homogeneously illuminated with a 640 nm laser
diode (Coherent OBIS, 40 mW continuous wave), and scattered laser
light was blocked by a dichroic long-pass filter (850 nm cutoff).
