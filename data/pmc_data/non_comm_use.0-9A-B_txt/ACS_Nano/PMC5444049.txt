The
covalent addition of ubiquitin to target proteins is a key
post-translational modification that is linked to a myriad of biological
processes. Here, we report a fast, single-molecule, and label-free
method to probe the ubiquitination of proteins employing an engineered
Cytolysin A (ClyA) nanopore. We show that ionic currents can be used
to recognize mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of native proteins
under physiological conditions. Using defined conjugates, we also
show that isomeric monoubiquitinated proteins can be discriminated.
The nanopore approach allows following the ubiquitination reaction
in real time, which will accelerate the understanding of fundamental
mechanisms linked to protein ubiquitination.

Post-translational
modifications
(PTMs) regulate the function of a vast range of proteins in a eukaryotic
cell. The attachment of the small 8.6 kDa protein ubiquitin (Ub) to
a substrate protein (ubiquitination) can affect its fate in many ways,
from signaling its degradation to altering its cellular location or
inhibiting its interaction with other proteins. Ubiquitination is
achieved through the activity of three different enzymes.1,2 First, an ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) activates Ub through
the hydrolysis of ATP. Next, the E1 transfers Ub to the active site
cysteine of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which, with the aid
of an E3 ligase, attaches Ub to a substrate protein, often to a lysine
residue (Figure 1A).

of the ubiquitin cascade. Ubiquitin activating enzyme
(E1) activates Ub through hydrolysis of ATP. Next, the E1 transfers
Ub to the active site cysteine of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2).
E2 can transfer Ub further to one of its lysine residues or, with
the help of a ubiquitin ligase (E3), ubiquitinate substrates (S).

in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5 at −35 mV potential applied
to the trans electrode and recorded using a 2 kHz
low-pass Bessel filter with a 10 kHz sampling rate. Traces were postacquisition
digitally filtered with a Gaussian 500 Hz low-pass filter.

Abnormal concentration of ubiquitin and/or the
precise ubiquitination
of protein substrates are linked to disease. For example, ubiquitin
levels have been observed to increase in cerebrospinal fluid of patients
with Alzheimer’s disease,3 while
ubiquitinated substrates, including E2 enzymes, are directly implicated
in human disease.4 Further, aberrant ubiquitination
of α-synuclein, a protein involved in Parkinson’s disease,
may affect aggregation depending on which lysine residue is modified.5 It follows that the detection of the exact pattern
and position of ubiquitination of a protein substrate is a potentially
useful biomarker for disease onset and progression.6,7

Currently, only ensemble methods that use either fluorescently
labeled ubiquitin8 or substrates9 allow real-time monitoring of the ubiquitination
reaction in vitro. Such methods, however, do not
allow monitoring the entire ubiquitination cascade of E1–E2–E3
or the simultaneous modification of multiple substrates. Further,
since ubiquitination relies on precise interactions between proteins,
fluorescent substrates often alter the kinetics and efficiency of
the ubiquitination reaction.10 Therefore,
single-molecule and label-free methods can enhance our understanding
of the factors that regulate ubiquitination.

Biological nanopores
are powerful tools to study single molecules.
In nanopore analysis, the signal is provided by the ionic current
generated by hydrated ions translocating through the nanopore under
an external applied potential. Molecules entering the nanopore by
either passive diffusion or sustained by the electrical potential
or the electro-osmotic flow are recognized by the specific modulation
of the nanopore current. Nanopores have been used to sense molecules11−14 and to monitor chemical and enzymatic reactions15−18 to study nucleic acids19−22 and folded proteins.23−27 Unfolded proteins might also be studied as they translocate through
nanopores with 1–2 nm of diameter.27−32

The identification of large PTMs such as ubiquitination may
be
achievable directly with nanopores. Using an immobilized DNA-conjugated
model protein Bayley and co-workers showed that phosphorylation, another
PTM, can be identified at different sites in unfolded polypeptides
threading the nanopore.33 However, at the
moment, the unassisted translocation of polypeptides is too fast to
allow the sequence identification of individual amino acids on the
fly. Recently, Meller and co-workers demonstrated the detection and
discrimination of single ubiquitin as well as short ubiquitin polymers
with solid-state nanopores,34 which may
be useful to study length and linkage-type of ubiquitin chains once
removed from a protein of interest. We have shown that folded proteins
can be studied with the biological nanopore Cytolysin A (ClyA).13 Because the 5.5 nm cis opening
of ClyA is larger than its trans opening (3.3 nm, Figure 1B), proteins can
remain trapped inside the nanopore for extensive time (i.e., from milliseconds to hours depending on the size, charge, and shape
of the protein)13 and consequently recognized
by the specific modulation of the nanopore current. In this work,
we investigated the ability of nanopores to detect mono- and polyubiquitinated
proteins. Using an engineered ClyA nanopore, we show that nanopore
currents can be used to discriminate a protein from its mono- and
polyubiquitinated derivatives and to discriminate defined isomeric
monoubiquitinated proteins. Notably, all recordings employed physiological
conditions (Tris-buffered saline buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl,
pH 7.5), sampled native proteins and allowed determining kinetic parameters
of the E1 enzyme by observing the formation of the ubiquitinated E2
protein in real time. Collectively, our data put biological nanopores
forward as a single-molecule tool for the detection and analysis of
protein ubiquitination in vitro.

Results and Discussion
Detection
of Mono- and Poly-Ub Conjugates with an Engineered
Biological Nanopore
To investigate whether ClyA can discriminate
between a protein and its ubiquitinated form(s), we chose the ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme Ubc4 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model protein. We relied on the fact that this E2 can ubiquitinate
itself in vitro.35 Many
E2 enzymes are able to self-ubiquitinate, which might act as a regulator
of E2 activity.36 We employed this behavior
to produce ubiquitinated protein in large amounts. In addition, we
reasoned that the molecular weight of Ubc4 (19.8 kDa) and its ubiquitinated
derivatives (+8.6 kDa) would be suitable for detection with ClyA nanopores
(Figure 1B). We first
added recombinantly expressed and purified Ubc4 (hereafter E2) (Figure S1A) to the cis side
of a type I ClyA-AS37 nanopore (C87A/L99Q/E103G/F166Y/I203V/C285S/K294R/H307Y),
in a buffer containing 500 μL of 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl,
pH 7.5, and applied a transmembrane potential of −35 mV (referring
to the trans or “working electrode”).
The same buffer and applied potential were used throughout this study.
We observed blockades (Figure 1C) with a residual current (Ires%), defined as the ratio of amplitude percent of blocked pore (IB) and open pore (IO), of 72.9 ± 4.5%, with an average dwell time (or τoff) of 39 ± 24 ms (mean ± SD; the mean and SD are
obtained from N = 3 independent nanopore experiments,
(Supporting Information Table 1). To prolong
dwell times and thus potential resolution of isomeric ubiquitinated
substrates, we used an engineered ClyA-AS nanopore where a tryptophan
substituted a glutamine at position 56 (ClyA-Q56W, manuscript in preparation).
Hence, an increased hydrophobic inner surface is created inside the
lumen of ClyA-56W that would allow hydrophobic and electrostatic π
interaction of proteins with the nanopore. Addition of 50 nM E2 to
the cis side of ClyA-56W (henceforth ClyA, Figure 1D and Figure S1B) increased dwell times to 1737 ±
420 ms with similar Ires% of 74.0 ±
0.8% (N = 3), suggesting that E2 interacts with the
inner surface of ClyA near position 56. The average capture rate (kc), the inverse of the interevent time normalized
for 1 μM of analyte, was 21.7 ± 3.6 s–1 μM–1.

In order to obtain E2Ub conjugates,
we performed in vitro ubiquitination reactions. As
a negative control, we performed reactions in the absence of ATP.
In those reactions, no ubiquitinated E2 was produced, as determined
by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Figure 2). Addition of 5 μL of such a reaction
mixture containing no ATP to the 500 μL cis compartment of nanopores resulted in the formation of a single type
of blockade, similar to the E2 alone, with Ires% 75.4 ± 0.3% (N = 3, τoff = 2231 ± 481 ms, kc =
6.6 ± 0.7 s–1 μM–1 (Figure 3A); thus the E1 and
Ub do not produce blockades under these experimental conditions with
ClyA. Consistently, we did not observe blockades when adding E1 and
Ub in the absence of E2 (Figure S2). Therefore,
E1 (molecular weight = 110 kDa) most likely is too large to enter
the nanopore, whereas Ub (molecular weight = 8.6 kDa) molecules translocate
too rapidly through ClyA. In support of this, we previously observed
only very short transient events for lysozymes (molecular weight =
15 kDa).13

recombinant Ub (12 μM), activating enzyme (E1, 0.4 μM),
and E2 (6 μM). Depicted on the right of the gel is the intensity
profile of the in vitro reaction ranging from beneath
E2 to above E2Ub2 with arbitrary absorbance units as determined
with ImageJ (NIH).

(final) of the in vitro ubiquitination reaction described
in Figure 2 (not containing
ATP) to the cis side of the nanopore. (B) Same as
in (A), but the ubiquitination reaction contained ATP. Note that Ub
and E1 do not elicit blockades (Figure S1). Buffer used in all electrophysiological experiments: 150 mM NaCl,
50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5. Data were collected at −35 mV and recorded
using a 2 kHz low-pass Bessel filter with a 10 kHz sampling rate.
Traces were postacquisition digitally filtered with a Gaussian 500
Hz low-pass filter.

When ATP was present
in in vitro ubiquitination
reactions, efficient E2 self-ubiquitination was occurring, as determined
by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Figure 2). The major product of the reaction was
monoubiquitinated E2, but a small amount of E2 carrying two Ubs was
also produced, in line with our previous data.35 When 1:100 dilutions of such reactions were probed with
nanopores, three blockade types were observed (Figure 3B). Blockade B1 (Ires% = 73.9 ± 0.2%, N = 3, τoff = 898 ± 198 ms) corresponds to the E2 alone, as it showed the
same current blocked level observed for recombinant E2 (Figure S1B) and in vitro ubiquitination
reactions lacking ATP (Figure 3A). Blockades B2 (Ires% = 64.0
± 0.7%, N = 3, τoff = 1602
± 626 ms) and B3 (Ires% = 51.8 ±
0.8%, N = 3, τoff = 1930 ±
764 ms) therefore represent ubiquitinated forms of the E2, with B2
likely corresponding to monoubiquitinated E2 (E2Ub) and B3, displaying
a broader distribution of residual currents, corresponding to an E2
carrying two Ubs (E2Ub2) (Figure 3B).

Our labeling of these latter two
species, B2 and B3, rests on two
observations: volume exclusion consideration suggests that deeper
blockades (as determined by a lower Ires% value) should correspond to a larger protein inside ClyA; hence
B3 should represent a larger molecular weight species than B2. Second,
ratios of the nanopore observed blockades (39 ± 2% B1, 46 ±
3% B2, 15 ± 1% B3) match reasonably well with data obtained from
quantification of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2) of the same in vitro reaction (47% E2, 47% E2Ub, 5% E2Ub2). The differences
between the two measurements might reflect different capture efficiencies
between E2 and E2 conjugates and the semiquantitative nature of protein
quantifications from Coomassie-stained gels. Thus, our data demonstrate
that ClyA can directly discriminate between a protein and its mono-
and poly-Ub conjugates.

ClyA Can Discriminate between Two Isomeric
E2Ub Conjugates
We observed that the blockades of E2Ub (and
E2Ub2) of
the in vitro reaction were wider in their distribution
of residual current when compared to those of E2 alone (i.e., the peak is wider, Figure 3B, histogram). We postulated that this may be due to the presence
of isomeric forms of E2Ub. Isolation of the Coomassie-stained band
from SDS-PAGE corresponding to E2Ub, followed by mass spectrometry
(Figure S3), identified three potential
ubiquitination sites on the E2 (lysine residues 35, 39, and 121).
These data confirmed the presence of at least three isomeric forms
of E2Ub in our samples, although their relative concentration could
not be assessed.

To investigate if nanopores can be used to
discriminate between two isomeric E2Ub molecules, we sought to create
well-defined E2Ub conjugates. This was achieved by exchanging the
active site cysteine residue of the E2 for a lysine, creating E2-C116K
(henceforth E2*). Such mutant E2s can accept Ub from the E1 on the
active site (albeit at a reduced rate) but are unable to transfer
the Ub further, creating a homogeneously ubiquitinated E2.38 On a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel, we detected
only a single major upper band (Figure S1A) corresponding to E2* monoubiquitinated on residue 116 (E2*Ub).
Adding 10 μL of in vitro ubiquitination reaction
of E2* to ClyA (1:50 dilution, Figure 4A) resulted in blockades corresponding to the unmodified
E2 (B1, Ires% = 73.5 ± 0.1%, N = 3, τoff = 503 ± 103 ms) as well
as in 30% of the cases extra blockades that displayed Ires% values and dwell times (Ires% = 63.2 ± 0.1%, N = 3, τoff = 2105 ± 600 ms) similar to those of E2Ub conjugates (Figure 3B). To create a second
well-defined E2Ub conjugate, we fused Ub genetically to E2 at its
N-terminus (UbE2) and expressed the construct recombinantly. E2*Ub
and UbE2 were thus isomeric proteins, apart from the active site cysteine
in UbE2 which is a lysine in E2*Ub. It should be noted that the exchange
of cysteine for a lysine did not alter the blockades observed for
E2* and E2 (Figures 3A and 4A). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining
of E2*Ub and recombinantly purified UbE2 (Figure S4) demonstrated that both proteins ran almost identically
on gel, making them virtually impossible to separate by this technique.

Below are the same plots as in A and B shown but with 100 nM UbE2
and 1:50 dilution of an in vitro reaction (thus about
120 nM of E2* or E2*Ub) added to the cis side. Buffer
used in all experiments: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5. Data
were recorded using a 2 kHz low-pass Bessel filter with a 10 kHz sampling
rate. All traces shown were postacquisition digitally filtered with
a 500 Hz Gaussian low-pass filter.

UbE2 (200 nM) showed blockades (Figure 4B) with, on average, similar residual currents
as E2*Ub (Ires% = 62.5 ± 1.8%, N = 3, τoff = 307 ± 126 ms, kc = 16.7 ± 1.7 s–1 μM–1) but wider in their distribution (Figure 4A). Further, the average dwell
time was ∼4-fold shorter than that for E2*Ub, enabling, partially,
the discrimination of both isoforms by plotting the dwell time over
the residual current (Figure S5). We also
noticed that UbE2 blockades displayed a significantly higher SD of
the current amplitude when compared to those caused by E2*Ub. The
signals from the two isomeric species could be reliably separated
by expressing the SD of the amplitude versus the
residual current of the blockades caused by each species (Figure 4C, bottom). Taken
together, our data demonstrate that ClyA can discriminate between
isomeric E2Ub conjugates.

Real-Time Observation of Protein Ubiquitination
under Physiological
Conditions
Our data suggest that the nanopore system can
be employed to observe the kinetics of ubiquitination of E2 in real
time. Using the same physiological buffer mixture as used for analyzing
end-point reactions, we added 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, E1
(26.6 or 5.3 nM), Ub (320 nM), and E2 (160 nM) proteins to the cis side of ClyA. As expected, we observed only blockades
corresponding to E2 from reactions performed without ATP. When we
added 5 mM ATP to the same side, blockades corresponding to E2Ub appeared
almost immediately, with the reaction reaching a plateau after 10–15
min (Figure 5 and Figure S6) when 26.6 nM E1 was present. The dwell
time of E2 and E2Ub was shortened to 356 ± 154 and 528 ±
271 ms (N = 6, combined for reactions containing
either 26.6 or 5.3 nM E1), respectively, most likely to the effect
of MgCl2 concentrations. The observed rate of the reaction
could be obtained by following either the disappearance of E2 blockades
or the appearance of E2Ub blockades (Figure 5B). We used the frequency of E2 blockades
to measure the concentration of E2 in solution (Figure 5C and Figure S6; Methods). The slope of the linear regressions
to the initial rates of E2 disappearance, −10.1 ± 3.9
nM min–1, gave the rate of the loading of E1 with
Ub under hydrolysis of ATP and the transfer of Ub to E2 from the E1
enzyme. As expected for an enzymatic reaction, decreasing E1 to 5.3
nM reduced the rate of the reaction accordingly to −1.1 ±
0.3 nM min–1 (Figure S6). In contrast to in vitro reaction experiments
monitored by gel electrophoresis, even after 3 h, we only observed
very few blockades which could be attributed to E2 carrying two ubiquitin
molecules, an effect most likely due to the much reduced concentration
of reactants used in the nanopore experiments. Taken together, our
data show that nanopores can be employed to follow the ubiquitination
cascade at the single-molecule level in real time.

filter with a 10 kHz sampling rate.

Conclusion
The function of many proteins is regulated
by ubiquitination: the
covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate protein side chains.
Since aberrant ubiquitination has been related to disease,4 the detection of different ubiquitinated species
in biological samples could help monitoring the onset of diseases.
Commonly, gel electrophoresis is employed to detect and separate proteins
in their mono- and polyubiquitinated forms, whereas mass spectrometry
is the method of choice for detecting and characterizing ubiquitination de novo. Such techniques, however, are expensive and/or
require lengthy preparation procedures. In this work, we showed that
a biological nanopore can be employed to resolve protein and protein–ubiquitin
adducts. Using defined monoubiquitin proteins, we could demonstrate
that ClyA can resolve also isomeric ubiquitin-carrying proteins. Therefore,
the ClyA nanopores could provide a low-cost method to monitor aberrant
ubiquitination in a biological sample. However, similarly to all analytical
techniques used in proteomics, the identification of proteins in complex
biological samples will most likely require suppressing the signal
from background proteins. This could be achieved, for example, using
selective binding molecules to enrich target ubiquitinated proteins
near the nanopore mouth,13 while current
recordings will be used to detect and quantify subpopulations of target
proteins.

We also showed that the nanopore system is able to
monitor the
ubiquitination of native proteins in real time under physiological
conditions. In vitro kinetic analysis of post-translational
modifications is often challenging because the covalent modification
of proteins is usually not associated with a change in a spectroscopic
signal. For example, ubiquitination may only be monitored in real
time using the change in fluorescence polarization that follows the
conjugation of a fluorescently labeled ubiquitin to its substrate.39 Labeled ubiquitin, however, may alter affinity
with substrate proteins while the fluorescent signal cannot distinguish
between different ubiquitinated proteins, hence precluding monitoring
intermediates and the E1–E2–E3 ubiquitination cascade.
Crucially, because the signal allows recognition and discrimination
of single proteins, the nanopore approach should allow following reaction
intermediates and the simultaneous ubiquitination of different substrates.
Thus, the nanopore approach could be expanded to follow, for example,
the transfer of Ub from E2 to HECT domain E3s and even to substrates,
following effectively the whole cascade concomitantly. This has potential
applications when measuring the effect of small-molecule40 and peptide41 inhibitors
or binding partners35 of a certain component
of the Ub cascade upon the whole ubiquitination cascade. Also, pathways
that involve ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO, NEDD8, or ISG1542 could be studied with the nanopore approach.
Taken together, here we introduce a nanopore method that is immediately
applicable to follow the ubiquitination of proteins of about 20–50
kDa in size. Solid-state or biological nanopores with wider diameters
might be employed to monitor larger proteins.

Methods
Plasmid
Construction, Protein Expression, and Purification
In this
work, we used an engineered variant of ClyA from Salmonella
typhi, ClyA-AS (C87A/L99Q/E103G/F166Y/I203V/C285S/K294R/H307Y),
as a template for the preparation of a ClyA variant containing a ring
of tryptophan residues at position 56. The rationale behind this is
that a ring of bulky, hydrophobic residues in the nanopore lumen might
promote the target protein to dwell longer in the pore because of
a smaller diameter of the pore and stronger interaction with the lumen.

The ClyA-AS-Q56W variant was prepared according to the MEGAWHOP
procedure.43 Part of the ClyA gene was
amplified using the primer containing the Q56W substitution (forward,
5′-GAATACAGTTGGGAAGCGTCC-3′)
and the T7 promotor (reverse, 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′).
REDTaq ReadyMix (150 μL) was mixed with 6 μM of forward
and reverse primers and ∼400 ng of plasmid template, and PCR
water was added to reach a final volume of 0.3 mL. After a preincubation
step at 95 °C for 3 min, the reaction was cycled 27 times according
to the cycling protocol: denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing
at 55 °C for 15 s, extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting
PCR product was concentrated using the QIAquick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen) and gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. About
500 ng of the purified PCR product was mixed with ∼300 ng of
the ClyA-AS DNA template and the amplification was carried out with
Phire Hot Start II DNA polymerase in 50 μL final volume. After
30 s preincubation at 98 °C, the reaction was cycled 30 times
according to the following cycling protocol: denaturation at 98 °C
for 5 s, extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. The circular template
was eliminated by incubation with Dpn I (1 FDU) for 1 h at 37 °C.
Next, 0.6 μL of the resulting mixture was transformed into 50
μL of E. cloni 10G cells (Lucigen) by electroporation. The transformed
bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C on ampicillin (100 μg/mL)
LB agar plates. The identity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing.

ClyA-AS and ClyA-AS-Q56W contain a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag.
Monomers were expressed in E. cloni EXPRESS BL21 (DE3) cells (Lucigen)
and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described before.37 Oligomers were then formed by adding 0.2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM, GLYCON Biochemicals
GmbH). Type I ClyA oligomers were separated from monomers and several
other oligomeric ClyA forms37 using a blue-native
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE, Bio-Rad). In this work,
we gel-extracted the lowest band, which is likely to correspond to
the 12-meric (Type I) form of ClyA. Aliquots were stored at 4 °C
in 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5 supplemented with 0.2% DDM
and 10 mM EDTA.

The active site mutant form of Ubc4p (E2*) was
constructed using
the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using the
primer pair Ubc4 C-K F (5′-ATCAATGCCAATGGTAACATCAAACTGGACATCCTAAAGGATCAATG-3′)
and Ubc4 C-K R (5′-CATTGATCCTTTAGGATGTCCAGTTTGATGTTACCATTGGCATTGAT-3′).
The plasmid for expressing Ub fused to the N-terminus of Ubc4 (UbE2)
was constructed as follows: UbE2 was synthesized as gBlock DNA fragment
(Integrated DNA Technologies), digested with NcoI and BamHI, and cloned
into NcoI-BamHI cut pET15b. Wild-type and mutant forms of Ubc4p were
expressed and purified as described previously.44 Human E1 (Ube1) was expressed and purified as described
before.45

In Vitro Ubiquitination Reactions
In vitro ubiquitination
reactions were performed
essentially as described previously.44 Reactions
were performed in 25 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, 75 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, containing 0.4 μM E1 (Ube1), 6 μM E2 (Ubc4), and 12
μM Ub (BostonBiochem) with or without 5 mM ATP. Reactions with
wild-type E2 were incubated for 2.5 h at 35 °C with 800 rpm shaking,
whereas reactions of the active site mutant form of the E2 (E2*) were
incubated for 16 h at 35 °C with shaking. For SDS-PAGE and Coomassie
staining, samples were quenched with SDS-PAGE buffer containing 5%
β-mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 min at 95 °C prior to
loading on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel.

Image Densitometry with ImageJ
For
analysis of the
Coomassie-stained gel, the ImageJ function “Plot Profile”
was used. After subtraction of the image background (rolling ball
radius, 50 pixels), a line was drawn across the bands of interest
and the “Plot Profile” function used. The resulting
values were used to create a histogram in Clampfit (Molecular Devices)
where Gaussian functions were fitted and the area under the curve
was used to determine the relative percentages of the peaks.

Electrophysiological
Recordings and Data Analysis
An
aperture of about 100 μm in diameter was created in a polytetrafluoroethylene
film (Goodfellow Cambridge Limited) by applying a high-voltage spark.
After application of a drop (∼10 μL) of a 5% hexadecane/pentane
solution to the aperture and a short waiting period, in order to allow
pentane to evaporate, 500 μL of buffer in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM
TrisHCl, pH 7.5, was added to both sides of the film. A drop of about
10 μL of 10 mg/mL 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DPhPC, Avanti Polar Lipids), dissolved in pentane, was then added
on top of the buffer on both sides. After pipetting up and down, a
folded bilayer formed spontaneously with a capacitance between 80
and 150 pF, depending on the electrophysiological chamber used. Normally,
the capacitance varies only slightly for a given chamber. Experiments
were performed at room temperature (∼23 °C).

Electronic
signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices)
with digitization performed with a Digidata 1440 (Axon Instruments).
A low-pass 2 kHz Bessel filter was applied upon recording with 10
kHz sampling rate. Clampex and Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and Microsoft
Excel were used for recording and data analysis, respectively. For
residual current determination, the single-channel search function
of Clampfit was employed. Contour plots were made with Origin (OriginLab).

Dwell times (τoff) and interevent times were calculated
by fitting exponential functions to cumulative distributions. Numbers
are mean ± SD from at least three independent recordings.

For real-time measurements, E2 blockades were counted in 3 min
intervals with 0.5 min overlaps. The concentration of E2 at any given
time point was obtained by multiplying the fraction of E2 of the total
number of blockades (#E2/(#E2 + #E2Ub)) by the initial concentration
of E2 (160 nM). Origin (OriginLab) was used for linear fittings for
initial rates.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis
The
Coomassie-stained E2Ub
band was excised from gel and submitted for MS analysis. The gel fragment
was washed with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, resuspended
in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and proteolytic treatment was performed
using trypsin. Peptides were extracted with 75% acetonitrile and 25%
H2O (5% formic acid in water) and analyzed by nanoliquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS).46 MS data were analyzed with PEAKS 7.0 software (Bioinformatics
Solutions Inc.).
