Self-replication
at the molecular level is often seen as essential
to the early origins of life. Recently a mechanism of self-replication
has been discovered in which replicator self-assembly drives the process.
We have studied one of the examples of such self-assembling self-replicating
molecules to a high level of structural detail using a combination
of computational and spectroscopic techniques. Molecular Dynamics
simulations of self-assembled stacks of peptide-derived replicators
provide insights into the structural characteristics of the system
and serve as the basis for semiempirical calculations of the UV–vis,
circular dichroism (CD) and infrared (IR) absorption spectra that
reflect the chiral organization and peptide secondary structure of
the stacks. Two proposed structural models are tested by comparing
calculated spectra to experimental data from electron microscopy,
CD and IR spectroscopy, resulting in a better insight into the specific
supramolecular interactions that lead to self-replication. Specifically,
we find a cooperative self-assembly process in which β-sheet
formation leads to well-organized structures, while also the aromatic
core of the macrocycles plays an important role in the stability of
the resulting fibers.

==== Body
Nowadays,
living systems replicate
using complex protein machinery that copies information-rich molecules
such as DNA.1 However, near the origin
of life, simpler molecular self-replication in which molecules make
copies of themselves is believed to be a more relevant mechanism.2−4 Only when exponential growth is achieved, such molecules can outcompete
others for common building blocks leading to survival of the fittest
and extinction of the weakest replicators.5−9 One of the main mechanisms through which exponential
self-replication has been realized is self-assembly of the replicating
species into one-dimensional nanostructures under continuous mechanical
agitation.9−11 While these structures grow from their ends, mechanical
energy can break the fibers into two parts, doubling the number of
growing ends. The capability of the longer fibers to absorb and dissipate
mechanical energy drives the system to a self-assembled state that
can be away from thermodynamic equilibrium.12

In order to fully comprehend the mechanism of self-replication
and guide the design of self-replicating molecules in the future,
we need to understand how and why replicating molecules reach a stable
self-assembled state, while their precursors do not. A well-studied
example of such a system is the functionalized peptide macrocycles
described by Otto and co-workers.9,11,13 We focus on the a pentapeptide (1) with
an aromatic dithiol headgroup (Figure 1) which is oxidized (either by sodium perborate oxidation
or by slow atmospheric oxygen oxidation) to form an interconverting
mixture of macrocycles (a “library”) around neutral
pH through disulfide exchange reactions. For the peptide sequence 1, it has been found that under constant agitation (stirring
of the reaction mixture), the hexamer macrocycle self-replicates driven
by assembly into nanofibers (Figure 1) and, consequently, the concentration of the hexamer
grows exponentially at the expense of other macrocycles (i.e., trimer, tetramer).

Figure 1 Chemical structure of the peptide monomer and schematic
representation
of the system. Eventually, the collection of different macrocycles
(trimer, tetramer, hexamer and other ring sizes) is completely converted
to hexamers with self-assembly as the driving force. For more details
see, e.g., refs (9, 11).

Several theoretical and experimental
methods are able to interrogate
the structural and optical properties of the assembly of replicating
species. Here, we focus on molecular dynamics (MD) and electron microscopy
to study the architecture of the nanostructures, while Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) absorption, UV–vis absorption and circular
dichroism spectroscopy are used in combination with semiempirical
computational methods to understand peptide secondary structure, aromatic
stacking and chirality, respectively.

MD simulations at various
levels of detail are routinely used to
study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules, such as proteins
and lipids. With the recent advances in computational power, simulations
of the properties of large self-assembled bioinspired nanostructures
are becoming accessible.14−24 On the other hand, modeling the optical properties of self-assembled
nanostructures based on MD trajectories is a developing field that
requires different techniques in the different ranges of the light
spectrum.25,26 Considering that the properties that these
structures acquire originate from the collective action of many molecules, quantum chemical techniques that model the
entire electronic structure of the assembly are very computationally
demanding. However, semiempirical methods have been developed to allow
such calculations. Specifically for the determination of the secondary
structure of proteins and peptides, well-tested frequency mapping
algorithms27−29 have been developed to construct the vibrational
Hamiltonian of the system and thus predict the infrared absorption
of all the peptide bonds in a molecule. Interestingly, these methods
are not typically applied to the self-assembly of short peptides,
which make up a large class of biocompatible materials.30 Because of the many identical molecules in a
self-assembled nanostructure, these systems typically represent a
well-averaged ensemble and should thus form an ideal case for the
frequency mapping algorithms originally developed for proteins. In
addition, the structural heterogeneity of supramolecular systems (and
sometimes polymorphism16,31,32) is intrinsically sampled when multiple snapshots from the MD are
considered in higher level calculations.

In the vibrational
signature of the peptide-based nanostructures,
the amide I mode is the most important secondary structure marker,
but in simulations of absorption in the UV and visible range of the
spectrum more than one vibronic excitation needs to be considered
due to the high density of states in systems with many chromophores.
Specifically the absorption of circularly polarized light is of relevance,
as individual chromophores might not exhibit a CD signal, but a chiral
supramolecular organization often induces such a component. Spano et al. have proposed an INDO (intermediate neglect of differential
overlap33) based method to calculate UV–vis
and such supramolecular CD signals from first-principles (both absorption
and emission) and shown its application to 1D aggregates of oligophenylenevinylene.34−36 As it was previously hypothesized that the peptide macrocycles also
form helical assemblies,13 the comparison
of the calculated supramolecular signal with the experimental signal
is a good test for the proposed models.

In this paper, we will
first discuss the results on the nanoscale
architecture of the 1 monomers and fibers made of 16 as observed by MD and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The resulting structure is then investigated
in even greater detail by comparing experimental and computational
spectroscopic data that interrogate specific intermolecular interactions.

Results
and Discussion
Structural Studies Reveal One-Dimensional
Assembly
Libraries of 1 were prepared in two
different conditions.
In the first case, the initial dithiol monomer is oxidized to 80 mol
% using sodium perborate solution. In the second case, the dithiol
is left to slowly oxidize by exposure to air. Both libraries were
confirmed to contain >95% 16 after
2 weeks. TEM images of the library of 1 indicates the
self-assembly of hexamer macrocycles into 1D fibers with a diameter
of 3.4 ± 0.7 nm (preoxidized library) and 3.1 ± 0.5 nm (air-oxidized
library) and a length ranging up to hundreds of nanometers (see Figure 2 and Figure S1, S2). These measurements suggest the
fibers consist of a stack of single macrocycles (cf. Figure 3C). Interestingly,
almost all observed structures in the TEM image of the air-oxidized
library are bundles of two individual fibers with a left-handed helical
pitch of 56 ± 8 nm, which is similar to matured cross-β
amyloid fibrils, which are reported to aggregate by a minimum of two
and had a helical pitch of 85–100 nm.37,38

Water molecules are not shown.

Typically, aromatic peptide amphiphiles assemble into so-called
π–β structures, where the aromatic parts of the
molecule stack via π–π interactions
and the peptide moieties assemble into parallel or antiparallel β-sheets via main-chain H-bonding and side group interactions.30 This is likely to be the case for peptide macrocycles,
so stacking and H-bonding have to occur along the fiber axis, as will
be shown below. Following these constraints, we propose two distinct
conformations based on the TEM observations: the C6-symmetric
“cartwheel” conformation (Figure 3A) where all peptide strands are oriented
in the same direction, or the C3-symmetric “pairwise”
conformation where alternating peptide strands are rotated by 180°
to pair the hydrophobic faces (with amino acids Leu and Phe) of the
peptide strands (Figure 3B). Both parallel39−41 and antiparallel42−44 conformations are commonly
observed among self-assembling short peptides, but since the peptides
are connected to each other via an aromatic moiety
and the fiber width is equal to the molecular dimensions of the macrocycle,
the structures must resemble peptide amphiphiles exhibiting parallel
β-sheets such as those designed by Stupp and co-workers.15,45

We tested the stability of these conformations by MD simulations
and found that both conformations undergo structural changes with
respect to their starting structure (see Supporting Information, Figure S3), but the one-dimensional nature of
the assemblies is maintained at room temperature (Figure 3C–F), although partial
desorption at the fibril ends can occur. Notably, water is immediately
dispelled from the core of the macrocycles leading to the formation
of a collapsed fibril with lower symmetry. Lateral sheet–sheet
interactions stabilize the structure in both conformations, as can
be seen in the Figure 3C,D. Moreover, the relative packing distances of the aromatic core
(parallel displaced stacking with a distance of 3.8–4.2 Å)
and the peptide strands (parallel stacking with a Cα–Cα distance of 4.8–4.9 Å) cause
the structure to form a helical pitch as visible in Figure 3E. Interestingly, simulations
of 16 consistently formed left-handed
helical fibers, while simulations of its enantiomer with d-amino acids consistently formed right-handed helices as can be seen
in Figure S4. Figure S5 displays the result of a simulation of two left-handed helical
fibers forming a possible conformation of a left-handed bundle, indicating
that the correct handedness and pitch (calculated: 46 nm, experimental:
56 nm) for the fibers could be observed in the simulations. However,
as there are multiple ways to construct the bundle of fibers and this
significantly increases the computational cost of all calculations,
we focus on the single fibers in this manuscript for our calculations.
All data experimental pertaining to the double fibers of 16 can be found in the Supporting Information.

The cartwheel conformation is
stabilized by salt-bridges between
the NH3+ groups of Lys3 of the pentapeptides
and the C-termini of the neighboring β-sheet (Figure 3C), while the side chains of
Lys5 point into the solution. Leucine and phenylalanine side chains
are efficiently shielded from the solvent, except from partial interfaces
at the top and bottom of Figure 3C, which could lead to fiber bundling as observed in
the TEM image. For the pairwise conformation, all lysine side chains
are solvated and the Leu and Phe side chains are mostly buried in
the hydrophobic “zipper” (Figure 3D,F).

The relative contributions to
the stability of the assembly from
the aromatic core and the peptides were determined using umbrella
sampling simulations as complete binding events were not observed
during unbiased simulations. An unbinding trajectory was first generated
by pulling a single hexameric macrocycle consisting of only the peptide
headgroups truncated at the first amide bond (see Figure S6) from a short stack of either 8 or 2 hexameric headgroups.
This trajectory was divided into so-called windows where the centers
of mass of the cycle were 0.12 nm apart along the unbinding direction.
Sampling the conformational space for 10 ns in the 36 windows thus
generated and combining the trajectories using the weighted histogram
analysis method (WHAM)46 resulted in a
binding free energy ΔGbind = −70
± 4 kJ/mol for the stack of 8 macrocycles, and ΔGbind = −50 ± 5 kJ/mol for the stack
of two macrocycles, indicating a strong cooperative binding effect.
Note that the absolute values of the binding free energies reported
here seem to be overestimated, perhaps due to undersampling of the
conformational freedom of the macrocycles in solution.

Interestingly,
when a similar procedure was attempted for a single
β-sheet of 1 with an acetylated N-terminus instead
of the dithiol headgroup, it was observed that this sheet is not stable
at room temperature and spontaneously dissociates within the 10 ns
sampling windows. The binding free energy of the peptides was therefore
calculated using simple counting of dimers in a 1 μs simulation
of two peptides and found to be −12 ± 0.4 kJ/mol per pentapeptide
chain (for details see Supporting Information). The fact that the contribution to the binding free energy of a
single peptide is relatively small is not very surprising as the isolated
peptide is soluble in water without forming aggregates. Yet, the cooperative
assembly of six peptide chains contained in a hexamer can still contribute
up to −72 kJ/mol comparable to the stacking interaction of
the aromatic core. Moreover, the orientation of the peptide chains
appears to be crucial in determining the orientation of the macrocycles
as they stack into a one-dimensional fiber.

The MD simulations
allow us to speculate on the mechanism of self-replication
of one specific size of macrocycle in the experimental library: the
cooperative nature of the assembly and the strong negative binding
free energy for both peptide and headgroup components imply that nucleation
of (especially small) macrocycles into a protofibril is difficult,
but the nucleus, once formed, is very stable. This is in good agreement
with previous observations that stacking is only observed beyond a
certain minimum ring size,13 which depends
on the hydrophobicity of the peptide chain (and therefore on the strength
of the peptide–peptide interactions). If we reverse the unbinding
trajectory observed in the umbrella sampling simulations, we can conclude
that binding of a new macrocycle to the fiber likely occurs via the peptide component first, as the aromatic center
of a single macrocycle is shielded from water as much as possible
by the peptide arms. Unfolding of the single cycle then leads to rapid
attachment. Macrocycles of a different size will not be able to fulfill
all favorable hydrophobic or dipole–dipole interactions and
can therefore unbind again, thus favoring self-replication under dynamic
covalent conditions. Growth via defects in the fiber,
as observed in some other systems,47 is
less likely considering the strongly negative binding free energy
and a previous demonstration of growth from the fiber ends.48 We denote that in our unbiased simulations single
macrocycles could bind loosely to the side of the fibers, which can
act as a mechanism to speed up fiber growth via 1D
diffusion along the fiber to the ends, which will be the focus of
future work.

Optical Properties Confirm π–β
Interactions
As both conformations of fibrils of 16 form very stable nanostructures that match
the dimensions
found in the TEM image, we aimed to find distinctions by studying
their infrared absorption in the amide I region. The absorption frequency
and width of the amide bands is well-known to depend strongly on the
vibrational coupling between adjacent moieties49,50 and can be relatively easily measured experimentally. The experimental
spectrum of monomer 1 (a single peptide strand with aromatic
dithiol headgroup) is displayed in Figure 4A and exhibits a broad absorption centered
on 1642 cm–1 as expected for a well-solvated, unstructured
peptide. An additional contribution to the spectrum is present at
1594 cm–1, attributed to absorption of the C-terminal
carboxylate group, which is deprotonated at pH 8. In comparison, the
experimental spectrum of the stacked macrocycles displays a much narrower
amide absorption red-shifted to 1622 cm–1 (Figure 4B), while the COO– absorption has lost some intensity and has shifted
to 1590 cm–1. These changes in the spectrum are
typical for short peptides self-assembling into β-sheet-like
nanostructures as the amide moieties enter a much more well-defined
hydrogen bonding network51,52 and the pKa of the acid group is dramatically different in the assembled
state, leading to protonation53 or the
formation of strong salt bridges. In all spectra an absorption band
is present at ∼1673 cm–1, which is attributed
to residual trifluoroacetic acid from the peptide synthesis. For clarity
this band has been subtracted to produce the spectra in Figure 4 (raw data in Figure S8).

theoretical
frequencies are red-shifted by 10 cm–1. Two different
conformations (see Figure 3) were modeled. (a) IR absorption of nonassembled peptide 1 in water (AmideIMaps: explicit SPC model, DFT: implicit
continuum model). (b) IR absorption of fibers of 16. (c) UV–vis absorption of single fibers

(f) Experimental and calculated supramolecular CD signal for fibers

To test whether the proposed conformations match the experimental
IR spectra, we used the MD trajectories to calculate the amide I absorption
using a semiempirical vibrational exciton model combining frequency
mapping with transition dipole couplings.54Figure 4A compares
the calculated spectrum of monomer 1 on both the frequency
mapping and the DFT level of theory with the experimental spectrum.
The results of both methods show excellent agreement in terms of position
and line width of the amide I absorption. The DFT result and experimental
spectrum were used to calibrate the vibrational exciton result and
indicated a horizontal redshift of 10 cm–1 needs
to be applied to the frequency mapping results, which is in accordance
with the average shift reported for the frequency mapping method.54 A distinct absorption at 1608 cm–1 is present in both DFT and frequency map results as a consequence
of the proximity of the first amide group to the aromatic ring, which
lowers the absorption frequency. The corresponding area in the linear
experimental spectrum is unfortunately too convoluted to conclude
whether this peak is present (see Figure S8). Note that the COO– band from the DFT calculation
was omitted from the spectrum for clarity (see Methods).

The vibrational exciton calculation on the fibers of 16 accurately predicts the narrowing
and redshifting
of the absorption (Figure 4B), indicating the proposed β-sheet packing is realistic.
The overlap of the experimental spectrum is best with the cartwheel
conformation, although the main absorption of the pairwise conformation
is shifted only by 2 cm–1 and its width is only
3 cm–1 larger, both of which are within the error
of the method. It is interesting to note that a strong but broad band
is still present centered on 1645 cm–1 (see Figure S8), even in the spectrum of the fully
converted library, which is also captured to some extent by the calculations.
This indicates that structural heterogeneities, i.e., disordered or solvent-exposed amide groups are present in both
the experiment and the calculations. The fact that these non-β-sheet
vibrational modes are also captured by the model suggests that these
heterogeneities are to some extent adequately represented in the MD
simulations, although the limited size of the simulation (16 molecules
≈ 8 nm) could contribute and major defects in the fiber structure
may be underrepresented. Interestingly, the spectrum of the double
fibers displays a greater sheet-to-coil ratio (Figure S8), indicating less heterogeneities and disorder,
which shows that slow oxidation leads to more well-ordered β-sheets.

As the calculations can be easily extended to a two-dimensional
IR setup, performing this experiment could give more clarity in distinguishing
the conformations in the future. Note that accurate DFT frequency
calculations on systems this large (∼40 000 electrons)
are currently inaccessible to most computational resources.

To further investigate the supramolecular structure within the
fiber, we have calculated its electronic structure using the exciton
method described above and in ref (34) to compare the UV–vis and supramolecular
CD spectra of the two conformations to the experimental result. First,
the semiempirically calculated spectra were calibrated using more
accurate TD-DFT (CAM-B3LYP/cc-cpVDZ) calculations on 1 and its components. A good overlap was found between the spectra
calculated at both levels of theory and the experiment (see Supporting Information, Figure S9), validating
the use of CIS/ZINDO for the whole macrocycle system, for which the
TD-DFT calculations are too computationally demanding.

Figure 4C shows
a comparison of the experimental UV–vis absorption spectrum
and the exciton calculation of the macrocycle fibers. Although the
quantitative agreement between the calculated and experimental spectrum
is somewhat disappointing, it is clear that the band structure of
the transition is accurately predicted. Analysis of the location of
the transition densities thus allows the determination of the origin
of the various contributions to the spectrum; bands at 295, 238, and
210 nm originate from the ground-to-excited states transitions equivalent
to the transitions to B2u, B1u and E1u states in benzene, respectively, but located on the aromatic core
(see inset in Figure 4C). The first two of these transitions are no longer strictly forbidden
due to symmetry breaking by the amide and disulfide groups. The phenylalanine
ring in the peptide side chain only significantly contributes to the
absorptions at 210 nm and below. Interestingly, it was found that
the bands related to transitions on the aromatic headgroup are sensitive
to the torsional angle of the amide group in both magnitude and position.
Maximum intensity of bands at 310. 248 and 213 nm is achieved with
a CCCN torsional angle around 0 or 180° (Figure S10). These bands are clearly present in the experimental
spectrum, which strongly suggests the first amide bond of 1 is in the same plane as the aromatic ring, prohibiting, to some
extent, H-bonding of the first amide group along the fiber axis. However,
the aromatic rings are also tilted with respect to the fiber cross
section, enabling some H-bond interactions as can be observed in Figure 3E,F. In any case,
the MD results suggest that the flexibility and absence of a side
chain in the first amino acid (glycine) are crucial in enabling H-bonding
along the fiber axis by allowing the rotation of the following amide
groups. This is confirmed by the notably different and unusual location
(compared to common values for peptide secondary structure) of the
glycine [φ, ψ] angles in the Ramachandran plot in comparison
with the other amino acids in the peptide (Figure S11). Interestingly, the headgroup to glycine dihedral distribution
of the cartwheel conformation in Figure S4 displays a clear asymmetry around 0°. This is a mark of the
helicity of the fiber as this distribution is mirrored for d-amino acids and is clearly diminished in the pairwise conformation,
indicating a less chiral structure as can be conveyed from Figure 3D,F. This tentatively
suggests the cartwheel conformation as more realistic: from the TEM
images in Figure 2 a
clear helical arrangement of the hexamer fibers was observed, suggesting
a supramolecular chirality. Note that the UV–vis spectrum for
the double fibers was qualitatively identical (Figure S12).

Previous work has demonstrated the sensitivity
of the electronic
CD signal to peptide sequence and macrocycle arrangement,13 often exhibiting a typical β-sheet signal
with a maximum around 194 nm and a minimum around 214 nm. This absorption
shape was not clearly observed for the stacks of 16 as can be seen in Figure 4D, and as such, while the calculated UV–vis
spectrum proved fairly insensitive to the different conformations
studied, the chiral environment of the macrocycles is considered as
a more promising marker.

The supramolecular component of the
CD signal was extracted from
temperature-dependent CD experiments by extrapolating the change in
ellipticity upon heat-induced disassembly of the stacks (see Figure 4D–F and Methods). Considering the bisignated nature of CD
transitions, the band positions in the supramolecular CD match the
excitation energies observed in the UV–vis spectra of the disulfide
headgroup and phenylalanine (Figure S9),
which suggests the core of the macrocycle fibers is stacked in a chiral
manner, not just on the level of the peptide strands, as seen for
some other aromatic peptide amphiphiles.32 The temperature at which half of the CD signal has disappeared (T1/2, Figure 4E) is 47 ± 2 °C for all bands in the spectrum,
which is in agreement with the umbrella sampling MD results, where
the binding free energy for peptide and aromatic components were found
to be similar. Interestingly, we note that for the double fibers,
even though the room temperature spectrum is qualitatively identical, T1/2 is notably higher (53 ± 1 °C, Figure S13), indicating that the fibers can be
stabilized by bundling without major structural rearrangements, in
line with the lower disordered component in the IR spectrum.

In addition to the experimental CD spectrum, the supramolecular
CD signal was calculated using the excitonic model. Figure 4F shows the overlay of the
calculated (averaged over 10 frames of the MD trajectory) and experimental
supramolecular CD spectrum. As expected for a ZINDO calculation in
vacuum, the calculated spectra are blue-shifted with respect to the
experimental one. To facilitate their comparison, a shift of −0.3
eV was applied to the calculated spectra. The cartwheel and experimental
spectra reasonably match, except at the high wavelength range where
the transitions located on the aromatic core are poorly described.
In this energy range, small changes in the conformation of the aromatic
core, amide and disulfide groups can strongly affect the localization
of the electronic transitions, and thus the CD spectrum. For the pairwise
conformation, its small helicity leads to a rather flat CD signal.
Furthermore, as the calculations were limited to relatively short
stacks of 8 molecules (∼4 nm), it is possible that the calculations
do not consider the right length scale as an origin of the chirality:
from TEM images the period of the helicity of the double fibers was
found to be 56 nm. As the CD signal is extremely sensitive to local
disorder and heterogeneities,35 undersampling
may limit the applicability of the method on larger structures at
this point. In any case, the fact that the CD signal does not match
the archetypal β-sheet signal emphasizes again that care has
to be taken when extrapolating protein database results to short peptides,
especially when other chromophores are present.

The theoretical
methods presented here have not been applied before
to structures that have been self-assembled from randomly dissolved
molecules in solution. The currently achievable time scale of MD simulations
does usually not allow well-ordered structures, such as the structure
in Figure 3, to form
spontaneously. It is therefore possible that the results in this study
miss a certain disordered component (i.e., defects)
in the nanostructures, as suggested by the 1645 cm–1 band in the IR spectrum of 16. While this may cause additional broadening in the calculated spectra,
the results are expected to be qualitatively unaffected as a consequence
of the local nature of the excitonic coupling (both vibrational55 and electronic34).

Conclusions
The nanoscale conformation of self-replicating
macrocycles has
been studied using electron microscopy, spectroscopy, molecular dynamics
and semiempirical quantum chemical calculations. Single and double
fibers can be prepared using fast or slow oxidation of dithiols to
disulfide macrocycles respectively, where bundled fibers are more
stable. The MD, IR, UV–vis and CD spectroscopy results support
π–β-type interactions as the driving force behind
the one-dimensional self-assembly, with approximately equal contributions
from the peptide and the aromatic components to the binding free energy
in the system studied here. The MD results suggest that extensive
hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues in adjacent peptide
chains occur. Furthermore, the simulations in which a ring was pulled
off a stack suggests a mechanism for the reverse process of assembly
(that was too rare to be captured in unbiased MD simulations) in which
binding involves distinct steps in which the individual peptide chains
of the incoming ring align with those in the stack and the aromatic
core of the ring binds to the center of the stack. The multistep and
cooperative nature of the process explains why stack nucleation is
slow while elongation is faster. It also explains why stacks are of
a uniform ring size, as peptide and headgroup alignment requires the
number of peptide arms in the ring to match those in the stack, thereby
favoring self-replication.

MD simulations also strongly suggest
that, in contrast to the schematic
representation in Figure 1 and similar schemes in previous
publications,9,11,13 the aromatic core of the fibrils is collapsed and no water molecules
are located within the core of the structure. The comparison of experimental
data to the IR, UV and CD calculations on two hypothetical supramolecular
architectures obtained from the MD simulations suggests that the “cartwheel”
conformation, with all β-sheets’ hydrophobic faces in
the same direction around the fiber axis, is the most likely supramolecular
architecture, although more advanced experiments such as 2D-IR spectroscopy
or solid-state NMR would be necessary to confirm this.

The semiempirical
exciton methods to calculate IR, UV–vis
and CD spectra from the result of the MD simulations have been applied
to short peptides and their results are shown to be in good agreement
with experimental spectra. These spectroscopic techniques are routinely
used in the study of bionanostructures, but opening up the ability
to link them directly with specific nanoscale architectures greatly
enhances their usefulness in the field. The high level of structural
insights achieved here by combining experimental and theoretical approaches
demonstrates their usefulness to investigate other bioinspired self-assembling
molecules.

Methods
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All MD simulations were
performed using the GROMOS 54a8 force field,56,57 with in-house developed parameters for the aromatic disulfide headgroup
(see Supporting Information for parametrization
strategy). Simulations were started from a straight (achiral) stacked
structure. SPC water58 was added in a layer
of at least 1 nm thickness around the fiber and enough chloride ions
were added to neutralize the system. All explicit hydrogen atoms were
converted to virtual sites and all molecular bonds were constrained
in production runs using the LINCS algorithm,59 except for water molecules which were constrained by the efficient
SETTLE algorithm.60 Additionally, the center-of-mass
motion of the solute (both translation and rotation) were removed
every 100 time steps. After a short minimization of 5000 steepest
descent steps, all runs were performed with time steps of 2.0 fs in
the NPT ensemble using the velocity-rescaling thermostat61 to separately couple the peptide macrocycles
and the rest of the system (water and ions) to an external bath at
298 K with a coupling constant of 1.0 ps. The pressure was kept at
1.0 bar using the Berendsen barostat62 with
a coupling constant of 1.5 ps. A Barker–Watts reaction field
with εRF = 62 was used to treat long-range electrostatic
interactions with Coulombic and van der Waals forces cut off at 1.4
nm. All MD simulations were run using GROMACS 4.6.7.63 Trajectories of 100 ns were generated in two steps: during
the first 50 ns distance restraints with a force constant of 1000
kJ/mol were applied to keep Cα atoms of nearest neighbors
in the other peptide strands at a constant distance of 0.48 nm. These
restraints were then removed for the second period of 50 ns.

Umbrella sampling simulations to determine the binding free energy
of truncated macrocycles were performed on a trajectory created by
pulling the top molecule by its center of mass (COM) from a pre-equilibrated
fibril of either 2 or 8 macrocycles along the fibril axis, while keeping
position restraints (1000 kJ/mol) on all Cα atoms
of the second macrocycle in the stack. The pulling trajectory was
divided into windows with a 0.12 nm COM spacing and an NPT simulation
was performed for 10 ns within each window. The free energy profile
of the dissociation process was calculated using the weighted histogram
analysis method (WHAM) as described in ref (46) with Bayesian bootstrapping for the error estimate.
As truncated peptide dimer stacks were not stable in the simulation,
their binding free energy was determined by counting the number of
dimers (dimers are defined by having any two atoms within a distance
of 0.4 nm) during a 1 μs NVT simulation of two peptides in a
cubic 658 nm3 box of SPC water, pre-equilibrated in the
NPT ensemble for 500 ns. The binding free energy was determined from
the Boltzmann ratio of monomers to dimers as performed in ref (64).

Vibrational Exciton Analysis
Calculations of the vibrational
frequency of all amide groups was performed on the result of a 1 ns
MD simulation added to the end of the simulations described above,
saving the system’s coordinates (including water molecules)
every 20 fs, thus averaging over 50 000 frames. The vibrational
Hamiltonian was created using the AmideIMaps program v1.0.054 with the Skinner frequency map28 and Torii’s transition dipole coupling (TDC),65 as recommended by Bondarenko and Jansen in combination
with GROMOS force fields.54 The NISE2A
program was employed to calculate the linear absorption as determined
by the Fourier transform of the first-order response function.27,66,67 Ensemble averaged spectra were
obtained by evaluating the response functions from 5000 starting configurations
spaced by 200 fs along the trajectories. All spectra were red-shifted
by 10 cm–1 to maximize spectral overlap, in accordance
with the findings of Bondarenko and Jansen for the combination of
GROMOS54a7, Skinner map and TDC. Note that no posthoc broadening was
applied to the results; the width of the calculated spectra is the
natural line width originating from the vibrational motion of the
molecules as sampled by the MD simulation.

DFT Vibrational Analysis
DFT calculations on the zwitterionic
monomer (lysines protonated, C-terminus deprotonated) were performed
using Gaussian09 rev. D.0168 employing
the Grimme’s dispersion-corrected B97-D functional69 with def2-SVP basis set70 to optimize the geometry (using loose convergence criteria) and
calculate the harmonic frequencies. An empirical frequency scaling
factor of 0.965 was applied to correct for basis set truncation and
anharmonic effects and the calculated absorption frequencies were
convoluted with a 12 cm–1 Gaussian line shape function
to simulate the effect of the dynamic solvent environment. Vibrations
located the COO– functionality were omitted from
the result as their frequency is not accurately predicted using this
method (calculated: 1611 cm–1, experimental: 1593
cm–1) and obscures the result, see also ref (51).

UV–Vis and CD Calculations
The geometric structures
generated from the simulation runs above (10 snapshots from the last
5 ns of the simulation for cartwheel and pairwise conformations) were
converted to an explicit hydrogen representation using the default
H–C distances from the CHARMM27 force field.71,72 These full coordinates were used as input for quantum-chemical calculations
at the ZINDO/CIS level of theory using the Gaussian09 program. An
active space of 200 occupied and unoccupied orbitals and the first
500 excitations were taken into account (1000 for a single macrocycle).
The calculations were performed on stacks of 8 molecules (instead
of 16) due to computational memory limitations. The results of these
calculations served in turn as the input for a phenomenological Frenkel
exciton model to predict the spectroscopic properties of the helical
supramolecular structures as described in detail previously.34,35,73 Absorption energies were convoluted
with a 0.10 eV wide Gaussian function. Note that signals <200 nm
are less reliable due to the cutoff at 500 excitations per molecule.
For calibration and comparison, TD-DFT spectra of the monomer (in
the carboxylic acid form) were calculated using Gaussian09 employing
the CAM-B3LYP functional with a coupled-cluster polarized valence
double-ζ basis set. All UV–vis and CD calculations were
performed in vacuum. A redshift of 0.3 eV was necessary to correct
for the absence of solvent and method artifacts as confirmed by calculations
and experiments on various model compounds of 1.

Library
Preparation and Analysis
Peptide 1 was purchased
from Cambridge Peptides Ltd. and used as received
(purity >90%). The libraries were prepared by dissolving the compound 1 (10 mM) in borate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.2). For preparation
of single fibers only, the library was partially oxidized by the addition
of 0.8 equiv of NaBO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, from a 20 mM aqueous
solution). All libraries were left agitated in the presence of oxygen
from the air until the hexamer was the main species (>95%) as confirmed
by UPLC-MS. Immediately after preparation, the pH of the solution
was adjusted by the addition of 1 M KOH solution such that the final
pH was 8.2. All library experiments were performed at ambient temperature.
A small aliquot of each sample was removed to another vial and diluted
20 times with doubly distilled water prior to HPLC or UPLC(-MS) analysis.

The buffer was prepared from anhydrous borax (Fluka) and boric
acid (Merck Chemicals) dissolved in doubly distilled water from in-house
double distillation facilities. Libraries were prepared in clear HPLC
glass vials (12 × 32 mm) closed with Teflon-lined snap caps purchased
from Jaytee. Library solutions were stirred using Teflon coated microstirrer
bars (2 × 2 × 5 mm) obtained from VWR. Samples were stirred
on a Heidolph MR Hi-Mix D magnetic stirrer at 1200 rpm.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
Libraries of 1 were freeze-dried
and resuspended in D2O (99.9%
D, Sigma) to the same concentration (1.7 mM in hexamer) at pD 8.0.
The sample was kept overnight to mature and was then sandwiched between
two CaF2 plates separated by a 50 μm PTFE spacer.
Monomer samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.050 M deuterated
borate buffer at pD 8.0 and measuring within 5 min of preparation
to prevent oxidation of the thiol groups. FTIR spectra were obtained
from an average of 32 spectra on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Series 400
spectrophotometer with a resolution of 4 cm–1. The
resulting spectra were corrected for D2O and water vapor
absorption.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–visible
measurements
were performed using a Jasco V-650 UV–visible spectrophotometer
at 298 K. A quartz cuvette with 1 cm path length was used for the
measurements. The absorption spectra were recorded from 190 to 850
nm at a 200 nm/min scanning rate. Monomer and hexamer samples were
measured at a concentration of 1.0 × 10–5 M
in pentapeptide. It was confirmed the spectra did not change qualitatively
at higher concentrations.

Temperature-Controlled Circular Dichroism
Spectroscopy
Spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectrometer
with a Peltier
temperature controller. Samples were diluted to 5.4 × 10–5 M in pentapeptide were heated/cooled from 283 to
343 K in steps of 1 K (5 K for single fibers) at a rate of 0.1 K/min
and kept for 5 min at every temperature before measuring. Spectra
were obtained as averages of 3 measurements from 190 to 300 nm with
a scanning speed of 200 nm/min and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The spectra
as a function of excitation energy were fitted to Gaussian bands around
6.5, 6.2, 5.8, 5.2, and 4.6 eV using the global fit routine in Igor
Pro with free parameters for the band position, width and amplitude.
Ellipticities as a function of temperature thus obtained were fitted
to a sigmoidal curve to extrapolate the CD signal lost at high temperature,
which equals the supramolecular component of the CD signal. Data points
for which the chi-square of the fit was larger than 100 were considered
not converged and removed from the graph (region λ < 198
nm).

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Samples were diluted
to approximately 0.80 mM using doubly distilled water. A small drop
(∼5 μL) of sample was deposited on a 400 mesh carbon-coated
copper grid (Agar Scientific) and blotted on filter paper after 30
s. The sample was stained twice using 4 μL of 2% uranyl acetate
solution. The grids were imaged in a Philips CM12 electron microscope
operating at 120 kV using a slow scan CCD camera. Fiber widths were
measured at ≥200 locations across 5 images (7 for double fibers),
from the inner layer of the dark contrast layers observed.
