Bladder cancer has the highest recurrence
rate of all cancers due
in part to inadequate transurethral resection. Inadequate resection
is caused by the inability of cystoscopes to detect invisible lesions
during the resection procedure. To improve detection and resection
of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, we quantified the ability of
a surface-enhanced Raman nanoparticle and endoscope system to classify
bladder tissue as normal or cancerous. Both antibody-based (active)
and tissue permeability-based (passive) targeting mechanisms were
evaluated by topically applying nanoparticles to ex vivo human bladder tissue samples. Multiplexed molecular imaging of CD47
and Carbonic Anhydrase 9 tumor proteins gave a receiver operating
characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC of 0.93 (0.75, 1.00).
Furthermore, passively targeted nanoparticles enabled tissue classification
with an ROC AUC of 0.93 (0.73, 1.00). Passively targeted nanoparticles
penetrated 5-fold deeper and bound to tumor tissue at 3.3-fold higher
concentrations in cancer compared to normal bladder urothelium, suggesting
the existence of an enhanced surface permeability and retention effect
in human bladder cancer.

==== Body
With a worldwide
incidence and
mortality of 330,000 and 123,000, respectively, bladder cancer is
a major burden on global public health.1 75% of new cases are stage T1, Ta (non-invasive papillary carcinoma),
or carcinoma in situ (Tis), and these stages are
collectively referred to as nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).2 The standard of care for NMIBC is transurethral
resection (TUR) guided by white light cystoscopy (WLC).3 WLC has several limitations. First, WLC often
results in incomplete resection of NMIBC. For example, one study showed
42% of T1 bladder cancer patients had residual disease in the resection
region 6 weeks after an initial TUR procedure.4 Second, WLC is unable to detect some flat lesions, particularly
high grade Tis lesions, which is an independent negative predictor
of cancer progression.5−10 These limitations are partly responsible for the high recurrence
rate of NMIBC of 60%–70%.3,10 Because improved detection
of cancer could result in lower recurrence rates due to more complete
disease resection,10−12 there is an unmet need for cystoscopy methods that
can detect residual disease during WLC-guided resection.

We
approached the problem of incomplete bladder cancer resection
by developing intravesical surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
nanoparticles that are targeted to bladder cancer. This approach was
motivated by two potential advantages of intravesical SERS nanoparticles
compared to other contrast agents. First, SERS nanoparticles produce
very sharp (<1 nm) spectral lines, which enables multiplexed detection
of up to eight nanoparticle channels.13−15 This multiplexing capability
is in stark contrast with current cystoscopy systems, which can only
detect one fluorescent dye. Given the molecular heterogeneity of cancer,
we hypothesize that multiplexed imaging of many molecular targets
with Raman may enable superior tissue classification compared to imaging
only one target. Second, we anticipate that intravesical nanoparticles
have a higher potential for clinical translation than systemically
applied nanoparticles because of their more favorable pharmacokinetics.16 In particular, a major barrier to clinical translation
of systemically administered SERS nanoparticles is the potential toxicity
associated with long-term sequestration of nanoparticles in the spleen,
bone-marrow, and liver.17 While the toxicity
profile of intravesical gold-silica nanoparticles is currently unknown,
quantum dots instilled into mouse bladder were only observed in extravesical
organs in rare cases and showed no toxicity up to 7 days after instillation.16 We therefore expect that toxicity risks of gold-silica
nanoparticles can be mitigated by intravesical administration, which
has long been used by oncologists to limit systemic exposure of drugs
and imaging contrast agents.16,18,19

For context, Figure 1 describes the eventual clinical use of the SERS nanoparticles
developed
herein.20 A patient presents with a potential
NMIBC, and if diagnosed, a physician recommends them for WLC-assisted
transurethral resection (Figure 1a). Using the accessory channel of the cystoscope,
the physician injects a co-mixture of SERS particles that are either
nontargeted or actively targeted to cell surface targets (Figure 1b). Note that pre-instillation
of nanoparticles does not alter the clinical routine because clinics
performing photodynamic diagnosis pre-instill hexaminolevulinate for
1 h prior to cystoscopy. After pre-instillation, the unbound particles
are washed out of the bladder (Figure 1c). Resection margins and ambiguous regions on the
WLC image are identified and interrogated using a Raman endoscope
(Figure 1d,e). Based
on absolute and relative binding levels, we hypothesize that the nanoparticle-endoscope
system can differentiate cancer (Figure 1d) and normal (Figure 1e) urothelium. The purpose of the current
paper is to test that hypothesis and identify effective nanoparticle
formulations and tissue classification algorithms that can discriminate
normal and cancerous bladder tissue. We believe that accurate classification
of bladder tissue with Raman cystoscopy would improve completeness
of resection and prolong the time to recurrence.

resection guided by WLC. Regions ambiguous on WLC are subsequently
interrogated with Raman endoscopy. (d, e) Based on absolute and relative
binding levels of each channel, flat lesions that are identified,
and cancerous tissue is resected.

Because NMIBC is localized to the bladder lumen, intravesical
nanoparticles
can only target tumor biomarkers expressed on the luminal surface.
One such biomarker is the immunosuppressive protein CD47, which is
upregulated in tumors and interacts with SIRP-α on macrophages
to inhibit phagocytosis.21 A previous molecular
cystoscopy study using quantum dots conjugated to anti-CD47 achieved
cancer detection with a sensitivity and specificity of 82.9% and 90.5%,
respectively.20 Another such biomarker,
CA9, catalyzes hydration of carbon dioxide and is involved in pH regulation.
CA9 was chosen as a biomarker because immunohistochemical analysis
of human bladder cancer biopsies showed that CA9 was expressed on
the luminal surface of 84% and 68% of Ta and T1 bladder cancers, respectively,
but not on normal urothelium.22,23 The rationale behind
also including the passively targeted nanoparticles was two-fold.
First, binding of passively targeted nanoparticles to the bladder
wall serves as an experimental control for nonspecific binding of
actively targeted nanoparticles.24 Second,
because cancer disrupts the urothelial layer that blocks intravesical
compounds from entering the body,20 we
hypothesized that passive binding of intravesical nanoparticles could
be predictive of cancer.

The purpose of this work is to synthesize
and characterize the
SERS nanoparticles shown in Figure 1 and evaluate the relative strengths and challenges
associated with active and passive targeting to human bladder cancer.
Seven ex vivo human normal bladder and eight bladder
tumor samples were imaged using the nanoparticle mixture and endoscope
device shown in Figure 1. We compared the diagnostic performance of three post-processing
techniques and active vs passive targeting in order
to determine the optimal approach for discriminating ex vivo cancer from normal bladder samples. In this paper we show (1) evidence
of passive targeting of intravesical nanoparticles, (2) an enhanced
surface permeability and retention effect for topically applied nanoparticles,
and (3) that bladder tissue can be classified as normal or tumor using
multiplexed molecular Raman imaging. The enhanced surface permeability
effect described herein represents a simple targeting mechanism that
we believe will be useful for both diagnosis and therapy of bladder
cancer.

Results/Discussion
SERS Nanoparticles Actively Target CD47 and
CA9 in Cell Suspension
Figure 2 shows a
schematic representation of the gold-silica nanoparticles used in
this paper. The prefixes s420, s421, and s440 are used to differentiate
SERS nanoparticles with different Raman dyes coating the gold surface.
Each dye is paired with a different antibody, so that binding levels
of each antibody-nanoparticle pair can be differentiated by spectrally
unmixing the three dye signals (see below). The actively targeted
nanoparticles are s420-CA9 and s440-CD47, and the passively targeted
s421-IgG4 nanoparticle is coated with an isotype control IgG4 antibody
that does not actively bind to human proteins. Physiochemical characterization
of all three nanoparticle types is given in Supporting Figure 1.

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the SERS nanoparticles developed
herein.
The Raman dyes were 4,4′-dipyridyl (s420, red dye), d8-4,4′-dipyridyl
(s421, blue dye), and trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene
(s440, green dye). The blue IgG4 nanoparticle is used as a negative
experimental control for active binding of CA9- and CD47-targeted
SERS nanoparticles.

We first used flow cytometry
to validate the specific binding of
fluorophore-labeled SERS nanoparticles to CD47 and CA9 in cell suspension. Figure 3a shows flow cytometry
for cells labeled with s440-CD47, and Figure 3b shows median DL650 fluorescence for flow
cytometry experiments ran in triplicate. As can be seen in Figure 3a,b, compared to
CD47+ DLD-1 cells, CD47– DLD-1 cells exhibited 26-fold less
nanoparticle binding (p < 0.005), labeling cells
with s421-hIgG4 resulted in 25-fold less nanoparticle binding (p < 0.005), and epitope blocking resulted in 8-fold less
nanoparticle binding (p < 0.0001). Similarly, Figure 3c shows flow cytometry
data for HCT-116 cells labeled with s420-CA9 nanoparticles, and Figure 3d shows median DL650
fluorescence for flow cytometry experiments ran in triplicate. As
can be seen in Figure 3c,d, compared to CA9+ HCT-116 cells, CA9– HCT-116 cells exhibited
6-fold less nanoparticle binding (p < 0.005),
and labeling cells with s421-mIgG2b resulted in 8-fold less nanoparticle
binding (p < 0.005). Furthermore, experiments
that varied the available target antigen showed that the level of
nanoparticle binding was proportional to antigen availability on the
cell surface (Supporting Figure 2). These
results suggest that the antibody-functionalized SERS nanoparticles
actively target CD47 and CA9 in cell suspension.

targeting using flow cytometry. (a) Flow cytometry

in triplicate and plotted in a bar graph. (c) Flow cytometry histogram

and plotted in a bar graph.

As can be seen in Figure 3a,c and Supporting Figure 3a, the
isotype control nanoparticles had higher fluorescence than untreated
cells, indicating that nanoparticles were binding nonspecifically
to cells. Indeed, nonspecific binding is a common problem in the field
of nanobiotechnology and is problematic during magnetic isolation
of bacteria, cell lines, and circulating tumor cells.25−27Supporting Figure 3a shows that nonspecific
binding varies by over an order of magnitude as the cross-linker length
and number of antibodies are varied. When a mixture of nontargeted
(mIgG2b) and anti-CD47 antibodies is conjugated to the nanoparticle
surface with a (PEG)77 cross-linker, the ratio of specific
to nonspecific binding increases 2.6-fold compared to anti-CD47 congugated
with (PEG)12 cross-linker. The cause of this reduced nonspecific
binding is currently unclear, but it is likely that nontargeting antibodies
and a long cross-linker alter the surface–surface interaction
between nanoparticles and cells in a way that reduces the nonspecific
stickiness of the nanoparticles. These data suggest that coating nanoparticles
with a mixture of targeted and nontargeted antibodies using a long
cross-linker can reduce but not eliminate nonspecific binding of antibody-functionalized
nanoparticles.

Raman Cystoscopy Enables Multiplexed Molecular
Imaging of CD47
and CA9 in Cell Suspensions
Next we tested the multiplexing
capabilities of the three-nanoparticle mixture (s420-CA9, s421-IgG4,
s440-CD47) by applying the mixture to cells in suspension and imaging
with a Raman endoscope (Figure 4). Four cell suspensions were made that did or did not have
(in each possible combination) the CD47 or CA9 antigen available for
nanoparticle binding. Cells were stained with a 1:1:1 mixture of the
three nanoparticle types, washed, and then imaged.

CD47 and CA9 on cells in suspension. (a)

and background components of the signal. (c) Overlay of the s440,
s421, and s420 channel images on the photograph. (d) Calculated CD47:IgG4
and CA9:IgG4 ratio images overlaid on the photograph.

Figure 4a shows
a photograph of the cells with the four possible combinations of CD47
and CA9 expression. Figure 4b and Supporting Figure 4 show
raw spectra, the least-squares fit (bold red line), and the decomposed
components of the SERS and background spectra (thin colored lines). Figure 4c shows the decomposed
images of each nanoparticle type. Figure 4d shows the active-to-passive ratios of s440-CD47
and s420-CA9 nanoparticles, both normalized on a pixel-by-pixel basis
to s421-IgG4 binding. As can be seen in Figure 4d, the s440-CD47/s421-IgG4 ratio is >2
in
CD47+ cells and close to 1 in CD47– cells, with a similar pattern
for the CA9-targeted nanoparticles. These data suggest that our combined
endoscope/nanoparticle system is capable of multiplexed molecular
detection of both CD47 and CA9 in cell suspension.

The ability
of Raman cystoscopy to detect more than one target
directly addresses a limitation of fluorescence cystoscopes, which
is that they can currently only detect one dye. Given the molecular
and physiological heterogeneity of cancer, it is unlikely that a single
biomarker will be able to identify cancer 100% of the time. One solution
is to develop an imaging system that can detect multiple biomarkers.
Currently available commercial fluorescence cystoscopes only provide
405 nm/635 nm excitation/emission wavelengths for photodynamic diagnosis.
While in theory it is possible to modify endoscopes to detect a broader
range of fluorescent dyes, the relatively broad emission spectra of
fluorescent dyes and the background autofluorescence of tissue likely
make simultaneous detection of more than 2–3 dyes problematic.
SERS nanoparticles could be a solution to this limitation because
the same Raman endoscope can image up to eight nanoparticles with
a single excitation wavelength, and no hardware modifications are
necessary when the number or combination of nanoparticle flavors is
changed.15 Below, we test the hypothesis
that multiplexed molecular imaging is superior to single-target imaging
for classification of normal and cancerous bladder. Further studies
will be needed to compare the effectiveness of fluorescent and Raman
cystoscopy.

Classifying ex Vivo Human
Bladder Tissue Using
Multiplexed Imaging of CD47, CA9, and Passively Targeted Nanoparticles:
Overview of Approach
Next, we topically applied passively
and actively targeted nanoparticles to ex vivo bladder
cancer specimens and quantified their ability to classify bladder
tissue as cancerous or normal. Specifically, the 1:1:1 nanoparticle
mixture and unmixing technique from Figure 4 was applied to N = 7 normal
and N = 8 tumor human bladder tissue samples. Using
this three-nanoparticle mixture, we evaluated three different approaches
for classifying tissue as normal or cancer. The subsequent sections
repeatedly refer to ratios and normalization approaches that are summarized
in Table 1. The three
approaches are analyzed in detail below, but here a brief qualitative
summary is given for context.

For the first approach, we analyze the raw signal
intensity levels
of each nanoparticle type, finding that the passive binding levels
of s421-IgG4 nanoparticles can accurately classify normal and cancerous
bladder tissue (Figure 5). Passive targeting of intravesical nanoparticles has not been reported
previously, and we hypothesize that passive targeting to cancer is
caused by disruption of the urothelium by cancer, which enhances the
tissue surface permeability to, and retention of, nanoparticles. That
hypothesis was supported by experiments showing that the penetration
depth of s421-IgG4 was on average 5-fold greater (Figure 6g), and the binding levels
3.3-fold greater, in tumor than normal tissue (Figure 5c). Those data suggested that cancer induces
an enhanced surface permeability and retention effect to intravesical
nanoparticles in the human bladder.

In order to overcome potential limitations with passive targeting,
we next evaluated an approach commonly reported in the SERS literature
which uses the ratio of actively targeted nanoparticles to passively
targeted nanoparticles to classify tumor or normal tissue.24,28 The active-to-passive normalization technique exhibited a moderate
classification accuracy that was hampered by experimental noise in
the Raman signal (Figure 7). To overcome limitations imposed by noise, we designed an
alternative approach where the signal from actively targeted nanoparticles
was normalized to the sum of all three nanoparticles channels. This
signal processing approach resulted in lower noise sensitivity and
higher classification accuracy than the targeted-to-passive approach
and a similar classification accuracy to passive targeting (Figure 8).

the 2-sum ratios only depend on either the s440-CD47 or s420-CA9 signal,
the 2-sum ratios do not reflect correlations between s440-CD47 and
s420-CA9 binding and thus fall directly on each axis. (e) CD47:3-sum
and CA9:3-sum ratios for all N = 15 tissue samples.

Approach 1: Classifying Tissue Based on Raw, Non-Normalized
Signal Intensity
The first signal processing approach classified
tissue by applying linear discriminant analysis to the raw intensity
of each nanoparticle flavor. Figure 5a shows a white light image of a separate normal and
tumor tissue sample positioned adjacent to each other and an overlay
of each channel. As can be seen from Figure 5a, the raw intensity of each channel was
higher on the tumor tissue relative to the normal tissue. Figure 5b shows a three-dimensional
stem plot of the average signal intensity in each channel for all
15 tissue samples.

For the passively targeted s421-IgG4 nanoparticles,
the average binding level was 3.3-fold higher on tumor than normal
tissue (Figure 5c;
mean/median/min/max was 0.62/0.37/0.023/2.7 for normal, 2.2/2.0/0.6/4.1
for tumor, Mann–Whitney U test p < 0.01),
suggesting that passive binding of nanoparticles could be an accurate
classifier of bladder tissue. ROC analysis gave an AUC of 0.95 (0.76,
1.0) and 0.93 (0.73, 1.0) for classifying tissue using all three channels
or just s421-IgG4, respectively. The AUCs were not significantly different
for the three-channel vs one-channel processing approach
(p = 0.41). The leave-one-out cross-validation error
rate (LOO-CV-ER) for the three- and one-channel approach were both
33%. These data suggest that the raw signal intensity of the s421-IgG4
channel was just as good at classifying bladder tissue as the three-nanoparticle
mixture.

An interesting data point was the sample marked with
a black asterisk
at in Figure 5b, which
was deemed normal by the surgeon but bound s421-IgG4 nanoparticles
well above the level expected for normal tissue. During LOO-CV, the
passive Raman classifier (Approach 1) assigned a likelihood of 93%
that the tissue was tumor. Upon histological analysis of the tissue,
there was clear signs of hyperplasia (outlined in white) and CA9 staining
(red), suggesting that the sample may not have been actually normal
(Figure 5e). CA9 is
not expressed in normal bladder tissue,22,23 suggesting
that the sample may contain cancer. While this histological data was
not conclusive enough to reassign the entire tissue specimen to the
tumor class, the data did indicate that the putatively normal tissue
may have in fact contained cancer. This data point suggests that in
some cases, passively targeted Raman nanoparticles could identify
non-normal tissue in regions that appear normal on WLC.

Passive Targeting
Was Mediated by Enhanced Permeability of SERS
Nanoparticles in Cancer Relative to Normal Tissue
Our original
hypothesis was that binding levels of the untargeted, non-normalized
s421-IgG4 nanoparticles would be a poor classifier of cancer because
there would be no mechanism targeting them to diseased cancer tissue.
However, the data in Figure 5 show the unexpected result that s421-IgG4 binding levels
were 3.3-fold higher in cancer than in normal and that s421-IgG4 binding
levels classified tissue with an AUC ROC of 0.93 (0.73, 1.0). Higher
binding to bladder cancer was unexpected because experiments in intact
rat esophagus showed similar absolute binding levels in cancer and
normal.29 In excised breast tissue, binding
levels of SERS nanoparticles in tumor were 3-fold lower in tumor than
normal.30 In ex vivo human
bladders instilled with Qdot625-isotype control antibody conjugates,
no nanoparticle uptake was observed in cancerous tissue.20 The comparison to quantum dots, which are 15–20
nm in diameter, suggests that the larger size of the SERS particles
herein (120 nm) may contribute to their increased passive targeting.

Based on the data in Figure 5, we sought to better understand the mechanism behind passive
targeting to bladder cancer by testing the hypothesis that bladder
cancer exhibits higher permeability to SERS nanoparticles than normal
bladder (Figure 6).
This hypothesis was based on observations made in a previous study
that noted that the surface layer of epithelial cells is disrupted
in bladder cancer.20 It is well-known that
the epithelial surface in the bladder exhibits cellular tight junctions
and a GAG layer that protects the body by preventing the diffusion
molecules and nanoparticles from the bladder lumen back into the bloodstream.16,20,31 We hypothesized that this protective
layer partially blocks passive binding of SERS nanoparticles to normal
bladder tissue, but that the disruption of the protective layer by
cancer increases passive binding.

Tissue samples were stained
and washed with the same method used
for endoscope imaging, then frozen and sectioned orthogonally to the
tissue surface (Supporting Figure 5a).
H&E (top) and s421-IgG4 Raman images (bottom) of the resulting
sections are shown in Figure 6 for normal (a–c) and cancerous (d–f) bladder
tissues. As can be seen qualitatively from the Raman images, the nanoparticles
penetrate deeper in tumor than normal tissue, suggesting that the
cancer tissue was more permeable than normal to topically applied
nanoparticles. The line profiles used for calculating penetration
depth of nanoparticles are shown in Supporting Figure 5b,c (bottom). The resulting mean and standard deviation
of penetration depth were 11 ± 6 μm and 58 ± 14 μm
for normal and cancerous bladder tissues, respectively (Figure 6g, p <
10–4). The mean and standard deviation of the surface
coverage were 70 ± 17% and 99 ± 3% for normal and cancerous
bladder tissues, respectively (Figure 6h, p < 10–4).

In summary, s421-IgG4 exhibited higher penetration depth in bladder
cancer compared to normal bladder, which was indicative of higher
surface permeability in cancer. Furthermore, s421-IgG4 exhibited higher
binding levels (Figure 5c) in bladder cancer than normal bladder, suggesting enhanced retention
of IgG4-s421 in cancer. Had the retention of s421-IgG4 been equal
between cancer and normal, enhanced penetration of s421-IgG4 in bladder
cancer would have been negated by enhanced washout during the tissue
washing step, and the cancer and normal tissue would have exhibited
similar binding levels. Instead, the 3.3-fold higher binding levels
of nanoparticles in the cancer samples suggest that nanoparticles
in bladder cancer had higher retention during washing than did normal
bladder. Thus, the combined data suggest the existence of an enhanced
surface permeability and retention (ESPR) effect in bladder cancer,
which appears to be a topical version of the well-known enhanced permeability
and retention effect (EPR).32 The EPR effect,
which refers to the accumulation of intraveneous macromolecules in
tumors, is caused by fenestrations between defective vascular endothelial
cells and poor lymphatic drainage in tumors. The ESPR effect reported
herein refers to a similar but distinct concept where the normal bladder
urothelium is disrupted by cancer, thus allowing improved penetration
and retention of intravesical nanoparticles into the mucosa (Supporting Figure 6).

It is interesting
to note that the passive targeting mechanism
described above is related to physiological properties of the bladder
tissue and thus may not be specific to gold-silica nanoparticles.
Although further work is necessary, it is possible that similarly
sized intravesical viral vectors,33 fluorescent
nanoparticles such as quantum dots, and therapeutic nanoparticles34,35 could also exhibit passive targeting properties. Additionally, it
is currently unclear how tumor stage and common stressors such as
bacillus Calmette–Guerin immunotherapy, infection, and chemotherapy
affect passive binding of nanoparticles to bladder tissue.

While
the single-channel passive binding approach was effective
at classifying normal and cancer tissues in our data set, it has two
potential limitations. First, the single-channel approach does not
use any normalization, which could be problematic in a clinical procedure;
specifically, normalization controls for experimental variations in
laser intensity and working distance, experimental variations in the
staining and washing procedure, and tissue variations in passive targeting,
allowing isolation of the component of signal due to active binding
to the protein target. Second, molecular information inferred from
active binding levels may be useful for discriminating subtle but
important tissue differences like the difference between inflammation
and cancer. Because of these potential advantages, we continued to
explore additional processing techniques that employ normalization.

Approach 2: Active-to-Passive Normalization Exhibited Moderate
Classification Accuracy, and Accuracy Was Limited by Experimental
Noise
The active-to-passive normalization method, which is
commonly used in the SERS literature and in Figure 5, normalizes the signal of s420-CA9 or s440-CD47
to s421-IgG4. Figure 7a,b shows the active-to-passive ratios overlaid on the same sample
as in Figure 5a. Active-to-passive
ratio images for all samples are shown in Supporting Figures 7 and 8. In Figure 7a,b, the calculated ratios in the urothelium appear
noisy (discussed below), the s440-CD47 ratio appears higher in normal
than in tumor tissue, and the CA9 ratio appears approximately the
same between normal and tumor tissues.

Figure 7c compares the distribution of the CA9:IgG4
and CD47:IgG4 ratios in 15 ex vivo human tissue samples.
Qualitatively, there was an overlap between the tumor and normal distributions.
We quantitatively compared the ability of 2-plexed and 3-plexed active-to-passive
data to classify bladder tissue by calculating the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC, Figure 7d) and LOO-CV-ER for each case.
For the 2-plexed cases, the receiver operating characteristic area
under the curve (ROC AUC) was 0.57 (0.24, 0.86) and the LOO-CV-ER
was 60% for the CA9:IgG4 ratio, and the ROC AUC was 0.82 (0.52, 1.0)
and the LOO-CV error rate was 33% for the CD47:IgG4 ratio. When the
CD47:IgG4 and CA9:IgG4 were both used to classify tissue based on
their linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score (3-plexed case), the
ROC AUC was 0.82 (0.55, 1.0) and the LOO-CV-ER was 27%. For the active-to-passive
targeting approach, the CD47 and IgG4 2-plex AUC was not significantly
different from the 3-plex AUC (p = 0.5), indicating
that with active-to-passive targeting, addition of the CA9 channel
is did not improve tissue classification.

We hypothesized that
the cause of the wide ROC AUC confidence intervals
and LOO-CV error rates reported above are caused by high noise in
the active-to-passive ratios on the urothelium (see for example urothelium
of Figure 7a,b). To
test this, we simulated the experimental error of the calculated active-to-passive
binding ratios (Figure 7d). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the s421-IgG4 channel in Figure 7a was 1.7, and simulations
show that this results in a very low (≪1) SNR of the s440/s421
ratio. The low SNR of the ratio is probably due to noise bringing
the denominator of the ratio close to zero in some pixels and not
others, causing the pixel-to-pixel variance of the ratio to be very
large. Experimentally, the CD47:IgG4 ratio for the image in Figure 7b had a standard
error of the mean (SEM) of 41%. Notably, the median CD47:IgG4 ratios
for tumor and urothelium were 1.3 and 1.9, respectively, corresponding
to an effect size of 33%. Because the effect size and SEM are comparable,
it is not surprising that experimental noise degrades the classifier
performance when using the active-to-passive normalization approach.
In the future, this problem could be solved using brighter SERS particles36−38 or a more sensitive endoscope setup, but for the current study we
developed the active-to-sum normalization method, which had a simulated
SNR 24% higher than the s421-IgG4 channel (Figure 7d). The active-to-sum metric for the urothelium
in Figure 7a had a
SEM of 4.6%, which is 9-fold lower than the SEM of the active-to-passive
metric, indicating that active-to-sum normalization exhibits lower
noise sensitivity than active-to-passive normalization.

Approach 3:
Active-to-Sum Normalization Exhibited Lower Noise
and Higher Classification Accuracy Compared to Targeted-to-Passive
Normalization
For the active-to-sum normalization method,
each channel is normalized to the sum of all three channels. Overlays
of active-to-sum normalized data are shown in Figure 8a–c and Supporting Figures 7 and 8. Qualitatively, the CA9-to-sum ratio appeared
higher in the tumor than normal, and the CD47-to-sum ratio looked
lower in the tumor than normal. Figure 8b,c is analogous to Figure 7b and shows how the clustering of data changes
as additional molecular information is added. As can be seen in the
two-channel active-to-sum normalization cases (Figure 8d), there was overlap between the tumor and
urothelium distributions. A possible cause of this overlap is that
the CA9:2-sum and CD47:2-sum ratios only contain information from
one molecular target and as a result are less able to differentiate
between the normal and cancer tissue. For the CA9:2-sum ratio, the
mean and standard deviation for tumor and normal tissues were 0.6
± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.1, respectively (t test p = 0.70). For the CD47:2-sum ratio the mean and standard
deviation for tumor and normal tissues were 0.5 ± 0.1 and 0.7
± 0.1, respectively (t test p = 0.04). The ROC AUC and LOO-CV-ER were 0.57 (0.24, 0.87) and 73%
for the CA9:2-sum ratio, while for the CD47:2-sum ratio, they were
0.82 (0.55, 1.0) and 33%. These data suggest that the CD47:2-sum ratio
is the best classifier if only two channels are used.

The active-to-sum
normalization technique which uses all three channels has two degrees
of freedom, which are shown for normal and tumor samples in Figure 8e. The resulting
ROC AUC was 0.93 (0.75, 1.0) and the LOO-CV-ER was 20%. The ROC AUC
for the three channel case was statistically significantly greater
than the s420-CA9:2-sum ROC (p = 0.01) but not the
s440-CD47 AUC (p = 0.14). Thus, the tighter confidence
intervals, higher AUC, and lower LOO-CV-ER suggest a trend toward
higher classification accuracy with three channels compared to two
channels, although the trend was not statistically significant compared
to the CD47:2-sum ratio. We believe that this trend justifies further
development of multiplexed molecular imaging strategies because multiplexed
detection of two targets could outperform detection of a single target.

Summary: Both Passively and Actively Targeted Nanoparticles
Accurately Classified Bladder Cancer with an AUC ROC > 0.9
Of all of the tissue approaches investigated herein, the two that
most warrant further study are the non-normalized s421-IgG4 nanoparticles
and 3-plexed active-to-sum normalized nanoparticles. These two approaches
both resulted in a ROC AUC of 0.93, and the AUCs were not statistically
different (p = 0.50). For clinical translation, the
decision to use passive or active targeting is influenced by a trade-off
between nanoparticle formulation simplicity and measurement robustness.
In particular, the passive targeting approach requires a simple formulation
with only one nanoparticle flavor that may not require an antibody
or biomarker. Furthermore, with the passive targeting, the signal
processing is simpler because cancer is identified by positive contrast.
We anticipate that the simpler formulation behind passive targeting
will facilitate regulatory approval and adoption by physicians. However,
the actively targeted approach also has some clear advantages. First,
active targeting uses normalization during post-processing, which
helps control the experimental variations listed above. Second, as
more bladder cancer surface biomarkers continue to be discovered,
additional Raman channels can be included which could improve classification
accuracy. Furthermore, it is possible that the molecular approach
can discriminate tissue injury like inflammation from cancer, which
would reduce the time physicians spend resecting inflamed but otherwise
healthy tissue.

Limitations
While the data herein
suggest that intravesical
nanoparticles could be a promising approach for improving tissue resection
of NMIBC, there are a few limitations of this study worth mentioning.
First, all data in this study were carried out in ex vivo tissue specimens and not whole bladders. Because both the biological
(e.g., nanoparticle endocytosis)
and physical (e.g., motion of nanoparticle
solution) behaviors of the system are different ex vivo, we currently do not know how the classification performance and
staining procedure shown herein will generalize to direct instillation
in whole bladders. Second, the active targeting approach is limited
by the availability of cell surface bladder biomarkers. As more biomarkers
continue to be discovered and validated, we believe that the diagnostic
accuracy of the active targeting approach will increase further. Finally,
it is unclear if Raman cystoscopy or fluorescence cystoscopy will
provide the most clinical utility. Fluorescence cystoscopy has the
advantages of high imaging speed and commercially available hardware,
while Raman is preferable for multiplexing multiple nanoparticle flavors.13

Conclusions
This article evaluates
the tissue classification performance of
a Raman nanoparticle-endoscope system designed to supplement WLC.
We found that 1-plexed imaging of passively targeted nanoparticles
and 3-plexed imaging of CD47, CA9, and passively targeted nanoparticles
classified human tissue with a ROC AUC of 0.93 (0.73, 1.0) and 0.93
(0.75, 1.0), respectively. Tissue penetration depth was on average
5-fold higher in tumors than normal, which suggests an ESPR effect
in bladder cancer. Although the trend was not statistically significant,
the 3-plexed active-to-sum approach classified tissue more accurately
than the 2-plexed active-to-sum approaches, indicating that multiplexed
detection of multiple molecular targets with Raman endoscopy could
improve identification of residual disease during WLC. Furthermore,
the nanoparticle-endoscope system identified one sample that appeared
normal on WLC as tumor, and upon subsequent histological analysis,
that sample exhibited hyperplasia and positive CA9 staining. These
data suggest that Raman endoscopy may outperform the gold standard
in some cases. Collectively, the data herein support Raman endoscopy
and intravesical SERS nanoparticles as a promising approach for improving
resection of NMIBC.

Methods
Antibodies
For SERS nanoparticle functionalization,
Hu5F9-G439 was obtained courtesy of the
Irving Weissman Lab and used for targeting to CD47. For targeting
to CA9, mouse monoclonal antibody (GT12) was obtained additive-free
from GeneTex. hIgG4 isotype control antibody was obtained from antibodiesonline.com. For tissue
immunofluorescence clone B6H12.2 (Novus Biologicals) was used for
CD47 detection and NB100-417 (Novus Biologicals) was used for CA9
detection. For negative controls the CA9 deactivating peptide (NB100-417PEP,
Novus Biologicals) and a mouse IgG1 isotype (product no. MAB002, R&D
Biosystems) for CD47 were used.

Functionalization of Raman
Particles
SERS particles
were obtained from Cabot Security Materials (formally Oxonica Materials).
SERS particles were functionalized with antibodies using a procedure
similar to the one outlined in ref (24). First, surface disulfides on SERS particles
were reduced by suspending the SERS nanoparticles in freshly prepared
solution of 10 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS, Sigma-Aldrich)
at pH 7.3 for 30 min. After washing the reduced nanoparticles three
times in 10 mM MOPS, nanoparticles were mixed with Dylight 650 (DL650)-maleimide
(Thermo Fisher) at a molar ratio of 60,000 dye molecules per nanoparticle
in pH 7.3 MOPS buffer and allowed to incubate for 3 h, resulting in
3000 dye molecules per nanoparticle. Dye-labeled nanoparticles were
then washed five times in 10 mM MOPS buffer to remove unbound dye.
Next, dye-labeled nanoparticles were suspended at 400 pM, followed
by addition of antibody and SM-(PEG)12 cross-linker (NHS-PEG12-maleimide, Thermo Fisher part 22112). The reaction contained
3000 cross-linkers per nanoparticle and 200 antibodies per nanoparticle,
and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 3
h. Next, remaining sulfhydryl groups on the nanoparticle surface were
PEGylated by incubating the nanoparticle solution with 600,000 molar
excess of MM-(PEG)12 (methyl-PEG12-maleimide,
Thermo Fisher part 22711) at room temperature for 3 h. Finally, the
functionalized nanoparticles were washed three times in nanoparticle
storage solution (sterile 1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mM MOPS buffer
at pH 7.3) and stored at 3 nM in nanoparticle storage solution with
0.03% sodium azide. Herein, functionalized nanoparticles will be referred
to by their flavor and target. For example, s440 nanoparticles targeted
to CD47 are called s440-CD47.

Flow Cytometry of Functionalized
Nanoparticles Bound to DLD-1
and HCT-116 Cells
Binding specificity of antibody-targeted
gold-silica nanoparticles to their target cell surface protein was
evaluated using flow cytometry as described previously.24 Samples were performed by preparing aliquots
of 200,000 cells at 2 million cells/mL (100 μL volume) and adding
5 μL of 3 nM Oxonica-DL650-antibody-(PEG)12 to achieve
a final nanoparticle concentration of 150 pM. Nanoparticle/cell mixtures
were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, washed once in 2 mL PBS +
1% BSA, and resuspended in 200 μL PBS + 1% BSA for analysis.
For epitope blocking experiments, prior to adding nanoparticles, DLD-1
cells were suspended in anti-CD47 ranging from 1 ng/mL to 100 μg/mL
anti-CD47 for 30 min on ice. For experiments testing binding to CD47,
wild-type and CD47 knockout DLD1 cells were provided courtesy of D.
Kurtz and I. Weissman. For experiments testing binding to CA9, CA9
expression was induced in HCT-116 cells with transient transfection
as described below. CA9 epitope blocking was performed on HCT-116
cells transfected with the CA9 plasmid with 35 ug/mL anti-CA9 for
1 h on ice. Cell sorting/flow cytometry analysis for this project
was done on instruments in the Stanford Shared FACS Facility.

Transfection
of CA9 into HCT116 Cells
A plasmid encoding
the eGFP gene fused to the intracellular C-terminus of hCA9 (NM_001216.2)
was obtained from VectorBuilder (Cyagen Biosciences Inc., Santa Clara,
CA). The human protein portion of the plasmid was sequenced by Sequetech
(Mountain View, CA) and had a >99% match to hCA9 according to BLAST
(blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Transient transfections of hCA9 into HCT116 cells were generated in
6 well plates using the standard Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher)
protocol. Transfected cells were allowed to grow for 4 days before
they were used for FACS experiments.

Spectral Unmixing and Background
Subtraction of Raw Raman Spectra
All signal processing codes
can be found at https://github.com/ryanmdavis/MolecularEndoscopy and has been described previously.14 Spectral
unmixing and tissue background signal removal of the three nanoparticle
flavors (s440, s421, s481) were performed by representing the problem
as a linear system of equations given by 1  where b is a N × 1 matrix that contains
one raw Raman spectrum obtained by
the endoscope at a single location on tissue, A is
a N × M matrix composed of M different N × 1 reference spectra
(described below) that specify the forward problem, and x is a M × 1 matrix that quantifies the contribution
of each reference spectrum to the raw signal b. The M reference spectra were categorized as either SERS signal,
tissue background signal, or a linear background signal. Reference
SERS signals were the background-subtracted SERS signal of s440, s421,
and s481. Tissue background signal spectra were the first six principal
components of 100 spectra obtained from fresh mouse DLD1 xenograft
tumors (no nanoparticles). For Raman microscopy, two additional background
spectra were added into the model: the spectra of glass and optimal
cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Fisher Scientific part 23-730-571).

Once A was constructed from the M reference spectra, the inverse problem was solved by taking the
Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of A (A+) in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). This
allows one to obtain the least-squares fit of the M reference spectra to the raw spectrum b using a
matrix multiplication: 2  where the M elements of x̂ are the contribution of each reference spectrum
to b.14 For endoscope
spectra, unmixing was performed using data in the range 1100–1700
cm–1. For microscope spectra, unmixing was performed
using data in the range 900–1700 cm–1.

Each experiment also had a concentration reference that controlled
deviations from a 1:1:1 concentration ratio in the nanoparticle solution
used to stain the tissue. This concentration reference was achieved
by applying 5 μL of the nanoparticle mixture used to stain tissue
onto a 10 mm2 section of filter paper. The stained filter
paper was then placed next to the stained tissue sample, and both
were scanned in the same experiment. During image reconstruction,
on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the Raman intensity in each channel was
divided by the average intensity of the same channel in the concentration
reference filter paper. This procedure controlled deviations from
the nominal 1:1:1 concentration ratio in the nanoparticle mixture.

Raman Endoscope and Imaging
All imaging was performed
with a Raman endoscope that was built in-house.14,15,40 The laser wavelength was 785 nm. Ex vivo tissue samples were stained with a 1:1:1 mixture
of s420-CA9:s421-IgG4:s440-CD47 nanoparticles, with each nanoparticle
flavor at 300 pm. Staining was performed at room temperature and placed
on a quartz microscope slide which in turn was placed on a movable
stage. A forward-facing endoscope probe was positioned perpendicular
to the surface of tissue at a distance of <1 cm. The laser power
was measured with a laser power meter and adjusted to 40 mW at the
beginning of each experiment. The sample was raster scanned under
the endoscope probe with a step size of 1 mm and a signal integration
time of 1 s per image pixel. Raw spectra were unmixed and displayed
as an image using Matlab as described in the Spectral
Unmixing and Background Subtraction of Raw Raman Spectra section.

The ability of the nanoparticle-endoscope system to discriminate
normal and cancerous bladder was assessed using region of interest
(ROI) analysis of Raman images. Maps of nanoparticle levels (x̂ from eq 2) were manually registered to photographs of the tissue samples.
Regions of interest were manually drawn on the images. Care was taken
to exclude the margin surrounding the edges of the samples, as the
edges had exposed submucosa that exhibited strong passive binding
of the nanoparticles. The mean signal in each ROI was assigned to
the conditions “normal” or “cancer” based
on the surgeon’s diagnosis and pathology report. The standard
error of the mean signal ratio  of two channels c1 and c2 of different
tissue class
(i.e., tumor or normal) was calculated
using the standard error propagation formula:  where , , c̅1,
and c̅2 are the standard error of
the means and the means of the signal in channel c1 and c2. When c1 and c2 came from the same
tissue class, the standard error of the mean was calculated directly
from the distribution of ratios across different tissue samples.

Tissue Procurement and Staining
Nineteen patients who
were treated with TURBT or radical cystectomy at the Stanford University
hospital or Palo Alto VA consented to their tissue being used in this
study. All patient’s tissue samples were stained with the 3-nanoparticle
mixture and imaged on the microscope (6 samples) or endoscope (15
samples). Tissue was harvested under the approval of the institutional
review boards (IRBs). Cystectomy-derived samples were harvested after
bladder removal and placed on ice within 15 min of bladder removal.
TURBT-derived samples were placed on ice within 15 min of resection.

Samples were then stained with SERS nanoparticles at room temperature
by dabbing the luminal surface of the tissue in 20 μL of nanoparticle
mixture every 20 s for 5 min. Stained samples were then washed by
submerging the sample for 15 s in 50 mL PBS. Excess PBS was removed
from the tissue sample by placing the edge of the sample (not the
luminal surface) in contact with a task wipe (Kimwipe, Kimtech Sciences).
Stained and washed samples were then imaged with a Raman microscope
or frozen in OCT compound for histological analysis. Table S1 contains the clinical pathology results and a summary
of the allocation of tissue samples to different experiments.

Tissue
Classification Approaches
Three signal processing
approaches were evaluated for classification accuracy (Table 1). In Table 1, the values s420-CA9, s421-IgG4, and s440-CD47
refer to the signal intensity of each channel in a given pixel. For
all approaches, Matlab’s LDA routine fitcdiscr was used to
determine the posterior probability of a tissue sample being tumor.
ROC curves were generated by feeding the posterior tumor probability
of each sample into Matlab’s perfcurve routine. ROC AUC error
bars were calculated with Matlab’s perfcurve using the percentile
method. ROC curves were compared using Delong’s method for
paired ROCs in the pROC package41 in R
(R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).

Tissue Immunofluorescence
and Raman Microscopy
All
tissues were embedded in OCT compound, frozen while fresh, and sectioned
into 10 μm sections. For CA9 staining, samples were fixed in
PFA, stained with 0.2 μg/mL rabbit polyclonal anti-CA9 (Novus
Biologicals NB100–147), and detected with anti-rabbit F(ab′)2-Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (Cell signaling Technology, 4414S).
As a negative control, these stained images were compared to images
obtained by pre-incubating the CA9 antibody with the immunizing peptide
(Novus Biologicals NB100-417PEP). For CD47 staining, samples were
fixed in acetone, stained with 0.2 μg/mL mouse monoclonal B6H12.2
(Novus Biologicals NBP2-31106), and detected with anti-mouse F(ab′)2-Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (Cell signaling Technology 4410S).
As a negative control, tissue was treated with 0.2 μg/mL mouse
IgG1 (Novus Biologicals, MAB002) instead of B6H12.2. All tissue immunofluorescence
images were acquired on a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics,
Hamamatsu City, Japan).

For Raman microscopy, 50 μm sections
that were adjacent to immunofluorescence sections were adhered to
a quartz slide. Then Permount Mounting Medium (Fischer Scientific,
SP15–100) was placed on top of the sample, and a glass coverslip
was quickly pressed on top of the sample and allowed to harden. Raman
signal was measured on a InVia microscope (Renishaw, Wotton-under-Edge,
England) with a 50× objective on standard mapping mode (5 μm
step size in both directions). Images were reconstructed in Matlab
using the same procedure described in the Spectral
Unmixing and Background Subtraction of Raw Raman Spectra section.

Quantification of Penetration Depth and Surface Coverage
The position of the bladder tissue surface was estimated by manually
drawing a line on the s421-IgG4 Raman image of the tissue (red lines
in Supporting Figure 5b,c, bottom). The
surface was then smoothed with a median filter with a window width
of 10 pixels. Next, for each pixel in the surface line (red) image,
profiles were generated normal to the estimated tissue surface (white
lines in Supporting Figure 5b,c, bottom).
For clarity, Supporting Figure 5b,c only
shows every tenth image profile (white lines). The penetration depth
was calculated separately for each profile normal to the tissue surface
as the number of pixels with s421-IgG4 signal five standard deviations
above the mean background signal. The surface coverage percent was
calculated as the percent of profiles with at least one pixel five
standard deviations above the mean background signal. Three normal
and three tumor samples were subjected to this analysis, and for each
sample, three separate 100 μm sections of surface were analyzed
resulting in 9 total data points for each tissue type.
