Prodrug strategies
that facilitate localized and controlled activity
of small-molecule therapeutics can reduce systemic exposure and improve
pharmacokinetics, yet limitations in activation chemistry have made
it difficult to assign tunable multifunctionality to prodrugs. Here,
we present the design and application of a modular small-molecule
caging strategy that couples bioorthogonal cleavage with a self-immolative
linker and an aliphatic anchor. This strategy leverages recently discovered in vivo catalysis by a nanoencapsulated palladium compound
(Pd-NP), which mediates alloxylcarbamate cleavage and triggers release
of the activated drug. The aliphatic anchor enables >90% nanoencapsulation
efficiency of the prodrug, while also allowing >104-fold
increased cytotoxicity upon prodrug activation. We apply the strategy
to a prodrug formulation of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), demonstrating
its ability to target microtubules and kill cancer cells only after
selective activation by Pd-NP. Computational pharmacokinetic modeling
provides a mechanistic basis for the observation that the nanotherapeutic
prodrug strategy can lead to more selective activation in the tumor,
yet in a manner that is more sensitive to variable enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effects. Combination treatment with the nanoencapsulated
MMAE prodrug and Pd-NP safely blocks tumor growth, especially when
combined with a local radiation therapy regimen that is known to improve
EPR effects, and represents a conceptual step forward in prodrug design.

Bioorthogonal
chemical reactions
are increasingly developed as tools for the controlled delivery and
activation of therapeutics, molecular imaging or detection agents,
and as synthetic biology reagents.1 “Ligation”
reactions, for example, based on stepwise administration of a pretargeting
agent and a complementary imaging2 or drug3 ligand, have demonstrated the potential of using
bioorthogonal approaches such as inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder
reaction (IEDDA) to enhance selective targeting in models of cancer.
Alternatively, bioorthogonal bond cleavage reactions1 may employ a variety of strategies, including (i) photoinduced
decaging using nitroaromatics,4 (ii) deallylation
using palladium5 and ruthenium catalysts,6 (iii) depropargylation using palladium7 or gold8 particles,
(iv) IEDDA-induced “click-to-release”,9 and (v) cleavage induced by strain-promoted alkene–azide
cycloaddition.10 These strategies have
matured to the point of becoming promising tools for activating caged
prodrugs.

Prodrugs are a proven route to limiting exposure in
off-target
tissues, especially for cytotoxic anticancer compounds such as microtubule-targeting
agents. Drug caging, typically by protecting a primary amine critical
for drug activity, can be used to restrict drug action until the prodrug
is activated by a spatiotemporally controlled deprotection reaction.
Nanoparticle formulation can achieve the same goals, and it is appealing,
in principle, to combine the two approaches for controlling exposure
in target vs off-target tissues. Sufficient drug
activation at the target disease site is often a limiting factor for
both prodrug and nanoparticle (NP) strategies. Reactants are required
to maintain chemical stability until they reach the target, at which
point they must sufficiently react to achieve therapeutically active
drug concentrations. Compared to click-chemistry approaches, bioorthogonal
catalysts have been attractive for their diverse reactivity and efficient
activation of caged compounds. Unfortunately, most strategies with
transition-metal catalysts have relied on microparticles,8 elemental powders, resins,11 and for traditional synthetic chemistry applications, simple
salts or phenylphosphines, all of which have issues with biocompatibility,
stability, toxicity, and systemic bioavailability. As a result, in vivo demonstration of bioorthogonal catalysis has been
limited, especially as applied to nanoformulated drugs.

Recently,
a nanoencapsulated palladium catalyst (Pd-NP) was reported
to overcome these issues using bis[tri(2-furyl)phosphine] palladium(II)
dichloride, PdCl2(TFP)2, in a biocompatible
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-polyethylene
glycol platform.5 The 60 nm Pd-NP formulation
demonstrated stability in biological solutions and exploited the “enhanced
permeability and retention” (EPR) effect to passively accumulate
in solid tumors following systemic administration. The EPR effect
is further exploited by co-administering a separate nanoformulation
of prodrug, which cooperatively reduces off-target drug activation
and toxicity.5 Pd-NP has been both safe
and effective at locally activating prodrugs in xenograft tumors,
and its first demonstration relied on model allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)
and propargyloxycarbonyl (Poc) derivatives of the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic,
doxorubicin (DOX). Although effective, this amphiphilic prodrug was
nanoencapsulated with relatively poor efficiency (22%), and its relatively
low potency in cell killing required high doses.5 Furthermore, other drugs may be completely incompatible
for nanoencapsulation or activity caging with this approach. Therefore,
a need exists to expand the repertoire of bioorthogonal cleavage functionality,
thereby facilitating improved prodrug engineering—in this case,
to improve nanoencapsulation efficiency and cytotoxic turn-on.

This work presents the design of a bioorthogonal cleavage strategy
based on coupling palladium-catalyzed deallylation with a self-immolative
linker, which has been functionalized with an aliphatic anchor for
efficient nanoencapsulation and blockage of prodrug action. This strategy
provides a modular platform for adding functionality to prodrugs. In
this application, prodrug nanoencapsulation efficiency is increased
to >90% and >104 fold-increase in cytotoxicity is
realized
upon prodrug activation. As a proof-of-principle, we design a prodrug
of the microtubule targeting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).
MMAE is typical of a drug that is too toxic for systemic delivery,
but that has met with success using tumor-selective targeting mostly
in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). However, ADCs are very limited
in the on-target exposure that they can achieve. We therefore formulated
caged MMAE as a NP using alkyl chain immobilization, thus combining
two principles for improving tumor vs whole body
exposure. Upon activation by Pd-NP, caged MMAE (C16proMMAE)
disrupts microtubule activity in live cells and becomes cytotoxic
at <100pM. C16proMMAE safely blocks tumor growth in
mouse models of cancer when combined with Pd-NP. Computational modeling
suggests that the dual NP strategy can limit systemic exposure of
toxic activated drugs relative to what is achieved in the tumor, but
especially relies on the EPR effect. To exploit this reliance, we
used single low-dose radiation to enhance EPR, which led to synergistic
tumor shrinkage when combined with the prodrug strategy. Overall,
these results advance bioorthogonal catalysis toward clinical applicability
and expand the possibilities for prodrug design.

Results/Discussion
Nanoparticulate
Prodrug Design, Optimization, and Characterization
The overall
design for prodrug multifunctionality lies in a central
three-branched self-immolative linker (SIL) based on 4-aminomandelic
acid (Figure 1). The
NH2-trigger is protected by the palladium-reactive Alloc
group, while the benzylic position and the carboxyl group accommodate
both the drug and an additional functional moiety, respectively, which
in this case was used to tune hydrophobicity based on the particular
application. Upon palladium-mediated cleavage of Alloc, self-immolation
of the linker leads to drug release via rapid 1,6-elimination
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 Overview of
modular prodrug design strategy. A self-immolative
linker (gray) bridges three modular functional aspects of an inactive
nontoxic prodrug: a bioorthogonally cleavable protective group (shown
here in red as allyloxycarbonyl, alloc) that is removed upon exposure
to a triggering agent, a nanoencapsulation anchor (shown here in green
using an aliphatic C16 chain), and the caged drug payload
(blue). A bioorthogonal activating agent, here using Pd-NP based on
the polymeric micellar encapsulation of PdCl2(TFP)2, leads to drug uncaging and activation in a spatiotemporally
controlled manner.

As a first test, we designed
a fluorogenic probe to screen reactivity
against a panel of palladium compounds with organic ligands that were
discovered from previous studies to be active in physiological solutions.5 The central SIL and Alloc groups were used to
cage 4-methyl-7-aminocoumarin (AMC), with addition of a polyethylene
glycol (PEG) side chain to improve solubility, yielding Alloc-SIL-PEG4-AMC (Figure S1a). Bioorthogonal
activation, monitored by fluorescence turn-on (Figure S1b), was screened in Hank’s buffered saline
solution (HBSS) and minimal essential medium (MEM), two physiologically
relevant aqueous solutions that are ubiquitous in mammalian cell culture
modeling. Consistent with previous studies of Alloc- and Poc-deprotection,5 PdCl2(TFP)2 was most efficient,
achieving >75% yield in HBSS (Figure S1c).

Using PdCl2(TFP)2, we measured cleavage
kinetics
of the Alloc-SIL caging strategy and compared them to bis-alloc-rhodamine-110
(Alloc2R110) deprotection, as a previously used model prodrug
substrate.5 Encouragingly, Pd-NP uncaged
Alloc-SIL-PEG4-AMC approximately 1.5-fold faster than Alloc2R110 (based on calculated second-order rate constants, Figure S1d). Thus, the Alloc-SIL strategy enables
multifunctionality without compromising reaction kinetics.

We
next applied the prodrug strategy to two model anticancer therapies,
MMAE and DOX. The Alloc-SIL group was employed as above, but using
a C16 aliphatic anchor rather than PEG in order to facilitate
efficient nanoencapsulation into a clinically relevant polymeric micellar
formulation containing a hydrophobic PLGA-based core. The resulting
lipophilic prodrugs Alloc-SIL-C16-MMAE (“C16proMMAE”, Figure 2a) and Alloc-SIL-C16-DOX (“C16proDOX”, Figure 2b) were both nanoencapsulated with >90% efficiency with acceptable
size and polydispersity, shown by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, Figure 2c–d)
and dynamic light scattering (Figure S2a). Without the C16 anchor, the amphiphilic DOX (cLogP
= −0.7) exhibited only moderate encapsulation (22%),5 and encapsulation of parent MMAE was undetectable
using the same nanoprecipitation strategy. The C16 anchored
prodrug nanoformulations were stable, with no increase in size or
polydispersity after 72 h at 37 °C in PBS; size was uniform with
PDI of 0.11–0.13 throughout (Figure S2b). Over 72 h at 37 °C in PBS, release of the prodrug payload
from the nanoformulation was 20% ± 6% and 9% ± 1% for C16proDOX and C16proMMAE, respectively (n = 3).

determined for caged MMAE (e) and DOX (f) at the indicated concentration
(x-axis), in the presence of varying amounts of Pd-NP
bioorthogonal trigger, over 72 h treatment using HT1080 fibrosarcoma
cells (n = 2, data are means ± s.e.m.). Parent
noncaged compounds were also tested as controls (black curves).

Bioorthogonally Triggered in Vitro Cytotoxicity
of the Prodrug
In addition to enhancing nanoencapsulation
efficiency, the SIL strategy further reduced cytotoxicity of DOX in
its caged form, tested using HT1080 fibrosarcoma cancer cells (a model
extensively characterized for its in vitro and in vivo responsiveness to prodrug nanoformulations). Alloc
caging increased the concentration at which 50% of cells died in a
resazurin-based cytotoxicity assay (IC50) from 0.1 μM
to 18 μM; however, the IC50 was not reached at concentrations
up to 50 μM for the C16proDOX compound. The concentration
at which 20% of cells died (IC20) was roughly 15-fold higher
than for the previously described prodrug Alloc-DOX5 and 1900-fold higher than for uncaged DOX (Figure S3). For both prodrug formulations, co-incubation
of cells with Pd-NP restored drug cytotoxicity (Figure S3c).

Compared to the DOX prodrugs, C16proMMAE exhibited even greater potency upon Pd-NP activation, showing
a >104-fold increase in IC50 to 15 pM, which
is comparable to cytotoxicity of the uncaged parent compound, MMAE
(Figure 2e–f).
C16proMMAE shows >10-fold enhanced cytotoxicity when
incubated
with sub-micromolar Pd-NP, which is promising considering 5–7.5
μM tumoral Pd-NP concentrations have been safely achieved in
xenograft tumor models.5 Based on cytotoxicity,
the level of C16proMMAE activation approaches >90% as
Pd-NP
concentration is increased to 50 μM. Although this concentration
is high for typical small-molecule therapeutics, past studies have
shown it to be relatively nontoxic (typical IC50 > 100
μM),5 and it is modest when considering
that many transition-metal bioorthogonal catalysts, including those
based on Pd, are used as heterogeneous resins and implants that often
employ much larger doses of metal by mass.12

Mechanisms of Cellular NP Uptake and Activity
We next
investigated the mechanism of cellular prodrug uptake. HT1080 cells
were made to transgenically express Rab7a-RFP and Lamp1-RFP fluorescent
fusion proteins, which localize to the late endosome and lysosome,
respectively. After 24 h treatment with fluorescent NPs based on the
C16 prodrug formulation, co-localization was quantified
between the NPs and Rab7a or Lamp1 positive vesicles (Figures 3a and S4a). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that NPs accumulated
at high levels in vesicle-sized puncta within cells (Figure S4a). Approximately 1/3 of these NP puncta were located
in Rab7a-RFP+ vesicles, while roughly 2/3 were associated with Lamp1-RFP+
vesicles, suggesting NP uptake through endosomal/lysosomal pathways.
Co-treatment with inhibitors of macropinocytosis (5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, EIPA) and actin-dependent
processes including macropinocytosis/endocytosis (latrunculin A and
cytochalasin D as inhibitors of actin polymerization) acutely reduced
the uptake of NPs (Figure 3b). Broad inhibition of kinase signaling (via staurosporine), which is thought to be especially important for
macropinocytic uptake in RAS mutant cancer cells such as HT1080,13 also decreased NP accumulation. These results
collectively suggest that uptake of PLGA-PEG NPs, similar in structure
to Pd-NP and C16 prodrug NPs, occurs through actin-dependent
endocytic/macropinocytic processes that lead to predominant lysosomal
accumulation.

Figure 3 Imaging reveals in vitro pathways of
cell uptake
and C16proDOX activation. (a) HT1080 tumor cells expressing
either Rab7a-RFP or Lamp1-RFP fusion proteins were incubated with
a fluorescently labeled NP based on the prodrug formulation (PLGA-PEG
+ PLGA-BODIPY630) and imaged 24 h later. Co-localization was determined
by tabulating the fraction of NP-positive puncta (vesicles) in cells
that contained high RFP expression or not (labeled red and gray, respectively; n > 10 cells, bars are mean ± std. dev.). (b) Following
30 min pretreatment with the indicated compounds, HT1080 cells were
treated with the same NP as in (a) and imaged 3 h later (n > 6 biological replicates; mean ± s.e.m.). (c–d)
HT1080
tumor cells were treated with C16proDOX, DOX, or Pd-NP
with C16proDOX for 24 h and then imaged by fluorescence
microscopy (representative images shown in (c)) to evaluate subcellular
drug accumulation based on endogenous anthracycline fluorescence (scale
bar, 20 μm). Yellow lines (c) denote representative examples
of how fluorescence intensity profiles were quantified from line-scans
through cells (d), shown as means (thick line) ± s.e.m. (shading; n > 10), for hoechst (green) and anthracycline fluorescence
(red).

Past reports have delved into
mechanisms of intracellular hydrolytic
and enzymatic PLGA degradation for controlled drug release.13 While environmentally sensitive polymers have
been successfully used in the past to facilitate endosomal escape,
here these strategies did not appear necessary for prodrug activation
and cytotoxic action. Despite endosomal/lysosomal NP accumulation,
Pd-NP co-treatment was still able to restore a large fraction of the
prodrug’s cytotoxicity, such that its potency approaches that
achieved with the parent drug (especially for C16proMMAE, Figure 2e). Prodrug activation
can occur both extracellularly and intracellularly depending on relative
pharmacokinetics and rates of prodrug release from the NP vehicle.
In the models used here, we infer that the majority of C16prodrug activation occurs intracellularly, given its slow extracellular
release rate from the NP vehicle compared with time scales of pharmacokinetic
clearance; <10% of C16proDOX is activated when Pd-NP
and prodrug-NPs are co-incubated in 37 °C PBS (measured by HPLC
as in Figure S5), and by 72 h, the majority
of NPs have been systemically cleared and taken up by cells, at least
in the xenograft models used. Previous studies indicate Pd-mediated
prodrug activation can occur extracellularly, including in the interstitium
of tumor xenografts.5 However, the prodrug
in those cases did not contain a C16 anchor, therefore
leading to roughly 90% in vitro prodrug release from
the NP vehicle into solution by 72 h at 37 °C in PBS. In contrast,
<10% of C16proMMAE is released in vitro into solution after 72 h (Figure S2),
which corresponds to a 20-fold slower kinetic release rate. Furthermore,
past work with C16-anchored fluorescent prodrugs encapsulated
in similar PLGA-PEG NPs has shown direct cellular NP uptake to be
a dominant component of delivery, including in tumor xenografts and
in the HT1080 model.14

Several recent
studies have implicated lysosomal pH as a contributing
factor in payload release, using chloroquine (CQ) as an inhibitor
of endosomal acidification and of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.15,16 We co-treated HT1080 cells with CQ, Pd-NP, and C16proDOX
to understand whether CQ could block catalytic prodrug activation.
In agreement with previous studies, we found that CQ treatment led
to the enhanced accumulation of NPs in distinctly large vesicles consistent
with the induction of LC3+ autophagosome enrichment (Figure S4b).15,16 Despite this morphological change,
only modest impact was observed in the cytotoxicity of combined Pd-NP
and C16proDOX treatment, suggesting at least in this in vitro model that CQ effects, including its impact on
lysosomal pH, are not substantial enough to completely block Pd-mediated
prodrug activation (Figure S4c). Moreover,
our past work has indicated that low pH is not required for release
and activity of Pd from its NP vehicle.5 While further investigation of the subcellular mechanisms by which
Pd-NP activates prodrugs extends beyond the scope of this manuscript,
data at hand suggest a model of endosomal/lysosomal accumulation and
gradual liberation of the prodrug and catalyst from the NP vehicles,
allowing them to react with each other. Controlled prodrug bioorthogonal
cleavage then leads to the formation of an active compound that is
able to escape sequestration and act on its intracellular target.
Past work using fluorescent C16-anchored prodrugs within
PLGA-PEG nanoformulations has highlighted how drug payloads can freely
escape lysosomal sequestration and even act on neighboring cells (including
in HT1080 tumors), even though their polymeric vehicle remains intracellularly
confined.14

Imaging the Molecular Action
of Pd-Activated Prodrugs
The intrinsic fluorescence of DOX
enabled us to track where the prodrug
actually accumulated in cells with and without activation by Pd-NP.
Uncaged parent DOX is capable of covalently binding DNA via the 3′-NH2 group of the daunosamine sugar moiety,
thus leading to topoisomerase II disruption and DNA damage. Consequently,
covalently reacting and DNA-intercalating DOX primarily accumulates
in the nuclei of cancer cells. However, fluorescence microscopy in
HT1080 cancer cells showed that lipophilic C16proDOX accumulated
primarily in cytoplasmic/perinuclear cellular compartments consistent
with late endosomal and lysosomal uptake but not in the nucleus itself
(Figure S5a). Encouragingly, co-incubation
of cells with Pd-NP led to co-localization of the catalyst with its
prodrug substrate in the perinuclear cellular compartment (Figure S5a–b) and caused a detectable
increase of drug in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm. This suggests
that Pd-mediated prodrug activation leads to enhanced DNA association
of the prodrug (Figure 3c). HPLC fluorescence detection in lysate of treated cells confirmed
a decrease in intracellular prodrug concentration when cells were
co-treated with Pd-NP (Figure S5c–d). Residual cytoplasmic/lysosomal accumulation of C16proDOX
was observed despite Pd-NP co-treatment, although this was also observed
to some degree for DOX treatment as well (Figure 3, S5). These results
suggest successful intracellular activation of C16proDOX
by Pd-NP.

We next studied how C16proMMAE and its
subsequent activation compares to the biological behavior of the parent
compound MMAE, a well understood antimitotic agent that blocks the
polymerization of tubulin and consequently inhibits cell division.
Across a panel of four cancer cell lines, C16proMMAE exhibited
no detectable impact on cell growth at concentrations ≤10 μM
(Figure S6a). However, its co-treatment
with Pd-NP led to cytotoxic responses that closely mirrored those
of the parent compound in terms of both the concentration at which
50% of the effect was observed (IC50) and the maximum inhibitory
effect that was achieved (Emax; Figure 4a–c). Thus,
at the cellular level, C16proMMAE behaves nearly identically
to MMAE once activated by Pd-NP (R2 >
0.95, Figure 4b–c).
Of note, Pd-NP by itself did not detectably impact cell growth at
concentrations up to 50 μM for three of the four tested cell
lines (Figure S6b), consistent with past
reports and its known safety profile.5

Figure 4 Caged
MMAE only disrupts microtubule dynamics in the presence of
Pd-NP in live cancer cells. (a–c) Cytotoxic drug effects were
quantified by a resazurin-based cell viability assay, 72 h post-treatment.
A representative dose–response curve using the ES2 cell line
and MMAE illustrate Emax and IC50 calculations (a; n = 2, mean ± s.e.m.), which
were then compared across multiple cell lines and between treatments
with MMAE vs the combination of 50 μM Pd-NP
and C16proMMAE (b–c; two-tailed t test). See Figure S6 for full data. (d)
HT1080 cells transgenically expressing EB3-mApple were confocally
imaged over time to monitor the dynamics of microtubule plus-end tips
in live cells (left). EB3 microtubule “comets” were
automatically detected and computationally tracked (center; pseudocolored
according to comet speed) following drug treatment. Scale bar, 20
μm. See Movie S1 for representative
movies of all conditions. (e–f) Neither the average number
of tracks detected (e) nor the speed of those tracks moving in cells
(f) substantially changed with either 1 μM C16proMMAE
or 35 μM Pd-NP treatment alone, but both treatments together
eliminated all EB3 comets in a manner similar to the parent uncaged
drug (median ± i.q.r.; 24 h treatment).

To examine C16proMMAE effects at the molecular
level,
we used confocal microscopy of growing microtubule ends as a biomarker
of drug actions in live cells. We engineered the HT1080 cancer cell
line to transgenically express a red fluorescent fusion protein, EB3-mApple.
The end-binding protein 3 (EB3) is also known as microtubule-associated
protein RP/EB family member 3 (MAPRE3) and binds to the plus-end of
growing microtubules (Figure 4d). As a result, EB3-fluorescent protein fusions are widely
used for studying microtubule dynamics in live cells, with plus-ends
visible as microtubule “comets” transiting the cell.17 HT1080-EB3-mApple cells displayed microtubule
comets that were not substantially perturbed by individual treatment
with either Pd-NP or C16proMMAE, either according to microtubule
comet prevalence in cells (Figure 4e) or their growth speed (Figure 4f). However, the combination of both led
to complete elimination of visible comets, just as observed with the
parent compound MMAE. LC/MS analysis confirmed Pd-NP causes generation
of MMAE from the prodrug (Figure S5). Together,
these results suggest that MMAE caging was effective at preventing
microtubule perturbation and that activation by Pd-NP restored its
microtubule disruption capacity (Figure 4; Movie S1).

Safety and Efficacy Using Human Xenograft and Syngeneic Mouse
Models of Cancer
Given the success of Pd-NP in activating
C16proMMAE, we next tested its ability to safely and effectively
treat tumors in two complementary mouse models of cancer: subcutaneous
HT1080 xenograft tumors in nu/nu mice, and MC38 murine colon adenocarcinoma
tumors grown intradermally in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Upon palpable
tumor formation, HT1080-bearing animals were treated with doses of
either Pd-NP, C16proMMAE NP, or the combination of the
two by intravenous injection. It was previously determined that staggering
the administration of Pd-NP and a subsequent prodrug NP administration
by several hours (as opposed to co-injecting both NPs together) could
lead to more selective tumoral accumulation of activated prodrug.5 Indeed, although Pd accumulates in the clearance
organs (liver, spleen, and kidney) in mice bearing HT1080 tumors,
staggered administration of the prodrug NP leads to comparably lower
off-target accumulation of the activated prodrug, especially relative
to levels of prodrug activation in the tumor (Figure S7a).5 Using the prescribed
5 h dose staggering scheme, the dual treatment of Pd-NP and C16proMMAE NP successfully blocked tumor growth (Figure 5a), while animals receiving
either Pd-NP or C16proMMAE NP as single-treatments saw
no change in their tumor growth compared to the untreated cohort (Figure 5a; P > 0.05; also see ref (5). Similarly, combined Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment
was
effective at slowing tumor growth in the MC38 tumor model (Figure 5b). In fact, in both
models tumor growth was completely blocked at 2 days following the
second round of Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment (Figure 5c–d). However,
the treatment was not curative, and a fraction of tumors eventually
resumed growth (individual tumors growth curves are shown in Figure S7b–c).

Figure 5 Dual Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment safely blocks tumor
growth in multiple tumor models. (a–b) HT1080 (a) and MC38
(b) tumors were treated with Pd-NP, C16proMMAE, or the
combination of the two at the indicated time points (red arrows) following
tumor formation. Tumor volumes were monitored over time by caliper
(n ≥ 6, means ± s.e.m.). (c–d)
Changes in individual HT1080 (c) and MC38 (d) tumor volumes were quantified
and compared at day 7 (see (a); n ≥ 6, means
± s.e.m; two-tailed Mann–Whitney test). (e–f) Body
weight was monitored in animals bearing HT1080 (e) or MC38 (f) tumors
following treatment with the combination of Pd-NP and C16proMMAE, showing no significant loss compared to the vehicle control
group (n ≥ 4, means ± s.e.m.). (g) At
the end of the study end point, plasma of MC38 tumor-bearing mice
was analyzed for signs of toxicity, and no significant changes were
observed (n ≥ 4, means ± s.e.m.; two-tailed t test at α = 0.05 significance level).

In vitro tests had demonstrated
C16proMMAE to be a much more potent drug once activated
by Pd-NP, compared
to DOX-based formulations (Figure 2). When compared to previously published results, the
dual treatment with Pd-NP and C16proMMAE performed at least
as well as the combination of Pd-NP and Alloc-DOX NP, even at <2%
the relative molar dose (0.8 μmol kg–1 compared
to 48 μmol kg–1 of prodrug).5 Control experiments using equivalent doses of parent MMAE
were not performed, as it is known to be severely toxic and above
the maximum tolerated dose in mouse models (e.g., see ref (18)). For these reasons, MMAE itself is not a cancer drug candidate
and is only used as an antibody-drug conjugate or nanotherapeutic.
In contrast, animals treated with dual Pd-NP and C16proMMAE
did not show drug-induced weight loss (Figure 5e–f), and blood chemistry analysis
of treated animals showed no signs of drug-induced liver or kidney
toxicity (Figure 5g).
Thus, these results suggest that Pd-mediated activation of C16proMMAE can safely and effectively block tumor growth.

Modeling in Vivo Mechanisms of Dual Nanotherapy
Action
Data reported here and elsewhere indicate that dual
Pd-NP and prodrug-NP strategies can lead to more selective activation
in the tumor compared to traditional solvent- and nanoformulations
of the parent drug. In this work, the dual Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment was effective and well-tolerated. Previously, we
found that dual Pd-NP and Alloc-DOX treatment was similarly safe and
effective (albeit requiring much higher prodrug doses for efficacy).
In past head-to-head experiments using HT1080 xenografts, traditional
solvent- and nanoformulations of active DOX both exhibited myelotoxicity
at equimolar doses, while the dual Pd-NP and Alloc-DOX strategy did
not.5 Others have likewise reported that
traditional DOX nanoencapsulation can fail to prevent myelotoxicity
in mouse models of cancer.19 What mechanisms
enable dual Pd-NP and prodrug treatment to more selectively activate
in the tumor, particularly compared to other traditional nanoformulations?

To address these questions, we developed a computational multicompartment
model of pharmacokinetics and prodrug activation (Figure 6a). As with all such models,
simplifications were made for both practical implementation and manageable
interpretation, and we roughly based our study on prior models used
for pharmacokinetic analysis of biologics and nanomaterials.20−23 The model consists of 27 parameters (12 of which were optimized,
15 fixed from prior experimental data; Table S1), 30 ordinary differential equations (Table S2), and 4 primary organ-level compartments (Figure 6a): the central compartment
(plasma), peripheral tissue (simplified here as the heart, as a representative
example with known drug toxicity concerns), the mononuclear phagocyte
system (simplified here as the liver, which clears a large fraction
of nanomaterials), and the tumor. Following distribution from vessels
into tissue, NPs are taken up by phagocytes in the liver (Kupffer
cells) and tumor (tumor-associated macrophages, TAMs) along with tumor
cells themselves. Importantly, we modeled myeloid phagocytic capacity
as saturable, based on prior data using Pd-NPs5 as well as a host of studies examining the effects of nanomaterial
“loading doses” on the phagocytic clearance of subsequently
administered nanomaterials.24−27 While TAMs were also modeled as saturable, tumor
cells were not, on the basis of published experimental data indicating
the latter accumulate lower NP levels on a per-cell basis, at a slower
rate, and well below their saturation levels achieved in vitro compared to TAMs and Kupffer cells (Table S3 for data and references). Despite differences in particular nanomaterial
properties used in the “loading dose” studies, their
overall findings are relatively consistent (see Table S3). Once taken up into cells, catalytic and prodrug
NPs react to yield active drug. For simplification, degradation was
modeled as gradual transport of NPs from endocytic/lysosomal compartments
into “downstream compartments” that were much less conducive
to drug activation (for instance, as if the prodrug or Pd compound
were metabolized into degradation products).

model accurately reflects the
benefits of the prodrug strategy. (a) Schematic depicting the computational
pharmacokinetic model, with particle colors corresponding to the legend

equations and parameters). (b) Average fit of the computational model

of simulations across n = 24 optimizations. (d) From
data in (c), the modeled ratio of tumor: liver accumulation (n = 24) was compared to the experimentally observed ratio
of tumor:clearance organs (liver, spleen, kidney; see Figure S7a for details; n =
3). Data are means ± s.e.m. (*paired two-tailed t tests).

Parameters in the model were iteratively
fit to 12 features derived
from experimental data, most using the same HT1080 xenograft model
and PLGA-PEG-based nanoformulations described here. In particular,
the model was guided by (i) time-lapse intravital microscopy of nanomaterial
systemic clearance, extravasation, and cellular uptake in HT1080 tumors;
(ii) organ-level biodistribution measured by fluorescence (for fluorochrome-labeled
NPs) and mass spectrometry (e.g.,
for Pd-NP), including in the HT1080 model; (iii) cell-level biodistribution
of fluorescent PLGA-PEG NPs measured by flow cytometry; and (iv) the
relative ratios of catalytic NPs, prodrug NPs, and activated drug
determined by fluorescence and/or mass spectrometry in the HT1080
models and loading dose studies (see Table S3). Overall, an ensemble of model results were compiled that showed
a reasonable fit to the experimental data (Figure 6b), with a median parameter error (21%) roughly
within the biological uncertainty observed across the experimental
data (average standard error 23%, Table S3). Pharmacokinetics and drug activation in the model accurately captured
the time-staggered dosing of the catalyst- and prodrug-NPs (Figure 6c). We performed
a parametric sensitivity analysis to gauge how changing individual
model parameters can influence overall system behavior (Figure S8). From this analysis and an examination
of the simulation results, an important trend was captured: through
the combination of saturable phagocytic clearance in the liver (amplified
through staggered NP administration), and compounded EPR effect in
the tumor, drug activation was observed to be more selective in the
tumor compared to distribution of the catalyst NP or its prodrug NP
substrate (Figure 6d). This trend was matched by experimental biodistribution data in
the HT1080 model (Figure 6d).

Exploiting the Enhanced Reliance on EPR for
Dual Nanotherapy
Action
Perhaps intuitively, the parametric sensitivity analysis
of the computational model (Figure S8)
revealed that the bioorthogonal prodrug strategy relies to an especially
high degree on factors related to the tumor EPR effect. As prime examples,
the model suggests that changes in vascular permeability (Pt) and overall tumor vascularization (St) influence tumoral accumulation of active
drug to a greater degree than accumulation of either the catalytic
or prodrug NPs individually (highlighted in Figure S8). Further experimental data underscores the strategy’s
susceptibility to variable EPR effects. Our recent studies have highlighted
how the EPR effect is highly variable in the HT1080 tumor xenograft
model.28,29 Closer examination of the tumor growth responses
reveals that the dual Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment leads
to the most variable response of any other treatment, including to
all controls, traditional single-nanotherapeutic treatments, and solvent-based
treatments (Figure S7d).

To overcome
this variability, previous reports have shown that single low-dose
tumor irradiation can increase NP accumulation via enhanced vascular permeability, TAM recruitment, and other physiological
effects, and therefore considerably enhance EPR effects and NP efficacy
in solid tumors.30 To further improve efficacy,
we tested whether dual Pd-NP and C16proMMAE NP treatment
could benefit from such an approach. Based on measured impacts of
such irradiation on vascular permeability (Table S3), the computational model predicted an especially responsive
enhancement in drug activation, above the expected ∼2-fold
increase in NP accumulation (Figure 7a). Indeed, HT1080 tumors exhibited greater accumulation
of PLGA-PEG NP in the tumor following conformal 5 Gy γ irradiation
(the curative radiation dose is ∼10× higher), as measured
by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figure 7b) and flow cytometry (Figure 7c). Although local tumor irradiation itself
did not durably control tumor growth (as reported previously, ref (30)), it caused tumors to
dramatically shrink when combined with the Pd-NP and C16proMMAE NP treatment regimen (Figure 7d-e), with no observed weight loss from irradiation
(Figure S7e). Notably, when radiation was
added to the Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment, the tumor
responses no longer exhibited the same degree of heterogeneity that
was seen without radiation (all tumors shrank, Figure S7d). Overall, these results indicate that Pd-mediated
C16proMMAE activation is even more effective when tumors
are conditioned by RT to accumulate greater levels of NPs.

Figure 7 Single low-dose
irradiation enhances delivery and efficacy of dual
Pd-NP and C16proMMAE treatment. (a) Based on published
experimental data (see Table S3), computational
modeling predicts how local 5 Gy irradiation, performed 72 h prior
to NP injection, impacts tumoral NP accumulation and prodrug activation
(n = 24 optimizations; means ± s.e.m.). (b–c)
HT1080 tumor cells and the accumulation of PLGA-PEG NP were compared
with or without irradiation as modeled in (a), shown by confocal fluorescence
microscopy in live tumors (b; n ≥ 3, scale
bar 100 μm), and flow cytometry of excised and digested tumors
(c; n ≥ 4), 24 h post-treatment with NP. (d–e)
HT1080 tumor xenografts were treated as in Figure 6a, but with addition of a single-dose of
5 Gy irradiation locally to the tumor site (un-irradiated groups are
re-shown for reference; n ≥ 5, means ±
s.e.m). Corresponding changes in the volumes of individual tumors
were quantified at day 7 (n ≥ 5, means ±
s.e.m; two-tailed t tests).

Comparison to Prior Prodrug Designs
This report advances
bioorthogonal chemistry applications by enabling multifunctional prodrug
engineering for more efficient in vivo drug action
delivered as NPs. We present a modular design based on a multifunctional
self-immolative linker that allows sterically bulky substituents (here,
the aliphatic C16 anchor) to be designed and utilized for
tuning prodrug properties, while catalytic removal by a bioorthogonal
Pd-NP catalyst (using the Alloc protecting group) efficiently restores
drug activity. Compared to initial efforts in developing Pd-mediated
prodrugs, this strategy led to development of C16proMMAE,
a NP-formulated prodrug with improvements including (i) 100-fold greater
turn-on capacity in cytotoxicity compared to Alloc-DOX (>70,000×
turn-on for C16proMMAE compared to ∼700× for
Alloc-DOX); (ii) a roughly 100-fold greater in vitro potency compared to Alloc-DOX in the presence of Pd-NP; (iii) a
50-fold reduction in the prodrug dose required for controlling tumor
growth in vivo; and (iv) highly efficient and stable
nanoencapsulation properties. The approach is also able to take advantage
of recent discoveries into how local radiation therapy can improve
tumoral NP delivery and action, leading to synergistic response.30 These results, and their comparison with traditional
solvent- and nanoformulations of active drugs, are summarized in Table S4.

Prodrugs based on MMAE have a
successful history in the clinic, largely based on their implementation
in antibody drug conjugates (ADC) such as brentixumab vedotin (Adcetris),
the anti-CD30 ADC used to treat refractory Hodgkin lymphoma among
other indications. Other MMAE-based ADCs are undergoing clinical trials,
while alternative microtubule-disrupting drugs are used in clinically
approved ADCs such as trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla). Although ADCs
have demonstrated an ability to extend survival in patients, they
typically exhibit several drawbacks, primarily dose-limiting toxicities
and incomplete tumor penetration. ADC resistance is still common,
especially in advanced malignancies. Toxicity arises from off-target
ADC uptake; instability of the antibody-drug conjugation, especially
when disulfide and hydrazone bonds are used, leading to systemic drug
exposure; limited drug loading on antibodies; and poor ability to
tightly control and decouple prodrug activation from antibody behavior.
Limited efficacy may be due to low exposure of target cells, which
is inevitable given the high molecular weight of antibodies. The bioorthogonal
prodrug strategy presented here helps address some of these issues.
In general, nanoencapsulation supports far greater prodrug loading
capacity compared to antibodies. Use of a catalyst for prodrug activation
offers the possibility of substoichiometric reactions, while use of
a distinct bioorthogonal trigger (here, Pd-NP) can provide greater
control over when and where the prodrug becomes activated, especially
compared to prodrugs that rely on endogenous and often widely expressed
enzymatic reactions, such as cathepsin proteases relied on by many
ADCs.

Future Directions
The prodrug design concept presented
in this work is especially suited for combinatorial NP delivery strategies,
although other bioconjugation strategies (for instance, to antibodies
or targeted small molecules) may be feasible. In principle, the C16 anchor could be replaced with other nanoencapsulation anchors,
linkers to different types of molecular targeting entities, or other
therapeutic payloads. In the context of Pd-NP bioorthogonal catalysis,
nanoencapsulation has been shown to improve the stability, solubility,
and selective in vivo delivery;5 future studies may use the technology developed here to
explore bioorthogonal catalysis with more advanced nanoformulations,
such as those which are molecularly targeted, environmentally responsive,
based on implanted biomaterial scaffolds, or incorporated into adoptively
transferred cell therapies.

Given that our strategy requires
accumulation of two different NPs in tumors, it is highly dependent
on tumor uptake via the EPR effect, and this is underscored
by the computational pharmacokinetic modeling results. Patients vary
in how well their tumors accumulate NPs, but personalization of therapy
may be feasible using biomarkers of NP uptake.31 For instance, recent work has highlighted how an FDA-approved
magnetic NP, ferumoxytol (Feraheme), can be used as an MRI contrast
agent and companion diagnostic to identify tumors with high EPR and
to predict corresponding nanomedicine response.28 This approach has been especially promising in predicting
the clinical activity of a liposomal formulation of the prodrug irinotecan
(Onivyde), which was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of
refractory pancreatic cancer.32 Along these
lines, local low-dose tumor irradiation, as used here, can enhance
the EPR effect in a manner detectable by ferumoxytol imaging and leads
to synergistic responses.29

Conclusions
Here we present DOX and MMAE as two proof-of-principle drugs with
which to apply the prodrug strategy, both containing primary amines
that are important for their function. Their broad and proven clinical
activity in treating cancer, combined with well understood mechanisms
of action and dose-limiting systemic toxicities, motivated their use
in this application. Furthermore, the endogenous fluorescence of DOX
provided some insight into its intracellular distribution as a prodrug,
its co-localization with Pd-NP, and its subsequently enhanced association
with DNA once activated. In future work, the prodrug design has the
potential to extend beyond antimitotic drugs and apply to a variety
of therapeutics, including immunomodulatory agents, targeted inhibitors,
and radiopharmaceuticals. Our data indicated that the C16 nanoencapsulation anchor was important in blocking biological (i.e., cytotoxic) effects of the prodrug
and influenced subcellular distribution. The modular design strategy
of the approach theoretically allows for further optimization and
modification of the C16 anchor, especially for application
to different drug payloads acting in different subcellular compartments.

Cell Lines and Animal Models
All animal research was
performed in accordance with guidelines from the Institutional Subcommittee
on Research Animal Care. HT1080 xenografts were generated by 2 ×
106 cells implanted subcutaneously in flanks of 6–8
week old female nu/nu mice (Cox7/MGH) in 50 μL PBS. MC38 syngeneic
tumors were formed by intradermal implantation of 2 × 106 cells in 50 μL PBS, in the flanks of 7–12 week
old female C57BL/6 mice (JAX), following previously described inoculation
protocols.33 Four blinded caliper measurements
per tumor were used to measure tumor size according to the formula V = (width)2(length)/2; animals were randomly
assigned to treatment groups. Experiments were built on prior imaging,
biodistribution, and longitudinal tumor growth data that likewise
guided determination of experimental sample sizes.5,30 Treatment
began approximately 3 weeks post-implantation once tumors reached
an average diameter of 5.5 ± 1.8 mm in the HT1080 model (mean
± std. dev.; n = 72) and roughly 2 weeks post-implantation
in the MC38 model once tumors reached an average diameter of 5.45
± 1.2 mm (mean ± std. dev.; n = 14). Study
results were pooled across independent cohorts (n ≥ 2), therefore sample sizes of some control groups are over-represented.
Drug-free NP vehicle controls were used throughout, and nanoformulations
were freshly prepared prior to injection. Treatments were 0.8 μmol
kg–1 C16proMMAE, 50 mg kg–1 Pd-NP, or a combination of the two staggered by 5 h on the same
day, all by tail-vein injection in 50 μL PBS, on the indicated
days. Following pre-established criteria, mice were sacrificed when
tumor burden reached more than 1 cm in diameter, or 2 cm in diameter
if only one tumor was present, or according to a body condition score
of 2. Drug-induced weight loss did not exceed 10% in any treatment
group. Blood chemistry readouts were measured from plasma collected
in heparinized tubes by terminal cardiac puncture under vaporized
isoflurane anesthesia, using the MGH Veterinary Clinical Pathology
lab and the automated DriChem blood chemistry analyzer (Heska). The
HT1080 cell line was obtained directly from ATCC, was cultured according
to the provider’s guidelines, was not independently verified,
and underwent routine mycoplasma testing. Transgenic cell lines were
generated as described previously.5 EB3-mApple
cells were generated by transfection and repeated rounds of sorting
by FACS. The construct mApple-EB3-7 was a gift from Michael Davidson
(Addgene plasmid # 54892). For all procedures, mice were anesthetized
with an isoflurane vaporizer on a heated stage, euthanasia was performed
by CO2 chamber when necessary, and all treatment groups
underwent procedures and monitoring consecutively on the same day
when possible, but in a randomized order.

Nanoformulation and Characterization
C16proMMAE and C16proDOX nanoformulations
were synthesized
by nanoprecipitation by first combining 0.1 mg prodrug, 5 mg PLGA(75:25
lactide:glycolide)8.3 kDa-PEG5.5 kDa (Advanced Polymer Materials, Inc.; by manufacturer, 70% functionality
by 1H NMR, PI 1.38 according to GPC), and 1 mg PLGA(50:50
lactide:glycolide)30–60 kDa (Sigma) in a 212
μL mixture of 1:1 dimethylformamide (DMF):acetonitrile (MeCN),
then added dropwise to 20 mL H2O under stirring at room
temperature for 4 h, then filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose
acetate syringe filter (Cole-Parmer), and concentrated in Amicon 100
kDa molecular-weight-cutoff centrifugal filters (Millipore) spun at
3000g for 30 min. Initial experiments determined
up to 1 mg of C16 prodrug could be used with the same polymer
composition with no detectable loss in loading efficiency. For fluorescence-based
imaging and flow-cytometric detection of NP uptake, PLGA-BODIPY630
was used instead of PLGA (described previously).5 NP drug and Pd compound loadings were determined by absorbance
(Nanodrop spectrophotometer), interpolation from a standard curve
(R2 > 0.99) after 1:10 dilution in
DMF.
Size and ζ potential measurements were performed using dynamic
light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer). Prodrug loading efficiency is
defined as the fraction of initial drug used in the nanoprecipitation
reaction that was successfully encapsulated and recovered in final
NP product.

TEM was performed at the Microscopy Core of the
Center for Systems Biology/Program in Membrane Biology (MGH). A JEOL
1011 electron microscope was used for TEM, with sample preparation
by deposition of 20 μL NP (1.0 mg mL–1) onto
a carbon-coated copper grid. Excess solution was blotted, grids were
stained with phosphotungstic acid, and then blotted, dried, and imaged. In vitro NP prodrug release was performed by incubating
in PBS at 37 °C, separating NPs using a 30 kDa molecular weight
cutoff filter (Millipore Amicon) after 72 h, and measuring flow-through
for drug content by absorbance (Nanodrop). NP was dissolved in DMF
and also measured for drug content by absorbance. Pd-NP, Alloc2R110 and its nanoformulation, and all Pd compounds were synthesized
and characterized as previously described.5

In Vitro NP Characterization
For cytotoxicity
assessment, 5000 cells per well were added to 96-well plates; cells
were treated after overnight seeding with compound or the appropriate
buffer control (drug-free PLGA-PEG NP) and assessed for viability
72 h later using PrestoBlue (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s
protocol.

For in vitro C16proDOX
and DOX quantification, 15 cm confluent plates of HT1080 cells were
washed 3× in PBS, lysed using 100 μL lysis buffer (150
mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, Roche complete protease inhibitor,
pH 8.0), and drug was extracted as described.34 Concentrations were fit from integrated fluorescence chromatography
as before, using linear approximation as deemed appropriate from reference
standards of purified DOX and C16 solutions, correcting
for fluorescence efficiencies between C16proDOX and DOX.5 Cells were treated with 1 μM DOX or C16proDOX and/or 70 μM Pd-NP for 24 h. C16proMMAE
activation was detected by incubation of 20 μM C16proMMAE with 60 μM Pd-NP in DMF for 24 h at 37 °C.

Microtubule
Imaging
EB3 tracking was performed using
an FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope on a 37 °C heated
stage, with XLUMPLFLN 20× (NA 1.0) or LUMFLN 60× (NA 1.1)
water-immersion objectives, 1–10× digital zoom, 559 nm
diode laser, and BA575–620 emission filter (all Olympus America).
Cells were treated with 1 μM MMAE, C16proMMAE, and/or
35 μM Pd-NP for 24 h prior to imaging. EB3 tracks were automatically
identified and analyzed from time-lapse data sets using u-track software,35 with tuning of maximum gap number and minimum
frame number across data sets to account for differences in image
quality; ambiguous and spurious tracks and artifacts were excluded
according to requirements for directional continuity (directional
persistence as net displacement/path length >0.8) and movement
(value
>3 pixels). Speed was determined between frames in each track and
averaged for each track by computing the mean of the middle 80% of
between-frame values. Track overlay figures were produced using a
custom python script. Averaged track speeds excluded outliers falling
more than 1.5× the interquartile range for each biological replicate.

In Vitro NP Uptake Imaging
To quantify
subcellular localization of NPs in HT1080 cells, Rab7a-RFP and Lamp1-RFP
fusion constructs were expressed using a commercial baculovirus platform
(CellLight BacMam 2.0, Invitrogen), following manufacturing guidelines.
Pharmacological modulation of NP uptake was performed using the following:
staurosporine (1 μM; LC laboratories), latrunculin B (1 μM;
Tocris), cytochalasin D (1 μM; Sigma), chloroquine (50 μM;
Sigma), and ethylisopropyl amiloride EIPA (100 μM; Tocris).
Cells were rinsed in fresh media immediately prior to imaging; only
adherent cells were quantified. Chloroquine dose–response measurements
were normalized to the C16proDOX control (rather than the
chloroquine-free control), in order to compare relative effects on
the potency of Pd-mediated C16proDOX activation itself.
50 μM chloroquine alone caused a 15–30% decrease in cell
viability.

Flow Cytometry and Confocal Tumor Imaging
Subcutaneous
HT1080 tumors were harvested 3 weeks post-implantation and 24 h post-treatment
with 3 mg kg–1 PLGA-PEG therapeutic NPs14 encapsulated with PLGA-BODIPY630 as a validated
near-infrared label of NP uptake, administered by tail-vein injection
in 50 μL PBS. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging are described
previously.30 Single-cell quantification
of NP uptake was performed in bilateral subcutaneous tumors, matched
such that one tumor received 5 Gy local γ irradiation 72 h prior
to NP administration. Following animal sacrifice at 24 h post-injection,
single-cell suspensions of resected tumors were stained for tumor
cells (CD45-hCD29+) using CD45 (BD 30-F11) and hCD29 (BD MAR4) antibodies,
and single-cell NP uptake was measured by the mean fluorescence intensity
of gated cells on an LSRII flow cytometer. Confocal tumor imaging
was performed on mice bearing subcutaneous HT1080 tumors under a dorsal
window chamber as previously described;36 tumor cells were subcutaneously injected 30 min after surgical chamber
implantation, and imaged and irradiated 2 weeks later.

Radiation Therapy
Dual source 137Cs Gammacell
40 Exactor (Best Theratronics) with a custom-built lead shield was
used for conformal tumor irradiation, using a setup described previously.30 Immediately prior to RT, mice were anesthetized via 87.5 mg/kg ketamine and 12.5 mg/kg xylazine i.p., immobilized
in the lead shielding chamber, and irradiated individually according
to the calibrated dose rate of 0.6 Gy min–1.

Biodistribution
Accumulation of palladium and prodrug
NP in tissues was assessed as previously described, shown here as
a combined ratiometric analysis presented relative to tumor concentrations.
All measurements were determined 24 h post-treatment with Pd-NP in
HT1080 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice, as used throughout. Palladium
biodistribution was determined by an Agilant 7500 Series ICP-MS, fitting
to a 9-point standard curve and using Pd ICP standard solution. Biodistribution
of prodrug NP vehicle and activation was quantified by Olympus OV110
fluorescence reflectance imaging of freshly excised tissue that had
been rinsed in PBS. For a model prodrug NP, PLGA-PEG nanoformulation
encapsulating the near-infrared NP label PLGA-BODIPY630 and the model
Pd-NP substrate Alloc2R110 were used, all as described
and characterized previously.5 Fluorescence
intensity values were calculated from regions of interest defined
manually in ImageJ, after correcting for background autofluorescence.
Measurements were averaged according to the mean across n = 3 replicates, and calculated concentrations were divided by the
average concentrations observed in the tumor. To compare tumor levels
to concentrations seen in clearance organs, tumor levels were divided
by the pooled average concentrations observed across the liver, spleen,
and kidney.

Computational Pharmacokinetic Modeling
The multicompartment
model was developed based on custom Matlab scripts and was simulated
using the ordinary differential equation solver ode15s. Parameters
were optimized according to iterative and stochastically sampled rounds
of bounded optimization. The cost function consisted of experimentally
measured features of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (Table S3), and n = 24 optimization
runs were computed based on stochastic initial parameter values and
cost functions with slightly different weights on each of these features.
Average modeling results were then tabulated from the 24 optimizations.
The final model was generated after iterative rounds of increasing
the model complexity and compartments (e.g., through the use of saturable phagocytic uptake) to better
fit the experimental data, until yielding sufficiently accurate results.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed
using Prism (GraphPad), MATLAB (Mathworks), and Excel (Microsoft).
Measurement statistics and error bars are described in the figure
legends. Two-tailed tests were used with false-positive thresholds
of α = 0.05.
