RNA (mRNA) is a promising tool for biotherapeutics, and
self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) is particularly advantageous, because
it results in abundant protein expression and production is easily
scalable. While mRNA therapeutics have been shown to be highly effective
in small animals, the outcomes do not scale linearly when these formulations
are translated to dose-escalation studies in humans. Here, we utilize
a design of experiments (DoE) approach to optimize the formulation
of saRNA lipid nanoparticles in human skin explants. We first observed
that luciferase expression from saRNA peaked after 11 days in human
skin. Using DoE inputs of complexing lipid identity, lipid nanoparticle
dose, lipid concentration, particle concentration, and ratio of zwitterionic
to cationic lipids, we optimized the saRNA-induced luciferase expression
in skin explants. Lipid identity and lipid concentration were found
to be significant parameters in the DoE model, and the optimized formulation
resulted in ∼7-fold increase in luciferase expression, relative
to initial 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) formulation.
Using flow cytometry, we observed that optimized formulations delivered
the saRNA to ∼2% of the resident cells in the human skin explants.
Although immune cells comprise only 7% of the total population of
cells in skin, immune cells were found to express ∼50% of the
RNA. This study demonstrates the powerful combination of using a DoE
approach paired with clinically relevant human skin explants to optimize
nucleic acid formulations. We expect that this system will be useful
for optimizing both formulation and molecular designs of clinically
translational nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics.

Messenger
RNA (mRNA) has emerged
as a versatile and advantageous tool for both vaccine and protein
replacement therapeutics. RNA has several beneficial features over
DNA and protein therapeutics; mRNA is noninfectious and nonintegrating,
and the degradation of mRNA by normal cellular processes can be modulated
through modifications and delivery vehicles.1−4 mRNA is the minimal genetic vector,
and, thus, antivector immunity is avoided, even after repeated administration.
Furthermore, mRNA is known to have adjuvanting properties induced
by activation of innate sensing mechanisms, such as toll-like receptors
(TLRs) and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors.5,6 Recently,
self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) has been investigated as the next-generation
approach for mRNA therapeutics. saRNA vectors are derived from the
alphavirus genome7 and self-replicate upon
delivery into cytoplasm, resulting in abundant protein expression
and thus minimizing the required doses of RNA.8−10

Because
mRNA therapeutics are negatively charged and not readily
taken up into cells, they must be formulated with a delivery vehicle
in order to enable efficient cellular uptake and expression. Previous
formulations have included liposomes,11,12 polyplexes,13,14 and emulsions,15,16 typically with a cationic lipid
or polymer used to complex/condense the RNA. Preclinical formulations
are generally optimized in vitro or in vivo in small animal models,
such as mice or rats, in order to assess the effectiveness prior to
human clinical trials. Kauffman et al. used an innovative in vivo
design of experiments (DoE) approach to optimize the expression of
liposome-formulated erythropoietin (EPO)-encoding mRNA, which showed
7-fold greater protein expression.17 However,
when the same formulation was used to deliver siRNA, no enhancement
was observed, emphasizing the importance of optimizing each formulation
based on the platform and indication.

While mRNA therapeutics
have shown promising results in vivo in
many small animal models, the transition to humans is poor. For example,
Bahl et al. observed remarkable hemagglutinin (HA) inhibition titers
in mice (100–1000), ferrets (∼10 000), and nonhuman
primates (∼10 000) for HA proteins H10N8- and H7N9-encoding
mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).18 However, in the corresponding first-in-human, escalating-dose
phase I clinical trial, the HAI titer was merely <100. The reason
for this inconsistency is unclear; perhaps it is because both the
molecular and formulation components of mRNA therapeutics are optimized
in models that are somewhat irrelevant to humans. While small animal
models will likely always have a role in preclinical studies, we hypothesize
that inherent differences in human innate sensing and tissue architecture
pose a barrier to the translation of RNA therapeutics from the laboratory
to the clinic. Because of these potential differences between humans
and small animal models, we sought to optimize the formulated delivery
of saRNA in a relevant human tissue. van den Berg et al. previously
optimized a tattooed DNA vaccine in human skin explants;19 however, to our knowledge, this approach has
not been previously applied to optimization of mRNA formulations.

Here, we present the optimization of LNP formulations of saRNA
in human skin explants, using a DoE approach to maximize protein expression.
We first characterized the temporal kinetics of firefly luciferase
(fLuc) in human skin explants. Four complexing lipids were chosen,
because of their previous use in nucleic acid formulations, including
C12–200 (ionizable), dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide [(DDA),
cationic], 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane [(DOTAP), cationic]
and cephalin (zwitterionic). We used input parameters of complexing
lipid, LNP dose, lipid concentration, particle concentration, and
ratio of cationic to zwitterionic lipid, and a response variable of
luciferase expression in human skin explants. Upon completion of the
DoE, we used flow cytometry to confirm whether the LNP formulations
enhanced saRNA delivery to the cells using GFP expression as a proxy.
Finally, we characterized which resident cell types of the human skin
explants were taking up and expressing saRNA.

Results and Discussion
A depiction of the lipid nanoparticle composition and complexing
lipids is shown in Scheme 1. saRNA was adsorbed to the outside of LNPs, using a variety
of complexing lipids, including ionizable (C12–200), cationic
(DDA, DOTAP), and zwitterionic (cephalin) lipids. We used a DoE approach
to optimize the luciferase-encoding saRNA delivery into human skin
explants by varying different aspects of the formulation, including
the complexing lipid, lipid concentration, particle concentration,
and the ratio of zwitterionic to cationic lipid. We then assessed
whether the enhanced luciferase expression was due to the quantity
of cellular uptake, or enhanced expression in individual cells, and
then characterized the identity of the skin cells that were expressing
saRNA.

saRNA Luciferase Expression Kinetics in Human Skin Explants
While the kinetic profile of saRNA luciferase expression in mice
has been well-characterized,9 we first
sought to determine the peak expression of saRNA in human skin explants.
A single tissue explant was treated with three separate injections,
given simultaneously, containing a dose of 10 μg of fLuc saRNA
complexed with DOTAP LNPs at a ratio of total lipid to RNA of 4:1
(w/w) and imaged over the course of 21 days (Figure 1). Quantification of the luciferase activity
reveals that a signal is visible after only 24 h (∼40 000
p/s), peaks at day 11 (∼235 000 p/s), but persists for
at least 21 days (Figure 1b). Tissue culture and imaging was discontinued after 21 days,
because of a visible decline in tissue viability (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). As
evidenced in Figure 1a, the bleb caused by intradermal (ID) injection of the formulation
was not confined to the initial injection space, but rather spreads
out across the tissue, which had a volume of ∼3 cm2. Thus, for future explant experiments, the tissue was cut into smaller
volumes (1 cm2) in order to maintain the intended number
of replicates. Furthermore, luciferase quantification for the DoE
samples was performed only at 10 days, because this timing was determined
to be best-suited to distinguish differences in formulation delivery.
van den Berg et al. found that luciferase expression peaked in human
skin 24 h after delivery via DNA tattooing, and was depleted by 72
h,19 likely because of high turnover of
the epidermis or gene silencing.20 We hypothesized
that the smaller volume of our tissue explants improved the viability,
and the amplifying nature of saRNA yielded a delayed maximum signal.
The observed kinetics of saRNA-induced fLuc expression in human skin
is similar to the profile observed after intramuscular (IM) injection
in mice, wherein the peak expression occurs between 7 and 14 days.9 The prolonged viability of human skin explants
in these experiments enabled us to optimize LNP formulations for saRNA
delivery.

Effects of Complexing Lipid
Identity and Lipid-to-RNA Ratio
on Luciferase Expression
We first optimized the complexing
lipid identity and the ratio of total lipid to RNA on saRNA-induced
luciferase expression in human skin explants. We chose a range of
complexing lipids to include in the DoE, since they had previously
been used in liposomal nucleic acid formulations, including C12–200,17,21 cephalin,22 DDA,23,24 and DOTAP.25 As shown in Figure 2a, cephalin LNPs were found
to have the highest luciferase expression (∼40 000 p/s).
C12–200, DDA and DOTAP LNPs had peak luciferase expression
of ∼20 000 p/s (Figure 2b). These experiments yielded lower luciferase expression
than those presented in Figure 1, because of a lower dose of saRNA and decreased surface area
of the skin explant utilized for the DoE. Interestingly, C12–200,
cephalin, and DOTAP LNPs were found to have increasing luciferase
expression with increasing ratio of lipids to RNA, but DDA had similar
luciferase expression levels for all three tested ratios (1:1, 4:1,
18:1 (w/w)). We hypothesize that this occurs because DDA complexes
the saRNA more efficiently than the other lipids, and thus the DDA
LNPs were not saturated with saRNA at a ratio of 18:1 (w/w). C12–200
and DOTAP have previously been used in siRNA21,26 and mRNA17,22,27 delivery, but these lipids have never been formulated in similar
LNPs and systematically compared. While both DOTAP and DDA have quaternary,
cationic amines, DDA has only two methyl groups and DOTAP has three,
which potentially accounts for the more-efficient complexation of
DDA LNPs to the saRNA. Zwitterionic lipids such as cephalin are typically
used as helper lipids to stabilize liposomes,28,29 in addition to a cationic lipid that complexes the nucleic acid;
however, it has been previously observed that increasing the helper
lipid composition of the liposome enhances liposome fusion efficiency.30 We were interested to evaluate the role of cephalin
as a complexing lipid, because it represents a very different class
of molecule with a different headgroup and tail saturation. We hypothesize
that the primary amine on cephalin is able to directly complex the
saRNA, and the comparatively higher molar composition of the cephalin
LNPs enhance the fusion of these particles to the human skin cells,
resulting in higher luciferase expression. Particle size and charge
was not included as an input into the DoE, since this was variable
between the formulations (Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information); however, the impact of these characteristics
on protein expression warrants future studies. Based on these observations,
we used a ratio of total lipid to RNA of 18:1 (w/w) for further experimentation
and completion of the DoE.

imaging of explants after 11 days and (b) quantification of luciferase
imagine expressed as the mean total flux (p/s) ± standard deviation
for n = 5.

Effects of Lipid and Particle Concentration on Luciferase Expression
Because we observed that increasing the total ratio of lipids to
RNA generally increased the luciferase expression in human skin explants,
we then sought to determine whether increasing either the particle
or lipid concentration would further enhance luciferase expression.
We prepared batches of LNPs with high lipid and particle concentration
(H[L]/H[P]) or high lipid and low particle concentration (H[L]/L[P])
for each of the complexing lipids. The high and low particle concentrations
were defined as 109 and 107 particles/mL, respectively,
while the high lipid concentration was defined as 7.5 mg/mL. Using
a ratio of total lipids to RNA of 90:1 (w/w), human skin explants
were injected ID and quantified for luciferase expression (Figure 3a). We observed that,
for cephalin, DDA, and DOTAP LNPs, the H[L]/H[P] formulation had enhanced
luciferase expression, compared to the H[L]/L[P] formulation (Figure 3b), although there
was no difference in the C12–200 formulations. The H[L]/H[P]
cephalin LNPs had the highest luciferase expression (∼25 000
p/s), followed by the cationic H[L]/H[P] DDA and DOTAP LNPs (∼20 000
p/s) and finally the ionizable C12–200 LNPs (∼10 000
p/s). Despite this trend, the luciferase expression of the cephalin
LNPs with low lipid concentration and medium particle concentration
(Figure 2) was greater
than any of the H[L]/H[P] or H[L]/L[P] formulations, emphasizing that,
for the formulations of LNPs, a lower ratio of lipid to RNA is more
optimal. We observed slight aggregation of H[L]/H[P] LNPs upon addition
of saRNA, and we postulate that this phenomenon is due to exceeding
the critical concentration of RNA in the particles, wherein the abrupt
addition of RNA to a more highly concentrated particle environment
causes aggregation. This observation is similar to previous formulations
with polyplexes and saRNA, wherein increasing the ratio of saRNA to
cationic polymer results in an aggregation of particles, but this
has not been previously reported for LNP formulations of saRNA.31 These experiments confirm the optimized LNP
formulation to be low lipid and medium particle concentrations.

is defined as 7.5 mg/mL. H[L]/H[P] denotes high lipid concentration
and high particle concentration; H[L]/L[P] denotes high lipid concentration
and low particle concentration.

Effects of Combining Zwitterionic and Cationic Complexing Lipids
on Luciferase Expression
After observing the higher luciferase
expression from LNPs with a single cationic or zwitterionic complexing
lipid (Figure 2), we
prepared formulations of combinations of cationic and zwitterionic
lipids with varying ratios from 10:1 to 0.1:1 while maintaining the
low lipid concentration and medium particle concentration. We observed
that, generally, the DDA/cephalin LNPs had higher luciferase expression
(∼25 000 p/s) than the DOTAP/cephalin LNPs (∼10 000
p/s) (Figure 4). These
trends are similar to the formulations, wherein only a single complexing
lipid was included (Figure 2). There was no added benefit to combining cationic and zwitterionic
lipids into a single LNP. In addition, even the LNP formulations that
were primarily cephalin (0.1:1) had lower luciferase expression than
the cephalin alone, indicating that combining cationic and zwitterionic
lipids is detrimental for saRNA delivery. We postulate that this could
be because including cationic lipids alters the net charge of the
particles, as shown in Figure S1, thus
limiting the cephalin-aided fusion of the particles into cells, reducing
uptake. However, this hypothesis warrants further studies to confirm
whether this is the case, or if incorporating the cationic lipid complexes
irreversibly to the saRNA, rendering it functionally useless within
the cytoplasm.

Design of Experiments (DoE) Analysis
The DoE approach
allows for exploration and characterization of the three-dimensional
formulation space in order to identify optimal parameters for saRNA
formulation. This approach paired with human skin explants is a clinically
relevant way to optimize formulations, as tissue is readily available
to facilitate the large number of samples required for an exhaustive
full factorial DoE, and ID injections are a clinically viable route
of administration for RNA vaccines.32,33 Using input
parameters of complexing lipid identity (C12–200, cephalin,
DDA, DOTAP), ratio of total lipid to RNA, lipid concentration, particle
concentration, and ratio of cationic to zwitterionic lipid and luciferase
expression as the response, we used standard least-squares effect
screening to construct a model of which input parameters significantly
impact luciferase expression in human skin explants (Figure 5). Our model had a correlation
coefficient (R2) of 0.55, with p = 0.0043 for the experimental versus predicted luciferase
expression. We found that lipid identity and lipid concentration were
the only significant factors. In particular, cephalin lipid identity
had the strongest effect, with p = 0.0018. To further
visualize the design space, we plotted the fold change of luciferase
expression when compared to the original DOTAP LNPs administered at
a total lipid-to-RNA ratio of 1:1 (w/w) (see Figure 6). A value of 1 indicates no enhancement
of luciferase expression. Cephalin LNPs with a ratio of total lipids
to RNA of 18:1 (w/w), low lipid concentration, and medium particle
concentration yielded a 7-fold increase in luciferase expression over
the original formulation. This observation emphasizes the importance
of optimizing the formulation and evidence the practicality of a DoE
approach. Previous approaches for DoE optimization of liposomal-formulated
mRNA delivery found that the ratio of ionizable lipid to mRNA and
the identity of the phospholipid were significant factors in enhancing
delivery to the liver.17 They postulated
that increasing the surface charge of the particles enhanced interaction
with the cell membrane and resulted in increased particulate uptake.34 While the ratio of complexing lipid to saRNA
was not statistically significant in this model, this is likely due
to the DDA LNPs having similar luciferase expression at the tested
doses. Cephalin is known to associate with lipid bilayers and cell
membranes35 and, thus, may lightly complex
to saRNA and facilitate membrane fusion of the LNPs. We showed that
luciferase expression in human skin explants is influenced by the
complexing lipid identity and the lipid concentration, and the DoE
optimization performed in these experiments resulted in a 7-fold increase
in protein expression.

LNP Delivery and Expression of eGFP saRNA
in Human Skin Cells
In order to confirm that our LNP formulations
were enhancing the
delivery of saRNA into human skin cells within the explant, we used
saRNA encoding eGFP and flow cytometry to further investigate these
observations. Our main question was whether the LNP formulations were
increasing the total number of cells that the saRNA was being expressed
in, or whether they were simply facilitating a higher copy number
of saRNA per cell, which would result in increased eGFP intensity
signal per cell. Based on the results from the DoE, we used each of
the LNP formulations with individual complexing lipids, as well as
the cephalin H[L]/H[P] and cephalin H[L]/L[P] LNPs in order to account
for all the input variables. In keeping with the luciferase expression,
we observed that cephalin LNPs resulted in the highest increase in
GFP expression (Figure 7a). Furthermore, cephalin LNPs had the highest total number of cells
(∼2.5%) expressing GFP (Figure 7b), which was significantly increased above RNA only,
which has previously been shown to induce protein expression sans
formulation.36 While the DDA and DOTAP
LNPs had higher average percentages of GFP-positive cells, they were
not statistically significantly more than RNA only, and there was
no increase in the total number of GFP-positive cells with the C12–200,
cephalin H[L]/H[P], or cephalin H[L]/L[P] formulations. The RNA only
did result in increased GFP intensity above the background (Figure 7a), there is a slight
shift in GFP intensity from each of the LNP formulations on a per
cell basis, indicating that the LNPs all facilitate increased total
amount of saRNA per cell, while the cephalin, DDA, and DOTAP LNPs
also increased the total number of positive cells. While the cellular
uptake has not been previously characterized for LNP formulations
of saRNA, a previous study revealed a similar increase in the number
of cells expressing GFP in human skin explants for a pDNA construct
transfected into the cells using a tattoo device.19 It has not yet been defined whether a higher percentage
of cells taking up and/or expressing saRNA enhances the immunogenicity
of the formulation, and whether there is a balance between RNA expression
and innate activation. These results confirm the luciferase DoE results
and emphasize the potential for enhanced delivery by increasing the
total number of cells affected by saRNA formulations.

skin cells after intradermal injection

of number of cells expressing GFP for each formulation, and (b) percentage
of GFP-positive cells of total live cells for each sample. Bar represents
the average ± standard deviation, with a significance of α
= 0.05 indicated by an asterisk (*).

Identification of Cells Expressing eGFP in Human Skin Cells
Given the relatively low number of cells observed to be expressing
GFP in the human skin explants, we then sought to identify which resident
cells are present in the explants and which ones actually express
the RNA (see Figure 8, as well as Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information). We identified which cells were resident in human skin
explants, using a flow cytometry panel capable of identifying epithelial
cells (CD45-), fibroblasts (CD90+), NK cells (CD56+), leukocytes (CD45+),
Langerhans cells (CD1a+), monocytes (CD14+), dendritic cells (CD11c+),
and T cells (CD3+). We found that all of these cells were resident
in human skin explants (Figure 8a), and that the majority of cells (93%) are epithelial cells
(82.6%) and fibroblasts (10.4%). The immune cells comprised only 7%
of the total skin population, which is composed of 0.45% NK cells,
1.33% leukocytes, 3.78% Langerhans cells, 0.24% monocytes, 0.79% dendritic
cells, and 0.41% T cells, assuming that the flow cytometry preparation
did not bias the presence of any cell types. Interestingly, however,
the immune cells comprise a low percentage of the total resident skin
cells; they were found be ∼50% of the GFP-expressing cell population
(Figure 8b). This observation
was true for both formulated and unformulated RNA, with the order
of expression as follows: epithelial cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans
cells, monocytes, leukocytes, fibroblasts, T cells, and NK cells.
We did not observe differences in the cell-viability-tested LNP formulations
(see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).
These results indicate that the resident skin immune cells preferentially
take up and/or express saRNA, despite formulation. These findings
agree strongly with a previous study, which observed that monocytes
and dendritic cells were the main cell types that express mRNA after
intramuscular or ID injection in rhesus macaques.37 While the results are consistent, future work is warranted
to investigate whether uptake and expression into the plethora of
epithelial cells and fibroblasts present in the skin can be enhanced
by tailoring the formulation, and whether this would lead to enhanced
overall protein expression. Furthermore, it remains to be defined
whether preferential uptake by immune cells enhances the immunogenicity
of saRNA vaccines and therapeutics, and is likely dependent on the
indication of the injection. For example, it may be more beneficial
to target immune cells in the context of saRNA vaccines for the prevention
of infectious diseases, as opposed to protein replacement therapies.

skin explants, and (b) identity of GFP-expressing skin cells from

Conclusions
Here, we optimize LNP formulations of saRNA
in human skin explants
using a DoE approach. Skin explants were cultured for up to 3 weeks
and showed luciferase expression after 24 h, which peaked at 10 days.
Of the tested input parameters of lipid identity, including cationic
(DDA, DOTAP), ionizable (C12–200), and zwitterionic (cephalin)
lipids, the ratio of total lipid to RNA, lipid concentration, particle
concentration, and ratio of cationic to zwitterionic lipid, only the
lipid identity and lipid concentration significantly affected the
saRNA-induced luciferase expression in human skin. Despite general
use as a “helper lipid” in LNP formulations, cephalin
was found to be the most effective complexing lipid. The DoE enabled
a 7-fold increase in luciferase expression, compared to the original
formulation. Flow cytometry revealed that all of the formulations
enhanced the eGFP expression in human skin cells and paralleled the
enhanced delivery with cephalin, DDA, and DOTAP LNPs observed with
luciferase imaging studies. Finally, while epithelial cells and fibroblasts
were found to comprise the majority of the resident skin cell population,
the immune cells were found to express more of the administered RNA,
with respect to their proportion of the total cell population. This
study demonstrates the powerful combination of using a DoE approach
paired with clinically relevant human skin explants to optimize nucleic
acid formulations. We expect that this system will be useful for optimizing
both formulation and molecular designs of clinically translational
nucleic acid vaccines and therapeutics.

Methods
RNA Synthesis
and Purification
Self-amplifying RNA
derived from the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) encoding
either firefly luciferase (fLuc) or enhanced green fluorescent protein
(eGFP) was prepared using in vitro transcription.
pDNA was transformed in Escherichia coli and cultured
in 50 mL of LB with 1 mg/mL carbenicillin (Sigma–Aldrich, U.K.)
and isolated using a Plasmid Plus Maxiprep kit (QIAGEN, U.K.). pDNA
concentration and purity was measured on a NanoDrop One (ThermoFisher,
U.K.) and then linearized using MluI for 2 h at 37 °C and heat
inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min. Uncapped in vitro RNA transcripts
were synthesized using 1 μg of linearized DNA template in a
MEGAScript reaction (Promega, U.K.), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Transcripts were then purified by overnight LiCl precipitation
at −20 °C, pelleted by centrifugation at 14 000
rpm for 20 min, washed once with 70% EtOH, centrifuged at 14 000
rpm for 5 min, and then resuspended in UltraPure H2O. Purified
transcripts were then capped using the ScriptCap m7G Capping System (CellScript, Madison, WI, USA) and ScriptCap 2′-O-Methyltransferase
Kit (CellScript, Madison, WI, USA) simultaneously, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Capped transcripts were then purified
again by LiCl precipitation, resuspended in ultraPure H2O, and stored at −80 °C until use.

Production
of Lipid Nanoparticles
Dimethyldioctadecylammonium
bromide (DDA) (Sigma, U.K.), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane
(DOTAP) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA), and cephalin (soy
phosphatidylethanolamine) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA)
were used as received. C12–200 was synthesized by reacting
1 mol equiv of N1-(2-(4-(2-aminoethyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine
(Enamine Ltd., Kyiv, Ukraine) with 7 mol equiv of 1,2-epoxydodecane
(Sigma, U.K.) at 80 °C for 2.5 days, according to previous protocols.21 LNPs were prepared on a μEncapsulator
1 System (Dolomite Bio, Royston, U.K.). The lipid solution was prepared
by dissolving lipids in 90% EtOH at a total concentration of 1.5 mg/mL,
consisting of 35 mol % complexing lipid (C12–200, cephalin,
DDA, or DOTAP), 49 mol % cholesterol (Sigma, U.K.) and 16 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(DOPE) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA). For high lipid concentration
particles, the total lipid concentration was increased to 7.5 mg/mL.
One hundred microliters (100 μL) of the lipid was loaded into
one side of the μEncapsulator reservoir, while the other side
was loaded with 100 μL of citrate buffer (pH 3), and the solutions
were then loaded into the corresponding pumps. A 50 μm fluorophilic
chip with a T-junction and subsequent PBS dilution channel was used.
LNPs were prepared using the following conditions: chip temperature,
70 °C; lipid solution pump pressure, 2000 Pa; citrate buffer
pump pressure, 666 Pa; and PBS pump pressure, 2000 Pa. LNPs were purified
by dialyzing against PBS in a 3500 MWCO dialysis cartridge (Thermo
Fisher, U.K.) overnight. In these studies, high, medium, and low particle
concentrations correspond to 109, 108, and 107 particles/mL, respectively, diluted in PBS. For combinations
of cationic and zwitterionic lipids, the lipid solutions were prepared
such that the total complexing lipid mole percentage was maintained
at 35 mol % by varying the ratio of DDA/DOTAP to cephalin (10:1,
1:1, or 0.1:1).

Particle Characterization
LNPs were
characterized for
size, particle concentration, and surface charge prior to complexation
with RNA (Figure S1). One hundred microliters
(100 μL) of LNPs was diluted into 900 μL PBS (Sigma, U.K.)
and equilibrated at room temperature prior to analysis. The particle
size and concentration were characterized on a NanoSight LM10 (Malvern
Instruments, U.K.) with NanoSight NTA 3.0 software (Malvern Instruments,
U.K.) using an infusion rate of 20, a capture duration of 1 min, a
gain of 2, and a camera level of 7. Processing parameters were kept
constant for all samples. The surface charge of the LNPs was characterized
on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, U.K.) with Zetasizer
7.1 software (Malvern, U.K.) using 850 μL of diluted particles
in a 1 mL cuvette and the following settings: material refractive
index, 1.529; absorbance, 0.010; dispersant viscosity, 0.8820 cP;
refractive index, 1.330; and dielectric constant, 79. Each sample
was analyzed for up to 100 runs until the measurement stabilized.

Human Skin Explant Injection, Culture, and Imaging
Surgically
resected specimens of human skin tissue were collected
at Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College London, U.K. All tissues
were collected after receiving signed informed consent from all patients,
under protocols approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee. The
tissue was obtained from patients undergoing elective abdominoplasty
or mastectomy surgeries. Tissue was refrigerated until its arrival
in the laboratory, where it was cut into 1 cm2 section,
and the subcutaneous layer of fat removed. Explants were incubated
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Petri dishes with 10 mL of
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 5 mg/mL l-glutamine, and 5 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin
(Thermo Fisher, U.K.). Media was replaced every 3 days, and explants
were cultured for up to 21 days. Explants were injected intradermally
using a Micro-Fine Demi 0.3 mL syringe (Becton Dickinson, U.K.) with
2 μg of RNA and 25 μL of LNPs in PBS, unless otherwise
indicated. After 10 days, explants were inverted such that the epidermis
was submerged in the media, and the media was supplemented with 30
ug/mL XenoLight RediJect D-Luciferin (PerkinElmer, U.K.). Samples
were imaged with a In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) FX Pro (Kodak Co.,
Rochester, NY, USA) equipped with Molecular Imaging Software Version
5.0 (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY, USA), for 60 min. Signal from
each tissue explant was analyzed using Molecular Imaging software
and expressed as total flux (p/s).

Flow Cytometry
For flow cytometry experiments, eGFP
signal was analyzed after 3 days of culture. Skin was minced well
with scissors and incubated in 3 mL DMEM supplemented with 1 mg/mL
collagenase P (Sigma, U.K.) and 5 mg/mL Dispase II (Sigma, U.K.) for
4 h at 37 °C on a rotational shaker. Digests were then filtered
through a 70 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 1750 rpm for
5 min. Cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of FACS buffer (PBS + 2.5%
fetal calf serum (FCS)) at a concentration of 107 cells/mL.
One hundred microliters (100 μL) of cell suspension was added
to a FACS tube and stained with fixable aqua live/dead cell stain
(Thermo Fisher, U.K.) diluted 1:400 in FACS buffer for 20 min on ice.
Cells were then washed with 2.5 mL of FACS buffer, centrifuged at
1750 rpm for 5 min, and stained with a panel of antibodies to identify
each cell type, as described in Table S1 in the Supporting Information, for 30 min. Cells were then washed
with 2.5 mL of FACS buffer, centrifuged at 1750 rpm for 5 min, and
resuspended in 250 μL of PBS. Cells were fixed with 250 μL
of 3% paraformaldehyde for a total final concentration of 1.5% and
refrigerated until flow cytometry analysis. Samples were analyzed
on a LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, U.K.) with FACSDiva software (BD
Biosciences, U.K.) with 30 000 acquired events. Gating strategy
is shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information. GFP positive cells were quantified using FlowJo Version
10 (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).

Design of Experiment and
Statistical Analysis
DoE analysis
was performed in JMP, version 13.0, using a full factorial design
with complexing lipid identity (C12–200, cephalin, DDA, DOTAP),
lipid concentration (high, low), particle concentration (high, low),
and ratio of cationic lipid to zwitterionic lipid (10:1, 1:1, 0.1:1)
as input factors (Table 1), and luciferase expression in human skin explants after 10 days
as the response. The data were analyzed using a fit model of standard
least-squares for effect screening with the model effects designated
as first- and second-order effects only. Nonsignificant effects were
excluded from the model. Graphs were prepared in GraphPad Prism software,
version 7.0. Flow cytometry statistical analysis was performed in
Prism software, using a two-tailed t test with α
= 0.05, which was used to indicate significance.
