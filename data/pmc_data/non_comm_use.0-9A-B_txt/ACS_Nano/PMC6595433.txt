Nanomotors
in nanotechnology are as important as engines in daily
life. Many ATPases are nanoscale biomotors classified into three categories
based on the motion mechanisms in transporting substrates: linear,
rotating, and the recently discovered revolving motion. Most biomotors
adopt a multisubunit ring-shaped structure that hydrolyzes ATP to
generate force. How these biomotors control the motion direction and
regulate the sequential action of their multiple subunits is intriguing.
Many ATPases are hexameric with each monomer containing a conserved
arginine finger. This review focuses on recent findings on how the
arginine finger controls motion direction and coordinates adjacent
subunit interactions in both revolving and rotating biomotors. Mechanisms
of intersubunit interactions and sequential movements of individual
subunits are evidenced by the asymmetrical appearance of one dimer
and four monomers in high-resolution structural complexes. The arginine
finger is situated at the interface of two subunits and extends into
the ATP binding pocket of the downstream subunit. An arginine finger
mutation results in deficiency in ATP binding/hydrolysis, substrate
binding, and transport, highlighting the importance of the arginine
finger in regulating energy transduction and motor function. Additionally,
the roles of channel chirality and channel size are discussed as related
to controlling one-way trafficking and differentiating the revolving
and rotating mechanisms. Finally, the review concludes by discussing
the conformational changes and entropy conversion triggered by ATP
binding/hydrolysis, offering a view different from the traditional
concept of ATP-mediated mechanochemical energy coupling. The elucidation
of the motion mechanism and direction control in ATPases could facilitate
nanomotor fabrication in nanotechnology.

Biomotors, also known as biological
motors, are nanoscale machines ubiquitous in many biological processes,1−3 such as cell mitosis, bacterial binary fission,4,5 DNA
replication,6−8 DNA repair,9−12 homologous recombination,13−15 RNA transcription,16 macromolecule trafficking,17 and viral genome packaging.18−41 Biomotors are essential protein devices that convert an energy source
into different kinds of mechanical motions essential to cellular functions.42 Many of them display a hexameric ring structure.41,43−55 With the recent discovery of a revolving biomotor,56,57 biological motors can be classified into three categories1−3 based on the movement mode of transporting their substrates: linear,
rotating, and revolving.1,5,8,58,59 Specifically, in a rotating motor, the substrate rotates around
its own axis, while in a revolving motor, the substrate revolves around
the second object (Figure 1). The way that revolving motors work is distinct from rotating
motors in that among the multiple parts, only the substrate is circumnavigating.
Rotating refers to the action similar to the Earth turning around
its own axis every 24 h, while revolving is akin to how the Earth
circumnavigates around the Sun every 365 days but without self-rotation.
Revolving rather than rotating avoids the coiling and tangling of
long polymer chains, such as genomic dsDNAs during translocation.
The well-studied rotating motors include F1/F0 ATPase,43−47 DNA helicase,48,49 Rho transcription termination
factor,50−53 TrwB,60−65 MCM,66,67 and RepA or RuvB,68−73 all of which have a channel diameter of 1–2 nm.74 Revolving motors include the DNA translocases
Ftsk in Gram-negative bacteria,54 SpoIIIE
or SftA (YtpS) in Gram-positive bacteria,75 A32 ATPase of poxvirus,76−80 DNA packaging enzyme of adenovirus,81−83 the genome segregation
enzymes of mimivirus,2,84−87 as well as the DNA packaging
motors of herpesvirus,88−103 SPP1,27 T7,104 HK97,105 P22,106 and Phi29.107 The three classes of biomotors
differ in structure and function, but utilize similar mechanisms for
force generation to perform mechanical work. More information about
the linear, rotating, and revolving motors can be found in recent
reviews.1−3

The common feature of
a multisubunit ring-shaped structure of ATPase
motors108,109 has raised an intriguing question on how
these biomotors control the direction of their motion and how the
sequential action of their individual subunits is regulated. The key
driving force in a viral DNA packaging motor is a DNA-dependent ATPase.
Although this was first reported more than 30 years ago,18 literature on mechanisms of directional control
of ATPase motors has just begun to emerge.31,110−115 The common ATP binding domain116,117 contains
highly conserved motifs that form an ATPase activity pocket.117 Previous modeling work on the phi29 gp16 ATPase118 suggested that a conserved arginine residue
plays a critical allosteric role in coordinating the sequential hydrolysis
on the multisubunit ring, as found in both RNA and DNA packaging motors.110,119−124 This arginine residue was defined as the arginine finger. In this
review, we summarize the most recent discoveries on the arginine finger,
focusing on its role in motion direction control, sequential intersubunit
coordination, and asymmetrical multimer assembly. We also discuss
the chirality and size of the DNA transport channel, conformational
changes, and entropy conversion of the motors involved in the revolving
mechanism. Finally, we present a different perception on ATP chemical
energy conversion into physical motion in the hexameric biomotors.
The understanding of motor structure, motion mechanism, and direction
control of oligomeric ATPases will provide a prototype model for future
manufacturing of nanomotors in nanotechnology.110,125,126

Definition and Location
of the Arginine Finger in ATP Regulating
Complexes
Characteristics of ATP-Activity Pocket
The ATP activity
pocket in an ATPase complex typically comprises the following components:
arginine finger, Walker A motif, Walker B motif, P-loop, and lid subdomain
(Figure 2).127 Hexameric ATPases each contain a conserved
core domain, which consists of two conserved sequence motifs termed
Walker A and Walker B45,128,129 with a sequence of GXXGXGKS/T and hhhhDE (Figure 3),18 respectively.
The Walker A and Walker B motifs have been identified to be responsible
for the ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis.18,109,116 Given the conservation of the Walker motifs, it is
not surprising that most residues interacting with ATP are intolerant
of amino acid alterations. The invariant lysines in the Walker A motif
have been intensively studied, revealing their roles in coordinating
the ATP β and γ phosphates and structuring the P-loop
in related NTPases.43,130 Mutation of lysine to a polar
amino acid generally will eliminate the wild-type ATPase function.96 As for the Walker B motif, the conserved negatively
charged residues such as glutamate and aspartate act to polarize a
water molecule to nucleophilically attack the γ phosphate group
of ATP. Most commonly studied mutations are substitutions of glutamate
and aspartate by glutamine or alanine.56,110,125,131,132 Upon these mutations, ATP hydrolysis is prevented, but ATP binding
is retained.

Figure 3 Sequence alignment reveals conserved motifs18,110 (Walker A motif, Walker B motif,116,117 and Arg finger110,125) across different types of ATPases. Highly conserved residues are
highlighted as follows: Orange for Walker A with darkness representing
the rate of homology; red for Walker B; and purple for Arg finger.
The letter h above the column denotes conserved hydrophobic residues.

For some ATPases, the sensor 1
and 2 motifs have also been reported
to play important roles in the ATPase function; however, sensor 1
is not strictly conserved in ATPase proteins, thus whether these two
sensors are common features of all ATPases or just an alternate description
of the arginine finger requires future verification.29,133−138 Sensor 1 motif is located in the loop connecting
the β4 strand to α4 helix. It is often a polar residue
thought to interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP. Due to this
interaction, it is believed that the sensor 1 motif senses the binding
of ATP and orients a water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on the
γ-phosphate of the bound ATP molecule. It has been shown in
p97 D2 that the shift of the sensor 1 residues, upon nucleotide binding,
induces displacements at the distal end of the ATP binding domain.3 Sensor 2, located near the beginning of α7,
is conserved in many ATPase proteins. It contains a conserved arginine
residue, which, together with the Walker B motif, engages the bound
ATP and mediates conformational changes that sequester the catalytic
site from water.33,133 Mutations of the sensor 2 residues
led to a loss or decrease of ATP binding and/or ATP hydrolysis.110,125,135−138

Besides the Walker A, Walker B, and sensors 1 and 2, another
common
component in the ATP-regulating complexes is the lid domain (Figure 2). The lid subdomain
(residues 221–251 in the TerL ATPase) is a short peptide with
negatively charged amino acids that might interact with the positively
charged arginine residues. Crystal structure revealed that the lid
is displayed adjacent to the ATP binding site on the surface of the
ATPase protein.29 Despite its relevance
to ATPase activity, the study on the lid domain has been limited,
probably due to its low degree of conservation among ATPases.

ATP binding and hydrolysis in ATPases are attributed to residues
occupying two or more of the four key sites near the ATP molecule.
These residues are located in the ATP-binding pocket or at the adjacent
intersubunit interface. Among them, arginine possesses an extended
and flexible side chain with a planar and positively charged guanidine
group at its extremity. The positive charge is distributed over the
three side-chain nitrogens, which is advantageous for hydrogen-bond
and electrostatic interactions with groups of opposite charge and
polarity, for example, ATP phosphate groups. The multidentate character
of arginine allows for strong inter- and intraprotein interactions,
as seen in phosphorylation-driven signal transduction pathways.139

Definition and Location of the Arginine Finger
“Arginine
finger” means a particular arginine residue coordinated to
the β- or γ-phosphate of ATP in the ATPase catalytic reaction
center.140 The location of representative
arginine fingers in a certain monomer (Figure 2 left), dimer (Figure 2 right), and hexamer (Figure 4) is illustrated. Although there are multiple
arginine residues present throughout the ATPase protein, the arginine
finger can be identified using knockout experiments.141 For example, an arginine finger knockout study was used
to determine the role and necessity of the arginine finger in F1-ATPase.43 It was found that the substitution of the arginine
residue in the arginine finger motif by a lysine analogue called Lyk
resulted in reduced catalytic function. In another case, the identification
of the arginine finger was achieved via the mutation
of the basic arginine residue to a neutral residue, alanine, in phi29
motor ATPase gp16. Mutated gp16 was found to lose the capability to
incorporate into the hexameric ring, to bind dsDNA, or to package
DNA.110,125

FtsK and the computed gp16 monomers, which represent a single subunit

ATPases are superimposed. (B) Comparison of gp16 and FtsK hexamer

and red spheres, the figure reveals that the arginine finger interacts

The arginine residue is a recurrent characteristic of the
active
sites and subunit interfaces of many ATPase proteins.139 Sequence alignment of different ATPases shows
that the arginine finger motif is conserved across the ATPase families,
but its location varies. Depending on the family it belongs to, the
ATPase protomers can orient differently in the oligomeric assembly,
leading to a different location of the arginine finger. In most ATPase
proteins, the arginine finger contains one or more arginine residues
and is often found at the end of the α4 helix.135 In order to identify the location of the arginine finger
in TerL ATPase, investigators screened mutants of surface-exposed
arginine residues for ATPase activity.29 This experiment identified residue Arg139 as the arginine finger
that interacts with the γ-phosphate of the ATP molecule binding
in the adjacent subunit and helps catalyze ATP hydrolysis. The arginine
finger in the gp16 ATPase was identified to be Arg146, located after
α4, as is the case in other ATPases in the same family with
consensus sequence and confirmed structural information (Figures 2 and 3).110,142 This motif interacts with ATP
in a highly specific fashion, binding to the γ-phosphate of
ATP that is also coordinated by the neighboring subunit. The arginine
finger is essential for ATP hydrolysis, as even conservative mutations
led to the abolition of ATPase activity.143,144

General Function of the Arginine Finger
The conserved
arginine finger plays essential functional roles
in many ATPases.145−156 Positive residues in the active site are necessary for ATP hydrolysis,
which are involved in stabilizing the transition state during the
reaction.157 The arginine finger provides
some of this necessary charge. Substitution mutations that replace
the arginine residue with neutral residues result in the loss of ATPase
function.29,110,125

Although more detailed structural, biophysical, and biochemical
characterization of the arginine finger in motor ATPases is needed,
significant evidence has led to the speculation that the arginine
residue is part of the Walker A and Walker B domains. The characteristic
Walker A and B motifs in ATPases are involved in coordinating the
β and γ phosphates of ATP and a water-activating magnesium
ion during ATP hydrolysis. The ATP hydrolysis is also aided by sensor
1 and 2 motifs. Crystal structures of the biomotor ATPase domains
reveal a highly conserved arginine residue in the proximity of the
sensor 2 motif (Figure 2). In these structures, an ATP molecule comes into contact with the
Walker A and B motifs of one subunit, while the arginine finger coordinates
the ATP from the adjacent subunit (Figure 4).158

Perception on trans Action but Not cis Action of the
Arginine Fingers in ATPases or Motor Complexes
It is believed
that the arginine finger facilitates the ATP hydrolysis
in a trans manner.159 The
term trans originates from the Latin root “trans” meaning “across from”, which
is relative to “cis”, meaning “the
same side as”. Specifically, a trans-acting
arginine finger refers to an arginine residue from one ATPase subunit
that regulates the ATP hydrolysis in the adjacent subunit. A cis-acting arginine finger, on the other hand, refers to
an arginine residue that regulates the ATP hydrolysis in the same
subunit. The classification of the trans-acting arginine
finger is important for both understanding the ATPase mechanism and
defining the structure of the active ring assembly.29 To investigate this, the crystal structures of the ATPase
activity domains of biomotors have been employed for comparison and
analysis. The overall structural features of the core domains are
conserved in all ATPases of the superfamily with a conserved arginine
residue near the sensor 2 motif; however, the helicase superfamily
III proteins lack the sensor 2 arginine due to an atypically formed
α-helical domain. A majority of ATPases are arranged in such
a way that the nucleotide binding pocket is positioned at the interface
between two protomers.110,160 This structural arrangement
supports the notion that, in an active ATPase complex, the arginine
finger of one subunit should be positioned near the nucleotide bound
in the neighboring subunit. A structure of the hexameric ring of phi29
gp16 ATPase was modeled by aligning with the hexameric FtsK DNA translocase
of Escherichia coli.110 The arginine finger of one subunit was shown to outstretch to the
active site of the adjacent subunit, in agreement with other ATPases,
such as TerL and ClpX, in which the arginine finger is positioned
in the ATP binding pocket for cooperative behavior among subunits.29,161 This structural feature is evident in various ATPase hexamers (Figure 2). Mutants that showed
no ATPase activity were tested to determine if proper function could
be restored by adding ATPase monomers with an intact arginine finger.
Biochemical complementation assays thus revealed that the mutant whose
arginine is disabled in cis (within the same subunit)
does not restore activity, but that disabled in trans (not in the same subunit) does restore activity.

Nonetheless,
the literature on the arginine finger is still inconsistent.
Some reports suggest that the arginine finger is a cis-acting component that functions within a single subunit of the ATPase
ring,43 while
others report that the arginine finger is a trans-acting factor that bridges two adjacent subunits.29,110,125,159,162−164 Some studies even suggest that there are two arginine fingers in
each ATPase subunit.109,139 It has also been reported that
the reduction in ATPase activity upon arginine finger mutation is
due to an effect on catalysis but not ATP binding.143 The complexity and the controversy may be due to the fact
that some ATPases are a circular-shaped, multiple component ring,47,165−169 but some ATPases are present as a single subunit.170,171

Comparison of the Arginine Fingers Across Various ATPase Types
Arginine fingers are mostly conserved in ATPase proteins (Figure 3). Oligomeric ATPases
contain one arginine finger per monomer subunit. It has been shown
that ATPases from SF1 and SF2 contain a tandem fold and bind the nucleotide
at the interface between two domains. Similar to many ATPases,172,173 the N-terminal provides the Walker A and Walker B motifs, and the
C-terminal provides other elements, some of which are for binding
of the substrate, such as dsDNA. Mutations of these arginine residues
are lethal and lead to loss of in vivo and/or in vitro activity, suggesting that these residues are imperative
in ATP metabolism.110,139,159,162,174

Although the arginine finger is, in general, involved in the
proper
functioning of ATPases, its function may vary slightly across different
ATPase types. The arginine residue is able to interact with the γ-phosphate
of ATP and is required for ATP binding, hydrolysis, and intersubunit
communication. It is positioned near the γ-phosphate of ATP
and plays a catalytic role in properly positioning the ATP molecule
within the ATP binding site.175 It is believed
that the arginine finger may also play a role in stabilizing the transition
state during hydrolysis.176 Mutational
studies concluded that the main role of the arginine finger in the
F1-ATPase is to catalyze ATP hydrolysis and mediate efficient energy
conversion.43,44 Mutations of Walker A and arginine
finger yield a similar phenotype, indicating that the arginine finger
is also involved in nucleotide binding.110,159

Additionally, the arginine finger may also aid in stabilizing
the
ATPase hexamers135 due to its role in dimer
formation and intersubunit interaction.110,125,177 Arginine finger mutations178 in HslU, p97 VCP, ClpB D1, ClpC D1, and Hsp104
D1 prevent oligomer formation even in the presence of ATP, supporting
the proposal that the arginine finger is involved in formation of
a dimer in the hexameric ring.110 Nevertheless,
arginine finger mutations have led to different results from those
in Ras/RasGAP proteins, where complex formation was not affected upon
arginine subsititution. This mystery suggests that the identification
of the arginine finger in Ras/RasGAP requires rescrutiny.

Another
ATPase, which differs in its role in the cell but contains
similar structural motifs and ATP hydrolysis mechanisms, is RuvB ATPase.137 RuvB and motor ATPases are both hexameric proteins.
In E. coli, the cross-shaped Ruv family proteins
function in genetic recombination through processing Holliday junctions.
RuvB contains an arginine residue (Arg174) that is located between
sensor 1 and 2 motifs. Mutagenesis experiments reveal that this arginine
residue is essential for ATP hydrolysis and proper ATPase function.70−73 The arginine finger in RuvB is also responsible for intersubunit
interaction during the ATP hydrolytic cycle, similar to that of the
arginine finger in the phi29 biomotor.

An Asymmetric ATPase Hexamer
Made Up of One “Dimer”
and Four Monomers
In many hexameric ring-shaped ATPases,
the arginine finger serves
as the bridge between two of the ATPase subunits; the two adjacent
subunits thus form a more compact dimer configuration that may appear
as a monomer in low-resolution cryo-EM images. This caused the hexameric
ring to appear asymmetrical, as shown for the phi29 motor ATPase by
the Guo group.56,57 This asymmetric hexameric structure
has been observed in X-ray diffraction and cryo-EM imaging of many
ATPases in addition to the phi29 motor ATPase gp16 (Figure 5).110,179−187 This hypothesis of one interchanging dimer and four monomers is
supported by the profile of gp16 in ultracentrifugation, showing the
presence of both monomers and dimers in the mixture. However, ATPase
motors have for a long time been reported as a pentameric configuration
by cryo-EM, probably due to the interchanging dimers that display
close contact between two adjacent ATPase subunits. Traditional cryo-EM
is an ensemble measurement by averaging over many configurations,
thus the dimer with close contact might show as one instead of two
subunits. Moreover, the low and featureless EM density maps of gp16
in recent cryo-EM imaging of the entire motor complex115 have precluded the possibility of obtaining
an unambiguous fit for five or six copies of gp16, adding another
layer of ambiguity to the ongoing debate.

Each subunit of the ATPase hexamer
has the capability of binding
an ATP molecule; however, saturation of the ATPase with ATP reveals
that at least two of the subunits are not bound with ATP. Even when
not all subunits are able to bind ATP, the ATPase function is retained.188 These observations
suggest that the functional ATPase hexamer is asymmetrical and the
subunits in the ATPase vary in conformation during ATP hydrolysis.
To investigate the role of the arginine finger in the dimer formation
within the hexameric ATPases, arginine knockout experiments were performed.
It was found that mutation of the arginine finger in phi29 gp16 resulted
in loss of dimer assembly and DNA packaging ability; however, dimer
formation was rescued with the addition of either a wild-type gp16,
a Walker A mutant, or a Walker B mutant, which all contain a functional
arginine finger. An inhibition assay in which the arginine finger
function is knocked out revealed that a single arginine mutant subunit
led to inactivation of the entire ATPase ring. These results suggest
that the arginine finger is a necessary component for coordinating
the formation of the ATP binding pocket and intersubunit communication
in the revolving motor ATPases.110,139

Further
evidence that the arginine finger motif drives the formation
of dimers is provided by glycerol gradient centrifugation and electromobility
shift assays (EMSA) experiments, where both monomeric and dimeric
subunits are present in the ATPase population.110,125 In order to determine the ratio of monomer to dimer during DNA packaging,
investigators tested the packaging activity of the different fractions
recovered from the sucrose gradient. It was observed that the fraction
containing the dimer alone did not have DNA packaging activity, while
DNA packaging activity was retained in the fractions that also contained
monomers. This finding is also supported by a previous report that
the addition of fresh gp16 monomer and ATP is necessary for re-initiating
the activity of DNA packaging intermediates, which contained gp16
dimers, into an infection virus.189

Outstretching
to Adjacent ATP Pockets and Formation of Dimeric
Subcomplexes To Regulate Sequential Action of ATPases
Recently,
the way the arginine finger regulates the motion direction
of the ATPase within the phi29 DNA packaging motor has been proposed.110 The model assumes that ATP/DNA binding and
ATP hydrolysis are coupled with conformational changes of the gp16
ATPase. These changes occur in a sequential manner and are coordinated
by the arginine finger. The arginine finger acts as a bridge between
two adjacent subunits, leading to the formation of a transient dimer.
The conformational changes of the ATPase subunit will in turn lead
to the displacement of the dsDNA to the adjacent monomer. During this
process, the formation of the dimer results in an asymmetric hexamer,
which explains why many previous studies showed asymmetric structures
of various ATPase hexamer models (Figure 5).110,179−187 The arginine finger functions in intersubunit interaction by extending
from one subunit to the adjacent one, which facilitates the formation
of a dimer.

The demonstration of a sequential mechanism raises
the question
of how the different subunits of the ATPase can sense the ATP/DNA
binding state of the adjacent subunits. Investigators addressed this
question by studying the behavior of gp16 mutants in which the arginine
fingers were mutated. Mutated gp16 eliminated its capability to assemble
into dimers, and the mutant was unable to hydrolyze ATP, bind DNA,
or package DNA in an ATP-dependent manner.110,125 Thus, the arginine finger was implicated to regulate conformational
changes, dimer formation, DNA binding, and ATP hydrolysis and thus
eventually to orchestrate force generation for DNA translocation in
the phi29 motor.110,125,190,191 This finding was further confirmed
recently, reported as a switch-like regulator.192

In the sequential mechanism of gp16 action (Figure 6), it was proposed
that the hydrolysis of
ATP causes a conformational change to the ATPase subunit, which destabilizes
the “active” ATPase dimer and may simultaneously trigger
a conformational change (strike) of the arginine finger. This outstretch
of the arginine finger to the adjacent ATP binding pocket facilitates
the formation of the next in-line “active” dimer. Mutagenesis
studies were conducted with phi29 ATPase, HslU, p97 VCP, and others
in which both ATP hydrolysis and oligomer formation were impaired
due to mutation of the arginine finger. This leads to the conclusion
that these arginine fingers function in motor subunit communication
as well as ATP hydrolysis.109,110,125,138 The mutation of the arginine
finger in gp16 led to impaired function in DNA binding in the presence
of γ-S-ATP. Hence, the arginine finger appears to regulate the
sequential action of the gp16 ATPases by carrying the ATP/DNA binding/hydrolysis
information from one subunit to another, adding an extra level of
cooperativity in gp16 as seen in other mutants, such as in Walker
B mutations.56,57,110

Interestingly, it was reported
that hydrophobic residues in the
catalytic site of an ATPase may play a role in controlling the motor
speed.193 These hydrophobic residues are
thought to be responsible for controlling the number of water molecules
within the catalytic space and altering the network of water interactions.
Natural evolution has selected the optimal speed variants that ultimately
improve the fitness of organisms or phages, which may be the reason
why these hydrophobic residues are considered nonconserved motifs.

Entropy-Driven
Prohead- and DNA-Dependent Conformational Changes
of ATPases To Trigger ATP Hydrolysis and Motion in Relevance to Allosteric
Effects of the Arginine Finger
Besides providing necessary
positive charges for ATP binding and
hydrolysis, the arginine finger plays an indispensable role in regulating
the conformational changes and coordinating the sequential motions
in the ATPase complexes.194,195 In 1986, Guo et al. reported18 that viral
DNA packaging enzymes, including gp16 of phi29, gp19 of T7, gp17 of
T4 and gpA of λ, all contain a conserved A-type sequence of
“basic-hydrophobic region-G-X2-G-X-G-K-S-X7-hydrophobic”
(X represents any amino acid) for ATP binding. After the construction
of the first defined in vitro DNA packaging system
with all purified components40 and the
discovery of the pRNA as the motor-gearing component,38 they were able to elucidate that the two enzymes involved
in DNA packaging have distinct functions; the enzyme with larger molecular
weight is a prohead and DNA-dependent ATPase, while the other with
smaller molecular weight is responsible for DNA binding. In the same
paper, it was reported that the gp16 of bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging
motor is a prohead and DNA-dependent ATPase.18 The mechanism of “prohead and DNA-dependent ATPase”
has been scrutinized for 30 years and is now clear. It suggests that
the interaction of the gp16 ATPase with other motor components leads
to a change in conformation (entropy) of the ATPase subunit, resulting
in a higher affinity for dsDNA. The subsequent DNA binding leads to
a second conformational change of the ATPase subunit that is activated
to hydrolyze the bound ATP. Hydrolysis of ATP leads to another conformational
change of the ATPase (higher entropy) that resumes a low affinity
for dsDNA, thus pushing the DNA to the adjacent ATP-bound subunit
of a high affinity for dsDNA. Such alternative high and low affinities
for DNA are the forces that drive the motion of the dsDNA substrate
in the DNA packaging motor.

In the ATPase catalytic cycle, ATP
binding causes the first round
of conformational (entropy) changes of the ATPase subunits, a positive
allosteric effect that results in a higher affinity for dsDNA. The
interaction of ATP and ATPase has been studied using a variety of
assays. EMSA demonstrated that nonhydrolyzable γ-S-ATP qualitatively
stalls and fastens the formation of ATPase/dsDNA complex, indicating
that ATPase undergoes conformational (entropy) changes upon ATP binding
and leads to a higher affinity for dsDNA.56,57,110 Similar results were observed from Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, showing increased energy
transfer from eGFP-ATPase to Cy3-dsDNA upon addition of γ-S-ATP.56 Sedimentation studies also revealed a high prevalence
of the gp16-dsDNA complex with γ-S-ATP. As expected, such conformational
changes are abolished by the site-directed mutation of the Walker
A motif,165 which has been identified18 and confirmed18,56,172 to be responsible for ATP binding.133

ATP is hydrolyzed only after dsDNA binding, which
then causes a
conformational (entropy) setback of the ATPase subunit, a negative
allosteric effect on the ATPase subunit that leads to a lower affinity
toward dsDNA, pushing the dsDNA toward the next adjacent ATPase subunit
that has already bound with an ATP. The dsDNA advances by dsDNA by
0.54 nm or 0.27 nm for each of the 12 steps in the connector channel.
That is, each ATP molecule packages 1.75 bp of dsDNA. The process
repeats six times as the DNA moves by a helical pitch, that is six
ATP molecules are consumed for one DNA revolving cycle, corresponding
to the packaging of 10.6 bp.56 The translocation
from one subunit to another subunit is regulated by the action of
the arginine finger. The hydrolysis of ATP was confirmed by adding
ATP to the purified ATPase/dsDNA/γ-S-ATP complex. ATP replaced
the γ-S-ATP, leading to the release of dsDNA from the complex.
ADP had a lesser effect on dsDNA release, whereas AMP was incapable
of releasing dsDNA from ATPase.56 The release
of inorganic phosphate from the P-loop stimulates an entropy gain
in ATPase, which is accompanied by a conformational shift that forces
the substrate DNA away from the interior pocket of the ATPase, resulting
in the movement of the genomic DNA toward the next ATPase subunit.
Given that Walker B mutants bind ATP but do not hydrolyze ATP,165 introduction of a mutation to the Walker B
motif eliminates the catalytic step and thus halts DNA translocation.

The
Left- and Right-Handed Chirality between the Revolving and
Rotating Motors Offers Additional Direction Control Coupled with the
Arginine Finger
Sequential action of the arginine finger
is critical for controlling
the motion direction in the phi29 DNA package motor; however, an additional
component, the 12-subunit connector, also plays a significant role
in controlling the motion direction. For example, the chirality is
the way to ensure “the push through a one-way valve”.193,196 Revolving motors show left-handed chirality, which is distinct from
the right-handed chirality of rotating motors. Genomic dsDNA generally
is B-type right-handed. The revolving of the dsDNA along the channel
wall without self-rotating requires the surrounding track to have
an opposite chirality to match contours of the DNA and the channel
(Figure 8).1,74 Hence, the left-handed channel wall is a necessary factor for a
revolving motor, as it facilitates the threading motion of one strand
of the dsDNA. This antichiral arrangement between the DNA helix and
the channel is also seen in SPP1, T7, HK97, and P22 motors.27,104−107 The connector channels in these motors are made up of 12 subunits
that are oriented in a 30° tilt, leading to the opposite chiral
arrangement to reach a configuration match during DNA translocation.
Since the phage genome moves along the channel wall via only one strand in the 5′-3′ direction, as seen in
Phi29,2,37 the 30° tilt to the left ensures the
continuous engagement and contact of this strand when the DNA shifts
to the next subunit of the dodecamer. Three hundred sixty degrees
in one turn during the 12-step motion results in 30° per step
(360°/12 = 30°) (Figure 7).1,74 This configuration avoids coiling
and torsional forces as seen in rotating motors. Taken together, the
left-handed antichiral arrangement of the motor channels of the revolving
motor leads to a controlled threading motion of the substrate, supporting
a revolving motor model (Figure 8 bottom).74

Although bacteriophage
portal proteins from various families do
not show significant sequence alignment nor similar size, they assemble
to a similar overall structure. For example, bacteriophage Phi29,
SPP1, and T7104 have protein sizes of 36
kDa (Phi29 gp10),107 57 kDa (SPP1 gp6),27 and 59 kDa (T7 gp8),104 respectively. Bacteriophage P22 has a protein component, gp1, which
is 94 kDa.106 These portal proteins are
all arranged in a propeller-like, 12-subunit structure with a central
channel acting as a valve for DNA translocation. In addition to sharing
similar three-dimensional structures, these bacteriophage motor proteins
have analogous conserved regions that function in viral genome packaging.
In nearly all portal proteins, the sequence stretch of α-β-α-β-β-α
exists with a similar pattern of strands and helices and with similar
spacing and length.

Analysis of the quaternary structures of
various bacteriophages
has revealed that the 30° tilted helix exists in all portal proteins.
Evidence that the antichiral arrangement is integral in dsDNA packaging
is seen in mapping studies, revealing that the 30° tilt occurs
in the same conserved sequences in the last α helix of the α-β-α-β-β-α
stretch. This highlights the importance of this 30° antichiral
arrangement, as it has been conserved by evolution.1 According to a parallel threading mechanism of bolt and
nut,1,74 rotating motors need to have right-handed
channels in order to accommodate right-handed dsDNAs (Figure 8, top). Verification of the
right-handed rotating motor is provided by crystal structures of helicase-DNA
complexes that have a right-handed spiral configuration.48 This is seen in RecA filament and DnaB, which
function in a nonplanar hexameric conformation.48 In this rotating-like mechanism, for example, RecA monomers
assemble into an open washer shape in a concatemeric arrangement.197 ATPases, however, remain as a symmetrical closed
ring in the absence of dsDNA.110 E1 helicase
also adopts a right-handed staircase conformation when bound with
dsDNA.198 Crystallographic studies provide
evidence that right-handed motor complexes use the rotating mechanism.197

Figure 8 Different chiralities of rotating and revolving motors.
Rotating
biomotors exhibit right-handed chirality to drive the right-handed
dsDNA similar to the nut driving the bolt or the screw driver turning
the screw, whereas revolving biomotors exhibit left-handed chirality
within the channel. Crystal structure analysis of viral DNA packaging
motors reveals that this class of biomotors package DNA using the

The mechanism for the packaging
of viral double-stranded genome
into the protein shell with the aid of an elegant motor is an intriguing
subject.1−3,20,199−204 Significant progress on the study of the mechanisms of viral DNA
packaging motors has been achieved in the poxvirus,76−80 adenovirus,81−83 herpesvirus,88−103 and minivirus.2,84−87 Studies have revealed that the
revolving mechanism is a common feature shared by all the dsDNA packaging
motors, including SPP1, P22, T7, the HK97 family phage, and poxvirus
evidenced by the results from both structural and biochemical studies.
Analysis of crystal structures of the motor channels (the connectors)
of SPP1,27 T7,104 HK97,105 P22,106 and Phi29107 revealed that all of the
motor channels displayed an antichiral arrangement between the channel
and the DNA helices. The primary amino acid sequences are not conserved;
however, the 3D structures of the swivels are both conserved and aligned.1,74 Structural analysis of the SPP1 and Phi29 channels reveals unidirectional
flow loops that function in the one-way trafficking of dsDNA. Layers
of positively charged lysine residues,193 representative of all phage channels, interact with the electronegative
phosphate backbone of a single DNA strand. The effectiveness of the
viral DNA packaging motor is due in part to the coordination of these
complementary forces.

Revolving ATPase motors move along one
strand of the dsDNA in the
5′ → 3′ direction.3,37,74,110,205 RecA ATPases also move along in the 5′ → 3′
direction. Unlike the revolving motors and RecA ATPases, some rotating
ATPases move in the 3′ → 5′ direction.206 Whether the DNA strand polarity is relevant
to the revolving or rotating mechanism remains to be elucidated.

Revolving
and Rotating Motors Can Be Distinguished by Their
Channel Size
The arginine finger is critical for controlling
the motion direction;
however, how could the similar arginine finger control the two kinds
of motors (rotating and revolving) that are very different in motion
mechanism? The two differential motion mechanisms are also dictated
by an additional motor structure factor: the channel size, which can
be used to distinguish revolving motors from rotating ones. Channel
size also plays an important role in controlling the one way motion
and the motion direction. For rotating motors, their channel diameter
should be no larger than 2 nm (the diameter of a dsDNA) to allow for
close contact between a DNA and the channel wall for threading, since
a ssDNA within the channel displays an A form helical structure and
is smaller than 2 nm in diameter.48 Examples
include rotating motors of DnaB,48 Rho
factor,50−52 TrwB,60−65 MCM,66 and RepA or RuvB,68−73 all of which have a channel diameter of 1–2 nm.74

For revolving motors, such as a Phi29
DNA packaging motor, their
channel diameter is generally larger than 3 nm. The larger channel
size of the revolving motors allows a dsDNA to revolve around the
channel wall, while precluding the possibility of a bolt and nut tracing
mechanism, characteristic of rotating motors. Cryo-EM images of a
tilted T7 dsDNA core relative to its axis reveal that in revolving
motors, dsDNA advances by touching the channel wall rather than passing
through the center of the channel.207,208

The
difference in channel size has been confirmed by crystal structure
analysis, cryo-EM measurement, and single-channel conductance assays.
The diameter of dsDNA is 2 nm, while the diameters of the narrowest
region of the connector channels of Phi29,107 SPP1,27 HK97,105 the ATPase ring of T4,33,205 as well as the dsDNA
translocase FtsK54 of bacteria, are all
larger than 3 nm (Figure 9). To prove the revolving mechanism, the connector of bacteriophage
Phi29 DNA packaging motor was used as the channel for the single pore
translocation of folded, double-stranded, or tetra-stranded DNA. A
current blockage of 32% was observed for translocation of dsDNA through
the connector channel,209 consistent with
the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of dsDNA; A = πr2, dsDNA ((2/2)2 × 3.14 = 3.14 nm2), and channel ((3.6/2)2 × 3.14 = 10.2 nm2, 10.2 nm2/3.14 nm2 = 32%). While for tetra-stranded DNA, passage through the
connector channel of Phi29 yields a blockage of ∼64%. This
blockage data show that the cross-sectional area at the narrowest
region of the Phi29 funnel is 3-fold the area of the dsDNA. The much
larger width of the nut, in comparison to the bolt, precludes the
possibility of a bolt and nut threading mechanism, but rather suggests
that, at any translocation step, the dsDNA can be in contact with
only one (or two) ATPase subunit.74

In contrast, the channels of rotating motors, such as replicative
DNA helicases TrwB, E1, and DnaB,48,64,167,210−212 are smaller than 2 nm in diameter (Figure 9). For these motors, the channel is expected
to have a width similar to that of ssDNA. Nonetheless, for certain
rotating motors, local unwinding fluctuations of the dsDNA lead to
separation of the double helix, and thus only one strand enters the
channel, while the other remains outside.168,213−218 Given that the ssDNA within the channel displays an A form helical
structure,48 the channel diameter should
be no larger than 2 nm so that the ssDNA can make full contact with
the channel. Overall, the above data indicate that the revolving motor
can be distinguished from the rotating motor by the size of their
motor channels.

Figure 9 Channel size to differentiate rotating and revolving mechanism.
Rotating motors have channel sizes all ≤2.0 nm in diameter
to ensure full contact between DNA and channel wall similar to the
nut driving the bolt, while revolving motors have channel sizes ≥3
nm to have room to accommodate the revolving motion. Reprinted in

Conclusion
The arginine finger is an indispensable part
of the ATP-activity
pocket of the ring-shaped ATPase motors with revolving or rotating
mechanisms. It is believed to be involved in initiating and coordinating
the sequential action within the motor, which eventually leads to
the pulling and pushing motions of the substrate during translocation.
The arginine finger is also implicated to play a role in controlling
the motion direction of the motor. All of these are achieved through
a trans-action mechanism in promoting dimer formation,
direct involvement in regulating ATP binding and hydrolysis, and allosteric
effects associated with protein conformational changes.
