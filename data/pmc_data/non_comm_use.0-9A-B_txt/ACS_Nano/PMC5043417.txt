Protein engineering has been used
to remodel pores for applications
in biotechnology. For example, the heptameric α-hemolysin pore
(αHL) has been engineered to form a nanoreactor to study covalent
chemistry at the single-molecule level. Previous work has been confined
largely to the chemistry of cysteine side chains or, in one instance,
to an irreversible reaction of an unnatural amino acid side chain
bearing a terminal alkyne. Here, we present four different αHL
pores obtained by coupling either two or three fragments by native
chemical ligation (NCL). The synthetic αHL monomers were folded
and incorporated into heptameric pores. The functionality of the pores
was validated by hemolysis assays and by single-channel current recording.
By using NCL to introduce a ketone amino acid, the nanoreactor approach
was extended to an investigation of reversible covalent chemistry
on an unnatural side chain at the single-molecule level.

==== Body
α-Hemolysin (αHL) is a pore-forming
toxin secreted
by Staphylococcus aureus. The pore
contains seven subunits, and each subunit comprises 293 amino acids.1 Use of the heptameric αHL protein pore
as a nanoreactor has proved profitable in studies of covalent chemistry
at the single-molecule level.2−5 For example, the nanoreactor approach is advantageous
because large, potentially interfering, fluorescent probes are not
required. When a molecule undergoes a chemical reaction on the inner
wall of the transmembrane β barrel of the αHL pore, the
current carried by ions flowing through the pore is perturbed. Hence,
individual reaction steps, including those that are not rate-limiting
and therefore not detectable at the ensemble level, are visualized
in the microsecond time domain, and the kinetics of each step can
be determined.2−5 Recently, complex reaction networks4 and
the motion of individual molecular walkers5 have been examined by this means. However, the chemistry carried
out within engineered αHL nanoreactors has until recently been
confined to the reactions of thiolates2−8 and derivatives of the side chains of cysteine residues.9,10 Lately, we expanded the range of chemistry that can be approached
by introducing unnatural amino acid side chains into the αHL
polypeptide by using native chemical ligation (NCL).11 By this means, an irreversible reaction of a side chain
bearing a terminal alkyne was examined. In the present work, we advance
the unnatural amino acid approach by introducing a ketone side chain
which allows for observation of reversible chemistry. We also describe
truncated pores made by the NCL approach.

Results
General Approach
to Two-Fragment Ligation
Two-fragment
ligations involved the reaction of an N-terminal fragment (NTF) containing
a C-terminal αthioester with a C-terminal fragment
(CTF) bearing an N-terminal cysteine (N-Cys). The NTF coding sequence
was fused in-frame with DNA encoding a Mycobacterium
xenopi DNA gyrase A (Mxe GyrA) intein–chitin
binding domain (CBD), that is, NTF–intein–CBD, in the
pTXB3 plasmid (New England Biolabs).12 After
expression of the protein in Escherichia coli, the NTF-αthioester was cleaved from the intein–CBD
with sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNa), while the rest
of the chimera remained bound to chitin beads.13,14 A CTF with an N-Cys can be generated by cleavage of a precursor
fusion protein with a site-specific protease.15,16 However, this method may not work efficiently with proteins of poor
solubility or proteins from inclusion bodies. In the latter case,
the protease can be inactivated by denaturants used to solubilize
a target protein, and even if cleavage is successful, an additional
purification step may be required to separate the product from the
protease and unwanted fragments. An alternative approach to generate
N-Cys, which was taken here, is to express the polypeptide initiated
by fMet-Cys. Following expression, formylmethionine (fMet) is removed
by endogenous deformylation and methionine aminopeptidase activity,
and the N-Cys residue undergoes condensation with pyruvic acid, an
abundant metabolite, to form a thiazolidine.17 This strategy is protease-free and allows rapid overexpression of
the target polypeptide (4 h) at 37 °C. The polypeptide accumulated
in inclusion bodies is subsequently purified under denaturing conditions
(8 M urea or 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gu·HCl)), and the N-Cys
is unmasked with hydroxylamine or a hydroxylamine derivative.18 The use of denaturants enables the purification
of polypeptides containing transmembrane regions, which are often
insoluble and obtained in very low yields when processed under nondenaturing
conditions (unpublished work).

Preparation of Polypeptides
for Two-Fragment Ligation
We targeted three αHL polypeptides
for semisynthesis by two-fragment
coupling (Figure 1A):
a full-length αHL monomer and two different truncated barrel
mutants (TBMΔ6) (Figure S1A–C). TBMΔ6 forms an αHL heptamer in which amino acids have
been removed in pairwise fashion from both of the two β strands
contributed by each subunit, resulting in a β barrel shortened
by 6 amino acids.19 TBMΔ6 forms conductive
pores despite the short length of the barrel, presumably by inducing
the formation of toroidal lipid pores that span the bilayer.19 Two TBMΔ6s bearing a different amino acid
at residue 113 (Met, Phe) were chosen, as it has been shown that the
mutation Met-113→Phe significantly alters the binding kinetics
of cyclodextrin adaptors to the pore.20

by native chemical ligation from two fragments (NTF and CTF) expressed
in E. coli. Folding was performed by
reducing the concentration of the denaturant (8 M urea) present during
the purification of the synthetic monomers (SM). (B–D) Characterization
of the synthetic αHL monomers by LC-MS. (B) SMf:

(obs), 33 923 (calcd). (E) Hemolysis assays (see Supporting Information, Experimental procedures).
The decrease in light scattering over time was recorded in a microplate
reader at 595 nm. WT αHL monomer (row 1) lysed rRBCs, whereas
TBMΔ6 (row 3) did not due to its truncated β barrel. Similarly,
the full-length synthetic αHL monomer SMf (5.9 μg
mL–1, in well 1) lysed rRBCs, whereas SMΔ6–113M (7.4 μg mL–1) and SMΔ6–113F (7.8 μg mL–1) did not. WT and TBMΔ6
monomers were produced by IVTT. (F) SDS-PAGE gel analysis of WT and
synthetic αHL (SMf). Lane 1: molecular markers. Lane

Blue-stained gel. (G) Heteroheptameric pores. WT αHL (radiolabeled
protein) and SM were mixed in various ratios in the presence of rRBCm
to yield heteromeric WT7–nSMn (n = 0–7) pores.
The heptameric pores with different numbers of SMf were
separated by SDS-PAGE based on the different electrophoretic mobilities
produced by D8 tails at the C-terminus of SMf. (H) Homoheptameric pores formed with SMΔ6–113M (left) and SMΔ6–113F (right). Homomeric
pores were prepared in the presence of DPhPC liposomes (10 mg mL–1).

Three different NTFs
(NTF126 [Ala1-Gly126], NTF113M [Ala1-Met113], and NTF113F [Ala1-Phe113]) each
bearing an αthioester at the C-terminus were obtained
by thiolysis of the corresponding intein–CBD fusion proteins
after expression in E. coli. The pTXB3–NTF126 and pTXB3–NTF113M plasmids were prepared
by cloning PCR-amplified DNA, encoding residues 1–126 and 1–113
of αHL, upstream of the intein–CBD codons (Figure S2A,B). pTXB3–NTF113F was prepared by mutagenesis of pTXB3–NTF113M by
homologous recombination (Figure S2C).21 Fusion proteins were produced in E. coli (BL21(DE3), NEB) and solubilized from inclusion
bodies under denaturing conditions (8 M urea). The NTF-αthioesters were obtained by on-column thiolysis of the fusion proteins
bound to chitin columns with MESNa (Figure S3). The purified NTF-αthioesters were characterized
by LC-MS (Figure S4, NTF126:
[M + H]+ = 14 150 (obs), 14 150 Da (calcd);
NTF113M: [M + H]+ = 12 838 (obs), 12 838
Da (calcd); NTF113F: [M + H]+ = 12 853
(obs), 12 854 Da (calcd)).

The pT7-SC1-CTF127 plasmid was prepared by replacing
plasmid DNA encoding residues 1–127 with the codons for Met-Cys
as previously reported.11 To produce CTFΔ114, pT7-SC1-CTFΔ114-DH was prepared
by two successive homologous recombinations21 from pT7-TBMΔ6, which encodes TBMΔ6 (Figure S5). The codons for residues 1–113 were removed
(retaining the initiator Met), and codons for a D8H6 (DH) tag were added in the first and second rounds, respectively.
The two different C-terminal fragments (CTF127 [Cys127-Asn293]-D8H6, and CTFΔ114 [Cys114-Asn293, ΔPhe120-Thr125, ΔGly133-Ala138]-D8H6) were overexpressed
in E. coli. Like the NTFs, the CTFs
were obtained from inclusion bodies and, in this case, purified under
denaturing conditions (6 M Gu·HCl) by FPLC (ÄKTA purifier, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at room temperature by use
of the His6 tag at the C-terminus (Figure S6). The N-terminal fMet was found to be absent, and
the thiazolidine produced by condensation of the N-Cys with pyruvic
acid was removed with 0.4 M HONH2·HCl for 4 h at room
temperature. The purified CTFs were characterized by LC-MS (Figure S7, CTF127: [M + H]+ = 20 974 (obs), 20 974 Da (calcd); CTFΔ114: [M + H]+ = 21 214 (obs), 21 212 Da (calcd)).

α-Hemolysin Polypeptides by Two-Fragment Ligation
We ligated NTFs and CTFs (Figure S1) in
NCL buffer [200 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.9), 6 M Gu·HCl,
200 mM 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA), and 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP)] to make three different αHL constructs. In each case,
an NTF and a CTF were mixed and the buffer was exchanged by dilution–concentration
cycles with a centrifugal filter. NTF126 (∼0.5 mM)
and CTF127 (∼0.5 mM) were coupled to produce the
full-length αHL synthetic monomer (SMf). NTF113M (∼0.6 mM) and NTF113F (∼0.7 mM)
were separately coupled with CTFΔ114 (∼0.8
mM) to yield two different truncated mutant monomers19 (SMΔ6–113M and SMΔ6–113F). The rate of ligation is highly dependent on the steric properties
of the C-terminal amino acid residue of an NTF22,23 and the concentration of reactants. The ligation reactions were
carried out for >12 h at a final concentration of ∼1 mM
as
previous work22 had suggested that ligations
of NTFs containing C-terminal Ala, Val, Ile, Met, and Phe are completed
within 9 h at a final peptide concentration of 1–3 mM. The
two-fragment couplings gave SMf, SMΔ6–113M, and SMΔ6–113F (Figures S8 and S9) in 48, 46, and 50% yields, respectively.

Purification,
Folding, and Functional Properties of α-Hemolysin
Polypeptides
We purified the SMs (SMf, SMΔ6–113M, and SMΔ6–113F) by gel filtration in 8 M urea (Figure S8) and characterized them by LC-MS (Figure 1B–D and Figure S8, SMf: [M + H]+ = 34 983 (obs),
34 981 Da (calcd); SMΔ6–113M: [M +
H]+ = 33 908 (obs), 33 907 Da (calcd); SMΔ6–113M: [M + H]+ = 33 924 (obs),
33 923 Da (calcd)). We then folded the purified SMs by diluting
the 8 M urea in the purification buffer to ∼60 mM and concentrating
the proteins using a centrifugal filter (MWCO 3k). The folded monomers
were examined for hemolytic activity toward rabbit red blood cells
(rRBCs) (Figure 1E).
We observed similarities between the synthetic monomers and the WT
or truncated αHL monomers produced either in E. coli or by in vitro transcription
and translation (IVTT). As expected, only SMf exhibited
hemolytic activity toward rRBCs.19 The
specific hemolytic activity of SMf was HC50 =
92 ng mL–1, which is in the same range as that of
WT αHL (HC50 = 31 ng mL–1).24 To visualize the formation of αHL heptamers,
we incubated SMf at 37 °C in the presence of liposomes
(10 mg mL–1, diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine, DPhPC),
which produced a new band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) corresponding to the size (∼240
kDa) of the heptamer (Figure 1F, left). We also incubated SMf in the presence
of rabbit red blood cell membranes (rRBCm) in different ratios with
radiolabeled WT αHL produced by IVTT. The SMf oligomerized
to form heteroheptamers with different stoichiometries (WT7–nSMn, n = 0–7) (Figure 1F, right). SMΔ6–113M and SMΔ6–113F were incubated with DPhPC liposomes (10 mg mL–1) and oligomerized to form homomeric structures11 (Figure 1G).

Electrical Properties of Two-Fragment Pores and Binding of Cyclodextrins
To examine the electrical properties of the various heptameric
αHL pores containing synthetic subunits [WT6SMf1, (SMΔ6–113M)7, and (SMΔ6–113F)7], we determined the mean
unitary conductance values under defined conditions and measured I–V curves (Figure S10a,b). The conductance values for the αHL pores
containing synthetic monomers were similar to that of pores comprising
WT αHL subunits produced by IVTT.

To confirm that the
transmembrane β barrels of the semisynthetic pores were intact,
we evaluated the binding kinetics at the single-molecule level of
cyclodextrin molecular adapters (βCD and am7βCD
(heptakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)-β-cyclodextrin)) with the WT6(SMf)1, (SMΔ6–113M)7, and (SMΔ6–113F)7 pores.25,26 It was already known that the homoheptamer
formed from TBMΔ6/M113F binds am7βCD very tightly.19,20 We determined the association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff) of
βCD for the three different protein pores. At least three measurements
were made for each construct. βCD blocks the ionic current transiently
when it is lodged within the lumen of the αHL pore. The dissociation
constants (KD = koff/kon, Figure S11) of βCD for WT6SMf1 (KD = 14.5 ± 0.4 × 10–3 M, kon = 10.0 ± 0.2 × 104 M–1·s–1, and koff = 14.5 ± 0.2 × 102 s–1) and (SMΔ6–113M)7 (KD = 6.5 ± 0.2 × 10–2 M, kon = 2.4 ± 0.1 × 104 M–1·s–1, and koff = 15.7 ± 0.3 × 102 s–1) were similar to the values obtained in our previous
studies for WT725 and (TBMΔ6–113M)7.19 The KD (6.1 ± 1.3 × 10–5 M) of βCD for (SMΔ6–113F)7 (Figure S12A) was smaller
by 3 orders of magnitude than the KD for
the (SMΔ6–113M)7 pore, which makes
sense as it is known that βCD binds more tightly by 3–4
orders of magnitude to a pore formed by the full-length M113F subunit
than it does to the WT pore.20 We also
analyzed the binding of am7βCD to the (SMΔ6–113F)7 pore (Figure S12B) and found
that it remained bound to the pore “permanently” as
previously reported for the same truncated pore produced by conventional
means.19 The binding kinetics of βCD
and am7βCD suggest that the semisynthetic protein
pores produced by two-fragment coupling, and thereby containing a
Cys mutation (S114C), are very similar to the protein pores derived
from WT αHL produced directly by IVTT from the corresponding
genes.

Two-Fragment Ligation Forms a Native Amide Bond
To
verify the existence of a native amide bond formed between Gly126
and Cys127 in SMf, we carried out thiolate chemistry on
single WT6SMf1 pores by using the side chain
of Cys-127 generated by NCL. In the absence of methyl-PEG-OPSS (MPO,
5.0 kDa), the open state of WT6SMf1 had a long
duration (>30 min). The addition of MPO (0.1 mM) to the trans compartment at +100 mV generated an irreversible current
drop (Figure 2A), due
to the formation
of a disulfide bond between MPO and the side chain of Cys-127. The
pore remained blocked over a range of potentials (−100 to +100
mV), indicating that the current drop is not due to simple clogging
of the pore. In the presence DTT (5 mM, both compartments), the open
current level was restored (Figure 2B) because the PEG chain was cleaved from the pore.

Figure 2 Reactivity
of the Cys-127 residue in WT6SMf1 αHL.
(A) WT6SMf1 was eluted from a gel
(Figure 1G), and a
single WT6SMf1 pore was established in a planar
bilayer. Me-PEG-OPSS (5 kDa, 0.1 mM, inset, n = 3)
was added to the trans compartment. The current drop
indicates a blockade caused by reaction of the PEG derivative with
the pore through the formation of a disulfide bond with the side chain
of Cys-127. (B) Addition of 5 mM DTT to both compartments cleaved
the PEG chain from the WT6SMf1 pore. The buffer
was 1 M KCl, 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.5). The currents in (A) and
(B) were filtered and sampled at 2 and 10 kHz, respectively.

Three-Fragment Ligation
To Form a Ketone-Containing αHL
Polypeptide
With NTF113M and CTF127, and a synthetic central peptide, we next carried out three-fragment
coupling to construct a full-length αHL monomer containing a
ketone group (Figure 3A). The ketone is a versatile functional group in organic chemistry
and participates in a large number of reactions.27−30 However, reactions of a ketone
have not been observed yet at the single-molecule level. The synthetic
methods used to obtain an unnatural amino acid containing a ketone
group28,29 are not very efficient, and the techniques27,30 used to incorporate a ketone amino acid into the middle of a polypeptide
chain are often arduous. We made an unnatural amino acid bearing a
ketone (Fmoc-Ket-OH; Fmoc-N6-(3-oxobutanoyl)lysine), Figure 3A, inset) from Fmoc-Lys-OH
and N-hydroxysuccinimidyl acetoacetate (NHA). Fmoc-Ket-OH
was used for SPPS of a central segment of the polypeptide chain (CSP:
Thz114ThrLeuKetTyrGlyPheAsnGlyAsnValThrGly126-Nbz), such that the Ket side chain would project into the
transmembrane β barrel of an αHL pore. CSP was prepared
with a C-terminal acylurea31 (Figures S13 and S14), which yields a peptide
arylthioester with 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA), accelerating
the NCL reaction. We then proceeded to assemble a full-length αHL
bearing the ketone group with two sequential NCL reactions (Figure S15). The final product (SMket) was purified (Figure S16) and characterized
by LC-MS (Figure 3B
and Figure S9D; [M + H]+ = 35 109
(obs), 35 107 Da (calcd)). A hemolysis assay showed that folded
SMket (HC50 = 47 ng mL–1)
had similar activity to the WT αHL monomer (Figure 3C). SMket also formed
homo- and heteroheptameric pores in the presence of liposomes and
rRBCm, respectively (Figure 3D).

(A) An αHL monomer was synthesized from three fragments with
a central segment (CSP) bearing an unnatural amino acid with a side
chain bearing a ketone group (inset: Un, Fmoc-N6-(3-oxobutanoyl)lysine,
Fmoc-Ket-OH). (B) Characterization of the synthetic αHL monomer
(SMket) by LC-MS. [M + H]+ = 35 109 (obs),

full-length synthetic αHL monomer [SMket (0.31 mg
mL–1)] lysed rRBCs. rRBCs alone (row 6 in Figure 2E) are displayed
for comparison. (D) Homo- (left) and hetero- (right) heptameric pores
formed with SMket. The pores were prepared by the same
methods described in Figure 1F,G.

We determined the mean
unitary conductance values for individual
WT6SM1ket pores in 1 M KCl and 50 mM Na acetate
buffer over a range of applied potentials (−100 to +100 mV)
(Figure S18A). The buffer was adjusted
to pH 3.4 in anticipation of an acid-catalyzed addition reaction (imine
formation) on the ketone side chain (see below). The conductance of
WT6SMket1 (0.93 ± 0.10 nS, n = 9) at +100 mV was similar to that of the WT7 pore (1.07
± 0.02 nS, n = 9) under the same conditions.
We also determined the association and dissociation rate constants
at pH 3.4 (kon and koff) for βCD binding from the values of the mean dwell
times (τon and τoff) [WT7: KD = 6.1 ± 0.2 × 10–2 M (n = 3), kon = 71.7
± 0.1 × 102 M–1·s–1, and koff = 4.4 ±
0.2 × 102 s–1; WT6SMket1: KD = 8.6 ± 0.7 ×
10–2 M (n = 3), kon = 83.7 ± 6.8 × 102 M–1·s–1, and koff = 7.2 ± 0.1 × 102 s–1] (Figure S17). The ketone residue presented by
the SM subunit affects neither the electrical properties of the αHL
pore nor its ability to bind the βCD adaptor.

Single-Molecule
Covalent Chemistry with a Ketone-Containing
αHL Pore
We then carried out imine chemistry with single
WT6SM1ket pores. We first examined the interaction
of the WT7 pore with 1.1 kDa MePEG-hydroxylamine (MPHA).
The addition of 2 mM MPHA to the trans compartment
at +75 mV in the presence of 1 M KCl, 50 mM Na acetate buffer (pH
3.4), produced short blockades (∼100 μs), which arise
from the entry of MPHA into the lumen of the pore without covalent
attachment.32 No prolonged current decrease
was observed with the WT7 pore during 2 h of monitoring.
We then added 2 mM MPHA to the trans side of the
WT6SMket1 pore, under the same conditions, which
led to a permanent current blockade at +75 mV within 10 min, presumably
due to the covalent attachment of MPHA to the ketone group within
the pore through imine formation. Interestingly, the modified WT6SMket1 pore opened at negative applied potentials
(−100 to 0 mV) with IRES = 91%
(residual current), compared with the original open state. By contrast,
at positive potentials (0 to +100 mV), the pore was almost closed
(IRES = 3.2%, Figure S18B) with very short openings (<50 ms). It follows that
the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of WT6SMket1-imine-PEG show
virtually complete current rectification (Figure S18B). Previously, we developed a diode-like αHL pore
(7R-αHL) with positively charged Arg side chains projecting
into the lumen of the transmembrane β barrel,33 allowing ions to flow only at positive potentials. We used
7R-αHL to construct a bridge rectifier circuit from droplet
interface bilayers. Therefore, the WT6SMket1-oxime-PEG pore, which shows the opposite electrical properties to
7R-αHL (Figure 4A), might be used in related applications. To confirm that the attachment
was through imine formation, we added 20 mM NH2OH to both
compartments to cleave the linkage. In ∼15 min, the current
returned to its initial level (Figure 4B), suggesting that the PEG chain had been cleaved
from the pore.

Figure 4 Single-molecule reactions of the WT6SMket1 pore. (A) A WT6SMket1 pore was reacted
with
MePEG-hydroxylamine (MPHA, 1.1 kDa, 2 mM, inset) added to the trans compartment. Reaction occurred at a positive potential
(+75 mV) and led to a permanent current blockade of the WT6SMket1 pore. The modified pore only opened at negative
applied potentials. (B) The pore was restored to an open state when
20 mM HONH2·HCl was added to both compartments to
release the PEG chain. The currents in (A) and (B) were filtered at
5 kHz and sampled at 25 kHz. For display, further digital filtering
was carried out at 2 kHz with an 8-pole low-pass Bessel filter. The
buffer was 1 M KCl, 50 mM Na acetate (pH 3.4). (C) Reversible oxime
formation in a single synthetic pore containing a ketone (WT6SMket1). Oxime formation with MPHA leads to a current
drop, while reversal with HONH2 returns the current to
its initial level. The section defined by the orange bracket is magnified
in panel D. (D) Negative potential (−75 mV, b) was applied during the PEG-oxime state (a), which
opened the pore (residual current, IRES = 91%). Subsequently, a positive potential (+75 mV, c) was applied, and the pore closed. The pore became fully open (violet
arrow) with IRES = 100% at negative potential
(−75 mV, d), presumably when the formation
of an oxime with HONH2 led to release of the pore-bound
polymer. The pore was restored to an open state at a positive potential
(+75 mV, e).

The observation of the ability of the WT6SMket1 pore to return its initial conductance level led us to
investigate
an oxime−oxime exchange reaction on the ketone side chain at
the single-molecule level. In the presence of 2 mM MPA, in the trans compartment, and 10 mM of HONH2, in both
the cis and trans compartment, a
reversible reaction was observed (Figure 4C). During the formation of the O-alkyloxime by MPHA, the current was greatly reduced to levels in
the range of 1.5 to 17 pA (Figure 4C). Subsequent transitions between this “closed”
level and the open level were apparent. The open level represents
the formation of an oxime with HONH2, and release of the
PEG chain from the pore. The formation of an O-alkyloxime
within the pore with MPHA only allowed substantial ion flow at a negative
potential (−75 mV) (orange bracket in Figure 4C and a−d in Figure 4D). After transoximination with HONH2,34 the current increased from
−56 to −67 pA at −75 mV (violet arrow in Figure 4D) and an open-level
current of +78 pA was observed during the subsequent application of
a positive potential (+75 mV).

The mean dwell time of the open
pore (τon) is
the mean lifetime of the oxime formed by HONH2 (o), which
is the mean reaction time for O-alkyloxime (ao) formation
with MPHA. Similarly, the mean dwell time of the closed pore (τoff) is the mean lifetime of the O-alkyloxime,
which is the mean reaction time for oxime formation with HONH2. The measured mean lifetimes the O-alkyloxime
and the oxime were 52 ± 2 s (n = 79) and 51 ± 2 s (n = 78)
(Figure S19), which yield rate constants
for transoximination of kf,ao = 10 M−1·s−1 and kf,o = 2 M−1·s−1, respectively, in 1 M KCl, Na acetate
buffer (pH 3.4), at +75 mV, where kf,ao = kon = 1/τon·[MPHA] and kf,o = koff = 1/τoff·[NH2OH].

Conclusions
The ability to introduce unnatural amino acids into the αHL
pore has the potential to provide a large variety of reactive side
chains for the investigation of single-molecule covalent chemistry.
We have previously produced αHL polypeptides with unnatural
alkyl and aryl amino acids by using in vitro chemically
acylated tRNAs.35 However, this approach
is demanding and often gives poor results when more than one amino
acid is introduced. The coupling of polypeptide segments by NCL has
been used extensively to produce proteins36−38 and is a favorable
alternative means to incorporate unnatural amino acids. In the present
work, we demonstrate a variety of synthetic protein pores using αHL
polypeptides and use the synthetic pore containing a ketone as single-molecule
nanoreactor.

Oxime chemistry was examined in an aqueous environment
at the single-molecule
level with a ketone-containing αHL pore (WT6SMket1), and the work described here is the first observation
of reversible covalent chemistry using an unnatural amino acid side-chain
in a nanoreactor. Oxime formation from a ketone proceeds via nucleophilic addition to form a tetrahedral intermediate,39,40 followed by the elimination of water. Transoximination also proceeds
reversibly through a tetrahedral intermediate that subsequently breaks
down to form a new oxime and a hydroxylamine.34 In our work, no intermediates were observed in both the O-alkyloxime formation by MPHA and the transoximination
reaction. Presumably, the lifetimes of the tetrahedral intermediates
are too short or the current changes too small to observe under our
recording conditions. We obtained rate constants for oxime and O-alkyloxime formation within the pore (kf,ao = 10 M−1·s−1 and kf,o = 2 M−1·s−1).
Earlier determinations in bulk solution41,42 are in the
range ∼1 to 104·M−1·s−1 and depend strongly on substituents, solvent, pH,
and temperature. In our case, the partitioning of the polymer reactant,
MPHA, into the pore must be considered.11,43

We have
observed oxime formation by using a semisynthetic pore
containing an unnatural amino acid as a nanoreactor. The ketone-containing
pore expands the range of covalent chemistry that can be studied by
the nanoreactor approach to reversible reactions for which statistically
significant data can be acquired rapidly without tedious repeats.
Taken together with our recent demonstration of alkyne chemistry,11 the versatility of the nanoreactor approach
is apparent, and we look forward to developing even more ambitious
possibilities, such as single-molecule catalysis, which may require
the placement of several different unnatural amino acids within a
single polypeptide chain.

Methods
Native Chemical
Ligation
Two-Fragment Coupling
Fifty microliters of CTF (>0.5
mM), from which pyruvate had been removed, was mixed with 50 μL
of NTF (>0.5 mM) in 0.4 mL of NCL buffer [200 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.9) containing 6 M Gu·HCl, 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP), and 200 mM 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA)] and concentrated
to 100 μL using a centrifugal filter (Amicon, MWCO 3k) at 14 000g for 20 min. The buffer containing NTF and CTF was replaced
with NCL buffer by repeated (5 times) dilution and concentration with
the same filter. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at
room temperature.

Three-Fragment Coupling
CTF (0.5
mM), from which pyruvate
had been removed, was mixed with CSP-Nbz (5 mM) in 0.5 mL of NCL buffer
[200 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.9) containing 6 M Gu·HCl,
50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 50 mM MPAA]. After
overnight reaction at room temperature, the unreacted peptide was
removed by passing the mixture through a size-exclusion column (Superdex
200 10/300 GL). The product was analyzed by LC-MS.

The N-terminal
Thz group was subsequently cleaved by treatment with 0.4 M HONH2·HCl in 200 mM NaH2PO4 buffer (pH
adjusted to 4.0) containing 6 M Gu·HCl and 50 mM TCEP for 4 h
at room temperature. For the next round of ligation, the buffer was
replaced with NCL buffer containing 200 mM MPAA by repeated dilution
and concentration with a centrifugal filter (Amicon, MWCO 3k). NTF-αthioester (0.6 mM) was mixed with the first ligation
product (0.3 mM), and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight.
The final ligation product was purified by gel filtration followed
by ion-exchange chromatography. The reaction yield was determined
by quantifying the intensity of the polypeptide bands after SDS-PAGE
by using ImageJ (NIH).
