Among the different synthesis approaches
to colloidal nanocrystals,
a recently developed toolkit is represented by cation exchange reactions,
where the use of template nanocrystals gives access to materials that
would be hardly attainable via direct synthesis.
Besides, postsynthetic treatments, such as thermally activated solid-state
reactions, represent a further flourishing route to promote finely
controlled cation exchange. Here, we report that, upon in
situ heating in a transmission electron microscope, Cu2Se or Cu nanocrystals deposited on an amorphous solid substrate
undergo partial loss of Cu atoms, which are then engaged in local
cation exchange reactions with Cu “acceptor” phases
represented by rod- and wire-shaped CdSe nanocrystals. This thermal
treatment slowly transforms the initial CdSe nanocrystals into Cu2–xSe nanocrystals, through the complete
sublimation of Cd and the partial sublimation of Se atoms. Both Cu
“donor” and “acceptor” particles were
not always in direct contact with each other; hence, the gradual transfer
of Cu species from Cu2Se or metallic Cu to CdSe nanocrystals
was mediated by the substrate and depended on the distance between
the donor and acceptor nanostructures. Differently from what happens
in the comparably faster cation exchange reactions performed in liquid
solution, this study shows that slow cation exchange reactions can
be performed at the solid state and helps to shed light on the intermediate
steps involved in such reactions.

Cation exchange
(CE) reactions1,2 in ionic crystals involve the
partial or the complete replacement
of the cation sublattice, while the anion sublattice remains in place
and is essentially preserved in the transformation,3−6 giving access to materials that
would be otherwise difficult to synthesize through a direct synthesis.7−9 This kind of process is generally based on the fast direct reactions
between inorganic colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) and cationic species,
both dispersed in the same liquid phase. In such a system, the very
dynamic nature of the reaction environment makes direct monitoring
of the process very difficult and, at present, certainly not suitable
to single-particle tracking with high spatial resolution. Classical
NC systems on which CE reactions have been tested extensively belong
to copper chalcogenides and to the II–VI and IV–VI classes
of semiconductors.3−6 Copper chalcogenides are particularly prone to CE reactions because
in these materials the formation of a large number of Cu vacancies
provides efficient pathways for cation interdiffusion and exchange.10 Bekenstein et al. recently
showed that the thermal annealing of a film of copper sulfide NCs
increased the number of Cu vacancies in the NCs, resulting in a modification
of their electronic properties.11 Similarly,
different groups investigated the variation in the optical behavior
of copper chalcogenide NCs when subject to postsynthetic processes
which modify the Cu stoichiometry, demonstrating a direct correlation
between Cu deficiency (x) in the NC lattice and the
emergence of a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).12−14 Copper chalcogenides have the additional peculiarity of undergoing
a phase transition above a thermal threshold to a superionic (SI)
phase, with highly mobile copper ions in the lattice.15−20 In particular, copper selenide (Cu2Se) transforms at
high temperature into a Cu-depleted superionic Cu2–xSe phase, characterized by a liquid-like behavior
of the Cu cations within a rigid Se sublattice having face-centered
cubic (fcc) structure.18−20 Here, we aimed to assess whether Cu2Se
NCs do lose a measurable fraction of Cu atoms from their lattice once
deposited on a substrate and annealed above a certain threshold temperature.
If so, our next goal was to clarify if the expelled Cu species could
engage in “dry” CE reactions, involving NCs of another
ionic material deposited on the same substrate, in our case either
CdSe nanorods (NRs) or CdSe nanowires (NWs). To perform this study,
we made extensive use of state-of-the-art in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and related spectroscopic
techniques. By these means, we were able to both trigger the CE process
and follow it with the highest spatial and temporal resolution.

Results
and Discussion
In Situ TEM Annealing of
sole Cu2Se Nanocrystals
As a starting experiment,
colloidally synthesized
Cu2Se NCs were placed on a TEM carbon-coated grid. Using
a TEM heating holder, careful morphostructural and chemical analyses
of the NCs were performed at room temperature (RT), before and after in situ heating. Such a heating step consisted of keeping
the holder at a target temperature for a given time. We found a threshold
temperature of 400 °C and a heating time of about 60 min as parameters
for a detectable Cu depletion in the NCs. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
of individual NCs and electron diffraction (ED) analysis on groups
of NCs (after annealing, in order to avoid any lattice thermal expansion
effect) indicated that, while the cubic structure of the initial NCs
was preserved, their lattice had slightly contracted (Figure 1A,B). In particular, linear
integrated ED profiles displayed a slight shift of the diffraction
peaks toward higher nm–1 values, in the reciprocal
space, with respect to the nonannealed NCs (Figure 1C). The main (220) diffraction peak shifted
from 4.868 to 4.921 nm–1, indicating a decrease
of about 3% of the unit cell volume that can be ascribed to a partial
loss of Cu (see the Supporting Information for further details). These data were corroborated by chemical quantification via high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HR-EELS)
using a monochromated scanning TEM (STEM) of several NCs (Figure 1D), which indicated
a decrease in the Cu/Se atomic ratio from 2.01:1 of the pristine NCs
to 1.91:1 in the annealed NC (Figure S1). Furthermore, HR-EELS analysis of the same Cu1.91Se
NCs points to a change in the electronic band structure due to Cu
depletion suffered by the crystal lattice: while in the low loss region
of the Cu2Se NCs no feature was detected (Figure 1E), an additional feature appeared
in the same region at 1.1 eV of the EELS spectrum as a consequence
of the copper depletion, as shown in Figure 1F,G and Figure S2. This was previously interpreted as directly correlated to a near-infrared
absorption band in the range from 900 to 1600 nm and arising from
a LSPR due to the presence of Cu vacancies.12−14,21

a peak at 1.1 eV in the low loss energy range (from 0.95 to 1.35 eV),
correlated to a localized surface plasmon absorption due to the collective
excitation of holes (arising from the presence of Cu vacancies) in
the valence band of Cu2–xSe. (G)
DFT simulation of HR-EEL spectrum in the low loss region of Cu2–xSe NCs, evidencing the presence
of a feature at 1.1 eV in the same energy range of 0.95–1.35
eV, which is instead absent in a NC of stoichiometric Cu2Se.

HR-EEL Spectrum’s
Density Functional Theory Simulations
of the Cu2Se Nanocrystals after Annealing
To further
confirm that the feature observed in the low loss EEL spectrum at
1.1 eV was due to copper depletion, we modeled a HR-EEL spectrum of
a Cu2–xSe finite crystal via density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the
random phase approximation (see Materials and Methods for further details). The modeled EEL spectrum (Figure 1G) was in good agreement with
the experimental data, providing ample support to the influence of
the loss of Cu atoms on the electronic band structure of the NCs.

In Situ TEM Simultaneous Heating of Cu2Se Nanocrystals and CdSe Nanorods
A second set of
experiments was then aimed at assessing if the expelled Cu species
could activate CE reactions of other nanostructures equally arranged
on the same substrate. The natural choice fell on CdSe, as NCs of
this material have been shown to undergo rapid CE in solution even
at RT.3 In this case, spherical Cu2Se NCs (whose transformation upon annealing was reported in
the first paragraph) were deposited on the TEM grid’s carbon
film together with CdSe NRs. The different morphologies of NCs made
their two populations easily distinguishable, as shown by the high-angle
annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image reported in Figure 2A,B.

space. (D) Comparison between integrated linear profiles of ED patterns
collected at RT pre- (magenta) and post-400 °C treatment (orange),
revealing that the phase transformation occurred on the CdSe nanorod’s
component of the original mixture: the RT electron diffraction profile
is indexed as a mixture of cubic antifluorite Cu2Se and
wurtzite CdSe, while after 400 °C treatment, only the cubic Cu2–xSe phase is found. The weak and
broad peak at about 4.4 nm–1 could be ascribable
to a Cu2Se compound with monoclinic structure.28 (E) Normalized energy-filtered TEM mapping acquired
at RT and revealing clearly Cu (green) and Cd (red) localization in
the Cu2Se and CdSe NCs, respectively. (F) Normalized energy-filtered
TEM mapping acquired at 400 °C and revealing that the exchange
in the nanorods occurred between Cu (green) and Cd (red).

Before annealing, the sample was analyzed by mapping
various regions
of the grid in order to rule out any structural or compositional evolution
taking place already at RT. Chemical analysis of single NCs, performed
in STEM mode via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(STEM-EDX), yielded Cu2Se and CdSe stoichiometries for
the two types of nanostructures, respectively. Indexing of the linear
integrated ED patterns, obtained from the same regions, confirmed
the stable coexistence of both cubic antifluorite Cu2Se
and hexagonal wurtzite CdSe, as displayed in Figure 2C,D.

In the present work, each set
of EFTEM maps recorded during the
annealing experiments was treated according to an a priori noise-normalizing approach with the aim to minimize the human-based
biasing effects, control the background, and improve the signal-to-noise
ratio within the data set. Hence, this approach, once applied to the
thermally sensitive Cu2Se–CdSe system, allowed discriminating
and comparing more clearly the faint signals of chemical species involved
in CE reactions over time.22 Normalized
energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) elemental mapping then proved the spatial
localization of Cu and Cd in the two different types of NCs (Figure 2E). Annealing was
performed using the same temperature ramps of the first experiment,
and after 60 min at 400 °C, the Cu2–xSe NCs exhibited a stable Cu1.85Se stoichiometry,
revealing therefore a loss of Cu from their lattice. Moreover, Cd
was no longer present in the rods, whose composition had become Cu1.96Se, as assessed by STEM-EDX analysis. As no secondary nucleation
of Cd-rich phases was observed on the carbon film, we concluded that
the Cd species had sublimated under the high-temperature and vacuum
conditions (see Table S2). Normalized EFTEM
mapping confirmed the absence of Cd and the diffusion of Cu into the
initial CdSe NCs (Figure 2F), while differences in intensity observed between Cu1.85Se NCs and Cu1.96Se nanorods should be attributed
to the consistent differences in mean thicknesses of the two populations
(i.e., ∼7 nm for the nanorods and ∼12
nm for the NCs). Linear integrated ED pattern profiles of ensembles
of NCs were indexed according to the cubic Cu1.85Se phase
alone, denoting the complete transformation of the initial hexagonal
wurtzite CdSe phase (Figure 2C,D). Annealing caused shrinkage in volume of both the Cu2Se and CdSe NCs. However, while the Cu1.85Se NCs
suffered only a small variation in average diameter, the starting
CdSe NRs underwent a remarkable decrease in their mean length, from
34.8 to 21.9 nm, and a minor decrease in diameter, from 7.6 to 7.2
nm (Figure 2B). This
corresponded to an average decrease in rods volume of 44%, estimated
by approximating their shape to that of small cylinders, well above
the theoretically volume contraction (12%) expected in going from
wurtzite CdSe to antifluorite Cu2Se, if a complete preservation
of the Se anions would be assumed. Therefore, during the Cd →
Cu CE reaction, part of the Se sublattice of CdSe sublimated, causing
an additional volume loss of 36%, and that could be ascribed to concomitant
causes, as discussed in the following. First, the binding energy of
atoms on the apical facets is generally lower than that of the atoms
inside the crystal lattice. This aspect, along with the change of
crystal potential, due to cationic substitution and structural transition
at high temperature, may promote the partial Se sublimation from the
tips of NRs under the high-vacuum conditions of the TEM, also taking
into account the very high vapor pressure of both Cd and Se, which
moreover scales with the temperature, as reported in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. Second, this occurrence
should be also attributed to the case-to-case availability of Cu2Se NCs acting as Cu donors for the CdSe nanorods. Once the
threshold temperature for CE has been crossed and the CE reaction
has started, if the quantity of locally available depleted Cu is not
sufficient for a complete Cd-to-Cu substitution, a partial sublimation
of Se from the anionic sublattice is triggered in order to preserve
the electroneutrality of the nanorod structure. Similarly to the case
of the Cd species, we concluded that the depleted Se sublimated under
the high-temperature and vacuum conditions. As reported in detail
in the Supporting Information, this allowed
us to roughly calculate the free energy variation (ΔRG) of the corresponding overall reaction: this is
negative (−138.6 × 103 kJ) and indicates that
the exchange is thermodynamically favored under the experimental conditions.

Notably, neither reshaping nor shrinkage was observed in CdSe NCs
annealed under the same conditions but in the absence of Cu2Se NCs, which supports our hypothesis that the sublimation of Cd
from the CdSe NCs was triggered by Cu atoms and partially destabilized
the Se atoms, too, as clearly shown in Figure S3.

The evolution in the composition of the CdSe nanorods
during the
annealing from RT to 400 °C was studied by normalized EFTEM mapping,
and the relevant results are reported in Figure 3. Here, the normalized EFTEM maps displayed
an incipient onset of the exchange reaction at 350 °C, with Cu
substituting Cd in the nanorods, as confirmed by the yellow zones
in the map, which indicate local superimposition of Cd and Cu maps.
At this temperature, we expected the start of Cd and Se sublimation
and the consequent volume shrinkage of NRs. At 400 °C, the conversion
of the nanorods from CdSe to Cu1.96Se was complete, with
almost complete sublimation of Cd.

Figure 3 Sequences of normalized EFTEM elemental
maps of Cu2Se
NCs and CdSe nanorods acquired at different temperatures. No CE reaction
was observed between RT and 300 °C, with spatially distinct maps
of Cd and Cu. At 350 °C, a partial superposition in the Cd and
Cu maps indicates the beginning of CE reactions activated by the free
Cu species, which randomly diffuses over the carbon film; note the
dispersed Cu signal between the nanoparticles. After 30 min at 400
°C, the Cu CE reaction is completed. Color code: Cu, green; Cd,
red; scale bars = 50 nm.

HRTEM observations revealed that, upon CE, the hexagonal
close-packed
(hcp) sublattice of Se anions in the initial CdSe NCs was reorganized
into a cubic (fcc) sublattice. The lattice transformation preserved
the close-packing direction, namely, [0001]hcp in the initial
wurtzite CdSe and [111]fcc in the final antifluorite Cu1.96Se rods (Figure 4A–C). Moreover, by performing fast HRTEM analysis while
annealing the sample, we could visualize (Figure 4D,E) a gradual modification of the CdSe crystal
structure, already at 350 °C, with the formation of sequential
extrinsic stacking faults along the initial [0001]hcp direction
of the CdSe rods. The formation of these structural defects therefore
changed the local strain field at the nanoscale within the crystal
lattice, as assessed via peak pairs analysis (PPA)25 (see Materials and Methods) reported in Figure 4D,E. Here, the shear strain field in the right region of the nanorod
was almost unchanged from 350 to 400 °C, as in this temperature
range the rod was able to retain the wurtzite CdSe structure, while
compressive shear zones (blue) were compatible with the occurrence
of intrinsic planar stacking faults. Conversely, the shear strain
field in the left region exhibited a significant increase combined
with a growth of tensile shear zones (red and yellow) from 350 to
400 °C, as shown by the integrated shear strain line profiles.
This might be correlated to the formation of pervasive extrinsic planar
stacking faults, due to the transformation of the Se crystal sublattice
from wurtzite CdSe to antifluorite Cu2–xSe, namely, from the hexagonal ABABAB to the final cubic ABCABCAB
close-packing, during Cu cation exchange and Cd sublimation reactions.

In Situ TEM Simultaneous Heating of Cu2Se Nanocrystals and CdSe Nanowires
We carried out
additional experiments in which wurtzite CdSe NWs instead of rod-shaped
NCs were used as Cu acceptors. They gave rise to the same CE reaction
observed with the CdSe rods. In this direction, the normalized EFTEM
maps acquired under different thermal conditions (Figure 5B,E,H) indicated the occurrence
of CE reactions and the evolution of the Cu signal with increasing
temperature. While the Cu signal in the RT map was localized only
on the Cu2Se NCs, an additional faint Cu signal was discriminated
over the carbon film already at 350 °C. HRTEM characterization
confirmed the transformation from hexagonal hcp CdSe NWs into the
corresponding cubic fcc Cu2Se (Figure 5C,F,I). In such a case, CdSe NWs at RT exhibit
the main {0002} and {112̅0} lattice planes of an hcp structure
in perpendicular vector orientation, as confirmed by Fourier analysis
(FT inset of Figure 5C) compatible with the [1̅100] zone axis projection. At 350
°C, the NWs exhibited a cubic structure characterized by evident
{111̅} and {11̅1} lattice planes forming an angle of 70°
and pervasive {11̅1} planar stacking faults crossing the lattice.
The corresponding Fourier analysis, compatible with the [011] zone
axis projection of a fcc structure, revealed accordingly a strong
linear streak consistent with this type of defective structure (FT
inset of Figure 5F).
Finally, at 400 °C, the totally exchanged NWs evidenced only
lattice sets of cubic fcc Cu2–xSe. In particular, Figure 5I and the FT inset display the [011] HRTEM zone axis projection
of an exchanged NW exhibiting the typical {111̅} and {11̅1}
lattice planes of a fcc structure forming an angle of 70°, as
depicted in the Fourier analysis.

was found. (I) HRTEM imaging of nanowires after thermal CE showing

Moreover, the use of few CdSe nanowires, surrounded by many
Cu2Se NCs, enabled us to observe the Cu CE fronts moving
along
the length of the wires, as shown in Figure S4, and revealed the two-dimensional diffusion of Cu species on the
substrate over time. In regard to this, the EFTEM maps, acquired under
different thermal conditions (Figure 5B,E,H) and normalized according to the method reported
in ref (22), exhibited
an evolution of the Cu signal with increasing temperature.

In Situ TEM Simultaneous Heating of Metal Cu
Nanocrystals and CdSe Nanorods
In order to confirm the role
of the copper source in the CE reaction mechanism observed between
Cu2Se NCs and CdSe NRs, further experiments were performed
using metal Cu NCs as copper donors. The concentration of Cu NCs was
lowered with respect to the experiments involving Cu2Se
NCs in order to verify whether full or partial CE could still be observed
by decreasing the net amount of copper available to the reaction.
The results, summarized in Figures 6 and S5, indicate that CE
takes place in the CdSe NRs, with the concomitant structural and chemical
transformation to Cu2–xSe. The
CE was also found to be dependent on the local surface density and
proximity of the Cu NCs deposited on the TEM substrate. The Cu NCs,
visible as coarse cuboidal nanoparticles among the CdSe rods in Figure 6A,B, underwent partial
dissolution during heating, and the released copper was engaged in
CE with the adjacent CdSe NRs, as indicated in Figure 6C,D. The CE was always found to progress
from the rods’ end, along the c-axis (Figure S5B). In particular, detailed characterization
by HRTEM revealed examples of both partially and fully structurally
transformed and exchanged rods. In analogy with the previous experiments,
as the CE reaction progressed, the same directionality was maintained
between the exchanged and unexchanged parts of the NRs; that is, [0001]hcp was converted into [111]fcc (Figure S5), with an epitaxial interface between the exchanged
and unexchanged parts of the rod and with the orientation relationship
⟨0110⟩{0001}CdSe∥⟨011⟩{111}Cu2–xSe. This, along with the preferential
shrinking also observed in the case of Cu2Se//CdSe CE reactions
indicates that the c-axis of the nanorods offers
a preferential direction of CE front in the CdSe lattice. The EFTEM
images acquired after annealing at 400 °C for 90 min and displayed
in Figure 6E,F also
show that CdSe NRs in close proximity to the Cu NCs underwent CE,
while other CdSe NRs that were isolated and flanked by other NRs underwent
partial or no CE and retained most of the Cd in their structure, as
confirmed by an EDX compositional analysis of individual NRs. This
supports our hypothesis that the Cd expulsion from the rods is driven
by copper in-diffusion and CE in the rods, rather than being only
an annealing effect. In particular, Figure 6G,H shows that an isolated cluster of CdSe
rods more than 300 nm away from the copper source (in such a case
an array of Cu NCs) also underwent CE, confirming the very high mobility
of the Cu species diffusing on the substrate at 400 °C. In order
to eliminate a possible electron beam effect during the CE in the
presence of Cu NCs, solid-state CE annealing experiments were performed ex situ in a furnace under conditions similar to those in
the TEM column: similar chemical CE and structural transformation
were observed here, as well.

composition before annealing) located more than 300 nm away from Cu
source and (H) corresponding elemental map (Cu, green; Cd, red) after

to Cu2–xSe.

Our experiments indicate that the free Cu species, once expelled
from their original and local source, reach the acceptor particles
and there give rise to a thermally activated CE reaction. One potential
mechanism for distributing such free Cu species over the CdSe NRs/NWs
(and therefore enable CE) is via vapor phase diffusion.
In such case, the expelled Cu should recondense from the vapor phase
on the hot TEM grid. However, this appears unlikely for a series of
reasons. First, the sample was heated under high and dynamic vacuum
and with a cryogenic trap located in close proximity to the sample
that should promptly adsorb any chemical released by the sample by
sublimation. Second, in the unlikely event of recondensation of copper
from the vapor phase, then under the high-vacuum conditions in which
the experiment is performed, such Cu should have recondensed uniformly
and isotropically over the whole substrate and enabled CE also on
NRs/NWs that were far from any Cu2Se/Cu NC. This is contrary
to our observation of a locality effect in CE, as more distal NRs/NWs
were less affected by CE or were not exchanged at all. Finally, if
Cu was able to recondense on the substrate, a similar fate should
have occurred to the sublimated Cd and (in part) Se species. Then,
we should have been able to map the presence of Cd and Se in regions
that were not initially occupied by CdSe NRs/NWs.

A more plausible
scenario is that the copper species expelled by
the Cu2Se/Cu NCs diffuse over the amorphous substrate that
constitutes the mechanical support for the nanostructures in the TEM
grid. Two pieces of experimental evidence support this second scenario.
First, our normalization approach to the whole set of EFTEM images
collected at the different samples’ temperatures allowed us
to make them coherent in terms of signal-to-background discrimination,
permitting then to attribute the increase in the Cu signal (observed
on the amorphous substrate already at 350 °C) to the out-diffusion
of the Cu species expelled from Cu2Se NCs, which could
then reach the CdSe particles, as expected for a simple thermal diffusion
process over an amorphous substrate.23 Second,
there is a proximity effect on Cu depletion of the NCs acting as copper
sources, which is strongly in favor of a surface diffusion process.
After annealing, the chemical composition of the original Cu2Se NCs, acquired via STEM-EDX, showed a variation
in Cu depletion of the NCs that depended on their distance (D) from the CdSe NWs: the composition of the NCs ranged
from Cu1.83Se (when D < 100 nm) to
Cu1.92Se (when 100 nm < D < 500
nm). An analogous effect was observed also when Cu NCs were used instead
of Cu2Se as local sources of copper for the in
situ CE reaction. In this case, the Cu content in the partially
or fully exchanged CdSe NRs markedly depended on the proximity of
the copper source, the Cu NCs, and the presence of other Cu scavengers
on the substrate along the diffusion path (other CdSe NRs), ranging
from Cu2.1Se in close proximity to the cluster of Cu NCs
to Cu1.5Se further away from the copper source. Finally,
as expected, we observed that—once the activation energy to
start the CE reaction had been reached by crossing the threshold temperature—its
kinetics, that is, the rate of CE reaction, increased with increasing
temperature. Besides, we also noticed that such a rate depends on
the type of cation donor species. Even if elucidating the reasons
for these differences is beyond the main aim of this paper, further
experimental studies and theoretical simulations are currently being
performed in our groups to shed more light on such issue.

Since
the exchange was observed not only on CdSe NCs directly in
contact with Cu2Se NCs but also on those several nanometers
apart, this leads us to discuss a second and fundamental point, the
latter concerning the migration mechanism followed by the copper expelled
by the NCs acting as its sources: which was its oxidation state during
the diffusion on the substrate? In this case, it would be unlikely
for the Cu species to leave the Cu2Se NCs as charged ions
and thermally diffuse on the substrate. A more plausible explanation
is that thermal annealing causes a release of Cu species from the
Cu2Se NCs as zerovalent (Cu0) atoms that can
move randomly on the amorphous carbon film, similarly to the two-dimensional
diffusion process of metallic atom species over a substrate.23,24 Also, it is unlikely that the amorphous nature of the carbon film
could allow the expelled Cu0 atoms to follow any favored
migration paths and therefore to self-organize into clusters along
certain preferential directions. Since both species involved in the
exchange (Cu and Cd) exist as cations only when they are in the NCs,
and as the NCs evolve from CdSe to Cu1.96Se, this chemical
and structural transformation can be considered as a CE reaction mediated
by an intermediate step with migrating Cu0 free atoms.
Furthermore, this Cu0-mediated process was corroborated
by the thermally driven CE reaction occurring in CdSe when metallic
copper NCs instead of Cu2Se NCs were used as Cu donor nanospecies.

The cation exchange reactions observed in all the experiments were
triggered solely by annealing. We found indeed that the thermal CE
between CdSe and Cu2Se took place also in those areas that
were never directly exposed to the electron beam irradiation, occurring
even in samples heated at 400 °C in the TEM with the beam blanked
(Figure S6), as well as in the CdSe rods
in the presence of Cu NCs on a TEM grid heated ex situ. We additionally tested a Si3N4 support as
a different type of amorphous substrate, and also in this case CE
took place at 400 °C (Figure S7),
indicating that the unreactive chemical nature of the substrates does
not affect the migration of the copper and the consequent in situ CE reaction. We finally carried out additional experiments
outside the electron microscope, by annealing similar CdSe and Cu2Se samples in the high-vacuum prechamber of an X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (XPS), followed by their immediate XPS analysis at different
temperatures with no air exposure (Figure S8). These experiments confirmed our previous findings and ruled out
any role of electron irradiation in the CE reactions.

Conclusions
We showed how thermally activated cation exchange reactions involving
different kinds of NCs deposited on the same substrate can occur and
be studied by an in situ TEM approach. Besides, we
showed that such CE reactions, when performed in a solid state, took
tens of minutes to be completed: their kinetics is much slower than
in the liquid phase, where they often take only a fraction of a second
to reach completion. This calls for further investigations aimed at
understanding whether the observed phenomena can take place even when
both the donor and acceptor species (Cu2Se/Cu and CdSe
NCS, respectively) are assembled as extended aggregates and, consequently,
how the NC aggregation state (i.e., the possible
degree of order/assembly of the NCs) could influence the thermally
driven solid-state CE reaction. Our in situ TEM approach
to the study of the solid-state exchange reactions could then open
interesting perspectives in identifying the intermediate states of
such transformations and could be applicable to many other combinations
of materials. It could additionally pave the way to methods for the
modification of chemical composition, crystal structure, and physicochemical
properties of materials at a local scale.

Materials
and Methods
Synthesis of NCs
Syntheses were carried out following
standard published procedures. All details on synthesis and processing
of the NCs are reported in the Supporting Information.

In Situ TEM Thermal Heating Experiments
In situ thermal heating experiments were performed
within the TEM column, that is, under high-vacuum conditions (pressure P ∼ 1.5 × 10–5 Pa), using
a dedicated single tilt heating holder capable of reaching a maximum
temperature of 800 °C. In those experiments that required the
concomitant presence of both copper cation donor (Cu2Se
NCs or Cu NCs) and acceptor (CdSe rods or CdSe wires) species on the
ultrathin carbon-coated gold TEM grid, these species were not deposited
on the grid from a common solution. Instead, two sequential depositions
of the respective solutions were made on the TEM grid. This procedure
was followed in order to minimize as much as possible any cation exchange
reaction already in the solution phase, that is, prior to deposition
and annealing.

Before the in situ experiments
were performed, these samples were cleaned with ethanol and heated
at 130 °C in a pumping station (P ∼ 10–3–10–4 Pa) in order to eliminate
the residuals of excess surfactants. Note that this treatment should
not remove quantitatively the surfactants bound to the surface of
the NCs. In situ TEM thermal treatment of all samples
was carried out according to a common protocol: the system was initially
heated from room temperature to 300 °C at a heating rate of 5
°C min–1 and afterward up to a reaction temperature
of 400 °C at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min–1. This helped to minimize thermal drift and enabled monitoring the
exchange reaction over time after its thermal activation.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy Characterizations
HR-EELS Analysis
This was performed in STEM mode with
a FEI Titan 80-300 Cube with double spherical aberration correction
of both condenser and objective lens, working at an accelerating voltage
of 300 kV and equipped with an ultra-bright-field emission gun (XFEG),
an electron monochromator, and a GIF Quantum ERS energy spectrometer,
with a final energy resolution of 0.10 eV (at KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi
Arabia) for the Cu2Se NCs and of 0.07 eV (at McMaster University,
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) for the Cu2–xSe NCs. In both experiments, HR-EELS analysis was carried out
in single range mode, focusing on the low loss energy region from
0 to 20 eV and with an exposure time of 1 ms per pixel on an area
of 0.1 μm2, yielding a total exposure time of 75
s per investigated region. Detailed chemical analysis via EELS was carried out in TEM and STEM mode (spectrum imaging) using
a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope, working at 200 kV, equipped with field
emission electron source, a GIF Quantum ER energy filter, and a Gatan
K2-Summit direct detection camera (at Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA,
USA). The EELS spectra were acquired from 300 to 2300 eV energy range
in order to detect any fine variation in the energy profile of the
Cd M-edge (404 eV), Cu L-edge (931 eV), and Se L-edge (1436 eV), with
an exposure time of 8 ms per pixel on an area of 0.25 μm2, yielding a total exposure time of a few minutes per investigated
region.

HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, STEM-EDX, and EFTEM Analysis
These
measurements were performed by a JEOL JEM-2200FS microscope, working
at 200 kV, equipped with a Schottky electron source, a CEOS spherical
aberration corrector of the objective lens, an in-column Omega energy
filter, and a Gatan US1000 CCD camera (at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,
Genova, Italy). Spatially resolved chemical analysis of NCs was performed
in STEM mode via EDX using a Bruker Quantax 400 XFlash
6T silicon drift detector (SDD) with an area of 60 mm2.
STEM-EDX analyses were carried out at room temperature before and
after the heating experiments in order to avoid saturation of the
SDD detector due to infrared thermal emission of the heated TEM holder.
Elemental maps via EFTEM imaging were acquired using
a contrast aperture of about 10 mrad to reduce aberrations, mostly
chromatic, and using the three-window method (one post- and two pre-edge)
to extract the background. The elastic (zero loss) image was acquired
as reference with a 10 eV wide energy slit; then, elemental maps using
Cu L-edge (931 eV) and Cd M-edge (404 eV) were acquired on the same
area of zero loss with energy slits of 50 and 30 eV, respectively,
and normalized according to the method reported in ref (22).

Electron Diffraction Analysis
Selected area electron
diffraction patterns (SAEDPs) were acquired using a FEI Tecnai G2
F20 microscope working at 200 kV, equipped with a Schottky electron
source and Gatan US1000 CCD camera with a high-sensitive thick scintillator
(at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy). Cubic Cu2–xSe and hexagonal CdSe SAEDPs were
indexed using ICSD card no. 67050 and no. 41491, respectively.

Strain
Field Analysis
The strain field was measured
using the peak pairs analysis25 starting
from the HRTEM images. Strain maps, displaying the in-plane components
of the symmetric strain tensors, were generated by considering the
deformation stored in the rod lattice. Within the PPA method, the
structural displacements, uij, of the
atomic columns were used to calculate the in-plane shear strain tensor, , considering as the lattice basis vectors
the 0002 and 101̅0 “structural reflections”. The
coordinates of uij displacements
were chosen such that the x-axis was parallel to
the [0001] crystal axis, corresponding to the rod elongation, as well.

DFT Simulations of the Low Loss EEL Spectrum
The low
loss EEL spectrum was modeled via DFT using the random
phase approximation (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package).26 The projector-augmented wave method (plane wave
cutoff energy of 800 eV) was employed, together with the generalized
gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation functional in
the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof flavor.27 Both Cu2Se and Cu2–xSe were optimized up to an energy convergence of 10–5 eV and a force convergence of 4 meV/Å. Monkhorst–Pack k-meshes of 8 × 8 × 8 (structure relaxation) and
16 × 16 × 16 (optical calculations) points were used for
Brillouin zone integrations. The DFT simulations were carried out
considering a stoichiometric Cu2Se crystal and a virtual
Cu-depleted Cu2–xSe crystal, both
with fcc antifluorite structure and a √2 × √2 ×
1 unit cell size. The Cu-depleted Cu2–xSe crystal was obtained by removing one atom of Cu from the
total 16 Cu and 8 Se atoms. This removal, due to the cubic symmetry
of antifluorite phase, generates 6.25% vacancies of Cu in the crystal
lattice corresponding to Cu1.88Se stoichiometry (which
is a close estimate of the vacancy concentration that was measured
experimentally). The imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric
tensor was obtained from the first-principles eigenstates and afterward
the real part by means of the Kramers–Kronig relations. Thus,
the EEL spectrum was determined in the random phase approximation.
