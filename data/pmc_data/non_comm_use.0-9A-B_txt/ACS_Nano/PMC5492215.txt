Graphene provides
a two-dimensional platform for contacting individual
molecules, which enables transport spectroscopy of molecular orbital,
spin, and vibrational states. Here we report single-electron tunneling
through a molecule that has been anchored to two graphene leads. Quantum
interference within the graphene leads gives rise to an energy-dependent
transmission and fluctuations in the sequential tunnel-rates. The
lead states are electrostatically tuned by a global back-gate, resulting
in a distinct pattern of varying intensity in the measured conductance
maps. This pattern could potentially obscure transport features that
are intrinsic to the molecule under investigation. Using ensemble
averaged magneto-conductance measurements, lead and molecule states
are disentangled, enabling spectroscopic investigation of the single
molecule.

Graphene
electrodes are advantageous
for use in single-molecule devices,1−5 because unlike metal electrodes, they do not suffer from high atomic
mobility and screening.1,3 Large area single-layer graphene
can be grown and patterned into devices with electrodes separated
by nanogaps,6,7 and molecules bridging the gap
can be anchored to the electrodes via covalent bonding4 or π–π-stacking.1−3,8,9 However, the nontrivial
density of states and transmission in graphene nanostructures, combined
with the fact that graphene can be electrostatically gated, can lead
to the observation of transport features in graphene-based single-molecule
devices that are not intrinsic to the molecule under investigation,
but are rather a property of the leads. Experimental and theoretical
studies have shown that quantum interference in graphene ribbons10−13 and nanoconstrictions14 lead to conductance
fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures. Quantum confinement in the
source and drain electrodes of semiconductor single-electron transistors
results in the observation of density of states oscillations in the
sequential electron tunneling transport through these devices.15,16 It is therefore to be expected that quantum interference effects
in graphene electrodes will also influence the charge transport in
single-molecule devices.

Here we present a transport spectroscopy
investigation of a graphene-based
single-electron transistor where we attribute the sequential electron
tunneling to the presence of a single molecule bridging the graphene
nanogap. While the charge island is most likely formed by an individual
zinc-porphyrin dimer, the observed transport features are completely
independent of the type of molecule used, and in fact can also be
observed in graphene quantum dots in a similar device geometry (see Supporting Information, where we present experimental
data of zinc-porphyrin monomers and graphene quantum dots). Our experiments
show how the graphene leads couple electrostatically to a global back-gate,
and that hybridization between the lead and molecule states results
in distinct fluctuation patterns as a function of gate and bias voltage.
This behavior is captured by a simple tight-binding model, which we
solve both analytically and numericially. Finally, we present a strategy
to recover transport features that are intrinsic to the molecule,
and might be obscured by the density of states fluctuations in the
leads, by disentangling lead and molecular states.

Results and discussion
We measured charge transport in single-molecule transistors at
4.2 K (sample A) and 20 mK (sample B) as a function of bias voltage Vb and gate voltage Vg. Individual molecules were contacted using chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) grown graphene nanogaps on a silicon substrate with a 300 nm
thermally grown oxide layer that was prepatterned with metal (Cr/Au)
contacts. The single-layer nature of the graphene was confirmed by
Raman spectroscopy.14 The graphene nanogaps
were fabricated using feedback-controlled electroburning.7 Single zinc-porphyrin dimer molecules were deposited
from a chloroform solution, and were identified by comparing current
maps as a function of Vb and Vg before and after deposition (see Supporting Information).

We have measured a total of
171 successfully electroburnt devices
(meaning they were successfully burnt, did not break during the wire-bonding
and cool-down procedure, and resulted in a measurable tunnel current
at 77 K.) From these 171 devices, 109 were measured again at 77 K
after the molecular deposition after which 26 devices appeared empty
before the deposition (i.e., no Coulomb diamonds) and showed sequential
tunneling after molecular deposition. We observed conductance fluctuation
in 4 devices.

The conductance through the single zinc-porphyrin
dimers was investigated
via single-electron tunneling from a metallic source reservoir via
the left graphene lead, through the molecule, to the metallic drain
reservoir via the right graphene lead (Figure 1a). The silicon substrate was used as a backgate
to apply Vg. In contrast with metal-based
single-molecule transistors, where the metal electrodes screen the
gate electric field, in our devices the electrostatic gating influences
both the molecular orbital states and the states in the graphene leads
(Figure 1b). Previous
experiments using partially electroburnt graphene nanoconstrictions
have shown that the transmission of our graphene leads fluctuates
as a function of Vb and Vg, which we attribute to either universal conductance
fluctuations (UCFs) resulting from random disorder or the presence
of multimode Fabry-Pérot interferences.14 These fluctuations in the graphene leads influence the
transmission through the molecule as orbital states are tuned in and
out of resonance with the lead states.

conductance as a function of bias and gate voltage.

Figure 1c shows
the differential conductance measured as a function of the applied
bias and gate voltage for sample A. The data reveal a dense set of
positive and negative conduction resonances visible as red and blue
lines of positive slope that we attribute to fluctuations in the graphene
leads. A striking feature of the data is that the red and blue lines
do not run parallel to the lines at the edges of white regions of
suppressed conductance. In what follows, we will discuss the origin
of the conduction resonances and analyze the electrostatic gating
of the molecule and the lead states.

For charge to flow through
a molecule, electrons need to be added
and removed from it. The energy required to add one electron to the
molecule, i.e., its electron affinity, is given by the electrochemical
potential μM(N) = U(N) – U(N – 1), where U(N) is the
total energy of the N-electron redox state.17 This electrochemical potential consists of the
discrete orbital energy plus the electrostatic contribution to the
energy, which depends linearly on the source (drain) Vs(d) and gate Vg voltage as
μM = −|e|(Cs,MVs + Cd,MVd + Cg,MVg)/(Cs,M + Cd,M + Cg,M), where the capacitance Cs(d,g),M describes the electrostatic interaction between the source (drain,
gate) electrode and the molecule.18 Electrons
can tunnel through the molecule when its electrochemical potential
is within the bias window defined by the electrochemical potentials
μs = −|e|Vs and μd = −|e|Vd in the source and drain reservoirs,
respectively. When μd is outside this bias window,
electrons do not have the necessary energy to occupy/empty an orbital,
resulting in diamond-shape regions of Coulomb blockade in the conductance
versus bias and gate voltage map. The slopes of these Coulomb diamonds
are given by the conditions μM = μd and μM = μs. When the device is
biased asymmetrically and the gate voltage is set relative to one
of the electrodes, in our case the drain, i.e., Vs = Vb and Vd = 0, these conditions yield the slopes Cg,M/(Cd,M + Cg,M) and −Cg,M/Cs,M.

Similar to the molecular orbital
states, the states in the graphene
leads shift linearly as a function of the applied bias and gate voltage.
The energy shift of the states in the left lead, which is coupled
to the source reservoir, is given by ΔϵL =
−|e|(Cs,LVs+Cg,LVg/(Cs,L+Cg,L), and for the right lead coupled to the drain reservoir
ΔϵR = −|e|(Cd,RVd+Cg,RVg/(Cd,R+Cg,R). In the case of asymmetric
biasing, lines in the conductance map for which a molecular orbital
aligns with a state in the left lead have a slope given by μM = ΔϵL, which yields 1  and for states in the right lead μM = ΔϵR yields 2  

When the lead states are
clamped to the electrochemical potential
of the reservoirs, i.e., if the capacitive coupling between the leads
and the gate is zero, the slope of the lines for which the molecular
orbitals align with the lead states run parallel to the edges of the
Coulomb diamonds. Parallel lines in conductance maps resulting from
disorder and confinement in the leads of single-electron transistors
have been studied extensively, for example in STM-fabricated devices
in silicon.15 However, when there is capacitive
coupling between the leads and the gate, these lines no longer run
parallel to the edges of the Coulomb diamonds, and resonances between
molecular and lead states shift in and out of the bias window.

From the slopes of the edges of the Coulomb diamonds in Figure 1c we infer that the
ratio Cg,M/Cs,M = (33 ± 1) × 10–3, and Cg,M/Cd,M = (20 ± 1) ×
10–3. The relatively strong coupling to the source
and drain electrodes compared to the gate electrode is due to the
fact that the backgate is separated from the device by a 300 nm layer
of SiO2. Next, we estimate the electrostatic coupling of
the lead states to the backgate. We only observe conduction resonances
with positive slopes, which implies that we predominantly probe the
left lead. From the positive slope of the conduction resonances we
find Cg,L/Cs,L = (7 ± 1) × 10–3, indicating that the
gate coupling to the molecule is approximately 3–5 times stronger
than to the lead states. We attribute the difference in gate coupling
between the molecule and the lead states to the higher carrier concentration
in the graphene leads, which results in a more effective screening
of the gate electric field. The average spacing between the conduction
resonances is approximately 5 meV, which is consistent with the conductance
fluctuations we have previously observed in partially electroburnt
graphene nanoconstrictions.14

We
will now discuss the hybridization between the lead states and
the molecular orbitals as they are tuned in and out of resonance.
The current through a molecular orbital is given by the Landauer formula19 3  where fL,R denotes
the Fermi distribution of the reservoirs, which in the case of asymmetric
biasing depends on the bias voltage Vb and temperature T as fL = [exp((E–eVb)/kBT) + 1]−1 and fR = [exp(E/kBT) + 1]−1.

To investigate the role of scattering in the leads on the
transmission
through the molecular orbital we employ a simple Hückel (tight-binding)
model as shown in Figure 2a. The molecule is represented by a single site at n = 0 with an on-site energy μM and a hopping
integral γL,R to the left and right lead, respectively.
The left and right leads are represented by semi-infinite chains with
on-site energies ϵL,R and nearest-neighbor hopping
integrals αL,R. We introduce scattering into the
left and right compound electrodes at n = −NL and n = NR by adjusting the hopping integrals βL,R.

Figure 2 Partitioning the molecule-lead system. (a) Schematic depiction
of the Hückel model. (b) Partitioning of the system into simple
electrodes A and B with a complex scattering region S, and (c) into
“compound electrodes” L and R and a simple scatting
site M.

Traditionally one would regard
this structure as a complicated
scatterer (S) consisting of the region between −NL ≤ n ≤ NR (shaded gray in Figure 2b) and two simple crystalline leads (shaded orange
in Figure 2b) along
which electrons propagate ballistically into and from the reservoirs.
For such a system, 4  where ΓA and ΓB describe
the level broadening due to contact with the crystalline
semi-infinite leads, A and B. In this expression, the scatterering
region is a complex combination of the molecule and graphene and GSS is the Green’s function of the scattering
region in the presence of the simple crystalline leads. Our aim is
to separate the contributions to scattering from the molecule and
graphene and therefore we adopt an alternative formulation20 in which the left graphene, and left semi-infinite
lead, i.e., the region n < 0, are regarded as
a compound electrode (L) and the right graphene and right semi-infinite
lead (n > 0) form the right compound electrode
(R).
This viewpoint is encapsulated in the following alternative expression
for the transmission coefficient, which is mathematically equivalent
to eq 4 5  In this equation, the level broadening due
to contact between the molecule and the left and right compound electrodes
are described by 6   7  where gLL(RR) is
the Green’s function of the isolated left(right)-hand compound
electrode, and HL(R)M denotes the coupling
between the left(right) compound electrode and the molecule. The Green’s
function of the molecule in the presence of the compound electrodes
is given by 8  where the
self-energies of the left and right
compound electrode are 9   10  Using eqs 5 and 6–10, we obtain the Breit–Wigner
formula 11  In the case of the simple Hückel
model,
this implies that the tunnel-rate ΓL is proportional
to the local density of states at site n = −1
and ΓR is proportional to the local density of states
at site n = +1. Both the tunnel-rates and the energy
shifts depend on the electrode density of states, which in turn is
determined by the random locations of scattering centers within the
graphene electrodes. The self-energies of the compound electrodes
in the Hückel model can be found numerically by decimation
(for details see Supporting Information), or analytically by solving Dyson’s equation (see Supporting Information). The latter yields 12  where xL = βL2/αL2 – 1 and kL = cos–1 (ϵL – E)/2α. Similarly ΓR is obtained by
replacing L by R in the above expression. Here we
have derived the transmission for a simple one-dimensional Hückel
model, however eqs 4 and 5 are completely general, and the transmission function
will depend on the details of the system Hamiltonian (see Supporting Information for a more sophisticated
system Hamiltonian). Experimentally, we find that the position of
the molecular energy level with respect to the Fermi energy of the
leads and the strength of the coupling between the molecule and the
graphene leads varies significantly from device to device.

Figure 3a,b shows
the real and imaginary part of the self-energies for strong and weak
reflections in the leads. For strong reflection (βL,R2 = 0.1αL,R2) we find sharp
peaks in the imaginary part of the self-energies, i.e., the density
of states at the surface sites (n = ± 1), arising
from quasi-bound states between the molecule and the reflection sites
(n = −NL, NR). By contrast, for weak reflections (βL,R2 = 0.9αL,R2) we find a small
sinusoidal modulation of both the tunnel-rates ΓL,R and the energy shift σL,R. The tunnel-rate is maximum
on resonance with the quasi-bound lead states while the hybridization
energy changes sign upon crossing the resonance condition. The transmission
as a function of energy and electrochemical potential of the molecule
μM (Figure 3c) shows both the effect of the modulation of the tunnel-rate
and the hybridization energy. The transmission is maximum upon resonance,
reflecting the increase in tunnel-rate, and a avoided crossing appear
around the resonance condition due to level repulsion resulting from
the hybridization between the molecular orbital and the lead states.

and hybridization energy. (a,b) Real and imaginary
part of the surface Green’s function calculated for αL,R = 3 eV, ϵL,R = 0 eV and l = 1000. (c) Transmission as a function of energy E and on-site potential μM for γL,R = 20 meV.

To calculate the current
and differential conductance as a function
of bias and gate voltage as shown in Figure 1e, we introduce the experimentally extracted
capacitive coupling parameters to the on-site energies as discussed
in the previous section. By choosing αL,R = 1 eV
and NL = NR = 1000 we obtain an energy-level spacing between the quasi-bound
lead states of 2 meV, close to the observed energy spacing in our
experiment. We find that choosing the hopping integrals γL = 4 μeV and γR = 20 meV results in
a good qualitative agreement between the experimental and theoretical
differential conductance maps. Due to strong asymmetry in coupling
strength between the left and right lead, i.e. ,ΓL ≪ ΓR, the amplitude of the Breit–Wigner
resonance ∼ ΓL and is only sensitive to states
in the left lead.

The conductance fluctuations observed in the
sequential tunnelling
regime arise from interference effects in the leads, which can either
be the result of scattering of random impurities leading to universal
conductance fluctuations (UCFs, see Figure 4a), or Fabry-Pérot (FP, see Figure 4b) interferences
resulting from reflections at potential barriers. UCFs can be observed
if electron waves scatter along closed trajectories and the phase
coherence length lϕ is larger than
the mean free path. This scattering leads to random, energy dependent
interferences within segments of lϕ2 inside the conductor which
appear as aperiodic conductance fluctuations as a function of gate
voltage. When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene
leads, electron waves acquire an additional phase due to the vector
potential, resulting in an Aharonov–Bohm phase ΔBAB = Φ0/S,
where Φ0 = h/e,
for a trajectory enclosing an area S. When the conductance
is measured for different magnetic fields within the correlation field
scale ΔBc ≈ Φ0/(Lx + Ly), where Lx and Ly correspond to the smallest relevant dimension in x and y direction, similar features corresponding
to a specific impurity configuration are observed in each conductance
curve.21,22 However, when the increments in external
magnetic field are larger than ΔBc, a different impurity configuration is probed for each conductance
curve. As a result, UCFs can be suppressed by ensemble averaging measurements
recorded at B > ΔBc, denoted by ⟨...⟩B. This technique
was
successfully used to distinguish between UCF and weak-localization
effects in nanowires23 and carbon nanotubes.24 Theoretically, the UCFs can be reduced by a
factor of √N where N is the
size of the ensemble.24Figure 4f shows bias traces as a function
of magnetic field recorded at Vg = 29.75
V of sample B measured at 20 mK (indicated by the dotted line in Figure 4c). We recorded 40
traces in B⊥ = Bz (Figure 4d) and 40 traces in B∥ = Bx,y (Figure 4e). For a phase coherence length lϕ ≈ 400 nm14 found
in our graphene samples ΔBc ≈ 25 mT, and therefore ΔB⊥, ΔB∥ >
ΔBc. While the out-of-plane magnetic
field changes
the conductance fluctuations (Figure 4e), the in-plane field up to 6 T does not affect the
oscillations (see Figure 4d). The fact that only the out-of-plane magnetic field influences
the conductance fluctuations further strengthens our assumption that
they are intrinsic to two-dimensional graphene leads rather than the
molecule. By comparing the conductance at B = 0 with
the data averaged over B we find a reduction of UCFs
of var(G(B = 0))/var(⟨G(B)⟩B) ≈ 6 very
close to the theoretical value of .

as a function of bias voltage and magnetic field in (∥) and

Single- and multimode
FP interference effects have previously been
observed in graphene ribbons and nanoconstrictions.14 The Lorentz force acting on the electrons in a FP cavity
will curve their trajectories when an external magnetic field is applied,
which leads to the semiclassical (kinetic) phase difference ϕWKB between two neighboring trajectories.25 In addition, bent trajectories enclosing an area S will accumulate an Aharonov–Bohm phase ϕAB = eB⊥S/ℏ = Φ/Φ0. Finally, back-reflected
electrons in graphene acquire a Berry phase ϕBerry, which is π for single-layer graphene and can take values
between 0 and 2π in bilayer graphene depending on its carrier
density and asymmetry parameter, which is defined as the difference
in on-site energies of the two graphene layers.26 Since the Berry phase is not affected by the external magnetic
field, and therefore does not play a role in magnetic-field averaging,
it can be ignored in this discussion. The resonance condition for
Fabry-Pérot interferences is met when ϕWKB + ϕAB + ϕBerry = 2πj, where . Variations of the external magnetic field
will change this condition and thus shift the conductance maxima due
to the combined influence on ϕWKB and ϕAB (see Supporting Information).
Ensemble averaging of the magneto-conductance traces will therefore
result in the suppression of density of states fluctuations. This
behavior can be illustrated by a tight-binding model shown in Figure 5a, in which the leads
contain circular regions through which a magnetic flux can pass. Again
the transmission coefficient can be obtained analytically as a function
of the flux Φ passing through each of the loops. This is imposed
via a Peierls substitution by adding a phase factor θ = 2πΦ/Φ0 to nearest neighbor hopping integrals. In the absence of
a magnetic field, Figure 5b,c shows an example of the transmission and differential
conductance, which reflects the density of states fluctuations in
such a model. The ensemble averaged curves show a strong reduction
of the fluctuations, in correspondence with the experimental results.

conductance at B = 0 compared to the ensemble averaged
values, calculated for αring,L = αring,R = 0.7αL,R and γL = γR = 0.075αL,R.

Conclusions
In this work we have investigated the role of
density of states
fluctuations in single-molecule devices contacted to single-layer
graphene nanoelectrodes. By analyzing local measurements of the quasi-bound
lead states, we find that the electrostatic coupling to the global
back-gate is weaker than the gate coupling to the molecule. This enables
electrostatic control over the hybridization between lead and molecule
states. While the effect of quantum interference is in most cases
detrimental to the investigation of molecular properties, because
intensity variations in the conductance maps are hard to distinguish
from the molecular features, it may provide a pathway toward interference-based
molecular transistors. If the energy-spacing between the quasi-bound
lead states can be increased by further quantum confinement, they
may act as an energy filter for the transport through the molecular
orbitals.27,28

Our approach of ensemble averaging
magnetoconductance traces provides
an effective way of distinguishing between features that are intrinsic
to the molecule and those that are the result of quantum interference
in the leads. This provides a useful tool for the spectroscopic investigation
of single molecules, for example for the identification of vibrational
states.29 However, orbital excited states
are likely to shift as a function of the magnetic field due to their
orbital angular momentum, and will therefore not be amenable to the
ensemble averaging technique described in this work. The same holds
for single-molecule magnets, which exhibit a large magnetic anisotropy.
Nevertheless, the fact that the conductance lines resulting from the
lead states do not run parallel to the edges of the Coulomb diamond
may still be used to distinguish between lead and molecular states.
In the case where magnetic ensemble averaging is not possible, e.g.,
when studying magnetic molecules, a coplanar gate30 could potentially reduce the effects of density of states
fluctuations in the leads as it will only gate the molecule states
locally.

To conclude, our results highlight the importance of
the electronic
properties of the lead electrodes in single-molecule electronics.
While graphene may be a material system that is very well suited to
host these devices, further understanding of the hybridization between
graphene and molecules will be needed to develop these devices into
a technology. Atomically precise control of the structure and edge
termination of the graphene leads,31 together
with stacked two-dimensional material approaches32 could enable functional graphene-molecule hybrid systems.

Methods
Devices are fabricated
using feedback-controlled electroburning
of CVD grown graphene ribbons that were wet-transferred onto a pre-patterned
Si/SiO2 chip containing Au/Cr contact pads. We deposit
molecules from a 10 μM chloroform solution. Devices were measured
in an Oxford Instruments Triton 200 dilution refrigerator and a custom-built
liquid helium dipper. Measurements were performed using low-noise,
battery powered electronics. We measure the transport characteristics
of the device before and after molecular deposition and select those
device that only show Coulomb blockade after deposition.
