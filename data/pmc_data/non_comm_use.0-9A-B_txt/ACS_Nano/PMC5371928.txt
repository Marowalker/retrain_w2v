There is a potential for silver nanowires
(AgNWs) to be inhaled,
but there is little information on their health effects and their
chemical transformation inside the lungs in vivo.
We studied the effects of short (S-AgNWs; 1.5 μm) and long (L-AgNWs;
10 μm) nanowires instilled into the lungs of Sprague–Dawley
rats. S- and L-AgNWs were phagocytosed and degraded by macrophages;
there was no frustrated phagocytosis. Interestingly, both AgNWs were
internalized in alveolar epithelial cells, with precipitation of Ag2S on their surface as secondary Ag2S nanoparticles.
Quantitative serial block face three-dimensional scanning electron
microscopy showed a small, but significant, reduction of NW lengths
inside alveolar epithelial cells. AgNWs were also present in the lung
subpleural space where L-AgNWs exposure resulted in more Ag+ve macrophages
situated within the pleura and subpleural alveoli, compared with the
S-AgNWs exposure. For both AgNWs, there was lung inflammation at day
1, disappearing by day 21, but in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF),
L-AgNWs caused a delayed neutrophilic and macrophagic inflammation,
while S-AgNWs caused only acute transient neutrophilia. Surfactant
protein D (SP-D) levels in BALF increased after S- and L-AgNWs exposure
at day 7. L-AgNWs induced MIP-1α and S-AgNWs induced IL-18 at
day 1. Large airway bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine increased
following L-AgNWs, but not S-AgNWs, exposure. The attenuated response
to AgNW instillation may be due to silver inactivation after precipitation
of Ag2S with limited dissolution. Our findings have important
consequences for the safety of silver-based technologies to human
health.

==== Body
Silver nanomaterials
are increasingly
used in industrial and domestic products ranging from odor-resistant
socks, personal care products, respiratory devices, food storage boxes,
computers, and cleaning sprays. Silver nanowires (AgNWs) with a high
aspect ratio are also becoming important in the field of optoelectronics,
where they are used in the production of transparent, conductive thin-film
electrodes for touchscreens, smart phones, and computers.1,2 Potentially, there is a high risk of aerosolization associated with
industrial processes that manufacture nanolayer films, involving the
deposition of tiny droplets of suspensions of AgNWs onto surfaces,3 and therefore of increased risk of inhalation
by such workers.4

Inhalation and
instillation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) mainly
as nanospheres have been reported to induce dose-dependent inflammation5,6 and alterations in lung function, including bronchial hyperresponsiveness.7−9 A very limited number of studies have investigated the toxicity
of AgNWs in vivo. AgNWs ≥ 5 μm in length
instilled directly into the pleural cavity induced pulmonary inflammation,
and those >10 μm induced “frustrated phagocytosis”.10,11 Intratracheally instilled AgNWs produced similar length-dependent
frustrated phagocytic responses, including macrophage clumping and
ineffective clearance from the lungs, together with a neutrophilic
and eosinophilic response induced by the long (20 μm) and short
(2 μm) AgNWs.12 With these very limited
available studies, little is known about how the shape or aspect ratio
of AgNWs can affect uptake, processing, and biopersistence by lung
cells, or if the release of Ag+ ion in vivo alters signaling pathways or leads to alterations in pulmonary function.
There is growing evidence that AgNPs and AgNWs can enter epithelial
cells, interstitial sites, airway smooth muscle cells, the vascular
endothelium, and the pleural membrane.10−12 Another aspect is that
interaction of nanoparticles with lung lining fluid containing pulmonary
surfactant is known to influence uptake of nanowires by alveolar epithelial
cells13 and also the aggregation of nanowires
for clearance by alveolar macrophages.14 Moreover, the effect of AgNWs on the trafficking or production of
surfactant proteins such as surfactant protein D (SP-D) is unclear.

We hypothesized that AgNWs could undergo oxidative dissolution
as silver ions (Ag+), and so the chemical nature of the
AgNWs in the local environment would change with time. Therefore,
both size-aspect ratio and Ag+ ion release and transformation
to Ag salts could be critical in determining the biopersistence and
cytotoxicity of AgNWs. This process of intracellular transformation
has been demonstrated in our previous work for a single AgNW length
in in vitro cell cultures,15 and a recent study demonstrated the intracellular transformation
of spherical AgNPs into nano-Ag2S on the surface.16 There is no evidence so far that this process
occurs in vivo. There is also no understanding of
how this high aspect ratio nanomaterial is distributed, internalized,
and transformed inside lung cells in vivo, how this
process is influenced by AgNW length, and whether these processes
could be correlated to inflammatory responses, pulmonary function
and responsiveness, and the persistence of silver in the lungs. Therefore,
in this study, we use backscattered and serial block face scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) to map and generate three-dimensional (3D)
volume reconstruction of the morphology of the AgNWs inside the alveoli.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with energy dispersive–X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) were used to characterize the size, bulk, and surface
chemistry and any chemical and morphological transformations of instilled
short and long AgNWs (1 and 10 μm length) in vivo.(17) This information was correlated to
length-dependent biological responses of AgNWs in the lung by measuring
inflammation, chemokine and cytokine profiles, alterations in surfactant
composition, and pulmonary function.

Results/Discussion
Characteristics
of Long and Short Silver Nanowires
The polyvinyl pyrrolidone
(PVP)-capped short silver nanowires (S-AgNWs)
have been characterized previously.15,17 S-AgNWs (Figure 1a,b) had an average
length of 1.6 ± 1.4 μm (Figure 1c) and an average diameter of 72 ± 36
nm (Figure 1d), as
measured by TEM. High-aspect ratio long silver nanowires (L-AgNWs)
(Figure 1e,f) have
a similar average diameter of 73 ± 37 nm (Figure 1h), but a longer average length of 10.5 ±
8.5 μm (Figure 1g). From dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, the average
hydrodynamic sizes of the S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs were 807 ± 66 nm
and 1447 ± 94 nm, respectively. For both types of AgNWs, the
measured hydrodynamic sizes were not representative of the sizes measured
by TEM. This is because NW size information in DLS is obtained by
measuring the particle’s diffusion coefficient, which in the
case of high-aspect ratio NWs has both a translational and rotational
component. The measured sizes may therefore be interpreted only as
the sizes of spherical Ag particles that would have the same diffusion
coefficient as S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs. However, using light microscopy,
we have previously shown that in the absence of pulmonary surfactant
components, AgNWs did not agglomerate during up to 7 days of incubation.14 In the case of L-AgNWs, the interplanar spacing’s
measured from selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were
0.235, 0.204 and 0.144 nm, corresponding to the (111), (200), and
(220) planes of metallic silver (ref no. 01-087-0597). TEM energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra collected from several L-AgNWs showed
that they consisted of pure Ag, confirming the absence of impurities
from the synthesis product, and that no sulfidation had occurred on
the material. A summary of the properties of the AgNWs used is given
in Table 1.

2D and 3D Imaging of Nanowires in the Lung
Since we
had seen various types of staining in cells and the lung in response
to the AgNWs, we were interested in the chemical speciation of silver
in the lung tissue alveolar Type II (ATII) cells and the macrophages,
especially due to the possibility of transformative processes such
as dissolution and sulfidation, which have so far only been seen in in vitro exposures of lung cells for both AgNWs as well
as for AgNPs.13,18 We used a combination of 2D and
3D SEM, high resolution phase contrast imaging (HRTEM), and EDX to
visualize the location of the AgNWs within the cells and to characterize
their chemistry. Imaging was performed at 24 h after instillation
of the S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs. The data are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

respectively. The insets are FFT patterns of the corresponding HRTEM
images. (f, l) EDX spectra collected from areas as marked in (d, j)

from positions in panels f and I (area 2, in each case) were 0.91
± 0.20 and 0.54 ± 0.11, respectively.

Silver Nanowires
Both the S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs were
found in the alveoli using SEM and TEM; the backscattered electron
detector was used in the SEM to generate contrast from the AgNWs (Figure 2a,b,g,h). The AgNW
samples were analyzed by spatially resolved analytical EM techniques
to study whether the AgNWs had dissolved or transformed to other compounds
in the alveoli. Changes to the morphology of the AgNWs were observed
at the end of the S-AgNWs located inside an ATII cell (Figure 2c,d). The interplanar spacing
measured from a high-resolution (HR)TEM image acquired from the tip
of the S-NW (Figure 2e) was 0.331 ± 0.010 nm, corresponding to the (012) plane of
monoclinic silver sulfide Ag2S (ref no. 00-014-0072). STEM-EDX
analysis showed that Ag2S was detected on the surface of
the S-AgNWs by STEM-EDX (Figure 2f, spectrum 2); the core of the S-AgNWs consisted of
pure Ag (Figure 2f,
spectrum 1). Only carbon was detected from the background (Figure 2f, spectrum 3). Partially
sulfidised AgNWs were also found with the L-AgNWs inside the ATII
cells (Figure 2g–l).
In 2D projection images, it was not possible to measure the length
of the S-AgNWs, therefore we used serial block face SEM (Figure 3a–e) to generate
3D volume reconstructions of the AgNW inside the structural cells
(Figure 3d,e; Supporting Movie). Since dissolution and transformation
were the same for S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs, their morphological and chemical
evolution inside the lung in vivo was examined by
3D SEM for the S-AgNWs only. Figure 3a–c show selected SEM images from a serial block
face data set taken over a volume of 40 × 40 × 11 μm
as well as a visualization of the two cells within this region containing
S-AgNW. After segmentation of individual S-AgNW, their length distribution
was quantified. The histogram of internalized S-AgNW lengths revealed
that the S-NW contained within the cells were significantly shorter
compared to the instilled material (p < 0.05)
(Figure 3f,g).

Lung Inflammation
Following instillation with AgNWs,
there was a mild to moderate inflammation with infiltration of inflammatory
cells in the bronchial and vascular walls and alveolar septa and also
exudates in the alveolar space in Sprague–Dawley rat lungs
(Figure 4A–D).
Overall, tissue inflammation scores were significantly increased in
lungs of all silver-instilled groups at day 1, and this subsequently
fell at 7 and 21 days (Figure 5A). Inflammatory cells were distributed patchily and consisted
mainly of neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophages, and also
of some lymphocytes. The inflammatory responses were similar across
the AgNW groups. Foreign body reactions, such as giant foreign body
macrophages, were not observed in the lungs instilled with AgNWs.

(K), and more silver-positive cells deposited in subpleural connective
tissue or alveolar space or septa in L-NW-instilled lungs (L) (scale

Localization and Quantification
of Silver in the Lung
Following instillation of AgNWs, aggregated
Ag particles were visible
in tissue macrophages and also in alveolar epithelial cells (Figure 4 E–H). Some
of the macrophages had diffuse brown-staining radiating away from
the black particles, indicating that the AgNPs were likely to be dissolving.
Most of time, the macrophages had fully phagocytosed the S- and L-AgNWs.
The silver-laden macrophages were sparse but located throughout the
lung tissue, mainly in alveolar spaces and septa (Figure 4E–H) and some in the
patchy inflammatory areas within the walls of the bronchi or blood
vessels. S- and L-AgNWs were found in similar locations in the lung
at 24 h. Cells containing silver were also found in subpleural connective
tissue and in the adjacent subpleural alveolar spaces and septa (Figure 4I–L). Remarkably,
individual, intact alveolar macrophages contained remnants of the
AgNWs at 24 h and 7 days after instillation suggesting that there
was no frustrated phagocytosis (Figure 4E–H, M–P). The L-AgNW-instilled lungs
had more Ag+ve macrophages situated at the pleural interface and in
subpleural alveoli, compared with that observed following exposure
to the S-AgNWs (Figure 5C).

The number of cells containing silver particles, quantified
using the autometallographic method, across the lung excluding the
subpleural space and in the subpleural space are shown in Figure 5B,C, respectively.
There was a significant increase in Ag+ counts in the lungs
with both S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs at 24 h compared to controls or to instillation
of silver nitrate. There was then a decrease in Ag+ve cells after
S-AgNW instillation at days 7 and 21. By contrast, the Ag+ve cells
remained elevated after L-AgNW instillation at these time points.
Interestingly, in the subpleural space, while both L-AgNWs and S-AgNWs
exposure led to an increased number of silver-containing cells, the
L-AgNWs induced the greatest change at 24 h. At 7 and 21 days, but
only after L-AgNW instillation, significant numbers of Ag+ve cells
were still present.

BAL Inflammation
There was a small
increase in neutrophils
after S-AgNW instillation at day 1, accompanied by no other inflammatory
changes at days 7 and 21 (Figure 6A–D). By contrast, there was no effect of L-AgNWs
at day 1, but there was an increase in macrophage numbers at day 7,
with a small nonsignificant eosinophilic response only at day 7. Following
silver nitrate instillation, there was a small increase in neutrophils
at day 1 and in macrophages at day 7 and day 21.

Data shown as mean ± SEM *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to (C).

Oxidative Stress and Surfactant Protein Levels
There
were no changes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) total protein after
AgNW instillation or silver nitrate instillation at any time point
(Figure 6E). There
was also no change in malonaldehyde (MDA) levels at 1 day postexposure
with silver nitrate, but the S-AgNWs caused a significant reduction
in MDA at day 1 only and both S- and L-AgNWs nonsignificantly increased
MDA levels at day 7. Levels of MDA were unchanged at day 21 (Figure 6F). BAL total phospholipid
was not significantly increased for any of the Ag instillations at
1 day postexposure. At 7 days, instilled silver nitrate induced a
decrease in phospholipid. L-AgNWs induced significant increases in
total phospholipid levels at day 21 (Figure 6G). The most marked increases in SP-D levels
occurred after 7 days for both S-AgNWs and L-AgNWs, with the highest
increase for L-AgNWs; silver nitrate instillation caused a small nonsignificant
increase at day 7. By 21 days, SP-D had returned to baseline values
(Figure 6H).

BAL Chemokines
and Cytokines
Instillation of silver
nitrate induced increases in the cytokines KC, MIP-1α, MCP-1,
TNF- α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 (but not
in IFNγ, IL-17A or IL-13) at day 1, with these levels returning
to baseline by day 7 (Figure 7). The profile of release of cytokines was different between
the short and long nanowires: the S-AgNWs caused the release of KC,
IL-18, and IL-13, while L-AgNWs caused a significant release of KC,
IL-1β, MIP-1α, and IL-6, with a nonsignificant increase
in IL-17A, MCP-1, or TNFα. The increased levels of cytokine/chemokine
release were normal by day 7. L-AgNWs induced an increase in IL-18
and IFNγ at 21 days.

Lung Mechanics
Large airway resistance (Rn) did not
change after silver nitrate or S-AgNW or L-AgNW instillation. Rn responsiveness
to acetylcholine was increased at 1 (P < 0.05)
and 7 (P < 0.01) days after L-AgNW treatment compared
to the control response (Figure 8). There were no increases in tissue resistance (G) noted after instillation of S- or L-AgNWs or Ag+, and there was no increase in responsiveness to acetylcholine either
(Supporting Information, Figure S1). Tissue
elastance (H) was elevated at 1 day but returned
to baseline by 7 days after silver nitrate or S-AgNW or L-AgNW instillation,
and there was a small increase in response to the highest dose of
acetylcholine at days 1 and 7 for the L-AgNWs (Figure S2).

or L-NW at days 1, 7, or 21. Data shown as mean ± SEM *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared
to zero acetylcholine concentration.

We investigated the fate and the toxic effects of instilled
AgNWs
in rat lung. Most interestingly, we showed that a small fraction of
the AgNWs can penetrate the epithelial cell lining particularly in
ATII cells, and within this cell type they dissolve and Ag2S nanoparticles reprecipitate on their surface. On the other hand,
aggregated AgNWs, through the effect of the airway lining fluid containing
phospholipids and surfactant proteins, were taken up by lung macrophages.
These nanowires were found to be shorter within the macrophages and
epithelial cells. Silver-containing cells were increased not only
in the alveolar compartment but also in the subpleural space within
the first 24 h for both S- and L-AgNWs; however, only for the L-AgNWs
was there persistence of silver-positive cells beyond day 1. There
was a relatively mild transient degree of inflammatory response with
little evidence of an oxidative stress or protein exudation, but associated
with an acute release of cytokines. The mild inflammatory response
may be linked to the dissolution and transformation of the surface
of the AgNWs to Ag2S seen intracellularly, here in ATII
cells, and also inside J774 macrophage cells in vitro,16 and hence their inactivation leads
to a reduced dissolution rate of the nanowires.

The inflammatory
responses that we observed with the AgNWs were
milder when compared to that previously observed with silver nanospheres
in the same species and when administered intratracheally with an
even lower amount of silver of 0.1 mg/kg.9 We observed an acute effect in the lungs occurring at day 1 only
for both nanowires, and intraluminally, there was an acute neutrophilic
response with the S-AgNWs with a more delayed response with the L-AgNWs
at day 7 with predominant macrophage response. The cytokine response
in BAL showed that out of the acute phase cytokines measured, a differential
increase at day 1 of IL-18 with the S-AgNWs and of IL-6, IL-1β,
and MIP-1α with the L-AgNWs. IL-18 is known to promote neutrophil
activation, reactive oxygen species, cytokine release, and degranulation19,20 and, therefore, could underlie the mild neutrophilic responses seen
with S-AgNWs, but there was no evidence of oxidative stress or other
cytokines released. On the other hand, MIP1α is a chemoattractant
for inflammatory cells such as monocytes, T cells, and eosinophils,
while IL-6 and IL-1β are also mediators of monocytic and neutrophilic
inflammation that could underlie the acute inflammatory phase response
in lungs and the more delayed response in BAL fluid (BALF) after instillation
of long NWs. Thus, the L-AgNWs caused a longer lasting inflammatory
response associated with a greater variety of cytokine response than
the S-AgNWs, compatible with the longer persistence of silver-positive
cells seen with the L-AgNWs.

By contrast, we have previously
shown that instillation of PVP-coated
AgNPs of 20 nm diameter induced a high degree of neutrophilia and
levels of KC at day 1,9 levels similar
to that seen after instillation of AgNO3 in the present
study, together with an increase in oxidative stress, as evidenced
by an increase in malonyldehyde at day 1. Taken together, this suggests
that the dissolution of AgNWs seen here and in situ in our previous work14 may be responsible
for the differential inflammatory and oxidative stress changes because
the rate of dissolution from AgNWs would be much slower compared to
dissolution of silver nanospheres, since the surface area:volume ratio
of the AgNPs is 5.27- and 5.36-fold greater than that of the AgNWs,
short and long wires, respectively. It also follows that the lesser
dissolution rate of the L-AgNWs compared to the S-AgNWs for the same
amount of silver may contribute in part to its greater persistence.

Despite the attenuated response in terms of inflammation, there
was an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine seen
maximally at day 1 and absent by day 21 after instillation of L-AgNWs
but not of S-AgNWs. This response is reflective of the large airways
and not of the small airways or lung parenchyma where most of the
tissue-associated AgNWs were localized to ATII cells. In comparison,
silver nanospheres of 20 nm in diameter and PVP-capped also increased
airway hyperresponsiveness at day 1.7 Whether
this could result from the direct interaction of the AgNPs with airway
smooth muscle cells in the large airways, the site of airway hyperresponsiveness, is unclear. Again, it is likely that this effect of L-AgNWs on bronchial
hyperresponsiveness and not of the S-AgNWs may be the result of the
greater persistence of the L-AgNWs. Further studies of the direct
interactions of airway smooth muscle cells, the putative site of airways
hyperresponsiveness, with AgNWs are warranted, and the effect of silver
ions also examined. Importantly, from the medical point of view, our
observation indicates that these AgNWs could also predispose those
exposed to AgNWs to the development of asthma, which is characterized
by airways hyperresponsiveness.

Using quantification by the
autometallographic method, we showed
that both types of AgNWs accessed the alveoli following instillation.
Electron microscopy confirmed that some of the S- and L-AgNWs were
internalized by a small number of ATII cells. Intracellularly, transformation
of the S and L-AgNWs was observed, with precipitation of Ag2S on their surface and as secondary Ag2S nanoparticles.
In our previous work, incubation of S-AgNWs with a commercially available
porcine-derived surfactant preparation (Curosurf), as well as separate
components of murine lung lining fluid, provided no evidence of sulfidation
of the AgNWs in any of these components.14 Therefore, we assume that, in the present work, this transformation
has occurred intracellularly, following uptake of the AgNWs by ATII
cells. Consequently, the reduction in the length distribution of internalized
S-AgNWs, compared to the as-synthesized S-AgNWs, may be due to this
dissolution-reprecipitation process that leads to disintegration of
their original structure and fragmentation into shorter parts. In
support of this hypothesis, in vitro uptake of AgNWs
by immortalized human alveolar type 1-like epithelial cells led to
dissolution and sulfidation of the AgNWs.18 This process of NP sulfidation has also been observed when AgNPs
were incubated with a J774 macrophage cell line in vitro.(16) We suggested that sulfidation occurred
through the action of sulfide species, including H2S, HS–, or S2–, which are present inside
human lung tissues. Since no evidence of cytotoxicity was observed,
we proposed that the precipitation of Ag+ ions released
from the AgNWs as highly insoluble Ag2S may act as a detoxification
mechanism that could limit their short-term toxicological effects.
A recent study employing synchrotron-based transmission X-ray microscopy
(TXM) and X-ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) shows that,
during uptake and exocytosis from THP-1 macrophages, 20 nm AgNPs were
gradually transformed, first into Ag–O– and then Ag–S–
forms,21 correlating with key events of
cellular toxicity, suggesting that the particulate form of AgNPs and
their degraded forms play synergistic roles in mediating AgNP cytotoxicity.
Using XANES, Ag+ ions released from 60 nm AgNPs inside
primary murine macrophages were shown to form complexes with thiolate
groups, with glutathione identified as the most likely ligand.22 However, these studies need to be confirmed
using AgNWs.

Furthermore, the majority of the AgNWs were not
found in alveolar
type 1 epithelial cell (ATI) or ATII cells, but instead aggregated
AgNWs were visible in tissue macrophages (Figure 4E–H), which in most cases had fully
phagocytosed the S- and L-AgNWs. Therefore, a large proportion of
AgNWs reaching the deep lung would be cleared by alveolar macrophages.
In our in vitro work, ATII secretions (containing
both the complete lipid and protein complement of human pulmonary
surfactant) reduced AgNW uptake by ATI cells.13 This reduction in uptake possibly involved specific binding of SP-A
and SP-D to the AgNWs,13 which we have
found induces AgNW agglomeration.14 A change
in the agglomeration state of AgNWs could affect the response of different
cell types, improving their uptake efficiency by macrophages but reducing
it by epithelial cells. This effect may have therefore led, in part,
to the large number of aggregated S- and L-AgNWs observed here in
tissue macrophages, but not in epithelial cells. Similarly, in a recent
study by Silva et al., instillation of AgNWs of two
different lengths (2 and 20 μm) in rats led to significant numbers
of Ag-positive macrophages from day 1 through to day 21.12

Change in SP-D protein is an important
factor in influencing nanoparticle
interaction with the lung lining fluid that in turn may determine
their uptake by alveolar epithelial cells and also the aggregation
state of the nanoparticles, which will determine their phagocytosis
by macrophages.23 We saw a prominent increase
in SP-D in BALF at day 7 after both the S- and L-NWs, suggesting increased
ATII synthesis and/or release of SP-D in response to NW exposure and
possibly related to the observed preferential epithelial localization
of the nanowires. SP-D is an important immunomodulatory protein which,
for example, has been shown to subdue Th2-type responses, modulating
macrophage and dendritic cell function as well as T-cell-dependent
inflammatory events. Importantly, SP-D also plays an important role
in pathogen clearance from the lung, through specific binding to microorganisms
and enhancing macrophage uptake. SP-D adsorption by AgNWs13 leading to increased aggregated AgNWs may be
favored by the presence of high levels of SP-D in the bronchoalveolar
space,24 thus enhancing the clearance of
AgNWs. Thus, our work indicates that the role of the different components
of surfactant in moderating the aggregation, uptake, translocation,
and clearance of S- and L-AgNWs (and other nanomaterials with different
aspect ratios) is important, also impacting immune defense mechanisms.
On-going studies in our laboratory aim to understand these mechanisms
in greater depth to better anticipate any impact of human exposure.

Exposure to both S- and L-AgNWs also led to an increased number
of silver-containing cells in the lungs and in the subpleural space,
with the highest effect observed for L-AgNWs at 24 h. By 7 and 21
days, while S-AgNWs had disappeared from this site, L-AgNWs still
persisted. In the work by Silva et al., AgNWs of
both lengths were found in the pleural regions at day 1, but only
nonparticulate Ag could be detected at days 7 and 21.12 These findings suggest that some of the AgNWs deposited
in the lungs move through the pleura. There is evidence that a fraction
of any type of particles that have deposited in the distal regions
of the lung can translocate to the pleural space.25 The pathway by which these particles reach the pleura from
the lung parenchyma may involve lymphatic flow from the parenchyma
to the pleural space, but it is incompletely elucidated. Clearance
of particles or fibers from the pleural space appears to be length
dependent. This clearance occurs through passive removal in the flow
of pleural fluid out of the pleural space into the lymphatic system,
with stomata or pores (∼3–10 μm in diameter) acting
as a sieve for drainage from the pleural space. Consequently, as has
been previously observed for carbon nanotubes, the movement of long
fibers is impeded by the size of the stomata, causing them to lodge
in the pleural tissue, where they may exert pathogenic effects over
a long period of time.26 Even when AgNWs
were injected directly into the pleural space, it has been reported
that AgNWs with a length >10 μm may cause frustrated phagocytosis,
while most of the shorter AgNWs (<5 μm) were fully internalized
by pleural macrophage cells, using backscatter electron microscopy.10 Interestingly, AgNWs with lengths of both 5
and 10 μm led to an aggregation of inflammatory cells on the
surface of the parietal pleura with accumulation of AgNWs within the
lesion area, whereas these effects were not seen only for very short
(3 μm) AgNWs.

Although Silva and colleagues12 intratracheally
instilled different doses of AgNWs of longer length than us (2 and
20 μm), there were similarities in terms of the inflammatory
response reported. With the 0.3 mg dose of 1 and 10 μm length
compared to their 0.1 and 0.5 mg doses of the longer AgNWs, the degree
of inflammation was similar. In the histological quantitation of the
lung inflammation, both studies reported a greater persistence of
the inflammation up to day 21 with the S-AgNWs, while there was an
early transient lung inflammatory response with the L-AgNWs. However,
the one main important difference was that we did not observe the
process of frustrated phagocytosis, as reported with the intratracheal
instillation of 20 μm length AgNWs by Silva et al.12 or with the intrapleural instillation
of >10 μm AgNWs.10 The process
of
frustrated phagocytosis has been reported with asbestos fibers which
are less soluble than AgNWs.25 In addition,
the length of our nanowires were limited to a maximal length of 10
μm which can be internalized by single macrophages. More importantly,
AgNWs underwent a significant reduction in length in vivo. Another important difference is that we instilled a lower amount
of AgNWs by weight, using 0.3 mg/kg body weight compared to the amounts
of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg used by Silva and colleagues. Therefore, taken
together with the study of Silva et al.,12 one might hypothesize that the threshold length
of AgNWs for frustrated phagocytosis may be in the region of 10–20
μm with a threshold weight of around 0.3–0.5 mg/kg. However,
these would need to be confirmed in further studies.

Conclusion
We have shown that AgNWs of 1 and 10 μm in length are transformed
into shorter lengths and fully internalized by lung cells such as
macrophages and type II alveolar cells, a process that occurs within
1 day of intratracheal instillation in rats. This underlies the acute
and transient inflammatory, cytokine, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness
in the lungs particularly seen with the long AgNWs, which caused a
greater and longer-lasting degree of lung inflammation with a more
diverse cytokine production and crucially induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
This effect of long AgNWs compared to the short AgNWs is likely due
to the greater number and persistence of macrophages containing silver
in the pleura and lung subpleural spaces. Overall, inactivation of
Ag ions occurs after precipitation of Ag2S intracellularly.
Our results provide information regarding the risks of silver-based
technologies, particularly in the area of nanowires to human health
and to the potential for developing hyperresponsive airways disease
that could include asthma.

Methods/Experimental
Section
Nanomaterials
AgNWs were prepared via a modified polyol pathway, through the reduction of AgNO3 by ethylene glycol (EG, Sigma-Aldrich, U.K.) in the presence of
PVP (MW ≈ 360 K, Sigma-Aldrich,
U.K.), as described by Chen et al.15 The length of the AgNWs was modified by altering the molar
ratio of PVP to AgNO3 from 1.5 to 3.0. AgNWs were washed
by repeated cycles of centrifugation (5000 g) with
acetone, ethanol, and 3 times with deionized (DI) water, dispersed
in DI water in a sealed glass vial, and stored at 4 °C in the
dark. AgNWs were characterized by bright-field transmission electron
microscopy (BF-TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2100F, combined with SAED and
EDX (Oxford Instruments). The primary size distributions of AgNWs
were characterized using several TEM images and ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The hydrodynamic diameter of
AgNWs in water was measured using DLS (Malvern Zetasizer Nano series).

To measure Ag+ ion release from AgNWs, the suspensions
were incubated at a concentration of 25 μg/mL from the original
stock solutions in a temperature-controlled dri-block incubator at
physiological temperature (37 °C) in 0.1 M sodium perchlorate
(NaClO4·H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), with pH 7
or 5, to simulate the characteristic environment in the lung.12 The amount of Ag+ ions released was
measured, following centrifugal filtration,12 by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES,
Thermo Scientific, U.K.) with a silver detection limit of 0.6 μg/L.
Solubility was expressed as the mass percentage of total Ag released
as Ag+ ions.

Intratracheal Instillation in Rats
All in vivo experiments were conducted under a home
office license provided
by the U.K. government. Sprague–Dawley rats, 8–10 weeks
old (250–300 g), were purchased from Charles River (U.K.) and
maintained under a 12 h light and dark cycle, with food and water
provided ad libitum. AgNW (S-AgNW and L-AgNW) suspensions
were water-bath sonicated for 1 min, prior to dilution in DI water.
As we have previously confirmed, the concentration of free Ag+ ions in the AgNW stock solutions was below the ICP-OES detection
limit.14 Intratracheal instillation of
AgNW suspensions (0.3 mL; 0.3 mg/kg, 100 μg/rat) or the control
(distilled water) was performed under isofluorane anesthesia (3 min/3%
isofluorane/3.5% O2) using a ball-tipped needle maneuvered
through the epiglottis, with confirmation by external palpation of
contact with tracheal rings and by inflation of lungs with air. A
0.5 mg/kg dose of AgNWs has been shown to cause a degree of lung inflammation,12 and in order to induce just a minimal degree
of lung inflammation, we chose a dose of 0.3 mg/kg to instil. AgNO3, used as another control, was instilled at 0.003 mg/kg to
model the average concentration of silver ions (1%) released from
AgNWs in pH 7 and 5 perchlorate buffers in 24 h (Table 1).14 After instillation, rats were returned to their cages and examined
at 1, 7, or 21 days.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)
After
lung function measurements,
BAL was performed after an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and cell
differential cell count was obtained on BAL cell cytopin preparations
as previously described.9 Total protein
levels were measured using the Bradford protein assay (Biorad Laboratories,
Hemel Hempsted, U.K.). BAL chemokines and cytokines were measured
using the Milliplex MAP rat cytokine/chemokine panel (Merck-Millipore)
and detected using a Luminex 200 system (Luminex, Austin, TX). MDA
was measured by an HPLC method with fluorescence detection (Waters,
Milford, MA, U.S.A.) as previously described.9

Phospholipid and Surfactant Proteins
BALF contains
pulmonary surfactant (PS) which can be separated by differential centrifugation
into large aggregate (LA) and small aggregate (SA) fractions. The
LA fraction contains SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C, phospholipids, tubular
myelin, lamellar bodies, and large vesicles and has superior surface
active properties compared with the SA fraction.27 Phospholipid was measured in the LA fractions by the method
of Bartlett.28 Briefly, 1 mL of BAL supernatant
was centrifuged at 18,000 g at 4 °C, and the
LA fraction (pellet) was suspended in 40 μL of saline. Total
lipids were extracted from 5 μL of the LA fraction using a Bligh
and Dyer extraction following a perchloric acid digestion for 1 h
at 200 °C. Levels of organic phosphate were measured against
a potassium phosphate standard curve. SP-D was measured in undiluted
whole BAL supernatant using a rat specific ELISA kit following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Cusabio Biotech, Newmarket, Suffolk,
U.K.).

Lung Mechanics
Rats were anaesthetised using hypnorm/hypovel
intraperitoneally (2.7 mg/kg), tracheotomized and ventilated using
a computer controlled ventilator (eSpira, EMMS) at a tidal volume
of 10 mL/kg and a frequency of 90 breaths per minute. Positive end
expiratory pressure (PEEP) was maintained at 5 cm H2O,
and volume history was regulated by three successive inflations to
total lung capacity (30 cm H2O), prior to taking measurements.
Pulmonary function was measured using the forced oscillation technique.
Respiratory impedance was measured following interruption of normal
breathing by an 8 s sinusoidal oscillation containing multiple frequencies
ranging between 0.5 and 20 Hz. Respiratory impedance data were fitted
to the constant phase model, which partitions impedance signals into
those originating in the large airway (Rn, large airway resistance)
and the small airways and tissues (G, tissue resistance
and H, tissue elastance).29 Similar changes in G and H reflect
collapse of the small airways, while dissimilar changes describe heterogeneity
in airway ventilation.30 Measurements were
recorded at baseline and also following nebulization of 20 μL
of increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
and 64 mg/mL).

Lung Inflammation and Silver-Stained Lung
Cells
The
left lung was embedded into paraffin, and 5 μm sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (BDH Lutterworth, U.K.). The inflammation
was scored on a 0–3 scale as previously described.9 Deposition of silver in lung tissue sections
was performed by autometallography using a silver enhancing Kit (cat
no: SE100, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, U.S.A.) as previously described,
with the use of silver-enhancing solutions and fixation with sodium
thiosulfate, followed by nuclear fast red counterstain.9 AgNWs were visualized under light microscopy.
The Ag+ cells were counted on 20 fields across the whole
section of left lung, excluding the subpleural areas. The Ag+ cells deposited in pleural region including the subpleural alveoli
were counted in 20-half-fields along the 200 μm distance from
the pleura of the left lung.

TEM and 3D SEM Imaging of Silver Nanowires
in Lung and BAL Cells
Rats were exposed by intratracheal
instillation to 0.5 mg/kg of
AgNWs in a 0.5 mL volume as previously described. Rats were returned
to their cages for either 2 or 24 h. Rats were sacrificed by an overdose
of sodium pentobarbital, and the lungs were immediately perfused with
2 × 60 mL of saline via the vasculature, followed
by perfusion with fixative (2% formaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1
M PIPES buffer, containing 2 mmol/L calcium chloride). Lungs were
removed and fixed overnight, before rinsing with and then storing
in normal saline. BAL cells were rinsed in physiological saline, and
cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1
M Pipes buffer, pH 7.2. After fixation, cells and tissues were washed
5 times in saline and dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol
solutions to 100% dry ethanol. They were stained in 4% magnesium uranyl
acetate in 100% ethanol for 48 h, rinsed 4 times in 100% dry ethanol,
and infiltrated with Quetol 651 epoxy resin over 4 days. Quetol was
cured at 65 °C for a minimum of 48 h.13 In previous work, we have shown that this preparation procedure
for electron microscopy does not alter the physicochemistry of the
AgNWs.21 For TEM and serial block face
SEM, small pieces of tissues embedded in Quetol were glued to aluminum
pins with CW2400 conductive epoxy resin (ITW Chemtronics). They were
sputter coated with 100 nm of gold in a Quorum K575X and transferred
to a Leica ultracut UCT where a flat surface was generated using a
35° wedge angle Diatome diamond knife. The block face was 1.5
× 1.5 μm. Subsequent to thin sectioning, the blocks were
retrieved and coated with carbon and preselected for serial block
face imaging in a FEI Verios 460 operated at 3 keV and 50pA using
a concentric backscatter detector. For electron microscopy imaging
and analysis, the lungs of two rats were studied for both the S- and
L-AgNWs. For each animal, three lobes of each lung were analyzed.

For TEM analysis, sections of fixed and embedded cells were cut with
an ultramicrotome using a 35° wedge angle diamond knife and floated
on distilled water. Sections were immediately collected on uncoated
300 mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific, Stansted, U.K.) and dried
for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections of 70–100 nm thickness were
used for imaging studies. The block face was used for serial 3D imaging.

3D SEM Images of Silver Nanowires in Lung and BAL Cells
For serial block face SEM, serial sections were generated in a FEI
Quanta 250 FEG-environmental (E-)SEM using an in situ ultramicrotome (Gatan, 3View). The individual images were acquired
at an electron beam voltage of 3.5 keV using a backscattered electron
detector in low-vacuum mode at 90 Pa. The nominal thickness of the
individual slices was 40 nm, and the image sizes were 40 × 40
μm. The 3D reconstruction was generated from 300 slices and
pixel size of 19.2 × 19.2 nm. The 3D reconstruction was performed
using Gatan Digital Micrograph software and also Bitplane Imaris 3D
reconstruction software.

Acquisition of TEM Images of Silver Nanowires
in Lung and BAL
Cells
Bright-field TEM imaging was performed on a JEOL 2000
microscope operated at 80 kV and an FEI Titan 80-300 scanning/transmission
electron microscope (S/TEM) operated at 80 kV, fitted with Cs (image)
corrector and SiLi EDX spectrometer (EDAX, Leicester U.K.). High-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
experiments were performed with a convergence semiangle of 14 mrad
and inner and outer HAADF collection angles of 49 and 239 mrad, respectively.
The probe diameter was <0.5 nm. The intensity of the signal, using
the HAADF detector is proportional Z2 of the material being
analyzed, therefore this detector was used to enhance contrast from
the AgNWs and heavy metal-stained cell organelles.

Processing
and Quantification of 3D SEM Data Sets
Data
sets acquired by serial block face SEM imaging were visualized in
AvizoLite (v9.0.1, FEI, U.S.A.), and cells containing nanowires were
segmented by intensity-based thresholding. A smoothing algorithm (3D
mean) was applied using ImageJ (v1.48) prior to a semiautomated procedure
used to segment individual AgNWs. The identification of separate nanowires
was then carried out using a binary watershed applied using QuiQ 3D
(IQM Elements, London, U.K.), followed by manual inspection and final
adjustment of the segmentation results using Avizo (9.01, FEI, U.S.A.).
Advanced quantification was performed using QuiQ 3D. The feret diameters
were determined through a hypersphere to fit the nanowires and calculate
nanowire length.20 Incompletely described
particles or nanowires (i.e., those
that extend out of the field of view captured using 3D SEM) were removed
leaving a total of 116 completely described nanowires, contained within
two cells, to be quantified.

Statistical Analysis
Data were assessed for normality
using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Comparison of the means of nonparametric
data at the three time points was performed by an ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis
test) with the differences between individual groups assessed by the
Dunns posthoc test. Due to the non-normal distributions of AgNW lengths,
the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to compare
the similarity of AgNWs lengths before and after internalization in
epithelial cells. Differences in lung function for AgNW treatments
compared with the distilled water control were assessed using a two-way
ANOVA with a Bonferroni posthoc test to assess differences between
individual concentrations. A p value of <5% was
taken as significant.
