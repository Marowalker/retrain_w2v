==== Body
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common viral cause of congenital infection and the leading non‐genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Following maternal infection, vertical transmission via the placenta can occur at any stage of pregnancy; however, transmission is most prevalent in the third trimester. Yet the risk of serious fetal sequelae is highest after transmission during the first trimester, and more so in cases of primary maternal infection.

Ultrasound findings suggestive of cCMV include isolated cerebral abnormality and/or at least one extracerebral abnormality and/or fetal blood abnormalities (viraemia >3000 copies/ml; platelet count <100 000/mm3).

According to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Scientific Impact Paper No. 56) and The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Practice Bulletin No. 151), universal screening is not feasible; however, in the presence of ultrasound abnormalities following maternal infection, amniocentesis should be considered for viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at least 8 weeks after presumed maternal primary infection. In cases of fetal infection, neuroimaging via fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhances the detection rate of cerebral abnormalities in addition to ultrasound scans (USs). In cases of normal US and MRI findings, fetal outcome has been considered as favourable (Lipitz et  al. Ultrasound Obst Gyn 2010;36:709–17).

In this issue, Bardon et  al. (BJOG 2019; https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.15935) report on the value of prenatal assessment of fetuses affected by cCMV before 14 weeks of gestation following maternal primary infection in terms of peri‐ and postnatal outcome up to 4 years of age. Prenatal diagnosis of cCMV was made by amniocentesis and fetal platelet count (FPC) was assessed. US was performed in the second trimester, up to 28 weeks of gestation, followed by fetal MRI before 32 weeks of gestation and further US in the third trimester. US findings by 28 weeks of gestation were grouped into: (1) normal scan and FPC; (2) extracerebral finding and/or FPC ≤114 000/mm3; and (3) cerebral findings regardless of FPC. Based upon clinical symptoms at birth and up to 4 years of age, the risk assessment was recalculated after consideration of findings from fetal MRI at 32 weeks of gestation and after third‐trimester US. One of the important findings was that the negative predictive value for the risk of moderate to severe fetal sequelae was 100% in cases where both second‐trimester US and fetal MRI were normal. High false‐positive rates most frequently arose from white matter hypersignals.

This study highlights the importance of the serial assessment of fetuses with cCMV in order to predict neonatal outcome by fetal US and fetal MRI. Some factors must be acknowledged before implementing good prediction models into clinical care, however. Routine maternal antenatal screening of CMV infection is not generally carried out and screening in the late first trimester has a risk of underdiagnosing up to 30% of early maternal primary infections (Revello et  al. Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 2012;31:3331–9). Furthermore, in many countries access to fetal MRI is limited, and adequate radiology training in detecting and interpreting cCMV‐associated cerebral lesions is necessary. After all, it remains a clinical challenge to accurately predict prognosis early enough in all fetuses affected by CMV, especially in cases where fetal treatment is to be provided or termination of pregnancy has been considered by parents.
