Most recently ORF 3a of SARS-CoV has been identified as a 274 amino acid membrane protein of human severe acute respiratory syndrome corona (SARS-Co) virus. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes the protein forms channels. Based on bioinformatics approaches the topology has been identified to include three transmembrane domains (TMDs).

Since structural models from experiments are still lacking, computational methods can be challenged to generate such models. In this study, we select a 'sequential approach’for the assembly protocol in which the individual TMDs are assembled one by one. This approach is seen to mimic in vivo expression of the protein. The role of different force fields on the assembly and the dielectric of the lipid bilayer are evaluated. Also the role of the loops between TMDs is investigated. Potential models and pore lining motifs will be shown. MD simulations for 20 ns are performed to assess the bundle stability in a lipid environment. The MD results show that the pore lining motif of the bundle is due to residues from TM2 which generate apore full of water molecules supporting the finding of 3a as an ion channel.
