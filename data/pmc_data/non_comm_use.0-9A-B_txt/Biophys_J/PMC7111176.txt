Membrane proteins perform a multitude of tasks in a viral lifecycle. Fusion glycoproteins are specialized membrane-anchored biological machines that play critical roles in viral entry and infection. The membrane fusion mediated by SARS glycoprotein requires an orchestrated participation of functionally relevant domains such as the fusion peptide (FP) and the transmembrane domain (TM). Interaction of these segments with membranes drives large conformational changes in the viral glycoprotein that ultimately lead to the merge of the virus envelope with the cell membrane. Although a wealth of data of class I FPs and TMs, such as those from influenza and HIV viruses, has been obtained in recent years, high-resolution structural information of fusion peptides and transmembrane domains from coronaviruses is surprisingly scarce. The SARS-like respiratory illness caused by the MERS coronavirus highlights the need for further studies of functional FP and TM domains. Due to their sequence conservation among coronaviruses, they provide new targets for drug development. Other classes of viral membrane proteins, such as the viroporins Vpu from HIV-1 and p7 from HCV, have also been regarded as drug targets. Viroporins are small, hydrophobic proteins that can oligomerize in membranes and induce channel or pore activity. Here we report recent progress on the determination of high-resolution NMR structures of the SARS membrane-active domains as well as viroporins reconstituted in detergent micelles, isotropic bicelles, lipid nanodiscs, and in the more physiologically-relevant phospholipid bilayer environment. All of these proteins adopt primarily α-helical structures in membrane environments.
