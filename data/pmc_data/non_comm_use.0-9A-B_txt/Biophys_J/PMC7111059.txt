==== Body
SARS was epidemic in 2003 worldwide. SARS-CoV helicase plays critical roles in viral replication, and has been proposed to be a potential candidate for anti-SARS therapy. We use single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to examine the unwinding and rewinding mechanism of nsP13 helicase on partial DNA duplexes as a function of protein, ATP concentration, and tail length. Our results reveal that the tail length of the substrates determines the total amount of DNA unwound by increasing the number of proteins loaded. In contrast, unwinding rate and step size increase as a function of the protein and ATP concentration for the partial duplex with a long tail (45nts long), but independent of protein concentration for the short tail (30nts long). We also observed a repetitive unwinding displaying multiple rounds of re-unwinding and re-zipping events where re-unwinding becomes favorable at higher protein concentration. We also found that the relative extent of constitutive unwinding and repetitive fluctuation is defined by the modality of DNA-Protein complex in the presence or absence of ATP concentration. The ratio between them determines the processivity of the cooperative helicases in tandem. In general, our results identify the important cellular parameters, governing the cooperative unwinding and repetitive rewinding behavior of helicase. This is a new attempt to understand the complicate behavior of unwinding motor cohorts at the single molecule resolution.
