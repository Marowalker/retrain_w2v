==== Body
Members of the Coronaviridae family are enveloped viruses causing in humans from common colds to acute respiratory syndrome and, in animals, a variety of lethal diseases of economical relevance. The envelope (E) protein from coronaviruses (CoVs) is a small polypeptide that modulates coronavirus morphogenesis, tropism and virulence [1]. SARS-CoV E protein forms an amphipatic alpha-helix that expands the viral membrane once and displays the amino-terminus to the virus surface and the carboxy-terminus inside of the viral particle. In vitro studies have shown that synthetic coronavirus envelope proteins oligomerize forming pentameric structures with ion channel activity [2].

We have evaluated the ion channel activity of several synthetic peptides derived from the transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E E proteins by using planar bilayer electrophysiology of peptide oligomers in DPhPC membranes. The conditions under which some of these peptides form ion channels and their properties at the single channel level were determined. The ion channel activity of a collection of SARS-CoV E protein transmembrane domain derived peptides with point mutations showed that specific residues, mapping at the internal side of the pore, abolished the conductivity. The conductance of the wild type SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E E protein derived peptides was studied under different salt concentrations. At 1M solutions of monovalent ion concentration conductance was lower than 1 nS, suggesting that these peptides form relatively large channels. In contrast to previously published data, selectivity measurements did not show a marked preference between cations and anions in our system. Possible causes of this divergence will be analyzed.
