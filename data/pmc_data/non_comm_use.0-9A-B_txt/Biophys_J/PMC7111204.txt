==== Body
The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein from SARS coronavirus (CoV) contains internal membranotropic domains that play important roles to the viral and host cell membrane fusion. These functional domains, which include a so-called fusion peptide (FP) and an internal FP, are exposed to membrane interactions upon a specific trigger. Although membrane fusion has been broadly studied in recent years, many aspects of the molecular mechanism behind the virus-host cell membrane fusion remain unknown, including conformational changes of the lipid bilayers during peptide-membrane interactions. Here we employed spin-labeling Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), 31P oriented sample solid state (OSSS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to address these questions of fusion peptide - membrane interactions from the membrane perspective. DSC results showed that the peptides strongly perturb the thermotropic behavior of zwitterionic and negatively-charged lipid vesicles, with the largest effects seen for the latter. Not only the charge but also the lipid headgroup structure seems to be relevant for the energetics of the interaction. ESR showed that both peptides were capable of increasing lipid packing and head group ordering only in the presence of negatively charged lipids, which was further corroborated by NMR on aligned lipids deposited into nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide substrates. The observed effects are well correlated to those caused by well-known membrane fusion promoters and are in contrast to those promoted by membrane fusion inhibitors. The combined effect of an increased chain-packing energy, which induces bending moment in the bilayer, and membrane surface ordering, which is related to lipid dehydration, might promote negative curvature for negatively charged lipid-containing membranes, thus, helping to overcome the high kinetic barrier of the membrane fusion.
