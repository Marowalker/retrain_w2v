                    receptors in signal transduction make use of rate-equilibrium free-energy
                    relationships (REFERs), previously applied to chemical reactions, enzyme
                    kinetics, and protein folding. For oligomeric membrane receptors, we distinguish
                    between a), the Leffler parameter αL, to
                    characterize the global transition state for the interconversion between
                    conformations; and b), the Fersht parameter,
                        ϕF, to assign the degree of progression
                    of individual residue positions at the transition state. For both
                        αL and
                        ϕF, insights are achieved by using
                    harmonic energy profiles to reflect the dynamic nature of proteins, as
                    illustrated with single-channel results reported for normal and mutant nicotinic
                    receptors. We also describe new applications of
                        αL based on published results. For
                    large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, data are satisfactorily
                    fit with an αL value of 0.65, in accord with
                    REFERs. In contrast, results reported for the flip conformational state of
                    glycine and nicotinic receptors are in disaccord with REFERs, since they yield
                        αL values outside the usual
                    limits of 0–1. Concerning published
                        ϕF values underlying the conformational
                    wave hypothesis for nicotinic receptors, we note that interpretations may be
                    complicated by variations in the width of harmonic energy profiles.

Introduction
Rate-equilibrium free-energy relationships (REFERs) date principally from early
                insights of Brønsted et al. (1–3). For any chemical reaction involving
                reactants (B) and products (A), the ratio of the forward and backward rate constants
                    (BAk and ABk,
                respectively) fixes the value of the equilibrium constant,
                    Keq =
                    BAk/ABk. Hence, changes
                in reaction conditions or the structures that alter Keq
                must be reflected by corresponding changes in BAk and/or
                    ABk. REFERs interpret the changes based on the
                nature of the transition state (TS). For a TS more closely resembling A than B,
                perturbations that change Keq should be reflected by
                greater changes in BAk than
                    ABk, because the perturbation alters the TS and A to
                a similar degree, leaving ABk largely unchanged, whereas
                the effect on B is different, leading to a greater change in
                    BAk. Quantitatively, the TS is positioned on a
                hypothetical reaction coordinate, r‡, between 0
                (fully B-like) and 1 (fully A-like).

REFERs are based on the assumption that the TS position estimated from the slope of a
                plot of ΔG‡ (activation energy) versus
                    ΔGo (reaction equilibrium), reflects the
                position on r‡. This slope,
                    ∂ΔG‡/∂ΔGo,
                had generally been designated by the Brønsted β, or
                the Leffler α (here designated
                    αL), or more recently by the Fersht
                    ϕ (here designated
                    ϕF). For oligomeric proteins, it is
                important to distinguish between αL to
                characterize the global TS for interconversions between conformational states and
                    ϕF to characterize the progression of
                particular residue positions at the TS. Each ligand molecule bound successively to
                equivalent sites of a homooligomeric protein will exert a similar effect on the
                conformational equilibrium by changing either forward or backward rate constants (or
                a combination of both), as indicated by the αL
                value (4). In contrast,
                    ϕF values, as originally applied to protein
                folding using mutational analysis at specific positions, indicate the degree of
                advancement of a particular residue at the TS (5,6). Hence, a residue with ϕF
                > 0.5 is characterized as early, since it has advanced >50% of its
                trajectory toward the final state, whereas global conformational change with
                    αL > 0.5 is characterized as late
                    (7), since the TS is more productlike
                than reactantlike. To maintain these distinctions, we employ here both
                    αL and
                    ϕF.

REFERs have been applied to numerous classes of chemical reactions, including
                enzyme-catalyzed reaction, although residues directly in catalysis can produce
                irregular results (8), and protein folding
                    (9). Interestingly, the formalism used
                in the analysis of the folding transitions can be applied to transitions of
                receptors from closed to open ion channels. Examples from protein folding can also
                clarify ϕF values <0 or >1
                    (10,11), as well as inconsistent
                results for changes at neighboring positions along an
                α-helix (12).
                Insights into the implications of changes in the shape of energy profiles, as
                further developed in this article, can be useful (6).

Applications of REFERs to oligomeric proteins began with hemoglobin (7,13) and were then applied, using
                    αL analysis, to characterize the rate
                changes for conformational interconversions as a function of agonist binding for
                normal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (4) and a myasthenic mutant (14). These applications were followed by an approach using
                    ϕF analysis to characterize point mutations
                for nAChR in various regions of the nAChR molecule (15). Using the latter approach, researchers have produced
                novel results by introducing multiple replacements at the same residue position
                    (16,17), with marked variations
                in ϕF for different domains interpreted in terms
                of a hypothetical conformational wave (15).
                However, difficulties in interpretation are raised, notably for neighboring residues
                with markedly different ϕF values in the
                channel-lining M2 α-helix (17).

In this review, we develop distinctions between
                    αL and
                    ϕF and explore other applications, initially
                using examples from nAChR presented in terms of free energy to use a linear scale
                that facilitates visualization. Indeed, REFERs are also commonly named linear
                free-energy relations (15,18). We
                also examine harmonic energy profiles to represent the dynamic nature of protein
                conformations. Data from the literature are then examined to evaluate REFERs as
                criteria for kinetic models. Results for large-conductance, calcium-activated
                potassium channels (19) fit well to REFERs,
                but results for glycine and nicotinic receptors interpreted in terms of a novel flip
                state (20) are inconsistent with REFERs.
                Finally, the conformational wave hypothesis (15) for nAChR is critically examined based on distinctions between
                    αL and
                    ϕF, and general conclusions are drawn.

Global TS characterization with αL
                    values
For oligomeric proteins with more than one conformational state, the
                    Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model (21)
                    provides a minimal functional description involving a preexisting equilibrium
                    for the concerted transition between two states, designated T (constrained) and
                    R (relaxed), with the assignment of R to the high-affinity, active state, as
                    applied initially to allosteric enzymes and hemoglobin (21–23). However, for
                    membrane receptors, confusion arises due to the practice of assigning R to the
                    low-affinity, inactive resting state for receptors. Therefore, we adopted the
                    terms basal (B) and active (A) in place of T and R, for the closed and
                    open states, respectively, in the applications to ligand-gated channels (4), and these B and A designations are
                    maintained here.

When A binds a ligand more strongly than B, a shift in the B-A equilibrium in
                    favor of A with each ligand-binding event results from an increase in the
                    B→A rate or a decrease in the A→B rate, or both. In early
                    studies, without invoking REFERs, A→B rates were interpreted as
                    progressively falling with ligand binding, both for an allosteric dehydrogenase,
                    for which B→A rates were assumed to remain constant (24), and for hemoglobin, for which falling
                    A→B rates were partially offset by increasing B→A rates (25). Subsequently, using REFERs for
                    hemoglobin, the A→B rates were shown to decrease systematically with
                    ligand binding, corresponding to αL = 0.8
                        (13).

For the MWC model, each ligand-binding reaction is assumed to displace the
                    equilibrium between the B and A states by BAc (21,26), the ratio of the ligand
                    dissociation constants for the two states, KA and
                        KB, such that BAc =
                        KA/KB < 1
                    for KA < KB.
                    When expressed in terms of αL, changes in
                    the interconversion rate constants upon binding of the ith
                    ligand molecule are fixed by (4) (1) ki
                                −
                                1BA / kiBA =
                                    (cBA)αL
                                and
                                    kiAB / ki
                                − 1AB = (cBA)(1 −
                                        αL). Hence,
                    for αL = 1, upon removal of the
                        ith ligand, the B→A rate decreases by
                    BAc, with the A→B rates unchanged. In contrast, for
                        αL = 0, upon addition of the
                        ith ligand, the A→B rate decreases by
                    BAc, with the B→A rates unchanged. For values of 0 >
                        αL > 1, the exact rates are
                    given by Eq. 1.

In general, rate effects are more readily visualized on a linear scale of
                    energies. Changes in the activation energy of the transition state,
                        ΔΔG‡, with respect to
                    changes in the free energies of ligand binding to the two states,
                        ΔGA and
                        ΔGB, are given by (4) (2) ΔΔG‡ =
                                    αLΔGA
                                + (1 −
                                    αL)ΔGB. The
                    diagram in Fig. 1
                    A illustrates the dependence of
                        ΔΔG‡ on
                        ΔGA and
                        ΔGB as a function of
                        αL. The B and A states are represented
                    by energy ladders, with each rung set by the number of bound ligands (0, 1, or
                    2). Interconversion rates indicated by the TS heights also form a ladder, and
                    the αL value is directly related to the
                    spacing of the TS rungs. For example, TS spacing equivalent to that of the B
                    state corresponds to αL = 0, whereas spacing
                    equivalent to the A state corresponds to αL
                    = 1. In Fig. 1
                    A, the TS spacing is given by Eq. 2, with
                        αL = 0.8.

To deduce the value of αL in Fig. 1
                    A, for nAChR, REFERs were first applied to nAChR from
                        Torpedo (4), a heteropentamer with a subunit composition of
                        α2βγδ,
                    where each α subunit contributes the principal
                    component of the ligand-binding sites at an interface with either a
                        γ- or δ-subunit (27). Rates of channel opening and closing
                    were deduced from single-channel data for diliganded receptors and monoliganded
                    receptors from brief openings (28).
                    With this information, the system is sufficiently defined to permit
                    extrapolation to opening frequencies and lifetimes of unliganded receptors,
                    regarding which data are very sparse (29). In this way, αL = 0.8 was
                    obtained for Torpedo muscle nAChR (4) and subsequently applied to data from human muscle
                    receptors (14), as summarized in Fig. 1
                    A. The B and A states, corresponding to closed and open
                    channels, respectively, can be considered to represent discrete structures, as
                    would in principle be observed by x-ray crystallography (30,31).

Adopting a simple TS, as in Fig. 1, provides a minimal representation, although more complex
                    TS profiles for nAChR are possible (32–34). In addition, changes in the
                    rate-constant prefactor could also play a role. Moreover, proteins are more
                    accurately characterized as dynamic structures (35,36), with population distributions of
                    conformational states that may be shifted by bound ligands (37). To provide a simplified view with dynamic
                    representation, the discrete energy levels of Fig. 1
                    A were replaced in Fig. 1
                    B by harmonic parabolic profiles (38), as might be produced by normal-mode analysis
                    based on elastic network models (39–43), along the lines adopted for protein
                    folding (6). We assume that the dynamics
                    can be described with a simple mathematical expression to illustrate the basic
                    principles, whereas more complex properties could be encountered. The six minima
                    of the parabolic profiles in Fig. 1
                    B are fixed to correspond exactly to the energy levels in Fig. 1
                    A. In addition, the parabolic profiles are placed to intersect
                    at energy levels corresponding exactly to the TS barriers in Fig. 1
                    A. For any pair of profiles, when the energy level of the
                    product (Fig. 1,
                        right) is lowered, the intersection point moves slightly to
                    the left, which is known as the Hammond effect (44).

Although REFERs are based on the hypothesis that the reaction coordinate
                        r‡ is directly related to the
                        αL value, the parabolic profiles suggest
                    that a range of r‡ values apply. Moreover,
                    to achieve agreement between the profiles in Fig. 1, A and B, the
                    steepness of the profiles in Fig. 1
                    B was adjusted, since shifting only the profile heights
                    produces insufficiently large changes in the intersection points, yielding
                    differences in successive opening rates of only ∼50% of the values in
                        Fig. 1
                    A. As illustrated in Fig. 1
                    C, the minima for each of the profiles corresponding to the
                    same energy levels as in Fig. 1
                    B but with no change in profile shape, give intersection points
                    that are higher or lower for the diliganded or unliganded states, respectively.
                    This implies that a small progressive broadening of the profiles for both the
                    closed and open states accompanies ligand binding. The origin of such changes in
                    dynamics is unclear, but some clues are provided by the simulations of
                    diphosphoglycerate binding to hemoglobin (37). Overall, the application of
                        αL may require adjustments for more
                    precise data, but the principle of changes uniformly distributed between forward
                    and backward rates is a reliable framework. Complexities in the system have been
                    kept to a minimum here to highlight the general principles of Eq. 2 to provide guidelines for the examples
                    considered in the following sections.

Applications of global TS characterization to mutant phenotypes
An important application of REFERs for nAChR concerns modifications of specific
                    residues, either by site-directed mutations or by naturally occurring myasthenic
                    mutations in the human population, which lead to major changes in functional
                    properties in terms of both gain of function (45,46) and loss of function (27,47). With the MWC model, we can distinguish
                    between K-phenotypes, which affect ligand binding sites, and L-phenotypes, which
                    alter the equilibrium between states (48). The first abnormal nAChR studied using REFERs was a
                    gain-of-function mutation myasthenic syndrome, ɛT246P
                        (ɛ replaces γ in human
                    adults), which exhibits three peaks in open-time distributions compared to the
                    single peak observed for normal nAChR (49). These initially perplexing properties were represented by
                    lowering the values of the allosteric constant, L, from
                        108 to 102 and of
                        αL from 0.8 to 0.55 (14), as presented in Fig. 1
                    D as a static energy diagram. Although it reproduces three
                    peaks of open times (14), the general
                    agreement does not necessarily qualify as a perfect fit (50), but demonstrates how changes in basic parameters
                    of the model could provide a general understanding of this unusual phenotype.
                    More extensive data could alter the quantitative features, but showing how open
                    times can be transformed from a unimodal to a trimodal distribution illustrates
                    an important principle, and a description using harmonic profiles is presented
                    in Fig. 1
                    E.

Compared to the properties of normal nAChR in Fig. 1
                    A, the mutant receptors are characterized by a more stable A
                    state and lower kinetic barriers and αL. For
                    comparison, Fig. 1
                    F presents harmonic profiles using the values from Fig. 1
                    B, but with only the energy levels for the A state at lower
                    values, to correspond to the decrease in the allosteric constant from
                        L = 109 to 102. In this case, an
                    appropriate intersection for diliganded states is maintained, but for the
                    monoliganded and unliganded states, intersection points correspond to TS values
                    significantly above the values used to model the experimental data. Therefore,
                    the mutant results cannot be represented satisfactorily without changing the
                    steepness of harmonic profiles, as well as the levels of their minima, resulting
                    in the shift of αL from 0.8 to 0.55.
                    Overall, the analysis of the ɛT246P nAChR receptors
                    clearly illustrates how changes in the relative stability of conformational
                    states, coupled with small changes in TS position, can produce striking
                    differences in properties.

Tests of global TS characterization
Critical evaluations are possible using data obtained independently of REFERs
                    that can subsequently be used to test the validity of
                        αL values. For example, for
                    large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, Cox et al.
                        (19) measured kinetic rate
                    constants with 0–4 calcium ions bound. As shown in Fig. 2, these data are well-fit by REFERs with
                        αL = 0.65 to represent the increasing
                    opening rates and decreasing closing rates as a function of bound
                    calcium. Data that permit clear testing are rare, but were also available for
                    hemoglobin due to the spectral signatures for the T and R states, which
                    make it easier to follow conformational changes upon photodissociation of carbon
                    monoxide or oxygen (13), and the
                    appropriate αL could then be used in the
                    complete description of ligand-binding kinetics for hemoglobin (51). In comparison, earlier data analyses
                    for hemoglobin without αL usually produced
                    inconsistent relationships between rate constants (52). Taken together, these applications to
                    large-conductance potassium channels and hemoglobin illustrate that REFERs can
                    provide coherence to mechanistic models.

An extensive data set for glycine receptors (GlyR) and nAChR presented by Lape
                    et al. (20) also provides an
                    excellent opportunity to examine consistency with respect to REFERs, as analyzed
                    here in detail, since these studies illustrate several relevant phenomena. The
                    authors interpret their data in terms of a third state, flip (F), which
                    intervenes between the closed (B) and open (A) states. Reduced access to F (but
                    not to A) was proposed to explain partial agonism (20). However, these data display an unusual feature.
                    In contrast to the standard pattern (Figs.
                        1 and 2), with forward and backward reactions showing opposite
                    dependence on ligand binding, the rate constants for activation of GlyR show
                    marked deceleration (by >2 orders of magnitude) of both forward and
                    backward rates for the B→F transition upon binding a third molecule of
                    the partial agonist taurine (Fig. 3
                    A), corresponding to αL =
                    −13.1 (Fig. 3
                    B), well outside the usual limits of 0–1. Moreover,
                    large acceleration (>1 order of magnitude) was reported for both forward
                    and backward rates of the F→A transition (Fig. 3
                    A), corresponding to a value of
                        αL = 1.68 with taurine as the ligand
                        (Fig. 3
                    B) or αL = 4.7 with glycine
                    as the ligand (data not shown). In a similar way, for nAChR in the same study
                        (20), rate constants correspond to
                        αL values outside the usual 0–1
                    limits, with αL = −3.9 for formation
                    of F from B upon binding acetylcholine and
                        αL = 1.24 for formation of A from F upon
                    binding of the partial agonist tetramethylammonium at −80 mV. These
                    results raise questions regarding the exceptional nature of these
                        αL values.

For both GlyR and nAChR, better fits were reported when the mechanisms did not
                    include direct ligand-binding reactions between open states (20). If the open states are not connected, partially
                    liganded receptors can only add another ligand by returning to the flip state,
                    which is surprising behavior for a multisite receptor (53), although specific ion effects cannot be excluded
                        (54), as suggested for certain
                    cases (55–59), with general applications to nonequilibrium
                    phenomena also considered (60). Another
                    issue involves the unusually high rate for the F→B reaction of GlyR with
                    two molecules of taurine bound: γ2 = 739,000
                        s−1. Overall, the αL
                    values outside the limits of 0 and 1 for the postulated B→F and
                    F→A transitions, and the exceptionally fast
                        γ2 rate constant, elicit concerns about
                    the mechanism proposed and raise the question of whether alternative mechanisms
                    might apply (61). Whatever the outcome
                    in future studies of these receptors, REFERS should provide powerful criteria
                    for evaluation of the mechanisms involved.

Residue progression at the TS probed with mutational analysis
An original and ambitious approach has been developed by Grosman and Auerbach and
                    their colleagues for nAChR, focused initially on using diliganded receptors to
                    investigate the role of individual residues in the kinetics and equilibria
                    of the closed→open transition (15–17,62). At
                    various positions, ϕF values were obtained
                    and used to interpret early and late changes. Since specific nAChR domains were
                    ordered along an early-to-late scale, a novel interpretation was formulated of a
                    conformational wave for the closed→open transition, beginning in the
                    ligand-binding domain, where ϕF values
                    approach 0.9, and continuing with a gradient of decreasing
                        ϕF values to the ion channel, with
                    values <0.3 (17).

Although this hypothesis provides a possible visualization of the conformational
                    transition, an alternative scenario is that specific regions of the molecule
                    could be characterized by different harmonic energy profiles. For example, along
                    the M2 α-helix of the nAChR,
                    α-subunit ϕF values
                    for neighboring residues vary considerably, with
                        ϕF = 0.63 for L250, but 0.26 for L251
                        (17), with similar values for the
                        ɛ-subunit (63). Residues near the M2 C-terminal cap of the
                        α-subunit also deviate from the pattern expected
                    for a conformational wave, with ϕF reaching
                    0.9 (64).

The ϕF variations along M2 complicate
                    explanations, since positions within a domain can show differences in
                        ϕF of similar magnitude to those between
                    domains, and may reflect principally the position on the transmembrane helix, as
                    suggested by the fact that L251, the residue with the lowest
                        ϕF value, is aligned with T254 on the
                    next turn (ϕF = 0.35) on the surface
                    of the helix facing the channel (30,31,65). This orientation may lead to a widening of the harmonic
                    energy profile for the open state that produces lower
                        ϕF values irrespective of a
                    conformational wave, but this hypothesis implies rather homogenous behavior for
                    all amino acid replacement residues tested at these positions (34)—with the exception of outliers, such as
                    I254 (17). Although the channel
                    environment may present unusual features, position-specific effects along
                    helices have also been observed for nonchannel proteins, and for the energy
                    profile, the possibility of asymmetric harmonic wells (6) could add additional complexity to this issue.
                    Multiple shallow wells could further complicate the analysis (32), and possible speed limits for conformational
                    isomerizations may have an impact on results (66). At this stage, conflicting arguments must be weighed concerning
                    the validity of the conformational wave hypothesis.

A distinct REFER application was reported by Grosman, Auerbach, and colleagues
                    involving the conformational transitions of unliganded nAChR (16,67), which previously had been
                    out of reach. The results were reported as
                        ϕF values, but they correspond to
                        αL values according to the distinctions
                    presented here, with the reported value of
                        αL ≅ 0.9 somewhat higher than,
                    but consistent with, that of αL = 0.8
                    reported previously (4), since higher
                        r‡ values can be expected for unliganded
                    nAChR compared to diliganded nAChR (Fig. 1 B). The importance of
                    distinguishing between αL and
                        ϕF is emphasized by the fact that
                        ϕF for any residue position occurs
                    within the context of the global TS characterized by
                        αL. Although precise values of
                        αL may vary somewhat depending on the
                    experimental approach used, a consensus has emerged that the conformational TS
                    of nAChRs strongly resembles the open state, with
                        αL ∼ 0.8.

General Considerations
For the applications reviewed here, REFERs are useful concepts for both wild-type and
                mutant oligomeric receptors. Global TS characterizations using
                    αL provide criteria for evaluating
                mechanistic models, since changes in conformational transition rates upon ligand
                binding that deviate from REFERS (values outside the limits of 0–1) can be
                subjected to added scrutiny. The use of ϕF
                values can also provide useful insights, although interpretations may be complicated
                by changes in harmonic profile steepness (6). In protein folding, the conformations of the unfolded and folded states
                are very different, and distinct domains can be readily characterized, although
                folding may involve competition between different folding pathways, with cooperative
                effects that can be influenced by changes in single residues (68). For ligand-gated channels, the transitions are more
                subtle, as illustrated by recent structural studies of bacterial homologs of
                nicotinic receptors (30,31). For
                these systems, ϕF values for individual residues
                may reflect predominantly local stability differences that alter harmonic energy
                profiles rather than timing at the TS.

Applications of REFERs to other oligomeric proteins provide additional useful
                insights. In a novel application of REFERs, an abrupt ATP-dependent pathway switch
                was identified for the chaperonin GroEL (69). For the allosteric transition of calmodulin (70), free-energy profiles along the transition route
                provided new insights into the underlying conformational dynamics (71). Tetrameric glutamate or cyclic nucleotide receptors
                should also be studied with respect to REFERs. Because of the symmetry mismatch
                between the extracellular and membrane domains in this family (72), additional functional complexity may be expected, as
                for binding of a fluorescent cGMP analog to homotetrameric CNGA2 receptors with
                steps of both positive and negative cooperativity (73). For G-protein-coupled receptors, the availability of
                high-resolution structures (74) provides
                opportunities for studies on conformational dynamics (75,76) and allosteric interactions (77).

These subjects emerge in the context of broader considerations of energy landscapes
                underlying protein function at all levels (78–80), including distinct time regimes (81). For ligand-gated channels, as shown
                here, the classical view of open-channel lifetimes from single-molecule recordings
                    (82)—as the reflection of a
                homogenous process (83) based on standard
                stochastic kinetics (84)—is being
                refined to incorporate conformation dynamics of individual receptor molecules to
                open-channel lifetime distributions. Advances along these lines are now beginning to
                provide the long-awaited bridge between protein physical chemistry and
                electrophysiological recordings.

Many of the reflections on REFERs presented here emerged from our discussions with R.
                Lape, D. Colquhoun, and L. Sivilotti on possible uses of REFERs to aid in the
                interpretation of the results described in their 2008 article on partial agonism,
                and we thank them for their stimulating and constructive interactions. We also thank

                        E for unliganded and monoliganded states, respectively.
                    Free-energy versus r‡ profiles were computed
                    from a general equation for harmonic wells:
                        r‡= k +
                        ((x − h)2/(4p)), where
                        h is the horizontal placement along
                        r‡ (h = 0 or 1);
                        k is the vertical placement; and p
                    is a flatness parameter. For profiles with minima at 0 and 1, the
                    intersection value, r‡X
                    is given by r‡x={−p0+p0p1[1−4(k0+k1)(p0−p1)]}/(p1−p0)
                    Intersection points of B, C,
                        E, and F occur at progressively lower
                    values of r‡ as the number of bound ligands
                    increases (for example, in B,
                        r‡ = 0.85 for the unliganded state and
                    0.76 for the diliganded states, based on a value of
                        αL = 0.8 for the monoliganded state; in
                        E, r‡ = 0.51, 0.55, and
                    0.59 for the diliganded, monoliganded, and unliganded states, respectively).
                    This progression to lower r‡ values is a
                    consequence of the geometry of the parabolic profiles.

Figure 2 Progression of opening and closing rates of the large-conductance
                    calcium-activated potassium channels according to the number of calcium ions
                    bound (19). Each point represents the
                    average of the three values for independent patches (presented in Table 3 of Cox
                    et al. (19)), with blue
                    diamonds for opening rates and green squares for closing rates. The straight
                    lines are calculated using αL = 0.65 from
                    least-squares fitting of successive rates with Eq. 1, with BAc =
                    0.11, the average for successive L values obtained from the
                    ratio of interconversion rates for each degree of ligand binding.

Figure 3 Application of REFERs to reactions of GlyR. (A) Reaction cycles
                    with two or three molecules of taurine (Tau) bound. Rate constants and
                    dissociation constants (KB and
                        KF) are from Lape et al. (20). Binding of the third molecule of
                    taurine stabilizes F relative to B by a factor of
                        KB/KF = 1.5 and A
                    relative to F by a factor of
                        KF/KA = 42.2; their
                    reciprocals give BFc and
                        FAc, respectively, used in the calculations in
                        B. A value for KA was not
                    presented by Lape et al., but was calculated from linkage relations.
                        (B) Energy diagram for the reactions in A
                    comparing predicted and observed energy barriers for the diliganded states
                        (red, observed; green, predicted), based
                    on the values reported for the triliganded states (blue). The
                    calculated values are obtained from the data in A using Eq. 1. TS heights (kcal/mole) were
                    calculated as described (4). Green areas
                    correspond to the limits for δ2
                        (A, left), with the lower TS barrier for
                        x′ = x with
                        αL = 0 and with the upper
                    barrier for y′ = y with
                        αL = 1 and for
                        β2 (A,
                        right), with the lower TS barrier for
                    y′ = y with
                        aL = 0 and with the upper barrier for
                        z′ = z with
                        aL = 1. Error bars from estimates in Lape
                    et al. are presented for the diliganded state only, since the errors are
                    essentially within the thickness of the line for the triliganded states. Barrier
                    heights may vary depending on specific assumptions of the TS theory (85), but the energy differences
                        x = x′, y =
                        y′, and z =
                    z′ would remain unchanged.
