==== Body
Vpu from HIV-1is an 81 amino acid monotopic viral membrane protein involved in the amplification of viral replication. Vpu is identified to down regulate membrane proteins of the host e.g. CD4, CD74, CD317 and BST-2/Tetherin. Based on the findings that Vpu exhibits channel activity especially when reconstituted into lipid membranes the protein is also proposed to act as a viral channel forming protein (VCP) in vivo. How Vpu is supposed to form the channel is unknown.

An unbiased computational structural modelling approach is presented to address two potential routes building up bundles of Vpu, a sequential and simultaneous route. In a fine grained docking approach in combination with molecular dynamics simulations [1, 2] the transmembrane domain of Vpu is assembled. A ridge-of-alanines motif [3] is likely to set the dimeric structure of the assembly. Independent of the assembly route lowest energy bundle structures adopt configurations with tryptophans (Trp-23) pointing inside the bundle. Applying short MD simulations structural stability of a series of bundles is assessed.
