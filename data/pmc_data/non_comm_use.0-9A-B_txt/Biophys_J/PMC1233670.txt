ABSTRACT Bacteriophage P22 binds to its cell surface receptor, the repetitive 0-antigen structure in Salmonella lipopoly-
saccharide, by its six homotrimeric tailspikes. Receptor binding by soluble tailspikes and the receptor-inactivating endo-
rhamnosidase activity of the tailspike protein were studied using octa- and dodecasaccharides comprising two and three
0-antigen repeats of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharides. Wild-type tailspike protein and
three mutants (D392N, D395N, and E359Q) with defective endorhamnosidase activity were used. Oligosaccharide binding to
all three subunits, measured by a tryptophan fluorescence quench or by fluorescence depolarization of a coumarin label
attached to the reducing end of the dodecasaccharide, occurs independently. At 100C, the binding affinities of all four
proteins to oligosaccharides from both bacterial strains are identical within experimental error, and the binding constants for
octa- and dodecasaccharides are 1 x 106 M-1 and 2 x 106 M-1, proving that two 0-antigen repeats are sufficient for
lipopolysaccharide recognition by the tailspike. Equilibration with the oligosaccharides occurs rapidly, but the endorhamno-
sidase produces only one cleavage every 100 s at 100C or about 2 min-1 at the bacterial growth temperature. Thus,
movement of virions in the lipopolysaccharide layer before DNA injection may involve the release and rebinding of individual
tailspikes rather than hydrolysis of the 0-antigen.

INTRODUCTION

The first step of a virus infection is the binding of the viral
particle to the surface of its host cell. Being an extracellular
reaction, the attachment represents an ideal target for agents
designed to interfere with the infection (Lentz, 1990). How-
ever, very few structural and biophysical data on the inter-
actions between viral adhesins and their host cell receptors
are available. The major reason is that both reaction part-
ners, the adhesin as a viral structural or envelope protein and
the cellular receptor, a membrane protein, glycoprotein, or
glycolipid, are usually insoluble and thus are hardly acces-
sible to solution biophysical methods.

One exception is the attachment apparatus of bacterio-
phage P22 (Israel et al., 1967). P22 belongs to a large group
of phages which, like many animal viruses, use surface
carbohydrates as receptors. Its adhesin is the 215-kDa,
homotrimeric tailspike protein. Up to six tailspikes are
attached at one vertex of the P22 capsid (Fig. 1), but three
spikes may be sufficient to form an infectious particle
(Israel, 1978). The P22 tailspike recognizes the repetitive
0-antigen in the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide of

pathogenic Salmonella species belonging to serogroups A,
B, and D,. Their 0-antigens have the main-chain trisaccha-
ride repeating unit a-D-mannose-( 1 >4)-a-L-rhamnose-
(1 ->3)-a-D-galactose-(1-4) in common, but differ in the
dideoxyhexose substituent at C-3 of the mannose (Fig. 1).

The P22 tailspike possesses endoglycosidase activity,
hydrolyzing the 0-antigen polysaccharide at the Rha-Gal
a(1 ->3)-glycosidic linkages and producing dimers of the
repeating unit as the main product. Receptor-inactivating
enzymatic activities are common to polysaccharide-specific
bacteriophages (Lindberg, 1977) and have been found in
many carbohydrate-specific animal viruses, like influenza,
paramyxo, and corona viruses. The 0-antigen polysaccha-
ride forms a carbohydrate layer extending about 100 nm
from the enterobacterial cell wall. Infection of Salmonella
by phage P22 is thought to require not only penetration of
the polysaccharide layer, but also a surface walk of the
phage particle to reach a site suitable for injection of the
phage DNA and accompanying proteins. The tailspike en-
dorhamnosidase activity has been implicated in both pro-
cesses (Lindberg, 1977; Bayer et al., 1980).

During normal infection, some excess tailspike accumu-
lates as a soluble protein, and soluble tailspikes can be
purified in large amounts from Salmonella infected by mu-
tant P22 defective in capsid assembly and from Escherichia
coli carrying a recombinant plasmid coding for the tailspike.
P22 tailspike protein lacking its amino-terminal 108-residue
head-binding domain is fully functional in carbohydrate
binding and hydrolysis (Danner et al., 1993). We have
recently succeeded in crystallizing this N-terminally short-
ened tailspike protein, and its x-ray structure has been
determined at 2.0 A resolution (Steinbacher et al., 1994).

FIGURE 1 Bacteriophage P22 recognizes lipopolysaccharide, its recep-
tor at the surface of the bacterial host cell, with its tailspikes. The phage
head binds six homotrimeric tailspikes, which are also accessible as soluble
proteins (cf. Fig. 2). Associated with the tailspike protein is a receptor-
inactivating enzymatic activity, which cleaves the repetitive 0-antigen
polysaccharide, the outer part of the lipopolysaccharide. The 0-antigens of
Salmonella strains susceptible to phage P22 contain around 20 repeats of a

common main-chain trisaccharide unit consisting of D-mannose, L-rham-

nose (6-deoxymannose), and D-galactose. They differ in the dideoxyhexose
(DDH) substituent at C-3 of the mannose, which is abequose (3,6-dideoxy-
galactose) in S. typhimurium, tyvelose (3,6-dideoxymannose) in S. enter-
itidis, and S. typhi and paratose (3,6-dideoxyglucose) in S. paratyphi. In
addition, the S. typhi 0-antigen carries a glucose substituent at C-4 of the
galactose that does not interfere with receptor binding and inactivation by
the P22 tailspike. The cleavage site of the endorhamnosidase activity is
indicated by the jagged arrow.

The main part of a tailspike subunit is formed by a large
right-handed parallel 3-helix of 13 complete turns, into
which a 63-residue domain of largely irregular structure is
inserted between the third and fourth helical turns (Fig. 2).
Beyond the 13-helices, the carboxy-terminal parts of the
three tailspike subunits are highly interdigitated, explaining
the thermal stability of the tailspike trimer and its unusual
folding pathway with a rate-determining folding reaction at
the trimer level (Goldenberg and King, 1982; Seckler et al.,
1989; Fuchs et al., 1991).

The cross section of the (3-helix is approximately trian-
gular, and a long groove is formed on its solvent-exposed
face between the inserted irregular domain and three longer
loops contained in turns 5, 7, and 8 of the 13-helix. It is in
this groove that the polysaccharide binding site of the tail-
spike adhesin has been identified by x-ray crystallography
of tailspike complexes with octasaccharides prepared from
S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium (Steinbacher et al., manu-
script submitted for publication). The purpose of the present
paper is a biophysical characterization of the interactions
between such lipopolysaccharide fragments of defined
length and the P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase. Using so-
lution biophysical methods, we have measured binding af-
finities of native and of fluorescence-labeled octa- and
dodecasaccharides from S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium to
wild-type tailspike protein and to mutants with strongly
reduced endorhamnosidase activity. We present a quantita-
tive description of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the
tailspike protein and investigate three active-site carboxy-

late residues suggested by the x-ray structure as critical in
the enzymatic mechanism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

The plasmid used for mutagenesis was a derivative of pASK30 with an
insert coding for an amino-terminal methionine followed by residues 109
to 666 of P22 tailspike protein, i.e., for the tailspike protein lacking its
amino-terminal head-binding domain (Danner et al., 1993). Lipopolysac-
charide fragments from Salmonella thyphimurium SH4809, serogroup B,
0-antigen 4,5,12; and S. enteritidis SH1262, serogroup DI, 0-antigen 9,12
were purified as described (Eriksson et al., 1979). The strains were from
the strain collection at the Division of Clinical Bacteriology, Huddinge
University Hospital. The 05 antigen is lost during the process of oligo-
saccharide preparation. Oligosaccharides were characterized as described
by Weintraub et al. (1988) and were quantified by their dry weights. Unless
indicated otherwise, S. enteritidis oligosaccharides were used in the exper-
iments. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (Amc) and NaCNBH3 were obtained
from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), acetonitrile was from J. T. Baker
(Deventer, England), and maltoheptaose was from Serva (Heidelberg,
Germany). Other chemicals were analysis grade, and quartz bidistilled
water was used throughout.

Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression,
and purification

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out essentially as described by
Kunkel et al. (1987), with slight variations (Yuckenberg et al., 1991).
Expression and purification of amino-terminally shortened tailspike pro-
teins were done as described for the wild-type protein (Steinbacher et al.,
1994; Miller, 1995). Their concentrations were determined using a specific
absorbance at 278 nm of AI Bg/ltlll = 1.1 1 (Danner et al., 1993). Purified
protein was stored as a suspension in 40% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 8.0.

Labeling of oligosaccharides

Oligosaccharides were chemically labeled at their reducing ends with the
fluorophore Amc in a reductive amination reaction, essentially as described
by Prakash and Vijai (1983). Oligosaccharide (1 ,umol) was dissolved in
500 ,ul methanol with 3 ,umol Amc and 20 ,ul acetic acid and kept for 1 h
at 37?C. After the addition of 5 ,tmol NaCNBH3 in 500 [lI methanol, the
mixture was further incubated at 37?C for at least 15 h. The solution was
dried in a vacuum centrifuge and redissolved in 50 ,ul acetonitrile/water
(1: 1 by volume). Labeled oligosaccharides were purified by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an Alltech Econosil
C,8 column (1 X 25 cm, 10-,lm particle size) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.
The weaker mobile phase (A) was 0.05% acetic acid, and the stronger
mobile phase (B) was 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.05% acetic acid. A
gradient of 10% B to 30% B in 60 min was used, and the labeled
oligosaccharides were detected by their absorbance at 350 nm. The result
of the purification was checked by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatog-
raphy on RP-18F'54s plates from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Samples
containing labeled oligosaccharides were lyophilized and redissolved in
water. The concentration was determined by UV absorbance using an
extinction coefficient of 17,000 M- cm-' at 360 nm (Kanaoka et al.,
1985).

Endorhamnosidase assay

To start the enzyme reaction, tailspike (10 ,tg/ml) and labeled dodecasac-
charide were mixed in a total volume of 100 to 400 ,l1 of 60 mM phosphate

buffer, pH 7.0. At varied times, 20-,ul aliquots were removed and added to

neutralized with 2.5 ,ld 0.5 M NaOH. The samples were analyzed by
reversed-phase HPLC on a Beckmann ODS column (0.46 X 25 cm,
particle size 5 ,um) at a flow rate of 1 mUmin. The gradient used was 10%
B to 30% B in 20 min, and the Amc label was detected with a Merck
Hitachi FI000 fluorescence detector at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm
and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Dodecasaccharide and tetrasac-
charide peaks were integrated using the program PeakFit (Jandel Scientif-
ic), and the ratio of the peak areas was used to calculate the amount of
tetrasaccharide produced.

Oligosaccharide binding measured by
fluorescence titrations

Protein fluorescence was measured in stirred cells (1.2 ml) employing a
Spex Fluoromax spectrofluorimeter with a thermostatted cell holder. The
excitation wavelength was 295 nm (spectral bandpass 2 nm) and emission
was at 347 nm (bandpass 6 nm), corresponding to the maximum in the
fluorescence difference spectrum between native tailspike protein and the

tailspike-oligosaccharide complex. The protein concentration was 0.1-0.2
,uM tailspike subunits in 60 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; the oligosac-
charide concentration was varied between 0.4 ,uM and 0.1 mM by the
addition of 3-,ul aliquots of oligosaccharide stock solution. After each
addition, the sample was stirred for at least 1 min (no change was detected
thereafter). The sample volume was not changed more than 5% over the
titration, the protein fluorescence signal was corrected for the dilution, and
the change of fluorescence due to absorption of oligosaccharide (inner
filter effect) was less than 1%. Assuming one binding site per subunit and
no cooperativity between the sites in the trimer, the dissociation constants
for oligosaccharide binding were determined by nonlinear least-squares
fitting of the data to the equation

F = Fo + AF(Eo + Lo + KD - ((EO + LO + KD)2

- 4LoEo)"'2)/2Eo,

where F is the measured fluorescence, Fo is the fluorescence of the free
protein, AF is the change in fluorescence at saturation, Eo and Lo are the

total concentrations of protein and oligosaccharide, respectively, and KD is
the dissociation constant. Fits were done by the Marquardt-Levenberg
algorithm, as implemented in SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific).

Binding measurements by

fluorescence depolarization

Fluorescence polarization was measured in a Perkin-Elmer MPF-3L spec-
trofluorimeter with a thermostatted cell holder and the polarization equip-
ment provided by Perkin-Elmer. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm,
and emission was recorded at 450 nm with 5-nm and 10-nm spectral
bandpass, respectively. D392N mutant protein (3 ,uM subunits in 60 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was titrated with 3-j.l aliquots of a DodAmc
stock solution at 1OC (DodAmc, OctAmc, and TetAmc are Salmonella
0-antigen oligosaccharides of 3, 2, and 1 repeating units labeled at their
reducing ends with Amc). Fluorescence intensities with parallel and per-
pendicular orientation of the polarizers were measured at least 2 min after
each addition.

The polarizations and fluorescence efficiencies of the free and the
bound DodAmc pf, Qf, and Pb, Qb were determined by extrapolation to
infinite protein concentration (Dandliker et al., 1981), as illustrated in Fig.
5. The dissociation constant was determined by nonlinear least-squares fit
of the data to the following system of equations resulting from the defi-
nition of KD for ligand binding to independent identical sites, and from
equation 8 of Dandliker et al. (1981)

Lb = (nEO + KD + Lo - ((nEO + KD + L)2 - 4nEOL1)"12)12
W = (Qf/Qb)(Lo - Lb)/Lb)
p = (Wpf + pb)/(W? 1)-

In these equations, Lb and Lo are the bound and total concentrations of
ligand, respectively; KD is the dissociation constant; n is the number of
independent identical binding sites; Eo is the total protein concentration;
and p is the measured polarization.

RESULTS

Previous biochemical assays for the enzymatic activity as-
sociated with bacteriophage tails relied on the liberation of
radioactivity from labeled cell envelopes (Iwashita and
Kanegasaki, 1976a; Svenson et al., 1979; Berget and Po-
teete, 1980) or on the determination of reducing ends pro-
duced by the glycosidic cleavage of partially purified Sal-
monella polysaccharide (Seckler et al., 1989; Danner et al.,
1993). Because we found such assays to be unsuitable for a
quantitative analysis of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by
the P22 tailspike protein and a characterization of the cat-
alytic mechanism, we attempted to set up an endorhamno-
sidase assay based on a homogeneous substrate. The small-
est substrate known to be efficiently cleaved by the enzyme,
a dodecasaccharide fragment from Salmonella lipopolysac-
charide purified by gel filtration chromatography (Wein-
traub et al., 1988), was labeled at its reducing end by
reductive amination with the fluorescent dye Amc, and the
labeled oligosaccharide was purified by reversed-phase
HPLC. Upon incubation with purified P22 tailspike protein,
the labeled dodecasaccharide was efficiently cleaved into
labeled tetrasaccharide and unlabeled octasaccharide, as
identified by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography

Endorhamnosidase activity of the
wild-type protein

For quantitative analysis of DodAmc cleavage, reversed-
phase HPLC with fluorescence detection was used (Fig. 3).
At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the HPLC retention times of
DodAmc, OctAmc, and TetAmc were 16.8 min, 17.5 min,
and 18.1 min, respectively. Fig. 3 A shows the elution
profiles of pure DodAmc and of a sample from a 15-min
incubation at 10?C with purified wild-type protein. As the
amino-terminal head-binding domain of the tailspike pro-
tein is dispensable for oligosaccharide binding and hydro-
lysis (Danner et al., 1993), wild-type and point mutant
proteins used in this study lack the N-terminal 108 residues
that interfere with the crystallographic analysis (Steinbacher
et al., 1994). We have not detected any significant differ-
ences between full-length and N-terminally shortened pro-
teins in the oligosaccharide hydrolysis and binding assays
used. The HPLC peaks of DodAmc and TetAmc were very
well separated and could be integrated independently. The
fraction of TetAmc was calculated from the peak areas, and
the rate of DodAmc hydrolysis was found to be nearly
constant up to 10% total turnover (Fig. 3 B). Rates deter-
mined at increasing substrate concentrations increased in a
hyperbolic fashion, and a fit of the data to the Michaelis-
Menten equation yielded a KM of 2.3 ? 0.3 ,uM and a
turnover rate constant of kcat = 0.01 ? 0.002 s-1 at 10?C
(Fig. 3 C). To achieve substrate saturation, the DodAmc

concentration was kept above 25 X KD of the unlabeled

dodecasaccharide measured at the respective temperature
(cf. below). An Arrhenius plot of the rates measured under
these conditions between 2?C and 20?C was close to linear
and resulted in an activation energy of 35 ? 5 kJ/mol.

Hydrolytic activity of mutant proteins

Based on the x-ray structure of a S. enteritidis octasaccha-
ride complexed to the wild-type protein (Steinbacher et al.,
manuscript submitted for publication), three candidate ac-
tive-site carboxylates were selected for site-directed mu-
tagenesis. These residues are Asp392, Asp395, and Glu359.
They were replaced by the corresponding amides in the
mutants D392N, D395N, and E359Q, respectively. Upon
expression in E. coli, the mutant proteins folded efficiently
and could be purified to homogeneity, as judged by gel
electrophoresis with silver staining. None of the mutants
showed detectable DodAmc hydrolysis at 10?C. At 37?C
and a tailspike subunit concentration of 1.7 ,uM, significant
turnover by the mutant proteins was detected after 1-4
days. Under these conditions, the wild-type protein hydro-
lyzes 10% of the DodAmc in less than 1 min. Because the
mutants bind oligosaccharides with wild-type affinities (cf.
below), their turnover numbers could be estimated directly
from the observed TetAmc production. They are reduced to
about 1/30,000 (D392N), 1/25,000 (D395N), and 1/10,000

(data not shown).

The tailspike subunit concentration was 170 nM.

Oligosaccharide binding equilibria

Upon addition of purified Salmonella 0-antigen fragments,
the intrinsic fluorescence of the tailspike protein was sig-
nificantly quenched and blue-shifted (Fig. 4 A). At satura-
tion, the reduction in fluorescence intensity was 19 ? 1%
for the wild-type and between 13% and 22% for the mutant
proteins (Table 1). The fluorescence quench can be ratio-
nalized by two out of seven tryptophans of each tailspike
subunit being located in the oligosaccharide binding site
(Steinbacher et al., manuscript submitted for publication).
Both tryptophans (residues 365 and 391) are highly solvent-
exposed in the structure of the unliganded protein, and more
exposed than any of the other tailspike tryptophans. Thus,
quenching of emission from W365 and W391 by the bound
oligosaccharide is expected to result in a blue shift concom-
itant with a reduction in intensity. The observed spectral
change allowed us to determine the equilibrium constants
for the binding of a number of oligosaccharides to wild-type
and mutant tailspike proteins by fluorescence titrations.
Example titrations for the wild-type protein with octasac-
charides from S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis are pre-
sented in Fig. 4 B, together with a maltoheptaose control. As
evident from the results of nonlinear regression represented
by the solid lines, the titrations were well described by
hyperbolic binding to a single class of binding sites. The
dissociation constants for both octasaccharides (KD = 0.9 +
0.1 ,uM; cf. Table 1) were identical within experimental
error.

The binding affinities to Salmonella 0-antigen octa- and
dodecasaccharide fragments, i.e., to product and substrate of
the endorhamnosidase reaction, were measured for the mu-
tant proteins E359Q, D392N, and D395N, which did not
hydrolyze significant amounts of dodecasaccharide during
the fluorescence titrations. All three mutants bound octasac-
charides with wild-type affinity (Table 1), whereas the
dissociation constants of octasaccharide complexes with
four other point mutants (E359G, W391G, V331A, V331G,
data not shown) were 10-100-fold higher. Binding con-
stants for the dodecasaccharides were twofold higher than
those of the octasaccharides. Again, oligosaccharides from
the two Salmonella species bound with equal affinity, and
binding by the three mutants was not significantly different.

The temperature dependence of the equilibria was char-
acterized for octa- and dodecasaccharide binding to D392N,
and for octasaccharide binding to the wild-type protein (Fig.
4 C). Upwardly curved van't Hoff plots were observed in all
three cases, indicating a large negative heat capacity change
upon binding. The van't Hoff enthalpies for the binding of
octa- and dodecasaccharide to D392N at 250C (AHVH,oCt

-68 ? 1 kJ/mol and AHVH,dod  -73 ? 3 kJ/mol, averages
of results obtained in two independent series of binding
experiments) were very similar but significantly larger than
the value observed for the binding of octasaccharide to
wild-type tailspikes (A1HVH  -49  + 2 kJ/mol).

Binding of the assay substrate and
oligosaccharide binding kinetics

As evident from the data presented above, the largely inac-
tive mutants D392N, D395N, and E359Q bound oligosac-
charides with identical affinities, and their binding affinities
for the octasaccharides were not different from that of the
wild-type protein. Thus, the common dissociation constant
of their dodecasaccharide complexes (0.4 ? 0.1 ,uM) ap-
peared likely to reflect the binding affinity of the wild-type
endorhamnosidase for the unlabeled substrate. On the other
00 420 440 460        hand, the Michaelis constant of the enzyme for DodAmc

was more than fivefold higher at the same temperature. This
,nm)                  difference might reflect 1) slow substrate dissociation, 2) a

higher dodecasaccharide binding affinity of the mutants, or
.010'1,           3) interference of the fluorescence label with binding. The
A       A  A          results of three types of experiments prove the latter to be

correct.

First, we attempted to measure the dissociation kinetics
of a preformed oligosaccharide-protein complex. When a
solution of D392N tailspikes (2 ,uM subunits), upon equil-
_ ibration with 5 ,uM dodecasaccharide (>90% saturation),

was diluted 100-fold into a stirred cell at 10?C, no change in
fluorescence intensity was observed after the dead time of
manual mixing (-5 s), and the fluorescence signal (Aex =
8     30 60          295 nm, Acm = 347 nm) was that expected for <10%
1 (PM)                saturation. From this result, lower limits for the dissociation

and association rate constants were estimated to koff = 0.3

s-1 and kcm = 4 X 105 M-1 s-1.

Second, we tried to estimate the binding constant for
unlabeled dodecasaccharide to wild-type tailspike protein.
Because substrate binding was found to be fast compared to
the mixing time and much faster than substrate turnover
(kcat = 0.01 s-1), the fluorescence quench upon binding
could be determined by adding dodecasaccharide at varying
concentrations to samples of wild-type protein and extrap-
olating the observed fluorescence intensity to the time of
mixing. The dissociation constant of the dodecasaccharide
3.4   3.5   3.6      complex with wild-type protein so determined was 0.5 +

0.2 ,uM.

Third, the binding of DodAmc to D392N mutant protein
a tryptophan fluorescence  was measured by fluorescence depolarization (Fig. 5).
(imum. (A) Fluorescence  Quenching of protein fluorescence could not be used for the

Titrations of tailspike proteins with oligosaccharides were done at 10?C as described in Materials and Methods. AF/FO is the fractional decrease in
tryptophan fluorescence intensity upon complex formation, KD is the dissociation constant, and AGO = RT lnKD is the standard free energy of binding.

DISCUSSION

The interactions of the tailspike protein with Salmonella
0-antigen oligosaccharides at around 10?C can be summa-
rized in a simple scheme:

kcat? 01 s5

Dodecasaccharide * TSP       > Octasaccharide-TSP

fast ] I KD  10-6 M                + Tetrasaccharide
Dodecasaccharide + TSP         fast 2P KD  10-6 M

Octasaccharide + TSP

This model is based on results obtained with wild-type
tailspike protein and with three mutant proteins that bind
oligosaccharides with wild-type affinity but do not hydro-
lyze significant amounts over the time course of a binding
titration. The binding equilibria for substrate and product
are fast compared to the rate of hydrolysis. Equilibration
with free oligosaccharide is observed in the dead time of
manual mixing, and the KM for the labeled dodecasaccha-
ride DodAmc in the endorhamnosidase reaction catalyzed
by the wild type closely coincides with its KD determined by
fluorescence depolarization with the D392N mutant. The
general scheme also holds at the physiological temperature
of around 35?C, although both dissociation constants and
the catalytic rate are three- to fivefold higher.

As the binding constants and their temperature depen-
dence are similar for octa- and dodecasaccharides, the ad-
ditional 0-antigen repeating unit in the dodecasaccharide
appears to contribute little to the interactions. This is con-
sistent with the observation that the binding free energy of
DodAmc is reduced by less than 1 kcal/mol, although the
pyranose ring at the reducing end of the dodecasaccharide is
broken and a bulky fluorescence label is added by the
chemical modification. Oligosaccharides from S. enteritidis
and S. typhimurium, in which the side-chain dideoxyhex-
oses are tyvelose (3,6-dideoxymannose) and abequose (3,6-
dideoxygalactose), bind to the tailspike with essentially
identical affinities, in agreement with the two Salmonella
species being equally susceptible to infection by bacterio-
phage P22 (Eriksson et al., 1979). The temperature depen-
dence of the equilibrium constants indicates a large negative
heat capacity change upon oligosaccharide binding. Com-
pared to literature values for the binding of monosacccha-
rides to proteins, this value appears unusual, but large heat
capacity changes on the order observed here have been
reported for the binding of oligosaccharides to antibodies

(Zidovetzki et al., 1988; Sigurskjold and Bundle, 1992). A
negative heat capacity change is usually taken to indicate a
significant reduction of exposed hydrophobic surface area.
Accordingly, the large heat capacity change observed for
the tailspike-oligosaccharide interaction (1-2 kJ mol- 1K- I;
compare Spolar and Record, 1994) is compatible with most,
if not all, of the sugar residues interacting closely with the
tailspike protein in the complex with the octasaccharide

FIGURE 5 Binding of coumarin-labeled dodecasaccharide to D392N
tailspike protein. The increase in polarization of the coumarin label upon
binding of DodAmc to tailspike protein was used to characterize the
binding equilibrium. (A) D392N mutant protein was titrated with DodAmc,
and the polarization data were evaluated as described in Materials and
Methods. The polarization and specific fluorescence of the bound label
were determined as illustrated in B and C for the polarization (Dandliker et
al., 1981). Briefly, D392N protein was titrated with DodAmc at tailspike
subunit concentrations of 30.5 AM (0), 15.2 ,uM (U), 7.6 ,uM (A), and 5.1
,uM (V). Ordinate intercepts (p') were extrapolated to infinite protein

(Steinbacher et al., manuscript submitted for publication).
Although wild-type and D392N mutant tailspikes bind oc-
tasaccharide and dodecasaccharide with essentially identical
affinities at 10?C, differences above experimental error
were observed between the two proteins in the van't Hoff
enthalpies of octasaccharide binding and their temperature
dependencies. There is no obvious explanation for this
result, and further studies by titration calorimetry and x-ray
crystallography will be required to resolve this apparent
difference in the mode of binding.

Compared to other endoglycosidases, the P22 tailspike
endorhamnosidase has a remarkably low turnover number
but a high substrate binding affinity. This may have been
expected, as the principal function of the tailspike protein is
to attach the bacteriophage to its host's cell surface. Al-
though the bacteriophage particle holds six tailspike trimers,
each of which can bind three oligosaccharides, only three or
four binding sites appear to be used simultaneously (Israel,
1978). Nevertheless, the observed binding free energies of
close to 30 kJ/mol for each site at physiological temperature
add up to essentially irreversible attachment. Rapid release
and rebinding of individual tailspikes to pairs of 0-antigen
repeats may prevent the phage from becoming stuck at
unproductive sites, i.e., locations not suitable for DNA
injection.

Even at physiological temperature, the enzyme will
cleave only one oligosaccharide every 30 s. What is the
significance of the slow endorhamnosidase activity? En-
doglycosidase activities of bacteriophage tail particles have
been assumed to be required for the lateral movement of
phage particles to a DNA injection site or to clear a path
through the lipopolysaccharide layer down to the outer
membrane of the bacterium (Lindberg, 1977; Bayer et al.,
1980). For P22, lateral movement is more likely to occur
through receptor relase and rebinding than by its hydrolysis.
Phage attachment and DNA uptake require only seconds to
very few minutes at physiological temperature, during
which the enzymatic activity would hardly be sufficient to
cut a clearing into the lipopolysaccharide jungle. Further-
more, the tail structures of S. anatum bacteriophage g34, are
associated with an esterase activity capable of inactivating,
but not physically shortening, the receptor 0-antigen
(Iwashita and Kanegasaki, 1976b; Bayer et al., 1980). On
the other hand, the receptor-inactivating activities of carbo-
hydrate-specific bacteriophages may be required upon com-
pletion of an infectious cycle for detachment of newly
assembled viral particles from the host cell debris. Recent
studies on the neuraminidases and esterases of influenza
viruses indicate that these analogs of the P22 tailspike
endorhamnosidase activity, in fact, facilitate the release of
viral particles into the supernatant and are dispensible for
viral entry (Herrler et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1995; Huberman
et al., 1995).

In contrast to earlier bacteriophage endoglycosidase mu-
tants (Berget and Poteete, 1980; Schwarz and Berget, 1989),
the new point mutants characterized in this study affect only
the inactivation, but not the binding of the phage receptor.

They should prove to be valuable tools for defining the
function of the P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase activity.

The observed protein fluorescence change upon oligosac-
charide binding is likely due to quenching of two tryptophan
residues (W365 and W391) that contact the octasaccharide
in the x-ray structure of the complex (Steinbacher et al.,
manuscript submitted for publication). Aromatic residues
are a frequent feature of carbohydrate binding sites in pro-
teins (Vyas, 1991). Experimental support for the oligosac-
charide contacts to both W365 and W391 being responsible
for the fluorescence change comes from the fact that the
fluorescence quench upon oligosaccharide binding to a mu-
tant that lacks Trp391 is reduced to about half the amplitude
observed for the wild type (B. Schuler and R. Seckler,
unpublished data). All seven of the tryptophan residues of
the tailspike protein are partially accessible to solvent, but
W365 and W391 are among the least buried. They are
expected to exhibit a high Stokes' shift, providing an ex-
planation for the observed blue shift of fluorescence emis-
sion upon binding of the 0-antigen fragments.

Although glycosidases are structurally diverse, they are
believed to function through common catalytic mechanisms
involving at least one carboxylate residue in retaining en-
zymes and at least two carboxylate residues in inverting
enzymes (Koshland, 1953; Withers and Aebershold, 1995).
It is not known whether the tailspike endorhamnosidase
retains or inverts the configuration during hydrolysis of the
glycosidic bond. Three acidic residues (E359, D392, D395)
are located near the reducing end of the octasaccharide in
the structure of the enzyme-product complex (Steinbacher
et al., manuscript submitted for publication). All three ap-
pear to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, because the
mutations to the corresponding amides resulted in a nearly
total loss of activity without significantly affecting the bind-
ing of substrate and product. The amide mutants may
help to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of this
endoglycosidase.

gemeinschaft and the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie.
