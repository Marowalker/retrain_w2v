Viral ion channels, such as the coronavirus envelope proteins (E protein), belong to a family of channels that have attracted a considerable amount of interest during recent years. However, not many studies on the electrophysiology have been performed; mainly due to the fact that these channels are membrane proteins that do not easily express in the outer membrane of bacteria. Moreover, the channel currents are small (on the order of 10-300 pS) when compared with bacterial outer membrane channels. In our studies, we reconstituted the full-length channel-forming E protein from murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV-A59) into 3:1:1 POPE:POPS:POPC lipid bilayers that were suspended either across 150 μm diameter apertures in polystyrene cups or across a 50 μm diameter aperture in silicon. Lipid bilayers were formed using the painting method on all substrates, resulting in reproducible Gigaseal formation. The aperture in silicon was prepared using photolithography and dry reactive ion etching, resulting in excellent reproducibility of the pore geometry. The surface was coated hydrophobically to allow lipid bilayer attachment.

Bilayers created in the presence of E-protein in solution showed reproducible ion channel activity, independent of the substrate used. We were able to identify the signature conductance steps of E ion channels. Similar to what has been shown previously using the OmpF ion channel of E. coli, the ion channel activity on the silicon substrate was identical to that measured using the polystyrene cup, indicating the feasibility of the silicon substrate for the investigation of ion channels with conductances in the range of tens of picosiemens. Using silicon apertures for ion channel reconstitution experiments in array geometry provides an opportunity to increase measurement throughput.
