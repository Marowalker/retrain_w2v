A quote from an article by M. Colleen Stainton, RN, DNSc, FCN(NSW), in Sigma Theta Tau's Reflections on Nursing Leadership highlights for me a frequent experience for perioperative nurses.
Good nursing practice has inherent power. For the nurse, it is a visceral experience signaling that a connection was made; the skill selected was accurate and appropriately applied; and the timing, word, or touch was helpful in fostering healing and recovery. Every nurse knows that feeling, as [do] those receiving care. This connection—this power—is restorative and reaffirming for the nurse. It is what keeps nurses nursing. A synergy and energy may occur for only a moment of time, but when it does, neither person will ever forget it.1(p16)




This quote also mirrors for me a relationship between perioperative nurses and AORN, our professional organization. AORN provides educational experiences, networking opportunities, and research to enable nurses to make those connections for providing optimal patient care. AORN strengthens the power of nursing. I invite you to join us and get powered up for yourself and your patients.

September is the month that many AORN chapters start their year after a summer sojourn. The chapters continue to be the major force through which our members interact with AORN. It is this association that has made us strong and globally predominant in perioperative nursing; therefore, we must continue to support this model for those members who enjoy the benefits offered by chapter affiliation. I would like to share some highlights from the Leadership Conference that was held in Denver July 15 to 17 and information about the work that is being done in AORN committees and task forces that will provide you, the practitioner, with the benefits of their endeavors and the synergy and energy to have a productive AORN year.

The Leadership Conference
The Leadership Conference provided chapter, specialty assembly, and state council leaders with practical sessions on creative methods for discussing practice issues at meetings and providing contact hours in person or via electronic means. For example, our National “Time Out” Day initiative this year highlighted labeling of medications. The “Time Out” Day materials are ideal resources for a chapter presentation on medication safety.

The Leadership Conference was expanded to include a diverse audience that was interested in developing creative leadership skills and strategies. Sessions on teaching young children about nursing included tools to develop age specific curricula and content that can be taken into schools to educate children about perioperative nursing. These are great resources for Perioperative Nurse Week when our “Vital to Care, Knowledge to Share” theme will encourage chapter members to visit grade schools and spread the word about perioperative nursing. These resources also can be used for age-specific patient education in clinical sites, and they are available via a link from the AORN Online home page at http://www.aorn.org under “What's New.” The AORN Board and staff members are making a concerted effort to provide all of our members with the resources they need to maintain their education and competence and recruit and retain members and future perioperative nurses.

The Work of AORN Committees and Task Forces
AORN members are volunteering their time and expertise on 29 committees and task forces and are liaisons or ad hoc members to 19 professional organizations and regulatory groups. These members advance the practice of peri-operative nursing through their efforts. I want you to have a preview of the work that will be brought to the House of Delegates for your approval in 2006, and I also want you to see the breadth of work being accomplished to support and protect you in your practice and profession.


• The Advanced Practice Issues Task Force is reviewing and revising the “AORN position statement on the definition of perioperative advanced practice nurse”2 and the “Perioperative advanced practice nurse competency statements”3 to include advanced practice RN first assistants.

• The Allied Health Care Providers and Assistive Personnel Task Force will review AORN's position statement on unlicensed assistive personnel4 and Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs standards and guidelines for accreditation of educational programs in surgical technology to create a position statement on the role of the RN in the education of students who will be assistive personnel.

• The Awards Committee is busy educating members about the new awards process and preparing for a creative new event at Congress that will recognize our award winners and highlight their award-winning initiatives. This new process will open the potential for winning awards to chapters that use diverse methods to get their message out. The process is restricted only by your imagination. I can't wait to see the results.

• The CMS Informed Consent Task Force was charged with soliciting input from members and developing specific examples of problems in implementing the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines on informed consent. They also will develop solutions that meet the spirit of what CMS is trying to accomplish. Our plan is to take these solutions to CMS for its consideration in light of its implementation of the current guidelines, which will be difficult to operationalize and maintain in hospitals and will place a definite burden on perioperative nurses.

• The Congress Education Planning Committee has selected the education sessions for our 2006 Congress, and committee members are busy processing Clinical Improvement/Innovation Poster submissions.

• The Emergency Management Task Force is charged with developing a guideline on how perioperative nurses can prepare to manage severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu, and other possible epidemics.

• The Environmental Task Force is developing a position and guidance statement on environmental responsibility in perioperative areas. They also will review the “Recommended practices for surgical tissue banking.”5


• International Resource Committee members serve as our advisors to support AORN in becoming the global leader in perioperative nursing. This group is collaborating on the two major international meetings for 2005, the World Conference in Barcelona, Spain, and the Americas Conference in Cancun, Mexico. This is a collaborative effort among AORN members and industry and international partners.

• The Legislative Committee is charged with facilitating the identification, implementation, and passage of efforts to add prescriptive language requiring an RN in the circulator role to the administrative or legislative codes of additional states. These initiatives will require active grassroots support in the identified bellwether states (ie, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington).

• The Management Issues Task Force Just Culture will develop position and guidance statements on a just response to errors in the perioperative environment and creating a “no-blame culture.”

• The Members-at-Large (MAL) Task Force is evaluating the criteria for MAL membership so the Board can examine how this contingent of our membership will interface with the Association going forward.

• The Membership Committee is at the forefront of recruitment and retention initiatives. These group members are out there among you; they are the pulse of AORN. Then-Open House at Headquarters on the Friday night of the Leadership Conference was, as always, a real celebration of our members. Committee members also joined Board members in making presentations about practice issues at the conference and during the breakfast breakout sessions. You will see them at the First-Time Attendee Breakfast at Congress, as well as at the “Chapter Nuts and Bolts” Pre-Congress session. They are everywhere. Look for them, ask questions, or give advice. They love it.

• The Mentoring Task Force introduced a new, formal Mentoring Program at the Leadership Conference that will connect potential leaders who are looking for a mentor with past AORN leaders for one-on-one guidance. We are wealthy with leaders who are willing to share their expansive wisdom and knowledge with future leaders. The Mentoring Program will facilitate this connection for interested members.

• The National Committee on Education (NCE) will be standardizing the format to address Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) terminology in the RN orientation position6 and guidance statements. The committee also will create position and guidance statements on orientation of novice to expert surgical technologists.

• The Next Generation Task Force has been instrumental in collaborating with the organization to assist in recognizing the needs of young nurses and in fostering their leadership skills. They will present a session at Congress on recruiting and retaining young perioperative nurses. This task force also is involved in the Extreme Chapter Makeover. The struggling Central Ohio chapter is working with Cynthia D'Amour, president and leadership coach of People Power Unlimited, Ann Arbor, Mich, to reengineer, reenergize, and completely change the look and feel of this chapter. D'Amour spoke at the 2001 AORN Leadership Conference where she gave us a long list of initiatives to recruit members and energize chapters. AORN of Central Ohio was losing members, attendance at meetings was declining rapidly, and participation had dwindled. They were in a downward spiral, and it was time to either do something drastic or disband. The results of this makeover will be available to all chapters at Congress so that we all may benefit from the lessons learned in Central Ohio. Get ready to use their model for your own chapter makeover.

• Nursing Practices Committee members are charged with reviewing and revising the AORN position statements on nurse-to-patient ratios7 and industry representatives8 and the guidance statement on reuse of single-use devices.9 They also anticipate collaborating with the NCE on review and revision of the competency statements in perioperative nursing.10


• The Nursing Research Committee and the PNDS Task Force are collaborating to develop a research study using the data collected from the electronic national benchmark database. If you want a preview of how the PNDS can be used, see the article that starts on page 51 of the July 2005 AORN Journal.11


• The On-Call Electronic Task Force will help the Board develop implementation strategies to facilitate the “AORN position statement on safe work/on-call practices”12 that was approved at Congress in 2005. At Congress, 23 members volunteered to work on this initiative.

• The Perioperative Nursing: Introduction at High School/Grade School Level Task Force will develop resources for chapters and members to use in schools for education on perioperative nursing. These resources will be available at http://www.aorn.org/about/nurseweek.htm. Get ready to use them during Perioperative Nurse Week. How many schools can we visit, and how many students can we touch? It is all up to us.

• The Perioperative Professional Excellence Criteria Task Force will develop criteria and measurement tools for perioperative professional excellence. Not all hospitals can be Magnet facilities, but we believe all perioperative services can be considered excellent if they meet specific criteria.

• The Presidential Commission on Patient Safety Task Force will concentrate on medication safety for adult and pediatric patients. The National “Time Out” Day campaign was an example of the resources that are available for our members to improve patient safety processes. Part of the commission's charge is to monitor the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' National Patient Safety Goals and collaborate with other organizations, such as the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management.

• The Recommended Practices Committee continues to review and revise AORN recommended practices and develop strategies for moving the committee toward developing evidence-based practices and incorporating PNDS terminology. Their collaboration with members on the Presidential Commission on Patient Safety Task Force will result in recommended practices to prevent inadvertent hypothermia.

• The Specialty Assembly (SA) Futures Task Force is researching and developing a new model for the SAs. Research demonstrates that members of the younger generations do not want to participate in the organization through the traditional chapter model. We cannot afford to lose these members as future leaders who will drive the profession of perioperative nursing. We believe that the new SA model will attract them, and that was the purpose of offering a free SA membership through the Member Access proposal that was passed by the House of Delegates in 2005. The new web portals for the SAs were kicked off on July 1, 2005. This is step one in connecting all the members with the SAs and strengthening services to the specialty areas. Go online and take part in the energizing discussions. A leadership laboratory will be developed to support future growth of the organization.

• The Web Task Force is collaborating with AORN staff members to reengineer web services to members. These task force members serve as the members' voice regarding web strategy. They are in the process of implementing a listing of AORN committees and task forces with chair and member contact information and a method for members to communicate issues, needs, information, or discussion related to the work in progress.

• The Workplace Safety Task Force is researching and preparing to present a position statement and guidelines on ergonomically healthy workplace practices for the perioperative environment. This task force is collaborating with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the American Nurses Association on the “Handle With Care” ergonomics campaign.13





In addition to the work of these groups, we continue to support our members through the AORN Ombudsman and the AORN Academic Liaison. Ombudsman Vivian C. Watson, RN, CNOR, is available to investigate and resolve complaints or problems between members, the AORN Board of Directors, or AORN staff members. The AORN Academic Liaison, Debra L. Fawcett, RN, PhD, maintains communication and interaction with the National League for Nursing, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and National Student Nurses' Association to promote the use of perioperative nursing within curricula.

The Payoff
The volunteer members feel synergy and energy through their work, but the great payoff comes during the House of Delegates sessions at Congress when the work is discussed, debated, and, potentially, approved. Then the connection is made, and the members take the work back to their clinical areas to implement so that the nurses' environment is safer and patient care results in quality outcomes. We all make it happen—the synergy, the energy, the best of perioperative nursing.
