==== Body
QUESTION: I work at an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) and have heard that we need an infection control coordinator. Is this true? What is the basis for the requirement?


ANSWER: On August 31, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published proposed changes to the ASC conditions for coverage (CFCs), including the Conditions for Coverage—Infection Control.1 The new CFCs took effect on January 1, 2009, with some amendments becoming effective May 18, 2009.

According to CMS rule §416.51(b) and §416.51(b)(1), an ASC “must maintain an ongoing infection control program designed to prevent, control, and investigate infections and communicable diseases.”2 This program should be “under the direction of a designated and qualified professional who has training in infection control.”2 The ASC administrators must designate, in writing, the individual or group of individuals who are qualified through education, training, experience, or certification to be an infection control professional.

If the ASC is not Medicare or Medicaid certified but is accredited by one of several ambulatory accreditation organizations (eg, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care [AAAHC], the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities [AAAASF], the Joint Commission), specific infection control requirements must be met for the health care organization to retain its accreditation status. For additional information refer to AAAHC Standard 5—Quality Management and Improvement3
(p30–33) and Standard 8—Facilities and Environment, items B through P,3
(p37–38) and AAAASF Standard 5.001.61.0 through 5.001.65.0.4
(p28–29)


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines an infection control professional as
a person whose primary training is in either nursing, medical technology, microbiology, or epidemiology, and who has acquired specialized training in infection control.5(p51–52)




On July 10, 2008, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) began referring to infection control professionals as infection preventionists because of their expanding roles.6 Activities that are typical of an infection preventionist (eg, coordinator, officer) include, but are not limited to, the following:
• oversight of employee health services related to infection prevention (eg, exposure to and treatment of infectious diseases, tuberculosis screening, administration of vaccines);

• staff member and volunteer health, education, and infection control training;

• preparedness for annual outbreaks (eg, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome);

• monitoring of selected infection control practices;

• monitoring the environment for safety and sanitation;

• oversight of risk assessment and implementation of preventive measures associated with construction and renovation;

• prevention of multidrug-resistant organism transmission;

• communication with facility staff members and state and local health department personnel concerning infection control issues;

• evaluation of new medical products that could be associated with an increased infection risk (eg, infusion devices and equipment); and

• participation in research projects.4, 7





The CMS does not mandate that the ASC administrators, the infection preventionist, and staff members follow one specific infection control guideline. Ambulatory surgery center administrators should consider all related regulations and standards and base their infection control policies and procedures on the needs of the facility. These regulations and standards are authored by several nationally recognized infection control organizations, including but not limited to:
• the CDC Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee—http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/guidelines.html;

• the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owastand.display_standard_group?p_toc_level=1&p_part_number=1910;

• APIC—http://www.apic.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Practice;

• the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America—http://www.shea-online.org/;

• AORN—http://www.aorn.org/PracticeResources; and

• the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation—http://www.aami.org/standards/smo.html.




Typically hospital staffing ratios for infection preventionists are one to every 150 to 200 beds. The ASC administrator should determine the facility's needs based not only on the number of ORs or postanesthesia care unit beds within the facility, but also on
• the complexity of the organization;

• characteristics of the patient population seen at the health care facility;

• the unique or urgent needs of the health care facility;

• the scope of the existing infection control program; and

• tools available to assist the infection preventionist in performing essential tasks (eg, electronic tracking, electronic medical records).
