AORN Leadership Conference Building Authentic Leaders: A Partnership for Success



July 21–23, 2006



Denver Marriott City Center, Denver



Authenticity means being genuine. Being an authentic leader is about being true to yourself and your values. Perioperative nurses are challenged daily by the issues they face, and they must become authentic leaders to successfully rise above those challenges.

This conference will focus on creating partnerships both inside and outside of the nursing profession that support the ongoing development of current and future nurse leaders in professional and volunteer settings. By sharing experiences, developing mentoring relationships, and committing to personal development, participants will come away with practical strategies to assume new and expanded roles and responsibilities, allowing them to understand how to make their visions become reality at this critical time in health care.

This year, the leadership program will feature two educational tracks to meet the needs of executive and association nurse leaders. For more information or to register, visit http://www.aorn.org/events.
