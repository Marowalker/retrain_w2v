I am writing in reference to the Clinical Issues response on the topic of “Implementing droplet precautions” (January 2011, Vol 93, No 1). Near the end of the response was the statement, “For a patient with Staphylococcus aureus in the nares, the health care provider or visitor should place a mask on his or her face within 4 feet of the patient.”

 is cited as the source of the information for the response. However, it is concerning that the information was not applied correctly in response to the droplet precautions question in distinguishing S aureus colonization from active infection.

In Appendix A of the CDC document, “Type and duration of precautions recommended for selected infections and conditions,” S aureus is listed as requiring standard precautions.

(p108) Other portions of the document state the following:
Page 15: I.B.3. Modes of transmission
Several classes of pathogens can cause infection, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and prions. The modes of transmission vary by type of organism and some infectious agents may be transmitted by more than one route: some are transmitted primarily by direct or indirect contact, (e.g., Herpes simplex virus [HSV], respiratory syncytial virus, Staphylococcus aureus), others by the droplet, (e.g., influenza virus, B. pertussis) or airborne routes (e.g., M. tuberculosis).




Page 18: Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis110, influenza virus23, adenovirus111, rhinovirus104, Mycoplasma pneumonia112, SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV)21,96,113, group A streptococcus114, and Neisseria meningitidis95,103,115.




Page 17: For example, although S. aureus is transmitted most frequently by the contact route, viral upper respiratory tract infection has been associated with increased dispersal of S. aureus from the nose into the air for a distance of 4 feet under both outbreak and experimental conditions and is known as the “cloud baby” and “cloud adult” phenomenon118‐120.







If Ms Blanchard was specifically referring to the publications of Bassetti, Bischoff, Walter, et al (2005); Eichenwald and Kotsevalov (1960); and Sheretz, Reagan, Hampton, et al (1996), which are cited as references 118‐120 in the CDC document, this might explain why she instructed mask usage for S aureus.

Recommended practices for infection prevention and control do not suggest routinely donning a droplet mask when treating patients with S aureus in the nares. Strong relationships should be formed between OR and infection prevention staff members to provide education, clarification, and guidance regarding isolation precautions. This will reduce transmission of organisms and unnecessary waste of personal protective equipment as well as eliminate confusion with practices.
