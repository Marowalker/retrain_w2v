To the Editor:

As the Chief Medical Officer (RS) and Head of Health Economics and Outcomes Research (DM) for ACELITY, we acknowledge and value addressing the “clinical data gap” in ventral hernia repair.1 We believe it is equally important that studies are conducted and reported with appropriate methodological rigor. The aim of our letter is to provide surgeons and other study reviewers a deeper and clearer understanding of the recently published complex open bioabsorbable reconstruction of the abdominal wall (COBRA) study. In particular, we highlight the limitations of the study design employed, the limitations in the statistical analysis and reporting, and the inappropriateness of the conclusions drawn by the authors. To be clear, W.L. Gore & Associates, the sponsor of The COBRA study, and LifeCell, an ACELITY Company, are competitors, and it would be disingenuous not to explicitly declare this before reviewing the aforementioned study. Our hope is that this critical assessment might assist surgeons in their evaluation of this and future studies.

The stated objective was to evaluate the use and performance of a new tissue reinforcement material. The absence of a control group precludes statements attributing treatment effect to the mesh. In a single-arm trial, evaluating new mesh reinforcement cannot be separated from the surgical treatment effect.2 Other variables, both measured (surgical technique, mesh placement, presence of infection, enrollment criteria, size of wound) and unmeasured (surgeon experience, care pathways, time) all have a substantial effect on response to treatment and importantly are all uncontrolled. As a result, from the outset, the objective of evaluating a new mesh was incongruent with a single-arm design.

The sample size was calculated from a background event rate of 50% recurrence at 2 years, based on the study by de Vries Reilingh et al,3 which recruited patients between 1999 and 2001, a full 12 to 13 years before the COBRA study. Moreover, the defect size was ∼2 times larger in the study by de Vries Reilingh et al. Differences in patient characteristics from the original study, and advances in surgical technique and patient care strategies in the intervening time would suggest that 50% recurrence is inappropriate for the current timeframe and study. This likely underestimates the necessary sample size for an informative study and of its relevance to current practice.

The purpose of statistical inference is to use a sample of patients to draw conclusions about the larger population from which the sample was taken. A commonly reported metric in this regard is the 95% confidence interval (CI), and its absence from Fig. 11 makes interpretation difficult. For example, “a wide confidence interval points to a lack of information” and the potential for overinterpreting these findings.4

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is also critically important, and this study attempted to provide insights in an area of increasing interest in ventral hernia. Analysis of HRQoL presents some unique challenges because multiple instruments are collected at multiple time points; thus, missing data are inevitable. How missing data were handled was not described (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology checklist referred to by this journal),5 nor did the statistical testing methodology consider adjustments for multiple testing and repeated measures over time. In addition, the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) needs to be considered since statistical significance may be so small as to be clinically irrelevant.6 Clinicians are interested in HRQoL that would be considered meaningful or beneficial by the patient.7 Conversely, statistical significance leaves unanswered questions about clinical relevance of the changes. Therefore, the authors missed an opportunity to provide insights regarding changes important to patients. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, as stated earlier, these changes cannot be attributed to any single variable, the mesh in particular.

Inferences and conclusions are inextricably linked to the study design, thus; it is surprising to see statements of comparison with other materials and a failure to recognize differences in patient characteristics, that is, beyond the technique. The defect size in repair of infected or contaminated ventral incisional hernias (RICH) was substantially larger at 236 versus 137 cm2, and 64% (RICH) versus 45% (COBRA) of the patients had a prior recurrent/previous hernia; thus the statement that 1 study had a lower rate compared with the other is overstated and inappropriate. Moreover, attribution of effect to the mesh is incorrect and references to variables not measured are inappropriate extrapolations. Concluding statements that do not reflect the data that was assessed, reach beyond the study design, or extend outside the current body of evidence become a disservice to the surgeons seeking to improve the care of their patients.

Again addressing clinical data gaps is critically important for the surgeons that use these products and those patients who receive them. LifeCell has actively engaged and supported the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative initiative and also championed similar efforts outside of the United States in an effort to develop additional clinical data and understand long-term outcomes in ventral hernia globally. The success of these efforts demands that we not only understand the data, but have keen interest in the methods and their limitations.
