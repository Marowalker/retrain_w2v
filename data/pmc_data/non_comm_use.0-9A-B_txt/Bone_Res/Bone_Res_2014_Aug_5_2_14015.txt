hypoxia-inducible factor 2α
(HIF2α), a critical catabolic
transcription factor stimulating MMP13 expression
during OA, was also upregulated in mice with reduced
EGFR signaling. Taken together, our findings
demonstrate a primarily protective role of EGFR during
OA progression by regulating chondrocyte survival and
cartilage degradation.
==== Body
Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and degenerative disorder of the
joint primarily characterized by the destruction of articular
cartilage. Articular cartilage is predominantly composed of
collagen, proteoglycans and other matrix proteins. Loss of large
proteoglycan, aggrecan, decreases cartilage compressive
stiffness and precedes the damage to the collagen fibrillar
network, which is responsible for tensile properties of the
tissue. The structural and functional integrity of articular
cartilage relies on the balance between anabolic and catabolic
activities of chondrocytes. The pathology of OA in cartilage
involves the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
inflammation, degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by
proteases, chondrocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis.1 Moreover,
the subchondral bone is inevitably altered with cortical plate
thickening, enhanced bone remodeling and osteophyte
formation.2 The past decade has witnessed
significant advances in deciphering the basic mechanism by which
OA develops using genetically modified and surgical animal
models, but there are as yet no disease modifying treatments
available. It remains imperative to understand what drives
cartilage degeneration during OA.

Growth factors, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β),
insulin-like growth factors, bone morphogenic proteins and
fibroblast growth factors, regulate synthesis and maintenance of
cartilage ECM and therefore, play important roles in cartilage
homeostasis and OA development. We recently demonstrated that
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase
receptor, and one of its cognate ligands, TGF-α, are
important for cartilage matrix degradation during endochondral
ossification.3,4 Deficiency of EGFR activity either
globally or specifically in chondrocytes causes expansion of the
hypertrophic zone in the growth plate3,5 and delayed formation of secondary
ossification center in long bones at early postnatal
stage.6 Consistently, TGF-α null mice
exhibited similar developmental phenotypes.4
Mechanistic studies revealed that activation of EGFR signaling
stimulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
including MMP9, 13 and 14, and receptor activator of nuclear
factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in hypertrophic chondrocytes via
β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways, resulting
in increased cartilage matrix degradation by chondrocytes and
osteoclasts at the chondro-osseous junctions.6 EGFR
ligands are membrane-bound proteins requiring ectodomain
shedding to release the functional peptides. The major sheddase
for TGF-α is TNF-α-converting enzyme, also known as
a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17).7 Studies of
cartilage-specific TNF-α-converting enzyme knockout mice
revealed a similar growth plate phenotype, providing further
evidence that EGFR signaling stimulates the degradation of
cartilage matrix.8,9

Since cartilage ECM degradation is a critical step toward OA
pathogenesis, we hypothesized that EGFR and its ligands
constitute another growth factor signaling pathway regulating OA
development. Indeed, previous reports implied that this pathway
might play a catabolic role in OA pathology. It was reported
that the amount of TGF-α is elevated by articular
chondrocytes in experimentally induced OA and human
OA.10,11 Disruption of mitogen-inducible
gene 6 (mig-6), a negative feedback inhibitor
of EGFR activity, resulted in a degenerative joint OA-like
disease in mice.12–14 Moreover, mice
deficient in MMP13 activity either globally15 or
conditionally in chondrocytes16 were protected from OA
development induced by surgery. In the present study, in order
to directly investigate the role of EGFR in OA development, we
performed destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) to induce
OA in mouse models with reduced EGFR activity. This OA surgery
is well characterized and it induces progressive cartilage
degeneration with little synovial inflammation.17
Surprisingly, we found that these mice show more severe
cartilage destruction compared to control mice. Furthermore,
histological analyses revealed that loss of EGFR activity
accelerates chondrocyte apoptosis and increases cartilage matrix
degradation, which coincide with the upregulation of proteinases
(ADAMTS5 and MMP13), and a catabolic transcription factor,
HIF2α. These results uncover an important function of EGFR
in protecting articular cartilage during OA progress and suggest
this protein as a potential target for OA treatment.

Materials and methods
Surgical induction of OA by DMM in mice with deficient
EGFR activity
Two mouse models with deficient EGFR activity were used in
our study. In the first model, mice were heterozygous
for a dominant negative allele of EGFR,
Wa5.18 These mice
(EgfrWa5/+) on a
129S1/SvImJ background were
generated by breeding
EgfrWa5/+ and
wild-type (WT,
Egfr+/+)
mice, and were identified by their wavy hair
appearance. Both
EgfrWa5/+
(n=9) and their WT siblings
(n=10) at 3 months of age
were subjected to DMM surgery as detailed below. In the
second model, WT 129S2 mice were
purchased from Charles River (Malvern, PA, USA) at the
age of 2 months. A month later, they received DMM
surgery followed by either vehicle (0.5% methyl
cellulose, n=8) or gefitinib (100
mg⋅kg−1,
n=9, an EGFR inhibitor; LC
Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) treatment via oral
gavage immediately after surgery, once every other day,
for 12 weeks. In both models, there was no significant
difference in body weight between control and EGFR
deficient group at the beginning of surgery and at 3
months after surgery when the knee joints were
harvested.

Experimental OA was induced by DMM surgery and performed by a
single surgeon (XZ) in these two mouse models as
described previously.17 Only male mice were used
in our study because male 129 mice develop more severe
OA than females.19 Briefly, under general
anesthesia, the right knee joint capsule was exposed
and the medial meniscotibial ligament was transected
under microscope to give destabilization of the medial
meniscus. A sham operation was performed on the left
knee joint in which the ligament was visualized but not
transected. Mice were maintained in their preoperative
groups, allowed unrestricted cage exercise, and were
weighed weekly until they were euthanized 12 weeks
after surgery. All animal works performed in this study
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of Pennsylvania.

Histological analysis of OA cartilage
After euthanasia, bilateral knee joints were harvested free
of soft tissues, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight, decalcified in 0.5
mol⋅L−1 ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (pH 7.4) for 4 weeks at 4
°C and embedded in paraffin. Serial
5-μm-thick sagittal sections were cut across the
medial compartment of the joint. Two sections within
every consecutive six sections were stained with
Safranin O/Fast green and hematoxylin and the one with
better morphology was used for quantification. Each
knee yielded about 15 sections for scoring by two
blinded observers (XZ and ME-I) using modified
Mankin’s methods.20 In brief, each section
was assigned a score, which is the sum of cartilage
structure (0–5), chondrocytes (0–3),
Safranin-O staining (0–5) and tidemark
(0–1). Each knee received a score from the
section with the maximal score. The results of Mankin
score represent the mean of maximal scores in each
group. To characterize the loss of articular cartilage,
cartilage area (total) and Safranin O-stained area
(uncalcified) were outlined and quantified on projected
images of about 15 sections per bone selected as above
followed by averaging. Thickness of each area was
determined by averaging five thicknesses evenly
distributed across the entire cartilage. To quantify
changes in hypertrophic chondrocytes in the
sham-operated knees, the number of hypertrophic
chondrocytes in tibial articular cartilage was counted
based on their morphology (enlarged chondrocyte lacunae
with a lack of Safranin-O stain around a collapsed
cells) and divided by articular cartilage area.

Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining
Serial sections adjacent to those with representative
Safranin O-stained images were dewaxed in xylene and
rehydrated through a graded series of alcohols for
immunohistochemical evaluation. Briefly, after antigen
retrieval with boiling in sodium citrate buffer,
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in 3%
H2O2 for 15 min and washed
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Sections were then
blocked in serum for 30 min followed by incubation with
the primary antibody in humidified chamber at 4 °C
overnight. Biotinylated secondary antibody was added
for 30 min on the second day, followed by an
avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex
according to the manufacturer’s directions
(Vectastain ABC Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, USA). Finally, peroxidase activity was revealed by
immersion in DAB substrate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit
anti-aggrecanase generated-aggrecan neoepitope NITEGE,
rabbit anti-MMP-generated aggrecan-neoepitope DIPEN
(gifts from Dr John S Mort), rabbit anti-MMP13
(ab75606; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit
anti-ADAMTS5 (ab41037; Abcam), rabbit anti-HIF2α
(NB100–122; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO,
USA). TUNEL staining was carried out on paraffin
sections using ApopTag Plus Peroxidase in Situ
Apoptosis Detection Kit (S7101; Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Primary chondrocytes, qRT-PCR and apoptosis assay
Primary epiphyseal chondrocytes were obtained from rat
newborn pups as described previously.3 Cells were
plated at a density of 4×104 per
cm2 in 12-well plates in chondrogenic
medium (DMEM/F12 medium with 5% fetal bovine
serum, 50 µg⋅mL−1 of
L-ascorbic acid, 1%
glutamine, 100 µg⋅mL−1 of
streptomycin and 100 U⋅mL−1 of
penicillin). Four days later, when cells reached
90% confluence, cultures were given fresh medium
overnight before adding 50
ng⋅mL−1 of recombinant
human TGF-α (Pepro-Tech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).
RNA was harvested after 48 h for qRT-PCR. The primer
sequences are: adamts5 (forward
5′-CGTTCCTGCAGTGTCATACCCT-3′, reverse
5′-TTTGACTCCTTTTGCATCGGAC-3′) and
hif2α (forward
5′-GTGGTCTGTGGGCAATCAGAGCG-3′, reverse
5′-GGAGACATGAGGCGGGGTGC-3′).

To study the survival effect of TGF-α, primary rat
chondrocytes were seeded in 12-well plates at
4×104 cells per cm2 and
serum-starved overnight. The next day, cells were
pretreated with either vehicle or 25
ng⋅mL−1 tumor necrosis
factor α (TNF-α) (Pepro-Tech) before the
addition of 50 ng⋅mL−1
TGF-α. Two days later, cells were washed with PBS
and stained with 5
μg⋅mL−1 ethidium
bromide and 5 μg⋅mL−1
acridine orange in 1×PBS as described
previously.21 Apoptotic cells were identified
as cells having condensed chromatin (green at early
apoptotic stage and red at late apoptotic stage).
Living cells had a characteristic green chromatin
staining with a normal morphology of the nucleus. The
number of apoptotic and total cells was counted in
three fields per well under a fluorescence
microscope.

Statistic analysis
All statistical analysis was performed by independent
Student’s t-test assuming equal
variances in each group or two-way analysis of variance
with a Bonferroni’s post hoc
test. For cell culture experiments, all results are
derived from experiments being repeated independently
at least three times. A value of
P<0.05 was considered
significant. All data are expressed as
mean±s.e.m.

Results
Mice with reduced EGFR activity exhibit accelerated OA
development
Two mouse models with reduced EGFR activity were studied. In
the first model, we compared OA development between
Egfrwa5/+ and
their WT siblings after DMM surgery.
Egfrwa5 codes for a
kinase-dead, dominant negative receptor. Mice
homozygous for Wa5 are embryonic
lethal, but the heterozygotes are viable and show no
major pathological changes,18 allowing for long-term
studies. We recently reported that primary chondrocytes
derived from Egfrwa5/+
mice shows a slightly decrease in extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (ERK) phosphorylation after
being treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF)
compared to WT cells, suggesting that the EGFR activity
in chondrocytes from
Egfrwa5/+ mice is
modestly suppressed.6 In the second model, we compared
OA development in WT mice treated with either vehicle
or gefitinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor.22
Previously, we have demonstrated that similar inhibitor
treatment results significant bone loss at both
trabecular and cortical sites in young mice.23

DMM surgery was performed in the right knees of 3-month-old
skeletally mature mice in both models to induce OA. The
left knees received sham operation. Three months after
surgery, knee joints were harvested for histological
analyses. The sham-operated knees appeared normal in
morphology and their Mankin scores representing the
severity of OA were negligible (less than 1) in all
groups (data not shown). In DMM-operated knees, while
WT mice exhibited typical OA features,
EgfrWa5/+ mice
had marked increases in cartilage surface fibrillation,
clefting and erosion down to the tidemark (Figure 1a).
Moreover, total cartilage area and thickness,
particularly the uncalcified area and thickness, at
both medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau
were reduced in
EgfrWa5/+ mice in
comparison with WT mice (Figure 1b). Further scoring by
Mankin’s method revealed significant 19%
and 36% increases of OA scores at medial femoral
condyle and medial tibial plateau, respectively, in
EgfrWa5/+ mice
compared to those in WT mice (Figure 1c).

In gefitinib-treated mice, OA damages on the articular
cartilage was relatively milder than those in
EgfrWa5/+ mice,
but still more severe than their vehicle-treated
controls with increased fibrillation, clefting and
erosion at the surface of articular cartilage (Figure 2a). While
we did not observe overall loss of total articular
cartilage in gefitinib-treated mice, the area and
thickness of uncalcified cartilage were remarkably
decreased in those mice compared to their vehicle
controls (Figure
2b). Mankin scores revealed a significant
28% increase at medial femoral condyle and a trend
of 22% increase at medial tibial plateau in these
mice compared to controls (Figure 2c). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that mice with reduced EGFR
activity exhibit more cartilage destruction and
accelerated OA progression.

Chondrocyte hypertrophy is routinely seen in the development
of osteoarthritis. Since our previous work demonstrated
that EGFR deficiency induces expansion of the
hypertrophic zone of the growth plate in young rats and
neonatal mice,3 we quantified the number of
hypertrophic chondrocytes in the articular cartilage
and normalized it against the total cartilage area. In
the sham-operated contralateral joints, we observed a
significant 111% increase of hypertrophic
chondrocytes in
EgfrWa5/+ mice
(WT: 0.12±0.03 cells per mm2;
EgfrWa5/+:
0.25±0.02 cells per mm2,
n=5 in each group,
P=0.01, Figure 3a) and a similar trend of
increase in gefitinib-treated mice (vehicle-treated:
0.19±0.02 cells per mm2;
gefitinib-treated: 0.24±0.03 cells per
mm2, n=5 in each
group, P=0.17, Figure 3b) compared
to their respective controls. We found that it was
difficult to perform similar measurement at the DMM
knees because of severe erosion and/or loss of
articular cartilage in the EGFR deficient group. These
findings indicate that EGFR prevents chondrocyte
hypertrophy and may explain why mice with reduced EGFR
signaling are predisposed to the development of
osteoarthritis.

Reduced EGFR activity promotes apoptosis in cartilage
chondrocytes after DMM surgery
Hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo cell death and are replaced
by bone in the process of endochondral ossification.
However, this process at the articular surface could
lead to osteoarthritis. Chondrocyte apoptosis has been
observed during OA progression and the apoptotic rate
is positively correlated with the severity of cartilage
damage.24,25 Indeed, the contribution of
apoptosis to OA was further demonstrated by using
caspase inhibitors, which block cell death and decrease
severity of cartilage lesions in posttraumatic
OA.26 EGFR has multifaceted actions on
cells from a variety of tissues and is capable of
regulating their proliferation, differentiation,
survival, migration, and adhesion. To investigate the
role of EGFR in chondrocyte apoptosis during OA
development, TUNEL staining was performed on knee
joints at 3 months post-surgery in mouse models with
reduced EGFR activity. In DMM-operated knees from
control mice, only 8%–12% of
chondrocytes in articular cartilage underwent apoptosis
and most of these apoptotic chondrocytes were located
in the calcified zone (Figure 4a and 4b). In contrast, 30%
and 24% of chondrocytes in DMM-operated knees from
Egfrwa5/+ mice
and gefitinib-treated mice, respectively, were
TUNEL-positive and many of them extended into the
middle and deep zones (Figure 4a and 4b), suggesting that EGFR
protects chondrocytes from OA-induced cell death.

To confirm this finding in vitro, we
isolated epiphyseal chondrocytes from neonatal pups and
used serum starvation together with TNF-α, a
pro-inflammatory cytokine and a well-known inducer of
chondrocyte apoptosis in OA,27 to induce cell death in
these cells. Ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining
showed that removal of serum alone increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells from 2% to 14%
and that addition of TNF-α further elevated it to
21% (Figure
4c). However, cotreatment with TGF-α
completely abrogated the apoptotic signals of serum
depletion and TNF-α, reducing the percentage of
apoptotic cells to the level similar to those grown in
normal serum-containing medium (Figure 4c). Taken together, these
in vivo and in
vitro results clearly indicate that EGFR
transduces survival signals to chondrocytes during OA
progression.

Aggrecan degradation is accelerated in OA knee joints
from mice with reduced EGFR activity
Proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan weakens the cartilage matrix
and is a key event in OA pathogenesis.28,29 Next, we
examined aggrecan degradation products in articular
cartilage after DMM surgery by immunohistochemistry.
Staining of aggrecan-neoepitopes NITEGE
(aggrecanase-generated aggrecan cleavage fragment) and
DIPEN (MMP-generated aggrecan cleavage fragment) showed
that aggrecan degradation products generated by either
aggrecanases or MMPs were significantly enhanced in
both femoral and tibial articular cartilage areas in
EgfrWa5/+ mice
and gefitinib-treated mice compared to their respective
control mice (Figure
5). These results are in line with much
more severe loss of Safranin O staining observed in
knee joints of mice with reduced EGFR activity (Figure 1a and 2a), indicating
that activation of EGFR signaling pathway suppresses
cartilage matrix degradation during OA development.

ADAMTS5 is the major aggrecanase in mouse cartilage and
deletion of this proteinase blocks cartilage
degradation and prevents OA progression.30,31
Immunostaining revealed that ADAMTS5 amounts were
markedly increased in articular cartilage after DMM
surgery in both mouse models with reduced EGFR
activity, compared to those in their respective control
mice (Figure 6a and 6b,
right panels). Similar observations were
also obtained in sham-operated knees (Figure 6a and 6b, left
panels), implying that EGFR signaling
regulates adamts5 expression in
chondrocytes. Indeed, qRT-PCR experiment with primary
chondrocytes further demonstrated that activation of
EGFR in chondrocytes inhibits the mRNA expression of
adamts5 (Figure 6c).

MMP13 is another critical proteinase responsible for
cartilage degradation during OA development.15,16,32 Our
previous work found that activation of EGFR signaling
induces Mmp13 expression in
chondrocytes, while inhibition of EGFR signal by
gefitinib attenuates its expression in the growth
plate.3 Immunostaining of MMP13 was weak
and mostly located below the tidemark in sham-operated
knees. In line with the above growth plate results, we
found that MMP13 amount was further reduced in
articular cartilage from
EgfrWa5/+ mice
and gefitinib-treated mice (Figure 6a and 6b, left panels). In
contrast, MMP13 immunostaining occurred in the
uncalcified cartilage above the tide marker in DMM knee
joints of EgfrWa5/+ mice and
gefitinib-treated mice and its amounts in those mice
were significantly elevated compared to their
respective control mice (Figure 6a and 6b, right panels). Taken
together, our results indicate that inhibition of EGFR
signaling promotes aggrecan degradation during OA
development by increasing the amounts of important
catabolic enzymes, such as ADAMTS5 and MMP13.

To understand the mechanism for the opposite regulation of
Mmp13 expression by EGFR in sham-
and DMM-operated knee joints, we next analyzed the
expression of hif2a, a transcription
factor highly expressed in OA development and essential
for Mmp13 expression in
chondrocytes,33–35 in the
articular cartilage of those mouse models after DMM
surgery. Immunostaining revealed a considerably
increased number of HIF2α-positive cells in
articular cartilage from
EgfrWa5/+ and
gefitinib-treated mice at 12 weeks after surgery,
compared to their respective control mice (Figure 7a and 7b).
To confirm these in vivo results, we
evaluated the regulation of HIF2α expression by
EGFR signaling in primary epiphyseal chondrocytes
culture. qRT-PCR demonstrated that TGF-α
significantly decreased hif2α expression in
primary chondrocytes (Figure 7c). Hence, our results suggest
that one mechanism for EGFR to suppress
Mmp13 expression is likely
through inhibiting hif2α expression during OA
progression. In normal knees, since the basal level of
HIF2α is very low in the cartilage,34 EGFR
signaling must use alternative transcription factor(s)
to activate the expression of
Mmp13.

Discussion
The present study identifies a novel role of EGFR signaling in
articular cartilage homeostasis and OA progression. We
demonstrated that a genetically modified mouse model
(EgfrWa5/+ ) and
a pharmacological mouse model (gefitinib treatment), both of
which have reduced EGFR activity, exhibit accelerated articular
cartilage destruction in knee joints after surgical induction of
OA. This observation is correlated with increased chondrocyte
apoptosis and aggrecan degradation. Further mechanistic studies
suggest that this is likely due to augmented expression of
catabolic proteinases (ADAMTS5 and MMP13) and a transcription
factor (HIF2α) targeting cartilage matrix degradation
after suppressing EGFR activity.

Our findings initially appeared surprising to us because they are not
consistent with our previous conclusion that chondrogenic EGFR
signaling stimulates cartilage ECM degradation by upregulating
MMPs and stimulating osteoclastogenesis at the chondro-osseous
junction at postnatal developmental stage.3 However,
different from metabolically active epiphyseal chondrocytes at
developmental stage, chondrocytes in adult cartilage are
normally quiescent with very low activities of synthesizing and
degrading cartilage matrix. In response to mechanical stress and
pro-inflammatory cytokines, cartilage homeostasis is disrupted
with increased ECM remodeling, hypertrophy-like maturation,
cartilage calcification and chondrocyte apoptosis. Therefore,
both anabolic and catabolic pathways are elevated during OA
progression and imbalance between these two pathways toward more
catabolic activity leads to this debilitating joint disease.
Indeed, we and others have found that activating EGFR signaling
executes both anabolic and catabolic actions on chondrocytes. It
has been recognized for a long time that EGF is a potent mitogen
for cultured chondrocytes.36,37 Interestingly, recent studies
with either limb or cartilage targeted deletion of the
intracellular EGFR inhibitor mig-6 revealed
remarkably thickened articular cartilage in those mice at early
adult stage due to enhanced chondrocyte proliferation.12,13 Although
we did not notice a reduction in cartilage thickness in the
sham-operated knees in mice with reduced EGFR activity, a close
examination did reveal an increase in the number of hypertrophic
chondrocytes, suggesting that EGFR prevents chondrocyte
hypertrophy. Together with our data that EGFR signaling prevents
chondrocyte apoptosis both in vitro and
in vivo, these findings demonstrate a
strong anabolic role of EGFR signaling in articular cartilage by
increasing the number of articular chondrocytes, particularly
proliferative and undifferentiated chondrocytes, which
eventually leads to more cartilage matrix synthesis. Meanwhile,
activating EGFR signaling transduces strong catabolic signals to
chondrocytes, such as enhancing the expression of MMPs and
RANKL3,4,9 and stimulating cartilage ECM
degradation.3,4 Hence, we propose that the final
outcomes in terms of OA progression in mouse with altered EGFR
activity is combined effects of both anabolic and catabolic
actions of EGFR pathway determined by the level of EGFR
activity. According to this hypothesis, the severe OA phenotypes
observed in mig-6 knockout mice is likely due
to highly elevated EGFR activity. Note that our
EgfrWa5/+ mouse
model has modest decrease in chondrogenic EGFR activity compared
to WT mice while a chondrogenic EGFR knockout mouse model
(col2-cre EgfrWa5/flox) we
established previously has more drastic decrease in EGFR
activity.6 We are currently studying the OA
progression in this mouse model.

Excessive proteolysis has long been recognized as a major contributory
factor to cartilage matrix degradation in OA. A variety of
proteases have been implicated, ranging from lysosomal cysteine
proteases to MMP family members. Among them, ADAMTS5 and MMP13
are the most critical ones in mediating cartilage ECM
degradation because their expression is greatly enhanced in
osteoarthritic knees38–41
and because mice deficient in either ADAMTS5 or MMP13 have
diminished OA progression after DMM surgery.15,16,30,42
Interestingly, while ADAMTS5 amounts were similarly increased in
both sham and DMM knee joints from mice with reduced EGFR
activity, MMP13 amounts were decreased in sham knees, which is
consistent with our previous report that EGFR signaling
stimulates MMP13 expression in chondrocytes, but were increased
in DMM knee joints from mice with reduced EGFR activity compared
to their controls. The apparent contradiction could be explained
by enhanced hif2α expression in DMM knee
joints after suppression of EGFR activity. Previous
reports33–35 have
shown that HIF2α is a major regulator for
Mmp13 but not adamts5
genes in chondrocytes. Elevated HIF2α amount thus
surpasses the other pathway(s) which mediates the stimulatory
effect of EGFR signaling on Mmp13
expression.

In conclusion, in the present study, we provide the first direct
evidence for the involvement of EGFR signaling in the OA
development. Modestly decreased EGFR activity in our two mouse
models accelerates articular cartilage destruction, which is
associated with increased chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage
matrix degradation by ADAMTS5 and MMP13. This study lays the
groundwork for understanding the role of EGFR and its cognate
ligands in the maintenance of articular cartilage and in the
pathogenesis of OA. Further studies to maximize its anabolic
actions while minimizing its catabolic actions in cartilage will
shed light on targeting this novel pathway in OA treatment.

osteoarthritis progression after DMM surgery.
(a) Representative Safranin O/Fast
Green staining images of mouse knee joints show
increased articular cartilage degradation in
gefitinib-treated mice 3 months after DMM surgery.
Bottom panels are magnified images of top panels.
(b) Total articular cartilage,
uncalcified articular cartilage, and their respective
thickness were quantified at both femoral condyle and
tibial plateau regions. (c) Mankin score
graded by blinded observers confirmed more articular
cartilage destruction in gefitinib-treated mice
(n=9) compared to
vehicle-treated (n=8) mice after
DMM surgery. * P<0.05.

Figure 3 Mice with reduced EGFR activity have more hypertrophic
chondrocytes in the articular cartilage. Representative
Safranin O/Fast Green staining images of sham-operated
tibial plateau from
EgfrWa5/+ mice

(b) and their respective
controls.

Figure 4 EGFR signaling protects articular chondrocytes from
OA-induced apoptosis. (a) TUNEL staining
showed increased number of apoptotic chondrocytes in
knee joints from
EgfrWa5/+ mice at
3 months post-surgery compared to that from WT mice.
The percentage of TUNEL-positive chondrocytes was
quantified (n=4 in each group,
right panel). ⋆⋆⋆
P<0.001. (b) The
same TUNEL staining was performed with gefitinib- and
vehicle-treated mice and quantification showed similar
results (n=4 in each group, right panel).

(c) TGF-α, an EGFR ligand,
suppresses chondrocyte apoptosis induced by serum
depletion and TNF-α. Primary chondrocytes were
serum starved for 1 day followed by addition of
10% serum (FBS), vehicle (con), 50
ng⋅mL−1 TGF-α, 25
ng⋅mL−1 TNF-α and
TNF-α plus TGF-α. Two days later, ethidium
bromide/acridine orange staining was performed to
quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells (bottom
panel). Arrow points to a late apoptotic cell. ss,

Figure 5 Aggrecan degradation is elevated in osteoarthritic cartilage
from mice with reduced EGFR activity.
Immunohistological assay revealed increased amounts of
degraded aggrecan products generated either by
aggrecanases (top panels) or by MMPs (bottom panels) in
knee joints from WT and
EgfrWa5/+ mice
(a) and vehicle- and
gefitinib-treated mice (b) after DMM
surgery.

Figure 6 The protein amounts of ADAMTS5 and MMP13 are increased in
osteoarthritic cartilage from mice with reduced EGFR
activity. (a, b)
Immunostaining of ADAMTS5 and MMP13 in sham- (left
panels) and DMM-operated (right panels) knee joints
from WT and EgfrWa5/+
mice (a) and vehicle- and
gefitinib-treated mice (b). For ADAMTS5,
we observed increased staining in both sham and DMM
knees from mice with reduced EGFR activity. However,
for MMP13, we observed decreased staining in sham knees
but increased staining in DMM knees from mice with
reduced EGFR activity. The percentages of ADAMTS5- and
MMP13-positive chondrocytes were quantified. *

qRT-PCR shows that EGFR signaling inhibits chondrogenic
adamts5 expression. Primary
chondrocytes were serum starved overnight, treated with
vehicle (control) or TGF-α (50
ng⋅mL−1) for 1 day, and
harvested for mRNA quantification. **
