been shown to improve osteoblastic proliferation and mineralization, advancing
bone tissue engineering. Among these factors, both polydopamine (PDA) and
dopamine (DA) monomer have recently been reported to increase osteoblast
proliferation and mineralization in vitro. Although a
well-characterized neurotransmitter, DA’s role in the bone is unknown. We
hypothesize that DA can directly act on osteoblasts, and examined whether
osteoblasts express DA receptors that respond to exogenous DA. mRNAs and protein
cell lysates were obtained from MC3T3-E1 cells during osteogenic differentiation
phase. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis
were used to examine the expression of DA receptors, D1–D5. Dose-response
effect and time course of DA treatment on cell proliferation, mineralization,
and osteogenic differentiation were investigated at pre-determined days.
Real-time PCR was performed to investigate whether DA affects osteogenic gene
expression (ALP, BSP, OC, OSX, RUNX2, and Collagen1a2) with or without receptor
antagonists (SCH233390 and GR103691). Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical
analysis. All five DA receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) mRNAs and proteins were
expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. DA treatment increased cell proliferation for up to
7 days (P < 0.05). Osteogenic mineralization was significantly
greater in the DA-treated group than control group (P < 0.05).
Finally, expression of all the osteogenic genes was inhibited by DA receptor
antagonists for D1, D3, and D5. Our findings suggest that MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts
express functional DA receptors that enhance proliferation and mineralization.
PDA is not biologically inert and has important implications in orthopedic
applications. Furthermore, osteoblast differentiation might be regulated by the
nervous system, presumably during bone development, remodeling, or repair.
==== Body
Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for tissue regeneration require mechanical
strength and the desired environment for seeded cells to gain functionality in
the scaffold materials. Scaffolds that release soluble bioactive factors
achieved higher success rates of tissue regeneration compared to direct delivery
of signal molecules into the regeneration site or on a porous
scaffold.1 Oxidative
polymerization of dopamine (DA) was recently used in our laboratory to increase
the mechanical property of 3D bone scaffolds made of Hydroxyapatite-Gelatin
Calcium Silicate (HGCS) by providing an interpenetrating polydopamine (PDA)
network (HGCS-PDA).2

Surface modification with PDA, inspired by marine bivalve mollusks and mussels,
has been used to promote cell adhesion in wet environments and on surfaces
resistant to cell adhesion.3 Under
alkaline condition, the hydroxyl or C=O groups in 1,2-dihydroxybenzene oxidize
to Quinone and induce polymerization of the DA. This reaction has been applied
to form a thin layer coating the substrates by covalent bond, hydrogen bond, and
metal chelation.4

The adhesion of mouse pre-osteoblasts MC3T3-E1 cells were significantly improved
on the surface of PDA modified materials such as polyethylene,
polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone, and polydimethylsiloxane.5–7 Additionally, PDA
coating on substrates such as titanium and electrospun polymers has been shown
to promote osteogenic differentiation.8,9 While these exciting
results have improved cell adhesion, they are restricted to two-dimensional
surface coating.

We were the first to report the amalgamation of PDA in a 3D composite structure
instead of a surface coating. The use of PDA in our HGCS-PDA substrate increased
the mechanical strength by 30% compared to scaffolds with no DA. Surprisingly,
the HGCS-PDA scaffold was found to release DA into the surrounding liquid
environment, which was detected by using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC).2 In general, DA is
known to function as a neurotransmitter in neurons by binding to D1 and D2 types
of DA receptors. While signals from D1-type receptors transduce through G
proteins to activate adenylyl cyclase, forming cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) and activating protein kinase A (PKA), D2-type receptors block this
signaling by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase.10

Recent data suggest that osteoblasts might respond to neurotransmitters. For
instance, sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers directly transduce chemical
messenger to the bone and periosteum.11 Also, the finding of nerve endings directly contacted
with bone cells may have possible effect on the bone remodeling. Axons
containing catecholamine were found near osteoblasts in
vivo.12 The presence of
beta adrenergic receptors in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts further support
the existence of receptors for neurotransmitters and neuropeptide from sensory
and sympathetic nerve fibers.13
Finally, many studies showed that damaged or missing sympathetic nerves result
in abnormal bone formation and bone mass.14 Therefore, these findings implicate that osteoblasts may
respond to neurotransmitters such as DA.

In addition to the DA effects on osteoblasts, there were relevant evidences of DA
receptor and DA active transporter (DAT) can also influence osteogenic activity.
Hanami et al. have demonstrated that D2-like DA receptor signaling
suppressed human osteoclastogenesis.15
Furthermore, Bliziotes et al. have shown mice deleted for DAT gene
exhibit reduced bone mass.16 These
findings indicate that dopaminergic signaling plays an important role in bone
homeostasis via direct effects upon osteoclast differentiation and the deletion
of the DAT gene results in deficiencies in skeletal structure and integrity.

To determine whether DA can influence osteoblast proliferation and
differentiation, we hypothesize osteoblasts may express DA receptors and respond
to the DA. To test the hypothesis, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells were examined for
DA receptor expression using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Potential effects
of the DA on osteogenic gene expression, proliferation, and mineralization were
also investigated.

Materials and methods
Osteoblasts cultures
MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were obtained from ATCC (Subclone 14,
CRL-2594).17 The cells
were cultured and expanded in growth media (alpha minimal essential medium
(α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and
streptomycin) and were differentiated with growth media supplemented with 10
mmol·L−1 beta glycerophosphate and 0.2
mmol·L−1 ascorbic acid at 37°C under 5%
CO2. The media was changed every 3 days.

RT-PCR for DA receptor expression
Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells by following the
instructions from QiagenRNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and
then the RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an QuantiTect Reverse
Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Oligonucleotide primers for
the PCR were designed for mouse DA receptors as described in Table 1. For the first step of the PCR, the
conditions for the DA receptors and GAPDH were 29 cycles of denaturation (at
94°C for 40 seconds), annealing (at 55°C for 45 seconds), and
extension (at 72°C for 40 seconds), followed by a final 5-minute
extension at 72°C. RNAs extracted from fresh mouse brain were used as a
control to identify the correct size of DA mRNAs from MC3T3-E1 cells. To
reduce non-specific binding in PCR products, nested PCR was performed. A 1
µL of amplified PCR products (D1–D5 and GAPDH) from the first
step was used as a template to initiate another PCR reaction, which was
performed under the same conditions as first step except that different
primers were used for the nested PCR (Table 1).
The PCR products from both first and second steps were separated by
electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing GelRed Nucleic Acid
Stain (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA), and the image was captured by
ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Western blot analysis for DA receptors
MC3T3-E1 cells under osteogenic differentiation for 0, 4, 7, and 14 days were
lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mmol·L−1 Tris-HCl:
pH 8.0, 5 mmol·L−1 EDTA, 150
mmol·L−1 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1
mmol·L−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
phosphatase & protease inhibitor cocktail) for 10 minutes. After
centrifugation at 14 000 rpm·min−1, supernatant was
collected as a whole-cell lysate.

Mouse brain tissue was used as positive control. All animal works were
performed with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval
at Duke University. Total protein was measured by using Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysate
from each group containing 15 μg of protein was loaded to and
separated through 12% NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) by using Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). After blocking for 30 minutes, the membrane was incubated
overnight at 4°C with the anti-DA receptors 1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), 2 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), 3 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem,
Israel), 4 and 5 (Abcam®, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies (1:500 ratio).
After subsequent washing, the membrane was incubated for 1 hour with
secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (Milipore, Billerica, MA, USA),
rewashed, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). The band images were captured by
ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Beta actin (Abcam®,
Cambridge, MA, USA) was used as a loading control and for normalization.

Optimization of DA concentration
MC3T3-E1 cells (2 × 105 per 35 mm dish) were maintained in
the growth media for 24 hour. DA was dissolved in molecular grade ultrapure
water (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA, USA) and filter through 0.2
µmol·L−1 pore syringe filters. The cells
were then exposed to DA in different final concentrations (0, 50, 100, and
200 µmol·L−1) for 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours,
respectively.

The dose and time effect of DA on MC3T3-E1 cells were determined with
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium
salt (MTS) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(CellTiter96; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, 40 µL of MTS reagent
in 500 µL of basal media was added to the cells in each dish at the end
of the designed cultivation period and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.
Aliquots of 100 µL were removed for analysis. Colored formazan products
were quantified by measuring absorbance at 490 nm using a microplate reader
(Bio-Rad Model 550, Life Science Research, Hercules, CA, USA). Three samples
were tested with triplicate at each time point for each group.

Proliferation assay
MC3T3-E1 cells (5 × 104 cells per 35 mm dish) were seeded and
attached overnight, and then stimulated with DA. The cells were supplied
with fresh culture media containing 50 µmol·L−1
of DA every 48 hours during the culture period. Cell proliferation also was
carried out under low FBS (3%) containing growth media. After 1, 3, 5, and 7
days in culture, the absorbance of MTS solution from each well was measured
at 490 nm using a microplate reader. For those proliferating cells,
5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU: Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,
USA) was incorporated with cells for 2 hours and detected using anti-BrdU
antibody as instructed by company protocol.

Mineralization assay with cetylpyridiniumchloride
quantitation
MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded (2 × 105 cells per 35 mm dish) and
supplied with fresh osteogenic media every 3 days. A total of four groups
were examined for mineral formation: the cells cultured with osteogenic
media, osteogenic media containing 50 µmol·L−1
DA, growth media containing 50 µmol·L−1 DA, and
growth media only. A control group without cells was also examined. After 7,
14, 18, and 21 days the cells were fixed with 75% cold ethanol for 30
minutes and then stained with 1% Alizarin Red (Acros Organics, Geel,
Belgium) solution (pH 4.2) for 10 minutes at RT. The cells were rinsed with
dH2O six times and air dried. Color images of the mineral
deposition were acquired using an Olympus DP12 camera (Olympus Optical Co.
Ltd, Japan) attached to a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope (Nikon Instruments,
Melville, NY, USA). To quantify Alizarin Red S-retained minerals, 10% (v/w)
cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in sodium
phosphate was used and measured at 570 nm.

Real-time PCR for osteogenic gene expression with DA receptor
blockers
MC3T3-E1 cells were culture with both growth and osteogenic media for 0, 4,
and 7 days. DA receptor antagonists SCH233390 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol,
UK) for D1 and D5 and GR103691 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) for D3 was
treated in each 35 mm dish with final concentration of 1
mmol·L−1 and 0.5 mmol·L−1,
respectively. After 30 minutes of antagonists treatment, DA solution was
added directly to the experimental group for a final concentration of 50
µmol·L−1. cDNA was synthesized as previously
described in RT-PCR. Real-time PCR was performed using the 7200 Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA, USA) to determine
mRNA expression of each osteogenic specific genes (Table
2) after DA treatment. The control was a non-DA-treated
culture.

Statistics
All data were presented in terms of mean ± SD and P value less
than 0.05 was considered significant. While comparison of two groups was
made by paired t-test, comparison within groups was made by
ANOVA.

Results
Expression of DA receptor genes in MC3T3-E1 cells
Nested polymerase chain reaction (Nested PCR; primers in Table 1), showed clear nested PCR bands of all five DA
receptors without any nonspecific bands (Figure
1). The size of PCR products from both mouse brain and MC3T3-E1
cells were found to be identical.18

Western blot analysis of DA receptors in MC3T3-E1 cells
The band size of DA receptors of mouse brain and the MC3T3-E1 cells was
almost identical, and the band specificity against antibodies was also high
in both groups (Figure 2). Antibodies against
D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptor proteins recognized band size around 70, 50,
40, 70, and 50 kD respectively in both mouse brain and MC3T3-E cells.
Although all five DA receptor expressions were clearly detected on day 0,
day 4, day 7, and day 14, there is not much changes in the level of
expression over time.

Optimization of DA treatment
DA concentration was optimized not only to prevent cell death due to overdose
but also for a stimulatory effect on MC3T3-E1 cells. This was accomplished
by investigating the effect of various DA concentrations as well as length
of DA treatment. As illustrated in Figure 3, the
highest OD values for the cells that were exposed at each time and dose are
0.32 ± 0.04 in 24 hours at the concentration of 100
µmol·L−1, 0.46 ± 0.02 in 36 hours with
50 µmol·L−1, 0.51 ± 0.02 in 48 hours with
50 µmol·L−1, and 0.66 ± 0.02 with 0
µmol·L−1 in 72 hours (data not shown here).
Collectively, the highest OD value (0.51 ± 0.02) was acquired for the
cells treated with 50 µmol·L−1 of DA for 48
hours, which is considered as the most effective condition for studies less
than 72 hours. After the treatment of cells with 100 and 200
µmol·L−1 of DA for 36 and 48 hours, we could
observe color darkening in culture media. Most of the cells that were
treated with higher than 100 µmol·L−1 of DA
died. Thus, the 50 µmol·L−1 of DA was used for
experiments on cell proliferation up to 7 days of culture described
below.

Effect of DA on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation
Based on the DA optimization data, MC3T3-E1 cells were supplied with fresh
media (10% FBS) containing 50 µmol·L−1 DA every
48 hours for 7 days. A significant difference in growth was observed up to
day 4 between the DA-treated and non-treated cells (Figure 4a). The cell number in both groups increased
insignificantly at almost the same rate up to day 7. DA treatment provided
higher growth in the treated group than in the non-treated group only from
day 1 to day 4. The value of OD measurement in the DA-treated group (0.76
± 0.05) on day 3 was significantly higher than that of the non-treated
group (0.65 ± 0.02, P < 0.05). However,
MC3T3-E1 cells in both DA-treated and non-treated media represented almost
the same growth rate from day 4 to day 7 without significant difference in
the proliferation rate (P > 0.05). Beginning with cell density
of 50 000 the confluent after 7 days of culture reached the plateau of the
growth curve in both groups. Compared with the control cells lacking DA
treatment, the MC3T3-E1 cells displayed that the enhanced proliferation by
the DA (50 µmol·L−1) treatment up to 7 days. In
addition, BrdU assay indicated higher number of BrdU+ cells in
DA-treated group on day 1 but will have similar number of BrdU+
cells on days 3, 5, and 7 (Figure 4c).

MC3T3-E1 cells were supplied with media (3% FBS) containing 50
µmol·L−1 DA every 48 hours for 7 days.
Significant differences in DA-treated cells on both days 3 and 5 were
observed compared to non-treated cells. Although the overall cell growth in
3% serum was slower than in 10% serum, DA treatment on the cells clearly
showed more effective proliferation than the cells without DA in 3% serum
condition (Figure 4b).

Effect of DA on mineralization
Bone mineralization resulting from calcium deposition is known as a late
marker in osteogenic differentiation. Most mineralization was initiated
after 7 days, the results on days 10, 14, 18, and 21 (Figure 5). From the scanned image of mineralization (Figure 5a), the DA-treated group (50
µmol·L−1) showed higher levels of
mineralization as shown by a darker color, rougher particles and widely
branched deposits in comparison with that in the non-treated group. The
difference in mineralization was most significant after 18 days between the
two groups. After 21 days, difference in mineralization could not be
assessed due to over-deposition of minerals. The negative control group
without DA showed no mineral deposits even after 21 days. The mineralization
was induced using DA treated on the cells under non-osteogenic media.
Although no distinct mineral deposits were observed until 14 days, only
small, weakly stained mineral particles were observed 21 days, which was
different than the mineral deposits in the other two groups under osteogenic
media. The shape of the mineral nodules after DA treatment indicated the
larger average size of nodules (>1 mm in diameter) and more branched with
neighboring nodules than those in the group without DA treatment.

Both CPC (Figure 5b) and Image J analysis
(Figure 5c) extraction indicated an
increased area of calcium nodules in the DA-treated group compared with the
non-treated group on days 10, 14, 18, and 21. Mineralization was
significantly higher at the 10th, 14th, and 18th days for the DA-treated
group, compared to the non-treated group. However, the level of
mineralization was just little higher on the 21st day of differentiation
with DA.

Effect of DA on osteogenic gene expression with receptor
antagonists
To compare the osteogenic gene expression, the MC3T3-E1 cell culture was
categorized as (i) cells cultured in growth media with or without DA, (ii)
the cells cultured in osteogenic media with or without DA, and (iii) the
cells blocked by antagonists and then cultured in both growth and osteogenic
media with DA. Any elevated mRNA expression of osteogenic genes was
considered to have higher osteogenic potential by the cells.

To confirm that DA treatment enhanced mineralization, we performed real-time
PCR analysis to determine whether osteogenic gene expression is also
increased in MC3T3-E1 cells. Our data showed that the expression of the
osteogenic genes is different in cells with DA treatment than those without
DA in osteogenic and growth media at either day 4 or day 7 (Figure 6).

Osteogenic media-stimulated osteogenic gene expression was higher than the
osteogenic gene expression in growth media on both day 4 and day 7
(P < 0.05). However, the osteogenic gene
expression in osteogenic media showed significant decrease on both day 4 and
day 7 after DA treatment. Particularly, Runx2 gene was suppressed after
blocking with combined antagonists for DA receptors, SCH233390 and GR103691,
while the rest of the genes were elevated level of induction regardless of
the antagonists treatment on day 4. But all the osteogenic genes in
osteogenic media were decreased after antagonists treatment on day 7 except
no obvious difference on OSX gene (Figure
6a).

DA alone induced osteogenic gene expression level. The level of each gene
expression of MC3T3-E1 cells in growth media increased with DA treatment on
either day 4 or day 7 except the collagen 1 gene expression on day 7, which
did not show much effect on its gene expression even after DA treatment. The
gene expression by DA treatment after antagonists treatment was
significantly inhibited by the stimulatory effect of the DA except the
collagen gene at 7 days. In contrast, the DA treatment on the cells cultured
in the osteogenic media significantly reduced all the gene expression at
both day 4 and day 7 (Figure 6b).

Discussion
Although the expression of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors
in osteoblasts was previously reported,17,18 the presence of
DA receptors in osteoblasts has not been discussed. In this study, we found that
DA receptors are expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells and are functional to induced
mineralization. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report that
osteoblasts express DA receptors and the cellular effect of DA treatment. DA
receptors are usually known to have broad expression patterns not only in the
central nervous system (CNS) such as brain and spinal cord but also in the
peripheral nervous system (PNS).19,20 The roles and functions of DA and DA
receptors in osteoblasts are unknown. In addition, there is no report of
osteoblast releasing DA to date. We performed western blotting for tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) expression, which is responsible for catalyzing the conversion
of the amino acid L-tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) for cells
that release DA. However, we did not detect any TH expression in osteoblasts
even though it was detected in brain lysates used as a positive control (data
not shown). The source of DA is likely extracelluar and not from osteoblasts
themselves.

In this study, RT-PCR and western blot analysis were assessed to examine DA
receptor mRNA and protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Surprisingly, all five
DA receptors genes and proteins were expressed as identified by the RT-PCR and
western blot, respectively.

Although we did not measure direct affinity between DA and DA receptors, DA
receptors (D1–D5) are known to be activated by DA with various affinities
ranging from the nanomolar to micromolar range. Different subtypes of DA
receptors vary significantly in their sensitivity to DA agonists and
antagonists. The dissociation constants (Ki values) of the DA agonists
were determined with selective radioligands. According to the reference by the
National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program database
(http://pdsp.med.unc.edu), the Ki values for the five DA
receptors were 130 nmol·L−1 for D1, 598
nmol·L−1 for D2, 32.5 nmol·L−1
for D3, 182.6 nmol·L−1 for D4, and 228
nmol·L−1 for D5.

Plasma concentration of DA in healthy human population is reported to be 21.8
± 9.5 ng·L−1.21 Also, Mayo Clinic Lab reference value shows normal
plasma concentration of DA should be less than 30 pg·mL−1
(=0.196 nmol·L−1). Although physiological DA
concentration is much lower than what we used to stimulate MC3T3-E1 cells, there
is no previous report on DA concentration in bone or DA effects on osteoblastic
cells. Our study shows there was no clear cellular toxicity from DA
concentration with 50 µmol·L−1 on osteoblasts.
Although we stimulate with a higher concentration of DA than the physiological
condition to osteoblasts, our study is limited on in vitro culture
condition, not in vivo physiological conditions. If the cells
stimulated by high concentration of DA can improve osteogenic differentiation
in vitro without toxic effect, we can consider them as good
candidate for bone regeneration in tissue engineering.

There is strong evidence in neuronal cells that DA can cause cytotoxic effects by
both oxidative stress of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) and formation
of hydrogen peroxide.22 Previously
Clement et al. proved that DA-induced cell death is not specific only
for neuronal cells but also for the rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) and
the M14 human melanoma cell line.23
Future dopaminergic toxicity test and apoptosis studies for MC3T3-E1 are
warranted. One of the most reliable methods to detect the apoptotic cells
affected by the DA is caspase activity assay, which detects a relatively early
event in apoptosis. The detection method for caspase is reliable and does not
require a washing step. Although the TUNEL assay is known as the gold standard
to detect apoptosis, TUNEL detects necrotic cells as well. Moreover, it is a
late event in apoptosis so there is a high chance to wash out dead cells during
the staining procedures, which may result in inaccurate quantitation.
It’s also a good way to apply DA antagonists to observe whether it can
prevent MC3T3-E1 cell death at high dosage and this will show the apoptotic
effect is from DA not from something else.

We further characterized the effect of DA on osteogenic activities by assessing
proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and formation of mineralized bone-like
nodules. While seeding with low number of cells (<20 000) can cause both
inaccurate and inconsistent cell seeding, these cells divide rapidly and become
confluent in only a few days. Thus, the initial cell number was optimized as 50
000 cells to allow the cells to be cultured for 7 days to avoid contact
inhibition. Using a low serum medium for proliferation, we clarified the role
that DA plays in promoting proliferation during 7 days of culture. Since FBS
activates cellular mitogenic activity, it is important to test proliferation in
low serum (3%) condition to observe better effect by DA, not by serum. Controls
(no DA) were used and compared the proliferation taking into account the
background response due to the presence of serum proteins in the culture medium.
Proliferating cells were observed using BrdU assay. About 30% of cells were BrdU
positive in each group except in the DA-treated group on day 1. BrdU positive
cell number was higher than that in untreated group. Initially, DA could have an
effect on the cell attachment.

While the nodules formed with DA treatment were larger and more branched, and
connected with neighboring particles, the group without DA treatment showed
smaller nodules that were not connected. Sometimes, discrepancies among the
degree of mineral deposition may be due to differences in the differentiation
stage, cell passage and condition culture period before differentiation
triggered and the time that cells are grown in osteogenic media. Therefore, we
also used growth media, in addition to osteogenic media to confirm the effect of
DA on osteoblasts. Future studies can clarify the molecular mechanism of how DA
stimulates mineralization through DA receptors. In contrast to other research
studies that focused on the effect of cells on the coated substrates, this study
provided clearer insight of the effect of DA on bone cells by adding a known
concentration of DA directly to the culture media.

Real-time PCR was performed to quantify the expression of osteoblast-related
genes (Table 2) in MC3T3-E1 cells after DA treatment
in both growth and osteogenic media. Interestingly, all the genes investigated
were significantly upregulated by culturing in growth media for either day 4 or
day 7. To investigate whether DA affects osteogenic differentiation is specific
via DA receptors, we used DA receptor antagonists SCH233390 (D1 and D5 blocker)
and GR103691 (D3 blocker) to block DA receptors. The results demonstrated that
gene expression, which was stimulated by DA treatment (50
µmol·L−1), was completely blocked by
administration of the antagonists. However, all the gene expression of MC3T3-E1
cells cultured in osteogenic media decreased after DA treatment possibly due to
a chemical reaction between the osteogenic media and DA. The antagonists also
did not block the effect of the DA treatment.

Although gene expression in osteogenic media did not show any DA effects, the
mineralization under osteogenic media was increased by DA. From these results,
our assumption is that DA can directly interact with either
β-glycerophosphate or ascorbic acid during osteogenic differentiation to
decrease gene expression and further studies on the interaction should be
investigated in future experiments. At the same time, DA antagonists also did
not have any effect on most of the osteogenic gene expression in osteogenic
media. One possible assumption is that the binding of the DA antagonists to the
DA receptors might be inhibited by β-glycerophosphate or ascorbic acid.
The other possibility is the reaction of antagonists with
β-glycerophosphate or ascorbic acid changes their chemical conformation
and prevents binding to the receptors. Further chemical analysis will be
required before the osteogenic gene expression study by DA is attempted in
osteogenic media. One limitation of our study is the use of multiple inhibitors
at one time, which does not delineate the role of individual DA receptor. It is
important to investigate the role of each DA receptor antagonist for
confirmation of each DA receptor-mediated biological effects in the future.

In this study, DA receptors were expressed in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts cells and are
functional. Direct administration of DA-promoted cellular proliferation and
mineralization and was confirmed by using specific DA receptor antagonists. Our
findings suggest that DA can enhance bone regeneration, possibly in association
with novel bone scaffold, HGCS-PDA scaffold in bone tissue engineering. Duel
effect of DA on both osteoblasts and HGCS-PDA scaffold may lead to a novel
strategy of bone regeneration for future orthopedic application.

Figure 1 Expression of dopamine (DA) receptor genes in cultured MC3T3‐E1 cells.
Total RNAs extracted from MC3T3‐E1 cells were analyzed by
RT‐PCR using specific primers for each DA receptor (Table 1). The size of the PCR products was analyzed
by electrophoresis compared with mRNAs extracted from mouse brain (Br)
tissue. D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptors were consistently expressed in both
MC3T3‐E1 cells and Br tissue. bp, base pair.

Figure 2 Western blot analysis of DA receptor expression on the MC3T3‐E1
osteoblasts during osteogenic differentiation on days 0, 4, 7, and 14. Br
was used as control to identify the correct size of each DA receptor protein
and binding specificity against each DA receptor antibody. Each loading was
normalized by beta actin and quantified using Image J software. The relative
molecular mass of significant band identified on the blots was labelled on
the right side of blot image.

Figure 3 Optimization of DA concentration and treatment duration on MC3T3‐E1
cells using MTS assay. Total of 50 000 cells per 35 mm dish were seeded
overnight and exposed to various concentrations (0, 50, 100, and 200
µmol·L−1) of dopamine for 24, 36, and 48
hours of culture respectively. Cell proliferation was most effective with 50
µmol·L−1 of DA treatment after 48 hours
(n = 3 measurements from each three independent
samples per group, *P < 0.05 vs.
0 µmol·L−1 dopamine group).

Figure 4 Effect of DA on cell proliferation. MTS proliferation assays were performed
on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 in growth media containing 10% FBS (a) and 3%
FBS (b), respectively. Proliferating cells were detected by BrdU
assay (c), scale: 100 μm. Cells were treated with 50
µmol·L−1 DA on day 0. The medium was changed
every 48 hours with freshly prepared DA solution. The assay was performed in
96‐well plates with n = 3 measurements from each three independent samples per group.

Figure 5 Mineral nodule formation after Alizarin Red S staining and quantification.
(a) DA treatment enhanced mineralization by MC3T3‐E1 cells
cultured with osteogenic media. The level of mineralization was equalized in
both DA‐treated (50 µmol·L−1) and
non‐treated group after 21 days. DA effect was also observed in the
cells cultured with growth media for 21 days forming small minerals. Scale
bar represents 200 μm. (b) Semi‐quantitative analysis of
Alizarin Red S‐stained particles by CPC extraction method. Extracted
solution was measured by the absorbance at 570 nm (n = 6,
*P < 0.05 vs. in osteogenic media without DA,
and †P < 0.05 vs. in growth media without
DA). (c) Image J analysis of the mineral coverage of the culture
dish. Both CPC and Image J analysis yielded similar
results.

Figure 6 The osteogenic gene expression of MC3T3‐E1 cells that were cultured
with/without DA (50 µmol·L−1), as evaluated with
real‐time PCR analysis to detect ALP, BSP, OC, OSX, RUNX2, and
Collagen1a2 genes. Each gene data was presented as fold changes in the
control, dopamine treated, and dopamine treated with antagonists (SCH233390
and GR103691) in growth media (a) and osteogenic media (b).
The real‐time PCR data were normalized with GAPDH expression
(n = 3 per group; *P < 0.05 compared
with control and antagonists treated group at same time point).
