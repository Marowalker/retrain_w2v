resulted in the identification of several skeletal muscle disorders
to be caused by pathologically functioning ion channels
and has led to the term channelopathies. Typical hereditary
muscle channelopa thies are congenital myasthenic syndromes,
non-dystrophic myotonias, periodic paralyses, malignant hyperthermia,
and central core disease. Most muscle channelopathies
are commonly considered to be benign diseases. However, lifethreatening
weakness episodes or progressive permanent weakness
may make these diseases severe, particularly the periodic
paralyses (PP). Even in the typical PP forms characterized by
episodic occurrence of weakness, up to 60% of the patients suffer
from permanent weakness and myopathy with age. In addition,
some PP patients present with a predominant progressive muscle
weakness phenotype. The weakness can be explained by strongly
depolarized fibers that take up sodium and water and that are
electrically inexcitable. Drugs that repolarize the fiber membrane
can restore muscle strength and may prevent progression.

Introduction
Most muscle channelopathies have similar clinical
features: typically the symptoms occur as episodes which
last from minutes to days and show spontaneous and
complete remission and onset in the first or second decade
of life. Frequently the symptoms can be aggravated
by exercise, rest following physical activity, hormones,
mental stress, or certain types of food and drugs. Some
patients show amelioration at the age of 40 or 50 (1).
Therefore muscle channelopathies are commonly considered
to be benign diseases. However, severe muscle stiffness
and transient weakness in some forms of myotonia, and spontaneous attacks of paralysis in PP drastically
reduce the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily
living. The inherent danger of cardiac arrhythmia due to
excessive hypo- or hyperkalemia aggravates the situation
in these patients. Since patients with muscle channelopathies
may not have any interictal features or the weakness
may be misinterpreted, they are often thought to have had
a conversion reaction, and this may cause them to suffer
needlessly. Up to 60% of the periodic paralysis patients
develop a progressive myopathy with age resembling
limb girdle dystrophy. For many patients, misdiagnosis
and disruption of their jobs and of social and family relationships
are even more distressing than physical powerlessness.
Therefore correct diagnosis including molecular
genetic confirmation and proper treatment are mandatory.
This article deals with the various hereditary muscle
channelopthies such as congenital myasthenic syndromes,
non-dystrophic myotonias, periodic paralyses, malignant
hyperthermia, and central core disease. The responsible
genes, the disease pathogenesis and the therapeutical options
are described (Table 1).

Congenital myasthenic syndromes –
not always congenital
Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a heterogeneous
group of inherited disorders with defective
transmission of neuromuscular excitation resulting in
muscle fatigue. Weakness is usually evident at birth or
within the first year or two of life, and is characterized
by feeding difficulties, ptosis, impaired eye movements,
and delayed motor milestones. Strength sometimes improves
during adolescence, and does not exhibit a progressive
course. Reflexes are usually brisk and muscle
wasting does not occur. CMS can lead to congenital arthrogryposis multiplex involving reduced fetal movement
and multiple joint contractures in the neonate. Electromyography
in CMS patients reveals a characteristic decrement
of compound action potential (CMAP) amplitude
on repetitive stimulation (3 Hz). The decrement usually
starts at the second, rarely at the third CMAP, and ends
at the 4th or 5th. After that, the decrement either improves
or remains the same. The reduced transmission is usually
improved by edrophonium. Single fibre recordings show
an increased variability in the synaptic transmission time
(“jitter”) and transmission blocks.

Presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic loss-of-function
proteins
CMS result from defects in presynaptic, synaptic, and
postsynaptic proteins. Presynaptic defects reduce acetylcholine
release and resynthesis due to mutations in the choline acetyltransferase gene (CHAT). Synaptic CMS
are caused by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) deficiency
due to mutations in the COLQ gene encoding the collagenic
tail subunit that mediates AChE insertion into the
synaptic basal lamina. Postsynaptic CMS are caused by
dominant or recessive mutations in the CHRNA1/B1/D/E
genes for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits.
Loss-of-function mutations, most frequently of CHRNE,
lead to compensatory expression of fetal Δ subunits yielding
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complexes which differ
functionally from the adult type (2). Therefore proteins
that anchor or stabilize these subunits are targets
for CMS (3, 4). Mutations in the corresponding genes
RAPSN, MUSK and DOK7 are similarly frequent and
together as frequent as CHRNE mutations. DOK7 and
COLQ mutations should be considered in patients presenting
with proximal weakness and waddling gait and inward rotation of the knees, even in the absence of symptoms
suggesting a possible myasthenia (5). Late onset of
symptoms may occur for RAPSN and DOK7 mutations
and in the slow-channel syndrome.

“Kinetic” gain- and loss-of-function nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor mutations
Rarely, postsynaptic CMS are caused by mutations
at different sites and different functional domains that
alter the kinetic channel properties. These kinetic mutations
result in the slow- or fast-channel syndromes. The
low-affinity, fast channel syndrome is caused by lossof-
function AChR subunit mutations that have similar
effects as AChR deficiency. Mutations at different sites
lead to fewer and shorter channel activations. In contrast
to all above CMS, the slow-channel syndrome presents
in childhood, adolescence or adult life with upper limb
predominance and contractures, does not respond to
acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors, and is progressive. CMS
patients with a slow-channel syndrome show increased
synaptic response to Ach, i.e. characteristic repetitive discharges
in response to a single supramaximal stimulus.
The syndrome results from gain-of-function mutations in
the ion-conducting pore M2. The leaky AChR exert an
excitotoxic effect and cause endplate myopathy via focal
caspase activation.

Myotonia – plasmalemmal
hyperexcitability due to mutant
Na+ or Cl- channels
Muscle stiffness, termed myotonia, ameliorates by
exercise, the “warm-up phenomenon”, and can be associated
with transient weakness during strenuous muscle activity
On the contrary, paradoxical myotonia (also called
paramyotonia) worsens with cold and after exercise. Both
myotonia and paramyotonia derive from uncontrolled repetitive
action potentials of the sarcolemma following an
initial voluntary activation. This may be noted as a myotonic
burst in the electromyogram. The involuntary electrical
activity prevents the muscle from immediate relaxation
after contraction, which the patients subsequently
experience as muscle stiffness.

As in myasthenia gravis and the CMS, a CMAP decrement
can occur at repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 Hz.
In contrast to the CMS, it starts later and might be more
pronounced (6, 7). It is caused by the increasing hypoexcitability
of the muscle fiber membrane due to sustained
membrane depolarization which is not improved by edrophonium.
This decrement leads to a dramatic loss of isometric
muscle strength during the first strong contractions
after rest. With repeated contractions, CMAP amplitude and strength return. This transient weakness occurs in the
Becker myotonia (Fig. 1) in which the stiffness is usually
more pronounced than in the Thomsen type.

Figure 1. Transient weakness in a patient with recessive
myotonia congenita.

et al., 2004 (1), mod.].

Chloride channel myotonias: Thomsen and Becker
Dominant Thomsen and recessive Becker myotonia
are caused by missense and nonsense mutations in the homodimeric
Cl- channel encoded by CLCN1. Functionally,
the dominant mutants exert a dominant negative effect on
the dimeric channel complex as shown by co-expression
studies, meaning that mutant/mutant and mutant/wildtype
complexes are malfunctional. The most common feature of
the resulting Cl- currents is a shift of the activation threshold
towards more positive membrane potentials almost out
of the physiological range. As a consequence of this, the
Cl- conductance is drastically reduced in the vicinity of the
resting membrane potential. The recessive mutants that do
not functionally hinder the associated subunit supply the
explanation of why two mutant alleles are required to reduce
Cl- conductance sufficiently for myotonia to develop
in Becker myotonia.

Sodium channel myotonia and paramyotonia congenita
(PMC)
In Na+ channel myotonia and paramyotonia, there is a
gating defect of the Na+ channels destabilizing the inactivated
state such that channel inactivation may be slowed
or incomplete (8-10). This results in an increased tendency
of the muscle fibers to depolarize which generates repetitive
action potentials (myotonia). The mutant channels
produce a dominant gain of function on the channel as
well as on cell excitability (Fig. 2).

Figure 2. Currents through the central pore of normal and mutant Nav1.4 channels.

Macroscopic (A, C) and single-channel (B, D) sodium currents
of normal and mutant Nav1.4 channels are shown. The currents
were elicited by a depolarization step from a holding potential of
-120 mV to +30 mV. Re-openings were more frequent for mutant
channels, thereby leading to a small persistent current as verified
by the tail current at the end of the pulse (C) [from Lehmann-
Horn et al., 2004 (1), mod.].

One hot spot for the PMC mutations is a special voltage-
sensing transmembrane region that couples channel
inactivation to channel activation; another hot spot is an
intracellular protein loop containing the inactivation particle
(Fig. 3). The potassium-aggravated myotonia (PAM)
mutations are found in intracellular regions of the protein, potentially interfering with the channel inactivation process.
Corresponding to the severity of the disruption of the
inactivation gate structure on the protein level, there are
three clinical severities to be distinguished: 1) myotonia
fluctuans where patients may not be aware of their disorder;
2) myotonia responsive to acetazolamide with a
Thomsen-like clinical phenotype, and 3) myotonia permanens
with continuous electrical myotonia leading to a
generalized muscle hypertrophy including facial and neck
muscles suggestive of facial dysmorphia (11-13). In all
three types, body exertion or administration of depolarizing
agents may result in a severe or even life-threatening
myotonic crisis (1).

Figure 3. The voltage-gated sodium channel of skeletal muscle, Nav1.4.

The alpha-subunit is composed of 4 highly homologous repeats (I-IV) each consisting of 6 transmembrane segments (S1-S6). When
inserted in membrane, the 4 repeats of the protein fold to generate a central pore, whereby the S5-S6 loops form the ion-selective
pore. The S4 segments contain positively charged residues conferring voltage dependence to the protein. Repeats are connected
by intracellular loops; one of them, the III-IV linker, contains the inactivation particle of the channel. The sketch gives an overview of
locations of known Nav1.4-mutations [from Jurkat-Rott, et al. 2010 (32) mod.].

As PMC channels fail to inactivate completely in
cold environment, the sodium inward current causes an
intracellular sodium and water accumulation that can be visualized in vivo by 23Na- und 1H-MRI (14).

Periodic paralysis - plasmalemmal
hypoexcitability due to mutant Na+
or Ca2+ channels
Symptoms occur episodically with varying intervals
of normal muscle function and excitation because ion
channel defects are usually well-compensated and an additional
trigger is often required for muscle inexcitability
due to sustained membrane depolarization. This depolarization
is responsible for the late CMAP decrement at
repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 Hz (long-exercise test). It
is not improved by edrophonium.

Three dominant episodic types of weakness with or
without myotonia are distinguished by the serum K+ level
during the attacks of tetraplegia: hyper-, normo- and hypokalemic
periodic paralysis (PP). Intake of K+ and glucose
has opposite effects in the two disorders: while K+
triggers a hyperkalemic attack and glucose is a remedy,
glucose provokes hypokalemic attacks which are ameliorated
by K+ intake. Due to additional release of K+ from
hyperkalemic PP muscle and uptake of K+ into hypokalemic
PP muscle, dyskalemia can be that severe during a
paralytic attack that cardiac complications arise. During
an attack, death can also occur due to respiratory insufficiency.

Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis - Na+ channel paralysis
combined with myotonia
Most Nav1.4 mutations that cause hyperkalemic PP
(HyperPP) are situated at inner parts of the transmembrane
segments or in intracellular protein loops (Fig. 3)
and affect structures that form the docking site for the
fast inactivation particle. Thereby, they impair fast channel
inactivation and lead to a persistent Na+ current. At the
beginning of an attack, the sustained inward current is associated
with a mild membrane depolarization and leads
to myotonia. The progressing attack is characterized by
membrane inexcitability and muscle weakness since the
penetrated Na+ ions go along with a more severe sustained
membrane depolarization that inactivates most Na+ channels.
Dependent on the location of the underlying mutation,
symptoms typical of HyperPP, K+-aggravated myotonia,
and paramyotonia congenita can overlap in a given
patient (15). As in PMC, HyperPP channels fail to inactivate
completely, and the sodium inward current causes an
intracellular sodium and water accumulation that can be
visualized in vivo by 23Na- und 1H-MRI (14).

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis – caused by Na+
and Ca2+ channel outer S4 mutations
Hypokalemic PP (HypoPP) differs from the hyperkalemic
form in the sense that a spontaneous attack is associated with hypokalemia, potassium is a remedy, whereas
carbohydrate- and sodium-rich food triggers an attack. In
general, the attacks last longer and are more severe. Usually,
the patients are weakest during the second half of
the night and in the morning, and become stronger as the
day goes by.

HypoPP is caused by mutations in two voltage-gated
cation channels in skeletal muscle Cav1.1 (HypoPP-1)
and Nav1.4 (HypoPP-2) (Fig. 3) (16). Almost all mutations
neutralize a positively charged amino acid in one
of the outermost arginines or lysines of a voltage sensor.
The Nav1.4 mutations are situated in the voltage sensors
of repeats I, II and III. The electrophysiological characterization
of the gating defects induced by these mutations
revealed a loss of channel function, which does not
explain the phenotype. By expressing HypoPP mutations
in Xenopus oocytes, a cation leak was discovered that
showed the typical characteristics found for the ω-current
in Shaker K+-channels (17-19). The ω-current, so called
to differentiate it from the (ω-)current through the ionconducting
pore, is a hyperpolarization-activated current
of monovalent cations that is though to flow through the
S4 gating pore (Fig. 4). The ω-current counteracts the rectifying
K+ currents and therefore depolarizes and destabilizes
the resting membrane potential so that the fraction of
depolarized, inexcitable fibers is increased (20). In vivo,
the muscles from these patients exhibited an intracellular
sodium accumulation and edema (21).

Figure 4. Leak currents through mutant voltage sensors.

(A) A replacement of the outermost arginine (left) by a smaller
amino acid e.g. glycine (center), opens a conductive pathway
at hyperpolarized potentials, resulting in an inward cation current
(arrow). At depolarized potentials at which the S4 segment
moves outward (right), the conductive pathway is closed and the
cation current ceases. (B) Schematic of cation currents through
sodium channels carrying charge-neutralizing substitutions in
S4 voltage sensors. Note the large inward current in the hyperpolarized
potential range corresponding to the resting state of
the leaky S4 voltage sensor [from Jurkat-Rott, et al. 2010 (32)
mod.].

As muscle fibers with a severe voltage sensor mutation
are depolarized not only during hypokalemia but also
at potassium levels in the normal range, this membrane
leak might not only explain episodes of weakness, but
interictal (permanent) weakness as well. The permanent
weakness associated with a fatty replacement myopathy
is very frequently found in patients harboring DIV mutations
in the calcium channel, i.e. Cav1.1 R1239H (21).

Normokalemic periodic paralysis – caused by Na+
channel inner S4 mutations
The term normokalemic PP was originally given to
a variant described in the 1960s. The disorder resembled
hyperkalemic PP in many aspects; the only real differences
were the lack of increase in the concentration of serum
potassium even during serious attacks, and the lack of a
beneficial effect of glucose administration (1). Recently,
a potassium-sensitive type of periodic paralysis with
normokalemia and episodes of weakness reminiscent of
those in both hyperkalemic (initiation of an attack by potassium)
and hypokalamic forms (duration of attacks) was
reported (22). This phenotype, is caused by SCN4A mutations
at deeper locations of the voltage sensor of domain
II at codon 675. Functionally, R675 mutations generate an
ω-current with a reversed voltage dependence compared to mutations causing HypoPP-2, since this site is exposed
to the extracellular space at stronger depolarizations (23).
The diagnostics for NormoPP are as described for the two
more common forms of the disease. The therapy consists
of avoidance of both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia and
the administration of acetazolamide.

K+ channel periodic paralysis with cardiac arrhythmia
Patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome may experience
a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia independent
of their PP is the primary cardiac manifestation. The
syndrome is characterized by the highly variable clinical
triad of dyskalemic PP, ventricular ectopy, and potential
dysmorphic features (24). The paralytic attack may be hyperkalemic
or hypokalemic and accordingly, the response
to oral K+ is unpredictable. Mutations of the Kir2.1 K+
channel, an inward rectifier expressed in skeletal and cardiac
muscle, are causative of the disorder. Kir2.1 channels are essential for maintaining the highly negative resting
membrane potential of muscle fibers and accelerating the
repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. The
mutations mediate loss of channel function by haploinsufficiency
or by dominant-negative effects on the wildtype
allele and may lead to long-lasting depolarization, fiber
membrane inexcitability and paralysis.

Muscle channelopathies due
to an altered excitationcontraction
coupling
Muscle contractures, i.e. electrically silent contractions
due to intracellular Ca2+ exceeding the mechanical
threshold, as well as flaccid weakness are characteristic
features of disturbed muscle excitation-contraction
coupling. Two allelic forms are well studied: malignant
hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD).

Malignant hyperthermia
Susceptibility to MH is an autosomal dominant predisposition
to respond abnormally when exposed to volatile
anesthetics, depolarizing muscle relaxants or extreme
physical activity in hot environments. During exposure
to triggering agents, a pathologically high increase in
myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration leads to increased muscle
metabolism and heat production resulting in muscle
contractures, hyperthermia associated with metabolic
acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoxia. The metabolic alterations
usually progress rapidly and without immediate
treatment, up to 70% of the patients die. Early administration
of dantrolene, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from
the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has successfully aborted
numerous fulminant crises and has reduced the mortality
rate to less than 10%.

In most families, mutations can be found in the gene
encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, RyR1.
This Ca2+ channel is not voltage-dependent on its own, but
exists under the control of Cav1.1. MHS mutations are usually
situated in the cytosolic part of the protein and show
gain-of-function effects: they increase RYR1 sensitivity to
caffeine and other activators as shown in functional tests
of both excised muscle, isolated native proteins, and ryanodine
receptors expressed in muscle and non-muscle
cells. For another MH locus on chromosome 1q31-32,
an R1086H disease-causing mutation was identified in
the skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel alpha1 subunit.
The mutation is located in an intracellular loop of the
protein whose functional significance for EC coupling is
under debate. Although mutations in the same gene cause
hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 1 this disorder is not
thought to be associated to MH susceptibility.

Central core disease (CCD) and multiminicore disease
(MmD)
CCD is a mainly dominant congenital myopathy. Although
it is genetically heterogeneous, most patients harbour
a RYR1 mutation (25). It is clinically characterized
by muscle hypotrophy and weakness and a floppy infant
syndrome, often alongside other skeletal abnormalities
such as hip displacement and scoliosis. Pathognomonic is
the abundance of central cores devoid of oxidative enzyme
activity along the predominant type 1 muscle fibers. Most
RyR1 mutations are situated in the SR-luminal region.
Some decrease the open probability of the RyR1 channel
so that it loses the ability to release Ca2+ in response to the
conformational DHPR alteration that is induced by depolarization
of the plasma membrane.26 However, RyR1
retains the ability to influence the open probability of the
DHPR. Other mutations increase the open probability of
the RyR1 channel, leading to depleted SR Ca2+ stores and
weakness.

MmD is recessively inherited and genetically heterogeneous
(27). The moderate form with generalized muscle
weakness predominantly of the pelvic girdle, hand
involvement, amyotrophy, and hyperlaxity is often associated
with RYR1 mutations. In contrast to CCD, the cores
are usually multiple, poorly defined and do not extend
along the whole fiber.

Medication of muscle
channelopathies
In many CMS, acetylcholineesterase inhibitors
(AChE-I) and 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) are effective
on the short- and long-term. In the AChE-deficiency and
the slow-channel syndrome, inhibitors have to be avoided.
In the latter, fluoxetine is very effective. In CMS caused
by DOK7 mutations, edrophonium might be successful,
whereas AChE-I are not effective on the long-term. However
these patients respond to ephedrine and albuterol.

The aim of drug therapy in myotonia and paramyotonia
is to reduce the unvoluntary action potential bursts
without blocking voluntary high-frequency muscle stimulation.
Local anesthetics and anti-arrhythmic drugs of
class IB or IC effectively relieve stiffness in chloride and
sodium channel myotonia and prevent weakness occurring
in PMC with cooling. Agents such as mexiletine (unfortunately
taken from the market because of profit shrinkage)
and other lidocaine analogs and the IC antiarrhythmic
drugs flecainide and propafenone, prevent repetitive firing
of action potentials due to their “use dependence”, a dependence
of the depth of block on the frequency of action
potentials. The degree of use dependence varies with
the structure (charge and hydrophobicity) of the drug. Beyond this “unspecific” antimyotonic effect, the agents
seem to be more effective on certain mutant sodium channels
than on normal channels. Particularly mutant sodium
channels that exhibit an enhanced closed-state inactivation
are sensitive which suggests potential for mutationspecific
treatment (28, 29). Recently relief from episodic
weakness with pyridostigmine was reported for a PMC
family (30). However it should be kept in mind that pyridostigmine
can exacerbate myotonia.

Unfortunately the spontaneous and potassium-induced
attacks of weakness typical for HyperPP and
also occurring in some PMC patients are not improved
by lidocaine analogs or antiarrhythmic drugs. However
diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide
and acetazolamide
can decrease frequency and severity of paralytic episodes,
probably by lowering serum potassium and perhaps by
shifting the pH to lower values.

In HypoPP, acute weakness spells can be treated by
potassium and be prevented by certain carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and potassium-sparing
diuretics. Serum potassium levels in the high normal
range help reduce the paradoxical membrane depolarization
and therefore shift the resting potential to more
normal values. Acetazolamide also lowers intracellular
sodium accumulation in these patients addressing both
pathogenetic factors in HypoPP: depolarization and sodium
accumulation (21). The repolarizing effect of acetazolamide
may be explained at least partially by opening
of big conductance potassium channels (31).

During a malignant hyperthermia crisis, sufficient
amounts of the antidote dantrolene have to be administered
intravenously in addition to symptomatic treatment
such as the immediate stop of the triggering agents. In
CCD, muscle strength can be improved by exercise (unpublished
observation).
