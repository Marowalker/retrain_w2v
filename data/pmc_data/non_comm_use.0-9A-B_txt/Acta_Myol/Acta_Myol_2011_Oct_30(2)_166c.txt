==== Body
Multiple Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II, is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of fatty acid metabolism which affects all the fatty-acid acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme system. The disorder is usually due to defects in the genes of either alpha- or beta-subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFA; MIM# 231680, ETFB; MIM# 130410) or ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH; MIM#231675). 

Molecular defects in the ETFDH gene were found to be responsible for a specific sub-group of patients affected with a variant of the disease responsive to riboflavin (vitamin B2), a precursor of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) required in biological oxidation-reduction reactions. These patients are usually young adult presenting with proximal muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, elevated serum CK, cyclical vomiting and episodes of acute encephalopathy, generally precipitated by an infection.

Herein, we report on a patient suffering from a riboflavinresponsive MADD with no evidence of molecular defects in the ETFA, ETFB and ETFDH genes.

The patient was treated with riboflavin at the dosage of 100 mg/day associated with a low-fatty acid diet. After six months, clinical examination showed global improvement in motor functions.

Our report remarks that not all the cases of riboflavinresponsive MADD are due to ETFDH mutations, suggesting a genetic heterogeneity in this disease. As flavin binding is essential for the normal function of the Acyl CoA dehydrogenases, this riboflavin-responsive disease could be caused by some yet unidentified disorder of mitochondrial flavin metabolism and transport or flavoprotein homeostasis.

Anyway, in these cases, treatment with riboflavin can be alike effective. Therefore, early diagnosis is important to achieve the best treatment response.
