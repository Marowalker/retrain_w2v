==== Body
The present issue opens the thirtieth volume of Acta Myologica, and, just as people celebrate the appearance of a new century a year ahead of time, we will not wait until the end of the third decade of this journal's appearance, but will hail the first issue, that comes with an XXX printed on its cover, with a short account of the journal's history.

Almost 30 years ago, two experts in neuromuscular disorders from the Faculty of Medicine of the Neapolitan University Federico II, Prof Giovanni Nigro, then head of the Servizio di Cardiomiologia e Miologia, and his proxy since 1963, Prof Lucia Ines Comi, decided to launch a new journal that was especially devoted to their field of professional interest. In June 1982, the first issue appeared under the name of Cardiomyology, with Nigro acting as editor-in-chief, and his scientific alter ego Comi seconding him as managing co-ordinator. An editorial staff of nine Neapolitan specialists assisted the two founders, and they in turn were aided by an editorial board of 20 experts, with Italian cardiologists prevailing. These were complemented by a few international experts in myology, such as Victor Dubowitz (a paediatrician), Alan Emery (a geneticist), as well as Georges Serratrice and Sir John Walton (two neurologists), in order to broaden the scope of the journal.

The interest in myology and cardiomyology had indeed substantially increased during the 1960s all over the medical scientific world, and this development had also stimulated Nigro's own work group. They actively participated in the 1st International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases held in Milan in 1968, and eight years later they established a "University Center for Muscular Dystrophies" financially supported by the Neapolitan branch of the Italian Muscular Dystrophy Association (UILDM). The latter had of course also been initiated by Giovanni Nigro. The next big step forward was in May 1982, the organisation of a successful "International Meeting on X-linked Muscular Dystrophy" at Naples' famous Castel dell'Ovo. This meeting "stressed interesting correlations between cardiological findings and aspects of skeletal muscle physiopathology" as Nigro pointed out in his first editorial of Cardiomyology, and the successful specification of this correlation has certainly been a constant factor in the scientific programme of Nigro's team and its public platform.

Research into myology and cardiomyology flourished, as did the journal, so that in 1990 Nigro and Comi felt that the separation of patient treatment from scientific matters would best be accomplished by the establishment of an academy, for which the editing of the journal would then be a key function, another being to oversee the awards of a biennial prize given for merit in three areas: in clinical sciences, basic sciences and in the social field. The academy as well as the prizes were named after Gaetano Conte, a 19th century Neapolitan physician who in 1836 had indeed been the first to describe two cases of what was later named Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Not only did Conte's description precede by 32 years that of the famous name-giving neurologist from Boulogne, he had also clearly – and suitably for Nigro's predilections – detected the involvement of the heart in the disease process. All this had, however, long been forgotten and was only re-discovered in 1990 by Dr Vita Petretta, one of Nigro's co-workers, following a kind hint by Victor Dubowitz.

When the journal was brought under the wing of the Gaetano Conte Academy in June 1990 it was given the new name of Acta Cardiomyologica, with Giovanni Nigro continuing as editor-in-chief and Lucia Comi as managing co-ordinator. The editorial staff was "rejuvenated" by replacing two of the original members with V. Petretta and L. Politano, junior members of the Neapolitan Department of Cardiomyology. The editorial board was at the same time enlarged to more than forty international members, from many fields such as neurology, biochemistry, genetics, orthopaedics, physiology and, of course, cardiology.

Meanwhile the activities of the Gaetano Conte Academy, and particularly its journal, took on a certain leadership in the distribution of information on neuromuscular disorders in the whole Mediterranean area. When this development became a more or less irreversible obligation in 1993, Giovanni Nigro decided to found a society of its own for this task. He called it Mediterranean Society of Myology (MSM), and it was decided that the journal of the Gaetano Conte Academy would become the official organ of the new association. At the same time the journal's name was changed once more to Acta Myologica to account for the fact that – with the wider scope of the MSM – the interest of the journal had also broadened. The offices of editor-in-chief and managing co-ordinator remained in the well-proven hands of G. Nigro and L. Comi, but, in order to cope with the increased work, the new positions of three co-editors (L. Middleton, R. Rüdel and G. Serratrice) were added to the editorial staff. For the following years to the present, the name of the journal and the position of the editor-in-chief have remained unchanged, although on the lower echelons several changes have occurred: In December 2000, V. Petretta and L. Politano were included in the list of editorial board members, and at the same time F. Tomé joined the team of co-editors. Then three years later, in 2003, V. Askanas also became a co-editor.

The scientific recognition achieved by Acta Myologica in the last decade is reflected in graphs of citations per document (Fig. 1) and of international collaboration (Fig. 2). The journal is now covered by Index Medicus, Medicine, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and is monitored for coverage in Chemical Abstracts Service and appears online on PubMed Home.

From the first issue of 2005 on, the journal was given three subtitles "Myopathies, Cardiomyopathies and Neuropathies" and the team of co-editors was changed to V. Askanas, L. Middleton, G. Novelli, R. Rüdel and F. Tomé. At the same time a new section, "Historical Studies", was added to the contents, with G. Serratrice as the editor responsible. In 2008 Prof G. Karpati served for a short time as co-editor until his untimely death. As a service to all readers, from December 2008 on, all articles published in the Journal can be downloaded free of charge from PubMed.

Perhaps the most dramatic change in the journal's editing crew had to occur after the passing away of Lucia Ines Comi on 29 April 2009. As one of the two founders of the journal she had indeed, up to her death, devoted a great deal of her time and energy to her favourite job. From the first issue of 2009 her chair has been occupied by Prof Luisa Politano who is now acting as editorial manager. At the same time Giovanni Nigro is supported by his son, Prof Vincenzo Nigro, as assistant editor.

A great challenge for the Neapolitan team was to organise the 12th International Conference on Neuromuscular Disorders in 2010 without Lucia Comi. The abstracts of this outstanding event filled the most voluminous issue that Acta Myologica ever dispatched. With the new team having passed this major test, we can feel safe in the knowledge that in the next decade Acta Myologica will continue to keep us abreast of new developments in myology and cardiomyology. Of course one of our greatest hopes is that it will soon bring us the long-anticipated announcement of successful gene therapy in hereditary neuromuscular disorders.
