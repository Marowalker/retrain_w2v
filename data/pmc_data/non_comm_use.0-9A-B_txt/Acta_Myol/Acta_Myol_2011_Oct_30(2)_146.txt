Dear Friends and Colleagues,

as you probably know, in collaboration with Professor Giovanni Nigro and the MSM Advisory Board, we are organising here in Pisa, 28th-30th of April 2011, the X International Congress of the Mediterranean Society of Myology (MSM2011). Following the previous editions of MSM meetings, the aim of this event is to address some of the more actual aspects in the management of muscle diseases. Genetic and molecular approaches to muscle diseases continue to generate novel acquisitions capable to drive clinical strategies for diagnosis and therapies of these diseases. In this sense developing treatments, targeted to improve function, quality of life and care of people with muscle disease, require a co-ordinated multidisciplinary approach from medical community in the prospect of novel clinical trial designs. Proposed platform sessions include update on pharmacological treatments, channelopathies and myotonic syndromes, rehabilitation and respiratory treatments in myopathies, this latter within a joint session with the pneumologists.

Pisa is a beautiful city located on the Tyrrhenian cost of the Tuscany rich of art, history, culture and natural riches. Its historical past as a marine republic within the Mediterranean sea makes Pisa as an ideal location for the ongoing MSM Congress, gathering a flavour in a warm hosting of people coming from all over around the sides of this unbelievable sea, the "mare nostrum". With the deep hope you can participate to this event, it will be our pleasure to welcome you in the city to friendly enjoy your stay and take home a good memory of it.

Looking forward to see you in Pisa,

Gabriele Siciliano

President of the Local Organizing Committee
