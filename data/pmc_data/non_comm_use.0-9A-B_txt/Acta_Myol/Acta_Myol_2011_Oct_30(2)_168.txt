==== Body
A large Spanish kindred with apparently autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported with proximal limb and axial muscle weakness. Clinical, histological and genetic features have been described in 5/32 patients. A novel LGMD disease locus at chromosome 7q32.1-32.2 has been identified, but any defects were detected in filamin C, a gene candidate from this chromosomal region encoding actin binding protein highly expressed in muscle. We report a clinico-pathological study of two patients (mother and daughter) from the same Spanish family. Age at onset was in the teens: earlier onset in the daughter with a faster weakness progress confirms an apparent genetic anticipation. Morphologic findings were similar in both cases: H&E notices increased fiber size variability, fiber atrophy, endo- and perimisial connective tissue, and acid-phosphatase positive vacuoles. The ultrastructural study confirmed fiber atrophy, abnormal mitochondria accumulations and autophagosomal vacuoles containing cell debris and pseudomyelin figures: no filamentous inclusions were detected which are usually associated with a HIBM. Many alterations of myofibrillar component were easily detected such as prominent disarray, rod-like structures with granular aspect, and occasionally cytoplasmic bodies. Our morphological data support the hypothesis that other actin-encoding proteins such as FSCN3, and KIAA0265 from the same critical region may represent attractive candidate genes in the LGMD 1(F) pathogenetic mechanism.
