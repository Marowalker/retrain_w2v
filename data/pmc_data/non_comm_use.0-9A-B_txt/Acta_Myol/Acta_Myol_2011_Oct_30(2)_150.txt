First of all I would like to thank Prof. Giovanni Nigro and the organizing committee for awarding me the 2011 Gaetano Conte Prize, on the field of Social Aspects. I must confess that it was a completely unexpected surprise and the most wonderful thing about is the possibility to receive it in Italy, in a country that I love, and surrounded with very dear friends. 

Although I question if I deserve this prize, it is true that I have always been worried with the social aspects related to neuromuscular disorders, in particular, living in a country where poor people have no access to a decent treatment. When I was still a master degree student I was not happy to be only in the laboratory and since the beginning of my research life I was very much involved in genetic counseling of families with neuromuscular disorders.

I went to UCLA in Los Angeles for my post doc and when I came back I decided to visit the families who I had counseled. I wanted to know if genetic counseling (GC) had any impact on their lives, if high risk carriers had deterred procreation. I managed to visit more than 300 families and had two surprises: the good one was to see that most mothers of Duchenne patients had understood the GC and very few children were born among those with a high genetic risk. The sad surprise was to see how abandoned were the older affected children from poor families: no wheelchair, no transportation, no conditions to attend schools, physiotherapy clinics or any treatment. They were completely isolated from social life. I decided then that being just a scientist was not enough. I had to do more for these children and I founded the Brazilian muscular dystrophy association – ABDIM – in an attempt to improve their quality of life. We rented a house, remodeled it and established a center next to the University. Now ABDIM serves more than 100 patients who come twice a week and provides them with physiotherapy, physical therapy, but also training in arts and computers: anything to improve life quality and expectancy. Anything to make them happier. In addition we have almost 1000 patients that come from all over Brazil every 3 to 6 months for followup. And indeed life expectancy increased significantly which is particularly important at this moment because we hope that extending their lives will allow them to benefit of new discovered treatments. I am still the President of ABDIM- not because I want it- but because so far nobody wanted to take over. More recently, I was also involved in the political decisions regarding the approval of the bill that allows research with embryonic stem cells in Brazil. On one hand, as a scientist I wanted to have in Brazil the same freedom for research as most developed countries. On the other hand I believed that approving this law would be extremely important when talking to patients and parents. As you know, when we tell parents that their child has a progressive severe disease for which the cure has not been found yet they would be willing to go any place in the world to try to find a treatment. We wanted to tell them that if the stem cells bill would be approved in Brazil we would be able to do the same research that is being done in first world countries. They would not need to go abroad. And I started to fight for it. Indeed, after many debates, the bill was definitively approved by our Supreme Court in 2008.

Finally, I had the great privilege to listen some years ago to the talk of Rita Levi Montalcini, this incredible Italian woman and Nobel prize scientist. It was during a Congress in United States. She started her talk saying that she had taken a taxi in Italy to reach the airport and the driver looked at her and said: I know you. You are a famous person. Then she asked: Why? Because of my Nobel Prize? No he replied, for your social work.

I don't have the pretension to compare myself with Rita Levi. She is the woman I most admire on earth. But when I received the email from Giovanni Nigro I was reminded of her and I felt incredibly rewarded for doing social work. Initially from patients, from their families, and now from you my dear Italian friends for awarding me this prize.

Thank you very much!
