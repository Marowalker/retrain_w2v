Mesoangioblasts are a class of adult stem cells of mesoderm origin, potentially useful for the treatment of primitive myopathies of different etiology. Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies in animal models of muscular dystrophy have demonstrated the ability of mesoangioblast to repair skeletal muscle when injected intra-arterially. In a previous work we demonstrated that mesoangioblasts obtained from diagnostic muscle biopsies of IBM patients display a defective differentiation down skeletal muscle and this block can be corrected in vitro by transient MyoD transfection. We are currently investigating different pathways involved in mesoangioblasts skeletal muscle differentiation and exploring alternative stimulatory approaches not requiring extensive cell manipulation. This will allow to obtain safe, easy and efficient molecular or pharmacological modulation of pro-myogenic pathways in IBM mesoangioblasts. It is of crucial importance to identify factors (ie. cytokines, growth factors) produced by muscle or inflammatory cells and released in the surrounding milieu that are able to regulate the differentiation ability of IBM mesoangioblasts. To promote myogenic differentiation of endogenous mesoangioblasts in IBM muscle, the modulation of such target molecules selectively dysregulated would be a more handy approach to enhance muscle regeneration compared to transplantation techniques.

Studies on the biological characteristics of IBM mesoangioblasts with their aberrant differentiation behavior, the signaling pathways possibly involved in their differentiation block and the possible strategies to overcome it in vivo, might provide new insights to better understand the etiopathogenesis of this crippling disorder and to identify molecular targets susceptible of therapeutic modulation.

==== Body
For long time, satellite cellshave been considered the only myogenic source for post-natal growth, repair and maintenance of skeletal muscle. More recently several blood-born and muscle-resident stem cells have been identified in interstitial spaces of skeletal muscle with the capability to differentiate into myogenic cells, thus contributing to de novo formation of muscle fibers (1-4). Mesoangioblasts are a new class of adult stem cells of mesoderm origin, potentially useful for the treatment of primitive myopathies of different etiology (5). These cells, firstly isolated from dorsal aorta of murine embryos, have been largely studied in murine models, demonstrating their ability to extensively grow in vitro, maintaining their differentiation potential down the different mesodermal tissues (smooth and skeletal muscle, fat and bone) (6,7). In addition, mesoangioblasts are capable to form muscle fibers after direct intramuscular injection and, more importantly, intra-arterial delivery into immune deficient dystrophic α sarcoglycan (αSG) null mice. In particular, by flowing through blood circulation they migrate into downstream skeletal muscles, mainly reaching areas of muscle degeneration/regeneration, repairing skeletal muscle with concomitant recovery of global muscle function (8). The therapeutic value of mesoangioblasts in large animal models was recently demonstrated in a canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (9). Wild type (wt) or autologous mesoangioblasts transduced in vitro with a lentiviral vector expressing human microdystrophin transplanted intra-arterially into dystrophic dogs led to extensive reconstitution of fibers expressing dystrophin, with improvement in the contraction force and, in many cases, preservation of walking ability. This study showed that mesoangioblasts transplantation is a safe and effective procedure in large animals opening the way for possible future clinical trials in muscular disorders.

Human mesoangioblasts
In the last years, we and others isolated the human counterpart of murine mesoangioblasts from fragments of diagnostic muscle biopsies of patients affected by inflammatory myopathies (IM) (10), DMD (11) andfacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (12). These cells display a high proliferative rate and can be kept in culture, maintaining a normal diploid karyotype, up to 25 population doublings (PD) when large senescent cells start to appear.

Human mesoangioblasts are able to differentiate into smooth and skeletal muscle, osteoblasts or adipocytes. When co-cultured with murine myogenic cells, exposed to muscle-differentiation medium (11) or cultured in normal human myoblasts-conditioned medium, to facilitate their commitment (10), a large proportion of cells differentiate into multinucleated myotubes.

Human cells express pericytes markers (annexin V;alkaline phosphatase, ALP; desmin; α-smooth actin, α-SMA; vimentin;platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, PDGFR β), while, at variance with their murine counterpart, do not express typical endothelial markers (CD31, CD34 and VEGF receptor 2/KDR) and M-cadherin, NCAM, cytokeratins or neurofilaments. They do not constitutively express myogenic markers (MyoD, Myf5, Myogenin, Pax7). The expression of surface antigens is as follows: strongly positive for CD13 and CD44, weakly positive for CD49b, uniformly negative, among others, for CD31, CD34, CD45, CD133 (10, 11). Together, these markers identify human adult mesoangioblasts as the in vitro progeny of pericytes.

Mesoangioblasts from inflammatory myopathies
In our first study, we isolated with high efficiency
and characterized mesoangioblasts from diagnostic muscle
biopsies of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies
(dermatomyositis, DM, polymyositis, PM and
inclusion-body myositis, IBM). Mesoangioblasts from
DM, PM and IBM retain the same proliferation ability
and cell cycle distribution of cells isolated from normal
muscle, and can be grown in vitro and expanded for as
many as 25-30 passages (21,3 ± 3,21 PD), though not indefinitely.
The exposure of DM and PM mesoangioblasts
to normal myoblast-conditioned medium is greatly effective
in inducing skeletal muscle differentiation, outlining
the importance of muscle-secreted factors for myogenic
maturation of these stem cells. By contrast, IBM mesoangioblasts
display a marked and selective impairment of
skeletal muscle differentiation, with the formation of only
spare mononucleated myosin-positive myotubes under
the same culture conditions promoting massive skeletal
muscle differentiation of mesoangioblasts from DM, PM,
and normal muscle. Of note, normal mesoangioblasts exposed
to IBM-myoblast-conditioned medium efficiently
differentiate down skeletal muscle.

Interestingly, cultures of myogenic (satellite-derived)
MyoD-positive cells obtained from the same biopsy samples
undergo, under appropriate conditions, terminal differentiation,
indicating that the myogenic differentiation
process can reach terminal stage in cultured satellite cells
from IBM. This is in agreement with previous studies
showing that cultured IBM myogenic cells proliferate
and terminally differentiate and can be properly innervated
(13, 14).

Defective myogenic differentiation of IBM
mesoangioblasts
We showed for the first time, that a progenitor cell,
resident in a perivascular niche of IBM muscle is defective
in myogenic determination and differentiation. No
significant differences of age existed between the IBM
and DM/PM patients in our study, excluding a mere
consequence of muscle aging, but strongly suggesting
a causal correlation with the specific pathophysiology
of IBM. Interestingly, IBM muscle, that is characterized
by an inadequate long term regeneration despite a normal
number of satellite cells at least early in the disease,
shows scarcity in muscle connective tissue of ALP-positive
cells, likely activated pericytes (representing the cells
from which mesoangioblasts are established in vitro), and
a failure of the isolated mesoangioblasts to differentiate
in vitro. Genome wide analysis of IBM mesoangioblasts
showed that, differently from their normal or other myopathies
counterparts, they express high levels of transforming
growth factor β 1 (TGFβ1), a known inhibitor
of myogenesis (15), SFRP (Soluble Frizzled Related
Protein) 2, a Wnt antagonist shown to block myogenic
conversion of CD45+ SP cells (16), and BHLH (basic
helix loop helix) B3, a transcription factor that inhibits
MyoD activity (17), any of which might be responsible
for the differentiation block. Unraveling the molecular
basis of such block will likely provide both significant
insights into the mechanisms of IBM muscle diminished
regenerative potential involving satellite and other muscle
precursor cells, as well as more selective modulatory
strategies to correct the defective myogenic maturation
of IBM mesoangioblasts. However, we demonstrated that
MyoD transient transduction is sufficient to induce a normal
progression of IBM mesoangioblasts along the skeletal
muscle differentiation path.

Mesoangioblasts and inflammation in vivo
Analysis of molecular phenotype of human mesoangioblasts
from IM, although with specific differences in
gene expression profiles between IBM and DM, shows
a general up-regulation of several inflammation-related
genes (10). This probably reflects a “conditioning” effect
of the local muscle environment in immune-mediated
myopathies characterized by marked increase of adhesion
molecules, chemokines and pro-inflammatory Th1
cytokines. Mesoangioblasts expression of adhesion molecules
involved in the processes of leukocytes rolling, adhesion
to vascular endothelium and transmigration across
blood vessels well correlates with their ability, at variance
with satellite cells, to migrate and home into damaged
muscle by using their adhesion properties to reach interstitial
spaces of muscle when injected intra-arterially (8).
Molecules such as integrins and selectins are highly expressed
during muscle inflammation, as well as secreted
factors such as stromal derived factor 1(SDF-1) and tumor
necrosis factor α (TNFα that have also a remarkable
effect in improving homing to skeletal muscle of normal
mouse and human mesoangioblasts (18).

IBM defective regeneration
Post-natal mesoangioblasts considered as part of the
pericyte population are located in perithelial position and
express ALP in vivo (11). It is interesting to note that a
characteristic histochemical feature of PM and DM is
the strong ALP-positivity in perimysial and endomysial
connective tissue (normally connective tissue is ALPnegative
and only blood vessels’ wall and occasional regenerant
muscle fibers are stained), as opposed to IBM
as well as other myopathies with increased connective
tissue such as DMD, usually displaying no or very little
ALP-positivity (19). It has been noted that this feature
correlates more with the regenerative properties of muscle
rather than with inflammatory changes. In fact, ALP
staining, usually negative earlier in the course of PM,
persists in spite of immunosuppressive treatment that
can rapidly eliminate inflammatory cells from the biopsy
specimens, leading to the hypothesis that it could reflect
activated or proliferating fibroblasts (19). Although ALP
activity is generally considered a marker of osteoblasts
differentiation, we showed data strongly suggesting that
human ALP-positive mesoangioblasts likely represent
an activated cell population found in the muscle connective
tissue of IM, originating from the perivascular niche,
susceptible of myogenic determination in vivo, as indicated
by MyoD expression and contributing to muscle
repair and regeneration. To what extent mesoangioblasts
contribute to muscle regeneration, either directly or by
feeding the satellite cells pool, is unknown. However, it is conceivable that during extensive muscle regeneration,
i.e. following inflammatory muscle damage as in
DM-PM, activated mesoangioblasts may play a much
more significant role than in normal muscle repair. On
the contrary, in IBM muscle in spite of the presence of
some degree of chronic lymphomonocytic inflammation,
defective mesoangioblasts cannot keep up with progressive
muscle fibers degeneration participating to formation
of new muscle fibers.

Ongoing studies
Our previous studies have shown that adenoviral-mediated
overexpression of MyoD or silencing the inhibitor
BHLHB3 gene by siRNA are able to restore the progression
down the myogenic pathway of IBM mesoangioblasts.
However, though experimentally effective, these
procedures are unlike to be used in clinical practice as an
induction treatment for autologous mesoangioblasts expanded
in culture before a possible intra-arterial delivery
in IBM patients. Therefore we are currently investigating
different pathways involved in skeletal muscle differentiation
of these cells and exploring alternative stimulatory
approaches not requiring extensive cell manipulation, in
order to obtain safe, easy and efficient molecular or pharmacological
modulation of pro-myogenic pathways in
IBM mesoangioblasts (20, 21).

Among the possible ex vivo treatments, we have explored in vitro the effects of different treatments with molecules known to act on pro-myogenic pathways, such as deacetylase inhibitors (DI, trichostatin A, TSA and 5-azacytidine) as single agents orin combination with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and argininevasopressin (AVP) that may enhance the response of IBM mesoangioblasts to DI. Transient exposure to DI or AVP followed by our differentiation protocol led to a significant increase of myotubes formation, however, the efficiency of these pharmacological approaches is not yet as good as that experimentally observed with MyoD overexpression (unpublished results). This implies that in order to become of clinical significance these treatments must be associated to others ex vivo approaches.

More recently, we have investigated the expression of the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEFT) known to be transcriptionally up-regulated during myogenic differentiation, promoting, when overexpressed by gene transfer, skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo through the Rho-signaling cascade (22-25). In several independent experiment, we have observed that IBM mesoangioblasts express significantly lower levels of the protein compared to normal or PM and DM mesoangioblasts. By overexpressing GEFT in IBM mesoangioblasts, using a pCMV-Tag 2B expression vector containing the human GEFT cDNA sequence, upon exposure to differentiating medium cells were able to fuse into multinucleated myosin-positive myotubes, although with low efficiency. To determine whether IBM hGEFT-transduced mesoangioblasts kept their myogenic potential also in vivo, we transplanted them into the tibialis anterior of SCID mice and evaluated their ability to participate in muscle regeneration. From our in vivo experiments, we observed that after transplantation of GEFT-transfected IBM mesoangioblasts, many areas of injected muscle were reconstituted with fibers expressing human spectrin and containing human nuclei. Our data obtained so far, would suggest a possible functional role of GEFT in IBM muscle (manuscript in preparation).

Conclusions and future
perspectives
Despite the presence also in IBM of CD8-mediated
myocytotoxicity that is known to play a major role in PM,
the exact pathogenic significance of inflammatory changes
in this disorder is unclear, as patients respond poorly
or not at all to immunosuppressive therapies. In PM and
in DM, the latter being a complement-mediated microangiopathy
of skeletal muscle, current immunotherapies are
usually effective and suppression of lymphomonocytic
infiltration of muscle obtained by steroids and immune
suppressive drugs is followed by efficient muscle regeneration
and recovery of muscle strength and trophism. On
the contrary, IBM muscle is characterized by the presence
of unique degenerative features and inefficient regenerative
properties. Thus, IBM invariably progresses leading
to a significant disability. Our studies showing that also
from IBM it is possible to isolate cells with a high myogenic
potential, such as mesoangioblasts, localized in the
perivascular niche and normally not actively producing
skeletal muscle, might open new therapeutic strategies of
clinical relevance. However, since mesoangioblasts isolated
from IBM muscle fail to normally differentiate into
skeletal muscle, in order to envisage a possible clinical
use of autologous mesoangioblasts as muscle regenerative
cell therapy, it will be essential to stimulate in vitro
IBM mesoangioblasts to enhance their defective myogenic
differentiation. Even more important would be to
successfully activate in vivo the endogenous mesoangioblasts
present in IBM muscle inducing them to make new
regenerating fibers thus actively counteracting progressive
muscle degeneration. To this end, it is of paramount
importance the identification of factors (ie. cytokines,
growth factors) produced by muscle or inflammatory
cells and released in the surrounding milieu able to regulate
the differentiation ability of IBM mesoangioblasts.
Modulation of such target molecules selectively dysregulated
in IBM muscle to promote myogenic differentiation
of endogenous mesoangioblasts appears a more handy
approach to enhance muscle regeneration compared to
transplantation techniques.

Actually, the use of myogenic stem cells to cure any muscle disorder represents a very difficult challenge and it is now unpredictable whether it will ever come true. However, their safety as therapeutic tool has been demonstrated (9) and a phase I clinical trial with donor-derived mesoangioblasts is ongoing in DMD patients (26). Nevertheless, major technical problems exist that is necessary to overcome to achieve satisfactory transplantation and engraftment of homogeneous population of myogenic precursors. On one side, in fact, in genetic myopathies it must be demonstrated that muscle reconstitution with fibers expressing the defective gene will be clinically relevant to thwart progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. On the other side, in acquired diseases of muscle, transplanted stem cells might in turn become target of the same noxae causing the disease, thus frustrating the attempt to significantly contribute to muscle regeneration and counteract the progressive atrophy of treated muscles. Nevertheless, studies on the biological characteristics of IBM mesoangioblasts with their aberrant differentiation behavior, the signaling pathways possibly involved in their differentiation block and the possible strategies to overcome it in vivo, might provide new insights to better understand the etiopathogenesis of this crippling disorder and to identify molecular targets susceptible of therapeutic modulation.
