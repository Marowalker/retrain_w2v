==== Body
AMO (Acta Myologica Online) – the official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology and of the Associazione Italiana di Miologia (AIM ) – celebrates its first year with the new process of electronic submission, fast reviewing and a completely free web-based access.

During the last years the Journal has increased the number of its citations (see Figure 1) and according to the rating of the Scimago Journal & Country Rank it should have a H Index of 22.

So the Board of the Journal decided to increase the number of issues per year passing from the current three issues per year to four issues to be published in March, June, September and December respectively.

Guest Editors for special issues focusing on the most recent development on the field of neuromuscular disorders are welcome. We invite the members of both scientific Societies and the followers to support us in this initiative.
