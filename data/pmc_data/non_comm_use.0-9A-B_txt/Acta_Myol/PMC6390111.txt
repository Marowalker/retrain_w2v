clinical and genetic features of childhood-onset limb-girdle muscular
dystrophies (LGMD) in the Aegean part of Turkey. In total fifty-six
pediatric cases with LGMD followed in four different pediatric
neurology departments in the Aegean region of Turkey were evaluated.
Among them, LGMD2C was the most common followed by LGMD2A, LGMD2D, and
LGMD2F with equal frequencies. In twenty-eight patients (50%) the
diagnosis could be confirmed by genetic analysis, where
SGCG proved to be disease-causing in most of the
cases. About half of the patients were diagnosed with whole exome or
targeted gene sequencing. A positive correlation between muscle biopsy
and genetic findings were observed in 11% of the patients. We report
one novel frameshifting mutation in TTN. Knowledge on
frequencies of childhood-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophies and
related genes in Turkey will lead to a prompt diagnosis of these
neuromuscular disorders.

==== Body
Introduction
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) are clinically and
genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders. They are inherited in an
autosomal recessive or dominant manner. Thirty-three recessively and
dominantly inherited forms have currently been identified. The
prevalence is about 4-7 per 100.000. They may have childhood, teenage or
adulthood onsets. They are clinically characterized by symmetrical
weakness of pelvic, scapular and trunk muscles, raised serum creatine
kinase levels and dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy (1).

Autosomal recessive muscle disorders like LGMD and congenital
muscular dystrophies are common in Turkey due to high rates of
consanguineous marriages. Unfortunately, the distribution of subgroups
is not well known. The Aegean region is one of seven regions found in
Turkey. It is situated in the western part of the country. The region
includes 8 provinces and over nine million inhabitants. Having knowledge
of specific subgroups of a muscle disease, their related genes and
clinical findings in a specific geographic region should alert
physicians for prompt disease identification. The aim of this study is
to document the clinical findings and related mutations in proven cases
of childhood-onset LGMD in the Aegean part of Turkey.

Material and methods
Patients
Patients with childhood onset LGMD clinical features plus confirmed
histologic, genetic or histologic plus genetic diagnosis of LGMD of
four different child neurology departments (Dokuz Eylül University,
Ege University, Izmir Dr. Behçet Uz Children’s Hospital, Tepecik
Research, and Education Hospital) were included in the study. The
individual database was reviewed in all cases. Clinical information
including age, gender, family history and consanguinity was recorded.
Serum creatine kinase levels, nerve conduction times and
electromyographic examinations were also evaluated.

Muscle biopsy
Most of the patients underwent a diagnostic muscle biopsy after
written informed consent was obtained. Muscle biopsies were obtained
from gastrocnemius or vastus lateralis muscles. The morphological and
immunohistochemistry analyses were performed in accordance with
standard procedures (Supplement 1).

Genetic analysis
Genomic DNAs were extracted from the remnant muscle tissues or
blood samples using available DNA extraction kits (Qiagen, US)
following the manufacturer’s standard protocol. The exon regions and
flanking short intronic sequences of the 4 SGCs genes were amplified
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by direct
sequencing of the PCR products (ABI, US). In addition, the multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique was used for
deletion and duplication analysis for patient 13(2). Patients with nonspecific muscle biopsy findings
underwent either whole exome sequencing (WES) (Table 1: patient 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 21, and 26)
or for patient 6, 9, 20, 22-25, 27 and 28 Mendeliome sequencing, which
solved 54% of the genetically confirmed cases. For WES, we used the
Nimblegen enrichment (SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.00) kit and
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 with an average mean coverage of
103 fold or we used Agilent SureSelect V6 enrichment kit with an
average mean coverage of 82 fold. For the other 10% of the patients,
we used targeted gene sequencing on the Illumina TruSight One panel
(Mendeliome, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an average mean
coverage of 97 fold. The Cologne Center for Genomics VARBANK pipeline
v.2.12 (https://varbank.ccg.uni-koeln.de/) was used for genomic data
analysis (3-5). All
patients were also investigated for dystrophin deletion/duplications
by MLPA analysis. If parental or family members were available, we
performed co-segregation studies by using Sanger Sequencing applying
standard techniques.

Frequency and descriptive analyses were performed using the
statistical software SPSS 9.05 for Windows.

Results
Clinical findings
The study was approved by Dokuz Eylül University School of Medicine
Institute’s Ethics Committee (No: 24/05/2018; 2018/13-38). Fifty-six
patients were evaluated in total. The mean age of patients was 7.92
years (1 to 17). There were 31 boys (55%) and 25 girls (45%). The
consanguinity rate was 38%. Patients with LMNA and
MYOT mutations showed the lowest and patients with
SGCG mutations the highest serum creatine kinase
levels. Our patient collective was drawn up out of patients with the
following mutations: 24 LGMD2C (43%), 7 LGMD2A (13%), 7 LGMD2E (13%),
6 LGMD2D (11%), 3 LGMD2J (5%), 3 LGMD2K (5%), 1 LGMD1B (2%), 1 LGMD1A
(2%), 1 LGMD2B (2%), and 3 unclassified (4%). Difficulty in rising
from the floor, delay in motor milestones, muscle weakness and
HyperCKemia detected in routine laboratory tests were notable
findings. Patients with LGMD2C had a similar disease course as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and all of them had calf hypertrophy. Most
of the patients with LGMD2C were non-ambulatory after age 15.
HyperCKemia detected in routine laboratory tests and mild proximal
muscle weakness were the most common findings in LGMD2A, LGMD2D, and
LGMD2E groups. Scapular winging, atrophy in hamstring muscles and
Achilles contractures were important clinical clues in advanced stages
of LGMD2A patients. Patients with LGMD2K had mild microcephaly,
intellectual disability, and generalized muscle hypertrophy. They were
slower than their peers. Brain magnetic resonance imaging of these
patients was normal. Patients with LGMD2J and LGMD2B presented with
HyperCKemia identified during routine laboratory examinations. A
fifteen-year-old girl (patient no: 21) with LGMD1B presented with a
new onset generalized weakness and she had frequent syncope attacks
since early childhood. She had a positive Gower’s sign and proximal
muscle strength was 4/5 in lower extremities. She had mild pes cavus
deformity and deep tendon reflexes were negative. Her serum creatine
kinase level was normal but the electromyography recording was
myopathic. A first degree atrioventricular block was determined as a
cause of syncope attacks. Her mother and aunt were also treated for
cardiac arrhythmia. A patient with LGMD1A (patient no: 22) presented
mild increased serum creatine kinase level with no clinical findings.
However, her mother and uncle had scapulohumeral weakness and a Gowers
sign. They had a distinctive nasal, dysarthric pattern of speech. They
also had reduced deep tendon reflexes. Their electromyography
recording showed signs of myopathy. We could not make a subgroup
classification in two patients due to lack of all sarcoglycans in one
patient and combined deficiency of gamma and alpha deficiency in the
other patient. Nerve conduction velocities were normal and
electromyography showed myopathic motor unit potentials in all tested
patients.

Muscle biopsy findings
52 patients (93%) had a muscle biopsy. 48 of these biopsies (92%)
showed dystrophic findings including alteration of myofiber size and
shape, splitting, increase in the number of internal nuclei, fiber
type disproportions, regeneration and fibrosis. In the remaining four
patients, muscle biopsy findings were unremarkable. The diagnosis of
these patients with unremarkable biopsy finding were LGMD2C (two
patients), LGMD2D (one patient) and LGMD1B (one patient). Three of
these patients (LGMD2C and 2D) were asymptomatic at the time of muscle
biopsy and muscle biopsy was done due to HyperCKemia (Fig. 1). However, the patient with
LGMD1B was symptomatic at the time of muscle biopsy. Genetically,
these patients were diagnosed with whole exome sequencing. Expression
defects of sarcoglycan staining were as follows: 21 gamma (40%), 6
combined alpha and gamma (12%), 5 calpain (10%), 4 beta (8%), 3 all
sarcoglycans (6%), 2 dysferlin (4%) and 1 alpha-dystroglycan (2%). Ten
patients (20%) showed normal staining for sarcoglycans. We could
compare muscle biopsy and genetic findings in 27 patients. In terms of
dystrophic changes without immunohistochemistry, genetic diagnosis was
obtained in 23 of 27 patients. However, the correlation between
immunohistochemistry and genetic diagnosis was poor. There was a
correlation between genetic diagnosis and immunohistochemistry
findings in only 5/27 patients (patient numbers: 1-5). All of these
patients had a diagnosis of LGMD2C.

Genetic analysis
In twenty-eight patients (50%) the clinical diagnosis could be
confirmed by genetic analysis. 15 of these patients were diagnosed by
whole exome sequencing (WES) or targeted gene sequencing. Results of
genetic analysis were as follows, given the number of patients: 9
SGCG homozygous, 6 SGCA (5
homozygous missense mutation and 1 homozygous 7bp-deletion of exon 3),
3 SGCB (2 homozygous and 1 whole gene deletion), 3
sibling with a novel TTN homozygous, 3
POMT1 homozygous, 1 LMNA
heterozygous, 2 CAPN3 homozygous and 1
MYOT heterozygous (Table 1). The mutation c.107163_107167delTACTT
(NM_001267550.1) in TTN was listed in ClinVar,
however, detailed clinical descriptions were not given (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/196657/)
and there are no scientific publications describing this mutation in
TTN before, this will be the first report to be
published patients with this TTN mutation (Fig. 2). MLPA analysis for the
detection of deletions, duplications and complex rearrangements in the
dystrophin gene were performed and reported as normal for each
case.

Discussion
LGMDs are non-syndromic hereditary muscle disorders limited to
skeletal muscle. Protein testing by immunostaining or immunoblotting on
a muscle biopsy or demonstration of complete or partial deficiencies for
a particular protein followed by mutation studies of the corresponding
gene(s) may establish the diagnosis in most of the cases (1). However, about 50% of currently
identified LGMD would have no molecular diagnosis although all known
genes of LGMD were sequenced by traditionally Sanger Sequencing (1). Turkey is a rich genetic pool for
neuromuscular disorders. In Turkey, 50% of pediatric muscular disorders
consist of patients with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy, which is
followed by LGMD2 (20%) and congenital muscular dystrophy (15%) (6). In a large adult neurology clinic
in Istanbul, 46% of the patients are diagnosed with Duchenne/Becker
muscular dystrophy, followed by facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD)
(18%), myotonic dystrophy (16%) and LGMD2 (14%) (6). Evaluation of 38 LGMD2 families
from Turkey showed that calpainopathy and beta-sarcoglycanopathy were
the most common subtypes. Gamma sarcoglycanopathy was the third common
(7). In our cohort,
gamma-sarcoglycanopathy was the most common (44%) followed by
calpainopathy, beta- and alpha-sarcoglycanopathy. In this cohort,
gamma-sarcoglycanopathy was clinically the most severe group as a whole,
whereas dysferlinopathy was the mildest.

Patients with gamma-sarcoglycanopathy had early onset of symptoms
resembling Duchenne muscular dystrophy and a progressive decline in
motor functions as becoming wheelchair-bound after age 15. All of them
also had gastrocnemius hypertrophy as in Duchenne muscular
dystrophy.

Mild proximal muscle weakness and increased serum creatine kinase
levels incidentally detected during routine laboratory tests were the
main presenting findings in calpainopathy, alpha- and beta-
sarcoglycanopathy patients. A typical appearance for calpainopathy
including generalized atrophy, scapular winging and selective
involvement of hamstring muscles were observed in one of the seven
patients in our cohort. This was related to his advanced age (17 years
old). Patients with dysferlinopathy and LGMD2J were also diagnosed by
idiopathic HyperCKemia because symptoms dominantly involving distal
muscles occur after adolescence. Mutations of POMT1
gene typically lead to Walker Warburg syndrome characterized by severe
muscle, brain and eye involvement. In 2005, Balci et al. described a
form of LGMD2 due to common mutation of POMT1 gene
(p.A200P) characterized by mild mental retardation, microcephaly, and
normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, highly elevated serum creatine
kinase levels and reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan in muscle
biopsy (8). Our patients with
LGMD2K (patient numbers: 26-28) also had the same clinical findings but
we could not show an alpha-dystroglycan deficiency in muscle biopsy due
to the lack of antibody at the time of diagnosis. The patients were
diagnosed by whole exome sequencing.

We only had two patients in the autosomal dominant group. The
patients were clinically asymptomatic only with mildly increased serum
creatine kinase levels. They also had a family history of cardiac
arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy as expected in LGMD1B. The mother and
uncle of the LGMD1A patient had typical scapulohumeral weakness and
myopathic electromyography. The cases with LGMD1A and LGMD1B show the
importance of family history and examination of other family members in
neuromuscular disorders.

Reduced or absent sarcolemmal expression of one of the four
sarcoglycans can be found in patients with any type of
sarcoglycanopathies and dystrophinopathies. Different patterns of
sarcoglycan expression could predict the primary defect but residual
sarcoglycan expression could be highly variable and accurate prediction
of the genotype could not be achieved in most of the cases. Our study
also showed that some patients had combined or total deficiencies of
sarcoglycans in muscle biopsies. We reached a certain diagnosis in these
patients (patient numbers: 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) with genetic
studies but could not classify two patients in a particular group due to
lack of genetic studies. Although there was a good correlation between
dystrophic findings and genetic analysis, this was not valid for
immunohistochemistry findings. All patients with genetic-histologic
correlations were in the gamma-sarcoglycanopathy group (patient numbers:
1-5). However, there were also patients with normal immunostaining for
gamma-sarcoglycan, but mutations in the SGCG gene
(patient numbers: 6, 7, 9). On the other hand, there were also patients
with all defective sarcoglycans in muscle biopsy and single gene
mutation (patient numbers: 8, 10, 13, 15-19). This finding suggests that
muscle biopsy is helpful in terms of dystrophy but defective sarcoglycan
in muscle biopsy should be confirmed genetically. Interestingly, the
muscle biopsy of the index patient with LGMD2J showed dysferlin
deficiency. Histologically, the muscle biopsy of this patient only
revealed a focus with degenerative and regenerative fibers. In this
focus there were macrophages showing myophagia (Fig. 3) However, in the rest of the biopsy there was
no prominent difference between the sizes of myofibers. Although the
absence of calpain-3 has been documented in association with C-terminal
titin mutations due to the loss of calpain-3 binding site in the titin
C-terminus, dysferlin deficiency has not been reported before (9). This novel finding reminds us that
patients with tibial muscular dystrophy who have dysferlin deficiency in
their muscle biopsy but negative genetic analysis results for dysferlin
gene should be checked for TTN mutations. However, this
novel finding should be supported with additional cases and functional
studies in muscle biopsy. So it remains speculative if this is correct
or not.

The autosomal recessive forms represent more than 90% of all LGMDs.
LGMD2A or calpainopathy is considered to be the most common form of
recessive LGMD in most populations, accounting for about 30-40% of the
patients (10). The c.550delA is
the most common mutation among patients from different European
populations (11). A founder
effect for the c.550delA has been reported in some populations like
Russia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Northern Italy and Turkey (10, 12). In 1997, the CAPN3 mutation was
detected in 10 families from Turkey with LGMD2A. The c.550delA mutation
was detected in the half of the families (13). In 2006, Balci et al. revealed 93 Turkish LGMD2
families and detected CAPN3 mutations in 29 patients
from 21 families (10). In this
study, c.550delA mutation was the most common followed by c.1469G>A
(p.R490Q) mutation. In our study, we detected c.2243G>A (p.R748Q)
mutation in two siblings. This mutation had been reported in several
Spanish patients and also previously in one patient from Turkey (13, 14).

The four common types of LGMD are called sarcoglycanopathies; LGMD2C
(SGCG), LGMD2D (SGCA), LGMD2E
(SGCB) and LGMD2F (SGCD) (15). The frequencies of mutations in
SGCA and SGCD are respectively the
highest and lowest in most populations. A clinical study from Iran
evaluating 25 sarcoglycanopathy patients showed that more than the half
of the patients had SGCB mutations followed by
SGCG (28%), SGCD (12%) and
SGCA (4%) mutations (16). In India, mutation frequencies regarding
sarcoglycanopathies were reported as SGCG 44.4%,
SGCD 27.8% and SGCB 5.6% (12). In our study
SGCG mutation (9 patients, 31%) was the most common.
The frequencies of SGCA and SGCB
mutations were 20% (6 patients) and 10% (3 patients), respectively.
Mutations in sarcoglycan genes are commonly small defects, such as short
deletions/insertions or single nucleotide substitutions (17). The majority of
sarcoglycanopathies are associated with missense mutations but large
deletions had also been reported (18, 19).
More than 70 pathogenic mutations had been described in
SGCA (20). The
most common mutation of this gene is p.R77C which has a founder effect
in Finland and Magdalen (12).
This mutation was also reported as a founder mutation in several LGMD2D
patients from Europe and also Brazil (20). Other founder mutations are p.R34L in Taiwan and
p.R192* in Egypt (10). In our
LGMD2D patients, we found five different mutations in 6 patients. These
mutations had previously been described (2, 19, 21-23). LGMD2E is a
clinically heterogeneous disorder associated with missense, truncating
and deletion mutations in SGCB located on the 4q12
chromosomal region. Large homozygous microdeletion of chromosome
4q11-q12 and isolated exon deletion had also been reported (24). The founder mutations of
SGCB are c.377_384dup in Northern Italy and p.T151R in
Amish population. The p.M1L, p.Q11*, p.V89M, p.I92T, p.I92S and
c.739insA mutations had been reported from Turkey (25). In this study, the patient with whole gene
deletion (patient no: 13) had previously been reported by Diniz at al.
(26). The p.V89M mutation (1
patient) had been reported in the Turkish population and p.C307R
mutation (1 patient) had been presented as a poster presentation in
1st National Neuromuscular Disease Congress in Ankara, 2017
(25, 27). The reported founder mutations of
SGCG are c.525delT in North Africans, p.C283Y in Roma
Gypsies and c.87insT in Northern Italy. Especially the high prevalence
of the c.525delT mutation, which is also called the Maghrebian form
(formerly name delta521T) present as a founder mutation in North Africa
and Spain, can be an indicator of the migratory movement in
Mediterranean Sea. (6). The
frameshift mutation c.800_801GT (formerly 923-924TG) in the (TG) 4
repeat in the 3’ coding area and deletion of exon 5 of the
SGCG gene (formerly described as 510del120) had been
reported from Turkey (13, 28). Another study evaluating 20
LGMD2C patients from Turkey showed most patients had silent homozygous
or heterozygous mutations (2).
In our study, 5 mutations were found in 9 patients. The most common
mutation was c.525delT which was found in 5/9 patients. Patients with
c.800_801delGT mutations had been reported previously (2). Additionally, p.C283Y (1 patient)
and p.R34H (1 patient) mutations had also been described previously
(18, 29).

Titin is a giant muscle protein expressed in cardiac and striated
muscles. It spans half of the sarcomere from Z line to M line. It plays
major functions in muscle assembly, force transmission and maintenance
of resting tension. Its gene is located on 2q31.2 and encodes the
largest protein of the human genome (15). More than 230 mutations of TTN
have been reported in human gene mutation database (HGMD) (30). Mutations of this gene cause
tibial muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy 1G, familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, early onset myopathy with fatal
cardiomyopathy, proximal myopathy with early respiratory muscle
involvement and LGMD2J (15).
Symptoms in LGMD2J start in the first or second decade and progresses
over the next 20 years to wheelchair confinement. We detected a novel
homozygous mutation c.107163_107167delTACTT (NM_ 001267550.2) in three
siblings (patient number: 23-25). The index patient was diagnosed due to
idiopathic HyperCKemia. She is currently 17 years old. The symptoms
started at the age of 14 years. She has symmetric weakness prominent in
distal lower extremity muscle and she has difficulty while walking on
heels. Upper extremity, axial and facial muscles are not involved. There
are no signs of cardiac and respiratory dysfunctions. Serum creatine
kinase level is 2939 IU/L. Her younger siblings are asymptomatic.

Mutations in POMT1, which mapped to chromosome
9q34.13, are related to autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies which
include three subgroups as MDDGA1, MDDGB1 and MDDGC1 (also known as
LGMD2K) (31). The
Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) is the most severe phenotype but patients
with milder mutations in POMT1 might present with
milder forms of LGMD (31).
While there is not any clear genotype-phenotype correlation, the
variable phenotypic severity can be related to the type and location of
the mutations (31). The POMT1
protein has loops within the lumen (loops 1, 3 and 5) and within the
cytoplasm (loops 2, 4 and 6). Patients with mutations only affecting the
loops within the cytoplasm are more likely to show the milder phenotype
of LGMD. Mutations affecting the transmembrane domains, loop 1 and loop
5 within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum are associated with the
more severe clinical presentation of congenital muscular dystrophy
(32). Two
POMT1 mutations had been reported from Turkey. One of
them was a p.R514* mutation in a patient with Walker-Warburg syndrome.
This mutation affects the loop of protein within the lumen of the
endoplasmic reticulum (33). The
other reported mutation was p.A200P mutation leading to a significantly
milder clinical phenotype with predominant muscular dystrophy and mild
intellectual disability, but without obvious brain malformations (8). The second reported mutation
affects the part of protein within the cytoplasm. Herein we reported
three patients (patient number: 26-28) with a previously reported
homozygous p.A647T mutation which affects loop 6(34). They shared a similar phenotype with patients
reported by Balci et al. in 2005(8).

LGMD1B is caused by LMNA which is located on
1q22.15. Mutations of this gene are associated with a wide range of
disease phenotypes, ranging from cardiac, neuromuscular and metabolic
disorders to premature aging syndromes. Muscular dystrophies associated
with LMNA are autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy, a form of congenital muscular dystrophy and LGMD1B.
It is difficult to establish a correlation between phenotype and
genotype (35). However, these
clinical entities can be determined by the same LMNA
mutation and coexist in the context of the same family (36). Some LMNA
mutations had been reported from Turkey before. The p.Glu31del mutation
had been reported in a patient with LMNA-CMD and others
including p.D47N, p.R349W, p.R482W, p.A527H, and p.A529V had been
reported in patients with lipodystrophy mandibuloacral dysplasia (37-42).
Herein we reported LMNA mutations in a patient with
LGMD1B for the first time from Turkey (patient number: 21). The
mutations p.L245P been reported as a poster presentation in
12th European Pediatric Neurology Congress in Lyon/France.
The phenotype of this patient included proximal muscle weakness with
normal serum creatine kinase, pes cavus, foot-drop gait, absent deep
tendon reflexes and first degree A-V block (43).

LGMD1A is caused by mutations in MYOT gene localized
on the 5q31.2 chromosomal region. Mutation of MYOT also
causes myofibrillar myopathy (44). We detected p.S55F mutation in one patient
(patient number: 22). This young girl had mild serum creatine kinase
elevation but had no clinical findings of a muscle disease yet. However,
her mother and uncle had typical findings of LGMD1A. This mutation had
also previously been reported in an Argentinian family with LGMD1A
(45). The clinical findings in
the Argentinian family started by 42-58 years of age with proximal leg
and arm weakness which later progressed to distal weakness. Half of the
patients had dysarthric speech and serum CK levels were elevated to
5-fold to 15- fold. The clinical findings of the index case’s mother and
uncle were similar in this family, however, symptoms started in the
second decade. Their serum CK never exceeded 1000 IU/l.

Gamma sarcoglycanopathies were the most common LGMD in Aegean part of
Turkey like Spain and North Africa. For example in Tunisia, the
frequency of LGMD2 is higher than for dystrophinopathies and LGMD2C is
the most common type (6). About
90% of the cases with LGMD2C carry c.525delT exon 6 founder mutation. In
the Catalan part of Spain, LGMD2C is the most common type of LGMD2 and
interestingly 50% of their gamma-sarcoglycan mutations is the Maghrebian
form as c.525delT (6). In our
study, 55% of our cases with LGMD2C also carried c.525delT mutation.
These findings suggest that the Aegean part of the Turkey has probably
been influenced by migrations in the Mediterranean see from a genetic
epidemiologic point of view.

SGCA, SGCB, SGCD, SGCG, CAPN3, LMNA, and
POMT1 mutations have been reported in LGMD patients
from Turkey (2, 7, 8, 10, 13, 20, 21,
26-28). Rare types
of childhood-onset LGMD2 due to mutations of TRAPPC11,
POMK, and PLEC were also reported from Turkey
(46-48). Molecular
genetic diagnosis of LGMD remains challenging. Recently, clinicians
consider multi-gene panels or whole exome sequencing (WES) for genetic
diagnosis of LGMD. The diagnostic rate of WES ranges between 34% and 45%
(49). Next-generation
sequencing has the advantage of detecting a mutation in a very large
gene like TTN (50). In our cohort, more than half of the cases with
the genetic diagnosis had been solved by WES.

In conclusion, LGMD2C is the most common LGMD2 in the Aegean part of
Turkey. Most of the childhood cases present with mild proximal muscle
weakness and increased serum creatine kinase levels detected during
routine laboratory examinations. Results of immunostaining of muscle
biopsies should be confirmed with molecular genetic testing because
there is a very limited correlation between immunohistochemical and
genetic findings. Whole exome sequencing confirms the diagnosis in most
of the cases with nonspecific clinical and muscle biopsy findings.

Supplement 1 Details of muscle biopsy
Samples were frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and 8 to
12 micron sections were cut using the cryostat. Slides were stained with
hematoxylin&eosin, Gomori’s trichrome, modified Gomori’s trichrome
(Engel-Cunningham modification), oil red-O, Periodic Acid Shiff (PAS),
d-PAS, crystal violet stains. For enzyme histochemical techniques we
used nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR),
succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome oxidase (COX) and combined
COX- SDH stains. Spectrin (Novo-castra, UK, NCL-spec1), dystrophin
N-terminus (Novo-castra, UK, NCL-dys3), adhalin (Novocastra, UK,
NCL-a-sarc), other sarcoglycans (beta, delta, gamma; Novo-castra, UK,
NCL-b-d-g-sarc), laminin alpha-2 chain (Novo-castra, UK, NCL-merosin),
myotilin (Novo-castra, UK, NCL-myotilin), collagen VI (Novocastra, UK,
NCL-COLL-vI), β-dystroglycan (Novocastra, UK, NCL-b-DG), HLA Class 1
(Novo-castra, UK, NCL-HLA-ABC), NCAM (ThermoScientific, CA, USA, CD56),
nitric oxide synthase-1 (Novo-castra, UK, NCLNOS-1), emerin
(Novo-castra, UK, NCL-emerin), caveolin 3 (Novus Biologicals, CA, USA,
NB110-5029), calpain 3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab103250) and dysferlin
(Novo-castra, UK, NCL-Hamlet-2) antibodies were used by standard
techniques for immunohistochemical analyses. Myosin heavy chain fast
(Novo-castra, UK, NCL-MHCf) antibody was used for discriminating between
fiber types, and myosin heavy chain neonatal (Novo-castra, UK, NCL-MHCn)
antibody was used for identification of immature fibers. Monoclonal
antibodies against T-cells (CD3), B-cells (CD 20), macrophages (CD68),
suppressor T cells (CD8) and helper T cells (CD4) were used in selected
cases for the identification of the inflammatory cell spectrum (2).

Figure 1. The muscle biopsy of the patient with the genetically confirmed
LGMD2D showing no sign of dystrophy (A) and normal
expression of all sarcoglycans (B, C, D, E). The biopsy
was taken at the age of 8 years.

Figure 2. Pedigree of the family with TTN mutation. Homozygous frameshift
mutation, g.2:179393311-179393315, c.107163_107167delTACTT,
NM_001267550.1, Located in exon 361 of LRG 391_t1, encoding IgG-like
domain 150, maps to M-Band in the Sarcomere, reference Sequence with
deleted bp kursiv: TCTCTTTACTTGTGAAAT.

Figure 3. The muscle biopsy of the index patient showed a complete deficiency
of dysferlin immunohistochemically (A). The positive
simultaneously stained control slide of another patient’s biopsy
reveals a complete sarcolemmal staining of the dysferlin antibody
(B). There was only one focus with degenerative and
regenerative fibers. In this focus, there were also macrophages
showing myophagia (C). The muscle biopsy was taken at the
age of 17 years from the left quadriceps femoris.
