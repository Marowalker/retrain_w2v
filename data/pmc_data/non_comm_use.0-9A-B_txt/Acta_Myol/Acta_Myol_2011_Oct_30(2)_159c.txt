==== Body
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing several subtypes. In our patients population, the most numerous and homogeneous group is represented by patients with a late onset, seropositive, non-thymomatous MG (LO-Ab+noTh). We have analyzed the frequency of HLA-A, -B, - DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 alleles in 81 unselected Italian MG patients and in 100 healthy controls. HLA allele frequencies were estimated by direct count and compared in a 2 Ã— 2 contingency table analysis using the Fisher exact test; p values were corrected for multiple comparisons according to the Bonferroni method (pc). When the entire MG population was considered, no association was found between the occurrence of the disease and the presence of any of the alleles analyzed. However, when the LO-Ab+noTh patients were compared to controls, a positive association of the DRB1*16 and the DQB1*0502 alleles was observed (pc 0,0211 and 0,00768 respectively). On the contrary, the same association was not present in patients with either early-onset, seropositive, non-thymomatous MG, or with thymomatous MG. The association of DRB1*16 and DQB1*0502 with MG has been previously reported in Italian patients with different features, but not in LO-Ab+noTh MG. According to these results, DRB1*16 and DQB1*05:02 might be considered as genetic markers of LO-Ab+noTh MG, while their role as predisposing genetic factors for MG should be clarified by further investigations.
