==== Body
Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal disorder of muscle glycogen metabolism due to alfa-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency. The prevalence of this disease is estimated to be 1:40.000.

Since 2006, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) became available in Europe and US. So far, there are no officially approved international guidelines about ERT inclusion criteria of patients but they must have a defined diagnosis of Pompe disease confirmed by a biochemical and molecular genetic examinations (1).

So far, ERT has been generally prescribed to patients with motor symptoms (muscle weakness) and/or respiratory involvement.

Exclusion criteria encompassed a severe associated illness which would be expected to greatly shorten life expectancy.

Alglucosidase (Myozyme) is administered biweekly i.v. as 20 mg/kg. Although the high costs of the drug, in several European countries the patients are fully supported by their Ministries of Health.

In fact, in Belgium, National guidelines consider every patient with clinical symptoms of muscle and/or respiratory involvement as a candidate for ERT that, on the other hand, should not be started in patients showing neither a clinical impact of the disease or with a limited life expectancy.

In the Netherlands, the inclusion criteria are the confirmation of diagnosis via enzyme assay and mutation analysis, and patients should have demonstrable muscle weakness and/or pulmonary function < 80%.

In UK, specific guidelines, prepared by a multidisciplinary group (2007), included patients with muscle weakness and/or respiratory compromise leading to an impaired quality of life as candidate for treatment.

In France, Pompe disease experts recommend to treat symptomatic patients (muscle weakness and/or respiratory involvement - FVC < 80%).

In Germany and in Poland there is a generic recommendation to treat symptomatic patients.

In addition, in Brazil there is a recommendation to treat symptomatic patients; mild cases have to be progressively followed by respiratory and /or muscular functional tests and/or by muscle MRI before starting ERT.

Because of the high costs of ERT, in several countries Health authorities (and EMA in Europe) request precise data concerning the clinical effects and safety of ERT to reimburse the treatment.

Given the data obtained in different cohorts of patients, treated with ERT, there is a clear evidence that alglucosidase improves the walking distance and stabilizes the pulmonary function. A precise monitoring should help to make a decision for initiating or even interrupt ERT

Patients should be followed in specialized neuromuscular or metabolic Departments, in connection with a pulmonology unit.

Follow-up visits should be organized every 6 months or once a year with clinical evaluations performed by expert physicians and trained physiotherapists; those results should be collected on dedicated data base/registries.

To date, there is a need of specific outcome measures to monitor patients before treatment and during the follow up.

Across various European countries and US, clinical assessment has been differentially monitored. In fact 6 MWT, MMT, MFM scale, timed tests (i.e. GSGC), WGMS, muscle MRI, SF- 36, have been applied every 3-6 months/1 year to patients.

Since 2006, AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) has approved alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme) for the treatment of Pompe disease patients in Italy, either for infantile or late-onset patients.

The authorisation to treat patients by ERT has to be given by Centres specialized in rare diseases. Every Centre must assess the diagnosis of Pompe disease with absolute certainty before starting treatment.

In 2008, a group of Italian Pompe disease experts reviewed, from a multidisciplinary point of view, the current practices in diagnosis, management and treatment of Pompe disease (2). The main criteria for starting ERT included: 1) confirmed diagnosis; 2) symptoms and clinical signs of muscle weakness and or respiratory insufficiency; 3) in cases of asymptomatic hyperckemia, a 6-months follow up was suggested in an attempt to monitor clinically relevant changes leading to treatment.

The standard protocol mainly includes evaluation of muscle strength, respiratory assessment and skeletal muscle MRI that has been applied to 74 patients treated with ERT coming from 18 different Italian Centres, recently described by Angelini et al. (3).

Nowadays, general recommendations includes monitoring of limb muscles and respiratory functions every 6 months using timed tests and functional scales. Muscle MRI may constitute an important tool to check the progression of intramuscular fat replacement in the patients (4).

Respiratory function should include at least assessment of upright and supine FVC. Other important aspects of the disease to be considered are the cardiac function (ECG once a year) as well as antiRhGAA antibodies (every 3 months) levels, Glc4 (the only available biomarker of muscle glycogenosis type II) and brain MRI if there are symptoms suggestive of CNS involvement.

In conclusion, being available the ERT therapy, it is really important to diagnose Pompe disease as soon as possible to avoid respiratory and skeletal muscle degeneration.
