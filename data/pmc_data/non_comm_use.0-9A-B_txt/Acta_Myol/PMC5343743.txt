==== Body
In the recent years the field of neuromuscular diseases with onset in childhood has been revolutionized by the discovery of several new genes and the underlying mechanisms responsible for diseases. With this perspective the conference "News and Views. Neuromuscular disease from child to adulthood: new tools and new opportunities" was held in Pisa at the end of last September.

Starting from the latest scientific advances in the most common neuromuscular diseases, the conference addressed the need to integrate the disciplines and the clinicians daily involved in taking care of patients with these diseases, focusing in particular on the phase of transition from childhood to adulthood.

The present issue of Acta Myologica and the next at the end of the year will collect a series of interventions presented during the conference. The October issue reports two contributions, one on the aspects related to learning disabilities in children with neuromuscular diseases and their potential effects on the young adult skills, the other on the complex vision of the integration of psychosocial aspects and burden in families with patients affected by neuromuscular disorders. The December issue will publish other presentations on the topics of the days of the conference.
