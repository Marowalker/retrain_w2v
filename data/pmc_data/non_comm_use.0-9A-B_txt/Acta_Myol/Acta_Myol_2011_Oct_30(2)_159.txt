==== Body
Laminopathies are a group of genetic diseases caused by mutations in the nuclear protein lamin A/C or in related proteins. A group of laminopathies targets specific tissues – tissuespecific laminopathies –, other laminopathies affect multiple tissues – systemic laminopathies.

The Italian Network for Laminopathies is a group of Clinical and Research Centers performing clinical and molecular diagnosis or biomedical research in the field of laminopathies. Aims of the Italian Network for laminopathies are: to connect Italian Centers involved in diagnosis and biomedical research of laminopathies; provide information on the clinical features of Laminopathies to family doctors, specialists and patients; provide the contact information of specialists involved in the diagnosis and research of laminopathies; provide updated information on biomedical research in the field of laminopathies; organize an Italian Registry for Laminopathies containing clinical and biological data; establish a bank of biological material; report news on relevant events and meetings; report on funding opportunities in the field of Laminopathies research.

The Italian Network for Laminopathies website provides updated information of the Network and of Laminopathies-related events.
