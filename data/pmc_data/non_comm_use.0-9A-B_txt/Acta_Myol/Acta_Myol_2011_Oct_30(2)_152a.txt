==== Body
The most prevalent fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAO) in adults are carnitine palmitoyl transferase II (CPTII), very-long chain Acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (VLCAD) and multiple Acyl- Coa dehydrogenase (MAD) deficiencies. 

Proposed treatment strategies for FAO defects include avoidance of exacerbating factors, carnitine supplementation, riboflavin treatment and dietary modifications (medium-chain triglycerides and triheptanoin). Riboflavin treatment may induce a dramatic improvement of muscle symptoms and encephalopathy in some patients with riboflavin-responsive MAD deficiency.

Children with long-chain FAO defects are generally treated with a low long-chain fat diet and supplements of MCT, but the evidence for benefit is less convincing in patients whose problems are recurrent rhabdomyolysis. A remarkable improvement of cardiac and muscular symptoms occurred in three children with VLCAD deficiency and in seven patients with CPTII deficiency after dietary supplementation with triheptanoin, a seven-carbon medium-chain fatty acid, which supposed mechanisms are the production of C5 ketone bodies and propionyl-CoA, allowing to replenish the pool of catalytic intermediates of the citric acid cycle. Further clinical trials and prolonged clinical follow-up are needed to confirm the benefit of these treatments.

A recently tested alternative way to treat FAO disorders are agonists of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs), that are potent pharmaceutical tools stimulating FAO enzymes in a wide variety of cells. Recent data showed in vivo correction of CPT II and VLCAD deficiency in cultured patients' fibroblasts, with bezafibrate a widely prescribed hypolipidemic drug. The potential for bezafibrate to correct inborn FAO disorders, has already conducted to the achievement of a pilot clinical trial in 6 adults with CPT II deficiency showing a clear improvement of FAO in muscle.

Another potential target for improving FAO oxidation is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Exercise, some drugs (metformine, rosiglitazone), and hormones such as leptin and adiponectine are known activators of AMPK in skeletal muscle and increase FAO in muscle. The development of new drugs modulating the activity of AMPK could also open new avenues for the treatment of FAO disorders.
