==== Body
The aim was to define a multifunctional evaluation protocol in patients with Mc Ardle's disease in order to detect and quantify the impairment of both muscular energetic metabolism and motor performance. The protocol has been used to investigate the effect of a carbohydrate-rich diet integrated with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and creatine on exercise intolerance and motor skills in these patients.

We studied 4 patients with complete myophosphorylase deficiency, 1 paucisymptomatic patient with partial myophosphorylase deficiency and 5 sex- and age-matched healty subjects, who have been evaluated by: 1) monitoring of physical activity with an electronic armband; 2) testing of cardiopulmonary, metabolic and respiratory responses to exercise with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in wich subjects were asked to pedal on a bicycle ergometer, using a costant workload for 12 minutes followed by an incremental workload to exhaustion; 3) examination of oxidative stress biomarkers (AOPP and thiols) at rest and during exercise.

The same measurements were then repeated by the patients after three days of carbohydrate-rich diet (20% fat, 15% protein and 64% carbohydrate) integrated with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and creatine.

The monitoring with armband showed that low levels of physical activity are prominent in patients with Mc Ardle's disease. During the costant workload exercise on the bicycle ergometer 3 patients experienced the characteristic "second wind", whereas in the patient with partial myophosphorylase deficiency (patient carrier) heart rate increased progressively, as in all the healty subjects. Heart rate was consistently lower in healty subjects then in patients, indicating that they were performing at a higher percentage of their exercise reserve. Maximal oxygen uptake was significantly lower in patients (p < 0.05), showing how Mc Ardle's disease has a significant effect on the maximal oxidative capacity. The sampling of oxidative stress biomarkers (AOPP and thiols) blood levels showed lower levels of AOPP and higher levels of thiols in patients than in healty subjects.

We did not observe significant differences between baseline and the results obtained after three days of carbohydrate-rich diet integrated with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and creatine.

The protocol has confirmed the impairment of both anaerobic and oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle. The sensitivity of the test allowed to appreciate the "second wind" phenomenon and to detect the case of the carrier patient, who had intermediate phenotypic characteristics between patients and healty subjects; by the way the test could be useful to obtain an objective, quantitative and longitudinal evaluation of the impairment to be used in the follow-up of patients with Mc Ardle's disease as well as in the assessment of therapeutic interventions.
