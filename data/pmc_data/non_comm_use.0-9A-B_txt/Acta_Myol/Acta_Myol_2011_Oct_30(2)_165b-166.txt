The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of professional teams from medical institutions in Bay of Kotor (Montenegro) to carry out the rehabilitation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in the optimal way.

Another patient (with spinal muscular atrophy type 3) was followed for 3 years.

Muscular dystrophy, as a group of muscle diseases characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of the muscles responsible for body movements, fortunately, is not a common disease in the region of the Bay of Kotor.

In first case an initial muscle weakness was noticed at age 3. Diagnostics(high levels of serum creatine phosphokinase,genetical testing which confirmed the deletion of dystrophin gene,EMG, biopsy, and a confirmation that the mother is the carrier) was made in his fifth year.

Abnormality was noticed during running, jumping and standing up (with Gowers maneuver). Other development of weakness in lower extremities, joint contractures, scoliosis. Until the age of 10 the patient had been sent out annually to a stationary physical therapy professionally led with education of the mother. He also took adequate doses of prednisolone intermittently. Since year 11 he was wheelchair-bound.

A patient with Kugelberg Welander spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3 noticed the first symptoms (fatigue of gaiter muscles during walking) in age 12. After the diagnostics the only possible treatment was started -physical therapy (in hospital and at home).He still walks independently. Other neuromuscular diseases are sporadic and very rarely seen in our region.

In neuromuscular diseases maximizing the use of rehabilitation procedures with all medical supplies is necessary, so that the patient would be able to move independently for longer.

To the satisfaction of professional teams (pediatricians, neurologists,physiatrists, orthopedists, physical therapists and medical technicians) in Montenegro, rehabilitation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in recent years is being organized better than before, despite bad socio-economic conditions. It has implemented in the special institutions located on the coast.

The cost of treatment is covered by health insurance and is continued in health centers, at home of patients and in the inclusive school departments. Patients with neuromuscular diseases from other (mostly rural) areas are also allowed to rehabilitate in these institutions.
