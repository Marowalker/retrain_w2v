==== Body
The RYR1 gene encodes the skeletal muscle isoform ryanodine receptor which is fundamental for excitation-contraction coupling and calcium homeostasis of skeletal muscle.

Mutations in RYR1 are associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH), Central core (CCD) and Multiminicore (MMC) myopathies.

CCD is characterised by the presence of amorphous areas (cores) that lack mitochondria and oxidative enzyme activity especially in type I muscle fibres. Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, although there are some instances of autosomal recessive transmission.

MMC is characterized by multiple, small areas with disorganization of myofibrillar structure and absence of mitochondria. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.

To obtain a more complete molecular characterization of CCD and MMC, we analysed RYR1 by direct sequencing, DHPLC and MLPA techniques, in 15 Italian patients with clinical and histological diagnosis of CM. 13 variants previously not reported were identified. All the mutations met accepted, consensus criteria for pathogenicity.

Our study expands the spectrum of RYR1 mutations, emphasizes the importance of a complete gene analysis in the Italian population, and proposes further heterogeneity in CM.
