and peripheral neurological complications such as meningitis,
encephalitis, myelitis and radiculopathy in 0.5-7.5% of patients
(1). The peripheral nervous system manifestations of acute
EBV infection include mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex,
autonomic neuropathy, and polyradiculopathy (2). Brachial plexopathy
in children and immunocompromised adults with acute
EBV infection has been described, likely as a dysimmune neuropathy
triggered by the EBV (3, 4). We present a case of brachial
plexopathy complicating prior EBV infection in a healthy adult.

Case report
A previously healthy, 26-year-old female presented
with a three-month history of slowly progressive weakness
and wasting of her left hand muscles. Two-three
weeks prior to the onset of the weakness, she had a severe
flu-like illness lasting for seven days with full recovery.
She did not have shoulder, scapular or neck pain. The
patient noted numbness in the tips of her fingers, but no
other sensory symptoms. She did not have bulbar or constitutional
symptoms. Her symptoms had progressed for
3 months and then stabilized during the 3 months before
initial assessment. Examination showed normal cranial
nerves; specifically, Horner’s syndrome was not present.
She had severe atrophy of the left intrinsic and hypothenar
muscles and mild atrophy of the thenar muscles.
Power in left hand muscles was reduced: finger extensors
grade 4, intrinsic hand muscles grade 2 (in keeping with
atrophy), thenar muscles grade 3- (not proportional to the
atrophy) on the MRC scale. All other muscle groups were
normal. Pinprick sensation was reduced over the palmar
aspect of the left fourth and fifth digits. The neurological
examination, including deep tendon reflexes, was otherwise
normal.

Nerve conduction studies were abnormal in the left
arm with low amplitudes of the evoked motor responses,
more evident with proximal stimulation with possible
multilevel conduction blocks of the left ulnar nerve,
across Erb’s point, in the axilla and in the forearm. The
median and ulnar nerve F wave responses were absent.
Distal motor latencies were prolonged. Sensory nerve
conduction studies demonstrated low amplitude of the ulnar
sensory nerve action and slowing of the ulnar sensory
nerve conduction velocity. Median sensory nerve conduction
studies were normal. Nerve conduction studies in
the right arm were normal. The left medial antebrachial
sensory nerve conduction study was normal as well (Table
1). Electromyography showed reduced recruitment
in the extensor digitorum communis, abductor pollicis
brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscles.
Chronic neurogenic type motor units with increased amplitudes,
prolonged durations and polyphasic morphology
were present in the left FDI and APB muscles. Fibrillation
potentials and positive sharp waves were noted in the
left FDI (1+), but not in other muscles. More proximal
muscles of the left arm were normal. These studies indicated
the presence of a left brachial plexopathy with primarily
demyelinating features given the lack of frequent
abnormal spontaneous activity on electromyography, the
discrepancy between atrophy and strength on clinical examination,
the prolongation of distal motor latencies, the
reduced conduction velocities, the loss of F waves and
the conduction block. Imaging of the brachial plexus was
done to exclude a compressive lesion such as thoracic
outlet syndrome although the nerve conduction studies
showed a multilevel process of the ulnar nerve in the extremity
and distal median nerve impairment.

An MRI of the left brachial plexus was normal, without
evidence of compression, but showed diffuse bilateral
lymphadenopathy involving the neck, supraclavicular and axial regions (Fig. 1). The appearance suggested a
diagnosis of lymphoma, and the patient was referred for
lymph node biopsy that showed evidence of Epstein -
Barr virus infection, but not lymphoma (Fig. 2). Serology
was positive for EBV and CMV IgG, and HBs antibodies.
Other lab tests were unremarkable, including TSH, ESR,
ANA, vitamin B12, serum protein electrophoresis, Lyme
titres, A1C, FBS, CBC, creatinine, liver function tests,
rheumatoid factor, anti-ds DNA, C3, and C4 complement
levels. Anti-GM1 Ganglioside antibodies were negative.

The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin,
2G/kg, without effect and with physiotherapy.
She declined other interventions due to concerns about
losing time from work. She is now 18 months following
the onset of her neurological illness and remains stable.

Discussion
The literature contains a few case reports of radiculoplexopathy
complicating acute EBV infection in children
(3, 4). The prognosis for recovery was good in these
cases. Our case is unique in that the brachial plexopathy
occurred in an adult and her course is not as benign as previously
described. Vucic et al. have reported a case similar
to ours of brachial plexopathy in an adult with acute EBV infection (5). Our case differs in the prolonged temporal
course between infection and weakness, complete
lack of pain, and lack of improvement at 18 months after
onset. It is unique as being the first case of a biopsy documented
EBV lympho-adenopathy associated with painless
focal amyotrophy. It is interesting to speculate about
the mechanism of nerve injury in our patient. Compression
by the lymphadenopathy should be considered due to
the extensive nature of the lymph node enlargement and
the involvement of the lower part of the brachial plexus
presenting as a thoracic outlet syndrome. Still, the brachial plexus involvement is of the lower plexus only and
the lymphadenopathy is extensive. This discrepancy and
the lack of pain suggest that compression is not the most
likely mechanism. Post-infectious demyelination caused
by EBV infection analogous to brachial neuritis needs to
be considered. Confounding both of these diagnoses is
the lack of pain at any time during the course of her illness.
Furthermore, post-infectious brachial plexopathies
more typically involve upper parts of the plexus.

Other diagnosis that we considered in this patient
were: monomelic amyotrophy/Hirayama disease in
which a history of progression for several years prior to
stabilization and a lack lymphadenopathy and demyelination
on nerve conduction studies are expected; multifocal
motor neuropathy characterized by lack of sensory
involvement and positive response to IVIG; multifocal
CIDP characterized by response to IVIG and lack of EB
positive lymphadenopathy; and hereditary predisposition
to pressure palsies with expected positive family history,
conduction blocks at compressive sites, and histories of
nerve palsies with spontaneous improvement. Our patient
did not have the characteristics of these disorders but had
onset of her neurological disorder 2-3 weeks after a viral
infection suggesting a causal relationship and points out
the need to include EBV infection with lymphadenopathy
in the differential diagnosis of lesions involving the lower
trunk of the brachial plexus and presenting with painless
amyotrophy of the hand.
