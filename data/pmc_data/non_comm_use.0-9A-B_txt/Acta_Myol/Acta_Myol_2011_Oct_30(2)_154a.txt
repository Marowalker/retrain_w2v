==== Body
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects motor neurons. It is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1). The SMN2 gene, which is the highly homologous SMN1 copy that is present in all patients, is unable to prevent the disease. SMA patients can be classified into four groups based on age at onset and acquired milestones (type I or severe acute disease, with onset before 6 months; type II, before 18 months; type III, after 18 months and type IV, in adult life). The explanation for the neuromuscular phenotype in SMA is to assume that insufficient SMN protein causes motor neuron dysfunction and death, and that muscle atrophy
  is a consequence of denervation. However, investigation is ongoing to ascertain whether muscle, neuromuscular junctions, or motor neurons alone are the critical target tissue in SMA. The neuropathologic description of SMA comes largely from postnatal necropsy samples, which describe the end-stage of the disease. The human developmental period appears to play an essential role in SMA pathogenesis. With the exception of severe congenital SMA (type 0), varying age at onset in the four SMA types provides evidence of a latency period without clear manifestations in most SMA patients. Given that studies of patients' preclinical status are lacking, the main objective of our work is to study SMA during development to gain insight into the mechanism of disease in the prenatal and presymptomatic stage. Prenatal SMN tests performed at around 11-13 weeks allowed us to identify fetuses predicted to develop SMA in families with a previous patient affected by type I disease. SMA fetuses were collected from therapeutic abortions after confirmation of a homozygous deletion of exon 7 and 8 of the SMN gene by chorionic villi DNA analysis. In these samples we systematically studied histology, cell death and gene and protein expression in spinal cord and muscle, the key tissues involved in the disease. The study of terminal peripheral nerves and neuromuscular junctions identify possible links between the two tissues in the pathogenesis of the disease. By confocal and electron microscopy we observed a variable degree of changes in the acetylcholine receptors clustering, presynaptic retention of vesicles and terminal nerve degeneration in the motor endplates of fetuses with severe SMA. Furthermore, ultrasound fetal movements were investigated at these stages. At the gestational age examined, we did not observe a qualitative early limitation of movements in fetuses with SMA. Our results support the view of SMA as a developmental disorder and the hypothesis that motor neurons, terminal peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions and skeletal muscle may play all together a role in the pathology of SMA. These studies may help to define therapeutic targets and delineate a possible early intervention in SMA.
