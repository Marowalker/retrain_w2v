==== Body
I have the great pleasure to present the first 2012 issue of Acta Myologica. The high level of this issue was reached thanks to the outstanding work of my dear friends Reinhardt RÃ¼del (Ulm) and Luisa Politano (Naples), who gave many important and impressive suggestions to all the Co-Authors of this issue. Furthermore I am happy to start a new section of Acta Myologica that will host the "memories" of outstanding myologists. In the present issue we have the great opportunity to publish the contribute of Yves Rideau. His precious "Memories of a Myologist" allow us to understand what he did, first in the world, in helping the patients affected by muscle diseases, particularly for respiratory and surgical problems, teaching us that each scientist and physician must first be a friend of the patient and his family.

Finally, as started last year, we host the proceedings of the annual Congress of the Italian Association of Myology, now in its twelfth edition.
