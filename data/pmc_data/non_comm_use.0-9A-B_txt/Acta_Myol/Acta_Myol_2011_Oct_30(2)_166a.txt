==== Body
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies have similar signs and symptoms and are caused by different mutations in the same gene. The two conditions differ in their severity, age of onset, and rate of progression. The signs and symptoms of Becker muscular dystrophy are usually milder and exhibit a large range of variation. In most cases, muscle weakness becomes apparent later in childhood or adolescence and progresses at a much slower rate. Individuals can remain ambulatory into their 40s. Despite the milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death, in the mid-40s. Two hot-spots BMD mutations have been described, at the 5' end of the dystrophin gene, comprising exons 2 to 11 and at the 44-45 exon level.The most part of BMD patients present a deletion of the exons 45-48 or 45-49. We present cardiological data – retrospectively evaluated – from 16 Becker patients, aged from 7 to 52 years, sharing a deletion involving exon 48 alone. The mean age of the follow-up was 6,6 years (range 1-13,9). Cardiac function was evaluated, at 6-month intervals, by standard and dynamic Ecg, Mono and 2Dechocardiography, echocolor-doppler-cardiography. The following cardiologic parameters were considered: Heart Rate, PQ interval, PQ segment, QT interval, Cardiomyopathic Index, T wave anomalies, presence of ectopic ventricular beats, ventricle diameters, left ventricular free wall and septum thickness, ejection fraction, fiber shortening, integrated back scattering. Data collected at the last control, compared with those at the time of the first control, show that no sign or symptom of cardiomyopathy is evident in these patients, suggesting that BMD patients sharing deletions limited to exon 48, seem to escape dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy for a long time. The possible causes of such a condition are discussed.
