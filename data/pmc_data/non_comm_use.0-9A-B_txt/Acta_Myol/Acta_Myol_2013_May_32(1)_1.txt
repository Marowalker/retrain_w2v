==== Body
France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Turkey, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Albany, Macedonia, Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Italy: these are the 22 Mediterranean Countries that were invited to participate in a meeting in Ischia, Naples on 4th October 1993.

At that time the knowledge about muscular diseases was very poor, the word "Myology" almost unknown and, as a consequence, the international Societies of Myology not yet founded.

The participants at the Ischia meeting decided to create a "Mediterranean Society of Myology". The permanent venue was established in Naples, while the Secretary Antony Galea Debono was asked to write the statute (see below) that was lodged in Malta. The subsequent MSM Congresses were successful thanks the participation not only of representatives of the countries of the Mediterranean area but also from other parts of the world. Germany – on behalf of his representative Reinhardt Rüdel - asked to be part of the Society explaining that the Danube river, which bathes Ulm, his city, flows into the Black Sea, which, in turn, through the Dardanelles Narrows, flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

I was proud for such a success and I was very happy when Luciano Merlini – Professor in Bologna - invited me in March 1995 to join him and Victor Dubowitz who intended to create a "World Muscle Society" following the rules established for the Mediterranean Society of Myology.

Thanks to the help of George Serratrice from Marseille, Lefkos Middleton from Nicosia, Reinhardt Rudel from Ulm and the local high level collaboration of Lucia Comi and Luisa Politano, all the MSM Congresses from 1995 to 2011 (see table) met a great success of participation.

Let me stress the memories of two great Congresses, the 5th held in Capri (Italy) in September 2000 and the 7th held in Ephesus (Turkey) in May 2004. However all the ten MSM Congresses have been characterised by important features: 1. Love, not only for the science but also for the patients; 2. Friendship among all participants even coming from countries not friends with each other; 3. Gaetano Conte Awards, given at each Congress to scientists coming from different Countries in the world, who were leaders in basic, clinical or social Myology.

Mediterranean Society of Myology has reached many of its objectives and I am sure that also the XI Congress, organised in Athens by Marinos Dalakas in October 2013, will have the same high quality profile.

I hope that – despite the financial problems, more serious in the Mediterranean area – many myologists, not only from the Mediterranean Countries but also from other parts of Europe, Americas, Japan and Australia will join us once again. I'm sure we will again have success, because it is true, we have financial problems, but we also have ideas and ........love. We are Mediterraneans.
