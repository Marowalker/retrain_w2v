Mitochondrial disorders (MDs) are caused by impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The ETC is needed for oxidative phosphorylation, which provides the cell with the most efficient energy outcome in terms of ATP production. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of MDs is the generation of reactive oxygen species. 

Potential pharmacological approaches for MDs include ETC cofactors (i.e., Coenzyme Q10) and other metabolites (i.e., carnitine), antioxidants, neuroprotective drugs (i.e., tetracyclines), bezafibrate (an activator of PGC-1alpha). Controlled trials in large cohorts of patients are still needed, because therapy for mitochondrial diseases remains inadequate and mostly symptomatic. It will be important to develop a better understanding of the role of oxidative stress, since it may lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies.
