For details, please refer to http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/In this brief review, I have highlighted recent advances in several areas
of mitochondrial medicine, including mtDNA-related diseases,
mendelian mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, and therapy. The
pathogenic mechanisms of mtDNA mutations, especially those affecting
mitochondrial protein synthesis, are still largely unknown.
The pathogenicity of homoplasmic mtDNA mutations has become
evident but has also called attention to modifying nuclear genes,
yet another example of impaired intergenomic signaling. The functional
significance of the homoplasmic changes associated with mitochondrial
haplogroups has been confirmed. Among the mendelian
disorders, a new form of “indirect hit” has been described, in
which the ultimate pathogenesis is toxic damage to the respiratory
chain. Three therapeutic strategies look promising: (i) allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in MNGIE (mitochondrial
neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy); (ii) bezafibrate, an activator
of PGC-1α, has proven effective in animal models of mitochondrial
myopathy; and (iii) pronucleus transfer into a normal
oocyte is effective in eliminating maternal transmission of mtDNA,
thus preventing the appearance of mtDNA-related disorders.

==== Body
This paper – as the lecture from which it derives –
are dedicated to the memory of Eduardo Bonilla (Fig. 1),
a great myologist and a great friend.

Although mitochondria have multiple functions, it
is fair to say that the most important is the generation
of energy. In Figure 2, an oversimplified schematic view
of mitochondrial metabolism, I have highlighted the respiratory
chain, the “business end” of oxidative metabolism,
where ATP is actually produced. One “green view”
of mitochondria is that they approximate ecologically
friendly hydrogen engines: the breakfast that you ate this
morning (derived from sunlight) is metabolized through
pathways residing mostly outside (glycolysis) or inside
(β-oxidation) the mitochondria. Electrons generated in
the Krebs cycle from the oxidation of acetyl-CoA are carried along the four multimeric components of the electron
transport chain (complexes I-IV) embedded in the inner
mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and protons are pumped
from the inside of the IMM (mitochondrial matrix) to the
intermembrane space (IMS) between the IMM and the
outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). The resulting
chemosmotic potential is used to operate the tiniest rotary
machine, ATP synthase (complex V), where the influx of
protons back into the matrix makes the rotor (F0) turns
on the stator (F1) at the respectable speed of 1,000 RPM,
bringing together ADP and Pi and releasing ATP (1, 2).

A recent remarkable achievement in our understanding
of energy production by the respiratory chain has
been the clarification of the α-helical structure of the
membrane domain of complex I of E. coli by Leonid
Sazanov’s group (3). The transfer of 2 electrons from
NADH to quinone is coupled to the transfer of 4 protons
across the IMM, and two mechanisms of coupling
had been proposed, a direct, redox-driven mechanism
or an indirect, conformation-driven mechanism. When
the electrons reach the quinone moiety, conformational
changes in complex I subunits (called NuoA/J/K/H) push
a long α-helix towards other transmembrane subunits
(NuoL/M/N) in a piston-like action [as aptly described by Tomoko Onishi in a News & Views article (4)] thus opening
up “trapdoors” through which protons can pass.

Let me consider first recent progress in our understanding
of pathogenesis, which unfortunately is still largely
“terra incognita” both for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-
and for nuclear DNA (nDNA)-related disorders.

Disorders due to mutations
in mtDNA
For what concerns mtDNA-related diseases, heteroplasmy
and the threshold effect still are the best criteria
to explain phenotypic variability. The best example is the NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa)
syndrome, first described by Anita Harding in 1990 in
four maternally related relatives: three adults with sensory
neuropathy, ataxia, exercise intolerance, retinitis
pigmentosa, and dementia; and one child with developmental
delay, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and abnormal
EEG (5). The relationship between m.8993T > G
mutation load and clinical severity was documented by
Tatuch et al., who showed that about 70% heteroplasmy
in skeletal muscle resulted in an adult-onset syndrome
corresponding to the acronymic features of NARP
whereas higher degrees of heteroplasmy (around 90%)
were accompanied by Leigh syndrome (LS) in infants
or children (6).

One would expect that mutations in different mitochondrial
tRNA genes, affecting – as they all do – mitochondrial
protein synthesis in toto, should cause a “swamp”
of largely overlapping symptoms and signs. Contrarywise,
clinical experience shows that mutations in individual
tRNA genes are often, though not always, associated with
specific syndromes. Thus, most patients with MELAS harbor
the m.3243A > G mutation in tRNALeu(UUR) whereas
most patients with MERRF harbor the m.8344A > G mutation
in tRNALys. In addition, single deletions in mtDNA,
which also impair mitochondrial protein synthesis globally,
almost invariably cause one of three syndromes, the generalized
Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), the muscle-specific
chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), or
the hematopoietic Pearson syndrome (PS) (7). At this time,
the best explanation for this puzzling phenomenon is a spatial
selectivity in the distribution of individual mutations, at
least in the brain. This concept has been supported by immunohistochemical
and in situ hybridization studies showing,
for example, a predilection of the MELAS mutation
for subpial arterioles (8, 9), of the MERRF mutation for
the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (10), and of single
mtDNA deletions for the choroid plexus (11). The obvious
but unanswered next question is what “directs” each mutation
to a selected area.

The next area of exciting recent development regards
homoplasmy. Although the first documented pathogenic
point mutation in mtDNA (m.11778G > A in the ND4
gene) was, in fact, homoplasmic and associated with Leber
hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (12), we have long
ignored this lesson, to the point of including heteroplasmy
among the canonical criteria of pathogenicity. And this in
the face of increasing evidence that homoplasmic mutations
were often associated with tissue-selective disorders such
as LHON (13), deafness (14), deafness/cardiopathy (15),
or tissue-specific disorders such as cardiomyopathy (16).

The evolving concept of homoplasmy has resonated
with me personally because it has solved a conundrum
that has been a thorn in my side for the past 26 years. In 1983, together with my colleagues at Columbia University
Medical Center, I reported the puzzling case of
an infant who was profoundly floppy at birth and whose
initial muscle biopsy showed virtually no staining for
cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (17). With vigorous supportive
therapy and despite our gloomy expectations, the
child improved spontaneously and rather rapidly: his severe
lactic acidosis declined, his strength increased, and
his muscle biopsy at 7 months of age showed that about
50% of all fibers were now COX-positive. By 3 years
of age, the child was neurologically normal and a third
muscle biopsy showed, if anything, some excess COX
stain. Unfortunately at the time we did not pay enough
attention to Eduardo Bonilla’s astute observation that the
mother’s muscle biopsy (but not the father’s) showed a
few scattered COX-negative fibers. However, it did not
escape Rita Horvath’s attention that all 17 patients from
12 unrelated families with virtually identical reversible
COX-deficient myopathy harbored a homoplasmic “polymorphism,”
m.14674T > C in the tRNAGlu gene of mtDNA
(18). This obviously pathogenic change cannot, in
and by itself, explain the muscle-specificity of the disease
or its reversibility, nor can it explain why some but not all
maternal relatives are affected (18).

Pathogenic homoplasmic mtDNA mutations highlight
yet another important aspect of the dependence of
the mitochondrial on the nuclear genome. If it is true that
from the beginning of mitochondrial genetics there has
been a lot of handwaving about nuclear factors modulating
the phenotypic expression of mtDNA mutations, now
this has become a present and immediate question demanding
that we identify the putative “nuclear modifiers”
and understand their mechanism of action.

In the long course of their migration out of Africa,
which started about 150,000 year ago, our ancestors accumulated
harmless mtDNA changes (polymorphisms) that
differed among different populations and still define ethnic
groups (19). It was proposed that these ancient variations
are not only harmless but, in fact, adaptive, thus
facilitating the settlement of different groups in favorable
ecological niches (20). Thus, for example, a mtDNA
variation conducive to loose coupling of oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) would enhance the dissipation of
energy as heat and be advantageous to people living in
frigid climates. Although their effect on OXPHOS would
be small, haplogroup-defining mutations might behave
as susceptibility factors in multifactorial diseases, in the
context of particular environmental or nuclear factors.
Such small effect on OXPHOS has been documented by
“homogenizing” environmental and nuclear backgrounds
with the use of cybrid cell lines, that is, immortalized human
cell lines emptied of their own mtDNA and repopulated
with haplotype-specific mitochondria (19).

Mendelian mitochondrial disorders
With the term “indirect hits” we refer to mutations in
nuclear genes that do not affect respiratory chain subunits
directly, but alter proteins needed for the assembly and
maintenance of respiratory chain complexes. Numerous
such indirect hits have been associated with defects in all
five complexes of the respiratory chain (21), but Valeria Tiranti
and Massimo Zeviani in Milan, Italy, have discovered
a novel type of indirect hit, where the second whammy is
toxic instead of structural. First, using integrative genomics,
they found that ethylmalonic encephalomyopathy (EE),
a devastating early-onset disorder with encephalopathy,
microangiopathy, chronic diarrhea, and massively increased
levels of ethylmalonic acid and short-chain acylcarnitines in
body fluids, was due to mutations in the ETHE1 gene (22).
They then documented that ETHE1 is a mitochondrial
matrix thioesterase (23) and created an Ethe1-null mouse,
which led them to discover that thiosulfate and sulfide accumulate
excessively both in the animal model and in affected
children due to the lack of sulfur dioxygenase activity (24).
As sulfide is a powerful COX inhibitor, what they described
was an indirect hit of a toxic kind and likely the prototype
of other similar pathogenic mechanisms.

Yet another indirect mechanism involving sulfur metabolism
(the mitochondrial disulfide relay system, DRS)
and resulting in multiple respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies
(complexes I, II, and IV) was discovered by the group
of Giacomo Comi, also in Milan (25). The patients were
three siblings born of consanguineous parents. They all had
congenital cataracts and various degrees of psychomotor
delay, hypotonia, hearing loss, bilateral or unilateral ptosis,
sensorineural hearing loss, and lactic acidosis. At age 17
years, the older sibling needed tutorial assistance at school
and was hyporeflexic. His brain MRI only showed thinning
of the corpus callosum. Muscle histochemistry showed
scattered COX-negative, SDH-hyperintense fibers and ultrastructural
studies revealed vacuolated mitochondria with
thickened cristae. Biochemical analysis showed partial decrease
of COX (30%-50% residual activity) and less severe
reduction of complexes I and II. Homozygosity mapping
led to the identification of a missense mutation in the gene
(GFER) whose product belongs to the ERV1/ALR protein
family. Yeast Erv1p (and presumably its human counterpart
GFER, a sulfhydryl oxidase) oxidizes the disulfide carrier
protein Mia40, which, in turn, transfers a disulfide to
newly synthesized proteins in the mitochondrial IMS. The
reoxidaton of Erv1p is mediated by cytochrome c and COX,
thus linking the DRS to the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
Comi and coworkers showed that the mutant GFER is unstable
and its concentration decreases in mitochondria, thus
probably inhibiting the import of DRS substrates, including
COX17, TIMM13, and COX6B1 (25). It is noteworthy that a mutation in COX6B1 has been the first example of a “direct
hit” in complex IV deficiency (26). It is also noteworthy
that defects of the DRS are yet another cause of multiple
mtDNA deletions, which were documented in muscle from
one of the patients with mutant GFER (25).

As I mentioned in a recent historical review (21) for
now at least, the last frontier of research in mitochondrial
disorders seems to be the defects of mitochondrial translation.
Within the past four years, often through homozygosity
mapping, defects have been discovered in genes controlling
factors at all levels of the complex translation apparatus, from
rRNA base modification, such as MRPS16 (27) to general
translation, such as EFG1 (now called GFM1) (28-31) to
tRNA processing and base modification, such as PUS1 (32)
to tRNA synthetase (33, 34). This subject has been recently
and lucidly reviewed by Smits et al. (35).

Therapy
This is very much an area of work in progress, but there
are three developments that are worth discussing briefly:
stem cell therapy in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal
encephalomyopathy (MNGIE); boosting mitochondrial
biogenesis as a therapeutic strategy; and pronuclear transfer
as a preventive measure to mtDNA-related disorders.

MNGIE is an autosomal recessive multisystemic disease
characterized clinically by progressive external ophthalmoplegia
(PEO), ptosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility,
extreme cachexia, peripheral neuropathy, leukoencephalopathy,
and death in early or mid-adulthood (36). The disease
is due to loss-of-function mutations in the TYMP gene
that encodes the cytosolic enzyme thymidine phosphorylase
(TPase) (37). As a result, there is a dramatic elevation
of thymidine and deoxyuridine in blood and tissues (38)
and severe deoxynucleotide pool imbalance, which causes
multiple mtDNA deletions, depletion, and site-specific
point mutations (39). One obvious therapeutic approach
is to eliminate the toxic metabolites through hemodialysis,
but single treatments had only transient effect in two patients
(40) whereas chronic dialysis for over a year failed to
slow disease progression in one patient (41). Nor did prolonged
peritoneal dialysis fare any better (42). Attempts to
replace the missing TPase using erythrocyte-encapsulated
TPase or platelet infusion did improve symptoms but paradoxically
did not lower plasma nucleotide levels (42).

Michio Hirano took a more radical approach to enzyme
replacement therapy by employing allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which
proved very effective in a first patient (43, 44) and has
been successful to date in five of the 11 patients so treated
(45). An international therapeutic trial is underway and
will hopefully confirm that this approach, though risky,
can be a lifesaver in MNGIE.

In recent years, increasing attention has been directed
to mitochondrial biogenesis and, more specifically, to the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α
protein (PGC-1α for short), a transcriptional coactivator
that binds to several transcription factors and induces gene
expression (46). Importantly, PGC-1α is a strong promoter
of mitochondrial biogenesis and function (47). This property
has been exploited by French clinical scientists, who
used bezafibrate (a PGC-1α activator), an approved drug
in Europe, to treat patients with imborn errors of fatty acid
oxidation (48, 49) and respiratory chain defects (50).

In a series of elegant papers, Tina Wenz and Carlos
Moraes in Miami illustrated both the pathogenic role of
PGC-1α and its potential therapeutic usefulness. Particularly
relevant to the therapy of human mitochondrial myopathies,
they used a knock-in mouse model of mitochondrial
myopathy with partial COX deficiency due to a mutation in
the assembly gene COX10. Promoting mitochondrial biogenesis
either by transgenic expression of PG1-α or by administration
of bezafibrate resulted in improved respiratory
chain function and ATP production, delayed appearance of
the myopathy, and prolonged lifespan (51, 52).

There is a form of gene therapy for mtDNA-related
diseases that is ready for experimentation in humans but is
stalled by ethical concerns. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations,
especially those affecting tRNA genes can be eliminated
literally ab ovo by transferring an in vitro-fertilized nucleus
from the ooplasm of a woman carrying the mutation to an
enucleated oocyte from a normal donor. The resulting embryo,
containing normal nuclei from mother and father and
normal mitochondrial genomes from the donor woman,
can be implanted in the mother’s uterus. The feasibility
of cytoplasmic transfer has now been documented by the
Newcastle group in the UK (53) and a variant of this approach
has been used in the US to produce two healthy
“transmitochondrial” rhesus monkeys carrying undetectable
mtDNA from their biological mother (54).

I hope that this brief update on the pathogenesis and
therapy of mitochondrial diseases conveys the fervor of
research in mitochondrial medicine and the exciting realization
that effective therapy is finally within our grasp for
at least some of these devastating disorders.
