==== Body
The objective to identify appropriate outcome measures to use in clinical trials or observational studies. Natural history data of patients with the heterogeneous juvenile/adult form of glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) are useful to evaluate enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).

We evaluated several outcome measures before and during ERT, such as a series of timed and graded functional tests i.e. Gait, Stairs, Gowers, Chair (GSGC) score, the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Forced Vital Capacity.

During an observational study we monitored a series of 32 patients using these outcome measures at 1 year after ERT and observed a partial but significant improvement. A significant decrease was observed in Gait time and time to raise from the chair and total GSGC score. A gain of function was observed in few cases.

Important, crucial topics seem to be: the use of different functional parameters in determining the efficacy of ERT, since not all juvenile/adult patients respond similarly, and, reliable outcomes of treatment.
