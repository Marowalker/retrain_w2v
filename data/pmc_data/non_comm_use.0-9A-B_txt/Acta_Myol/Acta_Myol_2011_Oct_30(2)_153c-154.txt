==== Body
The most common autoimmune inflammatory myopathies include Polymyositis (PM), Dermatomyositis (DM), Necrotizing Autoimmune Myositis (NAM) and Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). Polymyositis still remains an uncommon but frequently misdiagnosed disorder. NAM, IBM, and inflammatory dystrophies are the myopathies most often misdiagnosed as PM. The presence of MHC-1/CD8 complex remains the most useful immunopathologic marker because it reliably distinguishes, most of the times, the antigen-driven inflammatory cells that characterize PM and IBM from the non-specific, secondary inflammation seen in dystrophies, and from the non-MHC-I, macrophage- mediated process, seen in NAM. In PM and IBM, the co-stimulatory molecules ICOS/ICOS-L and PD-L1 are strongly upregulated, indicating an immunological synapse formation between cytotoxic T cells and muscle fibers. 

In s-IBM, the inflammatory cells invade non-vacuolated fibers while the vacuolated fibers are not invaded by T cells implying two independent processes: a primary immune process with antigen driven T cells identical to PM, and a degenerative process in which β-amyloid and related proteins may participate in vacuolar degeneration. An interrelationship between inflammation and amyloid-related or stressor proteins is the most exciting new observation with potential therapeutic implications.

DM is a complement-mediated microangiopathy affecting skin and muscles; the role of alpha-interferon-related molecules seem to be secondary events. NAM is a histologically distinct myopathy of acute/subacute onset that can be associated with cancer, viral infections, autoimmunity, or statins. Whether certain antibodies play a role by recruiting macrophages to the muscle in an ADCC process, remains unclear.

In uncontrolled studies, PM and DM respond to prednisone to some degree and for some period of time; adding an immunosuppressive drug (Azathioprine, Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate, Methotrexate) may have a steroid-sparing effect but their benefit is uncertain. In contrast, IBM is resistant to most of these therapies, most times. Controlled studies have shown that IVIg is effective and safe for the treatment of DM. The clinical benefit, which can be impressive in patients with early disease, is associated with improvement in the muscle cytoarchitecture and resolution of the aberrant immunopathological parameters, including interception of complement activation and downregulation of ICAM-I, VCAM, TGF-β, MHC-I and various immunoregulatory and structural genes. IVIg seems to be also effective in patients with PM but offers transient help to a small number of patients with IBM.

New agents currently on the market may be promising new therapies for the treatment of inflammatory myopathies. Among them include the monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins against: a) molecules associated with T-cell-signaling pathways, such as the anti-CD52 (CAMPATH), anti-LFA/ICAM (Leukocyte Functional Antigen/ Intracellular Adhesion Molecule), and anti-IL2 receptor (IL2-receptor antagonist). Further, two cytophillin-binding drugs, Tacrolimus and Rapamycin, that prevent the IL2-induced T cell proliferation or transcription, may be candidate agents for certain conditions; b) B cells using the monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, expressed on B cells (Rituximab) or the humanized version Occrelizumab; agents against B-cell growth factors, such as BAFF and APRIL are in the offing; c) Complement C5 (Eculizumab), which might be appropriate for some complement-mediated disorders like DM or NAM; d) cytokines, especially agents against TNF-α, IL1 or IL1β; and e) Cellular Adhesion and T cell transmigration molecules. Such agents include Natalizumab directed against a4β1 integrin (VLA4) on lymphocytes, a drug approved for multiple sclerosis, and Fingolimod, an anti-T-cell-migration agent that traps lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs.
