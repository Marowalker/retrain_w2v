==== Body
To report two sisters with a metabolic myopathy due to muscle carnitine deficiency. 

The younger sister was a 22 year-old extremely thin and weak girl, that since two years presented progressive upper and lower girdle, neck and trunk weakness, myalgias, exercise intolerance, episodes of hypoglycemia (31 mg/ dl), vomiting, loss of body weight (10 kg), high CK levels (15.000 U/L); she was fed by nasogastric tube and became virtually quadriplegic. CK levels decreased to 302 U/L, whereas aldolase (21.8 U/L) and gamma G-T were elevated. Muscle MRI revealed oedema and atrophy of upper girdle muscles. A psychiatric examination excluded nervous anorexia. The older sister was 28 year old and since 4 years had a progressive lower limb weakness. She received a previous diagnosis of polymyositis, though she did not respond to IVIg, methotrexate or steroids. Muscle biopsy was investigated by appropriate morphological and biochemical investigations. Acyl-carnitines were analyzed in serum by radiochemical assay and their profile was investigated by mass spectroscopy; no organic acidemia was found.

In both sisters muscle biopsy showed a lipid storage myopathy (LSM). In the younger sister total carnitine deficiency was found both in plasma (15% of control mean) and in muscle (30% of control). Free carnitine was also reduced in plasma 3.34 nMol/ml (normal 27.6-61.9). Long chain acyl-carnitines levels were normal in both muscle and plasma. In the older sister total muscle carnitine levels were reduced (12% of control mean). Oral carnitine and riboflavin supplementation in the younger sister restored muscle strength, the body weight was increased and nasogastric tube was removed.

We show the value of accurate biochemical studies in severe muscle weakness of unexplained origin associated with LSM. Although in muscle carnitine deficiency the hallmark is low carnitine levels with normal acyl-carnitines, in the younger sister a low plasma carnitine was also found. The clinical phenotype suggests a muscle carnitine deficiency but biochemical studies are compatible with a systemic inherited carnitine defect.
