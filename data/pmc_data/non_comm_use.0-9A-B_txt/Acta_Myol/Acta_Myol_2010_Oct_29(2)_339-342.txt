==== Body
Introduction
Glycogenoses are a group of diseases characterized
by an impairment in energy production in skeletal muscles.
They include defects in glycogen synthesis, glycogen
breakdown or glycolysis (Table 1). Clinically, they
range from multisystemic and rapidly fatal diseases, to
isolated slowly progressive myopathies (e.g. glycogenosis
type II), or to episodic muscle dysfunction during exercise
(e.g. McArdle’s disease). A rapid diagnosis is now
increasingly important to give patients the chance of the
new treatments becoming available in the last years.

Glycogenosis type II
Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) is an autosomal
recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of
the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA) or acid
maltase, which catalyses the hydrolysis of α-1,4 and
α-1,6 linkages of glycogen. The enzyme deficiency leads
to lysosomal accumulation of glycogen that results in different
clinical phenotypes (severe or infantile, juvenile
and adult onset).

The severe infantile form of GSDII (Pompe disease)
is characterized by marked hypotonia and cardiomyopathy
usually due to complete GAA deficiency, and patients die within the first year of life, if untreated, for cardiorespiratory
failure (1).

The juvenile and adult forms, named late-onset GSDII,
are slowly progressive myopathies mimicking limbgirdle
dystrophy, frequently characterized by an early
respiratory involvement with diaphragmatic paralysis and
restrictive respiratory insufficiency (2); a residual enzyme
activity is usually found (3).

The histopathological hallmark is muscle fiber vacuolization
and autophagy. The vacuoles can vary for size
and shape, show PAS-positivity and strong reaction for
lysosomal acid phosphatase. In the infantile form, the
muscle fiber structure is severely compromised, while the
degree of vacuolization is extremely variable in late-onset
patients, and appeared sometimes to be independent of
age of onset, disease duration or clinical features (3).

Genotype-phenotype correlations showed that although
the nature of the mutation sometimes matches the
phenotype, in most cases the disease phenotype is hard
to predict on the basis of gene mutations alone. Furthermore,
the age at onset and the disease course may be
quite different in patients with identical genotypes (e.g.
siblings), suggesting a modulating role of both the genetic
background and of exogenous factors on GAA gene
expression, which might produce a shift in the enzyme
biosynthesis rate (3).

Knowledge of the natural history of the late-onset
disease is still poorly investigated, mostly because of its
extremely heterogeneous course.

Trials with replacement therapies
Several replacement therapies have been tried in
GSDII patients since 1967, when an enzyme derived
from Aspergillus niger was unsuccessfully tested (4).
Decades ago it was recognized that various cell types
need specific receptors for uptake of exogenous lysosomal
enzymes. In muscle and liver it was the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6P). This gave new chance to
the research.

In the meantime, other therapeutical options have
been tried. A dietary treatment with high-protein and lowcarbohydrates,
with supplementation with L-alanine, and
associated with physical aerobic sub-maximal exercise (5)
was proposed. The purpose of the dietary treatment was
to decrease the deposition of glycogen in lysosomes, and
to antagonize the protein catabolism in muscles observed
in GSDII patients’ tissues, and stimulating fatty-acid utilization
in muscles as an energy source during aerobic
exercise. The theoretic substrate of this therapy is confirmed
by the case of a 26-year old patient, followed at
our center, who presented acute respiratory failure after
2 months of vegetarian diet, resolved after ventilatory
therapy and hyperproteic diet. The clinical outcome in
Slonim’s study was surprisingly good, even if the compliance
to the scheme was not easy, and the increase of body
weight of some patients worsened their motor function.

In 2000 Genzyme-Pharming announced the discontinued
development of enzyme replacement therapy with
recombinant human enzyme from rabbit milk, then Genzyme
believed the production in CHO cells to be quicker
and more efficient.

Recombinant enzyme replacement
In infantile Pompe disease an enzyme replacement
treatment with recombinant alpha-glucosidase (rGAA)
has been tried both in the US and Europe (1, 6), with major
benefits on survival and cardiomyopathy.

Only relatively few treated late-onset patients in Europe
have been so far extensively reported (7-9). This fact
demonstrates that it is difficult to compare the action of
ERT in late-onset cases, because of the heterogeneous
clinical features and the slow progression of the disease in
those patients. Since ERT treatment has been approved in
Europe, a blind trial would not be accepted by patients and
therefore it is now impossible to carry it out. Otherwise,
it is important to investigate in a multidisciplinary and
quantitative way the treated GSDII patients, to describe
the natural course of the disease, to underline the benefits
of ERT and to identify the non-responder patients. We are
conducting a multicenter observational study in 18 centers
in Italy that has so far collected 78 treated cases including
walking and non-walking patients (Table 2).

It is clear that ERT is a safe therapy: only mild infusion-
related adverse reactions have been observed (Table
2). It is clear that ERT is effective in infantile form, especially
on reducing the cardiomegaly and prolong the
survival. Otherwise it is not easy to demonstrate the real
efficacy of the therapy in late-onset GSDII, on the slowly
progressive motor and respiratory failure, and the long term efficacy. A randomized double-blind study has been
done in 60 walking patients proving an efficacy, although
of modest degree, in 6-minute-walk-test and stabilization
of respiratory function (10).

The most important limits of the enzymatic therapy
are the difficulty to reach the target, in muscles fibers
were the M6P receptors density is much lower than in the
heart, and the formation of antibodies that may reduce
the efficacy of the protein and the presence of structural
alteration of muscle with build up of connective tissue.
The first one can be overcome by the conjugation of the
recombinant enzyme with a synthetic oligosaccharide
containing M6P (11), resulting in an improved affinity for
the M6P receptor and delivery to muscle cells. The use of
chaperones is still experimental and their use in two US
patients has led to more pronounced weakness.

Glycogenosis type V – McArdle
Disease
McArdle disease is a metabolic myopathy caused
by the genetic deficiency of the glycolytic enzyme myophosphorylase.
It is clinically characterized by exercise
intolerance, fatigue and exercise induced myalgia, and,
in some cases, by myoglobinuria resulting in acute renal
failure due to rhabdomyolysis. A small proportion of patients
develop a progressive weakness of proximal muscles,
especially of upper limbs.

The enzymatic defect causes a global impairment
in muscle metabolism. The impossibility to mobilise
glycogen subsarcolemmal deposits during anaerobic
metabolism, the reduction of pyruvate production in
the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the subsequent oxidative
phosphorylation impairment bring to a reduction of
Acetyl-CoA production, with a cyclic worsening of function
of tricarboxylic acid cycle.

The breakdown of fatty acid can, in some trained
patients, generate some alternative quantities of Acetyl-
CoA; the shift to fatty acid oxidation is the basis of the
“second wind” phenomenon, the possibility of patients to
continue the exercise after some minutes of rest, when the
pain occurs.

Many drugs or dietary treatments have been tried
to reduce symptoms in this rare disease, but all of them
failed to demonstrate a significant amelioration in these
patients. It is important to underline that every study was
designed with a small number of patients, furthermore
the clinical heterogeneity prevented the establishment of
measurable primary outcomes.

Aminoacids, high protein diet, and fatty acid supplementation
have been tried to improve alternative energy
sources instead of glycolytic metabolism (12), but only in
single anecdotic cases a success has been claimed.
