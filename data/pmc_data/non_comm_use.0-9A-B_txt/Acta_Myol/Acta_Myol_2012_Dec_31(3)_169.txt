==== Body
The 31st year of Acta Myologica bears witness to the long and fruitful German-Italian collaboration, by publishing nine articles from scientists of the most prestigious Universities of Germany. The cooperation was stimulated by Reinhardt Rüdel who has spent much of his time in order to assure the success of this initiative. Reinhardt Rüdel deserves our personal gratitude for the excellent organizational work and the continuous support.

The three issues of Acta Myologica have hosted several articles on symptomatic treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a special emphasis on the steroid treatment of DMD showing the good results achieved in all the aspects (skeletal muscles, respiratory muscles and heart) of the disease. Such a treatment – combined with a better management of the respiratory and cardiological complications – is able to double the life expectancy of DMD patients and to improve their survival till the third-fourth decade. To be mentioned furthermore the articles on the genetic counseling approach and on the emerging pathogenic and therapeutic possibilities.

The recently starting section "Memories of a Myologist" published contributions by Yves Rideau from Poitiers, who told his long-life experience with DMD patients and their families, and Anica Jušić from Zagreb.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank our Co-Editors and Editorial Board for their constant support and the Publishing Editor, doctor Pacini and his staff who have always come to meet our needs. We are also grateful to the many reviewers who have contributed to maintain the standard of the Journal with their expertise. Their names are listed in this issue. If any readers are interested in reviewing papers in their area of expertise, they are welcome to contact the Editor with their background details.

The Mediterranean Society of Myology (MSM), funded in 1993 and the Italian Association of Myology (AIM) adopted Acta Myologica as their official journal. Next year we shall have the 13th AIM Meeting in the beautiful city of Stresa, Lake Maggiore in May (16-18) organised by Lucia Morandi (Milan) and the 11th MSM Congress in Athens, in November, organised by Marinos Dalakas.

Looking forward to a very successful 2013 year for both the Journal and the entire Neuro-Myology's Community.

Giovanni Nigro and Luisa Politano
