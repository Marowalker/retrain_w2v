Central core disease (CCD) and malignant hyperthermia (MH) have been linked to point mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor), which is localized on human chromosome 19 (RYR11). Central core disease is a relatively mild, slowly progressive autosomal dominant myopathy, characterized histologically by the presence of centrally located cores running the length of the muscle fibres. MH is a pharmacogenetic induced hypermetabolic disease. CCD linked RyR1 mutations are associated with depletion of thapsigarin-sensitive stores and to an increase of the resting calcium level. Influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular environment is a major factor influencing the level of the resting intracellular [Ca2+]. Our working hypothesis is that decrease of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ load via leaky ryanodine receptor channels and/or alteration of calcium influx via store operated channels or excitationcoupled Ca2+ entry (ECCE), may account for, at least in part, the phenotype of patients with CCD, including muscle weakness and abnormal secretion of inflammatory cytokines from muscle cells. We set out to test the validity of our hypothesis by directly investigating the mechanisms activating calcium influx in myotubes from normal individuals and from patients with CCD and MH by TIRF microscopy. Our data shows that some mutations in RYR1 affect ECCE in human myotubes from CCD and MH patients; this enhanced Ca2+ entry is accompanied by the generation of reactive nitrogen species and enhanced nuclear localization of NFATc1, which in turn may be responsible for the increased IL-6 released by myotubes from patients with central core disease.
