When fiftyâ€“five years ago I met for the first time a patient affected by a muscle disease, I was unable to make a diagnosis. This was the main cause to convince me to take part in a meeting on muscular diseases, organised in Trieste by a group of people affected by this kind of disorders or interested in studying them, headed by the unforgettable and untiring Federico Milcovich.

I could never imagine how large could be the field that I was approaching, but from the first moment, muscle diseases came into my life as the most important subject.

Each day, more and more, new social, medical and scientific aspects have emerged, and every day I have seen new progress and encountered new obstacles.

It 's impossible to summarize all the events I attended, the people I met and the institutions that I visited. I can only mention the names of the Associations more familiar to me, having the opportunity to contribute to their birth, such as the Mediterranean Society of Myology, founded in Ischia, Naples in 1993, the World Muscle Society, founded together with Victor Dubowitz and Luciano Merlini in Bologna in 1995, the European Neuromuscular Center founded in Baarn (Netherlands) in 1999, the Italian Association of Myology in Bologna in 2000, or to their growth as it happened for the Unione Italiana Lotta alla Distrofia Muscolare (UILDM) of which I was National President for seven years and President of its Scientific Committee, and during that period I also brought the Telethon marathon from France to Italy.

Beside scientific Associations, many important scientific journals were founded and new and valuable journals have been added recently, all having Myology as the most important subject.

To Myology I dedicated most of my professional 55 years of life, and now, getting ready to leave the world of Myology, I asked friends of MSM and AIM (and obtained) to realize my dream of holding in Naples the Joint Congress of the two Societies in May 2015, as the last Congress I will chair.
