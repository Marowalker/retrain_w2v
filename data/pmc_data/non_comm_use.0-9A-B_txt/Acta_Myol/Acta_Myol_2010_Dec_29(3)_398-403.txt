muscle damage and an abnormal blood flow after muscle
contraction leading to a state of functional ischemia. Abundant
evidence suggests that endothelial circulating progenitor
cells (EPCs) play an important role in mediating vascular and
muscle repair mechanisms and that the stromal cell-derived
factor (SDF)-1 α chemokine is responsible for both progenitor
cell mobilization from the bone marrow to peripheral blood and
homing to the sites of vascular and tissue injury. Since normal
neovascularization is disrupted in DMD pathogenesis and may
contribute ultimately to heart failure and sudden death, the aim
of the present study is to investigate whether the (SDF)-1 α, and
EPCs surface receptors in terms of CD34, CD133 and kinase domain
receptor (KDR) are involved in DMD pathophysiology. In
the present study, peripheral blood concentrations of circulating
CD34, CD133, and CD34/ CD 133 progenitor cells were measured
by flow cytometry, together with serum levels of (SDF)-1α
and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α.), in 28 DMD patients vs.
20 healthy age and socioeconomic matching controls. Results
showed a significant increase in the number of mononuclear cells
bearing EPC markers, HIF-1α mRNA expression and serum
(SDF)-1 α, indicating that regeneration is an ongoing process in
these patients. However, this regeneration cannot counterbalance
the damage induced by dystrophine mutation.

Introduction
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) represents an X-linked recessive disorder related to mutations in the dystrophin gene which is located on chromosome Xp21.1 (1). It is the most common and severe form of dystrophinopathies, characterized by progressive and disabling muscle weakness affecting approximately 1 in 3000 to 4000 male births (2). The disease is characterized by ongoing degeneration and regeneration of skeletal muscle that leads to replacement of muscle by connective tissue and fat (3). In addition to the profound skeletal muscle lesions, a distinctive cardiomyopathy has been recognized in DMD patients (4, 5). Cardiac lesions, characterized by subepicardial fibrosis, particularly of the posterobasal portion of the left ventricle (LV), occur in later stages of the disease and are apparently progressive (6-8), while severe cardiomyopathy develops in the later stages of the disease in a large percentage of patients (8).

Cardiomyopathy is a cardiocytic disease that could be followed by a vascular disease. Previous studies suggested that endothelium-mediated relaxation was attenuated in both coronary and peripheral vessels in cardiomyopathy patients (9, 10), which means that such patients suffer from endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have identified a population of presumably bone marrow–derived cells, called circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that can be isolated from bone marrow or circulating mononuclear cells (11). These EPCs express a variety of endothelial surface markers including CD34, Cd133 and KDR (12). They can incorporate into sites of neovascularization (13) and home to sites of endothelial denudation (14). Initial clinical studies demonstrated that risk factors for atherosclerosis are associated with reduced levels of circulating EPCs (15) and that the functional integrity of the endothelium correlates with the activities of EPCs (16). The number of circulating progenitor cells is thought to be a marker of vascular function and repair capacity and is known to decreases with age (17, 18).

Stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α plays an important role in neovascularization. (SDF)-1α is an EPC chemokine known to be responsible for both progenitor cell mobilization from the bone marrow to peripheral blood and homing to the sites of vascular and tissue injury (19, 20). Recently, SDF-1α and its receptor were identified as essential in bone marrow retention of hematopoietic stem cells, cardiogenesis, angiogenesis, and recruitment of EPCs into ischemic tissue (21, 22). The production of SDF-1and other angiogenic factors is mediated by HIF-1α, a transcriptional activator that functions as a master regulator of responses to tissue hypoxia/ ischemia (23). HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit and an O2-regulated HIF-1α subunit (24).

Since it was suggested lately that normal neovascularization is disrupted in DMD pathogenesis (25), and it is well known that endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) play an important role in mediating vascular repair mechanisms, we assessed the number of EPCs with surface markers KDR, CD133, and CD34 progenitor cells in DMD patients vs. healthy control subjects. Plasma levels of SDF-1 and HIF-1α were additionally investigated.

Subjects and methods
Subjects were 24 boys diagnosed clinically and at the
molecular level as having DMD (mean of age (8.1 ± 1.9),
versus 20 age and socioeconomic matching healthy boys
(mean of age 8.2 ± 2.2). Patients and controls were chosen
to be free from any infection and receiving no therapeutic
treatment known to increase the oxidative stress. Blood
samples were drawn after their parents' consent.

Methods
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation and flow
cytometry
Mononuclear cells were isolated using a Ficoll density
gradient (Biocoll, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) according
to standard protocols as previously described (26).
For FACS analysis, mononuclear cells were resuspended
in 100 μl of PBS. Immunofluorescence cell staining was
performed in duplicate with the use of the fluorescent
conjugated antibodies CD34– FITC (Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, USA; clone 8G12) and CD133-APC (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, USA; clone AC133). Cell fluorescence
was measured immediately after staining, and
data were analyzed with the help of CellQuest software
(FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).
Units of all measured components are absolute cell
counts obtained after the measurement of 250,000 events
in a lymphocyte gate.

Reverse Transcriptase-polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) Analysis for HIF-1α
Total RNA was extracted from lymphocytes using
QIAGEN RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc, USA). The RNA samples were reverse transcribed using superscript
reverse transcriptase, using QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR
kit (QIAGEN Inc USA, Clini Lab). Primer sequences
were: HIF-1α, forward: 5'- CTGTGATGAGGCTTACCATCAGC-
3'; reverse: 5'-CTCGGCTAGTTAGGGTACACTTC-
3'; β-actin forward: 5'-GTG GGG CGC CCC
AGG CAC CA-3'; and reverse: 5'-CTC CTT AAT GTC
ACG CAC GAT TTC-3'. 5 μl of RT reaction of each
cDNA were processed for PCR. Ten μL from each PCR
reaction product were separated on a 2% agarose gel then
stained with ethidium bromide. The appearance of specific
bands at 283 and 540 bp for HIF-1α and β-actin
respectively were evaluated under ultraviolet light and
photographed. Photoes were scanned and quantification
of each band was carried out using gene tools version 4.
Each quantified data point was related to its individual
β-actin (27).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Plasma levels of SDF-1 were measured using a commercially
available ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's
guidelines (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA).
EDTA plasma probes were centrifuged for 15 min at
10,000 g within 30 min of collection. Probes were aliquoted
and stored at −20°C before analysis. The lower detection
limit of this assay is 18 pg/ml (28).

Statistical analysis
Each experimental condition was performed and expressed
as mean ± SD. Comparisons were made by Student's
t-test (two-tailed for independent samples).

Results
The results are listed in tables and figures. There was
a significant increase in the number of mononuclear cells
bearing EPC markers in DMD patients compared to controls.
CD 34 (75 ± 6.2 vs. 60 ± 4.8), CD133 (86 ± 4.7 vs.
75 ± 5.3), KDR (61 ± 4.5 vs. 45 ± 5.6) (table 1 & figure 1).
Also, cells bearing CD34 CD 133 (44 ± 7.2 vs. 34 ± 4.2),
CD34 KDR (36.1 ± 6.5 vs. 21.5 ± 8.3) and CD 133 KDR
(35.4 ± 5.7 vs. 25.5 ± 3.8) were significantly increased
among DMD patients compared to controls (table 1 &
figure 1). There was a significant increase in SDF-1 serum
level (506.5 ± 75.9 vs. 435 ± 82.6) and HIF-ά mRNA
relative expression (3.3 ± 1.2 vs. 1.8 ± 0.6) among DMD
patients compared to controls.

Discussion
In the present study the number of mononuclear
cells bearing EPC markers and HIF-ά together with serum SDF-1 were significantly increased indicating that
regeneration is an ongoing process in DMD patients.
CD34 has been shown to significantly higher among
DMD patients compared to controls. To our knowledge
circulating CD34 positive cells in blood of DMD patients
has not been previously measured neither in blood of
DMD patients nor in animal models. However it can be
expected that CD34 cells are present in DMD patients
for tissue regeneration, but their capacity for muscle regeneration
is hindered. The latter assumption can be confirmed
by the study of Li et al., 2008 (29), who reported
different proliferative and myogenic abilities of mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) in mdx (mice model for DMD
compared to the normal C57BL/10 mice). mdx-MSCs
exhibited increased heterochromatin, larger vacuoles,
and more lysosomes under electron microscopy compared
to C57BL/10-MSCs. C57BL/10-MSCs formed a
few myotubes, while mdx-MSCs did not. They indicated
that at passage 21, mdx-MSCs but not C57BL/10-MSCs
had gradually lost their proliferative ability. In addition,
there was a significant difference in the expression of
CD34. They suggested that the changes in mouse MSC
behaviour may be influenced by lack of dystrophin protein
in mdx mouse. CD34 is a very interesting stem cell
marker. It is an EPC/hematopoietic population, which
is capable of differentiation into cardiomyocytes in vitro
(30) and into cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells
in vivo (31). Its pattern and level of expression in muscle stem cells change as these cells differentiate into myotubes
(32).

In the present study CD133 level was also significantly
higher among DMD patients compared to controls. This is
in agreement with Marchesi et al (2008) (33), who found
that there was an increase in CD133 cells in the blood of
DMD patients compared with healthy controls and that the
mean levels of CD133 cells in DMD subjects showed a
tendency to decrease with advancing age. It was also suggested
that the high level of CD133 cells in blood of DMD
patients may indicate that these cells probably receive more
specific signals for endothelial differentiation from DMD
tissues such as a variety of inflammatory cytokines (34).
CD133-positive cells fraction are mesennchymal stem cells
(MSCs) with high proliferative potential. When placed in
appropriate conditions, these cells proved their capacity
to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes, chondrocytes,
and neuronal/glial cells (35). Also blood-derived CD133-
positive cells were shown to promote the repair of spinal
cord injury and peripheral nerve defects (36). A subpopulation
of human circulating stem cells expressing the CD133
antigen that can differentiate into endothelial and muscle
cell types were identified (37).

KDR is a cell surface receptor and is also a term given
to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR-2.
In the present study the mononuclear cells bearing KDR
were significantly increased among DMD patients compared
to controls. Data to support this finding are scarce.
However, it has been recently indicated that there is an increased
angiogenesis in the brain of dystrophin-deficient
mdx mouse, and that this was related to increased levels
of VEGF and VEGFR (38). In the present study there
is also a significant increase in CD34 KDR and CD133
KDR mononuclear cells compared to controls. It ought
to be mentioned that EPCs are mobilized from the bone
marrow and contribute to postnatal vasculogenesis and
vascular homeostasis, and that the number and the in vitro
function of circulating EPCs are related to endothelial
function (39). It is believed that EPCs are recruited at high
frequency by the overexpression of SDF-1 (40), which
has been shown to be elevated in the present study.

SDF-1 has been shown to be significantly increased
in blood of DMD patients compared to controls. SDF-1
is known to play a key role in CD34-positive cell trafficking
(41), and to mediate mobilization of haematopiotic
stem cells and progenitor cells from the bone marrow
by chemotaxis (42, 43). SDF-1 is known to be induced
by hypoxia and to exert angiogenic effects (44-46). It
has been demonstrated that SDF-1 is overexpressed in
dystrophic muscle, enhances the extravasation of these
cultured progenitor cells into skeletal muscle after intraarterial
transplantation (47). This provides proof to the
finding of the present study.

HIF-1α in the present study was also significantly
higher among DMD patients compared to controls indicating
that a hypoxic condition predominates in DMD.
Induction of SDF-1 after ischemia is mediated by hypoxia-
inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as a transcription factor and
the central mediator of cellular responses to hypoxic conditions
(48). SDF-1 is readily degraded in normoxic cells
and HIF-2 has been shown to be an important mediator of
adaptive responses after ischemia (49). HIF-1 regulates the
expression of hundreds of genes, including those encoding
angiogenic cytokines such as stromal-derived factor
(SDF)-1 (50-52). HIF-1 also mediates cell-autonomous
responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells (53-55). These
data suggest an activation of HIF-1alpha in the brain of
dystrophic mice (38).

We conclude that hypoxic and/or ischemic conditions
in muscle tissue of DMD patients initiate regenerative
processes, which include secretion of (SDF)-1α
that mobilizes EPC from the bone marrow to peripheral
blood, homing it to the sites of vascular and tissue injury.
However, the regeneration process does not balance
the ongoing degeneration caused by dystrophin gene
mutations in DMD patients. The variability in this balance
may control the severity of phenotypic expression
in DMD patients.
