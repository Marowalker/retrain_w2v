==== Body
Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant (AD) disorder caused by a small expansion of a short polyalanine tract in the poly (A) binding protein nuclear 1 protein (PABPN1). The disease is characterized by the adult-onset of progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness. In this study we illustrate clinical features of 13 patients carrying a poly-A expansion, ranging between 12 and 16 repeats. Despite considerable range of PABPN1 expansion we could not detect a linear correlation with phenotype. Most cases (9/13) were familial whereas the remaining were apparently sporadic and there was a moderate female predominance (8:5). Median age at examination was 57 with a mean age at onset of 44 years. Ptosis and dysphagia were prominent symptoms in all cases. Interesting two patients referred only dysphagia as first symptom for several years before developing ptosis. One patient received gastrostomy tube for feeding. Limb weakness was variable and usually proximal. Presence of psychiatric disturbances was also reported in some patients. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated a myopathic pattern in 8 patients whereas nerve conduction velocity studies were normal in all patients, excluding a concomitant nerve involvement which was elsewhere reported. Muscle biopsy analysis (3 patients) showed abundant rimmed vacuoles consistent with previous reports. Our data add new to the clinical characterization of OPMD.
