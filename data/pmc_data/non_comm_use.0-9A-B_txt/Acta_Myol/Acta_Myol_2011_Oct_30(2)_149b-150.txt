==== Body
A multidisciplinary referral clinic for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with inflammatory myopathy has been in operation at the ANRI in Perth since 1990. Patients are seen jointly by a neurologist, a clinical immunologist and physiotherapist and by a speech pathologist if they have swallowing problems. The diagnosis of myositis is confirmed by muscle biopsy in all cases and screening for muscle-associated and muscle-specific autoantibodies is also performed. Over 250 patients have been seen in the clinic, falling into the following categories: inclusion body myositis (32%), dermatomyositis (32%), overlap syndromes (23%), isolated polymyositis (11%), miscellaneous (2%). Muscle function is monitored by manual muscle testing (MMT) and, in selected cases myometry and isokinetic dynamometry is performed. Patients undergo regular reviews to monitor the response to treatment. This has also allowed observations to be made on the frequency of relapses in patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (1), and the variability in the clinical phenotype and rate of progression of muscle weakness and influence of HLA alleles in inclusion body myositis (2). Two new clinical entities have been identified: statin-associated necrotising myopathy with upregulation of MHC-I (3), and a restricted scapulospinal form of myopathy in patients with scleroderma-myositis overlap (4). New therapies such as anti-B cell (rituximab) and anti-T cell (alemtuzumab) monoclonal antibodies have been trialled in selected cases. Rituximab has been found to be beneficial in two patients with resistant dermatomyositis but not in a third patient with severe subcutaneous calcinosis.

A specialised myositis clinic allows clinicians and other personnel involved to develop expertise in the evaluation and management of this group of disorders and provides opportunities for postgraduate training and research. It also makes it possible to develop standardised assessment and treatment protocols and to collect patient cohorts for clinical trials.
