energy in muscle, especially when physiological energy demand is
increased and exceeds what can be provided through glycolysis.
Not surprisingly, a group of muscle disorders due to defects in this
system usually leads to the development of acute rhabdomyolysis
in conditions such as infection, fasting and prolonged exercise.
This group includes β-oxidation cycle defects and deficiencies of
carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPTII) and very-long-chain
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD). Muscle pathology is usually
not very helpful for the diagnosis but immunohistochemistry
may be useful for screening VLCAD deficiency. Another group
of lipid dysmetablolism is lipid storage myopathy (LSM) that is
pathologically characterized by increased lipid droplets both in
number and size in muscle fibers. So far, causative genes have
been identified in four different LSMs, comprising primary carnitine
deficiency, multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or
glutaric aciduria type II, neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis,
and neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy. Clinically,
the LSM patients show slowly progressive muscle weakness
unlike the former group. Final diagnosis is usually made by specific
biochemical assays with mutation analyses. As some effective
drugs have been widely used and some promising therapies are
under certified, comprehensive understanding of these diseases
from clinical, pathological and molecular aspects would be of
much help for the patients.

==== Body
Introduction
Lipid consists of two types of molecules: fatty acid
and its derivatives including triglycerides (TG), and sterol-
containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Fatty acids
are catabolized through β-oxidation cycle in mitochondrial
matrix and thus ATP is produced. Short- and medium-
chain fatty acids can enter cells and then mitochondria
by diffusion but long-chain fatty acids require fatty acid transporters at the plasma membrane and carnitine
palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system at the mitochondrial
membranes.

Lipid dysmetabolism, involving intracellular TG catabolism,
the transport of long-chain fatty acids and carnitine,
or β-oxidation, often causes different extent of lipid
accumulation in skeletal muscle fibers and in other organs.
Among the disorders of lipid metabolism, primary carnitine
deficiency (PCD), multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase
deficiency (MADD) and neutral lipid storage
disease with ichthyosis (NLSDI) or myopathy (NLSDM)
usually show markedly increased lipid droplets in muscle
fibers which are ordinarily termed lipid storage myopathy
(LSM). On the other hand, lipid storage could be mild or
even absent in the defects of intramitochondrial fatty acid
transport and β-oxidation.

The phenotype of lipid metabolism disorders is heterogeneous
but can generally be divided into two major
categories (1), especially in late onset patients. Constant
or progressive muscle weakness associated with or without
metabolic crisis, is often seen in LSM patients while
recurrent rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections, fasting
or vigorous exercise usually occur in the patients with
disorders affecting intramitochondrial fatty acid transport
and β-oxidation, such as deficiencies of carnitine palmitoyltransferase
II (CPTII), mitochondrial trifunctional
protein (MTP) and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
(VLCAD). However, in infantile onset patients,
the clinical manifestations are somehow similar among
all types of lipid dysmetabolism, including hypotonia,
hypoketotic hypoglycemic encephalopathy, hepatomegaly
and cardiomyopathy.

In this review, we would like to go through CPTII
and VLCAD deficiencies briefly but mainly focus on four
LSMs with known causative genes, PCD, MADD, NLSDI
and NLSDM.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II
deficiency (CPTII deficiency)
CPTII, located at the inner mitochondrial membrane,
is responsible for the transfer of long-chain acyl-CoA
(Fig. 1), thus the defects in CPTII would apparently affect
the access of long-chain acyl-CoA to β-oxidation. CPTII
deficiency caused by the mutations in the CPT2 gene is
the first inherited defect of fatty acid oxidation to be identified
(2). Three clinical subtypes, neonatal, infantile and
mild late-onset forms, have been described but muscular
symptoms including recurrent rhabdomyolysis and muscle
pain after long-term exercise were mainly associated
with the late-onset form (3). Infantile cases usually present
recurrent attacks of acute liver failure with hypoketotic
hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy and sudden death while
neonatal-onset patients demonstrate a more severe phenotype
with dysmorphic features. There is a good correlation
between genotype, metabolic dysfunction and phenotype
as null or truncated mutations often cause absent enzyme
activity and earlier-onset phenotype (2). A common mutation,
p.S113L, has been found in more than 50% of mutant
alleles in mild late-onset patients.

Metabolic profiles in CPTII deficiency patients usually
show increased long-chain acylcarnitines. Creatine
kinase (CK) level is markedly elevated after prolonged
fasting or exercise. Muscle pathology is typically characterized by nonspecific changes without increased
lipid droplets. Therefore, enzymatic assay in leukocyte,
cultured fibroblasts or biopsied muscles may be the most
reliable diagnostic test, as well as the mutation analysis
for CPT2. The treatment for CPTII deficiency is mainly
dependent on restricting the diet and avoiding fasting.
Long-chain fat –restricted diet with medium-chain triglycerides
(MCT) supplementation is recommended (4).
Recently, bezafibrate, a commonly used hypolipidemic
drug, has shown to restore the capacity for normal fatty
acid oxidation in muscle cells from patients with a mild
form of CPTII deficiency (5). Though one open-labeled
pilot study was just reported to improve the oxidation rate
of long-chain fatty acid and the physical activity of the
CPTII patients (6), further clinical trials and prolonged
clinical follow-up are necessary to confirm its efficacy.

Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A
dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD
deficiency)
VLCAD localizes in the inner mitochondrial
membrane and catalyzes the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA
which is just incorporated into mitochondrial matrix by
CPTII. Therefore, VLCAD is immediately downstream
to CPTII in long-chain fatty acyl-CoA oxidation pathway.
Not surprisingly, the clinicopathological manifestations of
VLCAD deficiency in myopathic or adult-onset form are
very similar to CPTII deficiency which typically presents
recurrent rhabdomyolysis triggered by exercise or fasting.
There are also early-onset patients showing mainly
cardiac and hepatic involvement. The mutations in the
ACADVL gene was first identified in 1995 (7) and a clear
genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported (8).

The diagnosis of VLCAD deficiency relies on the
measurement of metabolic profile, showing abnormal
elevation of long-chain acylcarnitines. Muscle pathology
usually reveals only nonspecific findings but sometimes
a variable degree of necrotic and regenerating
changes in muscles fibers reflecting recent episodes of
rhabdomyolysis. Lipid droplets are usually not increased.
In addition, immunohistochemistry has demonstrated as
an effective and useful diagnostic method to detect VLCAD
deficiency (Fig. 2A) (9). The therapeutic strategy is
also similar to CPTII deficiency. However, some reports
showed MCT supplementation did not benefit the patients
and even impaired hepatic lipid metabolism in VLCADknockout
mice (10, 11). And as well as CPTII deficiency,
bezafibrate was also used to treat the cultured fibroblasts
from VLCAD deficiency patient and demonstrated the increases
of both mRNA expression and protein level (12).
Thus, further in vivo studies are needed to prove its benefit
in VLCAD deficiency.

(A) Immunohistochemistry shows negative staining of VLCAD
in the patient with VLCAD deficiency. (B) In PCD, lipid
droplets are markedly increased in both number and size
in muscle fibers, especially type 1 fibers. (C) In MADD,
similar features of increased lipid accumulation are seen
as those in PCD. (D) In NLSDM, except for increased lipid
droplets, rimmed vacuoles are seen in muscle fibers.
Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD)
PCD, caused by impaired function of plasma membrane
sodium-dependent carnitine transporter (OCTN2),
is possibly the second most frequent disorder affecting
fatty acid oxidation following medium chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency with the carrier frequency of
about 1% (13). The function of OCTN2 is to transfer carnitine
across the plasma membrane. As carnitine is essential
for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from the
cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix for following oxidation
(Fig. 1), the defect of OCTN2, leading to urinary
loss of carnitine and the failure of intracellular accumulation,
would culminate in deficient fatty acid oxidation.

PCD is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by
the mutations in SLC22A5 which encodes OCTN2 (14).
The clinical manifestations of PCD are widely variable, ranging from asymptomatic feature, isolated cardiomyopathy
to lethal metabolic decompensation. As mentioned
above, the infantile onset patients with PCD principally
present hypotonia, Reye-like syndrome and cardiomyopathy.
However, the cardiomyopathy may develop solely
or with a milder metabolic presentation during childhood
or even older age (15). Since skeletal muscle uses fatty
acid as a major energy source, muscle weakness can also
be observed in PCD patients. Some patients, who have
been asymptomatic for their whole life, may be identified
because of their affected children or siblings (16, 17).
There is no clear correlation between genotype and either
clinical or biochemical phenotype yet reported, suggesting
that the wide phenotypic variability may be related
to epigenetic or exogenous factors which exacerbate carnitine
deficiency (18). Common blood tests may reveal
increased levels of hepatic enzymes and CK.

As for the diagnosis of PCD, the measurement of free
carnitine and all acylcarnitine species is essential and both
extremely low levels are indicative of PCD. Secondary
carnitine deficiency should be carefully excluded which
may show decreased free carnitine level but elevated specific
species of acylcarnitine. However, as plasma carnitine
level can occasionally be normal in PCD, carnitine
transport study in fibroblasts may also be used to confirm
the diagnosis. On muscle pathology, markedly increased
lipid droplets in both number and size in muscle fibers
are seen, especially in type 1 fibers (Fig. 2B). Ultrastructural
study often shows that lipid droplets are present next
to mitochondria which are usually enlarged but structurally
normal. Moreover, as PCD is caused by the defect
of OCTN2, searching for the mutations in SLC22A5 is
another way to establish the diagnosis of PCD.

PCD patients are well responsive to carnitine supplementation
(100-400 mg/kg per day). Early carnitine therapy
has been believed to prevent the occurrence of cardiomyopathy
and other irreversible organ damage (18). In recent
years, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
α (PPARα) has been proved to cause an up-regulation
of OCTN2, leading to an increase of intracellular carnitine
concentration in animal models (19, 20). Therefore,
PPARα agonists may be potential candidates for treating
PCD patients in addition to carnitine supplementation.

Multiple acyl-coenzyme A
dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD)
MADD, also known as glutaric aciduria type II, is
caused by the defects in electron transfer flavoprotein
(ETF), ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH) (also called ETFubiquinone
oxidoreductase), or an unidentified abnormality
in flavin metabolism or transport. In mitochondria, ETF,
which is located in the matrix, receives electron from several dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid oxidation. Electrons
are then transferred to ETFDH, located in the inner
mitochondrial membrane, and subsequently, are passed to
ubiquinone in the respiratory chain (Fig. 1). ETF, ETFDH,
and most mitochondrial enzymes associated with electron
transfer system are flavoproteins, which contain flavin adenine
dinucleotide prosthetic groups (FAD). Therefore,
defective ETF or ETFDH, disturbing the electron transfer,
would finally result in accumulation of various intramitochondrial
acyl-CoA esters, decrease of intramitochondrial
flavin, and probable mitochondrial dysfunction.

Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
ETFA, ETFB and ETFDH, which encode α– and β–subunits
of ETF and ETFDH, respectively (21), have been identified
in MADD patients. Importantly, ETFDH mutations
were reported to be major causes of riboflavin-responsive
MADD (RR-MADD) (22). About the same time, ETFDH
mutations were also found to cause the myopathic form of
coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency (23). However, the relationships
between riboflavin responsiveness, CoQ10 levels
and ETFDH gene mutations are not well-defined. Intriguingly,
a probable founder mutation, c.250G > A (p.A84T)
in ETFDH, was recently reported in southern Chinese population
with an estimated carrier frequency of about 0.8%
in Taiwanese (24, 25). To date, all 20 reported MADD patients
with ETFDH mutations from southern Chinese population
harbor this mutation (25-27). Compared to Japan
with more than 5 times population of Taiwan, the similar
number of reported MADD patients with ETFDH mutations
indicates that the incidence of MADD may be much
higher than previously estimated and many MADD patients
may actually be underdiagnosed at least in Taiwan.

The clinical phenotype of MADD is quite heterogeneous
and has been classified as neonatal onset forms with or
without congenital anomalies, and mild and/or later onset
form. Patients with neonatal onset forms usually present
with hypotonia, hepatomegaly, nonketotic hypoglycemia,
metabolic acidosis and the patients usually died early in
infancy. Later onset patients manifest proximal myopathy
often with hepatomegaly and episodic metabolic crisis;
these episodes can be lethal (28). Cardiomyopathy has also
been reported in both neonatal and later onset MADD
patients (29). Though no clear genotype-phenotype correlation
for each gene has been described, there seems
a tendency that the mutations in ETFA and ETFB cause
neonatal onset forms while the patients with ETFDH
mutations often present the clinical course as later onset
form (30, 31). However, the disease severity is correlated
to not only the nature of the gene defect but also the cellular
factors that may modulate the enzymatic activity (32).
Mildly to moderately elevated CK levels are often found
in routine biochemical test, especially during the episodes
of metabolic decompensation.

The key to diagnosis is the measurement of urinary
organic acid profiles, plasma carnitine, and acylcarnitines.
Urine organic acid analysis typically shows C5 to
C10 dicarboxylic aciduria and acylglycine derivatives.
Plasma free carnitine level is decreased but sometimes retains
normal in some cases. Blood acylcarnitine analysis
usually displays elevated concentrations of mainly medium-
and long-chain acylcarnitines. In addition, reduced
biochemical activities of other mitochondrial enzymes including
flavin-dependent and respiratory chain enzymes,
have been reported (22, 33, 34) in MADD, though it is
still unknown if this mitochondrial dysfunction is directly
caused by ETFDH mutations or other factors. As the variable
clinical manifestations may not be correlated to the
impression of MADD, increased lipid deposition in muscles
is sometimes the first sign guiding the subsequent biochemical
studies for lipid dysmetabolism. Noteworthily,
the biochemical assays occasionally show normal results
between each episodes of metabolic decompensation,
thus mutation analyses of ETFA, ETFB and ETFDH may
be the most confirmative diagnostic method for MADD.
The characteristic features of muscle pathology are similar
to those seen in PCD (Fig. 2C).

Although the molecular mechanism of MADD is still
unclear, riboflavin supplementation (100-400 mg/day) has
been known to markedly improve the clinical symptoms
and metabolic profiles of many MADD patients, particularly
with ETFDH mutations and later onset form, as mentioned
previously. Several studies have shown that FAD,
comprised in many mitochondrial enzymes related to
electron transfer, may modulate the enzymatic phenotype
of mutations in the electron transfer proteins. It has been
observed that FAD level affects folding and maintenance
of the native structure of these proteins and could improve
their conformation and generate a more stable and active
enzyme in vitro (35). Accordingly, riboflavin should be
tried in all types of MADD patients. There is still a controversy
about the combination therapy with carnitine. It
could be helpful when secondary carnitine deficiency is
present. CoQ10 supplementation has also been reported to
improve muscle weakness in MADD patients with CoQ10
deficiency (23), together with riboflavin use. However,
as the CoQ10 level is not always decreased in MADD patients
(24), its supplementation should be considered only
when secondary CoQ10 deficiency is present.

Neutral lipid storage disease
with ichthyosis (NLSDI)
or myopathy (NLSDM)
Neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) is a rare lipid
storage disorder caused by defects in two TG-associated
proteins, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5)
(also called comparative gene identification-58 [CGI-
58)]). ATGL catalyzes TG and releases the first fatty acid
from the glycerol backbone and CGI-58 activates ATGL
and acylates lysophosphatidic acid. Activation of ATGL
initiates the hydrolytic catabolism of cellular TG stores to
glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids (Fig. 1). Therefore,
dysfunction of these two proteins apparently would affect
the degradation of TG, and then cause its accumulation.

Mutations in alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-containing
protein 5 (ABHD5) have been identified to cause
NLSDI, also known as Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome
(CDS) (36). However, some patients present atypical
CDS features, with myopathy and cardiomyopathy but
without ichthyosis and mutation in ABHD5. This phenotype
was called NLSDM and further facilitated the discovery
of new causative gene, patatin-like phospholipase
domain containing 2 (PNPLA2), encoding ATGL (37). So
far, the mutations in ABHD5 have been reported to cause
protein truncations but not absence, suggesting that the
mutant protein is not completely deficient but functionally
impaired (33). In NLSDM, almost all mutations in
PNPLA2 are located on C-terminal region, preserving
the proposed active site of the enzyme. These truncated
enzyme variants have later been shown impaired in their
ability to bind to cellular lipid droplets in vitro (38).

NLSD is characterized by systemic TG deposition
in multiple tissues, including skin, muscle, liver, central
nervous system, and blood leukocytes. Clinically, it is often
present with ichthyosis, mild myopathy, hepatomegaly
and, variably, ophthalmologic symptoms, neurosensory
hearing loss, mental retardation and short stature (39-41).
In NLSDI, the ichthyosis represents nonbullous congenital
ichthyosiform erythroderma and the weakness is usually
mild and predominant proximal. However, in NLSDM,
no ichthyosis is observed and the slowly progressive
muscle involvement could be in both proximal and distal
limbs, with a predominant distal weakness in some
patients. Importantly, the cardiomyopathy is exclusively
seen in almost half of the patients with NLSDM (41), but
not NLSDI while neurosensory defects and mental retardation
are commonly seen in NLSDI but not NLSDM.
CK level is usually mildly to moderately elevated.

The detection of lipid accumulation in leukocytes,
muscle fibers and fibroblasts is critical for the diagnosis
of NLSD as the clinical manifestations of NLSD are inconstant
and the biochemical investigations for lipid dysmetabolism
usually do not show any abnormality. The
intracytoplasmic lipid storage in leukocytes is visible on
peripheral blood smear, which is called Jordan’s anomaly.
In skeletal muscles, increased lipid droplets could be
observed even in presymptomatic period. Noteworthily,
rimmed vacuoles in the muscles were reported in some NLSDM patients (Fig. 2D) (42, 43), suggesting a different
pathomechanism from other LSMs, which might be
associated with membrane phospholipid abnormalities
caused by decreased DG availability.

So far, there is still no effective treatment in NLSD.
The functions of ATGL and CGI-58 are still largely unknown.
However, the production of the mice lacking
ATGL has provided an opportunity to prompt the understanding
of NSLDM (44), though unfortunately, the phenotype
of CGI-58-deficient mice has not been reported
yet. The elucidation of the biological role of CGI-58 in lipid
dysmetabolism and further development of therapeutic
strategy may be dependent on more detailed genetic
and clinical characterization of NSLDI patients and the
establishment of appropriate animal models.

Conclusions
Muscle lipid disease is phenotypically and genotypically
heterogeneous. The detailed observation of clinical
features combined with the distinct results of biochemical
assays is required. In addition, mutation analyses are usually
helpful for making the final diagnosis especially when clinical
phenotype and laboratory tests show indistinguishable
and nonspecific findings. Prompt diagnosis is important for
subsequent treatment of patients especially as carnitine and
riboflavin have shown excellent efficacy in the patients with
PCD and RR-MADD. Moreover, in many patients with lipid
dysmetabolism, the causative genes remain unknown.
Thus, to discover the novel causative genes and then further
explore the pathomechanism would be important missions
in the future studies on muscle lipid diseases.
