==== Body
Non-muscle myosin II (NMHC II) is an ubiquitously expressed protein present in all vertebrate cells. There are three known isoforms of NMHC II, namely NMHC II-A, II-B and II-C, that have a central role in cell adhesion and differentiation. NMHC II-A and B have been demonstrated to be present in human skeletal muscle and to localize to Z-lines. NMHC II-C mRNA and protein has been found widespread in human and mouse organs but its localization and function in human skeletal muscle have not been investigated. We performed single-labeling immunofluorescence, which showed that NMHC II-C is abundantly expressed in human skeletal muscle, with a transverse banding pattern of distribution. By double-labeling immunofluorescence with either slow myosin heavy chain, desmin, α-actin or α-actinin, we localized NMHC II-C overlying the Z-lines and in perinuclear regions. The abundance of this protein in association with Z-lines suggests that NMHC II-C might play a role in regulating muscle contractility or in maintaining integrity of the myofibrillar machinery. Further studies need to be performed to establish the exact role of NMHC II-C in normal and diseased skeletal muscle.
