==== Body
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder, in 90% of cases antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchRAb) are pathogenetic. Antibodies reduce acetylcholine receptors (AChR) number and impair their function at the neuromuscular endplate. The main feature is a variable weakness of the skeletal muscles, that may involve different districts. Symptoms are typically worse in the evening or after prolonged exercise and can be reduced with rest. The diagnosis is based on a detailed clinical history and neuromuscular examination, on pharmacological tests, measurement of AchRAb, and on appropriate neurophysiologic tests. Therapy involves the use of symptomatic drugs that can improve neuromuscular transmission, immunosuppressive and immunomodulant therapy, and thymectomy. 

The task of our study was to compare the efficacy of different immunosuppressive regimens in patients with MG.

We carried out a study in 98 patients at the Clinical Centre for Neuromuscular diseases of Padova University: 36 were treated by combined immunotherapy with corticosteroids and Azathioprine (CS and AZA), 13 of them treated with a combination of corticosteroids and Cyclosporine (CS and CsA), and a third group of 49 patients in treatment with only corticosteroids (CS). We also report a follow-up study of 5 patients treated with Mycophenolate mofetil (MMT). All patients were evaluated using the MGFA (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) clinical classification. Appropriate statistics have been performed, with multivariate analysis and Student T tests.

To evaluate the outcome of the 98 patients of the study, we considered the difference between patients with a MGFA score equal to zero (patients asymptomatic or in pharmacological remission) and patients with MGFA score different from zero (symptomatic, with various grades of severity). After one year of treatment the percentage of pharmacological remissions or asymptomatic status in the group of patients treated with AZA and CS resulted greater than in the group of patients treated with only corticosteroids or both with CsA and CS. Side effects resulted significantly (p < 0.0001) common in the groups of patients treated with the therapeutical combination of immunosuppressors, than in the group treated just with steroids. Three out of 5 patients treated with MMT achieved an improvement within the first year of treatment.

Combined therapy with immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids, significantly increases the number and frequency of side effects (p < 0.0001). Our findings also reveal that Cushing's syndrome and osteoporosis were significantly common among patients treated only with steroids (p < 0.003 and p < 0.03). Additional studies are required to confirm the role of Mycophenolate Mofetil in the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis.
