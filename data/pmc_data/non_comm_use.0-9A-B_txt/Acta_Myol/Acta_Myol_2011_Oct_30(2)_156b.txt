Disease advocacy groups (DAGs) by and large arise in chronic or devastating diseases for which persistent unmet needs exist. Patients seek DAGs for a variety of reasons, but most importantly to find immediate psychological, diagnostic, and therapeutic coping mechanisms. Factors that drive their continued involvement include hope for finding a permanent cure and an altruistic desire to increase awareness and share their experiences to help others in similar need. In doing so, they frequently establish a conduit to world experts in their rare disorder, and where needed, better define disease characteristics and management. 

DAGs provide help to their members in a variety of ways:

offer web-based, easily accessible and medically reliable information to patients about their condition;

offer a means of members to interact either through email list serves, blogs, or message boards;

organize annual meetings for members, whereby disease experts and members can interact face to face;

offer a virtual interface between medical experts and their membership via on-line "Ask The Experts";

potentiate blood banking and genetic research by gathering relatively large numbers of patients in one repository;

organize and galvanize scientific and medical experts to research the condition;

motivate experts to help the DAG members.

Physicians are the ultimate backbone of any DAG that wishes to provide more than psychosocial coping modalities for their members. Members ultimately seek credible medical knowledge as the best chance to navigate their illness and achieve normalcy in their lives. The fundamental ways in which physicians can support a DAG is by being actively available to attend DAG member conferences, answer member questions, contribute to website content, and cooperate to establish consensus protocols for diagnosis and therapy, and work with each other to find meaningful diagnostic modalities and treatments.

Barriers to a DAG's achieving its mission are many. DAGs often lack funding, frequently suffer from disinterest by a majority of the few medical experts interested in their disease, are sometimes hurt by splinter groups for the same disease fragmenting limited resources, and may find themselves caught between political or personality differences among their medical experts.

Barriers to physician participation in DAGs are many: competition for time of the physician by other diseases, limited time to deal with individual patient concerns, medico-legal uncertainties of interactions with DAG members, lack of recognition or peer reviewed publication credit for writing website content, cost of travel to meetings, having only non-clinical research interest, and knowledge in only a limited aspect of a disease in question.
