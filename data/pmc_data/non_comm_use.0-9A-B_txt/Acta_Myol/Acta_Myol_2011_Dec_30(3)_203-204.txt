==== Body
Pompe disease is a single disease continuum that includes variable neuromuscular symptoms and rates of progression. However, specific clinical features, such as an early onset of respiratory problems preceding limb muscular weakness, distinguish Pompe disease from other neuromuscular diseases in which respiratory insufficiency occurs after loss of ambulation. 

The management of Pompe disease also differs from other neuromuscular diseases in that specific treatment is now available, making early recognition of the disease a priority. Late-onset form of Pompe disease, that may occur at any age after the first year of life, is characterized by slow and progressive loss of function of skeletal muscles. Respiratory failure is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The evaluation and monitoring of parameters such as FVC, MIP, MEP, blood gases, together with the clinical examination can delineate the profile and the decline in lung function, in order to provide early and effective therapeutic intervention. In patients with restrictive chest wall disease, the indication in VMD should be in the presence of symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, morning headaches, disturbed sleep, daytime hypersomnia associated with one of the following criteria: PaCO2 > 45 mmHg; episodes of desaturation during a night-time monitoring (SaO2 <88% for 5 consecutive minutes); MIP < 60 cm H2O or a FVC < 50% of predicted values in patients with progressive neuromuscular diseases. According to the international consensus additional physiological criteria are: PaO2 in the waking state and during clinical stability < 60 mmHg, vital capacity (VC) < 20-30% predicted or < 1.0 L, maximum pressure inspiratory (MIP) < 30 cm H2O, unlike the CV in the transition from upright to supine position > 25%; tachypnoea: respiratory rate > 27 breaths / min. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation helps patients to breathe when the muscle becomes deficient. It interacts with the patient having an adequate alveolar ventilation, improving oxygenation and reducing hypercapnia. Patients treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation have reduced dyspnea and hypersomnia and improved sleep; also fatigue disappeared in most patients.

In patients with Pompe disease progressive muscle weakness renders ineffective the mechanism of cough, with stagnation of secretions. This causes atelectasias, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure with need for frequent hospitalization. airway clearance techniques can facilitate the mobilization and removal of secretions that clutter the airways. The use of airway clearance techniques, including assisted coughing techniques, both manual and mechanical, and secretion mobilization techniques, is strongly recommended. These techniques should always be included in the treatment of chronic NMD patients. Chest percussion and vibration can help to mobilize peripheral airway secretions but they are not substitutes for coughing and, unlike for assisted coughing, have never been shown to decrease pulmonary morbidity and mortality. Cough can be assisted by manual and mechanical means. There are a wide variety of techniques available from which to choose, ranging from manual techniques to mechanically assisted maneuvers. The possibility of using devices for assisted coughing should be individually evaluated.
