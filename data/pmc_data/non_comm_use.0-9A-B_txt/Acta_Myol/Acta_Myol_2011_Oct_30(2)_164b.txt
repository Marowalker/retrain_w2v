==== Body
In recent years, a flurry of epidemiological studies has confirmed the notion that mitochondrial disorders (MD) are among the most common genetic disorders and a major burden for society. However, in contrast to the extraordinary progress in our understanding of the biochemical and molecular bases of MD, we are still extremely limited in our ability to treat these conditions. Small patient populations represent the major impediment to progress in research and care. The development, by a multicenter nationwide collaborative network, of a web-based register of patients with MD will be helpful to better understand the phenotypes and the natural history of these diseases.

The GUP09004 Telethon-Clinical Grant project started on January 2010. Eleven Centers with expertise on MD have been involved. The initial phases ("establishment of the steering committee and the oversee committee" and "development and validation of the register") are completed and, having discussed some ethical, procedural and statistical issues, a data matrix has been defined including the more relevant clinical and laboratory parameters, such as: patient code, family code, date of birth, gender, region of origin, ethnicity, family history, diagnosis, year of diagnosis, age at onset, form, first symptoms, clinical features, clinical course, date and cause of death, Newcastle Scale scores, date of the last contact, plasmatic/urinary/CSF biomarkers, neuro-ophtalmological features, neuroradiologic features, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, histological findings, respiratory chain complexes complexes, pyruvate dehydrogenase, molecular analysis (southern blotting, long PCR, real time PCR, nuclear DNA genotype, mtDNA genotype with haplogroups) and therapy. By using a digitalized version of this matrix 145 patients from the 11 participating Centers have been charged on the database.

The ongoing phase provides a validation step of the database build-up by reassessment of all the cases in each Center, preliminary to the web-database where the obtained data will be transferred for an estimated population of nearly 3000 patients.

Possible future applications, based on such nation-wide Italian collaborative network, will include: epidemiological studies, phenotype-genotype correlations, disease natural history definition, multicenter clinical trials.
