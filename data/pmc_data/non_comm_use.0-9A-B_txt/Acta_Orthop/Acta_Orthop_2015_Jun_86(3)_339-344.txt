 Ultrasound is used for imaging of pseudotumors associated with metal-on-metal (MoM) hips.
Ultrasound has been compared with magnetic resonance imaging, but to date there have been no studies
comparing ultrasound findings and revision findings.

Methods
 We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of preoperative ultrasound for detecting
pseudotumors in 82 patients with MoM hip replacement (82 hips). Ultrasound examinations were
performed by 1 of 3 musculoskeletal radiologists, and pseudotumors seen by ultrasound were
retrospectively classified as fluid-filled, mixed-type, or solid. Findings at revision surgery were
retrieved from surgical notes and graded according to the same system as used for ultrasound
findings.

Results
 Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI: 63–93) and a specificity of 92% (CI:
82–96) for detecting trochanteric region pseudotumors, and a sensitivity of 79% (CI:
62–89) and a specificity of 94% (CI: 83–98) for detecting iliopsoas-region pseudotumors.
Type misclassification of pseudotumors found at revision occurred in 8 of 23 hips in the
trochanteric region and in 19 of 33 hips in the iliopsoas region.

Interpretation
 Despite the discrepancy in type classification between ultrasound and revision findings, the
presence of pseudotumors was predicted well with ultrasound in our cohort of failed MoM hip
replacements.
==== Body
Several authors have reported periarticular soft tissue lesions called pseudotumors in
association with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements (Pandit
et al. 2008, Langton et al. 2011). Many patients
with adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMD) present with elevated blood cobalt (Co) and chromium
(Cr) levels and symptoms such as pain and discomfort in the hip and groin region (Toms et al. 2008, Hart et
al. 2011). Some patients are asymptomatic, however, with normal metal ion levels—but
they have still developed a pseudotumor (Toms et al.
2008, Wynn-Jones et al. 2011, Hart et al. 2012).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) are the main radiological imaging modalities
for pseudotumors in MoM hips (Ostlere 2011). MRI produces
artifacts because of the metal implant. Metal artifact-reduction sequences have been used to reduce
this, but residual artifact remains and obscures the tissues that are directly adjacent (Sofka et al. 2006). US images are not compromised by metal
artifacts, and US provides images with good soft tissue resolution of both intracapsular lesions and
extracapsular pseudotumors. However, US may have limited value in the evaluation of deep lesions
(Ostlere 2011). Most of the recent publications on
cross-sectional imaging of MoM hips have concentrated on evaluation of MRI as the main imaging tool
in pseudotumor diagnostics. The sensitivity and specificity of US have been reported in relation to
MRI (Nishii et al. 2014, Siddiqui et al. 2014, Garbuz et al.
2014), but to our knowledge, these have not been compared to revision findings.

We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of US for detecting pseudotumors in a cohort of
patients with failed MoM hip replacements. A secondary aim was to determine how well the
preoperative US classification of pseudotumors would match the perioperative surgical findings. To
achieve this, we compared preoperative US findings with perioperative surgical findings in patients
with MoM hip replacements who underwent revision surgery at our institution.

Materials and methods
Study population
In 2010, the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency announced a
medical device alert regarding ASR hip replacement implants (Articular Surface Replacement; DePuy
Orthopaedics, Warsaw, IN) (MHRA 2010). After the announcement, we established a mass-screening
program to identify possible articulation-related complications in patients who had undergone either
ASR hip resurfacing (HR) or ASR total hip replacement (THR) at our institution. As part of the
screening, all patients were referred for cross-sectional imaging. MRI was our primary imaging
modality, but if MRI was contraindicated or could not be done due to patient-related factors, US was
used. Systematic screening of MoM component models other than ASR began in January 2012. Screening
included whole-blood metal ion measurements, Oxford hip score questionnaire, and clinical
examination as with ASR patients, but systematic cross-sectional imaging was not performed. MRI or
US was performed if a patient was symptomatic or if whole-blood Co or Cr levels were higher than 5
ppb (Hart et al. 2011).

MoM hip replacements were used in 2,904 operations at our institution between January 2001 and
November 2011. Before May 2013, 433 MoM hips (in 397 patients) had undergone revision surgery.
Pre-revision US imaging was available for 125 hips (117 patients). We excluded those hips that had
been imaged with US more than 12 months before revision surgery; this decision was based on our
previous study, in which the sensitivity of MRI to detect pseudotumors remained at the same level up
to 1 year after imaging and decreased thereafter, most likely due to the evolving nature of
pseudotumors (Lainiala et al. 2014). Thus, we assumed
that US imaging performed more than 12 months before revision surgery would also be unreliable. 116
hips (in 109 patients) had undergone US less than a year before revision surgery. To reduce bias
caused by previous imaging, we ruled out hips that had had MRI examination less than 1 year before
US examination (30 hips, 27 patients). Of the remaining 86 hips (in 82 patients, 50 of whom were
females), 22 had undergone MRI over 1 year before US. To avoid bias from clustered observations
(i.e. 2 hips in the same patient analyzed as independent observations (Ranstam et al. 2011)), only the right hip of bilateral patients was analyzed.
78 revisions were performed due to ARMD, 2 for infection, 1 for aseptic loosening of the acetabular
component, and 1 for malposition of the acetabular component, associated with pain and sensation of
subluxation. 82 hips in 82 patients were included in the final analyses. Failure was considered to
be secondary to ARMD if metallosis, macroscopic synovitis, and/or extracapsular pseudotumors were
found during revision—and/or a moderate-to-large amount of perivascular lymphocytes along with
tissue necrosis and/or fibrin deposition was seen in the histopathological sample (Reito et al. 2013). Component loosening and periprosthetic
fracture had to be ruled out clinically and radiologically in order to set a diagnosis of ARMD.
Infection was ruled out if all (at least 5) culture results from the samples obtained during
revision surgery were negative.

The 64 THRs included were 35 ASR implants, 2 M2a-Magnum (Biomet, Warsaw, IN), 3 Mitch (Finsbury
Orthopaedics, Leatherhead, UK), 9 Pinnacle (DePuy), 6 R3 (Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN), 3 ReCap
(Biomet), 4 Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR; Smith and Nephew), 1 Durom (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN), and 1
Conserve Plus (Wright Medical Technology, Memphis, TN). There were also 18 hip resurfacings
involving 9 ASR and 9 BHR implants. Mean age of the patient at the time of revision was 63
(20–81) years. Mean time between primary operation and revision was 5.4 (1.9–11) years
and median time between US and revision was 4.1 (0.3–11) months (Table 1, see Supplementary data).

Revisions
All revisions were performed by or under the direct supervision of 4 experienced hip revision
surgeons. Revision was considered if a pseudotumor with solid component was seen by US regardless of
symptoms and/or blood Co and Cr levels, if a patient had a symptomatic hip and elevated blood metal
ion levels, or if a patient had persistent and/or severe symptoms (Reito et al. 2013). All operations were performed according to a standard
protocol involving the posterior approach, paying special attention to the excision of all abnormal
metal-contaminated tissue.

Revision findings were retrieved from surgical notes and graded as fluid-filled, solid, or
mixed-type based on the surgeon’s description of the consistency, content, and wall thickness
of pseudotumors. We considered all extracapsular fluid-filled lesions or mass lesions with variable
connection to the joint capsule to be pseudotumors. Cystic lesions with thin walls were graded as
fluid-filled pseudotumors. Extracapsular lesions with no or only minor fluid-like component were
graded as solid pseudotumors. Mixed-type was defined as being mainly fluid-filled, but also having
thick walls and/or solid contents. We divided pseudotumors into iliopsoas (anterior) region
pseudotumors and trochanteric (posterolateral) region pseudotumors, which in our experience are the
2 most usual locations for extracapsular pseudotumors in MoM hips.

Ultrasound examination
Each examination was performed with a Logiq E9 ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare) by 1 of 3
musculoskeletal radiologists. In most cases, an ML 6-15-D linear transducer was used (4.5–15.0
MHz, 13 × 58 mm footprint, field of view (FOV) 50 mm, and depth of field (DOF) 8 cm). However,
in cases with poor visibility due to obesity, a 9L-D linear transducer (2.4–10.0 MHz, 14
× 53 mm footprint, FOV 45 mm, and DOF 12 cm) or a C1-5 convex transducer (1.6–6.0 MHz,
17 × 75 mm footprint, FOV 65 degrees, and DOF 35 cm) was used. An anterior approach was used
to evaluate the hip joint, the iliopsoas muscle, and the tendon region. A lateral approach was used
to evaluate the greater trochanteric and deep fascia region. Posteriorly, the hip joint and the
trochanteric and gluteal regions were examined. Pseudotumors were classified retrospectively
according to the same classification as for the revision findings based on the consistency, content,
and wall thickness of pseudotumors described by the radiologist (Figures 1–3). Intracapsular findings were not classified systematically and were
therefore excluded from analysis. Doppler was not used in examinations. Synovial fluid aspirates
were not acquired routinely during the US examination.

Statistics
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for detection of trochanteric and iliopsoas-region
pseudotumors with US (Herbert 2013). Kappa coefficient
was calculated for statistical comparison of differences in classification between US and revision
surgery findings. To assess the effect of time between US examination and revision surgery on the
calculated sensitivity and specificity, we divided the study population into 2 equal-sized groups
based on the median time between US and revision (3.5 months). Sensitivity, specificity, and kappa
coefficient with 95% CIs were calculated for each group separately. We used IBM SPSS Statistics
version 20.

Ethics
The institutional review board approved the study (April 27, 2011; R11006) and the procedures
followed were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

Results
Pseudotumors were found in 46 of 82 hips during the revision surgery. A trochanteric region
pseudotumor was found in 13 hips and an ilipsoas region pseudotumor was found in 23 hips. In 10
hips, a pseudotumor was found in both the iliopsoas region and the trochanteric region.

Trochanteric region pseudotumors
Preoperative US showed 19 of the 23 posterolaterally located pseudotumors found during revision
surgery. The 4 pseudotumors that were not detected with US were fluid-filled and thin-walled (here,
mean time between US and revision was 4.5 (2.7–7.3) months). 4 fluid-filled pseudotumors and 1
mixed-type pseudotumor were also seen in preoperative US but they were not found during revision
surgery (here, mean time between US and revision was 4.5 (2.1–7.3) months for the fluid-filled
pseudotumors and the actual time was 4.4 months for the mixed-type pseudotumor). Thus, US had a
sensitivity of 83% (95% CI: 63–93) and a specificity of 92% (95% CI: 82–96) for
detecting pseudotumors in the trochanteric region (Table 2).
Cross-tabulation of US and revision findings in trochanteric region is given in Table 3.

14 of the 18 fluid-filled pseudotumors found in revision surgery were correctly classified in US
also. None of the 4 mixed-type pseudotumors were correctly graded in preoperative US examination.
The kappa coefficient calculated from Table 3 was 0.64 (good
agreement; 95% CI: 0.47–0.80).

Iliopsoas-region pseudotumors
Preoperative US revealed 26 of the 33 anteriorly located pseudotumors found in revision surgery.
All 7 pseudotumors that were not detected with US were fluid-filled (here, mean time between US and
revision was 3.8 (1.3–6.1) months). 1 solid and 2 fluid-filled pseudotumors seen in
preoperative US were not found during revision surgery (here, time between US and revision was 3.2
months for the solid pseudotumor and 2.1 and 8.0 months for the fluid-filled pseudotumors). US had a
sensitivity of 79% (95% CI: 62–89) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI: 83–98) for
detecting pseudotumors located in the iliopsoas region (Table
2). Cross-tabulation of US and revision findings in the iliopsoas region is given in Table 4.

8 of the 21 fluid-filled pseudotumors and 6 of the 8 mixed-type pseudotumors found in revision
surgery were accordingly classified in preoperative US also. Of the 4 solid pseudotumors found in
revision, 3 were classified as mixed-type and 1 was classified as fluid-filled by US. The kappa
coefficient calculated from Table 4 was 0.52 (moderate
agreement; 95% CI: 0.38–0.66).

The effect of time between US and revision surgery on sensitivity, specificity, and kappa
coefficient
There was no statistically significant difference when we compared the patients with 3.5 months
or less between the US and revision to the patients for whom the time interval in question exceeded
3.5 months.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare pseudotumors detected by US to those
encountered in revision surgery. To date, the sensitivity and specificity of US have been estimated
in relation to MRI (Nishii et al. 2014, Siddiqui et al. 2014, Garbuz et al. 2014). Siddiqui et al. (2014)
compared US findings in 19 MoM hips to findings by MRI, which they considered to be the gold
standard. They reported poor sensitivity in detecting pseudotumors with US relative to MRI (69%) and
recommended that MRI should be used as the first-line examination because of the higher accuracy.
They also stressed the anatomical information provided by MRI, which can be used for preoperative
planning. Nishii et al. (2014) also evaluated the
sensitivity and specificity of US by comparing it to MRI. They found a sensitivity of 74% and a
specificity of 92%, with US failing to detect 7 of 27 abnormal lesions detected with MRI and MRI
failing to detect 3 of 23 lesions seen with US. The authors stated that they considered MRI to be a
more reliable screening method but that they considered US to be a primary screening tool due to its
better availability, lower cost, and possibly more reliable detection of small lesions. Garbuz et al. (2014) evaluated the sensitivity and specificity
of US and MRI in 40 MoM hips by determining the agreement between them using MRI as gold standard.
They found a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96% for US and a sensitivity of 92% and a
specificity of 100% for MRI, and they argued that US should be used as the primary imaging modality
due to the significantly lower costs.

In the present study, 11 fluid-filled pseudotumors were found at revision but not at the
preoperative US, and 6 fluid-filled pseudotumors were seen at the US but not at revision. 1
mixed-type pseudotumor seen by US in the trochanteric region and 1 solid pseudotumor seen in the
iliopsoas region were also not found during revision surgery. All cases with false-negative US
findings had thin-walled and fluid-filled pseudotumors. In a recent study, Almousa et al. (2013) tried to analyze the natural history of inflammatory
pseudotumors and they found that asymptomatic pseudotumors frequently increased and decreased in
size, with occasional remission of small masses. In our previous study, we found low sensitivity for
MRI images that were over 1 year old, most likely due to the developing nature of lesions (Lainiala et al. 2014). The actual change in lesions might
explain the false negatives and false positives, and also some of the misclassified cases in the
present study. In this study, there was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity and
specificity between the patients with ≤ 3.5 months and > 3.5 months between the US and the
revision, but there was a small number of patients in the subgroup analysis. Furthermore, the
lesions lay deep in patients with excessive subcutaneous tissue, which may also explain some
false-negative findings.

Even though it has been suggested that asymptomatic fluid-filled pseudotumors may be of less
importance clinically (Hart et al. 2012), the natural
history of these lesions is still unclear. Almousa et al.
(2013) found that some of the asymptomatic pseudotumors increased in size, transforming from
cystic to solid, and they found abductor and iliopsoas muscle damage in a few cases with increasing
pseudotumor size. Furthermore, Grammatopolous et al.
(2009) reported poor results for MoM hip revisions performed due to pseudotumors. They also
speculated that one of the reasons for the poor outcome of such revisions might be the excessive
tissue resection needed in cases with vast soft tissue abnormalities. It therefore seems reasonable
to follow up patients with cystic lesions by repeated cross-sectional imaging. In our opinion, this
is important to detect and revise aggressively expanding lesions early enough to minimize soft
tissue destruction.

The study had some limitations. Each patient was imaged only once. Thus, we were unable to assess
inter- and intra-observer reliability. At the time that the US examinations and revisions were
performed, there was no published pseudotumor classification for US or perioperative findings. On
the basis of typical findings encountered during revision surgeries of failed MoM hips at our
institution and previous MRI classifications (Anderson et al.
2011, Hart et al. 2012, Hauptfleisch et al. 2012), we decided to classify pseudotumors as being
fluid-filled, mixed-type, or solid. A similar description was used for US findings. Due to the
retrospective analysis of the US findings, the re-grading of pseudotumors was not done in blinded
fashion and may have been biased. We tried to reduce the bias caused by previous imaging results
seen by radiologists who performed the US examinations by excluding the patients with MRI performed
shortly before US. The most important reason for misclassification of pseudotumors in US is probably
the lack of a prospective grading scheme for the perioperative findings—i.e. different
surgeons may have described the lesions differently. Even though the type of pseudotumor was often
misclassified, we consider that reporting of the presence or absence of pseudotumors was reliable
since our institution recognized the problem with MoM hip-related pseudotumors early, and the
surgeons were aware that soft tissue pathologies might be encountered. Our study cohort included
revised patients only. Thus, the prevalence of pseudotumors was certainly higher in this study
cohort than in the whole MoM population. Moreover, we do not know the number of possible
false-negative findings in asymptomatic patients who also had normal blood metal ion levels and were
therefore not considered for revision surgery. Due to this fact, the sensitivity of US may appear
higher than it really is. The surgeons performing the revision operations were aware of the US
findings, which may have affected the way in which they described the lesions that they found, but
this is an in-built problem with this type of study.

In summary, the presence of pseudotumors was predicted well with US in our cohort of failed MoM
hips. However, there was discrepancy in the classification of lesions in US examination and in
revision surgery.
