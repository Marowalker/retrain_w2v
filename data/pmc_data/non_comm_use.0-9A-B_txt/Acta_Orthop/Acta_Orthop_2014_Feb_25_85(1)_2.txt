==== Body
Amgen, the producer of denosumab, has warned about the risk of atypical fractures after seeing suspected cases in a long-term trial. No publications on these cases are available. When this editorial was published online in October 2013, the case report by Drampalos et al. (2014) in this issue of Acta Orthopaedica was the first atypical fracture associated with denosumab in the literature indexed in PubMed. In December 2013, another case was published online (Thompson et al. 2013), and a third case has been added to the printed version of this issue (Schilcher and Aspenberg 2014).
