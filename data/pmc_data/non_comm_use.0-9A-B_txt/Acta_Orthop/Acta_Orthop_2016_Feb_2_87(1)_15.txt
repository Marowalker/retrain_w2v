Open Access, no copyright
Since 2005, Acta Orthopaedica has been a platinum Open Access journal. This means that all articles from 1930 until now are immediately free for everyone to read and download. Acta has no copyright on articles, which are all published under a Creative Commons Licence that permits all non-commercial use of them.

Platinum Open Access means that the authors pay nothing for the editorial work, the color printing, and electronic and paper distribution. To keep this running, the journal requires a low-budget management. It is a non-profit journal owned by the Nordic Orthopaedic Federation, which covers all the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) and the Netherlands and Estonia.

Unfortunately the term ”Open Access” has been soiled by so-called predatory publishers. This is a quickly growing group of commercial enterprises that rapidly, and electronically only, publish submitted manuscripts for a certain cost to the authors (and considerable economic gain for the company). These companies use no or insufficient peer review (it is of course of no interest to the firms to reject submitted manuscripts), which means that a lot of poor-quality articles are published. Thus, ”Open Access” is wrongly considered by many to be a sign of a low-quality journal. For an overview of predatory publishers, see (http://scholarlyoa.com/2015/01/02/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers-2015/ and http://mobile.the-scientist.com/article/43914/opinion-pay-to-play-publishing).

Manuscript handling
Acta Orthopaedica has a rigorous peer-review system. All the manuscripts that are accepted have been scrutinized by external expert reviewers, by our biostatistician (who surprisingly often finds a tendency of authors to overestimate the strength and general applicability of their findings!) and by an experienced language/copy editor.

Acta receives around 1,000 manuscripts annually, <15% of which are finally accepted and published. We believe that this selection process leaves only high-quality articles, as reflected by our latest impact factor (2.8, according to Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science), which compares favorably with those of the other large general orthopedic journals.

Handling times and App
Manuscripts that are not appropriate for Acta’s readership or that are of insufficient quality are immediately rejected. Of the others that are sent for peer review, most authors get an answer within 4–8 weeks. Manuscripts accepted after revision(s) are published electronically (PubMed) within a few weeks after the authors have approved the proofs. They can also easily be found with our App (Acta was the first orthopedic journal to be available on an App, in 2011), which also gives access to all the articles published since the start of our journal in 1930. The print version of an article will usually appear within 6–10 months; this delay is of minor importance because of the rapid electronic open-access publication.

Supplements
Acta Orthopaedica has decided to give up the long tradition of publishing doctoral theses as Supplements; we have published 360 Supplements altogether, almost all of them Scandinavian doctoral theses. An overview of the 345 Supplements from 1934–2011 has been published (Hansson and Rydholm 2011).

The reasons for this change are the steeply increasing production and postage costs, and because nowadays all theses are available electronically from the respective universities. Furthermore, for many years Scandinavian theses have been based on a series of already published articles.

New printing paper
Some of you will perhaps note that this issue is thinner than usual. This is not because of less content but because of thinner paper. This change is also justified by increasing costs; the thinner paper will reduce the cost of postage. Also, your copy of Acta will now be able to be easily compressed into your white coat pocket for immediate access in work pauses!

Acta Orthopaedica welcomes criticism, especially negative criticism that may help to improve our journal. So please e-mail me: anders.rydholm@med.lu.se
