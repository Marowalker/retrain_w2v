We investigate a second-order dynamical system with variable damping in connection with the minimization of a nonconvex differentiable function. The dynamical system is formulated in the spirit of the differential equation which models Nesterov's accelerated convex gradient method. We show that the generated trajectory converges to a critical point, if a regularization of the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka- Lojasiewicz property. We also provide convergence rates for the trajectory formulated in terms of the Lojasiewicz exponent.

1. Introduction
Consider the (not necessarily convex) optimization problem
 (1) infx∈Rng(x),  where g:Rn⟶R is a Fréchet differentiable function with Lg-Lipschitz continuous gradient, i.e. there exists Lg≥0 such that ∥∇g(x)−∇g(y)∥≤Lg∥x−y∥ for all x,y∈Rn. We associate to (1) the second-order dynamical system (for t≥t0)
 (2) x¨(t)+αt+γx˙(t)+∇g(x(t))=0,x(t0)=u0,x˙(t0)=v0,  where t0>0,u0,v0∈Rn,α∈R and γ∈(0,+∞).

The study of the system (2) is motivated by the recent developments related to the approaching of the solving of convex optimization problems from a continuous perspective.

In [1], Su, Boyd and Candes proposed the following dynamical system
 (3) x¨(t)+αtx˙(t)+∇g(x(t))=0,x(t0)=u0,x˙(t0)=v0,  as the continuous counterpart of the Nesterov's accelerated gradient method [see [2]] for minimizing g in the convex case. This research has been deepened by Attouch and his co-authors [see [3,4]], who proved that, if α>3, then the generated trajectory x(t) converges to a minimizer of g as t→+∞, while the convergence rate of the objective function along the trajectory is o(1/t2). The convergence of the trajectory is actually the continuous counterpart of a result due to Chambolle and Dossal [see [5]], which proves the convergence of the iterates of the modified FISTA algorithm [see [6]].

Recently, in [7], investigations have been performed concerning the convergence rate of the objective function along the trajectory in the subcritical case α≤3, while some open questions related to the asymptotic properties of the trajectory have been formulated.

In this manuscript, we carry out, in the nonconvex setting, an asymptotic analysis of the dynamical system (2), which can be seen as a perturbation of the dynamical system (3) that models Nesterov's accelerated gradient method in the convex case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution addressing
second-order dynamical systems with variable damping associated to nonconvex optimization problems. We show that the generated trajectory converges to a critical point of g as t→+∞, provided the following regularization of g,
 H:Rn×Rn⟶R,H(u,v)=g(u)+12∥u−v∥2,  satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz inequality. Moreover, we derive convergence rates in the terms of Łojasiewicz exponent, for the trajectory, its velocity and its acceleration. One of the major future goals is to study the asymptotic properties of the system (2) in case γ=0. For other investigations of the asymptotic analysis of
second-order dynamical systems with time-dependent damping, we refer to the papers of Haraux and Jendoubi [8] and Balti [9].

For α=0, the convergence of the trajectory generated by (2) to a critical point of g has been shown by Bégout, Bolte and Jendoubi in [10] in the hypothesis that g is of class C2 and it satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property with a desingularizing function satisfying a restrictive condition [see also the papers of Haraux and Jendoubi [11] and Chill and Jendoubi [12]]. On the other hand, the dynamical system (2) is, for α=0, a particular instance of the second-order dynamical system of proximal-gradient type studied in [13].

The following numerical scheme, with starting points x0,x1∈Rn,
 (4) (∀k≥1) yk=xk+(1−γs)k−αγsk+α(xk−xk−1),xk+1=yk−s∇g(yk),  where s≤1/Lg is the step size, can be seen as a discrete counterpart of (2). One can notice that for γ=0, this iterative scheme algorithm is similar to Nesterov's accelerated convex gradient method.

In the following, we prove that (2) can be seen in an informal way as the exact limit of (4)). We take to this end in (4) small step sizes and follow the same approach as Su, Boyd and Candes in [1, Section 2]. For this purpose, we rewrite (4) in the form
 (5) xk+1−xks=(1−γs)k−αγsk+α⋅xk−xk−1s−s∇g(yk)∀k≥1  and introduce the Ansatz
xk≈x(ks) for some twice continuously differentiable function x:[0,+∞)→Rn. We let k=t/s and get x(t)≈xk,x(t+s)≈xk+1,x(t−s)≈xk−1. Then, as the step size s goes to zero, from the Taylor expansion of x, we obtain
 xk+1−xks=x˙(t)+12x¨(t)s+o(s)  and
 xk−xk−1s=x˙(t)−12x¨(t)s+o(s). 

Furthermore, since
 s∥∇g(yk)−∇g(xk)∥≤sLg∥yk−xk∥=sLg(1−γs)k−αγsk+α∥xk−xk−1∥=o(s),  it follows s∇g(yk)=s∇g(xk)+o(s). Consequently, (5) can be written as
 x˙(t)+12x¨(t)s+o(s)=(1−γs)t−αγst+αsx˙(t)−12x¨(t)s+o(s)−s∇g(x(t))+o(s)  or, equivalently
 (t+αs)(x˙(t)+12x¨(t)s+o(s))=((1−γs)t−αγs)(x˙(t)−12x¨(t)s+o(s))−s(t+αs)∇g(x(t))+o(s).  Hence,
 12(2t+αs−γts−αγs)x¨(t)s+(γts+αs+αγs)x˙(t)+s(t+αs)∇g(x(t))=o(s).  After dividing by s and letting s→0, we obtain
 tx¨(t)+(γt+α)x˙(t)+t∇g(x(t))=0,  which, after division by t, gives (2), namely
 x¨(t)+αt+γx˙(t)+∇g(x(t))=0. 

2. Existence and uniqueness of the trajectory
We consider on the finite-dimensional space Rn the Euclidean topology. If x∈Rn is a local minimizer of g, then ∇g(x)=0. We denote by
 crit(g)={x∈Rn:∇g(x)=0}  the set of critical points of g.

We are considering in the asymptotic analysis of the dynamical system (2) strong global solutions.

Definition 2.1 We say that x:[t0,+∞)→Rn is a strong global solution of (2), if the following properties are satisfied:
x,x˙:[t0,+∞)→Rn are locally absolutely continuous, in other words, absolutely continuous on each interval [t0,T] for t0<T<+∞;

x¨(t)+(α/t+γ)x˙(t)+∇g(x(t))=0 for almost every t≥t0;

x(t0)=u0 and x˙(t0)=v0.



Recall that a function x:[t0,+∞)→Rn is absolutely continuous on an interval [t0,T], if there exists an integrable function y:[t0,T]→Rn such that
 x(t)=x(0)+∫t0ty(s)ds∀t∈[t0,T].  It follows from the definition that an absolutely continuous function is differentiable almost everywhere, its derivative coincides with its distributional derivative almost everywhere and one can recover the function from its derivative x˙=y by the integration formula above. On the other hand, if x:[t0,T]→Rn (where T>t0) is absolutely continuous and B:Rn→Rn is L-Lipschitz continuous (where L≥0), then the function B∘x is absolutely continuous, too. Moreover, B∘x is almost everywhere differentiable and the inequality ∥(d/dt)B(x(t))∥≤L∥x˙(t)∥ holds for almost every t≥t0 [see [14,15]].

We prove existence and uniqueness of a strong global solution of (2) by making use of the Cauchy–Lipschitz–Picard Theorem for absolutely continues trajectories [see for example [16, Proposition 6.2.1], [17, Theorem 54]]. The key argument is that one can rewrite (2) as a particular first-order dynamical system in a suitably chosen product space [see also [18]].

Theorem 2.1 For every starting points u0,v0∈Rn there exists a unique strong global solution of the dynamical system (2).

Proof. By making use of the notation X(t)=(x(t),x˙(t)), the system (2) can be rewritten as a first-order dynamical system:
 (6) X˙(t)=F(t,X(t)),X(t0)=(u0,v0),  where F:[t0,+∞)×Rn×Rn⟶Rn×Rn,F(t,u,v)=(v,−(α/t+γ)v−∇g(u)).

First we show that F(t,⋅,⋅) is L(t)-Lipschitz continuous for every t≥t0 and that the Lipschitz constant is a function of time with the property that L(⋅)∈Lloc1([t0,+∞)). Indeed, for every (u,v),(u¯,v¯)∈Rn×Rn, we have
 ∥F(t,u,v)−F(t,u¯,v¯)∥=∥v−v¯∥2+αt+γ(v¯−v)+(∇g(u¯)−∇g(u))2≤1+2αt+γ2∥v−v¯∥2+2Lg2∥u−u¯∥2≤1+2Lg2+2αt+γ2∥v−v¯∥2+∥u−u¯∥2=1+2Lg2+2αt+γ2∥(u,v)−(u¯,v¯)∥.  Obviously, the Lipschitz constant function t↦L(t):=1+2Lg2+2(α/t+γ)2 is continuous, hence integrable, on [t0,T] for all t0<T<+∞, consequently, L∈Lloc1([t0,+∞)).

Next we show that F(⋅,u,v)∈Lloc1([t0,+∞),Rn×Rn) for all u,v∈Rn. Let u,v∈Rn be fixed. For t0<T<+∞, one has
 ∫t0T∥F(t,u,v)∥dt=∫t0T∥v∥2+αt+γv+∇g(u)2dt≤∫t0T1+2αt+γ2∥v∥2+2∥∇g(u)∥2dt≤∥v∥2+∥∇g(u)∥2∫t0T3+2αt+γ2dt  and the conclusion follows by the continuity of t↦3+2(α/t+γ)2 on [t0,T].

The Cauchy–Lipschitz–Picard Theorem guarantees existence and uniqueness of the trajectory of the first-order dynamical system (6) and thus of the second-order dynamical system (2).

The next result shows that the acceleration of the trajectory generated by (2) is also locally absolutely continuous on [t0,+∞).

Proposition 2.1 For the starting points u0,v0∈Rn, let x be the unique strong global solution of (2). Then x¨ is locally absolutely continuous on [t0,+∞), hence the third-order derivative x(3) exists almost everywhere on [t0,+∞).

Proof. Let T>0 be fixed. According to Theorem 2.1, X(t):=(x(t),x˙(t)) is absolutely continuous on [t0,T]. We endow the product space Rn×Rn with the 1-norm. For arbitrary s,t∈[t0,T], we have
 ∥X˙(s)−X˙(t)∥1=∥F(s,X(s))−F(t,X(t))∥1=x˙(s)−x˙(t),−αs+γx˙(s)+αt+γx˙(t)−∇g(x(s))+∇g(x(t))1≤(1+γ)∥x˙(s)−x˙(t)∥+αsx˙(s)−αtx˙(t)+∥∇g(x(s))−∇g(x(t))∥≤(1+γ)∥x˙(s)−x˙(t)∥+|α|s∥x˙(s)−x˙(t)∥+αsx˙(t)−αtx˙(t)+Lg∥x(s)−x(t)∥≤L1∥x˙(s)−x˙(t)∥+L2αs−αt+Lg∥x(s)−x(t)∥,  where
 L1:=maxt∈[t0,T]1+γ+|α|tandL2:=maxt∈[t0,T]∥x˙(t)∥. 

Let be ε>0. Since the functions x˙(⋅),t↦α/t and x(⋅) are absolutely continuous on [t0,T], there exists η>0 such that for any finite family of intervals Ik=(ak,bk)⊆[t0,T], the implication
 Ik∩Ij=∅ and ∑k|bk−ak|<η⟹∑k∥x˙(bk)−x˙(ak)∥<ε3L1,∑kαbk−αak<ε3L2and∑k∥x(bk)−x(ak)∥<ε3Lg  holds. Consequently,
 ∑k∥X˙(ak)−X˙(bk)∥<ε3+ε3+ε3=ε,  hence X˙(⋅)=(x˙(⋅),x¨(⋅)) is absolutely continuous on [t0,T], which shows that x¨ is absolutely continuous [t0,T]. This proves that x¨ is locally absolutely continuous on [t0,+∞), which means that the third-order derivative x(3) exists almost everywhere on [t0,+∞).

The following results provides an estimate for the third-order derivative of the strong global solution of the dynamical system (2) in terms its first- and second-order derivatives.

Lemma 2.1 For the starting points u0,v0∈Rn, let x be the unique strong global solution of (2). Then, for almost every t∈[t0,+∞), it holds
 (7) ∥x(3)(t)∥≤Lg+|α|t2∥x˙(t)∥+γ+|α|t∥x¨(t)∥. 

Proof. Let t∈[t0,+∞) be such that X˙(t)=F(t,X(t)). We have for almost every h>0 that
 ∥X˙(t+h)−X˙(t)∥1=∥F(t+h,X(t+h))−F(t,X(t))∥1=x˙(t+h)−x˙(t),−αt+h+γx˙(t+h)+αt+γx˙(t)−∇g(x(t+h))+∇g(x(t))1=∥x˙(t+h)−x˙(t)∥+−αt+h+γx˙(t+h)+αt+γx˙(t)−∇g(x(t+h))+∇g(x(t))≤(1+γ)∥x˙(t+h)−x˙(t)∥+αt+hx˙(t+h)−αtx˙(t)+∥∇g(x(t+h))−∇g(x(t))∥≤(1+γ)∥x˙(t+h)−x˙(t)∥+αt+hx˙(t+h)−αtx˙(t)+Lg∥x(t+h)−x(t)∥.  Hence,
 X˙(t+h)−X˙(t)h1≤(1+γ)x˙(t+h)−x˙(t)h+(α/(t+h))x˙(t+h)−(α/t)x˙(t)h+Lgx(t+h)−x(t)h.  By taking the limit as h→0, we obtain
 ∥X¨(t)∥1≤(1+γ)∥x¨(t)∥+αtx˙(t)′+Lg∥x˙(t)∥.  Since ∥X¨(t)∥1=∥x(3)(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥, we conclude
 ∥x(3)(t)∥≤Lg+|α|t2∥x˙(t)∥+γ+|α|t∥x¨(t)∥. 

Remark 2.1 For
 N:=maxt≥t0Lg+|α|t2,γ+|α|t,  we have that
 ∥x(3)(t)∥≤N(∥x¨(t)∥+∥x˙(t)∥)  for almost every t∈[t0,+∞).

3. Convergence of trajectories
In this section, we study the convergence of the trajectory of the dynamical system (2). We denote by
 ω(x):={x¯∈Rn:∃tk⟶+∞ such that x(tk)⟶x¯ as k⟶+∞}  the set of limit points of the trajectory x.

Before proving a first result in this sense, we recall two technical lemmas which will play an essential role in the asymptotic analysis.

Lemma 3.1 Suppose that F:[0,+∞)→R is locally absolutely continuous and bounded below and that there exists G∈L1([0,+∞)) such that for almost every t∈[0,+∞)
 ddtF(t)≤G(t).  Then there exists limt→+∞F(t)∈R.

Lemma 3.2 Suppose that F:[0,+∞)→[0,+∞) is locally absolutely continuous and F∈Lp([0,+∞)),1≤p<∞, and that there exists G:[0,+∞)→R,G∈Lr([0,+∞)),1≤r≤∞, such that for almost every t∈[0,+∞)
 ddtF(t)≤G(t).  Then it holds limt→+∞F(t)=0.

Theorem 3.1 Assume that g is bounded from below and, for u0,v0∈Rn, let x be the unique strong global solution of the dynamical system (2). Then the following statements are true:
x˙,x¨∈L2([t0,+∞),Rn);

there exists β>0 such that the limit limt⟶+∞g(βa˙x(t)+x(t)) exists and is finite;

limt⟶+∞x¨(t)=0 and limt⟶+∞x˙(t)=0;

ω(x)⊆crit(g).



Proof. Choose 0<β<min(2/Lg,(Lg2+2γLg−Lg)/Lg). By using the Lg-Lipschitz continuity of ∇g, for almost every t∈[t0,+∞) it holds
 ddtg(βx˙(t)+x(t))=⟨βx¨(t)+x˙(t),∇g(βx˙(t)+x(t))⟩=⟨βx¨(t)+x˙(t),∇g(βx˙(t)+x(t))−∇g(x(t))⟩+βx¨(t)+x˙(t),−x¨(t)−αt+γx˙(t)≤−β∥x¨(t)∥2−1+βγ+αβt⟨x¨(t),x˙(t)⟩−γ+αt∥x˙(t)∥2+Lg∥βx¨(t)+x˙(t)∥∥βx˙(t)∥.  Taking into account that
 ∥βx¨(t)+x˙(t)∥∥βx˙(t)∥≤β2∥x¨(t)∥∥x˙(t)∥+β∥x˙(t)∥2≤12β2∥x¨(t)∥2+β+12β2∥x˙(t)∥2  and
 −1+βγ+αβt⟨x¨(t),x˙(t)⟩=−12ddt1+βγ+αβt∥x˙(t)∥2−αβ2t2∥x˙(t)∥2,  we obtain for almost every t∈[t0,+∞)
 (8) ddtg(βx˙(t)+x(t))+121+βγ+αβt∥x˙(t)∥2≤−β+Lgβ22∥x¨(t)∥2+−γ+Lgβ+Lgβ22−αt−αβ2t2∥x˙(t)∥2.  Since 0<β<min(2/Lg,(Lg2+2γLg−Lg)/Lg), there exists t1>0 such that for every t≥t1 it holds
 (9) 1+βγ+αβt>0,−β+Lgβ22<0and−γ+Lgβ+Lgβ22−αt−αβ2t2<0.  For simplicity, we denote
 A:=−β+Lgβ22andB(t):=−γ+Lgβ+Lgβ22−αt−αβ2t2∀t∈[t0,+∞). 

Let be T>t1. Since x∈C2([t1,T],Rn), we have x,x˙,x¨∈L2([t1,T],Rn). Furthermore, by the Lg-Lipschitz property of ∇g, it holds ∇g∈L2([t1,T],Rn). By integrating (8) on [t1,T], we obtain
 (10) g(βx˙(T)+x(T))+121+βγ+αβT∥x˙(T)∥2−∫t1TA∥x¨(t)∥2dt−∫t1TB(t)∥x˙(t)∥2dt≤g(βx˙(t1)+x(t1))+121+βγ+αβt1∥x˙(t1)∥2.  Taking into account that g is bounded from bellow, by letting T⟶+∞, we obtain
 ∫t1∞(−A∥x¨(t)∥2)dt<+∞and∫t1∞(−B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2)dt<+∞  Consequently ∥x¨(⋅)∥2,B(⋅)∥x˙(⋅)∥2∈L1([t0,+∞),R), hence
 x¨,x˙∈L2([t0,+∞),Rn).  On the other hand, (8) and Lemma 3.1 ensure that the limit
 (11) limt⟶+∞g(βx˙(t)+x(t))+121+βγ+αβt∥x˙(t)∥2  exists and is finite.

As for almost every t∈[t0,+∞)
 ddt(∥x˙(t)∥2)=2⟨x¨(t),x˙(t)⟩≤∥x˙(t)∥2+∥x¨(t)∥2  and ∥x˙(⋅)∥2+∥x¨(⋅)∥2∈L1([t0,+∞)), according to Lemma 3.2, it follows that limt⟶+∞x˙(t)=0.

As for almost every t∈[t0,+∞)
 ddt(∥x¨(t)∥2)=2⟨x(3)(t),x¨(t)⟩≤∥x(3)(t)∥2+∥x¨(t)∥2  and ∥x(3)(⋅)∥2+∥x¨(⋅)∥2∈L1([t0,+∞)) (see Remark 2.1 and (i)), according to Lemma 3.2, it follows that limt⟶+∞x¨(t)=0.

Finally, by using that limt⟶+∞x˙(t)=0, (11) becomes
 (12) ∃limt⟶+∞g(βx˙(t)+x(t))+121+βγ+αβt∥x˙(t)∥2=limt⟶+∞g(βx˙(t)+x(t))∈R. 

Let x¯∈ω(x). Then there exists a sequence tk⟶+∞,k⟶+∞ such that x(tk)⟶x¯ as k⟶+∞. By using the continuity of ∇g, we have
 0=limk⟶+∞x¨(tk)+αtk+γx˙(tk)+∇g(x(tk))=∇g(x¯),  which shows that x¯∈crit(g).

In the following result, we use the distance function to a set, defined for A⊆Rn as dist(x,A)=infy∈A∥x−y∥ for all x∈Rn. The following result is a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1.

Lemma 3.3 Assume that g is bounded from below and, for u0,v0∈Rn, let x be the unique strong global solution of the dynamical system (2). Define
 H:Rn×Rn⟶R,H(x,y)=g(x)+12∥x−y∥2.  Let be 0<β<min(2/Lg,(Lg2+2γLg−Lg)/Lg) and t1>0 such that for every t≥t1 the inequalities (9) hold. For every t∈[t1,+∞), define
 u(t):=βx˙(t)+x(t),v(t):=1+βγ+αβt+βx˙(t)+x(t),A=−β+Lgβ22,B(t):=−γ+Lgβ+Lgβ22−αt−αβ2t2andp(t):=Lgβ+γ+|α|t+21+βγ+αβt.  Then the following statements are true:
ω(u)=ω(v)=ω(x);

ddtH(u(t),v(t))≤A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2≤0 for almost every t≥t1;

the limit limt⟶+∞H(u(t),v(t))=limt⟶+∞g(βa˙x(t)+x(t)) exists and is finite;

H is finite and constant on ω(u,v)={(x¯,x¯)∈Rn×Rn:x¯∈ω(x)};

∥∇H(u(t),v(t))∥≤∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥ for almost every t≥t1;

ω(u,v)⊆crit(H).


If x is bounded, then
ω(u,v) is nonempty and compact;

limt⟶+∞dist((u(t),v(t)),ω(u,v))=0.



Proof. (i) According to Theorem 3.1(iii),
 limt⟶+∞βx˙(t)=limt⟶+∞1+βγ+αβt+βx˙(t)=0,  hence ω(u)=ω(v)=ω(x).

(ii) and (iii) are nothing else than (8) and (12), respectively.

(iv) follows directly from (iii).

(v) Since ∇H(x,y)=(∇g(x)+x−y,y−x) for every (x,y)∈Rn×Rn, by using (2), we have for almost every t∈[t1,+∞)
 ∥∇H(u(t),v(t))∥≤∥∇g(u(t))∥+2∥u(t)−v(t)∥≤∥∇g(u(t))−∇g(x(t))∥+∥∇g(x(t))∥+2∥u(t)−v(t)∥≤Lgβ∥x˙(t)∥+−x¨(t)−γ+αtx˙(t)+2∥u(t)−v(t)∥≤∥x¨(t)∥+Lgβ+γ+|α|t+21+βγ+αβt∥x˙(t)∥=∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥. 

(vi) Since
 critH={(x,y)∈Rn×Rn:∇H(x,y)=(0,0)}={(x¯,x¯)∈Rn×Rn:x¯∈crit(g)}  and (see (i))
 ω(u,v)={(x¯,x¯)∈Rn×Rn:x¯∈ω(x)},  by Theorem 3.1(iv) one obtains
 ω(u,v)⊆crit(H). 

Assume that x is bounded.

(vii) Since x˙(t)⟶0,t⟶+∞, we obtain that u and v are bounded, too. Thus, the set of limit points ω(u,v) is nonempty. Furthermore, since ω(u,v)={(x¯,x¯)∈Rn×Rn:x¯∈ω(x)} and ω(x) is bounded, it is enough to show that ω(x) is closed.

Let be (x¯n)n≥1⊆ω(x) and assume that limn⟶+∞x¯n=x∗. We show that x∗∈ω(x). Obviously, for every n≥1, there exists a sequence tkn⟶+∞,k⟶+∞, such that
 limk⟶+∞x(tkn)=x¯n. 

Let be ϵ>0. Since limn⟶+∞x¯n=x∗, there exists N(ϵ)∈N such that for every n≥N(ϵ) it holds
 ∥x¯n−x∗∥<ϵ2.  Let n≥1 be fixed. Since limk⟶+∞x(tkn)=x¯n, there exists k(n,ϵ)∈N such that for every k≥k(n,ϵ) it holds
 ∥x(tkn)−x¯n∥<ϵ2.  Let be kn≥k(n,ε) such that tknn>n. Obviously tknn⟶∞ as n⟶+∞ and for every n≥N(ϵ)
 ∥x(tknn)−x∗∥<ϵ.  Hence,
 limn⟶+∞x(tknn)=x∗,  thus x∗∈ω(x).

(viii) follows from the definition of the set ω(u,v).

Remark 3.1 Combining (iii) and (iv) in Lemma 3.3, it follows that for every x¯∈ω(x) and tk⟶+∞ such that x(tk)⟶x¯ as k⟶+∞ we have
 limk⟶+∞H(u(tk),v(tk))=H(x¯,x¯). 

The convergence of the trajectory generated by the dynamical system (2) will be shown in the framework of functions satisfying the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. For η∈(0,+∞], we denote by Θη the class of concave and continuous functions ϕ:[0,η)→[0,+∞) such that ϕ(0)=0, ϕ is continuously differentiable on (0,η), continuous at 0 and ϕ′(s)>0 for all
s∈(0,η).

Definition 3.1 Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property
Let f:Rn→R be a differentiable function. We say that f satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) property at x¯∈Rn if there exist η∈(0,+∞], a neighbourhood U of x¯ and a function ϕ∈Θη such that for all x in the intersection
 U∩{x∈Rn:f(x¯)<f(x)<f(x¯)+η},  the following inequality holds
 ϕ′(f(x)−f(x¯))∥∇f(x))∥≥1.  If f satisfies the KL property at each point in Rn, then f is called a KL function.

The origins of this notion go back to the pioneering work of Łojasiewicz [19], where it is proved that for a real-analytic function f:Rn→R and a critical point x¯∈Rn (that is ∇f(x¯)=0), there exists θ∈[1/2,1) such that the function |f−f(x¯)|θ∥∇f∥−1 is bounded around x¯. This corresponds to the situation when ϕ(s)=C(1−θ)−1s1−θ. The result of Łojasiewicz allows the interpretation of the KL property as a re-parametrization of the function values in order to avoid flatness around the critical points. Kurdyka [20] extended this property to differentiable functions definable in an o-minimal structure. Further extensions to the nonsmooth setting can be found in [21–24].

To the class of KL functions belong semi-algebraic, real sub-analytic, semiconvex, uniformly convex and convex functions satisfying a growth condition. We refer the reader to [21–27] and the references therein for more details regarding all the classes mentioned above and illustrating examples.

An important role in our convergence analysis will be played by the following uniformized KL property given in [27, Lemma 6].

Lemma 3.4 Let Ω⊆Rn be a compact set and let f:Rn→R be a differentiable function. Assume that f is constant on Ω and f satisfies the KL property at each point of Ω. Then there exist ϵ,η>0 and ϕ∈Θη such that for all x¯∈Ω and for all x in the intersection
 (13) {x∈Rn:dist(x,Ω)<ε}∩{x∈Rn:f(x¯)<f(x)<f(x¯)+η},  the following inequality holds
 (14) ϕ′(f(x)−f(x¯))∥∇f(x)∥≥1. 

The following theorem is the main result of the paper and concerns the global asymptotic convergence of the trajectory generated by (2).

Theorem 3.2 Assume that g is bounded from below and, for u0,v0∈Rn, let x be the unique strong global solution of (2). Suppose that
 H:Rn×Rn⟶R,H(x,y)=g(x)+12∥x−y∥2  is a KL function and x is bounded. Then the following statements are true:
x˙,x¨∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn);

there exists x¯∈crit(g) such that limt⟶+∞x(t)=x¯.



Proof. Let be 0<β<min(2/Lg,(Lg2+2γLg−Lg)/Lg) and t1>0 such that for every t≥t1 the inequalities (9) hold. Furthermore, we will use the notations made in Lemma 3.3, according to which we can choose (x~,x~)∈ω(u,v). It holds
 limt⟶+∞H(u(t),v(t))=H(x~,x~). 

Case I. There exists t¯≥t1 such that H(u(t¯),v(t¯))=H(x~,x~). From Lemma 3.3(ii), we have
 ddtH(u(t),v(t))≤A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2≤0 for almost every t≥t1,  hence
 H(u(t),v(t))≤H(x~,x~) for every t≥t¯.  On the other hand,
 H(u(t),v(t))≥limt⟶+∞H(u(t),v(t))=H(x~,x~) for every t≥t1,  hence
 H(u(t),v(t))=H(x~,x~) for every t≥t¯.  Hence, (d/dt)H(u(t),v(t))=0, which leads to
 0≤A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2≤0 for almost every t≥t¯.  Since A<0 and B(t)<0 for every t≥t1, the latter inequality can hold only if
 x˙(t)=x¨(t)=0 for almost every t≥t¯.  Consequently, x˙,x¨∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn) and x is constant on [t¯,+∞).

Case II. We assume that H(u(t),v(t))>H(x~,x~) holds for every t≥t1. Let Ω:=ω(u,v). According to Lemma 3.3, Ω is nonempty and compact and H is constant on Ω. Since H is a KL function, according to Lemma 3.4, there exist ε,η>0 and ϕ∈Θη such that for every (z~,w~) in the intersection
 {(z,w)∈Rn×Rn:dist((z,w),Ω)<ε}∩{(z,w)∈Rn×Rn:H(x¯,x¯)<H(z,w)<H(x~,x~)+η}  one has
 ϕ′(H(z~,w~)−H(x~,x~))∥∇H(z~,w~)∥≥1. 

Since limt⟶+∞dist(u(t),v(t),Ω)=0, there exists t2≥t1 such that dist(u(t),v(t)),Ω)<ϵ for every t≥t2. Since limt⟶+∞H(u(t),v(t))=H(x¯,x¯), there exists t3≥t1 such that H(x¯,x¯)<H(u(t),v(t))<H(x¯,x¯)+η for every t≥t3. Hence, for every t≥T:=max(t2,t3), we have
 ϕ′(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x¯,x¯))⋅∥∇H(u(t),v(t))∥≥1. 

According to Lemma 3.3 (ii) and (v), we have (d/dt)H(u(t),v(t))≤A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2≤0 and ∥∇H(u(t),v(t))∥≤∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥, hence
 ddtϕ(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x~,x~))=ϕ′(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x~,x~))ddtH(u(t),v(t))≤A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥  for almost every t∈[T,+∞).

By integrating on the interval [T,T¯], for T¯>T, we obtain
 ϕ(H(u(T¯),v(T¯))−H(x~,x~))−∫TT¯A∥x¨(s)∥2+B(s)∥x˙(s)∥2∥x¨(s)∥+p(s)∥x˙(s)∥ds≤ϕ(H(u(T),v(T))−H(x~,x~)). 

Since ϕ is bounded from below, A<0,B(s)<0 and p(s)>0 for every s≥T and T¯ was arbitrarily chosen, we obtain that
 0≤∫T+∞−A∥x¨(s)∥2−B(s)∥x˙(s)∥2∥x¨(s)∥+p(s)∥x˙(s)∥ds≤ϕ(H(u(T),v(T))−H(x¯,x¯)),  which leads to
 t↦∥x¨(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥,t↦∥x˙(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn)  and further to
 t↦∥x¨(t)∥∥x˙(t)∥∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn).  Since p is bounded from above on [t0,+∞) and
 ∥x˙(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥=∥x¨(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥+(1+p(t))∥x¨(t)∥∥x˙(t)∥∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥,  we obtain that
 x˙,x¨∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn). 

Finally, since x˙∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn), the limit limt⟶+∞x(t) exists and it is finite. In conclusion, there exists x¯∈crit(g) such that
 limt⟶+∞x(t)=x¯. 

Remark 3.2 According to Remark 2.1, there exists N>0 such that ∥x(3)(t)∥≤N(∥x¨(t)∥+∥x˙(t)∥) for almost every t≥t0, hence, under the hypotheses of Theorem 3.2, one has
 x(3)∈L1([t0,+∞),Rn). 

Remark 3.3 Since the class of semi-algebraic functions is closed under addition [see, for example, [27]] and (x,y)↦12∥x−y∥2 is semi-algebraic, the conclusion of the previous theorem holds, if, instead of asking that H is a KL function, we ask that g is semi-algebraic.

Remark 3.4 Assume that g is coercive, that is
 lim∥u∥→+∞g(u)=+∞.  For u0,v0∈Rn, let x∈C2([0,+∞),Rn) be the unique global solution of (2). Then x is bounded.

Indeed, notice that g is bounded from below, being a continuous and coercive function [see [28]]. From (10), it follows that βx˙(T)+x(T) is contained for every T≥t1 in a lower level set of g, which is bounded. According to Theorem 3.1, βx˙(t)⟶0,t⟶+∞, which implies that x is bounded.

4. Convergence rates
In this section, we will assume that the regularized function H satisfies the Lojasiewicz property, which, as noted in the previous section, corresponds to a particular choice of the desingularizing function ϕ [see [19,22,25]].

Definition 4.1 Let f:Rn⟶R be a differentiable function. The function f is said to fulfil the Łojasiewicz property, if for every x¯∈critf there exist K,ϵ>0 and θ∈(0,1) such that
 |f(x)−f(x¯)|θ≤K∥∇f(x)∥ for every x fulfilling ∥x−x¯∥<ϵ.  The number θ is called the Łojasiewicz exponent of f at the critical point x¯.

In the following theorem, we provide convergence rates for the trajectory generated by (2), its velocity and acceleration in terms of the Łojasiewicz exponent of H [see, also, [22,25]].

Theorem 4.1 Assume that g is bounded from below and, for u0,v0∈Rn, let x be the unique strong global solution of (2). Suppose that x is bounded, let x¯∈crit(g) be such that limt⟶+∞x(t)=x¯ and suppose that
 H:Rn×Rn⟶R,H(x,y)=g(x)+12∥x−y∥2 
fulfils the Łojasiewicz property at (x¯,x¯)∈critH with Łojasiewicz exponent θ. Let be (see Remark 2.1)
 N:=maxt≥t0Lg+|α|t2,γ+|α|t.  Then, there exist a1,a2,a3,a4>0 and T>0 such that for almost every t∈[T,+∞), the following statements are true:
if θ∈(0,12), then x converges in finite time;

if θ=12, then ∥x(t)−x¯∥≤a1e−a2t,
∥x˙(t)∥≤a1e−a2t and ∥x¨(t)∥≤Na1e−a2t;

if θ∈(12,1), then ∥x(t)−x¯∥≤(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1),
∥x˙(t)∥≤(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1) and ∥x¨(t)∥≤N(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1).



Proof. Let be 0<β<min(2/Lg,(Lg2+2γLg−Lg)/Lg) and t1>0 such that for every t≥t1 the inequalities (9) hold. We define for every t∈[t1,+∞)
 σ(t):=∫t+∞(∥x˙(s)∥+∥x¨(s)∥)ds.  Let t∈[t1,+∞) be fixed. For T≥t, we have
 ∥x(t)−x¯∥=x(T)−x¯−∫tTx˙(s)ds≤∥x(T)−x¯∥+∫tT∥x˙(s)∥ds.  By taking the limit as T⟶+∞, we obtain
 (15) ∥x(t)−x¯∥≤∫t+∞∥x˙(s)∥ds≤σ(t). 

Furthermore, for T>t, we have
 ∥x˙(t)∥=x˙(T)−∫tTx¨(s)ds≤∥x˙(T)∥+∫tT∥x¨(s)∥ds.  By taking the limit as T⟶+∞, we obtain
 (16) ∥x˙(t)∥≤∫t+∞∥x¨(s)∥ds≤σ(t). 

According to Remark 2.1, it holds ∥x(3)(t)∥≤N(∥x¨(t)∥+∥x˙(t)∥) for almost every t≥t1,
 ∥x¨(t)∥=x¨(T)−∫tTx(3)(s)ds≤∥x¨(T)∥+∫tT∥x(3)(s)∥ds≤∥x¨(T)∥+N∫tT(∥x¨(s)∥+∥x˙(s)∥)ds∀T>t.  By taking the limit as T⟶+∞, we obtain
 (17) ∥x¨(t)∥≤Nσ(t).  Next, we show that there exists m<0 such that
 (18) A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥≤m(∥x˙(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥). 

Indeed,
 (∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥)(∥x˙(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥)=∥x¨(t)∥2+(1+p(t))∥x˙(t)∥∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥2≤32+p(t)2∥x¨(t)∥2+12+3p(t)2∥x˙(t)∥2≤Am∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)m∥x˙(t)∥2,  where
 m:=maxmaxt≥t1A3/2+p(t)/2,maxt≥t1B(t)(3/2)p(t)+1/2.  It is an easy verification that m<0.

As we have seen in the proof of Theorem 3.2, if there exists t¯≥t1 such that H(u(t¯),v(t¯))=H(x¯,x¯), then x is constant on [t¯,+∞) and the conclusion follows.

On the other hand, if for every t≥t1 one has that H(u(t),v(t))>H(x¯,x¯), then according to the proof of Theorem 3.2, there exist ϵ>0 and T≥t1 such that
 ∥(u(t),v(t))−(x¯,x¯)∥<ϵ  and
 ddt(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x¯,x¯))1−θ≤A∥x¨(t)∥2+B(t)∥x˙(t)∥2∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥ for almost every t≥T.  Busing (18), we obtain that
 M(∥x˙(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥)+ddt(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x¯,x¯))1−θ≤0 for almost every t≥T,  where M:=−m>0.

For t≥T, we integrate the last relation on the interval [t,T~], where T~>t, which yields
 M∫tT~(∥x˙(s)∥+∥x¨(s)∥)ds+(H(u(T~),v(T~))−H(x¯,x¯))1−θ≤(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x¯,x¯))1−θ.  By taking the limits as T~⟶+∞, we get
 Mσ(t)≤(H(u(t),v(t))−H(x¯,x¯))1−θ.  On the other hand, according to the KL property for H and Lemma 3.3 (v), we have
 (H(u(t),v(t))−H(x¯,x¯))θ≤K∥∇H(u(t),v(t))∥≤K(∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥) for almost every t≥T,  hence
 Mσ(t)≤K(1−θ)/θ(∥x¨(t)∥+p(t)∥x˙(t)∥)(1−θ)/θ for almost every t≥T.  By denoting a:=maxt≥Tp(t)∈(0,+∞), one can easily see that a>1 and so
 Mσ(t)≤(aK)(1−θ)/θ(∥x˙(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥)(1−θ)/θ for almost every t≥T.  Taking into account that ∥x˙(t)∥+∥x¨(t)∥=−σ˙(t), the previous inequality is nothing else than
 (19) −cσθ/(1−θ)(t)≥σ˙(t) for almost every t≥T,  where c:=Mθ/(1−θ)/aK>0.

If θ=12, then (19) becomes cσ(t)+σ˙(t)≤0 for almost every t≥T. By multiplying with ect and integrating on [T,t], it follows that there exists a1>0 such that
 σ(t)≤a1e−a2t for every t≥T,  where a2=c. Using (15)–(17), we obtain
 ∥x(t)−x¯∥≤a1e−a2t,∥x˙(t)∥≤a1e−a2tand∥x¨(t)∥≤Na1e−a2t for every t≥T,  which proves (b).

Assume now that 0<θ<12. In this case, (19) leads to
 ddtσ(1−2θ)/(1−θ)(t)=1−2θ1−θσ−θ/(1−θ)(t)σ˙(t)≤−c1−2θ1−θ for almost every t≥T.  By integrating on [T,t] we obtain
 σ(1−2θ)/(1−θ)(t)≤−α¯t+β¯, for every t≥T,  where α¯>0. Then there exists Tˆ≥T such that σ(t)≤0 for every t≥Tˆ, thus, x is constant on [Tˆ,+∞) and (a) follows.

Assume now that 12<θ<1. In this case, (19) leads to
 ddtσ(1−2θ)/(1−θ)(t)=1−2θ1−θσ−θ/(1−θ)(t)σ˙(t)≥c2θ−11−θ for almost every t≥T.  By integrating on [T,t] we obtain
 σ(1−2θ)/(1−θ)(t)≥a3t+a4 for every t≥T,  where a3,a4>0, or, equivalently,
 σ(t)≤(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1) for every t≥T.  Using again (15)–(17), we obtain
 ∥x(t)−x¯∥≤(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1),∥x˙(t)∥≤(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1)and∥x¨(t)∥≤N(a3t+a4)−(1−θ)/(2θ−1) for every t≥T,  which proves (c).
