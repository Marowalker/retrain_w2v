A systematic
saturation mutagenesis campaign was carried out on
an alkene reductase from Pichia stipitis (OYE 2.6) to develop variants with reversed stereoselectivities.
Wild-type OYE 2.6 reduces three representative Baylis–Hillman
adducts to the corresponding S products with almost
complete stereoselectivities and good catalytic efficiencies. We created
and screened 13 first-generation, site-saturation mutagenesis libraries,
targeting residues found near the bound substrate. One variant (Tyr78Trp)
showed high R selectivity
toward one of the three substrates, but no change (cyclohexenone derivative)
and no catalytic activity (acrylate derivative) for the other two.
Subsequent rounds of mutagenesis retained the Tyr78Trp mutation and
explored other residues that impacted stereoselectivity when altered
in a wild-type background. These efforts yielded double and triple
mutants that possessed inverted stereoselectivities for two of the
three substrates (conversions >99% and at least 91% ee (R)). To understand the reasons underlying the stereochemical
changes,
we solved crystal structures of two key mutants: Tyr78Trp and Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys,
the latter with substrate partially occupying the active site. By
combining these experimental data with modeling studies, we have proposed
a rationale that explains the impacts of the most useful mutations.

Introduction
Alkene reductase enzymes
have become increasingly popular biocatalysts
for converting prochiral substrates into optically pure building blocks.1 Flavoproteins of the Old Yellow Enzyme superfamily
are particularly useful for this purpose, and a variety of homologues
have been studied since the seminal work by Massey on Saccharomyces pastorianus OYE 12.3 Although S.
pastorianus OYE 1 and its homologues often show very
high stereoselectivities toward many substrates, natural enzymes are
practically available only in a single enantiomeric form. This means
that only one product enantiomer is readily available. Bioprospecting
for stereocomplementary OYE 1 homologues has been successful for a
few specific substrate/enzyme pairs,4 but
no generally applicable solution has been identified. Protein engineering
is an attractive alternative, and previous success by our group5 and others1k,6 has suggested that this
strategy might prove fruitful. One major concern with such projects,
however, is that the evolutionary pathway may be highly substrate-specific,
and it can be difficult to follow a path that encounters a dead end
at an intermediate point.7

We chose Pichia stipitis OYE 2.6
as the starting point for these studies because the wild-type enzyme
shows higher stability under process conditions than S. pastorianus OYE 1.8 Moreover, the native enzyme shows very high stereoselectivities
toward a series of Baylis–Hillman adducts whose reductions
yield useful synthetic building blocks.9 The major drawback of OYE 2.6 is that it provides only one of the
two enantiomers of these products. In addition to addressing this
practical problem, our larger goal in this study was to discover key
structure–function relationships in OYE 2.6 in particular and
within the OYE superfamily in general.

In principle, there are
two strategies that can be used to alter
the enantioselectivity of an alkene reductase: move the substrate
to the opposite side of the FMN cofactor (and provide a new general
acid for α-carbon protonation) or flip the orientation of substrate
binding within the existing active site. Because only one face of
the FMN is accessible within the protein environment, moving the substrate
binding site to the opposite side of the cofactor appeared impractical.
We therefore concentrated on changing the substrate binding orientation
by altering residues that directly or indirectly contacted the alkene.
Our strategy was inspired by the iterative saturation mutagenesis
approach of the Reetz group (for recent examples, see ref (10) and references therein),
in which the “best” single mutants from first-round
site-saturation libraries serve as the basis for subsequent site-saturation
mutagenesis libraries at other key positions (also identified within
the same collection of first-generation libraries). The key problem
in alkene reductase engineering is to identify those residues that
control substrate binding orientation with as little effort as possible.
This is one issue that we hoped to address for this class of enzymes
in the present study.

To avoid becoming trapped within local
sequence space minima during
directed evolution and to provide more generally useful structure–function
correlations, we carried out three parallel studies. Each focused
on a different alkene substrate (Figure 1).
Wild-type OYE 2.6 reduces Baylis–Hillman adducts 1 and 3 to the corresponding S products
with very high enantioselectivities and good rates. It also converts
cyclopentenone 2 to the S product in
76% ee.11 Unfortunately, no synthetically
useful, complementary R-selective alkene reductase
with good catalytic efficiency has been identified for these substrates.
The only exception was wild-type S. pastorianus OYE 1, which reduces Roche ester precursor 3 to the R product with >98% ee; however, the conversion rate
is
too low to be practically useful.9 Our
goal was therefore to evolve R-selective, enantiocomplementary
catalysts for 1–3, starting from
wild-type OYE 2.6.

study.

Results and Discussion
Residue Selection
In the high-resolution OYE 2.6/p-chlorophenol complex
(PDB code 4DF2),11 the phenolic
oxygen lies between the side chains of His188 and His191. On the basis
of our earlier experience with S. pastorianus OYE 1,9 this is also the likely position
of the substrate carbonyl oxygen in electron-deficient, conjugated
alkenes (Figure 2). The α- and β-carbons
of the conjugated system can likewise be inferred from the positions
of carbon atoms in the p-chlorophenol ring. On the
basis of this presumed substrate binding mode, we sought residues
that might control the stereoselectivity of OYE 2.6 by direct interactions
with the substrate. Our selections were guided by three criteria.
First, we only considered residues lying above the si face of the flavin since the cofactor’s re face is shielded by the protein interior. In addition, we also concentrated
on residues whose side chains were oriented toward the center of the
active site. Finally, we selected only residues whose distances from
the likely locations of bound substrates made direct interactions
plausible.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the OYE 2.6 active site and residues targeted
for site-saturation mutagenesis. In this view, the FMN lies beneath
the substrate analogue (p-chlorophenol). Distances
between the Cβ atom of selected
side chains and the center of the aromatic ring of the inhibitor were
determined from the X-ray crystal structure of OYE 2.6 and the centers
of the boxes depicting the residues correspond to this distance. For
reference, circles of 5 and 10 Å are shown in dotted lines. The
heavy line linking Gly292, Asn293, and Val294 indicates the loop connecting
these residues. Residues shown in gray type were not included in the
site-saturation libraries (Leu115, Tyr193, and Gln248). Residues whose
boxes are gray yielded no improved variants in site-saturation libraries
when tested against the three substrates examined in this study.

Once the initial list of candidates
that fulfilled all three criteria
had been generated, we measured the distance from the residue’s Cβ to the nearest atom of the bound inhibitor;
the results are shown schematically in Figure 2. Those residues with Cβ/inhibitor
distances of ≤5 Å were predicted to have high probabilities
of interacting directly with bound substrates (and therefore impacting
stereoselectivity). Those with distances between 5 and 10 Å were
judged somewhat less likely to impact substrate binding. These efforts
yielded a group of 14 residues considered as candidates for site-saturation
mutagenesis.12 Of these, two were subsequently
eliminated because their side chains were partially masked by adjacent
active site residues (Leu115 and Gln248).

One of the most significant
differences between the structures
of OYE 2.6 and S. pastorianus OYE 1
occurs in a loop region centered on Pro295 (OYE 1 numbering). This
loop is shorter by several residues in OYE 2.6, which lacks a direct
counterpart to Pro295. This allows the side chain at position 292
to project into the active site, and this residue was therefore added
to our group of candidates.13 Finally,
in OYE 2.6, the side chain of Tyr78 shifts position upon p-chlorophenol binding. This alternate conformation would place its Cβ significantly closer to a bound substrate,
and we therefore included it in our group of mutagenesis candidates.

First-Generation Libraries
This project involved three
parallel directed evolution studies, and each sample required individual
chiral-phase GC analysis (∼15 min/sample). Compact and complete
site-saturation libraries devoid of artifacts were therefore essential
to avoid unnecessary additional screening efforts. We used a rolling
circle methodology to prepare site-saturation libraries at each of
the 13 selected positions using an NNK degeneracy scheme.14 This approach afforded a high probability of
sampling all 20 amino acids in a library contained on a single 96-well
plate. Library creation was optimized in a previous study to maximize
diversity at the targeted position, minimize wild-type carryover,
and eliminate primer concatamers15.16 All pooled libraries were analyzed quantitatively
after the initial transformation step by fluorescence sequencing to
assess diversity at the randomized positions (Table 1). The Qpool value indicates the
base composition at all targeted positions within a given library
(0.0 = no diversity; 1.0 = perfect randomization).15 In our experience, libraries with Qpool values ≥0.70 likely contained at least 17 of the
20 amino acids within a 95-member collection. In some cases, individual
library members were sequenced prior to screening to verify the relationship
between Qpool values and amino acid content.
This also allowed a single example of each codon to be preselected
prior to screening, which decreased the number of mutants to 32 (or
fewer if a given codon was absent from a library).

a Qpool values indicate nucleotide diversity across all three
bases of the
targeted codon (0.0 = single base present, 1.0 = all relevant nucleotides
present at equal levels). Values were calculated from fluorescence
sequencing data as described in ref (15). Codons were randomized by an NNK doping scheme
that encodes all 20 amino acids. Libraries with Qpool ≥ 0.75 likely contain at least 15 of the 20
possible amino acids at the indicated position and were considered
acceptable for screening experiments.

b From ref (11).

c Codons absent from this
library
were subsequently added individually to achieve complete sequence
space coverage.

Individual
clones were grown in 96-deepwell plates under autoinducing
conditions, then cell pellets were harvested and used for whole-cell
alkene reductions under nongrowing conditions. For libraries sequenced
prior to screening, one example of each codon was assayed;17 when individual sequences were unknown, we assessed
95 randomly chosen mutants along with a wild-type control. Reaction
mixtures were extracted, and the extents of conversion and product
optical purities were determined by chiral-phase GC. Clones showing
improved properties were sequenced (if necessary) to determine the
amino acid replacement responsible. In all cases, mutations were confined
to the targeted positions, and no spurious changes were detected.

Our previous studies had shown that altering Thr35, His188, or
His191 did not significantly change the facial selectivity of alkene
binding within the OYE 2.6 active site.11 This was also the case for Phe37, Ala68, Gly292, Asn293, Phe373,
and Tyr374 (some or all of the mutants at these positions had lower
percent conversion values, but all those retaining activity showed
essentially unchanged S stereoselectivity for 1–3) (Figure 2).
Clearly, despite their proximity to the bound substrate, these residues—when
altered singly—do not strongly impact substrate binding.

A handful of single-site changes did impact the
orientation of substrate binding in OYE 2.6. Changing Val294 to Pro
somewhat diminished the enzyme’s S selectivity
toward cyclohexenone 1 (from 95% to 61% ee, S), although this was accompanied by relatively poor conversion (∼10%).
No other variant at position 294 showed any change in stereoselectivity
toward 1. Moreover, the Val294Pro mutant (along with
all other Val294 replacements) reduced alkenes 2 and 3 with the same stereoselectivity as wild-type OYE 2.6. These
results provided the first evidence that changes to the OYE 2.6 active
site did not affect binding of the three homologous substrates equally.
They also showed that proximity to the bound substrate was not the
sole determinant of importance with respect to stereoselectivity

Substituting either Tyr or Trp for Phe247 decreased S selectivity for cyclopentenone 2 by a small amount
without harming conversion. Other amino acid changes at this position
were ineffective for 2, and no alterations were identified
that altered the stereochemistry of reduction for substrates 1 and 3.

By contrast, changes at Ile113
altered the stereochemistry of alkene
reductions more significantly. Ile113 in OYE 2.6 corresponds to Trp116
in S. pastorianus OYE 1, and our previous
experience with Trp116 in OYE 1 underscored the dramatic effect of
changes at this active site location.9,18 In the case
of OYE 2.6, the impacts were more subtle: the Asp mutant showed a
significant decrease in stereoselectivity toward cyclohexenone 1 (but not toward alkenes 2 or 3), whereas substituting Ile113 with Trp gave slight R selectivity for 2 (but unchanged stereoselectivity
for 1 and 3). Unfortunately, the enhanced R selectivity came at the cost of poor conversion efficiency
(Figure 3A).

libraries. (A) Ile113

could not be determined accurately because of the low conversion levels.

could not be determined accurately because of the low conversion levels.
The data point for one key variant (Trp) is highlighted.

Replacing Tyr78 with Trp caused the largest alteration
in OYE 2.6’s
stereoselectivity by a single amino acid change. This substitution
reversed the enzyme’s stereoselectivity toward cyclopentenone 2 (from >99% ee (S) to 63% ee (R)) while still retaining good catalytic efficiency. Interestingly,
this phenomenon was restricted to Trp, and no other amino acid replacement
showed similar effects (Figure 3B).19 Moreover, although the Tyr78Trp mutant also
reduced cyclohexenone 1 with high efficiency (>99%
conversion
after 24 h), its stereoselectivity toward this substrate was unchanged
(>98% ee (S)). Finally, it was important to note
that this mutant was ineffective at reducing Roche ester precursor 3.

Three major themes emerged from our first-round site-saturation
libraries. First, side chain proximity to the bound substrate, although
relevant, was not a perfect predictor of control over substrate binding
orientation. Of the 13 targeted positions, only four—Tyr78,
Ile113, Phe247, and Val294—actually impacted stereoselectivities
upon mutation. A second, unexpected lesson was that the changes in
stereoselectivity provoked by mutagenesis were not consistent, even
among structurally similar substrates. Indeed, the most interesting
mutant, Tyr78Trp, showed significant R stereoselectivity
and high activity toward cyclopentenone 2, but no change
for 1 and no catalytic activity whatsoever for 3. It is also important to note that none of the three
substrates, if tested alone, would have uncovered all four improved
OYE 2.6 variants.

Crystal Structure of the Tyr78Trp Mutant
We solved
the Tyr78Trp OYE 2.6 crystal structure to understand why this mutation
almost completely reversed the enzyme’s enantioselectivity
toward alkene 2 (Table 2). Trp
substitution did not appreciably change the overall protein structure,
and its indole ring lay in approximately the same plane as the phenol
moiety of the wild type Tyr at this position (Figure 4). Nearby neighbors included the side chains of Leu115, Ala68,
Phe70, and Ile113. A Trp at position 78 adds to the existing hydrophobic
character of this pocket, and the decreased polarity of this active
site region may be one factor that influences the orientation of substrate
binding by discouraging the polar hydroxymethyl side chain of alkene 2 from binding in this region.

Beyond
polarity, we also identified another, more direct impact
of Trp substitution on the facial selectivity of substrate binding:
an indole side chain at position 78 will sterically interfere with
the hydroxyl side chain of alkene 2 and thereby prevent
it from occupying this location in the “normal” binding
mode. In wild-type OYE 2.6, an ordered solvent molecule (WAT 611)
is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Tyr7811 (Figure 4). Modeling suggested that this
water was replaced by the substrate hydroxyl group upon binding of
Baylis–Hillman substrates. No ordered solvent molecule corresponding
to WAT 611 was observed in the Tyr78Trp variant, and it would be impossible
to place a water at the same position in the mutant because the closest
approach distance would be only 1.8 Å. This implies that alkene 2 would be unable to place its side chain hydroxyl group at
an analogous position. The most logical alternative would be a “flipped”
binding mode that places the substrate side chain on the other side
of the active site. This arrangement would yield the opposite stereoisomer
upon alkene reduction, as was observed experimentally.

Second- and
Third-Generation Libraries
In a typical
ISM strategy, one uses the single “best” mutant from
the previous round as an “anchor” for libraries focused
on other positions that had positive (albeit lower) impacts in first-round
libraries.10a This was not appropriate
in our case, however, because the three different substrates yielded
either different “best” mutants in round 1 (alkenes 1 and 2) or no significant improvement (alkene 3). Moreover, because our goal was to understand structure–function
relationships in substrate binding by OYE 2.6, we pursued parallel
strategies for all three substrates that started from different “best”
round 1 mutants, regardless of whether they were optimal in the context
of single amino acid changes. By doing this, we hoped to answer three
key questions. First, would the multiple, parallel evolutionary pathways
converge to the same solution, or would we obtain different sets of
mutations for a given substrate, depending on the pathway? Second,
would the same mutations be optimal for all three of the structurally
related substrates, or would the solutions be idiosyncratic? Finally,
could we uncover useful multiply mutated proteins from singly mutated
precursors that lacked detectable catalytic activity?

We created
second-generation libraries from four “anchor” mutants
that showed significant changes in substrate binding orientation preferences
(as reflected by enhanced R stereoselectivity)—Tyr78Trp,
Ile113Asp, Ile113Trp, and Val294Pro—using the same methods
as described above (Table 1, Figure 5). All of these libraries were screened “blind”,
that is, not sequenced prior to screening, and only those clones showing
improved properties were subsequently examined by fluorescence sequencing.
Because the changes were most significant for cyclopentenone 2, this substrate is discussed first, and the evolutionary
path for this substrate is summarized in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Summary of mutagenesis focused on cyclopentenone 2.
Starting from wild-type OYE 2.6, 13 different amino acid positions
were subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis, and the resulting first-generation
libraries were screened against alkene 2 (round 1). Enantioselectivities
of key proteins are indicated (red = R; blue = S). Libraries that failed to yield mutants with enhanced R selectivity are shown in gray type and marked by “×”.
Four useful variants were identified in round 1: Y78W, I113W, F247Y,
and F247W. These four, as well as two others identified in a screen
against substrate 1, were used as starting proteins for
site-saturation libraries anchored by the indicated mutations (round
2). Starting mutants with no change in stereoselectivity or no catalytic
activity toward substrate 1 are indicated by gray type and “(×)”.

Cyclopentenone 2
Val294 Pro Anchored Libraries
We created two site-saturation
libraries starting from the Val294 Pro variant. In a wild-type background,
this change decreased S stereoselectivity toward 1, although catalytic efficiency was also significantly reduced.
It was therefore not surprising that variations at both Tyr78 and
Ile113 in a Val294 Pro background showed no improvement with respect
to alkene 2, and this anchor position was dropped from
further consideration.20

Tyr78Trp
Anchored Libraries
The side chain of Tyr78
is located on the “eastern” side of the OYE 2.6 active
site (as viewed from above). Since replacement by Trp reversed the
stereoselectivity toward alkene 2, we used this mutant
as a starting point for three second-generation libraries focused
on amino acids found important in other contexts (Ile113, Phe247,
and Val294) (Figure 5). When Val294 was randomized
in a Tyr78Trp background, no additional change in protein properties
toward 2 was observed (the substrate was reduced to the R product in ∼80% ee).

When Ile113 was varied
in a wild-type background, changes at this position had very little
impact on stereoselectivity toward 2 (Figure 3A). By contrast, when the same residue was examined
in the context of a Tyr78Trp anchor, most Ile113 replacements showed
worse conversion or stereoselectivity as compared with the parent,
although the Tyr78Trp/Ile113Met double mutant showed slight improvement
(75% ee (S)) (Figure 6). Given
the close proximity of the side chains of amino acids at positions
78 and 113, it is perhaps not surprising that the effects of mutations
at these locations would be nonadditive. Although covarying these
two residues simultaneously might be logical strategy, the long analysis
times required for complete library coverage dissuaded us from following
this avenue.

Figure 6 Influence of Trp at position 78 on the impact of amino
acid replacements
for Ile113. A site-saturation library was created at position 113
(wt = Ile) in the Y78W variant of OYE 2.6. A collection 95 clones
containing NNK-randomized bases at position 113 of OYE 2.6 was tested
against Baylis–Hillman substrates 1 (●), 2 (■), and 3 (▲). Optical purity
data for points enclosed by parentheses could not be determined accurately
as a result of the low conversion levels. Data points for several
key variants are highlighted.

We also prepared the converse second-generation libraries
(randomized
at Tyr78 or Val294) in an Ile113 mutant background. The “best”
Ile113 changes were originally identified for alkene 1 (Ile113Asp) or 2 (Ile113Trp). Unfortunately, no improved
variants were detected for cyclopentenone 2 in the second-generation
libraries (Figure 5). This further underscores
the cooperativity between side chains at positions 78 and 113.

Finally, we also examined the effects of replacing Phe247 in the
context of pre-existing a Tyr78Trp mutation. Changes here in a wild-type
background had very little impact on stereoselectivity in round 1
(a slight decrease in S selectivity toward 2, but no improvement for 1 or 3). Nonetheless, we selected this position for a second-generation
library because the side chain of Phe247 is located on the “western”
side of the active site. We reasoned that a bulky indole side chain
at position 78 might have altered the steric environment on the “eastern”
side, which might now make amino acid replacements on the “western”
side more important. Although contrary to a strict ISM strategy, this
turned out to be the case: both the Ala and His replacements for Phe247
showed significantly higher stereoselectivity for cyclopentenone 2 in a Tyr78Trp background, as compared with the parent single
mutant (Figure 5). In fact, these double mutants
showed almost completely reversed stereoselectivities toward substrate 2 with good conversion, thereby providing a pair of practically
useful, enantiocomplementary counterparts to wild-type OYE 2.6.

Cyclohexenone 1
After successfully inverting
the stereoselectivity of OYE 2.6 toward cyclopentenone 2 by altering residues Tyr78, Ile113, and Phe247, we examined the
effects of these and other positions on the binding of cyclohexenone 1. All nine second-generation libraries were individually
screened for stereoselectivity in the reduction of 1 (Figure 7). Two of the anchor positions (Val294Pro and Ile113Asp)
were optimal first-generation substitutions for 1 with
diminished S stereoselectivity in a wild-type background.
Unfortunately, variations at additional positions (even those critical
for controlling the binding of 2) yielded no additional
improvement toward 1 in any of the second-generation
libraries. This was particularly surprising because the same libraries
had yielded significant differences in substrate binding orientation
toward the homologous Baylis–Hillman adduct 2.
Despite their structural similarities, subtle differences in binding
interactions between the way that OYE 2.6 binds alkenes 1 and 2 and must be present and account for the difference
in facial selectivity (vide infra).

Figure 7 Summary of mutagenesis focused on cyclohexenone 1.
Starting from wild-type OYE 2.6, 13 different amino acid positions
were subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis, and the resulting libraries
were screened for reduction of 1 (round 1). Enantioselectivities
of key proteins are indicated (red = R; blue = S). Libraries that failed to yield mutants with greater R selectivity are shown in gray type and marked by “×”.
Two useful variants were identified in round 1: I113D and V294P. These
two, as well as four others identified in a screen against substrate 2, were used as starting proteins for site-saturation libraries
anchored by the indicated mutations (round 2). Starting mutants with
no change in stereoselectivity or no catalytic activity toward substrate
1 are indicated by gray type and “(×)”.

Roche Ester Precursor 3
The major challenge
in altering OYE 2.6’s facial selectivity toward binding alkene 3 was that no first-generation library yielded any variants
that moved stereoselectivity in the desired R direction. In a traditional ISM approach, this means that the program must be
abandoned because no pathway is available for further improvement. Despite these apparently bleak prospects, we screened all nine second-generation
libraries for the ability to reduce alkene 3. Eight of
the nine libraries failed to provide a mutant with improved R selectivity (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Summary of
mutagenesis focused on Roche ester precursor 3. Starting
from wild-type OYE 2.6, 13 different amino acid positions
were subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis, and the resulting libraries
were screened for reduction of 1 (round 1). Enantioselectivities
of key proteins are indicated (red = R; blue = S). Libraries that failed to yield mutants with greater R selectivity are shown in gray and marked by “×”.
Note that no improved variants were identified in any first-generation
library. Nine second-round libraries were examined, each with an anchor
mutation that improved S selectivity toward substrate 1 or 2. One second-round library (Ile113 in a
Tyr78Trp background) yielded four variants with good S stereoselectivity toward 3. Randomizing the same position
in a double mutant background (Tyr78Trp/Phe247Ala or Tyr78Trp/Phe247His)
also provided four mutants, each with >95% ee (S).

The pivotal observation was that
varying Ile113 in a pre-existing
Tyr78Trp background yielded several variants with very high R stereoselectivities and good conversions (Figure 8). Replacing Ile113 with Cys, Val, Phe, or Leu afforded
proteins with ≥85% ee (R). This behavior
is remarkable because the Tyr78Trp single mutant had no detectable
catalytic activity toward 3. We also carried
out a third-generation library study anchored by the Tyr78Trp/Phe247Ala
or Tyr78Trp/Phe247His double alterations and varying Ile113, despite
the fact that both of these starting proteins showed no catalytic
activity toward alkene 3. Again, we recovered activity
when Ile113 was substituted by smaller residues. As before, Cys and
Val were the most effective in conferring R selectivity,
in this case ≥95% ee. That all the Ile113 libraries converged
to the same two “best” choices (Cys and Val) suggests
that these replacements are optimal in a Tyr78Trp background; the
role of changing Phe247 is to fine-tune the R stereoselectivity.
From a practical point of view, these two triple mutants have solved
the original synthetic problem. We can prepare both the S and R Roche ester antipodes in >95% ee using
wild-type
OYE 2.6 or one of the triple mutants, respectively.

Crystal Structure
of the Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys Double Mutant
To help understand
why these two simultaneous mutations so dramatically
altered the catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of OYE 2.6 with
respect to alkene 3, we solved the crystal structure
of this double mutant. As expected, the overall protein architecture
was essentially identical to that of the wild type. After molecular
replacement and a few rounds of refinement, however, it became apparent
that electron density in the vicinity of Cys 113 could not be fit
by a single side chain conformation. Even allowing for multiple Cys
side chain conformations failed to account for all of the observed
electron density. We therefore hypothesized that sulfur oxidation
had taken place before or during X-ray data collection.21 We attempted to fit the observed electron density
data by substituting the most commonly observed cysteine side chain
oxidation products at position 113 and carried out one round of refinement.22 When no single residue type, even with multiple
conformations, could account for all of the observed electron density,
judicious combinations of an unmodified Cys and a Cys oxidation product
were tried. The best fit to the observed electron density was obtained
from a native cysteine residue along with a 3-sulfinoalanine with
occupancies of 0.35 and 0.65, respectively (Figure 9).

Figure 9 X-ray structure of the Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys mutant complexed with
alkene 3. Electron density in the vicinity of position
113 was best fit by a combination of Cys and 3-sulfinoalanine (PDB
residue code CSD) with occupancies of 0.35 and 0.65, respectively. Electron density
in a plane above the FMN could be explained by a combination of malonate
and alkene 3, with occupancies of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively.
The locations of key active site residues are indicated.

By postcrystallization soaking with alkene 3, we hoped
to observe a pseudo-Michaelis complex in which the substrate was bound
in the “flipped” binding orientation. We indeed found
positive electron density in a plane above the FMN that could not
be explained by either protein residues or the cofactor. Malonate
(present in the crystallization buffer at 1.2–2.4 M) is the
“default” ligand in this location for wild-type OYE
2.6,11 and malonate accounted for some
of the observed electron density in the double mutant; however, closer
inspection revealed that malonate bound by the double mutant was rotated
by ∼23° relative to its location in the wild-type protein.11 This placed one of its carboxylate moieties
farther from the density associated with the side chain at position
113, which may be due to the negative charge of 3-sulfinoalanine.
Malonate alone, however, could not explain all of the electron density
above the FMN cofactor.23 We therefore
modeled alkene 3 into the active site (along with malonate).
The carbonyl oxygen of 3 was fixed within hydrogen bonding
distance of both His188 and His191 because these interactions are
known to be crucial for catalysis by OYE 2.611.24 The ligand was then rotated about
this point until the π-electron system of the alkene coincided
with the additional positive electron density above the FMN and the
best fit was obtained after refinement. This located the alkene terminus
near the side chains of Thr35 and Tyr374 (Figure 9). Occupancies of 0.7 and 0.3 for malonate and alkene 3, respectively, gave the best fit to the observed electron
density data.

Two features argue that the modeled complex with 3 in Figure 9 closely mimics the actual
Michaelis
complex that precedes alkene reduction. First, the β-carbon
of alkene 3 (C4) was 3.34
Å away from N5 of the FMN and the C4–N5–N10 angle was 100.6°. Both values
are within the ranges observed for efficient hydride transfer from
flavins.25 Second, this binding mode predicts
that 3 would be reduced to the R product,
consistent with behavior observed experimentally.

The crystallographically
deduced binding arrangement for alkene 3 placed the hydroxymethyl
side chain of alkene 3 near Gly292 and Asp293, which
are part of a flexible active site
loop (loop 6) that is rather hydrophilic. The best fit to the observed
electron density suggested an intramolecular hydrogen bond between
the hydroxyl group of alkene 3 and the carbonyl oxygen.26 This “flipped” binding mode located
the methoxy group of alkene 3 in a pocket partially formed
by the two mutated resides (Trp78 and Cys113).

On the basis
of these data and structures of wild-type OYE 2.6
and the Tyr78Trp single mutant, we can provide a rationale for the
experimental results observed during library screening. Using the
criteria described above, we modeled reasonable complexes of alkene 3 in both the “normal” and “flipped”
orientations with wild-type OYE 2.6 as well as the Tyr78Trp and Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys
mutants. When alkene 3 is bound to the wild type protein
in the “normal” orientation, the substrate hydroxymethyl
group is located sufficiently close to the side chain of Tyr78 to
form a critical hydrogen bond with this residue (mimicking the interaction
of this residue with WAT 611 in Figure 4).
The alternative, “flipped” orientation is highly disfavored
in wild-type OYE 2.6 because the methoxy moiety is too large to fit
in the pocket partially defined by Tyr78 and Ile113. The net result
is that wild-type OYE 2.6 can bind 3 productively only
in the “normal” orientation, which yields the S product.

When Tyr78 is changed to Trp, there is
no longer sufficient room
for the hydroxymethyl moiety of alkene 3 in the “normal”
orientation (Figure 4). As noted above, the
methoxy group is also too large for this active site volume in the
alternative, “flipped” orientation. Because the substrate
cannot be accommodated productively in either binding
mode, the Tyr78Trp mutant loses the ability to reduce 3. On the other hand, when the hydroxymethyl side chain of alkene 3 cannot hydrogen bond with the Tyr at position 78 (because
it was mutated Trp), but additional room is created
in this region by changing Ile to Cys to accommodate the methoxy group,
the “flipped” binding mode is not only enabled, but
also favored. This is also consistent with the observation that all
of the best R-selective double mutants (anchored
with Tyr78Trp) for alkene 3 possessed smaller residues
at position 113 as compared with the wild-type Ile.

Overivew of
Library Results
One key goal in this project
was to determine which residue(s) controlled substrate binding orientation
in OYE 2.6. On the basis of our results, Tyr78 and Ile113 are most
critical, with Phe247 playing a subordinate role. The first two residues
make close contacts within the active site, and the synergistic impacts
of mutations at these positions are not unexpected. Together, they
form the “eastern” wall of the active site. The side
chain of Phe247 is located on the opposite site, and by substituting
this amino acid by with smaller homologues, additional space is created
to accommodate a “flipped” substrate binding orientation.
In this way, changes at Phe247 complement those at the Tyr78/Ile113
couple. It is worth noting that the three key residues controlling
stereoselectivity lie close to the substrate, but others with less
influence lie even closer (or alternatively, those lying closer cannot
be changed without harming catalytic activity).

Key OYE 2.6
variants selected during the course of this study were purified as
glutathione (S)-transferase fusion proteins and assayed
for reductions of substrates 1 – 3 (Table 3). This allowed for consistent protein
quantities that avoided artifacts due to differences in expression
levels during whole-cell-catalyzed alkene reductions. In the case
of cyclopentenone 2, there was clear interplay between
the side chains at positions 78 and 113, and the two most R-selective mutants paired Trp with either Ile or Met. Substituting
even similar residues at position 113 (e.g., Phe, Leu, or Val) significantly
diminished the R selectivity. These observations
parallel our earlier results from S. pastorianus OYE 1, in which very similar amino acid replacements at position
116 (which corresponds to position 113 of P. stipitis OYE 2.6) provoked highly divergent stereoselectivities.18

Table 3 Catalytic Properties

2.6 and Key Variants
a Enantiomeric purity
could not be
accurately assessed because of low conversion.

When all three substrates were considered
together, the best overall
performer was the Tyr78Trp/Phe247Ala variant. This protein gave essentially
complete R selectivity for alkene 3,
91% ee favoring the R product from cyclopentenone 2, and the lowest observed S selectivity
for cyclohexenone 1 (37% ee). That the two targeted positions
lie on opposite sides of the active site and create additional site
volume provides one explanation for their effects. From a preparative
standpoint, the only deficiency of the Tyr78Trp/Phe247 Ala double
mutant was its poor catalytic efficiency against alkene 3; however, this was remedied by the additional replacement of Ile113
by Cys or Val.

Interestingly, it was possible to create OYE
2.6 variants with
altered stereoselectivity toward substrates 2 and 3, but not for 1. Given the apparent structural
similarity between cyclic homologues 1 and 2, this was unexpected. One possible reason emerged from a comparison
of potential enzyme–substrate complexes for the three Baylis–Hillman
adducts. Low-energy conformations for alkenes 1–3 (generated by MM2 molecular mechanics) were overlaid using
the enone (C=O, Cα and Cβ) and side chain methylene moieties, then the aggregate was modeled
into the active site of wild-type OYE 2.6 in the “flipped”
orientation by reference to the experimentally determined position
of p-chlorophenol (Figure 1; PDB 4DF2).
The side chain hydroxymethyl group was rotated to match its position
in a crystal structure of 2 complexed to S. pastorianus OYE 1 (PDB 3RND). For comparison, the experimentally
determined structure of the Tyr78Trp OYE 2.6 variant (PDB 4QAI) was also overlaid
(Figure 10).

Figure 10 “Flipped” substrate binding
in wild-type and Tyr78Trp
OYE 2.6. Alkenes 1, 2, and 3 were overlaid as described in the text and modeled into the active
site of wild-type OYE 2.6 (PDB code 4DF2) by aligning the substrate Cβ and carbonyl oxygens with the corresponding atoms of p-chlorophenol (substrate carbons are colored by substrate: 1, yellow; 2, green; 3, blue). Experimentally
determined coordinates for wild-type and Tyr78Trp OYE 2.6 (PDB codes 4DF2 and 4QAI; carbons shown in
light blue and gray, respectively) were overlaid using the bound FMN
moieties, and side chains of residues at positions 78 and 113 are
shown in stick form. Key interatomic distances (in Å) are indicated
along with the angle for hydride transfer from N5 of reduced
FMN (101.3°).

One key difference between 1 and 2 is
that the former occupies a half-chair conformation and the latter
is nearly planar (Figure 10). This also means
that a CH2 moiety in 1 projects above or below
the plane of the ring, bringing it very close to the side chain at
position 78.27 Although the precise distances
depicted in Figure 10 are subject to uncertainties,
it is clear that the out-of-plane CH2 group of 1 makes a significantly closer approach to the side chain at position
78 than does alkene 2. Moreover, although the overall
size of the Trp side chain is larger than that of Tyr, the latter
more closely approaches the cyclopentenyl ring of 2 (Figure 10). This might explain why the “flipped”
substrate binding orientation is not observed when 2 is
reduced by wild-type OYE 2.6 but can occur when Trp replaces Tyr78.
That both a Tyr and Trp side chain at position 78 appear to be too
large to allow binding of 1 in a “flipped”
orientation may explain why an alternative binding mode is not observed
for this alkene.

The major surprise in evolving a catalyst for S-selective reduction of Roche ester precursor 3 was
that all useful variants were forced to pass through an intermediate
stage devoid of catalytic activity (Tyr78Trp).

Conclusions
Several lessons emerged from this study.
First, when high-quality randomized libraries are available, even
protein engineering projects requiring relatively lengthy analyses
such as chiral-phase GC are feasible. In addition, although side chain
proximity to the substrate can provide a rough guide to importance
in controlling binding interactions, one must experimentally interrogate
each position to establish its role. Like its counterpart in S. pastorianus OYE 1 (Trp116), (9) Ile113 in OYE 2.6 plays a crucial role in controlling substrate
binding; however, its influence is not felt fully until its neighbor
(Tyr78) is altered. This behavior stands in contrast to OYE 1, where
substitutions for Trp116 have significant impacts even in a wild-type
background. The interplay between substitutions at positions 78 and
113 highlights the nonadditivity of mutational effects that can occur
during protein engineering studies. In such cases, relying on successive
rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis at single positions may not
always yield the most improved multiply mutated variant(s). On the
other hand, the potential benefits of simultaneously substituting
several amino acids within single libraries must also be balanced
against the much larger screening efforts required to interrogate
the resulting libraries. (10)

With
regard to the questions posed at the start of the project, the “best”
evolutionary pathways for two of the substrates were similar, and
common changes were appropriate for both (Figures 5 and 8). For example, in a Tyr78Trp
background, substitutions of Phe247 yielded Ala and His as the best
replacements for both alkenes 2 and 3. Since
both screening efforts were carried out independently, we believe
that this indicates that sequence space has been completely sampled
in this region. As a second example, random replacements of Ile113
with pre-existing mutations at Tyr78Trp, Tyr78Trp/Phe247Ala, or Tyr78Trp/Phe247His
all yielded Ile113Cys and Ile113Val as the optimal replacements for
alkene 3. That all three starting proteins yielded the
same Ile113 replacements strongly suggests that the system has converged
and that Cys and Val are the “best” residue at this
position (at least in the context of the substrates studied).

The general utility of the final OYE 2.6 variants remains a somewhat
open question. Although a subset provided good conversion efficiency
and reversed stereoselectivity for alkenes 2 and 3 (Table 3), this was not the case
for cyclohexenone 1. We are currently studying the reductions
of other alkenes with the variants listed in Table 3 as a means of establishing their general utility.

The
final lesson from these studies is that one must sometimes
cross a “desert” of sequence space before re-establishing
catalytic activity and seeking better variants. This was clearly the
case for Roche ester precursor 3, and it was only by
pursuing three parallel protein engineering studies that a solution
was found for this synthetically valuable substrate.

Experimental
Section
General
Restriction endonucleases, Phusion Hot Start
II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, restriction enzyme DpnI and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Primers
were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Escherichia
coli ElectroTen-Blue and BL21-Gold (DE3) strains were
purchased from Agilent Technologies, USA. Plasmids were purified on
small scales by EconoSpin columns (Epoch Life Sciences) and on large
scales using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation.28 Plasmids were transformed into E. coli cells by a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus
using the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA sequencing was carried
out by the University of Florida ICBR using capillary fluorescence
methods and employing either standard protocols (single samples or
pooled plasmid samples) or rolling circle amplification (96 well bacterial
culture plates). Plasmid pBS2, which encodes wild-type P. stipitis OYE 2.6, has been described elsewhere.11 LB medium contained 5 g/L Bacto-Yeast extract,
10 g/L Bacto-Tryptone, and 10 g/L NaCl. When required, ampicillin
was included at 200 μg/mL. ZYP-5052 autoinducing media contained
10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 50 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM Na2HPO4, 5 g/L glycerol, 0.5
g/L anhydrous glucose, and 2 g/L α-lactose monohydrate.29 All protein isolation steps were carried out
at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH102)
was a generous gift from BioCatalytics.

Alkenes 1–3 and authentic standards for their reduction
products were prepared as described previously.9 All other reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers
and were used as received unless otherwise indicated. Chiral-phase
GC analyses were carried out with a 30 m × 0.25 mm β-Dex
225 column (Supelco) with He as the carrier gas and FID. For analysis
of 1 and 2 and their reduction products,
the temperature program involved 140 °C (10 min) followed by
a 20 °C/min increase to 180 °C (5 min). Under these conditions,
the S and R reduction products from 1 eluted at 10.2 and 10.8 min, respectively, and 1 was observed at 13.1 min. The S and R reduction products from 2 eluted at 11.3 and 10.2 min,
respectively, and 2 was observed at 13.4 min.30 For analysis of 3 and its reduction
products, the temperature program involved 100 °C (12 min), followed
by a 20 °C/min increase to 180 °C (5 min). Under these conditions,
the S and R reduction products from 3 eluted at 10.7 and 11.3 min, respectively, and substrate 3 was observed at 11.8 min.

Library Construction
Details of the library construction
methodology have been published elsewhere.15 A list of primers used to create first-generation libraries beyond
those reported in ref (15) is shown in Table 4. Second- and third-generation
libraries were prepared by the same methods, with the appropriate
mutant OYE 2.6 gene replacing the wild-type as the template in PCR
amplifications. The pooled degenerate plasmid sample (1 ng) was used
to transform 40 μL of electrocompetent BL21 Gold (DE3) cells.
After recovery for 1 h at 37 °C in 600 μL of SOC medium,
cells were spread on LB agar plates containing 200 μg/mL ampicillin
and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Ninety five individual transformants
(plus a control, wild-type for first-generation libraries or the starting
mutant for second- and third-generation libraries) were used to seed
a 2 mL deepwell plate containing LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/mL
ampicillin. For some libraries, all 96 plasmids were prepared by rolling
circle amplification and sequenced. On the basis of the sequencing
data, clones representing each of the 32 possible codons (when available)
were used to seed 600 μL of LB media containing 200 μg/mL
ampicillin arrayed on one-third of a deepwell plate (2 mL total volume
per well) to yield library master plates. The initially prepared first-generation
library of Ile113 random replacements was missing three members (Asp,
Lys, and Phe); these were prepared individually and added to yield
a complete set of amino acid replacements. For those libraries not
sequenced prior to screening, catalytic properties of all 96 clones
were evaluated, and only members that showed interesting properties
were analyzed by DNA sequencing (“blind screening”).

Library Screening
Library screening
plates were prepared
from library master plates, either freshly grown in LB medium supplemented
with 200 μg/mL ampicillin or from frozen stocks. In the former
case, the library master plate was shaken at 200 rpm and 37 °C.
After 6 h, the cultures were visibly turbid, and a 20 μL aliquot
from each well was used to inoculate wells in a duplicate deepwell
plate containing 600 μL of ZYP-5052 autoinducing medium supplemented
with 200 μg/mL ampicillin. Alternatively, the autoinduction
plates were inoculated directly from frozen library master plates.
After seeding, library screening plates were then mounted in a growth
apparatus designed to facilitate maximal oxygen transfer rates (modified
from the design of Duetz and Witholt3132) and shaken at 300 rpm and 37 °C. After
16–18 h, cells were harvested by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for
30 min, and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 300 μL of 50 mM KPi, 100 mM glucose,
10 mM substrate, pH 7.0. The plate was shaken at 200 rpm at room temp.
After 6 h, wells were individually extracted with 500 μL of
EtOAc prior to chiral-phase GC analysis.

Isolation of GST-Fusion
Proteins
Overexpression plasmids
for each alkene reductase (produced as GST-fusion proteins) were separately
used to transform E. coli BL21 Gold
(DE3). Overnight cultures grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented
with ampicillin were diluted 1:100 into 500 mL of the same medium
and shaken at 37 °C until the O.D.600 value was between
0.5 and 1.0. Alkene reductase overexpression was induced by adding
IPTG (to a final concentration of 100 μM) and glucose (at a
final concentration of 4 g/L). The cultures were shaken at room temperature
for 4 h prior to collecting the cells by centrifugation. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 10 mL of cold buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM PMSF,
pH 7.5) and lysed using a French pressure cell (10 000–20 000
psi). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifuging at 15 000g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was
passed through 10 mL of glutathione agarose (Clontech) using an FPLC
system (Pharmacia) with 1× PBS buffer as the mobile phase. Once
the A280 returned to a baseline reading,
the desired protein was eluted by adding 10 mL of reduced glutathione
(10 mM, freshly prepared) in Tris–HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0), and
then the appropriate fractions were concentrated to ∼20–40
mg/mL by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-4 membrane, 10 000 NMWL).
An equal volume of glycerol was added prior to storage at −20
°C.

Isolation of Nontagged Alkene Reductases for X-ray Crystallography
Overexpression plasmids encoding a mutant alkene reductase (Tyr78Trp
OYE 2.6 and Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys OYE 2.6) were separately used to transform E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3). Cells were grown and induced
using the procedure described in the previous section. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 100 mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0, and lysed using a
French pressure cell (10 000–20 000 psi). Insoluble
debris was removed by centrifuging at 15 000g for 60 min at 4 °C. DNA was precipitated from the supernatant
by the addition of 0.1 volume of protamine sulfate (10 mg/mL stock
solution) followed by stirring for 10 min and centrifuging at 15 000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant until 78% saturation,
then the pellet was collected by centrifuging at 15 000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended
in a minimal volume (7–10 mL) of buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl,
100 mM (NH4)2SO4, pH 8.0), then dialyzed
against two changes of the same buffer over a total of 8 h. A final
dialysis was performed against the same buffer supplemented with 10
mM Na2S2O4 over 4 h.33 The final dialysis step (8 h) was performed with the omission
of the Na2S2O4. The resulting bright
yellow dialysate was loaded onto a 3 mL N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)aminohexyl
agarose affinity resin34 previously equilibrated
with starting buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, pH 8.0) using an FPLC system (Pharmacia).
The resin turned dark brown, indicating successful OYE 2.6 binding.
The column was washed with starting buffer until the A280 value returned to its baseline reading, then the desired
protein was eluted by adding 3 resin volumes of deoxygenated starting
buffer supplemented with 10 mM Na2S2O4 (degassed under vacuum for 20 min and flushed with N2 prior to adding the reducing agent).35 The appropriate fractions were concentrated to ∼20–40
mg/mL by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-4 membrane, 10 000 NMWL).
Final purification was achieved by gel filtration chromatography using
a Superdex 200 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 30 mM Tris–HCl,
30 mM NaCl, pH7.5. The eluted protein was concentrated to ∼30–40
mg/mL prior to use in crystallization studies.

Crystallogenesis
Crystals were grown using the sitting
drop vapor diffusion method from 2.4 M sodium malonate pH 7.0. After
growth, the crystals were mounted into appropriately sized loops and
transferred to a harvesting buffer (3.0 M sodium malonate, 10% glycerol
v/v, pH 7.0) supplemented with a saturated amount of substrate prior
to flash cooling in liquid N2.

Data Collection and Structure
Solution
Diffraction
data were collected using synchotron radiation under cryogenic conditions.
Reflection data for the Tyr78Trp OYE 2.6 were processed by an in-house
program to yield a merged set suitable for refinement; those for the
Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys OYE 2.6 were processed using the HKL3000 program
suite.36 Phases were obtained by molecular
replacement using the AutoMR utility of PHENIX37 using the wild-type P. stipitis OYE 2.6 (PDB code 3TJL) as the search model (after removing FMN, water molecules, and nonidentical
side chains). The initially calculated 2F0–Fc and F0–Fc maps showed easily identifiable electron density
patterns for the FMN, which served as a validation for the molecular
replacement solution. Iterative cycles of refinement and model building,
with PHENIX and COOT,38 respectively, were
performed until the error statistics reached acceptable levels. At
this stage of refinement, the active site contained areas of unaccounted-for
electron density. Potential ligand structures were built using proDrg39 and then incorporated into the model for further
refinement. All protein structure figures were created using PyMOL
(Schrödinger, LLC).

Alkene Reductions by Purified Proteins
Reaction mixtures
(0.30 mL total volume) contained wild-type or a mutant OYE 2.6 (∼100
μg), glucose dehydrogenase (75 μg), NADP+ (0.20
mM), glucose (220 mM), and alkene substrate 1, 2, or 3 (10 mM) in KPi, pH 7.0. Reactions
were incubated at room temp, then extracted with an equal quantity
of EtOAc and analyzed by chiral-phase GC.

No Cβ/inhibitor distance
could be measured for the residue at position 292 because it is occupied
by Gly in wild-type OYE 2.6.

Byproducts
in which one or more copies of
the PCR primers become incorporated. Because this inserts additional
amino acids within the protein, such mutants are highly unlikely to
retain function.


Because
32 codons are possible in the NNK
scheme, this allowed three different randomized positions to be examined
on a single 96 well “Superplate”.

A complete set of 32 NNK codons was screened
to ensure complete coverage at position 78.


In all cases, positive controls showed very
high conversions, which ruled out experimental artifacts as the explanation
for the lack of catalytic activities in these libraries.


To retain consistency with earlier
studies,
no disulfide reducing agents were included in the purification or
crystallization buffers for the Tyr78Trp/Ile113Cys double mutant.

Attempts
to explain the additional electron
density by a second malonate in a different location were unsuccessful.


The carbonyl oxygen of 3 was
initially placed
at the same location as the phenolic oxygen of p-chlorophenol
bound in the active site of OYE 2.6 (a structure solved in an earlier
study; PDB code 4DF2).

Although the side chain
was modeled as a
single conformation, the somewhat weak electron density in this location
suggests that other rotamers may coexist within the crystals.


The alternative half-chair conformation
of 1 cannot be accommodated because the out-of-plane
CH2 group would collide with the FMN cofactor (the distance
would be
∼1.4 A).

This step, referred to as “degreening”,
removes low-molecular-weight ligands from the enzyme active site that
would otherwise interfere with binding to the affinity column.
