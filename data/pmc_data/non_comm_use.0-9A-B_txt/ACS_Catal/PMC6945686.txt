Acyltransferases isolated from Pseudomonas
protegens (PpATase) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfATase)
have recently been reported to catalyze
the Friedel–Crafts acylation, providing a biological version
of this classical organic reaction. These enzymes catalyze the cofactor-independent
acylation of monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG) to diacetylphloroglucinol
(DAPG) and phloroglucinol (PG) and have been demonstrated to have
a wide substrate scope, making them valuable for potential applications
in biocatalysis. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism
of PpATase on the basis of quantum chemical calculations,
employing a large model of the active site. The proposed mechanism
is consistent with available kinetics, mutagenesis, and structural
data. The roles of various active site residues are analyzed. Very
importantly, the Asp137 residue, located more than 10 Å from
the substrate, is predicted to be the proton source for the protonation
of the substrate in the rate-determining step. This key prediction
is corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Based on
the current calculations, the regioselectivity of PpATase and its specificity toward non-natural substrates can be rationalized.

1 Introduction
The Friedel–Crafts
acylation is the Lewis or Brønsted
acid-catalyzed electrophilic aromatic substitution for the synthesis
of aromatic ketones using, for example, acyl chlorides or anhydrides
as the acylating agents (Scheme 1a).1 Recently, acyltransferases
isolated from the bacteria Pseudomonas protegens (PpATase) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfATase)2 have been
reported to catalyze the Friedel–Crafts acylation,3 providing a biological alternative to the traditional
strategy. In contrast to the common O-, N-, and S-acylation reactions,
the PpATase and PfATase enzymes
catalyze C-acylation/deacylation of monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG)
to diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and phloroglucinol (PG),2,3 as shown in Scheme 1b. The reaction is cofactor-independent and does not require high
energy-activated acyl donors, such as 1-O-acylglucosides,
acyl carrier proteins, or quinic acid ester. These enzymes are thus
of potential interest for the synthesis of aromatic ketones.

Scheme 1 (a) Friedel–Crafts
Acylation and (b) Enzymatic Friedel–Crafts
Acylation Catalyzed by Acyltransferases from P. protegens (PpATase) and P. fluorescens (PfATase)
PpATase is a multimeric enzyme
composed of three
subunits, PhlA, PhlB, and PhlC,2a,4 which are arranged in
a Phl(A2C2)2B4 composition, according to the X-ray structures solved
very recently.5 Mutational analysis reveals
that only the PhlC subunit is directly involved in the catalysis.5 In the crystallographic structure, the Cys88
residue was found to be acetylated when MAPG was used as a substrate
(Figure 1), and mutation
of this residue eliminated the activity of the enzyme. Combining these
experimental findings, Cys88 has been suggested to be crucial for
the catalysis and is likely to act as a nucleophile to attack the
acyl group of the substrate.5 Also, mutations
of other residues, such as His56, His144, Tyr298, His347, Ser349,
and Asp352, showed extremely low or no activity.5 The roles of these residues are, however, unclear.

in complex with PG (PDB 5MG5).

The substrate scope of PpATase
has been investigated
in recent studies, which demonstrated that this enzyme is capable
of catalyzing the Friedel–Crafts acetylation of various resorcinol
derivatives by using a wide range of acyl donors, such as acetate
derivatives, phenyl esters, and thioesters.3a,6,7 Importantly, the acetylation is found to
be highly chemo- and regioselective. No O-acetylated,
polysubstituted, or hydrolyzed product was observed. The acetyl group
was exclusively added by the enzyme to the carbon in position 4 of
the resorcinol substrates, thus in the ortho-position to one hydroxyl
group and in para-position to the other hydroxyl group. PpATase can be regarded as a valuable biocatalyst for the selective
synthesis of various aryl ketones by C–C bond formation.8 Furthermore, this enzyme exhibits promiscuous
activity in catalyzing the amide formation in aqueous buffer using
aniline derivatives as substrates,9 and
very interestingly, it also enables the Fries rearrangement of resorcinol
derivatives.3a This increases further the
biocatalytic potential of PpATase.

The enzyme
is active on resorcinol-derived compounds as acetyl
acceptors, but is inactive toward phenol, catechol, or hydroquinone.3a This means that at least two hydroxyl groups
in 1,3-position are required for the acylation.

Mechanistic
insights into the reaction mechanism will be helpful
in order to further improve the catalytic performance of PpATase, as only limited knowledge is known to date. In the present
study, the detailed reaction mechanism of this enzyme is investigated
using quantum chemical methodology.10 A
large model of the active site, consisting of more than 400 atoms,
is designed on the basis of the crystal structure of the PG-bound
enzyme with an acylated Cys88,5 and various
enzyme–substrate complexes with different orientations of the
MAPG substrate are first considered. After establishing the binding
mode of the substrate, the mechanistic investigation is conducted,
and a reaction mechanism with feasible energy barriers is proposed.
The calculations will make predictions as to the nature of key residues,
and mutational experiments are conducted to examine these suggestions.
The regioselectivity of PpATase and the specificity
toward non-natural substrates will also be discussed and rationalized.

Here, it is important to stress that from the computational point
of view, the present study is challenging in terms of the large size
of the employed active site model and the large number of calculations
required to determine the reaction pathway. The active site of the
enzyme includes many polar residues, which can direct the substrate
in different orientations by forming hydrogen bonds to the three hydroxyl
groups and the acetyl group on the aromatic ring of the substrate.
Thus, a large model has been necessary in order to accurately describe
the protein environment and the different binding modes. For each
binding mode, structures with different conformations and rotamers
have to be considered in order to ensure that the lowest energy structures
are located. Moreover, the protonation states of certain residues
have also to be examined, increasing further the computational efforts.

2 Computational Details
2.1 Technical Details
The calculations
were performed using the Gaussian 09 program11 with the B3LYP hybrid density functional method.12 Dispersion effects were described by the D3-BJ version
of Grimme’s empirical method13 and
were included in all calculations, including the geometry optimizations.
The geometry optimizations were carried out with the 6-31G(d,p) basis
set, and single-point energies were calculated at the same level of
theory using the SMD solvation model14 with
the value of dielectric constant ε = 4. Frequency calculations
were preformed to obtain zero-point energies (ZPEs). To get more accurate
electronic energies, single-point calculations on the optimized structures
were performed with the larger basis set 6-311+G(2d,2p). The values
presented throughout the paper are thus the large basis set energies
(which include dispersion effect) corrected for ZPE and solvation
effects.

2.2 Active Site Model
A model of the
active site was designed on the basis of the crystal structure of PpATase in complex with PG, in which the Cys88 residue is
acetylated (PDB 5MG5).5 To construct the active site model
in the initial enzyme–substrate complex form, the acetylated
Cys88 was modified back to the native form, and PG was replaced by
MAPG. To arrive at the final active site model, preliminary models
were first examined, with different sizes, substrate binding modes,
hydrogen bonding patterns, and protonation states of various residues.
These initial models were also used to scan possible reaction mechanisms.
Here, we present the results of the largest model (shown in Figure 2), which yielded
the most feasible energies and energy barriers. Apart from the MAPG
substrate and Cys88, the model includes the residues forming hydrogen
bonds with the substrate (His56, Tyr124, His144, Tyr298, and His347)
and other residues forming the active site cavity (Glu58, Ala86, Asn87,
Thr89, Glu116, Tyr127, Ile128, Ser130, Ser131, Thr132, Asp137, Thr145,
Phe148, Leu209, Trp211, Leu300, Ala348, Ser349, Asp352, Leu383, Gly384,
Gly385, Tyr386, and His389). The final active site model consists
of 413 atoms, with an overall charge of −2. To avoid unrealistic
movements during the geometry optimizations, a number of atoms were
kept fixed, as shown in Figure 2. The fixed atoms are at the edge of this large model, allowing
thus enough flexibility to the active site residues to adapt to the
changes of geometries along the reaction. This procedure results in
a number of small imaginary frequencies that can be ignored because
they do not contribute significantly to the ZPE and thus to the final
energy.

Figure 2 Optimized structure (a) and schematic illustration (b) of the active
site model. Atoms fixed during geometry optimizations are marked with
asterisks. Selected distances are given in angstrom.

The protonation states of the various active site
residues in the
model are worth a comment here. First, it has been previously suggested
that Cys88 is in the ionized form already before transformation of
the substrate under the reaction condition because no base was found
in the vicinity of this residue to affect its deprotonation.5 However, we noticed that the Asp352 residue is
in fact less than 5 Å away from the side chain of Cys88 and could
possibly be the general base responsible for its activation. To test
this, we optimized the geometry of the enzyme–substrate complex
with either Cys88 or Asp352 in the deprotonated form and the other
in the neutral form. Indeed, the calculations show that the activation
of Cys88 by Asp352 is a plausible scenario because the energy of the
enzyme–substrate complex in which Cys88 is in the deprotonated
form, and Asp352 is neutral is more than 5 kcal/mol lower than when
Cys88 is neutral and Asp352 is ionized. In the active site model,
Cys88 was thus chosen to be in the ionized form and Asp352 in the
neutral form. Because His347 forms a hydrogen bond to Asp352, this
histidine residue was also modeled as neutral. Similarly, His144 and
Asp137 residues, which are bridged by Thr132, were chosen to be in
their neutral forms. Initially, the His56 and Glu58 residues, bridged
by Tyr127, were also modeled as neutral species. However, a proton
transfer from Glu58 to His56 took place spontaneously during the geometry
optimization, resulting in an ionized Glu58 and a protonated His56
(Figure 2). The Glu116
residue is chosen to be in the ionized form because preliminary calculations
showed that it acts as a general base to deprotonate the hydroxyl
group of the substrate in the first step of the reaction. Finally,
the other ionizable residue His389 is modeled in the neutral form
because no negatively charged group is located in the vicinity.

3 Results and Discussion
The overall
reaction of PpATase consists of two
half-reactions: the acylation of enzyme by the first MAPG substrate
(first half-reaction) and the subsequent deacylation of enzyme by
acyl transfer to the second MAPG substrate (second half-reaction, Scheme 2). As will be demonstrated
below, the deacylation process follows the reverse of the acylation
reaction in terms of the step sequence, with only some small differences
in the energies. Therefore, a detailed discussion of the acylation
half-reaction will be presented first, while the deacylation process
will be only briefly discussed. Next, support for the suggested mechanism
will be presented in the form of mutagenesis experiments. Finally,
a number of alternative mechanistic scenarios that were examined and
that were found to be associated with higher energies will be discussed
briefly.

Scheme 2 Two Half-Reactions in the Friedel–Crafts Acylation Catalyzed
by PpATase
3.1 Reaction Mechanism
In the enzyme–substrate
complex (called E:S, see Figure 2), the MAPG substrate is found to bind such
that the acyl group points toward the area defined by His144, Phe148,
and Leu383. The carbonyl oxygen of MAPG forms a hydrogen bond to His144
and an intramolecular hydrogen bond to the C3 ortho-hydroxyl group, which in turn interacts with His56. The C1 ortho-hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond to Tyr298, and
the hydroxyl group at para-position (C5–OH) forms hydrogen
bonds to His347 and Tyr124. The structure of E:S displays
a high similarity to the X-ray structure of the active site (see Supporting Information for a superposition of
the two structures).

Starting from E:S, the first
step of the reaction is the deprotonation of C5–OH by Glu116,
via Tyr124 (E:S→Int1, Scheme 3). The resulting intermediate Int1 is only 0.3 kcal/mol lower than E:S, and
this step is calculated to be essentially barrier-less15 (see Figure 3 for the energy profile and Figure 4 for the optimized structures).

energy profile for the proposed mechanism of PpATase.

Figure 4 Optimized structures of intermediates and transition states
in
the first half-reaction of the suggested mechanism. For clarity, only
a part of the active site model is shown here, and most of nonpolar
hydrogens have been omitted. See Figure 2 for full model.

Scheme 3 Detailed Reaction Mechanism of PpATase Proposed
on the Basis of the Current Calculations
Next, nucleophilic attack of Cys88 on the carbonyl
carbon takes
place to form a covalent bond between the enzyme and the substrate
(Int1 → [TS1] → Int2, Scheme 3). Concurrently
with the formation of the C–S bond, a proton is transferred
from the C3–OH of the substrate to the forming alkoxide. The
calculated barrier for this step is 13.7 kcal/mol relative to Int1, and the formed tetrahedral intermediate (Int2) has the same energy as TS1 (Figure 3). At TS1, the distance of the
forming C–S bond is 2.35 Å. The proton transfer event
here is facilitated by a hydrogen bond from the positively charged
His56 to the ortho-hydroxyl group. His56 is thus
predicted to be important for catalysis, which is consistent with
experimental site-directed mutagenesis showing that the replacement
of this residue by either serine or alanine renders the enzyme inactive.5

Upon formation of Int2, the
reaction continues by
a proton transfer from Asp137 to His144 via Thr132, resulting in the
formation of intermediate Int3, which has a very similar
energy compared to Int2 (Figure 3). His144 then protonates the C2 carbon of
the substrate (Int3 → [TS2] → Int4). The calculations predict thus that the remote aspartic
acid residue Asp137 located more than 10 Å away from the C2 is
the source of the proton, which is shuttled to the substrate via Thr132
and His144 relays (Figure 4). The step of the C2 protonation is calculated to be rate-limiting
for the first half-reaction, with an overall barrier of 17.9 kcal/mol
relative to Int1, and the resulting intermediate (Int4) is 1.8 kcal/mol lower than Int1. An interesting
feature here is that Int4 has low energy, although the
aromaticity of the substrate is disrupted. The hydroxyl group at the
para-position has a key role because its deprotonation in the previous
step facilitates the formation of a relatively stable dienone intermediate,
in which a significant degree of conjugation is maintained.

Next, C–C bond cleavage takes place to form the acylated
enzyme and the PG product in the deprotonated form. In this step,
a proton is also simultaneously transferred from the C7–OH
back to the ortho-hydroxyl group (Int4 → [TS3] → Int5, Scheme 3). The barrier is
calculated to be 13.2 kcal/mol relative to Int4 (Figure 3). At the corresponding
transition state TS3, the breaking C–C bond is
2.06 Å (Figure 4). The first half-reaction is completed with the protonation of the para-hydroxyl group by Glu116 via Tyr124 (Int5 → Int6), and a step is calculated to be thermoneutral.
The acylated enzyme Int6 is calculated to be 2.5 kcal/mol
lower than E:S.

The optimized structure of Int6 from the calculations
is very similar to the crystal structure (PDB 5MG5),5 which represents the intermediate after the first half-reaction
(see Supporting Information for a superposition
of the two structures). This structural similarity lends further support
to the obtained mechanism and the validity of the active site model
used in the present study.

The reaction proceeds to the second
half-reaction by a ligand exchange
(Int6 → Int7, Scheme 3), in which the PG product of the first half-reaction
exits the active site and a second MAPG substrate enters. The binding
energy of MAPG relative to PG (ΔΔE) can
be estimated using the following equation  where E(PG)aq and E(MAPG)aq refer to the energies of PG and MAPG
in aqueous solution, respectively. Using this equation, Int7 is calculated to be 2.5 kcal/mol lower than Int6 (and
thus 5.0 kcal/mol lower than E:S). Although the procedure
used to estimate this energy is simple, compared to for instance the
much more expensive free energy perturbation technique, the obtained
value is quite reasonable, considering the high similarity between
the PG and MAPG compounds.

In Int7 (Figure 5), which is the lowest energy
binding mode of MAPG
to the active site of the acylated enzyme, the acyl group of MAPG
points toward the area defined by Trp211, Leu209, and Leu300. The
C5–OH forms a hydrogen bond with His144, and the C3–OH
interacts with Tyr124. By overlapping the structures of Int6 and Int7, some small changes of the geometries of the
various active site residues are observed, indicating that the active
site model has enough flexibility to accommodate the second MAPG substrate,
which is somewhat larger than the leaving PG (see Supporting Information). We have considered a number of different
binding modes for the second substrate, in particular one in which
it binds in a similar fashion as the first substrate in E:S. Although the energy of this alternative binding mode is not high
compared to Int7 (+1.6 kcal/mol), the calculations show
that this structure is unproductive because the following intermediate
is very high in energy (see Supporting Information for details).

Figure 5 Optimized structure of Int7, the acylated
enzyme with
the second MAPG bound.

Starting from Int7, the reaction follows
the reverse
of the first half-reaction (see Supporting Information for the optimized structures). A proton is first transferred from
the C3–OH to Glu116 via Tyr124 (Int7 → Int8, Scheme 3), followed by a C–C bond formation between the C6 carbon
of the substrate and the acyl group covalently bonded to Cys88 (Int8 → [TS4] → Int9). The C–C bond formation is concurrent with a proton transfer
from C5–OH to the carbonyl oxygen, highlighting again the importance
of a hydroxyl group at the ortho-position.

Next, the proton
at the C6 position of the resulting dienone intermediate
is abstracted by Asp137 via the Thr132 and His144 relays (Int9 → [TS5] → Int10 → Int11). The deprotonation of C6–H is calculated to
be the rate-limiting step of the second half-reaction, with a barrier
of 19.5 kcal/mol relative to Int7 (Figure 3). The final C–S bond cleavage occurs
readily (Int11 → [TS6] → E:P) with a barrier of only 3.5 kcal/mol relative to Int11, and the final enzyme–product complex (E:P) product is 4.6 kcal/mol lower than E:S.

Although the sequence of steps of the second half-reaction corresponds
to the reverse of the first half-reaction (see Scheme 3), there are some differences in the individual
energies between the two. For example, the barrier from Int9 to Int10 via TS5 is 15.5 kcal/mol, while
the corresponding barrier in the reverse direction of the first half-reaction,
that is, from Int4 to Int3 via TS2, is 19.7 kcal/mol.

The experimentally measured kcat for
the formation of DAPG is 1.2 s–1,2a which corresponds to a barrier of ca 17 kcal/mol. In the
present study, the protonation of the first substrate (Int3 → [TS2] → Int4, Scheme 3) and the deprotonation
of C6–H of the second substrate (Int9 →
[TS5] → Int10) are the rate-limiting
steps of the first and second half-reactions, respectively, with calculated
barriers of 17.9 and 19.5 kcal/mol, respectively. The calculated rate-limiting
barrier for the overall reaction is thus 19.5 kcal/mol, which is in
a good agreement with the experimental value.

An important finding
here is that a proton transfer to the forming
alkoxide takes place concurrently with the formation of enzyme–substrate
adducts by either a C–S bond formation in the first half-reaction
(Int1 → [TS1] → Int2) or a C–C bond formation in the second half-reaction (Int8 → [TS4] → Int9). In both cases, the proton source is a hydroxyl group in the ortho-position,
which is C3–OH of the first MAPG substrate and C5–OH
of the second MAPG substrate, respectively. This can be applied to
explain the experimentally observed regioselectivity and substrate
specificity on non-natural acyl acceptors.3a Namely, the enzyme is inactive toward phenol, catechol, or hydroquinonebut
is active on various resorcinol-derived compounds. Thus, at least
two hydroxyl groups are required for the acylation and these two groups
have to be in 1,3-position relative to each other. The acyl group
is exclusively added to the carbon at the ortho-position of one hydroxyl
group and the para-position of the other hydroxyl group. According
to the calculations on the natural reaction discussed above, the para-hydroxyl group is crucial for the reaction, as it is
the key for the formation of the dienone intermediate (Int4 and Int9). The need of the ortho-hydroxyl
group is explained by that a proton source is required for the protonation
of the forming alkoxide in the reaction.

Here, it is important
to mention that a number of alternative mechanistic
scenarios have also been examined in the present study, all of which
were calculated to be associated with high energies. Although negative,
these results provide valuable information for the understanding of
the mechanism and will therefore be described briefly.

According
to the mechanism proposed in Scheme 3, the first step of the entire reaction is
the deprotonation of the para-hydroxyl group (C5–OH)
by Glu116, with Tyr124 acting as a relay. This proton transfer process
is important for the formation of the key dienone intermediate with
a C5=O double bond (Int4) in the first half-reaction.
However, we notice that even without the deprotonation of C5–OH
taking place, a dienone intermediate could still be formed with the
C3=O double bond instead because the C3-hydroxyl group is deprotonated
concertedly with the C–S bond formation (TS1).
We have examined the energetic feasibility of the first half-reaction
without involving the deprotonation of C5–OH (see Supporting Information for details). The calculations
show that the energy of TS1 is very similar, but the
barriers of the following two steps are considerably higher. Very
importantly, the protonation of the aromatic ring (TS2) has a prohibitively high barrier of 24.7 kcal/mol. These results
clearly show that the deprotonation of the para-hydroxyl
group of the substrate in the first half-reaction is prerequisite
for the catalysis.

Another mechanistic scenario that has been
suggested previously
is that His347 is the general base that deprotonates the C5–OH
group5 and not Glu116 as in the proposed
mechanism shown in Scheme 3. In E:S, the proton of the imidazole ring of
His347 is at the Nε nitrogen, engaged in a hydrogen bond to
the C5–OH group. For His347 to act as the base, the proton
must therefore be at the Nδ position. We have optimized the
structure of this tautomer (see Supporting Information), and the energy was found to be ca 15 kcal/mol higher than E:S. This result shows that the scenario of His347 being the
general base can be ruled out.

3.2 Experimental Mutational Analysis
As discussed above, one important prediction from the calculations
is that the remote Asp137 residue acts as the general acid/base in
the rate-limiting protonation and deprotonation of the substrate (Scheme 3). These proton transfer
events are mediated by Thr132 and His144. Replacement of His144 by
alanine or serine has already been shown to eliminate the activity
of the enzyme,5 supporting the suggested
role of this residue.

To verify the role of Asp137, this residue
was exchanged to an asparagine experimentally. Indeed, the resulting
D137N variant did not lead to any detectable product formation (<
0.1%), although the enzyme was successfully expressed in the soluble
form (see Supporting Information for details
on the experiments). This strongly supports the suggested function
of Asp137.

4 Conclusions
In the present work, we
have used quantum chemical calculations
to investigate the mechanism of the Friedel–Crafts reaction
catalyzed by acyltransferase from P. protegens. A very large model of the active site, consisting of more than
400 atoms, was designed on the basis of the crystal structure, and
a detailed energy profile was produced for the acylation of monoacetylphloroglucinol
(MAPG) to diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and phloroglucinol (PG).

The reaction mechanism proposed on the basis of the calculations
is shown in Scheme 3, and the obtained energy graph is given in Figure 3. The overall reaction consists of two half-reactions,
as shown in Scheme 2: (1) the acylation of the enzyme by the first MAPG substrate and
(2) the acyl transfer from the acylated enzyme to the second MAPG
substrate. The calculations show that the second half-reaction follows
the reverse of the first half-reaction in terms of the elementary
steps, with some small differences in the calculated energies and
barriers.

As indicated in Scheme 3, the first step is the deprotonation of the para-hydroxyl group of the substrate by Glu116 (via Tyr124).
This is
demonstrated to be prerequisite for the catalysis because it allows
for the formation of a stable dienone intermediate in the following
steps.

Next, the calculations show that the nucleophilic attack
by Cys88
on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate takes place concurrently with
a proton transfer from the ortho-hydroxyl to the
forming alkoxide. This proton transfer is facilitated by hydrogen
bonding to His56, which rationalizes the previously observed important
role of this residue in the catalysis.5

The involvement of the two hydroxyl groups in the catalysis
helps
thus to rationalize the experimentally observed regioselectivity of PpATase and also its specificity on non-natural acyl acceptor
substrates. It has namely been demonstrated that the substrate has
to bear two hydroxyl groups and they have to be in a 1,3-position.
Also, it has been shown that the acyl group will be added exclusively
to the carbon ortho to one hydroxyl group and para to the other. These
observations are hence consistent with the proposed mechanism.

An important prediction of the calculations is that the Asp137
is responsible for the protonation of the substrate, through a hydrogen
bonding network involving His144 and Thr132. This is very interesting,
considering that Asp137 is located more than 10 Å away from the
substrate. Such long-range proton transfer chains through hydrogen
bonding networks are not uncommon in enzymes. Important examples include
the proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase16 and the activation of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor
in aspartate aminotransferase.17 The involvement
of Asp137 in the reaction was validated by site-directed mutagenesis,
in which the D137N variant was found to be completely inactive.

The rate-limiting step of the overall reaction is calculated to
be the deprotonation of the CH group of the substrate by Asp137 in
the second half-reaction, with a barrier of 19.5 kcal/mol, in good
agreement with the experimental kcat value.

The insights provided by the current calculations are valuable
for the understanding of the required substrate pattern and for the
rational design of PpATase to ensure the maintenance
of the required catalytic machinery during protein engineering, not
only in the first sphere of amino acids around the active site but
also in the second sphere.

The geometries of the barrier-less transition
states were successfully optimized. However, after taking into account
all corrections (large basis set, solvation effect and ZPE), the energies
of these transitions states were found to be slightly lower than the
connecting intermediate(s).
