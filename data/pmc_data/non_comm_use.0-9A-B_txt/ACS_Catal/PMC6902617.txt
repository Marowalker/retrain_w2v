Identification
of active sites in heterogeneous metal catalysts
is critical for understanding the reaction mechanism at the molecular
level and for designing more efficient catalysts. Because of their
structural flexibility, subnanometric metal catalysts, including single
atoms and clusters with a few atoms, can exhibit dynamic structural
evolution when interacting with substrate molecules, making it difficult
to determine the catalytically active sites. In this work, Pt catalysts
containing selected types of Pt entities (from single atoms to clusters
and nanoparticles) have been prepared, and their evolution has been
followed, while they were reacting in a variety of heterogeneous catalytic
reactions, including selective hydrogenation reactions, CO oxidation,
dehydrogenation of propane, and photocatalytic H2 evolution
reaction. By in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ IR spectroscopy,
and high-resolution electron microscopy techniques, we will show that
some characterization techniques carried out in an inadequate way
can introduce confusion on the interpretation of coordination environment
of highly dispersed Pt species. Finally, the combination of catalytic
reactivity and in situ characterization techniques shows that, depending
on the catalyst–reactant interaction and metal–support
interaction, singly dispersed metal atoms can rapidly evolve into
metal clusters or nanoparticles, being the working active sites for
those abovementioned heterogeneous reactions.

1 Introduction
Heterogeneous
single-atom catalysts have attracted tremendous attention
in the field of catalysis in recent years, and it has been shown in
some reactions that single-atom catalysts present superior catalytic
performance than the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts.1−3 The recent progress made in characterization tools on physicochemical
properties has introduced further knowledge for better understanding
catalysis at the atomic level.4,5 By decreasing the size
of metal catalysts down to subnanometric metal clusters and even atomically
dispersed species, the efficiency of a metal could be, in principle,
maximized, and more importantly, unique catalytic behavior may appear
associated with those atomically dispersed metal species.6−9 It has been reported in the literature that, in some reactions,
singly dispersed atoms are the active species, while clusters and
nanoparticles are not.10,11 While in some works, metal clusters
are found to be more active sites than single atoms and nanoparticles.12,13

However, to unambiguously conclude that singly dispersed metal
atoms are the active species in the working catalysts is not an easy
task, which can be reflected in some debates. For instance, Pt single
atoms supported on Al2O3, FeOx, TiO2, and CeO2 are reported to be more
active than Pt nanoparticles for CO oxidation,14−16 while in some
other works, Pt atoms supported on zeolites or metal oxides are claimed
to be less active than Pt nanoparticles.17 Similar issues have also been reported with Au single-atom catalysts
for CO oxidation. Singly dispersed Au atoms have been presented as
efficient catalysts for CO oxidation,18,19 while others
have shown that Au nanoclusters and nanoparticles supported on CeO2 are much more active than singly dispersed Au atoms.20,21 Singly dispersed Pt and Pd atoms on various supports have been reported
as active catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes, olefins,
and ketones.22−25 However, there are some publications showing that single Pd atoms
supported on FeOx show no activity in
the hydrogenation of alkenes, while Pd clusters and nanoparticles
on the same support are active.26

In most of the previous works, the catalytic performances of single
atoms have been usually compared with nanoparticulate catalysts, without
considering the presence of subnanometric metal clusters. As a transition
state between single atoms and nanoparticles, metal clusters show
distinct electronic and geometric structures compared to the other
two entities, and consequently, a different catalytic behavior can
be expected.27,28 Indeed, it has been shown that
subnanometric metal clusters can catalyze reactions that neither the
single-atom nor nanoparticulate counterparts can.29−31 Therefore,
it is necessary to study the size effect of the metal entities on
catalysis by direct comparison of the catalytic performance of single
atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles for establishing a structure–reactivity
relationship. This is most relevant if one takes into account that
metallic species can evolve during reaction conditions. Moreover,
it should be considered that if single-atom catalysts and the nanoparticulate
counterpart are prepared by different methodologies, additional uncertainty
can be introduced into the studies, especially when considering the
complexity of heterogeneous metal catalysts.32,33 Therefore, for a fair comparative study, the model catalysts should
also be better prepared by the same method and the particle size of
the metal species should be controlled by the synthesis parameters.
Nevertheless, their potential evolution under reaction conditions
should be followed that dynamic structural transformation can occur
with atomically dispersed metal species and nanoclusters under reaction
conditions.34,35 This is even more critical if
one takes into consideration that a small fraction of single atoms
or clusters within a supported metal catalyst formed by nanoparticles
can be responsible for most of the catalyst activity. On the contrary,
it may also occur that for some other reactions, a small fraction
of metal clusters or nanoparticles present in the catalysts containing
mainly single atoms contribute most to the catalytic reactivity. Then,
the size of the metal particles and metal–support interaction
will become more important and even determinant for the catalytic
behavior, especially when referring to single atoms.

In this
work, we have prepared by the same method a series of supported
Pt catalysts with particle size ranging from singly dispersed atoms
to clusters to nanoparticles on different supports (TiO2, Al2O3, and CeO2). We have studied
their catalytic performance for a variety of different reactions,
including selective hydrogenation reactions, CO oxidation, propane
dehydrogenation, and photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction.
It has been found that Pt clusters and nanoparticles show higher activity
than Pt single atoms in all the reactions studied. Furthermore, by
in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS),IR spectroscopy, and ex
situ high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR
STEM), we have observed that the structural transformation of single
Pt atoms under reaction conditions depends not only on the nature
of the reactants but also on the material acting as the support. In
other words, metal–reactant and metal–support interactions
not only dictate the geometric and electronic properties of the metal
entities, and therefore the catalytic behavior, but also are determinant
for the evolution behavior of subnanometric metal species under the
reaction conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Pt Single Atoms, Clusters, and Nanoparticles
for Hydrogenation Reactions
First, we have prepared a series
of Pt/TiO2 catalysts by conventional wetness impregnation
(see the Supporting Information for experimental
details), and the size of Pt species supported on TiO2 was
controlled by the Pt loading and the treatments during the preparation
procedure. As shown in Figure 1a,b, Pt single atoms supported on TiO2 (named as
0.03Pt/TiO2-SA with 0.03 wt % of Pt) were directly observed
by HR high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HR HAADF–STEM). After
reduction by H2 at 450 °C, those singly dispersed
Pt atoms agglomerated into Pt clusters of ca. 0.5–1.0 nm (see Figures 1c,d and S1). The average size of Pt particles was found
to be subnanometric when the sample contained 0.1 wt % of Pt (see Figure S2). When the Pt loading was increased
to 0.2 wt %, Pt nanoparticles of ∼1 nm were obtained after
reduction by H2 at 450 °C (see Figures 1e,f and S3). When
the Pt loading was further increased to 0.5 wt %, Pt nanoparticles
of ∼1.5 nm were formed on TiO2 (see Figure S4). These STEM images suggest that Pt
clusters and nanoparticles with good dispersion and narrow size distributions
can be generated on TiO2 and that their particle size can
be tuned by Pt loading and reduction treatment. Therefore, we can
use these Pt/TiO2 catalysts as model catalysts to study
the size effect on their catalytic properties for different reactions.

The hydrogenation of
3-nitrostyrene was chosen as the first model
reaction to study the catalytic performance of different types of
Pt species because it can be carried out at low temperature to avoid
the potential effect of reaction temperature on the size of Pt particles
and also because its catalytic behavior versus the particle size of
metal nanoparticles has been widely reported.36−39 As shown in Figure 2, the Pt single atoms show
negligible activity. It should be mentioned that Pt single atoms supported
on TiO2 remain stable after the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene
(see Figure S5), indicating the stability
of single Pt atoms under mild reaction conditions. In the case of
Pt/TiO2 catalysts containing a large fraction of metal
atoms within the subnanometric clusters of ca. 0.4–0.8 nm (the
0.03%Pt/TiO2-450H2 and 0.1%Pt/TiO2-450H2 samples), the activity is significantly higher
than the samples formed by Pt single atoms. Further increasing the
Pt particle size to ∼1 nm will result in a higher intrinsic
activity for chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene to 3-aminostyrene,
with a turnover frequency (TOF) of ∼2600 h–1, which is higher than any other catalyst reported so far in the
literature at the same temperature and H2 pressure. It
should be noted that the TOF values were calculated based on the total
Pt amount in the catalysts, as in the literature.22 Moreover, further increasing the size of Pt nanoparticles
to ∼1.5 nm (the 0.5%Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample)
leads to a drop of the TOF, suggesting that Pt nanoparticles of ∼1
nm formed by 30–40 atoms are the most active species for the
hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene under our conditions.

Figure 2 Catalytic performance
of different Pt species supported on TiO2 for the hydrogenation
of 3-nitrostyrene. Reaction conditions:
0.5 mmol of 3-nitrostyrene, 2 mL of toluene as the solvent, 10 mg
of solid catalyst, 40 °C and 3 bar of H2. High selectivity
to 3-aminostyrene has been achieved for all the Pt/TiO2 samples containing Pt clusters and nanoparticles. The TOF shown
in this figure was calculated based on the total Pt amount in all
the samples.

In our previous work, it has been
proposed that when Pt nanoparticles
were partially covered by TiO2 overlayers, they were the
active sites for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes in Pt/TiO2 catalysts.40 Herein, we have studied
this effect on the 0.2Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample.
With the help of HR HAADF–STEM imaging and electron energy
loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping, we were able to obtain information
on the structure of those small Pt particles (∼1 nm) at the
atomic level. In fact, these techniques are likely the most appropriate
techniques to perform such kind of analyses.41−43 As displayed
in Figure 3, the hemispherical
Pt nanoparticles are surrounded by TiO2 layers and the
exposed surface area for each Pt nanoparticle is less than 1 ×
1 nm (see more EELS mapping results in Figures S6 and S7). In other words, because
of the strong metal–support interaction between Pt and TiO2, only a few Pt atoms are exposed to the reactants, and these
“cluster”-type Pt sites, in the Pt nanoparticles partially
covered by TiO2 overlayers, are the active sites for chemoselective
hydrogenation of nitroarenes.

resolution. (b) EELS mapping of the Ti-L edge in the selected area

areas shown in (b).

Considering that H2 activation is a key step for the
hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, we have measured the H2–D2 exchange to correlate the capability of the
Pt single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles for H2 activation.44 As shown in Figure S8, both the 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA sample containing single Pt
atoms and 0.03Pt/TiO2-450H2 containing Pt clusters
show clearly lower reactivity for H2-D2 exchange
at room temperature than the 0.2Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample containing Pt nanoparticles of ∼1 nm. These results
indicate that Pt nanoparticles show higher capability for the activation
of H2 than single atoms and subnanometric clusters, which
can explain the higher activity of the former for the hydrogenation
of 3-nitrostyrene. It should be mentioned that, in a recent work,
Pd3 clusters are claimed to be much more active than single
Pd atoms and Pd2 dimers for the hydrogenation of alkynes.45 Though the catalytic performance of Pd particles
with larger sizes is not studied in that work, the higher reactivity
of metal particles with multiple atoms than single atoms for hydrogenation
reactions is consistent with our findings in this work.

The
drop in the activity for Pt nanoparticles of ∼1.5 nm
or larger may be related with the electronic interaction between Pt
and the TiO2 support. Lykhach et al. have demonstrated
that the electronic charge transfer between Pt and CeO2 reaches the maximum for Pt nanoparticles of ∼50 atoms.46 In our case, the strong metal–support
interaction between Pt and TiO2 could be dependent on the
particle size of Pt and the coverage of TiO2 overlayers
on the Pt nanoparticles may vary with the particle size of Pt, resulting
in difference in the electronic and geometric structure of Pt species.47 For that reason, Pt particles in the 0.2Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample are much more active than the 0.03Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample containing Pt clusters. Because of
the electronic and geometric factors, the Pt/TiO2 sample
with Pt nanoparticles of ∼1 nm partially covered by TiO2 overlayers shows both high activity and chemoselectivity
for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes, while Pt single atoms and small
Pt clusters are sensibly less active.

To compare the catalytic
properties of different Pt entities on
other supports with weak metal–support interaction, we have
also prepared a series of Pt/Al2O3 samples containing
Pt ranging from single atoms to clusters and nanoparticles. First,
a 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample containing Pt single
atoms was prepared by impregnation according to the literature.48 As shown in Figures 4a,b and S9, only
singly dispersed Pt atoms can be observed in the HR STEM images of
the Pt/Al2O3-SA sample. After reduction by H2 at 200 °C, some of the single Pt atoms agglomerate into
Pt clusters, while there are still some single Pt atoms preserved
in the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 sample (see Figures 4c,d and S10). When raising the reduction temperature
to 300 °C (see Figure S11) and 450
°C (see Figures 4e,f and S12), the fraction of single Pt
atoms in the reduced Pt/Al2O3 decreases and
only very few Pt atoms can still be found in the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 sample. Therefore, the percentage
of Pt single atoms can be modulated by the reduction temperature,
and these Pt/Al2O3 samples can also be model
catalysts for the direct comparison between single Pt atoms, clusters,
and nanoparticles.

types of
Pt species. HR HAADF–STEM images of Pt/Al2O3-SA (a,b) containing only singly dispersed Pt atoms, Pt/Al2O3-200H2 (c,d) containing a mixture
of both singly Pt atoms and Pt nanoclusters, and Pt/Al2O3-450H2 (e,f) containing mainly Pt nanoparticles
and a few singly dispersed Pt atoms.

The chemical states and coordination environment of Pt species
supported on Al2O3 obtained after different
treatments were characterized by XAS. As shown in Figure 5a and Table 1, when the Pt/Al2O3 samples were directly measured by XAS without any treatments, all
the three Pt/Al2O3 samples present oxidized
states as revealed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES),
though the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 and
0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 samples were previously
reduced by H2. The oxidized state of Pt in the two previously
reduced samples should be caused by the reoxidation of Pt clusters
or small Pt nanoparticles when exposed to air after the H2 reduction treatment. The oxidized nature of these samples was further
confirmed by the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
spectra (see Figure 5b). The Pt–O contribution in the Pt/Al2O3 samples may come from O in the Al2O3 support
and the oxygen directly bonded to Pt atoms.48 The presence of Pt–Al contribution in the EXAFS fit results
can be ascribed to the interaction between small Pt particles and
Al2O3.48,49 Interestingly, the
0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 sample almost shows
the same EXAFS spectrum as the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA
sample, though the size of Pt species in these two samples is quite
different, as presented in the above STEM images. A large number of
Pt clusters were observed in the STEM images, while the presence of
these species was not reflected in the EXAFS results (see Table 1 for the fit results).
The absence of Pt–Pt contribution in the EXAFS spectrum of
the directly measured 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 sample could be caused by the complete oxidation of Pt clusters
into PtOx clusters by air. It has been
observed in the literature that PtOx clusters
or small PtOx nanoparticles (<5 nm)
can show similar EXAFS spectra as singly dispersed Pt atoms on metal
oxide supports because of the high degree of disorder of the small
platinum oxide particles.50−52 Notably, when 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 were in situ reduced by H2 before the
XAS measurement, the oxidized Pt clusters or nanoparticles became
partially reduced, as shown in the XANES spectra (see Figure 5c). The presence of Pt–Pt
contribution at 2.7 Å can also be confirmed in the EXAFS spectra
(see Figure 5d) and
by the corresponding fit results. The above XAS results indicate that
subnanometric Pt clusters can be easily oxidized to corresponding
PtOx clusters and that the oxidized species
may show similar feature as the Pt single-atom species in EXAFS spectra
if the sample is measured directly without in situ prereduction treatment.

measured directly. In this case, it was fixed to 0.01.

c The sample was reduced by H2 at a given temperature before

The
importance of utilization of in situ XAS to characterize the
chemical states and coordination environment of supported Pt catalysts
has also been reflected in the case of the Pt/TiO2 sample
containing Pt nanoparticles of ∼1 nm. As shown in Figure S13, when 0.2Pt/TiO2-450H2 was measured directly by XAS without any pretreatment, the
XANES spectrum corresponding to partially oxidized Pt species was
observed. The presence of the Pt–O contribution at ∼2.0
Å in the EXAFS spectrum (Figure S14) of the directly measured 0.2Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample indicated that Pt seemed to be atomically dispersed, which
was inconsistent with the STEM images shown in Figure 1. As discussed above, the reoxidation of
Pt particles by air can cause the transformation of small metallic
Pt nanoparticles into disordered PtOx particles,
which may be inadequately interpreted as singly dispersed Pt atoms.
Notably, after in situ reduction treatment by H2 at 50
°C, significant reduction of PtOx into metallic Pt was observed in the XANES spectrum, and the Pt–Pt
bonding at ∼2.7 Å was also detected in the EXAFS spectrum.
More interestingly, when the prereduction temperature was increased
to 450 °C, a higher contribution of Pt–O bonding was observed
in the EXAFS compared to the spectrum obtained after prereduction
treatment at lower temperatures (see fit results in Table S1). The observation of the increased Pt–O contribution
can be associated with the formation of TiO2 overlayers
on the surface of Pt nanoparticles because of the strong metal–support
interaction.53 On the basis of the EXAFS
characterization results on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/TiO2 samples, we can conclude that because of their high reactivity
with O2, the characterization techniques using in situ
treatment facilities are necessary to obtain reliable information
on the chemical states and coordination environment of supported Pt
clusters or small nanoparticles.

Catalytic Behavior of Pt
Single Atoms Supported on Al2O3 for Hydrogenation
Reactions
First, we have
tested the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. As shown in Figure 6a, similar to the
situation of Pt/TiO2 catalysts, the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample shows negligible activity for the hydrogenation
of 3-nitrostyrene. Similar to the case of 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA,
Pt atoms supported on Al2O3 remain stable after
the hydrogenation reaction under such mild conditions (see Figure S15). In the case of reduced Pt/Al2O3 samples, considerable conversion of 3-nitrostyrene
can be observed and the reactivity increases with the reduction temperature,
which corresponds to the higher percentage of Pt nanoparticles in
the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 catalyst. Although
the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are not chemoselective
for 3-aminostyrene (∼60% selectivity to 3-aminostyrene on all
the three Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, see Figure S16), the ranking of the activity for
the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene is similar to Pt/TiO2 catalysts, indicating that Pt clusters and nanoparticles show higher
reactivity than Pt single atoms.

Figure 6 Catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
for hydrogenation reactions. (a) Hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene with
various Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Reaction conditions:
0.5 mmol of 3-nitrostyrene, 2 mL of toluene as the solvent, 20 mg
of solid catalyst, 50 °C and 3 bar of H2. The product
distributions of the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene with Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Figure S16. (b) Hydrogenation of styrene with various Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Reaction conditions: 1.0 mmol of styrene,
2 mL of toluene as the solvent, 10 mg of solid catalyst, 50 °C
and 3 bar of H2. The TOF in this figure was calculated
based on the total Pt amount in all the Pt/Al2O3 samples.

Because it has been reported in
the literature that singly dispersed
Pt atoms can be used for the hydrogenation of C=C bonds, we
have also tested the reactivity of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
for the hydrogenation of styrene. As can be seen in Figure 6b, singly dispersed Pt atoms
also show negligible activity toward the hydrogenation of C=C
bonds. The Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with agglomerated
Pt species show much higher activity and the activity increases with
the percentage of Pt nanoparticles in the catalyst, indicating that
Pt nanoparticles are more active than single Pt atoms and clusters
for the hydrogenation of C=C bonds.

One may argue that
the single-atom catalysts shown above are not
reduced, although the single-atom Pt catalysts are also usually positively
charged in most of the reported works.23,54,55 We have tried to reduce the Pt single atoms supported
on Al2O3 by NaBH4 and aqueous N2H4 (see the Experimental Section for details).
After such mild reduction treatment, the activity for the hydrogenation
of styrene and 3-nitrostyrene remained in both cases unchanged as
the pristine Pt/Al2O3-SA sample.

From
a mechanistic point of view, the hydrogenation of −NO2 and C=C may follow different reaction mechanisms on
metal catalysts.40,56,57 It has been reported that the hydrogenation of C=C on nanoparticulate
Pt catalysts is a structure-insensitive reaction, while the hydrogenation
of −NO2 is a structure-sensitive reaction. Nevertheless,
our experimental results show that Pt nanoparticles are more active
than Pt clusters and single Pt atoms for the two hydrogenation reactions.
In other words, the above results indicate that singly dispersed Pt
atoms supported on TiO2 and Al2O3 show much lower activity for the hydrogenation of −NO2 and C=C groups.

Taking into account that residual
Cl may be present in the Pt/TiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts when using H2PtCl6 as the
Pt precursor, we have tried to measure
the Pt–Cl bonding interaction in Pt/Al2O3 samples by XANES.58 As shown in Figure S17, the feature corresponding to the
Pt–Cl bond is not present in our samples.59 Furthermore, in order to exclude the influence of Cl, we
have prepared Pt/TiO2 catalysts using platinum(II) acetylacetonate
as the precursor by impregnating it on TiO2. When the sample
is activated in air (350 °C in air) for the decomposition of
the acetylacetonate ligand bonded to Pt, we can obtain a Pt/TiO2 sample containing atomically dispersed Pt species (see Figures S18–S21). Further reduction treatment
at 450 °C by H2 will lead to the agglomeration of
the Pt atoms into Pt clusters or nanoparticles, showing a similar
evolution behavior as observed when using H2PtCl6 as the precursor. When increasing the Pt loading from 0.04 to 0.5
wt %, the size of Pt particles also increases from 0.5 to ∼1
nm. It should be noted that the size of Pt species is smaller in the
Pt/TiO2 samples prepared with Pt(acac)2 than
those prepared with H2PtCl6.

We have tested
the catalytic performance of these Cl-free Pt/TiO2 samples
for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene. As shown
in Figure S22, the initial TOF increases
with the Pt loading, which means the TOF also increases with the size
of Pt particles supported on TiO2. This trend is consistent
with the results obtained with Pt/TiO2 samples prepared
with H2PtCl6, among which the Pt particles of
∼1 nm show the highest activity. Notably, the absolute TOF
values obtained with Pt/TiO2 catalysts prepared with Pt(acac)2 are lower than the Pt/TiO2 samples prepared with
H2PtCl6, indicating that the Pt precursor indeed
has influence on the catalytic performance of supported Pt catalysts.

One may argue that the reduction treatment used in the preparation
procedure may influence the surface properties of the oxide support.
In order to exclude the reduction treatment on the support, we have
prepared a PtNP/TiO2 catalyst by loading colloid Pt nanoparticles
(0.2 wt % of Pt) on the surface of TiO2. In such a way,
Pt nanoparticles can be generated on TiO2 without reduction
treatment. Furthermore, a calcination treatment at 450 °C in
air was carried out with the PtNP/TiO2 sample to remain
consistent with the preparation of the 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA sample
(see Figures S23 and S24).

We have tested the PtNP/TiO2 samples
for the hydrogenation
of 3-nitrostyrene under the same conditions as used in the article.
As shown in Figures S25 and S26, both PtNP/TiO2-air and PtNP/TiO2-450H2 are active, though PtNP/TiO2-450H2 gives a slightly higher initial TOF. Notably, though the
PtNP/TiO2-air sample has been calcined in air, as for the
Pt/TiO2-SA sample, its activity is much higher than the
Pt/TiO2-SA sample containing singly dispersed Pt atoms.
These results confirm the vital role of agglomerated Pt species for
the hydrogenation reaction. Importantly, the selectivity to 3-aminostyrene
is much higher with the reduced PtNP/TiO2-450H2 sample, which should be related to the formation of TiO2–x overlayers on Pt nanoparticles because of strong
metal–support interaction.40

2.2 CO Oxidation Reaction with Pt Single Atoms,
Clusters, and Nanoparticles
CO oxidation is another important
model reaction to study the structure–reactivity correlations
of supported metal catalysts. It has been reported in the literature
that Pt single atoms supported on Al2O3 are
active for CO oxidation. In this work, we have tested the catalytic
activity of Pt single atoms supported on Al2O3 and followed the evolution of Pt single atoms during the CO oxidation
reaction. The presence of singly dispersed Pt atoms is confirmed by
low-temperature IR bands at 2120–2150 cm–1 (see Figure S27), which correspond to
CO adsorbed on cationic Pt atoms.16,17 As shown in Figures 7b and S28, it is found that Pt single atoms agglomerate
into Pt nanoparticles under reaction conditions. Moreover, the size
of the in situ formed Pt nanoparticles also increases with the reaction
temperature from 150 to 325 °C, indicating that Pt species suffer
dynamic structural transformation under CO oxidation conditions (see Figures 7a and S29–S32).

Figure 7 Different types of Pt species supported
on Al2O3 for CO oxidation. (a) Catalytic result
of the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample for CO oxidation
and the evolution
of Pt single atoms to Pt nanoparticles under CO oxidation reaction
conditions. The average sizes of Pt nanoparticles at different reaction
temperatures are shown in this figure. (b) Typical HAADF–STEM
image of the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample after the
CO oxidation reaction, showing the presence of Pt nanoparticles in
the used catalyst. (c) Comparison of the catalytic performance of
Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different sizes, ranging
from single atoms to clusters to nanoparticles. (d) TOF values of
different Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the low-temperature
range (150–225 °C) for the CO oxidation reaction. The
TOF in this figure was calculated based on the total Pt amount in
all the Pt/Al2O3 samples.

The structural transformation of Pt single atoms into Pt nanoparticles
has also been performed, followed by in situ CO IR spectroscopy. As
displayed in Figure 8, the formation of Pt nanoparticles after the CO + O2 reaction
at 225 °C can be identified by the CO adsorption bands at 2075–2050
cm–1. The CO IR band at 2075 and 2050 cm–1 corresponds to CO adsorbed on terrace and corner Pt sites, respectively.
Interestingly, after the CO oxidation reaction at higher temperature
(325 °C), the contribution of CO adsorbed on corner Pt sites
increases, implying that a surface reconstruction or disintegration
of Pt nanoparticles into smaller particles occurs at high reaction
temperature, which is consistent with our previous study on Pt particles
confined in zeolite.34 The structural transformation
behavior of Pt nanoparticles also indicates that the CO oxidation
reaction is a structure-sensitive reaction and the active sites could
be varied at different working temperatures.

Figure 8 Evolution of Pt single
atoms under CO oxidation reaction conditions,
followed by in situ CO IR spectroscopy. The pristine 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample containing singly dispersed Pt atoms
shows negligible absorption of CO at room temperature because of the
weak adsorption of CO on cationic Pt atoms. After the CO oxidation
reaction at 225 and 320 °C, typical CO adsorption bands on Pt
nanoparticles can be observed, indicating the agglomeration of Pt
single atoms into nanoparticles under reaction conditions, which is
consistent with the images obtained by electron microscopy.

The sintering of single Pt atoms into Pt clusters
and nanoparticles
is confirmed by in situ XAS. As shown in Figure 9a, the white line intensity of Pt-edge XANES
decreased gradually in the CO + O2 atmosphere when increasing
the reaction temperature from 25 to 225 °C, indicating the reduction
of Pt single atoms under reaction conditions. Furthermore, according
to the |FT| of Pt-edge EXAFS spectra (see Figure 9b and Table 2), a new contribution at 2.7 Å can be associated
with Pt–Pt bonding, suggesting the transformation of singly
dispersed Pt species into agglomerated Pt particles, which has also
been observed in a very recent publication.60 In order to compare the reactivity of Pt single atoms, clusters,
and nanoparticles, we have tested the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for CO oxidation on different types of Pt species generated
by controlled reduction treatment. As shown in Figure 7c,d, both Pt clusters and Pt nanoparticles
show significantly higher TOFs (normalized to the amount of Pt atoms
in the catalyst) than Pt single atoms. 0.2Pt/Al2O3-300H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 samples show similar activity, while 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 shows intermediate activity between
these two samples. It should be mentioned that the TOF values shown
in Figure 7d are calculated
based on all the Pt species in the catalyst. If we calculate the TOF
based on surface-exposed atoms, then Pt clusters and nanoparticles
may show even higher TOF, while the TOF for Pt single atoms will remain
unchanged. On the basis of the catalytic results shown in Figure 7 and the size distribution
of Pt species in various Pt/Al2O3 samples, it
can be concluded that the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample
with a higher fraction of single Pt atoms shows lower activity for
CO oxidation than Pt nanoparticles and clusters supported on Al2O3.

are presented as dashed red curves in (b).

measured directly. In this case, it was fixed to 0.01.

b The sample was directly measured
by XAS without any treatment.

c The sample was treated under CO
+ O2 conditions at a given temperature before the XAS measurement.

We have also observed that
the average size of Pt nanoparticles
in Pt/Al2O3-SA after the CO oxidation reaction
is larger than those in the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-300H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 samples
after being used for the CO + O2 reaction (see Figures S33–S36). As discussed above,
Pt single atoms are not stable in the CO + O2 atmosphere
and they agglomerate to Pt nanoparticles probably through an Ostwald
ripening mechanism, in which single Pt atoms migrate to the Pt clusters
or nanoparticles to form larger particles. In the case of 0.2Pt/Al2O3-300H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 samples, Pt clusters or small nanoparticles
are stabilized by the Al2O3 support and the
Ostwald ripening process under CO oxidation reaction conditions is
not as significant as in the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA
sample. This structural transformation behavior can be related to
the stability of different Pt species under CO oxidation reaction
conditions and to the fact that Ostwald ripening tends to occur between
particles of different sizes.61−63

Catalytic Behavior of Pt
Single Atoms Supported on TiO2 and CeO2 for
CO Oxidation
In the case of 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA, a
similar agglomeration behavior from single atoms to
nanoparticles is observed during the CO oxidation test (see Figures 10a,b and S37). Then, we have compared the activity of
Pt clusters and nanoparticles with that of single Pt atoms. As shown
in Figure 10c, Pt
clusters show the highest TOF value, followed by Pt nanoparticles.
Similar to the situation with 0.2Pt/Al2O3 samples,
Pt single atoms supported on TiO2 exhibit the lowest TOF.
It should be noted that the variation tendency of CO oxidation activity
versus Pt particle size is different on Al2O3 and TiO2, implying that the reactivity of different types
of metal entities may depend on the support. In the case of Pt/CeO2 containing single Pt atoms (0.2Pt/CeO2-SA, see Figure S38), the activity is quite low, which
is in line with the reported work.16 After
the CO oxidation reaction with 0.2Pt/CeO2-SA, the agglomeration
of Pt atoms into clusters or nanoparticles has not been observed (see Figures 10d,e and S39), implying that Pt atoms are stabilized by
CeO2 under reaction conditions. The behavior of Pt atoms
supported on CeO2 is dramatically different from that of
Pt atoms supported on Al2O3 and TiO2, suggesting that the evolution behavior of Pt single atoms also
depends on the interaction between Pt and the support. In any case,
while single Pt atoms are stable on CeO2, they are not
active for the CO oxidation reaction. Afterward, as done before, the
0.2Pt/CeO2-SA sample was reduced by H2 at 500
°C to generate Pt nanoparticles of 1–2 nm on CeO2 (see Figure S40). As shown in Figure 10f, the 0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2 sample exhibits much higher activity than
0.2Pt/CeO2-SA, which is consistent with a very recent publication.64 Those Pt nanoparticles of 1–2 nm in the
0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2 sample remained stable after
the CO + O2 reaction (see Figure S41). The above results suggest that for low-temperature CO oxidation
reaction, Pt clusters and nanoparticles are more active than Pt single
atoms on Al2O3, TiO2, and CeO2. Furthermore, the reactivity of Pt clusters and nanoparticles
and the evolution behavior are strongly relevant to the support, implying
the importance of considering the role of the support when discussing
the catalytic behavior of heterogeneous single-atom catalysts.65,66

on TiO2. (b) STEM image of the 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA
catalyst after the CO oxidation reaction, showing the transformation

conditions. (c) Comparison of the activity of Pt single atoms, clusters,
and nanoparticles for low-temperature CO oxidation. (d) HR STEM image
of fresh 0.2Pt/CeO2-SA sample. Because of the low contrast
between Pt single atoms and CeO2, it is difficult to visualize
Pt single atoms. Nevertheless, neither Pt nanoparticles nor clusters
are observed in this sample, implying that Pt species are atomically
dispersed on CeO2. (e) STEM image of the 0.2Pt/CeO2-SA catalyst after the CO oxidation reaction. Pt nanoparticles
are not found in the used catalyst. (f) Comparison of the activity
of Pt single atoms (0.2Pt/CeO2-SA) and nanoparticles (0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2) for CO oxidation.

The higher capability for O2 activation on the 0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2 sample is confirmed by in situ IR experiments.
As presented in Figure S42, peroxide species
can only be detected on the 0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2 sample containing Pt nanoparticles but not on the 0.2Pt/CeO2-SA sample. The activation of O2 on the metal/ceria
catalyst has been proposed to occur at the interface between metal
nanoparticles and ceria, with the participation of oxygen vacancies,
which is verified by the presence of Ce3+ in the X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum of the reduced 0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2 sample (see Figure S43).67,68 The IR results imply that O2 activation
is facilitated at the interface between Pt nanoparticles and CeO2 rather than between Pt single atoms and CeO2,
which can explain why the 0.2Pt/CeO2-500H2 sample
is more active for CO oxidation. It has been shown by both experimental
and theoretical studies that Cu nanoparticles are more active than
Cu single atoms or clusters for O2 activation.69,70 Although the metal element (Cu) studied in the above reports is
different, taking into account the catalytic results presented here,
one could make the hypothesis that if multiple metal atoms are required
for O2 activation, it may also be applied to Pt. Nevertheless,
the adsorption of CO behavior on Pt species could also be related
to the particle size.71

In summary,
the results presented above in this work indicate that
single Pt atoms may evolve into Pt clusters or nanoparticles under
CO oxidation reaction conditions if the interaction between Pt atoms
and the support is not strong enough. Moreover, regardless of the
reducibility of the support, the agglomerated Pt species (clusters
or nanoparticles) are more active than the Pt single atoms on Al2O3, TiO2, and CeO2. It should
be noted that the active sites and the kinetically relevant steps
on support Pt catalysts may vary with the support and the reaction
conditions.72−74 Considering the complexity of the reaction mechanism
for the CO oxidation reaction and its dependence on the size and the
support material, the reasons that cause the different catalytic behavior
of single Pt atoms and the corresponding agglomerates are not in the
scope of this study, which requires more systematic investigations
in the future.

2.3 Propane Dehydrogenation
with Pt Single Atoms,
Clusters, and Nanoparticles
It has been reported that propane
dehydrogenation to propylene is a structure-sensitive reaction, in
which the activity on Pt nanoparticles increases when decreasing the
particle size in the range of 1–9 nm.75 Recently, Xiong et al. have reported the application of single-atom
Pt/CeO2 and Pt–Sn/CeO2 catalysts for
the propane dehydrogenation reaction, and it has been found that singly
dispersed Pt atoms can undergo agglomeration into Pt or PtSn clusters
under the reaction conditions.76 It is
hence not clear how Pt single atoms perform when compared to Pt clusters
and nanoparticles for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Herein, the reactivity of different types of Pt species supported
on Al2O3 has also been tested. As shown in Figure 11, the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample is initially active for the catalytic
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, although the activity is
low. However, a drop of activity is observed in the starting stage,
and then the propane conversion increases again. These changes on
reactivity imply that Pt species may undergo structural transformation
under reaction conditions. Indeed, we have measured the used 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA sample after the propane dehydrogenation
reaction, and the formation of a large fraction of Pt nanoparticles
is confirmed by electron microscopy (see Figure S44). Furthermore, the catalytic performance of 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 for the propane dehydrogenation reaction
has also been measured, and as can be seen in Figure 11, the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
that contain Pt clusters and nanoparticles in the starting catalysts
are initially more active than Pt single atoms. Interestingly, a decrease
in activity and a subsequent activity recovery have also been observed
with both 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2. According to the STEM images
of the used catalysts, the particle size of Pt species increases slightly
compared to that of the corresponding pristine 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 samples (see Figures S45 and S46), suggesting a slight sintering
of Pt species in these two catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation
reaction. Therefore, it can be speculated that Pt nanoparticles with
larger size than those in the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 sample may be more active. Following that hypothesis, 0.2Pt/Al2O3-SA was reduced by H2 at 600 °C
to form a 0.2Pt/Al2O3-600H2 sample,
in which a larger amount of Pt clusters and nanoparticles are formed
compared to the 0.2Pt/Al2O3-200H2 and 0.2Pt/Al2O3-450H2 samples (see Figures S47 and S48). The catalytic results shown in Figure 11 clearly indicate that a higher percentage
of Pt clusters and nanoparticles of ∼1 nm can give higher activity
for the propane dehydrogenation reaction and the propane conversion
keeps decreasing with time on stream. On the basis of the above results,
it can be concluded that Pt single atoms supported on Al2O3 are active but not stable for the propane dehydrogenation
reaction, probably because of the sintering of single atoms to clusters
and nanoparticles in the reductive atmosphere, while Pt clusters and
nanoparticles are more active than Pt single atoms.

Pt atoms in the catalyst. Reaction conditions: 140 mg of solid catalyst,
mixture of propane and N2 as the feed gas (5 mL/min of
propane and 16 mL/min of N2) at 600 °C.

2.4 Photocatalytic H2 Evolution with
Pt Single Atoms, Clusters, and Nanoparticles
In the above
examples, conventional heterogeneous catalysis involving activation
of small molecules was employed to study the catalytic behavior of
different types of Pt species. Pt is also widely used for photocatalysis,
in which Pt is usually thought to serve as the cocatalyst. The photogenerated
electrons in the semiconductors will transfer to Pt sites, which catalyze
the half reaction between protons and electrons to form H2.77 It has been reported in the literature
that the size of Pt cocatalysts has significant influence on the photocatalytic
reactivity because of their size-dependent electronic structures.78,79 Recently, it has been reported that single-site-based metal catalysts
can also be used for photocatalysis.80,81 In the following
example, we have studied three Pt/TiO2 catalysts with different
sizes of Pt species for photocatalytic H2 evolution from
ethanol–H2O mixture under UV light.

As shown
in Figure 12, all
three Pt/TiO2 catalysts are active for the photocatalytic
H2 evolution reaction and the 0.03Pt/TiO2-450H2 sample containing Pt clusters shows the highest activity,
while the other two samples show similar activity. The three used
Pt/TiO2 catalysts after the photocatalytic reaction have
also been measured by STEM. As presented in Figure 13, a large fraction of Pt nanoparticles and
some Pt clusters can be found in the 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA sample,
implying the sintering of singly dispersed Pt atoms under the photocatalytic
reaction conditions. In the case of the other two samples, slight
sintering is also observed, implying the instability of Pt species
during the photocatalytic process under UV light. On the basis of
the above results, it can be concluded that Pt clusters and nanoparticles
show higher activity when working as cocatalysts for the photocatalytic
H2 evolution reaction. Furthermore, singly dispersed Pt
atoms on TiO2 are not stable under the photocatalytic conditions,
and their sintering behavior may be associated with the surface reaction
(oxidation of ethanol by photogenerated holes and the reduction of
H+ to H2 by photogenerated electrons) under
UV light irradiation.

Figure 12 Catalytic performance of Pt single atoms, clusters, and
nanoparticles
supported on TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 evolution
under UV light. The same amount of solid Pt/TiO2 catalysts
was used as the catalyst, and the H2 evolution rate was
normalized to the Pt mass in different catalysts.

0.2Pt/TiO2-450H2. Pt clusters and nanoparticles
are formed in the 0.03Pt/TiO2-SA sample after the photocatalytic
H2 evolution reaction. In the other two cases, the size
of Pt clusters and nanoparticles also slightly increases, indicating
the instability of Pt species under the photocatalytic reaction conditions.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the results presented in this work demonstrate that
when studying the catalytic properties of highly dispersed heterogeneous
metal catalysts containing subnanometric metal species (single atoms
or clusters) or small nanoparticles of ∼1 nm, it is critical
to characterize the coordination environment of the metal entities
by the combination of adequate ex situ and in situ characterization
techniques. Furthermore, in terms of single-atom catalysts, the evolution
of the atomically dispersed metal species under reaction conditions
should also be carefully followed by in situ electron microscopy or
spectroscopy techniques, in order to verify the nature of the active
sites under reaction conditions. Our results suggest that in a variety
of reactions, single atoms can sinter into clusters or nanoparticles
during the reaction, and the evolution behavior depends on the metal–support
and metal–reactant interactions. Nevertheless, we have found
that a small portion of metal clusters or nanoparticles present together
with the single-atom species can contribute to the reactivity in a
dominant manner, indicating the importance of performing an appropriate
comparison between different types of metal entities (from single
atoms to clusters and nanoparticles).
