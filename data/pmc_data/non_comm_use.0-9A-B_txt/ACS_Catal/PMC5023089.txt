The synthesis and application of
[Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(CO)(H)(Br)] and [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(H)2(CO)] as catalysts for
the homogeneous hydrogenation of aldehydes
is described. These systems were found to be among the most efficient
catalysts for this process reported to date and constitute rare examples
of a catalytic process which allows selective reduction of aldehydes
in the presence of ketones and other reducible functionalities. In
some cases, TONs and TOFs of up to 80000 and 20000 h–1, respectively, were reached. On the basis of stoichiometric experiments
and computational studies, a mechanism which proceeds via a trans-dihydride intermediate is proposed. The structure
of the hydride complexes was also confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

Introduction
Efficiency and selectivity
constitute decisive factors in the development
of sustainable chemical processes, especially regarding industrial
large-scale applications. Within this context, the catalytic reduction
of carbonyl compounds using molecular hydrogen represents a green
and economical method to access valuable alcohols for the production
of a large number of fine and bulk chemicals.1 Over the last few decades, a wide variety of highly productive homogeneous
catalysts based on noble metals have been developed for this purpose.
However, the selective hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds over other
reducible functional groups is still a challenging task. Although
significant progress has been made concerning the selective reduction
of carbonyl groups in the presence of C=C double bonds,2 only few examples of catalysts are known which
exhibit full selectivity for aldehydes over ketones. In particular,
such reactions are important for the production of flavors,3 fragrances,3 and pharmaceuticals.4 Very recently, Dupau and co-workers reported
a general and highly efficient method for the chemoselective base-free
ruthenium-catalyzed hydrogenation of aldehydes in the presence of
ketones. By using the ruthenium complex [Ru(en)(dppe)(OCOtBu)2] (Chart 1), a variety of different ketoaldehydes could by hydrogenated,
reaching turnover numbers of up to 40000.5 Surprisingly, apart from some quite less effective examples,6 this system remains the only example of a noble-metal-based
homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst which allows selective reduction
of aldehydes in the presence of ketones.

for the Chemoselective Reduction of Aldehydes5,11−13
However, it is a major attractive goal to replace scarce,
toxic,
and expensive noble metals by environmentally friendly and abundant
first-row transition metals.7,8 Among them, iron appears
to be one of the most attractive alternatives.9 In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the development
of iron-based hydrogenation catalysts.10 Interestingly, some of these systems proved to be selective for
the reduction of aldehydes in the presence of other carbonyl moieties.11−13 In 2013, Beller and co-workers reported on an Fe(II) tetraphos system
(Chart 1) which represents
the first example of a homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst exhibiting
full chemoselectivity for the reduction of aldehydes.11 Various substrates including aromatic, aliphatic, and α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes could be efficiently converted into the corresponding primary
alcohols, while other carbonyl moieties such as ketones and esters
were not reduced. Turnover numbers up to 2000 could be achieved at
140 °C and a hydrogen pressure of 40 bar. Even higher TONs were
obtained by the group of Milstein using an Fe(II) hydrido carbonyl
pincer complex (Chart 1).12 This complex was found to be highly
active also for the hydrogenation of ketones, while its performance
in the reduction of aldehydes was only modest.10g However, by employing NEt3 as an additive in
the reaction, the efficiency of this system could be significantly
increased and TONs of up to 4000 were obtained for several substrates
under 30 bar of H2 and a reaction temperature of 40 °C.
Interestingly, enhanced productivity was also observed in the presence
of a large excess of acetophenone, which, however, was found to be
unaffected under these conditions. Although briefly mentioned, no
further investigations on the chemoselectivity of this catalyst have
been provided. More recently, Hu et al. developed a general method
for the chemoselective hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of
aldehydes by using a similar iron(II) pincer complex supported by
a 2,6-bis(phosphinito)pyridine ligand (Chart 1).13 This reaction
takes place under very mild conditions (4–8 bar of H2, room temperature), although high catalyst loadings (5–10
mol %) were required to obtain the primary alcohols in reasonable
yields. However, it was remarkable that this reaction did not proceed
via a bifunctional mechanism: i.e., involving the pincer ligand.9d

Within this context, our group recently
reported on the synthesis
and reactivity of iron hydride complexes containing PNP pincer ligands
based on a 2,6-diaminopyridine scaffold (Chart 2).14 In these
ligands the aromatic pyridine ring and the phosphine moieties are
connected via N-H or N-methyl linkers.
The advantage of these ligands is that both substituents on the phosphine
and amine sites can be systematically varied in a modular fashion,
which has a decisive effect on the outcome of the reactions. Complexes
featuring at least one N–H spacer in the ligand backbone efficiently
catalyze the hydrogenation of ketones under mild conditions.

Chart 2 Iron Hydride
Complexes Based on the 2,6-Diaminopyridine Scaffold
(R = iPr)
On the basis of detailed experimental and computational
studies
it could be shown that this reaction proceeds via an inner-sphere
mechanism in which the catalytically active species is formed by deprotonation
of the N–H group. In accordance with the proposed mechanism,
no reaction took place when the complex [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(CO)(H)(Br)] (2), which is not capable
of this kind of metal–ligand cooperation, was tested. Surprisingly,
aldehydes could still be reduced with this complex under the same
reaction conditions, thus pointing to an alternative reaction mechanism
which allows complete chemoselectivity of aldehydes over ketones.
However, these results were just preliminary and the way in which
complex 2 is able to promote this reaction remained unclear.
In this paper, we provide a detailed catalytic and mechanistic study
for the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes using complex 2, which was found to be the most efficient iron-based hydrogenation
catalyst reported to date, displaying unprecedented high turnover
numbers surpassing even those of noble-metal catalysts.

Results and Discussion
The monohydride complex [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(CO)(H)(Br)] (2) was prepared as described previously
by the reaction of [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(CO)(Br)2] (1) with Na[HBEt3] (1.1 equiv) in
THF (Scheme 1). With
this procedure typically two isomers were formed.14 The major isomer of 2, with the hydride ligand
being trans to the bromide ligand, could be isolated in pure form
in 68% isolated yield.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Complexes 2 and 3 (Mixture
of Cis and Trans Isomers)
Interestingly, by using 2 equiv of Na[HBEt3] the corresponding
iron(II) dihydride complexes 3 are obtained, which exist
of a mixture of cis (major) and trans isomers (minor) in an approximate
ratio of 1.0:0.7 (Scheme 1). These new complexes could be isolated in 56% yield and
were fully characterized by a combination of elemental analysis and 1H, 13C{1H}, and 31P{1H} NMR and IR spectroscopy. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum displays two signals at 191.1 and 189.2 ppm for the
cis and trans isomers, respectively. In the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum two triplets centered at 224.7 and 219.5 ppm were
observed for the carbonyl ligands, while only one mutual strong band
at 1880 cm–1 was found for the CO vibration in the
IR spectrum. In the 1H NMR spectrum, trans-3 exhibits a sharp triplet at −8.76 ppm (JPH = 42.9 Hz) while a broad signal centered
at −13.02 ppm is observed for cis-3 due to fast interchange of the two hydride ligands. This could be
proved by recording NMR spectra at variable temperatures in THF-d8 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra of complexes 3 (300 MHz, THF-d8, hydride region).
Complex cis-3 gives rise to signals
at −8.82 (HA) and −17.64 ppm (HB) at −50 °C. At this temperature the signal of HA is superimposed with that of the hydrides of trans-3 (−8.76 ppm).

Upon cooling, the broad signal originating from the cis isomer
starts to split into two separate triplets centered at −8.82
and −17.64 ppm, respectively, while the evolution of a single
triplet resonance was observed at higher temperatures. In addition,
all iron hydride complexes described above could be crystallized and
their solid-state structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.

Alternatively, the iron dihydride
could also be prepared in situ
by the reaction of complex 2 with tBuOK
(1.1 equiv) under an atmosphere of H2. Since 2 is not capable of activating dihydrogen in a bifunctional manner,
the formation of 3 likely involves intermolecular cleavage
of H2 with support of the iron center and the external
base. The rate of hydrogen cleavage strongly depends on the solvent.
Immediate formation of 3 was observed in EtOH (1 bar
of H2), while the same reaction carried out in THF required,
even under a hydrogen pressure of 5 bar, up to 3 days in order to
achieve complete conversion.

Scheme 2 Reaction of 3 with Benzaldehyde
in C6D6
Stoichiometric experiments revealed that 3 readily
reacts with aldehydes. Again, significant differences were observed,
depending on the choice of the solvent. The addition of 1 equiv of
benzaldehyde to a solution of the iron dihydride in an aprotic solvent
(Scheme 2) resulted
in the formation of a new iron hydride species, which was, however,
present only in small concentrations. This new compound, exhibiting
a characteristic triplet resonance at −23.55 ppm (JPH = 55.5 Hz) in the hydride region of the 1H spectrum together with a singlet at 164.9 ppm in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum, was identified as the alkoxide complex 4 generated by the insertion of the aldehyde into one of the
metal–hydride bonds of 3 (Figure 4). The intensity of this signal did not change
over time but grew with an increase in the amount of added substrate.
Thus, addition of up to 20 equiv of aldehyde was necessary to observe
complete conversion of the iron dihydride. Moreover, no reaction took
place when the solution of the in situ generated hydrido alkoxide
complex was exposed to dihydrogen (24 h, 6 bar).

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra
(250 MHz, C6D6,
hydride region) of 3 in the presence of increasing amounts
of benzaldehyde, showing the formation of the corresponding alkoxide
complex 4.

In contrast to this, the iron dihydride immediately disappeared
after the addition of 1 equiv of benzaldehyde when the reaction was
carried out in ethanol (Scheme 3). In this case, two new complexes were observed in the 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectra. The first
complex was again found to be the hydrido alkoxide 4 resulting
from substrate insertion, displaying just slightly deviating chemical
shifts due to the different solvent. The second complex exhibits a
triplet resonance at −26.38 ppm (JPH = 58.9 Hz) in the 1H spectrum which correlates to a signal
at 159.4 ppm in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum and
was identified as a cationic species, in which the alkoxide trans
to the hydride is replaced by a solvent molecule (4′).
This complex could be independently synthesized by treatment of 2 with silver salts in ethanol. Purging this mixture with
dihydrogen led immediately to the re-formation of the iron dihydride 3. These findings strongly indicate that the use of a protic
solvent is essential for the hydrogenation reaction by labilizing
and solvatizing the alkoxo ligand trans to the hydride. In particular,
this effect appears to be responsible for the irreversibility of the
insertion step by preventing β-hydride elimination of the coordinated
alkoxide. In the same way, the coordination of dihydrogen to the iron
metal center might be facilitated, thus accelerating the rate of H2 activation. It is worth noting that complex 3 did not react with acetophenone, presumably due to the lower electrophilicity
of ketones.

Scheme 3 Reaction of 3 with 1 equiv of Benzaldehyde
in EtOH
The inset gives the hydride
region of the 1H NMR spectra of cis- and trans-3 as well as the akoxide and ethanol
complexes 4 and 4′, respectively,
at room temperature.

Since the reactivity
of a transition-metal hydride is mainly affected
by its coligand in the trans position, we therefore expected that
only the trans isomer is reactive toward aldehydes and that both isomers
are in equilibrium with one another (Scheme 4).15

Scheme 4 Reaction
of 3 with Benzaldehyde in EtOH
See Figure 5.

The cis/trans isomerization was thought to take place
within minutes,
since no exchange could be observed on the NMR time scale (1H–1H EXSY). Thus, another experiment was performed
by adding only 0.5 equiv of benzaldehyde to a solution of 3 in ethanol and the reaction was continuously monitored by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. As depicted in Figure 5, the signal of trans-3 immediately
disappeared and a new signal was found again for the ethanol complex 4′, whereas the concentration of cis-3 remained almost unaffected. In this case, the hydrido
alkoxide complex was not observed, which might be attributed to the
lower substrate concentration in comparison to the previous experiments
(Scheme 4 and Figure 4). As expected, we
observed recovery of the trans-dihydride as a result
of the slow isomerization process, which required several minutes
to again reach its equilibrium state.

(101 MHz, EtOH/C6D6) of 3 before
(red) and over a period
of 30 min after addition of 0.5 equiv of benzaldehyde (black) showing
immediate complete conversion of trans-3 into the ethanol complex 4′ followed by recovery
of trans-3 via isomerization of cis-3 (due to incomplete proton decoupling
the signal of 4′ shows a slight residual coupling
to the corresponding hydride ligand).

On the basis of the observations described above, a simplified
catalytic cycle is depicted in Scheme 5. The precatalyst 2 readily forms complex trans-3 as a result of heterolytic cleavage
of dihydrogen promoted by the iron metal center and the external base.
Substrate insertion proceeds presumably through an outer-sphere mechanism
in which the nucleophilic dihydride directly attacks the aldehyde’s
carbonyl group to give the alkoxide intermediate 4. The
compound is labile, and the alkoxide ligand may be replaced either
by the solvent (ethanol) to form 4′ or by dihydrogen
to form complex 5, which features an η2-H2-bound dihydrogen ligand. Subsequent deprotonation
of the coordinated H2 finally leads to the regeneration
of trans-3 and liberation of the product
alcohol. Intermediate 5 may be also formed by replacement
of the solvent in 4′ by H2. However,
since intermediates 4 and 4′ could
be detected by NMR spectroscopy, the question arises as to whether
or not these species are indeed part of the catalytic cycle or are
merely resting states.

Scheme 5 Proposed Simplified Catalytic Cycle for
the Chemoselective Hydrogenation
of Aldehydes with Dihydrogen To Give Alcohols on the Basis of Experimental
Findings
Accordingly, the reaction
mechanism was explored in detail by means
of DFT calculations.16 In the model used
for the calculations, acetaldehyde was taken as the substrate and trans-3 as the active species. In addition,
an explicit ethanol molecule (solvent) was considered, providing a
proton shuttle and H-bond stabilization of the intermediates. The
free energy profile obtained for the reaction is represented in Scheme 6.17 The mechanism starts with nucleophilic attack of one hydride
ligand of trans-3 to the carbonyl C
atom of acetaldehyde (in A), with formation of an ethoxide
ion that coordinates the metal weakly in a C–H σ complex
(B). This species is further stabilized by an EtOH···OH
bond with the neighboring ethanol molecule. The process is endergonic,
with ΔG = 6.3 kcal/mol, and the corresponding
barrier (ΔG⧧ = 12.0 kcal/mol)
indicates a facile process.

Scheme 6 Free Energy Profile Calculated (DFT)
for the Hydrogenation of Acetaldehyde
by H2, Catalyzed by trans-3
The free energy values (kcal/mol,
solvent corrected, EtOH) are referred to the initial reactants (A), and relevant distances (Å) are indicated.

The second step of the mechanism corresponds to dissociation
of
the C–H coordinated ethoxide, yielding a cationic Fe complex
with one free coordination position (C). The process
has a small barrier of 1.1 kcal/mol and is essentially thermoneutral
(ΔG = 1.0 kcal/mol). The free coordination
position in C may be occupied by three different species.
One possibility is, naturally, a solvent molecule (ethanol) producing
complex 4′ as depicted in Schemes 4 and 5. This is a
facile process with a barrier of only 2.7 kcal/mol and a free energy
balance of ΔG = −2.4 kcal/mol (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Alternatively,
there can be O-coordination of the recently formed ethoxide ion, resulting
in complex H (4) and exhibiting a negligible
barrier (0.2 kcal/mol), being a considerably exergonic process (ΔG = −15.7 kcal/mol). In fact, the alkoxide complex H is 9.3 kcal/mol more stable than the initial reactants,
being by far the most stable intermediate along the reaction mechanism
and, thus, representing the catalyst resting state. Finally, the free
coordination position in C can be occupied by one dihydrogen
molecule, giving rise to formation of the dihydrogen complex E. This process is clearly exergonic (ΔG = −7.8 kcal/mol) and essentially barrierless. The final step
corresponds to the breaking of the H–H bond in the dihydrogen
complex E, with protonation of the nearby ethoxide ion
and regeneration of the dihydride species (in F). This
is a facile process with a barrier of only 0.5 kcal/mol, being largely
exergonic (ΔG = −15.2 kcal/mol). Overall,
the reaction is exergonic with ΔG = −12.7
kcal/mol, and closing the cycle exchanging one ethanol molecule (the
reaction product) with a new acetaldehyde molecule (the substrate),
from F back to A, is slightly endergonic,
with a free energy balance of ΔG = 4.1 kcal/mol.
The highest barrier of the entire process corresponds to substitution
of ethoxide in H by one H2 molecule, in order
to allow the reaction to continue. Therefore, the overall barrier
for the process is the difference between the free energy values of H and TSDE, being ca.
20 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the experimental conditions used
for the reaction. It has to be noted that a similar mechanism was
proposed recently by Yang, albeit for the reduction of ketones rather
than aldehydes.18

Since the preliminary
catalytic reactions were obtained with high
catalyst loadings, more extensive test reactions were performed here
in order to investigate the catalytic performance of complex 2. Initial experiments were conducted in EtOH using 4-fluorobenzaldehyde
as substrate (Table 1). In presence of 0.05 mol % of 2 together with 1.0
mol % of tBuOK, full conversion to the corresponding
primary alcohol was achieved within 30 min at room temperature and
a hydrogen pressure of 6 bar. In accordance with our observations
on a stoichiometric level, no reaction took place in aprotic solvents
such as THF and toluene. A possible transfer-hydrogenation mechanism
in EtOH could be excluded, since the reduction of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde
was not observed in the absence of dihydrogen.

Decreasing
the catalyst loading led to significantly lower reaction
rates. Nevertheless, although a much longer reaction time was required,
full conversion could still be accomplished at a catalyst to substrate
ratio of 1:10000, demonstrating the high efficiency and robustness
of this system (Table 1, entry 2). As expected, the catalytic activity increased dramatically
by applying higher hydrogen pressures. For example, performing the
same reaction at 30 bar reduced the reaction time from 24 h to less
than 1 h (entry 3), and even 73% of the primary alcohol was obtained
at a catalyst to substrate ratio of 1:20000 (entry 9).

The presence
of a strong base appeared mandatory for the reaction
to occur. By comparing turnover frequencies after 1 h, we found that
a certain amount of tBuOK is needed in order to maintain
the catalyst in its active state. When the base loading was reduced
below 1.0 mol %, the initial reaction rates dropped significantly
(Table 1, entries 4–7).
On the other hand, larger quantities of tBuOK also
resulted in lower activity (entry 11). In light of the common sensitivity
of aldehydes toward highly basic conditions, this result might be
attributed to ongoing side reactions of the substrate, which may potentially
cause catalyst deactivation. Therefore, weaker bases were also considered.
At a substrate to base ratio of 1:100, amines such as NEt3 and diisopropylethylamine were not effective, whereas DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene)
was found to be a suitable cocatalyst. Although the catalytic activity
was lower in comparison to that of tBuOK at room
temperature, similar initial turnover frequencies were observed when
the reaction temperature was raised to 40 °C and higher base
loadings did not diminish the catalytic performance of complex 2 (entries 12–14). Even when a catalyst to substrate
ratio of only 1:20000 was used, 73% of the primary alcohol was formed
within 1 h and >99% was formed after the same time when the pressure
was increased to 60 bar (entry 16), which corresponds to a turnover
frequency of more than 20000 h–1.

Finally,
by using this protocol a turnover number of 40000 could
be reached within 16 h (Table 1, entry 17) and, most impressive, on application of a long
reaction time of 48 h full conversion was still achieved at a catalyst
to substrate ratio of 1:80000 (corresponds to 12.5 ppm catalyst loading,
entry 18), which is one of the highest turnover numbers reached for
a selective aldehyde reduction catalyst to date.19

In order to prove the general applicability of 2,
a scope of various substrates has been tested (Table 2). The catalytic experiments were conducted
in the presence of 50–100 ppm of catalyst together with 1 mol
% of DBU at 40 °C and 30 bar of hydrogen pressure, to ensure
quantitative conversion for all substrates in a reasonable reaction
time (16 h). The best results could be obtained for heteroaromatic
substrates and aromatic aldehydes bearing electron-withdrawing halogen
substituents on the phenyl ring, while the reduction of benzaldehyde
and derivatives with electron-donating groups such as 4-anisaldehyde
and 4-tolylaldehyde was slightly slower. Even sterically demanding
as well as aliphatic aldehydes could be reduced quantitatively at
low catalyst loadings. If present, C=C double bonds remained
unaffected, even in the case of challenging α,β-unsaturated
substrates such as cinnamaldehydes or the industrially important citral,
emphasizing the high selectivity of this system. It has to be noted
that the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde did not proceed in the presence
of tBuOK, revealing the benefits of employing DBU
as the base in the reaction. Again, higher turnover numbers could
be obtained by increasing the hydrogen pressure. This was exemplarily
shown for cinnamaldehyde, which was quantitatively converted into
the corresponding primary alcohol at a catalyst to substrate ratio
of 1:20000 at 60 bar of H2.

a Reaction conditions unless stated
otherwise: catalyst 2 (0.1–0.2 μmol, 50–100
ppm), aldehyde (2 mmol), DBU (20 μmol, 1.0 mol %), EtOH (1 mL),
30 bar of H2, 40 °C, 16 h.

b Determined by integration of 1H NMR
spectra.

c Based on integration
of 1H spectra using mesitylene as internal standard.

d Reaction conditions: 60 bar of H2.

Additional tests
were carried out in order to investigate the catalyst’s
selectivity toward other reducible functionalities (Scheme 7). For this purpose, competitive
experiments were performed using an equimolar mixture of 4-fluorobenzaldehyde
and the respective cosubstrate at a catalyst to substrate ratio of
1:5000 with respect to the aldehyde. Gratifyingly, ketones, esters,
epoxides, alkynes, and nitro groups were not hydrogenated and did
also not interfere with the reaction.

Scheme 7 Hydrogenation of
4-Fluorobenzaldehyde in the Presence of Different
Cosubstrates Bearing Other Reducible Functionalities
Since the iron(II) dihydride is supposed to
be a key intermediate
in the catalytic hydrogenation, we finally conducted a series of test
reactions in which the isolated complex 3 was directly
used as the catalyst (Table 3). In this case, the addition of an external base was not
required. Using cinnamaldehyde as the substrate resulted in full conversion
to the corresponding primary alcohol at a catalyst loading of 0.5
mol % within 1 h (30 bar, room temperature), but no reaction took
place when the amount of 3 was lowered to 0.1 mol %.
This is in accordance with our findings on the influence of the base
loading on the catalytic activity, since the overall basicity of the
reaction solution now exclusively depends on the amount of the product
alkoxide which is initially formed by the insertion of the aldehyde
into the metal–hydride bond. However, quantitative formation
of cinnamyl alcohol was achieved when the same reaction was carried
out in a 2:1 mixture of EtOH and NEt3.

Conclusion
In sum, an inexpensive and robust homogeneous precatalyst and catalyst
using earth-abundant iron, [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(CO)(H)(Br)] and [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(H)2(CO)] (mixture of trans and cis isomers), based on the 2,6-diaminiopyridine
scaffold where the PiPr2 moieties of the
PNP ligand connect to the pyridine ring via NMe spacers, was developed
and applied to the hydrogenation of several aldehydes to alcohols
in the presence of DBU as base. This methodology proceeds with high
chemoselectivity even in the presence of other reducible functional
groups such as ketones, esters, alkynes, olefins, and α,β-unsaturated
double bonds. The yields and chemoselectivities under mild conditions
are exceptional in comparison with previous iron catalysts and even
noble-metal catalysts. In some cases, full conversion was achieved
even at a catalyst to substrate ratio of 1:80000 (12.5 ppm catalyst
loading). Accordingly, [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(CO)(H)(Br)]
and [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(H)2(CO)]
are some of the most efficient hydrogenation catalysts for this process
to date. On the basis of stoichiometric experimental and computational
studies, a mechanism which indeed proceeds via the trans-dihydride complex [Fe(PNPMe-iPr)(H)2(CO)] is proposed. Thus, the low catalyst loadings (typically
50 ppm), mild reaction conditions (40 °C, 30 bar of H2), the broad applicability, and the mild reaction conditions make
these catalysts and this procedure interesting for the synthesis of
fine and bulk chemicals.3
