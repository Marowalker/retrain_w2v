Discrete
palladium(II) complexes featuring purposely designed phosphine
ligands can promote depropargylation and deallylation reactions in
cell lysates. These complexes perform better than other palladium
sources, which apparently are rapidly deactivated in such hostile
complex media. This good balance between reactivity and stability
allows the use of these discrete phosphine palladium complexes in
living mammalian cells, whereby they can mediate similar transformations.
The presence of a phosphine ligand in the coordination sphere of palladium
also provides for the introduction of targeting groups, such as hydrophobic
phosphonium moieties, which facilitate the accumulation of the complexes
in mitochondria.

==== Body
The functioning
of the cell
is dependent on the regulated action of thousands of enzymes, many
of which require metal cofactors for their activity. In most of the
cases, the metal works either as a Lewis acid or as an electron-transfer
center.1 In recent years, there have been
impressive advances toward the development of artificial metalloenzymes
capable of achieving transformations that do not occur in nature,2−4 with a special emphasis on those promoted by late transition metals.5,6 However, translating these metalloprotein catalysts to living settings
is far from obvious and has only been proved in isolated cases and
in bacterial periplasms.7,8

More success has
been attained with discrete, small transition-metal
complexes that are capable of crossing cell membranes and, thereby,
able to promote intracellular transformations.9−13 This is the case for several ruthenium(II) complexes
that can mediate the uncaging of allyl-carbamate (alloc) protected
amines in living mammalian cells.14−17

Particularly exciting is
the possibility of using Pd catalysts
in biological contexts, because of the well-known transformative power
of palladium in organometallic chemistry.18,19 However, the use of palladium complexes in the complex environment
of living cells is seriously compromised by many issues, including
solubility, stability, biorthogonal reactivity, or toxicity. Therefore,
most applications that have been described so far involve the use
Pd nanostructures or mesostructures, rather than discrete complexes.
Hence, Bradley, Unciti-Broceta, and co-workers have claimed that small
Pd(0) microspheres can induce depropargylation reactions or even Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling in biological settings,20,21 and Chen reported
that freshly made palladium nanoparticles can promote similar reactions.22

Discrete palladium complexes have also
been used, but only sporadically,
and with somewhat differing results. Therefore, Chen and co-workers
have shown that commercial Pd precursors such as Pd(dba)2 and Pd2(allyl)2Cl2 can cleave propargyloxy
groups (poc) in PBS at 37 °C, and even in HeLa
cells.23 However, a recent study by the
Weissleder group reveals that these commercial Pd sources perform
poorly when using standard tissue culture (HBSS and MEM) as reaction
milieu. Remarkably, these authors were able to obtain good yields
in alloc-removing reactions by using bis[tris(2-furyl)phosphine]palladium(II) dichloride as a catalyst,
although stability and solubility issues precluded direct use of the
complex in living settings. This problem was solved by encapsulating
the metal complex within a biocompatible polymer (see Scheme 1).24

Scheme 1 Previous Examples of In Cellulo Uncaging of Poc and Alloc Probes
Mediated by Pd Catalysts and Reactions Described in This Work
The above results raise doubts
on whether discrete palladium complexes
can indeed be used as catalysts in complex biological media and in
living cells. Such small-sized palladium complexes are very attractive,
because of their well-defined nature, and the possibility of manipulating
the ligands to tune solubility, stability, and reactivity properties,
and eventually favor cell transport and intracellular targeting.

Herein, we demonstrate that discrete palladium complexes with designed
phosphine ligands can promote propargyl and alloc cleavage reactions
in cell lysates, and even in living mammalian cells. Importantly,
appropriate engineering of the ligand allows the mitochondria accumulation
of an active palladium catalyst.

Given that previous studies
did not clearly establish the in vitro
reactivity of different palladium sources to cleave propargyloxy groups,
we investigated the catalytic performance of several complexes in
PBS and cell lysates.

In addition to standard commercial species,
such as [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 (Pd1), Pd(OAc)2 (Pd2), and Pd2(dba)3 (Pd3),23−25 we purposely made a series of Pd(II) complexes (Pd4–Pd9) that exhibited designed pyridine,
thioether,
or phosphine ligands (see Figure 1 and pp S3–S8 in
the Supporting Information). In the case of the phosphine-containing
derivatives, we built complexes with neutral (Pd6), anionic
(Pd7), or positively charged phosphonium tethers (Pd8 and Pd9).

Figure 1 (a) Representation of the uncaging reaction
of 1,
and (b) bar diagram representation of the yields obtained for each
catalyst under biological compatible conditions in water, PBS buffer,
and cell lysates. Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol, 1
equiv), Pd (0.02 mmol, 0.1 equiv) in 1 mL, 37 °C, 24 h (mean
± s.e.m, n = 2). (c) Pd catalysts used in this
work for the study of their catalytic performance in biological compatible
media and in living cells. Yields were calculated by RP-HPLC-MS, using
coumarin as an internal standard.

Instead of the typical assay consisting of the cleavage of
a propargylic
carbamate, we studied the depropargylation of phenol derivative 1. We chose this probe because of its good aqueous solubility,
ease of synthesis, and good separation properties by HPLC-MS. Furthermore,
in contrast to standard Rhodamine probes, it presents only one propargylic
appendage, thereby simplifying the analysis.

The reactions were
carried out using a 200 μM solution of
substrate 1 and 10 mol % of the Pd sources in
either water, PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2), or HeLa cell
lysates for 24 h at 37 °C (see Figure 1 and the Supporting Information (pp S9–S13). Pd1 and Pd2,
and the complexes bearing pyridine and methionine ligands (Pd4 and Pd5) provided good yields of 2, in
both water and PBS; however, in cell lysates, the conversion was extremely
low. Likely, these palladium complexes do not survive to the complex
mixture of components present in a cell lysate, and decompose to form
inactive Pd species.26 The palladium complexes
with phosphine ligands Pd6–Pd9 gave
lower conversions in water, with yields ranging from ca. 40% for Pd6 to ca. 15% for Pd7–Pd9, and performed very poorly in PBS, likely because of the low solubility
of the complexes in high-ionic-strength media.

However, complexes Pd6, Pd7, and Pd9 were able to promote
the depropargylation reaction in
cell lysates. Although the yields were low, their performance is better
than that of the other palladium sources (Pd1–Pd5). Possibly, albeit a phosphine ligand is not the best
one from a reactivity point of view, the corresponding palladium complexes
are more stable and can better resist hostile media such as that present
in cell lysates.

We also investigated the ability of these latter
phosphine palladium
reagents to remove alloc protecting groups, which is a process that
likely involves Pd(0) reagents. The uncaging reaction was evaluated
in substrate 3, in the absence or presence of added reducing
agents (see Figure 2a and the Supporting Information (pp S9–S13)). The reactions were performed using 200 μM solutions of 3 in water, 10 mol % of the palladium complexes, at
37 °C, in the absence or presence of 2 mM of NaAsc or 0.4 mM
of GSH, and monitored by high-performance liquid chromatograpy-mass
spectroscopy (HPLC-MS) at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. In the absence of the
additives, the yields were very poor; however, in the presence of
NaAsc, we obtained yields of >50% and >30%, using Pd7 and Pd9, respectively (24 h). With GSH, the reaction
with Pd7 was more efficient, and hence, we observed 60%
yield after 1 h and 94% after 24 h. When the experiments were performed
in the presence of cell lysates, Pd7 and Pd9 led to product yields of 33% and 24% after 24 h.

obtained with catalysts (i) Pd7 and (ii) Pd9 at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h in only water, or with additives: NaAsc (2

1 equiv), Pd complex (0.02 mM, 0.1 equiv) in 1 mL, 37 °C, 24
h), and (c) uncaging reaction in cell lysates (green column) and in
cell lysate +0.4 mM of GSH (red column) promoted by catalysts Pd7 and Pd9. [Reaction conditions: 10 (0.2 mmol,

shows Pd7 and Pd9. Yields were calculated
by RP-HPLC-MS, using coumarine as an internal standard (mean ±
s.e.m., n = 2).

With further additions of GSH (0.4 mM) to the lysate, the
yields
were not very different (24% and 22%, respectively; see Figure 2).

The above results
confirm that phosphine palladium(II) complexes
can promote depropargylation and deallylation reactions in water with
good yields. Although in cell lysates, the efficiency is considerably
lower, we were intrigued to know whether the reactions could be achieved
inside living cells, as the intracellular environment does not necessarily
parallel that of a cell lysate. A key element to take into account
before moving to intracellular reactions is uptake of the potential
catalysts. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)
analysis of cellular extracts (Vero cells), obtained after extensive
washing and lytic treatment, revealed a higher amount of palladium
after the addition of complexes Pd6–Pd9 than of species Pd1–Pd5 (see Figures S12 and S13 in the Supporting Information).
Importantly, cell viability tests (MTT in Vero cells, 24 h) demonstrated
that the phosphine-containing complexes are essentially nontoxic below
50 μM, and some of them can be used even at higher concentrations
(see Figure S14 in the Supporting Information).
While substrate 1 was good for in vitro studies, the
change in fluorescence after the reactions is not strong enough for
an appropriate monitoring in cellular settings. Therefore, we changed
to the propargylated probe 5, which, after uncaging,
generates a product 6 that emits at 635 nm when excited
in the far-ultraviolet (far-UV) region (see Figure 3a).27

Figure 3 (a) Schematic
representation of the uncaging reaction of the propargylated
probe 5, and (b) imaging of the reaction in Vero cells
(the first row represents the red channel; the second row represents
the merger of bright-field and red channels: (i) mock, (ii) Pd6, (iii) Pd7, and (iv) Pd8). [Reaction
conditions: 5 (50 μM) was incubated in DMEM with
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 30 min. Culture medium was removed
and cells were washed twice before addition of the Pd catalyst (50
μM). Cells were then incubated for another 30 min, washed twice,
and observed under the microscope (scale bar = 20 μm).]

The experiments were carried out
by incubation of Vero cells at
a final concentration of 50 μM of the probe 5 in
culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS-DMEM) for 30
min at 37 °C. The milieu was removed, and cells were washed twice
with FBS-DMEM to ensure removal of extracellular probe. Pd reagents
(50 μM) were then added in fresh media (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)), and, after 30 min, cells were imaged by wide-field fluorescence
microscopy.

While in the experiments with Pd sources (Pd1–Pd3 and complexes Pd4 and Pd5),
we observed almost negligible red emission (Figure S15 in the Supporting Information), with species Pd6–Pd8, equipped with phosphine ligands, we detected
strong red emission due to the release of the product 6 inside Vero cells (Figure 3b). The overlap between the absorption of the pyrene unit
in Pd9 and that of product 6 precluded the
analysis of the reaction with this complex. Overall, these results
are consistent with the in vitro studies and confirm that the phosphine
ligands are beneficial for observing “in cell” reactivity,
likely because the complexes present a good balance between reactivity
and stability in the cellular milieu.

Considering the amount
of palladium that was present in cells,
as measured by ICP-MS of cell extracts after extensive washing steps,
and associating the normalized fluorescence intensity with the amount
of product, using calibration curves (see the Supporting Information (p S18)), it is possible to estimate
whether there is some turnover. Indeed, for Pd7, we calculated
an average TON of 10, whereas for Pd8, it is >5, suggesting
that catalytic cycles can operate in cellular settings.

The
cellular reactions can also be carried out in mammalian cells
other than Vero, such as HeLa (see Figure S17 in the Supporting Information). We also checked an inverse protocol
in which cells are first treated with the palladium reagents, and
the probe is added after 30 min, after the corresponding washing steps.
However, in these cases, we did not observe fluorescence, likely because
the palladium complexes, over time, are converted to species that
are not enough active in the depropargylation process.

We next
explored the removal of alloc groups inside living HeLa
cells, in this case, using the caged Rhodamine 110 derivative 7, which is essentially nonfluorescent, but emits green light
after removing the alloc protecting groups. Initial experiments were
carried out by mixing HeLa cells with 7 (50 μM
in FBS-DMEM) for 30 min, 2-fold washing with FBS-DMEM, and addition
of the Pd complexes. After 30 min at 37 °C, cells were visualized
under the microscope. As in the case of the depropargylation reaction,
the complexes Pd1–Pd5 raised only
very low intracellular fluorescence, however, with species Pd6–Pd8, we could observe strong intracellular green
fluorescence (see Figure S18 in the Supporting
Information).

Inverting the order of addition, first the palladium
complexes,
and after 30 min, washing and addition of the probe 7, we detected intracellular fluorescence, but only with complexes Pd8 (see Figure S19 in the Supporting
Information) and Pd9 (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained in Vero
cells (see Figure S20 in the Supporting
Information).

of Pd9 with TMRE in HeLa cells, observed 2 h after incubation
with the palladium complex: (i) blue light emission of Pd9; (ii) red light emission from the mitochondrial dye TMRE; and (iii)

(d) Reaction promoted by Pd7: (i) blue channel, (ii)

of (i) and (ii). (e) Graphical representation of the ICP-MS results
from mitochondrial isolation of fractioned Vero cells using complexes Pd6–Pd9 (see the Supporting Information for details). [Reaction conditions: Pd complexes
(50 μM) were incubated with HeLa cells in DMEM with 5% FBS for
2 h at 37 °C before substrate 7 (50 μM) was
added; the cells were incubated for another 30 min and observed under
the microscope (scale bar = 20 μm).]

In the case of Pd9, the presence of a pyrene
group
in the ligand structure allowed a direct monitoring of the species
in living cells. As shown in Figure 4, the blue emission of living cells after addition
of this complex shows a very good co-localization with the red color
of a mitotracker (Figure 4b, panels (i)–(iii)). This was further confirmed by
ICP-MS analysis of cells lysed under conditions that allowed the isolation
of the mitochondria from the rest of the cytoplasmic mass. As indicated
in Figure 4e, Pd9 presents a substantially higher mitochondrial accumulation
than the other complexes. Likely, the presence of the pyrene and phosphonium
groups in the ligand allows the right combination of charge and hydrophobicity
to favor a significant mitochondrial accumulation of the complex.

Importantly, in cells treated with Pd9, we observed
an efficient transformation of 7 to 8, as
deduced from the very strong buildup of green fluorescence, that also
accumulates in the mitochondria surroundings (Figure 4c, panels (i)–(iii)). Other phosphine-containing
catalysts, such as Pd7 or Pd8, were less
active (see Figure 4d, panels (i)–(iii), as well as Figure S21 in the Supporting Information).

Given the positive
results with the rhodamine alloc probe (7) and Pd8 and Pd9, using the inverse
protocol (palladium complexes added first), we also tested this protocol
with the rhodamine derivative having poc instead of alloc protecting
groups (Rho-poc).23 The results,
which are detailed in the Supporting Information, indicated that, while Pd8 failed to raise significant
fluorescence, Pd9 was able to promote the depropargylation.
This might be associated with a protective effect of the mitochondria
surroundings on the stability of the palladium complex (see Figure S22 in the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
Our results confirm that, while many Pd(0) and Pd(II) sources can
effect depropargylation and deallylation reactions in water and PBS,
they are much less effective in complex cellular media or living cells.
However, palladium complexes featuring designed phosphine ligands
can promote the transformations in cell lysates with variable efficiencies,
which are dependent on the characteristics of the ligands. Despite
this modest activity, these palladium phosphine complexes can be translated
to living mammalian cells and promote both depropagylation and alloc
cleavage reactions.

We have also demonstrated that, using a
phosphine ligand tethered
to phosphonium and hydrophobic pyrene groups, the palladium complex
presents a preferencial accumulation in mithochondria, wherein it
remains active. This type of subcellular targeting might open new
opportunites for promoting enhanced and selective biological effects
in prodrug activation processes. Our results confirm the viability
of engineering well-defined, discrete palladium complexes to promote
relevant reactions in cellular milieu. The small-size and ligand tunability
of these complexes can offer advantages with respect to other alternatives
based on metalloenzymes or nanoconstructs, in terms of simplicity
and synthetic access, as well as of controlling properties such as
reactivity, targetability, and cellular uptake.
