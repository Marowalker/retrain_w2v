We
describe a general theory for surface-catalyzed bimolecular reactions in responsive nanoreactors, catalytically active nanoparticles
coated by a stimuli-responsive “gating” shell, whose
permeability controls the activity of the process. We address two
archetypal scenarios encountered in this system: the first, where
two species diffusing from a bulk solution react at the catalyst’s
surface, and the second, where only one of the reactants diffuses
from the bulk while the other is produced at the nanoparticle surface,
e.g., by light conversion. We find that in both scenarios the total
catalytic rate has the same mathematical structure, once diffusion
rates are properly redefined. Moreover, the diffusional fluxes of
the different reactants are strongly coupled, providing
a behavior richer than that arising in unimolecular reactions. We
also show that, in stark contrast to bulk reactions, the identification
of a limiting reactant is not simply determined by the relative bulk
concentrations but is controlled by the nanoreactor shell permeability.
Finally, we describe an application of our theory by analyzing experimental
data on the reaction between hexacyanoferrate(III) and borohydride
ions in responsive hydrogel-based core–shell nanoreactors.

1 Introduction
Responsive nanoreactors
are an emerging and promising new molecular technology for nanocatalysis
in which catalyst nanoparticles are confined in hollow nanostructures
by permeable shells that can be used to shelter and control the catalytic
processes. In particular, the catalysis can be made selective and
responsive if the shell differentiates among molecules and if the
shell permeability can be modulated by external stimuli.1−14 These nanoreactors can be used for a large variety of applications,
ranging from analytical tools to study chemical reactions1−12 to biosensors for the diagnosis of diseases.10−14 Examples of natural nanoreactors are lipid-based
membranes (e.g., liposomes), cagelike proteins (e.g., ferritins),
protein-based bacterial microcompartments, and viruses.11−13,15 Artificial nanoreactors (based
on spherical polyelectrolyte brushes, dendrimers, ligands, or even
DNA) are simpler than the natural ones and thus are easier to control
for targeted applications.4−12,16,17

In recent years, nanoreactors containing metal nanoparticles
coated with stimuli-responsive polymers have emerged as promising
catalytic systems.4−9,18−21 There are two key roles of the
polymer shell. On the one hand, the shell acts as a carrier that protects
nanoparticles from aggregation and hinders chemical degradation processes:
e.g., oxidation.8 On the other hand, the
polymer ability to switch between states with different physicochemical
properties upon changes in environmental parameters, e.g. temperature,
pH, or concentration of certain solutes, provides a handle to actively
control the nanoreactor’s catalytic properties.

A well-studied
archetypal active carrier system is based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogels.4−8,18−21 Here, the shell is in a swollen
hydrophilic state at low temperature but sharply collapses into a
hydrophobic state above the critical solution temperature.22 Examples of catalytic reactions in aqueous solution
studied in this system are the reductions of nitrobenzene, 4-nitrophenol,
or hexacyanoferrate(III) by borohydride ions6,7,18,19 and the decomposition
of methyl orange under visible light.8

All the aforementioned examples deal with surface-catalyzed bimolecular reactions, a very common type. In the strictly
unimolecular limit (as, e.g., in enzyme kinetics23), a single reactant transforms into a product once in the
proximity of the nanoparticle surface. In this latter case, the total
catalytic rate (reciprocal of the catalytic time) is calculated by
the well-known, exact expression ktot–1 = kD–1 + kR–1, where kD and kR are the diffusion and the surface reaction rates, respectively.6,7,24,25 Unimolecular reactions can be diffusion or surface controlled if kD ≪ kR or kD ≫kR, respectively.
If both rates are comparable in magnitude, the reaction is termed
diffusion influenced. Analogously, a reaction is diffusion or surface
controlled if DaII ≫ 1 or DaII ≪
1, where DaII = ktot/kD is the second Damköhler number.6

As pointed out before,5−7,25 pseudounimolecular surface-catalyzed reactions in
responsive nanoreactors can be described by combining a thermodynamic
two-state model for the polymer volume transition with the appropriate
reaction-diffusion equations. In particular, the important effect
of a change in the local permeability on the reactants approach to
the catalyst’s surface can be described by the theory of diffusion
through an energy landscape,7,25,26 in the spirit of Debye–Smoluchowski diffusion-controlled
rate theory.27−31 This theoretical framework for pseudounimolecular reactions qualitatively
rationalizes the large and sharp variations in catalytic rate observed
in the relevant experiments.6−8,25 To
this end, it was implicitly assumed that bimolecular reactions can
be treated as pseudounimolecular when one of the reactants is in large
excess with respect to the other. This assumption is correct for reactions
in a bulk solution. However, when one considers nanoreactors, care
should be taken, since in these systems it is not the bulk concentration
that matters but the reactant concentration at the nanoparticle surface
where the reaction can take place. The latter is strongly influenced
by the shell permeability , defined as
the product of reactant partitioning and diffusivity,32 and can thus strongly differ from the bulk value. Due to
the responsive nature of the gating shell of nanoreactors, this dependence
crucially implies that the identity of the limiting reactant can switch
upon a change in the external stimulus. As we shall see later, failure
to recognize this fact can lead to very large discrepancies between
the exact and approximate rates.

We provide in this paper a theoretical description of fully bimolecular, surface-catalyzed reactions and, importantly,
how they are connected and controlled to the individual reactant’s
permeabilities. We thus derive more comprehensive formulas of wider
applicability for nanoreactors in comparison to the established unimolecular
expressions. In our general scenario, two species
A and B diffuse toward a catalyst nanoparticle, where they react together
to produce another molecular species, C. Our main result is the following
formula for the total catalytic rate in bimolecular reactions: 1  where  and  are the diffusion rates of the reactants
A and B, which explicitly depend on the shell permeability, . As we will recall later, the
latter is mathematically well defined within diffusion theory.32 This means that, in the general case, the diffusional
mass fluxes of the different reactants are strongly coupled, providing a behavior richer than that arising in the simple unimolecular
case. Only when one of the reactants has a much larger diffusion rate
than the other, kDB ≫ kDA, does the total catalytic time reduce to the sum of the diffusion
and the surface reaction times. kDB ≫ kDA holds depending on permeability and thus on the
nature and state of the nanoreactor shell. We also study the case
in which only one of the species, A, diffuses from the bulk, while
the other species, B*, is created at the nanoparticle surface. We
find that, with a proper redefinition of the diffusion rate, the total
catalytic rate has the same form as in the case when both reactants
diffuse from a bulk solution. In the case of surface-controlled reactions,
our theory converges to the low reactant adsorption limit of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism.33−35 With our theoretical description, we provide a firm
and quantitative analysis of the conditions required for the limiting
pseudounimolecular case to occur and how they are controlled by nanoreactor
permeability, clarifying when such a simplified description is indeed
valid. On the basis of our theory the permeability factor can be extracted
from experiments or, if available from modeling or reference experiments,
used to predict the outcome of nanoreactor reaction experiments.

In the remainder of the paper, we first introduce the theory in Section 2 and then proceed
to discuss key results in Section 3, where we also present its application to the analysis
of experimental data.

2 Theory for Bimolecular Reactions
We study surface-catalyzed bimolecular reactions in so-called yolk–shell
(or “hollow-shell”) nanoreactors, depicted in Figure 1. This hollow spherically
symmetric configuration (see Figure 1c) is the most general we can choose, since it covers
catalytic nanoparticles confined in cavities as well as core–shell
nanoreactors in the limit of zero gap (Rg = R): i.e., no hollow compartment. We consider
the two following scenarios:

Figure 1 Bimolecular reactions in yolk–shell
nanoreactors. (a) Two reactants, A and B, diffusing from a bulk solution,
generate a product, C, in the proximity of a catalyst nanoparticle.
(b) Only the species A diffuses from the bulk, while the species B*
is created at the nanoparticle surface. (c) Schematic representation
of a yolk–shell nanoreactor. A nanoparticle of radius R is embedded in a spherical shell of inner radius Rg and outer radius Rg + d. The shell permeability depends on the diffusivity, Di(r), and
on the transfer free energy profiles, ΔGi(r). We model
both as step functions with values D̅i and ΔG̅i inside and Di0 and zero outside the shell, respectively.

Case 1. Two species A and B diffuse from a bulk solution
kept at constant concentration cA(B)0 toward the catalyst nanoparticle.
A fraction (per unit of time and density of both reactants) of the
reactants arriving at the surface, quantified by Kvol, combine to produce the third molecular species C
(Figure 1a).

Case 2. The species A and B
combine at the nanoparticle surface as in the previous case, but only
the species A diffuses from the bulk solution, whereas the species
B (now denoted as B*) is generated locally at the surface (Figure 1b).



Although it may appear artificial, the second case corresponds
to the common situation where the nanoparticle surface catalyzes the
production of reactive radicals of the species B* close to it: e.g.,
in photochemical reactions.8 These radicals
rapidly decay away from the surface, so that molecules A can only
react with B* in its proximity.

The total catalytic rate, ktot (number of molecules reacting per unit of
time), is equal to the flux of reactants at the nanoparticle surface.
In bimolecular reactions, the fraction of molecules A reacting is
proportional to the number of molecules B at the same location, and
vice versa. Thus, ktot can be also obtained
as 2  where cA(B)(R) are the reactant concentrations at the nanoparticle surface. Equation 2 is the low reactant
adsorption limit of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.33−35 To calculate ktot, we solve the continuity
equation for the density fields of reactants and product 3  where Ji(r) is the flux of the species i = A,
B, C as a function of the distance from the nanoparticle. In their
diffusive approach to the catalyst nanoparticle (or when they diffuse
away from it), reactants (products) have to permeate the shell. The
kinetics of this process is thus governed by the shell permeability,32 which depends on the diffusivity profile, Di(r), and on the thermodynamic
barrier, i.e., the transfer free energy between bulk and shell, ΔGi(r). For
simplicity, we take both profiles to be shell-centered step functions
of width equal to the shell width d (see Figure 1c), i.e. 4  and 5  Here, D̅i and Di0 stand for the diffusion coefficients in the
shell and solution, respectively. ΔG®i represents the mean
interaction between the reactant and the shell (averaged over all
molecular effects36) and as such strongly
depends on the state (swollen/collapsed) of the nanoreactor. Equations 4 and 5 have been previously used as an approximation for spatially
homogeneous gels.4−8,37 Using standard thermodynamic
relations,38 we connect the flux of the
species i to its local concentration ci(r) 6  where μi(r) is the chemical potential
of the species i, and β = 1/kBT, with kB denoting the Boltzmann
constant and T the absolute temperature of the system.
The chemical potential of a molecule interacting with an external
environment with a spatially dependent concentration and free energy
is 7  where ciref is a reference concentration whose value
can be chosen arbitrarily. For ΔGi(r) = 0, eq 6 reduces to Fick’s first law, Ji = −Di∇ci. Using eq 7, we can obtain ΔG®i by measuring the partitioning
of the reactants , defined as
the ratio between their concentrations inside and outside the shell, ciin and ci0, respectively: 8  The partitioning in responsive polymer gels
has been studied by experiment32,39,40 and in terms of computer modeling36,41 and theory.42 With the aforementioned definitions, the shell
permeability is calculated as32 9  We calculate the steady-state distribution of reactants and products
by solving eq 3 with
the appropriate boundary conditions. The full mathematical derivation,
including the boundary conditions we use for both cases studied, is
included in the Supporting Information,
and here we just show the local reactant concentrations at the nanoparticle
surface, r = R. In the case of a
reactant diffusing from a bulk solution with a diffusion rate kDA(B) we obtain 10  and for a reactant B* created at
the nanoparticle surface with a creation rate KB*0 we have 11  with the permeability-dependent cB*0 defined as 12  

The total catalytic rate
is calculated using eq 2, combined with eq 10 for the first case and with eqs 10 and 11 for the second case.
After some algebra (see the Supporting Information) we obtain 13  for both cases studied, i.e. the total catalytic
rate has the same form regardless of the origin of the reactants (bulk
or nanoparticle surface). In the previous expression 14  stands for the surface reaction rate and 15  is the permeability-dependent diffusion rate of the reactant i case
1, whereas for case 2 we need to redefine kDB = KB*0. In the absence of shell, , and the diffusion rate turns
into the Smoluchowski rate27kDi0 = 4πRDi0ci0. For the
yolk–shell configuration depicted in Figure 1c the step profiles in eqs 4 and 5 apply and the
relation between the shell permeability and the diffusion rate, eq 15, simplifies to 16  

3 Results and Discussion
Equation 13 is our main analytical result for surface-catalyzed
bimolecular reactions. It shows that, in the fully bimolecular case,
the diffusional fluxes of the different reactants are coupled. Thus, ktot depends in a nontrivial
way on the surface and the diffusion rates and nanoreactor shell permeability,
in contrast to the simple unimolecular case (i.e., in general ktot–1 ≠ kD–1 + kR–1). We also
find that the total catalytic rate, once the diffusion rate is properly
redefined, is described by eq 13 regardless of the origin of the reactants (bulk or nanoparticle
surface). For this reason, we will jointly analyze the results of
both scenarios. In particular, we examine in detail the conditions
required for the limiting pseudounimolecular case to occur. In addition,
we use our theory to rationalize existing experimental data on the
electron-transfer reaction between hexacyanoferrate(III) and borohydride
ions at gold nanoparticles in responsive hydrogel-based nanoreactors.5

3.1 Pseudounimolecular Reactions
Bimolecular reactions are typically treated as pseudounimolecular
when one of the reactants is in large excess with respect to the other.5,7,8,25,35 The reasoning behind this assumption is
that, according to the simple Smoluchowski rate, the reactant in larger
concentration would diffuse toward the nanoparticle surface at a much
larger rate than the other reactant. Therefore, when the reactant
in limiting concentration arrives to the catalyst, it will always
find a reactant of the other species to combine with. However, this
is not always true when nanoreactors are considered. In this case,
the diffusion rate, eq 15, depends not only on the bulk reactant concentration but also on
the shell permeability and thus on the molecular interactions of reactants
with the shell. It is thus the combination of both quantities that
determines whether a bimolecular reaction can be treated as pseudounimolecular
or not. If one of the reactants has a much larger diffusion rate than
the other one, e.g. kDB ≫ kDA, the total reaction rate, eq 13, reduces to (see the Supporting Information) 17  which is the well-known
expression of the total reaction rate in unimolecular reactions, ktot1. In this case, the total catalytic time is the sum of the diffusion
time of the slower reactant and the surface reaction time. If both
reactants diffuse from the bulk solution, according to eq 15, this condition is satisfied when . This means that one of the reactants should be
in much higher bulk concentration and/or subjected to a much larger
shell permeability in comparison to the other. In the case where one
of the reactants is created at the nanoparticle surface, we obtain kDB ≫ kDA if the creation
rate of B* is much faster than the rate at which the reactants B*
are transformed into products by reactants A.

In Figure 2 we analyze how large the excess of reactant
B should be for the pseudounimolecular reaction limit to be valid.
This value depends on the relative shell permeability, . For simplicity,
we consider that the surface rate is equal to the diffusion rate of
the reactant in limiting concentration (kR = kDA, diffusion-influenced
reaction). We also consider a typical core–shell nanoreactor
geometry with d ≫ R. When
both reactants have the same permeability (black line), the concentration
of the reactant B should be roughly 10 times larger than that of A
to have a unimolecular reaction. If we then decrease the shell permeability
to the reactant B 10 times, its concentration thus has to become 100
times higher with respect to that of A to keep this limit (moving
from darker to lighter red lines). Figure 2 also shows that the catalytic rate predicted
for a pseudounimolecular reaction for the reactant in limiting concentration
may differ from the fully bimolecular rate by orders of magnitude.
Thus, when one deals with nanoreactors, it is necessary to consider
not only the difference between the bulk reactant concentrations but
also the difference in the shell permeability to the reactants.

Figure 2 Total rate for unimolecular
reactions ktot1 (eq 17) divided by the total reaction rate ktot for bimolecular reactions (eq 13) as a function of the relative reactant
bulk concentration cB0/cA0. The different lines stand for different
relative shell permeabilities to the reactants, . We assume kR = kDA and a typical core–shell
nanoreactor geometry with d ≫ R.

As a consequence, in Figure 3a we study how large the diffusion rate of the reactant
B should be in comparison with that of the reactant A (i.e., how large
the ratio kDB/kDA should
be) in order for the pseudounimolecular reaction limit to be valid.
This critical value depends on the ratio between the surface rate
and the diffusion rate of the slower reactant, kR/kDA. If kR ≈ kDA (diffusion-influenced reaction),
we observe that kDB must be about 1 order of magnitude larger than kDA to simplify the problem
to that of a pseudounimolecular reaction within 2% accuracy. If both
reactants diffuse at the same rate, the total reaction rate estimated
by eq 17 is ∼30%
larger than the real rate.

Figure 3 Total rate
for unimolecular reactions ktot1 (eq 17) divided by the total reaction rate ktot for bimolecular reactions (eq 13) as a function of the reduced
surface rate values kR/kDA. The different lines stand
for different relative reactant diffusion rates kDB/kDA. The reddish lines (a) consider
that the reactant A diffuses at a slower rate than B. The bluish lines
(b) consider the opposite case. The case of equal reactant diffusion
rate is shown by the black lines in (a) and (b).

In the previous discussion we assumed
that A is the limiting reactant and, consequently, we calculated the
catalytic rate for unimolecular reactions given by eq 17 using its diffusion rate. In Figure 3b (the inset) we
show that if the choice of the limiting reactant is wrongly made (i.e.,
B is the limiting reactant), the predicted unimolecular rate can be
more than 1 order of magnitude larger than the real rate. The plateau
reached at larger surface rates coincides with the value of the unimolecular
rate considering B as the limiting reactant. We emphasize here that
in stimuli-responsive nanoreactors the physicochemical properties
of the shell can drastically change around a critical value of the
external stimulus: e.g., from hydrophilic to hydrophobic in PNIPAM-based
nanoreactors at the critical temperature. These changes strongly affect
the permeability and can thus switch the identity of the limiting
reactant from one type to another. Figure 3b thus shows that, when this fact is not
recognized on analyzing experiments, theoretical predictions of the
rates can be off by orders of magnitude. Figure 3a also shows that, if the limiting reactant
is properly identified, we can always treat a bimolecular reaction
as unimolecular if the reaction is diffusion or surface controlled.
This can be also inferred from eq 13. On the one hand, if the diffusion rate of the slowest
reactant is much larger than the surface rate, kDA ≫ kR, the total catalytic rate turns into ktot → kR, which agrees with
the surface-controlled limit for a unimolecular reaction (eq 17). On the other hand,
if we take the limit of very fast surface rate, kR → ∞, we obtain (see Supporting Information) 18  This means
that, if the reaction at the surface of the catalytic nanoparticle
is immediate, then what matters is only the diffusion time of the
slower reactant. Thus, the reaction becomes pseudounimolecular and
diffusion controlled. From a physical point of view, the explanation
is as follows: there are so many “active” reactants
at the nanoparticle surface that one of them will necessarily react
whenever a reactant of the other species arrives.

3.2 Application to Bimolecular Reactions in Responsive Core–Shell
Nanoreactors
Carregal-Romero et al. investigated the bimolecular
electron transfer reaction between hexacyanoferrate(III), Fe(CN)63– (HCF),
and borohydride, BH4–, ions in Au-PNIPAM core–shell nanoreactors.5 In Figure 4a we show the experimentally measured temperature-dependent
catalytic rate for different N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS) cross-linking densities.
We first demonstrate that the bimolecular reaction can be treated
as pseudounimolecular and is diffusion controlled. Then we show how
our theoretical framework can be used to analyze the experimental
data and dissect the permeability into diffusion and partitioning
effects, thereby providing an improved understanding of all underlying
mechanistic effects in this system.

Figure 4 (a) Influence of the temperature on the measured pseudo-first-order
constant in the Au-PNIPAM nanoreactors for different cross-linking
densities: (■) 7% BIS; (●) 10% BIS; (▲) 15% BIS.
Catalytic data are taken from ref (5). (b) Influence of the temperature on the permeability
of the PNIPAM shell to HCF, , estimated using eq 19, for different cross-linking densities:
(□) 7% BIS; (○) 10% BIS; (△) 15% BIS.

As we pointed out before,
it is the combination of bulk reactant concentration and permeability
that determines if a bimolecular reaction can be treated as pseudounimolecular.
The ratio between the bulk borohydride and HCF concentrations is cBH4–0/cHCF0 = 125 (cBH4–0 = 50 mM, cHCF0 = 0.4 mM). Therefore, according to Figure 2, the permeability
ratio should be  for the pseudounimolecular reaction limit to be valid. This is easily
fulfilled, as HCF, in simple terms, is bigger and slower than the
borohydride. Partitioning of HCF has been measured in microgels (with
a lower cross-link density of 5%)43 and
indeed found to be weakly excluded, i.e. clearly , while for the simple and small ion borohydride
excluded volume effects must be expected to be smaller. In addition,
the larger HCF diffuses more slowly than borohydride due to more steric
“obstruction” effects.44 Thus,
HCF to a high certainty has a smaller shell permeability than borohydride,
which means that the reaction can be treated as pseudounimolecular,
with a total rate given by eq 17, HCF being the limiting reactant. In this limit, the relation
between the experimentally observed rate and the calculated total
rate is kobs = ktot(cNR0/cHCF0),25 where cNR0 stands for the nanoreactor concentration.

To discern if the
reaction is diffusion or surface controlled, we estimate the observed
Smoluchowski rate, kDHCF0(cNR0/cHCF0) ≈ 0.3–0.7 s–1 (see the Supporting Information or ref (5) for the input experimental
values). According to Figure 4a, kobs ≈ 0.2 s–1 in the most “open” state of the shell: i.e., being swollen at the
smallest cross-linker density. This means the reaction is diffusion
controlled (consistent with common literature assumptions5,6,45), i.e. kobs = kDHCF(cNR0/cHCF0), with kDHCF, given by eq 15, and the smaller observed rates for larger
cross-linker densities and collapsed states must be ascribed to the
decreasing shell permeability to HCF.

Now, using eq 16, we obtain the shell permeability
to HCF, , as 19  where we have already considered
that the nanoreactor has a core–shell geometry, Rg = R. DHCF0 = kBT/6πη(T)a represents the bulk diffusion coefficient of HCF, with
η(T) being the temperature-dependent viscosity
of water and a ≈ 0.3 nm the HCF size.5 That is, the T dependence of
the bulk diffusion is explicitly considered in our analysis.

We plot the temperature-dependent shell permeability to HCF calculated
using eq 19 for different
cross-linking densities in Figure 4b. We make use of the catalytic data (kobs, shown in Figure 4a) and hydrodynamic radius data (rH ≈ R + d, shown
in Figure S1b in the Supporting Information)
measured by Carregal-Romero et al.5 We
see already that the measured catalytic rate, kobs, does not follow the same trend with the cross-linking
density (Figure 4a)
as the permeability (Figure 4b), because each system was prepared at a different nanoreactor
concentration. The trend is recovered when the observed rate is normalized
by cNR0 (Figure S1a). Figure 4b also shows that the shell
permeability to HCF switches relatively sharply at the polymer volume
transition and is about 1 order of magnitude larger in the swollen
than in the collapsed state of the nanoreactor, which gives rise to
a larger catalytic rate (Figure 4a).

We further find that all the permeability
values are below the HCF reference permeability in bulk solvent, i.e.  (with DHCF0 ≈ 0.9 nm/ns at 298.2 K5), which, according to eq 9, must be assigned to small partitioning and/or slow
diffusion. We examine this in the following in even more detail, while
we solely focus on the swollen part, as only for this case can further
meaningful quantitative assumptions on diffusion be made. In the swollen
state, the mobility decrease can be described by obstruction-hindered
diffusion, e.g., as expressed by 20  ϕ being the PNIPAM volume fraction in the shell. This expression
was developed by Mackie and Meares46 to
explain diffusion due to excluded-volume effects of the polymer, and
it is valid for small-sized solutes in semidilute polymer solutions:44 i.e., it should be applicable to the swollen
state of the hydrogel.

We now separate out the diffusivity from
the permeabilities to extract more quantitative numbers of the partitioning
for further discussion. For the swollen state we assume the diffusivity
is fully provided by eq 20, including its T dependence. For this, we calculate
the PNIPAM volume fraction for different cross-linking densities as 21  where V stands for the whole suspension volume, VP is the volume occupied by the PNIPAM in the shell, mP its mass, ρP0 = 1.1 g/cm347 the mass density of a PNIPAM polymer, and ρP the mean PNIPAM segment density at different cross-linking densities.48 The fact that the normalized permeabilities, , are approximately constant
at low temperatures indicates that the increment of the permeability
with the temperature in the swollen state of the nanoreactor is mostly
due to the diminution of the water viscosity with the temperature.
This is not the case for the 7% BIS case, since a fully swollen nanoreactor
was not achieved under the experimental conditions (see Figure S1b in the Supporting Information).

Using eq 9, we calculate the necessary partitionings to fit the permeabilities
in the swollen nanoreactor state. The results are given in Table 1. Importantly, the
HCF transfer free energies, predicted using eq 8, are all positive and increase with the cross-linking
density. This trend is expected as the excluded volume of the shell
increases with less water content and less free space. Values of the
partitioning are reasonably close to those recently measured for HCF
for cationic hydrogels.43 Hence, our theory
allows a full dissection of experimental rate and permeability effects
into basic underlying mechanisms, such as bulk diffusion, hindered
diffusion in the shell, and thermodynamic partitioning effects based
on physical interactions. Clearly, more work is in order to understand
details of molecular interactions and mobility, in particular in the
collapsed state of the hydrogels.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented the rate theory for surface-catalyzed bimolecular reactions in responsive nanoreactors. Our theory
for nanoreactors is markedly different from the treatment of standard
bimolecular reactions in bulk, since the reactions here only occur
at the surface of the catalyst, coupling the surface reaction rate
with the permeability of the shell, which can be controlled and designed
by material synthesis and stimuli in the environment. Our theory allows
extracting permeabilities from experiments; alternatively, if the
permeabilities are available from reference experiments or modeling,
it can be employed to predict and thus rationally design nanoreactor
kinetics.

We found that the total rate for bimolecular reactions
depends in a nontrivial way on the reactant diffusion and surface
reaction rates. More precisely, the coupling between these time scales
makes it impossible to separate the process into distinct “diffusion
+ reaction” steps, as is the case for standard pseudounimolecular
descriptions previously used to rationalize experiments (interestingly,
breakdown of the standard theory can also be observed in the case
of strong coupling with shell fluctuations49).

In this regard, most of the studies in the literature assume
to be dealing with pseudounimolecular reactions, usually by working
with one of the reactants in large excess. We show that this might
not be enough: tighter conditions strongly dependent on shell permeability
are required, whose breakage can lead to large error in the analysis
of kinetics. This indicates that in nanoreactors one can in principle
switch between pseudounimolecular and bimolecular reactions or change
the identity of the limiting reactant by temperature and other stimuli.
In addition, we also found that, with a proper redefinition of the
diffusion rate, the total catalytic rate assumes the same form regardless
of the origin of the reactants (bulk or nanoparticle surface).

As a practical demonstration, we applied our theory to available
experimental data on the bimolecular electron transfer reaction between
HCF and borohydride ions in Au-PNIPAM core–shell nanoreactors.5 A thorough analysis of the permeability showed
that the rate is governed by a complex interplay between diffusion
and partitioning effects that define the shell permeability to HCF.

We finally note that our theory for bimolecular reactions is strictly
valid for low adsorption of reactants only. Thus, a theory accounting
for diffusion-influenced Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms50 in responsive nanoreactors is still needed.
All of these features will highlight even richer behavior and dynamic
control achievable in responsive nanoreactors.
