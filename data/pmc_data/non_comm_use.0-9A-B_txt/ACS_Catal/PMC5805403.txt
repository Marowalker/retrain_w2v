The
synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical studies of
the dinuclear complex [(MeOH)Fe(Hbbpya)-μ-O-(Hbbpya)Fe(MeOH)](OTf)4 (1) (with Hbbpya = N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyrid-6-yl)amine)
are described. With the help of online electrochemical mass spectrometry,
the complex is demonstrated to be active as a water oxidation catalyst.
Comparing the results obtained for different electrode materials shows
a clear substrate influence of the electrode, as the complex shows
a significantly lower catalytic overpotential on graphitic working
electrodes in comparison to other electrode materials. Cyclic voltammetry
experiments provide evidence that the structure of complex 1 undergoes reversible changes under high-potential conditions, regenerating
the original structure of complex 1 upon returning to
lower potentials. Results from electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
experiments rule out that catalysis proceeds via deposition of catalytically
active material on the electrode surface.

Introduction
With economic growth
and the expansion of modern societies, the
global demand for energy increases steadily every year.1 Currently, this demand is still largely met by
the unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels. As the reserves of
fossil fuels decrease and the effect of CO2 emissions on
the climate becomes more and more apparent, the development of new
technologies for a sustainable energy infrastructure based on the
conversion of solar energy to a chemical fuel has become of critical
importance in the 21st century. Among those new technologies, realizing
the economically viable splitting of water into its elements has emerged
as a key target.2 One of the biggest challenges
in realizing such a process is finding sufficiently efficient and
robust catalysts for the water oxidation reaction that are based on
readily available materials.

Despite considerable advancements
in the field of homogeneous water
oxidation catalysis over the past decade, the best catalysts that
have been developed so far still rely on scarce and expensive materials
such as ruthenium and iridium.3−12 In order for solar fuels to become a competitive alternative to
fossil fuels on a global scale, water oxidation catalysts based on
abundant and affordable first-row transition metals are needed. Among
those metals, iron is one of the prime candidates for the development
of new catalysts due to its high abundance on earth, its rich redox
chemistry, and its prominent role in oxygen binding and oxygen transfer
in many metalloproteins and active sites of enzymes found in nature.13 In recent years, more and more examples of molecular
iron based water oxidation catalysts have been published in the literature.14−28 However, most examples of iron-based catalysts reported so far are
still outperformed by catalysts based on ruthenium and iridium in
terms of turnover numbers,19−28 turnover frequencies,19−28 overpotentials,18−21 and Faradaic efficiencies.19,20 While ruthenium- and
iridium-based systems have been reported to yield TONs in excess of
10000029 and TOFs on the order of 10000
s–1,30 systems based
on first-row transition metals such as iron, cobalt, and manganese
generally exhibit low double-digit turnover numbers and turnover frequencies
on the order of 1 s–1 or lower.9 While for ruthenium-based systems overpotentials below
200 mV31 have been reported, overpotentials
for water oxidation of first-row transition-metal systems—if
reported—generally exceed 500 mV.18−21,32 One notable exception is the pentanuclear iron-based water oxidation
catalyst that was recently reported by Masaoka et al. Although the
catalyst does not work in aqueous solution, a respectable turnover
frequency of 1900 s–1 was found in acetonitrile/water
mixtures.17

The majority of the iron
complexes that have been reported so far
have been studied using sacrificial oxidants such as cerium(IV) ammonium
nitrate (CAN) and periodate. In recent years, however, more and more
evidence has emerged, demonstrating that these oxidants are often
directly involved in the reaction mechanism aside from being simply
innocent outer-sphere one-electron acceptors.33−39 Previously, we investigated iron-based complexes bearing macrocyclic
tetraaza-type ligands for their potential as electrocatalysts for
the water oxidation reaction.18 Using electrochemistry
in general and online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) in
particular, we were able to demonstrate the importance of different
structural motifs for the electronics of the complex and its activity
in catalyzing the water oxidation reaction.

A very important
aspect in homogeneous electrocatalysis which has
so far received only little attention is the influence of the electrode
surface on the reaction mechanisms involving homogeneous electrocatalysts.
If the electron transfer between the catalyst and the electrode proceeds
exclusively via an outer-sphere mechanism, one would expect only a
small influence of the electrode material. However, in the case of
an inner-sphere mechanism involving adsorption of the catalyst on
the electrode surface, a much larger influence of the electrode material
is to be expected.40 Despite the potentially
very important role of the electrode material in electrochemical water
oxidation catalysis, only a few examples of research on this subject
can be found in the literature.41,42

In this report
we introduce the dinuclear oxo-bridged iron complex
[(MeOH)Fe(Hbbpya)-μ-O-(Hbbpya)Fe(MeOH)](OTf)4 (1; Hbbpya = N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyrid-6-yl)amine).
The complex is active as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation, which
is in line with previous reports that have found dinuclear oxygen-bridged
iron complexes to be active water oxidation catalysts.14−16,23,24 However, in the case of complex 1 we show that the
water oxidation activity is strongly dependent on the nature of the
electrode material, resulting in a significantly lower overpotential
on graphitic working electrodes in comparison to other electrode materials.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
Complex 1 was synthesized by combining methanolic solutions of iron(II)
triflate
and Hbbpya under argon (Scheme 1). After the mixture was stirred overnight and the solvent
was subsequently evaporated, a crude red-brownish solid was obtained.
To isolate complex 1, the crude product was recrystallized
in air by vapor diffusion of Et2O into a concentrated methanolic
solution of the crude product, resulting in dark brown crystals of
complex 1. The crystalline material was characterized
by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, and elemental
analysis. An X-ray structure determination unequivocally reveals the
dimeric nature of complex 1 (Figure 1). All relevant bond angles and distances
of the crystal structure of 1 are summarized in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Complex 1
Figure 1 Displacement ellipsoid plot (50% probability level) of complex 1 at 110(2) K. All hydrogen atoms and the four triflate counterions
have been omitted for clarity.

The complex consists of two iron sites bridged by an oxo
ligand.
Each iron site bears an Hbbpya ligand and an axial methanol ligand
following a distorted-octahedral geometry together with the bridging
oxo ligand. The measured bond angles and bond distances are very similar
for both iron sites. All eight Fe–N bond distances fall into
a narrow range of 2.11–2.14 Å. Both N–Fe–N
bond angles of the six-membered chelate rings of 87.0 and 87.1°,
respectively, are close to the ideal 90° of a square-planar structure.
The N–Fe–N angles of the five-membered chelate rings
are more acute at 78.2–78.7°, while the open N–Fe–N
bond angles are much wider at 114.2 and 114.6°. Both internal
Fe–O bond distances between the iron centers and the bridging
oxo ligand of 1.78 Å are shorter than the external Fe–O
bonds distances to the methanol ligands of 2.15 Å. These values
are in good agreement with values previously reported by Thummel et
al. for the iron complexes [(H2O)Fe(ppq)-μ-O-(ppq)FeCl]Cl3 (2; ppq = 2-(pyrid-2′-yl)-8-(1″,10″-phenanthrolin-2″-yl)quinoline)
and [Fe(dpa)Cl2]Cl (3; dpa = N,N-bis(1,10-phenanthrolin-2-yl)-N-isopentylamine) and the values previously reported by Marchetti
et al. for the iron complex [(H2O)Fe(L)-μ-O-(L)Fe(H2O)](ClO4)4 (4; L = 2,2′:6′2″:6″,2‴-quaterpyridine).15,43

While the Fe–O–Fe bond angles in the structures
of
complexes 2 and 4 were measured at 171.3
and 180°, respectively, the Fe–O–Fe bond angle
of 155.78(18)° that was measured for complex 1 deviates
notably from the expected 180°. The atoms of the two Hbbpya ligands
are also not aligned directly on top of each other in the crystal
structure. Instead, each atom of one Hbbpya ligand is offset with
respect to its counterpart in the other Hbbpya ligand by a rotation
around the Fe–Fe axis of about 44° (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, the
two Hbbpya ligands differ in their conformation. While one Hbbpya
ligand is fairly planar with an internal torsion angle of only 3.0°
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information),
one of the two bipyridine moieties of the other Hbbpya ligand is twisted
out of plane, resulting in a considerably greater internal torsion
angle of 16.4° (Figure S2). As a result,
the distances between the two Hbbpya ligands vary from a relatively
narrow range of 3.37–3.55 Å for the two bipyridine moieties
in face parallel alignment to a much wider spread of 3.52–4.40
Å for the other two bipyridine moieties (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). These features suggest
that the distortions in the structure are compensated for by favorable
π–π interactions between the aromatic systems of
the two Hbbpya ligands. The observed distances of 3.37–3.55
Å fall well within the range commonly found for such interactions.44

Next to the structural data for the crystalline
material, mass
spectrometry data confirm that the complex exists exclusively as a
dimeric species in aqueous solution (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). UV–vis measurements of the
aqueous solution show no change in the absorption spectrum for at
least 10 h, confirming that the dimeric species is stable over time
(Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

Electrochemical Experiments
Although complex 1 dissolves in water, it hardly dissolves in solutions containing
perchlorate anions. As a consequence, sodium sulfate was chosen as
the most appropriate electrolyte, even though the sulfate ion has
been shown to inhibit water oxidation activity slightly in comparison
to perchlorate in some cases.10 In 0.1
M Na2SO4 complex 1 does dissolve
up to concentrations of 0.5 mM.

Electrochemistry on Gold
Using a
gold working electrode,
the redox behavior of complex 1 was investigated by performing
cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments across different scan ranges. Figure 2a,b shows the respective
first and second scans of a CV experiment between 0.0 and 1.2 V vs
a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), with each scan started at 0.7
V vs RHE. In the second scan (Figure 2b), four distinct redox events can be observed, indicated
as I–IV in the figure. I and IV are tentatively assigned to
the [FeIIFeII]/[FeIIFeIII] transition and II and III to the [FeIIFeIII]/[FeIIIFeIII] transition. This assignment
is supported by the fact that the oxidation event II at 0.9 V is largely
absent in the first forward scan (Figure 2a) as long as a starting potential above
both reduction events III and IV is chosen. Since the complex is introduced
in the [FeIIIFeIII] state and the selected resting
potential of 0.7 V lies above both reduction events, hardly any [FeIIFeIII] is present to be oxidized in the first
scan. Further evidence for this assignment is obtained when the starting
potential is set to 0.2 V and the scan range is selected to stay below
the onset of second oxidation event between 0.8 and 1.0 V. The corresponding
voltammogram between 0.2 and 0.8 V (Figure 2c) only shows transitions I and IV, showing
that reduction wave IV is connected to oxidation wave I and that reduction
wave III is connected to oxidation wave II.

Figure 2 Results of CV experiments
of 0.5 mM complex 1 in a
0.1 M Na2SO4 solution using a gold working electrode
at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Arrows indicate the direction of each
cycle. (a) First scan between 0.0 and 1.2 V vs RHE, starting at 0.7
V vs RHE. (b) Second scan between 0.0 and 1.2 V vs RHE, starting at
0.7 V vs RHE. (c) Second scan between 0.2 and 0.8 V vs RHE, starting
at 0.2 V vs RHE. (d) First and second scans between 0.0 and 2.0 V
vs RHE, starting at 0.7 V vs RHE.

When the scan range is set to 0.0–2.0 V, a shift in
the
redox behavior is observed. Starting again at 0.7 V, the first forward
scan does not show any new oxidation events below 1.5 V (Figure 2d). Above 1.5 V three
oxidation events are observed, labeled V–VII, which can be
attributed to gold oxide formation (V and VI) and water oxidation
(VII), respectively (vide infra).

In the backward scan, two
reduction events can be seen, one at
1.2 V (VIII; gold oxide reduction) and one at 0.6 V (IX). In the second
forward scan, one additional oxidation event (X) appears at 1.0 V.
Instead of the four transitions I–IV that were initially observed
for the FeII/FeIII transitions on scanning between
0.0 and 1.2 V, only the two new and broad redox events IX and X can
be observed below 1.2 V in subsequent cycles after reaching 2.0 V.
This difference indicates that complex 1 undergoes structural
changes at high potentials. Scanning from 0.0 to 2.0 V and recording
50 scans between 0.0 and 1.2 V at 100 mV/s immediately afterward show
that this change in redox behavior reverts over time; waves IX and
X disappear while waves I–IV reappear during prolonged scanning,
showing that the change to the structure of complex 1 is reversible (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Demonstration of the evolution over time of the redox events observed
after initially scanning to 2.0 V vs RHE with a gold working electrode
in the presence of 0.5 mM complex 1. The change in time
is visualized with CV experiments between 0.0 and 1.3 V vs RHE at
a scan rate of 100 mV/s. All experiments were performed in a 0.1 M
Na2SO4 solution. (a) 50 cycles between 0.0 and
1.3 V vs RHE, starting at 0.7 V vs RHE, recorded immediately after
scanning to 2.0 V vs RHE. The first and last scans are displayed in
black, while the intermediate scans are displayed in gray. Arrows
indicate the change in the current profile over time. (b) Comparison
between the redox events before scanning to 2.0 V vs RHE (solid line)
and scan number 50 after scanning to 2.0 V vs RHE (dashed line).

Evidence that the irreversible
oxidation wave VII belongs to the
oxygen evolution reaction was obtained via OLEMS experiments. In OLEMS
experiments the m/z traces of selected
gaseous species sampled in solution in close proximity to the surface
of the working electrode are recorded during electrochemical experiments.45Figure 4 shows the second forward scan of an OLEMS experiment, recorded
while the potential was cycled between 1.3 and 2.0 V at 1 mV/s, with
a starting potential of 1.3 V. The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the corresponding current
trace. Since the gold electrode was already oxidized during the first
scan of the OLEMS experiment, the gold oxidation waves V and VI are
absent in the second scan, leaving only the oxidation wave VII. The
top panel of Figure 4 shows the mass trace for O2 recorded during the experiment,
which shows a clear onset of oxygen evolution at about 1.9 V that
correlates well with the oxidative current shown in the bottom panel
of Figure 4. Since
previous reports46−49 have shown that electrocatalytic water oxidation by metal complexes
is often preceded or accompanied by oxidative degradation of ligands,
which can result in the formation of CO2, we also recorded
the mass trace of CO2 via OLEMS (Figure 4, middle). The result shows that, in comparison
to oxygen, no significant amounts of CO2 are being formed
during the experiment.

Figure 4 Results of an OLEMS measurement of 0.5 mM complex 1 with a gold working electrode in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (scan range 1.3–2.0 V vs RHE, scan rate 1
mV/s,
starting at 1.3 V vs RHE). Shown is the forward scan of a CV experiment
with the m/z trace for O2 (top), the m/z trace for CO2 (middle), and the corresponding current (bottom).

The gold electrode in itself is in principle capable
of oxidizing
water at high potentials; however, in previous work no detectable
amounts of oxygen were found below 2.0 V for a gold working electrode
in the absence of any additional catalyst.50 While there is still some oxidative current beyond gold oxidation
that is visible in blank measurements, OLEMS measurements with a gold
working electrode in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte
solution in the absence of complex 1 confirm that there
is no detectable amount of oxygen being formed below 2.0 V under those
conditions (Figure S6 in the Supporting
Information).

Electrochemistry on Carbon
The electrochemistry
that
is observed for complex 1 on a pyrolytic graphite (PG)
electrode shows a significant difference from the results obtained
for a gold working electrode. For both electrodes, complex 1 initially shows redox waves I–IV (Figure 5a), which disappear when the potential is
increased to 2.0 V, resulting in the formation of a new species, giving
rise to redox waves IX and X (Figure 5b). Likewise, for both electrode materials the disappearance
of waves IX and X accompanied by the reappearance of waves I–IV
can be seen over time when the potential is kept below 1.2 V after
initially scanning to 2.0 V (Figure 5c,d). However, in contrast to the electrochemistry
on gold, an additional and persistent irreversible oxidation wave
can be observed on PG with an onset potential of about 1.6 V (Figure 6, bottom). While
the separation between the two waves above 1.6 V is not very well
resolved at higher scan rates (100 mV/s, Figure 5b), it becomes much more pronounced at lower
scan rates (10 mV/s and slower, Figure 6, bottom, and Figure 7b).

with the m/z trace for O2 (top), the m/z trace for CO2 (middle), and the corresponding current (bottom).

M Na2SO4 solution recorded on different working
electrodes.
(a) Comparison of the results using PG and GC working electrodes.
Shown is the respective second scan of each experiment, recorded between
0.0 and 1.2 V vs RHE at 100 mV/s with a starting potential of 0.7
V vs RHE. The current recorded on GC was normalized by a factor of
4.5 for the sake of comparison. (b) Comparison of the results using
PG and GC working electrodes. Shown is the respective second scan
of each experiment, recorded between 0.0 and 2.0 V vs RHE at 10 mV/s
with a starting potential of 0.7 V vs RHE. The current recorded on
GC was normalized by a factor of 4.5 for the sake of comparison.

OLEMS measurements for complex 1 with PG were performed
under the same conditions as for the respective experiments with gold,
recording the mass traces for O2 and CO2 while
cycling the potential between 1.3 and 2.0 V at 1 mV/s with a starting
potential of 1.3 V. The recorded current (Figure 6, bottom) shows two oxidation events in the
forward scan from around 1.6 V onward. The corresponding O2 trace (Figure 6,
top) shows that oxygen evolution follows the recorded current profile,
which suggests that both oxidation waves correspond to an oxygen evolution
reaction. It appears that the formation of dioxygen is feasible for
complex 1 in combination with a PG working electrode
starting around 1.6 V, whereas with a gold working electrode this
is not the case until about 1.9 V. (compare Figure 6, top and bottom, with Figure 4, top and bottom).

Aside from oxygen
evolution, significant amounts of CO2 are produced simultaneously
at oxidative potentials when a PG working
electrode is used (Figure 6, middle). While it is difficult to unambiguously assign either
the complex or the electrode material as the source of the CO2, the results obtained when a gold working electrode is used
suggest that most of the CO2 does indeed originate from
the oxidation of pyrolytic graphite. This hypothesis is supported
by the observation that, for a solution containing Fe(OTf)2 instead of complex 1, CO2 formation of the
same order of magnitude with roughly the same onset potential is observed
(vide infra).

In contrast to gold, a PG working electrode does
not produce any
detectable amounts of oxygen in the absence of an additional catalyst
even at potentials significantly greater than 2.0 V (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). This shows clearly
that the presence of complex 1 is crucial for the formation
of dioxygen observed during the experiment.

The apparent difference
in reactivity of complex 1 between experiments with a
gold working electrode and a PG working
electrode prompted us to look further into the correlation between
the properties of the electrode surface and the resulting electrochemistry.
Using a glassy-carbon (GC) working electrode in combination with complex 1 yields results that are qualitatively identical with those
obtained on PG, with respect to both the redox behavior (Figure 7a,b) and the two
oxidation waves above 1.6 V (Figure 7b). Voltammograms recorded with a boron-doped-diamond
(BDD) working electrode instead only show a single oxidation event
above 1.6 V (Figure S8 in the Supporting
Information), similar to the results for a gold working electrode,
instead of the two distinct waves observed for graphitic electrode
materials. A comparison among the results obtained for the four different
electrode materials points to different modes of activity for complex 1 on graphitic working electrodes in comparison to nongraphitic
working electrodes.

Homogeneous Catalyst vs Heterogeneous Surface
Deposit
Since Fe2O3 is known to be
a catalyst for water
oxidation,51−54 it is important to establish that no such deposits are being formed
on the working electrode, which then may be responsible for (part
of) the observed reactivity. To rule out the formation of catalytically
active surface deposits, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
(EQCM) experiments were carried out with a gold working electrode.55,56 The results show no significant change in the mass of the electrode
for the potential window between 1.3 and 2.0 V at 1 mV/s in the presence
of complex 1 (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 (a) Results of an EQCM experiment of 0.5 mM complex 1 in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution, recorded
between
1.3 and 2.0 V vs RHE with a gold working electrode at 1 mV/s, starting
at 1.5 V vs RHE. (b) Voltammograms of a freshly polished PG working
electrode in a blank solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and the same PG working electrode in a blank 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution after cycling three times between 1.3 and
2.0 V vs RHE at 1 mV/s in the presence of 0.5 mM complex 1 in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and subsequent
rinsing in the electrode. Both voltammograms were recorded between
0.0 and 2.0 V vs RHE at 10 mV/s, starting at 0.7 V vs RHE. (c) Result
of an EQCM experiment of 1 mM Fe(OTf)2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4, recorded between 1.3 and 2.0 V vs RHE with
a gold working electrode at 1 mV/s, starting at 1.5 V vs RHE. (d)
Voltammograms of a freshly polished PG working electrode in a blank
solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and the same PG working
electrode in a blank 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution after
cycling three times between 1.3 and 2.0 V vs RHE at 1 mV/s in the
presence of 1 mM Fe(OTf)2 in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and subsequent rinsing in the electrode. Both voltammograms
were recorded between 0.0 and 2.0 V vs RHE at 10 mV/s, starting at
0.7 V vs RHE.

The long-term stability
of complex 1 was evaluated
by means of EQCM in combination with chronoamperometry. At 1.9 V vs
RHE no significant change in the mass of the electrode was observed
over the course of 8 h (Figure S9 in the
Supporting Information).

Since no graphitic EQCM electrodes
were available, a PG working
electrode was instead cycled three times between 1.3 and 2.0 V at
a scan rate of 1 mV/s in the presence of complex 1, taken
out of the electrolyte solution, and rinsed. A subsequently recorded
voltammogram measured in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte
solution in the absence of complex 1 showed no additional
current above the background of a blank measurement (Figure 8b). These results show that,
if any electrode deposition does occur during catalytic water oxidation
mediated by complex 1, it must be a highly reversible
process.

In contrast to the results obtained for complex 1,
EQCM experiments in the presence of 1 mM Fe(OTf)2 show
a clear change in the mass of the gold electrode under identical conditions,
indicating the formation of a deposit on the electrode surface (Figure 8c). Similarly, cycling
a PG working electrode three times between 1.3 and 2.0 V at 1 mV/s
in the presence of Fe(OTf)2 with subsequent rinsing of
the electrode and recording a CV measurement between 0.0 and 2.0 V
in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution without
Fe(OTf)2 present yield a voltammogram which is different
from that of a blank measurement (Figure 8d). OLEMS measurements of Fe(OTf)2 on a PG working electrode reveal water oxidation activity, albeit
with a different current profile and higher onset potential for the
oxygen evolution reaction in comparison to complex 1 (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information).

The ion current for CO2 measured with a PG working electrode
in the presence of complex 1 and Fe(OTf)2,
respectively, is of the same order of magnitude (compare Figure 6, middle, with Figure S10 in the Supporting Information, middle),
despite Fe(OTf)2 lacking any ligand that could conceivably
be oxidized to CO2 under these conditions, providing further
evidence for the assumption that the CO2 formation observed
in OLEMS experiments with complex 1 on a PG working electrode
originates predominantly from the oxidation of the electrode material
rather than oxidation of the ligand.

Mechanistic Considerations
For PG, GC, and Au working
electrodes, we found that the redox behavior of complex 1 in solution changes upon exposure to high potentials. When the complex
is kept at lower potentials afterward, it slowly reverts to the original
behavior (Figures 3 and 5c,d). Since mass spectrometry and UV–vis
spectroscopy show that complex 1 exists exclusively as
a dimer at the start of the experiment, this reversibility means that
the dimeric structure is regenerated at lower potentials. A possible
explanation could be that the complex falls apart into two Fe(Hbbpya)
monomers upon oxidation to the FeIV or FeV state
which reassociate to form complex 1 in the FeIII state.

Evidence for the molecular nature of the catalytically
active species was obtained from EQCM experiments on gold, in which
no mass changes of the electrode were observed in the presence of
complex 1 under catalytic conditions. From control experiments
with Fe(OTf)2 instead of complex 1 we can
rule out any potential pathways involving decoordination of the Hbbpya
ligand leading to the subsequent formation of the active catalyst
in the form of solid deposits on the electrode surface.

For
the combination of complex 1 with graphitic working
electrodes, oxygen evolution was observed already at significantly
lower potentials in comparison to complex 1 in combination
with other electrode materials. This suggests that the first oxidation
wave above 1.6 V seen on both PG and GC (Figure 7b) might be related to specific interactions
between the catalyst and a graphitic electrode surface. The difference
in oxygen evolution activity of complex 1 on a graphitic
working electrode in comparison to a gold working electrode strongly
suggests a mechanism other than the involvement of surface oxides
which has previously been suggested for a flavin-based water oxidation
catalyst.41 Instead, hydrophobic interactions,
for example, in the form of π–π stacking between
the aromatic Hbbpya ligand and an sp2 carbon surface might
take place.57−62 The substrate influence of graphitic electrodes has an apparent
beneficial influence on the water oxidation capabilities of complex 1, leading to a significantly earlier onset of oxygen evolution
on PG and GC working electrodes in comparison to BDD and gold working
electrodes.

When comparing the voltammograms recorded for a
PG working electrode
in a blank 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution before and
after being cycled three times between 1.3 and 2.0 V at 1 mV/s in
the presence of complex 1, we found no difference in
the recorded current. This means that the interaction between complex 1 and the surface of a graphitic electrode must be highly
reversible in nature and does not lead to the formation of a lasting
adsorbed state.

Kinetic Considerations
At the relatively
low currents
that we record, the most reliable technique to determine the Faradaic
efficiency is the use of a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup.
Due to rotation of the electrode, the electrolyte flows from the disk,
where water oxidation occurs, to the ring, where dioxygen is reduced
and can be quantified. This experiment is not straightforward in the
case of a homogeneous catalyst, since both the catalyst and dioxygen
are diffusive species. This means that partially oxidized catalytic
species and dioxygen can both be reduced on the ring. As a result,
the current at the disk electrode is made up of three parts: current
caused by catalytic water oxidation, reversible oxidation of the catalyst,
and losses from irreversible side reactions such as CO2 formation.

The contributions from reversible oxidation of
dissolved complex in solution and formation of dioxygen were disentangled
by two separate RRDE experiments. Using a Pt ring electrode set to
0.5 V vs RHE in combination with a PG disk electrode allows us to
determine the sum of the current caused by oxidation of complex and
dioxygen formation (Figure S13 in the Supporting
Information). The amount of current caused only by reversible oxidation
of the complex was then quantified separately in a second experiment
using a ring electrode made from GC instead of Pt, as the GC ring
electrode does not reduce dioxygen at a potential of 0.5 V vs RHE
(Figure S14 in the Supporting Information).
The maximum overall collection efficiency for the setup was then determined
with K3[Fe(CN)6] using a PG disk electrode and
Pt ring electrode (Figure S15 in the Supporting
Information).

For complex 1 we find the following
contributions
to the current. At 1.75 V 26% of the current is due to dioxygen formation
and 23% is due to reversible losses. The remaining 51% is then attributed
to irreversible losses. At 2.0 V we found 32% of current due to dioxygen
formation, 33% due to reversible losses, and 35% due to irreversible
losses.

The Faradaic efficiencies of dioxygen formation that
we found are
largely underestimated for two reasons. First, due to rotation, the
transient time of catalytic species over the disk is limited and may
be too short to complete a catalytic cycle. This results in a considerable
amount of partially oxidized species that are reduced back at the
ring. At a stationary electrode such species may complete the catalytic
cycle to produce dioxygen. Attempts to further reduce the rotation
speed and thereby increase the transient time of catalytic species
over the disk resulted in a delayed response on the ring and were
abandoned. Second, due to the low solubility of O2 in water,
the collection efficiency of dioxygen on the ring can be significantly
lower than that of other species, such as ferricyanide, which was
used to determine the collection efficiency of the setup. In a separate
RRDE experiment using a Pt disk electrode and a Pt ring electrode,
we found a Faradaic efficiency for oxygen evolution of only 68% at
1.7 V. As a result, the turnover frequencies mentioned below for water
oxidation catalyzed by complex 1 should be considered
as conservative estimates.

We used eq 1 in combination
with the Faradaic efficiency obtained from RRDE experiments to determine
the TOF of complex 1 at different overpotentials. In
this equation, ν is the scan rate of the experiment, ip is the current of oxidation wave X (cf. Figures 2 and 5), and icat is the catalytic current
at the potential for which the TOF is to be determined. Additional
details about the calculations and RRDE experiments are available
in the Supporting Information. 1  

The results show that the
TOF increases as the applied potential
increases. At 1.75 V we found a TOF of 0.12 s–1 for
complex 1, which increases to 1.2 s–1 at 2.0 V. This demonstrates that electron-transfer kinetics remain
rate limiting until at least 2.0 V vs RHE.

A comparison of the
catalytic performance with data from the literature
is complicated by the fact that the majority of kinetic studies have
been carried out in the presence of chemical oxidants rather than
by electrochemical means, which leads to a poorly defined overpotential
for those cases. However, the rates determined for complex 1 with graphitic working electrodes compare favorably to values reported
in the literature, as most iron-based catalysts have been reported
to exhibit TOFs on the order of 0.1 s–1 or lower
in water. Typical examples range from 0.012 s–1 reported
by Akermark et al. to 0.23 s–1 for the Fe(mcp) system
reported by Costas et al.26,27 Some notable exceptions
are the Fe(TAML) system by Collins et al. and the Fe(ppq) system by
Thummel et al., for which initial rates of 1.3 and 2.2 s–1, respectively, were found in the presence of excess CAN.15,22 In addition, it is also important to note that 1 shows
a significantly earlier onset for the OER by approximately 0.2 V in
comparison to a series of Fe(cyclam) complexes that were reported
earlier under identical reaction conditions, also using PG working
electrodes.18

Conclusions
Complex 1 was found to be active as an electrocatalyst
for the water oxidation reaction. Results obtained from EQCM experiments
rule out the possibility of the formation of a solid deposit on the
electrode surface as the true catalytic species, highlighting the
stability of complex 1 under catalytic conditions and
providing evidence for the molecular nature of the catalytically active
species.

The results of CV experiments show a clear shift in
the observed
FeII/FeIII redox behavior after exposure of
complex 1 to high potentials (2.0 V vs RHE), which suggests
that complex 1 is merely the precatalyst and not the
true active species. However, in a subsequent CV experiment the original
redox behavior of complex 1 was recovered over time,
showing that the change in redox behavior is reversible and that the
dimeric structure of complex 1 is regenerated.

In comparison to other iron-based water oxidation electrocatalysts,
complex 1 exhibits a remarkably low onset potential of
oxygen evolution in combination with a PG working electrode, with
a recorded overpotential on the scale of only 300–400 mV with
respect to the thermodynamic potential of the water oxidation reaction
of 1.23 V. On the basis of a comparison of the catalytic behavior
of complex 1 with working electrodes made up of different
materials, the onset potential of oxygen evolution observed in the
case of graphitic working electrodes is significantly lower in comparison
to experiments with a gold working electrode, demonstrating a strong
substrate influence of the electrode material on the catalytic performance.
This means that for any attempts to benchmark water oxidation catalysts
electrochemically a possible influence of the electrode material must
be considered.

While our results show that using graphitic working
electrodes
in combination with complex 1 has clear advantages over
using gold working electrodes in terms of catalyst performance, CO2 formation from graphite electrodes represents a potential
drawback that one would have to consider for sustainable fuel production
applications. To the best of our knowledge, our findings represent
the first evidence that substrate effects of the electrode material
can lead to a significant reduction of the overpotential of a homogeneous
electrocatalyst for the water oxidation reaction, emphasizing the
importance of the electrode material in electrocatalytic applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instrumentation
tert-Butylamine was purchased from Acros Organics. 2,2′-Bipyridine, mCPBA, 6-bromo-2,2′-bipyridine, (S)-BINAP, iron powder, PhCF3, and KOtBu
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. p-Toluenesulfonic
acid anhydride was purchased from VWR. Pd(dba)2, TFA, and
MTBE were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals were used
as received without further purification. The concentration of mCPBA
was determined via titration with sodium thiosulfate before use. (S)-BINAP, iron powder, PhCF3, and KOtBu were stored under argon.

2,2′-Bipyridine mono-N-oxide, 6-amino-2,2′-bipyridine, and N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyrid-6-yl)amine were synthesized according to
literature procedures.63−65 Solvents were degassed according to standard freeze–pump–thaw
protocols.

UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary
50 Scan spectrophotometer.
Mass spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific MSQ Plus ESI spectrometer.
Elemental analyses were performed by Mikroanalytisches Laboratorium
Kolbe in Germany.

Electrochemical Experiments
All
electrochemical measurements
with the exception of the EQCM and RRDE experiments (details below)
were performed in custom-made single-compartment glass cells, recorded
on Ivium potentiostats, and operated by IviumSoft software, using
a three-electrode setup with the working electrode in hanging meniscus
configuration. The working electrodes used in the experiments were
a pyrolytic graphite (PG) disk, two gold disk electrodes of different
sizes, a glassy-carbon (GC) rod, and a boron-doped-diamond (BDD) disk.
The respective (geometric) surface areas are 0.2 cm2 (PG),
0.13 and 0.5 cm2 (gold), and 0.07 cm2 (GC and
BDD). A large surface area gold plate was used as a counter electrode
in all experiments. The reference electrode was a reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE) made up of a platinum mesh in H2-saturated
electrolyte at the same pH as the electrolyte solution inside the
cell. The cell and the reference electrode were connected via a Luggin
capillary.

The PG electrode was prepared before each experiment
by polishing the electrode surface with sandpaper. The GC electrode
was prepared by polishing the electrode surface with sandpaper first
and subsequently with alumina suspensions (1.0 μm followed by
0.3 μm). For both the PG and the GC electrodes, the polishing
was followed by removal of excess debris by sonicating the electrode
in Milli-Q water for at least 5 min.

The gold electrodes were
prepared before each experiment by oxidizing
the surface at 10 V for 30 s in a 10% H2SO4 solution,
followed by stripping of the gold oxide layer in a 6 M HCl solution
and subsequent electropolishing of the electrode by scanning for 200
cycles between 0.0 and 1.75 V vs RHE at 1000 mV/s in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte solution.

The BDD electrode was prepared
before each experiment by sonication
for 5 min in concentrated HNO3 followed by sonication for
5 min in Milli-Q water.

All glassware used in electrochemical
measurements was routinely
cleaned of any organic contamination by boiling in a 3/1 mixture of
concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid. Prior to each experiment, the
glassware was cleaned by 3-fold rinsing and boiling in Milli-Q water.
All electrolyte solutions were prepared from p.a. grade chemicals
(Merck Suprapur) and Milli-Q water (resistivity >18.2 MΩ).
Prior
to measurements, the electrolyte solution was purged of air by bubbling
with argon (Linde, Ar 6.0) for at least 20 min. During the measurements,
the cell was constantly kept under argon flow to prevent air from
entering.

Due to slow dissolution of complex 1 in
0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution, the complex
was initially
dissolved in a small amount of Milli-Q water (typically 1–2
mL) and subsequently added to the electrochemical cell containing
the electrolyte solution. The concentration of electrolyte in the
cell was adjusted to account for the resulting dilution. All experiments
in this report were performed at a catalyst concentration of 0.5 mM.

For the OLEMS measurements, the gases formed at the working electrode
were collected via a hydrophobic tip (KEL-F with a porous Teflon plug)
in close proximity to the surface of the working electrode and analyzed
in a QMS 200 mass spectrometer. A detailed description of the OLEMS
setup is available elsewhere.45 For the
mass spectrometry data recorded during cyclic voltammetry, background
correction was done by assuming an exponential decay fit (see Figures 4 and 6 and Figures S6 and S10 in the
Supporting Information).

EQCM experiments were performed in
a 3 mL Teflon cell purchased
from Autolab. The top part of the cell was modified to allow for electrochemical
measurements under an inert atmosphere. For further details, see Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. The
EQCM was controlled by an Autolab potentiostat operated by NOVA 2.0
software. Autolab EQCM electrodes with a surface area of 1.5 cm2 consisting of a 200 nm gold layer deposited on a quartz crystal
were used as working electrodes. A custom-made RHE reference electrode
was used which is described elsewhere.46

RRDE experiments were performed in a large single-compartment
glass
cell with a Pine rotator, using Pt and GC ring electrodes and a PG
disk electrode purchased from Pine. All ring and disk electrodes were
polished with alumina suspensions (1.0, 0.3, and 0.05 μm) before
use. The Pt electrodes were subsequently treated with electropolishing
by cycling the potential between −0.5 and 2.0 V vs RHE for
100 cycles at a scan rate of 500 mV/s before the experiment. The maximum
collection efficiency was determined in a separate experiment using
the ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple (0.5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution).
The RRDE was controlled by an Autolab potentiostat operated by NOVA
2.0 software.

Synthesis of Fe(OTf)2·5.5H2O
Iron powder (1.44 g, 25.8 mmol) was carefully added
in portions to
4.5 mL of 98% triflic acid (50.0 mmol) in 30 mL of water at room temperature
with stirring. After all gas evolution ceased, the mixture was heated
to 60 °C for 1 h while stirring was maintained. The remaining
solids were removed by filtration, and the water was evaporated under
vacuum, yielding a white powder with a slight blue-green hue which
was dried under vacuum. Yield: 8.6 g (19.0 mmol, 76%). The compound
was stored under argon to prevent subsequent changes in the hydration
state over time. Anal. Calcd for C2F6Fe2O6S2·5.5H2O (453.0 g/mol):
C, 5.30; H, 2.45; N, 0.00. Found: C, 5.28; H ,2.46; N, 0.00.

Synthesis
of [(MeOH)Fe(Hbbpya)-μ-O-(Hbbpya)Fe(MeOH)](OTf)4 (1)
N,N-Bis(2,2′-bipyrid-6-yl)amine
(24 mg, 0.07 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of degassed methanol. Subsequently
Fe(OTf)2·5.5H2O (34 mg, 0.07 mmol) dissolved
in 2 mL of degassed methanol was added, resulting in a deep red solution.
The mixture was stirred overnight under a N2 atmosphere
at room temperature. After removal of the solvent under vacuum, the
obtained crude product was dissolved in a small amount of methanol
(∼1 mL). Complex 1 was obtained as dark brown
crystals through slow vapor diffusion of diethyl ether into a methanolic
solution of the crude product in air. The crystals were collected
by filtration, washed with diethyl ether followed by washing with
a small amount of cold methanol, and subsequently dried in air. Yield:
39 mg (0.03 mmol, 73%). ESI-MS (H2O): found [FeIII(bbpya)-μ-O-(bbpya)FeIII]2+m/z 388.6, calcd m/z 388.1. Anal. Calcd for C46H38F12Fe2N10O15S4·2H2O (1474.0 g/mol): C, 37.46; H, 2.87; N, 9.50. Found: C, 37.61;
H, 2.91; N, 9.63.
