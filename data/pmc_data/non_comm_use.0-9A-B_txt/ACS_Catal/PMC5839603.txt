An organocatalytic
strategy for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted
pyrrolidines with monoactivated azomethine ylides in high enantiomeric
excess and excellent exo/endo selectivity is presented. The key to
success is the intramolecular activation via hydrogen bonding through
an o-hydroxy group, which allows the dipolar cycloaddition
to take place in the presence of azomethine ylides bearing only one
activating group. The intramolecular hydrogen bond in the azomethine
ylide and the intermolecular hydrogen bond with the catalyst have
been demonstrated by DFT calculations and mechanistic proofs to be
crucial for the reaction to proceed.

==== Body
The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reaction of azomethine ylides holds a favored position in the synthetic
chemist’s arsenal to synthesize pyrrolidine derivatives, as
it provides one of the most direct and straightforward approaches.1 In this area, the preferred strategy involves
the use of α-amino ester derivatives such as azomethine ylide
precursors, since most of the pyrrolidine derivatives present in nature
and pharmaceutical products bear a carboxylic acid group at the position
α to the nitrogen atom. In the past few years two main approaches
have been consolidated in the literature regarding dipolar cycloadditions:
metal catalysis2 and organocatalysis.3 The first one commonly describes a Lewis acid
and a weak base combination which promotes the generation of metallo-azomethine
ylides (Scheme 1, top).2 These metal-catalyzed methods have successfully
provided access to a wide range of substituted enantiomerically enriched
pyrrolidines.4−9

Scheme 1 Different Strategies for the 1,3-Dipolar Reaction with Azomethine
Ylides and the Present Work
In the past few years, organocatalysis has appeared as
a metal-free
alternative for the asymmetric synthesis of pyrrolidines via 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition. However, the substitution pattern of the final pyrrolidines
that can be prepared is quite restricted. In general terms, this approach
needs two activating groups (two EWGs or one EWG and one aryl group)
at the dipole10−14 to increase the acidity of protons in the α-position, to overcome
the weak activation of the imine or dipolarophile performed by the
organocatalyst (Scheme 1, middle).3 Only in a few specific cases,
wherein both the imine (p-NO2C6H4) and the olefin partner (alkyl maleates) are highly
activated, the reaction proceeds with a dipole bearing an alkyl and
an electron-withdrawing group under 20 mol % of phosphoric acid catalysis
at 70 °C.10j However, to prepare proline
scaffolds, which are prevalent in the core structures of efficient
catalysts15 and biologically important
compounds,16 would require the cleavage
of one of the electron-withdrawing groups (Scheme 1, middle). Moreover, this approach has some
additional limitations (Scheme 1, middle-right): (i) there is low reactivity and enantioselectivity
with ketimine-dipole derivatives,12 (ii)
it is unreactive with β,β-disubstituted double bonds,
and (iii) no α-alkyl substitution is allowed at the dipole.
Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop an organocatalytic
method with monoactivated azomethine ylide glycine ester derivatives
that would be able to overcome the low reactivity and to solve all
the aforementioned limitations described in the literature. In order
to reach this objective, we envisioned that an additional activation
of the imine, as observed for metal-catalyzed reactions (Lewis base
and acid interaction, Scheme 1, top), would be necessary to increase the acidity of the
monoactivated azomethine ylides and make it reactive enough in absence
of a second activating group. A hydroxy group in the ortho position
would be in place to activate the nitrogen of the imine via an intramolecular
hydrogen bond (Scheme 1, bottom). This would enhance the acidity of the monoactivated methylene
and allow activation by the organocatalyst, which up until now has
never been possible. Nitroalkenes were chosen as suitable coupling
partners, as they have proved to be activated by bifunctional organocatalysts.
Interestingly, the organocatalytic reaction with nitroalkenes as the
dipolarophile has scarcely been explored, and only moderate results
have been reported.12,14

In this work, we describe
an organocatalytic method for the synthesis
of tetrasubstituted pyrrolidines in high enantiomeric excess and excellent
endo selectivity. This strategy employs monoactivated azomethine ylides.
A hydrogen bond interaction between the o-hydroxy
group and the nitrogen of the imine, both present in the dipole, allows
the reaction to proceed in the presence of only one activating group
(EWG).

Our study started by investigating the dipolar cycloaddition
reaction
of the azomethine ylides (1a,b) and nitroalkene 2A as model substrates in the presence of a variety of thiourea-
and squaramide-based bifunctional catalysts (4) at room
temperature (Table 1). As expected, the reaction of azomethine ylide 1a did
not proceed (R = H, entry 1), and we only recovered the unaltered
starting materials. To our delight, we found that the presence of
an o-hydroxy group (1b, R = OH) provoked
a dramatic change in the reactivity with good conversions and excellent
enantioselectivies, and different thiourea-based catalysts (entries
2–4) could be used. The use of squaramide-based catalysts resulted
in lower enantioselectivies and conversions (4d,e) (entries 5 and 6). Takemoto’s catalyst 4a (entry 2) was found to be the optimal bifunctional organocatalyst.
We then studied the role of the solvent (entries 7–12). The
chlorinated (entries 7–9) as well as the oxygenated solvents
(THF and Et2O), led to the formation of pyrrolidine 3Ab with lower ee values. When another apolar solvent such
as p-xylene was used, an excellent conversion and
complete endo selectivity (only the endo adduct was observed in all
cases) and stereocontrol were observed (entry 12). We tried to decrease
the amount of the catalyst loading to 2.5 mol %. However, low conversions
were found under these reaction conditions (entries 13 and 14).

Once the optimal
reaction conditions had been determined (entry
12, Table 1), we studied
the scope of the dipolar cycloaddition reaction with regard to the
nitroalkene (Table 2). The reaction was scaled up to 2.0 mmol, with no detrimental effect
on the enantioselectivity (entry 2). Electron-donating groups (3B,C, entries 3 and 4), halogens (3D, entry 5), ortho substituents (3E, entry 6), more sterically
hindered aromatic groups (naphthyl group, entry 7), and heterocycles
(entry 8) were well tolerated, leading to the desired pyrrolidines
with excellent yields and from moderate to excellent enantioselectivities
(up to >99%). It is important to note that to date only moderate
and
low enantioselectivities have been described regarding dipolar cycloadditions
of azomethine ylides bearing EWGs with nitroalkenes as coupling partners.12,14 The reaction also proceeded with excellent ee values in the presence
of a conjugated double bond (3H, entry 9) as well as
primary (3I), secondary (3J), and tertiary
alkyl residues (3K) (entries 10–12). However,
longer reaction times were required. The more challenging β,β-disubstituted
nitroalkene9 reacted efficiently with 1b and led to the pyrrolidine 3Lb with a good
yield and enantioselectivity (entry 13). The absolute configuration
of the asymmetric centers of 3Db was unequivocally assigned
as 2R, 3S, 4R ,and
5S (Table 2, top right) by X-ray crystallographic analysis.17

e This
reaction was carried out on
a 2.0 mmol scale using 20 mol % of catalyst 4a.

A variety of different dipoles 1c–i were also studied (Scheme 2). An EWG or EDG at the aryl
group of the dipole was tolerated
and led to pyrrolidines 3Ac–Ae with
excellent enantioselectivities (Scheme 2a). The reaction also worked with 1- and 2-naphthyl
derivatives (see Scheme 2b,c). Therefore, when the cycloaddition was carried out with the
2-naphthylimine 1f, the corresponding adduct 3Af was obtained in good yield and high enantioselective excess (Scheme 2b). However, the
use of the 1-naphthyl derivative 1g afforded the pyrrolidine 3Ag in moderate yield and moderate enantioselectivity (Scheme 2c). The reaction
also worked at the tertiary center of the dipole (1h),
leading to the synthesis of the pyrrolidine 3Ah with
a quaternary center with 79% yield and excellent ee (96% ee; Scheme 2d). Interestingly,
the reaction proceeded with the bulkier and enolizable ketimine ylide 1i to give pyrrolidines 3Bi and 3Ki, bearing a quaternary benzylic center, with excellent enantioselectivities
(Scheme 2e). The activation
of the aza-methylene ylide by other groups, instead of the hydroxyl
group (NH2), was also studied with unexpected results.18

Scheme 2 Use of Different Dipoles 1c–i under
Hydrogen Bond Catalysis
The o-hydroxy group has been demonstrated
to be
the key to the success of the dipolar cycloaddition. Moreover, we
wanted to take advantage of its presence and form valuable building
blocks for organic synthesis. We envisioned the formation of the 3,4-dihydrocoumarin
scaffold fused to the pyrrolidine ring via a double annulative process,
displacing the phosphonate group intramolecularly.19 We were delighted to find that ketimines 1i,j, in the presence of β,γ-unsaturated α-ketophosphonates 5, led to the formation of dihydrocoumarins 6 with good yields and from moderate to excellent enantioselectivities,
in the presence of only one activating group (Scheme 3). The absolute configuration was determined
by X-ray analysis of a crystal from 6Bj·HCl obtained
from protonation of 6Bj with HCl (see the Supporting Information for details).20

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Dihydrocoumarins 6
In order to gain further insight
into the reaction mechanism, additional
experiments and DFT calculations were carried out. In our initial
hypothesis, the intramolecular hydrogen bond is the key factor in
increasing the acidity of the methylene at the imine. The reaction
was carried out with the imine 1a (R = H) without any
reactivity (entry 1, Table 1). In order to discard any activity as a hydrogen bond acceptor
(a Lewis acid), we carried out the reaction with the o-methoxy imine 1 (see Scheme 4a). However, no reactivity was observed after
2 days, due to the absence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond.

Scheme 4 (a) Reaction of Imine 1k with 2A in the
Presence of 4a, (b) Gibbs Free Energy for the Proton
Transfer Reaction between Takemoto’s Catalyst 4a and Imines 1a,b, and (c) Most Stable Conformations
of Imine 1b′
Taking into account that the intramolecular hydrogen bond
of the
hydroxyl group with the imine is necessary to increase the reactivity
of the azomethine ylides 1b–i, we
first carried out a conformational study of 1b′ by DFT calculations21a (see Scheme 4, bottom). The NBO
analysis of 1b′-I shows that the charge associated
with the C atom is −0.311 and that with the O atom is −0.725.
Isomers 1b′-I and 1b′-II were
the most stable, whereas the suppression of the intramolecular hydrogen
bond in conformers 1b′-III and 1b′-IV provoked an increase in the relative energy of nearly 13 kcal/mol.
Moreover, the conformation 1b′-I possesses the
most appropriate orientation for hydrogen bond coordination with the
Takemoto’s catalyst. The presence of the OH in imine 1b induces a lower deprotonation energy in comparison with 1a (see Scheme 4b), which could be responsible for the higher reactivity of imine 1b. Precisely, the activation of the azomethine ylide via
deprotonation plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism (see
below).

We also considered the reaction with the naphthalene-imine 1g (see Scheme 2c). This reaction took place after 2 days in 42% yield with 78% ee.
In this case, a Bader-QTAIM21b,21c analysis indicates
the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond (see the Supporting Information). Other reasons could
be responsible for the lower reactivity at room temperature such as
kinetic control, steric effects, and/or intermolecular interactions
between catalysts and imine. Therefore, further exploration of the
mechanism is needed to understand the role of the intramolecular hydrogen
bond of 1b when it interacts with the catalyst 4a (see below).

We then studied the reaction mechanism
of the dipolarophile (nitroalkene)
with the azomethine imine 1b′-I in the presence
of catalyst 4a (Figure 1)21 by DFT calculations.
We considered three different coordination points of the reactants
with the catalyst with both endo and exo approaches, considering Takemoto’s,22 Pápai’s,23 and Zhong’s24 models. In each
case, the preassociation complex (PAC),25 intermediates, and products (still connected to the catalyst) were
computed together with the transition states connecting them. While
in Takemoto’s model the nitroalkene is directly coordinated
to the thiourea moiety, in Pápai’s model the thiourea
interacts with the azomethine ylide. The third model considered (Zhong),
similar to Pápai’s model, shows an additional hydrogen
bond interaction of the aryl group of the catalyst 4a with the azomethine ylide. First, the geometry and relative energy
of the preassociation complex (PAC)25 was
obtained for the six different approaches. In the case of the exo
approaches, low energetic barriers for the first C–C bond formation
were found (1.34–2.82 kcal/mol). However, for the second barrier,
the intermediates generated for the three different models did not
show the proper conformation necessary to form the second C–C
bond (attack on the C=N bond) because the nitronate intermediate
was too far away and was not properly oriented (see the Supporting Information for more details). In
the case of the endo approaches, the energy for the first barrier
(TS1, first C–C bond) from the preassociation complex
was also very low once the two reactants (azomethine ylide and nitroalkene)
were attached to the catalyst (see Figure 1). Once the first C–C bond is formed,
the attack on the imine (TS2) can take place in the endo
approaches, and different energetic barriers were found. Interestingly,
Takemoto’s model gave the highest energetic barrier (TS2 = 24.68 kcal/mol) and led to the opposite enantiomer in comparison
with that obtained experimentally, which is a nonplausible mechanism.
In the case of Zhong’s model while the first barrier (TS1 = 3.35 kcal/mol) was found to be higher than in the case
of Pápai’s model (TS1 = 1.84 kcal/mol), the
second barrier was found to be lower (TS2 = 14.48 and 16.47
kcal/mol, respectively). In addition, both the intermediate and the
product (still attached to the catalyst) found in Zhong’s model
were thermodynamically more stable. Although both models are possible,
the lower kinetic barrier found in Zhong’s mechanism makes
it the more favorable pathway. Furthermore, the simulations also show
that the pathway followed in Zhong’s model is the only one
whose intermediate lies below the energy of the separate reactants
(4a + 1b + 2A), thus confirming
the proposed mechanism and assuming this approach.

Figure 1 Energetic profile of
the endo approaches for the three different
models studied (values are in kcal/mol). Relative Gibbs free energies
are referenced to the separated reactants (4a + 1b + 2A). For exo approaches see the Supporting Information.

Bonding Bader analysis in the three PACs shows that an intermolecular
hydrogen bond between the thiourea 4a and the OH group
of ylide 1b′ is observed only in Zhong’s
model (see the Supporting Information for
further details). For clarity, only the imine part for the three models
has been represented in Figure 2 (in Zhong’s model the additional hydrogen bond with
the catalyst is shown as 4a-NH). This additional hydrogen
bond provides additional stabilization of the PAC, and it further
increases the reactivity of the azomethine ylide (see the Supporting Information). Confirmation of this
assumption has been done by a Bader analysis21b,21c on the free imine 1b′ and the preassociation
complex (PAC) on the three models. Figure 2 presents the electron density in the bond
critical point corresponding to the intramolecular H bond (ρNH), together with the N–H and O–H distances.
In the cases of Pápai’s and Takemoto’s models,
ρNH slightly increases from 0.058 to 0.066 and 0.069,
respectively, with respect to the free imine anion 1b′, and the N–H bond was shortened by 0.07 Å. Interestingly,
in the case of Zhong’s model, the presence of the additional
intermolecular H bond between the imine and the catalyst 4a (see the Supporting Information for the
complete Bader analysis) provokes a substantial increase of the strength
of the intramolecular NH bond (ρNH = 0.082) and a
shorter N–H distance (from 1.67 Å in 1b′ to 1.53 Å in Zhong’s model). These consecutive inter-
and intramolecular H bonds are able to stabilize the negative charge
α to the carbonyl group and can be considered as one of the
main factors favoring Zhong’s approach with respect to those
of Takemoto and Pápai.

and N–H and
O–H distances.

Figure 3 shows
the
two transition states (TS1 and TS2) of Zhong’s
model. Once the first C–C bond (blue line, 3.36 Å) is
formed (top), the nitronate intermediate generated is properly oriented:
hydrogen bonds (1.81 Å) between the thiourea moiety and the ammonium,
as well as with the hydroxy group, favor the cyclization to form the
second C–C bond (blue line, 2.13 Å) to give the final
pyrrolidine core.

and selected distances for Zhong’s model.

In summary, an organocatalytic system for the dipolar cycloaddition
of monoactivated azomethine ylides using a bifunctional catalyst is
presented. The imine-dipole bears an o-hydroxy group,
which increases the acidity of the methylenic protons and enhances
the reactivity, allowing the synthesis of a large variety of pyrrolidines
with four contiguous stereocenters with excellent stereocontrol. Therefore,
the reaction can be achieved with di- and trisubstituted nitroalkenes,
α-methyl α-amino ester derivatives, and ketimine derivatives
as dipolarophiles. This dramatic and crucial increase in the reactivity
can be explained by the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl
group and the imine at the dipole and the intermolecular hydrogen
bond with the catalyst 4a which have been experimentally
and computationally supported.

When we performed the reaction with the nitrogen
dipole 1l in the presence of nitroalkene 2A, we obtained the aza-chromene 7 (see the Supporting Information). This behavior could
be justified by the higher nucleophilicity of the nitrogen (1l) in comparison to the oxygen (1b).

a Geometry optimization
was carried out with the M06-2X functional in combination with the
6-31g(d,p) basis set and including the empirical dispersion correction
D3 to include van der Waals forces. Harmonic frequencies and thermodynamic
corrections were computed at the same level. More accurate values
of the final energy were computed over the geometries previously obtained
with the same functional and with the larger basis set 6-31++G(d,p),
including solvent effects (p-xylene) with the SMD
solvation model. All simulations were carried out with the Gaussian09
program. See the Supporting Information for more details.
