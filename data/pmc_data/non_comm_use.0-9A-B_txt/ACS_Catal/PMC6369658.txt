1-Hexene
is an important α-olefin for polyethylene production
and is produced from ethene. Recent developments in the α-olefin
industry have led to the successful commercialization of ethene trimerization
catalysts. An important industrially applied ethene trimerization
system uses a mixture of chromium 2-ethylhexanoate, AlEt3, AlEt2Cl, and 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP). Here, we have
studied the activation of this system using catalytic and spectroscopic
experiments (XAS, EPR, and UV–vis) under conditions employed
in industry. First, chromium 2-ethylhexanoate was prepared and characterized
to be [Cr3O(RCO2)6(H2O)3]Cl. Next, the activation of chromium 2-ethylhexanoate with
AlEt3, AlEt2Cl, and DMP was studied, showing
immediate reduction (<5 ms) of the trinuclear Cr(III) carboxylate
and formation of a neutral polynuclear Cr(II) carboxylate complex.
Over time, this Cr(II) carboxylate complex is partially converted
into a chloro-bridged dinuclear Cr(II) pyrrolyl complex. In cyclohexane,
small quantities of an unknown Cr(I) complex (∼1% after 1 h)
are observed, while in toluene, the quantity of Cr(I) is much higher
(∼23% after 1 h). This is due to the formation of cationic
bis(tolyl)Cr(I) complexes, which likely leads to the observed inferior
performance using toluene as the reaction solvent. Catalytic studies
allow us to exclude some of the observed Cr(I) and Cr(II) complexes
as the active species in this catalytic system. Using this combination
of techniques, we have been able to structurally characterize complexes
of this selective Cr-catalyzed trimerization system under conditions
which are employed in industry.

1 Introduction
Linear α-olefins
(LAOs) enjoy a wide range of applications,
for example, in the production of plastics, detergents and surfactants.1 Typically, LAOs are produced by catalysts operating
via a mechanism which gives rise to a statistical product distribution.2 However, the demand for the shorter LAOs (1-butene,
1-hexene, and 1-octene) is rising due to their application in the
production of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).3 As a result of this changing market demand, companies such
as Sasol and Chevron Phillips Chemical have developed catalytic chromium
systems, which can selectively trimerize ethene to form 1-hexene.4,5 Selective ethene trimerization is believed to proceed via metallacyclic
intermediates (see Scheme 1); experimental evidence for this mechanism has been found
in deuterium labeling experiments.6 The
oxidation state of the metal during the catalytic cycle however is
subject to debate, and different experiments have suggested either
a Cr(I)/Cr(III)7−9 or a Cr(II)/Cr(IV)10−12 redox couple. Gaining
insights into the oxidation states of chromium during the catalytic
cycle is complicated by the paramagnetic nature of the various oxidation
states of chromium formed in these reactions.13 Strategies to probe the oxidation state of chromium involves the
application of spectroscopic techniques such as electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)10,14,15 and crystallization of self-activating
catalysts.7,8,16

Scheme 1 Proposed
Mechanism for the Selective Formation of 1-Hexene via Metallacyclic
Intermediates
The first ethene trimerization
system was successfully commercialized
by Chevron Phillips Chemical in Qatar (2003); annually 47 000 t of
1-hexene is produced in this plant. The system consists of chromium
2-ethylhexanoate, 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP), AlEt3, and
AlEt2Cl mixed in a molar ratio of 1:3:11:8, respectively
(see Scheme 2).17 Despite successful commercialization, limited
mechanistic studies have been reported in open academic literature.
Duchateau and Korobkov and co-workers have successfully isolated Cr(I),
Cr(II) and Cr(III) pyrrolyl complexes; some of these complexes were
found to be self-activating ethene trimerization catalysts (see Scheme 3 for an overview).
On the basis of the observed catalytic performance of these complexes,
the authors propose a Cr(I)/Cr(III) redox couple to be responsible
for catalysis.7,8,18 None
of the complexes was however isolated under the exact conditions employed
in industry, and different sources of chromium, aluminum alkyl reagents
and ligands have been used. In another study by Skobelev et al., performed
in the presence of ethene, a correlation between Cr(I) concentration
and catalytic activity was found using EPR spectroscopy, again in
favor of a Cr(I)/Cr(III) redox couple.9 The performed EPR experiments however did not provide insights in
the structure of the formed Cr(I) complexes nor in the structure of
the large quantity of EPR-silent complexes formed.

XAS has been shown to be a
useful spectroscopic technique which
allows for the determination of both oxidation state and structure
of homogeneous catalysts.19 A combination
of XAS and EPR was successfully applied by Brückner and co-workers
to study a Cr–{PNP} tetramerization system. In the performed
study, they propose the active species to be a (PNP)Cr(II)(CH3)2 complex; deactivation of the catalyst can occur
via reduction to Cr(I) in aromatic solvents.10,20 The performed XAS measurements required long acquisition times,
which could have prevented the observation of short-lived complexes
present within the solution.

To improve the time resolution
of XAS in homogeneous catalysis,
we have developed a freeze-quench XAS methodology.21 This methodology has allowed us to identify Cr(II) complexes
which are formed in the activation of a Cr–{SNS} and Cr–{PNP}
ethene trimerization and tetramerization system, respectively.14,15 In this study, we have combined the freeze-quench XAS methodology
with EPR and UV–vis measurements to follow the various stages
of preparation of the industrially applied Chevron Phillips Chemical
ethene trimerization catalyst. This combination of techniques has
allowed us to observe various Cr(I) and Cr(II) complexes which have
not been characterized previously in this industrially applied system.
Catalytic tests allow us to exclude some of the observed Cr(I) and
Cr(II) complexes as the active species in this system.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of the Chromium
Precursor
We started our study by preparing and characterizing
the chromium
precursor used by Chevron Phillips Chemical: chromium 2-ethylhexanoate.
Chromium 2-ethylhexanoate is generally assumed to be mononuclear in
nature with a general structure of Cr(2-EH)3 (2-EH = 2-ethylhexanoate)
and is sold by various commercial suppliers as a complex dissolved
in mineral oil. In patent and academic literature several protocols
describe the preparation of Cr(2-EH)3.22−25 The attempted synthesis of Cr(2-EH)3 from CrCl3·6H2O and sodium 2-ethylhexanoate
in THF and methanol gives rise to an oily product. The color of the
formed complex is affected by the choice of solvent (Figure S1). Mass spectrometry shows the formation of polynuclear
chromium complexes (Figure S2–S4). In a recent patent and literature publication by Chevron Phillips
Chemical, it is shown that the absence of water is important to the
form the mononuclear complex.23,26 Performing a synthesis
under inert and anhydrous conditions in THF, using CrCl3(THF)3, NaH, and 2-ethylhexanoic acid, gives rise to an
oily green product. Mass spectrometry does indeed show the formation
of the mononuclear complex, but significant amounts of polynuclear
products can also be identified (Figure S6). These findings led us to question the general formulation of the
structure of Cr(2-EH)3.

In a recent publication,
Jeon et al. describe the synthesis of a well-defined neutral chromium
precursor with the general structure Cr(2-EH)2OH.27 Via a slightly modified version of their synthetic
methods (using heptane instead of mineral oil as reaction solvent, Scheme 4) we managed to obtain
a pale purple amorphous solid with a yield of 51%. An unknown green
impurity was removed by filtration of the complex over silica, which
was not described in the original publication. The resulting complex
(Figure S7) shows absorption peaks at λ
= 408 nm (ε = 57 M–1 cm–1) and λ = 572 nm (ε = 74 M–1 cm–1). These absorption peaks are in agreement with the
results from Jeon et al. (λ = 407 nm and λ = 572 nm).
In addition, the absorption bands observed in the ATR-IR spectrum
of the product (Figure 1) matches closely with the FT-IR results obtained by Jeon et al.,
suggesting that a structurally similar complex is obtained. Based
on their performed characterization (cryoscopy, IR and elemental analysis),
the authors propose that the complex has the general structure Cr(2-EH)2OH. Our characterization of this material is however not in
line with this proposal.

Scheme 4 Preparation of the Chromium Precursor [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl
Figure 1 ATR-IR spectrum of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl. The inset of the figure shows
an enlargement of
the carboxylate stretches.

Part of an ESI+ spectrum of the obtained chromium precursor
is
depicted in Figure 2a. Visible in the mass spectrum, is a [Cr3O(2-EH)6]+ fragment (found m/z: 1030.47, calculated m/z: 1030.46).
Additional fragments are observed containing acetonitrile, for example,
[Cr3O(2-EH)6(ACN)2]+ (found m/z: 1112.54, calculated m/z: 1112.51) and [Cr3O(2-EH)6(ACN)3]+ (found m/z: 1153.58, calculated m/z: 1153.54). Formation of oxo-centered trinuclear chromium carboxylates
is well-described in the literature, and crystal structures of related
carboxylates have been investigated.28−30 Based on the observed
fragmentation pattern (Figure 2), a trinuclear complex of the general structure [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl is proposed, where
substitution of bound water for acetonitrile is observed in the ESI+
spectrum. Evidence of bound water can be found in the ESI+ spectrum,
where fragments [Cr3O(2-EH)6(OH)]+ (found m/z: 1047.52, calculated m/z: 1047.46) and [Cr3O(2-EH)6(ACN)(OH)]+ (found m/z: 1088.52, calculated m/z: 1088.49)
are observed to be caused by loss of a proton from bound water. In Figure 2b, the ESI+ spectrum
is shown in the range of 450 m/z to 2000 m/z. Minor other fragments
are observed, but these cannot be linked to a molecular structure.
Further confirmation of the ionic nature of the molecule is found
in the elemental analysis (Calculated: C, 51.44; H, 8.63; Cl, 3.16;
Cr 13.92. Found: C, 51.19; H, 8.90, Cl, 3.09; Cr 13.92), which provides
confirmation of the chloride anion in the structure of the isolated
complex.

which are assigned to trinuclear chromium species and (b) an overview
of all observed fragments up to m/z = 2000. Text above fragmentation pattern is used to assign some
of the observed species.

The attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared (IR) spectrum
of
the complex is shown in Figure 1; the inset shows an enlargement of the carboxylate stretches
of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl.
A stretch is observed at νOH = 3628 cm–1, which can be ascribed to the hydroxyl stretching vibration of water
bound to the chromium complex. Small traces of free acid are visible
(νCOOH = 1707 cm–1); these traces
could not be removed from the complex even after several steps of
washing with acetone. The carboxylate stretches are observed at νsym = 1525 cm–1 and νasy = 1423 cm–1. A small shoulder is observed for
the symmetric carboxylate stretch; in this region, however, also H2O bending vibrations are to be expected. The carboxylate stretches
deviate from what is typically observed in the literature for other
chromium carboxylates (for chromium acetate: νsym = 1620 cm–1 and νasy = 1450 cm–1).31 One explanation for
this difference could be the long aliphatic chains of chromium(III)
2-ethylhexanoate, promoting aggregation and causing a slight distortion
of its molecular structure. In this regard, cobalt(II) 2-ethylhexanoate
is known to aggregate and form reverse micelles in hydrocarbon solvents.32 Finally, a strong absorption band is observed
around ν = 540 cm–1; this band can be ascribed
to asymmetric stretching of the [Cr3O] core of the complex
as is also observed for other oxo-centered chromium carboxylates.33

Additional evidence of the trinuclear
structure of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl is found in EPR
spectroscopy. Magnetic measurements of other trinuclear chromium carboxylates
have revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the chromium
atoms in the [Cr3O] core.28,30 These antiferromagnetic
interactions gives rise to a doublet ground state and a thermally
accessible quartet excited state. EPR measurements of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl in toluene performed
at variable temperatures are depicted in Figure S10. At 15K and 40K a broad resonance is observed with a g-value
of ∼1.93. This broad resonance is typical for an S = 3/2 complex
with a small zero field splitting.34 At
8K, an additional sharp resonance becomes visible with a g-value of
∼1.95; the observation of this resonance at lower temperature
is in line with population of the S = 1/2 ground state.

In addition,
the geometry of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl in toluene was probed via Cr K-edge
XAS. The k2-weighted Fourier transform
of the Cr K-edge EXAFS data for [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl is shown in Figure 3. The obtained EXAFS parameters and a comparison
to a DFT optimized structure is shown in Table 1. Three shells are used to obtain a fit for
the data. The first shell is an oxygen shell containing 6.3(8) atoms
at a distance of 1.98(1) Å. It is not possible to identify a
separate oxygen shell for the mu-oxo (1.881(3) Å) or for bound
water (2.175(7) Å) as the Cr–O distances are too similar
to be distinguished with our data quality. The second shell is a carbon
shell containing four atoms at a distance of 2.95(3) Å. This
carbon shell is assigned to the carbons contained in the bridging
carboxylates. The third shell is a chromium shell containing two atoms
at a distance of 3.42(2) Å and is assigned to chromium atoms
contained within the [Cr3O] core.

Å, R2 = 0.017, fitting was performed
in R-space with a k-weighting of k1-k3. The DFT structure of
[Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]+ was calculated without taking into account the anion. DFT
calculated distances were calculated by averaging the distances to
the metal centers of the various contributors contained within a shell.
The standard deviation is given for both the experimental data and
for the DFT calculated structure. Calculations are reported for the
quartet state using BP86-d3/TZP.

DFT calculations on the BP86-d3/TZP level
were performed
to compare experimental bond lengths to calculated bond lengths (see Table 1). This level of theory
does not accurately predict a doublet ground state for the complex:
the quartet spin state is favored over the doublet spin state. This
is presumably due to pure density functionals such as BP86 favoring
low spin states over high spin states.35 Nevertheless, only minor geometrical differences are observed between
the two spin states, and the geometry of the quartet spin state is
thus used to compare to the experimental data.

The experimental
Cr–C and Cr–O bond lengths are in
excellent agreement with the performed calculations and only minor
differences (∼0.03 Å) are observed. A much larger deviation
is however observed for the Cr–Cr distance. Comparison of the
DFT structure of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]+ with trinuclear chromium propionate shows that
the calculated Cr–Cr distance (∼3.26 Å) matches
closely with the crystal structure (∼3.27 Å).36 This level of theory is thus sufficient to model
the Cr–Cr distance in trinuclear chromium carboxylates. Elongation
of the Cr–Cr distance is however observed in some trinuclear
chromium carboxylates, that is, in fluorinated chromium carboxylates
(∼3.34 Å) or in chromium carboxylates contained in metalorganic
frameworks (∼3.42 Å and ∼3.48 Å).37−39 The elongated Cr–Cr distance is thus not unusual, its origin
however remains unknown.

2.2 Catalytic Screening of
[Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl
With an understanding
of the structure of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl, the performance of the catalyst was assessed.
Activation of the catalyst was achieved by reaction of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl (1 equiv) with
AlEt3 (11 equiv), AlEt2Cl (8 equiv), and DMP
(3 equiv).40Table 2 shows the catalytic tests performed under
1 bar of C2H4 in toluene and cyclohexane.41 The choice of solvent has a large effect on
the performance of the catalyst. Performing the reaction in an aliphatic
solvent leads to a 10-fold increase in activity compared with an aromatic
solvent. Reduced activity in aromatic solvents is also known from
the patent literature: cyclohexane is often used as the reaction solvent.40 The origin of the reduced performance of the
chromium-pyrrolyl system in aromatic solvents is still unclear. Suggestions
have been made that toluene coordinates to a Cr(I) active species
to form an arene complex and poisoning the catalyst in the process.8 Similar deactivation pathways have been observed
in related Cr–{PNP} tri- and tetramerization systems.10,20,42

d RT = room temperature. Traces of
decenes (<1 mol %) were observed in all performed experiments.

Increasing the reaction temperature
from room temperature to 50
°C leads to a roughly 2-fold increase of the activity of the
catalyst in both aromatic and aliphatic solvents. Limited formation
of polyethylene (PE) is observed in all performed reactions.

Only minor differences are observed between [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl and a commercial source of
“Cr(2-EH)3”. Ascribing differences between
these two sources of chromium 2-ethylhexanoate is difficult due to
the unknown nature of the commercial source (Strem). Mass spectrometry,
elemental analysis, and XAS analysis of the commercial source however
also indicate the presence of trinuclear, ionic complexes in the commercial
source of chromium 2-ethylhexanoate (Supporting Information 2.4).

In Table 3, the
results are shown for the reaction performed under 50 bar of C2H4 at 90 °C. A 15-fold increased activity
is observed in cyclohexane with respect to toluene; roughly similar
to what is also observed under 1 bar of C2H4. The activities observed are in close agreement with values reported
in patent literature.40

2.3 Reaction of 2,5-Dimethylpyrrole with Triethylaluminum
and Diethylaluminum Chloride
Before the catalyst is activated,
DMP is first reacted with a mixture of AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl. This solution is subsequently used to activate chromium
2-ethylhexanoate.40 The reaction between
AlEt3 and DMP and AlEt2Cl and DMP was studied
by Jeon et al., but so far no reports have been made of the reaction
between a mixture of AlEt3, AlEt2Cl, and DMP.27 We therefore applied multinuclear NMR techniques
and DFT to study the reaction between DMP (3 equiv) and AlEt3 (11 equiv) and AlEt2Cl (8 equiv) in both aromatic solvents
and aliphatic solvents. In addition, we expanded on the structural
assignment made by Jeon et al. for the reaction between AlEt3 (19 equiv) and DMP (3 equiv) and AlEt2Cl (19 equiv) and
DMP (3 equiv); all of our results are summarized in Supporting Information 4.1 and 4.3.

The reactions were
performed by premixing AlEt3 (11 equiv) and AlEt2Cl (8 equiv) in an aromatic or aliphatic solvent. DMP (3 equiv) was added
dropwise to this solution, and the solution was stirred for 10 min.
The solutions were briefly exposed to vacuum at 0 °C, to remove
any volatiles, after which deuterated solvents (toluene-d8 or cyclohexane-d12) were introduced. Three products can
be identified that are formed during the reaction (Scheme 5 and Figure 4): adduct c and d and aminoalane f. Ten minutes after the reagents are
mixed, unreacted DMP resonances can still be identified (Figure 4i), but was found
to be completely consumed after 30 min (Figure 4ii). In addition, a reaction mixture aged
for 3 days shows no change in composition of the solution (Figure S38b). Only minor differences in composition
of the solution were observed in toluene and cyclohexane.

with AlEt3 (11 equiv) and AlEt2Cl (8 equiv)
Red depicts the observed quantity
of the compound in toluene, blue depicts the observed quantity of
the compound in cyclohexane and italics depicts the electronic energy
(ΔE) of the given transformation. The amount
of d was not quantified; it was found to be very minor
compared with complex c and complex f. Contents
of the reaction mixture do not change any further after all DMP has
been consumed. Resonances of d could not be observed
in cyclohexane-d12, as it was not possible to cool the
solution to −40 °C due to the high melting point of the
solvent.

Figure 4 Overview of the alkenyl resonances for the reaction
between DMP
(3 equiv) and AlEt2Cl (8 equiv) and AlEt3 (11
equiv) in toluene-d8. Shown in the figure are the 1H NMR spectra of (i) the reaction measured after 10 min (ii)
the reaction measured after 30 min and (iii) a reaction mixture cooled
to −40 °C. Letters are used to assign resonances to species;
the same coding is used as in Scheme 5. In addition, an asterisk is used to denote unreacted
DMP.

The formation of c can be concluded on the basis of
the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 4ii) and 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S39): three novel resonances are observed caused by
rearrangement of the double bond. In addition, two resonances for
the methyl moieties are observed for c (δH = 1.92 and 0.83 ppm) due to desymmetrization of the pyrrolyl ring.
DFT calculations show that the formation of this adduct is favorable
(ΔE = −5.4 kcal/mol; Supporting Information 5.4).

The resonances of d are very similar to the resonances
observed for c. These resonances are broadened at room
temperature, but can be observed at −40 °C. Interestingly,
the aromatic proton resonances contained within the pyrrolyl moiety d can be observed as a separate resonance in the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectrum (δH = 5.94
ppm and δC = 97.32 ppm) (Figure 4iii and Figure S39b). Only a very minor amount of the total amount of DMP present is
converted into d (<1%). DFT calculations show the
formation of this adduct to be slightly favorable (ΔE = −0.9 kcal/mol; Supporting Information 5.4).

The formation of aminoalane f can be concluded on
the basis of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
(Figure 4iii and Figure S39): a single resonance for the aromatic
moiety is observed (δH = 5.72 ppm and δC = 105.70 ppm) and a single resonance for the methyl moiety
is observed (δH = 2.24 ppm and δC = 16.80 ppm).

DFT calculations were employed to evaluate the
relative electronic
energy of various aminoalane dimers that can be formed in the presence
of both AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl (see Supporting Information 5.4). The formation of aminoalane f is found to be most favored (ΔE =
−34.5 kcal/mol). Various other aminoalane dimers however do
have very similar electronic energies compared to f,
and we considered the possibility of chemical exchange at room temperature.
Splitting of the resonances of f is however not observed
when the reaction mixture was cooled to −40 °C (Figure
4iii), showing that the resonances of f arise from a
single complex.

The observed aluminum complexes (see Scheme 5) will all be present
when a chromium 2-ethylhexanoate
solution is activated. In addition to these aluminum complexes, large
excesses of AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl still are present
after the reaction with DMP. The performed NMR experiments show that
DMP reacts solely with AlEt3 (Supporting Information 4.1 and 4.3). Three equivalents of AlEt3 are thus required to deprotonate DMP prior to reaction with
chromium, and the reaction mixture thus consists of the observed aluminum
pyrrolyl complexes and eight equivalents of both AlEt3 and
AlEt2Cl.

2.4 Spectroscopic Investigation
of the Activation
of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]
With an understanding of the products formed in the reaction of
DMP with AlEt3 and AlEt2Cl, we set out to investigate
the activation of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl. A variety of spectroscopic techniques were applied
(EPR, XAS, and UV–vis) to probe both geometry and electronic
structure of the activated metal center in both toluene and cyclohexane.
Throughout each of the experiments reported below, we employed a stoichiometry
of 1:3:11:8 with respect to Cr, DMP, AlEt3, and AlEt2Cl. Activation of chromium was typically performed via premixing
of DMP, AlEt3, and AlEt2Cl, after which [Cr3O(2-EH)6)(H2O)3]Cl was added
to this solution.

2.4.1 Activation of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl Followed
by Stopped-Flow UV–vis
The stopped-flow UV–vis
spectra for the activation of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl (1) in cyclohexane and toluene
are presented in Figure 5. 1 shows two absorption bands
at 411 and 572 nm. Upon activation of 1 in cyclohexane,
an immediate shift (<5 ms) in absorption bands is observed, and
a novel band is observed at 580 nm. Another absorption band is observed
around 410 nm, but could not be properly assigned as it overlaps with
a rising charge-transfer (CT) band. These changes are accompanied
by the solution immediately becoming turbid after activation. This
increase in turbidity gives rise to a general increase of the absorption
of the solution due to scattering of the formed particles (Figure 5a). Over time, disappearance
of the absorption bands at 410 and 580 nm is observed, and a novel
absorption band appears at 471 nm. No other absorption bands can be
distinguished, presumably due to overlap with the CT band.

Figure 5 Activation
of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl
(1 equiv, 5 mM) by AlEt3 (11 equiv), AlEt2Cl
(8 equiv) and DMP (3 equiv) followed by stopped-flow UV–vis
in (a) cyclohexane and (b) toluene. The concentration of Cr in the
solution is 3.75 mM in both experiments.

After 10 min, the solution becomes clear again, and the general
absorption of the solution diminishes due to consumption of the formed
particles (either via reaction or dissolution). The consumption rate
of the particles was estimated by following the absorption of the
background (900 nm) in time and follow approximate first-order reaction
kinetics (Figure S47).

A very similar
activation pathway is observed in toluene (Figure 5b). Immediately after
activation (<5 ms) of 1, novel absorption bands are
visible at 410 and 580 nm. These absorption bands are similar to the
ones observed in cyclohexane; however, in toluene, the solution remains
clear after activation. On a time scale of 10 min, disappearance of
the absorption bands at 410 and 580 nm is observed and a rising CT
band becomes visible. An additional absorption band is observed, which
coincides with the rising CT band. It was not possible to accurately
assign the wavelength of this absorption band. The observed changes
in the UV–vis spectrum are accompanied by isosbestic points
at 545 and 679 nm. The changes can again be modeled via first-order
reaction kinetics (Figure S48) and show
a slower conversion in toluene compared to cyclohexane.

2.4.2 Activation of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl Followed by EPR
EPR
spectroscopy was applied to obtain information about the oxidation
state of the metal after activation. The activation of this system
in cyclohexane using EPR spectroscopy has already been studied in
detail by Skobelev et al. In their study, the majority of the solution
was found to be EPR-silent and a small fraction of a pyrrole-coordinated
Cr(I) complex was observed. To build on their results, we investigated
the activation in both cyclohexane and toluene to observe any possible
differences in composition in an aromatic solvent and aliphatic solvent;
our results are presented in Figure 6. The temperature-dependent EPR spectra of 1 have already been discussed in detail (section 2.1) and will not be discussed here.

Figure 6 EPR spectra
at 20K of (a) [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl (toluene, 10 mM in Cr), (b) [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3 (cyclohexane, 8.46
mM in Cr) activated with AlEt3 (11 equiv), AlEt2Cl (8 equiv), and DMP (3 equiv), and (c) [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3 (toluene, 9.09 mM in Cr) activated
with AlEt3 (11 equiv), AlEt2Cl (8 equiv), and
DMP (3 equiv). Reaction times are shown in the figure. The inset shows
an enlargement of the observed Cr(I) resonances.

Activation of 1 in cyclohexane (Figure 6b) leads to rapid disappearance
of its resonances:
very minor amounts of 1 are observable after 2 min (Figure 6 and Figure S51). After 2 min a novel isotropic Cr(I)
resonance is visible with a g-value of gx,y,z = 1.988.
Quantitative EPR experiments performed at room temperature (Figure S49), using TEMPO as an external spin
probe, show that <1% of all chromium present is converted into
this Cr(I) complex after an hour. The rest of the chromium is thus
present as EPR-silent complexes (either as dinuclear Cr(I) complex
or Cr(II) complex).

Skobelev et al.; ascribe the observed Cr(I)
resonance to the formation
of a Cr(I) pyrrolyl complex.9 The Cr(I)
complex observed in this study might be different from the Cr(I) complex
observed by Skobelev et al. as the symmetry of the line shape is different
(current study: isotropic, previous study: axial). We only observed
partially resolved superhyperfine splitting for the Cr(I) complex
at room temperature (Figure S52) and we
could not draw any conclusions on whether pyrrole is coordinated to
the observed Cr(I) complex.

Relating UV–vis (Figure 6b) and EPR (Figure 5a) provides information
about changes in the oxidation
state of chromium over time. Quantitative EPR experiments show rapid
reduction of 1 upon reaction with aluminum alkyl reagents.
Within 2 min most of 1 is consumed and is transformed
into EPR-silent complexes. These results suggest that the changes
observed in the UV–vis on short time scales (<2 min) is
due to a reduction of the catalyst via formation of an EPR-silent
complex (2). UV–vis shows transformation of 2 into another complex (3); from EPR it can be
concluded that 3 is also EPR-silent. EPR also shows the
formation of a Cr(I) complex, which is present in low concentrations
(<1%). Due to the low concentration of this Cr(I) complex, it is
unlikely that this complex is observable using UV–vis; these
EPR resonances are thus assigned to another complex (4).

Similar observations are made when the activation of 1 is performed in toluene. The resonances arising from 1 disappear rapidly (Figure 6c and Figure S53), and an
axial
Cr(I) resonance appears with g-values of gx,y = 1.977 and
gz = 2.001. The resonances in toluene
are different compared to the ones observed in cyclohexane, as different
g-values and symmetry of the line shapes are observed (isotropic and
axial respectively); the resonances observed in toluene can thus be
assigned to another Cr(I) complex (5) unrelated to 4.

Quantitative EPR shows that the concentration of 5 is much higher compared to the concentration of 4.
Around 23% of the total chromium content of the solution is converted
into 5 after 1 h.43 No other
resonances are observed after activation, showing that again a large
fraction of EPR-silent chromium complexes are being formed. It is
known that a Cr(III) source, an aluminum alkyl compound, and an aromatic
solvent can be used to prepare cationic bis(arene)Cr(I) complexes.44 In addition, the formation of cationic bis(arene)Cr(I)
complexes has been observed in other selective ethene oligomerization
systems by Bercaw and co-workers and Brückner and co-workers.10,20,42 Based on the much higher Cr(I)
concentration in toluene compared to cyclohexane and the absence of 5 in cyclohexane, 5 is proposed to be a bis(tolyl)Cr(I)
complex. We were not capable of resolving any superhyperfine splitting
for 5, even when the modulation amplitude was lowered
from 4G to 1G (Figure S52). No conclusions
can be made about the presence of 4 in toluene, as the
resonances of 5 dominate the EPR spectrum.

Comparison
of UV–vis and EPR results in toluene again provides
information about the oxidation state of the catalyst after activation.
EPR spectroscopy reveals immediate reduction of 1 and
formation of 5 and large quantities of EPR-silent complexes.
Very similar absorption bands in toluene and cyclohexane are observed
immediately after activation of 1; these results thus
also suggest formation of 2 in toluene. Over time, disappearance
of the absorption bands of 2 is observed and a strong
CT band is observed. The CT band likely originates from 5 as bis(arene)Cr(I) complexes have been shown to have strong CT bands
in a similar region.45 Due to the intense
CT band, it cannot be concluded whether 3 is also being
formed in toluene.

2.4.3 Activation Followed by
Freeze-Quench Cr
K-Edge EXAFS
Although EPR and UV–vis spectroscopy
provide important information about the oxidation state and kinetics
of the metal during activation, no structural information is obtained.
We therefore applied Cr K-edge XAS to follow the activation of 1 in toluene and cyclohexane.

An overview of the Cr
K-edge EXAFS data in cyclohexane and toluene is presented in Figure 7. The EXAFS fitting
parameters are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5. The processed EXAFS data can be found in Supporting Information 8. The EXAFS analysis of 1 was already discussed in detail and was shown to be in line with
the formation of a trinuclear Cr(III) carboxylate.

in Cr) and the corresponding k2-weighted
EXAFS oscillations in (c) cyclohexane and (d) toluene. The k-range used in the Fourier transform for each data set
was from 3.40 to 11.40 Å–2 and a k-weighting of k = 2 was employed.

b After 30 min and 3 h a mixture of
various complex is present. It was not possible to assign the relative
contribution to the EXAFS spectrum for each of these complexes due
to the lack of parameters. The number depicted in the entry coordination
shell is the actual parameter used in the EXAFS fit and was used to
obtained the fit.

c A restraint
for the Cr–Cl
distance (range: 2.30–2.42 Å) was applied to model this
shell; the absence of this restraint gave rise to an unrealistically
short Cr–Cl distance.

2.4.3.1 Activation of the Precursor in Cyclohexane
Addition
of aluminum alkyl activators to 1 leads to
immediate changes (<10 s) in the observed EXAFS, followed by slower
changes over 3 h.

The EPR and UV–vis results show that
the majority species at short reaction times (<2 min) is EPR-silent
complex 2. This species is thus also being probed at
short reaction times (10 s and 2 min) in the performed XAS experiments.
EXAFS analysis of a reaction mixture frozen after 2 min (Figure S57 and Table S18) reveals identical coordination
shells (Cr–O, Cr–C, and Cr–Cr) and bond distances
as was observed for 1. These observations suggest that 2 has a very similar structure compared with 1. For the Cr–O coordination shell, however, a reduction of
the coordination number from 6.3(8) to 3.9(4) is observed. On the
basis of these observations, we propose that 2 is a neutral
polynuclear Cr(II) carboxylate species; using only the EXAFS data
we cannot deduce the nuclearity of 2.

DFT calculations
were employed to explore the feasibility of formation
of a neutral Cr(II) carboxylate from an ionic Cr(III) carboxylate
(Supporting Information 8.1) in the presence
of aluminum alkyl reagents. We envisioned that the bound water and
central oxygen atom would easily be lost in the presence of aluminum
alkyl reagents. Starting from trinuclear chromium acetate (S = 3/2), bound water is easily lost from chromium via reaction
with AlEt3 (ΔE= −97.3 kcal/mol
and ΔG = −170.0 kcal/mol), giving rise
to a five-coordinate Cr(III) carboxylate (S = 3/2).
Subsequent alkylation and reduction of the Cr(III) carboxylate complex
to form a trinuclear neutral Cr(II) carboxylate complex (S = 2) is also found to be very favorable (ΔE= −50.0 kcal/mol and ΔG = −61.4
kcal/mol).

The EPR and UV–vis results show conversion
of 2 to EPR-silent complex 3 at longer reaction
times (>10
min). Structural changes are evident from the Cr K-edge EXAFS results:
at longer reaction times (10 min, 30 min, and 3 h), an additional
coordination shell becomes visible (Figure 7a and Table 4).

Care had to be taken in the EXAFS analysis,
as EPR and UV–vis
spectroscopy indicates a mixture of (at least) three complexes (2, 3, and 4). Because of the low
concentration of 4, it is unlikely that this complex
will significantly contribute to the EXAFS oscillations. We managed
to successfully fit the EXAFS oscillations at longer reaction times
(10 min, 30 min, and 3 h) by assuming conversion of a polynuclear
Cr(II) carboxylate (2) to a dinuclear Cr(II) pyrrolyl
complex (3) (see Scheme 6). This structural assignment was obtained by first
introducing coordination shells and optimizing the corresponding coordination
numbers and bond distances. Next, the obtained bond distances and
coordination numbers were compared to crystal structures of Cr pyrrolyl
complexes and Cr carboxylate complexes in the literature, and likely
structures of the two observed complexes were proposed. Finally, an
additional parameter was introduced and optimized to describe the
relative concentration of the two observed complexes; this parameter
is depicted in Table 4. Our findings for the EXAFS analysis of a reaction mixture frozen
after 30 min are discussed below.

Scheme 6 Incomplete Conversion of the Initially
Formed Cr(II) Carboxylate
Complex (2) to a Cr(II) Pyrrolyl Complex (3)
It should be noted that the
nuclearity of 2 is unknown and is drawn as trinuclear
for illustrative purposes.

A total of three
coordination shells are required to obtain a fit
for the reaction mixture frozen after 30 min. EXAFS analysis reveals
that 66% is converted into 3. The presence of 2 inside the reaction mixture can be concluded based on the presence
of a Cr–O coordination shell containing four atoms observed
at a distance of 1.97(1) Å. A similar coordination shell was
also observed for reaction mixtures frozen after 10 s and 2 min and
is indicative of the presence of bridging carboxylates. The presence
of 3 can be concluded on the basis of the presence of
a Cr–C and Cr–Cl coordination shell. The Cr–C
shell is observed at a distance of 2.31(2) Å and contains five
atoms. The Cr–Cl shell is observed at a distance of 2.38(2)
Å and contains two atoms. The observed distance and coordination
number of the carbon shell is in line with π-coordination of
the pyrrolyl ring to the metal center.46 In addition, the chloride distances are in line with bridging coordination
of the chlorides.46 We thus assign 3 to the formation of a chloro-bridged dinuclear Cr(II) pyrrolyl
complex. The ability of Cr(II) pyrrolyl complexes to form dinuclear
complexes is observed for other pyrrolyl ligands in the literature.8,46

Similar EXAFS fitting results are obtained for the sample
frozen
after 10 min (Figure S59 and Table S19)
and 3 h (Figure S63 and Table S21). After
10 min, 50% is converted into 3, and after 3 h, 85% is
converted into 3. Interestingly, for the sample frozen
after 3 h, it was possible to improve the fit by including a chromium
shell containing one atom at a distance of 2.94(4) Å. This chromium
shell is assigned to 3 and provides further evidence
for its dinuclear structure.

EXAFS can typically only probe
the first coordination sphere of
complexes in solution. We therefore applied DFT calculations on the
BP86-d3/TZP level of theory to obtain more information
about the geometry of 3 (Supporting Information 8.2). It is possible for a dinuclear Cr(II) pyrrolyl
complexes to adopt either a planar structure (Scheme 7A) or a butterfly structure (Scheme 7B).46 Performing the calculations in the absence of any aluminum alkyl
compounds shows that the butterfly geometry is slightly favored over
the planar geometry (ΔE = 1.1 kcal/mol).

Scheme 7 Overview of the (A) Planar Geometry and (B) Butterfly Geometry, Which
Can Be Adopted by Dinuclear Cr(II) Pyrrolyl Complexes
The substituent for the two
conformations that were taken into account in DFT calculations were
C6H8N, C6H8NAlEt3, C6H8NAlEtCl(DMP), and C6H8NAlEt2Cl.

It has been demonstrated
that the lone pair of the nitrogen can
form a dative bond with aluminum alkyl compounds present in the reaction
mixture.8 We therefore took into account
dative bond formation with several aluminum alkyl reagents (AlEt2Cl, AlEt3, and AlEtClDMP). The calculations indeed
show that adduct formation is favored; formation of an adduct with
AlEt2Cl is found to be most favored. In the presence of
aluminum alkyl reagents, the planar geometry (Scheme 7A) becomes favored over the butterfly geometry
(Scheme 7B). In the
case of adduct formation with AlEt2Cl, the difference between
planar and butterfly geometry is found to be ΔE = 6.7 kcal/mol in the singlet state. The Cr–Cl distances
(calculated: 2.36(3) Å, experimental: 2.38(2) Å), the Cr–C
distances (calculated: 2.36(3) Å, experimental: 2.38(3) Å)
and the Cr–Cr distances (calculated: 2.87 Å, experimental:
2.94(3) Å) obtained from the performed calculations match closely
with the experimental values.

Interesting is the close resemblance
between our proposed structure
and self-activating catalysts isolated by Duchateau and Korobkov and
co-workers, as depicted in Scheme 3.7,8,18 Structural
resemblence between our proposed structure and these self-activating
catalysts include a π-bound ligand and formation of a dative
bond with aluminum. Two of these self-activating catalysts are also
dinuclear in nature. Closest in structural resemblence, is the self-activating
Cr(II) catalyst which is depicted in Scheme 3b. In this complex, however, the bridging
position is occupied by methyl substituents and the complex takes
on a butterfly geometry.

2.4.3.2 Activation of the Precursor
in Toluene
EXAFS analysis (Figure 7b and Table 5) of 1 activated in toluene shows similar
trends as
compared to what is observed in cyclohexane on short time scales (<10
min). The mixtures frozen after 10 s (Figure S65 and Table S22) and 2 min (Figure S67 and Table S23) again show the presence of 2; similar
coordination numbers and shells are observed as were required to perform
the fit in cyclohexane.

EXAFS analysis of 1 activated
after 10 min (Figure S69 and Table S24)
in toluene shows the formation of a mixture of 2 and 3 with a relative contribution of 69% ± 20% and 31% ±
9% of the two complexes, respectively. It was possible to include
a Cr–Cl shell at a distance of 2.36(3) Å, which is indicative
of the formation of 3. It was not possible to include
a separate Cr–C shell for the pyrrolyl ring due to limitations
in the quality of the data. Comparison of these relative contributions
with the ones obtained in cyclohexane (Table 4) reveals slower conversion in toluene, in
line with the observed slower kinetics in the performed stopped-flow
UV–vis experiments.

EXAFS analysis of 1 activated
after 30 min (Figure S71 and Table S25)
and 3 h (Figure S73 and Table S26) is highly
complicated
due to the overlap of the coordination shells of multiple species
present. EPR and UV–vis spectroscopy show the presence of at
least three complexes (2, 3, and 5). As a result, it was not possible to accurately determine the relative
contributions of each of the species within the EXAFS spectra.

EXAFS analysis of 1 activated after 30 min suggest
the presence of 2, 3, and 5. In the fit, a Cr–C shell at a distance 3.04(4) Å and
the Cr–Cr shell at a distance of 3.35(4) Å had to be included,
indicative of the presence of 2. An additional Cr–C/Cr–O
shell was found at a distance of 2.06(2) Å. The observed Cr–C/Cr–O
did not match the expected Cr–C distance observed for [Cr(C6H6)2]I (2.13(4) Å).47 Presumably this mismatch arises due to overlap
of the Cr–O shell of 2 and the Cr–C shell
of 5, causing an average to be observed. Finally, the
presence of 3 can be concluded based on the observed
Cr–Cl shell at a distance of 2.34(2) Å. It was not possible
to include a separate shell for the Cr–C shell of the pyrrolyl
ring.

After 3 h, presumably 2 is mostly consumed
as it was
not possible to include a Cr–C shell or a Cr–Cr shell
for 2. The presence of 5 can be concluded
on the basis of the observed Cr–C shell at a distance of 2.12(2)
Å and was found to match closely with the expected Cr–C
distance (2.13(4) Å).47 Finally, the
presence of 3 can be concluded based on the observation
of a Cr–Cl shell at a distance of 2.33(1) Å. To come to
a successful fit, an additional Cr–Cr shell at a distance of
2.69(5) Å had to be included. Interestingly, the observed Cr–Cr
distance is shorter in toluene compared to cyclohexane (2.94(3) Å);
these results suggest that the choice of solvent might have an influence
on the geometry of 3.

2.4.4 Activation
Followed by Freeze-Quench Cr
K-Edge XANES
The observed Cr K-edge XANES data in cyclohexane
and toluene are depicted in Figure 8a,b. In cyclohexane, 1 shows an absorption
edge at 6001.7 eV. Activation of 1 leads to an immediate
shift in absorption edge to 6000.9 eV. In addition to these changes,
the whiteline intensity decreases and the intensity of the pre-edge
feature increases. Over time, the position of the edge changes further
and is 5994.1 eV after 30 min. These additional changes are accompanied
by a further decrease in the whiteline intensity and a further increase
in the intensity of the pre-edge features. In addition, isosbestic
points are observed at 6004.9 and 6029.0 eV. In toluene similar trends
are observed, but these changes occur more slowly, in line with the
slower kinetics observed in the stopped-flow UV–vis measurements.
Additional features also appear after longer reaction times (>10
min),
possibly due to the presence of bis(tolyl)Cr(I) complexes. These features
were found to match closely with a known reference of [Cr(C6H6)2]I (Figure S75).

Figure 8 Cr K-edge XANES data of the activation of [Cr3O(2-EH)6(H2O)3]Cl (by DMP (3 equiv), AlEt3 (11 equiv), and AlEt2Cl (8 equiv) at various points
in time in (a) cyclohexane (14.6 mM in Cr) and (b) toluene (16.7 mM
in Cr).

Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful
in simulating the observed
changes using the ab initio self-consistent field, real space, full
multiple scattering methodology implemented in FEFF 9.0.48 Comparison of an experimental and calculated
spectrum of a known standard, [Cr(C6H6)2]I (Figure S75), shows large discrepancies
between the calculated and observed edge position and shape. Likely
FEFF9.0 cannot be applied to model spectra of π-bound ligands.
The observed trends can however be rationalized. Upon activation of 1, an immediate edge shift to lower energies is observed.
This shift in edge position is in line with the reduction of complex 1 to form complex 2. Over time, the position
of the edge shifts even further by more than 6 eV. FEFF9 calculations
performed on the Cr-{SNS} show that substitution of chlorides into
a complex can lead to an edge shift toward lower energies.14 The observed edge shift to lower energies over
time can thus be understood to arise from substitution of carboxylates
by chlorides in the conversion of 2 to 3.

2.5 Correlation of Spectroscopic Data and Catalytic
Data
The various observed species are summarized in Scheme 8. The concentration
of the complexes formed vary over time and complicate the identification
of the complex which is responsible for the generation of the active
species. Upon activation of 1 immediate conversion to 2 is observed. Over longer time scales (>10 min), the concentration
of 2 diminishes and 3 is formed. The conversion
of 2 to 3 proceeds more slowly in toluene
compared to cyclohexane, as is observed by both stopped-flow UV–vis
and Cr K-edge XAS. In addition to the formation of 3,
also the formation of 4 is observed in cyclohexane and 5 is observed in toluene. The structure of 4 remains
unknown. Using quantitative EPR it is possible to accurately determine
the amount of 4 (<1% after an hour) and 5 (∼23% after an hour). The relative concentration of 2 and 3 over time can be determined using the
Cr K-edge EXAFS data, but the error margin is relatively high.

Scheme 8 Overview of the Various Species Formed upon Activation of 1 in the Presence of AlEt2Cl (8 equiv), AlEt3 (11 equiv), and DMP (3 equiv)
The catalyst is active in both cyclohexane and toluene
(Table 2), indicating
that
the active species is generated in both solvents. This allows us to
exclude 5 as a candidate for the active species as it
is exclusively formed in toluene. The reduced performance of the catalyst
in toluene suggests that formation of bis(tolyl)Cr(I) complexes leads
to diminished performance of the catalyst.

The concentration
of 2, 3, and 4 is time-dependent:
over time, 2 is consumed,
and 3 and 4 are formed. A catalytic experiment
was performed where the turnover number was followed as a function
of time for a catalyst prepared via in situ activation and a catalyst
aged for 3 and 21 h; the results are depicted in Figure S76. These experiments were performed under 1 bar of
ethene at room temperature. Very limited dependency of the performance
of the catalyst on the aging time is observed.

This allows us
to exclude 2 as a candidate for the
active species, as the concentration of 2 will be very
low after aging the catalytic system for 21 h. This also makes 3 to be less likely for the active species, as the concentration
of 3 shows a large variation over time; low initial productivity
would be expected for the catalyst prepared via in situ activation.
The aging behavior makes 4 a more likely candidate for
the generation of the active species, as the concentration of 4 varies very little over time (Figure S49). Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude 3, as it is present during all performed catalytic tests. Alternatively, 3 and 4 could possibly both not participate in
catalysis and catalysis might be performed by a minority, unobservable
chromium complex. Similar suggestions have been made by Bercaw and
co-workers in the spectroscopic investigation of a Cr–{PNP}
trimerization system.42

Additionally,
the performed spectroscopic experiments have not
been done in the presence of ethene. While the catalytic system is
active under 1 bar of ethene, the catalytic system might undergo further
changes in the presence of ethene. For example, Korobkov and co-workers
have suggested heterolytic dissocation of a dinuclear tetramethylpyrrole
Cr(II) complex (Scheme 3b) to be the pathway via which an active Cr(I) species is generated.8 Future spectroscopic experiments in the presence
of ethene are underway to gain more insight into any additional changes
the catalytic system undergoes in the presence of ethene.

3 Conclusions
In this study, chromium complexes were
identified which are formed
in the activation of the Chevron Phillips Chemical trimerization system
under conditions applied in industry. The obtained results show a
complicated pathway of activation in which multiple species are being
formed. The precursor, an ionic trinuclear Cr(III) carboxylate, is
initially reduced by the aluminum alkyl compounds to a polynuclear
Cr(II) carboxylate. Over time, a novel chloro-bridged dinuclear Cr(II)
pyrrolyl complex is formed.

In addition to the formation of
Cr(II) complexes, also the formation
of Cr(I) complexes is observed. In cyclohexane, only a small fraction
(<1%) is converted to an unknown Cr(I) species. In toluene, the
formation of bis(tolyl)chromium(I) species is observed; a much larger
fraction of the chromium content is found to be in the Cr(I) state
(∼23%). On the basis of the reduced performance of the catalyst
in toluene, it is suggested that formation of Cr(I) complexes deactivates
the catalyst.

No conclusions can be made regarding the actual
active species.
Catalytic tests allow to exclude the bis(tolyl)chromium(I) species
and polynuclear Cr(II) carboxylate. These tests however do not exclude
the dinuclear Cr(II) pyrrolyl complex, the Cr(I) complex observed
in cyclohexane or yet another unobservable complex. In addition, the
system might undergo further changes in the presence of ethene. Further
spectroscopic studies in the presence of ethene are required to draw
conclusions on the oxidation state of the active species.
