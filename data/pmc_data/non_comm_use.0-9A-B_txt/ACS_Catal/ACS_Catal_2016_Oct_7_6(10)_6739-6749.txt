The recent years
have witnessed the development of metal-catalyzed
reductive carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides with CO2 as C1 source, representing potential powerful alternatives to existing
methodologies for preparing carboxylic acids, privileged motifs in
a myriad of pharmaceuticals and molecules displaying significant biological
properties. While originally visualized as exotic cross-coupling reactions,
a close look into the literature data indicates that these processes
have become a fertile ground, allowing for the utilization of a variety
of coupling partners, even with particularly challenging substrate
combinations. As for other related cross-electrophile scenarios, the
vast majority of reductive carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides
are characterized by their simplicity, mild conditions, and a broad
functional group compatibility, suggesting that these processes could
be implemented in late-stage diversification. This perspective describes
the evolution of metal-catalyzed reductive carboxylation of organic
(pseudo)halides from its inception in the pioneering stoichiometric
work of Osakada to the present. Specific emphasis is devoted to the
reactivity of these coupling processes, with substrates ranging from
aryl-, vinyl-, benzyl- to unactivated alkyl (pseudo)halides. Despite
the impressive advances realized, a comprehensive study detailing
the mechanistic intricacies of these processes is still lacking. Some
recent empirical evidence reveal an intriguing dichotomy exerted by
the substitution pattern on the ligands utilized; still, however,
some elementary steps within the catalytic cycle of these reactions
remain speculative, in many instances invoking a canonical cross-coupling
process. Although tentative, we anticipate that these processes might
fall into more than one distinct mechanistic category depending on
the substrate utilized, suggesting that investigations aimed at unraveling
the mechanistic underpinnings of these processes will likely bring
new and innovative research grounds in this vibrant area of expertise.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the functionalization
of carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic matter has received
considerable attention.1 Such interest
arises from the fact that CO2 is the primary greenhouse
gas emitted through human activities
due to the industrial development of our society. Although CO2 fixation in synthetic endeavors will likely not reduce dramatically
its concentration in the atmosphere, the low cost, endless availability,
and benign character of CO2 hold promise to revolutionize
synthetic approaches for preparing high-value-added chemicals from
simple renewable feedstock, thus making a better use of energy and
carbon.2 Despite its thermodynamic stability
and kinetic inertness, a number of strategies have been designed for
promoting CO2 fixation, even at industrial scale.1−3 At present, the vast majority of synthetic applications for CO2 fixation into organic matter are predominantly based on C–O
bond-forming reactions or reduction events en route to methanol, formic
acid, or methane.4 Indeed, it is estimated
that approximately 110 megatons of CO2 are annually being
employed in the chemical industry for preparing urea, carbonates or
salicylic acid.2,5 In sharp contrast, however, the
ability to promote catalytic CO2 fixation
techniques via C–C bond-forming reactions
still remains a relatively unexplored terrain, particularly in industrial
settings, hence representing a formidable opportunity to increase
our ever-growing chemical arsenal for preparing compounds of utmost
synthetic relevance for both academic and pharmaceutical laboratories.

Carboxylic acids rank among the most ubiquitous motifs in a myriad
of compounds that display significant biological properties (Scheme 1).6 Actually, the presence of these frameworks and/or their
derivatives in pharmaceuticals is so pervasive that the inclusion
of the carboxylic acid function is often visualized as a requisite
in industrial venues. Although our synthetic portfolio includes a
wide variety of robust and reliable synthetic protocols for their
synthesis,7 there is ample consensus that
the importance of carboxylic acids and their prevalence in pharmaceuticals
requires the design of new catalytic carboxylation
methodologies with improved practicality, chemoselectivity, and generality.
To such end, chemists have been challenged to develop unconventional,
yet efficient, catalytic techniques that make use of simple, cheap,
and available raw materials for preparing synthetically valuable carboxylic
acids. Among the different alternatives, the means to utilize CO2, the simplest alternative feedstock, is particularly appealing.
Prompted by its low thermodynamic potential, it comes as no surprise
that initial efforts toward the implementation of carboxylation protocols
using CO2 were conducted using stoichiometric, highly reactive,
and in many instances, air-sensitive organometallic species such as
organolithium, Grignard reagents, or organozinc derivatives.8 Although formidable advances have been realized
with less-nucleophilic entities,9 the use
of well-defined organometallic reagents might reduce the applicability
of these methods, particularly when dealing with late-stage diversification
or densely functionalized backbones, thus reinforcing a change in
strategy.

Scheme 1 Biological Relevance of Carboxylic Acids
Taking into consideration that
stoichiometric organometallic species
are frequently prepared from organic halides, an ideal scenario within
the carboxylation arena would be the use of organic (pseudo)halides
as coupling partners, thus avoiding the need for well-defined and
stoichiometric organometallic reagents. By definition, the carboxylation
of organic (pseudo) halides falls into the category of catalytic cross-electrophile
coupling reactions.10 Unlike classical
cross-electrophile reactions based on homogeneous precursors, catalytic
carboxylation processes operate with CO2, a rather unreactive
electrophile that is not particularly soluble in regular organic solvents
employed in the cross-coupling arena, constituting a formidable challenge
from both a conceptual and technological standpoint. As evident from
the wealth of literature data reported in recent years, the metal-catalyzed
reductive carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides has reached remarkable
levels of sophistication, representing powerful alternatives for preparing
carboxylic acids from simple precursors. Interestingly, the vast majority
of these processes operate at atmospheric pressure of CO2, constituting an important bonus when compared with other CO2 fixation techniques.1 Outlined
below is a detailed overview over this emerging field of expertise,
which does not cover neither catalytic carboxylation protocols of
unsaturated compounds nor electrocatalytic processes, as these methods
have recently been reviewed elsewhere.11,12 Although significant
carboxylation techniques have been reported in the absence of a metal
catalyst,13 the purpose of this Perspective
is to summarize the most significant developments in catalytic reductive
carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides with CO2 as C1
source, including mechanistic discussions and future aspects, when
appropriate.

2 Direct Catalytic Carboxylation
of Organic Halides
with CO2
2.1 Catalytic Carboxylation
of Aryl Halides
In 1994, pioneering studies by Osakada and
Yamamoto showed that
well-defined Ph-Ni(L)Br (L = bpy) reacted with CO2 at atmospheric
pressure to afford benzoic acid in moderate yield.14 Although stoichiometric Ni species were required, this
study tacitly demonstrated the feasibility for promoting a CO2 insertion into the Ar–Ni bond, setting the stage for
designing catalytic carboxylation techniques. Surprisingly, this topic
remained dormant for some years, and it was only recently that these
processes could be implemented in a catalytic fashion. Specifically,
our group reported in 2009 a Pd-catalyzed carboxylation of aryl bromides
with CO2 (1–10 atm) using Et2Zn as reducing
agent (Scheme 2).15 The nature of the ligand turned out to be critical,
with particularly bulky and electron-rich tBuXPhos
providing the best results while minimizing parasitic dehalogenation
or Negishi-type reactions. Under these conditions, a wide number of
functional groups ranging from amines, ketones, (thio)ethers, or alkenes
to even epoxides could be tolerated. Although one might have anticipated
the involvement of arylzinc intermediates, control reactions employing
either PhZnBr or D2O quenching experiments suggested otherwise.
On the basis of these results, the proposed pathway was a CO2 insertion into the in situ-generated Ar–Pd(II)Br oxidative
addition complex followed by a final transmetalation with Et2Zn, thus forming a zinc benzoate while regenerating the catalytic
competent LnPd(0) species.

Scheme 2 Pd-Catalyzed
Carboxylation of Aryl Bromides
While the carboxylation of aryl bromides (Scheme 2) undoubtedly constituted a
proof-of-concept
for designing catalytic carboxylation techniques of organic halides,15 the need for pyrophoric reagents (i.e., Et2Zn), high pressures (1–10 atm), and the restriction
to aryl bromides constituted serious drawbacks to be overcome. To
this end, Tsuji and Fujihara described a Ni-catalyzed carboxylation
of aryl chlorides using simple Mn as reductant and ammonium salts
as additives (Scheme 3).16 Strikingly, the nature of the latter
had a profound influence on reactivity, with Et4NI being
particularly suited for effecting the carboxylation. In contrast with
our findings using aryl bromides,15 the
presence of bulky or electron-rich phosphines had a deleterious effect
on reactivity; indeed, PPh3 and bipyridine provided the
best results for aryl and vinyl chlorides, respectively. The authors
proposed a mechanism that is somewhat reminiscent of electrocatalytic
carboxylations in which an aryl–Ni(I) is generated upon single-electron
transfer (SET),17 likely facilitated by
Et4NI,18 a notion that was corroborated
by stoichiometric experiments with PhNiCl(PPh3)2 and Co(η5-C5H5)2 as well as theoretical calculations.19 A final CO2 insertion into the C(sp2)–Ni(I)
bond followed by SET mediated by Mn would regenerate the LnNi(0) species while forming the targeted carboxylic acid upon final
hydrolytic workup.

Scheme 3 Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Chlorides
In 2013, Daugulis described
a Cu/TMEDA regime for the catalytic
carboxylation of aryl iodides using Et2Zn as reducing agent
(Scheme 4).20,21 In line with our results dealing with aryl bromides,15 the presence of Et2Zn did not have
a deleterious effect, as a number of functional groups could be accommodated
perfectly. Even hindered substrate combinations could be within reach
at room temperature when using DMEDA as ligand, a significant finding
when compared to previous carboxylation techniques. The authors supported
a mechanistic scenario similar to that proposed in Scheme 2 with a CO2 insertion
occurring at the in situ-generated C(sp2)–Cu bond
followed by transmetalation with Et2Zn.

Scheme 4 Cu-Catalyzed Carboxylation
of Aryl Iodides
2.2 Catalytic
Carboxylation of Benzyl Halides
Although the synthesis of
benzoic acids highlighted in Schemes 2–4 led to the foundation
of modern catalytic carboxylation
reactions of organic halides, these catalytic endeavors should, by
no means, be limited to the coupling of aryl halides. Driven by the
prevalence of phenylacetic acids in molecules that display significant
biological activities such as vancomycin, carbenicillin, or ibuprofen,
among others,6 our group described a Ni-catalyzed
reductive carboxylation of primary, secondary, or even tertiary benzyl
halides with CO2 at atmospheric pressure and Zn dust as
reductant (Scheme 5).22 The role of additives was found to
be critical, with MgCl2 and TBAI providing the best results
when dealing with the coupling of primary or secondary/tertiary benzyl
halides, respectively. Under these conditions, a variety of functional
groups could be accommodated,
including alkenes, ketones, esters, or even aryl halides, thus leaving
ample room for orthogonal modifications. By definition, the direct
carboxylation of benzyl halides represent a synthetic alternative
to an otherwise related hydrocarboxylation of styrenes with CO2;23 unlike the latter, however,
the utilization of primary, secondary, or even tertiary benzyl halides
confers an improved flexibility in synthetic design. Preliminary stoichiomeric
studies with isolated η3-benzylnickel(II) species
in the absence and presence of external reductant allowed for establishing
a mechanistic rationale. Specifically, a pathway was proposed that
was somewhat reminiscent of the Cr-catalyzed Nozaki–Hiyama–Kishi
reaction,24 in which an initial oxidative
addition produces a η1/η3–benzylnickel(II) species that subsequently undergoes
SET mediated by Zn.17 The corresponding
benzylnickel(I) species might react with CO2,25 delivering a nickel(I) carboxylate that ultimately
generates the targeted phenylacetic acid upon SET followed by aqueous
workup while regenerating the active LnNi(0) catalyst. In 2014, a detailed theoretical study using DFT calculations
revealed the important role of MgCl2 for either stabilizing
a Ni(I)-CO2 complex prior to CO2 insertion,
or favoring SET-type processes.26

Scheme 5 Ni-Catalyzed
Carboxylation of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Benzyl
Halides
More recently, He
reported an alternate protocol for effecting
the reductive carboxylation of primary benzyl halides using Pd catalysts
and Mn as reducing agent (Scheme 6).27 In line with the corresponding
Pd-catalyzed carboxylation of aryl bromides,15 highly electron-donating and bulky phosphine ligands were found
to be critical for minimizing dimerization and dehalogenation pathways.
In this case, MgCl2 was proposed to act as Lewis acid for
facilitating CO2 insertion into the benzylic C(sp3)–Pd(II) bond, thus setting the stage for a final reduction
promoted by Mn, delivering a manganese carboxylate with concomitant
regeneration of LnPd(0).

Scheme 6 Pd-Catalyzed
Carboxylation of Primary Benzyl Chlorides
2.3 Catalytic Carboxylation of Unactivated Alkyl
Halides Possessing β-Hydrogens
In view of the available
literature data reported until late in 2013, it became apparent that
the catalytic reductive carboxylation arena seemed to be inherently
restricted to substrates that rapidly underwent oxidative addition
such as aryl or benzyl halides. Such observation suggested that the
extension to unactivated alkyl halides possessing β-hydrogens
would be a futile effort given their reluctance to undergo oxidative
addition and the proclivity of the in situ-generated alkyl metal species
toward destructive β-hydride elimination or homodimerization
pathways.28 Challenged by this perception,
our group initiated a program to unravel the potential of catalytic
carboxylation techniques of unactivated alkyl halides containing β-hydrogens.
Unlike previous carboxylation strategies of aryl or benzyl halides
based on phosphine ligands, the best results for the carboxylation
of unactivated alkyl bromides were achieved when utilizing Ni precatalysts
with bidentate nitrogen-containing ligands, particularly 1,10-phenanthroline
backbones (Scheme 7).29 Although certainly not anticipated,
it was found that the inclusion of ortho-substituents
adjacent to the nitrogen atom was critical for success. It was speculated
that an increased steric bulk around the nitrogen donor ligand could
result in greater stability of intermediate Ni(II) or the in situ-generated
Ni(I) complexes upon SET-processes. Under a Ni/L3 or
Ni/L4 regime, an excellent functional group compatibility
was observed, as nitriles, ketones, aldehydes, unprotected alcohols,
aryl halides, or even aryltin motifs, among others, could be perfectly
accommodated. These findings constituted a bonus when compared with
the classical carboxylation of air-sensitive, stoichiometric, and
rather reactive alkyl organometallic species with CO2.8 Importantly, the formation of a statistical mixture
of carboxylic acids from diastereomerically pure α,β-bisdeuterated
alkyl bromides supported the notion that SET-type processes might
be operative, pointing toward the involvement of Ni(I) intermediates.

Scheme 7 Ni-Catalyzed Direct Carboxylation of Unactivated Alkyl Bromides
In early 2016, the means to
promote catalytic reductive carboxylation
of secondary organic halides remained confined to substrates possessing
adjacent π-components such as aromatic rings,22 probably due to the stabilization of the putative reaction
intermediates. Recently, our group partially addressed this limitation
by designing a Ni-catalyzed reductive carboxylation of bromocyclopropane
derivatives (Scheme 8).30 The rationale behind the observed
reactivity was attributed to the ring strain and orbital rehybridization
of cyclopropyl rings,31 thus facilitating
the targeted carboxylation event. In line with the carboxylation of
unactivated alkyl bromides (Scheme 7),29 it was found that the
combination of ortho-substituted 1,10-phenanthrolines
such as L5 with LiCl provided the best results while
avoiding competitive ring-opened products. Interestingly, cis/trans ratios were invariably observed for unsymmetrically
substituted substrates, regardless of whether diastereomerically pure trans- or cis-cyclopropyl bromides were
utilized, thus suggesting the intermediacy of SET-processes via Ni(I)
reaction intermediates.17 It is worth noting,
however, that a single diastereoisomer was found when promoting an
otherwise similar carboxylation but employing cyclopropene derivatives,
thus showing that modifications on the substrate might lead to different
reaction mechanisms. Interestingly, stoichiometric studies with (L3)2Ni(0) species revealed that the reaction required
the utilization of Mn, thus reinforcing the notion that SET-type processes
intervene in these reactions.

Scheme 8 Ni-Catalyzed Reductive Carboxylation
of Cyclopropyl Bromides
Despite the advances realized, the direct carboxylation
of unactivated
secondary or tertiary organic halides still constituted a chimera;
additionally, no examples of unactivated alkyl chlorides were reported.
To such end, our group recently reported a catalytic carboxylation
of unactivated primary, secondary, and even tertiary alkyl chlorides
that occurred with an exquisite chemoselectivity profile at atmospheric
pressure of CO2 (Scheme 9).32 Notably, this protocol
demonstrated that intermolecular cross-electrophile
coupling of unactivated alkyl chlorides could be within reach, thus
exploiting a previously unrecognized opportunity in this field.10 As for previous catalytic carboxylation techniques,29,31 the presence of ortho-substituents on the phenanthroline
backbone and the role of additives were found to be critical, with
a combination of L6/L7 and nBu4NBr (TBAB) showing the best results.18

Scheme 9 Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation of Unactivated Primary,
Secondary, or
Tertiary Alkyl Chlorides
Although one might argue that a Br/Cl exchange could occur
in the
presence of TBAB, control experiments revealed otherwise; indeed,
similar reactivity was found when using LiCl instead of TBAB. As for
the carboxylation of unactivated primary alkyl bromides,29 stereochemical studies by isotope-labeling suggested
the involvement of radical intermediates via SET-type processes. As
expected, both (L6)2Ni(0) and (L6)2Ni(I) (OTf) were found to be competent as reaction intermediates
when using 1-(4-chlorobutyl)-4-methoxybenzene as substrate, and high
yields of the corresponding carboxylic acid were obtained regardless
of whether these complexes were used in a catalytic or stoichiometric
fashion. Importantly, it was found that the carboxylation occurred
even in the absence of TBAB, thus reinforcing the
notion that a Cl/Br exchange is not required. These results suggested
that the reaction is initiated by the formation of discrete alkyl-Ni(II)Cl
species generated upon a nonclassical oxidative addition based on
a SET followed by recombination with the corresponding Ni(I)Cl.

The success of this reaction suggested that this technique could
be adapted in iterative cross-coupling scenarios of polyhalogenated
backbones.33 As shown in Scheme 10, this turned out to be the
case. Specifically, it was found that a cross-electrophile protocol
reported by Gong34 with tert-butyl bromide resulted in the exclusive formation of the targeted
product bearing an all-carbon quaternary center in 65% yield. Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction based on the employment of one-component Pd(II)-precatalysts
popularized by Buchwald35 with PhB(OH)2 took place exclusively at the aryl chloride motif. A final
exposure under a Ni/L6 regime easily promoted the carboxylation
of the unactivated alkyl chloride residue, affording the targeted
alkyl carboxylic acid in 60% yield.

Scheme 10 Iterative Cross-Coupling
Reactions of Polyhalogenated Backbones
At first sight, the involvement of SET-processes in catalytic
carboxylation
of unactivated alkyl halides might be visualized as an important drawback
to be overcome, as enantioenriched precursors ultimately ended up
in racemic materials. However, such observation could be turned into
a strategic advantage for promoting cascade carboxylation reactions
initiated by SET-type processes, thus setting the basis for biomimetic
carboxylation events. Specifically, our research group found that
alkyl halides possessing alkyne motifs at an appropriate position
within an alkyl side-chain could trigger a tandem cyclization/carboxylation
reaction en route to five- or even six-membered rings, thus giving
access to rather elusive tetrasubstituted carboxylated olefins in
which CO2 insertion takes place at a distal reaction site
(Scheme 11).32,36 The optimization of the reaction conditions evidenced a delicate
interplay between all the reaction components; although a cocktail
based on L3 or L8 was suitable for alkyl
bromides,36L7 and L9 showed to be superior for alkyl chlorides.32 More importantly, this technology was distinguished by an intriguing
divergence in syn/anti-selectivity that could be
easily dictated by the ligand or substrate utilized when operating
with secondary alkyl halides. Isotope-labeling studies and stoichiometric
experiments with L2Ni(0) species suggested that while primary
alkyl halides follow a classical oxidative addition pathway, the origin
of the anti-selective motion found in secondary alkyl
halides might be interpreted via SET-type processes. The rationale
behind such observation is tentatively ascribed to the intermediacy
of two vinyl radicals with sp2-character that can rapidly
interconvert prior recombination with the corresponding LNi(I)X species.
The observed anti-motion can be attributed to a preferential
recombination of the vinyl radical with the Ni center by avoiding
the clash with the substituents originally located at the alkyl halide
terminus. Indirect evidence for such a pathway was obtained when observing
a single carboxylic acid with an anti-motion upon
exposure of iodo(2-methoxycyclopentylidene)methylbenzene (E:Z = 2:1) under the optimized reaction conditions (Scheme 11, bottom).

Scheme 11 Ni-Catalyzed Cyclization/Carboxylation of Unactivated Alkyl Halides
It is evident that the catalytic
reductive carboxylation of organic
halides has reached remarkable levels of sophistication, allowing
for the coupling of aryl,15,16,20 benzyl,22,27 or even the always-challenging unactivated
alkyl halides possessing β-hydrogens,29,32,36 thus demonstrating the versatility, potential,
and the application profile of these methodologies.13 At first sight, one might argue that this field of expertise
has reached its full potential; however, the lack of enantioselective
or stereospecific reductive carboxylation reactions of organic halides
to prepare enantioenriched carboxylic acids indicates otherwise. Taking
into consideration the recent developments in catalytic enantioselective
transformations, it is inevitable to predict a bright future within
the area of catalytic asymmetric carboxylation.

3 Direct Catalytic Carboxylation of C–Heteroatom
Bonds with CO2
3.1 Catalytic Carboxylation
of Organic Sulfonates
via C–O Cleavage
The success of cross-coupling reactions
of organic halides contributed to the perception that these reactions
could only be executed efficiently if an organic halide is utilized
as coupling partner.37 However, the toxicity
associated with the halogenated waste and the difficulties for accessing
organic halides in advanced synthetic intermediates still constituted
serious drawbacks to be overcome. Not surprisingly, the search for
alternative coupling partners has recently been taken up with considerable
rigor. Among these, C–O electrophiles have recently emerged
as powerful alternatives to organic halides in cross-coupling reactions
due to their low toxicity, ready availability, and natural abundance
of alcohols.38 The first example of a catalytic
CO2 insertion into C–O bonds was reported by Tsuji
and Fujihara using aryl tosylates and triflates under similar conditions
to those employed for the carboxylation of aryl chlorides with a regime
based on NiCl2(PPh3)2 and Et4NI as additive (Scheme 3).16 Recently, Durandetti extended
the scope of these reactions by using NiBr2(bpy) as precatalyst
in the absence of halogenated additives (Scheme 12).39 Although
moderate yields were obtained under these reaction conditions, a wide
variety of electron-rich or electron-poor aryl tosylates could be
employed, including ortho-substituted precursors.

Scheme 12 Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl Tosylates
While Tsuji and Fujihara demonstrated the ability of Ni
catalysts
to efficiently promote the carboxylation of aryl and vinyl chlorides
(Scheme 3),16 the carboxylation of particularly hindered substrate
combinations was still rather problematic. Taking these observations
into consideration, in 2015 Tsuji and Fujihara described the catalytic
carboxylation of alkenyl as well as sterically encumbered aryl triflates
utilizing either Co(II) or Ni(II) precatalysts (Scheme 13).40 Although the Co-catalyzed carboxylation of alkenyl triflates displayed
an excellent chemoselectivity profile, the method remained unfortunately
restricted to trisubstituted alkenyl triflates. Still, however, it
was found that either CoI2(L3) or NiI2(PPh3)2 performed perfectly well for
aryl triflates, even for particularly hindered substrate combinations.
These results go in line with previous observations made by our group
in which the presence of substituents adjacent to the nitrogen atom
in 1,10-phenanthroline-type ligands ultimately result in Ni intermediates
with superior reactivity and stability.29,32,36

Scheme 13 Co- and Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation of Aryl and Alkenyl
Triflates
As part of our study
on the Ni-catalyzed carboxylation of unactivated
alkyl bromides possessing β-hydrogens (Scheme 7),29 our group
found that a catalytic couple based on L3 and Mn as reducing
agent was particularly suited for the carboxylation of unactivated
primary alkyl mesylates or tosylates (Scheme 14).29 The reaction
mechanism was believed to follow an otherwise identical rationale
to that proposed for primary alkyl bromides based on SET-type processes.
In line with this notion, isotope-labeling studies revealed the loss
of chemical integrity at C1 when promoting the reaction with diastereomerically
pure alkyl tosylates possessing deuterium labels at C1 and C2.

Scheme 14 Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation of Unactivated Alkyl Sulfonates
3.2 Catalytic
Carboxylation of Ester Derivatives
via C–O Cleavage
Unlike the utilization of particularly
activated organic sulfonates, a limited number of cross-coupling methodologies
have been conducted with simpler aryl esters due to the higher energy
required for effecting C(sp2)–O cleavage, the propensity
for hydrolysis via C(acyl)–O bond, and site-selectivity issues
in the presence of multiple C–O bonds.38 To this end, our group described the carboxylation of either aryl
or benzyl ester derivatives (Scheme 15).41 As expected, the ligand
played a crucial role, with dppf providing the best results when using
aryl pivalates as substrates. The superior reactivity of bulky ester
derivatives was tentatively attributed to a higher stabilization of
the putative reaction intermediates. The extension to benzyl esters
was not particularly problematic and either bulky pivalates or regular
acetate derivatives could be employed with equal ease with PMe3 as ligand. Unfortunately, the reaction of both aryl and benzyl
esters remained restricted to extended π-systems, a recurrent
limitation encountered in a myriad of C–O bond-cleavage scenarios.42 This limitation could partially be tackled by
the use of hemilabile directing groups on the ester motif,43 thus accelerating the rate of oxidative addition
while opening up coordination sites on the Ni center, ultimately facilitating
the corresponding CO2 insertion into the targeted C–O
bond. According to previous studies on Ni-catalyzed reductive carboxylations,
a catalytic cycle involving SET-processes mediated by Mn to generate
Ni(I) species prior CO2 insertion into the C–Ni
bond was proposed.17,25

Scheme 15 Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation
of Aryl and Benzyl Ester Derivatives
In 2014, Tsuji and Fujihara explored the viability of
promoting
the catalytic carboxylation of propargyl acetates (Scheme 16).44 Interestingly, it was found that a catalytic reaction based on CoI2 was not particularly ligand-dependent; still, however, the
best results were accomplished with 1,10-phenanthroline as ligand.
While one might expect the participation of allenyl metal intermediates
resulting in both propargylic and/or allenyl carboxylic acids, exclusive
formation of the former was observed in all cases analyzed.13 Unfortunately, the reaction was predominantly
conducted with secondary or tertiary propargyl acetates and the presence
of bulky groups on the alkyne terminus. Although a mechanism consisting
of oxidative addition of the propargyl ester to Co(I) was proposed,
the participation of allenyl cobalt intermediates cannot be ruled
out.

Scheme 16 Co-Catalyzed Reductive Carboxylation of Propargyl Acetates
Catalyst-controlled selectivity
in which a common precursor is
transformed into two or more different products has recently been
the subject of intensive investigations.45 In late 2014, however, regiodivergent reactions remained restricted
to nucleophile/electrophile regimes. To this end, our group questioned
whether a regiodivergent reductive carboxylation technique could be
implemented by using allyl acetates as substrates, arguing that the
ligand backbone could discriminate both ends of the initially formed
π-allyl metal complex. This hypothesis turned out to be correct,
resulting in a modular technique capable of introducing selectively
the carboxylic acid function at either site of the allyl terminus
(Scheme 17).46 Importantly, the reaction was not substrate-controlled,
as the ligand backbone exclusively dictated the selectivity pattern
regardless of whether linear or α-branched allyl acetates were
utilized. Specifically, a protocol based on L3 resulted
in linear carboxylic acids, whereas a selectivity switch was observed
when operating with L10, obtaining α-branched carboxylic
acids. Although the selectivity profile exclusively depended on the
ligand utilized, it was found that the role of additives and reducing
agent exerted a non-negligible influence on reactivity, with a protocol
based on Mn/MgCl2 or Zn/Na2CO3 providing
the best results for linear and α-branched carboxylic acids,
respectively. Notably, it was possible to isolate the putative Ni(0)(L3)2 and Ni(0)(L10) species and study
their reactivity with CO2. Unlike the classical tetrahedral
environment found for d10 complexes in Ni(0)(L3)2, it came as surprise that a square-planar geometry
was observed for Ni(0)(L10), an observation that probably
indicates that the latter should be better described as a Ni(II)(L10) complex with a reduced quaterpyridine dianion. Interestingly,
while the reducing agent was required when using Ni(0)(L3)2 in a stoichiometric manner, its absence was inconsequential
for reactions based on Ni(0)(L10). The intermediacy of
an allyl-Ni(I)(L3) species might account for these results,
whereas the observed reactivity for Ni(0)(L10) suggests
that CO2 insertion does not take place neither at the C–Ni
center nor via allyl-Ni(I) intermediates, but rather at the γ-position.
This observation is somewhat reminiscent of the Pd-carboxylation of
allenes mediated by multidentate ligands reported by both Iwasawa
and Hazari.47

Scheme 17 Ni-Catalyzed Regiodivergent
Carboxylation of Allyl Acetates
3.3 Catalytic Carboxylation of Allylic Alcohols
Recently, the group of Mita and Sato described the Pd-catalyzed
carboxylation of allylic alcohols via formal activation of C–OH
bonds using Et2Zn as reducing agent (Scheme 18).48 In all cases analyzed, α-branched carboxylic acids were exclusively
obtained regardless of whether linear or α-branched allyl alcohols
were utilized. The authors demonstrated the utility of this protocol
by promoting a one-pot carboxylation using simple aldehydes as starting
precursors. The observed reactivity was attributed to the coordination
of the alcohol motif to the Lewis-acidic Zn(II) center, substantially
increasing the leaving group capabilities of the alcohol motif. Although
the products can be obtained in excellent yields without the need
for derivatizing the corresponding allylic alcohols, the method required
the utilization of well-defined and air-sensitive organometallic reagents.

3.4 Catalytic Carboxylation of Benzylic Ammonium
Salts
Despite the considerable progress in ligand design
in the carboxylation arena, the reductive carboxylation of benzylic
systems is not as commonly practiced as one might anticipate. Indeed,
the available carboxylation portfolio of benzyl electrophiles invariably
results in considerable amounts of homodimerization and β-hydride
elimination.22,27 Additionally, these methods are
restricted by a rather limited set of substitution patterns. For example,
the preparation of phenyl acetic acids possessing α-alkyl residues
other than methyl groups still remained elusive. Prompted by these
observations, our group recently designed a catalytic carboxylation
of air-, thermally stable and highly crystalline ammonium salts via
C(sp3)–N cleavage (Scheme 19).49 Specifically,
it was found that a Ni/L6 or Ni/L7 couple
outperforms previous carboxylation of benzyl electrophiles,22,27 resulting in high yields of phenyl acetic acids while avoiding homodimerization
and β-hydride elimination. The extension to secondary benzyl
ammonium salts possessing β-alkyl chains other than methyl groups
and without the requisite for π-extended systems is particularly
appealing, giving access to carboxylic acids that would be beyond
reach using other carboxylation techniques.

Scheme 19 Ni-Catalyzed Carboxylation
of Benzylic Ammonium Salts
As for other carboxylation processes based on 2,2′-substituted
phenanthroline ligands,29,32,36,46 it was possible to isolate and
characterize by X-ray crystallography the corresponding Ni(0)(L6)2 complex or even the Ni(I)(L6)OTf
species. As expected, these complexes were found to be catalytically
competent as reaction intermediates. Interestingly, a considerable
erosion in yield was found when exposing stoichiometric amounts of
Ni(0)(L6)2 to a model substrate under CO2 atmosphere in the absence of Mn. Although speculative, a
mechanistic scenario based on the intermediacy of SET-processes or
comproportionation events via the in situ generation of benzyl Ni(I)
intermediates was proposed.50

In
light of the results shown above, it is evident that the utilization
of electrophiles other than organic halides has shown to be a viable,
yet powerful, alternative to commonly practiced catalytic reductive
carboxylation reactions. Still, this field has not reached its full
potential, as the utilization of unactivated alcohols or alkyl ethers,
elusive counterparts in the cross-coupling arena, still remains unexplored.
Additionally, the only successful protocol based on C–N cleavage
employs benzyl ammonium salts; certainly, the ability to include unactivated
amines, amides or sulfonamides would be highly appreciated, providing
new vistas in this area of expertise.

4 Summary
and Outlook
Prompted by the kinetic inertness and the thermodynamic
stability
of CO2, the means to promote carboxylation reactions was
originally thought to be limited to the utilization of stoichiometric,
well-defined, and highly reactive organometallic reagents. Seminal
studies reported by Osakada in 1994 using stoichiometric amounts of transition metal complexes demonstrated that benzoic
acids could be within reach from the corresponding aryl halide via
CO2 insertion into in situ-generated C(sp2)–Ni
bonds. Intriguingly, this important finding remained dormant for some
years, and it was not until 2009 that our group demonstrated that
a catalytic reductive carboxylation of aryl halides
could be within reach if selecting appropriately the supporting ligand
and reducing agent. As judged by the wealth of literature data reported
in recent years, it is evident that Osakada’s discovery, although
devoid of any practical application, set the basis for modern catalytic
carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides. The significant growth experienced
in this arena has recently allowed to substantially expand the scope
of electrophilic partners that can participate in carboxylation processes,
including the always-elusive unactivated alkyl halides possessing
β-hydrogens. Although one might argue that this field has reached
its full potential, this cannot be further from the truth. Indeed,
unactivated alkyl alcohols, amines, or ethers, arguably attractive
counterparts due to their lower cost, lack of toxicity and wider availability,
have yet not been employed in this arena. A remaining issue in these
endeavors is the use of superstoichiometric amounts of reducing agents.
In this regard, more environmentally benign reducing agents or the
implementation of photocatalytic techniques would be, conceptually
and practicality aside, a considerable step forward. Additionally,
the current carboxylation portfolio is unfortunately plagued by the
employment of high catalyst loadings, an argument that might hinder
the implementation of these techniques at industrial settings. Obviously,
the means to promote a catalytic C–H carboxylation while avoiding
prefunctionalization at the initial reaction site would be an ideal
alternative; although some progress has been described in this regard,
at present these methodologies remain essentially confined to relatively
acidic C–H bonds51 and the utilization
of directing-group methodologies.52 Additionally,
the means to promote enantioselective catalytic reductive carboxylation
of organic matter is virtually absent in the literature. Taken together,
these observations suggest that there is ample room for implementing
greener and more practical catalytic carboxylation reactions.

Despite the recent advances realized, our knowledge on the reaction
mechanisms is still in its infancy. Unfortunately, the mechanistic
underpinnings of catalytic carboxylation reactions of organic (pseudo)halides
remain largely speculative, particularly in Ni-catalyzed processes.
This is largely due to the formation of short-lived entities, the
presence of low-coordinate species, the exceptional air-sensitivity
of the putative reaction intermediates, and the rather enigmatic role
of the additives utilized in these endeavors. Although some important
empirical observations have been made with the isolation of well-defined
Ni(0)Ln species, as well as the discovery
that seemingly trivial modifications in the ligand environment dramatically
change the reaction outcome, a reliable access to the key reaction
intermediates within the catalytic cycle still remains, at present,
a chimera. Additionally, preliminary experimental evidence suggest
that the catalytic carboxylation of electrophilic partners might fall
into more than one distinct mechanistic category, with paramagnetic
intermediates likely coming into play. Beyond any reasonable doubt,
an in depth study of the kinetic profile of these reactions would
certainly shed light onto the reaction mechanism; unfortunately, however,
the heterogeneous nature of these processes, with reagents in either
gas, liquid, or solid phase makes this task particularly problematic.
In view of the serious existing barriers for studying reaction mechanisms
in carboxylation processes, one might argue that unraveling the intricacies
of these reactions might be a futile effort. We are absolutely confident,
however, that efforts toward this goal are of vital importance and
that fundamental knowledge will likely arise from understanding how
these reactions operate at a molecular level, thus setting the basis
for the discovery of conceptually new processes that will definitely
drive research in this arena in the years to come.
