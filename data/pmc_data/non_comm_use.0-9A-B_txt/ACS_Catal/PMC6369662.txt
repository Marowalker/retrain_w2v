The
Diels–Alder cycloaddition (DAC) is a powerful tool to
construct C–C bonds. The DAC reaction can be accelerated in
several ways, one of which is reactant confinement as observed in
supramolecular complexes and Diels–Alderases. Another method
is altering the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the reactants
by using homogeneous transition-metal complexes whose active sites
exhibit d-orbitals suitable for net-bonding orbital interactions with
the substrates. Both features can be combined in first row d-block
(TM) exchanged faujasite catalysts where the zeolite framework acts
as a stabilizing ligand for the active site while confining the reactants.
Herein, we report on a mechanistic and periodic DFT study on TM-(Cu(I),
Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Cr(III), Sc(III), V(V))exchanged faujasites
to elucidate the effect of d-shell filling on the DAC reaction between
2,5-dimethylfuran and ethylene. Two pathways were found: one being
the concerted one-step and the other being the stepwise two-step pathway.
A decrease in d-shell filling results in a concomitant increase in
reactant activation as evidenced by increasingly narrow energy gaps
and lower activation barriers. For models holding relatively small
d-block cations, the zeolite framework was found to bias the DAC reaction
toward an asynchronous one-step pathway instead of the two-step pathway.
This work is an example of how the active site properties and the
surrounding chemical environment influence the reaction mechanism
of chemical transformations.

1 Introduction
The Diels–Alder
cycloaddition (DAC)1 is a powerful reaction
to construct new C–C bonds in the
synthesis of compounds like drugs, macromolecules, and self-healing
materials.2−8 The reaction takes place between a 1,3-diene and a moiety containing
a double or triple bond (dienophile) and results in a cyclic product
(Figure 1a). Depending
on geometrical constraints and the symmetry of the orbitals that are
involved, the reaction proceeds either via a one- or two-step reaction
pathway to form, respectively, the two C–C bonds simultaneously
or via a stepwise mechanism.9−11

Figure 1 Generalized schemes for (a) the DAC and
(b) DAC/D reaction. These
reactions can be promoted by faujasite zeolite catalysts represented
in this study by (c) a high-silica TM cation exchanged faujasite model
(purple = first row d-block cation, yellow = zeolite framework with
omitted oxygen atoms). The catalyst activates the substrates through
(d) FMO−TM-orbital interactions.

The activation energy (Eact)
of this
reaction is known to correlate with the energy and symmetry of the
frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the reactants.12−14 The reaction can proceed via the normal electron demand mechanism
with a normal energy gap (enorm) defined
by the difference between the HOMOdiene and LUMOdienophile. Alternatively, the reaction can follow the inverse electron demand
mechanism involving the inverse energy gap (einv) determined by the LUMOdiene and HOMOdienophile. A third mechanism is the neutral electron demand mechanism in which enorm = einv. Ancillary
species can be used to alter the FMO energies and the associated HOMO–LUMO
gap through orbital interactions, thereby affecting the DAC activation
energy.15,16

It has recently been established that
DAC chemistry is also useful
for the conversion of furanic compounds to aromatics.5,17,18 The DAC reaction yields oxygen-containing
bicyclic intermediates which is followed by dehydration yielding the
aromatic compounds.19 Because furanics
can be readily obtained from biomass-based feedstock,20,21 they can serve as intermediates in the production of biobased aromatics.22 Such a Diels–Alder Cycloaddition (DAC)/Dehydration(D)
reaction (Figure 1b)
process is regarded an appealing sustainable alternative to the existing
petrochemical production routes.23,24

Lewis25−36 and Brønsted acid37−41 zeolite catalysts have been reported to be active for the DAC/D
of biomass-derived furanic compounds. The perspective process targets
such products as benzene,26,37 toluene,29,42 para-xylene25,27,37 as well as oxygenated aromatics compounds.26,36,41,43,44 The Lewis acidic zeolites such as alkali-exchanged
faujasites25−27,29,45 and lattice-modified Sn-, Ti-, Zr-and Zn-silicate zeolites32,34,36,43,44,46 have been
reported to be highly selective catalysts for these processes.

Previously, we explored the use of low-silica alkali-exchanged
faujasite zeolites (Si/Al = 2.4; M = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+; denoted MY) holding
a high active site density in the DAC/D reaction of DMF with ethylene.25,26,45 Among the evaluated catalysts,
one of the weakest Lewis acid zeolite catalysts (RbY) exhibited the
lowest DAC-activation barrier.25,45 The catalytic effect,
however, involved confinement rather than electronic modifications
common for LA catalysis.45 Indeed, in MY
catalysts, no alkali s-orbital···substrate-FMO overlap
was found which could activate the reactants.26 Such an overlap can be established when d-elements are considered
as active sites. Therefore, in this computational study, we focused
on the effect of first row d-block (TM) cations stabilized in faujasite
(FAU) micropores on the DAC reaction between DMF and C2H4 (Figure 1c). Because of the symmetry of both DMF and ethylene FMOs, σ-donor/acceptor
and π-donor/acceptor interactions can be established with the
TM cation d-orbitals upon coordination. Thus, the TM cations act both
as Lewis acids and Lewis bases. That is, while exhibiting orbital
overlap with the TM active site, the ethylene and DMF HOMOs act as
σ-donor and π-donor while the ethylene and DMF LUMOs act
as π-acceptor and σ-acceptor, respectively. Figure 1d schematically illustrates
the representative orbital interactions for ethylene, while the DFT-computed
frontier orbitals for both substrates are shown in Figure S1.

TM-based catalysts are widely employed in
DAC chemistry. Systems
such as the TM coordination complexes,47−55 TM-exchanged clays,52 and TM-exchanged
zeolites51 have been used earlier to catalyze
DAC reactions. Among others,50,54,56 catalytic systems based on Cu(I),54,56 Cu(II),56,57 Ni(II),47,56 Zn(II),47,56 Sc(III),47,51,55 and Cr(III)52,53,56 have been investigated. Typically, the reaction
starts with a η2/η4-type coordination
of the dienophile/diene to the metal ion.48,49,54,56,58,59 The subsequent DAC
mechanism usually involves an oxidative cyclization step that leads
to a metallacycle intermediate followed by reductive elimination yielding
the DAC adduct.

Combining TM cations as extra-framework active
sites with zeolites
results in the formation of microporous catalysts that can be seen
as rigid enzymes or siliceous supramolecular complexes. Diels–Alderases60−63 and supramolecular complexes64−66 show good performance in terms
of activity via the confinement effect. Diels–Alderases bias
a specific reaction channel by stabilizing the transition state (TS)
in the protein matrix to achieve a high product stereoselectivity.
Supramolecular catalysts also make use of noncovalent interactions
to push the DAC reaction to proceed via a specific low-energy pathway
showing an appropriate molecular fit with the molecular-sized cavity
of the host. In comparison, the easy-to-prepare and relatively cheap
zeolite-based catalysts are well-known for their ability to exert
shape selectivity on chemical transformations within the confined
microporous space while holding catalytically actives sites.67 Clearly, this is reminiscent of the shape selectivity
induced by the catalytically active pocket in Diels–Alderases,
or as enforced by a supramolecular environment.

It is therefore
attractive to investigate the DAC reaction mechanism
of DMF with ethylene and the electronic and steric factors governing
the reactivity in TM-modified zeolite catalysts. In particular, we
are interested in cations such as Cu(I), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Sc(III)
and Cr(III) (d10, d9, d8, d10, d0 and d3, respectively) because of their
known DAC activity and the varying d-electron configuration. Besides
these practical systems, it is also interesting to consider a hypothetical
model containing the pentavalent V(V) cation. Monomeric V(V) can typically
be found to reside in zeolites as a terminal oxo species.68 However, in this work, we omitted the oxygen
atom to solely focus on the effect of the strong Lewis acid/base properties
of the V(V) cation.

2 Computational Details
Models
We studied the DAC reaction between DMF and
ethylene over a periodic rhombohedral faujasite model containing an
extraframework transition metal (TM) cation (TM = Cu(I), Cu(II), Zn(II),
Ni(II), Cr(III), Sc(III), and V(V); e.g., Ni(II)FAU). The cations
were located in the 6-membered ring of the sodalite cage, facing the
supercage. This site is commonly referred to as the SII site.69 To ensure the overall charge neutrality of the
model, an appropriate amount of Al3+ substitutions was
placed as symmetrically as possible around the TM cation.

Methods
All calculations were carried out in the framework
of density functional theory (DFT) with the gradient corrected PBE
exchange-correlation functional and the projected-augmented-wave scheme
(PAW) to describe the electron–ion interactions.70−74 Calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation
Package (VASP). The DFT-D3 method with Becke-Johnson damping was used
to account for long-range dispersive interactions.75,76 The k-point mesh was limited to the gamma-point. The plane-wave
basis set cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. Cell-optimization was performed
with a cutoff energy of 650 eV. Typically, a root-mean-square (RMS)
force convergence criterion of 0.015 eV/Å was employed. Models
which contained TM cations with open d-shells were subjected to spin
polarized calculations by enforcing the electron configurations using
the appropriate settings in VASP. Different spin states of these TMFAU
models were screened to find the energetically preferred electronic
configurations. These were found to correspond to one, two, and three
unpaired electrons for Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cr(III), respectively.

The transition states were located via a two-step procedure. First,
a Climbing Nudged-Elastic-Band (CNEB) calculation77,78 was performed to estimate the minimum energy pathway (MEP) (5 eV/Å2 spring constant, maximum length hyper-vector between images
0.5 Å). For reactions proceeding via a two-step pathway, extra
images were iteratively inserted to yield a MEP with finely distributed
images. The accepted RMS force of the converged CNEB was 0.14 eV/Å
or lower. Consecutively, geometry optimization of the identified transition
states and possible intermediate was continued using the quasi-Newton
procedure (maximal RMS 0.015 eV/Å). Vibrational frequencies were
computed with the finite displacement method to confirm the nature
of the stationary points.

Atomic Net Charges
The atomic net
charges were computed
in the framework of the QTAIM theory79 using
VASP and the freely available scripts developed by Henkelman and co-workers80−83 (Bader charges). To obtain accurate Bader charges, the VASP-calculations
were performed using a 2.5 times increased FFT-grid density. Charge
integration was done in accordance with the method proposed by Yu
and Trinkle83 with a vacuum level cutoff
of 10–4 e–/Å3.
Tests with increasing grid density show that the convergence of the
atomic charge was obtained at the employed values (accuracy of 0.01
e–). The net charges per atom were obtained by referencing
the calculated charges to the ideal valence charge of every atom.
The Bader charges were compared with those obtained by employing the
Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical (DDEC6) method and were
found to be similar. Therefore, in the text we report the Bader charges
only whenever atomic or molecular net charges are discussed.

Bond Orders
(BO) were analyzed using the Chargemol
code.84 We refer to the literature for
extensive derivation of the equations necessary to compute the bond
orders and carry out the underlying DDEC6 charge partitioning.85−87 Briefly, the bond order of an atom pair A (in the
unit cell) and j (atoms in both unit cell and periodic
images) is 1  where BA,j is the bond
order between atom A and j, CEA,j is the contact exchange
and ΛA,j is the dressed exchange
hole delocalization term. The term CEA,j describes the electron exchange between atoms A and j in a material: 2  where any iavg is the average spherical electron
density of atom i as a function of the atomic electron
distribution and atomic spin magnetization density vector obtained
through DDEC6-based partitioning of the electron density. The term avg is the sum
of all iavg found in the material (unit cell +
periodic images). Note that this equation deals with the dressed exchange
hole, which is an adjusted (either more contracted or more diffuse)
exchange hole to obtain more accurate bond orders. The second term
in eq 1. is the dressed
exchange hole delocalization term defined according to eq 3: 3  where XA,jcoord.nr. accounts
for coordination number effects, XA,jpairwise for
pairwise interactions and XA,jcon. is a constraint
on the density-derived localization index, BA,A. The latter is a matrix that equals the
total number of the dressed exchange electrons in the material (unit
cell + periodic images). These terms are constraints and scaling relationships
to keep the bond orders well-behaved.

Density-of-States Analysis
The (partial) density of
states (pDOS), the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population and Crystal
Orbital Overlap Population analysis were computed with the Lobster
code,88−92 via transformation of the (plane) wave functions obtained by VASP
into a localized basis set (STO). The evaluation of the (p)DOS in
this way allows one to account for an analysis within the entire Brillouin
zone and encompassing the entire electron density (i.e., summation
of the local DOS adds up correctly to the value of the total DOS).
In addition, for a consistent chemical interpretation of the pDOS
independent of the atom position or orientation in the unit cell,
an automatic rotation of the basis set was applied. The DOS values
reported in this work are obtained by summation of both the up and
down spin components.

Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population Analysis
The Crystal
Orbital Hamiltonian Population (COHP) is related to the pDOS and allows
partitioning of the electron density distribution into bonding, nonbonding,
and antibonding interaction domains.88−92 The −COHPij(E) is defined in eq 4 as 4  where Hij represents the Hamiltonian matrix element between
atomic orbitals
φi and φj, and ci and cj are the coefficients of these
atomic orbitals in the molecular orbital ψn (ψn = ∑icinφi). A positive value for −COHPij(E) symbolizes a bonding electronic
interaction between the atomic orbitals i and j, while a negative value describes an antibonding interaction.
A value of zero is associated with a nonbonding interaction. The integrated
value of −COHPij(E), ICOHP, can be considered to be a measure for the bond strength.
This formulation provides a good approximation of the bond energy
as long as the repulsive energy of the nuclei is canceled by the double-counted
electrostatic interactions.93

Crystal Orbital
Overlap Population Analysis
The Crystal
Orbital Overlap Population (COOPij(E)) function introduced by Hoffmann94 can be defined according to eq 5: 5  where Sij = ⟨φi|φj⟩ is the overlap
of atomic orbitals
φi and φj. The values of COOPij(E) also quantify the bonding or antibonding character of
the orbital interactions, but the electron density is now weighted
by the atomic orbital overlap Sij instead of the bond energy overlap Hij. As a consequence, COOPij(E) cannot quantitatively analyze the contribution of the
bonds to the total energy like the −COHPij(E) does. A quantitative evaluation of the
bond strengths can nevertheless be obtained from the values of the
integrated COOP (in unit of electrons).

3 Results
The DAC reaction is initiated by coadsorption of the reactants
resulting in the adsorbed state 1 (DMF + C2H4 + TMFAU → 1/TMFAU). One reactant
adsorbs on the TM cation, and the other interacts via van der Waals
interactions with the zeolite matrix. When DMF is η2-coordinated to the TM cation and ethylene interacts with the framework,
we refer to it as a DMF-based reaction with DMF as the primary adsorbent
(1DMF). Conversely, we refer to an ethylene-based
reaction when the η2-coordinated ethylene is the
primary adsorbent (1C2).

The DAC reaction
can proceed via two pathways. The first is a single-step
(a)synchronous concerted DAC reaction with two nascent C···C
bonds in the transition state (TS) yielding the bicyclic
1,4-dimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (2). The second
pathway is a two-step reaction. This pathway starts from 1, reaches intermediate I via the first transition state TS1, and eventually results in 2 via the second
transition state TS2. In TS1, the first
C···C bond develops and in TS2 the second
one. Figure 2 shows
the DMF-based synchronous concerted one-step (a–c) and two-step
(d–h) pathways over Cu(I)FAU and Cu(II)FAU, respectively. A
two-step mechanism with η1-coordinated DMF in TS1 and no I and TS2 over Ni(II)FAU
is displayed in panels (i–k). An example of the ethylene-based
two-step pathway over Cu(II)FAU can be found in the Supporting Information (SI), Figure S2.

3.1 Adsorption Energies
The adsorption
geometries consisted of either ethylene or DMF η2-coordinated to the TM cation. DMF can coordinate via the C2/C3 atoms
or via the C1/C2 atoms, referred to as DMF1 and DMF2, respectively.
The adsorption energies (Eads) are listed
in Table 1. The pDOS
values of gas-phase ethylene, gas-phase DMF, 1C2/TMFAU, and 1DMF/TMFAU can be found in Figure 3. The pDOS of the
TMFAU models without reactants can be found in Figure 4. The HOMO and LUMO of DMF and ethylene are
visualized in Figure S1.

Note that we plotted the DOS associated with the hydrogen
(dashed
blue lines) and oxygen atoms (solid black) of the C2H4 or DMF molecules alongside the DOS of the C2s and
C2p (solid red) in Figure 3a. It is found that H and O contributions only increase
the intensity of the bands already represented by C2p.
The C2s lies typically too deep to be relevant (data not
shown). Hence, in Figure 3b, we omitted the H and O contributions and solely focused
on the TM cation 4s- and 3d-orbitals and ethylene or DMF C2p-orbitals. Each panel represents a TM cation, with the two parts
illustrating the DOS of 1C2 and 1DMF. The primary adsorbent is marked by the asterisk.

Inspection of the Eads values indicates
that DMF adsorption is generally about 1.5 to 2 times stronger than
ethylene adsorption. Values of Eads,DMF1 are between −130 to −165 kJ/mol in Cu(I)FAU, Cu(II)FAU,
and Zn(II)FAU, while those of ethylene are between −59 to −152
kJ/mol. Creation of the DMF2 geometry in Cu(I)FAU yielded an adsorption
energy 25 kJ/mol stronger than the DMF1 geometry. In Cr(III)FAU and
Sc(III)FAU, DMF (C2H4) adsorption energies of
−201 (−126) and −191 (−109) kJ/mol are
obtained, respectively. Calculations on the V(V)FAU model yielded
an Eads,DMF1 of −276 kJ/mol (Eads,C2 = −145 kJ/mol). Optimization of
the DMF2 adsorption geometry on V(V)FAU resulted in η1-coordinated DMF with a strong V(V)−C1 interaction.

Two DMF-adsorption geometries on the Zn(II)- and Ni(II)-cation
were obtained. In both Zn(II)FAU and Ni(II)FAU, Eads,DMF1 was −142 kJ/mol, while those of C2H4 were −99 and −108 kJ/mol, respectively.
The alternative was η1-coordination of DMF, predominantly
coordinating via C2. These geometries resulted in adsorption energies
that were 18 and 37 kJ/mol stronger than for DMF1.

To understand
the trends in adsorption energies, the σ-donor/acceptor
and π-donor/acceptor properties of the TM cations and reactants
have to be taken into account. The η2-coordinated
ethylene will act as an ethylene → TM σ-donor and TM
→ ethylene π-acceptor via the HOMO and the LUMO, respectively.
The DMF2 adsorption geometry will behave similarly. For η2-coordinated DMF1, the symmetries of the HOMO and the LUMO
make DMF1 a DMF1 → TM π-donor and TM → DMF1 σ-acceptor,
respectively.

DMF1 → TM π-donation is expected
to increase from
Cu(II), Cr(III), Sc(III) to V(V) as the d-shells become emptier. Cu(I)
and Zn(II) cannot participate in DMF1 → TM π-donation
interactions as they both have a d10 configuration. However,
the Cu(I) 3d-orbitals lie high enough in energy to allow TM →
DMF1 σ-donation. The 3d-orbitals of Zn(II) are too low in energy.
Although formally an empty orbital, the 4s-orbital could allow for
TM → DMF1 σ-donation interactions. Cu(I), Cu(II), and
Cr(III) can facilitate TM → DMF1 σ-donation, resulting
in an increase in interaction strength. Sc(III) and V(V) cannot provide
TM → DMF1 σ-donation, but compensate for this by polarizing
the reactants via strong electrostatic interactions.

A reasoning
along similar lines holds for C2H4 and DMF2
as primary adsorbent. However, C2H4/DMF2 →
TM σ-donation and TM → C2H4/DMF2
π-backdonation interactions now play a role. Consequently,
the interaction of C2H4/DMF2 with Cu(I) is stronger
than that of DMF1 with Cu(I). The high Cu(I) electron density allows
for strong π-backdonation. Another example is Cr(III). The open
shell d3 configuration allows for both DMF2 coordination
via Cr(III) → DMF2 σ-acceptor/π-donor interactions
and DMF1 which exhibits Cr(III) → DMF1 σ-donor/π-acceptor
interactions. Consequently, the ΔEads,DMF1-DMF2 is only −13 kJ/mol.

3.2 Reaction Mechanism
The reaction energies
of the DAC reaction of DMF1 (henceforth referred to as DMF, unless
stated otherwise) with ethylene over high-silica TM-exchanged faujasites
are displayed in Figure 5a–g. The solid blue lines represents the reaction energetics
of the ethylene-based pathway and solid red those of the DMF-based
reaction. In addition, Figure 5b shows the computed net atomic spin density in the DMF-based
reaction over Cu(II)FAU. Similar analyses were performed for the ethylene-
and DMF-based reactions in Cu(II)FAU, Cr(III)FAU, and Ni(II)FAU (Figure S3). Destabilization energies (Edestab.) of the zeolite and primary adsorbent
in the initial state are shown in Figure 6a. This destabilization energy is defined
as  where X refers to either
the TM-exchanged zeolite or one of the reactants taken from state 1 and its fully optimized form.

Figure 5 Reaction energy diagrams
for the different TM-exchanged faujasites
catalyzing either the ethylene- or DMF-based DAC-reaction, shown in
blue and red, respectively (a–g). In (h), the net spin density
are reported for the Cu(II)-catalyzed DMF-based DAC-reaction as the
most extreme example of radical driven reactivity. When no value is
provided, no significant net atomic spin density was found.

Figure 6 Destabilization energies and TM cation displacements
upon η2-coordination of reactants is shown in (a).
The asterisk indicates
the destabilization energy caused upon η1-coordination
of DMF to Ni(II). Summed ICOOP-values are shown in (b). The summed
ICOHP- and average BO-values are shown in panel (c) and (d), respectively.
The primary adsorbent is mentioned next to the plotted lines in panels
(b–d).

As DMF and ethylene are
both η2-coordinated, the
TM−C5/TM−C6 and TM−C2/TM−C3 interactions
were quantified by taking the summed ICOOP- and ICOHP-values (Figure 6b and Figure 6c, respectively). These results
are referenced against similar analysis performed on the previously
studied MY.45 The average TM−C2/TM−C3
and TM−C5/TM−C6 bond orders are shown in Figure 6d and have been referenced
against the average alkali−C2/alkali−C3 or alkali−C5/alkali−C6
bond orders. The net molecular charges of the d-block cations and
substrates are listed in Table 2. It is noted that one has to be careful in making a direct
quantitative comparison of ICOHP-values obtained in different models.95,96 It is claimed that this is strictly speaking not possible. However,
we find a qualitative ICOHP-trend that corresponds well with the BO-trend.
Furthermore, tests indicated that for the evaluated systems in this
study, a direct comparison of ICOHP-values is possible. These findings
will be reported in due time.

Initial State
Stability
The electronic structure of 1 was
analyzed to investigate whether the interaction between
the active site and reactants was successfully enhanced upon using
a d-block cation instead of an alkali cation.

The stability
of 1DMF is generally larger than 1C2 as apparent from Figure 5 and Figure 6a. In Cu(II)FAU and Ni(II)FAU, there is a preference of 14
and −7 kJ/mol for 1DMF, respectively.
For Cr(III)FAU, Sc(III)FAU, and V(V)FAU, differences of 20, 50, and
40 kJ/mol in favor of 1DMF are found. Cu(I)FAU
forms an exception with a 39 kJ/mol preference for 1C2. Zn(II)FAU only shows 9 kJ/mol preference for 1DMF as compared with 1C2. The
primary adsorbents deform slightly upon adsorption, but Edestab.,ethylene/DMF does not exceed 25 kJ/mol, Figure 6a. Of all the evaluated
d-block cations, Cu(I) and Cu(II) are pulled out the most of the 6-membered
ring upon interacting with the reactants. The result is Cu(I)FAU and
Cu(II)FAU being destabilized the most.

Inspection of Figure 6b shows that the
summed ICOOP-values for the reactant···d-block
cation interaction are positive (bonding overlap) and increase with
concomitant decrease in d-shell filling. This is attributed to the
fact that the d-band contributions in the TMFAU DOS get centered more
around the Fermi level such that interactions with the reactant HOMO
and LUMO are possible. However, Sc(III) and V(V) are small cations,
and the TM cation···DMF distance is large so that the
effective orbital overlap is reduced. Among the evaluated models,
Cu(I)FAU has the most bonding interactions (ICOOP = 0.11 and 0.05
in 1C2 and 1DMF, respectively)
and V(V)FAU the least (ICOOP = 0.03 and 0.02 for 1C2 and 1DMF, respectively). ICOOP-values
in MY systems are all negative, indicative of antibonding interactions.

A qualitatively similar trend is found with the ICOHP-analysis
as compared to the ICOOP-analysis (Figure 6c). Yet, while ICOOP-values for Sc(III)FAU
and V(V)FAU are low, ICOHP-values are high. This is attributed to
the large ionic contributions for which the ICOHP-function can partially
account.88 Of the evaluated MY systems,
only LiY shows a relatively high ICOHP-value of ca. −1.25 eV.
Relative to the ICOHP-values in the MY and TMFAU models, such an interaction
is considered reasonably strong for an MY system. This result, however,
is in line with lithium’s properties to form covalent bonds
with carbon.97 The significant difference
in ICOHP-values obtained in TMFAU as compared with MY indicate that
the increased orbital overlap results in strong bonding to the active
site.

For a chemical intuitive interpretation of reactant adsorption
onto the active site in the initial state, the DDEC6-derived BO analysis
was performed. This shows that BOs of the TM−C5/TM−C6
and TM−C2/TM−C3 interactions are an order of magnitude
larger than those found in the MY models (Figure 6d). While the bond orders of the alkali-cation···reactant
interactions are very close to zero, those of the TM cation···reactant
interactions are higher than 0.25 for Cu(I)-, Cu(II)-, and Ni(II)FAU.
In Zn(II)FAU and Cr(III)FAU slightly lower TM−C bond orders
are found (i.e., just below 0.25). Sc(III)FAU shows the lowest bond
order. V(V)FAU exhibits a high bond orders as well, attributed to
it being a hard Lewis acid (d0 electron configuration)
and the property to form V–O and V–C covalent bonds.

A summary of the molecular net Bader-charges is found in Table 2. TMref+ refers
to the charge of the TM cation in the absence of the reactants. The
results show that DMF is always positively charged, irrespective of
the primary adsorbent. In the ethylene-based reaction, qDMF is the largest in Cu(II)FAU (+0.66) and the lowest
in Sc(III)FAU (+0.07). In the DMF-based reaction, the molecular DMF
net charge is highest in V(V)FAU (+0.68) and lowest in Cu(I)FAU (+0.19).
An example of a charge difference (Q) visualization
concerning V(V)FAU is shown in Figure S4 (Q = Q1 – Q(TMFAU1) – Q(C2H4,1) – Q(DMF1)) and indicates that charge
is transferred to the TM cation and the zeolite framework. The charging
of DMF is in line with earlier observed electron transfer between
furanic compounds in TM-exchanged zeolites.98

Summarizing, transition metal–reactant orbital interactions
are of bonding nature, while the alkali metal−reactant orbital
interactions are of antibonding nature. In contrast to MY, ICOHP-values
are 2–6 times higher and BOs are an order of magnitude larger
in TMFAU. The strength of the TM cation···reactant
interactions qualitatively follows the expected degrees of the TM
cation σ-donor/acceptor and π-donor/acceptor properties.

DAC Reaction
The efficient orbital interactions between
the TM cation and DAC reactants identified above may give rise to
substantial charge redistributions in the reactive ensemble. However,
our calculations reveal significant electron transfer between the
reactants and the zeolite site only for the Cu(II)FAU system (Figure 5b and Figure S3). The largest accumulation of the spin
on DMF is found in the DMF-based reaction over Cu(II)FAU with a value
of 0.73 on the C5 atom in IDMF. This implies
that the DMF adsorption is accompanied by the (partial) reduction
of the copper center to an effective Cu(I) state. In the course of
the reaction, the oxidation state of the TM center is restored. The
value of spin on C5 reduces to 0.27 in TS2DMF. For the ethylene-based reaction over Cu(II)FAU, the adsorption-induced
active site reduction is less pronounced. The η1-coordination
of C2H4 (Cu(II)−C5) with the paramagnetic
active site gives rise to a spin-moment of only 0.22 on C6. No substantial
adsorption-induced reduction is observed for other open shell TM cations
such as Cr(III) and Ni(II). Spin-moments on the organic molecules
in the adsorption complexes do not exceed an absolute value of 0.15.
The reduction of Cu(II) and the invariable spin density on Cr(III)
were also found experimentally in Cu(II)- and Cr(III)-exchanged clay-based
DAC-catalysts.52

The coupling in
all other systems can be described as proceeding via a zwitterionic
intermediate, although charge changes are small (|Δq| ≈ 0.1). In the C2-based reaction following the two-step
pathway, electron density accumulates on the carbon atom bound to
the TM cation (CTM) when going from 1C2 to IC2. Meanwhile, the terminal
carbon atom in the C2-moiety is characterized by a reduction in electron
density. Additionally, the carbon atom in DMF and opposite to CTM in IC2 is characterized by an increase
net positive charge as compared to the CDMF-atom that has
already participated in the first C–C bond formation. For the
DMF-based reaction following the two-step pathway, an electron density
increase was observed on the terminal C atom of the C2-moiety with
the opposite CDMF-atom having an increased net positive
charge. In both the C2- and DMF-based reactions, the combination of
the net positive and net negative charge is considered to be the driving
force for the formation of the second C–C bond.

Next
we analyze more specifically the orbital interactions within
each of the reactive systems and the changes in the bonding patterns
during the DAC reaction. The bond orders between the TM cation and
the primary adsorbents along the reaction coordinate (r.c.) are reported
in Figure 7, Table S1, and Table S2. Bond orders are typically
referred to interacting pairs in the text (e.g., TM−C2/TM−C3
and C1–C6/C4−C5). In the following, we first conduct
a detailed analysis per model and then close with a summary describing
the trends. Note that we always refer to DMF1 when mentioning DMF
as primary adsorbent. All the obtained geometries over all evaluated
TMFAU catalysts can be found in Figures S5–S7.

Figure 7 Barplots of TM−C and C–C bond orders along the reaction
coordinate for the various d-block cations in the ethylene- and DMF-based
pathways. Bonds of interest are highlighted in red or blue. Note that
these colors have no relation with the colors in the legend and the
bars. They only refer to the accompanying text in the graph.

Cu(I)FAU
The relative
stabilities (defined as the coadsorption
energies) of 1C2 and 1DMF are −189 and −150 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure 5). The activation barriers Eact,1→TS,C2 and Eact,1→TS,DMF are 144 and
54 kJ/mol, respectively. Overall, the ethylene-based reaction is endothermic
with 116 kJ/mol and the DMF-based reaction is exothermic with 76 kJ/mol.

The 4s and 3d-orbitals of Cu(I) are close to the Fermi level (Figure 4). In Figure 3, it is seen that the d-orbitals
and the 4s-orbital are at the same energy level as the ethylene HOMO.
Because the d-shell is completely filled, we believe that it is predominantly
the 4s-shell that accepts the electrons from ethylene via ethylene
→ Cu(I) σ-donation. The ethylene LUMO interacts with
a band originating from d-orbitals. Consequently, the η2-coordination of ethylene to the Cu(I)-cation results in a enorm,C2 and einv,C2 of 2.69 and 5.56 eV, respectively. The η2-coordination
of DMF to Cu(I) in the DMF-based reaction results in the HOMO of DMF
having the same energy as a d-band from Cu(I) and a contribution of
the Cu(I) 4s orbital at the DMF LUMO. The result is an enorm,DMF of 4.31 eV and an einv,DMF of 4.6 eV.

During the reaction, Cu(I)−C5/Cu(I)−C6
bond orders
in the ethylene-based reaction change from 0.48/0.48 in 1C2 to 0.27/0.18 in 2C2, Figure 7. In TSC2, the bond orders are 0.37/0.31. Accordingly, C1–C6/C4−C5
bond orders change from 0 in 1C2 to 0.8/0.76
in 2C2 with BOs of 0.36/0.32 in TSC2. In the case of the DMF-based reaction, the TM−C2/TM−C3
BOs are 0.5/0.24 in 1DMF and increase to 0.41/0.56
in 2DMF. Bond order values of Cu(I)−C2/Cu(I)−C3
in TSDMF are 0.39/0.44. Along the reaction
coordinate, the C1–C6/C4−C5 BOs change from 0.01/0.01
to 019/0.19 and 0.92/0.91 in 1DMF, TSDMF, and 2DMF respectively.

Cu(II)FAU
The DAC reactions over Cu(II)FAU start from
initial states 1C2 and 1DMF with energies of −173 and −187 kJ/mol, respectively
(Figure 5). Upon η2-coordination of ethylene to Cu(II), contributions of both
the Cu(II) d-orbitals and the HOMO and LUMO of ethylene to the same
band are observed, Figure 3. Ethylene → Cu(II) σ-donation and Cu(II) →
ethylene π-backbonding are possible due to the d9 electron configuration of Cu(II). Qualitatively similar results
are found for the DMF-based reaction, where the Cu(II) d-orbitals
and HOMO/LUMO contribute to the same bands, enabling Cu(II) →
DMF σ-donation and DMF → Cu(II) π-donation. The enorm (einv) for
the ethylene- and DMF-based reactions are 4.03 (0.64) eV and 1.06
(5.28) eV, respectively.

The Eact,1→TS1,C2 and Eact,1→TS1,DMF amount to 30 and 54 kJ/mol, respectively.
Those of Eact,I→TS2,C2 and Eact,I→TS2,DMF are 92 and 17 kJ/mol, respectively. It should be noted that in IC2 the maximum spin density is found to be 0.22,
whereas that of IDMF is 0.73. So, in the latter
situation there is a large driving force for the second C–C
coupling as compared with the first case. Upon formation of a net
spin moment on the carbon atoms, Cu(II) is reduced due to reduction
potential favoring this process,99 in line
with earlier experimental observations.52 The overall reaction is endothermic for both the ethylene- and DMF-based
reaction with 66 and 37 kJ/mol. However, the second step is most endothermic
for the ethylene-based reaction (59 kJ/mol), while the first step
is most endothermic for the DMF-based reaction (36 kJ/mol).

Cu(II)−C bond orders for Cu(II)−C5/Cu(II)−C6
are 0.37/0.37 in 1C2, but they decrease to
an insignificant 0.03/0.02 in 2C2, Figure 7. The intermediate
state 1C2 exhibits Cu(II)−C5/Cu(II)−C6
(C1–C6/C4−C5) BOs of 0.55/0.04 (0.79/0.03) indicating
a η1-coordinated ethylene with a net spin density
on C5 of 0.22. For the DMF-based reaction, Cu(II)−C2/Cu(II)−C3
BOs change from 0.3/0.3 in 1DMF to 0.25/0.24
in 2DMF. Although a significant spin moment
has developed on the C6 atom (0.73) in IDMF, the Cu(II)−C2/Cu(II)−C3 BOs remain relatively modest
as compared with the ethylene-based reaction with 0.38/0.35. Yet,
the C1–C6 bond is well-developed in IDMF as indicated by a BO of 0.84. In 2DMF, both
C–C bonds will have a BO of 0.9 in 2DMF.

Zn(II)FAU
The stabilities of both 1C2/Zn(II)FAU and 1DMF/Zn(II)FAU are
very similar to those found in 1/Cu(I)FAU, Figure 5. For the ethylene- and DMF-based
reactions the energies of 1 are −151 and −160
kJ/mol, respectively. The Zn(II) reference DOS (Figure 4) and the pDOS of the ethylene- and DMF-based
initial states (Figure 3) show that the d-orbitals are too low in energy to play a significant
role. From this we infer that the major orbital interaction between
ethylene and Zn(II) arises from the Zn(II) s-orbital with the HOMO
and LUMO of ethylene. A similar observation is done for the DMF-based
reaction. The interaction with Zn(II) results in an enorm,C2 (einv,C2) of 2.6 (2.59)
eV and enorm,DMF (einv,DMF) of 5.24 (4.01) eV for the C2- and DMF-based reaction,
respectively.

Zn(II)−C bond orders in IC2 are high with values for Zn(II)−C2/Zn(II)−C3
of 0.66/0.04, Figure 7. The overall reaction is endothermic with 24 kJ/mol while formation
of IC2 is an exothermic process with a ΔE of 5 kJ/mol. The DMF-based reaction is exothermic with
30 kJ/mol.

The Zn(II) → DMF σ-donation and DMF
→ Zn(II)
π-donation both deal with an empty Zn(II) 4s-shell. In combination
with steric hindrance from the framework, the DMF-based reaction proceeds
via a one-step pathway which is overall exothermic with 30 kJ/mol.
The barrier, however, is relatively high with 65 kJ/mol.

For
ethylene, the Zn(II)−C5/Zn(II)−C6 bond orders
change from 0.21/0.22 in 1C2 to 0.10/0.13
in 2C2, Figure 7. In IC2, these values have
become 0.04/0.66 and are accompanied by C1–C6/C4−C5
BOs of 0.03/0.75. In 2C2 the C1–C6/C4−C5
BOs are 0.80/0.85. During the DMF-based reaction involving the one-step
pathway, the DMF-moiety remains η2-coordinated as
evidenced by TSDMF Zn(II)−C2/Zn(II)−C3
BOs of 0.17/0.28. The C1–C6/C4−C5 BOs are relatively
low as compared to the ethylene-based pathway with just 0.17/0.27,
but they evolve to C1–C6/C4−C5 bonds with BOs of 0.88/0.89.

Ni(II)FAU
The Ni(II) DOS exhibits d-bands just above
and below the Fermi level, Figure 4. This allows for proper ethylene → Ni(II) σ-donation
and Ni(II) → ethylene π-backbonding and Ni(II) →
DMF σ-donation and DMF → Ni(II) π-donation. The
resulting initial states 1C2 and 1DMF are −163 and −156 kJ/mol lower in energy
than in the situation of all components in the gas phase, respectively
(Figure 5). Energy
gaps are 0.4 and 0.59 eV for enorm and einv in the ethylene-based reaction, respectively.
Formation of the reactive complex is easy as both the ethylene and
DMF DOS display bands at the Fermi level, Figure 3. For the DMF-based reaction, enorm and einv are 5.24 and
1.16 eV, respectively.

The ethylene-based reaction is an endothermic
reaction of 38 kJ/mol. An equilibrium is established between TS2C2 and 2C2 indicating
that the retro-DAC can take place easily. We note that the energy
difference between these two states is only 1 kJ/mol, and given the
flexibility of the current zeolite models and its complexity, it can
be regarded as being within the error margin of our DFT calculations.
The DMF-based pathway is characterized by a low first activation barrier
of just 29 kJ/mol. The overall reaction is exothermic and state 2DMF is 52 kJ/mol lower in energy. The retro-DAC
cannot take place as easily as in the case of the ethylene-based reaction
as the retro-DAC activation barrier is 81 kJ/mol. For both the ethylene-
and DMF-based reactions, net spin moments were found to be not larger
than 0.1 (only once, for one atom, a net spin density of 0.13 is found), Figure S3. No significant spin changes on the
Ni(II) active site were observed.

The TM−C bond orders
for both the C2- and DMF-based
reactions were found to be nearly as large as those found in 1/Cu(II)FAU, Figure 7. All BO values were ca. 0.29. In the ethylene-based reaction,
TM−C bond orders change to 0.04/0.25 for Ni(II)−C5/Ni(II)−C6
in TS2C2 and eventually to 0.06/0.09 in 2C2. The C1–C6/C4−C5 BOs are 0.29/0.83
in TS2C2 and continue to increase to 0.81/0.85
in 2C2. For the DMF-based reaction, Ni(II)−C2/Ni(II)−C3
bond orders go from 0.07/0.38 in TS1DMF to
0.21/0.24 in 2DMF. A concomitant change in
C1–C6/C4−C5 bond orders is found, from 0.07/0.32 in TS1DMF to 0.99/0.99 in 2DMF.

Cr(III)FAU
The DOS of Cr(III)FAU without substrates
exhibits d-bands below, nearly at and above the Fermi level, Figure 4. This is expected
to allow for significant ethylene → Cr(III) σ-donation
and Cr(III) → ethylene π-backbonding and Cr(III) →
DMF σ-donation and DMF → Cr(III) π-donation. The
resulting energy gaps are 0.4 eV (5.48 eV) and 0.6 eV (0.53 eV) for
the normal and inverse electron mechanisms in the ethylene-(DMF-)based
reaction, respectively, as deduced from the DOS in Figure 3. The orbital interactions
between Cr(III) and the reactants are significant. Additionally, as
an electrophile, Cr(III) polarizes the reactants. The result is state 1C2 and 1DMF of −200
and −220 kJ/mol, respectively, Figure 5. Formation of the intermediate state IC2 for the ethylene-based pathway occurs without
barrier and is exothermic with 47 kJ/mol. The second coupling step IC2 → 2C2 is endothermic
by 116 kJ/mol and proceeds without a barrier. An additional intermediate II was located along the reaction path that precedes 2C2. No transition state between IC2 and II was found, from which we infer
that the loss of the Cr(III)−substrate interaction partially
accounts for the energy required to form the second C–C bond.
The cleavage of the Cr(III)−C bond in II and the
formation of the reaction 2C2 is slightly
endothermic with ΔEII→2C2 = 8 kJ/mol. Thus, the retro-DAC can happen
easily, just like the ethylene-based reaction over Ni(II)FAU. The
DMF-based reaction result in the formation of the DAC adduct 2DMF (−222 kJ/mol) after a barrier of 43
kJ/mol has been crossed. During the reaction, net atomic spin moments
do not exceed an absolute value of 0.15. The largest spin moment is
located at the DMF methyl side groups in 1C2, Figure S3. Cr(III) is not undergoing
spin changes, nor does it accept electron density from any of the
adsorbents. This is in line with earlier work on Cr(III)-exchanged
clays.52

The changes in bond orders
can be found in Figure 7. The bond orders of the Cr(III)−C5/Cr(III)−C6 interactions
are 0.14/0.14 in 1C2 and those of Cr(III)−C2/Cr(III)−C3
are 0.19/0.2 in 1DMF. Formation of state IC2 is accompanied by Cr(III)−C5/Cr(III)−C6
BOs of 0.29/0.08, which gradually evolve to 0.07/0.07 in 2C2 via values of 0.13/0.08 in TS2C2. C1–C6/C4−C5 bond orders in IC2 are small and only 0.12/0.03. They become relatively developed in II with values of 0.84/0.54. In 2C2, C1–C6/C4−C5 BOs are 0.88/0.87. For DMF, the Cr(III)−C2/Cr(III)−C3
bond orders become 0.35/0.06 in TS2DMF and
eventually become 0.19/0.11 in 2DMF. The C1–C6/C4−C5
bond orders are 0.88/0.35 in TS2DMF and eventually
0.86/0.82 in 2DMF.

Sc(III)FAU
The
reference DOS of Sc(III)FAU shows major
3d-contributions at 2 eV and higher above the Fermi level, Figure 4. A contribution
of the 4s orbital is also found near 2 eV. Only minor d-orbital contributions
are found below the Fermi level. Thus, only ethylene → Sc(III)
and σ-donation DMF → Sc(III) π-donation are possible,
in conjunction with strong ionic interactions with the highly Lewis
acidic Sc(III) cation. The normal and inverse electron demand energy
gaps of the ethylene-based reaction are both 0.65 eV. Those of the
DMF-based reaction are 5.93 and 2.52 eV, respectively.

The C2-based
reaction starts with the primary adsorption of ethylene resulting
in the state 1C2 with an energy of −160
kJ/mol, Figure 5. It
proceeds to IC2, which is uphill with 13 kJ/mol.
The second activation barrier is 22 kJ/mol after which 2C2 is reached (−156 kJ/mol). The DMF-based reaction
proceeds via an asynchronous concerted transition state (TSDMF, −128 kJ/mol) with a barrier of 82 kJ/mol.
The final state 2DMF is similar in energy
to the initial state.

Inspection of Figure 7 shows that the Sc(III)−C5/Sc(III)−C6
bond orders are
only 0.11/0.09 in 1C2, 0.32/0.05 in IC2 and 0.23/0.06 in TS2C2. The bond orders restore to the initial values in 2C2, with 0.12/0.12. The C1–C6/C4−C5 carbon–carbon
bonds are 0.35/0.05 in IC2. These C1–C6/C4−C5
bonds eventually reach values of 0.82/0.82 in 2C2 via TS2C2 characterized by BOs of 0.71/0.23
for C1–C6/C4−C5. For the DMF-based reaction, Sc(III)−C2/Sc(III)−C3
bond orders change from 0.15/0.13 in 1DMF to
0.12/0.08 in 2DMF via values of 0.22/0.07
in TS2DMF. Bond order values of C1–C6/C4−C5
are 0.12/0.36 in TSDMF and reach 0.89/0.89
in 2DMF.

V(V)FAU
Analysis
of Figure 4 shows that
the d-DOS exhibits peaks at and
just above the Fermi level. There is also a relatively small contribution
of the 4s-orbital at the Fermi level. As V(V) is also a d0 d-block cation, only ethylene → V(V) σ-donation DMF
→ V(V) π-donation are possible. As a small and pentavalent
d-block cation, polarization of the reactants is significant and results
in strong interactions. The normal and inverse demand energy gap have
become 1.15 and 3.55 eV for the ethylene-based reaction, respectively
(Figure 3). Those of
the DMF-based reaction are 6.64 and 0.11 eV, respectively.

Both
for the ethylene- and the DMF-based reaction, the initial state is
very stable, being −253 (1C2) and −293
(1DMF) kJ/mol, respectively. Formation of
the first C–C bond results in a dormant state 2C2 or 2DMF, with energies of −378
and −394 kJ/mol, respectively. As a lot of energy has to be
invested (188 and 155 kJ/mol for the C2- and DMF-based
reactions, respectively) in releasing the strongly bound reactive
complex from the V(V) cation, no activation energy could be determined.
Note that IDMF is characterized by an intermediate
resembling 2-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-1(7),3-diene coordinated via C2
to the V(V) active site. This illustrates the significant activation
of the C1–C2 and C2–C3 conjugated bonds making both
C1 and C3 very reactive.

Bond orders in 1C2 for V(V)−C5/V(V)−C6
are 0.17/0.16, Figure 7. A strong vanadium–carbon interaction is formed, evidenced
by V(V)−C5/V(V)−C6 BOs or 0.47/0.01 in IC2. Formation of the DAC adduct reduces these values to
0.12/0.11. Meanwhile, C1–C6/C4−C5 bond orders are 0.9/0.02
in IC2 and change to 0.46/0.52 in 2C2. For the DMF-based reaction, V(V)−C2/V(V)−C3
BOs are 0.22/0.18, reach a significant 1.01/0.43 in IDMF and reduce to 0.09/0.15 in 2DMF. The bond orders for C1–C6/C4−C5 are 0.06/0.93 in IDMF and 0.83/0.85 in 2DMF.

4 Summary and Discussion
The DAC reaction can proceed via the one- or two-step pathway in
first row d-block exchanged faujasites. The TM cation d-shell filling
and the steric constraints imposed by the zeolite framework directly
influence the reaction mechanism. The DAC reaction is preceded by
η2-coordination of the primary reactant to the active
site. The η1-coordination and consequently the activation
of the primary adsorbent initiates the two-step pathway.

Among
the evaluated models, only in Cu(I)FAU is the synchronous
concerted one-step pathway found involving 1, TS and 2 for both the ethylene- and DMF-based reaction.

Additionally, only in Cu(II)- and Zn(II)FAU does the ethylene-based
reaction proceed via the two-step pathway involving 1, TS1, I, TS2, and 2. The DMF-based reaction in Cu(II)FAU follows a two-step pathway
too. When using Zn(II)FAU, formation of a η1-coordinated
reactive complex is not possible in the DMF-based reaction due to
steric hindrance created by the framework. This induces an asynchronous
one-step pathway for the DMF-based reaction.

The effects of
TM cation···substrate interactions
and steric factors due to the interactions between substrates and
the framework are well illustrated by the different behavior of Cu(I)-,
Cu(II)-, and Zn(II)FAU systems in the DAC reaction. Geometries of
the selected transition state and intermediate structures in Cu(I)-,
Cu(II)-, and Zn(II)FAU are shown in Figure 8. Cation dislocations in the z-direction with respect to the plane parallel to the atoms making
up the FAU 6MR are shown in addition to cation···reactive
complex interaction distances. The three cations adopt substantially
different configurations within the zeolite 6MR sites resulting in
a different shielding by lattice oxygen atoms and, accordingly, different
effective accessibility of the exchangeable cation. The data in Figure 8 show that Zn(II)
occupies a highly shielded central position within the 6MR site of
FAU, while Cu(I) effectively sits above the zeolite ring and Cu(II)
adopts a position intermediate to the two other extreme cases.

Cation···6MR distances defined as the absolute change
in z-position with respect to the plane going through the atoms making
up the 6MR. TM···reactive complex interaction distances
are also shown.

The η2-coordination of ethylene to the exposed
Cu(I) cation can be described in the framework of the classical Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson
model, according to which the bonding within the adsorption complex
stems from the Cu(I) ← ethylene σ-donor and Cu(I) →
ethylene π-acceptor interactions. The latter orbital interaction
is established between the dxz/dyz orbitals of Cu(I) and the ethylene LUMO. For the
DMF-based reaction, the binding in the adsorption complexes is aided
through the Cu(I) → DMF σ-acceptor-type interactions.
These are provided through the overlap between the Cu(I) 3dz2 orbital and the DMF LUMO. The symmetry of the 3dz2 orbital allows for both η1-
or η2-type coordination. The cylcoadduct in TSDMF qualitatively exhibits orbital symmetry similar
to that of ethylene in 1C2, Figure S1. Thus, we hypothesize that the η2-coordination of the reactive complex in TSDMF to the accessible Cu(I) cation enables a one-step mechanism. Additionally,
the kinetic preference for either the ethylene- or DMF-based pathway
is governed by the stability of the respective TS structures.
In TSC2, the orbital symmetry of the reactive
complex is inappropriate for suitable orbital interactions and is
consequently higher in energy than TSDMF.

The reactive site in Cu(II)FAU is in the d9 electron
configuration. The analysis of the spin density in the intermediates
along the DAC path (Figure 5h) suggests a partial reduction of Cu(II) upon the formation
of a Cu–C bond to produce a C-centered radical intermediate.
Because the cation is sufficiently accessible to both the relatively
large DMF and small C2H4 moieties, the reaction
can proceed via a two-step pathway involving 1, TS1, I, TS2, and 2.
Orbital symmetry considerations in line with those for the TSc2/TSDMF in Cu(I)FAU dictate the
kinetic preference for the DMF-based pathway in Cu(II)FAU.

For
the DAC reaction in Zn(II)FAU, the Zn(II)···substrate
interactions are exclusively governed by the overlap between Zn(II)
4s orbital and the substrate FMOs. The 3d-orbitals lie too deep in
energy to play any significant role in bonding (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Because Zn(II) is effectively embedded into the
6MR, only ethylene can coordinate to it and form relatively strong
Zn–C contacts. In the case of the DMF-based pathway over Zn(II)FAU,
the formation of a tightly bound η1-coordination
complex is sterically hindered. This results in a higher TSDMF energy compared to TSC2 and
the DMF-based DAC reaction proceeds via an asynchronous concerted
one-step mechanism.

Similar reasoning allows for rationalization
of the differences
in the preferred mechanistic paths for other cations considered in
this study. However, the substantial cationic charge along with the
partially filled 3d-shells allow for a stronger substrate coordination
compared to that established with the late d-block metal cations.
As a result, for Ni(II)-, Cr(III)-, Sc(III)-, and V(V)FAU the ethylene-based
reaction follows a two-step pathway lacking TS1, I, TS2, or a combination thereof.

For instance,
in Cr(III)FAU, no TS1 is found. The
lack of TS1 is attributed to the significant activation
of the reactant upon adsorption as indicated by the small energy gaps
in 1 resulting from the efficient orbital overlap interactions.
The computed bond orders indicate that the identified pathways belong
to a two-step mechanism. For example, the C2-based reaction in Cu(I)FAU
follows a one-step mechanism with C1–C6/C4−C5 BOs 0.36/0.32.
In contrast, the C4–C5 BOs in IC2 in
Cr(III)-, Sc(III)-, and V(V)FAU are close to zero. Another example
is TS2C2 in Ni(II)FAU and Sc(III)FAU,
for which we find BOs of 0.29/0.83 and 0.71/0.23 for C1–C6/C4−C5,
respectively. The high BOs of ca. 0.7–0.8 for one of the C–C
bonds in TS2C2 is the main motivation for
disregarding this state as corresponding to an asynchronous concerted
one-step mechanism. Such a high bond order suggests that one of the
bonds is much more evolved in the transition state than found for
the synchronous concerted one-step reaction in this work (e.g., the
DAC reaction over Cu(I)FAU).

The DMF-based reaction over Sc(III)FAU
is mechanistically similar
to that established for Zn(II)FAU. The steric hindrance between the
reactive complex and the framework in this case also enforces an asynchronous
one-step mechanism. When the strongly electrophilic V(V)-cation is
the active site, intermediate I becomes a dormant state
for both the ethylene- and DMF-based reactions.

To put these
results in perspective, the framework···substrate
interactions are very similar to the steric interactions that substrates
experience in enzymes and supramolecular complexes.60−66 For the studied DAC reaction in this work, such interactions have
no effect on regio- and stereoselectivity. It is hypothesized, though,
that DAC reactions between substituted dienes and/or dienophiles may
experience a change in regio- and stereoselectivity. For instance,
we expect that the formation of the anti-intermediate as reported
for the two-step diradical DAC reaction between 1,3-butadiene and
ethylene in the gas phase100 does not take
place in the current systems due to the stabilizing dispersion ethylene···zeolite
framework interactions and pronounced steric hindrance due to the
DMF methyl groups. Furthermore, the equatorial coordination sites
of the TM cations are occupied by the framework oxygen atoms in all
models. Thus, in contrast to homogeneous TM-based catalysts,48,56,58,59 neither metallacycles can be formed nor can the second reactant
be coordinated prior to the DAC reaction.

The increasing activation
of reactants upon a decreasing d-shell
electron occupation is illustrated by the energy gaps. Energy gaps
in the 3d10-TM cations Cu(I)- and Zn(II)FAU range from
2.59 to 5.57 eV. For Cu(II)FAU, einv,C2 (enorm,DMF) is 0.64 eV (1.06 eV)
with the other energy gaps higher than 4 eV. For Ni(II)-, Cr(III)-,
Sc(III)-, and V(V)FAU, at least one energy gap is below 1.16 eV in
both the ethylene- and DMF-based reactions. This significant activation
is the reason that TS1 in the two-step pathway is generally
absent in these systems. To put this in context, the reported TMFAU
energy gaps are significantly lower than those in alkali-exchanged
faujasites (>5 eV).45

The DAC
activation energies in the evaluated TMFAU catalysts for
the majority of the two-step pathways are in the order of 10–50
kJ/mol. For I → TS2 and I → II in the ethylene-based reaction over Cu(II)FAU and Cr(III)FAU, we
found barriers of 92 and 108 kJ/mol, respectively. Activation barriers
associated with the one-step pathway range between 54 to 144 kJ/mol.
For instance, the DMF-based one-step reaction in Cu(I)FAU, Zn(II)FAU,
and Sc(III)FAU exhibits barriers of 54, 65, and 82 kJ/mol. Thus, most
of the two-step pathways over TMFAU proceed with activation barriers
lower than those previously reported for high- and low-silica alkali-exchanged
faujasites (70–110 kJ/mol).25−27,45 In general, the activation barriers along the one-step paths are
reminiscent to those found for alkali-exchanged faujasites.

The observed activation of double bonds in this work is in accordance
with the existing DAC-theory on diene/dienophile activation by electron-withdrawing
and -donating groups.101 Upon η1-coordination of ethylene in TS1, the terminal
carbon atom is activated and participates in the formation of the
first C–C bond. Similarly, the carbon atoms next to CTM are activated when DMF is η1-coordinated. For instance,
when C2 is CTM, the C1–C5 bond is the first bond
to form. Additionally, in V(V)FAU, 2-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-1(7),3-diene
is formed rather than 1,4-dimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene as
a consequence of significant activation of C3.

The computed
bond orders indicate strong TM−C5/TM−C6
and TM−C2/TM−C3 interactions in 1DMF and 1C2, respectively. Typically, BOs in 1C2 and 1DMF are similar
and range between 0.1 and 0.5. However, 2DMF is usually more stable than 2C2. This is
attributed to the fact that during the reaction the C2/C3 carbon atoms
remain sp2-hybridized, whereas the hybridization of C5/C6
changes to sp3 resulting in an orbital mismatch with the
d-orbitals of the TM cation. Consequently, BOs in 2DMF are more than 1.5 times larger than those in 2C2. The loss of C5/C6 sp2-hybridization and
consequently the loss of appropriate orbital symmetry for interaction
with the cation d-orbitals explains the relatively high Eact,TS2→2 and Eact,I→II for the ethylene-based reaction
and very similar energies for TS2C2/2C2 and II/2C2 pairs in Ni(II)- and Cr(III)FAU, respectively.

Considering
the discussion above, we propose that the DAC reactivity
of the TMFAU model catalysts can be rationalized by the d-block donor–acceptor
properties and orbital symmetry considerations. The metal cations
with less filled d-shells bind the unsaturated substrates stronger
due to both the increased ability to accept electrons from the adsorbed
species and the increase in net cationic charge. Both these effects
contribute to the enhanced substrate activation.

Carbon rehybridization
in the course of the DAC reaction dictates
to which extend the favorable TM → substate donor–acceptor
interactions can be maintained. For the ethylene-based reactions,
carbon rehybridization reduces the effective orbital overlap, while
it is maintained in the DMF-based paths resulting in a reduced stability
of the species formed along the ethylene-based path. The DMF-based
reaction channel in the case of small d-metal cations suffers from
pronounced steric hindrance excreted by the zeolite framework, which
effectively counteracts the favorable orbital symmetries.

5 Conclusions
Herein, we reported on a periodic DFT study
focused on a mechanistic
understanding of the DAC reaction between DMF and ethylene using first
row d-block metal cation (TM = Cu(I), Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Cr(III),
Sc(III), V(V))-exchanged high-silica faujasite catalysts. Changes
to the DAC reaction mechanism as a function of the d-shell occupation
were discussed. The TM···reactant interactions were
quantified using the COHP- and COOP-functions and the DDEC6-based
bond order analysis.

Due to the symmetry of the TM cation d-orbitals,
σ-donor/acceptor
and π-donor/acceptor interactions can be established with both
the DMF and ethylene FMOs. An increase in reactant activation is found
upon a decrease in d-shell filling. This is evidenced by the resulting
small energy gaps and low activation energies.

Cu(II)FAU, Ni(II)FAU,
and Cr(III)FAU catalyzed both the ethylene-
and DMF-based DAC reactions via a two-step pathway. In Zn(II)FAU and
Sc(III)FAU, a two-step pathway was observed for the C2-based reaction
while an asynchronous one-step pathway for the DMF-based reaction
was found. This change in mechanism is attributed to the small radii
of the cations which are less accessible for the DMF-based reactive
complex due to steric hindrance with the framework. Both the ethylene-
and DMF-based DAC reaction in Cu(I)FAU exhibited a one-step DAC-reaction
mechanism. The Cu(I) cation shows an enhanced accessibility to both
primary adsorbents. The orbital symmetries in 1C2 and TSDMF enable the DAC reaction to proceed
via a one-step mechanism. The highly electrophilic V(V) cation causes
the formation of a dormant intermediate state.

This work is
an example of how reactivity and reaction mechanisms
are influenced by the properties of the active site and the direct
chemical environment exerting steric constraints on the reactive complex.
