Bandshape
luminescence thermometry during in situ temperature measurements
has been reported by preparing three catalytically relevant systems,
which show temperature-dependent luminescence. One of these systems
was further investigated as a showcase for application. Microcrystalline
NaYF4 doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ was
mixed with a commercial zeolite H-ZSM-5 to investigate the Methanol-to-Hydrocarbons
(MTH) reaction, while monitoring the reaction products with online
gas chromatography. Due to the exothermic nature of the MTH reaction,
a front of increased temperature migrating down the fixed reactor
bed was visualized, showing the potential for various applications
of luminescence thermometry for in situ measurements in catalytic
systems.

==== Body
To optimize the activity, selectivity,
and stability of catalytic reactions, it is important to optimize
parameters such as reaction temperature. However, interparticle heterogeneities
and local gradients in the reactor due to exothermal or endothermal
processes can result in lower or higher catalyst performances and
even reactor runaways.1 Although the local
temperature profile is very important for catalytic performance in
view of the Arrhenius equation, local temperature fluctuations are
still difficult to analyze properly. To investigate the local temperature
fluctuations, it is important to have a thermometry technique, which
is noninvasive and has a high spatial and temporal resolution.

Bandshape luminescence thermometry2,3 is a promising
method to locally measure temperatures noninvasively. This technique
exploits two thermally coupled emitting states, which show temperature-dependent
luminescence upon excitation because of a Boltzmann distribution of
the emitting states. A great advantage of this technique is that it
is based on the intensity ratio of emission from two states and is
therefore independent of probe concentration or fluctuations in the
excitation or light collection efficiency.

Bandshape luminescence
thermometry has already been investigated
thoroughly for bioimaging application using lanthanide doped organic
complexes.4 By incorporating lanthanide
ions, for example, Er3+, in inorganic (nano)crystals,5 the temperature range has been expanded,6,7 resulting in a wider range of applications eligible for luminescence
thermometry.8,9

To understand the performance
of a catalyst, it is important to
investigate it under working conditions, resulting in an active field
of catalyst research. In situ measurements are a powerful tool to
expand our knowledge of catalytic systems. The simultaneous evaluation
of the catalyst itself and the reaction products via, for example,
gas chromatography (GC), can also give mechanistic insight in catalyst
reactions and related deactivation pathways.

Previous in situ
measurements to visualize a temperature gradient
along a catalyst bed have been performed with either IR-thermography,10,11 NMR-thermometry,12 or using multiple
thermocouples13 to monitor the temperature
at different heights in a catalyst bed. For IR-thermography and NMR-thermometry,
the resolution is limited typically to the mm range. Furthermore,
the data interpretation for NMR-thermometry can be both cumbersome
and dependent on the concentration of the probed species, while the
interpretation of IR-thermography might become difficult if light
absorbing species are present in the reactor. The use of thermocouples
also yields a very limited spatial resolution and the noninvasiveness
of the technique cannot be guaranteed. Hence, there is clear room
for improved reactor and catalyst particle thermometry.

In this
work, we demonstrate the potential for luminescence thermometry
as an in situ measurement technique during catalytic processes. Therefore,
three different systems have been prepared, all with different length
scales to enable thermometry with varying spatial resolution. SEM
micrographs of microcrystalline NaYF4 of ca. 5–20
μm (a), 50 nm NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) deposited
on a Al2O3 support (b) and finally a photograph
of NaYF4 NPs incorporated in extrudates (c) are shown in Figure 1. The NPs have a
NaYF4 core of ca. 20 nm and a SiO2 shell to
prevent sintering of particles and therefore increase the thermal
stability. In all cases the NaYF4 was doped with Er3+ and Yb3+, resulting in characteristic temperature-dependent
luminescence.14,15

The insets show the temperature-dependent luminescence of the systems
as discussed in the Supporting Information.

Luminescence studies showed temperature-dependent
luminescence
behavior for all three samples upon upconversion excitation14 at 980 nm, as shown in the insets of Figure 1. Here, the log of
the intensity ratio of the two emitting states (4S3/2 and 2H11/2 excited state) is plotted
vs reciprocal temperature. The linear fits are used to determine the
reaction temperature from a spectral output with an accuracy of 1
to 5 K. A more detailed presentation of the luminescence studies can
be found in our earlier work15 and Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information (SI).

To further investigate the applicability of the systems, the microcrystalline
NaYF4 was used as a showcase during the Methanol-to-Hydrocarbons
(MTH) reaction by mixing it with a commercial, solid catalyst, zeolite
H-ZSM-5, in a fixed bed reactor.

The NaYF4:Er,Yb
in the reactor could be excited, using
a fiber probe and temperature-dependent luminescence spectra were
collected with the same fiber probe from different heights in the
catalyst bed during the reaction. The reaction temperature was calculated
from the luminescence output over the course of the reaction. It was
shown that the local temperature during in situ measurements can be
measured very accurately in a noninvasive manner.

The setup
used during these experiments is shown in Figure S2. In MTH, after a short induction time,
100% of the methanol is converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons
with dimethyl ether (DME) as intermediate product (according to the
simplified reaction of the MTH process: 2 CH3OH ⇄
CH3OCH3 + H2O → Light olefins
+ H2O).

Under the current reaction conditions (discussed
in SI), using H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) as catalyst,
the main products of this reaction are propylene, ethylene, and C4 olefins as was measured with online GC (Figure S3).

Extensive research has been done on the
mechanism of this MTH process
and the hydrocarbon pool mechanism is currently the most widely accepted
reaction mechanism.16−18 The conversion of methanol into light olefins is
exothermic, and the ΔH of the formation of
typical reaction products, e.g., ethylene and propylene is −11
and −42 kJ mol–1, respectively.19 The methanol is introduced at the top of the
reactor and fully converted in the top of the catalyst bed. Therefore,
it is expected that the heat production is initially the highest at
the top of the catalyst bed. Due to coke deposition, the catalyst
deactivates over time,20−23 resulting in a longer path length of the methanol before it reaches
active sites to do the conversion. In this way, only a small part
of the bed moving down through the reactor is active toward methanol
conversion. The combination of the exothermic nature of the reaction
and the deactivation of the catalyst results in a heat front in the
catalyst bed that shifts from top to bottom over time.

The three
temperature profiles that were measured at the top, middle
and bottom of the catalyst bed during the MTH reaction are shown in Figure 2. A trend-line is
drawn through the data points to guide the eye. The temperature uncertainty24 of the technique is very low at the start of
the reaction (0.3 K) and increases over time due to reduced signal
toward ca. 22 K between 110 and 140 min.

Figure 2 Observed temperatures
over time determined by luminescence thermometry
at the top (red), middle (blue), and bottom (green) of a fixed bed
reactor.

Note that before the reaction
starts, the temperatures are different
at the top, middle and bottom of the reactor. This is most likely
due to the relatively cold (473 K) gases, which are introduced to
the fixed bed via the top. This phenomenon has also been observed
by Yarulina and co-workers.13

At
all three positions, we see a rapid increase of temperature
upon starting the reaction. The temperature at the top spikes first,
followed by a temperature maximum in the middle and afterward a temperature
maximum at the bottom of the reactor. At the conditions used, the
reaction is operating at 100% methanol conversion for 400 min, while
the temperature at the bottom of the reactor is at its maximum around
30 min.

In the recent work of Yarulina et al.,13 the gradual deactivation of the catalyst bed is aligned
with the
temperature maxima at different heights in the reactor bed. When the
regions in the reactor are nicely separated, the position, where methanol
is converted, moves down after deactivation of the top of the reactor.
A decrease in methanol conversion occurs when the deactivation front
reaches the bottom of the catalyst bed. However, in comparison to
the work of Yarulina et al., the results in Figure 2 were obtained with higher flow speeds and
a relatively short reactor bed. Therefore, in this case, the active
regions in the reactor bed are not separated and the temperature front
is not aligned with the deactivation of the reactor. The three successive
temperature maxima from top to bottom can be explained as a gradual
activation of the catalyst bed. After this gradual activation, indicated
by the three spikes in temperature that were shown in Figure 2, the temperature starts to
decrease over the whole reactor. The temperature decrease is the largest
for the bottom and middle of the reactor, while the top of the reactor
stays warmer for a longer period. After 140 min of reaction, the temperature
at all different points in the reactor is similar to the initial temperature
before the reaction.

During the reaction, the temperature of
the reactor is controlled
by a thermocouple inside the oven. One explanation for the decrease
after ca. 30 min is that the thermocouple feedback reduces the reactor
heater power output after the fast temperature increase due to the
exothermic reactions taking place. Because there is still more methanol
converted at the top of the reactor than at the rest of the reactor,
the top part cools down slower compared to the middle and bottom part
as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Temperature profiles of the reactor at t = 0 min
(a), t = 0–30 min (b), and t = 60–140 min (c).

From Figure 4, it
can be seen that during the reaction, the catalyst particles become
darker due to coke deposition. This effect starts at the top of the
reactor, and after the reaction, the catalyst is completely coked.
It is very interesting to see that the coke deposition only occurs
at the zeolite particles; the temperature probes are not affected
by the coke deposition and stay white, showing their inertness toward
reactive gases. Despite the fact that the coke deposition on the catalyst
particles absorbs the luminescence from the temperature probes, which
severely reduces the luminescence intensity during experiments, it
was still possible to measure sufficient luminescence output and calculate
temperatures inside the reactor.

Figure 4 Photographs of the reactor before (a),
during (t = 120 min, b), and after the reaction (t = 400
min, c).

The measured temperature front
which moves over the reactor is
consistent with literature and the observations of the coke deposition
during the reaction. This experiment shows the potential of luminescence
thermometry to measure the temperature in catalytic reactions with
a noninvasive probing technique.

Although the potential of luminescence
thermometry has been demonstrated
with these experiments, the microcrystalline temperature probes with
a final size of 150–425 μm may have limited applicability
in other experimental setups due to the size constraints. To ensure
the applicability of luminescence thermometry in a broader range of
catalytic systems, it is possible to prepare different temperature
probe particles that can be embedded in or placed on different support
materials, as shown in Figure 1.

Many different catalytic reactions exploit NP catalysts
to increase
the surface to volume ratio. In most cases, the catalyst NPs are supported
on an inorganic material to increase their mechanical and thermal
stability and to prevent activity loss of the catalyst due to sintering
of the NPs. A widely used support, Al2O3 is
shown in the SEM image in Figure 1b. In order to measure the temperature at the surface
of the support, it is possible to deposit NaYF4:Er,Yb@SiO2 core/shell NPs (zoom-in) and subsequently measure the temperature-dependent
luminescence (inset), which is similar to the temperature-dependent
luminescence observed in Figure 1a. The NPs used in these extrudates were prepared as
discussed in earlier work.15 To prevent
sintering of the NPs at elevated temperatures, the particles are coated
with a silica shell.25 This ensures thermal
stability up to at least 900 K.

For larger-scale reactors, using
bigger catalyst bodies, like extrudates,
is more suitable to prevent a pressure drop in the reactor bed. Figure 1c shows a photograph
of extrudates with NaYF4:Er,Yb@SiO2 core/shell
NPs incorporated that can be added to a reactor system to locally
measure the temperature in a larger reactor bed. These mm-sized extrudates
show green upconversion luminescence upon excitation with a 980 nm
laser source, which is temperature-dependent (inset) similar to the
luminescence shown in Figure 1a,b.

By expanding the system from the microcrystalline
NaYF4:Er,Yb in the showcase MTH reaction to NPs, which
can be incorporated
into supported systems or extrudates, the potential of luminescence
thermometry has been greatly increased. By combining the luminescence
thermometry with a confocal microscope with spectral output, the spatial
resolution can be enhanced to the submicrometer regime enabling to
investigate temperature heterogeneities at all different length scales.

In conclusion, using temperature-dependent luminescence of NaYF4:Er,Yb
crystallites, the temperature was probed over the course of a catalytic
reaction at different heights in a reactor bed. The obtained results
show a clear potential for luminescence thermometry for noninvasive
in situ temperature measurements. Using the luminescence output upon
excitation of the temperature probes inside a working reactor, the
temperatures were determined at three different heights. For the MTH
process, it was shown that the introduction of the methanol leads
to an increased temperature due to the exothermic nature of the MTH
reaction and revealed differences in the time-dependent temperature
profiles at different heights in the reactor.

By decreasing
the size of the temperature probes from micro- to
nanoparticles, it is possible to incorporate the temperature probes
in other catalyst particles, for example, extrudates or other type
of catalyst bodies, and therefore increase the range of catalytic
reactions that can be probed.

Until now, temperature heterogeneities
at the submicrometer level
are still poorly understood. By combining the temperature-dependent
luminescence with confocal microscopy, for example, it should be possible
to make temperature maps with spatial resolutions in the submicrometer
regime.
