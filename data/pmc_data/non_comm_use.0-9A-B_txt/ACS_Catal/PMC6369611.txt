Based on theoretical calculations
of CO, NH3, and pyridine
adsorption at different sites in MOR and MFI zeolites, we analyze
how confinement effects influence the measurement of acidity based
on the interaction of probe molecules with Brönsted acid sites.
Weak bases, such as CO, form neutral ZH–CO adducts with a linear
configuration that can be distorted by spatial restrictions associated
with the dimensions of the pore, leading to weaker interaction, but
can also be stabilized by dispersion forces if a tighter fitting with
the channel void is allowed. Strong bases such as NH3 and
pyridine are readily protonated on Brönsted acid sites, and
the experimentally determined adsorption enthalpies include not only
the thermochemistry associated with the proton transfer process itself,
but also the stabilization of the Z––BH+ ion pair formed upon protonation by multiple interactions
with the surrounding framework oxygen atoms, leading in some cases
to a heterogeneity of acidities within the same zeolite structure.

==== Body
Zeolites
are inorganic microporous
crystalline materials composed by SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra that link to form channels and cavities of molecular
dimensions. Their well-determined topology and microporous structure,
the associated high internal surface area, and their notable adsorption
and shape-selective properties, are important aspects influencing
their successful application as heterogeneous catalysts. Yet, the
key factor in most catalytic applications is the presence of single,
isolated, and well-defined active sites in the framework or in extra-framework
positions which can be visualized, most of the time, by means of different
physicochemical characterization techniques. Zeolites can be synthesized
with a variety of pore dimensions and compositions. It is possible
to introduce metal atoms in framework and extra-framework positions,
as well as metal or metal oxide clusters within their channels and
cavities. The substitution of tetrahedrally coordinated framework
Si atoms with a trivalent element such as Al introduces bridging hydroxyl
groups in the ordered structure of the solid. The presence of these
bridging hydroxyl groups, with their Brönsted acid characteristics,
have opened zeolites to a large number of academic and industrial
applications, and it it possible to say that, today, zeolites are
the most widely used solid acid catalysts in the industry.1−8 They are employed in large-scale commercial processes in the fields
of oil refining and the petrochemical industry, and they also find
application in the production of fine and specialty chemicals, or
in the conversion of methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-gasoline
(MTO and MTG processes, respectively). Moreover, their presence is
increasing in emerging fields related with the nonconventional transformation
of raw materials, such as the conversion of coal, gas, and oil into
syngas, olefins, acetylene and aromatics, the potential transformation
of alternative sources, such as biomass, and the valorization of methane
or CO2.9−13

Given that most industrial applications of zeolites are based
on
their Brönsted acid properties, it is not surprising that,
since their introduction as acid catalysts,14 a large effort has been done to characterize the number, strength,
and accessibility of the potentially active acid sites, and to correlate
these values with their catalytic activity. In addition to theoretical
studies,15−20 diverse experimental techniques such as calorimetric measurements,
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of basic molecules, 1H, 13C, and 17O solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), as well as infrared (IR) and Raman vibrational spectroscopies,
are employed to measure the acidity of zeolites.21−30 Despite the accuracy of the theoretical and the experimental data
obtained nowadays, and the deep understanding of zeolite acidity provided
by such techniques, many questions are still open related to the heterogeneity
of the Brönsted acid sites, either in different zeolites or
within the same zeolite structure. This heterogeneity is associated
with the location of the acid sites in pores, channels, and cavities
of different dimensions, with the protons pointing to different environments,
and should be taken into consideration when analyzing and comparing
the acidity determined by different techniques.

By definition,
a Brönsted acid is a species prone to donate
a proton, according to  Or, in the
presence of a base, a species able
to transfer a proton to such base, as described by  Following
the first definition, the intrinsic
strength of a Brönsted acid can be quantified by its deprotonation
energy EDEP, defined as the energy necessary
to separate a proton at an infinite distance from the resulting anion,  

However, in practice, Brönsted
acidity can only be observed
when a proton is transferred to a base, and, in this case, the feasibility
of the process is also dependent on the tendency to accept protons,
or proton affinity (PA), of the base,  and of the stabilization of the resulting
A––BH+ ion pair by electrostatic
and, depending on the system, other types of interactions. In solution,
the ionic species A– and BH+ are fully
surrounded by solvent molecules that provide a different degree of
stabilization, depending on their polarity, and the dielectric medium
decreases the Coulombic attraction between A– and
BH+, facilitating their separation.21,29

In zeolites, the Brönsted acid sites are the so-called
bridged
hydroxyl groups (Figure 1), formed by a proton directly attached to a framework oxygen atom
that is bonded to one Al and one Si atom. The three O–Al, O–Si,
and O–H bonds are covalent bonds superimposed by small electrostatic
interactions, and the O atom has therefore a formal 3-fold coordination
similar to that present in the hydronium cation H3O+. The preferred geometry of an O atom in such nonclassical
situation is not tetrahedral as in H3O+ cation,
but has a tendency to be almost planar with three nonequivalent X–O–X
bonds, where X = H, Al, and Si. The ordering imposed by the crystalline
structure of the zeolite limits the flexibility around this O atom,
thus weakening the OH bond and generating acidity. Deprotonation energies EDEP, taken as the most rigorous parameter describing
the intrinsic acid strength of a Brönsted acid, cannot be experimentally
determined, but they have been estimated from quantum-chemical calculations
using isolated clusters,31,32 embedded clusters,33−35 and periodic models.18,36 Deprotonation energies calculated
using small cluster models show important variations with cluster
size that have a tendency to converge for systems containing more
than 20 T atoms. This trend suggests that, at this cluster size, electrostatic
interactions already approach those present in real zeolites.32 Polarization of the Si–O bonds, which
has been shown to be essential to stabilize the negative charge generated
by deprotonation of the Brönsted acid centers, is also a quite
local effect that does not extend far beyond the second O atom coordination
sphere from the Al atom.18 In accordance
with this proposal and based on periodic DFT calculations, Grajciar
et al. reported that the acidity of Brönsted sites in FER is
mostly influenced by their local environment, in particular by the
number of Al atoms in the second coordination sphere of the acid site,
and not so much by the topology of the site.36 This finding is especially relevant for zeolites with high Al content,
and indirectly confirms the similar intrinsic acidity of all isolated
Brönsted sites present in high Si/Al ratio zeolites. When the
clusters treated with quantum chemical methods are embedded in a periodic
system described by interatomic potentials, that is, the QM-Pot approach,
the influence of cluster size is much smaller, and all calculated
DPE values for FAU and MFI structures remain within 3 and 6 kJ/mol,
respectively.37 Deprotonation energy values
calculated with the QM-Pot approach for various zeolites with different
crystalline structure (CHA, TON, FER, MFI, MOR, and FAU) are within
a range of <30 kJ/mol, indicating that the intrinsic acid strength
of zeolites is hardly influenced by the framework structure.34,37 This conclusion was confirmed by Jones et al. in an exhaustive and
accurate study of deprotonation energies of isolated Brönsted
acid sites in zeolites CHA, BEA, FER, MFI, MOR, and FAU. EDEP for the 12 distinct T sites in MFI range from 1655
kJ/mol to 1668 kJ/mol, and from 1622 kJ/mol to 1665 kJ/mol in MOR
(see all values in ref (18)). The statistical ensemble averages of EDEP values at each crystallographic position, which reflect the stability
of the conjugate anions, are insensitive to the location of the isolated
Al atoms, with calculated values of 1201 ± 11 kJ/mol.18

Therefore, the wide range of acid and catalytic properties
reported
for zeolite materials should be related to differences in the stabilization
of the protonated BH+ species by interaction with the negatively
charged Z– framework. The net negative charge in
the deprotonated zeolite is easily spread out over the O atoms up
to two coordination spheres from the Al center,18 and provides a diffuse electron cloud over the inner surface
of the zeolite microporous structure. This indicates that the zeolite
anion would be a soft conjugated base, highly adaptable to stabilize
soft cationic species confined within the pores.38 The extent of this stabilization by electrostatic and van
der Waals interactions is dependent on the number and strength of
contacts between the confined species and the surrounding framework
O atoms, that is, on how the size and shape of the guest species fits
with those of the zeolite host channels and cavities.19,39

The confinement concept was introduced by Derouane et al.,
to rationalize
some remarkable features of zeolites on the basis of the geometrical
curvature of their internal surface.40 In
contrast to the shape-selectivity effects, which modify the adsorption
and diffusion of reactants and products, or prevents the formation
of certain transition states, because of short-range repulsions between
the adsorbed molecules and the zeolite microporous structure, confinement
effects stem from long-range attractive van der Waals interactions.
When the sizes of the host structure and the guest molecule become
comparable, the adsorbed molecules and their direct framework environment
have a tendency to reciprocally optimize their van der Waals interaction,
leading to enhanced adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic properties.41 A first and simple model to quantify van der
Waals interactions in confined spaces considered dispersion forces
only, and was based on a dimensionless parameter s, which was defined as  where d is the distance between
the confined molecule and the micropore wall and a is the micropore radius. The magnification of dispersion interactions
in a curved environment, relative to a flat surface, was estimated
as being proportional to (1 – s/2)−3, and suggested that physisorption energies could be enhanced by
a factor of 8 in the situation of maximum confinement (s = 1), and by a factor of ∼3 in intermediate situations (0.5
< s < 1). Further improvement of this model
by including pore shape and repulsion effects led to a maximum magnification
of the physisorption energy by a factor of ∼5 in the optimal
tight fit situation.40,41

Many efforts have been
done since then to quantitatively evaluate
confinement effects in zeolites, considering not only the average
size of molecules and channels, but also molecular shape and local
framework geometry within the pores. Methods based on classical force
fields have been widely used to simulate molecular adsorption and
diffusion in zeolites, because of their computational efficiency and
accuracy.42 However, they are not suited
to describe chemical reactions involving bond breaking and formation,
and, therefore, quantum mechanical (QM) methods, despite being computationally
more expensive, have been applied to the study of reactivity in zeolites.
QM methods are applied to cluster models in which a portion of the
zeolite is taken into account, to hybrid schemes combining clusters
treated at QM level inserted in a periodic system described with force
fields, or to fully periodic systems.15,16,19 In the case of periodic calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT), one of the main challenges is the description
of the dispersion interactions, which are not taken into consideration
by local density functionals. Several approaches have emerged in recent
years to overcome this limitation, and encouraging results have been
reported, for instance, for the adsorption of alkanes in zeolites
using computationally accessible techniques.43−45 Among them,
the DFT-D methodology proposed by Grimme combines an excellent computational
efficiency with reasonable accuracy, with an average deviation from
experimental values of ∼5 kJ/mol.46,47

To illustrate the effect of confinement associated with the
curvature
of the zeolite microporous structure, four molecules of increasing
size and polarity—CO, CH4, NH3, and pyridine—have
been placed within the channels of pure siliceous models of mordenite
(MOR) and ZSM-5 (MFI), and their position optimized without restrictions
at the DFT level (see Figures 2 and 3). The channel system of MFI
is composed by interconnected straight and sinusoidal 10-ring (10R)
channels ∼5.0 Å in diameter, that intersect, forming larger
void spaces ∼7.0 Å in diameter, while MOR contains large
12R channels of ∼7.0 Å interconnected via small 8R side
pockets of ∼4.0 Å. Two initial positions were considered
for each molecule in each zeolite: in the 12R channels and 8R side
pockets in MOR, and in the 10R channels and at the channel intersections
in MFI.

The main contribution to the calculated
interaction energies corresponds
to dispersion forces (Eint D3 in Table 1), in agreement with
previous work.44 In general, along the
series of guest molecules and host zeolites, this term becomes larger
as the size of the molecule increases, CO < NH3 ≈
CH4 < Py, and as the diameter of the channel decreases,
MOR-12R < MFI-int < MFI-10R < MOR-8R, with the calculated
values ranging from −20 kJ/mol to −70 kJ/mol. Only for
NH3 in the side-pockets of MOR, the presence of some local
hydrogen bonding between the slightly positive H atoms and three close
O atoms in the ring, results in a comparable contribution of the pure
DFT and the D3 values to the calculated interaction energy. The orientation
of Py within the 12R channels of MOR results in a non-negligible difference
in dispersion effects of 6 kJ/mol favoring the perpendicular orientation.
In the narrower channels of MFI, however, Py moves slightly toward
the wider region at the intersection, so that the global confinement
in the two positions initially considered is similar, and larger than
in MOR. These stabilizing interactions, associated only to confinement
in curved environments, have been generally taken into consideration
to study adsorption of hydrocarbons in zeolites,48 and, more recently, have been included in reactivity studies.39 We analyze now how these confinement effects
influence the measurements of acidity based on interaction of probe
molecules with Brönsted acid sites.

The adsorption of probe molecules of weak basicity
such as N2, CO, ethene, propane, CH3CN, or methanol,
and
the measurement of the perturbation of the ν(OH) frequency by
formation of a ZH–B adduct between the Brönsted acid
site and the weak base, have been widely used to quantify acid strength
in zeolites.21,25,28 Upon formation of a weak hydrogen bond with a base such as CO, the
ν(OH) stretching frequency of different zeolites undergoes a
red shift of up to 400 cm–1, while the ν(CO)
vibrational frequency is blue-shifted by 30–40 cm–1, with the magnitude of the shifts being assumed to be proportional
to the acidity of the OH group and, therefore, to the strength of
the interaction.24,49,50

Indeed, accurate measurements of enthalpy changes associated
with
CO bonding to Brönsted acid sites in H–Y, H-ZSM-5, and
H-FER zeolites were found to correlate with the shift in the ν(OH)
frequency. However, the trend did not apply for H-MCM-22 and H-MCM-56
zeolites.51 Using surface science techniques
in a UHV environment, Boscoboinik et al. characterized the acidity
of a bidimensional zeolite model system consisting of a bilayer aluminosilicate
film supported on Ru(0001) surface. The red-shift in the ν(OH)
frequency induced by CO and ethene adsorption on the bridged hydroxyl
groups present in the 2D model was in the order of the most acidic
OH groups reported for zeolites, indicating that the aluminosilicate
film is more acidic than 3D zeolites. However, the calculated adsorption
energies were larger in the zeolite cavities than in the flat surface,
because of the larger contribution of dispersion interactions in the
curved surfaces of 3D zeolites.52,53 Therefore, it seems
that a number of factors can influence the measured shifts apart from
the intrinsic acidity of the Brönsted site, at least some of
them being associated with the confinement effect. In order to gain
a deeper insight into how the confinement effect associated with micropores
of different diameter affects the characterization of acidity by means
of CO adsorption, the interaction of CO with 10 Brönsted acid
sites located in the 12R channels and 8R pockets of MOR, and in the
10R channels and channels intersections of MFI, with the protons pointing
to different environments, has been investigated using the DFT-D3
approach.

There are four nonequivalent tetrahedral sites in
the MOR unit
cell, T1 in the 12R main channel, T2 and T4 at the intersection between
the 12R channel and the 8R side-pockets, and T3 inside the 8R pockets.
To cover different environments of the acid centers, an Al atom was
introduced at T1, T3, and T4 positions and, in each case, two different
Brönsted acid sites were generated by attaching a proton to
two out of the four different O atoms directly bonded to Al, labeled
Oa and Ob (Figure 4). Among the 12 nonequivalent tetrahedral
sites present in the orthorhombic structure of MFI, T4 and T10 are
located in the sinusoidal 10R channel, T8 and T11 are in the straight
10R channel, and the rest (T1, T2, T3, T5, T6, T7, T9, and T12) are
at the intersection between the sinusoidal and straight 10R channels.
We studied two different environments, one within the straight 10R
channels by placing an Al at T11 site, and another one at the wider
void at the channels intersection with Al located at T1. And again,
in each case, two possible orientations of the Brönsted acid
site were considered, depending on the oxygen atom, Oa or
Ob, to which the proton was attached (Figure 5). Interaction energies with
and without dispersion corrections are summarized in Table 2, together with the shifts in
the νOH vibrational frequencies obtained using the accurate
ω/r correlation method described by Nachtigall
et al.54

The optimized geometry of the adducts formed by interaction
of
CO with a Brönsted acid site is linear, with optimized ZH–CO
distances close to ∼2 Å, and with the CO molecule occupying
the void space to which the proton in the isolated site was pointing.
However, if the dimensions of the pore do not allow a linear configuration
or there are spatial restrictions forcing a hydrogen bond that is
too short/too long, the acid–base interaction is weaker and
the system is slightly destabilized. On the other hand, depending
on the architecture of the microporous system, some configurations
allow a tighter fitting of CO within the channel void, leading to
a larger stabilization by dispersion interactions. Both effects are
independent and can contribute to the final geometry and stability
of the system.

This is clearly observed, for example, when comparing
the adsorption
of CO at T3 and T4 sites in MOR. The geometry of the adduct formed
at T3–Oa site should be equivalent to that obtained
at T4–Oa site (Figures 4c and 4e), but the
proximity of other framework oxygen atoms belonging to the narrow
sinusoidal 8R channel restricts the free space available for CO, so
that the optimized H–CO distance, 1.82 Å, is the shortest
among all the computed values, and the DFT interaction energy is 10
kJ/mol lower than observed at T4–Oa. The local geometry
of the adducts formed at T3–Ob and T4–Ob sites in MOR seems similar (Figures 4d and 4f) but CO adsorption
at T3–Ob provokes a distortion of the dihedral angle
d(H–O–Al–O) from 13° to 69°, which
results in a low interaction energy at the DFT level, while on T4–Ob the d(H–O–Al–O) dihedral angle only
changes from 11° to 29°, because of the interaction with
CO. Counteracting this effect, we observe that, while in T3–Oa and T3–Ob, the CO molecule is closely surrounded
by the O atoms of the 8R, in T4–Oa and T4–Ob, it is placed at the center of the large 12R channel, which
results in differences in stabilization by dispersion forces of nearly
20 kJ/mol (Table 2).
Altogether, the total adsorption energies are larger at T3 than at
T4, which correlates with larger Δν(OH) frequency shifts
at T3. However, this trend is lost when T1 is included in the comparison.
The largest total interaction energy in MOR is obtained for T1–Ob site with CO crossing the main 12R channel, but the calculated
Δν(OH) shift in this position is the lowest, −278
cm–1. In contrast, for the environments considered
within MFI structure, both the Brönsted sites associated with
Al atoms placed at the 10R channels and those placed at the channels
intersections are able to form ZH–CO adducts with the proton
and CO oriented toward the void space at the intersections (Figure 5), without any geometrical
constraint associated with the presence of too close framework atoms.
The differences in the DFT and D3 contributions between sites are
lower than 10 kJ/mol, the total interaction energies are within 1
kJ/mol, and the shifts in the ν(OH) vibrational frequencies
are in a narrow range of 20 cm–1.

These results
show that there are several independent factors contributing
to the optimized geometry, ν(OH) frequency, and stability of
ZH–CO adsorption complexes, which explain the lack of correlation
between CO adsorption energies and induced Δν(OH) shifts
in some cases,51,53 and questions the use of these
shifts to evaluate the acid strength of zeolites and its influence
on reactivity.

In contrast to weak bases such as CO, strong
bases such as NH3 and pyridine are protonated by Brönsted
acid sites,
and the resulting cationic species, NH4+ and
pyridinium+ cations, interact strongly with the negatively
charged zeolite framework. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)
of NH3, Py, and other amines with different degrees of
substitution, is one of the most widely used methods for quantifying
Brönsted acidity in zeolites.1,21,29,55−57 It is based on an initial saturation of the catalyst surface with
chemisorbed NH3 or amine followed by a linear increase
in the temperature, with the amount of NH3 or amine desorbed
at different temperatures providing information about the concentration
and strength of the acid sites present. Adsorption enthalpies obtained
from TPD measurements include not only the thermochemistry associated
with the proton transfer process itself, but also the stabilization
of the Z––BH+ ion pair formed
upon protonation by multiple interactions with the surrounding framework
oxygen atoms. A simple thermochemical cycle was proposed by Gorte
and collaborators to understand the acidity of zeolites, as depicted
in Figure 6.29,55,58,59

Figure 6 Thermochemical
cycle for (a) acidity in zeolites and (b) correlation
between heats of adsorption (ΔHadsorption) and proton affinities (PA) of alkylamines in H-MOR (orange) and
H-ZSM-5 (blue). [Adapted from ref (59). Copyright 1996, American Chemical Society,

According to this scheme,
the experimentally measured heat of adsorption
(ΔHadsorption) of a strong base
B in a zeolite ZH includes the deprotonation energy of the zeolite
(EDEP), the proton affinity of the base
(PAB), and the specific stabilization of the Z–BH+ ion pair within the zeolite void where it is formed
(ΔHinteraction), or, in other words,
the confinement effect of a particular zeolite on a given molecule.
Since the deprotonation energies of all sites in all zeolites are
similar,18,34,37 the measured
adsorption enthalpies for one base in different zeolites are indicative
of the different confinement effects exerted by these zeolites on
this base. Thus, for instance, the larger experimental enthalpies
of adsorption of NH3 in H-MOR (160 kJ/mol), compared to
H-ZSM-5 (145 kJ/mol), indicate a larger ion-pair stabilization or
confinement effect in the voids of mordenite.59 On the other hand, the existence of a correlation between the heats
of adsorption and the proton affinities of a series of alkyl amines
in H-MOR and H-ZSM-5 (Figure 6b) suggests that confinement effects within a given zeolite
structure are similar, in principle, for a series of structurally
related bases. The negative deviation from the correlation found for
trimethylamine was attributed to the loss of one hydrogen bond with
the framework in (CH3)3NH+ cation,
compared to NH4+ or the other protonated primary
or secondary amines, while the higher-than-expected adsorption enthalpies
obtained for butylamine were explained on the basis of an enhanced
stabilization by dispersion interactions between the alkyl chain and
the pore walls.59 While these and similar
results reported for substituted pyridines provide a clear picture
of the role of confinement in stabilizing protonated bases in different
zeolite structures, they do not reflect the possibility of having
a heterogeneous distribution of Brönsted acid sites within
a particular zeolite associated with their location in voids of different
size. To add some information regarding this possibility, we have
now calculated the energetics of adsorption and protonation of NH3 and pyridine at different sites in MOR and MFI structures,
so that the role of confinement in different regions of the same zeolite
can be estimated and compared.

All Brönsted acid sites
in MOR and MFI structures are accessible
to NH3, which, upon interaction with a bridged hydroxyl
group, is spontaneously protonated, forming a Z––NH4+ ion pair. The interaction energies
calculated for the process Z–H + NH3 → Z––NH4+ at a pure DFT level
are significantly higher than those obtained for CO adsorption, reflecting
the much stronger interaction between charged species, while the contribution
of dispersion interactions included in the D3 term is, in this case,
less relevant. In all cases, NH4+ remains close
to the Al atom, forming two strong hydrogen bonds with the two most
accessible oxygen atoms directly attached to Al. The optimized H--O
distances in the ion-pair complexes in which NH4+ is occupying the free space in the straight 12R of MOR or 10R channels
in MFI are quite similar (∼1.65 and ∼1.71 Å; see Figures 7a, 7c, and 7e). However, the presence of
other close O atoms in the pockets of MOR or at the channels intersection
in MFI readily distort this geometry. Thus, when NH3 is
protonated at T3 inside the MOR pockets, the NH4+ cation is stabilized by one short bond with the oxygen attached
to Al and by three weaker hydrogen bonds with the framework O atoms
of the 8R (Figure 7b). Moreover, the contribution of dispersion forces in this position
is larger than in the main channel, and, altogether, the calculated
interaction energy at T3 is the largest of all values in Table 3. A similar conformation
was explored at T4, with NH3 initially placed within the
8R; however, in this case, only one extra hydrogen bond was formed
to stabilize NH4+ (Figure 7d). Finally, the relative orientation of
the four oxygen atoms directly bonded to Al in the T1 site in MFI
(Figure 7e) does not
allow the formation of a clear bidentate complex, and, consequently,
the adsorption energy of NH3 at the channels intersection
in MFI is 20 kJ/mol weaker than within the channels. The average of
the calculated values for NH3 chemisorption in MFI are
in very good agreement with the experimental data obtained by Lee
et al. (145 kJ/mol),59 who also reported
a higher value for the adsorption energy of NH3 in MOR,
160 kJ/mol. In this case, the measured data agrees with the adsorption
energy calculated at the most stable site in MOR, inside the 8R pockets,
but does not reflect the heterogeneity of sites in MOR regarding the
stabilization of the Z––NH4+ ion-pair.

The protonation of pyridine,
according to Z–H + Py →
Z––Py+ generates a planar pyridinium
cation that can only form monodentate adducts with one of the O atoms
directly bonded to Al and that, because of the different size and
bonding geometry, compared to NH3, has a tendency to occupy,
in all cases, the void spaces in the large 12R channels in MOR or
at the channels intersections in MFI (Figure 8). Thus, while neutral Py adsorbed parallel
to the channels axis in pure siliceous models of MOR and MFI (Figures 2 and 3), once it is protonated, stronger hydrogen bonds between
the five H atoms attached to C and framework oxygen atoms are formed,
which change the orientation of the molecule to maximize such hydrogen
bond interactions. As a consequence, only adducts with a Py+ cation perpendicular to the 12R channel axis in MOR and occupying
the space at the channels intersections in MFI are obtained. In this
situation, both the electrostatic interactions correctly reproduced
at the DFT level and the dispersion contributions included in the
D3 term are comparable in all adducts (Table 3). The total interaction energies are independent
of the zeolite framework and location of Al, and are in excellent
agreement with the experimental values reported for pyridine adsorption
in H-ZSM-5 and H-MOR, 200 kJ/mol.59

of Pyridinium cation formed by protonation
of pyridine by Brönsted acid sites placed in the main channel
of (a, b) MOR and in the (c) straight channel and (d) channels intersection
of MFI zeolites,.

In summary, while it
is accepted today that the intrinsic acidity
of bridged hydroxyl groups in high Si/Al ratio zeolites determined
by their deprotonation energy is independent of zeolite structure
or site location within the framework, a more complex situation is
found when acidity is measured by means of adsorption of probe molecules.
Weak bases interacting with Brönsted acid sites form neutral
ZH–B adducts whose preferred geometry can be distorted by spatial
restrictions associated with the pore dimensions and to the relative
orientation of the adduct within the microporous structure. On the
other hand, and depending on the location of the Brönsted acid
sites within the microporous system, i.e. in channels, cavities or
pockets, a larger stabilization by dispersion forces can be obtained
when there is a tight fitting of the probe molecule with the confining
void. Strong bases interacting with Brönsted acid sites become
protonated, and the adsorption enthalpies obtained with calorimetric
or TPD techniques go beyond the thermochemistry of the proton transfer
process and, therefore, beyond the measurement of “acidity”,
because they also include the stabilization of the Z––BH+ ion pair formed upon protonation by multiple
interactions with the surrounding framework O atoms. Therefore, unless
all these factors are uncoupled, the conventional methods based on
adsorption of probe molecules cannot determine the intrinsic acidity
of the acid sites of zeolites. Nevertheless, since different probe
molecules form adducts whose size, geometry, and location within the
confining voids results in different destabilizing constraints and
stabilizing dispersion interactions, the use of series of probe molecules
can still be informative. Indeed, by combining theoretical results
as exemplified here with adequate adsorption experiments, it should
be possible, with a structurally known zeolite, to determine the degree
of heterogeneity of the acid sites present, depending on the synthesis
or post-synthesis conditions. Finally, if the zeolite is to be applied
in a particular reaction, the combination of the theoretical work
outlined before with adsorption and kinetic studies should give information
about the acid sites interacting, their geometries and energetic implications,
and where to locate the acid sites within the zeolite structure to
maximize activity and selectivity.

Computational Details
All calculations are based on periodic density functional theory
(DFT) and were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange-correlation functional within the generalized gradient
approach (GGA),60,61 as implemented in the Vienna
Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.62 The valence density was expanded in a plane wave basis set with
a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV, and the effect of the core electrons
in the valence density was taken into account by means of the projected
augmented wave (PAW) formalism.63 Integration
in the reciprocal space was carried out at the Γ k-point of the Brillouin zone. During geometry minimizations, the
positions of all atoms in the systems were fully relaxed without any
restriction. Dispersion corrections to the energies were evaluated
using the D3 Grimme’s method.46,47
