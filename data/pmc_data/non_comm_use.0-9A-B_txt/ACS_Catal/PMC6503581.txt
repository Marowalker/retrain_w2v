Isomerization is a fundamental reaction
in chemistry. However,
isomerization of phenyl methyl ethers has not been described yet.
Using a cobalamin-dependent methyl transferase, a reversible shuttle
concept was investigated for isomerization of catechol monomethyl
ethers. The methyl ether of substituted catechol derivatives was successfully
transferred onto the adjacent hydroxy moiety. For instance, the cobalamin-dependent
biocatalyst transformed isovanillin to its regioisomer vanillin with
significant regioisomeric excess (68% vanillin). To the best of our
knowledge, isomerization by methyl transfer employing a methyl transferase
has not been reported before.

Introduction
Isomerization
reactions are fundamental transformations in both
a biological as well as a chemical sense, in which a substrate undergoes
intramolecular rearrangement of bonds or functional groups resulting
in a structurally varied product without changing its molecular formula,
and thus, it can be considered a constitutional isomer.1−5 While established synthetic methods involving such interconversions
mainly deal with allylic rearrangements catalyzed by metal catalysts,6−9 nature offers a vast source of enzyme-catalyzed transformations10−13 including isomerizations14−20 which have already emerged as an attractive alternative for many
requests.21−23 Various isomerization reactions in nature are enabled
by cobalamin cofactors,24−26 which belong to the most complex
organometallic molecules found in nature and offer remarkable options
for catalysis. They all share the structural motif of a corrin skeleton
with a cobalt–carbon bond in the center, being key to their
unique reactivity.27 Cobalamin-dependent
enzymes predominantly depend on the cofactor with the Co atom bound
either to a methyl moiety (Me-Cbl) or to 5′-deoxyadenosine
(Ado-Cbl), and accordingly, they perform different reactions (Scheme 1b).28,29 Ado-Cbl-dependent enzymes involve homolytic cleavage of the Co–C
bond and mainly catalyze isomerization reactions via a radical rearrangement
mechanism.15

Cofactors with the Unique Co–C Bond in

According to the Type of α Ligand Present at the Co Atom
In contrast, the reactivity
of Me-Cbl-dependent enzymes relies
on heterolytic cleavage of the organometallic Co–C bond, allowing
for methyl group transfer via nucleophilic substitution (Scheme 1B). Members of this
enzyme class are methyl transferases (MTases),30−32 which play
an important role both in eukaryotes for amino acid metabolism as
well as in anaerobes where they are involved in one-carbon metabolism
and CO2-fixation. As part of a complex multienzymatic system,
they catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from a donor molecule
to a methyl acceptor via two half reactions. This “ping-pong”
reaction cycle has been applied in a biocatalytic shuttle catalysis
concept33 for reversible demethylation
and methylation, representing a sustainable alternative to chemistry.34−36 The cobalamin-dependent methyl transfer machinery originating from
the anaerobic organism Desulfito-bacterium hafniense(37−39) was used for a simplified in vitro approach, consisting of one MTase
as the only biocatalyst and a corrinoid protein (CP) transporting
the cobalamin cofactor and acting as methyl group shuttle. In contrast
to the use of SAM-dependent methyltransferases,40−43 the presented approach allows
methylation as well as demethylation devoid of cofactor recycling
issues.42 Initial options have already
been demonstrated for the formation as well as cleavage of various
phenyl methyl ethers.

In the present study, we report an apparent
intramolecular methyl
group transfer resulting in constitutional substrate isomerization
employing the cobalamin-dependent MTase from D. hafniense. The apparent intramolecular migration of methyl groups has been
hardly investigated despite its important role in organic synthesis
involving homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.44−48 To the best of our knowledge, Me-Cbl-dependent enzymes
have never been described before to catalyze an isomerization reaction;
these reactions are usually encountered in the repertoire of their
Ado-Cbl-dependent analogue.

Results and Discussion
The MTase
from D. hafniense has been reported
to break heterolytically the methyl-O-ether bond
in a substrate such as guaiacol and transfer the methyl group onto
an acceptor molecule such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid.33 Because of the structural similarity of the
methyl donor and acceptor substrate containing a catechol backbone,
the possibility of an intramolecular methyl transfer seemed feasible.
Thus, the transfer of a methyl group attached to one hydroxy group
in substituted guaicol derivatives 1a–d to the other hydroxy moiety was investigated resulting in the formation
of the constitutional isomer (Scheme 2, meta and para refer
to the position of the introduced methyl group in relation to the
additional substituent at the catechol core). Formally, the demethylated
intermediate 2a–d has to be formed.

Scheme 2 Concept of Apparent Intramolecular Methyl Transfer Catalyzed by the
Corrinoid-Dependent MTase from D. hafniense Resulting
in Constitutional Isomerization
For a first approach to a formal intramolecular migration
of the
methyl group the demethylation of equimolar mixtures of vanillic/isovanillic
acid 1a (meta/para =
50/50) as well as vanillin/isovanillin 1b was investigated
(Table 1). As methyl
acceptor, the demethylated counterparts of the substrates (2a and 2b, respectively) were employed in excess (5 equiv)
to ensure a sufficiently fast reaction. Indeed, the equimolar m/p mixture of substrate 1a employed at the beginning of the biotransformation turned into a
surplus of the meta-isomer over time, ending up with
an m/p ratio of 65/35 after 48 h
(Table 1, entry 1).
An even more significant and also faster change of the m/p ratio was observed with the regioisomeric mixture
of 1b, ending up with 70% of vanillin m-1b already after 24 h, which did not change anymore
even after a prolonged incubation time. Interestingly, both final
isomer ratios corresponded to the regioselectivities obtained in case
of a performed methylation of compounds 2a–b. From these results, it can be deduced that methylation
of the substrates investigated takes place preferentially at the hydroxy
group in meta-position, whereas the para-methoxy group is preferred to be demethylated. No change of the m/p ratio was observed in the absence of
enzyme (Table 1, entry
2 and 4).

CFE, 40 mg/mL), CP (reconstituted holo-CP solution,
400 μL/mL, 67 mg/mL freeze-dried CFE), activation system (4.19
mM TiIII citrate and 0.3 mM methyl viologen) in MOPS buffer
(50 mM, 150 mM KCl, pH 6.5,) at 30 °C, 800 rpm in an Eppendorf
Orbital Shaker (1.5 mL) in an inert atmosphere.

b In the absence of enzyme.

c After indicated incubation time
product ratios were determined by HPLC-UV from areas of m-1a and p-1a and m-1b and p-1b, respectively, using calibration curves. The sum of concentrations
of all species corresponded to the initial amount

In a next step, the isomerization
of substrate 1b was
investigated in more detail using only catalytic amounts of the intermediate
methyl acceptor 2b (1 mM) (Table 2). Besides starting from an equimolar as
well as a 73/27 mixture of m- and p-1b, each single isomer was subjected to intramolecular
methyl transfer reactions as well. It has to be noted that when a
crude enzyme preparation of MTase and CP (cell-free extract) was used
with substrate 1b, reduction of the aldehyde moiety of 1b to the corresponding alcohol was observed catalyzed by
the E. coli background (see supporting Table S1). In order to circumvent this unwanted side reaction,
experiments were performed with purified enzymes instead. The presence
of just catalytic amounts of 2b proved to be sufficient
to facilitate formal constitutional isomerization, resulting in comparable
ratios as observed before when an excess of acceptor was employed.
After an extended reaction time of 7 days, isomerization seemed to
reach an equilibrium at an isomer ratio of about 3:1 (m/p = 75/25). This became especially evident in the
case where the 73/27 ratio was used as the starting point; in this
case, the ratio remained at a comparable level throughout the reaction
course (Table 2, entry
2). Isomerization was observed best for the para-isomer p-1b which was isomerized to 68% of the meta-isomer m-1b over time,
whereas isomerization of pure m-1b was
significantly slower, reaching a final ratio of m/p = 85/15. These results and the fact that no isomerization
at all occurred in the absence of enzyme (supporting Table S2) unambiguously confirmed an apparent intramolecular
methyl transfer catalyzed by the corrinoid-dependent MTase system
from D. hafniense.

μL/mL reconstituted solution, 22 mg/mL freeze-dried pure enzyme),
activation system (4.19 mM TiIII citrate and 0.3 mM methyl
viologen) in MOPS buffer (50 mM, 150 mM KCl, pH 6.5) at 30 °C,
800 rpm in an Eppendorf Orbital Shaker (1.5 mL) in an inert atmosphere.

b Product ratios were determined
after
indicated time points by HPLC-UV from areas of m-1c and p-1c using calibration
curves. The sum of concentrations of all species corresponded to the
initial amount.

Interestingly,
the benzyl alcohol 1c obtained by reduction
of 1b during isomerization with crude enzyme was present
as an equimolar mixture of isomers (meta/para = 48/52), independent of the kind of aldehyde substrate
employed (m-1b or p-1b, see supporting Table S1). In order to shed light onto the possible isomerization of 1c as well as on the isomerization during aldehyde reduction,
all isomers of substrates 1b–c were
subjected individually and in the absence of any methyl acceptor to
corrinoid-dependent isomerization using crude enzyme preparations
(Figure 1). Interestingly,
both alcohol isomers m-1c and p-1c were interconverted leading approximately
to a 1:1 mixture in the absence of any methyl acceptor present using
a crude enzyme preparation. However, when performing the same reaction
with purified enzymes, isomerization occurred only very slowly for m-1b and m-1c (1–3%, supporting Table S3, entry
1–4). Slightly higher amounts of the corresponding regioisomer
were formed in the case of the para-methoxy substrates p-1b and p-1c (9% and 3%, respectively). Although isomerization can be envisioned
without any methyl acceptor added according to Scheme 2, a faster isomerization was observed in
the presence of a crude enzyme preparation.

Figure 1 Relative amounts of 1b-c during isomerization
with CFE preparations of MTase I and CP in the absence of an acceptor
molecule. Reaction conditions: substrate (10 mM), MTase I (freeze-dried
CFE, 40 mg/mL), CP (400 μL/mL reconstituted solution, 67 mg/mL
CFE) in MOPS/KOH buffer (50 mM, 150 mM KCl, pH 6.5) at 800 rpm, 30
°C for 24 h. Product ratios were determined via HPLC using calibration
curves. The sum of concentrations of all species corresponded to the
initial amount.

As further substrates
the bis-methyl donors 2,3- and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
(2,3-1d and 2,6-1d) were investigated, being
also constitutional isomers. Theoretically, in either case, both methyl
groups are accessible for transfer onto an acceptor molecule. However,
MTase I preferentially catalyzes the demethylation of a methoxy group
in ortho-position to a hydroxy group. Since 2,3-1d exhibits only a single methoxy group matching this pattern,
a stepwise demethylation was anticipated being different from the
demethylation route involving 2,6-1d as substrate, where
both methoxy groups are in ortho-position to a hydroxy
group. Indeed, following as an initial experiment, the demethylation
of 2,3-1d over time with an excess of acceptor 2b (Figure 2a) showed that at first the methyl group next to the hydroxy function
is cleaved, resulting in the accumulation of 3-methoxycatechol 3-2d. Displaying now the beneficial ortho-OH
pattern, 3-2d is able to donate the last methyl group
efficiently as well, ending up in pyrogallol 3d. A demethylation
in 3-position of 2,3-1d, which would result in 2-methoxyresorcinol
2-2d, was not observed at all. Interestingly, with proceeding
reaction also the formation of the regioisomeric 2,6-1d (3%) became evident, suggesting an apparent intramolecular methyl
transfer resulting in isomerization. Similarly, also in the case of
the demethylation of 2,6-1d (Figure 2b) minor amounts of the respective isomer
were formed after 48 h.

Figure 2 Stepwise methyl transfer in the (a) demethylation
of bis-methyl
donor 2,3-1d and (b) demethylation of 2,6-1d using 2b as methyl acceptor. Reaction conditions: substrate 1d (10 mM, 1.5 mg/mL), methyl acceptor 2b (50
mM, 6.9 mg/mL), MTase I (40 mg/mL freeze-dried CFE), CP (400 μL/mL
reconstituted holo-CP solution, 67 mg/mL freeze-dried CFE), activation
system (0.3 mM methyl viologen and 4.19 mM TiIII citrate)
in MOPS buffer (50 mM, 150 mM KCl, pH 6.5) at 30 °C, 800 rpm
in an Eppendorf Orbital Shaker (1.5 mL) in an inert atmosphere. Conversions
of substrates and relative product amounts were determined after indicated
time points by HPLC-UV from areas of 1d, 2d, and 3d using calibration curves.

Furthermore, the demethylation experiment indicates that
the methyl
group is transferred from the substrate onto the cobalamin cofactor
followed by dissociation of the substrate from the enzyme, which enables
another substrate molecule to bind again and take the methyl group.
This dissociation and transfer to another molecule has previously
been exploited for trans-methylation.33 Isomer 2,6-1d possesses two equal methyl groups in ortho-position to a hydroxy moiety, which are both available
for methyl transfer leading to the formation 3-2d in
either case. Upon accumulation, 3-2d also served as a
methyl donor and was converted to 3d. Nevertheless, small
amounts of the other regiosiomer 2,3-1d produced indicated
an internal methyl transfer via 3-2d. Presumably, the
present excess of methyl acceptor 2b pushed the reaction
equilibrium toward the second demethylation.

Indeed, subjecting
both dimethoxyphenols 2,3-1d and
2,6-1d to corrinoid-dependent methyl transfer in the
absence of a methyl acceptor using cell-free extracts clearly demonstrated
isomerization (Figure 3). Formation of 3-2d (e.g., 8–10% after 24 h)
was observed for both substrates 2,3- and 2,6-1d, whereby
3-2d represents the demethylated intermediate required
for the interconversion of isomers. It is worthwhile to note that
in this isomerization experiment neither the formation of the 2-fold
demethylated product 3d nor formation of 2-methoxyresorcinol
2-2d was observed. When the experiment was performed
with purified enzymes only, no formation of 3-2d was
observed, and isomerization was significantly decelerated (supporting Table S4). In the experiment with
CFE, a final product ratio of 3-2d/2,3-1d/2,6-1d = 15/20/65 was obtained independent from the
substrate used (2,3-1d or 2,6-1d), suggesting
an equilibrium between the regioisomers.

2,3-1d (open symbols) and
2,6-1d (filled symbols) in the absence of a methyl acceptor
over time. 100% corresponds to the sum of 2,6-1d, 2,3-1d, and 3-2d. Reactions conditions: substrate 1d (10 mM, 1.5 mg/mL), MTase I (40 mg/mL freeze-dried CFE),
CP (400 μL/mL reconstituted holo-CP solution, 67 mg/mL freeze-dried
CFE), activation system (4.19 mM TiIII citrate and 0.3
mM methyl viologen) in MOPS buffer (50 mM, 150 mM KCl, pH 6.5) at
30 °C, 800 rpm in an Eppendorf Orbital Shaker (1.5 mL) in an
inert atmosphere. Relative amounts were determined after indicated
time points by HPLC-UV from respective areas using calibration curves.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates
the constitutional isomerization of catechol
methyl ethers via an apparent intramolecular methyl transfer employing
cobalamin-dependent methyl transferases. In contrast to radical-based
reactions for rearrangements, which have been reported for a different
class of cobalamin-dependent enzymes, apparent intramolecular transmethylation
is described here which occurs via nucleophilic reactions involving
the CoI cobalamin species as supernucleophile. Substrates
sharing the structural motif of a catechol core, involving both protocatechuate
derivatives as well as dimethoxyphenols were successfully isomerized
to the corresponding regioisomers. To the best of our knowledge, isomerization
by methyl transfer has never been reported for other methyl transferases
before, making cobalamin-dependent MTases especially valuable and
promising enzymes for further research in the field of biocatalysis
allowing to extend the toolbox49−51 of biocatalytic reactions.

Experimental
Section
General Remarks
All chemicals and solvents were obtained
from commercial sources (VWR International/Merck, Roth, Sigma-Aldrich/Fluka)
and used as obtained unless stated otherwise. Biocatalysts were produced
in E. coli as described before33 and used as frieze-dried cell free extracts (CFE). Alternatively,
enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography (Strep-Tactin technology,
IBA Lifesciences) according to the manual provided by the supplier
and used as freeze-dried pure preparation. Due to the oxygen-sensitivity
displayed by the corrinoid cofactor, biocatalytic reactions were performed
in degassed buffers under inert atmosphere (N2 5.0) in a MBraun LABstar
glovebox, which was equipped with a MB-OX-EC O2-sensor
and an Eppendorf Thermomixer comfort. For detailed analytical methods
see electronic Supporting Information.

General Procedure for Preparation of holo-CP
Since the heterologous E. coli host used for recombinant
enzyme production does not synthesize methylcobalamin,52 the CP was reconstituted with exogenous cofactor
under inert atmosphere. A reconstitution buffer was prepared by dissolving
methyl cobalamin (2 mM) in the presence of DTT (2 mM) and betaine
(3 M) in TRIS/HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT). Then,
freeze-dried CP (100 mg/mL CFE or 33 mg/mL purified enzyme, respectively)
was added to the reconstitution buffer (1 mL) and incubated for 2
h at 4 °C. Then, unbound cobalamin and salts were removed using
a PD MidiTrap G-25 column (GE Healthcare), and holo-CP was eluted with MOPS/KOH buffer (100 mM, 150 mM KCl, pH 6.5).
Successful in vitro reconstitution was verified by the bright red
color of obtained protein fraction based on the characteristic absorbance
of the CoIII in methyl cobalamin. The CP-solution (containing
22 mg/mL pure enzyme or 66.7 mg/mL CFE, respectively) was stored at
4 °C until further use.

General Procedure for Analytical Biotransformation
Biotransformations were carried out at least in triplicates in
1.5
mL Eppendorf tubes on 180 μL scale as follows: freeze-dried
MTase I (40 mg/mL CFE or 13 mg/mL pure enzyme, respectively) was rehydrated
in holo-CP solution (400 μL/mL). Then, appropriate
amounts of substrate (final concentration 10 mM) and methyl acceptor
(as indicated) were added as stock solutions in MOPS/KOH buffer (50
mM, pH 6.5, 150 mM KCl). If not indicated otherwise, a chemical activation
system consisting of methyl viologen (0.3 mM) and TiIII chloride (4.15 mM) was added for reducing undesired CoII. The latter one was added as a stock solution in MOPS/KOH (1 M,
333 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.9). Reaction samples were shaken at 800
rpm and 30 °C for 24 h. The MTase system employed as described
above (involving MTase I and CP) displayed an activity in the range
10–20 mU. Initial rates were determined as described before33 and enzyme activity (mU) was defined as the
amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 nanomole of substrate
per minute.

Determination of Conversion
After
the indicated reaction
time, an aliquot (30 μL) was withdrawn, quenched by adding MeCN
(180 μL), incubated (room temperature, 30 min), and diluted
with deionized water (90 μL). Denatured protein was removed
by centrifugation (14 000 rpm, 15 min), the supernatant was
filtered and analyzed by HLPC (Agilent 1260 Infinity system, UV detector)
using an achiral C18 column (Phenomenex, Luna, C18 100c, 250 ×
4.6 mm, 5 mm). Eluent: H2O/MeCN (containing 0.1% TFA),
flow rate: 1 mL/min. Compounds were detected by UV-absorption, and
conversions were calculated according to calibrations curves.
