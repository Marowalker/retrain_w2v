Peroxygenases
require a controlled supply of H2O2 to operate
efficiently. Here, we propose a photocatalytic
system for the reductive activation of ambient O2 to produce
H2O2 which uses the energy provided by visible
light more efficiently based on the combination of wavelength-complementary
photosensitizers. This approach was coupled to an enzymatic system
to make formate available as a sacrificial electron donor. The scope
and current limitations of this approach are reported and discussed.

==== Body
Peroxygenases are receiving
tremendous interest as catalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization
reactions.1−3 Compared to the well-known P450 monooxygenases, peroxygenases
exhibit a comparable reactivity pattern as both rely on an oxyferryl
species (Compound I) as catalytically active compound. To generate
Compound I, P450 monooxygenases rely on complicated electron transport
chains while peroxygenases require only hydrogen peroxide.

Nevertheless,
peroxygenases are rapidly inactivated in the presence
of even small concentrations of H2O2. The peroxygenase
from Caldariomyces fumago, for example, exhibits
a half-life time of 38 min in the presence of 50 μM H2O2.4 Therefore, careful control
of the in situ H2O2 concentration is required.
Slow addition of H2O2 is possible but results
in significant dilution of the reaction mixtures. More elegantly,
H2O2 is generated within the reaction mixture
through reduction of ambient molecular oxygen. For example, enzymatic
H2O2 generation systems have been developed.5−8 More recently, also electrochemical4,9−12 and photocatalytic alternatives have moved into the focus.13−18 The latter bear the promise of utilizing sunlight as a thermodynamic
driving force to promote selective oxyfunctionalization reactions.
Today, however, these systems suffer from some major drawbacks such
as formation of large (and toxicologically and environmentally questionable)
amounts of waste (Table S4)16−18 or sluggish reaction kinetics.13,14 Also, so far,
only flavin- or TiO2-based photocatalysts have been used,
limiting the wavelength range to the near UV and blue light (450 nm).
Hence, only a fraction of wavelengths is used, leaving a significant
amount of sunlight energy unexploited.

In this study, we aimed
at addressing both issues and provide the
proof-of-concept for more efficient photocatalytic oxyfunctionalization
reactions. We envisioned using simple formate as a sacrificial electron
donor, producing CO2 as stoichiometric byproduct. Furthermore,
by employing several, wavelength-complementary photocatalysts we aimed
at providing a more efficient use of the energy of polychromatic light.

To couple formate oxidation to photocatalytic H2O2 generation, we envisioned an enzymatic relay system comprising
formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (CbFDH) to mediate the hydride transfer from formate to NAD+.19 The resulting NADH has previously
been shown to be prone to photocatalytic, aerobic oxidation yielding
H2O2 (Scheme 1).20−22 The peroxygenase used
in this study was the recombinant, evolved peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO).23,24

Scheme 1 Proposed Photoenzymatic System for in Situ Generation of H2O2 To Promote Peroxygenase-Catalyzed Hydroxylation Reactions
First, we screened 23 commercially
available dyes for their capability
of oxidizing NADH and delivering the reducing equivalents to O2 to yield H2O2 (Table S1). Out of these, 17 were discarded either because
they did not oxidize NADH or because their reduced form was stable
in the presence of O2 and therefore unsuitable for the
aim of this study.

The remaining candidates (all acridine derivatives)
were investigated
further with respect to their activity in photochemical NADH oxidation
and H2O2 generation. The catalytic performance
(expressed as turnover frequency, TF) of the photocatalysts is shown
in Table 1.

c TF = turnover frequency of the catalyst
= (H2O2 formation rate) [mM h–1]/(concentration of the photocatalyst) [mM].

Drawing correlations between the physicochemical and
structural
properties of the photocatalysts and their activity (Table 1) is difficult as factors such
as redox potential, photoexcitability, and reactivity of the reduced
form with O2 contribute to the macroscopically observed
H2O2 generation rate. Future work will aim at
an in-depth understanding of the influence of the substitution pattern
on aspects such as reactivity and stability of the photocatalysts.

Even though all photocatalysts mentioned in Table 1 were suitable to promote the rAaeUPO-catalyzed hydroxylation reaction, we focused on phenosafranine,
methylene blue, and FMN, because this combination offers a broad coverage
of the visible light spectrum (Figure 1). Additionally, as permanent ions, these photocatalysts
ensure high and pH-independent solubility in the aqueous reaction
mixture.

Figure 1 Coverage of the visible light spectrum by combining flavin mononucleotide
(orange), phenosafranine (green), and methylene blue (red).

Using these photocatalysts, either
individually or in combination,
together with the CbFDH/NAD/HCO2H system
generated H2O2 to promote the rAaeUPO-catalyzed stereospecific hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to (R)-1-phenylethanol (Figure 2).

or 10 μM methylene blue + 5 μM phenosafranine + 5 μM
FMN (□) as photocatalysts. Conditions: c(rAaeUPO) = 100 nM, c(CbFDH) = 4.8 μM, c(NAD+) = 0.4 mM, c(NaHCO2) = 75 mM, c(ethylbenzene)
= 10 mM, 50 mM KPi buffer (pH 7, 0.8% MeOH (v/v)), T = 30 °C, λ = 450, 520, and 630 nm (blue, green, and red
LED light). Please note: using a broadspectrum (sunlight-imitating)
light source (Lightincure LC8 L9566, Hamamatsu) gave comparable results
(Figure S9).

In the absence of either photocatalyst or rAaeUPO, no product formation was observed. The same is true for experiments
performed in the darkness with the exception of methylene blue where
upon prolonged reaction times some product traces were found (0.4
mM after 48 h). This is in line with previous observations that methylene
blue is capable of a “dark-reaction” with NADH.21,25 Some product formation (approximately 5–20% of the “normal”
product formation rate) was observed in the absence of either component
of the NADH regeneration system (i.e., in the absence of formate, CbFDH, or NAD+). The latter observation most
likely can be attributed to an undesired reductive quenching of the
excited photocatalysts by oxidizable components in the reaction mixture
(i.e., proteins, amino acids, etc.; see also Tables S2 and S3).26 It is worth mentioning
that the optical purity of the product always exceeded 95% enantiomeric
excess (ee).

The relative rates observed with
the individual photocatalysts
qualitatively corresponded to the photocatalytic H2O2 generation rates shown in Table 1. Noteworthy, when using a combination of
the single photocatalysts, the product formation rate was approximately
the sum of the previously observed individual rates (Figure 2). The turnover numbers calculated
for the catalytic components (rAaeUPO, photocatalysts,
NAD, and CbFDH) were 100 000, 500, 25, and
1785, respectively.

Next, we further examined the influence
of different reaction parameters
on the rate of the photoenzymatic hydroxylation reaction in more detail
(Figure 3). Quite expectedly,
the concentration of the photocatalysts directly influenced the rate
of the overall system (Figure 3A). While this correlation was linear with methylene blue
over the entire concentration range investigated, a saturation-type
behavior was observed with phenosafranine and FMN, which most likely
can be attributed to the decreasing optical transparency of the reaction
mixture at elevated concentrations of the latter photocatalysts. The
overall reaction rate also directly correlated with the intensity
of the light source (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 Influence of different reaction parameters on the product formation
rate of the photoenzymatic hydroxylation of ethylbenzene. (A) Concentration
of the photocatalyst (red ■: methylene blue; green ⧫:
phenosafranine; orange ▲: FMN); (B) intensity of broadband
light source (c(rAaeUPO) = 100 nM, c(CbFDH) = 4.8 μM, c(NAD+) = 0.4 mM); concentration
of rAaeUPO (C), CbFDH (D), or NAD+ (E). Conditions (unless indicated otherwise): c(rAaeUPO) = 50 nM, c(CbFDH) = 2.4 μM,
c(NAD+) = 0.2 mM, c(NaHCO2) = 75 mM, c(ethylbenzene)
= 10 mM, 50 mM KPi buffer (pH 7, 0.8% MeOH (v/v)), T = 30 °C.

Varying the concentration
of either NAD+ (Figure 3E) or CbFDH
(Figure 3D) directly
influenced the reaction rate while the concentration of rAaeUPO (Figure 3C) had
no clear influence.

Overall, we conclude that the photochemical
oxidation of NADH (being
influenced by the in situ concentration of NADH and the concentration
of the photoexcited photocatalyst(s)) was overall rate-limiting under
the conditions investigated.

Interestingly, with methylene blue,
an acceleration of the reaction
rate was observed over time (Figure 2). This acceleration could be assigned to a photochemical
activation of the photocatalyst as a similar observation was made
upon preincubation of methylene blue alone by red light (Figure S6); blue light did not induce this acceleration.
Currently, we are lacking a plausible explanation for this activation
effect, and further studies will be necessary to understand (and synthetically
exploit) this observation.

One major challenge observed, especially
using FMN as photocatalyst
(Figure 2 ⧫),
was the poor long-term stability of the overall reaction. Particularly,
the NADH regeneration reaction was impaired (Figure S7). We therefore investigated the stability of CbFDH in the presence of the photocatalysts upon illumination (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Stability of CbFDH in the presence of some photocatalysts
upon illumination. General conditions: 2.4 μM CbFDH, 50 μM photocatalysts, 50 mM KPi buffer, pH 7, 300 rpm,
30 °C. For comparison, the half-life time of CbFDH in the presence of the photocatalysts but under dark conditions
was 433 min.

Especially, the flavin
derived photocatalysts rapidly inactivated CbFDH.
Most probably, this occurred due to oxidative modification
of surface-bound amino acids leading to enzyme inactivation/denaturation.
Further experiments identifying the amino acids involved are currently
ongoing. On the basis of this, CbFDH mutants exhibiting
increased robustness in the presence of the exited photocatalysts
can be conceived. Also, physical separation of photocatalysts and CbFDH may represent a solution to this inactivation issue.
In similar cases, this strategy resulted in significant stabilizations
of the overall reaction.27−30

Another issue of the photoenzymatic reaction
system may be the
well-known photobleaching of the organic photocatalysts.31,32 Particularly, the flavin-based photocatalysts exhibited a rather
modest stability upon illumination with 450 nm (Figure 5). Safranine
derivatives excelled in this respect by more than 100-fold longer
half-life times as compared to, e.g., FMN.

Figure 5 Stability of the photocatalysts
upon illumination. General conditions:
100 μM photocatalysts, 50 mM KPi buffer, pH 7, 300 rpm, 30 °C.

These findings also were confirmed
in photoenzymatic reactions
using FMN, phenosafranine, or methylene blue, respectively (Table 2). Compared to the
first, the latter two gave significantly higher turnover numbers for
all catalysts employed.

MeOH (v/v)), T = 30 °C, polychromatic light
source.

Overall, we have
demonstrated that simple electron donors such
as formate can drive peroxygenase-catalyzed oxyfunctionalization reactions.
Furthermore, in this study, we have demonstrated that a more efficient
usage of the visible light spectrum is possible by combining complementary
photocatalysts.

Admittedly, this system still is far from preparative
applicability.
Especially, the robustness of the formate dehydrogenase used represents
a practical limitation, which may be overcome by evaluating FDHs from
other sources or CbFDH mutants with improved resistance.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that despite the early stage of development
the proposed reaction scheme already compares well with the state-of-the-art
system.

We are convinced that with this study we are paving
the way toward
more efficient photoenzymatic reaction schemes.
