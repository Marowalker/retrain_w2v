Soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) is a prototype
for nonadiabatic hydrogen
tunneling reactions and, as such, has served as the subject of numerous
theoretical studies. In this work, we report a nearly temperature-independent
kinetic isotope effect (KIE) with an average KIE value of 661 ±
27 for a double mutant (DM) of SLO at six temperatures. The data are
well-reproduced within a vibronically nonadiabatic proton-coupled
electron transfer model in which the active site has become rigidified
compared to wild-type enzyme and single-site mutants. A combined temperature–pressure
perturbation further shows that temperature-dependent global motions
within DM-SLO are more resistant to perturbation by elevated pressure.
These findings provide strong experimental support for the model of
hydrogen tunneling in SLO, where optimization of both local protein
and ligand motions and distal conformational rearrangements is a prerequisite
for effective proton vibrational wave function overlap between the
substrate and the active-site iron cofactor.

Understanding the physical underpinnings
of enzymatic rate enhancement lays the groundwork for the rational
design of biomimetic catalysts. Although applications of transition
state theory with semiclassical tunneling contributions to enzymatic
hydrogen transfer reactions have agreed well with experimental data
in many cases,1−9 enzymatic C–H activation reactions have proven to be especially
challenging.10−12 To address these challenges, a variety of theoretical
and computational methods have been developed.13−18 However, given the complexity and multidimensionality of hydrogen
transfer reactions, a mutually agreed upon correspondence between
experimental results and theoretical analyses has remained elusive.
Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (SLO) (Figures S1, S2) is a working prototype for theoretical developments in the field
of such proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions8,14,19−28 because of the large (ca. 80) and nearly temperature-independent
(ΔEa = 0.9 kcal/mol)29 hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs)
in the wild-type (WT) enzyme.19,30 Recently, SLO has also
served as an excellent system in which to interrogate the relationship
between multidimensional conformational sampling and hydrogen tunneling.31−33

The observed rate constant (kobs) for
enzyme-catalyzed PCET processes can be represented as the fraction
of “active” enzyme–substrate
(E·S) substates that lead to catalysis (Fconf) multiplied by a nonadiabatic PCET rate constant (kPCET), as in eq 1:33 1  Fconf is associated
with the stochastic sampling of different conformational states within
a global free-energy landscape and represents the probability of sampling
those substates that are suitable for reaction (i.e., the hydrogen
is pointing toward its acceptor with a sufficiently short donor–acceptor
distance). Thus, Fconf represents the
equilibrium constant between the sets of inactive and active enzyme–substrate
substates. The second term kPCET is the
rate constant for PCET within the set of active substates of the enzyme–substrate
complex in quasi-equilibrium.19,22,25,27 Invoking well-defined approximations
to include the proton donor–acceptor motion,27,34−36 this rate constant can be formulated as a thermal
average over the donor–acceptor distance (DAD) sampling mode R: 2  where kPCETfixed(R) is
the PCET rate constant at fixed R. Previously, quantitative
diagnostics were used to illustrate vibronic and electron–proton
nonadiabaticity for the PCET reaction catalyzed by SLO.27,37,38 In this nonadiabatic regime, kPCETfixed(R) depends on the reorganization energy λ,
the reaction free energy ΔGo, the
electronic coupling, the proton vibrational energy levels, and the
overlap integrals between reactant and product proton vibrational
wave functions.16,39 In this expression, P(R) is the probability distribution function for
the DAD and is often associated with a harmonic oscillator with equilibrium
distance R0 and frequency Ω. The
DAD mode is expected to be more repulsive for shorter distances, and
this effect is easily included in eq 2 by using an anharmonic P(R). Such anharmonicity has been shown to alter the quantitative
parameter values but not the overall trends. Analytical expressions
for kPCET (eq S1) have been derived and shown to be mathematically equivalent to eq 2 in various well-defined
regimes.27,35−37 These analytical expressions
are used for the calculations presented herein.

Equation 1 is based
on the approximation that the fraction of active conformations can
be multiplied by an effective rate constant for such conformations.
As discussed elsewhere,40−42 however, there are many active
conformations with different rate constants. Nevertheless, this treatment
provides a useful qualitative model for interpreting the experimental
data. Both Fconf and kPCET are temperature-dependent, whereas only kPCET is sensitive to isotopic substitution of the substrate
because the impact of substituting a single H by D in the substrate
on the global conformational sampling of the solvated protein–substrate
system is expected to be negligible. Thus, the KIE value reflects
only the properties of kPCET, and its
temperature dependence can be shown to arise predominantly from equilibrium
thermal sampling of the DAD. The latter is often relatively minor
in native enzymes due to favorable alignment of the donor and acceptor
groups within the active substates19,25 but can become
quite significant when the protein is perturbed by, for example, site-specific
mutagenesis.43,44

The recent observation
of an unusually high room-temperature KIE
of ca. 500–700 for an active-site double-mutant L546A/L754A
of SLO (DM-SLO)45 was shown to be fit within
a vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory and to arise from a significant
increase in barrier width (i.e., a longer equilibrium DAD), resulting
in poor overlap of the reactant and product proton vibrational wave
functions. The unique feature of DM-SLO has been the predicted increase
in the frequency (Ω) of the DAD sampling mode that prevents
effective local sampling of E·S substates conducive to efficient
tunneling (i.e., with short DADs and high tunneling probabilities).32,43−45 In the present study, we focus on understanding the
inferred rigidification of DM-SLO using several distinctive kinetic
probes. The previous KIEs for DM-SLO were measured with two independent
experimental techniques, leading to a value of 537 ± 55 via single
turnover under anaerobic measurement at 35 °C and 729 ±
26 via steady-state measurement in air at 30 °C.45 The difference between the KIEs at 30 and 35 °C within
this work was attributed to differences in conditions and methodologies
rather than to a strong trend in the temperature dependence of the
KIE. The present paper presents the KIEs for DM-SLO measured over
six temperatures using a single, consistent experimental technique
and shows that fitting of the data via either the phenomenological
Arrhenius equation or an analytical nonadiabatic PCET model allows
comparison of DAD sampling between DM-SLO and WT. We further explore
the combined impact of temperature and pressure on the kinetic parameters
of DM-SLO as a probe for more global conformational sampling.

As reported herein, DM-SLO is characterized by KIEs that are less
sensitive to temperature than the WT enzyme, corroborating the proposal
that the enormous KIE displayed by this variant results from an increase
in both the equilibrium DAD for the active substates and the
frequency that controls DAD sampling. Additionally, DM-SLO
is found to be the first SLO variant studied that is able to resist
a pressure-induced perturbation in the temperature dependence of its
observed rate constant, which is associated with Fconf and therefore the conformational free energy landscape.
This observation implies a broadly based alteration in catalysis-linked
protein motions occurring both at the enzyme active site and more
globally over the entire protein, associated predominantly with changes
in kPCET and Fconf, respectively. With these new data, we conclude that a vibronically
nonadiabatic treatment of hydrogen tunneling, when coupled to a stochastic
search for catalytically active protein substates, provides a compelling
physical model for the kinetic behavior of SLO.27,37

The steady-state rate constants of DM-SLO toward all-protio-linoleic
acid (H-LA) were previously measured by means of a UV–vis continuous
assay, revealing a ca. 104-fold decrease in kcat and a substantially elevated EaH compared to the WT enzyme.45 For
the present work, the extremely slow turnover rate of DM-SLO with
the isotopically labeled substrate, 11,11-2H2-linoleic acid (d2-LA) over the full
experimental temperature range necessitated the more sensitive, discontinuous
HPLC assay (Section 1.3 in SI).45 A large number of controls were first conducted
to establish a working temperature range (5 to 30 °C, Section
1.4 in SI). While this range is somewhat
more narrow than earlier studies of WT and single site mutants of
SLO,19,43 it remained possible to assess temperature
trends in the KIEs (albeit with greater error bars).

The kinetic
data for d2-LA were collected
at a single concentration of substrate, 35 μM. This is estimated
to be 17.5-fold larger than an estimated KM value of 2 μM (or smaller), according to the previously measured
kinetic data for H-LA and KIE values at 30 °C.45,46 Given the relatively small temperature range of the present study
and the observation that the KM for the
deuterated substrate is reduced relative to H-LA,19,43 the observed reaction rates constants can be concluded to represent
the maximum rate constant (kcat-D) in all instances. Due to a slight modification (Section 1.2 in SI) in protein preparations, the rate constants
of DM-SLO toward H-LA were also remeasured as a frame of reference
from 5 to 30 °C using the much more rapid and simple continuous
UV–vis spectroscopic assay.47 Ambient
levels of O2 were in large excess over the KM(O2) for both protio- and deuterio-substrates
(Section 1.3 in SI). One further control,
in which the rate of H-LA was also measured via the HPLC method, was
found to yield results comparable to UV–vis methods.

The resulting KIE values at corresponding temperatures are obtained
from the ratio of kcat-H from the
continuous protocol to kcat-D from
the discontinuous protocol (Table 1). The kcat-H and KIE values for DM-SLO at 30 °C are 0.0225 ± 0.0013
s–1 and 692 ± 43, respectively, and they are
consistent with previously reported values.45 The KIE values in the investigated temperature regime lie within
550–760, with ca. 10% accompanying error. Data fitted to a
line over the full experimental temperature range for kcat-H, kcat-D and their ratio are illustrated in Figure 1. The temperature dependence of the KIEs
(ΔEa = 0.3 ± 0.7 kcal/mol)29 is comparable or even smaller than the temperature
dependence of the KIEs for WT SLO (0.9 ± 0.2 kcal/mol)19 but has a larger error.

An alternative method of analysis
for the data in Table 1 utilizes analytical nonadiabatic
rate constant expressions for hydrogen tunneling in PCET reactions
(eq S1 and Section 1.6 in SI). As introduced
above, the main parameters that control the temperature dependence
of the KIEs are Ω, the frequency for the DAD sampling mode,
and R0, the equilibrium DAD for the active
enzyme–substrate substates.27 For
many years, vibronically nonadiabatic PCET rate-constant expressions
have been invoked to fit the experimental data for SLO,19,22,25,26,43−45 and it has been shown
that well-defined values for R0 and Ω
can be obtained from the magnitude and temperature dependence of the
KIE within the framework of the particular rate constant expression
and other parameters used (Table S3).27,43,44

The present study, characterized
by a more narrow temperature range
(5–30 °C) and extremely slow kcat-D values, leads to a larger error envelope (Figure S3) that is compatible with a range of fits rather than a singular
fit.45 To provide a more quantitative analysis
of Ω and R0 ranges, we have analyzed
the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between theoretically predicted
and experimentally measured KIEs over a large range of Ω and R0 values, thereby converging on a swath of theoretical
curves that span the experimental points and their standard deviations
(Figure 2, right panel).
The latter fits are presented as colored dots (Figure 2, left panel, RMSD < 150) within a gray-scaled
contour plot of all possible fits (with the reasonable upper value
for Ω of 500 cm–1, which would represent a
nearly completely rigid active site). Within this set of fits with
RMSD < 150, we estimate that ∼80% of the fits represent an increased DAD sampling frequency value relative to the fit for
the WT enzyme (indicated by the single red point in Figure 2, left panel). This
percentage of fits would only increase further if Ω were allowed
to exceed 500 cm–1.

KIE data for DM-SLO. The experimental data for the temperature dependence
of the KIE (black circles with error bars) are shown in the right
panel together with the theoretical curves for different sets of the
equilibrium DAD, R0, and DAD sampling
frequency, Ω (colored lines). The colors of the lines represent
the RMSD (upper bar right panel) calculated as the differences between
the theoretically predicted and experimentally measured KIEs for the
six experimentally measured temperatures for a given R0 and Ω. The mass of the DAD sampling mode was chosen
to be 14 amu as determined by independent molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of WT SLO.25 The left panel
shows the data for RMSD < 150 (colored dots using same color scheme
for the RMSD as in right panel) in relation to all possible fits (gray
background) with 500 cm–1 as the upper limit for
Ω.

We next investigated the status
of global conformational sampling
in DM-SLO by examining the combined impact of temperature and pressure
on the observed rates of DM-SLO toward H-LA as substrate. Using established
protocols for the WT SLO and three single site mutants (section 1.5
in SI),31 the
resulting data can be evaluated in the context of a pressure parameter S, which is the ratio of the kcat-H at each elevated pressure to kcat-H at ambient pressure (Table 2). At 288 K, with the exception of WT, all of the rate constants
for H-LA increase with pressure, and this effect tends to be more
pronounced for the mutants that contain L754A. The increased rate
constant with pressure arises from compressed DADs, and the enhanced
effect for mutants is most easily rationalized in the context of packing
defects that result from the mutation of interior hydrophobic residues
to smaller side chains, leading to increased equilibrium DADs that
can be overcome to some extent at high pressure. Notably, the S values are smaller for the DM than for one of its parent
single mutants, L754A (Table 2, entries 9,10 vs entries 7,8), consistent with enhanced active
site rigidity upon the introduction of the second hydrophobic side
chain mutation L546A. A second more compelling feature of DM-SLO emerges
when the sensitivity of S to increased pressure is
measured as a function of temperature (see Table 2 for two extreme temperatures). In contrast
to the variants analyzed previously, the behavior of DM-SLO with respect
to increased pressure is observed to be unchanged between 15 and 35
°C. This effect was examined more quantitatively across five
temperatures to evaluate changes in the empirical energies of activation
as the pressure is elevated, Figure 3. In contrast to other mutants that display increasingly
elevated EaH values at high pressure,31 the DM-SLO displays an unaltered EaH value of ca. 8 kcal/mol under all conditions (Figure 3).

empirical energy of activation (EaH) for kcat-H for WT, I553V, L546A, L754A, and
L546A/L754A. The value as a function
of pressure for WT, I553V, L546A, and L754A is from a previous study.31

An interpretation of the origins of changes in empirical EaH values based on the fitting from kcat will, in general, be considerably more complex
than the analysis of the magnitude and temperature dependence of KIEs,
for which the isotopically insensitive Fconf and weakly isotope-dependent reaction driving force (ΔG°) and reorganization energy (λ) largely cancel
each other. By contrast, EaH will be influenced
by many different factors, including λ, ΔG°, the DAD frequency Ω, and the more global conformational
landscape reflected by Fconf. Previous
studies of WT and three other SLO mutants have demonstrated that hydrostatic
pressure effects on their KIEs are very small, ruling out a large
local impact on H-transfer and pointing toward the more global protein
effects related to Fconf as the origin
of elevated EaH with increasing pressure.31 The latter has been attributed to a pressure-induced
population of low-activity or inactive protein substates that decreases
the fraction of catalytically competent protein substates within the
conformational landscape. While the greatly reduced rate and enormous
KIEs for DM-SLO precluded a quantitative examination of pressure effects
on the KIEs, the very small ΔEa has
already indicated a more rigid active site structure. We propose that
the singular properties of DM-SLO, which include an extremely elevated EaH at 1 bar pressure together with no further
increase of this parameter past 1 kbar, indicate a pressure resistance
of the global conformational landscape to further perturbation beyond
the perturbation already introduced upon the insertion of the double
mutation itself.45,46

The newly available data
and analyses fully support the earlier
suggestion that the DM is an outlier within the SLO family.19,43,45,47 Almost all the active-site single mutants (I553X series and L546A)19,43 and an alternative double-mutant (L546A/L553A)47 present increased temperature dependencies of the KIEs
to varying degrees (Figure 4A, Table S1). For these well-documented
behaviors, the generation of a packing defect that leads to longer
(i.e., less tunneling effective) equilibrium DADs within the active
protein substates is able to undergo compensation by an associated decrease in the frequency of the DAD sampling mode Ω.
The latter enables a recovery via DAD sampling from initially expanded
equilibrium DADs and results in largely unchanged KIEs of around 80
(Figure 4B, lower left
panel, Table S3). In this context, DM-SLO
is the first variant that demonstrates a clearly expanded equilibrium
DAD within the active substates that is accompanied by an unaltered
or even increased DAD sampling frequency (Figure 4B, lower right panel), establishing this
set of properties as the source of the enormously elevated KIE that
is nearly temperature-independent. In addition to the rigidified active
site, DM-SLO is also the first variant that shows an unaltered EaH under high pressure (Table 2 and Figure 3), suggesting an increased rigidity in its global conformational
landscape relative to WT and three other mutants.31

Figure 4 (A) The Dkcat value at 30
°C is plotted vs the ΔEa value
for WT (black),1 I553X series (green),43 L546A and L754A (blue),19 other double-mutant L546A/I553A (orange),47 and double-mutant L546A/L754A (red). The vertical dashed line represents
the temperature dependence of WT (ΔEa = 0.9 kcal/mol). (B) Different patterns that connect the changes
in R0 and Ω. A close distance between
the H-donor (D) and H-acceptor (A) is expected from the properties
of WT SLO. Below and pointing left, the R0 and Ω change at the same time allowing recovery to WT-like
behavior. Below and pointing right, only R0 gets elongated while the Ω remains the same or even larger
as in the case of DM-SLO. The tightness of the spring represents the
frequency of DAD sampling, where the increased tightness indicates
an increased Ω value, and vice versa.

In summary, the experimentally reported data for DM-SLO provide
a robust validation of a vibronically nonadiabatic treatment of hydrogen
tunneling in this system and others,10,16,19,27,43 accompanied by stochastic sampling of available protein substates
within a spatially and temporally complex conformational landscape.31−33,46,48 As discussed, DM-SLO presents a range of distinctive features that
appear to be associated with decreased flexibility both at its active
site and throughout the entire protein. The molecular origins of these
aggregate features are of great interest. One possibility is the presence
of extra bound water molecules,45 which
contrasts with an absence of observable bound water within the active
site of the I553X series.33,43 An explanation for
the full range of functional impairment that accompanies the seemingly
simple reduction in size of two active-site hydrophobic side chains
will be the subject of further investigations.
