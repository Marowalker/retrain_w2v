Carbon–carbon
bond formation is the key reaction for organic
synthesis to construct the carbon framework of organic molecules.
The review gives a selection of biocatalytic C–C-bond-forming
reactions which have been investigated during the last 5 years and
which have already been proven to be applicable for organic synthesis.
In most cases, the reactions lead to products functionalized at the
site of C–C-bond formation (e.g., α-hydroxy ketones,
aminoalcohols, diols, 1,4-diketones, etc.) or allow to decorate aromatic
and heteroaromatic molecules. Furthermore, examples for cyclization
of (non)natural precursors leading to saturated carbocycles are given
as well as the stereoselective cyclopropanation of olefins affording
cyclopropanes. Although many tools are already available, recent research
also makes it clear that nature provides an even broader set of enzymes
to perform specific C–C coupling reactions. The possibilities
are without limit; however, a big library of variants for different
types of reactions is required to have the specific enzyme for a desired
specific (stereoselective) reaction at hand.

1 Introduction
The
creation of carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds is the
key reaction for organic synthesis to set up the carbon backbone of
every organic molecule by connecting smaller substructures in order
to gain more complex molecules.1 Thereby
the generation of multifunctional products and asymmetry is of inestimable
value but at the same time challenging. Consequently, sophisticated
methods for asymmetric synthesis as well as protection/deprotection
strategies have to be considered. In this context, biocatalytic C–C
couplings represent a concise (asymmetric) alternative for the preparation
of multifunctional products.2 Biocatalysis
is continuously gaining impact for the synthesis of organic molecules,
due to the development and identification of improved enzymes enabled
by recently advanced methods of molecular and computational biology.3 Recent biocatalytic developments of selected
highly active biocatalysts applicable for organic synthesis with tight
control of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity are the focus of
this Perspective. Enzymes discussed involve aldolases, thiamine-diphosphate
(ThDP)-dependent carboligases, Pictet–Spenglerases, oxidases,
prenyltransferases, squalene/hopene cyclases or engineered hemoproteins
for cyclopropanation. The Perspective has been structured according
to the functional group arising from the C–C-bond-forming step
or—if not applicable—according to the product formed
(Scheme 1). Each functional
group or type of product is discussed individually, thereby focusing
on enzymes and methodologies which were applied for organic synthesis
to transform especially non-natural substrates leading to (multifunctional)
targets with high optical purity. In a final chapter, selected examples
of promising, novel identified C–C-coupling enzymes will be
presented which might get more into focus in the next years. Polyketide
synthases,4 methyltransferases, or hydroxy
nitrilases are out of the scope of this review.2e

by Biocatalytic
C–C-Bond Formation at the Site of C–C-Bond Formation
Discussed in This Perspective
The multifunctional products
are formed by reaction of an acceptor (acceptor part marked in blue)
and a donor (red). Additionally saturated carbocycles and cyclopropanes
are reviewed subsequently.

2 C–C-Bond
Formation Leading to 1,2-Diols
Employing Aldolases
2.1 Overview
The most
common C–C-bond-forming
reaction in organic chemistry is most likely the aldol addition.5 In nature, this reaction is catalyzed by aldolases
which perform the reversible and stereoselective addition of a donor
to an acceptor.6 Coupling for instance
an α-hydroxy carbonyl compound as donor with an aldehyde as
acceptor will lead to a 1,2-diol moiety at the site of C–C-bond
formation (Scheme 2). The reaction allows the simultaneous formation of two chiral centers.

Scheme 2 General Biocatalytic Route toward the Chiral 1,2-Diol Functionality
DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
DHA: dihydroxyacetone; HA: hydroxyacetone; HB: hydroxybutantone; GO:
glycolaldehyde. FSA: d-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase; FruA:
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; RhuA: rhamnose-1-phosphate aldolase;
FucA: fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase; TagA: tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase.

These 1,2-diol-forming aldolases
are mainly exploited for the synthesis
of carbohydrates and analogues and can be generally divided into (i)
dihydroxyacetone phosphate-dependent (DHAP) aldolases and (ii) DHAP-independent
aldolases. Important representatives within the DHAP-family are the
commercially available fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FruA) from
rabbit muscle (RAMA), fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA) from E. coli, tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (TagA) and rhamnose-1-phosphate
aldolases from E. coli (RhuAEc)
or thermophilic Thermotoga maritima (Rhu1PATm).7 The latter has just recently
been characterized, and its synthetic potential is currently under
investigation.8

Aside from DHAP-dependent
aldolases, d-fructose-6-phosphate
aldolase from E. coli (FSA) represents an exception.
Its unique feature to accept nonphosphorylated donor substrates such
as dihydroxyacetone (DHA, also weakly accepted by RhuAEc9), hydroxyacetone (HA), hydroxybutantone
(HB), or glycolaldehyde (GO) instead of (expensive) phosphate analogues
as well as its unbiased stereoselectivity [syn-configured
adducts (3S,4R)] makes this enzyme
an attractive target for biocatalytic synthesis. The versatility of
the wild-type FSA was already demonstrated in multiple syntheses yielding
carbohydrates and analogues,10 whereas
most recent investigations focused on the immobilization and scale-up
techniques, respectively.11 Detailed knowledge
of the enzyme structure,12 the catalytically
relevant active-site residues and the catalytic mechanism of FSA has
enabled protein engineering to further extend its substrate scope.13 Several robust variants with different substrate
preferences have been evolved (e.g., FSA-A129S, FSA-A129S/A165G, FSA-L107Y/A129G
or the triple variant FSA-L107Y/A129G/A165G). Moreover, for the first
time, a novel variant which exhibits an outstanding donor tolerance
toward sterically demanding nucleophiles has just been reported.14 The variant FSA-L107/L163A is able to accept
HA-derivatives as donor, including linear, branched and constrained
C3 to C7 1-hydroxyalkan-2-ones as well as several DHA-derived ethers
(Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Variant
FSA-L107A/L163A Is Able To Accept a Broad Set of Donors Including
Long-Chained, Branched or Constrained Alkyl Residues as well as Ether
Residues
Transformations of
3-hydroxybutanal with this unique double variant
revealed that it retained the native d-threo diastereoselectivity,
thus providing the corresponding C2-substituted sugar analogues with
perfect stereoselectivities and high isolated yields (25–89%).

Other enzymes showing promiscuous activity for aldol formation
and Michael addition such as lipases15 and
the investigated engineered 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase16 possessing a N-terminal proline
as reactive moiety have been reviewed recently.2c

2.2 Carboyhydrates and O-Phosphorylated
Sugars and Derivatives
A series of aldose carbohydrates with
up to four chiral centers was constructed by sequential de novo connection
of simple achiral aldehyde precursors in one pot. Reacting 2 equivalents
of glycolaldehyde and 1 equivalent of an acceptor aldehyde (R1CHO) resulted in the desired aldose derivatives (Scheme 4).17

Scheme 4 Biocatalytic of d- and l-Hexose
Derivatives from
Simple Achiral Precursors by Engineered E. coli-FSA
Variants
Stereochemical control was assured
by engineered variants of FSA,
which afforded d-aldoses with excellent diastereoselectivities,
high conversions (50–98%), and isolated yields. Two double
variants (FSA-A129T/S166G and FSA-A129T/A165G) and one triple variant
(FSA-A129T/A165G/S166G) emerged as best candidates for the preparation
of several deoxy- and O-substituted-d-hexoses.
To prepare the corresponding l-aldoses, two FSA variants
were operated in a stepwise fashion, whereby for installing the inverted
C5 center of the l-aldose, for example, the variant FSA-A129G
was employed in the second step (conversions 41–81%).

Although FSA variants proved to work well, also the original wild-type
enzyme is still extensively used, which is mainly due to its superior
preference for hydroxyacetone compared to most FSA variants. For instance,
WT-FSA was selected as catalyst for the preparation of several O-phosphorylated d-ketoses: The cross-aldol addition
of glycolaldehyde phosphate and hydroxyacetone furnished 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate, an interesting chemotherapeutic target,
with >97% conversion, high isolated yield (85%), and excellent
stereoselectivity
(only d-threo-configured products). Using the same methodology
but d-ribose-5-phophate with hydroxyacetone or 1-hydroxy-2-butanone
as substrates, several C8 and C9 d-ketoses were made available
as well (77–79% yield, Scheme 5).18 Moreover, therapeutically
relevant O-phosphorylated sugars like d-arabinose-5-phophate, d-fructose-6-phosphate, or 1-deoxy-d-fructose-6-phosphate
were prepared at 100 mg scale via WT-FSA-coupled cascades.19

Scheme 5 Wild-Type FSA Used for the Aldol Reaction
of Glycolaldehyde Phosphate
or d-Ribose-5-phosphate with Hydroxyacetone or 1-Hydroxy-2-butanone
More recently, a combination
of a ThDP-dependent carboligase and
an aldolase was embedded in a four-step chemoenzymatic route to access
5- or 6-C-aryl carbohydrates with up to good overall
yields (11–82%) (Scheme 6).20 In the first step, an enzymatic
benzoin reaction of an aromatic aldehyde with dimethoxyacetaldehyde
was performed using benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas
fluorescens (BAL). After reduction of the resulting
2R-hydroxyketone and removal of the protection group,
an aldol addition of (di)hydroxy acetone or glycolaldehyde was carried
out by selected FSA variants or RhuA. Although the FSA-catalyzed aldol
reactions were stereoselective yielding 6-C-aryl-l-sorbose and 5-C-aryl-l-xylose derivatives,
epimeric products with respect to the C4-carbon of the corresponding
6-C-arylated l-fructoses and l-tagatoses
were obtained with RhuA.

2.3 Imino- and Nitrocyclitols
Sugar-related
imino- and nitrocyclitols display various biological activities including
inhibition of glycosidases, glycotransferases, or hexoaminidases.21 Nitrocyclitols in particular are synthetic precursors
of aminocyclitols22 which have important
antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal activities. Moreover, natural
nitrosugars have been described.23 The
application of WT-FSA for the preparation of several small pyrrolidine
and piperidine-based iminocyclitols from azido- and Cbz-aminoaldehydes
has already been reported.24 Recently,
a structure-guided redesign of several FSA variants expanded the acceptor
scope toward bulky α-substituted N-Cbz-aminoaldehydes.
Sufficient space in the catalyst’s active site was conferred
by altering two essential residues, S166G and R134X (X = P, S, V)
followed by combining them with well-established variants from earlier
studies. This finally allowed accessing a broad set of “constrained
iminocyclitols” like pyrrolizidines, indolizidines, or quinolizidines
by FSA with up to >90% de (Scheme 7).25

Scheme 7 Chemoenzymatic Route
Toward Iminocyclitols Combining a FSA-Catalyzed
Aldol Addition of Chiral Bulky N-Cbz-Aminoaldehydes
and a Reductive Amination (H2, Pd/C)
Stereogenic centers marked
with an asterisk refer to the positions where epimerization and/or
racemization occurred.

While aldol additions
with dihydroxyacetone or hydroxyacteone resulted
in excellent stereoselectivities [>98:2, (3S,4R)], partial racemization of some N-Cbz-aminoaldehydes
during aldol additions with glycolaldehyde was observed depending
on the FSA variant used. The reductive amination step was highly stereoselective
for the aldol adducts derived from (R)-configured
acceptors, furnishing a broad set of linear and branched alkyl-substituted
pyrrolidines, quinolizidines, indolizidines, as well as a pipecolic
acid derivative as a single stereoisomer. The pyrrolizidine series
as well as iminocyclitols resulting from the corresponding (S)-N-Cbz-aminoaldehydes were obtained as
a mixture of epimers. Besides FSA-based catalysis, more conformationally
constrained iminocyclitols, including indolizidines and quinolizidines
were recently prepared via chemoenzymatic methodologies involving
the DHAP-dependent aldolases FucA or RhuAEc.26 Furthermore, several benzopyrrolizidine- and
cyclohexapyrrolizidine-type cyclitols were readily obtained from a
three-step chemoenzymatic synthesis using FucA-F131A variant and an
acid phosphate.27 Due to their strong α-glycosidase
inhibitory properties,28 pharmaceutically
relevant pyrrolidine- and piperidine-based iminocyclitols such as
1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabintol (DAB), its corresponding
enantiomer LAB, pipecolic acids, or the nutritionally relevant d-fagomine represent attractive target products of multistep
chemoenzymatic syntheses involving the powerful DHAP-independent FSA.29

By coupling l- or d-threonine
aldolases with
DHAP/DHA aldolases and a reductive amination step, polyhydroxypipecolic
acid analogues were obtained as a single diastereoisomer and with
excellent recoveries (>99% yield).30 Moreover,
the suitability of selected FSA variants to operate in microreactors
as “free enzyme” was demonstrated for the synthesis
of d-fagomine precursors.31 The
same precursor was prepared with high isolated yields (79%) in a three-enzyme
cascade, employing FSA-A129S, horse-liver dehydrogenase (HLADH) for
the oxidation of the achiral starting material as well as the cofactor
recycling enzyme NADH-oxidase (NOX).32

Several stereoselective cascades for the synthesis of nitrocyclitols
have been developed. Most of them required at least two enzymes, namely,
a DHAP-dependent aldolase and a phytase or phosphatase for phosphate
hydrolysis (Scheme 8).33 The sequence consists of the enzyme-catalyzed
aldol reaction followed by a spontaneous, stereoselective nitro-Henry
reaction of the aldol adduct, furnishing the final nitrocyclitol.
Current examples on aldolase-catalyzed nitrocyclitol synthesis mainly
focused on optimizations with respect to isolated yield, reaction
steps and the employed aldolase. In this context, the need of chemically
synthesized DHAP was recently eliminated by performing an ATP-dependent
in situ preparation of DHAP from DHA, catalyzed by dihydroxyacetone
kinase (DHAK) and an acetate kinase (AK) for ATP-regeneration (Scheme 8, B).34

Scheme 8 Stereoselective Chemoenzymatic Routes Toward
Nitrocyclitols: (A)
Wildtype-FSA or FSA-A129S-Catalyzed Aldol Reaction Using DHA or HA
as Donor; (B) DHAP-Dependent FruA- or RhuA-Catalyzed Aldol Reaction
in Combination with the ATP-Dependent Dihydroxyacetone Kinase (DHAK)
for the In Situ Preparation of DHAP
Additionally, an ATP-regeneration
system is required.

Choosing either FucA or
RhuA, nitrocyclitols with different stereoselectivities
at the C2- and C3-carbon were obtained. While FucA provided the expected
(2R,3S)-configuration in most cases,
RhuA was much less reliable for the expected (2R,3R)-configuration, hence leading to product mixtures. The
Henry reaction, however, was highly stereoselective at the C1- and
C6-carbon resulting in a trans relative configuration
for R′ and NO2.

In another example, a concise
one-pot-one-enzyme chemoenzymatic
process using wild-type FSA or the variant FSA-A129S was established.
Depending on the donor (DHA or HA), several new (deoxy C7) nitrocyclitols
were prepared starting from nitrobutanal-related aldehydes (Scheme 8A).35

Despite being independent of DHAP, the main benefits
of this route
were improved isolated yields (up to 71% compared to FruA33a,33b) and the FSA-based high stereocontrol at the C2- and C3-carbon,
respectively. However, rather low diastereoselectivites were obtained,
especially if C1 was a methyl group (derived from HA), leading to
mixtures of four isomers, which were separated by flash chromatography.

3 C–C-Bond Formation Leading to 1,2-Aminoalcohols:
(α-Quaternary)-β-Hydroxy-α-Amino Acids
From a chemical point of view, the stereoselective formation of
the 1,2-aminoalcohol scaffold exhibiting additionally a quaternary
stereogenic center is considered as a major challenge. Nevertheless,
chiral vicinal aminoalcohols are of utmost importance for biotechnological
and biomedical purposes. In this context, (α-quaternary)-β-hydroxy-α-amino
acids are key products and precursors for multiple fields of application,
including immunology, neurology, cancer therapy, infectious diseases,
or biomimetic studies.36

Biocatalytically,
the 1,2-aminoalcohol motif can be accessed via
numerous (multi)enzymatic reactions,37 but
in terms of C–C-bond formation, an aldolase-catalyzed addition
of an amino donor (shown in red) to a desired aldehyde acceptor (shown
in blue) allows the stereoselective, direct implementation of a vicinal
aminoalcohol-functionality into a β-hydroxy-α-amino acid
final product (Scheme 9).7a

Scheme 9 General Biocatalytic Route toward
the Chiral 1,2-Aminoalcohol Functionality
at the Site of C–C-Bond Formation
Gly: glycine; d-Ala: d-alanine; d-Ser: d-serine; d-Cys: d-cysteine; SHMT: serine
hydroxymethyltransferase; LTA: l-threonine aldolase; DTA: d-threonine aldolase.

The two aldolases,
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and l- or d-specific threonine aldolase (LTA and DTA),
are pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes which, based
on their donor preference, catalyze the enantioselective and diastereoselective
formation of either β-hydroxy-α-amino acids (donor = Gly)
or α,α-disubstituted-β-hydroxy-α-amino acids
(donor = d-Ala, d-Ser, d-Cys).2e,2f,38 The latter acids bear a quaternary
stereogenic center and were recently made available upon finding the
first natural aldolases which tolerate amino acid donors other than
glycine.36a,39 In general, the stereoselectivity at Cα is enzyme-dependent and was found to be perfect for
all so-far identified aldolases (ee >99%); however, low or no stereocontrol
at the Cβ resulted mostly in syn/anti mixtures with poor diastereoselectivities.
To address this issue, ongoing investigations are majorly focused
on enzyme engineering as well as the development of appropriate screening
techniques for the identification of improved enzymes.40

Following up on previous studies which
aimed for a broader donor
tolerance, a single variant of the SHMT from Streptococcus
thermophilus (SHMTSth)
has been developed recently via rational design with high affinity
for d-Ser and d-Ala.41 The SHMTSthY55T-variant catalyzed aldol
additions of d-Ser to a broad set of aldehydes with low to
almost perfect diastereoselectivities (Scheme 10).

Scheme 10 Chiral α,α-Disubstituted-β-Hydroxy-α-Amino
Acids Obtained with SHMTSth or LTA-Av
Selected examples using either d-Ala or d-Ser are shown. Substrate loadings for SHMTSth: acceptor (2.5 mM), donor (10 mM), 24
h. For LTA-Av: acceptor (50 mM), donor (500 mM),
24 h. n.d.: not determined. n.c.: not converted.

The resulting α,α-disubstituted-β-hydroxy-α-amino
acids were always anti with respect to the α-amino
and β-hydroxy group, whereas more syn-product
(and lower de) was obtained if d-Ala or Gly were employed
instead.

At the same time, five novel l- and d-specific
threonine aldolases were identified which accept d-Ala and d-Ser. From the investigated LTAs and DTAs in this study, the l-specific TA originating from Aeromonas veronii (LTA-Av) was superior with respect to conversions
and furthermore favored the anti-diastereoisomer
with moderate de values in most cases.42 The DTAs generally gave lower conversions and preferred the syn-diastereoisomers. The l-selective enzyme LTA-Av was employed for stereocomplementary aldol additions
to linear, branched and (hetero)aromatic substrates similar as the
SHMT from Streptococcus thermophilus (Scheme 10).

4 C–C-Bond Formation Leading to α-Hydroxyketones
4.1 Overview
α-Hydroxyketones represent
an ubiquitous structural motif with a range of applications relevant
for the fine chemical industry as well as for the pharmaceutical sector.
They widely occur in antidepressants, antifungal agents, antitumor
antibiotics (Olivomycin A) or inhibitors of farsenyl transferase (Kurasoin
A and B) or amyloid-β-protein (treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease).43 Additionally, they are important
synthetic intermediates for the preparation of diols or aminoalcohols.

ThDP-dependent enzymes are recognized as a powerful tool for the
preparation of enantiopure α-hydroxyketones via C–C-bond
formation.44 The key step in the catalytic
process involves the reaction of a donor substrate with the thiazolium
ring of the cofactor ThDP (Vitamin B1) to produce a highly
reactive intermediate via polarity reversal (Umpolung reaction). This
intermediate, often referred to as “activated aldehyde”,
is described by the mesomeric formulas of a 2α-carbanion and
an enamine (Scheme 11). The activated aldehyde-intermediate subsequently attacks a more
electrophilic “acceptor” species. If this acceptor is
an aldehyde, α-hydroxyketones with a sec-alcohols
moiety (sec-α-hydroxyketones) will be formed,
whereas ketones as acceptor yield α-hydroxyketones with a tert-alcohol functionality (tert-α-hydroxyketones).

Scheme 11 Acyloin Derivatives Bearing a sec-Alcohol (sec-α-Hydroxyketones)
Phenylacetylcarbinol derivatives
(PACs), 2-hydroxypropiophenone analogues (2-HPPs), benzoins, aliphatic
acyloins or δ-hydroxy-γ-keto acids are obtained depending
on the donor preference of the employed carboligase.

4.2 sec-α-Hydroxyketones/sec-Acyloins
Depending on the donor/acceptor and
the employed enzyme various products may be obtained such as phenylacetylcarbinol
derivatives (PACs), 2-hydroxypropiophenone analogues (2-HPPs), δ-hydroxy-γ-keto
acids, benzoins, or aliphatic acyloins. The latter can be formed by
cross-carboligations but mostly arise from homocoupling reactions
in which the enzyme uses a single substrate as donor (shown in red)
as well as acceptor (blue) (Scheme 11).

The synthetic utility of (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol was demonstrated in recently published two-step
one-pot cascades for the preparation of the (1R)-isomers
of nor(pseudo)ephedrine [N(P)E] (Scheme 12).45 Excellent
stereoselectivity for the corresponding phenylpropanolamines (ee 98−99%,
de 97–99%) was assured by coupling the (R)-selective
acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS-I) from E. coli either with a (R)- or (S)-selective
ω-transaminase (ω-TA) from various species. The synthesis
of (1R,2R)-norpseudoephedrine went
to completion and space-time yields of up to 26 g L–1 d–1 were reached.46 In an analogous reaction, the (R)-selective pyruvate
decarboxylase (PDC) from S. cerevisiae was used instead of AHAS-I.47 Due to
a lack of a highly (S)-selective carboligase, the
corresponding (1S)-isomers were accessed employing
enantiocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) instead.

Scheme 12 Two-Step
Cascade Involving (R)-Selective Carboligases
and Enantiocomplementary ω-TAs for the Synthesis of the (1R)-Isomers of Nor(pseudo)ephedrine [N(P)E]
More asymmetric cross carboligations of pyruvate
with a broad set
of aromatic acceptor aldehydes were recently performed with the cyclohexane-1,2-dione
hydrolase (CDH)48 from Azoracus sp. CDH turned out to be a powerful tool for the transformation
of several electron-rich and electron-deficient benzaldehydes into
highly enantioenriched (R)-PACs (ee 92–99%)
with up to quantitative conversions.49 Notably,
the enzyme also converted sterically demanding substrates, such as t-Bu-or i-Pr-substituted benzaldehydes
or 2-naphthaldehyde with >99% conversion and excellent ees (Scheme 13).

Scheme 13 Chiral sec-α-Hydroxyketones Obtained with
CDH or ApPDC Variants
Selected examples are shown.
Substrate loadings for CDH: acceptor (10 mM), pyruvate (25 mM), 48
h; ApPDC variants: acceptor (18 mM), 24–48
h.

Semipreparative scale biotransformation
of selected bulky-substrates
afforded enantiopure products with high isolated yields (87–90%).

CDH was also found to catalyze the formation of (S)-acetoin, a food additive found in many dietary products such as
butter, yoghurt, apples, among others, by either homocoupling of pyruvate
or acetaldehyde or cross-coupling reactions of pyruvate and acetaldehyde.
The aliphatic acetoin is thereby obtained with moderate to good conversions
and ees ranging from 87 to 95% depending on the reaction temperature.
Mechanistic studies utilizing 13C-labeled substrates further
revealed that CDH formed (S)-acetoin solely from
pyruvate in an acetolactate-independent pathway.50 This is in contrast to other studied ThDP-dependent enzymes
which showed an α-hydroxy-β-keto acid intermediate prior
to the formation of almost racemic acetoin.51 An alternative reaction pathway of the CDH is believed to explain
the obtained outstanding enantioselectivities.

Another extensively
investigated nondecarboxylative ThDP-dependent
carboligase is the (R)-selective benzaldehyde lyase
(BAL) from Pseudomonas fluorescens (see
also Scheme 6).52 BAL-catalyzed carboligations were used for a
kinetic resolution transforming preferentially one enantiomer of a
racemic α-chiral aldehyde to setup two chiral centers in one
reaction (Scheme 14).53 In the case in which benzaldehyde
served as donor, perfect enantioselectivities were obtained.

Diastereoselective Condensation of Benzaldehyde and
Racemic (±)-2-Methyl-Alkyl-Aldehydes Affording Enantiopure 2-HPP
Derivatives
n.r.: not reported.

The diastereoselectivity increased with increasing
chain length
of the coupled acceptor aldehyde. The authors explained this finding
by envisaging that the less sterically demanding (±)-2-methyl
butanal could be arranged in a favored and a disfavored manner in
the active-site, whereas the sterically more demanding (±)-2-methylpentanal
would dock exclusively in its favored position. In general, the syn-products were favored, while the diastereoselectivities
of the corresponding PAC-byproducts (formed when benzaldehyde is the
acceptor) were poor in all cases. Notably, if enantiopure (S)-2-methylbutanal was employed instead of the racemic precursor,
the corresponding PAC byproduct was formed with perfect diastereoselectivity.

Furthermore, the versatility of BAL was demonstrated by embedding
the biocatalyst in a one-pot two-step cascade (Scheme 15).54 In situ
oxidation of (biobased) aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes
by Hansenula sp. oxidase and a catalase for disproportionation
of hydrogenperoxide followed by the BAL-catalyzed C–C-bond
formation yielded optically pure 2-hydroxypropiophenone and analogues.
Short-chain aliphatic alcohols (methanol to butanol) were readily
accepted in the cascade, thereby achieving excellent enantioselectivities
(98–99%) and moderate to excellent conversions (15–99%)
of the final products. Reactions with longer-chain, branched, or allylic
alcohols however were not successful, except yielding quantitative
amounts of (R)-benzoin, as a result of the homocoupling
of benzaldehyde as an undesired side-reaction. Testing other oxidases
as well as investigating an organocatalytic approach with TEMPO for
the oxidation step failed to afford more complex aldehydes. In spite
of the low compatibility of BAL with oxidizing agents, BAL tolerated
several organic cosolvents (e.g., DMSO, MTBE, butanol, 2-MeTHF, etc.)
or deep-eutectic solvents.55 For instance,
(R)-benzoin was produced in buffer/2-MeTHF mixtures
(5% v/v) employing BAL (half-life 178 ± 8 h) with a productivity
of 10 g L–1 h–1.56

Hydrogen peroxide is disproportionated
by a catalase.

Benzoin served as precursor
for the preparation of benzil, a commonly
used photoinitiator in polymer synthesis. Whereas numerous biocatalytic
approaches for the direct preparation of (R)-benzoin
and analogues have been established in the past,57 enzymes catalyzing the formation of the respective (S)-enantiomers have been identified only very recently.
By tuning the substrate binding-site of a (S)-selective
variant of pyruvate decarboxylase from Acetobacter
pasteurianus (ApPDC) by rational
design, the direct enzymatic homocoupling of commercially available
benzaldehyde derivatives to yield optically active (S)-benzoins was achieved.58 An amino acid
sequence-based approach as well as analyzing the active-site characteristics
of both enzymes (BAL and ApPDC) allowed the creation
of a “chimeric enzyme” by combining the (S)-pocket of ApPDC-E469G and the large donor binding
site of the (R)-selective BAL. Consequently, meta-
and para-substituted (S)-benzoins with good conversions
(up to 97%) and high ee values (85−99%) were prepared. While
a triple variant (ApPDC-E469G/T384G/I468A) provided
products with high conversions but imperfect ee, the variant differing
at four amino acid positions (ApPDC-E469G/T348G/I468A/W543F)
displayed superior enantioselectivities and moderate conversions (Scheme 16). Moreover, selected
substrates were transformed on a preparative scale yielding product
concentrations of up to 4 g L–1.

Scheme 16 Direct Asymmetric
Synthesis of Meta- and Para-Substituted (S)-Benzoins
Catalyzed by Variants of the ThDP-Dependent
Pyruvate Decarboxylase from Acetobacter pasteurianus (ApPDC)
In contrast to the aforementioned carboligases, the ThDP-dependent
enzyme MenD accepts α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) as donor, thereby
accessing another type of sec-α-hydroxyketones
as products, namely, δ-hydroxy-γ-keto acids (Scheme 17). MenD from E. coli (EcMenD) is involved in the menaquinone
biosynthesis, where it catalyzes the 1,4-addition of α-ketoglutarate
(α-KG) to its natural substrate isochorismate.59 Apart from its physiological reaction, MenD was also found
to be an excellent catalyst for the (R)-selective
1,2-addition of α-KG to aromatic aldehydes to afford aromatic
δ-hydroxy-γ-keto acids with excellent ee values and conversions
(>99%), respectively.60 Besides exploiting
the excellent (R)-selectivity of MenD, the enzyme
was recently subjected to extensive engineering work in order to invert
its stereoselectivity. Consequently, the (S)-pocket
concept61 led to the design of several
powerful double variants, being able to preferentially convert meta-substituted
benzaldehydes to the corresponding (S)-δ-hydroxy-γ-keto
acids.62 Even more recently, MenD originating
from Bacillus subtilis (BsMenD) was similarly engineered toward (S)-selectivity
and several benzaldehydes were coupled to α-KG with moderate
to high conversions and improved enantioselectivities (compared to EcMenD variants, Scheme 17).63

4.3 tert-α-Hydroxyketones,
α-Hydroxy-1,3-Diketones, and α-Alkyl-α,β-Dihydroxyketones
The preparation of optically pure tertiary alcohols is generally
considered as a challenge in organic synthesis. This is mainly attributed
to the enhanced steric requirement at the prochiral quaternary carbon
atom which often leads to low asymmetric induction.

Additionally
to chemical methodologies,64 different
biocatalytic routes have been successfully established to yield enantioenriched
tertiary alcohols. Besides enzymatic kinetic resolution, reduction
of ketones or hydroxylation,65 the direct
C–C-bond formation represents an attractive option. In this
context, several ThDP-dependent enzymes were recently found to catalyze
the formation of tert-α-hydroxyketones accepting
ketones as acceptor.

The frequent occurrence of the tert-α-hydroxyketone
motif in numerous natural products, biologically active compounds
or components relevant for surface protections in the coating industry66 promoted the investigation of such ThDP-dependent
enzymes. Depending on the biocatalyst and substrates, two major pathways
can be distinguished: (i) asymmetric ketone-donor cross-couplings,
whereby pyruvate, butan-2,3-dione, acetoin or methylacetoin are ligated
to (activated) ketones or (ii) asymmetric ketone–ketone homocouplings
of 1,2-diketones yielding α-hydroxy-1,3-diketones (Scheme 18).

Routes toward tert-α-Hydroxyketones

(and a Prochiral Byproduct)
YerE: carboligase from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis; AAS: acetylacetoin synthase;
CDH: cyclohexane-1,2-dione hydrolase; Ao:DCPIP OR: acetoin:dichlorophenolindophenol
oxidoreductase.

The first reported enzyme
which was exploited for the preparation
of a broad range of cyclic and open-chain tert-α-hydroxyketones
(Scheme 18A) with
good conversions (20–99%) and high ee values (up to 96%) is
the ThDP-dependent flavoenzyme YerE from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.67 Although YerE relies on pyruvate as
donor substrate, several ketones, including 1,2-diketones and even
β-ketoesters were transformed on a preparative scale with reasonable
isolated yields (9–39%). At about the same time, crude extracts
of Bacillus licheniformis were reported
to catalyze a similar biotransformation of 1,2-diketones into α-hydroxy-1,3-diketones
(up to 62% yield and 91% ee) via homocoupling (Scheme 18B).68 Further
investigations have led to the identification of the ThDP-dependent
acetylacetoin synthase (AAS) as the involved biocatalyst. Subsequently,
the broad applicability of crude and partially purified AAS was demonstrated
in multiple reactions, including coupling of the AAS to the NADH-dependent
acetylacetoin reductase (AAR) to access syn-α-alkyl-α,β-dihydroxyketones
with high enantioselectivities (>95%) (Scheme 19).69 Interestingly,
the corresponding prochiral diketone byproducts were not reduced by
the strictly (S)-stereospecific AAR and could be
separated from the final products by flash chromatography. The AAS-AAR-combination
was used by the same group for the synthesis of the chiral green tea
flavor compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylnonane-2,4-dione.70 Furthermore, the stability of AAS was very recently demonstrated
by operating the enzyme in flow-mode fixed-bed microreactors. Reasonable
volumetric activities (3.5 U g–1) as well as the
long-term stability of the immobilized biocatalyst (up to 15 days)
have turned the enzyme into an attractive target for future applications.71

Crude Extracts
of Bacillus licheniformis Containing
the Acetylacetoin Synthase (AAS) and Acetylacetoin Reductase (AAR)
Another enzyme named acetoin:dichlorophenolindophenol
oxidoreductase
(Ao:DCPIP OR) was also described to catalyze a ThDP-dependent oxidative
cleavage of acetoin.72 In 2015, Ao:DCPIP
OR and AAS, both from Bacillus licheniformis, were heterologously expressed in E. coli, purified
and compared for their ability to catalyze the aforementioned cross-
and homoligations of several 1,2-diketones. Interestingly, both enzymes
showed remarkable similarities in terms of product composition and
enantioselectivities; however, it remains to be clarified whether
AAS and Ao:DCPIP OR are actually the same enzyme.73

The so-far hardly suppressed side-reaction in the
homocoupling
of 1,2-diketones (see Scheme 18B) could be successfully avoided by employing methylacetoin
(3-hydroxy-3-methyl-butan-2-one) as alternative donor for Ao:DCPIP
OR-catalyzed carboligations.

Apart from AAS and YerE, a double
variant of the already above-discussed
CDH was recently designed and applied for the preparation α-hydroxyketones
with a tert-alcohol function. While the WT-CDH solely
performs hydrolysis of its model substrate cyclohexane-2,3-dione to
6-oxohexanoic acid,48c the hydrolytic activity
was successfully knocked down by mutations at residues crucial for
the original cleavage activity (H28, N484).74 The double CDH-variant H28A/N484A was then able to perform a C–C-bond
formation between pyruvate and cyclohexane-2,3-dione, yielding the
corresponding cyclic tert-α-hydroxyketone with
88% ee (Scheme 20).75

Scheme 20 Reversing the C–C-Cleavage Activity
of CDH to C–C-Ligation
by Inserting Two Mutations at H28 and N484
CDH-variant H28A/N484A preferred pyruvate as donor substrate
(butan-2,3-dione
was only weakly accepted) and furthermore displayed a similar acceptor
tolerance as YerE and Ao:DCPIP OR. When comparing YerE, Ao:DCPIP OR,
and the CDH variant in terms of catalytic performance under optimized
conditions for a selected set of substrates, it turned out that the
CDH variant provided products with higher enantioselectivities while
the obtained conversions were generally lower than with the other
two enzymes (Scheme 21).

with
YerE, CDH-Variant H28A/N484A or Ao:DCPIP OR
Selected examples are shown.
Substrate concentrations for YerE: acceptor (20 mM), pyruvate (50
mM); CDH-variant: acceptor (20 mM), pyruvate (50 mM); Ao:DCPIP OR:

Interestingly, YerE and the CDH variant formed the
(S)-enantiomer using 3,4-hexandione as substrate
(Scheme 21, bottom
row – middle),
while the (R)-enantiomer was obtained with Ao:DCPIP
OR. Notably, the latter enzyme also showed excellent activity toward
2-oxopropanamide which has never been tested with any other ThDP-dependent
enzyme before. Despite still requiring optimizations to achieve generally
higher stereoselectivities, the biocatalytic toolbox for the preparation
of tertiary alcohols via direct C–C-bond formation evolves
as an alternative to chemical routes.

5 1,4-Dicarbonyls:
1,4-Diketones and γ-Keto
Acids
While ThDP-dependent carboligases are mostly known
for their ability
to catalyze a 1,2-addition of a ThDP-bound “activated aldehyde”
to the carbonyl moiety of an aldehyde or ketone, resulting in the
formation of an α-hydroxyketone (vide supra), selected members
of this enzyme family were also found to perform 1,4-additions.44a,44b This biocatalytic version of a Stetter reaction is feasible due
to the electron-poor C=C-double bond of the Michael acceptor
(shown in blue), hence allowing a donor (red) to attack the β-carbon
of the substrate (Scheme 22).

synthase from E. coli; SeAAS: ThDP-dependent carboligase
from Saccharopolyspora erythraea; HapD:
ThDP-dependent carboligase from Hahella chejuensis..

The enzyme PigD from Serratia
marcescens, the first identified “stetterase”,
adds (decarboxylated)
pyruvate (Pyr) to α,β-unsaturated ketones, therefore yielding
enantioenriched 1,4-diketones.76 Prompted
by this discovery as well as the importance of the 1,4-diketone products
as building blocks for heterocycle synthesis (Paal-Knorr), sequence-based
homology searches recently led to the identification of two new members
of the “stetterase-family”, namely, SeAAS from Saccharopolyspora erythraea and HapD from Hahella chejuensis.77 Both enzymes show similar enantioselectivities
as PigD (Scheme 23); conversions were sometimes lower and also the soluble expression
of these new enzymes remains to be improved.

or MenD
Selected examples are shown.
Substrate concentrations for PigD, SeAAS, HapD: acceptor
(20 mM), pyruvate (25 mM), reaction volume (1.5 mL), 24 h. Substrate
concentrations for MenD: acceptor (15 mM), α-KG (30 mM), 24
h.

Along with the classical “stetterases”,
the nonsequence
related ThDP-dependent MenD from E. coli, catalyzes
a Stetter-type addition of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to its
natural substrate isochorismate. First attempts to improve this 1,4-addition
activity toward β-substituted α,β-unsaturated acids
were limited to (2S,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate.
A focus has subsequently been set toward the 1,2-additions of α-KG
to various aromatic aldehydes, yielding δ-hydroxy-γ-keto
acids (vide supra).59b Investigations on
an extended substrate scope revealed that MenD indeed performs Stetter-type
reactions, thereby converting α-KG and acrylates and acrylonitrile
into γ-keto acids with moderate to good conversions (Scheme 23, bottom row).78 Although the acceptor scope is still very limited,
these results are a good starting point for further optimizations.

6 C–C Formation at Aromatic and Heteroaromatic
Carbons
6.1 Overview
The C–C-bond formation
reactions in this chapter include reactions on indole, aniline and
phenol moieties catalyzed by several different enzyme classes such
as lyases (chapter 6.2–6.4), transferases (6.5), and oxidoreductases
(6.6–6.9). For instance, the Pictet–Spengler reaction79 is catalyzed by strictosidine synthases80 condensing tryptamine and secologanin affording
(S)-strictosidine (chapter 6.2) and by norcoclaurine
synthases catalyzing the formation of (S)-norcoclaurine
from dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (chapter 6.3). Tyrosine
phenol lyase catalyzes the formation of tyrosine derivatives from
pyruvate, phenols, and ammonia (chapter 6.4). Regarding the group
of transferases, prenyltransferases from the dimethylallyltryptophane
synthase (DMATS) superfamily are reviewed catalyzing the transfer
of the isoprene unit from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) onto aromatic
ring systems such as indole or phenol moieties in a regioselective
fashion (chapter 6.5). SAM-dependent transferases for C–C-bond
formation or hydroxynitrile lyases were less investigated during the
previous years and have been reviewed elsewhere.2e

Finally, oxidoreductases perform C–C formation
at the expense of molecular oxygen. Examples of oxidoreductases are
laccases (chapter 6.6–6.8) and the berberine bridge enzyme
which perform inter- and intramolecular oxidative bond formations
preferentially on phenolic substrates (chapter 6.9).

In general,
different reaction types can be distinguished (Scheme 24): (i) intermolecular
reaction by attaching (functional) moieties onto the ring scaffold
with (Scheme 24A)
and without cyclization (Scheme 24B) as well as (ii) intramolecular cyclization reaction
(Scheme 24C).

6.2 Biocatalytic Pictet–Spengler Reaction
Leading to Tetrahydro-β-carbolines
Tetrahydro-β-carbolines
are indole alkaloids exhibiting strong biological activity; for example,
some of them are known as potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase and
thus find application in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.81 Strictosidine synthase (STR)79,80 catalyzes the Pictet–Spengler condensation of the natural
substrates tryptamine and the aldehyde secologanin to form (S)-strictosidine (Scheme 25). It is reported to be mainly restricted to close
derivatives of secologanin as aldehyde substrate but accepts various
substituted tryptamine derivatives.82 Nevertheless,
spectroscopic data indicated that the strictosidine synthase from Ophiorrhiza pumila might transform other aldehydes
at 1 mM substrate concentration.83

Scheme 25 Strictosidine and Derivatives Obtained via Strictosidine-Synthase-Catalyzed
Cyclization: (A) Natural Reaction of Tryptamine and Secologanin and
Recent Examples of Derivatives of the Aromatic Core; (B) Cascade Transforming
Prochiral Ketones to Optically Pure Amine Intermediates Which Were
Condensed with Secologanin to Various Indole Substituted 3-Methyl
Strictosidine Derivatives
In recent studies, preparative transformations have been
reported
by applying flow chemistry condensing tryptamine or 7-aza-tryptamine
with secologanin giving strictosidine (1.0 g, 73% yield) and 12-aza-strictosidine
(0.7 g, 50% yield) using immobilized enzyme (Scheme 25A).84 Additionally
1H-indole-ethanamine was accepted at 10 mM substrate concentration
to give access to strictosidine analogues harboring the piperazino[1,2-a]indole scaffold (Scheme 25A).85

Very recently,
a two-step biocatalytic cascade consisting of the
simultaneous amination of ketones employing ω-transaminases
and the Pictet–Spengler condensation with secologanin by STRs
gave access to (S)-strictosidine derivatives with
an additional stereogenic center at C3 of the tetrahydro-β-carboline
core (Scheme 25B).
By using stereocomplementary transaminases from Arthrobacter sp. and Silibacter pomeroyi, both
epimers were obtained with high diastereoseletivities.86 Protein engineering of the STR from Rauvolfia serpentina by a small focused library of
circular permutated variants demonstrated that the enzyme tolerates
termini relocation without loss of its overall structure and yielded
several active variants, however with lower activity toward the enzyme’s
natural substrates.87

6.3 Biocatalytic Pictet–Spengler Reaction
Leading to 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinolines
The 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline
structural motif can be found in several antitumor antibiotics.88 Norcoclaurine, a 1-benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline
alkaloid, was found to act as β2-adrenergic receptor agonist
used in the treatment of asthma and possesses also antiplatelet and
antithrombotic activity.89 The formation
of (S)-norcoclaurine, the precursor of all benzylisoquinoline
alkaloids, is catalyzed by norcoclaurine synthases (NCS) by stereoselective
C–C coupling of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (Scheme 26).

Scheme 26 Norcoclaurins
Synthase (NCS)-Catalyzed Pictet–Spengler Reaction
and Its Scope
Several studies on
the substrate scope of NCSs from Thalictrum flavum (TfNCS) and Coptis japonica (CjNCS2) revealed
a broad aldehyde substrate tolerance as both enzymes transform several
phenylacetaldehyde derivatives substituted with various electron-withdrawing
or -donating groups, heteroatoms, and aliphatic side chains.90 Notably, CjNCS2 also accepted
linear aliphatic aldehydes as well as α-substituted alkyl groups,
the latter however with lower activity90c while TfNCS accepted naphtha-1-ylacetaldehyde.90b In contrast to the aldehyde substrate, only
small variations on the dopamine substrate are allowed, as the meta-hydroxy moiety of dopamine is crucial for turnover.
Thus, metaraminol and 3-hydroxy-phenethylamine were accepted as non-natural
amine substrates.90a The exceptional tolerance
toward aldehyde substrates is consistent with docking studies performed
with the structure of TfNCS, which state that the
most favorable binding modes for reaction intermediates expose only
the R-group of the aldehyde to the solvent. The poor acceptance of
α-substituted aldehydes by TfNCS can be rationalized
by steric hindrance and was improved by the variant L76A, which improved
the activity toward (S)- and (R)-citronellal.91 To prove the applicability of NCSs, optically
active 1-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines were synthesized
on preparative scale (10 mg/mL) affording the products in good to
excellent conversions (86–99%) and high optical purity (95–98%
ee).90c By simultaneously combining the
norcoclaurine synthase with a transaminase, selected (S)-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids were prepared via a cascade (Scheme 27).92 Starting from the amine, a fraction of the amine was deaminated
using a transaminase and pyruvate as formal oxidant giving the second
substrate for the norcoclaurine synthase, the aldehyde. Conversions
up to 86% were obtained.

Substrate To Prepare Benzylisoquinoline
Alkaloids
6.4 p-Vinylphenols Using a Lyase
in the C–C Forming Step
para-Vinylphenols
are widely used as building blocks of polymers, which can be used
for advanced materials as for example chemical or biological sensors93 or flame retardants.94

A biocatalytic cascade reaction transforming para-substituted
phenol derivatives into the corresponding para-vinylphenols
was set up employing three simultaneous enzymatic steps (Scheme 28).95 In the first step a tyrosine phenol lyase (TPL)96 from Citrobacter freudii catalyzed the C–C coupling between phenol derivatives and
pyruvate in the presence of ammonia yielding tyrosine derivatives.
The obtained intermediate is deaminated by tyrosine ammonia lyase
(TAL) from Rhodobacter spharoides to
give a coumaric acid derivative which is finally decarboxylated by
ferulic acid decarboxylase (FAD) from Enterobater sp. A variety of 2- or 3-substituted phenols as well as 2,3-disubstituted
phenols were quantitatively transformed giving high isolated yields
on a preparative scale. Tyrosine phenol lyase has also recently been
used in a cascade starting from substituted benzenes, which were enzymatically
hydroxylated to the corresponding phenol derivative and then coupled
to pyruvate yielding tyrosine derivatives.97 By combining tyrosine phenol lyase with a decarboxylase tyramine
was obtained.98

6.5 Prenylated Indoles and Phenols
As
review articles on prenyltransferases (PTs) were published recently,99 only a brief overview is given on selected reactions
with regard to substrate and alkyl donor. For instance, the tyrosine
O-prenyltransferases SirD (Leptospheria maculans) and TyrPT (Aspergillus niger) were
able to catalyze the C7-prenylation of l-tryptophan derivatives
(Scheme 29A).100 This is the natural reaction carried out by
the tryptophan C7-prenyltransferase 7-DMATS from A. fumigatus, which accepted also tyrosine and derivatives as substrates by catalyzing
the O-prenylation of the phenolic OH of tyrosine
and its derivatives.101 In contrast, C3-prenylation
of tyrosine can be observed by the tryptophan C4-prenyltransferase
FgaPT2 (A. fumigatus). The enzyme was subsequently
significantly improved by the single point mutation K174F, exerting
>200% relative activity compared to the wild type (Scheme 29B).102

Scheme 29 Selected Recent Examples of Prenylation: (A) Tyrosine O-Prenyltransferases SirD (Leptospheria maculans) and TyrPT (Aspergillus niger) Catalyzed
C7-Prenylation of l-Tryptophan Derivatives; (B) C3-Prenylation

by FgaPT2; (D) C4-Prenylation of 1-Naphthol by the Prenyltransferase
BAE61387 from A. oryzae; (E) Prenyltransferase
from A. fumigatus Active on Nonaromatic
Carbon Atoms
In contrast to the
rather high flexibility of prenyltransferases
toward their aromatic prenyl acceptors, a strict specificity regarding
their prenyl donor has been assumed. Nevertheless, previous studies
already revealed that some prenyltransferases from the dimethylallyltryptophane
synthase superfamily also accept unnatural alkyl donors with similar
structures as the natural prenyl donor dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).
Recently, however, five different PTs were found to be able to catalyze
the benzylation of their preferred substrates using benzyl diphosphate
as donor substrate. The best results were achieved by the l-tryptophan prenyltransferase FgaPT2, giving conversions of up to
83% (400 μg/mL enzyme, substr. conc.: 1 mM tryptophan, 2 mM
benzyl diphosphate, 16 h) for the C5-benzylation of l-tryptophan
(Scheme 29C). Furthermore,
also several tryptophan derivatives were accepted and benzylated either
at the C5 or C6 position.103 The prenyltransferase
BAE61387 from A. oryzae catalyzes the prenylation
of hydroxynaphthalenes and was shown to accept not only prenyl but
also geranyl and farnesyl as alkyl donors.104 It selectively prenylated C4 of 1-naphthol (Scheme 29D) and 1,7-dihydroxynaphtahalene as well as C3 of 2,7-dihydroxynaphthalene,
thus, the para- and ortho-positon of the hydroxyl group of the same
benzene ring, respectively.

Additionally, a prenyltransferase
active on nonaromatic carbon
atoms has been identified in A. fumigatus. Subsequently,
it also produced a novel α-prenylindolylbutenone from indolylbutenone
as prenyl acceptor (Scheme 29E) [conversion of 46% in the case of (E)-4-(1H-indol-3-yl)but-3-en-2one].105

6.6 Oxidative C–C Coupling To Form Carbazoles
by a Laccase
Carbazoles exhibit not only a large variety
of biological activities such as antimicrobial, anticancer, or anti-inflammatory
properties,106 but they are also interesting
building blocks for luminescent polymers or photovoltaic devices.107 A symmetric carbazole derivative was the product
of a biotransformation of a meta, para-disubstituted arylamine using
the laccase CotA from Bacillus subtilis (Scheme 30).108 This intramolecular oxidative coupling led
to the formation of a carbazole framework rather than phenazine or
phenoxazinone frameworks, which were reported for related substrates.
After the biotransformation of 2,4-diamindiphenylamine with CotA,
the insoluble product was isolated as dark purple solid.

Scheme 30 Formation

6.7 Oxidative C–C Coupling To Form Dimerized
Phenols by a Laccase
Biphenols such as the well-known bisphenol
A or 4,4′-biphenol are known for their cytotoxic and estrogenic
activities, while 2,2′-biphenol possesses anti-inflammatory
properties.109 Owing to their biological
activities, biphenols are for example used as building blocks for
herbicides.110 The commercially available
laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila (Novozym 51003) catalyzed the selective oxidative C–C homocoupling
reaction of ortho- and para-diphenolic as well as monophenolic compounds.
Especially coupling reactions of 2,6-disubstituted phenols showed
to be highly selective and yielded symmetrical products (Scheme 31). The applicability
was demonstrated on a multigram scale transforming 2,6-diisopropyl
phenol (10 g) with 0.01 mol % biocatalyst loading, which afforded
the product in 70% isolated yield. The oxidation product can easily
be reduced to the antibacterial agent dipropophol.111

6.8 Oxidative C–C Coupling To Form Benzo[b]furans
by a Laccase
Benzo[b]furan derivatives are target molecules
for the pharmaceutical industry due to their wide range of biological
activities, as they act as antifungal,112 antimicrobial113 and antitumor agents.114

Catechols were transformed with 1,3-dicarbonyls
to benzo[b]furans by a Michael addition reaction with in situ generation
of o-quinone employing a commercially available laccase
from Myceliophthora thermophila (Suberase)
(Scheme 32).115 Besides linear 1,3-dicarbonyls also cyclohexane-1,3-dione
derivatives were accepted which were substituted by methyl-, dimethyl-
or phenyl-groups at the C5 position (meta to both carboxy moieties).
This approach eliminated the use of Lewis acid and lipase, which were
used in previous methods,116 and afforded
benzo[b]furan products with potent cytostatic effects against several
cancer cell lines.

6.9 Oxidative C–C Coupling To Yield Berbines
by the Berberine Bridge Enzyme
Berbines are plant alkaloids
from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids and
have a long history of medicinal use. They show diverse biological
activities such as antimicrobial117 or
anti-inflammatory118 effects. Furthermore,
it has been demonstrated that berbines possess central nervous system
activities and might act as an herbal antidepressant119 as well as protectant against Alzheimer’s disease.120 (S)-Scoulerine, the branch
point intermediate for the pathway leading to berberine, is synthesized
from (S)-reticuline by intramolecular, oxidative
C–C-bond formation of the so-called berberine-bridge by the
flavin-dependent berberine bridge enzyme (BBE).

Various racemic
non-natural substrates were subjected to kinetic resolution via enantioselective
oxidative ring closure by BBE from California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) yielding the (S)-berbine derivatives and the unreacted (R)-substrates
both in excellent optical purity and in good to excellent isolated
yields (Scheme 33A).121 The maximal conversion levels of 50% were reached
with perfect enantioselecitvity of the enzyme (E > 200).
The applicability of the enzyme was demonstrated employing BBE in

optically pure products.

Enantiomers of Benzylisoquinolines to Optically Pure Berbine Derivatives
To overcome the limitation
of a kinetic resolution of the BBE-catalyzed
C–C coupling, a deracemization process was developed employing
simultaneous kinetic resolution and stereoinversion (Scheme 33B). A variant of the monoamine
oxidase from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N
variant D11) was utilized to oxidize the (R)-amine
substrate not transformed by BBE to the corresponding achiral iminium
intermediate. The latter was nonstereoselectively reduced with morpholine·BH3, which did not inhibit the BBE unlike other reducing agents.
The redox cascade of MAO/BBE/borane could be performed stepwise or
in a concurrent fashion and yielded the optically pure (S)-product with conversions of up to 98%. The applicability of this
deracemization process was demonstrated by preparative scale biotransformations
(150–165 mg substrate).122

7 Saturated Carbo- and Heterocycles Obtained by
Squalene-Hopene Cyclase
Terpenes and the related functionalized
terpenoids are composed
of differing numbers of isoprene units and represent a highly abundant
class of natural products acting as flavors, hormones, or pigments.
The large diversity of these compounds can be attributed to terpene
cyclases, which catalyze the cyclization reaction of terpene backbones
to cyclic terpenoids. The one-step poly cyclization reaction of squalene
to the pentacyclic hopene, for example, is catalyzed by squalene-hopene
cyclase (SHC), whereby their mode of action resembles a Brønsted
acid catalyst (Scheme 34). It has already been demonstrated that the substrate scope of SHCs
is not limited to its natural substrate squalene, as several truncated
analogues were accepted as already summarized in a review.123

Scheme 34 Cyclization Reactions of Squalene by Squalene-Hopene
Cyclase (SHC)
to the Pentacyclic Terpenes Hopene and Hopanol
Recently, also functionalized isoprene backbones
were identified
as substrates for several (engineered) SHCs (Table 1). The SHCs AasSHC (Alicyclobacillus
acidocaldarius) and ZmoSHC1 (Zymomonas
mobilis) also accepted substrates which are shortened
in their polyisoprene backbone (C16–C13) and functionalized
by a hydroxy, carboxy, or keto group. These substrates were converted
to bi- or triheterocyclic compounds such as cyclic ethers, lactones,
and enol ethers (entries 1–5).124 Mutagenesis studies on AasSHC and a SHC from Zymomonas
mobilis (ZMO-1548 gene product) further expanded the
substrate scope toward citronellal and geraniol (entries 6–8).
Introduction of the single amino acid exchange F486C in ZMO-1548 as
well as other SHCs from Z. mobilis, A. pasteurianus, B. japonicum, and A. acidocaldarius led to citronellal cyclase activity while squalene cyclization was
reduced (entry 8). The most remarkable results with regard to stereopreference
and conversion of rac-citronellal were obtained with
ZMO-1548 with the highest ratio of isopurgenol to neo-isopurgenol formation and ZMO-0872 (Z. mobilis)
and a total conversion of 75% respectively.125 Mutations introduced on several sites in the AacSHC allowed cyclization
of geraniol, 6,7-epoxygeraniol and citronellal, giving rise to cyclogeraniol
and isopurgenol products. Notably, a variant was generated (I261A),
which was highly selective for (S)-citronellal and
led to the formation of (−)-iso-isopurgenol
with a selectivity of 99%.126

8 Cyclopropanation
of Olefins and Olefination
of Aldehydes
Since the cyclopropanation of olefins does not
occur in nature
but has been described for transition-state metal catalysis,127 P450 enzymes were engineered to perform this
reaction stereoselectively128 using diazoacetate
as non-natural reagent (Scheme 35A). While hemin on its own produced mainly the racemic E-product for the cyclopropanation of styrene derivatives,
a variant (P411BM3-CIS) showed preference for the Z-product (Scheme 35A). P411 enzymes are obtained by an exchange of the proximal
cysteine-ligand of the iron to a serine to facilitate reduction to
catalytic active Fe2+.129 Ees
up to 75% were reached for the E-product and up to
87% ee for the Z-isomer using evolved enzymes. It
is worth mentioning that the introduction of a single additional mutation
(I263A) in P411BM3-CIS reversed the diastereoselectivity
again to the initial E-preference. Related transformations
were achieved employing engineered myoglobin.130 Incorporating a threonine (T268) to alanine mutation into
a panel of P450 scaffolds, enantioselective catalysts for all possible
diastereomers in the model reaction of styrene with ethyl diazoacetate
were identified.131

One variant (P450BM3-HStar T268A-C400H-L437W-V78M-L181
V), possessing the axial cysteine changed to a histidine thereby increasing
the reduction potential even further, was used to catalyze the cyclopropanation
of acrylamides (Scheme 35B).132

Similar transformations
were catalyzed by an artificial metalloenzyme
formed by the incorporation of a dirhodium catalyst into the engineered
prolyl oligopeptidase scaffold Pfu POP-ZA4-HFF-1 from Pyrococcus furiosus (Scheme 35C). The
construct accepted a range of styrene and donor–acceptor carbene
precursors yielding 14–73% of the desired cyclopropanation
products with up to 92% ee.133

Following
the concept of engineering heme-containing proteins to
catalyze non-natural reactions, the variant Mb(F43 V,V68F) of sperm
whale myoglobin was found to catalyze the olefination of benzaldehyde
derivatives with α-diazo esters in the presence of AsPh3 (Scheme 35D). The catalyst exhibited excellent diastereoselectivity for the E-products (up to >99% de) as well as high chemoselectivity
toward olefination over carbine dimerization. In general, electron-deficient
benzaldehydes were less reactive than their electron-rich counterparts
and conversions never exceeded 50% in spite of the high TONs (up to
3400) that were observed.134

9 C–C-Bond-Forming Enzymes To Be Exploited
in the Future
While the previous chapters presented enzymatic
reactions which
have already been exploited for organic synthesis transforming non-natural
substrates, the focus in this section is on promising enzymes which
were either just recently discovered or their non-natural substrate
scope needs to be tested or further engineering is required prior
to application. Promiscuous activity of enzymes e.g. lipases for C–C-bond
formation, is summarized in recent reviews.2c,135 Additionally the design of artificial metal enzymes like for Diels–Alder
reactions or Friedel–Crafts alkylations may gain impact.135,136

9.1 Cyclases Transforming Squalene
Although
several studies have focused on the squalene-hopene cyclase and its
substrate promiscuity, enzymes cyclizing squalene to other cyclic
terpenes have been identified but barely investigated with regard
to non-natural substrate scope and applicability in biocatalytic processes
(Scheme 36). For instance,
squalene is also the natural substrate of the migrated hopene synthases
CPH and CPFa from Colysis pothifolia, which catalyze the cyclization to hop-17(21)-ene and fern-9(11)-ene,
respectively. The activity of these two enzymes could be interconverted
by introducing one single amino acid exchange in each case (CPH Q276
V and CPFa V281Q), thereby identifying the amino acid residues responsible
for controlling the number of 1,2-hydride and methyl shifts in the
mechanism.137 Furthermore, the tetraprenyl-β-curcumene
cyclase from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTC)
is capable of converting squalene into onoceranoxide via a bicyclic
intermediate. Furthermore, a two-step reaction of squalene with the
AasSHC variant D377C and BmeTC afforded (+)-ambrein, the main constituent
of ambergris, which is used in perfume production, however in low
yields (3.4%).138 Finally, it has been
shown that the natural product of SHC, hopene, can be further utilized
by tetrahymanol synthase (THS) from Methylomicrobium
alcaliophilum, yielding the sterol surrogate tetrahymanol.139

9.2 C–C Ring Closure Reactions in Terpenoid
and Alkaloid Biosyntheses
In this subsection, the major focus
was placed on C–C-bond formation observed in ring-closing reactions
in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and alkaloids.

The biosynthetic
gene cluster from Solanum lycopersicon, which catalyzes the synthesis of the diterpenoid lycosantalonol,
was reconstructed in E. coli. Cyclization of (Z,Z,Z)-nerylneryl diphosphate
by the terpene synthase SlTPS21 generates lycosantalene, a tricyclene
core ring structure with a neryl side chain, of which the cis double bond is in vivo transformed to an α-hydroxy
keto moiety yielding lycosantalonol (Scheme 37).140

Two terpene synthases
which were active on farnesyl diphosphate
were identified in Valeriana officinalis: VoTPS7 catalyzes the cyclization to germacrene C, whereas VoTPS1
synthesizes valerena-1,10-diene, which was verified by recombinant
overexpression in E. coli and yeast (Scheme 38).141 Both intermediates are further converted in the biosynthesis to
valerone and valerenic acid, two bioactive terpenoids found in the
herbal preparations of Valeriana officinalis.

The conversion of (−)-yatein to (−)-deoxypodophyllotoxin
is catalyzed by a 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD)
from Podophyllum hexandrum (mayapple),
closing the core cyclohexane ring of the aryltetralin scaffold (Scheme 39).142 Ten enzymes—six involved in the conversion
of coniferyl alcohol to (−)-podophyllooxin—were recombinantly
coexpressed in Nicotiana banthamiana (tobacco), enabling the synthesis of (−)-4′-desmethylepipodophyllotoxin,
the immediate precursor of etoposide, which is used in chemotherapy
regimens.

The halogenated polycycles
merochlorin A and B are produced by
the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain CNH-189
and feature unique ring systems–a bicycle[3.2.1]octadione and
a 6–5–5-fused tricycle (Scheme 40). The final step in the biosynthesis is
catalyzed by the vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase Mcl24 and involves
a site-selective naphthol chlorination, followed by oxidative dearomatization
and terpene cyclization.143 This reaction
sequence has already inspired the development of a chemical counterpart,
where premerochlorin is treated with N-chlorosuccinimide
in the presence of two equivalents of triethylamine, affording a product
mixture of merochlorin derivatives in 30% yield. The selectivity profile
of the chemical and the enzymatic oxidative cyclization however is
inverted, as Mcl24 chlorinates the naphthol prior to cyclization whereas
the chemical synthesis used prefers the reversed order.144

The biosynthesis
of ergot alkaloids involves the common intermediate
chanoclavine-I, which is produced from tryptophane and dimethylallylpyrophosphate
over three steps involving four enzymes. Deletion experiments in Aspergillus fumigatus and Claviceps
purpurea indicated that the last step might be catalyzed
by two enzymes—EasE and EasC—involving a cyclization
step of N-methyl-4-(dimethylallyl)tryptophan (Scheme 41). The mechanism
of this reaction remains unknown; however, similarities of EasC to
peroxisomal catalases and EasE to berberine bridge enzymes have been
recognized. Chanoclavine-I was produced in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae by expression of genes from Aspergillus japonicus (dmaW, easE, and easC) and Aspergillus
fumigatus (easF); however, only low
titers of 0.75 mg L–1 were observed.145 Additionally, the biosynthetic pathway for
cycloclavine synthesis—a complex ergot alkaloid containing
a cyclopropyl moiety—was reconstructed in S. cerevisiae by expressing four additional genes from A. japonicus (easD, easA, easG, and easH), which enabled synthesis of the desired
product in final titers of 529 mg L–1 by fed-batch
fermentation.146

9.3 Redox-Enzymes
and a Pd-Suzukiase Leading to
Biaryls
Axially chiral biaryls are found as motif in natural
products and are also of interest for synthetic chemistry, as for
example, BINAP and BINOL, which serve as chiral auxiliaries or ligands
of chiral catalysts. In nature, the generation of these compounds
usually involves oxidative coupling of two phenol moieties by, for
example, laccases, peroxidases, or cytochrome P450 enzymes (Scheme 42),147 but also, coupling of pyrroles by flavin-dependent
enzymes has been observed.148 While P450
enzymes are able to produce optically active products, laccases and
peroxidases catalyze the formation of radicals but not the actual
C–C coupling, which results in racemic products. However, regio-
and stereoselectivity for laccase reactions can be induced by the
presence of a dirigent protein (DIR),149 which binds specifically the radical intermediates but is not catalytically
active.

Scheme 42 Asymmetric C–C Coupling of Phenols Leading
to Biaryls or Other
Dimers Employing P450 Enzymes or Laccases in the Presence of a Dirigent
Protein
Recently, the dirigent
protein GHDIR4 was discovered in Gossypium hirsutum var. marie-galante and purified after expression
in transgenic plant cells. The recombinant
protein was successfully employed to the bimolecular radical coupling
of hemigossypol by laccase (Trametes versicolor) obtaining (P)-(+)-gossypol in >80% ee.150 Dirigent proteins not only control the formation
of biaryls but also the coupling reaction of coniferyl alcohol to
pinoresinol such as the proteins identified in Arabidopsis
thaliana (AtDIR5, AtDIR6) and Schizandra
chinensis (ScDIR). The proteins were heterologously
expressed in insect and plant cells, respectively. Both AtDIR5 and
AtDIR6 afforded (−)-pinoresinol (70% ee and 36% ee respectively)
upon incubation with laccase (T. versicolor) and the natural substrate, coniferyl alcohol, while ScDIR led to
the formation of the antipode (+)-pinoresionol (60% ee). By generating
a variant of ScDIR harboring a short region of AtDIR6, the stereoselectivity
of the enzyme was reversed, allowing first insights in regio-controlling
coupling selectivity.151

In addition
to the dirigent proteins, a P450 enzyme catalyzing
the direct regio- and stereoselective oxidative coupling of demethylsiderin
to (P)-orlandin, a precursor of (P)-(+)-kotanin, was identified in Aspergillus niger. The genetic cluster for the biosynthesis of kotanin consisting
of a polyketide synthase (KtnS), an O-methyltransferase
(KtnB) and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (KtnC) were identified.152 Similar gene clusters were furthermore found
in other bicoumarin-producing fungi including Aspergillus
flavus, A. alliaceus, and A. oryzae but also in Emericella desertorum. The P450 enzyme of the latter
(DesC) as well as KtnC were heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae and employed to phenol coupling reactions in vivo by feeding 7-demethylsiderin, the precursor of (P)-orlandin and (M)-desertorin A; however,
only partial conversions of the substrate was observed (3–7%
and 35–55% at 0.5 and 0.05 mM substrate concentration, respectively).
Although both enzymes catalyze the homocoupling of 7-demethylsiderin,
they differ in their regioselectivity, as KtnC catalyzes the symmetric
dimerization to P-orlandin while DesC affords the
asymmetric dimer M-desertorin A. Other monomeric
coumarins were not accepted by either of the enzymes, indicating a
stringent substrate specificity of both “bicoumarin synthases”.153 Gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis
of axially chiral biaryl compounds are not only present in fungi and
plants but also in bacteria, since three of these clusters were identified
in Streptomyces species. The P450 enzyme JulI was
heterologously expressed in E. coli and successfully
employed to C–C coupling reactions of julichrome Q6. Genome analysis of different Streptomycis strains
indicated the presence of similar gene clusters.154

A different approach made use of an artificial Pd-dependent
metal
enzyme. Anchoring a biotinylated monophosphine palladium complex within
a streptavidin scaffold afforded a stereoselective catalyst applicable
for C–C-bond formation according to the well know Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction.155 Consequently,
the artificial enzyme was named “Suzukiase”. Using an
evolved protein, a variety of atropisomeric biaryls were obtained
with up to 90% ee (Scheme 43). TONs were in general in the range of 80 up to 160. While
the presence of a phenolic moiety is required for the P450 or laccase-catalyzed
reactions, the Suzuki–Miyaura needs one substrate activated
by boronic acid and one by halogen.

Aryl Coupling Using a Pd-Dependent Artificial “Suzukiase”
9.4 Pyruvate
Aldolases for the Preparation of
4-Hydroxy-2-oxoacids
The versatility of DHA(P)-dependent
aldolases such as FSA, FruA, or RhuA has been proven detailed in a
previous chapter. A second class of aldolases, namely, the pyruvate
aldolases are currently subject to extensive engineering studies.
Naturally, these enzymes catalyze the retro aldol cleavage of a 4-hydroxy-2-oxoacid
skeleton into pyruvate and an aldehyde (Scheme 44). The synthetic direction of this reaction
is particularly interesting since the enzymes are independent of phosphorylated
donors and the formed chiral 4-hydroxy-oxoacid products occur in a
variety of natural products with antimicrobial properties.156 In this context, the 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate
(KDPG) aldolases157 from E. coli and a closely related isoform from Thermatoga maritima as well as the BphI aldolase from Burkholderia xenovorans(158) are the most important representatives
among these catabolic enzymes.

Scheme 44 Pyruvate-Aldolase-Catalyzed C–C-Bond
Cleavage/Formation of
4-Hydroxy-Oxoacids
KDPG aldolases
from E. coli and Thermatoga maritima and the BphI aldolase from Burkholderia xenovorans are in the focus of current engineering research in order to widen
their substrate specificity.

Recently, important
progress has been made in terms of active-site
remodeling of the EcKDPG in order to gain highly
efficient mutants with enhanced substrate specificity.159 By combining the two mutations S184L and T161S,
both crucial to substrate recognition and stereocontrol, respectively,
a powerful double mutant (EcKDPG-T161S/S184L) evolved
which is able to cleave the non-natural substrate (4S)-2-keto-4-hydroxy-4-(2′-pyridyl)butyrate (S-KHPB) with 450-fold improved kcat/KM-values compared to the wild type. This corresponds
to TON of 240 s–1 for S-KHPB which
is approximately 3 times higher than that of the WT-enzyme for its
natural substrate KDPG (83 s–1). Similarly, the kcat/KM value for
cleaving 2-keto-4-hydroxyoctonoate (KHO) by a TmKDPG-A30
V single mutant was improved by 25-fold (compared to the WT) by directed
evolution approaches.160 While the native
BphI-aldolase exhibits strict (S)-selectivity over
the stereogenic center at C4, which is created in the natural product
(4S)-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate [(S)-HOPA], the stereoselectivity was successfully inverted to (R) by rational design.161 Several
active-site residues, namely, L89, L87, and Y290 are key to substrate
recognition and also determine the stereoselectivty of the enzyme.162 By combining variants (Y290F with either L87N
or L87W), two BphI double variants with exclusive (R)-stereoselectivity were created for the first time. Although the
catalytic efficiencies of BphI-L87N/Y290F and BphI-L87W/Y290F were
∼40-fold lower for (R)-HOPA compared to the
cleavage efficiency of WT-BphI for (S)-HOPA, the
novel enzymes are able to synthesize (4R)-hydroxy-oxoacids
with up to eight carbons in length and good stereoselectivity, as
confirmed by polarimetric analysis.161

10 Conclusion and Outlook
Over the last five
years, tremendous advances have been achieved
in the field of biocatalytic C–C-bond formation applicable
for organic synthesis. This is especially true for enzymatic reactions
(i) which have previously been considered as difficult or exotic due
to the requirement of special activation of the substrate (e.g., by
phosphorylation), (ii) and/or due to limited substrate scope or (iii)
which were not known, yet. Identification of novel enzymes and enzyme
engineering163 helped to overcome many
limitations. Although there is a huge potential in using the biocatalytic
toolbox to cut short and simplify organic synthetic routes, its broad
applicability is only recognized slowly by synthetic chemists. Thus,
the area of enzymatic C–C-bond formation is underused, probably
as a result of a lack of awareness of how they might be used to construct
organic molecules.164 This might be due
to the fact that almost every selective transformation requires a
specific enzyme, depending on the substrate. Due to the high chemo-
and stereoselectivity of enzymes, a universal catalyst (e.g., for
all aldol reactions) is therefore elusive. Thus, a specific C–C-bond
formation with desired perfect stereoselectivity calls very often
for a unique enzyme.

C–C-bond formations are ubiquitously
found in nature for
the stereoselective assembling of small building blocks to bigger
molecules. Deduced from the huge number of different natural products,
many different C–C-bond formation reactions are realized in
nature, for which the enzyme responsible was not identified yet. These
enzymes “just” need to be identified and applied to
opening novel synthetic routes. Enzyme engineering might be requested
to allow higher substrate loads and gain better activity. It can be
expected that the set of stable enzymes performing unique C–C-bond
formations not achievable with established metal-/organo-catalysts
will expand significantly in the future. This will enable efficient
short synthetic routes to the target molecules via novel (stereoselective)
transformations.
