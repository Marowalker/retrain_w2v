Herein
we report the manganese-catalyzed C–C bond-forming
reactions via α-alkylation of ketones, amides, and esters, using
primary alcohols. β-Alkylation of secondary alcohols by primary
alcohols to obtain α-alkylated ketones is also reported. The
reactions are catalyzed by a (iPr-PNP)Mn(H)(CO)2 pincer complex under mild conditions in the presence of (catalytic)
base liberating water (and H2 in the case of secondary
alcohol alkylation) as the sole byproduct.

Carbon–carbon bond formation
represents one of the most important synthetic methodologies in organic
chemistry. A classical route of carbon–carbon bond formation
involves nucleophilic substitution reactions using an organometallic
reagent and an organic electrophile. Transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions have made great progress in C–C bond formation. However,
traditional alkylations usually require environmentally unfriendly
organic or organometallic coupling partners and large amounts of bases,
and they generate copious waste.1

Recent catalysis is aimed at cheaper, greener, and sustainable
methodologies. Therefore, development of a practical, green, and atom-economical
alkylation process for the formation of C–C bonds is highly
desirable. In recent years, transition-metal complexes have been developed
as catalysts for dehydrogenation of alcohols to the corresponding
carbonyl compounds, which subsequently undergo condensation with a
CH-acidic compound followed by hydrogen autotransfer to form α-alkylated
products.2,3 This so-called redox neutral “hydrogen
borrowing methodology” has attracted increasing attention for
C–C bond formation reactions because of its atom-economy (Scheme 1).2,4 Only
water is released in these reactions, rendering them green or sustainable.

Scheme 1 Transition-Metal-Catalyzed C-Alkylation via Borrowing Hydrogen Methodology
Moreover, use of alcohols as
starting materials for C–C
bond formation processes is attractive, because they are cheap, easy
to handle and store, and are a renewable alternative to petroleum-based
compounds. In the past few years, there has been a growing interest
in replacing homogeneous catalysts based on noble metals by earth-abundant
base metal complexes.5,6 This is due to the higher cost
of precious metals, lower abundance, and potential higher toxicity.
In this respect, application of manganese complexes in (de)hydrogenation
reactions is an attractive goal;7 manganese
is the third most earth-abundant transition metal on earth crust after
iron and titanium.7b Indeed, hydrogenation
of ketones,7h−7q nitriles,8 esters,9 CO2,10 and amides11 catalyzed by manganese complexes has been reported
in recent years by several groups including ours.

Substantial
efforts are also made in manganese-catalyzed dehydrogenation
reactions. We reported dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines
to give imines,12a catalyzed by a pincer
Mn-PNP complex 2 (Figure 1). Several other reports on Mn-catalyzed dehydrogenation
reactions appeared subsequently.12b,12c,13 Recently, N-alkylation of amines using alcohols,14a−14c and catalytic upgrading of ethanol to 1-butanol14d,14e via “borrowing hydrogen” were reported.

Figure 1 Manganese pincer
complexes employed in this work.

We reported the Mn-catalyzed N-formylation of amines using
methanol,15a and deoxygenation of alcohols,15b catalyzed by MnPNP pincer complex 1 (Figure 1). Very
recently, we demonstrated Mn-catalyzed synthesis of N-substituted
hydrazones by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and hydrazines
catalyzed by a MnPNN pincer complex,16 as
well as dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines to form amides,17 and that of diols and amines to form cyclic
imides using complex 3.18 We
also reported the unprecedented α-olefination of nitriles using
alcohols catalyzed by the manganese complex 1.19

Mn-pincer complex catalyzed α-alkylation
reactions of ketones
was reported by Beller20 using primary
alcohols (140 °C, 2 mol % catalyst, 5 mol % base). Very recently,
while this paper was in preparation, Maji reported a limited scope
α-alkylation of arylketones by benzyl alcohol derivatives under
similar conditions, catalyzed by an undefined Mn complex generated
in situ.21 We now report that complex 1 is an effective catalyst for α-alkylation of ketones,
nonactivated amides, and esters by primary alcohols. Complex 1 also catalyzes β-alkylation of secondary alcohols
by primary alcohols to obtain α-alkylated ketones (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Base-Metal-Catalyzed
C–C Bond-Forming Reactions by α
and β Alkylation
To the best of our knowledge, α-alkylation of activated22 and nonactivated23 esters and of activated24 and unactivated25 amides was reported using Ir and Ru complexes.
The only base-metal-catalyzed C-alkylation of esters and nonactivated
amides was reported by Kempe using a Co complex.26

At the outset, we explored the reaction of acetophenone
and benzyl
alcohol as model substrates. Reaction of benzyl alcohol (1 mmol) with
acetophenone (1 mmol) using tBuOK (3 mol
%) and the Mn complex 1 (1 mol %) in THF in a closed
system resulted in the formation of 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one in 75%
yield at 125 °C after 20 h (Table 1, entry 1). However, in the absence of base, only 8%
yield of the corresponding product was obtained (Table 1, entry 2). Changing the solvent
to 1,4-dioxane or toluene furnished the desired product in excellent
yields (96 and 98%, respectively; Table 1, entries 3 and 4). Exploring the effect
of bases, NaOEt, KH, NaOH, and Na2CO3 was employed
under similar reaction conditions giving decent yields of propiophenone
(NaOEt, 80%; KH, 97%, NaOH, 92%, Na2CO3, 52%)
(Table 1, entries 5–8).
Our previously reported dearomatized Mn-PNPtBu complex 2 and the deprotonated Mn-PNN complex 3 (Figure 1) were then screened,
affording 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one in 92 and 90% yields, respectively
(Table 1, entries 11
and 12). Decreasing the reaction time to 5 h resulted in only a slight
drop in conversion of the alcohol (92%) forming the corresponding
ketone product in 80% yield (Table 1, entry 10). Temperature does not play crucial role,
as lowering the temperature to 110 °C yielded 90% of the corresponding
product (Table 1, entry
9).

(2 mL), heated in a 25 mL Schlenk tube for given time at 125 °C.

b yields and conversions determined
by GC-MS analysis using m-xylene as internal standard.

Under the optimized reaction conditions
(toluene, 125 °C,
3 mol % tBuOK and 1 mol % 1), the scope of the manganese- catalyzed C-alkylation
of ketones was explored. As shown in Table 2, reactions of benzyl alcohols bearing electron-donating
substituents, including 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol,
3-N,N-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, 2-methoxybenzyl
alcohol, and 3,4-dimethoxy benzyl alcohol with acetophenone, produced
substituted 1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one derivatives in excellent yields
(Table 2, entries A–E).
Under similar conditions, benzyl alcohols bearing electron-withdrawing
substituents at the para positions, including 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol,
4-trifluoromethyl benzyl alcohol, and 4-bromobenzyl alcohol also afforded
selectively the corresponding C-alkylated products with good to moderate
yields (Table 2, entries
F–H). 4-Cyanobenzyl alcohol afforded 68% of corresponding product
in addition to a minute amount the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
product; no products of hydrogenation of the cyano group were observed
(Table 2, entry I).
Hex-5-en-1-ol as substrate afforded 61% of the target product without
any hydrogenation of the olefin functionality (Table 2 entry J). 2-Naphthalenemethanol was also
used as alkylating substrate with acetophenone, yielding the corresponding
product in 88% yield (entry K). The scope of the reaction was further
probed by employing the heterocyclic ketones 2-acetylpyridine and
2-acetylthiophene with benyzl alcohol, furnishing the corresponding
product in moderate 42% and 50% yields, respectively (entries L and
M). Aliphatic alcohols were also used under the optimized reaction
conditions. 2-Phenylethanol, 2-phenyl-1-propanol, 1-hexanol, and 3-methyl-1-pentanol
dehydrogenatively coupled with an equivalent amount of acetophenone,
affording the corresponding C-alkylated product in good to moderate
yields (entries N–P). C-Alkylation of the activated amide 2-oxindole
with benzyl alcohol yielded 78% of the deisred product (entry Q).
Employing the low-boiling methanol and ethanol resulted in poor yields
of the targeted α-alkylated product (see details in SI). The branched carbonyl substrate propiophenone
also afforded poor yield under the optimized condition, whereas cyclohexanone
was completely inactive toward alkylation with alcohols.

Table 2 C-Alkylation of Ketones with Alcohols
Catalyzed by 1a
a Conditions: ketone (1 mmol), alcohol
(1 mmol), 1 (0.01 mmol), tBuOK (3 equiv relative to 1), and 2 mL of toluene heated
in a 25 mL Schlenk tube at 125 °C in a closed system. Isolated
yield in parentheses.

b yields
are based on NMR or GC.

Interestingly, it is possible to employ a secondary alcohol instead
of a ketone. Thus, reaction of 1-phenyl ethanol (1 mmol) and benzyl
alcohol (1 mmol) in the presence of 1 mol % cat 1 and
3 mol % tBuOK at 125 °C resulted
in the corresponding ketone product in 86% yield (Scheme 3) with the liberation of water
and dihydrogen. Analysis of the gas phase by gas chromatography shows
the formation of H2 (see Figure S1 in SI). Reaction of 4-methyl-, 4-chloro-, and 3-N,N-dimethylamino-benzyl alcohols provide 66%, 72%,
and 70% of the corresponding α-alkylated ketones as the major
product with hydrogenated alcohol as the other product. 3-Pyridinemethanol
as substrate formed 78% of the corresponding ketone product under
the optimized conditions. β-Alkylation of secondary alcohols
to give α-alkylated ketones was previously reported using Ir,
Ru, and Cu complexes.27 Recently, β-alkylation
of secondary alcohols to give β-alkylated alcohols catalyzed
by Mn was reported.28

Scheme 3 Direct Synthesis
of Ketones by Dehydrogenative Coupling of Secondary
Alcohol with Primary Alcohol
Carboxylic acid derivatives, such as esters and amides,
are valuable
intermediates and products in industry and academia. A useful approach
to modify amides and esters is α-alkylation by alcohols. However,
alkylations of these compounds have proved to be challenging. Amides
have a relatively low CH-acidic nature due to resonance stabilization,
while esters are amenable to side reactions. Taking note of the good
performance of the Mn catalysts for C-alkylation of acetophenone,
we explored the possibility to use an ester as the coupling partner
(Table 3). The reaction
between benzyl alcohol and tert-butyl acetate was
investigated to find suitable reaction conditions. We found out that
in order to obtain optimum product yields, the amount of t-butyl acetate needed to be increased to 4 equiv at 125 °C using
1.5 equiv of tBuOK and complex 1 (5 mol %). The reactions were carried out in tBuOH as solvent in order to shift the equilibrium toward the
product. Thus, dehydrogenative coupling of benzyl- and 4-methylbenzyl
alcohol with t-butylacetate gave the corresponding
ester alkylation products in 65% and 68% yields, respectively (Table 3, entries1 and 2).
However, in the former case, formation of the α,β-unsaturated t-butylcinnamate was also observed. The use of the electron-deficient
4-chloro- and 4-trifluoromethyl benzyl alcohols furnished the corresponding
products in moderate yields with the formation of α,β-unsaturated
esters as major products (Table 3, entries 3 and 4). Moreover, we also explored the
possibility of C-alkylation of nonactivated amides with alcohols.

Table 3 C-Alkylation of Esters and Amides
Derivatives with Alcohols Catalyzed by 1a
a Conditions: for
esters: alcohol
(1 mmol), t-butyl acetate (4 mmol), 1 (0.05 mmol), tBuOK (1.5 equiv. relative
to alcohol), and tert-butanol (2 mL), heated in a
25 mL Schlenk tube. For amides: alcohol (1 mmol), N,N-dimethylacetamide (2 mmol), 1 (0.05
mmol), tBuOK (1.5 equiv relative to alcohol),
and toluene (2 mL), heated in a 25 mL Schlenk tube.

b conv. and yields determined by GC
and difference between conversion and yield indicate formation of
α,β-unsaturated products.

The reaction between benzyl alcohol and N,N-dimethylacetamide to give the C-alkylation of
amide product
was optimized in toluene at 125 °C using 1.5 equiv of tBuOK, 2 equiv of N,N-dimethylacetamide, benzyl alcohol derivatives (1 equiv), and complex 1 (5 mol %). Benzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, and 4-methoxybenzyl
alcohol afforded the corresponding C-alkylated products with very
good yields (86, 92, 96%, respectively) (entries 5–7). The
dehydrogenative coupling of the electron deficient 4-trifluoromethylbenzyl
alcohol with N,N dimethyacetamide
gave the desired product in 20% yield only (Table 3, entry 8). However, employing 4-acetylmorpholine
afforded 94% of the C-alkylated product upon treatment with benzyl
alcohol under the optimized condition. (Table 3, entry 9).

On the basis of our experimental
findings, and on recent mechanistic
investigations of Mn-catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of amines
and methanol,15a as well as on deoxygenation
of primary alcohols catalyzed by 1,15b we propose the plausible catalytic cycle depicted in Scheme 4. Dihydrogen liberation
from complex 1 leads to the amido complex A, which undergoes intramolecular C–H activation to form the
thermodynamically more stable C-metalated complex A′.15a O–H activation of the alcohol
by complex A or A′ via proton transfer,
to either the amido nitrogen or benzylic carbon, results in the formation
of the alkoxo complex B. The following β-hydride
elimination step29 releases the aldehyde.
Nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated methyl group of the carbonyl
functionality (ketone, ester, and amide) on the released aldehyde
followed by water elimination leads to the α,β-unsaturated
compound. The deprotonation of the methyl groups requires catalytic
(for ketones) or stoichiometric base (for amides and esters). It should
be mentioned at this stage that we previously reported that the same
catalyst 1 is active for the dehydrogenative coupling
of alcohols with nitriles in the absence of base to give substituted
acrylonitriles, in which the formed olefinic double bond is completely
inert toward hydrogenation by the evolved hydrogen.19 However, in the current case, the intermediate α,β-unsaturated
ketones (or esters, amides) undergo hydrogenation by the evolved hydrogen
generating the final C-alkylated product. The hydrogenation is most
likely mediated by some Mn species assisted by base, although it is
not clear how this hydrogenation occurs.

Scheme 4 Plausible Mechanism
for the α-Alkylation Reactions with Primary
Alcohols Catalyzed by Manganese
In conclusion, we have developed a manganese pincer catalyst
for
the efficient α-alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols,
generating water, via a hydrogen borrowing strategy. Formation of
α-alkylated ketones by dehydrogenative coupling of secondary
alcohols with primary alcohols was also achieved. Moreover, manganese-catalyzed
C-alkylations of nonactivated amides and esters was achieved for the
first time.
