Catalysis
of H2 production and oxidation reactions is
critical in renewable energy systems based around H2 as
a clean fuel, but the present reliance on platinum-based catalysts
is not sustainable. In nature, H2 is oxidized at minimal
overpotential and high turnover frequencies at [NiFe] catalytic sites
in hydrogenase enzymes. Although an outline mechanism has been established
for the [NiFe] hydrogenases involving heterolytic cleavage of H2 followed by a first and then second transfer of a proton
and electron away from the active site, details remain vague concerning
how the proton transfers are facilitated by the protein environment
close to the active site. Furthermore, although [NiFe] hydrogenases
from different organisms or cellular environments share a common active
site, they exhibit a broad range of catalytic characteristics indicating
the importance of subtle changes in the surrounding protein in controlling
their behavior. Here we review recent time-resolved infrared (IR)
spectroscopic studies and IR spectroelectrochemical studies carried
out in situ during electrocatalytic turnover. Additionally, we re-evaluate
the significant body of IR spectroscopic data on hydrogenase active
site states determined through more conventional solution studies,
in order to highlight mechanistic steps that seem to apply generally
across the [NiFe] hydrogenases, as well as steps which so far seem
limited to specific groups of these enzymes. This analysis is intended
to help focus attention on the key open questions where further work
is needed to assess important aspects of proton and electron transfer
in the mechanism of [NiFe] hydrogenases.

1 Introduction
Hydrogenases are ancient enzymes that evolved to allow primitive
organisms to extract energy from the H2-rich primordial
environment. The ability to oxidize or produce H2 is prevalent
in the microbial world and has emerged through three convergent pathways
that have yielded enzymes with [Fe], [FeFe], and [NiFe] catalytic
centers.1 The [NiFe] hydrogenases tend
to be more robust and have attracted significant interest from chemists
because their turnover frequencies, reaching >1000 s–1 for H2 oxidation, rival that of Pt active sites.1−3 Achieving a detailed structure–functional understanding of
these enzymes therefore offers promise for informing the design of
non-noble-metal H2-splitting catalysts.4 Here we address mechanistic questions relating to the catalytic
cycle of [NiFe] hydrogenases, focusing on insight obtained from recent
vibrational spectroscopic studies into proton- and electron-transfer
steps.

The [NiFe] family of hydrogenases share a core composition
of a
“large” subunit comprising the [NiFe] bimetallic active
site together with a smaller electron-transfer subunit containing
iron sulfur clusters which facilitate long-range transfer of electrons
released during H2 oxidation or required during H+ reduction.1 This pair of catalytic and
electron-transfer subunits recur in a modular fashion, coupled with
other functional subunits, in hydrogenases with diverse physiological
roles ranging from energy conservation to cellular redox balancing
and disposal of excess reducing equivalents.5,6 The
bimetallic [NiFe] catalytic site is coordinated to the protein via
two terminal cysteine ligands to Ni and two cysteines that bridge
the Ni and Fe, and the Fe is additionally coordinated by CO and two
CN– ligands which keep the Fe site low spin (Figure 1A). Amino acids surrounding,
but not directly coordinated to, the active site are also important
in proton-transfer steps in the mechanism of [NiFe] hydrogenases and
additional amino acids which are highly conserved across different
[NiFe] hydrogenases are shown in Figure 1B.

Figure 1 Highly conserved bimetallic active site of [NiFe]
hydrogenases.
Numbering refers to the amino acid sequence for E.
coli Hyd-1, and we use this numbering throughout.
Panel (A) shows two different orientations of the same structure to
highlight the coordination geometry around the metals. Panel (B) presents
the same structure, with the position of additional highly conserved
amino acid residues shown. The active site structure is representative,
but taken from crystallographic data for E. coli Hyd-1, PDB code 3USE, and prepared using Pymol.7

Mechanistic studies have focused on a small subset
of this broad
family of enzymes, and it has largely been assumed that a single mechanism
should apply to all [NiFe] hydrogenases. The fact that hydrogenases
operate on the smallest possible substrate molecule, H2, has so far prevented identification of a substrate-bound Michaelis–Menten
complex, although there have been suggestions from computational and
experimental studies regarding the nature of a transient H2 complex that precedes heterolytic cleavage of H2.8−10 The challenges are compounded by the difficulty in identifying the
location of H atoms crystallographically within a large protein molecule.11

The deceptively simple oxidation of H2 to release two
protons and two electrons necessarily involves coordinated proton
and electron-transfer processes, and our understanding of these steps
in [NiFe] hydrogenases remains limited so far. Electron transfer clearly
requires, as a first step, outer-sphere electron tunnelling from the
active site to the proximal iron sulfur cluster. Several long-range
proton-transfer pathways involving both amino acids and ordered water
molecules have been discussed.12−18,11 There are several well-conserved
amino acid residues close to the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases,
and therefore, multiple possibilities exist for the initial steps
in proton transfer during catalysis, as we discuss below.

Vibrational
spectroscopy, and in particular infrared (IR) spectroscopy,
has played an important role in characterizing the active site states
of hydrogenases, and indeed provided the first identification of the
diatomic ligands detected in an early crystal structure of a [NiFe]
hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas as the biologically unusual CO and CN– groups.19−22 Subsequently, a number of [NiFe] hydrogenases have been characterized
through solution IR studies that focus on shifts in the vibrational
bands arising from the active site CO and CN– ligands
according to changes in electron density at the active site.1,23 The position of the CO stretching band, νCO, is
particularly diagnostic because an increase in electron density at
the active site increases back-donation to π* orbitals of the
ligand, weakening the CO bond and shifting the νCO band to lower wavenumber (relative energy). Solution IR spectroelectrochemical
studies were thus of particular importance in developing an understanding
of the different redox states of [NiFe] hydrogenases.1,23,24 These are typically carried out
in a transmission cell incorporating a gold mini-grid working electrode
for electron transfer to hydrogenase solutions, mediated via a system
of soluble small-molecule redox molecules.1,23,25Table 1 lists νCO positions for the main
states observed for [NiFe] hydrogenases that have been characterized
most thoroughly by IR spectroscopy, and we return to a more detailed
analysis of this data below.

a The precise νCO peak
positions are dependent upon the measurement conditions so
there are small variations throughout the literature.

b The Ni-A state is an inactive state
at the Ni-B redox level that is slow to undergo reductive activation;
the Ni-SU and Ni-SIr states are additional states at the
Nia-SI redox level that are not thought to be involved
in catalysis but are intermediates in activation of the oxidized Ni-A
and Ni-B states, respectively.1

c The Ni-SU state of D.
vulgaris Miyazaki F was initially assigned as
1946 cm–126 and is generally
cited with this value,1,3 although it has also been assigned
as 1958 cm–1.28,46

d We have reassigned this state as
a Nia-R state based upon its appearance upon extended reductive
treatment.

e In a later report
on R. eutropha MBH,47 a single
Nia-L state with νCO at ∼1910 cm–1 was observed upon illumination at cryogenic temperature;
the origin of this discrepancy is unclear.

f We have reassigned our previously
reported Nia-L states of E. coli Hyd-1 in order of decreasing νCO band position,
all other Nia-L states are reported as in the primary literature.

The ease of following the relatively
intense CO and CN stretching
vibrational bands means that IR studies on hydrogenases have focused
almost entirely on the active site. They have been complemented by
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies on frozen
hydrogenase samples which reveal not only the paramagnetic NiIII and NiI active site states but also the redox
properties of the iron sulfur relay clusters.24,43,48−52 The outline mechanism for H2 oxidation
(or the reverse sequence for proton reduction) shown in Scheme 1 has emerged from combined
analysis of these studies together with DFT studies that target the
active site region.

Scheme 1 Skeletal Mechanism for H2 Oxidation and
Production at
the Active Site of [NiFe] Hydrogenases
The colors used here for specific
states of the active site are utilized throughout this Perspective.
Catalytically active states are labeled “Nia-X”,
where X = SI, C, R, or L. The oxidized, inactive, Ni-B state is included
in the scheme as it is observed in spectroscopic data presented elsewhere
in this Perspective.

[NiFe] hydrogenases tend
to be isolated in a mixture of oxidized,
inactive states at the NiIII FeII level, as
well as states at the NiII FeII level.3 The Ni-B (blue) and Nia-SI (green)
states shown in Scheme 1 are important states at these redox levels, although other oxidized
forms are observed in some hydrogenases.1,44 Nia-SI is directly relevant to catalysis and is the state that undergoes
initial interaction with H2 (hence the subscript “a”
for “active”); however, Ni-B requires reductive activation
by electrons or H2 and is reformed reversibly when the
enzyme becomes oxidized. Heterolytic cleavage of H2 yields
the diamagnetic NiII FeII state, Nia-R (red), with a bridging hydride between the metals and a proton
residing on, or close to, the active site. Transfer of the proton
and an electron away from the active site gives Nia-C (purple).
Further transfer of a second proton and electron away from the active
site recovers Nia-SI, either directly or via a NiI intermediate. This NiI intermediate is termed Nia-L because in earlier studies it was observed during illumination
of Nia-C (hence L, for light), usually only at low temperatures.24 Nia-C and Nia-L are at
the same redox level and are simply tautomers in which electrons from
the hydride in Nia-C are transferred to the Ni to give
the formally NiI species in Nia-L with the proton
residing on a nearby basic residue. Simulation of IR and advanced
EPR data has indicated the presence of a metal–metal bond in
Nia-L,53 accounting for high
electron density on Fe in this state as evidenced by low νCO band positions (Table 1). There is no particular reason why the acceptor site
for the first proton (in Nia-R) and the second proton (in
Nia-L) need be the same.54 In Scheme 1, the proton acceptor
sites are not specified, nor is the redox state of the iron–sulfur
electron acceptor cluster proximal to the active site, and these points
are discussed in more detail below.

Questions of the proton-transfer
pathways in hydrogenases are highly
relevant to the development of functional biomimetic catalysts. For
example, Dubois and co-workers have demonstrated significant improvements
in the activity of nickel complexes for H2 oxidation or
proton reduction when an amine-based proton relay system is included.55 Developments in the second coordination sphere
of biomimetic systems have been described recently.56

Much of the spectroscopic work on hydrogenases has
focused on identification
of the different redox and coordination states exhibited by the active
site of [NiFe] hydrogenases, but more recently, the focus has shifted
to examining transitions between states and the relevance of these
transitions to catalytic turnover. The approach known as protein film
electrochemistry permits efficient catalytic turnover to be controlled
as a function of electrode potential in a range of solution conditions,57−59 and although this technique itself does not provide structural information,
it is useful when combined with IR spectroscopy to allow spectra to
be collected during steady state turnover of hydrogenase (an approach
we have termed protein film infrared electrochemistry, PFIRE).35 More transient states have also been probed
in time-resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques in which transitions
between states of a hydrogenase have been triggered by the release
of caged electrons or by photolysis of light-sensitive states of the
enzyme.41,42,60 Attention
has also focused on the role of conserved amino acids in the region
around the active site in controlling proton transfer,12,54,61−63 and the correlation
between the redox state of the proximal cluster and that of the active
site.36,60 These studies have been aided by the availability
of site-directed variants of [NiFe] hydrogenases with particular amino
acid exchanges in the region of the active site and the proximal iron
sulfur cluster.12,54,61,63 However, one limitation to recent studies
of [NiFe] hydrogenases has been that each vibrational spectroscopy
approach has only been applied to one or two different hydrogenases,
and it remains to be seen whether the findings from each approach
represent aspects of a common [NiFe] hydrogenase mechanism or whether
certain details are specific to individual hydrogenases.

Classification
of [NiFe] Hydrogenases
Although this
Perspective focuses on mechanistic aspects of H2 oxidation
in [NiFe] hydrogenases, some discussion of the biological classification
of [NiFe] hydrogenases is necessary in order to appreciate the structural
and functional variations between different enzymes of this type,
and in turn the possible influence of the protein environment on mechanistic
steps in H2 oxidation at the active site. Classification
of hydrogenases is mainly based on phylogenetic analysis of their
amino acid sequences and is surveyed briefly here, but has been discussed
in detail and tabulated elsewhere.5,6

Many
of the well-studied [NiFe] hydrogenases belong to the group of membrane-bound
H2-uptake hydrogenases known as Group 1. X-ray crystallographic
structures are available for a number of members of this Group,11,63−71 and several have been characterized extensively using vibrational
spectroscopic methods (Table 1, and discussed in more detail below). The Group I hydrogenases
incorporate a large subunit, housing the [NiFe] active site, a small
subunit comprising a chain of three electron-relay iron sulfur clusters,
and may also comprise one or more membrane anchor subunits. Some of
these enzymes are likely to exist as multimers of the large and small
subunit pair. The typical large/small subunit arrangement is shown
in Figure 2A, represented
by Escherichia coli hydrogenase 1 (Hyd-1).
Subclassifications within Group 1 distinguish the well-studied “ancestral”
or “prototypical” [NiFe] hydrogenases, which are typically
sensitive to O2, from the “O2-tolerant”
[NiFe] hydrogenases. The former link H2 oxidation to a
range of inorganic electron acceptors such as sulfate or nitrate,
whereas “O2-tolerant” [NiFe] hydrogenases
are often involved in aerobic respiration. Certain structural characteristics
appear to be associated with O2-tolerant hydrogenases.
Crystallographically characterized enzymes of this type, including
the membrane bound hydrogenase (MBH) from Ralstonia
eutropha,65,72 Hyd-1 from E. coli,69,73 and MBH from Hydrogenovibrio marinus(64) which have an unusual high potential [4Fe-3S] electron relay iron
sulfur cluster in their small subunit in the position proximal to
the active site, coordinated by 6 Cys residues (Figure 2B).74 The MBH
from Aquifex aeolicus also has a high
potential proximal cluster capable of transferring two electrons to/from
the active site.49 This contrasts with
the standard [4Fe-4S] proximal cluster coordinated by 4 Cys residues
(Figure 2C) that is
typical of the O2-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenases. The biological
function of other subgroups within Group 1 is less well-established.
It has been suggested that the so-called “actinobacterial type”
[NiFe] hydrogenases, some of which can scavenge H2 at levels
found in the lower atmosphere, may be appropriately included in Group
1 rather than segregated in Group 5.6 These
enzymes comprise a 3Cys1Asp coordinated proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster
(Figure 2D).75

cluster with Asp-3Cys coordination in the actinobacterial-type hydrogenase
from Ralstonia eutropha (PDB code 5AA5). Prepared using
Pymol.7

A related set of [NiFeSe] hydrogenases exist, in which a
terminal
cysteine residue coordinated to Ni at the active site is replaced
by selenocysteine. The active site chemistry of the [NiFeSe] hydrogenases
is less well understood. The selenium atom of the selenocysteine residue
is more polarizable and has a lower pKa than the cysteine equivalent, and these enzymes are found to be
extremely active.1,76,77 Although these hydrogenases do not exhibit EPR-active oxidized states
(at the Ni-B redox level, Scheme 1), H2 oxidation activity is inhibited by
O2,76 and the enzymes undergo
oxidative anaerobic inactivation78 in protein
film electrochemistry measurements. There is IR spectroscopic evidence
for the Nia-C and Nia-R states of the active
site,79,80 and Nia-L states have been observed
by EPR spectroscopy upon illumination at cryogenic temperatures.80,81

Hydrogenases of Groups 2–4 have been studied less extensively.
The Group 2 [NiFe] hydrogenases are cytosolic and include the sensing
hydrogenases, of which the regulatory hydrogenase (RH) from R. eutropha has been most studied.3,40,52,82−87R. eutropha RH has been shown to
have a particularly low potential proximal cluster, below ca. −0.5
V,52 and this may be significant in its
behavior as this means the proximal cluster potential lies more negative
than the potential of the H+/H2 couple potential
at neutral pH. The Group 3 enzymes are also cytosolic and comprise
a dimeric [NiFe] hydrogenase unit coupled via an extended iron sulfur
electron-transfer chain to an enzyme moiety equipped for reducing
biological cofactors. These include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, NADP+, or “cofactor 420”, also known as F420 (8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin).6 The Group
3 enzymes are known as “bidirectional” because they
function reversibly in vivo (although note that most [NiFe] hydrogenases
function reversibly in vitro, oxidizing H2, and reducing
H+ in the presence of appropriate acceptors or donors).
Only one crystal structure exists for Group 3, that of the F420-reducing hydrogenase from Methanothermobacter marburgensis,18Figure 3, although it is far from representative of the Group
as a whole because there is considerable variation in the number and
type of subunits and the redox cofactors present in different enzymes
of this Group. The Group 3 hydrogenases also vary in their tolerance
to O2.3,5,6,43,44 Limited spectroscopic
data exist for the Group 3 hydrogenases, but those for which some
data exist include NAD+-reducing soluble hydrogenases HoxHYFUI2 from R. eutropha,43,44,51 the HoxHY module of HoxEFUYH
from the photosynthetic bacterium Allochromatium vinosum,88 and the bidirectional [NiFe] hydrogenase
from Synechocystis.45 The
NADP+-reducing soluble hydrogenase (SH) 1 from Pyrococcus furiosus, a hyperthermophilic archaeon,
has been studied more extensively using time-resolved IR methods.41,42,61

3 enzymes.

of [NiFe] hydrogenases from Groups 1,
2, and 3.

2 Experimental Evidence for
States Involved in
the [NiFe] Hydrogenase Catalytic Cycle
In this section, we
introduce evidence for each step in the [NiFe]
hydrogenase catalytic cycle (as outlined in Scheme 1) viewed in the direction of H2 oxidation, and we discuss recent developments in the context of
recent vibrational spectroscopic data and reanalysis of earlier data.  

There is relatively little evidence
for the structure of the EPR-silent
NiIIFeII Nia-SI state,89 and it is generally depicted with a vacant coordination
site at the bridging position between Ni and Fe. The Nia-SI state is in acid–base equilibrium with an inactive state
known as Ni-SIr, which is deprotonated relative to Nia-SI.1,26 The pKa value of this equilibrium is 7.8 ± 0.1 in the [NiFe] hydrogenase
from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki
F (MF).26 Computational studies have suggested
that one of the terminal cysteine ligands to the active site may be
protonated in Nia-SI,90,91 although models
in which these ligands are deprotonated have also been considered.92 The Nia-SI state reacts with H2, which is cleaved heterolytically and reduces the active
site to the Nia-R state (also EPR silent),93 leaving a bridging hydride ligand at the active site. The
initial acceptor for the proton released upon H2 cleavage
is still a matter of debate, as is the precise location of H2 binding and the nature of a (probably transient) Michaelis–Menten
complex between Nia-SI and H2.

The most
common representation of the Nia-R state is
that shown in Figure 4A, in which a terminal cysteine (C) thiolate coordinated to NiII acted as the initial proton acceptor (C546 in D. vulgaris MF notation, C576 in E.
coli Hyd 1 notation). Experimental evidence for this
representation of Nia-R and the presence of a bridging
hydride ligand was first provided by a 0.89 Å resolution crystal
structure of the [NiFe] hydrogenase from D. vulgaris MF (electron density map shown in Figure 4B),11 where a
shortened Ni–H distance relative to Fe–H showed tighter
binding of the hydride to Ni at the active site. The presence of a
bridging hydride was confirmed by nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy
(NRVS)94,95 where a vibration at 675 cm–1 was shown to be sensitive to H/D isotope exchange and assigned to
a Ni–H–Fe wag vibrational mode by comparison with DFT
calculations and spectra of model compounds (Figure 4C). Protonation of a terminal thiolate is
supported by earlier DFT calculations on the EPR silent states of
the active site; thiolate protonation was required to model the Nia-SI state, and both thiolate protonation and a bridging hydride
ligand were necessary to accurately reproduce the IR peak positions
of the Nia-RI state of D. vulgaris MF [NiFe] hydrogenase.91 In agreement
with the crystallographic data of Ogata et al.,11 calculations have shown that protonation of the terminal
cysteine thiolate, C576 (E. coli notation),
gives a state that is 14–51 kJ mol–1 lower
in energy than protonation at any other active site coordinated cysteine.96 A key feature of the Nia-R crystal
structure is asymmetric binding of the bridging hydride, which is
more closely associated with Ni. A common feature of bimetallic hydride-containing
mimetic compounds is Fe-centered reactivity (for a comprehensive review,
see Schilter et al.),4 but a recent structural
and electronic analogue of the Nia-R state has been reported which
contains a Ni-bound hydride.97

On the basis of the representation of the Nia-R
state
shown in Figure 4A,
the mechanism of the transition between Nia-SI and Nia-R is generally suggested to involve initial side-on binding
of H2 to Ni in a Kubas-complex type arrangement,98,99 with a cysteine thiolate sulfur acting as a base and accepting the
initial proton during H2 splitting (Figure 5A). Reversible protonation of a Ni-coordinated
terminal thiolate has been demonstrated in a bimetallic mimetic compound
(Figure 5B) that is
also an active proton reduction catalyst.100 Treatment of a dichloromethane solution of [1] with HBF4 results in quantitative formation of the salt [1H][BF4], which can then be deprotonated by addition of water. However,
biomimetic catalysts are generally poor at H2 oxidation
and require strong acids or bases to produce or oxidize H2, respectively.100−102

protonation of a Ni-coordinated terminal thiolate ligand has been

An alternative mechanism for the
Nia-SI to Nia-R transition was proposed by Armstrong
and co-workers, who demonstrated
that a strictly conserved arginine residue (R509 in E. coli Hyd-1 notation) was important for H2 oxidation activity in E. coli Hyd-1.54 The guanidinium side chain of this arginine
residue suspends a nitrogen atom 4.5 Å above the bridging coordination
position of the Ni-Fe active site in the wild type enzyme (Figure 6A). Substitution
of the arginine residue for lysine generated a variant, R509K, with
100-fold lower H2 oxidation activity than wild type Hyd-1
(Figure 6B) despite
the structure of the inner coordination sphere of the active site
being virtually unchanged (Figure 6C). This led to the suggestion of a frustrated Lewis
pair (FLP)-type mechanism for H2 splitting in which the
guanidinium side chain is transiently deprotonated and the resulting
guanidine provides the strong base required for H2 cleavage
(Figure 7A). This mechanism
has obvious similarities to FeFe hydrogenases, in which an azadithiolate
bridging ligand positions a basic nitrogen atom above the distal Fe
site of the active site H-cluster (Figure 7B),103 and also
to enzyme-inspired mimetic Ni pincer complexes, which contain pendant
amine groups acting as the initial proton acceptor during H2 oxidation (Figure 7C).104,56

of a conserved

The representations of
the Nia-R state suggested by
these mechanisms for H2 activation are oversimplified.
IR studies on a range of [NiFe] hydrogenases show that there are (at
least) three different (sub)states at the Nia-R redox level
(labeled Nia-RI, Nia-RII, and Nia-RIII according to literature convention,
see Table 1 and references
therein). In the case of E. coli Hyd-1,
two Nia-R states are observed in the reduced enzyme and
are nearly equally populated.35 IR spectra
of the crystal samples used to determine the structure of the Nia-R state of D. vulgaris MF
[NiFe] hydrogenase were predominantly in the state Nia-RI (see Table 1), but the crystals also contained up to 18% of a second Nia-R state, Nia-RII.11 Since all of the Nia-R states in these studies were generated
by reaction with H2, it seems reasonable to assume that
they are all equally likely to be functionally relevant, and therefore,
inclusion of a single picture of the Nia-R state in the
catalytic cycle may be an oversimplification (although the presence
of “unproductive” Nia-R states, not along
the reaction coordinate but in rapid equilibrium remains a possibility,
see Discussion below).  

The
Nia-R and Nia-C states have long
been
assumed to be catalytic intermediates general to all [NiFe] hydrogenases.
The catalytic relevance of these states is supported by recent vibrational
spectroscopic studies.35,41 Vincent and co-workers used protein
film IR electrochemistry (PFIRE, an in situ application of IR spectroscopy
to protein film electrochemistry) to demonstrate the presence of Nia-SI, Nia-R, and Nia-C during electrocatalytic
turnover.35Figure 8A,B show IR spectra collected from the same
sample of E. coli Hyd-1 under both
nonturnover (Ar, Figure 8A) and steady-state turnover (H2, Figure 8B) conditions. In the absence of H2, a significant population of both Nia-SI and the oxidized,
inactive Ni-B state (blue) are present at −0.074 V versus the
standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), whereas only the Ni-B state is
observed at +0.356 V. In the presence of H2 the distribution
of active site states reflects the steady-state populations of catalytically
active intermediates. Two Nia-R states (red) are observed
as the majority species at −0.074 V, and the population of
the Nia-SI state (green) has diminished suggesting rapid
reaction with H2. The most striking differences occur at
+0.356 V, however, as the Nia-SI, Nia-R, Nia-C and Nia-L (orange) states are all present under
H2 when they are completely absent at this potential under
nonturnover conditions in an Ar atmosphere. The accompanying current–time
traces are shown in Figure 8C. The stable, constant current observed at −0.074
V indicates efficient mass transport to the electrode-immobilized
hydrogenase, whereas the monotonic decay in current at +0.356 V is
due to the well-established slow oxidative inactivation which leads
to conversion of a proportion of the enzyme to the Ni-B state. The
presence of a species during steady-state turnover is not enough on
its own to confirm involvement in catalysis, however. Dyer and co-workers
used time-resolved IR spectroscopy to provide the first direct evidence
that the Nia-SI, Nia-C, and Nia-R
states can interconvert on time scales faster than the turnover frequency
of the hydrogenase being studied (P. furiosus SH1 has a modest turnover frequency of 62 s–1 for
H+ reduction under the experimental conditions in Figure 8D,41 although higher turnover frequencies are observed at elevated
temperatures105,106) and thus are sufficiently kinetically
competent to be catalytic intermediates.41 A rapid photoinduced reductive potential jump of ca. 50 mV was applied
to P. furiosus SH1, using the cofactor
NADH as a “caged electron” source. Figure 8D shows the absorption transients
from one such experiment, demonstrating the conversion of Nia-C (purple) to Nia-R (red) from roughly 0.5 ms onward.
An additional intermediate between Nia-R and Nia-C may be implied by the slight delay in Nia-R formation
relative to Nia-C decay and is accounted for in the kinetic
scheme used to model the transient absorption spectra (inset, Figure 8D).

In terms of the outline catalytic
states shown in Scheme 1, the regulatory hydrogenase
from R. eutropha was, initially, a
puzzling case. Despite the fact that solution assays on this enzyme
demonstrated catalytic H2 oxidation (albeit with a very
low turnover frequency), the Nia-R state(s) were not observed
upon treatment with H2,82,83,87 or electrochemical reduction in solution.86 This lead to suggestion of a distinct two-state
catalytic cycle for this enzyme involving only Nia-SI and
Nia-C.1,3 Recently, however, PFIRE spectra
have revealed the presence of at least one Nia-R state
during catalytic H2 oxidation,40 suggesting that a common set of redox levels is conserved across
the [NiFe] hydrogenases from quite different Groups.  

For a long time , the catalytic cycle
of [NiFe] hydrogenases were
thought to contain only three states, Nia-SI, Nia-C, and Nia-R, at least from an experimentalist’s
perspective, as these were the only states that had been observed
under “normal”, “physiologically relevant”
conditions.1 Additional state(s) had been
observed at the Nia-C redox level, the Nia-L
states, but were thought to be an artifact due to the unusual conditions
of illumination at cryogenic temperature seemingly required for their
formation.24 The tacit assumption behind
these assertions was that the second proton-coupled electron-transfer
step in the H2 oxidation mechanism, the transition from
Nia-C to Nia-SI, must be concerted and that
no other intermediates were involved (Scheme 1). From a theoretical viewpoint, however,
additional intermediates during the transition from Nia-C to Nia-SI have been considered for quite some time.
Nia-L, or a structurally similar NiI state formed
upon deprotonation of a NiIII species containing a bridging
hydride, has been implicated in computational studies of the catalytic
cycle by the groups of Siegbahn, Hall, and Ryde8,107,96 and was suggested as an intermediate by
Lindahl108 while discussing the role of
metal–metal bonds in [NiFe] hydrogenases. Sequential proton-
and electron-transfer steps have been established for small-molecule
Ni-based H2 production catalysts.55 Recently Brazzolotto et al. reported a bimetallic [NiFe] biomimetic
compound that produces H2 at a rate of 250 s–1 via a catalytic pathway that contains structural analogues of both
Nia-L and Nia-R states.97

Experimentally, growing evidence supports the involvement
of Nia-L as an intermediate. Hirota and co-workers demonstrated
that it is possible to produce significant quantities of Nia-SI during photolysis of the Nia-C state at low temperature,
but only from samples in which the proximal iron–sulfur cluster
is oxidized and therefore can accept electrons from the active site
(Figure 9A).60Figure 9B shows prephotolysis spectra and light-minus-dark difference spectra following photolysis for samples of the
O2-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenase from D.
vulgaris MF under a H2 atmosphere. Positive
bands relate to species that are accumulated as a result of photolysis,
at the expense of species with negative bands. At all temperatures
studied, the “normal” photoconversion of Nia-C to Nia-L is observed, with the stability (lifetime)
of the photoproduct increasing at lower temperatures. In contrast, Figure 9C shows a similar
set of pre- and postphotolysis spectra, this time under a N2 atmosphere. Again, photoconversion of Nia-C to Nia-L is observed, but now a significant photoinduced increase
in the population of Nia-SI is observed. The difference
between these two sets of photolysis spectra lies in the redox state
of the proximal cluster. Under a N2 atmosphere, the proximal
cluster is oxidized in a significant proportion of the D. vulgaris MF hydrogenase sample in the Nia-C state, as determined by EPR spectroscopy,60 and can therefore accept an electron from the photogenerated NiI active site. Under a H2 atmosphere, the proximal
cluster is reduced and unable to accept an electron from Nia-L. These results suggest a pathway exists between Nia-L and Nia-SI, gated by the oxidation state of the proximal
cluster (Figure 9A).

A related effect has been observed
by Murphy et al.,36 who demonstrated a
pH-dependent equilibrium
between the Nia-C and Nia-L states of E. coli Hyd-1. The reversible conversion of Nia-C to Nia-L in E. coli Hyd-1 proceeds readily in the dark at ambient temperature, and the
Nia-C and Nia-L species share the same potential
dependence over the pH range studied. The proximal clusters of Group
1 O2-tolerant hydrogenases have unusually high reduction
potentials, more positive than the Nia-L/Nia-SI potential at all pH values. The proximal cluster will therefore
predominantly be in the reduced state, consistent with the ease of
observation of Nia-L in these hydrogenases (see Figure 9A). Vincent and co-workers
have demonstrated that Nia-L is formed reversibly in response
to steady-state H2 oxidation by E. coli Hyd-1 (Figure 8B).35 A low level of Nia-SI production
from Nia-C is also evident in earlier low-temperature photoinduced
IR spectra of R. eutropha MBH.47

Transient, reversible formation of Nia-SI from Nia-L on subturnover frequency time scales
has been demonstrated
during light-triggered measurements at room temperature by Dyer109 and co-workers.41,42 Essentially
instantaneous formation of two Nia-L states was observed
upon photolysis, within 100 ns of illumination (i.e., faster than
the experimental time resolution), and the relaxation of both these
states followed approximately equal decay kinetics. Kinetic modeling
of transient absorption spectra of the Nia-C, Nia-SI, and both Nia-L states (similar to those shown in Figure 8D) revealed that
the Nia-L species are sequential, on-pathway intermediates
during the transition between Nia-C and Nia-SI.
The relative intensities of the two Nia-L states were found
to be pH dependent below pH 7.5, with only one Nia-L species
observed at pH 6.1. Dyer and co-workers interpreted this observation
as evidence that a proton acceptor site becomes unavailable as the
pH is lowered, blocking proton transfer away from the active site.42 Hirota and co-workers observed pH-dependence
of Nia-L formation from Nia-C, with two Nia-L states, differing in νCO by 20 cm–1, observed at high pH.110

3 Discussion
Implications of Multiple Nia-L
States on the [NiFe]
Hydrogenase Mechanism
Significant variation is found in the
absolute νCO band positions of all states of the
[NiFe] active site between different hydrogenases (Table 1). However, in all [NiFe] hydrogenases
studied to date, the Nia-C state has the highest νCO band of the catalytically active states. For any given hydrogenase,
there is good agreement between the νCO band positions
of all the active states relative to νCO of Nia-C, and so Nia-C can be used as an internal standard
(see Supporting Information Figure S1).
This concept is demonstrated particularly well for the Nia-SI state in Figure 10A, which plots the relative νCO band positions of
the Nia-SI and Nia-L states for the hydrogenases
listed in Table 1.
The νCO band of the Nia-SI state is on
average 19.7 cm–1 lower than that of Nia-C, and all the relative positions lie within 1.5 standard deviations
of this value (the shaded regions in Figure 10 represent ±2 standard deviations of
the mean). Treating the Nia-L states in the same way results
in three groupings of relative νCO energies (not
all Nia-L states have been observed by IR spectroscopy
in all the hydrogenases listed in Table 1 so the precise assignment to “I”,
“II”, or “III” is less well-defined than
for the Nia-R states, which are simply labeled in order
of decreasing νCO band position). The relative Nia-L positions highlight differences between different types
of hydrogenases. Group 1 O2-sensitive hydrogenases tend
to have a single higher wavenumber Nia-L as the dominant
species (the lower νCO species in D. vulgaris MF [NiFe] hydrogenase is only evident
as a minor component in photolysis spectra recorded at high pH),110 whereas the Group 1 O2-tolerant E. coli Hyd-1 and A. aeolicus Hase 1 display additional Nia-L species with νCO positions that are ≥20 cm–1 lower.
In addition, the Nia-L state(s) of O2-sensitive
Group 1 hydrogenases have only been observed during photolysis at
low temperatures, whereas for O2-tolerant hydrogenases
Nia-L is observed under a variety of more ambient conditions.
These observations possibly reflect a more weakly bound hydride in
the Nia-C state of O2-tolerant Group 1 hydrogenases,
as demonstrated for A. aeolicus Hase
1.38

Figure 10 Relative νCO positions
of catalytically active
states of [NiFe] hydrogenases show remarkably similar wavenumber positions
with respect to the Nia-C state. (A) Relative positions
of the Nia-SI and Nia-L states, showing that
the Nia-L states fall into three groupings of νCO. (B) Relative positions of the Nia-R states demonstrates
three νCO groupings. Calculated using the data in Table 1. Shaded regions represent
±2 standard deviations of the mean relative νCO position for each state (νCO values for R. eutropha SH have been omitted from these calculations
as they are less well-characterized but are plotted for comparison;
open squares/triangles). Included for comparison are results from
DFT calculations of the Nia-SI,91 Nia-L,53 and Nia-R91 states (open diamonds).

Limited data are available for Group 3 hydrogenases.
In the only
reports to date on Nia-L for these hydrogenases, for P. furiosus SH1,41,42 only higher
wavenumber Nia-L states have been reported. The Nia-L states of P. furiosus SH1
are a noteworthy case as transient IR spectra reveal that at least
two Nia-L states are catalytically relevant, despite the
fact that a stable Nia-L population is not normally observed
under dark conditions (although a small population of Nia-L is observed under laboratory illumination at pH ≥ 8.5).41,42 Observation of a stable Nia-L state under “physiologically
relevant” conditions is therefore not a prerequisite for involvement
of Nia-L in the catalytic cycle. This could have implications
for the catalytic relevance of Nia-L in O2-sensitive
Group 1 hydrogenases, and the Group 2 RH from R. eutropha, where Nia-L species have so far only been observed following
photolysis of Nia-C.1,40,82

The pH dependence of Nia-L formation36,110 confirms earlier suggestions that the difference between Nia-L states is the location of the proton released from the
hydride bridge in Nia-C. The change in νCO upon Nia-L formation depends upon how far removed the
proton becomes from the active site, with higher wavenumber states
likely to contain a proton more closely associated with the active
site. Deprotonation of the active site (complete removal of the proton
from the primary coordination sphere) would increase electron density
at the active site and lead to a substantially lower νCO.91,100,53 Theoretical
calculations of the Nia-L state, included for comparison
as orange open diamonds in Figure 8A, indicate a lowering of the νCO band
position by ∼30 cm–1 between models with
a protonated terminal cysteine thiolate and a completely deprotonated
active site.53 Although neither of these
models precisely reproduce the experimental Nia-L νCO positions relative to the calculated νCO band of Nia-C, the difference between the protonated
cysteine thiolate and deprotonated active site models is very similar
to the difference in νCO between the highest and
lowest wavenumber Nia-L groups. A similar change in νCO (−45–50 cm–1) following
protonation of a terminal thiolate ligand has been observed in the
biomimetic cluster shown in Figure 5.100 These observations
suggest that the three groupings of Nia-L states in Figure 10A (in order of
decreasing νCO position) could correspond to protonation
of the primary coordination sphere of the active site, protonation
of an acceptor within hydrogen-bonding distance of the active site
and complete deprotonation of the active site. Dyer and co-workers
have demonstrated that changes in νCO position as
a result of either a change in redox state of the proximal iron sulfur
cluster or protonation changes at nearby amino acid residues are much
smaller (< ∼5 cm–1).42 The catalytic relevance of the Nia-L substates
is not yet clear, and it is possible that one or more of these substates
correspond to off-pathway species.

The location of possible
protonation sites is still under investigation,
although a number of proton-transfer pathways have been postulated
on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis, theoretical modeling, and
crystallographic data. Raman spectroscopic evidence on R. eutropha MBH47 and
theoretical studies53,96 suggest that a terminal cysteine
thiolate is the initial proton acceptor in the Nia-C to
Nia-L transition: a recent computational study by Ryde
has shown that, of the four cysteine thiolates coordinated to the
active site, protonation of C576 (in Hyd-1 notation) leads to the
lowest energy structure.96 A conserved
glutamate residue (E28 in Hyd-1 notation) located close to the Ni-bound
terminal cysteine thiolates is suggested to be important for proton
transfer beyond the primary coordination sphere of the active site
on the basis of mutagenesis studies,12 and
is the active-site terminus of a number of putative proton-transfer
pathways.11−14,30 Time-resolved photolysis measurements
by Dyer and co-workers have established this residue as a proton acceptor
site during the Nia-L to Nia-SI transition in P. furiosus SH1,61 consistent
with their earlier study which showed that proton transfer is mediated
by an amino acid residue with pKa ∼
7.42

Taken together, these results
support mechanism(s) in which some
or all of the Nia-L states represent sequential proton
movement away from the active site ahead of electron transfer to the
proximal cluster during the transition from Nia-C to Nia-SI. This is shown in Scheme 2, which considers possible proton-transfer events in
the vicinity of the [NiFe] active site. Proton migration to a terminal
cysteine thiolate results in two distinct Nia-L states
(Scheme 2a,b) that
are in rapid equilibrium and differ in the degree of hydrogen bonding
to the carboxylate group of E28; these are the proposed structures
of the two Nia-L species observed in P.
furiosus SH1, with closely spaced νCO (Figure 10A).42,61 The transition to Nia-SI can then proceed either through
concerted elementary proton and electron transfer (Scheme 2b to Nia-SI) or
through sequential chemical (C) and electrochemical/electron-transfer
(E) steps (in electrochemistry notation)111 via one (or more) Nia-L states with a deprotonated primary
coordination sphere (Scheme 2c,d) in a C(C)E mechanism.

Scheme 2 Possible Sequential Involvement of
Nia-L States in the
Transition between Nia-C and Nia-SI
With reference to the groupings
of Nia-L states shown in Figure 10A: (a) and (b) are proposed structures of
the high wavenumber Nia-L species, such as those observed
in P. furiosus SH1, in which a proton
is retained in the primary coordination sphere of the [NiFe] active
site; (c) and (d) are possible structures of the two lower wavenumber
Nia-L species, with a deprotonated primary coordination
sphere.

Because of the large H/D kinetic isotope
effect (>40)41 and pH dependence of
the Nia-L to
Nia-S transition,42 Dyer and
co-workers favor concerted transfer of an electron and a proton (Scheme 2b to Nia-SI). They calculate a ΔG value of −1 kJ/mol for the concerted process on the
basis of the relative concentrations of Nia-L and Nia-SI during a defined time window following photolysis of Nia-C, and they make the assumption that ΔG > 0 for oxidation of (b) without coupled deprotonation.61 While entirely consistent with available data
for P. furiosus SH1, this model is
not necessarily consistent with the work of Hirota and co-workers
on D. vulgaris MF hydrogenase,110 who showed that the relative populations of
protonated (b) and deprotonated (c or d) Nia-L states are
pH-dependent with a calculated ΔG value of
−1.2 ± 0.9 kJ/mol for their interconversion. Neither is
it consistent with the observation that Nia-L species observed
in Group 1 O2-tolerant hydrogenases, even in the dark and
at ambient temperature, tend to be biased toward lower wavenumber
species and are likely to have a deprotonated active site (vide infra, Figure 10A). The energy
landscape at the Nia-C/L redox level is therefore presumably
relatively flat, at least in terms of the energy difference between
the range of available protonation sites, as shown in previous DFT
studies that included a NiI intermediate.9,10 The distance over which the proton can transfer in the Nia-L state(s) during catalysis is likely to depend upon the rate of
electron transfer from the active site to the proximal cluster at
the midpoint potential of the Nia-SI/Nia-L redox
couple. In the case of the O2-tolerant E.
coli Hyd-1 both the proximal and medial iron sulfur
clusters have potentials significantly more positive than the Nia-SI/Nia-L couple and so are reduced, and therefore
fully occupied, when the active site is at the Nia-C/Nia-L redox level (although there is no direct experimental evidence
at present reporting on the redox behavior of the iron sulfur relay
during turnover). This would retard the electron transfer required
for conversion of Nia-L to Nia-SI, which could
then become rate-limiting. Under these circumstances, it is possible
that the proton associated with Nia-L could travel further
along the proton-transfer pathway than the glutamate acceptor. This
idea of multiple proton acceptor sites for Nia-L states
of E. coli Hyd-1 is consistent with
the data reported by Murphy et al.,36 where
the pH-dependence of the relative populations of Nia-C
and Nia-L does not fit a simple single proton equilibrium
for the Nia-C to Nia-L transition. Figure 11A shows a pH titration
equivalent to that reported by Murphy et al.,36 but now focusing on the pH-dependent populations of Nia-C and the two low νCO Nia-L states of E. coli Hyd-1 separately. It is clear that, in this
case, the two Nia-L species correspond either to unique
proton acceptor sites with quite different pKa values, or a single proton acceptor site with multiple pH-dependent
conformations, the origin of which is unclear at present. Low wavenumber
νCO Nia-L states have also been observed
in the O2-tolerant Hase 1 from A. aeolicus (Table 1 and Figure 10A). Molecular dynamics
simulations of proton transport in A. aeolicus Hase 1 by Sacquin-Mora and co-workers112 have revealed that the proton-accepting glutamate residue E13 (Glu13,
circled in Figure 11B, and equivalent to E28 in E. coli Hyd-1) is conformationally flexible and takes up two orientations;
30% of the residues have the carboxylate side chain oriented toward
the active site (Figure 11B, purple), with 70% oriented toward the iron sulfur clusters
and two glutamate residues, E118 and E58, in the small subunit (Figure 11B, orange). In
contrast, the equivalent residue in D. vulgaris MF [NiFe] hydrogenase was more conformationally rigid in the simulations.
Sacquin-Mora and co-workers postulate that the conformational flexibility
of glutamate might increase the rate of proton transfer to and from
the active site.112 It is interesting to
note that an increased rate of proton transfer via conformational
flexibility of a glutamate residue has been observed in similar molecular
dynamics simulations of the FeFe hydrogenase from Clostridium
pasterianum.113 It is possible
that the two low νCO Nia-L states observed
in E. coli Hyd-1 and A. aeolicus Hase 1 correspond to protons located
on the E13-equivalent glutamate residue (A. aeolicus numbering, E28 in E. coli Hyd-1)
in both the conformations shown in Figure 11B, although this will require further investigation.
While this description of the low wavenumber νCO Nia-L states in O2-tolerant hydrogenases is appealing,
it is important to keep in mind the caveat that these states could
be off-pathway species in fast equilibrium with catalytically active
states. At present, the only Nia-L states109 conclusively demonstrated as on-pathway intermediates are
those described by Dyer and co-workers for P. furiosus SH1.41,42

and Nia-LIII (orange diamonds) states as determined

same protonation site. (B) Conformational flexibility of a conserved

Implications of Multiple Nia-R
States on the [NiFe]
Hydrogenase Mechanism
Figure 10B shows that the Nia-R states
can also be split into three distinct groupings of νCO positions relative to the νCO of Nia-C, which correspond to the Nia-RI, Nia-RII, and Nia-RIII states.
(In calculating the averages and standard deviations used in Figure 10B, we have omitted
the νCO positions of R. eutropha SH; these are less well-characterized and display obvious discrepancies
with the other hydrogenases, although we have plotted the data for
comparison.) As is the case for the Nia-L states, only
one Nia-R substate is widely discussed in the literature.
The highest wavenumber state, Nia-RI, tends
to be the target of theoretical modeling of experimental data,91 is the predominant state in crystals from which
Ogata and co-workers have reported a high resolution X-ray structure,11 and is the state implicated in computational
studies of the [NiFe] hydrogenase mechanism.8−10 Therefore,
this is the representation most commonly used for “the Nia-R state” (Figure 4A) even for hydrogenases where the Nia-RI state is only a minority species (R. eutropha MBH, for example) or has not been observed at all (A. aeolicus Hase 1, for example), and despite the
fact that the crystal samples (D. vulgaris MF) used for structural characterization also contained up to 18%
of the Nia-RII state. Thus, there are clearly
open questions regarding the relationship between the Nia-R substates. Also included in Figure 10B (open diamonds) are relative νCO values from DFT calculations of the Nia-R state
both with cysteine thiolate protonation and a bridging hydride (as
shown in Figure 4A)
and as a deprotonated model in which only the bridging hydride is
retained.91 The DFT calculations accurately
reproduce both the experimental νCO positions relative
to Nia-C and the difference in νCO between
the Nia-RI and Nia-RIII states. Therefore, it is possible that the three Nia-R
states represent successive proton-transfer steps away from the active
site following initial heterolytic cleavage of H2.

As was the case with the Nia-L states the highest νCO Nia-R state, Nia-RI, tends
to dominate in spectra of the Group 1 O2-sensitive hydrogenases,
whereas either Nia-RII or Nia-RIII are the majority species for Group 1 O2-tolerant
hydrogenases. In the case of E. coli Hyd-1, the Nia-RI state has not been observed
during turnover and nonturnover studies carried out over a wide pH
range.35,36 If our interpretation of the Nia-RII and Nia-RIII states as having
a proton somewhat removed from the primary coordination sphere of
the active site is correct, then the lack of a Nia-RI species for E. coli Hyd-1
is consistent with the mechanism proposed by Armstrong and co-workers54 (Figure 7A): heterolytic cleavage of H2 via a frustrated
Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism, with the guanidinium group of an arginine
residue in the active site canopy as the initial proton acceptor,
results in a bridging hydride between Ni and Fe and a deprotonated
active site. It should be noted, however, that this observation is
not universally true for Group 1 O2-tolerant hydrogenases
as a Nia-RI state is observed
in R. eutropha MBH. If a FLP mechanism
is occurring in E. coli Hyd-1, it might
be expected that only one Nia-R state should be observed,
rather than two. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy
is that one of either Nia-RII or Nia-RIII might be closely related to the Michaelis–Menten
complex between H2 and the [NiFe] active site, although
further structural, kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical work would
be needed to test this hypothesis. It is also possible that alternative
proton-transfer routes exist and this would be consistent with the
observation that a low-level of activity (1% native activity) is still
observed in the R509K variant of E. coli Hyd-1 (Figure 6B,C),
and that 20% native activity remains after exchange of one or both
of the highly conserved aspartic acid residues in the active site
canopy (D118 and D574) with asparagine (Figure 6B). A proton-transfer pathway has been proposed
that terminates at an aspartic acid residue connected via a salt bridge
to R509.17 The mutagenesis studies suggest
that these aspartic acid residues are not essential for proton transfer,
and Armstrong and co-workers note several crystallographically ordered
water molecules in the vicinity of R509 that could mediate proton
transfer.54Figure 12 shows the position of these water molecules
in wild-type Hyd-1; similar conserved water structures are evident
in membrane bound hydrogenases from Hydrogenovibrio
marinus,64R. eutropha,65 and D. vulgaris MF.11 An additional
water molecule is present in the R509K variant (Figure 12, blue sphere), and it is
possible that proton transfer mediated by this water molecule is responsible
for the residual activity of the R509K variant.

Figure 12 Active-site region of
[NiFe] hydrogenases contain ordered crystallographic
water molecules, demonstrated here for E. coli Hyd-1.54 The water molecules denoted
in red spheres were found to be highly conserved in a range of Hyd-1
variants, whereas an additional water (blue sphere) was present in
the R509K variant reported by Armstrong and co-workers. A stereo view

The range of Nia-R states observed for different [NiFe]
hydrogenases remains largely unexplained, although here we have suggested
that the different Nia-R states, as with the Nia-L states, could represent steps involved in proton transfer during
catalysis. The fact that amino acid mutations of basic residues close
to the active site do not completely suppress activity suggests that
multiple pathways, or a range of possible initial acceptor sites,
exist for proton transfer. Understanding is still lacking on an initial
H2 complex. Spectroscopic study of the base-variants around
the active site will be informative in assessing the roles of these
residues during H2 activation.

4 Summary
and Outlook
Recent spectroscopic studies have confirmed the
involvement of
Nia-SI, Nia-R, and Nia-C in the [NiFe]
hydrogenase catalytic cycle, and these studies also reinforce the
likely importance of a range of NiI species, Nia-L, as on-pathway intermediates between Nia-C and Nia-SI. Two mechanisms have been proposed for initial splitting
of H2 during the transition from Nia-SI to Nia-R, with either a Ni-bound terminal thiolate or a highly conserved
arginine residue acting as the primary proton acceptor. The initial
proton acceptor during the transition from Nia-C to Nia-L is thought to be the terminal cysteine thiolate, with a
conserved glutamate residue demonstrated to be important for proton
transfer beyond the active site. The postulation of a single acceptor
site for each of these proton-transfer steps is appealing in its simplicity
but belies the fact that multiple Nia-L and Nia-R states are observed. Proton-transfer pathways have been postulated
that terminate close to both the conserved arginine and the terminal
cysteine thiolates, and so it is possible (likely, even) that the
two protons produced during H2 oxidation leave the active
site region by different routes.

By considering data from across
the range of [NiFe] hydrogenases
that have been studied using vibrational spectroscopy, we have identified
broad trends in the relative energies of νCO vibrations,
and we suggest that these can be interpreted in terms of protonation
behavior in the vicinity of the active site. In particular, we note
that the relative energies of the νCO bands of the
Nia-L and Nia-R states each fall into groupings
that are consistent with theoretical calculations for protonation
and deprotonation of the primary coordination sphere of Ni at the
[NiFe] active site. We therefore propose that the collection of Nia-L and Nia-R states could represent rapid equilibration
of the protons produced during the transitions from Nia-SI to Nia-R and from Nia-C to Nia-L to multiple acceptor sites along the first stages in proton-transfer
pathway(s) leading to the enzyme surface.

In the case of states
at the Nia-C/Nia-L
redox level, interconversion between distinct Nia-L states
is observed, in both time-resolved and static IR measurements, supporting
the involvement of at least two Nia-L species during the
transition from Nia-C to Nia-SI. The distance
over which the proton can travel, and therefore, which Nia-L states are involved for any given hydrogenase, depends upon the
relative rates of proton- and electron-transfer away from the active
site. The rate of electron transfer will depend upon the ability of
the proximal iron sulfur cluster to accept an electron, which requires
the cluster to be (at least transiently) at the oxidized redox level.
Several different proximal clusters are found in [NiFe] hydrogenases
with reduction potentials that vary over a wide range: from very low
potentials (<−0.5 V, as in R. eutropha RH), through O2-sensitive Group 1 hydrogenases (where
the proximal cluster potential is close to the potential of the Nia-C(L)/Nia-SI couple), to the O2-tolerant
Group 1 hydrogenases, which have very high potential proximal clusters
(>0 V in E. coli Hyd-1). The rate
of
this electron-transfer step is likely to vary widely between different
hydrogenases.

Open questions about the [NiFe] hydrogenase mechanism
concern proton
and electron-transfer steps as well as the initial mode of activation
of H2. Different mechanistic pathways may be present in
different groups of hydrogenases, and perhaps even within groups,
so a common mechanism may not apply to all [NiFe] hydrogenases. Instead,
it is possible that the [NiFe] active site provides a mechanistically
flexible framework that can support H2-cycling via a range
of pathways depending upon factors such as the potentials of clusters
in the iron sulfur relay, solution pH, and the exact location of proton
acceptor sites. Genetic variants are becoming available that are designed
to affect specific steps in the [NiFe] catalytic cycle. The novel
transient and turnover IR techniques discussed in this Perspective
should be particularly informative when applied to these variants
to elucidate the mechanistic significance of specific amino acid residues
around the active site in hydrogenases from different Groups and different
organisms within these Groups.

Dyer and co-workers have
relabeled the Nia-L states they observe in P. furiosus SH1 as “Nia-I”
to reflect their role as
active intermediates. However, we prefer the reclassification as Nia-L to reflect a role in catalysis while maintaining a link
with existing literature on the Ni-L states.
