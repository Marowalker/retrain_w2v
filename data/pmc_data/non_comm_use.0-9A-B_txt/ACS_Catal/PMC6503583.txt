Base-metal
catalyzed dehydrogenative self-coupling of 2-amino alcohols
to selectively form functionalized 2,5-substituted pyrazine derivatives
is presented. Also, 2-substituted quinoxaline derivatives are synthesized
by dehydrogenative coupling of 1,2-diaminobenzene and 1,2-diols. In
both cases, water and hydrogen gas are formed as the sole byproducts.
The reactions are catalyzed by acridine-based pincer complexes of
earth-abundant manganese.

Aromatic N-heterocycles
are found in diverse bioactive natural products and in essential intermediates
for fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural chemicals.1 Along with metal-free classical methods, metal-catalyzed
multicomponent coupling or cyclization reactions were also developed
for the production of N-heteroaromatic molecules.2 Although synthetically useful, disadvantages
of most of these reactions include multistep synthetic procedure,
poor availability of starting materials, and copious waste generation.
Alternative strategies based on one-step, sustainable, atom-economical
efficient methodologies using inexpensive starting material for the
preparation of valuable N-heteroaromatic molecules
are desirable. In this regard, pyridine- or acridine-based pincer
catalysts were explored by our group for several environmentally benign
reactions with liberation of H2 and/or water as the only
by-products.3 Indeed, notable progress
has been made in recent years in sustainable synthesis of N-heteroaromatic molecules, such as substituted pyrrole,
pyridine, benzimidazole, quinoline and pyrimidines derivatives, based
on the acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols and amines using complexes
based on noble metals, mainly Ir and Ru (see Scheme 1).4−9

Scheme 1 Synthesis of N-Heteroaromatics via Dehydrogenative
Coupling of Alcohols and Amines Catalyzed by Noble- or Base-Metal
Complexes
The replacement of
noble-metal-based catalysts by catalysts based
on low-toxicity, earth-abundant base metals is a significant current
direction in homogeneous catalysis. In recent years, base-metal catalysts
were employed in various (de)hydrogenation reactions.10 The synthesis of N-heteroaromatic compounds
by dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with amine derivatives catalyzed
by base-metals were also reported.11

Pyrazines are an important class of N-heteroaromatic
derivatives. Pyrazine derivatives show antibacterial, antitumor, and
antibiotic activities, and they are also used in cancer experimental
drugs.12 Various types of polypyrazine
derivatives are also used in the polymer industry as conjugated polymers.13

Methods for preparation of pyrazine derivatives
are limited. Industrially,
they are synthesized by condensation of ethylenediamine with vicinal
diols such as propylene glycol using heterogeneous catalysts.14a The dehydrogenative coupling of α-amino
carbonyl or α-diketones with vicinal diamines are the standard
protocol for pyrazine synthesis.15

Pyrazines are also synthesized using α-halo ketones16 or by the condensation reaction of diamines
and epoxides.17 Dehydrogenation of piperazines
to form pyrazine derivatives was also reported using heterogeneous
catalysts.14a

The dehydrogenative
coupling of 2-amino-alcohols to form 2,5-disubstituted
symmetrical pyrazines homogeneously catalyzed by a Ru(BPyPNN)-pincer
complex was reported by our group.18 Following
the recent development of manganese-based catalysts in our laboratory,19 we explored the possibility of dehydrogenative
coupling of β-amino-alcohol derivatives. Recently, the synthesis
of 2,5-diphenylpyrazine was reported via dehydrogenative coupling
of 2-phenylglycinol catalyzed by a Co complex in the presence of a
stoichiometric amount of base (with respect to substrate), generating
stoichiometric waste, and requiring an extra post-reaction process
for product isolation.20 To the best of
our knowledge, dehydrogenative self-coupling of β-amino alcohols
to form 2,5-substituted pyrazine derivatives with the extrusion of
H2 and water catalyzed by a complex of an earth-abundant
metal and a catalytic amount of base has not been reported. Herein,
we present an acridine-based manganese pincer complex that catalyzes
the formation of pyrazines by dehydrogenative coupling of 1,2-aminoalcohol
derivatives, as well as the formation of quinoxalines by dehydrogenative
coupling of 1,2-diaminobenzene with 1,2-vicinal diols.

Treatment
of our previously reported Acr-PNPPh (Acr-PNPPh = 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-acridine, HAcr-PNPPh = 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9H-acridine-10-ide)
ligand21 with Mn(CO)5Br at 60
°C in THF
led to the formation of a new manganese complex Mn(Acr-PNPPh)(CO)2Br (1) in 96% yield (Scheme 2). Single crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) were obtained by slow
evaporation of a saturated solution of THF. The X-ray structure of 1 exhibits an octahedral geometry with meridional coordination
of the Acr-PNPPh ligand, two mutually cis carbonyl ligands
and a bromide ligand (see Figure 1, as well as the Supporting Information
(SI)).

Figure 1 X-ray structure of complexes 1 and 2.
Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level. Selected
hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. For selected bond lengths
and angles, see the SI.

Interestingly, the reaction of complex 1 with
an excess
of sodium borohydride formed the novel azaborametallacyclic complex 2. Only a few complexes bearing such an azaborametallacycle
are known.22 The reduction of the acridine
ring in the C9 position was clearly confirmed by the 1H
NMR spectrum. In addition, a sharp peak at −7.4 ppm (corresponding
to one proton) and a broad peak at 2.1 ppm (corresponding to two protons)
indicate the presence of the BH3 moiety. The presence of
the two mutually cis carbonyl ligands was confirmed by IR spectroscopy
(1940 cm–1, 1868 cm–1, 1:1 for cis CO, and 2424 cm–1, 2347 cm–1 for BH3 moiety). Single crystals of 2 suitable
for XRD study were obtained by slow diffusion of pentane into a saturated
solution of 2 in THF at −30 °C. The molecular
structure exhibits an octahedral geometry with meridional coordination
of the dearomatized HAcr-PNPPh ligand. The two carbonyl
ligands occupy cis positions of the octahedral metal center. The BH2 group forms a bridging unit between the acridine-N atom and
one of the manganese-bound hydrides (H1a) forming a four-membered
metallacycle. The Mn–Ha bond distance is 1.708 Å and the
Mn···B distance is 2.309 Å. The nitrogen atom
of the ligand is coordinated to the metal center and to the boron
atom of the BH3 moiety (B–N = 1.578 Å, Mn–N
= 2.077 Å). One of the hydride ligands (H) that bridges between
manganese and boron shows a considerably longer B–H bond (1.238
Å) than the other two B–H bonds (1.067 and 1.124 Å)
in the BH3 moiety.

To explore the catalytic activity,
a toluene solution of 2-phenylglycinol
was heated at 150 °C for 24 h in the presence of complex 2 (2 mol %) and KH as base (3 mol %) in a closed
system, affording 2,5-diphenylpyrazine in 99% yield, as determined
by GCMS (Table 1, entry
1). Using THF or 1,4-dioxane as a solvent under the same condition
resulted in 90% and 95% yields of the product, respectively (Table 1, entries 2 and 3).
Lowering the reaction temperature to 125 °C for 24 h resulted
in quantitative product formation in toluene. Similarly, when the
reaction time was reduced to 12 h under the same conditions at 150
°C in toluene, a quantitative formation of product was observed
(Table 1, entries 4
and 5). A reaction conducted in an open system under Ar flow resulted
in 92% conversion, indicating that the evolved hydrogen in a closed
system does not affect the reaction process significantly (Table 1, entry 6). In the
absence of any base, under the same conditions, only a trace amount
of 2,5-diphenylpyrazine was detected (Table 1, entry 7). Using tBuOK and NaOMe under the optimized conditions resulted in poor
yields (15% and 10%, respectively), whereas using NaOEt resulted in
81% yield of the product 2,5-diphenylpyrazine under the same conditions
(Table 1, entries 8–10).
Significantly, the addition of 300 equiv of Hg to the catalytic solution
showed no decrease in product formation or selectivity (Table 1, entry 11), which was suggestive
of a homogeneous catalytic pathway.

Our previously reported PNP, PNNH, and PNHP–Mn pincer complexes 3,19a4,19d and 5(19c) (Table 1) were then
screened. Surprisingly, using the tBu-substituted complex 3 resulted in only 24% yield of 2,5-diphenylpyrazine at 150
°C (Table 1, entry
12), probably because of steric hindrance, whereas the PNNH-Mn catalyst 4 produced 23% of the pyrazine derivative at 40% conversion,
with the formation of some unidentified products (Table 1, entry 13). Complex 5 selectively yielded 64% of the 2,5-diphenylpyrazine as product (Table 1, entry 14). Complex 1 was also used as catalyst under same conditions, yielding
95% of the product (Table 1, entry 15).

Using the optimized reaction conditions,
in the presence of catalyst 2 (2 mol %) and 3
mol % of KH in toluene at
150 °C (bath temperature), various β-amino alcohols were
studied in a closed system. Employing 2-amino-3-phenylpropane1-ol
resulted in 95% yield of the 2,5-dibenzylpyrazine product (Table 2, entry 1), whereas
upon use of 2-amino-3-methylbutane-1-ol 86% yield of the 2,5-diisopropylpyrazine
product was obtained (Table 2, entry 2). Reaction of 2-amino-4-methylpentane-1-ol yielded
80% of the corresponding pyrazine derivative under the optimized reaction
conditions (Table 2, entry 3). 2-Amino-1-hexanol and 2-amino-1-pentanol as substrates
yielded 65% and 95% of the corresponding pyrazine derivatives, respectively
(Table 2, entries 4
and 5). 2-Aminobutane-1-ol gave 40% of the 2,5-diethylpyrazine product,
whereas use of 2-aminopropane-1-ol resulted in full conversion, yielding
45% of the 2,5-dimethylpyrazine product (Table 2, entries 6 and 7). The difference in β-amino
alcohol conversion and yield of product pyrazine, as observed in Table 2, indicates the formation
of a mixture of unidentified products. Using pyrrolidin-2-yl-methanol
as a substrate afforded the tricyclic ring system. 2,3,5a,6,7,8-Hexahydro-1H,5H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1′,2′-d]pyrazine
was detected in 30% yield with other unidentified side products (Table 2, entry 8). At this
point, we should mention that the sulfur functionalized methioninol
was not reactive under the same reaction conditions. No trace of the
corresponding pyrazine derivatives was found, only 10% of defunctionalized
2,5-diethylpyrazine was observed, with the rest being unreacted methioninol.

Benzopyrazine, also named quinoxaline,
is a heterocyclic compound
containing a fused benzene ring with a pyrazine ring. The development
of efficient methods for the synthesis of quinoxalines is essential
due to their significant application in several fields, including
pharmaceuticals and advanced materials. The well-established method
for quinoxalines synthesis is the condensation of 1,2-aryldiamines
with 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds to afford good to moderate yields.23 Many improved methods have been reported using
various approaches.24 The dehydrogenative
approach for quinoxalines from 1,2-phenylenediamines and vicinal-diols
was studied using noble-metal catalysts; however, in all cases, more
than a stoichiometric amount of base was needed.8b,9 Recently,
a similar transformation catalyzed by a Co complex was reported, requiring
a stoichiometric amount of base and excess of diol, which generates
waste and exhibits poor atom economy.25 Here, we explore the dehydrogenative coupling reaction of 1,2-diaminobenzene
and vicinal 1,2-diol derivative by catalyst 2 under the
above-mentioned optimized conditions.

The treatment of an equivalent
amount of 1,2-diaminobenzene and
1,2-butanediol in the presence of catalyst 2 (2 mol %)
and KH (3 mol %) at 150 °C for 36 h in a closed system
afforded 2-ethylquinoxaline (95%) as the product (Table 3, entry 1). Under the same conditions
1,2-hexanediol afforded 2-butylquinoxaline (40%) with 5% hydrogenated
product 2-butyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline (Table 3, entry 2). 1,2-Decanediol afforded 94% (Table 3, entry 3) conversion,
where 49% of the corresponding quinoxaline derivative and 24% of the
hydrogenated product were formed, in addition to unidentified high-molecular-weight
products. 1,2-Tetradecanediol underwent 95% conversion to form the
quinoxaline product (65%) and the hydrogenated product (35%) (Table 3, entry 4). 4-Methyl-1,2-diaminobenzene
exhibited similar activity with the long-chain vicinal diol substrate
to form the corresponding quinoxaline derivative. With 1,2-tetradecanediol
and 1,2-decanediol as substrates, 75% and 74% of the corresponding
quinoxaline derivatives were formed as major products, respectively,
together with their two hydrogenated isomers (Table 3, entries 5 and 6; for isomer details, see
the SI).

product shown in parentheses). c4-Methyl-1,2-diaminobenzene

Although long-chain
vicinal diols are effective using a catalytic
amount of base, the short-chain 1,2-diols require stoichiometric amounts
of base to form the corresponding quinoxaline product. Reaction of
1,2-propanediol (0.5 mmol) and 1,2-diaminobenzene (0.5 mmol) in the
presence of 0.5 mmol of KH and catalyst 2 afforded 90%
2-methylquinoxaline (Table 3, entry 7). Ethylene glycol afforded 35% of the quinoxaline
as the final product (Table 3, entry 8). The substituted 4-methyl-1,2-diaminobenzene also
shows the same activity with 1,2-propanediol and 1,2-butanediol as
substrates, affording 78% and 82% of the corresponding quinoxaline
derivatives, respectively (Table 3, entries 9 and 10). Reaction of 1,2-hexanediol with
4-methyl-1,2-diaminobenzene resulted in 99% conversion, including
80% of the corresponding quinoxaline product and 20% of the hydrogenated
2-butyl-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline product (Table 3, entry 11). The treatment of
1,2-diaminobenzene and 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol afforded 2-phenylquinoxaline
(75%) as the product under similar conditions (Table 3, entry 12).

To gain mechanistic insight
of the pyrazine and quinoxaline formation
reactions by the dehydrogenative coupling, some control experiments
were performed. Treatment of benzyl alcohol in the presence of catalyst 2 (2 mol %) and a catalytic amount of base (KH, 3 mol %)
at 150 °C for 24 h in a closed system afforded benzyl benzoate
as the final product (99%) (see Scheme 3a). The reaction of 0.5 mmol of benzyl alcohol and
0.5 mmol of 1-hexylamine in the presence of catalyst 2 (2 mol %) and KH (3 mol %) at 150 °C for 24 h
in a closed system afforded a quantitative amount of N-benzylidenehexylamine as the only product (see Scheme 3b). These experiments show
that catalyst 2 can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenative
coupling of the alcohol.

Scheme 3 Control Experiments
In a control experiment, using only 1,2-hexanediol or
1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol
and catalyst 2 and base, no reaction occurred under the
optimized reaction conditions (see Scheme 3c). However, treatment of an equivalent amount
of 1,2-hexanediol and aniline in the presence of catalyst 2 under the same conditions afforded 10% of 1-(phenylamino)hexan-2-ol
(Scheme 3d), indicating
that the dehydrogenation equilibrium of the vicinal diol is unfavorable
and is shifted by coupling with the amine reactant. In another control
experiment, under the same conditions, diphenylmethanol afforded only
10% of benzophenone as the dehydrogenated product, which indicates
that dehydrogenation of the primary alcohol is more favorable than
that of the secondary alcohol (see Schemes 3e and 3a).

According
to our observations, a plausible mechanism of the organic
intermediates involved is proposed in Scheme 4. Dehydrogenation of the β-amino alcohol
derivative catalyzed by 2 yields an aldehyde intermediate
that undergoes self-coupling with another molecule, leading to 2,5-dihydropyrazine
derivatives via the elimination of two molecules of water. The 2,5-dihydropyrazine
then undergoes rapid metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation, eliminating
a molecule of dihydrogen and forming a stable aromatic pyrazine derivative.
Formation of the cyclic intermediate was confirmed when pyrrolidin-2-yl-methanol
was employed in the reaction, leading to 2,3,5a,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H,5H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1′,2′-d]pyrazine
(molecular mass = 164) as a product, since the further dehydrogenation
to form the aromatic pyrazine is not possible for this substrate (see Table 2, entry 8).

Scheme 4 Proposed
Mechanism for the Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions Leading
to the Formation of Pyrazine and Quinoxaline
The dehydrogenative coupling of 1,2-diaminobenzene and
vicinal
diols to form quinoxalines also follows initial dehydrogenation of
the terminal alcohol group of the 1,2-diol system. Condensation of
the amine group of the 1,2-diaminobenzene with the carbonyl moiety
leads to intermediate I that, upon a proton shift, forms II, which undergoes tautomerization to intermediate III (see Scheme 4). Condensation with a second amine group leads to the formation
of a 1,2-dihydroquinoxaline derivative, which undergoes rapid dehydrogenation
to form the quinoxaline derivative as the final product.

In
order to gain further mechanistic insight, we tried to isolate
possible active organometallic amido intermediate without the boron-bridged
moiety. The treatment of catalyst 2 with 2 equiv of benzyl
amine for 2 h at 80 °C showed a new peak in 31P NMR
spectroscopy at 78.6 ppm. Interestingly, 1H NMR spectroscopy
showed the disappearance of the bound BH signal of
complex 2 at −7.4 ppm, which is suggestive of
the displacement of the bound BH moiety by benzyl amine and formation
of complex 6. However, attempts to isolate the new complex 6 were not successful. The bridged BH3 moiety was
completely intact when complex 2 was treated with excess
of NEt3 or any primary alcohol. On the other hand, upon
treatment of 2 with NH3 (1 bar), the bridged
BH3 peak at −7.4 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum
disappear upon heating the reaction mixture at 80 °C for 30 min,
whereas little shift was observed in the 31P NMR spectrum.
The 11B NMR spectrum showed a doublet at 28.1 ppm and a
singlet at 25.4 ppm, which could possibly result from the dehydrogenated
product of the ammonia–borane adduct. Finally, crystallization
from pentane THF mixture at −30 °C afforded yellow crystals
of complex 7 in 85% yield (see Scheme 5). XRD analysis unambiguously showed a neutral
octahedral ammonia-coordinated manganese complex 7 bearing
a hydrogenated acridine ring containing a pincer ligand and two mutually
cis CO ligands. Single-crystal X-ray structure revealed a long-range
hydrogen bonding (2.546 Å) between a proton of ammonia and the
acridine nitrogen, which suggests that the weakly basic acridine nitrogen
may be capable of accepting the hydroxy proton of the alcohol during
the alcohol dehydrogenation process (see the SI for the mechanism). Complexes 6 and 7 do
not dehydrogenate the alcohol under neutral conditions, whereas both
the complexes are equally active compared to 2 for the
pyrazine formation reaction in the presence of catalytic amount of
base. A toluene solution of 2-phenylglycinol was heated at 150 °C
for 24 h in the presence of the isolated complex 7 (2
mol %) without any base in a closed system afforded only 8%
of the 2,5-diphenylpyrazine (the amino group of 2-phenylglycinol acts
as a weak base; see the next experiment), whereas the addition of
3 mol % KH as the base afforded 99% of the product under the
same conditions. Under the similar condition in situ generated complex 6 and base also showed the similar
activity with 99% yield of the 2,5-diphenylpyrazine. Treatment of
complex 2 with 2 equiv of 2-amino-1-propanol in a sealed
NMR tube afforded a new complex 8, which is probably
the amine-bound species showing a peak at 76.4 ppm in 31P NMR spectroscopy, along with a broad peak at 72 ppm. The addition
of a base to the reaction mixture and heating afforded the pyrazine
derivative as detected by GCMS. To obtain the active amido intermediate,
complex 1 was treated with NaH in the presence of benzyl
alcohol in THF.26 However, a tricarbonyl
Mn complex bearing a reduced acridine ligand, which is not catalytically
active, was obtained (see the SI for details).
Alternatively, treatment of 1 with an equivalent of NaBEt3H afforded an unstable Mn–H compound (−5.2 ppm
in 1H NMR, and 90.2 ppm in 31P NMR spectroscopy)
that undergoes rapid reductive disproportionation to form an NMR silent
compound. Reaction of complex 2 in the presence of alcohol
and a catalytic amount of base afforded a broad signal at 72 ppm in
the 31P NMR spectrum but complete characterization of the
generated species was unsuccessful. A five-coordinated amido species
may play an active role in the alcohol dehydrogenation process, and,
because of the less basic nature of the amido nitrogen of the ligand,
alkoxide-assisted alcohol dehydrogenation and dihydrogen liberation
mechanism probably occur (see the SI).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Complexes 6, 7, and 8
In conclusion, 2,5-dialkyl-substituted
symmetrical pyrazine derivatives
were synthesized by the dehydrogenative self-coupling of 2-aminoalcohols.
Quinoxaline derivatives were also synthesized by dehydrogenative coupling
of 1,2-diaminobenzene and 1,2-diols. Both reactions are catalyzed
by a novel complex of the earth-abundant manganese, complex 2, and generate hydrogen gas and water as the only byproducts,
making these synthetic methods atom-economical, environmentally benign,
and sustainable. The relevant acridine-based manganese complexes were
also prepared. The reaction plausibly proceeds via alcohol dehydrogenation,
followed by coupling with amines.
