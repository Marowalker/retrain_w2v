2-Alkenylphenols
react with allenes, upon treatment with catalytic
amounts of Pd(II) and Cu(II), to give benzoxepine products in high
yields and with very good regio- and diastereoselectivities. This
contrasts with the results obtained with Rh catalysts, which provided
chromene-like products through a pathway involving a β-hydrogen
elimination step. Computational studies suggest that the square planar
geometry of the palladium is critical to favor the reductive elimination
process required for the formation of the oxepine products.

==== Body
Heterocyclic compounds are prevalent
in medicinal chemistry, and therefore, there is a continued interest
in the development of practical methods for their assembly from simple
precursors.1 In this context, the use of
synthetic protocols involving transition-metal-catalyzed C–H
functionalizations is especially appealing.2 In recent years, there has been an increasing number of reports
on the assembly of heterocycles through annulation reactions involving
C–H activation processes. While most of these reactions use
alkynes, alkenes, or carbon monoxide as cycloaddition partners,3,4 allenes, which are highly attractive owing to their intrinsic reactivity
and versatility, have been very scarcely employed.5

Recently we found that 2-alkenylphenols can react
with allenes
upon treatment with Cp*Rh(III) catalysts to give chromene-type products
(A, Scheme 1A).6 The reaction, which can be formally viewed as
a (5 + 1) annulation, was proposed to involve the activation of the
terminal olefinic sp2 C–H bond, followed by allene insertion
to generate a π-allyl intermediate like B (Scheme 1B). This complex evolves to
the product through β-hydrogen elimination followed by two consecutive
pericyclic rearrangements of the resulting triene. We envisioned that
moving from Cp*Rh to a Pd complex, and therefore from a pseudo-octahedral
to a square planar geometry, might favor the reductive elimination
processes in intermediates of type C and hence the generation of appealing
benzooxepine products.

Scheme 1 Rh(III) vs Pd(II) Annulation of ortho-Alkenylphenols
with Allenes
Herein we demonstrate
that indeed readily available 2-alkenylphenols
can react with a broad range of allenes in a formal (5 + 2) cycloaddition
when treated with Pd(II) catalysts under oxidative conditions (Scheme 1C). The reaction
provides a wide variety of interesting benzoxepine products in high
yields and with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivties (E/Z).

We started our research by
assaying the reaction between alkenylphenol 1a and phenylallene 2a. The initial conditions
consisted of heating of a 1.5:1 mixture of both substrates with Pd(OAc)2 at 85 °C, in acetonitrile, in the presence of 0.5 equiv
of Cu(OAc)2, and under air. After 6 h, the crude 1H NMR showed the formation of a mixture of three adducts that were
identified as the desired oxepines 3aa (5.3:1 ratio of E/Z isomers) and the regioisomeric oxepine 4aa, in a 1.8:1 ratio.7 Albeit
the regioselectivity was low, the reaction took place with a good
overall yield of 76% (Table 1). While using tert-amyl alcohol as solvent
led to lower conversions (entry 2), changing to toluene improved the
isomeric ratios (entry 3). We then tested the effect of some additives
with coordinating ability like pyridine or 2-phenylpyridine, or bidentate
derivatives like 4,5-diazafluoren-9-one, but the efficiency of the
reaction was lower (entries 4–6). However, in the presence
of 7.5% 2,2′-bipyridine (2,2′-Bipy) the reaction led
to a good yield of the 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]oxepines
(84% yield), which were produced with very good regio- and diastereoselective
ratios (entry 7).

We then investigated
the scope of the reaction with regard to the
allene component (Scheme 2). In most of the cases, the standard conditions of entry
1 (Table 1) gave very
good yields of the adducts without the need of additives (conditions
A), but in some cases, the conditions with Bipy were beneficial (conditions
B).

E:Z = 2.7:1.

E:Z = 3.2:1.

Therefore, the symmetrical 1,3-disubstituted
allenes 1,3-diphenylpropa-1,2-diene
(2b) and 4,5-nonadiene (2c) provided the
corresponding products 3ab and 3ac with
good yield and excellent E:Z ratios. Similarly the
cyclic allene cyclonona-1,2-diene led to the expected product 3ad as only product. 1,1-Disubsubstituted allenes are also
efficient cycloaddition partners (3ae-3ag obtained in
71–92% yield) with excellent regioselectivities. Monosubstituted
allenes like phenylallene or cyclohexylallene also participated in
the process, leading to the products 3ah and 3ai in 69 and 71% yields, respectively. In these cases, we found that
using 2,2′-bipyridine as additive is important in order to
achieve good selectivities. Finally, we tested two trisubstituted
allenes that led to the products 4aj and 4ak in excellent yields and selectivities. These allenes favored the
formation of regioisomers featuring challenging tetrasubstituted carbons
in the cyclic framework, probably because of the preferred formation
of phenyl-conjugated products.

As shown in the Scheme 3, the reaction is not restricted
to 2-alkenylphenols like 1a but also works with related
substrates bearing other substituents
at the internal position of the alkene, such as ethyl or phenyl, and
is also efficient with 2-hydroxystyrene; however, in this case, a
small amount of the other regioisomer is formed. In all the cases
the expected oxepine adducts were obtained in excellent yields (4bj-4dj, 71–88% yields). We also analyzed the reactivity
of precursors with different substituents in the phenyl moiety of
the alkenylphenol.

Substituents in para position to the alkenyl group
are well-tolerated irrespective of whether they are electron donors
(4ej, 80% yield) or electron withdrawing (4fj8 and 4gj, 95% and 97% yield,
respectively). Similarly, aromatic substrates with substituents para to the hydroxyl group work very well (4hj and 4ij, 70–72% yield), as occurs with disubstituted
derivatives 1j, 1k, and 1l (65–89%
yield of products). Interestingly, substrates with substituents at
the terminal position of the alkene such as 1m and 1n also worked, producing the corresponding products in 64%
and 77% yield as single isomers. This is noteworthy because previous
Rh-catalyzed annulation processes failed with this type of alkenes.6,3c,3d Finally, and as expected, allenes
other than 2j can be used with different alkenylphenols
(see for instance 3de).

Overall, the transformation
represents a versatile, atom economical
entry to a great variety of benzoxepine skeletons equipped with functionalities
susceptible of further elaboration. Thus, for instance, the crude
adduct resulting from the annulation between 1d and the
allene 2j can be easily hydrogenated to the corresponding
saturated product 5 with excellent yield.

 1  Studies with deuterated substrates provided valuable mechanistic
insights. A competition experiment using 1d and its dideuterated
derivative (1d-d2, 98% deuterated)
allowed us to calculate a kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) of 2.3 (Scheme 4, eq 1), which suggest
the C−H bond cleavage has influence in the reaction rate. Interestingly,
treatment of (Z)-1d-d (90% deuterated)
with palladium acetate under standard conditions leads to a total
stereochemical scrambling of the deuterium in less than 30 min (eq
2). However, this isomerization does not occur in the case of the
methoxy derivative (Z)-6-d, even after
6 h (eq 3).9 These data are consistent
with the rapid formation of species like II, which can
easily reverse to the starting material. It was also informative to
observe that reaction with the optically active allene (S)-2a leads to a racemic product, which strongly suggests
the formation of an achiral π-allyl intermediate (eq 4).

Scheme 4 Mechanistic Experiments
A plausible catalytic cycle consistent with the above
data would
involve an initial ligand exchange between the phenol derivative 1 and the palladium acetate complex to give a species of type I, which can evolve by intramolecular attack of the conjugated
alkene to the palladium center to give an intermediate like II (or II′). This intermediate could then
undergo a base-induced rearomatization to form a six-membered palladacycle III (see Scheme 5). Albeit the current data fit with this hypothesis, a C–H
activation involving a concerted metalation-deprotonation cannot be
fully discarded.

Scheme 5 Plausible Reaction Mechanism
Next step consists of coordination of the allene followed
by a
regioselective migratory insertion to give a π-allylic palladacycle IV,10 which undergoes a reductive
elimination step to the benzoxepine products. The resulting Pd(0)
species is reoxidized to Pd(II) by copper diacetate and air. The selectivity
of the ring closing depends on the allene structure and electronic
characteristics of the substituents.

Although the above scheme
presents a feasible mechanistic scenario,
the reasons behind the different outcomes of the palladium and rhodium
catalyzed processes are intriguing. Therefore, we carried out density
functional calculations to compare the energetic profiles.11 As allenic substrate, we used vinylidenecyclohexane
(2e), which showed divergent reactivity with [Cp*RhCl2]2/Cu(OAc)2,6 or Pd(OAc)2/Cu(OAc)2 (Scheme 3). In consonance with the experimental results,
the activation barrier for the reductive elimination from IVPd is lower than that required for the β-hydrogen
elimination (Figure 1, paths black and gray). More importantly,
the energy cost for the reductive elimination is much lower than that
from a similar intermediate with the Cp*Rh complex (IVRh, black vs blue
path).11

Figure 1 Energetic profiles of
two pathways for Pd, and the reductive elimination
for Rh. For details, see the Supporting Information.11,12

The different energetic barriers for the reductive elimination
using rhodium and palladium catalysts can be readily explained by
comparing the structures of the π-allyl metal complexes IV and the corresponding TSs. The π-allyl-palladium
complex IVPd and TS1 present a very similar geometry, as can
be readily appreciated by comparing dihedral angles of the atoms shown
in green in Figure 2. However, in the case of rhodium, the conformation of the starting
π-allyl complex is substantially different from that of TS3. Therefore, going from IVRh to TS3 requires an important distortion (dihedral angle HCCC +94 in IVRh, and +152 in TS3, atoms in green, see Figure 2), which is energetically costly. Moreover,
and in contrast to what happens with Pd, in TS3 the rhodium loses part of the π-allylic coordination,
which might further contribute to destabilize the system, although
there is certain coordination to C4. Thus, the highest activation
barrier for the reductive elimination with the Cp*Rh complex seems
to be associated with the geometrical constrains of its pseudo-octahedral
geometry. In contrast, the square planar geometry of the palladium
fits very well with the structure required for the reductive elimination
process.13 This dichotomy associated with
the metal geometry might also explain other divergent outcomes of
reactions promoted by Rh(III) or Pd(II).5

elimination. Most hydrogens removed for clarity.

In summary, we have developed a straightforward and selective
access
to a wide range of benzoxepine skeletons through a palladium-catalyzed
(5 + 2) formal cycloaddition involving a C–H activation process.
This is one of the scarce examples of annulations based on the cleavage
of γ–C–H bonds which involve the use of allenes,
as well as one of the very few leading to seven-membered rings. Remarkably,
the method has a much higher scope with respect to both, the alkenyl
phenol component and the allene, than the rhodium-catalyzed annulations,6 and even allows the formation of cycles with
tetrasubstituted carbons. Computational studies support the hypothesis
that the different course of the reaction promoted by Pd(II) or by
Cp*Rh(III) catalysts can be ascribed to the geometric requirements
associated with their respective square planar or a pseudo-octahedral
geometries.
