A series of microstructured, supported
platinum (Pt) catalyst films
(supported on single-crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia) and an appropriate
Pt catalyst reference system (supported on single-crystal alumina)
were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition and ion-beam etching.
The thin films exhibit area-specific lengths of the three-phase boundary
(length of three-phase boundary between the Pt, support, and gas phase
divided by the superficial area of the sample) that vary over 4 orders
of magnitude from 4.5 × 102 to 4.9 × 106 m m–2, equivalent to structural length scales
of 0.2 μm to approximately 9000 μm. The catalyst films
have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy,
high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, and catalytic activity
tests employing the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction. When Pt is
supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia, the reaction rate clearly
depends upon the area-specific length of the three-phase boundary, l(tpb). A similar relationship is not observed when Pt is
supported on alumina. We suggest that the presence of the three-phase
boundary provides an extra channel of oxygen supply to the Pt through
diffusion in or on the yttria-stabilized zirconia support coupled
with surface diffusion across the Pt.

Introduction
In heterogeneous catalysis
the reaction mixture comes into contact
with the surface of a catalyst, which often consists of supported
particles of the active component dispersed and immobilized on a high-surface-area
carrier. These carriers are often oxides such as magnesia (MgO), silica
(SiO2), and alumina (Al2O3). The
active particles themselves may exhibit various facets as well as
defects such as edges and kinks, which may have different catalytic
roles. It is known that the interaction of the active component with
the support may have a profound effect on the activity and selectivity
of a catalyst.1a−1c A relationship between catalytic activity and the
presence of an oxide–metal interface was first suggested by
Schwab.2 Seminal work has, for instance,
shown that the role of an oxide support can be used to explain the
unusual catalytic behavior of gold nanoparticles deposited on supports
such as TiO2 and CeO2.3a−3c A number of
theoretical models have been proposed to describe the effect of an
oxide support on the catalytic activity of metallic catalysts.4 In general, the oxide support can interact with
the active phase through geometrical effects (e.g., strain due to
presence of support), electronic effects (e.g., charge transfer between
the metal and the oxide support),5a,6 or the creation
of special interfacial sites (where sites at the metal–support
interface are responsible for high activity),5a,7 or
even as a source or sink of intermediate species that may diffuse
over the catalyst.5b,8 The surface diffusion of intermediate
species, promoters, etc. can affect sites even micrometers away from
the interface.8b Therefore, from a structural
point of view heterogeneous catalysts represent a rather complex situation.

In order to gain atomic scale insights into a heterogeneously catalyzed
reaction system, one has to resort to model catalysts.9 The chosen model system must be carefully designed to adequately
probe the relevant aspects of the real reaction system.10 One should also take into account that real
reaction systems are typically operated at elevated pressures equal
to or greater than atmospheric pressure and can be chemically different
from model systems under idealized experimental conditions. Most model
metal catalysts are usually unsupported single crystals, and kinetic
experiments are usually performed at pressures much lower than atmospheric.
So far there have been very few reports on Pt-based supported model
catalyst systems with kinetics investigated at atmospheric pressure.
Contreras et al.11 demonstrated the importance
of the nature of the support using a series of arrays of Pt nanowires
supported on oxide films as model catalyst systems. Strong support
dependence was also reported for both reaction turnover frequency
and the activation energy for the CO oxidation reaction. Nevertheless,
the structural complexity of the model system used (i.e., polycrystalline
Pt and polycrystalline supports) and the fact that the catalysts used
were subject to structural changes during operation makes interpretation
of the results somewhat difficult.11 Johansson
et al.12 compared the activity of 750 nm
diameter Pt features supported upon both ceria (CeO2) and
silica (SiO2) (200 nm diameter features were also used
for Pt on CeO2 for comparison). There was a clear difference
in activity between the CeO2- and SiO2-supported
Pt systems. This finding was explained by the appearance of “an
extra channel of oxygen supply” for Pt in the case of a CeO2 support through oxygen surface diffusion from CeO2 to the Pt. However, the range of three-phase boundary (tpb) lengths
available for experiment was limited.

In an attempt to further
reduce the structural complexity of a
combination of Pt catalyst with an oxygen-delivering (ion-conducting)
support, we employ single-crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ,
8 mol %) and Al2O3 as support materials together
with geometrically well defined Pt films. YSZ exhibits high oxygen
ion conductivity but has poor electronic conductivity and is thus
relatively stable against chemical reduction in the bulk.13,14 Hence, we might expect YSZ to interact with the catalyst but without
the complexity associated with many other reducible support materials,
such as CeO2 and TiO2.15,16 In the case of an Al2O3 support, we expect
little contribution to the reaction from the Al2O3 surface (in the case of e.g. CO oxidation), and furthermore Al2O3 is not expected to modify the active Pt catalyst
to any great extent. The strategy of our experimental approach is
to investigate the role of the tpb between the support, the catalyst,
and the gas phase by preparing and employing a series of Pt films
with different geometries on otherwise identical substrates. Furthermore,
in order to be able to extract reliable kinetic data, we work below
the light-off temperature of the reaction. Hence, the design of the
model catalyst system and apparatus for kinetic measurements should
take into consideration heat and mass transfer effects so that light-off
can be avoided.

Oriented Pt films of high quality, being structurally
close to
single-crystal films, can be prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD).17 We employed PLD to fabricate dense and well-adhering
Pt films on both YSZ and Al2O3 single-crystal
surfaces: i.e. Pt(111)/YSZ(111) and Pt(111)/Al2O3(0001) samples with 9 mm × 9 mm area. These films, with full
surface coverage, were then further treated by a subtractive lithographic
technique. Partially dewetted Pt films were also produced by PLD to
obtain additional samples with different l(tpb) values
but without employing lithography. Using both approaches, we were
able to obtain structural length scales of Pt between 0.2 μm
and approximately 9000 μm corresponding to total lengths of
the tpb of between 4.5 × 102 and 4.9 × 106 m m–2, respectively. The influence of the
length and the nature of the tpb on the catalytic properties of the
patterned Pt(111) single-crystal catalysts for CO oxidation was then
studied as a function of temperature and partial pressures of O2 (p(O2)) and CO (p(CO)) at atmospheric pressure.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation and Characterization
Pt catalysts
on solid electrolyte YSZ and Al2O3 were produced
following the route described by Beck et al.17 In a first step the Pt films were deposited by PLD on YSZ (111)
single crystals (CrysTec, disks with a diameter of 20 mm) and Al2O3 (0001) single crystals (CrysTec, squares with
an edge length of 10 mm) using a KrF (λ 248 nm, ComPex LAMBDA
Physik Lasertechnik) excimer laser with a pulse energy of 300 mJ (Figure 1a,b). Argon was used
as background gas with a gas pressure of 1 Pa. A commercial Pt target
(99.95% Degussa) was placed at a distance of 45 mm from the substrate.
The deposition time, repetition rate, and substrate temperature controlled
the morphology of the Pt catalysts. The deposition time was 100 min
with a repetition rate of 10 Hz at a substrate temperature of 700
°C. In order to obtain a well-defined geometric surface area
of 9 mm × 9 mm, a Pt-coated stainless steel mask was placed on
the substrate prior to deposition. The thickness of the Pt films was
approximately 1 μm, as measured by profilometry. To stabilize
the morphology and to smoothen the surface of the Pt films, the samples
were heated in air, increasing the temperature from room temperature
to 750 °C at a heating rate of 1.7 °C min–1, and then holding the sample at 750 °C for 180 min.

Figure 1 Different steps
for structuring the YSZ- and Al2O3-supported
Pt films by a subtractive lithographic technique.
See text for description.

For patterning, the dense Pt films were further treated by
a subtractive
lithographic technique which consists of the following different steps.
A photoresist was deposited on the dense catalyst films by spin coating,
which was followed by a heat treatment (soft bake, 100 °C for
120 s) to increase the stability of the photoresist (Figure 1c). A chromium-coated photo
mask with the desired transferable structure was aligned on the sample;
the photoresist was exposed for 88 s (Figure 1d) and developed afterward for 60 s (Figure 1e). The resulting
resist pattern, which was identical with the photo mask pattern, was
transferred to the underlying Pt layer by an ion beam etching process
(Ar+ ions, Figure 1f,g). (The etch rate employed was determined from test samples,
for which energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to confirm
the removal of the Pt layer in the etched areas; results are not shown
here.) The final treatment was resist stripping by an organic solvent
for 120 min (Figure 1h).

High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) micrographs
were taken after the ablation process and after the resist removal
stage. After the ablation and sintering stage the Pt film showed a
smooth and dense surface, but the edges of the film had frayed irregular
contours (Figure S1a in the Supporting
Information). Nevertheless, after the removal of the resist the Pt
edges presented a sharp structure, although the Pt surface had been
roughened due to the etching and removal processes (Figure S1b,c).

Patterns were made using holes of diameter
4.9 ± 0.05 μm
in a square arrangement. Furthermore, one Al2O3-supported “patterned” sample was prepared in exactly
the same way but with no holes being formed. The numbers of holes
used in the pattern formation were 50 × 103, 200 ×
103, and 800 × 103 in the case of the YSZ-supported
Pt film. This corresponds to hole densities of 6.2 × 108, 2.5 × 109, and 9.9 × 109 m–2. The approximate Pt structural length scale of the
sample was simply estimated from the center-to-center separation of
nearest-neighbor holes. This results in structural length scales of
33, 18, and 9 μm, and these samples are referred to as 1PtYSZ,
4PtYSZ, and 16PtYSZ, respectively. The Pt tpb length can be estimated
from the number of holes. (It should be noted that the tpb length
we refer to here is the macroscopically observable tpb. The macroscopically
observable tpb is not necessarily the same as the microscopic tpb;
Ryll et al.18 have shown the importance
of grain boundaries, grooves, and voids in an electrode in the electrical
polarization of a Pt/YSZ system.) The total length of tpb and specific
length of tpb for these samples were 1, 4, and 16.2 m and 1.2 ×
104, 4.9 × 104, and 2 × 105 m m–2, respectively. Figure 2a–c shows HRSEMs of 1PtYSZ, 4PtYSZ,
and 16PtYSZ, respectively.

Figure 2 HRSEM images of samples: (a) 1PtYSZ; (b) 4PtYSZ;
(c) 16PtYSZ; (d)
400PtYSZ.

The number of holes used in the
pattern formation were 50 ×
103 in the case of the Al2O3-supported
Pt film. This corresponds to a hole density of 6.2 × 108 m–2. This results in a Pt structural length scale
of 33 μm. An additional Al2O3-supported
sample was prepared with no holes in the pattern. The Pt structural
length scale for this sample is approximated by the length of one
edge of the feature or 9000 μm. These samples are referred to
as 1PtAl2O3 and 0.04PtAl2O3, respectively. The total length of tpb and specific length of tpb
for these samples were 1 and 3.6 × 10–2 m and
1.2 × 104 and 4.5 × 102 m m–2, respectively.

Additionally, a second type of catalyst was
prepared on YSZ and
Al2O3 supports. By increasing the deposition
temperature and decreasing the amount of pulses during the PLD process,
partially dewetted Pt films with thicknesses between 50 and 130 nm
were obtained. For detailed deposition conditions the reader is referred
to ref (19). In the
case of dewetted samples the Pt tpb length was estimated using the
software Adobe Photoshop (version CS4 extended). The Pt structural
length scale is estimated by the ratio of surface area of the Pt film
to tpb length. This results in a Pt structural length scale of 0.2
μm, and the samples are referred to as 400PtYSZ and 400PtAl2O3 for the YSZ-supported and the Al2O3-supported samples, respectively. The total length of
tpb and specific length of tpb for these samples were 400 m and 4.9
× 106 m m–2, respectively. Figure 2d shows an HRSEM
of the 400PtYSZ sample.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to further
characterize
the surface of the Pt films as well as the walls and the base of the
holes in the film. AFM experiments were conducted with an Agilent
5500 AFM microscope in air. Images were obtained in contact mode using
nitrogen-doped silicon tips with a force constant of 0.02–0.77
N m–1. Typical scan rates were in the range of 0.5–1
kHz and 512 by 512 pixel resolution. Image processing was performed
using version 5.1.6 of the Scanning Probe Image Processor (SPIP) software
(Image Metrology, Lyngby, Denmark). The AFM topographic image (Figure S2a in the Supporting Information) show
a Pt wall exhibiting imperfections, unavoidable defects of the fabrication
process. Of particular interest are nanoscale features on the base
of the holes (Figure S2b), approximately
5 nm in height and tens of nanometers laterally. These features are
most likely irregularities on the YSZ surface due to ion beam bombardment
during the etching process.

All samples were characterized after
the preparation process and
before any experimental work by X-ray diffraction (XRD). All samples
showed exclusively the (111) orientation, in line with previous reports.17Figure S3 in the
Supporting Information shows the XRD pattern for the sample 16PtYSZ.
Similar XRD patterns were obtained for all YSZ- and Al2O3-supported samples. XRD shows narrow peaks (indicative
of highly crystalline material) characteristic of Pt. A low-intensity
peak and shoulder to the left of the Pt(111) reflection can be attributed
to trace amounts of material with argon implanted into the Pt(111)
plane. This is a common phenomenon associated with the sputtering
process.20

It is possible that there
could be contamination of the Pt surface
in the region of the three-phase boundary as a result of the ablation
process. Such contamination could be catalytically significant and
is difficult to characterize, as what constitutes a catalytically
significant level of contamination is unknown. However, one should
recall that for both YSZ-supported and Al2O3-supported Pt films a second fabrication method employing dewetting
was also applied. One might thus expect the level of contamination,
if present, to be different in such samples. These different fabrication
methods then allow comment to be passed on the likelihood of catalytically
significant contamination occurring during fabrication.

It is
worth mentioning that HRSEM micrographs and XRD data obtained
after the experiments indicated no morphological changes and no change
in the crystalline structure of the Pt film supported on either YSZ
or Al2O3.

Experimental Rig for Kinetic
Evaluation
A continuous-flow
single-chamber reactor with a total gas-phase volume of 30 cm3 was used for the catalytic experiments. The flow of gas to
the reactor was controlled by electronic mass flow controllers (MFCs).
All experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure. Flow rates
are given at normal temperature and pressure (NTP). The sample temperature
was measured by a K-type thermocouple placed in proximity to the Pt
catalyst surface. The use of a planar catalyst sample as opposed to
a porous catalyst should help avoid catalyst light-off, as the ratio
of area for reaction to effective area for gas–solid heat transfer
is close to unity (and relatively low). Furthermore, in order to ensure
that there cannot be a significant difference between the sample temperature
and the gas temperature as measured by the thermocouple, we limit
the kinetic data employed in our analysis to rates of reaction below
4 × 10–4 mol s–1 m2. (A value of 10 W m–2 K–1 for
the heat transfer coefficient between the sample and the gas phase,
a conservative value appropriate for natural convection or low gas
velocities,21 with a heat of reaction of
approximately 280 kJ mol–1 a rate of reaction of
4 × 10–4 mol s–1 m–2 results in a maximum temperature difference between the sample and
gas phase of 11 K). The gases used were 20% CO/He, 20% O2/He, and CP grade He (N5) provided by BOC Ltd. with typical flow
rates of 1 × 10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1). The flow rates were
also measured at the outlet using a Varian digital flow meter (1000
series). Helium was used as a balance gas throughout the experiments.
The carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the product stream
was analyzed using a XTREAM-CO2 analyzer provided by Rosemount.
The minimum detectable CO2 mole fraction for the XTREAM-CO2 analyzer was 1 ppm, which corresponds to a minimum measurable
rate of CO2 production of 1 × 10–10 mol s–1 with typical flow rate at 1 × 10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1).

Reaction rates (rCO2) in terms of CO2 production are calculated
as shown in eq 1: 1  where YCO2 is the measured CO2 mole fraction at the gas outlet, ṅ is the molar flow, and A is the
total Pt area. In order to be able to measure the rate of CO2 production under “gradientless” conditions, the reactor
was operated under conditions of differential conversion (5% conversion
of CO or less).

In this study we use the term “superficial”
area
to describe the area of the external facets of the dense Pt single-crystal
films and the term “pore” wall area to define the area
of the vertical walls inside the holes. The total Pt area is the sum
of the superficial area and the pore wall area. Table 2 shows the superficial area, the “pore”
wall area, the total Pt area, and the moles of Pt corresponding to
the total area for the samples used in this study.

b The area was calculated approximately
from HRSEM micrographs via Photoshop software. The TOF calculation
is based on this area.

The
kinetic behavior of the samples during CO oxidation was first
evaluated as a function of temperature. To study the effect of temperature,
the samples were heated in a gas mixture of 1.3 kPa of O2 and 0.5 kPa of CO from 150 °C up to 350 °C. The temperature
was held during heating after each step of 20 °C, the holding
time being varied between 60 and 180 min depending on the time the
reaction rate needed to become steady: i.e., the rate of CO2 production did not vary by more than ±5% over 60 min. The heating
rate between the isothermal periods was 10 °C min–1.

Second, the rate of CO2 production dependence
on p(CO) and p(O2) was
also examined.
In these experiments p(CO) was held constant and p(O2) was allowed to vary (O2 dependence)
or vice versa (CO dependence) at 288 °C. To study the influence
of oxygen p(CO) = 0.5 kPa was held constant and p(O2) was varied stepwise between 1.2 and 13.5
kPa for the samples 1PtYSZ, 4PtYSZ, 16PtYSZ, 1PtAl2O3, and 400PtAl2O3 and between 0.05 and
13.5 kPa for the sample 400PtYSZ with a varying step size of 0.05
kPa up to 4 kPa. In a second series of experiments p(O2) was held constant (0.64 kPa) and p(CO) was varied stepwise between 0.5 and 15 kPa with a varying step
size of 0.6 kPa up to 2.8 kPa.

Results and Discussion
Figure 3 shows the
rate of CO2 production (rCO2) as a function of temperature over two different Pt/Al2O3 samples, 0.04PtAl2O3 and
1PtAl2O3. The ratios of the “pore”
wall Pt area to the total Pt area for the two samples are different.
For the sample 0.04PtAl2O3 this ratio is 0,
i.e. there is no “pore” wall sites, while for the sample
1PtAl2O3 this ratio equals 9.4 × 10–3. It can be seen that the minimum temperature for
a measurable rate of CO2 production was around 310 °C
for both samples. Below 300 °C the rate of CO2 production
was below the minimum measurable limit (1 × 10–10 mol s–1). The activity of Al2O3-supported samples appears not to depend strongly on the number
of sites in the “pore” wall available, and we tentatively
conclude that these “pore” wall sites are not different
from the Pt (111) sites of the superficial area in kinetic terms (at
least in the presence of an inactive support). This is consistent
with the structure-insensitive nature of CO oxidation over Pt/Al2O322 below the ignition
regime. Henceforth we normalize the rates of CO2 production
on a surface area basis assuming “pore” wall sites and
superficial Pt (111) sites to be catalytically equivalent. The total
Pt area is thus used in the normalization of the production rates
of CO2 (rCO2) (eq 1). The rates of reaction
(CO2 production) are also expressed in terms of turnover
frequency (TOF), which is defined as the number of CO2 molecules
produced per active site per second. Since the number of active sites
is not strictly known, we estimate the total number of Pt surface
atoms, z, and assume that there is one active site
per surface Pt atom. Accordingly 2  where NA is Avogadro’s
constant. The product NAz–1 is the number of moles of Pt surface atoms.
The minimum measurable TOF value in our setup was 6 × 10–2 s–1. We note that the dominant
structural feature which differentiates the samples is the three-phase
boundary length.

gas flow rate: 1 × 10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1).

Figure 4 shows
the
natural logarithm of the TOF (ln(TOF/Hz)) versus the inverse temperature
(Arrhenius plot) for reaction over the four Pt/YSZ samples and two
Pt/Al2O3 samples (samples 1PtAl2O3 and 400PtAl2O3) and over the Pt/zirconia
(Pt/ZrO2) and Pt/Al2O3 samples used
by Contreras et al.11 (it was not possible
to extract rate data from the work of Ryll et al.).20 In the Arrhenius plot we mark the limit where the maximum
temperature difference between the sample and the gas phase is expected
to be 11 K. As Conteras et al.11 indicated,
their data points lie in the regime above the light-off point where
heat transfer limitations are expected. Some of the kinetic data from
our work lie in the same regime. For the YSZ-supported sample 400PtYSZ
it is clear that the activation energy decreases dramatically as the
temperature increases (from 250 ± 40 to 9 ± 1 kJ mol–1), indicating a transition to the light-off regime.
The kinetic data below the 11 K limit for the Al2O3-supported samples 1PtAl2O3 and 400PtAl2O3 do not allow for reliable determination of activation
energies. Apparent activation energies below the 11 K limit for the
YSZ-supported samples 1PtYSZ, 4PtYSZ, 16PtYSZ, and 400PtYSZ are 135,
90, 95, and 250 kJ mol–1, respectively (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). (One
must note that the statistical uncertainty associated with the determination
of a gradient from only three or four data points is significant.
This point is, however, largely overlooked in the literature.) The
apparent activation energies for the YSZ-supported samples are in
broad agreement with values reported in previous studies of unsupported
(35–137 kJ mol–1)23,25,29 and supported (30–125 kJ mol–1)26,27 Pt catalysts (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), with the exception
of 400PtYSZ (three data points).

Pt/Al2O3 samples (1PtAl2O3 and 400PtAl2O3) in a feed gas mixture of p(O2) = 1.3 kPa and p(CO) =
0.5 kPa. Total gas flow rate: 1 × 10–4 mol
s–1 (150 cm3 min–1).
Error bars indicate the uncertainty in ln TOF/Hz values. Data points
obtained from ref (11) over zirconia (ZrO2)- and Al2O3-supported samples are also shown.

In order to ensure that there cannot be a significant difference
between the sample temperature and the gas temperature, we limit the
kinetic data employed in our analysis to rates of reaction below 4
× 10–4 mol s–1 m–2: i.e., where the maximum temperature difference between the sample
and the gas phase is estimated to be not higher than 11 K.

CO
oxidation over Pt has been well studied with surface science
techniques. At lower temperatures the Pt surface is almost entirely
covered by strongly adsorbed CO. The rate of CO2 production
is determined by the desorption rate of CO, while oxygen can only
adsorb at sites where carbon monoxide has desorbed, leading to first-order
dependence on O2 partial pressure and negative-first-order
dependence on CO partial pressure. At higher temperatures the Pt surface
is covered by adsorbed oxygen. The rate of CO2 production
is limited by the oxygen inhibition of carbon monoxide adsorption,
leading to a first-order dependence in CO partial pressure and zero-order
dependence in O2.23−25 Numerous studies report TOF values
for Pt on different supports near or at atmospheric pressure. For
example, An et al.26 report TOF values
from 0.01 to 2.2 s–1 for Pt nanoparticles supported
on oxides (NiO, MnO2, Fe2O3, CeO2, SiO2) in a temperature range between 150 and
260 °C under reducing (p(O2)/p(CO) = 0.4) and oxidizing (p(O2)/p(CO) = 2.5) conditions at atmospheric pressure.
Similar TOFs for SiO2-supported Pt were found by Cant and
co-workers28 near atmospheric pressure
(0.01–0.1 s–1 in a temperature range of 150–240
°C, p(O2)/p(CO)
= 0.5). McClure et al.29 studied the activity
of Pt/SiO2 at higher temperatures (290–380 °C)
and found TOFs in the range of 20–300 s–1 for p(O2)/p(CO) between
0.5 and 2 at a lower total pressure (1 kPa). Haneda et al. and Allian
et al.22,30 reported TOFs between 0.3 and 2 s–1 for Al2O3-supported Pt in the temperature
range of 120–160 °C at p(O2)/p(CO) = 2 at atmospheric pressure.

TOF values
have been also measured for both supported and unsupported
Pt single crystals. Chen and co-workers31 reported TOFs of approximately 3 s–1 at 277 °C
(p(O2)/p(CO) = 22.5)
at a total pressure of 11 kPa over a Pt(111) single crystal. McRea
et al.32 reported TOF values of 20 s–1 at 350 °C for CO2 production over
unsupported Pt(557) single crystals at a total pressure of 102 kPa
for p(O2)/p(CO) = 2.5.
Higher TOFs have also been obtained for supported Pt single crystals.
Farkas et al.33 studied the CO oxidation
reaction over Pt(111) thin films supported on YSZ similar to the sample
with 400 m (4.9 × 106 m/m2) tpb length
used in our study. They reported a TOF value of 650 s–1 at 388 °C at p(O2)/p(CO) = 1.6.

Clearly the activity of the Pt catalyst is complex
and depends
upon operating temperature, pressure, and microstructure of the catalyst;
TOFs vary between 10–2 and 102 s–1. The TOF values for our work are similar orders of
magnitude (0.05–100 s–1) to those in the
literature.

Figure 5 shows the
dependence of the rate of CO2 production (rCO2) and TOF on p(O2) at fixed p(CO) over the four Pt/YSZ samples and
two Pt/Al2O3 samples (samples 1PtAl2O3 and 400PtAl2O3) at 288 °C.
For all samples the rate of CO2 production increases with
increasing p(O2). It is clear for YSZ-supported
samples that the smaller the structural length scale, the higher the
rate for a given p(O2). Note that the
Al2O3-supported samples exhibited much lower
reaction rates in comparison to the YSZ-supported samples.

Figure 5 Influence of p(O2) on the rate of CO2 production
(rCO2)
and the turnover frequency (TOF) over the four Pt/YSZ samples and
two Pt/Al2O3 samples (1PtAl2O3 and 400PtAl2O3) at a constant p(CO) = 0.5 kPa at 288 °C. Total gas flow rate: 1 ×
10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1).

Additionally, experiments at different p(CO) values
were performed over the four Pt/YSZ samples and two Pt/Al2O3 samples (samples 1PtAl2O3 and
400PtAl2O3) (Figure 6). p(O2) was
held constant, while p(CO) was increased. It is well
documented that strong adsorption of CO at this temperature will lead
to CO poisoning and a reaction rate of CO2 production that
will eventually decrease with increasing p(CO).34Figure 6 shows that the rate appears to decrease from p(CO) = 0.5 kPa to p(CO) = 1.0 kPa for all YSZ-supported
samples. However, for all but the YSZ-supported sample 400PtYSZ, an
increase in the reaction rate of CO2 production with increasing p(CO) is eventually attained (at high p(CO)). Thus, the YSZ-supported samples with a smaller Pt structural
length scale showed higher reaction rates of CO2 production
in comparison to the YSZ-supported samples with a larger Pt structural
length scale. It is noteworthy that the rate of CO2 production
for the Al2O3-supported samples is below the
minimum measurable limit (1 × 10–10 mol s–1).

Figure 6 Influence of p(CO) on the rate of CO2 production (rCO2)
and the
turnover frequency (TOF) over the four Pt/YSZ samples and two Pt/Al2O3 samples (1PtAl2O3 and
400PtAl2O3) at a constant p(O2) = 0.64 kPa at 288 °C. Total gas flow rate: 1
× 10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1).

Figure 7 shows
the
dependence of the rate of CO2 production (rCO2) versus l(tpb) at 250,
270, and 290 °C for the patterned Pt/YSZ samples (samples 1PtYSZ,
4PtYSZ, and 16PtYSZ). The temperature range was selected to be between
250 and 290 °C, because in this range kinetic data were obtained
for the rates of CO2 production for the three YSZ-supported
patterned samples below the limit where the expected maximum temperature
difference between the sample and the gas phase is 11 K. The Al2O3-supported samples do not show any measurable
activity in this temperature range. For the patterned YSZ-supported
samples an increasing l(tpb) (decreasing Pt length
scale) appears to be correlated with higher rates of CO2 production. It is possible that the Pt active sites close to or
at the tpb are modified due to the presence of the YSZ support. If
we consider that only the Pt/YSZ interfacial sites are responsible
for an increase in activity, then we would expect that the rates of
CO2 production would increase linearly with increasing l(tpb). This does appear to be broadly consistent with Figure 7. (We must also consider
the possibility that there is an extended region of high activity
close to the tpb as a result of contamination during fabrication.
However, the data presented here were obtained with two different
methods of sample fabrication (the higher tpb involving dewetting
and not ablation). We therefore suggest that contamination is not
the primary cause of the behavior.)

270, and 290 °C for the patterned Pt/YSZ samples (1PtYSZ, 4PtYSZ,
and 16PtYSZ). Total gas flow rate: 1 × 10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1). Error bars indicate the uncertainty in l(tpb)
and rCO2 values.

However, during the reaction an oxygen chemical
potential difference
will exist between the support and the Pt catalyst as a natural consequence
of the difference in CO oxidation activity of the YSZ or Al2O3 surface (low activity) and the Pt surface (high activity).
The residual electronic conductivity of YSZ may facilitate the transfer
of species from support to catalyst. Similar processes would not be
expected to occur when Pt is supported on Al2O3. Such species would be able to access active sites some distance
from the tpb through surface diffusion. If the structural length scale
of the Pt films is much greater than the diffusional length scale
of any diffusing intermediate species supplied from the support, we
would expect any modification of coverage to be confined to a region
close to the tpb; the diffusional length scale depends upon the ratio
of the surface diffusion coefficient of the diffusing species to the
equivalent first-order rate constant for consumption of the diffusing
species through the reaction. Hence, we would expect a linear correlation
between the rate of CO2 production and the increasing l(tpb). (If the diffusional length scale is greater than
the Pt length scales, then we would expect no correlation with the
Pt length scales, as the Pt film should remain uniform and free of
gradients in the coverage of any diffusing species.) Figure 8 shows the rate of CO2 production normalized by the length of the three-phase boundary
(rCO2′) versus the area-specific
length of the three-phase boundary (l(tpb)). The
tpb length normalized rate of CO2 production appears to
be a stronger function of the area-specific length of the three-phase
boundary at higher temperatures. This might be expected if the diffusional
length scale is of the same order of magnitude as the structural length
scale of the Pt films at these higher temperatures. Such comparable
length scales would mean that an increase in tpb length will now have
a diminished impact on rate, as diffusional processes are already
able to affect the whole of the structure. We tentatively suggest
therefore, in broad agreement with ref (8), that for the YSZ-supported samples the presence
of the three-phase boundary facilitates an additional channel of oxygen
supply to the Pt surface via a diffusional process which has a diffusional
length scale on the order of 10 μm or less.

samples (1PtYSZ, 4PtYSZ, and 16PtYSZ). Total gas flow rate: 1 ×
10–4 mol s–1 (150 cm3 min–1). Error bars indicate the uncertainty in l(tpb) and rCO2′
values.

Conclusion
In this study the influence
of the length and the nature of the
three-phase boundary (tpb) on the kinetics of patterned Pt (111) single-crystal
catalysts for CO oxidation was studied as a function of temperature
and p(O2) and p(CO) at
atmospheric pressure. A series of supported Pt catalysts (supported
on single-crystal YSZ or Al2O3 support) were
studied that exhibit area-specific lengths of the three-phase boundary
that vary over 4 orders of magnitude from 4.5 × 102 to 6.9 × 106 m m–2, equivalent
to structural length scales of 0.2 μm to approximately 9000
μm. If Pt is supported on an oxygen ion conductor, then the
rate of CO2 production has been shown to clearly depend
on the area-specific length of the three-phase boundary (l(tpb)). In particular, higher rates for CO2 production
can be achieved for greater lengths of tpb (l(tpb))
at lower temperatures and lower p(O2).
This finding is ascribed to the presence of the three-phase boundary,
which facilitates an additional channel of oxygen supply to the Pt
surface via a diffusional process. Quite in contrast, when Pt is supported
on Al2O3 the rate of CO2 production
is much lower than the rate of CO2 production over a Pt/YSZ
sample and does not depend strongly on l(tpb).
