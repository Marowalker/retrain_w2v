Introduction
Transition-metal-catalyzed
direct arylation is a well-established
method for the construction of biaryl bonds.1 The products of these reactions find widespread applications in
a variety of industries including pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and
material science.1 As such, there is a
continuous desire for the development of arylation methods with enhanced
scope, generality, and cost effectiveness. Considerations of atom-economy,
step-economy, and the environmental impacts of these methods are also
important.

The vast majority of currently known direct arylations
use aryl
halides (or their derivatives) as electrophiles.1 Recently, there has been an increasing interest toward
employing phenolic electrophiles in place of aryl halides in these
transformations to broaden the scope of C–H arylations.2 Furthermore, the use of phenolic electrophiles
avoids the production of undesirable halide-containing byproducts.3

In this context, a number of sulfonate
electrophiles including
triflates4 and tosylates5 have been successfully employed for direct arylation.6 In contrast, reports on the use of mesylates
as electrophiles are primarily limited to specific substrate classes:
perfluoroarenes,7a,7bN-oxides, (5d) and azoles.5b,7c Mesylates
are attractive electrophiles because they are more atom economical
than tosylates. Additionally, they are less expensive and more stable
than triflates.2a Despite these advantages,
the relatively few examples of direct arylations using mesylates can
be partially attributed to the poorer leaving ability of the mesylate
group.2a,8

Careful examination of the reported
methods (mentioned above) for
C–H arylations using mesylates reveals several avenues that
are either unexplored or underdeveloped. These include the following:
(1) the direct arylation of unactivated arenes, a reaction for which
no examples have been reported, (2) the coupling of azoles with electron-rich
mesylate electrophiles, a transformation which thus far provides arylation
products in only low yields,7c and (3)
a mesylation/arylation sequence that provides arylated products without
purification of the intermediate mesylates, a protocol which has not
yet been described.

We report herein the development of a palladium-catalyzed
method
for the direct arylation of arenes and heteroarenes using mesylates.
The experiments detailed below seek to address the limitations described
above. The synthetic scope and a preliminary mechanistic study for
both the inter- and intramolecular arylations are discussed.

Results
and Discussion
Preliminary Results
As part of our
program on the use
of C–O electrophiles for C–H arylation, we recently
reported the first example of palladium-catalyzed intramolecular arylation
of unactivated arenes with aryl mesylates.9 As a representative example, the Pd-catalyzed reaction of 1-OMs led to 1a in 79% isolated
yield (eq 1). Importantly, dcype (1,2-bis (dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane)
is the optimal ligand for this reaction. Other commonly employed ligands
for Pd-catalyzed C–H arylation of heteroaromatic substrates
with sulfonate electrophiles (e.g., XPhos,5d SPhos,7a CM-Phos7b,7c) did not afford the desired product. Although the products were
obtained in good yields using the Pd(OAc)2/dcype catalyst
system, only four examples of C–H/C–mesylate coupling
were reported by us in 2012 (eq 1 and Table 1, entries 1–3, vide infra).9 Notably, these examples were limited to the synthesis of
dibenzofurans. eq 1

Herein, we detail a more complete development of the
arylation
using mesylate electrophiles. Specifically, the current work (1) broadens
the scope of the intramolecular arylation of unactivated arenes, (2)
demonstrates the intermolecular coupling of azoles with electronically
diverse mesylates to obtain the arylated products in excellent yields,
(3) enhances the step-economy of the arylations through the achievement
of the sequential mesylation/arylation using phenols, and (4) provides
preliminary insight into the mechanism of the C–H activation
step.

Scope of Intramolecular Arylations
As shown in Table 1, the optimal conditions for Pd-catalyzed intramolecular
arylation of 1-OMs could be applied toward the cyclization
of a number of electronically differentiated aryloxy ether substrates.
Nitrogen-containing heterocyclic motifs including carbazoles and indoles
could also be accessed by this method in good to excellent yields
(Table 2).10 Importantly,
these heterocycles are widely prevalent in bioactive molecules.1

As illustrated in Tables 1 and 2, the reactions are
tolerant toward a number of
functional groups including ethers, benzylic C–H bonds, and
aryl halides. Notably, product 3a contains an aryl chloride
and could be further elaborated using cross-coupling reactions of
aryl chlorides (Table 1, entry 2). Substrates
containing electron-rich and electron-deficient groups on the C–H
bearing aromatic ring participate efficiently. The site-selectivity
for the reaction of substrates bearing two chemically distinct ortho C–H bonds is consistent with similar Pd-catalyzed
transformations reported previously.9,11 In these systems,
the product is obtained via the selective functionalization of the
less sterically hindered C–H bond (Table 1, entries 4–5; Table 2, entry 5).

Intermolecular Arylations
We next turned toward applying
our optimized reaction conditions toward intermolecular couplings.
We were particularly interested in exploring the efficiency for the
coupling of azoles with electron-rich mesylates because this reaction
class (e.g., using benzoxazole and 15-OMs, eq 2) has been reported previously to provide
only low yields of the arylated products.7c eq 2  

On the basis of the observation that
the electron-rich mesylate 4-OMs underwent intramolecular
arylation in high yield under our conditions (Table 1, entry 3), we hypothesized that our reaction protocol might
prove more effective for generation of 15a from 15-OMs. Gratifyingly, subjection of benzoxazole
and 15-OMs to our optimized Pd(OAc)2/dcype reaction conditions provided the biaryl product in
quantitative yield (Table 3, entry 1). Unlike
the intramolecular reactions of unactivated arenes discussed above,
the coupling of the activated heteroarene, benzoxazole, with 15-OMs could be accomplished with varying efficiency
using a number of phosphine ligands. Importantly, XPhos, SPhos, and
CMPhos are ligands that have been previously employed for the coupling
of mesylates with heteroaromatic C–H bonds.7 Nevertheless, the Pd(OAc)2/dcype catalyst system
still outperformed these other ligands for the formation of product 15a.

Similarly, high yields of the arylated products were obtained by
the reaction of other azoles with 15-OMs (Table 4, entries 5–7). The use of
other electron-rich mesylates such as 16-OMs, 17-OMs, and 18-OMs also led to the desired products in excellent yields (entries 2–4).

Sequential Mesylation/Arylation
Having explored both
inter- and intramolecular arylations with mesylates, we next desired
to develop a protocol for generating the biaryl products from phenols
without the necessity for isolation and purification of the intermediate
mesylates. These studies began with the investigation of the reaction
sequence depicted in eq 3 below. This two-step
method involved the mesylation of 15-OH with
mesic anhydride, followed by the subjection of the crude mesylate
solution to the Pd-catalyzed arylation conditions to afford the desired
product 15a, albeit in modest yield (52%). Importantly,
Cs2CO3 has been employed as the base in sequential
tosylation/arylation reactions previously.9 eq 3  

We hypothesized that the low yield
of this reaction could be in part due to incomplete conversion of
phenol 15-OH to mesylate 15-OMs in the first step. Indeed, analysis of the crude
reaction mixture after the first step showed the presence of both 15-OMs and 15-OH in
42% and 51% GC yields, respectively (Scheme 1). The use of alternative carbonate and phosphate bases also led
to low yields of the desired mesylate 15-OMs. This result was not too surprising because inorganic bases are
not standardly used for mesylation of alcohols with mesic anhydride.12 However, more commonly used pyridine bases are
good ligands for palladium and could interfere with catalysis in the
next step.13 As such, we hypothesized that
a sterically hindered pyridine-like 2,4,6-collidine could serve as
an effective base for the first step without significantly affecting
the subsequent coupling step. As shown in Scheme 1 below, the use of 2,4,6-collidine led to the desired mesylate 15-OMs in near quantitative yield as determined
by GC analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

Scheme 1 Base Optimization
for Mesylation Step
The newly developed two-step sequential mesylation/arylation
afforded 15a in quantitative GC yields (Scheme 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of such
a sequential mesylation/arylation sequence without isolation of the
mesylate intermediate. Notably, the use of mesic anhydride as the
mesylating reagent avoids the production of any halide waste. This
is an advance over previously reported sulfonation/arylation methods
that generally employ sulfonyl chlorides for the synthesis of the
electrophiles in the first step.4,5,7

Scheme 2 Optimized Sequential Mesylation/Arylation
The generality of the optimal conditions for the sequential
mesylation/arylation
sequence depicted in Scheme 2 above was next
explored (Table 5). A number of electron-rich
(entries 1–4), electron-neutral (entry 5), electron-deficient
(entry 6), and ortho-substituted phenols (entry 7)
efficiently coupled with benzoxazole to afford the products in excellent
yields. Substituted benzoxazoles, thiazole, and oxadiazole substrates
coupled with 15-OH to afford the arylated
products effectively (entries 9–12).

The sequential mesylation/arylation protocol was also
applied to
the synthesis of dibenzofurans from 2-phenoxyphenols. As shown in

comparable to those shown in Table 1 above.

Preliminary Mechanistic Considerations
Having explored
the synthetic scope of inter- and intramolecular arylations using
mesylates, we conducted preliminary studies to gain insight into the
mechanism of these reactions. On the basis of literature reports1,11a on Pd-catalyzed direct arylations, a plausible mechanism for the
transformations described here is shown in Scheme 3. It involves (i) oxidative addition of the C–OMs bond
into Pd(0), (ii) C–H activation, and (iii) reductive elimination
to afford the product and regenerate the Pd(0) catalyst. The C–H
activation step has been proposed to be turnover-limiting in similar
Pd-catalyzed direct arylations with aryl halides. Furthermore, C–H
activation is often thought to be a two-step process involving a π-complexation
event followed by C–H bond-breaking.11a,14

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism
We conducted kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies to gain
insight
into the nature of the C–H activation step. As shown below
in Scheme 4a, an intermolecular primary kH/kD of 2.3 was
obtained from the competition reaction of an equimolar amount of 26-OMs and 26-OMs-d5. Furthermore, the reaction of the monodeuterated substrate 1-OMs-d exhibited
an intramolecular kH/kD of 3.9 (Scheme 4b).14 Although initial rate kinetic studies are needed
to determine whether C–H cleavage is rate-determining, the
observed intermolecular 1° isotope effect suggests against π-complexation
as the product-determining step.15−17 Furthermore, the KIE
data are similar to previously reported direct arylations involving
a concerted-metalation-deprotonation (CMD) type mechanism for C–H
cleavage. The CMD pathway for C–H cleavage is proposed to involve
simultaneous C–Pd bond making and base-assisted C–H
bond breaking events in the transition state.11a,14,18

Scheme 4 Kinetic Isotope Effect Studies
We next turned toward gaining
insight into the electronic demands
of the C–H activation step. As such, we explored the arylation
of the amine substrate 27-OMs bearing two
electronically differentiated aryl rings that could undergo C–H
functionalization.19 As illustrated in
Scheme 5, the reaction of 27-OMs proceeded to afford a mixture of carbazoles 27a and 27b in a 3.9:1 ratio. The modest selectivity for
the arylation of the electron-rich aryl rings is similar to that observed
with Pd-catalyzed arylation using aryl halides11a and tosylates9 involving a CMD
electrophilic palladation step.14

Scheme 5 Electronic
Effects in the Intramolecular Arylation
Next, we sought to undertake a brief mechanistic exploration
of
the intermolecular reactions. Specifically, we explored the electronic
demands of both the C–H substrate and the mesylate electrophile.
As shown in Scheme 6, the reaction of an equimolar
amount of benzoxazole and 6-methoxy benzoxazole with 15-OMs led to a 1.2:1 mixture of 15a/15c. Such selectivity (albeit very modest in this case) for
preferential arylation of electron-deficient arenes has been observed
for the direct arylation of acidic arenes. However, the selectivity
for the reaction is significantly attenuated compared to selectivities
reported previously for related N-oxide arylations.20

Scheme 6 Azole Competition Study
Next, we explored relative rates of arylations
with electronically
varied mesylates. A series of competition studies were conducted involving
the treatment of benzoxazole with an equimolar amount of two electronically
differentiated mesylates in the same reaction vessel. As shown in
Scheme 7 below, in each case the major product
was derived from the reaction of benzoxazole with the electron-deficient
mesylate. These results are likely reflecting the electronic requirements
of the oxidative addition step because this step is expected to be
faster with electron-deficient aryl electrophiles.20−22 Although the
competition studies detailed herein provide some preliminary insight
into the electronic demands of these arylations, detailed kinetic
analysis is essential to elucidate the rate-determining step in these
intermolecular reactions.20−22

Scheme 7 Mesylate Competition
Study
In summary, this paper describes
the development of Pd-catalyzed
intra- and intermolecular arylations using mesylates. The intramolecular
reactions are applied toward the synthesis of heterocycles including
dibenzofurans, carbazoles, and indoles. The intermolecular arylations
are efficient for the coupling of azoles with electronically diverse
mesylates. Preliminary mechanistic studies are presented for both
the intra- and intermolecular arylations. However, more detailed kinetic
studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic intricacies of these
transformations.

To address a reviewer’s comment,
we
investigated the use of the NH analogue of substrate 8-OMs under the optimal arylation conditions. However,
very low conversion of the substrate and no carbazole formation was
observed by GC/MS analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

The kinetic isotope effect
studies for azole
arylations have thus far been inconclusive because of the following
base-mediated H/D scrambling. Furthermore, the H/D scrambling also
suggests that a mechanism involving (i) base-mediated reversible deprotonation
of the C–H bond, (ii) transmetalation of the azole anion onto
the oxidative addition adduct, and (iii) reductive elimination to
release the product and regenerate the catalyst, cannot be excluded
at this time.
