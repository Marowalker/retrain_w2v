Using colloidal iron
oxide nanoparticles with organic ligands,
anchored in a separate step from the supports, has been shown to be
beneficial to obtain homogeneously distributed metal particles with
a narrow size distribution. Literature indicates that promoting these
particles with sodium and sulfur creates an active Fischer–Tropsch
catalyst to produce olefins, while further adding an H-ZSM-5 zeolite
is an effective way to obtain aromatics. This research focused on
the promotion of iron oxide colloids with sodium and sulfur using
an inorganic ligand exchange followed by the attachment to H-ZSM-5
zeolite crystals. The catalyst referred to as FeP/Z, which consists
of iron particles with inorganic ligands attached to a H-ZSM-5 catalyst,
was compared to an unpromoted Fe/Z catalyst and an Fe/Z-P catalyst,
containing the colloidal nanoparticles with organic ligands, promoted
after attachment. A low CO conversion was observed on both FeP/Z and
Fe/Z-P, originating from an overpromotion effect for both catalysts.
However, when both promoted catalysts were washed (FeP/Z-W and Fe/Z–P-W)
to remove the excess of promoters, the activity was much higher. Fe/Z-P-W
simultaneously achieved low selectivity toward methane as part of
the promoters were still present after washing, whereas for FeP/Z-W
the majority of promoters was removed upon washing, which increased
the methane selectivity. Moreover, due to the addition of Na+S promoters,
the iron nanoparticles in the FeP/Z(-W) catalysts had grown considerably
during catalysis, while those in Fe/Z-P(-W) and Fe/Z(-W) remained
relatively stable. Lastly, as a large broadening of particle sizes
for the used FeP/Z-W was found, where particle sizes had both increased
and decreased, Ostwald ripening is suggested for particle growth accelerated
by the presence of the promoters.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Over
recent years, research has focused on the exploration of alternative
pathways to produce fuels and chemicals which are nowadays mainly
obtained from oil. As a suitable replacement for oil, synthesis gas
(a mixture of H2 and CO) can be used, as it can be derived
from natural gas, coal, CO2, renewable hydrogen gas, and
biomass1−5 and can be converted to a wide range of products via monofunctional6−8 and bifunctional catalysts.9−11

Recently, a bifunctional
catalyst system has been introduced by
the group of Prof. Bao consisting of a metal oxide and a zeolite (OX-ZEO)
to convert synthesis gas to short olefins via reactive oxygenate intermediates
such as methanol, dimethyl ether, or ketene.9,12−14 The choice of zeolite material is crucial to control
the resulting product spectrum of the OX-ZEO process. The reactive
oxygenate intermediates can be converted to olefins using zeolites
with small pore diameters such as SAPO-34 and SSZ-13. However, the
use of a ZSM-5 zeolite owning a larger pore diameter allowed the formation
of aromatics from these intermediates.10,15

Alternatively,
synthesis gas can be converted in the Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis (FTS) to ultraclean hydrocarbons in the range from methane
to waxes.6,16 Operating cobalt-based catalysts in the
low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch process (LT-FTS) results in
the formation of linear paraffins with high molecular weight, whereas
the high-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (HT-FTS) using
iron-based catalysts produces light olefins.6,11,17,18

The
product spectrum of the FTS usually follows the Anderson–Schulz–Flory
(ASF) distribution, a statistical distribution of products of surface
polymerization reactions. However, adding promoters to an iron-based
Fischer–Tropsch catalyst can lead to a deviation from the ASF
distribution in the so-called Fischer–Tropsch to olefins (FTO)
process.19−22 The presence of both sodium and sulfur promoters on the iron catalyst
is essential for a decreased selectivity to methane and increased
olefins/paraffin ratio.23−25 This allows the formation of
C2–C4 olefins with 65%C selectivity,26 more than the ASF-predicted distribution of
58%C selectivity for the C2–C4 fraction (olefins plus paraffins).27

These short olefins being formed on the FTO catalyst with high
selectivity can be further converted to aromatics on an H-ZSM-5 zeolite28−30 not only starting from syngas but also using CO2 as a
reactant.31 In this process, the Brønsted
acid sites (BAS) of the zeolite enable the aromatization of olefins
that are formed on the FTO catalyst. However, combining the zeolite
and FTO catalyst promoted with sodium and sulfur can facilitate the
migration of sodium ions from the FTO catalysts to the BAS of the
zeolite. This results in zeolite acid site neutralization and a loss
of the promotion effect of the FTO catalysts, thus increasing methane
selectivity.32

Metal catalysts are
typically prepared via methods such as incipient
wetness impregnation (IWI) or precipitation.33,34 These methods, however, can offer limited control over the metal
particle size, shape, and distribution, which is of the utmost importance
for catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.35−37 Therefore,
research in academia has focused on colloidal synthesis methods which
can controllably yield iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe-NP) of various
sizes. Here, an iron precursor is decomposed at higher temperatures
in a solvent in the presence of organic ligands, resulting in ligand
stabilized Fe-NP in suspension. Colloidal particles are subsequently
attached to different support materials, obtaining relatively sinter-resistant
catalysts.38−42

Furthermore, model catalysts composed of colloidal iron nanoparticles
supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) were used to study the FTO reaction.41,43 These colloidal particles were promoted with sodium and sulfur using
an inorganic ligand exchange method.44−46 Here, the organic ligands
stabilizing the Fe-NP are (partially) replaced with inorganic ligands
that can also act as promoters, such as Na2S.45,46 When applied in the FTO process, this exchange was performed after
the Fe-NP were attached to the support material.44 However, so far it has been challenging to direct the promoters
so that they specifically attach to the iron particles and not to
the support material.

Since the colloidal method has the advantage
of controlling the
particle size distribution, it means that it is easier to discern
particle growth mechanisms.24 Particle
growth can be divided into two distinctively different mechanisms,
namely Ostwald ripening, where the transport of mobile species happens
over the support or in the gas phase, growing larger particles at
the expense of smaller ones and coalescence and growth which involves
particle migration over the surface, coalescing to form larger particles.47

In this study, we prepared colloidal Fe-NP
and attached these in
a separate step onto an H-ZSM-5 zeolite to convert synthesis gas to
olefins and aromatics. This advanced synthesis method allows for uniform
particle distributions where the particles are located on the exterior
surfaces of the zeolite crystals. Using this method allows to create
a catalyst which not only uses the ZSM-5 as a support but additionally
to convert syngas into aromatics. To introduce sodium and sulfur promoters,
inorganic ligand exchange with Na2S was performed on the
Fe-NP either before or after attachment onto the zeolite. These materials
were used in the Fischer–Tropsch reaction to obtain olefins,
which are further converted to aromatics. We show the influence of
the synthesis sequence of Na+S promoted Fe-NP on H-ZSM-5 on the activity,
selectivity, and stability. Using ligand exchange prior to the attachment
(FeP/Z) compromised the catalyst stability when compared to ligand
exchange after attaching the particles (Fe/Z-P). A washing step was
used (FeP/Z-W and Fe/Z-P-W) to remove the excess of inorganic ligands
which led to a more active catalyst for both promoted catalysts. Finally,
analysis of the used catalyst revealed that particles from the promoted
FeP/Z-W catalyst partially shrunk to smaller sizes than the fresh
catalyst, giving a strong indication of the Ostwald ripening process.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
2.1.1 Synthesis of 6 nm Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
(Fe-NP)
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless
stated otherwise. To synthesize the colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles,
0.43 g oleic acid (90% purity), 0.21 g oleylamine (70% purity), 0.35
g 1,2-hexadecanediol (≥98% purity) and 10 mL 1-octadecene (90%
purity) were added to a three-neck round-bottom flask.43 The reactants were degassed under vacuum in
a Schlenk-line setup for 30 min 120 °C while magnetically stirring
at 650 rpm. The stirring bar used in the preparations were glass-covered
magnetic stirring bars to prevent contamination by iron uptake into
the PTFE of conventional stirring bars. The suspension was subsequently
purged with nitrogen gas, after which the temperature was lowered
to 90 °C and a solution of 0.21 g iron pentacarbonyl (99.99%)
in 1 mL 1-octadecene was injected. The temperature was then increased
to 290 °C in 10 min, and the mixture was refluxed for 1 h. Subsequently,
the obtained suspension of iron nanoparticles (Fe-NP) was cooled down
to room temperature and further processed in air. The iron Fe-NP suspension
was washed thrice, where the suspension was centrifuged in about 10
mL isopropanol at 2700 rpm for 15 min, and redispersed in five drops
of toluene. Finally, particles were suspended in 2.4 mL of toluene
by sonication for 5 min.

2.1.2 Attachment of Fe-NP onto
H-ZSM-5
As-synthesized Fe-NP suspended in toluene were diluted
with 10 mL
1-octadecene. 800 mg of powdered zeolite (H-ZSM-5, Zeolyst CBV 3024E,
Si/Al = 15 at/at, calcined for 5 h at 550 °C in static air) was
added to a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask, which was connected
to a Schlenk line through a reflux cooler.43 The suspended Fe-NP were added to H-ZSM-5 by pipetting while simultaneously
magnetically stirring at 400 rpm. The mixture was brought under vacuum
for 30 min at 120 °C to evaporate the toluene, and subsequently
purged with nitrogen. The temperature was increased to 200 °C
in 10 min under nitrogen flow and maintained for 30 min. Afterward,
the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and further processed
in air. Finally, the Fe-NP supported on the zeolite were washed five
times with a mixture of n-hexane and acetone (1:3
v/v) and dried at 60 °C for 1 h under static air, at 120 °C
for 3 h under static air, and at 80 °C for 3 h under vacuum.
This method allowed the synthesis of Fe-NP attached to H-ZSM-5
zeolite with 3 wt % iron loading. These samples are referred to as
Fe/Z.

2.1.3 Inorganic Ligand Exchange of Fe/Z
A 0.05 M sodium sulfide stock solution was obtained by sonicating
0.24 g sodium sulfide nonahydrate (≥98% purity) in 20 mL formamide
(≥99.5% purity) for 1 h. 2.2 mL of the stock solution was added
to 350 mg of Fe/Z and stirred at 400 rpm for 10 min.44 The promoted catalysts were first washed with ethanol,
followed by four times washing with a mixture of ethanol and acetone
(1:3 v/v), and finally washed with acetone. In every step, the supernatant
was carefully decanted and pipetted off. Finally, the catalyst was
dried at 60 °C for 1 h under static air, at 120 °C for 3
h under static air and at 80 °C for 3 h under vacuum. This promoted
catalyst is designated as Fe/Z-P.

2.1.4 Inorganic
Ligand Exchange of Fe-NP with
Na2S
For the direct promotion by inorganic ligand
exchange, a method was adapted from A. Nag et al.45 The as-synthesized Fe-NP suspended in toluene were added
to 2.4 mL of a 0.5 M Na2S·9H2O solution
in formamide. This formed two layers with the Fe-NP in toluene on
top and the formamide solution at the bottom. The solution was vigorously
stirred for 1 h. Afterward, the particles had transferred to the formamide
layer. The particles were washed with acetonitrile, centrifuged at
2700 rpm for 15 min and redispersed in five drops of methanol three
times. Finally, particles were suspended in 2.4 mL of methanol. These
particles are denoted as FeP-NP.

2.1.5 Attachment
of FeP-NP onto H-ZSM-5
FeP-NP suspended in methanol were
added to 800 mg of the zeolite
(H-ZSM-5, Zeolyst CBV 3024E, Si:Al = 15 at/at, calcined for 5 h at
550 °C in static air) in the Schlenk-line setup while stirring
at 400 rpm. Slowly, the vacuum was applied to the suspension and it
was heated to 50 °C to evaporate the methanol. The suspension
was kept at these conditions for 1 h to ensure the FeP-NP had attached
to the support. The catalyst was dried at 60 °C for 1 h under
static air, at 120 °C for 3 h under static air, and at 80 °C
for 3 h under vacuum. This catalyst is referred to as FeP/Z.

2.1.6 Washing Procedure
To remove the
excess of sodium and sulfur promoters from the Fe-NP and to recover
acidity of the zeolite by ion exchange, the catalysts (Fe/Z, Fe/Z-P,
and FeP/Z) were washed with an ammonium nitrate solution. 400 mg catalyst
was added to a 2 mL ammonium nitrate solution (1 mol/L in demineralized
water) and stirred at 400 rpm and 25 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the
catalysts were washed six times with a mixture of water and acetone
(1:3 v/v), centrifuged and dried at 60 °C for 16 h. Catalysts
will be referred to as Fe/Z-W, FeP/Z-W, and Fe/Z-P-W. After this procedure,
the H-ZSM-5 had been converted into an NH4-ZSM-5. However,
during the in situ reduction at elevated temperatures the ammonia
fully desorbed and the proton form of the zeolite was recovered, as
evidenced by TPD (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, SI). Moreover, the sample codes and descriptions of all catalysis have
been explained in Table S1.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
2.2.1 Inductively
Couple Plasma Atomic Emission
Spectrometry
The elemental composition of the catalysts was
determined with a Thermo Jarrell Ash model ICAP 61E trace analyzer
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES).

2.2.2 (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopy
To determine the size distribution and the spatial distribution
of iron nanoparticles on the support, before and after catalytic testing,
(scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) was used. Images
were recorded with an FEI Talos F200X transmission electron microscope,
operated at 200 kV in bright field (TEM) or dark field mode (STEM).
The samples were prepared on Formvar carbon film, 200 mesh copper
grids. The samples were dispersed in pure ethanol, sonicated, and
drop casted on the TEM grids.

2.2.3 Ar-Physisorption
Ar-physisorption
at −196 °C was carried out on a Micromeritics TriStar
3000 to determine the specific surface area and pore volume of the
parent zeolite. Prior to measurement, the material was dried in a
nitrogen flow at 300 °C for 16 h.

2.2.4 Temperature-Programmed
Ammonia Desorption
Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption
(NH3-TPD)
was done to determine the total amount of acid sites on all catalysts
with around 50 mg per sample. Drying was carried out with a heating
ramp of 10 °C/min until a temperature of 600 °C was reached
for 15 min. The samples were cooled down to 100 °C and ammonium
gas (10% NH3 in He) was dosed to the samples. Ammonium
desorption was performed by heating again to 600 °C with 10 °C/min.

2.2.5 Pyridine Infrared Spectroscopy
Pyridine
Infrared (IR) measurements were done as an addition to the
NH3-TPD. Around 20 mg of sample was pelletized into IR
pellets with a diameter of 1.3 cm. IR spectra were taken with a PerkinElmer
System 2000 instrument in the spectral range of 4000–400 cm–1 (32 spectra were acquired per sample). Background
spectra were recorded on an empty cell under vacuum (∼10–5 mbar). Drying of the pellet was done under the same
pressure with a heat ramp of 5 °C/min until a temperature of
350 °C was reached and held for 3 h. The samples were cooled
down to room temperature and pyridine gas was introduced (pPy ≈ 15 mbar) for 30 min. Thereafter,
desorption was performed at vacuum (∼10–5 mbar) by heating with a heat ramp of 5 °C/min until a temperature
of 150 °C was reached and held for 30 min. The pyridine was desorbed
by heating up to 150 °C while taking spectra every 25 °C.
When 150 °C was reached, the temperature was held for 30 min
and spectra were recorded every 10 min. Complete desorption of the
pyridine was achieved by heating to 550 °C (5 °C/min) and
maintaining that temperature for 2 h. The acid sites were calculated
following methods originating from both Emeis et al. and Hernández-Giménez,
A. et al.48−50

2.2.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Mass Spectrometry
(TGA-MS)
TGA was performed to analyze the organic ligands
present on the particles. The ligand content of samples ZSM-5 (support),
Fe/Z, and FeP/Z was measured using a PerkinElmer TGA8000, hyphenated
with a Hiden HPR-20 mass spectrometer. Catalysts were heated from
30 °C to 800 °C (5 °C/min) in 20% O2 in
Ar (16 mL/min). Additionally, ZSM-5 treated with the organic liquids
using the same procedure as that in section 2.1.2. (Attachment of Fe-NP onto H-ZSM-5) without suspended iron particles
present was measured. Lastly, Fe/Z was measured as well by using a
reduction procedure (5 °C/min to 350 °C for 2 h, 5% H2 in Ar, 25 mL/min) to find if the ligands were removed during
the in situ reduction in the FTO reaction. To verify the removal of
the ligands, the reduced Fe/Z was again measured by heating from 30
°C to 800 °C (5 °C/min) in 20% O2 in Ar
(16 mL/min).

2.3 Catalytic Performance
To examine
the catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts in the conversion
of synthesis gas to olefins and aromatics, experiments were performed
at 1 and 10 bar pressure.

2.3.1 Catalytic Performance
at 1 bar
The catalytic performance was investigated at 1
bar by loading 20
mg of Fe-NP supported on zeolite (sieve fraction of 75–150
μm) diluted with 150 mg silicon carbide (sieve fraction of 212–425
μm) into a quartz reactor. After in situ reduction at 350 °C
(5 °C/min) in a flow of 15 mL/min of hydrogen in nitrogen (2:1
v/v, resulting GHSV = 12 500 h–1) for 2 h,
a carburization step was performed at 290 °C (5 °C/min)
in a flow of 6 mL/min of synthesis gas (CO:H2 = 1 v/v,
resulting GHSV = 5000 h–1) for 1 h. The reaction
was carried out at 340 °C (5 °C/min) in a flow of 6 mL/min
of synthesis gas (CO:H2 = 1 v/v, resulting GHSV = 5000
h–1) for 16 h. The hydrocarbon products were analyzed
with an online-gas chromatograph (Varian 430-GC) equipped with a flame
ionization detector. CO conversion was calculated from the formation
of hydrocarbon from synthesis gas. Selectivities were calculated as
hydrocarbon distribution on carbon atom basis (CO2 free).
A CO2 selectivity of 40–45% is expected which is
around the thermodynamic limit under these conditions. In this specific
gas chromatograph, lower olefins and paraffins could not be separated.
Therefore, the C2–C4 selectivity will
always be shown as a combined number of both the olefins and the paraffins.
The activity was calculated as iron time yield (FTY) which is defined
as moles of CO being converted per gram of iron per second.

2.3.2 Catalytic Performance at 10 bar
The experiments performed
at 10 bar were carried out in a 16-channel
high throughput setup (Avantium Flowrence). Fifteen mg of the Fe-NP
supported on zeolite (sieve fraction of 75–150 μm) was
diluted with 100 mg silicon carbide (sieve fraction of 212–425
μm) and loaded into stainless steel reactors with 2.6 mm inner
diameter. After in situ reduction in a flow of 30% H2 in
He (v/v, resulting GHSV = 6900 h–1) at 350 °C
and 1 bar for 2 h, a carburization step was performed at 290 °C
(5 °C/min) and 1 bar for 1 h in a flow of 3.75 mLSTP/min synthesis gas (CO:H2:He = 6:12:1 v/v/v, resulting
GHSV = 4100 h–1). Reaction conditions were applied
by increasing the reactor temperature to 340 °C with 5 °C/min
and increasing the pressure to 10 bar in a flow of 3.75 mLSTP/min synthesis gas (CO:H2:He = 6:12:1 v/v/v, resulting
GHSV = 4100 h–1). The reaction products were analyzed
by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a flame
ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector. For the CO
conversion in the high-pressure experiments, the conversion toward
hydrocarbons and the formation of CO2 in the WGS was taken
into account. Selectivities were calculated as distribution within
hydrocarbon on carbon atom basis (CO2 free).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of the
Catalysts
Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe-NP) of 6 nm were synthesized
according
to a previously published method.41,43Figure 1A shows a transmission electron
micrograph of the colloidal particles synthesized with organic oleic
acid and oleylamine ligands. The organic ligands separated the iron
oxide particles by 2 nm when dried on the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) grid, which is associated with the length of one oleic acid
or oleylamine ligand.51,52 These Fe-NP were used in an inorganic
ligand exchange step to add Na + S promoters, following a procedure
mentioned in previous research45,46 (FeP-NP). Notably,
the particle size was unaffected after the inorganic ligand exchange,
as can be observed in the histograms but particles came in close proximity
to one another on the TEM grid (Figure 1B). The shortening of distance was assigned to stronger
particle–particle interactions originating from the charge
stabilizing ligands compared to the steric stabilizing organic ligands
in Fe-NP and the replacement of long oleic acid and oleylamine ligands
by small Na/S ligands.52

Figure 1 Electron micrographs
of the colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles
with organic ligands (A) and inorganic ligands (B) dried on a TEM
grid. The insets show the histogram of the size of the particles with
a number-average particle size of 6 nm.

The Fe-NP in toluene and the FeP-NP in methanol were attached to
an H-ZSM-5 zeolite producing Fe/Z and FeP/Z, respectively (Figure 2A,B) (Sample codes
and descriptions are summarized in Table S1). The micropore dimensions of H-ZSM-5 zeolites are 0.53 × 0.58
nm2,53 implying that the colloidal
particles of 6 nm could not enter the micropores, but attached to
the external surface of the zeolite crystals. The bare H-ZSM-5 material
had a micropore surface area of 365 m2/g and an external
surface area of 50 m2/g (obtained from T-plot) as obtained
from argon physisorption, see Figure S2 in the SI. As the external surface area
was relatively small, the particle to particle distances were small,
especially compared to colloidal particles with similar weight loading
on carbon nanotubes from previous literature,41,43 which had an external surface area of 230 m2/g. The particle
size of the Fe-NP was not significantly affected by the attachment
to the support, see insets in Figure 2. FeP/Z in Figure 2B displayed chains of particles probably because of
the small ligand sizes which enabled magnetic interactions of maghemite
or magnetite domains. The inorganic ligand exchange of Fe/Z to obtain
Fe/Z-P did not alter the particle size and distribution, as can be
seen in Figure 2C.

H-ZSM-5 with organic ligands, Fe/Z (A). Na+S ligand exchange performed
before attachment of Fe to the zeolite, FeP/Z (B) and Na+S ligand
exchanged after attaching, Fe/Z-P (C). Histograms of particle sizes
inserted in the top, right show the narrow Fe particle size distribution
and average particle size of 6 nm independent of the synthesis method.

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES)
was used to determine the weight loading of iron, sodium and sulfur
on the catalysts, see Table 1. The iron weight loading was close to 3 wt % in all samples,
however, the sodium and sulfur content varied per catalyst. As the
sulfur content was relatively low in the catalysts and close or below
to the detection limit of the apparatus, the ICP values for sulfur
should be considered only as indicative values.

a No size change was found when
attaching the Fe-NP to the zeolite support, or when washing and calcining
the catalysts. The weight loading was determined by ICP-AES and showed
all catalysts had similar iron weight loadings.

Acid Sites.

Previous research
gave an indication that for colloidal Fe-NP-based
catalysts an Na/Fe ratio of 0.09–0.12 at/at would be optimal
for a high CO conversion and high C2–C4 olefin selectivity.44,54 Considerably higher Na/Fe ratios
resulted in a decrease in activity by overpromotion of the catalyst.54 The sodium to iron ratio in this study was relatively
high (Na/Fe = 0.17–0.21 at/at) on both of the promoted catalysts,
most likely overpromoting both systems. In addition, there is a possibility
that the excess of sodium could be located on the Brønsted acid
(BAS) sites of the zeolite, blocking the acid sites and therefore
deactivating the zeolite.

3.2 Removal of Promoter Excess
To remove
the excess of promoters from the iron nanoparticles and zeolite, an
additional washing step using ion exchange was applied with ammonium
nitrate, creating the following catalysts: Fe/Z-W, FeP/Z-W and Fe/Z-P-W.
TEM images of the catalysts obtained through the washing step are
shown in Figure S3. No significant change
in particle size and hardly in iron content were observed from TEM
and ICP measurements (Table 1). ICP indicated that due to the washing step the sodium on
FeP/Z was almost entirely removed from the catalyst. In the Fe/Z-P
catalyst, however, some sodium was removed but most was retained,
and hence this catalyst was more comparable with active catalysts
from previous research.44,54

To get an indication
of whether sodium was specifically attached to the iron and/or to
the Brønsted acid sites (BAS), temperature-controlled desorption
NH3-TPD and pyridine IR were measured, see Figures S4–S9 in the SI. The NH3-TPD results could only be used as indicative
values as the ammonia did not specifically bind to only the acid sites
of the zeolite but also the iron (-oxide or -hydroxide) sites.55 Therefore, pyridine IR was used to obtain a
quantity for the BAS, see Figures S6–S9 in the SI. Using pyridine IR, a peak
indicating the BAS can be found at 1543 cm–1 while
the peak indicating the Lewis acid sites (LAS) are at 1455 cm–1. The peak at 1490 cm–1 originates
from BAS in the vicinity of LAS.50 To confirm
that the pyridine did not absorb on the iron particles, measurements
were performed on SiO2 and Fe-NP/SiO2, see Figures S6 and S7. No pyridine was absorbed by
the silica itself, as indicated by Figure S6. The Fe-NP did absorb pyridine as a peak was found at 1450 cm–1 to indicate LAS, see Figure S7. However, this pyridine was weakly bound to the iron particles and
desorbed before a temperature of 150 °C was reached (the temperature
used to calculate the number of BAS and LAS), confirming that this
absorbed pyridine was of no influence on the calculations done for
the acid site concentrations.

By integrating the BAS peak in Figure S8 it was found that the BAS in the H-ZSM-5
zeolite was 0.14 mmol/g.
From this number and the ICP values given in Table 1 (assuming that all sodium would have been
incorporated in the zeolite) the maximum amount of blocked acid sites
was calculated. It was established that if all sodium was located
on the zeolite a maximum of 79% of all the BAS on the zeolite could
be deactivated. However, when comparing the concentration of the BAS
in Figure S9, it was noticeable that all
the catalysts remained relatively similar to the parent zeolite implying
that the Na was mostly situated on the Fe-NP. Therefore, even though
sodium could have deactivated 79% of the BAS, pyridine IR showed that
acidity remained unchanged upon addition of promoters via ligand exchange,
which shows that the ligands have a strong affinity toward the iron
particles.

3.3 Synthesis Gas Conversion
To assess
the activity and selectivity toward methane, C2–C4 fraction and aromatics, the catalyst performance was observed
under Fischer–Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) conditions to convert
synthesis gas to olefins and aromatics (Figures 3 and 4). The activity
is shown as iron time yield (FTY), i.e., the number of moles of CO
converted per gram of iron per second. The promoted and unpromoted
catalysts showed low activity, as can be observed in Figure 3A, and low CO conversion as
observed in Table S2. To make sure this
was not due to any residual organic ligands blocking the active iron
sites, thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS)
was carried out, see Figure S10. It was
found that Fe/Z retained some of the ligands after the washing and
drying steps, but these were removed during the in situ reduction
done prior to catalysis. As discussed earlier, the promoted catalysts
were likely overpromoted and did not show activity due to the high
sodium content.44 An equally low CO conversion
was found in the washed Fe/Z-W catalyst (Figure 3B), clearly indicating that without promoters
no activity is found. However, when the promoted catalysts were washed
with the ammonium nitrate solution to remove the excess of promoters,
the activity was recovered, see Figure 3B. Interestingly, FeP/Z-W retained activity after washing,
although ICP indicated that sodium content was below Na/Fe = 0.03
at/at. Most probably small fractions of sodium, undetectable for ICP,
had not been removed and still acted as promoters for this catalyst.
After 4 h on stream, catalyst FeP/Z-W seemed to have reached equilibrium
and was stable up to 16 h on stream. Fe/Z-P-W however, showed activity
loss during the 16 h on stream, not reaching equilibrium within this
time. As all other catalysts had relatively low activity, it was difficult
to assess if these catalysts stayed stable, or merely inactive. It
is well-known that the active phase in Fischer–Tropsch catalysis
are iron carbides. From previous literature it is apparent that using
Na and S promote carbide formation and therefore activity during FT.
Thus, it was assumed that the promoters in all washed catalysts facilitated
the formation of iron carbides and hence a higher activity than Fe/Z-W.23,24,28,41

Figure 3 Iron
time yield (FTY; defined as moles of CO being converted per
gram of iron per second) at 1 bar and 340 °C with H2:CO ratios of 1 plotted as a function of time on stream for as-synthesized
catalysts (A) and washed catalysts (B). As can be observed in graph
(A), (un)promoted as-synthesized catalysts had a low activity due
to overpromotion compared to the washed catalysts (B). Adding promoters
and afterward removing excess Na led to active catalysts. All catalysts
were operated at CO conversions in the range of 3–5% conversion.

Figure 4 Catalyst selectivity of H-ZSM-5 supported iron catalysts
(FeP/Z-W
in green and Fe/Z-P-W in orange) under FTO conditions at 340 °C,
1 bar, H2/CO = 1 (v/v), GHSV: 4 200 h–1, TOS = 15 h. The methane selectivity of FeP/Z-W was high compared
to Fe/Z-P-W as, according to ICP, most of the promoted Na/S was removed
during the washing step. Both catalysts produced aromatics and Fe/Z-P-W
formed a relatively high amount of C2–C4 products.

The methane, aromatics, C2–C4 (olefins
and paraffins), and C5+-aliphatics selectivities were only
plotted for the FeP/Z-W and Fe/Z-P-W catalysts, as these showed CO
conversions to allow reliable measurement of selectivities, see Figure 4. The C2–C4 selectivities are given as a sum of paraffins
and olefins. A high olefins/paraffins ratio of ∼10 mol/mol
is expected for the washed catalysts, as at low pressures relatively
small amounts of olefins undergo secondary hydrogenation reactions.28 The methane selectivity gives an indication
of the presence of sodium and sulfur promoters on the iron particles,
as these promoters significantly decrease the methane selectivity.23 FeP/Z-W had a methane selectivity of 40%C, in agreement with the low Na/S content obtained from ICP
further indicating that most of the Na and S had been removed. Fe/Z-P-W
seemed to have retained the promoter effect, enough to lower the methane
selectivity to 15%C. This catalyst also obtained a relatively
high C2–C4 selectivity and a low selectivity
toward C5+-aliphatics. The selectivities toward C4-isomers and aromatics is shown in Table S2 which are similar for both active catalysts. Both washed catalysts
produced aromatics at 1 bar but as FeP/Z-W had a relatively low Na
content, it showed a high selectivity toward methane and a lower selectivity
toward olefins and aromatics. The methane selectivity is a good measure
for Na and S depletion from the iron phase,32 and hence it was tracked over time (Figure S11 in the SI) to infer if migration of sodium
or sulfur species to the ZSM-5 support occurred. At 1 bar pressure,
no change with time of the methane selectivity was found, indicating
no migration of sodium and sulfur species. The deactivation of FeP/Z-W
is limited but that of Fe/Z-P-W is extensive which can be explained
by the different particle–particle distances of the fresh catalysts
(Figure 2B,C). The
smaller interparticle distances of FeP/Z-W may facilitate sintering
most probably already during the reduction leading to lower activity
but higher stability whereas with Fe/Z-P-W the sintering during reduction
is limited leading to high initial activity but more particle growth
with concomitant deactivation during FT.

Additionally, the catalytic
performance was established for all
catalysts at medium pressure (10 bar) and reported in Table S3. The CO conversions of the washed catalysts
were similar (between 10 and 15%). The activity increase after washing
the catalysts was also seen at medium pressure. Furthermore, Fischer–Tropsch
at medium pressure led to a significant increase in methane formation
and a concomitant decrease of aromatics selectivity pointing to a
higher hydrogenation activity.28 The FT
activity of the promoted catalysts was similar to promoted colloidal
particles supported on carbon nanotubes as reported in literature.44

3.4 Analysis of the Used Catalysts
The
used catalysts of the 1 and 10 bar experiment were analyzed using
TEM (Figures 5 and S12 and Table S3 in
the SI). At 1 bar, notably, particles were
remarkably stable in the unpromoted catalyst (Figure 5A,D), especially considering the initial
small particle–particle distances. Growth was observed in the
promoted catalysts, particularly FeP/Z, in line with previous studies
showing that if Na and S are present, this accelerates particle growth.24 A combination of factors could have caused this
growth, namely a large number of promoters and altered particle-support
interaction as well as a less homogeneous distribution of particles
in the fresh catalyst due to the short ligands. This resulted in particle
growth to at least twice the initial diameter, as can be observed
in Figure 5B. Scanning-transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) images were made for this catalyst to better
observe the contrast between the large iron particles and the zeolite.
Moreover, when applying high-pressure conditions, the growth of FeP/Z
became even more evident (Figure S12E).

Figure 5 TEM images
of all 1 bar used catalysts. (A–C) Fe/Z (A),
FeP/Z (B), and Fe/Z-P (C). (D–F) Fe/Z (D), FeP/Z (E), and Fe/Z-P
(F). The unpromoted catalysts (Fe/Z and Fe/Z-W) showed little particle
growth. Catalysts that had been promoted after attachment (Fe/Z-P
and Fe/Z-P-W) showed particle growth up to 20 nm. Spent FeP/Z and
FeP/Z-W catalysts showed next to larger particles also smaller particles
(see arrows) compared to the fresh catalyst with a distribution that
is skewed to larger sizes, as can be seen from the inset histograms.
A large fraction of the original 6 nm particles had shrunk to <5
nm particles or grown to particles >10 nm.

At 10 bar, Fe/Z-P (Figure S12C) grew
into a bimodal size distribution at showing that the promoters have
a large influence on the catalyst stability, which is in agreement
with previous work on carbon nanofibers.24 In this previous research on colloidal particles attached to carbon
performed at 10 bar, a bimodal particle size distribution was seen
as well. The increased growth rate was therefore attributed to the
higher pressure used in catalysis.44 This
is supported by Figure S1, where 10 bar
catalysis did yield particle sizes comparable with the previously
discussed colloidal particles on carbon.

Furthermore, in Figures 5E and S13 it is observed that the
particle size distribution in FeP/Z-W ranged from particles smaller
than the fresh catalyst’s size (<5 nm) to larger (>10
nm)
particles. This strongly indicates that the growth mechanism is dominated
by the Ostwald ripening process.56 In previous
studies, DFT calculations found that elevated temperatures and the
presence of CO can induce subcarbonyl species with high mobility,
making Fischer–Tropsch catalysts prone to Ostwald ripening.57−59 To our knowledge, no similar results have been reported with evidence
of particle shrinking after catalysis for iron FT catalysis. These
data indicate that sintering of the colloidal particles goes through
the Ostwald ripening process where Fe subcarbonyls most likely play
an important role. Furthermore, as pointed out in previous research,
sulfur might accelerate the production of iron pentacarbonyl species
which indicates that the S promoters enhance the growth rather than
suppress it.60

4 Conclusions
In summary, using colloidal particles attached to an H-ZSM-5 support
resulted in a uniform metal particle distribution on the external
surfaces of the zeolite crystals (Fe/Z) even if these particles were
promoted afterward with Na and S (Fe/Z-P), while at the same time
displaying a narrow particle size distribution when organic ligands
were used. When inorganic ligands were present before attaching the
particles to the zeolite surface (FeP/Z), particles were less uniformly
distributed due to their small ligand sizes but still showed a narrow
particle size distribution. The large amount of Na and S in both Fe/Z-P
and FeP/Z resulted in low catalyst activity, as both catalysts were
overpromoted. The promoter amount was lowered with an additional washing
step using ammonium nitrate enhancing the activity for both catalysts.
However, washing the FeP/Z catalyst caused the amount of promoters
to drop below the detection limit of ICP, thus loosing promotion effect
and therefore obtaining a high methane selectivity. After washing
Fe/Z-P showed a low selectivity toward methane and the formation of
aromatics. Pyridine IR showed that the zeolite retained acidity using
the colloidal ligand exchange method even though the zeolite was in
direct contact with the promoter solution. Clearly, this ligand exchange
is a promising method to obtain active and selective iron on zeolite
catalysts, because it enables the steering of promoters to the iron
particles instead of on the zeolite acid sites.

Additionally,
it was confirmed again that adding Na and S promoters
accelerated particle growth during catalysis. During the analysis
of the FeP/Z-W used catalyst, it was found that the particle size
had both increased and decreased, suggesting an Ostwald ripening process
accelerated by the added promoters. Therefore, this research additionally
shows that due to the advantageous narrow particle size distribution,
colloids can be used to investigate particle growth and that using
ligand exchange directs the promoters specifically toward the iron
particles instead of reducing zeolite acidity.
