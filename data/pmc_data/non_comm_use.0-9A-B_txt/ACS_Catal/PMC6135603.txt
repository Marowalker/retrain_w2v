Modifying Pt catalysts
using hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) has
been demonstrated to be a facile approach for boosting the performance
of Pt catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This work
aims to deepen the understanding and initiate a rational molecular
tuning of ILs for improved activity and stability. To this end, Pt/C
catalysts were modified using a variety of 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([CnC1im][NTf2], n = 2–10)
ILs with varying alkyl chain lengths in imidazolium cations, and the
electrocatalytic properties (e.g., electrochemically active surface
area, catalytic activity, and stability) of the resultant catalysts
were systematically investigated. We found that ILs with long cationic
chains (C6, C10) efficiently suppressed the formation of nonreactive
oxygenated species on Pt; however, at the same time they blocked active
Pt sites and led to a lower electrochemically active surface area.
It is also disclosed that the catalytic activity strongly correlates
with the alkyl chain length of cations, and a distinct dependence
of intrinsic activity on the alkyl chain length was identified, with
the maximum activity obtained on Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2]. The optimum arises from the counterbalance between more
efficient suppression of oxygenated species formation on Pt surfaces
and more severe passivation of Pt surfaces with elongation of the
alkyl chain length in imidazolium cations. Moreover, the presence
of an IL can also improve the electrochemical stability of Pt catalysts
by suppressing the Pt dissolution, as revealed by combined identical-location
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses.

1 Introduction
Low-temperature fuel cells (LTFCs) featuring high efficiency and
low emission to the environment are expected to play an important
role in the clean energy scenario of the future.1−3 However, the
slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode
poses major barriers to broad-based applications of LTFC technology,
particularly in the automotive industry.4,5 Although carbon-supported
Pt nanoparticles set the benchmark for the most efficient ORR catalysts,
an undesirable overpotential (300–400 mV) is still needed to
accelerate the ORR process to proceed at a significant rate.6−8 Researchers have struggled for decades to improve the catalytic
performance of cathode catalysts toward the ORR, either by engineering
the structure of Pt catalysts through tuning their particle shapes,
sizes, and/or surface compositions or by developing alternative non-precious-metal
catalysts (NPMCs), which mainly include transition-metal oxides9−11 and carbon-based materials (e.g., pyrolyzed Fe-N-C, metal-free functionalized
carbons, heteroatom-doped carbons, and metal–organic framework
(MOF)/zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived carbon).12−15 Despite the great achievement in developing highly active NPMCs
whose activity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the state
of the art Pt catalysts, the stability performance of NPMCs under
real fuel cell operation conditions (e.g., 0.6 V) or after frequent
cathode potential excursions to >1.5 V (i.e., mimicking the start-up/shutdown
operations) is still far from satisfactory or comparable to that of
Pt catalysts, which has prohibited NPMCs from penetrating the commercial
market in the short term.16 So far, combining
Pt with base metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn) still represents the
most successful attempt in the search for high-performing ORR catalysts,17−27 as showcased by the record high specific activity of Pt3Ni(111)28 and practical applications of
PtCo catalysts in recently developed fuel cell electric vehicles.29

In addition to direct engineering of the
structure of active sites,
introduction of a subtle amount of hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs)
into Pt-based catalysts which follows the so-called “solid
catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL)” concept30 has also been demonstrated in recent years to
be an effective approach to improving Pt activity toward the ORR.31−36 The pioneering work was conducted by Erlebacher et al., who found
that the specific activity of IL ([MTBD][beti])-modified porous PtNi
films or nanoparticles toward the ORR was enhanced by 2–3 times
relative to that of their pristine counterparts.31,33 The enhanced activity was mainly attributed to the high O2 solubility in the IL phase.31,33 Similarly, Zheng et
al. reported that IL ([MTBD][NTf2])-impregnated graphene-supported
Pt nanoparticles exhibited 2 times higher ORR activity and improved
methanol tolerance in comparison to its counterpart without IL.32 We also studied in detail the boosting effect
of an IL ([MTBD][NTf2]) on the ORR over Pt/C catalysts,
by varying the filling degrees (α) of the IL within the pores
of Pt/C catalysts. It was disclosed that both the catalytic activity
and stability showed dependence on the α value, and the maximum
activity was obtained at α = 50%, as a result of the tradeoff
between the activity-boosting effect and the enhanced mass transfer
resistance in the presence of the IL.35 More recently, we discovered that modifying a Pt/C catalyst with
a conventional and inexpensive IL, i.e., [C4C1im][NTf2], can also bring about remarkable enhancement
in the catalytic activity of Pt/C toward the ORR. It is disclosed
that the presence of IL can boost the overall reaction rate of the
ORR by suppressing the formation of nonreactive species (identified
mainly as OHad) on Pt sites.36 The successful application of the SCILL concept in boosting ORR
catalysts was also reflected by some more recent studies, where the
catalytic activity of both conventional Pt-based catalysts and emerging
non-precious-metal catalysts such as Fe-N-C and N-doped graphene was
found to be enhanced after IL modifications.37−41 All of these inspiring works imply that the IL modification
has the potential to become a generic method to improve the catalytic
performance of cathodic ORR catalysts, while a fundamental understanding
of the boosting effect from IL modification at a molecular level is
still needed.

Intrigued by the great structural flexibility
of imidazolium-based
ILs,42,43 in the current study we synthesized a series
of IL-modified Pt/C catalysts using imidazolium-based ILs with varied
cationic alkyl chain lengths ranging from C2 to C10. The structures
of these ILs are illustrated in Figure 1. We systematically explore the electrocatalytic and
structural properties of these IL-modified Pt/C catalysts, in the
hope of gaining some new insight into complex interactions of IL with
solid catalysts and the promoting role of IL toward ORR over a Pt/C
catalyst. It turns out that both the electrochemically active surface
area (ECAS) and catalytic properties of Pt toward the ORR can be readily
manipulated by varying the side chain lengths of the imidazolium ions.
A distinct dependence of catalytic activity of Pt toward ORR on the
side chain length is identified, and the maximum activity is obtained
using an IL with a medium chain length (C4), which originates from
the counterbalance between more efficiently suppressed formation of
nonreactive oxygenated species on Pt and more severe passivation of
Pt surfaces with elongation of the cationic chain length. Identical-location
TEM and in situ ICP-MS analyses were conducted on the pristine and
IL-modified Pt/C samples, and we found that the presence of ILs can
effectively suppress the Pt dissolution which is thought to be the
major cause for the degradation of the pristine Pt/C catalyst. We
believe that these new findings will enrich our knowledge of the SCILL
concept and provide some guidelines for designing efficient SCILL
systems for other electrocatalytic and/or heterogeneous catalytic
applications.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Pt/C catalyst (20 wt %,
HiSPEC-3000, Johnson Matthey) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. HClO4 solution (70%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluomethanesulfonyl)imide ([C2C1im][NTf2]) and lithium bis(trifluomethanesulfonyl)imide
(NTf2) (99%) were purchased from IoLiTec GmbH. 1-Bromobutane
(≥98%) and 1-bromodecane (≥98%) were obtained from Merck.
1-Bromohexane (≥99%) and 1-bromooctane (≥99%) were provided
by Acros Organics. 1-Methylimidazole (99%) was supplied by Solvent
Innovation GmbH. All chemicals were used as received without further
purification.

2.2 Synthesis
2.2.1 Synthesis of Ionic Liquids
The
imidazolium-based ILs reported in this work were synthesized from
1-methylimidazole, 1-bromobutane, 1-bromohexane, 1-bromodecane, and
lithium bis(trifluomethanesulfonyl)imide salt according to a literature
protocol,44 and the detailed synthetic
procedure for each IL can be found in the Supporting Information. The ILs were obtained as pale yellow or colorless
liquids and were characterized by NMR spectroscopy (Figure S1), where peaks marked with X are attributed to the
presence of water traces in the DMSO solvent used for analyses.

2.2.2 Synthesis of IL-Modified Pt/C Samples
The IL-modified Pt/C samples were synthesized by impregnating commercial
Pt/C catalysts with the as-prepared ILs according to our previously
developed protocol.35 A typical procedure
is as follows: 90 mg of Pt/C catalyst was first mixed with 10 mL of
isopropyl alcohol solution containing a calibrated amount of IL (corresponding
to a final pore filling degree of 10%) with intense stirring at room
temperature. After a 20 min ultrasonic treatment of this mixture,
the isopropyl alcohol was slowly removed from the slurry by rotary
evaporation under low-vacuum conditions (137 mbar, 60 °C), followed
by further evaporation at 8 mbar vacuum to facilitate complete intrusion
of IL into pores. Finally, the sample was dried under high-vacuum
conditions (2 × 10–3 mbar, room temperature)
overnight in order to ensure complete removal of the solvent.

2.3 Instrumentation
1H NMR
spectra of the ILs were recorded using an NMR tube filled with DMSO-d6 on an ECX 400 spectrometer (JEOL). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured using a JEOL JEM-2100F
microscope operated at 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by placing
a drop of catalyst powder dispersion in deionized water onto a carbon-film-coated
Cu grid, followed by drying under ambient conditions. Identical location
TEM characterizations were carried out by using carbon-coated Au finder
grids (G200F1, Quantifoil). More details about identical location
TEM measurements can be found in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The loading amounts of Pt on SCILL
samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectrometry (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer Plasma 400). Electrochemical Pt
dissolution tests were carried out on an in situ scanning flow cell
coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SFC-ICP-MS)
(NexION 300X, PerkinElmer) as described in previous works.45,46 The measurement procedures are detailed in the Supporting Information.

2.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
Electrochemistry
measurements were conducted on a PARSTAT 4000 Potentiostat/Galvanostat
(AMETEK). A double-junction Ag/AgCl electrode (Sigma-Aldrich) and
a platinum coil (PINE) isolated by a fritted glass tube were used
as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A glassy-carbon
rotating disk electrode (RDE, 5 mm, PINE) was used as the working
electrode. All potentials reported here were calibrated against the
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). To determine the electron transfer
number of ORR on different samples, the rotating ring disk electrode
(RRDE) technique was employed. The RRDE working electrode is made
of a glassy-carbon-disk electrode and a Pt-ring electrode with a collection
efficiency of 37% (PINE). During the RRDE measurements, two potentiostats
(PMC-1000, AMETEK) were used to control the potentials of disk and
ring electrodes independently, and the potential of the Pt ring electrode
was set to 1.4 V. Prior to each experiment, the RDE was polished to
a mirror finish using an alumina suspension (0.05 μm, BUEHLER),
followed by cleaning ultrasonically with ethanol, acetone, and then
deionized water, respectively. Catalyst ink solutions were prepared
by sonicating a suspension of catalyst powder (5 mg) in a mixture
of deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and 5 wt % Nafion solution
in a volume ratio of 4:1:0.025. A calibrated amount of catalyst ink
was then applied onto the RDE and dried under a gentle argon flow
in order to form a uniform catalyst layer. The Pt loading was controlled
at 20.4 μg cm–2 on the glassy-carbon electrode.

All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a N2- or O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The
catalyst-coated working electrode was first pretreated by using a
cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in the potential range of 0–1.3
V (versus RHE) for 20 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. In order to determine the ECAS values of different electrocatalysts,
CV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1, and ECAS values were then evaluated by integrating the H adsorption
signals on the CV curves, assuming 210 μC cm–2 for calibrating the charge of a H monolayer per unit Pt surface
area.47,48 Before ORR measurements, the electrolyte
was first saturated with O2 by bubbling high-purity O2 into the HClO4 solution for at least 30 min, and
an O2 flow was then maintained to avoid any disturbance
from the ambient atmosphere during measurements. The ORR tests were
carried out with a rotating RDE at a rate of 1600 rpm, and polarization
curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. The ohmic drop effect was compensated for all the ORR measurements.
The ohmic resistance was determined by conducting electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis with an ac signal amplitude
of 5 mV.

For CO-stripping measurements, the catalysts were first
saturated
with CO by bubbling high-purity CO through the electrolyte at open
circuit potential for 15 min. The electrolyte was then purged with
N2 for another 15 min before the stripping measurement.
The CO-stripping curves were recorded at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. In order to better distinguish the CO-stripping
signals, the as-measured CO-stripping curves were corrected by subtracting
background currents associated with the double-layer charging and
surface oxidation, which were recorded in the subsequent anodic-scan
voltammograms. The ECASCO value was evaluated from the
charge corresponding to the CO-stripping signal after background subtraction,
assuming a specific charge of 420 μC cm–2 for
a monolayer of CO. To distinguish the individual contributions of
prepeak and main peak to ECASCO, the integration was also
made by splitting the CO-stripping signal at the valley between two
peaks (∼0.68 V) for the pristine Pt/C catalyst.

3 Results
3.1 Structural Analysis
The ILs investigated
in this work were synthesized through a metathesis reaction of halide
salts of the imidazolium ions with varied alkyl chain lengths and
Li[NTf2]. The successful formation and purity of the as-synthesized
ILs were verified by using 1H NMR (Figure S1), where the characteristic proton chemical shift
peaks can be clearly observed. To explore the possible structural
change of Pt/C samples after IL modification, we conducted TEM analyses
on the pristine Pt/C and the Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2]. As displayed in Figure 2, for both samples Pt nanoparticles are well dispersed
on carbon supports without any severe particle aggregation. The statistical
analyses based on over 200 randomly selected Pt nanoparticles also
confirm that there is negligible change in average particle size/distribution
before and after the IL modification.

(a) and the IL ([C4C1im][NTf2]) modified

in different images to determine the average particle sizes and their
distribution.

3.2 Electrochemical
Measurements
The
electrochemical properties of the pristine and IL-modified Pt/C samples
were first probed using CV techniques, and their corresponding CV
curves are shown in Figure 3a. The characteristic signals featuring hydrogen adsorption/desorption
on Pt can be seen for all the samples in the potential range of 0.05–0.40
V, along with the oxidation signals beyond 0.6 V corresponding to
formation of surface oxygenated species on Pt surfaces.47,49,50 The ECAS values of the pristine
and IL-modified Pt/C samples derived from the hydrogen adsorption
signals (HUPD) are summarized in Figure 3b. The samples prepared
by using ILs with relatively short alkyl chains (n < 6) possess ECAS values (96.0, 94.6, and 94.0 m2 gPt–1) quite comparable to that of the pristine
Pt/C (99.0 m2 gPt–1), while
further elongation of the alkyl chain leads to a dramatic drop in
ECAS values: to be specific, from 94.6 m2 gPt–1 on Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2], to 61.9 m2 gPt–1 on Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2], and then
41.0 m2 gPt–1 on Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2]. It is not uncommon to
observe the ECAS loss for a Pt/C catalyst after IL modification. For
instance, we observed in our previous work that ECAS of Pt/C was reduced
by up to 19.2% after surface modification using [MTBD][NTf2] (Scheme S1). Similarly, Huang et al.
reported that Pt/C modified with [MTBD][C4F9SO3] (Scheme S1) suffered 28%
ECAS loss relative to the pristine Pt/C.37 Nevertheless, our current work confirms that the effect of IL modification
on ECAS depends sensitively on the specific structure of ILs, even
for the ILs from the same category.

Pt/C catalysts recorded
in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at a scan
rate of 20 mV s–1. (b) ECAS and surface coverage
of oxygenated species calculated from CV curves on the Pt/C catalysts
with and without IL modification.

Meanwhile, it can be noticed that the oxidation peaks beyond
0.6
V are attenuated on all the IL-modified samples with respect to that
of the Pt/C (Figure 3a). This indicates that the presence of the IL phase can suppress
the formation of oxygenated species on Pt, which is consistent with
previous reports.31,33,35−37 For the IL-modified Pt/C catalysts, the hydrophobicity
of the IL phase at the Pt/C catalyst surfaces is thought to create
a hydrophobic microenvironment at the interface between the catalyst
and aqueous electrolyte, which can help preserve the active Pt sites
from being partially oxidized or forming oxygenated species by repelling
water molecules.36 It should be be noted
that the surface oxygenated species on Pt is considered to be nonreactive
and will lead to blockage of Pt active sites.28 Herein, attempts were also made to quantify the coverage of the
nonreactive oxygenated species (θOHad) on Pt. As
displayed in Figure 3b, side chain elongation in imidazolium cations leads to a substantial
decrease in θOHad values. It can be found that, despite
the unwanted passivation of active Pt surfaces, the presence of an
IL with a longer cationic chain (n > 6) can indeed
make the rest of the active surfaces be less prone to forming nonreactive
oxygenated species.

The electrocatalytic properties of these
IL-modified samples toward
the ORR were investigated and compared with those of the pristine
Pt/C using thin-film RDE techniques. Figure 4a compares their ORR polarization curves
recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte,
where it can be seen that the curves of most of the IL-modified Pt/C
samples have positively shifted relative to that of the pristine Pt/C.
The only exception is Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2], whose polarization curve has shifted negatively by 53 mV
instead. It is well documented that the ORR can proceed either through
the two-electron pathway to produce H2O2 or
four-electron pathway to produce water. To clarify whether the cationic
chain length of ILs has an influence on the ORR pathways, we have
conducted RRDE measurements on Pt/C samples with and without IL. As
shown in Figure S3, in which the upper
panel displays the mole fraction of H2O2 formation,
it can be seen that the H2O2 fraction is lower
than 4% for all of the investigated samples, and their plots of mole
fraction of the formed H2O2 are comparable.
These results indicate that the ORR is proceeding mainly through the
preferred four-electron pathway to produce water, and neither the
presence of IL nor the cationic chain length has imposed any significant
effect on the ORR pathway on these catalysts. To quantify their difference
in ORR activity, the specific activity (SA) and mass specific activity
(MSA) at 0.9 V were calculated and are compared in Figure 4b. It is notable that Pt activity
strongly correlates with the cationic chain length of ILs, and a distinct
dependence of SA and MSA on the cationic chain length with the maximum
activity obtained on Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] can be identified. The hydrophobicity of the catalyst surface conveyed
by hydrophobic ILs is believed to help preserve active sites from
being oxidized by water and thereafter results in an enhanced overall
reaction rate. Thus, it is expected that the more hydrophobic IL with
a longer alkyl chain length would more efficiently boost the ORR rate,
and it is not surprising to observe that ORR proceeded more quickly
on Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] in comparison
to that on Pt/C-[C2C1im][NTf2]. However,
further elongation of the alkyl chain length from C4 to C10 leads
to an decrease in SA from 1.10 mA cmPt–2 on Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2], to 0.90
mA cmPt–2 on Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2] and 0.18 mA cm–2Pt on Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2].
This trend is quite similar to the ECAS drop in response to the elongation
of the alkyl chain from C4 to C10, which hints that the critical changes
in structure/property of these IL-modified samples would occur at
the transition from Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] to Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2].

curves of IL-modified Pt/C catalysts and the
pristine Pt/C recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. (b) Comparisons
of mass and specific activity of Pt toward the ORR at 0.9 V on the
pristine and IL-modified Pt/C catalysts.

In order to probe the interactions between ILs and Pt nanoparticles,
we carried out CO-stripping measurements on the pristine and IL-modified
Pt/C samples. The background-subtracted CO-stripping voltammetric
profiles are shown in Figure 5a. It can be seen that the CO-stripping signal on Pt/C features
a prepeak and a main peak centered at 0.75 and 0.83 V, respectively.
Interestingly, the clearly resolved prepeak on Pt/C, which is thought
to originate from CO oxidation on low-coordinated Pt sites,51−53 becomes less pronounced on all of the IL-modified Pt/C samples.
To better distinguish the influence of chain length on the CO-stripping
signals, the ECAS values obtained accordingly to CO stripping charges
are compared in Figure 5b. The individual contributions of the prepeak and the main peak
to ECASCO for each sample were roughly estimated by splitting
the CO-stripping signal as described in the Experimental
Section. It can be seen clearly that the share of the prepeak
to the total CO-stripping signals decreases with elongation of the
cationic chain length from C4 (6.2%) to C6 (3.9%) and almost completely
vanishes on C10 (0.7%). Furthermore, the main CO-stripping peaks on
all of the IL-modified samples are positively shifted, indicating
a stronger bonding of CO molecules on Pt surfaces in the presence
of IL, which is consistent with our previous report,36 while the main peaks on the Pt/C samples modified by ILs
with relatively shorter cationic side chains (i.e., [C2C1im][NTf2] and [C4C1im][NTf2]) can retain the same peak height as that on
the pristine Pt/C. However, further elongation of the cationic side
chain from C4 to C10 would lead to a reduction in peak area (ECASCO) contributed by the main peaks (Figure 5b), which is in line with the aforementioned
decrease of the ECAS in response to the side-chain elongation. These
results imply that the IL molecules would preferentially locate at
the low-coordinated edge/corner/defect Pt sites regardless of the
cationic chain length, while with the elongation of the side chain
(n > 6), the IL molecules will start interacting
with the terrace sites probably through the long side chain, leading
to blockage of terrace Pt sites.

curves and (b) summary of
ECAS calculated on the basis of CO-stripping peaks on the pristine
and IL-modified Pt/C catalysts. The values in (b) indicate the proportion
of ECAS contributed by the prepeaks.

3.3 Accelerated Degradation Tests
To
assess the electrochemical stability of different catalysts toward
the ORR, we adapted a relatively harsh accelerated degradation test
(ADT) protocol by conducting repeated CV tests in the potential range
of 0.4–1.4 V at a scan rate of 1 V s–1.54 The loading amount of Pt on RDE was fixed (20.4
μg·cm–2) to enable a fair comparison,
considering that the exact loading of Pt may influence the stability
performance.54,55 The voltammograms and the ORR
polarization curves of different catalysts before and after the ADT
are shown in Figures S4 and S5, respectively. Figure 6 summarizes the corresponding
changes in ECAS and the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2). After 2000 cycles, the ORR polarization curve of
the pristine Pt/C was negatively shifted by 30 mV, along with a reduction
in ECAS by 65%, demonstrating that the pristine Pt/C sample suffered
severe degradation during the ADT. It can be seen in Figure 6 that the IL-modified samples
generally exhibit improved electrochemical stability relative to the
pristine Pt/C, as reflected by the fact that the ECAS value is reduced
by 51% on the Pt/C-[C2C1im][NTf2],
47% on the Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2], and
38% on the Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2], while
the ECAS of Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2]
is fully retained after the ADT. It is also noteworthy that after
the ADT both Pt/C-[C2C1im][NTf2]
and Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] still show
higher half-wave potentials in comparison to the pristine Pt/C, despite
the fact that their polarization curves are negatively shifted by
21 and 18 mV, respectively (Figure 6b). Meanwhile, it can be observed that the stabilizing
effect of the IL seems to be insensitive to the nature of the cations,
as indicated by the comparable drop in the half-wave potentials for
the IL-modified samples with IL cationic chain length ranging from
C2 to C6. The only exception is Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2], its ORR polarization curve being positively shifted, which
might arise from the restructuring of IL molecules that strongly interact
with the Pt surfaces. Further experiment and/or simulation work needs
to be carried out to verify this hypothesis, while these efforts would
be beyond the scope of the current work. In any event, the above results
demonstrate that the presence of the IL helps improve the electrochemical
stability of a Pt catalyst, which is consistent with the previous
reports that the presence of an IL phase can bring enhanced electrochemical
stability of various Pt-based electrocatalysts relative to their counterparts
without IL.35,41,56 At the same time, it is verified that the boosting effect from IL
modification can be maintained even under the harsh ADT conditions,
which is of great significance for their practical applications.

Figure 6 Comparison
of the electrochemically active surface area (a) and
half-wave potential (b) of the pristine and IL-modified Pt/C catalysts
before and after 2000 potential cycles between 0.4 and 1.4 V in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4.

In order to unambiguously explore the degradation mechanism
of
these Pt/C samples toward the ORR, we employed the identical-location
TEM technique to probe the structural change of the pristine Pt/C
and the most promising Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] before and after ADT tests. As shown in Figure 7a–d, the most striking
effect induced by the potential cycling on the structures of the pristine
Pt/C sample is severe dissolution of Pt nanoparticles, as evidenced
by the fact that the same particles become much smaller after the
ADT. Some particles even completely disappear after the ADT, which
can be caused by either Pt dissolution or particle detachment from
carbon supports. While considering that the carbon support is still
intact and no obvious change in shape of the carbon spheres can be
observed, we tend to believe that the particle loss would mainly take
place following the dissolution mechanism, which is in accordance
with previous reports.57,58 A different picture emerges for
Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2], for which the
Pt nanoparticles are well retained without any pronounced change in
particle sizes after the ADT, as illustrated in Figure 7e–h. The integrity of the carbon-supported
Pt nanoparticles strongly indicates that the presence of an IL can
suppress the Pt dissolution, which agrees with the aforementioned
suppressed oxidation of Pt on IL-modified Pt/C catalysts. At the same
time, it can be seen that particles in close vicinity tend to merge
into larger ones, corresponding to “particle coalescence”,
another mechanism leading to degradation of Pt catalysts. On the basis
of these results, it can be concluded that the presence of an IL can
indeed improve the electrochemical stability the Pt/C sample mainly
by suppressing the dissolution of Pt nanoparticles; however, the IL
seems incapable of fully preventing the particles from coalescing.

and the Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] (e–h)
before and after the stability test.

To further probe the Pt dissolution behavior of the pristine
and
IL-modified Pt/C catalysts during the ADTs, the concentration of dissolved
Pt during the ADT was quantified using an in situ SFC-ICP-MS setup.46,59 As summarized in Figure S6, we can see
a trend in stability toward Pt dissolution for IL-modified catalysts.
Quantification shows that the Pt mass losses after the ADT are decreased
from 46.6 ± 7.8% on the pristine Pt/C to 35.7 ± 1.8% on
the Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2], providing
the second piece of evidence that the presence of an IL can stabilize
Pt catalysts during the ADT. At the same time, we can also observe
that the IL-modified Pt/C samples exhibit similar dissolution amounts
of Pt after ADT regardless of the cationic chain length of the ILs,
which is consistent with the above electrochemical measurements. It
appears that, although the nature of cations imposes a significant
effect on the catalytic activity of these IL-modified Pt/C catalysts,
it may play a minor role in affecting the electrochemical stability.

Moreover, to better resolve the Pt dissolution at the pristine
and IL-modified Pt/C catalysts, we carried out additional SFC-ICP-MS
experiments by monitoring the Pt dissolution profiles during four
consecutive CV tests between 0.05 and 1.5 V at a scan rate of 10 mV
s–1. As shown in Figure 8, for each CV cycle there are two significant
dissolution peaks for both samples, while the more dominant dissolution
peak emerges in the reverse scan. It can also be noticed that the
dissolution peak intensity decreases with an increase in the cycle
number, i.e., the Pt dissolution rate is gradually decreasing, which
is in accordance with a previous report.59 At the same time, it is noteworthy that the Pt dissolution peak
intensity is significantly lower on the Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] than on the pristine Pt/C. These results confirm
again that the presence of an IL plays an important role in stabilizing
the Pt catalysts.

4 Discussion
We observed that the electrochemical properties as ECAS, electrocatalytic
properties toward the ORR, and CO-stripping behavior exhibited a unique
dependent behavior on the cationic chain length of the ILs used for
Pt surface modification. Especially intriguing is that two regimes
can be observed, when the cationic chain length of ILs is elongated.
The first regime is from C2 to C4, where ECAS values similar to that
of the pristine catalyst can be obtained, but the specific activity
increases with IL modification and chain length. The second regime
is from C6 to C10, where a higher specific activity (C6) can also
be obtained, but the ECAS and mass specific activity drop significantly
when the chain length is elongated. This implies that cationic chain
elongation from C4 to C6 pronouncedly changes the interactions taking
place among the IL, aqueous electrolyte, and platinum.

For ORR
in aqueous electrolyte, water is believed to play an important
role in the whole process. For instance, water molecules are considered
to be the major source of the nonreactive oxygenated species,28,60,61 and interface water itself at
electrode surfaces may also directly block the Pt sites, as suggested
by Jinnouchi et al. on the basis of their combined DFT and Poisson–Boltzmann
calculations.62 Moreover, the dissolved
water in the IL phase could promote proton transportation from the
aqueous electrolyte to the Pt surfaces through the IL phase.33,36 Both theory and experiment indicate that ILs with longer cationic
chains possess lower water content,63,64 which can
be rationalized by the fact that a longer nonpolar cationic tail of
the IL would cause larger structural mismatching on interaction with
water molecules, leading to a higher misfit energy and consequently
a lower water solubility.64 Therefore,
an intuitive rationale for the dependence of electrochemical properties
of those IL-modified catalysts on the cationic chain lengths of ILs
would lie in their different water contents. If this is the case,
we would expect a significant decrease in water contents when the
cationic chain is elongated from C4 to C6, to be compliant with the
dramatically different structural/catalytic properties of Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] and Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2]. Nevertheless, the difference in water
content between [C4C1im][NTf2] and
[C6C1im][NTf2] is actually quite
minor, i.e., 0.25 vs 0.21 in terms of the mole fraction solubility
of water in ILs at room temperature,63 which
seems unlikely to be fully responsible for the significantly different
ECAS and θOHad values between Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] (94.6 m2 gPt–1, 17%), and Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2] (61.9 m2 gPt–1,
9%). Actually, the difference in water content between [C2C1im][NTf2] (0.30) and [C4C1im][NTf2] (0.25) is even slightly larger,63 and the comparable ECAS and θOHad values of Pt/C-[C2C1im][NTf2] and
Pt/C-[C4C1im][NTf2] further verify
that, although the water content of ILs would decrease with the elongation
of cationic chains, it might play a minor role in determining the
electrocatalytic performance of these IL-modified Pt/C catalysts.
Therefore, apart from the differences in water content among various
ILs, elongation of the cationic chain must have caused some essential
changes in the structures of ILs over Pt surfaces, which will be discussed
in the following section.

It is well documented that ILs with
long alkyl chains tend to form
lipid- or micelle-like aggregates.65−69 For instance, Perkin et al. investigated the layered
structures of [C4C1im][NTf2] and
[C6C1im][NTf2] at an atomically smooth
mica surface by using a surface force balance and revealed that elongation
of alkyl chain length from C4 to C6 led to a structure transformation
from the alternating cation and anion monolayer structure of [C4C1im][NTf2] to the lipid-like bilayer
structure of [C6C1im][NTf2].69 Voth et al. proposed on the basis of their molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations that the alkyl chain of imidazolium cations
would aggregate and form micelle-like structures when the cationic
chain is elongated from C4 to C8.67 Similarly,
Klein et al. investigated the effect of alkyl chain length of imidazolium
cations on the IL structure in the presence of water and suggested
that a micelle-like structure would form for [C6C1im][Br] and [C8C1im][Br], but this is not the
case for [C4C1im][Br], the short butyl chain
of which is less likely to aggregate.70−72 Venkatnathan et al.
also reported that an IL with long alkyl chain length, i.e., [C6C1im][NTf2], tended to form a micelle-like
structure in contact with an excess amount of water on the basis of
their MD simulations.65 Taking these experiment
and simulation findings into account, it seems that the lipid-/micelle-like
structure would likely form for ILs with long alkyl chain (n ≥ 6) due to the spontaneous aggregation of their
long nonpolar cationic tails.

Here in the current study, we
also found that the essential change
in structural and catalytic properties of these IL-modified Pt/C catalysts
would occur when the cationic side-chain length of ILs increased from
C4 to C6. As evidenced by the CO-stripping measurements, the IL molecules
would preferentially interact with the low-coordinated Pt sites (e.g.,
edge, corner) regardless of the alkyl chain length, while for the
ILs with relatively long cationic chains (n >
6),
the IL cations would block the terrace Pt sites and lead to significant
loss in ECSA, which is not the case for the short-chain ILs. These
findings lead us to hypothesize that the interactions between IL molecules
and Pt surfaces would be dependent on the specific cationic chain
length. The ILs with long cationic chains, i.e. [C6C1im][NTf2] and [C10C1im][NTf2], would likely compromise their mobility adapting the aforementioned
lipid-/micelle-like structure on solid Pt catalysts due to the spontaneous
aggregation of their long nonpolar cation tails.

Nevertheless,
in the aforementioned studies, the formation of the
lipid-/micelle-like structures of ILs was predicted without considering
the Coulomb interactions of IL anions/cations with electrified surfaces
or the associated formation of an electrochemical double layer whose
structure depends strongly on the applied electrode potentials. For
the electrochemical measurements carried out by applying variable
potentials, as in the current study, a dynamic structure of ILs in
contact with platinum is to be expected, which complicates the picture
of the interfacial structure of IL molecules at electrode surfaces.73−76 Unfortunately, the dynamic response of IL structures to the variation
of electrode potentials is still poorly understood, while consensus
suggests that the ILs would adopt a charge-separated layered structure:
i.e., with alternating cation- and anion-rich layers at electrified
surfaces.73 Following this line of reasoning,
at a positively polarized electrode, which is relevant to the ORR
conditions, the [NTf2]− anions are enriched
at the innermost layer (Stern) of the electrode to compensate for
the positive charge of the electrode, while the second layer (overlayer)
will be dominated by the cations. The ion proportions at each layer
depend on the magnitude of electrode polarization.75 Taking all this information into account, we can expect
that the IL structures at the electrode surfaces are determined by
the counterbalance between van der Waals and Coulombic interactions.
Accordingly, a simplified picture of IL structures on electrode catalyst
is shown schematically in Figure 9, where water and oxygen molecules are not shown for
clarity. A positively charged surface was chosen for illustration
because it is more relevant to the operation conditions of a cathode
(positive electrode) in a fuel cell, and the innermost layer close
to the electrode is expected to be enriched by the anions due to electrostatic
attraction. For the long-chain ILs, cations would self-assemble into
a bilayer structure with polar head groups (imidazolium ring) pointing
toward the aqueous electrolyte or interacting with the innermost anion
layer as proposed by Kornyshev,74 while
this may not be the case for the short-chain cations which should
have much higher mobility (Figure 9a). We have to admit that this picture should be viewed
with caution, especially considering the poorly understood dynamics
of IL structures in response to the varying potentials and the ill-defined
nature of interactions between IL cations/anions and metal surfaces.
For instance, we cannot rule out the possibility that some cations
would still stay at the innermost layer at the positively polarized
electrode, which can be a consequence of either the strong interaction
between cations and metal surfaces or the tardy dynamic response of
cations to the varying potentials. As demonstrated by Nelson et al.
on the basis of their neutron reflectometry and electrochemical analyses,
a cation ([C4C1pyr]+)-rich interface
was found even at a positively charged Au electrode (1.3 V above the
potential of zero charge) due to the specific adsorption of [C4C1pyr]+ on Au, while as expected the
cations at the innermost layer depopulated at increasing potentials.77

Figure 9 Schematic illustrations for the likely structures of IL-modified
Pt/C samples with short (a) and long (b) alkyl chains in imidazolium
cations on positively polarized electrodes. Water and oxygen molecules
are not shown in the schemes for clarity. The schemes are not drawn
to scale.

Despite this uncertainty, as presented
in Figure 9, the most
significant feature for the long-chain
ILs would be their tendency to form a lipid-like bilayer structure,
which turns out to have both positive and negative consequences. On
one hand, this structure can more efficiently protect Pt sites from
being oxidized or forming nonreactive oxygenated species by repelling
water molecules due to its rigid bilayer structure along with the
highly hydrophobic microenvironment created at the interface between
the solid catalyst and aqueous electrolyte, which can be justified
by the lower θOHad values of Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2] and Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2] in comparison to those of the other samples;
on the other hand, this structure causes partial blockage of Pt sites,
leading to a much lower ECAS value for the sample with long-chain
ILs. The attenuation or vanishment of the prepeaks along with the
reduction in the main peak intensity of CO stripping on Pt/C-[C6C1im][NTf2] and Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2] also indicates that the long-chain
ILs can partially passivate/block the Pt terrace sites. In addition,
the much lower specific activity of Pt/C-[C10C1im][NTf2] (0.18 mA cmPt–2) for the ORR implies that the surface blockage of Pt surface sites
not only leads to the loss of Pt active site number but may also break
the ensemble of Pt active sites required for high turnover rates of
the ORR through the so-called third-body effect.78 Moreover, as evidenced by the positively shifted CO-stripping
peaks in the CO-stripping measurements, the presence of ILs on Pt
catalysts can also strengthen the bonding of CO molecules on Pt. These
results indicate that the IL might also play a role in altering the
surface electronic structure through a ligand effect, promoting the
activation of O2 molecules on Pt, which can also contribute
to the accelerated ORR kinetics on the IL-modified Pt catalysts. On
the basis of these results, we can get a more comprehensive picture
about the role of ILs in affecting the electrocatalytic properties
of a solid catalyst. That is, in addition to the well-documented beneficial
effect from IL modification including high O2 solubility
in IL and suppressed formation of nonreactive oxygenated species,
the ligand effect, surface passivation/blockage, and ensemble (third-body)
effect originating from IL modification have long been overlooked
and have turned out to play important roles in controlling the overall
reaction rate, which can be optimized by finely tuning the IL molecular
structures.

The above picture also sheds new light on understanding
the improved
electrochemical stability of the IL-modified Pt/C catalysts. As mentioned
above, Pt dissolution is found to be the major reason for the degradation
of the pristine Pt/C catalyst, and it is documented that low-coordinated
(edge/corner/defect) Pt sites are more prone to dissolution and indeed
act as the starting sites for the initial oxidative dissolution of
a Pt nanoparticle.79,80 Interestingly, as evidenced by
the attenuated CO-stripping prepeaks on all of the IL-modified Pt/C
samples, the IL molecules (most likely the [NTf2]− anions for a positively polarized electrode) would preferentially
interact with those low-coordinated Pt sites. These results lead us
to conclude that the presence of an IL improves the electrochemical
stability of Pt/C catalysts through suppression of the formation of
chemisorbed oxygenated species and/or the initial oxidation of low-coordinated
Pt sites located at the edge, corner, and/or defect Pt sites. Thus,
the [NTf2]− anions seem to be mainly
responsible for increasing the electrochemical stability, which would
explain the observed similarly lowered dissolution rate of Pt irrespective
of the cations. This result highlights the importance of understanding
the nature of the molecular interactions between IL molecules and
electrode surfaces, especially under dynamic potentials. Further extensive
spectroscopic (e.g., IRAS, XPS) and microscopic (e.g., STM, AFM) analyses
of the IL-modified model/practical catalysts, especially under the
electrochemical operation conditions, and also the perspectives of
simulation studies (e.g., MD simulations of electrified surfaces in
contact with ILs) are still greatly needed before a more fundamental
understanding can be obtained about the interactions between varied
IL molecules and electrified metal surfaces.

5 Conclusions
In conclusion, the current work verified again the boosting effect
of ILs toward the ORR on Pt catalysts by using a wide variety of imidazolium-based
ILs. More importantly, we have discovered that the electrocatalytic
properties of IL-modified Pt/C catalysts can be regulated by rationally
tuning the structures of ILs at a molecular level, and the proper
length of the cationic alkyl chain holds the key to obtaining a promising
ORR catalyst. Specifically, the IL with an alkyl chain that is too
short (e.g., [C2C1im][NTf2]) cannot
fully boost the activity of Pt for the ORR because its limited hydrophobicity
cannot efficiently suppress the formation of nonreactive oxygenated
species on Pt, while an IL with alkyl chain that is too long (e.g.,
[C6C1im][NTf2], [C10C1im][NTf2]) would lead to a dramatic loss in both
active surface area and intrinsic activity of Pt probably due to the
formation of rigid lipid-like bilayer structures. Therefore, the chain
length of an IL can be used as a regulator to tune the electrocatalytic
properties of a Pt-based ORR catalyst, and an optimized IL structure
for an active Pt catalyst is thought to have a proper chain length
which can provide sufficient hydrophobicity without triggering the
formation of a lipid-/micelle-like structure or loss of active sites.
While the cationic structure of ILs has a great influence on the intrinsic
activity of Pt, the promising improvement in electrocatalytic stability
of Pt/C catalysts appears to stem from the interaction/blockage of
low-coordinated Pt sites by the anions. As evidenced by the identical-location
TEM and in situ SFC-ICP-MS analyses, the presence of ILs could effectively
suppress Pt dissolution, which is thought to be the major cause for
the degradation of the pristine Pt/C catalyst. We believe that these
findings could be exploited to develop active and stable Pt-saving
electrocatalysts for fuel cell catalysis and may also have broad implications
for constructing other high-performing catalytic systems following
the SCILL concept.
