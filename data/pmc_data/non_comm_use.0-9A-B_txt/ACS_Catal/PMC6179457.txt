Materials used for
photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS)
are typically composed of light-absorbing semiconductor crystals,
functionalized with so-called cocatalytic nanoparticles to improve
the kinetics of the hydrogen and/or oxygen evolution reactions. While
function, quantity, and protection of such metal(oxide) nanoparticles
have been addressed in the literature of photocatalysis, the stability
and transients in the active oxidation-state upon illumination have
received relatively little attention. In this Perspective, the latest
insights in the active state of frequently applied cocatalysts systems,
including Pt, Rh/Cr2O3, or Ni/NiOx, will be presented. While the initial morphology
and oxidation state of such nanoparticles is a strong function of
the applied preparation procedure, significant changes in these properties
can occur during water splitting. We discuss these changes in relation
to the nature of the cocatalyst/semiconductor interface. We also show
how know-how of other disciplines such as heterogeneous catalysis
or electro-catalysis and recent advances in analytical methodology
can help to determine the active state of cocatalytic nanoparticles
in photocatalytic applications.

Photocatalytic conversion of
solar energy is considered an ideal route to produce chemical fuels
from abundant feedstocks like water.1−4

Photocatalytic overall water splitting
(POWS) is a thermodynamically
unfavorable uphill reaction (ΔG > 0), and
to
achieve a techno–economically competitive hydrogen production
process, it is critical to develop a photocatalytic water splitting
system with high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies (>10%) and
long-term
stability.5,6 In photocatalysis, efficiencies are determined
by (i) the optical properties of the applied semiconductor, that is,
band gap or light absorption efficiency (ηabs), and
(ii) the charge separation efficiency (ηsep). Significant
progress has been made in the last decades in the development of new
semiconductor materials, yet relatively low overall conversion efficiencies
of the available (composite) materials have prevented the practical
implementation of solar fuel production by (heterogeneous) photocatalysis.6

Based on the common perception that optimum
performance requires
optimized optical and electrical properties (i.e., a bulk band structure
that enables absorption of larger fractions of visible light (≤600
nm) and efficient separation of generated charge carriers with little
loss by recombination), the development of novel semiconductor materials
is dominating the research efforts of the community.

In heterogeneous
photocatalysis, liquid (aqueous electrolyte) −solid
(semiconductor) interfaces are formed. Usually n-type semiconductors
are employed, and interfacial charge separation is achieved by an
upward band bending caused by the adjustment of the Femi levels of
the semiconductor and the electrolyte (establishing thermodynamic
equilibrium).7 Upon illumination (using
illumination intensities insufficient to establish flat band potentials,
e.g. by fully reversing band bending) positive charges generated in
the depletion regime will be effectively transferred to the semiconductor/electrolyte
interface, whereas electrons are transferred to the bulk. Nevertheless,
transfer of the majority carriers (electrons) to the surface is essential
to drive the reduction of protons. Therefore, metal nanoparticles
are usually employed, which facilitate electron accumulation at the
surface (for further information about charge separation, band bending,
etc., the readers are referred to existing textbooks and reviews7−9).

Another important function of the metal(oxide) nanoparticles
is
to achieve effective POWS by promoting surface reactions (ηcat),10,11 and in fact, a proper alignment
of bulk properties and surface catalysis is required to fully utilize
the intrinsic properties of a semiconductor for overall water splitting
(Figure 1). Usually
ηcat of semiconductor surfaces is low (high overpotentials
and slow kinetics for the catalytic H2 and O2 evolution or CO2 reduction) causing severe surface recombination
of charge carriers. It is important to emphasize that in comparison
to heterogeneous catalysis, in photocatalysis the cocatalytic nanoparticles
are not thermally activated but rather by the light-driven generation
of charges in the semiconductor, followed by charge transfer across
the interface of the applied semiconductor and the metal(oxide) nanoparticles.
After successful transfer of charges (electrons to drive HER), the
cocatalysts (electrocatalyst) allow redox reactions by lowering the
overpotential of electron transfer reactions, similar to electrocatalysis.8,9,12

Figure 1 (Left) Schematic representation of photocatalysis.
Illumination
of a semiconductor with the efficiency, ηads, is
followed by charge carrier separation ηsep and the
surface redox reaction occurring at the surface of the cocatalyst
particles, ηcat. Here, dual cocatalyst functionalizations
(e.g. hydrogen and oxygen evolution) are driven by different cocatalysts.
(Right) Co-catalysts can be dynamic in nature, and a few examples
of feasible changes of the cocatalyst are sketched.

Suitable materials for a specific reaction can
thus be chosen following
the guidelines established by electrochemists. For instance, noble
and non-noble metals (Pt, Rh, Ru, Au, or Ni),13−16 metal sulfides (e.g., MoS2 or NiS),17,18 or metal phosphides (e.g., NiP
or FeP)19 are well-known constituents of
electrodes used in water or carbon dioxide reduction. The community
studying electrochemistry is also well aware of the fact that metal
oxides (IrOx, MnOx, and CoOx)20−22 and metal oxyhydroxides
(NiOOH, or FeOOH)23,24 promote water oxidation. Several
of these materials (Rh, Ni, Pt for reductive hydrogen evolution) are
commonly applied as cocatalysts in heterogeneous photocatalysis. It
should be mentioned that in photocatalytic overall water splitting,
activity is the primary criterion for selection of the composition
of the cocatalytic nanoparticles, while electrochemical selectivity
receives little attention.25 An exception
is the consideration of the back reaction in water splitting (i.e.,
the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen to water) because these products
are formed in close proximity. Conversion of oxygen and hydrogen to
form water can be triggered (i) electrochemically by reduction of
oxygen (the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)) or the oxidation of hydrogen
(the hydrogen oxidation reaction, (HOR)) on the hydrogen and oxygen
evolution sites of the cocatalysts, or (ii) thermally by catalytic
activation of hydrogen or oxygen.6 While
electrochemically induced hydrogen or oxygen activation is only feasible
under illumination (initiating the required electrochemistry), thermal
activation is feasible in the dark, albeit this is likely enhanced
during illumination by the possible presence of local hotspots.

To achieve electrochemical selectivity for the “forward”
hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water, in earlier studies, solution
additives (carbonate salts)26 and sodium
hydroxide coatings27 were suggested, whereas
in recent literature, primarily core–shell structures are used.6,25 Frequently applied core–shell structures are chromium oxide
(e.g., Rh/Cr2O3) or nickel oxide (Ni/NiOx).6 Titanium dioxide
and lanthanide oxides were also reported as applicable shell material.28 Here, it is interesting to note that the same
principles have already been applied for decades in the chlorate industry,
showcasing the successful adaption in heterogeneous photocatalysis.
In the chlorate industry deposition of a CrOx film on the cathode is essential to facilitate selective hydrogen
formation and to prevent reduction of oxychlorides. Despite its frequent
use, the exact structure, working mechanism, and location of the electrocatalytic
hydrogen evolution reaction are not yet exactly known, and consequently,
the purpose of these oxides in heterogeneous photocatalysis might
also be diverse.29,30

Apart from the benefits
of lower overpotentials and favorable kinetics,
functionalization of semiconductor surfaces by metallic, metal oxide,
or even core–shell structured cocatalysts adds additional complexity
to the development and understanding of photocatalytic materials.6 Different time scales of photoexcitation and
catalytic events are still inevitable, and positive or negative charging
of cocatalysts particles by trapping of charge carriers (in turn potentially
increasing ηsep) will occur during prolonged illumination.11 Furthermore, the location of the respective
cocatalysts driving reductive (H2 evolution, CO2 reduction) or oxidative (O2 evolution) reactions and
the interface between the semiconductor surface and the cocatalyst
are of importance. The interface has to be carefully designed to generate
drift currents by an effective and adequate potential gradient as
recently pointed out by Takanabe et al.,11 and it is important to realize that these gradients might not be
achieved by random arrangement of cocatalyst particles of various
sizes. For very small-sized particles, the electronic structure of
cocatalyst (or of a semiconductor) will even be defined by quantum
size effects.

In contrast to photoelectrocatalytic processes,
where materials
for reductive and oxidative processes can be optimized independently,
for particulate semiconductor materials favorable interfaces and depositing
cocatalysts at preferred locations must be realized on a (single)
semiconductor particle, underlining the fact that photocatalysis must
be considered as a multidisciplinary field of research. Among others,
expertise in semiconductor physics, (in)organic materials chemistry,
and (electro-)catalysis is required to develop efficient systems and
fully understand individual functions of multicomponent photocatalysts.32−34

The cocatalyst loading is commonly of primary concern and
a typical
relationship between loading and activity of photocatalysts is depicted
in Figure 2. This simple
relationship does not account for differences in the active state
of a cocatalyst as a function of loading, nor for the effectiveness
of interfaces of semiconductor/cocatalysts (potential shifts) and
likely overestimates the required loading of cocatalysts. Another
common mistake is that the same cocatalyst loading (and cocatalyst
material) is applied to measure the activity of different semiconductor
materials (or the same semiconductor material with different morphology
and/or particle sizes causing changes in the density of state and
different/incomplete band bending due to quantum size effects). However,
optimization of loading and accompanied dispersion of nanoparticles,
might be dependent on the applied semiconductor. Moreover, the semiconductor/cocatalyst
interface might be different, and these factors determining photocatalytic
properties are typically not addressed.35

Heterogeneous photocatalysts are usually tested in recirculating
batch reactor systems and their activity is defined by the amount
of accumulated gas species detected by methods such as gas chromatography.
Due to detection limits and the generally slow data acquisition first
data points are only obtained after prolonged illumination of about
1 h. This realistic and potentially scalable approach (batch-type
bags5,36) circumvents that changes in the photocatalytic
properties during the “start-up phase” can be revealed.
Changes during start-up are known from heterogeneous catalysis, and
recently we have shown that dramatic changes in the photocatalytic
performance of heterogeneous photocatalysts occur during initial illumination:
steady-state activity is only obtained after several minutes/hours.37,38 We were able to assign changes in the photocatalytic behavior to
changes of the cocatalyst using differential reactor operation and
fast product detection.36,39

In summary, it
is widely recognized that the use of one or more
cocatalyst compositions on the surface of a semiconductor is indispensable
to achieve high efficiencies.40 However,
there is still little experimental proof for the operating mechanism
and active morphology and oxidation state during photocatalytic operation.8,9 Here, we will focus specifically on transients in the composition
of cocatalysts upon illumination, and highlight the need to use advanced
in situ or operando characterization methods to determine the ”real”
active state of cocatalysts. Furthermore, determining dissolved ions
after testing and postcatalytic transformations of the cocatalysts
(e.g., particle growth) should be revealed. This appears to be especially
important for complex core–shell systems. Defining the active
state is also mandatory to fully describe the properties of the different
interfaces (semiconductor/cocatalyst, semiconductor/electrolyte).

Transient
Behavior of Pt and Ni/NiO Cocatalysts: Examples of
Cocatalyst Rearrangement
As previously indicated, it is known
that a volcano-like shape
describes the relationship of cocatalyst loading and photocatalytic
activity (Figure 2).41 This simplified dependence ignores size-dependent
electronic structures and activities, transients in composition, and
deactivation of deposited nanoparticles.

The deactivation of
a cocatalyst/semiconductor composite might
occur because of (1) changes of the light absorbing semiconductor
material (e.g., by corrosion);

(2) changes/rearrangement of the applied
cocatalysts, in particular modification of the physiochemical properties
of a cocatalyst, such as oxidation state, phase composition, particle
size and atomic structure.



As the stability
of photocatalytic composite materials is usually
revealed by repetitive testing in batch reactors and subsequent standard
(bulk) characterization methods such as X-ray diffraction or UV–vis
spectroscopy, deactivation of the semiconductor can be easily recognized
(e.g., for sulfide-based materials, corrosion is a prominent pathway
for deactivation).42 These routines might
be feasible to predict stability of composite photocatalysts in steady-state
conditions, however, deactivation during the initial stages of catalytic
testing are not resolved. Furthermore, structural/electronic changes
of the cocatalyst present in low quantities on the semiconductor surface
are not accessible by standard bulk characterization.

For Pt-modified
SrTiO3,37 prepared by photodeposition
in the absence of sacrificial agents,
transients in oxygen evolution were observed and steady-state conditions
were only achieved after extended illumination. Surface characterization
with particular emphasis on Pt characterization was performed. XPS
revealed that the excess of formed oxygen was well-correlated with
a reduction of the as-prepared PtOx to
metallic Pt. While the formation of metallic Pt during illumination
on an n-type material might not be surprising, these measurements
nicely demonstrate that photodeposition of Pt in the absence of sacrificial
agents is a slow process, and full reduction might only be achieved
during photocatalytic testing. Moreover, in the same study Pt-modified
Rh:SrTiO3 was prepared and characterized using the same
approach. Interestingly, for prereduced metallic Pt on Rh:SrTiO3 oxidation occurred during the testing, and the “active”
Pt-species in steady-state conditions resembled PtOx rather than metallic Pt. Clearly the presence of a dopant
not only influences the optical properties of the semiconductor but
also changes the interfacial charge transfer phenomena and, consequently,
the oxidation state of the cocatalyst (Pt).

In electrochemistry,
the oxidation state of active Pt anodes has
also been discussed, and generally oxidation of the surface occurs
before oxygen is evolved. The chemical potential of the photogenerated
holes in the semiconductor are likely sufficient to drive the partial
oxidation of Pt to PtOx in particular
on p-type semiconductors. It has been proposed that Rh:SrTiO3 is in fact a p-type semiconductor.38 Apart
from the electrochemically driven oxide formation, thermal growth
of surface oxides must be considered because of the presence of local
hot spots governed by intensive illumination. This certainly highlights
that post-catalysis characterization is required
to fully describe the composition of a working photocatalyst.

Haselmann et al.43 recently reported
for Pt-loaded TiO2 an early stage deactivation after ultrasound
pretreatment. The fast deactivation (within approximately 1 h of illumination)
was primarily observed for composites with low Pt-loading (Figure 3A). The authors related
the observed deactivation to a “dynamic” interaction
of Pt clusters and/or particles with surface oxygen vacancies. In
fact, the authors observed a change in reaction mechanism as well
as encapsulation of Pt particles presumably by thin TiO2 shells. Such strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) are
frequently reported in heterogeneous catalysis; however, for heterogeneous
photocatalysis, the phenomenon is hardly discussed.43,44 Finally, it is worth noting that Haselmann et al.43 compared low (= deactivating) and high (= nondeactivating)
Pt loading using similar Pt particle size distributions, and Pt leaching
or particle migration and growth were excluded as causes of deactivation.

overall photocatalytic water splitting over Pt-TiO2 systems

Along these lines, in an earlier
study by Arakawa et al.,26 the authors
report that during illumination
of Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts, the Pt was covered with some
titanium hydroxide compounds and speculated that the rate of the back
reaction was efficiently suppressed. As depicted in Figure 3B, the full development of
the active photocatalyst required prolonged illumination, and therefore,
it was easily revealed by standard gas chromatography. For the appearance
of the SMSI effect-related shell, the authors concluded that carbonate
addition to the reaction solution is essential. They also concluded
that carbonates might be actively involved in the formation of oxygen.

Finally, Li et al.45 presented an interesting
approach using Pt or PtOx clusters (approximately
1 nm) loaded on TiO2 nanosheets to facilitate overall water
splitting. Even though some arguments regarding favorable electrochemical
selectivity of the PtOx cocatalyst are
questionable, the surface characterization of the materials prior
to and after photocatalytic experiments are quite interesting and
suggest structural rearrangement of the cocatalysts. While the authors
argued using prolonged testing, density functional theory, and various
characterization techniques that the applied PtOx cocatalyst is stable, distinct differences in the provided
characterization data between as-prepared and tested materials are
visible, such as particle growth (by TEM) and (slight) changes in
the electronic structure of the PtOx particles.
For the Pt modified TiO2 sheets, observed changes are more
severe, and XPS clearly indicates the formation of PtOx species after catalysis. As indicated above, the
formation of surface oxides is feasible by electrochemical or thermal
oxidation. While the data provided by Li et al.,45 did not show transients in gas evolution, the provided
characterization data suggest “dynamic” changes of the
material during illumination, again highlighting the importance of
detailed post-catalysis characterization of the cocatalyst.

Due to its stability (e.g., Pourbaix diagram47) and the well-known performance in HER reaction, Pt is
one of the most frequently applied cocatalyst. Another promising candidate
is composed of Ni and NiOx arranged in
a core–shell like structure. Core–shell systems are
preferred over pure Ni, pure NiOx, and
physical mixtures of Ni and NiOx; in the
early work by Domen et al.,48,49 it was suggested that
Ni/NiOx core–shell particles deposited
on SrTiO3 provide the catalytic sites for hydrogen evolution
(Figure 4). However,
because of the complexity of the cocatalyst system and the properties
of Ni (several feasible oxidation states and feasibility of corrosion),
sufficient evidence of the working state of Ni/NiOx core–shell particles is still missing. Osterloh et
al.50 suggested that a core–shell
model is not representative of the active phase(s). Using surface
voltage spectroscopy, they demonstrated that the metallic Ni cores
function as electron trapping sites and NiOx shells served as hole trapping sites.50 Thus, Ni and NiOx promote formation
of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, making it a dual function cocatalyst.
This assignment of functionalities is in agreement with active states
known form electrochemical water splitting and leads to an appealing
concept in which coloading of water reduction and oxidation catalyst
on the surface of photocatalysts might improve the overall water splitting
efficiency.6,40

More recently, we investigated
the same system, namely, Ni/NiOx-modified
SrTiO3 using a differentially
operated slurry reactor (Figure 4D) and the fast detection mode of a micro-GC equipped
with a pulsed discharge detector (PDD) to investigate the transients
in H2 and O2 evolution in the initial stage
of illumination.38 The PDD detector offers
significant advantages in sensitivity over conventional TCD detectors
(for further information, see ref (51)). Combined with the efficient product separation
in μ-GC, detection of changes in the product evolution
rates on the minute time-scale can be easily achieved. For Ni/NiOx-modified SrTiO3 significant transient
in hydrogen evolution accompanied by a substoichiometric H2:O2 ratio (>2) was observed. Characterization by XPS
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) suggested
that Ni(OH)2 was oxidized to NiOOH. NiOOH is a well-known
OER catalyst, suggesting a promoting effect of oxygen evolution by
NiOOH (Figure 4). Only
after stirring in the dark the required stoichiometric H2:O2 ratio was obtained, and ex-situ characterization suggested
that severe reorganization of the system occurred, as metallic Ni
was embedded in a NiOx matrix. Finally,
Crozier et al.46,52 provided evidence by HRTEM that
deactivation of their composite system was governed by leaching of
metallic Ni resulting in hollow NiOx shells
or oxidation of Ni resulting in the formation of NiOx particles (Figure 4). Evidently, in this system Ni serves as sacrificial reagent
triggering the formation of hydrogen during illumination. In summary,
it is evident that the simple model of static cocatalysts cannot describe
the behavior, either under illumination or in the dark.

Logically,
also for other cocatalyst systems and especially complex
materials like the common Rh/Cr2O3 core–shell
cocatalysts, dynamic rearrangement during initial testing or prolonged
illumination might occur. In fact, chromium oxide/oxyhydroxide films
used in the chlorate process are usually considered as being dynamic
in nature. Here, it is also interesting to note the following: (1)
mixed metal (oxide) cocatalysts show comparable or even higher photocatalytic
performances;4,53,54 (2) Cr2O3 shells are less effective in suppressing
the back reaction of H2 and O2 when applied
on Pt metal particles, suggesting that a simple description of CrOx shells on metallic particles is not sufficient
to describe the cocatalyst material.53,55

Learning from
Other Disciplines
Concerning the purpose of a cocatalyst,
e.g. facilitating redox
reactions at the semiconductor surface, guidelines to the design,
stability, and understanding of active sites can be found in electrocatalysis
(ignoring the semiconductor/electrocatalysts interface). Typically,
in electrocatalysis, activities, and stabilities of an electrocatalyst
are addressed by voltammetry and chronoamperometric/-potentiometric
measurements. Subsequent or even in situ surface characterization
is used to obtain structure–activity relations. Leaching and
corrosion are investigated by determining metal contents in the used
electrolyte. The number of active sites is precisely estimated by
the materials weight, or the number of electrochemically active surface
sites. In fact, certain protocols are established to ensure a practical
description of materials and the reproducibility of the obtained results.56−58 Similar protocols might be required in photocatalysis. For example,
in electrocatalysis, and especially for oxygen evolution, it is known
that pseudostability during long-term testing can be achieved by providing
a sufficient amount of electrocatalytically active material.57 In these cases, corrosion currents might be
significantly smaller than currents generated due to the gas evolving
reaction, and monitoring mass losses or detecting dissolved material
in the electrolyte is a neccesity.57 It
is also known that corrosion of noble metals such as Pt or Ir occurs
during potential cycling, by successive oxidation and reduction of
the surface.59−61 Time scales of corrosion might be different between
electro- and photocatalysis due to different proton/hydroxyl concentrations
of the electrolyte, but a local pH gradient might still facilitate
corrosion. A first indication of materials properties in different
electrolyte conditions can be obtained using Pourbaix diagrams.

Just recently, along with the development of appropriate in situ
techniques, such as high-pressure XPS, changes in the oxidation state
of NiOx and IrO2 OER catalysts
were revealed during electrochemical oxygen evolution.62−65 For example, for Ir-based OER materials, it is commonly observed
that amorphous phases possess higher activities than their crystalline
counterparts: the reasoning behind this observation is still a matter
of speculation. Studying the oxidation state of Ir during OER using
X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopy, Schloegel et al.
were able to determine that (1) metallic Ir converts into a mixed-valence,
conductive iridium oxide matrix, and (2) active sites in amorphous
iridium oxide are likely composed of a weakly bound oxygen, susceptible
to nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, the authors point out that a
dynamic framework is required to allow flexibility in the oxidation
state of Ir, which is required for the formation of oxygen.62,63

Another interesting material known to change oxidation states
during
catalysis is NiOx. The exact nature of
the active site is still under debate. An interesting observation
that needs to be highlighted is that incooperation of Fe-traces into
the NiO-matrix results in dramatically improved OER capabilities.66,67 Similar observations were also reported for Co- and Mn-based materials,
highlighting the importance of contaminants in applied electrolytes.
For photocatalytic systems, a proper understanding of the effect of
metal-traces in electrolytes is even more important as, in contrast
to electrochemical applications, cocatalyst quantities are typically
small, and functional changes by contaminant incorporation will be
expressed more dramatically.

Peculiar observations that might
be of interest can also be found
in electrochemical literature discussing effects of Cr-oxide films
used to obtain electrochemical selectivity.29,30 Generally, Cr-oxide films are reported to increase the electrochemical
selectivity of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, Cr-oxide
films are also reported to influence the activity of hydrogen evolution
catalysts. For example, for Pt@CrOx materials
slightly higher overpotentials are measured for hydrogen evolution
as compared to unprotected Pt. For Au-based materials, however, Cr-oxide
films appear to positively influence the HER performance, suggesting
different functions of the Cr-oxide film depending on the metal substrate.
The effect of Cr-oxide is not yet fully understood in electrochemical
systems; similarly, the basic model of a core covered by a Cr-shell
where the shell solely inhibits the backreaction might underestimate
the role of Cr-oxide in photocatalysis.

As in the field of photocatalysis,
major attention has been paid
to the development of suitable semiconductor materials in photoelectrochemistry.
Indeed, significant progress has been made in understanding and engineering
semiconductor/cocatalyst interfaces.68 For
example, selective charge carrier contacts deposited between semiconductor
and electrocatalyst were shown to dramatically improve the separation
efficiencies and stabilities of PEC photoelectrodes.68,69 A feasible hole storage/extraction layer reported by Li’s
group is MoOx.69 Given that MoOx and CrOx films possess similar charge carrier transport properties,
MoOx and CrOx might serve similar purposes in composite photocatalysts.70,71 However, it will be a major challenge to use selective contacts
on the nanoscale and only locally on semiconductor particles. Nevertheless,
the results obtained in PEC are encouraging and similar approaches
should be followed in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

Another
interesting concept toward improved understanding of semiconductor/cocatalysts
interfaces was presented by Boettcher et al.72 They showed that ion-permeable catalysts such as Co-Pi and NiOOH,
form adaptive Schottky-junctions with the semiconductor surface. Adaptive
junctions change in situ with the oxidation level of the cocatalysts,
leading to improved performances compared with dense cocatalysts.
Given the porous nature of NiOx or chromium
oxide films, for example, the adaptive junction concept will also
be applicable in photocatalysis.

Finally, knowledge developed
in heterogeneous catalysis should
be considered for design of composite catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts
are composed of a support (e.g., an oxide such as silica or alumina)
on which well-dispersed metallic nanoparticles with (ideally) a narrow
size-distribution are deposited. In photocatalysis, however, size
distributions receive relatively little attention, and loading is
solely optimized according to the relationship depicted in Figure 2. Co-catalysts of
different sizes will develop different semiconductor/cocatalyst interfaces,
as recently shown by Takanabe et al.9 Accordingly,
the effectiveness of electron-transfer to the cocatalyst and the shift
of the chemical potential (i.e., the potential required to drive the
redox-reaction) will depend on particle size. For very small particles,
quantum size effects must be considered. Furthermore, stability issues
and transition in oxidation states are likely particle-size-dependent
and are difficult to investigate using a random arrangement of cocatalyst
particles on the surface. One example indicating the feasibility of
creation of particles in a narrow size range was recently reported
by Li et al.73 Well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles
were deposited on solid solutions of GaN:ZnO using atomic layer deposition
(ALD). Remarkably, only 0.13 wt % Pd was required to obtain optimized
functionality of the semiconductor.

Charge transfer and the
subsequent shift of the chemical potential
can be followed using Infrared spectroscopy and carbon monoxide probe
molecules, as recently shown by Domen et al.12 The potential shift is clearly averaged over all metallic particles
deposited, and differences between particles might exist. Still these
results evidence that a better understanding of cocatalysts can be
developed using suitable characterization techniques.

Multicomponent
catalysts are also frequently applied in industrial
heterogeneous catalysis: the different functions of the individual
components cause improved performance and stability, and as depicted
above for photocatalytic water splitting especially, the stability
(see leaching of Ni in the case of Ni/NiO) might be important. In
this respect, it should be mentioned that recently a quaternary system
consisting of Cr- and Mo-oxide together with either Rh or CuOx were applied for POWS showing improved water
splitting behavior and stabilities.71,74

In heterogeneous
catalysis, it is known that as-prepared materials
are converted to the actual active catalyst primarily during the initial
stages of catalytic testing. For example, changes that might occur
are particle sintering and Ostwald ripening,75−77 or even encapsulation
of metallic particles by thin substoichiometric oxides.56 An important parameter in heterogeneous catalysis
is the turnover frequency (TOF), defining the reactivity per exposed
surface site per unit of time. While it is important to note that
the concept of TOF is not applicable to compare different heterogeneous
photocatalysts and a high TOF is not a requirement
for high photocatalytic efficiency, comparing TOFs calculated for
fresh and used photocatalysts will underline changes occurring during
reaction (e.g., by dissolution of the cocatalyst or changes in the
interfacial properties between the cocatalyst and the semiconductor).
In electrocatalysis, TOFs are potential-dependent, and because of
the requirements of photocatalysis, TOF numbers will provide indications
of the generated potentials within the semiconductor and the quality
of the (averaged) semiconductor/cocatalyst interface (considering
a similar dispersion of the cocatalyst). Though the number of surface
active sites on the semiconductor photocatalyst is difficult to define,
advanced characterization methods, such as high-resolution X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy or low-energy ion scattering, allow for a good estimate
(e.g. of the number of available metallic sites for HER). Thus, TOF
numbers (and the required materials characterization) might add additional
fundamental understanding to describe the behavior of heterogeneous
photocatalysts.78,79 Still it is important to report
STH or quantum efficiencies (QE) for comparison of different heterogeneous
photocatalysts. These values should be reported for the individually
optimized system (i.e., optimized photocatalyst amount as well as
optimized cocatalyst loading). For further information about the definition
of these values, the reader is referred to IUPAC conventions and existing
literature.6,80

As depicted by the examples
mentioned above from electrochemistry
and heterogeneous catalysis, using existing knowledge of other disciplines
is beneficial for the development of heterogeneous photocatalyst systems.

Points
for Improvement in Cocatalyst Development
A fair comparison
of photocatalytic activities obtained in different
laboratory’s is complicated by differences in reactor type
and irradiance (light intensities and lamps). Changes in pH and/or
temperature will also significantly influence activities.80 These issues have already been recognized, and
reporting of photocatalytic activities should always include a precise
description of the process parameters and conditions, such as changes
in pH during reaction.

Still it appears to be difficult to reproduce
photocatalytic data
mainly due to the complexity of materials. Common semiconductor materials
are well-characterized, but significant progress is required in the
description and characterization of cocatalysts. Modification of semiconductor
surfaces is nontrivial, and yet it is not known whether conventional
methods such as impregnation or other techniques, such as photodeposition,81 are preferable. Independent of the preparation
techniques, it is important to realize that cocatalysts will likely be in a dynamic state during reaction, and analyzing active sites
during reaction is essential. These dynamics should be revealed
by advanced characterization techniques, preferably in operando conditions.

Furthermore, it should be considered that semiconductor particles
have a heterogeneous surface structure, resulting in various exposed
facets and surface defects. Defects and interfacial energy levels
are regularly discussed in terms of recombination losses occurring
during charge separation and transport; however, the surface heterogeneity
will also result in different semiconductor cocatalyst interfaces,
which will likely cause different (dynamic) states or even result
in nonactive “spectators”. Such spectators on the surface
can even be detrimental and decrease the efficiency of light absorption
by the semiconductor. Besides a few studies, cocatalyst loadings used
in photocatalytic research are relatively large,82,83 and it is arguable that these loadings can be reduced when positioned
at appropriated places/facets on the semiconductor surface.

The required cocatalyst loading is even more important when water
reduction and water oxidation electrocatalysts are simultaneously
applied (coloading) on a single semiconductor surface.84 While coloading might improve charge separation
efficiencies and surface catalysis, the complexity of the system increases
dramatically. Here, it is also of interest to develop suitable strategies
to achieve selective contacts and facilitate the required electron
and hole transfer processes toward the respective cocatalysts.

Non-noble metal-based materials are interesting, alternative cocatalysts.
Generally, non-noble metal materials possess good activities for the
forward H2 evolution reaction, and good electrochemical
selectivity is expected as non-noble metals are usually poor catalysts
to drive thermal recombination of hydrogen and oxygen, or the electrochemical
reduction of oxygen. In these cases the use of complex core–shell
structured materials will be redundant.70,85−87 From PEC studies, it is even known that catalysts such as Mo2C,88 MoSx,88,89 and other transition metal oxides90 are suitable to achieve stable PEC performances.
Most of these non-noble materials possess semiconducting properties,91 which will change the description of the semiconductor/cocatalyst
interface. Unfortunately, from electrocatalysis, it is also known
that non-noble materials usually require higher overpotentials, which
increases the necessary chemical potential of electrons to drive the
redox reaction. Also, higher mass-loadings might be mandatory,19 which in-turn are detrimental in photocatalytic
applications.

The above-mentioned phenomena showcasing the transformation
of
applied cocatalysts are not yet fully understood, and it is worth
emphasizing that additional efforts to develop new cocatalysts and
better understand the behavior of currently applied cocatalysts systems
are required. Understanding is particularly important and crucial
to design of composite heterogeneous photocatalysts that are able
to drive solar-fuel-generating reactions. It appears to be important
to include descriptors and knowledge developed in electrocatalysis,
photoelectrocatalysis, and heterogeneous catalysis including the various
advanced (in situ/operando) characterization techniques that are nowadays
applicable for characterization of developed materials.11,79,86 In this respect, a very recent
study using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates that the
physicochemical state of cocatalysts is significantly affected by
light and surrounding electrolyte, leading to substantial differences
in photocatalytic activity.92

Specifically,
it is suggested to consider the following when using
cocatalysts.

First, cocatalyst development should be guided
by a rational approach
focusing on an effective charge transfer from the semiconductor to
the cocatalyst to facilitate chemical potential shifts. Cleary, random
deposition of cocatalysts should be avoided, and photodeposition could
be a means to selectively deposit metal nanoparticles on the desired
surface locations. Understanding the interfacial phenomena during
photodeposition is also necessary.

Second, optimization of particle
sizes, dispersion, and loading
must be performed individually for every semiconductor composition.
We suggest the optimized cocatalyst system is strongly dependent on
the applied semiconductor.

Third, understanding cocatalyst functionality
requires detailed
characterization. Characterization should be performed before and
after catalytic testing and preferably in situ (see, for example,
recent efforts in electrocatalysis). Detection of ions dissolved in
solution after catalytic testing is indicative of cocatalyst instability.

Fourth, an approach to facilitate better understanding might be
the use of differentially operated reactor systems, in addition to
the conventional recirculating batch reactors. These systems will
allow reliable probing of the stability and activity of photocatalyst
composite materials. Essential information, applicable to the development
of heterogeneous photocatalysts, might be obtained during initial
stages of testing.

It should be noted that
this Perspective primarily
focuses on reactions that are considered to be photosynthetic (e.g.,
thermodynamically unfavorable as compared with photocatalytic which
is usually thermodynamically favored). As recently pointed out by
Osterloh,25 photosynthetic systems are
limited by electrochemical properties (e.g., cocatalysts are dominating
the properties of the system and stability is of importance).
