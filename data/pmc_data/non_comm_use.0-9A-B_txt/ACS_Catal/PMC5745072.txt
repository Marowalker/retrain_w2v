Glucose oxidase has
wide applications in the pharmaceutical, chemical,
and food industries. Many recent studies have enhanced key properties
of this enzyme using directed evolution, yet without being able to
reveal why these mutations are actually beneficial. This work presents
a synergistic combination of experimental and computational methods,
indicating how mutations, even when distant from the active site,
positively affect glucose oxidase catalysis. We have determined the
crystal structures of glucose oxidase mutants containing molecular
oxygen in the active site. The catalytically important His516 residue
has been previously shown to be flexible in the wild-type enzyme.
The molecular dynamics simulations performed in this work allow us
to quantify this floppiness, revealing that His516 exists in two states:
catalytic and noncatalytic. The relative populations of these two
substates are almost identical in the wild-type enzyme, with His516
readily shuffling between them. In the glucose oxidase mutants, on
the other hand, the mutations enrich the catalytic His516 conformation
and reduce the flexibility of this residue, leading to an enhancement
in their catalytic efficiency. This study stresses the benefit of
active site preorganization with respect to enzyme conversion rates
by reducing molecular reorientation needs. We further suggest that
the computational approach based on Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular
dynamics, used in this study, may be a general approach to screening
in silico for improved enzyme variants involving flexible catalytic
residues.

Introduction
Glucose oxidase (GOx)
from Aspergillus niger is a β-d-glucose specific flavoprotein oxidase (EC
1.1.3.4) that efficiently catalyzes substrate conversion to d-glucono-δ-lactone. Due to its diverse potential applications
in the fields of clinical, pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries,
which reach far beyond the glucose biosensors typically used for blood
sugar diagnostics, GOx has gained remarkable economic importance.1 In this respect, flavoprotein oxidases are generally
attractive biocatalysts due to their high regio- and stereoselectivity
and the ability to use molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent.2 Furthermore, increasing the catalytic activity
and stability of enzymes is a persisting necessity for many industrial
applications.

The nondeterministic nature of evolution, both
natural and directed,
provides multiple uphill paths on the fitness landscape of an enzyme;
most pathways, however, lead downhill.3,4 As some enzymes
sacrifice their catalytic power for metabolic control or live under
low evolutionary pressure, the location of a natural enzyme on the
fitness landscape is not necessarily at the global optimum.5,6 Another constraint in enzyme evolution is diminishing returns: as
an enzyme approaches its theoretical limit on the landscape, mutations
keep having smaller additive benefits. The gain in one property often
has a high cost for another (e.g., the apparent stability–activity
tradeoff), and nature usually does not pay the price of complete catalytic
optimization.7,8 GOx was postulated to be an “ideal
enzyme” for biosensors because it fulfills three important
criteria: high specificity, turnover, and stability.9 Although GOx is several orders of magnitude less efficient
than the “perfect enzyme” triosephosphate isomerase,
where the reaction is diffusion limited,5 GOx has a much higher rate constant than other oxidases, leading
to its label “the ‘Ferrari’ of the oxidases”.10 The high efficiency and selectivity
suggest that GOx is a highly-evolved enzyme that lies close to its
catalytic limit. This is supported by several mutagenesis studies
that managed to achieve only marginal improvements of the kinetic
properties of GOx (e.g., up to around 5 times higher kcat or lower KM).11−15 However, despite the quite modest improvements in comparison to
the wild-type enzyme (WT),15 their impact
in relation to the multimillion dollar industry involving applications
of GOx is still important.

In this work, we study several improved
GOx mutants that were recently
derived using a combination of directed evolution and ultrahigh-throughput
screening.15 Since relatively unspectacular
mutations, far from the active site, were responsible for the observed
catalytic enhancement, we aimed to find out the underlying rationale
for their improvement and studied them in more detail. GOx is described
to operate by a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism, where the first step (reductive
half-reaction) involves a concerted proton and hydride transfer from
the anomeric carbon of glucose respectively to His516 and the N5 atom
of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor (Figure 1a).16 Although not directly involved in the reaction mechanism, Glu412
and His559 are thought to act as a buffer for controlling the reactivity
of the active site by maintaining the proper acidity (Figure 1b).16 The protonation state of His516 is crucial for the subsequent oxidative
half-reaction,17 as it leads to increased
oxygen binding and reactivity via stepwise single-electron transfers.10

Figure 1 (a) In the reductive half-reaction, glucose binding is
followed
by concerted proton and hydride transfer from the C1 carbon of glucose
to His516 and FAD, respectively. Electrons are then transferred, in
the oxidative half-reaction, from reduced FAD to oxygen in two single-electron-transfer
steps. (b) The active site of glucose oxidase from A. niger is buried in a pocket, and it is defined
by Glu412, His516, His559, and FAD, which are shown as sticks, together
with glucose, and colored by atom type (gray, C; blue, N; red, O;
white, H; orange, P). The rest of the protein is shown in gray cartoon,
and hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed yellow lines.

The catalytic ability of an enzyme originates mostly
from the stabilization
of the transition state geometry for ligand conversion,18 where binding is based on shape and electrostatic
complementarity.19 There are three main
factors that can lead to suboptimal enzyme kinetics: (1) a slow chemical
step, (2) dissociation of the initial enzyme–substrate encounter
complexes before the advanced enzyme–substrate complex is being
established, and (3) floppiness, that is, the coexistence of multiple
closely related enzyme substates (e.g., multiple side chain rotamers),
of which only some are productive.6,20 Floppiness
increases the ratio of nonproductive to productive substates, leading
to more futile enzyme–substrate encounters, which negatively
affects enzymatic rates, an effect also observed by heating an enzyme.21 Therefore, a preorganized and rigid active site
(i.e., a single substate) leads to the most efficient chemical step.6,22−26 The significance of productive and nonproductive substates in enzyme
ensembles was recently shown, for example, for T4 lysozyme,27 cyclophilin A,28 and
α-esterase 7.29 As a consequence
of this active site preorganization, the relative residue rigidity
has often been found to be higher for the catalytic than for the noncatalytic
amino acids.22 Atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were shown to be a useful method for analyzing the
floppiness of an enzyme and determining how mutations affect the enzyme
substates.30−32 Thus, they nicely complement the analysis of static
crystal structures by also describing the underlying dynamics of the
protein.

The aim of the current work is to understand the catalytic
properties
of GOx by studying several variants with improved catalytic activities
and to create a basis for further improvement of the catalytic efficiency
of this important enzyme. We report the very first crystal structures
for GOx mutants, all bearing a molecule of oxygen in the active site.
In addition to X-ray crystallography, we used MD simulations to corroborate
our conclusions drawn from the crystal structures and to investigate
the effects of the distant GOx mutations on the protein dynamics.
Using Hamiltonian replica exchange MD, we further explored the conformational
ensemble of the active site’s His516 that was previously reported
as flexible in the wild-type enzyme.33,34 Our results
provide structural and dynamic proofs that His516 is indeed flexible
in the WT, where it can flip between catalytic and noncatalytic
conformations, while in the most active mutant, A2, His516
is apparently locked in the catalytically active conformation.

Materials
and Methods
Purification and Deglycosylation
The GOx mutants A2 and F9 (Table 1) were expressed in Pichia pastoris strain KM71H (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After 4 days of fermentation, the supernatant was concentrated
to 20 mL on a Viva Flow 50 system (Sarotius) with a 50 kDa ultrafiltration
membrane. The concentrate was dialyzed against 10 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 6.0) overnight at 4 °C and loaded onto a 20 mL Fast Flow
DEAE Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The protein was purified using
a linear gradient from 10 to 250 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) over
12 column volumes. The GOx peaks were pooled together and concentrated
to 1 mL using 10 kDa ultrafiltration columns. The enzyme solution
was dialyzed against 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) overnight
at 4 °C.

GOx
deglycosylation was performed by incubating the protein solution
with Endo H enzyme (30 U mg–1, NEB) for 20 h at
37 °C. The deglycosylated samples were loaded on a 120 mL Hi
Load Superdex 75 gel filtration column using 10 mM sodium acetate
buffer (pH 5.5) supplemented with 50 mM NaCl. The fractions with GOx
activity were collected and concentrated to 25 mg mL–1 on a 10 kDa ultrafiltration column (Millipore).

GOx Crystallization
The concentrated solution was filtered
through a 0.1 μm centrifugal filter (Millipore), and crystal
growth conditions were screened initially using Hampton Screens I
and II with the vapor diffusion sitting drop method on TAORAD crystallization
plates. The first screening revealed that 1,4-dioxane is suitable
to promote the crystallization of GOx, and optimal conditions were
100 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid,
pH 7.0) in 40% 1,4-dioxane or 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) in 45% 1,4-dioxane.
Crystals were picked from the droplets using cryo-loops and equilibrated
stepwise for several seconds in the crystallization buffer containing
increasing concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG400) or glycerol
in order to cryoprotect the crystal before flash-freezing in a liquid
nitrogen stream at −173 °C. The data sets were collected
in house, using a Bruker FR591 rotating anode X-ray generator and
a Mar345dtb detector.

The collected data were analyzed and processed
using the software iMOSFLM, Pointless and scaled using SCALA, all
belonging to the CCP4 suite.35 In order
to solve structures of the F9 and A2 mutants,
molecular replacement was carried out using the structure of the wild-type
GOx from A. niger (PDB ID: 3QVP).36 All residues mutated in A2 or F9 were replaced by alanine residues in 3QVP for the model generation
using Chainsaw. Molecular replacement was done using Molrep, and final
refinement was carried out by iterative steps of modeling/refinement
cycles with WinCoot37 and Refmac5.35 The Ramachandran plot analysis was performed
with Rampage.38

Molecular Dynamics
Molecular dynamics simulations were
performed for the WT (PDB ID: 1CF3),33P, A2 (PDB ID: 5NIT), and F9 (PDB ID: 5NIW) GOx variants. Two
additional mutants were considered, Pk and Pv, to examine the effect of single mutations on P (Table 1). In the absence
of crystal structures, starting coordinates of the P, Pk, and Pv mutants were obtained by reverting
the corresponding residues in A2 GOx to a rotamer present
in the wild-type enzyme. All structures were simulated in the oxidized
form as holoenzyme (GOx + FAD) in complex with β-d-glucopyranose.
The missing heavy atoms in the A2 and F9 structures were built using MODELER 9.14.39

Glucose was docked into the active site using AutoDock Vina.40 A binding mode positioned on the re face of FAD (Figure 1b) was chosen for further modeling, as this is the most reasonable
mode according to the catalytic mechanism and as it resembles the
previously proposed substrate position.33 In this orientation, the glucose H atom at the anomeric carbon C1
is directed toward the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD,
while the hydroxyl hydrogen from the same glucose carbon is oriented
toward His516 and His559.

The β-d-glucopyranose
and FAD topologies were created
using ACPYPE41 and Antechamber.42 The glucose structure was optimized with Gaussian
0943 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory,
followed by the calculation of restrained electrostatic potential
(RESP) charges at the HF/6-31G* level. The FAD charges were obtained
from Todde et al.44

MD simulations
were performed using the GROMACS 4.6.7 suite,45 with the Amber 99SB-ILDN force field46 and TIP3P explicit water.47 Hydrogen
atoms were added, and the protonation states of
all titratable residues were assigned on the basis of a PROPKA 3.1
analysis48 corresponding to a pH of 5.5,
which is optimal for GOx activity. A disulfide bridge was defined
between the Cys164 and Cys206 side chains. The protein was centered
in a truncated octahedral box, at least 10 Å away from each of
the box edges, and solvated with around 22000 water molecules. The
net charge of the system was neutralized with sodium ions. The system
was minimized in two stages: an initial minimization with steepest
descent (maximum force of 500 kJ mol–1 nm–1), followed by a minimization with the conjugate gradient algorithm
(maximum force of 100 kJ mol–1 nm–1).

Periodic boundary conditions were applied, and electrostatic
interactions
were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method.49 The cutoff distance for the short-range nonbonded interactions
was 12 Å. An integration step of 2.0 fs was used, and bonds were
constrained with the LINCS algorithm.50 The minimized system was gradually heated and equilibrated at 25
°C for 100 ps in the NVT ensemble with the protein and ligands
restrained using a positional restraint force constant of 1000 kJ
mol–1 nm–2. Following the equilibration
under a constant volume, two stages of NpT equilibration were carried
out. In the first phase, a 2 ns equilibration was performed with restraints
on the protein and ligands. A second, 8 ns equilibration followed,
with restrained protein backbone and FAD motion while glucose was
free to move.

Production MD simulations were carried in the
NpT ensemble for
100 ns (three independent simulations were performed for each GOx
variant), collecting coordinates of the system every 20 ps. The modified
Berendsen (v-rescale) thermostat51 and
the Parrinello–Rahman barostat52 were employed. The production MD sampling time accumulated over
all GOx variants amounted to 1.8 μs.

Hamiltonian Replica Exchange
MD
The Hamiltonian replica
exchange MD (HREX-MD) simulations were performed using GROMACS 4.6.7
in combination with the Plumed 2.1 plugin,53 as implemented by Bussi.54 The same conditions
were applied as in the standard MD simulations. Four replicas were
simulated for each GOx variant, where only the energy terms (i.e.,
the Hamiltonian) affecting His516 were scaled. The Hamiltonian scaling
factors were exponentially distributed between 1.00 and 0.67 (exact
scaling factors were 1.000, 0.874, 0.763, and 0.667), which corresponds
to temperatures between 25 and 174 °C. The exchange of replicas
was attempted every 4 ps during the 50 ns simulations. The exchange
acceptance ratio was 30–70% in all HREX-MD simulations; only
the Pv variant had an exchange rate of ∼15%. The
sampling time accumulated over all HREX-MD simulations was 1.2 μs.
Structures sampled for the HREX-MD simulation with the unperturbed
Hamiltonian were used for the analysis.

Umbrella Sampling MD
The umbrella sampling (US-MD)
simulations were performed using GROMACS 5.1.2 in combination with
the Plumed 2.2 plugin. The same conditions were applied as in the
previous MD simulations. The sampling was performed for the varying
χ2 dihedral of His516 in the range of 25–235°,
over 26 windows; exact χ2 restraining values are
shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
The χ1 dihedral was restrained to 285° with
a weak force of 50 kJ mol–1 rad–1 to keep this angle in the g– geometry.
Each window was simulated for 50 ns. Dihedral angles were written
every 0.5 ps, and the first 5 ns was discarded for the potential of
mean force (PMF) calculations. The PMF was examined for the WT and A2 GOx, amounting to 2.6 μs US-MD
sampling time. The PMF was calculated using the weighted histogram
analysis method (WHAM),55 where the error
was estimated using the blocking procedure.56 Briefly, each window from a US-MD simulation was split into 10 segments
(i.e., blocks) of increasing length, ranging from 1 ns for the shortest
block up to the full 45 ns per window for the longest block. The PMF
was calculated for each block, and all PMFs were aligned to the final
point at χ2 = 235°. The blocked standard error
was calculated for each window using data from all 10 blocks.

Data Analysis
GROMACS tools, VMD 1.9.157 and MATLAB
R2015b were used for the trajectory analysis.
The dynamic cross-correlated motion analysis was performed in R 3.2.5
using the Bio3D package.58 The active site
volumes were calculated with POVME.59 PyMOL60 and Chimera61 were
used for figure rendering.

Results and Discussion
Crystallization
and Structure Determination
In previous
work,15 several GOx mutants with improved
activity and stability were identified. The A2 mutant
shows the highest catalytic activity, while the mutant F9 has the highest thermal stability. The first crystallization experiments
were carried out using glycosylated GOx expressed in P. pastoris. Hampton Screens I and II were tested,
but no promising crystallization conditions were found. Deglycosylation
has been previously shown to be important for crystallization,62 as the process of crystallization demands highly
uniform macromolecules. The glycosylation in P. pastoris is characterized by a uniform N-acetylglucosamine
(NAG) core glycosylation with NAG-β(1,4)-NAG, followed by a
heterogeneous glycosylation of a high mannose (β-d-mannose,
BMA) content.63 In order to obtain uniform
GOx molecules, the carbohydrate moieties were removed by enzymatic
hydrolysis using glycosidases.

The crystallization experiments
with the deglycosylated GOx were successful for the A2 and F9 GOx variants. The first screening using Hampton
Screens I and II revealed that 1,4-dioxane is suitable to promote
the crystallization of GOx. Further fine screening with different
buffers, pHs, and 1,4-dioxane concentrations indicated that the crystallization
works best using 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) in 40% 1,4-dioxane or 100 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5) in 45% 1,4-dioxane. Regarding incompatibilities of
classic crystallization plates, vapor diffusion crystallization was
performed using TAORAD crystallization plates in their sitting drop
configuration. The A2 and F9 GOx crystals
grew in the form of long thick needles and showed an intense yellow
color. The crystal growth took three to 5 days at room temperature
and yielded crystals in the P3221 space group (Table 2). The cell content analysis gave a probability of 0.99 that one
molecule is present per asymmetric unit with a water content of 57%.

The N-linked Asn glycosylation is
related to specific
motifs, i.e., Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, where X can be any amino acid
except Pro.64 Eight possible glycosylation
sites (Asn43, Asn89, Asn161, Asn168, Asn258, Asn355, Asn388, and Asn473)
are present in the GOx sequence. In the crystal structures, GOx was
Asn-glycosylated at all sites, except Asn43. Interpretable electron
density was observed for mutant A2 at four sites (89,
161, 355, and 388) and in mutant F9 at six sites (89,
161, 258, 355, 388, and 473), whereas the two additional sites showed
a less pronounced electron density. In most cases, a single NAG moiety
remained at each of these positions, while the deglycosylation removed
the other initially present carbohydrates. At Asn89, the electron
density indicates the presence of the core glycosylation, Asn89-NAG-NAG-BMA,
which was not pruned by Endo H due to steric hindrance. Asn89 is located
at the homodimeric interface of the GOx dimer, and BMA-rich glycosylation
protrudes out of the dimer cleft. As the glycosylation is involved
in the intermolecular interactions, it promotes the dimer state.

The cocrystallization approaches with d-glucose and d-glucal did not yield crystals. Soaking experiments were also
unsuccessful and caused crystal degradation or did not yield visible
ligand electron densities.

Protein Flexibility and Dynamics
To test the influence
of the mutations on the protein dynamics, we performed MD simulations
of several GOx variants. Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information, which shows the root-mean-square deviation
of the protein backbone motion, indicates that the WT and GOx mutants are stable during the 100 ns trajectories. A more
detailed analysis of the enzyme dynamics reveals that the laboratory
evolution of GOx led to a slight decrease in residue flexibility,
especially in the active site region. This can be inferred from the
associated standard deviations reflecting the change of the active
site volumes (Table 3). Namely, the A2 mutant has a much smaller deviation
than the WT enzyme, indicating a less flexible active
site in A2. On the other hand, the residual root-mean-square
fluctuations (Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information) reveal a notable destabilization of the β-sheet D (residues 77–81, 93–97, 434–438, and
448–451) in the glucose binding domain of all mutants, which
is caused by the I94V mutation lying at this β-sheet (Figure 2a). This mutation
is present in all mutants, including the parent P. The F9 variant is much less flexible than the other tested mutants,
which has a positive effect on its thermostability but makes the enzyme
less efficient than P (Table 3). These results are in agreement with Fraser
et al., who suggested that, although mutations should be directed
toward a more rigid active site, second-shell residues should be flexible
to ensure the efficiency of the numerous steps involved in catalysis.65

by sticks and colored by atom type (see Figure 1 for the color code). (b) Dynamic cross-correlation
maps (DCCMs) of the WT GOx (top half) and the A2 mutant (bottom half). The most discriminating regions are indicated

Per-residue count of the correlated and anticorrelated motions (based

blue, respectively. The positions of the mutations are represented
with × and that of His516 with ★. The count plots for
all variants are given in Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information.

Another aspect of enzyme dynamics is the correlated nature
of residue
motion that facilitates many biochemical processes.66 Anticorrelated motions were previously related to enhanced
catalysis in several enzymes.67,68 While we observe a
general increase in both correlated and anticorrelated motions over
the course of the GOx evolution (Figure 2b,c and Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information), anticorrelated motions are
particularly discriminating among the studied GOx mutants and the WT. Starting from the parent mutant P, the aforementioned
I94V on β-sheet D, together with the T30V mutation
located at helix H1, which is close to the phosphate groups of FAD,
plays a very important role for anticorrelated motions in GOx. Namely,
the motions of β-sheet D and α-helix H6 are anticorrelated
to the motions of β-sheet C (glucose binding domain) and α-helices H1 (FAD binding domain) and H12, which extends
to the active site’s His516 (Figure 2a). This kind of ordered motion is, to a
varying degree, visible in all variants. The R537K mutation, although
located on the surface, has a positive influence on the magnitude
of both correlated and anticorrelated motions in the Pk and A2 variants (Figures S3 and S4). It further strengthens the anticorrelated motions already
observed in the P mutant, while its effects on the correlated
motions are especially high for the β-sheet C of the glucose
binding domain (residues 211–213, 330–338, 347–353,
409–416, 420–427, and 484–489). From the Pv, A2, and F9 variants it can be
seen that the M556V mutation, which is close to the active site, exhibits
a positive effect on the anticorrelated and, even more, on the correlated
motions of the same region as influenced by R537K (i.e., the β-sheet
C; see Figures S3 and S4).

In the
pentamutant A2, the mutations work together
to considerably enhance both correlated and anticorrelated motions,
as shown in Figure 2b,c. A principal component analysis of the fluctuations of the pairwise
distances between the residues performing highly anticorrelated motions
in A2 indicates that such motions contribute to the creation
of a tighter active site in this variant (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), which increases the probabilities
of the contacts that directly stabilize the substrate in the proper
position for the reaction to take place. This leads to the optimal
orientation of the reactive atoms, which enhances catalysis and also
lowers the KM value 1.5-fold. It should
be noted that the nature of glucose binding by the WT and mutant GOx does not change, as the same residues are always
involved (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).
However, this figure also shows that the mutations changed the priorities
of certain residues in stabilizing the substrate in the active site.

His516 Conformational Ensemble in GOx Crystals
The
structures of A2 (PDB ID: 5NIT) and F9 (PDB ID: 5NIW) are similar to
those of the wild-type GOx. Major differences in these structures
exist only at the active site. For the first time, we see an important
electron density situated between His516 and FAD and interpret it
as a molecule of oxygen (Figure 3). A water molecule, present in all A. niger GOx structures apart from 1GAL, bridges the Nε
of His516 and the N5 atom of FAD (HOH1000 in A2) and
is between 2.74 and 2.89 Å distant from His516.

Figure 3 Structural view of the
FAD re face of the A2 mutant, showing
the catalytically important His516 and
His559 residues. A water molecule (HOH1000) interacts with His516
and is oriented toward the N5 nitrogen of FAD. An oxygen molecule
(OXY777) is well centered with respect to His516. The electron density
is shown as a cyan mesh, and important distances (in Å) are indicated
by black dashed lines.

In all of the structures from A. niger, the side chain of His516 populates the broadly defined (g–, Nt) rotamer with
dihedral angles 240° < χ1< 360° and
150° < χ2 < 210° (Table 4). In the 1CF3 structure, where
the His516 side chain deviates the most from the center of the (g–, Nt) rotamer population,
the water molecule in the active site follows the His516 motion toward
the tip of the oxygen molecule that is present in the A2 and F9 structures (Figure 4). Apart from movements within the (g–, Nt) rotamer observed
in the wild-type A. niger structures, the (g–, Ng+) rotamer (240° < χ1< 360° and 30° < χ2< 90°)
is structurally documented in GOx of Penicillium amagasakiense (PDB ID: 1GPE,33Table 4), where a water molecule is bridging His520 and His563,
which are equivalent to His516 and His559, respectively, in GOx of A. niger. The (g–, Nt) rotamer of His516 is the
geometry necessary for the proton transfer from glucose to occur and
will be therefore denoted catalytic conformation.
The same conformation of this conserved residue can be observed in
many members of the superfamily, e.g., in aryl-alcohol oxidase,69 cholesterol oxidase,70 and cellobiose dehydrogenase,71 and in
a recently crystallized glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from Aspergillus flavus (35% sequence identity with A. niger GOx).72 GDH is oxygen-independent, yet it preserves
the catalytic conformation in the unliganded state (PDB ID: 4YNT) and with gluconolactone
(PDB ID: 4YNU) in the active site. QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics)
calculations confirm that this conformation is the one present during
catalysis in aryl-alcohol oxidase.73 In
the (g–, Ng+) conformation, His516 has moved away from the substrate,
making the active site geometrically and chemically unsuitable for
the concerted proton and hydride transfer (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Thus, this conformation
is called noncatalytic henceforth.

the electron density of the oxygen molecule
(cyan mesh) as well as the remaining positive electron density (green).
Aligned to the His516 side chain of F9 (colored by atom
type), one can see the side chains of A. niger wild-type structures 3QVP (orange) and 1CF3 (magenta). Also shown are the oxygen
atoms of the corresponding water molecules that are equivalent to
HOH1000 in F9.

The conformation of His516 in the A2 and F9 structures is similar to those in A. niger GOx structures with PDB codes 3QVP and 3QVR. While the His516
conformation of 3QVR
is almost identical with that in A2 and F9, that of 3QVP is slightly shifted toward the conformations found in the 1CF3 and 1GAL structures (Figure 4). The structures 3QVP and 3QVR resulted from an
attempt to investigate the oxygen-binding site using chloride ions
as oxygen substitutes,36 a method postulated
to be an alternative to the approach using xenon for the identification
of potential oxygen-binding sites. However, despite the similarity
of conformations adopted by His516 to those in A2 and F9, no oxygen was reported in 3QVP and 3QVR. Instead, a water molecule was placed
at the position occupied by the center of the oxygen molecule in A2 and F9.

In order to further investigate
the active site, the electron densities
of five wild-type GOx structures (1GAL, 1CF3, 3QVP, 3QVR, and 1GPE) were re-examined using structure factors
from the PDB database. All structures show at least some positive
and/or negative electron density near His516 (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). The angular displacement
of His516 from the conformation observed in the A2 mutant
inversely follows the quality of the electron density around this
residue and ends up with a partially missing electron density for
the most deviating (g–, Nt) structures (1CF3 and 1GAL). This last observation was at the origin to indicate that the His516
side chain is flexible.33,34 A pH-induced conformational
flexibility due to a different protonation state of His516 can be
excluded, since crystals of the A2 and F9 mutants were grown at pH 7.0–7.5 and those of the 3QVP and 3QVR structures at pH
6.9 and 5.1, respectively, whereas crystals for the 1CF3 structure were obtained
at an intermediate pH of 5.6. The 3QVR structure, with its His516 conformation
closest to that observed in A2, shows only minor positive
electron density on both sides of the water molecule, which was placed
at the site of oxygen in A2, and may indicate the presence
of oxygen already in this structure.

An interesting observation
is the well-positioned oxygen in A2 and F9 with respect to the π-orbital
system of His516 (Figure 3). As the oxygen reduction is spin forbidden by the triplet
nature of molecular oxygen, a catalytic effect for the triplet–singlet
transition might rely on the orbital coupling between oxygen and His516.
Since the crystallographic electron density represents a mean observation
of the conformational substates adopted by a protein and considering
that the most active mutant A2 shows neither positive
nor negative electron density around His516, its conformation can
be seen as very well defined, corresponding to a pure catalytic conformer
of His516. A more dynamic situation is observed for the F9 mutant, which mainly adopts the catalytic conformation as in A2. However, modest positive electron densities at the active
site of F9 GOx indicate that the His516, with its water
molecule, also samples small amounts of the displaced (g–, Nt) conformation observed in
the 1CF3 structure
(Figure 4).

His516
Conformational Dynamics from Simulations
In
order to quantify the flexibility of the side chain of His516, we
performed standard and enhanced MD simulations. Our initial MD simulations
of A. niger wild-type
GOx showed that χ1 is conserved to g– geometry (240–360°; Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). The χ2 dihedral samples two minima, Ng+ (30–90°) and Nt (150°–210°),
neither of which corresponds to the most stable conformation in the
His rotamer library. However, the noncatalytic (g–, Ng+) geometry is
4 times more probable in the backbone-independent rotamer library
than the catalytic (g–, Nt) conformation.74 In WT, His516 is free to flip to a small cavity located in the
vicinity of the active site. The M556V mutation in A2, which resides at the border of this cavity, significantly decreases
the cavity size, making His516 sterically hindered (Figure 5). It is important to note
that valine is the most common residue found at this position in the
consensus of glucose oxidase sequences.15

Figure 5 Cavity
(light blue mesh) located in the vicinity of the active
site (yellow surface) of (a) WT GOx and (b) A2 mutant. The M556V mutation returns this residue to its consensus
sequence, which significantly decreases the cavity size preventing
His516 flipping.

The subsequent Hamiltonian
replica exchange MD simulations, performed
to quantify the flexibility of the His516 side chain, revealed that
the g– geometry is
indeed dominant in all GOx variants. In WT, the catalytic
(Nt) and noncatalytic (Ng+) conformations are quite equally distributed (Figure 6). The P mutant introduces a
clear separation between the two conformations while simultaneously
enriching the catalytic form, and R537K and M556V further reduce the
noncatalytic geometry. The synergy of these effects conserves His516
mostly in the catalytic conformation in A2, increasing kcat 2.6 times and its efficiency 4-fold in comparison
to that in WT. The F9 mutant bears the M556V
mutation and, therefore, resembles the Pv variant, where
the catalytic conformation is energetically more favorable. However,
the absence of R537K and the addition of two other mutations (R37K/V106I)
narrows the separation between the two conformations, making it more
similar to WT. This indicates a lower energy barrier
for the transition between the catalytic and noncatalytic states and,
hence, slower catalysis than for the A2 mutant (increase
in kcat 1.8 times and in efficiency 2.6
times in comparison to WT).

Figure 6 His516 side chain dihedral
angles (χ1 and χ2) distribution:
(a) WT GOx, (b) parent mutant P, (c) Pk, (d) Pv, (e) A2, and (f) F9. The χ1 dihedral has a
clear preference for g– geometry.
The χ2 dihedral prefers either the catalytic Nt or noncatalytic Ng+ geometries
in the different GOx variants. The normalized integrated distributions
are shown as red curves on either side of the panels.

To properly quantify the energy barrier between
the catalytic and
noncatalytic His516 states, we performed umbrella sampling MD simulations
of the WT and A2 variants in χ2 space. The global minimum of WT is at 60°
(Ng+), and it is only 0.2 kcal mol–1 more stable than the minimum at 160° (Nt), which corresponds to an equilibrium mixture of 60:40
of noncatalytic to catalytic conformations at room temperature (Figure 7). Furthermore, having
a rather high energy barrier of 2.9 kcal mol–1 for
the Ng+ to Nt transition
means that a significant amount of time is lost on making GOx conformationally
fit for catalysis, indicating that WT GOx is not an optimal
catalyst. In A2, on the other hand, the catalytic conformation
is 30 times more probable, as it is 2.0 kcal mol–1 more stable than the noncatalytic form. Furthermore, the energy
barrier for the conversion of the noncatalytic to the catalytic state
is significantly lower (1.8 kcal mol–1) than for WT. Thus, the catalytic conformation can be achieved much
more easily than for WT while the transformation back
to the Ng+ conformation is slow due to
the barrier of 3.8 kcal mol–1.

around the χ2 dihedral
angle of His516: (red) WT GOx; (blue) A2 mutant. The shaded areas around the free energy profiles represent
the errors estimated using the blocking procedure.

The extensive US-MD simulations corroborate the
relative energies
of the minima determined from the HREX-MD simulations. Umbrella sampling,
however, performs better in estimating barrier heights. On the other
hand, HREX-MD is a very convenient and cost-effective technique and
can thus represent an excellent screening method for identifying good
enzyme designs that involve potentially flexible active site residues.
Furthermore, it is fast enough to be used for guiding directed evolution
experiments.

Conclusions
Glucose oxidase is an
important industrial catalyst for which many
mutations were proposed to enhance various properties. However, not
much is known about the mode of action of these mutations. In order
to fill this gap, we solved the first crystal structures of GOx mutants
from A. niger and
performed an extensive molecular dynamics investigation based on a
total of 5.6 μs simulation time to correlate mutations with
kinetic data. The crystal structures of the mutants A2 and F9 revealed molecular oxygen to be present at the
active site and suggest that the side chain of His516, which is of
utmost importance for the enzymatic reaction, is preorganized in the
catalytic conformation and less flexible than in the wild-type GOx.

In the MD simulations, the most active mutant (A2)
shows significant anticorrelated motions between secondary structure
elements caused by the T30V and I94V mutations and both correlated
and anticorrelated motions resulting from the R537K and M556V mutations.
This long-range dynamic effect reduces the volume of the active site,
which has a positive influence on catalytic efficiency. From all GOx
variants studied here, A2 possesses the tightest and
least floppy active site, where protein contacts stabilize the optimal
geometry of glucose for its interconversion to gluconolactone. Our
MD simulations thus confirm the observation from the crystal structures
that His516 is flexible in the WT and more rigid in the
mutants. Furthermore, we find that His516 can flip between the two
substates, catalytic and noncatalytic. To study the relative populations
of the two substates and barriers between them, we employed Hamiltonian
replica exchange and umbrella sampling MD simulations. While both
substates are equally populated in the WT enzyme, the
most favorable conformation of His516 in the A2 mutant
is the catalytic form. This results from the M556V mutation that reduces
the size of a cavity in the vicinity of the active site and therefore
restrains the movements of His516. As the turnover number of the discussed
GOx variants is already very high (and probably very close to the
theoretical limit), further design should be directed toward mutations
that could provide higher binding affinities for glucose: mutations
either in the first shells around the active site or at further positions
(e.g., at the protein surface) that could positively modulate the
correlated and anticorrelated motions.

From our study, we find
that US-MD performs much better in estimating
barrier heights, but both US-MD and HREX-MD are equally good for predicting
positions and relative populations of the enzyme substates. Considering
the relatively low computational cost and ease of use of HREX-MD simulations,
we conclude that this method represents an attractive tool for in
silico screening of enzyme variants involving flexible residues in
the active sites.
