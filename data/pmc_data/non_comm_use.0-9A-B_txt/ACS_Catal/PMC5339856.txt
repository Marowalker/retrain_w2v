The
direct introduction of the valuable SCF3 moiety into organic
molecules has received considerable attention. While it can be achieved
successfully for aryl chlorides under catalysis with Ni0(cod)2 and dppf, this report investigates the Ni-catalyzed
functionalization of the seemingly more reactive aryl halides ArI
and ArBr. Counterintuitively, the observed conversion triggered by
dppf/Ni0 is ArCl > ArBr > ArI, at odds with bond
strength preferences. By a combined computational and experimental
approach, the origin of this was identified to be due to the formation
of (dppf)NiI, which favors β-F elimination as a competing
pathway over the productive cross-coupling, ultimately generating
the inactive complex (dppf)Ni(SCF2) as a catalysis dead
end. The complexes (dppf)NiI–Br and (dppf)NiI–I were isolated and resolved by X-ray crystallography.
Their formation was found to be consistent with a ligand-exchange-induced
comproportionation mechanism. In stark contrast to these phosphine-derived
Ni complexes, the corresponding nitrogen-ligand-derived species were found to be likely competent catalysts
in oxidation state I. Our computational studies of N-ligand derived
NiI complexes fully support productive NiI/NiIII catalysis, as the competing β-F elimination is disfavored.
Moreover, N-derived NiI complexes are predicted to be more
reactive than their Ni0 counterparts in catalysis. These
data showcase fundamentally different roles of NiI in carbon–heteroatom
bond formation depending on the ligand sphere.

Introduction
The past decade has
seen numerous impressive advances in the area of homogeneous nickel
catalysis.1 The limits of the oxidative
addition step have continuously been pushed back to some of the least
activated bonds, such as the recent breakthrough of aryl ether functionalizations,
for example.2,3 In addition, nickel catalysis
features a rich mechanistic portfolio, which ranges from the ability
to more readily interchange among oxidation states 0, I, II, and III
to the possibility for electron transfer processes (Figure 1) in cross-coupling.4 While capitalization on these diverse mechanistic
possibilities has allowed the development of rich and novel synthetic
organic chemistry in recent years, the very same mechanistic diversity
also poses challenges in achieving the desired key features of modern
and sustainable catalytic transformation: e.g. efficiency, low catalyst
loading, recyclability, catalyst robustness, generality in substrate,
and high functional group tolerance. To achieve high efficiency and
generality, catalyst deactivation processes and side reactions will
need to be overcome. This in turn requires a fundamental understanding
of their origins. In this context, the role and potential catalytic
competence of the odd oxidation state I has been questioned.5,6

Figure 1 Key
features and challenges of Ni catalysis.

Interestingly, while NiI species derived from
N ligands have been postulated as catalytically competent intermediates
in alkyl–alkyl couplings, e.g. in recent photoredox applications
as well as in cross-coupling reactions of challenging electrophiles,6 for phosphine-ligand-derived NiI complexes,
there are limited mechanistic data available. The latter complexes
have been observed in reactions that employed Ni0 as catalyst
but suggested to be catalytically inactive7,8 or
reported to be less active than Ni0.9 On the other hand, Martin recently presented detailed mechanistic
data supporting NiI as an active species in the activation
of C–OMe bonds.10 Matsubara11a and Louie11b observed
activities in Kumada and Suzuki couplings with NHC-bound NiI complexes. To shine a light on these contrasting observations, we
undertook a combined computational and experimental study of the nickel-catalyzed
trifluoromethylthiolation reactions of aryl halides as a case study.

Access to ArSCF3 compounds is of pharmaceutical and
agrochemical significance due to their associated advantageous lipophilicity
properties.12 Direct catalytic access is
of particular interest.13,14 Aryl iodides and bromides
can be converted to ArSCF3 via Pd0 15 and PdI–PdI catalysis
with (Me4N)SCF3 or alternative nucleophilic
SCF3 sources.16 In the context
of Ni catalysis, Vicic has shown that a Ni(cod)2/bipyridine17 system allows for functionalization of aryl
iodides and selected bromides, but not aryl chlorides. These in turn
can be transformed with a phosphine-based catalyst system, Ni(cod)2/dppf, that forms [(dppf)Ni0(cod)] in situ.7,18

In this report, we will show that [(dppf)Ni0(cod)],
in contrast to a bipyridine-derived Ni catalyst, counterintuitively
leads to much lower conversions for those aryl halides that have weaker
bonds: i.e., aryl iodides and bromides. We will unravel this reactivity
behavior herein, unambiguously assigning the role of NiI for P- vs N-derived ligands in trifluoromethylthiolation, and uncover
the pathways of their origins.

Results and Discussion
We started
our investigations with the systematic comparison of the efficiency
of C–SCF3 bond formation of 4-methoxy-substituted
aryl halides in toluene at 45 °C with (Me4N)SCF3 under Ni(cod)2/dppf (10 mol %) catalysis conditions.
While 4-chloroanisole was converted to the corresponding ArSCF3 in 52% yield, the generally more reactive aryl bromide gave
only a 24% yield and the corresponding iodide as little as 16% of
the trifluoromethylthiolated product (see Figure 2). These reactivities are at odds with the
expected intrinsic ease of the aryl halides toward oxidative addition
by a [Ni0] catalyst, as reinforced by the computed activation
barriers of oxidative addition (see Figure 2). Our calculations at the M06L level of
theory19 showed that the barrier to oxidatively
add an aryl iodide to [(dppf)Ni0(cod)] is 7 kcal/mol lower
in energy than that of the seemingly more reactive aryl chloride.

Figure 2 Observed
reactivity order (C–Cl > C–Br > C–I) in
the dppf/Ni0(cod)2-catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation,
at odds with the computed barriers.

To assess the inherent preference for C–SCF3 bond formation in greater detail, we subsequently undertook intra- and intermolecular competition experiments
(C–I vs C–Cl), with Figure 2 presenting the results. While the selectivity
followed the expected ease of oxidative addition, showing exclusive
functionalization of the C–I site, the overall conversion to
product was low (5% for intramolecular and 22% for intermolecular
competition). Thus, the lower yields obtained in the reactions with
the weaker C–halogen bond substrates do not correlate with
the intrinsic reactivities toward oxidative addition but instead must
arise from alternative factors that render the catalysis nonproductive.

To gain deeper insight, we performed 19F and 31P NMR spectroscopic analyses of the reaction mixtures after 15 h.
These indicated that the characteristic signals of [(dppf)Ni0(cod)] had disappeared, and instead a new species had formed that
gives two triplets in the 31P NMR (resonating at 30.8 ppm
(J = 23.0 Hz) and at 22.1 ppm (J = 37.6 Hz)) and a dd in the 19F NMR spectrum (at −44.8
ppm (J = 37.6, 23.0 Hz)). While we had observed this
species also in our previous studies,20 we had not previously been able to assign its structure or explain
its origin. However, we now succeeded in the isolation and characterization
of single crystals, unambiguously confirming that the thiocarbonyl-bound
[Ni0] complex 1 was formed (Figure 3). Attempts to react ArI, ArBr,
and ArCl with (Me4N)SCF3 and complex 1 showed no reaction, suggesting that 1 was catalytically
inactive and therefore a product of catalyst deactivation.20 Computational analysis further indicates that
the S=CF2 ligand is very strongly bound to the Ni
center—ligand exchange with 1,5-cyclooctadiene is predicted
to be endothermic by 21.3 kcal/mol.19

Figure 3 Deactivation
of Ni0 to 1 occurring under catalytic conditions.

Species 1 could in
principle arise from the trapping of a potential decomposition side
product (F2C=S) of the employed (Me4N)SCF3 reagent by the [Ni0] catalyst.21 However, our separate subjection of (Me4N)SCF3 to Ni(cod)2/dppf at 45 °C indicated that
this would be unlikely, as 1 was not formed. Moreover,
there was no indication of the formation of F2C=S
in solution, as judged by 19F NMR analysis. Instead, 1 is likely derived directly from an alternative Ni intermediate.

Given the formal loss of a fluorine atom, a β-fluoride elimination
step is mechanistically required. Literature precedence suggests that
β-fluoride elimination from [NiII] intermediates
would be feasible.22 Thus, to gain insight
whether the likely origin of 1 is a [NiII]
or an alternative Ni species, we computationally investigated the
ease of β-F elimination from [(dppf)NiII(SCF3)(Ph)] relative to the productive reductive elimination pathway
(Figure 4). Our data,
obtained at the CPCM(toluene)M06/def2TZVP//ωB97XD/6-31G(d)(SDD)
level of theory suggests β-F elimination is disfavored by ΔΔG⧧ = 7.5 kcal/mol.23

Figure 4 Computational comparison of β-F elimination and reductive
elimination pathways from NiII. Shown are the ΔΔG⧧ values in kcal/mol, calculated at the
CPCM(toluene)M06/def2TZVP//ωB97XD/6-31G(d)(SDD) level of theory.23

In line with these calculations are the following experimental
observations: while subjection of the product ArSCF3 to
Ni(cod)2/dppf will eventually give rise to the deactivation
complex 1, this process occurs on a slower time scale
in comparison to that observed for the forward reactions.24 Moreover, given the higher propensity for subsequent
oxidative addition of the liberated [Ni0] to either ArI
or ArBr (in comparison to ArCl) upon reductive elimination of ArSCF3 under catalysis conditions, the unproductive reverse reaction
with the product, ArSCF3, can also be ruled out as the
predominant cause of the catalysis dead end 1 for the
weaker versus stronger C–halogen bond electrophiles.25

We speculated that the initial oxidative
addition step may be the cause of the divergent reactivities. Thus,
we subsequently monitored the oxidative addition of [(dppf)Ni0(cod)] to ArI, ArBr, and ArCl in the absence of (Me4N)SCF3. We observed that in all cases a paramagnetic species
was formed, which we could unambiguously assign as [NiI] upon X-ray crystallographic analyses. While the oxidative addition
to ArCl7 and ArBr give the tricoordinate
monomer [(dppf)NiI-X], interestingly, for the iodide, a
dimer is the favored species in the solid state (see Figure 4).26,27 The observed relative ease of the formation of [NiI]
follows the order ArI > ArBr > ArCl.

These data are in
line with the pioneering and seminal studies by Kochi on the oxidative
addition of Ni0(PEt3)4 to aryl halides.28 Kochi proposed an electron transfer mechanism
as origin of [NiI]. However, we detected the formation
of biaryl products in all cases, suggesting that a different mechanism
for the formation of [NiI] may be operative. As an alternative
for the electron transfer mechanism there have been reports on [NiI] formation via ligand exchanges on a [NiII] intermediate.11

As illustrated in Figure 5, following the oxidative addition of [Ni0] to ArX, ligand exchange from [(dppf)NiII(X)(Ph)]
to [(dppf)NiII(X)2] and [(dppf)NiII(Ph)2] may likely occur, followed by reductive elimination
of biaryl from [NiII] and subsequent comproportionation
of the resulting [Ni0] with [NiII] (see Figure 5).29 The formation of [(dppf)NiIIX2] as
an intermediate was also unambiguously confirmed through its isolation
(in addition to NiI) and characterization (via 1H NMR and X-ray crystallography) from the reaction of Ni0 and PhI in benzene.30 Our computational
data indicate that the ligand exchange step from [(dppf)NiII(X)(Ph)] to [(dppf)NiIIX2] and [(dppf)NiII(Ph)2] is favorable, being exergonic for all halides
(ΔG = −7.5, −5.9, and −3.3
kcal/mol for X = Cl, Br, I, respectively; see Figure 5). Subsequent reductive elimination of biphenyl
and formation of [(dppf)Ni0(cod)] is also thermodynamically
favored (by 17.1 kcal/mol). Finally, comproportionation of [(dppf)NiIIX2] and [(dppf)Ni0(cod)] is also exergonic
for all halides, with ΔG = −1.5, −2.2,
and −1.5 kcal/mol for X = Cl, Br, I, respectively (relative
to the NiII and Ni0 complexes). As such, the
steps leading from [(dppf)NiII(Ph)(X)] to [NiI] are thermodynamically favored (see Figure 5).

and reductive elimination + comproportionation steps (a) and crystal

Would the [NiI] species
that we observed ultimately generate complex 1, leading
to a catalysis dead end, or perhaps remain a competent species for
the generation of ArSCF3? To test this, we initially subjected
(Me4N)SCF3 to [(dppf)NiI(Cl)]. This
led to rapid formation of the deactivated thiocarbonyl-bound [Ni0] complex 1, as judged by 19F NMR
analysis, suggesting that if any [(dppf)NiI(SCF3)] species were to be generated upon halogen to SCF3 exchange,
facile β-fluoride elimination would take place (Figure 6). In line with this, our calculations
of the β-F elimination from [(dppf)NiI(SCF3)] predicted that this process is relatively facile (ΔG⧧ = 20.6 kcal/mol). The thereby generated
[(dppf)NiI(F)] complex could subsequently undergo disproportionation
to generate [(dppf)NiII(F)2] and [Ni0]. The latter would ultimately trap S=CF2 to give 1 (Figure 6). Consistent with this mechanism, our quantitative 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis of the reaction mixture of (Me4N)SCF3 with [(dppf)NiI(Cl)] indicated that
after 1 h ∼50% of the employed [(dppf)NiI(Cl)] was
converted to [(dppf)Ni0(SCF2)] 1 (and ∼50% free dppf was also formed31).

Figure 6 Facile reactivity of [NiI] to form 1 (P-P
= dppf).

The transition states of β-fluoride
elimination from NiI (panel (a)) and NiII (panel
(b)) complexes are illustrated in Figure 7. The TS derived from NiI is slightly
later, as expressed by the longer C–F distance (2.12 Å
for NiI and 1.88 Å for NiII). This suggests
a greater stabilization in the TS derived from NiI, which
is reflected also in the shorter Ni–S distance in case of NiI (3.08 Å for NiI vs 3.31 Å for NiII) as well as the presence of a free coordination site.23

from NiI (a) and NiII (b), shown with the Ni–S
and C–F distances (in Å).

These results are a clear indicator that [(dppf)NiISCF3] is a competent and very potent source of the catalytically
inactive complex 1.32 The
generation of [NiI] therefore is detrimental to trifluoromethylthiolation.
The origin of lower conversions of aryl iodides and aryl bromides
in comparison to the generally less reactive aryl chlorides can be
unambiguously correlated to their relative propensity to form [NiI]. The key to productive catalysis in (dppf)Ni0-derived catalysis is therefore a low concentration of the [(dppf)NiII(X)(Ar)] intermediate that is formed upon oxidative addition
to prevent ligand exchanges, as well as a rapid transmetalation and
follow-up reaction. Transmetalation generally follows MII–Cl > MII–Br > MII–I
(for M = Pd, Ni),33 paralleling the observed
efficiencies of C–SCF3 bond formation.

Many
powerful Ni-catalyzed synthetic methods employ N-derived ligands,
such as pyridine derivatives, instead of the otherwise more donating
P-based ligands. In line with this, Vicic and co-workers elegantly
showed that Ni(cod)2 along with dmbpy (=4,4′-dimethoxybipyridine)
as a ligand results in the trifluoromethylthiolation of aryl iodides
and certain bromides, but not chlorides.17 In light of our above observations with P-derived Ni0, there hence appear to be fundamental reactivity differences between
N- and P-coordinated Ni catalysts. Given that N-derived ligands led
to the opposite reactivity (X = I, efficient; X = Cl, no conversion),
this implies that for N-based ligands either the formation of NiI is suppressed or the competing β-F elimination is no
longer favorable, therefore avoiding catalyst deactivation products.

We thus also computationally assessed the dmbpy/Ni(cod)2-catalyzed trifluoromethylthiolation of aryl iodides.34 The obtained data suggest that, in stark contrast
to Ni0/dppf, the corresponding Ni0/dmbpy system
does not proceed via Ni0/NiII catalysis but
instead by NiI/NiIII (see Figure 8). Interestingly, the Ni0/NiII catalytic cycle is disfavored primarily due to a high-barrier
reductive elimination step of ArSCF3 from [(dmbpy)NiII(SCF3)(Ph)] (ΔG⧧ = 33.1 kcal/mol). In contrast, a NiI/NiIII pathway is characterized by much lower activation free energy barriers
of 12.9 kcal/mol for oxidative addition and 16.1 kcal/mol for reductive
elimination (Figure 8b). These data also agree with previous studies highlighting facile
oxidative addition to (N-N)NiI complexes.6h,35

Figure 8 (a)
Computational comparison of β-F-elimination and reductive elimination
pathways with dmbpy-ligated NiII. (b) NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle being favored over β-F elimination.

Moreover, the corresponding β-F
elimination from [(dmbpy)NiI(SCF3)] is significantly
less favored (ΔG⧧ = 23.6
kcal/mol) than the productive pathway: oxidative addition of [(dmbpy)NiISCF3] to ArI occurs preferentially (ΔΔG⧧=10.7 kcal/mol). While the β-F
eliminations are comparable in magnitude for N- and P-derived NiI species, the N-based system is overall more effective, as
the barriers for the productive NiI/NiIII pathway
are significantly lower. In comparison, the direct oxidative addition
of iodobenzene to [(dppf)NiI(SCF3)] is calculated
to proceed with a barrier of 32.8 kcal/mol, being significantly greater
(ΔΔG⧧ = 12.2 kcal/mol)
than the barrier of the competing β-F elimination pathway. The
observed trends are likely related to the different steric properties
of the dmbpy and dppf ligands. The smaller bipyridine ligand would
still allow facile oxidative addition to the tricoordinate NiI-SCF3, while the lack of steric bulk would stabilize
the NiII species and thus not allow facile reductive elimination.
With dppf, on the other hand, the steric bulk of the phenyl groups
readily allows reductive elimination from NiII but hampers
oxidative addition to NiI.

Overall, these data strongly
indicate that (dppf)NiI primarily is a less competent catalyst
than (dppf)Ni0, as it suffers from a relatively high oxidative
addition barrier to ArX, which renders the competing β-F elimination
favored, ultimately giving the catalytically inactive complex 1. In stark contrast, bipyridine-ligand-derived NiI shows much lower barriers for productive catalysis, rendering the
competing processes disfavored. The β-F elimination therefore
has served as a mechanistic probe to differentiate between the divergent
reactivities of the various plausible oxidation states (0, I, and
II) as a function of ligand, using a combination of experiments and
computation. Such unambiguous differentiations are otherwise challenging
to accomplish.

Conclusions
In summary, using a
combination of computational and experimental studies, we examined
the key factors for efficiency in C–SCF3 bond formation,
catalyzed by phosphine- and nitrogen-based nickel complexes. Our data
show that, for dppf, [NiI] species may readily form with
the relative ease ArI > ArBr > ArCl under typical [Ni0] catalysis conditions. This will be detrimental for the agrochemically
and pharmaceutically relevant C–SCF3 bond formation,
as the corresponding [(dppf)NiI-SCF3] undergoes
facile β-fluoride elimination more readily over productive catalysis,
leading to [(dppf)Ni0(SCF2)] complex 1, which is catalytically incompetent and a catalysis dead end. Our
mechanistic data support that [(dppf)NiI] is derived from
NiII precursors via a comproportionation mechanism under
concomitant formation of biaryl, not through reductive electron transfer
pathways. The reverse was observed for the nitrogen-based Ni/dmbpy
system: the corresponding [NiI] species promotes efficient
NiI/NiIII catalysis, rendering unproductive
β-F elimination from NiI disfavored. In contrast,
a Ni0/NiII cycle suffers from high activation
barriers at the elementary steps (oxidative addition and reductive
elimination) with bipyridine as ligand. These data highlight the prerequisites
for selective Ni-catalyzed couplings of aryl halides and showcase
the potential and reactivity of NiI as a catalyst for different
ligands. Our future efforts are directed at exploring the full potential
of catalysis at NiI.

the same trends in reactivities and preferred reaction pathways. For
optimizations, we found the geometries resulting from ωB97XD
to reproduce the crystal structures well.

We also investigated the potential of alternative mechanisms being
at play, such as a phosphine participation in the C–F activation,
in analogy to: Nova A. ; Reinhold M. ; Perutz R. N. ; Macgregor S. A. ; McGrady J. E. 
Organometallics 
2010 , 29 , 1824 –1831 10.1021/om100064z .During the optimization of this TS, however, it collapsed back to
our reported TS geometry, where the F atom is transferred directly
to the Ni atom.


Similarly,
our attempts to “transmetalate” (Cl/SCF3 exchange)
[(dppf)NiII(Cl)(o-tolyl)] to [(dppf)NiII(SCF3)(o-tolyl)] also eventually
formed the thiocarbonyl-bound species 1 (see Figure 3).


The [(dppf)NiII(SCF3)(Ar)] intermediate could also undergo ligand exchange to produce
[(dppf)NiII(SCF3)2] and [(dppf)NiII(Ar)2]. Upon reductive elimination of Ar-Ar, comproportionation
of Ni0 and NiII could take place to form a “NiI-SCF3” species which may then undergo the
chemistry described in the article to give 1. While this
alternative explains the formation of 1 from ArSCF3, it does not explain the different reactivities observed,
ArI < ArBr < ArCl, which is the focus of the discussion.


The complexes were recrystallized
from different solvents ([NiI-Br] from benzene and [NiI-I] from THF).


Our
calculations of the spin density in the (dppf)NiIBr complex
indicate that the unpaired electron is localized predominantly on
the Ni center, suggesting that it is a NiI complex. Furthermore,
we also compared the C–Fe distances in the ferrocene moieties
of the obtained crystal structures with the corresponding distances
in FeII (CCDC 1154857) and FeIII (CCDC 194434,
170258, 138350, and 1194362) ferrocenes. The data indicate that our
NiI complexes are more similar to FeII ferrocene,
indicating that there is no substantial electronic exchange between
the ferrocene and the Ni center. See the Supporting Information for further information.

It is likely that NiII precipitated from the reaction mixture due to its poor solubility
in benzene. A single crystal grown from benzene/hexane yielded the
NiII species, while from THF/hexane crystals of the NiI species were obtained.


The formation of 1 was initially accompanied by the
appearance of a dark red precipitate, which ultimately (after ∼1
h) turned bright green, and free dppf could then be detected by 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis. The free dppf may originate
from the initially formed (dppf)NiF2, since our attempts
to independently prepare (dppf)NiF2 from dppf and NiF2 turned out to be unsuccessful, as indicated by the lack of
new signals in paramagnetic 1H NMR and quantitative recovery
of free ligand, on the basis of 31P qNMR analysis.


In comparison, it takes more than 24
h at 45 °C to fully convert PhSCF3 + [Ni0] to [Ni(SCF2)].
