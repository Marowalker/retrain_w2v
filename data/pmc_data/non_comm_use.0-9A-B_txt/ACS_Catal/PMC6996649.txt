The biocatalytic Friedel–Crafts acylation has
been identified
recently for the acetylation of resorcinol using activated acetic
acid esters for the synthesis of acetophenone derivatives catalyzed
by an acyltransferase. Because the wild-type enzyme is limited to
acetic and propionic derivatives as the substrate, variants were designed
to extend the substrate scope of this enzyme. By rational protein
engineering, the key residue in the active site was identified which
can be replaced to allow binding of bulkier acyl moieties. The single-point
variant F148V enabled the transformation of previously inaccessible
medium chain length alkyl and alkoxyalkyl carboxylic esters as donor
substrates with up to 99% conversion and up to >99% isolated yield.

Introduction
Carbon–carbon bond formation by
the Friedel–Crafts
reaction1 is state-of-the-art in organic
synthetic chemistry.2 Various catalysts
and different types of activated molecules have been employed.3 As an extension to established protocols and
because of environmental awareness and increasingly legal regulations,
alternative concepts are investigated including biocatalytic approaches.4 Research on Friedel–Crafts alkylation
using enzymes for methyl-, prenyl-, and glycosylation has recently
been published.5 For instance, S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent C-methyltransferases were identified to modify flavonoid and alkaloid
scaffolds to yield products with a specific methylation pattern.6 Prenyltransferases (PTases) were reported to
catalyze cofactor-independent transfer reactions of prenyl moieties
from isoprenoid donors to the aromatic ring of prenyl acceptors, leading
to a wide range of terpenoids.7,8 Wild-type PTases typically
exhibited a strict specificity for prenyl donors. Extended engineering
studies on a recently discovered PTase (AtaPT, from Aspergillus terreus) allowed tuning of both the substrate
scope and the prenylation selectivity.9

Sequence and structure-guided mutagenesis has been successfully
applied to O-glycosyltransferases, which resulted
in replacing the O-glycosylation to C-glycosylation activity.10,11

All the above mentioned biocatalytic reactions represent alkylations;
in contrast, a biocatalytic equivalent to the classical Friedel–Crafts
acylation based on a natural disproportionation12 has been published recently for the C-acylation of phloroglucinol
and resorcinol derivatives bearing alkyl, alkoxy, and halo-functionalities
by a recombinant acyltransferase from Pseudomonas protegens (PpATaseCH).13 The biocatalytic
reaction proceeded with exquisite regioselectivity at the C6 position
under ambient reaction conditions using various non-natural donor
substrates,13,14 to form dihydroxyphenyl ketones
which are key motifs found in many therapeutic targets, fine chemicals,
and natural products.3,15 Furthermore, ATase exhibited
reaction promiscuity and accepted aniline derivatives as substrates
for amide bond formation.16 Elucidation
of the crystal structure of the biocatalyst and soaking experiments
indicated the involvement of a cysteine (C88) in the subunit PhlC
in the mechanism reacting with acetyl donors to give a thioester as
an intermediate.17 The carbonyl oxygen
of the C88-bound acetyl group is positioned in the oxyanion hole,
while the methyl group of acetyl is directed toward a small hydrophobic
cavity formed by F148, L209, and L300.

The scope of acyl donors
was previously restricted to acetyl and
propionyl groups. Here, structure-based molecular modeling allowed
us to expand significantly the scope of acyl donors to transform medium-chain
length acyl and alkoxyacetyl moieties.

Results and Discussion
The acyltransferase from P. protegens transfers an acetyl group or a propionyl
group to resorcinol (1); however, no activity was detected
toward acyl substrates
bearing longer side-chains, such as butanoyl.13 To investigate the transfer of sterically more demanding acyl groups,
2,6-diacylated phloroglucinol derivatives mimicking the native donor
substrate diacetylphloroglucinol were synthesized. Thus, butanoyl
(3a), isobutanoyl (3b), hexanoyl (3c), benzoyl (3d), or phenylacetyl (3e) were attached to the phloroglucinol scaffold (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Biocatalytic Friedel–Crafts
Acylation Investigated
Acyl donors 3a–3e were selected as initial probes to investigate acyltransferase variants
to accept sterically more demanding substrates. Donors 3f–3s were investigated subsequently.

To identify
residues in the enzyme which might be responsible for
the limited substrate scope, a rational approach was chosen. From
the crystal structure of PpATaseCH (PDB codes 5M3K, 5MG5) (Figure S2, Supporting Information), it was deduced that
residues F148, L300, L383, Y386, and Y298 located in the environment
of the acetyl group may limit the size of the cavity for substrate
binding. The acetyl group covalently attached to C88 in the crystal
structure of the enzyme was manually modeled to a butanoyl moiety
in order to identify residues which might sterically interfere with
the binding of longer acyl chains. Based on this analysis, F148 was
subsequently replaced by valine and alanine (Figure 1). Also, the region of the lid, besides the
substrate binding region, is involved in modulating activity, selectivity,
and stability in selected enzymes (e.g., lipases and kinases).18 Studies have demonstrated that an access to
the enzyme active site is controlled by the position of the lid, that
undergoes a transition between an open and a closed conformation as
the enzyme binds the substrate in the catalytic cycle. It was shown
that protein engineering of lid structures might provide either enzymes
with new properties or reduction in the enzyme activity.19 To investigate if residue W211, possessing the
lid function, impedes the entrance of bulky substrates to the active
site, it was replaced by smaller residues.

Figure 1 Crystal structure with
the butanoyl residue modeled into the active
site by extending the acetyl moiety manually and introducing mutation
F148V by PyMOL mutation wizard. Figures were prepared using PyMOL.

The selected amino acids were replaced by side-directed
mutagenesis
for sterically less demanding amino acids such as alanine or valine.
Consequently, a focused library consisting of 11 single variants (F148A,
F148V, W211A, W211F, Y298A, Y298V, L300A, L300V, L383A, L383V, and
Y386V) was prepared and examined to catalyze the acylation of 1 using 3a–3e as acyl donor substrates.

All of the tested variants were functional proteins and displayed
reduced specific activity toward the native substrate MAPG (Supporting Information, Table S1). Importantly,
only the exchange of F148 to either alanine or valine (F148A/V) enabled
to transfer sterically more demanding acyl moieties (Table 1). For instance, using 3a as the substrate, the butanoyl moiety was transferred to
resorcinol with 53 and 67% conversion using F148A and F148V, respectively
(Table 1, entry 2–3).
Side-chain elongation of the acyl group to six carbon atoms (3c) resulted still in 55 and 24% conversion, and for a branched
side-chain (3b), 6 and 9% conversion, respectively, was
obtained. Even the benzoyl moiety (3d) was accepted,
although just 1% conversion was reached under the conditions employed.
In contrast, substrate 3e bearing the phenylacetyl group
was not transformed. Residue F148 was clearly identified as the key
position for acyl donor selectivity, and the mutation of this residue
to either alanine or valine enables the acceptance of enlarged acyl
donors.

a Conditions: cell-free Escherichia coli extract containing ATase variant
(1.5 mg total protein) in K-phosphate-buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5, total
volume 1 mL), resorcinol (1, 0.01 mmol), donor 3a–3e (0.015 mmol), imidazole (100 mM added from a
1 M stock solution prepared in the reaction buffer), 35 °C, 750
rpm, 24 h. Conversions were determined based on three experiments
by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using calibration
curves with authentic samples.

b Specific activity refers to the
activity of the enzyme for the disproportionation of monoacetylphloroglucinol
into diacetylphloroglucinol and phloroglucinol.

c Cell-free E. coli extract containing ATase variant (3 mg total protein).

Consequently, variants F148V and F148A were chosen
as the base
for further variants, in which the variants F148A/V were combined
with the other residues mentioned before (W211, L300, L383, and Y386),
leading to the preparation of nine double variants (Table 1) and one triple variant (F148V/W211A/Y386A).

All double variants and the triple variant were able to catalyze
the acyl transfer from donor substrates 3a and 3c; however, only a few of them accepted 3b and 3d and again none of them converted 3e (Table 1, entries 4–13).
Actually, all double/triple variants investigated displayed lower
conversions than the single variant F148V. Although we expected initially
that an enlarged active site would even more easily accommodate bulky
acyl donors, the results may indicate that probably besides steric
restraints, also positive interactions are responsible to ensure the
transformation of a substrate. Concluding, for the probes 3a–d investigated, F148V led to the highest conversion.

Thermal
stability experiments (Supporting Information Figures S4–S7) were performed for the most interesting variants
(F148A, F148V, and F148V/L383A) and the native enzyme. For all catalysts,
immediate thermal denaturation was observed at 70 °C. The native
enzyme displayed high stability in a temperature range of 30–50
°C, maintaining >85% activity after 240 min. Enzyme variants
showed lower stability and may be used at 35 °C with half-life
around 50 min for F148A, 140 min for F148V, and 240 min for F148V/L383A.

Based on previous studies on acetyl derivatives,14 it was expected that other activated acyl donors may be
suited as well. Consequently, the reactivity of the F148V variant
was assayed using vinyl butyrate (3f), methyl thiobutyrate
(3g), and phenyl butyrate (3h). Because
the transformation with these donors led to reduced conversion when
using the same reaction conditions as for 3a, the influence
of the donor concentration and the influence of additives such as
imidazole, detergents, or cosolvents was investigated to obtain improved
conversion (Table 2). Imidazole was previously identified to improve the reaction with
2-propenyl acetate.14b

a Reaction conditions: cell-free E. coli extract containing ATase F148A (1.5–6
mg total protein) in KPi-buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5, total volume 1 mL),
resorcinol (1, 0.01 mmol), donor 3d–3h (0.1 mmol) with or without imidazole (Im, 100 mM added from a 1
M stock solution prepared in the reaction buffer), or with DMSO (10%
v/v), or Triton X-100 (0.25 mM), or Tween 40 (0.03 mM), 35 °C,
750 rpm, 24 h.

It turned out that an excess of acyl donor had a beneficial
effect
on the conversion (entry 3 vs 8–9). Moreover, the increase
in enzyme loading to 6 mg improved product conversion from 30 to 54%
(entry 3 vs 4). Subsequently, the influence of various additives was
investigated. Compared to reaction performed without additives (27%,
entry 7), the addition of imidazole (30%, entry 3) or dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (32%, entry 6) led to a small improvement. Likewise, surfactants
(31, 35%, entries 10–11) slightly promoted the reaction. Finally,
phenyl esters were chosen as the most attractive type of acyl donors
because not only did they lead to highest conversion (30%, Table 2, entry 3 vs entries
1 and 2) but also many are commercially or accessible via simple synthetic
methods.

To provide further insight into the scope of donors,
the variant
F148V was tested with a broad range of phenyl esters with varied side
chains as donor substrates (3i–3s, Scheme 2). Compared to the wild-type,
the F148V variant clearly showed a significant extended substrate
scope. Donor scaffolds bearing functional groups, such as double bonds
or hydroxyl groups, were investigated. For instance, phenyl pent-4-enoate
(3i) led to conversion up to 35%, while neither phenyl
(E)-but-2-enoate nor phenyl 3-methylbut-2-enoate
was transformed (both possessing a conjugated double bond, Supporting Information, Scheme S2). Short-chain
substrate 3j bearing a hydroxyl group in position 2 was
poorly accepted by F148V (5%), but significant activity was observed
for the wild-type enzyme (55%). When the hydroxyl moiety was protected
as methyl ether, wild-type ATase displayed no measurable conversion
for the corresponding phenyl 2-methoxyacetate (3k), which
is consistent with previous observations, that the native enzyme accepts
only short acyl moieties. Interestingly, the same acyl donor 3k was well accepted by the F148V variant, reaching completion
at 10 mmol substrate concentration within 24 h. Thus, compared to
the aliphatic donor (3h) with the same number of atoms,
the 2-alkoxy compound (3k) led to the significantly higher
conversion (35 vs >99%).

30 °C, 120 rpm, 24 h, horizontal tube position.

Since 1990s, alkyl methoxyacetates have been used as an
efficient
source of acyl moieties for lipase-catalyzed resolutions of chiral
amines.20 The presence of a methoxy substituent
accelerated the reaction, so the initial acylation rate was 100 times
faster than the corresponding reaction with ethyl butyrate.21 Interaction between the β-oxygen atom
in methoxyacetate and the amine nitrogen atom was found to be a key
factor in the rate enhancement. High preference for the alkoxyacetyl
moiety had also been identified for an acyltransferase in amide bond
formation.22

Consequently, various
alkoxyacetyl donor substrates were subjected
to the Friedel–Crafts bioacylation. Elongation of the alkoxy
side chain from methoxy to ethoxy (substrate 3l) allowed
again to achieve >99% conversion, and also for groups (3m, 70%), good conversion was reached. However, when shifting the oxygen
atom in the acyl moiety from position 2 to position 3 resulted in
reduced conversion, such as 8% for the butanoyl analogue (3n) and the unprotected hydroxyl groups (3o, <0.1%).
On introduction of a second oxygen atom in the side chain of the well
accepted donor 3m, donor 3p led to a comparable
conversion of 73%.

Even the donor bearing a phenyl group linked
to the oxygen atom
in 2-position was accepted with reasonable conversion (3q, 41% conv.). This may be of importance because 2q constitutes
the core structure of various antivirulence agents and potential adjuvants
for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus-derived diseases.23

Because oxygen
in the side chain showed a tremendous influence
on the conversion, we wondered what might be the effect if the oxygen
atom in, for example, donor 3k gets exchanged with sulfur
(donor 3r). The side chains of the O- and S-donors differ
only slightly in their sizes, but sulfur is a weaker hydrogen bond
acceptor.24 The corresponding product 2r was obtained with 31% conversion, which represents a lower
value compared to the analogue compound 2k (>99% conv.).
Obviously, the oxygen at position 2 has a significant effect; however,
the exact binding could not be elucidated using docking experiments.

Interestingly, other acyl donors possessing an aromatic ring, such
as benzoyl phenylacetyl or phenylpropionyl were not transformed (see Supporting Information, Scheme S2). Medium-chain
length donor 3s led to similar conversion as for native-substrate
mimicking analogue 3c.

To demonstrate the applicability
of the biotransformation, semipreparative
transformations were performed starting with 0.25 mmol of substrate 1. Reactions were run for 24 h, and products were isolated
with high yields with up to 99% (Scheme 2, values in brackets). Generally, isolated
product yields were comparable to the conversions obtained in analytical-scale
experiments. In few cases, isolated product yield values were even
higher because of the slightly altered reaction conditions including
lower reaction temperature (30 °C instead of 35 °C), shaking
speed (120 rpm instead of 750 rpm), and horizontal tube positioning
while shaking (instead of vertical). In selected cases, hydrolysis
of O-acetylated coproduct was required. As previously shown,13 reaction with carboxylic acid esters may give
the Friedel–Crafts product or lead to spontaneous O-acylation,
whereby the O-acylated products may serve again as the acyl donor;
this is in contrast to phloroglucinol derivatives for which no O-acetylation
was detected.

Finally, to evaluate the effect of the mutation
F148V, the kinetic
parameters of the variant and the wild-type enzyme PpATaseCH were compared for the disproportionation of monoacetylphlorogucinol
(MAPG) and monobutanoylphlorogucinol (MBPG) into the corresponding
products, diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) and 3a, respectively.
Initial velocities were measured at substrate concentrations of 0.04–1.6
mM. Variant F148V showed 10 times lower catalytic efficiency toward
the native substrate MAPG than the wild type as indicated by kcat/KM (Table 3). The lowered kcat/KM value results
mainly of a 10-fold decrease in kcat.
The comparable KM values indicate that
binding is similar. In the case of the more bulky compound MBPG, the
wild type showed no detectable activity, while F148V led to kinetic
parameters similar as observed for the variant with MAPG.

a Spectrophotometric assay: potassium
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) and substrate 0.04–1.6 mM
(added from a 40 mM stock solution prepared in DMSO) were added to
a cuvette and preheated to 35 °C. The reaction (1 mL total volume)
was started by the addition of purified enzyme (0.18 mg). The reaction
was followed for over 1 min. An increase in absorption is recorded
because of the formation of DAPG (λ = 370 nm) or DBPG (λ
= 370 nm). All reactions were performed in triplicates.

b HPLC assay: potassium phosphate
buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5), donor 3h or 3k 0.5–25
mM (added from a 50 mM stock solution prepared in DMSO), resorcinol
(1, 0.275 mg, 10 mM), imidazole (100 mM, added from a
1 M stock solution in phosphate buffer) were added to an Eppendorf
tube. The reaction (0.25 mL total volume) was started by the addition
of purified enzyme (0.75 mg). The reaction mixture was shaken (5 min
for 3k and 60 min for 3h) at 35 °C
and 750 rpm in an orbital shaker. Reactions were quenched by addition
of acetonitrile (0.25 mL). The precipitated protein was removed by
centrifugation (20 min, 14 000 rpm), and the supernatant was
subjected to HPLC for determination of conversions.

c Reaction rates were lower than the
detection limit, V < 0.014 mmol min–1.

Because a significant effect of an oxygen atom in
position 2 of
the acyl donor was noted, kinetic parameters for 3h and 3k were determined in the acylation of resorcinol 1. The amount of resorcinol was kept constant (10 mM), while the initial
velocities were measured at different concentrations of donors (0.5–25
mM). The transformation of each donor into the corresponding product
was monitored by measuring the increase in product concentration.

The results show a significant difference in the kcat values of the butanoyl and methoxyacetyl side chains;
for the methoxyacetyl side chain, the kcat was 15.7-fold higher than for butanoyl.

Conclusions
For extending the spectrum of acyl groups
accepted by the wild-type
ATase, rational enzyme engineering was used to identify potential
amino acid exchanges, which may generate more space in the active
site pocket. Enzyme variants generated by side-directed mutagenesis
were screened first toward a set of diacylated phloroglucinols as
donor substrates, being closest to the native substrate. The results
showed that phenylalanine 148 is a key position for mutagenesis, whereby
F148V turned out to be suited best. Additional mutations to increase
the cavity of the active site even further did not lead to the desired
effect. Investigation of different types of the activated butanoyl
group indicated that phenyl esters are highly suitable substrates.
A broad set of various functionalized phenyl esters was investigated
as acyl donors. Interestingly, acyl donors possessing an oxygen atom
in position 2 turned out to be well accepted substrates, leading to
significant higher conversion than the corresponding methylene substrates;
for instance, methoxyacetyl led to >99% conversion, while butanoyl
led to 35% conversion under comparable conditions. This methodology
allowed us to use ATase for the synthesis of 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-phenoxyethan-1-one
(2q), which constitutes the core structure of various
antivirulence agents.
