Syringaresinol
was synthesized in a one-pot conversion containing
eugenol oxidase (EUGO) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using the
relatively cheap 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol as a substrate. This
conversion is fully coupled as the hydrogen peroxide generated from
the reaction of EUGO with the substrate is utilized by the HRP to
convert the formed sinapyl alcohol into syringaresinol. To improve
the performance of EUGO on 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol,
structure-inspired enzyme engineering was performed. This yielded
the I427A EUGO mutant that is significantly more efficient with 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol.
The I427A EUGO mutant together with HRP were capable of efficiently
producing syringaresinol as a major product. After optimization and
upscaling the conversion to a semipreparative scale (1 gr), syringaresinol
was obtained in 81% yield.

==== Body
One-pot enzymatic cascades have
received an increasing attention over recent years.1,2 Such
approaches are attractive as they save time, money, and energy needed
to make or isolate compounds with a high degree of purity and quality.3 These cascades also allow conversions in which
labile intermediates can be used. One-pot cascades have involved a
wide range of enzymes ranging from but not exclusive to dehydrogenases,
transaminases, Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases, and oxidases.2−5 Recently, we published a one-pot two-enzyme cascade conversion utilizing
an oxidase and a peroxidase to convert eugenol into lignin-like oligomers.6 The diversity of enzymes used in one-pot reactions
has added to the value of this approach to synthesize various chiral
compounds and other compounds which are difficult to be produced by
conventional chemical means.

In this paper, the synthesis of
syringaresinol (3)
in a one-pot two-enzyme conversion is described (see Scheme 1). Syringaresinol (3) is a lignan formed from two sinapyl alcohol (2) units
linked via a β–β linkage. The lignan is known to
display various interesting bioactivity properties. It inhibits the
motility of Helicobacter pylori in
the stomach thus playing a role in protection from gastric cancer.7 It has also been found to help in the healing
of wounds when present as a glucoside.8,9 Chung and co-workers
displayed the effect of syringaresinol (3) in increasing
the production of nitric oxide from nitric oxide synthase and its
complementary effect on vasorelaxation of blood vessels.10 Syringaresinol is a very rigid compound due
to the presence of a cis-fused bis-furanic moiety
in its structure. This makes it an attractive candidate for use as
a substitute for bisphenol A in industrial resins.11,12

Scheme 1 Conversion of 2,6-Dimethoxy-4-allylphenol (1) to Sinapyl
Alcohol (2) Using EUGO and Sinapyl Alcohol to Syringaresinol
(3) Using HRP
Despite being available naturally in plants, syringaresinol
is
isolated from natural sources in a very low yield.8 Chemical synthesis of syringaresinol has achieved yields
reaching 67% through copper catalysis. However, these methods are
problematic with regard to the toxicity of the chemicals used and
the costs of the various purification steps involved.10 The biocatalytic synthesis of syringaresinol from sinapyl
alcohol has been described recently using a laccase from Trametes versicolor producing the lignan in a yield
of 93% in one step.8 This method is very
efficient in a multigram scale, yet, concern should be taken to the
price of the starting material, sinapyl alcohol.

Inspired by
the approach in which sinapyl alcohol is converted
into syringaresinol, we designed a two-step one-pot conversion starting
from the relatively cheap 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol. This allylphenol
was shown to be a substrate for eugenol oxidase (EUGO) by which it
is converted into sinapyl alcohol. Except for sinapyl alcohol, hydrogen
peroxide is also formed upon conversion by EUGO. This prompted us
to choose a peroxidase to perform the oxidative coupling of the formed
sinapyl alcohol. The advantage of this system is that the hydrogen
peroxide generated by EUGO is utilized directly by the peroxidase.
While EUGO is the only known oxidase capable to convert 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
into sinapyl alcohol, the activity is relatively low when compared
with other substrates, such as eugenol, vanillyl alcohol and 4-(hydroxy-1-ethyl)-2-methoxyphenol.13,14 Analysis of the structure of EUGO suggests that the active site
of the enzyme has limited space for accommodating the two methoxy
groups in the substrate.

In order to optimize the efficiency
of the cascade conversion,
the activity of EUGO on 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol was optimized
by performing structure-inspired mutagenesis to create a larger active
site. The generated mutant EUGO was used with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) for the efficient conversion of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
into syringaresinol in high yield.

EUGO was previously shown
to exhibit activity with dimethoxy-substituted
phenolic substrates as opposed to other enzymes having a similar structure.13 The main reason for this unique property seems
to come from the fact that EUGO has a glycine at position 392, making
sufficient room for a second methoxy moiety on the phenolic substrate.
Still, EUGO displays a higher activity on phenolic substrates that
carry only one or no methoxy substituent. Inspection of the isoeugenol-complexed
crystal structure of EUGO (PDB: 5FXD) suggested several residues that may
hamper binding of the second methoxy moiety: Ile427 and Val166. Other
residues that are in the same area (Tyr91, Tyr471, and Arg472) were
not considered as targets for mutagenesis because they have a role
in arranging a proper interaction with the 4-hydroxy group of the
substrate. In fact, these latter three amino acids are involved in
the stabilization of the phenolate form of the substrate and therefore
play a role in forming the quinone methide intermediate (see Figure 1).13 In order to accommodate two methoxy groups in the substrate
binding pocket, several Ile427 and Val166 mutants were prepared: I427V,
I427A, I427G, and V166A. By introducing relatively small residues,
more efficient binding of the target substrate may be achieved.

Figure 1 Active site
of EUGO with the flavin cofactor (yellow), a docked
2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol (green) and highlighting residues (cyan):
Tyr91, Tyr471, and Arg472, essential for stabilization of the phenolate
form of the bound substrate, and Ile427 and Val166 that were mutated
to improve the activity with 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol.

The steady state kinetics for the conversion of
2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
(1) for each of the three different Ile427 mutants revealed
that the most active mutant was the I427A (kcat = 0.72 s–1, Km = 0.46 μM). This mutant enzyme displays a more than 2-fold
higher kcat when compared with the wild
type enzyme while also the apparent affinity (Km) decreased (wt-EUGO: kcat = 0.37
s–1, Km = 0.77 μM).
The other two mutants also displayed improved kinetic parameters (I427V: kcat = 0.59 s–1, Km = 0.34 μM, I427G: kcat = 0.59 s–1, Km = 0.39
μM). Yet, the I427G mutant suffered from substrate inhibition
at elevated substrate concentrations. The V166A mutant displayed a
somewhat lower Km but also a reduced activity
when compared with wild type EUGO (V166A: kcat = 0.124 s–1, Km =
0.39 μM). The steady-state kinetic data for all above-mentioned
enzymes are shown in Figure S1. Due to
its superior kinetic properties, EUGO I427A was used to explore its
use as biocatalyst for producing sinapyl alcohol.

Sinapyl alcohol
is a relatively expensive compound, whereas 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
(1), its precursor in this study, is several orders of
magnitude cheaper. This is probably due to the fact that (1) and other 4-allylphenols
can be readily isolated from herbs and spices. This makes it attractive
to explore the use of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol as a starting material
to prepare high-value compounds, such as sinapyl alcohol. We first
studied the conversion of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol into sinapyl
alcohol using EUGO I427A. When 0.5 μM of EUGO I427A was used
in the conversion, incomplete conversion of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
to sinapyl alcohol was seen (data not shown). It was found that EUGO
I427A was capable of completely converting 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
into sinapyl alcohol within 22 h when 5 μM of the enzyme was
added to a solution containing 10 mM of the substrate. No other products
could be detected (see Figure S2).

After having established that EUGO I427A can be used to produce
sinapyl alcohol, a cascade reaction that included the oxidase and
HRP was investigated. Incubation of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol with
EUGO I427A and HRP in one-pot resulted in formation of one major soluble
product: syringaresinol, a dimer of two sinapyl alcohol monomers linked
to each other through a β–β linkage. When EUGO
I427A (5 μM) and HRP (0.65 μM) were added to a reaction
containing 10 mM 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol, complete conversion
of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol to racemic syringaresinol as a major
product was achieved after 25 h (see Figure S3). The reaction proceeds through the formation of sinapyl alcohol
by oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol by EUGO, whereas, in a
second step, HRP utilizes the hydrogen peroxide that is generated
to form a free radical from the formed sinapyl alcohol. Through dimerization
of the formed radicals, syringaresinol is formed. Though it is known
that HRP can be inactivated by hydrogen peroxide, the in situ production
of the cosubstrate prevented accumulation of excessive hydrogen peroxide
limiting this inactivation effect. 2,6-Dimethoxy-4-allylphenol is
a unique substrate as both the 2- and 6-positions are blocked by methoxy-groups
for alternative coupling reactions. This hinders the ability to form
other linkages that are characteristic of lignin polymers, as found
when using eugenol as a precursor in a EUGO/HRP-catalyzed reaction.8 The two methoxy moieties direct the reaction
toward formation of the dimerized oxidation product from sinapyl alcohol.

Some insoluble product was also formed in the reaction above, which
was isolated and analyzed separately. GPC analysis of the material
showed that the insoluble product consisted of higher molecular weight
material, in the range of oligomers with a length of 2–10 aromatic
units (see Figure S4, Mn = 600, Mw = 750, d = 1.24).
Analysis by 2D HSQC and 2D HMBC nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed
major signals that can be ascribed to syringaresinol as well as to
2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol units (Figures S5 and S6). Unlike our previously reported work on eugenol, no
clear lignin type linkages were detected using 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
as a substrate apart from the β–β linkages from
syringaresinol. A signal for a β-O-4 linkage that has been modified
on the α-position could be observed; however, the exact nature
of this β-O-4 type linkage or other connectivity of the aromatic
units remains unclear. Overall, it seems that the conversion of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol
by this enzyme cascade has a high preference for the formation of β–β
dimers over typical β-O-4 type linkages.

After testing
the conversion of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-alllylphenol to
syringaresinol on a small scale, a one gram conversion was performed.
The conversion was done in a 250 mL reaction volume using 5% dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO, v/v) as a cosolvent. After high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis confirmed complete conversion of the starting material,
the product was isolated from the solution by ethyl acetate extraction
and purified by column chromatography. The whole conversion was completed
in 22 h and resulted in a yield of 870 mg (81%) syringaresinol from
1 g of the starting material. The isolated syringaresinol appeared
as pale yellow crystals. Figure S7 shows
the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra for the isolated
lignan. In addition to the syringaresinol, ≈80 mg of insoluble
product was formed.

We have successfully been able to produce
syringaresinol in a high
yield from a relatively cheap precursor in a facile one-pot two-enzyme
conversion. For this, first the performance of the required oxidase
was successfully optimized through site-directed mutagenesis of EUGO
to improve its acceptance of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol as a substrate.
The combined use of EUGO I427A and HRP resulted in full conversion
of 2,6-dimethoxy-4-allylphenol and formation of syringaresinol as
major product. The lignan was purified (81% yield) after a 1 g scale
conversion and analyzed using both 1H NMR and 13C NMR to confirm its purity. This newly developed biocatalytic system
for synthesis of syringaresinol could serve as a good source for producing
this medically and industrially important compound on a large scale.
