Adaptive ligands,
which can adapt their coordination mode to the
electronic structure of various catalytic intermediates, offer the
potential to develop improved homogeneous catalysts in terms of activity
and selectivity. 2,2′-Diphosphinobenzophenones have previously
been shown to act as adaptive ligands, the central ketone moiety preferentially
coordinating reduced metal centers. Herein, the utility of this scaffold
in nickel-catalyzed alkyne cyclotrimerization is investigated. The
complex [(p-tolL1)Ni(BPI)]
(p-tolL1 = 2,2′-bis(di(para-tolyl)phosphino)-benzophenone; BPI = benzophenone imine)
is an active catalyst in the [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization of terminal
alkynes, selectively affording 1,2,4-substituted benzenes from terminal
alkynes. In particular, this catalyst outperforms closely related
bi- and tridentate phosphine-based Ni catalysts. This suggests a reaction
pathway involving a hemilabile interaction of the C=O unit
with the nickel center. This is further borne out by a comparative
study of the observed resting states and DFT calculations.

Introduction
The search for improved
activity and selectivity in transition-metal
based homogeneous catalysts strongly relies on the development of
steering ligands to tune the steric and electronic properties of the
metal center to the requirements of particular transformations. Recent
years have seen the development of more sophisticated adaptive or
cooperative ligands that can adjust their binding modes or engage
in chemical transformations along a catalytic cycle.1−4 The use of such ligands also plays an important role in the development
of catalysts based on inexpensive and nontoxic first-row transition
metals that can compete with, or even surpass, their counterparts
based on precious metals, contributing to a more sustainable chemistry.5 Perhaps one of the simplest implementations of
the concept of adaptive ligands are hemilabile ligands, which are
polydentate ligands featuring a weakly binding moiety that can reversibly
(de)coordinate the metal center.6 Since
their introduction in synthetic chemistry by Jeffrey and Rauchfuss,7 hemilabile ligands have played a significant
role in the current transition from noble to base metals in homogeneous
catalysis. The hemilabile interaction is important not only for opening
up a masked coordination site but also to stabilize catalytic intermediates,
by allowing the supporting ligand to adapt its binding mode throughout
the reaction coordinate. Most commonly, weak donor groups, such as
ether (OR2),7,8 amine (NR3),9 or imine derivatives (R2C=NR),8b,10 are employed as the labile unit, often resulting in enhanced catalytic
activity for different kinds of reactions. Examples include olefin
oligomerizations and polymerizations,8c,11 (cyclo)trimerization,9c,11 carbonylation of methanol and methyl acetate,12 (transfer) hydrogenation of ketones or dehydrogenation
of alcohols,9b,13,14 hydroacylation of alkenes and alkynes,8d,15 and coupling reactions.9c,11−19

In addition to weak σ-donor moieties, σ-acceptor
groups20 (e.g., triarylborane)21 or π-ligands2 (e.g., C=C
double bond)22 can also act as hemilabile
fragments. Our group recently reported the hemilabile character of
the ligand 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzophenone23 (PhL1) bound to nickel24 and other first-row transition metals.25PhL1 was shown to function
as a hemilabile π-acceptor ligand, with the central C=O
bond coordinating to the metal center in its more reduced forms (Figure 1). Ru,23,26 Rh,27−29 Os,30 and Ir31 complexes of PhL1 were
also studied, more specifically in the catalytic hydrogenation of
ketones,23,26,28,30 in which the formation of a hydroxyalkyl species
was accessible via the hydrogenation of the ketone moiety of the ligand.28

Figure 1 Previous work.24 Coordination
of a diphosphine
benzophenone ligand, PhL1, to nickel(0), nickel(I),
and nickel(II).

In this context, we set
out to assess the potential utility of
an η2-bound hemilabile π-acceptor moiety incorporated
in a pincer type architecture for catalysis, using the cyclotrimerization
of alkynes as a benchmark reaction. Since its discovery by Reppe et
al.32 using a [Ni(CO)2(PCl3)2] catalyst, intermolecular [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization
of alkynes has been widely studied.33 Metal
catalyzed cyclotrimerization is an elegant method for the formation
of cyclic frameworks, particularly convenient when the desired product
is not accessible via traditional aromatic substitution reactions.
Many transition metal systems have been developed (e.g., Ti,34 Fe,35 Co,36 Ni,37 Mo,38 Ru,39 Rh,40 Pd,41 Ir42). Literature precedents for the nickel-catalyzed
conversion of alkynes to substituted benzene regio-isomers are known,
both from an intramolecular36c,37g−37l,37n,37p,37r,37s and intermolecular approach.9c,32,36a,37a−37f,37m,37o,37q,37t−37z For the [2 + 2 + 2] intermolecular alkyne cyclotrimerization, it
starts from the early example by Reppe et al.32 to the combination of divalent nickel halide salts and reductants36a,37f or even activated Ni-particles.37b Phosphine,9c,36a,37j,37m,37t,37v NHC,37v,37x mixed phosphine/imino (P,N),9c or 1,4-diazadiene37c,37e,37u,37w,37y,37z ligands, have been introduced to Ni systems in order to improve
selectivity and catalytic activity. Phosphine complexes generally
favor the formation of benzene derivatives while 1,4-diazadiene complexes
yield cyclooctatetraenes.

Besides their synthetic utility, alkyne
condensations are also
useful probes for ligand effects in catalysis.43 The possible formation of different products and isomers,
such as cyclotrimers, cyclotetramers, linear oligomers, polymers,
and other compounds, provides useful information about the reactivity
of a particular catalyst. For example, Uyeda37w,44 and Ess44 recently applied this approach
to the evaluation of the effect of catalyst nuclearity, and Jones9c applied it to assessing differences in catalytic
performance between bidentate PP and PN ligands (Figure 2). In this study, we assess
the effect of using hemilabile π-acceptor tridentate ligand
(p-tolL1; Figure 3) in alkyne cyclotrimerization
through comparison with diverse nickel systems. Ni(0) adopting a strong
tridentate architecture (ligand = p-tolL2; Figure 3) and Ni complexes supported by a bidentate ligand (PhL3; Figure 3) were selected for comparison with p-tolL1.

the catalytic properties

Figure 3 Tridentate and bidentate ligands of comparison in this study.

Here we report the synthesis of
nickel(0) complexes of p-tolL1, p-tolL2, and PhL3 featuring benzophenone imine (BPI)
as a labile protecting ligand.
Their stoichiometric reactivity with terminal alkynes is investigated,
and the resulting Ni–alkyne complexes are thoroughly characterized.
Then, a comparative study of these bi- and tridentate Ni(0)-catalysts
in the cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes is described, aiming
to study the effect of a hemilabile π-acceptor system. For all
tested alkyne substrates, p-tolL1 outperforms p-tolL2 and PhL3, as well as the structurally
more different diphosphine rac-BINAP (PhL4), in terms of selectivity and activity. Reactivity
studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the increased
catalytic activity, suggesting that p-tolL1 can adapt its binding mode throughout the reaction pathway,
by the labile (de)coordination of its ketone unit.

Results and Discussion
Ni(0)-Benzophenone
Imine Complexes
The diphosphine–benzophenone
pincer-type ligand23 2,2′-bis(di(para-tolyl)phosphino)-benzophenone25 (p-tolL1; Figure 3) and the triphosphine
pincer-type ligand45 bis(2-(di-(para-tolyl)phosphino)phenyl)phenylphosphine (p-tolL2; Figure 3) were synthesized according
to (adapted) literature procedures,24,25,46 by lithiation of o-bromo(diarylphosphino)benzene47 with n-BuLi followed by reaction
with the appropriate electrophile (Scheme 1). para-Tolyl substituents
on the phosphine were introduced both to improve the solubility of
the complexes and to provide a convenient 1H NMR handle
for characterization. The 31P NMR spectrum of p-tolL2 indicates the presence
of an AB2 system (Δν ≈ JA,B)48 with a coupling constant
of 3JA,B = 155 Hz, as previously
observed for its phenyl-substituted analogue.46 The diphosphine ether ligand PhL3(49) was obtained from commercial sources and used
as received.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of p-tolL1 and p-tolL2 from o-Bromo(di-(para-tolyl)phosphino)benzene
Coordination of the chelating
phosphine ligands to a nickel(0)
center was achieved by reaction with Ni(cod)2 (cod = cyclooctatetraene)
in the presence of benzophenone imine (BPI), in a stoichiometric ratio,
affording respectively complexes (i) [(p-tolL1)Ni(BPI)] (p-tol1; Scheme 2), (ii) [(p-tolL2)Ni(BPI)] (p-tol2; Scheme 2), and (iii)
[(PhL3)Ni(BPI)] (Ph3; Scheme 2). BPI was
chosen as coligand since it binds strongly enough to Ni(0) to prevent
the formation of dimeric species24 but
weakly enough to be exchanged with different types of potential substrates
such as alkenes, nitriles, and alkynes (see below; Scheme 4).

Scheme 2 Ni0–Benzophenone
Imine Complexes
(A) General synthetic route.
(B) Isolated complexes. BPI = benzophenone imine.

NMR characterization of p-tol1 indicates that the BPI ligand is bound in an η1 fashion. The 13C NMR signal corresponding to the
imine appears as a triplet (169.8 ppm,3JC,P = 6.1 Hz) close to that of the free imine at 177.3
ppm, consistent with retention of C=N double bond character.
In the 1H NMR spectra, slight deshielding of the C=N–H proton by 0.24 ppm with respect to free BPI is also in
accordance with η1(N) binding. Moreover, the ATR-IR
spectrum displays a signal at 3152 cm–1 in the region
corresponding the N–H stretch. In contrast, the backbone C=O
moiety is bound side-on: the corresponding 13C NMR signal
appears at 119.0 ppm (t, 3JC,P = 5.1 Hz), considerably shifted from the value of 197.4 ppm found
in the free ligand.25 This large shift
is useful as a diagnostic tool to determine whether the CO moiety
is coordinated to the Ni center. The 31P NMR spectra of p-tol1 consist of a single
singlet signal at 15.5 ppm, indicating that the two phosphorus atoms
are equivalent on the NMR time scale. However, from 1H
and 13C NMR analysis, it appears that complex p-tol1 contains two chemically
different methyl groups from the para-tolyl substituents
(2.01 and 1.91 ppm in 1H NMR, 21.3 and 21.1 ppm in 13C NMR). Therefore, the para-tolyl substituents
belonging to a single P-donor site are not equivalent on the NMR time
scale, which can be used as a secondary indication for ketone coordination.

In a similar fashion, NMR data support η1 binding
of the BPI ligand in the triphosphine complex p-tol2. The 13C NMR signal corresponding
to the N=C bond is a doublet of triplets at 168.9 ppm (3JC,P = 8.1 Hz, 3JC,P = 7.4 Hz). The imine proton appears at 10.25
ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (deshielding of 0.48 ppm compared
to the free BPI ligand) and couples with the phosphorus nuclei (dt, 3JH,P = 3.2 Hz, 3JH,P = 2.7 Hz). The 31P NMR spectrum
is consistent with an AK2 system (Δν ≈
5JA,K)48 with
a coupling constant 2JA,K =
85 Hz. From 1H and 13C NMR analysis, it appears
that the complex contains two chemically different para-tolyl substituents (2.14 and 1.95 ppm in 1H NMR, 21.4
and 21.1 ppm in 13C NMR), as also observed with complex p-tol1.

In the 1H NMR of Ph3, the N–H signal from the coordinated imine appears as a broad singlet
at δH = 9.71 in the expected 1:38 ratio compared
to the aromatic region of the spectrum. The 31P NMR spectrum
exhibits a single resonance at 32.4 ppm. No satisfactory 13C NMR data could be obtained due to the low solubility of the complex
and its progressive decomposition, making the assignment of the binding
mode of BPI in solution uncertain. The side-on binding of BPI observed
in the solid state (see below) may be preserved in solution, in which
case fast rotation of BPI ligand on the 1H NMR time scale
would render the two phosphorus atoms equivalent. The N–H stretch
from the bound imine appears as a broad weak band in the ATR-IR spectrum,
located at 3200 cm–1.

More insights into the
structural and electronic properties of
nickel complexes p-tol1 and Ph3 were obtained by X-ray crystal structure
determination (Figure 4). Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were not accessible with p-tol1 but with the structurally
related complex Ph1, in which the para-tolyl ligand p-tolL1 is replaced by the phenyl analogue 2,2′-bis(di(phenyl)phosphino)-benzophenone
(PhL1).

(Ph1) and [(PhL3)Ni(BPI)]
(Ph3) in the crystal (50% probability level).
Hexane solvent molecules (Ph1) and C−H
hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

In accord with NMR data, the structure of Ph1 (Figure 4; left)
exhibits a side-on bound ketone moiety with Ni1–O11 and Ni1–C71
bond lengths of 2.0217(14) and 1.9760(19) Å, respectively. The
C71–O11 bond length (1.320(2) Å) is found between those
of unbound PhL1 (1.213(3) Å)23 and a C–O single bond (1.43 Å in
ethanol50). The ketone is slightly less
activated than in [(PhL1)Ni(PPh3)],24 which displays a C–O bond
length of 1.310(2) Å, consistent with less pronounced π-back-donation
arising from the weaker donor character of BPI with respect to PPh3. The sum of bond angles (351.3(3)°) around the carbon
atom lies between those expected for sp2 (328.5°)
and sp3 (360°) hybridization at the carbon, in accordance
with the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model. The N12–C12
bond length of 1.289(2) Å is close to the value of a C–N
double bond (ca. 1.28 Å)50 and comparable
to the value found by Zhao et al. (1.294(3) Å)51a for η1-coordination mode in their synthesized
NHC-based nickel(0) complex, [(IPr)Ni(η2-BPI)(η1-BPI)] (IPr = 1,3-bis(diisopropylphenyl)-imidazolium), showing
that the π-back-donation to the BPI ligand is small. Accordingly,
the valence angles around the imine carbon add up to 360.0(3)°.
Finally, the torsion angle (∠Ni1–N12–C12–CPh)
of 20.0(3)° shows that the nickel atom is slightly out of the
plane of BPI, which is probably sterically driven.

In contrast
to that of Ph1, the crystal
structure of Ph3 (Figure 4, right) reveals a trigonal planar complex
in which the imine coligand is coordinated to the nickel in an η2 fashion (Ni1–C37 = 2.018(2) Å, Ni1–N1
= 1.8985(19) Å). The C–N bond axis is parallel to the
metal coordination plane, which is thought to maximize π-back-donation
from the high-lying in-plane d orbital with significant σ*(P–Ni)
character. Accordingly, strong π-back-donation into the π*(N–C)
orbital is evidenced by an elongated C37–N1 bond (1.373(3)
Å vs 1.28 Å50 in the free imine)
and the pyramidalization of the C37 atom, which displays a sum of
valence angles of 355.3(3)°, in line with known η2(C,N)-Ni(0) complexes.51 As expected,
the central oxygen atom from the ligand is not binding to the metal
center (Ni1–O1 = 3.3668(16) Å), as also confirmed by a
Wiberg bond index lower than 0.01 calculated by NBO analysis at a
B3LYP/def2TZVP level of theory. The distance between the nickel and
oxygen atoms is similar to the values reported from Ni(0) complexes
bearing this ligand.52 Finally, the measured
P1–Ni1–P2 bite angle of 108.59(2)° and the Ni1–O1
distance of 3.3668(16) Å are in the same range as those found
for [(PhL1)Ni(Cl2)],24 in which the C=O unit is not bound to
the Ni ion (P1–Ni–P2 112.996(13)°; Ni–C
= 3.4031(12) Å; Ni–O = 3.1012(10) Å), supporting
the use of Ph3 as a model complex for the
unbound state of p-tolL1.

In summary, complexes p-tol1 and p-tol2 are geometrically similar and mainly differ by the central coordinating
unit the ligand (C=O vs P). Complex Ph3 differs in that the central oxygen atom is not coordinated and can
be seen as a structural analogue of the unbound state of ligand RL1 (R = p-tolyl or Ph). Interestingly,
moving from tridentate to bidentate mode is coupled to a change in
binding mode of the BPI ligand from end-on to side-on, which can be
understood from enhanced π-back-donation from a d10 L2Ni fragment (see Supporting Information for more insight by NBO analysis into the different coordination
modes of the imine coligand; Table S8).

Ni(0)–Alkyne Complexes
With complexes p-tol1–Ph3 in hand, their reactivity toward terminal alkynes
was investigated, leading to the generation of Ni–alkyne complexes
[(p-tolL1)Ni(HC≡CPh)]
(p-tol4-Ph), [(p-tolL1)Ni(HC≡CCH2OMe)] (p-tol4-CH2OMe), [(p-tolL2)Ni(HC≡CPh)] (p-tol5-Ph), and [(PhL3)Ni(HC≡CPh)]
(Ph6-Ph) (Scheme 3). Ni-complexes p-tol5-Ph and Ph6-Ph,
bearing phenylacetylene as coligand, are sufficiently stable to be
isolated and are discussed first.

Scheme 3 Ni0-Terminal Alkyne Complexes
(A) General synthetic route.
(B) Generated complexes. p-tol4-Ph and p-tol4-CH2OMe were characterized in-situ in
solution, while p-tol5-Ph and Ph6-Ph were isolated. BPI = benzophenone
imine.

The 31P NMR spectrum of p-tol5-Ph displays two
signals at 78.7 ppm (t, 2JP,P = 35.4 Hz) and at 28.1 ppm
(d, 2JP,P = 35.4 Hz) in a ratio
of 2:1, indicating that the ligand binds in a tridentate fashion.
Two 1H NMR singlets of the same intensity at 2.12 and 1.91
ppm correspond to the methyl group from diastereotopic para-tolyl substituents bound to the same phosphorus atom. A single alkyne
is bound to Ni as indicated by the terminal proton signal at 6.30
ppm, which appears as a doublet of triplets (3JH,P = 25.6 Hz, 3JH,P = 7.2 Hz) and couples with a carbon nucleus at 92.9 ppm in HMQC
(1H–13C). Further confirmation of this
assignment is provided by treatment of p-tol2 with d-phenylacetylene,
resulting in the disappearance of the signal at 6.30 ppm in an otherwise
identical 1H NMR spectrum (Supporting Information; Figure S68 and S76). In agreement with the spectroscopic
characterization, the solid-state structure of p-tol5-Ph (Figure 5, left) reveals a pseudo-tetrahedral geometry
in which the alkyne moiety is coordinated in η2 fashion.

Figure 5 Molecular
structure of [(p-tolL2)Ni(HC≡CPh)] (p-tol5-Ph) and [(PhL3)Ni(HC≡CPH)]
(Ph6-Ph) in the crystal (50% probability level).
Toluene solvent molecules (Ph6-Ph) and hydrogen
atoms (except alkyne) have been omitted for clarity.

Compound Ph6-Ph, supported
by the bidentate
diphosphine ether ligand PhL3, displays two
signals at 29.2 ppm and at 27.3 ppm coupling to each other (2JP,P = 14.0 Hz) and in a ratio of 1:1
in the 31P NMR spectrum. This is consistent with a trigonal
planar geometry in which rotation of the alkyne ligand is slow on
the 1H NMR time scale; warming up the sample up to 100
°C does not result in coalescence of the two 31P NMR
signals. This interpretation is supported by reaction of Ph3 with 1 equiv of the symmetric alkyne diphenylacetylene,
resulting in a symmetrical analogue of Ph6-Ph displaying a single 31P NMR singlet at 28.1 ppm (Supporting Information; Figure S98). The proton
from the alkyne gives a 1H NMR signal at 6.9 ppm, as revealed
by HMQC (1H–13C) and comparison with
deuterated analogue. The solid state structure (Figure 5, right) of Ph6-Ph is in accord with the NMR data and reveals a trigonal planar geometry
with a P1–Ni–P2 bite angle of 104.94(2)°, where
the oxygen atom is not bound to the nickel center (Ni1–O1 =
3.3317(15) Å). The alkyne is bound in an η2-coordination
mode, the C37–C38 axis being in the Ni coordination plane.

While stable tricoordinate Ni(0) alkyne complexes with formally
16 valence electrons analogous to Ph6-Ph are
well documented,53,54 compound p-tol5-Ph represents an unusual example of tetracoordinate,
18 VE Ni(0)–alkyne complex, to the best of our knowledge the
first to be structurally characterized. Spectroscopic and structural
data point toward a considerably weaker activation of the C≡C
triple bond in this geometry (Table 1). First, the 13C NMR chemical shifts of
the two alkyne carbons (δC = 92.9 and 101.0) in p-tol5-Ph are moderately
deshielded in comparison with the free alkyne (δC = 77.5 and 83.3), indicating relatively weak rehybridization from
sp to sp2. This contrasts with a stronger activation of
the C≡C triple bond of phenylacetylene in Ph6-Ph evidenced by the 13C NMR signals from the
coordinated phenylacetylene at 125.7 ppm (C≡C–H, dd, 2JC,P = 40.1 Hz, 2JC,P = 7.1 Hz) and 136.4 ppm (C≡C–Ph, dd, 2JC,P = 38.9 Hz, 2JC,P = 8.4 Hz),
which were assigned with the assistance of APT 13C NMR
and by comparison with the d-phenylacetylene complex.
Second, the acetylic hydrogen signal of p-tol5-Ph (δH = 6.30) is less
shifted than that of Ph6-Ph (δH = 6.9), consistent with a stronger rehybridization toward sp2. Third, the C≡C stretch vibration from the alkyne
in p-tol5-Ph is found
at 1823 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum versus 2126 cm–1 for free phenylacetylene and versus 1749 cm–1 for Ph6-Ph. Finally, the slightly elongated
C47–C48 distance at 1.231(8) Å (vs 1.182–1.190
Å in free phenylacetylene)55 and the
rather large C47–C48–C49 angle at 152.0(6)° are
also consistent with a relatively weak activation of the C–C
triple bond, contrasting with the longer C37–C38 bond length
(1.269(3) Å) and the more acute the C37–C38–C39
angle (144.07(19)°) found for Ph6-Ph.
The C47–C48 bond length in p-tol5-Ph is the shortest we are aware of for nickel(0)–alkyne
complexes. Together, these data suggest that the π-back-donation
from the nickel to phenylacetylene is more pronounced in Ph6-Ph, resulting in a stronger rehybridization toward
sp2.

The observations
made for complex Ph6-Ph parallel those reported
for mononuclear, 16 valence electron, tricoordinate
Ni–alkyne, in which the C–C bond is significantly more
elongated than in p-tol5-Ph, regardless of substituent groups on the alkyne. For example, strong
activation of the alkyne is observed for bidentate diimine and mixed
P,N supported species (up to 1.296(6) Å),9c,53a,53b,53i,53l,53n,53r while bidentate phosphorus ligands
afford C–C bond lengths from 1.260(4) to 1.283(3) Å.52b,53d−53f,53h,53j,53m,53o−53q The substantially weaker rehybridization
observed in p-tol5-Ph can be assigned to its unique coordination geometry (i.e., tetracoordinate
complex; 3 donor ligands; pseudo-Td geometry) compared to Ph6-Ph and the
reported Ni–alkyne complexes (i.e., tricoordinate complexes;
2 donor ligands; trigonal planar geometry). The weak activation of
phenylacetylene in p-tol5-Ph is presumably a consequence of the smaller splitting of the d-orbitals
in its pseudo-tetrahedral geometry (3 donor ligands), resulting in
less pronounced π-back-donation from Ni to the antibonding orbitals
of the alkyne. Similar considerations were used by Lee and co-workers
to explain the rather weak activation of CO2 in the tetracoordinate
pseudo-tetrahedral nickel complex [(PPMeP)Ni(η2-CO2)] (PPMeP = PMe[2-PiPr2–C6H4]2)56 with respect to tricoordinate
Ni-η2-CO2 adducts supported by bidentate
phosphines such as [(dtbpe)Ni(η2-CO2)]
(dtbpe = 1,2-bis(di-tert-butylphophino)-ethane).57

Finally, reaction of the diphosphine-ketone
complex p-tol1 with
terminal alkynes
generally led to a mixture containing the alkyne complex, [(p-tolL1)Ni(HC≡CR1)] (p-tol4-R1; R1 = substituent on the alkyne), the starting
material p-tol1, BPI,
the substrate, and cyclotrimerization products. This indicates that
cyclotrimerization occurs concomitantly with ligand exchange, precluding
the isolation of pure alkyne complexes. Nonetheless, in situ characterization of alkyne complexes was possible. Interestingly, 13C NMR of p-tol4-Ph indicates that the ketone moiety is not bound to the metal center:
addition of phenylacetylene to p-tol1 causes the disappearance of the triplet at 119.0 ppm, characteristic
of the η2(C,O) coordination to nickel and the appearance
of a triplet at 202.7 ppm (3JC,P = 4.9 Hz). In addition, all the para-tolyl groups
in p-tol4-Ph are equivalent
at room temperature, with singlets appearing at 2.00 and at 21.2 ppm
in 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. This is consistent
with an unbound ketone allowing fast ring inversion of the chelate
macrocycle. A single 31P NMR singlet at 33.0 ppm down to
−80 °C indicates fast rotation of the alkyne, exchanging
the two phosphorus atoms on the NMR time scale even at low temperature
(Supporting Information; Figure S59).

The C≡C–H1H NMR signal
of the coordinating phenylacetylene could not be located, presumably
hidden in the crowded aromatic region of the spectrum. In contrast,
the assignment of the acetylic proton of the bound alkyne was possible
in the 1H NMR spectrum of p-tol4-CH2OMe where it appears as a
triplet of triplets at 6.34 ppm (3JH,P = 15.6, 4JH,H =
1.6 Hz) and integrates in a ratio of 1:12 compared to the four CH3 groups of the ligand, confirming that a single alkyne molecule
is bound. The integrals, coupling constants, and multiplicity of CH2 (4.63 ppm, d, 4JH,H = 1.6 Hz) and OCH3 (3.32
ppm, s) of the bound alkyne are in agreement with the proposed structure.
Similar to p-tol4-Ph, both 1H and 13C NMR of p-tol4-CH2OMe reveal that
the ketone moiety is not bound to the metal center: the ketone resonance
appears as a triplet at 203.1 ppm (3JC,P = 4.7 Hz) and the methyl groups from the para-tolyl are all equivalent, with a singlet at 2.03 and a doublet 22.2
ppm (4JC,P = 2.3 Hz) in 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. A singlet 31P NMR signal at 32.7 ppm at room temperature is consistent with fast
rotation of the methyl propargyl ether similar to p-tol4-Ph. However, gradually cooling
the sample down to −85 °C first shows the appearance of
a new unsymmetrical species at ca. −10 °C, as characterized
by two doublets (2JP,P = 23.3
Hz) at 32.1 and 34.1 ppm (Supporting Information; Figure S67). The central signal corresponding to p-tol4-CH2OMe does split
into two new doublets (2JP,P = 23.3 Hz) with a coalescence temperature between −50 and
−60 °C. This indicates that the rotation of methyl propargyl
ether can be frozen on the NMR time scale, but also that two distinct
species are formed at low temperature. This is tentatively attributed
to a secondary interaction of the oxygen atom from H–C≡C–CH2OMe with Ni. In addition, the second species
observed at low temperature may be either a diastereomeric conformer
or an isomeric structure in which the central ketone fragment binds
to the nickel center.

The fast rotation of the alkyne fragment
in complex p-tol4-Ph contrasts with the
observed behavior of the tricoordinate Ph6-Ph. DFT calculations on the acetylene complex p-tol4-H reveal that the rotation of acetylene
is assisted by transient coordination of the ketone moiety to the
Ni center, resulting in a low overall rotation energy barrier of 5.5
kcal/mol (Figure 6).
The first transition state, p-tol4-H(TS1), from the unbound ketone state p-tol4-H to the bound state p-tol4-H(I1), is characterized
by the coordination of the ketone moiety (ν = −113 cm–1; ΔGTS1 = 4.3 kcal/mol)
to generate a four-coordinate intermediate p-tol4-H(I1). The second transition state, p-tol4-H(TS2), corresponds
to the rotation of acetylene (ν = −95 cm–1; ΔGTS2 = 4.1 kcal/mol) accompanied
by partial decoordination of one of the phosphine arms. The low overall
energy barrier of ΔGTS,overall =
5.5 kcal/mol is in qualitative agreement with the observed fast rotation
of alkynes at room temperature. For comparison, a rotation energy
barrier of 25.0 kcal/mol was calculated for the rotation of acetylene
in the diphosphine ether complex Ph6-H (Supporting Information; Figure S112), in qualitative
agreement with the observation of two 31P NMR signals for Ph6-Ph up to 100 °C.

The differences in electronic and structural properties of
Ni–alkyne
complexes p-tol4-Ph–Ph6-Ph were further investigated
by DFT calculations (geometry optimization and NBO analysis), as summarized
in Table 2. The optimized
geometries of p-tol4-Ph, p-tol5-Ph, and Ph6-Ph (Table 2, entries 1–4) are consistent with the obtained
crystal structures in which the C1–C2 bond length, C1–C2–C3
angle and Ni–C1 and Ni–C2 distances calculated for p-tol5-Ph indicate weaker
activation of the HC≡CPh substrate. Accordingly, Wiberg bond
indexes (WBIs) calculated in the NBO basis at a B3LYP/def2TZVP level
of theory show that the binding of phenylacetylene induces a decrease
of the C1–C2 WBI (Table 2, entry 5) from 2.82 to 2.30 in p-tol5-Ph versus 2.20 in p-tol4-Ph and 2.17 in Ph6-Ph. The smaller Ni–C1 and Ni–C2 WBIs (Table 2, entries 6 and 7) of 0.31 in p-tol5-Ph corroborate a
weaker orbital interaction between the HC≡CPh ligand and the
Ni-center in the triphosphine complex p-tol5-Ph compared p-tol4-Ph (WBIs of 0.43 and 0.39) and Ph6-Ph (WBIs of 0.42 and 0.39).

In summary, we showed in this
section that ligands p-tolL1–PhL3 all form Ni(0)–alkyne
complexes with phenylacetylene. The
triphosphine p-tolL2 binds in a tridentate mode in p-tol5-R1, resulting in unusually weak activation of
the alkyne, while PhL3 acts as a bidentate
ligand in the tricoordinate Ph6-R1, in which a strong Ni–alkyne interaction causes a high rotation
barrier around the Ni–alkyne axis. The hemilabile ligand p-tolL1 is able to sample
both binding modes: it binds as a bidentate ligand in p-tol4-R1, resulting in a
similar geometry as that of Ph6-R1, but the observed low rotation barrier around the Ni–alkyne
axis is indicative of the ability of p-tolL1 to transiently adopt a tridentate mode.

Ligand Exchange Reactions on [(p-tolL1)Ni(BPI)]
Having observed that
the ketone moiety decoordinates upon binding of an alkyne to the (p-tolL1)Ni fragment, we
sought to probe the generality of this hemilabile behavior. NMR-tube
experiments showed that the BPI coligand can be reversibly exchanged
with several types of ligands, such as benzonitrile (Keq ≈ 2.7 × 10–3; ΔG298.15 ≈ 3.5 kcal/mol), styrene (Keq ≈ 1.5 × 10–2; ΔG298.15 ≈ 2.4 kcal/mol),
and diphenylacetylene (Keq ≈ 6.1
× 10–3; ΔG298.15 ≈ 3.1 kcal/mol), as depicted in Scheme 4 (see Supporting Information for
more details). The proposed mode of coordination of the benzonitrile
ligand in p-tol7-PhCN relies on DFT calculations, which predict the η2-(C,N) binding to be 9.4 kcal/mol energetically less stable than
the η1-(N) coordination mode (Supporting Information; Table S11). With triphenylphosphine,
the exchange is irreversible. In every case, with the exception of
diphenylacetylene, 13C NMR demonstrates that the ketone
moiety is still bound to nickel (no peaks between 190 and 210 ppm).
The coordinated ketone appears at 120.4 ppm (dt, 2JC,P = 13.8 Hz, 2JC,P = 4.4 Hz) for the PPh3 complex p-tol7-PPh3 and shows
two chemically different methyl groups from the para-tolyl substituents at 1.97 ppm (s, 6H) and 1.96 ppm (s, 6H) in 1H NMR and at 21.2 and 21.1 ppm, respectively, in 13C NMR. Unfortunately for the PhCN complex p-tol7-PhCN and for the styrene complex p-tol7-C2H3Ph, the carbon resonance of the bound ketone could not be
assigned, as the weak signal is covered by those of the substrate
and the starting complex p-tol1. However, for all of these complexes, 1H NMR
shows that the two methyl groups from the para-tolyl
substituents on the phosphine are not equivalent (δH = 2.04 and 2.03 for p-tol7-PhCN, 2.05 and 2.01 for p-tol7-C2H3Ph), which is also indicative
of the pincer-type binding mode of p-tolL1 to nickel, with the central ketone moiety bound, as observed
with p-tol1 and p-tol7-PPh3 and
in opposition to p-tol4-R1. With the diphenylacetylene complex p-tol7-C2Ph2,
the absence of interaction of the ketone is demonstrated by the presence
of a triplet at 198.3 of 3JC,P = 4.7 Hz and with all four C–H3 being chemically equivalent (δH = 1.95; δC = 21.2), similar to the closely related terminal alkyne complex p-tol4-CH2OMe. The difference in coordination between olefin and alkyne complexes
is consistent with alkynes being stronger π-acceptors than olefins
and illustrates the ability of the diphosphine ketone framework to
adapt its binding mode to the electronic properties of a substrate.

Catalytic Comparison
Having shown that the hemilabile
diphosphine-ketone ligand p-tolL1 is able to adapt its coordination mode to a substrate bound
to Ni(0), we turn to its performance as a supporting ligand in the
cyclotrimerization of alkynes. We compare hemilabile p-tol1 with the strong tridentate p-tol2 and the bidentate Ph3 to delineate specific effects of the hemilabile
behavior. In addition, the smaller bite-angle rac-BINAP (PhL4) system was also tested.58 Terminal alkyne substrate with diverse electronic
properties were selected for comparison: first, phenylacetylene (8), as a standard aryl-substituted substrate; second, methyl
propiolate (9), as electron poor alkyne and since its
additional oligomerization into cyclooctatetraene (COT) regio-isomers
is commonly observed;59 and finally, methyl
propargyl ether (10) as an electron rich substrate. The
catalytic outcome of the reaction of these alkynes with 0.5 mol %
of isolated BPI-catalysts p-tol1, p-tol2,
and Ph3 and in situ generated PhL4 catalyst at room temperature was analyzed.
The organic products were separated from the reaction mixture as a
mixture of 1,2,4- (a) and 1,3,5- (b) substituted
arenes, in addition to cyclotetramerization products (when applicable),
COTs (c), in which their relative ratio was determined
by 1H NMR, as described in Table 3. To exclude a particular role of the BPI
or cod coligands, the active catalysts were also generated in situ by mixing p-tolL1–PhL3 with 1 equiv of Ni(cod)2 and 200 equiv of the corresponding alkyne. The reactions
display similar activity as the values reported in Table 3 (Supporting Information; Table S4) and form the same resting states (respectively, p-tol4-R1, p-tol5-R1, Ph6-R1) under these conditions.

a Similar results were obtained
when the active catalysts were generated in situ using p-tolL1 to PhL3, 1 equiv of Ni(cod)2, and the corresponding
terminal alkyne (Supporting Information; Table S4). Yields and ratios were averaged over two runs (Supporting Information; Tables S2 and S3). Yields
are isolated yields. Ratios were determined by 1H NMR.

b For systems p-tol2, Ph3,
and PhL4, only trace amounts of products 10a and 10b were detected in which an accurate
determination of the ratio between the two regio-isomers was not possible.

Mixing phenylacetylene (8) with 0.5 mol % of p-tol1 in toluene at room
temperature for 16 h yields 86.9% of 1,2,4-triphenylbenzene (8a) and 3.2% of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene (8b),
in an isomeric ratio of 97:3. Under the same conditions, the complexes p-tol2 and Ph3 and the PhL4-Ni system afforded
only low yields of 8a: 3.1%, 2.8%, and 4.6%, respectively.
In addition, a lower regioselectivity toward the 1,2,4 isomers of
62:38 and 70:30 compared to the 1,3,5 isomer was observed with p-tol2 and PhL4 + Ni(cod)2, respectively. With the more electron
poor alkyne methyl propiolate (9), the reaction catalyzed
by p-tol1 led to nearly
exclusive cyclotrimerization with the formation of the 1,2,4-isomer 9a in a ratio of 91:7 compared to its 1,3,5 analogue 9b and with a yield of 90.2%. Only small amounts of the cyclotetramers,
tetramethyl-cyclooctatetraene-tetracarboxylates (9c)
are observed, in a ratio of 2:98 compared to the trimerization products.
In contrast, the yields obtained for 9a with the other
catalysts in the series range from 14.0% to 65.0%. More importantly,
catalysts p-tol2 and Ph3 and the PhL4 system
display lower selectivity. The tridentate triphosphine catalyst p-tol2 exhibits a regioselectivity
of 92:8 (1,2,4-/1,3,5-isomer) and produces cyclotetramers in a 22:78
ratio compared to the cyclotrimerization products. The bidentate systems Ph3 and PhL4 are also less
selective and lead to the formation of 9a in 84:16 and
82:18, respectively, compared to 1,3,5-benzene product 9b. The bidentate catalyst Ph3 displays good
chemoselectivity (92:8) toward cyclotrimerization, whereas the other
diphosphine system PhL4 appears to even favor
cyclotetramerization products 9c (35:65). Finally, methyl
propargyl ether (10), bearing an electron rich substituent
was also tested and afforded lower yields than 8 and 9. With the ketone-based catalyst p-tol1, 10 is converted into 1,2,4-tris(methoxymethyl)benzene
(10a) in a yield of 71.6%, and the regioselectivity toward 10a remains high (90:10). Under the same conditions, the other
complexes showed poor activity (less than 1% total yield). Overall,
for the three examined substrates, catalyst p-tol1, bearing the hemilabile diphosphine benzophenone
ligand p-tolL1, was
shown to be more active and more selective toward the formation of
the 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene product.

Additional Substrates
In addition to the substrates
described in Table 3, catalyst p-tol1 was applied to the cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes 11a to 13a with high selectivity for 1,2,4-substituted
benzenes and in good isolated yields (>65%, Table 4). Ethyl propiolate (11) (entry
1) affords triethylbenzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate (11a)
at room temperature. At 50 °C, 4-ethynylanisole (13) produces the desired 1,2,4-cyctrotrimerization product in a lower
yield than the weakly electron-withdrawing analogue 1-ethynyl-4-fluorobenzene
(12), supporting a preference for electron-withdrawing
substrate (entries 2 and 3). The preference for electron poor alkynes
is commonly observed in Ni-catalyzed cyclotrimerization of terminal
alkynes.37m,37v−37y In comparison with the Ni-catalysts reported in literature,37 complex p-tol1 is a competitive catalyst in terms of activity and regioselectivity
(from 90:10 to 97:3). A catalyst loading of p-tol1 of 0.05 mol % mediated the cyclotrimerization
of ethyl propiolate (11) into triethylbenzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate
(11a) in 87% isolated yield, reaching a TON of 1740 after
16 h.

two runs (Supporting Information; Table
S5). Catalytic method A was applied (see experimental
part).

Mechanistic Considerations
The comparison study between p-tol1 and the other Ni-systems
(p-tol2, Ph3, and PhL4) strongly suggests
that the hemilabile π-acceptor moiety contributes to the high
catalytic performance. In this section, the role of the ketone fragment
in the improved catalytic performance of p-tol1 is studied and supported by computational
modeling of some targeted compounds. To address the question, an overview
of the general mechanism in metal-catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] alkyne cyclotrimerization
is discussed first (Scheme 5), followed by differences in reactivity among the three catalysts
tested in the comparison study.

Scheme 5 Proposed Intermediates for the Transition-Metal-Catalyzed
[2 + 2
+ 2] Cyclotrimerization of Acetylene, as Commonly Reported in Literature33
Scheme 5 shows a
commonly proposed mechanism for the cyclotrimerization of acetylene
catalyzed by transition metals.33 For base
metals, most mechanistic studies have been carried out using cobalt
complexes as catalysts.60 From the acetylene
metal complex 14-C2H2, the association
of a second molecule of acetylene generates complex 14-(C2H2)2, which requires an open
coordination site in 14-C2H2. Next,
the oxidative coupling of the two coordinated alkyne fragments from 14-(C2H2)2 gives rise to
the key metallacyclopentadiene intermediate. This step is generally
thought to be rate determining. The metallacyclopentadiene intermediate
can be best described as one of two resonance structures, 14-MCP or 14-MCP′, depending on the nature of metal
complex used. For example Saá et al. calculated that CpRuCl
(Cp = cyclopentadiene)-catalyzed alkyne cyclotrimerization proceeds
via 14-MCP′, while the cobalt system CpCo proceeds
via 14-MCP.60d Late transitions
metals tend to favor the concerted-oxidative cyclization between two
alkynes and the low-valent metal center.60a However, a stepwise zwitterionic diradical pathway, involving the
formation of a σ(C–C) bond and one Ni–C bond cannot
be excluded. When acetylene is substituted, the formation of the substituted
metallacyclopentadiene is of importance as different 14-MCP regio-isomers can be generated. The substituted 14-MCP will thus dictate the overall selectivity toward the product formation
of the 1,2,4- or 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene regio-isomer (more precisely
the transition state TS1 between the bisalkyne and metallacyclopentadiene
intermediate).61 In the last step (insertion
of the third alkyne), different mechanisms have been proposed.62 The insertion of a third alkyne could either
proceed via a Diels–Alder type [4 + 2] cycloaddition, in which
the metal does not participate in the bond formation (Scheme 5, pathway a),60e or with the assistance of the metal, prior to the new C–C
bond formation (Scheme 5; pathway b). 7-Metallanorbornadiene (14-[4 + 2])63 is frequently presented as an unstable species
and immediately collapses to arene, forming a metal–arene adduct.
As regards pathway b, the coordination of the third alkyne is followed
by either migratory insertion (metallacycloheptatriene 14-I) or [2 + 2] cycloaddition (cycloadduct 14-[2 + 2]).
These complexes can also be formed in a concerted way, without involving
the direct formation of an acetylene metallacyclopentadiene complex 14-AMCP, but still with participation of the metal center.
It has also been suggested that an additional pathway could occur
via an intermolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition forming the η4-bound intermediate, 14-[4 + 2]′.60d Pathway a is likely to happen for strong donor
ligands or solvents.60d The insertion of
a fourth alkyne (especially if the intermediate formed is 14-I) leads to formation of COT side products.61a Eventually, the formation of the benzene product happens by either
reductive elimination or ligand exchange of benzene with a molecule
of acetylene (cycloadduct 14-[2 + 2] rearranges itself
prior to the reductive elimination).

In this overall picture,
several effects of the hemilabile π-acceptor
ketone moiety ion complex p-tol1 can be envisioned. First, the hemilabile interaction of
the ketone unit can be thought to facilitate the alkyne uptake, especially
in comparison with the tridentate phosphine system p-tol2. In situ NMR
spectroscopy experiments with the three complexes p-tol1, p-tol2, and Ph3 showed
that the corresponding monoalkyne complexes p-tol4-R1–Ph6-R1 are the resting states of the catalyst in
all cases. For the ketone catalyst p-tol1 and the bidentate catalysts Ph3,
these resting states (p-tol4-R1 and Ph6-R1) are 16 VE species that can readily accept an incoming alkyne molecule,
while the corresponding triphosphine complex p-tol5-R1 is saturated (18 VE). Most
probably, coordination of a second equivalent of alkyne to p-tol5-R1 requires
decoordination of one of the phosphorus atoms, which is likely to
raise the overall reaction barrier and result in lower activity under
the same conditions (Supporting Information; Scheme S4). The unique feature of the ketone unit is that the tricoordinate
alkyne complex can be accessed directly from the tetracoordinate precursor p-tol1. A similar process
can be thought to happen at the end of the catalytic cycle: the ketone
may accelerate product release by transient coordination to Ni(0),
which would explain the lower propensity of p-tol1 to form cyclooctatetraenes.

Second,
the interaction of the ketone with the nickel center could
help to stabilize transient intermediates, such as the key metallacycle 14-MCP species. In order to assess structural differences
between the metallacyclopentadiene supported by the different ligands, p-tolL1, p-tolL2, and PhL3, we made use of geometry optimization by DFT calculation at a B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)
level of theory using acetylene as a model substrate.

Unsurprisingly,
the ketone moiety is not bound in the bisalkyne
diphosphine benzophenone complex p-tol15-(C2H2)2. However, geometry
optimization of the metallacyclopentadiene intermediate formed by
oxidative coupling reveals a pentacoordinate geometry in which the
ketone is bound to the metal (p-tol16-MCP, Scheme 6), suggesting hemilabile behavior of p-tolL1 in the key oxidative coupling step. Respective
Ni–O and Ni–C distances of 1.93 and 1.99 Å, as
well as an elongated C–O bond (1.35 Å), indicate a strong
interaction with the metal center. In addition, a P1–Ni–P2
angle of 171° results in an approximate trigonal-bipyramidal
geometry with apical P atoms. The fact that the C=O unit binds
side-on to a formal Ni(II) center can be surprising at first sight
in view of its low propensity to bind to divalent metal halides.24,25 This can be understood by a synergistic interaction between a strongly
σ-donating bidentate hydrocarbyl ligand and the strongly π-accepting
ketone ligand in the equatorial plane of the trigonal bipyramid.

R = para-tolyl.

For comparison, the geometry of the metallacycles
supported by
the triphosphine p-tolL2 and the diphosphine ether PhL3 ligands were
also optimized (Figure 7). The triphosphine-supported [(p-tolL2)Ni(C4H4)] (p-tol17-MCP) adopts a similar trigonal bipyramid
geometry to p-tol16-MCP. This binding mode may contribute to explain the differences in
reactivity with the rac-BINAP system, for which this
mode is inaccessible. In contrast, [(PhL3)Ni(C4H4)] (Ph18-MCP) exhibits
a distorted square planar geometry, in which the PhL3 is bound in bidentate manner (N–O = 3.20 Å;
WBI(Ni–O) < 0.01). Hence, the metallacycle in Ph18-MCP is not stabilized by its central ether donor
group,64 which may partly explain the lower
regioselectivity of Ph3 is toward the 1,2,4-trisubstituted
arene cyclotrimerization product. Furthermore, no significant modifications
of the P1–O–P2 bite angle from phenylacetylene analogue Ph6-Ph are visible.

step. Comparison of metallacyclopentadiene
molecular structures bearing the p-tolL1, p-tolL2, and PhL3 ligands, optimized at a B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)
level of theory. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity.

At this point, we showed that
the hemilabile character of the ketone
ligand p-tolL1 contributes
to higher activity and selectivity in the cyclotrimerization of terminal
alkynes. The combination of the two effects presented in this section,
that is, decoordination and coordination of the C=O unit to
assist the substrate uptake and stabilize the key metallacyclopentadiene
intermediate, can explain its superior performance. Exchanging the
C=O moiety in complex p-tol1 with a stronger donor atom, like a phosphine group (P–Ph)
or with a bidentate ligand (O as central atom) decreases either the
activity or the selectivity of the overall process.

Therefore,
based on the computational and experimental observations
obtained from this study, a simplified catalytic cycle is proposed
for the cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes catalyzed by the nickel
diphosphine benzophenone system (Scheme 7). The resting state, p-tol4-R1, can be generated
by ligand exchange from p-tol1 or in situ from the ligand and Ni(cod)2 (1). The in situ system and p-tol1 operate at similar rates of product
formation under the same tested conditions (similar percentage of
isolated yields), showing that the dissociation of the coligand (cod
vs BPI) and competitive binding with the metal center does not affect
the final yields, as long as p-tol4-R1 can be formed. At this step, the ketone is
not bound, which facilitates coordination of the second alkyne molecule
to generate Ni-bisalkyne p-tol15-(C2HR1)2 (2). The next
step (3) involves the C–C oxidative coupling, which is coupled
to coordination of the ketone to nickel in η2-fashion.
This interaction may favor the formation of the 2,5-disubstituted
metallacyclopentadiene p-tol16-MCP-R1. The R1 substituents have
been arbitrarily positioned in 2,5 positions as they promote the selective
formation of the 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene. From this intermediate,
the insertion of the third alkyne to form the final benzene product
could go via either [4 + 2] cycloaddition, migratory insertion, or
[2 + 2] cycloaddition, followed by reductive elimination of the trisubstituted
benzene and ligand exchange to regenerate p-tol1 for a new turnover (4). Throughout the
reaction coordinate, the ligand can adapt its geometry by the labile
interaction of C=O to Ni and stabilize intermediates.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported here the synthesis and characterizations
of Ni(0) complexes, incorporating a diphosphine ketone (p-tolL1), trisphosphine (p-tolL2), and diphosphine
ether (PhL3) ligand, in which the binding
mode of the stabilizing imine or alkyne coligand can change according
to the structural and electronic characteristics of the supporting
ligand. The characterization of [(p-tolL2)Ni(HC≡CPh)] (p-tol5-Ph) provides a rare example of weak activation of alkynes
by nickel complexes, attributed to its unique coordination geometry.
We show in this study that [(p-tolL1)Ni(BPI)] (p-tol1) is an effective catalyst in the [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization
of terminal alkynes. In contrast, related Ni(0) complexes [(p-tolL2)Ni(BPI)] (p-tol2) and [(PhL3)Ni(BPI)] (Ph3) are less
active or less selective toward the 1,2,4-trisubstitued benzene cyclotrimerization
product under similar conditions. We attribute the enhanced reactivity
of p-tol1 to the hemilabile
character of its diphosphine benzophenone ligand. In situ NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations suggest that C=O hemilability
may facilitate substrate uptake and assist the key oxidative coupling
step. A more detailed mechanistic study of the reaction and applications
of diphosphine-ketone ligands to other catalytic processes are actively
investigated in our laboratories.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Reagents
Unless otherwise noted, all
reactions were carried out under an inert N2(g) atmosphere,
using standard Schlenk line or glovebox techniques, and stirred magnetically.
Silica gel P60 (SiliCycle) was used for column chromatography.
Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed using SiliCycle
60 F254 silica gel (precoated sheets, 0.20 mm thick) from
Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Deuterated solvents were purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory Incorporation (Cambridge, USA) and
were degassed by standard freeze–thaw–pump procedure65 and subsequently stored over molecular sieves.
Common solvents were purified using a MBRAUN MB SPS-80 purification
system or by standard distillation techniques or both.65 They were degassed by bubbling N2(g) through the liquid for at least 30 min and then stored over molecular
sieves. Non-halogenated solvents were tested with a standard purple
solution of sodium benzophenone ketyl in tetrahydrofuran to confirm
effective oxygen and moisture removal. Other solvents were checked
for water content by the Karl Fischer titration or by 1H NMR. Liquid chemicals were first degassed by standard freeze–pump–thaw
procedures or purged with N2(g) and then stored over molecular
sieves prior to use. Phosphorus-containing compounds were checked
for oxidation by 31P NMR before use. O-(Bromophenyl)-diphenylphosphine,24,47o-(bromophenyl)-di-p-tolylphosphine,25 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzophenone (PhL1),24 and 2,2′-bis(di(p-tolyl)phosphino)benzophenone (p-tolL1)25 were synthesized
according to reported procedures. All other reagents and starting
materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without
further purification, except when specified.

Physical Methods
The 1H, 13C, 31P, and 19F NMR (400, 100, 161, and 400 MHz, respectively)
spectra were recorded at 297 K on an Agilent MRF 400 spectrometer.
All chemical shifts are reported in the standard δ notation
of parts per million, referenced to residual peak of the solvent,
as determined relative to Me4Si (δ = 0 ppm).66 Variable-temperature (VT) NMR were recorded
in d-toluene from −85 °C to room temperature.
Infrared spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FT-IR
spectrometer. For air-sensitive compounds, a N2 flow was
used. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Lambda 35 UV–vis
spectrometer. The UV–vis solutions were prepared in the glovebox,
using degassed and dried solvent, and then stored in a cuvette sealed
with a Teflon cap. The acquisition and analysis of the UV–vis
data were performed with PerkinElmer UW WinLab and UV WinLab Data
Processor and Viewer software. GC-MS measurements were conducted on
a PerkinElmer Clarus 680 GC (column PE, Elite 5MS, 15 m × 0.25
mm ID × 0.25 μm) equipped with Clarus SQ8T MS and analyzed
with TurboMass software. ESI-MS analysis was recorded with a Water
LCT Premier XE spectrometer. Elemental analysis was provided by Mikroanalytisches
Laboratorium Kolbe, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, and Medac
Ltd., Surrey, UK.

Computational Methods
DFT (density
functional theory)
results were obtained using the Gaussian 09 software package.67 Restricted (R) geometry optimizations use the
B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr) functional
and the 6-31g(d,p) basis set on all atoms. The structures were optimized
without any symmetry restraints and are either minima or transition
states. Frequency analyses were performed on all calculations. The
transition states search was performed using the QST3 (synchronous
transit-guided quasi Newton number 3) method. For NBO (natural bond
orbital) calculation, the NBO6 program,68 up to the NLMO (natural localized molecular orbital) basis set,
was used at B3LYP/def2TZVP level of theory from the optimized geometry.
Pictures derived from DFT calculations have been generated using the
GaussView software. The B3LYP functional was chosen as it has been
shown to be accurate for geometry optimization of related metal compounds,69 including closely related PhL1–metal systems.24,25

Under inert atmosphere, [(p-tolL2)Ni(BPI)] (p-tol2) (100 mg, 0.11 mmol), and phenylacetylene (11 mg, 0.11 mmol)
were mixed together and dissolved in dried degassed toluene (5 mL).
The reaction mixture was subsequently stirred at room temperature
for 1 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the crude residue
was dissolved in dried degassed THF (3 mL). Dried degassed hexane
(3 mL) was added, and the mixture was put in the freezer at −35
°C for 16 h, after which a red precipitate was observed. The
solid was isolated by filtration and washed with cold hexane (5 ×
2 mL) to afford p-tol5-Ph as a red powder (59 mg, 0.07 mmol, 66%). Single crystals suitable
for X-ray diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation of a concentrated

In Situ Generation of [(p-tolL1)Ni(C2Ph2)] (p-tol7-C2Ph2) and Keq Determination
for the Reaction p-tol1 + C2Ph2 ⇔ p-tol7-C2Ph2 + BPI
In the glovebox, p-tol1 (4.7 mg, 5.7 μmol) and 1 equiv of diphenylacetylene (1.0 mg,
5.7 μmol) was dissolved in 0.6 mL of C6D6. The solution was transferred to a Young-type NMR tube, and an NMR
spectrum was recorded approximately 15 min after the two reactants
have reacted. 31P NMR was recorded with a relaxation time
of 21 s. For 1H NMR, the singlets at 10.01 ppm (1H), 2.10
ppm (6H), and 1.91 ppm (6H) for p-tol1 and the doublet of doublets at 7.52 (2H) for C2Ph2 were selected to determine the relative concentration
of the reactants. As regards the determination of the concentration
of products, the singlets at 1.95 ppm (12H) for p-tol7-C2Ph2 and
the singlet at 9.82 (1H) for BPI were selected. The same procedure
was repeated at different stoichiometry of diphenylacetylene (i.e.,
50 equiv and 200 equiv compared to p-tol1). 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δH 10.01 (p-tol1, NH, s, 1H), 9.82 (BPI,

13C NMR was acquired in order
to locate the resonances from the carbonyl and methyl groups of the
ligand of p-tol7-C2Ph2. 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δC 198.3 (C=O, t, 4JC,P = 4.7

Catalysis:
General procedure for alkyne cyclotrimerization (Table 3 and Table 4)
Method A
In the glovebox, a toluene
solution (3 mL)
of alkyne was added slowly, within 1 min, into a toluene solution
(3 mL) containing 0.5 mol % of the nickel catalyst (Ni-cat. p-tol1 to Ni-cat. Ph3). The solution was stirred at room temperature
(substrates 8–11) or 50 °C (substrates 12 and 13) for 16 h. The solution was then opened
to air, and the organic layer was extracted with HCl 1 M (1 ×
10 mL) and water (2 × 10 mL). The aqueous layer was washed with
Et2O (3 × 10 mL), and the organic portions were combined
together, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated
under vacuum. The product was extracted with Et2O and filtered
through a silica plug. The final product was dried in vacuo and analyzed
by GC-MS and NMR. The NMR characterization values of the organic catalytic
products were compared with literature. The isomeric ratios were calculated
and are reported according to 1H NMR. The reported values
(yields and isomeric ratios) presented in Table 3 and Table 4 are the average values over two runs.

Method
B
In the glovebox, a toluene solution (3 mL)
of alkyne was added slowly, within 1 min, into a toluene solution
(3 mL) containing 0.5 mol % of the ligand (p-tolL1 to PhL4) and 0.5
mol % of Ni(cod)2. The solution was stirred at room temperature
for 16 h. The solution was then opened to air, and the organic layer
was extracted with HCl 1 M (1 × 10 mL) and water (2 × 10
mL). The aqueous layer was washed with Et2O (3 × 10
mL), and the organic portions were combined together, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The product was
extracted with Et2O and filtered through a silica plug.
The final product was dried under vacuum and analyzed by GC-MS and
NMR. The NMR characterization values of the organic catalytic products
were compared with literature. The ratios were calculated and are
reported according to 1H NMR.

TON Experiment for the
Cyclotrimerization of Ethyl Propiolate
Catalyzed by p-tol1
In the glovebox, a toluene solution (3 mL) of ethyl propiolate
(11, 232 mg, 2.37 mmol) was added slowly, within 1 min,
into a toluene solution (3 mL) containing 0.05 mol % of the nickel
catalyst p-tol1 (1
mg, 1.2 μmol). The solution was stirred at room temperature
for 16 h. The solution was then opened to air, and the organic layer
was extracted with HCl 1 M (1 × 10 mL) and water (2 × 10
mL). The aqueous layer was washed with Et2O (3 × 10
mL), and the organic portions were combined together, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The product was
extracted with Et2O and filtered through a silica plug.
The ratios between 1,2,4- (11a) and 1,3,5- (11b) regioisomers in addition to a minor amount of tetraethyl-cyclooctatetraene-tetracarboxylates
(11c) were determined by 1H NMR in a ratio
of 91:7:2. Triethylbenzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate (11a)
was obtained in a yield of 87% (202 mg, 0.69 mmol).
