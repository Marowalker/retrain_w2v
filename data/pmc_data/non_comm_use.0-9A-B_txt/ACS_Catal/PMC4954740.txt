The overall performance
of a catalyst particle strongly depends
on the ability of mass transport through its pore space. Characterizing
the three-dimensional structure of the macro- and mesopore space of
a catalyst particle and establishing a correlation with transport
efficiency is an essential step toward designing highly effective
catalyst particles. In this work, a generally applicable workflow
is presented to characterize the transport efficiency of individual
catalyst particles. The developed workflow involves a multiscale characterization
approach making use of a focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope
(FIB-SEM). SEM imaging is performed on cross sections of 10.000 μm2, visualizing a set of catalyst particles, while FIB-SEM tomography
visualized the pore space of a large number of 8 μm3 cubes (subvolumes) of individual catalyst particles. Geometrical
parameters (porosity, pore connectivity, and heterogeneity) of the
material were used to generate large numbers of virtual 3D volumes
resembling the sample’s pore space characteristics, while being
suitable for computationally demanding transport simulations. The
transport ability, defined as the ratio of unhindered flow over hindered
flow, is then determined via transport simulations through the virtual
volumes. The simulation results are used as input for an upscaling
routine based on an analogy with electrical networks, taking into
account the spatial heterogeneity of the pore space over greater length
scales. This novel approach is demonstrated for two distinct types
of industrially manufactured fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) particles
with zeolite Y as the active cracking component. Differences in physicochemical
and catalytic properties were found to relate to differences in heterogeneities
in the spatial porosity distribution. In addition to the characterization
of existing FCC particles, our method of correlating pore space with
transport efficiency does also allow for an up-front evaluation of
the transport efficiency of new designs of FCC catalyst particles.

1 Introduction
The
performance of a heterogeneous catalyst is governed by the
complex interplay between the available pore space and the embedded
catalytically active sites.1−4 Reactant molecules travel through the pore space
of a heterogeneous catalyst particle toward the catalytically active
sites to undergo reaction, followed by the transport of the product
molecules to the catalyst particle outer surface.5 Typical diameters of the size of this pore space range,
according to the IUPAC definitions, from macropores (>50 nm) via
mesopores
(2–50 nm) to micropores (<2 nm).6 The accessibility, or ability for reactant and product molecules
to travel through the pore space, is of key importance to the overall
activity and selectivity of a catalyst material, hence acquiring fundamental
knowledge on the pore space of a catalytic solid is of high importance
to researchers working in both academia and chemical industries.3,7−9

Recent advances in analytical methods have
enabled the visualization
in three dimensions of the pore space of catalyst materials. X-ray
nanotomography is able to resolve pore volumes of entire catalyst
particles with a real 3D resolution of ∼100–300 nm,
down to a real 3D resolution of ∼139 nm for small subvolumes
of the particles.4,10−15 A recent example is a X-ray nanotomography study on the effects
of metal deposition on a single fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) particle
with respect to macropore clogging.11 Another
method includes focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM),
which can resolve in steamed zeolite crystal mesopores down to ∼5
nm in diameter,16 while transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) resolves even mesopores down to ∼2 nm in,
for example, thin slices of zeolite powders.17

Without 3D visualization techniques, transport modeling is
based
on continuum models18,19 or statistical models.18,20 The main challenge, however, remains in accurately characterizing
the complex pore structure with a limited number of parameters.21 Direct visualization of the pore space of a
catalyst particle offers the opportunity for quantitative determination
of the geometrical parameters, such as local pore distributions,22 the pore size distribution,23 tortuosity and constrictivity,24,25 and general principles of percolation theory, e.g. via multidirectional
pore-network models.26 The correlation
between such geometrical parameters and the material’s mass
transport ability has been an active scientific topic for over a century.25,27 One of the remaining challenges is incorporating an accurate description
of the hierarchical complex heterogeneous pore space. While geometrical
parameters are useful for assigning classes of porous materials, the
predictive capability of geometrical parameters for the ability to
transport mass without fitting parameters remains ambiguous:28,29 for example, when tortuosity is considered.30,31

In this work we present a generally applicable workflow. In
conjunction
with microcontinuum models21 we foresee
that the workflow allows for multiscale modeling of reaction-diffusion
processes. In the present work, through the workflow, we provide novel
insights into the bulk transport properties of individual macro- and
mesoporous catalyst particles, on the basis of a detailed multiscale
characterization study using the FIB-SEM method. The studied catalyst
particles are used in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). The FCC process
is generally considered as the workhorse of current oil refineries
as it produces, next to gasoline, an important fraction of the propylene
used for making plastics.4,32

The spherical
FCC particles have an average diameter of 50–150
μm, consisting of several components, such as zeolite, clay,
alumina, and silica. The feedstock molecules, such as high-molecular-weight
aromatics and naphthenes most often found in the naphtha fraction
of crude oil, travel through the matrix, i.e. within the macro- and
mesopores, while undergoing precracking, before entering the micropores
of the embedded zeolite crystals. Acidic sites within the zeolite’s
crystalline framework perform the actual cracking process.32 The efficiency of the FCC particle is determined
by the intraparticle (matrix) and intracrystalline (zeolite) transport
ability,33 with the intraparticle transport
ability qualitatively linked to the accessibility of the zeolite component.7,34

We investigated two sets of industrially manufactured FCC
catalyst
particles containing zeolite Y, further referred to as FCC1 and FCC2.
The main properties of both catalyst materials are summarized in Table 1, while further details
on these materials can be found in previous articles from our group.3,35 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal two distinct appearances
(Figure 1), corresponding
to different manufacturing processes. The “skin” around
FCC2 provides a strong attrition resistance, but at the expense of
the transport ability into the particles.36 A reduction in the transport ability is suggested by the pore accessibility
index, as given in Table 1, which is a relative measure of the initial penetration rate
of large nonreactant organic molecules into the FCC particle pore
space.37 In addition, as evidenced in Table 1, the catalytic cracking
conversion efficiency is distinctly lower for FCC2 than for FCC1.
Unfortunately, the transport ability through FCC particles cannot
be derived quantitatively from the nitrogen physisorption and mercury
macroporosity experiments performed. Table 1 clearly shows the differences in mean surface
area and porosity for both FCC catalyst materials, but no actual pore
space morphology can be deduced.25

cracking (FCC) particles under study: FCC1 and FCC2. The scale bars

The developed workflow consists of four phases (Figure 2) and allows characterizing
and correlating the three-dimensional structure of the macro- and
mesopore space of catalyst particles to its transport properties,
taking FCC catalyst particles as a showcase.

Figure 2 Multiscale workflow,
starting from the top left. Phase I involves
measurement of the two-dimensional spatial porosity distribution for
squares with varying dimensions applied to thresholded high-resolution
SEM images. Phases II and III are executed in parallel with phase
I. Phase II, characterization of the macro- and mesopore space in
small (2 × 2 × 2 μm3) FCC subvolumes obtained
by FIB-SEM. Phase III, algorithm to mimic the FCC subvolumes as virtual
volumes, which are suitable for flow simulations. On the basis of
a large number of flow simulations, the transport ability is plotted
as a function of porosity. The scatter plot can be mathematically
described by a probability distribution function. In addition, a percolation
probability is established as a function of porosity. Phase IV combines
the percolation probability, the transport ability distribution, and
the spatial porosity distribution into an upscaling scheme, which
uses an analogue of electrical resistor networks.

Starting with the original spherical particle, phase I is
the measurement
of the two-dimensional spatial porosity distribution using grids of
squares with fixed dimensions applied to thresholded high-resolution
SEM images. Phases II and III are executed in parallel with phase
I. Phase II is the characterization of the macro- and mesopore space
in small (2 × 2 × 2 μm3) arbitrarily chosen
subvolumes of the sample obtained by FIB-SEM tomography. Transport
simulations (finite element steady-state diffusion) through the subvolumes
are computationally expensive. Therefore, phase III applies an algorithm
to simulate these subvolumes in the form of virtual volumes, which
can be processed by standard desktop computers. Percolation (0 or
1) is determined from a large number of virtual volumes, and an average
percolation value (between 0 and 1) is calculated as a function of
the porosity of the virtual volumes, defining a percolation probability
(PP). Likewise, transport ability values resulting from transport
simulations through the virtual volumes are plotted against their
porosity value. From this relationship we want to obtain a continuous
distribution of transport ability values (y axis)
for every porosity value (x axis). Therefore, the
transport ability is described mathematically by a probability distribution
function with the mean and standard deviation as a function of the
porosity. Finally, phase IV combines the percolation probability and
the transport ability distribution from phase III and the spatial
porosity distribution from phase I into an upscaling scheme, applying
an analogue of electrical resistor networks. As a result of this approach,
the transport through (cubic) volumes with equal dimensions as the
original FCC particles can be simulated on the basis of the determined
macro- and mesopore space. From these results we were then able to
provide an explanation for the observed differences in physicochemical
and catalytic properties between FCC1 and FCC2, as summarized in Table 1.

2 Transport Simulations
Transport through FCC particles is
generally described as a diffusion
process.33 Using Fick’s diffusion
law, the dimensionless transport ability σ is defined for steady-state
flow conditions as a ratio of flows: 1  where Φ0 (mol s–1) is the unrestricted flow through a volume with cross section A0 (m2) and length L0 (m), and Φm (mol s–1) is the “measured” or simulated flow through the same
volume (A0L0) (Figure 3). D0 (m2 s–1) is the
diffusion constant of the gas, and Dm (m2 s–1) is an effective diffusion constant.
Furthermore, Lm, τm,
and εm are the effective length, the effective tortuosity,
and the effective porosity, respectively, as discussed below.

Figure 3 (a, b) Transport
ability, defined as the ratio of the unhindered
flow Φ0 and the simulated or measured flow Φm through the porous volume. (b) Example of a virtual volume
generated by the snake algorithm method.

In the case of Knudsen diffusion, the ratio D0/Dm becomes ≠1. Knudsen
diffusion is in effect when the ratio between pore radii and the mean
free path is smaller than 0.1. A ratio greater than 10 is considered
sufficient for pure stochastic diffusion. A transition regime exists
between ratios of 10 and 0.1, where both bulk diffusion and Knudsen
diffusion are combined.38,39 In the case of naphthalene,
assuming a molecular diameter of ∼0.6 nm,40 a pressure of 300 kPa, and a temperature of 500 K,32 the mean free path is estimated to be ∼14
nm, while the pore dimensions are typically on the order of tens of
nanometers (the resolving power in our work is 20 × 20 ×
20 nm3). Although the workflow in principle would be capable
of dealing with Knudsen diffusion, in practice the chosen setup would
require significant changes. Furthermore, we are currently aiming
for a qualitative comparison between FCC1 and FCC2, rather than a
quantitative comparison with the bulk sample measurements (Table 1). Therefore, Knudsen
diffusion is currently ignored, resulting in D0/Dm = 1.

In eq 1, the measured
flow is then defined by an effective cross section Am (m2) and an effective length Lm (m). The ratios A0/Am and Lm/L0 result in an effective porosity εm and an effective tortuosity τm. Much effort
is put into establishing an explicit universal correlation between
the transport ability and geometrical parameters.25,41 Specifically, a correlation is sought among Dm, εm, and τm. The applicable
definitions for εm and τm vary,
adding complexity to the quest.32 Defining
transport ability as a ratio of flows implies incorporating the geometrical
parameters without explicitly separating for example εm and τm, simplifying the relation between geometrical
parameters and the transport ability.

An advantage of our definition
of the transport ability is the
potential for a direct comparison between experimental and theoretical
results. Of eminent importance for our approach is the required steady
state, posing constraints on experiments.28 A comparison of steady-state flow conditions with equilibrated systems42 requires detailed knowledge of the actual pore
space geometry. Dead-end pores are excluded from contributing to the
flow for steady-state conditions but must be taken into account in
equilibrated no-flow systems. As a consequence, correlating steady-state
flow with equilibrated systems is not trivial.

In the actual
FCC process, many different hydrocarbon species diffuse
through the pores, fragments of cracked hydrocarbons, while many molecules
are absorbed into and released from the zeolite domains.4c,4d In addition, coke formation changes the entire pore space of the
FCC particle during the process, restricting or completely blocking
pores.11,15b,15c In principle,
a time-dependent transport ability parameter can be defined; however,
modeling such a time-dependent dynamic process across relevant length
scales is currently beyond the scope of the current research.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Spatial Porosity Distribution
Measurements
of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalyst Particles (Phase I)
Figure 1 shows the
SEM images of the FCC1 and FCC2 catalyst particles, which were recorded
with a scan resolution of ∼6 nm. The SEM images were thresholded
for the porosity. The resolution does not allow for imaging of the
micropores within the zeolite domains. Therefore, the total porosity
of the FCC particles on the basis of the SEM images will not compare
to bulk analyses: e.g., nitrogen physisorption. The resolution is
sufficient to determine the meso- and macroporosity.

In the
following, grids consisting of squares with dimensions of 2 ×
2, 8 × 8, or 32 × 32 μm2 were applied for
each individual FCC particle and the porosity was determined for each
individual square as the ratio of pore area over the total area. For
details we refer to Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information. From the collection of porosity values (from 2 ×
2, 8 × 8, or 32 × 32 μm2 squares), a mean
and standard deviation was calculated, resulting in a table required
for phase IV: i.e., the upscaling routine.

3.2 Pore
Space Characterization of Subvolumes
of Fluid Catalytic Cracking Particles (Phase II)
FIB-SEM
tomography16 and digital postanalysis resulted
in 243 FCC subvolumes of 2 × 2 × 2 μm3 (56
× FCC1; 187 × FCC2), visualizing the pore space with a spatial
resolution of 20 × 20 × 20 nm. Each FCC subvolume consists
of a series of 100 images of 253 × 320 pixels.

With a spatial
resolution of 20 × 20 × 20 nm, micropore space was not taken
into account. Therefore, the flow through the zeolite domains is ignored.
Transport into, out of, and through zeolite domains are important
rate-limiting steps for a complete description of the FCC process.19 In the present work, we are interested in the
overall transport through FCC particles. As transport through zeolite
domains is very slow,43 we neglect its
contribution to the overall percolation (section 3.4) and transport. The selected spatial resolution
and postprocessing are such that percolation of the 2 × 2 ×
2 μm3 FCC subvolumes through the meso- and macropores
is accurately preserved (visual inspection). It is important to note
that not all pore space in one subvolume is interconnected. Isolated
pore space (“not-connected”) was distinguished from
the “connected” pore space. For details of the analysis
methods we refer to the Supporting Information. Examples of the three-dimensional pore space reconstruction for
individual FCC subvolumes are shown in Figure 4 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 Examples of the reconstructed macro- and
mesopore spaces of FCC1
and FCC2 subvolumes of 2 × 2 × 2 μm3. Transport
is assumed to occur in one direction, indicated by the arrows, while
the sides are considered closed, the percolating pore space is displayed
in green, and the isolated pore space is displayed in red. The numbering
corresponds to the numbers in Figures 5 and 6b.

To execute phase III, i.e. creating virtual volumes, two
geometrical
parameters were measured: (1) the connected porosity versus the total
porosity and (2) the heterogeneity of the pore space within each FCC
subvolume. On consideration of the heterogeneity, after identification
of the connected pore space, each FCC subvolume was split back into
the original 100 separate images. The standard deviation of the connected
porosity values found in all 100 images is considered as a measure
of the heterogeneity within the corresponding FCC subvolume.

The connected porosity is plotted as a function of the total porosity,
and the heterogeneity of the pore space of individual FCC subvolumes
is plotted as a function of their corresponding connected porosities
(Figure 5a,b). Both scatter plots indicate strong similarities
between the pore space of FCC1 and FCC2 at a 2 × 2 × 2 μm3 scale. The similarity enables the use of a single algorithm
for generating a pore space in a virtual volume, representative for
both FCC1 and FCC2, which is phase III.

pore space geometries and a comparison

from FCC1 and FCC2, respectively. The numbering corresponds to Figure 4. (b) Same as (a),

subvolumes. (c, d) Comparison between the FCC subvolumes (dark data
points, 243 subvolumes) and the virtual volumes generated by the random
algorithm (blue data points) and the snake algorithm (green data points).

3.3 Virtual
Volumes of a Fluid Catalytic Cracking
Particle (Phase III)
Simulating diffusion through the measured
FCC subvolumes is computationally expensive. Therefore, small virtual
volumes (50 × 50 × 50 voxels) were generated, using two
different algorithms: (1) a stochastic distribution of pore space
throughout the virtual volume, referred to as the “random algorithm”,
and (2) a random walk-like algorithm, referred to as the “snake
algorithm”. Both the random algorithm and the snake algorithm
are able to generate isolated pore space by using periodic boundary
conditions. For details we refer to the Supporting Information. An example of a virtual volume generated by the
snake algorithm is shown in Figure 3b.

A total of 9462 virtual volumes was generated
(4334 × random; 5128 × snake) and were compared with the
measured FCC subvolumes (FCC1 and FCC2 combined) for the connected
porosity and for the heterogeneity of the pore space, as found in
phase II (Figure 5c,d).

The geometrical properties (connected porosity, heterogeneity of
the pore space) of the virtual volumes, generated by the snake algorithm,
are found to be comparable to the geometrical properties of the FCC
subvolumes by visual inspection. As a result, transport ability will
be determined through virtual volumes generated by the snake algorithm.

3.4 Percolation Probability and Transport Ability
Distribution (Phase III)
A volume is either percolating (percolation
= 1) or not percolating (percolation = 0). Percolation was determined
for 10.000 virtual volumes and plotted against the porosity of each
of the virtual volumes. The porosity range (0–1) is split into
intervals of 0.02, and from each interval the average percolation
is calculated. The result is defined as the percolation probability
(PP) (Figure 6a; a plot of the square root of the percolation
probability). For details we refer to the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 (a) Square root of the percolation probability (PP), determined
from virtual volumes generated by the snake algorithm. The horizontal
bars indicate the binning step (Δε = 0.02) of the moving
average. The curve is fitted to the data points (0.09 ≤ ε
≤ 0.39). The percolation probability is one for porosities
larger than 0.4. The percolation probability for ε < 0.09
is rapidly decreasing to 0, as indicated by the gray area. (b) Scatter
plot of the transport ability for the percolating virtual volumes
generated by the snake algorithm. The numbers correspond to the numbers
in Figures 4 and 5, indicating the transport ability determined for
FCC subvolumes. FCC2 subvolumes α–δ are shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. The
insets show the skewed distribution of the inverse of the transport
ability σ–1 for a specific porosity range.

In order to find the transport
ability, flow through percolating
virtual volumes was simulated by a finite element method, solving
Fick’s second law for all voxels, using the Jacobi (iterative)
method, which establishes the concentration levels throughout the
pore volumes. The boundary conditions were as follows: fixed concentration
levels at the entrance (c0) and exit (c = 0) plane, while the four remaining boundary planes of
a cube were closed to transport (Figure 3a,b). When the solution of the partial differential
equation of each voxel becomes stable, i.e. no more (significant)
changes in concentration levels throughout the volume are observed,
steady-state conditions are obtained and Φm is calculated.
Steady-state flow was considered when the difference between Φz=0 and Φz=L0 became negligible (0.01% of the concentration
difference between the entrance and exit planes).

In this way
the transport ability σ was determined for 5128
percolating virtual volumes generated by the snake algorithm and is
plotted versus the connected porosity in Figure 6b. For comparison, the transport ability
of the 12 measured FCC subvolumes (4 × FCC1; 8 × FCC2) is
plotted, indicating a similar scatter.

Our scatter plot for
the transport ability resembles the scatter
plots found for permeability of porous media.44 Other work, based on experimental evidence28 and computer simulations,29 argued that
a “simple and unique relationship” between the transport
ability and geometrical parameters does not exist, although such a
relationship is often suggested in the literature.25,41 To capture the transport ability in a mathematical framework, rather
than an explicit equation, we propose to describe a specific porous
material by a probability distribution function for the inverse of
the transport ability F(σ–1). (Note that, since we explicitly account for percolation, we avoid
the numerical issue of σ being 0.) The insets in Figure 6b show two histograms of 1/σ
for regions I and II of the connected porosity. Despite the skewed
distribution, a standard deviation and mean can be calculated, defining
the probability distribution for the inverse transport ability as
σ–1 ≈ N(a,b2), where a(εconnected) and b(εconnected) are the mean and standard deviation, respectively. It was found
that, when the whole data set was examined, both a(εconnected) and b(εconnected) are best fitted by an exponential function with
a polynomial as exponent (Table S1 in the
Supporting Information).

With a mathematical description for
the percolation probability,
the transport ability distribution, and the corresponding spatial
porosity distribution for the FCC samples in place, it becomes possible
to generate their values in an upscaling routine, which does not require
further full-scale simulation efforts.

3.5 Upscaling
Routine for Translating the Properties
of the Set of Virtual Volumes into a Transport Ability of a Catalyst
Particle (Phase IV)
The upscaling routine combines a number
of virtual volumes into a larger cube of n × n × n virtual volumes. On the basis
of the spatial porosity distribution found in phase I, the porosity
of each of the n × n × n virtual volumes is assigned using a Gaussian random generator.
Subsequently, a random generator determines whether or not the virtual
volume is percolating, on the basis of the assigned porosity and the
percolation probability (Figure 6a). Finally, a transport ability value is assigned
to the percolating virtual volumes using another Gaussian random generator,
based on the assigned porosity and F(σ–1) as found in phase III.

Then the transport
ability of the whole cube of n × n × n virtual volumes is calculated using the
analogue of an electrical resistor network.45 Instead of using the transport ability, we now define a transport
resistance R: 2  assuming c(L0) = 0 (Figure 3a). The advantage
of using a transport resistance is the availability
of the mathematics as applied to electrical circuitries.

Therefore,
the cube of n × n × n virtual volumes is translated into a three-dimensional
resistor network, as shown in Figure 2. Each resistor value is calculated from the average
inverse transport ability value of both neighboring virtual volumes.
Nodes from nonpercolating virtual volumes are taken out of the network,
as well as isolated nodes. Subsequently, an equivalent resistor value
is calculated for the network by Gaussian-Jordan elimination.46 From the equivalent resistor value, a transport
ability for the n × n × n virtual volumes is calculated (eq 2).

Calculating the transport ability
of a sufficient number of n × n × n virtual
volumes results in a new scatter plot of the inverse transport ability
as a function of the average porosity of the n × n × n virtual volumes. Nonpercolating
virtual volumes are considered nonporous. Now a new distribution probability
function F2(σ–1) is fitted and can be used for a second upscaling step.

The
upscaling routine, as described above, can be repeated until
the dimensions of the original object are obtained, as illustrated
in Figure 2.

The current implementation of the upscaling routine implies two
assumptions. (1) No interfacial boundary exists between two neighboring
virtual volumes: i.e., pores are likely to be continuous from one
virtual volume to another. As in practice no pore space is generated
for the upscaling routine, the first assumption is somewhat trivial.

The second assumption is related, assuming (2) that the overall
percolation probability remains unaffected when percolating virtual
volumes are placed in series. This second assumption is likely to
require a future refinement. Although each percolating volume contains
a pathway through the volume, the pathways through the consecutive
volumes may not be connected. Volumes placed in series result in a
percolation probability of less than 1, especially for small porosity
values. An example from FCC2 subvolumes is shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. However, for simplicity,
percolation is considered to be unaffected by the potential discontinuity
of pathways. In support of the simplification is the 3D nature of
the upscaling routine, increasing the probability of percolation.

For each upscaling step, the transport ability was calculated for
10.000 cubes. The virtual volumes generated by the snake algorithm
(phase III) represent 2 × 2 × 2 μm3 FCC
subvolumes (phase II). Therefore, the spatial porosity distribution
(phase I) was determined for 2 × 2 μm2 squares.

Upscaling is performed with cubes of 4 × 4 × 4 virtual
volumes, resulting in a transport ability scatter plot, representative
for volumes of 8 × 8 × 8 μm3.

From
the scatter plot, a new distribution probability function F(σ–1) is derived. For all particles
and all upscaling steps, an exponential equation was found to fit
best, strongly resembling Archie’s empirical law, which describes
flow through porous media.47 The fitting
parameters used are described in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

The upscaling routine was repeated
with another 4 × 4 ×
4 volume, repeating phase I with 8 × 8 μm2 squares,
resulting in a transport ability scatter plot representative for volumes
of 32 × 32 × 32 μm3. As shown in Figure 2, a final upscaling
step is performed with 3 × 3 × 3 volumes, resulting in a
transport ability scatter plot representative for volumes of 96 ×
96 × 96 μm3, close to the FCC diameters.

The upscaling scatter plots for FCC1 and FCC2 are shown in Figure 7 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. The
tables included in the figures provide the input data from phase I,
the porosity distribution.

Figure 7 Upscaling routine for the FCC1 (Figure 1, particle 1) and FCC2 (Figure 1, particle 1) particles.
The
fitting parameters for the consecutive steps can be found in the Supporting Information. The purple data points
are the result of the first upscaling step. The dark blue and light
blue data points are the result of the second and third upscaling
steps, respectively. The mean and standard deviation values are obtained
from the 2D SEM porosity measurements. For a clear display, the horizontal
scales in the graphs are not equal. See also Figure S4 in the Supporting Information.

The first upscaling step for FCC1 (purple data points, Figure 7 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) shows
a horizontal scatter around the mean porosity value of 0.241, reflecting
the heterogeneity across the entire FCC1 particle. The horizontal
scatter for the FCC2 particle (Figure 7 and Figure S4) is significantly
wider. Visually (Figure 1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information),
the FCC2 particle is more heterogeneous than the FCC1 particle, which
results in approximately twice the value of the standard deviation
for the porosity.

Due to the use of random generators, a few
outliers (approximately
0.5%) are found at small values for the inverse transport ability
(1/σ). Because of the small number of occurrences, these outliers
are ignored.

The second upscaling step (dark blue data points, Figure 7 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) resulted in a narrower horizontal
scatter, due to a reduced heterogeneity, a trend continued by the
third upscaling step (light blue data points, Figure 7 and Figure S4). The heterogeneity of FCC1 for the last upscaling step is close
to 0 (the standard deviation is 0.001).

As a consequence, all
of the virtual volumes (32 × 32 ×
32 μm3) were assigned with almost equivalent porosity
values. It is the percolation probability that is effectively changing
the porosity, as nonpercolating virtual volumes are assigned with
a 0 porosity value. As a result of the discretization of space, the
overall porosity of the volume makes a noticeable step with each virtual
volume being nonpercolating (light blue data points, Figure 7 (FCC1) and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The effect occurs
for all upscaling steps but is only noticeable in the case of a very
small standard deviation of the porosity.

3.6 Comparison
among the Transport, Physicochemical,
and Catalytic Properties of FCC Catalyst Particles
The upscaling
routine has been applied to the 10 FCC particles (5 × FCC1; 5
× FCC2) from Figure 1, and the resulting inverse transport ability values are plotted
versus the corresponding overall porosities (Figure 8a). Contrary to expectations, on the basis
of the pore accessibility index in Table 1, the average transport ability of FCC2 is
greater than the transport ability of FCC1 (Figure 8a: the average inverse transport
ability of FCC2 is smaller than the inverse transport
ability of FCC1). However, not yet taken into account was the presence
of the “skin” around the FCC2 particles. In a final
step, following again the analogue of electrical resistors, the FCC2
particles were therefore represented by a single resistor value, while
the “skin” was represented by a sheet of parallel resistors
(Figure 8b). On the
basis of the SEM images (Figure 1), the “skin” has an estimated thickness
of 2 μm; therefore, the characteristics of the 2 × 2 ×
2 μm3 volumes were applicable for determining the
parameters of the parallel resistors. The “skin” was
found to have an estimated porosity of 0.07, again based on the 2D
SEM data, which is very close to the percolation threshold (Figure 6a). Nevertheless,
the fitted equation is used to calculate the percolation probability
of 0.19.

Figure 8 (a) Result from upscaling the five particles from FCC1 and the
five particles from FCC2, shown in Figure 1. The numbering of the data points corresponds
to the numbering in Figure 1 and Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information. Also shown is the average over the five particles for
both types. The internal structure of FCC2 causes less hindrance to
mass transport. (b) The “skin” of FCC2, represented
by a sheet of parallel resistors, with the FCC interior being represented
by a single resistance value. (c) Addition of the “skin”
resulting in a significant difference between FCC1 and FCC2, in favor
of FCC1 in terms of transport ability or efficiency.

The FCC2 bulk resistor represents a volume of 96
× 96 ×
96 μm3. The combined 2 × 2 × 2 μm3 volumes and the percolation probability result in sheets
of 48 × 48 × 0.019 = 437 parallel resistors for each plane.
The mean inverse transport ability (ε = 0.07) is 160 (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which
results in a transport resistance value of 80 per resistor (according
to eq 2). Therefore,
the sheets of parallel resistors have an equivalent transport resistance
of 0.18.

The bulk transport resistance of FCC2 varies from 0.18
to 0.26.
The combination of the equivalent transport resistance of the “skin”
and the FCC2 bulk transport resistance results in a significant increase
in inverse transport ability (Figure 8c). Consequently, the transport properties of FCC2
are significantly poorer than the transport properties of FCC1.

The presence of the “skin” can explain the contradiction
between the lower accessibility and the large mean pore diameter for
FCC2 (Table 1), as
the interior of the FCC2 has a significantly higher porosity (Figure 1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), but
the access to the interior is restricted by the “skin”.
Therefore, the large pores present in FCC2 do not contribute to the
initial uptake. This observation is consistent with FCC1 having a
lower overall porosity and a smaller mean pore diameter but higher
accessibility (see Table 1).

To improve the accessibility of FCC2, adding a few
parallel resistors
with a small resistance value to the sheet of parallel resistors (Figure 8b) would have a significant
impact of the overall or equivalent resistance. Considering the “skin”
of FCC2, one or more highly porous volumes of 2 × 2 × 2
μm3 in the “skin” would completely
overcome the limiting effect of the “skin”, provided
the entire pore space behind the “skin” is interconnected.
This insight offers opportunities for the design of improved FCC particles
with a high attrition resistance.

4 Conclusions
We have developed a generally applicable multiscale workflow for
exploring the macro- and mesoscale pore space of an individual catalyst
particle in a qualitative manner. The approach is based on the use
of a focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) and tested
for two distinct types of industrially manufactured fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) particles (FCC1 and FCC2) containing zeolite Y as active
material as showcases of multicomponent and hierarchically structured
catalyst materials. Both catalyst materials clearly differ in their
overall pore accessibility and catalytic performances, as outlined
in Table 1.35 The first part of the developed workflow characterizes
porosity in 2D from 100 × 100 μm2 areas with
6 nm pixel resolution and in 3D volumes of 2 × 2 × 2 μm3 with 20 nm resolving power, using the FIB-SEM. The second
part of the developed workflow is upscaling, translating relevant
characteristics of the 2 × 2 × 2 μm3 volumes
to the bulk properties of catalyst particles.

The designed and
tested methodology was able to explain the differences
in pore accessibility and related catalytic performances (Table 1) between the two
types of FCC particles, as found by bulk characterization measurements,
including nitrogen and mercury porosimetry.35 Despite a larger BET surface area and a larger mean pore diameter
for FCC2 in comparison with FCC1, the pore accessibility index is
lower, as well as the conversion rate. Through the combination of
2D and 3D analyses and the upscaling workflow, we have shown that
the denser “skin” (surface layer) of FCC2 plays an important
role in the reduction of accessibility and in turn the conversion
rates. Considering the near-surface, pore-clogging metal accumulation
during the lifetime of the FCC particles,11,15b−15d the presence of such a “skin”
is likely to enhance the effect of pore blocking by metal deposition
and therefore accelerate the deactivation of the FCC2 particles in
comparison with FCC1. Potentially, pore blocking rapidly diminishes
the advantage of the proposed highly porous entrances through the
“skin” in FCC2, suggesting a number larger than one
or two highly porous volumes is required for a consistent improvement
of the accessibility during the lifetime of the FCC2 particles. Innovations
in the design of the porosity distribution and the “skin”
and time-dependent structural changes can be directly implemented
in the developed mathematical framework, helping to design catalyst
materials with improved mass transport properties that remain stable
over longer time periods.

Our work shows that heterogeneity
occurs at different length scales
within a single catalyst particle. In addition, the recent work of
Remi et al.48 demonstrated considerable
differences of mass transfer into nanoporous materials such as the
zeolite domains, as well as between different nanoporous materials.
Although working with larger volumes reduces catalyst particle heterogeneities,
e.g. by using representative elemental volumes, a thorough understanding
of the processes and dynamics must take into account these multiscale
heterogeneities. We believe a distribution function would be a native
representation of a complex arbitrary pore structure, as opposed to
an explicit equation with multiple fitting parameters, in particular
when the distribution function is based on 3D visualization techniques.
Consequently, microcontinuum models19,21 could need
to be adapted to accommodate the proposed distribution function in
order to model an entire FCC riser reactor, allowing a direct link
between catalyst design and its effects for the FCC riser reactor
yield. Such lines of thought could be the basis for future research
work.
