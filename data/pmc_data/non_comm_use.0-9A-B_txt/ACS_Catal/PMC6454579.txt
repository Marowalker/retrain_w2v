[Rh(κ2-PP-DPEphos){η2η2-H2B(NMe3)(CH2)2tBu}][BArF4]
acts as an effective precatalyst
for the dehydropolymerization of H3B·NMeH2 to form N-methylpolyaminoborane (H2BNMeH)n. Control of polymer molecular weight is
achieved by variation of precatalyst loading (0.1–1 mol %,
an inverse relationship) and use of the chain-modifying agent H2: with Mn ranging between 5 500
and 34 900 g/mol and Đ between 1.5 and
1.8. H2 evolution studies (1,2-F2C6H4 solvent) reveal an induction period that gets longer
with higher precatalyst loading and complex kinetics with a noninteger
order in [Rh]TOTAL. Speciation studies at 10 mol % indicate
the initial formation of the amino–borane bridged dimer, [Rh2(κ2-PP-DPEphos)2(μ-H)(μ-H2BN=HMe)][BArF4], followed by the crystallographically
characterized amidodiboryl complex [Rh2(cis-κ2-PP-DPEphos)2(σ,μ-(H2B)2NHMe)][BArF4]. Adding
∼2 equiv of NMeH2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution
to the precatalyst removes this induction period, pseudo-first-order
kinetics are observed, a half-order relationship to [Rh]TOTAL is revealed with regard to dehydrogenation, and polymer molecular
weights are increased (e.g., Mn = 40 000
g/mol). Speciation studies suggest that NMeH2 acts to form
the  precatalysts [Rh(κ2-DPEphos)(NMeH2)2][BArF4] and [Rh(κ2-DPEphos)(H)2(NMeH2)2][BArF4], which were independently synthesized and shown to
follow very similar dehydrogenation kinetics, and produce polymers
of molecular weight comparable with [Rh(κ2-PP-DPEphos){η2-H2B(NMe3)(CH2)2tBu}][BArF4], which has been doped
with amine. This promoting effect of added amine in situ is shown
to be general in other cationic Rh-based systems, and possible mechanistic
scenarios are discussed.

1 Introduction
Polyaminoboranes,1−4 exemplified by N-methylpolyaminoborane (H2BNMeH)n, have alternating main-chain
B–N units and are of interest as precursors to BN-based ceramics
or as new unexplored materials that are isosteres of polyolefins.
Since the original report of the synthesis of (H2BNMeH)n by the dehydropolymerization of H3B·NMeH2 using an Ir(POCOP)H2 catalyst
(POCOP = κ3-C6H3-2,6-(OPtBu2)2),4−6 there has been significant
progress in developing catalytic methodologies,7−13 as well as noncatalyzed routes.14 The
accepted overarching catalytic mechanism operates via initial dehydrogenation
of H3B·NMeH2 to form a transient free,
or metal-bound amino–borane, which then undergoes a head-to-tail
BN coupling (Scheme 1). A number of different propagation scenarios have been proposed
for this latter step that show elements of chain-growth,4,10 step-growth,15 or hybrid mechanisms.16 Particularly interesting would be systems that
demonstrate the potential for control17 over the polymerization process, holistically defined by degree
of polymerization (as measured by Mn),
dispersity (Đ), initiation/termination events,
and catalyst lifetime (i.e., TON). While aspects of these performance
criteria have been noted,7−10,15 there is no general
approach to their optimization.

Scheme 1 Dehydropolymerization of Amine–Boranes
We have reported cationic dehydropolymerization
precatalysts based
upon {Rh(Xantphos-R)}+ motifs,18,19 in which the identity of the PR2 group is changed (Scheme 2).9,10,20 When R = Ph (A), medium2 molecular weight polymer is formed (Mn = 22 700 g/mol, Đ = 2.1),
a higher catalyst loading promotes lower Mn, and H2 acts to modify the polymer chain length (Mn = 2 800 g/mol, Đ = 1.8). Although detailed kinetics for H3B·NMeH2 dehydropolymerization were not reported, these observations
were interpreted as signaling a coordination/insertion/chain-growth
mechanism in concert with more extensive studies on H3B·NMe2H.9 There is also a significant
induction period observed (∼10 min). In contrast, when R = iPr (B), H2 and catalyst loading do
not significantly change Mn (9 500
g/mol, Đ ≈ 2.8), there is a negligible
induction period, and a dual role11,12 for the organometallic
species was proposed in which dehydrogenation/propagation occurs from
different metal centers. This mechanistic switch may be influenced
by the preferred ligand-coordination modes:21 Xantphos-Ph is a hemilabile ligand preferring to coordinate cis-κ2-PP and mer-κ3-POP, while Xantphos-iPr prefers mer-κ3-POP (Figure S1 compares
coordination modes for crystallographically characterized Xantphos-R
complexes).

Scheme 2 Comparison of Previously Reported Rh–Xantphos-Based
Catalysts
and Their Performance in Dehydropolymerization of H3B·NMeH2; [BArF4]− Anions
Not Shown
We now report a detailed
and systematic study on the dehydropolymerization
of H3B·NMeH2 using a different Rh-POP-based
system: {Rh(DPEphos)}+ [DPEphos = bis(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)ether].
Using this ligand, which favors cis-κ2-PP coordination (Figure S1), significant
control over Mn by both catalyst loading
and H2 is achieved, with Mn ranging from 5 500 to 40 000 g/mol and Đ = 1.5–1.8. These studies also reveal the formation of dimeric
species, and the key role of added amine, NMeH2, in both
promoting catalysis and increasing Mn/lowering Đ of the isolated polymer. Finally, combining these
observations, the synthesis and evaluation in catalysis of a simple
[Rh(κ2-PP-DPEphos)(NMeH2)2]+ precatalyst is reported. This positive influence of added
amine is also shown to be general for other previously reported cationic
Rh-based systems. The role of added amine has been recently noted
with regard to increasing catalyst lifetime of Ru-based catalysts
for the dehydropolymerization of H3B·NH3 by trapping BH3 formed from B–N bond cleavage,8 although the influence of amine on the characteristics
of the polymer produced were not commented upon.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Precatalyst Synthesis
Precatalyst 2a, [Rh(κ2-P,P-DPEphos){η2η2-H2B(NMe3)(CH2)2tBu}][BArF4]
(ArF = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3), is synthesized from hydroboration of tbutylethene
(TBE)
by H3B·NMe3 using the NBD precursor 1a (NBD = norbornadiene), preactivated by H2 (Scheme 3). Spectroscopic
data for purple 2a are similar to the previously reported
Xantphos-Ph derivative, A.22 In particular, a single environment is observed in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum [δ 40.0 ppm, J(RhP) = 180 Hz], the 3-center, 2-electron Rh···H–B
groups are observed at δ −5.55 ppm (2 H) in the 1H NMR spectrum, while the 11B NMR spectrum shows
a characteristically23 downfield-shifted
resonance [δ 33.3 ppm], indicating a bidentate binding mode
of the borane. The amine–borane in 2a is easily
displaced, and the [Rh(Xantphos-Ph)]+ analogue (A) has been shown to be active for H3B·NMeH2 dehydropolymerization,9 TBE hydroboration
using H3B·NMe3,24 and B–B homocoupling.22

2.2 Dehydropolymerization
of H3B·NMeH2: Variation of Conditions
Precatalyst 2a is an effective for dehydropolymerization,
and full conversions
of H3B·NMeH2 are obtained even at low loadings
under a slow stream of Ar to remove H2 (e.g., 0.223 M H3B·NMeH2, [2a] = 0.1 mol %, TON
= 1000, 6 h). Variation of precatalyst loadings between 0.2 and 1
mol % reveals an inverse relationship between Mn of the isolated polymer and catalyst loading (Table 1, entries 1–3, and Figure 1A). The resulting 11B NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures and isolated polymer show
the characteristic2,12 broad signal at δ −6
ppm for (H2BNMeH)n and only
trace (HBNMe)3 (Figure S18).
The 13C{1H} NMR spectra (H8-THF)
show a relatively sharp peak at δ 35.5 ppm (NMe). In contrast,
at 0.1 mol % catalyst loading, Mn does
not increase compared to 0.2 mol %, and there is significant 1,2-F2C6H4 insoluble polymer that is tetrahydrofuran
(THF)-soluble. NMR spectroscopic analysis of this material (Figure S19) showed additional signals at δ(11B) ∼1 ppm and δ(13C{1H})
∼35.7 ppm (br, NMe) that may signal tertiary or quaternary
main-chain centers, suggesting cross-linking/chain branching.10,11,19,25 While we currently have no explanation for this change in polymer
characteristics, at these very low loadings trace impurities (or products
of B–N bond cleavage, vide infra) may have a disproportionate
effect on the polymerization process, leading to a different product
being formed. When dehydropolymerization was conducted under H2 measurement conditions (eudiometer, H2 established
in the head space), or in a closed system that allows for H2 buildup, H2 likely acts as a chain-transfer/termination
agent and significantly shorter polymer is isolated, for which 
a significantly larger signal at δ(11B) ∼−18
ppm is observed, which could be assigned to BH3 end groups15 (Figure 1B; Figure S20 shows a representative 11B NMR spectrum). Similar Đ are retained
compared with the open system, as is the inverse relationship between Mn and catalyst loading  (Table 1, entries 5–8). Interestingly,
there is now a significant difference in Mn between 0.1 and 0.2 mol %, suggesting that H2 modifies
the influence of the very low catalyst loading. A conversion versus Mn study (0.2 mol %, open system, Figure 1C) indicates that a chain-growth
mechanism is operating, because at low (10%) conversions long polymer
chains are observed (Mn = 24 800
g/mol, Đ = 1.2) and H3B·NMeH2 monomer dominates (Figure S21).

We have previously, but briefly, reported similar control
of molecular
weight by catalyst loading and H2 for catalyst A and suggested a coordination/dehydrogenation/insertion/chain-growth
mechanism for the dehydropolymerization, in which the same metal center
both dehydrogenates an amine–borane and promotes propagation.9 This more comprehensive data with 2a supports a similar mechanism in the {Rh(DPEphos)}+ system.
That H2 acts to modify the polymer chain may arise from
chain-termination/transfer by hydrogenolysis of a Rh–BH2(polymeryl) or Rh–NMeH(polymeryl) bond. The use of
H2 as a chain-termination agent in olefin polymerization
is well-established, operating through sigma-bond metathesis of [M]-CH2-polymeryl with H2 to form a metal hydride and
free polymer.26 The inverse relationship
between Mn and catalyst loading suggests
dehydropolymerization at a single metal center, as lower catalyst
loadings lead to less propagating sites for the concomitantly formed
H2B=NMeH. Interestingly, this relationship between Mn and initiating sites is also reminiscent of
a classical radical polymerization mechanism where the net order in
initiator is negative,27 as has been recently
noted.3

2.3 Speciation
Experiments: The Formation of Dimeric
Rh2 Species
With the polymer growth kinetics in
hand, we turned to identifying the species that formed during catalysis
using NMR spectroscopy. The low catalyst loadings used for polymerization
(0.1–1 mol %) meant that these speciation studies were performed
instead at 10 mol % 2a to obtain good signal/noise (sealed
NMR tube, 1,2-F2C6H4). Under these
in situ conditions, 11B NMR spectroscopy showed the formation
of a mixture of (H2BNMeH)n,
(HBNMe)3, and (H2B)2(μ-H)(NMeH)
[td, δ −22.3 ppm28], with
the latter potentially signaling free BH3 by loss of amine. 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy under these conditions
showed the initial formation, after 5 min, of two new dimeric complexes:
a bridging hydrido-aminoborane 3a, [Rh2(DPEphos)2(μ-H)(μ-H2B=NHMe)][BArF4], and an amidodiboryl 4a, [Rh2(κ2-P,P-DPEphos)2(σ,μ-(H2B)2NHMe)][BArF4] (Figure 2A). After 2 h 4a is dominant (80%), but the mixture slowly returns to favoring 3a after 5 h (Figure S22). Complex 3a can be prepared as the only organometallic species by addition
of H2/2 equiv of H3B·NMeH2 to 1a. Boronium [BH2(NMeH2)2]+ [δ −7.1 ppm, J(BH) =
110 Hz, cf. authentic sample δ −7.4 ppm, J(BH) = 117 Hz, 1,2-F2C6H410] is also observed under these conditions,29 in line with the reported mechanism for the
formation of analogous complexes with [Rh2(R2P(CH2)nPR2)2(μ-H)(μ-H2B=NR′2)]+ motifs.30,31 Here, attack of free
amine (from B–N bond cleavage32)
at a precursor σ-amine–borane complex generates a neutral
dimeric Rh–hydride and [BH2(NMeH2)2]+, for which subsequent proton transfer and NMeH2 loss result in the bridging amino–borane motif. NMR
and ESI–MS data for 3a are fully consistent with
its formulation (Supporting Materials) and
are very closely related to  previously reported [Rh2(iPr2P(CH2)3PiPr2)2(μ-H)(μ-H2B=NH2)][BArF4].30 Attempts to characterize these products using single-crystal X-ray
diffraction were frustrated by the formation of oily materials. The
identity of 4 was only revealed  using the [Al(OC(CF3)3)4]− anion,33 by a single-crystal study of 4b, [Rh2(κ2-P,P-DPEphos)2(σ,μ-(H2B)2NHMe)][Al(OC(CF3)3)4], which comes from a slow (days) recrystallization of 3b, formed in situ from [Rh(κ2-P,P-DPEphos)(NBD)][Al(OC(CF3)3)4] 1b /H3B·NMeH2 activated with H2 (Figure 2B). 4b is not isolated pure, formed alongside 3b (∼5%
by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy) and (H2BNMeH)n. The NMR data for 4b, aside from the signals due to the anion, are the same as for 4a, as are the ESI–MS data.

Figure 2 (A) Addition of H3B·NMeH2 to 2a (10 mol %) to form 3a and 4a, 1,2-F2C6H4 solvent. (B) Synthesis and solid-state
structure of the cationic portion of 4. Selected
bond lengths (Å) and angles (deg): Rh1–Rh2 2.6421(4);

1.59(1), B2–N1 1.56(1); P1–Rh1–Rh2 162.59(3),
P2–Rh1–Rh2, 95.31(3).

The structure of the cation in 4b has a Rh2 core [Rh–Rh 2.6421(4) Å] with a bridging amido–bisboryl
ligand that has two α-BH···Rh agostic interactions
with the proximal Rh centers [e.g., Rh2–B1 2.107(5), Rh1···B1
2.326(5) Å]. Such a description results in formally Rh(II) centers
with a Rh–Rh bond accounting for the diamagnetism. An alternative
description of the bonding in 4b is a diborylmethylammonium
complex that would result in the Rh centers being formally Rh(0).
The DPEphos ligand adopts a κ2-PP motif, with two
of the phosphines (P2, P3) trans to the BH agostic interaction and
cis to the Rh–Rh bond, while P1 and P4 lie trans to the Rh–Rh
bond and couple to both Rh centers in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum [e.g., J(RhP) = 139, 102 Hz]. The
four 31P environments are chemically inequivalent. There
is no evidence for a Rh–H–Rh bridging hydride (NMR,
ESI–MS), and the α-BH···Rh are observed
as two broad doublets at δ −8.86 and −9.44 ppm
[J(PH) ≈ 70 Hz] in the 1H{11B} NMR spectrum.34 The 11B NMR spectrum shows a broad signal at δ 9.4 ppm. These data
show that the solid-state structure is retained in solution. As the
NMeH group forces C1 symmetry in the molecule,
this also shows that the amido–bisboryl ligand is not undergoing
rapid and reversible dissociation or hydride fluxionality. A Quantum
Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) study of the bonding in the cation
of 4b (Figure 3) indicates a Rh–Rh interaction, with the presence
of a bond path and bond critical point (BCP) between Rh1 and Rh2.
BCPs are also present between Rh1–HAB1 and Rh2–HCB2, giving evidence for the α-BH···Rh
agostic interactions. This is supported, for example, through examination
of the BCP metrics of bridging B1–HA/B2–HC, which show a weaker (lower electron density, ρ(r), and total energy density, H(r)) B–H bond with less symmetrical bonding (larger
ellipticity, ε) than for terminal B1–HB/B2–HD, as expected for B–H bonds involved in agostic interactions.
Comparatively weak CH···Rh agostic interactions (ρ(r) = 0.02, H(r) = 0.00)
between phenyl groups and each Rh center are also observed in the
QTAIM analysis and also observed experimentally, e.g., Rh1···C38,
2.997(5) Å. Consistent with such interactions, a broad asymmetric
signal is observed at δ 3.94 ppm (2 H) in the 1H
NMR spectrum of 4b that is attributed to agostic Rh···HCphenyl interactions, similar to that observed in [Ru(PiPr3)2(H)(H2)(C6H5C5H4N)][BArF4] (δ 4.14 ppm).354b is a rare example of a complex with both C–H and B–H
agostic interactions.36,37

Related structures to 4b that show bridging
“BNB”,20,38 α-BH···Rh
agostic,39 or amino–boryl motifs9,40 have been reported
before. However, as far as we are aware, the amido–bisboryl
structure is a new motif in metalloborane chemistry. Perhaps most
closely related to 4b is a Rh-dimer with P–C activated
Xantphos-Ph ligands and a bridging N,N-dimethylaminodiboranate unit ([H3BNMe2BH3]−) that is isolated at the end of dehydrocoupling
of H3B·NMe2H when using catalyst A. Interestingly, this is also a competent catalyst for H3B·NMeH2 dehydropolymerization.20 While we currently can only speculate on the
mechanism of formation of 4, it is connected to 3 by simple addition of BH3 and loss of H2. Under catalytic conditions 3 likely forms first, while
the role of 4 is less clear. To help resolve the identity
of the active species in catalysis, kinetic studies were undertaken,
taking 2a, 3a, and 4b as precatalysts.

2.4 Kinetic Studies of Dehydropolymerization As
Followed by H2 Evolution
The kinetics of dehydropolymerization
were followed by volumetric studies of H2 generation using
a eudiometer. In all cases ∼1.1 equiv of H2 was
measured and very little N-trimethylborazine was
observed by 11B NMR spectroscopy (<5%, Figure S23), indicating that evolved H2 is a good
proxy for transient41 H2B=NMeH
equivalents formed and subsequent polymer chain growth. A significant
induction period was observed prior to faster turnover (e.g., ∼60
min, 0.4 mol %), that gets longer with increase in
[2a]0 (Figures 4A and S24; e.g., 0.1 mol
%, tind = 33 min; 1 mol %, tind = 110 min). An induction period has also been noted
for catalyst A in H3B·NMeH2 dehydropolymerization9 as well as for
[Rh(Ph2P(CH2)3PPh2)(FC6H5)][BArF4], C, in H3B·NMe2H dehydrocoupling (10 and
5 min, respectively, at 0.2 mol %).42 For
this latter system, increased [Rh]TOTAL also led to longer
induction periods, and a subsequent study showed the initial formation
of an amino–borane-bridged dimer analogous to 3a.30 While the observation of an induction
period might suggest a heterogeneous system here,43−45 addition of
excess Hg or substoichiometric PPh3 during productive turnover
did not significantly reduce reaction rate, and no darkening of the
reaction was noted, pointing toward homogeneous catalysis (Figure S25). Overall, the kinetics evolve in a
sinusoidal manner, with a rate maximum reached approximately at the
midpoint (e.g., 0.4 mol %, νmax = 4.1(2) × 10–5 M s–1). This behavior is suggestive
of a long induction period coupled to rate-attenuation as the substrate
is depleted. There is a noninteger dependence of the maximum rate
on the initial catalyst concentration (Figure S28), which hints at more complex kinetics. Using 0.223 M D3B·NMeH2 or H3B·NMeD2 at
0.4 mol % 2a, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) determined
from νmax were k(BH)/k(BD) = 1.1 ± 0.1 and k(NH)/k(ND) = 2.2 ± 0.1, which suggests that N–H bond cleavage
is involved in the turnover-limiting step. These data are very similar
to those measured for A.9 The
polymerization is not living as recharging 2a gives approximately
the same Mn, at a similar rate for second
recharge (Figure S31). A short induction
period was noted for each recharge, which reflects the reformation
of 3a at the end of catalysis (vide infra).

Figure 4 H2B=NMeH equivalents from H2 evolution

°C). Each set of comparative runs used the same batch of solvent
and H3B·NMeH2. (A) [2a] =
0.4 and 1 mol % Rh and 0.4 mol % + 1 equiv of H3B·THF;
(B) 2a, 3a, and 4b at 0.4 mol
% [Rh]TOTAL, kobs measured
for [4b]. (C) [Rh]TOTAL versus kobs using 4b as a catalyst.

Use of in situ generated dimeric 3a leads to a shorter,
but still significant, induction period (∼30 min, Figure 4B) and a similar
profile and rate maximum as for 2a. In contrast, reaction
of crude 4b resulted in no detectable induction period.
Furthermore, H2 evolution (a proxy for H2B=NMeH
formation) followed a first-order profile (Figure 4B, kobs = 3.2(1)
× 10–4 s–1), and this allowed
for a half-order dependency on initial catalyst concentration, i.e.,
[Rh]TOTAL, to be estimated (Figures 4C and S30).

The polymers isolated from these H2 evolution studies
using 3a and 4b are similar by GPC analysis
but slightly longer compared to that from 2a at equivalent
[Rh]TOTAL (Table 1, entries 7, 9, and 10). Speciation studies at 1 mol
% 2a return only 3a at the end, which suggests
that, if formed, 4a must be consumed under the conditions
of catalysis. Overall these data show the following: a change in H2-evolution kinetics on moving from 2a (complex)
to 4 (pseudo first-order), that 4 likely
sits close to the actual catalyst, and that 3 still requires
an induction process to bring it on-cycle. The approximately half-order
dependence in [Rh]TOTAL when using 4a as a
precatalyst suggests a lower-order (ligation or nuclearity) active
catalyst that is in a rapid equilibrium with a higher-order inactive
species, as is discussed later.

2.5 Kinetic
Studies: Doping Experiments and the
Promoting Effect of NMeH2
Seeking to understand
the observed kinetics, and in particular the underlying reason for
the induction period, the influence of various species that may be
present, or formed, during catalysis was examined. Addition of 1 equiv
of H3B·THF (in 50 μL of THF) to 0.4 mol
% [2a]/H3B·NMeH2/1,2-F2C6H4 solvent increased the induction
period significantly (Figure 4A) and gave significantly shorter polymer (Table 1, entry 11), while 10 equiv
halts catalysis, possibly by the formation of inactive boron-rich
species (see Supporting Information).32 Added [H2B(NMeH2)2][BArF4] (10 equiv) significantly slows
catalysis, now taking 24 h for completion to produce very short polymer
(Mn = 2 800 g/mol, Đ = 2.3). This argues against its role in productive catalysis, in
contrast with other systems,10,29,46 in particular the [Rh(Xantphos-iPr)]+ system,
where it promotes catalysis.10 At low relative
concentrations, H3B·THF presumably acts to titrate
out NMeH2, while we propose that excess [H2B(NMeH2)2]+ acts to poison catalysis, possibly
sequestering NMeH2 via N–H···NMeH2 hydrogen bonding, as noted for related bis(phosphine)boronium
salts.47 The control experiment of THF
addition (50 μL) reduced the induction period to 30 min and
produced polymer comparable to nondoped experiments (Table 1, entry 13). The most dramatic
change came from addition of ∼2 equiv of NMeH2 (in
50 μL of THF) to 0.4 mol % [2a]/H3B·NMeH2. This resulted in a kinetic profile for H2 evolution
that now showed no induction period and pseudofirst-order kinetics
for hydrogen evolution (kobs = 3.7(1)
× 10–4 s–1), similar to that
of 4b at the same [Rh]TOTAL. Isolated polymer,
however, was considerably longer (Mn =
27 400 g/mol, Đ = 1.9) than for when
just 2a was used. As expected, under open conditions Mn increases (Mn =
32 100 g/mol, Đ = 1.6), albeit to a
lesser extent than compared with the analogous nondoped experiments
(cf. entries 14/15 and 2/7, Table 1). These observations, alongside the speciation data
at 10 mol %, which demonstrate that 3a is likely the
first formed species, show that free NMeH2 formed from
B–N bond cleavage is key to not only bringing the catalyst
on-cycle but also promoting propagation or attenuating chain-transfer/termination,
leading to higher molecular weights of isolated polymer. Given these
observations, the role of NMeH2 was next investigated.

2.6 Rh–Amine Adducts As Effective Precatalysts
We first sought to understand the likely species generated in situ
by addition of amine to the precatalyst, 2a. Addition
of ∼2 equiv of NMeH2 (in THF) to 2a gave the simple bisamine complex [Rh(κ2-P,P-DPEphos)(NMeH2)2][BArF4], 6, which reacts rapidly (on time of mixing) with H2 in
situ to form the corresponding dihydride [Rh(κ2-P,P-DPEphos)(H)2(NMeH2)2][BArF4], 5 (Scheme 4). Complex 5 reversibly, but slowly, loses H2 under extended degassing to reform complex 6, and thus we suggest that, under the conditions of dehydropolymerization, 5 would be persistent. NMR spectroscopic data are fully consistent
with the proposed structures (see later), but under these conditions
of synthesis isolating pure samples of 5 and 6 in bulk has proved difficult; and a 1:1 mixture of 5/6 is conveniently prepared from 1a/∼2
× NMeH2/H2/degas and used directly in catalysis
(see Supporting Information). Complex 5 is the sole organometallic product on addition of ∼2
equiv of NMeH2 to a 1:3 mixture of 3a/4a, alongside HB(NMeH)2 [δ(11B) 28.6 ppm, J(BH) = 127 Hz], demonstrating the
role of NMeH2 in both generating 3, via boronium
formation,29,30 and bringing dimeric 3 and 4 back to monometallic species. Complex 6 (and 5 on subsequent addition of H2 in solution)
can be prepared as a free-flowing pure solid in bulk via an alternative
route, from addition of NMeH2 to [Rh(κ2-P,P-DPEphos)(η6-o-Me2C6H4)][BArF4], 7,48 which enables  definitive
characterization by NMR spectroscopy. However, this involves laborious
multiple triturations with cold pentane, and thus, the in situ prepared
mixture is more convenient to use. Notable NMR spectroscopic data
for 6 are the observation of equivalent NMeH2 groups in the 1H NMR spectrum, while for 5 addition of H2 makes these groups inequivalent and diastereotopic;
two Rh–H environments are observed, one of which shows a large
trans coupling to 31P [J(HP) = 182 Hz],
and inequivalent phosphorus environments are observed in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum (Supporting
Information). Data from H2-evolution kinetics and
isolated polymer using isolated 6 fit well with the trends
apparent from using the 5/6 in situ mixture
(Table 1 and Figure 5).

Using in situ generated 5/6 gave pseudo
first-order plots for H2 evolution (e.g., 0.4 mol %, kobs = 4.1(1) × 10–4 s–1) with no induction period observed. These were also
half-order in [Rh]TOTAL (Figure 5A). Half-order behavior is indicative of
either a rapid equilibrium between species of different nuclearity,
e.g., monomer–dimer, prior to the turnover-limiting step, in
which the higher nuclearity species is inactive but dominant,49 or the rapid and reversible dissociation of
a ligand that reveals a low concentration of an active species.50 Monomer/dimer equilibria have been proposed
in polymerization systems previously,51−53 and in amine–borane
dehydrocoupling specifically.49,54,55 While addition of 10 equiv of NMeH2 caused no significant
change in rate (kobs = 4.2(1) × 10–4 s–1), suggesting that NMeH2 dissociation is not occurring, the polymer isolated from
this experiment was insoluble in THF. We thus cannot rule
out a change in mechanism. We discount rapid and reversible H2 loss as the reason for the observed half-order kinetics because
under conditions of measurement H2 effectively becomes
saturated and constant. Speciation studies with excess NMeH2 (10 equiv, [Rh]TOTAL = 5 mol %) revealed 5 to be the only observed organometallic species. No significant change
in kinetics was observed on addition of excess Hg, or 0.2 equiv of
PPh3, during catalysis—suggesting a homogeneous
system.56 The use of these in situ prepared
amine complexes 5/6 leads to polymer with
greater Mn (but still inverse with regard
to [Rh]TOTAL), while Đ is kept relatively
low (Figure 5B, e.g.,
1 mol %, Mn = 20 600 g/mol, Đ = 1.5). Thus, the added amine—whether bound
or free—not only brings the catalyst onto cycle but also promotes
greater apparent degrees of polymerization. Whether this is by faster
propagation or attenuation of termination is not currently known.

Following catalysis by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy
using pure 5 (1 mol %) showed that during productive
catalysis a single organometallic species is observed (albeit with
low signal-to-noise) as a doublet at δ 41 ppm [J(RhP) = 150 Hz], which slowly resolves to complex 3 at
the end of catalysis. Importantly, the same species is observed when
starting with precatalyst 4b (0.5 mol %, 1 mol % [Rh]TOTAL). This strongly suggests that both precatalysts evolve
to a common species—the identity of which remains to be resolved.

Interestingly, the promoting effect of NMeH2 is not
operative in the [Rh(Xantphos-iPr)(H)2]+ system,10 which is suggested to
involve a different mechanism, where dehydrogenation and chain propagation
occur at different metal centers in a bifunctional catalyst. Thus,
independently prepared [Rh(mer-κ3-POP-Xantphos-iPr)(H)2(NMeH2)][BArF4], 8 (see Supporting
Information), does not dehydropolymerize H3B·NMeH2, returning unchanged substrate after 1 h (0.2 mol %, 0.111
M H3B·NMeH2). This is probably due to the
relatively strongly bound amine blocking access of H3B·NMeH2 to the metal center, at which the Xantphos-iPr
is also not hemilabile (Figure S1), so that
σ-complex formation by coordination of amine–borane,
and subsequent dehydrogenation by BH/NH activation, does not take
place. The broader promoting effects of NMeH2 are, however,
evident in other cationic {Rh(chelating phosphine)}+ systems
that are suggested to undergo a coordination/dehydrogenation/chain-growth
mechanism. Under the specific conditions reported here, both [Rh(Xantphos-Ph)]+, A,9 and [Rh(Ph2P(CH2)3PPh2)]+, C,16,42 systems show increased Mn, slightly lower Đ,
and no induction periods when ∼2 equiv of NMeH2 is
added to the precatalyst, compared to the nondoped controls (Table 2).

2.7 Discussion
of Proposed Mechanistic Landscape
Bringing these observations
together, we propose an overall mechanism
shown in Scheme 5,
in which the induction period that gets longer with increased [2a] can also now be explained. NMeH2, generated
by slow B–N bond cleavage of H3B·NMeH2, at a rate that is independent of [2a], first promotes
the formation of 3a and then more slowly the active precatalyst 5. In this model, higher concentrations of 2a result in more 3a needing to be first formed, via hydride
abstraction and boronium formation, and then converted to the active
catalyst with an unchanged amount of NMeH2, thus leading
to a longer induction period. The active catalyst is closely related
to both 5/6 and 4a, but we suggest both
of these sit outside of the productive cycle, as their structures
and reactivity are incompatible with the observed kinetics. The insensitivity
in rate to added NMeH2suggests this does
not reversibly dissociate, while a sensible model in which dimeric 4a, with its Rh–Rh bond and bridging amido–bisboryl
ligand, undergoes rapid and reversible dissociation (vide supra) or
loss of ligand is not obvious. Moreover, 4b reacts rapidly
with NMeH2 to form 5, suggesting that if formed
in catalysis it is not persistent. In addition, the fact that both 5 and 4b evolved to the same, currently unresolved,
organometallic species under catalytic conditions suggests that both
sit just outside of the productive catalytic cycle. While we cannot
currently confidently comment on the nature of the actual catalyst
for dehydrogenation, chain growth, or the termination process, the
half-order relationship in [Rh]TOTAL and the observation
of dimeric species (3 and 4) suggest that
such Rh2 motifs may be intimately involved. The strong,
and persistent, inverse relationship between Mn and [Rh]TOTAL, coupled with the sensitivity to
H2, suggests a coordination/insertion/chain-growth mechanism
for which NMeH2 also modifies chain length—possibly
by attenuating chain termination. On the basis of the half-order kinetics
observed from the dehydrogenation studies, we suggest three possible
general motifs for the active catalyst (Scheme 6): one which invokes a monomer–dimer
equilibrium in which one of the monomers is the active catalyst (A),
and one in which a persistent dimer reversibly loses a bound ligand
(B). Scenario A is reminiscent of the unsymmetrical Rh2 hydride dimers that can form in Rh-catalyzed alkene hydrogenations,57 while scenario B is supported by the recent
report that dimeric early transition-metal complexes have been shown
to act as competent catalysts for H3B·NMeH2 dehydropolymerization.7 A third possibility
is that deprotonation of bound NMeH2 provides an active
Rh–NMeH amido motif, similar to the bifunctional catalysts
developed by Schneider and co-workers (C).11

3 Conclusions
We have shown that a combination of catalyst
loading, H2, and NMeH2 can be used to control
the dehydropolymerization
of H3B·NMeH2 in a {Rh(DPEphos}+-based catalyst. We proposed this to be an important observation
and one that may show some generality, building upon the already demonstrated
improvement in catalyst lifetimes on addition of amine.8 The ability to control polymerization by catalyst
loading, NMeH2 addition, and H2 in {Rh(DPEphos)}+ and {Rh(Xantphos-Ph)}+ systems is markedly different
from that found for the {Rh(Xantphos-iPr)}+ catalyst
and further supports that a different mechanism operates between the
two sets, which may be related to the preferred coordination geometry
of the ligands: DPEphos and Xantphos-Ph prefer cis-κ2-P,P while Xantphos-iPr generally
adopts mer-κ2-P,O,P motifs. The
amine systems we describe thus provide a tractable platform for further
detailed mechanistic studies, and efforts are directed to determining
the details of the propagating species and termination events so that
fine control of the overall process, and thus the polymer produced,
can be realized. It will be interesting to see if this effect of added
amine is a more general observation across the now numerous2,3 dehydropolymerization catalysts from across the transition metals.

would also generate “BH3”. At 10 mol % 2a/H3B·NMeH2, ESI–MS shows
the formation of 3a, 4a, and an additional
species with the empirical formula [Rh2(DPEphos)2(B2H5)]+, m/z = 1309.16. Addition of H3B·THF to 2a gives this as the dominant species. Bridging B2H5 units have been previously reported, e.g.: Jacobsen G. B. ; Andersen E. ; Housecroft C. E. ; Hong F. E. ; Buhl M. L. ; Long G. J. ; Fehlner T. P.

For
{Rh(Xantphos-Ph)}+ a similar signal was observed at 5 mol
%/H3B·NMe2H. We speculated upon a β-BH–agostic–amidoborane
motif, but an alternative formulation could be a structure similar
to 4.
