Lignocellulosic biomass
is the only renewable source of carbon
for the chemical industry. Alkylmethoxyphenols can be obtained in
good yield from woody biomass by reductive fractionation, but these
compounds are of limited value for large-scale applications. We present
a method to convert lignocellulose-derived alkylmethoxyphenols to
phenol that can be easily integrated in the petrochemical industry.
The underlying chemistry combines demethoxylation catalyzed by a titania-supported
gold nanoparticle catalyst and transalkylation of alkyl groups to
a low-value benzene-rich stream promoted by HZSM-5 zeolite. In this
way, phenol can be obtained in good yield, and benzene can be upgraded
to more valuable propylbenzene, cumene, and toluene. We demonstrate
that intimate contact between the two catalyst functions is crucial
to transferring the methyl groups from the methoxy functionality to
benzene instead of phenol. In a mixed-bed configuration, we achieved
a yield of 60% phenol and 15% cresol from 4-propylguaiacol in a continuous
one-step reaction at 350 °C at a weight hourly space velocity
of ∼40 h–1.

Introduction
Phenol is one of the
most important intermediates in the chemical
industry. Nearly all phenol is obtained from petroleum-derived benzene
in the cumene process, which covers about 20% of global benzene demand.
Besides drawbacks of a high energy intensity and the coproduction
of acetone, there is a growing interest in replacing petroleum as
a feedstock by renewable biomass.1 Lignin
is recognized as a promising source of bioaromatics, because it is
already available as a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry and
also increasingly of the processing of second-generation lignocellulosic
biomass.2 Converting the polyphenolic network
of lignin into useful aromatics such as BTX (benzene, toluene, and
xylenes) and phenol remains a formidable challenge.3 A recent promising approach is reductive fractionation
of woody biomass in which lignin fragments are released from lignocellulosic
biomass (in planta) and depolymerized into alkylmethoxyphenols
and a carbohydrate residue in a one-pot reaction (Scheme 1).4−11 Depending on the type of wood, aromatics yields higher than 50 wt
% (based on lignin content) have been obtained. These alkylmethoxyphenols,
whose structure derives from the phenylpropane units that are randomly
linked through C–C and C–O–C bonds in lignin,
are primarily phenols functionalized at the para position with an
alkyl group (typically propyl) and methoxy groups at one or both of
the ortho positions. Their overfunctionalized nature limits the number
of applications. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to develop a
chemical route to selectively convert these alkylmethoxyphenols into
phenol, which requires selective demethoxylation and dealkylation
(Scheme 1).

Biomass
The black arrows indicate
the main focus of the present study, the green arrows known technologies
outside the scope of the present study.

The
challenge of demethoxylating these compounds is to avoid hydrogenation
of the aromatic ring and removal of the phenolic hydroxyl group.12,13 Early studies have shown that supported Au and Mo catalysts exhibit
high selectivity to phenolics in the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol.14,15 Steam dealkylation of 4-propylphenol to phenol and propylene has
also been achieved on HZSM-5.16,17 Dealkylation typically
yields olefins that are prone to oligomerization on the used acid
catalysts. A combination of demethoxylation and dealkyation for lignin-derived
monomers has also been discussed.18 Here,
we report an approach that readily converts methoxyalkylphenols into
phenol based on a combination of selective demethoxylation with transalkylation
of the alkyl groups to a conventional benzene feedstock producing
toluene, cumene, and propylbenzene as coproducts (Scheme 1). Notably, toluene and cumene
can respectively be further upgraded to more valuable xylenes using
mature industrialized technologies. We will demonstrate that intimate
contact between a TiO2-supported Au nanoparticle catalyst
for demethoxylation and a HZSM-5 transalkylation catalyst can result
in a phenol yield of nearly 60% from 4-propylguaiacol in a single
step. Our approach builds on earlier examples in which upgrading of
biomass is coupled to a low-value petroleum refinery stream in order
to increase the economic competitivess.19−21

Experimental Section
Materials
4-Propylphenol, 4-propylguaiacol, guaiacol,
catechol, phenol, and benzene were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further treatment. HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al 20) was obtained
from Albemarle. HZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al 15 and 30) were purchased from
Conteka. All the mordenite catalysts were received from Zeolyst. HY
zeolites (Si/Al 60, 120, and 160) were obtained by calcining parent
ammonium forms of the Y zeolite (purchased from Alfa Aesar) at 550
°C for 6 h at a ramping rate of 1 °C/min.

The Au/TiO2 (P25) catalyst was prepared by deposition-precipitation with
NaOH, an appropriate amount of HAuCl4 aqueous solution
(10 mmol/L) was added to 200 mL of deionized water at room temperature.
The pH was adjusted to 7 by dropwise addition of NaOH (1 M), then
2 g of TiO2 support (P25, Evonik-Degussa) was dispersed
in the solution and the pH was readjusted to 7 with NaOH. The suspension
was vigorously stirred for 2 h at room temperature before filtration.
The catalyst was washed by using extensive deionized water until the
filtrate was free of chloride monitored by AgNO3. The obtained
residue was dried overnight at 110 °C. The dried material was
calcined at 350 °C for 2 h after heating at a ramping rate of
2 °C/min. The obtained material was used without pretreatment.
The same procedure was applied to prepare supported Au on anatase
and rutile TiO2 catalysts.

Catalyst Characterization
The gold content of the supported
gold catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) using a Spectro Ciros CCD ICP optical
emission spectrometer with axial plasma viewing. All the samples were
dissolved in aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 = 3:1).

XPS measurements
were performed using a Kratos AXIS Ultra spectrometer, equipped with
a monochromatic X-ray source and a delay-line detector (DLD). Spectra
were obtained using an aluminum anode (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV) operating
at 150 W. Data analysis was performed using CasaXPS software.

Catalytic
Activity Measurements
Demethoxylation of 4-Propylguaiacol
A Parr batch autoclave
with a volume of 100 mL was used for 4-propylguaiacol demethoxylation.
Typically, 100 mg of catalyst and 3000 mg of feedstock were added
to the reactor together with 30 mL of benzene solvent. After sealing,
purging with H2, and checking for leaks, the autoclave
was brought to 50 bar by introducing H2. Then the reactor
was heated to 350 °C in ca. 1 h and maintained at this temperature
for 2 h. A small amount of sample was taken via a sampling valve after
1 and 2 h of reaction time. An aliquot amount of 1 mL of sample was
accurately taken from the reaction mixture. After adding an amount
of 10 μL of dodecane internal standard, the sample was measured
by GC-MS for product identification and quantification. After the
reaction, the reactor was allowed to naturally cool down by removing
the heating oven.

Dealkylation of 4-Propylphenol
A
mini-autoclave with
a volume of 10 mL was used for carrying out 4-propylphenol dealkylation
reactions. Typically, 40 mg of catalyst and 400 mg of feedstock were
added to the reactor together with 4 mL of solvent. After sealing,
the autoclave was transferred to a GC oven, which was preheated to
the desired reaction temperature and maintained at that temperature
for 2 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was removed from the oven
and quenched in an ice bath. After opening the reactor, an amount
of 10 μL of dodecane was added to the reaction mixture as an
internal standard. After separating the catalyst using membrane filtration
or centrifugation, an aliquot of ca. 1 mL of liquid sample was taken
from the reaction mixture and directly subjected to GC-MS analysis
for product identification and quantification. The liquid phase product
mixture was analyzed by a Shimadzu 2010 GC-MS system equipped with
an RTX-1701 column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and
a flame ionization detector (FID) together with a mass spectrometer
detector. Identification of products was achieved based on a search
of the MS spectra with the NIST11 and NIST11s MS libraries.

Demethoxylation
and Transalkylation of 4-Propylguaiacol
A home-built down-flow
fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel, 6 mm inner
diameter, 150 mm length) was used for the dealkylation and demethoxylation
reaction. In a typical experiment, 25–100 mg of Au/TiO2 (125–250 μm) and 100–200 mg of HZSM-5
catalyst powder (125–250 μm) were loaded in a tubular
reactor either stacked (Au/TiO2 on top of HZSM-5) or homogeneously
mixed. For the stacked catalyst bed, a small amount of quartz wool
was placed between the two catalyst beds. The pressure was maintained
at 100 bar by a back-pressure controller. H2 was introduced
at a flow rate of 30 N mL/min. Typically, the temperature was maintained
at 350 °C. After reaching the reaction temperature, a 4-propylguaiacol-benzene
solution (5 mol % 4-propylguaiacol) was fed through a preheated (200
°C) feeding line using an HPLC pump at a flow rate in the 2.3–9.0
mL/h range. The liquid products were collected in a cold trap installed
directly after the reactor. Samples were collected every 1 h. An aliquot
of 1 mL was accurately taken from the reaction mixture. After adding
10 μL of dodecane internal standard, the sample was analyzed
by GC-MS for product identification and quantification.

Kinetic Investigations
A Parr autoclave with a volume
of 100 mL was used for investigating the reaction pathways using guaiacol,
catechol, and phenol as reactants. When phenol was used as a reactant,
a stoichiometric amount of methanol was used. Either 50 mg of Au/TiO2 or 100 mg of HZSM-5 catalyst and 10 mmol of substrate were
added to the reactor together with 30 mL of benzene solvent. All the
other procedures are the same as in the previous section.

Results and Discussion
We first explored the transalkylation
of the propyl groups to benzene
using 4-propylphenol as a model reactant. We screened a number of
microporous zeolites using 10 mL batch autoclaves at 350 °C for
2 h. Among the explored 10-membered (HZSM-5) and 12-membered ring
(HMOR and HY) zeolites, HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 15 stood out
as a highly active and selective catalyst for the transalkylation
of 4-propylphenol with benzene. The major products from benzene were
n-propylbenzene (58 mol %) and cumene (28 mol %; Figure 1b). HZSM-5 zeolite with a higher
Si/Al ratio did not significantly alter the product distribution,
although a slight decrease of the activity was observed. Such a trend
was also observed in an earlier dealkylation study, where HZSM-5 zeolites
with different Si/Al ratios were compared for the dealkylation of
4-propylphenol into phenol and propylene.16 Although in the present study HZSM-5 zeolites with Si/Al ratios
of 15 and 40 gave comparable results at 350 °C, the performance
of the zeolite with a higher Si/Al ratio was substantially lower when
the reaction temperature was below 325 °C. The pore size of the
zeolites also affects the product distribution. The most striking
observation is that a large-pore zeolite like HY results in more n-propylbenzene
and less cumene than the medium-pore HZSM-5 zeolite. Characterization
of the spent catalysts by thermogravimetric analysis shows that spent
HY and HMOR zeolites contain more carbonaceous products (11–16%
by weight) than HZSM-5 (6–7%; Figure S1). This difference is due to the shape selectivity of the 10-membered
ring pores in HZSM-5, which limits the formation of larger products.
These coking reactions likely also involve propylene molecules, which
were not efficiently transferred to the benzene solvent. This is consistent
with the lower rate of alkylbenzene formation for the large-pore zeolites.
Thus, HZSM-5 is the preferred zeolite for transalkylation of propylphenol
with benzene.

Figure 1 Product distribution of (a) 4-propylphenol- and (b) benzene-derived
products of the transalkylation of 4-propylphenol with benzene over
different zeolites (conditions: 400 mg 4-propylphenol, 4 mL benzene,
40 mg catalyst, 350 °C, 2 h, the zeolite Si/Al ratio given in
brackets, the selectivity and yield of alkylbenzenes are based on
the 4-propylphenol feedstock).

Increasing the 4-propylphenol/benzene ratio resulted in a
significant
decrease of the activity and product selectivity (Figure S2). Without benzene, only 5 mol % phenol was obtained,
and the main reaction products were polyalkyphenols. The nonclosure
of the mass balance indicates that extensive polymerization occurred.
We verified that similar transalkylation chemistry is also possible
with toluene instead of benzene, albeit the phenol yield decreased
slightly (Figure S3). The only side-products
are propylphenol isomers. No methylphenol was formed, confirming that
the reverse transalkylation reaction between phenols and solvent did
not occur. On the other hand, the use of ethylbenzene and propylbenzene
significantly decreased the transalkylation efficiency. With these
solvents, a small amount of solvent-derived alkylphenols (e.g., ethylphenols
and dipropylphenols) was formed, meaning that reverse transalkylation
took place. We also found that the presence of water has a pronounced
negative effect on the transalkylation activity. For all the water-containing
experiments, hardly any phenol was obtained, and extensive polymerization
occurred. From these experiments, we infer that the use of benzene
and toluene as a solvent can prevent unwanted side-reactions involving
reactive olefins and radical species obtained during the dealkylation
of 4-propylphenol.

Experiments involving transalkylation of
methoxy-containing phenols
such as guaiacol and 4-propylguaiacol with benzene using a zeolite
catalyst resulted in severe coke formation (Figure S4). A survey of the literature shows that polymerization starts
with the homolysis of the O–CH3 group, which results
in reactive methyl radicals and catechol.22 Accordingly, we speculated that removing the methoxy group prior
to dealkylation is a necessary step for obtaining phenol. For the
demethoxylation step, a set of supported Au catalysts were prepared
through a deposition–precipitation method. The 1 wt % Au catalysts
were prepared on different forms of TiO2 and other oxide
supports (Figure S5). Au was selected as
the hydrogenation component because of its low activity for aromatic
ring hydrogenation. On the basis of this and the higher Ar–OH
bond energy (414 kJ/mol) compared to the Ar–OCH3 bond energy (356 kJ/mol),23 we expected
that the methoxy group could be removed without losing aromaticity
and the phenolic hydroxyl moiety. The performance of these materials
was evaluated in a 100 mL Parr autoclave at 350 °C for 2 h using
propylguaiacol as the model reactant in benzene. The results demonstrated
that 1 wt % Au/TiO2 (P25) exhibits the highest activity
and selectivity. Full conversion of propylguaiacol was achieved. The
main products were propylphenol (∼50 mol %), methylpropylphenols
(∼25 mol %), and polyalkylphenols (∼10 mol %). Au supported
on anatase is less effective compared to the P25 TiO2 support.
All the other catalysts are nearly inactive for this reaction. We
also confirmed that the P25 TiO2 support only displays
negligible activity for demethoxylation (∼ 5 mol % phenol).
These results suggest that the interface between Au and TiO2 support is involved in the selective demethoxylation reaction. XPS
analysis of the calcined Au/TiO2(P25) catalyst shows that
80% of the Au (0.76 wt %) is in the metallic state with the remaining
Au being in the +1 oxidation state (Figure S6).

Initial experiments involving a two-step approach in which
4-propylguaiacol
in benzene was first demethoxylated over Au/TiO2 followed
by dealkylation using HZSM-5 in a flow reactor showed promising phenol
yields (Figure S7). In further experiments,
we combined both catalysts in a flow reactor at 350 °C and a
H2 pressure of 100 bar in order to achieve a one-step process.
First, we investigated a stacked-bed configuration with Au/TiO2 on top of HZSM-5. The product selectivity was optimized by
changing the amount of Au/TiO2 (25–200 mg) using
a fixed amount of 100 mg of HZSM-5. When the amount of Au/TiO2 was small (25 mg), not all the methoxy groups were removed,
and the conversion rapidly decreased from 92% to 50%, resulting in
a very low phenol yield after 6 h of reaction (Figure 2a). Increasing the amount of Au/TiO2 to 50 mg significantly increased the phenol yield and lowered the
rate of deactivation of HZSM-5 (Figure 2b). When 100 mg of Au/TiO2 was used, a phenol
yield of ∼50 mol % could be maintained at a feeding rate in
the 4.5–6.8 mL/h range. A higher feeding rate (9.0 mL/h) resulted
in a lower phenol yield, because the transalkylation activity was
insufficient as followed from a higher yield of methylpropylphenols
and cresol (Figure 2c). This lower phenol yield could be offset by increasing the amount
of HZSM-5 to 200 mg, resulting in good phenol yield at a feed rate
of 9.0 mL/h (Figure 2d). We also varied the reaction temperature (300–400 °C)
using 100 mg of Au/TiO2 and 100 mg of HZSM-5 at a feed
rate of 4.5 mL/h (Figure S8). Efficient
one-step demethoxylation and transalkylation can already be achieved
at a reaction temperature of 325 °C. At 300 °C, the dealkylation
rate is too slow as evidenced by the large amount of propylphenol
formation. A too high reaction temperature (375–400 °C)
results in lower phenol yield, likely due to more pronounced side-reactions.

process for demethoxylation and dealkylation over (a–d)
stacked-bed and (e,f) mixed-bed Au/TiO2 and HZSM-5 (Si/Al
= 15) catalysts in benzene using a fixed-bed down-flow reactor (conditions:
5 mol % 4-propylguaiacol in benzene, 350 °C, 100 bar, gas flow
rate 30 N mL/min H2, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV):
(a) 48 h–1, (b and e) 40 h–1,
(c and f) 30 h–1, and (d) 20 h–1.

In order to gain better insight
into the underlying chemistry,
we employed model compounds such as guaiacol, catechol, and phenol
dissolved in benzene over either Au/TiO2 or HZSM-5 in a
batch reactor at 350 °C (Scheme 2). When phenol was used, an equimolar amount of methanol
was added to the mixture. For guaiacol, the results between the Au/TiO2 and HZSM-5 catalysts are very different. Au/TiO2 can rapidly convert guaiacol into phenol (∼50.6%), coproducing
cresol (19.6%) and polymethylphenols (13.4%). The methyl groups will
transfer preferentially to the aromatic ring of phenolic products
rather than being transferred to benzene. From the observations that
catechol was absent as a product and Au/TiO2 is also active
in the alkylation of phenol with methanol (Scheme 2c), we can infer that the methoxy group is
removed from guaiacol as methanol followed by alkylation of the phenol
product with methanol. However, given the fact that one of the hydroxyl
groups in catechol can be rapidly removed by Au/TiO2 to
form phenol (Scheme 2b), we cannot rule out the possibility that the methyl group is transferred
directly to the aromatic ring involving methyl catechol as an intermediate
compound. HZSM-5 is only slightly active in demethoxylating guaiacol,
and instead of phenol, catechol is the main product. The formation
of catechol might cause char formation, which leads to catalyst deactivation.
This is confirmed by the significant nonclosure of the mass balance
and the nearly identical results obtained after 1 and 2 h of reaction
(Scheme 2b). Notably,
the methyl group could be effectively transferred to benzene, evidenced
by the formation of toluene (Scheme 2a). An alkylation experiment between phenol and methanol
catalyzed by HZSM-5 confirms this as well (Scheme 2c).

Scheme 2 Conversion of (a) Guaiacol, (b) Catechol,
and (c) Phenol over the
Au/TiO2 and HZSM-5 Catalysts in Benzene Solvent Using a
Batch Reactor (Conditions: 10 mmol Feedstock, 100 mg HZSM-5 or 50
mg Au/TiO2, 30 mL Benzene, 350 °C, 50 bar H2)
With these mechanistic insights
in hand, we were able to further
improve the process by using a bed configuration in which the two
catalysts were mixed. When 50 mg or 100 mg of Au/TiO2 was
physically mixed with 100 mg of HZSM-5, the yield of phenol could
be significantly improved to nearly 60 mol %. Notably, much less methylpropylphenols
and cresols were obtained compared to the experiments using a stacked-bed
configuration. Scheme 3 summarizes the possible differences between these two cases. In
the stacked-bed configuration, the phenol yield is limited by the
formation of methylated phenols in the top Au/TiO2 bed.
These methylated phenols cannot be removed by HZSM-5 and will lead
to cresol and methylpropylphenols (Scheme 3a). The benefit of using a mixed-bed configuration
is that the methyl group, which is removed from 4-propylguaiacol via
HZSM-5 catalyzed demethylation or via Au/TiO2 catalyzed
demethoxylation, can be efficiently transferred to the benzene solvent
via HZSM-5 catalyzed transalkylation, minimizing the formation of
methylated phenols (Scheme 3b). Overall, this leads to a 2.5-fold higher yield of toluene
for the mixed-bed compared to the stacked-bed configuration, and a
phenol yield close to 60 mol % yield was achieved with 15 mol % cresol
and 20 mol % of methylpropylphenols as side-products.

Conclusions
This
work presents a novel process to selectively produce phenol
from lignocellulose-derived alkylmethoxyphenols via demethoxylation
and transalkylation using a mixture of Au/TiO2 and HZSM-5
catalysts in benzene. The use of benzene is crucial for obtaining
a high yield of phenol, minimizing coke formation related to reactive
intermediates obtained from methoxy and propyl side chains. This is
because benzene is able to effectively react with these alkyl groups
by forming alkylbenzenes. In this way, benzene can be upgraded to
more valuable propylbenzene, cumene, and toluene. We also demonstrated
that intimate contact between the Au/TiO2 demethoxylation
catalyst and the HZSM-5 transalkylation catalyst is crucial for obtaining
a high yield of phenol. This ensures that the methyl group of 4-propylguaiacol
effectively ends up in toluene rather than in methylated phenols.
This work offers a promising next step toward obtaining bio-based
phenol from lignocellulosic biomass.
