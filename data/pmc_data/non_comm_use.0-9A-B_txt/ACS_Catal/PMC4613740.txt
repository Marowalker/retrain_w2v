Potato
epoxide hydrolase 1 exhibits rich enantio- and regioselectivity
in the hydrolysis of a broad range of substrates. The enzyme can be
engineered to increase the yield of optically pure products as a result
of changes in both enantio- and regioselectivity. It is thus highly
attractive in biocatalysis, particularly for the generation of enantiopure
fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The present work aims to establish
the principles underlying the activity and selectivity of the enzyme
through a combined computational, structural, and kinetic study using
the substrate trans-stilbene oxide as a model system.
Extensive empirical valence bond simulations have been performed on
the wild-type enzyme together with several experimentally characterized
mutants. We are able to computationally reproduce the differences
between the activities of different stereoisomers of the substrate
and the effects of mutations of several active-site residues. In addition,
our results indicate the involvement of a previously neglected residue,
H104, which is electrostatically linked to the general base H300.
We find that this residue, which is highly conserved in epoxide hydrolases
and related hydrolytic enzymes, needs to be in its protonated form
in order to provide charge balance in an otherwise negatively charged
active site. Our data show that unless the active-site charge balance
is correctly treated in simulations, it is not possible to generate
a physically meaningful model for the enzyme that can accurately reproduce
activity and selectivity trends. We also expand our understanding
of other catalytic residues, demonstrating in particular the role
of a noncanonical residue, E35, as a “backup base” in
the absence of H300. Our results provide a detailed view of the main
factors driving catalysis and regioselectivity in this enzyme and
identify targets for subsequent enzyme design efforts.

1 Introduction
Epoxide
hydrolases (EHs) catalyze the hydrolysis of epoxides to
the corresponding vicinal diols. They are widely distributed, with
biological functions depending on the organism of origin. Known functions
can largely be grouped into detoxification through the breakdown of
toxic epoxides, catabolism, and cellular signaling.1 Furthermore, the enzymes’ ability to catalyze the
resolution of racemic epoxides makes them attractive tools in biocatalysis,
as they can help fulfill the ever-increasing need for enantiopure
pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals.2 In
this context, potato (Solanum tuberosum) epoxide hydrolase 1 (StEH1) has been a system of particular interest
(see, e.g., refs (2−10)). We have recently demonstrated that it is possible to obtain engineered
variants of this enzyme that produce optically pure products as a
result of changes in both enantio- and regioselectivity.9 Clearly, a detailed understanding of the catalytic
mechanism of StEH1 would facilitate progress in this direction, as
would the availability of a computational approach that can reliably
and efficiently predict the effects of mutations on function.

Figure 1 shows a
generalized mechanism for the reaction catalyzed by StEH1 based on
proposals put forward in the literature.4,6 Following substrate
binding, the reaction occurs in three sequential steps: (I) nucleophilic
attack by D105 on one of the two epoxide carbons of the bound substrate
(C1 or C2), leading to a covalent alkyl−enzyme adduct; (II)
nucleophilic attack by a conserved active-site water molecule (usually
believed to be activated by H300 as a general base) to form a tetrahedral
intermediate; and (III) decay to the product which is subsequently
released from the enzyme. It should be noted that there has been some
controversy about the details of the reaction,5,6,11,12 in particular
with respect to the putative general base. The authors of a recent
computational study of murine-soluble EH (sEH)12 suggested that the histidine of the active-site triad (H523
in this enzyme) must be protonated. The conclusion was based on the
calculated activation barrier (which was lower for the protonated
form of the histidine), correct prediction of the regioselectivity,
and the presence of improved hydrogen-bonding interactions to stabilize
the relevant transition states as well as empirical pKa calculations that suggested a strongly shifted pKa value (up to 10–11) for this residue.12 However, protonating this histidine would require
unorthodox approaches to activate the hydrolytic water molecule. Additionally,
mutation of the equivalent residue in StEH1, H300, to asparagine almost
completely abolished the activity during the hydrolysis step,4 suggesting that this histidine is indeed the
most likely general base.

Figure 1 Generalized mechanism for the reaction catalyzed
by StEH1. Also
included is the structure of the substrate studied, trans-stilbene oxide (TSO).

In the present work, we have performed long-time-scale empirical
valence bond (EVB)13,14 simulations of the enantio- and
regioselective hydrolysis of trans-stilbene oxide
(TSO) (Figure 1). TSO
was chosen as our model substrate because of its size; it almost completely
fills the StEH1 active site, thus avoiding the complications that
would arise from the multiple potential binding modes expected with
smaller substrates. In addition, extensive experimental data (see,
e.g., refs (4−6), (8), and (9)) are available for this
particular substrate that can be used for benchmarking and validation
of our theoretical models. It should be noted that computational studies
of enzyme selectivity are made particularly challenging by the very
small energy differences between various substrates and between mutant
forms of the enzyme as well as the long simulation times required
to obtain convergent free energies (see, e.g., refs (15) and (16)). As discussed in ref (12), while it can be very
hard to obtain quantitatively reliable results, an increasing number
of elegant studies (see, e.g., refs (12), (16), and (17)) show that
there is potential for real progress using current techniques.

The computational work herein has been coupled with a crystallographic
study of the H300N mutant form of the enzyme, in which the conventional
general-base functionality of StEH1 has been removed. We have also
performed biochemical characterization of an E35Q/H300N double mutant
form of the enzyme, which has no viable active-site base for the hydrolytic
step shown in Figure 1. We are able to reproduce both the catalytic activity of the wild-type
enzyme and the experimentally observed effects upon mutation of the
known active-site residues with quantitative accuracy. Additionally,
we have identified a key active-site residue, H104, that has been
overlooked in both previous experimental4,6,7,18,19 and computational works.6,11,12,19,20 This histidine, which plays an indirect electrostatic role in modulating
the activity of StEH1, is highly conserved among epoxide hydrolases
and related hydrolytic enzymes. Taken together, our observations strongly
suggest that the canonical “catalytic triad” in epoxide
hydrolases (and related enzymes) needs to be expanded to include E35
and H104.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 System
Setup
The crystal structure
of StEH1 without substrate was obtained from the Protein Data Bank21 (PDB entry 2CJP, 1.95 Å resolution18). Potential flips of histidine, asparagine, and glutamine
side chains were evaluated using the MolProbity server,22 and those suggested for H269, H308, and H313
were applied to the structure. Protonation states of active-site side
chains were investigated using PROPKA 3.123 and by visual inspection of their hydrogen-bonding patterns. The
Cγ of the active-site nucleophile D105 was defined as the simulation
center, and all of the crystallographic waters within 16 Å of
this center were retained. The substrate TSO was manually placed in
the active site and covalently connected to D105 to form the alkyl–enzyme
intermediate. This structure was used as the starting point for simulations
in both the backward and forward directions, leading to the Michaelis
complex and the tetrahedral intermediate, respectively.

The
E35Q, Y154F, and Y235F mutant forms of the enzyme were manually generated
by deletion and/or replacement of atoms in the wild-type structure.
For Y149F, the published crystal structure (PDB entry 3CXU(7)) was used; the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with respect
to the Cα atoms of the wild-type structure was 0.2 Å, with
only minor local changes observed. The structure of the H300N mutant
reported here (see below) was used in all of the calculations for
this variant. While this structure is overall very similar to the
wild-type structure (RMSD = 0.3 Å for 320 matched Cα atoms),
there are significant differences in the active sites, particularly
at residues 35 and 300, and in the positioning of the nearby waters
(Figures 2 and S1).

the alkyl–enzyme
intermediate in which the ring-opened substrate, (S,S)-TSO (purple sticks), and the nucleophile D105
are covalently bonded. Also shown are other key catalytic residues,
as discussed in the main text. The model is based on the StEH1 crystal
structure (PDB entry 2CJP(18)) after initial equilibration of the
covalently bound intermediate. (B) Overlay of the active sites of

2.2 Molecular
Dynamics Simulations
Molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted using the OPLS-AA force field24 as implemented in the Q simulation package (version
5.06).25 For the Michaelis complex with
TSO, the alkyl–enzyme intermediate, and the tetrahedral intermediate
(see Figure 1), OPLS-AA-compatible
force field parameters were generated using the MacroModel 9.1 force
field, version 2001 (Schrödinger, LLC).26 Partial charges were generated using the HF/6-31G* RESP
procedure described in ref (27). All of the simulations were performed by solvating the
system in a spherical water droplet with a radius of 20 Å subject
to surface-constrained all-atom solvent (SCAAS) boundary conditions.28 The water droplet was composed of TIP3P29 water molecules centered on the Cγ atom
of the active-site nucleophile, D105. All of the atoms within 17 Å
of the simulation center were fully mobile, atoms between 17 and 20
Å were restrained with a 10 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 harmonic restraint, and atoms outside
the boundary were restrained to their initial positions with a harmonic
force constant of 200 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 following the standard procedure used in our previous
work (see, e.g., ref (30)). Therefore, the water droplet complements the 16 Å sphere
of crystallographic waters that was retained for the simulations and
ensures that these waters fall within the mobile region of the simulation.
A cutoff of 10 Å was used for the calculation of nonbonded interactions
between all atoms except for those in the EVB region, for which all
of the interactions were explicitly calculated up to 99 Å from
each atom (i.e., no cutoff was applied). Long-range electrostatic
interactions beyond this cutoff were treated with the local reaction
field (LRF)31 method. The SHAKE32 algorithm was applied to all of the solvent
molecules except the hydrolytic water molecule, which is directly
involved in the chemical reaction and needs to be able to break and
form O–H and C–O bonds, respectively.

The systems
were initially heated from 1 to 300 K over a short 25 ps simulation,
applying a 200 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 harmonic force constant on the solute atoms to restrain them to
their crystallographic positions. This allowed for solvent equilibration
around the solute molecule. The system was cooled to 5 K for another
10 ps and then reheated to 300 K for 70 ps of simulation time while
the force constants of the harmonic restraint were gradually decreased
from 200 to 0.5 kcal·mol–1·Å–2. Finally, a 10 ns equilibration was performed at
300 K using a force constant of 0.5 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 on atoms treated as EVB atoms. The
end point of this equilibration run was then used as a starting point
for subsequent EVB simulations. The temperature of the system was
regulated using the Berendsen thermostat33 (with a 100 fs bath relaxation time). The time step used in all
of the simulations was 1 fs.

For the corresponding reaction
in water, the positions of the atoms
in the reactive region (the atoms treated as EVB atoms) were extracted
directly from the equilibrated protein structure. The nucleophilic
aspartate and general-base histidine were truncated to propionate
and ethylimidazole, respectively. The resulting system was solvated
in a 20 Å water sphere centered at the carboxylic carbon of the
propionate ion following the protocol described above. Finally, the
system was equilibrated for 1 ns before the start of the EVB calculations.

2.3 Empirical Valence Bond Calculations
The
computational method of choice in this work was the empirical
valence bond (EVB) approach,13,14 which is a semiempirical
multiscale approach to describe chemical reactivity based on valence
bond theory. The EVB approach is sufficiently fast to allow easy access
to up to microseconds of conformational sampling and provides a physically
meaningful description of bond-breaking and bond-making processes.34 Thus, quantitatively reliable modeling of enzyme
selectivity is possible.15,16 Additionally, the success
of the EVB approach, as applied to numerous biological systems, has
been extensively documented,14,34 and its ability to
predict and rationalize mutational effects has made it a powerful
tool for computer-guided enzyme redesign35−37 (which is the
ultimate goal of this work).

EVB relies on a well-defined reference
state.38 For enzymatic reactions, the most
natural choice is the uncatalyzed reaction in solution. In cases where
the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is fully understood, the wild-type enzyme
can be used as a reference state for a series of mutant forms of the
enzyme. In the present work, extensive experimental data are available
for several mutant forms,4,5,7 and therefore, in principle, the wild-type enzyme should be an adequate
reference state. However, as discussed below, it is not immediately
obvious which protonation states of the coupled active-site residues
H104 and H300 are likely to be relevant during the catalytic step
(see the discussion in refs (12) and (20)). Therefore, we used the reaction in solution as a reference, allowing
us to fit our EVB simulations to a common reference point and compare
different combinations of histidine protonation states. Once the reference
state has been clearly and rigorously defined and parametrized, the
same parameter set can then be used unchanged for the wild-type and
mutant forms of the enzyme (see the discussion in ref (34)), allowing us to directly
examine the catalytic effect of the enzyme and compare the effects
of mutations without the need for any adjustable parameters. During
calibration of the reference state, one important aspect to take into
account is that the preferred mechanism in solution, without the catalyst
present, can be different from the one in the enzyme active site,
as one feature of the enzyme may be to change the mechanism of the
uncatalyzed reaction (making a usually unfavorable mechanism favorable).
Therefore, the effect of having different mechanisms and different
environments should be considered separately.39 In the first case, it is normally straightforward to estimate the
difference between these mechanisms in aqueous solution, and therefore,
the only relevant state to consider is the “chemically filtered”
reference reaction, defined as the reaction that follows exactly the
same mechanism as the one in the enzyme but occurs in the absence
of enzyme. The energetics of this reaction can be obtained from either
actual or extrapolated experimental data or, when such data are not
available, by means of high-level (density functional theory or ab
initio) quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations. In such a way, it is
possible to obtain a reasonable estimate of the energetics of the
reference reaction to within a few kcal/mol, which can seem quite
large in terms of absolute energy but is still an acceptable error
margin compared with the huge rate accelerations afforded by the majority
of enzymes.40 This has been clarified in
much greater detail in ref (38).

As outlined in Figure 1, the StEH1 reaction starts with nucleophilic
attack on the
bound epoxide to form an alkyl–enzyme intermediate, followed
by general-base ester hydrolysis of the alkyl–enzyme intermediate
that proceeds via a short-lived tetrahedral intermediate, which decomposes
to the final product. As the last step is extremely fast and certainly
not rate-limiting,41 for computational
simplicity we focused on the first two steps, which were described
in terms of two valence bond structures, as illustrated in Figure 3. Additionally, mutagenesis
studies4 provide evidence that D105 (Figure 2) acts as the nucleophile
to open the epoxide ring and that Y154 and Y235 are also crucial for
the catalytic activity, forming an oxyanion hole to stabilize the
alkyl–enzyme intermediate. Even more importantly, rapid kinetics
suggests that the opened epoxide ring is only protonated later in
the reaction.5 Taking into account this
information, we calibrated the two first steps of the process as described
in sections S1.1 and S1.2 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Overview of the valence bond states used to describe (1→2)
nucleophilic attack on the epoxide oxygen to form an alkyl−enzyme
intermediate (Step I) and (2→3) hydrolysis of the alkyl−enzyme
intermediate by the hydrolytic water molecule (blue) using H300 as
a general base (Step II).

All of the EVB calculations were performed using the standard
EVB
free energy perturbation/umbrella sampling (EVB-FEP/US) procedure
outlined in refs (14) and (42). For the
enzymatic reaction, the EVB region always included the substrate,
the side chains of D105 and H300 (including CβH2), and the hydrolytic water molecule. During formation of
the alkyl–enzyme intermediate, the H300 side chain and the
hydrolytic water molecule were present as spectator atoms in order
to keep the same EVB region throughout. In the hydrolysis step, the
H300 side chain acted as a potential general base to activate the
hydrolytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the alkyl–enzyme
intermediate. As all of the atoms in all of the valence bond states
were treated using the same force field, the only
differences between the reacting (EVB) and nonreacting atoms were
the use of Morse rather than harmonic potentials to describe bonds
that were changing during the reaction (see the Supporting Information) and the fact that the EVB atoms did
not have a cutoff for calculation of the nonbonded interactions. Hence,
the distinction between nonreacting EVB atoms and the remainder of
the system was primarily for chemical bookkeeping and did not affect
the outcome of the simulation. Finally, for the corresponding background
reaction, D105 and H300 were truncated to propionate and ethylimidazole,
respectively (ensuring the same reacting atoms in both the enzymatic
and background reactions), and ethylimidazole and the hydrolytic water
molecule were included only in our model of the hydrolytic step of
the reaction.

The starting point for our EVB simulations was
the end point of
the initial 10 ns equilibration run. As a first step, we performed
an additional 250 ps of equilibration, taking structures every 25
ps to provide 10 different starting structures for subsequent EVB
simulations. All of the EVB simulations were performed in 51 windows,
each 200 ps in length, applying either a 0.5 (protein) or 1 kcal·mol–1·Å–2 (water) harmonic
restraint to the reactive region. The larger restraint in the water
simulation was necessary to focus the sampling, since greater conformational
space is available in the absence of the protein. For similar reasons,
in the second reaction step (hydrolysis of the alkyl–enzyme
intermediate; Figure 1) it was necessary to apply a weak (3 kcal·mol–1·Å–2) distance restraint between the
oxygen atom of the hydrolytic water molecule and the Cγ atom
of D105 and between the water hydrogen and the proton acceptor (Nε2 or Oδ1 for H300 and E35, respectively).
The calibration of the reference reaction in aqueous solution and
EVB parameters are provided in the Supporting Information. All of the other parameters were identical to
those used for the equilibration runs. A total protein simulation
time of 5.6 μs was used, including all of the equilibration
runs and EVB simulations for all of the setups and variants considered
in this work.

2.4 Empirical pKa Estimates
Estimates of pKa values for key active-site
residues were obtained by rapid empirical screening using PROPKA 3.1.23 This program provides reasonable estimates of
protein pKa values23 and can also identify non-covalently coupled groups and
model their titration behavior.43 The latter
is particularly relevant here, as the protonation states of H104 and
H300 are likely to be coupled because of their close proximity. We
used a local installation of PROPKA 3.123 to obtain estimates of pKa values from
snapshots of the equilibrated system at different stages of the reaction
cycle. For the alkyl–enzyme intermediate, the pKa calculations were performed directly on the equilibrated
structure after 10 ns of molecular dynamics equilibration. For the
Michaelis complex and the tetrahedral intermediate, we used the structure
from the last window of the relevant EVB calculation. The pKa values for the substrate-free enzyme were
calculated directly from the crystal structure of wild-type StEH1
(PDB entry 2CJP)18 and the crystal structure of the H300N
mutant reported here (PDB entry 4Y9S).

2.5 Sequence
Alignment and Conservation of H104
To identify other residues
that could be of importance in catalysis,
sequences from the epoxide hydrolase superfamily were obtained from
the ESTHER sequence database.44 The sequences
were grouped into three different pools: (1) the whole epoxide hydrolase
superfamily, including putative EH-like enzymes, dehalogenases, and
mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST)-like enzymes; (2) only EH-like
enzymes; and (3) only dehalogenase enzymes. All of these are thought
to use an aspartate nucleophile within the catalytic triad, introducing
an additional negative charge in the active site and enabling the
formation of a salt bridge with the general-base histidine. The sequences
were aligned using Clustal Omega45 with
default alignment parameters. Sequence logo plots were created using
a local version of WebLogo 3.46 Plots were
generated according to the probability of finding the residue at a
given position without the need for additional weighting. After a
first alignment, sequences not containing an aspartate at the expected
nucleophile position were removed, and the alignments were repeated.
The StEH1 sequence was also used as a query in BLAST47 searches for related sequences among mammals, plants, and
fungi. Several annotated sequences were then used for an additional
alignment to check for conservation of H104.

2.6 Construction
and Characterization of the E35Q/H300N
Double Mutant
The E35Q/H300N double mutant was constructed
by combining the pGTacStEH1-5H-based mutants E35Q6 and H300N.4 The plasmid carrying
the H300N mutation was digested with the restriction enzymes MunI and SpeI (Thermo Scientific), and
the resulting fragment was ligated into the corresponding plasmid
encoding the E35Q mutant, digested with the same pair of enzymes,
to yield the final variant. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). The
recombinant protein was produced and then purified by Ni(II)-IMAC
and size-exclusion chromatography as previously described.4 For steady-state kinetic measurements, the purified
enzyme (1.5 μM) was mixed with a range of concentrations of
(R,R)-TSO (up to 500 μM) in
0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) with 1% (v/v) acetonitrile. Hydrolysis
was measured at 30 °C by following the absorbance of the substrate
at 225 nm.4 No decrease in epoxide concentration
was observed after 5 min, so the mutant was considered to be inactive.
The formation of the alkyl–enzyme intermediate was detected
as a decrease in tryptophan fluorescence using a sequential stopped-flow
spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics SX.20MV).4 The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the detected
light was filtered through a 320 nm cutoff filter. Multiple-turnover
experiments were performed at 30 °C in 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 6.8) with 1% (v/v) acetonitrile. The enzyme concentration
was 0.5 μM, and the substrate concentration varied between 1.6
and 50 μM. Apparent rate constants were determined by fits of
the data points to a single-exponential function (eq 1), 1  where A is the amplitude
of the fluorescence change, kobs is the
observed rate constant, and C is the floating end
point.

Curve fitting was performed using QNFIT in SIMFIT (www.simfit.org.uk), from which the microscopic rate constants
were determined using eq 2: 2  In this
model, k2 is the rate of alkyl–enzyme
formation and k–2 and k3 are the rates
of decay of the alkyl–enzyme intermediate back to the Michaelis
complex and forward to the product, respectively. The quenched tryptophan
fluorescence signal was not recovered after 5 min of incubation, confirming
the lack of product formation; thus, k3 in eq 2 was set to
zero, and the intercept on the y axis (i.e., at [S]
= 0) corresponded to k–2.

2.7 Crystal Structure of the H300N Mutant
Mutagenesis and
protein production of the H300N mutant have been
described previously.4 The StEH1 crystals
were obtained under the same conditions as for the wild-type enzyme18 and then soaked for 5 min at pH 3.5 in cryoprotectant
solution prior to flash-cooling. X-ray data were collected at the
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The structure
was solved and refined using the programs of the CCP4 interface.48 After the data were processed with MOSFLM49 and SCALA,50 the
two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the wild-type enzyme (PDB
entry 2CJP)
were placed using rigid-body refinement with REFMAC5.51 H300 was mutated to asparagine, and the structure was rebuilt
as needed using O.52 Waters were added
with COOT53 in conjunction with restrained
refinement in REFMAC5. Statistics for the data and final refined model
are summarized in Table S1. The H300N structure
and X-ray data have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank21 as entry 4Y9S.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Probing Likely Protonation
States of the Active-Site
Histidines
A generalized mechanism for the reaction catalyzed
by StEH1 is shown in Figure 1. In our study, we considered both the (R,R) and (S,S)
enantiomers of TSO as well as nucleophilic attack at either the C1
or C2 of the epoxide ring. We first reassessed the protonation state
of H300 following discussion arising from previous computational studies.6,12,20 While we obtained a similarly
high estimate for the pKa of H300 in the
substrate-free enzyme as that cited in ref (12), this value drops substantially once the substrate
is bound and stays comparably low at each step of the catalytic cycle
(Table 1). On the basis
of this result, combined with experiments strongly supporting the
role of this histidine as a general base,4,6,54 it seems unlikely that it is protonated
during the catalytic cycle. Additionally, the pKa of the nucleophilic D105 is elevated to ∼6 upon substrate
binding, suggesting that both the catalytic base and the nucleophile
could contribute to the acidic limb of the pH rate profile4 (Figure 4).

and C2 at each stage of the reaction pathway. For SF, values were
obtained from chain A of the respective crystal structure. All of
the pKa values were estimated with PROPKA
3.1 as described in Materials and Methods.

b In INT and TD this residue
is covalently
bound to the substrate, and therefore, its pKa value was not calculated (n.d.).

c For the H300N mutant, the pKa values for RS and INT were obtained after
MD simulations with H104 protonated. Because of the missing catalytic
water in this crystal structure, the second step was not modeled,
and pKa estimates for TD are not presented.

We also propose the involvement
of a second, previously neglected
but strongly conserved histidine in the active site, H104 (Figures 2 and 5). On the basis of sequence alignments, the canonical conserved
residues could be identified in the wider epoxide hydrolase-like superfamily
(Figure S2A), the epoxide hydrolase family
specifically (Figure S2B), dehalogenases
(Figure S2C), and the annotated sequences
from mammals, plants, fungi, and bacteria obtained after aligning
BLAST results to the StEH1 sequence (Figure 5). From these alignments and the accompanying
residue-occurrence plots, it is clear that the residue corresponding
to H104 in StEH1 is highly conserved throughout the superfamily. The
side chain of this residue is near that of H300 (the closest atoms
are separated by only 3.3 Å in the wild-type structure), and
although the geometry is not consistent with a hydrogen bond, the
protonation states of these two residues are probably linked. For
instance, having both residues simultaneously protonated would create
large charge–charge repulsion. Our pKa calculations (Table 1) suggest that in contrast to H300, H104 is likely to be protonated
during the catalytic cycle. Protonation of either H104 or H300 would
provide charge balance in the highly negatively charged environment
of the active site, which contains three anionic residues (Figure 2). Upon examination
of the patterns seen for nearby residues (Figure 2 and Table S2),
it can be seen that even though it is possible to replace E35 with
Q without losing H104, whenever H104 is replaced by another residue,
in particular in dehalogenases, the adjacent E35 is replaced by either
a Ser or Thr, compensating for the loss of positive charge in the
active site. The combined evidence strongly suggests that H104 is
preferentially protonated in the StEH1 active site.

To further test this hypothesis,
wild-type EVB simulations were
performed with H104 in either its neutral or ionized form after separate
molecular dynamics equilibration runs for each possible protonation
state. The calculated activation and reaction free energies are summarized
in Table S3 along with the observed values.
Modeling of H104 in its neutral form results in unrealistically low
activation barriers and extreme exothermicity, with a predicted stabilization
in excess of 6 kcal·mol–1 for the alkyl–enzyme
intermediate. These results are in poor agreement with pre-steady-state
kinetic data, which suggest a stabilization of 0.2 to 1.0 kcal·mol–1 for this intermediate (see refs (4) and (6)). Similar extreme exothermicities
were described in earlier QM cluster model studies,11 which considered the equivalent of H300 (H523 in sEH) as
being neutral and did not include the counterpart of H104 (H332 in
sEH) in the model.11,20 In contrast, when H104 is protonated,
thereby introducing a positive charge into the active site, much better
agreement is obtained with the experimental results in terms of both
activation free energies and intermediate stability, as shown in Figure 6 and Tables 2 and S3. It now becomes possible to reproduce the energetics of the wild-type
enzyme as well as the trends of the series of tyrosine mutants tested
(Figure 6 and Table 2). It should be noted,
however, that in the exceptional case of the E35Q variant, the pKa of H104 is predicted to be dramatically lowered
upon removal of the adjacent negative charge (Table 1); therefore, in this instance H104 was modeled
as being deprotonated, as discussed below.

in the H300N variant, D265 is protonated, as discussed in the main
text.

3.2 Modeling the Selectivity
of StEH1
While one would not expect either regio- or enantioselectivity
in
the uncatalyzed epoxide ring opening of TSO in aqueous solution (as
the two carbons are presumably chemically indistinguishable in a symmetrical
substrate), StEH1 preferentially hydrolyzes (R,R)-TSO at pH 6.8.4 Our calculations
suggest that nucleophilic attack occurs primarily at C1 for (S,S)-TSO (ΔG1⧧ is 1.7
kcal·mol–1 lower than for attack at C2) and
at C2 for (R,R)-TSO (preferred by
3.6 kcal·mol–1) (see Table S3 and Figure 6). However, in the hydrolysis step, the barrier is substantially
higher for both enantiomers when the epoxide has been opened at C1
compared with C2. This means that trajectories following attack at
C1 are likely to be nonproductive, as return to the substrate will
be faster than the rate of hydrolysis. Therefore, we suggest that
the regioselectivity is determined in the second step of the reaction
(hydrolysis), with both enantiomers reacting through the intermediate
formed after nucleophilic attack at C2. As shown in Figure 6, this leads to good quantitative
agreement with the experimental values. It should be noted that although
we get clear regioselectivity for attack at C1 versus C2 in both steps,
we are able to reproduce the enantioselectivity only in the first
(alkylation) step because of the small energy differences and the
dependence of the energetics of the hydrolysis step on the calculated
free energy of the previous alkylation step.

To assess the role
of individual residues in determining the observed regioselectivity
in the hydrolysis step, we performed a quantitative analysis of the
electrostatic contributions of key residues to the calculated activation
barriers for hydrolysis using the linear response approximation, as
outlined in previous studies30,55 (see Figure 7A). The main contributions
come from residues H104, W106, and D265, with the latter two residues
compensating for the positive (destabilizing) contribution from H104
to the hydrolysis step. This creates an electrostatically balanced
active site, as modeling H104 as being deprotonated in the simulation
system results in very large artificial stabilization of the alkyl–enzyme
intermediate (see Table S3). Even though
the individual contributions are very similar for different pathways
(Figure 7A), the sum
of these contributions results in a larger stabilizing effect when
hydrolysis takes place in the alkyl–enzyme intermediate formed
after nucleophilic attack at C2. This arises predominantly from the
interplay between the effects of H104 and W106.

Figure 7 (A) Electrostatic contributions
of key active-site residues to
the calculated activation barrier. (B) Electrostatic contributions
from different parts of the substrate. (C) Orientation of the substrate
in the active site, illustrating the annotation used in (B). In (A)
and (B), positive values correspond to destabilizing contributions
and negative values to stabilizing contributions. For clarity, only
residues that contribute 1 kcal·mol–1 or more
to the calculated activation barrier are shown.

To probe this further, we considered the electrostatic interactions
between the protein and different parts of the substrate (Figure 7B,C). The interactions
have been separated into three groups: those coming from each of the
two benzene rings and those arising from interactions of the core
of the substrate. As expected (Figure 7B), the most important stabilizing interactions are
those between the oxyanion formed upon epoxide ring opening and its
surrounding electrostatic environment. These stabilizing interactions
are stronger by 5 to 10 kcal·mol–1 when nucleophilic
attack has taken place at C2 for both (R,R)-TSO and (S,S)-TSO (Figure 7B). This difference
in stabilization energy is similar to that obtained for the absolute
activation barrier for hydrolysis following attack at C1 versus C2
(i.e., the values obtained before correction for the calculated free
energies of the alkyl–enzyme intermediate; see Table S4). Additionally, an overlay of the TSs
for attack at C1 and C2 shows a substantial shift in one of the benzene
rings for the disfavored TS (Figure S3),
suggesting a further steric/strain contribution.

3.3 Exploring the Effect of Key Active-Site Mutations
To
further validate our calculations, we performed EVB simulations
on a series of key active-site mutants (Tables 2 and S5–S7). Figure 8 shows
that we were able to reproduce the effect of each of these mutants
with an accuracy of 1–2 kcal·mol–1 (where
experimental data are available). Our key observations are summarized
below.

Figure 8 Calculated (light color) and experimentally derived (dark color)
activation energies for the StEH1-catalyzed reactions of (A) (R,R)-TSO and (B) (S,S)-TSO. The calculated
activation free energies (ΔGcalc⧧) correspond to the
rate-limiting step for each system, with the appropriate protonation
state of H104 (see Tables 2 and S3–S6). The experimental
activation free energies (ΔGexp⧧) were derived from the
kinetic data presented in refs (4−7).60

E35Q
In the wild-type enzyme (Figure 2), the γ-carboxylate of E35 is within
hydrogen-bonding distance of the hydrolytic water molecule and H104
(although the geometry for the latter is not optimal). E35 is also
part of a hydrogen-bonding network that connects the active site with
the solvent interface, i.e., E35 → S39 → Y219 →
R41 → E215. Previous studies have demonstrated strong conservation
of E35 as well as the hydrogen-bonding network in which it is involved.6 Kinetic studies have shown that while the reaction
of the (R,R) enantiomer is affected
in both the alkylation and hydrolysis steps by this mutation, its
impact is smaller for the (S,S)
enantiomer (and is mainly in the hydrolysis step).6 Furthermore, there is a complete inversion in the pH–rate
profile for the (R,R) enantiomer,
whereas that for the (S,S) enantiomer
is only slightly shifted compared to the wild-type (Figure 4). However, what appears to
be an inverted pH profile is in fact a drastic shift of the acidic
limb to lower pH values. The cause of this shift is unclear, but it
seems reasonable to link the effect to the extremely low predicted
pKa of the H104 imidazolium, even if this
value is clearly exaggerated (Table 1). The finding that the modeled conformations of the
side chain of Q35 are different in the alkyl–enzyme complexes
of the different enantiomers (and also differ from those in the wild-type
enzyme complexes) (Figure S4) is also consistent
with the idea that the E35Q substitution affects the hydrolysis of
the TSO enantiomers differently.

In a previous simulation study,6 it was proposed that two key roles of E35 are
(1) to participate in activation of the aspartate nucleophile (presumably
by facilitating channeling of protons out of the active site) and
(2) to orient the catalytic water for optimal hydrogen bonding during
the hydrolysis half-reaction. However, these conclusions were based
on the premise that H300 is protonated and H104 is deprotonated.6 As discussed above, our EVB calculations (Tables 2 and S3) suggest that, for both enantiomers, H104
is preferentially protonated in the wild-type enzyme, creating a strong
interaction between H104 and the adjacent E35 (see Figure 2). We do not observe an interaction
between E35 and the hydrolytic water molecule in the wild-type enzyme.
It should be noted, however, that our simulations start with equilibration
of the alkyl–enzyme intermediate rather than the substrate-free
enzyme, and there is a significant charge shift in the active site
upon formation of this intermediate due to the displacement of the
negative charge on the nucleophile toward the newly formed oxyanion.
This could in turn break the interaction between E35 and the hydrolytic
water molecule.

In the E35Q variant, however, the orientation
of Q35 seems to be
heavily dependent on which substrate enantiomer is bound to the active
site. In the wild-type enzyme, the E35–H104 interaction blocks
solvent access to the active site, and in the case of the complex
of the E35Q variant with (S,S)-TSO,
solvent accessibility is similarly prevented by an interaction between
Q35 and the hydroxyl group of the tetrahedral intermediate formed
after attack by the hydrolytic water molecule (Figure S4). In the case of (R,R)-TSO, the substrate pushes Q35 out of the active site, preventing
any interaction with either H104 or the tetrahedral intermediate and
allowing solvent access to the active site. These critical structural
differences, which in turn affect the solvation of the reacting atoms,
can provide a starting point for understanding the different behaviors
of the E35Q variant toward the two enantiomers.

Y154/Y235
As shown in Figure 2, Y154 and Y235 together form an oxyanion
hole that stabilizes the oxyanion of the alkyl–enzyme intermediate
formed by epoxide ring opening, as suggested in ref (5). To explore their role
in intermediate stabilization in more detail, we modeled two single-mutant
forms of StEH1 based on the wild-type crystal structure and studied
the full reaction profiles for the hydrolysis of the two TSO enantiomers.
The calculated activation barriers are presented in Tables 2 and S5–S7. For both enantiomers, the alkylation barriers are higher for the
mutants than for the wild-type enzyme, and the energy difference between
initial nucleophilic attack at either carbon atom on the substrate
is very small. It is important to note that the experimental rates
for these mutants are based on steady-state data, and kcat may represent different properties in these mutants
compared with the wild-type enzyme or other mutants (as the rate-limiting
step may have changed from hydrolysis to alkylation). Additionally,
in the case of (R,R)-TSO, we overestimate
the activation barrier for the hydrolytic step (step II) by ca. 2
kcal·mol–1. However, it is fully plausible
that in the absence of a tyrosine residue to form the oxyanion hole
shown in Figure 2 (which
in turn stabilizes charge on the oxyanion intermediate), this oxygen
atom could become protonated earlier in the reaction cycle, thus reducing
the barrier to the hydrolytic step.

H300N and E35Q/H300N
The H300N mutant involves a substantial
perturbation of the active site, so it was fortunate that we could
solve this crystal structure. Importantly, the structure shows that
N300 takes a different side-chain conformation than H300 (Figure 2B). Additionally,
no electron density was observed for the hydrolytic water (Figure S1), indicating that its usual site is
occupied rarely in this mutant, if ever. The structure further suggests
a strong interaction between E35 and H104 that is not present in the
wild-type protein and appeared in the mutant simulations only after
the initial equilibration run (see Figure 2). Our calculations suggest that the pKa of D265 is significantly elevated in the H300N
mutant compared with the wild-type enzyme, probably because of the
missing hydrogen bond between D265 and H300 (Table 1). Experimental chemical shift data have
suggested that the corresponding histidine–aspartate pairs
in enzymes with related mechanisms, such as serine proteases, also
share a proton.56 Therefore, with H300
removed from the system, D265 could plausibly be protonated, and we
modeled it as such in our EVB calculations on this variant. The mutation
also seems to affect the protonation state of H104; a protonated H104
would unfavorably perturb the pKa of the
nearby E35.

Experimentally, this variant shows drastically reduced
kinetic efficiencies (Table S8). Because
of the low signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements of the steady-state
kinetics, it was not possible to determine kcat and KM values for this mutant,4 and therefore, the experimental values for kA detailed description of the calibration of the back3 have to be taken as lower limits. The biggest challenge with the
H300N mutant is modeling the second step of the reaction, as the conventional
general base of the enzyme has been removed and the hydrolytic water
is lacking. This complicates modeling of the second step, since it
is not clear where the needed water molecule actually lies. Although
there is no detectable activity for (S,S)-TSO, the enzyme still maintains some level of activity for the
(R,R)-TSO enantiomer, as shown in Table S8. Reasonable agreement with experimental
results for both (R,R)-TSO and (S,S)-TSO are obtained only when H104 is
deprotonated.

In the absence of H300, we posit that E35 could
act as a general
base with some efficiency. As the hydrolytic water seems to be lost,
we are not convinced a computational model of the subsequent hydrolytic
step would be very meaningful. However, we have experimentally explored
this possibility by preparing and biochemically characterizing an
E35Q/H300N double-mutant form of the enzyme. As shown in Table S8, both individual mutants have some activity
for (R,R)-TSO. The double mutant
retains the activity of the H300N single mutant for the first step
of the reaction, forming the alkyl–enzyme intermediate, but
all activity is lost in the hydrolytic step of the reaction. This
provides a clear indication that both residues are involved in the
catalytic step and, when combined with our computationally study of
the role of H104, strongly suggests that the canonical catalytic triad
should in fact be expanded to include residues E35 and H104.

4 Overview and Conclusions
The present work
describes a combined computational, biochemical,
and structural study of the hydrolysis of trans-stilbene
oxide by StEH1. The result is a concrete and unified molecular model
that for the first time explains the pH dependence of catalysis by
StEH1,6 its regiopreference, and changes
in activity and selectivity upon mutation. Among many new insights,
we have found that the regioselectivity of the reaction is determined
not at the alkylation step, as one would intuitively assume, but rather
at the subsequent hydrolytic step shown in Figure 1. This suggests that the latter reaction
step needs to be carefully examined in any computational design studies
that aim at controlling the regioselectivity of this enzyme.

In addition to the well-established contributions of the active-site
triad D105/H300/D265 and the two lid residues Y154 and Y235, we have
uncovered the vital roles of two previously neglected residues, E35
and H104, which form an ion pair and are highly conserved among epoxide
hydrolases and related hydrolytic enzymes. Our EVB calculations show
that unless H104 is included in the simulation system in its protonated
form, it is impossible to reproduce experimental trends in activities
and selectivities for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. Previous quantum-chemical
cluster calculations that did not include the equivalent of H104 (H332
in sEH)20 resulted in extreme exothermicities,
as indeed we obtained with a neutral H104.

The model presented
here also resolves the ongoing controversy
with regard to the protonation state of H300.12 Protonating either histidine would provide charge balance in the
active site, but protonation of H104 (which is linked to H300 through
the hydrolytic water molecule) rather than H300 allows for retention
of the general-base capability of the latter. All known sequences
of related hydrolytic enzymes in which H104 is replaced by a different
residue also replace the adjacent negatively charged E35 with either
Ser or Thr (Table S2), allowing charge
balance to be maintained in the active site. This strongly suggests
that our conclusions are not limited to StEH1 but rather can be extended
to other epoxide hydrolases and related hydrolytic enzymes (such as
dehalogenases) that use an Asp nucleophile. Considering different
protonation states of H104 also allows us to provide a rationale for
the unusual pH–rate profile observed upon mutation of E35 to
Q,6 as noted in other recent work.12 Removal of this negative charge most likely
results in a neutral H104 and allows Q35 to be a modulator of water
access to the StEH1 active site.

The distinction between residues
that are directly involved in
catalysis through, for instance, nucleophilic attack or proton transfer
(such as D105 and H300) and those that act by electrostatically modulating
the active site is proving to be subtle. In StEH1, the change in protonation
state of H104 in the E35Q and H300N mutations appears to play a direct
role in modulating the selectivity of the enzyme. Thus, we have shown
that electrostatic interactions from residues not directly involved
in bond-breaking or bond-making processes can still play an important
role in even reactions such as enantioselective ring opening, which
are usually considered to be dominated by steric considerations.57 This emphasizes the need for complete and accurate
enzyme models for rational computational design of enzymes of biocatalytic
interest, such as the one presented here for epoxide hydrolases.

The sequences were found
by BLAST with the
StEH1 sequence as the query, selecting annotated sequences from the
results. The residue corresponding to H104 in StEH1 is strongly conserved
(with the exceptions discussed in the main text), and when it is changed,
it is most commonly replaced by the structurally similar glutamine.


Kinetic information for the
reverse reaction
of the second step was not experimentally available, and therefore,
the calculated and experimental energetics of the tetrahedral intermediate
cannot be compared. All values were normalized to the reactant state
and are shown in kcal·mol–1. It should be noted
that the calculated free energy barrier for the second step of the
reaction is dependent on the corresponding calculated reaction free
energy of the first reaction step, so any uncertainties in this value
will also shift the calculated barrier for the second part of the
reaction.


These correspond
to kcat, which provides an upper boundary
for the rate-limiting
step and allows for direct comparison to the calculated values. The
only exception is the active-site mutant H300N, where the microscopic
rate of alkyl–enzyme intermediate hydrolysis, k3, is used because kcat is
not available for both substrates. Additionally, no experimental data
are available for the reactions of the Y235F and H300N variants of
StEH1 with (S,S)-TSO.
