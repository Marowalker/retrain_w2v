Detoxifying
enzymes such as flavin-containing monooxygenases deal
with a huge array of highly diverse xenobiotics and toxic compounds.
In addition to being of high physiological relevance, these drug-metabolizing
enzymes are useful catalysts for synthetic chemistry. Despite the
wealth of studies, the molecular basis of their relaxed substrate
selectivity remains an open question. Here, we addressed this issue
by applying a cumulative alanine mutagenesis approach to cyclohexanone
monooxygenase from Thermocrispum municipale, a flavin-dependent
Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase which we chose as a model system
because of its pronounced thermostability and substrate promiscuity.
Simultaneous removal of up to eight noncatalytic active-site side
chains including four phenylalanines had no effect on protein folding,
thermostability, and cofactor loading. We observed a linear decrease
in activity, rather than a selectivity switch, and attributed this
to a less efficient catalytic environment in the enlarged active-site
space. Time-resolved kinetic studies confirmed this interpretation.
We also determined the crystal structure of the enzyme in complex
with a mimic of the reaction intermediate that shows an unaltered
overall protein conformation. These findings led us to propose that
this cyclohexanone monooxygenase may lack a distinct substrate selection
mechanism altogether. We speculate that the main or exclusive function
of the protein shell in promiscuous enzymes might be the stabilization
and accessibility of their very reactive catalytic intermediates.

Introduction
Enzymes are traditionally
thought of as being very specific for
the particular metabolic reaction they catalyze, and molecular discrimination
between closely related compounds indeed often is an asset. However,
it is also known that some degree of substrate promiscuity is common
for most if not all enzymes, and this is assumed to be a prerequisite
for their evolution.1 There are also enzymes
equipped with an extremely broad specificity, and some of them have
become trailblazers in modern biocatalysis.2 In many cases, the underlying physiological role can explain the
selective advantage that led to the evolution of such indiscriminate
catalysts. A classic example is detoxification, a process that involves
diverse enzyme classes.3 In higher organisms,
the metabolism of drugs proceeds via an initial modification phase
involving cytochrome P450 (P450s) and flavin-containing monooxygenases
(FMOs), while transferases and ligases flag a compound for decomposition
or secretion in the subsequent conjugation phase.4 Performing these steps on a range of xenobiotics allows
these enzymes to afford a broad protection. P450s were originally
investigated because of their clinical relevance,5 but they also gained strong interest in biocatalysis and
protein engineering, due to their unique catalytic competences.6 FMOs typically oxidize heteroatoms,7 but a human isoenzyme (FMO5) recently was shown
to act as a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO),8 adding to the repertoire of the reactions catalyzed
by human detoxifying and drug/xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. BVMOs
are enzymes present in all kingdoms9 and
catalyze the incorporation of oxygen adjacent to a carbonyl moiety
via their catalytic C4a-peroxyflavin intermediate, which results from
the reaction of dioxygen (O2) and reduced flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD; Scheme 1).10

Scheme 1 Baeyer-Villiger Reaction
and Catalytic Mechanism of BVMOs Showing
the Various Oxidation States of the Flavin (Fl)
Interestingly, many characterized microbial
BVMOs also display
relaxed substrate specificities, even though they are typically thought
to have a more specialized physiological role. Cyclohexanone monooxygenase
(CHMO) from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 9871, for example,
is part of a cyclohexanol degradation pathway,11 yet this enzyme was found to convert hundreds of different
compounds.12,13 With several crystal structures14−18 and a wealth of mutagenesis data at hand,19−24 BVMOs present an excellent model for the study of substrate acceptance
and promiscuity. Engineering studies aiming at the implementation
of a BVMO for cyclohexanone conversion are particularly interesting;
the resulting product, ε-caprolactone, is a precursor for nylon-6,
a polymer produced industrially on a megaton scale.25

Several engineering attempts performed on a thermostable
BVMO which
is inactive on cyclohexanone (phenylacetone monooxygenase from Thermobifida fusca(26)) failed
to generate a promiscuous mutant capable of acting on this substrate.21−23 The only mutant of phenylacetone monooxygenase known to convert
small amounts of cyclohexanone combined mutations in the active site
with mutations discovered through an unusual approach of induced allostery.24,27 The allosteric residues are approximately 18 Å from the substrate
binding site and may lead to a domain shift resulting in the alteration
of the active-site shape.24 Conformational
flexibility can indeed contribute to enzyme promiscuity28 and could also play a role in the kinetic mechanism
of BVMOs18 as evidenced by crystal structures
of CHMO, which show a rotation of the NADP+ domain of around
3°.14 The related proteins lysine
monooxygenase and thioredoxin reductase show the same domain architecture
and were found to rotate by 30° and 67°, respectively.29,30 Although there is no structural evidence for similar movements in
BVMOs, the inefficiency of rationally engineering phenylacetone monooxygenase
might result from an incomplete picture of BVMO catalysis. Major shifts
of the cofactor,14 complex loop rearrangements,31 and the lack of an explanation for the remote
position of the conserved BVMO fingerprint motive18 leave room for speculations.

We therefore aimed to
find evidence for so far unknown mechanisms
involved in substrate preference and selectivity of BVMOs and chose
a recently described thermostable CHMO as the target for this study.32 Because a lot of experimental data on single
mutants of various CHMOs as well as phenylacetone monooxygenase can
already be found in the literature (recently reviewed in ref (33)), we undertook the uncommon
approach of creating cumulative alanine mutants. Alanine lacks a distinct
side chain and does not allow the backbone geometries of glycine.
Thus, observed effects can largely be attributed to the loss of the
wild-type side chain.34 In these minimalistic
mutants, we explored the effects of incrementally removing those groups
that shape the binding site and presumably establish favorable interactions
with the substrates. While it was previously observed that enzymes
possess backups and can compensate for the loss of some side chains
through other residues or conformations,28 accumulating mutations quickly lead to inactivation.35 It was therefore against our expectations to
observe that our radical side-chain pruning only had a strong effect
on enzyme activity when applied to a massive extent. In combination
with conclusions drawn from structural investigations, we show that
in promiscuous enzymes such as BVMOs, the accessibility to enzyme-stabilized,
yet chemically very reactive, flavin intermediates appears the main
factor that governs substrate preference.

Results
Structural
Investigations Using a Substrate Mimic to Reveal
Substrate Binding Modes
In BVMOs, the catalytic entity is
the C4a-peroxyflavin, which reacts with the substrate to form the
so-called Criegee intermediate (Scheme 1).10 Although the chemistry
behind this reaction is well understood, crystal structures of monooxygenases
with either flavin adduct are not available. It is possible that the
unsuccessful protein engineering is a direct result of the uncertainty
about the conformation of BVMOs in this critical catalytic step. Our
first goal was, therefore, to rule out that BVMOs undergo a so far
overlooked conformational change. Because both the C4a-peroxyflavin
as well as the Criegee intermediates seem too unstable to be crystallized
and/or survive the X-ray exposure, we aimed to create a mimic of the
C4a-peroxyflavin–substrate complex. In the course of our X-ray
studies on a robust CHMO from Thermocrispum municipale (TmCHMO; Figure 1a),32 we noticed that an acetate molecule
present in the crystallization medium binds in front of the C4a atom
of the flavin ring. As the Criegee intermediate is negatively charged
and TmCHMO is active on linear aliphatic ketones, we reasoned that
the carboxylate could mimic the intermediate. This idea prompted us
to carry out cocrystallization trials with various carboxylic acids.
The trials were successful with hexanoic acid, which bound to TmCHMO
both in the tunnel leading toward the active site as well as in the
active site itself (Figure 1a; Table S1). The ligand close
to the flavin bound in the same position as observed for previous
BVMO crystal structure ligands (Figure S1) and in an orientation we would expect for the Criegee intermediate.
For comparison, we computationally modeled the peroxyflavin and the
Criegee intermediate (Figure 1b,c). We found that the anionic peroxygroup stabilizes above
the pyrimidine ring of the flavin, and this position coincides with
one of the oxygen atoms of hexanoic acid in our structure (Figure 1b). The other carboxylate
oxygen of hexanoic acid points away from the flavin to hydrogen bond
with the hydrogens of the NE atom of Arg329 and of the O1 atom of
NADP+. This position was previously predicted to be occupied
by the negatively charged oxygen of the Criegee intermediate by a
theoretical study36 (Figure 1c). Importantly, we found no conformational
changes when comparing the overall protein arrangement of the TmCHMO–hexanoic
acid complex with that of previously obtained structures. The Cα-atom
root-mean-square deviation from the previously obtained structure
of TmCHMO in complex with FAD and NADP+ in the oxidized
(ligand-bound, PDB code 5M0Z) and reduced (different space group; 5M10) complexes was only
0.3 Å. We thus concluded that in the reaction outcome-determining
catalytic step of the Criegee intermediate, the enzyme is unlikely
to be in a different conformation than previously observed.

Pruning the Side Chains from the Substrate-Binding Site
Having ruled out large enzyme conformational changes during the Criegee
intermediate step, we next turned our attention to the active-site
pocket using the crystal structure as a reference. In TmCHMO, 10 residues
form the catalytic site: Leu145, Leu146, Phe248, Phe279, Arg329, Phe434,
Thr435, Leu437, Trp492, and Phe507 (Figure 2). Notably, these residues are strictly conserved
in all bona fide CHMOs, i.e., closely related enzymes
that were demonstrated to be active on cyclohexanone (Figure S2). Since it was shown that the strictly
conserved aromatic residue at positions 49220 and Arg32937 are essential for catalysis,
these two positions were excluded for mutagenesis. The remaining eight
residues were successively and cumulatively mutated to alanine. The
order was chosen arbitrarily with the exception of the last added
Leu146 and Leu437, which are within interacting distance from the
two cofactors, and Thr435, whose side chain points away from the active
site (Figure 2). Notably,
four of the targeted residues are phenylalanines, resulting in a substantial
increase in the volume of the active site upon mutation to alanine
(Figure 2). Although
the replacement of single active-site residues can lead to a more
stable enzyme,38 previous studies showed
that mutating the binding site residues in BVMOs usually slightly
decreases enzyme stability.39 Moreover,
accumulating mutations are frequently found to be deleterious in general.35 Therefore, we were expecting to encounter abolished
activity at some point, but were hoping for retained protein folding
ability.

top panel) and the 8× alanine mutant (model, bottom panel). The
left and right panels are the same scene rotated by 180°. FAD
and NADP+ are depicted in yellow and green, respectively.
All active-site residues are displayed as sticks in various colors.
The surface they create and which forms the pocket is in the same
color. In the mutant, residues that contribute to the newly shaped
pocket are also shown with gray carbons. The hexanoic acid ligand
bound in the tunnel is depicted as ball and sticks. The rest of the
protein is shown as a gray surface representation, cut open at various
planes (black). The active-site pocket is not cut, to emphasize the
volume differences between wild type and mutant. As a result, the
inner hexanoic acid ligand, bound close to the flavin (Figure 1b,c), cannot be seen.

We applied successive rounds of
site-directed mutagenesis to a
plasmid harboring the TmCHMO gene fused to a (His6)-SUMO
expression tag. This resulted in eight variants ranging from the single
(1×) mutant L145A up to the 8-fold (8×) mutant L145A/L146A/F248A/F279A/F434A/T435A/L437A/F507A
(Table S2). As they emerged in the course
of mutagenesis, we also tested three more variants corresponding to
alternative 2×, 5×, and 7× mutants (Table 1). Upon transformation in Escherichia coli, we found that all variants expressed equally
well as wild-type TmCHMO and could be purified loaded with FAD. We
determined the melting temperature (Tm) of the mutant proteins with a thermal shift assay that exploits
flavin fluorescence (ThermoFAD).40 Despite
the accumulating loss of active-site side chains, we found that the Tm gradually increased with each introduced alanine
mutation until the 5× mutant, which had a 4 °C higher Tm than wild-type TmCHMO (Figure 3a). Then, the stability slightly declined
again until the 8× mutant, which still had a 3 °C higher Tm than the wild-type enzyme. From these data,
we concluded that protein folding and stability were apparently not
affected by the mutations.

Table 1 Active-Site Residues Targeted in This
Study (Grey Field Indicates a Mutation to Alanine in the Corresponding
Variant)
We then wanted to determine
the point of abolition of catalytic
activity. To that end, we determined enzyme activity using a spectrophotometric
NADPH consumption assay, but also performed bioconversions and product
analysis via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Besides
cyclohexanone, we also used rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one,
a model substrate for the analysis of stereo- and regioselectivity
and readily converted by most BVMOs. Surprisingly, we found that none
of the mutations caused a complete loss of activity. First, the kinetic
analysis showed that the uncoupling rate, i.e., the unproductive NADPH
oxidation, was barely affected by most mutations (Figure 3b, Table S2). Measurements in the presence of rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one
or cyclohexanone, on the other hand, showed an impaired catalytic
performance: while the 1× mutant displayed a somewhat higher
activity than the wild-type enzyme, the rates quickly declined upon
accumulative loss of active-site side chains, until it became undistinguishable
from the uncoupling rate from the 4× mutant on (Figure 3b and Table S2). Likewise, the bioconversions showed the complete turnover
of 1 mM cyclohexanone in 24 h at 30 °C by all mutants up to and
including the 4× mutant, yet also approximately 10% conversion
by the 5× mutant, and trace conversions detectable up to the
8× mutant (Figure 3c). Reactions with rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one
were performed with 10 mM substrate, and while the 4× mutant
converted only traces, the two 5× (85% and 29%) and the 6×
mutant (97%) still showed high turnovers (Figure 3c). In the highest mutants, no product was
detectable at first, but when we extended the reaction time to 72
h and supplemented the conversion mix with FAD and catalase, we could
also detect traces of conversions of rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one.
These results led us to reject the hypothesis that a combination of
side chains in the active site is required for catalysis in general,
or for activity on cyclohexanone in particular. In fact, these results
indicate that none of the targeted residues is strictly essential
for either task.

We also analyzed the effect on CHMO’s
substrate promiscuity
and performed conversions with two substrate mixes. These contained
common BVMO substrates [4-octanone, phenylacetone, (+)-dihydrocarvone],
as well as substrates for noncanonical oxidations (thioanisole, benzaldehyde,
isophorone) together with compounds typically not accepted by CHMOs
[(−)-menthone, (−)-isomenthone, acetophenone, 1-indanone,
cyclopentadecanone, camphor, stanolone]. The results are summarized
in Figure 3d. The substrate
scope of wild-type TmCHMO was found to be even broader than assumed.
Besides converting cyclic substituted and linear ketones and performing
sulfoxidations, TmCHMO also oxidizes benzaldehyde and—in contrast
to CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 987141—converts aromatic ketones such as 1-indanone
and acetophenone. The only tested substrates that were not converted
were very bulky or α,β-unsaturated ketones. While previous
work already showed a high affinity of wild-type TmCHMO for some of
the assayed compounds,32 the detection
of a comparable amount of product resulting from the conversion of
the newly identified substrates suggest that their binding constants
are on the same order of magnitude. The alternative scenario, i.e.,
very high kcat and KM values, is improbable taking into account that wild-type
TmCHMO shows similar kcat values (and
thus the same rate-limiting step) with most of the assayed substrates.
In the mutants, on the other hand, the promiscuous activity gradually
vanishes. Although sulfoxidation capability and activity on cyclic
ketones is mostly retained in the highest mutants, activity on nearly
all other substrates is practically lost. The 4× mutant showed
no activity in these conversions; apparently this particular combination
of mutations is unfavorable in some conditions (presumably in the
presence of the more elevated concentration of acetonitrile used in
these reactions). Notably, for some mutants we observed an activity
on cyclopentadecanone, a transformation that was never previously
reported for a CHMO. When testing these mutants in individual conversions
with 1 mM of this bulky substrate, the 3× mutant converted approximately
60% to the corresponding lactone (Figures 3c, S3).

Because some of the substrates we used can yield two different
products depending on the side of oxygen incorporation, we could also
study the effect of the mutations on regioselectivity. We found that
if the wild-type enzyme produced exclusively the normal product (where
the oxygen is incorporated next to the more substituted carbon), the
regioselectivity remained unaffected in the mutants. When the enzyme
produced fully or partially the abnormal product, however, the selectivity
turned in favor of the normal product as more side chains were removed.
As is the case for other CHMOs,42 wild-type
TmCHMO produces exclusively the abnormal lactone from trans-(+)-dihydrocarvone. In the 1× and one of the 2× mutants,
this selectivity is retained, while all the other mutants produce
between 31 and 43% abnormal lactone. This apparent on/off mechanism
seems to depend on Phe279: if it is present, regioselective production
of the abnormal lactone occurs, while in its absence the residual
production is unselective and approximates the value found for Baeyer–Villiger
reactions via chemical oxidation.43 For
4-octanone, the abnormal production slightly increases upon the first
mutation approximating full regioselectivity but then drops to 32
and 15% in the 2× and 3× mutants. Using a whole cell assay,
we also performed conversions with 11 mM 2-butanone (Figure 3c), which yields the industrially
relevant methyl propanoate when the abnormal product is formed. We
found exclusively the normal product from the 5× mutant on (Figure 3e). Wild-type TmCHMO
converts rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one regiodivergently,
leading to the abnormal lactone from one substrate enantiomer, and
the normal lactone from the other. We found that the enzyme was able
to retain this behavior until the 6× mutant. Previous protein
engineering studies aiming to change the regioselectivity in BVMOs
often sought to rationalize the switch toward normal lactone production
by computational models.44−46 Our findings support the simple
conclusions that, in a spacious and nonspecific binding site, the
normal product is preferentially formed, leading to the same regioselectivity
as the nonenzymatic Bayer-Villiger reaction. The shift toward the
abnormal product can thereby take place only in the context of a sterically
restrained environment. A recent study used extensive computational
analysis to investigate the origin of abnormal product formation in
TmCHMO mutants and corroborates this conclusion.47

Expanding to the Active-Site Tunnel
Our results indicate
that the active-site residues are not strictly essential for catalysis
and contribute to CHMO’s substrate preference only to a limited
extent since most mutants retained a broad substrate scope with highest
activities toward cyclohexanone and thioanisole. If this selectivity
was not determined in the active site, however, it consequently would
have to be established elsewhere. A hint about this hypothesis was
given by our crystal structure of TmCHMO in complex with hexanoic
acid. The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two enzyme monomers.
Both monomers contain the hexanoic ligand in the active site, but
one of them also features a defined density for the same ligand in
the tunnel that connects the active site to the solvent (Figures 2, 4a). This tunnel has previously been observed in BVMOs,17,48 but our structure is a unique capture of a molecule along this diffusion
pathway.

were 2 μM and 10 μM for mixed and individual substrates,
respectively. (e) Stability of the ring-wise tunnel multialanine mutants;
the dashed line indicates the melting temperature of the wild-type
enzyme.

This newly emerged evidence for
the importance of the tunnel prompted
us to investigate its role in substrate acceptance. After a careful
visual inspection, we defined as tunnel residues only those amino
acids that protrude with their side chain into the path of the tunnel.
Residues contributing with their backbone only were excluded, because
mutagenesis would not affect the tunnel shape and easily disturb the
hydrophobic packing. The beginning of the tunnel was defined as the
rim at the solvent exposed outside and the end as the catalytic site
(Figures 2 and 4).

If the tunnel indeed was partially or fully
responsible for CHMO’s
activity on cyclohexanone, we hypothesized that we could also transfer
this activity by transplanting the tunnel. As an engineering target,
we chose phenylacetone monooxygenase, which is inactive on cyclohexanone
and shares 44% sequence identity with TmCHMO. Because some active-site
residues also partially contribute to the shape of the tunnel further
up, we created two variants for the transplantation approach: one
with those residues exchanged that only form the tunnel, and one in
which also the entire catalytic site was exchanged (Tables S3–S5). The latter mutant included the double
deletion of Ser441 and Ala442, the so-called active-site “bulge”
present in phenylacetone monooxygenase,21 and two mutations corresponding to amino acids that only contribute
to the active site found in phenylacetone monooxygenase (Ile339 and
Leu340). Similarly, Phe250 does not contribute to the tunnel in TmCHMO,
but because the corresponding Arg258 in phenylacetone monooxygenase
does, it was also exchanged in both variants. The two enzymes furthermore
display several glycine insertions and deletions in the tunnel and/or
the active site, and those were also exchanged (details can be found
in the Supporting Information). The resulting
25× and 38× mutant genes of phenylacetone monooxygenase
were ordered as synthetic genes, cloned and transformed, and expressed
in E. coli. We found expression and flavin incorporation
unaffected, but when we tried the proteins in bioconversions, only
the 25× mutant showed minor activity with rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one, which was converted to the two normal
lactones (Table S6). No activity was found
with any of the other substrates. Clearly, simply transplanting the
tunnel-surface residues from one enzyme to the other was not causing
a transfer of substrate selectivity. On the other hand, it is remarkable
that such an overwhelming set of mutations did not abolish FAD binding
and protein stability (Table S6), highlighting
a remarkable degree of structural tolerance featured by the BVMO protein
scaffold.

As a second strategy, we followed our previous approach
of cumulative
alanine substitutions. We dissected the tunnel in five ring-like sections,
because a mutation of all residues to alanine at once was likely to
lead to insoluble protein. Each section contained 5–10 residues,
and those were simultaneously mutated to alanine (Figure 4a). We created the plasmids
using a PCR based method using mutated primers and subsequent Gibson
assembly.49 The proteins expressed well
with incorporated flavin. The more external ring-1 residues turned
out to have little influence on the enzyme properties (Figure 4b,c). Conversely, the other
mutants were mostly inactive on substituted cyclic, aromatic, and
linear ketones. However, they retained a high activity on cyclohexanone
and moderate activities on thioanisole, rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one,
4-octanone, and acetophenone (Figure 4c). In the case of ring 3, the mutant was unable to
convert more than small amounts of rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one
(Figure 4c), but it
gained weak activity on cyclopentadecanone (Figure 4b), possibly indicating that this particular
part of the tunnel presents a bottleneck for the entry of bulky substrates.
Low activity on rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one
was also found for the ring 2 multiple-Ala mutant, but this could
result from its decreased stability (Figure 4d). The regioselectivity remained relatively
unaffected in these mutants (Figure 4c). In general, these experiments followed the same
trend observed for the active-site poly-Ala mutants. Introducing multiple
alanine residues on the tunnel wall does not affect the preference
for cyclohexanone, thioanisole, and rac-bicyclo-[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one,
which remain the best substrates for all mutants despite their small
bulkiness.

Influence on the Flavin-Peroxide Stabilization
For
a more in-depth understanding of the effect of side-chain pruning
on the catalytic cycle, we used a stopped-flow spectrophotometer to
study both the reductive and oxidative half-reactions of the 6×
variant, which is the highest mutagenized enzyme variant with well
detectable activity (Figure 3). The mutant became fully reduced in the presence of NADPH
under anaerobic conditions, as evidenced by the loss of the absorbance
peak at 440 nm (Figure S4). The stopped-flow
traces at 440 nm were best fit to a double exponential function with
an initial faster phase accounting for 71% of the total absorbance
change. The corresponding kred1 and kred2 values were 0.2 and 0.02 s–1, respectively. These data can be compared with the stopped-flow
traces at 440 nm for wild-type TmCHMO, which were best fit to a triple
exponential function with kred values
of 30, 2, and 0.1 s–1. The Kd value for NADPH was too small to be determined under pseudo-first-order
conditions (≥5-fold excess of NADPH over enzyme) for both the
6× and wild-type enzymes. To study the oxidative half-reaction,
the 6× variant was anaerobically mixed with a stoichiometric
amount of NADPH. Next, the resulting two-electron reduced enzyme was
reacted with an air-saturated buffer resulting in an immediate increase
in absorbance at 440 nm (Figure S4). The
trace was best fit to a double exponential function corresponding
to rates of 0.4 and 0.1 s–1. Differently from wild-type
TmCHMO,32 a stable C4a-peroxyflavin with
an absorption maximum at around 355 nm was not observed in the 6×
variant at either 25 or 4 °C, most likely because its decay is
faster than its formation. Collectively, these experiments showed
that both the reductive and the oxidative half-reactions are impaired
in the 6× variant. This may be due to a nonoptimal position of
the NADPH in the enzyme, which hampers both hydride transfer and stabilization
of the C4a-peroxyflavin. Nevertheless, the mutants must retain some
stabilization of the C4a-peroxyflavin (documented by the detection
of Baeyer–Villiger reaction products in the above bioconversions; Figures 3 and 4), giving further evidence that the intermediate is above
all stabilized by the bound NADP+, potentially supported
by residues at the flavin’s si side.

Discussion
Our results from the mutagenesis of the active site and the tunnel
collectively suggest that we were not targeting a structural entity
that is fully responsible for the selectivity differences in BVMOs.
Although similar approaches to our tunnel transplantation attempt
have failed also in other cases,50 our
section-wise “alanization” clearly shows the retention
of activity with cyclohexanone and other good substrates. Although
we observe decreased substrate promiscuity, these effects are likely
to stem from an overall reduced catalytic efficiency, as evidenced
by the reduced observed rates. Since the activity on cyclohexanone
is not overwhelmingly determined by CHMO’s active site or tunnel,
it is possible that there is another, more remote substrate recognition
and filter site. This could potentially also involve protein dynamics
that previous BVMO structures were simply unable to capture. The second
and—according to Occam’s razor—more likely possibility
is that CHMOs simply lack a selection mechanism entirely. Both BVMOs
and flavin-containing monooxygenases were previously described as
“cocked guns,”51 giving credit
to their continuous stabilization of the C4a-peroxyflavin, which readily
reacts with any substrate reaching the active site. Our experiments
expand the idea to a “cocked shotgun” and suggest that
enzymes like CHMO simply provide a scaffold to stabilize the reactive
cofactor, and potentially lack a specific mechanism for substrate
uptake and acceptance entirely. The only filter would then be the
size of the active site and the increasing hydrophobicity toward the
inside. Because most biological metabolites are polar, this rather
crude selection of favoring partition from the solvent might be sufficient
to prevent these enzymes from unwanted cellular reactions.

Promiscuous
activity on polar compounds can easily interfere with
primary metabolism; thus, enzymatic activity on such molecules needs
to be more tightly regulated. On the one hand, enzymes can evolve
specific mechanisms that limit broad specificity, as is the case for
BVMO-related hydroxylases/monooxygenases.52 Accumulation of paralogs with a more restricted substrate scope
can achieve diversity without complete unspecificity, as could for
example be the case for a set of BVMOs found in a single plant biomass-degrading
bacterial species.41,53 On the other hand, expression
of promiscuous isoforms can be restricted to certain tissues,54 or regulation can occur through wide substrate-dependent
variations in the catalytic rate, as has been observed for detoxifying
paraoxonases.55 An “excluding rather
than binding” mechanism as we show is the case for some BVMOs,
however, could well be the case for many catabolic or detoxifying
enzymes which show high promiscuity toward hydrophobic substrates,
such as flavin-containing monooxygenases56 or cytochrome P450s.57 Our completely
“alanized” active-site mutant of TmCHMO can also be
a useful starting point for engineering novel activities, since it
can be regarded as a minimal active-site scaffold.
