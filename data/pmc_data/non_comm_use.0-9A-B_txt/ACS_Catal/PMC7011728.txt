Dye-sensitized
photoelectrochemical (DSPEC) cells are an emerging approach to producing
solar fuels. The recent development of delafossite CuCrO2 as a p-type semiconductor has enabled H2 generation through
the coassembly of catalyst and dye components. Here, we present a
CuCrO2 electrode based on a high-surface-area inverse opal
(IO) architecture with benchmark performance in DSPEC H2 generation. Coimmobilization of a phosphonated diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP-P) or perylene monoimide (PMI-P) dye
with a phosphonated molecular Ni catalyst (NiP) demonstrates
the ability of IO-CuCrO2 to photogenerate H2. A positive photocurrent onset potential of approximately +0.8 V
vs RHE was achieved with these photocathodes. The DPP-P-based photoelectrodes delivered photocurrents of −18 μA
cm–2 and generated 160 ± 24 nmol of H2 cm–2, whereas the PMI-P-based photocathodes
displayed higher photocurrents of −25 μA cm–2 and produced 215 ± 10 nmol of H2 cm–2 at 0.0 V vs RHE over the course of 2 h under visible light illumination
(100 mW cm–2, AM 1.5G, λ > 420 nm, 25 °C).
The high performance of the PMI-constructed system is attributed to
the well-suited molecular structure and photophysical properties for
p-type sensitization. These precious-metal-free photocathodes highlight
the benefits of using bespoke IO-CuCrO2 electrodes as well
as the important role of the molecular dye structure in DSPEC fuel
synthesis.

Introduction
Solar conversion of
water into chemical energy carriers offers a sustainable alternative
to fossil fuels.1−3 Dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical (DSPEC) cells
featuring molecular catalysts are a promising technology for solar
water splitting due to their engineering flexibility, easy modification,
and assembly.4−8 In these systems, semiconductor-immobilized molecular dyes harvest
solar light and transfer charge to a catalytic site, facilitating
the synthesis of solar fuels. Significant progress with dye-sensitized
photocathodes (DSPCs) and photoanodes has been made possible through
a deeper understanding of charge transfer processes and performance-limiting
recombination routes.9−18 Although efficiency has improved in recent years, DSPCs still suffer
from low photocurrents and poor catalytic activity, representing a
bottleneck in state of the art DSPEC devices.

In DSPCs, light
absorption by the dye is typically followed by hole injection into
the semiconductor, creating a reduced dye that can transfer an electron
to the coimmobilized catalyst. The steady-state photocurrent is representative
of the kinetic interplay between productive charge transfer and detrimental
recombination pathways. Therefore, higher photocurrents can be achieved
by blocking the dominant recombination mechanisms between holes in
the p-type semiconductor and (1) the reduced dye (geminate recombination)
or (2) the reduced catalyst.19−25

Methods to minimize catalyst recombination in DSPCs through
layer-by-layer assemblies26−29 and molecular dye–catalyst dyad complexes30−37 have shown some success, but the photocatalytic activity is still
limited. Modular assembly through a coimmobilization route is generally
preferred, as it provides flexibility in the construction of the electrode,
avoiding complex synthetic modification and permitting the use of
already established molecular species.38 The undesirable geminate recombination pathway can be rationally
addressed through engineering of the dye structure. Charge transfer
from an immobilized dye to a semiconductor is highly dependent on
the spatial separation.39−43 Consequently, localizing charge density in the photoreduced dye
(i.e., the ground state LUMO) away from the semiconductor surface
reduces charge recombination kinetics. Such strategies have proven
beneficial in p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSSCs) to effectively
increase the photocurrent and photovoltage.16,44,45 In particular, organic dyes have proven
to be proficient rivals to conventional precious-metal dyes, commonly
displaying favorable qualities for p-type sensitization such as high
extinction coefficients and internal acceptor units.16,46−48 The two dyes used in this study are based on diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP) and perylene monoimide (PMI) chromophores, both of which exhibit
beneficial characteristics for incorporation in DSPCs.

Nonetheless,
the key component in both recombination routes is the semiconductor.
NiO is currently the dominant wide-bandgap p-type semiconductor in
DSPCs owing to simple preparation using solution-based techniques.26,49−52 However, problems associated with the high density of traps and
low hole mobility have been identified,53−55 which account for the
scarcity of reports of H2 generation with coimmobilized
dye and catalyst components.20,21,38,56−59 Improved DSPCs can be realized
through the development of alternative wide-bandgap p-type semiconductors.
Delafossite structures are suitable candidates due to their solution
processability, high hole mobility, and metal oxide character.60−63 CuGaO2 and CuCrO2 have been employed in DSPCs,
both enabling an early photocurrent onset due to their highly anodic
valence band positions.32,64−66 In particular, CuCrO2 formed using a sol–gel method
was able to generate H2 in a coimmobilized molecular dye/catalyst
assembly.64 The DSPC outperformed an analogous
NiO-based photocathode, but low dye and catalyst loadings limited
product generation. This issue can in principle be addressed through
development of meso- and macroporous architectures such as inverse
opal (IO) structures, which has previously proven effective for the
incorporation of dye and catalyst components on metal oxides.27,28,67−75

Here, IO-CuCrO2 electrodes are reported through
a bottom-up templating method using organic microsphere templates
and delafossite CuCrO2 particles. Two organic dyes (DPP-P76 and PMI-P,77Figure 1) were explored in this study and coimmobilized with a DuBois-type
molecular Ni catalyst78−82 (NiP, Figure 1). Photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 generation was
used to demonstrate the influence of the novel CuCrO2 morphology
and dye structure on performance.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of IO-CuCrO2 Electrodes
IO-CuCrO2 electrodes were
constructed using a bottom-up templating method using mixtures of
preformed CuCrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with polystyrene (PS)
beads (750 nm diameter). CuCrO2-NPs were synthesized using
a modified hydrothermal synthesis procedure.83 In brief, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (6.25
mmol) and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (6.25
mmol) were stirred in Milli-Q H2O (70 mL) and NaOH (5 g)
was added. The resulting alkaline solution was placed in a PTFE-lined
autoclave and heated to 240 °C for 60 h. The NPs were washed
consecutively with dilute HCl and EtOH three times and then dried
in vacuo. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that
crystalline particles of approximately 15 nm in length and 5 nm in
diameter were obtained (Figure S1) with
a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 86 m2 g–1. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
confirmed the 3R delafossite structure (Figure S2).

The CuCrO2-NPs were dispersed in a 4/1
H2O/MeOH mixture through sonication. The PS beads were
washed with MeOH, and a portion of the CuCrO2-NP mixture
was added. The dispersion was sonicated and drop-cast on precleaned
ITO-coated glass confined to a circular area with Parafilm and left
to dry under ambient conditions. The Parafilm was removed, and the
PS template was dissolved in toluene. The films were subsequently
washed with acetone and dried before being sintered at 500 °C
for 1 h under argon. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed
that the IO-CuCrO2 films were approximately 2 μm
thick with macropores roughly 600–700 nm in diameter (Figure 2a,b). XRD patterns
of the IO-CuCrO2 films displayed peaks consistent with
the 3R delafossite polytype (Figure S2).

Dye and Catalyst Properties
DPP-P,76PMI-P,77 and NiP(78) were synthesized
as previously reported. The phosphonic acid anchoring groups facilitate
immobilization on metal oxide surfaces, and both dyes have previously
been employed in colloidal dye-sensitized photocatalysis systems with
TiO2-NPs and NiP using sacrificial reagents.76,77,84DPP-P was previously
shown to be an effective dye in a CuCrO2 photocathode with NiP and is therefore a suitable choice for comparative purposes
in this study.64 PMI dyes are renowned
for their high stability and intense visible light absorption.45 PMI-based photocathodes have been established
with heterogeneous catalysts85 and with
molecular catalysts in solution,86 but
no examples with an immobilized molecular catalyst currently exist.

The two dyes exhibit similar electrochemical properties in solution
(Table S1). Importantly, both dye anions
exhibit sufficient thermodynamic driving force (Edye/dye– ≈ −0.7 V vs RHE)
to reduce NiP to a catalytically active state (ENiP,onset = −0.21 V vs RHE).78 Hole injection into the valence band of CuCrO2 (Efb ≈ +1.0 V vs RHE)
is facilitated by the highly anodic excited state reduction potentials
(EDPP-P*/DPP-P– = +1.57 V vs RHE and EPMI-P*/PMI-P– = +1.47 V vs RHE).64,87PMI-P displays a broad and intense absorption signal
from 450 to 600 nm with a maximum at 536 nm (εmax = 3.8 × 104 M–1 cm–1, E00 = 2.20 eV) and a shoulder at 500
nm in solution-based UV–vis spectra. DPP-P also
displays a broad absorption signal (425–550 nm) with a maximum
centered at 496 nm (εmax = 2.6 × 104 M–1 cm–1, E00 = 2.27 eV) (Figure S3).

The intense visible light absorption and favorable electrochemical
properties for both dyes are well-suited for application in DSPCs
with NiP as the catalyst. To assess their ability to
reduce the immobilized catalyst, photocathodes were assembled for
PEC analysis.

Photocathode Assembly
Photocathodes
were constructed through sequential anchoring of the dye followed
by the catalyst. IO-CuCrO2 electrodes were soaked in a
solution of PMI-P or DPP-P (0.2 mM, DMF,
15 h) before rinsing with DMF and then H2O. The resulting
IO-CuCrO2|dye electrodes were dried under N2 and then immersed in a NiP solution (1 mM, MeOH, 3
h) under a N2 atmosphere to form IO-CuCrO2|dye/NiP electrodes (see the Experimental Section for details).

The color of the IO-CuCrO2 electrodes
changed from light green to red or orange for the PMI-P- or DPP-P-sensitized electrodes, respectively (Figure 2c). UV–vis
spectra of the films showed the characteristic visible light absorption
profiles of the dyes. IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P electrodes
displayed higher intensity for the peak at 500 nm than at 536 nm as
opposed to the solution-based experiments—this could be attributed
to the underlying absorption of CuCrO2 or to the presence
of aggregates (Figure 2d).77,88

The loading of each dye was quantified
following desorption in basic solution by electronic absorption spectrophotometry,
and the amount of catalyst was determined using inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Table S2). The high-surface-area IO-CuCrO2 electrodes
loaded approximately 20 nmol cm–2 of the combined
molecular species with a dye/catalyst ratio of approximately 3/1.
The loading corresponds to a 5-fold increase over the previously reported
sol–gel CuCrO2 electrodes (loading approximately
4 nmol cm–2).64

Photoelectrochemical
H2 Generation
PEC analysis was conducted in aqueous
Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M, pH 3) under chopped
visible light illumination (100 mW cm–2, AM 1.5G,
λ > 420 nm). Mildly acidic conditions are optimal for the
catalytic H2 generation performance of NiP.78,89,90 Linear sweep
voltammograms (LSVs) showed that cathodic photocurrents were obtained
for IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP and IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP electrodes with an onset
potential of approximately +0.8 V vs RHE (Figure 3a). Chronoamperometry analysis conducted
at 0.0 V vs RHE displayed higher photocurrents for the PMI-P photocathodes (j ≈ −25 μA cm–2) than the corresponding DPP-P electrodes
(j ≈ −18 μA cm–2) (Figure 3b). The
enhancement can be assigned to the red-shifted, more intense, and
broader absorption profile of the PMI dye.

analysis of IO-CuCrO2 electrodes at 0.0 V vs RHE. (c) IPCE
plots of IO-CuCrO2 electrodes at +0.3 V vs RHE with monochromatic
light intensity maintained at 0.8 mW cm–2. Conditions
(a–c): aqueous Na2SO4 (0.1 M, pH 3),
chopped visible light illumination (100 mW cm–2,
AM 1.5G, λ > 420 nm), scan rate 5 mV s–1 for voltammograms, 25 °C cell temperature maintained. A geometric
electrode area of 0.25 cm2 was used for all experiments.

Transient photocurrent spikes were observed for
both photocathodes, which are representative of charge accumulation
at the semiconductor/electrolyte solution interface. Previous systems
have also associated such spikes with recombination,36,91 but the exact origin is not easily identifiable because both dominant
recombination routes can contribute to the effect. In this study,
the PMI-P-based photocathodes generate the highest cathodic
spikes, suggesting substantial charge accumulation at the interface.
Kinetic modeling could provide further insight into the exact mechanism
and has been successfully applied in similar systems92 but is beyond the scope of the current study.

All
electrodes displayed a dark current previously assigned to a CuII/I redox couple and associated oxygen intercalation in LSVs.64,93 Interestingly, the dark current decreased upon immobilization of
the individual dye and catalyst components (Figure S4) and the same effect was observed upon anchoring of an insulating
organic molecule (phenylphosphonic acid) (Figure S5). The result agrees with a likely binding mechanism through
M–O–P bonds,94 which shields
the Cu sites from the electrolyte solution, thus lowering the observed
redox signal.

Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) measurements resembled the UV–vis spectra for each dye
(Figure 3c). The inversion
in peak maxima for the IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP photocathodes in comparison with the solution absorption
suggests that aggregates contribute to photocurrent in this arrangement.
Although often associated with adverse effects, aggregation due to
π–π stacking of PMI units in related dye-sensitized
systems has recently been shown to mediate charge separation on long
time scales.95 A similar effect relating
to charge accumulation on the PMI units could favor charge transfer
and contribute to the photocurrent in this case. The higher values
for PMI-P electrodes are representative of higher catalytic
activity due to the greater degree of visible light absorption.

Controlled-potential photoelectrolysis (CPPE) was required to confirm
the origin of the photocurrent. CPPE experiments were conducted with
each electrode at applied potentials of 0.0 and +0.3 V vs RHE in aqueous
Na2SO4 (0.1 M, pH 3) over the course of 2 h
under constant light illumination (100 mW cm–2,
AM 1.5G, λ > 420 nm) (Table 1 and Figure S6). IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP and IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP photocathodes generated appreciable
amounts of H2 at each applied potential, with the highest
activity observed at 0.0 V vs RHE. IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP electrodes generated 215 ± 10 nmol of H2 cm–2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of
41 ± 8%, giving a turnover number for NiP (TONNiP) of 48 ± 2. IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP showed slightly lower performance, generating 160
± 24 nmol of H2 cm–2 with a FE of
40 ± 14% and a TONNiP of 36 ± 5. No H2 was detected for IO-CuCrO2, IO-CuCrO2|dye,
or IO-CuCrO2|NiP electrodes, confirming the
need for both dye and catalyst molecules for catalysis. These control
experiments also rule out any contribution from electrode-derived
heterogeneous catalysts as previously observed in other systems.96 The modest FE is at least partially attributed
to the persistent dark current originating from the CuII/I redox couple.64,93

determined from ICP-OES measurements.

Postcatalysis ICP-OES showed that approximately 85%
and 75% of the initial NiP loaded was retained on the
surface of IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP and IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP electrodes,
respectively (Table S2). Corresponding
sol–gel derived CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP photocathodes preserved only 50% of the catalyst, suggesting
that the immobilized NiP is stabilized against desorption
by the IO-CuCrO2 structures.

Comparison with State of
the Art
The photocathodes presented here display high activities
for coimmobilized molecular DSPCs. Incorporation of a coumarin 343
dye coimmobilized with a bimetallic iron-based catalyst on NiO generated
photocurrents of −10 μA cm–2 at +0.16
V vs RHE with a FE of 50% but was extremely short lived due to degradation
of the catalyst with a final TON ≤ 3.57 A cobalt diimine-dioxime system featuring a coanchored push–pull
dye on NiO generated photocurrents of −7.5 μA cm–2 at +0.14 V vs RHE, producing H2 with an
FE of 10%.38 Immobilization of the same
push–pull dye with a cobaloxime catalyst on CuGaO2 boosted H2 generation, increasing the FE to 74%; this
further stresses the importance of altering the semiconductor unit
in DSPCs.66 The high photocurrents, FEs,
and TONs of the PMI-P (−25 μA cm–2, FE = 41%, TON = 48) and DPP-P (−18 μA
cm–2, FE = 40%, TON = 36) photocathodes presented
here highlight the benefits of using CuCrO2. Furthermore,
the first example of a PMI-sensitized DSPC with an immobilized molecular
catalyst is presented. The high performance of the PMI system directs
research toward modification of similar chromophores that benefit
from high extinction coefficients and favorable structural properties
for sensitization of p-type semiconductors.

NiP has previously been incorporated as the catalyst in DSPCs. Layer-by-layer
assembly of a phosphonated Ru-polypyridyl dye and NiP on NiO using a ZrIV linker facilitated H2 generation
but with low activity.26 Incorporation
of a donor–dye–catalyst assembly with a Ru-based dye
reported photocurrents of −56 μA cm–2 at +0.05 V vs RHE with a TON of ∼16 and an FE of 53%.27 A subsequent trilayered NiO/ITO assembly without
the donor assembly enhanced the FE to 90%.28 The PMI and DPP photocathodes in the current study avoid precious-metal
components but retain high activity. Although not as efficient as
the best Ru-dye NiP-based examples, they are competitive
despite the simple coimmobilization strategy. Layer-by-layer assemblies
using organic dyes with CuCrO2 could further reduce catalyst
recombination to enhance activity in future studies.

The benefits
of modifying NiO through doping and defect passivation/elimination
has been outlined in previous reports.28,97,98 Similar improvements to CuCrO2 electrodes
are expected to result in enhanced performance. Here, the development
of our previous CuCrO2 system through altering the semiconductor
morphology increased photocurrents and product yields. The amount
of H2 generated is 70% higher with the IO-CuCrO2 electrodes, the enhanced performance being assigned to higher molecular
loadings (500% increase) of dye and catalyst in the extended IO network.
The sustained photocurrent of the IO-CuCrO2 photocathode
is approximately twice that of the previous CuCrO2 system;
however, the lower TON achieved is likely due to a significant amount
of each species that is grafted on the electrode but does not contribute
to catalysis. Significant light scattering/absorption of the IO films
is another likely cause, where light harvesting from dye molecules
buried within the film is highly limited. The issue could be addressed
through pore size modification and thickness control to rationally
tailor the IO network for a specific dye/catalyst combination without
significantly reducing the molecular loading. Similar approaches to
increase the surface area could prove effective with other p-type
semiconductors in future studies.

The advantage of bypassing
synthetically challenging complexes through coimmobilization increases
the diversity of available photocathodes. Well-studied organic chromophores
such as the two employed here can be integrated with the established
range of Earth-abundant molecular catalysts,1 enabling inexpensive and efficient reduction reactions. Future developments
of dye–catalyst assemblies based on IO-CuCrO2 could
provide an understanding of the catalysis-limiting processes in DSPCs.

Conclusions
We report two inverse opal CuCrO2 photocathodes using different organic dyes with a coimmobilized
molecular Ni bis(diphosphine) catalyst. The IO architecture enables
high loadings of molecular species, resulting in a 70% enhancement
in H2 generation over a previously reported analogous sol–gel
CuCrO2 photocathode. This PMI-sensitized CuCrO2 electrode benefits from a broad and intense absorption profile,
ensuring that a large portion of visible light can be effectively
harvested. Both IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP and IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP photocathodes
generate photocurrents of −25 and −18 μA cm–2, respectively, at 0.0 V vs. RHE under visible light
illumination (100 mW cm–2, AM 1.5G, λ >
420 nm). The photocurrent onset potential was approximately +0.8 V
vs RHE for both architectures. DPP-P- and PMI-P-sensitized photocathodes produce appreciable amounts of H2 over the course of 2 h CPPE. The IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP photoelectrodes perform best, producing 215 ±
10 nmol of H2 cm–2 at 0.0 V vs RHE with
an FE of 41 ± 8% and a TONNiP of 48 ± 2. Under
the same conditions, IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP generates 160 ± 24 nmol of H2 cm–2 with a FE of 40 ± 14% and a TONNiP of 36 ±
5. The high performance of PMI-P reflects the favorable
molecular structure and absorption spectrum, which is well-suited
for sensitization of p-type semiconductors.

The novel IO-CuCrO2 morphology emphasizes the importance of high-surface-area
structures and more suitable p-type semiconductors in DSPCs. Coimmobilization
of catalyst and dye components proves to be a viable method to form
DSPCs with CuCrO2, avoiding the need for a complicated
synthetic protocol. Furthermore, the procedure enables control over
pore size through the use of different-sized template spheres, which
could assist the development of DSPCs in future studies. Integration
of CO2 reduction catalysts and development of dyes tailored
for this CuCrO2 surface could provide vital advancements
for delafossite-based photocathodes. The novel and transferable IO-CuCrO2 structure presented here extends the range of materials available
for fuel-generating DSPCs.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
NiP,78DPP-P,76 and PMI-P(77) were synthesized as previously reported. Milli-Q
H2O (R > 18.2 MΩ cm) was used
for all electrochemical and analytical measurements. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%),
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich,
≥99%), and anhydrous NaOH pellets (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%)
were used for the CuCrO2-NP preparation.83 PS beads (Polysciences Inc., 750 nm, 2.6% w/v) were used
for IO-CuCrO2 synthesis. ITO-coated glass sheets (Vision
Tek Systems Ltd., R = 12 Ω cm–2, thickness of 1.1 mm) were cut into 1 × 3 cm2 slides
prior to cleaning.

Synthesis of CuCrO2-NPs
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (1.51 g, 6.25
mmol) and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (2.50
g, 6.25 mmol) were stirred in Milli-Q H2O (70 mL), and
NaOH (5.0 g) was added (final solution pH 13). The solution was stirred
at room temperature for 2 h, and then 12 mL was decanted into a PTFE-lined
autoclave (23 mL total volume). The autoclave was heated to 240 °C
for 60 h before the CuCrO2-NPs were removed. The particles
were washed with HCl (0.1 M, 15 mL) and centrifuged (8000 rpm, 5 min),
and the supernatant was removed. They were then washed with EtOH (15
mL) and recentrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The washing
steps were repeated for a total of three washes before the CuCrO2-NPs were dried in vacuo. The dry NPs were ground using a
pestle and mortar and stored under vacuum before use.

Synthesis of
IO-CuCrO2 Electrodes
PS beads (750 nm, 2.6% w/v
suspension in H2O, 0.5 mL) were centrifuged, and the supernatant
was removed; the beads were then washed with MeOH and centrifuged
again to give a PS pellet. A dispersion of CuCrO2-NPs (7.5
wt %, MeOH/H2O 1/4, 140 μL) was added to the PS pellet
and sonicated (5 min at <10 °C). The solution was drop-cast
(4 μL) on ITO-coated glass (0.5 cm2, confined with
Parafilm) and dried in air for 3 h. The Parafilm was removed and the
PS template dissolved in toluene for 15 h before being rinsed with
acetone then H2O and dried in vacuo. Annealing under Ar
(500 °C, 5 °C min–1 ramp rate, 1 h, 150
sccm flow rate) using a tube furnace fitted with a quartz tube, end
seals, and insulation plugs (Carbolite Gero) was required to sinter
the particles to form the final IO-CuCrO2 structures.

Physical Characterization
A Tescan MIRA3 FEG-SEM was used
to obtain all SEM images. TEM analysis was conducted using a FEI Phillips
Technai F20-G2 TEM, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV
(Electron Microscopy Suite, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge).
XRD measurements were taken with a PANalytical BV X’Pert Pro
X-ray diffractometer. UV–vis absorption spectra were acquired
using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer operated in transmission
mode or with a diffuse reflectance accessory (Barrelino) for powder
samples. Emission spectra were recorded on a Fluoromax-4 Horiba Jobin
Yvon spectrofluorimeter (PMI) or with an Edinburgh Instruments FS5
spectrofluorimeter (DPP). N2 gas adsorption measurements
were carried out using a Micromeritics 3 Flex instrument (Micromeritics,
Norcross, GA, USA) with powder samples. Samples were degassed for
10 h at 100 °C, and measurements were carried out in liquid N2. BET specific surface area values were obtained from fitting
N2 isotherms using the Microactive software.

Immobilization
of Dyes and Catalyst
The dye species were immobilized through
soaking in a bath containing DPP-P or PMI-P (0.2 mM) for 15 h in DMF, maintained at 25 °C. The IO-CuCrO2|dye electrodes were rinsed with DMF and water before being
dried under N2. These electrodes were then soaked in NiP (1 mM, MeOH) for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere.
The IO-CuCrO2|dye/NiP electrodes were rinsed
with MeOH and then water and dried under N2 in the dark.
All electrodes were used directly after immobilization. A bare IO-CuCrO2 electrode was soaked in a solution of phenylphosphonic acid
(0.5 M, DMF) for 2 h and then rinsed with DMF and H2O for
the comparative dark current study.

Quantification of Immobilized DPP-P and NiP
DPP-P and PMI-P loadings were quantified using UV–vis spectroscopy
following desorption from IO-CuCrO2|dye/NiP electrodes by scraping the CuCrO2-NP powder from the
surface (0.25 cm2) and sonicating in tetrabutylammonium
hydroxide (TBAOH) 30-hydrate (0.1 M, DMF, 1 mL) for 30 min. Higher
TBAOH concentrations and longer sonication times were avoided to prevent
dye decomposition. The absorption maximum at 500 and 536 nm for DPP-P and PMI-P electrodes, respectively, was
determined and fitted to a calibration curve (conducted in 0.1 M TBAOH
in DMF) to determine the loading values. NiP loading
was determined by ICP-OES following overnight digestion of the electrodes
(0.25 cm2) in aqueous HNO3 (70%, 1 mL) and subsequent
dilution to 10% v/v with Milli-Q H2O. Values for nitric
acid solution, IO-CuCrO2, IO-CuCrO2|DPP-P, IO-CuCrO2|PMI-P, and pre- and postelectrolysis
CuCrO2|DPP-P/NiP and CuCrO2|PMI-P/NiP electrodes were determined
in triplicate.

Photoelectrochemical Measurements
PEC measurements were conducted using an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat
in a custom two-compartment electrochemical cell featuring a flat
quartz window and a Nafion membrane. A three-electrode setup was used
with a Pt counter electrode, Ag/AgCl/KClsat reference electrode,
and an IO-CuCrO2-based working electrode (0.25 cm2 active area). N2-purged (15 min) aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte solution (0.1 M, pH 3) was used for all
measurements. Electrodes were illuminated from the front using a calibrated
Newport Oriel solar light simulator (150 W, 100 mW cm–2, AM 1.5G) with an IR water filter and a UQG Optics UV-Filter (λ
> 420 nm).

CPPE experiments with each photocathode were conducted
in triplicate at +0.3 and 0.0 V vs RHE in a custom two-compartment
electrochemical cell featuring a flat quartz window and a Nafion membrane.
Both compartments were purged with 2% CH4 in N2 for 30 min prior to electrolysis, and the amount of H2 was determined using a Shimadzu Tracera GC2010 Plus gas chromatograph
using a barrier ionization discharge detector and a molsieve column
(kept at 130 °C) with He as the carrier gas. All PEC cells were
left for 2 h following electrolysis to allow solution-dissolved H2 to equilibrate with the gas headspace. The partial pressure
of H2 was calculated to account for dissolved gas in the
solution, and this was added to the amount of H2 in the
headspace to determine the total H2 and Faradaic efficiency.

IPCE Measurements
A three-electrode setup with a Pt counter
electrode, Ag/AgCl/KClsat reference electrode, and an IO-CuCrO2|dye/NiP or IO-CuCrO2 working electrode
was used in a custom three-necked cell with a flat borosilicate glass
window for IPCE measurements. The electrolyte solution was Na2SO4 (0.1 M, pH 3), and an applied potential of
+0.3 V vs RHE was maintained for all measurements. Monochromatic light
was supplied with a 300 W xenon lamp solar light simulator connected
to a monochromator (MSH300, LOT Quantum design). The intensity was
calibrated to 0.8 mW cm–2 for each individual wavelength,
and experiments with each electrode were conducted in triplicate with
different electrodes using an active area of 0.25 cm2.
Photocurrents were determined at each recorded wavelength through
light chopping using an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat. Error bars
represent standard deviation from the mean.
