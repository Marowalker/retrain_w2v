In this work, a theoretical
framework is developed to explain and
predict changes in the product distribution of the propene dimerization
reaction, which yields a mixture of C6 olefin isomers,
resulting from the use of different porous materials as catalysts.
The MOF-74 class of materials has shown promise in catalyzing the
dimerization of propene with high selectivity for valuable linear
olefin products. We show that experimentally observed changes in the
product distribution can be explained in terms of the contribution
of the pores to the free energy of formation, which are directly computed
using molecular simulation. Our model is used to screen a library
of 118 existing and hypothetical MOF and zeolite structures to study
how product distribution can be tuned by changing pore size, shape,
and composition of porous materials. Using these molecular descriptors,
catalyst properties are identified that increase the selective reaction
of linear olefin isomers, which are valued as industrial feedstocks.
A pore size commensurate with the size of the desired linear products
enhances linear conversion by sterically hindering the branched isomers.
Another promising feature is the presence of open metal sites, which
interact with the olefin π-bond to provide favorable binding
sites for the linear isomers.

1 Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline
materials comprising a three-dimensional (3D) network of metal centers
(nodes) connected by organic linkers. MOFs have generated a great
deal of interest as a promising class of materials for gas separation
and storage applications, because of their high surface area for gas
adsorption and the virtually limitless design space of nodes and linkers.1 The same characteristics make MOFs attractive
for catalysis as well, and recent years have seen the synthesis of
frameworks, which have high chemical and thermal stability and accessible
metal sites that can serve as active sites for catalysis.2−5

For example, the MOF-74 class of materials, which features
coordinatively
unsaturated metal sites, has shown promise in catalyzing the dimerization
of propene to C6 olefins with relatively high selectivity
and activity for valuable linear products: 1-hexene is a feedstock
for polyethylene, and its linear regioisomers are used to produce
lubricants and detergents.6 Supported nickel
catalysts are typically preferred for propene dimerization and other
olefin oligomerization reactions,6−8 but there is often a
tradeoff between catalytic activity and selectivity for the desired
products: Mlinar et al. showed, via tuning the free volume of a Ni-Na-X
zeolite, that the most constricted pores had the highest fraction
of linear isomer products, but the lowest catalytic activity. Correspondingly,
increasing the pore space led to higher activity but a loss of selectivity
toward linear isomers.9 Subsequent work
has shown that Ni2(dobdc) (Ni-MOF-74) and its expanded-linker
analogue, Ni2(dobpdc) (Ni-MOF-274), can achieve high linear
selectivity while maintaining high catalytic activity.10 By analyzing the product distribution of propene
oligomerization in the MOFs, Ni-Na-X, and Ni-loaded MCM-31, Mlinar
et al. showed that both MOF-74 materials had ∼10% less dimer
branching than the zeolite and mesoporous materials. The lower dimer
branching and corresponding higher linear selectivity in MOFs was
hypothesized to be due to increased steric hindrance around the Ni2+ active sites in the MOFs, which favors the transition state
for the linear dimer.10

The phenomena
governing reaction product distributions encompass
a wide range of time and length scales, from the localized and short-lived
transition state, to adsorption inside an individual pore and product
diffusion out of the porous material. An important difference of reactions
in nanopores is that, unlike reactions in liquid or gas phase, the
thermodynamics of the reaction is not known. In particular, there
is a lack of information on the contribution of the MOF or zeolite
to the free energy of formation. Molecular simulations can compensate
for this missing information and can help to, for example, quantify
the extent to which the pores favor or disfavor the products that
can form. Insights gained from molecular simulations can also provide
an atomistic perspective on features such as pore shape and composition
in order to better understand how these descriptors influence product
distribution and possibly even predict higher-performing candidate
materials for propene dimerization and other oligomerization reactions.11,12

Expanding on the foundational ideas of shape selectivity,
in this
work, we show how the product distribution can be tuned as a function
of pore size, shape, and composition. We used molecular simulations
to compute the contribution of different porous materials to the free
energy of formation of the C6 olefin isomers. We consider
the MOF Ni-MOF-74 and the zeolite Ni-Na-X in the Mlinar study,10 as well as synthesized and hypothetical zeolites
and hypothetical MOF-74 analogues, for a total of 118 materials. Where
experimental results are available, we show that our computational
predictions for linear selectivity agree well with the experiment.
One of the questions we sought to address, for example, is how the
linker structure in Ni-MOF-74 influences the free energy of formation,
prompting us to study the MOF-74 analogue materials generated by Witman
et al.13 Similar considerations motivated
our choice of additional existing and hypothetical zeolite materials.14,15 Of particular importance in this work is the presence of coordinatively
unsaturated metal sites in the MOF-74 analogues. These “open”
metal sites can engage in π complexation with the double bond
of the olefins, causing enrichment of olefin adsorption.16 We demonstrate that the presence of open metal
sites complements the shape-selective effects of pore geometry in
determining reaction product distribution.

2 Methods
2.1 Adsorbate and Adsorbent Models
To
compute the free energy of formation of the different isomers in each
porous material, we used models that describe the equilibrium interactions
between the adsorbates and the adsorbent materials. Parameters for
both bonded and van der Waals interactions for the dimer isomers were
taken from the TraPPE united atom force field, which has been demonstrated
to reproduce experimental hydrocarbon isotherms in porous materials
well.17

Nonbonded parameters for
Ni-MOF-74 and Ni-MOF-274 were taken from the Dreiding force field,18 with the exception of the metal atoms for which
parameters were taken from UFF.19−22 Charges for these MOFs were calculated using the
REPEAT method23 with electrostatic potentials
computed using density functional theory (DFT).24 MOF-74 analogue nonbonded parameters and charges were calculated
by Witman et al.13

Zeolite–adsorbate
interactions were described using modified
alkene–zeolite parameters in Liu et al.25 In order to capture the preferential interaction between
the MOF open metal sites and the olefin double bonds, the double bond
was described by a three-point charge model (qCHx = 0.85 e and qCOM = −1.70 e),26 which has been shown to reproduce the experimental
adsorption isotherm for ethene in the open-metal site MOF Cu3(BTC)2.27 For all other guest–adsorbate
interactions, Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rules were used to compute
Lennard-Jones interaction parameters.

2.2 Computing
Product Distribution
We
consider the product distribution to comprise the 12 experimentally
detected isomers shown in Table 1.10 Therefore, we do not
consider isomers that might have a very low free energy, but are not
formed in the experimental reaction pathway, or that do not diffuse
out of the material. We are interested in predicting the fraction
of linear isomers xl in
the product distribution arising from the different porous materials.
The first step in any study of product distribution is normally the
free energy of formation. Since this free energy is not known experimentally,
we use molecular simulations to gain insight into how the pores influence
the product distribution by considering the pore’s contribution
to the free energy of formation. Each product isomer, once formed,
must spend time adsorbed inside the material before diffusing out.
Therefore, the free energy of formation inside the pore can be expressed
for product isomer i as 1  Note that, for all product isomers, ΔGads,reac is the same, since it refers to adsorption
of two reactant propene molecules, so the dominant influence of the
pore on the product distribution is captured by the free energies
of adsorption of the product isomers, ΔGads,i.

Table 1 Propene Dimer Isomers
Considered in
This Work
At this point,
it is important to note that thermodynamics is not
the only factor that determines product distribution. Kinetics can
also play a role, but even in a kinetically controlled reaction, if
the transition state resembles the product state, then the contribution
of the pores to the free energy of formation can be of use, i.e.,
assuming that, for this system, the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi
relation holds.28 Without knowing the precise
mechanism of reaction, we can quantify the probability of formation
of a particular isomer i as 2  by assuming that the reaction is rate-limited,
which is likely given the small reactor size,10 and that the transition state resembles the product molecule.

The standard free energy of adsorption (ΔGads) was calculated as 3  where excess free energies of
the dimer isomers
at infinite dilution inside the frameworks were computed via Widom
insertions to get the Henry coefficient,29 4  where ⟨WIG⟩ is the ideal-gas Widom Rosenbluth weight, computed via a
separate simulation in an empty box. From the Henry coefficient, the
excess chemical potential (μex) was calculated using 5  

For
a single molecule at infinite dilution, μex = Gex. μexgas = Gexgas was also computed via Widom
insertions in the gas phase.

Internal energies of adsorption
were computed by using the Boltzmann-weighted
average energy from Widom insertion, ⟨U⟩W, and then subtracting the ideal gas intramolecular energy
calculated from NVT simulation to obtain 6  From
these values, the enthalpy and entropy
of adsorption could be calculated using relations from classical thermodynamics: 7  and 8  where eq 7 applies for adsorption at zero coverage.30,31

Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations29 were conducted with the RASPA molecular simulation
package.32 Simulations were conducted at
450 K, the operating temperature of the propene dimerization reaction.
At least 1 000 000 Monte Carlo (MC) cycles were used
to ensure convergence of the Henry coefficients. Adsorption sites
were visualized using the VisIt package.33

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structure
Database
Since our simulations
are at equilibrium conditions, we chose chemical structures that would
be representative of the equilibrium environment felt by the product
olefin isomers. The 118 total porous materials considered in this
study are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 1.14,15,34,35 Zeolite structures are represented in our simulations
without Ni sites, as the loading of Ni in Ni-Na-X is <0.6 wt %,
compared with 37.7 wt % in Ni-MOF-74.10 In addition, with the exception of Ni-MOF-74, MOFs containing Mg
rather than Ni as the metal site are used, since structures and parameters
have been generated for a large set of Mg-based MOF-74 isostructural
analogues,13 and we find that changing
the metal has little effect on the equilibrium properties of the material
(Figure 2).

3.2 Free-Energy
Profiles
The striking
observation that motivated this work is the enhanced linear conversion
of Ni-MOF-74 and Ni-MOF-274, compared to Ni-Na-X in the work of Mlinar
et al.10 They showed via fixed-bed reactor
experiments that Ni-MOF-74 and Ni-MOF-274 had a lower degree of dimer
branching than the zeolite Ni-Na-X, while Ni-MOF-74 and Ni-MOF-274
had a similar degree of dimer branching of ∼38%.10 In a homogeneous reaction, one would begin a
study of the product distribution by comparing the free energies of
formation of the products. For a reaction in a porous material, however,
this thermodynamic information is not known. The product distribution
may be influenced by many mechanisms, including thermodynamics, kinetics,
and diffusive processes. However, if the enhancement of linear conversion
in the MOFs is governed by the free energy of formation, then we should
be able to see a more favorable free energy of linear isomers in the
MOFs reflected in our calculations.

The ΔGads computed for the five linear and seven branched olefin
isomers (Table 1) are
shown in Figure 2 for
Ni-MOF-74, Mg-MOF-74, Mg-MOF-274, and FAU zeolite, relative to the
ΔGads of 1-hexene. This “free-energy
profile” represents the degree to which the porous material
stabilizes the formation of each isomer. An important result is that
this figure shows the free-energy profiles are qualitatively different
between the three MOF structures and FAU zeolite. In the MOFs, the
linear isomers are, on the whole, more stabilized than the branched
isomers, with the exception of cis-3-hexene in Mg-MOF-274. The free-energy
profile of the MOFs is virtually the inverse of that of FAU, where,
with the exception of trans-2-hexene and trans-3-hexene, the linear
isomers have much higher ΔGads values
than the branched isomers. The free-energy profiles MOFs in Figure 2 look similar to
each other; indeed, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the
Ni-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74 (Mg-MOF-274) is only 0.12 (0.28) kJ/mol, compared
to 2.22 kJ/mol between Ni-MOF-74 and FAU, indicating that the identity
of the metal does not influence the equilibrium free energy of the
isomers. Overall, these findings are consistent with the results of
the experimental study of Mlinar et al.,10 giving us confidence that our approach is reasonable and can be
applied to other materials that may be promising for this reaction.

The source of the contrast in free-energy landscapes of the metal–organic
and zeolitic materials is primarily in differences in the enthalpy
of adsorption. Figure 3 shows ΔHads and ΔSads of FAU and Ni-MOF-74. The enthalpy profile
of FAU looks qualitatively similar to its free-energy profile; branched
products have, on average, more favorable enthalpies of adsorption,
compared to linear products. The same qualitative agreement holds
for Ni-MOF-74. However, for the entropic contribution, the qualitative
trends are different. Adsorption of branched products is more entropically
favored in Ni-MOF-74 and FAU does not display a clear entropic preference
toward the adsorption of either group. The trends in entropy of adsorption
can be attributed to the larger configurational space of the linear
molecules in the gas phase, which means that, once adsorbed, they
lose more entropy than their branched, more rigid, counterparts. Enthalpically,
the flexibility of the linear isomers allows them to adopt an energetically
favorable configuration with the π-bond closer to the open metal
sites in the MOF, whereas FAU has no such favorable adsorption sites,
so the linear isomers lose more entropy, relative to the branched
isomers upon adsorption in the MOFs compared to that observed in the
zeolites.

3.3 Linear Conversion
We wish to identify
materials that can selectively convert propene to linear C6 olefins. We quantify this selectivity by calculating the total fraction
of linear isomers in the product mixture predicted by molecular simulation.
Making use of eq 2 for
the probability of formation of a particular isomer pi, and defining the linear conversion
as xL = ∑linearpi, we find that 9  

Linear conversion xL calculated in this manner
for Ni-MOF-74,
Mg-MOF-74, Mg-MOF-274, and FAU is shown in Figure 4, together with the equivalent experimental
values from Mlinar et al.10 The computed
linear conversions for the MOF materials are close in value, while
the linear conversion of FAU is ∼10.0% lower. This agrees with
the observation from the previously calculated free-energy profiles
that the MOFs favor adsorption of linear isomers to a larger degree
than branched isomers.

Figure 4 Fraction of linear dimer isomers in product distribution,
experimental
and simulated. Experimental values are taken from the work of Mlinar
et al.10

The 10.0% enhancement in linear conversion of Ni-MOF-74,
relative
to FAU, is in good agreement with the 11.1% enhancement observed experimentally
by Mlinar et al.,10 suggesting that our
model and theoretical framework capture quantitatively the influence
of the adsorbent material on product distribution. Interestingly,
the absolute predicted linear conversions are 13.0% lower than their
respective experimental values. This means the experimental materials
are consistently more selective toward linear isomers than their simulated
counterparts. This could be due to diffusive barriers that are not
taken into account by our simulations, which would favor the less-bulky
linear isomers. We also want to emphasize that these calculations
rely on equilibrium thermodynamics, and thus presume that Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi
conditions are met. This is often, but not always, true when the product
and transition states are similarly affected by steric hindrance;
however, a rigorous validation of BEP relation applicability would
require quantum mechanical study of each material.12 In the propene dimerization reaction, experimental results
suggest that increased linear selectivity is linked to increased steric
constraints within a material, which disfavors dimer branching.9 Since we observe that the steric penalty imposed
on the product molecules is the dominant factor leading to trends
in linear selectivity that agree with the experiment, we infer that
it is reasonable to apply BEP assumptions to propene dimerization
within the materials studied.

From this comparison with the
experimental results of Mlinar et
al.,10 we can conclude that the contribution
of the pores to the free energy of formation is indeed a useful indicator
of how the product distribution varies with the catalyst material.
Therefore, it is interesting to explore how this distribution can
be further changed by using a different zeolite or MOF structure.
Expanding the database of structures allows us to better understand
how molecular descriptors correlate with product distribution, and
further elucidate design principles of materials for propene dimerization.

3.4 Extension to Other Frameworks and Understanding
Factors Influencing Linear Selectivity
A wide variety of
pore geometries exists among crystalline, microporous materials. Differences
in local structure around a particular adsorption site, as well as
the global topology of the material, influence the relative adsorption
free energies within a set of adsorbate molecules. Most of the frameworks
in this study have one-dimensional channel topologies so that we could
use the channel diameter as a quantitative metric for comparison between
materials, and compare these materials to the MOF-74 class of materials,
which have high experimentally observed linear selectivity.

The linear conversions computed for these materials in this study
are shown in Figure 5, plotted against the largest free sphere diameter (dfree). The zeolite materials, both hypothetical and synthesized,
show sensitivity to dfree below 10 Å,
and above this threshold diameter, the linear conversion remains virtually
constant. Below dfree = 10 Å, the
linear conversion varies nonmonotonically with pore size. At intermediate
diameters, the materials favor branched dimer isomers, and there is
a local minimum in linear conversion at ∼7.5 Å. From 7.5
Å to 5 Å, the linear conversion increases, reaching almost
80%. Below 5 Å, there is no clear correlation between linear
conversion and pore size; instead, there is a wide spread in predicted
product distributions, likely because these small pore diameters approach
the average size of a C6 olefin isomer and small changes
in local pore geometry can cause some C6 olefin isomers
to be extremely disfavored.

Figure 5 Fraction of linear dimer isomers in product
distribution (linear
conversion) versus largest free sphere diameter for zeolites and MOFs.

There are a few zeolites that
achieve close to full linear conversion
(APD, 99%, and ATO, 96%) and zero linear conversion (EDI, 2.5%, and
h8186492, 4.8%). Their structures shown in Figure 6. The pores of APD and ATO zeolites provide
particularly favorable adsorption sites for 1-hexene, cis-2-hexene,
and cis-3-hexene, which are able to coil into the small channels without
incurring too much steric penalty, in order to take advantage of the
enthalpic reward of binding in a tight pocket. In APD (ATO), the ΔHads value of these three linear isomers is,
on average, 19 kJ/mol (5.5 kJ/mol) more favorable than the next-closest
isomer’s ΔHads value.

Figure 6 Zeolites achieving
close to 100% and 0% linear conversion.

For EDI and h8186492 zeolites, the product distributions
are heavily
dominated by a single-branched isomer: 2,3-methyl-1-butene in EDI
and cis-4-methyl-2-pentene in h8186492, which respectively account
for 87% and 88% of the total product distribution. These branched
isomers are inherently more configurationally constrained, so we attribute
their comparatively low ΔHads to
a fortuitous binding pocket that complements the isomer structure.
These examples demonstrate that frameworks whose pore sizes approach
the size of the product molecules can be highly selective toward a
particular product or group of products, with very different selectivities
even among structures with comparable geometric descriptors.

Like the zeolites, Ni-MOF-74 and its isostructural analogues also
have approximately constant linear conversion above 10 Å. Surprisingly,
however, the linear conversion is shifted 10%–13% higher than
that of the zeolites, resulting in all of the MOFs with dfree > 10 Å having significantly enhanced linear
conversion, compared to the zeolites within the same range. Eleven
of the MOF-74 analogues have equal or higher linear conversion than
Mg-MOF-274, which is the highest-performing previously synthesized
MOF, with the best analogue having a predicted 1.5% increase in linear
conversion over Mg-MOF-274 (see Figure 7). Since there is only one published MOF-74 analogue
structure smaller than 10 Å (Mg2(DHFUMA)),36 it is not possible to determine the composition-independent
effect of pore diameter below 10 Å. However, the linear conversion
of Mg2(DHFUMA) falls within the range of the linear conversion
among zeolites of the same pore size, suggesting that, for small pore
sizes, the physical amount of pore space available to adsorbates dominates
their relative free energies of adsorption.

Figure 7 MOF-74 analogue (structure
name: 184 × 1_all_conf_10850_1,13dfree = 21.0 Å)
with 1.5% higher linear conversion than Mg-MOF-274, which is the best-performing
previously synthesized MOF.

Since the linear conversion is a function of the relative
free
energies of adsorption of linear and branched isomers, further insights
can be gleaned by examining the enthalpic and entropic contributions
to these free energies in Figure 8. Both ΔHads and
ΔSads for each isomer are dependent
very strongly on pore size, with a range of ΔHads and ΔSads values
for different isomers inside the same material. ΔHads is very repulsive for small pore sizes, reaches a
minimum at dfree ≈ 5 Å, the
median end-to-end distance of the product isomers, and levels off
for larger pore sizes. ΔSads is
more monotonic, decreasing sharply for decreasing dfree < 7.5 Å, and then remaining relatively constant
for larger pore sizes.

Figure 8 ΔHads and ΔSads of all components (upper); ΔΔHads and ΔΔSads (lower). ΔΔMads ≡
⟨ΔMads⟩linear – ⟨ΔMads⟩branched for M = {S, H}. In the upper two plots, the indicated property is plotted
for all 12 product isomers for each of the frameworks considered,
with insets for clarity, whereas, in the lower two plots, there is
one point per material describing the extent to which each material
favors the linear product isomers.

While all of the materials appear to have the same average
dependence
of ΔHads and ΔSads on pore size, the difference between the highest and
lowest ΔHads and ΔSads within a single material appears to be slightly
larger for the MOFs than for the zeolites, indicating that the MOFs
differentiate more between the product isomers than do the zeolites.
To investigate this spread, we define the properties ΔΔHads and ΔΔSads, where ΔΔMads ≡
⟨ΔMads⟩linear – ⟨ΔMads⟩branched for M = {S, H}. More negative ΔΔHads values indicate an enthalpic preference for linear isomers to adsorb
in MOFs than in zeolites, while the entropic preference is greater
for more positive ΔΔSads.
In Figure 8, ΔΔHads shows large variations for small pore sizes,
indicating that the relative binding energies of linear and branched
isomers is very sensitive to pore shape for small pores. For larger
pore sizes of dfree > 10 Å, the
ΔΔHads of the MOFs and MOF-74
analogues are consistently
3–5 kJ/mol lower than that of zeolite materials, indicating
that MOFs enthalpically favor linear isomers. By contrast, from the
analogous ΔΔSads plot, the
MOFs appear to entropically favor the branched isomers. Overall, the
ΔΔHads value exerts the dominant
influence on linear conversion (Figure 9), and the enhanced linear conversion of MOFs can be
attributed to enthalpic effects that selectively favor the adsorption
of linear isomers.

Figure 9 Linear conversion of all frameworks vs Δ(ΔHads) (left) and Δ(ΔSads) (right). The correlation between linear conversion
and
ΔΔHads of the porous materials
indicates that the enthalpy of adsorption is the dominant contributor
to differences in linear conversion between materials. By contrast,
there is little correlation between linear conversion and ΔΔSads.

This suggests that specific chemical interactions can enhance
the
influence of pore shape on product distribution, adding a layer of
complexity to traditional shape selectivity theory, which uses purely
geometric considerations to explain differences in product distributions
between chemically similar zeolites.11 The
strong π-orbital interactions between the double bonds of the
olefin isomers and the open metal site in the MOF-74 series enthalpically
favors the linear isomers, for which the double bond is more accessible.
For the same reason, since linear product isomers have a stronger
tendency to adsorb with their π-bonds facing the open metal
site, they lose more configurational entropy upon adsorption, compared
to branched isomers.

The effect of these π-orbital interactions
can be seen in
the comparison of the binding sites of the double bond in metal–organic
and zeolite frameworks (Figure 10). In the Ni-MOF-74, the 1-hexene double bond has a
tendency to adsorb closer to open metal sites than the less-accessible
double bond in cis-2-hexene, which, in turn, is still more localized
near the metal sites than cis-3-methyl-2-pentene. In these sites,
1-hexene, cis-2-hexene, and cis-3-methyl-2-pentene have ΔHads values of −38.8, – 38.7, and
−36.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The same pattern of adsorption
site localization, coupled with more favorable ΔHads for the linear isomers, is visible in Mg-MOF-74 and
Mg-MOF-274 (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 10 Probability density plots of C6 olefin isomer adsorption
sites inside FAU zeolite and Ni-MOF-74. The probability densities
correspond to the indicated points marking the geometric center of
the π-bond on the three product isomers shown at the top.

In FAU, since there are no specific
framework−π-bond
interactions, there is little difference between the adsorption sites
of the three isomers. 1-Hexene, cis-2-hexene, and cis-3-methyl-2-pentene
have ΔHads values of −28.8,
−30.6, and −30.8 kJ/mol, respectively, opposite to the
order of adsorption strength in Ni-MOF-74. As a result, the zeolite
disfavors the linear isomers, compared to the MOF. Probability density
plots for other frameworks are provided in the Supporting Information. In some of the probability density
plots for other zeolites, there is a more pronounced difference between
adsorption sites of the branched and linear isomers than in FAU. There
are regions with a higher probability of 1-hexene adsorption in AET
and hypothetical zeolite h8160847, for example, which are closer to
the pore walls and extend into more-constrained pockets in the frameworks.
However, they do not coincide with a more favorable ΔHads for linear molecules, compared to the branched
ones, as is the case in Ni-MOF-74.

From these observations,
we can infer a few design rules to guide
the synthesis of new materials for propene dimerization and other
olefin oligomerization reactions. To increase the linear conversion
of a zeolite material, a smaller framework size of 5–7 Å
can be used. Alternatively, one can also tune the pore chemistry by
taking advantage of the large chemical design space of MOFs. A significant
enhancement in linear conversion can be achieved by introducing a
high density of open metal sites to preferentially bind the double
bond of the olefins. Ni3(BTC)2 also has open
metal sites37 and could be used as a candidate
for this reaction and a template upon which to base analogous structures.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown
that the product distribution of the
propene dimerization reaction in different porous materials can be
modeled computationally using equilibrium simulations and a three-point
charge description of the π-bond of the olefin double bond.
From the free-energy profiles computed for the different materials,
we predicted a trend of increased linear conversion in open metal
site MOFs, compared to zeolites, which is in good agreement with the
linear conversion observed in the experiments. This suggests that
the product distribution of the olefin dimerization is largely influenced
by the contribution of the pores to the free energy of the product
isomers.

We extended our study to other zeolitic and metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), both synthesized and hypothetical, in order to
better understand the material properties that influence dimerization
product distribution. We found that, for frameworks with a pore diameter
under 10 Å, selectivity toward linear isomers is a sensitive
function of pore size, with very high linear conversion at ∼5
Å. In this regime, the effect of pore size on the product distribution
can be attributed to changes in the enthalpy of adsorption. It is
important to note that, in industrial applications, a framework with
such a small pore size might be disadvantageous, because of the diffusive
barriers that would result.

Above a pore diameter of 10 Å,
the linear conversion for the
zeolite materials plateaus at ∼40%, while the linear conversion
for the MOFs increases and remains steady at ∼50%, with a few
frameworks even predicted to have higher linear selectivity than the
experimentally high-performing Ni-MOF-74. This striking enhancement
in linear conversion for MOFs is due to the preferential adsorption
of π-bonds at open metal sites.

These results elucidate
some of the mechanisms governing product
distribution in the propene dimerization reaction, and suggest promising
not-yet-synthesized frameworks that could deliver higher linear conversion
than the existing catalysts. Further work is needed to investigate
the product distribution over different classes of open metal sites
(for example, copper paddlewheel-type structures) to determine whether
the linear enhancement effect is specific to the open metal site motif
in the MOF-74 family. In addition, in this study, we only took into
account thermodynamic considerations in predicting the linear conversion
in different materials. For practical applications, there are many
other factors, such as framework stability and diffusion limitations,
which we did not address. Additional theoretical and experimental
studies could clarify the influence of these phenomena on the product
distribution.
