Colloidal synthesis
of nanocrystals (NC) followed by their attachment
to a support and activation is a promising route to prepare model
catalysts for research on structure-performance relationships. Here,
we investigated the suitability of this method to prepare well-defined
Co/TiO2 and Co/SiO2 catalysts for the Fischer–Tropsch
(FT) synthesis with high control over the cobalt particle size. To
this end, Co-NC of 3, 6, 9, and 12 nm with narrow size distributions
were synthesized and attached uniformly on either TiO2 or
SiO2 supports with comparable morphology and Co loadings
of 2–10 wt %. After activation in H2, the FT activity
of the TiO2-supported 6 and 12 nm Co-NC was similar to
that of a Co/TiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation, showing
that full activation was achieved and relevant catalysts had been
obtained; however, 3 nm Co-NC on TiO2 were less active
than anticipated. Analysis after FT revealed that all Co-NC on TiO2 as well as 3 nm Co-NC on SiO2 had grown to ∼13
nm, while the sizes of the 6 and 9 nm Co-NC on SiO2 had remained stable. It was found that the 3 nm Co-NC on TiO2 already grew to 10 nm during activation in H2.
Furthermore, substantial amounts of Co (up to 60%) migrated from the
Co-NC to the support during activation on TiO2 against
only 15% on SiO2. We showed that the stronger interaction
between cobalt and TiO2 leads to enhanced catalyst restructuring
as compared to SiO2. These findings demonstrate the potential
of the NC-based method to produce relevant model catalysts to investigate
phenomena that could not be studied using conventionally synthesized
catalysts.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles
on a support material are widely applied as
heterogeneous catalysts in industrial processes.1−4 In order to improve industrial
catalyst design, it is a prerequisite to link their structure to their
performance which requires well-defined model catalysts.5,6 Several nanotechnological techniques have recently been developed
that allow the synthesis of catalysts with high control over parameters
such as composition, size, or shape of metal nanoparticles.5,7

Among the available techniques, the colloidal synthesis of
nanocrystals
(NC) is especially promising for the preparation of catalysts. By
preforming the NC in solution instead of directly on the support as
is custom in conventional synthesis techniques, it is possible to
synthesize monodisperse, single crystalline, and size-controlled NC.8 The vast majority of the research so far focused
on noble metal NC even though base metals are very important for catalysis.
However, base metal NC are more challenging to utilize in supported
catalysts. First, homogeneous attachment of base metal NC on a support
can be hindered by magnetic interactions between the NC.9 Second, removal of the stabilizing ligand shell
can be incomplete, blocking active sites and lowering catalytic activity,
or harsh treatments are applied that may compromise the well-defined
nature of the catalyst.10,11 Recently we demonstrated
uniform attachment and successful ligand removal for Co-NC supported
on carbon nanotubes by applying a mild, low-temperature oxidation
to the NC in suspension prior to attachment.12

A particular application where NC-based catalysts can contribute
to fundamental understanding is the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis,
i.e. the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (an H2/CO
mixture) into hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals.13 The cobalt-catalyzed FT reaction is reported to be structure
sensitive, related to both cobalt particle size14,15 and cobalt crystal structure.16−18 So far, most research involving
Co-NC for FT concentrated either on slurry-phase FT, in which the
unsupported Co-NC remain in suspension,19−21 or on Co-NC supported
on irreducible oxides (mainly SiO2 or Al2O3).22−29 However, reducible oxides such as TiO2 are also interesting
supports for cobalt-based FT catalysts, for both industry30 and academia.31

TiO2-supported cobalt catalysts can be considered more
complex than Co/SiO2 or Co/Al2O3,
since TiO2 can be partially reduced under reaction conditions,
leading to special interphase phenomena known as strong metal–support
interactions (SMSI).32,33 The effects of these metal-TiO2 interactions remain poorly understood, in part because synthesis
procedures for well-defined catalysts are lacking, especially for
<10 nm Co particles. TiO2-supported catalysts with narrow
Co particle size distributions can be synthesized using conventional
methods, but the control over the average particle size is limited.34,35 Furthermore, there are only a few reports of NC-based Co/TiO2 catalysts, and these either contained boron impurities owing
to the synthesis method36,37 or the Co-NC were 10
nm or larger.24,38 Therefore, it would be highly
desirable to expand the applicability of Co-NC to TiO2 as
support.

Here we report the synthesis and catalytic performance
of well-defined
catalysts containing 3–12 nm Co-NC on TiO2 and SiO2 and demonstrate their use as model systems by studying particle
growth under FT conditions. The Co-NC were synthesized by a hot-injection
method. After low-temperature oxidation, the CoO-NC were homogeneously
attached to either TiO2 or SiO2. Their catalytic
performance was comparable to that of Co/TiO2 prepared
by impregnation, except for 3 nm Co-NC on TiO2, whose activity
was substantially lower. The TiO2-supported Co particles
and 3 nm Co-NC on SiO2 sintered during reduction and/or
FT, indicating that both the support and initial NC size affected
the stability of Co-NC under reaction conditions. We show that the
followed NC-based methodology enabled the synthesis of size-controlled
Co/TiO2 and Co/SiO2 with relevant catalytic
performance. Their potential as model systems is underlined by investigating
NC particle growth, revealing phenomena that are not observed with
conventionally prepared catalysts.

Experimental Methods
Cobalt
Nanocrystal Synthesis
Cobalt nanocrystals of
different sizes were synthesized by a hot injection method based on
the literature39 and our previous work.12 A schematic summary of the NC synthesis procedure
is shown in Figure S1. The benefit of this
method is that the required chemicals contain no elements such as
phosphorus or boron that might affect the catalyst and its final catalytic
performance. The syntheses were performed on a Schlenk line in N2 atmosphere. In a typical synthesis, 65 mg of oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,
90%, technical grade) was degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for
30 min in a 3-necked 100 mL flask with a cooler and two septa. After
flushing and switching to N2, 7.5 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene
was added under inert atmosphere, and the solution was heated to temperatures
between 165 and 182 °C related to the desired NC size. Simultaneously,
inside a glovebox, 270 mg of dicobalt octacarbonyl (Acros Organics,
95%, stabilized) was dissolved in 1.5 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenze. This
cobalt precursor was then rapidly injected (needle: Ø0.9 ×
70 mm) into the heated solution under 750 rpm magnetic stirring and
decomposed instantly. The reaction was quenched after 20 min using
a water bath. Once at ambient temperature, the N2 supply
was switched off, and one septum was removed to allow low-temperature
oxidation by air-exposure under 650 rpm stirring. After 1 h, the mixture
was divided over two glass centrifuge tubes, filled to 20 mL with
2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich, >99%, LC-MS Chromasolv), and centrifuged
at 2200 G for 30 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the residue
was redispersed in 0.5 mL of n-hexane (Acros Organics,
99+ %) per tube by sonication. The tubes were filled to 20 mL with
2-propanol and centrifuged at 2200 G for 40 min. This washing cycle
was repeated twice, and after the last step, the residue was redispersed
and combined in a total of 2 mL of n-hexane.

Cobalt
Nanocrystal Attachment
The Co-NC were attached
to a support according to the method developed by Casavola et al.40 A schematic summary of the NC attachment procedure
is shown in Figure S1. The supports were
TiO2 (Evonik, Aeroxide P25) or SiO2 (Evonik,
Aerosil OX 50), both sieved to a fraction of 75–150 μm.
To regulate the final cobalt loading, between 0.4 and 2.5 g of support
was suspended in a mixture of the colloidal suspension and 5–31
mL of 1-octadecene (Sigma-Aldrich, 90%, technical grade) inside a
100 mL 3-necked flask. A cooler, glass plug, and septum were connected
to the flask, the magnetic stirring was set to 400 rpm, and the suspension
was degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for 15 min, during which
the n-hexane from the colloidal suspension evaporated.
The setup was then flushed, switched to N2, and heated
to 200 °C. The heating was stopped after 30 min at 200 °C,
and the solution was cooled to ambient temperature in approximately
30 min. The suspension was divided over two glass centrifuge tubes
and centrifuged at 1500 G for 5 min, and the supernatant was decanted.
The residue was resuspended in 2 mL of n-hexane,
sonicated for 1 min, diluted with 6 mL of acetone, and centrifuged
at 1500 G for 5 min, and the supernatant was again decanted. This
washing cycle was repeated five times, followed by resuspending the
residue in 20 mL of acetone, sonicating for 1 min, centrifuging at
1500 G for 5 min, and decanting the supernatant. Afterward, the samples
were dried at 60 °C for 1 h in static air, followed by 120 °C
for 3 h in static air and 80 °C for 3 h under vacuum. Finally,
the samples were sieved to a grain size of 75–150 μm.

Incipient Wetness Impregnation
A comparison Co/TiO2 sample was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation following
the procedure by Eschemann et al.34 First,
2 g of TiO2 (Evonik, Aeroxide P25) was sieved to 75–150
μm and then dried at 80 °C for 1 h under vacuum. The vacuum
was released and the TiO2 was impregnated directly
afterward with a pore-filling amount of precursor solution consisting
of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Acros Organics,
99+ %) in Milli-Q water. The solution was added dropwise under magnetic
and manual stirring. After the addition, the powder was dried and
heat treated in a U-shaped, glass reactor in fluidized bed mode (1
L·min–1 upward flow of N2). Drying
took place at 80 °C for 2 h and was followed directly by a thermal
treatment at 250 °C for 2 h, both with 2 °C·min–1. The sample was finally sieved again to a grain size
of 75–150 μm.

Plasma Cleaning
Optionally, pristine
Co-NC samples
were plasma cleaned to remove the ligands prior to reduction and FT.
Typically, 100 mg of sample was treated for 8 h in a homemade container
inserted into a Fischione Model 1020 Plasma Cleaner. The plasma was
generated using a 25% O2 in Ar flow and a 13.56 MHz oscillating
electromagnetic field.

Characterization
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM)
was performed either on a Tecnai 12 (FEI), operated at 120 kV, or
on a Tecnai 20 (FEI), operated at 200 kV. TEM samples of Co-NC suspensions
were prepared by sonicating and dropcasting a diluted sample directly
on a carbon-coated TEM grid. To prepare a sample of supported Co-NC,
the solid was first suspended in 2-propanol by sonication and then
dropcasted on a TEM grid. In the case of samples after catalysis,
the samples were washed three times using toluene and 30 min sonication
and once using n-hexane to remove the hydrocarbon
reaction products before dropcasting on a TEM grid. The sizes of >200
Co particles were determined manually using ImageJ software.
All particle sizes are reported as the Sauter mean diameter (volume/surface
mean, D[3,2]) of the equivalent metallic cobalt particles, meaning
that the measured diameters of (partial) cobalt oxide particles
were corrected based on the densities of the oxide and the metal.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) was performed in high-angle annular
dark-field (HAADF) mode on a Talos F200X (FEI), equipped with a high-brightness
field emission gun (X-FEG) and a Super-X G2 EDX detector and operated
at 200 kV. Particle size analysis was similar to that of TEM, with
the exception that <200 particles were analyzed for some samples,
depending on the particle size and cobalt loading.

HAADF-STEM-EDX
of the same positions of 12 nm Co-NC on TiO2 before and
after reduction was performed using a SiN TEM
chip (TEMWindow SN100-A50Q33). After imaging the pristine sample,
the SiN TEM chip was transferred to a glass U-shaped reactor, and
the sample on the chip was reduced ex situ in 25%
H2 in Ar flow at 350 °C for 8 h with 1 °C·min–1 and cooled down afterward under the same atmosphere.
Subsequently, the chip was transferred back to the microscope and
analyzed again. During the transfer, the sample was exposed to air
at ambient conditions.

N2-physisorption of the bare
supports was measured at
−196 °C on a Tristar 3000 (Micromeritics). The samples
were dried in N2 at 300 °C for 14–20 h prior
to the analysis.

Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
was carried out on a SPECTRO ARCOS, and the sample was digested in
aqua regia to extract the cobalt.

Temperature programed reduction
(TPR) profiles were measured on
an Autochem 2920 (Micromeritics). Approximately 100 mg of sample was
reduced in 5% H2 in Ar flow from 50 to 800 °C with
5 °C·min–1.

X-ray diffraction (XRD)
was performed on a Bruker D2 Phaser, equipped
with a Co radiation source (λ = 1.789 Å). The sample was
measured between 20 and 100° 2θ with an increment of 0.05°.

Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis
The catalytic performance
in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis was investigated using an
Avantium Flowrence 16 parallel reactor setup. Stainless steel plug
flow reactors of 2.0 or 2.6 mm ID were loaded with 25–110 mg
of catalyst (75–150 μm) diluted with 100 mg of SiC (200–425
μm). Prior to reaction, the catalysts were reduced in
situ at 1 bar in 25% H2 in He flow at either 350
°C (TiO2-samples) or 500 °C (SiO2-samples)
for 8 h with 1 °C·min–1. Afterward, the
reactors were cooled to 180 °C and pressurized to 20 bar. At
these conditions, the atmosphere was switched to synthesis gas with
H2/CO = 2 (v/v) and 5% He as internal standard. Subsequently,
the reactors were heated to 220 °C with 1 °C·min–1, and product analysis was started after 1 h. The
reaction products were analyzed online using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped
with two channels. The first channel contained an Agilent J&W
PoraBOND Q column connected to an FID to detect the hydrocarbon products,
and the second one consisted of a ShinCarbon-ST column connected to
a TCD to analyze the permanent gases.

The catalytic activity
was reported as CO conversion (XCO), cobalt
time yield (CTY), and turnover frequency (TOF). The TOF was based
on the activity and the Sauter mean diameter (D[3,2]) of the spent
Co-NC after correction for a 3 nm CoO passivation layer, assuming
a cross-sectional area of 0.0662 nm2 per cobalt atom.41 The selectivity (%C) to C1–C4 products was defined as SC1–C4 = 100 %·FCn·n·(FCO,in·XCO)−1 with n being the product’s carbon number and F being the flow of the corresponding hydrocarbon or CO. The selectivity
to C5+ was defined as SC5+ =
100 % – SC1–C4.

Results
and Discussion
Cobalt Nanocrystal Synthesis
Well-defined
cobalt nanocrystals
were synthesized with distinct sizes between 3 and 12 nm and a polydispersity
of 11–18% (Figure 1, additional particle size distributions in Figure S2). The Co-NC were designated as CoX, with X denoting
the average diameter of the NC. The size of the Co-NC size was regulated
by varying the temperature of the hot injection synthesis, which is
in line with the literature.39,42 The Co-NC size correlated
with the synthesis temperature in the range of 170–183 °C
and became less reproducible at lower temperature (Figure 1d). After the synthesis, low-temperature
oxidation by air-exposure at ambient conditions was applied to facilitate
attachment and activation of the Co-NC.12 The Co-NC  of 3, 6, 9, and 12 nm were attached to TiO2 or SiO2, thus omitting the Co-NC of 4 and 8 nm in Figure 1d.

Cobalt Nanocrystal Attachment
The Co-NC were attached
to titania and silica with comparable specific surface areas (∼50
m2·g–1) but different mesopore volumes
(0.3 and 0.1 mL·g–1, respectively) as determined
by N2-physisorption (Figure S3, Table S1). The cobalt loading was adjusted to obtain similar cobalt
metal surface areas per unit weight of catalyst in the pristine samples
with the aim to avoid major differences in catalyst-weight-based activities
during FT (Table 1).
Furthermore, the Co-NC on the supports were analyzed with TEM (Figure 2). The Co-NC distribution
was uniform over both supports, similar to previous results with a
carbon support.12,40 In addition, a reference Co/TiO2 sample was prepared by conventional techniques, in this case
incipient wetness impregnation of a cobalt nitrate solution (designated
as IWI-Co/TiO2, details in Table 1 and TEM results in Figure S4). Its average particle size was most comparable to Co6/TiO2, but the particle size distribution was substantially broader.

Sauter mean diameter (±

and recalculated to the corresponding Co0 particle sizes.
The Co loading was determined by ICP-OES. Based on these two results,
a Co specific surface area of the pristine catalysts was calculated.

insets are at double the magnification of the original image.

The sizes of the Co-NC remained
unchanged during the attachment
treatment as concluded from TEM (Figure 2). The Co-NC of 3 and 6 nm consisted completely
of CoO,12 while for the 9 and 12 nm Co-NC
only an outer layer of CoO was formed and a metallic core with higher
contrast was observed. This CoO shell had a thickness of 4.5 nm in
the case of Co12/TiO2, which exceeds the CoO passivation
layer of 3 nm that is typically observed upon exposure of metallic
cobalt particles to air at ambient conditions.43 The increased oxidation of the Co-NCs could have occurred
during drying at 120 °C, as this is close to the temperature
range where Kirkendall effects have been observed.44 The Kirkendall effect occurs upon oxidation of metals at
elevated temperatures and leads to the formation of hollow metal oxide
particles.11,45

The reducibility of the
Co-NC on TiO2 samples was investigated
by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR, Figure 3a). Two reduction peaks were observed between
250 and 450 °C for all samples next to a negative peak at higher
temperatures, which is attributed to the desorption/decomposition
of remaining ligands.12 As expected, the
reduction shifted to lower temperatures with increasing particle size,
because small oxide particles often display lower reducibility.46−48 Furthermore, the total H2-uptake related to the first
two peaks increased with the particle size following the increase
in cobalt content. When comparing the total H2-uptake
of the Co-NC/TiO2 samples normalized to the amount of Co,
the H2-uptake of Co12/TiO2 was only 89–92%
of that of the 3 and 6 nm NC (deconvolutions in Figure S5). This indicated that ∼10% of the cobalt
in Co12/TiO2 was still present in the core of the NC as
metallic cobalt, which was in line with the earlier TEM observation
of a metallic core and a CoO passivation layer (Figure 2).

(v/v), GHSV = 1950–5900 h–1, and XCO = 5–60%.

Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis
The cobalt-weight-based
activity (cobalt time yield, CTY) of the TiO2-supported
samples was evaluated over 100 h on stream (Figure 3b, Table 2). Co6/TiO2 was the most active after 100
h followed by Co12/TiO2, which was initially more active
but deactivated faster. Co3/TiO2 was a factor 5 less active
per unit weight of cobalt over the entire time range studied. Interestingly,
the 6 and 12 nm Co-NC catalysts were similar or even higher in CTY
than the IWI-Co/TiO2 catalyst, indicating that these Co-NC
were adequately activated and that relevant catalytic results were
obtained with these NC-based model systems. Furthermore, the selectivity
toward C5+ products was around 85% for all TiO2-supported samples, except for Co3/TiO2 whose C5+-selectivity was only 57% (Table 2).

b The reported data was obtained
after 90–100 h on stream. The TOF was based on the end-of-run
activity and Co particle size (D[3,2]) of the spent samples. The Sauter
mean diameter (± standard deviation) of the Co-NC was analyzed
in the spent and passivated state and corrected for the lattice expansion
due to the 3 nm CoO passivation layer.

The catalytic activity of the Co/SiO2 samples
was investigated
over 100 h on stream at CO conversion levels between 15 and 30% (Figure S6, Table 2). The cobalt-weight-based activities of Co6/SiO2 and Co9/SiO2 were the highest of all investigated
catalysts. The 3 nm Co-NC displayed again the lowest activity of the
series, yet Co3/SiO2 was a factor 6 more active per unit
weight of cobalt than Co3/TiO2. The C5+-selectivities
of the SiO2-supported catalysts varied between 76 and 79%
and were overall lower than that of most TiO2-supported
catalysts (∼85%). This observation corresponds well with earlier
findings of TiO2 promoting the C5+-selectivity
of cobalt catalysts in FT.49

The
deactivation and observed differences in activity could be
caused by several mechanisms, such as carbon deposition,50 metal–support compound formation,51 or net particle growth.51 To investigate the occurrence of particle growth in more detail,
the spent catalysts were analyzed with TEM (Table 2, Figure 4, Figure S7). All Co-NC
supported on TiO2, as well as the IWI-Co/TiO2, had grown to ∼13 nm on average, which was in line with recently
reported particle sizes of a Co–Re/TiO2 catalyst
after various periods on stream.51 On SiO2, the initially 3 nm Co-NC had also sintered to 13 nm, while
the 6 and 9 nm Co-NC were stable.

sizes on (c) TiO2 and on (d) SiO2 after different
treatments. In these illustrations, Co2+ or Co3+ is depicted in yellow, and Co0 is depicted in blue. Migration
of Co to TiO2 during reduction was observed by EDX.

Using the particle sizes of the
spent catalysts and the activities
at 90–100 h on stream, the surface-specific activities (turnover
frequencies, TOF) were calculated (Table 2). The TOF of all TiO2-supported
catalysts except Co3/TiO2 was around 65 × 10–3 s–1, in line with previous reports.52−54 The identical TOF of 6 and 12 nm Co-NC on TiO2 and the
IWI-Co/TiO2 catalyst showed that the active cobalt sites
were not affected by the presence of residual ligands or other factors
specific to the NC-based synthesis method. The apparent TOF of Co3/TiO2, based on the particle size of the catalyst and the end-of-run
activity, was only 12 × 10–3 s–1 (Table 2). This was
remarkable, because the Co particles in Co3/TiO2 had grown
outside of the size regime where particle size effects typically cause
low activities (<6–8 nm).14,15,22 Therefore, a TOF similar to the others (65 ×
10–3 s–1) should have been obtained.
Instead, the low apparent TOF was ascribed to loss of cobalt from
the metal particles to the TiO2 resulting in less metallic
surface area available for catalysis. Judging from the decrease in
TOF, up to 80% of the cobalt was lost in this manner.

The TOF
of the SiO2-supported catalysts increased with
initial particle size (Table 2). In the case of the initially 3 nm Co-NC on SiO2, the TOF was 67 × 10–3 s–1, which was similar to most Co/TiO2 catalysts and already
somewhat higher than previously reported for Co/SiO2 catalysts.55 However, the intrinsic activities of 6 and 9
nm Co-NC on SiO2 were exceptionally high in comparison
to the literature. A possible explanation for the different TOF of
Co-NC and conventional catalysts could be that the Co-NC approach
led to cobalt particles with a higher fraction of hcp Co, which is more active in FT than fcc Co.16−18,56 Alternatively, the Co-NC could
have less interaction with the support, because the Co-NC were formed
prior to attachment to the support. For example, when comparing the
TEM results of spent Co/SiO2, the grown particles of Co3/SiO2 were mainly confined between primary SiO2 particles
where the contact area with the support was maximal (Figure S7). The Co-NC in Co6/SiO2 and Co9/SiO2, on the other hand, were still distributed uniformly over
the support, and as such, a higher fraction of the cobalt surface
area would be accessible to reactants.

Overall, the employed
NC-based approach to catalyst synthesis yielded
well-defined model systems with reasonable control over the initial
NC size and relevant catalytic performance. It is therefore anticipated
that these model catalysts are suitable to investigate structure-performance
relationships, and already some interesting phenomena were observed
here, especially on the growth of NC of specific sizes under reaction
conditions. These observations will be investigated and discussed
in more detail in the next section.

Sintering of Cobalt Nanocrystals
To investigate the
growth of Co-NC, the particle sizes were analyzed using TEM after
reduction as well as after catalysis (Figure 4). The 3 nm Co-NC on TiO2 sintered
to particles of 10 nm already during reduction and grew further to
15 nm during FT. The 3 nm Co-NC on SiO2 ultimately grew
to the same extent, but in this case the particles predominantly sintered
during FT. The reduction barely affected the particle size of Co3/SiO2 even though the reduction was performed at 500 °C.

EDX maps of the reduced and passivated TiO2-supported
catalysts and Co3/SiO2 were quantified to investigate the
location of Co on the supports (Table 3, see Figure S8 for results
and experimental details). Compared to ICP (Table 1), the total cobalt loading from EDX was
30–50% higher on TiO2 and 50% lower on SiO2. Therefore, relative differences for one and the same sample were
considered more representative than the absolute values.

Table 3 Quantification of the Cobalt Present
in the Support and in Particles after Reduction of Co/TiO2 and Co3/SiO2a
sample	Cototal (wt %)	Coparticles (wt %)	Cosupport (wt %)	Coparticles/Cototal	Cosupport/Cototal	
Co3/TiO2	3.3	1.3	2.0	0.38	0.62	
Co6/TiO2	6.8	4.1	2.7	0.61	0.39	
Co12/TiO2	11	9.2	2.2	0.81	0.19	
Co3/SiO2	2.4	2.0	0.4	0.84	0.16	
a The total Co loading and the
fractions of Co in particles and Co in the support were derived from
HAADF-STEM-EDX (Figure S8).

For the reduced and passivated Co/TiO2 samples, ∼2.5
wt % of Co was found dispersed in the support and not in particles,
regardless of NC size and loading. In the case of Co3/TiO2, this amounted to approximately 60% of the total cobalt content
from EDX and might be partially responsible for its low CTY. Furthermore,
the Co signal in the EDX maps occasionally followed the contours of
TiO2 particles with increased intensity at the surface
(Figure S8). This means that a higher Co
concentration existed at the surface than in the bulk of the TiO2 particles. In contrast, only 16% of the Co was found on the
silica support for Co3/SiO2, and the remaining 84% was
still present in Co particles. Consequently, no contours of the support
were observed in the Co signal from EDX at locations without any particles
(Figure S8). These EDX results show that,
during reduction, cobalt migrated to the support more with TiO2 than with SiO2, as illustrated in Figure 4c,d. These cobalt species on
the support were not detected in XRD (Figure S9), probably because of their low concentration and/or low crystallinity.
Additionally, the amount of cobalt on the support was assumed to remain
constant during FT, because the Co/TiO2 catalysts did not
activate, which would be expected if the cobalt species on the support
were reduced under reaction conditions (Figure 3b).

Small particles have a higher thermodynamic
potential57 and are therefore more prone
to sintering.58,59 Interestingly, in these earlier
studies, growth took place via monomers
that were created upon exposure to CO under reaction conditions. For
example, in the case of Co/Al2O3, cobalt subcarbonyls
were proposed as monomers that migrate over the support and give rise
to particle growth via Ostwald ripening.60−62 However, in
our Co3/TiO2 sample, a large part of the growth took place
already during reduction, so sintering was not induced by CO. When
combining these results with the tendency of 60% of the cobalt in
the NC to “leach” to the surface of the TiO2, we propose that different mobile species, possibly cobalt titanates,63 spread out over the support and cause a few
particles to grow large. This hypothesis is in line with thermodynamic
calculations (Figure S10), which showed
that it is thermodynamically possible to form small amounts of cobalt
titanates under reduction conditions, and agrees with previous observations.64−66 Notably, Cats et al.64 observed a thin
layer of Co species surrounding TiO2 particles, albeit
in spent and not in reduced catalysts.

On SiO2, the
formation of cobalt silicates during reduction
is thermodynamically limited (Figure S10), and the growth of 3 nm Co-NC occurred mainly during FT. The sintering
might therefore be ascribed to CO-induced Ostwald ripening as observed
before by Kistamurthy et al.67 or particle
migration and coalescence. Furthermore, 8 h plasma cleaning of the
pristine samples to remove ligands reduced the particle growth for
Co3/SiO2 but not for Co3/TiO2 (Figure S11). This further confirmed that the mechanism responsible
for particle growth is different on both supports even though the
final particle size is similar.

The 6 nm Co-NC on TiO2 did not grow during reduction
(Figure 4). The driving
force for sintering during reduction was thus less than for Co3/TiO2 because of the larger particle size. However, the NC on TiO2 did grow to 11 nm during FT. Growth of the 6 nm Co-NC was
not observed on SiO2 even after catalysis, showing that
the Co-NC are less stable on TiO2 compared to SiO2. Interestingly, Co6/TiO2 had sintered less than IWI-Co/TiO2 after FT, with final particles sizes of 11 and 14 nm, respectively
(Figure S12). Because the average particle
sizes of both samples were initially comparable while the polydispersity
of IWI-Co/TiO2 was higher, this shows the impact of the
width of the particle size distribution on the stability of the cobalt
nanoparticles.68−70 It nicely illustrates the advantage of the NC-based
approach over the traditional synthesis techniques to arrive at more
stable catalysts.

On average, 12 nm Co-NC on TiO2 did not grow, but the
particle size distribution did become broader already after reduction
(Figure 4). Both smaller
and larger particles were thus formed, which implied Ostwald ripening
or redispersion of cobalt, possibly via cobalt-ion migration, under
reducing conditions. No evidence of Co-NC growth or redispersion was
apparent on Co9/SiO2 indicating that Co mobility was more
extensive with the TiO2 support or the somewhat larger
Co-NC sizes. Extending the reduction to 16 h instead of 8 h did not
change the particle size distribution of Co12/TiO2 further
(Figure S13). This observation is qualitatively
in line with the results of Xaba et al.71 on titania P25, although their Co particles were substantially larger
(∼50 nm).

The size evolution of individual Co-NC in Co12/TiO2 was
followed before and after reduction and passivation to investigate
the redispersion in more detail (Figure 5). No particles were found that had moved
from their original position, indicating low mobility of the Co-NC
as a whole and making migration and coalescence unlikely as a pathway
for particle growth during reduction. Furthermore, approximately 5%
of the particles broke up into multiple smaller particles (Figure 5c,d highlighted area, Figure S14). This redispersion caused an increase
in the fraction of 5–8 nm particles, resulting in broadening
of the particle size distribution.

Figure 5 Size evolution of individual Co-NC in
Co12/TiO2 during
reduction. (a,c) HAADF-STEM images of pristine Co12/TiO2 and (b,d) HAADF-STEM images of the same locations after reduction
at 350 °C for 8 h. The highlighted area contains two particles
that disintegrated during reduction and formed multiple smaller particles.

Two reasons can be proposed for
the disintegration of the NC. First,
it might be favorable for certain particles to maximize their contact
area with the support, since the interaction between metals and reducible
supports such as TiO2 can lead to dynamic systems under
reducing conditions.44 Second, the core–shell
structure in pristine Co12/TiO2 could be an intermediate
stage of the Kirkendall effect.11 Sasdavian
et al.45 investigated this effect for Co-NC
of different sizes on SiO2 and reported similar core–shell
particles in the case of incomplete oxidation of 29 nm particles.
Completely oxidized, hollow cobalt oxide particles of 29 nm disintegrated
into multiple smaller particles upon reduction, whereas smaller hollow
particles returned to their original size of 11 nm. Based on these
results, our 12 nm Co-NC, being similar in size to their 11 nm particles,
are not expected to disintegrate upon reduction.

Conclusions
Here, we investigated the preparation of well-defined TiO2- and SiO2-supported catalysts via colloidal synthesis
of Co-NC and evaluated their catalytic performance in the Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis. The 3–12 nm Co-NC were synthesized by a hot-injection
method, oxidized at low temperature to restrict magnetic interactions
and subsequently attached to TiO2 or SiO2. The
catalytic activity of most TiO2-supported samples was in
line with that of a Co/TiO2 sample prepared by impregnation
of cobalt nitrate, proving that relevant catalytic data was obtained
with these model catalysts. The cobalt-weight-based activity of 3
nm Co-NC on TiO2 was 5-fold lower than expected, and this
was partially ascribed to loss of cobalt to the support. Furthermore,
the TiO2-supported Co particles and 3 nm Co-NC on SiO2 sintered, while 6 and 9 nm Co-NC on SiO2 were
stable during reduction and FT. We showed that the interaction between
Co(O) and TiO2 was responsible for the decreased stability
of the Co-NC. This study illustrates the promise of synthesizing model
catalysts using colloidal techniques, as the high precision in particle
size enabled the investigation of effects that have not have been
revealed earlier with conventional synthesis techniques.
