The theoretical study of catalysis
would substantialy benefit from
the use of atomistic simulations that can provide information beyond
mean-field approaches. To date, the nanoscale understanding of surface
reactions has been only qualitatively achieved by means of kinetic
Monte Carlo coupled to density functional theory, KMC-DFT. Here, we
examine a widely employed model for oxygen interaction with the RuO2(110) surface, a highly anisotropic system. Our analysis reveals
several covert problems that render as questionable the model’s
predictions. We suggest an advanced approach that considers all the
relevant elementary steps and configurations while smoothing the intrinsic
errors in the DFT description of oxygen. Under these conditions, KMC
provides quantitative agreement to temperature-programmed desorption
experiments. These results illustrate how KMC-based simulations can
be pushed forward so that they evolve toward being the standard methodology
to study complex chemistry at the nanoscale.

1 Introduction
Understanding
microscopic processes at the nanoscale is one of
the crucial developments required to achieve atomistic engineering
in catalysis. Methods based on density functional theory, DFT, that
determine reaction profiles have been proven useful, but as the systems
become more complex, the analysis is less straightforward. Mean-field
microkinetic approaches based on DFT allow the integration of time
scales and can provide coverages, reaction orders, apparent activation
energies, and descriptors,1,2 but that might not yet
be enough. In this perspective, the successful implementation of multiscale
methods based on kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) techniques with parameters
obtained through DFT represents the most robust pathway to reach fully
consistent ab initio simulations. The main challenge ahead of KMC
is to derive quantitative data directly comparable to experiments,
an objective that seemed far-fetched just a few years ago.3

Compared with other mean-field approaches,
KMC properly addresses
surface anisotropy and lateral interactions4,5 but
implies a high computational burden because initial, final, and transition
states for a wide variety of local configurations need to be located
and updated for different local distributions.6 In addition, the accuracy problems that are intrisic to DFT are
amplified when calculating rates,7 and
in many cases, the calculation of the prefactors through statistical
mechanics is either overlooked, simplified, or reduced.8,9 As a consequence, despite the enourmous potential of KMC for the
study of catalytic reactions on materials, its application has been
confined mostly to qualitative interpretations.3 In the present manuscript, we show how for a truly monodimensional
system the kinetic Monte Carlo approach is accurate enough to address
the most stringent tests based on simulation of temperature-programmed
desorption data, provided that (i) all the relevant structures are
taken into account, (ii) the intrinsic errors of DFT are alleviated,
(iii) full statistical thermodynamic contributions in the transition
state theory are considered, and (iv) a sufficiently complex set of
lateral interactions is taken into account.

To this end, we
have chosen a highly anisotropic system, with industrial
interest and for which a large amount of experimental data has been
collected. RuO2 is a powerful catalyst in oxidation reactions10,11 that has industrial applications in the Deacon process.2,12 The most common (110) exposed surface presents a large anisotropy,
thus making it a wonderful scenario to test KMC techniques. From the
very beginning13 of active research on
RuO2, in-silico simulations3,7,14,15 were found essential
to understand12,16,17 its structural and catalytic features. Naturally, the interaction
of RuO2(110) with oxygen is the keystone in every oxidation
process on the surface and, considering the number of publications9,18−22 that cover various aspects of this interaction, one may expect the
subject to be well-understood and generally closed. Below, we show
that such a conclusion is premature.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of a RuO2(110) surface and of
its representation as a KMC simulation lattice. The dashed rectangle
shows the unit cell’s size. Under normal conditions, all the
bridge sites are occupied by oxygen atoms.

To the best of our knowledge, all existing models9,18,23 of chemical processes on RuO2(110) treat oxygen adsorption and desorption from the surface
as single step elementary reactions. At the same time, it is well
known22 that oxygen may be molecularly
adsorbed to the surface, and it may stay there in different possible
configurations20 prior to its dissociation.
Is it a must to be accounted for in a reliable model of RuO2(110) surface chemistry and whether it may be safely omitted in some
cases has not been discussed.

Figure 2 Energy levels of O2 on a RuO2(110) surface
(center), calculated for various configurations of molecular (O2, O2*, O2**) and
atomic (O*) oxygen, illustrated in the bottom. All the values are
given in eV. The black profile shows the actual output of DFT, and
the red one corresponds to an empirically corrected one (more details
in the text). The energies for O2* and 2O* configurations split into several
levels (α, β, γ) for different oxygen coverages
of the neighboring surface sites are shown on the left of the illustration
(the red frames show the targeted adsorption sites). Finally, the
one-step profile at the right corresponds to the oxygen adsorption
and desorption representation in ref (18).

2 Model and Methods
To approach the above-stated
question, we employ ab initio simulations
of RuO2(110) within density functional theory and kinetic
Monte Carlo techniques. DFT was performed in a p(1 × 2) supercell
(Figure 1). The data obtained were post-treated
by cluster expansion to reconstruct the energies of larger pieces
of the surface and to reveal the binding energies (Figure 2; the Supporting Information contains additional details) of oxygen molecules and atoms at the
cus sites of the surface. Our actual DFT values, shown at the figure
by the black profile, are somewhat different from those reported in
ref (20) as a result
of the use of different DFT functionals (RPBE instead of PW91). RPBE
is known to provide more accurate adsorption energies compared to
any other GGA functional.24 Still, available
DFT methods are not accurate in the prediction of oxygen dissociation
energy because of degeneration of the O2 ground state in
terms of both spin and orbit (3∏u and 3P, for O2 and O, respectively). The error is estimated25 as high as ζ = 0.56 eV in the case of
the RPBE functional. The value with our setup was reduced to 0.48
eV, but it is still large enough to significantly impact outcomes
of KMC simulations; thus, it must be compensated. From a comparison
to previous ways to overcome the problem26 and by analyzing the sensitivity of the KMC simulations series to
this particular parameter when compared with experimental data on
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of oxygen from RuO2(110), we learned that a shift of the DFT-calculated energy of oxygen
in the gas phase by 0.39 eV (70% of ζ) is necessary. Because
the molecularly adsorbed oxygen still bears some leftover spin, we
have correspondingly shifted the DFT-calculated energies of O2* (mono) and O2** (dihapto) configurations
by the values 0.08 and 0.04 eV, proportional to the gas-phase correction
and the remaining magnetic moment of the adsorbate. The resulting
corrected energy profile is shown in red in Figure 2, and it is referred to in the rest of discussion.

Let
us consider adsorption of an oxygen molecule to a cus surface
site, surrounded by oxygen atoms, as shown at the subimages α,
β, and γ of Figure 2. Once it has
approached the site, the O2 molecule binds by one of its
atoms to the Ru atom corresponding to the site (configuration O2*), and it gains
0.78 (case α) or 0.58 eV (cases β, γ), compared
with the energy in the gas phase. In the absence of close neighbors
in both directions along the cus row, the O2* state is not stable, as reorientation
of the molecule parallel to the surface with connection of its second
atom to the neighboring Ru (configuration O2**) gains an extra 0.16 (case α)
or 0.36 eV (cases β, γ), without any noticeable energy
barrier on the way. Further dissociation of the oxygen molecule is
controlled by a 0.57 eV activation barrier; once it is crossed, the
system finds itself at the energy level 1.43–1.58 eV below the initial O2 state. To sum up, at moderate coverages of O*, further O2 adsorption and desorption turn out to be the two-step process
O2 ⇄ O2** ⇄ 2O*, rather than the one-step process, O2 ⇄ 2O*, adopted in refs (9), (18), and (23) and in numerous other
works of the same research groups. One has to bear in mind that crowded
surfaces (or, at least, large occupation of active sites) are expected
under catalytic conditions.2 We also note
that the O2* state permits quite an easy diffusion of a separate oxygen molecule
along the cus row via “flip-flops”, O2**⇄ O2*, with only a small energy barrier
of 0.12 eV. For convenience, in the rest of article, we refer to the
our two-step model of oxygen desorption as M-II, and to the one-step
one as M-I.

To gain a deeper insight into the mechanics of oxygen
adsorption,
we need to calculate the rates of elementary reactions identified
above. According to transition state theory,9,27 the
rate of an elementary reaction is 1  where k and h are Boltzmann and Planck constants, T is the temperature
of the system, q′ and q0 are the partition functions of the system in the transition
and initial states of the reaction, and ΔE is
the activation energy. In the case of the molecular adsorption step
from the gas phase to the surface (O2→ O2** in our model,
and O2 → 2O* in the one-step adsorption models),
expression 1 must be additionally multiplied27 by pV/kT,
where p and V are the pressure and volume of the gas phase. Once it
is done, and the partition functions q′ and q0 are properly expanded, expression 1 turns27 into the well-known
result of kinetic gas theory 2  for nonactivated adsorption, where A is the area of adsorption site, and m is the mass of adsorbing molecule.

Fair calculation or experimental-based
fitting of partition functions
for the molecules adsorbed at the surface is far more challenging
than obtaining the adsorbates’ binding energies because it
demands the evaluation of all relevant vibrational frequencies of
the system in the initial and transitional states of the considered
elementary reaction. It is common practice, usually employed in the
implementations9,18,23 of M-I, to assume that q′ and q0′ are
equal to unity for the molecules and atoms adsorbed to the surface,
or in transition states corresponding to on-surface diffusion. In
our case, to reach a better accuracy, we calculate explicitly the
vibrational frequencies of the adsorbates in O2** and O* states, as well as in
the dissociation transition state of the elementary reaction O2** ⇄ 2O*,
and use these data to calculate all partition functions in our M-II
model (check the Supporting Information for details).

Figure 3 Temperature dependences (on top) of the rates of elementary
reactions
involved in oxygen adsorption to RuO2(110): O2 → O2** (solid blue for p = 1 bar, dashed blue for p = 10–10 bar); O2** → O2 (red);
O2** →
2O* (green); 2O* → O2** (oxygen association, thin black). The thick
black line shows the oxygen desorption rate according to our M-I model.
The bottom plot shows the absolute deviation of the black thick line
from the thin solid black one.

3 Results and Discussion
The calculated rates
are presented in Figure 3. For the best interpretation,
they should be examined alongside
the temperature desorption profile (Figure 4) corresponding22 to the desorption of
oxygen from cus sites. Desorption becomes possible around 400 K, when
the rate of desorption from the O2** state (red line on Figure 3) overrides the rate of dissociation from that state (green
line). However, the net rate of desorption is limited by the formation
of oxygen molecules from separate atoms (thin black line on Figure 3), because O2** state itself is very short-lived at temperatures
around 400 K. Comparison of this desorption-limiting rate to the oxygen
desorption rate according to M-I, as implemented in ref (18) (thick line on Figure 3), reveals why previously reported simulations of
the O2 TPD peak looked successful. The two lines (ref (18) and the present model)
intersect at T ≈ 470 K, and they are very
close to each other in the vicinity of the TPD peak. On the other
hand, the difference rapidly grows with small temperature changes.
It is not that important for the lower temperatures because there,
both lines show that desorption of an oxygen molecule from surface
is quite a rare event, but for temperatures above 500 K, the two models
predict radically different lifetimes of the O2 molecule
on the surface. Thus, for T = 600–800 K the
average time spent by an oxygen molecule on the cus-row of the surface
is two-3 orders of magnitude longer, according to M-II, than it is
predicted by M-I. It should be noticed that the industrially implemented
Deacon reaction (HCl oxidation) runs slightly below 600 K.12 Thus, the lifetime differences between the two
models is too large to rely on predictions of M-I when it is used
in the simulations of complex reaction networks on RuO2.

Experimental22 data (dashed) are shown
alongside with results obtained by KMC simulations in ref (18) (thick black) and by our
own KMC simulations with use of the model described in the present
work (thin black line). The red line shows a special postprocessing,
explained in the text, of our simulation results, that shows a perfect
match with the experimental measurements. All the peaks are normalized
for the same area.

At this point, we want
to highlight several issues that are not
obvious from the discussion so far. First of all, an additional argumentation
on the inconsistency of M-I model. The way the rate of 2O* →
O2 reaction is calculated9,18,23 within M-I, with the application of the microreversibility
condition between 2O* → O2 and O2→
2O* reactions and with the assumption of nonactivated adsorption,
implies that the transition state of the molecule during adsorption
and desorption is similar to the state in the gas phase and that the
energy of the molecule in this state is the same as in the atmosphere.
Somewhere along the way from this transition state to the surface,
the molecule must split into separate atoms. With the strength of
the oxygen’s double bond of De ≃
5.20 eV,28 this dissociation is possible
only due to the catalytic effect of the surface. However, such interaction
demands a very special binding of O2 to the surface (namely,
it should be in the state similar to the transition state between
O2** and 2O*
in M-II). Reaching such a transition state will be the bottleneck
of the dissociative adsorption and associative desorption because
the actual “effective” transition state is very different
from the one implicitly assumed in M-I.

We also have to emphasize
the errors brought into the rates by
the unjustified assumption that partition functions of molecules and
atoms adsorbed to the surface are approximately equal to unity. In
Figure 5, we compare the rates of the O2** → O2 and 2O* → O2** reactions of M-II as we calculate them (solid
lines) with their values calculated with approximations of partition
functions usually applied in implementations of M-I. In addition,
we compare them with the values obtained by shifting the energy barrier
values by ±0.1 eV (dotted lines). In the most interesting range
of temperatures for practical applications, T = 200–800
K, the 0.1 eV error in energies leads to subsequent errors in the
rates of 1–2 orders of magnitude. The approximation of the
partition functions leads to a smaller error for the oxygen association
reaction, but again, the error associated with the desorption of O2** → O2 has a similar size, 1–2 orders of magnitude, for the
temperatures below 400 K and above 700 K. The errors demonstrated
in these two examples can be tolerated in many particular cases, but
they obviously also may lead to crucial mistakes under other circumstances.
Thus, in general, an exact consideration of partition functions is
essential. Under reaction conditions, some kind of compensation29 between the rates and the coverages can be expected;
however, for very complex reactions, it would be impossible to assess
the correct behavior of this error cancellation.

Figure 5 Rates of O2** → O2 (red) and 2O* → O2** (black) reactions, calculated
according to our implementation of the M-II model (solid) are compared
with the approximate values obtained with partition functions of adsorbed
molecules and atoms set to unity (dashed) or with energy barrier value
modified by ±0.1 eV (dotted). The bottom plot shows the absolute
deviations of the approximate lines from the original ones.

Finally, we should notice that
the previous implementation9,18,23 of the M-I model has not taken
into account lateral interactions between the adsorbates. According
to our approach, for example, the binding energy of O2 shifts
(Figure 2) by 0.07–0.20 eV, depending on the coverage
of neighboring sites by oxygen atoms. According to the evaluation
provided above, such an energy shift results in a significant dependence
of the rates of elementary reactions on surface coverage by adsorbates.
Indeed, the explicit account of lateral interactions in M-II results
in a visible alteration of the calculated O2 TPD peak (Figure 4). Instead of the symmetric peak produced18 by the M-I model, the M-II model leads to a
clearly asymmetric profile, formed by several overlapping peaks of
different sizes, corresponding to oxygen desorption from nearby energy
levels, determined by the lateral interactions. The resulting peak
shape is much closer to the experimentally measured22 one. We have further improved the match of our calculated
profile with the experimental one by the application of smoothing 3  on the simulated oxygen desorption
signal f(t′), where t′
is the system’s time, and τ is a smoothing constant.
Underlying this formula is the fact that in an experimental setup,
desorption spectra are recorded as the amount of desorbed molecules
seen by a spectrometer’s detector at each moment of time. It
is natural to assume a finite delay between the actual desorption
of a molecule out from the sample’s surface and its registration
by the detector. Avoiding a complicated account for exact geometry
of an experiment, it is natural to assume that the mentioned delays
between desorption and registration of molecules are distributed exponentially,
effectively leading to smoothing 3 of the spectra.
The resulting TPD profile (Figure 4, red line),
calculated for τ = 4.0 s, matches the experimentally measured
one almost perfectly (dependence of the result on the choice of τ
is further explored in Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information). We consider that such smoothing efficiently imitates
the response curve of a spectrometer used in TPD experiments.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated some
features of a widely applied
model (M-I) of oxygen interaction with so-called cus sites of RuO2(110) surface. Although a number of works report successful
application of the M-I model (single step O2 adsorption/desorption)
for calculations of O2 temperature desorption profiles
and for investigation of various chemical processes on the RuO2(110) surface without visible problems, we have found significant
hidden differences in the oxygen desorption rates predicted by M-I
and our alternative, more complex, model, M-II. These differences
emerge from (i) oversimplification of the oxygen adsorption process
in M-I; (ii) the lack of lateral interactions of the adsorbates on
the surface; (iii) the assumptions on equality of partition functions
of adsorbed atoms and molecules to unity; and finally, (iv) intrisic
errors associated with the accuracy of DFT. Our results for the very
stringent test of O2 TPD, obtained with the use of the
M-II model, show a visible improvement in the shape of the simulated
desorption peak. We also expect that improvements of M-II compared
with M-I are crucial for simulations of complex chemical processes
on RuO2(110) surfaces, especially at temperatures above
500 K, where most of the interesting oxidation chemistry appears.12

We firmly believe that the analysis presented
paves the way for
a quantitave use of kinetic Monte Carlo tools for systems showing
high anisotropy at the nanoscale.
