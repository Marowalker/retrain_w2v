A Ni/photoredox dual catalytic cross-coupling
is disclosed in which
a diverse range of (hetero)aryl bromides are used as electrophiles,
with 1,4-dihydropyridines serving as precursors to Csp3-centered alkyl radical coupling partners. The reported method
is characterized by its extremely mild reaction conditions, enabling
access to underexplored cores.

==== Body
In the last decades, cross-coupling
reactions have become among the most highly used means to construct
new C–C bonds.1 However, despite
their numerous advantages, cross-coupling reactions, especially in
the context of Csp2–Csp3 bond formation, suffer from some limitations that hinder
their more widespread utilization. In particular, the high activation
energy barrier associated with the transmetalation step in the coupling
of many Csp3-hybridized nucleophiles results
in a need to use unstable and functional group-intolerant organometallic
reagents, negatively impacting the generality and operational simplicity
of these methods.2 In this regard, the
recently developed nickel/photoredox dual catalytic process has proved
to be an excellent alternative and complementary approach to overcome
such limitations.3 In such protocols, a
facile transmetalation-like event is triggered, being initiated by
single-electron oxidation of an organometallic reagent. The odd-electron
nature of this reactivity paradigm proceeds most rapidly with Csp3 coupling partners, effectively inverting the
reactivity hierarchy observed in more conventional cross-coupling
processes. As a result, reactive organometallic nucleophiles can be
replaced by a variety of functional group-tolerant radical precursors.

Among alkyl radical precursors, different partners have been previously
reported such as alkyltrifluoroborates,4 alkylsilicates,5 carboxylic acids,6 halides,7 and activated
C–H bonds.8 However, it remains
of utmost importance to introduce new feedstock functional groups
amenable to oxidative fragmentation, forming suitable alkyl radicals.9 Within this context, aldehydes represent an attractive
option because aliphatic aldehydes are abundant in nature and readily
available from commercial sources. Although nature has long ago developed
very effective means to promote oxidative deformylation reactions,10 such transformations still pose significant
challenges for the scientific community, which rely on two distinct
approaches (Scheme 1). First, an acyl radical can be formed through a hydrogen-atom transfer
(HAT) process, usually involving thiyl radicals. Subsequently, decarbonylation
delivers the targeted alkyl radical (route a).11 This latter step is usually slow, and acylated byproducts
are often observed. Alternatively, superoxometal complexes have been
employed (route b);12 however, strong,
stoichiometric oxidants are required, thus hampering the applicability
and breadth of substrates employed.

Scheme 1 Different Approaches
toward the Oxidative Deformylation of Aldehydes
Being aware of the inherent difficulties associated
with the formation
of alkyl radicals directly from aldehydes,13 we explored different aldehyde derivatives able to undergo photochemical
homolysis. 1,4-Dihydropyridines (DHPs) can be easily prepared from
aldehydes in one step, even with high functionalization levels,14 and their photochemical oxidation delivers hydrogen
(H2) with concomitant pyridine formation. However, in the
presence of alkyl substituents in position 4, the oxidation has been
shown to generate carbon-centered alkyl radicals.15 Importantly, the Nishibayashi group16 has successfully applied such an approach in aromatic substitution
reactions. More recently, Ma and Cheng coupled a variety of DHPs with
activated tertiary alkyl bromides under photocatalytic conditions.17

To ensure effective oxidative cleavage
of the 1,4-DHP (Eox = +1.05 V vs SCE),18−20 the organic
dye 4CzIPN (excited state Ered = +1.35
V vs SCE) was employed as a photocatalyst,21 and different nickel(II) sources were tested (Table 1, entries 1–5).22 As shown, dtbbpy outperformed other ligands tested, with
dMeObpy and bpy showing lower yields (entries 2–4 in Table 1). Interestingly,
the preformed [Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 afforded higher yields with no deleterious effects observed from
the water. Other photocatalysts were also explored (entries 6–8
in Table 1). Not surprisingly,
[Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 only delivered traces
of product, likely because of its low reduction potential (*Ered = +0.77 V vs SCE) whereas an Ir-photocatalyst
(entry 6 in Table 1) delivered the product in moderate yields (*Ered = +1.32 V vs SCE). The highly oxidizing organic photocatalyst
mesityl acridinium (*Ered = +2.06 V vs SCE)23 was next explored, but afforded no product,
likely because of its inability to reduce the putative Ni(I) intermediate.4j Consequently, 4CzIPN was chosen because of its
lower cost ($6.01/g), more straightforward preparation, and higher
activity.21 Finally, although other common
solvents for photoredox cross-coupling reactions were examined (entries
9 and 10 in Table 1), acetone outperformed both CH3CN and DMF. As anticipated,
control experiments showed that all parameters were essential for
the reaction to proceed.18 Importantly,
we observed complete consumption of 1a in the presence
of the photocatalyst, delivering the pyridine byproduct. Therefore,
in some cases, we decided to boost the reactivity by increasing the
amount of Ni-catalyst and DHP, thus obtaining higher yields. It should
be noted that the disclosed reaction conditions are particularly user-friendly,
allowing the construction of complex structural motifs in a “dump
and stir” fashion.

Encouraged
by these results, we turned our attention to study the
influence of several (hetero)aryl bromides in the reaction. As illustrated
in Table 2, different
(hetero)aryl bromides were well accommodated with aromatic substrates
(3bb and 3bc) and heteroaromatic entities
such as pyridine (3bd), thiazole (3be),
and thiophene (3bf–3bh). Notably,
we observed that 2-bromoheteroarenes were more reactive than other
heteroaryl bromides.24 Similarly, bifunctional
heteroaryl bromides bearing carbonyl moieties (2g, 2h) proved to be useful coupling partners, and the products
of these reactions thus contain reactive groups that can be used for
further elaboration.

Once the
versatility of the protocol was demonstrated against different
(hetero)aryl bromides, we decided to focus our attention on both the
DHP radical precursors and the aryl bromide partners simultaneously
in an effort to showcase the “real-world” utility of
this method in cases where both the nucleophilic
and electrophilic partner present structural and/or electronic challenges
(Table 3). The developed
reaction conditions were highly general, and various substitution
patterns were well accommodated. A diverse range of alkylated arenes
and heteroarenes were isolated in modest to high yields. Unactivated
secondary alkyl DHPs could be coupled independently of the cyclic
or acyclic nature of the radical. More interestingly, alkyl radicals
bearing distal alkenes (3da–3dh) were well tolerated.
No evidence of radical cyclization was observed for the melonal-derived
DHP (1h). A pyran-derived DHP could likewise be used,
and the resulting product was isolated in good yield (3gh). Importantly, even at almost 10-fold higher scale, the reaction
went to 60% yield without further optimization. Similar results were
achieved for a benzylic DHP when coupled with a challenging pyridine
(3hi). In addition to unactivated alkyl radicals, α-heteroalkyl
substrates could be employed. Pyrrollidine (1i), as well
as protected amino alcohol (1j) and amino acid-derived
(1k) DHPs all succeeded in delivering the cross-coupled
product, although in modest yields (Table 3).

To demonstrate further the applicability of the developed method,
the protocol was tested for the synthesis of two saccharide derivatives.
Previous literature reports for the synthesis of C-aryl glycosides via cross-coupling relied on the employment of alkenyl stannane25 or alkenyl boronate26 derivatives,
presumably because the alkyllithium intermediates required for the
synthesis of the requisite alkyl glycosidic stannanes
and alkyl boronates would suffer β-elimination
of the adjacent alkoxy group. Thus, current approaches require a cumbersome
synthesis of the dihydropyranylmetallics, followed by coupling and
hydrogenation. By contrast, for the present transformation, 1,4-dihydropyridines
from saccharides are readily available,14a and the particularly mild reaction conditions allow the formation
of saccharide-containing product (3lf) in good yield
and excellent diastereoselectivity. Access to 3fk demonstrates
that a fully deprotected carbohydrate core can be coupled, albeit
in modest yield. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1 Synthesis of aryl-containing saccharides, as in Table 1 (entry
1), 0.50 mmol scale. Isolated yield, average of at least two independent
runs. Using [Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 (10 mol %) and 1- (1.5 equiv). For 3lf and 3fk, diastereomeric ratio > 20:1.

The developed method does present a few limitations,27 because of the intrinsic stability of the radical
intermediate formed. Consequently, primary alkyl or cyclopropyl DHPs
did not succeed in delivering the cross-coupling product, because
oxidation of the DHP delivers only the 4-alkylated pyridine byproduct.15 Nonetheless, this is arguably a minor limitation,
considering complementary cross-coupling protocols available for primary
or cyclopropyl motifs.2a

Based on
our previous studies with alkyltrifluoroborates28 as well as previous studies detailing the photochemical
oxidative cleavage of DHPs,15,16 we propose the mechanistic
scenario depicted in Scheme 2. First, photoexcitation of the organic photocatalyst to its
excited state generates a
species that is a sufficient SET oxidant.21 At this point, the photocatalyst is oxidatively quenched by the
DHP derivative (1), thus forming a radical cation (not
pictured), which undergoes homolysis, delivering the carbon-centered
alkyl radical III. This radical reacts with active Ni(0)
catalyst (IV), forming the alkyl nickel(I) intermediate V, which undergoes further oxidative addition with the aryl
bromide (2), forming the Ni(III) complex VI.29,30 Subsequently, reductive elimination delivers
the cross-coupled product (3), along with Ni(I) complex VII, which can be reduced to Ni(0) by the reduced photocatalyst,
thus regenerating both active catalysts. We believe that the homolysis
of the DHP unit occurs via formation of a radical cation, followed
by a deprotonation step, forming an aminyl radical that will then
undergo homolysis.15,16 Notably, we observed that 1c-N-Me (the N-methylated
analogue of 1c) failed to deliver the cross-coupling
product under reaction conditions, thus supporting the deprotonation
prior to the C–C cleavage event hypothesis.15a

Scheme 2 Nickel/Photoredox Dual Catalysis: Mechanistic Rational
In summary, the use of DHPs
as radical precursors has allowed the
successful and general introduction of an interesting feedstock into
the dual Ni/photoredox cross-coupling toolbox. Because DHPs are derived
from their corresponding, commercially available aldehydes, previously
unrepresented radicals can be accessed, thereby expanding the chemical
space of Csp2–Csp3 cross-couplings. Importantly, the reaction is characterized by its
sustainability, as the only metal introduced in the entire process
is the base metal cross-coupling catalyst. The transformation furthermore
proceeds under extremely mild reaction conditions using visible light,
allowing the inclusion of diverse and unexplored coupling partners,
such as carbohydrate cores.31

The value is in agreement
with the previously reported: Eox = +0.654
V (Fc+/Fc) for 1a. See: Cheng J.-P. ; Lu Y. ; Zhu X.-Q. ; Sun Y. ; Bi F. ; He J.

Interestingly, 1a-CN (Eox = +1.34 V (SCE)) did not succeed
in delivering
the product. After oxidative fragmentation, the carbon-centered radical
appears to react preferentially with the pyridine byproduct, delivering
the 4-alkylated pyridine, which was observed in quantitative yield.

[Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 was prepared
using 1.0 equiv of NiCl2(H2O)6 and
1.0 equiv of dtbbpy (see the Supporting Information for detailed procedure and X-ray crystal
structure). [Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 is a bench-stable complex that simplifies the reaction setup, making
it more user-friendly.

Electron-rich aryl bromides
could not be
coupled because of a demanding oxidative addition step under the developed
reaction conditions, resulting in recovered starting material. On
the other hand, in those cases with moderate yields, the formation
of aryl chloride or protodebrominated starting material was observed,
thus indicating that the more demanding steps in those cases was not
the oxidative addition.

At this point, we cannot
rule out a mechanistic
scenario consisting of an oxidative addition of Ni(0) complex IV with the aryl bromide 2 followed by radical
addition, delivering Ni(III) complex VI.
