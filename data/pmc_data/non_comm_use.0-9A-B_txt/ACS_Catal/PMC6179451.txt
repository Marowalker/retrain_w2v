The
oxidation of the C–H and C=C bonds of hydrocarbons with
H2O2 catalyzed by non-heme iron complexes with
pentadentate ligands is widely accepted as involving a reactive FeIV=O species such as [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ formed by homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond of an
FeIII–OOH intermediate (where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine).
We show here that at low H2O2 concentrations
the FeIV=O species formed is detectable in methanol.
Furthermore, we show that the decomposition of H2O2 to water and O2 is an important competing pathway
that limits efficiency in the terminal oxidant and indeed dominates
reactivity except where only sub-/near-stoichiometric amounts of H2O2 are present. Although independently prepared
[(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ oxidizes stoichiometric
H2O2 rapidly, the rate of formation of FeIV=O from the FeIII–OOH intermediate
is too low to account for the rate of H2O2 decomposition
observed under catalytic conditions. Indeed, with excess H2O2, disproportionation to O2 and H2O is due to reaction with the FeIII–OOH intermediate
and thereby prevents formation of the FeIV=O species.
These data rationalize that the activity of these catalysts with respect
to hydrocarbon/alkene oxidation is maximized by maintaining sub-/near-stoichiometric
steady-state concentrations of H2O2, which ensure
that the rate of the H2O2 oxidation by the FeIII–OOH intermediate is less than the rate of the O–O
bond homolysis and the subsequent reaction of the FeIV=O
species with a substrate.

==== Body
Biomimetic analogues play a central
role in understanding bioinorganic systems and enzymes, particularly
in the identification of reactive intermediates and their role in
catalytic processes.1−4 In this context, high-valent iron oxo species (i.e., FeIV=O) have been studied intensely over the past decade,5−9 especially since their first isolation and crystallographic characterization
by Que and co-workers10 in 2003. The synthetic
non-heme FeIV=O complexes reported to date show
a broad range of reactivity, including C–H oxidation,7,11−14 with potencies comparable to those of non-heme and heme enzymes,
such as Tau-D, and cytochrome P450.15

High-valent FeIV=O species are frequently invoked
as the active species engaged in the oxidation of organic substrates
by both heme and non-heme enzymes5,7,16−18 and in biomimetic non-heme iron
catalysts. The FeIV=O species that have been isolated
to date are invaluable in determining their intrinsic reactivity,
and their continuous regeneration under catalytic conditions, with
H2O2 as terminal oxidant, is desirable in achieving
turnover in the oxidative transformations that they engage in.

The formation of FeIV=O species upon homolytic
O–O bond cleavage in the corresponding FeIII–OOH
complexes has been postulated to be a key step for the oxidation of
organic substrates by nonheme iron catalysts with H2O2:4,16,19 for example,
in the oxidative cleavage of DNA by bleomycin–FeIII–OOH.20,21 Notably, in contrast to heme
systems, where formation of FeV=O species is observed
via heterolytic O–O bond cleavage (followed by oxidation of
the porphyrin ligand to form compound I). Heterolysis
of the O–O bond in low-spin non-heme iron(III)–hydroperoxy
species is energetically unfavorable.22−24

However, to the
best of our knowledge, this process (FeIII–OOH →
FeIV=O) was observed only recently for high-spin
FeIII–OOH species but has not yet been seen for
low-spin FeIII–OOH complexes.25−29 Furthermore, the relatively low efficiency of non-heme
iron complexes in alkane oxidations with an excess of H2O2, together with the known reactivity of FeIV=O species with H2O2,30 casts doubt on the validity of this paradigm under catalytic
conditions.3

The absence of evidence
of the formation of FeIV=O species and loss of H2O2 through unproductive pathways (i.e., disproportionation)
can be rationalized by assuming that the generated FeIV=O species either reacts with H2O2 or
engages in, for example, C–H oxidation and hence the reaction
of FeIV=O with H2O2 competes
with its reaction with organic substrates. Indeed, Collins and co-workers
have shown that the FeIII(TAML) (TAML = tetraamidato macrocyclic
ligand) system disproportionates H2O2 through
a FeIV=O intermediate,2 and of direct relevance to the present study, the complex [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ (where N4Py is 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine)
was shown by Rohde and co-workers to react rapidly with H2O2 in acetonitrile.30

In the case of complexes based on pentadentate ligands, e.g., N4Py
(Figure 1), the apparent
stability of the FeIII–OOH intermediate and absence
of direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of FeIV=O from it make it challenging to identify the actual mechanisms
involved in substrate oxidation and H2O2 disproportionation.

Figure 1 Structures of the complexes and intermediates
discussed in the present study.

Here, using a combination of time-resolved UV–vis absorption,
(resonance) Raman, and EPR spectroscopy and computational chemistry,
we demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, the rate of O–O
bond homolysis in [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH]2+ to form [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ and a hydroxyl
radical is much lower than the rate of H2O2 disproportionation
observed under reaction conditions. We show that the FeIII–OOH species is responsible for H2O2 decomposition. As a result, the efficiency of substrate oxidation
is negatively affected by an increase in the steady-state H2O2 concentration, since formation of FeIV=O
species is uncompetitive.

Experimental Details
Synthesis
The ligand 1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)methanamine
(N4Py),31 [(N4Py)FeII(CH3CN)](ClO4)2 (1),21,31,32 and [(N4Py)FeIV=O](PF6)2 (4)33 were prepared as reported previously. Commercially available chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. All
solvents used for spectroscopy were of UVASOL (Merck) grade. H2O2 was 50 wt % in H2O from Sigma-Aldrich
and was diluted in methanol as required. The concentration of H2O2 in methanol was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy
(see Figure S7 for details).

Physical Methods
UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Specord600
(Analytik Jena) spectrophotometer in 1 cm (unless stated otherwise)
path length quartz cuvettes. Raman spectra at λexc 785 nm were recorded on a PerkinElmer Raman Station at room temperature.
Raman spectra at 355 nm (10 mW at source, Cobolt Lasers) were acquired
in a 180° backscattering arrangement. Raman scattering was collected
by a 2.5 cm diameter plano convex lens (f = 7.5 cm).
The collimated Raman scattering passed through an appropriate long
pass edge filter (Semrock) and was focused by a second 2.5 cm diameter
plano convex lens (f = 15 cm) into a Shamrock500i
spectrograph (Andor Technology) 2399 L/mm grating blazed at 300 nm,
acquired with an iDus-420-BU2 CCD camera (Andor Technology). The spectral
slit width was set to 12 μm. Data were recorded and processed
using Solis (Andor Technology) with spectral calibration performed
using the Raman spectrum of acetonitrile/toluene, 50/50 (v/v).34 EPR spectra (X-band, 9.46 GHz) were recorded
on a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer in liquid nitrogen (77 K) or a Bruker
EMX Nano spectrometer. Samples for measurements were transferred to
a quartz 3 mm EPR tube (0.5 mL) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
immediately, concurrent with monitoring by UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy.

Computational Details
Computational
studies were performed using ADF and QUILD,35−37 as reported
earlier.38 Briefly, geometry optimization
and frequency calculations were performed using the unrestricted density
functional BP86-D339−41 with a triple-ζ valence
plus polarization basis set on iron combined with a double-ζ
valence plus polarization on all other atoms (TDZP). Single-point
energy calculations on these geometries were made with the S12g spin-state
consistent functional42,43 in a triple-ζ valence plus
double polarization (TZ2P) basis set. Free energy (ΔG) corrections were obtained from the BP86-D3 data and are
corrected for zero point energy (ZPE); thermal and entropic corrections
were made from frequency calculations at 298 K. The solvation energy
was considered using methanol as a solvent with the COSMO solvation
model as implemented in ADF.44

Caution! The drying or concentration of solutions that potentially
contain H2O2 should be avoided. Prior to drying
or concentrating, the presence of H2O2 should
be tested for using peroxide test strips followed by neutralization
on solid NaHSO3 or another suitable reducing agent. In
work with H2O2, suitable protective safeguards
should be in place at all times due to the risk of explosion. In experiments
where complex 2 is mentioned, it was prepared by dissolution
of 1 in methanol (Figure S1).

Caution! In work with perchlorate salts,
suitable protective safeguards should be in place at all times due
to the risk of explosion. Perchlorate salts should be handled in small
(milligram) quantities and used only where necessary.

Results
and Discussion
Typically, acetonitrile is the solvent of
choice for the reaction of non-heme iron complexes with oxidants such
as H2O2.45 However,
in acetonitrile, the formation of [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH]2+ (3) is observed only with a large
excess (>50 equiv) of H2O2 and the subsequent
formation of [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ (4) has not been observed,21 despite
the fact that 4, prepared independently, is itself stable
in acetonitrile even at room temperature. This is in part due to the
stability (E1/2 = 1.2 V vs SCE) of [(N4Py)FeII–NCCH3]2+ (1) toward
electron transfer oxidation and in part due to the high binding constant
of the CH3CN ligand in comparison with water or H2O2. In the present study methanol was chosen to circumvent
the formation of such kinetically inert CH3CN complexes.
In methanol, the CH3CN ligand of 1 exchanges
immediately, to form 2 (which is either [(N4Py)FeII–OCH3]+or [(N4Py)FeII–HOCH3]2+ see the Supporting Information for a discussion), as manifested in
a decrease and red shift in the near-UV and visible absorption bands
(Figure S1).32 The exchange of the methanol/methoxido ligand for water and H2O2 is relatively rapid in both the ferrous and
ferric states (vide infra), which is central to enabling observation
of other species involved in the reactions discussed and is in stark
contrast to the slow ligand exchange seen for 1 in acetonitrile.

Reaction
of 2 with Near-Stoichiometric H2O2 and Homolysis of O–O Bond of [(N4Py)FeIII-OOH]2+
Addition of 0.6 equiv of H2O2 to 2 results in immediate (<2 s) conversion to [(N4Py)FeIII–OCH3)]2+ (5a)
with its characteristic X-band EPR spectrum at g =
2.29, 2.12, and 1.96.46 With 1.2 equiv
of H2O2, [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH]2+ (3) is obtained in minor amounts by both UV–vis
absorption and EPR spectroscopy (g = 2.16, 2.11,
and 1.98;21Figure S2). Addition of 2 equiv of H2O2 to 2 results in the formation of [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH]2+ (3) (Figure 2) by ligand exchange over 50 s at room temperature,
reaching a maximum of 14% (based on the absorbance at 550 nm, Figure 2-I) before decreasing
again over 1000 s. The decrease in absorbance at 550 nm (of 3) proceeds concomitant with an increase in absorbance at
692 nm due to FeIV=O (4, Figure 2-II/III). Since 4 reacts rapidly (200 s) with even stoichiometric H2O2 (vide infra), its appearance indicates that the concentration
of H2O2 in solution is already negligible by
80 s (vide infra). The absorbance at 692 nm remains almost constant
over 200 s during the decay of 3. The hydroxyl radical
formed due to O–O bond homolysis will react with methanol (9.7
× 10–8 s–1) to form a methoxy
radical that can react with H2O2 or other species
to yield either methanol or formaldehyde.

(bottom) Corresponding change in absorbance over time at 550 and 692
nm. Path length: 2 cm.

Once 3 has been fully consumed, the absorbance at 692 nm then decreases
concomitant with the formation of more [(N4Py)FeIII–OCH3]2+ (5a). These data are consistent
with a prior equilibrium between 5a and 3 followed by O–O bond homolysis to form 4. Once
sufficient H2O2 is consumed, the concentration
of 4 is dependent only on the rate of its formation from 3 and the rate of its loss by reaction with methanol (vide
infra). The rate of formation of 4 through homolysis
of the O–O bond of [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH]2+ (3) under these conditions is
low (<2.2 × 10–4 s–1,
vide infra), which is consistent with the reaction’s endergonicity;
calculated (see the Supporting Information) at 19.1 kcal mol–1. The value is also consistent
with the reported value calculated for the related homolytic cleavage
in activated Fe–bleomycin.18,23 1  

Disproportionation of H2O2 by 3 in Methanol
Addition of excess H2O2 (>40 equiv) to 2 in methanol results in immediate
oxidation to 5a (i.e., a complete loss in absorbance
at 450 nm within the mixing time, 2 s; Figure S3). The oxidation is followed by full conversion of 5a to [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH)]2+ (3) over 5–10 s. The H2O2 concentration
was monitored in real time by Raman spectroscopy. The second-order
rate constant for the formation of 3 from 5a, determined under pseudo-first-order conditions (2.5–50 mM
H2O2, Figure 3 and Figure S4), is 10.5(±0.1)
M–1 s–1 at 21 °C, consistent
with the exothermicity (−10.2 kcal mol–1)
and low barrier for the exchange of the sixth ligand. 2

EPR
spectra of samples flash frozen to 77 K (Figure S5) immediately after addition of an excess of H2O2 show two well-resolved S = 1/2 signals,
characteristic of 3 (major species) and 5a (minor species). Samples, flash frozen after 18 min, show that the
signals of 3 are diminished with the concomitant increase
of in the signals of 5a, and at ca. 50 min, the signals
of 3 are absent, leaving only a more intense signal from 5a.

Notably, both the maximum extent of formation of 3 and the time between addition of H2O2 and
the start of the subsequent decrease in the absorbance of 3 are dependent on the initial concentration of H2O2 (Figure 3).
These data indicate that H2O2 consumption is
relatively similar to the rate of formation of 3 from 5a. The rate of decrease of the absorbance due to 3 is independent of the initial H2O2 concentration
(Figure S6), because the decay occurs only
after essentially all of the H2O2 has been consumed,
as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (λexc 785 nm, Figure 4). Time-resolved
Raman spectroscopy shows that the concentration of H2O2 decreases from t = 0 while the resonantly
enhanced bands of 3 (FeIII–OOH) at
632, 650, 670, and 798 cm–1 do not decrease in intensity
until the signal (ν(O–O)) from H2O2 at 872 cm–1 has decreased to near-stoichiometric
levels at least (i.e., below the limit of detection of ca. 10 mM, Figure S7).

5 mM) in methanol over time after addition of 50 equiv of H2O2 at λexc 785 nm. (bottom) Change in
intensity of Raman bands at 872 (of H2O2) and

Spectra correspond to the data points shown.

Regeneration of FeIII–OOH and O2 Evolution
For the absorption at 550 nm and its EPR signals, the characteristic
Raman bands of 3 appear within the time resolution of
the measurement (<60 s) upon addition of excess H2O2 and maintain their intensity until all H2O2 has been consumed. These data are consistent with the continuous
regeneration of 3 from [(N4Py)FeIII–OR)]2+ (where R = H, CH3) and H2O2. 3 is the resting state in the cycle, and the formation
of 3 from 5a is a rapid equilibrium prior
to the rate-determining step in the reaction.

Headspace analysis
by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 5 and Figure S8) confirms generation
of O2 at a rate corresponding to the rate of decrease of
H2O2. Details for the quantification of O2 generated are provided in section 3 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 5 (left) Raman spectra (λexc 532 nm) obtained from the headspace above the reaction mixture containing 1 (0.25 mM) and 200 mM H2O2 in methanol
at 21 °C. (right) Change in intensity of Raman band at 1555 cm–1 of O2 (head space, red, λexc 532 nm, internal reference was 2329 cm–1 band
of N2) and at 872 cm–1 for H2O2 (liquid phase, black, λexc 785 nm).

The relation between the rate
of consumption of H2O2 and concentration of 3 is apparent when H2O2 is present in
excess (>50 equiv). The concentration of 3 remains
constant (>80% of total iron concentration) for a period of time,
the duration of which is dependent on the initial concentration of 2 (Figure S8). The concentration
of H2O2, determined by Raman spectroscopy, during
this period shows an exponential decay (Figure 6 and Figure S9). The observed rate constant (kobs)
for the decomposition of H2O2 is linearly dependent
on the catalyst concentration (i.e., [3], Figure 6), with a second-order rate
constant of 0.8 M–1 s–1 at 21
°C (Figure S9). The rate constant
is less than that for the formation of 3 (10.5(±0.1)
M–1 s–1) and is thus in agreement
with 3 as the resting state in the catalytic cycle under
steady-state conditions.

Reaction of [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ (4) with Methanol and
H2O2
The self-decay rate of 4 (prepared independently),33 due to reaction
with solvent, is low in acetonitrile30 but
is significant in methanol (Figure 7). In methanol, the NIR absorbance of 4 decays exponentially over 1000 s with the concomitant production
of 1 equiv of 5a (FeIII–OCH3) and 0.5 equiv of formaldehyde (see the Supporting Information for details). The kinetic isotope effect for this
decay in CD3OD is ca. 10 (Figure 7).33 OH/OD exchange
does not affect this rate, which is consistent with the competence
of 4 in the oxidation of methanol with a rate-determining
hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) step at the C–H bond.

Figure 7 Normalized
absorbance of 4 (1 mM) at 692 nm in CH3OH
(blue), CH3OD (red), and CD3OD (black) with
time in the (a) absence and (b) presence of 1 equiv of D2O2. Corresponding UV–vis spectra are shown in Figure S10.

Addition of 1 equiv of H2O2 to 4 (FeIV=O) in methanol results in conversion to 5a (FeIII–OCH3) within 200 s,
in agreement with data reported in acetonitrile (second-order rate
constant of 8 M–1 s–1 at 21 °C),30 and is ca. 10 times faster than the reaction
of 4 with CH3OH. However, in stark contrast
with the 2:1 ratio of 4 to H2O2 required in acetonitrile30 for full reduction
of 4 to the FeIII state, in methanol only
1 equiv of H2O2 is required (Figure S10). In both solvents the need for excess H2O2 (>0.5 equiv) indicates that H2O2 is consumed by other pathways. 3  

The OH/D kinetic isotope effect observed in the reduction
of 4 with H2O2 is masked to some
extent by the competing reaction of 4 with CH3OD (vide supra) but is nevertheless consistent with an HAT mechanism.

In contrast to CH3OH, in CD3OD the
decay of 4 upon addition of 1 equiv of D2O2 is biphasic. Deuterium atom abstraction (from C–D
in CD3OD) by 4 is much slower than the reaction
of 4 with 1 equiv of D2O2. Consequently,
the initial rate (i.e., within 10 min after addition of D2O2, 1.13 × 10–3 s–1) of decay in the absorbance of 4 is due to reaction
with the peroxide only. After this period the rate of decay decreases
(to 9.5 × 10–5 s–1), which
corresponds to the decay of 4 in CD3OD alone
(Figure 7b). A biphasic
decay is observed in CH3OD also but is much less pronounced
due to the relatively rapid rate of reaction of 4 with
CH3OD also.

These data indicate that, in addition
to reaction with 4, D2O2 is consumed
through a second pathway, i.e. by the FeIII species formed
initially, which is only apparent when the background reaction of 4 with solvent is slow (i.e., in the case of CD3OD). The decreased extent of reduction of 4 with 1 equiv
of D2O2 is similar to that observed in acetonitrile
earlier.30 Although calculation of the
KIE for reaction of 4 with H2O2/D2O2 is estimated as close to 10, indicating
that HAT is likely to be rate limiting, the occurrence of several
reactions in parallel precludes mechanistic interpretation of this
value.

With excess H2O2 (40 equiv) in
CH3OH, the characteristic NIR absorbance of 4 disappears over 10 s, while that of 3 (FeIII–OOH, Figure S11) appears concomitantly.
These data indicate that the reduction of 4 to 5a by H2O2 is followed by ligand exchange
with H2O2 to form 3. Thereafter,
the spectral changes are essentially the same as those observed upon
addition of H2O2 to 2 in methanol.

In summary, the rate of reaction of 4 follows the
order H2O2 (in CH3OH) > D2O2 (in CH3OD) > D2O2 (in CD3OD). Notably, the presence of even 1 equiv
of H2O2 precludes the presence of 4 in methanol, rationalizing the fact that 4 can be observed
only when the concentration of H2O2 is substoichiometric.
The rate of reduction of 4 by H2O2 in acetonitrile was reported by Braymer et al.30 to be insensitive to deuteration (i.e., D2O2). In retrospect this observation can be understood by considering
the need for an excess of H2O2 in that case
and the fact that 4 is not the sole species capable of
reacting with H2O2.

Mechanistic Considerations
The paradigm for oxidation catalysis with complexes such as 2 and H2O2 is rapid oxidation to the
ferric state and formation of hydroperoxido complexes (e.g., [(N4Py)FeIII–OOH)]2+, 3). Homolytic cleavage
of the O–O bond in 3 yields [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and a hydroxyl radical,
both of which are responsible for oxidation of organic substrates.
In the present case, only 3, and not 4,
is observed in the presence of excess H2O2 (Figures 2 and 3), which is consistent with the homolytic cleavage of the
O–O bond in 3 being rate determining.

The
efficiency in the oxidation of organic substrates is diminished substantially
in the presence of excess H2O2 due to disproportionation
to H2O and O2. In the present study, independently
prepared 4 is shown to be reduced to the ferric state
in methanol rapidly upon addition of H2O2. Hence,
the fact that 4 is not observed in the presence of excess
H2O2 can be ascribed to this reaction pathway
(b in Scheme 1). Indeed,
[(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ (4) reacts
with H2O2 (k = 8 M–1 s–1) much more rapidly than the observed rate
of decomposition of H2O2 (k = 0.8 M–1 s–1). However, pathway
b (Scheme 1) will be
kinetically possible only if the rate of the O–O bond homolysis
of 3 is sufficiently rapid to account for the rate of
decomposition of H2O2.

Scheme 1 Possible Mechanisms for Reaction of 2 with Excess H2O2
In the present
study several observations cast doubt on the validity of pathway b.
In methanol, the formation of 4 from 3 is
observed once (nearly) all H2O2 has been consumed;
however, the rate of this reaction is much lower (<3.0 × 10–3 s–1, Figure 2) than expected.
DFT calculations (vide infra) indicate that the cleavage of the O–O
bond is substantially uphill and is accompanied by a low barrier to
return to 3 (and hence has an intrinsically substantial
thermal barrier). Consequently, the rate of formation of [(N4Py)FeIV=O]2+ (4) is insufficient
to account for the decomposition of H2O2 when
H2O2 is present in excess. This conclusion holds
the further consequence that the formation of 4 and hence
the oxidation of organic substrates by 4 is not competitive
with oxidation of H2O2 by 3 (pathway
a, Scheme 1). The consequence
of this is that the oxidation of organic substrates is only competitive
under conditions of low H2O2 concentration.

DFT Calculations
The mechanism and comparison of two
possible pathways for the reaction of 3 with H2O2 were explored through DFT calculations. Geometry optimization
and frequency calculations were carried out at the BP86-D3/TDZP level, with subsequent single point energies at the S12g/TZ2P
level, including COSMO-ZORA self-consistently at all stages. All data
are given in the Supporting Information.

The doublet ground state calculated for 3 is
in accordance with experiment. However, for consistency, the reaction
pathways a and b (Scheme 1) were calculated in all three possible spin states: doublet,
quartet, and sextet (Figure S12). For both
pathways the reaction barriers are much lower in the low-spin state
in comparison to those in the other two spin states, and hence the
discussion below considers only the low-spin states (Figures 8 and 9).

Figure 8 Comparison of energy
profiles (in kcal mol–1) of pathway a (catalase,
in red) and pathway b (homolysis, in black), as obtained at the S12g/TZ2P//BP86-D3/TDZP level. (The complete structures indicated in the profile
can be also found in Figure 9.)

Figure 9 Geometries (bond distance in Å) for
key species for both path A (catalase) and path B (homolysis).

For the disproportionation pathway a, the reactants, 3 + H2O2, initially form a reactant
complex (RC) where the peroxide is bound to the iron complex weakly.
This step is followed (in TS1) by hydrogen atom abstraction from the
peroxide toward the distal OH group of 3, and simultaneously
cleavage of the O–O bond of 3 takes place with
a barrier of only 3.2 kcal mol–1. In this TS, the
O–O bond in 3 elongates from 1.60 to 2.14 Å,
together with a shortening of the H–(OH) distance to 1.45 Å.
This is followed by a highly exergonic (−32.6 kcal mol–1) completion of the hydrogen atom transfer process
to form H2O in the intermediate (INT). Simultaneously,
the O–O bond of the peroxide shortens from 1.49 to1.35 Å.
Formation to the product from INT involves a second hydrogen atom
abstraction (barrierless in terms of Gibbs free energy (−1.0
kcal mol–1) and electronic energy (+1.1 kcal mol–1)) in which the remaining hydrogen of the peroxide
is transferred to the oxygen coordinated to iron. This second HAT
is exergonic by ca. −17.0 kcal mol–1 and
finally leads to the products FeIII–OH + H2O + O2.

In contrast, the homolysis pathway b initially
forms a similar weakly bound complex in the RChomo. However,
the activation barrier (10.7 kcal mol–1) for homolytic
cleaving of the O–O bond of 3 in TShomo alone to form FeIV=O is much higher than that
in pathway a. The O–O bond in 3 elongates from
1.51 to 2.63 Å with hardly any change in the structure of the
peroxide: i.e., the peroxide does not participate actively in the
reaction but merely acts as a hydrogen-bond donor. More importantly,
the product for this homolytic pathway b, Phomo, is so
close in energy to the TShomo (<2 kcal mol–1) that it readily undergoes the reverse reaction to the initial reactants.

These data are consistent with the observed low rate at which 4 forms from 3 and the rapid consumption of H2O2 by direct reaction of 3 with hydrogen
peroxide in the disproportionation pathway a.

In summary, there are two pathways
that should be considered for the decay of 3. The first
is a unimolecular homolysis to form 4 (FeIV=O) and a hydroxyl radical. This process is slow and only
occurs when the concentration of H2O2 is sufficiently
low such that it is outside of the solvation sphere of 3. In this case, both 4 (FeIV=O) and
HO• are eventually formed and are responsible for
the oxidation of organic substrates (i.e., methanol), and hence it
is a productive reaction.

At higher concentrations of H2O2, i.e. where H2O2 is likely to be within the
solvation sphere of 3, the formation of two H bonds supports
the breaking of the O–O bond of 3, and either
(Scheme 2) (i) stabilizes
the formation of 4 (“insertion” of H2O2 into the O–O bond of 3)
or (ii) undergoes HAT to form water and HOO• from
H2O2 and, in a subsequent step, a second HAT
from HOO• by FeIV=O to form [(L)FeIII(OH)]2+ (5b) and dioxygen.

Scheme 2 Homolysis of the O–O Bond in 3 To Form 4 vs Reaction of 3 with
H2O2
Our computational data show that the barrier (Scheme 2) to pathway i is substantial and endergonic
(10.7 kcal mol–1), even with stabilization through
H bonding with H2O2. The barrier to pathway
ii is much lower (ca. 3.2 kcal mol–1), and leads
to the generation of dioxygen (observed experimentally). Hence, in
the presence of H2O2, 3 is almost
exclusively transformed into 5b, with subsequent solvent
exchange to 5a (and subsequently through the exchange
of methoxido by another H2O2 back to 3). Therefore, in the presence of excess H2O2, disproportionation into H2O and O2 is the
more energetically favored pathway.

Regardless of the pathway, the
observed reactivity presents a dichotomy toward the use of complexes
such as 2 for oxidation catalysis. 3 (FeIII–OOH) does not appear to react directly with organic
substrates (Figure S13),47 and hence formation of 4 (FeIV=O)
and a hydroxyl radical from 3 through O–O bond
homolysis is required. However, both 3 (FeIII–OOH) and 4 (FeIV=O) react
with H2O2 more readily than with methanol. Therefore,
ideally the steady-state concentration of H2O2 should be held as low as possible, yet still sufficiently high to
generate 3 and subsequently 4 (FeIV=O)/HO•. Hence, the rate of addition of
H2O2 should affect the relative efficiency of 2 in the oxidation of organic substrates, as shown below for
the oxidation of methanol.

Competition between the Oxidation of Methanol
and H2O2 Disproportionation Catalyzed by 2
The oxidation of methanol to methanal occurs concomitantly
with the conversion of 4 (FeIV=O) to
[(N4Py)FeII–OCH3)]+ (vide
supra). However, the rate of this reaction is sufficiently low to
exclude it as being an important pathway for 2 in the
presence of excess H2O2 (i.e., both FeIII–OOH and 4 (FeIV=O) react much
more rapidly with H2O2 than with methanol).
A number of competing kinetically competent pathways are thus available
in the reaction of 2 with H2O2,
and variation in the steady-state concentrations of reaction components
should indicate the relative importance of each of these pathways.

With an 800-fold excess of H2O2, ca.
27% of H2O2 is disproportionated to H2O and O2 (see the Supporting Information for a detailed O2 concentration calculation), with only
2% generating formaldehyde (Figure 10, bar on the far left). Addition of fewer equivalents
of H2O2 (second bar from the left) results in
a substantial increase in the efficiency in the use of H2O2 to oxidize methanol, which increases further by addition
of the same amount of H2O2 slowly (Figure 10, the two rightmost
bars). Adding fewer equivalents slowly over the same time does not
increase efficiency further, nor does a change in the concentration
of the catalyst (0.25 vs 0.125 mM), since overall conversion rates
are controlled by the rate of addition. These data are consistent
with the self-decay rate of 4 (FeIV=O)
(vide supra), setting the upper limit for the rate of addition of
oxidant to achieve maximum efficiency.

Figure 10 Oxidation
of methanol (solvent) with H2O2 catalyzed by 1 (0.25 mM). HCHO was quantified colorimetrically (see the Supporting Information for details). The number
of equivalents of H2O2 is with respect to 2. Slow addition of H2O2 indicates a rate of addition of 0.4 equiv min–1 (the two rightmost bars).

Conclusions
The
species accepted, i.e. FeIV=O, to be responsible
for the oxidation of organic substrates by most non-heme iron catalysts
is formed from an FeIII–OOH precursor through O–O
bond homolysis, liberating a hydroxyl radical concomitantly. Roelfes
and co-workers3 have noted that, in systems
where low-spin FeIII–OOH species are generated (with
excess H2O2) and observed, the corresponding
FeIV=O species is not observed.

Here we show
that, in the case of non-heme N5 coordinated iron complexes that form
observable FeIII–OOH species, two key reasons can
be invoked to rationalize the absence of a corresponding FeIV=O species. The first is that, even if it does form, it reacts
rapidly and unproductively with H2O2 rather
than with an organic substrate. Second, and unexpectedly, FeIII–OOH (3) reacts more rapidly with H2O2 in comparison to the rate that it undergoes O–O
bond homolysis to form an FeIV=O species in the
first place.

Ligand exchange, i.e. FeIII–OR
to FeIII–OOH (3), precedes the oxidation
of both organic substrates (eq 2) and H2O2 (eq 3). In the present study we show that O–O
bond homolysis is relatively slow and is not competitive with the
oxidation of H2O2 to O2 by 3. The reaction bifurcation seen for FeIII–OOH
presents a dichotomy in that H2O2 must be present
in order to form FeIV=O (4), but the
steady-state concentration of H2O2 should be
less than that of FeIII–OOH (3), in
order that O–O bond homolysis to form FeIV=O
and a HO• radical can take place and hence oxidation
of organic substrates to occur. Hence, efficiency with respect to
oxidation of organic substrates is increased, as observed in the present
study, by maintaining a low steady-state concentrations of H2O2.

In conclusion, we show that the oxidation of
organic substrates by reactive iron species competes with the reaction
of these same species with H2O2 and hence wasteful
disproportionation of the terminal oxidant. A substantial increase
in oxidant efficiency is achieved by maintaining a pseudo-steady-state
concentration of H2O2 that is below that of
the catalyst itself. Furthermore, far from only being a metastable
intermediate on route to an FeIV=O species, the
FeIII–OOH complex is kinetically competent in its
reaction with H2O2. The conclusions reached
in the present study have implications with regard to our approach
to oxidation catalysis with iron catalysts with pentadentate ligands
and in a wider perspective hold implications for the mechanisms invoked
for catalase type reactions in both biomimetic and bioinorganic systems.
