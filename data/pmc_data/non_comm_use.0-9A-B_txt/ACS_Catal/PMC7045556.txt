Aromatic
β-hydroxyaldehydes, 1,3-diols, and α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes are valuable precursors to biologically active natural products
and drug molecules. Herein we report the biocatalytic aldol condensation
of acetaldehyde with various aromatic aldehydes to give a number of
aromatic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes using a previously
engineered variant of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase [4-OT(M45T/F50A)]
as carboligase. Moreover, an efficient one-pot two-step chemoenzymatic
route toward chiral aromatic 1,3-diols has been developed. This one-pot
chemoenzymatic strategy successfully combined a highly enantioselective
aldol addition step catalyzed by a proline-based carboligase [4-OT(M45T/F50A)
or TAUT015] with a chemical reduction step to convert enzymatically
prepared aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes into the corresponding
1,3-diols with high optical purity (e.r. up to >99:1) and in good
isolated yield (51–92%). These developed (chemo)enzymatic methodologies
offer alternative synthetic choices to prepare a variety of important
drug precursors.

==== Body
The aldol reaction is one of
the most important methodologies for the straightforward construction
of carbon–carbon bonds in synthetic organic chemistry.1 This reaction allows complex chiral compounds
to be rapidly assembled from simpler building blocks. Enzyme catalysis
by using native and engineered aldolases offers a powerful strategy
to perform this transformation.2 With the
discovery and engineering of novel aldolase activities, an increasing
number of applications of aldolases in stereoselective synthesis have
been reported.2e,2i Despite the rapidly expanding
biocatalytic toolbox, aldolases that can use various aromatic aldehydes
as acceptors for acetaldehyde addition are rare.2f−2h Such aldolases
would provide an attractive synthetic tool for the preparation of
chiral precursors to various biologically active compounds and drug
molecules.

Our group has previously reported that the enzyme
4-oxalocrotonate
tautomerase (4-OT) from Pseudomonas putida mt-2 promiscuously
catalyzes the cross-condensation of acetaldehyde (1)
with benzaldehyde (2a) to give cinnamaldehyde (4a) (Scheme 1).3 It has been shown that 4-OT catalyzes
both the initial aldol addition to yield 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanal
(3a) as well as the subsequent rapid dehydration of 3a to give 4a, preventing the accumulation of
chiral aldol adduct 3a in the reaction mixture.3a Rahimi and co-workers applied mutability landscape-guided
protein engineering to further improve this promiscuous aldolase activity
of 4-OT. This resulted in the identification of a double mutant, 4-OT
M45T/F50A, with a remarkable 3300-fold improved catalytic efficiency
(in terms of kcat/Km) over wild-type 4-OT.3b

Scheme 1 4-OT Catalyzed Aldol Condensation of Acetaldehyde
(1) with Benzaldehyde (2a) To Yield Cinnamaldehyde
(4a)
Although cinnamaldehydes
are valuable synthons in their own right,
we were especially interested in the enzymatic preparation of chiral
aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes and the corresponding 1,3-diols,
which are important precursors to various natural products, bioactive
compounds, and drugs (Figure 1).4,5 We envisioned that these chiral aldol adducts
could be constructed by the enzymatic addition of acetaldehyde to
selected aromatic aldehydes, yielding β-hydroxyaldehydes that
are not (or slowly) dehydrated, allowing their accumulation in the
reaction mixture. Chemical reduction of the enzymatically prepared
aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes would provide access to the corresponding
aromatic 1,3-diols, which are key intermediates in the synthesis of
drugs such as Fluoxetine (Figure 1).5

Figure 1 Chiral aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes
and cinnamaldehydes are
valuable precursors to biologically active compounds and drugs.

Herein we report the 4-OT(M45T/F50A)-catalyzed
synthesis of various
aromatic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, starting from acetaldehyde
and a number of aromatic aldehydes, in good isolated yields. We also
report the one-pot, two-step chemoenzymatic asymmetric synthesis of
various aromatic 1,3-diols with high optical purity (e.r. up to >99:1)
and in good isolated yield (51–92%). This chemoenzymatic strategy
highlights a highly stereoselective aldol addition of acetaldehyde
to diverse aromatic aldehydes, catalyzed by either 4-OT(M45T/F50A)
or the newly identified carboligase TAUT015, yielding various enantioenriched
aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes, which are chemically reduced into
the corresponding 1,3-diols in the same pot. The applied carboligases
accept a broad range of aromatic aldehydes for acetaldehyde additions,
offering alternative synthetic choices to prepare important drug precursors.

We previously reported that an engineered variant of 4-OT (mutant
M45T/F50A) can efficiently catalyze the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde
(1) with benzaldehyde (2a) to yield cinnamaldehyde
(4a).3b This prompted us to
start our investigations by testing a large set of 25 aromatic aldehydes
(2b–y and 2ac) as potential
aldol acceptor substrates in the 4-OT(M45T/F50A)-catalyzed aldol reaction
with donor substrate 1 (Scheme 2). The results demonstrate that the 4-OT(M45T/F50A)
enzyme has a remarkably broad substrate scope, accepting 19 aromatic
aldehydes with electron withdrawing substituents (2b–t) as aldol acceptor substrates (Scheme 2, Figures S1–S19). On the contrary, aromatic aldehydes with electron-donating substituents
(2u–y and 2ac) were
not, or very poorly, accepted by 4-OT(M45T/F50A) (Scheme 2, Figures S20–S24, S28). While this may be attributed to unfavorable
equilibrium constants for these aromatic aldehydes in the aldol addition
with acetaldehyde, the electron donating properties of the substituents
on the aromatic ring likely also lead to weak activation of the carbonyl
carbon for nucleophilic attack.2j,2l

Scheme 2 Enzymatic Aldol Reaction
of Acetaldehyde (1) with Various
Aromatic Aldehydes (2) Using Promiscuous Proline-Based
Tautomerases as Carboligases
Out of the 19 well-accepted aromatic aldehydes, 14 substrates undergo
an aldol condensation reaction with formation of the corresponding
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, whereas five substrates (2k–n and 2s, see below) undergo
conversion without significant formation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes (Figures S1–S19). To demonstrate
the synthetic usefulness of 4-OT(M45T/F50A) for the preparation of
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, nine aromatic aldehydes (2b–d, 2f–j, and 2t) that could be efficiently converted by 4-OT(M45T/F50A)
were selected and used in semipreparative scale synthesis (Scheme 3). The corresponding
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (4b–d, 4f–j, and 4t) could be isolated in moderate to good yields (Scheme 3, Figures S30–S47). Notably, ortho-substituted
benzaldehydes (e.g., 2b, 2f, 2h, and 2i) were better accepted by 4-OT(M45T/F50A) than para-substituted benzaldehydes (2p, 2r, 2o, and 2q).6 These results underscore the potential of 4-OT(M45T/F50A) for the
synthesis of versatile aromatic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes,
which are important precursors to various abundantly prescribed drugs
(Figure 1).4f

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Aromatic α,β-Unsaturated
Aldehydes from
Simpler Building Blocks Using the Carboligase 4-OT(M45T/F50A)
Reaction conditions:
reaction
mixtures consisted of 100 mM 1, 3 mM 2,
and 0.1 mg/mL 4-OT (M45T/F50A) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 5%
DMSO v/v, pH 7.3. The reaction volume was 60 mL. bReaction
time (48 h, 72 h for 2t). cPurified by silica
gel column chromatography.

Interestingly,
for the 4-OT(M45T/F50A)-catalyzed aldol addition
of 1 to 2k–n and 2s, depletion of the starting substrates was observed without
significant accumulation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes (Figures S10–S13, S18).
These results led us to hypothesize that in these instances the initially
formed aldol adducts, β-hydroxyaldehydes 3k–n and 3s, were not (or slowly) dehydrated and
accumulated in the reaction mixture. To confirm this hypothesis, an
analytical scale experiment was performed using 4-OT(M45T/F50A) in
NaPi buffer (0.3 mL, pH 7.3, 5% DMSO), containing 1 (50
mM) and 2k (2 mM). Reaction progress was monitored by
following the depletion of 2k by UV–vis spectrophotometry,
and NaBH4 was added to the reaction mixture (after 1 h)
to convert the aldol adduct into the more stable 1,3-diol 5k. Analysis of chemoenzymatic product 5k by HPLC on a
chiral stationary phase, using authentic standards with known absolute
configuration, revealed high enantiocontrol at the site of addition
with formation of the R enantiomer (e.r. = 94:6).
These results demonstrate that the enzyme 4-OT(M45T/F50A) can indeed
catalyze enantioselective aldol additions.

Having established
that 4-OT(M45T/F50A) has potential for the asymmetric
synthesis of enantioenriched aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes, we
first optimized the reaction conditions by varying the pH and the
concentration of acetaldehyde, buffer, and enzyme (Figure S88). Using the optimized conditions, the one-pot two-step
chemoenzymatic cascade synthesis of aromatic 1,3-diols 5k–n and 5s, via enzymatically prepared
β-hydroxyaldehydes 3k–n and 3s, was achieved with high enantioselectivity (e.r. up to
99:1) and in good isolated yield (63–92%) (Table 1, Figures S48–S62).

(0.125–0.475
mg/mL) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (MOPS for 2k),
with 5% DMSO (v/v) as cosolvent, at pH 8.0 (pH 7.3 for 2s to increase its electrophilicity) and room temperature. The reaction
volume was 40 mL. To reduce the aldehyde functionality of the enzymatic
products 3k–n and 3s, NaBH4 (30 mM) was added to the reaction mixture followed
by incubation for 3 h at room temperature.

f The absolute configuration

To expand
the number of enzymatically accessible β-hydroxyaldehyde
products (e.g., 3b–d, 3f, and 3g) in principle two different approaches can
be used: (i) the use of protein engineering to create new variants
of 4-OT(M45T/F50A) that lack dehydration activity and possess unchanged
or enhanced aldol addition activity or (ii) the use of homologous
enzymes that possess the desired aldol addition activity but lack
dehydration activity. To selectively eliminate the dehydration activity
of 4-OT(M45T/F50A), a structure-based approach is favored, which awaits
the determination of the enzyme crystal structure complexed with one
of the β-hydroxyaldehyde products (work in progress). In this
study, we therefore have chosen to screen a panel of 50 commercially
available 4-OT homologues for enzymes with the desired aldol addition
activity to yield enantioenriched β-hydroxyaldehydes. For initial
activity testing, we used donor substrate 1 and aldol
acceptor substrate 2b. Interestingly, out of the 50 tested
4-OT homologues, three enzymes (TAUT015, TAUT021, and TAUT028) were
found to show significant activity toward the aldol addition of 1 to 2b to give the desired product 3b without promoting significant dehydration leading to formation of 4b (Figure S29). Notably, the same
reaction catalyzed by 4-OT(M45T/F50A) resulted in the formation of
α,β-unsaturated aldehyde 4b as the sole product,
providing additional support that the β-hydroxyaldehyde dehydration
step is enzyme catalyzed.

We next investigated the substrate
scope of the best performing
enzyme, TAUT015, which shows 28% overall sequence identity to 4-OT
(Figure S89), in additions using 1 as donor substrate and a number of selected benzaldehyde
derivatives as potential aldol acceptor substrates. The results show
that, like 4-OT(M45T/F50A), TAUT015 does not accept benzaldehydes
with electron donating substituents (2u, 2v, 2z, 2aa, and 2ab) on the
aromatic ring (Figures S25–S27).
However, several benzaldehydes with electron withdrawing substituents
(2b–d, 2f, and 2g) were well accepted by TAUT015. Encouraged by these findings,
semipreparative scale reactions were carried out under optimized reaction
conditions. The reaction progress (1 with 2b–d, 2f, and 2g) was
monitored by UV–vis spectrophotometry, and the enzymatically
prepared β-hydroxyaldehydes 3b–d, 3f, and 3g were reduced to the corresponding
aromatic 1,3-diols (5b–d, 5f, and 5g) using NaBH4. These one-pot, two-step
chemoenzymatically prepared compounds 5b–d, 5f, and 5g were obtained in good
isolated yields (up to 72%) and with high e.r. values (e.r. up to
>99:1) (Table 2, Figures S63–S87). Note that enzymatic
access to these useful chiral synthons requires the use of TAUT015
as carboligase and is not possible with 4-OT(M45T/F50A). Hence, the
enzyme TAUT015 nicely supplements the toolbox of biocatalysts for
the production of important chiral aromatic β-hydroxyaldehydes
and corresponding 1,3-diols.

a Assay conditions:
acetaldehyde (1, 100 mM), benzaldehyde derivative (2b–d, 2f–g, 2 mM), and enzyme
(crude cell extract, 0.33 mg/mL) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
containing 5% EtOH (v/v) as cosolvent, at pH 6.5 and room temperature.
The specific enzyme activity was determined to be 0.044 U/mg CFE.
Unit definition: 1 U of enzyme converts 1 μmol of 2b in 1 min; assay conditions: 20 mM NaPi pH 6.5, 5% EtOH, 100 mM 1, 2 mM 2b. The reaction volume was 40 mL. To
reduce the aldehyde functionality of 3b–d and 3f–g, NaBH4 (30 mM) was added to the reaction mixture followed by incubation
for 3 h at room temperature.

In conclusion, our results
indicate that members of the 4-OT family
of enzymes, which possess an uncommon catalytic amino-terminal proline,
can function as novel carboligases, promoting the cross-aldol reaction
of acetaldehyde with diverse aromatic aldehydes to give access to
a range of important α,β-unsaturated aldehydes as well
as enantioenriched β-hydroxyaldehydes. It is feasible that their
promiscuous aldol addition activities, which are beyond the synthetic
scope of currently known aldolases, can be further optimized by directed
evolution or computational redesign. It is important to emphasize
that the controlled cross-aldol addition of acetaldehyde is a particularly
challenging synthetic aim because acetaldehyde is a relatively reactive
and difficult to tame chemical.5,7 Remarkably, the promiscuous
4-OT enzymes accept acetaldehyde as a nucleophile in aldol additions,
which is unparalleled among the aldolases, with the notable exception
of 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) and d-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA), which are also able to use
acetaldehyde as a nucleophilic substrate.2g,2k,2o As such, these proline-based 4-OT enzymes
nicely complement the toolbox of biocatalysts for (asymmetric) C–C
bond formation and open up new opportunities to develop practical
enzymatic processes for the more sustainable and step-economic synthesis
of valuable drug precursors starting from simple building blocks.
Further screening of related proline-based enzymes might prove to
be a valuable approach to discover new aldolase activities that could
be exploited to develop synthetically useful biocatalysts for carbon–carbon
bond formation.
