Introduction
With the increased
interest in the electrochemical conversion of
renewable electricity, water, and carbon dioxide to fuels, there is
an ever-growing number of papers reporting new electrocatalysts for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).1−5 The OER is the anode reaction in the electrolysis of water and CO2 and a major source of efficiency loss, because of its high
overpotential.6 To meaningfully compare
the activity of the many new materials that are currently synthesized
and tested, it is important that the research community agrees on
proper standardization, benchmarking, and best practices7,8

Several papers reporting on the activity of OER state that
it is
necessary to saturate the electrolyte with oxygen gas before measurement,
in order for the electrode “to reach its rest potential”
or “to fix the equilibrium potential”,2,9−14 and saturating the solution with oxygen seems to have become an
often-employed practice (see, e.g., refs (15−18)). A recent paper claimed that oxygen in the electrolyte may reduce
the OER activity on nickel (supported on graphene) and change the
Tafel slope via a van der Waals-type interaction of molecular oxygen
with the active site, hampering access by hydroxide ions.11 The argument to fix the equilibrium potential
is based on the idea that, in the absence of oxygen, the driving force
for oxygen evolution should be higher than in its presence. However,
at a given electrode potential, the rate of oxygen evolution itself
must be independent of whether O2 is present in solution
or not. What potentially changes in the presence of oxygen is the
rate of the back reaction, i.e., the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),
and therefore the net production rate of oxygen may
be dependent on whether O2 is present or not. This could
play a role for a reversible reaction near its equilibrium potential,
but it should be irrelevant for an irreversible reaction such as OER
(ORR rates can safely be neglected above 1.3 V). The rate of an electrode
reaction at a given applied potential is more accurately measured
in the absence of the product, regardless of whether, under the experimental
conditions, the equilibrium potential is well-defined or not. This
also implies that the overpotential, when defined as the difference
between the applied potential and the equilibrium potential, is not
well-defined in the absence of oxygen in solution, but this has no
(theoretical) effect on the rate of the OER at a given applied potential.
Of course, close to equilibrium, it may still be necessary to correct
for any current due to the back reaction if one wants to know the
rate of the forward reaction only. The notion that the presence of
O2 in solution may have an effect on the state of the surface
(and thereby influence its chemistry and “rest potential”)
has been studied for platinum electrodes.19,20 It was found that O2 in solution may indeed have an effect
on the activity and stability of platinum electrodes, but apparently
only under potential cycling conditions, or at relatively negative
potentials, suggesting that oxygen reduction may play a role. Kongkanand
and Ziegelbauer concluded that the effect of O2 in solution
on the oxide coverage on platinum is negligible.19

To clarify the experimental role of oxygen saturation
of the electrolyte
on OER activity, we decided to study the effect of electrolyte oxygen
on the OER on Pt and Ni-oxyhydroxide electrodes. In this Viewpoint,
we show that (i) oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte has no significant
effect on the OER activity (at least not on Pt-oxide and Ni-oxyhydroxide
surfaces) and (ii) in the standardization of best practices for OER
studies, care should be taken in employing a proper (placement of
the) reference electrode, and in taking measures that small oxygen
bubbles are efficiently removed from the electrocatalyst surface (for
instance, by rotation).

Experimental Results
Although platinum
is not the best catalyst for the OER, we use
it in this work as a model system to provide insight into the effect
of different parameters. Figure 1 shows the current–potential profiles obtained
during water oxidation catalyzed by polycrystalline Pt at pH 13, with
the electrolyte saturated with O2 (red line) and the electrolyte
obtained by removing oxygen from the solution (black line), under
rotation of the electrode at 1600 rpm and at a scan rate of 1.0 mV
s–1. The onset potential of the OER is ∼1.57
V vs RHE and no significant difference are observed between the O2-saturated solutions and the O2-free solutions.
Under both conditions, the iR-corrected Tafel plots
(see inset in Figure 1) show a similar slope of 170 mV dec–1, in agreement
with the literature.21 The same insensitivity
to O2 saturation was observed in acidic solution (result
not shown).

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammetry for polycrystalline Pt in pH 13 in the region
of oxygen evolution reaction under rotation of the electrode at 1600
rpm. Scan rate = 1.0 mV s–1. Measurements were performed
using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. [Legend: red line denotes electrolyte
saturated with O2; black line denotes electrolyte saturated
with Ar, with no O2 present.]

Figure 2 compares
the effect of the rotation for the same curves showed in Figure 1. There is a clear
effect of the rotation rate of the RDE, comparing OER current–voltage
curves and chronoamperometry measurements with and without rotation
(ω = 1600 and 0 rpm, respectively). Figures 2a and 2b show that,
in the absence of rotation, the onset of OER is delayed, both for
the O2-saturated and O2-free solutions. We ascribe
this observation to the more-efficient removal of oxygen bubbles from
the electrode in the presence of rotation. However, at higher potentials,
the comparison is more difficult to rationalize, because, in the O2-saturated solution, the absence of rotation leads to a higher
current. We note that voltammetric OER rates are generally not perfectly
reproducible when the electrode is not rotated. To add to the complication
of comparing these curves, the effects are dependent on the scan rate.
At 10 mV s–1, we observe no difference between rotation
and no rotation for both electrolytes, whereas, at 50 mV s–1, the OER current is higher in a stagnant O2-free solution
(these data are shown in Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information). To eliminate this effect of scan rate, we
also performed chronoamperometry experiments at a fixed potential
of 1.95 V (vs RHE). Figure 2c compares these experiments for O2-saturated (red
curve) and O2-free solutions (black curve). In the beginning
of the experiment, when both electrodes are rotated, the O2-free solution gives a higher OER current than the O2-saturated
solution. We attribute this observation to the more-facile nucleation
of oxygen bubbles on the platinum electrode in an O2-saturated
solution, thereby blocking the catalytic surface. If rotation is stopped,
the OER activity decreases for both electrolytes, and once rotation
is started again, the activity increases again. This clearly shows
that there is an important effect of rotation, which we tentatively
attribute to the enhanced removal of bubbles in the presence of rotation.
It is also observed that, at longer times, the OER activities in O2-saturated and (initially) O2-free solutions approach
each other.

line represents the absence of O2.]

We note that, in comparing the OER activities in O2-saturated
and O2-free electrolytes, it is important to use an oxygen-insensitive
reference electrode and to keep oxygen rigorously away from the reference
electrode. When performing the experiment using an internal hydrogen
reference electrode, we noted that, in an O2-saturated
solution, the onset potential for OER is substantially lower than
that observed in the absence of oxygen. The reason for this turned
out to be a shift in the potential of the hydrogen reference electrode,
whose potential now becomes a mixed potential that is determined by
hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction. The effect is especially
significant in alkaline media, where the kinetics of the hydrogen
oxidation and hydrogen evolution on platinum are comparatively slow
and, hence, more sensitive to spurious side reactions. In any case,
we recommend using a Hg/HgO or Ag/AgCl reference electrode for OER
experiments in alkaline media, although caution should be taken with
the latter as Cl– ions during long-term measurements
can leach out from the reference electrode compartment and diffuse
to the working electrode, possibly influencing the result of the electrochemical
reaction. Another issue related to the use of the Ag/AgCl reference
electrode in high pH is that Ag2O or AgOH will be formed
and the electrode potential will be that of a mixed Ag/AgCl/Ag2O electrode. In addition, the presence of oxygen in the electrolyte
is expected to enhance the dissolution of a platinum counter electrode.19,20 While this is less of an issue for OER studies on the electrode
materials used in this paper, it is of concern when studying electrocatalytic
reactions on working electrodes sensitive to small amounts of platinum.8

The effect of dissolved oxygen electrolyte
toward OER was also
investigated using an NiOOH-based electrocatalyst, chosen for its
high activity and stability in alkaline media.4,22−24 We performed our measurements in Fe-free electrolyte,
since Boettcher et al.13 have demonstrated
that even unintentional Fe impurities (at the parts per billion (ppb)
level) in the stock electrolyte are sufficient to enhance the performance
of NiOOH.

Figures 3a and 3b show the 10th scan obtained at a
rate of 10.0
mV s–1 in the presence and absence of oxygen in
the solution under rotation (1600 rpm) and under stationary conditions,
respectively, for freshly prepared NiOOH electrocatalysts. Both voltammograms
show the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH (NiII/NiIII) redox transition in the potential region of 1.3–1.4 V vs
RHE. The potential at which this redox transition occurs is not dependent
on the presence of O2 in solution (a Hg/HgO electrode was
used as a reference electrode). However, we note that, when using
an internal RHE as a reference electrode, the redox peak shifted by
ca. 0.1 V to more-negative potential in the presence of oxygen in
the solution (see Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information), because of the above-mentioned problem of the shift
of the reference electrode potential.

Chronoamperometry curves at E = 1.8 V. Scan rate
= 10.0 mV s–1. Measurements were performed using
Hg/HgO reference electrode. [Legend: red line represents the presence
of O2; black line represents the absence of O2.]

An effect of the presence of oxygen
was observed in the potential
region where the oxygen evolution occurs (E >
1.6
V vs RHE). Figures 3a and 3b compare the OER curves in the absence
and presence of oxygen at 1600 and 0 rpm, respectively. The results
show that the OER activity becomes slightly lower by saturating the
solution with O2. The Tafel slopes of the anodic scan for
NiOOH at 1600 rpm (Figure 3c), in the presence and absence of oxygen, show values of
260 and 240 mV dec–1, respectively. For NiOOH, in
the absence of electrode rotation (Figure 3d), the currents are generally lower than
in the presence of rotation (compare Figures 3a and 3b) but the
Tafel slopes are similar. The results show that the highest OER activity
is obtained in an O2-free electrolyte under rotation of
the electrode. The difference with the activity in an O2-saturated electrode in the absence of rotation can be almost a factor
of 2.

Figure 3c displays
the current density versus time curves obtained at 1.8 V vs RHE for
the NiOOH electrocatalyst. The results are similar to those obtained
for polycrystalline Pt (see Figure 2c): an increase in the current density is observed
when the electrode is rotated and when oxygen is removed from the
electrolyte.

It is known that nickel hydroxides can deactivate
during long-term
measurements. In order to ensure optimal activity of the materials,
for each experiment, we performed a new Ni(OH)2 film deposition.
The electrodes were cycled until the cyclic voltammogram was stable.
The results shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information confirm that, without rotation, and in O2-free
electrolyte, the deactivation of NiOOH is faster. When the electrolyte
is saturated with O2, the cyclic voltammograms overlap,
suggesting good stability of the electrocatalyst surface; however,
the curves obtained at rotations of <1600 rpm (Figure S3b in the Supporting Information) and O2-free electrolyte showed a slower decline, indicating good activity
and stability of the electrode under these conditions.

Discussion and Conclusion
The results
presented in the previous section show that the presence
of oxygen in the electrolyte has no (or a negative) effect on the
activity of the oxygen evolution reaction. This exact origin of this
negative effect is not entirely clear and may be due to changes in
the state of the surface or a consequence of the formation of small
bubbles accumulating on the electrode surface.25−28 In principle, the presence of
oxygen in the electrolyte could lead to enhanced bubble formation,
since the critical concentration to reach supersaturation is reached
earlier, although, practically, the critical concentration may be
very much higher than the saturation concentration, such that the
effect may be small.29 Bubbles can be removed
by rotating the electrode or by stirring of the electrolyte when the
electrode cannot be rotated. Comparing our results for Pt and NiOOH
electrodes, the effect seems to be more severe for the NiOOH electrode,
which we tentatively ascribe to the more porous structure of the NiOOH
film.28 Therefore, saturating the electrolyte
with O2 may resemble the conditions in a real electrolyzer
more closely.

In addition, an important secondary issue that
must be considered
during OER measurements is related to the use of the reference electrode.
In the presence of oxygen, one must take care to avoid having a mixed
reference potential, and confirm the oxygen insensitivity of the reference
electrode used.

Experimental Section
Experimental Conditions,
Electrodes, and Reactants
Electrochemical measurements were
performed at room temperature (20
± 1 °C) with an Autolab PGSTAT12 system, using a single-compartment
three-electrode cell thatw as composed of fluorinated ethylene propylene
(FEP). The cell and all glassware used were rigorously cleaned before
starting the experiments by storing overnight in concentrated H2SO4 to remove metals and organic contaminants.
Before use, it was rinsed and boiled five times in water to ensure
the cleanness of the system. All water used for cleaning and preparing
electrolyte solutions was demineralized and ultrafiltered by a Millipore
Milli-Q system (resistivity of >18.2 MΩ, TOC < 5 ppb).

The chemicals used in this work were of ultrahigh purity: Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich trace metal basis,
99.999%), H2SO4 (Aldrich, 98%), and NaOH (Aldrich,
30% solution in H2O, TraceSelect for trace analysis).

For the OER measurements, high-area Pt and Au counter electrodes
were used (the latter for measurements using NiOOH as a catalyst).
A commercial and self-contained RHE (Gaskatel, Hydroflex), consisting
of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a silver–silver chloride
(Ag/AgCl), and a mercury–mercury oxide (Hg/HgO), was used as
a reference electrode.

The working
electrodes were a polycrystalline Pt rotating disk
electrode, or a Ni film deposited on Au rotating-disk electrode (RDE)
(ϕ = 0.196 cm2). Before measurements, the RDE electrode
was first polished with 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina paste (Buehler,
Ltd.). Subsequently, the electrode was sonicated for 5 min to remove
polishing particles. All experiments were performed at 0 or 1600 rpm
(unless otherwise stated).

Nickel was plated on the polycrystalline
gold electrode by galvanostatic
electrodeposition from 5 mM Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution, using 0.1 M NaClO4 as a supporting
electrolyte. The deposition was carried out by applying a cathodic
current (50 μA) for a given time, in order to obtain ca. five
monolayers of coverage; the time for nickel plating was calculated
according to the real surface area of the working electrode in order
to deposit 5 × 726 μC cm–2, with the
latter value corresponding to the charge needed to deposit one monolayer
of closely packed metallic nickel from a NiII solution,
assuming the atomic radius of Ni to be 0.124 nm and a density of 8.908
g cm–3.30

All potentials in this
work are reported versus the RHE. The potentials
were converted to the RHE scale, according to eq 1: 1  where ERHE is the potential on the RHE scale and E is the experimental potential measured with respect to the reference
electrode potential (Eref).

For
measurements in rigorously Fe-free NaOH electrolytes, we used
a method reported by Boettcher et al.,13 using a high-purity Ni(OH)2 precipitate as an Fe absorbent
to remove trace Fe from the NaOH electrolyte. Briefly, it consists
of dissolving 99.999% pure Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in ultrapure water in a polypropylene tube. Next, 1.0 M
NaOH was added to precipitate high-purity Ni(OH)2. The
mixture was shaken and centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted.
The Ni(OH)2 was washed three times by adding water and
1.0 M NaOH, redispersing the solid, centrifuging and decanting the
supernatant. Finally, the tube was filled with 1.0 M NaOH for purification.
The solid was redispersed and mechanically agitated for at least 10
min, followed by at least 3 h of resting. The mixture was centrifuged,
and the purified NaOH supernatant was decanted into a polypropylene
bottle for storage, and later used for the electrochemical experiments.

Prior to the electrochemical measurements, the working solution
was deaerated with argon for 30 min and the cyclic voltammograms were
collected at different scan rates (1.0, 10.0, and 50.0 mV s–1) with and without rotation. Afterward, the electrolyte was saturated
with O2 during 30 min and the same measurements were performed.
