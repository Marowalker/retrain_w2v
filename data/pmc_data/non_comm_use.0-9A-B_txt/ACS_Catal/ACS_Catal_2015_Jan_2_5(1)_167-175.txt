We
report herein a palladium-catalyzed C–H arylation of
quinoline N-oxides that proceeds with high selectivity
in favor of the C8 isomer. This site selectivity is unusual for palladium,
since all of the hitherto described methods of palladium-catalyzed
C–H functionalization of quinoline N-oxides
are highly C2 selective. The reaction exhibits a broad synthetic scope
with respect to quinoline N-oxides and iodoarenes
and can be significantly accelerated to subhour reaction times under
microwave irradiation. The C8-arylation method can be carried out
on a gram scale and has excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic
and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies provide
evidence for the cyclopalladation pathway and describe key parameters
influencing the site selectivity.

Introduction
Transition-metal-catalyzed
C–H
functionalization has emerged
as powerful general strategy for the synthesis of complex synthetic
targets.1 Due to the abundance of C–H
bonds in organic molecules, one of the key challenges in this area
of catalysis is to gain an understanding of the factors that govern
the regioselectivity of competing C–H functionalization pathways.2 Two strategies have been used to achieve the
desired control over regioselectivity. While the first strategy is
based on the use of directing groups, the second strategy exploits
the inherent steric and electronic biases imposed by substrate functional
groups.3 Advantageously, directing groups
can be tailored to guide the catalyst to specific C–H bonds
within the substrate.4 However, they have
to be installed and then removed from the product, thus potentially
reducing their synthetic utility. This shortcoming can be attenuated
if the directing groups are converted into other desired functional
groups of the synthetic target after the C–H functionalization
step.

8-Substituted quinolines are important structural motifs
with applications
in the areas of drug discovery,5 materials
science,6 and catalysis.7 A significant number of methods exist for catalytic functionalization
of unsubstituted quinolines in the C2 position with Pd,8,9 Cu,10 Ni,11 Rh,12 Ru,13 and Ag14 as catalysts.

In contrast,
very few methods are known for functionalization of
the C8 position in the quinoline (Figure 1).
In a pioneering study, Chang developed a direct arylation of quinolines
in the C8 position catalyzed by a dirhodium NHC complex.15 Shibata recently reported on the cationic Rh-catalyzed
C8 alkenylation of quinoline N-oxides,16 while an Ir-catalyzed C8 borylation reaction
was developed by Steel, Marder, and Sawamura.17 Recently, Chang utilized an Ir-based catalyst for C8 amidation with
sulfonyl azides and a Rh-based catalyst for a C8-selective iodination
of quinoline N-oxides.18 In addition, an example of Rh-catalyzed C–C/C–O coupling
with alkynes in the C8 position of quinoline N-oxides
was disclosed by Li,19 and Rh-catalyzed
C8 alkynylation and alkylation with α-diazo esters were reported
by Chang.20

Figure 1 Current approaches to
C2- and C8-selective C–H functionalization
of quinolines.

Since the first report
by Fagnou, azine N-oxides
have been employed as substrates for a variety of highly C2 selective
C–H functionalizations.9 The original
method developed by Fagnou relied on the use of palladium complexes
with sterically demanding phosphines (e.g., di-tert-butylphenylphosphine and tri-tert-butylphosphine)
as catalysts. Initial mechanistic investigations supported the inner-sphere
concerted metalation–deprotonation (CMD) pathway that did not
involve precoordination of the N-oxide oxygen atom
to palladium.9h On the other hand, a recent
study by Hartwig provided strong evidence that the cyclometalated
complex [Pd(OAc)(tBu2PCMe2CH2)] is initially formed, when tri-tert-butylphosphine
is used as a ligand.21 This complex subsequently
serves as a catalyst for the arylation of pyridine N-oxide. Intriguingly, in none of the examples of the Pd-catalyzed
C–H functionalization of quinoline N-oxides
was any C8-functionalization product reported, even as a minor isomer.
This is surprising, considering the proximity and the parallel alignment
of the C8–H bond and the N–O bond that can potentially
guide palladium in the C8 position. Although the origins of the C2
selectivity for quinoline N-oxides have not been
studied, in the case of pyridine N-oxides the high
C2 preference of palladium was explained by the increased acidity22 and the increased strength23 of the C2–H bond effected by the adjacent electron-withdrawing
N–O group. This report outlines the development of the palladium-catalyzed
C8-selective arylation of quinoline N-oxides, as
well as the mechanistic details pertaining to the divergent site selectivity
of the palladium/quinoline N-oxide couple and the
crucial roles of additives and solvents.

Results and Discussion
Initial
Studies
Quinoline N-oxide
was selected to study the site selectivity of Pd-catalyzed arylation
under ligand-free conditions. Interestingly, the Pd-catalyzed C2–H
arylation reactions of quinoline N-oxides described
to date have typically been carried out either with phosphine-bound
palladium catalysts or under phosphine-free conditions24 in neutral solvents (e.g., DMF and dioxane).
Addition of substoichiometric amounts of pivalic or acetic acids was
found to improve the yields but had no effect on the site selectivity.
On the other hand, recent studies point toward an important role of
polar acidic solvents in the acceleration of cyclopalladation processes.25 Thus, the influence of acetic acid as a solvent
(Table 1) was investigated first. The reaction
proceeds with a high C8 selectivity (12:1 C8/C2 ratio) and in ∼9%
yield with 5 mol % of Pd(OAc)2. Addition of silver acetate
improved the conversion without affecting the C8/C2 ratio (entry 2).
The crucial role of acetic acid became evident when it was replaced
with dimethylformamide and tert-butyl alcohol (entries
3 and 4): in both cases the C2-aryl isomer 3 was formed
as a predominant product (1:7 and 1:6 C8/C2 ratios, respectively).
Other palladium salts (entries 5 and 6) caused undesired side reactions,
as can be seen from the lower recovery of unreacted substrate 1. A survey of silver salts showed that the carbonate is less
effective than the acetate. On the other hand, phosphate dramatically
improved the C8/C2 ratio and the conversion (entry 8). A reaction
carried out with 0.5 equiv of silver phosphate proceeded with >30:1
C8/C2 ratio and a 73% conversion to 2. Further improvement
was achieved using 30 equiv of acetic acid (entry 9). In this case
the C8/C2 ratio was >30:1, and the yield improved to 78%. Water
had
a notable accelerating effect (entry 10), leading to a clean reaction
and nearly complete conversion, while providing a high C8/C2 ratio
of 23:1. The reaction also proved to give excellent results when carried
out under microwave irradiation26 at 180
°C (entries 11 and 12). A comparable conversion and C8/C2 ratio
were obtained within 45 min with 5.5 equiv of water, and 65% yield
was obtained within 10 min with 40 equiv of water. Aryl iodides proved
to be significantly more reactive than bromides, while no reaction
was observed with chlorides.27 This pattern
of reactivity indicates that bromo and chloro groups can be compatible
with the conditions of the C8 arylation method.

a Yields were determined by 1H NMR analysis with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene
as an internal standard
added prior to workup. Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), 4 (3 equiv), with the catalyst and the additives under Ar
for 12 h at 120 °C.

b Reaction was run under microwave
irradiation at 180 °C for 45 min.

c Reaction was run under microwave
irradiation at 180 °C for 10 min.

Synthetic Scope
The reaction tolerates a number of
functional groups in the quinoline system under the optimized conditions
using conventional heat and microwave irradiation (Table 2). Methyl ester, methoxy, nitro, and bromo substituents
have been found to be compatible with the C8-selective catalytic system.
Similarly, iodoarenes bearing fluoro, bromo, chloro, trifluoromethyl,
trifluoromethoxy, and methoxy groups afforded the corresponding 8-arylquinoline N-oxides in good to excellent yields. The C8-substitution
pattern was confirmed by means of NMR spectroscopy and, in the case
of product 2, by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.
Thermal and microwave conditions were found to provide C8-arylated
products in comparable yields with the advantage of significant reduction
of reaction time in the latter case. The microwave-assisted reactions
were generally complete within 1 h at 180 °C. The C8/C2 ratio
was >20:1 in most of the cases, and simple purification by flash
chromatography
afforded pure C8 isomer. The reaction proceeded more slowly with N-oxides bearing electron-withdrawing groups in the C6 position
(e.g., nitro and ester groups), resulting in somewhat lower yields
of the corresponding products. 2-Substituted quinoline N-oxides reacted cleanly and afforded 8-arylated derivatives as the
sole products. Gratifyingly, no α-arylation at the methyl group
was observed in the case of 2-methylquinoline N-oxide.
The reaction is amenable to gram-scale operations. For example, the
synthesis of 8-phenylquinoline N-oxide (5) was successfully carried out with 2.1 g of 1 and afforded
2.6 g of 5 (82% yield).

Table 2 Scope of
the C8–H Arylation
of Quinoline N-Oxides with Iodoarenes under Thermal
(T) and Microwave (MW) Conditionsa
a The reactions were carried out with
0.5–1 mmol of the substrate for 16 h (T) or 50 min (MW). The
yields are reported for isolated 8-arylquinoline N-oxides. The C8/C2 ratios are reported in brackets for the crude
product before chromatographic purification.

b 5.5 equiv H2O was used.

In order to bypass the isolation
steps en route to 8-arylquinolines,
a practical one-pot protocol for the synthesis of 8-arylquinolines
from quinoline under microwave irradiation was developed (Figure 2). N-oxidation of quinoline with hydrogen peroxide
in the presence of acetic acid for 40 min at 180 °C was followed
by the Pd-catalyzed C8 arylation with 4-bromoiodobenzene.

Figure 2 8-Arylquinoline
synthesis by a tandem microwave-accelerated procedure.

Subsequent reduction of the N–O bond by
hypophosphorous
acid at 120 °C afforded 8-(4-bromophenyl)quinoline (26) in a 67% yield from quinoline. Due to significant acceleration
of each of the three reactions under microwave irradiation, the one-pot
procedure can be completed within 3 h. Heterocyclic N-oxides are synthetically versatile intermediates, due to their ease
of preparation28 and the variety of methods
that can be used to convert the N-oxide moiety into
a number of other functional groups, in particular in the C2 position.29,30 For example, treatment of N-oxide 9 with tert-butylamine and p-toluenesulfonic
anhydride31 gave rise to 2-N-tert-butylaminoquinoline (27) in 70%
yield (Figure 3). Similarly, a reaction32 with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride
and methanol afforded 2-methoxy-8-phenylquinoline (28) in 83% yield. 2-Quinolone 29 was readily prepared
by a trifluoroacetic anhydride mediated rearrangement33 of 5 in 92% yield.

products (TFAA = trifluoroacetic
anhydride).

Further, the N–O
moiety was used to install a trifluoromethyl
group in the C2 position by means of a base-mediated reaction34 with the Ruppert–Prakash reagent. A regioselective
conversion of 8-aryl-substituted quinoline N-oxides
to the corresponding 2-chloroquinolines 30–32 was accomplished by a reaction with thionyl chloride in
68–72% yields. Copper-catalyzed deoxygenative C2 arylation
and alkylation10e of the N-oxide products was also effected by Grignard reagents in the presence
of magnesium chloride. In addition, a reaction of the 8-arylquinaldine N-oxide 16 with acetic anhydride led to clean
transposition of the oxy functionality to the α-carbon and afforded
α-acetoxy-substituted quinaldine 33 in 94% yield.

Mechanistic Studies
The speciation of palladium(II)
acetate in solution strongly depends on the solvent, temperature,
and presence of water. Facile partial hydrolysis of the trimer in
organic solvents in the presence of water was observed by Cotton and
Murillo.35

Kinetic studies by Vargaftik36 and Hii37 showed
that water promotes dissociation of the cyclotrimer, and linear trimeric
and monomeric species were suggested as intermediates in aqueous acetic
acid and tetrahydrofuran. While the cyclic trimeric structure Pd3(OAc)6 is largely retained in chloroform, benzene,
methanol, and acetic acid at room temperature, linear trimers and
monomeric species have also been detected in chloroform–acetic
acid and in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP),38 respectively. We examined the influence of water
on the C8 arylation under increasing dilution and constant-volume
conditions. In the first case addition of water leads to acceleration
of the reaction even as the concentration of the reagents decreases
at high water loadings.39 A conversion
of 74% is reached with 40 equiv of water but remains nearly constant
as the amount of added water increases. Since the reaction rates can
be influenced by changes in the concentrations due to dilution, a
second set of experiments was carried out in the acetic acid–water
system by varying the water content and keeping the reaction volume
constant.40 The rate acceleration is observed
in this case as well; however, a maximum is achieved at ∼40%
water. The reaction rate then decreases as water becomes the major
component of the mixture, presumably due to the decreasing solubility
of the reactants in the predominantly aqueous solutions. The accelerating
effect of water that is especially strong at lower water concentrations
may be due to the faster dissociation of the oligomeric species of
palladium acetate to the more reactive acyclic and monomeric forms.
In addition, N-oxide complexes of palladium, although
stable under anhydrous conditions, are labile in the presence of water;41 hence, water may facilitate the turnover of
the palladium catalyst.

Several functional group guided Pd-catalyzed
C–H arylation
reactions have previously been shown to require acidic solvents (AcOH
or TFA), and a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle has been implicated.42 While the role of the acidic solvents has not
been studied in detail, it is conceivable that the current system
proceeds by a similar mechanistic pathway.

We further examined
the behavior of the present catalytic system
in deuterated solvents (Figure 4).

Figure 4 H/D exchange
in C2 and C8 positions of recovered unreacted N-oxide 1 and product 2.

Preliminary experiments showed that no H/D exchange occurred
in
the absence of palladium acetate in CD3COOD/D2O at 120 °C in 3 h with and without silver phosphate present.
Conversely, a reversible H/D exchange in the C8 position was observed
in the presence of palladium acetate (5 mol %). No deuterium incorporation
was detected in the C2 position of quinoline N-oxide.
Next, the C8-arylation reaction was carried out in CD3COOD/D2O, and the extent of the H/D exchange was determined for the
recovered unreacted quinoline N-oxide and the product 2. While no deuterium incorporation was observed at the C2
position of both the recovered substrate 1 and the arylation
product 2, 39% deuteration was detected in the C8 position
of the recovered N-oxide 1.

These
results indicate that a palladacycle, e.g. as represented
by structure 39 or a (hetero)dimeric analogue, can be
formed reversibly under the reaction conditions by an N–O group
guided activation of the C8–H bond. Attempts at observing palladacycle 39 (or any structural or (hetero)dimeric analogue) by means
of NMR at temperatures below 100 °C or isolating it were not
successful.43 These results suggest that
the putative palladacycle is kinetically labile under the reaction
conditions and that the protodepalladation is very fast. This behavior
is in line with the aforementioned lability of palladium(II) complexes
of N-oxides in the presence of water. The H/D exchange
does not take place at temperatures below 100 °C.

The C2-H/D
exchange is promoted by base under aqueous conditions.10c Although acetic acid may prevent the base-mediated
C2 metalation by protonating the base, the C8 selectivity of C–H
activation in acetic acid cannot be explained by this effect. Experiments
with Pd salts show that the rate of C2–H/D exchange (10 mol
% PdX2, 1 in AcOH at 120 °C, 3 h) increases
with less basic anions (Pd(OAc)2 C8–D 39%, C2–D
<1%; Pd(O2CCF3)2 C8–D 93%,
C2–D 25%; Pd(CH3CN)4(OTf)2 C8–D 94%, C2–D 13%), pointing to the electrophilic
character of the C–H activation. Similarly, the rate of C2–H/D
exchange catalyzed by Ag salts (10 mol % of AgX, 1 in
AcOH at 120 °C, 3 h), increases in the following order: OAc (26%
C2–D) < OTf (30% C2–D) < SbF6 (59%
C2–D), with no appreciable C8–H/D exchange. These results
indicate that the C2– and C8–H activation processes
in acetic acid are primarily electrophilic and the C8/C2 selectivity
is determined by the nature of the metal and the solvent. The crucial
role of acetic acid is further supported by the results of the H/D-exchange
experiments in DMF (10 mol % of PdX2, DMF, 5.5 equiv of
D2O, 120 °C, 3 h). In this case, a much slower and
nonregioselective C2/C8–H activation was observed for Pd(OAc)2 (C8–D 8%, C2–D 17%) and Pd(O2CCF3)2 (C8–D 13%, C2–D 14%).

Kinetic
isotope experiments have become a useful tool for mechanistic
studies of C–H functionalization processes.44 Toward this end, the primary kinetic isotope effect for
the C8 arylation of quinoline oxide was determined in an parallel
competition experiment with 1 and 2,8-d2-1 in CH3CO2H/H2O and CD3CO2D/D2O, respectively,
to exclude the influence of the H/D exchange (eq 1). The observed KIE (kH/kD = 2.0) indicated that C8–H bond cleavage may
be involved in the turnover-determining step or precede it. 1  

We next investigated the electronic effect of substituents
in the
5- and 6-positions of quinoline N-oxide on the rate
of the H/D exchange and the rate of the arylation (Figure 5). The Hammett plots indicate that both reactions
are accelerated by electron-donating substituents in the 5- and 6-positions
of the quinoline system. A large negative ρ value for the H/D
exchange (ρ = −2.98) is indicative of considerable cationic
character in the transition state of the C–H bond activation
step and points to a significant electrophilic character of the reacting
palladium catalyst.

Figure 5 Hammett plots for the C8–H arylation of substituted
quinoline N-oxides (green line) and for the H/D exchange
(blue line).

The ρ value for
the C–H arylation was also large and
negative, suggesting that the palladacycle formation is an important
contributor to the overall kinetics of the reaction, further supporting
the results of the kinetic isotope effect experiments. For comparison,
a positive ρ value (+1.53) was obtained for the Pd/tBu3P-catalyzed C2-arylation of pyridine N-oxides,9h which was interpreted as an
indication of a buildup of the negative charge in the TS along the
CMD pathway and is in line with the electron-rich nature of the phosphine-bound
Pd catalyst.

The influence of substituents in the iodoarene
on the rate of the
C8–H arylation was also investigated (Figure 6). The Hammett analysis suggests that the reaction is accelerated
by electron-withdrawing substituents in the iodoarene.

Figure 6 Hammett plot for the
C8–H arylation with substituted iodoarenes.

The ρ value (+0.29) is substantially smaller
than Hammett
reaction constants observed for oxidative additions to Pd. For example,
ρ values for rate-determining oxidative additions to Pd0 are typically within the range of +0.6 to +2.5 for iodoarenes,45 while Sanford reported ρ = +1.7 for the
rate-limiting oxidative addition to PdII for the direct
C–H arylation with diaryliodonium salts.46 Substantially smaller ρ values have been interpreted
as an indication that the oxidative addition is not a turnover-limiting
step.47 Further, it was found that the
rate of conversion of 1 to 2 after 3 h at
120 °C is independent of the concentration of iodoarene 4 within the 0.5–2.5 equiv range of 4.
Furthermore, no reaction was observed when Pd2(dba)3 and PhPd(tmeda)I were used as catalysts, indicating that
cyclopalladation likely precedes oxidative addition. Together with
the data of the Hammett study of electronic effects of substituents
in the quinoline core and kinetic isotope effect data, these results
point to C8 cyclopalladation as a turnover-limiting step in the catalytic
cycle.

Computational Studies
In an effort to explain the C8
selectivity of the arylation reaction, we have examined several mechanistic
scenarios for the palladium-catalyzed C–H cleavage by means
of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and compared the C8-
and C2-metalation pathways. In particular, we focused on (i) the role
of acetic acid as a noninnocent solvent in the catalytic process and
(ii) the disparity in the site selectivity of metalation between palladium
acetate and the phosphine-bound Pd metal center. Previous experimental
and computational studies31,48 have shown that the
mechanisms involving Pd(OAc)2, Pd(OAc)(HOAc), and Pd(HOAc)3 as the active palladium species can be operative, when acetic
acid is used as a solvent. We also studied the C–H activation
of quinoline N-oxide by Pd(PMe3)Ph, as
this species shows exclusive C–H activation at the C2 position.
Hence, the following four mechanistic scenarios were investigated.

In mechanism 1a (Figure 7), cyclometalation
is effected by a dicationic Pd metal center with three acetic acid
ligands, whereas mechanisms 1b (Figure 8) and
1c (Figure 9) describe cyclopalladation by
monocationic and neutral Pd metal centers, respectively. Mechanism
2 (Figure 10) describes metalation by the phosphine-bound
Pd center in a fashion similar to what has been proposed for pyridine N-oxides.9h Acetic acid complexes
of palladium similar to those examined in mechanisms 1a–c were
implicated in the acid-assisted C–H bond activation by Pd in
oxazolone ligands in neat acetic acid solutions.49 All of the C–H bond cleavage transition states connect
the C–H bond cleavage products to starting structures, in which
quinoline N-oxide coordinates to palladium through
its oxygen atom.9d

transition states, and products in mechanism 2.

In mechanism 1a, the initial formation of the dicationic
[Pd(HOAc)3(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide)]2+ complex containing three
ligated
acetic acid molecules was considered due to the high acetic acid concentration.25,50 In mechanisms 1b and 1c, the initial formation of monocationic [Pd(κ2-OAc)(HOAc)(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide)]+ complex, with only one
of the acetate ligands being protonated, and the neutral [Pd(κ2-OAc)(HOAc)(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide)] complex was considered, respectively.
In mechanism 2, the reaction of quinoline N-oxide
with (Ph)(PMe3)Pd(κ2-OAc) starting complex
was examined for the purpose of comparing the regioselectivity of
C–H activation of quinoline N-oxide with those
of other N-heteroarene substrates widely studied experimentally and
computationally.9h,23,51

Solvation Gibbs free energies were calculated for the relevant
intermediates, transition states, and products involved in mechanisms
1a–c relative to each of the most stable Pd(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide) starting
complexes. In mechanism 1a (Figure 7), the
transition state structure for the C–H bond activation of the
quinoline N-oxide at the C8 position, TS8M1a, connects the C–H bond activation
product, P8M1a, to a shallow
intermediate, I8M1a, having an
agostic C–H interaction with the palladium center. This intermediate
is only 2.8 kcal/mol lower in energy than TS8M1a and 21.9 kcal/mol higher in energy than the [Pd(HOAc)3(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide)]2+ starting complex, S8M1a. Formation of an agostic C–H intermediate
followed by proton abstraction by an acetic acid molecule is consistent
with the reported mechanism for the C–H activation reactions
of oxazolone.48 In contrast, the C2–H
activation pathway does not involve such an intermediate.

The
transition state, TS2M1a, connects
the [Pd(HOAc)3(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide)]2+ starting complex, S2M1a, directly to the C–H
bond activation product, P2M1a, via a CMD pathway, in which the Pd–C bond formation occurs
concurrently with the cleavage of the C–H bond. The 15.7 kcal/mol
energy difference between the transition states TS2M1a and TS8M1a results from the formation of a four-membered palladacycle in the
case of C2–H activation versus a more stable five-membered
palladacycle in the C8–H activation.52

Both C2–H and C8–H activation pathways proceed
through
the dissociation of one of the three acetic acid molecules coordinated
to the palladium center in S2M1a and S8M1a followed by an outer-sphere
metalation and deprotonation by the external acetic acid molecule.

The free energy diagram for mechanism 1b (Figure 8) is similar to that of mechanism 1a. The C2–H activation
pathway proceeds through the six-membered inner-sphere CMD transition
state structure TS2M1b, where
the acetate ligand accepts the hydrogen with simultaneous formation
of a Pd–C bond to generate the palladium aryl species P2M1b.

The C8–H activation
pathway proceeds through the formation
of the agostic C–H intermediate I8M1b followed by proton abstraction by the acetate ligand to give P8M1b. The transition state TS8M1b is 9.0 kcal/mol lower in energy
than TS2M1b.

In mechanism
1c (Figure 9), both C2–H
and C8–H activation reactions proceed through an inner-sphere
CMD pathway. Both C–H activation products P2M1c and P8M1c are more stable than the starting palladium complexes S2M1c and S8M1c. C–H activation product P8M1c is 12.1 kcal/mol lower in energy than S8M1c.

The experimentally observed reversibility
of the C–H activation
step and the short lifetime of the C–H activation products
indicate that the C–H activation products have higher energies
in comparison to the starting structures leading to their formation.
Among the three mechanistic scenarios investigated, mechanism 1a is
the most plausible on the basis of the endothermicity of the C–H
bond cleavage step. Natural bond order (NBO)53 atomic charge analysis was also conducted to determine the atomic
charges on the Pd and carbon atoms involved in the C–H activation
step in mechanisms 1a–c (see Table S7, Supporting Information). In all three mechanisms, the C8 atom was
found to be more electron rich than the C2 atom (−0.443 vs
−0.204 in mechanism 1a, −0.383 vs −0.12 in mechanism
1b, and −0.350 vs −0.084 in mechanism 1c), while the
charge on Pd was around 0.6 in all cases. These results indicate that
the preference of the electrophilic Pd2+ center for the
C8–H bond can be ascribed to the greater nucleophilicity of
C8 in comparison to that of C2. All three of the mechanisms discussed
above are consistent with the experimentally observed regioselectivity
of the C–H bond activation reactions of quinoline N-oxide at the C8 position.

Solvation Gibbs free energies of
the relevant intermediates, transition
states, and products involved in mechanism 2 relative to the total
solvation Gibbs free energies of (Ph)(PMe3)Pd(κ2-OAc) and quinoline N-oxide are shown in
Figure 10. The trans geometry between the phenyl
group and the acetate ligand has been found to have a lower energy
than the cis isomer.50 The previously reported
optimized transition state structure for the C2–H bond activation
of pyridine N-oxide was used as an initial estimate
for both C2–H and C8–H bond cleavage transition states
of quinoline N-oxide.

The transition state
structure TS8M2 connects the
(Ph)(PMe3)Pd(κ1-OAc)(κ1-Oquinoline N-oxide) starting
complex, S8M2, directly
to the C–H bond activation product, P8M2, via a CMD pathway. In the C2–H activation
pathway, the transition state structure TS2M2 connects the C–H bond activation product, P2M2, to a Pd η2 π-complex
intermediate, S2M2. With this
structure as a starting point, a stepwise decrease of the interatomic
distance between the quinoline N-oxide oxygen and
palladium metal center resulted in the dissociation of quinoline N-oxide and formation of the palladium κ2-bound acetate intermediate, (PMe3)(Ph)Pd(κ-acetate),
prior to the formation of the palladium κ1-bound
quinoline N-oxide intermediate. Transition state TS2M2 is 14.9 kcal/mol lower in energy
than transition state TS8M2.
The C2–H bond activation product, P2M2, is 6.7 kcal/mol lower in energy than P8M2. These results are in agreement with the
kinetic–thermodynamic connection: a thermodynamically more
stable C–H bond activation product results from the lowest
energy transition state.23 In summary,
the detailed DFT calculations accurately predict the observed regioselectivity
of the C–H bond activation reactions of quinoline N-oxide at the C8 position with palladium acetate in acetic acid solution.
This can be explained on the basis of the relative stabilities of
the five- and four-membered palladacycles formed from the C–H
bond activation of quinoline N-oxide at the C8 and
C2 positions, respectively, and by the higher nucleophilicity of the
C8 position. The role of acetic acid solvent was evaluated by considering
its coordination to the palladium metal center. All of the mechanistic
pathways for the C–H bond cleavage step at the C2 position
proceed through a CMD pathway. For the activation at the C8 position,
mechanisms 1a and 1b proceed through an agostic C–H intermediate,
while mechanisms 1c and 2 proceed through a CMD pathway. Computational
studies on the complete catalytic cycle are currently underway and
will be reported separately.

Conclusions
In
summary, this paper describes synthetic, mechanistic, and computational
studies of the palladium-catalyzed regioselective C8 arylation of
quinoline N-oxides. The current method tolerates
a number of functional groups in quinolines and iodoarenes and can
be carried out under thermal or microwave conditions on a gram scale.
Mechanistic studies indicate the key role of the C–H bond cleavage
step. Computational studies by means of DFT point to the C8 cyclopalladation
as the lower energy pathway under phosphine-free conditions with acetic
acid as a noninnocent solvent/ligand and explain the reversal of site
selectivity to C2 with phosphine-bound Pd.
