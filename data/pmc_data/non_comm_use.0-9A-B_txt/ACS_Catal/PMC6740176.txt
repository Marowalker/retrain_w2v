Ionic
liquids (ILs) modification, following the concept of “solid
catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL)”, has been demonstrated
to be an effective approach to improving both activity and stability
of Pt-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. In this work,
the SCILL concept has been applied to a trimetallic PtNiMo/C system,
which has been documented recently to be significantly advantageous
over the benchmark PtNi-based catalysts for oxygen reduction. To achieve
this, two hydrophobic ILs ([BMIM][NTF2] and [MTBD][BETI]) were used
to modify PtNiMo/C with four IL-loading amounts between 7 and 38 wt
%. We found that the Pt mass activity (@0.9 V) could be improved by
up to 50% with [BMIM][NTF2] and even 70% when [MTBD][BETI] is used.
Exceeding a specific IL loading amount, however, leads to a mass transport
related activity drop. Moreover, it is also disclosed that both ILs
can effectively suppress the formation of nonreactive oxygenated species,
while at the same time imposing little effect on the electrochemical
active surface area. For a deeper understanding of the degradation
mechanism of pristine and IL modified PtNiMo/C, we applied identical
location transmission electron microscopy and in situ scanning flow cell coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
techniques. It is disclosed that the presence of ILs has selectively
accelerated the dissolution of Mo and eventually results in a more
severe degradation of PtNiMo/C. This shows that future research needs
to identify ILs that prevent the Mo dissolution to leverage the potential
of the IL modification of PtNiMo catalysts.

1 Introduction
Low-temperature fuel cells
(LTFCs) are gaining increasing attention
in both the public and science community as they offer a promising
option in the future clean energy scenario with particularly important
applications in the automotive sector.1−3 Carbon supported Pt-based
nanoparticles still represent the state-of-the-art catalyst for both
the anodic hydrogen oxidation and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) in LTFCs. However, high Pt loadings are required to accelerate
the sluggish ORR at the cathode, and these along with the resultant
high cost of electrode catalysts (accounting for up to 55% of the
total cost of a LTFC) greatly impede the market-penetration of LTFC
technology.4−7 Intensive efforts have been devoted to minimize the usage of expensive
Pt by developing innovative catalysts with superior activity.8 Alloying Pt with other base metals (e.g., Fe,
Co, Ni) has been undoubtedly the most efficient strategy so far for
this purpose. Specifically, PtNi alloyed nanoparticles terminated
with (111) facets are probably the most studied systems since the
benchmark work of Stamenkovic et al., who reported 2 orders of magnitude
higher ORR activity (vs Pt/C) obtained on an alloyed Pt3Ni(111) model catalyst.9−11 Despite the great promise and
numerous successes in attaining remarkably high ORR activity over
PtNi-based catalysts, their durability performance is still far from
satisfying because of the preferred leaching of Ni and associated
surface restructuring under voltage cycling conditions,12,13 which is induced by frequent start/stop events and load variations
of LTFC devices.14−16 In view of this, many attempts have been made to
suppress the degradation of PtNi catalysts without compromising their
high initial activity. Among other options, incorporation of a third
metal could achieve the desired stabilizing effect combined with a
high ORR activity and can be seen as a game changer in the field.
Henceforth, doping PtNi with various transition metals such as Cu,17 Fe,18 Rh,12 Co,19−21 or Mo22−24 has become
the favored strategy for preventing Ni dissolution. Especially Mo-doped
PtNi could stand out from various PtNiM-alloys, by exhibiting not
only an improved voltage-cycling stability but also an exceptionally
high ORR activity (7 A mgPt–1, @0.90
V).23 The presence of Mo in PtNi catalysts
could take effect to keep the shape and surface composition of PtNi
nanoparticles by stabilizing under-coordinated Pt sites and increasing
the concentration of subsurface Ni atoms.22,24

Surface modification with a subtle amount of hydrophobic ionic
liquid (IL) has recently emerged as another efficient approach to
enhancing the performance of Pt catalysts toward ORR.25−28 This method was initiated in 2007 in the heterogeneous catalysis
community, by reporting that the reaction selectivity of Ni catalyzed
sequential hydrogenation of diene was dramatically altered after coating
the catalyst with IL.29 Thereafter the
term of “solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL)”
was coined for such a concept.29 In 2010,
Erlebacher et al. reported that the similar SCILL concept could be
applied to an electrocatalyst, and they found that the ORR activity
of porous PtNi was improved by 2 to 3 times after IL modification.25 We have also demonstrated that modifying a conventional
Pt/C catalyst using a hydrophobic IL [MTBD][NTF2] can efficiently
boost the activity for ORR, and the boosting effect is highly sensitive
to the IL filling degrees in the pores of the catalysts.27 The stabilizing effect of IL ([MTBD][NTF2])
was also disclosed within this work, which was attributed to the electrostatic
protection effect and suppressed carbon corrosion.27 More recently, we disclosed that conventional and inexpensive
imidazolium based ILs were also capable to improve Pt/C catalyst in
terms of both activity and stability.30,31 By systematically
varying the side chain lengths of the imidazolium cations ([CnC1 im][NTf2], n = 2, 4, 6, 10), a distinct dependence of catalytic activity
of Pt toward ORR on the side chain length was identified. The highest
activity is obtained using an IL with medium chain length (n = 4), as a counterbalance between higher hydrophobicity
to more efficiently suppress the formation of oxygenated species and
more severely hindered accessibility of Pt sites with elongation of
side chain length of ILs.31 It is also
unambiguously confirmed that the IL phase can stabilize Pt catalysts
by lowering the Pt dissolution rate, based on the combined identical
location transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (SFC-ICP-MS) analyses.31 These
successful attempts verify the feasibility of improving both the electrochemical
activity and stability of Pt/C catalysts by fabricating SCILL samples.
However, it remains a mystery about whether this methodology can be
transferred from monometallic Pt to more practical relevant multimetallic
Pt-based alloy catalysts with sophisticated structures.

To this
end, here in the current work, the SCILL concept will be
applied to a cutting edge ORR catalyst, i.e., trimetallic PtNiMo/C,
which represents so far one of the most efficient ORR catalysts in
terms of both activity and stability.24,32 The two most
promising ILs, [BMIM][NTF2] and [MTBD][BETI], were used for the modifications,
with IL loading amounts on the resultant SCILL samples systematically
varied from 7 to 38 wt %. We aim to fill the knowledge gap about whether
the activity of the cutting edge PtNiMo/C catalyst can still be boosted
and more importantly whether the appealing stabilizing effect of IL
modification on the monometallic Pt catalyst can be maintained in
the presence of base metals. Furthermore, the degradation mechanism
of the pristine and IL modified trimetallic catalysts is comprehensively
investigated based on identical location TEM and in situ SFC-ICP-MS analyses. On one hand, we found that the presence of
IL could boost the ORR performance on these practically relevant PtNiMo/C
electrocatalysts, and the boosting effect is sensitive to the exact
loading amount of ILs, while on the other hand, we discovered that
the ILs could accelerate the leaching of Mo in the catalysts, which
compromises the stabilization effect of Mo on the catalysts and therefore
leads to a worse durability performance compared to pristine counterparts.
These findings would shed new light on the role of ILs in modifying
the structural as well as catalytic properties of a solid catalyst
and would also have great implications for developing other high-performing
catalytic systems following the SCILL concept.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
Pt(acac)2 (98%),
Ni(acac)2 (95%), Mo(CO)6 (99%), HClO4 (70 wt %), [BMIM][NTF2] (98%), and 7-methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene
([MTBD], 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (99.8+%) and benzoic acid (99%)
were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lithium bis(perfluoroethylsulfonyl)imide
(99%) was purchased from IoLiTec GmbH. All chemicals were used as
received without further purification. Deionized water (<1.1 μS
cm–1) was supplied by VWR chemicals and was used
for the prepartion of all aqueous solutions.

2.2 Synthesis
of [MTBD][BETI] IL
[MTBD][BETI]
was synthesized from 7-methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0] dec-5-ene
[MTBD] and the lithium salt lithium bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)imide
Li[BETI] according to the procedure described by Luo et al. The detailed
synthetic procedure can be found in the Supporting Information. The purity of the resulting IL was characterized
by 1H NMR analysis (Figure S1).

2.3 Synthesis of PtNiMo/C Catalyst
The
synthesis of carbon supported PtNiMo catalyst was carried out by employing
a surfactant free solvothermal method following literature procedures.32−34 Detailed information can be found in the Supporting Information.

2.4 Synthesis of PtNiMo/C SCILL
System
The modification of the catalyst with ILs was conducted
as described
in our previous works: 40 mg of catalyst was mixed with 10 mL of isopropanol
(ultrapure) containing a specific amount of IL in order to achieve
7, 16, 27, or 38 wt % loading on the as-prepared SCILL samples, and
the loading amount of IL is defined as  where mIL and mcatalyst refer to
the masses of IL and PtNiMo/C,
respectively. A typically synthesis procedure for a SCILL system is
as follows: The mixture was stirred for at least 30 min and ultrasonicated
for another 30 min before the solvent was slowly removed by rotary
evaporation (40 °C, 120 mbar), followed by further evaporation
at 10 mbar. Finally, the sample was dried under vacuum at 80 °C.
In this work we tested an imidazolium- ([BMIM][NTF2]) and a triazabicyclodecene-based
([MTBD][BETI]) IL. The structural formulas can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structural formulas of
(a) [BMIM][NTF2] and (b) [MTBD][BETI].

2.5 Instrumentation
The exact loadings
of Pt, Ni, and Mo on the samples were determined using inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Optima 2000DV, PerkinElmer). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
were collected on a StadiP (Stoe) using a Ge(111)
monochromator with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å). 1H NMR spectra of the ILs were recorded on an Advance III spectrometer
(Bruker), using DMSO-d6 as solvent. High
resolution TEM and STEM images were recorded using a JEM2100F (JEOL)
with a field emission gun operating at a nominal acceleration voltage
of 200 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy line-scan measurements
were performed in STEM mode with an X-ray detector (X-max80, Oxford
Instruments). Identical-location TEM was carried out using a holey-carbon
finder-grid (QUANTIFOIL G200F1). More details about the sample preparation
and TEM measurements can be found in the Supporting Information.

2.6 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements were carried out on a PARSTAT Multichannel Potentiostat
(PMC-1000, AMETEK) which is controlled by VersaStudio software. A
leak-free double-junction Ag/AgCl electrode (Aldrich) was used as
reference electrode and a Pt wire (PINE) as counter electrode. All
potentials reported in this work were calibrated against a reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) using hydrogen evolution-oxidation reaction
on a Pt electrode. A glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (GC-RDE,
5 mm diameter, PINE) was used as the working electrode. Further details
on the electrochemical measurements are summarized in the Supporting Information.

Electrochemical
dissolution tests for Pt, Ni, and Mo were carried out on an in situ scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometer (SFC-ICP-MS) (NexION 300X, PerkinElmer) as
described in previous works.35,36 The ink preparation
and dropcasting process followed a similar procedure to the RDE experiments,
with slight modifications necessary for the SFC-ICP-MS measurements.
A glassy carbon plate (SIGRADUR G, HTW) was polished with 0.05 μm
alumina paste (Stuers), with repeated polishing until ultrapure water
easily beaded off while rinsing. A catalyst ink was prepared with
ultrapure water, 25% isopropanol, and 5% Nafion solution. The ionomer/carbon
ratio was held at 0.35 g g–1, while an appropriate
volume was used to obtain a final loading of 10 μgPt cm–2 based on a final working electrode area of
0.01 cm2 from dropcast spots of 0.3 μL on the glassy
carbon plate. The suspension was sonicated with a horn sonifier and
ice cooling, and then an aliquot was immediately diluted with ultrapure
water immediately prior to dropcasting to obtain a 12.5% isopropanol,
as lower alcohol contents are required for dropcasting on GC plates
without a PTFE shroud.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalyst Characterization
The trimetallic
PtNiMo colloidal nanoparticles were synthesized via a surfactant-free
solvothermal approach. The resulting nanoparticles were immobilized
on high surface area carbon black (Ketjenblack EC-300J) to obtain
PtNiMo/C. ICP-OES analysis was conducted to determine sample compositions
and offered a Pt-loading of 17.3 wt % and a final atomic composition
of Pt:Ni:Mo = 1:0.44:0.01. From TEM analysis (Figure 2a–b) it can be seen that nanoparticles
adopt a unique octahedral shape and uniformly distribute over the
carbon support without any severe aggregation. The statistical analysis
of over 300 randomly selected nanoparticles reveals that the average
particle size of PtNiMo is 6.0 ± 0.9 nm. As displayed in Figure 2c, the XRD analysis
reveals that all the diffraction peaks shifted toward higher angles
relative to those of the reference Pt, which indicates a contracted
Pt lattice due to the alloying of Pt with base metals (i.e., Ni).
No additional peak from either Ni or Mo species can be detected in
the XRD pattern, confirming the formation of a single Pt-based alloy
phase.

3.2 Electrochemical Characterization
The thin-film
RDE technique was used to analyze the electrochemical
properties of the catalysts. Figure 3 shows the resulting CV curves of the pristine and
IL modified samples. All catalysts exhibit the characteristic signals
of H adsorption/desorption over Pt surfaces in the potential range
of 0.05–0.4 V and surface oxidation of Pt (i.e., formation
of Pt–OHad) in the potential range of 0.8–1.0
V. Only minor changes can be observed in the CVs after the introduction
of IL to the PtNiMo/C catalysts. In the H-adsorption/desorption regime
a slight suppression of the corresponding peaks can be noted (illustrated
by arrows). However, the hereby calculated electrochemically active
surface area (ECSAH) does not suffer from a drastic loss
and decreases only slightly from 45 to 39 m2 g–1Pt. This trend can also be confirmed by the results obtained
from CO-stripping experiments (ECSACO), which are in good
agreement to the ECSAH (see Figure S2). These results obtained from cyclic voltammetry prove that
most of the active sites of PtNiMo/C are not being blocked by the
ILs and are still accessible to protons. Apart from the H-regime a
closer look at the OHad-regime (0.8–1.0 V) shows
that the Pt–OH oxidation as well as the corresponding reduction
peak are incrementally suppressed, when the amount of IL is increased.
This protection of active sites from forming nonreactive oxygenated
species can be observed for both ILs and is in line with our previous
results.26,27

modified PtNiMo/C
with varied IL loading amounts of (a) [BMIM][NTF2] and (b) [MTBD][BETI],
recorded in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte
(scan rate: 20 mV s–1).

The electrocatalytic properties of the pristine and IL modified
PtNiMo/C catalysts toward the ORR were analyzed by using the thin
film RDE technique. The resulting anodic polarization curves are shown
in Figure 4. By examining
the mixed kinetic-diffusion controlled region (0.85–0.95 V),
a positive shift of the half wave potential (E1/2) can always be found on the IL modified catalysts with
IL-loading amounts up to 27 wt %, verifying that the presence of ILs
can also boost the ORR kinetics over these PtNiMo/C catalysts. This
boosting effect can be observed for both ILs, while it is more pronounced
for [MTBD][BETI] (+14 mV) than for [BMIM][NTF2] (+8 mV). However,
further increasing the IL loading to 38 wt %, leads to a reversal
of this trend and a negative shift in E1/2.

varied IL loading amounts of (a) [BMIM][NTF2] and (b) [MTBD][BETI],
recorded in O2 saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution
(20 mV s–1).

A more detailed view on the development of the ORR activity is
received after quantifying the specific activities (SA) and mass-specific
activities (MSA) at 0.9 V, as shown in Figure 5. Hereby, it becomes clear that the ORR activity
is improved for both ILs when the IL-loading is increased up to 27
wt %. Specifically, the MSA values of Pt are increased by 50% and
70% when [BMIM][NTF2] and [MTBD][BETI] are in use, respectively. The
highest ORR activity with a MSA over 1.2 A mg–1Pt and a SA of almost 3 mA cm–2Pt was reached by using 27% of [MTBD][BETI]. Interestingly, higher
IL-loadings (38 wt %) have a negative impact on the ORR-performance
regardless of the ILs being used, and in the case of [MTBD][BETI],
the performance is even inferior to that of the pristine counterpart.
This result is not surprising since similar IL-loading dependent behavior
of ORR performance has already been observed on Pt/C catalysts and
also noble metal free Fe–N–C catalysts, which can be
rationalized by the counterbalance between more efficient IL boosting
effect and higher resistance of O2 diffusion within the
IL phase.27,37

(b) specific activity
of pristine and IL-modified PtNiMo/C catalysts at 0.9 V.

3.3 Durability Tests
Furthermore, we
applied accelerated degradation test (ADTs) to probe the possible
influence of IL modification on the durability of the catalysts. We
chose an ADT protocol, which is widely used for evaluating the durability
of Pt-based catalysts using repeated voltammetric cycling in the potential
range of 0.6 to 1.1 V. Since this anodic vertex potential is not sufficient
to trigger severe carbon corrosion, the possible catalyst degradation
would mainly stem from structural changes of the nanoparticles during
the test.16,38,39Figure 6 compares ECSA, coverage of
nonreactive oxygenated species (θOH,ad), and E1/2 for the pristine and 27 wt % SCILL samples
before and after the ADT. The pristine PtNiMo/C catalyst offers convincing
durability results, as 90% of its initial ECSA and MSA was retained
after 12,000 cycles. The E1/2 is shifted
by only −4 mV over the cycling period, leading to a MSA of
0.5 A mg–1Pt, which proves the successful
stabilization effect of the Mo-doping.

Figure 6 Changes in (a) ECSA,
adsorption of oxygenated species and (b) half-wave
potential of PtNiMo/C with/without ILs after 12,000 potential cycles
with a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 between 0.6 and 1.1
V. The IL loading is 27 wt % for both SCILL samples.

Surprisingly, the IL modified PtNiMo/C-SCILL samples show
a significantly
higher loss in the ORR activity than the pristine sample. The E1/2 is shifted negatively by 13 mV for PtNiMo-[BMIM][NTF2]
and even 20 mV for PtNiMo-[MTBD][BETI] (Figures 6b and S4). Interestingly,
it turns out that the degraded SCILL samples exhibit similar end activity
(0.5–0.6 A mg–1Pt) to the pristine
PtNiMo/C. It appears that the similar end activities of the ADT result
from either oxidative decomposition or loss of the IL during potential
cycling. However, ILs are known to be extraordinarily stable in terms
of their electrochemical window.40 For
example [BMIM][NTF2] was tested to be stable between −2.0 and
2.7 V (vs Ag).41 Although it is also known
that the presence of catalytically active Pt and even water can reduce
the upper potential limit of ILs,41,42 it should
be emphasized that the carbon support is the more vulnerable part
in terms of the oxidation stability of a SCILL catalyst. As to the
possible loss of IL during the ADT, in our previous investigation
on Pt/C-[BMIM][NTF2] a high retention of the ORR activity was still
observed after the ADT, proving that the [BMIM][NTF2] still remains
after applying a rather positive potential of up to 1.4 V (vs RHE).27 To better clarify this issue, herein we applied
STEM-EDX analysis of six different spots (∼2 μm spot
size) on PtNiMo-[MTBD][NTF2] (27 wt %) before and after the ADT to
indisputably prove the presence of IL on the catalyst surface even
after 12,000 potential cycles. From the EDX spectrum in Figure S6 the expected signals from IL (F and
S) can be observed. By comparing the F/Pt ratio, we can present here
a piece of strong evidence that no severe loss of IL occurs during
the ADT and the amount of IL is still comparable to that of the pristine
sample. This result proves that the activity loss of the PtNiMo-SCILL
catalysts does not simply stem from loss of IL into the electrolyte.
As the ECSA is satisfyingly retained (>92%) for these SCILL samples,
the reason for the higher drop in ORR activity seems not to stem from
typical degradation mechanisms like coalescence of nanoparticles or
Pt dissolution. It can also be noticed that initial θOH,ad values on the SCILL samples are lower than that on the pristine
PtNiMo/C (Figure 6a),
indicating that the presence of IL can to some extent suppress the
formation of those nonreactive oxygenated species which is in line
with previous works. Nevertheless, the θOH,ad values
on both SCILL samples have increased by almost 2 times after the ADT,
as shown in Figure 6a, while this is not the case for the pristine PtNiMo/C sample. This
result implies that the presence of ILs would have induced some significant
surface restructuring of PtNiMo/C catalysts during the ADT, which
may eventually result in the different degradation behavior of PtNiMo
catalysts with/without ILs.

We used identical-location TEM to
probe the structural change of
pristine and [MTBD][BETI] modified PtNiMo/C before and after the ADT.
Herein we disclose that both pristine and SCILL samples undergo comparable
changes in particle morphology during the ADT. As displayed in Figure 7, no migration or
coalescence of nanoparticles can be observed and the average particle
size stays constant at ∼6.0 nm. High resolution images in the
upper part of Figure 7 reveal, however, that the octahedral shape of the nanoparticles
is lost during the ADT and the nanoparticles take an almost spherical
shape by truncating the corners of the octahedra. Loss of the octahedral
shape is considered as one of the major causes for activity decline
of PtNi-nanoparticles, since the surface proportion of the most active
(111) facets is reduced. Although Mo-doping is reported to stabilize
the octahedral shape by reducing the leaching rate of Ni, we could
not observe a full retention of the shape. We also made an attempt
to distinguish the composition changes of these two samples before
and after ADT by recording STEM-EDX line-scan profiles on individual
nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 8. It can be found that the signals from Pt and Ni are
distributed evenly over the whole particle, while an obvious reduction
in atomic Ni/Pt ratio can be observed for both samples (Figure 8) after ADT. To be specific,
the ratio is reduced from 0.14 to 0.10 for the pristine catalyst and
from 0.14 to 0.11 for the PtNiMo-[MTBD][BETI] sample. A possible change
of the Mo concentration in the particles cannot be determined, as
the Mo amount is too low to be unambiguously detected. Therefore,
other techniques in addition to TEM and STEM-EDX are still needed
to clearly distinguish the degradation mechanism of the pristine and
SCILL-modified PtNiMo/C.

pristine PtNiMo/C
and (e–-h) PtNiMo/C with 27 wt % [MTBD][BETI] before and after
the ADT (12,000 cycles, 0.6–1.1 V vs RHE, 50 mV s–1).

of (a)
PtNiMo/C and (b) PtNiMo/C with 27 wt % [MTBD][BETI] before and after
the ADT. The insets show individual nanoparticles before the ADT.

Close inspection of the CV curves before and after
the ADT (Figure S5) indicates that in contrast
to the
overall decreased H redox signals on the pristine PtNiMo/C after the
ADT, both SCILL samples exhibit strengthened H adsorption/desorption
peaks at 0.2–0.3 V (highlighted by arrows), which may correspond
to the evolvement of (100) facet/steps during the ADT.43−45 This selective evolvement of specific Pt sites would be a consequence
of the promoted Ni-leaching in the presence of ILs. Figure 9 compares the ECSA values of
three catalysts at different cycle numbers of the ADT. Starting from
the same ECSA level as the pristine catalyst, especially the [BMIM][NTF2]
modified sample shows a significant ECSA increase (15%) during the
first 1000 cycles, followed by an almost linear decline from 56 to
46 m2 gPt–1. This result not
only explains the high ECSA retention of the SCILL catalyst but also
confirms again the dramatic difference in surface restructuring as
well as degradation mechanism especially in the beginning of the ADT
between the pristine and IL-modified PtNiMo/C catalysts.

Figure 9 Development
of ECSA during the ADT for pristine PtNiMo/C and PtNiMo/C-SCILL
catalysts with 27 wt % IL.

In order to better differentiate the degradation behavior of pristine
and IL modified PtNiMo/C, we employed the in situ SFC-ICP-MS technique to quantify the amounts of dissolved metals
during the ADT tests. Figure 10a shows the dissolution profiles of different metals, from
which it can be seen that a significant dissolution occurs for all
three metals upon the SFC making contact with the catalyst-coated
working electrode when the open circuit potential conditions were
established. Thereafter, the highest dissolution rate is observed
at the beginning of the ADT for all three samples, while the dissolution
quickly drops back, as shown in Figure 10a. Figure 10b compares the amounts of dissolved metal in the pristine
and SCILL samples, from which it can be seen that the total dissolution
amount of Pt is less than 0.25% for all the investigated samples,
which agrees with the well maintained ECSA values after ADT (Figure 6a). These results
imply that direct Pt dissolution would play a minor role in the degradation
process for these samples regardless of the IL modifications. In contrast,
the dissolution amounts of Ni and Mo species are over 1 order of magnitude
higher than that of Pt, which is not surprising considering their
non-noble metal nature. At the same time, it is observed that the
dissolution amounts of the base metal components in PtNiMo/C especially
of Mo in both SCILL samples are much higher than those of the pristine
counterpart. Specifically, the dissolution amounts of Ni and Mo are
around 5% and 7%, respectively, on the pristine PtNiMo/C. The dissolution
of Ni amounts up to 10% on PtNiMo-[BMIM][NTF2] and 12% on PtNiMo-[MTBD][BETI],
and it is remarkable to observe that the dissolution amounts of Mo
are as high as 43% and 57% on PtNiMo-[BMIM][NTF2] and PtNiMo-[MTBD][BETI],
respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the presence
of IL could aggravate the dissolution of base metal components in
PtNiMo/C samples during ADT, which is different from the documented
stabilizing effect of IL-modification on the monometallic Pt catalysts.27,30,31

by SFC-ICP-MS after 200 cycles between 0.6 and 1.1 V (vs RHE) with
a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

To better resolve the metal dissolution under voltage-cycling conditions,
we performed additional SFC-ICP-MS experiments with a fresh catalyst
coating, by recording metal dissolution profiles during two consecutive
CV measurements between 0.05 and 1.5 V with a slow scan rate of 10
mV s–1. As shown in Figure 11, two dissolution peaks can be identified
on each cycle for all three samples. The dissolution of Pt and Ni
starts at high potential region (>1.0 V) in the anodic scan, and
dominant
dissolution peaks emerge in the cathodic scan, which is consistent
with previous reports.36,46 Interestingly, an additional
minor dissolution peak for Mo can be observed in the anodic scan at
a relatively low potential region, which is absent on the dissolution
profiles of both Pt and Ni. This additional peak might arise from
dissolution of formed molybdenum oxides species. At the same time,
the quantification results in Figure S7 confirm that the dissolution amount of Pt (<0.5%) is less significant
than those of Ni and Mo for all three samples. It is also noteworthy
that the total dissolution amounts of Ni and Mo on the IL modified
PtNiMo/C samples are much higher than that on the pristine sample
(Figure S7b). This result verifies again
that the introduction of ILs has induced aggravated dissolution of
base metal components in a trimetallic PtNiMo/C catalyst.

time and potential resolved dissolution profiles for
Pt, Ni, and Mo of pristine PtNiMo/C. Potential window: 0.05–1.5
V (vs RHE); scan rate: 10 mV s–1.

Based on the above SFC-ICP-MS analyses we can get a clearer
picture
about the degradation mechanism of PtNiMo/C catalysts with/without
IL. Both ILs impose a significant impact on the degradation of PtNiMo/C
and are responsible for the more severe activity loss of PtNiMo/C-SCILL
catalysts compared to the pristine sample. As mentioned above, the
activity drop of the SCILL samples cannot be attributed to the loss
of Pt, as only minor amounts of Pt are dissolved during this test
(<0.25%), which is in accordance with the high ECSA retention (<92%)
after 12,000 potential cycles. The IL induced accelerated dissolution
of base metal components, especially the high dissolution of Mo (up
to 60%), is likely responsible for the accelerated degradation of
the SCILL samples, as Mo is believed to play a crucial role in the
stabilization of the alloy by preventing Ni dissolution. Losing this
stabilization effect likely leads to dealloying of PtNi and diminishing
of the Ni related promotion effect on Pt, as evidenced by the enhanced
θOH,ad values on both SCILL samples after the ADT.

The last puzzle is to understand the origin of the accelerated
dissolution of base metals especially of Mo in the presence of ILs.
In aqueous medium, an insoluble passive oxide film tends to form on
surfaces of transition metals including Ni47 and Mo48−50 under anodic polarization conditions.51 The passive oxide film can prevent further oxidation
or dissolution of these metals even in acidic electrolyte as observed
on pristine PtNiMo/C, on which the dissolution amounts of both Ni
and Mo are less than 10% after the ADT. Therefore, it appears that
the much higher dissolution rates of both Mo and Ni on IL-modified
PtNiMo samples stem from the absence of the passive oxide layer. ILs
can take effect either by suppressing the formation of the metal oxide
layer as observed on Pt-based catalysts,30,31 or by the high solubilizing power of ILs for metal oxides due to
their strong complexing capability toward metal ions.52−56 To clarify this issue, we performed additional electrochemistry
measurements on Mo/C and MoO3/C samples (10 wt % Mo) with
and without [BMIM][NTf2] (30 wt %), as shown in Figures S8 and S9. It can be seen that the oxidation signals
at around 0.7 V, stemming from the formation of MoO3 species,57 can be clearly identified on all four samples,
indicating that the presence of IL has not significantly impeded the
formation of oxide layer/species. With increasing the cycle number,
the oxidation peak gradually strengthens and then stabilizes on pristine
samples, while in contrast, the same oxidation peak rapidly vanishes
on the IL modified ones and becomes almost completely invisible after
100 cycles, leaving over a CV curve resembling that of carbon support.
These results verify that the presence of IL can accelerate the loss
of Mo, and they also infer that the passive metal oxide species can
hardly survive in the presence of IL under electrochemical conditions.
The same conclusion can also be reached by performing in situ SFC-ICP-MS experiments on Mo/C and MoO3/C with and without
IL. As shown in Figure S10, both Mo/C and
MoO3/C exhibit more severe dissolution after the IL modification,
and the presence of IL has increased the percentage loss of Mo by
25% and 35%, respectively. These results prove a drastic change in
the corrosion resistance of molybdenum species in the presence of
IL and provide another piece of evidence that the IL has accelerated
the loss of molybdenum species. Similarly, Abbott et al. reported
that the passive metal oxide film was less likely to exist in an imidazolium-based
IL electrolyte due to the solvation of IL–metal complexes.51 To clarify whether this is also the reason for
higher loss of Ni in the presence of IL, we analyzed the dissolution
profiles of Ni over a Mo-free PtNi/C sample using the in situ SFC-ICP-MS technique (Figure S11). It
is found that (1) the Ni dissolution amount is much higher on PtNi/C
(37%) than that on PtNiMo/C (10%), verifying that the presence of
Mo can effectively stabilize Ni against dissolution; (2) the presence
of IL imposes little effect on the overall dissolution amount of Ni
in PtNi/C. Therefore, the higher Ni loss on IL-modified PtNiMo/C samples
is more likely a consequence of the accelerated Mo loss in the presence
of IL and the associated compromised stabilization effect of Mo. These
results lead us to conclude that ILs are capable of selectively solubilizing
molybdenum species in trimetallic PtNiMo/C samples due to their strong
complexing interaction with ILs, which would not only accelerate the
leaching of Mo itself but also compromise its stabilizing effect against
Ni dissolution and eventually lead to worse overall stability. In
the case of pristine PtNiMo/C, the formation of a passive molybdenum
oxide layer, however, will make molybdenum species be better retained
under the ADT conditions, and consequently pristine PtNiMo/C sample
exhibits a significantly lower total loss of base metals and a superior
electrochemical stability to those SCILL samples. Moreover, the presence
of IL on metal surfaces may cause localized dealloying and/or adsorbate
induced surface segregation of these trimetallic nanoparticles by
affecting the surface diffusion coefficients of different metal components,58−60 which could also contribute to the more dramatic change in the surface
structure and eventually the worse durability performance of the SCILL
samples. Further extensive microscopic and spectroscopic studies are
still required before a more fundamental understanding of accelerated
leaching of Mo and Ni in the presence of IL can be achieved.

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, the present work proves the
boosting effect of ILs
toward the ORR on a practically relevant PtNiMo/C. An imidazolium
([BMIM][NTF2]) and a triazabicyclodecene- ([MTBD][BETI]) based ILs
were used to modify catalysts with IL-loadings ranging between 7 wt
% and 38 wt %. Both ILs can bring about activity enhancement by up
to 50–70%, which was most pronounced at an IL-loading of 27
wt %. The boosting effect on their ORR activity was shown to be dependent
on the choice of IL. Besides, no severe change in the ECSA was observed
after the introduction of IL, while the adsorption of oxygenated species
could be suppressed. From accelerated durability tests it is observed
that the stabilization effect of the Mo-doping was lost after introducing
IL to the catalyst. With the help of identical-location TEM we demonstrate
that both pristine and IL-modified PtNiMo/C catalysts suffer from
loss of their octahedral shape after the ADTs, whereas typical degradation
reactions such as migration, agglomeration, or particle detachment
were successfully suppressed. In situ SFC-ICP-MS
analyses indicate that IL would selectively accelerate the dissolution
of Mo in PtNiMo/C, which leads to the loss of a stabilization effect
of Mo and consequently worse durability of SCILL samples. These findings
show that future research needs to identify possibilities to avoid
the dissolution of less noble components in Pt-based alloyed ORR catalysts,
for instance, by engineering the molecular structure of ILs, with
the hope of leveraging the IL-boosting effect without compromising
their durability performance.
