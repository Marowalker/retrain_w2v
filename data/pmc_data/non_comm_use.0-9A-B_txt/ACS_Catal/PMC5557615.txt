A regioselective
Pd-mediated C–H bond arylation methodology
for tryptophans, utilizing stable aryldiazonium salts, affords C2-arylated
tryptophan derivatives, in several cases quantitatively. The reactions
proceed in air, without base, and at room temperature in EtOAc. The
synthetic methodology has been evaluated and compared against other
tryptophan derivative arylation methods using the CHEM21 green chemistry
toolkit. The behavior of the Pd catalyst species has been probed in
preliminary mechanistic studies, which indicate that the reaction
is operating homogeneously, although Pd nanoparticles are formed during
substrate turnover. The effects of these higher order Pd species on
catalysis, under the reaction conditions examined, appear to be minimal:
e.g., acting as a Pd reservoir in the latter stages of substrate turnover
or as a moribund form (derived from catalyst deactivation). We have
determined that TsOH shortens the induction period observed when [ArN2]BF4 salts are employed with Pd(OAc)2. Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 was found to be a superior
precatalyst (confirmed by kinetic studies) in comparison to Pd(OAc)2.

Introduction
Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings
are well-established, versatile methods
for the selective modification of natural products,1 macrocycles,2 and biomolecules.3 The intrinsic synthetic methodology limitation
is the requirement for substrate prefunctionalization, which adds
synthetic complexity to a multistep sequence, in addition to decreasing
atom economy and increasing downstream chemical waste. For these reasons,
the direct functionalization of C–H bonds has emerged as an
alternative to classical approaches,4,5 where high
selectivities can be achieved in complex systems such as pharmaceutical
targets6 and biological probes involving
metal catalysis.7,8

The C2-selective Pd-mediated
arylation of tryptophan derivative 1, and tryptophan-containing
peptides, has attracted interest
from several groups within the C–H activation field;9 a summary of our previous work10 and the key contributions of Lavilla9b and Ackermann9c are given in Scheme 1. For all the synthetic
methodologies reported to date, one can be critical of the stoichiometric
byproducts (e.g., iodoarenes or Ag) generated from these reactions,
which complicate product purification and in effect mask their global
atom efficiency and utility. For example, Pd-mediated processes using
PhB(OH)2/PhI(OAc)211 gave the arylated products in moderate yields, in addition to PhI
and other byproducts. The conditions require that the aromatic group
of the organoboronic acid be matched with that of the IIII reagent—an issue for the introduction of substituted aromatics.
This problem was in part obviated by eliminating PhI(OAc)2 as reagent/oxidant, using instead Cu(OAc)2 as a cocatalyst
along with PhB(OH)2, with air serving a role as a terminal
oxidant.10a Under such conditions specific
tryptophan-containing peptides were susceptible to aromatic oxidation
by CuII. This can be overcome using presynthesized [Ar1IAr2]X salts at 25 °C in EtOAc in air (Scheme 1).10b However, in that chemistry the arylation selectivity emerged
as an issue, where two arylation products, derived from the transferring
(Ar1 = phenyl) phenyl and static (Ar2 = mesityl)
aromatic groups, was found.

Scheme 1 Development of Conditions for the
Direct C2-Arylation of Tryptophan
Derivatives and Peptides (Selected Examples)
In this study aryldiazonium salts, [ArN2]BF4, have been examined as electrophilic arylating coupling partners
with tryptophan derivatives (1 + 2 → 3, Scheme 1). [ArN2]BF4 salts share similarities with
[Ar1IAr2]X, in terms of both their structure
and reactivity.12 As oxidative addition
of [ArN2]BF4 to Pd0 is rapid,13,14 we anticipated development of a mild and selective process, in the
absence of an exogenous base. In this context, a mild methodology
for the arylation of mainly indole derivatives was reported by Noel
et al., employing aryldiazonium salts and catalytic Pd(OAc)2.14d Noel et al. further suggested a mechanism
akin to Heck–Matsuda type coupling reactions.14d For several years we have independently been investigating
synthetic protocols (Pd catalyst, solvent, temperatures) similar to
those of Noel et al. for tryptophan arylations.14h

A novel arylation protocol has therefore been developed
that provides
a clean and mild synthetic method for the preparation of arylated
tryptophan derivatives. A significant initial rate enhancement in
arylation efficacy was found using catalytic quantities of either
TsOH or Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2: i.e., in place of Pd(OAc)2.

Results and Discussion
The aryldiazonium salts employed
within this study are readily
available from the corresponding anilines by an oxidative process
to generate the tetrafluoroborate salts in excellent yields (see the Supporting Information).15 Treatment of protected tryptophan 1 with 1 equiv of
[PhN2]BF4 (2a) in the presence
of catalytic Pd(OAc)2 in ethyl acetate gave the desired
C2-arylation product 3a in quantitative yield after 16
h at room temperature (ca. 20 °C). This synthetic protocol was
then demonstrated on a series of substituted aryldiazonium salts,
which are collated in Table 1.

b Reaction time extended to 24
h.

Alkylated, electron-donating,
and halide-containing examples provided
good to excellent yields, while the sterically encumbered 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl
salts also proved effective, giving 3e. The quantitative
synthesis of the biphenyl-substituted product 3d provided
access to a product exhibiting fluorescence at long-wave UV light
(excitation at 365 nm), markedly distinct from that of the single-arene-containing
examples or the parent compound 1.10 The tolerance of the synthetic protocol toward halogenated
arenes provides a useful orthogonality to further functionalization
to produce, for example, other biaryl derivatives (from 3h–l). It is important to note that aryldiazonium
salts containing strongly electron withdrawing substituents (3m,n) were not tolerated by this arylation protocol,
an observation also made by Correia and co-workers,14b who described the formation of a diazo side product generated
by the nucleophilic attack of a C2-arylated indole on electron-deficient
aryldiazonium salts. These electron-deficient aromatic groups can
be installed via the reported complementary conditions.10

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures
of 3a,e,k were obtained (see
the Supporting Information); the absolute
stereochemistry of 3k was determined by the crystallographic
analysis and the
product confirmed as S (stereochemistry identical
with that of the l-tryptophan starting material 1, confirming that no racemization takes place at the chiral center).
In the examples where complete substrate conversion was recorded (i.e., 3a–d,f–j), the desired arylation product could be isolated without the need
for column chromatography, which provided a distinct practical benefit
over the equivalent diaryliodonium salt methodologies, in addition
to the selective formation of one arylation product. This advantage
is reflected in the green reaction metrics calculated for both this
and our previously published protocols (Table 2, conditions A–D),10 determined by the CHEM21 green metrics toolkit.16

MI, (total) mass intensity.

In addition to an increase in product yield and decrease in reaction
temperature from the initial set of conditions, several key mass-based
metrics have been improved upon. Conditions utilizing hypervalent
iodine reagents (A and C) have noticeably lower values for atom economy
(AE): i.e., the theoretical maximum efficiency for a particular transformation.
While conditions B do not suffer from this, they do require the undesirable
addition of a second transition metal (in addition to the drawbacks
with certain peptides highlighted above). These trends are also observed
for the reaction mass efficiency (RME), which incorporates yield and
stoichiometry into the simpler AE calculation, thus giving a measure
of the observed reaction efficiency, in comparison to the theoretical
value provided by AE. This can be rationalized through use of the
optimum efficiency metric, which directly correlates these two factors,
highlighting this new process (conditions D) as the most atom and
mass efficient overall.

The most striking improvement can be
seen in the mass intensity
(MI) value, which is an order of magnitude lower for conditions D
in comparison to our initial conditions A. The primary reason for
this dramatic increase is the removal of purification by column chromatography
(silica gel), with other secondary effects including the number of
equivalents of arylating agent used for each set of conditions (a
full breakdown of the MI values can be found within the Supporting Information). Finally, switching the
reaction solvent from neat acetic acid to the more benign ethyl acetate
has a demonstrable health impact, as acetic acid has been ranked as
a “problematic” reaction solvent by the recently published
CHEM21 solvent selection guide17 (ethyl
acetate is ranked as “recommended”).

Peptides
(4 and 6) that had previously
demonstrated oxidative sensitivity to Pd0/CuII-mediated reaction conditions10b were
subjected to the new synthetic protocol. The first arylation product 5 was isolated in excellent yield, with no evidence of undesired
aromatic hydroxylation, seen when CuII was used (Scheme 2). A usable yield
was recorded for 7 (45%). Note that, for these complicated
polar molecules, methanol was used in place of ethyl acetate as the
reaction solvent; the catalyst loading was increased, primarily to
ensure quantitative conversion (thus, products 5 and 7 were isolated as the methyl esters). The [α]D values for 5 and 7 were of magnitude similar
to those of the peptide starting materials 4 and 6, respectively, showing that their stereochemical integrity
was preserved under the reaction conditions, in keeping with the previous
arylations of 1.

Scheme 2 C2-Arylation of Two Selected Peptides
with Aryldiazonium Salt 2a
Preliminary mechanistic investigations for the arylation
of tryptophan
derivatives by aryldiazonium salts were conducted to understand the
behavior of the catalyst system. The C2-phenyl derivative 3a possesses a bathochromic shift of 62 nm relative to 1,10a enabling the kinetic profile of the
arylation reaction to be examined by ex situ UV–visible spectroscopic
analysis. The evolution of 3a at 304 nm at 37 °C
was monitored against time (Figure 1a), reaching completion within ca. 2 h. Product evolution
exhibited a sigmoidal-like curve (Figure 1b), in addition to a significant induction
period (ca. 1 h). Elimination of either substrate 1 or 2a for the duration of the induction period produced kinetic
profiles mirroring that found in Figure 1b, upon addition of all substrates. Thus,
both substrates 1 and 2a are required for
the formation of the active catalyst.

Figure 1 (a) UV–visible spectra showing
formation of 3a (ε = 17626 dm3 mol–1 cm–1) at 304 nm (between 5 min
intervals) from reaction of 1 with 2a at
37 °C. (b) Kinetic plot showing the
evolution of 3a over time (samples filtered through Celite;
dilution ×104 in EtOAc for direct analysis by UV–vis).
General procedure: 1 (1.92 × 10–4 mol, 1 equiv), [PhN2]BF4 (2a;
1.92 × 10–4 mol, 1 equiv), Pd(OAc)2 (9.6 × 10–6 mol, 5 mol %) in EtOAc (5 mL);
overall concentration in [1] = 0.0384 mol dm–3 and [Pd] = 0.00192 mol dm–3. The water content
in the EtOAc solvent was found to be ∼430 ppm (Karl Fischer
titration).

Reported mechanistic
work on the arylation of 3a using
conditions A indicated that palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) were formed
in operando,10a where stabilized Pd(PVP)NP
(ca. 2 nm, PVP = polyvinylpyrrolidinone) was found to be a viable
catalyst in this instance. It was postulated initially that the sigmoidal
curve observed in the current system could be indicative of a quasi-heterogeneous
process and autocatalysis.18 Established
tests5 were therefore used to probe the
catalytic behavior in our system (Figure 2a). Excess Hg (200 equiv) was added to the
reaction mixture at 90 min (a well-known and widely applied heterogeneous
catalyst poison), which had no effect on substrate turnover.19,20 The outcome suggests that aggregated Pd nanoparticulate species
are not required for substrate turnover to occur. Addition of polyvinylpyridine
(PVPy, 200 equiv), thought to bind solubilized PdII ions,21 to the reaction mixture during substrate turnover
(at 90 min) caused cessation of substrate conversion (1). The result of this experiment gave the first indication that the
reaction was likely operating in a homogeneous manner. Filtration
of the reaction mixture through a preheated Celite pad (“hot
filtration test” to remove insoluble Pd black), again applied
during substrate turnover, similarly had no effect on substrate conversion
(see the Supporting Information). Finally,
ex situ TEM images (Figure 2b) of an aliquot taken from the reaction mixture during substrate
turnover showed the presence of a few nanoparticles to the limit of
detection (ca. 1 nm), which were not commensurate with PdNPs observed
in other C–H functionalization reactions.5,10a,19c These findings, taken together, led us to
question whether heterogeneous Pd species were playing a significant
role in these tryptophan arylation reactions at all: that is, beyond
the aggregated Pd contributing via an off-cycle catalyst reservoir
or by a typical catalyst deactivation process.

Figure 2 (a) Reaction profiles
monitored by UV–vis spectroscopic
analysis, where addition of catalyst poison/filtration occurred at
90 min. (b) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of particles
obtained from an aliquot of the reaction mixture at 90 min.

The induction period observed
in the reaction of 1 + 2a → 3a mediated by Pd(OAc)2 suggested that other additives
could influence this process.
Following a screen of different acids, TsOH exhibited a profound positive
effect, drastically reduced the previously observed induction period
seen with Pd(OAc)2 alone, and thus accelerated product
conversion over time. This observation can be explained by formation
of catalytically active “Pd–OTs” complexes in
the reactions; indeed cyclopalladated tosylate Pd catalyst systems
have been reported by both Brown22 and
Bedford.23 Therefore, Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 was prepared and tested.24 Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 (5 mol %) displayed the same
accelerated reaction kinetic profile as that determined when Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %)/TsOH (5 mol %) was used (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Formation of 3a from reaction of 1 with 2a mediated by either 5 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 with
5 mol % of TsOH (open circles) or Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 (closed circles) at 37 °C. All data were obtained by ex situ
UV–vis spectroscopic analysis.

Equivalent yields of the substrates previously tested (Table 1) were found when
5 mol % of Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 was used in place
of Pd(OAc)2 (see the Supporting Information). Additionally, the catalyst loading of Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 could be decreased to 1 mol %, providing the C2-phenyl arylation
product 3a in quantitative yield after 16 h at ambient
temperature (cf. 5 mol % when using Pd(OAc)2, Table 1). We tentatively
attribute the TsOH effect to more reactive Pd catalyst species, while
acknowledging that tosylate anion can influence the reactivity and
stability of the ArN2+ species.25

Finally, in our early screening studies we determined
that the
N-protecting group in 1 exerts a profound influence on
arylation yield. For example, 1, possessing a NHBoc group,
gave arylated product with 53% conversion (by 1H NMR),
significantly lower than that when a NHAc group was employed (resulting
in quantitative yield). In addition, employment of a NHTFA group in 1 appears to either deactivate or inhibit arylation completely,
resulting in no arylation.

Conclusion
A high-yielding, mild,
base-free, and regioselective Pd-mediated
protocol for generation of 2-aryltryptophan derivatives, utilizing
aryldiazonium salts, has been developed. This process offers a significant
improvement over previously reported methods in terms of optimum efficiency,
mass intensity, synthetic utility, and selectivity. The applicability
of this procedure in the modification of two peptides, known to be
susceptible to aromatic oxidation using Pd/Cu cocatalysis, has been
demonstrated.

Preliminary mechanistic studies show that this
reaction network
is likely a complex, multistep reaction pathway. Tests for homogeneous/heterogeneous
behavior, taken together, lead us to conclude that the reaction is
most likely mediated by homogeneous Pd species. Aggregated PdNPs are
formed under the reaction conditions, but during the latter stages
of substrate turnover (confirmed by TEM measurements), most likely
due to catalyst deactivation. Addition of TsOH considerably reduced
the observed induction period. A lower catalyst loading could be used
when the Pd(OTs)2(MeCN)2 catalyst was employed.
Our research group is currently engaged in elucidating the mechanistic
behavior of this and similar14b,14d systems, in addition
to expanding the methodology to peptide arylations (containing tryptophan).
