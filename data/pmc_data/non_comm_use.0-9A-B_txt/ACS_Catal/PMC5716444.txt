Fischer–Tropsch
(FT) synthesis is one of the most complex
catalyzed chemical reactions in which the chain-growth mechanism that
leads to formation of long-chain hydrocarbons is not well understood
yet. The present work provides deeper insight into the relation between
the kinetics of the FT reaction on a silica-supported cobalt catalyst
and the composition of the surface adsorbed layer. Cofeeding experiments
of 12C3H6 with 13CO/H2 evidence that CHx surface intermediates
are involved in chain growth and that chain growth is highly reversible.
We present a model-based approach of steady-state isotopic transient
kinetic analysis measurements at FT conditions involving hydrocarbon
products containing up to five carbon atoms. Our data show that the
rates of chain growth and chain decoupling are much higher than the
rates of monomer formation and chain termination. An important corollary
of the microkinetic model is that the fraction of free sites, which
is mainly determined by CO pressure, has opposing effects on CO consumption
rate and chain-growth probability. Lower CO pressure and more free
sites leads to increased CO consumption rate but decreased chain-growth
probability because of an increasing ratio of chain decoupling over
chain growth. The preferred FT condition involves high CO pressure
in which chain-growth probability is increased at the expense of the
CO consumption rate.

1 Introduction
The Fischer–Tropsch
(FT) process encompasses a collection
of chemical reactions that converts mixtures of CO and H2 (synthesis gas) into liquid hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals.1−4 It is currently primarily used to add value to large reserves of
natural gas and coal by producing low-sulfur diesel or gasoline fuels.
When natural gas is the feedstock for producing synthesis gas, cobalt
is the preferred metal.5 Alternatively,
coal-derived synthesis gas is usually upgraded by iron-containing
catalysts, mainly because of their higher water–gas shift activity.6 In future energy scenarios, similar chemistry
may also be used to upgrade resources such as biomass via synthesis
gas7,8 and to convert CO2 with renewable H2 into liquid fuels and chemicals.9,10 Besides
these practical aspects, catalytic FT synthesis of hydrocarbons continues
to be of substantial scientific interest, because it involves a large
number of elementary surface reaction steps, in which different sorts
of surface intermediates participate, giving rise to CO dissociation,
chain growth into long-chain olefins and paraffins and removal of
oxygen in the form of water.11−13

The complexity of the FT
reaction has led to an intense debate
on the underlying mechanism, which is as old as this nearly one-century-old
reaction itself.14−16 The most-discussed one is arguably the way that the
long-chain hydrocarbons are formed at the catalytic surface. It not
only pertains to the chain-growth step itself but also to the mode
of CO bond dissociation. The original idea proposed by Fischer and
Tropsch was that metal carbide reacts with H2 to produce
methylene, acting as chain-growth monomer for long-chain hydrocarbon
formation via polymerization.2 This idea
was later supported by experimental data17−21 and has been retained up to now.12,13 Alternatively, Pichler and Schulz proposed a chain growth pathway
that proceeds via insertion of CO into the growing chains, followed
by cleavage of the C–O bond.22 Zhuo
et al.23 and Schweicher et al.24 presented theoretical and experimental data,
respectively, to support this mechanism. Also, other chain-growth
monomers have been invoked, such as the formyl group.25 So far, there is no consensus on the dominant mechanism,
essentially because it is difficult to design experiments that allow
distinguishing the two pathways.

Independent of the exact mechanism,
a general feature of the FT
reaction is that it proceeds as a surface polymerization process with
in situ generation of chain-growth monomer, as reflected by the relative
ratios of hydrocarbons of different length usually following a typical
Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution.26−28 Typically, this distribution is discussed in terms of a single parameter,
the chain-growth probability α, defined as 1  where rp and rt refer to the rates of propagation and termination
of the hydrocarbon chain, respectively. As typically the aim of the
FT process is to produce long-chain hydrocarbons, it is important
to understand the kinetic aspects of this chain reaction in which
monomer formation (initiation), chain growth (propagation), and chain
termination are involved. These insights will help to improve activity
and selectivity of FT catalysts.

Regarding FT reaction mechanism,
most attention has been devoted
to understanding CO bond dissociation on FT-active metals such as
cobalt and ruthenium. Kinetically, CO bond dissociation should occur
at a sufficient rate to provide enough monomers for chain growth.12,13 As the activation barrier of CO dissociation on cobalt29−32 and ruthenium32,33 terraces is too high to be consistent
with FT reactivity, H-assisted CO bond dissociation on terraces has
been considered involving HCO34 or HCOH35−38 intermediates. This mechanism can explain the positive reaction
order with respect to H2 assuming that CO dissociation
is the rate-determining step. The alternative view is that step-edges
are the active sites involved in CO dissociation. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations have shown that stepped sites can dissociate
CO with low barrier without the involvement of H atoms.31−33 We have recently confirmed that reversible CO dissociation can occur
on cobalt nanoparticles without the assistance of hydrogen and that
this reaction involves a relatively small fraction of the cobalt metal
surface.39 An important kinetic implication
of this earlier work is that the near-unity reaction order with respect
to H2 observed during CO methanation is not caused by rate-determining
CO dissociation but, instead, by slow hydrogenation of C atoms relative
to CO dissociation.40

In this work,
we focus on the chain-growth mechanism over the same
silica-supported cobalt catalyst. We provide support for the importance
of CHx species as chain-growth monomer
and present experimental evidence for the earlier discussed hypothesis
that chain growth is reversible.41−44 The reversibility of chain-growth
has profound implications on the relation between the composition
of the surface adsorbed layer and the chain-growth probability. We
employ steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis to investigate
chain growth by carefully examining the coverage of carbon-containing
reaction intermediates and transient responses of FT products. These
unique data show that forward and backward chain-growth reactions
are very fast in comparison to other elementary reaction steps including
chain termination. The obtained steady-state and transient data are
used to fit a simplified microkinetic model. Microkinetics simulations
are used to understand in detail the influence of particular reaction
steps on activity and selectivity. Specifically, we will demonstrate
how CO consumption rate strongly decreases with the fraction of free
sites, while the reverse holds true for the chain-growth probability.

2 Experimental Section
Preparation and Basic Characterization
The Co/SiO2 catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation
method
containing 17.1 wt % Co and 0.04 wt % Pt as determined by ICP–OES
(SpectroBlue, Ametek Inc.), where Pt was used as reduction promoter.
The catalysts were dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcined
at 350 °C in static air for 2 h using a heating rate of 1 °C
min–1. Cobalt dispersion was measured by H2-chemisorption on Micromeritics ASAP 2010 after reaction at 450 °C
for 6 h. The average Co particle size is 15 nm as determined by TEM
(FEI Tecnai 20, LaB6, 200 kV) and in situ XRD (D/max-2600, Rigaku).
More details of experimental information on the basic characterization
can be found in the Supporting Information.

In Situ FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra were recorded
on Bruker Vertex V70v instrument. Typically, 15 mg of finely ground
Co/SiO2 catalyst was pressed into a self-supporting wafer
and placed in an environmental transmission IR cell, which can be
subjected to heating, cooling, gas dosing, and evacuation. Before
IR measurements, the catalyst wafer was reduced in situ at 450 °C
in a H2 flow for 2 h. Subsequently, the cell was evacuated
at 450 °C for 1 h to remove adsorbed hydrogen, followed by cooling
to 35 °C in vacuum. Then, an IR spectrum was recorded as background
for subsequent measurements. In a typical experiment, the cell was
pressurized with 10 mbar CO using a needle valve. After 0.5 h, the
cell was evacuated to a pressure lower than 10–5 mbar and heated to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C min–1. IR spectra were recorded every 5 °C at a resolution of 2 cm–1. Each spectrum involved 16 accumulations that were
averaged.

Steady-State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA)
Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) experiments
were performed by a 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 switch when steady-state CO conversion was obtained.
The catalytic activity in steady state was determined online by analyzing
the effluent gas on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with
TCD and FID detectors. The transient responses of Ne, 12CH4, 13CH4, 12CO, and 13CO were monitored by an online mass spectrometer (ESS, GeneSys
Evolution) using m/z values of 22,
15, 17, 28, and 29, respectively. The transients of higher hydrocarbons
were measured by a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer
(Shimazu, GCMS-QP 2010) and a 16-loop sample holder for storage of
gas samples. In this way, the isotopic composition of higher hydrocarbons
formed during a short reaction period can be analyzed. Detailed experimental
and data analysis procedures can be found in the Supporting Information.

3 Results
and Discussion
SSITKA is uniquely suited to determine the
coverage of reversibly
adsorbed surface species during heterogeneous reactions.45−47 In a companion paper, we already discussed CO hydrogenation to CH4 at 260 °C on the same Co/SiO2 catalyst. At
this temperature, the formation of higher hydrocarbons is limited.
The SSITKA data show that CO coverage under methanation conditions
is relatively low (θCO < 0.30).40 As a consequence, CO dissociation is intrinsically fast
as compared to the hydrogenation of C and O species. It is important
to establish how this picture changes when the temperature is decreased
to 220 °C, which is a temperature close to the Fischer–Tropsch
condition. We will first show SSITKA data from which steady-state
reaction rates, surface coverages, and other relevant kinetic parameters
are derived. Then, we will provide evidence for the reversibility
of chain growth, which is decoupling of chains into shorter chains
and C1 monomers, and the importance of high CO coverage
to the FT condition. In the last part, we will discuss a microkinetic
model fitted to experimental transient data and employ simulations
based on this model to identify rate- and selectivity-controlling
steps.

Steady-State Kinetics
Figure 1 shows the kinetic data derived from steady-state
measurements (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information) at different temperatures. We include data obtained at 260 °C
to highlight the influence of temperature. The overall apparent activation
energy is about 74 kJ/mol at pCO = 90
mbar, which is higher than the value of 57 kJ/mol obtained at pCO = 450 mbar. It is also notable that the apparent
activation energies based on the CH4 formation rate are
higher than those based on CO conversion. This is consistent with
the higher CH4 selectivity at lower CO partial pressure
or when the temperature is increased. A necessary condition for FT
synthesis is that CH4 formation has a higher activation
energy than C2+-hydrocarbons formation. This difference
also explains the observation that the reaction orders for CH4 formation with respect to CO partial pressure are more negative
than those for CO conversion. We observe that the chain-growth probability
strongly decreases with temperature. Notably, the chain-growth probability
is in the range of 0.52–0.85 under the conditions applied for
model fitting (vide infra).

measurement as a function

(TOF) of CO conversion, (b) TOF of CH4 formation, (c) reaction
order with respect to CO, and (d) chain-growth probability.

SSITKA experiments were carried
out at 220 °C and 260 °C
to determine steady-state CO and CHx surface
coverages as a function of CO and H2 partial pressure.
A typical SSITKA result following a 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 switch at 220 °C is presented in Figure 2. Figure 3 reports the steady-state CO
coverages obtained from SSITKA at 220 °C and 260 °C as a
function of the CO and H2 partial pressure. In agreement
with literature,38 the CO coverage increases
with CO partial pressure following a Langmuir isotherm dependence.
The CHx coverage does not vary as strongly
with CO partial pressure and a small decrease is noted. Figure 3b shows that the CO coverage
only weakly depends on the H2 partial pressure between
180 mbar and 1800 mbar, whereas the CHx coverage is hardly affected. As outlined in our companion paper,40 this result is consistent with the stronger
adsorption of CO in comparison with H.

following a 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 switch. Condition at steady
state: T = 220 °C, pH2 = 900 mbar, pCO = 180 mbar.

Figure 3 Coverage of CO (squares) and C1 (circles)
species as
determined by SSITKA over the cobalt catalyst as a function of (a)
CO partial pressure and (b) H2 partial pressure at 220
°C (solid symbols) and 260 °C (open symbols).

At 220 °C, the CO coverage reaches a maximum
of 0.46 at a
CO partial pressure of 450 mbar. A further increase does not further
increase the CO coverage. The remainder of the surface is covered
by CHx species, growing chains (adsorbed
C2+), and, probably, irreversibly adsorbed species that
cannot be determined by SSITKA and free sites. This result indicates
that a CO coverage of about 0.5 ML is close to the saturated CO coverage
at this temperature. This is consistent with recent single crystal
Co(0001) data using a Kelvin probe to determine CO coverage.48 DFT calculations of the group of Saeys show
that on the Co(0001) surface a maximum coverage of about 7/12 ML can
be obtained.49

To gain insight into
the fraction of free sites, which cannot be
measured explicitly, we assume that the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium of CO is established. Then, we can express the vacancy
density, θv, as 2  where θCO is the CO coverage, KCO the equilibrium constant of CO adsorption,
which is assumed to be independent of surface coverage, and pCO CO partial pressure. Using actual values
for the applied CO partial pressure and the SSITKA-measured CO coverage
leads to the result that the fraction of vacancies is reduced by a
factor of 7 when the CO partial pressure increases from 90 mbar to
900 mbar, while this fraction only decreased by less than 20% when
the H2 partial pressure increases from 180 mbar to 1800
mbar. This is expected as CO binds much stronger to the Co surface
than H. Importantly, within the range of conditions we study here,
a decrease in the fraction of free sites is strongly correlated to
the CO partial pressure, while it hardly depends on the H2 partial pressure.

Based on this correlation, Figure 4 shows how chain-growth probability
depends on θvKCO. It
emphasizes the strong
correlation between free sites and chain-growth probability. Kruse
and co-workers linked higher chain-growth probability to higher CO
coverage (and thus, CO partial pressure) in the framework of the CO
insertion mechanism.24 In the CO-insertion
mechanism, CO dissociation provides the C1 species that
initiates chain growth. Thus, a decreased CO dissociation rate with
increasing CO coverage is also consistent with the observation that
CO consumption rate decreases. In the following section, we will discuss
an alternative interpretation of these data following the carbide
mechanism, involving reversibility of the chain-growth step.

pressure (denoted as open symbols, pH2 = 180–1800 mbar, pCO =
180 mbar), where θCO is the CO coverage determined
by SSITKA and pCO is CO partial pressure
applied.

Chain-Growth Monomer
The two essentially different
reaction paths proposed for the chain-growth mechanism in the FT reaction
differ by the chain-growth monomer, a CHx species in the carbide mechanism2 and
CO in the CO-insertion mechanism.22 First-principles-based
microkinetics simulations on a stepped Ru surface operating under
FT conditions have demonstrated that CH insertion is the dominant
growth mechanism.50 For both mechanisms,
a necessary condition is that the chain-growth should be relatively
fast compared to chain termination.51

We investigated the possibility of chain growth via CHx species in the following manner. An in situ reduced
catalyst was first exposed to CO flow at 260 °C for 0.5 h to
deposit C atoms, and then evacuated (<10–5 mbar)
at 300 °C for 1 h to remove adsorbed CO, eliminating a possible
contribution of CO insertion into growing hydrocarbons. The absence
of molecularly adsorbed CO was confirmed by IR spectra of adsorbed
CO on the Co/SiO2 catalyst recorded with increasing temperature
(Figure 5a). After
cooling to 200, 220, or 260 °C, the catalyst was exposed to a
H2 flow. As shown in Figure 5b, H2-exposure at 260 °C led mainly
to CH4 and a small amount of C2. When decreasing
the hydrogenation temperature, the MS signals related to C2 and C3 hydrocarbons increased. Considering the absence
of molecular CO, we conclude that the predeposited C species are involved
in the formation of higher hydrocarbons. This further demonstrates
that the carbide mechanism can contribute to chain growth in the FT
reaction.

temperature showing that molecularly adsorbed CO is removed by evacuation
at 300 °C. (b) Evolution of MS signals after H2-exposure

over the cobalt catalyst, which was exposed to a CO flow at 260 °C
for 30 min, followed by evacuation at 300 °C for 1 h.

Cofeeding of 13CO and 12C3H6
In most experimental kinetic
studies of the FT reaction,
it is assumed that the chain-growth step is irreversible. Quantum-chemical
studies of chain growth on metallic cobalt and ruthenium surfaces
according to the carbide mechanism show that the activation barriers
for the insertion of the C1 monomer into a growing chain
and the reverse decoupling are of the same magnitude.43 Microkinetics simulations based on the carbide mechanism
predict that this reversibility should occur under FT conditions.44 In order to experimentally verify the reversibility
of chain growth, we carried out experiments in which 12C3H6 was cofed with 13CO/H2.

Figure 6 shows
that 12CH4 appears in the hydrocarbon products
mixture during 13CO hydrogenation in the presence of 12C3H6. This evidence confirms that the
cobalt nanoparticle surface can decompose C–C bonds under FT
conditions. Additionally, the simultaneous presence of 12C and 13C in C2-products shows that the 12C atoms obtained from 12C3H6 can be coupled to form higher hydrocarbons. We also observe that
hydrocarbons with more than three C atoms contain different amounts
of 12C, indicating that 12CHx species are involved in the reaction as chain-growth monomers.
Thus, this intermediate is both involved in chain growth and chain
decoupling.

Figure 6 Isotopic content of alkane products when cofeeding 12C3H6 with 13CO/H2 as
a function of the CO partial pressure. The colors indicates the number
of 12C atoms in a given hydrocarbon. The markers show the
total 12C fraction for each product. Conditions: T = 220 °C, pH2 = 600 mbar, p12C3H6 = 60 mbar.

To gain an understanding into the chain-growth behavior of
C1 monomers derived from cofed 12C3H6, ASF-plots are presented in Figure 7. A mixture of 12C3H6/H2 without CO gives rise to a hydrocarbons
product distribution qualitatively similar to the distribution obtained
with a CO/H2 mixture. It should be noted that the C3 products are an exception because of the cofeeding of propene.
A substantial fraction of the 12C3H6 is hydrogenated to 12C3H8. This
observation proves that similar chain growth as in the FT reaction
occurs with 12C1 species derived from 12C3H6. Figure 7 also shows that the addition of 12C3H6 to a 13CO/H2 mixture facilitates
the formation of higher hydrocarbons, both in terms of yield and chain-growth
probability. Thus, the higher formation rate of higher hydrocarbons
can be attributed to 12C1 species obtained by 12C3H6 decoupling. As the 12C1 species obtained by 12C3H6 decoupling are free of O, the CO-insertion mechanism cannot
explain this specific case of chain growth. Considering furthermore
that the product distribution in the presence of 12C3H6 (except for C3) is almost similar
to the product distribution obtained without cofed 12C3H6, we conclude that chain growth will proceed
via an O-free C1 species, that is to say via the carbide
mechanism. The chain-growth probability values based on C4–C7 products obtained at different conditions are
summarized in Table 1. Comparing the values with and without 12C3H6, one can see that the increase in chain-growth probability
upon addition of 12C3H6 is limited
by the increase in 13CO partial pressure. Considering the
fact that the CO partial pressure significantly influences the fraction
of free sites,52,53 both 13CO dissociation
and 12C3H6 decomposition will be
facilitated by a decrease in the CO partial pressure, and both reactions
will supply chain-growth monomers, namely, 13C1 and 12C1 monomers, respectively. We observe
in Figure 6 that the 12C content rather than the 13C content in the hydrocarbon
products increases with decreasing 13CO pressure. This
suggests that the 12C3H6 decomposition
profits more from free sites than 13C–O bond scission.
A kinetic implication is that, although C1 supply via CO
dissociation is promoted, an increasing fraction of free sites due
to lowering of the CO partial pressure lowers the chain-growth probability
due to faster chain decoupling.

Transient Response
of FT Products
In the context of
the FT reaction, SSITKA has been most frequently used at conditions
resulting in high methane selectivity (i.e., H2/CO >
2).38,54−58 In this section, SSITKA will be used to investigate
the transient
behavior of the hydrocarbon products during the FT reaction, including
CH4 and higher hydrocarbons. Typical transients of the
isotopologues of C5H12 following a 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 switch are
presented in Figure 8. All responses of partially labeled products display a maximum.
The position of the maximum shifts in time with increasing isotope
content of partially labeled C5 hydrocarbon. The higher
the 13C content, the later the maximum occurs. Taking into
account the 13C content of all the isotopologues allows
inspecting the evolution of 13C fraction within a given
product. An example is presented by the open symbols in Figure 8. This evolution is determined
in the following manner 3  where n is the chain length
of the given product, i the number of 13C atoms in the product molecule, and Ni,n refers to the normalized transient
response of the Cn product with i13C atoms. The fractional 13C evolution
of C1–C5 alkanes are plotted in Figure 9. The result shows
that the evolution of the 13C content of C1–C5 alkanes with time on stream after the switch are almost identical
and thus independent of chain length. The 13C content of
CH4 can be directly correlated to the 13C fraction
of C1 species on surface, as the formation of CH4 does not involve C–C coupling steps but only CO dissociation
and C hydrogenation. An implication of the overlapping of the 13C evolution curves is that the 13C content of
all formed hydrocarbons is strongly correlated to the 13C/12C ratio of C1 species on the surface. This
further underpins that the C1 species is the chain-growth
monomer, rather than CO. Typically, the 13CO/12CO transient in SSITKA, which is directly correlated to the adsorbed 13CO/12CO ratio on the surface, is significantly
shorter than the 13CH4/12CH4 transient (Figure 2). If weakly adsorbed CO is the chain-growth monomer, as proposed
by Schweicher et al. in the CO-insertion mechanism,24 one expects more rapid introduction of 13C fraction
into C2+ products than in CH4. The observation
that the 13C content evolution is independent of chain
length of the hydrocarbon including CH4 therefore demonstrates
that CO insertion cannot be the dominant chain-growth mechanism. Regarding
the process of chain-growth, the formation of a long-chain hydrocarbon
will take more time than the formation of a shorter one. The chain-length-independent 13C evolution suggests that the chain growth and decoupling
steps are very fast in comparison to monomer formation. In this way,
the 13C content of the growing chains is dictated by that
of the C1 species. An important corollary of this finding
is that the chain-growth rate is mainly limited by the supply of C1 monomers under the FT condition on the cobalt catalyst. This
is in agreement with microkinetics simulations showing that, within
the carbide mechanism, chain growth may occur on sites with high CO
coverage as long as the rate of chain growth is fast compared to the
rate of chain monomer supply.12,51 Together with the inverse
correlation between the amount of free sites and the chain-growth
probability (Figure 4) and the reversibility of chain growth evidenced in the previous
section, we conclude that the chain-growth probability is largely
controlled by the rate of chain growth vs chain decoupling. More free
sites implies a higher rate of chain decoupling, while a higher rate
of monomer formation leads to higher chain-growth probability. Recalling
enhanced 12C3H6 decomposition by
a decrease in the 13CO partial pressure, the fraction of
free sites influences chain decoupling more significantly than C–O
scission. This issue will also follow from microkinetic modeling to
be discussed below.

Figure 10 plots
the transients of unlabeled and fully labeled C1–C5 alkanes following a 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 switch. We observed that the transient of
unlabeled short chain hydrocarbon is slower than that of longer ones
and that 12CH4 decays slowest among all unlabeled
products. The fully labeled products appear in the other way around;
that is, the transient responses of fully labeled products become
slower with increasing carbon number. The noteworthy aspect is that
the responses of unlabeled and fully labeled isotopologues of all
products cross each at the same time (∼7 s). At this moment,
as shown in Figure 9, the overall 13C content is ∼50% in all products.
A similar observation was recently reported by Ledesma et al.59 Its reason has been discussed above; that is,
fast chain propagation/decomposition reactions result in a chain-length-independent 13C evolution within a given product.

The residence time of unlabeled and fully labeled hydrocarbons
measured at different CO partial pressure are presented as a function
of chain length in Figure 11. The residence time of unlabeled products decreases with
chain length, while the fully labeled products show an opposite trend
in residence time. The physical meaning of the residence time of CH4 is clear.45,56−58 However, the
meaning of the residence time of higher hydrocarbons is less evident,
as the intermediates of long-chain hydrocarbon can be formed via multiple
routes on the catalytic surface. For instance, C2H6 can be formed via either hydrogenation of adsorbed C2 species, or C–C coupling followed by hydrogenation,
implying that the measured residence time of C2H6 is a combination of several paths. In other words, it is not possible
to directly derive intrinsic formation rate of C2+-hydrocarbons
as is customarily done for CH4 on the basis of its residence
time. Therefore, a model fitting approach is employed to extract kinetic
parameters that intrinsically control the activity and selectivity
of the FT reaction on the Co/SiO2 catalyst.

Transient was performed by a switch from 12CO/H2 to 13CO/H2 at steady state. Conditions: T = 220 °C, pH2 = 900 mbar, pCO = 90–900 mbar.

Microkinetic Modeling
Based on the mechanistic insights
described in the previous sections, a lumped kinetic model44,60 was established and fitted with steady-state kinetic and SSITKA
data obtained at the following conditions: pCO = 90–900 mbar, pH2 = 900 mbar, and T = 220 °C. The model,
which is schematically shown in Figure 12, takes into account the carbide mechanism
and reversible chain growth. As compared to our earlier microkinetic
model based on experimental transient kinetic data determined under
methanation conditions,40 hydrogenation
steps are not explicitly involved but lumped into the rate constants.
This is mainly done not only because involving hydrogenation steps
into the reaction model would dramatically increase the number of
unknown variables but also because the H coverage before and after
the SSITKA switches remains unchanged.60

Figure 12 Schematic representation of the FT mechanism, where θCO presents adsorbed CO, θCi adsorbed chains
of i carbon atoms, Ci desorbed product of i carbon number,
and θv vacant sites. kads/kdes presents the CO adsorption/desorption
rate constants, kdiss the CO dissociation
rate constant, ktm the methane termination
rate constant, kt the chain termination
rate constant, and kf/kb the forward/backward chain growth rate constants.

In the microkinetic model, CO
adsorbs and desorbs with rate constants kads and kdes, respectively.
Adsorbed CO dissociates with rate constant kdiss to yield C and O species. Notably, kdiss implicitly involves the H coverage for the C →
CHx reaction. The latter one is denoted
by C1 and is the chain-growth monomer. All chain-growth
reaction steps, incorporating a C1 species into a growing
chain Ci, are considered to be reversible
with rate constants kf and kb, respectively. These rate constants are assumed to be
independent of the chain length. The intermediate that leads to CH4 and the chain-growth monomer are assumed to be the same C1 species. C1 and Ci desorb as CH4 and long-chain hydrocarbons in single lumped
steps with rate constants ktm and kt, respectively. The value of ktm is expected to be larger than that of kt, as the selectivity of CH4 is always higher
than the expected CH4 selectivity on the basis of the ASF
distribution.26−28 Adsorbed O is hydrogenated and removed as water with
a lumped rate constant kw. Readsorption
of products is not considered in this model. The site balance is expressed
by 4  

The chain-growth
probability is assumed to be chain-length independent
and is determined by α = θCi+1/θCi.44,60 Accordingly, the site balance can be rewritten as 5  

Together with the site balance
(eq 4), there are six
differential equations that describe
this model in terms of the evolution of surface coverage. In steady
state, the differential equations are equal to zero. 6  

The C1 and O coverages are given by 7   8  

As the coverage of growing chain is also constant, we can
write 9  

The carbon balance yields 10  

Numerically solving this set of six
equations will lead to the
steady-state coverages θCO, θO,
θC1, and θv and the chain-growth
probability. The experimental data to be fitted include transient
data (data points in in Figures 11) and steady-state CO conversion rates and chain-growth
probabilities measured at different CO partial pressure (90–900
mbar) at constant H2 partial pressure (900 mbar) (Figure 1). The mathematical
description of the SSITKA model and fitting procedure are described
in Supporting Information.

The curves
in Figure 11 show
the good correspondence between experimental SSITKA
data and model fitting. The rate constants determined by fitting the
data obtained at different CO partial pressure are listed in Table 2. These data normalized
based on the data obtained at the condition of pCO = 90 mbar and pH2 = 900 mbar are plotted in Figure 13 as a function of CO partial pressure. As expected,
the rate constants of CH4 formation (ktm) and chain termination (kt) decrease with rising CO pressure, because increasing CO pressure
is accompanied by a decrease in the H coverage that is implicitly
involved in ktm and kt. We observe that ktm decreases
more pronounced than kt. This difference
is in line with the experimentally observed more negative CO reaction
order on the basis of CH4 than on the basis of CO conversion.
Note that the forward and backward chain-growth rates are orders of
magnitude higher than the other rates. This is in accordance with
a high exchange rate of C1 monomer in the growing chain
(vide infra). The rate constant for CO dissociation (kdiss) depends slightly on CO pressure, which can be explained
by the implicit involvement of the C → CHx reaction. The changes in CO adsorption and desorption can
be explained by increasing lateral interactions at higher CO coverage,
which also explains the minor changes of the other rate constants.
It can be seen that the chain-growth and reversed chain-decoupling
rates are much larger than the rate of monomer formation and termination.
This is in line with the nearly identical evolution of isotopic inclusion
in C1–C5 products as determined in the
SSITKA experiment above (Figure 8).

220 °C, pH2 = 900 mbar, pCO = 90–900 mbar). The data are normalized

Figure 14 shows
model predictions of the steady-state kinetic parameters as a function
of CO partial pressure. Figure 14a highlights the strong dependence of the CO consumption
rate and chain-growth probability on CO coverage. Values for the degree
of rate control (DRC)61,62 are presented in Figure 14b. We also use a degree of
chain-growth control (DCGC, detailed mathematical definition is provided
in Supporting Information), which quantitatively
describes the influence of individual elementary reaction steps on
the chain-growth probability (Figure 14c). Finally, Figure 14d presents the predicted activity (expressed as turnover
frequency, TOF), the chain-growth probability (α, defined as
θCi+1/θCi) and the product distribution as a
function of the free sites fraction. We note that a near-unity CO
coverage in these models represents saturated CO adsorption in the
practical situation rather than monolayer coverage of CO.

220 °C, pH2 = 900 mbar, pCO = 90–900 mbar: (a) surface coverage
and chain growth probability (α); (b) degree of rate control

frequencies (TOFs) of CO consumption, CH4 formation, C2–C4 formation, C5+ formation
and chain-growth probability (α) as a function of the free sites
fraction.

CO coverage markedly increases
with CO pressure, resulting in a
continuous loss of free sites. Concomitantly, the influence of CO
adsorption on the overall rate becomes increasingly negative, which
is consistent with the negative CO reaction order. CO adsorption inhibits
the FT reaction by (i) hampering CO dissociation and (ii) slowing
hydrogenation because of the strong influence of CO adsorption on
H coverage.52,53 Compared with methanation conditions,40 CO dissociation becomes the most rate-controlling
step as there is a lack of free sites and competes with O removal.

The increase in chain-growth probability with CO partial pressure
is caused by two factors, i.e., slow termination by hydrogenation
and inhibited chain decoupling. The former one is confirmed by the
relation between CO pressure and kt and ktm as shown in Figure 13. A nearly 1 order of magnitude decrease
in the fraction of free sites (from 0.2 to 0.02) results in corresponding
decrease of the chain-decoupling rate. In comparison, the increase
in C1 coverage (from 0.036 to 0.023 by SSITKA and from
0.051 to 0.019 predicted by microkinetics simulation) is relatively
small, causing relatively small increase in chain-growth rate. Consequently,
the net rate of chain-growth decreases as CO pressure increases. The
positive correlation between chain-growth probability and CO adsorption
becomes less pronounced when the fraction of free sites decreases.
Then, CO dissociation becomes more important to the DCGC. The effect
of O removal on the chain-growth probability is limited, as there
are two opposing aspects. When more free sites become available by
removing O, the CO dissociation rate and monomer supply increase,
but it also enhances chain decoupling and hydrogenation. Accordingly,
the DCGC values of O removal are only slightly positive. Expectedly,
faster chain termination or methanation lowers chain-growth probability.
It is noteworthy that changing the chain-growth rate constant (kf), while fixing the equilibrium constant (kf/kb, according
to the definition of the DCGC, see the Supporting Information for details) does not affect the chain-growth probability.

Taking into account the backward chain-growth rate, rb,i, and the relation αi = θCi+1/θCi, we rewrite the
expression of chain-growth probability at steady state in (see the Supporting Information for details) 11  where the term rf,i – αirb,i represents the net rate
of Ci + C1 ⇄ Ci+1. To analytically determine the influence of the
rates of termination, forward and backward chain growth on the chain-growth
probability, we calculate the derivative with respect to rt,irf,i, and rb,i as following. 12   13   14  

Since kf and kb are 4 orders of magnitude larger than kt, the rates of chain growth (rf,i) and chain decoupling (rb,i) are much higher than the rate of
chain termination
(rt,i), while the net
rate of chain growth (rf,i – αrb,i), according to eq 10, is of the same order of magnitude as rt,i. In this way, practical values of the chain-growth
probability can be obtained. This approach shows the importance of
chain decoupling on the chain-growth probability. Chain decoupling
significantly decreases the values of ,  and  through the
term rb,irt,i in eqs 12-14. Notably, eqs 11-14 are consistent with the conventional
definition of αi (eq 1) when rb,i goes to zero.

As we discussed above, all
the FT parameters can be directly or
indirectly correlated to the amount of free sites. As a consequence,
the reaction kinetics depends strongly on coverage as presented in Figure 11. As free sites
play an important role in several crucial elementary steps in the
FT reaction, their presence or absence is decisive in directing the
selectivity toward desired FT products. As shown in Figure 14d, a certain fraction of free
sites is needed to activate CO molecules, reflected by the negative
reaction order with respect to CO. Concerning selectivity, reducing
the fraction of free sites leads to high chain-growth probability
by suppressing chain-decoupling. Thus, chain-growth probability and
CO conversion rate are inversely correlated on the cobalt surface
under FT reaction conditions. As commonly observed in catalysis,50,63 the balance between activity and selectivity implies that there
is an optimal surface composition leading to optimum performance in
terms of higher hydrocarbons yield (see C5+ trace in Figure 14d). We find that
CO pressure has the strongest influence on surface coverage. In industrial
practice, CO pressures in the 10–15 bar are usually employed
to achieve high chain-growth probability (0.85 < α < 0.95)
on a highly CO-covered surface.64,65 As suggested by Figure 14d, high chain-growth
probability comes at the expense of CO consumption rate.

Conclusions
The present work provides deeper insight into the relation between
the kinetics of the FT reaction on a silica-supported cobalt catalyst
and the composition of the surface adsorbed layer. We provide experimental
data that unequivocally show that CHx surface
species are involved in chain growth and that chain growth is reversible.
The latter chain-decoupling reaction benefits more from an increase
in free sites than CO dissociation itself. SSITKA measurements at
FT conditions involving hydrocarbons products up to C5 show
that the rates of chain growth and chain decoupling are much higher
than the rates of monomer formation and chain termination. As reversible
CO dissociation is slower than chain growth and the inclusion of isotopic
C in growing chains is independent of chain length, CO cannot be the
chain-growth monomer. A microkinetic model based on the carbide mechanism
and involving reversible chain growth is fitted and used to understand
several intricacies of the FT reaction. The fraction of free sites
plays a crucial role in determining the CO consumption rate and the
chain-growth probability. A high fraction of free sites leads to high
CO consumption rate but decreases chain-growth probability because
of a high ratio of chain decoupling over chain growth. Therefore,
we understand the practical FT process, viz. high CO pressure, in
terms of conditions that maximize the selectivity to heavy hydrocarbons
(high chain-growth probability) at the expense of CO consumption rate.
