Understanding Fe deposition in fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysis
is critical for the mitigation of catalyst degradation. Here we employ
soft X-ray ptychography to determine at the nanoscale the distribution
and chemical state of Fe in an aged FCC catalyst particle. We show
that both particle swelling due to colloidal Fe deposition and Fe
penetration into the matrix as a result of precracking of large organic
molecules occur. The application of ptychography allowed us to provide
direct visual evidence for these two distinct Fe-based deactivation
mechanisms, which have so far been proposed only on the basis of indirect
evidence.

==== Body
Soft X-ray ptychography is a
high-resolution coherent diffraction imaging technique1−3 with demonstrated resolutions of sub 5 nm.4 When employed at a synchrotron, the tunable nature of synchrotron
radiation means that the characteristic absorption edge energies of
different elements can be used for 2D elemental mapping and for determining
the chemical states of the elements by collecting pixel-by-pixel near-edge
X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) data. Owing to the larger
penetration depth of X-rays, thicker samples (up to a few microns)
can be studied than possible with transmission electron microscopy.

Here we employ the unique power of soft X-ray ptychographic chemical
imaging in order to characterize a hierarchically structured complex
porous material as typically employed in heterogeneous catalysis.
As a model material, we chose an individual, commercial equilibrium
catalyst (ECAT) particle used in FCC. This material was selected because
of its importance in catalysis—FCC particles are the workhorse
of current oil refinery—and because understanding the transport
of feedstock molecules through the pore space of these particles is
essential for improving the efficiency of the cracking process and
the lifetime of the catalyst.5−8

More specifically, it was shown that metal
accumulation and deposition
into the catalyst body can influence the product distribution and
reduce catalytic activity by reducing bulk accessibility5,9−13 and damaging the zeolite domains.14−16 The latter are embedded
in the particle matrix and represent the catalytically most active
phase of the catalyst. FCC catalyst particles are a compound material
consisting of a macro- and meso-porous matrix (pores sizes above 50
nm and between 2 to 50 nm, respectively17) mainly formed by clay and some additives, as well as embedded microporous
zeolite crystallites (pore sizes below 2 nm17).18−20 The matrix plays an important role in the cracking
of the heavy, long-chain feedstock molecules into product molecules
like gasoline, because the large feedstock molecules cannot enter
the micropores of the zeolite and therefore need to be precracked
by the active part of the catalyst matrix. It was suggested that it
is this precracking of metal carrying feedstock molecules like porphyrin,
porphyrin-like complexes, or naphtenates that causes the deposition
of Ni (mainly porphyrins21) and Fe (organic
Fe, naphtenates22) in the pore space of
the catalyst.5,8,23,24 Previous 2D studies of individual FCC catalyst
particle cross sections and recent 3D measurements of whole particles5,9−11 reported a 1–5 μm thick surface layer
of increased Fe13,22,25−27 and Ni23−25,28 concentrations for both industrially as well as lab-deactivated
catalysts, suggesting low metal mobility after deposition. However,
in the case of Fe, a second deposition mechanism was suggested through
deposition of colloidal Fe originating from the reactor hardware or
soil contamination. This second mechanism was assumed to be mainly
responsible for the formation of a nodulated particle surface as observed
for FCC catalysts with high Fe concentrations, because the Fe particles
are too large to enter the catalyst and are, therefore, deposited
on the particle surface. Once deposited, Fe can cause a vitrification
of the particle surface by lowering the melting point of the material.25

While previous spectroscopic and microscopic
studies have provided
valuable insight into the deposition of Fe,5,9,11,25−27 Fe speciation within an ECAT FCC catalyst has not yet been performed.
The reason is that a technique is required that allows high-resolution
chemical mapping of relatively low Fe concentrations in thick samples
(several hundreds of nanometers, i.e. the typical size of zeolite
domains) to maintain the structural integrity of the porous sample.
Fe speciation is needed to fully understand the complex deposition
mechanism of Fe in FCC particles. As discussed above, deposited Fe
is known to block pores, thereby reducing catalyst activity,5 but Fe is also present in the matrix as a constituent
of the kaolin clay. Spatially resolved NEXAFS is therefore needed
to investigate whether the deposited Fe is in a different chemical
state to the Fe in the matrix. Finally, high spatial resolution is
required to identify if the Fe is present in nanoparticulate form,
if it is present only at the surface, and if there is any morphological
effect of Fe on the zeolite crystallites.

We therefore studied
an individual FCC catalyst particle cross-section
using chemical mapping with soft X-ray ptychography, to investigate
the chemistry and deposition profile of Fe in an ECAT FCC catalyst.
The catalyst was of the same type as the one we have studied in our
previous work using lower-resolution X-ray nanotomography.11 Ptychography data were collected at beamline
5.3.2.1 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
on a FCC particle cross section sliced to a thickness of 500 nm. Scanning
transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) data were initially recorded
at 700 eV to identify a 7 μm × 7 μm region of interest
(ROI) for elemental mapping using ptychography. Ptychography data
were also collected over a 3 × 3 μm field of view for NEXAFS
analysis at the Fe L3 edge. Figure 1 shows the identification of the ROIs with
STXM (A,B) and the higher-resolution ptychography (C,D).

Figure 1 Scanning transmission
X-ray microscopy image of individual ECAT
FCC particle cross sections (A,B), recorded at 700 eV, showing the
region of interest selected for ptychography. Ptychography data were
collected over the region shown in (C) for elemental mapping of Fe
and La. The ROI was reduced to the region shown in (D) for NEXAFS
analysis, recording a series of images across the Fe L3 X-ray absorption edge. All data were collected using a beam footprint
of 100 nm on the sample.

Ptychography data were collected over the same 7 μm
×
7 μm region (Figure 1C) using X-ray energies around the Fe L3 edge (704,
708, and 710 eV) and the La M5 edge (830 and 834.5 eV)
to create a map of La and Fe distributions in the particle as shown
in Figure 2. Conservative
estimates (determined as detailed in the Supporting Information) indicate that the ptychography images have resolutions
of 12.2–14.2 nm. La was used as a marker for the La-exchanged
USY-zeolite crystallites, which can be seen distributed throughout
the particle. Fe is present in low concentrations in the center of
the particle as a constituent of the matrix (kaolin clay), whereas
much higher concentrations of Fe are seen in the surface region of
the particle, which is in agreement with our previous studies of ECAT
particles.5,9−11

particle derived from ptychography data collected at the Fe L3 and La M5 absorption edges. Circles highlight

Enlarged view on the corresponding encircled areas.

The capability to map both Fe and La distributions
at the nanoscale
allowed us to observe for the first time that the Fe enrichment around
the edge of the particle is occurring in zones that actually contain
La domains (Figure 2). This means that Fe is not only deposited on the surface, increasing
the size of the particle (“particle swelling” by deposition
of colloidal Fe5), but also clearly penetrates
into the original particle matrix containing the zeolites. Using the
distribution of Fe as a marker for the penetration of these large
organic molecules, we see that most of the precracking occurs in the
first ∼1 μm of the surface of the FCC particle. This
shows that the permeability for such large molecules is small, likely
due to the higher density of the particle crust limiting accessibility
for these molecules. Furthermore, as a result of the high spatial
resolution of the data, evidence for particulate Fe can be seen in
the very surface of the particle, highlighted by the zoomed areas
in Figure 2 (and Figure S2). These observations provide the first
clear evidence for both proposed Fe deposition mechanisms, namely,
deposition of inorganic particulate Fe known as “tramp Fe”,
“colloidal Fe”, or “fine dust Fe”, and
accumulation of Fe through the precracking of large Fe transporting
porphyrin and/or naphthenate molecules in the matrix. As shown in
our previous work, this deposition of Fe at and near the surface leads
to the reduction in catalyst activity due to pore clogging.5

Previous reports have observed vitrification
as a result of Fe
contamination especially in combination with Ca or Na.25,26,29 In our previous work, we have
confirmed the correlation of Fe and Ca particularly at the surface
in these ECAT particles using lower-resolution XRF tomography.9 While vitrification is not directly observed
here, the change in texture visible in the regions where particulate
Fe is seen, along with the overall degree of Fe contamination, suggests
that vitrification of the surface is likely to have occurred, thus
supporting the theory that Fe and Ca can lower the melting point of
the matrix resulting in significant pore blocking due to vitrificaton.

The distribution map of La and Fe (Figure 2) was further analyzed to estimate the particle
size distribution of zeolites as shown in Figure 3 (details provided in the Supporting Information). The particle sizes obtained from
this analysis vary from 0.1 to 3 μm2. Owing to the
high resolution of these ptychographic images, it can be seen that
some zeolite domains are conjoined—a detail which would be
lost with lower resolution imaging methods and which paves the way
for detailed analysis of the degradation of the zeolite domains themselves.
It further confirms that a sample preparation resulting in thicker
cross sections is preferred to minimize damage to zeolite crystallites.

Discrete particles are indicated by different colors (inset) for the
La particles seen in red in Figure 2.

To investigate the chemical
state of Fe within the particle, ptychography
images of a 3 μm × 3 μm area were collected at 41
energies over the Fe L3 absorption edge (700–720.5
eV) to generate per pixel NEXAFS data. Principle component analysis
(PCA) and subsequent clustering (see SI) were used to define the distribution of different Fe chemical states
without using a priori knowledge about the Fe phases
that are present (Figure 4). The resulting image segmentation clearly shows that the
Fe phase correlates with Fe concentration and that the surface-deposited
Fe is of a different phase than the Fe in deeper regions (i.e., in
the matrix).

Figure 4 La (red) and Fe (green) distribution map (A) and cluster
map (B)
generated from principal component analysis and clustering of the
per pixel NEXAFS data. In (C), the average NEXAFS of each generated
cluster are reported showing clear differences in Fe phase. The arrow
in (B) highlights the crack visible in the surface layer.

Based on the inspection of the average NEXAFS of
each cluster (Figure 4C), the distribution
of the Fe phases shows a more reduced state in the matrix (dark and
light blue) and a sandwich structure of more oxidized states in the
surface layer (following the order from green to purple to yellow).
Here it is interesting to point out what seems to be a crack in the
surface layer (indicated by the arrow in Figure 4B) that interrupts this sandwich structure
of the Fe phase distribution, which could relate to a reduction process
occurring following deposition. Such a postdeposition reduction would
also explain the layer of more reduced Fe at the very surface of the
particle. Finally, as shown in Figure 4A,B, zeolite domains are present very near to the surface
of the particle, which seem to hinder Fe transport into the particle
and cause Fe to accumulate on the surface.

In addition to PCA,
linear combination fitting (LCF) was carried
out to determine the oxidation state of the Fe species present in
the sample. FeO (Fe2+) and Fe2O3 (Fe3+) reference spectra were used as standards for the fitting,
with the resulting intensity and distribution maps of the different
oxidation states shown in Figure 5.30 A clear separation is
seen between the chemistries of the Fe present in the original matrix
and the Fe deposited at the surface. Previous studies have used XPS
or electron diffraction to identify the iron species present at the
surface as Fe2O3, in agreement with our analysis.27 However, this is the first time it has been
possible to map and discriminate the Fe chemical state both at the
surface and in the body of the particle. The intensity of the signal
suggests that the Fe concentration at the surface is at least 5×
greater than in the catalyst particle body. Previously, it was shown
that the mobility of Fe2+ in feldspars (other aluminosilicates)
can be 10× higher than that of Fe3+.31 This suggests that the accumulation of Fe at the surface
is related to the chemical nature of Fe that is deposited. Once accumulated
and immobile, particle swelling effects are exacerbated and catalyst
accessibility is lowered further. Enhanced concentrations of Fe at
the surface have also been attributed to agglutination of FCC particles
resulting in further detrimental effects on catalyst performance during
operation.10

Figure 5 Intensity maps of Fe3+ (A) and Fe2+ (B) determined
by LCF of the per-pixel NEXAFS data. Intensity maps were rescaled
and combined to map the relative distributions of Fe3+ (green)
and Fe2+ (blue) (C). NEXAFS spectra and a map of R2 values are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S9 and S10).

Using soft X-ray ptychography, we found direct
evidence that Fe
deposition is occurring as a result of both “tramp”
Fe and due to precracking of large, iron-carrying organic molecules,
with the deposited iron in a different chemical state (i.e., Fe3+) than the iron present in the matrix (i.e., Fe2+). The high resolution attainable with ptychography combined with
the large field of view and relatively thick sample has enabled the
detailed analysis of the nature of Fe poisoning in an industrial FCC
catalyst particle that is not obtainable with other techniques.
