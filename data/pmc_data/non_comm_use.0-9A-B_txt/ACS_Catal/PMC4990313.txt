The application of biocatalysis for the asymmetric reduction
of
activated C=C is a powerful tool for the manufacture of high-value
chemical commodities. The biocatalytic potential of “-ene”
reductases from the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family of oxidoreductases
is well-known; however, the specificity of these enzymes toward mainly
small molecule substrates has highlighted the need to discover “-ene”
reductases from different enzymatic classes to broaden industrial
applicability. Here, we describe the characterization of a flavin-free
double bond reductase from Nicotiana tabacum (NtDBR), which belongs to the leukotriene B4 dehydrogenase
(LTD) subfamily of the zinc-independent, medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase
superfamily of enzymes. Using steady-state kinetics and biotransformation
reactions, we have demonstrated the regio- and stereospecificity of
NtDBR against a variety of α,β-unsaturated activated alkenes.
In addition to catalyzing the reduction of typical LTD substrates
and several classical OYE-like substrates, NtDBR also exhibited complementary
activity by reducing non-OYE substrates (i.e., reducing the exocyclic
C=C double bond of (R)-pulegone) and in some
cases showing an opposite stereopreference in comparison with the
OYE family member pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase. This
serves to augment classical OYE “-ene” reductase activity
and, coupled with its aerobic stability, emphasizes the potential
industrial value of NtDBR. Furthermore, we also report the X-ray crystal
structures of the holo-, binary NADP(H)-bound, and ternary [NADP+ and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde (9a)-bound]
NtDBR complexes. These will underpin structure-driven site-saturated
mutagenesis studies aimed at enhancing the reactivity, stereochemistry,
and specificity of this enzyme.

Introduction
The intelligent use of enzymes for the
production of high-value
fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemical intermediates is
at the forefront of the drive toward the use of mild and ecologically
sustainable manufacturing techniques.1 This
is largely due to the unmatched chemo-, regio-, and stereospecificity
that can be achieved when using enzyme-catalyzed reactions with either
whole cell preparations or purified enzymes.1c,2 The
biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of activated C=C bonds has
received particular attention because of the potential for production
of chiral compounds with up to two new stereogenic centers.3 Recent work has demonstrated the biocatalytic
potential of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE; E.C. 1.6.99.1) family of
oxidoreductases in the reduction of activated α,β-unsaturated
alkenes, including α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones,
nitroalkenes, and carboxylic acids.3,4 These FMN-containing,
NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases are an exceptionally versatile group
of biocatalysts and offer considerable potential for exploitation
in industrial biocatalysis; however, the substrate specificity of
these enzymes is generally confined to small molecules, which limits
the scope of their applicability. This highlights the importance of
targeting “-ene” reductases from different enzymatic
classes, which could potentially reduce alkene substrates that are
not acted upon by OYEs because there is likely to be a significantly
altered substrate binding site.

A potential source for “-ene”
reductases may exist
in the zinc-independent, medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR)
superfamily, or more specifically, the leukotriene B4 dehydrogenase
(LTD, MDR002) subfamily.5 This subclass
of enzymes do not contain any bound coenzyme and have been shown to
catalyze the reduction of the C=C double bonds of α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids.6 For example, phenylpropenal double bond reductase (PtPPDBR) from Pinus taeda catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction
of the α,β-unsaturated bond of phenylpropenal aldehydes
(Scheme 1a).7 A
similar alkenal double bond reductase (At5g16970) was discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana, which reduces the C7–8
alkene group of p-coumaryl- and coniferyl aldehydes
(Scheme 1a) and 4-hydroxy-(2E)-nonenal (4-HNE) (Scheme 1b).6 In rat liver, the detoxification of 4-HNE is catalyzed
by the NAD(P)H-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase (AOR) to form
4-hydroxynonanal (4-HNA; Scheme 1b).8 In humans, 4-HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation
and can lead to apoptosis, affect cell signaling pathways, and form
4-HNE-protein adducts found in Alzheimer plaques.6

A BLAST search of LTD subfamily members identified
a putative double
bond reductase from Nicotiana tabacum (NtDBR). This enzyme has a high amino acid sequence identity to
other LTD members: At5g16970 (71%),6 2-alkenal
reductase (Dbr1) from Artemisia annua (67%),10 (+)-pulegone reductase (PulR)
from Mentha piperita (66%),11 and PPDBR (41%).7 This enzyme was originally misclassified as an NAD+-dependent
allyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (NtADH) because the enzyme isolated from
tobacco leaves showed alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity toward
carveol.12 However, this activity was absent
in the recombinant form of the enzyme and purported to be due to the
absence of suitable post-translational modification capabilities of
the host Escherichia coli.9 NtDBR was later described as a pulegone reductase
because of its ability to hydrogenate the exocyclic C=C bond
of (R)- and (S)-pulegone to produce
menthone and isomenthone isomers (Scheme 1c).13 In light of the moderate yields achieved for
the latter conversion, we have chosen to refer to the enzyme as a
generalized double bond reductase (NtDBR). Because menthone and isomenthone
have important industrial applications in the production of synthetic
peppermint oils and bases, we decided to further investigate the biocatalytic
potential of recombinant NtDBR. This paper describes our kinetic characterization
of the substrate and cofactor specificity of NtDBR and determination
of its regio- and stereospecificity toward typical LTD alkenal/one
substrates and commercially useful compounds. We also determined the
crystal structure of NtDBR both in isolation (holo) and in complexes
with NADP(H) (binary) ± alkene substrate 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde
(HMCA) (ternary). This enables us to expand our understanding of the
catalytic mechanism and substrate binding modes and drive future structure-driven
site-saturated mutagenesis studies to further expand the biocatalytic
potential of this enzyme.

Experimental Section
Gene Synthesis and Cloning
The protein sequence for
the allyl alcohol dehydrogenase (accession number: Q9SLN8) from N. tabacum was obtained from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org). The gene sequence was designed and synthesized by GenScript (USA),
incorporating codon optimization techniques of rare codon removal
for optimal expression in E. coli.
The gene was cloned into pET21b (Novagen) via NdeI/XhoI restriction sites, without a stop codon,
to incorporate a C-terminal His6-tag. The construct was
transformed into the E. coli strain
BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene) for soluble protein overexpression according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Enzyme Production and Purification
The NtDBR construct
was grown in Terrific broth medium (ForMedium) containing glycerol
(0.4%), ampicillin (100 μg mL–1), and chloramphenicol
(34 μg mL–1). Cultures were incubated at 37
°C until OD600 nm reached 0.5, followed by a
16 h induction with isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG; 10 μM) at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 5000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) containing the EDTA-free
complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), DNase I (0.1 mg mL–1), and lysozyme (1 mg mL–1) and
stirred for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication
(Sonics Vibra Cell), followed by extract clarification by centrifugation
for 60 min at 26 600g.

The supernatant
was filtered (0.2 μm) and applied to a Ni2+ Sepharose
high-performance column (40 mL; GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in
buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole,
and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with five column volumes
of buffer A, followed by a step elution of NtDBR into buffer B (50
mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, and 10%
glycerol). The enzyme was dialyzed against buffer C (50 mM Tris, pH
8.0, containing 10% glycerol) and reapplied to the Ni2+ Sepharose column, preequilibrated as before. The column was washed
as above, and the enzyme was eluted in a linear gradient (300 mL)
to buffer D (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole,
and 10% glycerol). The enzyme was dialyzed against buffer C as above,
concentrated by ultrafiltration, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
for storage at −80 °C. Purity was assessed by SDS–PAGE,
and the concentration was determined using the Bradford and extinction
coefficient methods (ε205 = 30.86 mg mL–1).14

Crystallogenesis and Data Collection
Crystals of the
C-terminally His6-tagged NtDBR were obtained by sitting
drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C after a period of 7 days of incubation.
Drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes (2 μL) of mother
liquor (100 mM KH2PO4/citrate buffer, pH 4.0–5.0,
containing PEG 300 (35–50%)) and NtDBR (25 mg mL–1 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.0). Crystals of the holoenzyme were flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen in the absence of any additional cryoprotectant.
Additional crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing (A) NADPH
or (B) NADP+ and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde to form
the binary and ternary complexes, respectively. All ligand concentrations
were at half saturation, and crystals were flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen in the absence of any additional cryoprotectant. Full holo-NtDBR
(1.94 Å), binary-NtDBR (1.9 Å), and ternary-NtDBR (2.1 Å)
X-ray diffraction data sets were collected from single crystals at
the Diamond Light Source (Oxford, UK).

Structure Determination and Refinement
Data were processed
and scaled using the programs MOSFLM15 and
Scala.16 The structures were solved via
molecular replacement using the program MolRep16 and the coordinates for a Swiss-MODEL-generated pdb file
of NtDBR (http://swissmodel.expasy.org). This model was
generated on the basis of the known three-dimensional structure of Arabidopsis alkenal double bond reductase At5g16970
(PDB 2J3H).6 Positional, TLS (two domains per monomer), and
isotropic B-factor refinement was performed using REFMAC5,17 with alternate rounds of manual rebuilding of
the model and water addition in COOT.16 Data and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. The atomic coordinates and structure factors (codes: 4HFJ, 4HFM and 4HFN, for the holo, binary,
and ternary structures, respectively) have been deposited in the Protein
Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/). The
interactions involved in the dimeric interfaces were analyzed by the
protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies service PISA at the European
Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msdsrv/prot_int/pistart.html).18

Steady-State Kinetics
Steady-state kinetic analysis
was performed on a Cary UV-50 Bio UV/vis scanning spectrophotometer
using a quartz cuvette (1 mL; Hellma) with a 1 cm path length. Reactions
(1 mL) were performed in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4) containing NADPH
(0.1 mM), alkene (1 mM added as concentrated stocks in ethanol to
a final concentration of 5%) and enzyme (10 nM–4 μM).
Reactions were followed continuously by monitoring NADPH oxidation
at 340 nm (ε340 = 6220 M–1 cm–1) for 1 min at 25 °C. Reactions with alkenes
that absorb at 340 nm were monitored at 365 nm (ε365 = 3256 M–1 cm–1). Standard units
of activity (1 μmol NADPH min–1 mg–1 NtDBR after protein purification) were determined in buffer (50
mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 5.4)
containing 100 μM NADPH and 500 μM 1-nitrocyclohexene
at 25 °C. Typical batches contained 2.01–2.47 U/mg enzyme.
All comparative reactions were performed using the same enzyme batch.
To determine the optimal reaction conditions and steady-state reaction
parameters (kcat, Km, and Ki), the reaction pH (5.0–7.4),
buffer (KH2PO4/K2HPO4 or
KH2PO4/K2HPO4/citrate),
enzyme (10 nM–4 μM), and substrate concentrations (10
μM–10 mM) were varied. In cases that reaction constraints
prevented a full steady-state analysis, the specificity factor (kcat/Km) was determined
from the initial Michaelis–Menten slope. Substrate concentrations
were mostly determined using their respective extinction coefficients
previously described,19 or as follows: trans-2-nonenal (ε227 = 15 600 M–1 cm–1), 1-octen-3-one (ε214 = 8500 M–1 cm–1), methyl
crotonate (ε210 = 12 500 M–1 cm–1), (R)-pulegone (ε263 = 6310 M–1cm–1).

Biotransformation with NtDBR
All reagents were of analytical
grade. The alkenes were dissolved as stock solutions in ethanol, then
diluted to 5 mM in the reactions (2% final solvent concentration).
(i) Standard biotransformations: Standard reactions (1.0 mL) were
performed aerobically in phosphate buffer (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 pH 6.4) containing alkene (5
mM), NtDBR (2.0 μM), NADP+ (10 μM), glucose
(15 mM), and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH; 10 U). The reactions were
shaken at 30 °C for 4 or 24 h at 130 rpm, and terminated by extraction
with ethyl acetate (0.9 mL) containing an internal standard. The extracts
were dried using anhydrous MgSO4 and analyzed by GC to
determine the percent yield, percent conversion, and enantiomeric
excess. Products were identified by comparison with authentic standards.
(ii) Effect of pH: Reactions were performed as described for the standard
biotransformations, except a variety of buffer compositions and final
pH values were used (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.0–7.4; or 50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4/citrate, pH 5.4–6.0).
(iii) Reduction of (5R)-pulegone in the presence
of auxiliaries: Reactions (1.0 mL) were performed as described under
the standard biotransformations conditions with the addition of Triton
X-100 (0.01% or 0.1%) ± BSA (15 μM) or in the presence
of BSA (15 μM) alone. (iv) Biotransformations with PETN reductase:
PETN reductase was produced and purified as described previously.20 Reactions (1.0 mL) were performed anaerobically
in buffer (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 pH 7.0) containing PETN reductase (2.0 μM). Reactions
were set up within an anaerobic glovebox (Belle Technology Ltd.) under
a nitrogen atmosphere (<5 ppm oxygen) using anaerobic solvents.
Prior to addition, PETN reductase was deoxygenated by passage through
a BioRad 10DG column equilibrated in anaerobic reaction buffer. All
other details were the same as those described under the standard
biotransformation conditions.

Results and Discussion
Substrate Specificity of NtDBR
The activity of NtDBR
toward a variety of activated alkenes was determined under steady-state
conditions (Table 1). Surprisingly, the pH
optimum was found to be 5.4 with 1-nitrocyclohexene (1a) (Supporting Information Figure S1),
in contrast to prior reported reaction conditions of pH 7–8.9,12,13 Given that typical biotransformation
reactions proceed around neutral pH, we determined the steady-state
kinetic parameters of NtDBR at both pH 5.4 and 7.3 (Table 1). In many cases, full steady-state kinetic parameters
could not be determined because of either limited alkene solubility
(trans-2-nonenal, 4a), significant alkene
absorbance at 340/365 nm at higher substrate concentrations [1a and trans-cinnamaldehyde (6a)], or the detection of near-zero-order kinetics with respect to
substrate concentration down to 10–20 μM [1-octen-3-one
(5a) and NADPH at pH 7.3]. In these cases, either the
specificity factor (kcat/Km) or the rate with 1 mM alkene was determined (Table 1).

NtDBR showed a higher preference for NADPH
as the hydride donor13 compared with NADH
(>1600-fold). This is not surprising, given the significant number
of specific interactions observed between the enzyme and the adenosyl
phosphate group in the binary and tertiary structures (vide infra:
Structural Analysis of NtDBR) (Figure 2B).
This preference for NADPH was also seen with Dbr110 and rat AOR21 and may be a common
feature of LTD enzymes. Although full steady-state parameters could
not be determined for some substrates, NtDBR shows a high preference
for 1-nitrocyclohexene (1a) over typical LTD alkenal/one
substrates (Table 1). However, significant
activity was detected with alkenals: 2-methylpentenal (2a) and trans-cinnamaldehyde (6a) at
pH 5.4 (kcat/Km = 8.9 and 2.8, respectively), although the Km is predicted to be higher (millimolar range) than with 1a. In contrast, the Km values
with AOR-like substrates trans-2-nonenal (4a) and 1-octen-3-one (5a) are predicted to be in the
low micromolar range, similar to NADPH binding (results not shown).
They showed reaction rates (0.87 ± 0.07 and 0.52 ± 0.03
s–1, respectively) similar to 2a and 6a (0.36 ± 0.02 and 0.80 ± 0.03 s–1, respectively) at pH 7.3. In addition, substrate inhibition was
seen with 2a (apparent Ki = 2.6 ± 0.6 mM) and 5a, although only at pH 5.4.

NtDBR with a Variety of Substratesa

Alkenes not reduced by NtDBR under steady-state conditions were methyl
α-methyl-trans-cinnamate, methyl trans-cinnamate, trans-cinnamonitrile, trans-cinnamic acid, trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, 2-cyclohexenone,
3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one, 1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid, 1-cyclohexene-1-carbonitrile,
2-cyclohexen-1-ol, 2-cyclopenten-1-one, 2-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one,
3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one, 3-methyl-2-butenal, citral, (5R)- and (5S)-carvone, ketoisophorone, isophorone,
2-methylmaleimide, N-phenyl-2-methylmaleimide, itaconic
acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid, crotonitrile, (S)-perillyl alcohol, and β-bromostyrene.

1 Reactions were performed in the
presence of 500 μM nitrocyclohexene, which is below the expected Km for this substrate.

2 Estimated kinetic parameters are
based on fits of partial Michaelis–Menten plots due to substrate
concentration range limitations.

NtDBR is predicted to display tight binding with 4a and 5a (zero-order kinetics down to 10 μM
substrate;
results not shown); therefore, it is likely to be specific for long
chain fatty alkenals/ones. LTD family members commonly reduce the
substrate 4a, displaying tight binding kinetics, high
rates, or both. For example, At5g16970 showed both a high catalytic
rate (kcat = 51 s–1)
and apparent tight binding (Km = 5.9 μM)
toward 4a.22 In contrast,
enzymes Dbr1 and AOR showed apparent tight binding (Km = 6.4/77.6 μM), but slower reaction rates (kcat = <1/0.2 s–1) with 4a.10,21

A comparison of the kinetic
parameters of NtDBR at pH 5.4 vs 7.3
shows an interesting trend of a decrease in both the catalytic rate
and Km with increasing pH (Table 1). This trend could possibly be due to a change
in the position of the substrates α,β-unsaturated bond
relative to the NADPH pro-4R hydrogen
at neutral pH, resulting in a tighter-binding, yet less favored enzyme–substrate
complex. Alternatively, the change in the overall rate may be due
to a decrease in the product(s) KD, dissociation
rates, or both. Further, fast reaction kinetics studies are required
to determine the mechanism of the pH effects on the overall reaction
kinetics.

Minor activity (<0.1 s–1) was
seen under standard
steady-state conditions with alkene substrates: α-methyl trans-cinnamaldehyde, 1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde, methyl
crotonate, (R)-pulegone, and dimethyl itaconate.
No reduction was seen with other activated alkenes, such as maleimides,
citral, (5R)- or (5S)-carvone, (S)-perillyl alcohol, and substituted cyclohexenones and
cyclopentenones (see Table 1 footnote for full
list). The poor reactivity with (R)-pulegone was
unexpected, given the detection of significant activity in prior studies
by others (kcat = 3.3 s–1, Km = 1.4 mM);9 however, the earlier studies were carried out under biotransformation
conditions (pH 7.0, 3 mM NADPH, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100),
and the presence of Triton-X-100 is known to dramatically enhance
the catalytic rate of NtDBR.13 In addition,
previous comparative studies of alkene reduction by pentaerythritol
tetranitrate reductase and thermostable Old Yellow Enzyme (TOYE) showed
that significant alkane product could be detected in biotransformations
with substrates poorly reduced under steady-state conditions.19a,23 Therefore, longer biotransformation reactions (24 h; 5 mM alkene)
allow a more comprehensive investigation of the substrate range of
alkene reduction.

Structure Analysis of NtDBR
We determined the X-ray
crystal structures of the holo-, binary (NADP(H)-bound), and ternary
(NADP+ and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde-bound) NtDBR
complexes. The data collection and refinement statistics can be found
in Table 2. The
asymmetric unit of each structure contains two protein molecules,
related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (C2 symmetry). The overall structure of NtDBR exhibits a typical
MDR-like protein fold (Figure 1A), arranged
as a functional homodimer (Figure 1B).24 Each monomer is composed of two domains (Figure 1A): a substrate binding or catalytic domain (residues
1–135 and 304–343) and a nucleotide-binding domain (residues
136–303). The catalytic domain contains three α-helices
and eight β-strands, with the majority of the β-strands
forming a twisted partial β-barrel-like structure, as seen in
At5g16970 structures (Figure 1C).6 In contrast, the nucleotide-binding domain contains
a typical alternating pattern of α-helices (αA-αG)
and β-strands (βA-βF), forming a Rossman fold seen
in many nucleotide-binding enzyme structures. The active site is formed
in a groove located at the interface of the two domains, with a minor
contribution of residues from the neighboring monomer.

Using
the program DALILITE,25 each of the three
structures was shown to be virtually identical (rmsd of 0.5–1.0
Å) with Z scores of 49.6–54.5 (331 residues
aligned by Cα). NtDBR is also very similar to the structure
of another LTD subfamily member At5g16970 (rmsd of 0.8–1.1
Å; Z score = 47.4–50.8).6 Further details of the subtle differences among the three
NtDBR structures and At5g16970 can be found in the Supporting Information.

Dimeric Interface
The dimeric interface is composed
of residues located in the nucleotide-binding region (αE-βF)
of each subunit (Figure 1C; Supporting Information Table 2). These secondary structure
elements are oriented antiparallel with respect to each monomer chain,
particularly in the case of strand βF (Figure 1A and 2B).
This gives the appearance of an extended β-sheet across the
dimer interface, similar to the At5g16970 structure.6 An analysis of the dimeric interface of each structure
gave complex formation significance scores (CSS) of 0.5–1.0,
with interface areas of 1019–1058 Å2. This
is indicative of a functional interaction,18 consistent with the observation that wild-type and recombinant NtDBR
exist as a homodimer in vitro.9,12

The interactions
within the dimeric interface are composed of mainly hydrogen bonds
between backbone (e.g., G281 N–I277 O) or side chain atoms
(e.g., H267 ND1–263 OG1; Supporting Information Table 1). In some cases, pairs of the same residues of each subunit
interact via backbone N and O atoms (V266 and M279). Salt bridges
also play a role in the interface, with multiple interactions seen
between residues R276 and D286 of each subunit (Supporting Information Table 1). Residues E280 (OE2) and R276
(O) of subunits A and B, respectively, also interact via the presence
of a bridging water molecule. Interestingly, the βF region (residues
277–286) in LTD enzymes is known to be involved in NADP(H)
binding (Figure 2A),6 suggesting the dimeric state may be important for either substrate
binding, enzyme activity, or both.

NADP(H)-Binding Site
Both the binary and ternary crystal
structures showed clear |Fo| –
|Fc| electron density for the NADP(H)
(Figure 2B). The cofactor binds in the cleft
joining the catalytic and nucleotide-binding domains in an extended
conformation (Figure 1), similar to other LTD
enzymes. In the holoenzyme, this cleft is filled with water molecules,
and the backbone positions of surface regions α1 and β7-α3
surrounding the NADP(H) binding site are slightly altered in position
compared with the binary and ternary structures. The side chain positions
of residues Y206, N332, and S136 are significantly different between
the holoenzyme and the NADP(H)-bound structures. In the case of S136,
this is to prevent a clash of this residue with the nicotinamide moiety
of NADP(H).

and blue carbons for subunits A and B, respectively. NADP+ and HMCA/4-HNE are shown as atom-colored sticks with yellow and

behind the atoms shown).

The position and orientation of NADP(H) in subunit
A of the binary
and ternary structures are virtually identical. In contrast, the mode
of NADP(H) binding in subunit B of the binary complex differs significantly
because of a reorienting of atoms O5B and C5B of the adenosine moiety
(Figure 2B). The position of the nicotinamide
moiety in these structures and the At5g16970 binary and ternary complexes
is highly conserved;6 however, the orientation
of the remaining cofactor atoms can vary significantly between subunits
and between enzymes. In the case of the At5g16970 ternary complex,
the cofactor reorients beginning at the d-ribose moiety relative
to NtDBR, although the positions of the terminal adenine base and
phosphate group are similar in both structures.6 Further details about the more subtle differences in the
NADP(H) binding can be found in the Supporting
Information.

Ternary Complex
The crystal structure of NtDBR in the
presence of the alkene substrate derivative 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde
(HMCA) and product NADP+ showed clear |Fo| – |Fc| electron
density for the presence of NADP+ and a second ligand in
subunit A only (Figure 2C, D); however, the
electron density for the putative propenal ring substituent of HMCA
was partially disordered and nonplanar with respect to the aromatic
ring. The close proximity of the side chain of L283 to the propenal
group of HMCA may be causing it to be oriented in a less favored nonplanar
conformation. Alternatively, the second ligand could potentially be
the alkane product derivative 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyhydrocinnamaldehyde
(HMHCA), with substrate hydrogenation occurring via X-ray exposure
during data collection. Therefore, we are unable to ascertain the
exact nature of the second ligand and have modeled in HMCA because
this was the compound soaked into the crystals.

Unfortunately,
we cannot directly infer the likely active binding mode of HMCA because
the substrate/product is bound in an orientation with the propanal
group at the protein surface, distal from the NADP+ nicotinamide
moiety (Figure 2C). Therefore, the ternary
complex is likely an inhibitory complex, although the position of
HMHCA aids us in determining which residues are likely to be involved
in forming the alkene substrate binding pocket. In contrast to NADP(H)
binding, there are no hydrogen bonds between HMHCA and the protein.
This is consistent with the observation that there is little change
in the position of residues lining the alkene-binding pocket between
the structures, with the exception of mobile surface residues F285
and E29. Instead, there are direct polar interactions between the
4-OH group (O11) of HMHCA and both the N1N and O2D atoms of NADP+ (Figure 2C; Supporting
Information Table 3). These interactions are likely responsible
for the orientation of HMHCA in an inhibitory complex. The binding
pocket contains six hydrophobic residues within van der Waals distance
of HMHCA, including two conserved NADP(H)-binding residues (Y55 and
Y258), and two nonconserved residues from subunit B (F270 and I273).

A superimposition of the ternary structures of NtDBR and At5g16970
(NADP+ and p-coumaryl aldehyde (PCA) or
4-HNE) showed significant differences in the second ligand binding
positions (Figure 2D). This is due to the binding
of PCA and 4-HNE in a likely active conformation to At5g16970. A comparison
of the residues lining the alkene-binding site in both structures
shows a high conservation in sequence identity and residue position
in most cases. Notable exceptions include two phenylalanine-to-serine
substitutions (NtDBR to At5g16970; 285/287 and 270/272), which effectively
introduce additional polar residues into the latter enzyme. In the
case of F285, this residue clashes with PCA and would likely have
to reorient to allow the binding of cinnamaldehyde-like substrates
in an active conformation. Therefore, the presence of two additional
phenylalanine residues may restrict the size of the binding pocket
and impact on the enzyme substrate specificity. Further site-directed
mutagenesis work is required to confirm the mechanistic role(s) of
individual residues in substrate binding and catalysis and confirm
whether the dimeric form is required for catalysis.

Biotransformations with NtDBR
To fully evaluate the
biocatalytic potential of NtDBR and gain an insight into the stereochemical
outcome of these reactions, we studied the reduction of a variety
of compounds with different activating groups and substitution patterns
under biotransformation conditions. Under steady-state conditions,
a decrease in both the catalytic rate and Km was observed with increasing pH (Table 1);
therefore, we studied the overall effect of pH on the NtDBR-catalyzed
reduction under biotransformation conditions. In addition, changes
in pH have also been shown to influence the enantiopurity of products
that are subject to racemization under the reaction conditions.19a The assays were performed aerobically against
two representative substrates, 1-nitrocyclohexene (1a) and methyl-trans-2-methylcinnamaldehyde (3a) (5 mM substrate; 2 μM NtDBR), for 4 and 24 h at
pH 5.4, 6.4, and 7.4 using a NADP+/glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) cofactor recycling system as the source of reducing equivalents
(Table 3).

Table 3 Influence of pH on the Reduction of 1a and 3a by NtDBRa
a Conditions: reactions (1 mL) were
performed aerobically in buffer (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.4 and 6.4; or 50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4/citrate, pH 5.4) containing
alkene (5 mM), NtDBR (2 μM), NADP+ (10 μM),
glucose (15 mM) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH; 10 U). The reactions
were agitated at 30 °C for 4 or 24 h at 130 rpm. Conversion (conv)
and yields were determined by GC analysis on a DB-WAX column. The
alkenes were added from stock solutions in ethanol (2% final solvent
concentration in the reactions). The product obtained during the reduction
of 3a was near racemic in all cases.

The reduction of 1-nitrocyclohexene (1a) proceeded
efficiently at both pH 5.4 and 6.4, with complete conversion of the
substrate observed after 4 h; however, at pH 7.4, the reduction was
significantly slower and had failed to reach completion after 24 h,
consistent with the rates observed under steady-state conditions (see
above). Furthermore, poor product yields were observed at pH 7.4,
despite apparent high substrate consumption, indicating decomposition
of substrate, product, or both. In contrast, the reduction of methyl-trans-cinnamaldehyde (3a) was most efficient
at pH 6.4 and 7.4, with almost identical results obtained at both
pH values. Changes in pH did not influence the stereochemical outcome,
as near-racemic product was obtained at all pH values. Therefore,
the optimum pH for reduction was considered to be pH 6.4, and all
further assays were performed at this pH.

NtDBR proved to be
highly efficient in the reduction of several
typical LTD-like substrates: 2-methylpentenal (2a), 1-octen-3-one
(5a), and trans-cinnamaldehyde (6a), all of which were completely reduced after 4 h (Table 4). In contrast, 1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde (7a) and citral (8a) were reduced with moderate
and low yields, respectively. In terms of stereoselectivity, the reduction
of citral 8a [the citral used here was a mixture of geranial
(E)-8a and neral (Z)-8a in ∼65:35 ratio] is complicated by isomerization
of this substrate between its E/Z forms under the reaction conditions.19a Some reduction of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde (9a) was observed, despite the apparent inhibitory binding conformation
observed in the tertiary crystal structure (Figure 2C). This suggests that more than one binding conformations
may exist for this ligand.

Table 4 Reduction of Various Activated Alkenes
by NtDBR Using an NADP+/GDH Cofactor Recycling Systema
a Conditions: reactions (1 mL) were
performed aerobically in buffer (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.4) containing alkene (5 mM),
NtDBR (2 μM), NADP+ (10 μM), glucose (15 mM),
and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH; 10 U). The reactions were agitated
at 30 °C for 4 or 24 h at 130 rpm. The alkenes were added from
stock solutions in ethanol (2% final solvent concentration in the
reactions).

b Conversion (conv)
and yields were
determined by GC analysis using a DB-WAX column.

c By chiral GC.

d Total yield of diastereoisomers
[(2S, 5R)-menthone and (2R, 5R)-isomenthone]

e By GC analysis using a Rtx-5 ms
column. NtDBR did not catalyze the reduction of the following substrates:
methyl trans-cinnamate, dimethyl itaconate, methyl
crotonate, (S)-perillyl alcohol, (5R)- and (5S)-carvone, and 2-methylmaleimide.

The reduction of the E and Z isomers
of 2-phenyl-1-nitroprop-1-ene (10a) proceeded with an
opposite stereochemical outcome: the reduction of (E)-10a furnished the R product in optically
pure form, whereas the reduction of (Z)-10a generated the S product with poor enantioselectivity
(Table 4). This is in contrast to our previous
observations with the Old Yellow Enzyme, PETN reductase, which furnished
the same S enantiomer from the reduction of both
(E)- and (Z)-10a with
moderate and high optical purity, respectively.19a In the case of PETN reductase, this was attributed to multiple
substrate binding conformations for (E)-10a, with the preference for the S product under anaerobic
conditions.19a,20 Therefore, it is likely that
in NtDBR, the E and Z isomers bind
predominantly in the same conformation, leading to an enantiodivergent
outcome. The lower ee values obtained from the reduction of (Z)-10a may originate from isomerization between
the E/Z forms or a second, less
favored, binding conformation of the Z isomer in
the NtDBR active site. Significantly, we are now able to generate
both enantiomers of 10b in optically pure form by using
either PETN reductase or NtDBR, eloquently highlighting the potential
of this enzyme as a complementary biocatalytic tool to classical OYE
“-ene” reductases. The related 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane
(11b) was also obtained under the reaction conditions,
albeit in racemic form. The low enantiopurity of 11b and
other products possessing a stereogenic center at the Cα position
(2–3b) has been attributed to the
product racemization in aqueous media.19a,26 In such circumstances,
a biphasic reduction system may be employed to deliver improved product
enantiopurity.27

Although some differences
were seen in the enantioselectivity of
the reactions catalyzed by NtDBR vs PETN reductase, the product yields
from both reactions were similar with substrates 1a (both
>99%) and 2a (96 vs 85%). More significant differences
in product yields were seen with substrates 8a (12% vs
56%) and (E)-10a (93 vs 70%) for DBR
and PETN reductase, respectively. The reduction of (R)-pulegone (12a) afforded (2S,5R)-menthone and (2R,5R)-isomenthone (Scheme 1c) in moderate yield
and in a ratio of ∼1:2. In contrast, a putative second enzyme
present in N. tabacum has been shown
to catalyze the reduction of (R)-12a with high yields and stereoselectivity, producing almost entirely
(2R,5R)-isomenthone.28 Prior studies suggested an improvement in stereospecificity
could be achieved for the reduction of (R)-12a with recombinant NtDBR by the addition of bovine serum
albumin (BSA). In addition, the presence of Triton X-100, γ-cyclodextrin,
and casein were shown to improve the overall conversion.13 Accordingly, we repeated the NtDBR-catalyzed
reduction of (R)-12a in the presence
of Triton X-100 ± BSA and in the presence of BSA alone. However,
under our conditions, no improvement in conversion or stereospecificity
was observed (results not shown). This may be due to differences in
the sequence or folding of the two protein preparations. The originally
published data13 were obtained from protein
expressed as a GST fusion, with the majority of the tag removed by
proteolysis. In contrast, our data were obtained from C-terminally
His6-tagged protein. It is possible that the presence of
different types of protein tags during protein expression has affected
the conformation of the protein, leading to the observed differences
in rate, stereospecificity, or both.

Table 5 Reduction of Various Activated (R)- and (S)-Perillaldehyde (13a) by NtDBR and PETNRa
a Conditions: NtDBR reactions (1 mL)
were performed aerobically in buffer (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.4) containing alkene (5 mM),
NtDBR (2 μM), NADP+ (10 μM), glucose (15 mM),
and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH; 10 U). PETN reductase reactions (1
mL) were performed anaerobically in buffer (50 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0) containing alkene (5
mM), PETNR (2 μM), NADP+ (10 μM), glucose (15
mM), and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH; 10 U). All reactions were agitated
at 30 °C for 4 or 24 h at 130 rpm. The alkenes were added from
stock solutions in ethanol (2% final solvent concentration in the
reactions).

b Conversion (conv),
yields, and cis/trans
percentage were determined by GC analysis on a DB-WAX column.

Interestingly, NtDBR-catalyzed reduction of (R)- and (S)-perillaldehyde (13a) generated
the same major product from both enantiomers, cis-dihydroperillaldehyde (13b) (Table 5). This is not consistent with the net trans-hydrogenation
mechanism observed for OYE-catalyzed alkene reduction, which is known
to proceed via hydride transfer (from reduced flavin, FMNH2) to the Cβ atom of the substrate and proton transfer (from
a conserved tyrosine residue or water) to the Cα position of
the substrate.3 Indeed, control experiments
with PETN reductase reflected net trans-hydrogenation, regardless
of the substrate’s absolute configuration, yielding trans-dihydroperillaldehyde and cis-dihydroperillaldehyde
from (S)- and (R)-13a, respectively (Table 5). This unusual behavior
has previously been observed for another member of the LTD subfamily,
leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (Ltb4dh), and was
subsequently shown to originate from a divergent stereochemical pathway
with (R)-perillaldehyde undergoing net trans-addition
of H2, whereas the reduction of (S)-perillaldehyde
proceeded with net syn-addition of H2.29 This was reported as the first observation of its kind
by a single enzyme. However, these results suggest it is highly likely
that NtDBR and potentially other members of the LTD family share this
unusual feature.

Conclusions
We have extended our study of “-ene”
reductases to
include NtDBR, a member of the LTD subfamily of the MDR enzymes. Substrate
profiling, via steady-state kinetics and product identification techniques,
has demonstrated its regio- and stereospecificity against a variety
of α,β-unsaturated activated alkenes. In addition to high
activity toward typical LTD substrates, NtDBR also catalyzed the reduction
of several classical OYE-like substrates. Significantly, NtDBR also
demonstrated activity toward non-OYE substrates (i.e., reducing the
exocyclic C=C double bond of (R)-pulegone)
as well as displaying the opposite enantioselectivity during the reduction
of substrates such as (E)-2-phenyl-1-nitroprop-1-ene
(10a) and (S)-perillaldehyde (13a) in comparison with the OYE family member PETN reductase.
This complementary activity emphasizes the potential value of NtDBR
as an industrial biocatalyst, in addition to classical OYE “-ene”
reductases. Unlike OYE’s, NtDBR also benefits from the absence
of a bound flavin cofactor. Flavins can be oxidized by molecular oxygen
at the expense of alkene reduction.30 This
results in an overall reduction in reaction rate and generates the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide and superoxide,19a,30 the presence of which has been shown to sometimes influence product
enantiopurity.31

We have also presented
the X-ray crystal structures of the holo-,
binary (NADP(H)-bound), and ternary [NADP+ and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde
(9a)-bound] NtDBR complexes. The use of high-resolution
structural information for the identification of individual residues/interactions,
important in substrate binding and catalysis, is crucial for the generation
of new biocatalysts with improved characteristics. Previously, we
have achieved notable success in redefining the reactivities, stereochemistries,
and specificities of the OYE family member PETN reductase using a
robotic high-throughput kinetic screening of enzyme mutant libraries.20,32 Although the ternary complex here shows the substrate bound in a
conformation that is likely to be inhibitory, the position of HMHCA
still provides information to aid the determination of which residues
are likely to be involved in forming the alkene substrate binding
pocket.

Structural and specificity data will be used to drive
future structure-driven
high-throughput site-saturated mutagenesis studies to further expand
the biocatalytic potential of this enzyme. Residues to be targeted
include those that line the substrate binding pocket, although key
conserved NAD(P)H-binding residues will be avoided. Residues further
afield, such as ones involved in the overall protein fold and stability,
may be targeted to allow larger substrates to be accommodated in the
active site. In silico substrate binding studies could also drive
site-directed mutagenesis studies, which may allow the likely role(s)
of specific residues to be determined.
