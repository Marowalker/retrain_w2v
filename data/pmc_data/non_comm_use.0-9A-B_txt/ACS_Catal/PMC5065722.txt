Herein
we report a highly efficient and site-selective palladium-catalyzed
oxidative carbocyclization–arylation reaction of bisallenes
and arylboronic acids under operationally simple conditions for the
selective synthesis of cyclohexadiene derivatives. The palladium source
and the solvent proved to be crucial for the selectivity and the reactivity
displayed. Interestingly, in the absence of the nucleophile, an oxidative
carbocyclization-β-elimination pathway predominates. The reaction
conditions are compatible with a wide range of functional groups,
and the reaction exhibits broad substrate scope. Furthermore, key
information regarding the mechanism was obtained using control experiments
and kinetic studies.

==== Body
Carbocyclization reactions of
allenes1 have attracted considerable attention
in the past few years, and the versatile reactivity of allenes has
been exploited in the synthesis of a diverse range of natural products
and biologically active compounds.2 Various
transition-metal-catalyzed cyclization reactions of allenes have been
established for the preparation of a variety of carbo- and heterocyclic
derivatives.3 In particular, novel strategies
based on palladium catalysis have been studied for the construction
of complex molecular structures from simple starting materials.4 Although allenes have been widely utilized in
the carbocyclization reactions, more challenging bisallenes were largely
ignored, and the state-of-the-art of the cyclization reactions of
bisallenes is mostly limited to cycloaddition and cycloisomerization
reactions.5 Therefore, there is an increasing
demand to develop novel and efficient carbocyclizations reaction of
bisallenes.6 In particular, transition-metal-catalyzed
cascade carbocyclization reactions have attracted attention as they
allow the construction of complex molecular structures from simple
starting materials.7,8

Our group has been largely
interested in the development of palladium-catalyzed
oxidative carbocyclization reactions of various unsaturated systems
such as enallenes,9 dienallenes,10 and allenynes.11 In
recent studies, we have described carbocyclization reactions of enallenes
followed by arylation, borylation, or carbonylation.12 In these carbocyclizations, we noticed that the cyclization
was highly sensitive toward the size of the carbocycle being formed.
Enallenes 1a (n = 1) led to the functionalized
cyclopentenes 4 via the intermediacy of 2 and 3 using catalytic amounts of Pd(II)-salt and oxidant
(Scheme 1a). In sharp
contrast, enallenes 1b (n = 2) failed
to provide the corresponding cyclohexene derivatives 7 under these oxidative conditions. Very recently, we reported that
coordination of the pendent olefin with palladium is vital for the
subsequent attack of the allene moiety to palladium for the formation
of intermediate 2.13,14 Weaker coordination
of enallene 1b (n = 2) might be the
reason for its limited reactivity, and we envisaged that replacing
the alkene unit by an allene would resolve the coordination issues
and would give access to the cyclohexene derivatives, which are found
in many natural products (Scheme 1b).15

Scheme 1 Oxidative Pd-Catalyzed
Carbocyclization of (a) Enallenes and (b)
Bisallenes
Controlling the chemoselectivity
of insertion of organopalladium(II)
intermediate with allenes is the key challenge associated with the
envisioned project (Scheme 1b). Insertion of vinylpalladium(II) 9 with allene
can take place either on C2–C3 or C1–C2 of the allene
leading to either cyclopentene 11 or cyclohexene 13 intermediate.16 Quenching these
intermediates with a suitable nucleophile will give the corresponding
carbocycle 12 or 14. Arylboronic acids were
chosen as coupling reagents as they are known to undergo fast transmetalation
with Pd(II). In addition they are nontoxic, easily available, and
stable.17 A further challenge is to control
the site-selectivity for the formation of dienylpalladium(II) intermediate
(cf. 9) when both the allene moieties are substituted
in 8 (R and/or R′ = alkyl) as other cyclization
pathways also compete.

In initial studies, bisallene 8a was allowed to react
with 5 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 in DCE solvent at room temperature
overnight. The reaction was sluggish and afforded a mixture of unidentified
products along with starting material. However, we were pleased to
find that the reaction proceeded smoothly at 60 °C and led to
selective formation of methylencyclohexadiene 15 in 72%
isolated yield after 3 h (Scheme 2). Isolation of 15 as the only product
supports our initial proposal of insertion of dienylpalladium(II)
intermediate 9 selectively at the C1–C2 of the
allene.

Scheme 2 Initial Studies for the Pd-Catalyzed Carbocyclization of Bisallenes
Intrigued by these initial
results, we set out to achieve Pd(II)-catalyzed
oxidative cascade carbocyclization–arylation of bisallenes
(Table 1). For the
initial studies, p-tolylboronic acid was used as
the nucleophile in reaction with 8a. We were pleased
to find that 5 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 and 1.5 equiv of BQ in
DCE solvent at rt overnight afforded the envisioned product in 47%
yield along with 12% of 8a (Entry 1). At slightly higher
temperature (50 °C), the reaction was completed in 4 h and selectively
afforded 18a in 65% NMR yield (Entry 2). No β-elimination
product 15 was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum
of the crude reaction mixture. Various solvents were screened to improve
the yield, and it was found that the reaction has a strong dependence
on the solvent. Although no reaction was observed in polar solvents
such as DMSO and acetonitrile (Entries 8 and 9), other solvents such
as THF, acetone, methanol, and 1,4-dioxane led to the product in 51–71%
yields (Entries 3–6). Gratifyingly, toluene provided cleanly
the product 18b in 81% NMR yield (79% isolated yield)
at 50 °C after 4 h (Entry 7). Screening of the different Pd(II)-salts
was done in toluene solvent (Entries 10–14), among which Pd(OAc)2 was found to be the best catalyst.

After having
the optimized reaction conditions in hand for the
cascade carbocyclization–arylation of bisallenes, we investigated
the scope of the reaction using bisallene 8a. As can
be seen from Scheme 3, various functionalized arylboronic acids reacted efficiently with 8a to give the corresponding products in good to high yields
(18a–18p). Both electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing substituted arylboronic acids resulted in
full conversion in reaction with 8a after 4–5
h. Arylboronic acids with electron-donating substituents such as alkyl
or methoxy groups on the aromatic ring resulted in slightly higher
yields (18a, 18c–18f) compared to those with electron-withdrawing groups (18g–18m). Halogen substituents such as F, Cl, Br,
and I at different positions of the aromatic ring are compatible with
the reaction conditions to afford the corresponding derivatives 18g–18j in good yields (60–78%).

Scheme 3 Scope of the Reaction with Various Boronic Acids
The reaction also tolerates different functional
groups such as
formyl, acetyl, nitro, and vinyl on the aromatic ring of the arylboronic
acids providing the corresponding products 18k–18n in 71%, 79%, 69%, and 77% respectively. Interestingly, trans-2-phenylvinylboronic acid also reacted with bisallene 8a to afford the product 18p in 45% yield.

The optimized reaction conditions established for the reaction
of bisallene 8a were also tested with other bisallenes 8b–8f (Table 2). When the dimethyl groups of the allene
moiety were replaced by more bulky groups such as pentamethylene 8b or diethyl 8c, the corresponding products 18q and 18r were isolated in 74% and 69% yields,
respectively (Entries 2–3). Unsymmetrical allene 8d also showed a similar reactivity to provide a mixture of 18s and 18s′ in a 2.7:1 ratio (Entry 4). Deuterated
cyclohexadiene derivative [d]5-18b was obtained in 68% yield using bisallene [d]6-8a (Entry 5). Despite
the possibility of cross-carbocyclization reaction with substituted
bisallenes 8e and 8f, we were pleased to
find that the reaction gave selectively the carbocyclic products 18t–18v in 57–74% yields under
the optimized conditions (Entries 6–8).

Table 2 Scope of the Various Bisallenes in
the Pd-Catalyzed Carbocyclization
Tetramethyl-substituted
bisallene 8g required a slightly
higher temperature (70 °C) for completion and provided the product 18w in 46% yield along with a cyclopentene byproduct 19 in 18% (Scheme 4). These results indicate the high selectivity of the methodology
to form the dienylpalladium(II)-intermediate (cf. 9)
by the nucleophilic attack of the more substituted allene moiety selectively
on the palladium(II) center. Nucleophilic attack of the second allene
moiety of 18w onto Pd(II) affords Int, which
after carbopalladation onto C2–C3 of allene and arylation leads
to 19.

Scheme 4 Pd-Catalyzed Carbocyclization–Arylation Cascade
with Bisallene 8g
To gain some insight into the reaction mechanism, several
control
experiments were performed. In the absence of benzoquinone, only traces
of the product were observed using 1.0 equiv of Pd(OAc)2 in reaction with 8a, suggesting that BQ is playing
a more pivotal role than acting only as a simple oxidant for this
transformation. Enallene 20 was treated with phenylboronic
acid (Scheme 5a) under
the standard conditions. No formation of the corresponding cyclized
product 21 was observed, suggesting that the allene moiety
was crucial for the successful Pd(II)-catalyzed carbocyclization.
In another control experiment, differently substituted enallene 22 was treated with phenyboronic acid under the optimized
conditions (Scheme 5b). Even at a higher temperature with prolonged reaction time, no
product was observed. Comparison of this outcome with the isolation
of 19 as a byproduct in reaction with 8g (Scheme 4), clearly
suggests the importance of the formation of π-complex between
Pd(II) and the allene unit of bisallene for the nucleophilic addition
of the allene moiety to the palladium center to form the required
dienylpalladium(II)-complex.

Scheme 5 Attempted Pd-Catalyzed Carbocyclization
Reactions with Enallenes
To gain more insight into the reaction mechanism, deuterium
kinetic
isotopic effect studies were performed. To investigate whether there
is any competitive kinetic isotopic effect, a 1:1 mixture of 8a and [d]6-8a was allowed to react with phenylboronic acid under optimized reaction
conditions. A ratio of 4.4:1.0 between 18b and [d]5-18b was observed
(21% conversion, 15 min), from which the KIE (kH/kD) was determined to be 5.17
(Scheme 6a). The large
KIE value in the competitive experiment requires that the C–H
bond cleavage has to occur prior to any irreversible step of the reaction.
Furthermore, parallel kinetic experiments were also performed where
phenylboronic acid was allowed to react with 8a and [d]6-8a in separate experiments.
The progress of both the reactions was monitored by 1H
NMR at different time intervals (Scheme 6b). From these parallel kinetic experiments,
an intermolecular KIE (kH/kD from initial rate) of 4.7 was obtained. The large KIE value of 4.7
indicates that the allylic C–H bond cleavage is involved in
the rate-determining step.

Scheme 6 (a) Competitive Kinetic Isotopic Effect;
(b) Parallel Kinetic Experiments;
(c) Kinetic Isotopic Effect for β-Elimination
In addition, competitive deuterated kinetic
studies were also performed
for the Pd(II)-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization-β-elimination
process leading to 15 (Scheme 6c). A mixture of 8a and [d]6-8a was subjected
to the conditions that favored the formation of 15, which
afforded a competitive kinetic isotope effect of kH/kD = 6.1.

On the basis of the control
experiments in Scheme 5 and the deuterium kinetic isotopic experiments,
the mechanism in Scheme 7 is proposed. Pd(OAc)2 forms a π-complex (24), in which both allene units are coordinated to Pd(II).
Nucleophilic attack of the more substituted allene moiety on the palladium
center followed by rate-determining allylic C–H bond cleavage
leads to the selective formation of dienylpalladium(II) species 25 co-ordinatinated with BQ. The intermediate 25 undergoes intramolecular carbopalladation of the C1–C2 double
bond of the second allene generating the (σ-allyl)palladium(II)-intermediate 26. Subsequent transmetalation with arylboronic acid 17 leads to the formation of 27. Reductive elimination
from 27 affords the product 18. Competing
rearrangement of (σ-allyl)palladium(II) intermediate 26 to the other (σ-allyl)palladium(II)-intermediate 28 proceeds through the (π-allyl)palladium(II) complex 16, which gives 15 after β-elimination.

Scheme 7 Proposed Mechanism
In conclusion, we have developed a novel palladium(II)-catalyzed
oxidatative carbocyclization–arylation cascade reaction of
bisallenes and arylboronic acids, providing access to a wide range
of functionalized cyclohexadiene derivatives. Despite the possibility
of various side reactions, the reaction conditions allowed the selective
formation of the carbocyclic products under operationally simple reaction
conditions. We propose that the facile formation of six-membered rings
is due to the fact that the carbocyclization of the allene is geometrically
favored due to perpendicular π-systems of the allene. The selectivity
for six-membered rings and the compatibility of the various functional
groups are highlights of the current reaction. Further studies to
increase the scope of this carbocyclization beyond arylation and the
synthetic application of this protocol are underway in our group.
