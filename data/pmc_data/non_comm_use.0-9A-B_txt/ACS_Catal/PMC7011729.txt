The
development of catalytic enantioselective methods is routinely
carried out using easily accessible and prototypical substrates. This
approach to reaction development often yields asymmetric methods that
perform poorly using substrates that are sterically or electronically
dissimilar to those used during the reaction optimization campaign.
Consequently, expanding the scope of previously optimized catalytic
asymmetric reactions to include more challenging substrates is decidedly
nontrivial. Here, we address this challenge through the development
of a systematic workflow to broaden the applicability and reliability
of asymmetric conjugate additions to substrates conventionally regarded
as sterically and electronically demanding. The copper-catalyzed asymmetric
conjugate addition of alkylzirconium nucleophiles to form tertiary
centers, although successful for linear alkyl chains, fails for more
sterically demanding linear α,β-unsaturated ketones. Key
to adapting this method to obtain high enantioselectivity was the
synthesis of modified phosphoramidite ligands, designed using quantitative
structure–selectivity relationships (QSSRs). Iterative rounds
of model construction and ligand synthesis were executed in parallel
to evaluate the performance of 20 chiral ligands. The copper-catalyzed
asymmetric addition is now more broadly applicable, even tolerating
linear enones bearing tert-butyl β-substituents.
The presence of common functional groups is tolerated in both nucleophiles
and electrophiles, giving up to 99% yield and 95% ee across 20 examples.

Introduction
The development of
catalytic asymmetric methods usually begins
with the examination of a simple, readily available and prototypical
substrate. While this approach is undeniably useful, it also often
leads to a reaction protocol that is not widely applicable beyond
the simple starting scaffold. Extending the scope of new reactions
to include a variety of more complex substrates offers a wider range
of potential applications. Reoptimization of reactions is often driven
by empirical trial-and-error screening, a process that relies heavily
on chance and intuition, making this a formidable challenge. There
is a pressing need for a rational and operationally simple process
to extend catalytic asymmetric methods to encompass electronically
and/or sterically different starting materials to those used during
optimization.

The copper-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition
(ACA) of organometallic
species is a powerful tool to synthesize new C–C bonds from
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.1−8 After tremendous attention for more than 20 years, the ACA is now
arguably one of the most useful asymmetric transformations available
to synthetic chemists, and has been used in the synthesis of a variety
of natural products.8−15 However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be
met to reach its full potential. A lack of robustness in Cu-catalyzed
ACAs is well-known, and widely implicated in preventing the approach
from enriching mainstream synthetic strategies and methods,16,17 though it should be mentioned that examples of ACAs to give >50
g of product have recently been reported.18,19 Another reason for the underutilization of this method stems from
method development being carried out with commonly available substrates,20 so that seemingly obvious extensions to slightly
unusual or more highly decorated reaction partners do not display
the desired reactivity patterns.21,22

There
is a significant gap in the scope of products theoretically
accessible through ACA methods and those that can be produced in practice,
and an incomplete understanding of how to address this unmet need
limits further applications in complex molecule settings. To truly
make Cu-catalyzed ACA a “go-to methodology”,16 several advances are necessary, including an
operationally simple reaction setup under convenient conditions, and
tolerance to a wider array of substrates.

During our work on
Cu-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions23−26 of alkylzirconium species (generated
from olefins) we found that
asymmetric additions to linear enones bearing linear alkyl chains
work well (>90% ee),27 but additions
to
electronic or sterically deactivated enones gave only very poor results
(<50% ee). This limitation is not unusual in ACA chemistry.22,28 Simple linear substrates are also more challenging than their cyclic
counterparts, as the population of both s-cis and s-trans conformers of the enone substrate can lower the
enantioselectivity.22,29 The use of such substrates is
a long-standing challenge in asymmetric catalysis that motivated us
to explore rational approaches to expand the scope of previously optimized
catalytic asymmetric reactions.

Here, we report that new phosphoramidite
ligands,8,30,31 developed
with the aid of quantitative
structure–selectivity relationships (QSSRs), allow highly enantioselective
Cu-catalyzed ACAs of alkylzirconium species to linear enones bearing
branched substituents or conjugated aromatic rings (Scheme 1). Selection of the best ligand
from this series achieved high selectivity and reactivity with linear
α,β-unsaturated ketones bearing β-substituents as
bulky as tert-butyl groups.

These Limitations
Results and Discussion
Initial Results
Benzylideneacetone 1a was
previously found to be a challenging substrate for the Cu-catalyzed
ACA27 and was therefore chosen as a good
candidate for examination. Previous conditions for related asymmetric
additions were reoptimized, and we subsequently found that the use
of copper(I) triflate and a phosphoramidite ligand in the presence
of TMSCl were critical to achieve high reactivity. A combination of
CH2Cl2 and Et2O in a 1:4 mixture
at 0 °C also proved to be optimal for selectivity, consistent
with previously reported studies.24

Structure–Selectivity
Relationships
We then
examined structurally diverse phosphoramidite ligands (see Scheme S1 in the SI for more details) to explore
the Phosphoramidite Ligand Space with the objective of finding a ligand
“lead” structure to develop further. This preliminary
screen uncovered the initially promising ligand L1, giving
90% yield and 71% ee. Structural diversification of the L1 scaffold provided the qualitative ligand structure-enantioselectivity
relationship shown in Scheme 2A.

Scheme 2 (A) Analysis of the Structure–Selectivity Relationship
from
the Initial Ligand Derivatization and (B) Ligand Design Workflow Used
in This Work
Several trends in
ligand performance are apparent from these data:
The aminoindane ring size is relatively unimportant (cf. L1, L2) while the BINOL configuration dictates which
is the major product enantiomer. The stereogenic center on the indane
provides a matched–mismatched effect (cf. L3, L4) and enantioselectivity
can be tuned by variation of the R group, giving results from 67%
to 92% ee (cf. L2, L4–L6). However, the variation in enantioselectivity as a function
of relatively minor changes to the alkyl group was unexpected. Assuming
Curtin–Hammett behavior,32 the Gibbs
energy difference between competing diastereomeric transition states
(ΔΔG⧧) for ligand L4 with an isopropyl moiety is 3.8 kJ/mol at 0 °C, whereas
a simple replacement of isopropyl to isononyl (L6) more
than doubles this value to 7.7 kJ/mol. Nonintuitive effects of ligand
structure on enantioselectivity are common in asymmetric transition
metal catalysis,23 usually due to the complexity
of interactions involved and the involvement of several competitive
transition structures. As shown by the data collected thus far, qualitative
conclusions can be drawn from a structure–selectivity relationship
but offer limited design guidance beyond intuitively increasing the
length of the alkyl chain, without any notion of shape or properties.
Ideally, one would prefer to make decisions based on a predicted ee
value possessing a tight confidence interval to start the next ligand
synthesis.

Multivariate Modeling
Inspired by
Sigman’s development
of predictive and mechanistic multivariate linear regression models
for reaction development,33 we recently
reported the optimization of Cu-catalyzed ACA to β-substituted
cyclopentenones23 and cyclohexenone34 with the aid of QSSR. This approach allows one
to correlate experimentally observed enantioselectivities against
molecular descriptors, quantitative parameters that capture structural
and/or electronic differences between the ligands used. These descriptors
may be derived from experimental or computed properties even in the
absence of detailed mechanistic knowledge, and indeed, the resulting
models may then be useful in formulating a mechanistic hypothesis.
Computational mechanistic studies (e.g., using density functional
theory) have previously aided the optimization of phosphoramidite
ligands used in metal-catalyzed asymmetric transformations.35,36 However, these approaches are significantly more expensive and require
prior detailed knowledge of mechanism and competing stereodetermining
transition structures. Impressive predictive accuracies of ∼2
kJ/mol have been obtained using QSSR models, which should be viewed
in a favorable light when compared with the bounds of chemical accuracy
attainable by quantum chemical calculations of around ∼4 kJ/mol.37 Furthermore, statistical modeling can accelerate
the design of new ligands by prioritizing the most useful syntheses,
which remains the principal bottleneck of the design process.38 Other promising methods also exist.39

Incomplete mechanistic understanding and
the absence of quantitative guidelines led us toward the use of QSSR,
where our strategy was to conduct rounds of statistical model construction
and ligand synthesis in parallel. Iterative refinement of the model
could then be accomplished as new data were collected. We aimed to
achieve high enantioinduction of 1a and assumed higher
reactivity could also be obtained in the process. The assertion that
selectivity generally decreases with increasing reactivity is a long-standing
myth in organic chemistry,40 and indeed,
we have previously found new ligands to increase both yield and enantioselectivity.

Our ligand design workflow started with the collection and curation
of all available data, regardless of the achieved selectivity (Scheme 2B). This was followed
by the generation of steric and electronic descriptors for each ligand,
optimized after a conformational search. Internal and external validation
of the model was a critical step to obtain a statistically valid model.
One could finally predict the enantioselectivity of ligands in silico and discard unpromising structures. We only synthesized
ligands that would provide useful information to the model or that
would likely achieve high enantioselectivity. These synthesized ligands
could then be fed to the model such that the QSSR model would gradually
become stronger in an iterative way.

Guided by the qualitative
structure–selectivity relationship
(Scheme 2A), we restricted
ligand modification to structural diversification of the aliphatic
R-group only. We reasoned that this reduced search space for ligand
optimization could be explored more efficiently, while still providing
sufficient variation in selectivity values (as discussed above) from
which to extract meaningful structure–selectivity trends. The
BINOL backbone and indanyl group were not modified further and were
retained in a matched configuration. Following these
criteria, nine data points were initially used for model building
out of  sixteen ligands explored in the initial screening
(see Scheme S2 in the SI).

Molecular
feature descriptors were generated to quantify the steric
and electronic properties of the phosphoramidite ligands (see Table S2 in the SI). A statistically significant
and validated correlation (p < 0.05, RTrain2 and RTest2 and RCV2 > 0.6)41 was
obtained
between enantioselectivity (expressed in terms of ΔΔG⧧) and the lipophilicity parameter log
P, the logarithm of n-octanol/water partition coefficient
generated with the ALOGPS42 algorithm (Figure 1). Model I has an R2 of 89% and a root mean squared error (RMSE)
of 0.66 kJ/mol. There are six ligands in the training set for only
one parameter, and the ANOVA test confirmed the statistical significance
of the parameter (p < 0.05). An external validation
test set formed from a hold-out subset of ligands has a good fit (R2 = 87%) and an RMSE of 1.93 kJ/mol. Internal
validation with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) also showed
the model to be fairly robust, particularly in light of the limited
amount of data (R2 = 78% and RMSE = 0.96
kJ/mol). All measured values were determined by HPLC on a chiral nonracemic
stationary phase and are an average of at least two reaction repeats.
Experimental error was found to be within ±3% for yields and
within ±1% for ee values. The maximum accuracy achievable with
the model is therefore of 1% ee due to the experimental error.

Figure 1 Continuous
refinement of the model with new input of data. The
model correlates experimentally measured enantioselectivity and predicted
enantioselectivity. The gray area represents the standard error at
95% confidence interval and ee’s were averaged from
at least two reaction repeats.

We set boundaries for the exploration of Phosphoramidite
Ligand
Space based on synthetic accessibility. Ligand synthesis currently
represents the bottleneck in our approach, and so we considered only
those structures accessible from readily available commercial sources
or fragments that could easily be synthesized within four well-established
synthetic steps. Ligand synthesis and enantioselectivity prediction
were carried out in parallel. Although there is no singular definition
for the applicability domain (AD) of a statistical model, and the
utility of this concept is contested,43 we only envisaged potential in silico ligands possessing
aliphatic R groups. Therefore, no heteroelements were added to the
alkyl substituent even if the lipophilicity value could have been
improved. As a rule of thumb, the quality of extrapolative predictions
deteriorates further away from the area of feature space spanned by
the training data. Inside this space interpolative predictions can
be made confidently, and so we focused on aliphatic substituents only.44

An in silico library
of twenty-two synthetically
accessible ligands (see Scheme S3 in the
SI) was developed to satisfy the above considerations. Molecular descriptors
were computed for each of these ligands and submitted into the model,
represented as gray dots in Figure 1. The predicted levels of enantioselectivity were used
to plan the next phase of ligand synthesis. We selected evenly spaced
values along the range of predicted selectivities (gray labels), focusing
our efforts in the region above 6.0 kJ/mol (>85% ee). Inspired
by
Bayesian Optimization approaches,45 for
which data acquisition is a trade-off between exploring regions of
high uncertainty versus exploring regions of lower uncertainty, but
higher expected values, we set out to improve the predictive power
of our model while also targeting higher enantioselectivities.

The enantioselectivity of L12 was predicted between
79% and 93% ee (95% confidence interval) according to the initial
model. Experimentally this was determined as 94% ee. This new data
point could now be used to refine (i.e., retrain) the statistical
model. By expanding the feature space spanned by the training data,
predictions for new ligands can be made more confidently. Accordingly,
incorporating the newly generated data into model training led to
almost identical statistical performance across the training set,
but with narrower error intervals. The in silico ligand
library was then predicted again, guiding us next to synthesize L13, predicted to give between 90% and 98% ee and afforded
92% ee. Slightly narrower confidence intervals were again achieved
by feeding the model with more information, and similar model quality
was achieved. Synthesis and testing of L14 resulted in
92% ee, within 0.7 kJ/mol of the predicted range of 94–99%
ee. This approach is illustrative of how a targeted data-collection
strategy can be used to iteratively refine an underlying statistical
model and generate more confident predictions. For a (multivariate)
linear regression, optimization of the output necessarily involves extrapolation to a previously unexplored region of feature
space, so the above approach proves particularly useful. Unlike linear
models, the optimal values of nonlinear parametric models (e.g., higher
order polynomials,46 support-vector machines,44 random forests47)
can lie within the bounds of existing feature space, such that extrapolative
prediction may not be necessary to accomplish reaction optimization.
Nevertheless, predictive performance can still be enhanced by additional
data collection in sparsely covered regions of chemical space.

We hypothesized that the correlation of enantioselectivity and
lipophilicity might be due to catalyst solubility, whereby lipophilic
R groups could help to either solubilize the active catalyst or disperse
inactive aggregates. The concentration of active catalyst was varied
by an order of magnitude to test this hypothesis. As shown in Figure 1, both reactivity
and selectivity were unaffected by concentration, forcing us to abandon
this assumption.

We decided to challenge model I by preparing
phosphoramidite ligands
with unsymmetric and more branched alkyl groups, with the indane and
BINOL moieties unchanged. Even though the predictions were acceptable
and allowed for a slight improvement of enantioselectivity, we decided
to build more predictive models with tighter confidence intervals
through a more widely distributed and uniform sample of data points.

L15, containing a β-cyclocitral derivative in
the R group, behaved surprisingly well as it afforded 75% ee with
ee values predicted between 75% and 88%. L16–L18 however behaved unexpectedly, and the correlation started
to break. L17 gave a striking difference between predicted
and measured enantioselectivity and shows how small structural changes
can result in large “cliffs” in terms of enantioselectivity.
Such cliff-edge effects are unpredictable by nature and have similarities
to the so-called “magic methyl effect” encountered in
drug discovery.48 As shown in Figure 2A, we observed a
jump in selectivity and reactivity in moving from L4 (93%,
67% ee) to L17 (99%, 92% ee). Our model only focuses
on enantioselectivity, but our objective as always is to achieve good
selectivity and reactivity with ACA. Thus, ligand L17 afforded a similar level of selectivity as previously
achieved with L6, but far better reactivity (99% versus
63% isolated yield). Reaction kinetics were also about an order of
magnitude faster, with the reaction now typically complete in 30 min.

Figure 2 (A) Substitution
of isopropyl with methyl groups leads to an important
selectivity jump, likely due to a conformational change. Global minimum
conformers are optimized at the ωB97X-D/6-31G(d) level
of theory. (B) Synthesized ligands ranked following their distance
from the origin in a yield versus selectivity plot.
Distances further from the origin indicate superior performance.

This substituent effect was not
captured by changes in the lipophilicity
descriptors. As shown in Figure 2A, the conformation of L17 differs from
that of L2 such that it affects the ΔΔG⧧ by +2.92 kJ/mol. A gauche conformation
is preferred by the acyclic 3-pentyl group that might cause a long-distance
change in the active catalyst that leads to better enantioselectivity.
Superimposition of L4 and L2 proved identical
whereas L17 and L18 both had similar gauche
conformations that avoid destabilizing syn-pentane
interactions and which was consistent with the grouping of the observed
enantioselectivities for these four ligands.

We examined whether
the inclusion of additional descriptors would
allow us to capture the effect of methylation (exemplified by ligand L4, L2, L17 in Figure 2A). Conformations likely play
an important role in enantioselectivity here as highlighted by the
improvement obtained by comparing L2 (73% ee) to L6 (92% ee) (Scheme 2A), but steric parameters failed to show promise (e.g., Sterimol).
Molecular descriptors might then fail to grasp the important features
responsible for enantioinduction since flexible chains are often treated
statically in a single conformation. For example, Sterimol steric
parameters refer to a particular geometry and do not automatically
take into account effects of a conformational ensemble.33 In contrast to this, weighted Sterimol (wSterimol)49 parameters report on the Boltzmann average along
with minimum and maximum values across the ensemble. Upon examination,
wSterimol parameters confirmed the anticipated impact of conformation
on the output values and its error (on average ±6 kJ/mol, see Figure S2 in the SI), although no meaningful
correlation was obtained using these descriptors.

Inspired by
Doyle’s use of electronic structure calculations
to generate atomic and molecular descriptors,47 we used the Spartan package50 to generate parameters from which the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and dipole moment of the global minimum
energy conformer of each ligands were found to correlate with reaction
outcome (Figure 1). L19 was then predicted at 78% ee and actually afforded 75%
ee, so we decided to continue with this new model. The descriptors
of synthetically accessible ligands (represented as gray dots) were
computed again and were fed to the newly generated model. L20 followed by L21 and L22 were thus predicted
and then synthesized.

The final model, model II, possesses a
good fit (14 ligands, R2 = 84%, RMSE =
0.91 kJ/mol). The external test
set also showed satisfactory correlation (six ligands, R2 = 86%, RMSE = 0.93 kJ/mol), and LOOCV remains acceptable
(R2 = 75%, RMSE = 1.16 kJ/mol). There
are 14 ligands in the training set for only two descriptors in the
model equation, and the ANOVA test confirmed the statistical significance
of the descriptors (p < 0.05).

The ligand
HOMO energy relates to the nonbonding phosphorus lone
pair. Although the classification of molecular descriptors as either
electronic or steric is not absolute,51 a higher HOMO energy is indicative of a more electron-rich σ-donating
ligand with a stronger metal–ligand bond. A positive coefficient
in the regression model indicates that higher HOMO energies lead to
higher levels of selectivity. On the other hand, the dipole moment
describes the overall charge distribution in the ligand and also captures
the gross molecular shape (e.g., 2.26 D with L4 and 2.09
D with L17, which is an 8% relative difference arising
due to changing the length of the alkyl chain). This parameter therefore
indirectly reflects steric as well as electronic differences and is
sensitive to the length and branching of the N-alkyl
substituent. The model coefficient is negative meaning that smaller
dipole moments lead to higher levels of selectivity.

In total,
an in silico library of 24 synthetically
accessible ligands was predicted using the final model. As none of
the newly predicted selectivities were in excess of previously realized
experimental values, ligand optimization was halted at this stage.
We had reached a maximum in selectivity based on the structural diversification
of aliphatic R groups.

Retrospectively, the value in developing
a multivariate model arises
from not having to synthesize all of the ligands that were considered
as potential candidates. Even for cases where structures could be
developed using chemical intuition alone, the overall reduction in
non-value-added ligand syntheses is a critical component in the acceleration
of the ligand design process. This approach allowed us to systematically
discard unpromising ideas and to rationally prioritize the synthesis
of the most useful ligands, from both practical and statistical points
of view. Additionally, we were also able to gain mechanistic insights
into L17, as shown in Figure 2A. Moreover, the final model suggested a
halt to the ligand optimization campaign, based on in silico predictions that no further improvements would be forthcoming.

Multiobjective Ranking
The ultimate objective of asymmetric
catalyst development is to achieve high reactivity and enantioselectivity. Accordingly, catalyst selection should address
both criteria. Therefore, we ranked our synthesized ligands according
to their yield and enantioselectivity to identify the best all-round
performance. Plotting yield versus enantioselectivity, the equation
in Figure 2B represents
the normalized distance to the origin (0% yield, 0% ee). The simultaneous
ranking of more than one objective function (e.g., yield and selectivity)
produces sets of equally good, nondominated solutions
rather than a singular value.52 The Pareto
optimal set39 contains those ligands for
which there are no other examples superior in both yield and selectivity. The analysis showed that L17 was the best ligand in our library, placed equal first with L14. The synthesis of L14 is more tedious due
to the need to synthesize the corresponding ketone in three steps
with mediocre yields. It was therefore decided to continue with L17 (derived from a commercially available ketone) as the
best ligand in our library that gives the largest yield of the product
major enantiomer. This ligand quickly proved to have an impact outside
this work, giving higher levels of reactivity in other reactions such
as the desymmetrization of meso-bisphosphates.53

Scope
The scope of the reaction
was finally investigated
with our new ligand L17. As well as varying the nucleophiles
used we also probed the effects of putting substituents in various
positions that were not tolerated in our previous system (Scheme 3). A phenyl ring
at the R2 position (2) gave the desired product
with 72% yield and 92% ee. An isopropyl bearing electrophile (3) led to similar levels of selectivity. To our delight, even
a tert-butyl group in 4, which is well-known
to be unsuitably reactive, gave satisfactory yield (71%) and 82% ee.
The examination of two other branched and hindered electrophiles at
the 4-position provided product with high ee (5 and 6).

Scheme 3 Optimized Conditions and Substrate Scope of the ACA
on α,β-Unsaturated
Ketone Bearing Branched or Aromatic Moieties
ACA was also effective when R2 phenyl rings
were substituted
with a nitro group (7, 91% ee), although an electron
donating methoxy group gave poor results (8, 72% ee).
Halogen substitution at a different position (9–11) afforded between 81% and 95% ee. Heteroaromatic rings
(12 and 13) were also tolerated, however
giving moderate selectivity.

Substitution on R1 is
well-accepted by the catalyst,
providing high ee and excellent reactivity in the case of branched
aliphatic or aromatic substituents (14–16). Even chalcone, to give 17, was tolerated although
this was obtained with a lower selectivity (96% yield, 78% ee).

Different nucleophiles were examined. 18 was obtained
with 99% yield and 92% ee (59% yield and 33% ee achieved in previous
work).27 Functionalized alkenes such as
bromostyrene afforded 90% yield of 19 with 93% ee. 6-Chlorohexene
gave 20 in high yield (88%) and high ee (91%). Use of
protected alcohol (21) provided similar results (62%,
93% ee), with somewhat lower yield due to competitive slow in situ TBS deprotection.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, an iterative protocol has guided the development
of a new ligand for transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric reactions
(L17). The addition onto linear α,β-unsaturated
ketones possessing bulky or aromatic groups, chosen as a challenging
case study, now proceeds satisfactorily even with bulky tert-butyl β-substituents. Key to selectivity was the fine-tuning
of phosphoramidite ligands, designed with the aid of quantitative
structure–selectivity relationships. The QSSR approach allowed
us to quickly discard unpromising potential ligand structures, which
easily justifies the time spent generating models as ligand synthesis
remains the bottleneck of the design process. A key lesson from this
work is that one should aim for tighter confidence intervals and not
just statistically significant models as this allows for a more useful
ranking of the in silico ligands. Selectivity optimization
using multivariate linear regression is fundamentally and inescapably
an exercise in extrapolative prediction: the targeted collection of
new data in unexplored areas of chemical space should be prioritized.
At the end, we improved our understanding to reach higher levels of
enantioinduction, and the method now achieves up to 99% yield and
95% ee on a broader range of substrates. We hope that this work will
be used as an example on how to “fix” an asymmetric
reaction, but we also showcase how copper-catalyzed ACA is becoming
a more robust reaction potentially capable of enriching mainstream
synthetic methodologies.
