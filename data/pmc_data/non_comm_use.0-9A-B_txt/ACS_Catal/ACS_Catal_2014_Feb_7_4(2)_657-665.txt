Liquid
organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) are compounds that enable
chemical energy storage through reversible hydrogenation. They are
considered a promising technology to decouple energy production and
consumption by combining high-energy densities with easy handling.
A prominent LOHC is N-ethylcarbazole (NEC), which
is reversibly hydrogenated to dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole
(H12-NEC). We studied the reaction of H12-NEC
on Pt(111) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions by applying infrared
reflection–absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation-based
high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed
molecular beam methods. We show that molecular adsorption of H12-NEC on Pt(111) occurs at temperatures between 173 and 223
K, followed by initial C–H bond activation in direct proximity
to the N atom. As the first stable dehydrogenation product, we identify
octahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (H8-NEC). Dehydrogenation
to H8-NEC occurs slowly between 223 and 273 K and much
faster above 273 K. Stepwise dehydrogenation to NEC proceeds while
heating to 380 K. An undesired side reaction, C–N bond scission,
was observed above 390 K. H8-NEC and H8-carbazole
are the dominant products desorbing from the surface. Desorption occurs
at higher temperatures than H8-NEC formation. We show that
desorption and dehydrogenation activity are directly linked to the
number of adsorption sites being blocked by reaction intermediates.

Introduction
The transition to renewable
sources of energy is linked to the
problem that the availability of sun and wind energy is highly intermittent
and depends on meteorological factors that are hard to control. Thus,
for a high share of renewable energy in electricity production, sun
and wind energy “overproduction” at “energy-rich”
times (sun is shining, wind is blowing) must be efficiently stored
for utilization at “energy-lean” times (night, no wind
is blowing). Among the compounds for chemical energy storage, hydrogen
is by far the most efficient from a gravimetric point of view;1 however, the drawbacks of physical storage methods,
that is, liquid or compressed,1−5 are apparent. To avoid cryogenic temperatures or high pressures,
new hydrogen storage technologies are required that are cost-efficient,
safe, and easily applicable at larger scale. These requirements are
met by the concept of so-called “liquid organic hydrogen carriers”
(LOHCs).6−10 The idea is based on the catalytic conversion of energy-lean to
energy-rich organic compounds through reversible hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation. Once loaded with hydrogen (produced, e.g., via water
electrolysis at energy-rich times), these carriers can be easily transported
and stored without any loss, making use of the existing transport
and storage logistics of liquid fuels. At the desired place and energy-lean
times, hydrogen is released, for example, for combustion or to operate
a fuel cell. The dehydrogenated, energy-lean compound is again rehydrogenated
at energy-rich times without being consumed (note that hydrogenation
and dehydrogenation are separate processes, typically performed under
different conditions and on different catalysts). Recently, the potential
of LOHC technology has been analyzed in detail, for both mobile7 and stationary8 applications.

Finding the ideal LOHC system is not trivial. A suitable LOHC pair
should combine the appropriate physical and chemical properties (e.g.,
suitable melting points, favorable hydrogenation thermodynamics, high
thermal stability), it should have low toxicity, and it must be easily
available at a large scale and at a low price, with a low level of
impurities that may be harmful for the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation
catalyst.7 Among the potential carrier
molecules, heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are promising candidates.11−13 Particularly, N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) has been identified
as a high-potential contender for an energy-lean LOHC compound (see
Figure 1a).14 Through
reversible hydrogenation to dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole
(H12-NEC), NEC is capable to store 5.8 wt % H2.7 Although this value is attractive,
challenges remain in the field of catalyst development, for example,
the minimization (or even elimination) of the noble metal content,
maximization of reaction rates at low temperatures, and the optimization
of selectivity to avoid undesired side reactions.

hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of NEC
and H12-NEC, respectively. (b) IR spectra recorded during
H12-NEC exposure of Pt(111) under isothermal conditions
at selected temperatures. The spectra were recorded after 30 min of
exposure.

Understanding the dehydrogenation
mechanisms is therefore critical
toward the development of better catalysts; however, not much is known
about the detailed reaction mechanisms of LOHCs such as H12-NEC at the microscopic scale. Molecular insights into the catalytic
reaction mechanisms and the associated microkinetics can be obtained
from model studies using a surface science approach.15−17

Previously, we showed that H12-NEC adsorbs molecularly
on Pd(111)18 and supported Pd nanoparticles19 at cryogenic temperatures. Initial C–H
bond activation at the α-carbons takes place at about 170 K
on the nanoparticles and 200 K on the planar surface. Such an activation
is in line with the theoretical work by Sotoodeh and Smith,20 stating that H8-NEC is the first
stable reaction intermediate. H8-NEC starts to desorb from
the Pd(111) surface at 330 K, and the maximum reaction rate is reached
at 550 K. An important finding is the abstraction of the ethyl side
chain at elevated temperature and subsequent decomposition to small
molecular fragments, finally yielding atomic carbon and nitrogen.
This reaction pathway is similar to other hydrocarbons on transition
metal surfaces at elevated temperature.21,22 Note that
C–N bond scission is found both on real catalysts and in surface
science studies, but the rate is much higher in the latter case, that
is, on clean surfaces and at low pressure.

Here, we present
the results of such a surface science study on
Pt(111), combining temperature-programmed, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (HRXPS), temperature-programmed molecular beam (TPMB)
experiments, and infrared absorption–reflection spectroscopy
(IRAS), analyzing both surface species and gas phase products. This
study follows a short communication in which the adsorption of H12-NEC on Pt(111) at 140 K and the subsequent thermal evolution
were studied solely by HRXPS.23 In contrast
to the latter work, we explore the reaction during continuous supply
of the reactant. This temperature-programmed reaction study using
HRXPS and TPMB provides data on both the surface species and the desorbing
products, thus enabling insight into the influence of adsorbates on
the dehydrogenation mechanism. In addition, the presented data on
Pt(111) allow for a comparison with our recent study on Pd(111).18 We also introduce an improved TPMB measurement
procedure to identify reaction products in the gas phase.

Results and discussion
Interaction
of H12-NEC with Pt(111) Studied by IRAS
In the
first step, the interaction of H12-NEC with the
clean Pt(111) surface was studied by IRAS under isothermal conditions.
H12-NEC was deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD)
at several temperatures ranging from 100 to 473 K. The deposition
process was continuously followed by IR spectroscopy in time-resolved
(TR) mode. Representative spectra for each temperature are displayed
in Figure 1b. The complete series of time-resolved
spectra are provided in Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information.

The most prominent features in the low temperature
region (100 to 173 K) are CH2 deformation bands around
1450 cm–1, the CH stretching vibration at 2791 cm–1, the CH2 symmetric stretching modes at
2851 cm–1, the CH2 asymmetric stretching
modes at 2930 cm–1, and the CH3 asymmetric
stretch modes at 2963 cm–1. The assignment of the
bands is based on DFT calculations and was discussed in more detail
in our previous publications.18,19

Comparison of
these spectra with those of the multilayer of H12-NEC physisorbed
on Pd(111)18 at
100, 123, and 173 K does not reveal any difference, indicating that
at temperatures up to 173 K, multilayers of H12-NEC adsorb
molecularly on Pt(111) without decomposition. We underline that this
holds true even at 173 K, in contrast with our previous H12-NEC adsorption experiments on a Pd/Al2O3/NiAl(110)
model system, in which first evidence of dehydrogenation (new band
at 1547 cm–1) was observed already at this temperature.19 On Pt(111), no multilayer is formed at 223 K
and above, which is deduced from the significant decrease in intensity
of all bands at large exposures. On the basis of the fact that neither
new bands are observed nor any significant change in relative intensity
is found up to 173 K, we exclude conversion of the fully hydrogenated
LOHC compound on Pt(111) up to this temperature. By comparing the
time-resolved adsorption spectra (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) at 223 K with those at
lower temperatures, differences are revealed. Multilayer formation
up to 173 K is reflected by a constant increase in all bands over
the entire exposure time, whereas at 223 K, saturation after a 2 min
exposure indicates formation of a monolayer. At 273 K, a shallow band
becomes visible at 1542 cm–1 (Supporting Information Figure S1). A similar band was also
observed in the H12-NEC/Pd(111) system. On the basis of
DFT calculations, it was attributed to the C=C vibrational
modes of a partially dehydrogenated intermediate with a fully aromatic
five-membered ring, that is, with the hydrogen atoms being abstracted
from the positions 4a, 4b, 8a, and 9a. This intermediate is hereafter
referred to as H8-NEC. Considering the CH2 and
CH vibrational modes, no significant differences are observed between
223 and 273 K.

We should point out here for further discussion
that the band at
2791 cm–1 is exclusively localized at the α-carbon
atoms in the carbazole skeleton (positions 8a and 9a). According to
our previous findings, the initial step of dehydrogenation is manifested
in cleavage of the C–H bonds at these positions. This process
is generally reflected by a decrease or disappearance of the CH vibration
at 2791 cm–1 but can hardly be followed by IRAS
because of the low intensity of this band.

At 323 K, we clearly
observe a decrease in intensity of the CH2 stretching signal,
whereas the CH2 deformation
at 1450 cm–1 and the CH vibration at 2791 cm–1 completely vanish. At the same time, the band at
1542 cm–1 that we associated with H8-NEC
grows considerably. It remains visible up to temperatures of 423 K.
The low intensity of this band at 273 K indicates only partial conversion
of H12-NEC to H8-NEC up to this temperature,
whereas at 323 K, the H8-NEC species dominates (indicated
by both the increase in the band at 1542 cm–1 and
the disappearance of the CH vibrational mode). This observation matches
our HRXPS results discussed below.

It is noteworthy that the
CH2 stretching vibrations
are weakened in intensity and the CH3 stretching vibrations
completely disappear above 273 K. In contrast with the experiments
on Pd(111), weak signals are observed in the high-frequency region
up to the highest temperatures investigated. On Pd(111), practically
no IR bands are observed above 323 K. However, the decreasing IR band
intensities upon heating cannot necessarily be associated with desorption,
since H12-NEC fragments with very low IR activity may be
formed on the surface. Especially planar intermediates oriented parallel
on the surface lead to very low IR activity of most bands as a result
of the metal surface selection rule (MSSR).24,25 Computational studies by Sotoodeh and Smith on H8-NEC
on Pd(111) show that the pyrrole unit is oriented almost parallel
to the metal surface.20 Since the surface
coverage in our experiments above 273 K might be too high to allow
the favored flat orientation of H8-NEC on Pt(111),26 the C=C stretching mode at 1542 cm–1 becomes clearly visible at 323 K. In a flat-lying
orientation, the band would be very weak as a result of the MSSR and
due to the modified surface bonding with partial π and σ
character.27−31 The HRXPS experiments discussed below indeed verify the presence
of dehydrogenation and decomposition products in all temperature regimes.

Interestingly, we observe a decrease in the CH2 and
CH3 vibrational modes when heating from 273 to 473 K. As
stated above, the molecule dehydrogenates to H8-NEC between
273 and 323 K. Because C–H bond activation and dehydrogenation
to H8-NEC is not expected to affect CH2 or CH3 vibrations in a direct manner, we may speculate that weakening
of the bands at 2791, 2851, 2930, and 2963 cm–1 may
also result from a change in adsorption geometry. Finally, we note
that both HRXPS and TPMB analyses indicate further reactions at higher
temperature, namely, dehydrogenation of the six-membered rings and
C–N bond cleavage. Neither transformation could be directly
traced by IRAS, yet they may contribute to the weakening of CH2 and CH3 bands above 273 K.

Reaction Mechanisms of
H12-NEC on Pt(111) Studied
by HRXPS
Synchrotron radiation-based HRXPS allows us to follow
the reaction steps on the surface in great detail. This is done by
analyzing chemical shifts that reflect the chemical bonding and environment
of the atoms. The experiments were performed by first adsorbing H12-NEC on a clean Pt(111) surface at 250 K until saturation
was reached. Adsorption at this temperature prevents multilayer formation
(as IR shows in the previous section). Subsequently, a heating ramp
of 0.5 K s–1 was applied while the crystal was exposed
to H12-NEC at a constant background pressure of ∼8
× 10–9 mbar. This procedure constantly supplies
fully loaded LOHC molecules while heating and thereby mimics the conditions
of the TPMB experiment (see below). Because H12-NEC dehydrogenation
on real catalysts is performed around 500 K, we restrict ourselves
to temperatures below 600 K. Spectra were measured continuously, providing
complementary information to the IRAS and TPR experiments. Note that
in our previous study,23 a multilayer was
adsorbed, and the heating ramp was applied without continuous dosing.

For the C 1s and N 1s core levels, separate experiments under the
same conditions were performed. The complete data sets are shown in
Figure 2a and b in a color-coded density plot.
Note that there is an exposure and a temperature scale, since the
sample is exposed to the molecule in the gas phase even during heating.
Selected spectra, representative for the different species appearing
throughout the temperature ramp, are shown in Figure 2c and d. In addition, the quantitative analysis of the N 1s
(Figure 2a) and C 1s (Figure 2b) spectra as a function of exposure is shown in Figure 3.

N 1s spectra of the adsorption and reaction; (b) the respective analysis
of the C 1s region. The dashed lines indicate the start of the heating
ramp. Note that the H12-NEC signal and also the NEC signal
contain contributions from Hx-NEC (for
details, see text).

During the first part
of the experiments, H12-NEC is
dosed at constant temperature until saturation of the monolayer. Initially,
peaks at 401.6 eV in the N 1s and at 284.1 eV in the C 1s region develop.
Up to an exposure of ∼2 L (Langmuir; 1 L = 1.33 × 10–6 mbar·s), the C 1s peak shifts toward higher
binding energies (285.2 eV) while a shoulder at 284.1 eV remains.
In the N 1s region, another signal appears at 399.8 eV. From previous
work,23 the signals at 401.6 eV in the
N 1s region and 285.2 eV in the C 1s region are attributed to the
H12-NEC monolayer. The additional N 1s peak at 399.8 eV
is assigned to the partially dehydrogenated product H8-NEC.
Therefore, we suggest that the molecule partially dehydrogenates at
low coverage, whereas dehydrogenation is suppressed at saturation
as a result of space limitations. The latter may arise from adsorbed
hydrogen that may block reaction sites. Conversion to H8-NEC mainly changes the surroundings of the α-carbon atoms
of the pyrrole ring and, hence, can be observed in the N 1s region.

The quantitative analysis of the nitrogen peak areas (see Figure 3a) shows that, at saturation, ∼40% of H8-NEC coexists with 60% of H12-NEC. This situation
is also reflected in the C 1s region. For the quantitative analysis
of the C 1s spectra shown in Figure 3b, we
used envelopes consisting of two Doniach–Sunjic functions each,
for H12-NEC (main line at 285.2 eV) and NEC (main line
at 284.1 eV).23 These two peaks are an
envelope of the large variety of carbon atoms in different chemical
surroundings in the molecule and carbon atoms in different adsorption
positions on the surface and should not be mistaken as two distinct
chemical species. This assignment to only two different chemical species
cannot account for the stepwise dehydrogenation. However, if (in a
simplified picture) we consider the peak at 285.2 eV as arising mainly
from saturated carbon atoms of HX-NEC
(CH2/CH in the benzene/pyrrole ring) and the peak at 284.1
eV due to unsaturated carbon atoms of HX-NEC (CH/C in the benzene/pyrrole ring), we should be able to explain
the observed behavior. Indeed, by attributing the peak at 284.1 eV
to the four dehydrogenated pyrrole carbon atoms in H8-NEC,
the corresponding C 1s signal for complete conversion to H8-NEC should be 29% (4 out of 14 carbon atoms) of the total signal.
The observed intensity of 13% in Figure 3b
thus indicates a conversion of 45%, which is in close agreement to
the value of 40% derived from the N 1s spectra.

Next, we address
the thermal evolution of the adsorbed species.
In the N 1s region, the peak of the fully hydrogenated H12-NEC decreases at 280 K and vanishes completely at 340 K. This corresponds
to full dehydrogenation of the pyrrole ring, leaving only the peak
at 399.6 eV. No further changes can be seen up to 390 K. Note that,
depending on coverage, hydrogen desorbs from Pt(111) just below 300
K,32 which we believe to be connected with
the onset of further dehydrogenation at this temperature. This is
in good agreement with our IRAS results, where the band at 1542 cm–1 exhibits a strong increase at 323 K. In the C 1s
region, dehydrogenation is reflected by the increase in the signal
at 284.1 eV and a shift to 284.4 eV, as indicated in Figure 2d. Simultaneously, the peak at 285.2 eV steeply
decreases between 280 and 340 K before it vanishes completely at around
380 K. This indicates a further dehydrogenation that is visible only
in the C 1s core level because only carbon atoms other than those
of the pyrrole ring are affected. We can conclude that complete unloading
of the molecule occurs up to around 380 K, first by dehydrogenation
around the α-carbon atoms of the pyrrole ring to H8-NEC, followed by the stepwise dehydrogenation of the two outer rings
to NEC, resulting in the complete loss of CH2 subunits.

When the temperature exceeds 390 K, a new N 1s peak appears at
398.1 eV, while the intensity of the peak at 399.6 eV decreases. Following
our previous work, this peak is assigned to carbazole, an undesired
side product formed by dealkylation.31 This
reaction occurs directly at the nitrogen atom. In the C 1s region,
no comparably strong peak shift can be discerned because of a broadening
of the signal arising from the coexistence of many surface species.
At higher temperatures, new signals appear in both the N 1s and C
1s core levels that indicate further decomposition due to loss of
hydrogen, C–C bond scission, or both. In contrast with our
previous study,23 the total intensities
of both the N 1s and C 1s peaks rise in that temperature range because
of the continuous dosing. Obviously, the decomposition products allow
for denser packing on the surface.

Gas Phase Analysis via
TPMB Experiments
We performed
temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) experiments using quadrupole
mass spectrometry (QMS) to trace the formation of dehydrogenation
and decomposition products in the gas phase. H12-NEC was
dosed onto the surface using a supersonic molecular beam (MB) setup.
During deposition, the sample was heated from 150 to 650 K at a heating
rate of 2.8 K min–1. While heating, we exposed the
surface to a total of 20 pulses of H12-NEC. Details on
the experimental procedure are described in the Experimental
Section and in Figure 4. The QMS raw
data are shown in Figure 5a. We chose the following m/z ratios for analysis: 207 amu (H12-NEC), 205 amu (H10-NEC), 203 amu (H8-NEC), 199 amu (H4-NEC), and 195 amu (NEC). To obtain
additional information on the desorption of potential decomposition
products, we also recorded the above-mentioned molecules without ethyl
chain, that is, their carbazole analogues: 179 amu (H12-carbazole), 177 amu (H10-carbazole), 175 amu (H8-carbazole), 171 amu (H4-carbazole), and 167 amu (carbazole).
The obtained signals are displayed in Figure 5a (NEC derivatives in black, carbazole derivatives in gray). Note
that all signals (except the m/z signal at 207 amu) contain contributions from ionization-induced
fragmentation of the larger molecules in the mass spectrometer.

Figure 4 (a) Experimental
setup used for the IRAS and MB measurements described
in this work (see text for details). (b) MB source used for H12-NEC dosing. (c) Experimental procedure applied in the MB/QMS
gas phase analysis experiments with alternating off-time (i), reaction
data acquisition (ii), and reference interval (iii) (see the Experimental Section for details).

Figure 5 (a) QMS raw data acquired during the temperature-programmed
MB/QMS
experiment (see Figure 4 and the Experimental Section for details). The m/z values are attributed to the [M+] signals of
the following compounds (including fragmentation peaks): H12-NEC (m/z = 207), H12-carbazole (m/z = 179, ◇),
H10-NEC (m/z = 205, ■),
H10-carbazole (m/z =
177, □), H8-NEC (m/z = 203, ▲), H8-carbazole (m/z = 175, Δ), H4-NEC (m/z = 199, ●), H4-carbazole (m/z = 171, ○), NEC (m/z = 195, ▼), and carbazole (m/z = 167, ▽). (b) Gas-phase product traces
after subtraction of the fragmentation pattern (see text for details).
(c) Integrated gas-phase product peaks as a function of the dosing
temperature for each H12-NEC pulse. The 12th pulse was
excluded due to an operation error.

From the 207-amu signal, we conclude that almost no desorption
H12-NEC occurs up to ∼210 K (corresponding to pulses
1 and 2), indicating a sticking coefficient near unity at low temperatures.
This is in agreement with the IRAS data, for which multilayer formation
was observed to vanish between 173 and 223 K.

Above 210 K, desorption
is indicated by the continuous increase
in the signal at 207 amu. In our previous experiments on Pd(111),
we observed a strong desorption peak with a maximum at 210 K, arising
from desorption of an accumulated multilayer.18

Because of the adsorption/desorption of H12-NEC
and
its products at the chamber walls, the effective pumping is reduced.
This is reflected in the shape of the gas pulses, which are not rectangular
but show an exponential tailing (see also our previous work with H12-NEC on Pd(111)18). The variation
in pulse heights in the 207 amu signal is ascribed to variations in
the H12-NEC beam intensity. These are caused by changes
in the MB source temperature and the decreasing filling level in the
H12-NEC reservoir and are inevitable during a 3-h-long
experiment. By normalization to the H12-NEC signal, we
compensate for these variations in the other m/z signals. Note that this procedure does not affect the
following discussion.

To identify reaction products, we analyze
the QMS signals for possible
dehydrogenation products with and without dealkylation. With the new
pulsing procedure described in the Experimental Section, we are now able to determine the precise cracking pattern and flux
of the reactant at each pulse. This information is used to remove
the H12-NEC contribution (due to its cracking pattern)
from the raw data of all mass signals. The resulting data (Figure 5b) represent the desorbing dehydrogenation and decomposition
products only. Figure 5c depicts the integrated
intensities of these products per pulse as a function of temperature.

The results indicate that H12-carbazole (179 amu), H10-NEC (205 amu), and H10-carbazole (177 amu) are
below the detection limit over the entire temperature range. The small
residual signals are due to inaccuracies of the data treatment procedure
described above; however, we clearly identify H8-NEC (203
amu) and its dealkylated counterpart H8-carbazole (175
amu) as the two main reaction products in the gas phase. As can be
seen in Figure 5c, both fragments begin to
desorb at ∼390 K. Interestingly, the 175 amu signal exceeds
the 203 amu signal from the onset of desorption to the end of the
experiment. With increasing temperature, the formation rate for both
H8-NEC and H8-carbazole increases before it
levels off at 600 K. Disregarding the differences in ionization probability,
we estimate the average reaction probabilities to H8-NEC
and H8-carbazole (relative to incoming H12-NEC
flux) to 2.8% and 4.4%, respectively (temperature range 390–650
K). It is important to mention that ionization-induced fragmentation
of H8-NEC (203 amu) in the mass spectrometer also contributes
to the H8-carbazole signal (175 amu). Comparison with H12-NEC and NEC33 suggests, however,
that this contribution is minor. Therefore, we conclude that, indeed,
H8-NEC and H8-carbazole are the main products
desorbing from the surface. Note furthermore that C–N bond
scission is also observed on real catalysts, but with much lower probability.
We attribute this difference to the presence of coadsorbates and molecular
fragments on the surface under ambient reaction conditions; this effect
will be the focus of future studies.

As discussed before, we
identified H8-NEC as the first
stable reaction intermediate in IRAS. The onset for H8-NEC
formation occurred around 223 K, in agreement with our XPS data, where
H8-NEC is identified at 250 K in both the N 1s and C 1s
regions. The surface coverage of H8-NEC increases with
temperature. Release into the gas phase at 390 K is reflected by a
decrease in the corresponding signal in XPS.

At this point,
we cannot clearly identify any further dehydrogenation
or decomposition products in the gas phase, such as H4-NEC/H4-carbazole and NEC/carbazole, yet the slight increase in the
corresponding signals as a function of temperature suggests that these
products are formed with substantially lower reaction probability
(note that on a real catalyst, intermediates will readsorb and be
further dehydrogenated, whereas under UHV conditions, this is not
possible). Our HRXPS experiments revealed, however, that up to 390
K, more strongly dehydrogenated products, such as H4-NEC
and NEC, are formed on the surface. The same observation has been
made previously in HRXPS experiments using a different experimental
procedure.23 It is likely that transformations
occurring during these dehydrogenation steps are coupled to major
changes in the bonding geometry of the molecules to the surface.20,34,35 Such changes in molecular orientation
may give rise to the binding energy shift observed in XPS and to the
decreasing IRAS intensity when heating to 473 K. It is noteworthy
that H8-NEC/H8-carbazole are the dominating
dehydrogenation product in the gas phase. These species are formed
in the presence of stronger dehydrogenated species present on the
surface. The low intensity of H4-NEC and NEC and their
dealkylated counterparts in TPMB, despite the fact that these species
are formed, may be explained by their strong interaction with the
surface. As a result of π-bonding, these species will prefer
a flat-lying orientation and enhanced bonding to the surface.29,34,35 Thus, adsorption of H8-NEC is expected to require less space on the surface than stronger
dehydrogenated species (Hn-NEC, n < 8). As a result of this ensemble effect, the dehydrogenation
rate to H4-NEC and NEC is expected to decrease on a surface
partly covered with dehydrogenation intermediates. Thus, the selectivity
is shifted to H8-NEC, which then partly decomposes to H8-carbazole and desorbs.

Because the temperature threshold
for H8-NEC and H8-carbazole desorption marks
the start of decomposition via
C–N bond scission, we speculate that dealkylation may be facilitated
by H8-NEC desorption (as the products of dealkylation will
require additional adsorption sites). Below 390 K, abstraction of
the ethyl side chain might be suppressed by accumulated dehydrogenation
intermediates, which partly cover the surface and thereby limit the
number of potential reaction sites. Alternatively, the temperature
of 390 K might simply reflect the temperature required for dealkylation
on Pt(111).

Conclusion
We investigated the adsorption
and reaction of H12-NEC
on Pt(111) under UHV conditions by IRAS, MB methods, and synchrotron
radiation-based HRXPS.

Molecular adsorption of H12-NEC occurs up to temperatures
between 173 and 223 K without any indication for reaction and with
a sticking coefficient near unity. Desorption of the physisorbed multilayer
takes place below 223 K.

C–H bond activation at the α-carbon
atoms was identified
as the initial step of dehydrogenation, starting at ∼223 K.
We identified H8-NEC as the first stable surface intermediate.
Upon heating, the H12-NEC monolayer gradually dehydrogenates
to H8-NEC, with a conversion of 40% as soon as the H12-NEC multilayer is desorbed. The reaction drastically accelerates
at 300 K, which is associated with an increasing number of free surface
sites due to hydrogen desorption at this temperature.

At temperatures
up to 380 K, transformation of the CH2 units to CH within
the six-membered rings indicates stepwise dehydrogenation
to the final product NEC. The reaction involves a change in adsorption
geometry to a flat-lying orientation.

Above 390 K, dehydrogenation
of H12-NEC competes with
dealkylation, that is, abstraction of the ethyl side chain via C–N
bond scission. Dealkylation may be triggered by a decreasing surface
coverage at the onset of desorption. Above 420 K, further C–C
bond cleavage leads to formation of smaller molecular fragments and
atomic species.

A new TPMB procedure permits identification
of desorbing products
in the gas phase. We identify H8-carbazole and H8-NEC as the main species desorbing from the surface. Desorption starts
at 390 K and reaches a maximum at ∼600 K. Partial blocking
of adsorption sites by strongly bound intermediates is responsible
for a shift in selectivity from strong dehydrogenation (e.g., to H4-NEC and NEC) on the clean surface to partial dehydrogenation
to H8-NEC on the precovered catalyst. As a result, only
minor amounts of H4-NEC or NEC desorb up to 650 K.

A comparison with our previous studies on the reaction of H12-NEC on Pd(111) reveals that the reaction mechanism is very
similar. However, the onset of C–N bond scission is shifted
to substantially higher temperature on Pt(111) (390 K, i.e., ∼60
K higher as compared with Pd(111)). The temperature threshold for
desorption of H8-NEC shows a concomitant shift. These differences
are associated with the different interaction and adsorption energies
of the primary intermediate H8-NEC on Pt(111) and on Pd(111).

Experimental
Section
UHV IRAS and MB Setup
IRAS and TPMB measurements were
performed in a UHV system described elsewhere (base pressure below
2 × 10–10 mbar).36 For both experiments, H12-NEC was deposited via a molecular
beam (MB) setup, which is schematically shown in Figure 4a. By applying this technique, a collision-free environment
is established, that is, any contact of H12-NEC with the
chamber walls prior to interaction with the catalyst surface is avoided.
For further details on this technique and its application in model
catalysis, see, for example, refs (37−40). The MB source, which is connected to the UHV system, consists of
three differentially pumped stages. The expansion chamber is pumped
by an oil diffusion pump (pumping speed ∼3000 L s–1), and the second and third stages are pumped with turbomolecular
pumps (500 and 60 L s–1, respectively). The MB source
features a variable beam-defining aperture. The beam diameter was
chosen to slightly exceed the dimensions of the sample (9 × 11
mm). The beam was aligned, and its intensity was calibrated using
a beam monitor, consisting of a movable stainless steel tube with
an aperture of 1 mm diameter. The stagnation pressure inside the tube
was measured using a highly stable ionization gauge (Granville-Phillips
Stabil Ion). For an Ar beam at 300 K, effective pressures of up to
5 × 10–6 mbar are obtained at the sample position.

The H12-NEC beam was generated using a high-temperature
saturator cell located inside the expansion chamber (see Figure 4b). Ar (Linde, 99.9999%) as a carrier gas was bubbled
through a reservoir of H12-NEC, kept at around 100 °C.
The fraction of H12-NEC vapor in the carrier gas was controlled
by the temperature of the H12-NEC reservoir. Ar was used
to avoid strong seeding effects, that is, the generation of H12-NEC with high kinetic energies in the supersonic expansion.
The Ar/H12-NEC mixture was expanded through a 0.3 mm nozzle
into the expansion chamber. All parts of the nozzle setup were individually
heated to temperatures slightly above the reservoir temperature to
avoid unintended condensation of H12-NEC. The molar fraction
of H12-NEC vapor in the carrier gas was then controlled
by the temperature of the H12-NEC reservoir. By comparison
of the IR spectra at low sample temperature with those obtained with
the PVD doser, which is also equipped to the UHV chamber described
above, we obtain an estimated H12-NEC flux from the MB
source of ∼1–3 monolayer/min.18

For preparation of the model system for the IRAS and QMS experiments,
a Pt(111) single crystal (MaTecK GmbH) was cleaned by several cycles
of Ar+ sputtering (E = 1.5 keV, 8 ×
10–5 mbar Ar, 300 K) annealing (1200 K) and oxidation
(5 × 10–7 mbar O2, 700 K) in vacuum.
The quality of the Pt(111) single crystal was controlled by low energy
electron diffraction (LEED). In addition, prior to H12-NEC
adsorption, IRAS experiments were conducted to monitor the cleanliness
of the surface by CO adsorption experiments at 100 and 300 K.

IRAS Experiments
All IRAS experiments were performed
with a vacuum FTIR spectrometer (Bruker IFS 66/v) coupled to the UHV
system. During deposition, IR spectra were continuously acquired in
a time-resolved fashion with a spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. The acquisition time per spectrum was 60 s.

QMS Experiments
The reaction products formed during
our temperature-programmed QMS/MB experiments were identified using
a non-line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometer in single ion counting
mode (Hiden HAL511/PIC), which is connected to the UHV system. In
previous experiments, we found that the cracking pattern of H12-NEC, which superimposes the QMS signals of true surface
reactions, does not remain constant on the time scale of the experiment.
This may be explained by unsteady environmental and instrumental conditions
(e.g., accumulation of H12-NEC on the chamber walls). For
this reason, we developed a dosing procedure that enables us to trace
and subtract the fluctuating fragmentation behavior. The experimental
procedure applied is depicted in Figure 4c.
The sample was heated from 150 to 650 K at a constant heating rate
of 2.8 K min–1. During the temperature ramp, the
sample was exposed to 20 H12-NEC pulses, each with a duration
of 3 min (ii). The pulsing was performed with an automatic shutter
in the second differential pumping stage (shutter I) and a shutter
situated directly in front of the sample (shutter II). The sample
is exposed to H12-NEC when both shutters are open. Accordingly,
the QMS data recorded within this interval contains the “real”
signals of all reactants and products. For detecting the contributions
arising from ionization-induced fragmentation within the QMS, each
pulse was followed by an off time of 2 × 3 min. During the first
3 min (iii), we interrupted the H12-NEC beam with shutter
II. The latter ensures that no adsorption (and no reaction) on the
sample takes place, while H12-NEC is dosed into the UHV
chamber. As a consequence, from this “reference” signal,
we can calculate the fraction of QMS-induced cracking of each pulse.
These signals are then subtracted from the raw data. After closing
both shutters for 3 min (i), the next pulse was performed. In this
manner, we are able to differentiate varying background signals and
true surface reactions.

UHV XPS Experiments
The XPS measurements
were carried
out at beamline U 49/2 PGM 1 at the third generation synchrotron BESSY
II of Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin using a transportable UHV setup.41 In addition to typical surface science tools
such as a sputter gun and LEED, a supersonic molecular beam is attached.
The sample can be cooled to 120 K using liquid nitrogen and heated
to 1400 K using direct heating. For the TPXPS experiments, an additional
filament is situated in the back of the crystal to allow for careful
heating. This way, we can continuously obtain unperturbed XP spectra
for both the adsorption and heating experiments. The time per spectrum
was typically on the order of 10 s per spectrum. Moreover, for this
particular study, a dosing unit dedicated to the adsorption of H12-NEC and NEC was attached directly to the main chamber. The
coverage calibration, as used in the quantitative analysis (Figure 3), was carried out using the known carbon surface
coverage of the c(4 × 2) CO superstructure on Pt(111).42 The fitting procedure included the subtraction
of the background and the usage of Doniach–Sunjic functions43 convoluted with a Gaussian for peak fitting.
In the N 1s region, one fit function was used, whereas in the C 1s
region, line shapes were used for each species, consisting of two
such functions. Because of adsorption from residual gas, there is
also a low amount (<0.1 ML) of CO adsorbed on the surface, which
was fitted by one function. This approach is similar to the one used
in our previous study,23 described in detail
in the respective Supporting Information. The XP spectra were taken using an excitation energy of 380 eV
(C 1s) and 500 eV (N 1s), and the resolution was 150 meV (C 1s) and
220 meV (N 1s).

Synthesis of H12-NEC
H12-NEC
was synthesized by heating 220 g of NEC (>97%; CAS: 86-28-2, Clariant)
in a 600-mL steel autoclave equipped with a gas entrainer stirrer
until liquefaction at 85 °C. Subsequently, 10 g of Ru on Al2O3 (5% on support) (Alfa Aesar), 5 g of Pd on Al2O3 (5% on support) (Johnson Matthey), and 4 g MgO
(Clariant) were added. The autoclave was closed and purged five times
with nitrogen (Linde, 99.999%). The autoclave was then heated to the
reaction temperature of 150 °C. Hydrogen (Linde, 99.999%) was
introduced at a constant pressure of 65 bar. The stirrer was set to
1200 rpm, and the reaction was started. After 72 h of reaction, the
autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the product removed from
the autoclave, and the catalyst was filtered. Product distillation
yielded H12-NEC with a purity above 99% in a mixture of
three conformers.
