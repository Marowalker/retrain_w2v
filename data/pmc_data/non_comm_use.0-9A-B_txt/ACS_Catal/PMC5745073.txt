We report the use of cationic gold
complexes [Au(NHC)(CH3CN)][BF4] and [{Au(NHC)}2(μ–OH)][BF4] (NHC = N-heterocyclic
carbene) as highly active catalysts
in the solvent-free hydroalkoxylation of internal alkynes using primary
and secondary alcohols. Using this simple protocol, a broad range
of (Z)-vinyl ethers were obtained in excellent yields
and high stereoselectivities. The methodology allows for the use of
catalyst loadings as low as 200 ppm for the addition of primary alcohols
to internal alkynes (TON = 35 000, TOF = 2188 h–1).

==== Body
The development of synthetic
methods for the formation of C–O bonds is of great interest
in synthetic organic chemistry. A very effective approach is the addition
of alcohol O–H bonds across unsaturated C–C bonds in
inter- or intramolecular fashion to provide ethers.1 To avoid the use of harsh reaction conditions2 and/or the need for strong bases,3 these hydroalkoxylation reactions are usually performed
employing metal-catalyzed conditions. Numerous procedures have been
developed that make use of complexes of Cu,4 Zn,5 Hg,6 Ru,7 Rh,8 Ir,9 Pd,10 Pt,11 Au,12 or Th13 as catalysts. These catalytic procedures are
desirable over substitution reactions (that would form the same products)
because the method avoids the generation of stoichiometric amounts
of waste.14

The rapid growth of the
field of homogeneous gold catalysis has
resulted in the development of a vast number of gold-catalyzed organic
transformations, most of which rely on the ability of cationic gold
complexes to activate unsaturated C–C bonds.15 While gold-catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation reactions
have been successfully employed in the synthesis of various heterocycles16 and natural products,17 reports on the more challenging intermolecular hydroalkoxylation
reactions remain scarce.18 Teles and co-workers
were the first to report intermolecular hydroalkoxylation of terminal
alkynes.18a The groups of Corma and Sahoo
later achieved the addition of secondary and tertiary alcohols as
well as phenols to internal alkynes.18b,18c These reports
have established that internal alkynes are more challenging substrates
in hydroalkoxylation reactions compared to their terminal congeners.
Although monoaddition to alkynes had already been demonstrated to
be difficult, other challenges remain in terms of chemoselectivity,
stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and substrate scope (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Common Side-Products Formed in Hydroalkoxylation
Reactions
Cationic gold complexes
[Au(NHC)(CH3CN)][BF4] and [{Au(NHC)}2(μ–OH)][BF4]
(NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) have been demonstrated to be highly
active catalysts in various silver- and acid-free gold-catalyzed transformations.19 Herein, we showcase their efficiency to achieve
good chemo- and stereoselectivity in hydroalkoxylation reactions of
internal alkynes.

We first examined the addition of 1-phenylethanol
(3a) to diphenylacetylene (2a), catalyzed
by 1 mol % [{Au(IPr)}2(μ–OH)][BF4] (1a) in
toluene at 80 °C (Table 1, entry 1; IPr
= 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene). After 18 h, full
conversion was observed (as monitored by GC) with high chemoselectivity,
90% of the desired vinyl ether 4a and only 10% of its
corresponding hydrolysis product 5,18c,18d,20 and stereoselectivity of 98%
(Z)-4a. To the best of our knowledge,
hydroalkoxylation reactions have not been reported previously with
secondary benzylic alcohols.18c Moreover,
we were delighted to see that the corresponding acetal, resulting
from the addition of two molecules of 3a to 2a, was not detected. Interestingly, the use of Gagosz-type monogold
[Au(IPr)(NTf2)],21 resulted
in poor reactivity (Table 1, entry 2). Gratifyingly,
better chemoselectivity and faster reactions were obtained under solvent-free
conditions (Table 1, entry 3). Other NHC ligands
were then tested using lower catalyst loading (0.3 mol %, Table 1, entries 4–6). Catalysts 1a and 1b bearing IPr and SIPr ligands gave very similar
chemoselectivities. The catalyst bearing the least electron-donating
NHC ligand, 4,5-dichloro-1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imid-azol-2-ylidene
(IPrCl) [{Au(IPrCl)}2(μ–OH)][BF4] (1c) enhanced the reactivity but reduced the
chemoselectivity. The use of solvate monogold complexes [Au(NHC)(CH3CN)][BF4] 1d and 1e as
catalysts led to a large decrease in chemoselectivity (Table 1, entries 7–8). We concluded that the hydroalkoxylation
reaction could be performed most effectively using 0.3 mol % of [{Au(SIPr)}2(μ–OH)][BF4] (1b) or
[{Au(IPrCl)}2(μ–OH)][BF4] (1c) at 80 °C under solvent-free conditions.
Indeed, after carrying out these hydroalkoxylation reactions for 2
h (Table 1, entries 9–10), the desired
vinyl ether 4a was formed with high chemoselectivity
and stereoselectivity, 96% and 95% (Z)-4a, respectively.

We
evaluated the performance of both 1b and 1c in the hydroalkoxylation reactions of diphenylacetylene
(2a) with various secondary benzylic alcohols 3a–l (Scheme 2). Substituents
at the ortho, meta, and para positions of the aryl group of 1-phenylethanol derivatives
were tolerated, and the corresponding vinyl ethers 4a–e were obtained in good yields. Interestingly,
the electronic properties of the aryl group of the alcohol did not
affect the stereoselectivity of the reaction, and the (Z)-isomer was obtained predominantly in all cases. Importantly, the
hydroalkoxylation reaction of (S)-1-phenylethanol
was found to produce one enantiomer of the vinyl ether with 1b or 1c as catalysts.

Scheme 2 Hydroalkoxylation
of Alkynes Using Various Secondary Benzylic Alcohols
Reaction conditions: 2a (0.50 mmol), 3a–o (0.55 mmol, 1.1
equiv), 1b or 1c (0.3 mol %), neat, 80 °C,
in air. The catalyst giving the best result, reaction time, yield
of isolated product and Z/E ratio
of product are given in parentheses. The results for the other catalyst
are given in the Supporting Information.

Changing the methyl moiety at the α′-position
of the
alcohol (3f–i) required longer reaction
times for the transformation to reach completion. Interestingly, substitution
of this methyl group with an isopropyl (3f) or trifluoromethyl
(3g) group led to a reversal in selectivity and gave
instead (E)-vinyl ethers 4f and 4g as main products. We hypothesized that this change in selectivity
was linked to the electronic nature of the substituent in the α′-position.
The addition of methyl mandelate 3h to 2a, however, resulted again in the predominant formation of (Z)-vinyl ether 4h. Mandelonitrile 3i did not undergo the reaction, most likely because of competitive
coordination of the catalyst to the triple bond of the nitrile moiety.
We also tested benzhydrol (3j) and derivatives 3k,l under these reaction conditions. Longer
reaction times were required to reach completion in these instances,
as these possess increased steric bulk. Nonetheless, the corresponding
(Z)-vinyl ethers 4j–l were obtained in modest yields with excellent stereoselectivities.

The reactivity of various symmetrical and unsymmetrical internal
alkynes 2b–j was evaluated next (Scheme 3). Despite the need for longer reaction times,22 the hydroalkoxylation reactions of unsymmetrical
diaryl-substituted alkynes 2b–f proceeded
well. The corresponding vinyl ethers 4m–p were isolated in good yields as mixtures of regioisomers
with high stereoselectivity favoring the (Z)-isomer.
A preferential addition to the less electron-rich center was observed
when NO2 or MeO substituents were present, (alkynes 2b,c, vinyl ethers 4m,n), whereas a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers was obtained with 1-chloro-4-(phenylethynyl)benzene
(alkyne 2d, vinyl ether 4o) that lacks such
a substituent. With both MeO and Cl substituents at the para positions of the phenyl rings (alkyne 2e, vinyl ether 4p), the preference of addition to the less electron-rich
center was restored.

Alcohol condensation side-product (oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl))dibenzene
was observed as the major product.

5 was observed as the major product.

A complex mixture formed.

Next, hydroalkoxylation with symmetrical alkynes was evaluated.
The reaction of strongly activated dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate
(DMAD, 2f) with 3a afforded a 1:1 mixture
of the desired vinyl ether 4q, with complete stereoselectivity
toward the (E)-vinyl ether, along with alcohol condensation
side-product (oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl))dibenzene.23 In agreement with the report of Teles and co-workers, the
hydroalkoxylation reactions of 1,4-bis(2-thiophene)butyne 2g, 4-octyne 2h and 1,4-dichlorobutyne 2i to form vinyl ethers 4r–t were
unsuccessful under these reaction
conditions.18a Replacing one phenyl group
of diphenylacetylene 2a with a methyl (2j) hampered the hydroalkoxylation reaction and led to the formation
of a complex mixture of products instead of the vinyl ether 4u. The hydroalkoxylation reaction of phenylacetylene 2k led to the formation of a complex mixture of products.
Digold hydroxide catalysts [{Au(NHC)}2(μ–OH)][BF4] are known to be able to dissociate into a Lewis acidic [Au(NHC)][BF4] and a Brønsted basic [Au(NHC)(OH)] component.24 Competitive deprotonation of the acetylenic
proton of phenylacetylene by the latter might explain the incompatibility
with this substrate.25 Attempts to form
vinyl ether 4v by using non-Brønsted basic catalysts 1d or 1e, however, were unsuccessful and ketone 5 and (oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl))dibenzene formed as the sole
products.

To assess the efficiency of catalyst 1b, once the
reaction between alkyne 2a and alcohol 3a was complete, iterative additions of both substrates (0.5 and 0.55
mmol, respectively) were performed. As a result, 2.5 mmol of 2a was converted to 4a over 12 h, affording a
high turnover number (TON) of 840 and a modest turnover frequency
(TOF) of 70 h–1. In addition, the performance of
the new digold hydroxide catalyst (1c) was evaluated
by conducting the hydroalkoxylation reaction between 2a (5.0 mmol) and 3a (5.5 mmol) on a gram scale using
0.3 mol % 1c. This reaction afforded vinyl ether 4a in excellent yield (1.4 g, 94%) without loss of stereoselectivity
(Z/E = 98/2).

Previous studies
examining gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation reactions
have used aliphatic alcohols such as MeOH, i-PrOH, n-BuOH, and BnOH as model substrates.18a,18c Their addition to diphenylacetylene (2a) proceeded
smoothly at room temperature using 1c as catalyst and
the corresponding vinyl ethers were obtained in excellent yields and
selectivities (Table 2). As reported previously,
the reactivity increases from i-PrOH to MeOH by 1
order of magnitude (Table 2, entries 1 and
4).18a These results constitute a significant
improvement compared to previous catalyst systems with regards to
reaction conditions, catalyst loading, and chemo- and stereoselectivity.18c

We compared
the performance of monogold catalyst 1e to digold hydroxide
catalyst 1c for the addition of
MeOH to diphenylacetylene (2a). We found that monogold
catalyst 1e was more active in the addition of MeOH than
digold hydroxide catalyst 1c, but the selectivity toward
the (Z)-vinyl ether decreased to 85% (Table 2, entry 5). We found that monogold catalyst 1e was much more active than digold hydroxide catalyst 1c when the catalyst loading was drastically decreased (Table 2, entries 6, 7). Indeed, while the formation of
vinyl ether 6d stopped after 50% conversion using 250
ppm of digold 1c, this product could be isolated in quantitative
yield and complete stereoselectivity after 16 h using only
200 ppm of monogold catalyst 1e. This catalyst
loading enables a very high TON of 35 000 and a TOF of 2188
h-1.

We continued
to examine the difference between catalysts 1c and 1e at different loadings in the hydroalkoxylation
reaction of MeOH and DMAD (2f) (Table 3). This transformation proceeded rapidly at room temperature
and reached completion after 3 h using either catalyst (Table 3, entries 1, 2). Interestingly, the corresponding
(E)-vinyl ether 6e was obtained selectively.
At reduced catalyst loadings, however, we observed the formation of
(Z)-6e after 2 h (Z/E = 15/85 at 55% conversion for digold catalyst 1c and Z/E = 33/67 at 24%
conversion for monogold catalyst 1e), which was then
predominantly converted to (E)-6e after
prolonged reaction time (Table 3, entries 3,
4). These results suggest that the hydroalkoxylation reaction and
the subsequent isomerization are competitive processes.

Corma and
co-workers have proposed a mechanism to account for the
conversion of (Z)-vinyl ethers into (E)-vinyl ethers.18c This mechanism involves
a trans-addition of a second molecule of alcohol
to the (Z)-vinyl ether and subsequent cis-elimination to form the (E)-vinyl ether (Scheme 4). Alternatively, a thermal process or rotation
around the C–C bond of the vinylgold intermediate could be
envisioned.26 This latter route would be
particularly fast for vinyl ethers from DMAD because of its ability
to be involved in keto–enol tautomerization.

Scheme 4 Proposed Isomerization
of (Z)-Vinyl Ethers to (E)-Vinyl
Ethers18c
To shed light on the isomerization process, the direct
isomerization
reactions of pure vinyl ethers (Z)-4a and (Z)-6d catalyzed by digold catalyst 1c and monogold catalyst 1e were surveyed (Table 4). As expected from the high stereoselectivity obtained
in reactions (Schemes 2 and 3) involving 1-phenylethanol (3a), isomerization
of vinyl ether (Z)-4a was found to be
slow (Table 4, entries 1, 2). Appreciable isomerization
was only observed in the presence of 1-phenylethanol (3a) and monogold catalyst 1e (Table 4, entry 3). We found that isomerization of (Z)-6d occurred spontaneously at 80 °C and was accelerated
when catalytic amounts of either the mono- or digold hydroxide catalyst
was added (Table 4, entries 4–6). No
appreciable isomerization was observed at lower temperatures, and
the proposed acetal intermediates were never observed. These results
suggest that the isomerization process from (Z)-vinyl
ethers to (E)-vinyl ethers occurs spontaneously at
elevated temperature and is accelerated by cationic gold species,
but the process does not involve or require the addition of a second
molecule of alcohol.

We further
probed whether the vinyl ether products could be transformed
into other vinyl ethers. To this end, we subjected vinyl-ether 6d and CD3OD to catalytic conditions (Scheme 5). Apart from the previously observed Z/E isomerization, no formation of acetal or incorporation
of CD3O was observed. The reverse experiment, the reaction
of d4-6d with MeOH, gave
an analogous result. The incorporation of small amounts of deuterium
in the vinylic position suggests the formation of a alkylgold species
(as in Scheme 4) that is subsequently deuterodeaurated
under these conditions.

Scheme 5 Reaction of (Z)-6d with CD3OD
Z/E ratios are determined by 1H NMR analysis. Deuterium
content
was determined by 1H NMR analysis and confirmed by 2D NMR analysis.

In conclusion, we
have demonstrated that both [Au(NHC)(CH3CN)][BF4] and [{Au(NHC)}2(μ–OH)][BF4]
complexes are highly effective catalysts for the stereoselective
intermolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkynes. Their use under solvent-free
conditions constitutes a practical, operationally simple, and scalable
strategy for the assembly of a range of new vinyl ethers in high yields.
In particular, [Au(IPrCl)(CH3CN)][BF4] (1e) has been shown to be highly active in the addition
of aliphatic alcohols to internal alkynes. Experiments have also revealed
that monogold and digold hydroxide catalysts display different behavior
in the isomerization of the two stereoisomers of the vinyl ethers
at different catalyst loadings. Further synthetic and mechanistic
studies focusing on the catalytic uses of these complexes are ongoing
in our laboratories.
