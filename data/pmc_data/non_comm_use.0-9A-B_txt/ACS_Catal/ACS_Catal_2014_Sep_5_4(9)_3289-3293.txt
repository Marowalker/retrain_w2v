The
nickel-catalyzed amination of aryl O-sulfamates
and chlorides using the green solvent 2-methyl-THF is reported. This
methodology employs the commercially available and air-stable precatalyst
NiCl2(DME), is broad in scope, and provides access to aryl
amines in synthetically useful yields. The utility of this methodology
is underscored by examples of gram-scale couplings conducted with
catalyst loadings as low as 1 mol % nickel. Moreover, the nickel-catalyzed
amination described is tolerant of heterocycles and should prove useful
in the synthesis of pharmaceutical candidates and other heteroatom-containing
compounds.

Transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings
have had a profound impact on chemical synthesis.1 As mild and useful alternatives to classical fragment couplings,
cross-couplings have become one of the most frequently employed transformations
for the construction of carbon–carbon (C–C) and carbon–heteroatom
(C–X) bonds in both academic and industrial settings.1 Although palladium-catalyzed couplings dominate
the field, there has been growing interest in the development of related
couplings that employ nonprecious metals.2 Nickel, in particular, is very attractive in part due to its wide
availability and low cost.2d−2h Additionally, certain nickel catalysts have the unique ability to
activate a wide range of electrophilic coupling partners, well beyond
the scope of traditional cross-couplings that use palladium catalysis.2d−2h Moreover, in addition to cost and reactivity benefits, nickel catalysis
has shown great promise for operating under green reaction conditions,3 particularly in green solvents.4

Our research group and others have developed new
protocols for
aryl C–C and C–N bond formation5 using nickel catalysis.2d−2h,4,6−8 These procedures not only enable the desired bond
formations but often also utilize air and moisture stable Ni(II) precatalysts
that do not require glovebox handling. To render these transformations
more practical, we have recently focused our efforts on developing
greener variants. This has led to a general nickel-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling procedure that takes place in a variety of green solvents,
is scalable at low catalyst loadings, and possesses an unusually broad
substrate scope.4 Herein, we report a complementary
procedure for the efficient formation of aryl C–N bonds that
proceeds in a green solvent using nickel catalysis (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Amination of (hetero)aryl chlorides and sulfamates in
a green solvent
using nickel catalysis.

Having previously
established the nickel-catalyzed amination of
aryl sulfamates,7g,7j albeit not in a green solvent,
we sought to first develop the corresponding coupling of aryl chlorides.
We chose naphthyl chloride 1a for our studies and tested
its coupling with morpholine (2) using nickel catalysis
(Table 1). Indeed, upon exposure of 1a and 2 to our previously disclosed sulfamate amination
conditions,7g,7j,9,10 product 4 was obtained when
toluene was used as the solvent (entry 1). Other solvents that have
some attractive attributes were also tested.11,12 The use of DMF gave 4 in 50% yield (entry 2). We also
examined alcohol solvents. Although the desired coupling did not take
place when n-butanol was employed (entry 3), we found
that the use of t-amyl alcohol gave the aminated
product in good yield (entry 4). Ethereal solvents were also tested.
Fortunately, the use of THF, MTBE, CPME,13 or 2-Me-THF (entries 5–8, respectively) uniformly furnished 4 in excellent yield.

Table 1 Examination of Solvents
in the Amination
of 1-Chloronaphthalenea
a Reactions
were carried out with
NiCl2(DME) (5 mol %), SIPr·HCl (10 mol %), Ph-B(pin)
(0.55 equiv), substrate (0.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv), morpholine (1.80 equiv),
NaOtBu (1.85 equiv), hexamethylbenzene (0.10 equiv),
and solvent (used as received, 2.5 mL), for 3 h.

b Yields were determined using hexamethylbenzene
as an internal standard.

Of the solvents surveyed, we elected to focus on the use of 2-Me-THF
for our subsequent studies.14 2-Me-THF
has gained attention as a promising solvent for industrial applications15 due to several salient features, including the
following: (a) it is not easily oxidized; (b) it readily phase-separates
from aqueous layers (in contrast to THF); (c) it is obtained from
furfural, which in turn comes from renewable feedstock; (d) it has
a higher boiling point compared to THF, which can be advantageous
in some instances; and (e) it poses minimal health risks.

After
establishing suitable reaction conditions for the amination
of 1a with morpholine (2), we probed the
use of other 1-naphthyl-based electrophilic coupling partners 1 in this methodology (Table 2). We
were delighted to find that 1-bromonaphthalene could also be employed
(entry 2). However, the corresponding iodide and triflate substrates
gave only modest yields of 4 (entries 3 and 4). The use
of a tosylate coupling partner, on the other hand, led to the desired
product in 71% yield (entry 5). Finally, whereas the pivalate ester
substrate failed (entry 6), we found that the corresponding carbamate
and sulfamate substrates could be employed in the methodology (entries
7 and 8). Overall, the chloride and sulfamate substrates gave the
best yields of product 4; thus, we elected to evaluate
the scope of the methodology for these two types of electrophiles.16,17

Table 2 Evaluation of Various Electrophilesa
a Reactions were carried out with
NiCl2(DME) (5 mol %), SIPr·HCl (10 mol %), Ph–B(pin)
(0.55 equiv), substrate (0.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv), morpholine (1.80 equiv),
NaOtBu (1.85 equiv), hexamethylbenzene (0.10 equiv),
and solvent (used as received, 2.5 mL), for 3 h.

b Yields were determined using hexamethylbenzene
as an internal standard.

Figure 2 highlights the scope of the methodology
with regard to the coupling of aryl sulfamate substrates using morpholine
(2) as the amine partner and 2-Me-THF as the solvent.
Simple aryl hydrocarbon substrates, such as naphthyl and phenyl sulfamates,
were readily aminated as demonstrated by the high yielding formation
of 4 and 5, respectively. Additionally,
the generation of products 6–9 in
good yields shows the methodology’s tolerance of electron-donating,
electron-withdrawing, and ortho substituents. Given the prevalence
of heterocycles in pharmaceuticals, where amination reactions are
widely employed, we also tested several heterocyclic sulfamate substrates.
Both 2- and 3-substituted pyridines were well tolerated, as demonstrated
by the formation of products 10 and 11,
respectively. Moreover, indole-, isoquinoline-, and dihydrobenzofuran-containing
substrates were suitable coupling partners, as judged by the formation
of 12–14 in synthetically useful
yields.

Figure 2 Coupling of (hetero)aryl sulfamates with morpholine in 2-Me-THF.
Reactions were carried out with NiCl2(DME) (5–15
mol %), SIPr·HCl (10–30 mol %), Ph–B(pin) (0.30–0.45
equiv), substrate (0.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv), morpholine (1.80 equiv),
NaOtBu (2.25–2.55 equiv), hexamethylbenzene
(0.10 equiv), and solvent (used as received, 2.5 mL), for 3 h. Yields
were determined using hexamethylbenzene as an internal standard.

Similarly, an array of aryl chlorides underwent the nickel-catalyzed
amination reaction with morpholine (2) in 2-Me-THF (Figure 3). Nonheterocyclic substrates, including those containing
electronically or sterically biasing substituents, coupled smoothly,
as shown by the formation of adducts 4 and 6–9. Of note, commercially available heterocyclic
aryl chlorides could also be employed, thus giving rise to products 10, 11, 15, and 16.
The tolerance of the methodology to pyridines, quinolines, and benzothiophenes
suggests the utility of our coupling conditions for applications in
drug discovery.

Figure 3 Coupling of (hetero)aryl chlorides with morpholine in
2-Me-THF.
Reactions were carried out with NiCl2(DME) (5–15
mol %), SIPr·HCl (10–30 mol %), Ph–B(pin) (0.35–0.70
equiv), substrate (0.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv), morpholine (1.80 equiv),
NaOtBu (2.25–2.70 equiv), hexamethylbenzene
(0.10 equiv), and solvent (used as received, 2.5 mL), for 3 h. Yields
were determined using hexamethylbenzene as an internal standard.

As shown in Figure 4, the scope of this
amination methodology is not limited to the use of morpholine as the
amine coupling partner. For example, pyrrolidine could be employed
to give aminated product 17. As demonstrated by the formation
of 18, the acyclic amine n-methylbutylamine
was also tolerated in this methodology. Additionally, we found that
2,6-dimethylaniline, despite its steric hindrance, underwent
the desired amination to give the unsymmetrical biaryl amine product 19. We were also delighted to find that a piperazine nucleophile
bearing a pyridine ring coupled smoothly to give product 20 in 94% yield.

Figure 4 Scope of amine component in the coupling reaction. Reactions
were
carried out with NiCl2(DME) (5–15 mol %), SIPr·HCl
(10–30 mol %), Ph–B(pin) (0.35–0.75 equiv), substrate
(0.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv), morpholine (1.20–2.40 equiv), NaOtBu (2.10–3.45 equiv), hexamethylbenzene (0.10 equiv),
and solvent (used as received, 2.5 mL), for 3 h. Yields were determined
using hexamethylbenzene as an internal standard.

One general limitation pertaining to nickel-catalyzed
cross-couplings
is the frequent use of high catalyst loadings (i.e., often >10%).2d−2h Whereas progress has been made in rendering nickel-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura
couplings more efficient,4,6i corresponding achievements
in nickel-mediated amination reactions have been lacking. To address
this challenge, we tested the coupling of trifluoromethyl-containing
sulfamate and chloride substrates 21a and 21b, respectively, in the amination reaction with 2 using
2-Me-THF as the solvent (Figure 5). Using 3
and 1 mol % Ni, respectively, we found that gram-scale couplings could
be achieved to give the arylated morpholine product 7 in excellent yields.

Figure 5 Gram-scale couplings of trifluoromethyl-containing substrates.

As noted earlier, the amination
of heterocyclic substrates in 2-Me-THF
provides a promising tool for synthesizing pharmaceutical candidates.
To further probe this notion, we tested the gram-scale couplings of
heterocycle-containing substrates, as shown in Figure 6. Chloroquinoline 22 underwent facile coupling
with morpholine (2) to generate aminated product 15 in 94% yield. This coupling was performed on gram-scale
using 3 mol % Ni. Finally, we tested the gram-scale coupling of trifluoromethylated
aryl chloride 21b with pyridyl piperazine derivative 23. This reaction provided adduct 24 in 88% yield;
of note, 24 contains two heterocycles and a trifluoromethyl
group, all of which are motifs commonly seen in pharmaceuticals.

Figure 6 Gram-scale
couplings of heterocyclic substrates.

In summary, we have developed the nickel-catalyzed coupling
of
a variety of electrophilic substrates (e.g., halides and pseudohalides)
with amines using the attractive, green solvent 2-Me-THF. The couplings
of aryl O-sulfamates and aryl chlorides proceed in
the highest yields and may be achieved using an air-stable nickel
precatalyst. The methodology has a broad scope and is tolerant of
electronically biasing substituents, sterics, and even pharmaceutically
relevant heterocycles. The scalability of the nickel-catalyzed amination
in 2-Me-THF using low catalyst loading bodes well for future synthetic
applications in drug discovery and other arenas.

Aryl chlorides are attractive substrates
as they are often available commercially or are easily synthesized.
Additionally, aryl chlorides are often robust enough to be carried
through multiple synthetic operations.


Aryl sulfamates bear many notable features.
They are easily synthesized from their corresponding phenols, which
are often commercially available, and are generally stable to acidic
and basic reaction conditions. Moreover, aryl sulfamates may be used
to direct arene functionalization through electrophilic aromatic substitution
or ortho-lithiation processes. For a discussion of
these features, see:
