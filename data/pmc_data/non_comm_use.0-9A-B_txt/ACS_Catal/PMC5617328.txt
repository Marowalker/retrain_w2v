Pd(II)-catalyzed
C–H functionalization of nondirected arenes
has been realized using an inexpensive and easily accessible type
of bidentate S,O-ligand. The catalytic system shows high efficiency
in the C–H olefination reaction of electron-rich and electron-poor
arenes. This methodology is operationally simple, scalable, and can
be used in late-stage functionalization of complex molecules. The
broad applicability of this catalyst has been showcased in other transformations
such as Pd(II)-catalyzed C–H acetoxylation and allylation reactions.

==== Body
Over the past decade, metal-catalyzed
C–H functionalization has emerged as a powerful methodology
for the synthesis of valuable chemicals and materials.1 This approach brings the opportunity to introduce complexity
in organic molecules in a most efficient manner, since no prefunctionalization
of the starting materials is required. Many elegant and efficient
methodologies have been described for the direct functionalization
of C–H bonds, but the vast majority of these examples require
the presence of a directing group to enhance the reactivity and selectivity
of the process.2 Reports of direct C–H
functionalization of simple arenes, without a directing group, are
still scarce.3 An attractive alternative
to the use of directing groups is the development of suitable ligands
that may lead to the discovery of new catalytic systems capable of
promoting these transformations. However, to date, the arsenal of
ligands that enable metal-catalyzed C–H functionalization reactions
is very limited.4 The research in our group
aims at the development of novel ligands/catalytic systems capable
of promoting selective C–H functionalization reactions to broaden
the applicability of this strategy in organic synthesis. In this field,
groundbreaking developments by the groups of Yu,5 Sanford,6 Stahl,7 and Glorius8 have identified
pyridine-based ligands as very versatile and efficient ligands for
nondirected Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization reactions. In
the particular case of the Pd-catalyzed C–H olefination (the
Fujiwara–Moritani reaction) of simple arenes,9 Yu’s initial report shows good results with electron-poor
arenes using a bulky pyridine ligand.5 Subsequent
investigations on the topic from Sanford’s group describe the
beneficial effect of 3,5-dichloropyridine ligand as a promotor of
the Fujiwara–Moritani reaction for electron-rich and electron-poor
arenes.10

Recently, our group reported
an increase in reactivity and site
selectivity in the C–H acetoxylation of simple arenes in the
presence of picolinic acid ligands.11 We
postulate that the carboxylic acid functionality of the picolinic
acid ligand promotes the C–H bond cleavage via a concerted
metalation-deprotonation (CMD) mechanism.12 In addition, the chelating ability of the ligand enhances the stability
of the catalyst. However, the irreversible formation of an inactive
palladium complex bearing two picolinic acid molecules is a major
drawback for this system. We envisioned that a bidentate ligand with
weaker coordination ability to Pd(OAc)2 than the bidentate
picolinic acid ligand would lead to a more efficient catalyst. Thus,
we decided to investigate the performance of bidentate thioethercarboxylates,
which are easily accessible and have hemilabile behavior in palladium
chemistry.13 To the best of our knowledge,
this type of ligand has never been used in metal catalysis. Here,
we report the discovery of a new class of S,O-ligands, that enable
nondirected Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization reactions of
arenes. These S,O-ligands show higher activity and stronger influence
on the site selectivity than the well-established pyridine-based ligands
in the C–H olefination of simple arenes. The new methodology
is also successful in preparative scale and in late-stage functionalization
of complex molecules, a step that could not be taken with previously
described catalytic systems. Moreover, the new Pd/S,O-ligand catalyst
is also active in the C–H acetoxylation and allylation of benzene.

Thioethercarboxylic acid ligands can be easily made in gram scale
in two steps, starting from commercially available carboxylic acids.14,15 We started our investigations by studying the performance of these
thioethercarboxylic acid ligands in the Pd(II)-catalyzed C–H
olefination reaction employing benzene and ethyl acrylate as model
substrates under standard reaction conditions (see Table 1). The reaction, in the absence
of a ligand, provided, after 2 h, the alkenylated product 1 in only 16% yield. In contrast, the presence of 2-ethy-2-(phenylthio)acetic
acid (L1) resulted in an increase in yield, up to 64%.
Other thioethercarboxylic acid ligands with different side chains
of the thioetheracetic acid were studied. Similar yields were obtained
with ligands bearing aliphatic chains in α-position (L2 and L3), including the gem-dimethyl (L4) and cyclopropane (L5) ligands. The phenylthioetheracetic
acid (L6), 2-phenyl-2-(phenylthio)acetic acid (L7), and the 2-(phenylthio)benzoic acid (L8)
furnished the olefinated product 1 in lower yields (20%–40%)
than L1–L5. We next explored the
reactivity of the catalytic system regarding the substituents attached
to the sulfur atom. In particular, electron-rich, electron-poor, bulky
aromatic (L9–L14), and aliphatic
substituents (L15 and L16) were investigated.
Unfortunately, all these ligands provided similar or slightly lower
yields than those obtained with L1–L5, with the exception of the bulky ligand L10, with a triphenylmethyl group, which did not furnish any
product. The reaction with the tetrahydro-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid
(L17) and the 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (L18) provided the desired product, in 61% and 26% yield, respectively.
From these initial studies, we concluded that, in general, thioethercarboxylic
acid ligands bearing aliphatic substituents in α-position and
with a neutral aromatic ring attached to the sulfur atom constitute
the most active catalyst for the Pd-catalyzed C–H olefination
of benzene.

a Yields were determined
by 1H NMR analysis of the crude mixture, using CH2Br2 as internal standard.

The kinetic profile in Scheme 1 clearly indicates that 2-i-propyl-2-(phenylthio)acetic
acid (L2) increased the reaction rate dramatically. Having
established the positive effect of the S,O-ligand in the dehydrogenative
Heck reaction, different experiments were conducted to ascertain the
role of each functionality in the ligand (Table 1). First, we performed the reaction with
the corresponding sulfoxide (L19) and sulfone (L20) to confirm that these species are not responsible for
the observed catalytic activity. Indeed, the reaction in the presence
of either of these ligands proceeded with similar outcome as the reaction
carried out without any ligand. The use of thioanisole (L21) or methyl 2,2-dimethyl-2-(phenylthio)acetate (L22)
as ligands furnished the olefinated product 1 in 27%
and 37% yield, respectively. These results confirmed that the presence
of both functionalities, the thioether and the carboxylic acid, are
crucial for the acceleration of the reaction. Different conditions
for the oxidative Heck reaction were examined in the presence of L2 (see Tables S2–S5 in
the Supporting Information), but no improvement was observed, compared
to the standard conditions.

Heck Coupling of Benzene and
Ethyl Acrylate without Ligand and in the Presence of L2
With the optimized conditions
in hand, we set out to explore the
substrate scope of this transformation with different substituted
arenes (see Table 2).16 All the reactions were performed
in a pressure tube using 5 mol % of catalyst and stirring at
100 °C for 6 h. At this time, the formation of Pd black was observed
in most cases. The reaction of arenes with alkyl substituents such
as ortho- and meta-xylene and mesitylene
provided the alkenylated products 2, 3,
and 4 with excellent yields (76%, 83%, and 84%, respectively).
Regarding the selectivity, the ortho-xylene provided
a 1:1.9 ratio of the α(a) and β(b) isomers, respectively,
and the meta-xylene provided a mixture of isomers
(a:b:c = 4.9:1:1.3 ratio) in favor of the less sterically ortho olefinated product. In a similar manner, 76% yield
was obtained in the reaction using naphthalene as starting material
with a ratio of 2:1 in favor of the α-olefinated product 5. We also tested the reaction of arenes bearing strong electron-donating
groups. Excellent yields were obtained employing anisole, 1,2- and
1,3-dimethoxybenzene, and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as starting materials
(70%–81%). Anisole provided a 1.5:1 ratio of the ortho and para isomers, respectively, and only traces
of the meta isomer were detected. 1,2-Dimethoxybenzene
yielded a 1:4.9 ratio of the corresponding α(a) and β(b)
isomers. Similarly, the C–H olefination of 1,3-dimethoxybenzene
occurred mainly at the least sterically hindered C–H bond at
the ortho position of the methoxy group (6:1 ratio).
The C–H olefination of electron-poor arenes was also explored.
The reaction with ethyl benzoate provided the desired olefinated products 10 in 42% yield, as a mixture of isomers in favor of the meta olefinated product (o:m:p = 1.2:3.3:1). When 1,2- 1,3-, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene
were employed as starting materials, the desired products were obtained
as a mixture of regioisomers in good yields (60%–74%). The
reaction with 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene furnished the desired product 14 in 77% yield. When 4-chloroanisole was subjected to standard
reaction conditions, the olefinated product 15 was obtained
in 60% yield in 4.3:1 ratio in favor of the ortho product, with respect to the methoxy substituent. Moreover, the
direct C–H olefination of unprotected phenol provided the ortho- and para-olefinated product 16 in excellent yield (82%) and in a ratio of 1.9:1, respectively.
Taking into consideration that only a few reports have addressed the
direct functionalization of phenols, both the yield obtained and the
preference for the ortho olefination are remarkable.17 In all cases, we observed much higher yields
using L2, in comparison with those in which the ligand
was absent (see Table S6 in the Supporting
Information). Finally, the C–H olefination in preparative scale,
using mesitylene and 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene as starting materials,
afforded the corresponding olefinated products 4 and 14 with good yields without any significant erosion from the
original values.

a The reaction
was stirred overnight.

Regarding
the site selectivity of the reaction, our results indicate
that it is mainly dictated by the substrate and controlled by electronic
factors, with preferential functionalization at the most electronic-rich
position in the arene. However, when we compare the site selectivity
of the reaction with and without L2, it is evident the
influence of L2 on the site selectivity (see Table S6 in the Supporting Information). In Table 3, we show some substrates
where a different trend in site selectivity in the presence of L2 was observed in comparison with the reaction without ligand.
The reaction of naphthalene in the absence of ligand provided a 1:1
ratio of isomers versus the 2:1 ratio obtained in the presence of L2 in favor of the α-olefinated product. The reactions
of anisole or phenol without ligand provided a mixture of ortho and para products, with a clear preference
for the former. In contrast, in the presence of L2, the ortho-olefinated products were preferred. On the other hand,
a similar trend in the site selectivity of the reaction of naphthalene
and anisole was observed without ligand and with 3,5-dichloropyridine,
which was the best ligand reported by Sanford for the C–H olefination
of simple arenes.10 The reaction of phenol
using 3,5-dichloropyridine provided a mixture of ortho and para products in 50% NMR yield with a small
preference for the ortho product (1.4o:1p). These results indicate that the S,O-ligand
has stronger influence on the site selectivity of the C–H olefination
reaction than the pyridine-based ligand.

Next, we explored the olefin scope.
The reaction with methyl acrylate
and ethyl cinnamate furnished the olefinated products 17 and 18, respectively, in high yields. Other electrophilic
alkenes such as vinyl phosphonates, vinyl amides, vinyl nitriles,
and vinyl sulfonates reacted efficiently with benzene, leading to
the olefinated products 19–22 in
good yields (42%–78%). Unfortunately, we did not observe any
improvement in the yield using nonactivated alkenes such as styrene
when using L2, in comparison with the reaction without
ligand.

Having revealed the high reactivity of the new catalytic
system
in simple arenes, we assessed the suitability of this methodology
for late-stage functionalization of complex molecules (see Scheme 2). To the best of
our knowledge, the intermolecular Fujiwara–Moritani reaction
of arenes without directing groups has not been applied in late-stage
functionalization. The reaction of O-methylestrone
(1 equiv) with ethyl acrylate (1.5 equiv) and 10 mol % of Pd(OAc)2 provided the desired product 23 in only 10%
conversion. In contrast, when the reaction was performed in the presence
of L2, the olefinated product 23 was obtained
in 88% yield as a mixture of ortho-olefinated isomers,
with respect to the methoxy substituents (a:b = 3:1). Moreover, we
compared our catalytic system with the one previously reported by
Sanford for the C–H olefination of simple arenes using 3,5-dichloropyridine
as a ligand.10 Under the same reaction
conditions, only 30% conversion was obtained. Similarly, when the
reaction of the naproxen derivative was carried out in the absence
of a ligand, only traces of olefinated product 24 were
detected by 1H NMR. The same reaction in the presence of L2 furnished a mixture of products with a combined isolated
yield of 88%, being the main isomer the ortho-olefinated
product, with respect to the methoxy substituent (a:other isomers
= 3:1). Again, for comparison, we performed the reaction of the naproxen
derivative using 3,5-dichloropyridine as ligand. Under the standard
conditions, we obtained a mixture of olefinated products in 27% NMR
yield. To further prove the applicability of the new catalytic system,
the C–H olefination in preparative scale of O-methylestrone (1.75 mmol) was performed. To our delight, yield comparable
to that of the original value was found.

Scheme 2 Late-Stage C–H
Olefination of (a) Estrone and (b) Naproxen
Derivatives
In search for a general
and efficient catalytic system capable
of promoting a large number of C–H functionalization reactions,
we decided to test L2 in C–H acetoxylation and
allylation reactions (see Scheme 3). The C–H acetoxylation reaction was performed
using benzene as the substrate and PhI(OAc)2 as the oxidant.
Under the standard reaction conditions, the presence of L2 significantly increased the reaction rate of the process. A 64%
yield was reached, compared to the 15% obtained in the absence of
the ligand (Scheme 3a). We monitored the reaction over time with L2 and
without ligand. Also, the reaction in the presence of pyridine was
performed for comparison.6a The kinetic
profile of these reactions indicates that the presence of L2 dramatically accelerated the reaction. Moreover, the S,O-ligand
showed higher activity than the pyridine ligand. In addition, the
C–H allylation reaction using benzene and allylbenzene as substrates
was also conducted with and without L2.18 Again, we observed an acceleration of the reaction rate
in the presence of the S,O-ligand L2 and the corresponding
allylated product was obtained in 54% yield (Scheme 3b). In this case, no acceleration using pyridine
as ligand was observed.

Scheme 3 S,O-Ligand-Promoted Pd-Catalyzed (a) C–H
Acetoxylation and
(b) Allylation of Benzene
The precise role of the S,O-ligand in the C–H olefination,
acetoxylation, and allylation reactions remains under investigation.19 However, considering that the C–H activation
of the inert C–H bond of the arene is common in all these transformation,
it seems reasonable to propose that the S,O-ligand is assisting the
C–H bond cleavage.

In summary, we have found a new catalytic
system based on Pd(OAc)2 and easily accessible S,O-ligands
that enables nondirected
C–H functionalization reactions of arenes. The catalyst promotes
the C–H olefination reaction of both electron-rich and electron-poor
arenes in high yields. Remarkably, the Pd/S,O-ligand system shows
higher activity and influence in the site selectivity than the well-established
Pd/pyridine-based catalytic system. The catalytic power of the new
methodology is convincingly demonstrated in late-stage functionalization
of complex molecules. Furthermore, the new catalyst is also active
in the C–H acetoxylation and allylation reaction of benzene.
We expect this new class of ligands to find broad application in C–H
functionalization reactions.

in one step from commercial available 2-bromo-3-methylbutanoic acid
in 73% isolated yield. See the Supporting Information.


We also tested the reaction
of other arenes
in the presence of L4 (NMR yields): naphthalene, 89%
(2.2a:1b); mesitylene, 93%; and 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene, 62%. The yields
obtained are similar or lower than those provided using L2 as ligand.

In our preliminary investigations
on the
mechanism of this transformation, we have isolated and fully characterized
by X-ray analysis the palladium complex bearing two molecules of L4 attached (CCDC 1567101 contains the supplementary crystallographic
data for Pd[OCOC(SPh)Me2]2). The model reaction
using this complex as catalyst furnished the olefinated product 1 in a similar yield (22% NMR yield) to that obtained with
Pd(OAc)2 (Table 1, entry 1), suggesting
that this complex is not involved in our catalytic system.
