Alumina-supported
Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for
light alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst loses activity during
reaction, with coke formation often considered as the reason for deactivation.
As we show in this study, the amount and nature of carbon deposits
do not directly correlate with the loss of activity. Rather, it is
the transformation of subnanometer Pt species into larger Pt nanoparticles
that appears to be responsible for the loss of catalytic activity.
Surprisingly, a portion of the Sn remains atomically dispersed on
the alumina surface in the spent catalyst and helps in the redispersion
of the Pt. In the absence of Sn on the alumina support, the larger
Pt nanoparticles formed during reaction are not redispersed during
oxidative regeneration. It is known that Sn is added as a promoter
in the industrial catalyst to help in achieving high propene selectivity
and to minimize coke formation. This work shows that an important
role of Sn is to help in the regeneration of Pt, by providing nucleation
sites on the alumina surface. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission
electron microscopy helps to provide unique insights into the operating
characteristics of an industrially important catalyst by demonstrating
the role of promoter elements, such as Sn, in the oxidative regeneration
of Pt on γ-Al2O3.

1 Introduction
There is an ever-increasing
demand for light alkenes,
including propene, because propene
is a very important chemical intermediate used for the production
of a wide variety of bulk chemicals and materials, including polymers.1,2 The primary route for the manufacture of propene is the selective
dehydrogenation of propane,3−10 a paraffin that can be obtained from low-cost feedstocks, such as
shale gas deposits, which are now becoming available.11,12 Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) occurs at high temperatures using
supported CrOx13−15 or Pt catalysts.
The drawback to light paraffin dehydrogenation processes is coking,
which deactivates the catalyst and reduces the selectivity toward
olefins. Sintering of the metal phase under high-temperature conditions
is another very important factor for deactivation of the catalysts,
and extensive studies have been conducted to determine factors that
can stabilize and inhibit sintering of the metal phase. For example,
in an alumina-supported Pt catalyst treated under high-temperature
oxidizing conditions, scanning transmission electron microscopy/transmission
electron microscopy (STEM/TEM) imaging,27Al magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), extended
X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations were used to show that atomic or subnanometer Pt
species could be stabilized and become sinter resistant because of
their strong interactions with the pentacoordinated Al3+ sites on the γ-Al2O3(100) surface.16,17 Typically, a second metal component, such as Sn14,18−24 and Ga,2,25−28 is added to the catalyst formulation,
which forms an alloy with Pt under reaction conditions, increasing
conversion and propene selectivity, inhibiting metal sintering, and
suppressing coke formation. Recently, more earth abundant metals,
such as Cu, have been used as promoters to form an alloy with Pt with
similar effects, such as inhibiting propene adsorption and suppressing
side reactions, increasing propene selectivity and yield, and reducing
the level of coke formation.29 To remove
the coke, catalysts are regenerated under oxidizing (or oxychlorination)
conditions followed by H2 reduction to reactivate the catalysts.
Such continuous treatments, however, may not fully restore catalytic
performance, leading to eventual loss of activity and selectivity
in consecutive cycles.19,30 Therefore, a better understanding
of the deactivation and regeneration processes is essential for the
design of improved light alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Alumina-supported
Pt–Sn catalysts have been extensively
used for light alkane dehydrogenation;14,19−24 recently, they have been used for jet fuel and hydrocarbon blend
partial dehydrogenation.31−35 The addition of Sn as a promoter helps to modify both the Pt active
phase and the support. Because the Pt–alkene interaction is
stronger than the Pt–alkane interaction, undesired side reactions
such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization can occur; Sn weakens the
Pt–alkene interaction without weakening the Pt–alkane
interaction and, therefore, suppresses the side reactions.14 This is how Sn is thought to influence the selectivity
of the catalyst. The Sn also helps to minimize sintering of the Pt
metal phase, inhibit the acidity of the support, and facilitate the
diffusion of coke species from Pt to the support. Aside from the beneficial
properties of the Sn promoter, there is an ongoing debate about the
electronic36,37 and geometric38 effects of adding Sn to Pt in order to explain the reaction
mechanism through which Sn influences the catalytic performance of
light alkane dehydrogenation.

In this work, we describe another
important role of Sn in these
catalysts. We found that the initial activity of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 could be regenerated over multiple cycles after
this catalyst had been deactivated during PDH. Such regeneration was
only possible after the first cycle for Pt/γ-Al2O3, with the catalyst progressively losing its activity in subsequent
cycles as larger Pt nanoparticles were formed. We conclude that a
critical difference between the monometallic and bimetallic Pt-based
alkane dehydrogenation catalysts is in the regeneration step, wherein
Sn provides nucleation sites to redisperse Pt and/or re-form subnanometer
Pt clusters in the Pt–Sn catalyst. The coke content of the
catalyst material in each cycle was examined to see if the loss of
activity was related to the amount of carbon deposited. The results
show that the extent of deactivation of Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 could not be
correlated with coke deposits, as is commonly assumed in the literature.22,24,30,39,40 This is because the coke can be effectively
transported to the support, as suggested previously,19,29,41,42 allowing the active sites to continue functioning.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
Two catalyst
materials, 0.5 wt % Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 0.5
wt % Pt–1.5 wt % Sn/γ-Al2O3, were
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a solution containing
H2PtCl6(H2O)x (38 wt % Pt, Sigma-Aldrich) with or without SnCl2(H2O)2 (98%, VWR Int.) onto a puralox alumina
support (SASOL, γ-Al2O3). The catalysts
were dried for 2 h at 60 °C and overnight at 120 °C, followed
by calcination at 560 °C for 3 h.

2.2 Catalyst
Characterization
The catalysts
were dispersed in ethanol and mounted on holey carbon grids for examination
in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode using two electron microscopes.
One was a JEOL 2010F 200 kV transmission electron microscope (resolution
of 0.14 nm) equipped with an Oxford Energy dispersive spectroscopy
system for elemental analysis. The other was a JEOL JEM ARMS200CF
200 kV aberration-corrected (AC) transmission electron microscope
(resolution of 0.08 nm) also equipped with an Oxford Energy dispersive
spectroscopy system but with a wide area detector for atomic-resolution
elemental analysis. The AC microscope was used to determine if single
atoms were present in the spent catalysts. For each sample, several
STEM images were used to count Pt or PtSn particle sizes, with 10–60
particles measured per image. The particle size distribution was presented
in a histogram, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated
from the total number of particles counted (∼700–800)
in each sample. To analyze the carbon deposits in the spent catalysts
after the 1st and 10th PDH cycles, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer 1 Analyzer. The catalyst
(10–25 mg) was dried under Ar at 150 °C and then heated
in O2 from room temperature to 900 °C (rate of 10
°C min–1). Operando Raman spectroscopy has
been described elsewhere.43

2.3 Catalyst Testing
A tubular quartz
reactor was filled with 0.3 g of catalyst and placed inside an oven.
The catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 600 °C for
1 h to obtain the catalytically active metallic Pt phase, after which
pure propane at a rate of 9 mL min–1 flowed through
the catalyst bed (WHSV = 3.2 h–1) and dehydrogenation
reaction was performed for 6 h. After the reaction (1st cycle), the
deactivated catalyst was regenerated by passing a mixture of O2 and He over the catalyst at 600 °C for 1 h followed
by a 45 min H2 reduction step, and the next PDH reaction
was performed for 6 h (2nd cycle) for a total of 10 dehydrogenation–regeneration
cycles. The products were collected at 5 min intervals using a gas
chromatograph (GC) equipped with FID (Porabond-Q column) and TCD (Carboxan
column) detectors.

3 Results
Catalytic
testing of the Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts during prolonged
PDH reactions (at 600 °C and 1 bar) consisted of 10 dehydrogenation–regeneration
cycles. Propane conversion and selectivity toward propene are shown
in Figure 1, with the
data at different periods of time during the cycles summarized in Table 1. Both catalyst materials
initially show similar high propane conversions (35.0 vs 35.6%); however,
Pt/γ-Al2O3 deactivates rapidly, whereas
the conversion remains high and stable for Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 during the first PDH cycle. After the third cycle,
the Pt catalyst displays the lowest propane conversion (i.e., 17.1%).
The Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows significant
deactivation beginning with the second cycle, with an increasing level
of deactivation through the fifth cycle, after which there is a similar
activity profile in the subsequent cycles. At the end of the 10th
cycle, propane conversion for Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 (14.1%) is similar to the conversion for Pt/γ-Al2O3 (12.9%), but the major difference is the ease with
which the reactivity of the Sn-containing catalyst is restored after
each regeneration step. Sn also plays a significant role in influencing
the selectivity, with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 showing
selectivity toward propene (88.5%) significantly higher than that
of Pt/γ-Al2O3 even in its fresh state
(72.1%).

flowing O2/He at 600 °C followed by H2 reduction
at 600 °C, for a total of 10 dehydrogenation–regeneration
cycles.

TGA was used to quantify the amount
of coke present on the spent
catalysts by combusting the carbon deposits under flowing O2, and the resultant loss of weight was measured as a function of
temperature. The amount of coke present on the spent catalysts after
1 and 10 PDH cycles is summarized in Table 2, and the plot of the weight loss of carbon
as a function of temperature is shown in Figure 2. After the first cycle, coke combustion
occurs at a much lower temperature for Pt/γ-Al2O3 than for Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3, suggesting
that carbon deposits are in the proximity of the Pt sites in the Pt
catalyst, whereas for the Pt-Sn catalyst, carbon deposits are likely
located on the alumina support because combustion occurs at a higher
temperature.22 After the 10th cycle, coke
combustion temperatures have changed for both catalysts, and the combustion
profiles are now similar. In a previous study of olefin metathesis
catalysts, we demonstrated by EFTEM how the coke can be present on
the alumina support and not block the active sites.44

PDH cycles.

At the end of the first
reaction cycle, more coke is deposited
on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 (10.5 wt %) than on Pt/γ-Al2O3 (6.2 wt %), but after the 10th cycle, less coke
is deposited on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 (5 wt %);
there is no real change in the amount of coke deposited on Pt/γ-Al2O3 (6.4 wt %). Via examination of the dehydrogenation–regeneration
cycles as shown in Figure 1 and the amount of carbon deposits as summarized in Table 2, there is no obvious
correlation between the amount of coke on the spent catalysts and
the final catalytic activity. After the first cycle, Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 has almost twice the amount of carbon as in
Pt/γ-Al2O3, but Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 does not deactivate while Pt/γ-Al2O3 deactivates rapidly. After the 10th cycle, both samples
show similar amounts of carbon, but Pt/γ-Al2O3 has been significantly deactivated compared to Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3. This suggests that deactivation for all dehydrogenation–regeneration
cycles is not due to blocking of the metal active sites by coke. Operando
Raman spectra (Figure S1) are similar for
all cycles (1st, 3rd, and 10th) in the spent Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 samples
(D1/G ratio ∼
0.72), indicating a similar nature of carbon deposits in both samples.
HRTEM of the spent Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
after the 10th cycle, as shown in Figure 3, does not show any carbon deposits on the
metal surfaces, only on the surface of alumina. Previously, we demonstrated
that 10 wt % carbon, forming close to a monolayer on the silica support,
could be imaged via HRTEM.45 We see a very
similar morphology in deactivated Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 containing 5 wt % carbon, which is close to a monolayer (Figure 3). The HRTEM image
shows a wormy surface layer on the spent catalyst, corresponding to
the 3.4 Å interlayer spacing of graphite, which is absent after
the catalyst has been treated under oxidizing conditions. We therefore
conclude that the coke in this sample is located on the alumina support
and does not block active sites, and therefore, deactivation may not
be correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposits.26 The results are also in agreement with the work
of Sokolov et al.,30 in which they found
that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst showed the
highest carbon deposit after four oxidative regeneration cycles with
Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 showing the smallest carbon
deposit, yet VOx/MCM-41 was the most active
and stable catalyst for PDH.

of carbon deposits on the surface of alumina, whereas the blue arrows
in panels c and d indicate the removal of carbon from the surface
of alumina after oxidative regeneration.

image with particle size distributions shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

HAADF-STEM images of Pt/γ-Al2O3 before
and after PDH, and their corresponding particle size distributions,
are shown in Figure 4. The catalyst initially contains highly dispersed, very small metallic
Pt nanoparticles [d̅ = 0.6 ± 0.2 nm (Figure 4b)] in the absence
of large Pt nanoparticles observed at lower magnifications (Figure 4a). After 10 PDH
cycles, Pt has sintered into larger nanoparticles [d̅ = 5.9 ± 2.0 nm (Figure 4c,d)] with very few of the smaller <1 nm Pt particles remaining
after reaction. The complete particle size distribution (PSD) is shown
in Figure S2.

and d) (see Figure S3 for the complete
particle size distribution). AC-STEM images after 10 PDH cycles (e

The measured d spacing in panel f is indexed to Pt3Sn.

In the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (Figure 5), we also see highly
dispersed, very small metallic nanoparticles in the fresh catalyst
[d̅ = 0.8 ± 0.2 nm (Figure 5b)] in the absence of large Pt-Sn particles
(Figure 5a). After
three PDH cycles, some of the Pt-Sn particles have sintered (Figure S3a) while the majority have remained
small and dispersed after reaction [d̅ = 1.2
± 0.3 nm (Figure S3b)]. After 10 PDH
cycles, Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 reveals a bimodal
distribution that is best shown in images at different magnifications; Figure 5c shows the large
particle average to be d̅ = 10 nm, while Figure 5d shows the small
particle average to be d̅ = 1.2 nm. The complete
size distribution is shown in Figure S3c. The aberration-corrected (AC)-STEM images also show isolated single-atom
species on this spent catalyst (Figure 5e) and small clusters of the Pt3Sn phase
(Figure 5f). EDS analysis
(Figure 6) suggests
that the atomically dispersed species are composed of Sn, because
we can detect Sn in this sample even in regions devoid of any metallic
nanoparticles. These atomically dispersed species represent Sn atoms
strongly bound to the alumina support that are stable even after extended
reactions at elevated temperatures.

of the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after 10
PDH cycles. Only Sn is present
on the alumina support in regions where there are no obvious metallic
particles.

Figure 7 AC-STEM images of the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after the 10th PDH cycle subjected to an oxidative
regeneration
treatment. The >10 nm particles in this oxidatively treated catalyst
can be indexed to the Pt3Sn phase and are difficult to
redisperse (a and b) under our conditions (600 °C in O2/He). On the other hand, smaller Pt-Sn particles are easier to subject
to attrition (see Figure 10), leaving behind atomically dispersed species and subnanometer-sized
clusters (c and d). Irregularly shaped SnO2 particles (d)
remain because the Pt has migrated away [d spacing
indexed to SnO2 (101)].

The Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 spent catalyst
after
the 10th cycle was subjected to one additional oxidative treatment
at 600 °C in flowing O2/He for 1 h, followed by H2 reduction for 45 min, to study regeneration of the catalyst.
The particle size distribution remained bimodal (Figure S4), with larger particles such as those shown in panels
a and b of Figure 7, and highly dispersed species shown in panels c and d of Figure 7. The larger particles
shown in panels a and b show lattice fringes having d spacings of 0.14 and 0.23 nm, which can be indexed to the Pt3Sn (220) and (111) lattice planes, respectively. These particles
are larger than 10 nm in size and have apparently remained intact
without undergoing any change during the oxidative regeneration step. Figure 7c shows an image
of another region of this same catalyst showing the existence of subnanometer
Pt clusters. The size of the clusters is very similar to those seen
in the fresh catalyst. EDS analysis (Figures 8 and 9) allows determination
of Pt and Sn compositions in these subnanometer clusters for the fresh
and regenerated Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.
There are some clusters in the regenerated catalyst that are 100%
Pt; however, the majority of these particles are subnanometer Pt-Sn
bimetallic clusters. While it is possible for EDS analysis to pick
up X-rays from the surrounding support (which contains atomically
dispersed Sn), we rule this out because we are able to find regions
devoid of Sn. This indicates that the tightly collimated beam in the
STEM provides EDS analysis exclusively from regions where the beam
is focused (as shown in the boxes in Figure 9).

subnanometer clusters

measured by EDS analysis.

detected due to Pt redispersion.

4 Discussion
It is well-known from the continuous
catalyst regeneration (CCR)
step in the UOP Oleflex dehydrogenation process that coke combustion
and Pt redispersion occur via treatment of the catalyst in a chlorine/air
mixture.1,46 In this work, our catalysts are treated
with O2 and in the absence of a halide. From the AC-STEM
images and bimodal particle size distribution shown in Figure 7 and Figure S4, respectively, it appears that >10 nm Pt3Sn
particles
cannot be easily redispersed because treatment under oxidizing conditions
is not aggressive enough for complete Pt redispersion in the absence
of a halide. Nonetheless, we redisperse a portion of the Pt-Sn particles
to subnanometer Pt species during the oxidative regeneration step,
and the presence of the redispersed subnanometer Pt species helps
explain the regeneration in catalyst activity that is seen after each
cycle in Figure 1.
The image in Figure 7d also shows isolated single atoms, which were seen also in the initial
Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst material in panels
e and f of Figure 5. These single atoms represent oxidized Sn strongly bound to the
alumina support, which survive multiple cycles of PDH followed by
oxidative regeneration. Additional HAADF-STEM images are presented
in Figure 10 showing various stages of the oxidative regeneration
process. We see attrition of the smaller Pt-Sn nanoparticles, which
leave behind SnO2 in the form of irregular shaped particles
or “tails”. These “tails” represent wetting
of the alumina support by SnO2. Such particles were not
seen in the monometallic Pt catalyst after the same oxidative regeneration
step (Figure S5). Therefore, we postulate
that the process of oxidative redispersion does not occur on the monometallic
Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This is because atomically
dispersed Sn oxide is not present on the monometallic catalyst. These
atomically dispersed Sn species help provide nucleation sites to form
subnanometer Pt clusters during oxidative regeneration. During the
initial catalyst preparation, the highly hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 appears to provide plenty of nucleation sites,
but subsequent high-temperature reaction and regeneration steps lead
to a loss of these nucleation sites on the alumina support. For this
reason, the monometallic Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
does not undergo regeneration (Figure 11a,b). In the bimetallic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, Sn remains anchored to the alumina,
providing the atomically dispersed sites needed for the regeneration
of the catalyst, leading to facile Pt redispersion (Figure 11c,d).

Figure 10 HAADF-STEM images of
the spent Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after
oxidative regeneration, which show attrition
of larger Pt-Sn particles into smaller particles (a and b) and particles
with “tails” (c and d), as shown by red arrows. These
“tails” represent wetting of the alumina support by
SnO2.

Figure 11 AC-STEM images of the
Pt/γ-Al2O3 (a
and b) and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 (c and d) catalysts
after 10 PDH cycles. No single atoms are present in Pt/γ-Al2O3, but isolated single atoms are abundant on the
bimetallic catalyst. These single atoms are needed to regenerate the
catalyst by redispersion of Pt, as in the case of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3.

The tell-tale signs of oxidative regeneration, attrition
of large
Pt-Sn particles or the presence of particles with “tails”,
are absent on the monometallic catalyst (Figure 10). We attribute this difference to a lack
of suitable nucleation sites on the alumina support (Figure 11). Subnanometer Pt clusters
in the fresh Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are irreversibly
lost after successive reaction and regeneration cycles (Figure 4), leading to significant loss
of activity and propene selectivity over the 10 cycles in our study
(Figure 1 and Table 1). In contrast, the
bimetallic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst continues
to be regenerated after each cycle, with only minor losses of activity
and selectivity. The AC-STEM images in Figures 5 and 7 therefore demonstrate
an important role played by Sn in addition to its role as a promoter
in enhancing propene selectivity and in suppressing coke formation.
Atomically dispersed Sn is present on alumina even after multiple
reaction cycles involving oxidative regeneration, providing the needed
nucleation sites for Pt to be redispersed and re-creating subnanometer
Pt–Sn clusters. The similarity in particle size distribution
for Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts in the fresh catalyst material confirms
the role of the highly dispersed species in this reaction. We therefore
infer that the loss of activity of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 is primarily due to the sintering of the alloyed Pt-Sn species,
which are partially restored during oxidative regeneration. The presence
of a bimodal particle size distribution suggests that some of the
activity is lost due to the formation of larger metallic particles.

The temperature at which oxidative regeneration is performed may
play an important role in the Pt redispersion and, hence, catalytic
activity of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3. In a previous
study of Pt-Ga/Al2O3 catalysts, we treated these
catalysts at different temperatures, after which Pt dispersion was
measured by CO chemisorption.2 When the
catalyst was treated in O2 and He at 550 °C, we observed
good Pt dispersion (∼25%), but when the catalyst was treated
in O2 and He at 650 °C, there was a significant decrease
in the level of Pt dispersion (∼10%). We suspect there may
be a similar trend in which there is a critical oxidative regeneration
temperature between 550 and 650 °C for Pt to redisperse as subnanometer
species in the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
In this work, the oxidative regeneration temperature of 600 °C
may be critical for the regeneration of Pt-Sn and other bimetallic
catalysts for PDH.

A previous high-energy resolution X-ray absorption
study (HERFD
XANES) of Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 supports this model of catalyst regeneration.19 During oxidative regeneration, the Sn in the
sintered Pt-Sn alloy was oxidized and likely segregated from the alloy
as SnO2 particles. Pt dispersion was restored after subsequent
H2 reduction, leading to formation of new Pt-Sn alloy clusters.
While HERFD XANES provides averaged information, the spatially resolved
information via AC-STEM in this study helps in the assembly of a more
complete picture of the oxidative regeneration process of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

Because of the high current
density in the AC-STEM probe, atoms
could be ejected from a metallic nanoparticle and redeposit in the
vicinity on the support. However, the electron beam current used in
this study did not cause such artifacts; otherwise, we would have
observed Pt atoms in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
Panels a and b of Figure 11 clearly show that no dispersed Pt atoms are present in the
Pt/γ-Al2O3 sample in the vicinity of the
nanoparticles. The isolated atoms that are seen in the spent Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 sample (Figure 11c,d) are Sn atoms bound strongly to the alumina support,
and they are also present in the fresh Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 sample (Figure S6). Once
again, Sn is detected by EDS (Figure 6) and via AC-STEM (Figure S6) in regions without any obvious metallic particles; hence, it cannot
be due to an electron beam artifact. The presence of such dispersed
Sn was also implied in previous work using HERFD-XANES spectroscopy;
AC-STEM provides direct visual confirmation of the presence of dispersed
Sn in this sample.

5 Conclusions
The
addition of Sn to Pt/γ-Al2O3 increases
propene selectivity, and Sn provides the necessary nucleation sites
to redisperse Pt atoms and to re-create, at least partially, subnanometer
Pt clusters in the spent catalyst after oxidative regeneration. The
critical difference between the monometallic Pt/γ-Al2O3 and the bimetallic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts lies in the ability to re-form the catalytically
active highly dispersed Pt species. This study shows that while coke
formation occurs on both catalysts, the amount of coke does not correlate
with the observed (loss in) reactivity. We further see that larger
(∼10 nm) Pt3Sn particles in spent Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 show low propane dehydrogenation activity in
this reaction. The presence of stable, atomically dispersed Sn species
is an important finding and could lead to the better design of regenerable
catalysts for a wide variety of applications. Other promoters, such
as Ga, may play a similar role2 and will
be the subject of future study.
