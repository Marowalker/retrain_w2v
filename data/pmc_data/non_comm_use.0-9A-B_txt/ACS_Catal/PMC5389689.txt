Fe/ZSM-5 nanosheet
zeolites of varying thickness were synthesized
with di- and tetraquaternary ammonium structure directing agents and
extensively characterized for their textural, structural, and catalytic
properties. Introduction of Fe3+ ions in the framework
of nanosheet zeolites was slightly less effective than in bulk ZSM-5
zeolite. Steaming was necessary to activate all catalysts for N2O decomposition and benzene oxidation. The higher the Fe content,
the higher the degree of Fe aggregation was after catalyst activation.
The degree of Fe aggregation was lower when the crystal domain size
of the zeolite or the Fe content was decreased. These two parameters
had a substantial influence on the catalytic performance. Decreasing
the number of Fe sites along the b-direction strongly
suppressed secondary reactions of phenol and, accordingly, catalyst
deactivation. This together with the absence of diffusional limitations
in nanosheet zeolites explains the much higher phenol productivity
obtainable with nanostructured Fe/ZSM-5. Steamed Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite
nanosheet synthesized using C22-6-3·Br2 (domain size in b-direction ∼3 nm)
and containing 0.24 wt % Fe exhibited the highest catalytic performance.
During the first 24 h on stream, this catalyst produced 185 mmolphenol g–1. Calcination to remove the coke
deposits completely restored the initial activity.

==== Body
Introduction
Phenol is an important industrial precursor
for the production
of various polymers such as nylon and phenolic resins, drugs, herbicides,
and detergents.1 In industrial practice,
phenol is obtained from benzene via the three-step cumene process.
This process is environmentally stressing, and its economics are disadvantaged
by the coproduction of equimolar amounts of acetone.2,3 Substantial efforts have been made to develop more attractive one-step
routes for phenol manufacture.2−7 Panov and co-workers found that Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyzes the oxidation
of benzene to phenol using nitrous oxide as oxidant.6,8−10 N2O can for instance be obtained from
waste streams in nitric acid and adipic acid plants.11 Although not commercialized, this approach constitutes
an interesting alternative to the cumene process.

The mechanism
of the benzene oxidation to phenol reaction with
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts involves two steps:10 1   2  N2O decomposition proceeds
on active
iron centers (“α-sites”) to form a surface oxygen
species that is often called “α-oxygen”; “α-oxygen”
is able to oxidize benzene to phenol. Although the exact structure
of the “α-sites” in Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites for N2O decomposition and oxidation of benzene to phenol remains
unclear, most studies agree that on the role of cationic extraframework
Fe complexes in Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites.9,12−17 It has been found that only a fraction of these “α-oxygen”
are able to oxidize benzene to phenol.5,15 Steaming of
isomorphously substituted Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite is crucial to enhance the
number of extraframework Fe ions.9,18 During steaming,
Fe–O–Si bonds in Fe/ZSM-5 crystals are broken, resulting
in the migration of Fe from the zeolite framework to extraframework
locations. In this process, a range of extraframework Fe species are
usually formed including isolated Fe cations, oligomeric cationic
Fe complexes, and neutral Fe-oxide clusters (FexOy) as well as larger Fe-oxide
aggregates. Bulk Fe-oxides species display very low activity in the
decomposition of N2O.16 There
are strong indications that isolated Fe2+ sites are involved
in the unusual oxidation chemistry of Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites.1 A recent DFT study by Li et al. confirmed that
“α-oxygen” obtained by N2O decomposition
on isolated ferrous (Fe2+) species can catalyze the oxidation
of benzene to phenol. When “α-oxygen” atoms are
generated on isolated or oligomeric ferric (Fe3+) oxide
clusters, the oxidation of benzene to phenol results in formation
of a phenolate intermediate, which is strongly adsorbed on the Fe
sites and causes deactivation. This may explain why not all “α-oxygen”
is active in benzene oxidation. The strongly adsorbed phenolate intermediate
has also been considered as a precursor of coke, contributing to pore
plugging.19 These ideas are in keeping
with earlier findings of Sachtler and co-workers.5 Another side-reaction involves the oxidation of phenol
into dihydroxybenzenes and their condensation into high-molecular
weight aromatic compounds, which slowly migrate through the micropores
and may also deposit there.20 Brønsted
acid sites in zeolite channels are believed to be another cause of
coke formation in these Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites.5,20−22 All of these coking mechanisms will contribute to
blocking of the zeolite micropores, explaining the relatively rapid
deactivation of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts in benzene oxidation. It is important
to mention that ion exchange of ZSM-5 with Fe-salts in various ways
results in poor catalysts for benzene oxidation with nitrous oxide,13,23 mainly because of the more extensive agglomeration of iron.12

Besides the high price of nitrous oxide,
rapid deactivation of
Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts is a serious challenge in realizing a commercial
process for the direct oxidation of benzene using nitrous oxide. Catalyst
stability can be improved by decreasing mass transfer limitations
imposed by the micropore system of Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite. These limitations
are caused by the long intracrystalline pathways that molecules have
to traverse in pores of similar size as reactant and product molecules.
Various strategies have been employed to achieve increased mass transport
such as synthesizing zeolites with extra-large micropores,24 introducing intracrystalline mesopores in zeolite
particles and reducing the zeolite crystal size.25−27 Using diquaternary
ammonium structure directing agents (SDAs), Ryoo and co-workers successfully
synthesized ZSM-5 zeolites with a sheet-like structure with a size
in the b-direction of MFI zeolite limited to several
unit cell dimensions.28,29 By varying the number of ammonium
groups in the hydrophilic headgroup, the thickness of such ZSM-5 zeolite
nanosheets can be controlled.30 Using a
similar diquaternary ammonium SDA, Koekkoek et al. synthesized for
the first time Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets.1 When applied in benzene oxidation, such Fe/ZSM-5 nanosheet zeolites
were found to exhibit higher catalytic activity and longevity than
conventional bulk Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites. As these initial synthesis efforts
were hampered by several issues related to the use of the SDA,31 it was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions
on the influence of the Fe content and crystal size for these promising
nanosheet zeolites as catalysts for the oxidation of benzene to phenol.
The main starting point of the present study was to explore the hypothesis
that consecutive reactions of phenol can be suppressed by (i) lowering
the Fe content and (ii) decreasing the crystal thickness in the b-direction of MFI nanosheets. Therefore, in this work,
we prepared a set of Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets with varying Fe content
by hydrothermal synthesis. The thickness of zeolite nanosheets was
controlled by using di- and tetraquaternary ammonium SDAs [C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C3H7]Br2 and [C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C3H7]Br4. Compared to our earlier work,1 these SDAs are terminated on the short-chain side by a propyl group,
which facilitates crystallization of the structure.31 The structural and textural properties of these materials
were characterized in detail by elemental analysis, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ar porosimetry, and diffuse-reflectance
UV–vis (DR-UV–vis) and UV Raman spectroscopy. The catalytic
performance in the oxidation of benzene to phenol was investigated
for these Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets and their bulk counterparts.
The results are discussed with emphasis on catalyst activity and stability
as a function of nanoscale dimensions of the zeolites.

Synthesis of SDAs
[C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C3H7]Br2 (denoted as C22-6-3·Br2): 3.9 g (0.01 mol) 1-bromo-dococane (TCI, 98%) was dissolved
in 50 mL of toluene (Biosolve, 99.5%) and added dropwise into a 50
mL solution of 21.4 mL (0.1 mol) of N,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-1,6-diaminohexane
(Aldrich, 99%) in ethanol (Biosolve, 99.8%). The solution was refluxed
in an oil bath at 343 K for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature,
the solution was kept at 277 K for 1 h, then filtered and washed with
diethyl ether (Biosolve, 99.5%). The resulting solid product N-(6-(dimethylamino)hexyl)-N,N-dimethyldocosan-1-aminium bromide (denoted as C22-6·Br) was dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K overnight. This intermediate
was subsequently reacted with 4.92 g (0.04 mol) 1-bromopropane (Aldrich,
99%) in ethanol at 343 K for 12 h. The resulting solution was cooled
in a refrigerator at 277 K for 1 h, then filtered, washed with diethyl
ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K. The product was C22-6-3·Br2.

[C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C3H7]Br4 (denoted as C22-6-6-6-3·Br4): 5.62 g (0.01 mol) of C22-6·Br and 24.4 g (0.1 mol) of 1,6-dibromohexane (Aldrich, 96%)
were dissolved in 50 mL ethanol and stirred at 323 K for 24 h. After
cooling to room temperature, the solution was kept at 277 K for 1
h, then filtered and washed with diethyl ether. The resulting solid
product [C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-Br]Br2 (denoted
as C22-6-6-Br·Br2)
was dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K overnight. The intermediate C22-6-6-Br·Br2 and 21.4
mL (0.1 mol) N,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-1,6-diaminohexane
were dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol and refluxed at 343 K for 12 h.
After cooling at 277 K for 1 h, the solution was filtered and washed
with diethyl ether, and the white intermediate [C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N(CH3)2]Br3 (denoted as
C22-6-6-6-0·Br3) was dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K overnight. The compound C22-6-6-6-0·Br3 was
reacted with 4.92 g (0.04 mol) of 1-bromopropane at 343 K in 50 mL
of ethanol for 12 h. Afterward, the liquid mixture was cooled at 277
K for 1 h. The solid product was filtered and washed with diethyl
ether, then dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K for 12 h. The final product
was C22-6-6-6-3·Br4.

Synthesis of Zeolites
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets were
synthesized using C22-6-3·Br2 and C22-6-6-6-3·Br4 as SDAs. In a typical synthesis, NaOH (Merck, 99%) and SDA
were dissolved in demi-water at 333 K for 1 h. After cooling to room
temperature, a second solution which was made by mixing tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS, Merck, 99%), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Aldrich, reagent
grade), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Aldrich, reagent grade), and demi-water
was added under vigorous stirring. The molar ratio of the gel compositions
was as follows: 22 NaOH: 2.5 Al(NO3)3·9H2O: 100 SiO2: 7.5 C22-6-3·Br2 (or 3.25 C22-6-6-6-3·Br4): x Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (x = 0.556, 0.278,
or 0.139): 4000 H2O. After stirring for 1 h, the resultant
gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated under
rotating (60 rpm) at 423 K for 9–25 days.

For the synthesis
of bulk Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, TEOS and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide
(TPAOH, Merck, 40%) were mixed with demi-water and added dropwise
into the solution which was made by dissolving aluminum nitrate nonahydrate
and iron nitrate nonahydrate in demi-water. The molar ratio of the
gel compositions was as follows: 2.5 Al(NO3)3·9H2O: 100 SiO2: 30 TPAOH: x Fe(NO3)·9 H2O (x = 0.556,
0.278, or 0.139): 4500 H2O. After vigorous stirring at
room temperature for 1 h, the resulting gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave and crystallized statically at 448 K for 5 days.

After
crystallization, the products were filtered, washed with
copious amounts of demi-water, and dried overnight at 383 K. The zeolites
were calcined at 823 K for 10 h under flowing air. The calcined zeolites
were ion-exchanged three times with 1 M NH4NO3 solution followed by calcination at 823 K for 4 h under flowing
air in order to obtain their proton forms. The nanosheet zeolites
are denoted as Fe/ZSM-5(xN, y) with x the number of quaternary ammonium ions in templates (2
or 4) and y the Si/Fe ratio in synthesis gel (180,
360, or 720). The bulk zeolites are denoted as Fe/ZSM-5(TPA, y) with y the Si/Fe ratio (180, 360, or
720) in synthesis gel.

Steaming activation was carried out by
heating the samples in a
flow of 10% water vapor in artificial air (100 mL min–1) at 973 K for 3 h. The steamed samples are denoted by using the
suffix “-st”. The details of the syntheses procedure
are collected in Table 1.

Catalyst Characterization
The elemental composition
of the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). To extract metals, samples were dissolved
in a mixture of HF/HNO3/H2O (1:1:1).

DR-UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrometer in diffuse-reflectance
mode with a 60 mm integrating sphere. BaSO4 was used as
the reference. The spectra were transformed into the Kubelka–Munk
function.

UV Raman spectra were recorded with a Jobin-Yvon T64000
triple
stage spectrograph with spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. The laser line at 244 nm of a Lexel 95-SHG laser was used as the
exciting source with an output of 20 mW. The power of the laser at
the sample was about 2 mW.

XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker
D4 Endeavor powder diffraction
system using Cu Kα radiation with a scanning speed of 2.4°
min–1 in the range of 5–60°.

TEM
images were taken on a FEI Tecnai 20 at an electron acceleration
voltage of 200 kV. Prior to measurement, the catalysts were suspended
in ethanol and dispersed over a Cu grid with a holey carbon film.

Surface area and porosity of zeolites were determined by Ar physisorption
in static mode at 87 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The
samples were outgassed at 723 K for 8 h prior to the sorption measurements.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of ZSM-5
zeolite was determined in the relative pressure range (p/p0) 0.05–0.25. The total pore
volume was calculated at p/p0 = 0.97. The micropore (pores <1.0 nm) and supermicropore
(pores in the range of 1.0–2.0 nm) volumes of sheet-like Fe/ZSM-5
zeolites were determined by the NLDFT method (Ar at 87 K assuming
slit pores without regularization). The micropore volume of bulk Fe/ZSM-5
zeolites was determined by the t-plot method via
the Broekhoff–de Boer model in the thickness range of 0.34–0.50
nm. The mesopore volume and pore size distribution were determined
from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the NLDFT method.

Quantification of Active Fe Sites
The amount of active
sites (“α-sites”) in the catalyst was determined
by titration of the catalyst with N2O gas at 523 K. In
a typical procedure, 100 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 125–250
μm) was placed in a stainless-steel microreactor. Prior to testing,
the catalyst was calcined in He (140 mL min–1) from
298 to 823 K at a ramp rate of 2 K min–1, followed
by an isothermal period of 1 h. After cooling the sample to 523 K
in He (140 mL min–1), the He flow was switched to
a reactant flow with the composition 1.03% Ar and 0.98% N2O in He gas at a total flow rate 140 mL min–1.
Argon served as an inert tracer. A well-calibrated mass spectrometer
was used to determine the amount of N2 in the reactor effluent.

Catalytic Activity Measurements
The catalytic activity
of the Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites in the oxidation of benzene to phenol using
N2O as oxidant was determined in a tubular fixed-bed reactor
with 4 mm inner diameter. Typically, an amount of 100 mg of catalyst,
which was pressed and sieved into 125–250 μm particles,
was loaded into a quartz tube. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was
calcined in artificial air (100 mL min–1) to 823
K at a ramp rate of 2 K min–1 followed by an isothermal
period of 2 h. After cooling to 623 K in artificial air, the catalyst
was exposed to the reaction feed mixture which consists of 1 vol %
of benzene and 4 vol % of N2O in He at a total flow rate
of 100 mL min–1. The weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) was 1.89 g g–1 h–1. We
also evaluated the catalytic performance of the best performing catalyst
against its bulk counterpart in excess benzene conditions. For this
purpose, the catalyst was exposed to a reaction feed mixture of 5
vol % of benzene and 0.5 vol % of N2O in He at a total
flow rate of 100 mL min–1 at 643 K. The WHSV was
9.45 g g–1 h–1. The reactor effluent
was analyzed by gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard GC-5890 equipped
with an HP-5 column and a flame ionization detector) and a Balzers-Pfeiffer
quadrupole mass spectrometer. The coke content of the spent catalyst
after a reaction time of 24 h was determined by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) on a TGA/DSC 1 STAR system of Mettler Toledo. The temperature
was increased from 298 to 1273 K with a ramping rate 10 K min–1 under flowing artificial air at a rate of 50 mL min–1.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterization
The XRD patterns of the
calcined and steamed Fe/ZSM-5 samples are collected in Figure 1 and Figure S1. All zeolites have the MFI framework topology.1 No features belonging to large iron oxide particles
were observed, which is indicative for the high Fe dispersion in the
as-synthesized zeolites. Different from bulk zeolite, only the h0l reflections in the XRD patterns of
the nanosheet Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites were sufficiently sharp for indexing.
The absence or strong broadening of the 0k0 reflections
is due to the very small size of the zeolite in the b-direction (i.e., the direction of the straight channels in zeolites
with the MFI topology). The XRD patterns of the steamed samples are
similar to those of the calcined parent ones, which demonstrates the
good hydrothermal stability of bulk and nanosheet Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites.

The elemental compositions of
the zeolites as determined by ICP
elemental analysis are listed in Table 2. All of the zeolites have a similar Si/Al atomic ratio
close to 40. Si/Fe ratios of 180, 360, and 720 in the synthesis gel
led to zeolites with Si/Fe ratios around 180, 360, and 770–850,
respectively. Thus, nearly all Al and Fe ions present in the synthesis
gel were built into the Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites. Steaming did not alter
the elemental composition of the samples.

Figure 2 and Figure S2 display the Ar physisorption isotherms
and pore size distribution of bulk and nanosheet Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites.
The strong uptake at low p/p0 confirms the presence of micropores. Typically, the Fe/ZSM-5
nanosheet zeolites show a gradual uptake over the p/p0 range 0.4–0.9 with a H4 hysteresis
loop, which is characteristic for materials that contain mesopores.
Pore size distribution data demonstrate that the nanosheet zeolites
contain a large amount of mesopores with a wide distribution. For
all bulk zeolites, the mesopore volume is very small. These mesopores
originate from voids between the zeolite crystals.

were vertically offset by equal intervals of 50 cm3 g–1. The pore size distributions were calculated using
the NLDFT method using the adsorption branch and vertically offset
by equal intervals of 0.05 cm3 g–1.

The corresponding textural properties
of these zeolites are listed
in Table 2. The BET
surface area, the total pore volume, and the mesopore volume of the
nanosheet zeolites are significantly higher than those of bulk Fe/ZSM-5
zeolites. The micropore volume of the bulk zeolites is higher than
that of nanosheet zeolites. For nanosheet zeolites, the BET surface
area reached value as high as 540 m2 g–1, and the largest total pore volume was 0.61 cm3 g–1, which is much higher than the micropore volume of
bulk Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite. Mesopores contribute significantly to the total
pore volume of the nanosheet zeolites. It is interesting to note the
relatively small difference in textural properties between calcined
and steamed Fe/ZSM-5(2N,360), underpinning further the very good hydrothermal
stability of the nanosheet zeolites.

Figure 3 shows representative
TEM images of the Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites prepared at a Si/Fe of 360. It
is clear that all of the nanosheet zeolites contain quite narrow a–c planes. The samples synthesized
using the diquaternary ammonium SDA C22-6-3·Br2 consist of uniform unilamellar nanosheets with
a thickness of around 3 nm. Considering that MFI’s unit cell
dimension in the b-direction of 1.974 nm,28,29 the nanosheet zeolites are about 1.5 unit cells thick in this direction.
There is no significant difference in morphology among the nanosheets
with different Fe content (Figure 3a–c). Consistent with the XRD and Ar physisorption
results, TEM images of Fe/ZSM-5(2N,360) before and after steaming
show similar morphology and texture. The nanosheet zeolites synthesized
by SDA C22-6-6-6-3·Br4 (Figure 3e)
are less uniform in terms of thickness in the b-direction.
The on-average ∼6–8 nm thickness in the b-direction of these nanosheets corresponds to about 3–4 unit
cells. The bulk zeolite (Figure 3f) consists of large spherical particles with several
hundreds of nanometers as reported before.27

DRUV–vis and UV Raman Spectroscopy
The coordination
state and extent of aggregation of Fe3+ in Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites
were investigated by DR-UV–vis spectroscopy. The UV–vis
spectra of the calcined and steamed zeolites are shown in Figure 4. The spectra of
the calcined zeolites are dominated by two characteristic oxygen-to-metal
charge-transfer bands around 211 and 245 nm, which are related to
Fe3+ at isolated tetrahedral framework sites.32−34 Thus, we conclude that Fe3+ is predominantly built into
the zeolite framework by isomorphous substitution of Si4+ by Fe3+. The charge-transfer band around 275 nm is typical
for highly dispersed octahedral Fe species.33 Compared to bulk zeolite, the calcined nanosheet zeolites contain
already a certain fraction of highly dispersed extraframework Fe atoms.
This difference points to a less rigid coordination around Fe atoms
in sheet-like MFI zeolites compared with bulk zeolite. This may have
to do with the location of part of the Fe sites near the surface of
the zeolite nanosheets. Steaming results in extensive migration of
tetrahedral Fe species from the crystal framework toward extraframework
positions: oligomeric iron oxide clusters (333 nm), larger Fe2O3-like aggregates (427 nm), and bulk Fe2O3 (545 nm) can be distinguished.1,34 Absent
in bulk zeolite, a distinct shoulder around 275 nm in the spectra
of steamed nanosheet zeolites confirms the presence of a larger fraction
of highly dispersed Fe species inside the nanostructured materials.
The nanosheet zeolites also contain a lower amount of FexOy agglomerates. This
is attributed to the small crystal size in the b-direction,
which limits the agglomeration of Fe atoms during steaming. As expected,
the degree of aggregation of Fe species tends to increase with Fe
loading in both the bulk and nanosheet zeolites.

Figure 5 shows
the
UV Raman spectra (244 nm laser excitation) of calcined and steamed
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites. The strong band at 378 cm–1 observed
for all of the zeolites can be assigned to the characteristic double
five-ring silica moiety in the MFI zeolite.33,35 Two more Raman bands at 480 and 800 cm–1 are also
typical for the MFI structure.35 Upon steaming,
these three peaks did not decrease in intensity, further confirming
the good hydrothermal stability of the zeolites. The band at 516 cm–1 is due to the symmetric stretching/bending vibrational
modes of isolated Fe–O–Si species in the framework,
while the bands at 1015, 1115, and 1165 cm–1 can
be ascribed to the asymmetric Fe–O–Si stretching vibrational
modes.33,34 After steaming, these bands are substantially
broadened or, in some cases, even absent. These changes can be explained
by decreased framework Fe3+ content upon steaming due to
Fe migration toward extraframework positions. Importantly, steaming
results in increased intensity of the band at 743 cm–1, which has been related to active Fe centers for the oxidation of
benzene to phenol in previous studies.1,33 The 743 cm–1 band is already visible in the spectra of the calcined
zeolites. It is more prominent in the spectra of the calcined nanosheet
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites than in those of the calcined bulk zeolites. There
are two possible reasons for this. First, it may be difficult to incorporate
all of the Fe3+ ions in the zeolite framework of the nanosheets,
and, accordingly, already some of the Fe ions end up at extraframework
positions during zeolite synthesis. This is in line with the UV–vis
data. The limited inclusion of heteroatoms in the framework of nanosheet
zeolite has also been observed for Al3+.36,37 Second, it may be that a larger part of the framework Fe3+ ions already migrate into extraframework positions during calcination
of nanosheet zeolites.1

Quantification of “α-Sites”
N2O can be decomposed on “α-sites”
of Fe/ZSM-5
zeolites at 523 K by stoichiometric reaction N2O + ()α = (O)α + N2 (eq 1). Extraframework isolated Fe2+ and oligomeric Fe complexes are usually considered to be
the main species to decompose N2O. Assuming that this reaction
is proceeding via a simple chemisorption of one oxygen atom on each
active site, the number of “α-sites” in catalyst
can be determined by measuring the amount of effluent N2.17,35,38 Active site
densities determined in this manner are collected in Table 3. Before steaming, zeolite nanosheets
contain already more “α-sites” than their bulk
counterparts. This correlates with the higher amount of extraframework
Fe seen in the nanosheet zeolites by DRUV–vis and UV Raman
spectroscopy. Steaming leads to higher “α-sites”
densities in all zeolite samples. This is rationalized by Fe3+ migration from zeolite framework toward extraframework positions.
Except for the calcined and steamed Fe/ZSM-5(2N,360) sample, the “α-sites”
density trends with Fe content. The crystal size of the zeolites does
not significantly affect the “α-sites” density.
The zeolite samples with a Si/Fe ratio of 180 contain more than twice
the amount of “α-sites” than the samples with
Si/Fe ratio of 720.

It
is important to underline that not all the “α-oxygen”
sites formed by stoichiometric N2O decomposition on “α-sites”
exhibit the same activity in benzene conversion. It has been noted
that only isolated Fe2+ in the Fe/ZSM-5 extraframework
position is effective in catalyzing benzene oxidation to phenol. Oligomeric
complexes such as [Fe(μ-O)Fe]2+ and also the ferryl
cations [FeO]+ result in stable grafted phenolate species
upon benzene oxidation. The resulting phenolate complex is so strongly
adsorbed that it blocks the Fe sites. The bulky nature of these species
results in blockage of the micropores.5,19

Catalytic Activity
Measurements
The time on stream
behavior in the catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol for various
calcined and steamed zeolites is displayed in Figure 6. The corresponding data are listed in Table 3. As expected, the
initial benzene conversion, phenol formation rate, and phenol selectivity
(after 5 min on stream) were substantially higher for the steamed
zeolites in comparison to the calcined ones. At the start of the reaction,
the reaction rate is mainly determined by the active site density
(isolated Fe2+). The steamed Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites deactivate
more severely than the calcined ones. This is attributed to the higher
density of isolated Fe2+ and FexOy aggregates in the steamed zeolites.
As a consequence, the total phenol yield in 24 h reaction was substantially
higher for steamed Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites than for their calcined counterparts.
Despite their greater extent of deactivation, steamed Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites
are preferred as catalysts for the oxidation of benzene to phenol.

Figure 6 Rate of
phenol formation as a function of time on stream for bulk
and nanosheet Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by (a) C22-6-3·Br2, (b) C22-6-6-6-3·Br4, and (c) TPAOH (reaction conditions: 1.01 vol
% of C6H6 and 4.01 vol % of N2O in
He; T = 623 K; WHSV = 1.89 g g–1 h–1).

The bulk zeolites deactivate more rapidly than the nanosheet
zeolite
samples. The initial activity of the Fe/ZSM-5(2N,180)-st sample is
higher than that of a similar zeolite catalyst using a less-optimal
SDA.1 For the bulk zeolites, it is seen
that both the activity and the extent of deactivation (ratio of reaction
rate after 24 h and initial reaction rate; R24h/Rinit) increase with Fe content.
Among the steamed 2N Fe/ZSM-5 nanosheet samples, the initial benzene
conversion and phenol formation rate, the extent of deactivation,
and the amount of coke deposited also correlate with Fe content. There
is no clear trend between the phenol selectivity after 5 min on stream
and the Fe content. The bulk zeolites exhibit a lower phenol selectivity,
which can be related to secondary reactions due to longer residence
time of the desired product in the zeolite crystals. Increasing Fe
content led to higher initial activity, although the differences are
less pronounced for the nanostructured zeolite in comparison with
the bulk zeolites.

As mentioned above, not all of the “α-sites”
are active in the benzene to phenol reaction. Therefore, we do not
report turnover frequencies. The higher fraction of inactive “α-sites”
in bulk Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite relates to formation of more dimeric/oligomeric
Fe2+ species in bulk zeolite. A larger contribution of
monomeric Fe2+ in nanosheet samples then explains why variation
in Fe content does not affect the initial activity as much as it does
for bulk zeolite. Higher Fe content in nanosheet zeolites resulted
in faster catalyst deactivation. After 24 h reaction, the phenol formation
rate decreased by 78% for Fe/ZSM-5(2N,180)-st, while only about one-third
of the activity of Fe/ZSM-5(2N,720)-st was lost. Consistent with this,
zeolite nanosheets with higher Fe content produced more coke.

Figure 7 highlights
the trends observed between the density of “α-sites”,
the initial phenol formation rate, and the extent of deactivation
in 24 h with the Fe content of the zeolites. Higher Fe content leads
to a higher density of “α-sites”, regardless of
the crystal size. The “α-sites” density of the
sample prepared at intermediate Fe content with C22-6-3Br2 is an outlier. The higher Fe content also results
in a higher initial phenol formation rate. The nanosheet samples display
a higher rate than the bulk samples. At the same time, the extent
of deactivation trends oppositely with the Fe content. That is to
say, the nanosheet samples deactivate less severely than the bulk
zeolite with the lowest extent of deactivation observed for the thinnest
nanosheets at the lowest Fe content.

We estimated whether
mass transport can limit the reaction rate
of the benzene to phenol reaction. We used the Weisz–Prater
criterion, as the detailed kinetics of benzene oxidation by nitrous
oxide are unknown: 3  Ignoring external mass transfer
by setting
the surface benzene concentration to the bulk gas-phase value of Csurface = 0.2 mol m–3, using
the bulk density of ZSM-5 (0.72 g mL–1) to convert
initial reaction rates to volumetric rates, Lbulk zeolite = 200 nm, Lnanosheet = 1 nm, Deff = 10–13 m2 s–1 for benzene and assuming the
reaction order as 1, we find Φbulk zeolite ≈
4 and Φnanosheet ≈ 10–4.
As we expect that phenol diffuses slightly slower through the zeolite
channels than benzene, we conclude that the reaction rate is limited
by the mass transport of benzene in the bulk zeolite, but not in the
nanosheet zeolite. This difference contributes to the higher initial
rates observed for the zeolite nanosheet samples. We did not observe
a strong correlation between the “α-site” densities
and the initial reaction rate for the nanosheet samples. The main
reason for this should be that not all “α-sites”
are involved in the benzene oxidation reaction, as discussed in the Introduction.

Figure 8 discusses
schematically the decreasing probability of Fe agglomeration sites
in the channels as a function of Fe content. Each MFI unit cell contains
2 straight channels and 96 T atoms. For the thinnest Fe/ZSM-5 nanosheet
zeolite, the number of T atoms amounts to approximately 72 per straight
channel. Thus, a benzene molecule diffusing through Fe/ZSM-5 nanosheet
zeolite with a Si/Fe ratio of 360 will encounter on average much less
than 1 Fe site. This limits the contribution of secondary reactions
of phenol as compared to bulk zeolite. Deactivation is lowered when
the Fe content of the nanosheet zeolite is lowered to Si/Fe = 720.
Nevertheless, coking deactivation will still occur in the nanosheet
zeolites. With decreasing Fe content, the extent of deactivation decreases,
and the value of R24h/Rinit levels off at ∼0.6. In comparison, secondary
reactions play a more important role in bulk zeolite, explaining the
greater extent of deactivation. Even for Si/Fe = 720, R24h/Rinit is 0.33 for bulk
zeolite. The overall coke content for the bulk zeolites is lower than
for the nanosheet samples, which we attribute to the lower utilization
degree of the micropore space. That is to say that the mass transfer
limitations in the bulk zeolite limit the reaction zone of the zeolite
crystal. As the carbonaceous deposits are large, benzene cannot reach
the inner parts of the zeolite anymore. This is the most important
cause of the lower phenol yield for the bulk zeolites. The thicker
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets synthesized with C22-6-6-6-3·Br4 behave in a similar manner with slightly lower
performance as compared with the 2N samples.

Figure 8 Schematic illustration
of influence of Fe content and zeolite domain
size for calcined and steamed Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite.

Overall, the highest catalytic performance was observed for
Fe/ZSM-5(2N,360)-st
with a thickness of 3 nm and on average 0.2 Fe sites per pass through
the straight channels. The phenol productivity was 185 mmol g–1, and the zeolite retained more than half of its initial
activity after 24 h. The reusability of this catalyst was assessed
in three reaction–regeneration cycles. No significant decrease
in its catalytic performance in these experiments was observed, and
phenol productivities remained around 180–200 mmol g–1 after intermittent air calcination at 823 K to burn off the coke.

The textural properties of the spent catalysts were also investigated
by Ar physisorption measurements (Figure 9). The corresponding numerical data are collected
in Table 4. The isotherm
of spent Fe/ZSM-5(TPA,360)-st has the same characteristic type I shape
as the fresh zeolite. Although the isotherms of spent Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite
nanosheets are still of type IV, the area of the hysteresis loop is
significantly smaller than for the fresh zeolites. This is because
part of the mesopores in the spent catalysts are blocked by coke deposits.
The pore size distribution of the spent samples confirms the lowered
mesopore volume. The data in Table 4 illustrate that, compared with the fresh samples,
all of the spent samples have a lower BET surface area and total pore
volume. The decrease of the total pore volume is much more pronounced
for the Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets than for the bulk zeolites. One
reason could be that, compared with bulk Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites, the small
size along the b-direction of zeolite nanosheets
facilitates mass transport, which leads to more efficient utilization
of the micropore space. This contributes to a higher activity of nanosheet
zeolites, as discussed above. The higher utilization degree of the
crystal also leads to a higher amount of coke deposited. Deactivation
due to plugging of pores in naosheet zeolites by carbonaceous deposits
is much less pronounced for the nanosheet zeolites, because of the
much higher surface to bulk ratio. Notably, increasing thickness of
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets in b-direction results
in a stronger decrease of the pore volume during the oxidation reaction.
This is in accordance with the difference in catalytic performance
after 24 h reaction. Textural characterization of the spent nanosheet
zeolites shows that carbonaceous coke was mainly deposited in the
mesopores in nanosheet zeolites. In comparison with spent bulk zeolite,
the micropore volume was less affected. This may be explained by the
shorter diffusion pathways of coke or coke precursors to reach the
external surface of the nanosheet zeolites. As diffusion distances
to the external surface of bulk zeolite are much longer, coke will
be mostly deposited in the micropores.

Panov and co-workers
found that catalyst deactivation due to coking
could be significantly decreased by operating the benzene oxidation
reaction at a high C6H6/N2O ratio,
i.e., in excess benzene.6,39 We also investigated
catalyst performance at a C6H6/N2O ratio of 10 for the best performing Fe/ZSM-5 nanosheet zeolite
(Fe/ZSM-5(2N, 360)-st) and its bulk counterpart (Fe/ZSM-5(TPA, 360)-st)
at a reaction temperature of 643 K. The time on stream plots is shown
in Figure 10, and
the corresponding catalytic performance data are listed in Table S1. Notably, the N2O selectivity
was close to 100%, indicating that phenol was the major product, i.e.,
overoxidation to dihydroxybenzenes is limited under these conditions.
We surmise that the high concentration of benzene lowers the rate
of consecutive oxidation of benzene, suppressing the formation of
heavy byproducts that can deactivate the catalyst. Similar to the
reports of Panov,6,39 catalyst deactivation is much
less pronounced in excess benzene. The initial catalytic activity
of the nanosheet zeolite is about 50% higher than that of the bulk
zeolite. We attribute the lower performance of the bulk zeolite to
mass transport limitations. In accordance with this, we found that
the amount of coke formed on the bulk zeolite under these conditions
is lower than on the nanosheet zeolite (Table S1). This is due to a smaller fraction of the micropore space
being involved in the benzene oxidation reaction.

as a function of time on stream for bulk
and nanosheet Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites (reaction conditions: 5 vol % C6H6 and 0.5 vol % N2O in He; T = 643 K; WHSV = 9.45 g g–1 h–1).

Conclusions
A
set of Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets with thicknesses of ∼3
nm and ∼6–8 nm and with varying Fe content were synthesized,
extensively characterized, and compared to bulk Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite in
the oxidation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide. In all cases,
steaming is effective in increasing the number of active Fe2+ centers for N2O decomposition and benzene oxidation.
The degree of Fe aggregation during steaming increases with the Fe
content and the crystal domain size. These two parameters also strongly
affected the catalytic performance. Decreasing the number of active
centers along the b-direction of the zeolite crystals
strongly suppresses secondary reactions of phenol and, accordingly,
the extent of deactivation. This together with the absence of diffusional
limitations in nanosheet zeolites explains the much higher phenol
yield that can be obtained with nanostructured Fe/ZSM-5. The steamed
Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheet synthesized using C22-6-3·Br2 (domain size in b-direction
∼3 nm) and containing 0.24 wt % Fe exhibited the highest catalytic
performance. During the first 24 h on stream, this catalyst produced
185 mmolphenol g–1. Calcination to remove
the coke deposits completely restores the initial activity. The optimized
catalyst retains its improved activity and stability during benzene
oxidation at a high benzene-to-nitrous oxide ratio.
