Fatty
acid synthase (FASN), the sole protein capable of de novo
synthesis of free fatty acids, is overexpressed in a wide variety
of human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and aggressiveness
of these cancers. Orlistat, an FDA-approved drug for obesity treatment
that inhibits pancreatic lipases in the GI tract, also inhibits the
thioesterase (TE) of human FASN. The cocrystal structure of TE with
orlistat shows a pseudo TE dimer containing two different forms of
orlistat in the active site, an intermediate that is covalently bound
to a serine residue (Ser2308) and a hydrolyzed and inactivated
product. In this study, we attempted to understand the mechanism of
TE-catalyzed orlistat hydrolysis by examining the role of the hexyl
tail of the covalently bound orlistat in water activation for hydrolysis
using molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the hexyl tail
of the covalently bound orlistat undergoes a conformational transition,
which is accompanied by destabilization of a hydrogen bond between
a hydroxyl moiety of orlistat and the catalytic His2481 of TE that in turn leads to an increased hydrogen bonding between
water molecules and His2481 and increased chance for water
activation to hydrolyze the covalent bond between orlistat and Ser2308. Thus, the conformation of the hexyl tail of orlistat
plays an important role in orlistat hydrolysis. Strategies that stabilize
the hexyl tail may lead to the design of more potent irreversible
inhibitors that target FASN and block TE activity with greater endurance.

Introduction
Fatty acid synthase
(FASN) is the sole protein capable of de novo
synthesis of free fatty acids, most commonly 16-carbon palmitate.1 Human FASN is overexpressed in a wide variety
of human cancers, and this overexpression correlates with higher metastatic
potential and poor prognosis.2 FASN overexpression
is also associated with increased resistance to cancer chemotherapeutics
in breast and pancreatic cancer cells,3 indicating that FASN is an attractive target for chemosensitization.

Human FASN consists of seven reaction domains: β-ketoacyl
synthase (KS), malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT), β-hydroxyacyl
dehydrase (DH), enoyl reductase (ER), β-ketoacyl reductase (KR),
acyl carrier protein (ACP), and thioesterase (TE).4 De novo synthesis of fatty acids by FASN begins with condensation
of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, and continues with elongation of the
fatty acid chain, which is tethered to the phosphopantetheine cofactor
of ACP, via a repeating cycle that adds two carbons each cycle.5 At the end of elongation, TE cleaves the thioester
bond between the fatty acid chain and the phosphopantetheine of ACP
and releases the free fatty acid.6

The TE domain of FASN is a member of the serine hydrolase family,
with the canonical Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad. The
hydrolysis of the thioester bond between fatty acid and the phosphopantetheine
of ACP involves the acceptance of a hydrogen atom from His2481 by the sulfur atom of the phosphopantetheine and the transfer of
fatty acid chain to Ser2308, forming an acyl-enzyme intermediate.
Then the catalytic nitrogen atom of His2481 hydrogen bonds
and activates a water molecule, which then undergoes nucleophilic
attack of the carbonyl carbon of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and
releases the fatty acid from Ser2308 and regenerates Ser2308 and His2481.7 Active
site inhibitors of FASN TE including orlistat can prevent the transfer
of fatty acid from ACP to Ser2308 of TE.

Orlistat
(Figure 1A) is an FDA-approved
drug for obesity treatment that inhibits pancreatic lipases in the
gastrointestinal tract, but has also been shown to inhibit TE of FASN.8 In addition, orlistat sensitizes FASN-mediated
drug resistance in breast and pancreatic cancer cells;3 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress,9 apoptosis,10 G1/S arrest in
cancer cells;11 and inhibits angiogenesis
and proliferation of endothelial cells,12 possibly by inhibiting FASN. Computational docking analysis shows
that orlistat binds to the ligand binding site in TE,13 and the cocrystal structure of human FASN TE with orlistat
(ID: 2PX6) shows
that orlistat is indeed present in the active site of TE.14 Interestingly, in the same cocrystal structure,
orlistat exists both as a hydrolyzed product and as a covalently bound
intermediate (covalent-orlistat), in which the C1 carbon of the β-lactone
cyclic ester moiety of orlistat forms a covalent bond with the active
site Ser2308 (Figure 1A). In addition,
the hexyl tail of orlistat appears to adopt two different conformations
in the covalent-orlistat and hydrolyzed product. It was speculated
that the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat may pack against His2481 and prevent the access and activation of a water molecule
needed for hydrolysis of the covalent bond between orlistat and Ser2308.14 However, whether the conformation
transition of the hexyl tail occurs prior to the catalysis, and whether
and how the transition contributes to catalysis is unknown.

Figure 1 (A) Catalytic
mechanism of orlistat hydrolysis by FASN TE. The
active site Ser2308 of TE nucleophilically attacks the
C1 carbon of the β-lactone moiety of orlistat to
form a covalent bond between Ser2308 and orlistat. Orlistat
is then hydrolyzed and inactivated by TE. The ω dihedral angle
of the hexyl tail that defines conformations I and II is depicted
in red. (B) Alignment of average structures of covalent-orlistat in
conformations I (cyan) and II (magenta) from the first simulation
and the hydrolyzed orlistat from the crystal structure (orange). The
Ser2308 portion of covalent-orlistat is shown in green,
and the hydrolyzed group in hydrolyzed orlistat is shown in light
green.

In this study, we examined the
potential role of the hexyl tail
in water activation for orlistat hydrolysis using molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and found that the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat
shifts from one conformation to another within 35 ns simulations.
However, the shift of the hexyl tail does not increase the accessibility
of water molecules to the active site. Instead, this shift destabilizes
a hydrogen bond between the catalytic nitrogen atom of His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety of covalent-orlistat, allowing a water molecule
to be activated via hydrogen bonding with His2481 in a
proper orientation for catalysis. Taken together, we conclude that
the hexyl tail in covalent-orlistat can shift from one conformation
to another, which plays an important role in orlistat hydrolysis by
TE.

Experimental Methods
Orlistat Parameterization
Covalent-orlistat
is a non-natural
residue, and therefore, parameters must be developed for Molecular
Mechanics (MM) calculations. To achieve this goal, the coordinates
of covalent-orlistat in TE were acquired from the Protein Data Bank
(ID: 2PX6).
The charges for covalent-orlistat are developed manually by a similar
procedure described by Cornell et al.15 Briefly, covalent-orlistat and Ser2308, as well as the
adjacent tyrosine residues (Tyr2307 and Tyr2309) on either side of Ser2308, were removed from the enzyme
and capped by retaining the peptide backbone from Tyr2307 and Tyr2309, resulting in an N-terminal blocking cap
that consists of a −(CO–CH3) group and a
C-terminal blocking cap that consists of a −(NH–CH3) group (Supporting Information, Figure
S1A). The model system was optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level
of theory using the Quantum Mechanics (QM) package Gaussian03. Bond
lengths and angles were optimized with dihedral angles between all
heavy atoms kept frozen, to ensure that the charge development of
orlistat reflects the charge distribution of the conformation seen
in the crystal structure. The electrostatic
potential of the ligand was then calculated with Gaussian03 using
the HF/6-31G* level of quantum mechanical theory. Next, the atomic
charges of the ligand were calculated in two steps by restrained electrostatic
potential (RESP) charge fitting. In the first step, the charges of
the caps, which sum to zero, were defined and the charges for the
remainder of the atoms were calculated by RESP. In the second step,
charges for all atoms were fixed except for methyl (−CH3) and methylene (−CH2) hydrogens. Charge
calculations were repeated to ensure that rotationally degenerate
atoms had equivalent charges. We intended to introduce as few new
parameters as possible, and analogy to the existing ff03 atom types
allowed us to define all missing values for covalent-orlistat (see Supporting Information, Figure S2A and Table
S1 for more information). Using UCSF Chimera,16 the caps were then removed, and the orlistat-Ser2308 residue
was reattached to the enzyme by aligning the newly optimized molecule
with the original orlistat molecule, as seen previously by Pemble
et al.14

Validation of Covalent-Orlistat
Parameterization
To
verify that the MM parameters developed for covalent-orlistat agree
with optimal geometries of the ω dihedral angle determined by
QM, a rotational dihedral scan with angles differing by 10 degrees
was performed by both ab initio QM and MM. The initial structure used
for the dihedral angle scan was prepared as follows: Covalent-orlistat,
previously optimized by Gaussian03 as mentioned above, and the two
residues adjacent to orlistat were removed from the rest of the enzyme
using Chimera. These tyrosine residues were modified to N-terminal
and C-terminal glycine residues to create a 3-mer peptide containing
covalent-orlistat (Supporting Information, Figure
S1B). To avoid electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal
amino group and the C-terminal carboxyl group, the torsion angles
of this 3-mer peptide were adjusted into an extended conformation.
The thirty-six rotamers of the ω dihedral angle were created
using Chimera. The single point ab initio energy of each rotamer was
calculated using Gaussian03 with the HF/6-31G* level of quantum mechanical
theory. On the MM side, the potential energy surface of the 3-mer
peptide was calculated using a nonperiodic vacuum model with the sander
module of AMBER. Each rotamer was minimized using 500 steps of steepest
descent minimization. To ensure that the conformation of each rotamer
was not changed dramatically during minimization, all atoms were weakly
restrained by 25 kcal/mol/Å2 in Cartesian space using
harmonic potential.

Molecular Modeling and MD Simulation
Missing loops
in the crystal structure of TE were modeled using ModLoop.17 Both the ff03 parameters and hydrogen atoms
were assigned to the protein by the
LeAP module of AMBER9. LeAP also added TIP3 water molecules to solvate
the structure in a box with a distance of 8 Å between the wall
and the closest atom in the system, in addition to appropriate counterions
to neutralize the system. To calculate the long-range electrostatic
interactions, Particle Mesh Ewald was used. The nonbonded cutoff was
set to 8.0 Å. Prior to performing a production MD simulation,
the system was equilibrated by a five-step protocol. First, the solvated
system was minimized by 500 steps of steepest descent minimization
followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization with all
protein–ligand atoms in the system being restrained by 500
kcal/mol/Å2 in Cartesian space using harmonic potential.
Next, the energy of the whole system was minimized by removing the
restraints in place and 10 000 steps of steepest descent minimization
followed by 15 000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization.
In the third step, the system was heated with a restraint of 10 kcal/mol/Å2 to the protein from 0 to 300 K gradually over a duration
of 50 ps controlled by Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency
of 2 ps–1. The system was then equilibrated by constant
pressure dynamics simulation with a weak restraint of 10 kcal/mol/Å2 to the protein with isotropic position scaling for 50 ps
at 300 K. The reference pressure was set as 1 bar, with a pressure
relaxation time of 1.0 ps. Finally, the system was further and fully
equilibrated for additional 60 ps at 300 K using constant volume periodic
boundaries, which was indicated by stable structure, energies, and
temperatures. This step was controlled by Langevin dynamics with a
collision frequency of 2 ps–1 and a pressure relaxation
time of 2 ps. The SHAKE procedure, which weakly constrains bonds involving
hydrogen atoms, was applied to each step of the simulation. A total
of 35 ns of production MD were simulated using the same conditions
as the equilibration step. Two replicate simulations were performed
using the same initial structure and the same conditions. An MD simulation
with a truncated version of orlistat in which the hexyl tail was virtually
changed to a methyl group (Supporting Information,
Figure S1C) was also performed using the same procedure described
above. Additionally, the 3-mer peptide containing covalent-orlistat
was solvated and a total of 100 ns of production MD were simulated
using the above same procedure. To examine the effects of crystal
packing on the behavior of covalent-orlistat, a simulation for FASN
TE chains involving crystal contacts that may affect the covalent-orlistat
binding mode was performed for 35 ns using the same procedure described
above, but equilibrated for 5 ns due to the interchain movements.

Free Energy Calculations
To examine the free energy
of the covalent-orlistat ligand in each hexyl tail conformation, a
total of 50 snapshots over the course of each conformation in each
simulation were extracted from the simulation trajectories of FASN
TE. The free energy was calculated and decomposed to covalent-orlistat
residue using the MM_PBSA module of AMBER by the equation PBtot = PBsol + gas, where PBsol = PBsur + PBcal and gas = ELE + VDW + INT. PBsur is
described as the hydrophobic contributions to solvation free energy
for PB calculations, and PBcal is described as the reaction
field energy calculated by PB. ELE is the nonbonded electrostatic
energy +1,4-electrostatic energy; VDW is the nonbonded van der Waals
energy +1,4-van der Waals energy; and INT is the bond, angle, and
dihedral energies. Additionally, to demonstrate that the two conformations
of covalent-orlistat are independent, distinct, and not a result of
the influence from the protein, two 100 ns trajectories were run for
the 3-mer peptide, which is composed of covalent-orlistat bonded to
Ser flanked by two Gly residues, and the free energy decomposed to
covalent-orlistat was evaluated with a total of 50 snapshots in each
conformation using the MM_PBSA module.

Trajectory Analysis
The conformational transition throughout
the simulation was studied by analyzing the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of covalent-orlistat and the ω dihedral angle of the
hexyl tail by ptraj. To monitor structural stability, RMSD, root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF), and secondary structure analysis were calculated
by the ptraj module of AMBER9. Water molecules in the active site
of the enzyme were determined using VMD by searching for the water
molecules within 3.5 Å of the catalytic nitrogen of His2481 and within 4.0 Å of the carbonyl carbon of covalent-orlistat
that the water molecule attacks. Hydrogen bonds between polar atoms
(N, O, S, F) in the system were examined using VMD with the criteria
of a donor–acceptor distance of 3.5 Å and an angle cutoff
of 20 degrees. The donor–acceptor distance for strong hydrogen
bonding required for catalysis between water molecules and His2481 was set to 3.0 Å. Finally, all statistical calculations
were performed using a two-tailed student’s t test with Prism5 (GraphPad).

Results
Covalent-Orlistat
MM Parameter Verification by Quantum Mechanics
Figure 1A shows the structures of free ,
covalent-, and hydrolyzed orlistat. The two conformations adopted
by the hexyl tails in covalent- and hydrolyzed orlistat in TE in the
crystal structure were assigned as conformations I and II (Figure 1B), respectively, which are defined by the ω
angle of the hexyl tail (Figure 1A,B). The
hexyl tail of the covalent-orlistat in conformation I has an ω
angle of 337.97° and is accommodated in pocket I or “short-chain
pocket” defined by residues Thr2342, Tyr2343, and Tyr2462 of TE while the hexyl tail of hydrolyzed
orlistat in conformation II has an ω angle of 139.54° and
interacts with residues in pocket II or “shift pocket”
defined by residues Tyr2309, Tyr2343, and Ala2430 as previously described.14

In order to examine the behavior of covalent-orlistat within the
active site of TE prior to hydrolysis using an MD simulation approach,
we first parametrized the Ser2308 residue covalently bound
to orlistat using the well-established procedure from the AMBER manual
(see Experimental Methods and Supporting Information).18 We next tested if our developed AMBER parameters could reproduce
the ab initio energy profile for the ω dihedral angle of the
hexyl tail that defines conformation I and II in the crystal structure
by performing QM and MM dihedral angle scans of a 3-mer peptide containing
covalent-orlistat attached to a Ser residue in the middle (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2B, the MM method using the AMBER parameters yielded
an energy profile that is very similar to the curve generated by the
ab initio method, with both profiles showing two minima and two maxima.
The two maxima appeared at 8.2° and 248.2° in the ab initio
curve and at 5.3° and 246.8° in the MM curve, indicating
a good agreement. The two minima appeared at 158.2° and 308.2°
in the ab initio curve and at 158.4° and 306.4° in the MM
curve, which not only agree with each other very well but are similar
to the ω angles (139.54° and 337.97°) of the hexyl
tail of covalent- and hydrolyzed orlistat found in the crystal structure,
respectively. Interestingly, the QM energy barrier separating the
two hexyl tail conformations is 28.35 kcal/mol, which is considerably
high. Thus, we conclude that covalent-orlistat was parametrized properly
for MD simulations and that the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat may
adopt two distinct conformations, as observed in the crystal structure,
before hydrolysis.

Two Distinct Conformations of the Hexyl Tail
in Covalent-Orlistat
To show that the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat
can adopt both
ω angle conformations observed in the crystal structure without
the influences from TE, and that these conformations are energetically
equivalent and independent conformations, we performed a 100 ns MD
simulation of the 3-mer peptide containing covalent-orlistat (Supporting Information, Figure S1B). As shown
in Supporting Information, Figure S2C,
the ω dihedral angle begins at 303.79 ± 8.90° and
changes to 178.53 ± 14.59° at 12.55 ns. It then flips back
to 305.61 ± 9.68° at 52.09 ns. At 56.39 ns, the ω
dihedral angle adopts 174.48 ± 15.44° again for the remainder
of the simulation. The conformations of the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat
with these two major ω dihedral angles are similar to conformations
I and II as observed in the cocrystal structure and, thus, covalent-orlistat
without TE may adopt the same two conformations prior to hydrolysis.
In addition, the calculated free energies of the 3-mer peptide containing
covalent-orlistat in both conformations are nearly identical with
an energy of −329.61 ± 7.55 kcal/mol in conformation I
and −330.52 ± 7.81 kcal/mol in conformation II. Thus,
we conclude that, without influence from the surrounding amino acid
residues of TE, the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat can adopt two
distinct but energetically equivalent and interchangeable conformations
that are similar to the conformations seen in the cocrystal structure.

Compatibility of Covalent-Orlistat MM Parameters with AMBER
Force Field
To further determine whether the developed parameters
of covalent-orlistat are compatible with the AMBER force field, we
examined MM minimizations of the model system of TE in complex with
covalent-orlistat in an explicit water environment. The developed
parameters successfully minimized the initial structure with a convergence
criterion of 1.0 kcal mol–1 Å–1. During the 60 ps equilibration period of the simulation, the RSMD
of the whole protein was stable and remained less than 1.5 Å.
To confirm that the AMBER parameters of covalent-orlistat are suitable
for MD simulation studies, we monitored various parameters during
35 ns MD simulations. Both the temperature and energy remained constant
with little deviation during equilibration and production MD runs
of all three simulations. The RMSD of the main chain atoms (RMSDTE) is less than 2.0 Å during the entire simulation process
(Figure 2A), which is consistently observed
in all three simulations. These findings indicate that the overall
protein structure is not disrupted or distorted throughout the simulations.
The secondary structure of each residue is kept and agrees highly
with the crystal structure. More importantly, the simulated B-factors
of the protein (B-factorTE) and covalent-orlistat (B-factororlistat) are comparable to the experimentally determined values14 (Supporting Information,
Figure S2D). Thus, we conclude that the parametrization is
appropriate and compatible with the current AMBER force field.

first simulation. Times when the conformational transition begins
and completes are indicated. (B) ω dihedral angle of the hexyl
tail of covalent-orlistat in the orlistat-TE complex along the simulation.

Conformational Transition
of the Hexyl Tail in the FASN TE Domain
The above studies
showed that, in the absence of the TE protein,
covalent-orlistat in the 3-mer peptide is able to adopt two different
conformations for the hexyl tail, defined by the ω dihedral
angle, that are independent and exchangeable. To determine if a conformational
transition can also occur to the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat in
its binding pocket of the TE domain, and whether this transition has
any effect on orlistat hydrolysis, we first examined the conformation
of the hexyl tail during the three independent 35 ns simulations of
the TE-covalent-orlistat complex.

The conformational transition
of the hexyl tail can be examined by two criteria: the RMSD and the
ω dihedral angle of the covalent-orlistat. We first examined
the RMSD value of covalent-orlistat throughout each simulation and
observed that the hexyl tail remained in one conformation, as noted
by a stable RMSD, during the initial 3400 ps of the simulation until
transitioning to a second conformation, which was completed at 18
250 ps when the RMSD of covalent-orlistat regained stability (Figure 2A). Similar conformational transitions but at different
times were also observed in two other independent simulations with
time spans of each conformation shown in Table 1 and Figure S3A, B. In the Supporting Information,
Supplemental Video S1 shows a representative simulation of
the conformational transition of the hexyl tail.

tail adopted each conformation in each simulation was determined by

was not included in our calculations.

b Standard deviation.

We next determined if the two conformations observed in these simulations
are equivalent to and possibly represent conformations I and II observed
in the crystal structure, by examining the ω dihedral angles
throughout each simulation. We found that there is a clear change
in the ω angle between the two stable states of covalent-orlistat
(Figure 2B, Supporting
Information, S3A, B). In the three simulations, the average
ω angles ranges from 304.89 to 309.73° in stable state
I and 172.68° to 176.32° in stable state II. Strikingly,
the average ω angles in stable state I and II is respectively
similar to the ω angles in conformation I (308.2°) and
II (158.2°) determined by the ab initio method (Supporting Information, Figure S2B). Furthermore, the average
ω angles are also similar to the ω angles of the two conformations
in the crystal structure. These observations demonstrate that the
two stable states of covalent-orlistat seen in the simulations indeed
correspond to conformation I and II determined by ab initio method
and crystal structure. It is noteworthy that there is a brief reversion
of the ω angle from conformation II back to I and then a second
ω angle transition to conformation II (at ∼11 440–11 870
ps) was observed (Figure 2B). This is consistent
with the ω dihedral angle transition noted with the 3-mer peptide.

Next, the free energy of the covalent-orlistat within TE in conformations
I and II was calculated. Their free energies are nearly equivalent,
ranging from −131.60 ± 7.03 to −130.29 ± 6.21
kcal/mol in conformation I and −139.05 ± 6.26 to −135.25
± 7.19 kcal/mol in conformation II (Table 1), indicating that conformation II is unlikely a simple relaxation
of conformation I. Together, these data show that the hexyl tail of
covalent-orlistat in TE has shifted from conformation I to II during
our simulations, which may resemble the conformational transition
during catalysis as suggested by the crystal structure.

Interactions
of the Hexyl Tail with the Binding Pockets
As discussed above,
there are two pockets of residues in the crystal
structure that accommodate the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat in
conformation I and hydrolyzed orlistat in conformation II and they
are called short-chain pocket and shift pocket, respectively.14 The short-chain pocket (or pocket I as we refer
to) consists of residues Thr2342, Tyr2343, and
Tyr2462, and the shift pocket (or pocket II) consists of
residues Tyr2309, Tyr 2343, and Ala2430. To examine how the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat interacts with
each set of residues during our simulations, the average structure
of the protein with covalent-orlistat in conformation I and II from
a representative simulation was aligned with the crystal structures
of covalent-orlistat and hydrolyzed orlistat, respectively. As shown
in Figure 3A, the hexyl tail in conformation
I clearly interacts intensively with the pocket I residues, but not
as much with pocket II residues. In addition, pocket I residues in
the simulated average structure adopt similar conformations to the
crystal structure. However, the similarity of pocket II residues between
the simulated and crystal structures is not as high (Figure 3B). Although Tyr2309 and Ala2430 can be aligned very well, it appears that Tyr2343 adopts
very different conformation from the crystal structure. In the crystal
structure, Tyr2343 packs against the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat
in conformation I, but it then undergoes conformation transition and
does not pack against the hexyl tail of the hydrolyzed orlistat in
conformation II. This observation raised the possibility that the
conformational change of Tyr2343 may promote shifting of
the hexyl tail. In the simulations, however, the positioning of Tyr2343 changes very little before and after the hexyl tail shifts
and it continues to pack against the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat
in conformation II. This difference in the conformation of Tyr2343 may be a result of the hydrolysis because we are comparing
the covalent-orlistat in the simulated average structure with the
hydrolyzed orlistat in the crystal structure. This finding suggests
that the conformation transition of Tyr2343 may happen
after the conformation transition of the hexyl tail, and instead of
promoting conformation transition of the hexyl tail, it may facilitate
the release of the hydrolyzed orlistat.

adopts conformation I is aligned with the crystal structure of covalent-orlistat
(pink). (B) The average structure (cyan) from the simulation when
hexyl tail adopts conformation II is aligned with the crystal structure
of the hydrolyzed orlistat (pink). In both panels, orlistat, shown
in gray with the hexyl tail in dark green, short-chain (Thr2342, Tyr 2343 and Tyr2462), and shift pocket residues
(Tyr2309, Tyr 2343, Ala2430) are
depicted.

Crystal Packing Favors
the Hexyl Tail in Conformation I
To understand whether crystal
contacts have any effects on the conformation
of the hexyl tail, multiple FASN TE chains were created by crystal
symmetry operation and were used to perform another 35 ns MD simulation.
Due to the crowdedness effect of the crystal lattice, residues Arg2352, Thr2356, Pro2357, Gly2358, Cys2359, Glu2360, and Ala2361 in
a different chain (chain B) directly interact with the covalent-orlistat
in the current chain (chain A). In addition, residues Tyr2347 and Thr2348 in chain B may indirectly affect hexyl tail
conformation via interacting with pocket I residues of chain A. RMSD
and ω angle of the covalent-orlistat in both subunits were examined.
Unlike our previous simulations containing only one FASN TE chain,
the hexyl tail of the covalent-orlistat molecule in chain A was constrained
in conformation I as indicated by the ω angle (Figure 4A) and the low and stable RMSD (Figure 4B) throughout the simulation. Interestingly, when
examining the covalent-orlistat molecules in chain B, the molecules
behave similarly to the covalent-orlistat molecules from our FASN
TE monomer simulations (Supporting Information,
Figure S4).

Catalytically Critical Interactions at the
Active Site
We first tested whether the shift of the hexyl
tail may provide access
of water molecules to the TE active site proposed by Pemble et al.14 by searching for water molecules that are ≤3.5
Å to the catalytic nitrogen of histidine and ≤4.0 Å
to the carbonyl carbon atom of the covalent bond between orlistat
and serine.19 Under this stringent condition,
it appears that in both conformations, the active site can be occupied
by a water molecule for a significant amount of the time (Table 2). We next determined whether the conformational
transition affects the catalytically important salt bridge between
Asp2338 and His24817b (Figure 5A). The constant occupancy of this
salt bridge suggests that Asp2338 and His2481 couple tightly both before and after conformational transition of
the hexyl tail, and its stability is not affected by the conformational
transition (Figure 5B top panel, Table 2).

In
addition to the salt bridge, we identified a hydrogen bond between
the catalytic nitrogen of His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety
of covalent-orlistat (Figure 5A). In contrast
to the occupancy of the Asp2338-His2481 salt
bridge, the average occupancy of this hydrogen bond over all three
simulations dropped significantly from 55.8% in conformation I to
19.3% in conformation II (Table 2, Figure 5B bottom panel). This agrees with the increased
distance between the catalytic nitrogen of His2481 and
the oxygen of the hydroxyl moiety of covalent-orlistat when the hexyl
tail adopts conformation II (Figure 5C, Table 2). A similar increase in this distance was also
observed for the second and third simulations (Table 2). These results indicate that in each simulation, the potential
for orlistat and His2481 to form a hydrogen bond is diminished
following the conformational transition. Therefore, the conformational
transition of the hexyl tail does not appear to affect the salt bridge
but destabilizes the hydrogen bond between the catalytic nitrogen
of His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety of covalent-orlistat.

Activation of Catalytic Water Molecules
To further
understand how the conformational change of the hexyl tail affects
catalysis, we next investigated the presence of potentially activated
water molecules in the active site of TE with orlistat in both conformations
using the following criteria. A catalytically active water molecule
(a) must strongly hydrogen bond with His2481 (at a distance
≤3.0 Å); (b) must be ≤4.0 Å from the carbonyl
carbon atom of covalent-orlistat for nucleophilic attack; and (c)
must form an optimal catalytic orientation angle of 105° ±
5° with the carbonyl carbon and the carbonyl oxygen (Figure 6A).20 The average occupancy
of water molecules that meet all the three criteria is significantly
increased from 0.1% in conformation I to 4.6% in conformation II (Table 2). This observation suggests that when the hexyl
tail is in conformation I, a water molecule is unlikely to be catalytically
activated and the possibility of catalytic activation is significantly
increased after the hexyl tail transitions to conformation II.

(Δ) simulation. (C) The occupancy of the hydrogen bond between
the truncated covalent-orlistat and His2481 throughout

Correlation of Interactions
in the Active Site
To understand
how the conformational transition may affect the chance of activation
of a water molecule for catalysis, we analyzed the ability of water
molecules to form strong hydrogen bonds (≤3.0 Å) with
the catalytic nitrogen of His2481 before and after the
conformational transition of the hexyl tail. As shown in Table 2, the occupancy of water molecules that can strongly
hydrogen bond with His2481 is increased from an average
of 11% in conformation I to 40% in conformation II (p = 0.051).

Considering that there is a decrease in hydrogen
bonding between His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety of covalent-orlistat
and an increase in hydrogen bonding between His2481 and
water molecules, it is possible that these two events are correlated.
To test this possibility, we first calculated the occupancy of the
hydrogen bond between His2481 and covalent-orlistat when
there is a water molecule in the active site that satisfies all catalytic
criteria, which was 0.7%, 0.8% and 1.0% in the first, second and third
simulation, respectively. We then performed a correlation analysis
of the occupancy of the hydrogen bond between His2481 and
covalent-orlistat and the occupancy of activated water molecules that
satisfy all criteria for a catalytic interaction in both conformations
I and II. As shown in Figure 6B, there is a
clear trend of linear correlation between these occupancies with a
correlation coefficient of 0.94, indicating that a water molecule
is more likely to catalytically interact with orlistat in the absence
of the hydrogen bond between covalent-orlistat and His2481. Together, the above findings suggest that the hydrogen bond between
covalent-orlistat and His2481 may need to be abrogated
to successfully activate a catalytic water molecule.

Simulation
of Truncated Orlistat Lacking the Hexyl Tail
The above findings
suggest that conformation I of the hexyl tail
may help stabilize the hydrogen bond between His2481 and
covalent-orlistat. To test this possibility, we performed an MD simulation
analysis using a truncated covalent-orlistat lacking the hexyl tail
(Supporting Information, Figure S1C). For
this purpose, the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat in the crystal structure
was virtually removed, parametrized, and simulated similarly as described
above for the intact orlistat. Figure 6C shows
that the hydrogen bond between His2481 and the hydroxyl
group of truncated covalent-orlistat was spontaneously and quickly
disrupted at 8,190 ps. It remained in a disrupted state and did not
reform for any significant amount of time during the remainder of
the simulation. Interestingly, the occupancy of water molecules that
can be potentially activated before and after disruption of the hydrogen
bond is 0.9% and 4.3%, respectively, which is consistent with the
observations of intact covalent-orlistat. Taken together with the
results for intact covalent-orlistat, we conclude that the hexyl tail
in conformation I likely stabilizes the hydrogen bond between His2481 and covalent-orlistat, which prevents His2481 from hydrogen bonding with and properly orienting and activating
a water molecule for catalysis in the active site.

Discussion
The serine hydrolases are one of the largest classes of enzymes
and their catalytic mechanism has been studied since the 1960s.21 The action of the canonical Ser–His–Asp
catalytic triad has been extensively studied by experiments such as
mutagenesis combined with enzymatic assays,22 X-ray crystallography,22,23 and NMR,24 as well as by QM/MM computations.25 The cleavage of the substrate involves two major
steps. First, the proton of the catalytic serine is abstracted by
the histidine. The Oγ of Ser nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl
carbon of the substrate to be hydrolyzed, forming a tetrahedral oxyanion
intermediate. This intermediate collapses shortly and an acylenzyme
is formed, which completes the acylation step of the reaction. In
the second step, a water molecule is activated by deprotonation by
the histidine, similar to the serine in the acylation reaction. The
activated water molecule attacks the central carbonyl atom of the
acylenzyme ester bond and forms an anionic tetrahedral intermediate
again. Similarly, this intermediate collapses and results in the release
of a carboxylic acid and regeneration of the active site.

FASN
TE shares the canonical catalytic triad with other serine
hydrolases.26 The hydrogen bond network
at the catalytic site is well-suited for the above catalytic mechanism
and is also similar to other serine hydrolases.26a,27 The special feature of the cocrystal structure of human FASN TE
with orlistat (ID: 2PX6), however, is that orlistat is present in the active site of TE
in two states: a state covalently bound to the enzyme indicating a
reaction stopped at first step and a state of hydrolyzed product indicating
a completed reaction. Interestingly, the hexyl tail of orlistat in
these two different states adopts two different conformations (I and
II). Whether the hexyl tail shifts before or after the reaction completion
and whether and how the shift dominates the advancement to the second
step of the catalysis is not clear.

In this study, we modeled
covalent-orlistat in a 3-mer peptide
and found that the two conformations in the crystal structure are
stable conformations and energetically equivalent as determined using
both QM and MM methods. This finding suggests that the covalent-orlistat
can adopt both conformations prior to hydrolysis. In addition, the
finding that the hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat in the 3-mer peptide
can transit back and forth freely between conformations I and II shown
by MM method further indicates that the conformational transition
of the hexyl tail may play a critical role in the advancement of the
catalysis to the second step. The fact that the two energetically
equivalent conformations captured in the crystal structure are not
equally reactive and the fact that the hexyl tail is not the site
for the hydrolysis to happen suggest that the hexyl tail may exert
its effects on the protein in large scale. Although combined quantum
and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method can predict activation barriers
and stationary structural points for enzymatic reactions based on
potential energy surfaces, it requires predefining up to only a few
hundred QM atoms within a system.28 This
prerequisite limits the use of this method to solve the problem in
this study. Because the conformational transition of the hexyl tail
does not involve bond-breaking or -forming, the MM approach can be
used to investigate the large scale effect of the hexyl tail on the
enzyme. Our study shows that the hexyl tail in conformation I prevents
the activation of a water molecule because of a hydrogen bond between
the catalytic His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety of orlistat.
The conformation transition of the hexyl tail destabilizes this hydrogen
bond and leads to formation of a hydrogen bond between His2481 and water molecules, allowing the activation of a water molecule
to hydrolyze the covalent bond between orlistat and Ser2308. Therefore, the conformation transition of the hexyl tail is critical
and required for hydrolysis of covalent-orlistat. Here, we applied
distance criteria and the Bürgi–Dunitz rule20 in identifying an “activated”
water molecule in the MM computational setting. Further studies using
QM/MM methods once an “activated” water molecule is
identified by the MM method can investigate the bond breaking process
and the complete reaction pathways, which may provide further support
for the above findings by the MM methods.

Another interesting
observation from the complex structure solved
by Pemble et al. is the structure is that the result of cocrystallization
of TE and orlistat, not from a crystal soaking experiment. During
the lengthy cocrystallization process, protein and ligand are coincubated
in solution and can freely react with each other without crystal packing
restraints that are present in crystal soaking experiment.14 Yet in this condition, only some of orlistat
is hydrolyzed, suggesting that the nonhydrolyzed covalent-orlistat
cannot be a result solely from crystal packing. Rather, the crystal
lattice may selectively pack TE with covalent-orlistat in conformation
I from solution in one asymmetric unit and TE with hydrolyzed orlistat
in conformation II from solution in another asymmetric unit. Once
crystals are formed, the covalent-orlistat in conformation I may not
be able to transit to conformation II due to crystal lattice restraint
and therefore remain in nonhydrolyzed state. Our simulation data agrees
with the crystal structures and the above mechanism. In all our water-explicit
simulations mimicking TE in solution without crystal contacts, the
hexyl tail of covalent-orlistat undergoes a transition from conformation
I to II indicated by its RSMD and the ω angle, whereas the subunit
subjected to crystal packing is stabilized in conformation I.

We observed that the ω angles of covalent-orlistat in the
3-mer peptide can switch between conformation I and II freely. We
also observed that the ω angles of hexyl tail in TE can switch
between conformation I and II. However, most of the time, covalent-orlistat
in TE adopts conformation II, raising the possibility that the binding
of free TE in solution may stabilize conformation II. This agrees
with the calculated free energies of covalent-orlistat in TE, which
suggest conformation II is slightly more favorable. The slight preference
to conformation II in free TE could be important for the conversion
of orlistat, and it ensures sufficient time in conformation II for
hydrolysis, which could be considerably quick compared with the conformation
transition, to happen. This conclusion is supported by the fact that
no covalent-orlistat in conformation II is captured in the cocrystal
structure. On the other hand, crystal contacts may stabilize covalent-orlistat
in conformation I as demonstrated by our simulation when crystal packing
from another chain exists. This result further demonstrates that the
two conformations of covalent-orlistat are equivalent and the final
adopted conformation is susceptible to the surrounding environments
from the protein. Taking both the experimental and computational observations
into account, it is tempting to speculate that the conformational
transition of the hexyl tail may be a rate-limiting step of orlistat
hydrolysis.

We also showed that a hydrogen bond exists between
the catalytic
His2481 residue and covalent-orlistat, which may inhibit
orlistat hydrolysis. It appears that in conformation I, the strong
interaction between the catalytic nitrogen atom of His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety of covalent-orlistat greatly prevents water
molecules from hydrogen bonding with the same atom of His2481 and from adopting the proper orientation for activation and catalysis.
When the hexyl tail transits from conformation I to II, the hydrogen
bond between His2481 and covalent-orlistat is disrupted,
which frees and enables His2481 to hydrogen bond with and
activate water molecules to attack the carbonyl carbon of the orlistat-Ser2308 residue. In the cocrystal structure, the distance between
the catalytic nitrogen atom of His2481 and the hydroxyl
moiety of covalent-orlistat is 3.9 Å in conformation I, representing
a weak hydrogen bond between the two atoms. In agreement with our
simulation, this distance increased to 5.4 Å in conformation
II in the cocrystal structure. Although a distance of 3.9 Å in
conformation I indicates a weak hydrogen bond, it should be considered
that the crystal structure is a still snapshot of a protein in solid
state, which may not capture the stronger hydrogen bonding event found
in solution. Nevertheless, both the crystal structure and our simulation
data suggest stronger interactions between the catalytic nitrogen
atom of His2481 and the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group
of covalent-orlistat in conformation I than in conformation II.

So we may conclude that the hexyl tail in conformation I favors
a stronger interaction between the catalytic nitrogen atom of His2481 and the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group of covalent-orlistat,
which prohibits hydrolysis. This is further validated by the simulation
of TE covalently bound to a truncated orlistat lacking the long hexyl
tail. The simulation shows that the hydrogen bond between His2481 and the hydroxyl moiety of truncated covalent-orlistat
is quickly and spontaneously disrupted, accompanied by an increase
in activated water molecules in the active site for hydrolysis. Thus,
the truncated orlistat may be more easily hydrolyzed than the intact
orlistat. These results are intuitive in that truncated orlistat is
structurally more closely related to the natural substrates of FASN
TE. Interestingly, it has been found previously that ebelactone B,
a β-lactone compound containing an ethyl group in the same position
as the hexyl tail of orlistat, was more effective in inhibiting FASN
TE activity than ebelactone A, which contains a methyl group,8 leading to the speculation that this moiety may
be important for stabilizing the covalent bound ligand in the TE active
site and protecting it from hydrolysis.29 Our data supports this hypothesis and provides a mechanistic model
by demonstrating that the hexyl tail in conformation I is needed to
stabilize the hydrogen bond that forms between His2481 and
the hydroxyl moiety of orlistat, which helps to prevent hydrolysis
of the ligand. This stabilization is lost when the hexyl tail is removed,
or undergoes conformation transition, likely leading to rapid hydrolysis
shortly thereafter. Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of FASN, although
the conversion rate can be very slow. Considering that FASN overexpression
may cause an increased metastatic potential, poorer prognosis, and
resistance toward cancer chemotherapeutics in a wide variety of human
cancers,2,3 information from this study may help in
the rational design of more potent irreversible TE inhibitors for
anticancer treatment. By utilizing and stabilizing the hydrogen bond
between the ligand and His2481 and thereby inhibiting the
activation of a water molecule for catalysis, it would be possible
to design or discover inhibitors that covalently bond to TE and permanently
disable its function. Another strategy for next generation compound
design may be to use moieties that block the space in the active site
near His2481 that water molecules must occupy for activation.
This may be achievable, as it has previously been shown in a similar
case of inhibitors of E. coli TEM-1
β-lactamase. Although β-lactamases have a different catalytic
triad from that of TE, they contain an active site Ser. Inhibitors
of β-lactamase, such as penicillanic acid, inhibit the enzyme
by acetylation of this active site Ser.30 A modified form of penicillanic acid, 6α-(hydroxymethyl) penicillanate,
created by incorporating a hydroxymethyl moiety designed to displace
the catalytic water molecule in the active site, resulted in a retarded
rate of hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.31 The mechanism of action was later confirmed by X-ray crystallography.31
