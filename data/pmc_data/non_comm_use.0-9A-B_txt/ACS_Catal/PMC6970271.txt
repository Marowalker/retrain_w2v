PHF8 (KDM7B) is a human non-heme 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)
JmjC domain
oxygenase that catalyzes the demethylation of the di/mono-Nε-methylated K9 residue of histone H3. Altered PHF8 activity is linked
to genetic diseases and cancer; thus, it is an interesting target
for epigenetic modulation. We describe the use of combined quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations to explore the mechanism of PHF8, including dioxygen activation,
2OG binding modes, and substrate demethylation steps. A PHF8 crystal
structure manifests the 2OG C-1 carboxylate bound to iron in a nonproductive
orientation, i.e., trans to His247. A ferryl–oxo
intermediate formed by activating dioxygen bound to the vacant site
in this complex would be nonproductive, i.e., “off-line”
with respect to reaction with Nε-methylated K9. We
show rearrangement of the “off-line” ferryl–oxo
intermediate to a productive “in-line” geometry via
a solvent exchange reaction (called “ferryl-flip”) is
energetically unfavorable. The calculations imply that movement of
the 2OG C-1 carboxylate prior to dioxygen binding at a five-coordination
stage in catalysis proceeds with a low barrier, suggesting that two
possible 2OG C-1 carboxylate geometries can coexist at room temperature.
We explored alternative mechanisms for hydrogen atom transfer and
show that second sphere interactions orient the Nε-methylated lysine in a conformation where hydrogen abstraction from
a methyl C–H bond is energetically more favorable than hydrogen
abstraction from the N–H bond of the protonated Nε-methyl group. Using multiple HAT reaction path calculations, we
demonstrate the crucial role of conformational flexibility in effective
hydrogen transfer. Subsequent hydroxylation occurs through a rebound
mechanism, which is energetically preferred compared to desaturation,
due to second sphere interactions. The overall mechanistic insights
reveal the crucial role of iron-center rearrangement, second sphere
interactions, and conformational flexibility in PHF8 catalysis and
provide knowledge useful for the design of mechanism-based PHF8 inhibitors.

1 Introduction
Genetic information in
eukaryotic cells is stored in chromatin,
which packs DNA and histone proteins in an organized and compact structure.1 The basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome,
is usually built from a histone octamer containing two copies each
of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones, around which about two turns of
DNA are wrapped to form an octamer.1 Unstructured
N-terminal histone tails extend from the nucleosome and undergo post-translational
modifications (PTMs), including methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation.2,3 PTMs of histones affect chromatin structure and function with consequences
for compaction, transcription, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair.2,3 Histone N-methylation occurs on arginine- and lysine-residues
and affects a wide range of biological processes. Misregulation of N-methylation is linked with diseases including cancer.4−6 Histone lysines can be mono-, di- and trimethylated (me1, me2, and
me3);7 changes in methylation status do
not significantly change the charge on the Nε-nitrogen.
Depending on its position, lysine Nε-methylation
can be either transcriptionally repressing or activating, e.g., methylation
of K9 or K27 of histone H3 can activate transcription, whereas methylation
of K4 and K36 of the same histone protein can repress transcription.8 Histone methylation was once widely thought to
be irreversible, but this view was reversed by the relatively recent
identification of histone demethylases (KDMs).9,10

There are two families of histone KDMs: (i) the flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent enzymes (KDM1s) and (ii) the Jumonji
C (JmjC) domain-containing enzymes (KDM2-7 subfamilies in humans).
The JmjC proteins are Fe (II) and 2-oxoglutarate- (2OG-) dependent
dioxygenases that couple substrate oxidation to decarboxylation of
2OG to form succinate, CO2, and a ferryl–oxo intermediate
(Scheme 1). The latter
performs hydrogen abstraction from the substrate, followed by hydroxylation
and nonenzymatic formation of formaldehyde.11,12 The catalytic JmjC domain has a conserved distorted double-stranded
β-helix (DSBH) fold, which has a funnel-like structure formed
from conserved antiparallel β-sheets and additional elements,
where one end of DSBH harbors the active site including the iron center.13 The 2OG cosubstrate chelates to Fe(II) via its
C1 carboxylate and C2 keto groups.11,12 Three conserved
protein residues (His1-X-Asp/Glu-X-His2 triad),
present in most 2OG oxygenases, bind to one face of the octahedrally
coordinated metal ion. Most characterized 2OG oxygenases employ a
conserved mechanism involving sequential binding of 2OG, substrate,
then O2.11,12,14,15 2OG oxygenases play vital roles in the industrial
fermentation of vitally important drugs, such as the penicillins and
cephalosporins, and drug precursors.8a Their
engineering to directly ferment commercially useful products is of
interest.8a Hence, there is considerable
interest in understanding their mechanisms from a biocatalytic perspective.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Catalytic Cycle of 2OG Oxygenases Involving
either a Ferryl-Flip after the Formation of the “Off-Line”
Ferryl–Oxo Intermediate (Path 1) or a Change in the 2OG C-1
Carboxylate Binding Mode from “Off-Line” to “In-Line”
Prior to O2 Binding (Path 2)
PHF8 (KDM7B) catalyzes the demethylation of
the dimethylated or
monomethylated lysine 9 residue in histone H3 (H3K9me2/me1), in a
manner actively promoted by binding of its N-terminal plant homeodomain
(PHD) to H3K4me3.16,17 The PHF8 gene is overexpressed
in many cancers including prostate cancer,18,19 breast cancer,20 laryngeal cancer,21 hypopharyngeal cancer,21 nonsmall cell lung cancer,22 and esophageal
cancer.23 Cancer cells in which PHF8 is
depleted manifest reduced cell growth19,19,22,23 and migration18,23 and increased apoptosis.18,19,22 Substitution of phenylalanine 279 to serine in PHF8 (F279S) is linked
with X-linked mental retardation.24−27 Thus, PHF8 is a current medicinal
chemistry target. Crystallographic analysis of PHF8 in complex with
a H3K4me3K9me2 fragment16,17 informs on interactions
between the substrate and the JmjC and PHD domains. A PHD-JmjC linker
is responsible for the productive orientation of the JmjC domain to
bind H3K9me2/me1 productively, as shown by experimental and computational
studies.17,28

Similarly to other 2OG dependent hydroxylases,11,12 the proposed reaction mechanism for JmjC KDMs involves binding of
O2 to Fe(II).2OG.substrate complex.11,12 The subsequently formed ferric–superoxo radical complex (Fe(III)-OO.–) reacts with C2 of 2OG, leading to decarboxylation
and formation of succinate and the ferryl–oxo (Fe(IV)=O)
species (Scheme 1).
The reactive ferryl–oxo complex formed can then abstract a
hydrogen atom from the lysine Nε-methyl group and form a ferric–hydroxyl species which performs
rebound hydroxylation to form a hemiaminal,11,12 which, at least in studied cases, rapidly fragments to give formaldehyde
and the demethylated lysine-residue.11,12,29

Depending on the particular protein environment
in 2OG oxygenases,
the 2OG C1 carboxylate can adopt two different active site Fe-coordination
modes.12 In one mode, the 2OG C1 carboxylate
ligates trans to His1, leaving the position trans to His2 for O2 binding (water
may need to be displaced). Binding of O2 in this “in-line”
mode would lead to the reactive ferryl–oxo intermediate being
adjacent to the substrate C–H bond (Scheme 1).12,30 Evidence for this binding
mode comes from crystallographic studies on clavaminate synthase (CAS),30 taurine dioxygenase (TauD),31 factor inhibiting hypoxia (FIH),32 and other 2OG oxygenases. In the second, “off-line”
mode, the 2OG C1 carboxylate binds trans to His2, leaving the position trans to His1 for O2 binding, which is approximately perpendicular
to the substrate, as observed in crystallographic studies on carbapenem
synthase (CarC),33 anthocyanidin synthase
(ANS),34 alkylated base repair protein
(AlkB),35 and some other 2OG oxygenases.
Thus, based on the coordination position of the 2OG C1 carboxylate,
two possible pathways consistent with crystallographic and kinetic
studies have been proposed for the formation of the ferryl–oxo
complex30 (Scheme 1): (i) The 2OG C1 carboxylate binds trans to His2 in “off-line” binding
mode leading to O2 binding trans to His1. In order for the “off-line” mode to produce
a catalytically productive ferryl–oxo intermediate, it has
been proposed that in some cases the initially formed ferryl intermediate
may “flip”, potentially via oxygen atom exchange with
a solvent water molecule, to a position adjacent to the substrate
(path 1, Scheme 1).30 Experimental and computational studies for a
ferryl-flip via oxygen atom exchange using a water molecule have been
reported for natural as well as synthetic non-heme iron enzymes.36−40 A ferryl-flip mechanism involving hydration is also consistent with
the less than stoichiometric incorporation of an oxygen atom from
dioxygen into hydroxylated products in the case of some, but not all,
2OG dependent hydroxylases (by contrast there are consistently high
levels of incorporation of single oxygen from dioxygen into succinate).41 (ii) Alternatively, in the presence of substrate
when the water molecule from the Fe-center is displaced, for O2 binding, the 2OG C1 carboxylate can rearrange to the position trans to His1 and O2 binds in the
position trans to His2. As the O2 binding and subsequent ferryl–oxo intermediate forming are trans to His2, i.e., “in-line”
geometry, no ferryl-flip is required, and the mechanism is simpler.30 Consistent with the second mechanism, both “in-line”
and “off-line” binding modes have been observed for
PHF8. A PHF81–447.Fe(II)·H31–14K4me3K9me2·NOG (NOG, N-oxalylglcyine is a close
2OG analog) crystal structure manifests the NOG C1 carboxylate trans to His2 (His247), i.e. in an “off-line”
binding mode,17 while a PHF886–447.Fe.2OG crystal structure shows the 2OG C1 carboxylate trans to His1 (His319), i.e., in an “in-line”
binding mode.42 Also, a crystal structure
of PHF8 with a Fe-chelating inhibitor daminozide shows an “in-line”
binding mode.43

Despite the biophysical
insights on PHF8, there is a lack of knowledge
on its demethylation mechanism, including with respect to the effects
of conformational dynamics on catalysis and the different possible
binding modes of 2OG. Alternative mechanistic proposals for the hydrogen
abstraction step (HAT), which is often rate-limiting in 2OG oxygenase
catalysis, have been proposed based on model compounds;44 however, these have not been tested within a
protein environment. While the 2OG iron-O2 derived intermediates
(e.g., a superoxo complex) has not been trapped so far, studies with
other iron–oxygen intermediates indicate they might have a
sufficiently long lifetime to cause conformational changes in proteins.
The enzyme ferric–superoxo intermediate has been characterized
by crystallographic studies with both non-heme45 and heme enzymes, suggesting it has a sufficiently long
lifetime to enable conformational changes.46 The mean lifetime of a ferryl–oxo intermediate has been measured
to be 2.1 s in another 2OG dependent oxygenase, TauD,47 hence, it is viable to propose it might cause potential
conformational changes in the protein. To explore such conformational
changes, we performed 1 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of PHF8 ferric–superoxo and ferryl–oxo intermediates
in PHF8 followed by QM/MM reaction path calculations. The results
provide insight into the effects of different 2OG binding modes and
the role of the protein environment in promoting demethylation performed
by PHF8.

2 Methods
System Preparation
A crystal structure of the PHF81–447 in complex with H31–14 (Lys4-trimethylated
(H3K4me3) and Lys9-dimethylated (H3K9me2)) and the 2OG analog N-oxalylglycine was used for modeling (PDB ID: 3KV4).17 Missing residues (1–2, 65–77, including the
linker region between the PHD and the JmjC domains) were modeled using
Modeler.48 The crystal structure manifests
Fe-center in “off-line” mode bidentate coordination
with 2OG (Scheme 1),
and monodentate coordination with two histidines, one aspartic acid,
and one water molecule.17 To generate parameters
for (a) the ferric–superoxo complex, the water molecule coordinated
to Fe in the crystal structure (PDB ID: 3KV4) was replaced with O2 using
GaussView 5.0.49 The 2OG analog N-oxalylglycine was modeled to 2OG by replacing its NH with
a methylene group using GaussView 5.0.49 Hydrogen atoms were added to 2OG using the leap module of AMBER
16.50 The protonation states of ionizable
side chains of the proteins were assessed using Amber routines.51 The Amber topology for 2OG, Lys4-trimethylated
(H3K4me3), and Lys9-demethylated (H3K9me2) were developed using the
GAFF tool in Antechamber.52 The Amber parameters
for the Fe–superoxo complex active site containing iron (Fe(III)
high spin (HS) S = 2, M = 5) and
the coordinating ligands (2OG, bidentate; O2, bonded in
end-on fashion; H247, H319, and D249, all monodentate) were prepared
using the Metal Centre Parameter Builder (MCPB) using MCPB.py v3.0.53 Bond and angle force constants were derived
using the Seminario method, and the point charge parameters for the
electrostatic potentials were obtained by RESP charge fitting using
the ChgModB method at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The description
of the zinc ion and its coordinating ligands in the PHD domain were
described using the Zinc Amber force field (ZAFF) method.54 The remainder of the protein was modeled using
the Amber FF14SB force field.55

The
same procedure was used to generate parameters for (b) the ferryl–oxo
complex with H31–14K4me3K9me2 histone substrate
and succinate. Spectroscopic studies of another 2OG oxygenase (SyrB2)
implies the ferryl–oxo intermediate is a five-coordinate complex;56 thus, the ferryl–oxo complex of PHF8
(Fe(IV)=O high spin S = 2, M = 5) was modeled to be five-coordinate with monodentate succinate,
two histidines (H247 and H319), and an aspartate (D249). Previous
molecular dynamics simulations run using these parameter generation
procedures have successfully reproduced the geometry of non-heme Fe
complexes.28,57

MD Simulations
The Leap module in AMBER 16 was used
to add counterions (Na+) for the neutralization of the
protein systems. The system was immersed into a rectangular box with
TIP3Pwater58 molecules present up to a
minimum of 10 Å from the farthest protein boundary. Periodic
boundary conditions were employed in all simulations. Long-range electrostatic
interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method59 with a direct space and vdW cutoff of 10 Å.

With a restraint of 100 kcal mol–1 Å2 on solute molecules, the systems were subjected to energy
minimization first using the steepest descent (5000 steps) followed
by the conjugate gradient (5000 steps). This was followed by the full
minimization of the entire system with both steepest descent (5000
steps) and a conjugate gradient (5000 steps) to relax the system.
The systems were then subjected to controlled heating from 0 to 300
K at constant volume using Langevin thermostat60 with a collision frequency of 1 ps–1 using
a canonical ensemble (NVT) MD simulation for 250
ps. The solute molecules were restrained using a harmonic potential
of 50 kcal mol–1 Å2 during the heating
process. The SHAKE algorithm61 was used
to constrain bonds involving hydrogen. For ferryl–oxo, an initial
MD was performed with harmonic restraint between substrate H3K9me2
and the ferryl–oxo for 50 ns. All systems were then equilibrated
at 300 K in an NPT ensemble without restraints for
50 ns; the pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat.62 A production MD run from equilibrated structures
with explicit solvent for 1 μs each with a time step of 2 fs
was performed in NPT ensemble with a target pressure
set at 1 bar and constant pressure coupling of 2 ps. All productive
MD simulations were performed with the GPU version of the AMBER 16
package.50 Hydrogen bond analysis was done
using CPPTRAJ63 with a cutoff of 3 Å
between donor to the acceptor and 135° angle between donor-hydrogen-acceptor
unless otherwise mentioned. The binding energy values were calculated
using MMGBSA method64 by taking 10000 frames
in account from the respective 1 μs MD simulation. Dynamic cross
correlation analysis (DCCA) and principal component analysis (PCA)
was performed on C-α atoms of PHF8 using trajectory from 500
to 1000 ns with Bio3D.65

QM/MM Calculations
Equilibrated structures with productive
distance (e.g., distal oxygen and C2 atom of 2OG for O2 activation) and an angle (e.g., ∠ Fe–O–H for
hydrogen atom transfer) were taken from MD simulations and used for
the QM/MM calculations. Excess water molecules were truncated using
CPPTRAJ,63 such that protein has a water
solvation layer of a maximum 12 Å surrounding it. The resulting
total size of the systems was ∼30000 atoms. QM/MM calculations
were performed using ChemShell software,66 with a combination of Turbomole67 for
the QM part and DL_POLY68 for the MM part.
The non-heme Fe center, the first coordinating sphere residues, and
substrate-bound in the active site were included in the QM region
(Figure 1). An unrestricted
B3LYP functional was used to represent the QM region as it has been
used for several non-heme69 and 2OG-enzymes
with better accuracy in comparison to other functionals for calculation
for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) barrier.39,70−73 The protein region within 8 Å from the QM region was defined
as the MM region, and the rest of the system was fixed. The Amber
FF14SB force field was used for the MM region. QM/MM boundaries were
treated with hydrogen link atom with a charge shift model.74 The polarizing effect of the protein environment
(MM region) was accounted on the QM region using an electrostatic
embedding scheme.75 For geometry optimization
and frequency calculations, the def2-SVP basis set [QM(B1)/MM] was
used.76

Figure 1 PHF8 ferric–superoxo intermediate
with the H31–14K4me3K9me2 substrate bound at the
active site. The QM region used
for PHF8 QM/MM calculations is shown in ball and stick format. Note
that the 2OG C1 carboxylate is in an “off-line” position
in this view (Scheme 1).

Optimized reactant complexes (RC)
were used to search
for transition states (TS) along with the reaction coordinate
by performing a relaxed potential energy scan (adiabatic mapping)77 with a step size of 0.1 Å. The highest
energy geometry in this potential energy surface (PES) was optimized
using the P-RFO optimizer in HDLC code without any constraints.78 Frequency calculations of all optimized geometries
were carried out to confirm the minima and transitions states. To
improve calculated energies, single-point energy calculations on the
optimized geometry were done using the large all-electron def2-TZVP
basis set [QM(B2)/MM].76 The zero-point
energy (ZPE) calculations were performed for all geometries, and the
energies are reported as QM(B2+ZPE)/MM. The D3 Grimme’s dispersion
correction79 is applied in single-point
calculations, and energies are reported as B2+D3+ZPE in the Supporting Information. Experimental studies
have shown the quintet spin state (S = 2) as a ground
spin state for studied non-heme enzymes.80−82 Several computational
studies on O2 activation and HAT pathway in non-heme 2OG
dependent enzymes have shown the reaction proceeds through a HS quintet
spin state.39,69−72,83,84 Therefore, we performed reaction mechanism
calculation on the quintet (S = 2, M = 5) spin state of PHF8 ferric–superoxo and ferryl–oxo
complex. The geometries, spin densities, charges, and dispersion corrected
energies of all intermediates and transition states are presented
in Supporting Information.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Conformational Flexibility of the Fe(III)–Superoxo
Complex
Enzymes are flexible structures that typically exhibit
a wide variety of internal motions ranging from femtoseconds to hours,85,86 some of which might be relevant to catalysis.87 Structural studies imply the ferric–superoxo intermediates
in non-heme45 and heme46 oxygenase catalysis may have sufficiently long lifetimes
to enable conformational changes. To investigate whether conformational
changes are associated with O2 binding in PHF8 and to obtain
equilibrated structures for QM/MM calculations, we performed 1 μs
MD simulations of the PHF8·Fe(III)–OO.–·2OG(off-line).H31–14 substrate (subsequently
referred to as the PHF8–ferric–superoxo complex). The
MD simulations show a well equilibrated PHF8–ferric–superoxo
complex with an average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 1.97
Å for PHF8 C-α atoms with respect to the minimized crystal
structure (Figure S1).17 Hydrogen bonds with protein residues and the solvent stabilize
2OG binding, the conformation of the substrate, and the orientation
of the Fe-coordinated ligands (Figure S4). The non-Fe coordinating 2OG C5 carboxylate is stabilized by stable
hydrogen bonding with Y257 (present in 80% of MD snapshots) and K264
(78%). T253 is positioned to make a hydrogen bond (82%) with the backbone
oxygen of the iron-coordinating aspartic acid (D249). The Fe-coordinating
histidines (H247 and H319) form hydrogen bonds with each other (72%)
and with D245 (76%) and W317 (15%), respectively.

Enzymes can
exhibit complex correlated motions; dynamic cross correlation analysis
(DCCA) can be applied to explore correlated motions in protein dynamics,
while principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to analyze motions
in flexible regions of proteins.88,89 The PHF8–ferric–superoxo
complex shows little correlation between motions of the linker and
PHD domain with other parts of protein unlike in the PHF8·2OG·H31–14 substrate (enzyme–substrate) complex,28 suggesting the significant impact of the dioxygen
binding on the network of correlated motions (Figure S5). In comparison with PHF8 enzyme–substrate
complex dynamics (Scheme 1),28 correlated motions are increased
in the α9 regions of the JmjC domain in the PHF8–ferric–superoxo
complex. The increased motions in the α9 regions of PHF8 are
not manifest in the PHF8 enzyme–substrate complex dynamics28 and hence appear related to O2 binding.
Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that the α9 regions
move toward the active site, apparently preparing the complex for
catalysis (Figure S6).

3.2 O2 Activation Mechanism from “Off-Line”
and “In-Line” 2OG Binding Modes
The reaction
mechanism for the oxygen activation mechanism in PHF8.Fe(III)-OO.–.2OG.H31–14 substrate starting from
both “off-line” RC1, or “in-line” RC1′ binding mode of 2OG was studied using QM/MM calculations.
The intermediates and transition states obtained for both the “in-line”
and “off-line” 2OG binding mode in PHF8 are similar
to those identified for other 2OG dependent enzymes (Figures S7–S13).39,69−72,83,90−92 The mechanism proceeds via attack of the distal oxygen
(Od) onto C2 of 2OG, leading to a loss of CO2 to form a
decarboxylated succinyl-peroxide intermediate IM1/IM1′, which has been recently characterized crystallographically for
a 2OG dependent enzyme VioC.90 The energy
barrier for decarboxylation, which is the rate-determining step in
the O2 activation process, is 12.7 and 10.2 kcal/mol at
the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory for “off-line” and
“in-line” modes of 2OG, and slightly favors “in-line”
binding of 2OG for O2 activation (Figure S7 - S8). These energy barriers compare reasonably well to
experimental kinetic data on TauD, a similar 2OG dependent enzyme
(15.2 kcal/mol, calculated from rate constant value of 42 s–1)93 and computational studies on other
2OG oxygenases.70−72 The succinyl-peroxide IM1/IM1′ then undergoes homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond to generate
a ferryl–oxo intermediate IM3/IM3′. The
ferryl–oxo formed from “off-line” binding mode
of 2OG IM3 has the oxo group trans to
His247, i.e., away from the substrate (Figure S7) while the ferryl–oxo formed from “in-line”
binding mode of 2OG IM3′ has the oxo group trans to His319, i.e. close to substrate (Figure S13). The geometries and spin densities of all intermediates
and transition state in the O2 activation mechanism are
shown in Supporting Information (Table S1 and S7) and are consistent with computational studies on similar
2OG enzymes.39,69−72,83,90

3.3 The Ferryl-Flip Mechanism via Solvent Oxygen
Atom Exchange
The “off-line” ferryl–oxo
intermediate (IM3) generated after O2 activation
has to be oriented in the direction of the substrate for productive
catalysis, i.e., adopt an “in-line” geometry. One possible
mechanism for such reorientation is via oxygen atom exchange with
a water molecule (Figure 2A).12,30 This process could begin by binding
of a water molecule to the open coordination site of the Fe-center
at the IM3 intermediate stage (Figure 2B). The so formed intermediate (IM4) is a six-coordinate “off-line” ferryl–oxo
with a water molecule facing in the direction of the substrate (Figure 2C). The bond length
between Fe and the oxygen of water (Ow) is 2.11 Å; the Fe-Op
bond distance is the same as in IM3 (i.e., 1.62 Å)
and agrees well with another computational study of oxygen atom exchange
in a 2OG oxygenase (AsqJ).39 The proton
(Hw) of the Fe coordinated water is transferred to the succinate oxygen
(Os label on Figure 2A/2C) to form an intermediate (IM5) with a low barrier
of 2.6 kcal/mol at QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory via a transition
state (TS3). IM5 then rearranges to give
the ferryl-dihydroxyl species IM6 with a very low energy
barrier (of 1.9 at B2 and −0.2 kcal/mol at QM(B2+ZPE)/MM).
In IM6, the Fe–Op and Fe–Ow bond distances
are 1.73 and 1.79 Å, respectively, which compares well with a
computational study on AsqJ.39 To complete
the ferryl-flip, the second proton of the ligating water molecule
(Hx) is transferred to Op via a proton-relay transfer with the help
of a nearby water molecule. The second proton transfer proceeds with
a transition state (TS5), which is 16.6 kcal/mol higher
in energy than the previous intermediate at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level
of theory. The intermediate (IM7) formed is the flipped
six-coordinated “in-line” complex. This intermediate
(IM7) can then release a water molecule and give a final
flipped “in-line” 5-coordinate ferryl–oxo complex
(IM8). Although the flipped 5-coordinate complex (IM8) is slightly higher in energy (by 3.2 kcal/mol) than the
6-coordinate “in-line” ferryl–oxo, modeling studies
show that ferryl–oxo species can be either five- or six-coordinate;94−96 spectroscopic studies with another 2OG oxygenase (SyrB2) imply the
ferryl–oxo is five-coordinate.56 The total barrier for the ferryl-flip via oxygen atom exchange is
calculated to be 18.1 kcal/mol at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory,
which is higher than a previously reported barrier of 10.9 kcal/mol
for the 2OG oxygenase Asqj.39 The higher
reaction barrier for the ferryl-flip in the case of PHF8 might be
due to its more compact active site,17,44 and the steric
hindrance between the water molecule needed for proton-relay in TS5 and the methyl groups of the substrate, which is not the
case in AsqJ. Since the total barrier for the ferryl-flip is relatively
high in PHF8, it may not be an energetically favored pathway for formation
of the “in-line” ferryl–oxo intermediate, but
it cannot be completely excluded as the barrier is still less than

constant of 5.4 h–1) for the hydrogen abstraction
step of PHF8, which is believed to be the rate-determining step in
the entire reaction mechanism of PHF8.17

3.4 2OG Rearrangement before O2 Binding
To explore the change in the binding mode of 2OG from “off-line”
to “in-line” in PHF8, we calculated a potential energy
surface by changing the dihedral angle for Nε (nitrogen
of His1)–Fe–O2–O1. We first optimized
the five-coordinate PHF8 enzyme–substrate complex at the QM/MM
level. The five-coordinate PHF8 enzyme–substrate complex (ES1) has iron in the Fe(II) high spin S =
2, M = 5 state, with the 2OG bound in an “off-line”
bidentate fashion, and two histidines (H247 and H319) and an aspartate
(D249) bound in monodentate fashion along with the H31–14K4me3K9me2 substrate. The bond lengths of iron and the two coordinating
oxygens of 2OG (Fe–O1 and Fe–O2) are increased from
1.97 and 2.31 Å in RC1 to 2.03 and 2.48 Å,
respectively, in ES1 (Figure 3). The dihedral angle for Nε (nitrogen of His1)–Fe–O2–O1 also
changes from 100° in RC1 to 127° in ES1. The potential energy surface was calculated starting from ES1, using a reaction coordinate of the dihedral angle Nε (nitrogen of His1)–Fe–O2–O1
to give the “in-line” five-coordinate enzyme–substrate
complex ES1′ (Figure 3). The dihedral rotation which leads to the
“in-line” five-coordinate PHF8 enzyme–substrate
complex (ES1′) proceeds with a low barrier of
1.48 kcal/mol (at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory) principally because
there are no protein residues interacting with the C1 carboxylate
of 2OG in ES1. The transition state (ES2) has a dihedral angle of 144° for Nε (nitrogen
of His1)–Fe–O2–O1, and bond lengths
between iron and the two coordinating oxygens of 2OG (Fe–O1
and Fe–O2) of 2.02 and 2.52 Å, respectively. The “in-line”
five-coordinate PHF8 enzyme–substrate complex (ES1′) has a relative energy of −0.98 kcal/mol with respect to ES1 at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory. The dihedral angle
for N(nitrogen of His1)–Fe–O2–O1 in ES1′ increases to 149°, with bond lengths between
iron and the two coordinating oxygens of 2OG (Fe–O1 and Fe–O2)
of 2.0 and 2.6 Å, respectively.

a change in the binding
mode of 2OG from “off-line” in ES1 to “in-line”
in ES1′. Angles and bond lengths are in degrees
and angstroms, respectively.

Thus, the change from “off-line”
to “in-line”
coordination mode of 2OG in PHF8 proceeds with a relatively low barrier,
suggesting both possible 2OG C1 carboxylate geometries might coexist
at room temperature. Consistent with the result of a change in the
binding mode of 2OG in PHF8, the CAS.Fe(II).2OG.substrate.NO crystal
structure (NO is used as an analog for O2) shows a changed
binding mode in the 2OG C1 carboxylate geometry upon NO binding in
comparison to the CAS·Fe(II)·2OG.substrate crystal structure.30 Crystal structures of KDM2A·Ni·H3K36me1–3·2OG/NOG
(Ni and NOG are used as analogs for Fe and 2OG, respectively) show
evidence for both “in-line” and “off-line”
binding modes of the 2OG/NOG C1 carboxylate, but the KDM2A.Fe.H3K36me1.succinate.NO
structure (note the 2OG in the crystal structure was reported to be
oxidized to succinate even though the H3K36 substrate remained methylated)
was refined to show only the “in-line” binding mode;
i.e., NO was bound trans to His2.97

3.5 Conformational Dynamics and Substrate Stabilization
in PHF8 Fe(IV)=O Intermediate
The ferryl–oxo
species is a key intermediate in 2OG oxygenase catalysis that performs
hydrogen abstraction from the substrate. This process might be sensitive
to the dynamic orientation between the substrate and the iron, which
is likely controlled by conformational changes.98−100 The mean lifetime
of a ferryl–oxo intermediate has been measured to be 2.1 s
for the 2OG dependent TauD,47 and hence
appears stable enough to enable potential conformational changes.
To explore this possibility, we performed 1 μs MD simulations
of the PHF8-ferryl–oxo-inline complex (IM8) with
succinate and the H31–14K4me3K9me2histone substrate.
The MD simulations indicate a well equilibrated PHF8-ferryl–oxo-inline
complex with an average root mean squared deviation of 2.03 Å
for C-α atoms of the protein from the QM/MM optimized starting
structure IM8 (Figure S15).
The protein stabilizes the H3K9me2 substrate and the iron center via
multiple hydrogen bonds (Figure S18). The
noncoordinating (C4) carboxyl group of succinate is stabilized by
hydrogen bonding interactions with Y257 (83%), N189 (61%), K264 (60%),
and T244 (41%), and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds with the iron-ligated
D249 (50%) and T253 (52%). The H3K9me2 is supported by hydrogen bonding
with F250 (72%), R460 (70%), and a steric interaction with I191. T253
(75%) and G252 (12%) make hydrogen bonds to support the backbone oxygen
of the Fe-coordinating D249, while the noncoordinating oxygen of the
D249 carboxyl group makes a strong interaction with N333. The coordinating
histidines (H247, H319) form a hydrogen bond with each other (89%)
and with residues D245 (70%) and W317 (28%), respectively.

After
300 ns, the H3K9me2 substrate equilibrates to a conformation wherein
one of the substrate methyl groups is closest to the ferryl–oxo
unit, followed by another methyl group and hydrogen of NH (Figure 4). These observations
suggest that the first hydrogen abstraction happens from the methyl
group of the substrate. Similarly to observations with the PHF8–ferric–superoxo
MD simulations, the PHD domain and the linker show reduced correlated
motions, which could provide a stable enzyme conformation for catalysis
(Figure S19). The motions in α9-α12
are increased in comparison with the PHF8–ferric–superoxo
MD and show motion in the direction of the active site, thus further
compressing the overall PHF8 conformation (Figure S20). Such conformational changes will improve binding between
PHF8 and the substrate, as seen in the calculated binding energies
of the PHF8·Fe(IV)·oxo·succinate·H31–14K4me3K9me2 complex (−139.0 kcal/mol) and PHF8·Fe(III)·superoxo·2OG.H31–14K4me3K9me2 complex (−80.6 kcal/mol).

group (blue), and hydrogen of the amino group (red) of H3K9me2 substrate
in the dynamics of PHF8-ferryl–oxo-inline complex.

3.6 Hydrogen Atom Abstraction (HAT) Takes Place
from C–H Rather Than N–H
It is generally accepted
that in non-heme enzyme catalyzed demethylation, the oxygen atom of
the Fe(IV)=O species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the methyl
group of the substrate to form a Fe(III)–OH group and a substrate-based
radical.11,12 For PHF8, since the H3K9 substrate is dimethylated,
the Fe(IV)=O could also (potentially) attack a hydrogen atom
on the N atom of H3K9me2 substrate. It has further been proposed that
hydrogen atom abstraction can occur either from the methyl group or
from the NH group, depending on the orientation of H3K9me2 with respect
to the Fe–O bond (Figure 5A).44 When the hydrogen
atom of the NH group of the substrate points away from the iron-center,
it is denoted as an “H-out” conformation (shown as reactant RC2 in Figure 5C), and if the hydrogen atom of the NH group points toward the iron-center,
it has been denoted as an “H-in” conformation (shown
as reactant RC3 in Figure 5C). Previous QM calculations on non-heme models of
methylated lysine have indicated that for the dimethylated substrate,
hydrogen abstraction from a methyl group and NH group are both feasible.44 The MD simulations of the ferryl–oxo
complex in PHF8 show the NH group in the “H-out” conformation,
which makes NH abstraction less energetically favorable than C–H
abstraction (Figure 4). To verify further the MD prediction of the ferryl–oxo PHF8
structure, we carried out a QM/MM potential energy surface for both
C–H and N–H abstraction steps.

Figure 5 (A) Possible first hydrogen
abstraction pathways from CH (RC3-TS6-IM9) and NH (RC4-TS7-IM10). (B) Potential energy surface

level of theory. (C) QM active site geometries of transition states
and selected intermediates in the hydrogen atom transfer mechanism

Two snapshots from PHF8–ferryl–oxo
MD were chosen
for QM/MM analysis, one snapshot with the “H-out” conformation
which is apparently favorable for C–H abstraction (RC2), and another snapshot with “H-in” conformation, which
is apparently favorable for N–H abstraction (RC3) (Figure 5C). The
starting MD snapshots of reactants, RC2 and RC3, have the ferryl–oxo at distances of 2.3 and 2.6 Å from
the hydrogen atom of carbon and nitrogen (O–HC/O–HN),
respectively; the Fe–O–HC/Fe–O–HN angles
are 163° and 139°, respectively. QM/MM optimization of both
snapshots changes the O–HC/O–NH distances to 2.2/3.1
Å and Fe–O–HC/Fe–O–HN angles to 167°/149°,
respectively, for RC2/RC3. The potential
energy surfaces for hydrogen atom transfer from RC2 and RC3 are shown in Figure 5B. The activation barriers of the two HAT reactions
with RC2 and RC3 are 17.6 and 23.5 kcal/mol,
respectively, at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory, suggesting that
HAT involving C–H abstraction is the more energetically preferable
reaction. The D3 dispersion corrected energies also reproduce the
same trend and are shown in Supporting Information with spin densities (Table S9). The QM/MM
calculations support the proposal of unfavorable N–H abstraction
on the basis of MD studies. Thus, the substrate conformation and the
protein environment around the active site of PHF8 support H-abstraction
from the methyl group of the substrate to form a ferric–hydroxyl
species and a substrate-based radical.

3.7 Conformational Flexibility, Molecular Orbitals,
and Six-Coordinated Fe(IV)=O in the Hydrogen Atom Transfer
We performed multiple reaction path calculations starting from
different structures of the ferryl–oxo complex generated by
MD to explore the effects of conformational flexibility on the HAT.
In all the HAT transition states, the iron-center is stabilized by
a chain of hydrogen bonding water molecules. The orientation of the
H3K9me2 substrate toward the ferryl–oxo is maintained by interactions
from I191 and H3R8. The nonbonded oxygen of Fe-coordinated Asp249
makes hydrogen with N333. The Boltzmann-averaged reaction barrier
for the rate-determining first hydrogen abstraction step using five
snapshots was found to be 18.19 kcal/mol at QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of
theory (Table 1) and
compares reasonably well with the experimental barrier of 21.3 kcal/mol
(calculated from a rate constant of 5.4 h–1)17 and other computational studies on similar 2OG
oxygenases.95,96,101,102

The ferryl–oxo complex RC2 is
considered “in-line”,
as its Fe=O bond is oriented along the direction of the substrate
(taken as the z-axis).98,99 In the quintet
spin state of RC2, the Fe 3d orbitals are split into
two π* orbitals (π*xz and
π*yz), two σ* (σ*x2–y2 and σ*z2) orbitals,
and a nonbonding (δxy) orbital.
The antibonding interactions between the 3d orbitals of Fe and the
2p orbitals of the oxo ligand result in the π*xz and π*yz orbitals, instead
of π*xy and π*yz, as in IM3 (Figure S14).
The σ*z2 in RC2 is the result of an antibonding interaction between the 3dz2 orbital of the Fe and the 2pz orbital of the oxo group; the σ*x2– y2 orbital arises from an antibonding interaction between 3dx2–y2 of Fe and ligands in the x–y plane (H247, D249, and succinate). Therefore, the orbital
occupancy of quintet RC2 is δxy1 π*xz1π*yz1σ*x2–y21σ*z20. The orbital arrangement in RC2 leads to
a stabilization of α-spin orbitals via an exchange enhanced
reactivity, which lowers the energy of the α–σ*z2 orbital.98,99,103,104 Thus, there
are two types of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), the σ*z2 and the degenerate π*xz/yz available for hydrogen
atom abstraction.98,99 In the RC2, the
σ*z2 orbital lies along
the direction of the ferryl–oxo bond, while the π* orbitals
lie perpendicular to the direction of the Fe–O vector.

For the transition states of hydrogen transfer, the orbital overlap
is optimized by a Fe–O–H angle close to 180° for
σ* electron transfer and a Fe–O–H angle close
to 120° for π* electron transfer (Figure 6).98,99 Several calculated
transition states of HAT reactions by Fe(IV)=O species have
shown to follow these orbital-selection rules.98−100

Figure 6 Orbital selection
rules for the hydrogen abstraction process in
high-spin (S = 2) non-heme iron–oxo intermediates.

To investigate how electron transfer in PHF8 occurs,
we analyzed
transition state geometries from the five QM/MM snapshots for the
HAT from the C–H bond. The ∠Fe–O–H in
the transition state of all the five reaction paths remains in the
range of 142°–164°, implying electron transfer via
the σ* pathway. In PHF8, a transition state ∠Fe–O–H
close to 180° is favored due to an interaction between the I191
side chain and the methyl groups of the substrate. The spin natural
orbital (SNO) of the HAT transition state (TS6) shows
electron transfer to the ferryl–oxo σ*z2 orbital (Figure 7). σ*−α-electron transfer is supported
by the residual negative spin density on the substrate carbon (Table 1). Thus, in PHF8 (RC2), electron transfer occurs via a σ channel to the
ferryl–oxo σ*z2 orbital.

Figure 7 Transition state spin natural orbitals (SNO) of the HAT (TS6) from C–H with orbital occupancies in the bracket.

To explore the effect of additional water coordination
at the ferryl–oxo
stage, including on the hydrogen atom transfer reaction barrier, we
performed a QM/MM potential energy scan starting from the six-coordinated
ferryl–oxo IM7. The reaction barrier for hydrogen
abstraction from methyl C–H of the substrate was found to be
21.7 kcal/mol at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory for the ferryl–oxo
with additional water. The activation barrier for hydrogen atom transfer
from the six-coordinated ferryl–oxo species is thus within
the range of activation energy obtained from the five-coordinated
ferryl–oxo intermediate.

3.8 Following HAT, the Reaction Proceeds through
Rebound Rather than Desaturation
While the rate-limiting
step for demethylation by PHF8 (at least once the substrate is bound
at the active site) is hydrogen abstraction, the following step raises
another interesting mechanistic question. The product formed after
HAT, i.e., the ferric–hydroxyl species (IM9),
can either undergo a rebound reaction to form the hydroxylated product
or produce a desaturated product by abstracting the second hydrogen
from NH to give an iminium ion which could then undergo hydrolysis
(Figure 8A). This mechanistic
dilemma manifests itself in other 2OG demethylases and some other
related enzymes (in some cases, both hydroxylation and desaturation
are observed;12 a synthetic model of the
non-heme oxygenases has shown desaturation to be a feasible mechanistic
option).105 The factors governing the Fe(III)–OH
species to act as hydroxylase or desaturase have been shown to depend
on bond strength, coordination-sphere, and ligand sphere flexibility,
and steric effects.105,106

Bond lengths are in angstroms.

In the absence of experimental data on enzyme-bound
hydroxylated
intermediates in KDMs catalysis, we explored the effects of the protein
environment on the selection of the reaction path after the HAT; we
investigated the reactivity of the ferric-hydroxyl product formed
after HAT (IM9) to undergo rebound hydroxylation and
desaturation (Figure 8A). The potential energy profiles for rebound (IM9-TS8-PD1) and desaturation (IM9-TS9-PD2) reactions are shown in Figure 8B. The calculated activation
energies are 12.4 and 22.2 kcal/mol for TS8 and TS9 at the QM(B2+ZPE)/MM level of theory for the rebound and
the desaturation reaction, respectively. The D3 dispersion corrected
energies also support the rebound over the desaturation mechanism
(see Table S13 and Table S15 for spin densities).
The calculations show a clear preference for a rebound process in
the presence of the PHF8 protein environment. Steric effects are a
major factor helping favor a rebound over a desaturation pathway,
including those involving I191. As seen earlier for calculations on
the hydrogen atom abstraction step (Figure 4), the substrate conformation does not make
N–H easily accessible to the IM9 intermediate
because of steric constraints; in IM9 it is stabilized
via hydrogen bonding (with iron-bound aspartate D249), thus rendering
desaturation unfavorable (Figure 8C). The hydroxyl group in IM9 might have
reduced electrophilicity compared to a ferryl–oxo group (the
spin density on the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group reduces to 0.22
after HAT from a spin density of 0.55), making it a bad electrophile
for a second hydrogen abstraction step/desaturation from the NH bond.
Radical delocalization is also an important factor in determining
whether rebound or desaturation occurs; if the radical is relatively
delocalized, desaturation is more preferred; if the radical is localized,
then rebound is preferred.105 The electron
density of (−1.04) on the carbon atom in IM9 shows
the radical is localized on the carbon-atom, making rebound more likely.
Thus, steric effects by the protein environment, hydrogen-bond stabilization
of the NH species with iron-bound aspartate D249, and radical localization
contribute to the rebound reaction being energetically preferred over
desaturation in PHF8 catalysis.

4 Conclusions
We used multiple microsecond
MDs and QM/MM simulations to explore
the catalytic strategy of the non-heme Fe(II) and 2OG-dependent histone
lysine demethylase PHF8, which is involved in key epigenetic processes.
Similarly to other 2OG-dependent non-heme enzymes, PHF8 follows an
O2 activation pathway wherein a ferric–superoxo
intermediate reacts with the Fe-complexed C2 carbonyl group of 2OG
leading to decarboxylation and formation of a ferryl–oxo complex
and succinate. If generated from a starting complex in which the 2OG
C1 carboxylate is complexed to the Fe trans to His247,
the so generated ferryl–oxo complex has an “off-line”
geometry, i.e., is unproductive for catalysis. This unproductive species
has been proposed to undergo a ferryl-flip via oxygen atom exchange
with a water molecule to form an “in-line” productive
ferryl–oxo species (trans to His319); however,
our calculations indicate that this process is energetically unfavorable.
Instead, we propose that at a five-coordinate 2OG-bound state prior
to dioxygen binding, 2OG flips from an “off-line” to
an “in-line” coordination geometry, in a process with
a minimal energy barrier, thus enabling the subsequent, direct production
of “in-line” ferric-superoxo, succinyl–peroxo,
and ferryl–oxo intermediates. The “in-line” ferryl–oxo
intermediate is thus in a productive orientation with respect to the
substrate for the subsequent reaction steps.

QM/MM calculations
imply that hydrogen abstraction occurs from
a C–H bond of substrate Nε-methyl group; by
contrast, hydrogen abstraction from Nε–H is
a highly energy-inefficient process, in part due to the substrate
conformation relative to the ferryl–oxo species and steric
repulsion from the second sphere residue I191. By analyzing multiple
reaction paths for the HAT step, we show that hydrogen abstraction
proceeds via a σ channel. The QM/MM calculations in the presence
of the protein environment of PHF8 show that the rebound pathway is
more energetically favored than desaturation due to the substrate
conformation, second sphere interactions, and reduced reactivity of
Fe–OH species generated after HAT.

Overall our studies
provide key insights into the atomistic effects
of the protein environment on the reaction path of PHF8 and distinguish
between alternative mechanistic proposals for hydroxylation/demethylation
of the substrate Nε-methyl group. Presently, with
rare exceptions (e.g., meldonium107), most
2OG oxygenase inhibitors, including one recently approved for clinical
use, are active site Fe-chelators that compete with 2OG.108,109 Such compounds, however, block rather than modulate 2OG oxygenase
activity with consequent potential “on target” side
effects in the presence of excess inhibitor. We hope that the detailed
mechanistic insights presented here for PHF8, as well as ongoing work
on other 2OG oxygenases, will help enable the design of mechanism-based
inhibitors of 2OG oxygenases that modulate kinetics, e.g., by slowing
the movement of the 2OG C1 carboxylate from an “off-line”
to an “in-line” geometry.
