In this report, we establish that
DM-Segphos copper(I) complexes
are efficient catalysts for the enantioselective borylation of para-quinone methides. This method provides straightforward
access to chiral monobenzylic and dibenzylic boronic esters, with
enantiomeric ratios up to 96:4, using a commercially available chiral
phosphine. Standard manipulations of the C–B bond afford a
variety of chiral diaryl derivatives.

Chiral secondary
boronic esters
are important intermediates in organic synthesis, because they are
precursors of chiral alcohols, chiral amines, and tertiary stereocenters.1 Among them, dibenzylic boronates such as B are especially interesting, because they can provide a variety
of enantiomerically enriched diaryl derivatives (see Scheme 1). The diarylmethane framework
represents a privileged structural motif widely found in pharmaceuticals.2 Most of these biologically active compounds present
a chiral center at the benzylic position with a stereodefined C–O,
C–N, or C–C bond. We envisioned that functionalization
of the C–B bond in B could offer a unified strategy
for the preparation of these compounds, from a common intermediate.
However, the enantioselective synthesis of dibenzylic boronic esters
is still a difficult challenge in chemical synthesis.

Scheme 1 Chiral
Dibenzylic Boronic Esters
At the outset of this project, the only method available
for the
synthesis of boronates such as B involved the use of
chiral lithiated carbamates and aryl boronic esters (Scheme 1).1b Despite the undoubted significance of this approach, the yields
were moderate, and a stoichiometric amount of a chiral ligand was
required. As part of our interest in unconventional C–B bond
formation,3 we envisioned a new approach
toward the synthesis of dibenzylic boronates through the enantioselective
1,6-addition of a chiral copper-(I) boryl complex to a p-quinone methide (Scheme 1).4,5 Formally, p-quinone methides
are neutral entities with a zwitterionic resonance structure that
enhances the electrophilic character at the δ-position. Surprisingly,
while ortho-quinone methides have been broadly used
in asymmetric synthesis,6 only two catalytic
enantioselective additions to para-quinone methides
have been reported.7,8 Both methods use carbon-based
nucleophiles and an organocatalyst to control the enantioselectivity.
Therefore, we became intrigued in exploring these compounds for several
reasons:(1)  the use of asymmetric
metal catalysis
to functionalize p-quinone methides remained unexplored;

(2)  the introduction of a
boronic ester
unit in ortho- or para-quinone methides
had not been reported; and

(3)  the stereoselective addition of heteroatomic
nucleophiles to p-quinone methides had not been studied
to date.

Herein, we describe the synthesis of
dibenzylic boronates through
the borylative aromatization of p-quinone methides
with good yields and high enantiomeric ratio (er) values, under mild
reaction conditions and using a commercially available chiral phosphine.9,10

While unsubstituted p-quinone methides (R2, R3 = H) are too reactive to be isolated, 2,6-disubstituted
derivatives are easy to handle. We began our study with p-quinone methide 1a, which contains removable t-Bu groups at the α-positions (Table 1).11 When 1a was treated in THF with Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 (10 mol %), B2pin2 (1.5
equiv), NaOt-Bu (0.2 equiv), and methanol (MeOH)
(4 equiv) in the absence of ligand, we observed the formation of product 2a with moderate yield (Table 1, entry 1). This background reaction showed the feasibility
of the transformation but also revealed a serious handicap for the
development of an asymmetric version. We soon realized that the yields
and stereoselectivities were highly dependent on the ligand (Table 1, entries 2–7).12 Commercially available (R)-DM-Segphos
was superior to other chiral ligands affording the desired dibenzylic
boronate 2a in good yield and high enantiomeric ratio
at room temperature (Table 1, entry 7, er = 96:4). The reaction can be carried out with
5 mol % copper salt and 5.5 mol % of chiral phosphine
(Table 1, entry 8)
without affecting the enantioselectivity, although the yield observed
under these conditions was slightly lower. Interestingly, in the absence
of MeOH, we observed product formation but moderate er values (Table 1, entry 9).

With
the optimal conditions in hand, we studied the scope of the
borylative aromatization. The catalytic system was robust for p-quinone methides with different aromatic R1 substituents at the δ-carbon (Table 2, structures 2a–2g). Dibenzylic boronic esters with a larger naphthyl group
(2b) or with electron-rich aromatic substituents (2c and 2d) were prepared in similarly good yields
and high er values.

Diaryl derivatives
with electron-withdrawing groups at the meta- (2e), para- (2f), or ortho- position (2g) were also
synthesized, with excellent stereocontrol. In addition, the absolute
configuration of 2g was determined by single-crystal
X-ray crystallography.13 Importantly, a p-quinone methide bearing an alkyl group at the δ-carbon
afforded the monobenzylic boronic ester 2h with good
yield and high er value. Alkyl groups with different steric hindrance
(methyl (Me) and isopropyl (i-Pr)) can also be introduced
at the α-position (R2) without affecting the yields
and enantioselectivities (2i–2n).

To further explore the scope of this reaction, we studied the borylative
aromatization reaction with more challenging nonsymmetric p-quinone methides (1o and 1p;
see Scheme 2). These
substrates were synthesized as E/Z mixtures of the exocyclic double bond. Surprisingly, E/Zp-quinone methides 1o and 1p afforded dibenzylic boronic esters 2o and 2p with high enantioselectivities. This result
is striking and significantly increases the potential structural scope
of the method. These experiments indicate that the stereodiscrimination
of the prochiral Si-face is not dependent on the geometry of the exocyclic
double bond in the p-quinone methide.14,15

Scheme 2 Borylative Aromatization of Nonsymmetric p-Quinone
Methides
Overall, commercially
available DM-Segphos consistently provides
high er values and overcomes some of the structural limitations found
with the use of chiral sulfoxide-phosphine ligands (prepared in four
steps), recently reported by Liao.10 In
the latter case, p-quinone methides with ortho- substitution on the aromatic ring (similar to 1g) and groups with less steric hindrance α to the carbonyl
(similar to 1i–1n) afforded only
moderate enantioselectivities (er = 84:16/75:25). Our catalyst system
provides similar compounds with higher stereocontrol (compounds 2g, 2i–2n, er ≥ 95:5).
More significantly, we have expanded the scope of the reaction to p-quinone methides bearing alkyl substituents at the R1 position (1h) and to the challenging nonsymmetric p-quinone methides (1o and 1p),
which previously have not been studied.

Functionalization of
the C–B bond provided several monobenzylic,
dibenzylic, and triaryl derivatives (Scheme 3). Oxidation of the C–B bond allows
for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched diarylmethanols in
high yields. In addition, we have prepared triarylmethane 5 from boronate 4 with excellent stereoretention (97%
specificity).1c To the best of our knowledge,
this transition-metal-free C(sp3)–C(sp2) coupling has not been used before with secondary dibenzylic boronates.
Homologation and oxidation of monobenzylic boronate 2h gave alcohol 6 in good overall yield. Finally, treatment
of 6 with AlCl3 in refluxing benzene resulted
in removal of the tert-butyl groups, followed by
Friedel–Crafts reaction to afford phenol 7.

Scheme 3 C–B Bond Functionalization
In order to gain insight into the reaction mechanism and
to ascertain
the reasons for the observed enantioselectivity, we performed quantum
calculations at the DFT level. For this study, we used (R)-Segphos-Cu(I) complexes and p-quinone methide 1i (R2 = Me, R1 = Ph) as models. Noteworthy,
no simplification of the ligand structure was used in order to properly
consider the steric effects around the metal center. As shown in Scheme 4, the boryl cupration
is a highly exoergic and, therefore, irreversible process. Since the
absolute configuration of the new stereogenic carbon is fixed in this
step, enantioselectivity is kinetically controlled. Transition states
for the boryl cupration (TSR and TSS) were located and allowed the calculation of the corresponding
activation energies for the formation of both enantiomers. The free
energy of TSS is 0.9 kcal mol–1 lower than that corresponding
to TSR, because
of better substrate accommodation within the complex pocket for the
former. This value is in accord with the observed enantioselectivity
using 1a and (R)-Segphos (Table 1, entry 6). Intrinsic reaction
coordinate studies connect these TS with long distance association
adducts formed prior to the boryl cupration step (IS and IR; see Scheme 4).16 Calculated
energies suggest the boryl cupration reaction as the rate-limiting
step, as well as the enantioselective step.

ΔG values
are represented in kcal mol–1, considering IS as 0.0.

The Cu complexes formed after the alkene insertion show a long
Cu–C distance with the C atom involved in the reaction (IIS and IIR; see Scheme 4). In fact, the structure is
reminiscent of a (π-allyl)Cu complex. These complexes would
become protonated in a subsequent step. We have also calculated the
energy for isomer IIIs corresponding
to the slipping of the borylated substrate to afford a copper-phenoxide
complex (Figure 1).
This process is highly exoergic, and for that reason, we propose that
protonation most likely takes place at the Cu–O bond.17

In summary, we have developed
a new method for the asymmetric synthesis
of useful monobenzylic and dibenzylic boronic esters via a novel copper-catalyzed
borylation of p-quinone methides. For the first time,
consistently high enantioselectivities are observed using a commercially
available phosphine ligand. The products are versatile intermediates
for the enantioselective synthesis of monoaryl, diaryl, and triaryl
derivatives. Calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level
fully agree with experimental observations and provide insight for
the development of new asymmetric transformations.

During
the preparation of this manuscript, Liao et al. published
a closely related paper using a sulfoxide-phosphine ligand (published
online Aug. 28, 2015): Lou Y. ; Cao P. ; Jia T. ; Zhang Y. ; Wang M. ; Liao J.  Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2015 , 54 , 12134 .10.1002/anie.201505926 We have
observed similar enantioselectivities using a commercially available
ligand and running the reaction at room temperature. In addition,
our catalytic system can overcome some of the structural limitations
found in the excellent work by Liao.

CCDC
1405406 contains the supplementary crystallographic data. These data
can be obtained free of charge at www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html. The absolute configuration of the other dibenzylic boronates was
assigned by analogy.
1H NMR experiments at shorter
reaction times did not show olefin isomerization of the starting E/Z mixture.


We have proposed a stereochemical model based
on DFT calculations, which show that steric interactions between the
double bond substituent and the ligand play an important role in the
stereodiscrimination. See Supporting Information for details.


Formation
of these adducts is endoergic,
for entropy reasons, as expected for an associative process. Other
higher-energy real coordination complex could be located (see Supporting Information, IVR), but they are not productive, since they are not
connected to the transition states, as shown by IRC studies.


We cannot rule out direct reaction
of the
copper phenoxide with B2pin2 to generate a borylated
phenol and a copper(I)-boryl complex that would start over the catalytic
cycle.
