Circular
permutation of the NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase
Old Yellow Enzyme from Saccharomyces pastorianus (OYE1) can significantly enhance the enzyme’s catalytic performance.
Termini relocation into four regions of the protein (sectors I–IV)
near the active site has proven effective in altering enzyme function.
To better understand the structural consequences and rationalize the
observed functional gains in these OYE1 variants, we selected representatives
from sectors I–III for further characterization by biophysical
methods and X-ray crystallography. These investigations not only show
trends in enzyme stability and quaternary structure as a function
of termini location but also provide a possible explanation for the
catalytic gains in our top-performing OYE variant (new N-terminus
at residue 303; sector III). Crystallographic analysis indicates that
termini relocation into sector III affects the loop β6 region
(amino acid positions: 290–310) of OYE1, which forms a lid
over the active site. Peptide backbone cleavage greatly enhances local
flexibility, effectively converting the loop into a tether and consequently
increasing the environmental exposure of the active site. Interestingly,
such an active site remodeling does not negatively impact the enzyme’s
activity and stereoselectivity; neither does it perturb the conformation
of other key active site residues with the exception of Y375. These
observations were confirmed in truncation experiments, deleting all
residues of the loop β6 region in our OYE variant. Intrigued
by the finding that circular permutation leaves most of the key catalytic
residues unchanged, we also tested OYE permutants for possible additive
or synergistic effects of amino acid substitutions. Distinct functional
changes in these OYE variants were detected upon mutations at W116,
known in native OYE1 to cause inversion of diastereoselectivity for
(S)-carvone reduction. Our findings demonstrate the
contribution of loop β6 toward determining the stereoselectivity
of OYE1, an important insight for future OYE engineering efforts.

==== Body
Introduction
Members of the Old
Yellow Enzyme (OYE) family [EC 1.3.1.31] are
popular biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of alkenes. Operating
at ambient temperatures and under benign environmental conditions,
these flavin oxidoreductases give direct access to chiral synthons
with up to two stereogenic centers by catalyzing a highly stereoselective
trans-hydrogenation. In addition, their inherent substrate promiscuity
enables conversion of a wide range of substrates including α,β-unsaturated
ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, nitriles, and nitroalkenes,
as well as nitrate esters, nitroaromatics, and triazines.1−10 The redox reaction proceeds via a Michael-type hydride transfer
step from reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to the substrate’s
β-carbon with concomitant protonation at its α-position.
After product release, the oxidized flavin cofactor is regenerated
via reduction by NADPH (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Flavin-Dependent
ene Reduction
Driven by the need
for novel and effective biocatalysts for applications
in biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry, an ever-growing
number of putative OYEs from different organisms and environments
have been reported.4,7,11−14 At the same time, protein engineering by mutagenic methods and directed
evolution has been employed to tailor these enzymes.15−17 Complementing these protein engineering efforts, we have been exploring
the impact of circular permutation (CP) on the catalytic performance
of enzymes. In contrast to the traditional protein engineering approaches
that modify enzyme function through substitution of amino acids, CP
keeps the amino acid composition unchanged but reorganizes the protein’s
primary sequence. During the process of CP, the native N- and C-termini
of a protein are covalently linked with a short peptide, and new termini
are introduced through backbone cleavage elsewhere in the polypeptide
sequence.18 Examples of such termini relocation
are found in nature.19−21 In addition, the method has frequently been used
in the laboratory, initially in protein folding experiments22−26 and more recently for protein engineering.27−32 An analysis of the effects of CP on natural and laboratory-based
evolution of proteins has revealed potential functional benefits through
changes in local protein conformation and backbone flexibility near
the newly created termini. These changes to protein dynamics may reshape
access tunnels and active site binding pockets as well as accelerate
or even eliminate rate-limiting conformational changes in the catalytic
reaction cycle.

To explore and possibly exploit some of these
changes to protein
structure and function in flavin oxidoreductases for creating novel
biocatalysts, we recently applied the CP approach to OYE1 from Saccharomyces pastorianus.32 Earlier structural studies of OYE1 had identified several loop regions
and helix α1 (Figure 1) that partially
cover the bound FMN and shape the active site located in the central
part of the (βα)8-barrel protein.33−35 On the basis of these structural features, we hypothesized that
CP could have a significant functional impact on the enzyme. The idea
was tested by preparing and functionally characterizing a synthetic
gene library of 228 circular permutants of OYE1.32 More importantly, we identified 70 circular permutated
OYE (cpOYE) variants with activity equal to or better than wild type
for reduction of ketoisophorone 1 to (R)-levodione 2 (Scheme 1). Some
of these variants showed rate enhancements of over an order of magnitude,
and none of the tested cpOYEs compromising the parental enzyme’s
high enantioselectivity.

Similar functional gains were found
with other substrates, including
stereoselective conversion of (S)-carvone 3 to the (1R/4S)-diastereomer of
dihydrocarvone 4. Interestingly, the new termini locations
in these 70 cpOYE clustered in four specific sectors of the protein
sequence: sector I stretches over most of the exterior helical region
α1 (amino acid residues 125–160; numbering based on OYE1),
sector II includes loop β5 and parts of subsequent helix α5
(residues 250–265), sector III covers loop β6 (residues
290–310), and sector IV colocates with a short loop near the
native C-terminus (residues 375–380) (Figure 1). All four sectors cover loop regions and secondary structure
elements near the active site, and as anticipated, three of them (sectors
I–III) have been identified in biochemical and structural studies
as possible candidates undergoing substantial conformational changes
during the catalytic cycle.33−40 Because several cpOYE variants with new termini in these three sectors
show significant functional improvements, we investigated the impact
of CP on the ternary and quaternary structures as well as the stability
of these biocatalysts. Variants from sector IV were not included in
these studies because the observed functional gains were modest at
best.

Super positioning of the three structures was based on the FMN cofactor,
shown in sticks. The three helices at the dimer interface (α4,
α5, and α6) and the native OYE1 termini are labeled. The
two inserts focus on the new termini regions in cpOYE154 (right) and
cpOYE303 (left). Red arrows mark the locations of backbone cleavage
(shown on OYE1) upon circular permutation, illustrating the portions
of protein sequence invisible in the CP variants due to a lack of
electron density.

To better understand
the structural and functional consequences
of termini relocation in cpOYE variants, we selected representatives
from each sector and examined them in a series of biophysical studies.
Separately, four sets of X-ray crystallographic data were collected
for representatives from sectors I and III. The latter revealed only
minimal structural perturbation of amino acid conformations in positions
other than residues immediately flanking the new N- and C-termini.
The mostly conserved active site environment helped to rationalize
the preservation of parental stereoselectivity in cpOYE variants.
The similar orientation of key catalytic residues further raised questions
about possible additive or synergistic effects of amino acid substitutions
and CP on the function of these biocatalysts. Our initial exploration
of such effects focused on substitutions to the tryptophan at position
116 (W116) in OYE1. W116 is known to affect the diastereoselectivity
of (S)-carvone reduction in OYE1.14,41,42 Although the tested cpOYE variants did not
show the predicted change in stereoselectivity, our findings provide
new insight regarding the contribution of loop regions on OYE1 function.

Results
and Discussion
Primary Characterization of cpOYE Variants
We initially
studied structural changes of selected cpOYE variants by circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography. Nine
candidates were chosen on the basis of either the location of their
new termini or enhancements in catalytic performance using the results
from our previous study of cpOYE1 variants.32 More specifically, representatives from each of the three sectors
(sector I, residues 125–160; sector II, residues 250–265;
sector III, 290–310) that yielded catalytically active permutants
were investigated. Probing for differences in secondary structure,
the far-UV CD spectra of these enzyme variants showed no significant
change (Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1). The overall mixed β/α signature found in OYE1 was
conserved in all cpOYE candidates.

The same experimental setup
was used to assess the thermostability of enzyme variants by measuring
spectral change at 222 nm as a function of temperature (Table 1 and SI Figure S2). Although
the temperature of unfolding (TM) for
native OYE1 was measured at 49 °C, the thermal robustness of
CP variants varied quite significantly. The three candidates with
new termini in sector I (cpOYE146, -154, and -160) exhibited significantly
higher TM values, raising the half point
of unfolding by 15 to 23 °C. The temperature range for the folded-to-unfolded
transition of these variants is only slightly broader than OYE1, suggesting
that the termini relocation does enhance the structural integrity
of sector I variants (SI Figure S2). The
underlying reason for the increased stability is not clear. Although
size exclusion experiments (see below) indicate some protein with
quaternary conformation greater than dimer, the small fraction (<10%
of total purified protein) is insufficient to account for the observed TM gains. The sole representative from sector
II, cpOYE260, closely matched the stability of wild type enzyme.

The five remaining candidates (cpOYE291, -292, -303, -305, and
-307) were selected from sector III, the region with variants that
showed the most substantive catalytic improvements.32 Sector III is located entirely in loop β6, an extended
loop region that flanks the FMN binding site and whose tip (N294 to
L297) forms part of the active site binding pocket. Interestingly,
CP variants with their new termini in the N-terminal stem of the loop
exhibit TM values slightly lower than
wild type enzyme (cpOYE291 and -292). In contrast, variants with new
termini in the C-terminal portion of the loop trend in the opposite
direction, yielding enzymes with elevated temperatures of unfolding
by 6–8 °C. These overall changes are small but show correlation
with the termini location. Although residues flanking positions 291
and 292 are facing the protein’s interior environment, amino
acid residues 303–307 are surface-exposed. The latter, although
less disruptive to the protein’s tertiary structure than the
former, would be expected to result in great local flexibility, a
prediction that is consistent with the notably broader temperature
transition for protein unfolding compared to cpOYE291 and -292. In
summary, our thermodenaturation data demonstrate that CP does not
automatically translate into destabilization of a protein. To the
contrary, results for selected OYE1 variants indicate that termini
relocation can have a substantial stabilizing effect.

Finally, we used size-exclusion chromatography to
examine potential
quaternary structure changes upon sequence reorganization by CP. Such
changes can impact protein stability as observed in dimeric variants
of the normally monomeric lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB).43 Separately, enzyme activity
can be affected by the quaternary structure change, as seen for the
OYE1 homologue 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3 (OPR3).44 Our analysis confirmed the dimeric solution
state for wild type OYE1, consistent with previously reports for the
native enzyme (Table 1 and SI Figure S3).33 For representatives
of sector I, quaternary structure varied from mostly monomeric (cpOYE160)
to mono/dimeric mixtures (cpOYE146 and -154), reflected in broad signal
peaks. In addition, chromatograms for these three variants also show
higher-molecular-weight species, hinting the presence of small amounts
of trimeric or tetrameric assemblies. In contrast, the elution profile
for cpOYE260 (sector II) suggests almost exclusively monomeric enzyme,
whereas the SEC data for cpOYE variants with termini in sector III
show native-like dimeric quaternary structure. These latter findings
can be rationalized on the basis of the OYE1 dimer interface involving
helices α4, α5, and α6 (Figure 1). In cpOYE260, the new termini are located at the very beginning
of helix 5, which is likely to affect the local structure integrity
and, consequently, disrupt the dimer interface. Interestingly, the
same reorganization of the protein sequence in the adjacent loop β6−α6
region (sector III) leaves the oligomeric state of the enzyme unchanged.
The less disruptive effects of new termini in sector III is explained
by the 3–10-residue spacing between α6 and the backbone
cleavage sites.

Structure Analysis by X-ray Crystallography
To further
explore the observed differences in catalytic performance and biophysical
properties in our cpOYE collection, we expanded our structural study
to analyze three representatives by X-ray crystallography. One candidate
from each sector (I, cpOYE154; II, cpOY260; III, cpOYE303) was chosen
for crystallization. Following overexpression and purification of
the individual proteins, crystal growth conditions were screened for
each candidate. We obtained diffraction quality crystals for cpOYE154
and cpOYE303. Both variants contained a bound FMN and diffracted X-ray
to 1.25 and 2.69 Å resolution, respectively (Table 2, PDB ID: 4RNX and 4RNU).
Separately, cpOYE303 crystals were soaked in a solution of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA), a tight-binding competitive
inhibitor of OYE1, yielding structural information on the enzyme·FMN·inhibitor
complex at 2.47 Å resolution (PDB ID: 4RNV). The crystallographic asymmetric unit
contains four complexes. Interestingly, we found that HBA could be
fitted best into the electron density in two orientations, depending
on the molecule: a first orientation with its aldehyde moiety in hydrogen
bonding distance to amino acids H191/N194 (Figure 2A) and a second, flipped orientation similar to that seen
for wild type OYE1 (Figure 2B).33 For our third cpOYE candidate, all attempts
failed to find conditions for producing suitable crystals of cpOYE260.
The inability to grow crystals of this variant might be linked to
its observed quaternary structure changes and lower temperature of
unfolding (Table 1). The resulting disruption
of critical interprotein contacts and elevated structural heterogeneity
could interfere with crystal growth.

cpOYE303 (PBD: 4RNV) with key amino
acid side chains (orange), FMN (white), and substrate analog p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA; gray). (A) In two of the four
protein complexes per asymmetric unit, the best fit to the observed
electron density orients the aldehyde group of HBA in hydrogen-bonding

and N194, as seen for OYE1.33 The gray

The three crystallized cpOYE variants show high overall structural
similarities with the parental OYE1, yet exhibit significant conformational
perturbation near the old and new termini regions. Superposition of
cpOYE154 and cpOYE303 with wild type enzyme (PDB: 1OYA)33 resulted in root-mean-square deviation (RMSDs) of 0.38
and 0.44 Å (over the entire protein length), respectively (Figure 1). For cpOYE154, the protein sequence could be modeled
continuously from residue 154 to 144 (all residue numbering based
on OYE1) visualizing the entire new N-terminal region while missing
only nine amino acids at the C-terminus (amino acid positions 145–153).
In the case of cpOYE303, the electron density map matched residues
306–291, with the exception of two amino acid residues in the
linker region connecting the native termini. The notably higher crystallographic
thermal B-factor in the linker region of cpOYE154 (SI Figure S4) and the gap in electron density for
cpOYE303 suggests that future redesigns might be possible with shorter
or no linker at all. The protein backbone seems well adapted to accommodate
the additional steric strain introduced upon ligation of the native
termini. For cpOYE303, there is also a lack of electron density in
the new termini regions, leaving out three N-terminal residues (positions
303–305) and 11 C-terminal amino acids (positions 292–302).
Given the region’s proximity to the enzyme active site, we
speculated that the binding of the competitive inhibitor HBA to cpOYE303
could help with orienting additional residues. The presence of HBA
did slightly improve the overall structure resolution but did not
affect the N- and C-terminal regions. In fact, the indistinguishable
structures of cpOYE303 with and without HBA in the active site led
us to base all further discussion of full-length cpOYE303 in this
manuscript on the coordinates for the HBA-bound enzyme.

Focusing
on the active site, CP did not perturb the position of
key catalytic residues in either OYE variant but affected the solvent
accessibility of the catalytic center (Figure 3). Supported by clearly defined electron density for FMN, the orientation
of the bound cofactor is identical in the two variants compared with
OYE1. Furthermore, we analyzed both variants for changes to the positions
and side chain conformations of amino acid residues within 12 Å
of the FMN N5 atom. In addition to the obvious absence
of the highly flexible residues near the new termini in CP variants,
the comparison with native OYE1 (based on 1OYA33) revealed only small changes in the side chain orientation
of Y375. For cpOYE154, the phenol moiety of Y375 is rotated by −20°
around χ2, whereas in cpOYE303, the same residue
swings in the opposite direction by 20° and 40° around χ1 and χ2, respectively. Interestingly, the
orientation of Y375 in cpOYE303 closely resembles the side chain position
in structures with bound substrate (analogs) (Figure 4A/B). Furthermore, β-factor analysis indicated no significant
changes in backbone flexibility near the active sites (SI Figure S4).

In contrast, the mapping of
the enzymes’ interior surface,
including the substrate and FMN binding pocket, revealed quite significant
structural changes. The substrate-bound structure for OYE1 shows only
a narrow access channel to the protein surface near Y196 (Figure 3A). The same channel is slightly enlarged in cpOYE154
(Figure 3C). Although direct comparison of
the two structures is complicated by the absence of substrate (analog)
in the latter, the increased active site accessibility in the CP variant
could account for observed moderate gains in catalytic activity.32 In cpOYE303, the termini relocation into loop
β6 has a much more dramatic impact on the shape and solvent
accessibility of the catalytic center (Figure 3B). In wild type enzyme, this loop forms a lid that sequesters bound
FMN and substrate from the environment. Moreover, conformational changes
in the loop region are thought to be part of the catalytic cycle.
Upon CP, peptide bond cleavage at position 302/303 disrupts the orderly
arrangement of the loop and significantly widens the access tunnel
to the active site without interfering with residues in the substrate
binding pocket or the flavin cofactor. Such changes enable faster
exchange of substrate and product but do not perturb catalytic action.

Termini Truncation in cpOYE303
The invisible residues
at the newly created amino and carboxy termini of cpOYE303 were the
focus of further biochemical and biophysical investigations. The absence
of electron density is typically associated with increased protein
backbone flexibility, a common phenomenon in termini regions. The
same effect was observed in previous CP experiments with CALB and
is at least in part responsible for the functional improvements of
the biocatalyst.27,43,45 Nevertheless, subsequent studies with CALB variants have shown that
the contributions of these invisible regions can be more complex and
critical to function. We therefore decided to evaluate the functional
role of the two terminal regions in cpOYE303 by creating a truncated
variant (cpOYE303T). Nucleotides encoding for the three invisible
residues at the N-terminus and the 11 amino acids at the C-terminus
of the gene sequence in cpOYE303 were deleted, followed by heterologous
expression of cpOYE303T in Escherichia coli.

Protein preparation as well as basic biochemical and biophysical
characterization did not reveal any significant difference in stability
or catalytic performance of cpOYE303T compared with its parent cpOYE303.
Expression levels were robust and indistinguishable from cpOYE303.
Furthermore, stability as measured by thermal unfolding in the CD
spectrophotometer seems unaffected by the deletion of terminal residues.
The catalytic performance of the truncated variant was tested on the
reduction of ketoisophorone 1 to (R)-levodione 2. No difference was detectable with respect to catalytic
activity or enantioselectivity of cpOYE303T over cpOYE303. In short,
our experiments did not find evidence for any functional changes upon
truncation of the invisible termini, suggesting no essential role
for residues in this region. Consistent with the high degree of functional
similarity between full-length and truncated cpOYE303, the crystal
structures of the two enzymes are perfectly superimposable. At 1.55
Å resolution, the structure of cpOYE303T (PDB ID: 4RNW) provides a more
refined view of the engineered biocatalyst, confirming the absence
of change to the positioning of active site residues, including FMN
seen in cpOYE154 and cpOYE303. Overall, the findings demonstrate the
remarkable robustness of OYE1. The enzyme’s (β/α)8 barrel fold not only accommodates backbone cleavage near
the active site but also can tolerate complete removal of the loop
β6 region without detectable detrimental effects on function
or stability. In contrast, the cleavage or elimination of the loop
region in cpOYE303 and cpOYE303T, respectively, enhances the overall
catalytic performance with several test substrates. As mentioned above,
we rationalize these functional gains by its involvement in a rate-limiting
conformational change as part of the catalytic cycle. Detailed steady-state
experiments and rapid enzyme kinetics studies to investigate the role
of loop β6 on catalysis in native OYE1 and cpOYE303 variants
are ongoing. Consistent with previously reported data, these studies
point to rate enhancements in the enzyme’s oxidative half reaction.32

Secondary Engineering of CP Variants
Beyond CP, we
were interested in exploring the impact of amino acid substitutions
on the catalytic performance of cpOYE303. The combination of CP with
traditional site-directed and random mutagenesis could give rise to
novel OYE variants exhibiting potential functional benefits from additive
or even synergistic effects. To test the idea, we decided to focus
on W116, probably one of more extensively studied amino acid position
in OYE1.14,41,42 The indol
moiety of W116 lines the active site, and amino acid changes in this
position were shown to affect the diastereoselectivity of (S)-carvone 3 reduction in OYE1. Stewart and
co-workers identified substitutions of Ala, Val, or Ile for W116 as
the most effective switches of the enzyme’s stereoselectivity.
Thus, we prepared the W116I variants of cpOYE154 and cpOYE303 and
measured their catalytic performance with (S)-carvone 3 (Figure 5). Our positive control
OYE1(W116I) showed the expected reversal in diastereoselectivity from
the normal R/S product 4 to its S/S diastereomer 5. Similarly, the W116I substitution in cpOYE154 switched
the stereoselectivity, although at only 67% de. We suspect that the
moderate diastereoselectivity for 5 is linked to the
low levels of activity of cpOYE154(W116I). Low signal-to-noise in
the GC analysis complicates the integration of product peaks and,
consequently, the determination of a precise de value. The cause for
the dramatic decline in activity upon introducing W116I in this variant
is unclear because the parental cpOYE154 exhibits excellent stability,
and substitutions in position 116 are generally well tolerated in
OYE1 and other variants. Overall, the results for cpOYE154 supports
the idea that amino acid changes affecting stereoselectivity can be
transferred into the CP variant, although in a nonadditive fashion.

Figure 5 Summary
of catalytic activity and diastereoselectivity of OYE1,
cpOYE154, and cpOYE303 as well as their respective W116I variants.
The percent conversion of (S)-carvone (3) is indicated by column height, and diastereoselectivity based on
formation of (R/S)-4 (blue) versus (S/S)-5 (yellow) is shown in the pie diagrams.

For cpOYE303, the consequences of W116I are in sharp contrast
to
the above results. The amino acid substitution does not significantly
alter the rate of conversion and, at ∼95% de for (R/S)-isomer 4, even slightly improves
the parental enzyme’s diastereoselectivity (∼86%). Given
the unexpected findings for cpOYE303(W116I), we examined our results
in the context of the current understanding of diastereoselectivity-determining
factors in the OYE1-catalyzed reduction of (S)-carvone.
The present model is based on a combination of crystallographic and
experimental data and points toward three key amino acid positions:
W116, F296, and Y375 (Figure 4).14,41

In OYE1, binding of carvone in a catalytically productive
orientation
(Cβ near N5)46 is facilitated
by hydrogen bonding of its carbonyl group with H191 and N194. These
interactions allow for two distinct modes of substrate binding. In
the first mode, the isopropenyl side chain of carvone points toward
F296 and Y375 (Figure 4B), which Stewart refers
to as the “normal” mode because it produces the natural
(R/S)-diastereomer 4. The second mode has the carvone in a “flipped” orientation,
with its side chain directed toward position 116 (Figure 3C). The latter conformation is usually blocked by
W116, but substitutions with Ala, Val, or Ile create a hydrophobic
pocket that can accommodate the isopropenyl moiety, leading to formation
of (S/S)-diastereomer 5. Although OYE1(W116A/V/I) can accommodate substrate in both binding
modes, experiments found that (S)-carvone preferentially
binds in the “flipped” orientation. The observation
was rationalized by the extra entropic cost associated with reorientation
of the F296 and Y375 side chains upon “normal” substrate
binding (Figure 4A/B), which is not necessary
in the “flipped” mode (Figure 4C).

In cpOYE303 (Figure 4D), F296 has
effectively
been removed because of an increase in the flexibility of the nearby
protein termini, which enables the Y375 side chain to assume a preferred
orientation that closely resembles the conformation in the “normal”
binding mode, even in the absence of substrate. The well-defined electron
density map for the Y375 side chain supports this conclusion (Figure 2).47−49 cpOYE303(W116I) therefore represents an
OYE variant without restraints arising from steric repulsion (W116)
and unfavorable energetics of side chain reorganization (F296/Y375).
As a consequence, one might expect a decline in diastereoselectivity
because the “normal” and “flipped” binding
modes are equally accessible; however, our experiments show almost
exclusively formation of the (R/S)-product 4, suggesting
a clear preference for the “normal” enzyme–substrate
interactions.

We conclude that the switch from 94% de for (S/S)-product 5 in OYE1(W116I)
to 95%
de (R/S)-product 4 in
cpOYE303(W116I) is to a significant part controlled by F296. Located
at the tip of loop β6, the residue’s phenyl side chain
seems to restrict rotational movement of neighboring Y375 whose reorientation
is necessary for substrate binding in native OYE1. The deletion of
the entire loop upon CP eliminates these constraints and allows for
preorganization of Y375. Such an arrangement may also lead to tighter
substrate binding, which could contribute to the overall enhancements
in catalytic rates of the oxidative half reaction observed in stopped-flow
experiments. On the basis of our current findings, a more detailed
investigation of the functional role of loop β6 by site-directed
mutagenesis of F296 and flanking residues in the loop region could
prove insightful. Local amino acid changes may also allow for a fine-tuning
of OYE1 diastereoselectivity for carvone and other chiral synthons.
