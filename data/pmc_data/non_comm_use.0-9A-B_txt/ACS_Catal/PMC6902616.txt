The catalytic subnanometric metal clusters with a few
atoms can
be regarded as an intermediate state between single atoms and metal
nanoparticles (>1 nm). Their molecule-like electronic structures
and
flexible geometric structures bring rich chemistry and also a different
catalytic behavior, in comparison with the single-atom or nanoparticulate
counterparts. In this work, by combination of operando IR spectroscopy
techniques and electronic structure calculations, we will show a comparative
study on Pt catalysts for CO + NO reaction at a very low temperature
range (140–200 K). It has been found that single Pt atoms immobilized
on MCM-22 zeolite are not stable under reaction conditions and agglomerate
into Pt nanoclusters and particles, which are the working active sites
for CO + NO reaction. In the case of the catalyst containing Pt nanoparticles
(∼2 nm), the oxidation of CO to CO2 occurs in a
much lower extension, and Pt nanoparticles become poisoned under reaction
conditions because of a strong interaction with CO and NO. Therefore,
only subnanometric Pt clusters allow NO dissociation at a low temperature
and CO oxidation to occur well on the surface, while CO interaction
is weak enough to avoid catalyst poisoning, resulting in a good balance
to achieve enhanced catalytic performance.

Introduction
In the last years, the recognition of
extremely high reactivity
associated with single metal atoms and/or clusters of low atomicity
has open great expectation in “nano” catalysis, specifically
focused in the subnanometer level.1,2 The unique
geometric and electronic structures of the subnanometric metal catalysts
can invoke distinct catalytic properties compared to conventional
nanoparticulate metal catalysts.3

For instance, small Au clusters with less than 10 atoms have been
identified as the catalytically active species in CO,4,5 alkane, and thiol oxidation reactions.6,7 Ag3 clusters supported on Al2O3 catalyze the epoxidation
of propene with O2 with high activity and selectivity at
a low temperature,8 while subnanometric
Cu clusters have been reported to be highly active for the reduction
of CO2 with H2 to methanol9 and for the oxidation of CO with N2O.10 Nevertheless, subnanometric Pt species have
been demonstrated as highly active sites in several catalytic processes,
like CO oxidation, water–gas shift reaction, and the oxidative
dehydrogenation of alkanes.11−13 In addition, recently, subnanometric
Pdn clusters with n <
20 have shown enhanced catalytic activity in the CO + NO reaction
compared to larger particles and single crystals.14,15

Fundamental understanding of those size effects at a molecular
level has been mainly achieved by electronic structure calculations
and surface science studies.16−18 On the other hand, corresponding
studies on size-selected real catalysts have been very scarce because
of the sophisticated catalyst preparation methods needed for controlling
metal cluster atomicity and the lack of characterization methods enabling
resolution at a molecular and atomic level. Recently, our group has
succeeded in the preparation of Au and Pt clusters of low atomicity
stabilized inside pure-silica zeolite,19,20 which opens
the possibility to explore those catalysts for potential industrial
applications, for instance, aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol
and cyclohexanone and propane dehydrogenation to propylene. By in
situ transmission electron microscopy and IR spectroscopy, we have
also observed the relevance of dynamic structural transformation of
subnanometric Pt species under reaction conditions.21

In the present study, it will be shown that it is
possible to catalyze
the reaction between CO and NO at a temperature as low as 140 K with
subnanometric Pt clusters stabilized in the pores of zeolite, while
Pt single atoms are inactive. Spectroscopic studies under operando
conditions and electronic structure calculations have allowed the
explanation of the enhanced catalytic activity observed on Pt clusters
at such low temperature values. Notably, NO dissociation is observed
on subnanometric Pt clusters at 140 K, which usually occurs above
473 K.22,23 The unique reactivity of subnanometric Pt
clusters can be understood by the fast reaction of the O atoms formed
by NO dissociation with CO to produce CO2. In the case
of Pt NP, the strong CO adsorption limits the extension of CO oxidation
to CO2, while in the case of a Pt single atom, fast sintering
to the Pt cluster under reaction conditions is observed.

Results and Discussion
Catalyst Preparation and Structure Characterization
Subnanometric Pt species, including single Pt atoms (Pt-SA) and Pt
clusters (Pt-CL) confined in MCM-22 zeolite, were synthesized following
a new strategy,19 where the 12 ring “cups”
(∼0.7 nm) on the surface and the internal supercages (∼0.7
× 1.8 nm) can stabilize those Pt species.24 A different material containing larger Pt nanoparticles
supported on mesoporous MCM-41 (Pt-NP sample) was synthesized by conventional
wetness impregnation, as described in the Experimental
Section. The three samples were characterized by high-angle
annular dark-field high-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy imaging (HAADF-HRSTEM imaging). The Pt-SA sample mostly
contains Pt single atoms together with a small fraction of Pt clusters
with the particle diameter below 0.7 nm (Figure 1a–c). In the Pt-CL sample, subnanometric
Pt clusters with the diameter between 0.2 and 0.7 nm were mainly observed,
as well as a few Pt single atoms (Figure 1d–f). An average atomicity of 13 atoms
was determined by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy
performed on this sample, as presented in our previous work.19 Finally, Pt nanoparticles with the diameter
ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 nm and an average particle size of 2.0 nm
were observed in the Pt-NP sample (Figure 1g–i). According to the above structural
characterizations, these three Pt samples can be suitable model catalysts
for performing a comparative study on the catalytic behavior of single
Pt atoms, Pt clusters, and nanoparticles.

and on the surface of MCM-41. Size distributions of Pt species in
Pt-SA, Pt-CL, and Pt-NP are shown in (c,f,i), respectively.

Catalytic Studies with Combined Infrared-Mass Spectrometry
The catalytic performance of the three Pt samples in the CO + NO
reaction was followed by mass spectrometry (MS) using a coupled IR-MS
system that allows to obtain information of adsorbed species from
the IR spectra acquired under operando conditions and, simultaneously,
to analyze catalyst reactivity (see the experimental details in the
Supporting Information). In order to get information about the elementary
reaction steps taking place on the catalyst surface, studies at low
surface coverage (0.3–2.8%) have been performed. Isotopically
labeled 13CO and 15NO were used as the reactants
for identification of reaction products based on their mass signals.
The production of 13CO2 and 15N2 at 140 and 200 K on Pt-SA, Pt-CL, and Pt-NP samples under
stream conditions are plotted in Figure S1a–c and summarized in Table 1.

The Pt-SA sample was initially inactive at 200 K (Figure S1a). 13CO2 production
was started
to be observed after 172 s, increasing slowly with reaction time. 15N2 formation was only detected in very low amounts
at ∼623 s. The ex situ TEM experiments after the CO + NO reaction
on the Pt-SA sample show that agglomeration of Pt single atoms occurs,
and after 850 s of reaction at 200 K, subnanometric Pt clusters and
Pt nanoparticles around 1 nm are formed (Figure S2). For the Pt-CL sample (Figure S1b), 13CO2 was formed from the beginning of the
reaction at both 140 and 200 K and its production remains stable with
time, while 15N2 evolution appeared delayed
(between 313 and 490 s). Gas-phase production of 15N2 was below the stoichiometric value of 0.5 (i.e., 15N2/13CO2 ≈ 0.2) at both the
temperature values. In contrast, on the Pt-NP sample (Figure S1c), both 13CO2 and 15N2 were already detected in the first
instance of the reaction; while in this case, the 15N2/13CO2 ratio in the products was ∼1.5.
At 200 K, 13CO2 formation rate decreased until
reaching a constant value. The HAADF-HRSTEM images confirmed that
no obvious sintering of Pt species under the present reaction conditions
occurred on either the Pt-CL or the Pt-NP sample (see Figures S3 and S4).

13CO2 production rates on the three samples
at 200 K at the initial reaction time (∼100 s, in red) and
after 700 s of reaction (in black) were plotted together in Figure 2. Pt-CL was initially
almost 4-fold more active toward 13CO2 formation
than the Pt-NP sample. On the other hand, no activity was observed
on the Pt-SA sample at the beginning of the reaction, but after 700
s, its 13CO2 production was close to that of
Pt-CL.

The Pt-SA sample was inactive initially and its activity for CO2 production increases with time on stream.

To get a better understanding of the catalytic
behavior of different
Pt entities at low temperature, the IR spectra of the three samples
acquired under operando conditions at 140 and 200 K were analyzed
in detail (Figure 3a–c). The Fourier transform infrared spectra of the MCM-22
sample without Pt in the presence of 15NO + 13CO at 140 K is shown in Figure S5. IR
bands at ∼2284 and 2166 cm–1 correspond to 13CO2 and 15N2O, respectively,
while bands at 2105 and 2092 cm–1 can be associated
to 13CO adsorbed on Si–OH groups. Moreover, IR bands
associated to 15N2O3 (at 1836 and
1815 cm–1), 15N2O4 (at 1700 cm–1) and nitrates (bands in the 1576–1554
cm–1 range) were also observed.25 In agreement with previous work,26 some NO oxidation may take place inside the pores of MCM-22, but
at a very low extension, because none of these species was detected
in the gas phase by an on-line mass spectrometer. Moreover, the lack
of 13CO2 and 15N2 in the
effluent gas stream confirms the irrelevant role of the MCM-22 zeolite
for the catalytic CO + NO reaction when working at ≤200 K.

Figure 3 IR spectra
in the (2320–1950) cm–1 IR
region and (2030–1400) cm–1 IR region of
the Pt-NP sample in the presence of 13CO + 15NO at 140 K (a,b) and 200 K (c,d). Spectra have been acquired at
different reaction times (TOS), that is, 180, 780, and 1500 s (a,b);
and 240, 600, and 2100 s (c,d).

In the case of the Pt-NP sample (Figure 3), besides the IR bands already
detected
in the MCM-22 sample, additional bands related to 13CO
and 15NO bonded to platinum surface species were observed.
In particular, at 140 K, IR bands at 2281 and 2160 cm–1 can be ascribed to 13CO2 and 15N2O, respectively. Besides, 13CO bonded to
Si–OH (2108 cm–1) and 13CO bonded
to Ptδ+ (2088 cm–1) and Pt0 (2043 cm–1) were also observed (see Figure 3a,b).27 Several types of NOx species can be observed in the IR spectra, including 15NO bonded to Pt0 surface sites (1850 cm–1),2815N2O4 (1710 cm–1), and nitrates (1553 cm–1). Because the sample was reduced in the IR cell before the introduction
of 13CO and 15NO, the presence of Ptδ+ should come from 15NO dissociation on Pt nanoparticles,
where the resultant oxygen atom on the partially oxidized Pt surface
would further react with 13CO to form 13CO2. When increasing the reaction temperature from 140 to 200
K (see Figure 3c,d), 13CO adsorbed on Ptδ+ species is not observed
anymore and the IR bands at 2045 and 1850 cm–1 correspond
to 13CO and 15NO adsorbed on Pt0,
respectively.

Based on the IR spectra acquired on Pt-NP under
operando conditions,
it can be concluded that Pt NPs are partially oxidized by 15NO at 140 K resulting in Ptδ+, and the surface of
the Pt nanoparticles are covered by strongly adsorbed 13CO and 15NO species at both 140 and 200 K. As a consequence
of surface oxidation by NO and the blocking effect from 13CO/15NO adsorption, the amount of surface metallic Pt
sites available for NO dissociation (which has been reported as active
sites for NO dissociation,23,29,30) strongly decreases, resulting in a low catalytic activity, in agreement
with previous studies.31,32

In the case of Pt-CL, the
IR spectra recorded under operando conditions
are similar to those observed in the Pt-free MCM-22 reference sample
(Figure S6). However, in contrary to the
Pt-NP sample, IR bands associated to Pt interacting with 13CO and 15NO species are not observed, indicating either
a weak interaction of these molecules with Pt surface sites or a fast
reaction toward the production of 13CO2 and 15N2. Because both 13CO2 and 15N2 were detected in the effluent gas by a mass
spectrometer, a high reactivity of Pt-CL in the CO + NO reaction is
proposed. In order to study the chemical state of the Pt clusters
under working conditions, the Pt-CL sample was titrated using CO as
the probe molecule after catalytic reaction at 200 K. As shown in Figure S7, Pt0 species (IR band at
2040 cm–1) were detected, indicating that Pt clusters
remain in an active metallic state under reaction conditions, while
the oxygen resulting from 15NO dissociation is transferred
to 13CO to produce 13CO2. In contrast
to the Pt-NP sample, subnanometric Pt clusters in the Pt-CL sample
are less prone to become oxidized at a low temperature because of
the fast reaction between 13CO and the oxygen species generated
from 15NO dissociation.

Finally, in the case of the
Pt-SA sample, IR bands at 2054 and
2076 cm–1 associated to 13CO–Pt0 and 13CO–Ptδ+, respectively,
are observed in the operando IR spectra at 200 K (Figure S8), which is similar to the situation observed in
the Pt-NP sample. This reflects a sintering of single atoms toward
Pt nanoparticles during the reaction, as confirmed from the HAADF-HRSTEM
images shown in Figure S2.

To summarize
the results from operando IR studies, it is clear
that regardless of whether the reaction occurs on Pt clusters or Pt
nanoparticles, 15NO dissociation can occur at a low temperature
(140–200 K), leading to the formation of O species on the surface
of Pt. However, while the O species on Pt clusters react fast with 13CO to form CO2 and to maintain the Pt clusters
in the metallic state, the much stronger interaction of CO with the
Pt atoms in the Pt nanoparticles decreases the rate of the CO + O
reaction, resulting in partial oxidation of the nanoparticles. Therefore,
the low temperature CO + NO reaction can proceed smoothly on Pt clusters
while Pt nanoparticles show lower activity.

Computational Studies
To understand the reaction mechanism
of low-temperature CO + NO reaction on Pt species with different particle
sizes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with four clusters
of different atomicity, Pt4, Pt10, Pt13, and Pt38, were considered, together with a periodic
model for a Pt atom placed in the cavity of MCM-22, and a slab model
of the Pt(111) surface to represent large nanoparticles (see Figures 4 and S9). The zeolite support was considered in the
model of the Pt atom to confirm, as will be discussed later, that
isolated Pt atoms in MCM-22 zeolite are not stable under reaction
conditions and sinter forming clusters. Then, to analyze the influence
of cluster atomicity on the bond-breaking and bond-forming steps of
the mechanism, which take place when the molecules are already adsorbed
on the Pt clusters, the zeolite support was not considered necessary.

as light blue, dark blue, and red balls, respectively.

The following elementary steps in the mechanism
of the CO + NO
reaction were considered 1   2   3   4   5  

Equations 1 and 2 refer to the adsorption
of reactants and (3) is the dissociation of
NO yielding atomic species. Equation 4 represents the reaction
of CO with atomic O forming the CO2 product, and (5) corresponds to the recombination of atomic N forming
N2. In addition, alternative pathways in which NO and CO
react molecularly (6), or in which atomic N*
reacts with CO to form NCO (7) or with NO to
form N2O (8) that subsequently reacts
with CO yielding the N2 and CO2 products (9) were computationally investigated over each of
the catalyst models, and only the most relevant results are described
in detail. 6   7   8   9  

Adsorption of only one CO or NO molecule
on a Pt atom stabilized
in the MCM-22 zeolite model is clearly exothermic, with calculated
adsorption energies of −95 and −79 kcal mol–1, respectively, and lead to the formation of a complex with a linear
arrangement of the framework O, the Pt atom, and the C or N atom in
CO or NO molecules (see Figure S9). However,
co-adsorption of two molecules on the same Pt atom, forming di-carbonyl,
di-nitrosyl, or a Pt–CO–NO complex, would weaken the
interaction between the Pt atom and the framework O atoms. As a result,
the linear unit containing the Pt atom and the CO and NO molecules
would move to the center of the cavity of MCM-22. Aggregation of two
such units is clearly exothermic and would explain the formation of
clusters observed by STEM in the Pt-SA sample under reaction conditions.
On the other hand, the products of NO dissociation over a Pt atom
in MCM-22 zeolite are more than 60 kcal mol–1 higher
in energy than the corresponding initial reactant, which would explain
the initial lack of activity of the Pt-SA sample and confirm the previous
hypothesis that Pt nanoclusters formed by agglomeration of Pt atoms
are the working active species for the low-temperature CO + NO reaction.

In the case of subnanometric Pt clusters and Pt nanoparticles,
CO preferentially adsorbs on top of low coordinated Pt atoms or in
bridge positions between two Pt atoms, in agreement with previous
studies,33−36 while NO forms a larger variety of complexes, as shown in Figures
S10–S14 in the Supporting Information. However, only some of these adsorption complexes, in particular,
bidentate species in which both N and O atoms are directly coordinated
to Pt, lead to an adequate activation of the NO molecule and its dissociation.
The optimized structures of reactant R(3), transition state
TS(3), and product P(3) involved in the unimolecular
dissociation of NO over Pt clusters and nanoparticles are depicted
in Figure 4, with the
corresponding activation and reaction energies being summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

While in the most stable adsorption modes, NO interacts
with Pt
only through the N atom forming one, two, or three Pt–N bonds
(structures R(3) in Figure 4), consistent with previous studies,34,36−40 less stable conformations (structures R(3)′ in Figure 4) in which O also interacts with Pt are always
involved in the pathways for N–O bond dissociation. Such adsorption
modes facilitate the transfer of electron density from the metal to
the antibonding 2π* orbital of NO, thus weakening the N–O
bond and producing an elongation of the optimized NO distance from
1.17 Å in the gas phase to 1.21, 1.29, 1.32, and 1.34 and 1.25
Å on Pt4, Pt10, Pt13, and Pt38, and Pt(111) models, respectively. In fact, an excellent
linear correlation is obtained when activation energies for NO dissociation
versus optimized NO distance in reactant structure R(3)′ are plotted (Figure S15). Moreover, in this conformation,
both O and N atoms are stabilized by the Pt surface in the transition
states TS(3). Altogether, low activation energy barriers
are obtained for Pt13 and Pt38 clusters when
calculated with respect to R(3)′ (Eact values
in parenthesis in Table 2), while significantly higher values are found both on too small
Pt4 clusters and on the Pt(111) surface. Previous computational
studies using Pt(100) and the stepped Pt(211), Pt(410), or Pt(533)
surfaces as catalyst models have shown that NO decomposition is favored
not only by the presence of defects but also especially by the local
arrangement of the Pt atoms at the defect sites.32,37,41 The highest reactivity was obtained on ensembles
of four Pt atoms forming a square, an arrangement equivalent to that
present in the Pt38 model that also leads to the lowest
activation energy in the present work. The catalytic activity observed
in the Pt-NP sample (see Figure 2) can probably be attributed to step defects on the
surface.

It should be noted that when the Eact values are calculated with respect to the most stable
adsorption
complex R(3), (values in Table 2) the trend in the activation energies does
not change, and intermediate Pt13 and Pt38 clusters
are the most reactive. This trend is in excellent agreement with the
IR operando results showing faster 15NO decomposition on
Pt-CL as compared to Pt-NP. The reaction energies calculated with
respect to the most stable R(3) system (Erea values in Table 3) indicate that this step is exothermic only for Pt38 and slightly endothermic for Pt10 and the Pt(111)
surface model.

The second elementary step in the mechanism is
the reaction of
CO with adsorbed O atoms to form CO2, step (4). In the
reactant structure R(4), (see Figure 5 for all steps in the Pt13 cluster
and Figure S16 for step 4 in all the catalyst
models) CO adsorbs on a Pt atom close to an O atom that adopts bridge
positions in the smaller clusters and prefers tri-coordinated sites
with increasing particle size, consistent with previous studies.33,35,42,43 Then, through a transition state structure TS(4), in
which the O atom breaks one of the bonds with Pt while forms a new
one with C, the product P(4) corresponding to a bent CO2 molecule with a strong C–Pt bond is obtained. The
activation energies, between 13 and 20 kcal mol–1, are lower than those previously obtained for NO dissociation (Table 2), indicating that
the reaction of CO with adsorbed O is not the rate-determining step
of the process. The calculated reaction energies indicate that this
step is almost thermoneutral for all Pt catalyst models considered
(Table 3).

atoms are depicted as light blue, dark blue, orange, and red balls,
respectively.

An alternative pathway involving the direct reaction
of co-adsorbed
NO and CO to produce, in one step, CO2 and atomic N was
also considered, as described in step (6). Starting from one CO and
one NO molecule adsorbed close in stable conformations (structures
labelled R(6) in Figures 5 and S17), transition states
TS(6) were obtained in which the O atom of NO attacks the
C atom of CO, forming a N–O–C–O system with strong
interaction with Pt. The activation barriers for this processes are
high, being close to 80 kcal mol–1 on the smallest
Pt4 cluster, around 50 kcal mol–1 on
the rest of the clusters, and almost 40 kcal mol–1 on the Pt(111) model (Table 2).The calculated reaction energies indicate that this step
becomes more thermodynamically favorable as the Pt particle size increases.
In any case, except for the perfect Pt(111) surface, the calculated
activation energies for step (6) are clearly higher than those previously
obtained for the monomolecular NO dissociation according to (3), especially
for Pt13 and Pt38 clusters, suggesting a low
contribution of the bimolecular pathway to the activation and dissociation
of NO over Pt catalysts.

To further clarify this point, the
following experiments were performed
in our coupled IR-MS system. Pt-CL and Pt-NP samples were exposed
to 15NO at 140 K for 30 min, followed by evacuation at
10–5 mbar and annealing in vacuum at 213 K, until
no IR bands associated with any adsorbed 15NO species were
observed in the IR spectra. Then, the samples were cooled down to
140 K and subsequently exposed to 13CO. As clearly seen
in Figure S18, 13CO2 was immediately formed on both Pt-CL and Pt-NP samples, thus demonstrating
that the presence of adsorbed O atoms unambiguously arises from 15NO dissociation and can further react with 13CO
to form 13CO2. These experiments confirm, on
the one hand, the contribution of the NO dissociative pathway in the
reaction mechanism and, on the other hand, that reaction of 13CO with atomic O to form 13CO2 is not the rate-determining
step in the global reaction mechanism. Moreover, 13CO2 formation on the Pt-NP sample was found to be ∼5-fold
lower than on the Pt-CL sample, indicating a lower concentration of
adsorbed O atoms on the Pt-NP, in agreement with the higher activation
barrier for NO dissociation obtained on the Pt(111) model. To our
knowledge, this is the first time where NO dissociation at such a
low temperature has been directly observed on metal catalysts.

The last step in the global mechanism is the recombination of two
adsorbed N atoms to form N2 and then desorption from the
catalyst, as described by eq 5. The optimized structures of the species involved in this
elementary step are depicted in Figures 5 and S19. In all
the cases, N atoms preferentially occupy distant 3-fold positions
(bridge in the case of Pt4) on the Pt cluster or nanoparticle
surface, structures labelled R(5), and they have to become
closer and move to bridge positions, structures labelled R(5)′, in order
to start the recombination process. The calculated activation energy
over the smallest Pt4 cluster is much lower than that found
for NO dissociation, step (3), no matter whether it is related to
minimum R(5) or R(5)′. On the other catalyst models, however,
the activation barriers for N2 formation are comparable
to those obtained for NO dissociation, slightly lower on Pt10 and Pt13 clusters, higher on Pt38 model, and
nearly the same on Pt(111) surface (Table 2), this last value being in excellent agreement
with previous reports.41,44 However, in contrast to NO dissociation,
the N2 formation step is clearly exothermic for all catalyst
models considered (Table 3).

It should be noted at this point that all the discussion
is based
on electronic energies, which are expected to describe correctly the
bond-breaking and bond-forming steps investigated but do not include
entropy effects nor dispersion interactions. To check the influence
of these two factors, Gibbs free energies at 200 K and dispersion
corrections using the Grimme’s method have been calculated
for the main steps of the mechanism on the most relevant Pt13, Pt38, and Pt(111) models, and the values are summarized
in Tables S1–S3 in the Supporting Information. The Gibbs free energy values obtained for Pt13 and Pt38 models differ by less than 1 kcal mol–1 from the electronic energies discussed in the manuscript, and this
difference remains below 2 kcal mol–1 on the Pt(111)
surface. This small difference is not surprising taking into account
the low reaction temperature studied and therefore the low values
of the RT and TS terms. Dispersion corrections lead to slightly larger
changes in the relative electronic and Gibbs free energies, but still
in the 0–5 kcal mol–1 range except in a few
particular cases in which the reaction involves desorption of atoms
from the particle. None of these changes modify the trends and conclusions
obtained, supporting our initial assumption that electronic energies
describe correctly the reactivity of Pt clusters and particles.

Taking into account the experimentally observed delay in the production
of 15N2 on the Pt-CL sample (see the catalytic
results presented in Figure S1), and the
fact that gas-phase production of 15N2 is below
the stoichiometric value, it seems that N2 recombination
and desorption is the rate-determining step of the global process.
To prove that point, we carried out a N2-desorption experiment
with the Pt-CL sample. First, the Pt-CL sample was exposed to 15NO at 140 K for 30 min, then evacuated at 10–5 mbar, and annealed in vacuum up to 213 K. Afterward, the Pt-CL sample
was again cooled down to 140 K and exposed to an Argon flow. Then,
the temperature was gradually increased with a rate of 2 K min–1 and gas-phase species were analyzed by mass spectrometry.
As shown in Figure 6, 15N2 evolution was observed at 240 K, indicating
that a slow N2 recombination should be responsible for
the observed delay in the 15N2 production on
the Pt-CL sample.

Figure 6 15N2 desorption in the Pt-CL sample
after
being exposed to 15NO at 140 K for 30 min, evacuated at
10–5 mbar, and annealed under vacuum up to 213 K,
was again cooled down to 140 K and exposed to an argon flow.

According to the pathway proposed by DFT, it is
key to force N
atoms to become closer in order to recombine into N2, and
a possible way to achieve that is increasing the surface coverage
of adsorbed N* species. To check this point, additional calculations
were performed for step (5) on Pt13, Pt38, and
Pt(111) catalyst models with a higher N* coverage (Figure S20). As expected, the presence of other N species
adsorbed close to the N atoms on the Pt catalysts forces them to leave
the stable 3-fold positions and approach to each other, leading to
a significant decrease in the calculated activation energies and to
a clear enhancement of the exothermicity of the process (see Tables 2 and 3).

To further confirm this hypothesis, another experiment
was performed
in our coupled IR-MS system in which the CO + NO reaction was carried
out on the Pt-CL sample at 200 K with an increased total pressure
from 1.4 to 2.2 mbar and modified 13CO/15NO
molar ratio in the feed gas. Increasing the total pressure should
enhance 15N2 desorption from Pt clusters, thus
leaving more Pt sites available for 15NO adsorption and
dissociation, with a corresponding promotion effect on the catalytic
activity. In addition, modifying the 13CO/15NO molar ratio may influence the reaction rates for other elementary
steps, including the NO dissociation, reaction between O and CO, and
the N* recombination reaction to N2. As shown in Table 4 and Figure S21, by increasing the total pressure from 1.4 to ∼2.2
mbar, both 13CO2 formation and 15N2 desorption are enhanced. On the other hand, increasing
the 13CO partial pressure enhances 15N2 desorption and also promotes accordingly the production of 13CO2 despite the lower 15NO partial
pressure. These results indicate that adsorbed N* species on the surface
of Pt clusters may suppress the catalytic activity of the Pt-CL catalyst.
In other words, the recombination of adsorb N* species is a key step
in the low-temperature CO + NO reaction. Therefore, a maxima 13CO2 formation rate was obtained at a 13CO/15NO molar ratio of ∼3.

Because the catalyst surface becomes covered by atomic
N in the
first stage of the CO + NO reaction, we have considered the possibility
that adsorbed N atoms could react with CO yielding NCO (see eq 7) or with NO to produce
N2O (see eq 8) (see the optimized structures involved in these steps in Figures 5, S22 and S23). The activation energies for the reaction of
CO with adsorbed N atoms are 15–20 kcal mol–1 higher than those previously reported for the reaction of CO with
adsorbed O yielding CO2 (Table 2), and the reaction energies are positive
in all the cases (Table 3), suggesting that formation of NCO will only occur in the absence
of atomic O on the catalyst surface. In contrast, comparison of the
activation and reaction energies obtained for NO reaction with N atoms
with those calculated for NO dissociation according to eq 3 suggests that N2O formation
will be competitive on all the Pt cluster models containing adsorbed
N*. In fact, N2O is observed in the operando IR study on
all samples.

N2O formed on the Pt clusters could
further react with
CO producing CO2 according to eq 9. The process occurs, over all Pt cluster
models, through a similar cyclic transition state in which the O atom
of N2O attacks the CO carbon atom bonded to one Pt site,
while the terminal N atom of N2O is attached to an adjacent
Pt atom (Figure S24). The activation energies,
around 30 kcal mol–1, are only slightly higher than
those involved in the formation of N2O, and the step is
clearly exothermic for all clusters with different sizes. Thus, the
pathway involving the formation of N2O according to (8) and its subsequent reaction with CO as described
by (9) could also contribute to the overall
reaction.

Therefore, according to DFT calculations, it can be
concluded that
single atoms, very small clusters, and too large nanoparticles cannot
dissociate the NO molecule either mono-molecularly (3) or by direct reaction with CO (6),
whereas medium-sized clusters can, with the monomolecular pathway
being preferred. In addition, for the active medium-sized clusters,
it is found that the rate-determining step of the CO + NO reaction
is the formation of N2 via recombination of the adsorbed
N* atoms produced in the dissociation of NO (5) and that N2O formation (8) and
its reaction with CO (9) is competitive and
might also contribute to the global reaction. All of these conclusions
are consistent with the experimental results previously presented.

Conclusions
We have shown that, CO + NO reaction to
produce CO2 and
N2 can occur on stabilized subnanometric Pt clusters at
a low temperature as low as 140 K. Then, combining operando IR spectroscopy
experiments and DFT calculations, we have studied the low-temperature
CO + NO reaction on different types of Pt species from single Pt atoms
to subnanometric Pt clusters and nanoparticles. A reaction mechanism
involving NO dissociation, CO oxidation by O*, and N* recombination
followed by N2 desorption has been proposed. NO dissociation
takes place on both Pt clusters and nanoparticles while it is not
favored on Pt atoms. Singly dispersed Pt atoms are not stable under
reaction conditions and agglomerate into Pt clusters. Because of their
different redox properties, the oxidized Pt species in the Pt-CL sample
can be reduced by CO to produce CO2. In the case of Pt-NP,
the oxidation of CO to CO2 occurs in a much lower extension
because of the strong interaction of Pt with CO and NO that remain
adsorbed on the nanoparticles. Altogether, only Pt clusters allow
NO dissociation and CO oxidation to occur well on the surface, while
CO interaction is weak enough to avoid catalyst poisoning, resulting
in enhanced catalytic performance. Because of the different interaction
of the single atoms, clusters and nanoparticles with the reactions
(CO and NO), subnanometric Pt clusters exhibit the best catalytic
performance for low-temperature CO + NO reaction, being one example
showing how the unique electronic and geometric structures of subnanometric
metal clusters lead to remarkable catalytic properties compared to
the corresponding single atoms and nanoparticles.

Experimental Section
Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization
The Pt-SA sample
was prepared according to the method reported in the literature.12 Pure-silica MCM-22 (0.97 g) was dried in an
oven at 135 °C for 4 h. Trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum(IV)
(26 mg) was dissolved in 26 mL of pentane and then mixed with the
dried pure-silica MCM-22 powder. After being stirred for 2 h at room
temperature, the solid sample was separated by filtration and washed
with pentane. The resultant solid sample was kept in a sealed vial.
The loading of Pt in the Pt-SA sample was 0.20 wt %, determined by
inductively coupled plasma (ICP).

The Pt-CL sample was prepared
according to our previous work.19 Subnanometric
Pt clusters were introduced to pure-silica MCM-22 zeolite during the
transformation of two-dimensional pure-silica ITQ-1 into three-dimensional
MCM-22 zeolite. The loading of Pt is 0.10 wt %, determined by ICP.

The Pt-NP sample was prepared by conventional wetness impregnation.
MCM-41 (pure silica, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich) (1.0 g) was dispersed
in the aqueous solution of H2PtCl6. After the
removal of water at 110 °C, the solid product was reduced by
H2 first at 200 °C for 2 h and then at 500 °C
for 3 h. The loading of Pt in the Pt-NP sample was 0.85 wt %, determined
by ICP.

The particle size distribution of three Pt samples was
studied
by electron microscopy. Samples for electron microscopy studies were
prepared by dropping the suspension of the solid sample using ethanol
as the solvent directly onto holey-carbon-coated Cu grids. The measurements
were performed in a JEOL 2100F microscope operating at 200 kV both
in transmission (TEM) and STEM. STEM images were obtained using a
HAADF detector (HAADF), which allows Z-contrast imaging. High-resolution
STEM measurement was performed on a FEI Titan low-base microscope
at 300 kV equipped with a Cs probe corrector, a monochromator, and
an ultrabright X-FEG electron source. The convergence angle was 25
mrad and the inner and outer angles for HAADF imaging were 70 and
200 mrad, respectively. Control experiments have been performed and
it was found that, under our experimental conditions, the subnanometric
Pt species remain stable under the electron beam in the first several
acquisitions.

Operando IR Studies
An Infrared catalytic cell (home-made)
connected by a 1/16 capillary to a Balzer mass spectrometer has been
used for the operando IR-MS studies. The IR cell is connected to a
vacuum system with gas dosing facilities and allows in situ treatment
in controlled atmospheres and temperatures from 103 to 773 K. For
the IR study, ∼10 mg of the sample was pressed into a thin
pellet and located inside the IR cell. Pt-NP were activated in situ
under H2 flow at 350 °C for 1 h followed by vacuum
treatment (∼10–5 mbar) at the same temperature
for 45 min. Pt-CL and Pt-SA were in situ activated under vacuum (∼10–5 mbar) at 250 °C for 1.5 h. After activation,
the sample temperature was decreased to the reaction temperature (140
and 200 K) under vacuum. Once achieved the reaction temperature, the
sample is exposed to a continuous flow of 13CO + 15NO (1:1 molar ratio) at a rate of 0.1 mmol/h. The pressure in the
catalytic IR cell was constant during the time of the experiment that
settled to 1.4 mbar. Additional experiments were performed at higher
reaction pressures, that is, ∼2.2 mbar and varying the 13CO/15NO molar ratio from 0.36 to 2.75. The reaction
products were followed by on line mass spectrometry in the multi-ion
mode following the subsequent m/z fragmentation values, that is, 29 (13CO), 31 (15NO), 45 (13CO2), 30 (15N2), 47 (15N2O), 76 (15N2O3), 94 (15N2O4), 47
(15NO2). Blank experiments were done under similar
reaction conditions in absence of the catalyst, resulting in no catalytic
activity. For quantitative analysis, the value of each m/z mass was corrected taking into consideration
the contribution of the rest of the products to the selected fragmentation
and converted from mA to mol according to the calibration done for
each product.

Computational Details
All calculations in this work
are based on the periodic DFT and were carried out using the Perdew–Wang
(PW91) functional45 as implemented in the
Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).46,47 The valence density was expanded in a plane wave basis set with
a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV, and the effect of the core electrons
in the valence density was taken into account by means of the projected
augmented wave formalism.48 The Pt(111)
surface was simulated by means of a 3 × 3 supercell slab model
consisting of 45 Pt atoms arranged in five atomic layers and separated
by a vacuum region of 15 Å to avoid interaction between periodically
repeated slabs. Integration in the reciprocal space was carried out
using a 3 × 3 × 1 mesh of Monkhorst–Pack49k-points, and during the geometry
optimizations, the positions of the adsorbates and of the Pt atoms
of the two uppermost layers were allowed to fully relax. The Pt4, Pt10, Pt13, and Pt38 cluster
models, as well as the reactant and product molecules, were placed
in a 20 × 20 × 20 Å3 cubic box, large enough
to avoid spurious interactions between periodically repeated systems.
Integration in the reciprocal space was carried out at the Γ k-point of the Brillouin zone, and the positions of all
the atoms in these systems were fully optimized without any restriction.
Finally, the Pt single atoms in MCM-22 were modeled by placing a Pt
atom in the large cage of a pure silica model of the MWW crystalline
structure, with lattice parameters a = b = 14.390 and c = 25.198 Å and containing 216
atoms in the conventional unit cell (72 T and 144 O). Integration
in the reciprocal space was carried out at the Γ k-point of the Brillouin zone, and the positions of all the atoms
in this model were fully optimized without restrictions.

All
calculations are spin-polarized, and all stationary points were characterized
by partial hessian frequency calculations in which the Pt atoms of
the catalyst model were kept fixed. Transition states were located
using the DIMER50,51 or CI-NEB52 algorithms. The jmol53 and MOLDEN54 programs were used to build and visualize the
systems and their frequencies throughout the work. Dispersion corrections
to the energies were evaluated using the D3 Grimme’s method.55,56 The absolute Gibbs free energies of all species are given by  where Etot is
the electronic energy obtained from the DFT calculation, EZPE is the zero point energy correction, Evib is the vibrational thermal energy contribution, and Svib is the vibrational entropy. The vibrational
contributions to the energy and entropy were calculated according
to      using the vibrational frequencies υ
obtained from the DFT calculations.
