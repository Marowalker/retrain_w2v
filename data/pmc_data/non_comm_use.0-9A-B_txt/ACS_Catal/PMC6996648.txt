Comprehensive mechanistic insights into the activity
of different
catalysts based on different ligands are important for further ligand
design and catalyst improvement. Herein, we report a combined computational
and experimental study on the mechanism and catalytic activity of
the ylide-substituted phosphine Cy3P–C(Me)PCy2 (keYPhos, L1) in C–N coupling reactions
including a comparison with the established and often-applied phosphines CyJohnPhos (L2) and P(tBu)3 (L3). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
together with the possible isolation of several intermediates within
the catalytic cycle demonstrate that L1 readily forms
low-coordinated palladium complexes [such as L1·Pd(dba)], which easily undergo oxidative addition and subsequent amine coordination
as well as reductive elimination. Due to the possible opening and
closing of the P–C–P angle in L1, the steric
bulk can be adjusted to the metal environment so that L1 retains its conformation throughout the whole catalytic cycle, thus
leading to fast catalysis at room temperature. Comparative studies
of the three ligands with Pd2dba3 as a Pd source
show that only L1 efficiently allows for the coupling
of aryl chlorides at room temperature. DFT studies suggest that this
is mainly due to the reluctance/inability of L2 and L3 to form the catalytically active species under these reaction
conditions. In contrast, the YPhos ligand readily forms the prereactive
complex and undergoes the first oxidative addition reaction. These
observations are confirmed by kinetic studies, which indicate a short
induction period for the formation of the catalytically active species
of L1, followed by fast catalysis. This behavior of L1 is due to its unique electronic and steric properties,
which support low activation barriers and fast catalyst generation.

Introduction
The palladium-catalyzed formation of carbon–nitrogen
bonds
has grown to a mature method in modern organic synthesis for the preparation
of complex molecules.1 Due to the ubiquitous
presence of amine functionalities in many agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals,
and building blocks in material sciences and other fields of chemistry,
it is nowadays used as a valuable tool not only in academia but also
in industry. Since the ground-breaking reports by Hartwig and Buchwald
in the 1990s,2 many improvements have been
made, often based on the development of new types of ligands and precatalysts.
The most important ligand class in Buchwald–Hartwig aminations
(BHA) are phosphines. Prominent examples are bidentate phosphines
like 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl (BINAP)
or 1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf),3 bulky di- or trialkylphosphines such as Beller’s
cataCXium A4 and tris(tert-butyl)phosphine5 as well as Buchwald’s
biaryl phosphines or the DalPhos ligands by Stradiotto.6 Particularly, the class of biaryl phosphines
has been developed into a library of customized ligands, which master
the different demands of different substrates and reaction conditions.
This has for example led to the design of ligands that allow reactions under
mild conditions or the coupling ofdifficult, such as sterically
demanding substrates.7

Although many
new phosphine ligands are reported each year to further
improve the catalytic activity, only a few can compete with the highly
elaborated, established ligand systems. However, we recently reported
on a new class of phosphine ligands, the ylide-substituted phosphines
(YPhos), formed by incorporation of an ylide moiety at the phosphorus
center.8 Without elaborate ligand optimization,
these YPhos ligands exhibited unprecedented reactivities in catalysis.9 In general, YPhos ligands are highly electron-rich
phosphines due to the strong electron donation from the ylide substituent
to the phosphorus center. This strong donor property is beneficial
for the formation of highly efficient catalysts for numerous different
transformations. For example, without tedious optimizations of the
ligand design, YPhos ligand CyYMePCy2 (keYPhos, L1, Figure 1) together with Pd2dba3 or Pd(OAc)2 as metal sources exhibited remarkably high activities in
the amination of aryl chlorides at room temperature (RT). Also, difficult,
sterically bulky substrates were coupled within mostly a 1 h reaction
time.9

Figure 1 Stabilizing interactions in L·Pd
species with L1–L3.

To further improve the design of the YPhos ligands
for palladium
catalysis, we became interested in the origin of this remarkable activity.
In our initial report, we suggested that the unusual activity of L1 can be attributed to two factors: (i) the strong donor
ability of the ligand [TEP(L1) = 2050.1 cm–1]9 and (ii) a weak agostic C–H···Pd
interaction in the active Pd(0) species, which stabilizes the Pd(0)
complexes and thus facilitates the formation of monoligated Pd species.
To gain further insights into the role and behavior of the ligand
in the catalytic cycle and to understand the high activity of L1, we addressed mechanistic studies of the C–N cross-coupling
reaction with L1. We were particularly interested in
the coordination behavior of L1 toward palladium in the
different complexes formed during catalysis to establish a structure–activity
relationship and to facilitate further ligand improvements. Furthermore,
a comparative study with established ligands [CyJohnPhos
(L2), tBu3P (L3)] was carried out to single out the importance of the different
ligand architectures and stabilizing ligand–metal interactions
for the different catalytic activities (Figure 1).9

Results and Discussion
Comparative Catalytic Studies
Preliminary studies indicated
a considerably higher activity of palladium catalysts based on L1 after a 1 h reaction time compared to catalysts prepared
with CyJohnPhos (L2) and tBu3P (L3).9 To
further probe the different activities, we carried out more detailed
studies on the progress of the reaction. We chose chlorobenzene, p-chlorotoluene, and p-chlorofluorobenzene
as aryl halides together with piperidine as an amine to also probe
the impact of different aryl chlorides. All reactions were carried
out under the exact same reaction conditions including a preactivation
time of 30 min for the catalyst formation from the free ligand and
Pd2dba3 prior to the addition of the reagents.

As shown in Table 1, the performance of L1 significantly surpasses that
observed for L2 and L3. For all aryl chlorides,
full conversion was observed with the YPhos ligand after only a 2
h reaction time. In contrast, only minor amounts of product were formed
with L2 and L3 even after a 6 h reaction
time. This surprisingly strong difference in activity led us to look
more closely into the mechanism of the BHA with L1 and differences compared to L2 and L3.

Structures of Pd(0) Complexes with L1: the Catalytically
Active Species
We began our studies with the elucidation
and characterization of catalytically active Pd(0) complexes with L1. In our initial publication, we reported on the isolation
of the monophosphine complex L1·Pd(dba) formed by
the addition of Pd2(dba)3 to a solution of L1 in THF.9 This complex exhibited
a short C–H···Pd distance, which, together with
computational methods, suggested the presence of an agostic interaction
(Figure 2). Stability
tests showed that this species slowly decomposes in THF solution,
forming Pd black and the free phosphine ligand. The first signs of
decomposition were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum within
24 h in THF.

To gain more information about the coordination
behavior of L1 toward Pd(0), the synthesis of a bisphosphine
complex was
performed. While the reaction of L1 with Pd2(dba)3 in a 1:1 metal to ligand ratio selectively led
to L1·Pd(dba), the use of 2 equiv of ligand resulted
in the formation of the desired bisphosphine complex L12·Pd in THF solution at room temperature. However,
no full conversion to L12·Pd was observed
under these reaction conditions. Significant amounts (more than 50%)
of L1·Pd(dba) together with the free phosphine were
still present in solution even after a prolonged reaction time [see Figure S1, Supporting Information (SI)]. Fortunately,
small amounts of L12·Pd precipitated
directly from the reaction mixture as a colorless crystalline solid.
Thus, the complex could be identified by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography (Figure 2). Alternatively, L12·Pd can also be prepared from (TMEDA)PdMe2 and 2 equiv L1 (see SI). The bisphosphine complex
is stable in the solid state for months, but, similar to the dibenzylideneacetone
(dba) complex, exhibits limited stability in solution, which, together
with the low solubility, prevented its full characterization. The
Pd–P distances in L12·Pd amount
to 2.3247(6) and 2.3382(5) Å and are thus comparable to the one
found in the dba complex [2.3318(9) Å], but longer compared to
other bisphosphine complexes,10 e.g., 2.265(2)
Å in Pd[P(iPr)(tBu)2]211 or 2.285(3) Å in
Pd(PtBu3)2.12 The observed bond elongation is most probably caused by
the steric bulk of the ligand and is necessary to allow for the accommodation
of both ligands at a single Pd center.

The formation of the
bisphosphine complex is rather surprising
since the buried volume of the ligand derived from the gold(I) complex L1·AuCl was calculated to be 49%, which is larger than
the one reported for most of the phosphine ligands in the literature.13 Thus, the two ligands barely fit around the
metal center. The fact that L12·Pd can
still be formed at room temperature can be explained by the unique
architecture of the YPhos ligand. The ylide moiety in the ligand is
more flexible than structures solely based on rigid aryl groups. Particularly,
the P–C–P angle varies significantly and thus adjusts
to the spatial demand of the metal and its coligands. For example,
in the case of L12·Pd, the P–C–P
angle amounts to 125.7(1)°, while an angle of 119.1(2)°
is observed in the free ligand and 117.4(3)° in L1·Pd(dba). The smaller angle in the dba complex results in a stronger shielding
of the metal center by L1 than in the bisphosphine complex
and can be rationalized by the different bulk of dba and L1.

As shown in Figure 2, the Pd–H distance to the PCy3 moiety considerably
elongates in the bisphosphine complex (2.52(3) Å; Pd–C:
3.490(1) Å) compared to L1·Pd(dba) [Pd–H:
2.09(1); Pd–C: 3.010(2) Å], thus suggesting a weakening
of the agostic interaction in L12·Pd.
Nonetheless, the distance is still in the range of other reported
agostic interactions in palladium–phosphine complexes.14 This is confirmed by computational studies [PBE0-D3/def2svp//def2tzvp
+ LANL2TZ(f) with THF as a solvent]. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules
(QTAIM) calculations yields bond-critical points for the Pd–H
interaction for both complexes, whereas the calculated electron density
at the bond-critical point (BCP) is considerably higher in the case
of the dba complex [q(BCP) = 0.044] than in L12·Pd [q(BCP) = 0.018—two
BCPs present]. This is also in line with the natural bond orbital
(NBO) analyses and the calculated Wiberg bond indices (see Table S10, SI). The weaker agostic interaction
in L12·Pd probably results from steric
congestions in the complex. The widening of the P–C–P
angle in the ylide substituent (vide supra) ultimately leads to a
larger distance between the PCy3 moiety and the metal and
thus to a weaker C–H···Pd interaction. Hence,
the molecular structures and computational studies demonstrate that
the agostic interaction in the YPhos–palladium complexes is
strongly sensitive to steric influences. It is noteworthy that there
is a Pd–H interaction in L12·Pd, while none is found in Pd(PtBu3)2 (L32·Pd). This is mainly due to the different geometries of the two ligands.
In case of the δ-agostic interaction with the YPhos ligand,
the hydrogen of the cyclohexyl moiety directly points toward the palladium
center. Thus, an almost linear C–H–Pd interaction [159(2)°]
is observed in L12·Pd. In contrast, the
CH3 protons in L32·Pd point away from the metal [cf. crystal structures
with P(tBu)3–nRn],11,12 resulting
in a rather bent C–H–Pd interaction (approx. 120°
for L32·Pd).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations [PBE0-D3/def2svp//def2tzvp
+ LANL2TZ(f), polarizable continuum model (PCM) model with THF as
a solvent] show that the bisphosphine complex L12·Pd is thermodynamically more stable than the dba complex L1·Pd(dba) (ΔΔG = 38 kJ·mol–1). In the experiment, the formation of the complexes
can be controlled by the ligand/metal ratio. Exclusive formation of L1·Pd(dba) is found in solution when employing a 1:1
ratio. Since this ratio is used in catalysis,9 we assume that L1·Pd(dba) is the most dominant
species for entering the catalytic cycle at the beginning of the catalysis
and the formation of the catalytically active species. The fact that
a monophosphine species is the active species is further supported
by the observation that isolated L12·Pd is catalytically incompetent. No product formation was observed
for the coupling of 4-chlorotoluene or 4-fluorochlorobenezene with
piperidine under the same reaction conditions as described above (Table 1). This clearly shows
that L12·Pd is not an active species
and thus not (or only  a minor side-product) formed during catalysis.
This is further confirmed by the fact that excessive phosphine is
needed to quench the activity of L1 with Pd2dba3. In the coupling of 4-chlorotoluene with piperidine,
only a minor loss of activity is observed when using 2 equiv L1 (Table 2), since C–N coupling is faster than L12·Pd formation. With 0.25 mol % of Pd2dba3, full
conversion is observed with a 1:1 metal ligand ratio after only a
30 min reaction time, while 94% conversion was achieved with double
the amount of ligand. With 4 equiv L1, a further drop
in activity is found, which suggests the formation of inactive L12·Pd and hence
reduction of the catalyst concentration under these conditions. Overall,
these data demonstrate that oxidative addition (OA) of the aryl halide
occurs at a monoligated palladium complex, which is also in line with
kinetic studies by Hartwig and co-workers on bulky trialkylphosphines15 as well as computational studies such as those
by Barder and Buchwald,16 Norrby,17 and others.18

In Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions, monophosphine
species of type
R3P·Pd are often supposed to be the catalytically
active species. With L1, however, the “naked”
monoligated complex L1·Pd is by far less stable
than L1·Pd(dba) (ΔΔG = 127 kJ·mol–1) or L12·Pd (ΔΔG = 165 kJ·mol–1), making it unlikely that L1·Pd is on the reaction path.19 Instead, it is more likely that under catalytic conditions, the
dba ligand is replaced via an associative mechanism directly by the
haloarene to form the prereactive arene complex 1. Analogous
Pd(0)–arene complexes have also been proposed for other phosphine
ligands.20 Based on the calculated energies,
it is likely that L1·Pd(ArCl) (1) is
the actual active species from which the catalytic cycle starts.17 The prereactive complex 1 with
chlorobenzene as an electrophile is also higher in energy than the
dba complex (ΔΔG = 77 kJ·mol–1). However, with the large excess of substrate under
catalysis conditions, it should be easily accessible. Applying corrections
for the concentrations used in the experiment (0.5 mol % catalyst)
decreases the preference of L1·Pd(dba) over 1 by 18.8 kJ·mol–1 to 59 kJ·mol–1. An analogous energetic difference was also reported
for PtBu3·Pd relative to the diphosphine
complex.20 Likewise, the formation of a
THF complex, L1·Pd·THF, is feasible. This complex
is 17 kJ·mol–1 (11 kJ·mol–1 with concentration correction, respectively) higher in energy than 1 so that this complex is probably formed at the end of catalysis
when the substrate concentration is decreasing.

The calculated
energies nicely reflect the stability of the dba
complex L1·Pd(dba) and L12·Pd. However, the high energetic
preferences of these species particularly in comparison with the prereactive
arene complex 1, which needs to be formed to enter the
catalytic cycle, are somewhat in contradiction to the fast catalysis
at room temperature. We believe that this discrepancy is to some extent
due to an overestimation of dispersion effects.21 The inclusion of dispersion effects is crucial for the
correct description of large molecular structures like the complexes
based on 1, where, owing to the many cyclohexyl moieties,
multiple attractive interactions are present within the molecule.
This has often been demonstrated in the literature also for organometallic
complexes.22 However, also, an overestimation
of the dispersion interactions has repeatedly been discussed for very
large systems.23 This might also be the
case in our complexes, which show considerably high differences between
the dispersion-corrected and noncorrected energies (Scheme 1). For example, arene complex 1 is calculated to be 115 kJ·mol–1 higher
in energy than the diphosphine complex L12·Pd, while it is disfavored by only 41 kJ·mol–1 without the inclusion of dispersion effects. The
difference for L1·Pd is even larger (165 vs 55 kJ·mol–1). Thus, dispersion effects might result in a somewhat
overestimated preference of L12·Pd in comparison to all other structures. This
is also indicated by the fact that experimentally, L12·Pd is only observed in
the presence of more than 1 equiv of phosphine, while otherwise, only L1·Pd(dba) is formed. Consistently, the energy differences
between L12·Pd and 1 as well as L12·Pd and L1·Pd calculated
with the M06 functional, which only considers short- and medium-range
dispersion effects,24 are between the dispersion-corrected
and noncorrected PBE0 energies (82 and 115 kJ·mol–1, respectively). Nonetheless, dispersion correction is necessary
to better describe the structures of our compounds and thus only these
energies are discussed from now onwards. Since all structures shown
below are less crowded than L12·Pd, the overestimation should be minimal for these
compounds.

Oxidative Addition and Amine Coordination
The prereactive
arene complex 1 readily undergoes oxidative addition
to form palladium(II) complex cis-2 (Scheme 2). The calculations
reveal a low barrier of only 49 kJ·mol–1 for
the addition of chlorobenzene, which is easily accessible at room
temperature and in the range of activation barriers found for aryl
chlorides with biaryl phosphines16 or P(tBu)3.19b Also, oxidative
addition of aryl chlorides with electron-donating (e.g., −Me
or −OMe) and electron-withdrawing substituents (−CN)
showed similarly low activation barriers ranging between 47 and 54
kJ·mol–1 with L1 (see Table S18, SI). The structures of the transition
state TS1 and complex cis-2 still feature an agostic interaction with the PCy3 moiety,
with Pd–H distances of 2.221 and 2.049 Å. An oxidative
addition complex containing two YPhos ligands is not accessible due
to steric hindrance.

level of theory (in kJ·mol–1) are given relative

The oxidative addition
product cis-2 is favored over arene
complex 1 by 79 kJ·mol–1. Consistently,
isolation of the addition product
was revealed to be facile also in the experiment. The reaction of
a solution of L1 with Pd2dba3 and
an excess of p-chlorotoluene in THF at room temperature
resulted in the precipitation of 2Tol (2Tol= 2 with p-tolyl instead of phenyl) as a yellow solid,
which was isolated in a 70% yield and fully characterized. The complex
is only poorly soluble in toluene, THF, and other common solvents
and decomposes in dichloromethane (DCM) within less than 1 h. In dichloromethane, 2Tol exhibits two doublets in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum at 32.5 and 35.1 ppm with a
coupling constant of 49.6 Hz. Suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis were directly obtained from the reaction mixture. 2Tol crystallizes as a chloro-bridged
dimer with a planar (Cl–Pd)2 core (Figure 3). The asymmetric unit contains
only half a molecule that is assembled through inversion symmetry.
Due to the dimeric nature, no C–H···Pd interaction
is found. The shortest Pd–H distance in the complex amounts
to 2.749(6) Å, which is considerably longer than that in L1·Pd(dba). In accordance with the breaking of the Pd–H
interaction, the P1–C1–P2 angle in the oxidative addition
product is even larger [131.7(1)°] than that in the bisphosphine
complex L12·Pd, which further confirms the flexibility of the ylide backbone. This
widening is necessary to allow for the dimerization. The Pd–P
distance is also longer [2.2891(4) Å] compared to other chloro-bridged
Pd(II) phosphine complexes.15,25

The dimer 22 is favored by
34 kJ·mol–1 over the monomer cis-2. Although 2 forms a dimer in the solid
state, we believe that under the highly diluted catalysis conditions,
no dimerization takes place. This has also been reported for other
bulky phosphines, which form dimeric oxidative addition products in
the solid state and monomers in solution.15 Unfortunately, attempts to determine the aggregation state in solution
by diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR experiments failed due
to the low solubility of the complex in most solvents or its decomposition
such as in DCM. However, further reactivity studies (see below) proved
its facile reaction with amines and its catalytic activity, so that
independent of its nature in solution, 22 easily forms the monomeric amine adduct and thus re-enters
the catalytic cycle.

The following coordination of the amine
(here dimethylamine) to
the OA product is diffusion controlled and proceeds smoothly at the
trans-isomer of 2.26 This
trans-isomer is easily accessible by dissociation of the dimer or
cis–trans isomerization. The cis and trans forms of T-shaped
palladium complexes rapidly equilibrate via a Y-shaped transition
state. In the case of 2, a barrier of 21 kJ·mol–1 relative to cis-2 is
calculated, so that both forms can readily undergo the next reaction
step.27 The coordination of the amine (Me2NH) to trans-2 is preferred
by 111 kJ·mol–1 over 1 and by
30 kJ·mol–1 over a possible coordination of
the amine to cis-2. This is due to steric
reasons and the trans effect.

Attempts to experimentally obtain
structural information about
the amine complex were found to be difficult, since in NMR experiments,
always mixtures of 2Tol and 3Tol were observed, suggesting that
both are in equilibrium. Nonetheless, isolation of an amine complex
was accomplished with an excess of diethylamine. Treatment of the
isolated dimeric oxidative addition complex 22Tol with a large excess of
Et2NH resulted in the formation of complex 3Tol, which could be crystallized by overlayering
a THF solution with pentane. 3Tol is a rare example of an isolated and structurally characterized
free amine bound to an oxidative addition complex {LPd(Ar)X} (L =
phosphine).28 The fact that the dimer 22Tol readily
forms the amine complex proves its retained catalytic activity and
that it is readily cleaved in solution to form a monomeric species.
The amine adduct 3Tol forms a
monomeric complex in the solid state (Figure 4) and exhibits agreement with the calculations
of the trans-arrangement of the phosphine and the amine. Most interestingly,
the PCy3 moiety of the ligand is still oriented on the
same side as the Pd fragment, thus showing that no rotation about
the P–C bond is necessary for amine binding. Instead, the P1–C1–P2
angle again widens [130.2(1)°] compared to the less crowded L1·Pd(dba) and thus easily allows for the coordination
of the amine. The Pd–P distance is again long [2.3368(5) Å].
The chloro and aryl substituent slightly bent away from the YPhos
ligand [Cl–Pd–C angle: 168.78(6)°] to avoid steric
repulsion.

Reductive Elimination (RE)
In the catalytic cycle,
the amine complex is next dehydrohalogenated to amido complex 4, which is the starting point for the following reductive
elimination step. The dehydrohalogenation can proceed via different
mechanisms, but is usually not considered to be rate determining when
using strong metal bases such as metal alkoxides as was used in the
case of the YPhos ligand.27 In the experiment,
the amine complex 3Tol immediately
forms the C–N coupling product upon addition of KOtBu as a base, thus preventing the isolation of any intermediate species
such as the corresponding amido or amine complex. Calculations confirm
the fast reaction process. Deprotonation of 3 with tert-butoxide as a base (ΔG = −30
kJ·mol–1) and reductive elimination from 4 to amine complex 5 (ΔG = −82 kJ·mol–1) are considerably exergonic.
Additionally, reductive elimination possesses only a small activation
barrier of ΔG‡ = 51 kJ·mol–1 for the formation of N,N-dimethylaniline (Scheme 3). Complex 5 next reacts with the aryl chloride
to reform the catalytically active arene complex 1 by
ligand displacement. Overall, the amido complex 4 is
the species with the highest energy in the whole catalytic cycle.
Thus, deprotonation by the metal base (e.g., KOtBu)
can be viewed as the energy-delivering step from which all further
steps are energetically downhill.

Complex 1
Energies (in kJ·mol–1) at the PBE0(THF)/def2tzvp level are given relative
to 1.

We also calculated the
energy for the reductive elimination step
for a series of other amines. In general, similar energies are observed
as for Me2NH (see Table S18,
SI). The highest barriers were found for the primary amines, tert-butylamine or 2,6-diisopropylaniline, with barriers
of 64 and 67 kJ·mol–1, respectively, which
are still sufficiently low to be overcome at room temperature.

Impact of the Ligand Architecture on the Catalyst Activity
Overall, the calculations suggest low activation barriers of approx.
50 kJ·mol–1 for the main steps within the catalytic
cycle using chlorobenzene and Me2NH as substrates. This
confirms the ease of the C–N coupling reaction with the YPhos
ligand at room temperature. Likewise, the formation of the required
monoligated palladium species to enter the catalytic cycle seems to
be readily accessible from the Pd2dba3 precursor.
The low barriers and the facile formation of monophosphine complexes
are the result of the high donor properties of L1 in
combination with its unique architecture. While agostic interactions
between palladium and the PCy3 moiety stabilize low-coordinate
species, this coordination is easily cleaved to open a free coordination
site at the metal for substrate (amine) coordination. This opening
is realized without any conformational changes within the ligand,
which might require substantial activation energy and slow down the
process at room temperature. Instead, L1 retains its
conformation in all crystal structures independent of the coordination
number and oxidation state of the metal. This is possible because
of the flexibility of the ylide backbone, particularly of the P–C–P
angle. This angle was found to vary by more than 10°, as can
nicely be seen from the superposition of the ligand structures (XRD)
in the different complexes (Figure 5). Besides steric protection, small P–C–P
angles also provide further electronic stabilization through agostic
C–H–Pd interactions by forcing the cyclohexyl groups
in proximity to the palladium center. Hence, the reason for the high
activity of the keYPhos-based catalyst is, on the one hand, the high
donor strength of the ligand and, and on the other hand, its highly
crowded but flexible structure. This concept has also been found to
be beneficial for the design of highly active NHC ligands in coupling
reactions under mild conditions and thus appears to be a general principle
to meet the different requirements in the different steps within a
catalytic cycle.29

Comparison of L1 with L2 and L3
A comparison of the energies of the important
intermediates and transition states for the BHA of phenyl chloride
with Me2NH using the three ligands L1 (keYPhos), L2 (CyJohnPhos), and L3 (PtBu3) calculated on the same level of theory
showed no distinct differences in the activation barriers (Figure 6 and Table 3). All ligands showed similarly
low barriers for the oxidative addition or reductive elimination,
suggesting that all ligands should undergo fast amination reactions.
However, in the experiment, only L1 gave high yields
at room temperature when using Pd2(dba)3·dba
and 1 equiv of ligand as a catalyst (Table 1).9 Thus, other
factors have to be decisive for the observed differences in the activities.

In case of the Buchwald ligands, the required conformational
changes
within the ligand to open free coordination sites for substrate binding
have often been discussed in the literature.16b,30 In comparison to the biaryl phosphine, the flexibility of L1 might thus be one reason for its higher activity at room
temperature. As shown above, no rotation about the P2–C1 bond
is necessary for opening or closing a coordination site at the metal
in any step of the catalytic cycle. This is in contrast to the biaryl
phosphines, where amine binding is disfavored at the most favored
oxidative addition complex (cis-2 with L2, Scheme 4). Here, rotation about the P–C bond is necessary to cleave
the Pd–arene interaction and allow for a cis–trans isomerization
and the binding of the amine trans to the phosphine ligand. This rotation
about the P–C bond in the monomeric cis-OA
complex of L2 costs approx. 55 kJ·mol–1 (Figure 6, top),
which sums up to almost 90 kJ·mol–1 when considering
that the dimeric OA complex is the most favored species prior to this
reaction step. Hence, the conformational changes required for amine
coordination might become the rate-limiting step for L2 particularly in case of bulky aryl chlorides. However, for small
substrates such as those used in the experiment (Table 1), the calculated barrier should
still be sufficiently low for catalysis at room temperature.

Energies (in kJ·mol–1) are given relative to cis-2.

Since the barriers within the catalytic
cycle seemed to be viable
for all ligands, we turned our attention toward the formation of the
catalytically active monophosphine complex. The ease of the formation
of the L·Pd species has repeatedly been demonstrated to be decisive
for the performance of a catalyst. For example, it was shown that
the use of [Pd(PtBu3)2] as
a precatalyst usually requires elevated temperatures for the amination
of aryl chlorides,31 while room-temperature
catalysis was described for some combinations with Pd(dba)2 together with 1 equiv of PtBu3.32 In contrast, the preformed palladium(I) complex
[{PdBr(PtBu3)}2], which possess
the ideal 1:1 metal ligand ratio, showed similar activities to L1 at room temperature.5,33

A comparison
of the energies of the palladium complexes with L1–L3, which are important for the formation
of the catalytically active species, is given in Table 4. For all ligands, the bisphosphine
complex L2·Pd is the energetically most favored species.
Depending on the functional and dispersion correction, this energetic
preference is substantial and implies that the prereactive arene complex
L·Pd(PhCl) is hardly formed under the reaction conditions. However,
in case of L1, and to the best of our knowledge also
for L2, complex L2·Pd is never formed
during catalysis when applying a 1:1 metal ratio (see above). This
suggests that there is an appreciable barrier for the formation of
L2·Pd for sterically bulky ligands such as L1 and L2 [%Vbur(L1) = 48.5;9 %Vbur(L2) = 46.713]. This barrier
must be at least as high as the energy of the monoligated complex
L·Pd since an associative mechanism starting from L·Pd(dba)
is not possible due to steric reasons. In contrast, PtBu3 is considerably smaller [%Vbur(L2) = 38.113] and hence
L2·Pd is easily accessible also via an associative
mechanism. Once formed, the effective activation barrier for the first
oxidative addition of PhCl is higher than 140 kJ·mol–1 (Tables 3 and 4) and thus explains the inactivity of PtBu3 at room temperature.34

Since L1 and L2 do not form
L2·Pd complexes under the reaction conditions, both
should enter
the cycle from the mixed phosphine–dba complex. Interestingly,
L·Pd(dba) is more stable, relative to the prereactive complex
L·Pd(PhCl), for L2 than for L1. This
means that the first activation energy for the oxidative addition
with L1 is lower [126 (PBE0) or 98 kJ·mol–1 (M06)] than that for L2 [139 (PBE0) or 114 kJ·mol–1 (M06)], thus implying that a considerable amount
of catalyst with L2 does not (or very slowly) enter the
catalytic cycle at room temperature, which further corroborates with
the low conversion observed for the catalysis with L2.

Overall, the high activity of keYPhos is not only due to
low activation
barriers within the cycle but also due to the ease of the formation
of the catalytically active species, which is particularly facile
for L1 in comparison to L2 and L3. To experimentally verify the computational results and
to probe that the formation of L·Pd(ArCl) is also decisive for L1, we turned our attention toward kinetic studies. Reaction
monitoring of the amination of 4-chlorotoluene with piperidine using
the YPhos ligand showed the presence of a short induction period of
approx. 5 min (Figure 7A). We interpret this induction period as the time required for the
formation of the active arene complex L1·Pd(ArCl)
from L1·Pd(dba). Once formed, catalysis
is fast and gives full conversion in less than 20 min with 0.5 mol
% catalyst loading. The initial reaction rate after the induction
period is high and corresponds to a turnover frequency of 1720 h–1, which is a remarkable value for room-temperature
BHA of an aryl chloride.

Figure 7 Conversion–time plots for the amination
of p-chlorotoluene with piperidine with (A) L1, (B) with L2 and L3, and (C)
plot of the reaction rate
under different reaction conditions with L1.

The behavior of L1 is in stark contrast
to the observations
made for L2 and L3. As already indicated
from the results in Table 1, only little conversion is observed with both ligands after
a 6 h reaction time. While this is also true for PtBu3 for a more prolonged reaction time, the reaction with CyJohnPhos speeds up after 6 h (Figure 7B) but slows down again after approx. 50
h to finally reach 55% conversion after more than 3 days. The observation
for PtBu3 is in line with the hampered
formation of the active species and catalyst decomposition. The fact
that at least small amounts of product were formed with L1 can probably be explained by the formation of small amounts of active
L·Pd(ArCl) species due to the use of only 1 equiv of ligand.35 The data obtained for L2 indicate
very slow catalyst formation (6 h) and a rather high activation barrier
(low reaction rate) accompanied by catalyst decomposition after a
prolonged reaction time. The long induction period is in line with
the high energetic difference calculated between L·Pd(dba) and
L·Pd(ArCl) with L2.

To probe the nature of
the rate-limiting step with L1 as a ligand, we studied
the progress of the amination of 4-chlorotoluene
with piperidine under different reaction conditions. At first, we
used the reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) as described by
Blackmond to qualitatively explore the dependence of the reaction
rate on the reagent concentrations.35 To
this end, the amination was performed with different [ArCl]/[amine]
ratios (different “excess” conditions). As shown in Figure 7C, the reaction rate
is not changed by an increase in the amine concentration ([ArCl]/[amine]
= 1:2), suggesting that the reaction rate is independent of the amine.
In contrast, using 2 equiv of aryl chloride resulted in a marked acceleration
of the reaction. The higher reaction rate with higher [ArCl] indicates
a positive order in aryl halide. To further examine this dependency
in the reagents, we performed a variable time normalization analysis
(VTNA) as previously described by Burés.36 Here, the analysis of the obtained data under different
reaction conditions is performed by overlaying the different progress
concentration profiles (see SI for details).
This procedure confirmed the dependence of the reaction rate of the
concentration of the aryl chloride and delivered an order of 0.6 in
[ArCl]. This observation is well in line with the calculations and
the slow formation of LPd(ArCl) from L1·Pd(dba), which makes at least the first oxidative addition step
rate limiting. Also, in line with the calculations, the rate was found
to be independent of the amine concentration (zeroth order).

Overall, these results demonstrate that the electronic and steric
properties of the YPhos ligand both contribute significantly to its
high activity. The geometry is particularly important for the facile
generation of the active monoligated palladium species, while the
donor strength results in low activation barriers. Given the superior
performance of defined palladium complexes with phosphine or NHC ligands
in catalysis and the fact that the formation of 1 is
at least partially contributing to the rate-limiting step, a further
improvement of the catalytic ability can also be expected for L1.

Conclusions
The mechanism of the palladium-catalyzed
C–N coupling reaction
with the YPhos ligand Cy3P–C(Me)PCy2 (keYPhos, L1) was studied by detailed computations and experiments and
compared to established phosphines used in this chemistry [JohnPhos
(L2) and P(tBu)3 (L3)]. L1 readily forms monoligated palladium species,
which are stabilized by agostic C–H···Pd interactions
and readily undergo oxidative addition reactions with aryl chlorides.
Despite the bulk of the ligand, formation of the diphosphine complex L12·Pd as well as
dimerization of the oxidative addition complex were found to be possible.
This can be explained by the flexibility of the ligand backbone via
opening and closing of the P–C–P angle, which allows
a certain degree of spatial adjustment depending on the coligands
at palladium. Due to this flexibility, no conformational changes are
needed along the whole catalytic cycle. This results in low activation
barriers for all important steps in the cycle and a minimum of required
isomerization processes, which is well in line with the fast catalysis
observed at room temperature. While the barriers of the important
catalytic steps with L1 are similar to those found for
the biaryl phosphine L2 and PtBu3 (L3), the most pronounced difference between
the ligands lies in the formation of the catalytically active arene
complex LPd(ArCl). In the case of L3, this species is
not formed at room temperature due to the high preference of the bisphosphine
complex L32Pd. In the case of L1 and L2, the catalytic cycle is entered via the dba
complex, which, however, is more stable for L2, and thus
results in a higher barrier for the first oxidative addition step
that is hardly reached at room temperature with L2. These
computational results are also confirmed by kinetic studies, which
also show that the reaction rate for L1 depends on the
aryl chloride and not on the amine.

Overall, these studies demonstrate
that the YPhos ligand has ideal
characteristics for enabling fast C–N couplings at room temperature.
The electronic and steric profile supports low activation barriers
and fast catalyst generation. The fact that the aryl chloride is still
involved in the rate-limiting step suggests that a further improvement
of the catalytic ability also for keYPhos can be expected when using
defined precatalysts.

We would also like to
point out that the
low-coordinate PtBu3 palladium complexes
are presumably less stable towards Pd black formation than those of L1 and L2 due to missing/weaker secondary ligand
metal interactions.
