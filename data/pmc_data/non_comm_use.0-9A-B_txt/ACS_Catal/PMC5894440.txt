In
this work, we study the synthesis of diphenyl carbonate (DPC)
from phenol and CO on gold electrodes studied by means of in situ
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results show that,
on gold electrodes, the formation of DPC is observed at potentials
as low as 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl, together with the formation of dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) from the carbonylation of methanol that was used as
a solvent. The spectroelectrochemical results also suggest that the
formation of DPC occurs via the replacement of the methoxy groups
from DMC with phenoxy groups from phenol and not directly by the carbonylation
of phenol. Although this transesterification process is known to occur
with heterogeneous catalysts, it has not been reported under electrochemical
conditions. These are interesting findings, since the direct DPC production
by carbonylation of phenol to DPC is usually performed with Pd-based
catalysts. With this reaction scheme of transesterification happening
under electrochemical conditions, other non-Pd catalysts could be
used as well for one-step DPC production from phenol and CO. These
findings give important mechanistic insights into this reaction and
open up possibilities to an alternative process for the production
of DPC.

==== Body
The use of electrochemistry
in the synthesis of organic molecules is a very promising methodology
for future industrial applications. With the help of electrochemistry,
it is possible to fulfill several requirements for the development
of environmentally friendly industrial processes. One of the main
contemporary advantages of electrochemistry is the use of sustainable
energy utilizing electricity produced by renewable sources such as
wind or solar.1

Electrochemical reactions
typically occur at room temperature and
the combination of low temperature and accurate control of the potential
should, in principle, allow the selectivity of the process to be driven
toward a specific desirable product. Moreover, electrocatalysts are
generally “heterogeneous” electrode materials that will
facilitate the separation and reuse of the catalyst. Successful examples
of electrochemical processes in industry can be found in the Chlor-Alkali
industry, and in aluminum or adiponitrile production.2 These established electrochemical processes are undergoing
constant improvement. A prominent example in chlorine electrolysis
is the implementation of gas diffusion electrodes into aqueous electrolysis
in 2003, enabling the use of gaseous reactant oxygen under high current
density with electricity savings up to 30%.3 There is great potential for electrochemical methods to help in
the development of other green alternatives for the chemical industry,
especially being that, with gas diffusion electrodes, the choice of
reactants is now extended to gaseous reactants.

Diphenyl carbonate
(DPC) is a key material in the solvent-free
production of polycarbonates4 through the
transesterification of DPC with bisphenol A (BPA). However, the synthesis
procedure occurs in several steps involving a high number of reactants
and very particular conditions. First, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is
prepared via oxidative carbonylation of methanol, and then diphenyl
carbonate (DPC) is synthesized from a two-step reaction consisting
of transesterification of DMC with phenol into methyl phenyl carbonate
(MPC), followed by disproportionation of MPC into DMC and DPC. Finally,
DPC is reacted by transesterification with BPA in the melt phase,
resulting in the formation of polycarbonate precursors.4,5

The world demand of polycarbonate increased up to 5 million
tons
in 2015,6 making DPC a high-value building
block to the chemical industry. The direct synthesis of DPC will bring
several advantages such as reduced energy consumption and environmental
benefits and sustainability.5 The oxidative
carbonylation of phenol has been the focus of intensive research in
the past by the main polycarbonate producing companies, because the
reaction pathway is very simple and uses commonly available chemicals.
However, the expensive catalyst system with homogeneous Pd and a series
of highly corrosive co-catalysts prevented industrial implementation
of the technology.7,8 The focus of the industrial research
into DPC synthesis moved on to reaction pathways using detours and
more exotic raw materials,9 but electrochemistry
can present several advantages, when compared with chemical oxidative
carbonylation. First, the reaction temperature (that is between 100
°C and 200 °C for oxidative carbonylation6) can be decreased to room temperature without loss in efficiency
or selectivity, which will represent significant savings, in terms
of energy losses and higher energy efficiencies at the industrial
level. Second, the oxidation reaction occurs at the electrode and
there is no need for an oxidative gas, avoiding the use of explosive
mixtures such as O2 and CO. Moreover, with the appropriate
catalyst, the usage of an inorganic co-catalyst (used in oxidative
carbonylation to increase the reaction yield) can be avoided, reducing
the number of chemical components in the process. Therefore, the electrochemical
carbonylation of phenol (PhOH) with CO is one of the appealing alternative
routes toward this goal. With gas diffusion electrodes for inclusion
of CO as gaseous reactant, the hurdles for technical implementation
nowadays are lower than in the past.

Similar to catalytic processes,
the electrocarbonylation of phenol
with CO has only been described in the literature for Pd-based catalysts,
both metallic10−12 and homogeneous.13 For
the heterogeneous catalysts, PdCl2 (Pd2+) supported
on activated carbon10 and Pd0/Ketjenblack11 were studied. In both systems,
the yields for DPC were very dependent on the dryness of the solvents,
and both sodium phenoxide (PhONa) and trimethylamine (Et3N) additives have shown to be necessary for the reaction to proceed.
The role of these additives was described as being H+ acceptors
from PhOH.

In this work, we use spectro-electrochemical techniques
to access
mechanistic information about the reaction pathways toward DPC starting
from PhOH and CO at Au electrodes in methanol (MeOH) electrolytes.

Recently, our group reported spectro-electrochemical evidence for
the synthesis of DMC at Au electrodes at low overpotentials (∼0.4
V vs Ag/AgCl), revealing that there is no need for an oxidized surface
in order to achieve this product from methanol carbonylation with
CO.14 Based on those findings, the electrosynthesis
of DPC was also investigated on Au electrodes, using similar conditions.
The experiments were performed with solutions of 0.1 M PhOH in MeOH
with 0.1 M LiClO4 as the supporting electrolyte in Ar and
CO atmospheres under oxidative conditions using Au electrodes. The
obtained cyclic voltammograms are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms obtained at Au electrodes
in 0.1 M LiClO4 in MeOH with in Ar atmosphere (black line)
and with 0.1 M
PhOH with Ar (blue line) and CO atmosphere (red line).

The cyclic voltammograms show that, in the absence
of phenol, Au
oxidation (and, consequently, its reduction) is not observed at this
potential range in MeOH. The black line in Figure 1 presents a small oxidation peak at potentials
of ∼0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl), most likely due to MeOH oxidation on
the Au electrode, as revealed by FTIR results previously reported.14 When PhOH is added to the solution, this peak
(as well as other oxidation currents at higher potentials) seems to
be inhibited, most likely due to phenol adsorption on the electrode
surface, as observed in aqueous solutions.15,16 However, at ∼0.2 V, a small oxidation peak, which is absent
in pure MeOH can be observed. This peak can be related with the formation
of PhO radicals, which are the first step for PhOH oxidation. Contrary
to what is observed for aqueous solutions, further oxidation currents
for PhOH are not observed, most likely because they are catalyzed
by the presence of AuO,15 which is absent
in MeOH at the range of potentials used in this study. The cyclic
voltammograms, where CO and PhOH are both present, show an increase
in oxidation current with onset potential at 0.5 V, which are related
(as explained further in combination with the in situ FTIR results)
to the formation of both DMC and DPC (although CO oxidation cannot
be excluded).

The spectra presented in Figure 2A (Ar atmosphere) show bands at 2341, 2047,
1737, and
1706 cm–1. These bands correspond to CO2 formation (2341 cm–1), MeOH (2047 cm–1), methyl formate (MF) formation (1737 cm–1) and
lithium methoxide consumption (1706 cm–1), which
are due to methanol decomposition/oxidation, as described in our recent
publication (which also contains further reference spectra).14 The addition of PhOH does not appear to change
the reaction pathway for MeOH oxidation. Moreover, the spectra do
not show any evidence of PhOH decomposition or oxidation to products
other than CO2. However, even its decomposition to CO2 is not clear, because this product is also observed for MeOH
oxidation and a clear distinction from its origin cannot be made.
Nevertheless, the intensity of the band for MF, which is the major
MeOH oxidation product on Au,14 are less
intense than previously reported. Consistent with the observations
on the CVs, we can attribute this decrease in intensity to some blocking
of the Au electrode by adsorbed PhOH or its radical.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra obtained
for Au electrode in 0.1 M LiClO4 in MeOH with 0.1 M PhOH
saturated with (A) Ar and (B) CO. Background
was obtained at 0 V.

After the solution was saturated with CO (Figure 2B), two new bands for product
formation (positive
bands) are observed in the spectra at potentials of >0.4 V (vs
Ag/AgCl).
A band at 1757 cm–1 arises with increasing potential;
this band has been previously attributed to the formation of dimethyl
carbonate (DMC).14 At the same time, a
second band appears in the spectra at 1780 cm–1 that
can be due to the formation of other carbonate, DPC or methyl phenyl
carbonate (MPC).

To shed light onto the nature of the compound
giving rise to the
band observed at 1780 cm–1 formed from the reaction
of PhOH with CO in MeOH, transmission spectra for solutions of different
carbonates and their mixtures in MeOH solution containing the supporting
electrolyte were obtained and are plotted in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Transmission spectra for 0.1 M DPC, DMC, MPC
and correspondent
mixtures in 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. Background obtained
with 0.1 M LiClO4 in MeOH.

The results show that DPC presents vibration features at
1780 and
1758 cm–1, while DMC shows only one band at 1758
cm–1. The mixture of the two compounds presents
bands at the same wavenumbers but with different relative intensities
(red line in Figure 2). For the case of the MPC solution, it also presents two vibrational
bands but at slightly shifted wavenumbers (1768 and 1749 cm–1), when compared with DPC and DMC. However, for the mixture of DPC
and MPC, the bands overlap and appear at very similar wavenumbers,
compared to the individual compounds (1780, 1768, and 1758 cm–1).

We have recently described the reaction scheme
for the formation
of DMC from MeOH carbonylation with CO at Au electrodes.14 The formation of methoxy intermediates, which
are necessary for the carbonylation, was shown to be closely related
with the electrode ability to oxidize MeOH to methyl formate. Moreover,
the metal needs to bind CO with an intermediate binding strength in
order to allow the reaction to proceed. The FTIR spectra presented
in Figure 2 show no
evidence for the direct formation of DPC from phenoxy carbonylation
with CO, and the formation of DMC is observed simultaneously. Moreover,
it is know that the transesterification of DMC with PhOH can occur
when proper temperature and catalysts are used.17

In order to understand the role of DMC in the formation
of DPC,
the following experiments were performed. The solvent was replaced
with acetonitrile (MeCN) to avoid the formation of any intermediate
coming from MeOH oxidation and no CO was present in solution. Only
0.1 M of DMC and 0.1 M of PhOH were added to the acetonitrile solution
containing 0.1 M of LiClO4 as a supporting electrolyte.
The spectroelectrochemical results for the Au electrode are presented
in Figure 4.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra
obtained by scanning toward positive potentials at
Au electrode in 0.1 M LiClO4 in MeCN with (A) 0.1 M DMC
and (B) 0.1 M DMC + 0.1 M PhOH. Background obtained at 0 V.

The spectra obtained when only
DMC is present in the solution (Figure 4A) shows small bands
at 1758 cm–1 due to DMC in the thin layer. In addition,
a positive band for CO (2023 cm–1)18 can be identified as a consequence of DMC oxidative decomposition.19 After the addition of PhOH (Figure 4B), some changes are observed
in the spectra. The most notable difference is visible in the 1750–1790
cm–1 region, where new bands rise at ∼0.6
V (vs Ag/AgCl). In this region, three bands are observed at 1780,
1758, 1749 cm–1. Analyzing these bands based on
the transmission spectra plotted in Figure 3, we can attribute them to DPC, DMC, and
MPC, respectively. As DMC is already in solution, we suggest that
the exchange of a methoxy group by a phenoxy group is occurring. These
results are strongly supported by the observation of MPC for which
only one of the methoxy groups has been replaced.

Based on these
findings, the following reaction pathway for the
formation of DPC from PhOH in methanol electrolyte can be suggested.
As a first step, DMC is formed from the carbonylation of the methoxy
groups from MeOH and CO. Next, the replacement of the methoxy groups
with phenoxy occurs. It must be mentioned that the reaction does not
occur if there is no applied potential, most likely because the polarization
of the CO of the DMC to more positive values is needed, so the nucleophilic
attack of PhO– can occur, and MeO– is substituted.

It is interesting that transesterification of DMC by PhOH can occur
under electrochemical conditions at Au electrodes without the need
of high temperatures and using the same catalyst as for the synthesis
of DMC. However, the exact nature of this transesterification under
electrochemical conditions currently remains unknown.

Through
this process, it is possible synthesize, in one step, DMC
and directly convert it to DPC. In situ FTIR spectroscopy is an excellent
tool for mechanistic studies and for identification of species and
intermediates involved on the electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately,
one of its major drawbacks is that the results are only qualitative
and do not allow quantification of the products. However, the findings
on this work provide deeper understanding of the reaction and a new
electrochemical path for the direct production of DPC than can be
further studied and optimized for future industrial application.

In summary, with this work, we show a direct path for the electrochemical
synthesis of DPC starting from CO, MeOH, and PhOH on Au electrodes.
By using in situ FTIR, we observed that DPC can be obtained on Au
electrodes at low overpotentials (0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) through an indirect
electrochemical path where DMC is synthesized and readily converted
to DPC in an “electro-transesterification” step, at
room temperature. For the first time, DPC is obtained electrochemically
without the presence of palladium-based catalysts. With this report,
important insights on the electrochemical synthesis of DPC are given,
especially concerning the reaction intermediates, opening new possibilities
for the design of alternative processes and routes for the electrochemical
synthesis of DPC that can become industrially competitive.
