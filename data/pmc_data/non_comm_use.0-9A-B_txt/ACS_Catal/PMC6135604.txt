The promotional effect
of H2 on the oxidation of CO
is of topical interest, and there is debate over whether this promotion
is due to either thermal or chemical effects. As yet there is no definitive
consensus in the literature. Combining spatially resolved mass spectrometry
and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we observe a specific environment
of the active catalyst during CO oxidation, having the same specific
local coordination of the Pd in both the absence and presence of H2. In combination with Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP),
performed under isothermal conditions, a mechanistic insight into
the promotional effect of H2 was found, providing clear
evidence of nonthermal effects in the hydrogen-promoted oxidation
of carbon monoxide. We have identified that H2 promotes
the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, and we propose this is
linked to the increased interaction of O with the Pd surface in the
presence of H2. This combination of spatially resolved
MS and XAS and TAP studies has provided previously unobserved insights
into the nature of this promotional effect.

Introduction
To
optimize heterogeneous catalytic performance, a full understanding
of the correlation between structure and reactivity is required. The
deficiency of such knowledge has resulted in excessive loading of
precious metals in order to guarantee the desired performance.1,2 However, this is not an economically viable methodology. Ultimately,
a better understanding of catalytic processes and indeed the correlation
of catalyst structure and activity are required. This can be achieved
via a combination of in situ catalyst characterization and kinetic
measurements.3

The promotion of CO
oxidation in the presence of hydrogen is a
reaction of interest, particularly for proton-exchange membrane fuel
cells (PEMFCs).4,5 PEMFCs have high efficiency, operate
at low temperature (80 °C), and are fueled by H2 produced
from steam reforming, partial oxidation, or autothermal reforming
of natural gas and other liquid fuels.6,7 As CO, even
in trace amounts (1 ppm), is a poison for PEMFCs at low temperature,
all CO must be removed. Large amounts of CO are initially reduced
to ∼1% by the water-gas shift reaction. To further reduce the
concentration, CO oxidation over supported noble-metal catalysts8 is a suitable method, showing high conversions
at low temperatures. The presence of a small amount of H2 in the feed shifts the light-off to a lower temperature, a phenomenon
which has been widely reported for platinum9−15 and gold,16 but there are only limited
observations in the case of palladium.17,18 However, it
is not well understood why the presence of hydrogen has a promotional
effect on CO oxidation. There are currently two theories on this promotional
effect:(i) H2 combustion produces
heat, thereby increasing the rate of reaction for CO oxidation.19

(ii) H2 promotes CO oxidation
through a physico-chemical effect.20



There is also the possibility that both
thermal and physico-chemical
effects contribute in tandem to promote CO oxidation.

While
thermal effects are always likely to contribute under operand
oconditions, in this study the contribution of any non-thermal effects
(physico-chemical) to the CO oxidation in the presence of H2 over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst is investigated.
This study employed a combination of temporal analysis of products
(TAP) measurements and a combined spatially resolved X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) and spatially resolved mass spectrometry analysis.

In order to investigate the elementary steps of the reactions,
a transient pulse response methodology was employed using a TAP reactor.21−25 This technique has been proven to provide key insights into elementary
steps of catalytic processes.26,27 However, despite the
ability to screen varying oxidation states via multi-pulse experiments,28 TAP is not typically used to determine structure–activity
correlations. TAP is, however, ideally suited to determine the role
of any nonthermal effects due to operation in the Knudsen diffusion
regime, owing to the use of small amounts of reactive gases.29 In this regime gas–gas interactions are
eliminated and experimental conditions maintained such that an isothermal
catalyst zone is created:30 i.e., no promotional
thermal effects. The well-defined transport regime of Knudsen diffusion
has allowed for the development of well-established moment based analytical
methodologies,31,32 which are utilized herein to
determine conversions and residence times of gases.

As structural
characterization is typically conducted with the
aid of spectroscopic techniques,33 there
is a growing trend in the development of operando methods.34−39 In addition, there has also been a development of spatially resolved
methodologies to monitor the evolution of reactant concentrations,40−43 as well as significant advances in the imaging of spatial heterogeneities
within catalytic reactors.33,44,45 With this in mind, the minimally invasive SPACI-FB technique8,46−48 has been coupled with X-ray absorption fine structure
(XAFS) for the first time, providing spatially resolved correlations
of gas-phase concentrations, catalyst bed temperatures, and information
on the catalyst structure (via XAFS). This combination of techniques
(to be known as SPACI-FB-XAFS) enables a profile of the gas-phase
concentrations and temperature through a fixed catalytic bed, to be
correlated to the structure of the catalyst at the same axial position
in the bed. Consequently, we are able to report on the contribution
of both chemical and structural effects in the promotion of CO oxidation
by hydrogen.

Results and Discussion
From the
combined SPACI-FB-XAFS measurements we were able to correlate
changes in the catalyst structure (from the coordination numbers determined
from the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis)
with the reaction profile along the catalyst bed (from the MS data).
These profiles are shown for CO oxidation in both the absence and
presence of H2 in Figure 1. In comparison to CO oxidation without H2 (Figure 1a), in the
presence of H2 (Figure 1b), light-off occurs much closer to the beginning of
the catalyst bed, confirming the promotional effect of H2. As can be clearly observed from Figure 1, the structural change also occurs much
earlier in the bed in the presence of H2. It should be
noted that the changes in temperature and structure (Figures 1c,d) do not follow the same
trends and, therefore, are not likely to be entirely connected, indicating
the likely presence of both thermal and nonthermal promotional effects.
However, in both the absence and the presence of H2, the
onset of CO conversion only occurs once the Pd catalyst has reached
a similar local coordination (Figure 1a,b), with coordination to O and Pd of 1.5 and 5, respectively.

Figure 1 Variation
of coordination to Pd and O and the conversion of CO,
O2, and H2 along the length of the catalyst
bed for (a) CO oxidation and (b) CO oxidation in the presence of H2. Coordination numbers are plotted with the temperature profile
for (c) CO oxidation and (d) CO oxidation in the presence of H2.

These spatially resolved measurements
were performed after heating
the catalyst to reaction temperature under reactant gases and allowing
the system to attain steady state. The EXAFS spectra collected during
both reactions can be fitted to two scattering paths, an O path at
1.97 Å and a Pd path at 2.74 Å, the Pd distance being consistent
with metallic Pd (highlighted in blue and green in Figures 2b,c). The Pd–Pd scattering
path at 3 Å, characteristic of PdO, could not be fitted to these
data, at any point along the catalyst bed; this feature is highlighted
in yellow in Figure 2a. For CO oxidation both with and without H2 the catalyst
structure is consistent with a Pd nanoparticle (NP) with coordination
to an adsorbed low-Z-number element (O, CO, or OH).
The fitting parameters and examples of the fits are shown in Tables S1–S3 and Figures S4–S6 in the Supporting Information.

the k3-weighted
non-phase-corrected Fourier transform of the EXAFS data at the front,
middle, and end of the catalyst bed of the (a) fresh catalyst, (b)
the catalyst under CO oxidation, and (c) the catalyst under CO oxidation
with H2. Features consistent with scattering from O, Pd
(of Pd0), and Pd (of PdO) are highlighted in blue, green,
and yellow boxes, respectively.

The fresh catalyst, however, is consistent with PdO, the
data fitting
well to one O and two Pd scattering paths at 2.015, 3.05, and 3.44
Å, respectively. Heating the catalyst in reaction gases resulted
in removal of O from the PdO structure, as a consequence of PdO reaction
with the reductant gases present in the feed (CO or CO and H2). However, during the ramp and attainment of steady state this O
could not be replenished from the gas phase and so the catalyst during
both reactions is a reduced Pd NP with adsorbed surface O (or other
low-Z-number element).

The relative changes
in catalyst structure during CO oxidation
with and without H2 are observed in Figure 2b,c. For CO oxidation without H2 the front and middle of the bed are dominated by Pd scattering,
whereas during CO oxidation with H2 the increase in scattering
from a low-Z-number element has already occurred
by the middle of the bed. From a linear combination fit (LCF) of the
XANES spectra we can follow the changes in the relative oxidation
state of the Pd NPs during the reaction, by fitting the data to contributions
of Pd2+ and Pd0 (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Relative contributions of a Pd metal standard
and PdO as a function
of position in the catalyst bed during (a) CO oxidation and (b) CO
oxidation with H2.

The increase in Pd2+ contribution follows the
same trend
as the change in O coordination observed from the EXAFS fitting (Figures 1a and 3a). As adsorbed CO has a neutral charge and adsorbed O a 2–
charge, we can therefore be confident that the increase in Pd2+ contribution coincides with an increase in the concentration
of adsorbed O and so the low-Z-number element observed
in the EXAFS analysis is coordination to adsorbed O. The fact that
CO conversion only reaches 50% under CO oxidation with and without
H2 after the catalyst has attained the same local coordination
(O of 1.5 and Pd of 5) would imply a certain concentration of surface
O is required for reaction to occur. The difference between the two
reactions is how this surface O concentration is obtained. Under CO
oxidation conditions it appears that a certain temperature is required
before CO oxidation occurs (see Figure 1c), starting at 165 °C (5 mm along the bed). After
this temperature is reached, CO conversion increases slowly as surface
O content increases. The maximum rate of change of structure of the
Pd nanoparticles occurs as the exotherm reaches a maximum at 195 °C.
We propose that an initial small amount of CO conversion results in
a small localized increase in temperature, thus enabling more CO to
react and desorb, leaving more sites available for O adsorption. This
results in an autocatalytic type change to the surface coverage, as
previously observed for CO oxidation using XPS.49

Under CO oxidation in the presence of H2, an initial
increase in surface O content is observed very early in the catalyst
bed, which coincides with H2 consumption. This early change
in structure is thought to occur through a promotional effect of H2 or hydroxyls on the Pd surface. It could be envisioned that
dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the Pd surface can react
with O2 to produce adsorbed hydroxyl species, with which
CO can more easily react than with oxygen. Although from this combined
SPACI-FB-XAFS study we have no direct evidence of the presence of
OH species, the promotional effect of hydroxyls has previously been
investigated using a variety of techniques such as XPS, inelastic
neutron scattering (INS), and isotopic exchange experiments.50−52 From XPS and catalytic activity studies comparing anhydrous and
hydrous PdO, only the latter was found to be active and the water
of hydration was found to be in the form of OH groups. These authors
proposed two roles for the OH species: the oxidation of CO by OH and
the formation of PdO through the formation of water from reaction
of two OH groups.50 Direct evidence for
the involvement of OH species in CO oxidation is shown in the INS
study, where a decrease in the Pd–OH hydroxyl band intensity
at 900 cm–1 was observed on reaction.51 Further evidence of the role of OH groups comes
from an isotopically labeled O2 study, used to investigate
a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst during CO and propene oxidation.52 In that work, the oxidation of CO was found
to be due to interaction with OH species and not from reaction with
O2.52 The current work would
suggest a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, where the reaction
is dependent on the coverage of surface species. CO conversion reaches
50% at ∼5 mm into the catalyst bed, at which point the structure
has reached the same coordination as observed in CO oxidation (without
H2). However, from the LCF of the XANES data (Figure 3) it is clear that
the average oxidation state at 50% CO conversion (5 mm) is different
from that observed during CO oxidation (without H2) (10
mm). The contribution of Pd2+ is less under CO oxidation
with H2 than without H2, which could be linked
to the adsorption of other types of species, potentially hydroxyls.

It should be noted that even at the end of the catalyst bed under
both sets of reaction conditions, where all the CO (and H2) has been consumed, the catalyst does not re-oxidize to form a bulk
PdO structure. The temperatures reached in the catalyst bed are not
sufficient for a complete re-oxidation of the catalyst, requiring
temperatures typically over 200 °C for bulk oxidation to start.53

TAP experiments were conducted, providing
further insight into
the CO oxidation with and without H2 from both a mechanistic
and kinetic point of view. For the latter purpose, the TAP data were
treated according to the moment based analysis and basic kinetic coefficient
methods.54 From the obtained values of
adsorption rate constant ka of CO for
the experiments without H2 (2.36 s–1)
and with H2 (1.13 s–1), it is clear that
CO adsorbs more slowly in the presence of H2, which would
indicate that there is some competition for adsorption sites between
CO and H2. When CO oxidation is performed over the pre-reduced
or pre-oxidized catalyst, a clear increase in CO conversion for the
former material is observed: i.e., 99% over the pre-reduced catalyst
in comparison to 71% conversion for the pre-oxidized catalyst (Figure 4a). This would imply
that the presence of Pd, most likely present in the prereduced catalyst,
promotes activity. This is consistent with the XAFS data, which showed
that the catalyst was already in a reduced state prior to reaction
both with and without H2. PdO appears to be less able to
convert CO to CO2, i.e. provide O, and from the XAFS results
we propose that a certain coverage of adsorbed oxygen species (in
the case of CO oxidation) is required for conversion. This indicates
the presence of a Langmuir–Hinshelwood type mechanism over
the Pd NPs which is promoted in the presence of H2.

= 1:1:2 mixture over pre-oxidized (white) and pre-reduced (red) Pd/Al2O3 at 200 °C. (b) Product distributions of
C16O2, C16O18O, and C18O2 for CO oxidation upon pulsing an 18O2:CO:Ar = 1:1:2 mixture (white) and CO oxidation upon
sequential pulsing of H2:Ne = 1:1 and 18O2:CO:Ar = 1:1:2 mixtures with a time delay of 0.1 s (red) over
the preoxidized catalyst.

In order to identify the kind of oxygen species participating
in
CO oxidation to CO2, TAP experiments were conducted in
the presence and absence of H2. The surface of the catalyst
was pretreated with 16O2 and then subjected
to sequential pulses of C16O and 18O2. 16CO2 was the main carbon dioxide isotope
upon CO oxidation in the absence of H2, thus proving that
strongly adsorbed 16O species (formed upon catalyst pre-treatment)
participated in the oxidation reaction (Figure 4b). When H2 was in the reaction
feed, a greater contribution of 18O-containing carbon dioxide
was observed. To check if H2 simply promotes an oxygen
isotopic exchange between C16O2 and 18O2, these components were pulsed together over the catalyst
at 200 °C following an 16O2 pre-treatment
at 300 °C. No 18CO2 and only small amounts
of C18O16O were detected (less than a 10% fraction
(Figure S7)) in comparison to 50% C18O16O formed upon CO oxidation (Figure 4). Therefore, isotopically
labeled carbon dioxide in the 18O2/C16O/H2 test originated through a reaction of C16O with short-lived 18O-containing species formed from 18O2. Such a species could be 18OH when
the XAFS measurements are considered, where the promotional effect
of H2 is proposed to occur through the formation of surface
OHs. An additional support for the presence of this surface species
is the experimental residence time (derived from 1st moment, M1) of H2, which was 0.39 s and indicates
a significant interaction with the catalyst. This could be due to
OH formation, considering that the theoretical Knudsen diffusional
residence time is 0.065 s (derived from the analogous argon first
moment and the known linear dependence of Knudsen diffusion on molecular
weight and temperature).55 In the absence
of H2, where there is no formation of OHs, the oxidation
of CO appears to proceed via reaction with strongly adsorbed 16O, with the majority of product being C16O2.

To summarize, the major outcomes from this reported
work are as
follows:(1) This is the first reported instance
of a simultaneous, spatially resolved gas concentration, catalyst
temperature, and XAFS study using the SPACI-FB method, to be known
as SPACI-FB-XAFS.

(2) There
are nonthermal effects occurring
in the hydrogen-promoted oxidation of carbon monoxide, as evidenced
from the structural changes from XAFS and the presence of promotional
effects under TAP conditions. It should be noted that thermal effects
may also have an influence on the observed promotion of the reaction.

(3) CO oxidation is observed
both in the presence and absence
of H2 once the same local coordination of the Pd NPs (coordination
to O and Pd of 1.5 and 5, respectively) has been reached.

(4) There is a competitive
adsorption
between hydrogen and carbon monoxide, as evidenced in TAP results
by the slowing of the rate of adsorption of carbon monoxide in the
presence of hydrogen.

(5) There is a significant interaction
of hydrogen with the catalyst surface (TAP 1st moment data).

(6) The presence of hydrogen
has in fact
promoted the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.



Conclusions
From this combination of TAP reactor studies
and spatially resolved
SPACI-FB-XAFS measurements, we conclude that the H2 promotion
on CO oxidation over Pd/Al2O3 proceeds through
a physico-chemical effect. During CO oxidation in both the absence
and presence of H2 the catalyst structure is consistent
with a Pd nanoparticle with adsorbed surface O, with a specific surface
concentration of O (or OHs) which appears to be required before light-off
is observed. In the presence of hydrogen the activation of the catalyst
occurs at a place closer to the front end of the bed, most likely
via the reaction of H2 and gas-phase O2 to form
adsorbed OHs, which from previous studies have been shown to more
readily react with CO in comparison to surface O. TAP reactor studies
confirm the presence of a nonthermal effect and, through O-isotopic
experiments, confirm the increased interaction of gas-phase O2 on CO oxidation with H2 in comparison to CO oxidation
in the absence of H2. We propose that this is due to the
formation of surface hydroxyls in the presence of H2, which
then preferentially react with CO over adsorbed O.

The ability
to show that the activation of the catalyst shifts
in the catalyst bed and to correlate with the gas-phase products and
thus catalyst conversion demonstrates the strength of this combination
of techniques. Our results show that the structure evidently changes
through the bed and, crucially, during the actual reaction. This allows
for a clearer picture of the overall catalyst performance via SPACI-FB-XAFS,
information which, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously.

Experimental
Methods
Catalyst Preparation
The 1 wt % Pd/Al2O3 catalyst used in this work was prepared by wetness impregnation
of γ-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, SA = 232 m2/g). The Al2O3 support was ground to
a particle size of <150 μm and mixed with an aqueous solution
containing Pd(NO3)2. The mixture was vigorously
stirred and heated to 60 °C for 4 h until the excess amount of
water was removed and the mixture became a slurry. The catalyst was
then dried at 110 °C overnight, after which the catalyst was
calcined at 550 °C for 4–6 h. The fresh catalyst was characterized
by powder X-ray diffraction and TEM. These results are shown in Figures S1–S3 of the Supporting Information.

SPACI-FB-XAFS Experiments
Figure 5 is a schematic of the SPACI-FB system, while Figure 6 is a photograph
of the experimental setup in place on B18 at the Diamond Light Source,
UK. Further experimental setup details of the SPACI-FB-XAFS system
are reported elsewhere.48 Critically, precise
alignment of the X-ray beam, the thermocouple, and holes in wall of
the sampling capillary is required in order to ensure that coincident
measurements are examining the same part of the catalyst bed. This
was achieved through laser alignment and micrometer precision stages.
A quartz reactor was used to hold the catalyst which the X-rays passed
through to measure the Pd K edge transmission XAFS data. A catalyst
bed length of 12 mm was utilized, and the data points (gas composition
and XAFS) were collected over 15 min every 1 mm of the reactor to
obtain sufficient signal to noise and spatial resolution. The XAFS
experimental details are provided in the Supporting Information. The SPACI-FB experimental method is similar to
the method outlined in previous publications.8 The O2:CO ratio was 3:1, 3% O2, 1% CO, 10%
Ar, with and without 0.6% H2, total flow 100 mL min–1, He as a balance gas. Steady-state conditions were
ensured by allowing the system to equilibrate for 1 h prior to any
measurements, and a comparison of measurements was made at the same
axial position at different time points. XAFS data processing was
performed using IFEFFIT with the Horae package (Athena and Artemis).56,57 The fitting parameters are shown in Tables S1–S3 in the Supporting Information.

TAP Experiments
An ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) TAP-2 system
was utilized for this study.21−25,58 In this setup, pulse valves are
at atmospheric pressure with the outlet of the quartz microreactor
(i.d. 6 mm, length 40 mm) in direct contact with the UHV analysis
chamber, where the exit flow is analyzed by a quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Hiden HAL RC 301). The Pd/Al2O3 catalyst (20
mg) was packed between two layers of quartz (sieve fraction of 250–355
μm) within the isothermal zone of a quartz tube microreactor.
Before transient experiments the catalyst was pretreated at 300 °C
in a flow of 16 mL min–1 N2 with 4 mL
min–1 O2 (oxidized) or H2 (reduced)
for 0.5 h. Hereafter, the reactor was exposed to vacuum (10–5 Pa) with a simultaneous decrease of temperature to 200 °C unless
otherwise stated. CO:Ar = 1:1, 18O2:CO:Ar =
1:1:2, H2:Ne = 1:1, CO2:Ar = 1:1, and 18O2:Ne = 1:1 mixtures were used in these experiments. The
reaction mixtures were prepared using O2 (Air Liquide 5.5), 18O2 (CAMPRO scientific, 97% 18O), CO
(Linde, 3.7), CO2 (Linde, 4.5), H2 (Air Liquide,
5.0), Ar (5.0), and Ne (Linde, 5.0) without additional purification.
The following atomic mass units were used for mass spectrometric identification
of different compounds: 48 (C18O2), 46 (C18O16O), 44 (16CO2), 36 (18O2), 34 (18O16O), 32 (16O2), 30 (C18O, C18O16O), 28 (C16O, C16O2), 18
(H2O), 2 (H2), 20 (Ne), and 40 (Ar). Operation
within the Knudsen diffusion regime (and by extension isothermal conditions),
which is essential for TAP moment based analysis,54,55 was also confirmed via comparison of inert gas (argon) experimental
pulse response with theoretical Knudsen diffusion pulse response for
argon.

The data were analyzed using the well-established moment
based approach,54 and reported results
are derived from the averages of three experimental data sets, each
one consisting of 200 pulses.
