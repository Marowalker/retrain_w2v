Methane (CH4) combustion is an increasingly important
reaction for environmental protection, for which Pd/CeO2 has emerged as the preferred catalyst. There is a lack of understanding
of the nature of the active site in these catalysts. Here, we use
density functional theory to understand the role of doping of Pd in
the ceria surface for generating sites highly active toward the C–H
bonds in CH4. Specifically, we demonstrate that two Pd2+ ions can substitute one Ce4+ ion, resulting in
a very stable structure containing a highly coordinated unsaturated
Pd cation that can strongly adsorb CH4 and dissociate the
first C–H bond with a low energy barrier. An important aspect
of the high activity of the stabilized isolated Pd cation is its ability
to form a strong σ-complex with CH4, which leads
to effective activation of CH4. We show that also other
transition metals like Pt, Rh, and Ni can give rise to similar structures
with high activity toward C–H bond dissociation. These insights
provide us with a novel structural view of solid solutions of transition
metals such as Pt, Pd, Ni, and Rh in CeO2, known to exhibit
high activity in CH4 combustion.

Introduction
Methane (CH4) is a significant
greenhouse gas with a
global warming potential ca. 20 times higher than that of CO2.1 Accordingly, it is desirable to develop
technologies to remove residual CH4 present from the exhaust
of increasingly popular natural gas engines.2−6 The challenge is to develop highly active catalysts
that can operate at the relatively low temperatures of the exhaust
gas. The high Pd loading in the current generation of preferred Pd/CeO2 catalysts poses a cost challenge, requiring a deeper understanding
of the nature of the active sites.1,7−9 In automotive three-way catalysis, Pd is already extensively used
to catalyze hydrocarbon oxidation.10−13 The function of CeO2 in these catalysts is mainly to store and release oxygen, while
more recently its ability to maintain a high dispersion of transition
metals has been emphasized.14−16 Although the importance of a
close interaction between Pd and CeO2 in catalytic oxidation
chemistry has been clearly demonstrated,1,3,7,17 the exact structure
of the active Pd species remains unclear. It has for instance been
shown that isolated PdOx species on the
surface of CeO2 are crucial for the low-temperature CO
oxidation performance in Pd/CeO2.18

Several studies mention the importance of bulk PdO for high
CH4 combustion activity.1,3,7,11,19 Computational studies support this by showing that the (101) surface
termination of PdO contains under-coordinated Pd atoms able to form
a strong σ-adsorption complex with CH4.11,19−22 Conventionally, CH4 dissociation on metal surfaces relies
on high CH4 translational energies to enhance the sticking
probability. In the context of low-temperature CH4 activation,
a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism for CH4 combustion
is preferred. A recent study of Weaver and co-workers also showed
that CH4 adsorbs strongly on under-coordinated Ir atoms
in the IrO2(110) surface, resulting in low-temperature
C–H bond activation.23

However,
the activity of PdO alone is not sufficient to explain
the Pd-CeO2 synergy observed for CH4 activation.
Cargnello et al. showed that PdO species at the Pd–ceria interface
account for the high CH4 combustion activity, while PdO
reduction into metallic Pd at T > 850 °C
is
causing deactivation.1 Trovarelli and co-workers
proposed that highly dispersed Pd, specifically Pd in a PdO4 square-planar coordination environment, is the most likely active
site for CH4 oxidation.3 Lu
and co-workers showed that removal of PdO nanoparticles from a PdO/Ce1–xPdxO2-σ catalyst significantly improves CH4 oxidation, emphasizing the important role of a solid solution of
Pd in CeO2.7 The relevance of
such solid solutions in ceria-based catalysis is increasingly recognized.24−27 Recent literature also suggests that solid ceria solutions of Pt,
Pd, Ni, and Rh may be crucial to explain CH4 combustion
at low temperature.7,17,28−30

Usually, doping of transition metals in ceria
is modeled by replacing
a surface cerium atom by a transition metal atom. For Pd-doped CeO2(111), we recently considered a conventional octahedral configuration
as well as a novel and more stable square-planar configuration for
CH4 oxidation.27 The predicted
CH4 dissociation rates on these models were lower than
on PdO(101) due to weak CH4 adsorption.24,27 Earlier, Janik and co-workers considered models in which more than
one Pd atom are embedded in the ceria lattice and which can lead to
facile CH4 activation in combination with PdO clusters.26,31 We emphasize that these models including the thermodynamically stable
(111)-3Pd2+ configuration also cannot explain the experimentally
observed high CH4 oxidation activity of Pd-CeO2 solid solutions. Janik and co-workers proposed that the Pd2+ ↔ Pd4+ transitions contribute to the high activity
of Pd-CeO2 solid solution.26,31 However, structures
containing Pd4+ (e.g., (111)-1Pd4+/2Pd2+) are thermodynamically unstable under reaction conditions. Thermodynamically
stable models will only contain Pd2+,27 in agreement with experimental XPS and XRD data on Pd-CeO2 solid solution.3,32−34

An important corollary of previous data for single-Pd-atom
modified
CeO2 surfaces is that CH4 bonding is extremely
weak, i.e., only physical adsorption occurs.24,27 Accordingly, adsorbed CH4 is not effectively activated
by Pd2+ in these configurations. As a result, the computed
energy barriers for CH4 dissociation are higher than 0.9
eV and the dissociative adsorption of CH4 is endothermic.27 Thus, from a computational point of view models
considered hitherto cannot explain the high catalytic activity of
transition metal doped CeO2.24−27,31,35 In the present work, we show for the first
time that one Ce ion is substituted by two Pd ions, resulting in a
very thermodynamically stable configuration which is not only sinter-stable
but also very reactive toward the C–H bonds in CH4. One of the Pd ions is 3-fold coordinated by lattice O atoms, while
the other is 4-fold coordinated by lattice O atoms. The coordinative
unsaturation of this Pd atom results in strong CH4 chemisorption
and activation. We will demonstrate the broader applicability of this
concept by computing stability and reactivity of other transition-metal-doped
CeO2 surfaces. These insights are in good agreement with
available experimental data.

Computational Details
Density Functional Theory
(DFT) Calculations
We carried
out spin-polarized calculations within the DFT framework as implemented
in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).36 The ion–electron interactions were represented by
the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method37 and the electron exchange-correlation by the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange-correlation functional.38 The Kohn–Sham valence states were expanded in a plane-wave
basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The Ce(5s,5p,6s,4f,5d),
O(2s,2p), Pd(4d5s), and C(2s,2p) electrons were treated as valence
states. We have used the DFT+U approach, in which U is a Hubbard-like term describing the on-site Coulombic
interactions.39 This approach improves
the description of localized states in ceria, where standard LDA and
GGA functionals fail. For Ce, a value of U = 4.5
eV was adopted, which was calculated self-consistently by Fabris et
al.40 using the linear response approach
of Cococcioni and de Gironcoli41 and which
is within the 3.0–6.0 eV range that provides localization of
the electrons left upon oxygen removal from ceria.42 For the calculations of TM-doped CeO2(111) (TM
= transition metal = Pd, Pt, Ni, Rh, Cu and Zn), we used a periodic
slab with a (4 × 4) supercell in which one of the surface Ce
atoms was substituted by one TM atom. The CeO2(111) slab
model is three Ce–O–Ce layers thick and the vacuum gap
was set to 15 Å. The atoms in the bottom layer were frozen to
their bulk position and only the top two Ce–O–Ce layers
were allowed to relax. The bulk lattice constant (5.49 Å) as
previously calculated using the PBE+U (U = 4.5 eV) functional was used.43 For
the Brillouin zone integration, a Monkhorst–Pack 1 × 1
× 1 mesh was used. To examine the influence of the size of the
Monkhorst–Pack grid, we computed the CH4 adsorption
energy on a Pd1/Pd-dop-II model at Monkhorst–Pack
1 × 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 × 2 meshes. Both the absolute
and CH4 adsorption energies are the same for both mesh
sizes. Accordingly, we computed all energies in the Γ-point.
The climbing image nudged-elastic band (CI-NEB) algorithm44,45 was used to identify the transition states for the CH4 activation and dissociation on selected models.

Microkinetic
Model
The dissociation of CH4 from a molecularly
adsorbed precursor state was described by the
following kinetic scheme23,46    

Here, [O] is a lattice oxygen atom
neighboring a Pd atom. To compute the reaction rate of CH4 dissociation, we follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood type kinetic
model,47 in which we assume that the C–H
bond dissociation step is slower than the adsorption/desorption steps
of CH4 (i.e., adsorption of CH4 is quasi-equilibrated).
CH4 dissociation is usually considered to be irreversible.
The equilibrium constant K for molecular CH4 adsorption is given by 1  in which kads and kdes are the adsorption
and desorption rate constants, PCH4 is the methane partial pressure
and θCH4 and θ* are the coverage with CH4 and the fraction of empty
sites, respectively. The site balance leads to the following expression
for the coverage of molecularly adsorbed CH4 2  

The equilibrium constant can be written
as 3  where ΔG(T,P), Eads, and μ(T,P) are the Gibbs free energy change due to molecular
CH4 adsorption, the DFT-computed adsorption energy of molecularly
adsorbed CH4 and the chemical potential of gaseous CH4 at the temperature T and pressure P, respectively. The chemical potential of methane was given
as below 4  where Pθ is the standard atmospheric pressure, and the enthalpy H and entropy S of methane were obtained from standard
thermodynamic tables.48

The rate
for CH4 dissociation can then be written as 5  in which
the rate constant kr is
computed from the computed activation
barrier for C–H bond dissociation in adsorbed CH4 according to 6  

Results and Discussion
Focusing
first on Pd, its substitution for Ce in the CeO2 surface
is energetically favorable and lowers the energy to remove
an oxygen surface atom, which creates an oxygen vacancy (VO).26,27 While most theoretical studies assume an
octahedral Pd coordination arising from the Pd for Ce substitution
(retaining the initial octahedral coordination of Ce4+ in
the surface), we demonstrated that a stable structure exists with
nearly the same energy in which Pd adopts a square-planar configuration.27 This structure is much more active in CO oxidation
than the octahedral structure. The conventional octahedral (Pd-dop-I)
and the alternative square-planar (Pd-dop-II) models for Pd-doped
CeO2 are shown in Figure 1a. CH4 adsorption is however weak on these
Pd-doped surfaces, resulting in a low rate of C–H bond dissociation,27 orders of magnitude lower than experimentally
observed rates.7 Given the importance of
under-coordinated surface atoms in PdO, we should also consider atomically
dispersed Pd atoms on the CeO2(111) surface (Pd1/CeO2(111) in Figure 1a) as candidate active sites. However, a previous computational
study showed that these isolated Pd atoms on CeO2(111)
will easily agglomerate into larger clusters via Ostwald ripening.49 Therefore, we explored an alternative structure
in which we added a Pd atom to the single Pd-doped CeO2.

Figure 1 (a) Optimized configurations of Pd atoms dispersed on CeO2(111). (color code: white = Ce; gray = O; red = O neighboring Pd;

CeO2(111) (dashed lines) and Pd NPs on CeO2(111)
as a function of the nanoparticle radius R (full
line). The chemical potential of bulk Pd is set to zero: μbulk = 0.

Figure 1a also shows
the surface obtained by adding a Pd atom to the Pd-dop-II surface
model (denoted as Pd1/Pd-dop-II). Adding a Pd atom is favorable
(ΔE = −1.66 eV) with respect to bulk
Pd, which indicates that the surface Pd atom is very stable in this
position. This is further confirmed by the much higher diffusion barrier
to an adjacent CeO2 surface site of 3.37 eV (Figure S2) in comparison to the value of 0.14
eV for Pd1/CeO2.49 When we add a Pd atom to the Pd-dop-I model, the resulting structure
spontaneously relaxed to Pd1/Pd-dop-II during geometry
optimization in Figure S3. Adding another
Pd atom to Pd1/Pd-dop-II is unfavorable (ΔE = +1.51 eV with respect to bulk Pd). Figure 1b shows the chemical potential
of the different models in comparison to the chemical potential of
supported Pd metal clusters as a function of their size.50 While Pd1/CeO2(111) and
Pd2/Pd-dop-II are less stable compared to ceria-supported
Pd clusters, Pd-dop-II and Pd1/Pd-dop-II are favored over
supported Pd clusters and bulk Pd. Pd1/Pd-dop-II is also
stable with respect to the O stoichiometry under typical reaction
conditions. The removal of surface O atoms bound to the 3-fold and
4-fold Pd atoms from this structure costs 2.48 and 2.72 eV, respectively.
Thus, the O atoms are more strongly bound to the Pd atoms than the
O atoms in the stoichiometric CeO2 surface.51 It is also important to mention that adsorption
of an O atom on the coordinatively unsaturated Pd atom of Pd1/Pd-dop-II is very weak (−0.10 eV). Taken together, these
results imply that Pd1/Pd-dop-II is the thermodynamically
expected structure under typical oxidative reaction conditions. In
essence, the structure is the result of the substitution of one Ce4+ ion by two Pd2+ ions, which is in line with the
much larger radius of Ce4+ (0.97 Å) compared to Pd2+ (0.64 Å).33,52−54 The ionic radii are shown in Table 1, while Figure 2 highlights the possibility to replace a Ce4+ ion
by two Pd2+ ions. Table 1 also shows that other transition metals can lead to
similar structure and this topic will be discussed below. For the
Pd case, one of the Pd atoms is coordinated by four lattice O atoms,
while the other one is coordinated by three O atoms. We emphasize
that this structure is very different from earlier proposed doping
models.24−27,31,35 The unusual aspect of the novel model is that, unlike earlier models,
it contains a stable three-coordinated Pd ion, which we expect to
strongly adsorb CH4. Therefore, we explored in the following
the adsorption and activation of CH4 on the Pd1/Pd-dop-II structure.

CH4 adsorption and
dissociation are the crucial steps
in the CH4 combustion process.23,55 The adsorption energy of CH4 on the Pd1/Pd-dop-II
model is −0.59 eV, which is slightly higher than the value
of −0.47 eV computed for the PdO(101) surface. CH4 adsorbs only weakly on Pd-dop-II. The adsorption energy of −0.15
eV is nearly similar to the adsorption energy on the stoichiometric
CeO2 surface.27 From this difference,
we infer that the presence of a coordinated unsaturated Pd2+ ion leads to stronger adsorption. Figure 3a shows the initial adsorption structure
of CH4 as well as the transition and final states for its
dissociation into CH3 and H, resulting in Pd-CH3 and OH fragments. The potential energy surfaces for CH4 adsorption and dissociation of CH4 on this and other
models are depicted in Figure 3b. The activation barrier for CH4 dissociation
on Pd1/Pd-dop-II is 0.60 eV. The adsorption energies of
CH4 on most other models are significantly lower than for
Pd1/Pd-dop-II with comparable or higher barriers (e.g.,
0.64 eV for PdO(101) and 0.70 eV for Pd1/CeO2(111)). The exception is Pd-dop-II, on which CH4 can be
activated with an energy barrier of only 0.27 eV. As discussed before,
the low barrier is due to the high activity of the surface O radical.27 The Pd-dop-II structure is however not stable,
and the reactive O atom is spontaneously removed to form the thermodynamically
much more stable Pd-dop–II-VO structure. The activation
energy of CH4 dissociation on this stable surface is 0.99
eV.27

CH4 adsorption and dissociation by various Pd-containing
models; (c) computed CH4 dissociation rates (T = 300–1000 K, PCH4 = 0.1 atm).

In order to compare C–H
bond dissociation for the different
surface models, we considered a Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic
scheme in which gaseous CH4 is quasi-equilibrated with
adsorbed CH4, followed by the slow C–H bond dissociation
step, resulting in Pd-CH3 (CH3*) and O–H
(H*) species.23 This kinetic model together
with the computed DFT-energetics predicts that CH4 dissociation
proceeds with the highest rate on Pd1/Pd-dop-II and then
decreases in the order Pd-dop-II > PdO(101) > Pd(211) > Pd-dop-II-VO (Figure 3c).
Although the activation barrier for the C–H bond dissociation
on Pd-dop-II is the lowest among the models investigated, the weak
adsorption of CH4 results in a very low CH4 coverage
and, henceforth, a low overall reaction rate. The thermodynamically
preferred structure Pd-dop-II-VO has the lowest overall
reaction rate.

We compare these data to the work of Janik’s
group on Pd/CeO2 for CH4 activation, who studied
doping of ceria
with multiple Pd atoms.26,31 Considering only Pd-doping
of ceria, a higher activity than PdO(101) is only predicted for their
(111)-1Pd4+/2Pd2+ structure.26 However, according to their ab initio phase diagram this
structure is not stable under relevant reaction conditions, while
the most stable (111)-3Pd2+ structure exhibits a more than
2 orders of magnitude lower activity than PdO(101). We also note that
the C–H bond distance in the transition states for CH4 dissociation presented by Janik and co-workers is longer than 2
Å. This distance is too long to represent a C–H bond as
one would expect to exist in the transition state for C–H bond
dissociation of CH4. For instance, the C–H distance
in the transition states of CH4 dissociation shown in Figure 3a is around 1.4 Å,
close to values reported in the literature.22,23,27,30 Detailed configurations
and the potential energy surface for CH4 dissociation on
Pd1/Pd-dop-II are shown in Figure S6. Janik and co-workers also investigated PdO clusters supported on
Pd-doped ceria.31 The computed reactivity
of these models for CH4 dissociation are much lower than
that of PdO(101).31 Thus, we can firmly
conclude that our proposed model composed of two Pd2+ ions
in the CeO2(111) surface as a model for a solid Pd-CeO2 solution can provide a good explanation for the experimentally
observed high CH4 dissociation activity after removal of
PdO from a catalyst containing PdO clusters on a Pd-CeO2 solid solution.7 In essence, the coordinatively
unsaturated Pd cation in Pd1/Pd-dop-II is highly reactive
toward methane’s C–H bonds due to the formation of a
strong σ-complex similar to the complex proposed for CH4 adsorption on IrO2(110).23

We compared in more detail the (electronic) structure of CH4 adsorbed on Pd1/Pd-dop-II and PdO(101). In both
surfaces, the Pd cation is 3-fold coordinated (Figure 4). Charge analysis shows that CH4 adsorption on Pd1/Pd-dop-II leads to an increase of the
Pd cation charge, while the reverse holds for the Pd cation in PdO(101)
(Table S3). The latter is in line with
an earlier computational study.11 Electron
density difference plots before and after CH4 adsorption
on the two surfaces in Figure 4 show that there is a redistribution of electron density between
CH4 and the surface. Moreover, there is clear evidence
for the formation of a σ-complex in Pd1/Pd-dop-II.
A density-of-state analysis indicates that 4d-electrons from the Pd
surface cation in Pd1/Pd-dop-II effectively overlap with
the 1t2 frontier molecular orbitals of CH4 and
henceforth strengthen the adsorption of CH4 (Figure S8). This type of interaction is absent
in the CH4 adsorption complex with PdO(101). Figure 4 also shows that the local
coordination environment around CH4 adsorbed on Pd1/Pd-dop-II is more favorable for the formation of an O–H
bond during C–H bond cleavage. Notably, the C–H bond
that will finally dissociate is elongated more in the CH4 adsorption complex with Pd1/Pd-dop-II (1.13 Å) than
in the corresponding complex with PdO(101) (1.09 Å). This result
is important as it shows that a Pd cation at the interface with Pd-doped
CeO2 can strongly adsorb and activate CH4.

We investigated the feasibility
of complete CH4 oxidation
on the Pd1/Pd-dop-II model. Figure 5 shows the potential energy diagram for the
complete catalytic cycle. After CH4 dissociation, the resulting
CH3* species can be further dehydrogenated to Pd-CH2 (CH2*) species and another O–H species
(Int2 → Int3). This process is endothermic by 0.55 eV and requires
overcoming an activation barrier of 1.05 eV. The CH2 species
on the 3-fold Pd atom will migrate to a neighboring lattice O atom
to form a CH2O species (ΔE = −1.79
eV) with a barrier of only 0.48 eV. Next, an O2 molecule
will adsorb on the 3-fold Pd atom (Int4 → Int5, Eads = −0.86 eV). The reaction then further proceeds
via a sequence of facile H-transfer steps on the surface forming OOH
species that are involved in C–H bond dissociation and H2O formation. The third C–H bond dissociation step in
CH2O is highly exothermic (ΔE =
−3.09 eV). After H2O desorption (Int7 → Int8),
rotation of OCHO occurs, enabling further O2 adsorption
(Int9 → Int10), C–H bond cleavage and formation of CO2. CO2 desorption costs 0.52 eV, leaving one oxygen
vacancy (Int11 → Int12). Dissociation of OOH heals this vacancy
(Int12 → Int13), while the other OH fragment reacts with the
remaining H atom to form another H2O molecule (Int13 →
Int14). H2O desorption (ΔE = +1.55
eV) completes the catalytic cycle.

Overall, the reaction
pathway for complete CH4 oxidation
for the novel Pd1/Pd-dop-II model appears to be feasible.
Weaver and co-workers reported that the formation of the CH2 intermediate is the most difficult step (Ea = 1.44 eV) for CH4 oxidation on PdO(101).21 The highest barrier for our model is significantly
lower (Ea = 1.05 eV). Taking into account
entropy, we computed that the rate of this C–H bond activation
step at 623 K is still 2 orders of magnitude higher than the overall
process of adsorption and dissociation of CH4. The reaction
energy diagram also emphasizes the influence of competitive adsorption
of O2 and H2O. This will shift the operating
window of this catalyst to a temperature regime where vacant Pd sites
are available. We can compare the O2 and H2O
adsorption energies of, respectively, −0.82 and −1.55
eV to those for PdO(101), i.e. −1.58 and −1.01 eV, respectively.
Thus, while O2 inhibition is alleviated in our model with
respect to PdO(101), competition with H2O is more prominent.
Based on the gas phase entropy of H2O, we can predict that
the free energy of H2O desorption is lower than the highest
barrier at around 500 K. The occurrence of these competitive effects
has been experimentally demonstrated by Weaver and co-workers in a
TPD study for PdO(101).56 The systematic
study for PdO(101) by Bossche and Gronbeck showed that CH4 oxidation is inhibited by molecular H2O adsorbed on under-coordinated
Pd sites at low temperature.19 Summarizing,
Pd1/Pd-dop-II provides a model on which CH4 can
be activated in a facile manner and a complete reaction cycle leading
to CO2 and H2O is possible.

Encouraged
by these insights, we also investigated the effect of
modification of CeO2 with Ni, Pt, Rh, Cu, and Zn, because
the former three give rise to active CH4 combustion catalysts
in solid solutions,17,29,30 while the latter two are expected to be low active catalysts. The
substitution of all of these transition metals in the CeO2(111) surface is favorable against the bulk of the corresponding
transition metal (Table 2). Except for Pt, these transition metals adopt the same square-planar
configuration as Pd (Figure S11).27 The most stable configuration for Pt is the
octahedral one, which is likely related to the larger size of Pt in
comparison with the other substituents (Table S2). Placement of another like transition metal atom on the
doped site is also exothermic, showing the generality of the stabilization
of transition metal atoms on doped CeO2. Next, we investigated
CH4 adsorption on these structures. The adsorption energy
is highest on Pt1/Pt-dop and decreases in the order Pt1/Pt-dop > Pd1/Pd-dop > Rh1/Rh-dop
>
Ni1/Ni-dop ≈ Cu1/Cu-dop > Zn1/Zn-dop. The electron density difference plots for CH4 adsorbed on Pt1/Pt-dop and Zn1/Zn-dop in Figure S13 show an effective σ-complex
formation for the Pt case similar to Pd, while it is absent for Zn.
The activation barrier for C–H bond dissociation follows roughly
the reverse trend with Zn1/Zn-dop having the highest activation
barrier and Pt1/Pt-dop the lowest.

model for CH4 adsorption and dissociation,
we found that the computed rates decreases in the order Pt1/Pt-dop ≫ Pd1/Pd-dop > Rh1/Rh-dop
>
Ni1/Ni-dop > Cu1/Cu-dop > Zn1/Zn-dop
in Figure 6a. At a
temperature of 623 K and a CH4 pressure of 0.1 atm, the
dissociation rate is higher for the Pt-doped structure than the Pd-doped
one. Figure 6b emphasizes
the strong correlation between the activation barrier and the distance
between the surface and CH4 in the adsorbed state. The
decreasing activity at high temperature is because the free energy
for desorption is higher than the activation barrier for CH4 dissociation. The free energy change for CH4 adsorption
is given by ΔEads – TΔSads, in which ΔEads and TΔSads represent the enthalpy and entropy contributions.
The activation free energy barrier is roughly equal to the activation
barrier, as the entropy change during CH4 dissociation
starting from the σ-complex is negligible in comparison with
the entropy change during adsorption or desorption. The predicted
high activity computed for Pt1/Pt-dop-II provides a good
explanation for the experimentally reported high activity of a Ce1–xPtxO2-σ solid solution.28,57 In a similar
manner, Ni- and Rh-promoted CeO2 catalysts have also been
noted for their promising activity in CH4 combustion.58−62

Figure 6 (a)
Computed CH4 dissociation rates for various TM1/TM-dop-II structures as a function of temperature with PCH4 = 0.1 atm and (b) relation between
CH4 dissociation barrier and the distance between the reactive
TM atom and the H atom of the activated C–H bond in CH4 in the adsorbed state.

Conclusions
We investigated a novel structure of a solid
solution of Pd in
CeO2 with the purpose of explaining the high activity of
Pd-CeO2 solid solutions toward CH4 activation.
We show that two Pd2+ ions can substitute one Ce4+ ion in the stable CeO2(111) surface, resulting in a structure
that is stable under oxidative conditions. CH4 will strongly
adsorb as a σ-complex on the Pd cation that is coordinatively
unsaturated. The CH4 adsorption energy is higher on this
novel structure than on PdO(101). Consequently, the activation barrier
for dissociation of the adsorbed CH4 molecule is lower
for Pd1/Pd-dop-II. Kinetic simulations show that CH4 dissociation proceeds with the highest rate on this structure.
We also show that similar structures can be obtained by doping the
CeO2(111) surface with Pt, Ni, Rh, Cu, and Zn. Specifically,
the more reactive transition metals Pt, Ni, and Rh can lead to strong
CH4 adsorption complexes, low C–H activation barriers,
and a high CH4 dissociation activity. The concept of substituting
two transition metal ions for one Ce4+ ion in ceria is
important as it results in a very stable structure containing a highly
reactive coordinatively unsaturated transition metal. We expect that
this insight opens up new possibilities to rationally design active
and stable catalysts of surface doped oxides.
