The rational control of forming and stabilizing reaction
intermediates
to guide specific reaction pathways remains to be a major challenge
in electrocatalysis. In this work, we report a surface active-site
engineering approach for modulating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using the macrocycle cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]). A pristine
gold surface functionalized with CB[6] nanocavities was studied as
a hybrid organic–inorganic model system that utilizes host–guest
chemistry to influence the heterogeneous electrocatalytic reaction.
The combination of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy
and electrocatalytic experiments in conjunction with theoretical calculations
supports capture and reduction of CO2 inside the hydrophobic
cavity of CB[6] on the gold surface in aqueous KHCO3 at
negative potentials. SEIRA spectroscopic experiments show that the
decoration of gold with the supramolecular host CB[6] leads to an
increased local CO2 concentration close to the metal interface.
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on a CB[6]-coated gold electrode
indicates differences in the specific interactions between CO2 reduction intermediates within and outside the CB[6] molecular
cavity, illustrated by a decrease in current density from CO generation,
but almost invariant H2 production compared to unfunctionalized
gold. The presented methodology and mechanistic insight can guide
future design of molecularly engineered catalytic environments through
interfacial host–guest chemistry.

Introduction
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 using renewable
energy sources offers an attractive route to produce storable carbon-neutral
fuels.1,2 For this technology to become commercially
viable, catalysts that promote the challenging multi-electron/-proton
transfer reaction with minimal energy losses and high rate and selectivity
need to be developed. Currently, CO2 reduction suffers
from significant overpotentials, sluggish kinetics, and low selectivity
control as well as the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous
electrolytes.3−5 Gold (Au) is generally considered the most active
electrocatalyst for CO generation with a catalytic onset potential
ca. 300 mV more negative than the standard potential for CO2 to CO reduction on flat electrodes.6−8 The catalytic mechanism
on Au is believed to involve a surface-bound COOH (*COOH) intermediate,
which is subsequently further reduced by 1 e–/1
H+ transfer to yield CO (*CO) that is finally liberated
from the surface. Theoretical predictions indicate that stronger binding
of the *COOH intermediate relative to *CO may be needed for enhanced
CO evolution activity.9,10 However, the binding energies
of *COOH and *CO on electrocatalysts generally correlate;11 therefore, stabilization of *COOH would simultaneously
stabilize *CO and thus disfavor its required desorption. This scaling
relationship impedes a straightforward approach to independently fine-tune
surface properties for higher activities, hampering the development
of low overpotential single-site metal catalysts.12

To this end, different approaches such as alloying,13,14 nanostructuring,15 and molecular surface
modification16−20 have recently gained attention. Nevertheless, molecular engineering
of an electrocatalytic surface site remains to be challenging. Nature,
on the other hand, has developed very effective catalytic systems
that surpass the limits of scaling relationships. Enzymes such as
carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase are able to
reversibly interconvert CO2 at the thermodynamic potential
with quantitative product selectivity at their precious-metal free
active sites.21−23 While details about their reaction mechanisms are
still under debate, a hydrophobic active site cavity and the stabilization
of intermediates by a highly specific second coordination sphere are
believed to be crucial for their high activity as well as selectivity.9,24,25

In our efforts to create
analogous synthetic reaction environments,
we envision supramolecular host–guest chemistry as a powerful
tool to modulate electrocatalytic reactions by selectively favoring
certain species due to highly specific binding affinities. Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n] where n = 5–8) are a class of promising host molecules for this purpose.
These barrel-shaped organic macrocycles are water-soluble and have
found broad applications in materials chemistry, drug delivery systems,
sensing, and catalysis (Figure 1a).26,27 CB[n]s are able
to shift the reduction potential of electrochemical processes by selectively
stabilizing certain species.28,29 For example, halfwave
potentials of ferrocene and methyl viologen can be positively shifted
upon complexation with CB[7] due to different stabilization of the
oxidized versus reduced species within the cavity.

Figure 1 (a) CB[6] structure with
monomeric building block highlighted in
blue. (b) Schematic illustration of CO2 conversion to CO
within the cavity of CB[6] adsorbed on a Au surface.

The cavities of CB[n] are highly
hydrophobic30 and bind a plethora of small
organic guests
(for n ≥ 6) as well as gas molecules (for n ≤ 6).26 In aqueous solutions,
a large number of gases (e.g., CH4, acetylene, and cyclopentane)
form inclusion complexes within CB[6].31 Their negatively polarized carbonyl-lined portals exhibit high affinity
toward metal surfaces allowing for facile supramolecular functionalization
of electrodes.32 In contrast, other hosts
such as pillararenes, cyclodextrins, and calixarenes typically rely
on additional steps for electrode immobilization, which often afford
increased distances between the host cavity and the surface.33−35 Their ability to directly affect surface-bound species is thereby
diminished.

It has been shown spectroscopically
and by gravimetric measurements
that CB[6] can be used as a highly porous solid-state adsorbent for
gaseous CO2 with high selectivity over CO, rendering this
molecule to be attractive for combining host–guest chemistry
and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction studies.36,37 To the best of our knowledge, neither has CO2 complexation
within CB[6] in solution been demonstrated nor has CB[6] been used
in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.

In this work,
we study CB[6] as a prototypical synthetic organic
cavity system for facile manipulation of the heterogeneous CO2 reduction on Au, a well-studied model electrocatalyst (Figure 1b). First, the host–guest
interaction of CO2 with CB[6] is studied in homogeneous
aqueous solution both experimentally and computationally. Subsequently,
we employ surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy
combined with electrochemistry to investigate the behavior of CO2 within CB[6] on the Au surface during electrocatalysis.

Results and Discussion
Interaction of CO2 with CB[6] in Solution
The inclusion of CO2 in CB[6] was monitored in aqueous
KHCO3 (0.1 M) using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
in transmission mode (Figure 2a). The asymmetric stretching mode of 12CO2 was found at 2343 cm–1, which is in line
with previously reported values for 12CO2 in
solution.38 In the presence of 8.44 mM
CB[6], an additional shoulder was detected at 2333 cm–1. This band was exclusively observed in a 12CO2-purged electrolyte solution (Figure S1) and therefore assigned to an interaction between CO2 and CB[6] (CB[6]·CO2). The corresponding 13CO2 asymmetric stretching vibration38 identified at 2278 cm–1 displayed an
identical shift by 10 cm–1 to 2268 cm–1, confirming this band to originate from CO2.

solution. The reference spectra for dashed spectra were the N2 purged electrolytes. Spectra of CB[6] from which the CB-free
CO2 reference spectrum was subtracted display a shoulder
at 2333 and 2268 cm–1. The addition of spermine
(strong CB[6] cavity binder) leads to disappearance of the 2333 cm–1 band. The broad negative band at ca. 2360 cm–1 results from small atmospheric CO2 variations
between measurements. (b) IR spectra of the region below 1800 cm–1 representing the vibrational modes for CB[6] in 12CO2-purged 0.1 M KH12CO3 and 13CO2-purged 0.1 M NaH13CO3, which exhibit no band shifts in comparison to the N2-purged 0.1 M KH12CO3 solution. Addition
of spermine leads to an additional band at 1727 cm–1 assigned to carbonyl functional groups of CB[6], presumably occurring
due to the interaction of the spermine nitrogen and CB[6] carbonyl
ring. The spectrum of the CB[6] 13CO2-purged
sample was multiplied by a factor of 4 for better comparison (see
experimental details in the Supporting Information).

The observed shift matches the previously reported
values for the
asymmetric stretching mode of CO2 confined in solid CB[6]
at 2336 cm–1.36,37 Addition of spermine,
a well-known CB[6] guest with a high binding affinity,26 led to disappearance of the band at 2333 cm–1, which is in line with a competitive displacement
of CO2 from the cavity. Moreover, the IR signature of the
CB[6] framework remained unchanged in the presence of N2 and 12CO2/13CO2, indicating
that the CB[6]·CO2 (binding) interaction is weak and
nondirectional (Figure 2b). In contrast, spermine addition gave rise to a strong additional
band at 1727 cm–1. This band can be rationalized
by a shift of the carbonyl stretching mode from 1743 cm–1 by 16 cm–1 as a result of electrostatic interactions
with the positively charged amine functional group of spermine.39 Analogously, the unaltered CB[6] carbonyl band
in the presence of CO2, when compared to the CB[6]·spermine host–guest
complex, suggests
that CO2 is not merely associated with the carbonyl portal
region of CB[6]. In conclusion, the IR data strongly suggests that
CO2 is bound inside the CB[6] cavity in solution with an
IR marker band located at 2333 cm–1. We note that
the binding of CO to CB[6] could not be probed due to its low solubility
in the reaction solution.

The assignment of the CO2 interaction with CB[6] is
further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations (Table S1 and Figures S2–S5). Both methods show a stronger binding of CO2 over CO in CB[6], which is in line with previously reported
DFT results.40 A free-energy profile based
on umbrella sampling of MD simulations of CO2 and CO is
shown in Figure 3a.
The results suggest that CO2 and CO need to overcome a
low energy barrier when entering the cavity and reach an energy minimum
at the cavity center. CO2 was found to bind with two possible
conformations in the pocket (second local minima found at z = ±3.1 Å). A snapshot of the final state after
22 ns of a MD simulation in KHCO3 (0.1 M) is shown in Figure 3b. The CO molecule
was initially placed in the cavity center and was found to be eventually
replaced by two CO2 molecules at the given concentration.
The free-energy profiles were used to calculate the binding constants Ka,CO2 = 105 M–1 and Ka,CO = 5 M–1 for CB[6]·CO2 and CB[6]·CO, respectively (binding free-energies of
6.4 and 4.1 kcal mol–1, respectively, see the Supporting Information for computational details).

by MD simulations. (a) Free-energy profile of CO2 and CO

(the z axis is illustrated in (b) based on umbrella
sampling of MD simulations). (b) Snapshot of MD simulation with one
“deep cavity”-bound CO2, one CO2 loosely associated with carbonyl ring, and one unbound CO.

To quantify the binding of CO2 and CB[6]
experimentally,
fluorescent dye displacement measurements were performed (Figure 4a and Figure S6). This technique utilizes the fluorescence
of the host–guest complex of CB[6] with an indicator dye, in
this case trans-4[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium
(DSMI, inset of Figure 4a). DSMI is weakly fluorescent on its own but strongly fluorescent
in the complexed state.41 The competitive
binding of CO2 and DSMI to the CB[6] cavity (Figure 4b) was used to determine a
binding constant (Ka,CO2) of 250 ±
100 M–1 in 0.1 M KHCO3 for the CB[6]·CO2 host–guest complex. The experimental finding was qualitatively
confirmed with a second indicator dye (Figure S6). This sizable affinity is in good agreement with the computational
data. Unfortunately, CO afforded only a small change in fluorescence
owing to its low solubility, which prevented an accurate quantification
of its binding constant. However, well-established trends of gas affinities
and corresponding volume/packing coefficients31 along with the performed DFT and MD calculations suggest a weaker
binding of CO than that of CO2 to CB[6]. These findings
indicate that there is no product inhibition (i.e., CO occupying the
CB[6] pocket due to a higher binding affinity than that of CO2), which is a general concern in (supramolecular) catalysis.42

of the CB[6]·DSMI complex with increasing CO2 concentration

conditions: 0.1 M KHCO3, [dye] = 1 μM, [CB[6]] =
50 μM, excitation wavelength = 283 nm, and Ka,DSMI determined as 2100 M–1 in 0.1
M KHCO3 (Figure S6).

Au Electrode Modification with CB[6]
The binding of
CB[6] to Au surfaces has previously been reported32,43 but rarely quantitatively. The effect of the solvent and the nature
and concentration of the electrolyte were suspected to have a large
effect on the surface adsorption equilibrium. Solubility of CB[6]
in water is typically very low (<100 μM),44 but it can be readily increased by more than 2 orders of
magnitude through addition of cationic species to the solution.45 Besides the increased solubility, the interaction
of cations with CB[6] influences the kinetics of host–guest
complex formation.46 As an additional complexity,
cations themselves have shown to effect CO2 reduction on
heterogeneous electrocatalysts.47−50 Considering these multiple intricate effects of cations
in the system, we employed an aqueous KHCO3 (0.1 M) electrolyte
solution, which is also commonly used in CO2 reduction
catalysis.51,52 This concentration fulfills the
necessity for supporting electrolytes during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and overcomes the limited solubility of CB[6] while
minimizing the effects of cations on the host–guest complexation
as well as on CO2 reduction to a minimum.

The adsorption
of CB[6] on Au was first quantified by quartz-crystal microbalance
(QCM) measurements at open-circuit potential in N2-purged
KHCO3 as shown in Figure 5a. The coverage was estimated using the Sauerbrey model,53 assuming a flat gold surface and a van der Waals
radius of “rigid” CB[6] of 14.4 Å.45 A theoretical monolayer coverage of ca. 80 ± 20% for
1.69 mM CB[6] was determined with a Langmuir isotherm. Considering
the highest density of hexagonally packed circles within a plane (ca.
90%), the data obtained from QCM is close to that for an optimally
covered surface.

potential. The data was modeled with the Sauerbrey equation and fitted
with a Langmuir isotherm (blue dashed line). (b) Increase in relative
intensity of the CB[6] band at 1483 cm–1 in SEIRA
measurements and an exponential fit to guide the eye (blue dashed
line).

QCM was not only applied to study surface adsorption
processes
by mass changes but also further utilized to obtain insights into
the viscoelasticity of the adsorbed layer by studying its dissipation
behavior.54 This can be particularly useful
to gather information on changes of layer packing or, importantly,
multilayer formation.55,56 Measurements indicated that,
for concentrations of >0.8 mM, the dissipation starts to increase,
suggesting the formation of multilayers of CB[6] (Figure S7). Multilayer buildup of CB[6] on surfaces has been
observed previously for CB[6] in solutions containing Na+.57 Furthermore, formation of chain-like
coordination polymers between CB[6] and K+ has been reported
in the solid state.58,59

The interaction of CB[6]
with the Au surface was further probed
by SEIRA spectroscopy, which selectively monitors the Au–electrolyte
interface (see below).60,61 The vibrational band pattern
of CB[6] revealed significantly different relative intensities between
SEIRA and transmission measurements due to surface selection rules,
indicating a preferential binding geometry of CB[6] on the surface
compared to the isotropic case in solution (Figure S8). A notable shift of the carbonyl stretching mode from 1743
cm–1 in solution to 1737 cm–1 on
the Au surface further suggests an interaction between (one of) the
carbonyl-lined portals of CB[6] with the gold surface, which is in
line with previous reports.32,43,62Figure 5b shows the
normalized intensity of the intense 1483 cm–1 marker
band of CB[6] as a function of the CB[6] concentration in solution.
No notable increase was observed for concentrations higher than ca.
1.3 mM (Figure S9), matching the concentration
at which multilayer formation was observed in QCM measurements (Figure S7). As the SEIRA intensity I decreases significantly with distance d from the
electrode surface (I ≈ d–6), potential multilayers of CB[6] cannot be monitored.63 SEIRA as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) indicated a stable surface-bound CB[6] layer after overnight
soaking in a CB[6]-free 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte
solution (Figures S10 and S11).

SEIRA Measurements of CB[6]·CO2 under Polarization
SEIRA spectroscopy has recently gained increased attention in the
field of CO2 reduction catalysis due to its high sensitivity
for surface processes.64−67 Typically, the strong IR activity of CO and HCO3–/CO32– is exploited to
track specific bands to monitor product stability and binding, the
bicarbonate/CO2 equilibrium, and the role of cations. In
this study, we specifically focus on the role of CO2 and
its fate upon inclusion into CB[6] during electrocatalytic turnover
(see Figure 6).

Figure 6 SEIRA measurements

dependent SEIRA spectra showing stepwise desorption of CB[6] from
the surface at potentials more negative than −0.7 V vs RHE.
Inset: the CB[6]·CO2 band at 2333 cm–1 decreases rapidly at CO2 reduction turnover potentials.
Reference spectra: unmodified Au in argon-purged 0.1 M KHCO3 at respective potentials. A spectral artifact (due to SiO2 from the prism) at 1239 cm–1 marked with a star
was found to have increased. (c) Normalized (between maximum and 0)
intensity decline of band at 2333 and 1483 cm–1 with
sigmoidal fits. Conditions: 1.69 mM CB[6] in 0.1 M KHCO3. All potentials were iR-corrected (see the Supporting Information for details).

Upon purging the electrolyte solution containing
1.69 mM CB[6]
with CO2, the band at 2333 cm–1 assigned
to CB[6]·CO2 appeared,
indicating that CO2 can efficiently penetrate the CB[6]
cavity when the host molecule is bound to the Au surface. Compared
to the isotropic case in the solution, the CB[6]·CO2 band showed an increased intensity in the SEIRA spectra (Figure 6a) relative to the
unaltered CO2(aq) band at 2343 cm–1,
suggesting an increase in the total CO2 concentration (i.e.,
free CO2(aq) and CB[6]·CO2) at the Au–electrolyte
interface. We speculate that the binding of CB[6] to the Au surface
together with its ability to host CO2 acts as a driving
force for CO2 accumulation at the electrode surface.

SEIRA spectroscopic experiments in a three-electrode configuration
were performed to investigate the behavior of the supramolecular complex
on the surface at reductive potentials. To the best of our knowledge,
the nature of the interaction as well as the stability of CB[6] on
Au under electrochemical polarization have not yet been assessed in
the literature. SEIRA spectra recorded at various potentials revealed
that CB[6] starts to reversibly desorb from the electrode at −0.7
V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; Figure 6). This is further confirmed
by ex situ XPS measurements (Figure S12). Note that the anchoring of the carbonyl-lined portal of CB[6]
is significantly different to chemisorption through commonly employed
thiol groups on Au that suffer from low electrochemical stability
under reductive conditions.68 Though several
groups have recently reported that multidentate thiol-anchoring provides
improved stability of cocatalysts for CO2 reduction, reductive
desorption effects were not discussed in detail.18,19

As shown in Figure 6b,c, the intensity of the CB[6]·CO2 band started
to decline at potentials below ca. −0.4 V versus RHE, matching
the catalytic onset for CO2 reduction (see below). This
observation indicates the reduction of CO2 inside the Au-immobilized
CB[6] cavity. Mere desorption of CB[6] hosting CO2 at very
reducing conditions, which would also cause a decay of the 2333 cm–1 band, can be excluded because the observed SEIRA
signals of CB[6] remain constant at potentials that already afford
a significant decrease of the CB[6]·CO2 band (Figure 6c). Therefore, the
results suggest that the effects of CB[6] host–guest chemistry
can be exploited for CO2 reduction at least at the desirable
low overpotential region between −0.4 and −0.7 V versus
RHE. Furthermore, the data imply that a part of the remaining surface-bound
CB[6] has an empty cavity at potentials more negative than −0.8
V versus RHE.

Plotting the 2343 cm–1 band
observed on unmodified
Au surfaces and in the presence of CB[6] yielded matching trends suggesting
that CO2 reduction of “free” CO2 proceeds in both cases in a similar environment (Figure S13). A potential shift of the 2333 cm–1 intensity curve by approximately 40 mV at potential values affording
turnover was noted, which may be related to an altered CO2 reduction reaction within the cavity. CB[6]-bound CO was not detected
as expected from the low binding affinity and solubility of CO. Moreover,
CB[6] marker bands in the CO2-purged electrolyte were found
to match those in Ar-purged solutions (Figure S14) also at very negative potentials. This indicates that
the structure and conformation of CB[6] is maintained throughout the
large potential window and under CO2 binding, suggesting
that there is no change in CO2 binding affinity particularly
at negative potentials.

Electrocatalysis
Stepped constant-potential electrolysis
experiments were performed to monitor the influence of CB[6] on the
activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction on Au. The cell
design with online gas sampling was based on recent reports69,70 and is described in detail in the Supporting Information (Figures S15–S17). Additional characterization
including diffusion layer thickness and electrochemical surface area
determination following a recent report for more standardized data
acquisition71 is also reported in the Supporting
Information (Figures S18–S20). The
system showed good stability for 12 h (Figure S21). Figure 7 compares partial current densities at various potentials of Au electrodes
in solutions of CB[6] of varying concentrations to cover the CB[6]
monolayer and multilayer regimes. The results of unmodified (blank)
Au agree with recently published findings.7 Self-assembly of CB[6] prior to catalysis without CB[6] in the electrolyte
solution during electrocatalysis showed marginal differences compared
to unfunctionalized Au electrodes (Figure S22), which is presumably due to a less favorable adsorption equilibrium
of CB[6] at negative applied potentials over the timespan of the electrocatalysis
experiments.

of at least three independent stepped-chronoamperometry experiments.

Ω change in uncompensated resistance. (a) Partial CO current
density (jco), (b) partial H2 current density (jH2), and (c) Faradaic
efficiency of 1.59 mM CB[6] measurements.

In contrast, the presence of CB[6] in the solution
was found to
selectively alter the CO partial current density (jco), while the hydrogen evolution current (jH2) remained almost unchanged (Figure 7). In the potential window from −0.4
to −0.8 V versus RHE, jco curves
were observed to shift to more negative potentials with increasing
CB[6] concentrations, corresponding to a suppression of jco with CB[6] in the solution (Figure 7a; further details of electrocatalysis data
in Figures S23–S27). At 0.39 mM
CB[6], an approximately 100 mV more negative potential was required
to achieve a comparable jco than in the
absence of CB[6]. No signals of CB[6] degradation were observed by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Figure S28), and 13CO2 electrocatalysis
experiments yielded exclusively 13CO (Figure S29). Upon decreasing the potential to be more negative
than −0.8 V versus RHE, a convergence of the jCO in the absence and presence of CB[6] with different
concentrations was observed (Figure 7a). This observation can be rationalized by the potential-induced
desorption of CB[6] from the surface starting to occur at potentials
more negative than −0.7 V versus RHE (Figure 6c).

Mechanistic Interpretation
The experimental data demonstrate
that the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 on Au has been
effectively altered by CB[6] encapsulation. This effect can be explained
on a molecular basis through the macrocycle’s impact particularly
on the rate-determining step (RDS) of the catalytic process. In this
respect, an initial electron transfer to CO2 to form a
Au–COO– species and a proton-coupled electron
transfer to form directly a Au–COOH species are often discussed
as possible candidates.4,64,72−74 Both cases would yield a Tafel slope of 118 mV dec–1 based on the initial electron transfer as the rate-limiting
step, which matches our Tafel slopes of approximately 120 mV dec–1 for unmodified and CB[6]-coated Au surfaces (Figure S30). Thus, the unaffected Tafel slopes
in the presence of CB[6] as well as the fact that only CO is generated
allow us to draw the conclusion that the macrocycle-mediated catalytic
CO2 reduction likely proceeds via the same elementary steps
as on bare Au. The altered catalytic performance however suggests
that the new reaction environment induced by CB[6] has significantly
altered the kinetics of relevant reaction steps. This can be rationalized
by an altered energy landscape for the reaction through specific interactions
on CO2 and *COO– within CB[6] compared
to the blank Au interface. This is provided by the following qualitative
arguments:(1) The hydrophobic nature of the cavity
lowers the availability of water molecules to stabilize surface-bound
intermediates through hydrogen bond formation. Previous molecular
dynamics simulations suggest approximately 3–4 water molecules
in the cavity of solubilized CB[6] without a guest in the aqueous
environment.75 In line with this report,
our MD simulations show that an average of less than one (0.62) water
molecule is present within the space defined by the CB[6] carbonyl
oxygen rims when CO2 or CO is adsorbed in the CB[6] cavity.

(2) Cations such as K+ have
previously been shown to have a large effect on the CO2 reduction reaction by stabilizing intermediates exhibiting a permanent
dipole moment.50 However, MD simulations
show that the inclusion of K+ into CB[6] is energetically
unfavorable (Figure S3), and DFT-optimized
structures of CB[6] with K+ on a Au surface suggest that
the distance between K+ and the encapsulated surface-bound
intermediate COOH is too large for a stabilizing interaction (Figure 8).

(3) Without further modifications, CB
is known to stabilize electron-deficient guests via hydrophobic interactions
in the cavity and electrostatic interactions at the carbonyl rim.
Hence, direct stabilization of a charged intermediate by the CB[6]
cavity is likely not being provided.26

(4) DFT and MD calculations
presented
above revealed an approximately 7 kcal mol–1 free-energy
difference of CO2 in CB[6] compared to being freely diffusing
in solution (Figure 3 and Table S1). This indicates that CO2 is stabilized within CB[6] and thus exhibits a reduced capability
for subsequent reactions without additional stabilization of the reaction
intermediate.

H (not shown for CB[6] for increased clarity), and light red: surface-bound
C.

The altered environment within CB[6] will eventually
affect the
thermodynamics and kinetics of formation of encapsulated surface-bound
species. To gauge such effects, DFT calculations were performed particularly
for the Au–COOH species formation (details in the Supporting
Information, Figures S31 and S32). Calculations
for Au–COO– were not possible due the high
level of complexity regarding the uncompensated charge. For CO2, the results show a horizontally aligned molecule in the
vicinity of the bare Au surface (Figure S32), whereas a more perpendicular orientation was found within CB[6],
suggesting that inclusion affords a different stabilization of the
substrate near the electrode surface.

Next, the reaction free-energy
difference (ΔΔRG) of the reaction
from Au–CO2 to Au–COOH within CB[6] and at
the blank Au surface was calculated.
An increase of ∼8 kcal mol–1 (0.36 eV) was
determined for the reaction proceeding in CB[6] compared to blank
Au (Table S2). Thus, the calculation provides
evidence for a notably increased energy required for the reaction
upon encapsulation, which is proposed to result from the absence of
solvent/cation-mediated stabilization of the product, that is, Au–COOH
as discussed qualitatively above as well as from additional stabilization
of the substrate CO2 within CB[6]. This effect is expected
to be even more pronounced when considering Au–COO–, which should be energetically higher due to the absent charge compensation
by the proton as well as the lack of other electrostatic interactions
in the cavity as discussed above.

As a result, a higher-energy
RDS is expected, leading to an overall
decrease in jCO (at the same applied potential)
and therefore providing a molecular basis for explaining the increased
overpotential required to reduce CO2 inside the CB[6] cavity.
In agreement, at a 0.39 mM CB[6] concentration corresponding to a
quasi-monolayer of CB[6] on Au, an indicative shift in jco of the CB[6]-modified electrode by ∼100 mV as
aforementioned was observed. In this context, increasing the CB[6]
concentration to 1.59 mM has little effect as the surface coverage
is not significantly increased as demonstrated by QCM and SEIRA measurements
(Figure 5). However,
at 6.53 mM CB[6] where multilayer formation occurs, further, stronger
suppression of the CO current density is apparent. Thus, for high
CB[6] concentrations, jCO is likely governed
by additional factors, such as a hindered CO2 uptake into
CB[6] and CO release due to the adsorbed multilayers corresponding
to an effective blocking of the electrode surface.

Host–Guest Design Criteria for Electrocatalysis
The rational manipulation of the heterogeneous interfacial catalytic
process by creating well-defined reaction environments opens up promising
avenues to selectively alter the catalytic transformation to desired
outcomes in the future. Based on our findings, we propose three design
criteria to rationally achieve an improved molecular cocatalyst system
for CO2 reduction to CO:(1) The induced reaction environment should
be modulated to selectively stabilize the surface-bound intermediate
COO–/COOH to help break scaling relationships.9 Recent publications discuss the ability of amines76 and amides18,19,77 in a ligand construct as well as imidazolium-based
ionic liquids78,79 to stabilize CO2 reduction
intermediates via hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions
on bare electrodes. In this respect, we envision that secondary guests
within the CB cavity might be used to accommodate specific functional
groups to selectively tune the active site environment. The larger
CB[8] is able to incorporate two molecules within its cavity, which
offers a large degree of tunability of the electrostatic and chemical
environment within the cavity.26

(2) The inclusion of the substrate
CO2 should facilitate consecutive reactions, for example,
by
enabling specific interactions of CO2 with the cavity analogous
to enzyme active sites. We observed a 10 cm–1 shift
toward lower wavenumbers for CO2 inside the CB[6] cavity.
This may suggest a decreased bond order of CO2. Nevertheless,
this effect might not be dominant in the presented system due to the
lack of stabilization of a key intermediate (COOH/COO–). The probing of interactions of CO2 with a secondary
guest in the CB cavity via vibrational spectroscopy might enable systematic
studies of host·substrate binding prior to catalytic turnover.

(3) The kinetics of CO2 uptake
and CO release needs to be sufficiently fast to accomplish highly
catalytic activities. A simple model calculation (see the Supporting Information) suggests that ingress
and egress kinetics of CO2 and CO, respectively, should
be higher than 20 s–1 to obtain >5 mA cm–2 for jCO. A high binding
constant for
CO2 and low binding constant for CO should be maintained.
The binding constant is defined as the ratio of ingress and egress
kinetics,46 and the egress kinetics for
CO2 and ingress kinetics for CO should therefore be slow.
While enzymes have perfected this independent tuning of complexation
kinetics and thermodynamics, it remains difficult to realize this
in synthetic systems. The use of cations as “lids” for
the CB portals has been suggested to influence host–guest complex
formation kinetics.45 This might enable
a pathway through a variation of cations in the electrolyte solution
to specifically alter the kinetics of substrate inclusion or product
release. Moreover, addition of competitively binding non-redox-active
guests could allow for further rational tuning of CO2 ingress/egress
kinetics by subtly changing the host–guest equilibria as well
as electronics and sterics.



The manifold of new pathways to pursue shows that the
CB[n]–Au hybrid system provides us with proposed
measures and a modular platform to selectively tune different reaction
steps of the heterogeneous CO2 reduction at Au surfaces
and to mechanistically explore electrocatalysis at the inorganic–organic
interfaces. This allows for detailed investigations of the reaction
mechanism by rational experimental design toward a complete understanding
of the process. Such knowledge is a major prerequisite for the development
of next generation electrocatalysts.

Conclusions
We present the concept of surface-adsorbed
supramolecular host–guest
chemistry in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. The combined spectroscopic,
analytical, and electrocatalytic results suggest that CO2 is captured within the cavity of the supramolecular host-molecule
CB[6] and electrocatalytically reduced inside the cavity when adsorbed
on the gold surface. An increased concentration of CO2 is
observed at the electrode–electrolyte interface due to the
binding of CB[6]·CO2.

The
confinement of CO2 reduction into CB[6] nanocavities
enables molecular tunablity of the local chemical environment on the
electrocatalyst surface. The presented data indicates that the CB[6]
complexation strongly and selectively affects the electrocatalytic
reduction of CO2 to CO, while the hydrogen evolution activity
remains essentially unchanged. The resultant hybrid organic–inorganic
composite can thus be regarded as a model system for synthetic cavity-based
heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Notably, a plethora of different research
fields spanning from metal–organic frameworks80,81 and covalent–organic frameworks82 to molecular catalysis83−86 and synthetic biology87 are also heavily focused on tuning the local environment and coordination
spheres around a catalytic active site. The development of such model
systems and analytical methodology as presented here may help us to
gain insight in this complex and important field of research. In the
context of CO2 reduction electrocatalysis, this may offer
new routes to overcome scaling relationships and rationally tune the
selectivity and activity of electrodes also beyond Au. Thus, this
concept bridges the gap between enzymatic, molecular, and heterogeneous
catalysis and may open up new avenues for utilizing fine-tuned supramolecular
units as synthetic catalytic pockets.
