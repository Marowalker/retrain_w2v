Efficient
and active catalysts with high selectivity for hydrocarbons
and other valuable chemicals during stable operation are crucial.
We have taken advantage of low-pressure oxygen plasmas to modify dendritic
Cu catalysts and were able to achieve enhanced selectivity toward
C2 and C3 products. Utilizing operando spectroscopic
methods such as X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS)
and quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we observed
that the initial presence of oxides in these catalysts before the
reaction plays an inferior role in determining their catalytic performance
as compared to the overall catalyst morphology. This is assigned to
the poor stability of the CuxO species
in these materials under the conditions of electrocatalytic conversion
of CO2 (CO2RR). Our findings shed light into
the strong structure/chemical state-selectivity
correlation in CO2RR and open venues for the rational design
of more effective catalysts through plasma pretreatments.

Introduction
Due
to the rapid advance in technology and simultaneous drastic
increase of the overall population, the demand for energy is a concern
of general societal interest. A promising strategy toward sustainable
energy is the use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources
to drive the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 (CO2RR) into valuable chemicals and fuels1 that can be subsequently used as feedstock for the chemical industry
or as energy storage technology.2,3

Among the various
catalysts studied so far,4−6 copper has been
shown to have the unique ability to produce hydrocarbons, especially
C2 and C3 compounds,4,7 which
is due to its moderate binding energy for CO8 and optimum H binding.9 The downside
is that, unlike other metals such as Ag10−12 and Au13,14 or Sn5,15 and Pb15 that
display high selectivity for CO or HCOO–, respectively,
in the case of copper, it is difficult to target the desired products.1,8,16,17 Various electrode parameters such as composition,18−20 surface morphology
and structure,21 chemical state,21−23 prefunctionalization21,23 or electrolyte characteristics
such as its composition21,23−28 and pH,29 as well as thermodynamic parameters
like temperature30 and pressure,30,31 were found to drastically affect the catalysts performance. Nevertheless,
a detailed picture of how the reaction takes place in a number of
active Cu-based catalysts is missing.

Nanostructured catalysts
have proven to outperform bulk materials21,32 in many aspects of CO2RR. For instance, a superior catalytic
performance with respect to ethylene production has been observed
for Cu nanocubes and attributed to the presence of subsurface oxygen/Cu+ species21,23 and Cu(100) facets.21,22,33 Additionally, kinetic transport
limitations can be overcome by using high surface area nanoporous
catalysts such as copper dendrites, which can be operated in a three-phase
(gas/solid/liquid)32,34 flow cell setup with an already
demonstrated 63% faradaic efficiency (FE) for ethylene at current
densities of up to 750 mA/cm2.35 Other materials tested in similar flow cells were also found to
provide excellent C2+ selectivity at high current densities.32,35,36

The exceptional C2H4 selectivity previously
reported for dendritic catalysts32,36 was also shared
by oxide-derived (OD) catalysts, which also displayed an increased
selectivity for multicarbon products while suppressing methane formation.23,28,37 Although a correlation between
the presence of Cu(I) species and subsurface oxygen in Cu-based catalysts
and their selectivity for C2–C3 products has been theoretically
predicted32,33 and experimentally demonstrated by several
groups,19,25,34,35 their small content and difficult stabilization makes
their detection challenging and still controversial in the literature.
It requires a synergistic combination of surface and bulk-sensitive
in situ and operando methods able to probe surface and subsurface
regions of the catalysts with high sensitivity. Furthermore, the morphology
of the catalyst,19,27,36 initial composition,19,37,38 pretreatment for the generation of the oxides,20 Cu particle support,26,39 and Cu–electrolyte
interactions33,40 are key parameters for the stabilization
of Cu(I). While Cu(I) is not very stable on smooth surfaces, it can
be stabilized at preoxidized Cu cube/Cu foil interfaces or as CuI
in iodine-pretreated surfaces, in boron-doped copper34 or in copper–nitrate-based catalysts.35

To date, no detailed in situ or operando
study is available on
dendritic catalysts to shed light into the possible transformations
in their morphology/structure and chemical state under CO2RR conditions and to distinguish the possible influence of such parameters
in the selectivity trends previously reported.

In this work,
we report that, although Cu(I) species have been
demonstrated to be advantageous for the increased yield of C2–C3
products, the stabilization of such species requires a delicate interplay
among the morphology of the Cu catalysts and its interaction with
the environment, such as the support and electrolyte. In the present
case, our quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
operando X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS) data
revealed that Cu(I) species are not stable on the large (micrometer
structures) dendritic Cu catalysts supported on Ag and Pt and that
the selectivity trends observed can be exclusively assigned to their
morphology and the contribution from exposed regions of the respective
underlying supports (Ag or Pt). In this case, and contrary to our
previous observations for smaller Cu cubes on Cu, Cu(I) species are
not stable at the CuxO/Ag or Pt interfaces,
which might be explained on the basis of the lower stability of AgOx
and PtOx species and the much lower contact area and interaction with
the support of the Cu dendrites as compared, for example, to our former
O2-plasma treated Cu cubes grown on a Cu foil.1,2

Experimental Section
Synthesis
Cu dendrites were grown
on Ag and Pt foils
(99.9999%, Advent Research Materials) via electrodeposition at a constant
potential of Uapplied = −1.25 V
vs RHE from an aqueous solution containing 0.05 M CuSO4 (99.9995%, Sigma-Aldrich) at a pH of 2–3 by the addition
of H2SO4 (adapted from ref (32)). Oxygen plasma treatments
were carried out for 1 and 5 min at a pressure of 250 mTorr with a
power of 20 W (Plasma Prep III, SPI Supplies). Prior to use, the Ag
foils were etched for 2 min in an aqueous 0.5 M HNO3 solution
while the Pt foils were etched for 2 min in 1 M H2SO4 to remove metal contaminations, which are known to poison
Cu during CO2RR.39,40

Electrochemical Characterization
The reactions were
carried out in a customized H-type glass cell using a conventional
three electrode setup. A platinum mesh and a leak-free Ag/AgCl electrode
(LF-1, Innovative Instruments, Inc.) were used as counter and reference
electrode. The electrolyte employed was 0.1 M KHCO3 (ACS
reagent 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich). To be able to compare the results with
the literature, measurements were also conducted in the absence of
the O2-plasma pretreatment. Prior to usage, the electrolyte
was treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) to remove trace
metal impurities.40,41 Before introducing the working
electrode into the cell, the electrolyte was purged with CO2 gas (99.95%, Air Liquide) for 30 min until a pH of 6.8 was reached.
The reaction was investigated at different potentials using the chronoamperometry
method. Gas products from the cell were injected online every 16 min
into a gas chromatograph (GC, Shimadzu 2014; HayeSepQ + HayeSepR column;
flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector
(TCD)) while the liquid products were detected after 1.5 h of reaction
using a liquid chromatograph (HPLC Shimadzu; NUCLEOGEL SUGAR 810 column;
refractive index detector (RID)).

Quasi in Situ X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy
Quasi
in situ XPS measurements were performed directly after electrochemistry
without exposing the sample to air by transferring it from the electrochemical
cell (EC-Cell) to the adjacent XPS chamber in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).
Before UHV transfer, the sample was rinsed within the electrochemical
cell with 10 mL of deionized water (R = 18.2 MΩ),
which was bubbled with N2 (99.999%, Air Liquide) for 45
min prior to usage. Figure S1 shows the
experimental setup. For the XPS measurements, a commercial Phoibos100
analyzer (SPECS GmbH, Epass = 15 eV) and
XR50 (SPECS GmbH) X-ray source were employed. For our study, the Al
anode (Psource = 300 W) was used to measure
all but the Cu-Auger spectra. A Mg anode (Psource = 250 W) was utilized to avoid an overlap with the Ag 3p region
in the case of the Cu samples grown on the Ag substrate. The Cu 2p3/2 peak corresponding to CuO (Ebin = 933.11 eV)42 was used to align the
spectra for the samples containing CuO, and the binding energy of
Cu/Cu2O (Ebin = 932.67 eV)42 was used for the samples not showing any CuO.
The electrochemical measurements were carried out using an Autolab
potentiostat (PGSTAT 302N).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM) measurements were performed using a Quanta 200 FEG microscope
from FEI with a field emitter as electron source (10 kV). To acquire
the images, a secondary electron detector (Everhart Thornley) was
employed. The EDX measurements were performed with a separate liquid-N2-cooled detector (10 kV).

X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure
Spectroscopy
The XAFS
measurements were performed at the undulator beamline P65 of the PETRA
III storage ring operating at 6 GeV in top-up mode. For the energy
scan, a Si(111) monochromator was used with 60% detuning to reject
higher harmonics. The experiments were performed in fluorescence mode
at the Cu–K edge (8989 eV) at an angle of 15° using a
Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) detector. For each sample,
multiple identical spectra were acquired before and under operando
conditions and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Initial
processing of the data was performed in Athena.43 The spectra have also been corrected for self-absorption
using the algorithms implemented within Athena,44 so that the edges and the edge step size of the merged
spectra and our measured reference spectra were aligned. Extended
X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) analysis was
conducted in Artemis using the FEFF6 code43 to extract the coordination numbers (CN), interatomic distances,
and disorder parameters. S0, the amplitude
reduction factor accounting for many body effects, was determined
by fitting our measured reference with a fixed coordination number
of N = 12 for the Cu–Cu coordination. Linear
combination fitting of the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy
(XANES) data was done using Athena.

In order to perform the
operando measurements, a customized three electrode electrochemical
cell including a leak-free Ag/AgCl reference and a Pt mesh counter
electrode was used. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution of 0.1
M KHCO3.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows typical
SEM images obtained on our Cu dendrite catalysts deposited on Ag and
Pt foils before and after a 5 min O2-plasma treatment and
subsequent CO2RR. It is important to note that, due to
the evolving hydrogen bubbles during the Cu dendrite electrodeposition
process, parts of the different substrates are not completely covered
with copper dendrites after electrodeposition (see Figure S2), and consequently, the substrates may serve as
active cocatalyst supports during the CO2RR.

Figure 1 SEM images
of Cu dendrites deposited on an Ag-foil (a, b, e, f)
and Pt-foil (c, d, g, h) acquired before and after CO2RR
at −1.0 V vs RHE for the untreated (a–d) and 5 min O2-plasma treated (e–h) samples. The scale bars correspond
to 2 μm.

As seen in our SEM microscopy
images, the low-pressure O2-plasma exposure changes the
morphology of the pristine silver substrate
even for exposure times as short as 1 min (see Figure S3 (a–f)), while the clean Pt substrate remains
unaffected (Figure S3 (g–i)). Nevertheless,
once the Cu dendrites were electrochemically grown on both substrates,
the dendrites themselves were found to be surprisingly resistant to
morphological changes after short plasma treatment times up to 1 min
(see Figure S4) and to CO2RR
conditions for up to 1 h at −0.9 V vs RHE. This picture changes
for longer plasma treatment times such as 5 min. Here, a decrease
in the sharpness of the dendrite tips (Figure 1 (e,g)) is observed, which results from the
formation of CuO, as confirmed by our XPS and EDX measurements (Table S1). Upon exposure to the electrochemical
conditions, visible roughening and the presence of small particles
on top of the dendrites are observed (Figure 1 (f,h)).

To estimate the change in
the roughness of the former samples,
capacitance measurements were used.20,23 The data are
shown in Figure S5 and are consistent with
our SEM analysis. Upon plasma oxidation prior to CO2RR,
the roughness of both samples increases independently of the substrate
used. Nevertheless, the increase is two times higher on the Ag substrate
as compared to the Pt substrate (see Figure S5). We assigned this difference to the larger changes experienced
by the Ag substrate upon O2-plasma exposure (Figure S3).

The combined faradaic efficiency
for the targeted C2 and C3 hydrocarbons is shown
in Figure 2 (a) together
with that of CO (Figure 2 (b)), methane (Figure 2 (c)), the parasitic hydrogen
evolution reaction (Figure 2 (d)), and the desired multicarbon products, namely, ethanol
(Figure 2 (e)) and
ethylene (Figure 2 (f))
(for 1-prop, C2H6, and HCOOH, see Figure S6). It is evident that the O2-plasma pretreatment is able to increase the yield of the desired
C2–C3 products by up to 20% at −0.9 V vs RHE, while
suppressing hydrogen and methane formation, which has not been demonstrated
for these types of samples in the absence of the plasma prefunctionalization.
Another important new feature of the present samples is that there
is an additional promoting effect on the selectivity toward C2 and C3 products depending on the substrate used.
In this case, and regardless of the plasma pretreatment, the performance
of the dendrites is increased when supported on Ag versus Pt. We attribute
this difference to the fact that Ag is able to reduce CO2 toward CO while Pt is known to be active only for the hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) and not for CO2RR due to its strong binding
to CO that leads to poisoning of the surface.4 The Ag substrate serves as a source for CO that might be more strongly
bound at the rough Cu dendrite/Ag support interface, similar to what
has been reported for other gases on these types of interfaces.34 This might facilitate further CO2 reduction to C2–C3 products.

Figure 2 (a) Combined
CO2RR faradaic efficiency for C2 + C3 products and individual faradaic efficiencies for
(b) CO, (c) CH4, (d) H2, (e) ethanol, and (f)
C2H4 from Cu dendrites grown on Ag (black and
red curves) and Pt (green and blue curves) substrates as a function
of the potential in 0.1 M KHCO3. Data from the as prepared
(untreated) and 5 min O2-plasma treated samples are shown.
Solid lines are a guide for the eye.

To gain further insight into the role of the support on CO2RR, the CO faradaic efficiency of the pristine Ag and Pt substrates
must be considered, Figures S8 and S9.
Our plasma treated Ag substrate is active for CO2 reduction
toward CO in the entire potential range investigated here for Cu dendrites/Ag,
while Pt is only shown to be active for HER but not for CO2RR. For the Cu/Ag system, 5–10% CO is detected at potentials
higher than −0.95 V vs RHE, while no CO is detected for Cu/Pt.
This indicates that the CO observed at these high potentials is being
produced on exposed Ag substrate areas.1,23 On the other
hand, exposed Pt areas in the Cu/Pt system lead to the observed increase
in the hydrogen production above −0.9 V vs RHE.

In Figure 2 (b),
it can be seen that the highest CO production at low overpotential
(−0.6 V vs RHE) is obtained for the Cu/Ag sample pretreated
by a 5 min O2-plasma. This is assigned to the role of the
Ag support, since the pristine plasma-treated Ag foil is up to 70%
more selective toward CO in comparison to the untreated one at the
same potential due to its enhanced roughness and special defects created
during the plasma pretreatment.10 Therefore,
the improved selectivity toward C2 and C3 products
observed for the Ag-supported Cu dendrites as compared to those grown
on Pt is indeed linked to the amount of CO generated by the substrate
which, in a coupled reaction mechanism, is able to become further
reduced by the dendritic copper overlayer.

Since in the case
of the Cu/Pt system the generated CO can only
originate from the copper dendrites, the decreased selectivity toward
CO upon oxygen plasma treatment suggests the preference of a different
pathway, namely, the one leading to C2–C3 products (18% increase after O2-plasma with respect to
the as prepared state for potentials as low as −0.7 V vs RHE).
In addition, our plasma treatment is able to further reduce the selectivity
toward methane for potentials higher than −0.9 V vs RHE in
favor of ethylene and ethanol on both substrates. Nevertheless, this
additional CH4 suppression is proportional to the roughness
(see Figure S5), which might result in
an increased local pH.34,36 The overall increase in the ethylene
and ethanol production can however not be explained by this fact alone,
as the increase of up to 20% is already present at potentials as low
as −0.9 V vs RHE, while the methane generation is not observed
for potentials lower than −0.9 V vs RHE for the as prepared
samples on Ag and Pt. Moreover, our plasma treated samples were found
to suppress the unwanted parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus,
we attribute the overall higher partial current density for hydrocarbons
on Ag-supported samples as compared to the Pt-supported ones to the
further reduction of the CO generated on the exposed areas of the
Ag substrate.

To further understand the role of the chemical
state of Cu and
the surface roughness on CO2RR activity and selectivity,
quasi in situ XPS and operando XAFS measurements of our catalysts
were conducted. The results are shown in Figures 3 and 4 as well as
in Figure S10 and Table S2 for the Ag substrate,
which turns out to be metallic during CO2RR. As it can
be seen from the fitting of the Cu LMM Auger lines with the corresponding
reference spectra, all samples contain CuxO species before CO2RR, and the ones O2-plasma
pretreated were found to have fully oxidized CuO surfaces.

Figure 3 Quasi in situ
Cu LMM XPS spectra acquired on Ag- and Pt-supported
Cu dendrites before (a, c) and after 1h of CO2RR at an
applied potential of −0.9V vs RHE (b, d). The spectra are fitted
with a linear combination of the corresponding Cu, Cu2O,
and CuO reference spectra.

Figure 4 XANES spectra of the as prepared and 5 min O2-plasma
treated Cu dendrite samples supported on (a) Ag and (b) and Pt. The
measurements were conducted on the differently pretreated samples
before and during CO2RR at −0.9 V vs RHE. Panels
(c) and (d) show the corresponding FT signals in r-space for Cu/Ag
and Cu/Pt. Dashed lines indicate the position of the characteristic
peaks for Cu–Cu and Cu–O coordination.

On the Cu dendrite samples, the quasi in situ XPS
data (Figure 3) revealed
that,
irrespective of the sample pretreatment, the oxides do not survive
during CO2RR at an applied potential of −0.9 V vs
RHE, which is the peak performance potential for ethylene production.
Consequently, we do not expect them to be present at even higher potentials
(such as −1.0 V or −1.1 V vs RHE), which in fact were
found to show a high faradaic efficiency for ethanol and 1-propanol.
The improved C2–C3 selectivity of these
dendritic structures is therefore not linked to the presence of residual
CuxO during the reaction, as previously
discussed in the literature based on ex situ spectroscopic data,32,45 since they promptly become reduced under reaction conditions, but
rather to their rough and defective structure. Additionally, we tested
whether CuxO species are present directly
after the in situ dendritic electrochemical growth and before CO2RR to shed light into a question raised in the literature32 on whether the improved C–C coupling
observed for these structures could be due to the fact that the dendrites
were initially containing CuxO and that
the subsequent oxide-reduction process could lead to their improved
catalytic performance. We therefore grew the dendrites on a commercially
available carbon-based gas diffusion electrode (Freudenberg C2 GDL)
within our UHV-compatible electrochemical cell and conducted quasi
in situ XPS measurements directly after deposition (following the
synthesis described in ref (32)) and before air exposure. No CuxO species were observed directly after deposition (Figure S11). These XPS data corroborate that the better efficiency
for C2 and C3 products seen for our plasma-pretreated
dendrite samples and also for the pristine dendrite samples presented
in the literature is not linked to residual Cu oxides remaining during
the reaction.

Regarding the role of the needle-like structure,
Klingan et al.36 were able to show that
indeed the local pH at
the dendrite surface increases, thus favoring the formation of ethylene
over methane. That this increase in the selectivity is indeed linked
to the needle like structure and not to an overall roughness of the
dendrite surface was demonstrated by Reller et al.32 who reported a clear drop of the selectivity toward ethylene
in correlation to a coarsening of the needle-like structures. Although
we managed to stabilize this beneficial dendritic structure even upon
plasma pretreatment, our catalysts show a worse performance for C–C
hydrocarbons as compared to previously published oxide derived catalysts,23 which is possibly due to the lack of stabilization
of Cu(I) within the copper dendrites supported on Ag and Pt as shown
by our quasi in situ XPS and operando XAFS.

Since XPS is a surface-sensitive
technique and does not provide
bulk chemical or structural information, operando XAFS measurements
were carried out to confirm the absence of the Cu oxides also under
subsurface reaction conditions, Figure 4. It was hypothesized
that such oxides could migrate toward the surface during the reaction
due to the concentration gradient across the sample and through their
progressive reduction lead to a special defective undercoordinated
structure that was stable during the reaction. Linear combination
fitting (see Table S3) of the XANES data
presented in Figure 4 (a,b) reveals that CuO is the dominant species for our plasma treated
samples on both substrates before electrochemistry, which is consistent
with our XPS analysis (Figure 3), but now, we also demonstrate that it is not only available
at the sample surface. Regarding the as prepared Cu dendrites (without
plasma exposure) before electrochemistry, a mixture of mainly Cu (53%)
and Cu2O (46%) for the case of the Pt substrate was found
while on Ag, the majority of the Cu dendrites are made of Cu2O (86%). We attribute this to the fact that the samples were exposed
to air after their synthesis before the operando CO2RR
XAFS measurements.

Once the potential of −0.9 V vs RHE
is applied during CO2RR, we see almost immediately a change
of the XANES spectrum
reflecting only the presence of metallic Cu, independently of the
initial oxidation state and the substrate used (see Figure 4), as also determined by linear
combination fitting. This change can also be clearly seen when looking
at the r-space representation of our EXAFS data (Figure 4 (c,d)), as the characteristic
peaks for Cu2O (1.45 Å) and CuO (1.55 Å) vanish
during CO2RR, giving rise to the metallic peak at 2.2 Å,
which reflects Cu–Cu coordination. In agreement, our EXAFS
fitting analysis shows a Cu–Cu coordination number of NPt = 10.8–11.3 ± 1.0 for the Pt-supported
and NAg = 11.8 ± 1.5 for the Ag-supported
Cu dendrites (see also Table S4). Taking
into account the error margins and the fact that the spectra have
been corrected for self-absorption, we conclude that our Cu dendrites
consist of bulk metallic Cu (NCu–Cu = 12), which demonstrates that not only the very surface, as probed
by XPS, but also the bulk of the sample is metallic during CO2RR. Thus, CuxO species cannot
be the active species for the conversion of CO2 toward
hydrocarbons in the dendritic Cu structures. This indicates that the
structural properties, especially in the case of the plasma-treated/preoxidized
Cu dendrites, are the most important factors determining their CO2RR performance.

Conclusions
Our in situ and operando
investigation of dendritic Cu electrocatalysts
reveals the intricate interplay between structural and chemical characteristics
of these materials and their underlying supports with respect to their
performance for CO2 electro-reduction. Here, we were able
to improve an already promising CO2RR catalyst with respect
to its selectivity toward ethylene and ethanol by combining the benefits
of a low-pressure O2-plasma treatment leading to an increase
of the catalyst surface roughness, with the selection of a suitable
support, in this case, Ag, that could serve to increase the CO concentration
in the proximity of the Cu catalyst. On such structures, a drastic
suppression of the parasitic hydrogen production could be achieved.

Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that the ∼45% faradaic
efficiency for C2–C3 products obtained
is related to structural properties on these materials and not to
the presence of residual CuxO in the vicinity
of the surface or within the bulk as was previously postulated for
related oxide-derived Cu catalysts based on ex situ spectroscopic
data.
