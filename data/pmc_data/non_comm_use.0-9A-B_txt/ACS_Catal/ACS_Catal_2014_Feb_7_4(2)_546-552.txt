The direct amination of aliphatic
C–H bonds represents a
most valuable transformation in organic chemistry. While a number
of transition-metal-based catalysts have been developed and investigated
for this purpose, the possibility to execute this transformation with
biological catalysts has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report
that cytochrome P450 enzymes can serve as efficient catalysts for
mediating intramolecular benzylic C–H amination reactions in
a variety of arylsulfonyl azide compouds. Under optimized conditions,
the P450 catalysts were found to support up to 390 total turnovers
leading to the formation of the desired sultam products with excellent
regioselectivity. In addition, the chiral environment provided by
the enzyme active site allowed for the reaction to proceed in a stereo-
and enantioselective manner. The C–H amination activity, substrate
profile, and enantio/stereoselectivity of these catalysts could be
modulated by utilizing enzyme variants with engineered active sites.

1 Introduction
Catalytic
methods for the direct amination of aliphatic (sp3) C–H
bonds are of outstanding synthetic relevance
owing to the ubiquitous occurrence of amine functionalities among
natural and synthetic molecules. In recent years, notable progress
has been made in the development of transition-metal-based catalysts
for the formation of C–N bonds, in particular through mechanisms
involving metal–nitrenoid C–H insertion reactions.1−3 For example, efficient catalytic systems have been developed for
this purpose that rely on Rh,4−7 Ir,8,9 Ru,10 Fe,11 or Ag12 complexes in combination with various nitrene sources (e.g., pre-
or in situ-formed iminoiodinanes, azides). Following the pioneering
work of Breslow and Gellman,13 other groups
have also demonstrated the reactivity of metal–porphyrin complexes
toward supporting the catalytic amination of aliphatic C–H
bonds in both intra- and intermolecular settings.14−17

While the toolbox of chemical
strategies for C–H amination
have continued to expand over the past decade, including notable enantioselective
variations thereof,7,9,10,18,19 a biocatalytic
counterpart in the natural world has thus far not been identified
(i.e., an enzyme that can catalyze the formation of C–N bonds
via the direct insertion of nitrene species into a saturated C–H
bond). Indeed, known classes of enzymes implicated in C–N bond-forming
transformations include ammonia lyases, aminomutases, and transaminases,20−23 all of which operate at carbon atom centers at higher oxidation
states. Clearly, the development of enzymatic platforms for supporting
C–H amination transformations would be very attractive, particularly
toward the design and implementation of sustainable and environmentally
friendly procedures for chemical synthesis.24

Of particular relevance to the present work is an early report
from Dawson and Breslow,25 which described
the formation of a C–H amination product upon incubation of
iminoiodane substrates with microsomal P450s in the ferric state.
However, this catalytic activity was detected only at basal levels
(0.6–2.2 turnovers), and no further investigations in this
area have appeared in the literature over the following three decades.
In addition, compared to organic azides, iminoiodinanes are less attractive
as nitrene sources due to their poor atom economy. Here, we report
that cytochrome P450s constitute efficient catalysts for supporting
the formation of cyclic amines via the intramolecular C–H amination
of arylsulfonyl azides. Notably, Arnold and co-workers have very recently
described a similar reactivity for serine-ligated P450s (called P411s).26 Complementing and extending beyond this work,
the present study demonstrates that cysteine-ligated P450s are efficient
catalysts for the C–H amination of arylsulfonyl azides and
it provides first-time insights into the interplay of both electronic
and steric factors in affecting such reactivity. In addition, the
present work puts forth a mechanistic hypothesis that can explain
the formation of the amination products and byproducts from these
P450-catalyzed transformations, and building on the latter, it defines
initial mutagenesis strategies for enhancing the C–H amination
efficiency of these catalysts.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Reagents and Substrates
All solvents
and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich,
ACS Scientific, Acros) and used without any further purification,
unless stated otherwise. The compound 2,4,6 triisopropylsulfonyl
azide (1a) was purchased, whereas the other arylsulfonyl
azides (2a, 3a, 4–9) were synthesized according to the procedures provided in
the Supporting Information. Silica gel
chromatography purifications were carried out using AMD silica gel
60 230–400 mesh. Preparative thin-layer chromatography was
performed on TLC plates (Merck).

2.2 Protein
Expression and Purification
P450s were expressed from pCWori-based
plasmids containing the P450
gene under the control of a double tac promoter (BamH I/EcoR I cassette), as described previously.27 Typically, cultures of recombinant DH5α
cells in Terrific Broth (TB) medium (ampicillin, 100 mg L–1) were grown at 37 °C (200 rpm) until the OD600 reached
1.0, and they were then induced with 0.25 mM β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) and 0.3 mM δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). After induction,
cultures were shaken at 150 rpm and 27 °C and harvested after
20 h by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. Cells lysates were
prepared by sonication and loaded on a Q resin column. The protein
was eluted using 20 mM Tris, 340 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. After buffer exchange
(50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), the enzymes were stored
at −80 °C. P450 concentration was determined from CO-binding
difference spectra (ε450–490 = 91 000
M–1 cm–1). The vector encoding
for the thermostable phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) variant Opt13
was kindly provided by the Zhao group.6 PTDH was overexpressed from the pET-15b-based vector in BL21(DE3)
cells and purified using Ni-affinity chromatography according to the
published procedure.27

2.3 Enzymatic Reactions
The enzymatic
reactions were carried out at a 400 μL scale using 20 μM
P450, 10 mM substrate, and 10 mM sodium dithionite. In a typical procedure,
a solution containing sodium dithionate (100 mM stock solution) in
potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) was degassed by bubbling
argon into the mixture for 5 min in a sealed vial. A buffered solution
containing the P450 enzyme was carefully degassed in a similar manner
in a separate vial. The two solutions were then mixed together via
cannulation. Reactions were initiated by addition of 8 μL of
azide (from a 0.5 M stock solution in methanol) with a syringe, and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at room temperature, under
positive argon pressure. Reactions with NADPH as the reductant were
conducted following an identical procedure with the exception that
sodium dithionite was replaced with an NADPH solution in potassium
phosphate buffer (final concentration: 5 or 10 mM). Reactions with
hemin were carried out using an identical procedure with the exception
that the purified P450 was replaced with 80 μL of a hemin solution
(100 μM in DMSO/H2O, 1:1). The large-scale reaction
was carried out at 20 mL scale using degassed phosphate buffer containing
a cofactor regeneration system (0.5 mM PTDH, 1 mM NADPH, 50 mM sodium
phosphite), 30 mg of 3a, and purified FL#62 at a final
concentration of 40 μM.

2.4 Product
Analysis
The reactions were
analyzed by adding 20 μL of a guaiacol internal standard solution
(80 mM in methanol) to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction
with 400 μL of dichloromethane (DCM). The organic layer was
removed via evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue was resuspended
in 20 μL of DCM, and the products as well as the internal standard
were separated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC, 30%
EtOAc in hexane). From the TLC plates, all the products (and internal
standard) were collected and extracted with 100 μL of DCM. The
resulting solutions were then analyzed by GC-FID or GC-MS (see below).
Calibration curves of the different sultams were constructed using
synthetically produced sultams and the internal standard (Figure S3). All measurements were performed at
least in duplicate. For each experiment, negative control samples
containing either no enzyme or no reductant were included. For the
heat-inactivation experiments, the enzyme was preheated at 65 °C
for 10 min prior to use. For the CO-inactivation experiment, carbon
monoxide was bubbled through the reaction mixture containing the P450
enzyme and sodium dithionite prior to addition of the azide substrate.
For enantio- and stereoselectivity determination, the samples were
analyzed by supercritical fluid chromatography (see below). Authentic
standards of racemic (±)-2b and (±)-7b were synthesized as described in the Supporting
Information and used for calibration.

2.5 Analytical
Methods
Gas chromatography
(GC) analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph
equipped with a FID detector and a Shimadzu SHRXI-5MS column (15 m
× 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film). Separation method: 1 μL
injection; injector temp: 250 °C; detector temp: 220 °C.
Gradient: column temperature set at 60 °C for 1 min, then to
200 °C at 10 °C/min, then to 290 °C at 30 °C/min.
Total run time was 19.00 min. GC/MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu
GCMS-QP2010 equipped with a RTX-XLB column (30 m × 0.25 mm ×
0.28 μm) and a quadrupole mass analyzer. Separation method:
5 μL injection; inj. temp: 250 °C; detector temp: 220 °C.
Gradient: column temperature set at 60 °C for 1 min, then to
320 °C at 30 °C/min, then to 320 °C for 4 min. Total
run time was 13.67 min. Enantiomeric excess was determined by supercritical
fluid chromatography (JESCO SF-2000) using a Chiralpak IA chiral column
(4.6 m i.d. × 250 mm) and a mixture of CO2/isopropanol
(75:25) as the mobile phase. Total run time: 10.2 min.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Intramolecular C–H
Amination with 2,4,6-Trialkyl-benzenesulfonyl
Azides
Our studies began by testing the ability of cytochrome
P450BM3, a well-characterized and highly evolvable catalytically
self-sufficient P450 system from B. megaterium,28−30 to perform the desired intramolecular C–H amination reaction
in the presence of a series of 2,4,6-trisubstituted benzenesulfonyl
azides (1a–3a, Table 1). Excitingly, successful conversion of 2,4,6-triethyl-benzenesulfonyl
azide (2a) and 2,4,6-triisopropyl-benzenesulfonyl azide
(3a) to the desired benzosultam products (2b–3b) could be achieved under anaerobic conditions
in the presence of 0.2 mol % purified enzyme and sodium dithionite
(Na2S2O4, 10 mM). Under these conditions,
P450BM3 exhibits only modest activity on 2a (5 total turnovers (TTN)) but appreciable catalytic C–H amination
activity with 3a (20 TTN), the latter being about twice
as high as that observed with free hemin (12 TTN). In contrast, no
detectable amount of the desired cyclic amine was produced in both
the enzymatic and hemin reaction with 1. Subsequent experiments
indicated that the P450-mediated conversion of 3a (and 2a) can be also promoted by NADPH (10 mM), albeit with somewhat
lower catalytic efficiency (15 TTN). Omission of either reductant
(i.e., sodium dithionite or NADPH) from the reaction mixture resulted
in no product formation, indicating that the ferrous P450 is the catalytically
active form of the enzyme. The presence of air in the reaction vessel
also completely suppressed the P450-dependent C–H amination
activity.

In addition
to the C–H amination products, the reactions
with 2a and 3a also led to accumulation
of 2,4,6-triisopropyl- (3c) and 2,4,6-triethyl-benzenesulfonamide
(2c), respectively, as byproducts. As determined via
control experiments, NADPH, unlike dithionite, is unable to reduce
these azides to the corresponding sulfonamides. Thus, accumulation
of the latter in the NADPH-supported reactions indicated that this
species constitutes a product of the enzymatic reaction as well, likely
resulting from unproductive decomposition of the iron–nitrene
intermediate as discussed later. Additional control experiments were
performed in the presence of 3a and using either CO-saturated
buffer or heat-denatured P450BM3, both of which were expected
to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme. Observation of no or negligible
amounts of the sultam 3b or sulfonamide 3c unequivocally confirmed the direct involvement of the protein-coordinated
heme and properly folded P450, respectively, for the observed catalytic
C–H amination activity.

3.2 Engineered
P450BM3 Variants
Encouraged by these results,
we extended our studies to include a
set of engineered P450BM3-derived variants, namely, 139–3,31 J,32 and FL#62,27 which carry multiple (2 to 6) active-site mutations
compared to the parent enzyme (Table S1). These variants were chosen on the basis of their higher oxidation
activity across a variety of bulky, non-native substrates, as determined
in previous studies.27,33,34 These features suggested that these enzymes possess an enlarged
active site, which could thus better accommodate compounds 1a–3a as well as additional substrates tested later.
Gratifyingly, these engineered P450 variants, and in particular FL#62,
were found to exhibit enhanced C–H amination activity (Table 1). Most notably, FL#62 was determined to support
10- and 20-fold higher total turnovers for the cyclization of 2a (47 TTN) and 3a (388 TTN), respectively, compared
to P450BM3. In addition, FL#62 also showed detectable C–H
amination activity (5 TTN) on the compound with the least-activated
benzylic C–H bond within this substrate series (i.e., 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonyl
azide (1a)). In each case, the P450-catalyzed C–H
amination reactions with 2a and 3a were
found to proceed with absolute regioselectivity toward activation
of the benzylic position in the substrate, thus resulting in the corresponding
5-membered lactam rings. Another interesting observation concerns
the order of reactivity of all these P450s toward this set of structurally
related substrates, namely, 1a ≪ 2a ≪ 3a (Table 1). This
trend can be in part explained on the basis of the decreasing bond
dissociation energy associated with the benzylic C–H bond,
making it increasingly more reactive toward P450-catalyzed C–H
nitrene insertion. Other factors, however, contribute to influence
the reactivity of these catalysts as evidenced by subsequent studies.

3.3 Investigation of Substrate Scope
To further
explore the substrate scope of these P450-based C–H
amination catalysts, additional substrates were synthesized (see Supporting Information for details) and tested.
A first group of compounds comprised both unsubstituted and substituted
arylsulfonyl azides, containing a single isopropyl moiety in ortho to the sulfonyl azido group (4–6, Figure 1A). With 2-isopropylbenzene
sulfonyl azide 4, only FL#62 shows detectable C–H
amination activity (TTN: 5). Interestingly, the introduction of a
bulky substituent (—iPr, —CO2Me) in position
4 of the aromatic ring (5, 6) resulted in
more efficient conversion to the desired C–H amination products, 5b and 6b, respectively, by all the enzymes and
in particular by FL#62 (Figure 1B). With the
latter, TTN values in the range of 15–25 could be achieved.
Although these catalytic activities remain significantly (10- to 20-fold)
lower than those observed with 3a, they compare favorably
with those obtained using Ir- and Co-based catalysts on similar substrates
(30–50 TTN).9,16 To examine the impact of steric
influences at the level of the 2-alkyl moiety, compounds 7-9 were subsequently prepared and tested. Whereas only
minimal conversion to the desired cyclic amines (i.e., 1–2
TTN) were observed in the presence of the more sterically demanding 8 and 9, much higher C–H amination activity
was obtained with 7 and the engineered P450BM3 variants, with FL#62 supporting over 190 TTN on this substrate (Figure 1A, Table S2).

substrates and corresponding benzosultam products. (B) Measured TTNs
for the different P450 variants (see also Table
S2).

Although saturating substrate
concentrations (10 mM) were used
in the reactions above, we wondered whether differences in substrate
accessibility to the enzyme active site could account for the variation
in the C–H amination product yields observed in these experiments.
Repeating the reactions with FL#62 and 4–9 in the presence of NADPH revealed that in addition to the
cyclic amines, the corresponding arylsulfonamide byproducts were produced
in each case (Figure S1). These results
clearly indicated that all the substrates, including 8 and 9, could access the heme cofactor within the FL#62
active site. The sultam/sulfonamide ratio, however, varied significantly
across the different substrates (Figure S1). Collectively, these experiments suggested that additional factors,
besides the electronic effects mentioned above, strongly influence
whether the P450-catalyzed reaction proceeds through a productive
pathway, leading to the C–H amination product, versus a nonproductive
one, leading to the reduced sulfonamide.

3.3 Proposed
Mechanism for C–H Amination
Reaction
A possible mechanism for the P450-catalyzed C–H
amination reaction is provided in Scheme 1,
as formulated on the basis of our results and previous studies with
metalloporphyrins35−39 and nonheme iron systems.40−43 We envision that interaction of the azide substrate
with the ferrous heme center in the P450 forms an initial azido–iron(II)
complex, which ultimately leads to the formation of a imido–iron(IV)
species ((heme)FeIV = NSO2Ar) via extrusion
of N2. In a productive pathway, this reactive intermediate
would then engage the neighboring benzylic site in a nitrene C–H
bond insertion reaction (via a stepwise hydrogen-atom abstraction/radical
rebound or a concerted process) to give the cyclic amine. The P450-dependent
formation of the reduced arylsulfonamide also suggest competition
from a nonproductive pathway leading to this byproduct. Conceivably,
this species could be formed via direct reduction of the imido–iron(IV)
intermediate. Since water exchange at high-valent iron species in
P450s has been documented,25,44−46 a parallel or alternative pathway could involve hydrolysis of the
imido–iron(IV) intermediate followed by reduction of the resulting
oxo–iron(IV) species to give the ferrous heme. Beside the fact
that a ferrous heme was found to be essential for the observed C–H
amination activity, additional evidence in support of this mechanistic
hypothesis is our observation that stoichiometric amounts of NADPH
(with respect to the P450) are sufficient to support catalysis (e.g.,
18 TTN with FL#62 and 3a), but an excess of reducing
equivalents is required for supporting much higher total turnover
numbers (189 TTN with 250 equiv NADPH), possibly due to these competing
electron-consuming pathways.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation
of the Benzosultam and Benzosulfonamide
Products in the P450-Catalyzed Reactions
The observed structure–reactivity trends across
the various
arylsulfonyl azide substrates also deserve further comment. Particularly
intriguing are: (i) the large difference between the catalytic performance
of the enzymes with 7 versus 6 (e.g., FL#62:
192 vs 13 TTN, Table S2), which differ
merely by a single methyl group at the level of the 2-alkyl chain;
and (ii) the beneficial effect of the more remote meta substitutions in the benzene ring toward increasing the amount of
sultam product with substrates 5 and 6 as
compared to 4 (Figure 1). As noted
earlier, our experiments indicate that all of these substrates are
able to access the heme in FL#62, although only 5, 6, and 7 undergo efficient C–H amination
(Figure S1). Unlike the 1a–3a series, the structural differences within
this set of related substrates are not expected to have a major effect
on the inherent reactivity of the benzylic C–H bond. At the
same time, they are likely to affect the relative orientation of the
putative imido–iron(IV) intermediate within the enzyme active
site (Scheme 1). Thus, a possible explanation
for these results may be linked to the ability of these substituents
to favor a conformation of such intermediate that favors nitrene insertion
into the benzylic C–H bond over a nonproductive one leading
to the sulfonamide product. In this regard, it is instructive to note
how the substituents —COOMe (in 6) and —CH(CH3)2 (in 5), which have opposite electronic
but similar steric demands, lead to very similar benzosultam-to-sulfonamide
ratios (6.5% vs 5.5%, Figure S1).

3.4 T268A Mutation
While further studies
are ongoing to validate the mechanistic hypotheses outlined above,
an implication of our proposed mechanism is that protonation of the
imido–iron(IV) intermediate may be responsible for the formation
of the undesired sulfonamide byproduct. In P450BM3, a highly
conserved threonine residue (Thr268), which is located within the
I-helix in close proximity of the heme (Figure 2),47,48 is intimately involved in the protonation/stabilization
of heme-bound intermediates (e.g., hydroperoxo–iron species)
during the catalytic cycle of P450s as monooxygenases.49,50 Accordingly, a T268A mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis
into wild type P450BM3 and each of the variants in an attempt
to improve the C–H amination activity of these enzymes. Side-by-side
comparison of the catalytic performance of the T268A variants with
the corresponding parent enzymes revealed clear beneficial effects
resulting from the T268A mutation in the context of the P450-catalyzed
nitrene transfer reactions investigated here, although a certain dependence
on the nature of the parent enzyme and substrate was also observed
(Figure 1, Table S2). Indeed, this mutation led to a general increase in TTN for P450BM3(T268A) and J(T268A) but also a lower TTN for 139-3(T268A)
and FL#62(T268A), as compared to their respective parent enzymes.
Interestingly, a consistent enhancement of C–H amination activity
across all the enzymes was achieved as a result of the T268A substitution
with 2,4,6-triethylbenzenesulfonyl azide (2a). Indeed,
whereas P450BM3 shows modest C–H amination activity
on 2a (5 TTN), P450BM3(T268A) was found to
support more than 40 TTN on this substrate. Similarly, a 2- to 6-fold
increase in TTN was observed also for the T268A-containing variants
of 139-3, J, and FL#62 (Table S2).

of the active site cavity in the substrate-bound
structure of P450BM3 (pdb 1FAG48). The heme cofactor and Thr268 residue are highlighted in yellow
and purple, respectively. Active-site positions that are mutated in
the P450 variants tested in this study are also labeled (brown, see Table S1). The enzyme-bound substrate (palmitate)
and part of the protein structure are not shown for clarity.

To evaluate the impact of the
mutation on the sultam versus sulfonamide
ratio, reactions with these eight enzymes were repeated in the presence
of 2a as the substrate and NADPH as the reductant. For
each pair, a significant reduction in the fraction of the reduced
sulfonamide byproduct was observed as a result of the T268A substitution,
as illustrated by the data in Figure S2. Altogether, these data are consistent with our hypothesis that
the beneficial effect of this mutation may be linked to the suppression
of deleterious protonation mechanisms during P450-supported C–H
amination catalysis. In this regard, it is interesting to note that
mutation of the Thr268 residue was also found to enhance the activity
of P450BM3 and engineered variants thereof, as carbene
transfer catalysts,51,52 possibly via disruption of analogous
nonproductive proton-transfer-dependent processes. In the future,
it will be interesting to establish whether further improvements in
the C–H amination efficiency of these enzymes can be achieved
by targeting more remote amino acid residues involved in the proton
relay pathway in P450BM3.53 For
the time being, the differential performance of the various P450BM3 variants on the same substrate as described above and our
results with the T268A variants provide a first demonstration of the
possibility of modulating and enhancing the C–H amination activity
of these P450-based catalysts by means of active-site mutagenesis.

3.5 Enantio- and Stereoselectivity of P450 C–H
Amination Catalysts
Optically active benzosultams represent
valuable synthetic intermediates, which find use, for example, as
chiral auxiliaries.54−56 The heme pocket in P450 enzymes offers an inherently
asymmetric environment, in which the C–H amination reaction
could occur in an enantio- or stereoselective manner. To investigate
this aspect, we evaluated the enantiomeric excess produced by the
different P450BM3 variants in the presence of the prochiral
substrate 2a and the racemic substrate 7, thereby assessing the degree of stereo- and enantioselectivity,
respectively, exhibited by these catalysts. Notably, moderate to very
good asymmetric induction was observed in most cases (Table 2). In the case of 7, P450BM3(T268A) and 139-3 showed the largest degree of enantioselectivity,
also displaying enantiocomplementarity toward formation of the chiral
sultam 7b (55% and −66% ee, respectively). With 2a, the highest stereoselectivity was achieved with 139-3(T268A),
which produced the corresponding cyclic amine 2b in an
enantiomeric excess as high as 91%. Another noteworthy result was
the dramatic improvement in stereoselectivity (15→86% ee) as
a result of the single T268A mutation with P450 variant J and substrate 2a. Thus, besides altering the sultam to sulfonamide ratio
during conversion of 2a as discussed above, this mutation
can have also an impact on the stereoselectivity of the C–H
nitrene insertion process, likely due to the subtle change of the
active-site environment in close proximity to the putative imido–iron
intermediate of Scheme 1 (see also Figure 2). Clearly, further studies (e.g., via molecular
modeling) will be required to better understand the effect of the
active mutations on the stereo- and enantioselectivity of these enzymes,
including the apparent context-dependent effect of the T268A mutation
in either enhancing or decreasing such selectivity (Table 2). In the context of the present study, the aforementioned
results prove the viability of these P450-based catalysts to execute
asymmetric C–H amination reactions as well as the possibility
to tune their enantio- and stereoselectivity via manipulation of their
active site.

3.6 Scalability of P450-Catalyzed C–H Amination
Reaction
Finally, a preparative-scale transformation was
set up using 0.4 mol % FL#62, substrate 3a (30 mg), and
a phosphite dehydrogenase-based NADPH cofactor regeneration system.57 From this reaction, benzosultam 3b could be isolated in 42% yield, which provided a proof-of-principle
demonstration of the scalability of these enzymatic reactions.

4 Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrates the
potential of cytochrome
P450 enzymes to provide efficient catalysts for the intramolecular
C–H amination of arylsulfonyl azide substrates. In the parallel
work by McIntosh et al.,26 it was proposed
that substitution of the heme proximal ligand cysteine with serine
is necessary for conferring P450s with C–H amination reactivity.
The present study clearly shows that cysteine–heme-ligated
P450s can support this chemical transformation with equal or even
higher efficiency. Whether the C–H amination reactivity of
the catalysts described here can be further enhanced and modulated
by modification of the heme environment remains an open question which
will be addressed in the future. Importantly, the present work further
shows how the substrate scope, C–H amination activity, and
enantio- and stereoselectivity of these catalysts could be effectively
altered and tuned by utilizing different active-site enzyme variants
and through protein engineering. In particular, building on preliminary
hypotheses regarding the mechanism underlying this newly discovered
reactivity of P450 enzymes, our results suggest that disrupting the
native proton relay pathway in P450s can provide a route for enhancing
the C–H amination efficiency of these catalysts. Further work
is ongoing toward validating the proposed mechanism and further capitalizing
on these initial findings.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes constitute
attractive catalytic platforms
for oxygen-atom transfer reactions.31,58−65 The present study expands the scope of these biocatalysts to include
a most valuable nitrene transfer reactivity, which has so far remained
undocumented for naturally occurring enzymes and restricted to synthetic
transition-metal-based catalysts. As illustrated by notable recent
examples,52,66 the possibility to leverage natural or artificial
enzyme scaffolds for “non-native” chemical transformations
is bound to disclose exciting, new opportunities toward their exploitation
for synthetic applications.
