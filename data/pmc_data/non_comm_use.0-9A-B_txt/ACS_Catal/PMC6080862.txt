Insights
into the mechanism of the catalytic cycle for methanol
dehydrogenation catalyzed by a highly active PNP pincer ruthenium
complex in methanol solvent are presented, using DFT-based molecular
dynamics with an explicit description of the solvent, as well as static
DFT calculations using microsolvation models. In contrast to previous
results, we find the amido moiety of the catalyst to be permanently
protonated under catalytic conditions. Solvent molecules actively
participate in crucial reaction steps and significantly affect the
reaction barriers when compared to pure gas-phase models, which is
a direct result of the enhanced solvent stabilization of methoxide
anion intermediates. Further, the calculations reveal that this system
does not operate via the commonly assumed Noyori-type outer-sphere
metal–ligand cooperative pathway. Our results show the importance
of incorporating a molecular description of the solvent to gain a
deeper and accurate understanding of the reaction pathways, and stress
on the need to involve explicit solvent molecules to model complex
catalytic processes in a realistic manner.

Development of a hydrogen economy
is a promising path to address increasing global energy needs. The
primary energy carrier in such an economy, dihydrogen, has a high
gravimetric energy density and provides clean and carbon-free conversion.
However, the use of dihydrogen as a fuel is limited by its low volumetric
energy density under ambient conditions. Moreover, molecular hydrogen
is difficult to produce, store and transport. Liquid organic fuels
(LOFs), such as alcohols, provide a viable alternative in this regard.
LOFs work on the principle of a reversible hydrogen storage mechanism.
For example, three equiv of H2 can be stored in one molecule
of CO2 by the reduction of CO2 to MeOH (and
water). Systems that can perform reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation
of CO2/MeOH can play a central role in establishing a hydrogen
economy with MeOH as the primary energy carrier. Homogeneous molecular
catalysts offer high selectivity and activity under ambient conditions
to realize these conversions in an efficient manner. Various systems
have been developed for conversion of MeOH to CO2 and H2,1−7 and the reverse reaction as well.8−11

Beller and co-workers reported
the first catalytic system for low
temperature aqueous methanol dehydrogenation using a ruthenium pincer
complex 1′ (RuH(CO)Cl(HN(C2H4PiPr2)2)) as the
catalytic precursor.1 The active catalyst
complex 1 is capable of dehydrogenation of methanol–water
mixtures with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 4700 h–1 and is highly stable (TON > 350 000). A number of other
homogeneous
(pincer and nonpincer type) Fe, Ru, Ir, and Mn catalysts bearing R2N amido donors (sometimes proposed to be in situ generated
from R2NH amine donors) in a chelating ligand framework
have also been reported,2,5,12−14 demonstrating the versatility of this class of complexes
for methanol dehydrogenation.

For most of these catalysts outer-sphere
Noyori-type mechanisms
are typically proposed, involving proton transfer to the amido ligand
and hydride transfer to the metal in the MeOH activation steps (Scheme 1). Similarly, a cooperative
action of the thus formed amine ligand donor and the metal hydride
resulting in hydride-proton coupling is generally assumed to account
for H2 liberation and regeneration of the amido catalyst
(Scheme 1). A shortcoming
of most of these catalytic systems is the need for additives (base
or Lewis acid cocatalyst) to achieve optimal performance. From a fundamental
chemical perspective, a catalyst with a cooperative ligand, containing
an internal amido-base and operating via an outer-sphere Noyori type
mechanism15 for acceptorless dehydrogenation
of an alcohol should not require any additives. As such, it is quite
remarkable that Beller’s Ru-PNP complexes were reported to
operate via metal–ligand cooperative pathways, but yet perform
optimally under highly basic conditions (8 M KOH). On the other hand,
it has been demonstrated that MeOH dehydrogenation can be carried
out under additive free conditions by choosing a different catalyst
design principle, albeit with lower activity.2

Scheme 1 Generally Proposed Noyori Type Cooperative Pathways for Acceptorless
Dehydrogenation of Alcohols, in a Gas-Phase Context (left) and the
Structure of Complex 1 Used in This Study (Right)
Previous experimental and computational studies
have rationalized
the mechanism of dehydrogenation of methanol by complex 1 mostly in the framework of a Noyori-type mechanism.16,17 This assumes a cooperative action of the amido ligand and the metal
center in the proton and hydride transfer steps, with MeOH dehydrogenation
proceeding via simultaneous hydride transfer to the metal upon deprotonation
of the alcohol by the amido moiety. In the second step, H2 liberation from the catalyst is proposed to proceed via a proton-hydride
coupling process with proton transfer from the amine donor to the
metal hydride moiety, thus leading to regeneration of the amido moiety
(Scheme 1). Note that,
in all proposed mechanisms, protonation and deprotonation of the amido
ligand are considered to be key steps of the catalytic cycle. Beller
and co-workers proposed a base (OH–) assisted pathway
for dehydrogenation of methanol by complex 1.16 The base was assumed to deprotonate the amine
moiety of complex 2 to generate the anionic complex 2–. Subsequent rearrangement
of the methoxide moiety in complex 2– was proposed to be followed by a hydride transfer to the metal
center to produce 3–.
Successive N-protonation of the latter by a solvent molecule was anticipated
to generate the hydrogenated complex 3 and formaldehyde,
followed by dehydrogenation of complex 3 leading to evolution
of H2 and regeneration of complex 1 to complete
the catalytic cycle.

Given the fact that the experimental catalytic
reactions are performed
in protic solvent mixtures (MeOH/H2O), thus providing a
strong hydrogen bonding environment, one might anticipate that the
previous mechanistic pictures based on gas phase DFT calculations
are incomplete. The solvation effects of protic solvents are likely
to have a strong influence on the proton and hydride transfer steps.
Both the MeOH activation and the H2 formation steps might
proceed via methoxide intermediates, where the strong hydrogen bonds
with the negatively charged oxygen are crucial for a proper description
of the relative stability of these intermediates. Moreover, in a protic solvent
the solvent molecules might compete with the catalyst as the proton
source. These scenarios could not be accounted for in previous computational
studies,16,17 that did not account for solvent or incorporated
solvent by a continuum model at most complemented by a single solvent
molecule. The importance of an explicit (finite-temperature) description
of the solvent has been demonstrated for other catalytic processes,18 including water splitting19−21 and transfer
hydrogenation of ketones.22−24

To capture the effects
of explicit solvent molecules, we employ
a combined approach of ab initio molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) of an
explicitly solvated periodic system, and static density functional
theory (DFT) simulations of gas-phase and microsolvated systems. Full
details are provided in the Supporting Information (SI). Our results reveal the active participation of solvent in
this important reaction, as it has a nontrivial effect in the C–H
activation and hydrogen production pathways. On this basis, we propose
a new catalytic pathway for methanol oxidation catalyzed by complex 1 (Scheme 2), significantly different from all previously proposed mechanisms.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Methanol Oxidation with Explicit Solvent (Top)
and (Bottom) Important Complexes in This Study
Blue dashed lines in complex 2-H2O+/2-CH3OH+ show
interactions with the solvent. The proton
in the NH moiety of complexes 2-H2O+ and 2-CH3OH+ originates
from the solvent. In the nomenclature of complexes in this manuscript,
the subscript 1m denotes interaction with one methanol
solvent molecule, and the subscript 2m denotes interactions
with two methanol solvent molecules.

An important
first observation from our DFT-MD simulations with
explicit solvent, either in water or in methanol, was the spontaneous
protonation of the ligand nitrogen atom of complex 1 by
a solvent molecule. The amido moiety remained protonated during the
entire DFT-MD simulation (25 ps). This process was accompanied by
the coordination of an additional ligand such as H2O, CH3O– or MeOH to the metal center, forming
complexes 2-H2O+, 22m, and 2-CH3OH+ respectively. This suggests that the solvent/substrate saturated
18 valence electron octahedral ruthenium(II) species with a protonated
amido moiety is a very stable species. To quantify the stability of
this compound with respect to amido deprotonation, we determined the
free energy change upon deprotonation of the NH moiety of complex 2-H2O+ by a solvent water molecule in aqueous solution using DFT-MD
simulations, with the chosen reaction coordinate (Q) imposing a proton transfer, involving cleavage of the N–H
bond and simultaneous formation of an O–H bond (resulting in
H3O+) (see SI). The
computed value of +35 kcal mol–1 (corresponding
to a pKa of ∼25), demonstrates
the high stability of the N–H bond, and the high basicity of
the amido moiety in the PNP ligand (see SI for details). Therefore, even under very basic conditions complex 22m should remain
protonated. In addition, using static DFT calculations the deprotonation
of complex 2 by a microsolvated hydroxide moiety (that
is present in such highly basic conditions) was found to be uphill
by +12 kcal mol–1 (se SI), further demonstrating the high proton affinity of the amido moiety.
Based on these results, it is evident that complex 22m, with the protonated ligand
nitrogen, is the resting state of this catalytic system under the
experimentally applied reaction conditions (8 M KOH in a 9:1 MeOH/H2O mixture).

Having established the resting state of
this catalytic system,
we first studied the oxidation of methanol catalyzed by complex 22m to form formaldehyde.
Complex 22m undergoes
an endergonic rearrangement to form complex 22m′, where the methoxide moiety interacts with the metal center via
an agostic C–H–Ru interaction (the methoxide is also
hydrogen bonded to the N–H moiety of the PNP ligand). The simulations
indicate a direct hydride transfer from this methoxide moiety to the
ruthenium center, resulting in the formation of CH2O and
complex 3. Using DFT-MD with an explicit description
of methanol solvent (see SI), we determined
the free energy profile for this hydride transfer process using a
biasing scheme, as shown in Figure 1 (top panel). The chosen hydride transfer reaction
coordinate (Q) that involves the cleavage of a C–H
bond and the simultaneous formation of a Ru–H bond is shown
in the inset of Figure 1 (top panel), and was varied between −0.9 and 1.0 Å.
To quantify the role of the solvent, we also performed static DFT
calculations of the corresponding hydride transfer pathway without
(gas-phase), and with two explicit MeOH solvent molecules. Results
for the minimum energy reaction pathway (MERP) are shown in Figure 1 (bottom panel).
Note that the static DFT calculations are performed using a GGA functional
(BP86) for a direct comparison with the DFT-MD results (BLYP). However,
a hybrid functional like M06 was also explored and gave quantitatively
similar results, as described in the SI. For a direct comparison with the free energy profile obtained via
DFT-MD calculations, where the reference state is a solvated form
of complex 2′, the TS barriers obtained using
static DFT calculations in Figure 1 have been referenced with respect to complex 2′ (and complex 22m′ for the
microsolvated pathway).

The reaction coordinate Q is specified in the left
inset. The right inset shows a representative configuration at the
initial stage (Q = −0.9 Å), showing the

(bottom). The calculated MERP (Gibbs free energy in kcal mol–1) with static DFT (BP86/def2-TZVP), using a gas-phase
model (black) and an explicit microsolvation model with two additional
MeOH molecules (red).

The calculations show that the presence of explicit solvent
molecules
leads to a substantially higher transition state
barrier (an increase >5 kcal mol–1) for formaldehyde
formation when compared to the gas-phase results. This effect can
be directly attributed to the increased stabilization of the methoxide
adduct in solution, due to its ability to form three strong hydrogen
bonds (inset right panel in Figure 1). The reaction involves transfer of the negative charge
from the oxygen on the methoxide moiety to the σ* orbital of
the C–H bond, leading to hydride transfer to the metal. Effective
solvation of the methoxide anion by the H-bond donating protic solvent
molecules stabilizes the negative charge and thereby increases the
barrier of the hydride transfer process (Figure 2).

methoxide anion and
a methoxide anion hydrogen bonded to three MeOH molecules (distances
in Å).

Also for the hydrogen
releasing steps under (micro)solvation conditions,
we arrive at a different mechanism than previously proposed. Our calculations
show that the reaction proceeds by a direct protonation of the metal
hydride by a solvent molecule. The reaction barrier that we obtained
for hydrogen production from complex 3 with explicit
methanol solvent was +7 kcal mol–1 (Figure 3, top). The chosen proton-transfer
reaction coordinate (Q) that involves the cleavage of the O–H
bond and the simultaneous protonation of the Ru–H bond is shown
in the inset of Figure 3 (top), and sampled between values of −0.4 and 1.6 Å.
Interestingly, the ligand nitrogen remains protonated throughout the
reaction in solution, further demonstrating its strong proton affinity.
To incorporate the effect of explicit solvent molecules in static
DFT calculations, we studied the dehydrogenation process in the presence
of two methanol molecules. One of the methanol molecules protonates
the metal-hydride bond to form the dihydrogen complex 22m–H2. The resulting transition state barrier
for dehydrogenation is significantly lower (a decrease
of 6 kcal mol–1) than the corresponding activation
barrier for dehydrogenation when hydrogen production is mediated by
one methanol molecule (Figure 3, bottom).16,17 This remarkable effect can be
attributed to the stabilization of the methoxide that is formed as
the reaction proceeds, by hydrogen bonding to the protic solvent molecules.
Release of dihydrogen and rearrangement of the methoxide species to
coordinate with the metal center, regenerates the starting complex 22m upon solvation
by an extra methanol solvent molecule.

The calculated MERP (Gibbs free energy in kcal mol–1) obtained from static DFT (BP86/def2-TZVP) using
an explicit microsolvation model involving one (black) and two (red)
additional MeOH molecules.

It is important to note at this point that the computed MeOH
oxidation
and hydrogen releasing steps under (micro)solvation conditions (Scheme 3) are substantially
different from the previously reported Noyori-type cooperative dehydrogenation
steps shown in Scheme 1. Clearly, the NH moiety does not get deprotonated under the applied
conditions to function as a cooperative ligand, and it is neither
directly involved in the dihydrogen releasing steps. However, the
NH moiety of the PNP pincer ligand might still be important, as it
could function as a supramolecular directing group, assisting the
hydride transfer process to the metal by positioning the methoxide
in a proper orientation by H-bonding to the methoxide in the transition
state for hydride transfer. Similarly, it directs the proton of the
reacting MeOH molecule to the metal hydride moiety in a hydrogen-bonding
chain involving the NH moiety of the PNP ligand in TS-22m for hydrogen production.
So, if any, it is actually the NH moiety of the PNP ligand that acts
in a cooperative manner with the metal in the key steps of the catalytic
cycle rather than the commonly assumed amido moiety.24,25 In these key steps, the NH moiety does not play a direct role.

Scheme 3 Catalytic Pathway with an Explicit Solvation Model for Methanol Oxidation
(Top) and (Bottom) Hydrogen Production
Gibbs free energy values are
shown in kcal mol–1. Note that in the experimental
system these reactions are driven by removal of H2 (and
CH2O).

Evidence for a similar nondirect
role of a amido moiety has been
reported for metal catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of ketones.22,23,26 These observations can be indicative
for the more general notion that (de)hydrogenation reactions involving
cooperative amido ligands could proceed via reaction steps similar
to those observed in the present study when performed in a polar,
protic solvent. The pKa of the NH moiety,
quantifying its protonation state, will be one of the determining
factors for the way it participates in the catalytic cycle.

In summary, we have studied methanol dehydrogenation by a highly
active ruthenium pincer complex 1′ using a combination
of ab initio molecular dynamics and static DFT calculations in the
presence of an explicit solvent. The ligand nitrogen of amido complex 1, which was previously believed to be a key catalytic intermediate,
was found to have a high proton affinity in polar, protic solvents,
resulting in complex 22m being the actual resting state species of the catalytic cycle.
This suggests that the earlier proposed catalytic pathways for methanol
dehydrogenation involving Noyori-type cooperative involvement of a
ligand amido moiety are not feasible, as they are based on the existence
of deprotonated complexes 2– and 3– as resting
states.16 The stability of these complexes
was most likely overestimated in ref (16). by neglecting the explicit effects of solvent.
Our result for the stability of complex 22m also suggests that the enhancing effect
of strong base on the activity of the catalyst is not correlated to
the deprotonation of the NH moiety in the PNP ligand. For both the
methanol oxidation and the dihydrogen formation steps, DFT-MD simulations
show that incorporating a polar, protic solvent substantially influences
the relative reaction energies. These differences can be rationalized
by considering hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules, which affects
the relative energies of the reactants, transition states and products.
Static DFT calculations including a small number of explicit solvent
molecules can be used to accurately model these same solvent effects,
even in a quantitative manner. Our calculations, which account for
explicit solvent effects, clearly demonstrate the rate limiting step
for methanol dehydrogenation to formaldehyde to be a direct hydride
transfer process from the C–H bond of a methoxide anion to
ruthenium. This observation is in excellent agreement with the need
to use high base concentrations in the experimental reactions, as
a higher methoxide concentration will of course be beneficial for
efficient hydride transfer, lowering the barrier of the rate-limiting
step of the catalytic cycle under such nonstandard thermodynamic conditions.

Additionally, the hydrogen production step proceeds via direct
protonation of ruthenium hydride moiety by a solvent molecule, while
the ligand nitrogen remains protonated throughout the reaction, and
therefore cannot act as an internal base for the deprotonation of
methanol. Apparently, the “non-innocent/cooperative”
amido moiety of the PNP ligand does not seem to play a direct role
in catalysis, rather it could facilitate substrate/solvent orientations
via hydrogen bonding. This may well be a manifestation of a more general
(design) principle for metal-based (de)hydrogenation catalysis in
protic solvents.
