The
heme enzyme chlorite dismutase (Cld) catalyzes the degradation
of chlorite to chloride and dioxygen. Although structure and steady-state
kinetics of Clds have been elucidated, many questions remain (e.g.,
the mechanism of chlorite cleavage and the pH dependence of the reaction).
Here, we present high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of a dimeric
Cld at pH 6.5 and 8.5, its fluoride and isothiocyanate complexes and
the neutron structure at pH 9.0 together with the pH dependence of
the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, and the UV–vis and resonance Raman
spectral features. We demonstrate that the distal Arg127 cannot act
as proton acceptor and is fully ionized even at pH 9.0 ruling out
its proposed role in dictating the pH dependence of chlorite degradation.
Stopped-flow studies show that (i) Compound I and hypochlorite do
not recombine and (ii) Compound II is the immediately formed redox
intermediate that dominates during turnover. Homolytic cleavage of
chlorite is proposed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chlorite dismutases (Clds) are heme b-containing
oxidoreductases (EC 1.13.11.49) found in prokaryotic organisms.1 They are able to efficiently decompose chlorite
(ClO2– or OClO–) into
harmless chloride (Cl–) and dioxygen (O2) with chlorite being the sole source of dioxygen.2 Thereby, a covalent oxygen–oxygen bond is formed,
a biochemical reaction that was believed to be unique to the water-splitting
manganese complex of photosystem II of oxygenic organisms.3

The ability to degrade chlorite was shown
for several functional
(i.e., efficiently chlorite degrading) Clds, all of them possessing
a putatively flexible arginine in an otherwise hydrophobic distal
heme pocket. Available X-ray crystal structures reveal two distinct
conformations, either pointing toward the heme iron (“in”;
e.g., chlorite dismutase from Dechloromonas aromatica (DaCld), PDB: 3Q08)4,5 or toward the substrate entry channel (“out”;
e.g., chlorite dismutase from Nitrospira defluvii (NdCld), PDB: 3NN1).6

The mechanism of chlorite cleavage
is still under discussion. Computational
studies suggest homolytic cleavage of OClO– thereby
producing chlorine monoxide (ClO•) and Compound
II [Por···Fe(IV)=O], followed by a rebinding
step and production of Fe(III)–peroxyhypochlorite that finally
releases chloride and dioxygen (Reactions I and II).7 Binding of the anionic substrate chlorite (pKa = 1.728) to ferric
Cld is exergonic7 and independent of the
Cld-typical arginine.9 I   II  

By contrast, biochemical studies on pentameric Clds suggest heterolytic
cleavage of chlorite thereby forming Compound I [Por+•···Fe(IV)=O] and hypochlorite (HOCl/–OCl) (Reaction III).10−14 The following rebinding step produces Fe(III)–peroxyhypochlorite
and, in consequence, chloride and dioxygen (Reaction IV). III   IV  

In contrast to KM, the turnover number
(kcat) of Clds show a clear dependence
on pH.11 The pH optimum of chlorite degradation
is typically in the acidic pH range, and the turnover number decreases
with rising pH. It has been postulated that the pH dependence of this
reaction reflects the protonation state of the strictly conserved
flexible distal arginine, which was reported to possess a pKa of ∼6.5 in DaCld14 and NdCld,11 both clade 1 members
(see next paragraph). It was suggested that this basic amino acid
supports both heterolytic cleavage of chlorite (Reaction III) and the recombination
reaction between the postulated intermediate hypochlorite and Compound
I (Reaction IV). Elimination
of the distal Arg by mutation significantly decreases kcat and boosts the extent of irreversible inactivation.
The latter event was proposed to be promoted by released hypochlorous
acid, since scavengers of (HOCl/–OCl) are able to
suppress inactivation and increase the extent of degraded chlorite.11 It should be noted that the exclusiveness of
such scavengers for (HOCl/–OCl) is questionable,
and it is not fully clear whether they would also detect chlorine
monoxide or chlorine dioxide.

The known functional Clds can
be divided into two phylogenetically
distinct clades 1 and 2, which differ in subunit size and oligomerization.
So far, biochemical and structural research has mainly focused on
the pentameric and hexameric clade 1 proteins,6,10−17 whereas only few studies have addressed dimeric clade 2 Clds from Nitrobacter winogradskyi (NwCld),18Klebsiella pneumonia MGH
78578 (KpCld),19 and Cyanothece sp. PCC7425 (CCld).20 The present study
provides the first comprehensive structural and biochemical investigation
of a dimeric clade 2 chlorite dismutase (i.e., CCld) and focuses on
comprehensive structural and mechanistic studies including the impact
of pH on chlorite conversion.

In contrast to pentameric Clds,
the spectral features of CCld in
various redox states are shown to be better resolved and easier to
assign. We report the pH dependence of (i) the pre-steady-state kinetics
of the reaction of ferric CCld with both ClO2– and the putative reaction intermediate (HOCl/–OCl), (ii) the reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple,
and (iii) the UV–vis and resonance Raman spectra of the ferrous
and ferric forms. We provide high-resolution X-ray structures of CCld
at pH 6.5 (1.30 Å) and pH 8.5 (1.55 Å) as well as of its
fluoride (1.18 Å) and isothiocyanate (1.28 Å) complexes
at pH 6.5. Moreover, we present the first neutron structure of a ferric
heme enzyme from this superfamily solved at pH 9.0 to a resolution
of 2.35 Å together with the X-ray structure at room temperature.
Our data demonstrate that the distal Arg is protonated at pH 9.0 and
indicate that ClO• is the product of chlorite cleavage,
at least in the O2 generative part of the reaction. This
contradicts the hypothesis that the protonation state of the catalytic
arginine modulates chlorite degradation.

On the basis of our
data, we discuss the postulated mechanism(s)
of chlorite conversion and provide a more detailed view of the mode
of action including potential side reactions catalyzed by the enzyme.

2 Results
2.1 Impact of pH on the Spectral
Properties of
Dimeric Ferric and Ferrous CCld
The electronic absorption
and resonance Raman (RR) spectra of ferric CCld are presented in Figure 1. The electronic
absorption spectrum at acidic pH (i.e., 5.9) of the ferric protein
(Figure 1a, spectrum
(i), characterized by a Soret band at 406 nm, Q-bands at 503, 540,
and 590 nm, and a charge-transfer (CT1) band at 636 nm, suggests a
mixture of high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) species.

Figure 1 (a) Electronic absorption
and (b) high-frequency RR spectra of
ferric CCld at pH 5.9 and pH 9.6. Experimental conditions: UV–vis:
(a) 600 nm/min scan rate. The region between 450 and 700 nm has been
expanded 8-fold. (b) RR: 413.1 nm exc., 5 mW laser power at the sample,
and 10 min integration time. The region between 1450 and 1700 cm–1 has been expanded 2-fold. The intensity of the spectra
is normalized to that of the ν4 band.

This is confirmed by the corresponding high-frequency
RR spectrum
(Figure 1b, bottom),
which clearly indicates a mixture of three species; an aquo 6-coordinate
(6c) HS (ν3 at 1485 cm–1, ν2 at 1562 cm–1), a 5-coordinate (5c) HS (ν3 at 1491 cm–1), and a 6cLS (ν3 at 1506 cm–1, ν10 at 1641
cm–1). Furthermore, ferric CCld is characterized
by two coincident vinyl stretching modes at 1629 cm–1 as for myoglobin, which downshift to 1626 in the ferrous form (Figure S1b, spectrum a). The low-frequency RR
spectrum (Figure S2, spectrum a) of ferric
CCld at pH 5.8 is characterized by intense bands at 370 cm–1, due to the propionyl bending modes, and at 413 and 435 cm–1 due to the vinyl bending modes.

Figure S3a,b depicts the UV–vis
spectral changes of CCld as a function of pH between pH 3.0 and 10.0,
and pH 5.8 and 12.0, respectively. The pKa of the
alkaline transition (i.e., deprotonation of the distal water) was
calculated to be 8.1 ± 0.04.

At alkaline pH, the absorption
spectrum (Figure 1a,
top) becomes typical of a hydroxo-complex,
characterized by a mixture of 6cHS and 6cLS species with a Soret band
at 414 nm, Q bands at 540 and 575 nm, and a weak CT1 band at 610 nm.
This is consistent with the high-frequency RR spectrum (Figure 1b, top) which displays a predominant
6cLS species (ν3 1506, ν2 1580,
ν37 1605, ν10 1641 cm–1) and a weak 6cHS form (ν3 1478 cm–1). Accordingly, in the low-frequency region the ν(Fe–OH)
stretching modes of the heme-hydroxide complexes have been identified
by their sensitivity to 2H and 18O isotopic
substitution (Figure S4a and Table S1)
and on the basis of the difference spectra and curve fitting analysis
(Figure S4b). The isotopic shifts observed
for the 18O and 2H labeled species are in good
agreement with those calculated using the diatomic harmonic oscillator
model (Table S2). The LS and HS ν(Fe–OH)
stretching modes have been assigned to the bands at the 510 and 485
cm–1, respectively (Figure 2a). It is noted that while the 6cLS is very
similar to that found for DaCld and KpCld (514 and 509 cm–1, respectively), the 6cHS is more than 40 cm–1 higher
(440 and 442 cm–1 in DaCld14 and KpCld,19 respectively).

Figure 2 Low-frequency
RR spectra of CCld. (a) ferric (pH 9.6), (b) ferrous,
and (c) ferrous-CO at pH 5.8 showing the frequencies of the Fe-hydroxide
LS, (red) and HS, (blue), Fe-Im, and the ν(Fe-CO) stretching
and δ(FeCO) modes, respectively. Experimental: 413.1 nm (ferric
and CO complex) and 441.6 nm (ferrous) exc.; (a) 5 mW laser power
at the sample, average of 12 spectra with 120 min integration time;
(b) 11 mW laser power at the sample, 2 spectra with 20 min integration
time; (c) 5 mW laser power at the sample, average of 4 spectra with
40 min integration time.

The electronic absorption and RR spectra of the reduced protein
clearly indicate the presence of a pure 5cHS state (Figure S1a,b, spectra (i)). It is noted that the spectrum
of ferrous CCld is invariant in the pH interval 5.8–9.8 (data
not shown). The low-frequency RR spectrum of ferrous 5cHS hemes is
of interest particularly due to the presence of a strong band resulting
from the iron-imidazole stretching mode, ν(Fe-Im), in the range
of 200–250 cm–1. The ν(Fe-Im) frequency
is very sensitive to H-bonding interactions and, therefore, to the
protein matrix surrounding the proximal His114 residue (CCld numbering).21,22 The intense band at 231 cm–1 observed for ferrous
CCld at pH 5.8 (Figure 2b and Figure S2c) (higher than that observed
for DaCld14 at 222 cm–1 but similar to that observed for KpCld19) is assigned to the ν(Fe-Im) mode, a frequency somewhat higher
than that observed in myoglobin (220 cm–1), where
the proximal His is hydrogen bonded to a weak H-bond acceptor.

2.2 Reactions of Ferric CCld with Hypochlorite
Hypochlorous
acid is known to function as a two-electron oxidant
that converts ferric peroxidases and catalases to the redox intermediate
Compound I.23,24 In functional chlorite dismutases,
the oxidation of ferric Cld by chlorite is proposed to transiently
form hypochlorite (Reaction III) which is rapidly consumed in the subsequent recombination
reaction (Reaction IV). Consequently, we asked whether ferric Cld can be oxidized by hypochlorite
to Compound I followed by recombination of the latter with excess
OCl–.

Thus, we followed the reaction of CCld
with hypochlorite (HOCl/–OCl, pKa = 7.53) spectrophotometrically using the stopped-flow
technique (Figure 3a–d) and polarographically using a Clark-type electrode (Figure 3e). At pH 5.0, effective
Compound I formation can be observed (Figure 3a, red spectrum) with an apparent second-order
rate constant of 2.5 × 106 M–1 s–1 (Figure 3c).

Figure 3 Reaction of ferric CCld with hypochlorite (HOCl/-OCl). (a) Spectral changes of 1.5 μM CCld upon reaction with
13 μM hypochlorite at pH 5.0. Black: ferric CCld; red: Compound
I; blue: Compound II-like species. For better visualization of the
CT and Q bands, the 460–700 nm region is magnified 6-fold.
Arrows illustrate the course of the reaction by both their colors
and directions. (b) Corresponding time traces at 406 nm (ferric Soret
maximum) and 418 nm (Soret maximum of Compound II-like species). Left:

at pH 9.0. Black: ferric CCld; red and blue: intermediate spectra
exhibiting ferric low-spin features. Peak maxima are labeled. (e)
Reaction of 1.5 μM CCld with 20 μM chlorite at pH 5.0
(red) and with 40 μM hypochlorite at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 (black)
followed by polarographic measurements using a Clark-type electrode.
The negative control (no substrate) is shown in gray and reflects
the amount of oxygen that is introduced to the O2-free
system by triggering the reaction with enzyme solution.

For the depicted spectra and time traces at pH
5.0, 1.5 μM
CCld and 13 μM hypochlorite were used. After 0.074 s, the Soret
peak exhibits 50% hypochromicity, and a distinct band at 650 nm has
emerged. Above a ∼6-fold excess of hypochlorite, a slow shift
of Compound I to a Compound II-like species (Soret maximum at 418
nm and Q bands at 528 and 551 nm) is observed (Figure 3a, blue spectrum). Finally, the enzyme slowly
returns to the ferric resting state (Figure 3b, time trace at 406 nm). The maximum abundance
of the Compound II-like species is reached after ∼6.8 s. At
all hypochlorite concentrations tested, heme bleaching could be observed
to some extent.

At pH 7.0, using the same concentrations of
enzyme and substrate,
Compound I formation is about 4 times faster (9.6 × 106 M–1 s–1, data not shown) compared
to pH 5.0. However, it overlaps to a greater extent with the evolution
of the Compound II-like species (418, 528, and 551 nm) which is already
fully developed after ∼0.3 s, approximately 23 times faster
than at pH 5.0. At pH 9.0, the resting state of CCld exhibits a Soret
band at 414 nm reflecting the presence of the OH–-complex described above. It does not directly react with hypochlorite.
Only at higher concentration of oxidant, a very slow bathochromic
shift is observed (Figure 3d). The final spectrum is similar to that of the CCld-cyanide
complex. The nature of the ligand is unclear, one possibility is chlorate
which can form upon disproportionation of hypochlorite.25 However, no spectral change could be observed
upon incubation of CCld with chlorate at pH 9.0 (data not shown).

Importantly, at no pH studied (i.e., pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0), could
any O2 generation be observed polarographically upon mixing
1.5 μM CCld with 40 μM hypochlorite (Figure 3e).

2.3 Chlorite
Decomposition by Ferric CCld at Different
pH Values
Recently we reported the steady-state kinetics
of chlorite degradation of CCld and its pH dependence.20 The completeness of chlorite degradation as
well as the initial reaction velocity increased with decreasing pH.
At pH 5.0, the chlorite-degrading activity of CCld was found to have
a kcat value of 1144 ± 23.8 s–1, a KM of 162 ± 10.0
μM, and a catalytic efficiency of (7.1 ± 0.6) × 106 M–1 s–1. Reactions below
pH 4.0 could not be followed due to enzyme denaturation.

In
the present work, we studied the pH-dependent degradation of chlorite
by CCld using UV–vis stopped-flow spectroscopy. For comparison,
we kept the substrate/enzyme ratio constant at all pH values and chose
a 330-fold excess of chlorite, since this guaranteed full degradation
of the oxidant over the whole range of pH. We observed a significantly
prolonged phase of chlorite decomposition with increasing pH (time
traces at 280 nm, Figure 4b). At pH 5.0, 500 μM chlorite are degraded within 160
ms by 1.5 μM CCld (Figure 4b, top). Within ∼40 ms, the spectrum shifts
to a (not entirely developed) Compound II-like state (Figure 4a,b, top). At the very beginning
of the reaction (∼4 ms after mixing), ∼25% hypochromicity
and a shift of CT1 to 650 nm is observed, which might suggest Compound
I formation to some extent. Higher substrate concentrations lead to
immediate and full formation of Compound II (Soret maximum at 418
nm, typical double peak at 528 and 551 nm, Figure S5a). During chlorite degradation, this redox intermediate
dominates and its spectrum is steadily converted to the ferric resting
state. Interestingly, concomitant with chlorite degradation, an increase
in absorbance at 360 nm is observed (Figure S5b,c). At this wavelength, chlorine dioxide exhibits its characteristic
absorption maximum.26 From previous studies
on horseradish peroxidase,24 it is known
that this enzyme performs the classical peroxidase cycle upon reaction
with chlorite, including Compound I and HOCl/–OCl
formation. Concomitantly, chlorite is used as one-electron donor for
Compound I and Compound II which leads to generation of chlorine dioxide,
the latter being monitored UV–vis spectroscopically and being
responsible for heme destruction when present in excess. However,
in the case of CCld, after consumption of all the chlorite (0.160
s), the absorbance at 360 nm decreases. The latter event is accompanied
by a retransition to a Compound II-like spectrum which then very slowly
shifts back to the ferric resting state.

with chlorite followed by UV–vis
stopped-flow spectroscopy (top to bottom: pH 5.0, 7.0, 9.0). (a) Spectral
changes of 1.5 μM CCld upon reaction with 500 μM chlorite.
Spectrum of ferric CCld is shown in red, the dominating Compound II-like
intermediate spectrum is depicted in blue. Peak maxima are labeled.
For better visualization of the CT and Q bands, the 460–700
nm region is magnified 6-fold. Arrows indicate the course of the reaction
by both, their colors and directions. Spectra and corresponding recording
time points are shown in corresponding colors. (b) Corresponding time
traces at: 405 nm (pH 5.0 and 7.0) and 410 nm (pH 9.0), ferric Soret
maximum, red; 418 nm, Soret maximum of the dominating Compound II-like
intermediate species, blue; 280 nm, chlorite decomposition, black.
To emphasize the pH-dependent differences between the rates of chlorite
degradation (time trace at 280 nm), appropriate time frames are displayed
in the left part of panel (b), and the respective time points of completed
chlorite decomposition are labeled and marked by the continuous dashed
line.

At pH 7.0, the degradation of
500 μM chlorite by 1.5 μM
CCld takes 3.5 s (Figure 4a,b, middle). The spectral course of the reaction exhibits
a direct and rapid transition of the resting state to fully developed
Compound II (decrease in absorbance at 406 nm occurs simultaneously
with red-shift of Soret maximum).

In contrast to pH 5.0, at
pH 7.0 there is no indication of Compound
I formation and the spectral features of Compound II remain fully
established during chlorite degradation. A very slow conversion to
the ferric state starts as soon as all chlorite is consumed (isosbestic
point at 413 nm). The reaction at pH 9.0 is qualitatively invariant
compared to pH 7.0, except that chlorite consumption proceeds over
a longer time period (36 s) and no direct transition from Compound
II to the resting state could be observed even after degradation of
chlorite (Figure 4a,b,
bottom). It is important to note that determination of apparent second-order
rate constants for Compound II formation did not give reliable data.
It was hampered by the fact that kobs values
do not show any linear dependence on substrate concentrations below
∼66-fold excess.

2.4 Spectral Properties of
Ligand-Bound Ferric
and Ferrous CCld
The ligand binding behavior of pentameric
Clds has been probed extensively,14,27,28 and it has been shown that the use of different buffer
compositions can produce a pronounced heterogeneity of high- and low-spin
species.14,27 Interestingly, binding of LS ligands like
cyanide does not necessarily render the enzyme inactive or alter the
kinetic parameters of chlorite degradation.29 This is also the case for ferric CCld, which we probed for binding
to the exogenous HS-ligand fluoride and the LS-ligand thiocyanate.
The dissociation constants for both ligands were determined by titration,
followed by UV–vis spectroscopy, to be 12.6 mM for fluoride
and 0.074 mM for thiocyanate (Figure S6).

Thiocyanate acts as a LS-ligand to the cofactor and binds
in the form of isothiocyanate with its nitrogen atom oriented to the
heme iron (q.v. Section 2.7). Accordingly, the presence of a low-spin heme is confirmed
by a red-shifted Soret maximum at 414 nm and the intensity increase
of Q-bands around 532 and 570 nm in the UV–vis spectrum (Figure S6a, dotted line). Fluoride acts as HS-ligand;
accordingly in the UV–vis spectrum, the Soret maximum is blue-shifted
to 404 nm, and strong bands at 503 and 611 nm are observed (Figure S6a, dashed line).

These features,
and the high-frequency RR spectra obtained with
441.6 nm excitation (ν3 at 1479 cm–1, ν2 at 1561 cm–1, ν10 at 1608 cm–1, data not shown), are characteristic
of a 6cHS form, with fluoride coordinated as the sixth ligand of the
iron ion. In the low-frequency RR spectra, the ν(Fe–F)
stretching mode was assigned on the basis of its intensity enhancement
upon excitation near the CT2 band,30,31 as shown by
the comparison of the RR spectra obtained with excitation at 413.1
and 441.6 nm (Figure S7a,b). The ν(Fe–F)
stretch is assigned to the band at 381 cm–1, which
overlaps with the propionyl bending mode at 374 cm–1. The frequency is lower than the corresponding band of KpCld–F,
and DaCld–F, complexes (385, 390 cm–1, respectively).28 This result agrees very well with the trans-effect
of the proximal ligand on the Fe–F bond strength recently proposed
for Clds. The higher the ν(Fe-Im) frequency, the weaker the
ν(Fe–F) bond.28 CCld has the
largest trans-effect among the different Clds.

To further probe
the ligand binding properties of CCld, carbon
monoxide binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was studied. Complex
formation gives rise to a 6cLS species (Figure S1a,b, spectra (ii)). The ν3 band at 1470
cm–1 in the RR spectrum indicates the presence of
a small amount of 5cHS ferrous heme due to photolysis of the CO ligand
under laser irradiation. Unlike DaCld,14 the spectrum of the carbon monoxide complex is invariant in the
pH interval 5.8–9.8 (data not shown). Figure S8 depicts the RR spectra of the 12CO and 13CO complexes of CCld in the low- and high-frequency regions. Figure 2c shows the two isotope
sensitive bands at 492 and 576 cm–1 in 12CO (which shift to 489 and 559 cm–1 for the CCld-13CO form, Figure S8a), assigned
to the ν(Fe–C) stretching and δ(Fe–C–O)
bending modes, respectively. Accordingly, a corresponding ν(CO)
stretching mode is observed at 1952 cm–1, which
shifts to 1908 cm–1 for the 13C-labeled
form (Figure S8b). The ν(Fe–C)/ν(CO)
frequencies, similar to those previously found for DaCld,14 are typical of heme-CO adducts that have weak
interaction with the distal protein matrix.

Finally, we probed
the pH dependence of the kinetics of cyanide
binding to CCld. Cyanide acts as a strong LS-ligand for many heme
enzymes. For CCld, the spectral properties of the complex are qualitatively
pH-invariant and show a Soret maximum at 421 nm, broad Q-bands with
a maximum at 538 nm, and a shoulder around 565 nm.20

In this work, binding rates have been determined
by single exponential
fitting of the decrease in absorbance at 405 nm (pH 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0)
or double exponential fitting of the increase in absorbance at 410
or 423 nm (pH 8.0, 9.0 and 9.6) (Figure S9). At higher pH values, cyanide complexation is no longer the only
reaction taking place since formation of the hydroxo-complex implies
that OH– has to dissociate from the distal heme
coordination site prior to CN– binding. Association
constants increase with pH and range from 6.32 × 103 M–1 s–1 at pH 5.0 to 1.26 ×
106 M–1 s–1 at pH 9.0
(Figure 5). Around
pH 9.0, the rate reaches a maximum and starts to decrease as the pH
is raised further.

2.5 Impact of pH on the Standard
Reduction Potential
of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) Couple
Finally, we tested whether the
pronounced pH dependence of the activity of CCld is related to pH-dependent
changes in redox properties. In order to determine the standard reduction
potential (E°′) of the Fe(III)/Fe(II)
couple of CCld, spectroelectrochemical studies were performed. Figure 6 shows the fully
oxidized and fully reduced (black lines, AλoxMax = 406 nm and AλredMax = 434 nm) as well as the equilibrium spectra of CCld
(gray lines) at six different applied potentials in the optically
transparent thin-layer spectroelectrochemical (OTTLE) cell (25 °C,
pH 6.0). Two clear isosbestic points at 420 and 455 nm can be observed.
From these data, we obtained a linear Nernst plot with a slope that
is consistent with a one-electron reduction process (Figure 6b).32−34E°′ was calculated to be −94.4 ± 0.3 mV.

Almost identical spectral
transitions were observed at pH 5.0 and
7.0 and from the corresponding Nernst plots E°′
values were calculated to be −82.5 ± 0.9 mV and −126.3
± 1.9 mV, respectively (Figure S10a–d). Between pH 5.0 and 7.0, the reduction potential decreases by −18.5
mV/pH. At pH 10.0, the establishment of a redox equilibrium between
the Fe(III)–hydroxo-complex (AλoxMax = 414 nm) and ferrous CCld (AλredMax = 434 nm) was observed with an isosbestic
point at 421 nm. From the linear Nernst plot, a standard reduction
potential of −172.7 ± 1.5 mV was obtained (Figure S10e,f).

2.6 X-ray
Crystal Structure of CCld at pH 6.5
and 8.5
Homodimeric CCld crystallizes in space group P1 or P1211 and the asymmetric
unit contains one or two dimers, depending on the crystallization
conditions (Table 1). Each subunit binds one heme b and consists of
a β-barrel that is made up of a three-stranded and a five-stranded
antiparallel β-sheet. Eight α-helices complete the previously
described ferredoxin-like fold (Figure 7a) which represents the most prominent common feature
of all heme binding (i.e., functional chlorite dismutase, DyP-type
peroxidase, aldoxime dehydratase, IsdG, and coproheme decarboxylase)
and nonheme-dependent superfamily members. Interactions between the
enzyme subunits include a salt bridge (Arg64-Glu103), hydrogen bonds
(Gln3-Asp134, Ile59-Arg104, Ala62-Asn101), and π-stacking (Trp97-Phe141-His131-Phe55)
(Figure S11). The enzyme was crystallized
in the presence of the endogenous ligands (i) H2O (i.e.,
at pH 6.5) and (ii) OH– (i.e., pH 8.5), and the
exogenous ligands (iii) thiocyanate (i.e., LS-ligand) and (iv) fluoride
(i.e., HS-ligand). Crystals diffracted to high resolution [(i.e.,
1.28 Å for SCN–, 1.18 Å for F– bound CCld, 1.55 Å for OH– bound CCld (pH
8.5) and 1.30 Å for H2O bound CCld (pH 6.5)] (Table 1). All of them are
structurally very similar to a maximum rmsd value of 0.39 Å over
340 Cα atoms. Furthermore, the similarity to the only other
solved dimeric chlorite dismutase structure of Nitrobacter
winogradskyi is high with an rmsd of 0.81 Å over
337 equiv Cα atoms. For both, NwCld and CCld, a very flexible
loop, encompassing the residues 40 to 49, could only be modeled in
the OH– bound CCld structure (Figure S12c, the respective loops in both subunits are colored
in red) due to special crystal packing which was the result of altered
crystallization conditions (Figure S12a,b, pH 8.5 and 6.5, respectively).

Figure 7 Structure of
CCld crystallized at pH 6.5 (i.e., highly active state).
(a) The dimeric structure is shown as cartoon. Heme groups are depicted
as gray sticks, the heme iron is shown as an orange sphere. (b) Left:
Detailed view of the active site surrounding amino acid residues.
Distal residues include Q74 and R127, proximal residues include H114,
E167, K92, Y61, R104, and R105, the latter three as well as the former
three generating two hydrogen bonding networks via the heme propionates.
Waters (W) and heme iron are depicted as red and orange spheres, respectively.
The heme is shown as gray sticks. Dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonding
distances which are listed in Table 2. Right: Active site view rotated by 60° for better
visualization of the separation of the proximal hydrogen bonding networks.
(c) Left: Illustration of a computed intramolecular tunnel (shown
in orange) that is filled with water molecules (shown as red spheres)
and generates an active-site connection. The side chains of H131 of
both subunits are pointing toward this tunnel. Right: Zoom on H131
which is hydrogen bonded to waters W503, W504, and W505, thereby interconnecting
the two heme propionate groups.

Figure 7b
shows
the active site architecture of CCld at pH 6.5 (i.e., highly active
state). His114 serves as the proximal fifth heme ligand, and its Nε2 is at a distance of 2.09 Å from the iron atom.
The distal sixth heme ligand H2O binds to the heme iron
at a distance of 2.60 Å. This distance is longer than expected
for a water molecule bound to the heme iron. As previously observed
for the ARP/CIP-SHA complex,35 the combined
analysis of the spectroscopic data and X-ray crystal structures of
CCld at pH 6.5 indicates that the Fe–H2O distance
as measured by X-ray diffraction is an average resulting from the
5c and 6c species in equilibrium that, however, are directly revealed
by RR spectroscopy. Very importantly, it has to be noted, that the
extent of photoreduction in the crystal is strongly dependent on the
applied radiation dose,36 and it has been
shown that the redox sensitive metal centers get significantly reduced
at already 10% of applied dose needed to collect the entire diffraction
data set. Thus, the heme iron is very likely fully reduced, which
is most probably at the basis of the unexpected increased distance
to the distal ligand since water does not usually bind to the ferrous
heme iron. The distal ligand is in hydrogen bonding distance (i.e.,
2.87 Å) to a conserved H2O molecule (W502) found in
every CCld X-ray data set, notably also in the neutron and X-ray data
sets collected at room temperature (q.v. Section 2.8). W502 is in turn H-bonded (2.91 Å)
to the Nε of Arg127 residue, which is strictly conserved
among functional Clds.11,12 Interestingly, in all obtained
CCld data sets, the Arg127 side chain is positioned away from the
heme moiety. This out-conformation is putatively stabilized by hydrogen
bonding between Nη1 of Arg127 and Oε1 of Gln74 (2.85 Å) (Figure 7b). For CCld, two separate hydrogen bonding networks
on the proximal side of the heme can be identified. All involved residues
(i.e., His114, Glu167, Lys92 and Tyr61, Arg104, Arg105) are conserved
among functional chlorite dismutases with the exception of Arg105
which is characteristic for clade 2 representatives. As previously
described, His114, Glu167, and Lys92 form an H-bonding network from
the heme iron to the heme substituent propionate 6 (Figure 7b).12 A second network is generated by Tyr61, Arg104, and Arg105, which
are interconnected via hydrogen bonds between their side chains. Tyr61
generates an additional hydrogen bond to propionate at position 7
via its backbone nitrogen (Figure 7b).

Further, two active site access channels
per subunit can be identified.
Since the subunits are rotated 180° with respect to each other,
just one connection from the surface to the active site per subunit
remains, whereas the other one disappears in the protein interface
(Figure 7c). Using
CAVER,37 it becomes evident that the latter
channel interconnects both active sites (Figure 7c, left). CAVER reports an average bottleneck
radius for the tunnel of 1.43 Å. The channel is approximately
25 Å in length (from propionate to propionate) and potentially
enables a facilitated chemical cross-talk between CCld subunits.

Figure S12d shows the active site structure
of CCld at pH 8.5 (i.e., moderately active state). Nε2 of His114 is at a distance of 2.30 Å from the coordinated
iron atom of the heme group whereas the oxygen of OH– is at a distance of 2.51 Å. The aforementioned H2O (W502) is at 2.80 Å from Nε of Arg127. Nη1 of Arg127 is in hydrogen bonding distance (i.e., 2.84
Å) to Oε1 of Gln74.

2.7 X-ray
Crystal Structures of Fluoride and Isothiocyanate
Complexes of CCld
Figure S13a shows
the active site of CCld with the heme bound to fluoride. The protein
was crystallized at pH 6.5, and the electron density map was contoured
at σ = 1.6. The distance of proximal histidine Nε2 to the iron atom is 2.07 Å, and the high-spin ligand fluoride
is at a distance of 2.42 Å from the iron atom. W502 is at a distance
of 2.91 Å from the ligand and at a distance of 2.95 Å from
Nε of Arg127, whose Nη1 is 2.87
Å away from Oε1 of Gln74 (Table 2). Also in this case, the unexpected increased distance between
the iron atom and the fluoride is most probably a consequence of the
photoreduction since fluoride binds only ferric hemes.30

Figure S13b shows the active site of
CCld in complex with SCN– which was crystallized
at pH 6.5. The distance of Nε2 of His114 to the iron
atom is 2.11 Å. The LS-ligand SCN– binds with
its nitrogen atom facing the heme iron at a distance of 2.04 Å.
W502 is at 3.16 Å from the ligand nitrogen atom and 2.77 Å
distant from Nε of Arg127. Once again, hydrogen bonding
can be observed between Nη1 of Arg127 and Oε1 of Gln74 at a distance of 2.85 Å. To confirm the depicted
orientation of the ligand, a data set was collected at a wavelength
of 1.9 Å (Figure S13c) at which the
anomalous scattering of nitrogen and carbon is negligible and the
strong difference anomalous electron density peak corresponds to the
sulfur atom, corroborating the orientation of the ligand. The data
enable us to conclude that the sulfur does not directly interact with
the iron atom.

2.8 Neutron and X-ray Crystal
Structure of CCld
at pH 9.0 and Room Temperature
Two of the most substantial
limiting factors of using X-rays for protein structure determination
are that (i) positions of hydrogens and protons, which contribute
up to 50% or more to the total number of atoms in a protein, often
cannot be determined from X-ray scattering data and (ii) photoreduction
occurs, which is especially an issue for metal containing enzyme cofactors
like heme.38 Neutrons are able to overcome
both issues since neutrons (i) are scattered by hydrogen atoms to
the same extent as as carbons, nitrogen or oxygen atoms and they (ii)
are nonionizing. Consequently, photoreduction does not occur at all.39 Here, we used neutron crystallography as a complementary
technique to X-ray diffraction studies to obtain comprehensive structural
information on CCld in its active ferric state, including protonation
states of important amino acid residues. In particular, the protonation
state of this Arg is the subject of ongoing debate as it is believed
that an untypically low pKa value (i.e.,
around 6.5 for DaCld) of the amino acid side chain dictates activity
profiles and inactivation behavior of Clds.10,11,14

Crystal growth of hydrogenated CCld
in quartz capillaries was facilitated by applying the method of microseeding.
Crystals formed within 5–10 days. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange
and change of pH from 6.5 to pD 9.4 was achieved by repeated crystallization
buffer exchange. The dimensions of the investigated diamond shaped
crystal were approximately 2.0 × 1.0 × 0.4 mm. The ratio
of crystal volume to asymmetric unit volume was calculated to be 60,
a value underlining the challenging character of the experiment.40 The characterization of the heme ligand and
determination of the protonation states of amino acid residues (i.e.,
Lys92, Arg104, Arg105, His114, Arg127, His131, Glu167) were expected
to assist a rationalization of the inactivity of the enzyme at this
pH. This experiment yielded the 54th protein structure solved by neutron
crystallography (Protein Data Bank, May 2017) and the first oxidized
chlorite dismutase structure collected at room temperature. Using
neutrons, the crystal diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.35 Å,
whereas with X-rays it diffracted to 2.0 Å. The CCld model was
refined against X-ray data alone, followed by joint X-ray and neutron
refinement.

Figure 8a shows
that Nδ1 of His114 is protonated and in hydrogen
bonding distance (i.e., 2.75 Å) to Oε1 of Glu167.
The deprotonated Nε2 of His114 is at 2.12 Å
from the heme iron and serves as proximal ligand. Comparing the His114
Nε2 to iron distances of all structures in complex
with endogenous ligands H2O or OH–, it
can be summarized that they increase in the order X-ray crystallography
(H2O, 100 K, synchrotron) < Neutron crystallography
(OH–) < X-ray crystallography (OH–, 100 K, synchrotron) < X-ray crystallography (OH–, room temperature, in-house source) (Table 2).

The distal heme ligand OD– is depicted as sticks,
the heme iron is shown as an orange sphere. Nitrogen: blue, oxygen:
red, deuterium: turquoise.

Further, Oε2 of Glu167 is hydrogen bonded
to Nζ of Lys92 which in turn makes hydrogen bonding
contacts
with the heme propionate at position 6. At the backbone nitrogen of
Tyr61, there is no nuclear density observable indicating that the
hydrogen is either not easily accessible or that it is involved in
a hydrogen bond with the heme propionate at position 7 (Figure 8b). Both situations could hinder
its exchange for deuterium. The hydroxyl group of Tyr61 is in hydrogen
bonding distance to the guanidinium group of Arg104; however, nuclear
density clearly reveals an involvement of Tyr61 in a hydrogen bond
to W506, which is coordinated by O1D of propionate 6 (Figure 8b). Protonated Nη1 of Arg105 is 2.99 Å away from the backbone oxygen of Tyr61.

Most importantly, at pD 9.4 Arg127 is fully protonated and Nε of this residue is at a distance of 2.59 Å from
W502, engaged in a hydrogen bond. Supported by spectroscopic measurements,
the nature of the distal heme ligand was characterized to be an OH– at the studied pH, with an average distance of the
oxygen to the iron atom of 2.33 Å, longer than expected, therefore,
either due to the coexistence of both 6cHS and LS hydroxo-complexes
observed at room temperature or to the photoreduction since also OH– is not a specific ligand of ferrous heme. Comparing
all CCld structures in complex with OH–, the ligand-to-iron
distance increases in the order neutron crystallography < X-ray
crystallography (in-house source) < X-ray crystallography (synchrotron),
reflecting the correlation between ligand distance and the reducing
power of the applied radiation.

His131 is another critical amino
acid residue as it is strictly
conserved among functional chlorite dismutases, and its side chain
is found at an important position toward the intramolecular channel
described above (Figure 7c, left). Three water molecules (W503, W504, W505) form a hydrogen
bonding network that spans the His131 side chain and both heme propionates
(Figure 7c, right).
All three waters can be clearly identified in all obtained density
maps (neutron and X-ray). Notably, the signals for the room temperature
measurement with neutrons are distinct, with B-factors comparable
to protein atoms, suggesting that these water molecules are tightly
bound. This in turn emphasizes their important functional role in
properly positioning the heme propionate groups.

3 Discussion
Chlorite dismutase from Cyanothece sp. PCC7425
is a dimeric representative of clade 2 functional Clds and represents
the first protein of this clade which has been comprehensively characterized
regarding structure–function relationships. Similar to its
characterized homologues (e.g., NdCld, DaCld, Cld from GR-1, KpCld),
it is capable of efficiently converting chlorite into chloride and
molecular oxygen, the reaction being strongly dictated by pH. The
(increasingly incomplete) substrate turnover is significantly slowed
down with rising pH. In this work, we have focused on the elucidation
of the impact of pH on structure and the molecular mechanism of chlorite
degradation by CCld.

3.1 Impact of pH on the Active
Site Architecture
of CCld
Spectroelectrochemical studies revealed that the
reduction potential E°′ of the [Fe(III)/Fe(II]
couple of CCld at pH 5.0 is −82.5 mV, which is significantly
higher compared to plant type heme b peroxidases
like horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (∼ −260 mV). This
reflects the more hydrophilic distal heme pocket of HRP that stabilizes
the ferric state. In CCld, E°′ undergoes
a decrease of −90 mV between pH 5.0 (−82.5 mV) and pH
10.0 (−172.7 mV). A main contribution to this modulation results
from the deprotonation of the distal heme ligand H2O with
increasing pH giving rise to a predominant hydroxo-LS ligand [ν(Fe–OH)
stretching mode at 510 cm–1], which selectively
stabilizes Fe(III)–heme over Fe(II)-heme for electrostatic
as well as coordinative reasons.41 In the
case of CCld, the pKa of this alkaline
transition was found to be 8.1, a value slightly lower than those
reported for pentameric chlorite dismutases (DaCld: 8.7;14 IdCld: 8.5;15 chlorite
dismutase from the chlorate respiring strain GR-1:8.242).

The redox properties of a heme protein are determined
by (i) the proximal heme ligand and its noncovalent interactions with
other active site residues, (ii) the conformations and interactions
of the heme propionates, and (iii) the nature of distal (catalytic)
residues and their interactions with both the protein matrix and the
solvent. In Clds, a His serves as proximal heme ligand. Studying ferrous
CCld, resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed a high ν(Fe-Im)
frequency (231 cm–1) that is in agreement with the
distance (2.09 ± 0.03 Å) between the heme iron and the His114
Nε2 found in the X-ray structure obtained at pH 6.5.
It shows that the proximal His114 is H-bonded to the nearby Glu167
residue and thereby obtains a significant imidazolate character, similar
to that observed in heme peroxidases.43 However, unlike the heme containing peroxidases, the ν(Fe-Im)
frequency does not vary at basic pH. In fact, for peroxidases at alkaline
pH, a downshift of the ν(Fe–His) frequency is observed
due to a weakening of the H-bond interaction.44

The neutron structure of CCld nicely demonstrates the Cld-typical
conserved and rigid proximal H-bonding network (Figure 8). It shows that the deprotonated Nε2 of His114 coordinates the ferric heme iron whereas Nδ1 of His114 is protonated and hydrogen bonded to Oε1 of Glu167. Further, Oε2 of Glu167 is H-bonded
to Nζ of Lys92, which in turn makes hydrogen bonding
contacts with the heme propionate at position 6. Except for the distance
between the heme iron and Nε2 of His114, the lengths
of these conserved hydrogen bonds are only very slightly modulated
by pH and the presence of distal ligands (Table 2).

Participation of heme propionates
in this network is also underlined
by the intense propionate bending band at 370 cm–1 (361 cm–1 for the ferrous form), suggesting a
moderate hydrogen bond interaction between the propionate substituents
and nearby residues.45 Besides interaction
of propionate 6 with Lys92, the neutron structure additionally shows
that Tyr61, which is connected to propionate 7 via its backbone nitrogen,
makes strong H-bonding contacts to propionate 6 via a conserved water
molecule (W506). Moreover, the electronic state of the heme cofactor
is further influenced by the hydrogen bonding network built by His131
and three conserved waters (W503, W504, and W505), spanning from one
propionate to the other (Figure 7c).

These H-bonding interactions stabilize CCld
in the ferric state
at all pH values studied, although this stabilizing effect is more
pronounced at alkaline pH (see above). Around the (acidic) pH optimum,
the resting ferric heme iron participates in a distal H-bonding network
that includes the metal ion, W501, W502, conserved Arg127 in “out”
conformation and Gln74 (Figure 7b). Distance analyses based on both the X-ray structure at
pH 8.5 and the neutron structure at pH 9.0, indicate that deprotonation
of W501 at alkaline pH shortens the distance to the heme iron in agreement
with the formation of the Fe–OH ligation (highlighted by RR
at room temperature). Deprotonation of W501 also significantly weakens
or even breaks the interaction between OH– and W502
and simultaneously strengthens the interaction between W502 and Arg127
(Table 2). The interaction
between Arg127 and Gln74 is not affected by the alkaline transition.

One of the main questions of the present study was the role of
conserved Arg127 in catalysis and whether its protonation status modulates
the rate and extent of chlorite degradation. In this work, we could
obtain neutron and X-ray diffraction data from the same H/D exchanged
crystal at pH 9.0. Therefore, both data sets could be simultaneously
refined (joint neutron/X-ray refinement), which can compensate for
the increased number of parameters that must be refined in the neutron
structure. This is due to the addition of hydrogens atoms into the
structure essentially doubling the number of atoms that are present
in refinement compared to a typical X-ray structure.

For H/D
exchanged samples, phenix.refine automatically determines
such sites and performs constrained occupancy refinement, constraining
the sum of occupancies of H and D to one. For Arg127, phenix.refine
calculates occupancies of exchangeable H/D in the side chain for chain
A of 1 and for chain B of 0.97. Control refinements setting the Dη22 and Hη22 simultaneously to zero,
thereby mimicking a deprotonated state, did not result in a positive
density peak at this position. These data clearly suggest that Arg127
is protonated at pH 9.0 and rule out that it may serve as distal base
and dictate the activity profile of CCld. This is also underlined
by recently conducted studies about the pKa value of Arg which conclude that the guanidinium moiety is virtually
always charged in a protein, even in hydrophobic core regions and
pockets.46,47

3.2 Impact of Ligand Binding
on the Structure
of the Heme Cavity
Elucidation of the crystal structures
of HS and LS complexes studied at pH 6.5 demonstrate that the addition
of a ligand, irrespective of its nature, eliminates W501 but not W502
from the heme cavity and keeps Arg127 in the “out” conformation
(Figure S13). The binding of the HS ligand
fluoride does not induce obvious rearrangements of the distal H-bonding
network (Figure S13a, Table 2). By contrast, binding of the
LS ligand isothiocyanate (Figure S13b)
results in (i) a significantly reduced distance between the nitrogen
atom of the ligand and the heme iron with respect to the water or
hydroxo-ligands, and in (ii) weakening of the H-bond between the nitrogen
atom and W502 which in the complex is closer to Arg127 (Table 2). For DFT calculations, the
isothiocyanate complex [Por···Fe(III)––NCS] structure of pentameric AoCld (PDB: 2VXH) was used to construct a model of the
enzyme–substrate complex [Por···Fe(III)––OClO] before O–Cl bond cleavage.48 However, any conclusions drawn from these studies
should carefully consider that in the AoCld X-ray crystal structure
the distal Arg is found in the “in” conformation, thereby
displacing a potential bridging water (W502 in CCld) between ligand
and distal Arg.

The interaction between ligands, the solvent
and the distal protein matrix was also probed by RR spectroscopy.
Principally, the absorption maximum of the CT1 band is a sensitive
probe of the interaction of fluoride with distal amino acid residues.
It red-shifts when the ligand acts as an H-bond acceptor, since the
interaction between the p orbitals of the ligand
and the iron dπ orbitals decreases the energy of the latter.30,31 In CCld, the low energy of the CT1 band, together with the low frequency
of the ν(Fe–F–) stretch, indicate the
presence of strong H-bonding interactions supporting the X-ray crystal
structure depicted in Figure S13a. Fluoride
serves as H-bond acceptor for W502, which in turn is H-bonded to Arg127.
This finding is supported by RR spectra of the Fe(II)-CO complex,
which reveal very moderate polar interactions of carbon monoxide with
the distal protein matrix. CO is not able to interact with water and
the Arg127 in the “out” conformation is positioned too
far to enable direct contact.

The hypothesis that Arg127 may
serve as distal base could also
be ruled out by determination of association rate constants of cyanide.
The pKa of HCN is 9.14 and, typically,
the anionic form (CN–) binds to the ferric heme
protein. In heme peroxidases, a basic amino acid, typically histidine,
acts as a proton acceptor forming the anionic ligand that binds to
the ferric state. Thus, formation of the LS complex depends on the
corresponding pKa of the distal histidine.49 In the case of functional Clds, the observed
pH dependence clearly underlines that these enzymes lack a distal
base that supports deprotonation of HCN. Between pH 5.0 and 8.0, the
apparent bimolecular rate constant of cyanide binding to ferric CCld
strictly increased with increasing pH and the ionization of HCN (Figure 5). Accordingly, both
the obtained neutron structure of CCld combined with kinetic information
on cyanide binding clearly refute the hypothesis that Arg127 acts
as a base and dictates the pH dependence of chlorite degradation.

3.3 Molecular Mechanism of Chlorite Degration
It has been demonstrated previously by isotope-labeling experiments
that both oxygen atoms in the evolved O2 derive from chlorite
and that the reaction stoichiometry (chlorite:oxygen) is 1:1.2 Finally, based on experimental studies on pentameric
Clds6,10−17 and theoretical studies,48 two mechanisms
were proposed that both involve a (heterolytic or homolytic) O–Cl
bond cleavage in the [Por···Fe(III)––OClO] complex leading to a ClO fragment (hypochlorous acid or chlorine
monoxide) and a high–valent oxoiron(IV) intermediate (Compound
I or Compound II).

Studying pre-steady-state kinetics of NdCld11,12 and DaCld2,14 was so far hampered by the fact
that (i) the reaction with chlorite proceeds too fast to be tracked
by the stopped-flow technique and that (ii) the spectral transitions
were ambiguous and thus difficult to interpret. By contrast, the spectral
features of dimeric CCld in its various oxidation states are much
more pronounced, thus allowing their interconversions during chlorite
degradation to be followed.

From studies on heme peroxidases
and catalases it is known that
(HOCl/–OCl) functions as a two-electron oxidant
of heme peroxidases thereby rapidly producing Compound I.23,24 At biologically relevant pH, hypochlorous acid is a strong two-electron
oxidant [E°′(HOCl, H+/Cl–, H2O) = 1280 mV at pH 7.0 and 1490 mV at
pH 0.0].50 As a consequence, it mediates
the two-electron oxidation of lactoperoxidase (LPO) or myeloperoxidase
(MPO)51 to the corresponding Compound I
state. This applies also to peracetic acid [E°′(CH3COOOH, H+/CH3COO–,
H2O) = 1636 mV at pH 6.0].10,52 Here, we could
demonstrate that CCld follows the same reaction. Hypochlorite rapidly
oxidizes the ferric enzyme to Compound I which is characterized by
about 50% hypochromicity at the Soret maximum and a distinct band
at 650 nm (Scheme 1, (4)). Compound I slowly shifts to an intermediate with spectral
features similar to Compound II which is better defined as Compound
I* having the porphyryl radical quenched by electrons spent by the
protein matrix (Scheme 1, (5)). This internal (unspecific) electron transfer is increased
with increasing pH which was also seen with Compound I of pentameric
DaCld produced by peracetic acid.13 For
DaCld, freeze-quench EPR confirmed the presence of an uncoupled protein-based
radical formed upon decay of Compound I to Compound I*.13

Scheme 1 Proposed Main (Highlighted in Green) and
Side Reactions (Highlighted
in Blue) of Ferric CCld with Chlorite
Importantly, even in the presence of excess (HOCl/–OCl), neither with CCld nor with DaCld could O2 formation
be measured polarographically. This clearly contradicts an efficient
rebound mechanism between Compound I and hypochlorite as described
by Reaction IV. This
is also underlined by the fact that Compound I formation mediated
by chlorite (which must be accompanied by generation of HOCl) has
never been detected with pentameric chlorite dismutases by using UV–vis
stopped-flow spectroscopy. Moreover, heterolytic cleavage of chlorite
was ruled out by DFT calculations due to the absence of spin localized
at the porphyrin macrocycle and an unfavorable high energy barrier.48

In contrast, mixing of dimeric CCld with
chlorite in the stopped-flow
apparatus leads to the formation of Compound II (Soret maximum at
418 nm, two prominent bands at 528 and 551 nm) within milliseconds
(Scheme 1, (1)). Chlorite
is a weaker two-electron oxidant compared to HOCl/–OCl. Its standard reduction potential for the redox couple (HClO2, 2H+/HOCl, H2O) is reported to be 1080
mV at pH 7.0, and it increases with 88 mV per pH unit with decreasing
pH (being 1256 at pH 5.0 and 1645 mV at pH 0.0).53 Chlorite is well-known to mediate Compound I formation
in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [E°′(Fe(III)/Fe(II))
= −310 mV; E°′ (Compound I/ferric
HRP) = 920 mV at pH 7.0].24,54 Under acidic conditions,
oxidation of HRP by chlorite becomes more favorable because of the
divergent pH dependencies of both redox couples. The potential of
the couple (Compound I/ferric HRP) increases with 59 mV per decreasing
pH unit.54 In contrast to HRP, chlorite
is unable to mediate Compound I formation of MPO [E°′(Fe(III)/Fe(II)) = +5 mV; E°′
(Compound I/ferric MPO) = 1160 mV at pH 7.0]55,56 or bovine LPO [E°′(Fe(III)/Fe(II))
= −183 mV; E°′ (Compound I/ferric
HRP) = 1090 mV at pH 7.0].57,58 Although we do not
know E°′ (Compound I/ferric) of CCld,
it is reasonable to assume that the two-electron oxidation of CCld
by chlorite is thermodynamically unfavorable. As already discussed
above, due to the hydrophobic heme cavity, E°′[Fe(III)/Fe(II)]
of CCld is high (in between E°′ of LPO
and MPO), which suggests that also E°′
(Compound I/ferric CCld) exhibits values comparable to LPO and MPO
(>1100 mV). By contrast, the one-electron oxidation of ferric CCld
by chlorite should be thermodynamically feasible since (in analogy
to heme peroxidases) E°′ (Compound II/ferric
CCld) < E°′ (Compound I/ferric CCld)
and Compound II will be more stable in a hydrophobic cavity compared
to Compound I. This is also indicated by computational studies.48

Due to increasing E°′
values of the
redox couple (HClO2, 2H+/HOCl, H2O) with decreasing pH, the two-electron oxidation of ferric CCld
might become feasible in the acidic region (Scheme 1, (6)). Indeed, upon mixing ferric CCld with
chlorite at pH 5.0, we monitored some hypochromicity in the Soret
absorbance within the first milliseconds before Compound II is formed
(Figure 4a). This might
indicate formation of Compound I to a certain extent. Nevertheless,
at pH > 5.0 ferric CCld is converted directly to Compound II.

In the time course of chlorite degradation, Compound II is the
dominating redox intermediate at all pH values. It should be mentioned
that the spectral properties of Compound II are completely different
from those of the LS (cyanide, isothiocyanate, hydroxide) complexes
(421–538 nm, 414–532 nm, 414–540 nm, respectively)
ruling out that the observed dominating intermediate during turnover
represents [Por···Fe(III)–OOCl–], i.e. the reaction product of the rebinding step (Scheme 1, (2)). According to computational
studies, this intermediate can be considered as a transient (short-lived)
LS complex of ferric Cld.48

At all
pH values, Compound II is formed immediately upon mixing
ferric CCld with chlorite, whereas the total time for chlorite degradation
(followed at 280 nm) significantly increases with increasing pH. A
mechanistic explanation of this behavior is yet to be found since
the presented structural data disprove the hypothesis that the distal
Cld-typical Arg dictates the pH dependence. As outlined above, it
is protonated at all studied pH values (even in the presence of anionic
ligands) and its orientation in crystal structures is always “out”.
The dominating “out” conformation is also supported
by RR data that suggest weak interactions of the CO ligand with the
protein matrix. However, we do not want to dispute the hypothesis
that Arg127 is flexible and can adopt the “in” conformation
in solution during enzyme turnover.

Based on these findings
we propose the following reaction mechanism.
The reaction cycle of dimeric CCld is initiated by binding of the
anionic substrate (pKa = 1.72) to the
Fe(III) center which occurs spontaneously and independent of Arg.11 At this step, Arg is in the “out”
conformation and seems to be relevant for chlorite recognition only.9 The resulting enzyme–substrate complex
[Por···Fe(III)––OClO] is either
hydrogen bonded to W502 as suggested by the CCld-isothiocyanate complex
[Por···Fe(III)––NCS] or directly
to Arg127, which in the “in” conformation would displace
W502. As suggested by computational studies, in the “in”
conformation both oxygen atoms of chlorite act as H-bond acceptors
for the Arg. By homolytic cleavage chlorine monoxide and Compound
II are formed (Scheme 1, (1)). Our stopped-flow studies clearly show that Compound II formation
is extremely fast between pH 5.0 and 9.0 suggesting that the rate
of homolytic bond cleavage is independent of pH. This might suggest
that the following rebound step (Scheme 1, (2)) is responsible for the observed pH
dependence. These findings also rule out that there is any mechanistic
difference in the replacement of either W501 (at acidic pH) or its
deprotonated version (at alkaline pH) (pKa = 8.1) that could lead to the observed pH dependence.

With
increasing pH, the O–O bond formation apparently becomes
inefficient and the rate of chlorite degradation decreases significantly.
Rebinding of Compound II and chlorine monoxide needs rotation of the
latter and rearrangements of H-bonds with Arg127 to support O–O
bond formation which–according to computational studies–is
a very fast process.48 Finally, to facilitate
the departure of the chloride anion from the resulting LS complex
[Por···Fe(III)–OOCl–], the
H-bonds between the Arg and the two oxygen atoms are required to rearrange
again to the terminal Cl atom, an event which might provide the stabilization
for the leaving negatively charged chloride anion (Scheme 1, (3)).

Besides the decrease
of the rate of chlorite degradation, Clds
become inactivated at alkaline pH. As a consequence, the degradation
of higher amounts of chlorite is incomplete under these conditions.
This is also the case for CCld.20 Based
on studies on pentameric Clds and a proposed heterolytic cleavage
of chlorite, it was hypothesized that hypochlorite is responsible
for the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme.11 Inefficient rebinding of hypochlorite to Compound I was
proposed to lead to the release of (HOCl/–OCl) which
oxidatively modifies both the heme cofactor and the protein. This
was demonstrated by addition of hypochlorite traps. However, it is
not possible to exclude that other chlorine species (chlorine monoxide
or the observed byproduct chlorine dioxide, see below) also react
with the trapping agents that were applied in the cited study. It
is reasonable to assume that under suboptimal conditions for the rebound
reaction the postulated intermediate chlorine monoxide escapes from
the reaction sphere and promotes enzyme inactivation.

The present
study also shows that chlorine dioxide is a byproduct
of chlorite degradation. Typically, it derives from the one-electron
oxidation of chlorite by redox intermediates like Compound I and Compound
II of heme peroxidases.24 The standard
reduction potential of the couple (ClO2/ClO2–) has a value of 934 mV and is independent of
pH above pH 2.0.59 Both Compound I and
II of CCld could be able to mediate the oxidation of chlorite to chlorine
dioxide. As mentioned above, at acidic pH, some Compound I formation
might occur as a side reaction. Its reduction to Compound II would
generate chlorine dioxide (Scheme 1, (7)). Moreover, at excess of chlorite and/or under
nonoptimal conditions for the rebound reaction, chlorite can compete
with chlorine monoxide and act as electron donor for Compound II.
Thereby, chlorine monoxide is eliminated from the reaction sphere
and chlorine dioxide is produced (Scheme 1, (8)). These reactions and the release of
the generated chlorine species might contribute to the pH dependence
and enzyme inactivation at increasing pH values.

However, further
investigations are definitely necessary to elucidate
the exact mechanism of the pH dependence of chlorite degradation.
The present study unequivocally demonstrates that CCld is an excellent
model enzyme to study these reactions. It is possible to grow high-quality
crystals at various pH to obtain high-resolution X-ray and neutron
structures. Most importantly, it allows assignment of all relevant
redox intermediates according to their spectral features and study
of the kinetics of their interconversion by multimixing stopped-flow
spectroscopy.
