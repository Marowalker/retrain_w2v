Mechanistic investigations of a Rh(I)-catalyzed direct C–H
alkylation of benzylic amines with alkenes, formally an C(sp3)–H activation, reveal this reaction to proceed via imine
intermediates and, hence, via C(sp2)–H activation.
The reaction shows a primary kinetic isotope effect of 4.3 at the
benzylic C–H position together with a reversible H–D
exchange at the same position, which indicates that there are at least
two distinct steps in which the corresponding C–H bonds are
broken. The imine intermediates are shown to be converted to the final
product under the reaction conditions, and a time course analysis
of the alkylated imine intermediate shows that it is formed before
the final amine product in the course of the reaction.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, the development of catalytic C–H activation
methods to selectively functionalize organic molecules at unsubstituted
carbon atoms has emerged tremendously.1 Especially, C–H activation of sp2-hybridized C–H
bonds is now quite common and well established in the field.2 On the other hand, C–H activation of sp3-hybridized C–H bonds still remains difficult and is
therefore of special interest.3 To gain
a better understanding of these reactions and overcome the difficulties,
detailed mechanistic investigations are important. They provide insight
into the intrinsic problems and indicate in which step of the catalytic
cycle optimization is necessary. A very useful and general method
to achieve catalytic C–H activation is cyclometalation, which
employs the aid of a nearby coordinating group to direct the catalyst
selectively to one specific C–H bond to be activated and functionalized.4 Our group recently reported several useful methods
for the C–H activation of benzylic sp3 C–H
bonds directed by 3-substituted pyridin-2-yls, including Ru(0)-catalyzed
arylation employing arylboronates5 and
Ru(II)-catalyzed arylation of benzylic amines with aryl halides.6 Herein, we report detailed mechanistic investigations
into a Rh(I)-catalyzed method to alkylate benzylic amines using either
alkyl bromides or alkenes. It should be noted that the alkylation
of 1 using alkenes catalyzed by Ru(0) was already reported
by the group of Jun in 1998;7 however,
to the best of our knowledge, there have not yet been any published
reports using Rh(I) catalysis or contributions dedicated to detailed
mechanistic investigations of such a transformation.

The initial
idea behind this research was to use alkyl halides
in direct alkylation reactions of benzylamines carrying a directing
group on the amine function. We had developed several direct arylation
protocols and gained significant experience and mechanistic understanding
with this type of substrate. Therefore, we were confident that we
could use the same system for direct alkylation using alkyl halides,
a coupling between two sp3-hybridized carbon atoms.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Screening of Direct C–H
Alkylation
Reactions
We started the development of direct alkylation
of 1 using the conditions optimized for our direct arylation
reactions but employing alkyl bromides as the alkyl source (Table 1: entry 1, conditions derived from the aryl chloride
protocol; entry 2, conditions derived from the aryl bromide protocol).6 Initial experiments using 1-bromoheptane as the
alkyl source showed promising conversion of substrate 1 of ∼20% to the alkylated product 2 (Table 1, entries 1 and 2), but significant amounts of unreacted 1 (∼40%) remained. After intensively screening reaction
conditions employing the [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 catalyst without any significant improvements (not shown),8 it turned out that [RhCl(cod)]2 gave
better conversion (Table 1, entry 3). Further
optimizing the reaction conditions showed that the addition of ligands
had no beneficial influence, and cyclohexanol proved to be unnecessary
(Table 1, entries 5 and 6).9 The best results were obtained when raising the temperature
to 160 °C and changing the solvent to toluene (Table 1, entry 6).

After our optimization efforts, we started investigating
the substrate
scope with respect to alkyl bromides. We were especially interested
in using secondary alkyl bromides because they should lead to branched
products. However, when conducting the reaction with 2-bromobutane,
we found that alkylation had taken place at the terminal carbon, and
the same product was obtained as in the reaction with 1-bromobutane
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Direct Alkylation of Benzylic Amine 1 Using Either 1-Bromobutane
or 2-Bromobutane
Because β-H-elimination is very common in alkyl
complexes
of transition metals, we suspected the reaction proceeds via the corresponding
terminal alkene.10 Hence, it was tested
whether alkenes would react under these conditions to form the corresponding
alkylated products. The first experiments using hex-1-ene gave the
corresponding alkylated product 4 in 44% isolated yield.
In addition, in experiments using either 1-bromododecane or 1-bromo-2-phenylethane,
the corresponding alkenes could be detected in low amounts by means
of GC/MS in the reaction mixture. In the absence of [RhCl(cod)]2, no alkene formation was observed, confirming a crucial role
of the catalyst and excluding simple thermal elimination.

Because
the conditions applied in the first experiments with alkenes
stemmed from optimizing the alkyl bromide protocol, further screening
experiments were carried out. Initial experiments showed that the
alkylation reaction using alkenes proceeded considerably faster; therefore,
the temperature could be reduced to 150 °C. In addition, using
degassed toluene accelerated the reaction significantly. The optimized
reaction conditions are shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Optimized Reaction Conditions for Direct C–H Alkylation of
Benzylic Amine 1 Using Alkenes
Yields are calibrated GC yields.

There are
several features to be noted here. First, as can be seen
in Scheme 2, we observed significant formation
of two byproducts, 5 and 6. At first sight,
they seem rather surprising; however, their formation can be explained
by C–C activations.11 We conducted
several experiments, discussed later (vide infra), to investigate
their formation. Second, small amounts (below 1%) of the corresponding
imines of 1 and 4 were detected in the reaction
mixture throughout the whole reaction time. Third, K2CO3 proved to be absolutely crucial in this reaction because
experiments without K2CO3 did not show any conversion
to the corresponding alkylated product. In the reaction employing
alkyl bromides, K2CO3 is conceptually needed
to catch the HBr formed and, therefore, to drive the reaction to the
products. In the case of alkenes, however, there is no formation of
an acidic byproduct because the reaction toward 1 is
formally an addition of a C–H bond across a double bond. Finally,
only 79% of the initial amount of 1 is found in the products.
Because we were not able to detect any other byproducts and the Rh
catalyst used is capable of breaking C–C bonds, obviously,
we suspect that there is significant decomposition of material to
compounds that cannot easily be detected in the reaction mixture.

2.2 Kinetic Profile of the Direct Alkylation of 1 Using Hex-1-ene
As entry point to our mechanistic
investigations, we determined the kinetic profile of the olefin alkylation
protocol (Figure 1).12

Figure 1 Determination
of the kinetic time course of direct C–H alkylations
of benzylic amine 1 using hex-1-ene.

There are some features to be noted. First, the reaction
is finished
after 2 h, and the amounts of 4, 5, and 6 remain constant thereafter. This can be rationalized either
by inhibition or decomposition of the active catalyst under these
conditions or by a reversible reaction among 4, 5, and 6. Second, both 4 and 6 are formed more or less from the beginning, and no significant
induction period is observed, except for the time the reaction mixture
needs to reach a constant temperature.13 This is very important because it allows us to easily determine
kinetic parameters by using the method of initial rates (vide infra).
From this kinetic profile, the initial reaction rate under the optimized
reaction conditions was determined (See the Supporting Information for details).

2.3 Side
Product Studies
To gain more
information about the side products observed in the reaction using
alkenes, several experiments that subjected these side products to
the reaction conditions were conducted (Table 2).

the By-Products 5 and 6 in the Direct C–H

b Sum
of amounts of 5 and 6 was considered as
1 equiv.

Entries 1 and 2
show that the initial product, 4,
can be converted to the two side products 5 and 6 by subjecting it to the reaction conditions. Without any
alkene present (entry 3), compound 4 is even converted
back to 1, showing that its formation is reversible under
the reaction conditions. Entries 4 and 5 indicate that compound 5 can be converted to 4 under the reaction conditions,
showing that its formation is also reversible. Finally, mixing 5 and 6 in the absence of alkene leads to formation
of 4 (entry 6). Overall, these experiments demonstrate
that the formation of 5 and 6 starting from 4 and the formation of 4 from 1 are,
in principle, reversible and that C–C bond cleavages are occurring
in the reaction mixture to a significant extent.

Interestingly,
no side product deriving from bisalkylation of the
benzylic position was detected in any experiment. One possible explanation
is that formation of a quaternary carbon is disfavored because of
steric hindrance. Alternatively, if the alkylation does not occur
on the amine substrate 1 but proceeds via an imine intermediate
thereof, formation of a quaternary carbon is impossible. This can
be considered as a first finding, pointing toward an imine mechanism.
In addition, in a similar system using imines with the same directing
group and also employing Rh(I) catalysis, similar C–C activation
reactions are already known.14

2.4 Base Studies
In the reaction using
alkenes, a very pronounced dependence of the initial rate on the adsorbed
water content of K2CO315 was found, which is depicted in Figure 2.
The higher the content of adsorbed water in the base, the higher the
observed initial reaction rate.

Figure 2 Dependence of the initial reaction rate
on the adsorbed water content
of K2CO3 for the direct C–H alkylation
using hex-1-ene in dry toluene.

That water is beneficial for C–H activation reactions
is
already known in some cases.16 However,
to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on using a
base effectively insoluble in the reaction solvent containing superficially
adsorbed water to increase the reaction rate. At present, this significant
dependence on the adsorbed water content cannot be satisfactorily
interpreted, and further investigations need to be carried out.

2.5 Kinetic Isotope Effect Studies
To
gain more information about the rate-determining step of the reaction,
kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies were conducted. In C–H
activation reactions, one major question is always whether the oxidative
addition of the metal catalyst into the C–H bond is rate-determining.
Therefore, in a first study, the KIE of the benzylic C–H bonds
was determined (Scheme 3) by measuring the
initial rate of the reaction with the deuterated compound 1a and comparing it with the initial rate we determined for 1 under the same reaction conditions.

Scheme 3 Determination of
the KIE of the Benzylic C–H Bonds in the
Direct C–H Alkylation of 1 Using Hex-1-ene
The large observed value indicates
a primary KIE and suggests that
the benzylic C–H bond is broken in the rate-determining step;
that is, oxidative addition into the C–H bond is rate-determining.
There are several things to notice. First, the KIE is independent
of the adsorbed water content of K2CO3. This
is very important so that the result can be compared with the KIE
study of the N–H bond (vide infra). Second, there is significant
H–D exchange observed in unreacted 1a during the
reaction. Actually, the H–D exchange is higher than the total
amount of products formed (details in the Supporting Information). This seems contradictory to the primary KIE observed
because this would suggest a (compared with the overall reaction rate)
fast and reversible C–H activation. However, it makes perfect
sense if the reaction proceeds over the corresponding imine via a
fast, reversible amine-to-imine interconversion, which would account
for the H–D exchange observed. The consecutive oxidative addition
into the sp2-hybridized C–H bond would then be rate-determining,
accounting for the large primary KIE.

In a second study, the
KIE of the N–H bond was determined
(Scheme 4) to find out whether this hypothesis
could be supported. The KIE was determined by comparing the initial
reaction rate of deuterated compound 1b and the initial
rate obtained for the undeuterated compound 1 under the
same reaction conditions. It should be noted that this is not an easy
experiment to perform because the N–D readily exchanges with
any H2O that is introduced into the reaction mixture. The
concomitant extent of H–D exchange has to be minimized to obtain
a meaningful result.

Scheme 4 Determination of the KIE of the N–H
Bond in the Direct C–H
Alkylation of 1 Using Hex-1-ene
Before the value is discussed, it is important to mention
that
because of the adsorbed water introduced with K2CO3, the H–D exchange in this experiment series was high.17 Using K2CO3 with 2% of
adsorbed water resulted in an H–D exchange low enough (even
though still 56%) to determine the KIE reliably by correcting the
observed initial rate (see the Supporting Information for details). The small KIE value observed for the N–H bond
indicates that the N–H bond is not broken in the rate-determining
step, excluding a mechanism in which one of the benzylic C–H
bonds and the N–H bond are broken simultaneously.18 However, it rather suggests a secondary KIE,
which would support the previously established hypothesis of a fast,
reversible imine formation prior to rate-determining oxidative addition
into the C–H bond.

2.6 Substrate Scope Investigation:
Tertiary Amines
The simplest experiment series to support
or exclude an imine mechanism
is to test whether tertiary benzylic amines are converted to the corresponding
alkylated products under the reaction conditions (Scheme 5). If the formation of the corresponding products
was observed at a similar rate as compared with secondary benzylic
amines, this would be evidence against an imine mechanism because
the formation of the corresponding iminium ion is not expected to
be occurring at a similar rate, if possible at all.19

Scheme 5 Attempted Alkylation of Tertiary Benzylic Amines 7a and 7b
In neither experiment were any alkylated products observed,
even
after 24 h of reaction time, again supporting the hypothesis of the
reaction proceeding over the corresponding imines.

2.7 Imine studies
On the basis of our
previous results, the hypothesis is that amine 1 is converted
to imine 9 and gets alkylated and the alkylated imine 10 is then converted back to alkylated amine 4 (Scheme 6). Of course, these interconversions
would occur on a rhodium complex. It should be noted that a similar
amine-to-imine oxidation prior to alkylation has been proposed previously
in the literature.20 However, in that example,
the final reaction product is a ketone, which is formed after hydrolysis
of the imine, so the amine-to-imine interconversion was not reversed.

Scheme 6 Hypothetical General Reaction Course of the Direct C–H Alkylation
of Benzylic Amine 1
It was hypothesized that if imines 9 and 10 were intermediates in the reaction, they should be converted
to
the products of the reaction under the reaction conditions. However,
subjecting only imine 9 as starting material to the reaction
conditions resulted in only a very low conversion (see the Supporting Information for more details). Therefore,
crossover experiments were performed using 0.05 equiv of imines 9 and 10, respectively, together with 1 equiv
of amine 1c as starting materials (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Crossover Experiments Investigating Whether Imines 9 and 10 Are Converted to the Corresponding Products
of the Direct C–H Alkylation Using Hex-1-ene Together with
Benzylic Amine 1c
Based on GC analysis of the
reaction mixture with dodecane as internal standard, assuming a conversion
factor of 1 (not calibrated).

Calibrated GC yields.

In the first crossover
experiment, amine 1c was alkylated
in the presence of imine 9, which was completely converted
to the alkylated amine 4. In the second, the same amine, 1c, was reacted in the presence of alkylated imine 10. Full consumption of 10 was observed, and it was converted
to products 4 (2%), 5 (1%), and 6 (1%) with a total recovery of 80% (4% found from 5% used). These
results show that both imine 9 and alkylated imine 10 are transformed to the corresponding amine products under
the reaction conditions.

2.8 Investigation of Imine
Intermediate Kinetics
All previous experiments are in agreement
with a reaction mechanism
proceeding via the imines 9 and 10. Still,
a reaction mechanism in which the alkylation takes place at the amine
and the imines are formed in off-cycle reactions cannot yet be excluded.
All three mechanistic scenarios depicted in Scheme 8 are possible. Either imines 9 and 10 are formed as off-cycle products from 1 and 4, respectively (scenario 1), or the reaction mechanism is proceeding
through imines 9 and 10 as intermediates,
with the alkylation taking place at the imine (scenario 2). Scenario
3 is a combination of those two cases in which both pathways occur
at a similar rate.

Scheme 8 Possible Mechanistic Scenarios for the Direct C–H
Alkylation
of Benzylic Amine 1 Using Alkenes
For simplicity, schemes are
not fully stoichiometrically balanced.

To
distinguish between scenarios 1 and 2, we developed a method
based on simplified kinetic models. Because compounds 10 and 4 are interconvertible, the change of the ratio
of these two compounds over time can deliver the desired information.
If the ratio of the concentrations of 10 and 4 is decreasing over time in an initial reaction period, it would
mean that 10 is formed before 4 in the course
of the reaction, supporting the imine mechanism. If the same ratio
is increasing, the opposite is true.21 The
complete mathematical background of this method is given in the Supporting Information. However, it is also shown
in the Supporting Information that experimentally,
the third mechanistic scenario is very hard if not impossible to exclude
by this method.

Figure 3 Time course of the ratio of the GC areas under the peaks
of imine 10 and amine 4.

Plotting the ratio of imine 10 to
amine 4 over time, the following result was obtained
(Figure 3). The decreasing ratio of imine 10 to amine 4 over time is in accordance with
mechanistic scenario 2 in
which the reaction occurs at the imine, not at the amine, and excludes
scenario 1. However, as already mentioned, mechanistic scenario 3
in which both pathways occur at a similar rate cannot be excluded.
Because mechanistic scenario 2 is the significantly simpler explanation
for all our observations, we prefer it over scenario 3. Either way,
the reaction would proceed (at least to a significant extent) over
the corresponding imines.

2.9 Mechanistic proposal
On the basis
of our experimental results, we propose the following general mechanistic
outline for the direct C–H alkylation using alkenes (Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Mechanistic Proposal for the Direct C–H
Alkylation of Benzylic
Amines Using Alkenes
The rate-determining
step
is indicated by a significantly shorter forward reaction arrow. “H2” emphasizes that it is not known how the two hydrogen
atoms are bonded to the catalyst.

The catalytic
cycle starts with coordination of 1 to
a rhodium species (I in Scheme 9), then the corresponding amine complex II is reversibly
interconverted to the corresponding imine (III), which
is supported by the H–D exchange observed in unreacted 1 in the KIE studies of the benzylic C–H bond. Imine 9 can then be released from this complex (not depicted in
Scheme 9) or it reacts in the rate-determining
oxidative addition into the sp2-hybridized C–H bond
to form a cyclometalated intermediate, IV, which is supported
by the large KIE of about 4–5 observed for the benzylic C–H
bond. Then, alkylation of intermediate IV with alkene
yields the rhodium complex V of the alkylated imine 10. This imine can now be reversibly released (not depicted
in Scheme 9) or it is converted to the alkylated
amine coordinated to Rh (VI), which is released as the
main product of the reaction. Since the whole reaction is shown to
be in principle reversible, all mechanistic steps are also depicted
to be reversible.

It should be noted that additional ligands
coordinated to Rh were
omitted because nothing is known about them on the basis of our experiments.
In addition, it is not known how the two hydrogen atoms are bonded
to the catalyst. If they would be bonded directly to Rh, the oxidative
addition into the C(sp2)–H bond of the imine would
result in a Rh(V) species that is not very common in literature but
was reported on previous occasions, although on different complex
systems.22 Alternatively, the interconversion
of amine and imine could also proceed by transfer hydrogenations with
a ligand on Rh. Transfer hydrogenations employing rhodium catalysis
are quite common in the literature.23

Altogether, there are several important issues that remain open
in this mechanistic investigation. First, almost nothing is known
about the intermediate Rh species involved in the catalytic cycle.
Second, the mechanism of the amine-to-imine interconversion is not
known, either. Third, the role of K2CO3 and
the water introduced with it need to be investigated. The last major
unresolved issue is how the exchange between H and Ph in the interconversions
of 4 and byproducts 5 and 6 actually occurs. These points certainly need to be addressed in
follow-up studies, which are under way in our lab to get more insight
into the reaction mechanism.

3 Conclusion
Benzylic amines were alkylated using both alkyl bromides and alkenes,
and the latter transformation was investigated in detail. Kinetic
and mechanistic evidence shows that the reaction does not proceed
directly over the amines but instead over the corresponding imines,
showing that the formal C(sp3)–H activation reaction
proceeds mechanistically over an C(sp2)–H activation
pathway. Additional experiments need to be performed to investigate
the role of K2CO3 in the reaction and gain insight
into the nature of the rhodium complexes involved in the catalytic
cycle. Furthermore, the alkylation using alkyl bromides needs to be
investigated and exploited further because gaseous short-chain alkenes
could be avoided using the corresponding alkyl bromides.

Cyclohexanol, which was added in our arylation
protocols in order to suppress formation of significant amounts of
the corresponding imine of the arylated product, could be omitted
since no significant formation of imine byproduct was detected in
the alkylation in its absence.

All chemical reactions showing consecutive
reaction kinetics like multiple step catalytic processes have in fact
an induction period for the formation of the final product. However,
in many cases it is too short to be determined reliably.

The water content in K2CO3 was determined by the loss on heating by heating
the solid
up to about 200 °C under medium vacuum overnight assuming that
only water was lost.

The H–D exchange
in the deuterated
amine was determined by means of transmission IR spectroscopy. Details
are given in the Supporting Information.


In general, the absence
of a (significant)
KIE is not evidence that the corresponding bond is not broken in the
rate-determining step. Since in our case a primary KIE was already
observed for the benzylic C–H bonds, however, we could conclude
that the N–H bond is not broken in the rate-determining step.


Of course, this experiment would
not completely
exclude an imine mechanism even if the corresponding alkylation products
were formed at a similar rate because the reaction could theoretically
occur then via a different mechanism.
