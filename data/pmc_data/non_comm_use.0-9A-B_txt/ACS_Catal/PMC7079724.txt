Diverse
C–H functionalizations catalyzed by Pd employ Ag(I)
salts added as halide abstractors or oxidants. Recent reports have
shown that Ag can also perform the crucial C–H activation step
in several of these functionalizations. However, all of these processes
are limited by the wasteful requirement for (super)stoichiometric
Ag(I) salts. Herein, we report the development of a Ag/Pd cocatalyzed
direct arylation of (fluoroarene) chromium tricarbonyl complexes with
bromoarenes. The small organic salt, NMe4OC(CF3)3, added as a halide abstractor, enables the use of a
catalytic amount of Ag, reversing the rapid precipitation of AgBr.
We have shown through H/D scrambling and kinetic studies that a (PR3)Ag-alkoxide is responsible for C–H activation, a departure
from previous studies with Ag carboxylates. Furthermore, the construction
of biaryls directly from the simple arene is achieved via a one-pot
chromium tricarbonyl complexation/C–H arylation/decomplexation
sequence using (pyrene)Cr(CO)3 as a Cr(CO)3 donor.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, direct C–H arylation has become a versatile
tool for the construction of biaryls. This transformation typically
involves in situ metalation of an aryl C–H bond and subsequent
coupling with an aryl donor. Many different transition metals have
been found to catalyze this transformation, including Rh,1 Ru,2 Ir,3 Co,4 Cu,5 Fe,6 and Au,7 but the most frequently used continues to be
Pd.8

In contrast to the mild conditions
possible for C–H arylations
using bis(aryliodonium) salts and iodoarenes as coupling partners,9 the use of bromoarenes in Pd-catalyzed direct
arylation reactions typically requires high temperature and electron-donating
phosphine ligands to facilitate the more challenging oxidative addition
step.10 Intriguingly, Hartwig demonstrated
that the electron-donating phosphine ligand actually inhibits the
Pd(II)-mediated C–H activation step of simple arenes.11 This presents a quandary for how to approach
reaction design for direct arylation with bromoarenes, as any ligand
used must strike a delicate balance between promoting oxidative addition
and inhibiting C–H activation. With this issue in mind, we
envisaged that a cooperative bimetallic catalytic system, in which
an electron-rich Pd undergoes oxidative addition and mediates C–C
bond formation while another metal performs C–H activation,
could provide a resourceful solution.

Ag(I) salts are often
employed as stoichiometric halide abstractors
in Pd-catalyzed direct arylation reactions, particularly those using
iodoarenes as coupling partners, to prevent inhibition of the Pd catalyst.9,12 We recently demonstrated through H/D exchange, stoichiometric and
kinetic studies that phosphine-ligated Ag-carboxylate salts are actually
responsible for the crucial C–H activation step in the Pd-catalyzed
arylation of electron-deficient arenes (Scheme 1a).13 Simultaneously,
Sanford reported similar observations on the oxidative homocoupling
of thiophenes and fluoroarenes (Scheme 1b).14 Hartwig further demonstrated
that AgOPiv mediated the C–H activation in a regioselective
Pd-catalyzed allylation of simple arenes (Scheme 1c).15 Recently,
we uncovered an unexpected mechanistic switch in the direct arylation
of (benzo)thiophenes, in which a Pd-catalyzed β-arylation was
outcompeted by a Ag-mediated (but still Pd-catalyzed) α-arylation
at low concentrations of Pd (Scheme 1d).16 In all of these methodologies,
however, super-stoichiometric Ag salts were found to be required for
reactivity.

Scheme 1 Ag(I)-Mediated C–H Functionalizations in Pd/Ag
Systems
More recently, a Ag/Au cocatalyzed
oxidative coupling between fluoroarenes
and pyrazoles was demonstrated to proceed via Ag-catalyzed C–H
activation of the electron-deficient coupling partner.17 Although no analogous Ag/Pd cocatalyzed system
has yet been developed, we reasoned that such a system would make
an ideal direct arylation with bromoarene coupling partners. However,
a number of challenges would need to be addressed to develop such
a process: (1) Ag(I) salts are oxidizing agents and can oxidize electron-rich
Pd(0)-species to Pd(II), which could present a problem when using
bromoarenes instead of the more reactive iodoarenes; (2) Ag(I) forms
highly insoluble bromide salts, which would quickly remove the catalyst
as the reaction progresses. Herein, we report the development of the
first Ag/Pd cocatalyzed C–H arylation system and its application
to the mild arylation of fluorobenzene derivatives with bromoarenes
(Scheme 1e).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Development of a Ag/Pd
Cocatalyzed C–H
Arylation Process Using Bromoarenes as Coupling Partners
We began our investigation testing conditions we previously developed
for the direct arylation of (fluoroarene)Cr(CO)3 with iodoarenes.18 When these conditions were applied to the arylation
of 3-fluorotoluene chromium tricarbonyl 1a with bromobenzene 2a, no reaction was detected (Table 1, entry 1), in line with our previous observation.18 Our group recently reported that adding up to
60 mol % of PPh3 had a beneficial effect on the reaction
rate for the Pd-catalyzed direct C–H arylation with iodoarenes,
due to a faster Ag-mediated C–H activation step.13 In this case, however, this additive did not
enable reactivity (entry 2). The results in entries 1 and 2 suggested
that the oxidative addition step with less reactive bromobenzene (vs
iodoarenes) may be problematic. Accordingly, the addition of 20 mol
% of SPhos, a more electron-donating ligand than PPh3,
resulted in a small amount of desired product 3aa (entry
3). We postulated that deactivation of Pd(0) via oxidation to Pd(II)
by the Ag(I) salt could be competing with the oxidative addition of
bromoarene 2a. Thus, a reduction of the amount of Ag(I)
salts employed could be beneficial by reducing the rate of undesired
Pd oxidation. Our group has previously reported on the use of NMe4 salts as halide abstractors as an alternative to Ag(I) salts
in a range of Pd- and Ru-catalyzed direct arylations.19 We hypothesized that NMe4 salts may be able
to regenerate active Ag(I)-species from unreactive AgBr and thus be
suitable stoichiometric bromide abstractors for this process (Scheme 1e, box). This would
allow the use of the Ag(I) salt to mediate C–H activation in
a catalytic fashion, while slowing down the deleterious Pd(0)-oxidation
pathway. To test this hypothesis, we lowered the Ag(I) salt loading
to 0.1 equiv of Ag2CO3, in combination with
1.5 equiv of NMe4OC(CF3)3 (entry
4). Gratifyingly, the 7.5-fold reduction in the Ag loading led to
a marked increase in reactivity, providing a 12% yield of 3aa. Further optimization revealed that Buchwald’s precatalyst Pd-G2 led to a significant improvement in the yield of 3aa to 51% (entry 5). Replacing the Ag2CO3 catalyst and AdCO2H additive, with just 20 mol % of AgOCOAd,
in combination with PBuAd2 as a ligand further increased
the yield of 3aa (entry 6). The use of a more active
Pd precatalyst, Pd-G4, in which Cl is avoided, led to
an additional small yield increase (entry 7). Increasing the loading
of K2CO3 to 4 equiv resulted in 73% of 3aa (entry 8). Remarkably, the use of AgBr instead of AgOCOAd
resulted in a significant increase in the reaction efficiency, affording
an excellent 90% yield of 3aa (entry 9). This result
reveals that the carboxylate base is not needed to carry out the C–H
activation in this system, a role that may be played instead by either
carbonate or the perfluoro-tert-butylalkoxide.20 Conversely, the reaction did not proceed at
all in the absence of either the Pd or the Ag catalysts (entries 10
and 11), confirming that both are essential for the observed reactivity.
Note that the mass balance of the reaction was accounted for with
unreacted 1a being recovered.

2.2 Scope of the Ag/Pd Cocatalyzed
C–H
Arylation
Next, the scope of the direct C–H arylation
of fluoroarene–chromium tricarbonyl complexes 1 with aryl bromides 2 as coupling partners (Table 2) was investigated.
The reaction tolerated a variety of functionalities at the para positions of the aryl bromide, affording the corresponding
biaryls (4ba–4bp) in moderate to
excellent yields. Halo groups such as −Cl (4be) and −F (4bf) showed excellent reactivity, widening
the opportunity for further functionalization. Bromoarenes with trifluoromethyl
(4bg) and nitro (4bm) electron-withdrawing
groups afforded 82 and 65% yields, respectively. Aldehyde- and methylketone-bearing
bromoarenes 2h and 2i were not compatible
with our reaction conditions, with starting material recovered unreacted
in both cases. On the other hand, a protected aldehyde (4bj) and a phenylketone (4bk) exhibited very good reactivity.
Low reactivity was observed with cyano (4bl) substituent;
nonetheless, CO2Me (4bn) and alkene (4bo) functional groups were compatible with the system. More
electron-donating SMe (4bd), Me (4bb), and
OMe (4bc) substituents gave good yields. This methodology
was also applicable to meta- (4bq–4bu) and ortho-substituted bromoarenes (4bv–4bx). Additionally, bromoheteroarenes
containing benzofuran (4by) and indole (4bz) cores reacted to afford biaryl products in 99 and 38% yields, respectively.
Aryl triflates and tosylates were found to be unreactive in this system.
Finally, the reaction of 1b with 2a was
scaled up to a 2 mmol scale, giving the desired arylation product 4ba in an 87% yield.

d 3 equiv of bromoarene used.

We then turned our attention to the exploration of the scope of
fluoroarene–chromium complexes with bromobenzene 2a as the coupling partner. The reaction was compatible with both electron-donating
and -withdrawing functionalities such as OMe (4ca), CH2OTIPS (4da), and CO2Me (4ga). When a methyl group was present at the meta position,
the arylation primarily took place at the less hindered site (4aa–4aa′). Finally, when a substituent
was present at para position, bisarylated adducts 4ga–4ha were obtained with 3 equiv of
bromobenzene 2a in good to very good yields.

2.3 Mechanistic Proposal and Mechanistic Studies
The mechanistic
proposal for our Ag/Pd cocatalyzed C–H arylation
of fluorobenzene complex 1 has been outlined in Scheme 2. We hypothesized
that phosphine-ligated Ag(I)-alkoxide III, formed in
situ by the reaction of PBuAd2, AgBr, and NMe4OC(CF3)3, performs C–H activation on
arene complex 1, forming Ag(I)-aryl species IV. These, in turn, enter into a Pd(0)/Pd(II) catalytic cycle through
transmetalation with Pd(II)-alkoxide VI to form VII, while regenerating Ag(I)-species III. Bis-aryl-Pd
species VII then undergoes reductive elimination to form
the product 3.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Ag(I)/Pd Cocatalyzed
C–H Arylation
of Fluorobenzene Derivatives with Bromoarenes
We first investigated the proposed Ag-catalyzed C–H activation
step. By treating complex 1b with various components
from our reaction system, in the presence of D2O, we studied
the H/D exchange resulting from a reversible C–H activation
process (Table 3).
The use of 20 mol % of AgBr only and in combination with either 20
mol % of PBuAd2 or 1.5 equiv NMe4OC(CF3)3 afforded no deuteration of 1b (Table 3, entries 1–3).
As predicted, when all three components were used in combination,
50% deuteration of 1b was observed after only 2 h (Table 3, entry 4). This result
indicates that perfluoro-tert-butoxide is a suitable
base to carry out C–H activation in combination with Ag(I),
despite its monodentate nature, but only in the presence of the phosphine
ligand. Further addition of K2CO3 as a terminal
base further enhanced the deuteration of 1b, yielding
83% of deuterated starting material 1b (Table 3, entry 5). The beneficial effect
of K2CO3 could be explained through the removal
of perfluoro-tert-butanol from the mixture, as shown
in Scheme 2, thus favoring
the C–H activation equilibrium toward IV. When 1b was instead treated with D2O under the standard
coupling conditions but in the absence of AgBr, no deuteration or
biaryl coupling was observed (Table 3, entry 6), further demonstrating key role of the Ag(I)
salt in the C–H activation step. These results point toward
a similar overall mechanism to those observed in our previous studies
of Ag-mediated C–H activation,13,16 albeit with
subtly different kinetically relevant steps. Here, instead of rate-limiting
transmetalation or C–H activation, we observe a situation where
both of these steps are kinetically relevant.

a Ratios were determined

Given
the well-known affinity of Ag(I) for bromide,21 we carried out stoichiometric NMR studies to
determine whether NMe4OC(CF3)3 is
indeed able to abstract the bromide and generate the proposed Ag(I)-alkoxide.
When PBuAd2 and AgBr were mixed with NMe4OC(CF3)3, the formation of (PBuAd2)AgOC(CF3)3 could be confirmed by 31P and 19F NMR (see Figures S3 and S4 in
the Supporting Information). The identity and structure of (PBuAd2)AgOC(CF3)3 (III) were
confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 1). These experiments are consistent
with both the formation of Ag-alkoxide III from AgBr
and its proposed role on the C–H activation of 1 (Scheme 2).

All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

To further investigate the reaction mechanism, we applied reaction
progress kinetic analysis (RPKA)22 and
variable-time normalization analysis (VTNA).23 We began by examining the stability of the catalysts during the
reaction by carrying out two kinetic runs under “same-excess”
conditions (Figure 2). A time-adjusted plot24 (Figure 2a) from reactions carried out
with initial concentrations of either 0.1 or 0.15 M of 1b (and an [excess] of 0.05 M) showed a small but reproducible deviation
between the two traces. This suggested that either product inhibition
and/or catalyst deactivation were occurring. We thought that perfluoro-tert-butanol, formed in the C–H activation step,
may be responsible for the slight inhibition observed. When the same-excess
experiment was repeated under standard conditions with 0.05 M of added
perfluoro-tert-butanol, a good match was obtained
(Figure 2b) between
the two kinetic runs, confirming the small inhibitory effect of this
side product and indicating that no significant catalyst decomposition
is occurring. Therefore, VTNA could still be applied to determine
the orders on the different components in the reaction (Figure 3).23 The kinetic analyses revealed positive orders on both catalysts,
Pd and Ag, and arene 1b and an order zero on bromoarene 2b. These data are consistent with both the transmetalation
(IV and VI to III and VII) and the C–H activation (III and 1 to IV) steps contributing to the rate of the
reaction simultaneously, with the C–H activation step being
in quasi-equilibrium. An order of 0.5 in Ag catalyst suggests the
existence of an inactive Ag(I)-dimer resting state (such as II) in equilibrium with active monomeric Ag(I)-alkoxide III, which performs kinetically relevant C–H activation.25 The partial order in Pd is typical of cocatalyzed
processes where the order may range from 0 to 1, depending on the
rate of the interconnecting step. For example, in our case, the partial
order in Pd is consistent with a relatively fast, but still relevant,
transmetalation step. An order of 0.7 in 1b indicates
that the C–H activation step is an equilibrium displaced toward 1b. An order of 0 in bromoarene 2b indicates
that the oxidative addition to Pd(0) is not involved in the rate of
the reaction and suggests that this step is fast. The order in NMe4OC(CF3)3 salt could not be determined
due to its very low solubility in toluene; however, kinetic runs with
different stirring rates provided identical reaction profiles, suggesting
that the order may be zero.26 Taken together
with the H/D exchange experiments in Table 3, these results are strongly consistent with
the proposed mechanism. In support of our analysis, we simulated the
proposed mechanism using COPASI,27 which
allowed the identification of a set of kinetic constants replicating
the observed kinetic orders for all reaction components (see Figure S13 in the Supporting Information).

2.4 One-Pot
Protocol with in Situ Formation of
Cr Complex
Finally, we considered whether we could further
improve the practical utility of this C–H arylation methodology
by developing a one-pot protocol that would start from the fluoroarene,
rather than its Cr complex. Achieving such a process would require
developing a mild set of complexation conditions that would be compatible
with the subsequent arylation step. Typical standard conditions for
the synthesis of (arene)Cr(CO)3 complexes involve reflux
in nBu2O for prolonged periods
and would therefore be unsuitable for a one-pot protocol. Previous
studies have shown that polyarene–Cr complexes are able to
undergo arene exchange under relatively mild conditions.28 A survey of such polyarene complexes revealed
(pyrene)Cr(CO)3 (1l) as a suitable Cr(CO)3 donor for the efficient formation of fluorobenzene complexes
(Scheme S10 and Table S9 in the Supporting
Information). Accordingly, a mixture of 1l and fluorotoluene 5b in dioxane heated at 90 °C for 16 h afforded 1b in an excellent 86% yield (Scheme 3a). Gratifyingly, this protocol for the preparation
of 1b was found to be compatible with the subsequent
arylation reaction conditions. Thus, simple addition to the same flask
of bromoarene 2a and the other arylation components,
followed by in situ decomplexation, afforded 3ba in a
54% yield (Scheme 3b). This proof-of-principle reaction sets the stage for the extension
of this methodology with free fluoroarene substrates in one pot without
isolating the chromium tricarbonyl complex, thus increasing its practicality
and synthetic utility.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed
the first Ag/Pd cocatalyzed C–H
arylation process. This catalytic system is capable of regioselective
direct C–H arylation of fluoroarenes with bromoarenes using
π-complexation to Cr(CO)3 to enhance the fluoroarene
reactivity. Key to developing this protocol was the identification
of NMe4OC(CF3)3 as a halide abstractor
capable of removing Br from AgBr, to regenerate the catalytic Ag-species.
This system is able to operate under relatively mild conditions using
Ag(I) to carry out the C–H activation and Pd to carry out the
bromoarene oxidative addition and reductive elimination steps, in
a synergistic system. Our proposed mechanism is fully consistent with
H/D exchange experiments, in situ NMR identification of catalytic
intermediates, and observed partial kinetic orders on both catalysts
and the arene substrate. We have also developed a new one-pot sequential
arene complexation/arylation technique for the synthesis of biaryls.
This investigation opens the door for the future development of Ag/Pd
cocatalyzed systems for C–H functionalization.
