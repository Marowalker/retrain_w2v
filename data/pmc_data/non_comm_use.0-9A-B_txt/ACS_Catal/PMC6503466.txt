The
enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) exploits an N-terminal
proline as main catalytic residue to facilitate several promiscuous
C–C bond-forming reactions via enzyme-bound enamine intermediates.
Here we show that the active site of this enzyme can give rise to
further synthetically useful catalytic promiscuity. Specifically,
the F50A mutant of 4-OT was found to efficiently promote asymmetric
Michael additions of nitromethane to various α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes to give γ-nitroaldehydes, important precursors to
biologically active γ-aminobutyric acids. High conversions,
high enantiocontrol, and good isolated product yields were achieved.
The reactions likely proceed via iminium ion intermediates formed
between the catalytic Pro-1 residue and the α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes. In addition, a cascade of three 4-OT(F50A)-catalyzed reactions
followed by an enzymatic oxidation step enables assembly of γ-nitrocarboxylic
acids from three simple building blocks in one pot. Our results bridge
organo- and biocatalysis, and they emphasize the potential of enzyme
promiscuity for the preparation of important chiral synthons.

==== Body
The γ-nitroaldehydes are
important chiral building blocks for the preparation of biologically
active γ-aminobutyric acids. The asymmetric synthesis of γ-nitroaldehydes
from simple starting materials has become feasible because of outstanding
developments within the organocatalysis field, particularly fueled
by aminocatalysis.1 This is nicely illustrated
by the work of Hayashi and co-workers, who reported that diphenylprolinol
silyl ether can promote the asymmetric synthesis of γ-nitroaldehydes
through alternative Michael-type reactions: enamine-mediated addition
of aldehydes to nitroalkenes, and nitroalkane addition to α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes activated as iminium ions.1d−1f

Inspired by these
developments in the organocatalysis field, work
from our laboratory focused on the development of a biocatalytic procedure
for asymmetric synthesis of γ-nitroaldehydes. We reported that
4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT), which utilizes a unique N-terminal
proline as key catalytic residue, can promiscuously catalyze the Michael
addition of acetaldehyde (as well as various other aldehydes) to nitroalkenes
yielding enantioenriched γ-nitroaldehydes (Scheme 1A).2 The catalytic mechanism involves the formation of an enamine species
between acetaldehyde and the Pro-1 residue (pKa ∼6.4).3,4 Hilvert and co-workers have reported
a highly engineered computationally designed artificial aldolase,
RA95.5–8, which can catalyze the asymmetric synthesis of γ-nitroketones
(but not γ-nitroaldehydes) via acetone addition to nitrostyrenes
and nitroalkane addition to conjugated ketones.5 However, a biocatalytic methodology for nitroalkane addition
to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to yield enantioenriched
γ-nitroaldehydes is an as yet unmet challenge.

Scheme 1 Proposed
Mechanisms for the 4-OT-Catalyzed Michael Additions of Acetaldehyde
to Nitroalkenes (A) and Nitromethane to α,β-Unsaturated
Aldehydes (B) To Yield γ-Nitroaldehydes
Here, we report that the F50A mutant of the 4-OT enzyme
can efficiently
promote asymmetric Michael additions of nitromethane to α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes, yielding various γ-nitroaldehydes with high enantiopurity
(e.r. up to >99:1) and in high isolated yield (61–96%).
The
catalytic mechanism appears to involve formation of enzyme-bound iminium
ion intermediates in a manner reminiscent of organocatalysis (Scheme 1B).

We previously
reported that 4-OT catalyzes the aldol condensation
of acetaldehyde with benzaldehyde to yield cinnamaldehyde.3,6 Considering that the active site of 4-OT can accommodate cinnamaldehyde,
this aromatic α,β-unsaturated aldehyde was tested as potential
Michael acceptor substrate. Cinnamaldehyde was expected to react with
Pro-1, the catalytic amine, to form a covalently bound iminium ion
intermediate, which could be attacked by nitromethane (Scheme 1B). This Michael reaction was
performed in the presence of wild-type 4-OT in HEPES buffer (pH 7.3),
containing 5% (v/v) EtOH, 200 mM of nitromethane (1, Scheme 2), and 3 mM of cinnamaldehyde
(2a), and reaction progress was monitored by following
the depletion of 2a by UV–vis spectrophotometry.
Under these conditions, 50% of substrate 2a was consumed
in 24 h, and the corresponding product 3a was obtained
in 35% isolated yield (as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy).
Analysis of product 3a by chiral HPLC revealed high enantiocontrol
at the site of addition with formation of the (R)-configured
product (e.r. of 86:14). Interestingly, we earlier reported that wild-type
4-OT catalyzes the Michael addition of acetaldehyde to trans-β-nitrostyrene to yield (S)-3a with an e.r. of 95:5.2a Hence, 4-OT catalyzes
the synthesis of γ-nitroaldehyde 3a via two enantiocomplementary
Michael reactions: enamine-mediated addition of acetaldehyde to trans-β-nitrostyrene and nitromethane addition to
cinnamaldehyde likely activated as iminium ion.

Scheme 2 Wild-Type 4-OT-Catalyzed
Michael Addition of Nitromethane (1) to Cinnamaldehyde
(2a) To Yield γ-Nitroaldehyde
(R)-3a
Encouraged by these initial findings, a systematic mutagenesis
approach was applied to enhance this promiscuous Michael addition
activity of 4-OT. For this, an earlier constructed collection of 4-OT
genes coding for almost all possible single-mutant variants of 4-OT
was used.7 Improved variants (>2-fold
increase
in activity) were identified by monitoring the depletion of 2a in a spectrophotometric kinetic assay in multiwell plates.
Given that several mutations at positions Met-45 and Ala-46 (M45G,
M45H, M45S, A46H, and A46S) result in a slight improvement in activity
(∼3-fold), three mutations at position Phe-50 (F50I, F50V,
and F50A) significantly enhanced the Michael addition activity. Assays
with the purified mutant enzymes showed a 6-fold, 8-fold and 15-fold
increase in activity for F50I, F50V, and F50A, respectively (Figure S1). Further characterization of the Michael
reaction between 1 and 2a catalyzed by the
best 4-OT variant (F50A) showed that besides increased activity, this
mutant enzyme also has enhanced stereoselectivity, allowing the production
of optically pure (R)-3a (e.r. 99:1)
in high isolated yield of 92% (Table 1, entry 1; Figures S2–S4). These results underscore the potential of the highly promiscuous
4-OT enzyme for evolutionary optimization. At semipreparative scale,
the 4-OT(F50A)-catalyzed Michael addition of 1 (50 mM,
152 mg in 50 mL) to 2a (25 mM, 157 mg in 50 mL) gave
product (R)-3a (96% conversion in 11
h) in good isolated yield (204.7 mg, 85% yield) and with a high e.r.
of 98:2 (Figures S34, S35).

used at 2 mM).

g Further purified using flash column
chromatography.

Notably,
the mutation F50A was previously found to improve the
aldol condensation activity of 4-OT.6a This
mutation makes the active site pocket of 4-OT more accessible to the
outside aqueous environment, without changing the pKa of Pro-1 too much, and likely enhances the aldol condensation
activity of 4-OT by promoting the final hydrolysis step in which product
is released from Pro-1, which has been suggested to be rate-limiting.6a Similarly, the F50A mutation may increase the
Michael addition activity of 4-OT by making the active site more amenable
for hydrolytic cleavage of the covalent enzyme–product intermediate.

Having established that 4-OT(F50A) can efficiently promote the
asymmetric Michael addition of 1 to 2a,
a set of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes was prepared (see Support Information for details) and tested as
Michael acceptor substrates. The results demonstrate that the 4-OT(F50A)
enzyme has a broad substrate scope, accepting both aromatic and aliphatic
Michael acceptor substrates, and catalyzes the addition of 1 to the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes 2b–k to yield the corresponding γ-nitroaldehydes 3b–k with excellent enantiopurity (e.r.
up to >99:1) and in good isolated yield (61–96%) (Table 1, Figures S5–S33). Interestingly, the enzymatic Michael
reactions with meta- and para-substituted
cinnamaldehydes (2c,d and 2f–j) provided the corresponding products as the
(R)-configured enantiomers, while those with the ortho-substituted cinnamaldehydes (2b and 2e) yielded the (S)-configured product enantiomers
(Table 1, entries 2
and 5). This suggests that positioning substituents on the ortho position of the substrate promoted steric effects,
which caused either substrate relocation in the enzyme active site
or a stereofacial shielding effect. Notably, the consequence of ortho-substituents on the stereochemical outcome of organo-
and biocatalytic reactions with aromatic aldol and Michael acceptor
substrates has been observed before.2d,8

We next
investigated whether the mechanism of the 4-OT(F50A)-catalyzed
Michael reaction proceeds via iminium ion formation between Pro-1
and the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde substrate. A 4-OT(F50A)
sample modified by 2a in the presence of NaBH4 and an unmodified 4-OT(F50A) sample were digested with Glu-C (an
endoproteinase from Staphylococcus aureus V8), and the generated peptides were characterized by LC-MS (Figures S43–S45). Comparing the peaks
of the modified 4-OT(F50A) sample to those of the nonmodified 4-OT(F50A)
sample revealed a modification of the fragment PIAQIHILE by a species
with a mass of 116 Da. This corresponds to labeling by one cinnamaldehyde
molecule. Characterization of the remaining peaks revealed no labeling
of other fragments (Figures S44, S45).
Within the N-terminal fragment Pro-1 to Glu-9, the most probable positions
for alkylation are Pro-1 and His-6. To identify the labeled residue,
the modified and unmodified peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Figure S46). The spectrum of the ion corresponding
to the unlabled PIAQIHILE peptide showed the characteristic b5 ion
resulting from the peptide fragment PIAQI. MS/MS analysis of the modified
PIAQIHILE peptide revealed a mass increase of 116 Da for this b5 ion.
Therefore, it can be concluded that Pro-1 is the sole site of modification
by 2a. This result supports the hypothesis that Pro-1
functions as an amine catalyst in the enzymatic addition reaction,
increasing the electrophilicity of the Michael acceptor through Schiff
base formation (Scheme 1B). Replacement of Pro-1 with an alanine in wild-type 4-OT led to
a 32-fold decrease in activity for the addition of 1 to 2a (Figure S1), providing further
support for this mechanism. Work is in progress to determine the structure
of 4-OT(F50A) covalently modified by 2a.

We have
previously reported that 4-OT(F50A) can catalyze the aldol
condensation of acetaldehyde with benzaldehyde to give cinnamaldehyde.3,6 Here we show that the three different activities observed for the
4-OT(F50A) enzyme can be used to prepare γ-nitroaldehydes in
a biocatalytic cascade involving sequential aldol addition of acetaldehyde
to a suitable aromatic aldehyde, dehydration, and Michael addition
of nitromethane. Inclusion of a suitable aldehyde dehydrogenase and
cofactor-recycling NADH oxidase9 in the
reaction mixture enabled efficient one-pot synthesis of γ-nitrocarboxylic
acids (Scheme 3). Using
acetaldehyde (4), benzaldehyde (5a), and
nitromethane (1) as starting substrates, product (R)-7a was obtained in 53% isolated yield (65%
overall conversion) and with an excellent e.r. of 99:1 (Figures S36–S38). Replacing substrate 5a with 5b, yielded product (S)-7b in 80% isolated yield (>99% overall conversion)
and with an excellent e.r. of 99:1 (Figures S39–S42). This simple and effective cascade further demonstrates the tremendous
potential of combining different enzymes to construct simple synthetic
routes for preparation of important chemical products.

Scheme 3 Four-Step
Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of γ-Nitrobutyric
Acids 7a and 7b in One Pot
The cascade reactions were
performed with 1 (50 mM), 4 (150 mM), and
either 5a or 5b (3 mM).

In summary, our results indicate that the active site of 4-OT can
give rise to synthetically useful promiscuous activities. Like proline-based
organocatalysts, 4-OT utilizes a prolyl amine to attack diverse aldehydes
forming reactive enamine and iminium ion intermediates. Hence, this
natural enzyme with its unique catalytic amino-terminal proline could
possibly accelerate many of the bond-forming reactions promoted by
organocatalysts. We have therefore initiated studies aimed at exploring
alternative nucleophiles for addition to α,β-unsaturated
aldehydes, which would allow for the enzymatic synthesis of additional
products.

In contrast
to difficult to prepare proline- and peptide-based
organocatalysts, the enzyme 4-OT can be produced in large amounts
by simple bacterial fermentation. Moreover, the enzymatic reaction
proceeds in eco-friendly aqueous buffer rather than in organic solvent.
In previous work, we have demonstrated that 4-OT can be engineered
into a more efficient biocatalyst for the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde
with benzaldehyde to yield cinnamaldehyde, with a >5000-fold enhancement
in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) and a >107-fold change in reaction
specificity.6b It is therefore conceivable
that the promiscuous activity of 4-OT(F50A) for the Michael addition
of nitromethane to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can be optimized
by directed evolution to generate novel biocatalysts for practical
synthesis of chiral precursors for important pharmaceuticals.
