The
realization of a synthetic biology approach to microbial (1R,2S,5R)-(−)-menthol (1) production relies on the identification
of a gene encoding an isopulegone isomerase (IPGI), the only enzyme
in the Mentha piperita biosynthetic
pathway as yet unidentified. We demonstrate that Δ5-3-ketosteroid
isomerase (KSI) from Pseudomonas putida can act as an IPGI, producing (R)-(+)-pulegone
((R)-2) from (+)-cis-isopulegone (3). Using a robotics-driven semirational
design strategy, we identified a key KSI variant encoding four active
site mutations, which confer a 4.3-fold increase in activity over
the wild-type enzyme. This was assisted by the generation of crystal
structures of four KSI variants, combined with molecular modeling
of 3 binding to identify key active site residue targets.
The KSI variant was demonstrated to function efficiently within cascade
biocatalytic reactions with downstream Mentha enzymes pulegone reductase and (−)-menthone:(−)-menthol
reductase to generate 1 from 3. This study
introduces the use of a recombinant IPGI, engineered to function efficiently
within a biosynthetic pathway for the production of 1 in microorganisms.

Introduction
Limonene and its related
derivatives are the most abundant, naturally
sourced monoterpenoids known.1 These natural
products are commonly used in the perfume, fragrance, and flavor industries.2,3 For example, (R)-limonene ((R)-4) is the major essential oil constituent of orange peels
and is often found in cleaning products.4 In contrast Mentha piperita (peppermint)
generates (S)-limonene ((S)-4), which is subsequently converted into menthol isomers (Scheme 1A).2,5 The most commercially useful isomer is 1, known by
its characteristic cooling anesthetic effects and aroma.6 It also has antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory
activities, making it a valuable natural product.7−10

Commercially, 1 is utilized both
as a pure compound
and as a component of the essential oil of peppermint, with an estimated
30000 tons consumed annually.11 While the
majority of 1 is extracted from Mentha
canadensis, a large proportion is generated synthetically
(US $300 million annually).12 The two major
synthetic routes to 1 are the Haarmann–Reimer
route from m-cresol and the Takasago synthesis utilizing
β-pinene.13 However, the flavor and
fragrance industries and/or consumers may demand that these compounds
be supplied from natural sources, particularly when they are used
as food additives.

Naturally sourced peppermint oil can vary
in both relative composition
of its monoterpenoid constituents and overall yields due to fluctuating
environmental conditions. This leads to price volatility and increased
arable land competition for more profitable crops, such as biofuel
biomass production. Optimization of peppermint oil production through
conventional breeding methods is difficult, as it is a sterile hybrid
plant.2,15 Additionally, purification of 1 from essential oil requires expensive and low-yielding steam-distillation
and filtration processes to generate a usable product.16,17 Therefore, alternative clean biosynthetic routes to these compounds
are a commercially attractive prospect to generate 1 with
a “natural” label.

One alternative “natural”
route is to introduce the
biosynthetic pathway of 1 into cost-effective and even
food-compatible microorganisms.18,19 This general synthetic
biology approach generates biological factories, where rapid fine
chemicals production can be achieved sustainably using nonpetroleum
renewable feedstocks, with a reduced land burden and higher product
consistency and purity.20−22 Such an approach has proved commercially
successful in the semisynthetic industrial-scale production (ca. 35
tons per annum) by Sanofi of artemisinin, a major active ingredient
in modern malarial treatments. Similarly, the semisynthetic production
of Taxol has been demonstrated, where microorganism biofactories generated
the precursor taxadiene using introduced pathways.20

We recently described the incorporation of the M.
piperita based biosynthetic pathway from (R)-2 to 1 into Escherichia coli.23 An
in vitro protocol was established where 1 was successfully
generated, utilizing E. coli cell extracts
as the biocatalyst source. However, a more cost-effective route would
be an in vivo approach, where the full pathways from simple carbon
sources to 1 would be incorporated and the microorganisms
would be grown on waste feedstock. The six enzymatic steps from (S)-4 to 1 in Mentha sp. have been well characterized,5,24−30 and the native enzymes for five of these reactions have been sequenced
and functionally expressed in E. coli (Scheme 1A).4,5,23,28,30,31 The remaining
enzyme is isopulegone isomerase (IPGI), which catalyzes the double
bond migrating isomerization (C3–C4 to C2–C3) of 3 to (R)-2 (Scheme 1B).26 Early studies with impure native Mentha IPGI identified a 54 kDa protein complex2,24 exhibiting
cofactor-free isomerization, utilizing a mechanism similar to bacterial
Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerases (KSI).26 Therefore, the IPGI mechanism likely involves deprotonation of the
C2α hydrogen of 3 by an enzymatic proton acceptor
(D40 in KSI), to form an enolate intermediate (Scheme 1B), stabilized by hydrogen-bonding residues
(Y16 and D103 in KSI). A proton-donating residue then transfers its
proton to C4, leading to double bond migration to C2–C3 and
re-formation of the carbonyl group. As no significant ketosteroid
isomerase-like proteins have been annotated in plant genomes, the
protein sequence of native IPGI is likely to remain elusive until
the completion of the full annotation of the Mentha
longifolia genome sequence.32

To complete the construction of a pathway from (S)-4 to 1 in E. coli, we investigated a well-studied bacterial Δ5-3-ketosteroid
isomerase from Pseudomonas putida(14,33,34) and found that it exhibited low
activity toward 3. To improve the IPGI activity, we performed
three rounds of automated mutagenesis to improve yields of 2. The crystal structures of four KSI variants were generated, to
assist the structure-guided mutagenesis approach to improve the binding
of 3 to the enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations and
DFT modeling were applied to the most successful variant, to investigate
the mode of increase in activity. The performance of the optimized
KSI variant within both in vitro and in vivo biotransformation cascades
from 3 to 1 was demonstrated. Therefore,
the identification and optimization of a substitute IPGI is a critical
step in the future generation of a potentially industrial E. coli strain capable of producing “natural” 1.

Experimental Section
Design and Synthesis of KSI Variants
The wild-type
gene sequence encoding the Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase from P. putida (UniProt ID: P07445) was designed using
the GeneGenie online tool, containing a C-terminal His6-tag.35 Mutagenic oligonucleotides for
the first-generation libraries encoding ambiguous codons for 16 residues
were designed optimized for E. coli expression using CodonGenie (Tables S1 and S2).36 Eight overlapping DNA oligonucleotides
(up to 80 nt in length) were used to assemble the full length genes
using the SpeedyGenes gene synthesis method (section S2.5 in the Supporting Information).37,38 Purified genes were ligated into linearized pET21b (Novagen) to
generate a C-terminally His6-tagged enzyme by In-Fusion
cloning (Clontech), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cloning products were transformed into T7 Express competent E. coli cells and grown on LB agar plates containing
100 μg/mL ampicillin, followed by incubation overnight at 37
°C.

The second- and third-generation variants were constructed
using asymmetric PCR mutagenesis,39,40 followed by
ligation into linearized pET21b by In-Fusion cloning. These mutations
were designed as double or triple variants of the first-generation
residues identified as providing hits (V88I, L99X, and D103S). The
final variant was a combination of four individual positive mutations
(V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S).

Gene Synthesis of Mentha Biocatalysts
The protein sequences for the following enzymes
from M. piperita were obtained from
UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org): pulegone
reductase (MpPGR; Q6WAU0) and (−)-menthone:(−)-menthol
reductase (MMR; Q5CAF4). The respective gene sequences were designed
and synthesized and subcloned into pET21b by GeneArt (ThermoFisher),
incorporating a C-terminal His6-tag and applying codon
optimization techniques of rare codon removal for optimal expression
in E. coli. Each construct was transformed
into E. coli T7 Express and grown on
LB agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, followed by
incubation overnight at 37 °C.

Robotics-Driven Production
and Purification of Variant Libraries
Robotic colony picking
and auto induction media inoculation (Formedium,
100 μg/mL ampicillin) of first-generation libraries were performed
in deep-well plates (Hamilton Robotics), including replica plating
into LB (Formedium, 100 μg/mL ampicillin) for glycerol stock
generation. Plates were covered with a Breathseal sealer (Greiner
Bio-One) and incubated at 30 °C and 1000 rpm for 24 h. Each variant
underwent robotic cell lysis, extraction, and purification using Ni-NTA
resin (Qiagen; 50 μL per variant) prior to enzymatic assays
(see section S3.1 in the Supporting Information
for details). Enzyme concentrations were determined using the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

KSI Variant
Biotransformation Screen
Substrate 3 (85% purity)
was synthesized by Dr. Aisling Miller (University
of Manchester), using a combination of chemical and enzymatic transformations.41 Reactions (200 μL) were performed in 50
mM Tris pH 7.0 containing 3 (1 mM) and KSI extract (189
μL) and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h (180 rpm). Samples
were prepared for GCMS analysis by solvent extraction with 180 μL
of ethyl acetate containing 0.01% sec-butylbenzene
as the internal standard and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. GC-MS achiral quantitative analysis was conducted on a 7890B GC
coupled to a 5975 series MSD quadrupole mass spectrometer and equipped
with a 7693 autosampler (Agilent Technologies). Chiral product analysis
was performed by analyzing reactions by GC using an Agilent Technologies
7890A GC system with an FID detector and a Chirasil-DEX-CB column
(Agilent; 25 m, 0.32 mm, 0.25 μm). Further chromatography details
can be found in section S3.2 in the Supporting
Information.

Yields of (R)-2 were
corrected for the initial concentration present in substrate 3 (15%). Due to limitations in the quantity of in-house synthesized 3, three colonies per plate were pooled together to test for
an increase in yield of (R)-2. Pooled
samples exhibiting an increased (R)-2 yield in comparison to wild-type KSI were rescreened individually,
as above, to identify the well(s) responsible for the improved yield.
Quantification was performed by comparing the peak areas to the calibration
curves of authentic standards. Vendor binary files were converted
to open mzXML data format42 using ProteoWizard
msConvert.43 Automated peak profiling and
quantification was conducted using in-house scripts written in R.

Comparative Activity of the Variants
First-generation
KSI variant hits and later mutants generated by site-specific mutagenesis
were cultured from glycerol stocks in LB medium containing 100 μg/mL
ampicillin as above. The KSI-encoding plasmids were extracted and
purified (Macherey-Nagel) and underwent Sanger sequencing to identify
the mutation present. Larger scale cultures (500 mL) were generated
for each variant in the same antibiotic-selective LB medium and incubated
at 37 °C (180 rpm) to an OD600nm value of 0.6–0.8,
followed by induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). Cultures were incubated overnight at 25 °C (180 rpm)
and the cells harvested by centrifugation (3000g for
5 min). Each variant underwent extraction (4 mL of lysis buffer) and
purification (0.5 mL Ni-NTA resin) using the same protocol and buffers
as in the initial screen (section S3.1 in
the Supporting Information). Biotransformations were performed with
1 mM 3 as above (10 μM KSI), and the variants that
did not display improved yield of (R)-2 above wild type (false positives) were discarded.

Steady-State
Reactions with (+)-cis-Isopulegone
Continuous
steady-state reactions with 3 were performed
with selected purified variants to investigate the effect of the mutation(s)
on the reaction rate. Reaction mixtures (100 μL) were composed
of 50 mM Tris pH 7.0 containing 1 mM 3 within UV-Star
microplates (Greiner Bio-One) and covered with a ClearVue sealing
sheet. Product formation was detected by monitoring the absorbance
at 260 nm for 1 h at 20 °C using a CLARIOstar microplate reader
(BMG Labtech). Concentrations were determined by comparison to a standard
curve (Figure S1), and data were corrected
for both 3 and (R)-2 loss
over 1 h (control substrate and product data).

Cascade Biocatalysis
The Mentha enzymes MpPGR and MMR
were produced (500 mL of culture; 20 °C)
and purified according to the method for the KSI variants (section S3.1 in the Supporting Information).
Reactions (200 μL) were performed in 50 mM Tris pH 7.0 containing
10 μM KSI, 1 μM MpPGR, 0.3 μM MMR, 1 mM 3, and a cofactor recycling system (10 U Sigma glucose dehydrogenase,
10 μM NADP+, and 15 mM d-glucose) to supply
MpPGR and MMR with NADPH.23 Reaction mixtures
were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h (180 rpm), and the extracts
were analyzed by GC-MS as before.

Pathway Assembly and in
Vitro Activity
The genes encoding
KSI variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S, MpPGR, and MMR and their respective
ribosomal binding sequences (RBS) were amplified by PCR and ligated
into pET21b using In-Fusion cloning to create an expression construct
under the control of one T7 promoter. The RBS of MMR was modified
by PCR mutagenesis to generate three constructs with lower predicted
translation initiation rates (Table S3).
Each construct was transformed into competent E. coli NEB5α cells and underwent culture growth, plasmid purification,
and DNA sequencing as before.

The plasmids were transformed
into competent E. coli NiCo21 (DE3)
expression cells and cultured on LB agar containing 100 μg/mL
ampicillin. Single colonies were selected and grown in 200 mL of phosphate
buffered Terrific Broth pH 7.0 containing 0.4% glycerol and 100 μg/mL
ampicillin, followed by induction with 0.1 mM IPTG. The cultures were
incubated overnight at 20 °C and harvested by centrifugation
(3000g). Soluble cell extracts were generated using
lysis buffer (3 mL pH 7.0), sonication, and centrifugation as above.
Cascade biocatalysis reactions were set up as before, except the purified
enzymes were replaced with 50 μL of cell extract.

Protein Crystallization
and Structure Solution
Purified
KSI variants D103S, V88I/L99V, V88I/L99V/D103S and V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S
(10 mg/mL) were crystallized using a Mosquito robot (TTP Labtech)
and the following crystallization solutions: (i) 10–25% PEG3350
with 0.2 M MgCl2, (ii) 10–25% PEG3350 with 0.2 M
ammonium acetate (pH 4.6), and (iii) 10–25% PEG3350 with 0.2
M ammonium acetate (pH 5.5). Crystals were flash-frozen in 30% glycerol
and data collected at the Diamond light source (beamlines IO4 and
IO3). Reflections were merged and scaled with Xia2.44 All mutant structures were solved by molecular replacement
using Phaser-MR (CCP4)45 and wild-type
KSI (PDB code: 1OPY) as a search model. Initial model building was done with AutoBuild
(PHENIX)46 followed by iterative cycles
of manual model building and refinement in COOT47 and Phenix.refine,48 respectively.
Mutations could be clearly identified in Fo – Fc difference maps and were
modeled accordingly. The final data collection and refinement statistics
are found in Table S4. The atomic coordinates
and structure factors (6F4Y, 6F50, 6F53, and 6F54) have been deposited
in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics,
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/).

Molecular Modeling
DFT modeling was performed using
Gaussian09 revision D.01.49 An active site
model was created from the crystal structure of KSI with bound androstenedione
(6; PDB ID 1OHS) including the side chains and α-carbons of
the 15 first-shell residues shown in Figure S4, with substrate 3 built in using the coordinates of
the corresponding ligand 6 atoms as the starting point.
Energy minimization was carried out using the B3LYP hybrid functional
and 6-31G(d) basis sets50 with the D3 version
of Grimme’s dispersion.51 Since
the active site is solvent exposed, a continuum solvent model was
used to mimic the shielding effect of water. Molecular dynamics simulations
were carried out using Gromacs 4.6.1 with the Gromos 53A6 force field
and periodic boundary conditions.52,53 For WT KSI,
the crystal structure of KSI with bound 6 (PDB: 1OHS) was used, with
substrate 3 built in using the coordinates of the corresponding
ligand 6 atoms as the starting point. For KSI variant
V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S, ligand 3 was placed in the active
site of the crystal structure (PDB: 1OPY) by aligning the protein to the wild-type
KSI model. The energy minimization parameters are described in detail
in section S6 in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Identification of KSI as a (+)-cis-Isopulegone
Isomerase
Prior studies with the partially purified native M. piperita isomerase suggested its mechanism resembled
that of the bacterial Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase family (EC
5.3.3.1).26 These enzymes catalyze the
isomerization of Δ5-3-ketosteroids, such as 5(10)estrene-3,17-dione,
to the equivalent Δ4-3-ketosteroid by intramolecular transfer
of the C4β proton to the C6β position.54 Prior studies showed that KSI from P. putida reacts with the truncated substrate 3-cyclohexen-1-one, forming
the more stable 2-cyclohexen-1-one.55 Therefore,
we postulated that KSI might react with the structurally related compound 3 to generate (R)-2 using a
similar mechanism (Scheme 1B).

A C-terminally His6-tagged version of
wild-type KSI from P. putida was generated,
and biotransformations with 3 showed that 2 was formed (35% yield). Chiral GC analysis confirmed that the product
generated was (R)-2, the enantiomeric
form required for 1 biosynthesis (Table S5).2 An additional minor
quantity (<1% yield) of the side product (−)-trans-isopulegone (7) was also detected. As the (R)-2 yields were judged to be too low for biotechnological
applications, we employed a directed evolution strategy to engineer
KSI for improved synthesis of (R)-2.

Automated Directed Evolution of KSI
Comparative studies
of KSI with single- and multiple-ring substrates showed that, while
the specificity (kcat/Km) is 27000-fold higher for steroid substrates, the reaction
rates were within 2-fold.55 This suggests
that remote binding interactions with steroid substrates have a marked
effect on the strength of substrate binding, and single-ring substrates
such as 3 may have poor binding affinity. Therefore,
our initial KSI mutagenesis strategy was to increase binding of 3 by targeting every amino acid known or predicted to interact
with steroid substrates. An examination of the cocrystal structure
of wild-type KSI bound to the reaction intermediate analogue equilenin
(PDB 1OH0)34 showed that 16 residues were located within
5 Å of the ligand. Given the overall apolar nature of the KSI
active site and 3, maintaining this environment would
likely maximize our search for optimized mutations while minimizing
the size of the variant libraries and subsequent screening effort.
Reducing the number of screening assays was critical, given the limited
availability of the in-house-synthesized substrate 3.

Twelve of these residues were targeted for individual limited randomizing
mutagenesis, where the general physicochemical properties of the amino
acids were conserved (Table S1). Residues
Y16 and Y57 are both known to partake in H bonding with the substrate
carbonyl moiety; therefore, these residues were mutated combinatorially,
using an ambiguous codon (WVC) that encodes other residues capable
of H bonding. Similarly, residues V88 and L99 were selected for combinatorial
mutations using an ambiguous codon (DTK) for hydrophobic residues,
given their close proximity to the substrate analogue.34 Variant sequences were created by gene synthesis
using ambiguous codons (Table S2) and constructed
using the SpeedyGenes protocols.37,38 In total,
158 variants were created and screened for improvement in (R)-2 production using automated robotic culturing
and protein purification protocols (summarized in Figure S2). Comparative biotransformations were performed
with 3, with quantitation and product identification
by GC-MS, to identify variants with activity higher than that of wild-type
KSI.

Four enzyme variants were identified as having minor increases
in (R)-2 yield (1.4–1.7 fold),
three of which contained mutations of residue L99 (L99I, L99V, and
V88I/L99V; Table 1).
Interestingly, both L99I and L99V involve mutations to a smaller side
chain, suggesting that these changes may affect 3 binding
by reducing steric hindrance. The fourth improved variant D103S also
contained a smaller side chain; however, there was also a change from
a negatively charged moiety to a polar functionality. As a serine
hydroxyl group can participate in H bonding, this mutation might maintain
the native enzyme hydrogen-bonding interaction with the substrate
carbonyl group.

Second Round: Compiling
Mutations
To investigate the
combinatorial effect of the initial screen variants, the L99X-containing
single and double mutants were each combined with D103S using asymmetric
PCR mutagenesis.39,40 Each variant was purified and
underwent biotransformations to determine any improvement in (R)-2 yield by GC-MS (Table 1). Unfortunately, these double and triple
variants showed only moderate improvements in (R)-2 yield in comparison to wild-type enzyme (1.8–1.9-fold).

Third Round: Structure-Guided Mutation
To ensure the
mutations in the active site and surrounding residues did not affect
the overall fold of KSI, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of
the four key variants D103S, V88I/L99V, V88I/L99V/D103S, and V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S
(Table S4). Each of these structures showed
backbone conformations virtually identical with the cocrystal structure
of wild-type KSI bound to the reaction intermediate analogue equilenin
(Figure S3),34 with RMSD values of 0.427, 0.418, 0.443, and 0.357, respectively.
All of the mutations could be clearly identified in Fo – Fc difference maps
and were incorporated without any major displacement of the backbone
atoms or surrounding residues. We did note minor rearrangements of
backbone atoms within the loop region 90–98 (results not shown).
This loop is exposed to the bulk solvent and shows above average B factors in comparison to surrounding residues, implying
the observed differences are due to inherent flexibility, rather than
any mutational changes to neighboring residues.

Inspecting the
spatial arrangement of these mutations showed that residue V101 was
positioned directly between L99V and D103S, highlighting it as another
potential target for mutagenesis (Figure 1B, inset). Given that most of the existing
variants resulted in a shortening of the amino acid side chain, the
triple variant was modified to incorporate the mutation V101A. Biotransformations
were performed on the KSI V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S variant, which showed
a more dramatic increase in (R)-2 production
over wild-type enzyme (4.5-fold; Table 1). Therefore, the modification of V101 to an alanine
residue has resulted in over a 2-fold increase in (R)-2 formation over the triple variant.

the variant residues in KSI V881/L99V/D103S. The backbone and mutations
are shown as gray ribbons and balls, respectively (blue balls for

To investigate the effect of the
mutations further, the specific
activity of the variants with substrate 3 was determined
under pseudo-steady-state conditions (1 h reactions). This method
takes advantage of the enolization of 3 to (R)-2, which results in the development of a peak around
260 nm (Figure S1). First-generation variants
showed minor rate increases (around 1.3-fold), while a near 2-fold
improvement was seen with the triple variant V88I/L99V/D103S (Figure 1B). The addition
of mutation V101A generated a 4.3-fold increase in specific activity
in comparison to the WT (61.17 μmol/(min mg) in comparison to
14.16 μmol/(min mg); Figure 1B). Therefore, the increases in the overall reaction
rate mirror the increased product yields detected in the 24 h biotransformations.

Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations for KSI Variants
We performed comparative DFT modeling and MD simulations between
wild-type KSI and variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S to investigate the
origin(s) of activity rate changes. The DFT optimized model for wild
type KSI suggests that the substrate 3 carbonyl group
hydrogen bonds with D103 (<2.0 Å), but the orientation is
nonideal for catalysis due to a less favorable interaction distance
for the proton abstraction step (Figure 2, Figure S4, and Scheme 1B). Additionally,
residue L99 has reoriented outward from the active site, causing a
twist in the β-hairpin from residue 88 to 99 (Figure S2).

variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S modeled with 3 in the active
site. The solvent-accessible surface areas for the substrate and residues
88, 99, and 101 from the representative and minimized structures,
respectively, are shown as transparent surfaces. The dotted lines
illustrate potential steric clashes between the substrate and enzyme.
The MD simulations were performed using Gaussian09 revision D.01.49

MD simulations of variant KSI with 3 restrained
in
a reactive conformation suggests that the decrease in bulk of variant
residues I88, V99, and A101 allows the substrate to comfortably adopt
this position (Figure 2B). The position of 3 looks more ideal, with a D40–substrate
hydrogen–oxygen distance of 2.04 Å in the DFT model. Therefore,
the decrease in bulk of variant residues I88, V99, and A101 has allowed
this reorienting of the substrate, while still maintaining a (slightly
longer) hydrogen-bonding interaction with residue S103 (D103 in wild
type). MD simulations with the variant model showed no repositioning
of the hairpin loop from 88 to 99 was necessary, as 3 fit more easily within the active site. Overall, molecular simulations
suggest that these four mutations have improved binding of 3 in a functional conformation within the active site. Therefore,
the V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S variant was selected for further studies
to see if it can be used in cascade reactions for the biosynthetic
production of 1 from 3.

One-pot (−)-Menthol
Production with Purified Enzymes
Initial cascade reactions
were performed with purified enzymes
to eliminate any interference from competing E. coli enzymes present in whole cells and cell extracts (Table 2). Interestingly, reactions
with KSI variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S showed the formation of ∼10%
byproducts, such as trans-isopulegone (7). This suggests that the presence of the four mutations has altered
the range of possible binding conformations of 3, leading
to additional isomer formation. The pathway from 3 to 1 also requires the presence of two Mentha enzymes, namely pulegone reductase (MpPGR)29 and (−)-menthone:(−)-menthol reductase (MMR), to generate
(−)-menthone (8) and 1, respectively
(Scheme 1A).2 Initial biocatalytic reactions of purified MpPGR
with (R)-2 showed it produced near-equivalent
yields of 8 and (+)-isomenthone (9) (ratio
49:51; Table 2). This
differs slightly from previous studies of a non-His6-tagged
recombinant form of MpPGR, which showed an 8:9 ratio of 55:45.29 However, this enzyme
showed a significantly higher yield of 8 than had been
seen with the homologous enzyme from Nicotiana tabacum (NtDBR) performed under the same reaction conditions.56 Similarly, purified MMR-His6 demonstrated
activity toward 8 similar to that in previous studies,5 showing primarily 1 production (Table 2).

a Duplicate reactions
(200 μL)
were performed in 50 mM Tris pH 7.0 containing 1 mM monoterpenoid
substrate, enzyme(s), and cofactor recycling system (10 U Sigma glucose
dehydrogenase, 10 μM NADP+, and 15 mM d-glucose).
After a 24 h incubation at 30 °C (180 rpm), reaction mixtures
were extracted with 180 μL of ethyl acetate containing 0.01% sec-butylbenzene and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. Products were analyzed by GC-MS using a DB-WAX column (Figure S7). Reaction mixtures with individual
enzymes had enzyme concentrations of 10 μM. The in vitro cascading
reaction had enzyme concentrations of 10, 2, and 0.3 μM for
KSI variant, MpPGR, and MMR, respectively. Control biotransformations
of each compound in the absence of enzymes (data not shown) showed
losses occurred over 24 h due to nonenzymatic degradation. Therefore,
the product yields are likely an underestimation of the true yields.
The cell extract and whole cell slurry volumes in the cascading reactions
were 50 μL. Substrates are shown in boldface. N/A = not applicable.

b KSI variant = V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S.

c Additional products were detected
that were not quantified (e.g., 7 and (+)-neoiso-isopulegol
(10)).

Initial
cascade biocatalytic reactions of purified KSI wild-type
and variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S with MpPGR and MMR with 3 showed that the major product was an isomer of isopulegol (results
not shown). Chiral GC analysis of the reaction mixture showed that
the main isomer formed was (+)-neoiso-isopulegol (10),
with a minor proportion of (−)-isopulegol generated (Figure S6).57 However,
product 1 was also detected, with 5.1-fold higher yields
obtained for reactions containing V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S variant KSI
(46 μM vs 9 μM).

Subsequent reactions with each
individually purified biocatalyst
showed that this side product was obtained by the action of MMR on 3, which differs from earlier studies.5 However, this apparent disparity is likely due to the 144-fold reduction
in the reaction time of the earlier study in comparison to this work
(6–9 min vs 24 h).5 It is likely
that the mechanism of action of MMR with 3 proceeds in
a manner similar to that for the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase
(SDR) ketoreduction mechanism described previously for MMR and MNMR
with substrates 8 and 9 (Scheme 2).58 Unfortunately, the formation of 10 by MMR appeared
to dominate over the reaction with 8, likely due to the
lack of the latter substrate at the start of the reaction.

Scheme 2 Proposed
Mechanism of Action of the NADPH-Dependent MMR-Catalyzed
Reduction of 3 to 10
This is adapted from the proposed
SDR ketoreductase mechanism of MNMR with 8.58

Subsequent cascade reactions
were performed with a 30-fold molar
excess of KSI over MMR, to allow KSI activity with 3 to
predominate. Using this approach, we dramatically increased 1 titers (63.4 μM; 14.1% conversion; Table 2) relative to 10, producing a near 1:1 ratio of products. In addition, a surprising
yet advantageous observation was that relatively lower levels of 9 (and subsequently 5) than expected were produced
for MMR, with a combined ratio of 76:24 ((8 + 1):(9 + 5)). Therefore, these studies have
demonstrated that KSI variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S can be utilized
in cascade reactions as the first step in generating 1 from 3.

Cascading Production of 3 Using
Cell-Free Extracts
and Whole Cells
We have previously reported the biosynthesis
of menthol isomers from (R)-2, using E. coli cell extracts expressing the enzymes NtDBR
and MMR.23 To further extend this approach,
we developed a single expression construct in pET21b containing KSI
variant V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S, MpPGR, and MMR, with each gene under
the control of one T7 promoter (Table S3). This enabled the IPTG-dependent coexpression of all three genes
in E. coli. Biotransformations were
performed using cell extracts with 3 in the presence
of a cofactor recycling system, the latter to supply MpPGR and MMR
with NADPH. As expected, the major product obtained was 10, due to the promiscuous activity of MMR (results not shown).

To mimic the effect of increasing the KSI:MMR concentration ratio in vivo, we modified the RBS sequence upstream of MMR to
three alternative ones, each with predicted translation initiation
rates (TIR) less than the existing rate of 4100 (1000, 500, and 200; Table S3).59,60 Of the three constructs,
only that containing an RBS with a predicted TIR of 500 showed any
MMR activity, leading to the production of both 1 and 10 (Table 2). Cell extracts of this construct yielded 53 μM of 1, similar to that obtained with the purified enzyme one-pot biocatalytic
reactions. The higher levels of 8 and 9 detected
reflects the lower in vivo concentration of MMR within this construct.
Reactions were also conducted with whole cells, producing nearly 3-fold
higher levels of 1 in comparison to cell extract biotransformations
(159 μM, 27% total yield; Table 2) with proportionally less 10.

These
studies have demonstrated that these three enzymes have great
potential in an overall strategy for in vivo production of 1 in E. coli. Ideally KSI V88I/L99V/V101A/D103S
would be incorporated into an E. coli construct containing all the remaining enzymes required for 1 production from (S)-4 (Scheme 1A). This would enable
one-pot biotransformations or in vivo fermentations to be performed
using the inexpensive and renewable starting material (S)-4. Ultimately, the inclusion of an (S)-4 production pathway would enable E.
coli to produce 1 in vivo from simple
sugars.61 This would avoid the addition
of high concentrations of toxic monoterpenoid precursors and eliminate
the need for exogenous cofactor recycling systems. Additionally, the
low in vivo concentration of 3 would likely minimize
pathway hijacking to form 10, increasing the overall
yields of 1.

Concluding Remarks
The implementation of a synthetic biology approach to microbial 1 production has been hampered by the absence of the sequence
for the native Mentha pathway enzyme
IPGI and the lack of identification of plant proteins exhibiting homology
to bacterial Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerases known to catalyze this
reaction on steroid substrates. We took the approach of engineering
an existing bacterial Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase to improve
its activity toward 3, using a structure-modeling-guided,
semirational design to identify target residues. Our implementation
of a robotics platform to ensure rapid and reproducible automated
gene assembly, enzyme purification, and microscale biotransformation
screening enabled the identification of potential variant biocatalysts
with limited substrate availability. The incorporation of four targeted
mutations into KSI enabled a 4.3-fold increase in IPGI activity, generating
a biotechnologically useful enzyme with significant in vivo activity.
Further engineering studies could potentially improve its functionality,
thereby driving the cascade reactions toward more efficient 1 production.

This is the first report of a non-Mentha enzyme with IPGI activity, thereby identifying
the “missing
link” to complete the enzymatic route from (S)-4 to 1. This will enable for the first
time the full construction of a biosynthetic pathway for microbial
production of 1. The demonstration of successful 1 production from 3 by engineered E. coli adds to a growing number of studies highlighting
the potential usefulness of microbial hosts in monoterpenoid production.
It is anticipated that integrating our existing KSI-MpPGR-MMR construct
into a larger chassis will enable the production of menthol isomers
from inexpensive precursors, providing a sustainable and renewable
production platform to meet the growing global demand for natural
menthol products.
