The chemoselective functionalization
of polyfunctional aryl linchpins
is crucial for rapid diversification. Although well-explored for Csp2 and Csp nucleophiles, the chemoselective
introduction of Csp3 groups remains notoriously
difficult and is virtually undocumented using Ni catalysts. To fill
this methodological gap, a “haloselective” cross-coupling
process of arenes bearing two halogens, I and Br, using ammonium alkylbis(catecholato)silicates,
has been developed. Utilizing Ni/photoredox dual catalysis, Csp3–Csp2 bonds can
be forged selectively at the iodine-bearing carbon of bromo(iodo)arenes.
The described high-yielding, base-free strategy accommodates various
protic functional groups. Selective electrophile activation enables
installation of a second Csp3 center and can
be done without the need for purification of the intermediate monoalkylated
product.

Chemoselective processes facilitate
rapid divergence in organic synthesis.1 Innate chemical discrimination stemming from myriad factors is often
the crux not only of elegant synthetic chemistry but of nature’s
precise manipulation of the chemical world. Whereas nature relies
on enzymes to effect chemoselective transformations, synthetic chemists
increasingly rely on transition metal catalysts to enhance structural
complexity selectively and efficiently.2 Indeed, great strides have been made recently, particularly in chemoselective
C–C cross-coupling.3 In this context,
approaches include selective oxidative addition via differences in
C–X bond enthalpies, exploiting the disparate transmetalation
rates of nucleophiles, and mechanistic discrimination.3

Although seemingly well-developed in the area of
Csp2–Csp2 cross-coupling,
the ability
to forge Csp3–Csp2 bonds when using bromo(iodo)aryl compounds in a “haloselective”
manner remains challenging. The recalcitrance of bench-stable Csp3 nucleophiles (e.g., organoboron or organostannyl
species) toward Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling requires laborious, harsh methods to be employed.4 As such, chemoselective cross-coupling is inherently
intractable using these reagents. Alternatively, more reactive nucleophiles
(e.g., organozinc species) have been used sporadically with success
for chemoselective functionalization via Pd-mediated cross-coupling,
although no cohesive study has been performed on this topic.5 Moreover, analogous Ni-mediated processes are
virtually undocumented in the literature. More often than not, a multistep
approach is used to install the desired alkyl group wherein selectivity
is achieved via Csp2–Csp2 or Csp2–Csp cross-coupling
(i.e., using Pd-based catalysts) followed by a functional group interconversion
(i.e., reduction to an alkane; see Figure 1).6 Although reliable,
these multistep processes are inherently less direct and efficient
than the former approaches, particularly if installation of an additional
Csp3 center is desired. Thus, no general solution
for Csp3–Csp2 coupling
using bromo(iodo)arenes in a haloselective manner has been reported,
despite the fact that such transformations would allow access to useful
linchpins for polyfunctional arene construction.

Figure 1 Current strategies versus
the envisioned approach for selective
electrophilic activation of bromo(iodo)aryl linchpins.

The recent emergence of Ni/photoredox dual catalysis
has resulted
in a rapid, one-step approach to install alkyl groups and represents
an alternative to the two classical Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling extremes (i.e., reactive nucleophiles
or harsh conditions).7,8 In this dual catalytic manifold,
a benchtop-stable Csp3 pro-nucleophile is controllably
activated by photocatalyst-mediated, single-electron transfer (SET)
oxidation to generate the active nucleophile, an alkyl radical. Ultimately,
this catalytic system endows chemists with a platform that enables
facile, mild Csp3–Csp2 bond formation with the added benefit of broad tolerance toward
sensitive moieties. Moreover, numerous feedstocks for pro-nucleophiles
have been identified, such as organotrifluoroborates,9a,9b carboxylic acids,9c,9d alkylbis(catecholato)silicates,9e−9g 4-alkyl-1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs),9h,9i and even activated
C–H bonds.9j−9l Consequently, substantial structural diversity in
the nucleophilic partner can be readily accessed. Because of the mild
conditions and the generally less electron-rich ligands employed,
Ni/photoredox dual catalysis presents a broadly applicable solution
to the challenge of chemoselective cross-coupling in the bromo(iodo)arene
scaffold. Given the improved clinical success of drug molecules possessing
higher fractions of Csp3 centers,10 the realization of such a solution would enable
the modular synthesis of polyfunctional arenes via the controlled
functionalization of each synthetic handle and access to molecules
with higher 3D complexity.

To investigate the tenability of
this strategy, ammonium alkylbis(catecholato)silicates
were utilized as “plug and play” radical progenitors.9e,9f This choice was made for a number of reasons: (1) the ability to
perform dual catalytic cross-coupling free of any additives (thus
maximizing functional group tolerance and minimizing complications
arising from additives), (2) the amenability to generating stabilized
and destabilized radicals (thus allowing assessment of broad applicability),
and (3) the known ease with which these hypercoordinate silicon species
can be used in cross-coupling with an array of electrophiles (thus
assessing electrophile fidelity). Additionally, the low redox potential
(E0 ∼ 0.40–0.75 V vs SCE)
of ammonium alkylbis(catecholato)silicates and their tunable solubility
properties (based on counterion structure) allow flexibility in the
identity of the photocatalyst and solvent, respectively.9e,9f Ultimately, haloselective cross-coupling was envisioned to occur
via the mechanism shown in Scheme 1.11 Speculatively, selective
oxidative addition by the NiI species II would
provide discrimination between the iodine and bromine.12−14

Scheme 1 Envisioned Catalytic Cycle for Selective Cross-Coupling of Dihaloarenes
Using Ni/Photoredox Dual Catalysis
Using the previously optimized conditions for Ni/photoredox
dual
catalytic cross-coupling of alkylsilicates,9e a baseline for innate selectivity and conversion was observed to
be 88:12 (3a:4a) at 95% conversion (Table 1, entry 1). Without
any optimization, selective functionalization was possible with no
detectable overalkylation. However, improvement of the selectivity
was still needed. Given that selectivity might hinge on kinetic control
of oxidative addition, ligand choice and Ni catalyst loading were
examined. When using dtbbpy, Ni loading seemed to have a minimal effect,
although lower loadings appeared to be preferable (entries 1–3).
Next, a number of bipyridyl and phenanthryl ligands were examined.
These two ligand classes have been shown to be privileged in the context
of Ni/photoredox dual catalysis but are virtually undocumented in
facilitating this type of selective alkyl–aryl coupling. Although
substituted bipyridyl ligands failed to improve the ratio (entries
4 and 5), bipyridine itself gave excellent selectivity (entry 6).
Selectivity did come at the cost of lowered conversion. Similarly,
phenanthroline performed well (entry 9), whereas alteration of the
substitution pattern of the phenanthryl core had deleterious effects
on conversion (entry 7) or selectivity (entry 8). Using a lower Ni
loading, a 2:1 ligand to metal ratio, and slightly increasing the
loading of the photocatalyst resulted in excellent conversion and
selectivity (entries 10 and 11). Ultimately, both protocols were scaled
up and gave good yields of the desired cross-coupled product. Conceivably,
these ligand systems are not as efficient at oxidative addition as
dtbbpy from either NiI (or Ni0) and thus provide
further chemoselective enhancement from innate I/Br selectivity.15

Table 1 Optimization of Haloselective
Cross-Couplinga
a Unless otherwise noted, reactions
were run using 0.1 mmol of 1a for 16 h at 27 °C
and using a 1:1 Ni/ligand ratio.

b Conversions and ratios of 3a to 4a were
determined by GC/MS and confirmed
by 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

c Values in parentheses indicate the
isolated yields on a 0.5 mmol scale of 1a.

d A 1:2 Ni/ligand ratio and 2.5 mol
% of Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 were used.

With suitable conditions and two
viable ligands identified, we
next investigated the scope of the process (Table 2). First, the range of bromo(iodo)arenes
that could be used was assessed using a representative 1° alkylsilicate, 2a. The reaction proved quite general, accommodating a number
of functional groups and giving excellent chemoselectivity in nearly
all cases (Table 2).
Although in general phen was primarily used, bpy could be used interchangeably
with little to no effect on yield or selectivity. Unsubstituted bromo(iodo)arenes
underwent haloselective cross-coupling in good yield regardless of
the substitution pattern of the two halides (3a–c). In addition, scale up of this process proved facile and
did not compromise selectivity. Both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups were well-tolerated. Aryl substitution did appear to impact
the efficiency and/or selectivity of the described cross-coupling
process, with both steric and electronic changes having subtle yet
noticeable effects on either product ratio or yield. Indeed, the substrates
derived from 2-bromo-4-iodophenol (3h–3k), as well as 3t, best illustrate these sorts of effects.
Of note are the polyfunctional arenes 3f, 3j, and 3k, which, in addition to the bromide handle,
possess a third site for additional functionalization. We serendipitously
discovered that when attempting to isolate 3f, a minor
change in the order of the workup (base wash prior to acid wash) led
to the facile hydrolysis of the acetoxy group. Thus, the free alcohol, 3f′, could also be obtained under near identical reaction
conditions. Heteroaromatics generally proved challenging or low yielding
in the described cross-coupling process (possibly because of competitive
ligation, poor catalyst efficiency, or catalyst deactivation), although
some success was observed with a quinoline-based system (3p). Finally, although a benzylic alcohol failed under the optimized
conditions, TBS-protection restored reactivity (3s) and
enabled successful cross-coupling, albeit with somewhat diminished
chemoselectivity.

Table 2 Selective Cross-Coupling Using Alkylsilicate 2aa
a Unless otherwise noted, reactions
were performed using 1 (1.0 equiv, 0.5 mmol), 2a (1.2 equiv), NiCl2·dme (2.5 mol %), Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 (2 mol %), and phen (5 mol %)
in DMF (0.1 M) at rt for 24 h, irradiating with blue LEDs; ratios
of 3:4 are indicated in parentheses, and
these values were obtained before purification. All yields are isolated
yields after purification.

b Performed using bpy as a ligand.

c Value in brackets denotes the yield
on a 5 mmol scale using phen as the ligand.

d Product obtained as its 1°
alcohol rather than acetate by modification of the workup.

The diversity in radical structure
was next assessed (Table 3). Gratifyingly, a
variety of alkylsilicates were successfully employed without compromising
yield or chemoselectivity. Relatively simple 1° and 2° alkylsilicates
performed well in the haloselective cross-coupling process. In addition,
the organic dye 4CzIPN could be used in place of the Ru-based photocatalyst
at a minimal cost of selectivity and yield (see 3z).
Nucleophilic partners that would be typically unattainable as their
corresponding organometallics did not pose a problem in this process
(3aa–ae, 3ag, 3ah). The reaction is highly tolerant of protic functional
groups, a unique aspect of this process that cannot be mimicked with
current protocols in haloselective Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling (e.g., 3ab–ad, 3ae). Notably, the thiolsilicate, used in
the synthesis of 3ad, undergoes hydrogen atom transfer
(HAT) upon radical generation to furnish a thiyl radical that subsequently
couples, as disclosed in our previous report.16 Thus, 3ad was obtained as the corresponding thioether.
Not only was this successful, but it also demonstrated that S-centered radicals are also amenable to selective coupling.
Finally, stabilized radicals performed quite well in the haloselective
cross-coupling (3ah–ai), despite
the known reversibility of radical metalation.11

Table 3 Selective Cross-Coupling of 1e with Various Alkylsilicatesa
a Unless otherwise noted, reactions
were performed using 1e (1.0 equiv, 0.5 mmol), 2 (1.2 equiv), NiCl2·dme (2.5 mol %), Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 (2 mol %), and phen (5 mol %)
in DMF (0.1 M) at rt for 24 h, irradiating with blue LEDs; ratios
of 3:4 are indicated in parentheses, and
these values were obtained before purification. All yields are isolated
yields after purification.

b Value in brackets denotes the yield
when using the organic dye 4CzIPN (5 mol %) as the photocatalyst.

c Product obtained as the thioether
rather than thiol from (3-mercaptopropyl)silicate.

To showcase the utility of the described
haloselective process
further, a series of subsequent functionalization reactions were executed
using 3aj (Figure 2). In addition to demonstrating the value of the haloselective
process, the requisite amount of 3aj for these studies
presented the opportunity to push the limits of the scalability of
this cross-coupling reaction. The reaction proved to be quite scalable
and can be performed on 10 mmol scale (and likely greater) with minimal
effect on yield and chemoselectivity. Subsequent installation of Csp2 or Csp centers via Suzuki or Sonogashira
coupling processes, respectively, proceeded very smoothly, affording
good yields of the corresponding cross-coupled products. Buchwald–Hartwig-type
amination similarly was successful, affording the piperidinyl adduct 6aj in 74% yield. Finally, installation of a second Csp3 center via a second Ni/photoredox cross-coupling
of an alkylsilicate was successful, giving 8aj in 51%
yield. This process was later repeated starting from 1b without intermediate isolation, providing an improved 66% yield
of the desired product.

Figure 2 Diversification
of 3aj. Conditions: (a) 3aj (0.5 mmol,
1 equiv), TMS-acetylene (3 equiv), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (5 mol %), CuI (5 mol %), Et3N (0.2 M),
80 °C, 48 h; (b) 3aj (1 mmol, 1 equiv),
piperidine (1.5 equiv), XPhos G2 (2 mol %), Cs2CO3 (2.5 equiv), toluene/t-BuOH (5:1, 0.4 M), 80 °C,
18 h; (c) 3aj (0.5 mmol, 1 equiv), organotrifluoroborate
(1.5 equiv), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (5 mol
%), Cs2CO3 (3 equiv), THF/H2O (2:1,
0.25 M), 80 °C, 18 h; (d) 3aj (1 mmol, 1 equiv),
alkylsilicate (1.2 equiv), [Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 (5 mol %), and Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 (2 mol %), DMF (0.1 M), blue LEDs, rt, 24 h. (e) The
yield in parentheses indicates the yield of sequential coupling, starting
from 1b on 0.5 mmol scale without isolation of 3aj.

Recognizing the power
of this method for selective electrophile
activation and to build on our successful sequential process with 8aj, a series of tandem Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling reactions were successfully attempted
(Figure 3). Using the
now-established conditions for the haloselective process, the first
alkyl group was installed at the iodo position in three distinct bromo(iodo)arenes.
After a simple aqueous workup, the crude product was subjected to
the standard conditions for Ni/photoredox dual catalytic cross-coupling,
thus installing a second alkyl group at the bromo position.9e,9f This demonstrates the ability of this process to install alkyl groups
regioselectively (compare 3ak to 3am) and
further validates the selective electrophile-activation paradigm.
In addition, the overall yields were quite good, equating to greater
than 75% per chemical step for all four examples.

Figure 3 Tandem Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling. Numbers
in parentheses are ratios of 3:4 after the
first coupling. Conditions: (a) 1 (1.0 equiv, 0.5 mmol),
alkylsilicate (1.2 equiv), NiCl2·dme (2.5 mol %),
Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 (2 mol %), and phen
(5 mol %) DMF (0.1 M), blue LEDs, rt, 24 h;
(b) alkylsilicate (1.2 equiv), [Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 (5 mol %), and Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 (2 mol %), DMF (0.1 M), blue LEDs, rt, 24 h.

In summary, a mild, user-friendly
method for the selective electrophilic
activation of bromo(iodo)arenes using ammonium alkylbis(catecholato)silicates
is presented. The described “haloselective” reaction
tolerates an array of functional groups, including those bearing acidic
protons, and is highly scalable. The monofunctionalized products can
be readily paired with existing cross-coupling technology, affording
a means to fuse classical two-electron cross-coupling with single-electron
transformations. Sequential Ni/photoredox cross-coupling of these
polyfunctional arenes enables two unique Csp3–Csp2 bonds to be forged selectively.
The conditions outlined here can likely be extended to other radical
progenitors, further emphasizing the utility of the described process
for rapid diversification.

Although using phosphine
complexes of Ni rather than the bipyrdyl or phenanthryl ligands used
here, Kochi has suggested that oxidative addition may proceed via
a SET from Ni0 when iodides are used. See the following: Tsou T. T. ; Kochi J. K.

Very recently, Schoenebeck
and the groups
of Sproules and Nelson have engaged in mechanistic studies on oxidative
addition via a NiI species. Although the Nelson report
expands on the work of Kochi in ref (12), Schoenebeck suggests a NiI oxidative
addition with bpy ligands in the context of aryl trifluoromethylthiolation.

A single example
of the Ni/photoredox
cross-coupling of 4-bromoiodobenzene with a benzyl radical derived
from a DHP was reported; see ref (9i).


Computational investigations of
this innate selectivity are ongoing within our laboratory to explain
this peculiar ligand effect further, as well as further understand
how Ni oxidation states influence oxidative addition rates.
