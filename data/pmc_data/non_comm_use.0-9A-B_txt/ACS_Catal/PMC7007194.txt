Lytic polysaccharide
monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent
enzymes for the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides such as
chitin and cellulose. Unlike classical hydrolytic enzymes (cellulases),
LPMOs catalyze the cleavage of the glycosidic bond via an oxidative
mechanism using oxygen and a reductant. The full enzymatic molecular
mechanisms, starting from the initial electron transfer from a reductant
to oxygen activation and hydrogen peroxide formation, are not yet
understood. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics
simulations, we have uncovered the oxygen activation mechanisms by
LPMO in the presence of ascorbic acid, one of the most-used reductants
in LPMOs assays. Our simulations capture the sequential formation
of Cu(II)-O2– and Cu(II)-OOH– intermediates via facile H atom abstraction from ascorbate. By investigating
all the possible reaction pathways from the Cu(II)–OOH– intermediate, we ruled out Cu(II)-O• – formation via direct O–O cleavage of Cu(II)-OOH–. Meanwhile, we identified a possible pathway in which the proximal
O atom of Cu(II)–OOH– abstracts a hydrogen
atom from ascorbate, leading to Cu(I) and H2O2. The in-situ-generated H2O2 either converts
to LPMO-Cu(II)-O• – via a homolytic
reaction, or diffuses into the bulk water in an uncoupled pathway.
The competition of these two pathways is strongly dependent on the
binding of the carbohydrate substrate, which plays a role in barricading
the in-situ-generated H2O2 molecule, preventing
its diffusion from the active site into the bulk water. Based on the
present results, we propose a catalytic cycle of LPMOs that is consistent
with the experimental information available. In particular, it explains
the enigmatic substrate dependence of the reactivity of the LPMO with
H2O2.

Introduction
Lytic polysaccharide
monooxygenases (LPMOs) are regarded as the
key enzymes for the degradation of polysaccharides such as chitin
and cellulose,1−16 being of high commercial interest in the production of biofuels.
These enzymes activate glycosidic bonds through hydroxylation of the
polysaccharide substrate at either the C1 or the C4 position, followed
by the elimination of the scissile glycosidic bond and formation of
the aldonic acids (Figure 1a) or 4-keto sugars at oxidized chain ends, respectively.1−19

polysaccharide substrate bound on the surface of the enzyme (PDB code: 5ACF). The right-side
panel highlights the active site structure. Note that His1 is an Nδ-methylated histidine (hereafter named Hic1) that is
coordinated to the metal ion via both its imidazole Nε and its amino terminus NH2.

As shown in Figure 1b, the LPMO active site contains a mononuclear copper center
ligated
by two histidine ligands (His1 and His78), an arrangement known as
the histidine brace.15Figure 1a describes the general reaction
catalyzed by LPMOs, in which two electrons are required to activate
molecular oxygen toward the oxidative cleavage of polysaccharides.
These two electrons are either externally supplied by small molecule
reductants,2−8,20 or enzymatic electron donors
such as cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH).21 In most experiments, ascorbic acid has been used as an efficient
electron donor for LPMOs.2,4−8,20 Recent studies have shown that
these enzymes may also use H2O2 as a co-substrate.22−24 This finding is linked to the observation that LPMOs can generate
H2O2 from uncoupled turnover when exposed to
O2 and a reducing agent in the absence of a substrate.20,25,26

Despite extensive experimental
and computational studies, the molecular
mechanism of LPMOs remains elusive, and sometimes even controversial.16−19Scheme 1 shows the
putative catalytic pathways for the O2-dependent activity
of LPMOs that emerge from experimental and computational investigations.
It is generally accepted that the catalytic cycle is entered via the
one-electron reduction of the Cu(II) resting state to Cu(I), followed
by O2 binding to generate a Cu(II)-superoxo species, Cu(II)-O2–.16−19,27 Early theoretical calculations4 on small active site models suggested that O2 binds in the axial coordination position, trans to the Tyr164 residue (see Figure 1b). However, a combined spectroscopic and computational
study,28 as well as QM/MM calculations29 have shown that the equatorial coordination
is energetically more favorable. This is consistent with the recently
determined crystal structure of a LPMO (CAZy classification AA9),30 in which the polysaccharide substrate occupies
the space around the axial position (Figure 1b), leaving only the equatorial site (occupied
by a chloride exogenous ligand in the structure) for co-substrate
binding.

Scheme 1 Possible Catalytic Pathways for the Polysaccharide Substrate
Hydroxylation
via the O2-Dependent Activity of LPMOs
The Cu(II)-O2– species
formed upon
O2 binding was initially proposed as the active one for
the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from the polysaccharide substrate,4,31,32 but density functional theory
(DFT) model calculations by Kim et al.17 and, more recently, Bertini et al.18 on
the oxidation of “cellulosic” substrate by an AA9 LPMO
have cast doubt on such a possibility. Since direct HAA from the substrate
is unfavorable,17,18 it is likely that the Cu(II)-O2– species first converts to copper(II)-hydroperoxo
[Cu(II)–OOH–] (Scheme 1) by abstracting a H atom or via proton-coupled
electron transfer (PCET) from a suitable co-substrate (e.g., ascorbate),
depending on whether the electron and the proton are transferred simultaneously
or separately, respectively.

Two distinct mechanistic routes
can be envisaged for the reactivity
of Cu(II)-OOH– in LPMO. Phillips et al.4 proposed that a second electron transfer (coupled
with distal O protonation) could facilitate the homolytic cleavage
of the O–O bond, releasing a water molecule and forming a Cu–oxyl
active species, Cu(II)-O• – (route
I in Scheme 1). Alternatively,
Cu(II)-OOH– may react via its proximal O, leading
to the formation of Cu(I) and H2O2 (route II
in Scheme 1). In a
recent work,33 we demonstrated, in silico,
that such Cu(I)-H2O2 species can evolve toward
the reaction products. Specifically, H2O2 can
be efficiently activated by LPMO-Cu(I) via a low-barrier homolysis
mechanism, forming Cu(II)–OH and a caged hydroxyl radical intermediate
(HO·) that evolves toward the highly reactive Cu(II)-O• – species, which is the one oxidizing
the polysaccharide substrate. However, it remains to be demonstrated
whether Cu(I)···H2O2 is integral
to the catalytic cycle (route II).

Although the reactivity of
Cu(II)-O• – is well-recognized, having
been proposed as the active species of
LPMO by computational studies,17−19 the detailed molecular mechanism
of O2 activation and specifically the formation of this
highly reactive species remains one of the most intriguing unanswered
questions in LPMO catalysis. The full catalytic cycle (Scheme 1) involves several electron
transfer steps that are mediated by a reductant. Therefore, the role
of reductant is critical in the overall mechanism. From a computational
perspective, however, reliable modeling of the reductant presents
challenges, not least of which are those associated with accurate
solvation energies of the reducing agent and the dynamic reorganization
of the environment. Accordingly, electron-transfer related processes,
such as electron transfer (ET), proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET),
and hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) involving the reductant have been
somewhat neglected in previous mechanistic studies.17−19 As a consequence,
it is unknown whether any of the previously suggested mechanisms for
O2 activation is kinetically feasible.17−19

To address
the above issues, we here employ a combination of molecular
dynamics (MD) and QM/MM MD simulations to investigate the full O2 activation mechanism of LPMOs in the presence of ascorbic
acid, one of the most common reductants used in LPMO assays. Our results
lead to the identification of a possible pathway in which Cu(I)···H2O2 forms during the catalytic cycle. Based on the
present findings, a mechanism of LPMOs is proposed that explains the
available experimental information and, in particular, the substrate
dependence of the reactivity of the Cu(I)···H2O2 intermediate.

Methods
System Setup
The
initial structure of LPMO was prepared
on the basis of the recently determined crystal structure of the LPMO
enzyme in complex with an oligosaccharide substrate (PDB code: 5ACF, with a resolution of 1.8 Å).30 The substrate was removed from the structure
and the equatorial Cl– ligand bound to Cu center
was either replaced by O2 (to model the Cu(II)-O2– species) or by OOH (to model Cu(II)–OOH– species). We assigned the protonation states of titratable
residues (His, Glu, Asp) on the basis of pKa values, using the PROPKA software34 in
combination with careful visual inspection of local hydrogen-bonded
networks. Histidine residues His66, His78, His79, His125, and His131
were protonated at Nδ, while His147 was protonated
at Nδ and His122 was doubly protonated. All glutamic
acid and aspartic acid residues were deprotonated. To investigate
the possibility of His147 or Glu148 acting as proton donors during
the reaction, these residues were selectively protonated. In these
cases in which ascorbate was involved in the reaction, it was docked
into the LPMO active site using the AutoDock Vina tool35 in Chimera.36 The
general AMBER force field (GAFF)37 was
used for ascorbate, with the partial atomic charges obtained from
the RESP model,38 at the HF/6-31G* level
of theory. The force field for the enzyme resting state, Cu(II)-O2– and Cu(II)-OOH– states
were parametrized using the “MCPB.py” modeling tool39 of AmberTools16. The Amber ff14SB force field40 was employed for the protein residues. Sodium
ions were added to the protein surface to neutralize the total charge
of the systems. Finally, the resulting system was solvated in a rectangular
box of TIP3P waters extending up to a minimum distance of 18 Å
from the protein surface.

Classical MD Simulations
After proper
setup, the structures
were fully minimized using a combination of steepest descent and conjugate
gradients methods. The system was subsequently gently annealed from
10 K to 300 K in the canonical ensemble for 50 ps, using a weak restraint
of 15 kcal/mol/Å on the protein backbone atoms. To achieve a
uniform density after heating dynamics, 1 ns of density equilibration
was performed under isothermal–isobaric ensemble at a target
temperature and pressure of 300 K and 1.0 atm, respectively, using
the Langevin thermostat41 and the Berendsen
barostats,42 with collision frequency of
2 ps and pressure-relaxation time of 1 ps. Thereafter, all restraints
were removed and the system was further equilibrated for 3 ns. Finally,
a 50 ns production MD run was performed. In those cases in which either
ascorbate or an H3O+ ion was involved in the
reaction, their positions were restrained with a weak restraint of
5 kcal/mol/Å during equilibration and production MD simulations,
avoiding that they diffuse into the bulk water. All MD simulations
used the SHAKE algorithm, along with an integration step of 2 fs and
they were performed with the GPU version of the Amber 16 package.43

QM/MM MD and Metadynamics Simulations
One representative
snapshot extracted from each classical MD trajectory was used for
the subsequent QM/MM MD simulation. All QM/MM MD simulations were
performed with the CP2K 4.1 package,44,45 combining
the QM program QUICKSTEP45 and the MM driver
FIST. In this code, a real space multigrid technique is used to compute
the electrostatic coupling between the QM and MM regions.46,47 The QM region was treated at the DFT(B3LYP) level, employing a dual
basis set of Gaussian and plane-waves (GPW) formalism,45 whereas the MM region was modeled at the classical
level using the same force-field as in the classical MD simulations.
The QM region included at least the Cu cofactor, the Hic1 residue
and the side chains of residues His78 and Tyr164. Gln162 was included
in the QM region for those reactions in which this residue directly
interacts either with O2 or the OOH moiety. Other additional
residues that were included for specific reactions are described in
the manuscript. The wave function was expanded in a Gaussian double-ζ
valence polarized (DZVP) basis set,48 while
an auxiliary plane-wave basis set with a cutoff of 360 Ry was used
to converge the electron density, in conjunction with Goedecker–Teter–Hutter
(GTH) pseudopotentials49,50 for treating the core electrons.
To accelerate the calculation of the Hartree–Fock exchange
within B3LYP, the auxiliary density matrix method (ADMM) was used.51 All QM/MM MD simulations were performed in the
NVT ensemble using an integration time step of 0.5 fs. The systems
were equilibrated without any constraint for 1.5 ps and the well-tempered
metadynamics52,53 method was used to explore the
free-energy profile for each reaction step. Specific collective variables
used for the different reaction steps are described in the manuscript.
The width of the Gaussian-shaped potential hills was taken between
0.1 Å and 0.2 Å. The Gaussian height was set to 0.6 kcal/mol,
while the time deposition interval between two consecutive Gaussians
was set to 12.5 fs.

Results and Discussion
Overview of the Redox Chemistry
of Ascorbic Acid
Ascorbic
acid (Asc) or vitamin C is an important biological cofactor54−57 and has been extensively used as an electron donor for the activity
of LPMOs.2,4−8,20 Its redox chemistry is summarized
in Scheme 2. Ascorbic
acid is a weak acid, with a pKa of 4.17.
Thus, it exists predominantly in the form of the ascorbate monoanion
(AscH–) at physiological pH and also at the pHs
typically used in LPMO assays. The AscH– species
is known to be a good electron donor, which either donates one electron
to form the neutral ascorbyl radical (AscH·), or
it simultaneously donates an electron and a proton to form the ascorbyl
radical anion (Asc• –).34 We computed the ionization energies (IEs) for
the three possible electron donor species (AscH–, AscH·, and, Asc• –, Scheme 2), and found
that ascorbate (AscH–) has the lowest ionization
energy (see Table S1 in the Supporting
Information), indicating that it is the most efficient one-electron
donor, as suggested by experiments.

Chemistry of Ascorbic Acid, along with Computed
Ionization Energy (IE, in kcal/mol) and Experimental pKa Values from ref (54)
Reduction of the Resting
State LPMO-Cu(II) to Cu(I) by Ascorbate
Since ascorbate is
the predominant species and the most efficient
one-electron donor, we first investigated the possible reduction of
LPMO-Cu(II) by ascorbate (first step in Scheme 1). Calculation of the ionization energy of
ascorbate (AscH–) and the electron affinity of Cu(II)
shows that removal of an electron from ascorbate requires an energy
of 92.6 kcal/mol (see eq 1), while giving an electron to Cu(II) releases −114.5 kcal/mol
(eq 2). Thus, the reduction
of Cu(II) by ascorbate is expected to be thermodynamically quite favorable.
This agrees with the experimental evidence that the LPMO-Cu (II) resting
state can be reduced to Cu(I) in the presence of ascorbic acid.27,58 Consistently, QM/MM MD simulations (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) of LPMO-Cu(II) in the presence
of an ascorbate molecule show that there is a one-electron spin density
located on the ascorbate molecule (Figure 2). This indicated that ascorbate has been
oxidized to ascorbyl radical (AscH·), while Cu(II)
has been reduced to Cu(I), as represented by eq 3. For comparison, we also investigated the
alternative conformation, in which ascorbate is directly complexed
with Cu(II). The resulting spin density (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) shows that in this case AscH– is not able to transfer an electron to Cu(II). This
suggests that water molecules play important roles in electron transfer,
probably stabilizing the charge-separated product state. 1   2   3

Formation of Cu(II)-OOH–
Once Cu(II)
has been reduced to Cu(I), molecular oxygen can bind to it in the
equatorial position to form the Cu(II)-O2– intermediate (the second step in Scheme 1), for which a triplet spin state has been
determined.17−19 As discussed above, ascorbate is a very good hydrogen
donor,54 so it is likely that Cu(II)-O2– abstracts one H atom from an ascorbate
molecule to generate Cu(II)-OOH–. The O–H
bond dissociation energy of ascorbate has been reported to be ∼73.6
kcal/mol,54 while the computationally calculated
C–H bond dissociation energy in a polysaccharide is >100
kcal/mol.59 As such, abstracting a H atom
from ascorbate
is clearly much more favorable than from the polysaccharide substrate.

Figure 3a shows
the QM/MM free-energy profile corresponding to the abstraction of
one H atom from ascorbate by Cu(II)-O2–. The reaction is quite facile, with a free-energy barrier of 4.7
kcal/mol (Figure 3a).
Analysis of the spin density population of the active site along the
reaction (Figure 3b)
reveals that two unpaired electrons are initially located on Cu(II)
and O2–, respectively (3RC1). Once ascorbate donates one H atom to Cu(II)-O2–, Cu(II)-OOH– and the anion
ascorbyl radical (Asc• –) form (3IC1 in Figure 3a).

coordinate is defined as the distance between the O1 atom of Cu(II)-O2– and the H1 atom of ascorbate. [Legend:
RC = reactant complex, IC = intermediate complex, and TS = transition
state.] (b) Representative structures of the QM region along the reaction
pathway. Spin-up isodensity surfaces are plotted in yellow.

It could be argued that Cu(II)-O2– abstracts an H atom from the neutral ascorbyl
radical (AscH·) rather than ascorbate (AscH–), leading
to the same product Cu(II)-OOH– species. Our simulations
predict this to be a facile process (ΔG⧧ = 1.8 kcal/mol; see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). However, AscH• is a high-energy and highly acidic species (pKa = −0.45),54 and it may
rapidly dissociate in water before the HAA reaction. Thus, the most
abundant and stable AscH– is more likely to be the
predominant H atom donor for Cu(II)-OOH– generation,
forming an ascorbyl radical anion (Asc• –). As the subsequent reaction step requires an additional H (H+ + e–), as indicated in Scheme 1, we can assume that the Asc• – anion will exit the active site, being
replaced by a fresh ascorbate molecule that can act as H atom donor,
as required for the further reactivity of Cu(II)-OOH–.

Route I: Direct Formation of Cu(II)-O• – from Cu(II)-OOH–
Starting from the LPMO-Cu(II)-OOH– + AscH– complex, we investigated
the mechanism of Cu(II)-O• – formation
via direct O–O cleavage of Cu(II)-OOH– (route
I in Scheme 1). Two
possible pathways can be envisaged, depending whether the proton and
electron required to cleave the O–O bond travel together (HAA)
or separately (PCET). These two pathways are depicted in Scheme 3. All our attempts
to abstract one hydrogen atom from ascorbate (Scheme 3a), coupled with O–O bond cleavage
resulted in a free-energy barrier of at least 26 kcal/mol (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), indicating
that the HAA pathway is unfavorable.

Scheme 3 Two Possible Mechanisms
for the Direct Formation of Cu(II)-O• – from Cu(II)-OOH– (Pathway I in Scheme 1): (a) HAA-Mediated O–O
Homolysis and (b) PCET-Mediated O–O
Homolysis
Alternatively, protonation
of the distal oxygen by an additional
proton donor could be coupled with the transfer of one electron from
ascorbate (Scheme 3b), triggering heterolytic O–O cleavage and formation of Cu(II)-O• –. This is a typical PCET process and
requires an additional proton donor, in contrast to the HAA mechanism
of Scheme 3a. The identity
of the proton donor is elusive from all previous studies. Therefore,
several species were tested as proton donor candidate (Scheme 4): protonated Glu148, a hydronium
ion (H3O+) and ascorbic acid. His147 was not
considered, in view of its low pKa, as
discussed later. None of these proton donors is likely to be stable
or the dominating species at the optimal pH of LPMO60 (see the discussion in the Supporting Information (section 2)). However, they may be present in small
amounts, which may catalyze the PCET-mediated O–O heterolysis.

Scheme 4 Three Possible Proton Donors That Could Be Involved in Cu(II)-O• – Formation via the PCET-Mediated O–O
Heterolysis of Cu(II)-OOH–: (a) Protonated Glu148,
(b) H3O+ Ion, and (c) Ascorbic Acid (Asc)
Glu148 is not in direct contact
with the OOH moiety, thus proton
transfer via its carboxylic acid side chain can only be mediated by
a water molecule.30 However, our simulations
of LPMO-Cu(II)-OOH– with protonated Glu148 in the
presence of ascorbate did not show any persistent water molecule between
the distal oxygen of Cu(II)-OOH– and Glu148 that
could play this role (Figure S5 in the
Supporting Information). Thus, Glu148 can be excluded as a potential
proton donor. Similarly, simulations considering H3O+ as a proton donor (Scheme 4b) showed that it rapidly donates one proton to ascorbate
(within ∼100 fs; see Figures S6 and S7), leading to the more stable ascorbic acid species. Thus, the only
possibility left is that PCET from ascorbic acid could catalyze the
heterolytic cleavage of the O–O bond. QM/MM metadynamics simulations
designed to drive the system from Cu(II)-OOH– to
Cu(II)-O• – (Figure 4) showed that, once the O–O bond breaks,
not only the distal oxygen (O2) receives a proton from ascorbic acid
(via the active site water molecule), but also the proximal oxygen
spontaneously abstracts a hydrogen atom (HAA) from its closest ascorbic
acid hydroxyl group, forming Cu(II)–OH– and
dehydroascorbate (see Figure 4). In addition, the reaction requires a high free-energy barrier
(29.6 kcal/mol), indicating that the ascorbic acid-mediated O–O
cleavage of Cu(II)-OOH (route I in Scheme 1) is unfavorable.

Figure 4 (a) Free-energy profile
for PCET-mediated O–O heterolysis
via ascorbic acid, obtained from QM/MM metadynamics. The reaction
coordinate was defined as the distance difference between O2 and water
H1 (d1) and that between O2 to O1 (d2). [Legend: RC = reactant complex,
TS = transition state, and PC = product complex.] (b) Representative
structures of the QM region along the reaction pathway. Spin-up and
spin-down isodensity surfaces are plotted in yellow and red, respectively.
At the transition state (2TS3), a water molecule
forms and one electron spin-density evolves on the ascorbic acid molecule.
Nevertheless, the so-formed LPMO-Cu(II)-O• –/AscH· complex is quite unstable and Cu(II)-O• – further abstracts a hydrogen atom
from AscH·, leading to the more stable LPMO-Cu(II)–OH–/dehydroascorbate product complex (3PC3).

Note that the feasibility
of Cu(II)-OOH– undergoing
PCET is dependent on three main factors: cleavage of O–O bond,
proton transfer to the distal O2, and electron transfer from ascorbate
to Cu(II)-OOH–. Among these factors, the first two
are intrinsic to LPMO, while the third is dependent on the electron-donating
efficiency of the reductant. Even though ascorbic acid is one of the
most efficient small molecule electron donors, it is not able to trigger
the PCET-mediated O–O heterolysis of Cu(II)-OOH–, as demonstrated in this study. Thus, it is not expected that other
small molecule reductants could be competent in LPMO catalysis. However,
our work does not speak to how enzymatic electron donors like cellobiose
dehydrogenase (CDH) work in LPMO.4,10,21 If some “active” unpaired electrons
can be generated or reserved for LPMOs during the action of CDH, the
electron donor efficiency might be enhanced, which may reduce the
energy barrier for PCET.

Route II: Indirect Formation of Cu(II)-O• – from Cu(II)-OOH– via the Cu(I)-H2O2 Intermediate
In
the above section, we ruled out
all the possible pathways leading to Cu(II)-O• – via the direct O–O cleavage of Cu(II)-OOH– (route I in Scheme 1). Here, we address the reactivity of Cu(II)-OOH– toward H2O2 formation (route II). For this
to happen, it is necessary that the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– receives a proton (or a hydrogen atom). Two pathways can be envisaged,
depending whether proton transfer (PT) or hydrogen atom abstraction
(HAA) occurs (Scheme 5). Protonation of the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– leads to the formation of H2O2 and Cu(II)
(Scheme 5a). Alternatively,
the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– may abstract a H atom
from ascorbate or Tyr164, forming H2O2 and Cu(I)
(see Schemes 5b and 5c).

Scheme 5 Three Possible Mechanistic Pathways for
H2O2 Formation from Cu(II)-OOH– Species: (a) H2O2 Formation via the Proton
Transfer to Proximal
O of Cu(II)-OOH–; (b) H2O2 Formation via HAA from Ascorbate by the Proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH–; (c) H2O2 Formation via HAA
from Tyr164 Residue by the Proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH–
Protonation of the proximal
O of Cu(II)-OOH– (Scheme 5a) requires an appropriate
proton donor in the active site, located near the proximal oxygen
atom. The only residue that can play this role is His147, which is
located ∼5 Å from Cu in the crystal structure.30 This second-sphere residue has been suggested
as a possible proton donor in a recent experimental study.61 However, the calculated pKa of His147 is ∼3.5 (see the SI); therefore, it is expected to be in its neutral form at the optimal
pH of 6.0–7.0 for LPMO, which is consistent with our previous
study.33 The local hydrogen-bond network
of His147 is also consistent with it being singly protonated at Nε. In fact, QM/MM metadynamics simulations starting with
doubly protonated His147 show that such reaction does not lead to
a stable product (Figure S8), ruling out
H2O2 formation via the proton transfer pathway
of Scheme 5a. Considering
that the calculated pKa of His147 is very
low (∼3.5), it is not expected that other residues would be
able to mediate the H2O2 formation via the proton
transfer of Scheme 5a.

The second mechanistic possibility is that Cu(II)-OOH– abstracts a H atom from ascorbate or Tyr164, forming
H2O2 and Cu(I) (see Schemes 5b and 5c). Since ascorbate
is
both the dominant species and the efficient H atom donor, this reaction
is expected to be feasible. Figure 5 shows the computed free-energy profile, along with
representative structures of the active site along the reaction pathway.
There is a significant amount of spin density is located on the proximal
O of Cu(II)-OOH– at the reactants state (2RC5), suggesting this site may be efficient for the
HAA reaction (Figure 5b). In fact, HAA from ascorbate by the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– involves a moderate barrier of ∼7.7 kcal/mol
(Figure 5a), leading
to the formation of H2O2 and an anion ascorbyl
radical (Asc• –). The formation of
Asc• – is confirmed by analysis of
the spin density (2PC5). Very recently, QM/MM
calculations62 were performed to investigate
the thermodynamics of H2O2 generation. In particular,
it was found that H2O2 generation on LPMO-Cu(I),
computed according to the reaction O2 + 2H++
2e– → H2O2,
is thermodynamically favorable, which is consistent with our QM/MM
MD-metadynamics results.

We also considered H2O2 formation via HAA
from Tyr164 by the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH–(Scheme 5c). However, the
calculated free-energy barrier turned out to be quite high (23.7 kcal/mol,
see Figure S9 in the SI), the resulting
H2O2 product complex is quite unstable (21.8
kcal/mol, relative to the initial reactant) and the reaction leads
to a Tyr anion instead of the initially assumed Tyr radical. Clearly,
Tyr164 is not efficient at mediating the H2O2 formation from Cu(II)-OOH– species.

Therefore,
a thorough analysis of all possible reaction pathways
leads to the conclusion that the most likely reaction pathway
from the Cu(II)-OOH–intermediate is that in which its proximal oxygen atom abstracts
a hydrogen atom from ascorbate, leading to H2O2and Cu(I) (route II in Scheme 1). Afterwards, the Cu(I)-catalyzed O–O homolysis
of H2O2 leads to the formation of Cu(II)-O• –, as demonstrated in our previous work.33 In addition to ascorbate, we speculate that
other reducing agents containing a redox-active hydroxyl group may
activate the LPMO with similar mechanism to the one demonstrated herein.
Thus, our findings may also explain the reactivity of other reducing
co-substrates used in LPMO catalysis, such as gallate.63,64

Is the Formation of Cu(II)-O• – Catalyzed
by His147?
During the writing of this manuscript,
a QM/MM study in the absence of reductant appeared19 in which the authors suggest that O2 activation
and Cu(II)-O• – formation is catalyzed
by the protonated His147 (as the proton donor), as shown in Scheme 6. In this mechanism,
the protonation of Cu(II)-O2– first leads
to Cu(II) and a HOO• radical (4a),
followed by one-electron reduction to form Cu(II)-OOH– in a second protonation round from His147 (4b). Subsequently,
proton transfer from His147 to the distal O of Cu(II)-OOH– triggers the heterolytic O–O cleavage of Cu(II)-OOH–, leading to Cu(III)-O• – (6a). A subsequent one-electron reduction generates the Cu(II)-O• – reactive species (6b).

Scheme 6 Proposed Mechanisms for O2 Activation by LPMO from ref
(6)
In principle, the generation of a high-energy
Cu(III) product is
expected to be an unfavorable process.33 However, a low barrier of ∼10 kcal/mol was reported19 for the proton-mediated O–O cleavage
step (4b → 6a in Scheme 6). Herein, we revisited
this key step using the more advanced ab initio QM/MM MD simulations. Figure 6a shows the computed
free-energy profile for the His147-catalyzed O–O heterolysis
of Cu(II)-OOH–, while Figure 6b shows the representative structures of
the QM region along the reaction pathway. It can be seen that O1–O2
bond cleavage coupled with proton transfer from His147 to O2 is highly
unfavorable, involving an energy barrier >30 kcal/mol. Moreover,
the
so-formed “Cu(III)-O• –”
product is a highly unstable species, corresponding to a very shallow
minimum on the free-energy profile. Close inspection of the spin density
population in 2PC6 reveals the precise electronic state
of 2PC6. The spin-down unpaired electron (red isodensity)
is located mostly on Cu (↓), arguing for a formal Cu(II)
oxidation state. For the two spin-up unpaired electrons (yellow isodensity),
one is located on O1 atom (↑), while the other is highly
delocalized over Hic1, Tyr164 and Gln162 (↑). As such,
the so-formed “Cu(III)-O• –” product is better described as [Hic + Tyr + Gln]• +—Cu(II)-O• –. Therefore, the
Cu(III) product is quite unstable and abstracts an electron from the
surrounding residues, oxidizing the enzyme. Overall, our calculations
do not support the proton transfer-mediated heterolytic cleavage of
Cu(II)-OOH– toward Cu(II)-O• – formation, as it is kinetically highly unfavorable and would lead
to the oxidation of the enzyme.

Reactivity of LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH– vs Heme-Fe(III)-OOH–
It
is interesting to compare the reactivity
of the Cu(II)-OOH– intermediate in LPMO with that
of heme enzymes. Heme enzymes, including P45065,66 and heme peroxidases,67,68 employ a well-established
PCET mechanism to generate Fe(IV)–oxo porphyrin π-cation
radical active species [Porph•+-Fe(IV)=O],
denoted as compound I, from ferric hydroperoxide species [Porph-Fe(III)-OOH–]. Why is the Cu(II)-OOH– species
in LPMO not able to undergo a similar PCET-mediated O–O heterolysis?

As discussed above, the occurrence of the PCET mechanism is dependent
on three factors: the O–O bond strength, the efficiency of
proton transfer, and the efficiency of electron transfer. With respect
to proton transfer, all these enzymes are similar, commonly using
a protonated titratable residue (His, Glu, Asp) as proton donor. Concerning
O–O bond strength, we predicted a O–O bond dissociation
energy (BDE) of ∼40 kcal/mol for LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH–, and ∼25 kcal/mol for P450–Fe(III)-OOH–, respectively (see Figure S10 in the SI). Clearly, the O–O bond in LPMO–-Cu(II)-OOH– is much stronger than that in P450–Fe(III)-OOH–. Considering electron transfer efficiency, it is known
that heme P450 or peroxidases utilizes the porphyrin as the electron
donor,65−67,69,70 so the process is described as intramolecular electron transfer.
By contrast, LPMO requires an external electron donor such as small
molecule reductants or CDH,16 which are
featured as intermolecular electron transfer (Scheme 7). The kinetics of electron transfer are
highly dependent on the coupling of the electron donor state and electron
acceptor state71 and it is expected that
the electronic coupling is much stronger for intramolecular electron
transfer than for intermolecular electron transfer. This explains
why LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH– is less efficient for
PCET-mediated O–O heterolysis than P450–Fe(III)-OOH–.

(BDEs) of O–O are given in units of kcal/mol. LPMO is featured
as intermolecular electron transfer, while P450 is featured as intramolecular
electron transfer.

Although the LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH– is too stable
for O–O cleavage reactions (either homolysis or heterolysis),
the unique radical character on its proximal O atom opens up reaction
avenues toward HAA reactions. As demonstrated here, the proximal O
of Cu(II)-OOH– can efficiently abstract a hydrogen
atom from ascorbate, leading to the formation of H2O2 and Cu(I). Similarly, Cu(II)-OOH– could
undergo HAA from active H atoms of biomass components, such as lignin,
to activate LPMO. In fact, a boosting effect of lignin on the performance
of LPMO has been observed by experiment.72−75

Proposed Catalytic Cycle
of LPMO
Based on our present
findings, we now propose a catalytic cycle of LPMO in the presence
of ascorbate reductant (Scheme 8). This catalytic cycle is consistent with experimental data
and furthermore provides an explanation for the enigmatic substrate
dependence of LPMO reactivity and hydrogen peroxide formation that
is observed in the absence of substrate. Our proposal assumes that
the association of LPMO with substrate during the reaction cycle is
flexible at all stages of the reaction cycle, allowing access of both
O2 and reducing agent to the active site. Such dynamic
processes have been experimentally demonstrated for LPMO-substrate-reducing
agent interactions.60

Scheme 8 Full Catalytic Cycle
of LPMO in the Presence of Ascorbic Acid Proposed
in This Work
Starting from the
resting state of LPMO, Cu(II) undergoes the one-electron
reduction to Cu(I) by ascorbate. This is followed by rapid O2 binding to generate the LPMO–Cu(II)-O2– species. Afterward, LPMO–Cu(II)-O2– abstracts a hydrogen atom (HAA) from ascorbate to generate LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH–. Starting from this species, our calculations uncovered
an accessible pathway in which the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– abstracts a hydrogen atom from another ascorbate, leading to the
formation of H2O2 and Cu(I). To check whether
the bound substrate could interfere with H2O2 generation via HAA from ascorbate, QM/MM MD simulations were performed
on the Cu(II)-OOH– species in the presence of both
ascorbate and the polysaccharide substrate. The simulations indicate
that ascorbate, via its redox-active hydroxyl group, has strong tendency
to form a hydrogen bond with the proximal O of Cu-OOH. (See Figure 7, as well as Figure S11 in the SI.) This suggests that the
binding of the polysaccharide substrate would have minor effects on
H2O2 formation via HAA from ascorbate. The so-formed
Cu(I)-H2O2 intermediate will either then convert
to LPMO–Cu(II)-O• – via the
homolysis/HAA mechanism,33 or lose H2O2 in the uncoupling pathway (see Scheme 8). The balance of these two
pathways is critically dependent on the affinity of the LPMO for the
substrate.

Figure 7 Structure of the LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH– intermediate
in the presence of ascorbate and the polysaccharide substrate obtained
from QM/MM MD simulations.

The competition of these two pathways (coupling versus uncoupling)
is also dependent on the residence time of H2O2 in the active site of LPMO-Cu(I). According to our previous study,33 the H2O2 co-substrate
is bound to the active site of LPMO-Cu(I). Moreover, the active site
of LPMO is exposed to bulk water. In such case, the binding of the
substrate plays a key role in stabilizing H2O2 in the active site of LPMO–Cu(I). If a polysaccharide substrate
is properly bound on the enzyme surface, H2O2 will be barricaded by the substrate and its diffusion to the bulk
water will be prevented. In such cases, the H2O2 molecule can be efficiently activated by LPMO-Cu(I) via a low-barrier
homolysis/HAA mechanism, as previously demonstrated,33 leading to the LPMO–Cu(II)-O• – active species, which, in turn, oxidizes the substrate. This is
the productive pathway, thus it can be called “coupling”
pathway. However, in substrate-free LPMO, or when substrate binding
is not effective enough, the hydrophilic H2O2 molecule may diffuse into the bulk water (uncoupling pathway in Scheme 8). This is in agreement
with the experimental findings20 that a
“suitable” substrate could inhibit H2O2 generation and lead to a coupling reaction, while an “unsuitable”
substrate, which is either too small or not fit for the active site
of LPMO, may completely lead to an uncoupling reaction (H2O2 generation). Interestingly, such substrate-dependent
reactivity of H2O2 in LPMO is quite similar
to that of P450 heme enzymes, as previously demonstrated.76

The substrate-dependent reactivity of
H2O2 described above is consistent with our
present and past computational
results. Our previous QM/MM optimized structure of LPMO–Cu(I)-H2O2 showed that H2O2 remains
at a distance of 2.77 Å with Cu(I) in the presence of the polysaccharide
substrate. We also found that the stabilization and reorientation
of H2O2 in the active site is mainly controlled
by second sphere residues such as His78, His147, Gln162, Glu148, and
the substrate. In particular, the binding of the substrate has a tendency
to block H2O2,33 preventing
its diffusion from the active site into the bulk water. In contrast,
when the polysaccharide substrate is not present (Figure 5a) the so-generated H2O2 product (2PC5) remains at a
much longer distance (∼3.5 Å) away from the Cu(I) center,
suggesting that it could escape the active site.

To further
reveal the dynamic movement of H2O2 in the absence
of substrate, QM/MM MD simulations were performed
on 2PC5. It was found that H2O2 moves away from Cu(I), while a nearby water
(Wat1 in Figure 8)
penetrates into the active site simutaneously. Finally, this water
molecule binds weakly to Cu(I), while H2O2 remains
separated from Cu(I) by two water molecules (Wat1 and Wat2). Thus,
the in-situ-generated H2O2 molecule has a tendency
to diffuse into the bulk water in the absence of substrate, which
is quite facile, as predicted by our QM/MM MD simulations. In summary,
the polysaccharide substrate not only barricades the H2O2 molecule, but also prevents the entry of bulk water
molecules into the active site. As a consequence, the in-situ-generated
H2O2 can further react with Cu(I) to form the
Cu(II)-O• – active species (via the
“coupling” pathway in Scheme 8).

in the LPMO
active site in the absence of the polysaccharide substrate from QM/MM
MD simulation. Representative structures extracted from the simulations
(2PC5 state).

Our work and that of others24,78 suggest that,
in order
to understand and then to develop H2O2-dependent
LPMOs toward practical applications, one must consider both the substrate
affinity to the active site and the possible hydrogen-bonding interactions
between H2O2 and its surrounding residues. In
particular, hydrophilic residues (e.g., Glu, Asp, His, Gln, or Asn)
in the active site or located on the enzyme surface would favor both
the H2O2 co-substrate and polysaccharide substrate
binding, which, thus, may lead to efficient H2O2 activation. It is also conceivable that different LPMOs may exhibit
different propensities in this regard.

Conclusions
Using
QM(B3LYP)/MM metadynamics simulations, we have uncovered
the oxygen activation and H2O2 formation mechanisms
in LPMOs in the presence of reductant ascorbic acid (Asc). Our simulations
demonstrate that the resting state Cu(II) can be reduced to Cu(I)
instantaneously in the presence of ascorbate. This is followed by
O2 binding to generate the LPMO–Cu(II)-O2– species, which then perform a facile hydrogen
atom abstraction (HAA) from ascorbate to generate LPMO–Cu(II)-OOH–. As the O–H bond of ascorbate is much weaker
than the C–H bond of polysaccharide, HAA from ascorbate is
much more favorable than that from the polysaccharide substrate. Afterward,
we investigated all possible reaction pathways starting from Cu(II)-OOH–, and we were able to rule out any PCET- or proton
transfer-mediated O–O cleavage mechanisms toward Cu(II)-O• – formation. Meanwhile, we identified
a possible pathway in which the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– abstracts a hydrogen atom from ascorbate, leading to the formation
of H2O2 and Cu(I). The high radical character
on the proximal O of Cu(II)-OOH– opens up reaction
avenues toward HAA reactions, which may have implications in other
copper-dependent enzymes.

Based on the present computational
findings, a catalytic cycle
of LPMOs is proposed in which O2 is the oxidative co-substrate
for LPMOs, from which an H2O2 intermediate is
formed in situ via the activation of O2 by reducing agents.
Critically, the catalytic cycle explains the observed substrate dependence
of the reactivity of the H2O2 intermediate,
where the in-situ-generated H2O2 intermediate
either converts to LPMO–Cu(II)-O• – via the homolysis/HAA mechanism in a coupling pathway, or diffuses
into the bulk water in an uncoupling pathway. The competition of these
two pathways is dependent on the binding of substrate. A “suitable”
substrate could barricade H2O2 and prevent H2O2 diffusion into the bulk water. Our results also
speak to the ongoing debate about the activation of LPMOs by either
O2 or H2O2, showing that the two
mechanistic pathways are connected. The present findings have far-reaching
implications in O2 activation and H2O2 formation mechanism by other copper enzymes.77
