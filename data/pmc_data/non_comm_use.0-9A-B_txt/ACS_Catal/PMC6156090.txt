Surface carbon (coke, carbonaceous
deposits) is an integral aspect
of methane dehydroaromatization catalyzed by Mo/zeolites. We investigated
the evolution of surface carbon species from the beginning of the
induction period until the complete catalyst deactivation by the pulse
reaction technique, TGA, 13C NMR, TEM, and XPS. Isotope
labeling was performed to confirm the catalytic role of confined carbon
species during MDA. It was found that “hard” and “soft”
coke distinction is mainly related to the location of coke species
inside the pores and on the external surface, respectively. In addition,
MoO3 species act as an active oxidation catalyst, reducing
the combustion temperature of a certain fraction of coke. Furthermore,
after dissolving the zeolite framework by HF, we found that coke formed
during the MDA reaction inside the zeolite pores is essentially a
zeolite-templated carbon material. The possibility of preparing zeolite-templated
carbons from the most available hydrocarbon feedstock is important
for the development of these interesting materials.

Introduction
Methane dehydroaromatization
(MDA) is a promising technology for
the direct conversion of methane, the main component of natural gas,
to liquid aromatics.1 This reaction has
not resulted in a commercial process yet, mainly because the benchmark
MDA catalysts such as Mo/ZSM-5 and Mo/MCM-22 quickly deactivate due
to coking. Formation of coke over Mo/zeolite catalysts under the MDA
conditions cannot be avoided because high temperatures (≥700
°C) are needed for an appreciable conversion of methane to benzene.
Under these conditions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and eventually
graphite are more stable than the desired light aromatic products,
requiring the use of shape-selective zeolites like ZSM-5 or MCM-22.2,3 Considering the relatively short lifetime of MDA catalysts, several
approaches to decrease the coking rate have been investigated. For
instance, a small amount of oxygen can be supplied to the reaction
to continuously burn the coke species without extensive oxidation
of the active Mo phase to Mo(VI). This can be achieved by using either
oxygen-permeable ceramic membranes4−6 or short oxygen pulses.7 Complete regeneration of (partially) deactivated
MDA catalysts through controlled reaction–regeneration cycling
with hydrogen8,9 or oxygen10,11 has also been explored.

Despite significant progress in this
area, the structure and evolution
of the coke species deposited during the MDA reaction remain elusive.
Temperature-programmed techniques such as temperature-programmed oxidation
(TPO) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are frequently used to
characterize the carbonaceous deposits.12 TPO traces of coke formed during the MDA reaction typically contain
several features attributed to molybdenum carbide, “soft”
or molybdenum-associated coke, and “hard” coke associated
with Brønsted acid sites.13−24 There are relatively few spectroscopic investigations of these coke
deposits. Weckhuysen et al. performed an extensive XPS study to show
that molybdenum carbide, sp2-type aromatic species and
hydrogen-poor sp-type species dominate the external surface of spent
Mo/ZSM-5.25 Tempelman et al. demonstrated
by UV–Raman spectroscopy study that the coke species are polyaromatic
hydrocarbons independent of time on stream.26

In a recent publication employing a pulse reaction technique
and
isotope labeling, we found that polyaromatic carbon species inside
the zeolite pores are involved in the formation of benzene during
the MDA reaction.27 We established that
partially reduced isolated Mo-species catalyze the initial conversion
of methane to yet unknown intermediates, which are involved in further
reactions with the polyaromatic hydrocarbons eliminating benzene and
other aromatics. The involvement of an organocatalytic intermediate
resembles the hydrocarbon-pool mechanism for methanol-to-hydrocarbon
(MTH) reactions.28 A pronounced difference
is that the MDA reaction likely involves radicals, unlike the MTH
reaction that proceeds via carbocation chemistry. Figure 1 provides a general scheme
of the radical-based hydrocarbon pool mechanism for the MDA reaction.

Figure 1 Scheme
of the hydrocarbon pool MDA mechanism for Mo/ZSM-5. The
formation of linear polyaromatic intermediates takes place during
the induction stage. Once the hydrocarbon pool is established the
formation of light aromatics occurs in parallel with the further growth
of polyaromatic species, eventually blocking the zeolite pores.

In this work, we focus on the
carbonaceous deposits formed on Mo/ZSM-5
during the MDA reaction at 700 °C using multiple characterization
techniques. First, we follow the rapid accumulation of carbon in the
micropores of ZSM-5 during the induction period. Isotope labeling
with 13C and D is employed to further underpin the conclusion
that confined coke species are actively involved in the MDA reaction.
Second, we analyze the evolution of coke species during prolonged
MDA reaction by 13C MAS NMR and DTG and demonstrate the
limited ability of TPO-based techniques for studying the chemical
speciation of coke. Finally, we characterize the carbon material in
spent MDA catalysts after removal of the zeolite by HF etching.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Materials
Supported Mo catalysts were
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of HZSM-5 powder (Si/Al
13, Süd-Chemie, now Clariant) with an aqueous solution of ammonium
heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (Merck) of appropriate concentration.
After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 110 °C overnight
and calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min.
Depending on Mo loading, the catalysts were denoted as 1% Mo (1 wt
% of Mo metal loading), 2% Mo, and 5% Mo. Additionally, Mo-containing
samples supported on activated carbon (RX-3, Norit), silicalite-1
(prepared according to ref (29)), and silica (Grace 643) were prepared by the same method
and denoted as Mo/AC (this sample was not calcined at 550 °C),
Mo/silicalite-1, and Mo/silica, respectively.

To liberate the
carbonaceous deposits from the zeolite, an amount of 1% Mo spent sample
was dissolved in an excess of HF (40%) for 2 h. The resulting solid
was washed with a copious amount of water on a paper filter and finally
dried at 110 °C overnight.

Catalyst Testing and Characterization
The prepared
catalysts were pelletized, crushed, and sieved to obtain particles
with a size of 0.25–0.5 mm. An amount of 0.3 g of sieved catalyst
was placed into a tubular quartz reactor (i.d. 4.0 mm, length 250
mm). The catalyst was supported by quartz wool plugs inside the isothermal
(700 °C) zone of the reactor. Typically, a 15 mL/min flow of
CH4/N2 mixture (95:5) was used, which represents
a CH4 WHSV of 2.0 h–1. For the isotope-labeling
studies, 13CH4 (99% 13C, Euriso-Top)
and CD4 (99% D, Euriso-Top) were used.

13C NMR MAS NMR spectra of coked catalysts were recorded on a 4.7 T
Bruker DRX-200 NMR spectrometer operating at 50.3 MHz. The measurements
were performed using a 4 mm MAS probe head with a sample rotation
rate of 8–10 kHz. Quantitative spectra were recorded using
the high-power proton decoupling direct excitation (HPDEC) pulse sequence
with an interscan delay of 10 s. The spectra were referenced to the 13C signal of adamantane at 38.56 ppm. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
was performed with a Bruker D2 powder diffraction system (Cu Kα
radiation, scan speed 0.01°/s, 2θ range 5 to 40°).
The external surface concentration of Mo species was estimated by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Thermo Scientific K-α
spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV)
X-ray source and a 180° double-focusing hemispherical analyzer
with a 128-channel detector. Textural properties were analyzed by
Ar physisorption carried out at −186 °C using a Micromeritics
ASAP-2020 apparatus. Nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) was
used to determine the pore size distribution of the materials. Prior
to the measurements, the samples were outgassed at 400 °C overnight.
For the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of coke species, a Mettler
Toledo TGA/DSC 1 instrument was applied. An amount of ca. 25 mg of
spent catalyst was placed in an uncovered alumina crucible, which
was heated to 900 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min in a 40 mL/min
He + 20 mL/min O2 flow. The morphology of the zeolite and
carbon particles was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
with a FEI Quanta 200F scanning electron microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 3–5 kV using aluminum sample holders. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were obtained with a FEI Tecnai
20 instrument at an electron acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

Modeling
of Carbon Species
A structural model of MFI-templated
carbon was constructed in Materials Studio 6.0 (Biovia, formerly Accelrys
Software, Inc.). The zeolite structure of MFI (silicalite-1) was taken
from the internal database. The polyaromatic structure confined inside
the silicalite-1 pores was subjected to a geometry optimization using
the COMPASS force field at energy and force convergence criteria of
0.1 and 0.5 cal/mol/Å, respectively. The Ewald summation method
was employed to account for the electrostatic and van der Waals contributions
to the energy. The zeolite framework was removed after this step in
order to analyze the pore sizes of the resulting carbon material.

Results and Discussion
Formation of Carbon Species during the Induction
Period
We followed the initial stage of the MDA reaction
by supplying short
pulses of methane to the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst bed as described before.27

As Figure 2 shows, we can distinguish three reaction stages: (i)
activation, involving the reduction of Mo(VI) with CO as main reaction
product; (ii) induction, involving formation of a significant amount
of surface carbon, which can be linked to an increasing amount of
benzene formation; and (iii) quasi-steady-state production
of benzene (and other light aromatics). The results show that the
formation of surface polyaromatics precedes that of benzene independent
of the Mo loading. This sequence of reactions can be explained by
the following scheme:  

Figure 2 Per-pulse conversion
of methane and yields of surface carbon species
(estimated by the carbon balance) and benzene during pulsing methane
over Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts. Stages of Mo(VI) reduction (activation);
extensive formation of surface carbon (induction) and quasi-steady-state benzene production can be distinguished. Additionally Figure S1 shows catalytic performance under flow
conditions, and Figure S2 presents the
distribution of all detected products during the pulse reaction test.
Conditions: 700 °C, 5 mL methane pulses every 200 s, 30 mL/min
flow of Ar carrier, MS analysis.

Further, we used isotope labeling to determine the involvement
of surface carbon and proton atoms into the produced aromatic molecules.
These experiments were performed by activating and inducing the catalysts
with 13CH4 or CD4, followed by thorough
flushing with Ar to remove any gaseous organic molecules from the
system (until complete disappearance of organic MS signals). Finally,
pulses of unlabeled CH4 were supplied to the catalyst bed. Figure 3 shows that the surface
carbon and hydrogen atoms are incorporated into the benzene molecules.
After activation and induction by 13CH4 pulses,
more than 65% of the produced benzene molecules contain at least one 13C atom during the first 12CH4 pulse.
The total 13C concentration in benzene is 20.3%. Upon further 12CH4 pulsing, the concentration of 13C labels in the benzene molecules expectedly decreases. However,
even after 10 12CH4 pulses the 13C concentration is about three times higher than the natural 13C abundance (1.1%). Although D incorporation was less pronounced
than 13C incorporation, the D content also gradually decreased
when more CH4 was pulsed. Apparent low degree of D incorporation
can be explained by a low H/C ratio of confined hydrocarbons and fast
H/D exchange of both methane and benzene molecules under applied conditions.

Figure 3 Pulsing
isotope exchange results with 13CH4 → 12CH4 (a, b) and CD4 →
CH4 (c, d) switching over the 2% Mo catalyst, which was
induced by 14 pulses of 13CH4 and 20 pulses
of CD4, followed by a thorough flushing with Ar flow and
pulsing nonlabeled methane. Distribution of benzene isotopologues
just before switching to unlabeled methane and for the next 10 pulses
after the switch (a, c), MS profiles of benzene signals during the
first pulse after the switch (b, d). Conditions: 700 °C, 0.3
g of 2% Mo catalyst, 5 mL pulses every 200 s, Ar carrier flow 30 mL/min.

The distribution of benzene isotopologues
obtained from the 13C isotope experiments (Figure 4a) is close to the distribution
expected from a random
statistical distribution at 20.3% of 13C. A slight excess
of heavy isotopologues 13C6H6, 13C512C1H6, and 13C412C2H6 and
pure 12C6H6 was observed. This observation
implies that formed benzene might be in equilibrium with surface carbon
species. On the other hand, the concentration of labeled carbon in
methane molecules is much lower than that in benzene and naphthalene
molecules (Figure 4b). Therefore, the observed isotope exchange is not the result of
coke hydrogenation to form labeled methane, which is then further
converted to labeled benzene. In other words the following reaction
sequence does not significantly contribute to the process:    

Figure 4 (a) Distribution of benzene isotopologues after
the first 12CH4 pulse plotted together with
the random distribution
corresponding to 20.3% concentration of 13C atoms. (b)
Development of 13C incorporation into methane, benzene,
and naphthalene molecules with the number of 12CH4 pulses after the switch. The dashed line represents the 1.1% natural
abundance of 13C.

In such a case, the concentration of 13C label
in methane
and in aromatic molecules would have to be the same. As the 13C labels are included selectively into the aromatic molecules, the
following overall reaction takes place:  

In this mechanism, mixed benzene isotopologues
stem from initial
methane activation products (e.g., methyl radicals or ethylene) reacting
with the surface species. Previously, we reported that a part of the
confined polyaromatic species has a radical character. We also found
a correlation between the concentration of organic radicals and the
amount of benzene formed during the induction stage.27 Therefore, we argue that radical pathways likely play an
important role in the formation of benzene via surface intermediates.

Pulse reactions and isotope labeling studies showed that the surface
carbon formed in the Mo/ZSM-5 pores in addition to the deactivation
plays an active intermediate role in the MDA catalytic cycle. The
insertion of surface carbon and hydrogen atoms into the benzene molecules
likely proceeds via a reaction between the confined polyaromatics
and the products of initial methane activation. Under the applied
conditions, the contribution of scrambling through reverse hydrogenation
of benzene and surface carbon to methane is not significant.

Evolution
of Surface Carbon Species
The results presented
in the previous section are related to the induction period, i.e.,
the very beginning of the MDA process. In the following sections,
we discuss the properties of carbon species formed during the later
reaction stages. First, we determined the remaining microporous volume
of Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts by Ar physisorption and the total coke content
by TG analysis as functions of the time on stream of the MDA reaction.
The linear correlation between the amount of coke and the remaining
microporous volume (Figure 5) suggests that the carbon is predominantly located on the
internal surface. As shown by Okkel et al.,30 the deposition of carbon on the external surface of the zeolite
would not result in a significant decrease of microporosity that can
be probed by Ar physisorption.

Figure 5 Correlation of the remaining microporous
volumes of 1% Mo and 5%
Mo catalysts with the coke content. The samples were produced by performing
the MDA reaction at 700 °C for 0, 5, 15, 60, and 960 min.

Ar physisorption results demonstrate
that carbon species block
the pores of 1% Mo and 5% Mo catalysts in a similar manner, independent
of the Mo content. In contrast, the results of TG analysis are quite
dependent on the Mo loading. Figure 6 shows that increasing the Mo content leads to an increased
contribution of “soft” coke at about 450–550
°C. Furthermore, the main combustion feature at 550–600
°C shifts to a lower temperature as the Mo loading increases.
In our previous work we showed that at a Mo loading above 2 wt % a
significant fraction of Mo remains as large Mo–oxo clusters
on the external surface of fresh catalysts.11

Figure 6 (a)
DTG profiles and (b) dependences of the temperature of the
main TG peak and the concentration of “soft” coke on
Mo loading for Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts exposed to methane at 700 °C
for 16 h.

XPS results (Figure 7) demonstrate that the concentration
of Mo on the external surface
of 5% Mo catalyst is much higher than on 2% Mo/ZSM-5 and particularly
1%Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts, not only before but also after the MDA reaction.
Reduced Mo clusters on the external surface are known to be easily
oxidized to MoO3,7 which can
catalyze the combustion of coke and therefore be responsible for the
low-temperature DTG feature. Indeed, impregnation of activated carbon
(AC) with increasing amounts of ammonium heptamolybdate gradually
decreases the temperature necessary to oxidize the carbon from 600
°C (for pristine AC sample) to 450 °C for the 5% Mo/AC sample
(Figure 8). Clearly,
MoO3 is an efficient combustion catalyst that, if present
on the external zeolite surface, can influence the combustion behavior
of carbonaceous materials. We argue therefore that the apparent high
amount of soft coke on 5% Mo/ZSM-5 is most likely related to the MoO3-catalyzed combustion of carbon species located on/near the
external zeolite surface. Moreover, the heat generated during the
combustion of these species results in the shift of the main DTG to
lower temperature.

at 700 °C for 16 h.

Figure 8 DTG profiles of activated carbon and the same carbon impregnated
with 1, 2, and 5 wt % Mo metal present in the form of ammonium heptamolybdate.

As the majority of carbon species
are located in the micropores,
XPS cannot be used to characterize these species (Figure S3). To examine
the chemical nature and evolution of coke species we performed a 13C NMR spectroscopy study, applying labeled 13CH4 for the samples with low carbon content to enhance the quality
of spectra. First, we analyzed 5% Mo catalysts exposed to methane
for different periods of time and found that the DTG-derived amount
of “hard” coke gradually increases with time on stream
at the expense of the “soft” coke contribution (Figure 9a). This observation
can be explained by a slow diffusion of oxygen and combustion products
inside the micropores at increasing carbon content.31 The NMR spectra of these samples feature only one NMR signal
at about 130 ppm (Figure 9b). The intensity of the signal increases with time on stream
but the position and relative width remain the same. This signal is
assigned to sp2 carbon of aromatic nature. No signals corresponding
to sp or sp3 carbon were observed.

Figure 9 DTG profiles (a, c) and 13C MAS NMR spectra (b, d) of
5% Mo/ZSM-5 samples exposed to methane at 700 °C for different
times (a, b) and comparison with 5% Mo/silicalite-1 and 10% Mo/silica
catalysts after 16 h of CH4 treatment. Labeled 13CH4 methane was used to prepare the 5% Mo samples, except
of 5%, 960 min. Spent Mo/silicalite-1 and Mo/SiO2 samples
were prepared with normal CH4.

A comparison of NMR and DTG data shows that the combustion
properties
of coke are not related to its structure, as samples with completely
different “hard/soft” coke distribution are very similar
from the NMR perspective. To underpin this conclusion, we also analyzed
spent nonacidic Mo/silicalite-1 and nonmicroporous Mo/SiO2 samples. Spent Mo/SiO2 is characterized by a single low-temperature
DTG feature, while Mo/silicalite-1 displays a low- and a high-temperature
feature similar to Mo/MFI sample but shifted to lower temperatures
(Figure 9c). A stronger
contribution of “soft” coke in Mo/silicalite-1 can be
explained by the higher external surface concentration of Mo on the
SiO2 support that does not contain Brønsted acid sites.32 Despite these differences, 13C NMR
spectra of spent Mo/silicalite-1 and Mo/ZSM-5 are similar (Figure 9d). The 13C NMR signal in spent Mo/SiO2 is significantly broadened,
characteristic of large (pre)graphitic structures, formed on the surface
of silica in absence of micropores.33

To summarize, the 13C NMR and DTG data show that there
is no significant chemical difference between the MDA coke burning
at low temperature and at high temperature. The low-temperature contribution
is related to MoCx species located on
the external surface of spent samples. These species are easily oxidized
to MoO3, which is an efficient combustion catalyst. The
high-temperature contribution is related to the decreased accessibility
of oxygen to the zeolite micropores. The transport of these molecules
in the zeolite pores decreases with increasing coke content, resulting
in the shift of the combustion features to the higher temperatures
and the apparent “hardening” of the coke species.

Liberation of Carbon Material from the Zeolite
In order
to gain a deeper insight into the properties of carbonaceous deposits
formed during MDA, we dissolved a spent (16 h in methane flow at 700
°C) 1% Mo catalyst in HF solution, filtered the remaining solid
off, and thoroughly washed it with water. The ash content of the obtained
carbon product was below 4%(Figure 10, inset). After liberation of the coke from the zeolite
pores, its combustion profile shifted (∼100 °C) to a significantly
lower temperature (Figure 10). This finding is in line with the conclusion that burning
the coke molecules inside the zeolite pores is more difficult due
to the presence of coke that blocks diffusion of oxygen.

Figure 10 DTG profiles
of 1% Mo-spent (black) and the product remained after
dissolving the inorganic fraction in HF (red). Inset shows TG profiles
of the two samples; inorganic fraction of the sample after dissolution
in HF is below 4%.

Electron microscopy
analysis reveals that the liberated carbonaceous
deposits remain particulate and the size and shape of the primary
particles are comparable to the parent zeolite crystals (Figure 11). Moreover, since
we did not observe any hollowness of the particles by TEM (Figure 11c), it can be concluded
that the polyaromatic species (inter)grow throughout the whole zeolite
crystal volume.

Figure 11 SEM image of (a) 1% Mo-spent sample, (b) SEM and (c) TEM
images
of the carbon product remained after dissolving the inorganic fraction
of 1% Mo-spent in HF.

The analysis of the Ar adsorption isotherm of the liberated
carbon
material (Figure 12) shows that it possesses a significant microporous volume of 0.07
cm3/g with micropore distribution peaks centered around
5.9, 9.0, and 12.0 Å. The carbon material also contains mesopores
(mesoporous volume of 0.23 cm3/g) and the total BET surface
area is 340 m2/g.

pore size distribution
(right) of 1% Mo-spent sample after dissolving the inorganic fraction
in HF.

The properties of the carbonaceous
deposits formed during MDA are
similar to those of zeolite-templated carbons (ZTC). These materials
can be obtained by high-temperature pyrolysis of organic precursors
such as ethylene or furfuryl alcohol inside the zeolite pores, followed
by HF dissolution of the zeolite template.34 The resulting ZTCs are three-dimensional carbon networks displaying
varying degrees of order. More generally, ZTCs are porous particulate
materials that consist of curved graphene moieties intergrown inside
the pores with morphology of particles usually similar to the parent
zeolite crystals. ZTCs are promising for numerous applications in
catalysis, adsorption, optics, and fuel cells.35 It should also be mentioned that ZTC materials are known
to possess dangling bonds, protected by the zeolite framework.36 This fact can explain the radical nature of
the polyaromatic species confined in ZSM-5, as reported in our previous
work.27

We modeled the MFI-templated
carbon by filling a silicalite-1 model
with sp2-hybridized C atoms, placing acenes in the straight
channels, connected by phenacene chains via the sinusoidal channels,
and pyrene-like moieties in the intersections.27 The phenacene chains were found to offer the best balance
between filling of the sinusoidal channels, the fit and flexibility
as compared to other candidate polyaromatics. As a result linear acenes
of infinite length lay along the straight channels in the b-direction
and slightly twisted picene moieties connect the straight acenes to
form a three-dimensional framework (Figure 13). Two types of micropores were found in
this model. The first type of pores runs along the b-direction and has dimensions of 8.2 × 12.2 Å. The second
type of pores can be viewed along the a-axis and
has dimensions of 5.9 × 13.9 Å. These sizes are present
in the NLDFT-derived pore size distribution of the liberated carbon
material (Figure 12), which confirms the plausibility of the model.

Figure 13 Structural model of
an MFI-templated ZTC material: (a) view along b-axis
in the direction of straight channels, (b) close
view along the a-axis, and (c) close view along the b-axis.

The used model, however,
does not account for the structural defects,
such as missing linkages and incomplete intergrowth. An important
aspect of ZTCs is that their crystallinity depends on the topology
of the zeolite template. Highly crystalline ZTC materials with low
defect densities and surface areas above 4000 m2/g can
be obtained with three-dimensional 12-membered ring (MR) zeolites,
such as FAU, BEA, and EMT.37 Synthesis
of ZTC from the 10-MR MFI zeolite results in more disordered materials
with no apparent crystalline structure, attributed to steric constraints.38 Such disorder was also observed in this work,
manifested by a high mesoporous volume and moderate surface area.
Nevertheless, the NMR, TG, electron microscopy, and Ar adsorption
results obtained in this work are with the range of properties previously
reported for MFI-templated ZTCs.39−41 We expect that the method
of direct ZTC synthesis from methane over Mo/zeolite materials can
be extended to other zeolite topologies as well. These results show
that it is possible to synthesize microporous zeolite-templated carbons
directly from methane, which will lead to new possibilities for these
interesting materials.

Conclusions
Formation of heavy carbonaceous
deposits is an intrinsic property
of the MDA reaction. It is highly undesirable as large polyaromatic
species block the zeolite pores and lead to the catalyst deactivation.
However, these species also play an active intermediate role, as we
showed by pulse reaction experiments and isotope labeling. Furthermore,
within the sensitivity limit of 13C NMR, the structure
of coke, formed during MDA, does not depend on time on stream and
acidity of the zeolite support. The often reported distinction between
“soft” and “hard” coke can be explained
solely by the MoOx-catalyzed combustion
of near-surface carbon (“soft” coke feature) and diffusion
limitations experienced by molecules of oxygen and combustion products
when the zeolite micropores become gradually blocked by the polyaromatic
molecules (“hard” coke feature). Finally, the carbon
material formed during the MDA after dissolution of the zeolite framework
possesses all properties of MFI-templated carbon materials. Conversion
of methane over Mo/zeolite catalysts, therefore, offers a direct synthesis
route from methane to zeolite-templated carbons.
