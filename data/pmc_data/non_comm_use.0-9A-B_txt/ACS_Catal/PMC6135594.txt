Cobalt
oxide Co3O4 has recently emerged as promising,
noble metal-free catalyst for oxidation reactions but a better understanding
of the active catalyst under working conditions is required for further
development and potential commercialization. An operando approach
has been applied, combining near ambient (atmospheric) pressure X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), or X-ray diffraction (XRD) with simultaneous catalytic tests
of CO oxidation on Co3O4, enabling one to monitor
surface and bulk states under various reaction conditions (steady-state
and dynamic conditions switching between CO and O2). On
the basis of the surface-specific chemical information a complex network
of different reaction pathways unfolded: Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK),
CO dissociation followed by carbon oxidation, and formation of carbonates.
A possible Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) pathway cannot be excluded
because of the good activity when no oxygen vacancies were detected.
The combined NAP-XPS/FTIR results are in line with a MvK mechanism
above 100 °C, involving the Co3+/Co2+ redox
couple and oxygen vacancy formation. Under steady state, the Co3O4 surface appeared oxidized and the amount of
reduced Co2+ species at/near the surface remained low up
to 200 °C. Only in pure CO, about 15% of surface reduction were
detected, suggesting that the active sites are a minority species.
The operando spectroscopic studies also revealed additional reaction
pathways: CO dissociation followed by carbon reoxidation and carbonate
formation and its decomposition. However, due to their thermal stability
in various atmospheres, the carbonates are rather spectators and also
CO dissociation seems a minor route. This study thus highlights the
benefits of combining operando surface sensitive techniques to gain
insight into catalytically active surfaces.

1 Introduction
Controlling
automotive emissions during an engine’s cold start is an unresolved
issue, resulting from the strong CO adsorption on noble metals, poisoning
the catalyst at low temperature (<200 °C).1,2 Due
to their low-temperature CO oxidation ability, transition metal oxides,3 especially cobalt oxide, are promising.4,5 Despite intensive studies, the nature of the active sites of cobalt
oxide catalysts as well as exact reaction mechanisms are still debated
and contradicting results concerning the role of Co3+/Co2+, of different oxygen species, oxygen vacancies, and carbonates
were reported.

The active sites are often attributed to the
abundance of specific cobalt cations. In 2009, Xie et al. reported
that Co3O4 nanorods, predominately exposing
(110) planes and enriched in Co3+ cations, exhibit very
high activity for low-temperature CO oxidation. The high catalytic
activity was ascribed to Co3+ cations,5 but no spectroscopic evidence was given. Two years later
the same group reported that Co3O4 nanosheets
with (111) planes, enriched in Co2+ cations, were the most
active among nanorods, nanocubes, and nanoparticles,6 contrasting with the previous report. Jia et al. observed
that a Co3O4–SiO2 nanocomposite
catalyst, without ordered planes, but enriched in Co2+,
exhibited very high activity at low temperature.4 Recently, it was reported that CoO with octahedrally coordinated
Co2+ had unexpectedly high activity due to the ease of
surface oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+.7 Nevertheless, all conclusions were primarily
based on catalytic studies and no direct spectroscopic evidence of
the active surface oxidation state was provided.

A recent study
by Iablokov et al. using different particle sizes (2 to 10 nm) showed
a maximum rate between 5 and 8 nm. This was explained by a higher
concentration of Co3+ 3d states, as revealed by XPS.8 Ding et al. reported an enhanced activity of
flower-like Co3O4 with an increased number of
surface Co3+.9 All findings
illustrate that there are still open questions concerning the nature
of active sites, i.e., the abundance of Co3+/Co2+ and Co3O4/CoO.

With respect to the reaction
mechanism, it was suggested that CO adsorbs to Co3+ cations,
followed by abstracting surface lattice oxygen coordinated to three
Co3+ cations, with the oxygen vacancy later replenished
by gas phase oxygen (Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism).5 Studying the effect of pretreatment conditions, Yu et al.
proposed a reaction between a molecularly adsorbed CO and molecularly
adsorbed O–O peroxo species, but without spectroscopic evidence.10 However, Jia et al. did not detect peroxo O–O
species by in situ Raman spectroscopy.4 In an in situ IR study, Pollard et al.11 suggested that CO adsorbed on Co2+ sites reacted with
an oxygen atom bonded to a neighboring Co3+ cation, and
the oxygen vacancy was replenished by oxygen from the gas phase. In
his early work on the CO oxidation mechanism, Jansson et al. had already
proven lattice oxygen extraction using isotopes, i.e., the redox Mars-van-Krevelen
mechanism.12−14 He also found that CO disproportionation takes place
during CO oxidation. Mechanistic insights were also gained from reaction
orders. The study of Perti et al. on CO oxidation kinetics on Co3O4–Al2O3 revealed
reaction orders of CO and O2 being 0 and 0.42, respectively15−17 and their study suggested two competitive mechanisms: reaction of
CO with adsorbed oxygen (Langmuir–Hinshelwood LH) and with
lattice oxygen (MvK).15−17

The CO oxidation mechanism on cobalt oxide
has also been examined by theoretical work,18−21 also showing divergences. For
example, Jiang et al. suggested a MvK mechanism for Co3O4 (110).21 Pang et al. proposed
two scenarios: direct reaction of CO with surface lattice oxygen atoms
(MvK) but also direct reaction of preadsorbed molecular O2 with molecular CO from the gas phase.20,22

A better
understanding of CO oxidation on cobalt oxide would clearly benefit
from an evaluation of the surface oxidation state of the active catalyst,
as well as of the surface species present. Applying operando (in situ)
techniques for studying the catalyst surface under reaction conditions
may enable to reveal the reaction network, which is required for setting
up a mikrokinetic model that could eventually explain the macroscopic
kinetics.23−25 The importance of surface composition changes of
a cobalt oxide model catalyst during methanol oxidation was, e.g.,
revealed by operando near atmospheric pressure X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (NAP-XPS).26 The goal of the
current study was to improve the understanding of the reaction pathways
occurring during CO oxidation on Co3O4. Thus,
NAP-XPS and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy monitoring
the surface changes and surface species were applied with simultaneous
catalytic activity tests by gas chromatography (GC) or mass spectroscopy
(MS). Experiments were performed under steady-state conditions (CO
+ O2), in CO atmosphere, and upon switching between CO
and O2. In addition, the effect of pretreatment conditions
on catalyst structure and activity was examined by operando XRD/MS.
Altogether, the operando studies provided new insight into the active
catalyst surface, several possible reaction pathways, and the presence
and stability of surface species.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Catalyst
Co3O4 was used as received from Fluka (purity 99.5%). The average crystallite
size of Co3O4 determined by X-ray diffraction
was 28 nm, the BET specific surface area was 38 m2g–1. According to TEM measurements, the material was
composed of nanospheres of 20 to 50 nm in size. A detailed catalyst
characterization was reported previously.27

2.2 Catalytic CO Oxidation
CO oxidation was
performed in a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor under atmospheric
pressure. The sample (ca. 20 mg, mixed with 100 mg quartz powder to
avoid mass and heat transfer limitations) was loaded into the reactor
and pretreated with synthetic air at 400 °C for 30 min (50 mL
min–1, heating rate of 10 °C min–1, standard pretreatment procedure). For studying the effect of pretreatment
conditions, oxidation at 400 °C in synthetic air was followed
by reduction at 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, or 400 °C
in 5 vol % H2 in N2. After cooling to 30 °C,
temperature-dependent CO oxidation was performed either with 5 vol
% CO and 10 vol % O2 in He or 5 vol % CO and 2.5 vol %
O2 in He. The total flow rate was 50 mL min–1, and the heating rate was 2 °C min–1. The
catalysts rapidly deactivate at room temperature (RT), why rather
higher reaction temperatures were examined. The concentrations of
CO and CO2 in the outlet stream were monitored by gas chromatography
(GC) using a HP-PLOT Q column and a flame-ionization detector (FID)
with a methanizer.

2.3 Operando XRD Measurements
Operando XRD experiments were performed on a laboratory diffractometer
(XPERT III: PANalytical XPert Pro MPD) using Cu–Kα radiation
(1.54 Å) operating in the Bragg–Brentano reflection geometry.
The diffractometer is equipped with an Anton Paar XRK 900 high-temperature
gas cell. In situ diffraction patterns were recorded in the scanning
range from 25° to 70° (2θ) using a step scan mode
with steps of 0.05° (2θ) and a time per step of 2 s. XRD
data were analyzed with the HighScore Plus program.

The inlet
of the Anton Paar XRK 900 high-temperature gas cell is connected to
a gas manifold system with calibrated mass flow controllers; the outlet
of the cell is connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) (PrismaPlus
QMG 220, Pfeiffer Vacuum, SEM detector). The Co3O4 (ca. 20 mg) was placed into a sample holder, inserted into the cell
and pretreated in synthetic air at 400 °C (30 min). Afterward,
the reaction mixture of 5 vol % CO, 10 vol % O2, and 85
vol % He was introduced and XRD patterns were recorded at room temperature
(RT), 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, and 250 °C. The
same experiment was done after pretreatment in synthetic air at 400
°C followed by reduction in 5 vol % H2 in He at 400
°C (30 min). For in situ H2-temperature-programmed
reduction, the samples were pretreated in synthetic air at 400 °C
(30 min), then cooled to RT, purged with He, and then 5 vol % H2 in He was introduced. XRD patterns were recorded at RT, 100
°C, 200 °C, 300 °C, and 400 °C. All experiments
were performed at atmospheric pressure with a total flow of 50 mL
min–1.

2.4 Operando NAP-XPS Measurements
Operando near ambient (atmospheric) pressure X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) was performed at the ISISS beamline at the
synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin,
Germany. The setup consisted of a reaction cell attached to a set
of differentially pumped electrostatic lenses and a separately pumped
analyzer (Phoibos 150 Plus, SPECS GmbH), as described elsewhere.28 Typically, the powder sample (ca. 30 mg) was
pressed into a tantalum grid (to minimize potential charging effects)
together with a K-type thermocouple, fixed to a sapphire sample holder
and mounted inside the XPS reaction cell in front of the first aperture
of the differentially pumped electrostatic lens system. The heating
of the samples was done from the back using an infrared laser. Before
the catalytic experiments, the sample was pretreated in the XPS reaction
cell by oxidation (0.5 mbar O2 at 400 °C) until all
residual surface carbon and carbonates disappeared. After cooling
the sample to RT, the CO + O2 reaction mixture (1:2 ratio
at 0.5 mbar) was introduced with the partial pressure of the gases
controlled by calibrated mass flow controllers, and the photoemission
spectra were recorded. Then, the sample was heated to 100 °C,
150 °C, and 200 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1, and photoemission spectra were again acquired at
these temperatures. For CO vs O2 switching experiments,
CO (0.15 mbar) was introduced at RT and photoemission spectra were
recorded for ∼30 min, then the atmosphere was changed to O2 (0.15 mbar), again collecting spectra for ∼30 min.
Then, Co3O4 was heated in O2 to the
next temperature and the procedure was repeated. Such experiments
were performed at RT, 100, 150, and 200 °C. To ensure surface
sensitivity, the Co 2p and C 1s core-level regions were recorded using
selected photon energies that resulted in photoelectrons with 200
eV kinetic energy and a ∼0.6 nm inelastic mean free path. The
gas phase composition was monitored online by an electron impact quadrupole
mass spectrometer, which was connected to the XPS cell via a gas dosing
valve.

XPS spectra were analyzed using the CasaXPS package.
All binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the second-order O
1s peak. The accuracy of the BE calibration was estimated to be around
0.05 eV. A Shirley-type function was used to remove the background
arising from energy loss for Co 2p, and either a Shirley- or a linear-type
function was used in the case of C 1s. The extracted spectra were
then fitted with a combined Gaussian and Lorentzian line profile.
The peak positions of Co 2p and C 1s, full width at half-maximum (fwhm),
and constraints are presented in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting
Information, SI).

2.5 Operando FTIR Measurements
Operando FTIR studies were
carried out in transmission mode using a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer
(liquid N2-cooled MCT detector, resolution of 4 cm–1) in a stainless steel transmission flow cell equipped
with CaF2 windows. The inlet of the cell was connected
to a gas manifold system with calibrated mass flow controllers. The
sample (ca. 4–5 mg) was pressed into a pellet, which consisted
of a thin catalyst layer supported on a KBr pellet, and placed in
a small cylindrical stainless steel sample holder equipped with a
ring-shaped furnace and a type-K thermocouple. All infrared spectra
were collected in the 4000–900 cm–1 range
by averaging 256 scans to achieve good signal-to-noise ratio. A spectrum
of the empty sample holder recorded in He was used for background
subtraction for all spectra, which were evaluated with the OPUS 4.0
software. During operando FTIR measurements catalytic CO oxidation
was simultaneously monitored by gas chromatography
(Figure S5).

Before each experiment,
the catalyst was pretreated in synthetic air (50 mL min–1) at 400 °C for 30 min (heating rate 10 °C min–1), cooled to 30 °C under a flow of synthetic air, and purged
with He for 10 min.

CO Oxidation
the reaction mixtures,
(i) 5 vol % CO, 10 vol % O2 in He; (ii) 5 vol % CO, 5 vol
% O2 in He; or (iii) 5 vol % CO, 2.5 vol % O2 in He were passed through the cell at 25 mL min–1, and temperature-dependent spectra were recorded while heating to
250 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min–1.

CO-Temperature-Programmed Reduction Followed by Heating in O2 or He
Five vol % CO in He (25 mL min–1) was continuously introduced to the cell and temperature-dependent
spectra were recorded while heating to 250 °C. Then, the sample
was cooled to room temperature and temperature-dependent spectra were
recorded during heating to 200 °C in 5 vol % O2 in
He or in pure He.

CO vs O2 Switching Experiments
CO (5 vol % CO in He) was introduced and five IR spectra were consecutively
recorded within 10 min, then the atmosphere was changed to O2 (5 vol % O2 in He) again collecting five IR spectra within
10 min. Then, Co3O4 was heated in O2 to the next temperature and the procedure was repeated. Such experiments
were performed at RT, 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, and 250
°C.

CO2 Adsorption
Five vol
% CO2 in He (25 mL min–1) was continuously
passed through the cell and temperature-dependent spectra were recorded
while heating to 200 °C.

3 Results
3.1 Operando XRD under Steady State Conditions: Influence of Pretreatment
on CO Oxidation Activity
The CO oxidation activity strongly
depended on the CO/O2 ratio (Figure S1; as reported previously), why a 1:2 ratio was used for most
experiments. To examine the influence of the (bulk) cobalt oxidation
state, the Co3O4 catalyst was pretreated in
different ways: by oxidation in synthetic air at 400 °C; or by
oxidation at 400 °C followed by reduction in 5 vol % H2 in N2 at 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, and 400
°C. After pretreatment, CO oxidation was carried out in 5 vol
% CO and 10 vol % O2 in He. The temperature-dependent CO
conversion for differently pretreated Co3O4 is
presented in Figure 1a and summarized in Table 1. Co3O4 pretreated in synthetic air
or in synthetic air/H2 (100 °C or 200 °C) was
active already at ∼80 °C, reaching 100% CO conversion
at ∼110–120 °C (apparent activation energy around
70 kJ/mol). In contrast, for preoxidized Co3O4 reduced in H2 at 300 °C or 400 °C, CO conversion
started at higher temperature (∼120 °C) and reached 100%
at 160 °C and 170 °C, respectively. This is accompanied
by an increase in apparent activation energy to around 110 kJ/mol,
suggesting a different rate-determining step and different active
sites (Figure S2).

Operando
XRD upon CO oxidation on Co3O4 pretreated in
synthetic air and in synthetic air followed by 5 vol % H2 at 400 °C are shown in Figure 1b for 200 °C, with more details
in Figure S2. After standard preoxidation,
Co3O4 remained Co3O4 at
all reaction temperatures (Figure S2a),
in agreement with the in situ XRD study of Jansson et al.14 Although the bulk structure of Co3O4 does not undergo structural changes during CO oxidation,
the topmost surface layers could still be affected, as discussed below.

The low catalytic activity after reduction at 300 °C or 400
°C is due to the reduction of Co3O4 to
metallic cobalt, as revealed by in situ XRD (Figures 1b and S3) and
in situ XAS at the Co K edge reported in our previous study.27 Upon heating in the 1:2 CO/O2 mixture
the metallic cobalt is gradually reoxidized and CO conversion increases
at 150–200 °C. This is evident from operando XRD (Figure 1b) indicating metallic
cobalt, CoO and Co3O4 at 200 °C. At 250
°C the oxidation was still incomplete (Figure S2b). As mentioned, XRD is a bulk characterization technique,
and the surface composition of the catalyst might be different, calling
for surface sensitive techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
and infrared spectroscopy.

3.2 Operando Spectroscopy under
Steady State Conditions
3.2.1 Operando NAP-XPS
To gain spectroscopic insight into CO oxidation, we have utilized
operando NAP-XPS, which provides surface-specific information on the
cobalt oxidation state and formation of oxygen vacancies (by probing
the Co 2p region), as well as on adsorbate species (by probing the
C 1s region). Within our previous study of preferential CO oxidation
(PROX),27 CO-temperature-programmed reduction
(CO-TPR) NAP-XPS indicated that CO reduced the top surface layers
of Co3O4, forming CoO, Co, and oxygen vacancies,
whereas elementary carbon, carbonates, and CO-Co3+/CO-Co2+ were observed in the C 1s region. Similarly, herein operando
NAP-XPS (KE = 200 eV, probing depth ∼0.6 nm) was carried out
during CO oxidation (0.15 mbar CO and 0.3 mbar O2), as
a function of reaction temperature (Figure 2). The assignment of Co 2p peaks was based
on literature:29 the peak at 779.4 eV corresponds
to Co3+, the peak at 780.9 eV to Co2+ in CoO,
and that at 782.4 eV to Co2+ in Co(OH)2.

Figure 2 Operando NAP-XPS
during CO oxidation on Co3O4 from RT to 200
°C (0.15 mbar CO and 0.3 mbar O2): (a) the Co 2p region
(hν = 1015 eV, KE = 200 eV); (b) MS catalytic
data recorded during NAP-XPS; (c) the C 1s region (hν = 465 eV, KE = 200 eV); (d) the absolute amount of carbon
species; and (e) the relative ratio between carbon species, both calculated
from a linear peak fit.

At first, Co 2p XPS did not indicate any surface reduction
of Co3O4 in CO+O2, neither at RT
nor at higher temperature (i.e., there were no shakeup satellites)29,30 (Figure 2a). To better
reveal changes, all spectra were normalized, plotted together (Figure S4a) and a difference spectrum of spectra
at 200 °C and RT was calculated (Figure S4b), which point to minor surface reduction at the detection level
at 200 °C. Note that (pure) CO induced surface reduction and
formation of oxygen vacancies particularly above 100 °C.27 Thus, during CO oxidation (i.e., in the presence
of an excess of O2) only minute surface reduction occurred.
This indicates a rapid dynamic reduction/reoxidation of the cobalt
oxide surface in the CO+O2 mixture under steady state.
Catalytic data recorded in parallel to NAP-XPS (Figure 2b) agreed with those from the fixed-bed flow
reactor.

The C 1s region revealed three peaks during CO oxidation
(Figure 2c), characterizing
carbonates (288.2 eV),31−33 elementary carbon (284.7 eV),34 and CO adsorbed to cobalt (i.e., CO-Co3+/CO-Co2+) (286.1 eV).35 The peak positions
and fwhm are listed in Table S1. The absolute
amount of elementary carbon, carbonates, and weakly adsorbed CO increased
from RT to 100 °C, but decreased upon further heating (Figure 2d). The relative
amount of C was 32% at RT and 44–47% at 100–200 °C
(Figure 2e), assuming
identical sensitivity for all species.

In contrast, during CO-TPR
(O2 absent) the intensity of carbon species increased with
temperature.27 The ratio of elementary
carbon to carbonates and adsorbed CO was larger: the fraction of C
was 52% at RT and 78% at 200 °C.27 Also, increasing temperature in CO led to Co3O4 reduction to CoOx and formation of oxygen
vacancies. Since the C concentration was much higher in pure CO, the
oxygen vacancies are likely the reaction sites of CO dissociation
(cooperating with neighboring Co cations). In the presence of oxygen,
vacancies are refilled and less carbon is produced. Thus, O2 of the reaction mixture may hinder the growth of C by keeping the
surface oxidized and thus preventing CO dissociation, or O2 just reoxidizes C deposited by CO dissociation.

3.2.2 Operando FTIR Spectroscopy
Operando FTIR spectroscopy
enables studying adsorbed species, thus contributing in identifying
reaction pathways. A number of IR studies have reported carbonates,4,13,14,32 but their exact role, whether being reaction intermediates, spectators,
or poisons remained unclear. Carbonates have also frequently been
observed for CO-containing reactions on oxide supported metals.36,37 Systematic operando FTIR studies were performed to unravel their
role, applying three feed compositions (Figure 3): CO/O2 = 1:2; 1:1; 2:1.

Figure 3 Operando FTIR
spectra recorded during CO oxidation on Co3O4 in flow mode (25 mL min–1) from RT to 250 °C
in different gas mixtures: 50 mbar CO, 100 mbar O2 (black);
50 mbar CO, 50 mbar O2 (red); and 50 mbar CO, 25 mbar O2 (green).

All operando FTIR spectra
exhibited the characteristic gas-phase bands of CO (2110 and 2170
cm–1) as well as bands in the 1000–1650 cm–1 region, attributed to various carbonate vibrations.
In contrast to NAP-XPS, operando FTIR did not show any bands of (linearly
adsorbed) CO on Co2+ or Co3+. The CO stretching
frequencies of cobalt carbonyls were reported at 2023–2025
cm–1 for metallic cobalt, 2070–2110 cm–1 for Co+, 2120–2170 cm–1 for Co2+, and 2178–2180 cm–1 for Co3+.14 Thus, the 2178–2180
cm–1 on Co3+ band could be masked by
gas-phase CO.

In the FTIR cell, carbonate formation started
at RT whereas CO2 production began around 150 °C,
increasing with temperature. The assignment of surface carbonates
is based on literature38,39 and IR stretching vibrations
are presented in Table S3. The carbonates
at RT were mainly monodentates (1494, 1375, 1320 cm–1). Upon temperature increase, bidentates evolved (additional bands
at 1620, 1555, and 1280 cm–1). It is important to
note that all FTIR spectra were recorded on the same pellet of Co3O4, allowing to quantitatively compare intensities
and the amount of adsorbed species.

FTIR spectra of the three
gas mixtures mainly differed in the stability of the carbonates. Under
O2-rich conditions (CO/O2 = 1 to 2) the signal
intensity increased from RT to 170 °C, between 170 °C and
200 °C additional bidentate carbonates were formed, but at 220
°C carbonates started to disappear and no carbonates were present
above 220 °C (Figure 3). The appearance of bidentate carbonates was accompanied
by an increase in CO conversion (CO2 gas-phase peak; Figure 3). The disappearance
of carbonate peaks was accompanied by a further increase of the CO2 gas-phase peak and an overall increase of CO conversion.
The decreasing carbonate intensity above 220 °C is likely due
to lower stability of carbonates in O2 excess.

In
the reaction mixture with an initial CO/O2 ratio of 1:1,
a relatively high amount of carbonates was still present at 220 °C
and higher temperatures were required to make them disappear. When
the CO to O2 ratio was stoichiometric (CO/O2 = 2:1), the amount of carbonates was even higher and the concentration
of carbonates increased continuously up to 250 °C.

In summary,
the more reducing (CO rich) the reaction atmosphere was, the higher
the amount and stability of surface carbonates became. This suggests
that upon temperature increase more sites were formed (likely by reduction
of the Co3O4 surface), that were active for
CO adsorption and carbonate formation. Whether excess O2 reduces the amount of carbonates formed or just facilitates carbonate
decomposition/desorption to CO2 cannot be answered at this
point. On the basis of static IR experiments, the potential contribution
of carbonates to the overall activity cannot be assessed. Thus, gas
switching experiments were performed both for NAP-XPS and FTIR.

3.3 Operando Spectroscopy upon Switching between
CO and O2
3.3.1 NAP-XPS
To lift
the limitations of steady state spectroscopy, switching experiments
were monitored by NAP-XPS (Figures 4, 5, S6, S7, and S8). CO/O2 switching (each 0.15 mbar for
∼50 min) was carried out at RT, 100 °C, 150 °C, and
200 °C, simultaneously recording Co 2p and C 1s spectra (KE =
200 eV; Figures 4, 5, and S7) and MS of reactants
and CO2 (Figure S6). Taking
into account the attenuation of photoelectrons in the gas phase, a
CO/O2 ratio of 1 was used (0.15 mbar CO vs 0.15 mbar O2; similar scattering was confirmed by comparing Co 2p peak
intensities).

Figure 4 Operando NAP-XPS on Co3O4 during
CO/O2 switching (0.15 mbar CO vs 0.15 mbar O2), Co 2p3/2 region (hν = 1015 eV;
KE = 200 eV): comparison in CO and O2 at (a) RT and (b)
200 °C; the Co 2p3/2 region at various temperatures
in (c) CO and (d) O2; (e) difference spectrum (Co 2p3/2 200 °C in CO-Co 2p3/2 RT in O2).

Figure 5 Operando NAP-XPS C 1s region (hν = 465 eV; KE = 200 eV) on Co3O4 during
CO/O2 switching (0.15 mbar CO vs 0.15 mbar O2). The absolute amount of carbon species was calculated from a linear
peak fit.

Figure S6b demonstrates that changing the atmosphere from O2 to
CO produced CO2 already at RT, but increased with temperature.
Note that before introducing the reacting gas (e.g., CO) into the
NAP-XPS chamber, the other reacting gas (e.g., O2) was
evacuated from the chamber, in order to keep the Co3O4 catalyst free from physisorbed molecules.

A significant
increase in CO2 evolution at 200 °C and continuous
CO2 production for ∼30 min upon switching to CO
indicates that not only surface lattice oxygen may take part in CO2 production, but also oxygen from the bulk. The shape of the
MS curve, a sharp peak followed by a slow decrease, points to fast
reaction with surface oxygen (decaying fast upon consumption) and
a slower reaction with bulk oxygen, which needs to diffuse to the
surface. If only surface oxygen would react, then CO2 production
should have dropped quickly. A gradual (slow) decrease in CO2 evolution is observed at 200 °C, which may be caused by catalyst
deactivation by carbon (C 1s region, Figure 5) or by slow diffusion of oxygen from deeper
(bulk) layers.

CO disproportionation to C and CO2 may also contribute to the slower pathway. The amount of CO2 produced at 200 °C during steady state CO oxidation
(0.15 mbar CO and 0.3 mbar O2; Figure 2b) was 1.34 × 10–10 a.u. The amount of CO2 produced at 200 °C in the
presence of pure CO (0.15 mbar CO; Figure S6b) was 6.10 × 10–12 a.u. (after ∼5 min)
and 3.61 × 10–12 a.u. (after ∼30 min)
that is 22–37 times lower than the catalytic activity in CO
+ O2.

In the opposite case, when O2 was
introduced after CO, there was only minor CO2 production,
likely due to surface carbonate decomposition (and then O2 reoxidized the surface). The MS data were confirmed by analogous
experiments in the catalytic flow reactor.

Figures 4 and 5 display the corresponding Co 2p3/2 and C 1s spectra.
Upon switching to CO, the Co3O4 surface oxidation
state did not change at RT (no satellites appeared in Co 2p), whereas
more pronounced changes of Co3+/Co2 were observed at higher temperature, especially at 200 °C (Figures 4a,b, and S7). In CO at 200 °C, the Co3+ concentration decreased by 15%, as compared to O2. The
amount of reduced sites upon switching was quantified via the spectral
intensities (i.e., the ratio between Co3O4 and
CoO). This indicates that CO reduces part of the surface, while O2 reoxidizes it, as expected for the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism
(which has been proven by numerous experimental and theoretical studies.5,12,13,18−21) Figure 4d suggests
that reoxidation (0.15 mbar O2) was not complete though,
but a tiny amount of reduced Co2+ species persisted.

With respect to the C 1s region, elementary carbon increased with
temperature in CO, whereas switching to O2 strongly decreased
the (amorphous) carbon (interestingly, O2 partially oxidizes
carbon even at RT) (Figures 5 and S8). Thus, it is possible
that a (minor) reaction pathway toward CO2 proceeds via
CO dissociation followed by carbon oxidation to CO/CO2.
In contrast, the carbonates decreased to a considerably lower extent
at higher temperature, indicating that carbonate decomposition was
more difficult than the reoxidation of carbon.

Carbonate formation
has been previously reported for Co3O4,4,13,14 but the observed carbon deposition
has been scarcely discussed in literature (indirect investigations
by Jansson12,13 in the course of isotope studies).
The current C 1s NAP-XPS data directly indicate carbon formation on
Co3O4 during CO exposure and CO oxidation.

The simultaneous NAP-XPS/MS observations are in line with the redox
Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, but also point to a possible contribution
of CO dissociation, elementary carbon deposition, and carbon reoxidation, the extent of which is however unknown. The role of the various
carbonates remains ambiguous, why “switching” operando
FTIR spectroscopy was employed.

3.3.2 FTIR
Spectroscopy
Figure 6 shows operando FTIR spectra upon CO/O2 switching
(50 mbar CO vs 50 mbar O2) on Co3O4. CO was introduced first and consecutive IR spectra were acquired
for 10 min (each spectrum taking about 2 min), then the atmosphere
was changed to O2 and IR spectra were acquired after 2
and 10 min. Then, Co3O4 was heated in O2 to the next temperature before introducing CO again (performed
at RT, 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, and 250 °C). FTIR
shows that neither at RT nor at 100 °C carbonate decomposition
by O2 took place, not even during 10 min O2 exposure.
Mainly monodentate carbonates, apparently being quite stable, were
present. At 150 °C, the carbonate peak area decreased during
the first 2 min, and higher temperature decreased both mono- and bidentate
carbonates. At 200 °C and 250 °C, the carbonates strongly
decreased after 2 min and after 10 min no carbonates were present
anymore (Figure 6).
Overall, the surface carbonates seemed rather stable spectators, with
their intensity decreasing rather slowly and mostly at high temperature,
which rather excludes carbonates as reaction intermediates of fast
CO oxidation. Thus, carbonate formation/decomposition plays rather
a minor role beside fast CO oxidation (MvK). Deactivation/site blocking
by carbonates can also rather be excluded.

(50 mbar CO vs 50 mbar O2): spectra recorded during the
10th minute of CO exposure (black), during the 2nd minute of O2 exposure (red) and during the 10th minute of O2 exposure (green).

3.4 Carbonate Formation and Stability: FTIR Spectroscopy
3.4.1 Interaction of Co3O4 with Carbon Monoxide
To further examine carbonate formation, reactivity and stability,
the interaction of CO with Co3O4 was studied
by FTIR from RT to 350 °C (Figure 7a). Similar to CO+O2, no adsorbed CO but
only carbonates were observed. Mainly monodentate carbonates were
formed at RT, bidentate carbonates emerged at 100 °C, and the
overall carbonate intensity increased with temperature. This suggests
that at higher temperature more reactive sites are formed that enable
CO adsorption as a carbonate. Recall that NAP-XPS revealed partial
reduction of the Co3O4 surface and surface oxygen
vacancy formation in CO, especially from 100 °C to 200 °C.27 When more vacancies were created, CO could adsorb
as carbonate. Accordingly, heating in CO favors lattice oxygen extraction,
increasing the concentration of carbonates. Note that in CO the amount
of carbonates was significantly higher than that during CO oxidation
(even in a stoichiometric mixture at low temperature) (Figure S9). The higher concentration of carbonates
in CO as compared to O2-containing feed suggests that partial
Co3O4 surface reduction is beneficial for carbonate
formation. This will be discussed in the following.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra on Co3O4 recorded during: (a) adsorption of CO (50 mbar)
in flow mode (total flow 25 mL min–1) from RT to
350 °C; (b) pretreatment with CO at 200 °C, cooling in CO
to RT and heating in O2 (100 mbar O2 bar in
He, total flow 25 mL min–1); and (c) pretreatment
with CO at 200 °C, cooling in CO to RT and heating in He (total
flow 25 mL min–1).

3.4.2 Investigation of Carbonate Stability in
O2 and He Atmosphere
The thermal stability of
carbonates was examined in O2 and He atmospheres. FTIR
spectra were recorded after exposing Co3O4 to
CO at 200 °C and cooling in CO to RT (i.e., initial spectrum)
and during heating in 50 mbar O2 in He or in pure He. As
evident from Figure 7b, introducing O2 at RT already changed the carbonates,
forming additional monodentate carbonates appearing as a shoulder
at ∼1530–1470 cm–1. Heating in O2 to 100 °C decomposed both mono- and bidentate carbonates.
At 130 °C, the intensity of carbonate bands decreased to 1/3
of its initial value. At 150 °C, only a small amounts of monodentate
carbonates were left on the cobalt oxide surface, while at 200 °C
it was free of carbonates.

The thermal stability of carbonates
was also studied in He (Figure 7c). Again, FTIR spectra were recorded after exposing Co3O4 to CO at 200 °C, cooling down in CO to
RT and heating in He. Up to 100 °C, no significant carbonate
decomposition was observed. At 130 °C, carbonates started to
decompose. However, the decrease was faster for the 1380–1280
cm–1 peaks than for the 1600–1430 cm–1 peaks, indicating different thermal stability and
reactivity of surface carbonates. Importantly, at 150 °C carbonates
were still detected in He, whereas in O2 only a small amount
was present. The observation of carbonate peaks disappearing at about
200 °C is in agreement with CO-TPD reported in our previous study
(CO exposure at RT for 30 min followed by heating in He to 700 °C).27 Only CO2 evolved (and no CO) suggesting
lattice oxygen extraction from cobalt oxide.

3.4.3 Interaction
of Co3O4 with Carbon Dioxide
The results
presented so far (CO vs CO/O2) suggest that carbonate formation
requires, or is at least facilitated, by partial surface reduction
by CO. However, it is still unclear whether carbonates may also form
by readsorption of the reaction product CO2. Thus, preoxidized
Co3O4 was exposed to CO2 at RT and
heated to 200 °C (Figure S10a). Interestingly,
neither at RT nor during heating any CO2 adsorption/carbonate
was observed; CO2 remained in the gas phase (2336 and 2360
cm–1). This is in contrast to CO2 adsorption
on many other oxides such as ZrO238,40 or Al2O341 when
CO2 easily forms carbonates. The different affinity to
CO2 may be due to specific active sites or functional groups
(i.e., OH, basic surface oxygen) that are missing on Co3O4.

In another series of experiments, the interaction
of CO2 with Co3O4 prereduced by CO
or H2 (intended to create oxygen vacancies that seem required
for CO2 adsorption) was examined. (Figures S10b, S11, and S12). However, there was no CO2 adsorption or carbonate formation under all conditions. Thus,
it can be ruled out that the observed carbonates originate from CO2 readsorption. Rather, they are only formed by direct interaction
of Co3O4 with CO that partly reduces the Co3O4 surface. The higher concentration of surface
carbonates in CO as compared to O2-containing feed also
suggests this picture.

3.5 Discussion
Using operando NAP-XPS, FTIR, and XRD we have examined the (surface)
oxidation state of Co3O4 and adsorbates present
during CO oxidation, and compared them with those in pure CO and upon
switching between CO and O2. In particular, the comparison
of static (steady-state) and switching experiments provided valuable
information.

Combining information from NAP-XPS/FTIR and activity
tests revealed a complex network of different reaction pathways contributing
to CO oxidation on Co3O4. In the following Osurf, O#, and Oads refer to surface (lattice)
oxygen, oxygen (surface) vacancies, and adsorbed atomic oxygen. Some
pathways are reversible, others have been shown to be irreversible.(1) Direct
MvK pathway:

        (2) via CO dissociation and carbon oxidation:

        (3) via carbonates as intermediates:

      

Operando NAP-XPS and FTIR spectroscopy—in
particular based on switching experiments—were in accordance
with a fast CO oxidation route via a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism (1),
i.e., alternating reduction–oxidation of the Co3O4 surface by CO and O2. Carbon monoxide adsorbed
to cobalt cations reacts with lattice surface oxygen, and the created
oxygen vacancies (O#) are replenished by O2 from
the gas phase, further creating active Oads species.

In addition, adsorbed CO (likely near O#) may undergo
dissociation, filling an oxygen vacancy and depositing elementary
carbon on the surface, which can be reoxidized by O2 (once
more near O#) (2). CO dissociation likely occurs at/near
oxygen vacancies, as indicated by the larger amount of carbon present
under more reducing conditions when more oxygen vacancies are formed.
The carbon is quite reactive and is oxidized even at RT. Overall,
CO dissociation and carbon reoxidation seems an (unavoidable) additional
pathway of CO oxidation on Co3O4.

The
pronounced decline of surface carbonates appearing at higher temperature
(at 200–250 °C the surface of Co3O4 is almost free of carbonates) suggests that the stable carbonates
play a minor role, being rather spectators (3). Decomposition of carbonates
to CO2 is, however, facilitated by (excess) O2.

Below 100–150 °C, oxygen vacancies cannot be
detected but Co3O4 exhibits considerable activity.
A contribution via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) reaction can
thus not be excluded. For methane oxidation on cobalt oxide spinel
nanocubes Zasada et al.42 reported that
at 300–450 °C the LH mechanism was dominant, whereas above
450 °C, LH and MvK coexisted.

The spectroscopically examined
possible reaction pathways/elementary steps of CO oxidation on Co3O4 are summarized in Figure 8. Clearly, surface reduction by CO, reoxidation
by O2, CO dissociation/reoxidation presumably at vacancies,
and (to a lesser extent) carbonate formation/decomposition are key
processes, demonstrating the complexity of the seemingly simple CO
oxidation.

4 Conclusions
Combining
surface-specific chemical information from operando NAP-XPS and FTIR
spectroscopy with activity tests revealed a complex network of four
different reaction pathways of CO oxidation on Co3O4: redox Mars-van-Krevelen, CO dissociation followed by carbon
oxidation, formation of carbonate spectators, and possibly Langmuir–Hinshelwood
at low temperature (which can currently not be excluded). Experiments
performed under steady-state and dynamic conditions were in accordance
with a MvK mechanism above 100 °C, involving the Co3+/Co2+ redox couple and oxygen vacancy formation. Under
steady state, the Co3O4 surface appeared oxidized
and only in pure CO about 15% Co2+ species at/near the
surface were detected, suggesting the active sites being minority
species. CO dissociation followed by carbon reoxidation and carbonate
formation/decomposition are additional reaction pathways. Nevertheless,
stable carbonates are rather spectators and also CO dissociation may
be a minor route.

This work demonstrates the benefits of combining
several operando techniques for studying catalysts under steady state
and dynamic conditions, revealing a complex network of reaction pathways.
Nevertheless, to assess the relative contributions of all pathways
and to determine the rate limiting step, further studies would be
required (e.g., by transient/concentration modulation IR spectroscopy43 and detailed (micro)kinetic modeling).23−25
